<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 001021 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND OES </p><p>STATE PASS EPA </p><p>AMMAN FOR ENVIRONMENT HUB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, EPET, ALOW, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: OIL SMOKE CLOUDS OVER KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 920 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  People in Kuwait awoke March 21, 2003, to a dark </p><p>sky north of the city.  Post confirmed through US military </p><p>sources that the smoke clouds were caused from multiple oil </p><p>well fires burning in Iraq and started by the Iraqis. </p><p>Kuwait\'s Environment Public Authority (EPA) said the sky </p><p>looked worse than it actually was and that the pollution </p><p>first registered in Kuwait shortly after midnight did not </p><p>pose any immediate health risks.  With winds forecast to </p><p>continue blowing north to south over the next few days, more </p><p>oil smoke was anticipated, and the EPA said it would notify </p><p>post should the pollution reach dangerous health levels.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. Dr. Mohammad Al-Sarawi, Chairman of Kuwait\'s Environment </p><p>Public Authority (EPA), told Econoff his organization began </p><p>detecting low but rising levels of "sulfur oxide" in the </p><p>Kuwaiti air shortly after midnight March 21, indicating </p><p>hydrocarbons from burning oil.  The EPA takes air samples </p><p>every five minutes from six fixed stations located throughout </p><p>the country, as part of its Emergency Response program </p><p>(reftel). </p><p> </p><p>3. At dawn, the sky north of the city appeared a dark </p><p>purple-gray color.  US military sources in Kuwait confirmed </p><p>later in the morning that the pollution was caused by </p><p>multiple oil fires burning in Iraq, which were started the </p><p>previous night by the Iraqis.  Fires were burning in the </p><p>southern portion of Iraq\'s large Al-Rumaylah oil field, a </p><p>small portion of which straddles the border into Kuwait, </p><p>where it is called Radqa oil field. </p><p> </p><p>4. Dr. Sarawi said the pollution had not reached dangerous </p><p>health levels.  He explained that the dark sky was caused by </p><p>smoke trapped in the "inversion layer," held between colder </p><p>and warmer air on either side, much like smog in an urban </p><p>environment.  In  Kuwait\'s northern city of Jahra, the sulfur </p><p>oxide level reached only 10 parts per billion, he said, and </p><p>would have to reach more than ten times this amount to pose </p><p>inhalation risks.  He added that by early afternoon the sky </p><p>had cleared and the level of pollution had decreased </p><p>throughout Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>5. Dr. Sarawi said that he received several telephone calls </p><p>from Kuwaiti and international media outlets with questions </p><p>about the oil fires, but that his emergency operations center </p><p>had not received any calls from concerned people living in </p><p>Kuwait.  Likewise, Post\'s operations center did not receive </p><p>any calls from American citizens asking about the pollution. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT: Given that many Kuwaitis and some Americans </p><p>living in Kuwait were here during the Gulf War and remember </p><p>how retreating Iraqi troops set hundreds of oil wells on </p><p>fire, turning the skies over Kuwait City black for months, </p><p>this most recent episode pales by comparison.  Nonetheless, </p><p>Dr. Sarawi agreed to immediately inform Post should pollution </p><p>from oil fires or other sources reach dangerous health </p><p>levels, so that we can notify our staff and the larger Amcit </p><p>community. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
