<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001636 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, OSCE, PKK </p><p>SUBJECT: OCALAN\'S LAWYERS, BROTHER VISIT FOR FIRST TIME IN </p><p>15 WEEKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1624 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1303 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 972 </p><p>     D. ADANA 44 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was visited March 12 </p><p>for the first time since November 27 by his brother Mehmet </p><p>and three attorneys.  Jandarma officials had previously </p><p>blocked visits to Ocalan\'s Imrali Island prison, supposedly </p><p>due to stormy weather (Reftels B-D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Comment: This visit will do little, by itself, to </p><p>relieve mounting tensions among Turkish Kurds, who fear they </p><p>will suffer a GOT crackdown if/when the fighting starts in </p><p>Iraq.  By isolating Ocalan for such an extended period with </p><p>such a flimsy excuse, the GOT has sent a clear message to the </p><p>Kurds, as it did March 13 when it took legal actions against </p><p>two pro-Kurdish parties (Reftel A). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
