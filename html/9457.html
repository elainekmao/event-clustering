(C) Charge and newly-arrived DCM met Foreign </p><p>Secretary Nihal Rodrigo july 17.  Rodrigo quickly focused on </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>issue MFA had raised before (reftels) of status of Iraqi </p><p>Embassy in Colombo.   He had heard from Sri Lankan Ambassador </p><p>in Baghdad that Iraqi Ambassador in Colombo was part of the </p><p>problem, and that Iraqi Embassy operations here would be </p><p>suspended.  He said he hoped that, pending reopening, there </p><p>could either be a protective power here to represent Iraqi </p><p>interests, or that the Iraqi Ambassador in Delhi would be </p><p>accredited to Colombo as well.  He again cited the </p><p>significant economic interest the GSL has in its tea trade </p><p>with Iraq (at the pre-war high point, Iraq took 61 percent of </p><p>Sri Lanka,s tea exports). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Charge said we were inquiring of Washington about </p><p>the longer-term status of the Iraqi mission in Colombo and </p><p>would get back to him on that.   He assured Rodrigo that we </p><p>had no objection to issuance of visas to the two Iraqi </p><p>diplomats in New Delhi seeking entry to Colombo </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Request Department clarify status of Iraqi </p><p>Embassy closure/suspension here, and comment, if possible, on </p><p>FonSec,s alternative options. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
