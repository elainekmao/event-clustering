(U) Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please protect </p><p>accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Ensuring timely and effective implementation of the </p><p>U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) continues to be </p><p>the centerpiece of our economic relations with Vietnam.  The </p><p>BTA continues to be our best tool to achieve a broad range </p><p>of policy objectives in the coming years.  It is now 14 </p><p>months since the U.S. -Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement </p><p>came into force on December 10, 2001 and almost one year </p><p>since the USAID-funded Support for Trade AcceleRation (STAR) </p><p>Project began working with the Vietnamese government, </p><p>joining our other USG sponsored technical assistance </p><p>programs provided by individual agencies and the U.S.- </p><p>Vietnam Trade Council (USVTC).   The GVN has made </p><p>significant changes since December 2001, although progress </p><p>has been uneven.   The bulk of Vietnam\'s core commitments </p><p>were due upon entry and we believe that the GVN is in most </p><p>cases making a good faith effort to meet most of those </p><p>obligations in the face of continued weak capacity.  The GVN </p><p>spent much of the last year trying to formulate action plans </p><p>for implementation by reviewing the legal framework and </p><p>assessing needed changes to bring laws, rules, and </p><p>regulations into conformity with the BTA.  The USG has been </p><p>instrumental in assisting the GVN take on this sizeable and </p><p>complicated task. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The trade playing field is starting to level slowly </p><p>- US exports increased more than 30% in 2002, primarily due </p><p>to lower tariffs but also due to increased interest in the </p><p>market.  The GVN still plays a dominant role in Vietnam\'s </p><p>economy but the private sector is seeing robust growth, with </p><p>strong job creation and a growing percentage of industrial </p><p>production.  International economic integration is </p><p>proceeding with a number of AFTA commitments kicking in this </p><p>year even if WTO accession talks are proceeding more slowly </p><p>than expected.  Legal reform continues to occupy center </p><p>stage in the GVN\'s implementation efforts, with several </p><p>significant new or revised laws, rules, and regulations </p><p>passed in 2002.  While the GVN is behind schedule in a </p><p>number of areas, overall, progress is being made. We will be </p><p>meeting with the Government of Vietnam (GVN) March 10 for </p><p>the second annual U.S.-Vietnam Joint Committee under the BTA </p><p>(following expert level talks on March 4-5).  The following </p><p>scene setter provides Embassy review of the status of BTA </p><p>implementation, an update on the progress of various </p><p>technical assistance programs, and issues that should be </p><p>highlighted at the Joint Committee. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>The Honeymoon is Over </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) When DUSTR Huntsman and then Minister of Trade Vu </p><p>Khoan convened the first BTA JC last May, we were clearly </p><p>still in the "honeymoon" period after the ratification and </p><p>entry-into-force of the agreement.  The atmosphere for these </p><p>talks has changed - the honeymoon is definitely over. Vu </p><p>Khoan has moved up to the Deputy Prime Minister\'s office and </p><p>former Minister of Trade and BTA negotiator Truong Dinh </p><p>Tuyen has once again picked up the reigns at MOT.    The </p><p>antidumping case on frozen fish fillets (or the fish </p><p>formerly known as catfish) and threats of an antidumping </p><p>case on shrimp have quickly dissipated much of the positive </p><p>political capital that should have been accruing this year </p><p>based on the tremendous success of Vietnam\'s exports to the </p><p>U.S.  In addition, the US and Vietnam will have just begun, </p><p>if not finished, textile negotiations - which will put in </p><p>place an agreement to limit the exports to the U.S. of </p><p>textiles - one of Vietnam\'s fastest growing export </p><p>commodities this past year.  In many ways, the reality of </p><p>the required BTA commitments has started to sink in and is </p><p>perhaps at contrast with original expectations and </p><p>understanding of what the BTA would do.   Many GVN officials </p><p>viewed the BTA as the culmination of a process rather than </p><p>the beginning, and have genuinely been surprised by recent </p><p>trade disputes with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) We should acknowledge Vietnam\'s progress and </p><p>encourage continued reform, while stressing the need for </p><p>Vietnam to move more quickly to reflect its BTA commitments </p><p>in law and in practice.  Many GVN officials either do not </p><p>understand (or choose not to understand) which issues fall </p><p>under the BTA and which fall under the category of general </p><p>trade relations.  On the date of entry into force, the U.S. </p><p>fully met all its obligations under the BTA; the GVN\'s </p><p>obligations are phased in over 9 years and the GVN is still </p><p>struggling to implement many obligations that were due upon </p><p>entry.  Thus, any time there is an assessment of the </p><p>progress of BTA implementation, the GVN, by default, bears </p><p>the brunt of the criticism.  While the GVN may have </p><p>legitimate complaints regarding the catfish antidumping </p><p>case, they are also clearly searching for issues to raise </p><p>under the BTA to "even the score", such as limitations on </p><p>business visas or other "business facilitation" issues.  In </p><p>addition, the GVN has and will likely continue to downplay </p><p>the tremendous success Vietnam has seen on the trade side </p><p>this past year.  In a period where Vietnamese exports to </p><p>other countries either decreased or remained relatively </p><p>static, exports to the U.S. increased more than 100 percent. </p><p>By any definition, this is an impressive result.   In the </p><p>MOT\'s official report on implementation sent to the Prime </p><p>Minister in December, however, the MOT stated that although </p><p>the trade relationship had taken some "promising steps in </p><p>the spirit of the BTA. trade turnover figures between the </p><p>two countries remain low, and some matters have arisen </p><p>showing inequality in the trade relationship between the two </p><p>countries, notably the catfish dispute." </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The GVN has had difficulty in ensuring enforcement </p><p>of BTA implementation at the provincial levels - a problem </p><p>that, if not addressed more effectively by the GVN, will </p><p>seriously impede Vietnam\'s ability to meet its BTA </p><p>commitments - particularly in the area of investment.  With </p><p>little ability to force provincial officials to toe the </p><p>line, the GVN has focused on an information campaign </p><p>regarding obligations under the BTA to try to bring those </p><p>officials along - with only mild success.  One key GVN </p><p>official argued that it is difficult to convince the </p><p>provincial and local governments that the BTA will benefit </p><p>them in the face of the frozen fish fillet and other trade </p><p>disputes.  We need to impress upon the GVN that ultimately </p><p>the central government alone bears the responsibility to </p><p>ensure that central, provincial, and local government </p><p>officials fully implement the BTA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>BTA - The WTO and Beyond </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) This visit presents another important opportunity </p><p>to remind the Vietnamese of the broader implications and </p><p>benefits associated with implementation of the BTA.  The BTA </p><p>is the GVN\'s most effective roadmap to reform consistent </p><p>with international standards.  The reform and international </p><p>integration efforts called for under the BTA are critical to </p><p>the GVN\'s own growth and development objectives.  WTO member </p><p>countries see Vietnam\'s progress in BTA implementation as an </p><p>indication of how serious Vietnam is in its efforts to </p><p>integrate.  If BTA implementation falters, Vietnam\'s efforts </p><p>to accede to the WTO will be setback significantly.  We also </p><p>need to remind the Vietnamese that the benefits of the BTA </p><p>reach far beyond the quick boost in trade that lower tariffs </p><p>promise; proper implementation will create in Vietnam the </p><p>type of environment that will attract high quality </p><p>investment and trade. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Issues for the Joint Committee </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) While other members of the delegation will have an </p><p>opportunity in the "expert sessions" to explore fully the </p><p>technical issues of implementation, there are a number of </p><p>key themes that DUSTR Huntsman may wish to address in the </p><p>plenary session on March 10. </p><p> </p><p>THEME ONE:  The U.S. already has fully implemented the BTA </p><p>and opened wide its market to Vietnamese goods, services and </p><p>investment.  Vietnam is already reaping significant benefits </p><p>from this market access. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) The overall tone of our discussion should be </p><p>positive and cooperative, but we also must lay down </p><p>appropriate markers that we will not ignore Vietnam\'s </p><p>commitments and that greater effort must be made to stick to </p><p>the implementation timetable.   We continue to need to </p><p>stress the point that the U.S. has already fully implemented </p><p>the BTA.  This is perhaps even more important now that much </p><p>GVN rhetoric over the last year has focused on "lack of U.S. </p><p>commitment" to the spirit if not the letter of the BTA due </p><p>to the catfish antidumping case and other irritations in the </p><p>bilateral economic relationship.  The GVN has sought to </p><p>bring all disagreements under the rubric of the "spirit of </p><p>the BTA."  MOT\'s year-end report on the status of BTA </p><p>implementation concluded, ""Although the US undertook to </p><p>liberalize trade, it has in fact erected barriers and needs </p><p>to take anti-dumping and other measures." </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The GVN has on several occasions implicitly and </p><p>explicitly linked BTA implementation with favorable outcomes </p><p>on unrelated issues - most specifically the frozen fish </p><p>dumping case.  In October, during a meeting with USG </p><p>officials, an official from the Office of the Government </p><p>(the Prime Minister\'s office) attempted to explicitly link a </p><p>"reasonable resolution" of the frozen fish fillet dumping </p><p>case to progress on IPR and other BTA implementation issues. </p><p>DPM Vu Khoan echoed this sentiment recently when he told </p><p>news agencies that the decision by the USDOC that Vietnam is </p><p>dumping frozen fish fillets on the U.S. market will "curb </p><p>the acceleration of BTA implementation."  In addition, at </p><p>the one-year anniversary of the BTA, the GVN seemed to make </p><p>a conscious decision to downplay the enormously successful </p><p>results on the trade side - not acknowledging that we had </p><p>opened our markets fully and that Vietnam has benefited </p><p>significantly. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The GVN has also failed to acknowledge when the </p><p>U.S. is actively enforcing its BTA commitments, such as </p><p>trademark protection.  The GVN has complained about several </p><p>cases where competing trademark applications for Vietnamese </p><p>products, such as Trung Nguyen (coffee) and PetroVietnam </p><p>have been filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. </p><p>Although the cases are being handled appropriately, i.e. in </p><p>a transparent and legalistic manner, the GVN has attempted </p><p>to link the lack of political intervention in the process as </p><p>evidence of a lack of will by the USG to uphold its </p><p>commitments, stating that "the US has complained that </p><p>Vietnam is late in implementing TRIPS, whereas in fact under </p><p>the BTA both sides are in breach." </p><p> </p><p>THEME TWO:  The U.S. and Vietnam have worked together in a </p><p>positive and constructive manner to assist the GVN in its </p><p>reform effort and implementation of the BTA. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The progress over the last year across the board </p><p>on cooperative, constructive engagement has been </p><p>significant.  USG agencies and our technical assistance </p><p>providers have worked with the GVN on issues ranging from </p><p>training for Supreme Court justices to international </p><p>arbitration to rule of law and sectoral issues like tariff </p><p>reform, insurance, and banking reform.  USG technical </p><p>assistance and our providers are working with more than 40 </p><p>government ministries, departments, agencies and local </p><p>people\'s committees.  The breadth and depth of this effort </p><p>should be highlighted and commended on both sides.  We </p><p>should stress that we place a priority on continued positive </p><p>momentum and real results. </p><p> </p><p>THEME THREE:  Vietnam has made commendable progress in </p><p>implementing new legislation, but many laws, regulations and </p><p>administrative practices do not yet meet BTA obligations. </p><p>Despite this, we expect that U.S. nationals, products and </p><p>companies will be accorded BTA treatment even when existing </p><p>regulations are contradictory. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Over the last year, a number of important laws </p><p>have been drafted or revised, such as the Law on the </p><p>Promulgation of Legal Normative Documents ("Law on Laws") </p><p>and the Ordinance on Most Favored Nation and National </p><p>Treatment, bringing them closer to BTA compliance but in </p><p>some cases still falling short.  Additionally, numerous </p><p>others remain inconsistent with BTA obligations that were </p><p>due upon entry-into force, due at the one year mark or are </p><p>due in the near future.  While acknowledging the depth and </p><p>breadth of the Vietnamese effort to reform the legal </p><p>framework, we should strongly emphasize that regardless of </p><p>the status of reform of laws and regulations, we expect that </p><p>Vietnam will meet its commitments and provide assurances </p><p>that U.S. nationals, products, and companies will be </p><p>accorded BTA treatment even when existing regulations are </p><p>contradictory. </p><p> </p><p>THEME FOUR:  Normal, active trade and economic </p><p>relationships require regular dialogue.  Encourage Vietnam </p><p>to work with us on a daily basis to resolve ongoing issues </p><p>on both sides. The key is to work together to resolve </p><p>issues in a cooperative manner. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) The GVN tends to see political messages behind </p><p>even minor technical trade/economic issues and thus often </p><p>reserves problems or concerns for discussion at high-level </p><p>meetings, such at the annual Joint Committee meetings. </p><p>While we will always have a mismatch of delegation of </p><p>authority (i.e. we make decisions at much lower levels), </p><p>this preference for a more formal route for what may be </p><p>mundane or minor issues is a less-than-efficient use of </p><p>senior officials time.  Additionally, many of the questions, </p><p>problems, and issues that have been informally proposed for </p><p>Joint Committee meetings could easily be resolved through </p><p>informal working level discussions (for example questions </p><p>about SA8000 certification).  We should stress that as our </p><p>economic relations expand, issues will arise - it is a </p><p>normal if somewhat unfortunate situation.  We should </p><p>encourage the GVN to relay issues as they come up so that </p><p>they can be addressed quickly in the appropriate forum. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>General update on implementation </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>Trade in Goods </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) MFN/National Treatment for Imports:  Vietnam did </p><p>enact an NT and MFN ordinance this year which covers goods </p><p>as well as services, and investment (Hanoi 1766) and that\'s </p><p>a good start.  However, a broad array of regulations related </p><p>to VAT taxes, special inspection and quality-control </p><p>requirements and rules for trading that are not applied </p><p>equally to domestic goods remain inconsistent with Vietnam\'s </p><p>commitments to provide national treatment, except for </p><p>exempted goods.  Vietnam is currently working to bring these </p><p>regulations into conformity but we need to stress we expect </p><p>BTA treatment regardless. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) In 2002 the USAID-funded STAR project provided the </p><p>GVN with detailed analysis of key pieces of legislation </p><p>related to the Trade in Goods chapter of the BTA including </p><p>the draft Ordinance on Commercial Arbitration, the draft </p><p>Commercial Law, and the draft Ordinance on E-Commerce.  STAR </p><p>also provided training and workshops on E-Commerce, trade </p><p>policy procedures and customs issues.  USG-funded technical </p><p>assistance projects related to trade in goods planned for </p><p>2003 include: </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Follow-up assistance in revising and implementing </p><p>the draft Ordinance on Commercial Arbitration and the draft </p><p>Commercial Law. </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Training and technical assistance for Customs on </p><p>meeting BTA obligations. </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR, USDOC) Support for a conference on trade-related </p><p>technical standards for the Ministry of Science and </p><p>Technology (MOST). </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Provide support to the Ministry of Fisheries in </p><p>implementing BTA obligations. </p><p> </p><p>-- (USVTC) A study tour in the U.S. on technical regulations </p><p>and standards.  Participants will include:  GVN officials </p><p>from the MOT, MOST, the Ministry of Health (MOH), and the </p><p>Ministry of Industry (MOI) as well as the National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p>-- (USVTC) A study tour in the U.S. on Sanitary and </p><p>Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures.  Participants will include: </p><p>GVN officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural </p><p>Development (MARD), MOH and MOT. </p><p> </p><p>Intellectual Property Rights </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) Vietnam has come a long way in revising </p><p>legislation to bring its IPR laws into compliance with its </p><p>BTA commitments, but gaps remain.  Commitments related to </p><p>trademarks and patents were due 12 months after entry into </p><p>force (December 2002); commitments on copyright and trade </p><p>secrets are due in May 2003.  The main issue continues to be </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>lack of IPR enforcement, particularly with respect to </p><p>copyrights and trademarks.  Vietnam committed in the BTA, </p><p>upon entry-into-force, to enforce existing laws, the U.S.- </p><p>Vietnam Copyright Agreement, and the Paris Convention.  No </p><p>such routine and reliable enforcement exists.  While there </p><p>have been some well-publicized raids over the last year, </p><p>they are few, ineffective and prompted by the </p><p>copyright/trademark holders with little to no independent </p><p>action by GVN authorities. </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) Microsoft, for example, worked with HCMC law </p><p>enforcement officials earlier this year to raid shops </p><p>selling pirated Microsoft software.  Authorities raided 6 or </p><p>7 of the probably hundreds of shops in the city which openly </p><p>sell pirated software.  Only nominal fees were levied (12 </p><p>million Dong per violator, or approximately USD 780), there </p><p>has apparently been no follow up by local authorities, and </p><p>the shops quickly re-opened.  Although the raids can be seen </p><p>as a positive first step, clearly much needs to be done </p><p>before Vietnam can be considered serious in addressing IPR </p><p>enforcement concerns. </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) In 2002 the STAR program supported several seminars, </p><p>workshops and conferences on IPR for judges, court </p><p>officials, government officials, business leaders and IP- </p><p>related agencies.  STAR also sent a delegation from the </p><p>Supreme People\'s Court to Thailand to learn about Thailand\'s </p><p>specialized IP court.  USG-funded technical assistance </p><p>projects related to IPR planned for 2003 include: </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Support the Ministry of Culture and Information </p><p>(MOCI) in the development of stronger regulations for </p><p>optical disc production and distribution. </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Provide detailed comments to the Ministry of </p><p>Justice (MOJ) on the revision of Part VI of the Civil Code, </p><p>which establishes the legal basis for IP protection in </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Support GVN efforts to meet the standards </p><p>necessary to accede to the IP conventions cited in the BTA. </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Provide support to the Supreme People\'s Court and </p><p>Customs in meeting BTA IPR-related obligations. </p><p> </p><p>-- (USVTC) Conduct a study tour to the U.S. on IPR issues, </p><p>particularly those related to Special 301.  Participants </p><p>will include officials from the MOCI. </p><p> </p><p>-- (USVTC) Conduct a study tour to the U.S. on IPR </p><p>enforcement issues.  Participants will include:  GVN </p><p>officials from the MOCI, MOST, Customs, and the Supreme </p><p>People\'s Court. </p><p> </p><p>Trade in Services </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) Vietnam\'s commitments to provide increased market </p><p>access, MFN and National treatment to US service providers </p><p>are phased in over 2 to 9 years after entry-into-force of </p><p>the agreement (depending on the sector).  However, in some </p><p>areas Vietnam has begun on a case-by-case basis to grant </p><p>greater access by U.S. firms in advance of its BTA </p><p>obligations in some limited sectors (insurance, banking). </p><p> </p><p>21. (U) In 2002 STAR organized workshops, a study tour, and </p><p>provided detailed comments on revisions to the draft Decree </p><p>on Foreign Lawyers.  STAR also supported workshops and </p><p>conferences on E-Commerce, telecommunications, and financial </p><p>services.  USVTC conducted a study tour to the U.S. on WTO </p><p>services issues.  In addition, in cooperation with the </p><p>Embassy, the Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) </p><p>hosted a two-day seminar for key GVN and State Bank </p><p>officials in early January related to banking reform, and </p><p>plans to host another seminar at the end of February.  USG- </p><p>funded technical assistance projects related to Trade in </p><p>Services planned for 2003 include: </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Provide technical support to the Ministry of Post </p><p>and Telecommunications (MPT), the State Bank of Vietnam </p><p>(SBV), the Ministry of Construction and the Ministry of </p><p>Finance (MOF) on BTA implementation issues related to </p><p>telecommunications, construction and financial services. </p><p> </p><p>-- (USVTC) Conduct a study tour to the U.S. focused on </p><p>implementation of BTA obligations related to </p><p>telecommunications services and banking and financial </p><p>services.  Participants will include:  GVN officials from </p><p>the MPT, the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), the Ministry </p><p>of Planning and Investment (MPI), the Office of the </p><p>Government and the National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p>-- (USVTC) Conduct a study tour to the U.S. on banking and </p><p>financial sector development.  Participants will include: </p><p>officials from the SBV, the MOF and the Office of the </p><p>Government. </p><p> </p><p>Investment </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>22. (U) The 2000 revised Law on Foreign Investment </p><p>represents a significant step forward in bringing the GVN\'s </p><p>investment regime into compliance with the BTA.  However, </p><p>Vietnam still has much work to do to bring its laws and </p><p>regulations on foreign investment fully into conformity with </p><p>BTA obligations that were due upon entry-into-force.  Most </p><p>of the inconsistencies are related to a lack of national </p><p>treatment.   Additionally, even where the laws are clear, </p><p>the GVN has had difficulty enforcing them at the provincial </p><p>and local levels.   Enforcement of arbitral awards and the </p><p>courts interpretation of Vietnam\'s obligations under the New </p><p>York Convention are other areas for particular concern. </p><p> </p><p>23. (SBU) At the First BTA Joint Committee, we raised the </p><p>case of McCullagh Krong Ana Joint Venture, which involves a </p><p>U.S. company involved in a joint venture in Dak Lak province </p><p>that has been trying to buy out its Vietnamese partner since </p><p>1998.  Both the partner and MPI have approved the buyout. </p><p>However, the Provincial Department of Planning and </p><p>Investment in Dak Lak refuses to allow the transaction to </p><p>occur. The case potentially violates the National Treatment, </p><p>MFN and technology transfer portions of the investment </p><p>chapter. We are continuing to press the GVN to resolve this </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>24. (SBU) In a second case, the Mission has been assisting </p><p>Tyco Services Singapore since 2001 in its attempts to get </p><p>two arbitral awards enforced in Vietnam.  In January the </p><p>Vietnamese Supreme Court reversed a May 2002 landmark </p><p>decision by the Ho Chi Minh City Economic Court (supported </p><p>by the Ministry of Justice) that would have recognized an </p><p>international arbitral award for the first time.  We believe </p><p>that this case highlights the current lack of understanding </p><p>at the highest judicial levels of modern, market-based </p><p>normal business transactions (in particular the definition </p><p>of a commercial transaction or contract), Vietnam\'s </p><p>international obligations, and a continuing lack of </p><p>transparency in legal decisions.  It also raises questions </p><p>about Vietnam\'s ability to live up to its obligations under </p><p>the BTA and the New York Convention.  We understand that </p><p>Tyco officials are considering requesting a review of the </p><p>Supreme Court decision.  We recommend that this issue be </p><p>raised in the BTA Joint Committee meeting, not to argue the </p><p>merits of the case but to stress our expectation that U.S. </p><p>businesses will be treated fairly by the Judicial system and </p><p>that international commitments will be respected. </p><p> </p><p>25. (U) In 2002 STAR supported the MPI in the development </p><p>and publication of an "Investment Guidebook for Vietnam" and </p><p>provided MPI with detailed comments on proposed amendments </p><p>to Decree 24 on investment procedures.   In October, USVTC </p><p>hosted a delegation of eight inter-ministerial officials to </p><p>the U.S. to look at issues relating to Vietnam\'s membership </p><p>in the International Center for the Settlement of Investment </p><p>Disputes (ICSID).   USG-funded technical assistance projects </p><p>related to Investment planned for 2003 include: </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Provide support to MPI in its efforts to revise </p><p>the Law on Foreign Investment. </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Provide training related to implementing ICSID </p><p>procedures. </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Support MPI in 1) developing a website for </p><p>disseminating information on foreign investment policies and </p><p>procedures and 2) developing a systematic analysis of the </p><p>difficulties faced by foreign investors in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>-- (USVTC) Conduct a study tour to the U.S. on investment </p><p>and investment disputes. </p><p> </p><p>-- (USVTC) Conduct follow-on workshops on accession to </p><p>ICSID. </p><p> </p><p>Business Facilitation </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>26. (SBU) The GVN may raise the issue of business visas for </p><p>Vietnamese nationals.  On many occasions the GVN has </p><p>complained about 1) visa issuance requirements (which have </p><p>resulted in the refusal of applicants); how long the </p><p>application process takes; and 3) the short length of stay </p><p>allowed in the U.S.  Post will provide DUSTR Huntsman and </p><p>participants in the "expert sessions" with background and </p><p>talking points on this issue upon arrival in Hanoi. </p><p> </p><p>Transparency </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>27. (SBU) Vietnam moved forward on efforts to enhance </p><p>transparency, but Vietnam\'s laws, regulations, and rule- </p><p>making processes are still far from compliant with this </p><p>obligation.  After much debate, the National Assembly passed </p><p>a revised "Law on Laws" at the end of 2002, which is </p><p>supposed to provide the legal framework for many of the </p><p>changes related to transparency commitments that were due </p><p>upon implementation.   While the revised law made noteworthy </p><p>improvements, it still does not conform with BTA </p><p>obligations.  Of particular concern, the revised law 1) does </p><p>not adequately address the issue of public comment and 2) </p><p>does not include GVN orders, decisions, directives or </p><p>circulars in the definition of a "legal normative document." </p><p> </p><p>28. (SBU) Although many GVN officials will admit that in the </p><p>cases where Vietnam has circulated draft laws and </p><p>regulations to industry and technical assistance providers, </p><p>the end result has been much better laws and rules, the </p><p>National Assembly saw the issue of public comment in terms </p><p>of national sovereignty and deleted that provision from the </p><p>final version of the revised law. Likewise, when new rules </p><p>have been published well in advance of their effectiveness, </p><p>implementation has been much smoother and the rules have </p><p>been much better received by the business community. </p><p> </p><p>29. (SBU) However, Vietnam has not yet instituted a formal </p><p>regime to publish all laws, regulations, and administrative </p><p>practices promptly in a centralized source and in advance of </p><p>implementation to give companies an opportunity to adjust </p><p>their operations accordingly, and to provide opportunity for </p><p>input into the formulation process.  We have been trying to </p><p>follow this issue closely and work with US firms to ensure </p><p>that any lack of transparency regarding new rules and </p><p>regulations does not have a negative impact on their </p><p>operations.  There have been some noteworthy cases; at the </p><p>top of the list was a December 2002 decision by the Ministry </p><p>of Finance, which would have doubled import tariffs on auto </p><p>kits.  The decision was based on a non-public "official </p><p>letter" from the Prime Minister and although it was due to </p><p>take effect on January 1, as of December 18, it had not yet </p><p>been issued publicly, published in the Official Gazette or </p><p>officially conveyed to the auto producers.  (MOF </p><p>subsequently agreed to "delay" the decision.) </p><p> </p><p>30. (U) In 2002 STAR supported the Office of the </p><p>Government\'s efforts to develop an "Action Plan for </p><p>Transparency," provided detailed comments on proposed </p><p>revisions to the Law on Laws and the draft Decree on the </p><p>Official Gazette, and hosted conferences and workshops on </p><p>transparency related obligations.  USG-funded technical </p><p>assistance projects related to transparency planned for 2003 </p><p>include: </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Support GVN efforts to further revise the Law on </p><p>Laws and improve the legal framework for the Official </p><p>Gazette. </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Support the MOJ in drafting a new "Law on </p><p>Promulgation of Local Level Legal Normative Documents." </p><p> </p><p>-- (STAR) Support efforts to improve publication of laws and </p><p>court decisions at all levels of government. </p><p> </p><p>Burghardt </p><p></p></div>
