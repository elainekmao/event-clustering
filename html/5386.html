<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 BRASILIA 000306 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR SCRONIN, AMALITO, RSMITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECIN, PGOV, BR, WTRO, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) </p><p>SUBJECT: FTAA/WTO CONTINUITY DESPITE ASCENSION OF REGIONAL </p><p>INTEGRATION WITHIN ITAMARATY </p><p> </p><p>1. SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary.  Moving quickly to bring his ministry\'s </p><p>institutions in line with the new government\'s focus on South </p><p>American integration, and in particular, a reinvigoration of </p><p>Mercosul, Foreign Minister Amorim has announced the creation </p><p>of a new South America Under Secretariat.  One GOB official </p><p>described creation of the new under secretariat, as </p><p>indicative of a "watershed" in GOB policy concerning </p><p>Mercosul.  Despite the reorganization, there is a sense of </p><p>continuity regarding FTAA and WTO trade policy amongst our </p><p>key trade contacts within Itamaraty.  While some policy </p><p>changes are inevitable, they are expected to be more of </p><p>emphasis than of wholesale change of direction.  This is </p><p>largely due to the retention of Ambassador Clodoaldo Hugueney </p><p>as the main Itamaraty architect of FTAA and WTO trade policy. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>New Under Secretariat for South America </p><p> </p><p>3. The following details are chiefly based on Trade Officer\'s </p><p>recent conversations with Ambassadors Simas Magalhaes and </p><p>Valdemar Leao.  Working within a rigid structure that limits </p><p>the number of under secretariats in Itamaraty to four, </p><p>Foreign Minister Amorim has proposed creation of a new Under </p><p>Secretariat for South America to be headed by Brazil\'s </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Ambassador to Mexico, Luiz Felipe Macedo Soares.  In a </p><p>departure from past practice, the new Under Secretariat will </p><p>focus all political and economic activity associated with </p><p>South American, and particularly Mercosul, integration under </p><p>the direction of one person.  To this end, the Directorate </p><p>for Latin American Integration, previously under Ambassador </p><p>Hugueney\'s Under Secretariat for Integration and Economic and </p><p>Trade Affairs, will be shifted to the new under secretariat, </p><p>as will all relevant offices from the Under Secretariat for </p><p>Bilateral Political Affairs. In addition to internal Mercosul </p><p>economic matters, it is expected that the new under </p><p>secretariat will be responsible for "bilateral" Mercosul </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>trade negotiations with countries or country groups within </p><p>Latin America, e.g. with the Andean Community, Central </p><p>America, etc.  Ambassador Valdemar Leao of Itamaraty\'s </p><p>Economic Department told us on January 23 that the placement </p><p>of Mercosul-Mexican relations has not been finalized. </p><p>However, FTAA negotiations will definitely remain with U/S </p><p>Hugueney. </p><p> </p><p>4. Itamaraty must receive approval from the GOB Ministry of </p><p>Planning before the reorganization becomes official.  This </p><p>approval involves a cumbersome bureaucratic exercise as </p><p>Itamaraty currently is by law not allowed to exceed four </p><p>under secretariats and must develop a plan consistent with </p><p>other limits on the number and level of certain positions. </p><p>As a result, all political affairs, multilateral as well as </p><p>bilateral with countries outside the region, are expected to </p><p>be merged into one Under Secretariat for Political Affairs. </p><p>Leao as good as said that he and other Itamaraty veterans saw </p><p>this portfolio as being an all but impossible burden for one </p><p>individual.  The implication was that it would cause de facto </p><p>shifts in responsibilities within Itamaraty unless the </p><p>Ministry gains future permission to expand to a fifth under </p><p>secretariat. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FTAA and Mercosul-EU Remain Key </p><p> </p><p>5. U/S Hugueney reportedly supported the reorganization, </p><p>which will allow his trimmed down Under Secretariat of </p><p>Economic and Trade Affairs to focus on what are Brazil\'s most </p><p>important trade negotiations -- the FTAA and Mercosul-EU </p><p>negotiations.  To expand the depth of Itamaraty\'s expertise </p><p>for these negotiations, Hugueney has created an additional </p><p>bureaucratic layer by forming a new Department of </p><p>International Negotiations.  The new department, to be headed </p><p>by Ambassador Carlos Alberto Simas Magalhaes, will have only </p><p>two divisions: one will be the existing FTAA Coordinating </p><p>Office (COALCA), the other a new division for Mercosul </p><p>extra-hemisphere trade negotiations, most importantly with </p><p>the EU.  WTO negotiations also remain with Hugueney, whose </p><p>Economic Department houses the technical trade offices that </p><p>conduct both the WTO and FTAA negotiations. </p><p>6. According to Ambassador Leao, the Economic Department may </p><p>also experience some lesser changes.  For instance, under </p><p>consideration is the placement of the office responsible for </p><p>trade disputes, which currently reports directly to Hugueney, </p><p>under the Economic Department.  In addition, Leao\'s Division </p><p>of Intellectual Property and New Themes might move to the </p><p>Department for Scientific and Technical Cooperation, an </p><p>existing department within Hugueney\'s Under Secretariat, </p><p>which might also, at least temporarily, absorb the current </p><p>Department for Commercial Promotion. </p><p> </p><p>The New Trade Team </p><p> </p><p>7. Ambassador Simas, who spent time in Geneva with Foreign </p><p>Minister Amorim, told us on January 22 that he plans to focus </p><p>more on the substance of FTAA negotiations than on Co-Chair </p><p>issues.  He will also now assume the position as head of </p><p>Brazil\'s FTAA delegation, opposite AUSTR Regina Vargo, as </p><p>Hugueney assumes a Co-Chair position alongside DUSTR </p><p>Allgeier.  Although Ambassador Simas did not have direct </p><p>responsibility for FTAA issues in his former position as the </p><p>President\'s Special Mercosul Representative, he followed FTAA </p><p>issues since Mercosul has been negotiating as a block. </p><p>Working for him on Co-Chair issues as the new head of the </p><p>COALCA office is Tovar da Silva Nunes, chief of staff for the </p><p>former Minister of MDIC, Ambassador Sergio Amaral.  The </p><p>COALCA position was made vacant with the promotion of Antonio </p><p>Simoes to Minister Amorim\'s cabinet as Economic Advisor </p><p>immediately following the Foreign Minister\'s inauguration. </p><p>Da Silva Nunes is well connected politically, having served </p><p>in positions supporting his successful mentor Ambassador </p><p>Amaral for the past decade, and with the private sector from </p><p>his stint at MDIC.  Simas is reportedly going to draw from </p><p>staff in Geneva to fill the position as head of the Mercosul </p><p>trade negotiation division. </p><p> </p><p>8. As an additional note, Maria Nazareth Farani Azevedo, who </p><p>was tapped to work as an advisor to Foreign Minister Amorim </p><p>on Political and Multilateral Affairs, will be replaced as </p><p>head of the Market Access Division in the Economic Department </p><p>by Luis Antonio Balduino, who is transferring from an </p><p>assignment in the World Bank. </p><p> </p><p>9. Comment:   The new government is moving quickly to </p><p>establish the institutional structures that will better </p><p>enable it to act on its clearly stated political and economic </p><p>priority of regional integration.  Despite some lingering </p><p>skepticism among the public and within official circles </p><p>regarding initiatives to "once again" reinvigorate Mercosul, </p><p>the seriousness with which this administration is moving in </p><p>accord with this aim is striking.  Ambassador Leao expressed </p><p>surprise at the level of commitment within the new government </p><p>and described the ministry\'s reorganization as indicative of </p><p>a "watershed" in GOB policy concerning Mercosul. </p><p> </p><p>10. Despite a clear emphasis being placed on Mercosul and </p><p>wider regional integration, the importance of FTAA </p><p>negotiations does not appear to have diminished for the GOB </p><p>as demonstrated by actions to refocus and strengthen </p><p>Hugueney\'s Under Secretariat for Economic and Trade Affairs. </p><p>Post would expect the retention of FTAA and WTO negotiating </p><p>responsibilities under the direction of Hugueney to portend </p><p>not only continuity of GOB positions but also of the overall </p><p>commitment of the GOB to these negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>11. Ambassador Hugueney, who cut his trade teeth during the </p><p>Tokyo Round, enjoys exceptional credibility within the new </p><p>government and is well respected within international trade </p><p>circles.  He has been a reasonable and responsive </p><p>interlocutor with the Mission and other USG officials.  With </p><p>a trimmed down Under Secretariat, Hugueney should be able to </p><p>focus more attention on the FTAA and WTO negotiations. </p><p>According to Itamaraty staff, Hugueney has successfully lined </p><p>up experienced trade officials/negotiators that he can </p><p>increasingly rely on as the FTAA and WTO negotiations enter </p><p>more intensive phases. </p><p>VIRDEN </p><p></p></div>
