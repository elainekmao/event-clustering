<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002451 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/25/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, KPKO, SL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MINISTER OF DEFENSE ON UNAMSIL ROTATIONS, </p><p>505 AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 143583 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2117 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 2289 </p><p>     D. STATE 151930 </p><p>     E. ABUJA 2218 </p><p>     F. ABUJA NI 228 </p><p>     G. STATE 141654 </p><p>     H. ABUJA 2448 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews; Reasons 1.5 (b/d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) CDA Andrews, accompanied by DATT, called on Minister </p><p>of Defense Danjuma 25 September.  After the Minister offered </p><p>his personal condolences on the attacks against the U.S., and </p><p>CDA offered his condolences for the victims of the Jos riot, </p><p>he raised the USG request that Nigeria adjust its troop </p><p>rotations for UNAMSIL (Refs A-F).  Danjuma stated that when </p><p>he returned from his vacation, he was told of the meeting </p><p>between Ambassador Jeter and the President and informed that </p><p>the President had agreed to keep one battalion in Sierra </p><p>Leone until January.  However, Danjuma explained, the MOD had </p><p>reviewed this and the subsequent request (that Nigeria not </p><p>replace one battalion leaving Sierra Leone in September), and </p><p>had determined that the MOU between Nigeria and the UN that </p><p>governs Nigeria\'s participation in UNAMSIL did not permit the </p><p>GON to meet the U.S. request.  He added that he had briefed </p><p>the President on his analysis, and the President had agreed </p><p>that Nigeria could not make the change without UN consent. </p><p>The President had agreed to send a letter to the Ambassador </p><p>explaining this position, and Danjuma provided a copy of the </p><p>letter. (Text of the letter to Ambassador Jeter, which </p><p>Embassy has yet to receive in original, is at para. 7.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) If UNDPKO approached the GON and made the request, </p><p>would the GON reconsider, Andrews asked?  Danjuma replied </p><p>that Nigeria had already begun to rotate troops, and that </p><p>some had been airborne (over the Ivory Coast) when told to </p><p>return (following our initial requests).  Danjuma said, "The </p><p>troops have been at the two airports ready to go for two </p><p>weeks.  I would not want to face them.  I would not want to </p><p>explain to them the kind of game we\'re playing."  When </p><p>Andrews asked the timing of the planned September rotations, </p><p>Danjuma was unsure, explaining that that information was with </p><p>the Chief of Defense Staff.  (DATT COMMENT:  65 Battalion </p><p>rotation began on 17 September but was summarily cancelled </p><p>and troops called back.  The cancellation does not support a </p><p>Nigeria/UN agreement either, since rotating units after one </p><p>year is a general policy.  END DATT COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Turning to OFR P3, Andrews explained that the 505 </p><p>Agreement between the U.S. and Nigeria signed in September </p><p>2000 would have to be amended to cover some equipment being </p><p>transferred in Phase 3 (Ref. H).  Andrews explained that the </p><p>MFA had forwarded the Embassy\'s Note and the proposed </p><p>response to the Minister\'s office for approval, which was </p><p>required urgently.  Danjuma said he had not seen the </p><p>documents.  (COMMENT:  CDA provided the Minister with another </p><p>copy.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Andrews then told Danjuma that he had been to see the </p><p>Air Force Minister, Dan Chuke, to request a blanket clearance </p><p>for medical evacuation in light of OFR P3. (Ref G).  Danjuma </p><p>was unsure if even he could approve such a request, let alone </p><p>the Air Force, and opined that the request might have to be </p><p>forwarded to the Presidency for a decision. (DATT COMMENT: </p><p>MOD was the next stop after seeing Air Force Operations and </p><p>the Air Force Minister.  END DATT COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Finally, Andrews noted that former PDAS-D McConnell </p><p>was planning a trip to Nigeria soon, and that OFR and MPRI </p><p>FY02 would be on his agenda.  Andrews noted that Nigeria </p><p>still had not paid the outstanding $320K for MPRI FY01. </p><p>Danjuma seemed mildly surprised that the outstanding payment </p><p>remained an issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: Its seems clear that MOD and DHQ have driven </p><p>the reversal of the President\'s decision to support the </p><p>initial USG request.  Nigerian soldiers are poorly paid, and </p><p>UN PKO deployments mean equipment and additional salary.  The </p><p>Minister\'s concerns about informing expectant soldiers that </p><p>they will not deploy and will not receive additional income </p><p>are unfortunate but understandable.  It is unlikely that the </p><p>GON would reconsider this position, or would have the ability </p><p>to reconsider it (due to bureaucratic inertia) in time before </p><p>rotations occur.  The two battalions rotating in (73 and 65) </p><p>are the units that were originally scheduled for training in </p><p>OFR P1 but were replaced because of logistical/basing issues. </p><p> With these two Nigerian battalions rotating in now, there </p><p>may be room under the UNAMSIL troop ceiling for only two of </p><p>the three Nigerian battalions being trained in OFR P3.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21 September 2001 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UNAMSIL TROOP DEPLOYMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I write in respect of your meeting with President Olusegun </p><p>Obasanjo on 24 August, 2001 during which you conveyed a </p><p>proposal from your Government concerning the rotation of </p><p>Nigerian battalions participating in the United Nations </p><p>Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL).  On that occasion, as </p><p>might be recalled, the President was positively disposed to </p><p>the US suggestion that one of the Nigerian battalions </p><p>expected to be rotated out in September be kept until January </p><p>2002.  A further request was subsequently made on behalf of </p><p>your Government that the Nigerian battalion to be rotated out </p><p>of Sierra Leone should not be replaced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I am to inform you however the His Excellency\'s attention has </p><p>been drawn to the fact that Nigeria\'s participation in </p><p>UNAMSIL is governed by conditions spelt out in the Memorandum </p><p>of Understanding (MOU) signed between it and the United </p><p>Nations (UN).  This agreement requires certain steps be taken </p><p>before a contributing country can increase or decrease its </p><p>troop size in UNAMSIL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It will therefore be understood that it will not be proper at </p><p>this stage for Nigeria to change the composition of its </p><p>forces in UNAMSIL, as this will amount to unilateral </p><p>abrogation of the MOU.  accordingly, it has been decided that </p><p>the rotation of Nigerian battalions in UNAMSIL should proceed </p><p>along the lines earlier arranged with the UN and it is hoped </p><p>that you will appreciate the difficulty in acceding to the </p><p>request of the US Government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Please accept the assurances of my highest consideration and </p><p>personal esteem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>/sgd/ </p><p>Ambassador A.O. Esan, </p><p>Ag. Chief of Staff to the President, C-In-C </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>cc: </p><p>Honorable Minister of Defense </p><p>Honorable Minister of Foreign Affairs </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End Text </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Freetown minimize considered. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
