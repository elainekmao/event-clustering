<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 NASSAU 000925 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, BF, PGOV, CARICOM, China </p><p>SUBJECT: ARTICLE 98 -- A NON-ISSUE FOR CARICOM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT M. WITAJEWSKI </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  Bahamian Ambassador to CARICOM Archer infers that CARICOM </p><p>will not support Article 98 and clears post confusion based </p><p>on mixed signals from the Prime Minster (positive) and the </p><p>Foreign Ministry (negative).  In relation to Cuba, he states </p><p>that CARICOM will not support discussion on the country in </p><p>the OAS forum where Cuba is unable to defend itself.  End </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Article 98: Dead in the Water? </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Deputy Chief of Mission, accompanied by Econ/Comm </p><p>officer, met May 13 with Leonard Archer, Bahamian ambassador </p><p>to CARICOM and the senior Foreign Ministry official who </p><p>accompanied Foreign Minister Fred Mitchell to the May 8-9, </p><p>2003, CARICOM Foreign Ministers meeting held in Kingstown, </p><p>St. Vincent. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  DCM had requested the meeting earlier in the week in </p><p>order to obtain clarification and the Bahamian interpretation </p><p>of the CARICOM communiqus dealing with Article 98 and Cuba. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Ambassador Archer was candid.  In response to DCM,s </p><p>request for clarification of CARICOM\'s stance, he stated </p><p>categorically that the fifteen CARICOM member states were </p><p>agreed that they could not sign an Article 98 bilateral </p><p>agreement with the United States because to do so "would </p><p>negate the Rome Treaty" establishing the International </p><p>Criminal Court.  He reminded the Embassy that the CARICOM </p><p>member-states had been "instrumental in initiating and </p><p>resuscitating" the concept of the international criminal </p><p>court. Ambassador Archer insisted that the CARICOM members </p><p>felt that to sign an Article 98 agreement with the United </p><p>States now would "neutralize or neuter" the Rome Treaty. </p><p>"The (Rome) Treaty and an Article 98 agreement simply can,t </p><p>legally co-exist in our opinion," he insisted. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Asked what the particular position of The Bahamas was </p><p>in light of the revised, customized texts of a proposed </p><p>Article 98 agreement that had been provided to the GCOB, </p><p>Ambassador Archer responded that the "many different </p><p>versions" of a draft agreement that the United States had </p><p>been circulating had been itself a cause of concern within </p><p>CARICOM  The fact that the United States was circulating "so </p><p>many" different drafts to different countries, rather than </p><p>one single text was, to him and his colleagues, Archer </p><p>insisted,  "proof that something was fundamentally wrong with </p><p>(this) approach."  Reminded that the United States had indeed </p><p>initially proposed one single text and had modified it -- </p><p>reluctantly -- in response to the desires expressed by </p><p>individual countries for a text that addressed their </p><p>particular circumstances, Ambassador Archer had no response. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Asked about next steps, Ambassador Archer said that </p><p>while CARICOM will keep the issue "under review" and was </p><p>"open to discussion"  he saw little, if any possibility of </p><p>any movement.  CARICOM he stated categorically, would not </p><p>itself propose a revised, acceptable single draft Article 98 </p><p>text to the United States.   Asked if this meant the ball was </p><p>in the United States, court to propose a new draft, Archer </p><p>responded that while the United States could do so, "it was a </p><p>very big if that CARICOM would respond...  in any event." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cuba and Natural Justice </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Turning to the communiqu on Cuba that the CARICOM </p><p>foreign ministers had also issued, Ambassador Archer said </p><p>that it was the "unanimous" view of the CARICOM membership </p><p>that seeking to pass a resolution condemning Cuba in the OAS </p><p>when Cuba was not permitted to defend itself as a member </p><p>"violated the rule of natural justice."  Pressed if this was </p><p>really a unanimous view or simply a strongly-held position by </p><p>some member-states, Archer responded that "no one in the room </p><p>objected to the communiqu\'s wording." </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  At the end of the conversation, and following an </p><p>extended exchange with DCM on the Castro dictatorship and its </p><p>historical record of human rights and other violations, </p><p>Ambassador Archer closed the conversation by telling DCM that </p><p>"it was illogical" for the United States to continually try </p><p>to obtain resolutions condemning Cuba since "the United </p><p>States also had blood on its hands there," criticized the </p><p>influence of Cuban-American and Cuban exile groups in </p><p>Florida, and insisted that it was unlikely that the United </p><p>States would ever obtain a sympathetic hearing from CARICOM </p><p>members until it altered "its irrational Cuba policy." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  In contrast to other members of the Bahamian Foreign </p><p>Ministry, Ambassador Archer was refreshingly candid and </p><p>forthcoming in explaining the GCOB position within CARICOM on </p><p>these issues -- even if the news he delivered was unpleasant </p><p>and tinged with outdated ideology.  On Article 98, Archer </p><p>confirmed the view that the Foreign Minister and the Foreign </p><p>Ministry have no political desire, or ideological </p><p>inclination, to conclude an Article 98 agreement and are </p><p>pleased to hide behind CARICOM solidarity on this issue. </p><p>Further reinforcing their position is the fact that the </p><p>Foreign Ministry officials are also well aware that unless </p><p>and until they ratify the International Criminal Court </p><p>treaty, they can free ride on this since there will be no </p><p>consequences to opposing the U.S.  When Ambassador Archer was </p><p>asked if there was any timetable to submit the treaty to </p><p>parliament for ratification, an act that would trigger </p><p>sanctions, Archer coyly responded that he "wasn\'t aware of </p><p>any plans to do so."  Since the Prime Minister has been much </p><p>more positive on this isse than the Foreign Minister, the </p><p>only possiblity we see for an Article 98 agreement is if the </p><p>PM overrules Foreign Minister Mitchell and gives him a direct </p><p>order.  We have seen nothing in PM Christie\'s governing style </p><p>and personality to indicate that this is likely. 8 </p><p>BLANKENSHIP </p><p></p></div>
