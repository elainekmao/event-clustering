<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003347 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/20/2017 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MODERATE MUSLIM SENATOR TO CONTEST </p><p>ZAMFARA GOVERNORSHIP </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Ambassador Jeter met December 16 with Senator Lawal </p><p>Shuaibu who represents Zamfara State and is ANPP Whip in the </p><p>Senate. RNLEO was notetaker.  Shuaibu is known to the Embassy </p><p>for his past Chairmanship of the Senate Drugs and Financial </p><p>Crimes Committee. He recently declared his formal candidacy </p><p>for the Governorship of Zamfara on the ANPP ticket. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) The Ambassador applauded the efforts of Shuaibu and </p><p>other members of the Senate instrumental in approving the </p><p>three pieces of anti-money laundering legislation prior to </p><p>the December 15 deadline imposed by the Financial Action Task </p><p>Force.  Shuaibu explained the last minute changes made by the </p><p>Senate -- changes that weakened the Money Laundering Act </p><p>Amendment considerably -- were the result of a few Senators </p><p>who put their personal interests ahead of national interests </p><p>and were afraid that the bill\'s requirements could somehow be </p><p>used against them politically by the President.  The </p><p>Ambassador praised the Senate\'s commitment to meeting in </p><p>emergency session to restore the amendment to its earlier, </p><p>stronger version in time for the President to sign it and the </p><p>other two bills into Law on December 14. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) After expressing condolences over the recent loss of </p><p>Senator Idris Abubakar (Gombe State) who passed away December </p><p>11 in a London hospital, the Ambassador asked Shuaibu for a </p><p>readout on his political plans.  Shuaibu noted that he has </p><p>begun an aggressive campaign to unseat Governor Sani, whom he </p><p>views as "incompetent, corrupt and dangerous."  Claiming that </p><p>it is an "open secret" that Sani pockets much of the federal </p><p>funds received by Zamfara State and earmarked for Local </p><p>Government Areas (LGAs) for public works projects, Shuaibu </p><p>characterized the Governor as "the biggest thief in Zamfara." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Sani\'s professed allegiance to Sharia is a farce, noted </p><p>Shuaibu, who claimed that Sani personally does not practice </p><p>Sharia even in Zamfara.  Sani is widely known to have </p><p>girlfriends in Abuja whom he visits frequently and one in </p><p>London who draws him abroad whenever possible.  The </p><p>imposition of Sharia rule in Zamfara, now three years old, </p><p>has not improved the law and order situation in the state. </p><p>Instead, the crime rate is increasing, with daytime robberies </p><p>occurring brazenly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Shuaibu also expressed concern that Sani is courting </p><p>indigenous and foreign Islamic extremists.  Hezbah, a group </p><p>of Islamic fundamentalists based in northern Nigeria, has </p><p>been funded and encouraged by Sani, according to Shuaibu. </p><p>(Note: The Hezbah form Sharia Compliance Squads in some </p><p>states, including Zamfara, where they are given </p><p>quasi-official status.  According to some accounts, Hezbah </p><p>activists instigated the November 22 riot in Abuja, emanating </p><p>from the Friday afternoons prayers in Abuja\'s National </p><p>Mosque.  End Note) Sani also reportedly met recently with </p><p>Saudi fundamentalist in the Saudi town of "Daman," which the </p><p>Senator described as a "volatile area" of the Islamic </p><p>Kingdom.   Shuaibu opined that Nigeria\'s State Security </p><p>Service should investigate Sani\'s foreign extremist ties. </p><p>Allegations also continue to surface that Sani is accepting </p><p>money from fundamestalist Arab sources, asserted Shuaibu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) Shuaibu hoped that the Federal Government will </p><p>disqualify Sani as a gubernatorial candidate, based on Sani\'s </p><p>alleged corruption.  The Independent Corrupt Practices and </p><p>Other Related Offenses Commission (ICPC) and the State </p><p>Security Service (SSS) are charged with providing to the </p><p>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) dossiers on </p><p>electoral candidates who are not fit to hold office because </p><p>of their corruption of criminal behavior. Shuaibu is lobbying </p><p>the President\'s office to have these agencies submit a report </p><p>to INEC declaring Sani unfit to contest the Governorship a </p><p>second time.  Shuaibu also claimed that National Security </p><p>Advisor Aliyu Mohammed, a native of Zamfara, backed his </p><p>efforts to unseat Sani "100 percent," although Shuaibu and </p><p>Mohammed are in different parties.  Shuaibu appealed to the </p><p>Ambassador to use his influence in supporting this effort, </p><p>calling on the Embassy to push for Sani\'s disqualification </p><p>with INEC.  The Ambassador did not offer this support but </p><p>pledge to keep an "ear to the ground," particularly within </p><p>the Presidential camp, on developments surrounding the </p><p>Zamfara gubernatorial race. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Comment:  Governor Sani is known for introducing </p><p>"political" Sharia to northern Nigeria; during his tenure, </p><p>Zamfara was the first state to expand the application of </p><p>Sharia law to cover criminal matters.  Sani\'s critics claim </p><p>he is not a devout Muslim and has played the Sharia card to </p><p>bolster his political standing. His politicization of </p><p>religion has shown through other rash acts such as his late </p><p>2001 declaration of "jihad" against Muslims in the PDP whom </p><p>he felt were trying to impeach him.  Most recently, his </p><p>Deputy Governor -- who many believe was acting on Sani\'s </p><p>instructions -- declared a "fatwa" against a journalist of </p><p>"This Day" -- the Nigerian daily newspaper that published the </p><p>remark perceived as blasphemy against Islam.  While Shuaibu\'s </p><p>attacks on Sani are in part politically motivated, Shuaibu, </p><p>in contrast to Sani, is a moderate with a good track record </p><p>of chairing Senate Committees and working well with the </p><p>Executive branch (despite being from a different party).  He </p><p>is well disposed to the U.S. and has broad support from </p><p>influential political figures.  His victory in the </p><p>gubernatorial race in Zamfara could help moderate religious </p><p>politics in Northern Nigeria. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
