<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001556 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, PGOV, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT:  TRAINING CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN NORTHERN VIETNAM </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  Hanoi 073   B.  HO CHI MINH 468 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  Hanoi\'s Catholic seminary offers training </p><p>to over 200 would-be priests over a seven year period. </p><p>Local Committees on Religious Affairs screen out some </p><p>candidates, allegedly on grounds of "personal conduct." </p><p>Virtually all graduates become priests; a small percentage </p><p>is able to continue religious training overseas.  No foreign </p><p>professors are allowed.  The Church seeks to open another </p><p>seminary in the north, in Thai Binh province, but remains </p><p>hampered by a long-standing impasse on opening a seventh </p><p>seminary, in southern Dong Nai province. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The spacious grounds of the downtown Hanoi Catholic </p><p>Cathedral house one of Vietnam\'s six Catholic seminaries to </p><p>train the next generation of priests.  Occupying both a </p><p>century-old building constructed as a seminary during the </p><p>French colonial era and a more recent adjacent structure, </p><p>the seminary (now on summer recess) provides a six-year </p><p>training program for priests from 8 northern dioceses.  New </p><p>students are admitted every other year; entrance tests for </p><p>the new cycle beginning in 2004 will be given in September </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  212 students are currently enrolled in the </p><p>seminary, although no more than about 170 are in Hanoi </p><p>during the school year, given the requirement for a 9-12 </p><p>month work practicum after the six years of classroom </p><p>training.  (Students are also expected to intern at their </p><p>home churches during the summer holidays.)  The Hanoi </p><p>seminary is second in size only to the Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>seminary. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  According to Ngo Quang Kiet, concurrently Hanoi </p><p>Seminary Director, Hanoi Apostolic Administrator, and Bishop </p><p>of Lang Son (ref a), numbers of students have increased </p><p>substantially from 1978, when the seminary re-opened after </p><p>an 18 year gap in training.  Only nine students were in the </p><p>first class, he recalled, but the 2002 class has 55 would-be </p><p>priests.  He admitted that the local Committees on Religious </p><p>Affairs have an important role in the screening process; for </p><p>the 2002 class, various Committees (apparently at the </p><p>provincial level) screened out 15 individuals, mostly for </p><p>"personal conduct" issues.  He stressed that family </p><p>background or "political" stances were not/not a factor. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Would-be students must first be recommended by </p><p>local priests, and then pass a standard day-long test, </p><p>mostly dealing with religious knowledge and expertise in </p><p>either English or French.  Virtually all students have </p><p>completed a four year undergraduate university degree </p><p>program; 2/3 of them typically have majored in foreign </p><p>language (with the bulk of them having studied English </p><p>rather than French).  The usual maximum age for entry is 30. </p><p>After the recommendations and successful tests comes the </p><p>scrutiny by the local Committees on Religious Affairs, which </p><p>also assess the students for suitability upon graduation, </p><p>according to Bishop Kiet. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  About ninety percent of all graduates become </p><p>priests (and virtually all return to their home diocese), </p><p>but Bishop Kiet declined to describe whether the other 10 </p><p>percent fail academically or are ruled out by local </p><p>authorities.  No more than 5 percent of the graduates are </p><p>able to gain scholarships for foreign study, mostly in the </p><p>Philippines, Italy, and France.  None from the north have </p><p>gone to the U.S. for study, due to a lack of available </p><p>scholarships, but Bishop Kiet confirmed that some U.S. </p><p>scholarships exist for seminary graduates in the south. </p><p>Essentially all students come from Catholic families, he </p><p>noted; he could not recall any case of a convert entering </p><p>the seminary.  Nor could he recall any student ever having </p><p>been a member of the Communist Party of Vietnam.  Unlike </p><p>universities and other secondary and tertiary schools in </p><p>Vietnam, there is no chapter of the Ho Chi Minh Youth </p><p>Federation at the seminary, he added. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  23 religious teachers conduct the classes, all of </p><p>which are mandatory, including one new course on bioethics </p><p>as well as standard classes on church law, music, and </p><p>psychology.  There are no courses yet offered on management. </p><p>(Computers are available for common use, and there is </p><p>optional training on computer use.)  Only three professor- </p><p>priests are resident here, however; Bishop Kiet said that </p><p>the other 20 rotate among the various other Catholic </p><p>seminaries, giving a month\'s course here, a month\'s course </p><p>there.  A cadre from the Ministry of Education also conducts </p><p>a four-year required course on "civil education."  Bishop </p><p>Kiet admitted that Ho Chi Minh thought and Marxist/Leninist </p><p>ideology are a component of this course, but stressed "only </p><p>a little."  Most of the course is devoted to Vietnamese </p><p>culture and law, he claimed. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  No foreign professors teach at the seminary, </p><p>Bishop Kiet confirmed.  He said that the Church had </p><p>requested permission from the Government Committee on </p><p>Religious Affairs "about ten years" ago to bring in a </p><p>foreign professor, but this was denied.  The Church has not </p><p>asked a second time, he claimed, while expressing a hope </p><p>that a foreign professor would be allowed within this </p><p>decade. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Bishop Kiet recalled that, during the French era, </p><p>there were several other Catholic seminaries serving the </p><p>north, such as in Hatay and Ha Nam provinces.  The Church </p><p>has requested permission from the Government Committee on </p><p>Religious Affairs for another northern seminary, to be </p><p>located in Thai Binh (where there is a suitable site </p><p>available, he noted), but Committee officials have indicated </p><p>that no additional seminary could be considered until the </p><p>long-standing impasse over opening the seventh Catholic </p><p>seminary (in southern Dong Nai province, where many of the </p><p>northern Catholics resettled in 1954) was resolved.  Bishop </p><p>Kiet expressed frank puzzlement about the exact nature of </p><p>the problem in Dong Nai, admitting that the Government </p><p>Committee on Religious Affairs had clearly approved its </p><p>establishment "in principle" several years ago. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Bishop Kiet assessed that the biggest change at </p><p>the Seminary over the past two decades had been a higher </p><p>quality of students and the greater international exposure </p><p>of the student body.  He expressed a hope for continued </p><p>expansion of the student body here, as well as the opening </p><p>of the seminary in Thai Binh soon, in order to meet the </p><p>chronic shortage of priests. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Comment:  Catholics in Vietnam have arguably </p><p>easier relations with the GVN than their Protestant </p><p>colleagues, but face the same kind of official scrutiny and </p><p>oversight even the Buddhists encounter as they seek to train </p><p>clergy.  Apart from the civic education, the GVN appears to </p><p>leave the Catholics pretty much to their own devices in </p><p>undertaking their curriculum.  Resources appear to be modest </p><p>and the facilities basic (if once beautiful) in Hanoi.  The </p><p>dedication of the leaders of the northern seminary is </p><p>unmistakable, as was their apparent discomfort in describing </p><p>their relations with the various Committees on Religious </p><p>Affairs -- even in the absence of any GVN minders. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
