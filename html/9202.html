(U) The Advisory Body on Administrative and Financial </p><p>Matters (ABAF) of the Organization for the Prohibition of </p><p>Chemical Weapons (OPCW) held its 14th session in The Hague, </p><p>from 9-13 June 2003. The primary focus of attention was on </p><p>the draft programme and budget 2004, which calls for an 8.36 </p><p>percent increase in budget level and a 9.0 percent increase </p><p>in assessments to Member States. The ABAF noted the lack of </p><p>justification or explanation in the text of the document for </p><p>major increases and decreases proposed in the budget </p><p>estimates and took exception to a number of proposals. Other </p><p>items on the agenda also receiving active consideration were </p><p>the progress report on the recommendations by the 13 session </p><p>of the ABAF, the report on status of income and expenditure </p><p>in implementation of the OPCW 2003 programme and budget of 30 </p><p>April 2003, and the audited financial statements and the </p><p>report of the External Auditor. Some items on the agenda were </p><p>not considered due to the unavailability of documentation </p><p>and/or a shortage of time.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>ATTENDANCE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.    (SBU)  Attendance at this session of the ABAF was </p><p>rather poor. In addition to the Chairman, Farajvand (Iran), </p><p>there were only six other members in fairly regular </p><p>attendance: Brasack (Germany), Fox (USA), Iossifov (Russian </p><p>Federation), Komuro (Japan), Malpaga (Italy), and </p><p>Poornalingam (India). Three others, who attended more </p><p>irregularly, perhaps due to budget consultations with Member </p><p>States being conducted at the same time, were Suarez </p><p>(Mexico), Lee (Korea) and Kamron (Pakistan).  Kamron </p><p>apparently was attending without formal notification of his </p><p>membership to the Executive Council and thus his he will not </p><p>be named as an attendee in the report on the session. Those </p><p>members with apparent budgetary experience appeared to be </p><p>Poornalingam, Fox, Kamron, and perhaps Iossifov. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>OPENING STATEMENT BY </p><p> THE DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.    (U) The DG attended the opening of the session and </p><p>delivered a statement indicating his personal endorsement of </p><p>the proposed programme and budget for 2004. He noted his </p><p>commitment to transparency and his intention to move to </p><p>results-based budgeting (RBB) for 2005 as a means to improve </p><p>to improve management and to provide better measurement of </p><p>resources in terms of results produced. Other points he made </p><p>include: </p><p> </p><p>-     The proposed increase of 8.36 percent includes 2.92 </p><p>percent (EUR 2 million) for staff turnover largely due to the </p><p>decision on tenure policy, which means the increase is only </p><p>5.44 percent without the provision for staff turnover. </p><p>-     The large increase in official travel (128 percent) </p><p>reflects the requirements for full performance of the </p><p>organization\'s work as well as the DG\'s belief that he must </p><p>make visits to Member States to encourage more observance of </p><p>the Convention and he also needs to make efforts toward the </p><p>goal of universality of the Convention. </p><p>-     The increase in consultants (94 percent) is because </p><p>this is a less expensive way to provide skills and expertise </p><p>not available within the Secretariat and it also could help </p><p>to improve geographical balance within the organization. </p><p>-     The Member States need to assist the DG is providing </p><p>the necessary leadership for the organization by giving him </p><p>more authority for reclassifying and transferring posts. </p><p>-     This is a barebones budget and reductions would have </p><p>serious impact on OPCW effectiveness. </p><p>4.    (U) The DG also hosted a luncheon for members of the </p><p>ABAF on the opening day. The key topic at the luncheon was </p><p>the possible use of "on call" Inspectors. The DG stressed </p><p>this would be a way to reduce the cost of Inspectors, since </p><p>they would not receive the benefits paid for regular </p><p>Inspectors, and the use only of retired Inspectors would </p><p>assure the quality of those selected. Furthermore, the "on </p><p>call" Inspectors would be used only for destruction, which </p><p>would avoid confidentiality problems regarding industry </p><p>inspections. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>REVIEW OF PROGRESS ON </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 13TH ABAF </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.    (U) The key issue was the failure this year to </p><p>implement the recommendation in the report of the 13th ABAF </p><p>that actual expenditures for the previous year should be </p><p>provided to serve as a point of reference for considering </p><p>proposed budget levels. The Indian and U.S. members expressed </p><p>the most concern about this matter. The Secretariat indicated </p><p>they were reluctant to provide information on 2002 actual </p><p>expenditures because of the irregular budgetary situation in </p><p>2002. Nevertheless, in response to an ABAF request, the </p><p>Secretariat belatedly provided a listing of 2002 actual </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>expenditures by programme and assured ABAF that previous year </p><p>actual expenditures would be included in the 2005 budget </p><p>proposals. The ABAF took official notice of this assurance by </p><p>the Secretariat. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>2003 BUDGET STATUS REPORT </p><p>AS OF 30 APRIL 2003 </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.    (U) The Russian member, especially, took issue with the </p><p>heading "Revised Budget" for column 5 of Annex 6 (Expenditure </p><p>by programme as 30 April 2003). He and other members </p><p>questioned the implication of this heading that the </p><p>Secretariat had the authority to officially revise the budget </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>that had been approved by Member States. The Director of </p><p>Administration indicated that, in accord with Financial </p><p>Regulation 4.7, the Secretariat is obligated to manage </p><p>expenditures in view of funds available, which meant they had </p><p>to take into account the historical pattern of a shortfall in </p><p>contributions (as well as transfers to Programme 3 - </p><p>International Cooperation and Assistance required by a policy </p><p>decision). ABAF commended the Secretariat for observing </p><p>Financial Regulation 4.7, but recommended that column 3, </p><p>"Anticipated Shortfall", should be deleted and the heading </p><p>for column 5 should be changed from "Revised Budget" to </p><p>"Allotment". </p><p> </p><p>7.    (U) Regarding Annex 7 (Expenditure by Category as of 30 </p><p>April 2003), the U.S. and Indian members pointed out that the </p><p>main objects of expenditures listed reflected more activities </p><p>than usual objects of expenditures. The Secretariat explained </p><p>that previous efforts to revise the objects of expenditure </p><p>had been resisted by some Member States. Nevertheless, ABAF </p><p>recommended that the Secretariat should revise the objects of </p><p>expenditure in accordance with the practices followed in the </p><p>UN common system. </p><p> </p><p>8.    (SBU) Regarding Annexes 4 and 5 (concerning </p><p>reimbursement of verification costs under Articles IV and V </p><p>of the Convention), the ABAF was concerned to see the levels </p><p>of outstanding balances of reimbursement payments. The ABAF </p><p>noted the claim of the Secretariat that it had substantially </p><p>improved the system of invoicing for such reimbursements (a </p><p>claim that may have been overstated), but reiterated the need </p><p>for the Secretariat to further improve the process of </p><p>invoicing. Director of Administration Schulz indicated his </p><p>understanding of the need to adjust the invoicing process to </p><p>the different requirements of the possessor states, and his </p><p>intention to make efforts toward doing so. In view of the low </p><p>percentage of payments of the verification reimbursements, </p><p>the Italian member, especially, wanted the ABAF to recommend </p><p>that the possessor states should expedite their payments. </p><p>After some discussion of the propriety of the ABAF making </p><p>recommendations directly to Member States on how to manage </p><p>their affairs, the Italian member agreed to have the ABAF </p><p>just stress the need for expeditious payments by Member </p><p>States. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS </p><p>AND REPORT OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.    (U) In response to a recommendation last year by the </p><p>ABAF, a representative of the External Auditor presented the </p><p>report of the External Auditor on the financial statements of </p><p>the organization for 2002. This was appreciated by the ABAF </p><p>and it was recommended that this practice be continued in the </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p>10.   (U) Among the points raised in considering this item, </p><p>the ABAF expressed concern over the delay and the alarming </p><p>increase in costs for implementation of the Smartstream </p><p>project. The Secretariat acknowledged serious problems in </p><p>implementing this project and indicated that the original </p><p>assumptions on which it was based were entirely unrealistic. </p><p>ABAF thought it was time for an objective review of the </p><p>project and thus recommended a critical evaluation by an </p><p>external expert of the financial and human resources required </p><p>for the project. </p><p> </p><p>11.   (U) Another issue under this item concerned the very </p><p>low rate of expenditure (often zero) reported for the various </p><p>trust funds. While some members of ABAF wondered if this </p><p>meant that the need for the funds should be reconsidered, it </p><p>was noted that at least some of the funds were just meant to </p><p>be available for use when needed rather than be used </p><p>continually. The ABAF ultimately just recommended that the </p><p>programme managers should take steps to utilize the funds </p><p>appropriately in accordance with the mandates for the funds. </p><p> </p><p>12.   (U) The report of the External Auditor (para. 16) says </p><p>that they "were informed that there were no frauds or losses </p><p>in 2002." When questioned by the U.S. member, in view of the </p><p>recent history of the organization, the representative of the </p><p>External Auditor reiterated the position taken in the report. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>DRAFT PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2004 </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.   (U) In terms of general observations, members of the </p><p>ABAF repeated their concern regarding the lack of information </p><p>about actual budget expenditures in the previous year. This </p><p>led to a recommendation formulated by the Indian member that </p><p>budgeted and actual figures for the previous full year should </p><p>be provided in all statements and that there should be </p><p>adequate explanations for sharp variations in the proposed </p><p>budget to provide the necessary basis for consideration of </p><p>budget proposals. (Having the two points in the same </p><p>recommendation is a bit confusing, but the recommendation </p><p>nevertheless is useful.) </p><p> </p><p>14.   (U) At the suggestion of the U.S. member, the ABAF </p><p>recommended that there should be a consolidated summary table </p><p>of the budget including all programmes and sub-programmes in </p><p>order to more easily consider all elements in context. </p><p> </p><p>15.   (U) In generally discussing the budget, the Secretariat </p><p>repeatedly indicated its intention to present the programme </p><p>and budget for 2005 in RBB format. Taking advantage of this, </p><p>the U.S. member got the ABAF to recommend that the use of the </p><p>RBB format should include presentation of an annual budget </p><p>implementation report that would contain (a) budgeted vs. </p><p>actual expenditures by programmes and sub-programmes, with a </p><p>brief explanation of major variances; (b) budgeted vs. actual </p><p>expenditures by object of expenditure, again with an </p><p>explanation of major variances; and (c) an indication of the </p><p>extent to which objectives and outputs had been achieved. </p><p> </p><p>16.    (U) Finally, in regard to the planned use of the RBB </p><p>format, ABAF members were concerned to learn what the </p><p>Secretariat had in mind and what changes may be required in </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the financial rules and regulations. The Secretariat </p><p>expressed great confidence in the preparatory work being done </p><p>by its consultants on RBB and thought no changes would be </p><p>required in the financial rules and regulations. </p><p>Nevertheless, the ABAF recommended that plans for use of this </p><p>format, including any changes required in the financial rules </p><p>and regulations, should be submitted by the Secretariat to </p><p>the ABAF at its 15th session. </p><p> </p><p>17.   (SBU) In reviewing the Executive Summary of the draft </p><p>programme and budget, the Russian member in particular </p><p>expressed concern about the proposed increase. Thus, the ABAF </p><p>recalled the 9.95 percent increase in the budget for 2003 and </p><p>noted the additional substantial increase of 8.36 percent, </p><p>with a 9 percent increase in assessments, proposed for 2004. </p><p> </p><p>18.   (U) In regard to recosting, the ABAF noted that the </p><p>budget had been calculated on the basis of the historical </p><p>pattern of inflation and urged that the recosting calculation </p><p>be reconsidered before adoption by the Conference of States </p><p>Parties. This reflected the observation that inflation levels </p><p>now appear to be quite low. </p><p> </p><p>19.   (U) The ABAF regretted that the budget did not include </p><p>justification or explanation for the major increases and </p><p>decreases indicated in the budget tables of the different </p><p>programmes. While the Secretariat did sometimes provide oral </p><p>or written justifications for some items in response to ABAF </p><p>requests, there really was not time for critical review of </p><p>these belated justifications which meant that the substance </p><p>of the budget was not very rigorously examined by the ABAF, </p><p>as is indicated in the ABAF report. </p><p> </p><p>20.   (SBU) The ABAF noted the 94 percent increase proposed </p><p>for consultants and the fact that many of the Programme </p><p>Managers were unable to justify the need for consultants in </p><p>their programmes. As a result, the ABAF recommended that the </p><p>provision for consultants should be maintained at the 2003 </p><p>level, and that any increase for consultants beyond the 2003 </p><p>level should be matched by real savings -- this is in </p><p>recognition that the use of consultants could be a more </p><p>effective way to accomplish some objectives. The Korean </p><p>member insisted on including a dissenting view that got </p><p>expressed strangely as calling for further justification to </p><p>be provided to him. </p><p> </p><p>21.   (U) The ABAF noted that the proposed allocation for </p><p>official travel amounts to an increase of 128 percent. Rather </p><p>than recommending that travel be held to the 2003 level, ABAF </p><p>just noted that an increase of this amount requires a full </p><p>and careful justification, which was not presented in the </p><p>budget. The Secretariat orally expressed concern about the </p><p>need for more travel funds, but not much in the way of </p><p>details. </p><p> </p><p>22.   (U) There is some confusion in the budget and within </p><p>the Secretariat about the staffing levels for 2004. Paragraph </p><p>3 (a) in the Executive Summary (p. 7) states that four posts </p><p>will be re-activated in view of the needs of the Information </p><p>System Branch, the Office of the Legal Advisor and the Office </p><p>of Internal Oversight (two in ISB and one in each of the </p><p>others). As stated in paragraph 7 (p. 13), this means there </p><p>will be 478 positions funded in 2004 compared to 474 in 2003. </p><p>Nevertheless, the funded posts indicated in the sections for </p><p>each of the programmes add up to 481 posts, a net increase of </p><p>seven with a total of nine new or additional posts specified </p><p>that are offset by two posts identified for deletion. The </p><p>Director of Administration noted there were some mistakes in </p><p>the sections for the different programmes and he reaffirmed </p><p>that 478 is the correct number of funded positions proposed </p><p>for 2004. Nevertheless, some of the Programme Directors stood </p><p>by the staffing numbers in their sections, and some even </p><p>thought the requests in their sections were understated. </p><p>23.   Despite an increase of four funded positions, the </p><p>number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) will increase by ten, </p><p>from 460 in 2003 to 470 in 2004. This presumably reflects a </p><p>decreased lag factor for recruitment. </p><p> </p><p>24.   (U) ABAF members in general were troubled by the </p><p>Secretariat\'s repeated citing of the 507 approved posts and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the savings achieved by not filling all of them. The members </p><p>thought it would be more realistic and meaningful to write </p><p>off the level of 507 posts, since that level had not been </p><p>filled for years, and just agree that the number of approved </p><p>posts should be those posts approved for funding in each </p><p>annual budget. </p><p> </p><p>25.    (SBU) There was great concern expressed by some ABAF </p><p>members, the Russian and Italian in particular, about the </p><p>proposal in the budget (p. 16) that the Director General be </p><p>given authority to meet urgent operational requirements by </p><p>adjusting numbers in the staffing table provided that (a) he </p><p>does not exceed the total of 507 posts and (b) the total </p><p>appropriated for staff costs is not exceeded. This concern </p><p>reflected the contentious staffing practices of the DG\'s </p><p>predecessor. The DG had vigorously requested the need for </p><p>more flexibility in his management responsibilities and some </p><p>members were sympathetic to his request, at least within </p><p>limits. Therefore, rather than simply rejecting the proposal, </p><p>as some members would have liked, the ABAF developed a </p><p>recommendation to put some constraints on the proposed </p><p>flexibility, i.e., before taking such actions, the </p><p>Secretariat should present a full justification for the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>proposal, including reference to changes that may be required </p><p>in staff rules and regulations and to provisions that would </p><p>govern any re-classification of posts and transfer of posts </p><p>among programmes. </p><p> </p><p>26.   (U) Although not indicated in the ABAF report, members </p><p>did express concern about the 58 percent increase in medical </p><p>insurance costs. The Director of Administration indicated </p><p>that this increase results in large measure from the </p><p>occurrence of some bad illnesses among Secretariat members (a </p><p>point that needs further explanation.). He also indicated his </p><p>plan to have a consultant examine the organization\'s </p><p>insurance polices. </p><p> </p><p>27.   (U) There was much discussion among ABAF members of the </p><p>proposed level of EUR 3.9 million for Article IV and V </p><p>reimbursements, with many concerned that the proposed level </p><p>was too low and others concerned that a higher level would </p><p>just add to budgetary shortfalls for the organization. The </p><p>Director of Administration stressed that the problem was one </p><p>of late payment rather than non-payment and that he had in </p><p>mind a mechanism or process for dealing with this problem, </p><p>which would not require change in financial rules and </p><p>regulations. Rather than addressing the level of </p><p>reimbursements, the ABAF recommended that the Secretariat </p><p>submit the proposal indicated by the Director of </p><p>Administration for review by ABAF and the States Parties. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Programme 1 - Verification </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>28.   (SBU) Interesting points that came out in the </p><p>presentation of the Director for this Programme and follow-up </p><p>discussion included: </p><p> </p><p>-     The request for 70 staff members assumes the services </p><p>of an additional eight Inspectors on loan; the request would </p><p>have to be increased if those Inspectors were not available. </p><p>-     The Programme Director was unable to explain the need </p><p>for consultants for this programme, the request for which had </p><p>been inserted at the insistence of the DG. </p><p>-     The dramatic increase in official travel from EUR </p><p>12,000 in 2003 to EUR 52,000 on 2004 reflects significant </p><p>under funding in 2003. </p><p>-     The tenure of a majority of Verification Division staff </p><p>will expire at the end of May 2004, and there will have to be </p><p>an extension for some beyond the seven year limit in order to </p><p>assure the necessary continuity. </p><p>-     Inspectors kept home are well used: using them in the </p><p>Verification Division gives the Inspectors beneficial </p><p>experience and makes their field experience more available to </p><p>headquarters staff. </p><p>29.   (U) The ABAF noted that the two "required" additional </p><p>staff for the Technical Support Branch in paragraph 1.4.3 are </p><p>not actually included among the funded positions for 2004. </p><p>Although not noted in the ABAF report, the upgrading of a P-3 </p><p>to P-4 level in the Chemical Demilitarization Branch cited as </p><p>"required" in paragraph 1.4.4 also is not included in the </p><p>budget for 2004. </p><p> </p><p>30.   (U) There were no ABAF recommendations regarding this </p><p>section of the budget. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Programme 2 - Inspection Management </p><p>and Operations (Inspectorate) </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>31.   (U) Some members of ABAF questioned why there is in </p><p>Table 24 (p. 42) an EUR 500,000 request for training of </p><p>Inspector candidates in 2004 (compared to nothing requested </p><p>for 2003) in view of the fact that one of the basic </p><p>assumptions for the 2004 budget (see paragraph 3 of the </p><p>Executive Summary, p. 7) was that there would be no hiring of </p><p>new Inspectors. The Secretariat explained that the number of </p><p>Inspectors would not increase (in fact it will decrease from </p><p>174 to 173) but there would be turnover among the Inspectors </p><p>and thus the word "new" in that assumption should be changed </p><p>to "additional". The training is for the new Inspectors. </p><p>However, the Secretariat pointed out that the request for EUR </p><p>500,000 presumed the use of "on call" Inspectors (even though </p><p>use of "on call" Inspectors is not officially part of the </p><p>budget) and EUR 1,000,000 would be required if it turned out </p><p>that there would be no "on call" Inspectors. </p><p> </p><p>32.   (U) There were no ABAF recommendations specifically </p><p>regarding this programme. However, there were three </p><p>recommendations in this section of the report calling for </p><p>increased information in Tables 15, 16 and 17 in the overview </p><p>of Chapter One regarding inspections. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Programme 3 - International Cooperation </p><p>and Assistance </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>33.    (SBU) There was considerable discussion regarding </p><p>whether or not the extra EUR 450,000 added to this programme </p><p>for 2003 is or should be provided for in 2004. The </p><p>Secretariat indicated that the EUR 114,000 for the new </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>programmes in 2003 were included in 2004 but it was up to </p><p>Member States whether they wanted in 2004 again to divert </p><p>savings of EUR 336,000 from other programmes to ICA. The </p><p>Mexican member was very concerned that the extra EUR 450,000 </p><p>added to this programme for 2003 should be maintained for </p><p>2004 and she wanted a recommendation to this effect. The </p><p>Chairman indicated he substantively supported such a position </p><p>but, much to his credit, he insisted it would be </p><p>inappropriate for a technical body like ABAF to make such a </p><p>recommendation. Thus the ABAF merely noted the fact that the </p><p>level proposed for ICA for 2004 is less than the amount </p><p>funded in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Programme 4 - Secretariat for the Policy-Making </p><p> Organs and Subsidiary Bodies </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>34.    (U) There was little discussion of this programme and </p><p>the ABAF made no recommendations regarding it. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Programme 5 - External Relations </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>35.   (SBU) In his presentation and the follow-up discussion, </p><p>the Director for this programme made several interesting </p><p>points: </p><p> </p><p>-     Justification for the request for consultants (EUR </p><p>85,000 vs. 0 for 2003) for this programme should be sought </p><p>from the DG. </p><p>-     The increase for official travel (EUR 60,000 vs. EUR </p><p>20,000 in 2003) was due at least in large part to the need to </p><p>accompany the DG on his increased visits to Member States. </p><p>-     The new D-1 position in his office came from the office </p><p>of the DG and was not requested. </p><p> </p><p>36.   (SBU) The Director also insisted that the 2004 </p><p>allocation for general temporary assistance (GTA) for this </p><p>programme should be increased from the EUR 5,000 shown in the </p><p>budget (Table 40, p. 68) to EUR 45,000, and that this </p><p>increase was approved by the DG. The Director of </p><p>Administration did not agree with this and the ABAF decided </p><p>it could not accept the change without a piece of paper from </p><p>the DG. </p><p> </p><p>37.   (U) The ABAF had no recommendations relevant to this </p><p>programme aside from its recommendations regarding </p><p>consultants and official travel overall. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Programme 6 - Executive Management </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>38.   (SBU) The DDG made the presentation for this programme. </p><p>He stressed the need for partnership and trust between the DG </p><p>and the States Parties and ABAF. In particular, he urged the </p><p>need for giving the DG flexibility to reclassify and transfer </p><p>posts in order to take advantage of situations as they </p><p>develop. He indicated his own priority on working to develop </p><p>RBB and otherwise improve budget planning and implementation. </p><p>The U.S. member indicated partnership and trust between the </p><p>DG and the States Parties and ABAF would be very good for the </p><p>Organization and one way to help build that trust would be </p><p>for the Technical Secretariat to provide, in accord with RBB, </p><p>annual budget implementation reports (resulted in ABAF </p><p>recommendation reported in para. 12 above). The U.S. member </p><p>also urged that the TS submit a specific proposal for </p><p>granting the DG more flexibility regarding reclassifying and </p><p>transferring posts (resulted in ABAF recommendation reported </p><p>in para. 22 above). The DDG appeared to accept both points. </p><p> </p><p>39.    (SBU) Taking advantage of the presence of the DDG and </p><p>the Legal Adviser, ABAF members expressed concern about the </p><p>excessive use of GTA and, especially, the fact that many GTA </p><p>staff have been employed for considerable periods of time. </p><p>ABAF members and the Director of Administration indicated </p><p>concern that longtime use of GTA staff is unfair since they </p><p>often do much the same work as regular staff but are denied </p><p>the benefits of regular staff. As agreed by the Legal </p><p>Adviser, there is also the concern that this longtime use of </p><p>GTA staff could make the organization vulnerable to suits </p><p>before the ILOAT that could result in significant financial </p><p>liabilities for the organization. It also was pointed out </p><p>that the extensive use of GTA staff can be misleading to </p><p>States Parties since consideration of the staffing issue </p><p>tends to focus on just approved and funded positions while </p><p>overlooking the use of GTA staff. As a result, the ABAF </p><p>recommended that the Secretariat prepare a report on "all </p><p>aspects" of using GTA (implying the concerns expressed above, </p><p>but not wanting to be too specific). </p><p> </p><p>40.   (SBU) Reflecting concern about the use of overtime, the </p><p>ABAF requested information for its next session regarding </p><p>average overtime payment per person under each programme </p><p>during 2003. The location of this request in this section of </p><p>the ABAF report reflects attention drawn to the use of </p><p>overtime in the office of the DG especially. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Programme 7 - Administration </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>41.   (U) Since this programme was examined toward the end of </p><p>the session and the Director of Administration had been </p><p>present through so many of the meetings, there was not </p><p>prolonged discussion of this programme. However, the ABAF did </p><p>note that two branches of this division (Procurement and </p><p>Support Services; Information Systems) were each requesting </p><p>two additional posts and yet there were still significant </p><p>increases in GTA requests for both branches. This was a </p><p>matter that was not discussed with the Director of </p><p>Administration since it did not arise until the report was </p><p>being drafted. </p><p> </p><p>42.   (U) The added posts for Information Systems are </p><p>officially recognized as being included in the four posts to </p><p>be re-activated for 2004, but this is not true for the added </p><p>posts for Procurement and Support Services. Thus the latter </p><p>two are examples of the confusion regarding staffing levels </p><p>in the budget. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Programme 8 - Common Services Not </p><p>Distributed to Programmes </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>43.   (U) There was some discussion about the anomaly that, </p><p>while this programme is for common services not distributed </p><p>to programmes, specific shares of allocations in this </p><p>programme for GTA, overtime, official travel and consultants </p><p>are indicated for each of the programmes in sub-tables within </p><p>the separate sections for each of the programmes. However, </p><p>the ABAF notes that even this anomalous practice is not </p><p>followed consistently, i.e., all funds for consultants are </p><p>not included in programme 8 since three programmes have </p><p>allocations for consultants within their own budget tables. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>ELECTION OF CHAIRPERSON AND </p><p>VICE-CHAIRPERSON </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>44.   The current chairperson, Mr. Hadi Farajvand (Iran), was </p><p>elected to serve again as chairperson for the next session. </p><p>Despite his absence from this session, the current </p><p>vice-chairperson, Mr. Dudley Lashmar (UK), also was elected </p><p>to serve again for the next session. It was agreed that if he </p><p>did not show up for the next session, a new vice-chairperson </p><p>would elected. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>ANY OTHER BUSINESS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>45.   The Executive Council had requested an opinion from the </p><p>ABAF on Draft Financial Rule 9.1.02 concerning an upward </p><p>revision in the limit on the amount that the Organization is </p><p>allowed to invest in one institution. The revision calls for </p><p>increasing the limit from EUR 7 million to EUR 12 million in </p><p>order to allow the Organization to continue to earn </p><p>competitive rates on its short term investments. The ABAF </p><p>recommended approval of the draft amendment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>AGENDA ITEMS NOT COVERED </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>46.   Due to the lack of availability of the documents on the </p><p>"Strategic Plan on External Relations" and the "Strategic </p><p>Plan on Information Technology" until the first day of the </p><p>session, and due to time constraints, it was agreed to defer </p><p>consideration of these agenda items until the next session. </p><p>The "Draft OPCW 2005-2007 Medium Term Plan was not considered </p><p>because it was not provided. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>OBSERVATIONS/COMMENTS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>47.   (SBU) The functioning of the ABAF: </p><p> </p><p>-     Lack of documentation in advance was a real handicap. </p><p>-     The expertise of members could be improved, but it </p><p>still provides an opportunity to raise issues that need </p><p>attention, which can be of benefit to both the Member States </p><p>and the Secretariat. </p><p>-     While the current Chairman is somewhat handicapped by </p><p>his lack of budgetary expertise and his lack of full facility </p><p>with the English language, he does make a serious effort to </p><p>do good technical work. </p><p>-     The holding of budget consultations with Member States </p><p>at the same time that the ABAF was in session was </p><p>unfortunate. If ABAF reports have any value they should serve </p><p>to prepare Member States for more effective consultations </p><p>with the Secretariat on draft budgets. Since some ABAF </p><p>members come from delegations, they had to choose whether to </p><p>attend ABAF meetings or the Member State consultations. The </p><p>availability of Secretariat members for ABAF meetings also </p><p>was limited by their need to attend the Member State </p><p>consultations. </p><p>-     Much better Secretariat support is required for the </p><p>ABAF to be as effective as it needs to be. The secretary </p><p>assigned to the committee to assist in drafting the report </p><p>needs to be knowledgeable regarding administrative and </p><p>financial issues and terminology. </p><p>-     While the Director of Administration was often in </p><p>attendance, there should be someone always available from his </p><p>staff who is very knowledgeable about both </p><p>administrative/financial policies and practices in order to </p><p>respond to questions and/or find the appropriate staff member </p><p>to provide the responses required. </p><p> </p><p>48.   (U) The programme and budget: </p><p> </p><p>-     The programme and budget contained very little real </p><p>information. In particular, as indicated above, there was a </p><p>remarkable lack of justification or explanation for the major </p><p>increases and decreases proposed in the budget and there were </p><p>too many mistakes or inconsistencies in the budget document. </p><p>-     The activities in the object of expenditure tables need </p><p>to be cleaned out so that the Secretariat could present a </p><p>matrix showing how the different programmes compare in use of </p><p>various objects of expenditure. </p><p>-     The 2004 budget talks in terms of moving toward RBB, </p><p>but the "objectives" presented in the tables for the </p><p>different programmes most usually were really activities </p><p>rather than objectives. The budget clearly at this stage is </p><p>very much an input budget with little information about </p><p>results planned or achieved. </p><p> </p><p>49.   (U) The move to RBB: </p><p> </p><p>-     The Director of Administration is very pleased with the </p><p>consultants working on converting the organization to RBB. He </p><p>notes they did this for ILO. It would be good to examine the </p><p>success of RBB in ILO and to see some sample of what the </p><p>consultants are doing for OPCW before it is too late. </p><p>-     Success in using RBB is going to require a major </p><p>re-education of both the Member States and the Secretariat. </p><p>It is not clear what plans exist for this. </p><p> </p><p>50.   (U) The use of consultants: </p><p> </p><p>-     The Director of Administration is proud of the use of </p><p>Korn-Ferry to screen candidates and the use of another firm </p><p>for providing a psychological profile of candidates. Both </p><p>sound promising, but it would be interesting to know the </p><p>costs for these services and to get some objective evaluation </p><p>of the psychological profiling especially. </p><p> </p><p>51.   (U) The seven-year limit as an opportunity: </p><p> </p><p>-     The Director of Administration often referred to the </p><p>seven-year limit for staff tenure as an opportunity for </p><p>reshaping and updating the organization. This sounds </p><p>promising and efforts should be made to assure that advantage </p><p>is taken of this opportunity. Informal consultations on the </p><p>matter could be useful. </p><p> </p><p>52.   (SBU) Fraud: </p><p> </p><p>-     As noted above, the report of the External Auditor </p><p>indicates he was told there "were no fraud or losses in </p><p>2002." Such a claim for any organization must raise </p><p>questions, and the recent history of OPCW makes such a claim </p><p>especially questionable. It might be useful to probe deeper </p><p>on this matter with the representative of the External </p><p>Auditor to be sure there is not some cover-up at work. </p><p> </p><p>53.
