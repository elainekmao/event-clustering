<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000429 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/06/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREF, PHUM, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATOR RECEIVES SANCTUARY INSIDE </p><p>BRITISH EMBASSY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By:  COM CARMEN MARTINEZ. REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  A young man involved in a sidewalk </p><p>pro-democracy demonstration April 4 dashed into the British </p><p>embassy to avoid arrest and as of April 7, remains inside. </p><p>His co-demonstrator, a monk from Bago, is in regime hands. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) British embassy sources tell us that on Friday, April </p><p>4, a monk held up a pro-democracy placard while another young </p><p>man unfurled a pro-democracy flag on the sidewalk in front of </p><p>the British embassy in Rangoon.  Within ten seconds the monk </p><p>was grabbed by police and hustled off into custody.  The </p><p>other young man bolted into the embassy\'s lobby.  The </p><p>demonstrator is still inside as of April 7, being housed in a </p><p>consular section interview room.  The demonstrator does not </p><p>want to go outside, fearing (with some justification) that he </p><p>is likely to be arrested and sentenced to seven years in </p><p>prison.  The British embassy has been providing temporary </p><p>sanctuary, has been in close contact with London, and has </p><p>discussed the issue with Burmese officials. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Our British contacts emphasize that the young </p><p>demonstrator inside the embassy is not affiliated with the </p><p>NLD.  He is an ethnic Burman, is not a student, and does not </p><p>appear to be highly educated.  His flag sported a circle </p><p>around a fighting peacock on a red field, a general symbol of </p><p>student resistance.  It was attached to the flagstaff upside </p><p>down, we noted.  The young man told the British that the </p><p>monk, whom he assumes is being interviewed by the police, </p><p>does not know his true name.  The monk, reportedly from the </p><p>city of Bago, also uses a pseudonym. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The British embassy staff did not indicate what they </p><p>intend to do with their young guest.  Burmese MFA says this </p><p>is the first such incident in fifteen years, and tells the </p><p>British that they would be lenient with the young man (a </p><p>claim the British aren\'t buying).  Post will review our </p><p>policy on humanitarian sanctuary and walk-ins with the local </p><p>guard force, MSG detachment, and other embassy staff. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
