<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000595 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, EAID, PINR, YM, WTRO, ECON/COM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN\'S ECONOMY AS SEEN BY WORLD BANK ECONOMISTS </p><p> </p><p>1. Sensitive But Unclassified, please protect. </p><p> </p><p> 2. (SBU) Summary: Two World Bank economists in Sanaa are </p><p>complimentary about the ROYG\'s fiscal policy and commitment </p><p>to reforms. In a March 17 discussion with Emboffs, the bank </p><p>economists gave positive assessments of Yemeni fiscal </p><p>discipline, currency management and WTO prospects. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Fiscal Policy </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) World Bank Senior Economist for Yemen Nadir A. </p><p>Mohammed (please protect throughout) and Economist Mohammed </p><p>Al-Sabbry both have positive forecasts for the Yemeni economy </p><p>despite Yemen\'s per capita income of $460 USG, literacy rates </p><p>of 56 %, and prospects for oil revenues dwindling in the next </p><p>five years.  Nadir said that while they have a huge </p><p>challenge, the Yemenis are on the right track.  Citing five </p><p>billion dollars in foreign reserves, he said the ROYG </p><p>compared favorably to other countries that have spent their </p><p>recently increased oil revenue less wisely. (Note: Yemen </p><p>Central Bank Figures for February report 4.75 Billion USG in </p><p>Reserves. End Note.) Mohammed said that he was impressed with </p><p>the frankness and openness of his Yemeni contacts, and felt </p><p>that the ROYG\'s fiscal policy was sound.  He said that the </p><p>ROYG appears to have learned lessons from 1991 (the first </p><p>Gulf War), and 1994 (the abortive rebellion in the South). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Currency </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Nadir also praised the ROYG Central Bank for holding </p><p>firm on its decision to float the riyal.  Nadir\'s point was </p><p>confirmed when on March 19 Pol/Econoff visited Omar S. </p><p>Bazara, the Payment Systems Director of the Yemeni Central </p><p>Bank. He reported that the Central Bank was selling dollars </p><p>to keep the riyal from slipping further on the dollar as a </p><p>result of worries about an attack on Iraq. For the last </p><p>month, the riyal had held firm at 182 riyals to the USG </p><p>dollar, but yesterday the rate had increased to 183 Yemeni </p><p>riyals to the dollar. One of our FSNs reported that same day </p><p>that the black market rate had risen to 186 riyals to the </p><p>dollar. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Yemen\'s Bid to Join the World Trade Organization </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Mohammed was optimistic on the ROYG\'s prospects for a </p><p>faster than average accession to the World Trade </p><p>Organization. He estimated that it could take four to five </p><p>years, less than the average seven to eight years, because </p><p>Yemen\'s neighbors and others are unlikely to press strong </p><p>objections to Yemen\'s candidacy. (Background: In October </p><p>2002, Yemen submitted its Memorandum on Foreign Trade Regime </p><p>to the World Trade Organization. End Background.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Fishing Rights </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Mohammed Al-Sabbry said that the Bank was closely </p><p>following USG efforts to improve the capacity of the Yemeni </p><p>Coast Guard and Navy because the illegal harvesting of fish </p><p>has adversely affected the Yemeni fishing industry. </p><p>Specifically, Chinese fishermen take their boats to the Red </p><p>Sea to harvest and process their fish.  According to Nadir </p><p>Mohammed, the Chinese obtain licenses for a lower amount of </p><p>fish, then through bribery of unnamed Yemeni officials, </p><p>vastly exceed their allotment. Fishermen from Egypt, Eritrea </p><p>and Ethiopia also have been over-fishing in Yemeni </p><p>territorial waters.  Al-Sabbry said that Bank experts are </p><p>worried that if Yemen promotes fish exports too heavily, the </p><p>waters might be over fished, damaging a potentially lucrative </p><p>resource for the ROYG. Thus, any effort to improve the </p><p>ability of the ROYG to protect their fishing rights will have </p><p>a direct impact on the local economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Boycott on US/Israeli Products </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Pol/Econ Chief noticed a sticker pasted onto the front </p><p>door of the Jordanian owned restaurant calling for a boycott </p><p>of American and Israeli products. He wondered aloud in the </p><p>owner\'s presence why the sticker was so prominently </p><p>displayed.  After the meal, Pol/Econ chief noticed that the </p><p>sign had been removed. However, other contacts report mixed </p><p>results for the boycott of US and Israeli goods. The local </p><p>Pepsi distributor told one of our FSNs that he had seen only </p><p>a 10% decline in business in 2002, noting that this decrease </p><p>was much less than Pepsi had felt in other countries. A </p><p>colleague at the British Embassy related a story about taking </p><p>a delegation of nine British security officials to do some </p><p>shopping at a store where a boycott sign was displayed. The </p><p>team made the removal of the sign a condition of doing </p><p>business with the store, but the owner refused to comply and </p><p>the team went elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Bio Note </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Nadir Mohammed said that he was born in the Sudan, </p><p>and received his doctorate in Economics from Cambridge </p><p>University where he also completed his post doctoral studies </p><p>and did some teaching. He has worked at the Islamic </p><p>Development Bank in Washington, and has held jobs with the </p><p>World Bank in Morocco, Ethiopia and Egypt. He expects to </p><p>leave Yemen in the coming year and said he would like an </p><p>assignment in Southeast Asia. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
