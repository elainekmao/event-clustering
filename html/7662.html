<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002695 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY APRIL 25: POSITIVE NEWS ON </p><p>TREASURY APPOINTMENT; CENTRAL BANK CUTS SHORT-TERM RATES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  Some positive news came at the end of a </p><p>relatively quiet week in Turkish markets:  the GOT announced </p><p>a well-regarded macro-economist bureaucrat, Ibrahim Canakci, </p><p>to replace Faik Oztrak at Treasury.  The Central Bank </p><p>announced a 3 percentage point cut in its short-term </p><p>borrowing rate, which led immediately to a one percentage </p><p>point decline in T-bill yields.  Market sentiment at end </p><p>April is much improved from earlier in the month, but </p><p>investors both local and foreign remain wary of AK\'s </p><p>commitment to the reform program.  Further improvements on </p><p>interest rates (below the low 50\'s) are likely only to follow </p><p>tangible progress on reforms, as measured by the next IMF </p><p>staff mission, now scheduled to start May 21.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Quiet, T-Bill Rates Decline </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On April 25, yields on the lira T-bills declined </p><p>about one percentage point to 55 percent compounded, </p><p>immediately following the Central Bank\'s announcement of a </p><p>rate cut (see below).  T-bill yields, trading all week at the </p><p>56-57 percent level, are now expected to decline to the low </p><p>50\'s.  The lira was flat, trading at TL 1,595,000 to the </p><p>dollar while the Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 index was up 1.3 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Central Bank Cuts Key </p><p>Lira Borrowing Rate </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) At OOB April 25, the Central Bank announced a cut </p><p>in its short-term borrowing rates:  the key lira borrowing </p><p>rate, one week maturity, went from 44 to 41 percent simple </p><p>(or to about 51.5 percent compounded). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment: The markets exerted some pressure for this </p><p>rate cut and responded immediately by lowering T-bill yields. </p><p> PM Erdogan also predicted interest rates declines in his </p><p>weekly meeting with AK parliamentarians April 24.   In an </p><p>April 24 meeting with Central Bank Governor Serdengecti on </p><p>other topics (Iraqi assets), the Governor told us such </p><p>political pressure didn\'t work on him - former MinState </p><p>Dervis\'s many attempts to dictate interest rate policy had </p><p>just slowed down the Central Bank decision making process. </p><p>However, he continued, the outlook on inflation was turning </p><p>positive.  Serdengecti spoke about the need for an </p><p>inflation-targeting Central Bank to help shape expectations </p><p>through interest rate policy, not just react to market </p><p>perceptions.  Today\'s decision may be viewed by some analysts </p><p>as premature (given continuing strong concerns in the </p><p>market), but it may also help bring down inflationary </p><p>expectations.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New Treasury Undersecretary A Good Choice </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) On April 26, MinState Ali Babacan announced the </p><p>appointment of Ibrahim Canakci as Treasury Undersecretary, </p><p>replacing Faik Oztrak.  (Note:  "Undersecretary" in case of </p><p>Treasury and some other GOT agencies is the head of the </p><p>agency.)  Canakci, 41 years old, worked at the State Planning </p><p>Organization from 1986-2000, rising to head of the Economic </p><p>Forecasting Department.  While at SPO, he earned a Masters in </p><p>Economics from Michigan State University.  In 2000, he moved </p><p>to the Bank Regulatory and Supervision Agency, first to run </p><p>the research department, later to be the Deputy Chairman. </p><p>he is married, with two children and speaks fluent English. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  Comment:  The Treasury Undersecretary runs the </p><p>GOT\'s main economic policy agency and serves as the </p><p>day-to-day contact with the IMF and World Bank.  Canakci, </p><p>well known to the Embassy since his SPO days, is an excellent </p><p>choice; markets are likely to be relieved given the other, </p><p>less credible names bandied about.  He has a strong </p><p>macro-economic background (and worked for Faik Oztrak when </p><p>they both were at SPO), understands and supports the reform </p><p>program, and furthermore has a good background on banking </p><p>sector issues.  Canakci is religiously observant (observes </p><p>the dawn-dusk Ramadan fast), though he is not an AK partisan </p><p>and has independent views on the party\'s economic policies. </p><p>His low-key, mild-mannered approach may well help in </p><p>educating AK politicians on economic reforms in a </p><p>non-confrontational way. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
