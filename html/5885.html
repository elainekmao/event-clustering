<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 000471 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL, IO AND WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: VIVANCO MISSION:  STATE OF PLAY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  Human Rights Watch Latin America Director </p><p>Jose Miguel Vivanco visited Guatemala February 11-14 to </p><p>consult with the GOG, the Human Rights Ombudsman, and human </p><p>rights leaders about the Ombudsman\'s proposal to create an </p><p>international Commission to Investigate Clandestine Groups </p><p>(CICIACS).  The Ombudsman and NGO leaders were skeptical of </p><p>any effort to change the existing proposal; the GOG publicly </p><p>supported Vivanco\'s efforts.  We expect Vivanco to come back </p><p>with a modified proposal in early March.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>FM Welcomes CICIACS Proposal With Reservations </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On February 14, after meeting with Vivanco to discuss </p><p>the CICIACS proposal the day before, Foreign Minister Edgar </p><p>Gutierrez publicly expressed GOG support for what Vivanco </p><p>will achieve through his consultations.  The FM also called </p><p>the proposal "possible to improve" and gave his own </p><p>"suggestions:"  that the CICIACS be authorized by Congress; </p><p>that its membership be expanded to include representatives of </p><p>Congress, the Public Ministry and the Ombudsman; and that its </p><p>mandate include investigation of crimes implicating private </p><p>security forces and organized crime, in addition to groups </p><p>linked to state agents.  The Ombudsman promptly replied </p><p>publicly that Gutierrez\' suggestions added nothing to the </p><p>existing proposal, and human rights leaders said the GOG </p><p>should now propose the creation of a CICIACS to the UN and </p><p>OAS. </p><p> </p><p>Vivanco Upbeat Despite Tough Early Rounds with NGOs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Jose Miguel Vivanco told the Ambassador, HROff, </p><p>PolCouns, AID officer and PolOff on February 12 that he </p><p>thought he had allayed human rights groups\' concerns about </p><p>his role as facilitator of the proposal for a commission to </p><p>investigate clandestine groups and had made some progress as </p><p>follows. </p><p> </p><p>Process: </p><p> </p><p>-- Vivanco acknowledged that his personal prestige and </p><p>credibility is on the line, and said the GOG had not yet </p><p>limited his efforts in any way. </p><p> </p><p>-- Vivanco said he was to meet with the Attorney General </p><p>later that evening, at the AG\'s insistent request. </p><p> </p><p>-- He would meet with FM Gutierrez on February 13 to get into </p><p>the substance of the proposal for the first time since being </p><p>named as "facilitator" by the GOG. </p><p> </p><p>-- He would leave Guatemala on February 14 and would work on </p><p>a proposal based on what he has discussed during his visit, </p><p>in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>-- He will share with us a draft of what he intends to </p><p>propose, and would appreciate Embassy comment and any </p><p>suggestions. </p><p> </p><p>-- He will return to Guatemala in early March to press the </p><p>GOG to accept key elements of a commission. </p><p> </p><p>Substantive Aspects of a Vivanco Proposal: </p><p> </p><p>-- Vivanco said he is willing to disown any effort which is </p><p>not viable to investigate and lead to criminal prosecution. </p><p>Anything less would be a "show" and not worth the effort. </p><p> </p><p>-- After consulting with Guatemalan constitutional experts, </p><p>he believes that legislation, not just a government decree, </p><p>is necessary to give the commission sufficient authority to </p><p>survive legal challenges, compel testimony through subpoena, </p><p>and, possibly, to engage in plea bargaining to build cases. </p><p> </p><p>-- He believes the key elements of any commission must </p><p>include more prosecutorial expertise at the commissioner </p><p>level, not just in the technical staff ranks.  To do so, he </p><p>has suggested to NGOs that the commissioners be increased </p><p>from three to five, to include three nominated by President </p><p>Portillo from a list of candidates selected by the ombudsman. </p><p> The additional two commissioners would be Guatemalan or </p><p>foreigners with impeccable prosecutorial expertise, "like </p><p>(Spanish investigative magistrate Baltazar) Garzon," he told </p><p>NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>-- He believes that the commission must be autonomous but </p><p>will also need police participation, and suggests a specially </p><p>vetted group. </p><p> </p><p>-- He has consulted with Peruvian special prosecutor Jose </p><p>Ugaz, who gave him the idea about including police, as long </p><p>as they can be vetted. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Without endorsing his specific proposals, the </p><p>Ambassador expressed strong support for Vivanco\'s efforts to </p><p>put together a proposal for a viable commission.  He confided </p><p>in a short aside to Vivanco that NGOs continue to have </p><p>misgivings about Vivanco\'s role, and will be particularly </p><p>skeptical to any GOG elements (especially police) working </p><p>with a commission and the proposal to enlarge the commission. </p><p> PolCouns warned that defining the scope of the investigation </p><p>will be important and that the GOG may attempt to do so in a </p><p>manner that protects itself. </p><p> </p><p>HR Groups Still Have Misgivings About Vivanco </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The Ambassador met with human rights leaders (Helen </p><p>Mack, Frank LaRue, Orlando Blanco, Gustavo Meono, Miguel </p><p>Angel Albizures, and Nery Rodenas) on February 14 to discuss </p><p>their views of Vivanco\'s facilitation efforts.  The human </p><p>rights leaders expressed continued reservations about </p><p>Vivanco\'s mission, although LaRue said that they were </p><p>relieved to have clarified that Human Rights Watch stands </p><p>behind Vivanco\'s efforts.  They then described the following </p><p>points of disagreement with Vivanco\'s suggestions: </p><p> </p><p>a) Commission Composition:  increasing the commission members </p><p>from 3 to 5 would upset the balance envisioned by the NGOs. </p><p>Instead, they suggest that the Attorney General use his power </p><p>under Article 44 of the Public Ministry\'s statutes to make an </p><p>agreement with the commission that includes the naming of a </p><p>Special Prosecutor (with commission input) to work with the </p><p>commission, but not be a member of it.  The commission could </p><p>include distinguished prosecutors or jurists named by the </p><p>three member institutions (UN, OAS, GOG), and should also </p><p>hire this expertise for the technical staff level.  LaRue </p><p>added that it would be good if the US could provide staff for </p><p>this purpose.  The commission should not be expanded, which </p><p>would open it to undue GOG manipulation.  Vivanco had </p><p>suggested that the Special Prosecutor be a full member of the </p><p>commission, which they reject. </p><p> </p><p>b) Legal Foundation:  Helen Mack argued that after consulting </p><p>with legal experts, the NGOs propose that the GOG negotiate </p><p>an agreement with the UN and OAS on the creation of the </p><p>commission (including immunities, scope, composition etc.) </p><p>and that the Congress ratify the agreement with a legislative </p><p>accord.  This is how MINUGUA and the Historical Clarification </p><p>Commission were both set up. </p><p> </p><p>c) Initiating Prosecution:  LaRue emphasized that the </p><p>commission must finish its investigation and report before </p><p>pursuing individual cases.  To do the reverse would bog the </p><p>commission down in legal processes and cripple its ability to </p><p>complete a full report. </p><p> </p><p>d) Investigation Period:  Mack indicated that she thought 18 </p><p>months would not be enough to complete the investigation, and </p><p>mentioned a 24-month maximum time period as preferable. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Meono, who accompanied the Ombudsman on his recent </p><p>visit to Washington and New York, reported that consultations </p><p>there with the UN (including the office of the UN High </p><p>Commissioner for Human Rights), OAS (including someone from </p><p>the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights), and </p><p>Department of State were encouraging.  Helen Mack said that </p><p>MINUGUA has been privately very supportive of the proposal. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The Ambassador told the group that he intends to </p><p>meet with the Ombudsman to discuss his views and show Embassy </p><p>support.  He also asked the groups to send us the latest copy </p><p>of their revised proposal as soon possible (Mack later told </p><p>us she will need more internal discussions before they can </p><p>send a new document to us.)  In response to the Ambassador\'s </p><p>inquiry of how we can help: </p><p> </p><p>--Blanco asked that the USG reinforce the urgency of getting </p><p>a commission started to the GOG.  They expect Vivanco to </p><p>produce a draft by around Feb. 19, and to be back in </p><p>Guatemala in early March.  The GOG should not be allowed to </p><p>delay its acceptance of a proposal past mid-March. </p><p> </p><p>-- Mack suggested that the Ambassador speak to FM Gutierrez </p><p>and encourage the GOG to stick with the 3-member commission </p><p>proposal.  Mack also requested that the Ambassador discuss </p><p>the proposal with Attorney General de Leon and encourage him </p><p>to support the idea of entering an agreement with the </p><p>commission, including the naming of a Special Prosecutor to </p><p>work with the commission.  She suggested the Ambassador </p><p>emphasize that it is his constitutional obligation to support </p><p>the commission.  LaRue suggested the Ambassador also tell the </p><p>AG that the commission is not seeking to displace the MP, but </p><p>to support its work. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Vivanco seemed a little taken aback by the </p><p>suspicious reception from his friends in the human rights </p><p>community, commenting that he had been grilled for over an </p><p>hour about any stipend or per diem he might be receiving. </p><p>That suspicion is based on the misgivings about the GOG\'s </p><p>intentions for the CICIACS proposal more than doubts about </p><p>Vivanco himself.  His exploration of modifications to </p><p>strengthen the proposal, in his view, only worsened those </p><p>doubts.  Gutierrez\' public comments were viewed with the same </p><p>skepticism.  Should he return with a substantially modified </p><p>proposal, Vivanco may find the human rights groups a harder </p><p>sell than Portillo.  We will do what we can to facilitate the </p><p>work of the facilitator, once we receive Vivanco\'s draft. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
