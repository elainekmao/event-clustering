(U) Amid an enthusiastic reception, the Government of </p><p>Jordan launched the Jordan Fund, a $50 million fund designed </p><p>to attract foreign investment and provide capital to the </p><p>local private sector.  Deutsche Bank is acting as </p><p>International Advisor for the Fund, with Jordanian investment </p><p>banking firm Atlas Investment Group and Foursan Group, a </p><p>Jordanian private equity and venture capital investment firm </p><p>providing the management.  The Fund will focus on </p><p>opportunities with local, innovative companies, as well as </p><p>companies that take advantage of global opportunities such as </p><p>the U.S. - Jordan Free Trade Agreement.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Minister of Finance Michel Marto, Deutsche Bank Vice </p><p>President for Global Corporate Finance Jeffrey Culpepper, </p><p>Atlas Investment Group Director General Omar Masri, and </p><p>Foursan Group Partners Nashat Masri and Leith Masri presided </p><p>over the launch of the Jordan Fund October 29 before a group </p><p>of investors, diplomats, and government officials. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The government has contributed $20 million, from </p><p>privatization proceeds, toward the Fund\'s $50 million target </p><p>capitalization.  The remaining $30 million will come from </p><p>private investors and local institutions.  Minimum </p><p>investments in the fund are set at $1 million for </p><p>institutions and $500,000 for noninstitutional investors. </p><p>Incorporated in the Cayman Islands, the Fund\'s stated </p><p>objective is threefold: to generate attractive returns on </p><p>investment, to provide capital to enable Jordanian businesses </p><p>to modernize and expand, and to promote consolidation in </p><p>business and industry through mergers and acquisitions.  A </p><p>Board of Directors, comprised of two members from Deutsche </p><p>Bank, two  from the Government of Jordan, and one from the </p><p>investment management partnership of Atlas and Foursan, will </p><p>make investment decisions based on recommendations by the </p><p>Fund manager. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The size of the Fund\'s investments will range from $3 </p><p>million to $7 million, with   The Fund\'s management receiving </p><p>2% per year of the subscribed amount of the Fund, a </p><p>performance fee of 20% of the profits over 8% per year, and a </p><p>placement fee of 2% of the subscription price of shares. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Marto called formation of the Fund a "vote of </p><p>confidence" in the direction the government was taking in </p><p>progressive economic reform.  Culpepper said the Fund was the </p><p>"brainchild" of King Abdullah and stressed the Fund would </p><p>support local, innovative companies, as well as firms that </p><p>take advantage of opportunities generated via the U.S.- </p><p>Jordan Free Trade Agreement and other international trade </p><p>pacts. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Along with the Social Security Corporation\'s new $150 </p><p>million investment fund, the Jordan Fund fills a void for </p><p>local companies needing capital but unable to find it from </p><p>risk-averse Jordanian and regional banking and lending </p><p>institutions.  The Fund is likely to pursue opportunities </p><p>such as Microsoft\'s investment in Estarta (REFTEL), a </p><p>successful merger of two local IT companies resulting in </p><p>economies of scale, and, buoyed by Microsoft\'s support, a </p><p>coming player in the regional IT market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
