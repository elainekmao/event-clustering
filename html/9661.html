<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 001902 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, KDEM, PGOV, KJUS, KCOR, KCRM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: STATUS OF GUATEMALAN COUNTER-NARCOTICS COOPERATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 1679 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 1693 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador John Hamilton for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: GOG cooperation in the war on drugs has had </p><p>several concrete successes in the past six months, and there </p><p>has been further progress since the June 30 Inter-Agency </p><p>meeting in which the Ambassador participated.  A quick run </p><p>down on </p><p>our benchmarks: cocaine seizures have increased fourfold; </p><p>extraditions have resumed; more than $19 million in drug </p><p>profits have been seized; Guatemala\'s major trafficker is on </p><p>the run; five tons of cocaine evidence held by the courts has </p><p>been destroyed; an asset forfeiture law was passed by </p><p>Congress, and the courts have accelerated the sale of seized </p><p>assets; a counter-narcotics maritime agreement has been </p><p>signed and passed to Congress for ratification; and </p><p>regulations controlling precursor chemicals have been </p><p>officially published.  Not all benchmarks have been fully </p><p>met, however.  And the GOG is clearly not keen on </p><p>investigating a (non-drug) corruption case that may involve </p><p>President Portillo. Nonetheless, we believe a decision to </p><p>fully recertify Guatemala is warranted. We recommend </p><p>developing new benchmarks for evaluating the GOG\'s </p><p>counter-narcotics cooperation for the next year.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Three years of steadily declining cooperation by the </p><p>GOG in the war on drugs came to an end in March when, as a </p><p>result of our decertification, the GOG put together an </p><p>inter-institutional team (including members of the executive, </p><p>judiciary, legislature and Attorney General\'s Office) to </p><p>provide concrete actions in response to our counter-narcotics </p><p>concerns.  The inter-agency process in Washington identified </p><p>nine benchmarks that would be the measures by which </p><p>"recertification" would be considered.  The GOG has dedicated </p><p>considerable energy and political capital to meeting each of </p><p>these benchmarks over the past six months.  Several of the </p><p>benchmarks have been fully met; others have been </p><p>substantially met.  Reftels outlined the status of compliance </p><p>with the benchmarks through the end of June.  During the past </p><p>four weeks there have been several further advances, </p><p>especially in the areas of the bilateral counternarcotics </p><p>maritime agreement, SAIA institutional development, </p><p>police-prosecutor cooperation, asset forfeitures and </p><p>collaborative efforts to make seizures. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Other areas have not seen the same level of successes. </p><p> The Attorney General\'s office is prosecuting a major scandal </p><p>of the Social Security Institute (IGSS) and removed the </p><p>ineffective money laundering prosecutor Lilly Chinchilla (at </p><p>our request), but has just named her to head the </p><p>anti-corruption prosecutor\'s office.  While that office </p><p>focuses on official corruption cases, not narcotics cases, </p><p>the naming of Chinchilla to head that unit was a setback for </p><p>anti-corruption efforts in Guatemala.  The Attorney General\'s </p><p>decision was widely viewed as aimed at protecting President </p><p>Portillo from potential prosecution in a corruption scandal </p><p>known locally as the Panama Case.  Whether that case involves </p><p>drug money laundering is not clear. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>PROGRESS SINCE THE JUNE 30 IAWG MEETING </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>BILATERAL COUNTER-NARCOTICS MARITIME AGREEMENT SIGNED AND </p><p>AWAITING RATIFICATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) On June 19, Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez and the </p><p>Ambassador signed the bilateral counternarcotics maritime </p><p>agreement. The agreement had its first of three required </p><p>readings before Congress in early July, and was assigned to </p><p>the International Affairs Committee for review. The agreement </p><p>was approved by the committee on July 15 and returned to </p><p>Congress, where it will be considered in the next </p><p>extraordinary session.  In committee it enjoyed the support </p><p>of all the major parties, and we do not anticipate </p><p>significant opposition to it when it is considered in </p><p>extraordinary session. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>SAIA REGULATIONS AMENDED TO PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC POLYGRAPH </p><p>AND URINALYSIS TESTING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The GOG provided us with the final copy of the </p><p>internal regulations for the anti-narcotics police (SAIA in </p><p>Spanish).  The regulations were signed by the Director of the </p><p>National Police and placed into effect on June 25. The </p><p>regulations only provided for polygraph and urinalysis </p><p>testing to be conducted upon initial entry into the unit, and </p><p>not at irregular intervals throughout an officer\'s career as </p><p>we had recommended.  The Ambassador raised this with the </p><p>Minister of Government, and NAS Director raised with the </p><p>director of the SAIA, and they amended the SAIA regulations </p><p>to include periodic retesting.  The target is for testing </p><p>every six months, beginning in August.  We will continue to </p><p>monitor the implementation of this initiative to evaluate its </p><p>overall effectiveness. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>POLICE-PROSECUTOR NARCOACTIVITY TASK FORCE FORMING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Per ref A, on June 17 the Attorney General and the </p><p>Minister of Government signed an agreement that commits the </p><p>two institutions to form combined task forces in the areas of </p><p>money laundering and narcoactivity.  The agreement states </p><p>that these task forces were being formed as a result of the </p><p>success of the existing task force on anticorruption.  We </p><p>have received a copy of the internal regulation for the </p><p>pre-selection and periodic retesting of personnel assigned to </p><p>the unit. This screening will include local polygraph and </p><p>urinalyses testing for involvement in corrupt activities and </p><p>the use of illicit substances. It will have the first ever </p><p>financial disclosure and periodic background investigation. </p><p>Though still in its developmental stages, this initiative </p><p>will be a model for other programs. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>LIQUIDATION OF SEIZED ASSETS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The Judicial Branch has begun auctioning off seized </p><p>aircraft. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the </p><p>chief of the judicial warehouse met with NAS Director to </p><p>explain the process for the sale of seized assets. The </p><p>legislation they are using is Decree 69-71, which was signed </p><p>in 1971. It was further amplified last November with </p><p>Agreement 81.002, which establishes a period of two months </p><p>for interested parties to claim seized property. This </p><p>agreement only affects those items in the warehouse that were </p><p>seized before January 1, 1999. Currently there is a list of </p><p>fourteen aircraft that are available for auction. The </p><p>aircraft were seized as far back as 1983.  The judicial </p><p>warehouse is also auctioning off other items. It is estimated </p><p>that approximately 10% of all of the seized property was </p><p>derived from narcotrafficking activities. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>ITINERANT JUDGES TO EXPEDITE WARRANT PROCESS AND MAKE IT </p><p>SECURE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) In an effort to expedite the issuance of search </p><p>warrants and prevent the release of sensitive law enforcement </p><p>information, the Supreme Court has agreed to name two judges </p><p>to serve as itinerant judges in the nationwide service of </p><p>warrants and arrests. The chief magistrate told us this week </p><p>that he now has the two judges identified, but that he was </p><p>awaiting the vehicles and assigned PNC personnel. The naming </p><p>of these judges will greatly enhance the ability of the </p><p>courts to move to any given location and conduct enforcement </p><p>activities with a minimum of detractors or loss of </p><p>information. Its will also increase the speed at which law </p><p>enforcement activities could be conducted. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>SEIZURES RISING </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (U)  Between January 1 and July 24, 2003, the GOG seized </p><p>3,718 kilos of cocaine.  Since March, JIATF)South has </p><p>reported 41 suspect air tracks. Although the Guatemalan </p><p>military has not responded to every event, they have </p><p>responded to every event they have been asked to by us. Given </p><p>communication limitations, often information does not reach </p><p>the Guatemalans with sufficient time to respond adequately. </p><p>They have however, developed a response plan, which includes </p><p>dedicating aircraft in the various parts of the country to </p><p>respond with the SAIA and Public Ministry to just such </p><p>events. Of those 41 reported events, the Guatemalans were </p><p>able to respond to ten.  Two of these resulted in the largest </p><p>seizure this calendar year.  Since the GOG improved its </p><p>response mechanisms, suspect tracks have diminished over </p><p>Guatemala.  We are also seeing traffickers switching to </p><p>nighttime flights; to overflights of Guatemala directly into </p><p>Mexico; and to flights that include stops for random periods </p><p>of time in neighboring countries and which start up too close </p><p>to Guatemala to permit an opportune launch. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Control of drug trafficking at the points of entry </p><p>(i.e. airports, land border crossings and seaports) remains </p><p>deficient, especially at the airport.  In conjunction with </p><p>DEA, NAS and TAT at post, the GOG has targeted major </p><p>trafficker Otto Herrera, and has conducted important </p><p>disruption operations against his organization.  Herrera </p><p>himself is on the run, after losing over $14 million in drug </p><p>proceeds seized by the GOG at one of his former safe houses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p>-------- </p><p>11. (C) A comment on seizures:  According to CNC data, </p><p>Guatemala seized an estimated 5.6% of the cocaine moving </p><p>through, over or around Guatemala in 2002. Seizures in 2003 </p><p>at mid-year stood at 150% of the total for 2002, thus </p><p>increasing the seizure rate by a significant but </p><p>indeterminate amount (since we have no data on illicit </p><p>narcotic flows for 2003). For purposes of comparison, CNC </p><p>estimates the USG seizure rate of cocaine entering the US at </p><p>only 12.2%. The two situations are not all together </p><p>comparable, however, in that Guatemala lacks an end-game </p><p>capability for overflights, whereas the U.S. does have an </p><p>end-game capability. Our point is that the relatively low </p><p>seizure rate here is not in and of itself a measure of </p><p>political will or the lack thereof. </p><p> </p><p>12.(C) Further comment: If Guatemala is recertified, it is </p><p>critical that momentum be maintained by presenting the GOG </p><p>with new benchmarks that would represent our standard for </p><p>measuring continued cooperation for the next year.  With a </p><p>new government assuming office in January, 2004, it will be </p><p>important to get movement on the new benchmarks started by </p><p>the current government so that time is not lost in the </p><p>transition.  Post welcomes inter-agency views on priorities </p><p>for benchmarks for the coming year. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
