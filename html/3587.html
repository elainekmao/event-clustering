<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002522 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FUROR OVER INEC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA: 1159 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER;  REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The Independent National Electoral Commission </p><p>(INEC) faces serious challenges in its efforts to prepare </p><p>Nigeria for early 2003 national, state and local elections. </p><p>Nigerians know these elections are crucial in determining </p><p>whether their democracy survives and is strengthened or </p><p>whether it falters and perhaps crumbles.  Many people suspect </p><p>INEC and its taciturn Chairman, Abel Guobadia, are not up to </p><p>the task. Murmuring about INEC\'s inability has given way to </p><p>public grousing and calls for the Chairman and his </p><p>Commissioners to resign. To be fair, the Presidency\'s failure </p><p>to release funds in a timely manner caused many of INEC\'s </p><p>problems. However, many  INEC wounds were self-inflicted. </p><p>INEC did not plan voter registration properly or timely, a </p><p>corruption scandal in the Legal Department now dogs the </p><p>Commission, and INEC has been on the wrong end of lawsuits </p><p>over party registration. More importantly, the perception </p><p>that INEC is not its own agent but takes marching orders from </p><p>the Presidency is widespread. INEC needs to clean up its act </p><p>and image quickly for it to play the important role of a </p><p>neutral, technically competent conductor for these historic </p><p>elections.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>LACK OF PREPARATION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) INEC Commissioner Guobadia called on Ambassador Jeter </p><p>and other Mission officers on August 7. The Commissioner </p><p>opened the dialogue by defending INEC\'s independence. </p><p>However, he admitted that INEC\'s image had been compromised </p><p>by its inability to produce a voter register in time for May </p><p>or August local government elections. Guobadia attributed </p><p>this lapse to several factors-- the Federal Government\'s </p><p>failure to release funds until May 2002, the Local Government </p><p>Authority (LGA) crisis and consequent court ruling, and the </p><p>court challenge over new party registration. Guobadia claimed </p><p>INEC was ready for voters\' registration in July, but the </p><p>registration of new parties and their subsequent lawsuits </p><p>prevented them from moving ahead.  (Comment:  Guobadia was </p><p>correct in stating that the timing for voter registration was </p><p>dependent on party registration.  However, he conveniently </p><p>forgot a most crucial point. INEC controlled the timing and </p><p>pace of party registration. Thus, the bottleneck created when </p><p>the party\'s were not registered bears INEC\'s fingerprints </p><p>because it was caused by INEC\'s lethargy and lack of having </p><p>defined the "critical path" for scheduling electoral </p><p>preparations. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Dr. Guobadia cited deficiencies in the voter </p><p>registration process for 1999 elections as the cause of </p><p>election irregularities; to prevent a recurrence, a national </p><p>committee had been established to evaluate the security and </p><p>integrity of the process. This committee hopes to complete </p><p>its work by the end of August. According to Guobadia, the </p><p>registration exercise could begin in September and local </p><p>elections could be held in early January. (Comment: Again, </p><p>Guobadia was playing fast with the facts. Previously, he </p><p>contended INEC was ready for voter registration in July only </p><p>to state later that the ad hoc committee on voter </p><p>registration would not complete its work until the end of </p><p>August. The two assertions are ahrd to reconcile. In reality, </p><p>the special committee was not formed in order to prevent the </p><p>repeat of 1999\'s mistakes; it was established in response to </p><p>myriad complaints, particularly from Northern political </p><p>elites and traditional rulers, against the registration plans </p><p>formulated by Guobadia\'s INEC. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Despite many objections, the Chairman asserted INEC </p><p>is ready to go to the field for voter registration. </p><p>Non-delivery of the cameras necessary to produce the official </p><p>registration card means that a temporary card would be </p><p>necessary. (NOTE: This method not only opens another door for </p><p>either fraud or disenfranchisement, but also necessitates at </p><p>least two, perhaps three, trips to the registration site </p><p>before voters would receive their official identifications. </p><p>This could prove somewhat onerous to the rural poor who might </p><p>have to walk several miles just to reach the closest site, </p><p>meaning these bucolic pedestrians would have to traverse such </p><p>long distances multiple times in back-and-forth round-trips. </p><p>Based on the threat of boycott and the serious logistical </p><p>obstacles we suspect that photo registration cards will not </p><p>be ready ahead of 2003 elections, and may possibly never be </p><p>produced.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>CORRUPTION IN INEC </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) INEC is also being rocked by a bribery scandal </p><p>involving at least three top officials.  At the center of the </p><p>scandal is INEC\'s National Commissioner for Legal Matters, </p><p>Mrs. May Obegolu.  Obegolu and her son, Emeka, allegedly </p><p>collected a USDols 162,000 (Naira 21 million) "gratuity" from </p><p>a legal consortium, KDIO, to facilitate a Naira 124 million </p><p>contract.  KDIO had been contracted by INEC to monitor the </p><p>execution of INEC\'s USDols 27 million contract with a South </p><p>African firm for the supply and computerization of the voters </p><p>register.  The scandal, coming at a time when INEC\'s ability </p><p>to perform has already come into severe question, has created </p><p>a public outcry for Guobadia\'s resignation and the </p><p>dissolution of the commission. Ruling out resignation as an </p><p>option, Guobadia contends that INEC responded to the </p><p>allegations appropriately, and that the Commission is capable </p><p>of carrying out its mission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Police authorities, acting on the orders of President </p><p>Obasanjo, have reportedly detained Mrs. Obegolu, her son, and </p><p>two other INEC chiefs.  In response, Mrs. Obegolu filed a </p><p>complaint with the Independent Corrupt Practices and Related </p><p>Offenses Commission (CPC) accusing virtually every top INEC </p><p>member, including Guobadia, of corrupt practices.  The ICPC </p><p>has begun its investigation into this complaint and invited </p><p>all those accused to appear to defend themselves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>CONTINUING MISTRUST </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Perhaps the greatest challenge for INEC (and the most </p><p>difficult to overcome in the public\'s eyes) is the continual </p><p>questioning of its intentions.  As originally announced, the </p><p>aborted July registration effort was to be completed in a </p><p>five-day period.  During the August 7 meeting with the </p><p>Ambassador, the Chairman indicated that the registration </p><p>period had been extended to 10-14 days. When asked whether </p><p>resources were available for this longer period, the Chairman </p><p>firmly asserted that he was "confident the resources would be </p><p>provided."  Additionally, there have been many objections to </p><p>holding the exercise during the rainy season, which will not </p><p>end until October.  Voters in the South will be affected </p><p>since the ability to travel is severely hampered during this </p><p>time.  The agrarian North and Middle Belt are affected </p><p>because farmers are unable to leave their fields during this </p><p>critical time of harvest. Extending the time period addresses </p><p>only a small part of these concerns.  Some Northern leaders, </p><p>convinced that the North is being discriminated against by </p><p>the process, have called for an outright boycott of the </p><p>registration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Disputes over the method of registration have also </p><p>arisen.  The original plan was to complete a manual </p><p>registration locally to include the collection of personal </p><p>data, fingerprints and photographs.  This manual record was </p><p>to be used for local elections, while a computerized record </p><p>would be compiled from the manual data in time for State and </p><p>Federal elections. Additionally, complaints over the </p><p>complexity of the forms are common.  Test registrations have </p><p>been run and even well-educated, politically astute </p><p>registrants needed 6-8 minutes to complete the form. </p><p>Opponents to the form claim that the majority of the populace </p><p>will be overwhelmed by the process, unable to provide </p><p>accurate information and unwilling to endure what will </p><p>quickly become a tortuous process. The Arewa Consultative </p><p>Forum (ACF) has been particularly vocal in its criticism of </p><p>the registration form, claiming that the complex form will </p><p>disenfranchise the illiterate. They also fear that the voters </p><p>register will be used to infer census data, another </p><p>hot-button issue in the North.  Other Nigerians are taking </p><p>advantage of these issues to call for reforms and have </p><p>threatened an outright boycott of the registration process. </p><p>These efforts are usually couched in local terms, but are </p><p>based on the suspicion that INEC is attempting to manipulate </p><p>the outcome of elections as well as disadvantage the North. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Odds and Ends </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) INEC\'s independence has been strongly questioned, </p><p>particularly over party registration.  It has been accused of </p><p>supporting the PDP\'s bid to maintain the status quo by </p><p>refusing to allow the registration of new parties. Although </p><p>INEC did finally register three new parties in June, the </p><p>matter is still not settled.  An earlier court ruling in </p><p>favor of INEC\'s criteria for party qualification was </p><p>overturned in an appeal filed by unsuccessful applicants, </p><p>notably the National Conscience Party. During his meeting </p><p>with the Ambassador, the Chairman contended INEC had adhered </p><p>faithfully to the constitutional mandate to ensure "federal </p><p>character."  However, the Appeals Court disagreed that INEC </p><p>had correctly followed the precepts stated in the </p><p>constitution and the 2001 Electoral Law.  The Chairman </p><p>indicated that INEC would appeal the ruling to the Supreme </p><p>Court. Should INEC lose this case the dynamic could again </p><p>change radically. If upheld by the Supreme Court, the court\'s </p><p>decision could result in the registration of many  additional </p><p>parties, perhaps as many as the 33 that originally applied. </p><p>The advent of new parties would reset the schedule for voters </p><p>registration, and at the very least, further delay local </p><p>government elections.  The confusion that would result over </p><p>the configuration of the actual ballot paper and at the polls </p><p>in general could be substantial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Another danger, which the inability to complete the </p><p>voter registration exercise might give rise to is using the </p><p>1999 register for the 2003 election.  Due to the </p><p>constitutional mandate for a change of government by May 29, </p><p>2003, INEC could be pressured into proceeding with the best </p><p>available alternative: the old list. The resultant </p><p>disenfranchisement of millions of young voters who reached </p><p>majority in the interim has a great potential erupt. The </p><p>youth, who have a well-known propensity to express their </p><p>dissatisfaction with the Nigerian system through protests and </p><p>demonstrations, would undoubtedly seize the opportunity </p><p>presented by this slight to demonstrate their collective </p><p>displeasure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) A final area of contention is over the date of the </p><p>elections. The National Assembly is lobbying to hold the </p><p>elections in one day. The hope is that by holding the </p><p>election in one day, presidential and gubernatorial </p><p>candidates would be forced to concentrate on their own races </p><p>instead of trying to influence the National Assembly </p><p>contests. Notwithstanding the difficulties of the </p><p>registration process itself, Guobadia continues to resist </p><p>this option, claiming in this instance that it would create a </p><p>too-complicated ballot that would disadvantage illiterate </p><p>voters and that the logistics would be too difficult.  He </p><p>also questioned the legality and constitutionality of this </p><p>approach, but did not elaborate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) INEC has a critical role to play if the 2003 </p><p>elections are to be credible. First, INEC must be adequately </p><p>funded and technically competent. It must have the resources </p><p>to conduct voters registration and the elections. INEC has to </p><p>be more active in pressuring the Presidency to allot the </p><p>necessary funding. INEC must also have the ability and the </p><p>expertise to plan these exercises wisely and then implement </p><p>those plans.  No one expects the elections to be perfect but </p><p>they must be seen as fair; above all INEC must be seen as </p><p>impartial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Despite flaws in the 1999 exercise, Nigerians give </p><p>much higher marks to the Commission established by the </p><p>Abdulsalam Abubakar military government than to the current </p><p>edition of INEC. The irony that the military\'s Electoral </p><p>Commission and Guobadia\'s predecessor as Chairman were more </p><p>proficient, independent and effective has not been lost on </p><p>most Nigerian politicians. They suspect INEC\'s perceived </p><p>indifference and indecision are being orchestrated by the </p><p>Presidency to maximize Obasanjo\'s reelection prospects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) The current deep suspicion of INEC is unfortunate </p><p>but still redeemable. The upcoming voter registration </p><p>exercise will determine whether INEC and its Chairman can </p><p>restore their credibility and demonstrate to Nigerians that </p><p>the elections are not being manipulated and that the task is </p><p>not too big and complicated for this INEC to handle. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
