(U) SUMMARY.  Marshall Harry\'s death on March 5 is the </p><p>latest in a series of murders regarded by southern Nigerians </p><p>as political assassinations.  Harry engendered bitter </p><p>rivalries as a notorious power-player and strategist who </p><p>aimed to shift power to South-south minorities, including </p><p>Rivers State Governor Peter Odili.  (See also septel, </p><p>"HARRY\'S MURDER FLAMES PORT HARCOURT TENSIONS.")  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>A THORN IN ODILI\'S SIDE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Harry was among the most prominent elite of the </p><p>Kalabari southern ethnic minority.  His outspoken criticism </p><p>and political posturing for South-south ethnic groups put off </p><p>or threatened erstwhile allies in politics and business </p><p>alike.  Harry had ample, well-documented, public animosities. </p><p> In December 2001, after alleging that Odili was threatening </p><p>to kill him, police arrested Harry.  His younger brother (or </p><p>cousin) Ipalibo Harry, now the running mate to ANPP Rivers </p><p>State gubernatorial candidate Sergeant Awuse, posted 100,000 </p><p>naira for his bail a few days after the Civil Liberties </p><p>Organization protested the detention as a violation of </p><p>Harry\'s freedom of speech.  In February 2002, Harry told the </p><p>press, "If Odili returns as the governor of Rivers State in </p><p>2003, I will pack my bags and go into exile.  But I know he </p><p>will not win because he doesn\'t have what it takes to win the </p><p>election in Rivers State politics." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In contrast to the SSS perspective of the Harry-Odili </p><p>relationship mentioned in ref A, Odili displayed at least </p><p>once to poloffs his personal ire at the mere mention of </p><p>Harry\'s name.  In a 2002 meeting with Odili, Lagos Consul </p><p>General asked for his views on Marshall Harry and why Harry </p><p>had been imprisoned on his orders.  The Governor responded </p><p>angrily, demanding to know why the ConGen was wasting time </p><p>asking about "worthless criminals" such as Harry.  The </p><p>suggestion that Harry\'s detention had been noticed as a </p><p>possible human rights issue was enough to send Odili into a </p><p>tirade.  He said it was "proper" for police to detain Harry </p><p>since he had accused the Chief Executive of Rivers State of </p><p>plotting to kill hi.  This was a "serious accusation that </p><p>should not be brushed aside.  You cannot accuse the chief </p><p>executive of a state without proof.  It is a very serious </p><p>matter, and the police did the right thing interrogating him." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Harry\'s last days mixed public denunciations of Odili </p><p>with praises of ANPP presidential candidate General Mohammed </p><p>Buhari. In a press conference covered by the March 4 ThisDay </p><p>newspaper, Harry accused Odili of interfering with ANPP\'s </p><p>launch of Buhari\'s campaign and said he would take his </p><p>complaint directly to the Inspector General in Abuja.  He </p><p>felt victimized over the fee plus deposit of 7.5 million </p><p>naira asked of ANPP to secure the Port Harcourt Liberation </p><p>Stadium for Buhari\'s campaign launch on March 8; a few weeks </p><p>before, he claimed, the PDP had paid just 800,000 naira for </p><p>the same political venue.  In a formal complaint addressed on </p><p>March 3 to the Rivers State police commissioner, Harry </p><p>stated: "Since we started the preparation for the </p><p>presidential flag-off campaign, we have noticed a high spate </p><p>of arrest, intimidation, harassment, and maiming of our party </p><p>officials, candidates, and supporters by Odili\'s thugs with </p><p>the assistance of the Police" (ThisDay, "Harry Petitions </p><p>Police, Says Odili to Disrupt ANPP Rally, March 6, 2003).  In </p><p>the event that the police should "fail" to "protect lives and </p><p>property" of the ANPP, Harry said, "we do not lack the will </p><p>and capacity to protect our supporters."  He went on to </p><p>accuse the Rivers government of "buying police and army </p><p>uniforms as well as guns and ammunitions to equip their </p><p>standing army of murderers for the purpose of rigging the </p><p>forth-coming elections." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) In his last interview with The Guardian newspaper, </p><p>printed on March 6, Harry said, "Governor Odili is my friend. </p><p> I helped him to be there.  He is not my enemy.  He is the </p><p>one telling people that I am his enemy, but my challenges and </p><p>criticism are based on his bad governance.  He is not </p><p>transparent and he is not honest with the people of the </p><p>state.  I criticize him based on principle." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>A PIN ON BUHARI\'S LAPEL </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Harry, determined to bolster a Northern alliance with </p><p>South-South minorities, promoted Muhammadu Buhari as a rival </p><p>candidate to Obasanjo until his death.  Harry told the </p><p>Guardian: "It is the president\'s game to set the minorities </p><p>against the North.... We are political allies with the North. </p><p> Watch out, each time a northern president is on board, the </p><p>oil ministry is given to the southern minorities.  This time </p><p>Obasanjo gave us the minister of culture so that we should be </p><p>dancing around, and he still wants us to dance for another </p><p>four years.  I have told you that Buhari is down to earth, he </p><p>sees the problem of this country.  He knows the grave </p><p>injustice suffered by the minorities, he knows we feel </p><p>subjugated.  Buhari would not have done what Obasanjo did in </p><p>Odi.  The mere fact that people were agitating for a fair </p><p>deal out of oil derived from their area, which culminated in </p><p>the killing of some policemen, is it enough to sack a whole </p><p>village?  Buhari is a man who is coming to address the issues </p><p>affecting the minorities.  I am a minority.... and I believe </p><p>in his honest disposition." </p><p>7.  (U) "Primaries are a military creation to heat up the </p><p>system," he said.  "It is not a democratic attitude for an </p><p>undeveloped nation like ours.  If you are talking about </p><p>primaries in Britain and America, it is okay.  But in </p><p>Nigeria, the driving force to play politics is economic </p><p>power.  Nigerian politicians are driven by economic concern, </p><p>and are in politics to amass wealth.  In the developed </p><p>nations, it is to serve." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>HARRY:  THE LONELINESS OF HIS MINORITY POLITICS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Harry\'s political allies-turned-nemeses included most </p><p>of Nigeria\'s top power figures.  In 1999 he allegedly </p><p>prevented Sergeant Awuse (now his brother\'s running mate) </p><p>from obtaining the PDP\'s Rivers State gubernatorial ticket. </p><p>In December 2001, he told reporters that Odumegwu Ojukwu\'s </p><p>call for Igbo secession was "the cry of a madman."  While </p><p>chairing Rivers State\'s PDP chapter, he fought PDP\'s national </p><p>chairman Barnabas Gemade\'s attempt to extend his term in </p><p>power.  He founded the "Campaign for the Realization of a </p><p>South-South President 2003" (CRESSOP), despite its </p><p>implication that incumbent PDP President Obasanjo should not </p><p>be reelected to office. When CRESSOP failed to mobilize a </p><p>following, it was renamed the Rivers Democratic Movement </p><p>(RDM) and is now campaigning against Odili.  Harry and six </p><p>others (including Don Etiebet, now the ANPP national </p><p>chairman) left or were expelled from the PDP after a </p><p>protracted battle over the party\'s direction in 2002.  In </p><p>April 2002, he said, "Our position is very clear.  We believe </p><p>in the North.  The next president should come from the </p><p>South-south, come 2003.  We won\'t vote for Obasanjo."  In </p><p>July 2002, he accused former vice president Admiral Augustus </p><p>Aikhomu and Etiebet himself, arguably his main rival for a </p><p>position of power in the party, of hijacking the ANPP in the </p><p>South-South for their "hidden agenda."  In August 2002, he </p><p>called the impeachment proceedings against Obasanjo "long </p><p>overdue."  His pushing Buhari for the ANPP presidential </p><p>candidate "did not seem to go down well with aspirants like </p><p>Bekinbo Soberekon and Sam Agwor." Despite all his battles, he </p><p>said he had "never been in a party that failed before." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) So who killed Harry?  Since at least 2001, he had </p><p>been proclaiming publicly his Hobbesian fear of </p><p>assassination.  Theories vary from the elaborate to the </p><p>banal, including: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--"Fifth columnists attempting to create tension between PDP </p><p>and ANPP, hoping to destabilize the elections and pave the </p><p>way for the military to step in." </p><p>--Machiavellian frame up of Odili by an ANPP player, as Odili </p><p>would be the "obvious" suspect due to their prominent feuds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Disgruntled ANPP presidential aspirants blocked by Buhari, </p><p>whom Harry adamantly supported. </p><p>--Unauthorized assassination, such as by the Vikings cult </p><p>group in Rivers, which is popularly believed to have strong </p><p>ties to the Rivers State government.  The murder\'s Abuja </p><p>venue may have been a deliberate attempt to deflect attention </p><p>from politics in Rivers. </p><p>--None of his political enemies, but one from his prominent </p><p>business life instead. </p><p>--It was merely an armed robbery gone bad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Rivers State Attorney General Aleruchi Cookey-Gam </p><p>confirmed that police investigations "are quietly underway" </p><p>both in Rivers and in Abuja.  Because the murder took place </p><p>in Abuja, she expects any trial will likely take place there. </p><p> Toward the investigation\'s conclusion, she expects her </p><p>office will be asked for assistance regarding any arrested </p><p>suspects.  In the meantime, she anticipates that federal </p><p>authorities will lead the way. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
