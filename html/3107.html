<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001389 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: EDITORIALS SUPPORT AND CRITICIZE MUGABE </p><p>TRAVEL TO FAO MEETING IN ROME </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Editorials in the June 10 editions of the </p><p>   government-controlled daily "The Herald" and the </p><p>   independent daily "The Daily News" focus on Robert </p><p>   Mugabe\'s presence in Rome for the United Nations </p><p>   meeting on hunger.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   Under headline "Travel bans prove ineffective" </p><p>   the </p><p>   government-controlled daily "The Herald" dismisses </p><p>   travel restrictions against Robert Mugabe and his </p><p>   government as meaningless.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>   "Despite the imposition of travel sanctions against </p><p>   President Mugabe, government officials and other </p><p>   Zimbabwean business people by the United States and </p><p>   the European Union (EU), the Zimbabwean leader and </p><p>   his entourage have once again managed to travel to </p><p>   a European destination without any hindrance.  This </p><p>   puts to shame political upstarts and Uncle Toms who </p><p>   were gleefully celebrating the imposition of the </p><p>   travel ban against Zimbabwe\'s leaders and </p><p>   entrepreneurs. . .  The failure of the travel ban </p><p>   has also exposed another fallacy that the US and EU </p><p>   were going to seize foreign assets of President </p><p>   Mugabe and his officials.  Several months after </p><p>   this announcement, nothing has been found despite </p><p>   the celebrated international intelligence network </p><p>   of the Americans, British and other Western super </p><p>   powers. </p><p> </p><p>   "If President Mugabe was such an abomination to the </p><p>   international notion of civil liberties, democracy </p><p>   and human rights how come his two international </p><p>   visits to the US and Italy have not caused any stir </p><p>   in these two countries?  We have not seen the </p><p>   public outrage against his visits unlike that which </p><p>   was attracted by the American President and British </p><p>   prime minister in some of their travels outside </p><p>   their own countries, which saw thousands of people </p><p>   taking to the streets in protest.  Maybe it is now </p><p>   time to turn the tables against those who have been </p><p>   fighting for the isolation of Zimbabwe, the </p><p>   imposition of sanctions, among other things meant </p><p>   to bring suffering on the people.  Why should they </p><p>   continue to enjoy international travel to advocate </p><p>   evil against their own people and nothing is done </p><p>   to hold them accountable.  No other country would </p><p>   tolerate such nonsense and Zimbabwe should be no </p><p>   exception." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "The Daily News" editorial blames the Mugabe </p><p>   government for the food crisis.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>   ". . .The government (of Zimbabwe) is the chief </p><p>   architect of the food shortage, but the tragedy is </p><p>   that it is unwilling to see or acknowledge its </p><p>   authorship of the crisis.  Instead, it prefers to </p><p>   blame the weather and an alleged conspiracy by </p><p>   commercial farmers. . .   By being in Rome, Mugabe </p><p>   is demonstrating the futility of the \'smart\' </p><p>   sanctions against himself and his government, but </p><p>   he is also saying he can create a crisis and leave </p><p>   the international community to assume </p><p>   responsibility for his actions. . .  If the FAO </p><p>   summit produces pledges food aid for starving </p><p>   Zimbabweans, it must be on condition that non- </p><p>   governmental organizations - and not the </p><p>   government - be involved in its distribution. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
