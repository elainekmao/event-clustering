<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000823 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF AND INL </p><p>DOJ FOR ICITAP-BARR/BEINHART </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/13/2017 </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, SNAR, ASEC, PGOV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CLEANING HOUSE AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 708 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Charge d\'affaires Timothy D. Andrews for reason </p><p>1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The March 6 sacking of Police Inspector </p><p>General Musiliu Smith and his seven Deputies (DIGs) sent a </p><p>clear message of reform from the Presidency.  Through his </p><p>newly minted Police Service Commission, the President is also </p><p>challenging the police old guard by reaching below the seven </p><p>DIGs he dismissed to find the new IG - a decision based on </p><p>merit rather than seniority - and bringing up a new batch of </p><p>second-tier managers.   This overdue move may presage </p><p>much-needed reforms within the NPF.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Out with the Old . . . </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a rare March 6 meeting of the National </p><p>Police Council (which last met in June 1999), President </p><p>Obasanjo discussed the administration of the Police Force </p><p>with the country\'s 36 governors and the group agreed on the </p><p>dismissal of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Musiliu Smith </p><p>for his mismangement of the Force; he was present at the </p><p>three-hour meeting and was fired at its conclusion.  Smith </p><p>reportedly was caught off-guard but cleared out his office </p><p>within hours.  Obasanjo announced his new appointment for the </p><p>IGP position immediately after announcing Smith\'s dismissal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) While adjourning for a private meeting with Police </p><p>Service Commission Chairman Okeke, President Obasanjo asked </p><p>Governors Makarfi (Kaduna) and Nnamani (Enugu) to represent </p><p>the Police Council in breaking the news to the media waiting </p><p>outside.  Speaking extemporaneously, Makarfi declared that </p><p>"in carrying out the planned reorganization and revamping (of </p><p>the NPF) the government had considered it necessary to make </p><p>fundamental changes in the administration of the police </p><p>force."  Makarfi also stated that the NPF had always been </p><p>given all funding it had requested, even more than its </p><p>budgetary requests.  He noted that if the funding was not </p><p>adequate, the managers of the NPF should have pressed for </p><p>additional funding, which they did not do.  (Comment: Many </p><p>observers see Makarfi\'s comments as a hint at corruption </p><p>among Smith and his Deputies - withholding federal funds </p><p>designated for rank-and-file salaries and allowances.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>. . . In with the New </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The new Inspector General, Tafa Balogun, was until </p><p>March 6 the Assistant Inspector General for the Kano Zone - </p><p>one of twelve police zones (each comprised of three states) </p><p>in the country.  By most accounts, he is a respected leader </p><p>and is considered a reformer. According to the PSC Chairman, </p><p>who has had several meetings with him already, Balogun is </p><p>thoughtful, a "listener" and able to handle dissent.  The </p><p>seven new DIGs, including popular former Lagos Police </p><p>Commissioner Mike Okiro, are cut of the same cloth. </p><p>According to Okeke,these seven were picked by the PSC and </p><p>approved by the President during the private meeting with </p><p>Okeke after the National Police Council Meeting.  These DIGs </p><p>reflect the "federal character of Nigeria," with each of the </p><p>six geo-political zones represented (one represented by two </p><p>DIGs). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The new Agent of Change on the Block </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Behind the scenes of this major reshuffle is the new </p><p>Police Service Commission (PSC).  Enshrined in Nigeria\'s </p><p>constitution, the PSC has been moribund since 1989 but was </p><p>re-inaugurated in November 2001, after passage of the Police </p><p>Service Commission Act in June 2001.  Comprised of seven </p><p>members including a Chairman, the PSC is explictly charged </p><p>with sole authority for the appointment, promotion and </p><p>discipline of all Police personnel except the Inspector </p><p>General (who is appointed or dismissed by the President). </p><p>The Commission must have representatives from key sectors of </p><p>society: women; business, media, and human rights NGOs and </p><p>must include retired senior judge and a retired senior police </p><p>officer.  The Chairman and Commission members are appointed </p><p>by the President for a term of five years and can only be </p><p>removed by a two thirds vote of the National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The members of the PSC appear eager to push the </p><p>Commission\'s mandate for reform aggressively.  In discussions </p><p>with emboffs, Chairman Okeke and members Ayo Obe (head of </p><p>Civil Liberties Organization) and Aisha Abdulquadri (lecturer </p><p>at University of Abuja) have  mapped out a rough plan to </p><p>reform the behavior of the police and make them accountable </p><p>to Nigeria society.  Answering only to the President, the </p><p>group can oversee the Inspector General in a way the Minister </p><p>of Police Affairs cannot.  According to Okeke, the President </p><p>wants the new Commission to have real power as an agent of </p><p>change and he has shown this trust by supporting Okeke\'s </p><p>choices in firing Smith\'s Deputies and appointing new DIGs. </p><p>Okeke and his fellow commissioners will next month be given </p><p>their first budget with which they plan to build an agency </p><p>with a staff of 300-400 in order to carry out its mandate </p><p>adequately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Precariously Perched: The Police Affairs Minister </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>7. (C) Bets are now on over how much longer Police Affairs </p><p>Minister Steven Akiga - or his entire Ministry - will last. </p><p>Akiga performed poorly in responding to January 31-February 1 </p><p>police strike, showing little sensitivity to the real </p><p>grievances of the striking rank- and-file and instead </p><p>blasting them as "mutinous" and vowing to prosecute all who </p><p>participated.  He was further discredited when his belated </p><p>pledge to release one billion naira to cover immediate salary </p><p>and allowance arrears was not realized.  According to some </p><p>observers, Akiga feels threatened by the new PSC, which has </p><p>well defined powers in contrast to his vaguely articulated </p><p>mandate, which appears limited to some control over police </p><p>budgets.  He has tried to control the PSC through access to </p><p>budgets and access to the President, but is losing.  In a </p><p>recent meeting with the President at which the PSC was </p><p>discussing its start-up, the PSC Chairman noted that he had </p><p>written the President a letter on an important matter.  Akiga </p><p>(also present) itnerjected that all PSC correspondence to the </p><p>President should go through him.  According to PSC members, </p><p>the President scolded Akiga, "Shut up! He can write me </p><p>directly."  Chairman Okeke reportedly then offered Akiga a </p><p>copy of the PSC Act so that he could determine the </p><p>Commission\'s authority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Talking Tough in Lagos </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) Balogun made a symbolic March 10-11 pilgrimage to </p><p>Lagos, the city whose name is synonymous with rampant crime. </p><p>He visited various police formations, promoted eight </p><p>policemen (among them a constable promoted to corporal, </p><p>ostensibly for exhibiting courage in asking the new IG a </p><p>question), and unveiled his agenda to reform the police and </p><p>tackle insecurity.  His pep talk -- widely reported in most </p><p>Nigerian dailies -- included promises to review the condition </p><p>and well-being of the force and to revise promotion </p><p>guidelines.  He also warned against corruption and exhorted </p><p>the police to cultivate a more positive image in the eyes of </p><p>a public long suspicious of their motives.  He promised as </p><p>well to pick up the pace in the investigation of the </p><p>assassination of Attorney General Bola Ige. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(SBU) What made the headlines, however, was Balogun\'s tough </p><p>talk on crime in Lagos.  In blunt terms, Balogun ordered </p><p>police to give armed robbers "fire for fire" when under </p><p>attack.  When facing armed criminals the new IG told police </p><p>"not to waste time in firing back, don\'t wait for any order </p><p>from anywhere."  (Note: RSO/Lagos sources report not less </p><p>than two dozen policemen -- and perhaps as many as 50 -- have </p><p>been gunned down by armed gangs in Lagos over the last month. </p><p>End Note) He also suggested the use of tear gas and other </p><p>crowd control materials as deterrents to violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.(SBU) We asked Civil Liberties Organization Executive </p><p>Director Abdul Oroh for his interpretation of Balogun\'s </p><p>forceful message on crime.  Oroh believes Balogun\'s remarks </p><p>were intended to boost the morale of the beleaguered Lagos </p><p>force.  Balogun\'s "fight fire with fire" message was an </p><p>emotional reaction to the recent spate of attacks by armed </p><p>robbers and police on the Ikeja airport road between the </p><p>domestic and international terminals, occurred March 10 only </p><p>an hour after Balogun arrived in Lagos. According to one </p><p>ConGen Lagos source, the gun battle ended when the police ran </p><p>out of ammunition and fled. End Note.) But Oroh noted that </p><p>such remarks, particularly if they do not represent a shift </p><p>in policy, could send the wrong signal.  Nigerian police are </p><p>not properly trained, he stressed, and should not be given an </p><p>implied green light to shoot suspected criminals with </p><p>impunity.  Oroh said that the human rights community will </p><p>monitor such developments, though he was confident that the </p><p>new police leadership and the PSC would institute many of the </p><p>reforms needed to improve police performance and </p><p>professionalism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Strike That Wasn\'t </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>11.(C) Comment:  March 11 passed quietly throughout Nigeria </p><p>despite earlier pledges by groups representing rank-and-file </p><p>policemen to strike over continued salary and allowance </p><p>arrearages.  The sacking of IGP Smith and his Deputies </p><p>appears to have been the major reason the crisis was averted, </p><p>though continued discontent among the enlisted police staff </p><p>will only dissipate when the billions of naira (tens of </p><p>millions of dollars) are released to cover the arrears in </p><p>wages and benefits.  For now, the police are willing to trust </p><p>the new IG to see this through. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.(C) Comment Cont\'d:  Smith had clearly lost the </p><p>President\'s confidence with his botched handling of the </p><p>January 31 police strike.  Under his three year tenure the </p><p>police have continued to suffer from inadequate or irregular </p><p>pay and poor discipline while reforms Smith promised in 1999 </p><p>were never implemented.  His departure and that of his </p><p>Deputies - who many see as more responsible for the sad state </p><p>of NPF affairs -- appears a victory for reformers in general </p><p>and the Police Service Commission in particular.  The </p><p>Commission was already butting heads with a recalcitrant </p><p>Smith who would not give up usurped powers to appoint and </p><p>discipline subordinates.  The new IG appears much more of a </p><p>team player and more open-minded.  The transition paints a </p><p>much brighter future for INL\'s Police Reform project which </p><p>will need strong advocates of reform within and outside the </p><p>NPF.  The PSC will likely become a major partner in this </p><p>effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
