WFP\'S INTERNATIONAL CARGO SURVEYOR IN KARACHI SUGGESTS </p><p>THAT THE 1965 AFGHAN TRANSIT TRADE AGREEMENT BE AMENDED TO </p><p>INCLUDE PORT BIN QASIM. THIS MODERN PAKISTANI PORT FACILITY, </p><p>BUILT IN THE MID-1970S, COULD HELP FACILITATE MOVEMENT OF </p><p>MATERIAL FOR THE AFGHAN RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. USMISSION HUMANITARIAN ATTACHE TIM LAVELLE SPOKE WITH JAY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02030  01 OF 02  260820Z </p><p>KOTECHA (FINANCE DIRECTOR) OF THE INTERNATIONAL FORWARDING </p><p>AGENCY (PVT) LTD (IFA), BASED IN KARACHI, WHO WAS ATTENDING </p><p>THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM\'S SECOND ANNUAL SHIPPING CONFERENCE </p><p>HELD IN ROME APRIL 18-19. IFA HAS BEEN WFP\'S GENERAL </p><p>SUPERINTENDENT (SURVEYOR) IN KARACHI FOR THE PAST 32 YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>3. KOTECHA BRIEFED ON ASPECTS OF THE AFGHAN TRANSIT TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT SIGNED ON MARCH 2, 1965 BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF </p><p>PAKISTAN AND THE KINGDOM OF AFGHANISTAN FOR </p><p>REGULATION OF TRAFFIC IN TRANSIT FROM PAKISTAN TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN. IN THIS AGREEMENT, ONLY KARACHI PORT WAS </p><p>MENTIONED AS A PAKISTANI PORT POINT OF ENTRY, WITH NO </p><p>FLEXIBILITY FOR INCLUSION AT A FUTURE DATE OF ADDITIONAL </p><p>PORTS DEVELOPED ALONG THE PAKISTANI COAST LINE. </p><p> </p><p>4. IN THE EXTANT AGREEMENT, THERE ARE TWO PREREQUISITES FOR </p><p>ALLOWING A PORT TO HANDLE AFGHAN TRANSIT TRADE CARGO, WHICH </p><p>ARE: </p><p> </p><p>A) SEPARATE SHED(S) TO STORE THE CARGO, AND </p><p>B) A RAILWAY LINK FROM THE PORT TO THE DESIGNATED PAKISTANI </p><p>BORDER EXIT POINTS OF PESHAWAR AND CHAMAN. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>PORT BIN QASIM </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. AS PER KOTECHA, PORT BIN QASIM CAME INTO OPERATION IN MID </p><p>1970\'S FOR BULK CARGO, AND NOW HAS A MODERN TERMINAL FOR </p><p>CONTAINERIZED VESSELS - CAPABLE OF HANDLING MOTHER VESSELS </p><p>INSTEAD OF FEEDER VESSELS. WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE PORT, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02030  01 OF 02  260820Z </p><p>THERE ARE AMPLE AREAS AVAILABLE, WHICH COULD BE ALLOCATED </p><p>FOR EXCLUSIVE HANDLING OF AFGHAN TRANSIT TRADE CARGO. IN </p><p>KOTECHA\'S VIEW, FOR THE REBUILDING OF AFGHANISTAN IT IS </p><p>ADVISABLE TO HAVE A SECOND PORT (SUCH AS BIN QASIM) TO </p><p>HANDLE AFGHAN TRANSIT TRADE. BIN QASIM MEETS THE TWO </p><p>PREREQUISITES MENTIONED ABOVE. NOTE: WFP HAS EXTENSIVELY </p><p>USED THIS PORT FOR BULK GRAIN SHIPMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 13 </p><p>YEARS. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>6. KOTECHA OPINED FURTHER THAT THE FACILITIES PRESENTLY </p><p>AVAILABLE AT KARACHI PORT WOULD BE HEAVILY STRETCHED TO </p><p>ALONE HANDLE THE ANTICIPATED INFLUX OF SHIP CARGO FOR </p><p>AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>7. IF THE AFGHAN TRANSIT TRADE AGREEMENT CONTINUES, </p><p>USMISSION FEELS THAT THE PORT BIN QASIM OPTION MIGHT BE </p><p>PROFITABLY EXPLORED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
