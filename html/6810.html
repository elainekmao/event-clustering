SUMMARY:  THE WAR IN IRAQ, AN ALLEGED U.S. DOUBLE STANDARD ON </p><p>POWS, CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, AND THE "OUR PEOPLE IN IRAQ" CAMPAIGN </p><p>DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA.  IN AN "AL KHALEEJ" ARTICLE, DR. </p><p>HASSAN MADAN ALLEGED A DOUBLE STANDARD IN U.S. POLICY TOWARDS </p><p>POWS.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "THE DILEMMA AND FEAR," AN "AL BAYAN" </p><p>EDITORIAL NOTES THAT U.S. FORCES ARE PLANNING TO USE BANNED </p><p>WEAPONS, WHILE ANOTHER COLUMNIST COMPARES PRESIDENT BUSH TO WW2 </p><p>NAZI LEADERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DUBAI TV FINISHED A 12-HOUR TELETHON EARLY MORNING 3/26 AFTER </p><p>RAISING NEARLY 49 MILLION AED ($14 MILLION) FOR HUMANITARIAN AID </p><p>TO IRAQIS, FEATURING PROMINENT EMIRATIS AS WELL AS EGYPTIAN AND </p><p>SYRIAN FILM STARS.  ALL VOICED STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE WAR, WITH </p><p>ONE UAE OFFICIAL CALLING ON " THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO STOP </p><p>THIS AGGRESSION" AND ON "THE AMERICAN AND BRITISH AMBASSADORS TO </p><p>REPORT THE FEELINGS OF THE PUBLIC HONESTLY." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "THE CASUALTIES OF WAR," DUBAI-BASED </p><p>ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY "GULF NEWS" EDITORIALIZED 3/26: </p><p> </p><p>"... YET SOME DAYS LATER, POCKETS OF RESISTANCE ARE STILL BEING </p><p>MET AND COUNTERED WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY.  EXPECTATIONS OF HORDES </p><p>OF GLEEFUL IRAQIS WELCOMING THE \'LIBERATING TROOPS\' WITH BOUQUETS </p><p>AND SWEETMEATS HAVE FAILED TO MATERIALISE, AS HAVE THE SO-CALLED </p><p>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION ALLEGEDLY HELD BY THE IRAQIS ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "THE DILEMMA AND FEAR," DUBAI-BASED </p><p>BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 3/26: </p><p> </p><p>"... DURING THIS DILEMMA (FOR THE U.S. MILITARY), IT IS NOT FAR </p><p>FROM TRUTH THAT U.S. FORCES MIGHT USE \'DESTRUCTIVE METHODS\' </p><p>OUTSIDE NORMAL WAR PLANNING.  SOME REPORTERS MENTIONED YESTERDAY </p><p>THAT THE U.S. FORCES USED CLUSTER BOMBS ON BASRA ... WHAT IS </p><p>FRIGHTENING IS THAT THE AMERICANS HAVE BEGUN TO CONSIDER USING </p><p>MILITARILY BANNED MATERIAL, AND IF THAT HAPPENS, THE \'SHOCK AND </p><p>AWE\' WILL NOT ONLY HIT IRAQ AND THE ARABS BUT THE WORLD AS A </p><p>WHOLE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENTING ON THE U.S. PLANS TO REMOLD THE REGION, SHARJAH- </p><p>BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 3/26: </p><p> </p><p>"... IN PALESTINE, A WAR OF LIQUIDATION HAS BEEN WAGED USING </p><p>AMERICAN WEAPONS.  IN IRAQ, AN AMERICAN-BRITISH WAR OF </p><p>LIQUIDATION IS BEING WAGED AGAINST THE IRAQI PEOPLE USING ISRAELI </p><p>WEAPONS ... THE REGION IS BEING REMOLDED WITH ARAB BLOOD WHILE </p><p>ARABS ARE WATCHING AND COUNTING THE MISSILES THAT FALL ON IRAQI </p><p>PEOPLE, JUST AS BEFORE WITH THE MISSILES THAT FELL AND ARE STILL </p><p>FALLING ON THE PALESTINIANS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  DESCRIBING THE IMAGE BUSH PAINTS FOR THE U.S., UAE COLUMNIST </p><p>AYSHA SULTAN WROTE IN "AL BAYAN" 3/25: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE PICTURE THAT PRESIDENT BUSH DRAWS FOR THE U.S. IS AN </p><p>EXTREMELY UGLY IMAGE OF A COWBOY DRUNK WITH THE IDEA OF </p><p>TYRANNICAL POWER.  THIS HAS LED HIM TO IMAGINE THAT HE CAN DO </p><p>WHATEVER HE WANTS TO WHOMEVER.  AMERICANS THINK THAT THE ARAB </p><p>WORLD AND IN PARTICULAR, THE ISLAMIC WORLD, ARE REGIONS INHABITED </p><p>BY SAVAGE ARAB TERRORISTS, WHO NEED TO BE ELIMINATED TO REALIZE </p><p>THE PROPHECY AND STABILITY OF AMERICA AND THE WELL-BEING OF </p><p>AMERICANS ... OH PEOPLE OF IRAQ:  YOU ARE TURNING, ON BEHALF OF </p><p>THE (ARAB) NATION, A DANGEROUS CORNER; AN IDEA CONFRONTING A </p><p>TANK; CULTURE CONFRONTING DEATH; CIVILIZATION CONFRONTING A </p><p>TOMAHAWK; AND A HUMAN BEING FACING EXPULSION.  YOU ARE STANDING </p><p>LIKE AN ARROW IN THE DESERT, LIKE PALESTINE AND BEIRUT BEFORE </p><p>YOU, AND JUST AS OTHER CAPITALS WILL STAND IN THE FUTURE ..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  ALLEGING A U.S. DOUBLE STANDARD IN THE TREATMENT OF POWS, UAE </p><p>COLUMNIST DR.HASSAN MADAN WROTE IN "AL KHALEEJ" 3/26: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE U.S. IN PARTICULAR SHOULD BE THE LAST TO DISCUSS RESPECT </p><p>OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION REGARDING POWS.  THE U.S. IGNORED AND IS </p><p>STILL IGNORING ALL THE OBJECTIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>AND HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE TREATMENT OF THE ARABS AND </p><p>NON-ARAB PRISONERS SHIPPED TO GUANTANAMO BAY IN CUBA.  THEIR </p><p>TREATMENT IS A HUMILIATION OF ALL HUMAN DIGNITY ..." </p><p> </p><p>8  COMPARING GEORGE BUSH TO NAZI LEADER HERMAN GOERING, A </p><p>COLUMNIST NICKNAMED ABU KHALDOUN WROTE IN "AL BAYAN" 3/26: </p><p> </p><p>"... DURING THE TRIAL OF THE NAZI LEADER HERMAN GOERING (HITLER\'S </p><p>DEPUTY), HE WAS ASKED: DID THE PEOPLE OF GERMANY WANT THE WAR? </p><p>HE ANSWERED: THE NORMAL MAN IN THE STREET AND ALL PEOPLE OF ALL </p><p>NATIONS DO NOT WANT WAR, BUT IT IS THE POLITICAL LEADERS WHO </p><p>DECIDE A NATION\'S POLICY ... PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH, IN HIS </p><p>CAMPAIGN TO PREPARE FOR THE INVASION OF IRAQ, FOLLOWED THIS SAME </p><p>METHOD REVEALED BY THE NAZI LEADER IN THE NEUREMBERG TRIAL.  HE </p><p>ANNOUNCED FROM THE FIRST DAY OF MOBILIZATION: \'WHOEVER IS NOT </p><p>WITH US IS AGAINST US\' AND CREATED A SITUATION OF ANXIETY AND </p><p>FEAR AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ..." </p><p> </p><p>9  MARIAM ABDULLAH WROTE IN HER DAILY COLUMN IN "AL-BAYAN" 3/26 </p><p> </p><p>"... IRAQ\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHALLENGE (OF THE WAR) WAS THE </p><p>GREATEST AND MOST WONDERFUL OPTION THAT HELPED TO RESTORE PART OF </p><p>OUR WOUNDED DIGNITY AND ALLOWED US A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A </p><p>VITAL PART OF OUR (ARAB) ENTITY RESISTING, FACE THE AGGRESSORS, </p><p>AND REJECT A DRINK FROM THE CUP OF HUMILIATION ..." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
