<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L GUATEMALA 001375 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/OAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, GT, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA MAKES COUNTER REQUEST ON OAS CANDIDATES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 141801 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 1340 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Robert E. Copley for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Per ref A, following up on our previous demarche (ref </p><p>B) and diplomatic note, PolOff discussed post-specific and </p><p>Central American points with Sylvia Corado, Director for </p><p>Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign Ministry on May 28. </p><p>Corado expressed appreciation for our favorable view of Dr. </p><p>Altolaguirre\'s candidacy and pressed for a commitment of U.S. </p><p>support.  Corado took careful note, without commenting, of </p><p>our view that the Salvadoran candidate is also well qualified </p><p>and of our hope that both the Guatemalan and Salvadoran </p><p>candidates will join us on the IACHR.  Corado then repeated </p><p>the position that Guatemala would vote according to the </p><p>qualifications of the candidates, adding that no decisions </p><p>had been made.  PolOff reviewed the qualifications of the </p><p>U.S. candidates with her. </p><p> </p><p>3 (C) Corado then asked if the U.S. would be willing to </p><p>publicly express support for Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia, </p><p>Guatemala\'s candidate for the Inter-American Court of Human </p><p>Rights.  Told that the decision would have to be made in </p><p>Washington, Corado hinted that our support for either of </p><p>Guatemala\'s candidates would likely result in Guatemalan </p><p>support for the U.S. candidates.  Corado added that </p><p>Laguardia\'s candidacy was Guatemala\'s priority.  Laguardia </p><p>will accompany the Guatemalan delegation to the OAS General </p><p>Assembly. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Action request.  Please advise how post should respond </p><p>to the GOG\'s request for support of their candidates at the </p><p>OASGA. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
