(SBU) The long awaited IMF mission (originally planned </p><p>for February 2002 and delayed several times to give the </p><p>Maduro team time to understand the inherited fiscal problems </p><p>and develop plans to address them) will arrive on November </p><p>4.  The mission is scheduled to conduct an Article IV review </p><p>and discuss the potential outlines of a new three-year </p><p>Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program.  Both the IMF </p><p>resident rep and the Central Bank President have confirmed </p><p>that the key issue is the uncontrolled increase in public </p><p>sector salaries. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Fund will push hard for introduction and </p><p>passage of a comprehensive civil service law that would </p><p>provide the legal framework for having a sensible wage </p><p>policy.  Along with this provision, the IMF would like to </p><p>see the GOH provide a plan for reducing the percentage that </p><p>central government salaries represent of GDP (this has risen </p><p>from 45 percent of GDP in 1997 to an estimated 67 percent in </p><p>2002).  The IMF will also push for better tax collection and </p><p>elimination of tax exemptions to help reduce the fiscal </p><p>deficit in the short-run (see reftel for description of the </p><p>problems in the country\'s tax policy). </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The IMF is emphasizing the civil service law (which </p><p>was a prominent commitment in the GOH\'s earlier IMF program </p><p>as well, but was never implemented) for two important </p><p>reasons.  First, the uncontrolled increase in the central </p><p>government wage bill is leading to a fiscal imbalance of </p><p>eventually crisis proportions.  Second, the country badly </p><p>needs institutional strengthening throughout the government </p><p>and this can only be achieved with a strong legal framework </p><p>creating a career civil service.  The Interamerican </p><p>Development Bank and World Bank reps here agree with the </p><p>view that the Civil Service Law is a key policy change </p><p>needed to control government expenditures and increase GOH </p><p>effectiveness. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) We understand from other members of the donor </p><p>community that the IMF mission may also push the GOH to </p><p>develop a more realistic plan of social projects, as </p><p>outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). </p><p>This would require revision of the PRSP (which has already </p><p>been approved by Congress) with extensive consultation with </p><p>civil society.  The government clearly does not have the </p><p>financial resources to comply with its commitments in the </p><p>PRSP, in the current macroeconomic climate and without HIPC </p><p>debt relief. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Structural reforms, such as liberalization of the </p><p>energy and telecommunications sectors, are not currently </p><p>being discussed in the context of the IMF program.  The Fund </p><p>has decided to focus strictly on macroeconomic policy. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The fragile financial sector continues to be of </p><p>great importance in Honduras, but the GOH has complied with </p><p>most of the conditions in the previous IMF plan and is </p><p>acting responsibly in addressing this problem.  The World </p><p>Bank and IDB are continuing their work in the sector, </p><p>including a full assessment of the financial sector, on-site </p><p>reviews of each bank with subsequent development of action </p><p>plans to ensure full compliance with regulatory </p><p>requirements, and improvement in the legal framework to </p><p>allow for strengthened supervision in the non-bank </p><p>institutions. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The IMF appears to be impressed with the political </p><p>will in Maduro\'s team (primarily Banking Commission </p><p>President Ana Cristina Pereira and Central Bank President </p><p>Maria Elena Mondragon) to strengthen financial sector </p><p>supervision and compliance with the Basel accords. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The passage of legislation in July to reduce the </p><p>cap on related lending from 120 percent of capital to 20 </p><p>percent of capital within three years was viewed favorably </p><p>by the IFIs.  The decision to take over two banks in the </p><p>spring (instead of liquidating them) was supported by the </p><p>IMF because it reduced the up-front cost to the government. </p><p>The Fund also was supportive of the decision to extend the </p><p>100 percent deposit insurance for another three years, to </p><p>avoid a run on the smaller banks. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
