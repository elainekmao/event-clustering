This TIP conference was reported in reftel.  The </p><p>original and attached leaflet will be pouched to G/TIP, Attn: </p><p>Ambassador Nancy Ely-Raphel.  The text of the letter follows. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>Nigeria </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>June 6, 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>General Colin Powell </p><p>Secretary of State </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>State Department </p><p>U.S.A. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Invitation to Attend an International Summit on Human </p><p>Trafficking, Child Abuse, Labour and Slavery holding from </p><p>01-03 August 2002, Abuja, Nigeria </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I wish to recall the various global efforts made towards the </p><p>eradication of human trafficking, culminating in the adoption </p><p>of the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish </p><p>Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.  The </p><p>increasing incidence of human trafficking, child labour, </p><p>child abuse, slavery and, generally, organized crimes, </p><p>require collaborative network involving governments at the </p><p>national and international levels, international </p><p>organisations, non-governmental organisations and the civil </p><p>society.  This has far reaching negative repercussions on the </p><p>economic, political, socio-cultural and moral well being of </p><p>our nations, particularly, the developing countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. In order to sensitise the international community on the </p><p>evils of this inhuman trade, the Government of the Federal </p><p>Republic of Nigeria, under the leadership of President </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo, is organising a three-day international </p><p>Summit on the subject, to dispassionately look into the </p><p>phenomenon of human trafficking, child labour, abuse and </p><p>slavery.  This would afford the Participants to critically </p><p>evaluate the problems associated with the phenomenon with a </p><p>view to engendering adequate global strategies to eliminate </p><p>the trade.  This is reflected in the theme of the Summit: </p><p>"Combating Human Trafficking, Child Labour and Slavery </p><p>through International Cooperation and Legislation."  The </p><p>Summit is scheduled to take place from 01-03 August 2002, at </p><p>the International Conference Center, Abuja, Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The Summit has, among others, the following objectives: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(i) Identify and examine the magnitude, nature, patterns and </p><p>manifestations of human trafficking, child labour, child </p><p>abuse and slavery; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(ii) Examine the adverse implications of human trafficking </p><p>and child abuse on sustainable human development; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(iii) Exchange ideas and experience with Participants from </p><p>other countries and International Organisations, with a view </p><p>to developing national and regional frameworks for </p><p>international cooperation in combating the crime; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(iv) Develop strategies for the effective and efficient </p><p>prevention, control and punishment of the offenders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. On behalf of the President and People of the Federal </p><p>Republic of Nigeria, I have the honour to invite you to </p><p>attend and participate at the Summit.  Four representatives, </p><p>made up of the Head of State/Government, a Minister, and two </p><p>Experts are expected to attend the Summit from your country. </p><p>The Nigerian Government would extend hospitality to the Head </p><p>of State/Government and the Minister only. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The attached leaflet will provide an insight and relevant </p><p>background information on the Summit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Please accept the assurances of my highest esteem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(signed) </p><p>Sule Lamido </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs </p><p>and Chairman of the Summit Organising Committee </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
