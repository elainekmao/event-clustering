Cowan expressed </p><p>appreciation for the information, saying she frequently </p><p>receives inquiries from Canadians who are convinced the U.S. </p><p>is violating the human rights of the five Cuban spies. Cowan </p><p>said a lot of misinformation about the case has been spread </p><p>by a pro-Castro group called the Canadian-Cuban Friendship </p><p>Association, which refers to the prisoners as the "Miami </p><p>Five."  This group is seeking to organize a visit to Canada </p><p>by family members of the prisoners, in an effort to gain </p><p>sympathy from Canadians for their situation. Comment: Should </p><p>such a visit occur, and if it receives much attention from </p><p>the Canadian press, post recommends press guidance be </p><p>prepared setting out, in detail, the full due process </p><p>provided by the American justice system in this case. End </p><p>comment. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
