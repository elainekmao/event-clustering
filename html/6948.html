<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001883 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 19 (3/30 1500 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reason 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Embassy is operating on a normal schedule March </p><p>30.  Consular services are open.  Activities at the American </p><p>Language Center remain suspended, and there is only </p><p>restricted activity by FSNs at the Peace Corps office. </p><p>Movements of American staff remain restricted. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The official Jordanian news service Petra reported </p><p>that 50,000 persons took part in an anti-war demonstration in </p><p>the northern city of Irbid on March 29.  PSD sources reported </p><p>a significantly smaller event involving approximately 7,000 </p><p>people with no violence or arrests.  According to PSD </p><p>sources, political speeches in Jebel al-Nuzha near Marka </p><p>airport in Amman attracted around 10,000 people, with no </p><p>violence or arrests.  Small non-violent demonstrations were </p><p>also reported in Wehdat and Baq\'aa refugee camps. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Demonstrations in support of Palestinian Land Day </p><p>and against the war in Iraq are expected today at Yarmouk </p><p>University and Jordan University of Science and Technology </p><p>(JUST) in Irbid, and at University of Jordan and the </p><p>Professional Associations building in the Shmeisani area of </p><p>Amman. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Mr. Nate Thayer, a reporter expelled from Iraq called </p><p>today to provide information on situation in Baghdad.  He </p><p>specifically requested that his comments not/not be provided </p><p>to other than USG offices.  Situation in Baghdad is chaotic </p><p>with no one appearing to be in control.  Ms. Mary Caperton </p><p>Bingham was arrested and taken from the room she shared with </p><p>Mr. Thayer.  At the same time Mr. Matthew McAllester, Mr. </p><p>Moise Saman, Mr. Philip Latasa, and Mr. Johan Spanner, a </p><p>Danish citizen, all disappeared from the hotel.  Thayer </p><p>presumes that they were arrested in the same operation. </p><p>Thayer states that the feeling in the street is 100 percent </p><p>pro-iraq, anti-bush with most of the citizenry in the streets </p><p>being armed with light weapons.  He stated that he had been </p><p>"all over" Baghdad in the past few days and saw no/no armored </p><p>vehicles.  He requested that officers of the DAO contact him </p><p>for discussions.  See reftel for further details on phone </p><p>conversation with ConOff  (See Amman 1876) </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Eight Amcits traveling with the activist group </p><p>Christian Peacemakers Team/Voices in the Wilderness arrived </p><p>in Jordan March 29 after suffering a vehicle rollover on </p><p>Highway 10 in Iraq, caused by either a tire blowout or by </p><p>rubble on the road.  One Amcit is currently hospitalized in </p><p>Amman with broken ribs and a possible spinal injury.  (A </p><p>Consular officer spent several hours in the hospital with the </p><p>injured Amcit early on March 30.)  The Amcits were returning </p><p>from Baghdad in order to catch a previously booked flight out </p><p>of Amman on April 1 when the accident occurred.  All eight </p><p>intend to depart as planned.  If the injured Amcit is unable </p><p>to travel, one of the group will remain with him until he is </p><p>able to do so.  Amman Consular has forwarded names, passport </p><p>numbers and DOBs to taskforce-ca by separate email. </p><p>(reftels: SECSTATE 1627, AMMAN 1875.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Senior Jordanian security officials expressed to us </p><p>regrets that there will likely be ongoing anti-war </p><p>demonstrations around the country during the next several </p><p>days. </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>8. (C) Following up on local press reports of a resumption of </p><p>Jordanian oil tanker traffic to Iraq, the Ambassador raised </p><p>issue with Foreign Minister Muasher on March 29.  The </p><p>Ambassador told Muasher that U.S. military sources believed </p><p>that no tankers had crossed the border, but sought GOJ </p><p>confirmation of that fact.  Muasher said that he did not </p><p>believe that the report was true, but would check.  Later, </p><p>Kuwait News Agency citing a "high level Jordanian official" </p><p>reported that Iraq had suspended all oil shipments to Jordan </p><p>because of the current tension between the two countries. </p><p>(See Amman 1881) </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Information Minister Mohammad Adwan clarified to the </p><p>Ambassador on March 30 that "volunteers" had driven seven oil </p><p>tanker trucks to al-Qaem in Iraq (near H-1) to take delivery </p><p>of some Iraqi oil.  The trucks had returned empty.  The Iraqi </p><p>official in charge of the oil terminal at al-Qaem had told </p><p>the drivers that he had no "license" to give any more crude </p><p>oil to Jordan.  Adwan said that the exercise was "a publicity </p><p>stunt" to disprove Iraqi VP Taha Yassin Ramadan\'s accusatory </p><p>statement last week that Jordan had shut off Iraqi oil </p><p>shipments.  There was no intention by GOJ to resume liftings </p><p>of Iraqi crude as long as hostilities continued. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) UNHCR reported March 30 that 67 TCNs arrived in </p><p>Jordan from Iraq during the night of March 28/29, and 24 </p><p>during the night of March 29/30 (including 10 Westerners </p><p>associated with the CPT group noted above).  UNHCR continues </p><p>to report a reluctant among some of the residents of the </p><p>transit camps to be repatriated.  A media report out of Abu </p><p>Dhabi (ref FBIS GMP 20030330000008) claimed that three trucks </p><p>carrying 70 tons of relief aid crossed into Iraq from Jordan. </p><p> The relief aid, to be distributed in Baghdad, was sent from </p><p>Abu Dhabi,s Red Crescent Society.  Cairo MENA press agency </p><p>reports that Jordan transported 10 truckloads of medicine and </p><p>medical equipment to Iraq.  It also reports that there were </p><p>242 TCNs from 11 countries at the border camp March 29. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Press </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) No further word received on the journalists </p><p>reported missing in Iraq (Amman 1876, Amman 1875 and previous </p><p>sitreps). </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU)  Local papers highlighted the first suicide attack </p><p>against coalition forces and the "stalling" of the march </p><p>toward Baghdad, the growing number of civilian victims of </p><p>coalition attacks, efforts to resume the oil-for-food </p><p>program, and Iraqi denials of any military support from Syria </p><p>or Iran. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
