<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003604 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECIN, ZI, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY BELIEVES ZIMBABWE MUST BE INVITED TO EU-SADC </p><p>FORUM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 136846 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/POL P. THIEDE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL DEMARCHE REQUESTING </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE BE EXCLUDED FROM THE NOVEMBER EU MEETING WITH </p><p>THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC), THE MFA\'S </p><p>OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR SOUTHERN AFRICAN AFFAIRS STATED THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03604  240138Z </p><p>GOI DISAGREED.  WHILE THE LACK OF DEMOCRACY IN ZIMBABWE WAS </p><p>REGRETTABLE, THE MEETING WAS SLATED TO BE BETWEEN THE EU AND </p><p>SADC, NOT INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES, AND THUS THERE WAS NO </p><p>QUESTION OF EXCLUDING ONE OF THE MEMBERS.  FAILING TO INVITE </p><p>ZIMBABWE WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN THE INABILITY TO HOLD THE </p><p>MEETING, AN OUTCOME THAT WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN-EUROPEAN RELATIONS AND REDUCE THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO USE DIALOGUE TO INFLUENCE SOUTHERN AFRICA TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIZE.  EU MEMBERS WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO AGREE ON THIS </p><p>MATTER ON JULY 22.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POLOFF MET WITH MARIO BOLOGNA, THE NEW OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR FOR SOUTHERN AFRICAN AFFAIRS AT THE MFA, ON JULY 17 </p><p>TO PRESENT REFTEL DEMARCHE REQUESTING THAT ZIMBABWE NOT BE </p><p>INVITED TO THE EU-SADC FORUM SLATED FOR NOVEMBER.  BOLOGNA </p><p>SAID THAT THE GOI WAS "AGAINST GRADING ZIMBABWE AGAINST THE </p><p>OTHERS," IMPLYING THAT ZIMBABWE WAS NOT THE ONLY MEMBER OF </p><p>SADC WITH A DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT.  HE WAS "CONVINCED SADC </p><p>REPRESENTS SOUTHERN AFRICA AND CAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIZE THE CONTINENT."  ELABORATING, HE SAID THAT THE </p><p>EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES INCLUDED IN THE DIALOGUE COULD INFLUENCE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) BOLOGNA WAS CONVINCED THAT EXCLUSION OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>WOULD MEAN THAT DIALOGUE WITH SADC WOULD END.  THE GOI DID </p><p>NOT WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN, AS IT WOULD "HAVE CONSEQUENCES </p><p>FOR SOUTHERN AFRICAN-EUROPEAN RELATIONS."  THE AFRICANS WOULD </p><p>FEEL THAT EUROPE WAS AGAINST THEM.  ASKED WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE </p><p>HE ENVISIONED, BOLOGNA WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE A CONCRETE </p><p>ANSWER.  HE NOTED THAT IF AN EU STATE WERE EXCLUDED FROM AN </p><p>EU MEETING WITH ANOTHER REGIONAL ORGANIZATION, THE OTHER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03604  240138Z </p><p>STATES WOULD REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE AS A PROTEST.  THE </p><p>INVITATION WAS TO THE GROUP, NOT TO INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) BOLOGNA CONFIRMED THAT THE ISSUE WAS SLATED TO BE </p><p>DISCUSSED JULY 22.  HOWEVER, HE PREDICTED THAT CONTROVERSY </p><p>WOULD STYMIE THE EU, WHICH WOULD NOT MAKE A DECISION ON THE </p><p>INVITATIONS UNTIL MUCH CLOSER TO NOVEMBER. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03604 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
