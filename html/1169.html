<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 THE HAGUE 001868 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: OREP, ASEC, EFIN, NL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER: VISIT OF CODEL GRAMM TO THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS: THE DUTCH ECONOMY AND EMU </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 104182 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  With a booming economy, ample budget </p><p>surpluses, and a rapidly declining national debt, </p><p>the Netherlands is exceptionally well positioned </p><p>for the coming of the euro.  So far, businessmen </p><p>believe that the benefits of the transition have </p><p>far exceeded the costs, but the Dutch Central Bank </p><p>has urged the business community not to fall </p><p>behind in their preparations for the 2002 </p><p>transition. Substantial U.S. corporate investment </p><p>here, and accelerating Dutch acquisitions in the </p><p>U.S., underscore the continuing importance of the </p><p>U.S. link for the Dutch economy.  U.S. regulatory </p><p>issues, particularly in the financial services </p><p>sector, remain a major interest for many Dutch </p><p>corporations. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE DUTCH ECONOMY: LEADING EUROPE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>2.  After near disaster in the early 1980s, major </p><p>players in the Dutch economy, business and union </p><p>leaders forged a historic consensus linking long- </p><p>term wage restraint to increased investment.  This </p><p>consensus is generally referred to as the "polder </p><p>model" after the artificially-drained fields </p><p>characteristic of the Dutch landscape, and later </p><p>allied to increasing fiscal conservatism.  It has </p><p>yielded impressive results.  The Dutch now enjoy </p><p>an economic growth rate of more than 3 percent, an </p><p>unemployment rate under 4 percent (with 200,000 </p><p>job vacancies), and a second consecutive year of </p><p>budget surplus.  National debt has declined from </p><p>67 percent to 58 percent in the past two years, </p><p>leaving the Dutch well within the conditions for </p><p>joining European economic and monetary union.  All </p><p>in all, the economy is perhaps the soundest in </p><p>Europe.  The labor market, while in some respects </p><p>more rigid than in the U.S., is among the most </p><p>flexible in Europe.  Burgeoning temporary-help </p><p>agencies -- the latest labor-market trend -- offer </p><p>employers additional flexibility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  There are some clouds on the horizon, however. </p><p>For example, the low unemployment rate does not </p><p>take account of persistent long-term unemployment </p><p>among certain groups, especially those over 55, </p><p>the less educated, and immigrants with limited </p><p>language skills.  Labor participation is also </p><p>relatively low among married women.  Moreover, </p><p>years of government effort have failed to reduce </p><p>substantially the unusually large proportion of </p><p>the workforce out on disability payments -- a </p><p>total of 930,000 people out of a labor force of </p><p>about 7 million.  Although the Dutch pension </p><p>system is currently financially sound, an aging </p><p>population, combined with the Dutch penchant for </p><p>retiring early, points to the need to raise </p><p>participation in the labor market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The government has taken a number of measures </p><p>to address these issues.  Among other things, it </p><p>has budgeted more money for day care, and reformed </p><p>the tax system to reduce disincentives to work. </p><p>It is also attempting to combat age discrimination </p><p>among employers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TRADE AND INVESTMENT PATTERNS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>5.  The Netherlands is a quintessentially open, </p><p>service-oriented economy, with trade accounting </p><p>for over 80 percent of its GDP.  The US had a </p><p>trade surplus with the Netherlands in 1999 of USD </p><p>11 billion on close to USD 30 billion of total </p><p>trade, reflecting the importance of the </p><p>Netherlands as a distribution base for US products </p><p>in Europe.  The U.S. is one of the largest </p><p>investors in the Netherlands with a total of over </p><p>USD 80 billion in existing investment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  The Netherlands has long been one of the top </p><p>three investors in the U.S.; while statistical </p><p>lags make it impossible to say for certain, we </p><p>believe that the rapid rate of Dutch investment in </p><p>1999 and 2000 has pushed them into the top slot. </p><p>In the year 2000 alone, widely reported Dutch </p><p>acquisitions in varied sectors including financial </p><p>services and food products have totaled USD 79 </p><p>billion. U.S. acquisitions in the Netherlands have </p><p>attracted less attention and are difficult to </p><p>quantify, but US foreign direct investment in the </p><p>Netherlands continues apace.  Most recently Cisco </p><p>Systems announced a large long-term direct </p><p>investment near Amsterdam.  US investors generally </p><p>cite the quality of the Dutch workforce, efficient </p><p>infrastructure, a favorable and predictable tax </p><p>system and general regulatory structure, and the </p><p>unbeatable location of the Netherlands as a </p><p>transit hub as reasons to locate here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EFFECTS OF EMU ON THE DUTCH ECONOMY </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>7.  As strong supporters of the EU, the Dutch also </p><p>naturally backed EMU.  As a practical matter, the </p><p>Netherlands linked its currency, the guilder, to </p><p>the Deutschmark in 1990, thus effectively giving </p><p>up independent monetary policy as an economic </p><p>tool.  The potential loss of sovereignty involved </p><p>in EMU was therefore less troubling to the Dutch </p><p>than to larger member states.  Due to careful </p><p>fiscal management in the 1990s, the Dutch also had </p><p>little to do to meet the so-called "EMU criteria" </p><p>regarding budget deficits and debt as percentage </p><p>of GDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  However, the move forward in 1997 to the </p><p>second stage of EMU caused some trepidation among </p><p>Dutch policymakers, and aroused little enthusiasm </p><p>among the general public.  Among other things, </p><p>some politicians (including Finance Minister Zalm) </p><p>were uneasy about the inclusion of </p><p>macroeconomically marginal candidates such as </p><p>Italy, and about French attempts to establish some </p><p>measure of political control over the decision of </p><p>the European Central Bank.  French efforts to </p><p>displace Dutchman Wim Duisenberg as first European </p><p>Central Bank (ECB) President did nothing to allay </p><p>these concerns.  In the end, however, the </p><p>political establishment suppressed any qualms and </p><p>held firmly to its commitment to EMU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  In general, the business community expects </p><p>EMU to be a net benefit to the Netherlands.  Early </p><p>studies estimated that the costs of preparing for </p><p>EMU would be more than offset by the benefits, </p><p>ranging from lower exchange costs to competitive </p><p>gains.  The Dutch are confident of their own </p><p>competitiveness and expect EMU to offer them </p><p>increased market opportunities by lowering </p><p>remaining barriers to neighboring markets and </p><p>increasing price transparency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Dutch banks are also looking to EMU with </p><p>optimism.  Two of the three major Dutch banks are </p><p>among the top twenty in Europe; ABN-AMRO is hoping </p><p>to develop a niche market as a clearing bank </p><p>throughout Europe as well as jumping into the </p><p>Internet banking market. In the long term, Central </p><p>Bank studies have also predicted that EMU would </p><p>spur disintermediation in European financial </p><p>markets and a shift from debt to equity financing </p><p>that could help lower capital costs, especially </p><p>for healthy Dutch firms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STAGE THREE: ARE THE DUTCH READY FOR THE EURO? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  The third stage of EMU -- the irrevocable </p><p>fixing of exchange rates and introduction of the </p><p>Euro in financial markets -- took place in January </p><p>1999.  While the Dutch have had no difficulty </p><p>meeting the basic criteria for EMU, and have </p><p>enjoyed relatively low inflation under European </p><p>Central Bank monetary policies, Dutch efforts to </p><p>prepare for actual introduction of the currency </p><p>appear to be lagging behind. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  The latest survey by the Dutch Central Bank </p><p>(DNB) estimates that the Dutch business community </p><p>can expect about USD 3.5 billion in increased </p><p>revenues as a result of the introduction of the </p><p>euro.  The survey also predicts that the euro will </p><p>bring around USD 2.5 billion in new investments </p><p>into the Netherlands.  Despite these attractive </p><p>prospects, many Dutch businesses have been slow to </p><p>begin accepting euro payments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  Fewer than 1 percent of Dutch companies do </p><p>business, or pay taxes, in euros.  80 percent of </p><p>large businesses have a plan for switching over to </p><p>the euro, but many smaller firms have not yet </p><p>focused on the issue. The Central Bank has warned </p><p>that companies without a plan for euro conversion </p><p>risk missing the deadline. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  The banks began the necessary software </p><p>revision for transition to the Euro over a year </p><p>ago, but some of these preparations were retarded </p><p>by the need to troubleshoot for Y2k, which led to </p><p>an acute shortage of technical personnel. </p><p>Moreover, while the banks have begun to issue bank </p><p>statements in guilders and euros, and to offer </p><p>business-to-business transactions in euro, they </p><p>have been reluctant to encourage consumers to open </p><p>euro accounts or pay bills in euro. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  Nevertheless, the Central Bank survey </p><p>concluded that an overall majority of households </p><p>and businesses have faith in the euro. However, </p><p>although most Dutch people and companies feel </p><p>fully informed about the euro, attempts to </p><p>increase euro knowledge in the last year through </p><p>intense media campaigns seem to have failed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  Dutch Trade Minister Gerrit Ybema has argued </p><p>that EMU will benefit both Europe and the US. </p><p>Europe will see increased price stability and </p><p>transparency, and experience fewer deadweight </p><p>losses from currency conversion costs. Ybema </p><p>predicted that US companies will benefit from the </p><p>stabilization of prices and exchange rates as much </p><p>as their European counterparts.  He also suggested </p><p>that EMU will increase the demand for imported </p><p>goods throughout the EU, as well as decrease the </p><p>costs of EU imports headed for the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  We believe that US companies in the </p><p>Netherlands will be among the prime beneficiaries </p><p>of EMU.  As most US companies based here operate </p><p>Europe-wide, elimination of exchange costs will be </p><p>a substantial saving.  The introduction of the </p><p>euro in consumer transactions will probably </p><p>further accelerate development of e-commerce in </p><p>Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE ROLE OF MINISTER ZALM </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>18.  Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm, whom you will </p><p>meet on your visit here, is in his seventh year as </p><p>Minister and has been a key figure in the shaping </p><p>of Dutch fiscal policy and the Dutch approach to </p><p>EMU.  In his first five years as finance minister, </p><p>he was responsible for holding the government on a </p><p>fiscally conservative course. Under his leadership </p><p>the government also rationalized its previously ad </p><p>hoc and chaotic budget process. As finance </p><p>minister, he has also taken a tough line both on </p><p>the budget and on European issues, negotiating a </p><p>substantial reduction in the net Dutch </p><p>contribution to the EU budget. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  In the current coalition government, which </p><p>began in August 1998, Zalm\'s ability to maintain </p><p>fiscal discipline was vastly aided by windfall </p><p>revenue gains that pushed the budget into surplus. </p><p>While government spending will increase, portions </p><p>of the windfall have been used to pay down the </p><p>national debt, with the result that debt service </p><p>payments have declined substantially. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20.  Zalm has also led an effort to overhaul the </p><p>Dutch tax system in order to lower marginal tax </p><p>rates (still  higher than those in the U.S.), </p><p>eliminate loopholes, remove tax disincentives for </p><p>two-income couples, and to eliminate the "poverty </p><p>trap" created by the fact that total benefits and </p><p>subsidies granted to the unemployed often exceed </p><p>net income at the minimum wage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21.  Zalm was among the Dutch politicians calling </p><p>for care in the selection of entrants to EMU. </p><p>Along with the leader of his party, the right-of- </p><p>center VVD, he was accused of "spaghettiphobia" </p><p>for voicing his doubts about the inclusion of </p><p>Italy, Spain and Portugal in the initial eleven </p><p>EMU entrants.  Nevertheless, Zalm has publicly </p><p>proclaimed himself satisfied with the transition </p><p>so far; as he noted, getting eleven European </p><p>countries to vote on a single coin design is in </p><p>itself a signal success.  He has also said, as </p><p>have other observers, that EMU proved itself by </p><p>maintaining European economic momentum during the </p><p>Asia crisis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22.  Bio notes: Although he is the senior VVD </p><p>minister, Zalm is not a career politician. Zalm </p><p>was born in the historic Zuider Zee port of </p><p>Enkhuizen on May 6, 1952, and was educated at the </p><p>Free University of Amsterdam, where he received a </p><p>doctorate in economics and was generally regarded </p><p>as a brilliant student.  He immediately began a </p><p>career in public policy in the budget division of </p><p>the Ministry of Finance, then moved to the </p><p>Ministry of Economics where he became director of </p><p>general economic affairs.  He visited the U.S. on </p><p>a USIS grant in 1986.  In 1988, he joined the </p><p>Central Planning Bureau, the independent </p><p>government planning and forecast agency, and </p><p>became director a year later.  He was appointed </p><p>finance minister in August 1994 at the start of </p><p>the first Kok cabinet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>US BANKS IN THE NETHERLANDS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>23.  US banks are well-established in the </p><p>Netherlands, but concentrate on serving their </p><p>global customers and exploiting niche markets </p><p>rather than retail banking. Most observers believe </p><p>that the large Dutch retail banks will continue to </p><p>dominate their own domestic market even with EMU. </p><p>However, we have heard no complaints about market </p><p>barriers or "doing-business" issues from the U.S. </p><p>banking community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DUTCH BANKS AND INSURERS IN THE UNITED STATES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>24.  Dutch investment in the U.S. financial </p><p>services sectors totalled USD 21 billion in 1998, </p><p>the last year for which we have statistics; taking </p><p>account of the 1999 takeover of Transamerica by </p><p>Dutch firm Aegon, (USD 19 billion) the total is </p><p>probably considerably higher this year. The two </p><p>biggest Dutch banks are big players in U.S. </p><p>financial services sectors: ABN-AMRO has over USD </p><p>100 billion in holdings and 18,000 employees in </p><p>the U.S., including Lasalle Group and Standard </p><p>Federal Bancorporation in the Midwest, while ING </p><p>has over USD 30 billion in US insurance </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25.  Dutch banks, especially ING, welcomed the </p><p>easing of Glass-Steagall restrictions. Current </p><p>concerns include the role of US regulatory </p><p>authorities in the debate over restitution of </p><p>assets confiscated from Holocaust victims.  Aegon, </p><p>which cooperates with the Dutch Jewish Community </p><p>in finding and paying insurance-related claims, </p><p>appears to have resolved the issue with U.S. </p><p>insurance commissioners and the Eagleburger </p><p>Committee.  The banks and the Amsterdam Stock </p><p>Exchange have just reached a settlement worth </p><p>about USD 150 million with the Dutch Jewish </p><p>Council and the World Jewish Congress. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
