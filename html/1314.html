<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 005728 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 10/11/10 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  TSVANGIRAI QUESTIONED AND RELEASED BY POLICE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 5681  B) HARARE 5585 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES EARL IRVING.  REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  05728  111814Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) AT THE REQUEST OF POLICE, MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SPENT TWO HOURS ON OCTOBER 10 AT THE CRIMINAL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION (CID) ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN </p><p>CONNECTION WITH HIS STATEMENT AT A POLITICAL RALLY ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 30.   AS REPORTED REF B, TSVANGIRAI SAID AT THE </p><p>RALLY THAT MUGABE "SHOULD GO PEACEFULLY.  IF NOT, WE WILL </p><p>REMOVE YOU VIOLENTLY."  IN SEVERAL SUBSEQUENT PUBLIC </p><p>APPEARANCES, TSVANGIRAI SAID HE HAD MEANT THAT, IF THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT DOES NOT CHOOSE TO GO PEACEFULLY, THE </p><p>PUBLIC, ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED BY THE DETERIORATION OF THE </p><p>ECONOMY AND BY THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE TO ENSURE THE RULE </p><p>OF LAW, WILL FORCE HIM TO GO. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  IN A PRESS CONFERENCE AFTER HIS QUESTIONING, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI SAID POLICE HAD TREATED HIM WELL.  THEY HAD </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TAKEN HIS FINGERPRINTS AND INFORMED HIM OF FIVE POSSIBLE </p><p>CHARGES THAT MIGHT BE BROUGHT AGAINST HIM.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>EXPECTED THE POLICE WOULD SOON PRESENT ITS EVIDENCE TO THE </p><p>ATTORNEY-GENERAL\'S OFFICE, WHICH WOULD DECIDE WHETHER TO </p><p>PROCEED WITH PROSECUTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) POLOFF SPOKE ON OCTOBER 11 WITH GANDI MUDZINGWA, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S CLOSE AIDE WHO ACCOMPANIED THE MDC PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TO CID HEADQUARTERS.  MUDZINGWA SAID THE FIVE POTENTIAL </p><p>CHARGES MENTIONED BY POLICE RELATED TO CONDUCT INTENDED TO </p><p>BRING THE NAME OF THE PRESIDENT INTO DISREPUTE OR LIKELY TO </p><p>INCITE VIOLENCE OR HOSTILITY AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MUDZINGWA, THE POLICE WERE NOT SURE WHICH </p><p>CHARGES WERE MOST RELEVANT, SO THEY WERE CASTING A WIDE </p><p>NET.  IN THE MEANTIME, TSVANGIRAI HAS NOT BEEN FORMALLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05728  111814Z </p><p>CHARGED AND IS CIRCULATING FREELY.  ASKED WHETHER HE </p><p>THOUGHT THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL WOULD DECIDE TO PROSECUTE, </p><p>MUDZINGWA SAID THE GOZ IS INCREASINGLY DESPERATE, AND HE </p><p>WAS RELUCTANT TO PREDICT WHAT STEPS PEOPLE IN SUCH A STATE </p><p>MIGHT TAKE.  HE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE, THOUGH, THAT MDC </p><p>LAWYERS WOULD EASILY BE ABLE TO REFUTE THE CHARGES IN </p><p>COURT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ALTHOUGH TSVANGIRAI HAS BEEN ROUNDLY CRITICIZED -- </p><p>AND APPROPRIATELY SO -- BY OBSERVERS OF ALL POLITICAL </p><p>STRIPES FOR HIS CARELESS REMARK ON SEPTEMBER 30, HE AND </p><p>OTHER MDC OFFICIALS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY DOES NOT ADVOCATE THE VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE.  WE THINK TSVANGIRAI WAS SURPRISED -- AND CHASTENED </p><p>-- BY THE REACTION TO HIS WORDS AND WILL BE MORE CAREFUL IN </p><p>THE FUTURE ABOUT WHAT HE SAYS IN PUBLIC.  WE CONTINUE TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THE MDC REMAINS A PARTY COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING </p><p>ITS POLITICAL OBJECTIVES USING PEACEFUL MEANS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO </p><p>PROCEED.  THE GOZ MUST BE VERY CAREFUL, AS TSVANGIRAI\'S </p><p>ARREST COULD TRIGGER WIDESPREAD ANGER AND PUBLIC </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH MIGHT PROVE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.   WE </p><p>SUSPECT THAT THE PUBLIC REACTION IN THE FRY AFTER PRESIDENT </p><p>MILOSEVIC\'S RECENT ELECTORAL DEFEAT LIKELY IS A POWERFUL </p><p>IMAGE IN THE MINDS OF PRESIDENT MUGABE AND OTHER SENIOR GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS.  AS MUDZINGWA PUT IT TO US, THE GOZ MADE SO MUCH </p><p>NOISE ABOUT TSVANGIRAI\'S COMMENTS THAT IT HAD AT LEAST TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05728  111814Z </p><p>APPEAR TO BRING HIM TO TASK.  THE QUESTIONING BY POLICE, </p><p>WHICH OVER THE OCTOBER 7-8 WEEKEND HAD BEEN MANEUVERING </p><p>ITSELF INTO A LOSE-LOSE SITUATION THANKS TO ITS SPOKESMAN\'S </p><p>TUB THUMPING ABOUT RUNNING IN TSVANGIRAI, COULD ALLOW THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO SAVE FACE WITHOUT HAVING TO COPE WITH THE </p><p>VOLATILE CONSEQUENCES OF ARRESTING HIM. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
