<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002668 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/RA: BITTRICK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/12/2011 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, MARR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MPRI IPR - WILL THE PROGRAM CONTINUE? </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2653 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: A mostly positive In-Progress-Review of the </p><p>MPRI program was followed by a discussion of MPRI funding </p><p>issues for 2002.  Claiming the GON was unaware that the </p><p>program required an annual commitment of $3.5m, Defense </p><p>Minister Danjuma suggested a new arrangement with a </p><p>significantly smaller burden on the GON.  The unfinished </p><p>discussion on funding will be resumed by Generals Vuono and </p><p>Saint and President Obasanjo, at a meeting likely on October </p><p>24.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>PRE-IPR MEETING </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Prior to the MPRI In-Progress-Review (IPR), OSD/ISA </p><p>African Affairs Director Theresa Whelan met Defense Minister </p><p>Danjuma to discuss the MPRI Program.  DATT, COL Terry Tidler, </p><p>PolMilOff, and MPRI VP General Crosbie Saint (ret), along </p><p>with Danjuma\'s PSO Colonel Pennap and a State Security </p><p>Service Officer were in attendance.  (Ambassador Jeter was </p><p>unable to attend due to a meeting with the Vice President, </p><p>but did attend the IPR.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Whelan emphasized the importance of the MPRI program </p><p>as a cornerstone of the military-to-military relationship, </p><p>which had implications for the entire security assistance </p><p>program, and solicited Danjuma\'s views on moving the program </p><p>forward.  Danjuma agreed on the program\'s importance, stating </p><p>he would like it to continue.  However, he said the GON had </p><p>been unaware the program would cost $3.5m annually.  No money </p><p>had been budgeted for FY02.  Moreover, the value of the </p><p>program would have to be demonstrated to the National </p><p>Assembly.  Although, "totally in favor of the program," </p><p>Danjuma explained he could not force it on his Service </p><p>Chiefs, and would have to "carry them along." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================================= </p><p>IN-PROGRESS-REVIEW: SOME PROGRESS NOTED </p><p>======================================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The MPRI team\'s briefing emphasized significant </p><p>progress since the last IPR in April, largely due to the GON </p><p>providing counterparts for the team.  After the briefing, a </p><p>discussion ensued on funding for 2002.  Chief of Defense </p><p>Staff, Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi, argued that money had not been </p><p>budgeted for 2002.  "Who will pay?", Ogohi questioned. </p><p>Danjuma offered that, since Nigeria faced more financial </p><p>constraints than the United States, Nigeria could fund their </p><p>counterparts for 2002 while the U.S. absorbed the cost of the </p><p>American counterparts (i.e. the larger portion of the tab). </p><p>We are at the mercy of world oil prices and cannot count on a </p><p>supplemental budget, Danjuma explained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Joining the IPR in progress, the Ambassador </p><p>explained that this was Nigeria\'s program, and that funding </p><p>demonstrated commitment.  The 50-50 split had a symbolic </p><p>impact in Washington.  Furthermore, if the U.S. were to bear </p><p>a greater burden, it would affect other security assistance </p><p>programs, such as the C-130 program or the buoy tenders. </p><p>(COMMENT: This statement brought about a look of surprise on </p><p>the Chief of Air Staff\'s face, who exclaimed, "I hope not the </p><p>C-130s!"  When Danjuma mentioned the buoy tenders, Ogohi </p><p>began to shake his head in a defiant "No."  END COMMENT.) </p><p>Finally, there were simply some things that friends and </p><p>supporters should not do.  Nigeria should be seen by its </p><p>people as leading the reform effort, Jeter opined.  That </p><p>meant footing half of the bill. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) After further discussions, it was agreed to try to </p><p>accelerate the program, and then review progress again. </p><p>General Saint noted, however, that until the MOD gave </p><p>instructions on a number of proposals, acceleration could not </p><p>occur.  Danjuma said the MOD would redouble its efforts to be </p><p>responsive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================================== </p><p>COMMENT - NEXT STOP, THE PRESIDENT </p><p>================================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: We believe that Danjuma supports the program, </p><p>as he insists.  However, budget constraints, skepticism in </p><p>the National Assembly for defense-related spending, and, not </p><p>least, Service Chief foot-dragging, constrain him.  Danjuma </p><p>told us during a meeting on October 10 that he would make a </p><p>recommendation to President Obasanjo on renewing the program. </p><p> He also said he planned to attend the meeting between the </p><p>President and Generals Vuono and Saint, which we hope to </p><p>arrange for October 24. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: While Danjuma\'s world oil price </p><p>predictions may be correct, sufficient money can be found for </p><p>the program if the President desires to do so.  We will push </p><p>for this outcome.  However, if the GON is unwilling to pay </p><p>its fair share, then other options, including ending the </p><p>program, will have to be considered.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) This message was cleared by Theresa Whelan. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
