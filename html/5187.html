<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 000466 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/EPD, AND EB/TPP/ABT </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR FOR NOVELLI, DBIRDSEY, JHAFEMEISTER </p><p>USDA FOR FAS FOR ITP/SCANDURRA, GRUEFF, BERTSCH, MACKE, </p><p>MEYER, THORBURN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EAGR, KPAO, TU, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: Turkey Now on Both Sides of GSM Issue </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU)  Summary: After hearing about the benefits of </p><p>  USDA credit guarantee program from the Turkish private </p><p>  sector, the Undersecretariate for Foreign Trade seems to </p><p>  have softened their opposition to the U.S. proposal on </p><p>  export credits. However they remain concerned that the </p><p>  program\'s subsidy component distorts trade and contradicts </p><p>  their current WTO position on domestic and export subsidies. </p><p>  They are aware of the upcoming meetings in Geneva on this </p><p>  issue and are uncertain whether they will have a revised </p><p>  position in such a short time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU)  On January 17, Ag Counselor and Ag Attache met </p><p>  with Deputy Director General for Agreements, Husnu Dilemre </p><p>  at the Undersecretariate of Foreign Trade to discuss the </p><p>  U.S. WTO proposal on export credit programs.  After </p><p>  receiving information from domestic groups (see para 3) </p><p>  Dilemre seems to have a more balanced view of the GSM </p><p>  program and recognizes its importance to the domestic feed </p><p>  and poultry industries.  At the same time, Dilemre and other </p><p>  officials at Foreign Trade reference a 2002 OECD report </p><p>  entitled Agriculture and Trade Liberalization that </p><p>  identifies a subsidy component to the GSM program. Note: </p><p>  Dilemre stated that, according to the report, USDA\'s GSM-102 </p><p>  program is more trade distorting than any export subsidy </p><p>  program.  End note. This has created a dilemma for Foreign </p><p>  Trade, since according to their WTO position, they strongly </p><p>  oppose domestic and export subsidies.  Nonetheless, Dilemre </p><p>  and his staff indicated that will continue discussions on </p><p>  the issue and may seek a more balanced response to WTO </p><p>  discussion on export credits - presumably to one that is </p><p>  more positive than previously reported. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU)  On January 16, Husnu Dilemre met with a diverse </p><p>  group of domestic agriculture associations (including feed </p><p>  and poultry), banks, the State Planning Office and </p><p>  representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and </p><p>  Ministry of Industry to discuss the GSM program.  Comment: </p><p>  Before the meeting, some industry participants indicated to </p><p>  us that they were surprised and pleased that the government </p><p>  would engage them on such short notice.  This is one </p><p>  positive sign that the GOT may be beginning to recognize the </p><p>  need to engage domestic private sector participants as they </p><p>  formulate policy.  End Comment.  During this meeting, </p><p>  domestic groups impressed upon Dilemre the benefits that the </p><p>  GSM program provided them.  Foreign Trade now acknowledges </p><p>  that Turkey is deficient in the production of many </p><p>  agricultural products that are key inputs to several </p><p>  domestic industries.  Dilemre also now recognizes the </p><p>  benefits reaped by users of the GSM program.  Even long-time </p><p>  opponents of the GSM program including the Ministry of </p><p>  Agriculture, and the Chamber  of Agricultural Engineers have </p><p>  softened their criticism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU)  Comment.  FAS/Ankara along with USDA cooperators </p><p>  and banks encouraged local importers, banks as well as  feed </p><p>  and poultry associations to discuss the issue with Turkish </p><p>  officials.  Upon hearing that such a discussion of export </p><p>  credit programs was taking place, most of these private </p><p>  sector representatives wrote letters and contacted officials </p><p>  to express their support for continuation of the program </p><p>  with the current terms. FAS/Ankara will follow-up with </p><p>  Foreign Trade on their revision of their position on GSM and </p><p>  any change to their overall WTO position and proposal. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
