SUMMARY: On July 3, the Ambassador met with Vietnamese </p><p>VFM Nguyen Dinh Bin to deliver Ref A talking points on the </p><p>status of joint research on Agent Orange/Dioxin.  Bin </p><p>emphasized the GVN\'s gratitude for humanitarian efforts by </p><p>non-governmental organizations and U.S. congresspersons who </p><p>have advocated the establishment medical research center for </p><p>Agent Orange "victims" in Hanoi.  Bin appeared uninformed </p><p>and misinformed about the status of U.S. contributions to </p><p>promote the joint research program.    Separately, on July </p><p>15, the Embassy received (via diplomatic pouch) and </p><p>delivered a high-resolution gas chromatography mass </p><p>spectrometer (GCMS) to the Vietnam National Center for </p><p>Natural Sciences and Technology (NCST).  A two-person EPA </p><p>team visited Hanoi during July 24-30 to work with NCST </p><p>scientists on plans/requirements for installation of the </p><p>GCMS, and to map out a plan/schedule for training NCST </p><p>scientists in a bioassay technology, training in use of the </p><p>GCMS, and for characterization of a potential dioxin "hot </p><p>spot" site in Danang Airport.  As of July 2, the Carpenter- </p><p>Tuong health research project had not been presented to </p><p>Committee 33, and the Vietnamese members of the Joint </p><p>Advisory Committee to be established per terms of the March </p><p>2002 MOU had not been appointed.   END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Ambassador\'s Meeting with VFM Bin </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  On July 3, the Ambassador met with Vietnamese First Vice- </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Dinh Bin, also a member </p><p>of Committee 33, to convey the points raised in Ref A </p><p>concerning the status and next steps on joint cooperation on </p><p>Agent Orange/Dioxin issue.  EST Officer accompanied the </p><p>Ambassador.  Mr. Pham Van Que, Deputy Director of the MFA\'s </p><p>Americas Department, also participated. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Prior to launching into a presentation of Ref A talking </p><p>points, the Ambassador informed VFM Bin that many U.S. and </p><p>international scientists did not accept claims made by </p><p>Vietnamese scientists about the affects of AO/dioxin on the </p><p>health of the Vietnamese people.  The Ambassador noted that, </p><p>for example, while Vietnamese scientists attribute numerous </p><p>forms of birth defects on exposure of the parents to </p><p>AO/dioxin, international experts suspect that many are the </p><p>result of other factors, such as deficiencies in the </p><p>mother\'s diet.  Based on this genuine scientific dispute, </p><p>the U.S. Government does not accept the label of "AO Victim" </p><p>placed on virtually every afflicted child.  Bin, without </p><p>acknowledging the scientific debate, responded that the USG </p><p>should deal with this was a humanitarian issue.  Bin several </p><p>times erroneously stated that dioxin was the "cause" of nine </p><p>diseases.  Bin also ignored the point that international </p><p>scientific research has linked dioxin to only one form of </p><p>birth defect.  The Ambassador agreed that assistance to </p><p>persons with health problems was indeed a humanitarian </p><p>issue, which is why the U.S. Government supported health </p><p>assistance programs in Vietnam and worldwide no matter what </p><p>the cause.  (COMMENT:  When Vietnamese officials use the </p><p>term "humanitarian assistance" related to the AO/Dioxin </p><p>issue, they are actually talking about financial </p><p>compensation to those persons whom the Government of Vietnam </p><p>(GVN) has identified - without scientific evidence - as </p><p>"victims of AO."  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  After The Ambassador completed presentation of Ref A </p><p>talking points, VFM Bin responded that he thought "good </p><p>progress" had been made in joint scientific cooperation.  He </p><p>noted that the March 2002 International Conference on </p><p>AO/Dioxin had been the first of its kind, thus Vietnam\'s </p><p>slow pace in implementing the terms of the MOU was </p><p>"expected."  He acknowledged that Vietnam needed to speed up </p><p>the appointment of the members of the Joint Advisory </p><p>Committee (JAC), and noted that formation of the JAC was </p><p>"important and inevitable."  Bin stated that the Vietnamese </p><p>side had sent draft terms of reference (TOR) for the JAC to </p><p>the U.S. side, but had not received a response.  EST Officer </p><p>informed Bin that Office 33 had sent the TOR document via </p><p>international mail to the U.S. National Institute of </p><p>Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) on or about June 30, </p><p>so NIEHS had not yet received the document.  The Ambassador </p><p>pointed out that developing and coordinating TOR should be a </p><p>task for the JAC to accomplish during its first meeting, so </p><p>it was premature to discuss TOR without a committee.  (NOTE: </p><p>EST Officer had received an informal copy of the TOR during </p><p>a visit to Office 33 on July 1.  The document was presented </p><p>without explanation.  On July 7, EST officer received an </p><p>official copy of the document, delivered to the Embassy via </p><p>the Vietnamese postal system.  The envelope was postmarked </p><p>July 1.  Another copy of the document arrived at NIEHS on </p><p>July 21.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  EST Officer gave a brief overview of status of "Project </p><p>2" (soil sampling and "hot spot" site characterization in </p><p>Danang Airport).  Bin, citing talking points provided to him </p><p>by Office 33, pointed out that the U.S. had not yet provided </p><p>Vietnam with the results of tests of Danang soil samples </p><p>shipped to the U.S. in June 2002.  EST Officer responded </p><p>that, contrary to Office 33\'s information, the test results </p><p>had been provided to scientists of the National Center for </p><p>Natural Sciences and Technology in early March 2003. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Bin continued that the GVN highly appreciated the </p><p>support received from NGO\'s and the efforts by three members </p><p>of the U.S. Congress who advocate the establishment of a </p><p>center for research and medical treatment of AO victims. </p><p>Bin expressed hope that the USG would assist by providing </p><p>funds for this center. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Deputy Director Que commented that the GVN did not view </p><p>this as a "legal case," even though Vietnamese authorities </p><p>were fully aware of the legal suit brought by U.S. veterans </p><p>against the U.S. manufacturer of AO.  Que admitted that the </p><p>GVN had considered filing a similar suit, but had abandoned </p><p>that idea several years ago because of its negative </p><p>implications on the overall U.S.-Vietnam bilateral </p><p>relationship.  Que said the GVN had appropriated a large </p><p>portion of its budget to assist people suffering from </p><p>AO/Dioxin exposure in all locations.  Que also reiterated </p><p>Bin\'s appeal to view this as a humanitarian issue. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (COMMENT:  Bin appeared uninformed and/or misinformed </p><p>about several issues related to the status of joint </p><p>cooperation on AO/dioxin.  When EST Officer visited Office </p><p>33 on July 1, Dr. Nguyen Tien Dung had to cut the meeting </p><p>short in order to go the MFA for a meeting to prepare the </p><p>MFA for the Ambassador-VFM meeting.  Based on remarks made </p><p>by Dung and other Vietnamese scientists, the MFA had not </p><p>sent a representative to attend working level meetings on </p><p>the joint research program for a long time.  It appears that </p><p>Committee 33 has not met formally for an even longer time. </p><p>The fact that Bin did not appear to be well-informed about </p><p>the status of the joint program is very telling in terms of </p><p>how senior GVN leadership views the scientific cooperation. </p><p>When senior Vietnamese officials, either from MFA or other </p><p>agencies, appeal to senior U.S. officials for assistance in </p><p>"addressing the lasting effects of AO," they are not talking </p><p>about joint scientific research and capacity building; they </p><p>are talking about financial compensation and medical </p><p>treatment for all those who are classified as "AO victims" </p><p>and for clean-up of all potential dioxin "hot spots" on </p><p>former U.S. military bases and other locations.  Even when </p><p>both sides use the term "humanitarian issue," usage of the </p><p>term differs in both meaning and intent.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Update of Status of Project 2 </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  On July 14, the high-resolution gas chromatography mass </p><p>spectrometer (GCMS) acquired by the U.S. Environmental </p><p>Protection Agency (EPA) from the U.S. Centers for Disease </p><p>Control (CDC) arrived in Hanoi via diplomatic pouch, and the </p><p>Embassy delivered it to the Vietnam National Center for </p><p>Natural Sciences and Technology (NCST) on July 15.  NCST </p><p>intends to place the GCMS on the ground floor of NCST\'s </p><p>Institute of Chemistry.   EPA officers William Coakley and </p><p>Vance Fong visited Hanoi July 24-30 and met with NCST </p><p>scientists from the Institute of Chemistry and Institute of </p><p>Biotechnology who are the principal researchers </p><p>participating in "Project 2" (environmental research on a </p><p>suspected dioxin "hot spot" in Danang Airport).  The primary </p><p>Vietnamese contacts were Dr. Dang Thi Cam Ha, Head, </p><p>Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory; and Dr. Pham Huu Ly, </p><p>Deputy Director, Institute of Chemistry. (NOTE:  The EPA </p><p>team will prepare a full, separate report on their visit. </p><p>END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>10.  The primary purposes of this visit to NCST were to </p><p>unpack and inspect all GCMS components, review in detail the </p><p>requirements and specifications for the installation as well </p><p>as the installation schedule to include assembly and </p><p>performance testing of GCMS and training of NCST personnel </p><p>in its use.  These tasks should all be accomplished by </p><p>November 2003. </p><p> </p><p>11.  During the visit, the EPA officers informed NCST </p><p>scientists that EPA intends to fund the training of two NCST </p><p>scientists in a two-week session at the laboratory of the </p><p>company that produces the CALUX bioassay screening </p><p>technology.  This training covers mammalian, liver cell </p><p>culturing and bioassay procedures, and all extractions, </p><p>cleanup, and analytical software procedures.  Following this </p><p>training in the U.S., the company will provide additional </p><p>training at the NCST lab and provide all necessary supplies </p><p>and chemical reagents. </p><p> </p><p>12.  The two EPA officers and NCST scientists opened all the </p><p>crates containing the GCMS components, inspected the </p><p>separate components for any damage (none detected), and </p><p>conducted an inventory (nothing missing).  They also </p><p>inspected the room that is being renovated to house the GCMS </p><p>and advised the Vietnamese on requirements for electric </p><p>power, cooling water, air conditioning, measures to </p><p>eliminate vibrational interference, electrical outlets, and </p><p>emergency shut-off switch. </p><p> </p><p>13.  On July 26, the EPA team met with Dr. Ha, Dr. Ly, and </p><p>Colonel Nguyen Quang Toai, Department of Science, Technology </p><p>and Environment, Ministry of National Defense (MND), to </p><p>discuss in general terms a tentative plan and techniques for </p><p>hot spot site characterization and a subsequent pilot </p><p>remediation project at the former AO storage and loading </p><p>area at Danang Airport (the suspect dioxin hot spot from </p><p>which soil samples were taken).  The discussions focused on </p><p>possible soil sampling techniques that could most </p><p>efficiently and effectively determine the scope of the hot </p><p>spot and paths/routes of potential migration of dioxin away </p><p>from the hot spot.  Dr. Ha (apparently without prior </p><p>coordination with Ly and/or Toai) suggested that Dr. Toai </p><p>would visit NCST on July 28 or 29 to provide more details </p><p>concerning the actual dimensions of the storage/loading </p><p>area, the surrounding topography, and stream that passes by </p><p>the area.  However, Dr. Toai never visited NCST for follow- </p><p>up discussions. </p><p> </p><p>14.  On July 29, Dr. Dang Vu Minh, General Director, NCST, </p><p>hosted a lunch in honor of the EPA officers to acknowledge </p><p>their efforts in Project 2 and the acquisition and delivery </p><p>of the GCMS.  Dr. Minh was extremely grateful for the GMCS </p><p>and stated that he hoped the installation could be completed </p><p>by the end of the year so that soil sampling using the GCMS </p><p>could be accomplished by January 2004.  He said he intended </p><p>to request additional funds from the Ministry of Science and </p><p>Technology (one source of NCST\'s budget) for upgrading the </p><p>room containing the GCMS.  He also expressed great </p><p>enthusiasm about the potential of receiving the CALUX </p><p>technology.  (COMMENT:  Dr. Minh is a member of the Central </p><p>Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam and a member of </p><p>the National Assembly, so he has some political clout as </p><p>well as scientific expertise.  He is a chemist and former </p><p>Director of NCST\'s Institute of Chemistry.  His support for </p><p>Project 2 is very important.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>15.  Overall, the visit was successful and productive.  The </p><p>Vietnamese are very interested in moving forward with </p><p>certain aspects of Project 2.  The EPA team and NCST </p><p>scientists devised a schedule of events (installation of </p><p>GCMS, training in use of GCMS, training in CALUX technology, </p><p>transfer of CALUX technology) per EPA\'s objectives. </p><p>However, EST Officer and the EPA team detected several </p><p>potential negatives: </p><p> </p><p>     --In discussions on hot spot site characterization and </p><p>remediation, it became apparent that differences in opinion </p><p>on "how hot is hot" and/or "what\'s hot and what\'s not" could </p><p>surface as we attempt to move forward in developing a site </p><p>characterization plan.  When the EPA team explained U.S. </p><p>guidelines and standards for levels of contamination </p><p>permitted for residential vice industrial areas, the </p><p>Vietnamese responded that the Vietnamese leadership would </p><p>not accept such a distinction and would want remediation to </p><p>bring contamination down to a level fit for residential </p><p>purposes.  At this point, EST Officer pointed out that since </p><p>Vietnam, not the U.S., would pay for remediation efforts </p><p>beyond this one pilot project, the Vietnamese leadership </p><p>would probably have to adopt a less rigid policy. </p><p> </p><p>     --In early March 2003, the EPA had sent the NCST </p><p>scientists the test results and analyses for the ten Danang </p><p>soil samples shipped to the U.S. in July 2002.  Prior to </p><p>shipment, Dr. Ha and Dr. Ly had agreed to perform similar </p><p>tests (possibly with low resolution GCMS) on samples of the </p><p>same soil in order to have a comparison of the two test </p><p>results.  When the EPA officers inquired about NCST\'s test </p><p>results (which EPA had never received), Dr. Ha replied that </p><p>she did not have sufficient funds in her budget to pay for </p><p>the tests.   According to Dr. Ha, the cost for a test </p><p>conducted in Vietnam was $600/sample.  The EPA team obtained </p><p>Ha\'s agreement to have tests conducted on 3-5 of the most </p><p>highly contaminated of the ten samples.  This exemplifies a </p><p>persistent detractor to establishing a reliable partnerhip - </p><p>verbal commitments from the Vietnamese side during face-to- </p><p>face meetings are often ignored and the Vietnamese often do </p><p>not respond in a timely manner to queries via e-mail. </p><p> </p><p>     --The role of the MND and its cooperation with NCST and </p><p>EPA is critical to the success of site characterization and </p><p>future pilot remediation project at Danang.  More than one </p><p>year ago, EPA initially requested past sampling results </p><p>conducted by either MND and NCST, but the Vietnamese have </p><p>not delivered.  EPA officers and EST officer sense that </p><p>there potential conflict between NCST and MND could develop </p><p>over control of the joint project.  It is very possible that </p><p>MND is envious of the technical and material support (lab </p><p>equipment, training, GCMS) given to NCST. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>STATUS OF HEALTH RESEARCH AND JOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  In a letter dated June 23 (postmarked July 1), Dr. </p><p>Nguyen Ngoc Sinh, Director, National Environmental Agency </p><p>(NEA), Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, </p><p>responded to a 27 February 2003 letter from Dr. Kenneth </p><p>Olden and Dr. Anne Sassaman of NIEHS urging the Vietnamese </p><p>to appoint members to the Joint Advisory Committee (JAC). </p><p>Sinh\'s letter was addressed to Olden, Sassaman, and Embassy </p><p>EST Officer.   The letter ignores the critical issue of the </p><p>JAC, but takes the offensive to criticize the U.S. for </p><p>delays in Project 2.  Pertinent translated extracts follow. </p><p>BEGIN QUOTE:  Although recently there were organizational </p><p>changes in the Government, such as some ministries were </p><p>split and some new ministries have been established, these </p><p>changes have not affected the activities of the Steering </p><p>Committee 33.  We also note the delay by the United States </p><p>in the implementation of Project No 2.  The Vietnamese side </p><p>has invested in the construction and provided funding for </p><p>the newly built laboratory belonging to the Institute of </p><p>Chemistry, National Center for Natural Sciences and </p><p>Technology, which will be used for Project No 2.  At the </p><p>same time, we have sent 10 soil samples of the Da Nang </p><p>airport area to the Untied States for dioxin analyses as per </p><p>the agreement between Vietnam and the United States under </p><p>Project No 2 framework.   We look forward to the United </p><p>States\' prompt completion of Project No 2.  In particular, </p><p>the United States will follow the plan agreed upon in Hawaii </p><p>on the provision of some testing equipment and instruments, </p><p>and on completion of some analytical methods including the </p><p>Calux analytical method and a high resolution GCMS in order </p><p>to enhance the quality of residual dioxin assessment at </p><p>site, as well as to have scientific basis to determine </p><p>poison cleaning methods for Da Nang area in the future.  END </p><p>QUOTE. </p><p> </p><p>17.  NIEHS did not receive this letter until July 21. </p><p>Although the letter does not mention an attachment, a draft </p><p>TOR for the JAC was attached without explanation.  Also, </p><p>Sinh\'s letter implies erroneously that EPA made a formal </p><p>commitment to provide the GCMS.  EPA only promised to make a </p><p>serious effort to locate a used GCMS.  The Vietnamese were </p><p>made fully aware that funding for this acquisition was not </p><p>readily available within EPA\'s budget.  The fact that EPA </p><p>delivered reflects highly on their positive attitude toward </p><p>achieving success in this project.  The letter also does not </p><p>give EPA credit for providing test results on the 10 soil </p><p>samples or for supplying the majority of the equipment and </p><p>supplies for the laboratory in NCST.  EST Officer and Dr. </p><p>Sassaman are preparing a response to Sinh. </p><p> </p><p>18.  On 1 July, EST Officer met with Dr. Nguyen Tien Dung, </p><p>Director, Office 33.  Dung stated that the Carpenter-Tuong </p><p>health research project had not yet been submitted to </p><p>Committee 33 for review and approval.  Dung said that he had </p><p>sent the grant proposal back to the Ministry of Health for </p><p>further review and comment because he wanted to know how </p><p>this project would relate to a similar health research </p><p>project currently funded by the GVN.  Dung could not state </p><p>with certainty when the proposal would be presented to </p><p>Committee 33 or when the GVN would appoint members of the </p><p>JAC. </p><p> </p><p>19.  As of August 1, the NCST had not yet received approval </p><p>from Committee 33 to hold a joint workshop on remediation </p><p>technologies to be funded and joint organized by NIEHS, </p><p>tentatively scheduled for early November 2003.  NIEHS is </p><p>funding the travel of two NCST scientists from the Institute </p><p>of Biotechnology and one officer from NCST\'s International </p><p>Cooperation Department to visit NIEHS in Research Triangle </p><p>Park and to visit EPA in Washington, DC in late August - </p><p>early September.  The purpose of the meetings is to plan the </p><p>remediation workshop and discuss overall cooperation in </p><p>environmental research. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
