<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001544 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, DS FOR TAYLOR, S/CT FOR BLACK, </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD, CJTF HOA, NSC FOR TOWNSEND AND MCCRAVEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PGOV, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: ROYG OPERATION AGAINST TERRORISTS IN ABYAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 1440 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Summary and Comment:  On June 25, ROYG launched </p><p>an offensive against terrorists suspected in the June 21 </p><p>attack on a ROYG military medical convoy in Abyan (ref).  The </p><p>successful operation resulted in approximately 30 combatants </p><p>killed or captured.  Initial reports indicate a link between </p><p>these terrorists and al-Qaeda, and the strong ROYG response </p><p>appears to have dealt an important and successful blow </p><p>against attempts to re-establish a strong al-Qaeda presence </p><p>in Yemen.  The contribution of U.S.-trained Central Security </p><p>Forces (CSF), the open lines of communication between ROYG </p><p>and the Embassy during this operation and strong </p><p>counterterrorism cooperation between Yemen and the U.S. </p><p>generally emphasize the importance of continuing robust CT </p><p>training assistance.  End Summary and Comment. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  Additional information on both attacks has been </p><p>reported via ORCA and other channels. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>ROYG Operation Against Possible AAIA Remnants in Abyan </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  The attack on a ROYG military medical convoy by </p><p>terrorists, believed to be comprised of remnants of the </p><p>Aden-Abyan Islamic Army (AAIA) and other extremists, in Abyan </p><p>on June 21 left seven injured (ref).  In response, </p><p>approximately 700 ROYG military and security forces gathered </p><p>in the region of the Hatat mountains in Abyan governorate on </p><p>June 24.  Five terrorists surrendered overnight on June 24 </p><p>according to DMI sources.  After negotiations for surrender </p><p>failed and the 1000 June 25 deadline passed without result, </p><p>the ROYG forces began their assault on the remaining </p><p>terrorists (estimated at 80-100 persons).  The combined ROYG </p><p>forces included the Army and U.S.-trained Central Security </p><p>Forces (CSF).  Involvement of possible Political Security </p><p>Organization (PSO) forces could not be confirmed.  The attack </p><p>began with an artillery barrage, followed by helicopter </p><p>attacks and a frontal assault by ground forces. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Consistent but unconfirmed reports from press </p><p>reports and other sources put the number of extremists killed </p><p>or captured at between 20 and 30.  Those captured were being </p><p>interrogated.  Press reports confirmed by CSF also indicate </p><p>that a large amount of explosives and weapons were also </p><p>seized on June 25. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>PSO Chief Gamish -- Terrorist Leader Linked to al-Qaeda? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  At the request of President Saleh via a phone </p><p>call to the Ambassador, the Ambassador and ORCA Chief met </p><p>with Political Security Organization (PSO) Chief Gamish on </p><p>6/26.  Gamish said the reputed leader of the insurgents, Abu </p><p>Bashir Abdul Nabi, was recently in Saudi Arabia and came to </p><p>Yemen in the last three months.  A mujaheed who fought in </p><p>Afghanistan, his mission in Abyan was allegedly to </p><p>re-organize Yemeni al-Qaeda, which has been degraded in the </p><p>last year.  Press reports stated that Abdul Nabi was killed </p><p>in action, and Col. Yahya Saleh of the CSF confirmed that he </p><p>was killed.  Gamish reported that two ROYG forces were killed </p><p>in action and that several captured extremists were being </p><p>interrogated.  DMI told the DATT that two ROYG forces were </p><p>killed and three wounded. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>ROYG Op Successful -- U.S.-trained Forces Key </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)    The Central Security Forces (CSF) </p><p>Counterterrorism Unit is a newly formed entity within the </p><p>Central Security Organization (CSO).  The unit currently </p><p>consists of approximately 150 officers and enlisted.  All </p><p>members of the unit received basic training in rural and </p><p>urban CT tactics.  The training has been and continues to be </p><p>provided by U.S. and U.K. military trainers.  Both groups of </p><p>trainers assess the unit members as being highly motivated. </p><p>The Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) touts this unit as </p><p>the National CT unit of Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  The CSF CT Unit deployed to the Abyan area in </p><p>response to the 6/21 attack on the ROYG military medical </p><p>team.  This unit was the only ground element that was </p><p>deployed from the North of Yemen.  They were heavily involved </p><p>in the fighting, engaging the enemy at ranges as close as 15 </p><p>meters.  They were also tasked to clear and search in excess </p><p>of 20 caves. The unit returned to Sana\'a after the </p><p>hostilities on June 27 only to be redeployed on the morning </p><p>of June 28.  The ongoing effort is aimed at further </p><p>exploiting the caves for intelligence and looking for </p><p>remnants of the terrorist group. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S/NF)  On the evening of June 28, CSF officials invited </p><p>U.S. military trainers to view film footage of combat </p><p>operations conducted by the CSF during the Abyan operation. </p><p>The film confirmed the capture of a large quantity of </p><p>explosives and at least six dead terrorists.  The dead </p><p>terrorists did not appear to be native Yemenis but foreign </p><p>fighters with long beards and military-style ammo vests.  CSF </p><p>indicated that a reduced-length copy of the film will be </p><p>released to the Embassy in the near future. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Comment and Recommendation </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  President Saleh and others have requested continued </p><p>U.S. support for counterterrorism training and the Embassy is </p><p>studying requests for an expansion of economic assistance to </p><p>the Abyan governorate as an area targeted by extremists as an </p><p>operations area.  Somewhat unusually, the ROYG kept the </p><p>Embassy continually informed on developments and invited the </p><p>media to cover the operation.  Additionally, the effective </p><p>performance of the U.S.-trained CSF adds a strong argument </p><p>for sorely-needed further funding to continue and expand CT </p><p>training. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
