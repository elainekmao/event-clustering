<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001774 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT BLACK AND NEA DIBBLE, DOJ FOR DAAG </p><p>BRUCE SWARTZ, NSC FOR TOWNSEND </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, KJUS, PGOV, PTER, MARR, PARM, PREL, GM, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM, TERFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: INITIAL YEMENI REACTION QUIET REGARDING MOAYED </p><p>EXTRADITION DECISION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SANAA 1586 </p><p> </p><p>     B. SANAA 1752 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary and Comment:  Neither Post nor the German </p><p>Embassy in Sana\'a have yet received any direct reaction from </p><p>the ROYG or the public to the German court ruling in favor of </p><p>granting the U.S. request to extradite al-Moayed and his </p><p>companion.  Press reports 24 hours after the decision remain </p><p>non-inflammatory;  however, many opposition papers are not </p><p>yet published.  The ROYG appears to be encouraging a low-key </p><p>immediate reaction.  This is evidenced in part by the </p><p>official statement coming from Berlin and not Sana\'a and the </p><p>emphasis placed on the expected appeals process.  Foreign </p><p>Minister Qirbi\'s demarche (ref B) reflects a serious concern </p><p>by the ROYG about managing the issue.  The ROYG wants to </p><p>avoid harming U.S.-Yemeni counterterrorism cooperation and to </p><p>protect Americans and Germans in Yemen from any violent </p><p>reaction by showing that the government is working hard on </p><p>the issue.  Post will continue to monitor the official and </p><p>unofficial reaction, particularly as it affects security (see </p><p>warden message issued 7/21 in paragraph 8).  End Summary and </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Reaction Towards German and American Embassies </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Post\'s Public Diplomacy section has received no </p><p>press queries as of July 22.  Neither the German Embassy or </p><p>Post has received any new petitions or letters.  ROYG </p><p>officials have not brought up the issue since July 19 </p><p>(reftels). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  German Poloff told Pol/E Deputy July 22 that German </p><p>officials have instituted extra security measures, including </p><p>the use of armored vehicles at all times.  Post will continue </p><p>to monitor the situation closely and implement appropriate </p><p>security adjustments accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>ROYG Statement; Official Media Reaction </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Most official reports featured a press statement </p><p>issued by the Yemeni Embassy in Berlin.  As reported in the </p><p>press, the statement reiterated "ROYG\'s firm stand" on </p><p>pursuing resolution to the case and confirmed that "the two </p><p>mentioned Yemeni citizens were lured from Yemen to Germany in </p><p>violation of international laws and against Yemeni </p><p>sovereignty."  It added that the Yemeni authorities would </p><p>follow up the case and make "all the efforts" to succeed in </p><p>the appeal.  It ended with a line about having confidence in </p><p>the continuation of Yemen-German relations. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Official daily al-Thawra issued the press statement </p><p>on its front page July 22.  Yemen television news on July 21 </p><p>did not lead with the story, instead reporting it in a </p><p>straightforward manner towards the end of the newscast and </p><p>emphasizing the expected appeals process. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Other Media Reaction;  Islah Party </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Islah party affiliated Sahwa-net July 22 published </p><p>the Yemeni Embassy\'s statement from Berlin and reported that </p><p>Hamoud al-Darihi, member of the Islah Supreme Authority and </p><p>Chairman of the Follow-up Committee on the al-Moayed case, </p><p>expressed "his astonishment" about the German court decision. </p><p> Al-Darihi said his committee has been in touch with the </p><p>Yemeni Ambassador to Germany and al-Moayed\'s lawyer and </p><p>confirmed that they will appeal to the German higher court. </p><p>Al-Darihi also disclosed that a Yemeni parliament and Shura </p><p>Council delegation will be leaving for Germany next Wednesday </p><p>to "continue convincing the German government to return </p><p>al-Moayed and his companion to Yemen." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Independent al-Ayyam also did a straightforward </p><p>report on the decision, the travel of the parliamentary and </p><p>Shura Council delegation and al-Darihi\'s remarks. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Warden Message </p><p>-------------- </p><p>8.  (U)  Text of Warden Message: </p><p>The Embassy of the United States wants to inform American </p><p>citizens in Yemen that the German authorities have ruled in </p><p>favor of the U.S. request to extradite Yemeni Sheik Mohamed </p><p>Ali Hassan Al-Moyyad.  Sheik Al-Moyyad was provisionally </p><p>arrested by the German authorities on U.S. criminal charges </p><p>of providing material support to foreign terrorist </p><p>organizations.  Sheik Al-Moyyad has the right to appeal this </p><p>decision and it is fully expected that he will do so. </p><p> </p><p>In light of this judgment and the expected appeals process, </p><p>American citizens in Yemen are reminded to pay particular </p><p>attention to their personal security at all times.  Americans </p><p>should make it a point to keep a low profile, vary routes and </p><p>times of travel, avoid large crowds and demonstrations and </p><p>report any suspicious activity to the Embassy\'s Regional </p><p>Security Office at 303-156/7/8/9. </p><p> </p><p>End Text of Warden Message. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
