KATHMANDU 712 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 677 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 723 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>Valley Strike:  Quiet Streets </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  A general strike, or bandh, called for Kathmandu </p><p>Valley by the Nepali Congress (Democratic) Party student </p><p>union was generally widely observed on April 23.  A few </p><p>private and commercial vehicles were seen plying the streets, </p><p>while most shops remained shuttered.  There were a few </p><p>scattered reports of minor vandalism to private and </p><p>government vehicles, but the capital remained largely </p><p>peaceful throughout the day.  The international schools, </p><p>including the school attended by most Mission children, </p><p>closed for the day (Ref A).  The Embassy has received no </p><p>reports of threats or injuries to American citizens as a </p><p>result of the strike.  The Peace Corps Country Director </p><p>reported that all volunteers were coping well with the </p><p>strike.  The Embassy will hold an Emergency Action Committee </p><p>in the coming days to address two additional national strikes </p><p>called by student unions for April 28 and 29 (Ref B). </p><p> </p><p>Political Parties Use Students as Surrogates </p><p>============================================ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Emboffs, including the Ambassador and DCM, have </p><p>complained to senior political leaders that students in their </p><p>affiliated unions have committed acts of violence and </p><p>vandalism during demonstrations over the past few weeks. </p><p>Most of our interlocutors, while trying to disassociate </p><p>themselves from the violence, have attempted to portray the </p><p>protests as spontaneous expressions of public dissatisfaction </p><p>that they claim they have not orchestrated and cannot </p><p>control.  Spokesmen for the two largest parties, the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML) and </p><p>the Nepali Congress (Koirala), have tried to draw parallels </p><p>between the current student unrest and the popular </p><p>demonstrations of the 1990 People\'s Movement, which resulted </p><p>in the restoration of democracy.  When asked to make an </p><p>unequivocal public statement denouncing violent protests, </p><p>they have demurred, trying to justify their public silence on </p><p>this issue by assuring us that they are telling their </p><p>students in private to avoid violence.  (Note:  The notable </p><p>exception has been former Prime Minister and Nepali Congress </p><p>(Democratic) president Sher Bahadur Deuba, who told the </p><p>Ambassador on April 21 that his party was passing a </p><p>resolution against violence and that his students\' strike </p><p>would thus eschew violence.  As promised, today\'s strike was </p><p>noticeably more peaceful.  End note.)  Other leaders, </p><p>however, seem decidedly unwilling to counsel their student </p><p>wings against violence.  On the contrary, Nepali Congress </p><p>(Koirala) President G.P. Koirala lashed out against the </p><p>government in the press for a second time on April 23, </p><p>charging it was the source of the current political turmoil. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Ever since King Gyanendra appointed the interim </p><p>government in October, the political parties, outraged by </p><p>what they perceive as his efforts to marginalize them, have </p><p>been promising to "launch a joint struggle" against his </p><p>action.  Public indignation against the King\'s move, however, </p><p>has proven tepid thus far, and the parties are clearly </p><p>delighted to use their ever-volatile student wings as </p><p>surrogates.  Unlike the 1990 demonstrations, which were aimed </p><p>at achieving well-defined democratic reforms, the current </p><p>protests are diffuse and ill-focused, with no cohesive set of </p><p>demands and no recognizable public support.  The number of </p><p>different student groups on the street--and the relative </p><p>anonymity that gives them--can increase the potential for </p><p>acts of violence.  Moreover, even though the </p><p>Maoist-affiliated wing has officially disassociated itself </p><p>from the strikes that have occurred since the April 16 </p><p>decision to postpone student elections, the possiblilty </p><p>remains that its members might infiltrate these </p><p>demonstrations, thereby increasing the chance for the </p><p>protests to turn violent.  We will continue to urge the </p><p>democratic political leaders to adopt a more responsible </p><p>stand on this important matter. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
