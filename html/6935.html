<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000611 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KWWW, PREL, OPRC, OIIP, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: STATE-OWNED MEDIA\'S PORTRAYAL OF THE WAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A. SECSTATE 81604 </p><p> </p><p>     B. B. SANAA 607 </p><p>     C. C. SANAA 606 </p><p>     D. D. SANAA 593-MEDIA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Alan Misenheimer for reasons E.O. 12958, 1.5 (b), (c </p><p>) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Although the tone of the Yemeni State owned </p><p>and operated media was subdued in the first few days of the </p><p>war, it has become more strident with developments in the </p><p>theater of war as well as in the wake of increasing protests </p><p>in yemen and the Arab world. Nevertheless, state-controlled </p><p>media have not emphasized visuals of civilian casualties. </p><p>Ambassador has urged Foreign Minister to promote balance in </p><p>coverage. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Coverage in the Yemeni State owned and controlled </p><p>media, consisting of several dailies and weeklies and the </p><p>only television station in the country (Yemen-TV) was very </p><p>controlled and cautious in the first few days of the </p><p>beginning of the Iraq campaign.  However, following the </p><p>bloody demonstrations near the American Embassy on Friday 21, </p><p>2003, and Iraqi VP Ramadan\'s thinly-veiled criticism of </p><p>Yemen\'s position, there has been a noticeable shift in the </p><p>volume and tone of coverage (see ref. D).  Friday\'s violent </p><p>demonstration was reported factually only late that night on </p><p>Yemen TV and the official Al-Thawra daily did not even </p><p>display photographs on its first page the next day. On the </p><p>other hand, both media as well as other state newspapers </p><p>carried long and prominent reports on a subsequent peaceful </p><p>demonstration on Thursday, March 27th, at Sanaa\'s central </p><p>square.  Yemen TV had a 20-minute coverage of the event, </p><p>compared to its cursory coverage of the violent demonstration </p><p>a week prior. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) All government dailies and weeklies, in coverage </p><p>articles, editorials and op-ed pieces, have been using such </p><p>strident terms as "Aggression against Iraq", "Unjustified </p><p>aggression", "Agression against Iraq is agression against </p><p>humanity", "A war without bases in international law", "We </p><p>deplore the fall of innocent victims", "The new Vietnam War" </p><p>and the like. Coverage of the war and various opinion </p><p>articles cover almost half the number of pages of some of the </p><p>dailies.  However, it is important to note that both State </p><p>television and the printed media are not using the </p><p>sensational pictures of civilian casualties nor the </p><p>photographs of slain coalition soldiers.  TV text is often </p><p>more strident than the pictures that run with it.  Very </p><p>often, we get footage of coalition forces in action with a </p><p>text that is totally irrelevant to what is being shown. </p><p>Yemen radio, which is also State owned and controlled, has </p><p>been following the lead of television and the official </p><p>papers. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In a meeting with Foreign Minister Qirbi Saturday, </p><p>March 29, the Ambassador raised the issue of media coverage. </p><p>Ambassador told the FonMin the U.S. has no interest in </p><p>targeting civilians since our strategy is to distance </p><p>Saddam\'s regime from the Iraqi population.  In fact, said the </p><p>Ambassador, coalition forces have been taking great pains to </p><p>avoid civilian casualties.   By contrast, the Ambassador </p><p>noted, the Iraqis seem to be firing on civilians who are </p><p>trying to flee conflict areas.  The Ambassador also noted </p><p>that coalition forces are now making a huge effort to provide </p><p>humanitarian relief to the population of Iraqi regions now </p><p>under their control. He asked Dr. Qirbi to promote a balanced </p><p>approach by ROYG, both in statements and in official coverage </p><p>of events in the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) For his part, Foreign Minister Qirbi said that he </p><p>feels that U.S. SecDef Rumsfeld\'s finger pointing at Syria </p><p>and Iran were counterproductive.  He said such issues should </p><p>be addressed in diplomatic channels, not publicly.  Moreover, </p><p>said Qirbi, these public remarks give ammunition to those who </p><p>predict a U.S. invasion of Syria and/or Iran, after Iraq is </p><p>done. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: The increase in the stridency of tone and </p><p>content in the Yemeni official media could be a direct </p><p>consequence of the rising anger in the Yemeni populace that </p><p>was expressed in the bloody confrontation of the March 21 </p><p>demonstration and that is continuing to be expressed </p><p>peacefully in subsequent demonstrations.  Demonstrations in </p><p>other Arab capitals and cities also seem to be fueling this </p><p>stridency as Yemenis attempt "to keep up with the Joneses." </p><p>Of more significance however, are the graphic reports from </p><p>Al-Jazeera and other broadcasts. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
