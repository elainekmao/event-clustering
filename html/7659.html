<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000795 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, DRL </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: STAYAWAY, DAY TWO:  NO BUSINESS, AS USUAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 779 </p><p> </p><p>     B. HARARE 550 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Laboff KRBel for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> 1. (SBU)  Summary.  The second day of the ZCTU-called </p><p>stayaway continued with widespread industrial shutdown, many </p><p>banks closed, and more shops and grocery stores closed than </p><p>Wednesday.  The GOZ seems determined to find a scapegoat that </p><p>minimizes public support, claiming that the ZCTU has paid </p><p>transport operators to abandon their regular routes. </p><p>Conflicting reports abound, but labor sources indicate that </p><p>they will not renew a call for an indefinite stayaway, but </p><p>will instead support the MDC when it renews calls in May for </p><p>a nationwide mass action.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Participation Remains High </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  A quick tour through industrial Harare indicated </p><p>that businesses continued with a 70-90% shutdown rate (ref </p><p>a).  Banks remained closed, for the most part, and many more </p><p>shops and grocery stores were locked.  One press report </p><p>stated that infamous "labor leader" (and defeated Zanu-PF </p><p>candidate for Parliament) Joseph Chinotimba personally </p><p>intervened with a clothing store in downtown Harare, first </p><p>forcing the owner to open his shop, and later arresting the </p><p>owner for not keeping his business open.  The GOZ-controlled </p><p>media has also claimed that the ZCTU paid transport operators </p><p>up to Zim $50,000 each to buy their cooperation and </p><p>compensate them for lost business in an effort to prevent </p><p>workers from reaching their jobs. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Rumors of Continuation Not Confirmed </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  One local businessman reports that the ZCTU has </p><p>called for an additional four days of stayaway next week, </p><p>from April 29 through May 2 -- and encompassing the May 1st </p><p>Labor Day holiday.  However, we have received no </p><p>corroboration from labor contacts.  By contrast, the </p><p>Solidarity Center rep reports that the stayaway will end as </p><p>of COB on Friday, and states that workers will report as </p><p>usual from Saturday onwards.  This contact also stated that </p><p>the ZCTU intended this stayaway as an opening salvo, and will </p><p>now concentrate its efforts on coordinating with the MDC in </p><p>future mass actions scheduled for early May.  Additionally, </p><p>MDC sources have previously indicated that they would not be </p><p>ready for a renewed call for mass action before May 5, </p><p>possibly as late as May 13.  Although they may now intend to </p><p>capitalize on the momentum generated by the ZCTU\'s action, we </p><p>have had no independent corroboration of such a plan. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>GOZ Attempts to Spin the Situation </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  The GOZ has been desperately attempting to pre-empt </p><p>further public mass action through concession, coercion, and </p><p>confusion.  The GOZ-controlled press published stories of </p><p>new, reduced transport fees (with a maximum price of Zim $300 </p><p>one-way) on the second day of the stayaway.  The GOZ also </p><p>coupled this story with public threats of revocation of </p><p>licenses should transport operators fail to ply their </p><p>assigned routes.  Today, on the third and final day of the </p><p>stayaway, the headlines trumpet newly announced minimum </p><p>wages, reportedly negotiated between government and </p><p>businesses under the Tripartite Negotiating Forum (TNF), </p><p>despite the fact that labor -- the third party -- has </p><p>publicly disavowed further participation.  In its statement </p><p>calling for the stayaway, the ZCTU publicly blasted the GOZ </p><p>for raising the fuel price unilaterally outside of the TNF </p><p>process (ref a) and announced that the previously negotiated </p><p>minimum wages had "been overtaken by events on the ground" </p><p>and were no longer adequate.  Now, the GOZ is hailing the </p><p>"negotiated" minimum wage as a triumph for workers -- at </p><p>levels agreed (but not signed into law) as early as March </p><p>(ref b), well before fuel was raised by 300%. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The ZCTU seems to be drawing strength from the </p><p>widespread support of this call for mass action.  We have </p><p>received some reports of labor leaders being arrested in </p><p>Bulawayo, and some national ZCTU leaders are reportedly in </p><p>hiding ahead of rumored Harare arrests.  The potential for </p><p>massive retaliation remains a real threat, with Minister of </p><p>Information Jonathan Moyo calling for criminal and civil </p><p>penalties against labor union officials under the draconian </p><p>Public Order and Security Act, which has given the GOZ great </p><p>leeway for arrest and detention of opposition leaders.  Given </p><p>the widespread shutdown of businesses, it will be difficult </p><p>for the GOZ to spin this stayaway as a failure.  The combined </p><p>efforts of both labor and the MDC in future calls to action </p><p>will increase political and economic pressure on the GOZ. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
