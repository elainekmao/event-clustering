DAM, </p><p>AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL AND HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS COORDINATOR </p><p>(PHAC) RUSS BALLANTYNE, AND THE BANGBAT UNMO LEADER </p><p>BRIEFED ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS.  DAM SAID THE BOSNIAN </p><p>FIFTH CORPS HAD ADVANCED ALMOST 200 KILOMETERS IN SIX </p><p>DAYS, AND NOW HAD TO COVER A CONFRONTATION LINE OF 103 KM </p><p>AND PATROL THE TERRITORY WITH ONLY 20,000 TROOPS.  BOSNIAN </p><p>TROOPS WERE ALSO STATIONED ON THE CROATIAN-BOSNIAN BORDER. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03939  01 OF 03  101030Z </p><p>THE VII CORPS HAD SECONDED ONE BRIGADE TO V CORPS </p><p>COMMANDER DUDAKOVIC, GIVING HIM 10 BRIGADES.  DAM BELIEVED </p><p>DUDAKOVIC WOULD TAKE MRKONIC GRAD AND TRY TO TURN THE </p><p>EXPERT LIGHT INFANTRY CORPS ON PRIJEDOR UNLESS  POLITICAL </p><p>PRESSURE FROM SARAJEVO AND NEW YORK STOPPED HIM.  ONE </p><p>ARKAN BRIGADE HAD ARRIVED IN PRIJEDOR 10 DAYS EARLIER, DAM </p><p>SAID.  THE RECENT V CORPS SUCCESSES, DESPITE INCREDIBLE </p><p>ODDS (THE SERB HAD OVER 60,000 TROOPS IN THE BANJA LUKA </p><p>AREA), AND THE LACK OF A COUNTER-OFFENSIVE BY THE BSA HAD </p><p>CONVINCED DAM THAT THE SERBS HAD PURPOSELY EVACUATED THE </p><p>AREA.  THE SERBS EXPECTED TO GIVE UP MUCH OF THIS </p><p>TERRITORY IN POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS ANYWAY, HE COMMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>REFUGEES, REFUGEES </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE UN ESTIMATED THAT 11,000 DISPLACED PERSONS </p><p>(DPS) WOULD REACH THE CANTON FROM OTHER PARTS OF BOSNIA, </p><p>MOSTLY BANJA LUKA.  THE GOBH CLAIMED THE NORTHERN BIHAC </p><p>CANTON COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE THEM, AND WANTED TO PLACE </p><p>THEM IN THE NEWLY LIBERATED AREAS.  400-500 MUSLIM </p><p>REFUGEES FROM THE BANJA LUKA REGION HAD ALREADY RESETTLED </p><p>IN THE NORTH.  UNHCR AND CANTON AUTHORITIES DID NOT WANT </p><p>TO SETTLE THESE REFUGEES IN THE EMPTY HOMES OF THE ABDIC </p><p>REFUGEES AND WERE SEARCHING FOR HOUSING.  THE GOBH HAD </p><p>PUBLICLY WELCOMED BACK MOST OF THE ABDIC REFUGEES, BUT </p><p>REFUSED TO DECLARE ANOTHER AMNESTY.  BALLANTYNE SAID THE </p><p>SARAJEVO AUTHORITIES HAD DECLARED THE 1994 AMNESTY STILL </p><p>VALID.  THE BOSNIANS, CROATS, AND TURKS WERE DISCUSSING </p><p>ESTABLISHING A TRILATERAL POLICE FORCE IN THE AREA TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03939  01 OF 03  101030Z </p><p>GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THOSE WHO RETURNED.  BALLANTYNE </p><p>ESTIMATED THAT 10-15 PERCENT OF THESE REFUGEES WOULD NOT </p><p>BE ALLOWED BACK INTO BOSNIA BECAUSE THEY WERE ACCUSED OF </p><p>COMMITTING WAR CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  BALLANTYNE ESTIMATED THE CURRENT POPULATION OF </p><p>KLJUC AT 1100.  620 MUSLIMS HAD SURVIVED THREE AND A HALF </p><p>YEARS OF SERBIAN OCCUPATION AND HAD REMAINED IN THE TOWN. </p><p>AFTER UNPROFOR HAD PROTESTED THE RESETTLEMENT OF 207 DPS </p><p>IN KLJUC, AT THE CONFRONTATION LINE, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>STOPPED THE PLANNED RESETTLEMENT OF ANOTHER 3000.  CROATIA </p><p>REFUSED TO TAKE THESE PEOPLE, AND HAD RECENTLY STOPPED </p><p>ALLOWING THE DPS TRANSIT THROUGH CROATIA AT DVOR, TO THE </p><p>BIHAC CANTON.  THE GOC REFUGEE REPATRIATION ORDER, UN </p><p>OFFICIALS SAID, MIGHT SEND MANY MUSLIMS BACK TO THIS </p><p>TERRITORY BEFORE THE AREA IS SECURE. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>ON THE ROAD </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.
