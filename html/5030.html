<p>S E C R E T OTTAWA 000081 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PARM, KNNP, PREL, IN, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA\'S NONPROLIFERATION DIALOGUE WITH INDIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 578 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S)  Canada shares our concern over Indian export controls </p><p>on WMD/missile programs, and welcomes our dialogue with India </p><p>on entities trying to acquire controlled goods (reftel). </p><p>Marina Laker, Foreign Affairs Deputy Director for </p><p>Non-Proliferation, Arms Control and Disarmament, told us that </p><p>Canada regularly raises this issue with the GoI, along with </p><p>the more general problem of India\'s nuclear weapons program. </p><p>She said that Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific David </p><p>Kilgour is currently in India and will raise these issues. </p><p>Laker said that because of its non-proliferation concerns, </p><p>Canadian restrictions on defense exports to India are the </p><p>most stringent of any Western country, and asked about U.S. </p><p>loosening of its own restrictions on military sales to India. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Foreign Minister Graham issued a statement on January </p><p>8 urging India not to carry out planned ballistic missile </p><p>tests, and to abide by UNSCR 1172 by ceasing its development </p><p>of nuclear weapons and delivery systems.  Graham also called </p><p>on India to adhere to the International Code of Conduct </p><p>(ICOC) against ballistic missile proliferation.  Laker said </p><p>that Canada has no illusions, however, about how New Delhi </p><p>will proceed, calling "Indian nonproliferation" an oxymoron. </p><p>She said that Canada wants to continue to address the issue </p><p>of Indian proliferation at the Nuclear Suppliers Group, as </p><p>well as at the Missile Technology Control Regime points of </p><p>contact meeting in February. </p><p>GALLAGHER </p><p></p></div>
