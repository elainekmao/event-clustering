REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) A SENIOR EU TEAM HAD A VERY ROCKY MEETING WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE ON NOVEMBER 23.  THE PARTICIPANTS ENGAGED IN A NORMAL </p><p>DIPLOMATIC DISCUSSION OF THE DRC INTERNAL DIALOGUE AND THE </p><p>INVOLVEMENT OF FOREIGN TROOPS IN DRC, BUT MUGABE BECAME </p><p>INCREASINGLY IRRITATED AS THE CONVERSATION SHIFTED TO THE RECENT </p><p>UN REPORT ON EXPLOITATION OF RESOURCES.  MUGABE DISMISSED THE </p><p>REPORT AS "ABSOLUTE NONSENSE" INSPIRED BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. </p><p>EVERYTHING ZIMBABWE HAD DONE IN THE DRC, HE INSISTED, HAD BEEN </p><p>DONE IN COOPERATION WITH THE KINSHASA GOVERNMENT.  WHEN THE EU </p><p>DELEGATION PRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVERS PARTICIPATING IN ZIMBABWE\'S ELECTORAL PROCESS, MUGABE </p><p>LASHED OUT.  HE SAID THE EU SHOULD LEAVE ZIMBABWE ALONE, AS THE </p><p>GOZ COULD RUN ITS OWN ELECTION.  IT DID NOT NEED THE EU\'S HELP. </p><p>VISIBLY ANGRY, HE WALKED OUT OF THE MEETING WITHOUT A WORD, </p><p>LEAVING HIS EU INTERLOCUTORS "FLABBERGASTED."  THE EU OFFICIALS </p><p>DID NOT EVEN TRY TO PUT A POSITIVE PUBLIC SPIN ON THE ENCOUNTER </p><p>AND LATER TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT THEY HAD NOT HAD A MEETING OF THE </p><p>MINDS WITH MUGABE AND THAT THE EU WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE OUTCOME </p><p>OF THE ELECTION UNLESS MINIMUM CONDITIONS WERE RESPECTED.  FOR ITS </p><p>PART, THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PRESS APPLAUDED MUGABE IN BANNER, </p><p>ABOVE-THE-FOLD HEADLINES FOR TELLING OFF THE EU.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03539  01 OF 03  261353Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) BELGIAN DCM ALEXIS DE CROMBRUGGHE GAVE POLITICAL SECTION </p><p>CHIEF A READOUT OF A DIFFICULT NOVEMBER 23 MEETING IN HARARE </p><p>BETWEEN PRESIDENT MUGABE AND A HIGH-LEVEL EU DELEGATION COMPRISING </p><p>BELGIAN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER LOUIS MICHEL, </p><p>EU ENVOY JAVIER SOLANA, COMMISSIONER CHRIS PATTEN, EU SPECIAL </p><p>ENVOY FOR THE GREAT LAKES ALDO AIELLO AND SPAIN\'S DIRECTOR-GENERAL </p><p>FOR AFRICA.  CROMBRUGGHE SAID THE DELEGATION MET WITH CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY REPRESENTATIVES AND WITH OPPOSITION LEADER MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI, BUT THE MEETING WITH MUGABE WAS THE CENTERPIECE OF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THEIR ONE-DAY VISIT AND THE ONE WHICH GARNERED THE MOST MEDIA </p><p>ATTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) CROMBRUGGHE SAID ONLY THE BELGIAN AMBASSADOR JOINED THE </p><p>FIVE-PERSON EU DELEGATION IN THE MUGABE MEETING.  THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PRESIDENT WAS JOINED BY FOREIGN MINISTER MUDENGE, MFA PERMANENT </p><p>SECRETARY WILLARD CHIWEWE, DEFENSE MINISTER SEKERAMAYI, AND CHIEF </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OF DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE GENERAL CHEDONDO. </p><p> </p><p>DRC </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ACCORDING TO CROMBRUGGHE, MICHEL BEGAN BY SAYING THE MAIN </p><p>PURPOSE OF THE DELEGATION\'S VISIT WAS TO DISCUSS DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>THE DRC, BUT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID RAISING THE DOMESTIC </p><p>SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE AS WELL.  HIS INTRODUCTORY REMARKS </p><p>APPARENTLY PROVOKED NO NEGATIVE REACTION FROM THE ZIMBABWEAN SIDE, </p><p>AND PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS DIPLOMATIC AND FORTHCOMING AT THE OUTSET. </p><p>MUGABE STAYED TRUE TO FORM BY PROVIDING HIS DETAILED HISTORICAL </p><p>PERSPECTIVE ON ZIMBABWE\'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE DRC, EMPHASIZING THAT </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN INVITED IN. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03539  01 OF 03  261353Z </p><p> </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN FORCES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MUGABE STRESSED THE GOZ\'S COMMITMENT TO THE LUSAKA </p><p>PROCESS, BUT WARNED THAT A WITHDRAWAL BY ZIMBABWEAN FORCES NOW </p><p>WOULD CREATE SECURITY PROBLEMS.  THUS ZIMBABWE WOULD WAIT TO </p><p>WITHDRAW UNTIL THE UNITED NATIONS DEPLOYED FULLY.  WHEN SOLANA </p><p>PRESSED HARD FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN TROOPS, MUGABE SAID </p><p>TROOPS CAN BE WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME BUT REITERATED THAT THIS STEP </p><p>SHOULD HINGE UPON THE CREATION OF A SUFFICIENTLY SECURE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT.  MICHEL SAID HE WAS NOT SURE THAT MONUC WOULD BE ABLE </p><p>TO DEPLOY THE LARGE NUMBERS DESIRED BY MUGABE BUT THAT HE HOPED </p><p>DDRR COULD PROCEED IN THE MEANTIME.  MUGABE MAINTAINED THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN TROOPS HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO WITHDRAW </p><p>15 KM FROM THE FRONT LINE, IN CONTRAST TO RWANDA, WHICH HAD MERELY </p><p>REPLACED ITS SOLDIERS WITH FIGHTERS FROM RCD-GOMA.  MUDENGE INSISTED </p><p>THAT ZIMBABWE WOULD NOT MAINTAIN ITS MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE DRC </p><p>ANY LONGER THAN NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE. </p><p> </p><p>INTERNAL DIALOGUE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1358 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03539  02 OF 03  261353Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------4317A0  261353Z /48 </p><p>O 261252Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0369 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 003539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03539  02 OF 03  261353Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 11/26/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT MUGABE WALKS OUT ON EU TEAM </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MICHEL REGRETTED THE FAILURE OF THE INITIAL INTERNAL </p><p>DIALOGUE MEETING IN ADDIS ABABA, BUT REPORTED THAT PRESIDENT </p><p>KABILA AND FACILITATOR MASIRE HAD AGREED WITH HIM IN KINSHASA ON </p><p>THE NEED FOR ANOTHER MEETING SOON, BUT ONE THAT WOULD BE PRECEDED </p><p>BY SMALLER, PREPARATORY DISCUSSIONS.  AIELLO SAID THE EU </p><p>RECOGNIZED THAT PRESIDENT KABILA WOULD BE PRESIDENT DURING A </p><p>TRANSITION PERIOD LEADING TO ELECTIONS, BUT NOTED THAT, IN SOME </p><p>COUNTRIES, A TRANSITION PERIOD FOLLOWED AN ELECTION.  PATTEN ADDED </p><p>THAT THERE WAS AGREEMENT WITHIN THE EU THAT KABILA SHOULD LEAD THE </p><p>TRANSITIONAL PERIOD, AND MICHEL SAID HE THOUGHT THE REBELS WOULD </p><p>ACCEPT THIS.  MUGABE ASSERTED THAT PRESIDENT KABILA RISKS BEING </p><p>TOPPLED IF THE TRANSITION PERIOD COMES FIRST, BUT SAID THAT </p><p>DECISION IS UP TO THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE.  HE HOPED THAT MASIRE </p><p>WOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS POINT. </p><p> </p><p>UN REPORT ON EXPLOITATION OF RESOURCES </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) WHEN MICHEL SOLICITED MUGABE\'S COMMENT ON THE RECENT UN </p><p>REPORT ON THE EXPLOITATION OF RESOURCES IN THE DRC, THE </p><p>CONVERSATION BEGAN TO GO DOWNHILL QUICKLY, CROMBRUGGHE REPORTED. </p><p>MUGABE CALLED THE REPORT "ABSOLUTE NONSENSE," SAYING EVERYTHING </p><p>ZIMBABWE HAD DONE IN THE DRC HAD BEEN DONE IN CONSULTATION WITH </p><p>THE KINSHASA GOVERNMENT.  THE DRC GOVERNMENT, HE INSISTED, HAD </p><p>NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT ZIMBABWE\'S INVOLVEMENT.  HE DISMISSED THE </p><p>REPORT COMPLETELY, SAYING IT HAD BEEN INSTIGATED BY THE BRITISH. </p><p>THE EU TEAM, MUGABE SAID, WAS PUTTING ITS CREDIBILITY ON THE LINE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03539  02 OF 03  261353Z </p><p>BY EVEN MENTIONING IT.  MUDENGE ADDED THAT THE REPORT HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>ENDORSED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL.  SOLANA EMPHASIZED THAT THE </p><p>REPORT EXPRESSED THE POSITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  NO, </p><p>IT DOESN\'T, MUGABE REPLIED, IT EXPRESSES ONLY THE POSITION OF THE </p><p>BRITISH GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MICHEL THEN RAISED THE ISSUE OF INTERNATIONAL ELECTION </p><p>OBSERVERS, ELICITING A "VERY AGGRESSIVE" REACTION FROM MUGABE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO CROMBRUGGHE.  MUGABE\'S RESPONSE WAS ALONG THE LINES </p><p>OF "WE DON\'T NEED YOUR HELP, WE DON\'T WANT YOU TO ORGANIZE OUR </p><p>ELECTIONS.  LEAVE US ALONE."  HE THEN ADDED, SOMEWHAT CRYPTICALLY, </p><p>THAT MARGARET THATCHER WAS "A LADY YOU CAN TALK TO."  MUDENGE </p><p>RAISED A POINT OF ORDER, NOTING THAT THE BELGIANS, IN THE NOTE </p><p>REQUESTING THE MEETING, HAD INDICATED THAT THE DELEGATION ONLY </p><p>INTENDED TO DISCUSS THE DRC.  AT THAT POINT, A VISIBLY IRRITATED </p><p>MUGABE STOOD UP AND LEFT THE ROOM, WITH NARY A WORD OR HANDSHAKE. </p><p>THE EU DELEGATION WAS APPARENTLY "FLABBERGASTED," AND MICHEL </p><p>COMMENTED PRIVATELY TO THE BELGIAN AMBASSADOR THAT MUGABE\'S </p><p>REACTION HAD BEEN OVER THE TOP AND IRRATIONAL.  MUDENGE APPEARED </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY HIS BOSS\'S UNEXPECTED WITHDRAWAL </p><p>FROM THE ROOM, AND SAID QUICKLY TO THE DELEGATION THAT THE GOZ </p><p>WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE ARTICLE 96 DIALOGUE.  LATER IN THE DAY, A </p><p>SENIOR MFA OFFICIAL PHONED THE BELGIAN EMBASSY TO CONVEY </p><p>OFFICIALLY THE GOZ\'S AGREEMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ARTICLE 96 </p><p>PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>---------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03539  02 OF 03  261353Z </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) CROMBRUGGHE SAID HE HAD ARRANGED A PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE </p><p>VIP DEPARTURE LOUNGE LATER IN THE DAY, BUT MINISTRY OF INFORMATION </p><p>OFFICIALS INITIALLY PROHIBITED THE PARTICIPATION OF JOURNALISTS </p><p>FROM THE INDEPENDENT PRESS.  ONLY AFTER HE INSISTED THAT THEY BE </p><p>ADMITTED AND PERSONALLY ESCORTED THEM FROM A HOLDING ROOM AT THE </p><p>OTHER END OF THE AIRPORT WERE THEY ABLE TO INTERACT WITH MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE DELEGATION.  THE EU OFFICIALS WERE UNUSUALLY CANDID WITH </p><p>THE REPORTERS, SAYING THAT THE TALKS WITH MUGABE HAD BEEN "VERY </p><p>FRANK AND VERY DIFFICULT."  SOLANA TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT "WE PUT </p><p>IT CLEARLY TO HIM THAT UNLESS THEY COMPLY WITH THE MINIMUM </p><p>CONDITIONS FOR THE RUNNING OF THE ELECTIONS, IT WILL BE VERY </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR THE ELECTION RESULTS TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THE EU." </p><p>MICHEL SAID THE TEAM WANTED TO HAVE A FRANK DISCUSSION WITH MUGABE </p><p>BUT THAT "TODAY, IT WAS NOT EASY TO DO."  PATTEN ADDED THAT "ALL I </p><p>CAN SAY IS WE DID NOT HAVE A MEETING OF THE MINDS WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE" AND THAT THE EU WOULD "INSIST ON THE BASIC MINIMUM </p><p>STANDARDS FOR CLEAN ELECTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA PRAISED </p><p>MUGABE FOR STANDING UP TO HIS INTERLOCUTORS, INDICATED BY THE </p><p>ABOVE-THE-FOLD HEADLINE IN NOVEMBER 24 EDITION OF "THE HERALD" -- </p><p>"PRESIDENT TELLS EU OFF."   THE ARTICLE REPORTED THAT MUGABE HAD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1362 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03539  03 OF 03  261354Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------4317B1  261354Z /48 </p><p>O 261252Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0370 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 003539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03539  03 OF 03  261354Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 11/26/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT MUGABE WALKS OUT ON EU TEAM </p><p> </p><p>TOLD THE DELEGATION TO "KEEP OUT OF ZIMBABWE\'S AFFAIRS" AND THAT </p><p>HE HAD DISMISSED AS "ABSOLUTELY NONSENSICAL" THE UN SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL\'S RECENT REPORT ON ZIMBABWE\'S EXPLOITATION OF DRC </p><p>RESOURCES.  AT A PUBLIC EVENT FOLLOWING THE FATEFUL MEETING, </p><p>MUGABE TOLD THE ASSEMBLED CROWD THAT THE EU SHOULD KEEP OUT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE, AS "SOME OF THEM WERE OUR FORMER COLONIZERS.  WE HAVE </p><p>ENOUGH EXPERIENCE IN HOLDING ELECTIONS AND WE DO NOT NEED THEIR </p><p>ASSISTANCE." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S ANGRY REACTION APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>DISPROPORTIONATE, AND SUGGESTS THAT HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN </p><p>ENGAGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ON HOW TO EXTRICATE ZIMBABWE </p><p>FROM ITS CURRENT CRISIS, IF SUCH ENGAGEMENT IMPLIES ANY ACCEPTANCE </p><p>OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS COUNTRY\'S PROBLEMS. THE NOVEMBER 23 </p><p>EXCHANGE WILL LIKELY WORSEN AN ALREADY STRAINED EU-ZIMBABWE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, BUT MUGABE SEEMS INCREASINGLY WILLING TO WAG HIS </p><p>FINGER -- WHICHEVER FINGER -- AT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p>MUDENGE, WHO IS OFTEN ONE OF THE GOZ\'S MOST STRIDENT VOICES, WAS </p><p>APPARENTLY NONPLUSSED BY HIS BOSS\'S BEHAVIOR, AND THE GOZ\'S QUICK </p><p>ACCEPTANCE OF THE ARTICLE 96 DIALOGUE SO SOON AFTER THE </p><p>UNFORTUNATE MEETING WAS A CLEAR ATTEMPT AT DAMAGE CONTROL.  WE ARE </p><p>COMING TO THE CONCLUSION, HOWEVER, THAT AS LONG AS MUGABE REMAINS </p><p>THE GOZ\'S ONLY REAL DECISION-MAKER, WE ARE UNLIKELY TO SEE MUCH </p><p>PROGRESS ON THE ISSUES OF CONCERN TO US, THE EU, THE COMMONWEALTH, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03539  03 OF 03  261354Z </p><p>AND ZIMBABWE\'S NEIGHBORS. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
