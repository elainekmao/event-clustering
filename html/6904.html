But while Nigeria possesses </p><p>the resources to meet a significant portion of U.S. </p><p>demand, poor processing capacity severely limits its </p><p>ability export to the United States. USAID assistance </p><p>is helping Nigeria to realize the export potential of </p><p>gum arabic through improving harvesting and post- </p><p>harvest handling techniques used by the industry in </p><p>northern Nigeria, establishing market linkages with </p><p>U.S. buyers, and providing laboratory equipment to </p><p>certify gum arabic quality. In a ceremony attended by </p><p>U.S. Ambassador Howard F. Jeter on February 26, 2003, </p><p>laboratory equipment funded through the USAID project </p><p>was handed over to the Jigawa State Gum Arabic </p><p>Company.  The laboratory facility will enable gum </p><p>arabic to be tested and certified to meet </p><p>international quality standards, helping to ensure </p><p>that the gum arabic produced in Nigeria is suitable </p><p>for U.S. manufactures and guaranteing that Nigeria\'s </p><p>gum arabic farmers and producers earn premium prices </p><p>for their product. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p>Gum arabic is a key ingredient in a wide variety of </p><p>U.S. manufactured products and industries, including </p><p>soft drinks, baked goods and candies, cosmetics, </p><p>pharmaceuticals, and printing (e.g., newspapers). </p><p>Given its significance to U.S. manufacturers, the </p><p>United States is the largest consumer of grade one </p><p>(top grade) gum arabic, importing more than 60 percent </p><p>of the world?s raw and processed supply. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gum arabic is a naturally occurring product that is </p><p>exuded from the stems and branches of the acacia tree. </p><p>More than 70 percent of the world?s supply is produced </p><p>by Sudan on an annual basis.  However, U.S. sanctions </p><p>against Sudan, initiated in 1997, mean that the U.S. </p><p>manufactures have limited direct access to Sudanese </p><p>gum arabic, with imports of raw gum arabic from Sudan </p><p>dropping from more than 7,000 MT in 1990 to just over </p><p>1,000 MT in 2002.  With demand for gum arabic in the </p><p>United States increasing (overall imports of raw gum </p><p>arabic have doubled since 2000 compared to the early </p><p>1990s), U.S. manufactures have had to increasingly </p><p>rely on intermediary countries for their supply.  For </p><p>example, in 2002, France was the second largest </p><p>exporter of raw gum arabic to the U.S., supplying more </p><p>than one-third of the total imported that year.  All </p><p>of this was imported by France, and subsequently </p><p>exported to the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Given the importance of gum arabic to U.S. </p><p>manufacturers, USAID has teamed with the U.S. private </p><p>sector to diversify the supply of gum arabic, </p><p>expanding the opportunity for direct imports and </p><p>minimizing the impact of the rapidly changing </p><p>political landscape in eastern Africa.  The initial </p><p>project in this effort is a collaborative gum arabic </p><p>sector development program in Nigeria, one of the </p><p>friendly countries in the gum arabic belt of West </p><p>Africa and, along with Sudan and Chad, one of the top </p><p>three producers worldwide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Nigerian gum arabic sector is substantially under- </p><p>developed with respect to commercial production and </p><p>marketing standards.  Nigerian gum is traditionally </p><p>harvested from wild forests on public or private </p><p>lands, and could benefit from an inherent price </p><p>advantage over Sudan and Chad due to the county\'s port </p><p>access.  But while Nigeria possesses the natural </p><p>resources to supply at least one-third (5,000 MT) of </p><p>current U.S. demand for raw gum arabic, poor harvest </p><p>and post-harvest production capacity limit Nigeria\'s </p><p>ability to export to the United States, which </p><p>accounted for less than one percent (100 MT) of total </p><p>U.S. imports in 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition to benefiting U.S. manufacturers, </p><p>enhancing Nigeria\'s capacity to produce gum arabic </p><p>will develop an economic opportunity for rural farmers </p><p>in the Muslim North.  With low input costs (consisting </p><p>largely of a rudimentary tapping tool, labor and </p><p>transportation costs) and a value of between $1,000 </p><p>and $1,500 per MT, gum arabic is the most profitable </p><p>crop in the region of northern Nigeria. Gum arabic </p><p>producers earn between $0.27 and $0.35 per kg.   In </p><p>comparison, other non-irrigated products that are </p><p>grown in similar areas, including cowpeas, groundnuts, </p><p>sesame, sorghum and millet, currently earn farmers </p><p>between $0.19 and $0.27 per kg (with equal or higher </p><p>input costs).  Given that competing crops earn less </p><p>revenue and have comparable to moderately higher input </p><p>costs, gum arabic harvesting would seem to be a </p><p>rational choice of crop for farmers to concentrate on, </p><p>perhaps in conjunction with one of the other food </p><p>crops. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Environmentally, by increasing the economic </p><p>opportunities associated with old-growth acacia </p><p>forests naturally occurring in Nigeria, improving gum </p><p>arabic post-harvest production will encourage </p><p>Nigeria\'s farmers to preserve existing forests which </p><p>would otherwise be cut-down in order to plant other </p><p>crops.  Similarly, increased production capacity will </p><p>enhance the potential for including acacia trees in </p><p>integrated and rotated cropping schemes, helping to </p><p>reduce soil erosion, fix nitrogen, and recycle other </p><p>nutrients lost to leeching from the top-soil. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>USAID GUM ARABIC PROJECT </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Beginning in early 2002, USAID initiated a project to </p><p>improve the production and marketing of Nigerian gum </p><p>arabic through strengthening gum arabic associations </p><p>and enhancing the capacity of local private sector </p><p>participants involved in gum arabic trading.  The </p><p>training was conducted in five states in northern </p><p>Nigeria (Bauchi, Borno, Jigawa, Kano and Yobe).  The </p><p>project has had strong collaboration from the U.S. </p><p>private sector, which assisted with training in </p><p>product standards, preparing training materials, and </p><p>providing technical advice during training workshops. </p><p>The project also included support to purchase and </p><p>install laboratory equipment to certify the quality of </p><p>the gum produced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The USAID program successfully trained approximately </p><p>200 farmers and traders from the targeted states on </p><p>the management of gum arabic plantations to improve </p><p>output and marketing. These trained participants </p><p>reported that they have extended information on best </p><p>practices to a further 3,000 people. These trainings </p><p>are already showing results. The most telling evidence </p><p>of successful adoption of practices leading to </p><p>increased productive capacity are the increased size </p><p>of gum nodules, a reduction in the instances of </p><p>adulteration, and the introduction of traceability </p><p>techniques.  The use of improved tapping techniques by </p><p>farmers allows gum to exude into larger nodules, which </p><p>in turn is realized in increased volumes of grade one </p><p>gum, which corresponds to a higher quality product as </p><p>larger gum nodules are cleaner, easier to grade, sort </p><p>and bag.  This increase in grade one volume has </p><p>occurred despite problems of locusts and the wetter </p><p>than usual rainy season, which have lowered overall </p><p>gum production in the northern region.  Traders have </p><p>reported that the gum they are buying is purer than it </p><p>has been in recent years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The USAID program stimulated increased commercial </p><p>interest in the gum producing states.  For instance, </p><p>in Jigawa state, about 330 hectares of new plantations </p><p>have been established, while 250,000 seedlings were </p><p>raised as part of the state\'s long term strategy. This </p><p>is in addition to the approximately 900 hectares of </p><p>gum arabic in the state, some 500 hectares of which </p><p>are being harvesting for export. In Yobe state, the </p><p>Government during the year produced and distributed 10 </p><p>million seedlings with support from the National </p><p>Association of Gum Arabic Producers, Processors and </p><p>Exporters of Nigeria (NAGAPPEN). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The program also supported the management of NAGAPPEN. </p><p>This aspect of the program implementation has shown </p><p>the most visible result.  NAGAPPEN has emerged as an </p><p>association that is capable of effectively </p><p>representing the gum arabic sector in each gum </p><p>producing state and organizing economic activity </p><p>through the monitoring and enforcement of improved </p><p>practices.  Dues paying members, with no outside </p><p>guidance, have initiated these chapters independently. </p><p>The Association, which is less than two years old, now </p><p>has over 2,000 dues-paying members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>LABORATORY EQUIPMENT CEREMONY, FEBRUARY 26, 2003 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>On February 26, 2003, USAID-funded laboratory </p><p>equipment was formally presented to the Jigawa Gum </p><p>Arabic Processing Company, Ltd. (GAPCO), at a ceremony </p><p>attended by U.S. Ambassador Howard Jeter, and His </p><p>Excellency, the Governor of Jigawa State, Saminu </p><p>Turaki.  The laboratory is located at Maigatari Export </p><p>Processing Zone (EPZ), in Jigawa State, and will serve </p><p>the major processing zone of northern Nigeria, as well </p><p>as neighboring countries, including Chad.  This </p><p>quality control is essential in order to meet the </p><p>quality standards demanded by buyers from the United </p><p>States and Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Ambassador Howard Jeter cut the tape marking the </p><p>official opening of the facility, and noted the strong </p><p>need to enhance the Jigawa Gum Arabic Processing </p><p>Company\'s production capacity, and to encourage </p><p>farmers in the state to expand their capacity to </p><p>provide a high quality product.  Apart from being a </p><p>great source of employment, he said, the laboratory </p><p>would "give importers greater confidence in the </p><p>products they are buying". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Jeter reiterated that the Nigerian Gum </p><p>Arabic Program is a win-win situation in which the </p><p>U.S. industry would gain by diversifying its sources </p><p>of gum arabic, thus minimizing risk, and the Nigerian </p><p>farmers, traders and exporters would see a significant </p><p>improvement in their incomes and employment from the </p><p>development of the gum arabic sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>REMARKS BY JIGAWA GOVERNOR </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>His Excellency, the Governor of Jigawa State, Saminu </p><p>Turaki, expressed satisfaction with the state\'s </p><p>relationship with the United States and noted that the </p><p>laboratory presentation had positioned Jigawa State to </p><p>pursue further negotiations with TIC gums, a U.S. </p><p>based firm that has negotiated a memorandum of </p><p>understanding for the purchase of high quality gum. </p><p>Governor Turaki said the gum arabic project was meant </p><p>to enhance the economic status of the region, </p><p>including Niger Republic, where some 10 million </p><p>seedlings were recently distributed to farmers.  The </p><p>regional outlook of the project, he said, would enable </p><p>the producers to compete effectively in the </p><p>international market.  Turaki said women who formed </p><p>the larger percentage of the poor in the region would </p><p>be mobilized to take part in the initiative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The participants to the ceremony toured the GAPCO </p><p>warehouse and observed several tons of gum being </p><p>sorted and graded in sacks with the GAPCO labels. </p><p>This is the first commercial shipment of gum being </p><p>exported from Jigawa state.  The gum acacia trees had </p><p>been planted some 25 years ago for reforestation </p><p>purposes, and its potential for gum arabic production </p><p>had not been realized prior to this project.  The </p><p>first year harvest and export is expected to be a </p><p>modest 168 tons, but will undoubtedly grow due to the </p><p>strong leadership of Jigawa state, private sector </p><p>partnership with U.S. companies, and the enhanced </p><p>capacity of Nigerian farmers to properly harvest the </p><p>gum. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p>While production of premium-quality grade one gum </p><p>arabic in Nigeria is still low, the potential for </p><p>significantly expanding the production of gum arabic </p><p>suitable for export to the United States articularly </p><p>in terms of grade and quality is high. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The USAID project has sought to educate farmers and </p><p>traders on the comparative advantages of producing gum </p><p>arabic.  By introducing best practices in cultivation, </p><p>harvesting and marketing, trainees have learned to </p><p>meet the specifications of U.S. importers, and have </p><p>extended these practices to others in their locations. </p><p>The sector is poised to be globally competitive </p><p>through the establishment of NAGAPPEN chapters in each </p><p>of the targeted states, which will be crucial to </p><p>future dissemination of best practices, industry </p><p>monitoring and self enforcement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USAID\'s program to improve the production of gum </p><p>arabic in Nigeria is contributing to the strategic </p><p>U.S. goal of diversifying sources of imports, while at </p><p>the same time providing much needed income and foreign </p><p>exchange earnings to farmers in northern Nigeria. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
