During a recent visit to </p><p>Washington, MFA U/S Ambassador Ziyal presented the U.S. with </p><p>a list of possible Turkish contributions to the rebuilding </p><p>of Iraq, according to Cumhuriyet.  Ankara signaled that </p><p>Turkey\'s airbases and ports would be opened to the U.S., </p><p>that Turkey would send troops for Iraqi peacekeeping, that </p><p>U.S. troops in Iraq could spend vacations in Turkey, and </p><p>that Turkey\'s higher education council (YOK) could help in </p><p>the restructuring of Iraqi universities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Northern Iraq disarms: KDP and PUK officials have agreed </p><p>with U.S. General Colin Schite that civilians living in </p><p>Northern Iraq should be disarmed within two weeks, papers </p><p>report.  Only peshmerges of the two Kurdish groups will be </p><p>allowed to carry weapons. </p><p>EC adopts `anti-Turkish\' bills: Dailies write about two anti- </p><p>Turkish reports adopted on Tuesday by the Council of Europe </p><p>Parliamentary Assembly.  The first report claims that the </p><p>Greeks and Maronites are living under pressure in Northern </p><p>Cyprus, and that their properties have been seized.  The </p><p>other report demands that migrants sent from Turkey to the </p><p>north of the island following the Turkish occupation in 1974 </p><p>should return home.  The movement of settlers has caused </p><p>significant changes in the demographic structure of the </p><p>island, where settlers from Turkey now outnumber native </p><p>Turkish Cypriots. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Denktas rebuffs criticism by Holbrooke: Turkish Cypriot </p><p>leader Denktas responded to Richard Hobrooke, who had blamed </p><p>him for blocking a solution on the island merely out of </p><p>personal ambition.  Denktas said: `I have turned 79, and </p><p>cannot be obsessed by greed at this age.\'  Denktas accused </p><p>Holbrooke of involvement in financial dealings with the </p><p>Greeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AKP to hire more Muslim preachers: Ruling AKP lawmakers </p><p>voted on Tuesday for a massive increase in the number of </p><p>Muslim clerics and preachers employed by the state, papers </p><p>report.  The AKP backed the increase in the budget for the </p><p>Department of Religious Affairs (DIB), the state body that </p><p>employs around 88,000 staff and preachers to run mosques </p><p>across Turkey and in other countries. They voted to employ </p><p>an additional 15,000 clerics and preachers, instead of a </p><p>proposed 1,600.  Opposition party CHP officials said a total </p><p>of 34,000 public sector appointments were planned by the </p><p>government in 2003, and that the enormous additional </p><p>staffing would make DIB the fifth largest public </p><p>institution. The IMF had earlier opposed a similar attempt </p><p>by AKP.  The decision still needs to be approved in the main </p><p>assembly, where the AKP has a strong majority, and signed by </p><p>the president before it takes effect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: US-Pakistan; Iran </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US and Pakistan" </p><p>Fikret Ertan wrote in the Islamist-intellectual Zaman </p><p>(6/25): "The visit of Pakistan\'s leader Musharraf to Camp </p><p>David is significantly important for the future of Asia as </p><p>well as ties between Washington and Islamabad.  . Issues on </p><p>the agenda range from the Kashmir problem to Afghanistan, </p><p>and from changes in the Pakistani army to Pakistan\'s </p><p>official recognition of Israel. . The issues discussed and </p><p>results achieved at the Camp David meeting will not only </p><p>have an enormous effect on the US-Pakistan relations, but </p><p>will also play a determining role in the future of </p><p>Afghanistan and other countries in the region.  The US- </p><p>Pakistani summit could also have an impact on the political </p><p>status of General Musharraf." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Changing regime in Iran" </p><p>Ergin Yildizoglu argued in social democrat-intellectual </p><p>Cumhuriyet (6/25): "The effort to change the regime in Iran </p><p>is part of an American policy to alter the regional </p><p>equilibrium.  Following the occupation of Iraq, regional </p><p>balances have shifted.  Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries </p><p>have lost their strategic importance.  By stationing itself </p><p>in northern Iraq, the US now has the advantage to be able to </p><p>intervene in both Iran and Turkey. . If the Mullahs\' regime </p><p>in Iran is eventually replaced with a pro-American regime, </p><p>the US will have the privilege of controlling an energy </p><p>corridor from Iraq to China.  In this case, Turkey will lose </p><p>its strategic importance and its future will be tied to its </p><p>relationship with Washington. . It is in Turkey\'s interest </p><p>as well that Iran changes its regime, yet becomes a </p><p>democratic and independent country with which Turkey can </p><p>establish a certain degree of alliance." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
