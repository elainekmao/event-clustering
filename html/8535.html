<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000999 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JFRASER </p><p>CAIRO FOR JMAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR ENGAGES POLITICAL ELITES IN </p><p>KANO </p><p> </p><p> Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5(b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: On May 19-20, Ambassador Jeter traveled to </p><p>the North,s largest city, Kano, for meetings with prominent </p><p>community leaders and key political players.  Four themes </p><p>dominated the discussions: 1) electoral irregularities; 2) </p><p>potential for violence after the elections; 3) the </p><p>independence of election tribunals; and 4) perceptions that </p><p>the USG is pro-Obasanjo.  Most interlocutors disparaged the </p><p>results of the April 19 Presidential elections and advised </p><p>that Obasanjo,s failure to respond to Northern complaints </p><p>could lead to violent reactions after the inauguration. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>POSSIBLE VIOLENCE IF GRIEVANCES ARE NOT ADDRESSED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ado Bayero, Emir of Kano and among the most </p><p>influential northern traditional rulers, warned about the </p><p>possibility of violence if the Government failed to address </p><p>complaints of electoral malpractices.  The Emir said he had </p><p>met Obasanjo several times to discuss the possibility of </p><p>violence, each time stressing the need to reconcile with </p><p>opposition groups.  &We want peace and stability in Nigeria. </p><p> This explains why we urged all aggrieved candidates to </p><p>utilize the election tribunals.8  On a parallel track, the </p><p>President should attempt to reach a political reconciliation </p><p>with the opposition, Bayero stressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Junaidu Muhammed, a prominent Kano politician, </p><p>signaled a possible &northern eruption.8  He cautioned that </p><p>the current silence in the North was &not an endorsement of </p><p>the Presidential elections.8  Northerners felt Buhari won </p><p>the elections.  Muhammed cited 1966 as an example, noting </p><p>that it took the North five months to react to the </p><p>assassinations of Northern-based leaders resulting in </p><p>Nigeria,s first military coup.  When the reaction finally </p><p>came, it was massive.  The slowness of the reaction does not </p><p>augur weakness.  &While the North reacts slowly, it also </p><p>tends to over-react8, he said.  Muhammed stated that calming </p><p>the tension depended on how well Obasanjo reached out to his </p><p>opposition.  He predicted, however, that Obasanjo,s ego and </p><p>vindictiveness would prevent him from making politic </p><p>concessions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Rabi,u Musa Kwankwaso, outgoing Governor of Kano </p><p>State and the only incumbent PDP governor to lose, believed </p><p>that Kano would remain calm since the ANPP won the election. </p><p>So far, Kwankwaso is right. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>PARTIES WERE GUILTY OF ELECTORAL MALPRACTICES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Muhammed said all political parties committed fraud in </p><p>last month,s elections.  He claimed that a free election in </p><p>Kebbi might not have returned the ANPP governor.  He posited, </p><p>however, that the ruling PDP was the most prolific culprit, </p><p>accusing it of using security agents, pliant electoral </p><p>officials and party thugs to guarantee victory at all levels. </p><p> While voter vigilance in urban centers minimized fraud, </p><p>rural areas were fertile ground for electoral manipulation. </p><p>Muhammed told the Ambassador that INEC officers and security </p><p>officials approached parties to offer &their services and </p><p>cooperation8 with the hope of coaxing the parties into an </p><p>escalating bidding war for their services.  In Katsina, when </p><p>Governor Yar,adua heard that officials were making overtures </p><p>to the ANPP, he offered to beat the price, Muhammed asserted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Auwalu Yadudu, Harvard-trained law professor, election </p><p>monitor and former legal adviser to former Heads of State </p><p>Abacha and Abubakar, gave a graphic account of various forms </p><p>of electoral malpractices, including ballot box stuffing by </p><p>government officials, voter intimidation, changing of voter </p><p>tallies, underage and multiple voting, use of money, and lack </p><p>of fairness by the INEC officials.  Yadudu opined that </p><p>INEC,s shoddy preparations provided an open door for </p><p>electoral fraud.  He said that most polling stations used two </p><p>voters, lists -- the hand-written register and the INEC </p><p>computer-generated list.  He said some electoral officials </p><p>colluded with politicians to divert election materials. </p><p>Yadudu cited a particular polling station in Bichi LGA, Kano </p><p>State, where voters forcibly recovered ballot papers from a </p><p>voting clerk who claimed that all ballots had been used. </p><p>Some of the ballot papers were later found in his car and </p><p>others were traced to the residence of a government official. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ahmed Jalingo, professor of political science and </p><p>labor activist who monitored elections in Bauchi State, also </p><p>complained of serious irregularities.  Jalingo said a village </p><p>chief is now hiding at the residence of a senior official in </p><p>Bauchi for fear of reprisal by his own community.  The local </p><p>chief ordered his men to assault an ANPP agent only to </p><p>discover that the ANPP agent was the son of his senior </p><p>traditional ruler!  Jalingo said that while the actual ballot </p><p>count in Gamawa LGA was still being conducted, an INEC radio </p><p>announcement reportedly gave a final result for that area. </p><p>All those present at the collation center, including the PDP </p><p>agents, were stunned by the announcement of something they </p><p>had yet to complete. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>AGGRIEVED PARTIES MIGHT NOT GET JUSTICE AT THE TRIBUNALS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>8. (C) Yadudu said election tribunal precedents clearly </p><p>showed that the &judicial process is available to the </p><p>highest bidder.8  However, he supported the idea of going to </p><p>the tribunals &for posterity.8  It was necessary to make a </p><p>historical record, he said.  The opposition might win some </p><p>low-level positions like state and National Assembly seats </p><p>but key elections like governors and President would not be </p><p>overturned no matter what degree of evidence was presented, </p><p>he predicted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Discounting the possibility that the tribunal would be </p><p>transparent and follow the rule of law, Jalingo recounted a </p><p>bitter personal experience he had with electoral tribunals, </p><p>when he ran for governor of Taraba State.  Jalingo recalled </p><p>members of the election tribunal in Taraba asking him to pay </p><p>a higher bribe than his opponent when he petitioned the </p><p>results of the 1991 gubernatorial elections, which he </p><p>narrowly lost to Governor Jolly Nyame. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>PERCEPTIONS THAT USG SUPPORTS OBASANJO BECAUSE OF HIS </p><p>CHRISTIAN BACKGROUND </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Jalingo echoed a popular perception among Northern </p><p>Muslims that the USG supported Obasanjo despite his disregard </p><p>for basic democratic values, like free and fair elections, </p><p>because the President was Christian.  Jalingo speculated </p><p>that, if Obasanjo were Muslim the US would have criticized </p><p>him more heavily for &bastardizing democratic norms.8 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The Ambassador unequivocally denied the assertion, </p><p>stating that the United States supported the democratic </p><p>process and did not play favorites.  The election was for </p><p>Nigerians to decide.  It was not a decision for Washington </p><p>nor was it one Washington sought to make or influence, he </p><p>stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO, BUHARI COMPARED </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Jalingo feared Obasanjo,s &Yoruba-centric8 </p><p>politics and combative style would further divide Nigerians. </p><p>He did not foresee President Obasanjo and Vice President </p><p>Atiku meaningfully reaching out to the opposition and to each </p><p>of the various regions of the country.  While praising Buhari </p><p>for a tough stance against corruption, Jalingo complained </p><p>that Obasanjo,s opposition to corruption was belied by the </p><p>fact that his immediate family and relatives of his wife were </p><p>suddenly immersed in and making fortunes from the oil </p><p>industry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Muhammed, Jalingo and Yadudu also complained that </p><p>Obasanjo, not Buhari, exploited the religious card during the </p><p>Presidential elections.  They pointed out that Obasanjo was </p><p>regularly televised at the Presidential Chapel conducting </p><p>religious services.  Conversely, Muhammed explained that </p><p>Buhari was the first Nigerian leader to limit public funds </p><p>for religious trips.  In 1984, Buhari reduced the number of </p><p>government-funded pilgrims to Saudi Arabia from 150,000 to </p><p>20,000, a policy that attracted sharp criticism throughout </p><p>the North.  Buhari also attempted to limit the growing </p><p>influence of the late Sheikh Abubakar Gumi, founder of the </p><p>vocal and influential Islamic group Izala. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>ALLEGED PLANS BY THE REGIME TO ARREST BUHARI </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Echoing reports from other sources, Muhammed alleged </p><p>that the regime had issued orders to arrest Buhari before the </p><p>May 3 State Assembly elections.  He explained that the main </p><p>reason General Ajibade, the recently removed Director of </p><p>Military Intelligence, was reassigned to Nigerian Institute </p><p>for Policy and Strategic Studies was because Ajibade warned </p><p>the regime of dire consequences if Buhari were arrested. </p><p>Ajibade reportedly told a security meeting, with President </p><p>Obasanjo and Vice President Atiku present, that reports </p><p>reaching his office indicated that Buhari carried most of the </p><p>polling stations where soldiers were voters.  Therefore, a </p><p>regime decision to arrest Buhari could lead to unrest in the </p><p>military and among the general population. </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>INCOMING GOVERNOR OF KANO </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>15. (C) Zainab Kabir, professor of sociology and Muslim </p><p>female activist, said that the new Kano State Governor, </p><p>Ibrahim Shekarau, is a veteran technocrat and probably </p><p>honest; however, most of the ANPP officials around him were </p><p>as corrupt as other politicians.  &He might be the only </p><p>sheep among the wolves,8 she said.  Kabir cited a recent </p><p>incident where some Kano businessmen and politicians offered </p><p>new vehicles, expensive clothes and other inducements to the </p><p>incoming politicians.  Shekarau reportedly rejected the </p><p>offers but his deputy Magaji Abdullahi gathered his share of </p><p>the loot with unabashed relish. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Outgoing Governor Kwankwaso said he feared that the </p><p>lack of experience on the part of Shekarau could make him </p><p>vulnerable to manipulation by politicians within and outside </p><p>Kano.  In previous conversations, Kwankwaso had also </p><p>described Shekarau as a religious hard-liner who would </p><p>strictly impose the Sharia code in Kano. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Many Northerners are upset about the results of the </p><p>April elections.  This is not so much that they really </p><p>supported Buhari but because they bitterly opposed Obasanjo </p><p>and what he represented to them.  He represented a tectonic </p><p>shift of power from the Northwest to the Southwest, from the </p><p>Muslim to the Christian.  Northerners are used to being in </p><p>the driver,s seat of national politics; their current tenure </p><p>in the passenger seat has become very uncomfortable.  They </p><p>cannot help but believe that since Buhari carried the North, </p><p>he should have won the election.  Before this election, a </p><p>maxim in Nigerian politics was that whoever won the North won </p><p>the election.  That maxim is no longer valid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Because of these political antecedents, the loudest </p><p>hue and cry against electoral misconduct has emanated from </p><p>the North.  However, the worst electoral injustices were </p><p>probably committed in the South-South and Southeast, albeit </p><p>in the gubernatorial and National Assembly races.  Most </p><p>Southerners believe or are willing to accept that Obasanjo </p><p>won the Presidency.  Yet, because many Northerners viscerally </p><p>oppose Obasanjo,s reelection, election-related protests and </p><p>violence are more likely to occur in parts of the Northwest </p><p>than any other area of the country (with the Southeast coming </p><p>in second).  This observation begets another.  The election </p><p>intensified ethnic, regional and religious sentiment and has </p><p>exposed unfortunate bigotries on both sides of Nigeria,s </p><p>North-South divide.  For instance, it was disingenuous for </p><p>the Ambassador,s interlocutors in Kano to accuse Obasanjo of </p><p>playing the religious card while claiming Buhari preferred a </p><p>secular deck.  Buhari and his supporters played religion to </p><p>the hilt during the election.  The claim that Obasanjo has </p><p>been Yoruba-centric is partially grounded in fact but it is </p><p>also exaggerated, an end-product of the inflated rhetoric of </p><p>ethnicity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) Essentially, many Northerners are guilty of </p><p>reverse-image ethnic and religious biases for which they </p><p>blame Obasanjo.  Nevertheless, grievances of electoral </p><p>shenanigans are warranted to a large extent.  The PDP sweep </p><p>the elections; the opposition in all parts of the country </p><p>feels cheated.  Obasanjo and his PDP could lessen tension if </p><p>a political settlement could be reached with more of the </p><p>opposition.  This is probably easier in the Southeast and the </p><p>South-South where the readjustment of some National Assembly </p><p>seats and some senior level appointments could provide a fix. </p><p> However, mollifying the North will be a different ballgame </p><p>because the North wants what it once had which is something </p><p>Obasanjo will not give up )-Presidential power and control </p><p>of Nigeria. </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
