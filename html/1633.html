IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE CFU AND THE GOZ ARE QUIETLY MEETING </p><p>TO TRY AND REACH AN AGREEMENT TO END THE STAND-OFF OVER </p><p>LAND.  THE CFU IS PITCHING A PROPOSAL TO THE GOZ WHEREBY </p><p>IT WILL PROVIDE A LIST OF FARMS TOTALING FIVE MILLION </p><p>HECTARES THAT WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR RESETTLEMENT, </p><p>A PORTION OF THEM IMMEDIATELY.  THE GOZ WOULD THEN </p><p>PRIVATELY AGREE TO AN ACQUISITION TIMETABLE SPREAD OVER </p><p>A NUMBER OF YEARS, GIVING THE FARMERS TIME TO WIND-DOWN </p><p>THEIR OPERATIONS.  THE PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS IN THESE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS HINGE ON THE CFU AND COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>DECIDING THAT THEY CAN TRUST THE GOZ TO HONOR AN </p><p>AGREEMENT OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING PROVIDING FAIR </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR THE VALUE OF THE FARMS OBTAINED (NOTE: </p><p>THE FARMERS WILL ACCEPT FAIR COMPENSATION FOR THE </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS, WITH THE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD LATER BE </p><p>COMPENSATED FOR THE VALUE OF LAND IF DONOR OR GOZ FUNDS </p><p>BECAME AVAILABLE FOR THIS.)  MORE CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS </p><p>OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS IS A DEAL THAT WILL ALLOW </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE TO PROCLAIM THAT HE HAS FULFILLED HIS </p><p>PROMISE TO PROVIDE LAND TO THE BLACK MAJORITY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON APRIL 5, ECONOFF MET WITH WILLIAM HUGHES, </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) VICE PRESIDENT FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01276  01 OF 02  091254Z </p><p>REGIONS, AND COLLIN CLOETE, CFU VICE PRESIDENT FOR </p><p>COMMODITIES, TO DISCUSS THE STATUS OF CFU EFFORTS TO RE- </p><p>ENGAGE THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ON THE ISSUE OF </p><p>LAND REFORM.  HUGHES AND CLOETE WERE IN AGREEMENT THAT </p><p>COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CFU AND THE GOZ HAD IMPROVED </p><p>SINCE THE CFU SPECIAL CONGRESS IN MARCH (REFTEL), AND </p><p>SAID THAT THE CFU HAD PRESENTED TO THE GOZ ITS PLAN FOR </p><p>A WAY FORWARD ON THE ISSUE OF LAND REFORM.  HUGHES </p><p>STATED THAT GOZ OFFICIALS WITH WHOM THE CFU HAS MET IN </p><p>THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HAVE BEEN RECEPTIVE TO THE </p><p>CFU\'S PROPOSALS, BUT ADDED THAT THESE OFFICIALS WERE </p><p>"TECHNOCRATS" AND IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT THEY CARRY MUCH </p><p>WEIGHT IN NEGOTIATING AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CFU AND </p><p>THE GOZ. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, A CFU GROUP, LED BY NICK </p><p>SWANEPOEL, THE CO-CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC </p><p>CONSULTATIVE FORUM (NECF) LAND TASK FORCE, HAS MET WITH </p><p>VINCENT HUNGWE, THE PERMANENT SECRETARY IN THE LANDS </p><p>MINISTRY AND THE OTHER CO-CHAIRMAN OF THE NECF LAND TASK </p><p>FORCE, LANDS MINISTER JOSEPH MADE, FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>SIMBA MAKONI, AND VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA, WHO IS </p><p>THE NOMINAL HEAD OF THE GOZ LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT </p><p>EFFORT IN THE CABINET.  THE SWANEPOEL-LED GROUP HAS BEEN </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO SELL THE CFU\'S PROPOSAL ON LAND REFORM TO </p><p>A SUSPICIOUS GOZ THAT CONTINUES TO VIEW ANY PROPOSALS </p><p>FROM THE CFU AND COMMERCIAL FARMERS AS DELAYING TACTICS </p><p>RATHER THAN GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO SUPPORT LAND REFORM. </p><p>ACCORDING TO CLOETE, THE GOZ OFFICIALS HAVE INDICATED A </p><p>DESIRE TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE, BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO </p><p>SEE CONCRETE ACTIONS BY THE CFU.  THESE INCLUDE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01276  01 OF 02  091254Z </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF THE CFU LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GOZ ON THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALITY OF "FAST-TRACK" AND A PUBLIC </p><p>COMMITMENT TO IDENTIFY FIVE MILLION HECTARES OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMLAND FOR RESETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CLOETE SAID THAT THE REQUEST TO WITHDRAW THE CFU </p><p>LAWSUIT IS A MOOT POINT.  THE SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY </p><p>RULED ON THE SUIT AND HAS FOUND IN FAVOR OF THE CFU AND </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS.  HOWEVER, THE CFU HAS PROMISED THAT </p><p>IT WILL NOT PURSUE A RULING OF CONTEMPT </p><p></p></div>
