<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 ABUJA 001408 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 5/2/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, KPAO, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ENGAGING ISLAM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 61142 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: By far the most strategically </p><p>important country in West Africa, Nigeria is a major </p><p>economic partner to the United States (oil imports) </p><p>and has been a cooperative player in conflict </p><p>resolution in the sub-region. Africa\'s most populous </p><p>state and largest democracy, Nigeria has supported the </p><p>war against terrorism, but most Muslims oppose our </p><p>policies in the Middle East. While Islamic </p><p>fundamentalism exists here, its followers constitute a </p><p>small minority. Most Nigerian Muslims are pro- </p><p>democracy and do not oppose the United States; they </p><p>are "conservative" Muslims. However, chronic </p><p>inequalities in the political economy could fertilize </p><p>radicalism. Northern Nigeria, where most Muslims live, </p><p>lags behind the South in education, economic activity </p><p>and modernization. Our policy objectives should be to </p><p>engage the Government to address the primarily socio- </p><p>economic problems that lead to radicalism. Mainly, we </p><p>need to promote economic growth in the non-oil </p><p>sectors, particularly agriculture. We also need to </p><p>promote education in the North.  Lastly, we must </p><p>better educate Muslims about America, our foreign </p><p>policies and our approach to religious diversity and </p><p>tolerance at home.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Home to Africa\'s largest Muslim population, </p><p>Nigeria is not an "Islamic State" nor is radical Islam </p><p>a major current here. Roughly half of Nigeria\'s 120 </p><p>million people are Muslim, 40 percent are Christian </p><p>with the remainder adhering to local traditional </p><p>religions. Mostly Sunni and followers of the Maliki </p><p>School, Nigeria\'s Muslims are primarily in the </p><p>Northern half of the country. The South is </p><p>predominately Christian except for the Southwest, </p><p>where the Yoruba ethnic group is split equally between </p><p>Muslim and Christian. Islam in West Africa was first </p><p>established in Nigeria (Borno) and the territorial </p><p>expansion of the Sokoto caliphate under Usman Dan </p><p>Fodio in the early 19th century is a source of pride </p><p>for many Muslims. Due to these historic antecedents, </p><p>Nigerian Muslims see Northern Nigeria as the epicenter </p><p>of Islam in West Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Most Nigerian Muslims are not anti-democratic. </p><p>After nearly 16 consecutive years of military </p><p>governments headed by Muslim generals, democracy </p><p>returned in 1999 with the election of President </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo, a born-again Yoruba Christian who </p><p>professes a deeply held faith. The Muslim North </p><p>supported both the return of democratic rule and </p><p>Obasanjo\'s candidacy. Presidential elections are </p><p>slated for early 2003. While Obasanjo\'s support in the </p><p>North has waned, perhaps considerably, the vast </p><p>majority of Northerners still endorse democratic </p><p>civilian rule. Their estrangement from Obasanjo has </p><p>more to do with his perceived tribalism and nothing to </p><p>do with opposition to the democratic form of </p><p>government because of Islamic religious principles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Despite most Nigerians\' pro-democratic outlook, </p><p>Islam in Nigeria presents important policy challenges </p><p>for the U.S. The most topical challenges have been </p><p>Muslim attitudes toward USG policies in the Middle </p><p>East and, to a much lesser extent, our military action </p><p>in Afghanistan. While Nigeria\'s Muslims condemn </p><p>terrorism and 9/11, many suspect that USG foreign </p><p>policy is inherently anti-Islamic because of the </p><p>United States\' predominately Western political and </p><p>cultural heritage. Prominent Islamic figures have </p><p>sounded this theme and public demonstrations in Kano, </p><p>Katsina and Abuja against USG policy have occurred </p><p>recently. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In addition to Muslim opposition to our </p><p>policies in the Middle East, the advent of criminal </p><p>Sharia codes in twelve Northern states, the incidence </p><p>of communal violence since 1999 and their implications </p><p>for democracy also impact long-term USG policy </p><p>interests in Nigeria. Paradoxically, the return of </p><p>democratic rule in 1999 facilitated the introduction </p><p>of criminal Sharia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. C) Criminal Sharia may appear to be a product of </p><p>Islamic radicalism. However, its emergence actually </p><p>resulted from the combination of political opportunism </p><p>and the socio-economic angst of large segments of the </p><p>population in the north where traditional legal </p><p>structures and law enforcement decayed due to neglect </p><p>by successive military regimes. In short, Sharia began </p><p>as a tack employed by embattled politicians to bolster </p><p>their popularity. However, these politicians </p><p>underestimated the populist reaction. Many Nigerians </p><p>have felt they were being left behind by the dynamics </p><p>of the global economy and modernity. (The IMF and, to </p><p>a lesser degree, the WTO are convenient bogeymen in </p><p>Nigeria.) Many Nigerians also have been frustrated by </p><p>homegrown inequities, particularly the gulf between </p><p>rich and poor. Moreover, they have been disappointed </p><p>in a secular justice system perceived as favoring the </p><p>affluent and allowing them to live above the law. </p><p>Additionally, Muslims worried about the spread of </p><p>evangelical Christianity into traditionally Muslim </p><p>areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Against this backdrop, the call for Sharia is </p><p>more "conservative" and "defensive" than it is </p><p>radical. Feeling that change and modernity have been </p><p>more enervating than empowering, some Muslims have </p><p>looked with false nostalgia to a past that never </p><p>actually existed. For, the more historically minded, </p><p>Sharia harks back to when the Sokoto Caliphate was at </p><p>its zenith. For them, Sharia does not mean just harsh </p><p>criminal punishments; more importantly, it is the </p><p>avenue for the return of the practice of giving </p><p>charity to the poor (zakkat), the prohibition against </p><p>usury and the swift application of justice </p><p>notwithstanding one\'s station in life. In short, </p><p>Sharia\'s appeal is that the wealthy cannot be a law </p><p>unto themselves but they must help the common and the </p><p>poor. This may have serious political consequences for </p><p>the GON in the future, if action is not taken to </p><p>narrow economic disparities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Notwithstanding Sharia\'s primarily </p><p>"conservative" nature, it is evidence of incipient </p><p>political and economic fermentation in Nigeria. </p><p>Nigeria\'s small but incrementally growing circle of </p><p>Islamic radicals endorse Sharia\'s promulgation, seeing </p><p>it as a fillip to expand fundamentalism. Part of this </p><p>fermentation has been the level of communal violence </p><p>experienced since the return of democratic rule. Much </p><p>of the violence was sparked by competition between </p><p>ethnic groups over control of local government and </p><p>scarce resources such as land and water. However, the </p><p>violence often assumed a religious dimension when </p><p>competing ethnic groups were from different religions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Many Nigerians perceive a clash of religions </p><p>taking place in their country. Some staunch Muslims </p><p>talk of bringing Sharia into the Southwest, where </p><p>there are large numbers of co-religionists. </p><p>(Generally, the Yoruba Southwest has been tolerant, </p><p>with intermarriage between the faiths common. </p><p>However, there is evidence of growing religious </p><p>agitation in that region as in many other areas.) </p><p>Conversely, evangelical Christianity is a potent </p><p>stream, coursing into Northern areas that have been </p><p>the traditional reserve of Islam. The Evangelicals </p><p>received succor and funding from sister churches in </p><p>the West, including the United States. Likewise, some </p><p>Muslim fundamentalists receive support or training </p><p>from Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Sudan, and Pakistan. In </p><p>many places in the Middle Belt, fundamentalist Islam </p><p>and Christianity collide. Exacerbating pre-existing </p><p>squabbles over control of resources and local </p><p>government, this clash of religious expansionism has </p><p>helped foment communal violence in many instances. </p><p>Compounding the clash of religions is the gap between </p><p>socio-economic conditions in the mainly Christian </p><p>South and the Muslim North. The North lags behind the </p><p>South in important areas like economic activity, </p><p>infrastructure, and education. These gaps feed the </p><p>perception that the North and, thus, Muslims are </p><p>losing ground due to the Christian Southerners closer </p><p>economic and cultural ties to the West. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Herein lies the crux of Nigeria\'s challenge </p><p>with Islam. The fundamental problem facing the country </p><p>is economic; there is not enough bread, butter or </p><p>jobs. Yet, many Nigerians view events through a </p><p>religious prism. If poverty is not replaced by </p><p>economic growth over time, poor Muslims might begin to </p><p>see the Western-led modern economy as stacked against </p><p>them, in part due to their religious orientation. </p><p>Nigeria\'s conservative Islam could yield to the more </p><p>radical strain here that promotes anti-Americanism. </p><p>Since America stands at the military and economic </p><p>pinnacle, it would be easier to blame America for </p><p>purposely engineering their socio-economic stagnation </p><p>than to attribute their troubles to more proximate </p><p>domestic conditions at home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p>--------------- </p><p>11. (C) Economic and agricultural reform is one of the </p><p>Mission\'s primary objectives and accounts for </p><p>approximately $35 million in assistance this year. </p><p>Assistance has encouraged immediate economic reform in </p><p>some areas, with the GON undertaking significant steps </p><p>to privatize parastatals and liberalize the downstream </p><p>petroleum sector. However, the GON has been reluctant </p><p>to move forward on the exchange rate regime </p><p>(overvalued Naira), tariff reform, agricultural </p><p>policies, and fiscal discipline. The Mission supports </p><p>reform-minded private sector groups such as the </p><p>Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce and Industry and </p><p>the Nigerian Economic Summit Group, and promotes </p><p>reform with larger bodies such as the Manufacturers </p><p>Association of Nigeria (MAN) and the Nigerian Chamber </p><p>of Commerce, Industry, Mining and Agriculture. In </p><p>addition to continuing current assistance, we </p><p>requested USD 5 million in ESF to fund a </p><p>public/private partnership in Kano, the North\'s </p><p>largest city. The home of tens of thousands of </p><p>unemployed youth, Kano is a potential source of </p><p>radicalism unless its depressed economy can improve. </p><p>Because of Kano\'s strategic importance, we want to </p><p>encourage private business to invest in the local </p><p>economy in order to promote economic growth and </p><p>generate employment opportunities for the jobless. </p><p>Additionally, we would like to increase technical </p><p>assistance to Nigeria\'s moribund agricultural sector. </p><p>Most Nigerians and most Northerners are employed in </p><p>this sector. Yet, agricultural production declined </p><p>under years of policy neglect by past military </p><p>governments. Improvement in agriculture will lift </p><p>Northern Nigeria\'s economy, provide food security and </p><p>help check radicalism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>POLITICAL REFORM </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) The biggest challenge to democracy is not </p><p>Islamic radicalism but the return of the military </p><p>should democracy be seen as dysfunctional, unable to </p><p>deliver practical dividends to the populace. With most </p><p>Nigerians already believing in democracy, our strategy </p><p>is to help secure democratization, primarily through </p><p>the conduct of fair elections in 2003, improving </p><p>governance and promoting the rule of law. The upcoming </p><p>Presidential and National Assembly elections are key </p><p>to democracy\'s longevity. Consequently, we are funding </p><p>technical assistance for the Independent National </p><p>Electoral Commission and the State Electoral </p><p>Commissions to help ensure they have the technical </p><p>expertise to conduct fair elections. Promoting good </p><p>governance, we have programs with the National </p><p>Assembly and several State Assemblies, including </p><p>Katsina and Adamawa in the North. We are also </p><p>assisting the Federal Government\'s special anti- </p><p>corruption unit. To help advance the rule of law and </p><p>administration of justice, we fund court management </p><p>programs for three State High Courts (including </p><p>Kaduna). We have also initiated a police-training </p><p>program that brings the concept of community policing </p><p>to Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS: Mission programs have </p><p>effectively assisted new democratic institutions adopt </p><p>better procedures and have helped place key issues, </p><p>such as women\'s rights and freedom of information, on </p><p>legislative agendas (the former more in the South than </p><p>in the North). Historically, however, we have paid </p><p>more attention and allocated more resources to </p><p>development in the Christian South than the Muslim </p><p>North. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- REACTION OF HOST GOVERNMENT AND EFFECT ON OTHER </p><p>INITIATIVES: We have seen little negative reaction to </p><p>our programs. One exception was the publication of the </p><p>results of an USAID-funded public opinion survey </p><p>indicating that most Nigerians believed there was </p><p>significant corruption in the GON. At one point, GON </p><p>officials requested we issue a public disclaimer that </p><p>the survey was not a USG product but the work of </p><p>private academicians. Because of this incident, Post </p><p>will move delicately on USG-funded public awareness </p><p>projects dealing with corruption and other sensitive </p><p>issues. However, this incident has not impeded </p><p>assistance to the anti-corruption unit. There have </p><p>been some suspicion of U.S.-supported projects in the </p><p>North, especially those related to HIV/AIDS and polio </p><p>eradication. However, this suspicion is diminishing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- DONOR COORDINATION: Mission coordinates democracy </p><p>and governance assistance with other donors to avoid </p><p>duplication; this has helped overall donor efficiency. </p><p>With regard to the 2003 elections, we will work in </p><p>greater concert with other donors to coordinate our </p><p>policy positions and public and private diplomacy as </p><p>well as the assistance programs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- OPPOSITION FIGURES: Mission has regular contact </p><p>with opposition figures at all levels. There has been </p><p>no negative GON reaction to this engagement. </p><p>Sensitivity to contact with "the opposition" may grow </p><p>as the 2003 elections approach. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p> EDUCATIONAL REFORM </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Education in Northern Nigeria lags behind the </p><p>rest of the country. We need to significantly increase </p><p>our assistance to education in the North, particularly </p><p>the universities located in the region. Currently, </p><p>Post provides information technology assistance to </p><p>Nigerian Universities. ECA information technology </p><p>programs have supported Bayero University, Ahmadu </p><p>Bello University, the University of Jos, and the </p><p>University of Ibadan. (Three of the four mentioned </p><p>universities are in the North.) The close ties with </p><p>universities developed by USIS and PAS over the years </p><p>have paid dividends. No Vice-Chancellor doubts our </p><p>commitment to helping Nigeria\'s universities. Yet, </p><p>while they know our "will," they do wonder about our </p><p>"wallet." There are several cost-effective steps that </p><p>we can take to further help the schools. More </p><p>programming in information technology should be </p><p>developed for the Northern universities. Also, book </p><p>and database grants need to be increased. We should </p><p>encourage more links to universities in the United </p><p>States through College/University Affiliation Programs </p><p>(CUAP). In addition to our assistance to universities, </p><p>the USAID-funded Literacy Enhancement Assistance </p><p>Programs (LEAP) aims to improve literacy and numeracy </p><p>in both Qur\'anic and public schools. Last, extra </p><p>funding could be employed to improve vocational </p><p>education and literacy/numeracy in Northern cities </p><p>like Kano and Kaduna. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- RESISTANCE TO CHANGING EDUCATIONAL PARADIGMS: While </p><p>the Nigerian government supports university autonomy, </p><p>the Union of University Academic Staff resists the </p><p>shift, fearing it will lead to budget cuts. </p><p>Universities have been urged to institute tuition </p><p>fees, a move students and parents vehemently oppose. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- USG ALIGNMENT TO EDUCATIONAL REFORM: Universities </p><p>have openly opposed IMF loans for university reform. </p><p>The schools complain Nigeria should not borrow money </p><p>either from the World Bank or IMF because it would </p><p>give the IFIs control over university education in </p><p>Nigeria. While LEAP, the program to improve literacy </p><p>and numeracy in both Qur\'anic and public schools, has </p><p>not been resisted by state and local governments, it </p><p>could be falsely characterized by some as an attempt </p><p>to manipulate Qur\'anic education. Mindful of this </p><p>concern, we have worked with Islamic scholars in </p><p>developing the LEAP curriculum. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL INDICATORS: Chronic student and </p><p>faculty strikes have adversely impacted Nigerian </p><p>universities. Due to extended strikes, full time </p><p>Nigerian students can spend six-eight years to obtain </p><p>a four-year degree. The brain drain affects the </p><p>quality of education. Although faculty salaries have </p><p>increased in the past few years, highly qualified </p><p>faculty continue to seek opportunities in other </p><p>sectors or overseas. Deteriorating infrastructure and </p><p>physical plant at the universities also hinder </p><p>education. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>CIVIL SOCIETY </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Mission has helped NGOS in the following </p><p>areas: freedom of information, electoral law reform, </p><p>anti-corruption legislation, women\'s rights, and </p><p>conflict mitigation in the important Northern cities </p><p>of Kano and Kaduna. Post would like additional </p><p>resources to expand conflict mitigation and inter- </p><p>faith dialogue in Kano and Kaduna to other areas of </p><p>the North and Middle Belt region. We would emphasize </p><p>the need for nonviolent political activity in the lead </p><p>up to the 2003 elections. In Kaduna and Kano, we also </p><p>would like to bring the conflict mitigation program </p><p>into the primary and secondary schools. Further </p><p>expanding our conflict mitigation efforts, additional </p><p>resources would help us institute a farmer/pastoralist </p><p>dialogue in select areas of the rural North to reduce </p><p>violence between farmers and cattle herders that </p><p>sparks much of the ethno-religious violence in many </p><p>areas. Additionally, we would like more funding to </p><p>provide basic civic education to women\'s groups and </p><p>youth organizations in the North. Establishment of </p><p>micro-credit programs for farmers and women\'s groups </p><p>will help employment and income generation. USAID also </p><p>is working with groups attempting to engage government </p><p>on constitutional reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS: Mission has experienced </p><p>success in promoting dialogue and peace efforts in </p><p>communities where violence has occurred. This includes </p><p>inter-faith (Muslim-Christian) dialogue in Kaduna and </p><p>in Kano. Also, programs promoting women\'s </p><p>participation in local governance have been especially </p><p>effective, albeit more in the South than the North. </p><p>Post would like additional resources to expand </p><p>conflict mitigation and inter-faith dialogue in Kano </p><p>and Kaduna to other areas of the North and Middle Belt </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- HOST GOVERNMENT REACTIONS: There have been no </p><p>negative GON reactions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--NGOs OPEN TO USG INVOLVEMENT: A wide range of NGOs </p><p>are interested in USG funding and cooperation. Human </p><p>and political rights groups and health care </p><p>organizations are very open to USG involvement. </p><p>However, local Muslim clerics in rural communities in </p><p>several Northern states have actively opposed polio </p><p>vaccination efforts as "unIslamic." </p><p>Some Islamic leaders have also criticized family </p><p>planning activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--INVOLVEMENT WITH CIVIL SOCIETY AND </p><p>POLITICAL/ECONOMIC REFORM. Involvement with civil </p><p>society has advanced political and economic reform by </p><p>making government and leaders more responsive to the </p><p>concerns of average Nigerians through the advocacy and </p><p>oversight of these civil society groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- WORKING WITH LOCAL OR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>TO PROMOTE CIVIL SOCIETY: All civil society programs </p><p>are implemented through international NGOs working </p><p>with local NGOs. Although we do not try to conceal the </p><p>fact of USG funding, the indirect funding helps reduce </p><p>the perception that we are trying to manipulate local </p><p>NGOs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>RELIGIOUS MODERATION AND TOLERANCE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Post is engaged with Muslim organizations. We </p><p>also support inter-faith mediation programs. Using the </p><p>American Speaker Program, targeted mailings of policy </p><p>materials, and "Magama" (post\'s Hausa-language </p><p>magazine) we reach Muslim leaders, clerics, </p><p>communities, and centers of Islamic Studies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--POST DIALOGUE WITH HOST GOVERNMENT ABOUT RELIGIOUS </p><p>ISSUES: Several clerics we reach through programs and </p><p>mailings are also government officials or participants </p><p>in a government-run interfaith committee. There also </p><p>has been policy dialogue with senior GON officials </p><p>about Sharia and ethno-religious communal violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--SUCCESSFUL CONTACTS AND PROGRAMS IN PROMOTING DEBATE </p><p>ON RELIGIOUS ISSUES/ COMBATING ANTI-AMERICANISM: </p><p>Regular meetings with key Muslim personalities to </p><p>discuss USG policies are helpful. Public statements </p><p>reiterating USG respect for Islam also carry weight. </p><p>The following programs serve to reach Muslim </p><p>communities: the International Visitor Program, the </p><p>American Speaker Program, the Fulbright Senior Scholar </p><p>and Student Program, the Humphrey Fellowship Program, </p><p>and programs organized by the Office of Citizen </p><p>Exchanges. The American Speaker program particularly </p><p>has been effective in promoting healthy exchanges of </p><p>views and in getting the American perspective across </p><p>to local audiences. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- BEST PRACTICES: The Speaker program: Bringing a </p><p>Muslim-American to talk to Muslims about religious </p><p>issues/religious diversity has been more effective </p><p>than bringing a non-Muslim. A Muslim-American has </p><p>instant credibility that a non-Muslim does not. Short- </p><p>term educational and cultural exchange programs </p><p>directed at youth and teachers would help build </p><p>favorable attitudes, especially in Northern Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--DEGREE OF INFLUENCE USG CAN EXERT ON INTERNAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS DEBATES: Although not nearly as dispositive </p><p>as domestic factors, our influence potentially can be </p><p>significant. Providing authoritative, credible voices </p><p>to discuss religious diversity/tolerance in United </p><p>States is a good step. We would like to initiate </p><p>single country group IV programs with themes such as </p><p>religious freedom in the United States, faith-based </p><p>solutions to social problems such as violence and </p><p>AIDS. Funding to establish links between Islamic </p><p>centers in Nigeria and the United States would </p><p>increase our influence. The VOA Hausa service can do </p><p>more programming about religious tolerance in America. </p><p>We should also explore select cultural events </p><p>compatible with the conservative social environment in </p><p>the North. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Additionally, private diplomacy encouraging tolerance </p><p>and dialogue also can influence key figures in both </p><p>Christian and Muslim communities.  Events, such as the </p><p>very successful Iftar dinner the Ambassador hosted </p><p>last December, generated significant goodwill with </p><p>leading Muslims. The Iftar and other gatherings with </p><p>Muslim leaders should be replicated.  Consistent and </p><p>regular dialogue that underscores our religious </p><p>impartiality will serve to enhance our influence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ENGAGEMENT: This </p><p>traditionally has not been an effective avenue to </p><p>affect internal debate. However, in that the GON is </p><p>constitutionally required to be religiously neutral, </p><p>there is a potential for cooperation. However, the GON </p><p>usually prefers to conducts its own mediation without </p><p>outside help. Ambassador\'s and Mission outreach to </p><p>Northern state governments, some for the very first </p><p>time, is winning tremendous influence and access to </p><p>key Northern political elites. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>LOOKING AHEAD </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.(C) The transfer of the Embassy from Lagos to Abuja </p><p>has already helped improve our contacts with the North </p><p>and we will continue to exploit the benefits that this </p><p>greater proximity provides. Mission further believes </p><p>that we can more effectively engage Nigeria\'s Muslim </p><p>community via some well-placed additional initiatives. </p><p>Perhaps the most time sensitive and crucial to </p><p>Nigeria\'s overall stability and support for democracy </p><p>is that we should provide adequate assistance to help </p><p>ensure that the 2003 electoral process is credible. </p><p>Over the longer haul, economic growth will be the most </p><p>effective bulwark against radicalism. In this regard, </p><p>we need to help bolster the agricultural sector and </p><p>help generate investment and trade in non-oil sectors </p><p>of the economy, particularly the North and its </p><p>principal city, Kano. To lay a stronger foundation for </p><p>the North\'s inclusion in the modern economy, we should </p><p>dedicate more resources to educational reform, </p><p>especially in Northern universities but also in </p><p>primary and secondary schools. The USG should also be </p><p>leading donor efforts in vocational training and </p><p>literacy/numeracy training. We should also seek ways </p><p>to expand inter-faith mediation efforts to promote </p><p>greater religious tolerance. We must also make greater </p><p>efforts to use public diplomacy, particularly visiting </p><p>speakers, to explain to Nigeria\'s Muslims our Middle </p><p>East Policy, the war on terrorism, and religious </p><p>diversity/tolerance in the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) What we should not do is to be seen as too </p><p>judgmental and self-righteous on issues such as </p><p>Sharia. Our approach must understand that moderate and </p><p>progressive Muslims are working to bring Nigerian </p><p>Sharia in conformity with international human rights </p><p>standards. Our approach must be nuanced; we should </p><p>support their efforts through private diplomacy and </p><p>avoid categorical public statements about Sharia that </p><p>can be construed as anti-Islamic and that undermine </p><p>these progressive Muslims. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
