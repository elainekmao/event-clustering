<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 000728 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/NGA AND NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UN, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UAE DEPUTY PM PANDERS TO PUBLIC </p><p>          OPINION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Abu Dhabi 676 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Thomas </p><p>Williams for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Emirates News Agency reported 2/9 that UAE Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister Shaykh Sultan Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan, on the </p><p>margins of a meeting with visiting former UNSCOM inspector </p><p>Scott Ritter, "stressed the need to allow the UN inspectors </p><p>the opportunity to carry on their search for weapons of mass </p><p>destruction in Iraq."  Sultan was also quoted as saying "the </p><p>region cannot tolerate another war which may result in a </p><p>catastrophe of unpredictable magnitude."  The Deputy PM, who </p><p>is also UAE President Shaykh Zayid\'s second eldest son, used </p><p>this opportunity to call for a lifting of the international </p><p>sanctions on Iraq which he labeled "non-humanitarian" and </p><p>"the causes (sic) of (the) death of thousands of innocent </p><p>Iraqis and of (the) demolition of Iraq\'s economy and </p><p>infrastructure."  Finally, Sultan called on the </p><p>international community to "apply pressure on Israel to stop </p><p>its frenzied war against the Palestinian people." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Ritter\'s 2/8 lecture at the Sultan Bin Zayid- </p><p>sponsored, Arab League-associated, Zayid Center for </p><p>Coordination and Follow-Up received widespread, front-page </p><p>coverage in the UAE press (reftel).  Ritter, who charged </p><p>that the USG was in violation of international law, was </p><p>quoted as saying that more than 95 percent of Iraq\'s WMD </p><p>have been destroyed.  He claimed that the photographs </p><p>presented by the Secretary during his 2/5 UNSC presentation </p><p>were taken during the Iran-Iraq war.  As we previously </p><p>reported, Ritter went out of his way to pan the Secretary\'s </p><p>presentation, claiming that the USG charges are "inaccurate" </p><p>and that Iraq had only one anthrax lab, which was </p><p>"completely eliminated and destroyed" in 1996.  Ritter </p><p>complained that he had been "interrogated by the FBI" who </p><p>"put a lot of pressure on me and accused me of spying for </p><p>Iraq" following his latest Iraq visit.  He then launched </p><p>into a wholesale attack on U.S. policy, comparing it to "a </p><p>car driven by a drunk driver, who is driving aimlessly and </p><p>pushing himself to a disaster." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  As we noted reftel, UAE Armed Forces Chief </p><p>of Staff Muhammad Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan and Information </p><p>Minister Abdullah Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan both privately </p><p>welcomed the Secretary\'s presentation.  Their elder half- </p><p>brother Sultan is the most outspoken of Zayid\'s sons and </p><p>often does not coordinate his statements with the rest of </p><p>the leadership; we have been bluntly informed on at least </p><p>one occasion that Sultan\'s remarks "do not reflect UAEG </p><p>views."  Nevertheless, Sultan frequently reflects popular </p><p>sentiment and he is well aware that the overwhelming </p><p>majority of Emiratis (71 percent according to a recent </p><p>confidential poll) are against military action in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>WILLIAMS </p><p></p></div>
