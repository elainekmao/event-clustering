<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002032 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NEA/ARN, NEA/PPD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: AMIDST EMOTIONS AND ANGER, A FEW CALMER </p><p>VOICES APPEAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 974 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 1685 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 1718 </p><p>     D. AMMAN 1949 </p><p>     E. KUWAIT 1207 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  As we have reported, the anger of most </p><p>Jordanians towards coalition military action against the </p><p>Iraqi regime is obvious and unmistakable (reftels).  However, </p><p>as the war moves into its third week, we are beginning to see </p><p>a "cooling off" among some of our contacts.  One human rights </p><p>contact, not known for his pro-USG-policy views, predicts </p><p>that as soon as Saddam is "clearly finished," the current </p><p>flaring of "Arab pride in the Iraqi resistance" will </p><p>dissipate.  While the rage among the vast majority continues, </p><p>and the media continues to fan the flames with pictures of </p><p>dead Iraqi civilians, some, particularly those in business </p><p>community, are returning to a more pragmatic view of things. </p><p>These individuals are focusing on how to keep businesses </p><p>running and positioned to capitalize on the demise of the </p><p>Iraqi regime. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Despite the "cooling off," even those who have </p><p>accepted the reality (and the virtue) of Saddam\'s demise are </p><p>highly skeptical of our intentions especially toward Syria, </p><p>many are telling us that "people will never look at America </p><p>the same way again."  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>HR ACTIVIST SAYS ANTI-USG SLOGANS </p><p>ARE MORE "TEARS" THAN "FISTS" </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On March 30 PolOff met with human rights activist </p><p>Fawzi Samhoury (strictly protect).  Samhoury has attended </p><p>several professional associations organizational meetings and </p><p>is in contact with opposition figures directing anti-war </p><p>demonstrations.  In his view, the anger against the coalition </p><p>military action is "more tears than fists," and can be </p><p>expected to dissipate once it is clear Saddam is finished. </p><p>Samhoury said the Arab street is desperate for something, </p><p>anything, to restore shattered pride, even if it is a few </p><p>American casualties bannered for hours on Al Jazeera: "Saddam </p><p>is not championing any real \'Arab\' cause, except a display of </p><p>defiance and resistance.  If his resistance goes away, what </p><p>does he have to offer the Arab street?  I believe he is </p><p>finished as soon as the Arabs realize he is finished." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Samhoury observed that so far, the Iraqi regime has </p><p>been able to transmit its propaganda effectively to the Arab </p><p>street, but said many are beginning to admit that, while both </p><p>western and Arab media are "both biased toward their </p><p>constituents," reality is beginning to set in.  Some </p><p>Jordanians are asking, among themselves, why the Iraqi regime </p><p>talks about civilian deaths and American casualties but never </p><p>discusses Iraqi military losses.  Samhoury told PolOff "when </p><p>an angry Jordanian tells you he believes the Iraqis more than </p><p>he believes the Americans, he might believe what he is </p><p>saying, but he also knows this is a way to insult you." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On demonstrations, Samhoury said the turnout and </p><p>virulence is less than the April 2002 rallying during the </p><p>Israeli military activity in Jenin.  He said many people, </p><p>particularly Palestinian-Jordanians, are less upset than they </p><p>were at the Jenin "massacres."  But, he noted, this may be </p><p>due to the fact that people here are worn-out from two years </p><p>of crises and lack the stomach or energy to take to the </p><p>street en masse, especially when the GOJ has made clear it </p><p>will not allow any "unlicensed" demonstrations.  He also </p><p>cautioned that, while the demonstrations may be weaker than </p><p>expected, the anger is still there, and directly "100 </p><p>percent" at America for the first time. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>SOME PRAGMATISTS ARE FOCUSING ON MOVING FORWARD </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Some, especially in the middle/upper-middle class </p><p>business community, want the war to be over with so they can </p><p>proceed with their endeavors (note: this appears to track </p><p>with reporting from at least one other moderate Arab state - </p><p>reftel e).  One young industrialist told us recently that he </p><p>has truckloads of goods packaged, loaded, and waiting on </p><p>trucks in his warehouse, ready to move into Iraq "the day the </p><p>war is over."  Another noted that some local businesses are </p><p>using the war as an excuse for business losses that are more </p><p>likely attributed to poor management, adding that some of his </p><p>clients are using the war as an excuse to delay payments. </p><p>For him, the sooner the war is over, the better. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  A successful Jordanian pharmaceutical importer said </p><p>he has been more worried in the past week about how to get </p><p>his colleagues to focus on the business opportunities in a </p><p>new Iraq than on how many civilians have been killed or who </p><p>will win the war ("The U.S. will win, no doubt").  Most </p><p>Jordanian businessmen, he said, either cannot accept that </p><p>Saddam Hussein will be defeated, or "see the glass half empty </p><p>-- that they would profit on the bodies of dead Iraqis.  I </p><p>see it half full, that I can play a role in helping Iraqis </p><p>rebuild their country."  He recounted a story of an Iraqi </p><p>friend from school who was "a real Baathi" in the 1970\'s. </p><p>This friend "escaped" from Iraq three years ago, the </p><p>businessman said, and has been recounting stories of </p><p>corruption, mismanagement, and regime brutality ever since. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  An NGO contact and an academic told PolCouns this </p><p>week that, while emotionally very affected by the scenes in </p><p>the Arab media of civilian casualties, they understand the </p><p>brutal nature of the Iraqi regime and the reasons the U.S. </p><p>decided to act with military force.  That said, they were </p><p>uncomfortable because the U.S. "is not sending a clear </p><p>message" about the ultimate goal of U.S. military action. </p><p>Does the U.S., they asked, want to disarm Saddam, liberate </p><p>the Iraqi people, or transform Middle Eastern governments </p><p>into democracies?  All of these are laudable goals which will </p><p>(eventually) gain support among Arabs, if the U.S. is clear </p><p>in articulating its purpose.  His big fear (and that of some </p><p>others we talk to) is that we will come up dry in our search </p><p>for WMD.  As our industrialist contact in para 6 put it, </p><p>"please, please, for everyone\'s sake, find the chemical </p><p>weapons.  You have to come up with something." </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>WHO IS NEXT, SYRIA? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Pragmatism aside, many of those within the small group </p><p>that has begun to "cool off" emotionally tell us flatly that </p><p>America will never be viewed the same way again, and its </p><p>intentions will be doubted for a long time.  Some are worried </p><p>about "media reports" that Saddam has moved WMD into Syria. </p><p>This rumor has already spun up a few to predict that "Syria </p><p>will be next," or that these reports will be used by Israel </p><p>as a "pretext" to reoccupy the Golon Heights, "and perhaps </p><p>beyond." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>THE "ANTIDOTE", ACCORDING </p><p>TO JORDANIANS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) While the presumption of bad intentions is nearly </p><p>universal, most are quick to suggest the best way for the USG </p><p>to regain credibility here is to move forward on the </p><p>"Roadmap" with concrete steps, as opposed to "mere words." </p><p>This recurring sentiment has been expressed to EmbOffs at </p><p>various levels and from a wide cross-section of Jordanians. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  While the street will remain volatile during </p><p>hostilities, and many people will likely be angry at us </p><p>beyond the end of the war, a small number of Jordanians -- </p><p>mostly educated and well-off -- are beginning to return to </p><p>their daily lives, and think about "what\'s next."  The </p><p>business community in particular (notwithstanding the </p><p>comments in para 7) has been fairly pragmatic about the </p><p>disruptions of war and about the likely opportunities that </p><p>will follow an end to the conflict (septels). </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
