(SBU) Delta Airlines, which prior to the start of the Iraq </p><p>operation ran four flights per week from Istanbul to New </p><p>York, will suspended its Istanbul-New York flights for one </p><p>month, from April 6 to May 2.  Delta\'s Istanbul Station </p><p>Manager, Giray Salgirtay, told econoff the suspension was an </p><p>economic decision in response to low passenger loads since </p><p>the start of the war.  For example, he said, the March 31 </p><p>Istanbul-New York flight had only 80 passengers, with 110 </p><p>empty seats.  Salgirtay said Delta Headquarters would </p><p>reassess the situation on April 23 to determine whether or </p><p>not to resume flights in May. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Turkish Airlines (THY), on the other hand, has not </p><p>yet cut any of its direct Istanbul-U.S. flights, which </p><p>include flights 7 days per week to New York and 3 days per </p><p>week to Chicago.  THY is, however, considering cutting the </p><p>Istanbul-New York route to 4 days per week, based on </p><p>decreased passenger loads since the start of the war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Meanwhile, indirect flights from Turkey to the U.S. </p><p>through Europe remain frequent and plentiful.  From Ankara, </p><p>THY flies directly to Munich, Berlin, Koln, Copenhagen, </p><p>Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Vienna throughout the week.  From </p><p>Istanbul, THY, Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, Cross </p><p>Air, and Iberian Airlines fly to Munich, Frankfurt, London, </p><p>Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Brussels, Vienna, and Zurich almost </p><p>daily (in some cases twice daily).  There is wide seat </p><p>availability on most of these flights.  Lufthansa is </p><p>reportedly planning to cut its twice-daily Istanbul-Frankfurt </p><p>flight to once-daily, and British Airways may also cut some </p><p>twice daily flights to once per day, in response to decreased </p><p>passenger loads. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
