(U) This is an interim response to reftel. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Embassy had alerted the GOK to the GRF asset </p><p>freeze on October 20, but despite repeated attempts, </p><p>Embassy was only recently able to get the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs to confirm that it had forwarded the </p><p>request for a freeze to the Central Bank of Kuwait </p><p>(CBK).  Embassy reminded the MFA that the request for </p><p>the freeze action was accompanied by a request for </p><p>information on any assets found and/or frozen; the MFA </p><p>said it would follow up again with the CBK.  Post has </p><p>not yet been able to confirm that the CBK has received </p><p>the order, nor whether the CBK has issued a circular to </p><p>banks and financial institutions to serach for and </p><p>freeze any GRF accounts. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Ambassador raised this issue in a November 19 </p><p>meeting with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs </p><p>Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah, pointing out that such </p><p>delays defeated the purpose of such freeze actions. </p><p>Attributing the delay to bureaucratic error, Dr. </p><p>Mohammed agreed that in a world where money can be moved </p><p>in an instant, swift action was required.  He indicated </p><p>he would follow up to ensure that future requests were </p><p>acted upon in a more timely manner. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Embassy will continue to follow up with the CBK </p><p>and MFA to determine the existence and status of any GRF </p><p>accounts in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
