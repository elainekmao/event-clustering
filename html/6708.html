Embassy point of contact on trafficking in persons </p><p>is Poloff Marlene M. Menard, office: + 971 (0)2 </p><p>4436691 ext. 2502, fax: + 971 (0)2 4434771; unclass </p><p>email: menardmm2@state.gov. </p><p> </p><p>2.  OMB Reporting Requirements:  One FS-04 officer </p><p>spent about 30 hours writing the report.  One FS-04 </p><p>officer spent 3 hours reviewing and clearing the </p><p>report.  Two FS-02 officers spent a total of four </p><p>hours reviewing and clearing the report.  One FS-01 </p><p>officer spent two hours reviewing and clearing the </p><p>report. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Following is Post\'s submission of the 2003 </p><p>Trafficking in Persons Report for the United Arab </p><p>Emirates covering the reporting period of April 2003 </p><p>- April 2003. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Overview of a country\'s activities to eliminate </p><p>trafficking in persons: </p><p> </p><p>-- A.  Is the country a country of origin, transit or </p><p>destination for international trafficked men, women, </p><p>or children?  Does the trafficking occur within the </p><p>country\'s borders?  Does it occur in territory outside </p><p>of the government\'s control (e.g., in a civil war </p><p>situation)?  Are any estimates or reliable numbers </p><p>available as to the extent or magnitude of the </p><p>problem?  Please include any numbers of victims.  What </p><p>is (are) the source(s) of available information on </p><p>trafficking in persons?  How reliable are the numbers </p><p>and these sources?  Are certain groups of persons more </p><p>at risk of being trafficked (e.g., women and children, </p><p>boys versus girls, certain ethnic </p><p>groups, refugees, etc.)? </p><p> </p><p>The UAE is a destination country for internationally </p><p>trafficked women and boys.  Trafficking does not </p><p>occur within the UAE\'s borders.  There is no UAE </p><p>territory outside of the government\'s control. </p><p> </p><p>There are no verified numbers available as to the </p><p>extent of the problem.  Reports by NGOs and </p><p>intergovernmental organizations contain estimates on </p><p>the parameters of the problem in the UAE based on </p><p>research conducted in source countries, which rely </p><p>heavily on surveys and interviews of women and </p><p>anecdotal evidence.  These reports also tend to </p><p>reflect estimates of the number of victims trafficked </p><p>to the UAE over the years.  While such estimates and </p><p>information can be useful in defining the problem\'s </p><p>general historical parameters, they are less useful </p><p>in determining the number of persons trafficked to </p><p>the UAE during the current reporting period. </p><p> </p><p>Groups of persons that tend to be more at risk of </p><p>being trafficked to the UAE include:  boys for use as </p><p>camel jockeys and women for purposes of prostitution. </p><p> </p><p>Foreign diplomats report that many child camel </p><p>jockeys in the UAE came here with their parents </p><p>because of dire economic conditions back home or were </p><p>sold by their families to unscrupulous middlemen from </p><p>the source country who arrange for their travel to </p><p>the UAE.  There are no statistics or estimates as to </p><p>how many boys were actually kidnapped and trafficked </p><p>here and how many came here with or with the full </p><p>knowledge and consent of their families. </p><p> </p><p>Many women engaged in prostitution in the UAE </p><p>reportedly voluntarily and knowingly travel to and </p><p>from the UAE for temporary stays, during which they </p><p>engage in prostitution and possibly other activities </p><p>connected with organized crime.  There are few </p><p>statistics or estimates as to how many of the women </p><p>engaging in prostitution in the UAE were actually </p><p>trafficked here and how many came here and stayed of </p><p>their own volition. </p><p> </p><p>-- B.  Where are the persons trafficked from?  Where </p><p>are the persons trafficked to? </p><p> </p><p>NGOs report that boys for use as camel jockeys are </p><p>trafficked to the UAE primarily from South Asia, </p><p>namely, Pakistan and Bangladesh. </p><p>NGOs and intergovernmental organizations report that </p><p>women who have traveled to the UAE for purposes of </p><p>prostitution are brought here mostly from countries in </p><p>Central Asia and Eastern Europe, namely, Russia, the </p><p>Kyrgyz Republic, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, </p><p>Uzbekistan, as well as from Iran and Morocco.  There </p><p>are also reports that women from China have traveled </p><p>to the UAE for purposes of prostitution.  As noted in </p><p>paragraph A above, there are no verified statistics as </p><p>to how many women traveling to the UAE for purposes of </p><p>prostitution are actually trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p>-- C.  Have there been any changes in the direction or </p><p>extent of trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>Since research on the issue of trafficking in persons </p><p>to the UAE is limited, it is difficult to determine </p><p>whether there have been any changes in the direction </p><p>or extent of trafficking to the UAE.  Because there is </p><p>no baseline of information on trafficking in persons </p><p>to the UAE, the reports published over the past </p><p>several years in Central Asian and Eastern European </p><p>source countries help shed light on the scope of the </p><p>problem, but are of little benefit in determining </p><p>whether there have been any changes in the direction </p><p>or extent of trafficking to the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>UAEG officials expect that the child camel jockey ban </p><p>effective 1 September 2002 will impact the extent of </p><p>trafficking in boys to the UAE because it will </p><p>eliminate the market for child camel jockeys and the </p><p>corresponding incentive to traffic boys to the UAE for </p><p>this purpose.  UAEG officials acknowledge that they </p><p>have not yet achieved 100 percent compliance with the </p><p>ban, but stress that they are earnestly working </p><p>towards attaining this goal through inspections at </p><p>races. </p><p> </p><p>-- D.  Are any efforts or surveys planned or underway </p><p>to document the extent and nature of trafficking in </p><p>the country?  Is any additional information available </p><p>from such reports or surveys that was not available </p><p>last year? </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG is currently conducting a general amnesty </p><p>program in an attempt to address illegal migration </p><p>into the country.  The amnesty program, from January </p><p>through April 2003, allows persons who have </p><p>overstayed their visas or who entered the country </p><p>without visas to leave the country without penalty of </p><p>prosecution for immigration violations. </p><p> </p><p>So that the UAEG can better monitor immigration </p><p>patterns in the future, the UAEG is updating its </p><p>immigration databases with information received from </p><p>a questionnaire to be completed by all amnesty- </p><p>seekers.  The questionnaire includes questions on how </p><p>the amnesty applicants arrived in the country, who </p><p>assisted them in coming and staying here, what they </p><p>have been doing and whether they have been working </p><p>while here, etc.  Immigration officials indicated </p><p>that questionnaires completed by amnesty-seekers </p><p>containing information suggesting criminal activity, </p><p>including trafficking in persons, are referred to law </p><p>enforcement authorities for investigation. </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG has also instituted the use of retinal scans </p><p>to add biometrics identification information to its </p><p>databases.  Biometrics information will help UAEG </p><p>authorities better monitor migration and combat </p><p>document fraud by visitors and illegal immigrants, </p><p>for example, the use of false names and birthdays in </p><p>passports and other identification papers. </p><p> </p><p>Labor Ministry officials indicated that statistical </p><p>information received from the general amnesty program </p><p>would help them identify labor law violation </p><p>practices and trends so that they can better manage </p><p>the labor market and protect worker rights. </p><p> </p><p>The amnesty program is not designed specifically to </p><p>determine the extent or the magnitude of trafficking </p><p>in persons to the UAE.  However, UAEG officials state </p><p>that statistical analyses based on amnesty program </p><p>information will provide them with a foundation from </p><p>which they can monitor trafficking in persons and </p><p>estimate the magnitude of the problem. </p><p> </p><p>-- E.  If the country is a destination point for </p><p>trafficked victims:  What kind of conditions are the </p><p>victims trafficked into?  Are they forced to work in </p><p>sweatshops, agriculture, restaurants, construction </p><p>sites, prostitution, nude dancing, domestic servitude, </p><p>begging, or other forms of labor, exploitation, or </p><p>services?  What methods are used to ensure their </p><p>compliance?  Are the victims subject to violence, </p><p>threats, withholding of their documents, debt bondage, </p><p>etc.? </p><p> </p><p>NGO and IOM reports and anecdotal evidence indicate </p><p>that conditions for trafficking victims are varied. </p><p> </p><p>In the past, credible sources reported that almost </p><p>all camel jockeys were boys between the ages of 4 and </p><p>10, some of whom were trafficked to the country by </p><p>small, organized gangs.  The traffickers obtained the </p><p>youths, usually from poor families in Pakistan and </p><p>Bangladesh, by kidnapping, or in some instances by </p><p>buying them from their parents outright or taking </p><p>them under false pretenses, and then smuggling them </p><p>into the country.  Some children reported being </p><p>beaten while working as jockeys, and others were </p><p>injured seriously during races.  Some of the boys </p><p>were underfed to make them as light as possible.  The </p><p>boys often did not receive compensation for their </p><p>services since many times the trafficker posed as the </p><p>child\'s parent and received the child\'s salary from </p><p>the camel farm owner. </p><p> </p><p>Reports and anecdotal evidence indicate that women </p><p>trafficked to the UAE were often brought to the </p><p>country under the false pretense of legitimate </p><p>employment, but then were forced into prostitution. </p><p>It is unclear whether the women actually signed </p><p>contracts of employment or traveled to the UAE based </p><p>on employment promises only.  When the women arrived </p><p>in the country, the traffickers did not provide the </p><p>promised employment, took their passports, and forced </p><p>them to engage in prostitution to repay their travel </p><p>and other expenses.  Some of these women were confined </p><p>to residences.  Because the traffickers only paid the </p><p>women small amounts of money, the women found it </p><p>difficult to repay these debts.  The traffickers also </p><p>warned the women that they would be arrested if they </p><p>sought help from the police or others for immigration </p><p>violations or other criminal offenses.  Some women </p><p>were threatened with physical abuse. </p><p>-- F.  If the country is a country of origin:  Which </p><p>populations are targeted by the traffickers?  Who are </p><p>the traffickers?  What methods are used to approach </p><p>victims?  (Are they offered lucrative jobs, sold by </p><p>their families, approached by friends of friends, </p><p>etc.?)  What methods are used to move the victims </p><p>(e.g., are false documents being used)? </p><p>The UAE is not a country of origin for trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>-- G.  Is there political will at the highest levels </p><p>of government to combat trafficking in persons?  Is </p><p>the government making a good faith effort to seriously </p><p>address trafficking?  Is there a willingness to take </p><p>action against government officials linked to TIP?  In </p><p>broad terms, what resources is the host government </p><p>devoting to combating trafficking in persons (in terms </p><p>of prevention, protection, prosecution)? </p><p> </p><p>Senior government leadership exhibited strong </p><p>political will to combat trafficking in persons, and </p><p>the UAEG made a concerted good faith effort to </p><p>seriously address trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>In an effort to eradicate the trafficking of boys to </p><p>the UAE for use as camel jockeys, the UAEG announced </p><p>in July 2002 that it would criminalize the decades- </p><p>long practice of employing child camel jockeys </p><p>effective 1 September 2002.  This ban was announced </p><p>despite strong resistance from some tradition-bound </p><p>camel farm owners.  The Government also tightened </p><p>controls at points of entry into the country for boys </p><p>under the age of 15 years and mandated the </p><p>repatriation of child camel jockeys in the UAE to </p><p>their home countries for reunification with their </p><p>families. </p><p> </p><p>In October 2002, Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan sent </p><p>letters to various source countries\' foreign </p><p>ministers, asking for their cooperation and </p><p>coordination in addressing this transnational crime </p><p>of humanitarian concern. </p><p> </p><p>In November 2002, UAEG officials engaged in </p><p>discussions on trafficking in persons with USG </p><p>officials at the first U.S.-UAE Strategic Dialogue </p><p>held in Washington, D.C.  In February 2003, Minister </p><p>of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayed </p><p>Al Nahyan wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Colin </p><p>Powell, as a follow-up, and reiterated the UAEG\'s </p><p>commitment to fighting trafficking in persons.  In </p><p>that letter, the Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs also advised the Secretary of the creation of </p><p>a new UAE trafficking in persons task force. </p><p> </p><p>UAEG political will was further apparent during the </p><p>U.S. State Department official visit of Sally </p><p>Neumann, G/TIP, and Barbara Keary, NEA/RA, to the UAE </p><p>in January 2003.  During the visit, the USG officials </p><p>met with high-ranking officials from the Ministries </p><p>of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Justice, Health and </p><p>Labor and the Dubai Police Department, including the </p><p>Dubai Police Human Rights Department Director.  The </p><p>Emirati officials all confirmed the UAEG\'s commitment </p><p>to monitor and combat trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG senior leadership has repeatedly requested </p><p>information on training opportunities that </p><p>specifically address combating trafficking in </p><p>persons, to help law enforcement officials, </p><p>prosecutors and judges better identify, investigate </p><p>and prosecute trafficking in persons cases.  After </p><p>receiving information on USG training opportunities </p><p>in February 2003, Post presented the information to </p><p>the Office of the Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs, which forwarded the information to the </p><p>Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Justice for </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p>There are no reports that UAEG officials are linked </p><p>to trafficking in persons.  In the past, the UAEG has </p><p>investigated and prosecuted government officials </p><p>suspected of committing criminal offenses, e.g., </p><p>embezzlement and fraud.  This willingness to take </p><p>action against government officials suspected of </p><p>illegal activity indicates that the UAEG would take </p><p>action against government officials linked to </p><p>trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>-- H.  Do governmental authorities or individual </p><p>members of government forces facilitate trafficking, </p><p>condone trafficking, or are otherwise complicit in </p><p>such activities?  If so, at what levels?  Do </p><p>government authorities (such as customs, border </p><p>guards, immigration officials, local police, or </p><p>others) receive bribes from traffickers or otherwise </p><p>assist in their operations?  What punitive measures, </p><p>if any, have been taken against those individuals </p><p>complicit or involved in trafficking?  Please provide </p><p>numbers, when available, of government officials </p><p>involved, accused, convicted and/or prosecuted. </p><p> </p><p>Government policy does not facilitate or condone </p><p>trafficking.  There are no reports that governmental </p><p>authorities or individual members of government forces </p><p>facilitate trafficking, condone trafficking, or are </p><p>otherwise complicit in such activities.  There are </p><p>also no reports that government authorities receive </p><p>bribes from traffickers or otherwise assist in their </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p>In the past, the UAEG has investigated and prosecuted </p><p>government officials suspected of committing criminal </p><p>offenses, e.g., embezzlement and fraud.  Because of </p><p>this willingness to take action against government </p><p>officials suspected of illegal activity, it is </p><p>expected that the UAEG would take action against </p><p>government authorities that facilitate trafficking, </p><p>condone trafficking, or are otherwise complicit in </p><p>such activities, or that receive bribes from </p><p>traffickers or otherwise assist in their operations. </p><p> </p><p>-- I.  What are the limitations on the government\'s </p><p>ability to address this problem in practice?  For </p><p>example, is funding for police or other institutions </p><p>inadequate?  Is overall corruption a problem?  Does </p><p>the government lack the resources to aid victims? </p><p> </p><p>There are no limitations on the UAEG\'s ability to </p><p>address trafficking in persons.  The Government has </p><p>taken many concrete steps to fight trafficking in </p><p>persons to the UAE, and it is expected that the UAEG </p><p>will successfully achieve its goal to fully monitor </p><p>and combat trafficking in persons in a reasonable </p><p>amount of time.  However, certain factors limit the </p><p>UAEG\'s ability to take actions within a short period </p><p>of time. </p><p> </p><p>The UAE gained its independence in 1971.  Although a </p><p>young country, it has transcended rapidly from an </p><p>undeveloped country to a dynamic regional economic </p><p>power with an advanced infrastructure and a diverse </p><p>urbanized population with residents from about 201 </p><p>different countries.  The UAE is also an open country </p><p>with a vibrant tourism industry, and is a busy transit </p><p>hub for international travel and trade.  As a result </p><p>of the country\'s rapid modernization and growth, the </p><p>federal Government is increasingly tasked with </p><p>responding to complex issues of international concern, </p><p>many of which involve foreign organized criminal </p><p>groups, including terrorism, money laundering, as well </p><p>as trafficking in persons, drugs, arms, and weapons of </p><p>mass destruction. </p><p> </p><p>A loose federation comprised of seven individual </p><p>emirates, the UAEG is governed by consensus of the </p><p>seven emirates\' rulers.  The federal Government </p><p>asserts primacy in matters of foreign and defense </p><p>policy, some aspects of internal security, and </p><p>increasingly in matters of law and the supply of some </p><p>government services.  However, the loose federal </p><p>structure and requirement for consensus impacts quick </p><p>action on some matters. </p><p> </p><p>The bureaucratic process to pass legislation, accede </p><p>to international treaties or create national </p><p>strategies can sometimes be lengthy.  The Justice </p><p>Ministry oversees the passage of new legislation and </p><p>accession to bilateral or multilateral treaties.  An </p><p>inter-ministerial Technical Committee works to draft </p><p>agreed language, which then goes for approval to a </p><p>second inter-ministerial Political Committee that </p><p>includes representatives from each Emirate.  The </p><p>Political Committee is charged with achieving </p><p>consensus on the draft language from the seven </p><p>emirates.  Once consensus is achieved, the draft </p><p>language is presented to the Federal National Council </p><p>(FNC) for debate and consideration.  Once the FNC </p><p>concludes its consideration, it makes a recommendation </p><p>on the draft language to the federal Cabinet, which </p><p>then reviews and considers the draft language for </p><p>passage into law. </p><p> </p><p>Despite the normally lengthy process involved with </p><p>passing new legislation, the Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs led the effort to criminalize the use </p><p>of child camel jockeys in record time.  The </p><p>announcement of the child camel jockey ban in July </p><p>2002 was made only months after he decided to lead the </p><p>effort to criminalize the use of child camel jockeys. </p><p>Our interlocutors report that he pushed the ban </p><p>through the bureaucracy because of his desire to </p><p>terminate this practice before the beginning of the </p><p>next camel racing season in October 2002. </p><p> </p><p>Consistent enforcement of laws throughout the country </p><p>is sometimes affected by the relative independence of </p><p>security and police forces in each emirate.  While all </p><p>emirate internal security organs theoretically are </p><p>branches of one federal organization, in practice they </p><p>operate with considerable independence.  And, each </p><p>emirate maintains its own independent police force. </p><p> </p><p>Some cultural characteristics also hamper the </p><p>Government\'s ability to immediately address some </p><p>trafficking in persons issues.  For example, camel </p><p>racing is a traditional sport.  In the past, camel </p><p>owners or their sons raced camels.  Over the years, </p><p>boys have been increasingly used as camel jockeys, </p><p>many of whom are offered for employment to camel </p><p>owners by their parents.  The UAEG leadership states </p><p>that they are working to change attitudes that accept </p><p>the use of boys as camel jockeys.  Because this change </p><p>will take time, the UAEG leadership acknowledges that </p><p>they have not yet been able to achieve total </p><p>compliance with the ban, but are working earnestly to </p><p>meet this goal through inspections at races. </p><p>The country has the resources to adequately fund its </p><p>police and other institutions and to aid victims. </p><p>However, federal ministry and local department budgets </p><p>are determined on an annual basis.  Consequently, </p><p>although the UAE is a wealthy country, the institution </p><p>of new programs may be required to wait until the next </p><p>budget grant when monies can be allocated for those </p><p>new programs. </p><p> </p><p>There have been a few cases of officials prosecuted </p><p>for public corruption.  However, public corruption in </p><p>the UAEG is not a major problem and should not detract </p><p>from the UAEG\'s ability to tackle trafficking in </p><p>persons. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Prevention: </p><p> </p><p>-- A.  Does the government acknowledge that </p><p>trafficking is a problem in that country?  If no, why </p><p>not? </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG acknowledges that trafficking in persons is a </p><p>problem.  The senior leadership has noted a number of </p><p>times that this transnational crime must be addressed </p><p>for humanitarian as well as national security reasons. </p><p>Emirati officials have described trafficking in </p><p>persons as a disease that must be eradicated before </p><p>more people are victimized.  UAEG officials also </p><p>recognize that a failure to attack organized crime in </p><p>this area opens the country to organized crime in </p><p>other areas, such as drugs or weapons.  Officials in </p><p>Dubai were shocked, for instance, by the recent </p><p>gangland-style murder of a prominent Dubai-based </p><p>Indian businessman with connections to the underworld. </p><p> </p><p>In October 2002, Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan sent </p><p>letters to various source countries\' foreign </p><p>ministers, asking for their cooperation and </p><p>coordination in addressing trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>In November 2002, UAEG officials engaged in </p><p>discussions on trafficking in persons with USG </p><p>officials at the first U.S.-UAE Strategic Dialogue </p><p>held in Washington, D.C.  In February 2003, Minister </p><p>of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayed </p><p>Al Nahyan wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Colin </p><p>Powell, as a follow-up, and reiterated the UAEG\'s </p><p>commitment to fighting trafficking in persons.  In </p><p>that letter, the Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs also advised the Secretary of the creation of </p><p>a new trafficking in persons task force. </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG\'s acknowledgment of trafficking to the UAE </p><p>was apparent during the U.S. State Department official </p><p>visit of Sally Neumann, G/TIP, and Barbara Keary, </p><p>NEA/RA, to the UAE in January 2003.  The USG officials </p><p>met with high-ranking officials from the Ministries of </p><p>Foreign Affairs, Interior, Justice, Health and Labor. </p><p>They also met with officers from the Dubai Police </p><p>Department, including the Dubai Police Human Rights </p><p>Department Director.  The Emirati officials all </p><p>acknowledged that trafficking in persons to the UAE is </p><p>a problem and sought engagement on the issue.  The </p><p>UAEG officials briefed the USG officials on Government </p><p>actions that impact and combat trafficking in persons </p><p>and requested assistance in other areas. </p><p>-- B.  Which government agencies are involved in anti- </p><p>trafficking efforts? </p><p> </p><p>Both federal ministries and local emirate departments </p><p>are involved in anti-trafficking efforts.  Some </p><p>efforts are specifically designed to combat </p><p>trafficking in persons.  Other efforts are not </p><p>specifically designed to combat trafficking in persons </p><p>but have that effect because such efforts help in the </p><p>prevention of trafficking, prosecution of trafficking, </p><p>and protection of trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p>On the federal level, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, </p><p>Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of </p><p>Health, Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and </p><p>Ministry of Information are involved actively in anti- </p><p>trafficking efforts.  On the local level, the police </p><p>departments, immigration departments, and social </p><p>services departments are also involved. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is actively involved </p><p>in a number of anti-trafficking efforts.  In July </p><p>2002, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs led </p><p>the campaign to eradicate the trafficking of boys for </p><p>use as camel jockeys by announcing a ban on child </p><p>camel jockeys with criminal penalties for violators, </p><p>mandating the repatriation of boys currently in the </p><p>country working as child camel jockeys to their home </p><p>countries for reunification with their families, and </p><p>ordering increased security measures by immigration </p><p>officials at ports of entry. </p><p> </p><p>The child camel jockey ban prohibits the use of camel </p><p>jockeys less than 15 years of age and who weigh less </p><p>than 45 kilograms (99 pounds).  The Government </p><p>established the following penalties for violators of </p><p>the child camel jockey ban: first offense, fine of </p><p>approximately $5,500 (20,000 dirhams); second offense, </p><p>ban from participation in camel races for one year; </p><p>third and subsequent offenses, imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG implemented the age and weight requirements </p><p>by requiring all camel jockeys to apply for and </p><p>receive a government-issued identification (ID) card. </p><p>To verify the ID card applicant\'s age and guard </p><p>against document fraud, e.g., a passport that </p><p>indicates the child is 15 years when he is actually </p><p>only 12 years, the UAEG issues ID cards only after a </p><p>positive physical examination by a medical committee </p><p>through the use of x-rays and other tests that confirm </p><p>that the child is at least 15 years of age.  In </p><p>January 2003, the UAEG instituted an additional </p><p>requirement of DNA tests to further guard against </p><p>document fraud and apprehend traffickers by ensuring </p><p>that the person presenting the boy for ID application </p><p>is in fact the biological parent of the child.  UAEG </p><p>officials indicate that if the person presenting the </p><p>boy for ID application is not the biological parent of </p><p>the child, then the application is referred to law </p><p>enforcement authorities for investigation for </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>The Government is enforcing the child camel jockey ban </p><p>through inspections at races.  Although UAEG officials </p><p>state that they have not yet achieved 100 percent </p><p>compliance with the child camel jockey ban, the </p><p>Government officials indicate that they are working </p><p>earnestly to achieve this goal. </p><p> </p><p>In October 2002, the Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs contacted the Ministers of Foreign Affairs for </p><p>various source countries, initiating bilateral </p><p>cooperation and coordination in monitoring and </p><p>combating trafficking in persons and in repatriation </p><p>of victims.  UAE Embassies in source countries also </p><p>contacted the governments of the source countries in </p><p>this regard. </p><p>In February 2003, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>announced the creation of a new trafficking in </p><p>persons task force.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>is currently considering the best method to </p><p>institutionalize follow-up on monitoring and </p><p>combating trafficking in persons.  An option under </p><p>consideration includes an office to coordinate and </p><p>follow-up on ministries\' actions.  The UAEG is also </p><p>currently considering membership in the International </p><p>Organization for Migration (IOM). </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs coordinated the </p><p>attendance of two Emirati officials, one representing </p><p>the Ministry of Justice and one representing the Dubai </p><p>Police Department, at the February 2003 "Pathbreaking </p><p>Strategies in the Global Fight Against Sex </p><p>Trafficking" Conference in Washington D.C.  The MFA is </p><p>also currently shepherding information on USG training </p><p>opportunities on trafficking in persons to the </p><p>Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Justice. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Justice took the lead in the UAEG\'s </p><p>accession in December 2002 to the UN Convention </p><p>Against Transnational Organized Crime.  The Ministry </p><p>of Justice is also currently taking the lead in the </p><p>UAEG\'s consideration and reported upcoming accession </p><p>to that Convention\'s Supplemental Protocol to Prevent, </p><p>Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially </p><p>Women and Children, and Supplemental Protocol Against </p><p>the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Justice\'s Institute for Judicial </p><p>Training and Studies includes mandatory courses for </p><p>prosecutors and judges on subjects that generally </p><p>impact trafficking in persons, including human rights, </p><p>sex offenses, immigration violations and labor </p><p>violations.  Justice Ministry officials requested and </p><p>are currently considering information on training </p><p>opportunities that specifically address trafficking in </p><p>persons, namely the recently-released USDOJ OPDAT </p><p>trafficking in persons training program that we </p><p>provided to the Ministry of Justice as soon as it was </p><p>available.  The Ministry of Justice purview includes </p><p>prosecutors as well as judges.  A representative from </p><p>the Ministry of Justice, the Chief Prosecutor in Al </p><p>Ain, Abu Dhabi Emirate, attended the February 2003 </p><p>"Pathbreaking Strategies in the Global Fight Against </p><p>Sex Trafficking" Conference in Washington D.C. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Justice officials report that they are </p><p>reviewing U.S. legislation and the Trafficking </p><p>Protocol to determine whether UAE existing legislation </p><p>covers all aspects of trafficking in persons.  If not, </p><p>then Ministry of Justice officials indicate that a </p><p>determination will be made as to whether supplemental </p><p>legislation will suffice or whether new comprehensive </p><p>legislation on trafficking in persons is warranted. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding the child camel jockey ban, the Ministry of </p><p>Health organized the medical committees that conduct </p><p>the medical tests to estimate the age of the camel </p><p>jockey identification applicants.  The Ministry of </p><p>Health also conducts the applicant/parent DNA testing. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Health officials acknowledge the health </p><p>problems affecting trafficking victims, especially </p><p>HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, and the </p><p>possible resulting public health issues.  The Health </p><p>Ministry maintains social workers/counselors in all </p><p>public hospitals to which medical personnel refer </p><p>patients when sexual or other abuse is suspected.  The </p><p>social workers/counselors are also available for </p><p>consultation by patients in the absence of such </p><p>suspicion.  The local police departments also maintain </p><p>officers in public hospitals that are immediately </p><p>accessible in the event a patient is suspected to be a </p><p>victim of a criminal offense. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Health issues annual health cards to </p><p>workers, which they initially receive after passing a </p><p>physical examination upon arrival to the UAE.  The 300 </p><p>dirhams (about $82) health cards are provided by </p><p>employers to employees for free medical treatment and </p><p>medication to employees and their dependents at public </p><p>hospitals.  Annual physical exams for employees are </p><p>required to renew the health cards.  Domestic servants </p><p>are subject to these annual exams even though they are </p><p>not covered by the Labor Code.  During this exam, </p><p>medical personnel with specialized abuse-detection </p><p>training make inquiries and look for signs of sexual </p><p>or physical abuse.  The Ministry of Health also makes </p><p>available at public hospitals brochures about domestic </p><p>violence and sexual and physical abuse with </p><p>information on who to contact for help or assistance. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Health officials also report that the </p><p>Ministry actively conducts health education outreach </p><p>to community associations (many of the more than 201 </p><p>nationalities resident in the UAE have community </p><p>associations) and foreign embassies.  In March 2003, </p><p>the Ministry of Health announced that it would soon </p><p>begin widespread distribution of a booklet on </p><p>communicable diseases, covering their causes, </p><p>treatment and how to report them to authorities. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs manages the </p><p>work force and labor market and enforces compliance </p><p>with the labor law through inspections.  The Ministry </p><p>of Labor and Social Affairs also reviews employment </p><p>contracts for workers in the industrial and service </p><p>sectors to ensure compliance with the labor laws. </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs </p><p>began distributing an information booklet to foreign </p><p>workers outlining their rights under the labor law and </p><p>how to pursue labor disputes, whether individual or </p><p>collective.  The booklet includes information on work </p><p>permits, employment contracts and labor cards, private </p><p>recruitment agencies, work hours and leave, </p><p>compensation for work injuries and occupational </p><p>diseases, labor disputes, employment contract </p><p>termination, end of service benefits, transfer of </p><p>sponsorship and repatriation.  The booklet also </p><p>contains contact information for the Ministry of Labor </p><p>and addresses and telephone numbers for all foreign </p><p>missions in the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Labor officials stated that they </p><p>distributed the information booklets to embassies and </p><p>consulates in the UAE, focusing on those with large </p><p>numbers of citizens working here, and requested the </p><p>foreign diplomats to assist in the distribution of the </p><p>information booklets to their citizens already present </p><p>and working in the UAE.  Ministry of Labor officials </p><p>also requested the foreign missions to assist in </p><p>providing the information booklets to prospective </p><p>employees in their countries prior to their departure </p><p>for the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>Employees may file individual employment dispute or </p><p>collective work dispute complaints with the Ministry </p><p>of Labor.  Press reports continually reflect the </p><p>active involvement of the Labor Ministry in resolving </p><p>such disputes.  In individual complaints, the employee </p><p>may file a complaint with special labor courts if the </p><p>Labor Ministry is unable to mediate a resolution by </p><p>agreement of the parties.  The Labor Ministry also </p><p>mediates collective work disputes.  However, if the </p><p>Labor Ministry is unable to successfully mediate a </p><p>collective work dispute, the dispute is referred to a </p><p>Labor Ministry Conciliation Committee for arbitration. </p><p>Either party may appeal the Conciliation Committee\'s </p><p>decision to a Labor Ministry Supreme Committee of </p><p>Conciliation, whose decision is final. </p><p> </p><p>In May 2001, the Government introduced a new law </p><p>requiring some employers to deposit monetary </p><p>guarantees with third-party banks.  The purpose of the </p><p>guarantee was to decrease the growing number of cases </p><p>in which employees worked, sometimes for months, </p><p>without wages.  The amount of the guarantee increased </p><p>according to the number of workers employed by the </p><p>depositor.  In May 2002, the Labor Ministry announced </p><p>that the institution of bank guarantees to protect </p><p>rights of workers had been mostly successful as the </p><p>number of labor disputes, especially in companies that </p><p>were required to deposit large bank guarantees, had </p><p>decreased.  After reports that some employers were </p><p>making their employees pay the amount of the bank </p><p>guarantee, in September 2002 the Labor Ministry </p><p>publicly warned employers that such actions were labor </p><p>law violations because employers are responsible for </p><p>providing the bank guarantees and that it would take </p><p>strict action against companies that deducted the </p><p>value of the bank guarantee from their workers\' </p><p>salaries. </p><p> </p><p>In May 2002, the Labor Ministry announced it would not </p><p>tolerate the violation of the rights of workers, </p><p>especially those of low-income laborers, and increased </p><p>and intensified inspections.  In August 2002, the </p><p>Labor Ministry announced that 215 companies had been </p><p>blacklisted (suspended from submitting applications </p><p>for new work permits or sponsorship transfers) and </p><p>fined for labor law violations.  In September 2002, </p><p>the Labor Ministry blacklisted a company for failure </p><p>to comply with an agreement with the Ministry to pay </p><p>outstanding backpay of five months to 300 workers. </p><p> </p><p>In response to inspections revealing a high incidence </p><p>of labor law violations by private companies, in June </p><p>2002 the Labor Ministry announced the creation of a </p><p>special task force to inspect all industrial </p><p>establishments in the private sector.  In November </p><p>2002, 54 additional labor inspectors began work, </p><p>increasing the number of labor inspectors to about </p><p>120.  Labor inspectors review a number of items </p><p>during inspection, including payment of wages, hours </p><p>worked, safety and health requirements.  The </p><p>inspections include a review of business records as </p><p>well as employee interviews.  In February 2003, the </p><p>Labor Ministry announced that it had prepared </p><p>guidelines for labor inspectors as part of a </p><p>comprehensive plan to upgrade inspections. </p><p> </p><p>In an effort to reduce the practice of "sham" </p><p>companies, which apply for and receive work permits </p><p>for employees but do not actually provide them with </p><p>employment, a special committee appointed by the </p><p>federal Cabinet Committee reviewed data provided by </p><p>the Ministry of Labor and released a report in </p><p>November 2002 with recommendations on how to </p><p>eliminate this practice, including stricter scrutiny </p><p>of commercial license and work permit applications. </p><p> </p><p>In March 2003, Labor Ministry officials announced a </p><p>new requirement for private companies to reduce the </p><p>incidence of unpaid wages and "sham" companies.  Upon </p><p>request from the Labor Ministry, private companies </p><p>must furnish periodic reports, certified by </p><p>professional auditors, showing regular payment of </p><p>workers\' salaries and/or the location of workers </p><p>sponsored by the company, whether working for the </p><p>sponsor company or other companies.  Labor Ministry </p><p>officials stated that these requirements are </p><p>currently being applied to construction and </p><p>maintenance companies.  Other types of companies, </p><p>however, may be required to submit these reports in </p><p>the future if they fail to pay workers\' salaries </p><p>regularly as required by employment contracts and the </p><p>labor law.  Companies that do not comply with this </p><p>new reporting requirement will be blacklisted -- </p><p>their commercial licenses will be suspended and they </p><p>will be banned from obtaining new employment visas. </p><p>Non-compliant companies will also be subject to fines </p><p>and/or imprisonment of their owners/managers for </p><p>labor code violations as provided by law. </p><p> </p><p>In February 2003, the Ministry of Labor announced the </p><p>completion of a draft proposal expressly authorizing </p><p>the creation of labor and trade unions.  Once </p><p>approved by the Cabinet, the Ministry plans to </p><p>establish a new department responsible for handling </p><p>matters related to unions.  Groups of twenty or more </p><p>nationals working in a profession or trade will be </p><p>permitted to organize to protect their rights and </p><p>interests; foreign workers in the UAE for more than </p><p>six years will be allowed to join as associate </p><p>members but will not be permitted to vote or contest </p><p>elections.  Organizations will be allowed to join </p><p>Arab or international trade unions and a UAE Unified </p><p>Labor Federation may be established. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, Ministry of </p><p>Health, municipalities, and civil defense work </p><p>together to enforce health and safety standards, and </p><p>the Government requires every large industrial concern </p><p>to employ a certified occupational safety officer. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Information and Culture helped </p><p>increase public awareness with an extensive </p><p>information campaign in the English and Arabic press </p><p>about trafficking in boys for use as camel jockeys. </p><p>The information campaign was conducted in conjunction </p><p>with the announcement of the child camel jockey ban in </p><p>July 2002 and for months thereafter. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Interior oversaw the implementation </p><p>and enforcement of the child camel jockey ban in </p><p>coordination with local governments and police </p><p>departments.  The Ministry of Interior also </p><p>spearheaded the inclusion of DNA testing as a part of </p><p>the camel jockey identification card issuance process. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Interior\'s Department of </p><p>Naturalization and Residency oversees the current </p><p>amnesty program.  It worked closely with the Ministry </p><p>of Labor in designing the program and information- </p><p>gathering questionnaire to better monitor migration </p><p>patterns, including trafficking in persons. </p><p> </p><p>In January 2003, Ministry of Interior officials </p><p>indicated that they continue to work on developing </p><p>channels to exchange information with other </p><p>governments on organized crime, including trafficking </p><p>in persons. </p><p>UAE labor laws do not cover domestic workers and </p><p>agricultural workers.  Consequently, the Ministry of </p><p>Interior\'s Department of Naturalization and Residency </p><p>reviewed the contracts of foreign domestic employees </p><p>as part of residency permit processing to ensure that </p><p>the negotiated salaries and terms are adequate. </p><p> </p><p>To guard against involuntary servitude, in January </p><p>2003, the UAEG announced new regulations requiring a </p><p>mandatory unified contract for domestic workers and </p><p>agricultural workers.  The contract regulates the </p><p>employer-employee relationship and specifies rights </p><p>granted to the employee.  The regulations provide that </p><p>the UAEG review the employer\'s ability to pay the </p><p>worker before the work permit is granted.  The </p><p>regulations also provide that the worker may complain </p><p>of unified contract violations to the Ministry of </p><p>Labor\'s Labor Dispute Department. </p><p> </p><p>In an effort to combat prostitution, the Dubai police </p><p>conduct special patrols in areas frequented by </p><p>prostitutes and the immigration and police forces use </p><p>special units to conduct raids and sting operations in </p><p>areas where prostitutes are known to frequent.  In May </p><p>2002, the Ras Al-Khaimah Emirate police and </p><p>immigration authorities coordinated raids on several </p><p>massage parlors on tips that the parlors were centers </p><p>for prostitution.  Law enforcement authorities state </p><p>that women arrested for prostitution are interviewed </p><p>to determine whether they might be victims of forced </p><p>prostitution or trafficking in persons.  During the </p><p>interview, the officials reportedly ask the women how </p><p>they came to the UAE, who assisted them in traveling </p><p>here and where they have been staying while in the </p><p>UAE. </p><p> </p><p>In April 2003, the Dubai Police Department will host </p><p>an FBI Organized Crime Undercover Operations training </p><p>program at the Middle East Law Enforcement Training </p><p>Center.  Law enforcement officers representing all </p><p>local police departments are expected to attend. </p><p>This specialized training will help to combat </p><p>trafficking in persons to the UAE since organized </p><p>crime groups reportedly commit most trafficking </p><p>offenses. </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, the Dubai Police Human Rights Department </p><p>conducted an outreach program to foreign missions to </p><p>advise of programs and services available to residents </p><p>and visitors.  The Human Rights Department maintains </p><p>an Office of Social Services and Human Rights at </p><p>police stations throughout Dubai Emirate staffed with </p><p>human rights officers and social workers/counselors. </p><p>These officers are available to assist complainants </p><p>and victims, including victims of trafficking in </p><p>persons. </p><p> </p><p>Two members of the Dubai Police Department, the Human </p><p>Rights Department Director and the Al Rashidiya Police </p><p>District Director, attended the State Department\'s </p><p>International Visitor Program on Trafficking in </p><p>Persons in June 2002.  The Dubai Police Department </p><p>Human Rights Director also attended the February 2003 </p><p>"Pathbreaking Strategies in the Global Fight Against </p><p>Sex Trafficking" Conference in Washington D.C. </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, the Dubai Police Human Rights Department </p><p>Director developed a Crime Victims\' Assistance </p><p>Program, which includes the creation of Victim </p><p>Assistance Coordinators and police training in victim </p><p>protection and assistance.  In March 2003, Victim </p><p>Assistance Coordinators were assigned to police </p><p>stations.  Victim Assistance Coordinators\' </p><p>responsibilities include advising victims about the </p><p>criminal justice system and criminal procedure; </p><p>encouraging witness testimony, especially in cases </p><p>involving sexual abuse and trafficking in persons </p><p>where victims are reluctant to speak out; advising </p><p>victims of their rights; providing counseling and </p><p>medical care; placing victims in safehouses or </p><p>shelters; and following-up with victims as the case </p><p>proceeds to trial.  In March 2003, the Dubai Police </p><p>Human Rights Department began conducting Victim </p><p>Protection and Assistance training courses for Dubai </p><p>police officers. </p><p>The Dubai Tourist Security Department operates a 24- </p><p>hour toll-free hotline telephone number to assist </p><p>visitors with inquiries or problems.  The Department </p><p>publishes information on the hotline and precautionary </p><p>measures for visitors in a brochure that is </p><p>distributed at ports of entry and other locations. </p><p> </p><p>The Women\'s Da\'waa Administration in the Dubai </p><p>Department of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs also operates </p><p>a hotline geared for women and children.  Operating </p><p>since July 2002, the hotline is open to all </p><p>nationalities living in all emirates.  The hotline is </p><p>open from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., Saturday to </p><p>Wednesday, but will take emergency calls on Thursday </p><p>and Friday (the UAE weekend). </p><p> </p><p>-- C.  Are there or have there been anti-trafficking </p><p>information or education campaigns?  If yes, briefly </p><p>describe the campaign(s), including their objectives </p><p>and effectiveness. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Information and Culture helped </p><p>increase public awareness with an extensive </p><p>information campaign about trafficking in boys for use </p><p>as camel jockeys in conjunction with the announcement </p><p>of the child camel jockey ban in July 2002 and for </p><p>several months thereafter. </p><p> </p><p>The local press highlights cases of child jockeys </p><p>rescued by local authorities and non-governmental </p><p>organizations.  The local press also reports on cases </p><p>of forced prostitution.  Some local newspapers include </p><p>regular columns with advice on worker rights. </p><p> </p><p>-- D.  Does the government support other programs to </p><p>prevent trafficking?  (E.g., to promote women\'s </p><p>participation in economic decision making or efforts </p><p>to keep children in school.)  Please explain. </p><p> </p><p>In addition to government ministries and departments, </p><p>charitable and other organizations funded by the </p><p>Government and individual ruling family members are </p><p>also involved in programs that help to prevent </p><p>trafficking.  The Government maintained its efforts to </p><p>address humanitarian needs and concerns in the UAE and </p><p>worldwide through government-funded charitable </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p>In the UAE, the primarily government-funded UAE Red </p><p>Crescent Authority, an affiliate of the </p><p>International Federation of the Red Cross and Red </p><p>Crescent Societies, among other activities, </p><p>provided assistance to widows, divorced women, </p><p>prisoners\' wives, orphans, prisoners and students </p><p>from poor families.  Projects funded by the Red </p><p>Crescent Authority include maintaining schools and </p><p>mosques, digging wells, building health units, and </p><p>training for people with special needs. </p><p> </p><p>Outside the UAE, the UAE Red Crescent Authority and </p><p>other charitable organizations funded by individual </p><p>ruling family members, such as the Zayed Foundation </p><p>and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum Humanitarian </p><p>and Charity Establishment, conducted humanitarian </p><p>relief projects and provided reconstruction and other </p><p>types of assistance to a number of countries </p><p>worldwide, including countries in the Middle East, </p><p>Eastern Europe, CIS, Russia, and Africa.  UAE </p><p>President and Abu Dhabi Emirate Ruler Shaykh Zayed Bin </p><p>Sultan Al-Nahyan funds the Zayed Foundation.  Shaykh </p><p>Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum is the Crown Prince of </p><p>Dubai Emirate and UAE Minister of Defense. </p><p>Many of the countries that receive aid from UAE </p><p>charitable organizations are source countries or are </p><p>at risk of becoming source countries for trafficking </p><p>in persons because of poor socio-economic conditions. </p><p>These charitable projects are anti-trafficking in </p><p>nature because they help to support people and </p><p>communities vulnerable to trafficking.  These </p><p>organizations fund a multitude of projects, including </p><p>providing food, clothing, construction equipment, </p><p>telecommunications equipment, heavy machinery, </p><p>electrical generators, transportation equipment, </p><p>vehicles, ambulances, medical supplies, and medicines; </p><p>paying government employees\' and teachers\' salaries; </p><p>providing financial aid to support orphans; conducting </p><p>demining projects; building roads, refugee camps, </p><p>homes, hospitals, schools and orphanages; operating </p><p>refugee camps and orphanages; and digging wells. </p><p> </p><p>The UAE Red Crescent Authority conducts outreach </p><p>programs for displaced persons, focusing on women and </p><p>children.  In 2002, the Authority also sponsored 4,645 </p><p>orphans in Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Somalia, </p><p>Jordan, Bosnia, Ghana, Indonesia, Albania, Kazakhstan, </p><p>Thailand, Mongolia and Ethiopia, at a cost of about </p><p>19.6 million dirhams (more than $5.4 million). </p><p> </p><p>Countries or areas receiving assistance from UAE </p><p>organizations include Pakistan, Afghanistan, </p><p>Palestine, Chechnya, Sudan, Benin, Bangladesh, </p><p>Eritrea, Sudan, Kosovo, Yemen, Philippines, Niger, </p><p>Kazakhstan, Tanzania, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, </p><p>Jordan, Bosnia, Ghana, Indonesia, Albania, Thailand, </p><p>Mongolia, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Algeria, Ghana, Albania, </p><p>Macedonia, and Iran. </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG cooperates with the office of the UN High </p><p>Commissioners for Refugees (UNHCR) and other </p><p>humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.  In </p><p>2000, UAE First Lady Shaykha Fatima bint Mubarak </p><p>established a Fund for Refugee Women to help refugee </p><p>women worldwide, which is managed by the UAE Red </p><p>Crescent Society in cooperation with UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG also cooperates with Medecins Sans Frontieres </p><p>(Doctors Without Borders), which maintains offices in </p><p>the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>-- E.  Is the government able to support prevention </p><p>programs? </p><p> </p><p>The government is able to and does support prevention </p><p>programs both in the UAE and in other countries.  See </p><p>answers to 4.C and 4.D above. </p><p> </p><p>-- F.  What is the relationship between government </p><p>officials, NGOs, other relevant organizations and </p><p>other elements of civil society on the trafficking </p><p>issue? </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG works with foreign embassies and source </p><p>country NGOs to provide shelter and assistance to </p><p>victims and facilitate their repatriation. </p><p> </p><p>The Ministry of Labor works with ILO on various labor </p><p>issues.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently </p><p>considering UAE membership in the inter-governmental </p><p>International Organization for Migration (IOM). </p><p> </p><p>-- G.  Does the government adequately monitor its </p><p>borders?  Does it monitor immigration and emigration </p><p>patterns for evidence of trafficking?  Do law </p><p>enforcement agencies respond appropriately to such </p><p>evidence? </p><p> </p><p>Reports indicate that the UAEG adequately monitors </p><p>its borders against illegal migration and smuggling. </p><p>The Armed Forces are responsible for guarding and </p><p>monitoring the UAE\'s coast and land borders.  The </p><p>border guards also have the legal authority to stop </p><p>and inspect individuals at the border or point of </p><p>entry, especially if the there is suspicion of </p><p>illegal activity.  In January 2002, the UAE began </p><p>erecting a 3-meter fence barrier along its land </p><p>border with Oman in an effort to curb smugglers and </p><p>illegal immigration. </p><p> </p><p>The federal and emirate-level immigration authorities </p><p>are responsible for controlling the influx of people </p><p>at the country\'s international airports.  In August </p><p>2002, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service </p><p>conducted fraud intercept training at Dubai </p><p>International Airport to help immigration authorities </p><p>there better combat document fraud at that point of </p><p>entry into the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>The authorities have recognized that illegal </p><p>immigration and the violation of residency laws, </p><p>whether involving women and children or not, is a </p><p>problem in the UAE.  To that end, the Ministry of </p><p>Interior\'s Department if Naturalization and Residency </p><p>announced in 2000 the establishment of a central </p><p>operations room, including an integrated federal data </p><p>center to track the arrival and departure of </p><p>individuals in the Federation\'s seven emirates.  The </p><p>UAEG has also instituted the use of retinal scans to </p><p>add biometrics identification information to its </p><p>databases.  Biometrics information will help UAEG </p><p>authorities better monitor migration and combat </p><p>document fraud by visitors and illegal immigrants, </p><p>for example, the use of false names and birthdays in </p><p>passports and other identification papers. </p><p> </p><p>In an effort to crack down on border infiltrators and </p><p>immigration violators, in January 2003 the UAEG began </p><p>a four-month amnesty program.  The amnesty program, </p><p>from January through April 2003, allows persons who </p><p>have overstayed their visas or who entered the </p><p>country without visas to leave the country without </p><p>penalty of prosecution for immigration violations. </p><p> </p><p>So that the UAEG can better monitor immigration </p><p>patterns, the UAEG is updating its immigration </p><p>databases with information received from a </p><p>questionnaire to be completed by all amnesty-seekers. </p><p>The questionnaire includes questions on how the </p><p>amnesty applicants arrived in the country, who </p><p>assisted them in coming and staying here, what they </p><p>have been doing and whether they have been working </p><p>while here, etc.  Immigration officials indicate that </p><p>questionnaires containing information that suggests </p><p>criminal activity, including trafficking in persons, </p><p>are referred to law enforcement authorities for </p><p>investigation. </p><p> </p><p>Labor Ministry officials indicate that they will use </p><p>statistical information received from the general </p><p>amnesty program to identify practices and trends that </p><p>violate the labor law or abuse workers so that they </p><p>can better manage the labor market and protect worker </p><p>rights. </p><p> </p><p>Although the amnesty program is not designed </p><p>specifically to determine the extent or the magnitude </p><p>of the trafficking in persons to the UAE, UAEG </p><p>officials state that statistical analyses based on </p><p>amnesty program information will provide them with a </p><p>foundation to actively and effectively monitor </p><p>trafficking in persons and estimate the magnitude of </p><p>the problem. </p><p> </p><p>-- H.  Is there a mechanism for coordination and </p><p>communication between various agencies, such as a </p><p>multi-agency working group or a task force?  Does the </p><p>government have an anti-trafficking in persons task </p><p>force?  Does the government have a public corruption </p><p>task force? </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs led and </p><p>directed inter-ministry coordination and </p><p>communication on trafficking in persons issues.  In </p><p>February 2003, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>announced the creation of a UAE trafficking in </p><p>persons task force. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials state that the </p><p>Government is currently considering the best method </p><p>to institutionalize follow-up on monitoring and </p><p>combating trafficking in persons.  One option under </p><p>consideration includes an office to coordinate and </p><p>follow-up on ministries\' actions. </p><p> </p><p>-- I.  Does the government coordinate with or </p><p>participate in multinational or international working </p><p>groups or efforts to prevent, monitor, or control </p><p>trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>In January 2003, Ministry of Interior officials </p><p>indicated that they continue to work on developing </p><p>channels with other governments to exchange </p><p>information on organized crime, including trafficking </p><p>in persons. </p><p> </p><p>UAEG authorities reportedly cooperated with </p><p>authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh to prevent and </p><p>control trafficking in boys to the UAE by stemming </p><p>the seizure and/or recruitment of these children at </p><p>the source.  Law enforcement officials also reported </p><p>that they cooperate and work in coordination with </p><p>foreign NGOs and foreign governments on trafficking </p><p>in women cases. </p><p> </p><p>Immigration authorities also work with foreign </p><p>embassies and consulates in the repatriation of </p><p>trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p>-- J.  Does the government have a national plan of </p><p>action to address trafficking in persons?  If so, </p><p>which agencies were involved in developing it?  Were </p><p>NGOs consulted in the process?  What steps has the </p><p>government taken to disseminate the action plan? </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs led and </p><p>directed inter-ministry coordination and </p><p>communication on trafficking in persons issues.  The </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs, working in coordination </p><p>with other ministries and departments, created the </p><p>plan of action for the child camel jockey ban and </p><p>other measures related thereto. </p><p> </p><p>In February 2003, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs </p><p>announced the creation of a UAE trafficking in </p><p>persons task force.  The task force reportedly will </p><p>be responsible for creating a formal national plan of </p><p>action regarding trafficking in persons for inter- </p><p>ministry action and follow-up. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials state that the </p><p>Government is currently considering the best method </p><p>to institutionalize follow-up on monitoring and </p><p>combating trafficking in persons.  One option under </p><p>consideration includes an office to coordinate and </p><p>follow-up on ministries\' actions. </p><p> </p><p>-- K.  Is there some entity or person responsible for </p><p>developing anti-trafficking programs within the </p><p>government? </p><p> </p><p>See answer to 4.J. above. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Investigation and prosecution of traffickers: </p><p> </p><p>(For questions a-c, posts should highlight in </p><p>particular whether or not the country has enacted any </p><p>new legislation since the last tip report.) </p><p> </p><p>-- A.  Does the country have a law specifically </p><p>prohibiting trafficking in persons?  If so, what is </p><p>the law?  If not, under what other laws can </p><p>traffickers be prosecuted?  For example, are there </p><p>laws against slavery or the exploitation of </p><p>prostitution by means of coercion or fraud?  Are these </p><p>other laws being used in trafficking cases?  Are these </p><p>laws, taken together, adequate to cover the full scope </p><p>of trafficking in persons? </p><p> </p><p>UAE Penal Law Art. 346 prohibits trafficking in </p><p>persons:  "Whoever brings into or out of the country </p><p>any person intending to possess or dispose of and </p><p>whoever possesses or purchases or sells or offers for </p><p>sale or transacts in any manner of any person as a </p><p>slave shall be punished with provisional </p><p>imprisonment."  Provisional imprisonment is a sentence </p><p>of 3 years minimum and 15 years maximum. </p><p> </p><p>Justice Ministry officials indicate that traffickers </p><p>can also be prosecuted under penal laws, including </p><p>laws prohibiting kidnapping; rape; sodomy; sexual </p><p>abuse; sexual exploitation; immoral acts; exploitation </p><p>of someone for immoral acts; physical abuse; false </p><p>imprisonment; juvenile endangerment; forced labor; </p><p>child labor; forced prostitution; indecency; </p><p>enticement, inducement or deceiving someone to commit </p><p>immoral acts or prostitution; aiding or facilitating </p><p>the commission of immoral acts or prostitution; </p><p>keeping or operating a place for immoral acts or </p><p>prostitution; and money laundering. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Labor officials also report that the UAE </p><p>Labor Law contains penalties for labor law violations. </p><p>UAE Labor Law Art. 181 provides for a fine from 3,000 </p><p>dirhams (about $820) to 10,000 dirhams (about $2700) </p><p>and/or imprisonment up to six months per labor law </p><p>violation or for obstructing, preventing or </p><p>threatening labor inspectors. </p><p> </p><p>UAE law appears to adequately cover the full scope of </p><p>trafficking in persons.  Ministry of Justice </p><p>officials report that they are currently reviewing </p><p>U.S. trafficking in persons legislation and </p><p>evaluating current UAE laws to determine whether </p><p>there are gaps in existing legislation.  If so, </p><p>Justice Ministry officials state that they will then </p><p>determine whether supplemental legislation will be </p><p>adequate or comprehensive trafficking in persons </p><p>legislation will be necessary. </p><p> </p><p>-- B.  What is the penalty for traffickers? </p><p> </p><p>UAE Penal Law Art. 346 provides for imprisonment from </p><p>3 years minimum to 15 years maximum. </p><p> </p><p>-- C.  What are the penalties for rape or forcible </p><p>sexual assault?  How do they compare to the penalty </p><p>for trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>The sentencing range for rape is 15 years plus </p><p>lashings to capital punishment.  The penalty for rape </p><p>that leads to the death of the victim or for rape </p><p>with extenuating circumstances is capital punishment. </p><p> </p><p>-- D.  Has the government prosecuted any cases against </p><p>traffickers?  If yes, provide numbers of arrests, </p><p>indictments, plea bargains, fines, and convictions. </p><p>What were the penalties actually imposed in each case? </p><p>Are the traffickers serving the time sentenced?  If </p><p>no, why not?  Please indicate whether the government </p><p>can provide this information, and if not, why not? </p><p> </p><p>Law enforcement officials claim that cases have been </p><p>prosecuted under the penal laws prohibiting </p><p>trafficking and related crimes.  UAEG officials are </p><p>attempting to compile statistics on arrests, </p><p>prosecutions, and convictions.  We will forward this </p><p>information immediately when it is received. </p><p> </p><p>-- E.  Is there any information or reports of who is </p><p>behind the trafficking?  For example, are the </p><p>traffickers freelance operators, small crime groups, </p><p>and/or large international organized crime syndicates? </p><p>Are employment, travel, and tourism agencies or </p><p>marriage brokers fronting for traffickers or crime </p><p>groups to traffic individuals?  Are government </p><p>officials involved?  Are there any reports of where </p><p>profits from trafficking in persons are being </p><p>channeled?  (E.g. armed groups, terrorist </p><p>organizations, judges, banks, etc.) </p><p> </p><p>IOM and NGO reports indicate that organized crime </p><p>groups are behind most if not all trafficking cases to </p><p>the UAE, with the typical size of the organized crime </p><p>group varying according to the source country. </p><p> </p><p>-- F.  Does the government actively investigate cases </p><p>of trafficking?  (Again, the focus should be on </p><p>trafficking cases versus migrant smuggling cases.) </p><p>Does the government use active investigative </p><p>techniques in trafficking in persons investigations? </p><p>To the extent possible under domestic law, are </p><p>techniques such as electronic surveillance, undercover </p><p>operations, and mitigated punishment or immunity for </p><p>cooperating suspects used by the government?  Does the </p><p>criminal procedure code or other laws prohibit the </p><p>police from engaging in covert operations? </p><p> </p><p>Law enforcement officials report that they actively </p><p>investigate cases of trafficking in persons. </p><p>Investigation is most easily accomplished in cases </p><p>brought to their attention by complaint from the </p><p>victim or other interested party.  Police officials </p><p>state that trafficking in persons investigations are </p><p>challenging when trafficking is suspected but the </p><p>victim refuses to provide information, likely out of </p><p>fear or distress. </p><p> </p><p>Police officials also report that active investigative </p><p>techniques are used in criminal investigations, </p><p>including trafficking in persons cases, and that </p><p>electronic surveillance and undercover operations are </p><p>permitted and used.  Police officials recommend </p><p>sentence mitigation for cooperating suspects and are </p><p>not prohibited from engaging in covert operations. </p><p> </p><p>-- G.  Does the government provide any specialized </p><p>training for government officials in how to recognize, </p><p>investigate, and prosecute instances of trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>On several occasions over the past year, the senior </p><p>leadership requested information on training </p><p>opportunities that specifically address combating </p><p>trafficking in persons, to help law enforcement, </p><p>prosecutors and judges better identify, investigate </p><p>and prosecute cases of trafficking in persons.  After </p><p>receiving information on USG training classes in </p><p>February, Post presented the information to the </p><p>Office of the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, </p><p>which forwarded the information to the Ministry of </p><p>Interior and Ministry of Justice for review. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Justice officials report that the </p><p>Ministry\'s Institute of Judicial Training and Studies </p><p>conducts mandatory classes for prosecutors and judges </p><p>on proper victim care and assistance.  The Institute </p><p>also conducts mandatory specialized classes (with </p><p>course duration in parentheses) on the following </p><p>topics: human rights (14 hours); sexual offenses (20 </p><p>hours); offenses against life (20 hours); immigration </p><p>offenses (20 hours); juvenile protection and </p><p>delinquency (30 hours); labor violations and offenses </p><p>(12 hours). </p><p> </p><p>In April 2003, the Dubai Police Department will host </p><p>an FBI Organized Crime Undercover Operations training </p><p>program at the Middle East Law Enforcement Training </p><p>Center.  Law enforcement officers representing all </p><p>local police departments are expected to attend. </p><p>This specialized training will help to combat </p><p>trafficking in persons to the UAE since organized </p><p>crime groups reportedly commit most if not all </p><p>trafficking offenses. </p><p> </p><p>-- H.  Does the government cooperate with other </p><p>governments in the investigation and prosecution of </p><p>trafficking cases?  If possible, can post provide the </p><p>number of cooperative international investigations on </p><p>trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>UAEG officials state that they cooperate with </p><p>authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh to prevent and </p><p>control trafficking in boys to the UAE by stemming </p><p>the seizure and/or recruitment of these children at </p><p>the source.  Law enforcement officials report that </p><p>they also cooperate and work in coordination with </p><p>foreign NGOs and foreign governments on trafficking </p><p>in women issues when cases are brought to their </p><p>attention. </p><p> </p><p>Immigration authorities work with foreign embassies </p><p>and consulates and foreign NGOs in repatriation </p><p>cases. </p><p> </p><p>In January 2003, Ministry of Interior officials </p><p>indicated that they continue to work on developing </p><p>channels with foreign governments to exchange </p><p>information on organized crime, including trafficking </p><p>in persons. </p><p> </p><p>-- I.  Does the government extradite persons who are </p><p>charged with trafficking in other countries?  If so, </p><p>can post provide the number of traffickers extradited? </p><p>Does the government extradite its own nationals </p><p>charged with such offenses?  If not, is the government </p><p>prohibited by law from extraditing its own nationals? </p><p>If so, what is the government doing to modify its laws </p><p>to permit the extradition of nationals? </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG currently has extradition treaties with a </p><p>number of countries, including India, Sri Lanka, </p><p>Armenia, Canada (for drugs and money-laundering </p><p>charges), China, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Algeria, </p><p>Morocco, Syria, Somalia, Jordan and Egypt.  Between </p><p>1997-2001, 253 suspected criminals were extradited </p><p>from the UAE and 96 suspected criminals were </p><p>extradited to the UAE.  In some cases, extradition was </p><p>performed to and from countries with which the UAEG </p><p>does not currently have an extradition treaty. </p><p> </p><p>In June 2002, UAEG authorities announced that the UAEG </p><p>was discussing extradition treaties with Pakistan, </p><p>Russia, France, Germany, Australia, South Africa and </p><p>Yemen.  In December 2002, the UAEG presented a </p><p>proposed draft extradition treaty to the USG for </p><p>consideration.  In March 2003, UAE-Azerbaijan treaty </p><p>negotiations were announced. </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG also has mutual legal assistance treaties in </p><p>criminal matters with a number of countries.  In June </p><p>2002, UAEG authorities stated that the UAEG had </p><p>delivered 235 files of criminal case documents to </p><p>other countries and had received 145 files of criminal </p><p>case documents from other countries.  In some cases, </p><p>mutual legal assistance was exchanged with countries </p><p>with which the UAEG does not currently have a mutual </p><p>legal assistance treaty.  The USG and UAEG have </p><p>exchanged mutual legal assistance treaty documents and </p><p>will likely commence treaty negotiations this year. </p><p> </p><p>To our knowledge, the UAEG has not requested </p><p>extradition or granted extradition in a case of </p><p>trafficking in persons.  Based on the UAEG\'s record on </p><p>extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal </p><p>matters, it is expected that the UAEG would request or </p><p>grant extradition and mutual legal assistance in </p><p>trafficking in persons cases. </p><p> </p><p>UAEG extradition of a UAE citizen to another country </p><p>is unlikely absent extenuating circumstances.  For </p><p>example, there is reportedly a clause in the UAE-India </p><p>extradition treaty, included at the UAEG\'s request, </p><p>wherein both nations agreed not to extradite their own </p><p>nationals to the other. </p><p> </p><p>-- J.  Is there evidence of government involvement in </p><p>or tolerance of trafficking, on a local or </p><p>institutional level?  If yes, please explain in </p><p>detail. </p><p> </p><p>There is no evidence of government involvement or </p><p>tolerance of trafficking, whether on a local or </p><p>institutional level. </p><p> </p><p>-- K.  If government officials are involved in </p><p>trafficking, what steps has the government taken to </p><p>end such participation?  Have any government officials </p><p>been prosecuted for involvement in trafficking or </p><p>trafficking-related corruption?  Have any been </p><p>convicted?  What actual sentence was imposed?  Please </p><p>provide specific numbers, when available. </p><p>There have been no cases reported of government </p><p>officials involved in trafficking.  Based on previous </p><p>cases of investigation and prosecution of government </p><p>officials for criminal offenses, it is expected that </p><p>the UAEG would investigate and prosecute government </p><p>officials suspected of trafficking or trafficking- </p><p>related corruption. </p><p> </p><p>-- L.  Has the government signed and ratified the </p><p>following international instruments?  Please provide </p><p>the date of signature/ratification if appropriate. </p><p> </p><p>A.  ILO Convention 182 Concerning the Prohibition and </p><p>Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst </p><p>Forms of Child Labor? </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG ratified ILO Convention 182 Concerning Worst </p><p>Forms of Child Labor on 28 June 2001. </p><p> </p><p>B.  ILO Conventions 29 and 105 on Forced or Compulsory </p><p>Labor </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG ratified ILO Convention 29 Concerning Forced </p><p>Labor on 27 May 1982. </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG ratified ILO Convention 105 Concerning </p><p>Abolition of Forced Labor on 24 February 1997. </p><p> </p><p>C.  Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights </p><p>of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child </p><p>Prostitution, and Child Pornography? </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of </p><p>the Child on 3 January 1997, but has not ratified its </p><p>supplemental Option Protocol on the Sale of Children, </p><p>Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography. </p><p> </p><p>D.  The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish </p><p>Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, </p><p>Supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational </p><p>Organized Crime? </p><p> </p><p>The UAE acceded to the UN Convention Against </p><p>Transnational Organized Crime in December 2002. </p><p>Justice Ministry officials report that the UAE has </p><p>reviewed and will likely sign the following </p><p>supplemental protocols in the near future:  (1) the </p><p>Supplemental Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish </p><p>Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and </p><p>Children; and (2) the Supplemental Protocol Against </p><p>the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, See and Air. </p><p> </p><p>E.  Other </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG has also ratified or acceded to the following </p><p>international instruments that help directly or </p><p>indirectly guard against trafficking in persons. </p><p>(Note: Date of ratification or accession in </p><p>parentheses. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>--UN International Convention on the Elimination of </p><p>All Forms of Racial Discrimination (acceded 20 June </p><p>1974). </p><p> </p><p>--Convention Against Slavery (ratification date </p><p>unknown). </p><p> </p><p>--ILO Convention 1 Concerning Hours of Work for </p><p>Industry (ratified 27 May 1982). </p><p>--ILO Convention 81 Concerning Labor Inspection </p><p>(ratified 27 May 1982). </p><p>--ILO Revised Convention 89 Concerning Night Work for </p><p>Women (ratified 27 May 1982). </p><p> </p><p>--ILO Convention 100 Concerning Equal Remuneration </p><p>(ratified 24 February 1997). </p><p> </p><p>--ILO Convention 111 Concerning Discrimination in </p><p>Employment and Occupation (ratified 28 June 2001). </p><p> </p><p>--ILO Convention 138 Concerning Minimum Age for </p><p>Employment (ratified 2 October 1998). </p><p> </p><p>6.  Protection and Assistance to Victims: </p><p> </p><p>-- A.  Does the government assist victims, for </p><p>example, by providing temporary to permanent residency </p><p>status, relief from deportation, shelter and access to </p><p>legal, medical and psychological services?  If yes, </p><p>please explain.  Does the country have victim care and </p><p>victim health care facilities?  If so, can post </p><p>provide the number of victims placed in these care </p><p>facilities? </p><p> </p><p>The Government provides assistance and protection to </p><p>victims, including victims of trafficking in persons. </p><p>Counseling services are available in public hospitals. </p><p>Authorities have worked with embassies and NGOs to </p><p>provide shelter facilities.  Victims may also seek </p><p>shelter in their embassies.  Police Departments also </p><p>reportedly provide shelter facilities for victims </p><p>separate and apart from jail facilities.  Those </p><p>sheltered in police facilities receive free medical </p><p>care. </p><p> </p><p>UAE Code of Criminal Procedures Arts. 14 and 22 </p><p>provide for legal assistance for victims. </p><p> </p><p>The following victim protection and assistance </p><p>services in Dubai Emirate are particularly notable </p><p>because almost all women traveling to the UAE for </p><p>purposes of prostitution, whether forced or otherwise, </p><p>reportedly travel to Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>Each Dubai police station is staffed with a human </p><p>rights officer and a social worker/counselor from </p><p>Dubai Police\'s Human Rights Department.  These </p><p>officers and social workers/counselors are available </p><p>to assist complainants and victims. </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, the Dubai Police Human Rights Department </p><p>developed a Crime Victims\' Assistance Program, which </p><p>includes the creation of Victim Assistance </p><p>Coordinators and police training in victim protection </p><p>and assistance.  In March 2003, Victim Assistance </p><p>Coordinators were assigned to police stations.  Victim </p><p>Assistance Coordinators\' responsibilities include </p><p>advising victims about the criminal justice system and </p><p>criminal procedure; encouraging witness testimony, </p><p>especially in cases like sexual abuse and trafficking </p><p>in persons where victims are reluctant to speak out; </p><p>advising victims of their rights; providing counseling </p><p>and medical care; placement in a safehouse or shelter; </p><p>and follow-up with victims as the case proceeds to </p><p>trial. </p><p> </p><p>The Dubai Tourist Security Department operates a 24- </p><p>hour toll-free hotline telephone number to assist </p><p>visitors with inquiries or problems.  The Department </p><p>publishes information on the hotline and precautionary </p><p>measures for visitors in a brochure that is </p><p>distributed at ports of entry and other locations. </p><p> </p><p>The Women\'s Da\'waa Administration in the Dubai </p><p>Department of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs also operates </p><p>a hotline especially geared for women and children. </p><p>Operating since July 2002, the hotline is open to all </p><p>nationalities living in all emirates.  The hotline is </p><p>open from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., Saturday to </p><p>Wednesday, but will take emergency calls on Thursday </p><p>and Friday (the UAE weekend). </p><p> </p><p>-- B.  Does the government provide funding or other </p><p>forms of support to foreign or domestic NGOs for </p><p>services to victims?  Please explain. </p><p> </p><p>The Government works with foreign NGOs to provide </p><p>assistance to trafficking victims.  We are unaware of </p><p>whether the Government provides direct financial </p><p>assistance to these NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>-- C.  Are the rights of victims respected, or are </p><p>they also treated as criminals?  Are victims detained, </p><p>jailed, or deported?  If detained or jailed, for how </p><p>long?  Are victims fined?  Are victims prosecuted for </p><p>violations of other laws, such as those governing </p><p>immigration or prostitution? </p><p> </p><p>Rights of victims are generally respected. </p><p>Individuals identified as victims are not detained, </p><p>jailed or deported.  Individuals identified as </p><p>victims are also not prosecuted for violations of </p><p>other laws, such as those governing immigration or </p><p>prostitution, if commission of such offenses is </p><p>determined to have occurred beyond their control, </p><p>which would be the case for most trafficking victims. </p><p>For example, law enforcement officials state that </p><p>they would not prosecute a victim of forced </p><p>prostitution for prostitution.  And, immigration </p><p>officials indicate that victims would not be </p><p>prosecuted for immigration violations if, for </p><p>example, they overstayed in the country illegally </p><p>because a trafficker had seized their passports. </p><p> </p><p>-- D.  Does the government encourage victims to assist </p><p>in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking? </p><p>May victims file civil suits or seek legal action </p><p>against the traffickers?  Does anyone impede the </p><p>victims\' access to such legal redress?  If a victim is </p><p>a material witness in a court case against the former </p><p>employer, is the victim permitted to obtain other </p><p>employment or to leave the country?  Is there a victim </p><p>restitution program? </p><p> </p><p>Law enforcement officials report that they advise </p><p>victims of their rights and encourage witness </p><p>testimony, especially in cases like sexual abuse and </p><p>trafficking in persons where victims are reluctant to </p><p>speak out. </p><p> </p><p>Before or during a criminal trial, a victim may claim </p><p>financial compensation or "diya", which is granted as </p><p>part of defendant\'s sentence.  Victims may also file </p><p>civil suits for damages. </p><p> </p><p>Foreign diplomats indicate that victims have been </p><p>permitted to give sworn testimony and leave the </p><p>country before judgment was rendered. </p><p> </p><p>-- E.  What kind of protections is the government able </p><p>to provide for victims and witnesses?  Does it provide </p><p>these protections in practice? </p><p> </p><p>The government is able to provide protections for </p><p>victims and witnesses. </p><p> </p><p>UAE Code of Criminal Procedures Arts. 14 and 22 </p><p>provide for legal assistance for victims. </p><p> </p><p>Authorities have worked with embassies and NGOs to </p><p>provide shelter facilities.  Victims may also seek </p><p>shelter from their embassies.  Police Departments </p><p>also reportedly provide shelter facilities for </p><p>victims separate and apart from jail facilities. </p><p> </p><p>-- F.  Does the government provide any specialized </p><p>training for government officials in recognizing </p><p>trafficking and in the provision of assistance to </p><p>trafficked victims, including the special needs of </p><p>trafficked children?  Does the government provide </p><p>training on protections and assistance to its </p><p>embassies and consulates in foreign countries that are </p><p>destination or transit countries?  Does it urge those </p><p>embassies and consulates to develop ongoing </p><p>relationships with NGOs that serve trafficked victims? </p><p> </p><p>The UAEG senior leadership has repeatedly requested </p><p>information on training opportunities that </p><p>specifically address combating trafficking in </p><p>persons, to help law enforcement officials, </p><p>prosecutors and judges better identify, investigate </p><p>and prosecute trafficking in persons cases.  After </p><p>receiving information on USG training opportunities </p><p>in February 2003, Post presented the information to </p><p>the Office of the Minister of State for Foreign </p><p>Affairs, which forwarded the information to the </p><p>Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Justice for </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Justice officials report that the </p><p>Ministry\'s Institute of Judicial Training and Studies </p><p>conducts mandatory classes for prosecutors and judges </p><p>on proper victim care and assistance.  The Institute </p><p>also conducts mandatory specialized classes (with </p><p>course duration in parentheses) on the following </p><p>topics:  human rights (14 hours); sexual offenses (20 </p><p>hours); offenses against life (20 hours); immigration </p><p>offenses (20 hours); juvenile protection and </p><p>delinquency (30 hours); labor violations and offenses </p><p>(12 hours). </p><p> </p><p>In March 2003, the Dubai Police Human Rights </p><p>Department began conducting Victim Protection and </p><p>Assistance training courses for Dubai police officers </p><p>as part of the new Dubai Police Department\'s Victims\' </p><p>Assistance Program. </p><p> </p><p>-- G.  Does the government provide assistance, such as </p><p>medical aid, shelter, or financial help, to its </p><p>repatriated nationals who are victims of trafficking? </p><p> </p><p>We are not aware of any instances in which UAE </p><p>nationals were trafficked.  Considering the UAEG\'s </p><p>record of numerous services provided to citizens at </p><p>little to no cost, it is expected that the UAEG would </p><p>provide generous assistance to repatriated UAE </p><p>nationals who are victims of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>-- H.  Which NGOs, if any, work with trafficking </p><p>victims?  What type of services do they provide?  What </p><p>sort of cooperation do they receive from local </p><p>authorities? </p><p> </p><p>The Government cooperates and coordinates with NGOs </p><p>in providing assistance to trafficking victims.  For </p><p>example, Abu Dhabi police officials have worked with </p><p>the Pakistan-based Ansar Burney Foundation, a non- </p><p>governmental organization dedicated to improving </p><p>human rights in South Asia, in providing shelter to </p><p>and assisting in the repatriation of rescued children </p><p>brought to the UAE to work as camel jockeys. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
