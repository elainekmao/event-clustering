<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000486 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/21/2004 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CSCE STAFFERS PRESS GOT ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, FREE </p><p>SPEECH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 8881 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 6116 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: In discussions on religious freedom, free </p><p>speech, and other human rights issues with GOT officials, </p><p>human rights activists, and religious groups in Ankara, two </p><p>Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) </p><p>staffers praised recent GOT reforms and urged continued </p><p>progress.  They recommended the GOT: lift obstacles </p><p>preventing non-Muslim groups from owning and renting </p><p>property; consider allowing the Halki Seminary to re-open; </p><p>re-evaluate the ban on headscarves in universities; remove </p><p>remaining restrictions on non-violent speech; and expand the </p><p>right to broadcast in non-Turkish languages.  GOT officials </p><p>said they have to proceed cautiously on reforms to avoid </p><p>instability.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Chadwick R. Gore, CSCE Staff Advisor, and H. Knox </p><p>Thames, CSCE Staff Member, traveled to Ankara January 12-16, </p><p>before heading for Diyarbakir and Istanbul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Restrictions on Non-Muslims </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Thames handed various GOT officials a two-page list of </p><p>churches closed by the State in recent years, and a copy of </p><p>an August 2001 Ministry of Interior circular advising </p><p>provincial governors not to allow Protestant churches to rent </p><p>property.  Thames said the circular had led to the closing of </p><p>a Protestant church in Iskenderun.  Turkish law has </p><p>traditionally prohibited non-Muslim groups from owning </p><p>property (note: the impact of recent reforms remains unclear. </p><p> End Note.); if these groups are not allowed to rent </p><p>property, then they are effectively prevented from practicing </p><p>their faith.  Nezih Dogan, Interior Ministry Secretary </p><p>General, said he is not aware of the circular, but denied </p><p>that the GOT discriminates against any religions.  He noted </p><p>that the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, and </p><p>said some churches may have been closed for violating zoning </p><p>laws or failing to obtain approval for buildings.  Burhan </p><p>Kuzu, chairman of the parliamentary Constitutional Committee, </p><p>argued that because Turkey has long been plagued by terrorism </p><p>the GOT has to closely monitor which organizations are </p><p>renting properties, and for what purpose.  He said the GOT is </p><p>concerned about "intensive efforts" by certain organizations </p><p>to rent property, and has doubts about the supposed religious </p><p>purposes of some properties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Joseph McClintock and Ihsan Ozbek, of the Alliance of </p><p>Protestant Churches of Turkey, said the GOT makes it </p><p>difficult for Christian groups to operate.  They said GOT </p><p>officials recently conducted background checks on the five </p><p>owners of the Alliance\'s "Radio Shema" station and determined </p><p>that none could be authorized to own a station.  The </p><p>officials told Alliance members to either find new owners or </p><p>shut down. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Thames asked Nurettin Yardimci, Director General of </p><p>Foundations, whether recent reforms allowing non-Muslim </p><p>foundations to own property (Reftels) will apply to groups </p><p>other than those traditionally considered to be recognized in </p><p>the 1923 Lausanne Treaty (Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, </p><p>and Jews).  Yardimci initially said the new law would apply </p><p>to all groups without restrictions; however, after consulting </p><p>with a legal advisor, he said the details will be spelled out </p><p>in the implementing regulations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Halki Seminary </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Thames asked Mehmet Elkatmis, chairman of the </p><p>parliamentary Human Rights Committee, whether the new GOT </p><p>could reach an agreement on re-opening the Halki Seminary, </p><p>closed since 1971 when the State nationalized most private </p><p>institutions of higher learning.  The Ecumenical Patriarchate </p><p>in Istanbul has consistently sought permission to reopen. </p><p>Elkatmis said he does not expect any progress on Halki in the </p><p>immediate future.  He said any solution on Halki will have to </p><p>include an agreement with Greece on eastern Thrace, where, he </p><p>said, Athens refuses to allow religious freedom for the </p><p>Turkish Muslim minority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Headscarf Ban </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Kemal Guruz, president of the Higher Education Council </p><p>(YOK), the institution that, among other things, enforces the </p><p>ban against wearing Islamic headcovering in universities, </p><p>said the Turkish state rests on a foundation of secularism, </p><p>which YOK is obliged to help preserve.  Guruz said the Koran </p><p>has two parts: the first deals with broad issues of morality, </p><p>much like the Bible, while the second contains religious laws </p><p>designed to regulate every aspect of one\'s life.  In Turkey, </p><p>this Koranic "religious law" has been replaced with "positive </p><p>law," meaning law that has been "filtered though human </p><p>intellect."  This is what distinguishes Turkey from "mullah </p><p>regimes" like Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Those students who want </p><p>to wear headscarves on campus pose a direct threat to the </p><p>State.  If YOK were to allow headscarves, it would </p><p>effectively be telling university students they could choose </p><p>between religious law and positive law, which is </p><p>unacceptable.  Thames said YOK might be creating a vicious </p><p>cycle; by refusing to accept headscarved students YOK is </p><p>failing to engage the minds of a significant portion of </p><p>Turkish society.  Guruz disagreed, noting that women comprise </p><p>about 45 percent of university students despite the ban. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Freedom of Speech </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Gore praised recent freedom-of-speech-related GOT </p><p>reforms (reftels), and suggested the GOT offer an amnesty for </p><p>prisoners currently jailed for speech crimes.  He suggested </p><p>the GOT should further loosen speech restrictions, with the </p><p>goal of protecting all expression not linked to violence. </p><p>Elkatmis said there is no broad support for an amnesty, and </p><p>argued that the focus should be on the future.  Kuzu said the </p><p>GOT has to proceed cautiously on speech reform.  He said </p><p>public commentary in Turkey frequently goes beyond criticism, </p><p>providing rhetorical support for terrorism.  The press is a </p><p>powerful institution whose freedom should not be unlimited. </p><p>Kaan Esener, head of the MFA\'s Council of Europe Affairs </p><p>Department, said outside observers often believe defendants </p><p>in Turkish court cases are being persecuted for speech, when </p><p>in fact they are charged with aiding terrorists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Zakir Avsar, vice president of the High Board of Radio </p><p>and Television (RTUK), said the recent legal amendments </p><p>lifting the ban against broadcasting in certain non-Turkish </p><p>languages do not permit private broadcasting in those </p><p>languages.  Under the amendments, TRT, the state radio and </p><p>television company, will decide which non-Turkish languages </p><p>should be used in which areas, and will provide appropriate </p><p>programming.  Gore argued that this is unlikely to satisfy </p><p>Turkey\'s linguistic minorities, as their communities will </p><p>have no input into the programming content.  He said outside </p><p>observers consider this a major reform, but will be </p><p>disappointed when they discover how narrowly it is being </p><p>implemented.  Avsar said the TRT programming is a first step; </p><p>in order to further loosen restrictions on non-Turkish </p><p>broadcasting the GOT will have to amend various laws and </p><p>regulations and train broadcasters in the limits of free </p><p>expression. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Gore and Thames did not have the opportunity to clear </p><p>this message. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
