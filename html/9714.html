<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 001304 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, DRL/IRF(BARNES) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KIRF, CE, Religious Freedom </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRF report:  Draft 2003 Sri Lanka submission </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) State 194330 </p><p>-      (B) Colombo-IRF 05/23/03 class email </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- </p><p>Please handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Per the request in Ref A, Mission submits the </p><p>draft 2003 International Religious Freedom report for </p><p>Sri Lanka.  As also requested in Ref A, a Word document </p><p>with tracked changes based on the 2002 report has </p><p>already been forwarded to the Department (see Ref B). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The draft 2003 Sri Lankan IRF report follows: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p>The constitution accords Buddhism the ``foremost </p><p>place,\'\' but it is not recognized as the state religion. </p><p>The constitution also provides for the right of members </p><p>of other faiths to practice their religion freely, and </p><p>the government generally respects this right in </p><p>practice. </p><p> </p><p>There was no change in the status of respect for </p><p>religious freedom during the period covered by this </p><p>report.  Despite generally amicable relations among </p><p>persons of different faiths, there has been occasional </p><p>resistance by Buddhists to Christian church activity, </p><p>and in particular to the activities of evangelical </p><p>Christian denominations.  While the courts generally </p><p>have upheld the right of evangelical Christian groups to </p><p>worship and to construct facilities to house their </p><p>congregations, the State limits the number of foreign </p><p>religious workers granted temporary residence permits. </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government discusses religious freedom issues </p><p>with the government in the context of its overall </p><p>dialogue and policy of promoting human rights. </p><p> </p><p>SECTION I. RELIGIOUS DEMOGRAPHY </p><p> </p><p>The country has a total area of 25,322 square miles and </p><p>a population of approximately 18.5 million.  Buddhism, </p><p>Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity all are practiced in </p><p>the country.  Approximately 70 percent of the population </p><p>are Buddhist, 15 percent are Hindu, 7 percent are </p><p>Muslim, and 8 percent are Christian.  There also are </p><p>small numbers of Baha\'is.  Christians tend to be </p><p>concentrated in the west, with much of the north almost </p><p>exclusively Hindu.  The other parts of the country have </p><p>a mixture of religions, with Buddhism overwhelmingly </p><p>present in the south. </p><p> </p><p>Most members of the majority Sinhalese community are </p><p>Theravada Buddhists.  Almost all Muslims are Sunnis, </p><p>with a small minority of Shi\'a, including members of the </p><p>Borah community.  Roman Catholics account for almost 90 </p><p>percent of the Christians, with Anglicans and other </p><p>mainstream Protestant churches also present in the </p><p>cities.  The Seventh-Day Adventists, Jehovah\'s </p><p>Witnesses, and the Assemblies of God are present as </p><p>well.  Evangelical Christian groups have increased in </p><p>membership in recent years, although the overall number </p><p>of members in these groups still is small. </p><p> </p><p>SECTION II. STATUS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p> </p><p>- Legal/Policy Framework </p><p> </p><p>The constitution gives Buddhism a ``foremost position,\'\' </p><p>but it also provides for the right of members of other </p><p>faiths to practice their religions freely, and the </p><p>government generally respects this right in practice. </p><p> </p><p>There are separate ministries in the government, led by </p><p>different ministers, that address religious affairs. </p><p>These include:  the Ministry of Buddha Sasana </p><p>("clergy"); the Ministry of Muslim Religious Affairs; </p><p>the Ministry of Hindu Affairs; and the Ministry of </p><p>Christian Affairs.  Each of these ministries has been </p><p>empowered to deal with issues involving the religion in </p><p>question.  Government assistance includes support for </p><p>the upkeep of religious properties and support for </p><p>festivals.  Some Christian denominations acting in Sri </p><p>Lanka have resisted greater government involvement in </p><p>their affairs; instead they are registered individually </p><p>through acts of Parliament or as corporations under </p><p>domestic law.  Christian denominations must fill out and </p><p>submit forms in order to be recognized as corporations. </p><p>This gives them legal standing in Sri Lanka to be </p><p>treated as corporate entities in their financial and </p><p>real estate transactions. </p><p>Despite the constitutional preference for Buddhism, </p><p>major religious festivals of all faiths are celebrated </p><p>as national holidays. </p><p> </p><p>The government has established councils for interfaith </p><p>understanding. </p><p> </p><p>There is no tax exemption for religious organizations as </p><p>such.  However, churches and temples are allowed to </p><p>register as charitable organizations and therefore are </p><p>entitled to some tax relief. </p><p> </p><p>- Restrictions on Religious Freedom </p><p> </p><p>Foreign clergy may work in the country, but for the last </p><p>three decades, the government has taken steps to limit </p><p>the number of foreign Christian religious workers given </p><p>temporary work permits.  Permission usually is </p><p>restricted to denominations that are registered formally </p><p>with the government.  Most religious workers in the </p><p>country, including most Christian clergy, are Sri Lankan </p><p>in origin. </p><p> </p><p>Some evangelical Christians, who constitute less than 1 </p><p>percent of the population, have expressed concern that </p><p>their efforts at proselytizing often are met with </p><p>hostility and harassment by the local Buddhist clergy </p><p>and others opposed to their work.  They sometimes </p><p>complain that the government tacitly condones such </p><p>harassment.  There is no evidence to support this claim, </p><p>however.  The Assemblies of God claims that it continues </p><p>to face opposition at the local level in many areas but </p><p>states that legal action or the threat of legal action </p><p>generally has resulted in the church being allowed to </p><p>construct facilities for its congregations and conduct </p><p>worship services. </p><p> </p><p>Religion is a mandatory subject in the school </p><p>curriculum.  Parents and children may choose whether a </p><p>child studies Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, or </p><p>Christianity.  Students of minority religions other than </p><p>Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity must pursue religious </p><p>instruction outside of the public school system.  There </p><p>are no separate syllabus provided for smaller religions, </p><p>such as the Baha\'i faith.  Religion is taught in schools </p><p>from an academic point of view. </p><p> </p><p>Issues related to family law, including divorce, child </p><p>custody, and inheritance are adjudicated by the </p><p>customary law of each ethnic or religious group.  In </p><p>1995 the government raised the minimum age of marriage </p><p>for women from 12 to 18 years, except in the case of </p><p>Muslims, who continue to follow their customary </p><p>religious practices.  The application of different legal </p><p>practices based on membership in a religious or ethnic </p><p>group may result in discrimination against women. </p><p> </p><p>From 1983 to 2001, the government (controlled by the </p><p>Sinhalese, and predominantly Buddhist, majority) fought </p><p>the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), an </p><p>insurgent organization fighting for a separate state for </p><p>the country\'s Tamil (and predominantly Hindu) minority. </p><p>In 2001, a ceasefire between the government and the LTTE </p><p>went into effect and the two parties began a process to </p><p>bring peace to the country.  Religion did not play a </p><p>significant role in the conflict, which essentially is </p><p>rooted in linguistic, ethnic, and political differences. </p><p>Buddhists, Hindus, and Christians all have been affected </p><p>by the conflict, which has claimed more than 60,000 </p><p>lives.  The military had issued warnings through public </p><p>radio before commencing major operations, instructing </p><p>civilians to congregate at safe zones around churches </p><p>and temples; however, in the conflict areas in the </p><p>north, the government occasionally has been accused of </p><p>bombing and shelling Hindu temples and Christian </p><p>churches.  In March 1999, government forces recaptured </p><p>from the LTTE the town of Madhu in the northwestern area </p><p>of the country, the site of a famous Catholic shrine. </p><p>Because Madhu was controlled by the LTTE, for several </p><p>years Catholics from the south had not been able to make </p><p>the pilgrimage to Madhu.  After the town was recaptured </p><p>by government forces, Catholics were able to resume the </p><p>pilgrimage.  In November 1999, the LTTE recaptured the </p><p>area where the shrine is located and limited access for </p><p>a period thereafter.  However, during the period covered </p><p>by this report, the LTTE generally allowed Catholics </p><p>access to the shrine.  Additionally, during the period </p><p>covered by this report, some Buddhist clergy and </p><p>faithful were allowed to visit Buddhist shrines in LTTE- </p><p>held areas for the first time in years.  The World Hindu </p><p>Congress also met in Colombo in May 2003, and was </p><p>addressed by the prime minister. </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of religious prisoners or </p><p>detainees. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE targeted Buddhist sites, most notably the </p><p>historic Dalada Maligawa or ``Temple of the Tooth,\'\' the </p><p>holiest Buddhist shrine in the country, in the town of </p><p>Kandy in January 1998.  Thirteen worshipers, including </p><p>several children, were killed by the bombing.  The </p><p>government still is attempting to locate and arrest the </p><p>LTTE perpetrators of the attack.  As a result, the </p><p>government has augmented security at a number of </p><p>religious sites island-wide, including the Temple of the </p><p>Tooth.  In contrast to previous years, the LTTE did not </p><p>target Buddhist sites during the period covered by this </p><p>report; however, the LTTE has not indicated that it will </p><p>abstain from attacking such targets in the future. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE has discriminated against Muslims, and in 1990 </p><p>expelled some 46,000 Muslim inhabitants -- virtually the </p><p>entire Muslim population -- from their homes in 540 </p><p>areas under LTTE control in the northern part of the </p><p>island.  Most of these persons remain displaced and live </p><p>in or near welfare centers.  Although some Muslims </p><p>returned to Jaffna in 1997, they did not remain there </p><p>due to the continuing threat posed by the LTTE.  There </p><p>are credible reports that the LTTE has warned thousands </p><p>of Muslims displaced from the Mannar area not to return </p><p>to their homes until the conflict is over.  Despite the </p><p>ceasefire and peace process, the LTTE continues to </p><p>extort money from Muslim families and businesses in </p><p>eastern Sri Lanka.  However, it appears that these </p><p>attacks by the LTTE are not targeted against persons due </p><p>to their religious beliefs, but that they are rather a </p><p>part of an overall strategy to clear the north and east </p><p>of persons not sympathetic to the cause of an </p><p>independent Tamil state. </p><p> </p><p>The LTTE has been accused in the past of using church </p><p>and temple compounds, which civilians are instructed by </p><p>the government to congregate in the event of </p><p>hostilities, as shields for the storage of munitions. </p><p> </p><p>- Forced Religious Conversion </p><p> </p><p>There were no reports of forced religious conversion, </p><p>including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted </p><p>or illegally removed from the United States, or of the </p><p>government\'s refusal to allow such citizens to be </p><p>returned to the United States. </p><p> </p><p>SECTION III. SOCIETAL ATTITUDES </p><p>Discrimination based on religious differences is much </p><p>less common than discrimination based on ethnic group or </p><p>caste.  In general, the members of the various faiths </p><p>tend to be tolerant of each other\'s religious beliefs. </p><p>On occasion, however, evangelical Christians have been </p><p>harassed by Buddhist monks for their attempts to convert </p><p>Buddhists to Christianity, and they at times complain </p><p>that the government tacitly condones such harassment, </p><p>although there is no evidence to support this claim (see </p><p>Section I). </p><p> </p><p>There are reports that members of various religious </p><p>groups give preference in hiring in the private sector </p><p>to members of their own group or denomination.  This </p><p>practice likely is linked to the country\'s ongoing </p><p>ethnic problems and does not appear to be based </p><p>principally on religion.  There is no indication of </p><p>preference in employment in the public sector on the </p><p>basis of religion. </p><p> </p><p>In April 2001, three Sinhalese men attacked a Muslim </p><p>cashier.  The Muslim community in Mawanella protested </p><p>police inaction during and the day after the attack.  In </p><p>response approximately 2,000 Sinhalese, including </p><p>Buddhist monks, rioted in the Muslim section of town and </p><p>confronted the Muslim protesters.  Two Muslims were </p><p>killed, and a number of buildings and vehicles were </p><p>destroyed.  The Muslim community throughout the western </p><p>portion of the country staged a number of protests </p><p>claiming the police did nothing to prevent the riot. </p><p>Some of the protests resulted in direct clashes between </p><p>the Muslim and Sinhalese communities. </p><p> </p><p>In mid-February 1999, a group of religious leaders from </p><p>the Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, and Christian communities </p><p>made a visit to the north central part of the country, </p><p>an LTTE controlled area.  The purpose of the visit was </p><p>to assess the humanitarian situation and to talk with </p><p>senior LTTE leaders.  The group later met with the </p><p>president, but there were few concrete results.  Follow- </p><p>up meetings with the LTTE were cancelled after </p><p>government forces captured additional LTTE-held </p><p>territory that year.  Since 1999 independent clergy have </p><p>maintained intermittent contact with the LTTE. </p><p>Religious leaders have continued to serve as unofficial </p><p>envoys between the two warring sides. </p><p> </p><p>SECTION IV. U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY </p><p>The U.S. Embassy discusses religious freedom issues with </p><p>the government in the context of its overall dialog and </p><p>policy of promoting human rights.  Representatives of </p><p>the Embassy regularly meet with representatives of all </p><p>of the country\'s religious groups to review a wide range </p><p>of human rights, ethnic, and religious freedom issues. </p><p>The U.S. Ambassador has met with many religious figures, </p><p>both in Colombo and in his travels around the country. </p><p>Christian bishops and prominent Buddhist monks, as well </p><p>as prominent members of the Hindu and Muslim </p><p>communities, are in regular contact with the Embassy. </p><p>The Embassy has been supportive of efforts by inter- </p><p>faith religious leaders to promote a peaceful resolution </p><p>of the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Mission confirms the statement in Section II </p><p>of the above draft that there are no reports of </p><p>religious prisoners or detainees. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
