Interpol has issued five more warrants for Maoists, </p><p>bringing the total to sixteen.  The Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) and the Maoists still have not agreed on a date for </p><p>peace talks, but the GON announced a plan aimed at </p><p>rehabilitating Maoists.  The insurgency, meanwhile, has </p><p>created a demand for passports from people trying to escape </p><p>the violence, overwhelming administrative offices and </p><p>leaving some unable to fulfill requests.  Maoists continue </p><p>to destroy infrastructure and kill innocent civilians.  Six </p><p>security personnel were killed and twenty injured after </p><p>being ambushed by Maoists.  Maoists also killed the vice- </p><p>president of a school, a Nepali Congress worker, and a man </p><p>they accused of being an informant for security forces. A </p><p>civilian was killed when he was caught in the crossfire </p><p>between Maoists and security personnel.  One hundred and </p><p>forty students kidnapped from one district by Maoists were </p><p>released, but over 100 remain in captivity.  Maoist activity </p><p>has forced the shutdown of many small businesses.   The GON </p><p>announced that nine people in custody under suspicion of </p><p>being Maoists were released. </p><p> </p><p>INTERPOL ADDS MORE MAOISTS TO WARRANT LIST </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Interpol issued Red Corner Notices against five </p><p>additional Maoist leaders on charges of terrorism, armed </p><p>robbery and murder.  The list, now totaling sixteen, already </p><p>includes the top two Maoist leaders, Prachanda and Dr. Babu </p><p>Ram Bhattarai. </p><p> </p><p>NO SIGN OF PEACE TALKS; GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES REHAB PLAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Narayan Singh Pun, Minister for Physical Planning and </p><p>Works, said the Government of Nepal (GON) has devised a plan </p><p>to rehabilitate Maoists and turn them into "responsible </p><p>citizens."  Pun said the Disarm, Demobilize, Rehabilitate </p><p>and Reintegrate (DDRR) program was finalized by the GON and </p><p>is awaiting cabinet approval.  The DDRR program is designed </p><p>to show Maoists that there are alternatives to war and </p><p>violence, and assist in rehabilitation and reintegration </p><p>into society.  Training and employment opportunities would </p><p>also be made available. Pun said participants would remain </p><p>in the training camps for six to eight months.  The program </p><p>will be launched in the mid-western development districts, </p><p>which are the most heavily affected by Maoists. The GON </p><p>hopes the program, scheduled to start January 15, will help </p><p>end the insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST CAMPAIGN CAUSING INCREASE IN PASSPORT REQUESTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Maoist insurgency has created a flood of people </p><p>requesting passports in order to escape the violence. </p><p>District Administrative Offices (DAO) in Palpa, Gulmi and </p><p>Arghakhanchi have depleted supplies of passport books, and </p><p>are currently unable to process any further applications </p><p>until more books are dispatched by the Ministry.  Netra </p><p>Prasad Sharma, Chief District Officer (CDO) of Gulmi, said </p><p>that young people are leaving to escape the "one-house one- </p><p>person " conscription campaign carried out by the Maoists, </p><p>in which every household is forced to contribute at least </p><p>one youth to join the insurgents.  Other villagers are </p><p>leaving out of fear for their safety.  Maoists control the </p><p>western part of Gulmi, while parts of Palpa, Syangja, </p><p>western Tanauhu and Nawalparasi Districts also have been </p><p>overrun by the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Abandoned headquarters in Dolakha District also have </p><p>caused public administration to come to a standstill.  The </p><p>Chief District Officer (CDO) and assistant CDO have left the </p><p>headquarters for other posts, leaving local residents unable </p><p>to obtain citizenship papers, passports and other necessary </p><p>documents.  The Ministry of Home Affairs has been unable to </p><p>send any replacement officers due to security concerns. </p><p> </p><p>INSURGENCY CRIPPLING VDC INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Village Development Committee (VDC) buildings have been </p><p>hit hard by the Maoist insurgency.  According to the VDC </p><p>National Council, 1369 out of a total 3915 VDC offices have </p><p>been destroyed by Maoist attacks since the Maoists began </p><p>their "People\'s War" in 1996.  VDC personnel have also been </p><p>targets of the Maoists.  Thirty-three VDC representatives </p><p>have been killed, thirty-two have been abducted, and </p><p>fourteen have been assaulted. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST CONTINUE TO MURDER </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  On January 3 Maoists ambushed and killed three members </p><p>of the Armed Police Force (APF) and three members of the </p><p>Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) in Banke District.  Over twenty </p><p>security personnel were also injured in the fighting. </p><p>Maoists abducted and later killed the vice-president of a </p><p>secondary school from Taplejung District on January 6.  In </p><p>Pyuthan District, Maoists shot and killed a man they said </p><p>was an informant for security forces.  A civilian was killed </p><p>in Udayapur District when he was caught in the crossfire </p><p>between Maoists and security forces.  On January 9 a group </p><p>of armed Maoists shot and killed a Nepali Congress activist </p><p>in Rautahat District, after dragging him from his home. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS KIDNAP STUDENTS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Students across Nepal are fleeing Maoist-infested areas </p><p>to avoid being kidnapped or forcibly recruited by the </p><p>Maoists.  According to reports from Dipayal District, the </p><p>absence of students has resulted in over a dozen schools </p><p>being closed.  Children have fled their schools and homes to </p><p>avoid the Maoists, who have threatened torture for those who </p><p>defy their orders.  Police said over two dozen students are </p><p>currently staying in hotels to escape forced recruitment. </p><p> </p><p>9.  According to newspaper reports, 140 students kidnapped </p><p>by Maoists in western Doti District were released after a </p><p>short period of captivity, but more than 100 remain in the </p><p>custody of the insurgents.  The kidnappings in Doti mirror </p><p>similar abductions of children in surrounding western </p><p>districts.  These reports, if verified, indicate that the </p><p>number of students kidnapped is much higher than previous </p><p>accounts (reftel).  The children were released on the </p><p>condition that they be readily available to join the Maoists </p><p>when needed.  Most of the released children have reportedly </p><p>fled to district headquarters and India to avoid </p><p>conscription. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS DESTROY BUILDINGS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Maoists destroyed a Village Development Committee </p><p>office in Kavre District on January 3.  The insurgents </p><p>seized the office and set fire to all the documents and </p><p>furniture.  On January 3 the Maoists also set off a pressure </p><p>cooker bomb at a Lalitpur District ward office, causing </p><p>severe damage to the building. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS IMPOSE CURFEWS, SHUT DOWN BUSINESSES </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  Maoists have banned the manufacturing and sale of </p><p>alcohol in Salyan District.  According to locals, the Maoist </p><p>Women\'s Organization has warned of severe consequences for </p><p>those who possess or purchase alcohol.  Many villagers in </p><p>the Salyan District depend on the sale of alcohol for their </p><p>livelihood.  Because of the ban, most have had to find other </p><p>means of income. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Maoist rebels have imposed a curfew on villagers in the </p><p>Makwanpur District.  Residents are prohibited outside after </p><p>7:00 pm.  According to villagers, the Maoists also plant </p><p>landmines to prevent security personnel from entering the </p><p>area. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The Maoist insurgency has caused many small businesses </p><p>in Sunsari District to close.  Over half the businesses, </p><p>ranging from tourism and agriculture to energy, have closed </p><p>their offices, citing a lack of security and stability in </p><p>the region as one of the causes.  Small business owners fear </p><p>that if peace is not restored, industry will continue to </p><p>decline. </p><p> </p><p>ACCUSED MAOISTS RELEASED FROM JAIL </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  In Siraha District nine people, jailed after the </p><p>declared state of emergency on charges of being Maoists, </p><p>were released on January 6 after thirteen months in jail. </p><p>Among those released was Dev Kumar Yadav, a Nepali </p><p>journalist who, at the time the state of emergency was </p><p>declared, was working as a correspondent for the weekly </p><p>newspaper "Janadisha," considered to be a mouthpiece of the </p><p>Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
