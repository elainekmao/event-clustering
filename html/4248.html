<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBED, EB/ESC, EUR/SE </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, AJ, GG, KZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY-GREECE GAS INTERCONNECT ADVANCES, BUT KEY </p><p>STICKING POINT REMAINS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: OWENS (ATHENS)-DUNNIGAN (ANKARA) 11/6 TELCON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary and comment:  Turkey and Greece have reached </p><p>agreement on the text of an Intergovernmental Agreement for </p><p>the Turkey-Greece gas interconnect, which they hope to sign </p><p>by the end of November.  BOTAS and DEPA have not, however, </p><p>been able to agree on the price at which DEPA would purchase </p><p>gas under a Gas Sales Purchase Agreement (SPA).  The </p><p>underlying problem is that Turkey is currently paying </p><p>significantly more for its imported gas than is Greece.  It </p><p>appears it will not be economically viable for Turkey to </p><p>export gas to Greece until Shah Deniz gas (by far the </p><p>cheapest Turkey will import) comes on line in 2006.  BOTAS </p><p>General Manager Bildaci requested EB/CBED Ambassador Mann\'s </p><p>assistance in encouraging the Greeks to accept paying a </p><p>higher price for gas from Turkey in the short-term for the </p><p>long-term strategic benefits this deal would bring.  Post </p><p>believes it would be useful for Ambassador Mann to raise this </p><p>issue with Greek officials during his visit to Athens later </p><p>this month (refcon).  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BOTAS General Manager Bildaci called econoff in </p><p>November 4 to request USG assistance on the Turkey-Greece </p><p>interconnect.  Bildaci said officials from the Greek </p><p>government and DEPA had visited Ankara October 30-November 1 </p><p>to discuss the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) and Gas </p><p>Sales Purchase Agreement (SPA) for the interconnect.  He </p><p>noted that the government-to-government IGA discussions were </p><p>successful, with the two sides reaching agreement on a final </p><p>text.  MFA and Ministry of Energy officials later confirmed </p><p>to econoff that they had agreed with the Greek delegation on </p><p>an IGA text, which they hope to sign by the end of November. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Bildaci noted, however, that the SPA negotiations had </p><p>ended in a stalemate over the price at which DEPA would </p><p>purchase gas from BOTAS.  The two sides discussed only the </p><p>first one half billion cubic meter (bcm) that Greece would </p><p>purchase in 2005-2006, before Shah Deniz gas comes on line </p><p>and the contracted volumes ramp up.  The root of the problem </p><p>appears to be the discrepancy between what BOTAS and DEPA are </p><p>paying for their imported gas -- since BOTAS is currently </p><p>paying more, it will be forced to sell to DEPA at a loss (or </p><p>DEPA will have to pay a higher price) until Shah Deniz comes </p><p>on line.  According to Bildaci, BOTAS is currently paying or </p><p>will pay the following amounts for its imported gas: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gas Contract      USD per thousand cubic meters </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Russia West 1       130 </p><p>Russia West 2       134 </p><p>Blue Stream         132 </p><p>Iran                123 </p><p>Shah Deniz           95.5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Note that the Russian gas figures reflect the discount </p><p>Bildaci successfully negotiated with Gazprom in July.  The </p><p>figures for Iranian gas do not reflect the discount Bildaci </p><p>negotiated, since that price is only good through 2005 </p><p>(Bildaci did not reveal what the discounted price was). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Bildaci said that DEPA officials told him they are </p><p>currently paying USD 119 per thousand cubic meters for </p><p>Russian gas.  Therefore, even if Bildaci sold gas to DEPA at </p><p>USD 123 per thousand cubic meters (the lowest price BOTAS is </p><p>currently paying), and charged no transit fees, DEPA would </p><p>still have to pay more than it is currently paying for its </p><p>imported gas.  Under BOTAS and DEPA\'s current price </p><p>structures, exporting gas to Greece does not become </p><p>economically viable until Shah Deniz comes on line.  Bildaci </p><p>told econoff he sees two options:  1) a DEPA-BOTAS </p><p>compromise, whereby both accept some minor losses for </p><p>strategic reasons; or 2) postponing the SPA negotiations (and </p><p>eventual delivery of gas to Greece) until June 2003, at which </p><p>point Shah Deniz will be far enough along to allow BOTAS to </p><p>negotiate based on Shah Deniz gas prices. </p><p>5. (C) Bildaci said he preferred the first option, which </p><p>would allow work on the Greece-Turkey interconnect to begin </p><p>immediately.  (Note:  BOTAS has already selected the French </p><p>firm Sofregaz to conduct the detailed engineering study for </p><p>the Turkish portion of the Shah Deniz pipeline).  He said </p><p>thought he could offer DEPA the price of USD 123 per thousand </p><p>meters with no transit fees.  Bildaci suggested that EB/CBED </p><p>Ambassador Mann could help significantly if he were to </p><p>encourage the Greeks to accept paying a higher price for a </p><p>small amount of gas for a few years (i.e. one half bcm until </p><p>2006/2007) in order to advance a strategic project that would </p><p>increase its diversity of supply. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Bildaci noted wryly that, before he negotiated a </p><p>discount with Gazprom, BOTAS was paying USD 133 per thousand </p><p>cubic meters for Russia West 1 gas, and USD 145 per thousand </p><p>cubic meters for Russia West II gas, significantly more than </p><p>what DEPA was paying for the same gas.  He commented that, </p><p>when he reported this situation to the new Minister of </p><p>Energy, there was sure to be -- and there should be -- </p><p>another investigation, which he dubbed "White Energy Scandal </p><p>II."  Bildaci said that, although he had had no role in </p><p>negotiating any of the high-priced Russian contracts, he </p><p>still feared the repercussions of this for BOTAS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment:  Post believes it would be useful for </p><p>Ambassador Mann to raise this issue with Greek officials </p><p>during his visit to Athens later this month (refcon).  One </p><p>complicating factor, of course, is BOTAS\'s Iran gas contract. </p><p> Although BOTAS likely will not be exporting Iranian gas to </p><p>Greece, it is the Iranian contract that allows Bildaci to </p><p>justify the USD 123 price he plans to offer DEPA.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
