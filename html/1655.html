(U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES A.I. JOSEPH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02295  01 OF 04  270100Z </p><p>MERANTE.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: THERE IS NO NEW INFORMATION SUGGESTING </p><p>AN IMMINENT PAPAL DEMISE, BUT THE POPE\'S HEALTH </p><p>APPEARS TO CONTINUE ITS DECLINE. POST OFFERS SOME </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USG\'S ACTIONS SURROUNDING THE </p><p>PAPAL FUNERAL AND ELECTION OF A NEW POPE.  THE USG </p><p>WOULD HAVE NINE DAYS FROM THE DEATH OF THE POPE TO </p><p>FORM AND SEND A PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATION TO THE FUNERAL </p><p>MASS IN THE VATICAN AND POSSIBLY THE POPE\'S NATIVE </p><p>POLAND. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ALTHOUGH POST HAS NO NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE </p><p>POPE\'S HEALTH THAT IMPELS THE TIMING OF THIS CABLE, </p><p>THE POPE\'S STATE OF HEALTH IS WELL-KNOWN AND THE </p><p>PROSPECT OF A PAPAL FUNERAL AND A SUBSEQUENT ELECTION </p><p>ARE ON THE NEARER RATHER THAN THE FARTHER HORIZON. </p><p>POST WISHES THE DEPARTMENT NOT TO BE SURPRISED BY </p><p>PROTOCOL URGENCIES ON SHORT NOTICE.  AFTER THE DEATH </p><p>OF A POPE, THERE IS A PERIOD OF MOURNING OF NINE DAYS </p><p>BEFORE THE FUNERAL MASS, WHICH WOULD BE ATTENDED BY </p><p>HEADS OF STATE OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES.  THE PROCESS </p><p>FOR ELECTING THE NEW POPE WILL BEGIN AFTER BURIAL. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>BACKGROUND: THE INTERREGNUM </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WHEN THE POPE DIES, THE PREFECT OF THE PAPAL </p><p>HOUSEHOLD (CURRENTLY AMERICAN BISHOP JAMES HARVEY) </p><p>INFORMS THE CARDINAL CHAMBERLAIN (CURRENTLY SPANISH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02295  01 OF 04  270100Z </p><p>CARDINAL EDUARDO MARTINEZ SOMALO), WHO MUST VERIFY THE </p><p>DEATH, ARRANGE FOR A DEATH CERTIFICATE AND INFORM THE </p><p>CARDINAL-VICAR OF ROME (CURRENTLY ITALIAN CARDINAL </p><p>CAMILLO RUINI).  THE CARDINAL-VICAR MAKES THE DEATH </p><p>PUBLIC; VATICAN RADIO THEN BROADCASTS THE NEWS.  THE </p><p>VATICAN PRESS OFFICE WOULD PROBABLY HOLD A PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE THAT DAY.  THE CARDINAL-CHAMBERLAIN THEN </p><p>LOCKS AND SEALS THE POPE\'S PRIVATE APARTMENTS.  THE </p><p>CARDINAL CHAMBERLAIN, ON BEHALF OF THE COLLEGE OF </p><p>CARDINALS ASSUMES RESPONSIBILITY "AD INTERIM" FOR </p><p>CHURCH GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE FUNERAL AND BURIAL OF </p><p>THE POPE AND THE ELECTION OF HIS SUCCESSOR. THREE </p><p>CARDINAL ASSISTANTS, SELECTED BY LOT FROM AMONG </p><p>CARDINALS ALREADY IN ROME, HELP THE CHAMBERLAIN.  THE </p><p>HEADS OF VATICAN GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS, WITH SOME </p><p>EXCEPTIONS SUCH AS THE CHAMBERLAIN HIMSELF ARE </p><p>SUSPENDED FROM EXERCISING THEIR AUTHORITY.  THE PAPAL </p><p>FUNERAL RITES CONTINUE FOR NINE CONSECUTIVE DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>TWO FUNERALS? AND AN INAUGURATION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) POST RECOMMENDS THAT THE PRESIDENT ATTEND THE </p><p>PONTIFF\'S FUNERAL SERVICES IN THE VATICAN.  IT IS VERY </p><p>POSSIBLE THAT THE POPE\'S WILL DIRECTS THAT HE BE </p><p>BURIED IN HIS NATIVE POLAND, A REQUEST THAT THE </p><p>VATICAN WOULD HONOR, WE BELIEVE.  THE WHITE HOUSE </p><p>SHOULD THUS CONSIDER THAT THERE MAY BE A NEED FOR </p><p>ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATION FOR BURIAL SERVICES IN </p><p>POLAND.  IN ADDITION, WE RECOMMEND A HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02295  01 OF 04  270100Z </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATION OF EIGHT OR NINE TO THE </p><p>INAUGURATION OF THE NEW POPE, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS </p><p>OCCURRED WITHIN THE WEEK FOLLOWING THE BURIAL. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>WHO ATTENDS THE FUNERAL </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  WITH A POPE AS ACTIVE IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS AND </p><p>WHO HAS VISITED MORE NATIONS THAN ANY OTHER PONTIFF, </p><p>THE PAPAL FUNERAL WOULD PROBABLY BE ATTENDED BY MANY </p><p>HEADS OF STATE.  JOHN PAUL II HAS MET MANY CURRENT </p><p>WORLD LEADERS PERSONALLY, AND WE EXPECT THAT MANY OF </p><p>THEM WILL COME TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS. THE NINE-DAY </p><p>NOTICE OF A PAPAL FUNERAL WILL PUT HOTEL SPACE AT A </p><p>PREMIUM.  HOTELS WILL HAVE TO TURN RESERVED GUESTS </p><p>AWAY.  HOTELS ARE REPORTED TO HAVE ALREADY AGREED WITH </p><p>SOME MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS TO TURN OUT GUESTS TO ALLOW </p><p>THE PRESS TO TAKE ROOMS.  WE RECOMMEND THAT THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0715 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  02295  02 OF 04  270101Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   ACQ-00   CA-02    CIAE-00  CPR-02   DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     M-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OCS-03   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /014W </p><p>                  ------------------E47D89  270101Z /15 </p><p>R 260927Z APR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0000 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY WARSAW </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 VATICAN 002295 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (SCOTT KILNER); EUR/EX (LYNN DENT); </p><p>S/CPR (SOTIROPOULOS) </p><p>NSC </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 61/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/25 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02295  02 OF 04  270101Z </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, KPRP, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: USG READINESS FOR PAPAL TURNOVER AND HIGH </p><p>LEVEL VISIT </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT STAY WITH THE AMBASSADOR TO THE HOLY SEE IN </p><p>THE OFFICIAL RESIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>THE CONCLAVE: PREPARATIONS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) CARDINALS WILL ARRIVE IN ROME FROM THE WORLD </p><p>OVER; THEY WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH HOTEL SPACE, AS </p><p>THEY WILL STAY IN THE DOMUS SANTA MARTA FACILITY, </p><p>INSIDE THE VATICAN AND REBUILT RECENTLY FOR THEIR USE. </p><p>PREVIOUS CONCLAVES INVOLVED THE CARDINALS STAYING IN </p><p>CRAMPED ROOMS NEAR THE SISTINE CHAPEL.  EVEN WHILE THE </p><p>FUNERAL RITES ARE GOING ON, THE CARDINALS MEET IN </p><p>"GENERAL CONGREGATIONS" ORGANIZED BY THE CHAMBERLAIN. </p><p>AT THIS TIME THE CARDINALS WOULD LIKELY BEGIN </p><p>INFORMALLY TO DISCUSS CANDIDATES FOR THE PAPACY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE CONCLAVE: VOTING </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THOSE CARDINALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE MUST </p><p>BEGIN TO DO SO NO EARLIER THAN FIFTEEN AND NO LATER </p><p>THAN TWENTY DAYS AFTER THE DEATH OF THE POPE.  NEWS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ALREADY OPTIONED CHOICE LOCATIONS </p><p>TO STAKE OUT THE VOTING. THE CONCLAVE PROPER BEGINS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02295  02 OF 04  270101Z </p><p>WITH A MORNING MASS IN ST PETER\'S BASILICA, AFTER </p><p>WHICH THE CARDINALS GO TO THE SISTINE CHAPEL, WHERE </p><p>THEY TAKE AN OATH TO FOLLOW THE ELECTION RULES </p><p>(CHANGED BY POPE JOHN PAUL II).  THEN THEY CAST THE </p><p>FIRST VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>HOW LONG IT WILL LAST </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THERE IS NO LIMIT ON HOW LONG THE VOTING MAY </p><p>GO ON, BUT IN PRACTICE, IT LIKELY WILL BE A MATTER OF </p><p>DAYS.  NONE OF THE TEN CONCLAVES SINCE 1831 LASTED </p><p>MORE THAN FOUR DAYS. WHEN A CANDIDATE RECEIVES THE </p><p>REQUISITE MAJORITY (WHICH VARIES ACCORDING TO HOW MANY </p><p>TIMES VOTES HAVE BEEN CAST), THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE </p><p>OF CARDINALS FORMALLY ASKS THE WINNER IF HE ACCEPTS </p><p>ELECTION AND BY WHAT NAME HE WISHES TO BE CALLED.  THE </p><p>CONCLAVE IS THEN OFFICIALLY OVER. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>SMOKE RISING </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ORDINARILY, THE FIRST INDICATION TO THE </p><p>OUTSIDE WORLD THAT A NEW POPE HAS BEEN ELECTED COMES </p><p>WHEN A PLUME OF WHITE SMOKE RISES FROM THE SISTINE </p><p>CHAPEL AS THE LAST BALLOTS ARE BURNT.  (FOR BALLOTS </p><p>THAT DO NOT RESULT IN THE NEEDED MAJORITY, A CHEMICAL </p><p>MIXED WITH THE BALLOTS GIVES THEM A DARK APPEARANCE </p><p>WHEN THEY ARE BURNT.)  NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WITH PRIME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02295  02 OF 04  270101Z </p><p>LOCATIONS WILL BE VIDEOTAPING SMOKE RISING FROM THE </p><p>SISTINE CHAPEL.  THESE ORGANIZATIONS WITH THEIR ROUND- </p><p>THE-CLOCK STAKEOUTS WILL FURTHER EXACERBATE THE HOTEL </p><p>ROOM SHORTAGE WE PREDICT FOR ROME.  THE MEDIA WILL </p><p>WAIT TO CAPTURE ON TAPE THE SENIOR CARDINAL DEACON </p><p>PROCLAIMING THE ELECTION ON THE MAIN BALCONY FROM ST </p><p>PETERS, OVERLOOKING THE SQUARE WHEN THE NEW POPE </p><p>APPEARS TO IMPART HIS BLESSING. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>NO CORONATION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) POPE JOHN PAUL I (WHOSE REIGN LASTED 33 DAYS) </p><p>DISCONTINUED THE ELABORATE CORONATION CEREMONY </p><p>PRESCRIBED BY HIS PREDECESSORS.  THE NEXT POPE\'S </p><p>ELECTION, LIKE THOSE OF JOHN PAUL I AND JOHN PAUL II </p><p>IN 1978, SHOULD BE COMPLETED AND CELEBRATED BY TWO </p><p>EVENTS.  FIRST, THERE WILL MOST LIKELY BE A PUBLIC </p><p>"SOLEMN CEREMONY OF INAUGURATION" OF THE NEW PAPACY. </p><p>SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE NEW POPE WOULD TAKE FORMAL </p><p>POSSESSION OF HIS PATRIARCHAL BASILICA, WHICH IS ST </p><p>JOHN LATERAN, THE "CATHEDRAL" OF ROME, IN A CEREMONY </p><p>INVOLVING A PONTIFICAL MASS THERE.  THE VATICAN WOULD </p><p>NOT EXPECT A HEAD OF STATE TO ATTEND THESE MASSES IF </p><p>S/HE ATTENDED THE FUNERAL, BUT A DELEGATION FROM THE </p><p>HEAD OF STATE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO ATTEND.  EMBASSY </p><p>VATICAN SUGGESTS A TEN-PERSON DELEGATION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0718 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  02295  03 OF 04  270102Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   ACQ-00   CA-02    CIAE-00  CPR-02   DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     M-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OCS-03   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /014W </p><p>                  ------------------E47D96  270102Z /15 </p><p>R 260927Z APR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 0000 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY WARSAW </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 VATICAN 002295 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (SCOTT KILNER); EUR/EX (LYNN DENT); </p><p>S/CPR (SOTIROPOULOS) </p><p>NSC </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 61/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/25 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02295  03 OF 04  270102Z </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, KPRP, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: USG READINESS FOR PAPAL TURNOVER AND HIGH </p><p>LEVEL VISIT </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>HOUSING FOR A PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATION </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) WE RECOMMEND THAT THE WHITE HOUSE CONSIDER </p><p>THE RESIDENCE OF THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE HOLY SEE </p><p>FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S USE DURING HIS STAY.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR\'S RESIDENCE HAS TWO EXTRA BEDROOMS, WITH </p><p>ONE OTHER ROOM USABLE AS A SLEEPING ROOM.  THE </p><p>RESIDENCE HAS A 24-HOUR GUARD AND GATED ENTRY.  THE </p><p>RESIDENCE HAS A TOTAL OF 1400 SQUARE METERS (15,246 </p><p>SQUARE FEET). </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) IF THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT STAY AT THE </p><p>RESIDENCE, WE SUGGEST HOTELS WHICH ARE CLOSE TO THE </p><p>VATICAN, DUE TO PROJECTED EXTREME TRAFFIC CONGESTION: </p><p>- CAVALIERE HILTON - 4.6 KLOMETERS FROM THE VATICAN - </p><p>312 ROOMS TOTAL.  THERE ARE 17 SUITES IN ALL, TWO OF </p><p>WHICH ARE "PRESIDENTIAL" AND ONE "ROYAL." </p><p>- HOLIDAY INN ST PETER\'S - 4.5 KM FROM THE VATICAN)- </p><p>300 ROOMS, AND 25 EXECUTIVE ROOMS. </p><p>- HOTEL MINERVA - (2.5 M FROM THE VATICAN)- WITH 118 </p><p>ROOMS AND 16 SUITES. </p><p>- HOTEL AMBASCIATORI - 4 KM FROM THE VATICAN -WITH </p><p>150 ROOMS AND 8 SUITES. </p><p>- EXCELSIOR HOTEL- 4 KM FROM THE VATICAN - WITH 318 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  02295  03 OF 04  270102Z </p><p>ROOMS AND 15 SUITES. </p><p>- ST.

(SBU) FOLLOWING MEDIA REPORTS OVER THE PAST </p><p>SEVERAL YEARS AND CULMINATING IN RECENT ARTICLES, </p><p>MAJOR NEWS ORGANIZATIONS ARE PLANNING FOR PERSON- </p><p>INTENSIVE OPERATIONS, WITH ROUND-THE-CLOCK STAKEOUTS </p><p>OF THE VATICAN.  THEY WILL NEED HUNDREDS OF HOTEL </p><p>ROOMS.  IT WILL BE CRITICAL FOR THE U.S. DELEGATION TO </p><p>MAKE HOTEL RESERVATIONS IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEARNING OF </p><p>THE POPE\'S DEATH.  IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE COMES FOR </p><p>ONE OF THE MASSES, HOTEL SPACE WILL BE EVEN MORE IN </p><p>DEMAND. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) IN ADDITION TO THE MEDIA HORDES THAT WILL </p><p>DESCEND ON ROME, MOST NATIONS WILL SEND TOP LEVEL </p><p>DELEGATIONS WITH MANY HEADS OF STATE.  DUE TO A </p><p>COMBINATION OF FACTORS, THIS POPE\'S FUNERAL MAY </p><p>ATTRACT THE LARGEST NUMBER OF OFFICIAL VISITORS FOR </p><p>ANY PAPAL FUNERAL IN HISTORY.  OVER TWENTY YEARS OF </p><p>HIGH-PROFILE INVOLVEMENT IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS, THE MOST </p><p>FOREIGN TRAVEL OF ANY POPE IN HISTORY, THE GREAT </p><p>NUMBER OF PERSONAL MEETINGS BETWEEN THIS POPE AND </p><p>EXISTING HEADS OF STATE OR GOVERNMENT - ALL THESE </p><p>ARGUE FOR THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>REPRESENTATION, ACCOMPANIED BY THE INEVITABLE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  02295  03 OF 04  270102Z </p><p>ENTOURAGES. </p><p> </p><p>16.

SINCE </p><p>THE 1979 ROUND OF FUNERAL AND ELECTION  MASSES, THE </p><p>VATICAN HAS ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH EVEN </p><p>MORE NATIONS.
