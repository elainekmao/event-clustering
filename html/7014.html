<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001951 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON WAR IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Banner headlines carried in the front pages of all </p><p>Arabic dailies today, April 1, highlight Iraq\'s </p><p>statement that 54 of the coalition forces were killed </p><p>in "fierce" battles in the south of Iraq.  Another </p><p>lead story in all papers highlight King Abdullah and </p><p>Queen Rania\'s condolence visit to the families of the </p><p>five Jordanians who fell victim to bombing by </p><p>coalition forces earlier in the war.  Majority of </p><p>commentaries in Al-Rai newspaper, in particular, seem </p><p>to defend Jordan\'s clear stand towards the Iraqi war. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Iraqi victories are real" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(04/01):  "One of the most important claims made by </p><p>the supporters of the aggression is that it is </p><p>impossible for Iraqi to achieve military or political </p><p>victory over the United States, and that all these </p><p>Iraqi sacrifices would be useless at the end of the </p><p>day when faced with the technical power of the </p><p>American invasion army.  In reality, the Iraqi </p><p>resistance managed to achieve many victories, whose </p><p>outcome may not be apparent on the military arena for </p><p>the moment, but are political achievements of the </p><p>first caliber, and thus must be focused upon.  The </p><p>first accomplishment of the Iraqi resistance is its </p><p>coming together in unity for the defense of the land </p><p>against the invasion.  The issue is no longer about </p><p>the legitimacy of the Iraqi regimes, but rather about </p><p>the fate of the Iraqi state..  This resistance and </p><p>this steadfastness has cost the Iraqis a great deal, </p><p>but has accomplished a very important outcomes, namely </p><p>showing the American invasion for what it really is: </p><p>an aggression and invasion for the purpose of </p><p>occupation and control of resources.  This resistance </p><p>also proved the falseness of the Iraqi opposition and </p><p>its lack of popular grounds on Iraqi territories.  The </p><p>resistance proved that this group that met in London </p><p>under the auspices of the CIA does not have the </p><p>capability to change anything on the ground and is </p><p>rejected by the Iraqi people even more than the regime </p><p>is rejected..  Let us also not forget the cumulative </p><p>effect of he Iraqi resistance on the Arab conscience, </p><p>which we hope will continue its awakening..  Yes, the </p><p>Iraqi people are suffering a great deal now from the </p><p>American brutality.  Yet, these few days have </p><p>destroyed many fables in the Arab world and in the </p><p>world.  Very soon, the United States is going to pay a </p><p>huge cost for its stupidity, but only if millions of </p><p>Arabs and Muslims take advantage of this massive tide </p><p>of emotions and turn it into effective action that </p><p>makes up for the sacrifices of the Iraqis.  Would the </p><p>Arabs rise to the level of this responsibility?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "Stop Jordan\'s retribution" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Samir Hiyari writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(04/01):  "Sounds like the Jordanian memory requires </p><p>continuous reminders of Jordan\'s achievements, </p><p>accomplishments and positive stances with regard to </p><p>the struggles ongoing to our west and to our east.. </p><p>We would inflicting upon ourselves great injustice </p><p>when we hold ourselves and our country in retribution </p><p>without taking into consideration the complete </p><p>reality, the royal efforts to resolve the crisis, and </p><p>the size of Jordan with its capabilities and influence </p><p>on the ground.  Some, for example, are calling for a </p><p>more honest role towards the war on Iraq, and some </p><p>simply forget that the world in 2003 is not the same </p><p>world in 1990..  There is no vagueness and no mystery </p><p>when it comes to the Jordan\'s stand.  Rejecting the </p><p>war on Iraq, feeling with the brotherly people in </p><p>Iraq, and dealing with what is going on with civility </p><p>and responsibility have marked the King\'s address to </p><p>his people.  After all, King Abdullah\'s achievements </p><p>were not focused on a personal interest.  It is the </p><p>responsibility of a Hashemite leader keen not to see a </p><p>single drop of blood shed in any Arab country." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
