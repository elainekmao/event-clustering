<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 001108 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN, INL/ENT, DRL/PHD, AND EB </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, KJUS, KCRM, SNAR, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAN SUPREME COURT RULES IT HAS AUTHORITY TO </p><p>INTERPRET CONSTITUTION; CONGRESS VOWS A FIGHT </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 TEGUCIGALPA 3349 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry L. Palmer </p><p>Reasons 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY:  On May 7, in a unanimous 15-0 decision, the </p><p>Honduran Supreme Court declared its authority to interpret </p><p>the Constitution by ruling on a controversial constitutional </p><p>amendment passed by Congress in 1999.  The Court\'s decision </p><p>struck down as unconstitutional Article 218(9) which provides </p><p>that interpretations of the Constitution by Congress are not </p><p>subject to presidential veto or presidential approval.  By </p><p>exercising its constitutional prerogative of judicial review, </p><p>the court\'s decision firmly established the body as final </p><p>arbiter to interpret the Constitution.  However, Congress has </p><p>exercised its political supremacy historically to interpret </p><p>the Constitution.  The court\'s decision has put the body </p><p>squarely on a collision course with Congress, which may act, </p><p>possibly as early as tomorrow, to thwart the court\'s ruling. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On May 7, in a unanimous 15-0 decision, the Honduran </p><p>Supreme Court declared its authority to interpret the </p><p>Constitution by ruling on a controversial constitutional </p><p>amendment passed in 1999.  The Court\'s decision struck down </p><p>as unconstitutional Article 218(9) which provides that </p><p>interpretations of the Constitution by Congress are not </p><p>subject to presidential veto or presidential approval. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) On November 13, 2002 Human Rights Commissioner Dr. </p><p>Ramon Custodio, with the support of civil society, filed a </p><p>lawsuit alleging that the Congressional amendment violated </p><p>the separation of powers provision on the Constitution and </p><p>was thus unconstitutional (reftel).  (Note:  Historically, </p><p>Congress has exercised its political supremacy to interpret </p><p>the Constitution.  End Note.)  On January 10, 2003, the </p><p>Public Ministry issued an ambiguous opinion that ultimately </p><p>concluded that the claims of the Human Rights Commissioner </p><p>were incorrect and that Article 218(9) was not </p><p>unconstitutional.  The Court\'s May 7 ruling, however, </p><p>affirmed the position of the Human Rights Commissioner, </p><p>putting the body squarely on a collision course with Congress </p><p>over which body has the ultimate authority to interpret the </p><p>Constitution. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  The issue has received significant press coverage </p><p>over the last few days as speculation mounts over what move </p><p>Congress will make next.  Many Honduran NGO\'s are mobilizing </p><p>over the issue, with most favoring the Court\'s decision and </p><p>opposing any congressional action.  Post notes that neither </p><p>President Ricardo Maduro or any other senior GOH official has </p><p>issued any statements on either the Supreme Court\'s ruling or </p><p>possible congressional action in response to the ruling. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Pepe Lobo, President of the Congress, told the </p><p>Political Section May 12 that he believed the press was </p><p>over-blowing the issue.  He confirmed that he would be </p><p>meeting with other congressional leaders later in the day to </p><p>discuss possible congressional action, but indicated he </p><p>believed that nothing "drastic" was in the works.  However, </p><p>some observers feel Congress might act to pass proposed </p><p>legislation authorizing the body to remove any sitting </p><p>government official it had confirmed, including Supreme Court </p><p>Justices, thus giving Congress the ability to manipulate </p><p>further court proceedings.  Some press articles have </p><p>speculated that Congress might act to impeach the five </p><p>members of the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador met May 12 with Custodio at Custodio\'s </p><p>request to discuss the issue.  Custodio termed the situation </p><p>"an unnecessary scandal."  He noted that of the five judges </p><p>on the constitutional chamber, three are considered to be </p><p>Nationalists and two are considered to be Liberals.  Custodio </p><p>said that Congress does not currently have the power to </p><p>remove judges merely for displeasure over a ruling.  However, </p><p>if Congress passes the proposed legislation authorizing the </p><p>body to remove any sitting government official it had </p><p>confirmed, it will have the power to do exactly that. </p><p>Custodio said he does not think that Congress will remove the </p><p>five judges.  He noted that the Supreme Court\'s ruling on </p><p>Article 218(9) in turn also invalidates Article 205(10), </p><p>which Congress passed August 8, 2002 but has yet to ratify. </p><p>Article 205(10) would explicitly grant congress the power to </p><p>interpret the Constitution through a single two-thirds </p><p>majority vote in one session (reftel).  Custodio urged the </p><p>G-15 to discreetly raise its views with Congress and the </p><p>public to make it clear that international donors were </p><p>watching the situation closely. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  COMMENT:  The Supreme Court\'s ruling marks a </p><p>watershed in Honduran jurisprudence.  By exercising its </p><p>constitutional right to interpret the Constitution, the Court </p><p>has established itself as an essential check-and-balance on </p><p>congressional excesses.  Congress, however, is unlikely to </p><p>simply accept the Court\'s ruling.  Post is wary that Congress </p><p>may act rashly and retaliate with actions that could greatly </p><p>harm the rule of law and separation of powers in Honduras. </p><p>EmbOffs are quietly raising Post\'s concerns with NGOs, the </p><p>GOH, and Congress.  Post is also pushing the G-15 to make a </p><p>joint statement supporting the Supreme Court\'s ruling and </p><p>urging the Congress not to try to overturn the ruling or take </p><p>other misguided steps.  END COMMENT </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
