<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000963 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT GOZ DEPORTS ANDREW MELDRUM; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Arrests, deportations: Government </p><p>      running scared" the independent weekly "The Standard" </p><p>      dedicated its May 18 editorial to criticizing the </p><p>      Government of Zimbabwe for deporting Andrew Meldrum, a </p><p>      United States national and Harare-based correspondent </p><p>      of the British newspaper "The Guardian," despite a High </p><p>      Court order preventing the expulsion.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Zimbabwe has once again shot itself in the foot - </p><p>      and in the full glare of international media, for that </p><p>      matter - by deliberately flouting its own laws and </p><p>      throwing caution to the wind just to allow junior </p><p>      Information Minister Jonathan Moyo and the Department </p><p>      of Immigration to settle old scores.  Who would want to </p><p>      invest in a country with a government, which can deport </p><p>      an innocent journalist in total defiance of a court </p><p>      order.?  There is no doubt that the government, and </p><p>      Moyo, were highly embarrassed after Meldrum </p><p>      successfully challenged their deportation order in the </p><p>      High Court in July last year. . .  The way the </p><p>      government. . .handled the Meldrum affair therefore </p><p>      makes a mockery of Harare\'s monotonous and tired </p><p>      complaints that Zimbabwe does not deserve the bad press </p><p>      it is attracting overseas.  What better way to attract </p><p>      a negative international image can there be than the </p><p>      primitive, amateurish, unlawful and vindictive </p><p>      deportation of an innocent journalist. . .?" </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Comment:  By any measure, the GoZ\'s behavior </p><p>      during the May 16 deportation of Andrew Meldrum was a </p><p>      travesty.  Immigration officials suspended due process, </p><p>      lied to Meldrum and his lawyer ("we don\'t intend to </p><p>      deport you"), lied to Embassy consular officials </p><p>      ("Meldrum is not at the airport"), defied 3 separate </p><p>      High Court orders prohibiting Meldrum\'s deportation, </p><p>      and denied Embassy officers consular access to Meldrum </p><p>      after he was detained and taken to the airport.  As the </p><p>      Standard\'s editorial points out, the Meldrum </p><p>      deportation seriously undermines any grounds the GoZ </p><p>      may have had to complain about unjustly negative </p><p>      publicity. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
