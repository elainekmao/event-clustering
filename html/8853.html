Turkey and </p><p>the U.S. have agreed to hold a high-level military meeting </p><p>in November, and a meeting of the Economic Partnership </p><p>Council in the Fall.  Dailies point to a statement by Phil </p><p>Reeker, in which he underlined the long-term strategic </p><p>partnership between the two countries.  Dailies also carry </p><p>Grossman\'s remarks urging the U.S. and Turkey to look to the </p><p>future following the tension over the Iraq war.  `We have a </p><p>long list of things to do together,\' Grossman said.  He also </p><p>noted that Foreign Minister Gul was welcome to visit the </p><p>U.S. anytime.  Amb. Ziyal said at a press conference in </p><p>Washington on Wednesday that FM Gul may pay an official </p><p>visit to the U.S. in the next month.  "Cumhuriyet" says that </p><p>in an effort to please the U.S., Ankara is reshaping its </p><p>Iraqi policy, normalizing ties with Armenia, and moving away </p><p>from Arafat, Iran and Syria. </p><p>EU harmonization laws: The parliamentary justice committee </p><p>approved the 6th EU harmonization package and submitted it </p><p>to the general assembly to be discussed on Thursday.  All </p><p>signs point to a swift approval procedure, with new positive </p><p>amendments on the anti-terror law and Kurdish broadcast and </p><p>education.  Justice Minister and government spokesman Cemil </p><p>Cicek said Ankara hoped to receive a date for membership </p><p>negotiations before December 2004.  The European </p><p>Commission\'s Turkey Representative, Hans-Jorg Kretschmer, </p><p>said he was pleased that the package had been forwarded to </p><p>parliament without being discussed at the National Security </p><p>Council (NSC). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anti-corruption move; $1 billion U.S. grant: The </p><p>Parliamentary Anti-Corruption Committee is expected to </p><p>decide on an investigation of former ANAP leader Mesut </p><p>Yilmaz and five other former cabinet members on charges of </p><p>irregularities and graft in energy contracts and </p><p>privatization.  Investigations could pave the way for </p><p>criminal prosecution of the former politicians.  Meanwhile, </p><p>dailies report U.S. Congressional sources as saying that the </p><p>$1 billion U.S. grant for Turkey could be delivered in four </p><p>tranches within a five-year period, depending on the </p><p>completion of the fifth review of Turkey\'s $16 billion IMF </p><p>package. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WT article blames Ambassador Pearson: Most papers carry </p><p>excerpts from a Washington times article holding U.S. </p><p>Ambassador Pearson as responsible for leaking to the press </p><p>negative information about Turkey during negotiations with </p><p>Ankara leading up to the Iraq war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>American Corners: In coordination with local chambers of </p><p>commerce, the U.S. Embassy inaugurated American Corners in </p><p>the Turkish provinces of Gaziantep, Bursa and Kayseri.  The </p><p>Corners will serve as information offices to help Turks </p><p>manage business and educational relationships with their </p><p>American counterparts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:   Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Iraq" </p><p>Cengiz Candar opined in the conservative DB Tercuman (6/19): </p><p>"Turkey should evaluate its policy about the future of this </p><p>region rather than obsessing over the rhetoric of the </p><p>Turkish-American relationship. Turkey\'s stance on the </p><p>region\'s future will be the most determining factor in </p><p>shaping its relations with the US.  Given that fact, it is </p><p>useless to stick with the line that `America does not know </p><p>what to do in Iraq, but Turkey can do a lot for the US </p><p>there.\' . Turkey better be answering the following question: </p><p>Does Turkey really know what type of Iraq it wants to see in </p><p>the post-war era?  How will Turkey try to realize its </p><p>vision?  The future of Turkish-American relations is </p><p>directly linked to these questions." </p><p>"A War after the war in Iraq" </p><p>Sami Kohen observed in mass appeal Milliyet (6/19): </p><p>"Following the end of Iraq war, it seems that the US is </p><p>seeing a new type of war in Iraq.  Recent incidents, which </p><p>appear to be growing, might signal a `war after the war\' for </p><p>the US.  This has the potential to continue for a longer </p><p>period, and might cause more US casualties than the war </p><p>itself. .The current atmosphere in Iraq - illegality, </p><p>unemployment, and poverty -- is problematic enough to drive </p><p>Iraqis mad.  The existing power vacuum is negative enough, </p><p>and anti-American sentiment among various ethnic and </p><p>religious groups is only making it worse. .Military </p><p>strategists in the Washington administration knew well how </p><p>to win the war.  Yet political strategists seem to have </p><p>failed to plan for establishing order in the post-war </p><p>period. . The US will be facing an even more serious </p><p>situation unless it manages to establish a new political and </p><p>economic order in Iraq as fast as possible." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
