<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001026 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PREF, IZ, CA, Iraq, CIDA, AID </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA: RESPONDING TO IRAQ HUMANITARIAN APPEALS, </p><p>CONSIDERING RECONSTRUCTION ROLE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 89192 B. STATE 90025 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) We delivered ref A talking points on April 7 to Norman </p><p>Macdonnell, Chief of Operations for International </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance at the Canadian International </p><p>Development Agency (CIDA). On April 8, poloff met with </p><p>Mcdonnell, Louise Marchand, CIDA\'s Director General for </p><p>International Assistance, Mario Renaud, Director General for </p><p>CIDA\'s North Africa and Middle East programs, and Daniel </p><p>Joly, Director of CIDA\'s Iraq task force, to receive a </p><p>response and to discuss CIDA\'s possible participation in Iraq </p><p>reconstruction efforts. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Macdonnell agreed that our record of Canada\'s total </p><p>contribution to the Iraq humanitarian response, approximately </p><p>U.S. $70 million, is correct. In response to the first round </p><p>of humanitarian appeals, CIDA announced on March 26 the </p><p>allocation of C$20 million (U.S. $13 million), as follows: $4 </p><p>million to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); </p><p>$4 million to UNICEF; $6.3 million to the World Food Program; </p><p>$600,000.00 to the Office for the Coordination of </p><p>Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); $3.5 million to the </p><p>International Committee of the Red Cross; $1 million to the </p><p>International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent </p><p>Societies; and $600,000.00 to CARE Canada (figures are in </p><p>Canadian dollars). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Macdonnell indicated CIDA is close to reaching a </p><p>decision on the size and allocation of the next tranche of </p><p>Canada\'s contribution, and will consider the March 28 U.N. </p><p>flash appeal and any subsequent flash appeals in making that </p><p>decision. He said CIDA Minister Susan Whelan has an open mind </p><p>about increasing the total amount of Canada\'s contribution </p><p>beyond the C$100 million committed to date. Director General </p><p>Marchand commented that countries have been very generous in </p><p>responding to appeals for Iraq humanitarian assistance, and </p><p>she didn\'t think there would be a problem in meeting future </p><p>Iraq relief appeals. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) With regard to Canadian participation in the </p><p>reconstruction of Iraq, Renaud said the preliminary thinking </p><p>is that Canada will participate, but Prime Minister Chretien </p><p>has made no official decision on the role Canada will play. </p><p>Renaud emphasized that it is Canada\'s preference to work </p><p>through the U.N. on reconstruction efforts, but added that </p><p>the U.N. and other international bodies should act as </p><p>partners with the coalition. (Note: In April 8 remarks on the </p><p>floor of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chretien stated </p><p>that Canada is in agreement with Prime Minister Blair that </p><p>the U.N. "must be closely involved in the process of </p><p>reconstructing Iraq. But I think it would be impossible for </p><p>the U.N. to do it all alone. And we are ready to help as soon </p><p>as possible." End note.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Renaud emphasized the importance of taking a </p><p>comprehensive approach to reconstruction, and cited several </p><p>specific areas where he thinks Canada could make a </p><p>contribution. With respect to the political and economic </p><p>aspects of reconstruction, Renaud mentioned the experience </p><p>Canadians have in municipal governance, central banking </p><p>systems, currency management, the development of trade </p><p>policies, and drafting constitutions. For internal security </p><p>reform, Renault suggested Canada could play a role in the </p><p>training of police forces, and in organizing correctional </p><p>services. Renault doesn\'t believe reconstruction will take a </p><p>long time, perhaps 3-5 years, and that with its oil resources </p><p>Iraq should be in the top tier of developing countries by the </p><p>end of the  reconstruction period. (Comment:  Renaud\'s </p><p>mention of specific areas in which Canada would participate </p><p>tracks with a statement made by Canadian Ambassador Kergin to </p><p>Under Secretary Grossman, at their April 4 meeting in </p><p>Washington (ref B), that the GOC wants to find some </p><p>particular contribution it can make to reconstruction. End </p><p>comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
