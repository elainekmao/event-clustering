THE </p><p>TRANSFERS OF PGRFA UNDER THE TREATY WILL BE PURSUANT TO A </p><p>STANDARD MATERIAL TRANSFER AGREEMENT (MTA), WHICH WILL IN </p><p>EFFECT BECOME THE DE FACTO GLOBAL STANDARD FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES OF PGRFA.

EIGHT COUNTRIES HAVE RATIFIED AND SEVERAL MORE </p><p>REPORTED THEY WERE COMPLETING THE RATIFICATION PROCESS </p><p>(OR THE ACCESSION PROCESS FOR THOSE THAT WILL NOT HAVE </p><p>SIGNED BEFORE THE DEADLINE PASSES).

HOWEVER, AMBASSADOR GERBASI DOES NOT ALWAYS </p><p>HOLD IN CHECK HIS G-77 LEANINGS AND HIS PROCEDURAL </p><p>RULINGS AND INTERVENTIONS OCCASIONALLY REFLECT THIS </p><p>TENDENCY. THE BUREAU OF SIX VICE-CHAIRPERSONS FROM THE </p><p>DIFFERENT REGIONS HAS AS FAVORABLE A COMPOSITION AS WE </p><p>COULD HAVE HOPED, INCLUDING BRAD FRALEIGH OF CANADA FOR </p><p>NORTH AMERICA, KRISTIANE HERMANN OF AUSTRALIA FOR SOUTH </p><p>WEST PACIFIC, AND GERT KLEIJER FROM SWITZERLAND FOR </p><p>EUROPE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>RULES OF PROCEDURE - CONSENSUS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  THE INTERIM COMMITTEE DEBATED AND ADOPTED ITS </p><p>OWN RULES OF PROCEDURE.  ON THE CRITICAL SUBJECT OF </p><p>DECISION-MAKING, IT WAS AGREED THAT ALL DECISIONS WERE TO </p><p>BE TAKEN BY CONSENSUS.  THE FACT THAT THE TREATY REQUIRES </p><p>CONSENSUS FOR DECISION MAKING PROVED A COMPELLING </p><p>ARGUMENT.  THE INTERIM COMMITTEE IN THE FUTURE WILL HAVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05252  02 OF 05  280813Z </p><p>TO DEVELOP PROPOSED RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR THE TREATY\'S </p><p>GOVERNING BODY TO CONSIDER AT ITS FIRST MEETING.  AN </p><p>OPEN-ENDED TECHNICAL AND LEGAL EXPERTS GROUP WILL BE SET </p><p>UP TO DEVELOP THIS PROPOSAL, AS WELL AS A PROPOSAL ON </p><p>FINANCIAL RULES AND ONE ON COMPLIANCE FOR CONSIDERATION </p><p>BY THE GOVERNING BODY.  IN RESPONSE TO AN EU PROPOSAL, </p><p>THE RULES OF PROCEDURES WERE WRITTEN TO PERMIT NATIONAL, </p><p>INSTEAD OF JUST INTERNATIONAL, NGOS TO BE OBSERVERS AT </p><p>THE INTERIM COMMITTEE.  THE USDEL BLOCKED THE PORTION OF </p><p>THE EU PROPOSAL THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE EXCLUSION OF </p><p>AN OBSERVER IF ONE-THIRD OF THE MEMBERS VOTED TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR MATERIAL TRANSFER AGREEMENT GROUP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) THE MEETING BECAME THE MOST CONTENTIOUS OVER </p><p>THE PIVOTAL MATTER OF SETTING THE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR </p><p>THE GROUP THAT WILL DEVELOP THE STANDARD MTA.  THE FAO </p><p>CONFERENCE HAS CALLED ON THE INTERIM COMMITTEE TO </p><p>ESTABLISH AN EXPERT GROUP TO HELP DEVELOP THE PROPOSED </p><p>TERMS OF THE STANDARD MTA.  FORTUNATELY, THE FAO </p><p>SECRETARIAT DREW HEAVILY ON A U.S.-PREPARED NON-PAPER ON </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE TERMS OF REFERENCE AS THE BASIS FOR DISCUSSION.  THE </p><p>U.S. ACHIEVED GENERALLY GOOD RESULTS ON THE THREE KEY </p><p>ASPECTS OF THE TERMS OF REFERENCE:  COMPOSITION OF THE </p><p>GROUP; PARTICIPATION OF NON-FAO ENTITIES; AND, THE </p><p>MANDATE FOR THE MTA GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) THE U.S. AND CANADA INITIALLY SOUGHT EQUAL </p><p>REPRESENTATION (FOUR PEOPLE) FOR THE NORTH AMERICA REGION </p><p>WITH THE OTHER SIX FAO REGIONS.  THE G-77 BALKED AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05252  02 OF 05  280813Z </p><p>PRESSED FOR NORTH AMERICA TO BE LIMITED TO TWO.  THE U.S. </p><p>TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERIM COMMITTEE\'S CONSENSUS RULE, </p><p>WITH CANADA\'S SUPPORT, AND INSISTED ON EQUAL </p><p>REPRESENTATION.  THE CHAIR WEIGHED IN WITH A </p><p>REPRESENTATION SCHEME USED BY THE CGRFA\'S TECHNICAL </p><p>WORKING GROUP ON PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES, WHICH WOULD </p><p>HAVE GIVEN NORTH AMERICA TWO REPRESENTATIVES AND FIVE FOR </p><p>EACH OF THE THREE LARGE G-77 REGIONS.  CANADA TOLD US </p><p>QUIETLY THAT THEY WOULD NOT BREAK CONSENSUS ON THIS ISSUE </p><p>AND WOULD ACCEPT THE CHAIR\'S PROPOSAL.  THE USDEL STAYED </p><p>FIRM, AND BEFORE CANADA ACQUIESCED, THE CHAIR PROPOSED A </p><p>CONTACT GROUP TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE.  THE CONTACT GROUP </p><p>REACHED A SATISFACTORY COMPROMISE FROM THE U.S. </p><p>PERSPECTIVE:  WE AGREED ON TWO REPRESENTATIVES PLUS TWO </p><p>ADVISERS FOR NORTH AMERICA (WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO BRING </p><p>IN TO THE ROOM THE INDUSTRY AND LEGAL EXPERTISE WE WANT </p><p>TO HAVE AVAILABLE); THE OTHER REGIONS WERE LIMITED TO </p><p>FOUR PER REGION WITH FOUR ADVISERS; AND IT WAS AGREED </p><p>THAT THE REPORT OF THE EXPERT GROUP TO THE INTERIM </p><p>COMMITTEE WOULD REFLECT ALL VIEWS ON AN EQUAL BASIS (NOT </p><p>PRESENT A MAJORITY VIEW WITH MINORITY VIEWS RELEGATED TO </p><p>A LOWER STATUS).

(SBU) COMMENT.  IT HAD BEEN CLEAR FROM THE START THAT </p><p>THE G-77 INTENDED THE MTA GROUP TO BE A POLITICAL </p><p>NEGOTIATING BODY AND NOT A GATHERING OF TECHNICAL AND </p><p>LEGAL EXPERTS.  NONETHELESS, THROUGH THE USE OF ADVISERS </p><p>WE - AS WELL AS AUSTRALIA AND EUROPE - WILL HAVE INDUSTRY </p><p>EXPERTISE IN THE NEGOTIATING ROOM.  WE BELIEVE THAT </p><p>HAVING THESE TRUE EXPERTS ON MTAS IN THE ROOM COULD HAVE </p><p>A PROFOUND, POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE NEGOTIATIONS.  THE </p><p>UPSIDE OF HAVING A POLITICAL NEGOTIATING GROUP IS THAT </p><p>THERE SHOULD BE GREATER ACCEPTANCE OF ANY CONSENSUS </p><p>RESULTS THAT ARE PRESENTED TO THE INTERIM COMMITTEE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) THE USDEL ALSO ACHIEVED THE OBJECTIVE OF </p><p>INCLUDING A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE IARCS WITH THE ABILITY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05252  03 OF 05  280814Z </p><p>TO PARTICIPATE.  THE G-77, IN PARTICULAR SOUTH AFRICA, </p><p>OPPOSED THE CGIAR PARTICIPATING, SAYING THAT THE IARCS </p><p>ARE "TAINTED" PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIANCE ON </p><p>FUNDING FROM AND THEIR GOOD WORKING TIES WITH OECD </p><p>COUNTRIES.  THE U.S. AND OTHER OECD COUNTRIES HELD FIRM, </p><p>FORCING THE G-77 EVENTUALLY TO CONCEDE THE POINT.  THE </p><p>U.S. AND OTHER OECD COUNTRIES ALSO BLOCKED THE G-77\'S </p><p>PROPOSAL TO INCLUDE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CONVENTION </p><p>ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (CBD).  THE EU WAS ABLE TO ADD TO </p><p>THE MTA GROUP A REPRESENTATIVE FROM WIPO AND ONE FROM </p><p>UPOV, WHO WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF </p><p>CALLED UPON. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) ON THE TASKS FOR THE MTA GROUP, THE G-77 </p><p>(ESPECIALLY IRAN, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, SOUTH AFRICA, </p><p>CAMEROON AND ANGOLA) SUCCEEDED IN A NUMBER OF CASES IN </p><p>SUPPLANTING SPECIFIC, LIMITED TASKS WITH BROADER, MORE </p><p>OPEN-ENDED ONES. G-77 EFFORTS WERE PARTICULARLY DIRECTED </p><p>AT BROADENING THE "BENEFIT-SHARING" PROVISIONS OF THE MTA </p><p>AND SEEKING WAYS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.  THIS MEANS THE </p><p>DEBATE IN THE MTA GROUP WILL LIKELY BE BROAD RANGING, </p><p>RATHER THAN LIMITED TO CLARIFYING A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL </p><p>POINTS.  THE USDEL, WORKING WITH CANADA, DID ACHIEVE </p><p>INCLUSION OF THE TASK OF ENSURING THE MTA WILL BECOME </p><p>BINDING UPON THE RECIPIENT\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE PGRFA. </p><p>(COMMENT: WHILE THE USDEL WOULD HAVE PREFERRED UPON THE </p><p>"RECEIPT" OF THE PGRFA, IT ACCEPTED CANADA\'S SUGGESTION </p><p>OF UPON "ACCEPTANCE" OF THE PGRFA. END COMMENT). THIS IS </p><p>AN IMPORTANT TECHNICAL POINT THAT WILL NEED TO BE </p><p>ADDRESSED FOR THE MTA TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05252  03 OF 05  280814Z </p><p>FINANCIAL RULES AND BUDGET </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) THE INTERIM COMMITTEE AT THIS MEETING AGREED ON </p><p>A PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING PROPOSED FINANCIAL RULES TO THE </p><p>GOVERNING BODY TO CONSIDER AT ITS FIRST MEETING.  THE </p><p>TECHNICAL AND LEGAL EXPERT GROUP MENTIONED ABOVE FOR </p><p>CONSIDERING THE GOVERNING BODY\'S RULES OF PROCEDURE WILL </p><p>ALSO PREPARE RECOMMENDATIONS ON FINANCIAL RULES.  THE </p><p>USDEL AND JAPAN AGREED WITH THE PROCESS, AND AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME THEY MADE CLEAR THAT THEY OPPOSED THE CONCEPT OF </p><p>USING "INDICATIVE ASSESSMENTS" WITH VOLUNTARY </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>13.

THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT CITING FAO RULES EFFECTIVELY PUT DOWN CALLS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>FOR THE FAO CORE BUDGET BE USED TO FUND THE TRAVEL OF G- </p><p>77 REPRESENTATIVES.  ONLY VOLUNTARY, EXTRA-BUDGETARY </p><p>FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

THE </p><p>U.S., CANAD AND JAPAN URGED THE SECRETARIAT TO LOOK FOR </p><p>COSTEFFICIENCIES.
