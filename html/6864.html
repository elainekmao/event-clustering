<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 001312 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR NTIA/GALLAGHER/SPECK AND </p><p>4220/MAC/EUR/SED/DDEFALCO; </p><p>FCC FOR AGOMEZ AND ATHOMAS; </p><p>JUSTICE FOR WILLNER </p><p></p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, ETRD, BEXP, EIND, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S LUNCH WITH TELECOM ITALIA MANAGING </p><p>DIRECTOR </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 1084 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY.  NOT </p><p>FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  AT A MARCH 19 LUNCH WITH TELECOM ITALIA </p><p>MANAGING DIRECTOR RICCARDO RUGGIERO, THE AMBASSADOR RAISED </p><p>ADVOCACY CASES INVOLVING U.S. TELECOM FIRMS TERADYNE, LUCENT </p><p>AND MOTOROLA.  HE ALSO STRESSED THAT MANY U.S. TELECOM FIRMS </p><p>WERE INTERESTED IN SELLING TO AND WORKING WITH TELECOM </p><p>ITALIA.  RUGGIERO ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THAT TI HAD </p><p>ELIMINATED THE BACKLOG IN MAKING FIXED LINES AVAILABLE TO </p><p>U.S. FIRMS, AND WOULD CONTINUE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO SUCH </p><p>REQUESTS. TELECOM ITALIA\'S RECENT MERGER WITH OLIVETTI WAS </p><p>NECESSARY TO RESTRUCTURE TI\'S COMPLEX OWNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS </p><p>AND MAKE THE FIRM MORE COMPETITIVE.  TI PLANS TO REDUCE DEBT </p><p>AND INVEST IN BROADBAND TECHNOLOGY OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. </p><p>3G AND CABLE, IN RUGGIERO\'S VIEW, ARE LESS VIABLE AND NOT </p><p>AREAS IN WHICH TI PLANS TO INVEST MANY RESOURCES.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ON MARCH 19, THE AMBASSADOR HELD A TOUR D\'HORIZON ON </p><p>TELECOM ISSUES WITH TELECOM ITALIA MANAGING DIRECTOR RICCARDO </p><p>RUGGIERO.  RUGGIERO WAS ACCOMPANIED BY STEFANO PILERI, HEAD </p><p>OF NETWORK AFFAIRS, AND SERGIO FOGLI, HEAD OF REGULATORY </p><p>    AFFAIRS.  THE AMBASSADOR WAS JOINED BY COMMERCIAL MINISTER </p><p>COUNSELOR AND ECONOMIC COUNSELOR. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) A NUMBER OF U.S. TELECOMMUNICATIONS FIRMS ARE </p><p>INTERESTED IN DEALING WITH TELECOM ITALIA, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>TOLD RUGGIERO.  IT IS IMPORTANT THE U.S. FIRMS BE CONSIDERED </p><p>AS TI ASSESSES ITS EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES NEEDS. </p><p>RUGGIERO RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THIS, NOTING THAT TI ALREADY </p><p>HAS SOME WELL-ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH U.S. FIRMS, SUCH </p><p>AS LUCENT AND MOTOROLA.  ONE ISSUE, HOWEVER, IS IN-COUNTRY </p><p>SERVICE.  RUGGIERO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT TI -- AT LEAST </p><p>FOR SUPPLIERS TO THE CORE AREA OF THE TI NETWORK -- MUST </p><p>PROVIDE FULL IN-COUNTRY SERVICE. U.S. FIRMS, HOWEVER, SEEMED </p><p>RELUCTANT TO ESTABLISH AN ADEQUATE STAFF IN ITALY.  THIS MADE </p><p>THEM FAR LESS COMPETITIVE.  EVEN LUCENT, NOTED RUGGIERO, HAD </p><p>DOWNGRADED ITS ITALIAN STAFF TO AN EXTENT THAT IT WAS </p><p>STARTING TO COMPROMISE SERVICE. </p><p> </p><p>LUCENT </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED ABOUT THE RENEWAL OF LUCENT\'S </p><p>CONTRACT TO SUPPLY OPTICAL EQUIPMENT FOR TI\'S BACKBONE. </p><p>RUGGIERO RESPONDED THAT DISCUSSIONS WERE ONGOING, BUT THAT </p><p>LUCENT\'S SMALL NUMBER OF ITALIAN STAFF PUT IT AT A </p><p>DISADVANTAGE IN RELATION TO OTHER BIDDERS.  AGAIN, RUGGIERO </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT TI HAD SEEN A DECLINE IN LUCENT\'S PERFORMANCE </p><p>SINCE THE DOWNSIZING OF THE LUCENT OPERATION IN ITALY. THIS </p><p>HAD TO BE A FACTOR IN THE DECISION, HE STRESSED.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT IF LUCENT OBTAINED A MAJOR CONTRACT -- </p><p>SUCH AS THE $100 MILLION TENDER FOR OPTICAL TRANSPORT NETWORK </p><p>EQUIPMENT THAT TI IS EXPECTED TO CALL THIS FALL -- THE FIRM </p><p>    WOULD BE ABLE TO INCREASE STAFF ACCORDINGLY.  HOWEVER, NO </p><p>FIRM COULD KEEP A LARGE STAFF IN ITALY IF IT DID NOT HAVE </p><p>CORRESPONDING BUSINESS.  RUGGIERO AGREED, BUT SAID THAT TI </p><p>HAD TO CONSIDER THIS FACTOR. </p><p> </p><p>TERADYNE </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) TURNING TO THE U.S. FIRM TERADYNE, THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>NOTED THAT THE FIRM HAD SUCCESSFULLY FINISHED A TWO-YEAR </p><p>DEMONSTRATION OF ITS STATE-OF-THE-ART AUTOMATIC TEST </p><p>EQUIPMENT AND TELECOM LINE TEST SOLUTIONS FOR BROADBAND.  THE </p><p>EQUIPMENT SEEMED TO HAVE PROVEN ITSELF IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY </p><p>AND COST.  HOW SOON MIGHT TI BE READY TO CONTRACT FOR SUCH </p><p>EQUIPMENT FOR USE ON ITS ENTIRE SYSTEM?  PILERI, THE TI </p><p>NETWORK EXPERT, RESPONDED THAT THE TERADYNE EQUIPMENT HAD </p><p>DONE VERY WELL, AND WOULD CERTAINLY BE A LEADING CONTENDER </p><p>FOR A CONTRACT WHEN TI WAS READY TO MOVE TO THIS TYPE OF </p><p>AUTOMATIC TEST EQUIPMENT.  HOWEVER, THIS WAS NOT LIKELY TO </p><p>OCCUR UNTIL 2004 OR 2005.  FIRST, TI MUST EXPAND ITS </p><p>BROADBAND CUSTOMER BASE SUBSTANTIALLY.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED </p><p>THAT TIMING WAS IMPORTANT.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT TERADYNE WAS </p><p>READY TO MOVE FORWARD NOW WITH EFFECTIVE AND ECONOMICAL </p><p>EQUIPMENT, WHICH COULD BE OF KEY IMPORTANCE TO TI AS IT </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00001312  002 OF 003 </p><p> </p><p> WAS </p><p>INTERESTED IN EXPANDING ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH TI IN THE AREA </p><p>OF WIFI.  RUGGIERO REPLIED THAT TI ALREADY KNEW MOTOROLA </p><p>WELL, AND WAS PLEASED THAT MOTOROLA WOULD BE WORKING ON A </p><p>CONTRACT FOR PUBLIC SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS USING ITS TETRA </p><p>TECHNOLOGY.  HE EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS FURTHER </p><p>JOINT EFFORTS WITH MOTOROLA. </p><p> </p><p>ACCESS TO TI LINES, EQUIPMENT, SERVICES, RIGHTS OF WAY </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) ACCESS TO TI LINES, EQUIPMENT, SERVICES AND RIGHTS </p><p>OF WAY BY U.S. FIRMS HAS BEEN A LONGSTANDING PROBLEM, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED.  WHILE WE HAVE HAD NO RECENT COMPLAINTS, </p><p>THIS WAS A KEY POINT FOR EXISTING FIRMS AND NEW U.S. </p><p>ENTRANTS.  RUGGIERO RESPONDED THAT HE, PRIOR TO JOINING TI, </p><p>HAD HIMSELF COMPLAINED OF THIS PROBLEM.  HE HAD MADE </p><p>RESOLVING IT A PRIORITY, AND COULD FINALLY ASSURE THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT TI HAD ELIMINATED THE BACKLOG OF REQUESTS. </p><p>THERE SHOULD BE NO FURTHER PROBLEMS FOR U.S. FIRMS IN </p><p>OBTAINING SUCH ACCESS. </p><p> </p><p>    TELECOM ITALIA: RESTRUCTURING </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) JUST DAYS BEFORE THE LUNCH, TELECOM ITALIA HAD </p><p>ANNOUNCED A MERGER WITH OLIVETTI.  RUGGIERO EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>THIS MERGER WAS NECESSARY TO SIMPLIFY TI\'S OWNERSHIP </p><p>STRUCTURE AND MAKE THE COMPANY MORE ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS. </p><p>SOME STOCKHOLDERS HAD CRITICIZED THE MERGER ON THE GROUNDS </p><p>THAT IT WOULD INCREASE TI\'S DEBT FROM E 18 BILLION TO E 42 </p><p>BILLION.  HOWEVER, RUGGIERO EXPLAINED THAT TI HAD PLANS TO </p><p>RETURN THE DEBT LEVEL TO E 18 BILLION OR LESS WITHIN TWO </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>NEW TECHNOLOGIES:  BROADBAND </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) RUGGIERO ASSERTED THAT THE ITALIAN MARKET FOR </p><p>TRADITIONAL HARD LINE AND MOBILE TELEPHONES WAS SATURATED. </p><p>THE FUTURE WAS BROADBAND.  TI\'S TOP PRIORITY WAS DEVELOPING </p><p>BROADBAND IN ITALY.  THE COMPANY HOPES TO MOVE FROM TODAY\'S </p><p>ONE MILLION BROADBAND CUSTOMERS TO FIVE MILLION WITHIN TWO </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>NEW TECHNOLOGIES: 3G </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) WHAT, ASKED THE AMBASSADOR WAS THE FUTURE OF 3G IN </p><p>ITALY? RUGGIERO REPLIED THAT THE FIRST 3G SERVICES WOULD </p><p>BEGIN LATER THIS YEAR. HOWEVER, HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR, 3G </p><p>WAS UNLIKELY TO THRIVE IN THE ITALIAN MARKET.  ITALIANS PAY </p><p>AN AVERAGE OF ONE EURO PER MOBILE TELEPHONE CALL.  3G CALLS </p><p>WOULD COST AN AVERAGE OF FIVE EUROS EACH.  RUGGIERO FELT </p><p>STRONGLY THAT THE ADDITION OF A PICTURE WOULD NOT PROVIDE </p><p>SUFFICIENT INCENTIVE FOR ITALIANS TO PAY THE ADDED COST. </p><p>    EVEN NOW, HE SAID, 90 PERCENT OF ITALIAN MOBILE TELEPHONE </p><p>USERS USED PREPAID CARDS RATHER THAN CONTRACTING FOR SERVICE. </p><p> MOST OF THESE ONLY RECEIVED CALLS, BUT DID NOT MAKE (OR PAY </p><p>FOR) THEM. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) WHILE TWO COMPANIES, HUTCHINSON WHAMPOA AND IPSE </p><p>000, HAVE ADVERTISED HEAVILY THEIR UPCOMING 3G LAUNCHES, </p><p>RUGGIERO NOTED THAT THESE TWO FIRMS DO NOT HAVE EXISTING </p><p>TELECOM SERVICES TO SELL.  THEY NEED TO PUT 3G SERVICES IN </p><p>PLACE FOR REVENUES.  HOWEVER, TO DO SO, THE NEW ENTRANTS WILL </p><p>NEED TO FIND AND RENT SPACE FOR AROUND 1,000 CELLS AND THEN </p><p>BUILD EQUIPMENT.  THE OTHER 3G LICENSE HOLDERS (INCUMBENTS </p><p>TELECOM ITALIA MOBILE, WIND AND VODAFONE OMNITEL) ALREADY </p><p>HAVE LOCATIONS RENTED AND WILL ONLY HAVE TO ADD EQUIPMENT. </p><p>NONETHELESS, SAID RUGGIERO, THE INCUMBENTS ARE LIKELY TO </p><p>DELAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE THE COSTLY INVESTMENT IN 3G </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) TELECOM ITALIA SEEMS FOCUSED THROUGH 2005 ON (1) </p><p>PAYING DOWN DEBT AND (2) EXPANDING BROADBAND SERVICES.  WHILE </p><p>U.S. FIRMS MAY CONVINCE TI TO PURCHASE CERTAIN EQUIPMENT, </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00001312  003 OF 003 </p><p> </p><p>K TO DELAY MAJOR PURCHASES. </p><p>ON THE MORE POSITIVE SIDE, HOWEVER, RUGGIERO AND HIS TEAM </p><p>SEEM WILLING TO PROVIDE U.S. FIRMS WITH ACCESS TO LINES, </p><p>EQUIPMENT, SERVICES AND RIGHTS OF WAY.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THIS AND HOW TI TREATS U.S. FIRMS OVERALL. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01312 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
