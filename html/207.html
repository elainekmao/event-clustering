<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 01795 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  ECON, PREL, SY, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  A SYRIAN DIPLOMAT\'S VIEW OF LIFE IN TEHRAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  SOME SUBJECTIVE IMPRESSIONS OF </p><p>LIFE IN THE IRANIAN CAPITAL FROM A SYRIAN DIPLOMAT </p><p>PAINT A GLOOMY PICTURE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MR. HUSNI DIAB IS THE RECENTLY RETURNED SYRIAN </p><p>COMMERCIAL COUNSELOR IN TEHRAN (RETURNED TO </p><p>DAMASCUS MARCH 14).  HE IS A SUNNI DAMASCENE OF </p><p>GOOD FAMILY WHO HAS SPENT THE BULK OF HIS CAREER </p><p>IN THE BANKING SECTOR, FIRST WORKING FOR PRIVATE </p><p>BANKS IN DAMASCUS, THEN FOR THE COMMERCIAL BANK </p><p>OF SYRIA AFTER THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKING </p><p>SECTOR IN THE 1960S.  PRIOR TO DEPARTING FOR HIS </p><p>MISSION IN TEHRAN, HE SPENT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AT </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FOREIGN TRADE, WORKING </p><p>WITH HIS OLD MENTOR AND UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, MINISTER </p><p>OF ECONOMY AND FOREIGN TRADE, MOHAMMED IMADI </p><p>(WHO WAS ALSO MINISTER OF ECONOMY IN THE LATE </p><p>1970S).  MR. DIAB HAS SPENT THE LAST FIVE YEARS </p><p>IN TEHRAN.  HE IS ALSO A FORMER AID GRANTEE WHO </p><p>TRAINED WITH U.S. BANKS IN THE EARLY 1960S. </p><p> </p><p>-   -------------------- </p><p>4.  LIFE UNDER THE SCUDS </p><p>-   -------------------- </p><p> </p><p>IN A TYPICAL, FATALISTIC WAY, DIAB SAID THAT DURING </p><p>THE RECENT PERIOD OF MISSILE ATTACKS HE PUT HIM- </p><p>SELF TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WITH A VALIUM.  HE WENT ON </p><p>TO SAY THAT IT WAS NOT SO BAD DURING THE DAY WHEN </p><p>THE NOISE OF THE CITY WOULD DROWN OUT THE SOUND </p><p>OF DISTANT MISSILES FALLING.  BUT IN THE QUIET OF </p><p>THE NIGHT, THE SOUND WAS ALL TOO CLEAR.  DIAB </p><p>ESTIMATED THAT OF A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY </p><p>10 MILLION, ABOUT 30 PERCENT VACATED THE CITY AT </p><p>NIGHT.  "THE WEALTHIER TEHRANIS GO AND STAY IN </p><p>THEIR SUMMER HOUSES OR WITH RELATIVES IN THE OUT- </p><p>LYING VILLAGES AND COUNTRYSIDE.  ANYONE WITH A </p><p>CAR WILL DRIVE OUTSIDE OF THE CITY AND SLEEP IN </p><p>THE CAR OR CAMP." </p><p> </p><p>-   ----------------- </p><p>5.  IRANIAN OFFICIALS </p><p>-   ----------------- </p><p> </p><p>DIAB SAID THAT THE TOP LEVEL IRANIAN OFFICIALS HE </p><p>DEALT  WITH WERE INCOMPETENT AND UNTRAINED.  MID- </p><p>LEVEL OFFICIALS, PARTICULARLY IN THE BUSINESS AND </p><p>ECONOMIC SECTORS, HAD OVERWHELMINGLY BEEN TRAINED </p><p>IN THE U.S.  HE ADDED THAT HE FREQUENTLY PASSED </p><p>THE U.S. EMBASSY BUILDING ON HIS WAY TO AN ADJACENT </p><p>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BUILDING.  HE SAID THE PREMISES </p><p>ARE STILL MANNED BY REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS BUT NOT </p><p>USED.  DIAB\'S COMMENTS ON THE IRANIAN BUREAUCRACY </p><p>WERE SCATHING.  "A SINGLE, SIMPLE TRANSACTION </p><p>CAN TAKE THREE OR FOUR MONTHS TO COMPLETE.  TO </p><p>ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING REQUIRES AT LEAST THREE OR </p><p>FOUR SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS.  THE IRANIAN BUREAUC- </p><p>RACY IS A NIGHTMARE TO DEAL WITH."  CONSIDERING </p><p>THAT THE SYRIAN BUREAUCRACY\'S PACE IS CLOSER TO </p><p>THE TORTOISE THAN THE HARE, THIS IS STRONG LANGUAGE </p><p>INDEED. </p><p> </p><p>-   ------------------------- </p><p>6.  IRANIAN TOURISTS IN SYRIA </p><p>-   ------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>DIAB AGREED THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT PAYS </p><p>SYRIAN GOVERNMENT $250 PER TOURIST FOR A ONE </p><p>WEEK TRIP TO SYRIA, INCLUDING FOOD AND TRANSPOR- </p><p>TATION.  HE SAID THE ARRANGEMENT IS FOR TWO </p><p>THOUSAND TOURISTS PER WEEK.  HE DENIED THAT </p><p>FAMILIES OF MARTYRS ARE PROVIDED THIS TRIP AS A </p><p>FREE BONUS.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, HE SAID </p><p>THAT UNDER BLACK MARKET RATES FOR THE IRANIAN </p><p>CURRENCY THE AVERAGE IRANIAN PAYS APPROXIMATELY </p><p>$80 FOR THE TOUR.  HE SAID FOR THE MOST PART THE </p><p>TRAVELERS ARE POOR VILLAGERS AND/OR RELIGIOUS </p><p>ADHERENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN VISITING DAMASCUS\' </p><p>MOSQUES AND SHRINES.  THE WEALTHIER IRANIANS, HE </p><p>ADDED, PARTICULARLY NOW DURING THE ANNUAL FEAST </p><p>OF NAWRUZ, ARE TRAVELING TO EUROPE, CANADA AND </p><p>THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>-   -------------- </p><p>7.  FUNDAMENTALISM </p><p>-   -------------- </p><p> </p><p>DIAB WAXED PHILOSOPHICAL REGARDING THE CAUSES OF </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM IN IRAN.  ESSENTIALLY, IT BOILED </p><p>DOWN TO AN OPINION THAT THE SHAH IGNORED THE </p><p>GROWING GAP BETWEEN THE SMALL WEALTHY ELITE AND </p><p>THE GREAT MASS OF POOR.  THE SHAH SHOULD HAVE </p><p>DEVOTED MORE TIME AND MONEY TO PROVIDING ROADS, </p><p>ELECTRICITY, CLEAN WATER AND EDUCATION TO THE </p><p>MASSES AND NOT TO BEAUTIFYING EXCLUSIVE PARTS OF </p><p>TEHRAN AND OTHER CITIES.  THE POOR REACTED BY </p><p>TURNING TO RELIGION AND THE REVOLUTION WAS BORN. </p><p>NOW, EVEN FOR A FRIENDLY SYRIAN DIPLOMAT, LIFE </p><p>IS DIFFICULT.  THE BUREAUCRACY IS SLOW AND </p><p>STUPID.  THE ECONOMY IS IN TROUBLE AND THERE ARE </p><p>SHORTAGES OF ALL KINDS.  LAST, BUT NOT LEAST, </p><p>THE SCUDS ARE FALLING. </p><p> </p><p>8.  WHEN DIAB RECEIVED WORD OF HIS REASSIGNMENT </p><p>HOME, HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE EMBASSY CAME BY TO </p><p>CONGRATULATE HIM.  EVEN THE BENEFITS OF LIVING </p><p>ABROAD ON A DOLLAR SALARY, APPARENTLY, DO NOT </p><p>COMPENSATE FOR THE HARDSHIPS OF LIVING IN TEHRAN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.  EAGLETON </p><p></p></div>
