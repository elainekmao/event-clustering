<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIJING 15491 </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING MESSAGE TRANSMITS CHENGDU 622 QUOTE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356:N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, PGOV, PHUM, CH </p><p>SUBJECT:  CHENGDU STALEMATE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  CHENGDU 619 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY:  AS OF 1600 ON 6/5, THERE IS A </p><p>STALEMATE IN DOWNTOWN CHENGDU BETWEEN PROTESTERS WHO </p><p>FLOOD THE STREETS AND CONTINUE TO BURN SOME VEHICLES, </p><p>AND TROOPS WHICH HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN THE MUNICIPAL </p><p>OFFICE COMPOUND AND OCCASIONALLY LOB TEAR GAS </p><p>INEFFECTIVELY INTO THE CROWD.  STUDENTS REPRESENT A </p><p>DISTINCT MINORITY OF THE CROWDS.  MANY WORKERS SAID </p><p>THAT THEIR FACTORIES HAVE ALREADY UNOFFICIALLY GONE </p><p>ON STRIKE, AND THE NUMBERS OF SPECTATORS FAR </p><p>SURPASSES USUAL LEVELS ON THE MIDDAY STREETS.  NO NEW </p><p>CASUALTIES ARE REPORTED, BUT DEATH TOLLS FROM THE 6/4 </p><p>RIOT CONTINUE TO MOUNT.  OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL AREA </p><p>AROUND CHENGDU\'S MAO STATUE, CITY ACTIVITY APPEARS </p><p>NORMAL, EXCEPT THAT NO POLICE OR TROOPS ARE IN </p><p>EVIDENCE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   NO NEW FIGHTING OR CONFRONTATIONS HAVE TAKEN </p><p>PLACE IN CHENGDU AS OF 1600 ON JUNE 5.  TROOPS FROM </p><p>THE PEOPLE\'S ARMED POLICE AND FIRE-FIGHTERS </p><p>ESSENTIALLY ABANDONED THE DOWNTOWN AREA AROUND THE </p><p>MAO STATUE AS WELL AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE STILL </p><p>SMOULDERING PEOPLE\'S MARKET AT APPROXIMATELY 0900, </p><p>NOR ARE THE REGULAR POLICE EVIDENT ANYWHERE IN TOWN. </p><p>THEY HAVE RETREATED TO THE SANCTITY OF THE MUNICIPAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT COMPOUND NEXT TO THE MAO STATUE.  A FEW </p><p>ON-LOOKERS HIJACKED A MUNICIPAL BUS, PARKED IN THE </p><p>ENTRANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL COMPOUND TO CUT OFF EGRESS, </p><p>AND SET IT ON FIRE AT ABOUT 1100.  THIS BURNED-OUT </p><p>VEHICLE JOINS THE OTHER BUSES, FIRE ENGINES AND </p><p>MILITARY VEHICLES BURNED ON 6/4.  CROWDS HAVE SET </p><p>FIRE TO SEVERAL OTHER VEHICLES AT AN EVER-EXPANDING </p><p>RADIUS FROM THE CENTRAL MAO STAUTE DURING MIDDAY </p><p>6/5.  TROOPS HAVE SEVERAL TIMES LOBBED TEAR GAS FROM </p><p>THE MUNICIPAL COMPOUND INTO THE CROWD BUT WITHOUT </p><p>NOTICEABLE EFFECT. </p><p> </p><p>3.   CROWDS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA NUMBER UP TO 10,000 </p><p>PEOPLE, MOSTLY WORKERS OR UNEMPLOYED YOUTHS.  THEY </p><p>ARE FAR GREATER THAN WOULD BE USUAL ON A MONDAY AT </p><p>MIDDAY, AND THEY HAVE CUT OFF ALL VEHICULAR TRAFFIC </p><p>IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA NEAR THE MAO STATUE.  THERE ARE </p><p>STUDENTS PRESENT, BUT THEY REPRESENT A DISTINCT </p><p>MINORITY.  CONTRARY TO EARLIER RUMORS, THERE ARE NO </p><p>TROOPS VISIBLE AT THE GATES OF ANY OF THE MAJOR </p><p>CHENGDU-AREA UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, AND FOREIGN </p><p>EXPERTS DO NOT REPORT ANY ON-CAMPUS PRESENCE. </p><p>OUTSIDE THE SEVERAL BLOCKS AROUND THE MAO STATUE AND </p><p>RENMIN NANLU -- THE TRADITIONAL DEMONSTRATION SITES </p><p>-- LIFE IN THE CITY APPEARS TO BE NORMAL, WITH PEOPLE </p><p>GOING ABOUT THEIR USUAL WORK AND ALL BUT A FEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT-OWNED STORES OPEN FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL. </p><p>MANY AMERICAN FOREIGN TEACHERS AND STUDENTS ARE NOW </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO REUTRN TO THE U.S. IN THE NEXT FEW </p><p>DAYS, A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE SCHEDULED COMPLETION OF </p><p>CLASSES.  THEY REPORT THAT MANY STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY </p><p>LEFT CAMPUS TO RETURN HOME OR TO JOIN THE PROTEST </p><p>MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.   SOME WORKERS IN THE CROWD SAY THEY HAVE ALREADY </p><p>GONE ON STRIKE, ALBEIT UNOFFICIALLY, AND WILL NOT </p><p>RETURN TO WORK UNTIL THE SITUATION HAS BEEN </p><p>RESOLVED.  THE CITY GOVERNMENT ISSUED A NOTICE TO ALL </p><p>WORK UNITS ON 6/5 REQUIRING THEM TO ORGANIZE THEIR </p><p>WORKERS EFFECTIVELY TO PROTECT PROPERTY AND TO ENSURE </p><p>EVENING GUARD DUTY.  THE REGULATIONS ALSO PROHIBIT </p><p>CITIZENS FROM INTERFERING WITH THE FLOW OF POLICE </p><p>TRAFFIC OR FROM RUSHING TO THE SITES OF FIRES OR </p><p>UNREST.  MANY SHOPS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA REMAIN </p><p>CLOSED. </p><p> </p><p>5.   ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN NO NEW REPORTED </p><p>CASUALTIES SO FAR ON 6/5, APART FROM ONE UNCONSCIOUS </p><p>YOUTH RUSHED FROM THE MAO STATUE TO A NEAR-BY </p><p>HOSPITAL WITH NO APPARENT WOUND (PERHAPS OVERCOME BY </p><p>TEAR GAS OR THE HEAT), THE 6/4 DEATH TOLLS FROM </p><p>APPARENTLY CONFIRMED ACCOUNTS INCREASE.  A WORKER AT </p><p>THE WEST CHINA MEDICAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL SAID THAT </p><p>HIS HOSPITAL ALONE HAD HAD SEVEN DEATHS FROM THE 6/4 </p><p>RIOT, INCLUDING TWO STUDENTS OF THAT UNIVERSITY, AS </p><p>WELL AS 35 INJURED STUDENTS.  A SENIOR OFFICIAL OF </p><p>SICHUAN UNIVERSITY TOLD FOREIGN EXPERTS THAT NINE </p><p>SICHUAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE NOW BEEN CONFIRMED </p><p>DEAD, AND MANY MORE MISSING.  REPORTS OF GUNFIRE BY </p><p>THE TROOPS ON 6/4 CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE AND GROW MORE </p><p>SPECIFIC ABOUT THE TIME AND PLACE, BUT THESE REMAIN </p><p>UNCONFIRMED. </p><p> </p><p>6.   THE STALEMATE CONTINUES AND THE RESTLESS CROWDS </p><p>AWAIT EVENTUAL POLICE REACTION, PROBABLY SOME TIME </p><p>DURING THE NIGHT.  DE WILDE.  END QUOTE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LILLEY </p><p></p></div>
