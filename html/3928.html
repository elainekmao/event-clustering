O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, EFIN, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZIMBABWE\'S FOREX/FUEL QUANDARY </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 2102 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Zimbabwe\'s fuel shortage has worsened. </p><p>Each new Libyan demand for foreign exchange sets off an </p><p>eleventh hour crisis, as the GoZ seeks to wean hard </p><p>currency from a rapidly shrinking economy.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Scapegoating Suppliers </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) In a new twist since our last report (ref), the </p><p>GoZ has sought to deflect attention from the forex </p><p>squeeze by lashing out at both parastatal NOCZIM and </p><p>private oil companies.  With angry commuters stranded </p><p>last Thursday, Energy Ministry officials insisted </p><p>publicly that downstream operators were hoarding fuel. </p><p>In calmer moments, GoZ technocrats dismissed these </p><p>charges for us, acknowledging that the GoZ had once again </p><p>fallen short of forex. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Lines at the pumps disappeared abruptly over the </p><p>weekend.  An end to the shortage?  On the contrary, an </p><p>oil executive told us the Energy Ministry had ordered him </p><p>to service only retail customers, leaving commercial </p><p>clients in a lurch.  Normally, the firms sells 60 percent </p><p>of its fuel on commercial markets.  He believed other </p><p>downstreamers received similar instructions. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (U) On one hand, the GoZ\'s behavior is unremarkable. </p><p>It invoked an implausible fable about hoarded reserves, </p><p>falling back on its habitual bias against free markets. </p><p>Then it diverted fuel from Zimbabwe\'s productive sector, </p><p>a certain recipe for national impoverishment, but not </p><p>surprising from a government that has frittered away one- </p><p>third of its GDP. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On the other hand, the GoZ betrayed a perceptible </p><p>touchiness over long gas lines, perhaps fearing the </p><p>consequences and fall-out of a prolonged shortage.  If it </p><p>wants to avert this recurring nightmare, the GoZ may one </p><p>day have to reconcile policy with stubborn macroeconomic </p><p>facts, namely that a) it lacks fuel because it lacks </p><p>forex and b) it would ultimately raise forex by devaluing </p><p>its currency and shoring up exports.  Not an option the </p><p>government of Robert Mugabe would relish, but possibly </p><p>more attractive than a nationwide standstill. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
