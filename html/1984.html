(U) SUPREME COURT JUDGE JOSE LECAROS INDICTED FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT ALBERTO FUJIMORI SEPTEMBER 13 FOR HIS ALLEGED </p><p>COMPLICITY IN THE BARRIOS ALTOS (1991) AND LA CANTUTA </p><p>(1992) KILLINGS AS WELL AS THE 1997 MURDER OF NATIONAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AGENT MARIELLA BARRETO.  BEGINNING THE </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE (INSTRUCTION) PHASE OF THE TRIAL, LECAROS </p><p>WILL FORMULATE IN THE COMING DAYS AN OFFICIAL REQUEST FOR </p><p>INTERPOL TO LOCATE FUJIMORI AND ASSIST IN HIS DETENTION. </p><p>(PRESS REPORTS INDICATE HE HAS ALREADY DONE SO.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE INDICTMENT FOLLOWS THE LIFTING OF FUJIMORI\'S </p><p>IMMUNITY BY CONGRESS IN AUGUST.  TWO WEEKS AGO, ATTORNEY </p><p>GENERAL NELLY CALDERON FILED THE CHARGES AGAINST THE FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT.  THE PROSECUTOR WORKING ON THE CASE ALLEGES THAT </p><p>FUJIMORI USED HIS INFLUENCE TO IMPEDE CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF THE KILLINGS AND GRANTED AMNESTY TO THE </p><p>PERSONS RESPONSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (U) UNDER PERUVIAN PROCEDURES, CHARGES AGAINST A </p><p>PRESIDENT MUST BE HANDLED BY THE SUPREME COURT.  (CASES </p><p>AGAINST LEGISLATORS OR MINISTERS GO TO SUPERIOR COURT FOR </p><p>INVESTIGATION AND ADJUDICATION.)  ONE OF ITS JUDGES, </p><p>USUALLY THE LEAST SENIOR, ACTS AS A JUDGE OF INSTRUCTION TO </p><p>REVIEW THE EVIDENCE.  WHEN THE JUDGE COMPLETES THIS </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE PHASE, HE SUBMITS THE CASE TO THE COURT FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        LIMA  05083  142156Z </p><p>TRIAL, IF WARRANTED.  THE ACCUSED CAN BE TRIED IN ABSENTIA, </p><p>THOUGH SENTENCING -- IF FOUND GUILTY -- WAITS UNTIL THE </p><p>PERSON IS IN CUSTODY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) COMMENT: PERUVIANS, CHARACTERIZING FUJIMORI\'S </p><p>ALLEGED COMPLICITY AS CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, SEE THE </p><p>INDICTMENT AS ANOTHER STEP TOWARD THE FORMER PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>EXTRADITION.  JAPAN, HOWEVER, HAS REITERATED THAT IT WILL </p><p>NOT EXTRADITE FUJIMORI.  THE EVIDENCE THAT HAS CARRIED THE </p><p>CHARGES AGAINST FUJIMORI THIS FAR IS LARGELY </p><p>CIRCUMSTANTIAL.  NONETHELESS, IT IS LIKELY THAT LECAROS </p><p>WILL CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROCEED </p><p>WITH A TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
