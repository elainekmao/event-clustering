<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000827 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; INL/AAE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, PINS, VM, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT:  LARGE DRUG CASE IN LAI CHAU PROVINCE RESULTS </p><p>--         IN SEIZURES, DEATH SENTENCES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  02 Hanoi 618 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY.   Vietnam\'s state-controlled media gave </p><p>prominent coverage to what was described as the "largest </p><p>drug case ever" in the northwestern province of Lai Chau. </p><p>The trial concluded on March 14, with the provincial </p><p>people\'s court handing down six death sentences (two others </p><p>had also been sentenced to death last June), 11 life </p><p>imprisonments, and other lengthy prison terms.  The case </p><p>also gained prominence due to the unusual murder of an </p><p>undercover police officer.  Relative to the probable large </p><p>quantities of heroin transiting the province, the amount </p><p>seized during this case was relatively modest.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>LAI CHAU --  A DRUG "HOTSPOT" </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Lai Chau province in northwestern Vietnam shares </p><p>borders of 180 miles with the PRC and 215 miles with Laos. </p><p>It is one of Vietnam\'s premier drug "hotspots" (reftel) as a </p><p>main smuggling route for Golden Triangle heroin and, more </p><p>recently, for amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).  Bui Xuan </p><p>Hieu, Chief of the International Cooperation and Project </p><p>Management Division in the national Standing Office for Drug </p><p>Control, reaffirmed to Pol FSN on April 1 that the drug </p><p>situation in the province remained "very difficult," </p><p>especially around the Tay Trang border crossing area.  He </p><p>noted that, at a conference to review drug control and </p><p>prostitution prevention held in Hanoi this past March, Prime </p><p>Minister Phan Van Khai had expressed special concern over </p><p>the "serious" drug trafficking from the province.  Hieu (who </p><p>attended the conference) recalled that the Prime Minister </p><p>had instructed that all "relevant law enforcement agencies" </p><p>in Lai Chau province pursue a more coordinated approach to </p><p>battle the traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>CASE BACKGROUND </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  According to the "People\'s Police" newspaper, Lai </p><p>Chau counternarcotics police first detected the case in </p><p>September 2001.  Several suspects, in an attempt to escape </p><p>arrest, murdered an undercover police lieutenant.  Three </p><p>suspects were eventually arrested; two received death </p><p>sentences in June 2002 for the police officer\'s murder. </p><p>Subsequently, 27 accomplices were arrested; 24 stood trial </p><p>in Lai Chau in March 2003.  On March 14, Lai Chau People\'s </p><p>Court handed down four additional death sentences, eleven </p><p>life sentences, and seven other long prison sentences. </p><p>These defendants were convicted of trafficking about ninety </p><p>kilograms of heroin over the past seven years from Laos via </p><p>the Tay Trang border area, through Lai Chau province, and on </p><p>to Hanoi and Thanh Hoa province (about 100 miles south of </p><p>Hanoi). </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>MORE TO COME? </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Without citing specific details, Nguyen Van Hanh, </p><p>Director of the  Lai Chau People\'s Committee Foreign Affairs </p><p>Office, told FSN that the provincial counternarcotics police </p><p>are developing other drug trafficking cases based on </p><p>information obtained from these defendants.  Hanh claimed </p><p>that "even larger" cases will come to light in the "near </p><p>future," possibly involving provincial officials. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Despite the public trumpeting of this case and </p><p>the harsh sentences, there is less here than meets the eye. </p><p>While the seizures from this case were significant by local </p><p>standards, foreign law enforcement sources, the UN, and </p><p>DEA\'s Hanoi Country Office estimate that perhaps "hundreds" </p><p>of kilograms of heroin are transiting Lai Chau province </p><p>annually.  Nationwide, at least 55 people were executed for </p><p>drug offenses last year; according to Vietnamese law, </p><p>possession of even 300 grams of heroin can result in the </p><p>death penalty. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
