(U) Classified by Acting DCM Thomas E. Williams for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Econoff delivered ref demarche, as well as an </p><p>Arabic translation of WIPO\'s Digital Agenda, to UAE </p><p>Ministry of Information Director of Copyrights Ali Al- </p><p>Baloushi on June 21.  Al-Baloushi noted that the protection </p><p>of intellectual property on the Internet, and the expansion </p><p>of e-commerce, is a priority for the UAEG.  The UAEG is </p><p>carefully studying the language of the WIPO treaties, with </p><p>the intention of acceding within the next year. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Al-Baloushi recounted the several steps that the </p><p>UAEG -- and Dubai Government, in particular -- has taken to </p><p>protect intellectual property on the Internet.  The UAEG </p><p>enacted in July 2002 Law No. 7 for Copyright and </p><p>Neighboring Rights, which in addition to other works, </p><p>affords protection to computer software and databases. </p><p>Also in 2002, the Dubai Government passed the "Law of </p><p>Electronic Transactions and Commerce No. 2/2002," which </p><p>protects certain electronic records and signatures, and </p><p>some electronic communications.  The Dubai law also </p><p>provides penalties for any person who knowingly creates, </p><p>publishes or otherwise makes available a false signature or </p><p>certificate, or provides false statements online for </p><p>fraudulent or any other unlawful purpose.  Most recently in </p><p>March 2003, the International Bar Association hosted a </p><p>conference in Dubai entitled, "Middle East Law and the </p><p>Internet Age."  The conference addressed the legal </p><p>developments related to new technologies, with a focus on </p><p>e-commerce in the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: Dubai already has taken important steps </p><p>consistent with the spirit of the WIPO Internet Treaties to </p><p>protect intellectual property on the web.  Federal-level </p><p>legislation probably will trail the efforts of more </p><p>progressive Dubai -- the future success of Dubai Internet </p><p>City and Dubai International Financial Center will depend </p><p>on the Government\'s ability to protect electronic </p><p>transactions and intellectual property rights in </p><p>cyberspace.  Al-Baloushi said that the UAEG is working </p><p>closely with WIPO to create and implement an effective IPR </p><p>regime that meets international standards.  We will </p><p>continue to monitor and report the UAE\'s progress in this </p><p>area, and forward any request for USG assistance that we </p><p>receive.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
