(U) IN THE VATICAN, WHERE GESTURES AND SYMBOLS CARRY </p><p>WEIGHT, POPE JOHN PAUL II PULLED OUT ALL THE STOPS DURING </p><p>ROMANIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH TEOCTIST\'S OCTOBER 7-13 VISIT TO </p><p>VATICAN CITY AND THE CITY OF ROME.  IN A SERIES OF EVENTS </p><p>CULMINATING IN A SPECIAL MASS IN ST. PETER\'S, THE PATRIARCH </p><p>WAS ACCORDED THE HIGHEST OF HONORS PEPPERED WITH WARM </p><p>FRATERNAL EMBRACES.  THE VISIT WAS REMARKABLY SIMILAR IN </p><p>POMP AND PROTOCOL TO A PAPAL VISIT ABROAD, AND WAS INTENDED </p><p>TO RECIPROCATE THE WARM RECEPTION THE POPE RECEIVED IN </p><p>ROMANIA IN 1999.  WHILE THE POPE AND THE PATRIARCH ARE GOOD </p><p>FRIENDS, THE HEARTY WELCOME TEOCTIST RECEIVED IS A CLEAR </p><p>SIGN TO THE REST OF EUROPE\'S ORTHODOX COMMUNITY THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS VIGOROUS PURSUIT OF CLOSER </p><p>RELIGIOUS AND GEOPOLITICAL TIES TO ORTHODOX EUROPE IN ORDER </p><p>TO FURTHER POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S LONG-HELD VISION OF EUROPE </p><p>EXTENDING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URAL MOUNTAINS. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ROLLING OUT THE RED CARPET </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) PATRIARCH TEOCTIST\'S "UNOFFICIAL" INTRODUCTION TO </p><p>VATICAN CITY STATE BY THE POPE OCCURRED BEFORE AN AUDIENCE </p><p>OF SOME 250,000 PILGRIMS ATTENDING THE CANONIZATION OF THE </p><p>FOUNDER OF OPUS DEI.  THE HOLY SEE USED THE OCCASION TO </p><p>HONOR TEOCTIST\'S STATUS AS A NATIONAL ORTHODOX LEADER -- </p><p>THROUGHOUT HIS VISIT HE WAS SEATED ON THE SAME LEVEL AS THE </p><p>POPE IN AN IDENTICAL CHAIR.  PATRIARCH TEOCTIST\'S SCHEDULE </p><p>INCLUDED VISITS TO ROME\'S MAJOR BASILICAS.  IN EACH HE WAS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05138  01 OF 02  221043Z </p><p>ACCORDED THE HIGHEST OF HONORS.  THE PATRIARCH ALSO VISITED </p><p>THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY WHERE HE SPOKE OF CONSTRUCTING A </p><p>CHRISTIAN EUROPE AND ON THE PERSECUTION SUFFERED BY ORTHODOX </p><p>CHRISTIANS AT THE HANDS OF THE COMMUNISTS.  PATRIARCH </p><p>TEOCTIST WAS GIVEN THE PULPIT DURING A MASS IN ST. PETER\'S </p><p>BASILICA THAT MARKED THE CONCLUSION OF HIS VISIT.  IN HIS </p><p>SERMON, HE URGED CHRISTIANS TO FILL THE VOID LEFT IN THE </p><p>EUROPEAN PSYCHE BY SECULARIZATION AND EXPRESSED HIS </p><p>GRATITUDE TO THE SANT\'EGIDIO COMMUNITY FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EFFORTS TO PROMOTE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE WORLD\'S PEOPLES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>OVERCOMING DIFFERENCES:  PROPERTY AND PROSELYTISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) IN A COMMON DECLARATION ISSUED OCTOBER 12, POPE JOHN </p><p>PAUL AND PATRIARCH TEOCTIST CALLED FOR CLOSER RELIGIOUS TIES </p><p>AND URGED ROMANIA\'S CHRISTIANS TO SETTLE THEIR DISPUTES </p><p>AMICABLY.  (COMMENT: CATHOLICS IN ROMANIA ARE SEEKING </p><p>RESTITUTION OF PROPERTIES CONFISCATED DURING THE COMMUNIST </p><p>ERA AND HANDED OVER TO ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS. END COMMENT). </p><p>ALSO AT ISSUE ARE CONVERSIONS TO CATHOLICISM AMONG NON- </p><p>BELIEVERS WITH AN ORTHODOX HERITAGE.  THE ORTHODOX CHURCH </p><p>CONSIDERS SUCH NON-BELIEVERS TO BE THEIR NATURAL </p><p>CONSTITUENCY, WHILE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH VIEWS THEM AS OPEN </p><p>TO CONVERSION.  THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN ROMANIA, AS IN </p><p>RUSSIA, HAS MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT LOSING CONSTITUENTS TO </p><p>CATHOLICISM THROUGH SUCH "CONFESSIONAL COMPETITION."  THE </p><p>TWO LEADERS EFFECTIVELY SIDE-STEPPED THIS ISSUE BY CALLING </p><p>FOR COOPERATION RATHER THAN COMPETITION IN THEIR RESPECTIVE </p><p>MISSIONARY WORK AMONG NON-CHRISTIANS.  THE POPE, HOWEVER, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05138  01 OF 02  221043Z </p><p>INSISTED THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SEEKS TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>MISSION OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, WHILE BEING ABLE TO CARRY </p><p>OUT ITS OWN PASTORAL TASK FOR ITS FAITHFUL "AND FOR THOSE </p><p>WHO TURN FREELY TO HER." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>COMMON CONCERNS:  EU ENLARGEMENT AND EVANGELICALS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4.   (U) THE LEADERS WERE IN FULL AGREEMENT ON THE NEED TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT EUROPEAN UNION EXPANSION, WITH ITS SECULAR </p><p>ORIENTATION, IS COMPLEMENTED BY RELIGIOUS VALUES AND </p><p>INCREASING RELIGIOUS UNITY.   TO THIS END, THE POPE AND THE </p><p>PATRIARCH AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET THEIR ISSUES ON THE </p><p>EU\'S AGENDA.  THESE INCLUDE THE SANCTITY OF LIFE, THE </p><p>DIGNITY AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE HUMAN PERSON, JUSTICE </p><p>AND SOLIDARITY, PEACE AND RECONCILIATION, THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>THE FAMILY, AND PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) BOTH LEADERS EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER WHAT THEY </p><p>REGARD AS THE ENCROACHMENT OF "NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS AND </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1657 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  05138  02 OF 02  221043Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    ED-01    UTED-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TEST-00  TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------FC2114  221044Z /38 </p><p>R 220957Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BUCHAREST </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 005138 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EUR/NCE, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SOCI, RO, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: THE POPE AND THE ROMANIAN PATRIARCH: REINFORCING </p><p>BRIDGES TO ORTHODOX EUROPE </p><p> </p><p>SECTS" INTO FORMERLY COMMUNIST STATES. (NOTE: "NEW RELIGIOUS </p><p>MOVEMENTS" IS A VATICAN EUPHEMISM FOR U.S.-BASED PENTECOSTAL </p><p>CHURCHES. END NOTE).  THE POPE AND THE PATRIARCH LAMENTED </p><p>THE FACT THAT THESE COUNTRIES WERE SEEN AS "SPIRITUALLY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05138  02 OF 02  221043Z </p><p>EMPTY," VIRGIN TERRITORY BY THE NEW MOVEMENTS WHEN IN </p><p>REALITY CHRISTIANITY IS MILLENNIA-OLD AND DEEPLY-ROOTED IN </p><p>MOST OF THEM. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU) POPE JOHN PAUL II USED HIS PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP </p><p>WITH ROMANIAN PATRIARCH TEOCTIST, AS HE HAS PREVIOUSLY WITH </p><p>AN ARMENIAN ORTHODOX LEADER, TO BOLSTER ECUMENICAL RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH.  IN THE FACE OF PERCEIVED RUSSIAN </p><p>ORTHODOX INTRANSIGENCE AND INCREASING PRESSURE FROM RUSSIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN RUSSIA, SUCH BRIDGE- </p><p>BUILDING PROVIDES A USEFUL COUNTERPOINT FOR THE POPE TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE THE POSSIBILITIES OF CATHOLIC-ORTHODOX DIALOGUE. </p><p>AS LONG AS THIS POPE REMAINS IN OFFICE, THIS DIALOGUE WILL </p><p>REMAIN A PRIORITY.  IN FACT, THE POPE SUGGESTED THAT THIS </p><p>DIALOGUE BE GIVEN AN INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE THAT WOULD </p><p>PROVIDE FOR A MORE REGULAR ORTHODOX-CATHOLIC EXCHANGE.  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE AND ORTHODOX CHURCHES IN GENERAL VIGOROUSLY PROMOTE </p><p>EUROPE\'S HISTORICALLY CHRISTIAN HERITAGE IN THE CONTEXT OF </p><p>EU EXPANSION TO FORMERLY COMMUNIST STATES.  THE WELCOME </p><p>TEOCTIST RECEIVED IN ROME IS PART OF A BROAD VATICAN </p><p>STRATEGY TO CEMENT ECCLESIASTICAL ALLIANCES TO MATCH THE </p><p>SECULAR ONES CENTERED ON BRUSSELS AND STRASBOURG, AND ALSO </p><p>TO SHOW THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX THEY HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM </p><p>THIS POPE AND FROM CATHOLICISM. </p><p> </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05138  02 OF 02  221043Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA05138 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
