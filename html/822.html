<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 000290 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EAP/PIMBS </p><p>SINGAPORE FOR ARMA </p><p>CINCPAC ALSO FOR FPA - AMB. SALMON </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  4/19/16 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, BX </p><p>SUBJECT:  SULTAN:  BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH THE US "EXCELLENT" </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR THERESA A. TULL. </p><p>REASON:  1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  DURING MY APRIL 16 FAREWELL CALL, </p><p>THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI WAS EFFUSIVE IN EXPRESSING </p><p>HIS SATISFACTION WITH THE "EXCELLENT" STATE OF </p><p>THE US-BRUNEIAN RELATIONSHIP, AND HIGHLY </p><p>COMPLIMENTARY ABOUT WHAT HE PERCEIVES TO BE MY </p><p>ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THIS.  HE NOTED HIS </p><p>PLEASURE AT HIS APEC CONTACTS WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>CLINTON; I SAID I HOPED THAT THE CANCELLED OSAKA </p><p>MEETING COULD BE RESCHEDULED FOR MANILA.  THE </p><p>SULTAN REPEATED HIS APPRECIATION OF THE US </p><p>FORWARD-DEPLOYED PRESENCE IN THE REGION, AND </p><p>INDICATED SOME CONCERN ABOUT RECENT CHINESE </p><p>BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  I THANKED HIS MAJESTY FOR HIS COOPERATION ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN, AND </p><p>ASKED THAT HE CONSIDER AIDING THE BOSNIAN TRAIN </p><p>AND EQUIP EFFORT.  I ALSO THANKED HIM FOR </p><p>SELECTING THE BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER FOR HIS AIR </p><p>FORCE, AND PUT IN A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE </p><p>HARPOON AND SEA SPARROW MISSILE SYSTEMS BEING </p><p>CONSIDERED FOR BRUNEI\'S OFFSHORE PATROL </p><p>VESSELS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>4.  I PAID MY FAREWELL CALL ON SULTAN HASSANAL </p><p>BOLKIAH APRIL 16.  THE SULTAN LAUNCHED OUR </p><p>DISCUSSION BY EXPRESSING HIS COMPLETE </p><p>SATISFACTION WITH WHAT HE TERMED THE "VERY </p><p>EXCELLENT" STATE OF THE US-BRUNEIAN BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  HE SAID THAT THE RELATIONSHIP HAD </p><p>ALWAYS BEEN VERY GOOD, BUT THAT COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES HAD INCREASED </p><p>MARKEDLY, HE THOUGHT, DURING MY TENURE AS </p><p>AMBASSADOR.  HE THANKED ME FOR WHAT HE PERCEIVED </p><p>TO BE MY ROLE IN THIS ACHIEVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>PRAISE FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE SULTAN RECALLED FONDLY HIS PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN THE BLAKE ISLAND APEC LEADERS MEETING, WHERE </p><p>HE HAD FIRST MET PRESIDENT CLINTON.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT HE LIKED VERY MUCH THE PRESIDENT\'S WARM, </p><p>INFORMAL MANNER, AND REMEMBERED THAT THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HAD TOLD HIM THAT THE TWO WERE VERY </p><p>NEARLY THE SAME AGE.  HE SAID HE HAD WELCOMED </p><p>SEEING THE PRESIDENT AGAIN AT THE BOGOR APEC </p><p>MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  I TOLD THE SULTAN THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD </p><p>REGRETTED HAVING TO CANCEL HIS PARTICIPATION AT </p><p>THE OSAKA APEC MEETING, AND HIS PLANNED </p><p>BILATERAL MEETING WITH THE SULTAN, FOR WHICH THE </p><p>LATTER HAD RESCHEDULED HIS TRIP TO OSAKA.  THE </p><p>SULTAN SAID THAT HE COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD THE </p><p>REASON FOR THE THIS.  I TOLD HIM THAT I HOPED </p><p>THAT THE TWO WOULD BE ALBLE TO RESCHEDULE THE </p><p>BILATERAL FOR THE MANILA APEC MEETING, BUT </p><p>CAUTIONED THAT I COULD NOT BE CERTAIN THAT THLS </p><p>COULD BE ARRANGED. </p><p> </p><p>THE US IS A PROTECTIVE PRESENCE IN THE REGION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE SULTAN REPEATED HIS PREVIOUSLY STATED </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE U.S. FORWARD-DEPLOYED </p><p>MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE REGION, WHICH HE SAID </p><p>KEEPS THE REGION STABLE.  HE WELCOMES THE </p><p>PRESENCE OF THE 7TH FLEET IN THE REGION (TWO OF </p><p>WHOSE FRIGATES WILL BE IN BRUNEI APRIL 22-27 FOR </p><p>BILATERAL EXERCISES). </p><p> </p><p>8.  ON CHINA, THE SULTAN SAID THAT THE RECENT </p><p>CHINESE INTIMIDATION OF TAIWAN HAD BEEN A CAUSE </p><p>FOR CONCERN.  HE SAID THAT THE U.S. IS A </p><p>SUPERPOWER, BUT IS WELCOMED AS A HELPFUL </p><p>PRESENCE, IN THE REGION TO PROTECT IT AND </p><p>PROVIDE SECURITY.  CHINA IS SOMETIMES A SOURCE </p><p>OF WORRY TO ITS REGIONAL NEIGHBORS, HE SAID.  HE </p><p>EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT THE U.S. WOULD PROTECT </p><p>TAIWAN IF NEED BE. </p><p> </p><p>COOPERATION ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES, BOSNIA </p><p>TRAIN AND EQUIP </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  I THANKED THE SULTAN FOR HIS HIGH PRAISE OF </p><p>THE STATUS OF THE U.S. RELATIONSHIP, AND CITED </p><p>BRUNEI\'S CONTRIBUTION TO THIS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>CONCLUSION OF THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON </p><p>DEFENSE COOPERATION, AND BRUNEI\'S COOPERATION, </p><p>INCLUDING SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS, </p><p>ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN.  I </p><p>SAID THAT MY GOVERNMENT WAS MOST APPRECIATIVE OF </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT\'S HELP ON KEDO, AID TO THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS, AND ON BOSNIA.  I WELCOMED </p><p>BRUNEI\'S RECENT PLEDGE OF $8 MILLION TO AID </p><p>REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT IN BOSNIA.  I THEN NOTED </p><p>THE CONTINUING NEED FOR FUNDS TO LAUNCH THE </p><p>IMPORTANT BOSNIAN TRAIN AND EQUIP PROGRAM.  I </p><p>SAID THAT I WAS AWARE OF HIS GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>RELUCTANCE TO BREAK WITH TRADITION AND PROVIDE </p><p>MILITARY INSTEAD OF HUMANITARIAN AID, BUT </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THIS UNIQUE SITUATION MIGHT PROVE </p><p>A WORTHWHILE EXCEPTION TO BRUNEI\'S POLICY, AND </p><p>ASKED THAT HE CONSIDER A CONTRIBUTION.  HE WAS </p><p>NONCOMMITTAL BUT SAID HE RECOGNIZED THAT THE </p><p>BOSNIAN MUSLIMS NEEDED HELP IN THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>MILITARY SALES EFFORTS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  I THANKED THE SULTAN FOR SELECTING </p><p>SIKORSKY\'S BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER FOR HIS AIR </p><p>FORCE.  HE SAID THAT THE BLACKHAWK WAS POWERFUL, </p><p>HE LIKED FLYING HIS, AND HIS AIR FORCE HAD </p><p>WANTED IT.  I THEN MENTIONED THAT TWO U.S. </p><p>MISSILES WERE IN THE RUNNING FOR PLACEMENT, IN </p><p>SEPARATE SYSTEMS, ON BRUNEI\'S OFFSHORE PATROL </p><p>VESSELS, THE HARPOON AND THE SEA SPARROW.  IN A </p><p>VERY LOW-KEY FASHION, I EXPRESSED THE BELIEF </p><p>THAT THESE BIDDERS WOULD RECEIVE A FAIR HEARING, </p><p>AND THE HOPE THAT THE SYSTEMS WOULD BE </p><p>SELECTED.  THE SULTAN WAS NONCOMMITTAL, SAYING </p><p>ONLY THAT A COMMITTEE WAS REVIEWING THESE BIDS </p><p>AND HE HAD NOT YET RECEIVED A RECOMMENDATION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE SULTAN WAS OBVIOUSLY SINCERE IN HIS </p><p>SATISFACTION WITH THE STATE OF THE BILATERAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP, HIS ADMIRATION FOR PRESIDENT </p><p>CLINTON, AND IN HIS CONTINUING APPRECIATION FOR </p><p>THE POSITIVE ROLE THE U.S. MILITARY PLAYS IN THE </p><p>ASIA PACIFIC REGION.  HIS APPRECIATION LIKELY </p><p>HAS BEEN HEIGHTENED BY HIS ACKNOWLEDGED CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT CHINA\'S RECENT BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>12.  CONCERN ABOUT CHINA AND APPRECIATION FOR </p><p>THE U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE REGION ARE </p><p>THEMES WHICH HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN SEVERAL OF </p><p>MY FAREWELL CALL DISCUSSIONS WITH SENIOR </p><p>OFFICIALS.  THE APRIL 22-27 BILATERAL NAVAL </p><p>EXERCISES HERE WITH TWO FRIGATES OF THE 7TH </p><p>FLEET ARE WELL-TIMED TO PROVIDE WELCOME PHYSICAL </p><p>EVIDENCE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE.  THE BRUNEIANS </p><p>ARE COOPERATING WHOLEHEARTEDLY IN THE WEEK\'S </p><p>PROGRAM, NOT ONLY IN THE ACTUAL EXERCISES </p><p>THEMSELVES, BUT IN HOUSING, FEEDING, AND </p><p>TRANSPORTING A SMALL 7TH FLEET BAND WHICH WILL </p><p>PERFORM SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE SHIPS\' STAY. </p><p>THIS UNPREDECENTED LEVEL OF COOPERATION MAY HAVE </p><p>BEEN TRIGGERED IN PART BY UNEASE OVER CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>13.  WE SHOULD NOT TAKE BRUNEI\'S COOPERATION </p><p>WITH THE U.S. ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES FOR </p><p>GRANTED.  THE PERSONAL TOUCH IS MOST IMPORTANT, </p><p>AND THE SULTAN\'S SENSE OF PERSONAL RAPPORT WITH </p><p>THE PRESIDENT IS GENUINE.  THE DECISION LAST </p><p>YEAR TO SEEK A BILATERAL MEETING BETWEEN THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND THE SULTAN DURING THE APEC </p><p>LEADERS\' MEETING, TO THANK HIM FOR THIS </p><p>COOPERATION, WAS A WISE ONE.  I RECOMMEND THAT </p><p>THE BILATERAL MEETING BE RESCHEDULED FOR THE </p><p>PHILIPPINES\' APEC MEETINGS.  IT IS NOT ONLY THE </p><p>POLITE THING TO DO, BUT IT COULD PAY DIVIDENDS </p><p>IN TERMS OF FUTURE COOPERATION AND CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>TO INTERNATIONAL CAUSES SUPPORTED BY THE U.S. </p><p>END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TULL </p><p></p></div>
