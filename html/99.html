<p>S E C R E T  STATE 371963 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TERREP EXCLUSIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER </p><p>SUBJECT:  ABU NIDAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET -ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF AN ANALYSIS OF THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THE ABU NIDAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION </p><p>PREPARED BY THE US INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY: </p><p> </p><p>ABU NIDAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND: </p><p> </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL GROUP IS AMONG THE MOST DANGEROUS AND </p><p>RUTHLESS OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p>IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST ORGANIZED AND MOST EFFECTIVE OF </p><p>THE RADICAL PALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUPS, CAREFULLY </p><p>PLANNING ITS OPERATIONS AND KEEPING ITS INFORMATION </p><p>TIGHTLY COMPARTMENTED.  FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION HAS CONCENTRATED ON JORDANIAN AND PRO-ARAFAT </p><p>PLO TARGETS, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IT IS AGAIN </p><p>BROADENING ITS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION HAS A NUMBER OF COVER NAMES INCLUDING </p><p>BLACK JUNE, NO LONGER USED, AND THE FATAH REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>COUNCIL.  MORE RECENTLY, IT HAS BEGUN USING THE NAME ARAB </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY BRIGADES WHEN STAGING ATTACKS AGAINST GULF </p><p>TARGETS AND EGYPT.  IT ALSO CALLS ITSELF BLACK SEPTEMBER </p><p>IN ATTACKS AGAINST JORDANIAN AND PALESTINIAN TARGETS, AND </p><p>THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF SOCIALIST MUSLIMS </p><p>(ROSM) IN ATTACKS AGAINST BRITISH TARGETS. </p><p> </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL GROUP WAS FORMED IN 1974 FROM ELEMENTS </p><p>WHICH BROKE AWAY FROM ARAFAT\'S FATAH ORGANIZATION AFTER </p><p>HE ANNOUNCED A BAN ON PLO INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM OUTSIDE ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. </p><p>THE GROUP IS HEADED BY SABRI AL-BANNA WHO GOES BY THE </p><p>NAME OF ABU NIDAL.  UNLIKE MANY TERRORIST GROUPS, </p><p>HOWEVER, IT IS SO WELL ORGANIZED, THAT IT CAN FUNCTION </p><p>WITH OR WITHOUT ITS LEADER.  INDEED, BEFORE A NOVEMBER </p><p>19, L985 INTERVIEW FROM LIBYA, ABU NIDAL WAS WIDELY </p><p>RUMORED TO BE DEAD.  THE ABU NIDAL GROUP ALSO APPEARS TO </p><p>BE LESS DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE FINANCING THAN OTHER GROUPS, </p><p>IN PART BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE INCOME ON ITS </p><p>OWN. </p><p> </p><p>THE GROUP IS COMMITTED TO THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO DESTROY </p><p>DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO RECONCILE ISRAEL AND THE ARAB </p><p>STATES.  IT ALSO CALLS FOR THE OVERTHROW OF ALL </p><p>CONSERVATIVE AND MODERATE ARAB REGIMES AS WELL AS FOR THE </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF MODERATE ELEMENTS IN THE PLO, NOTABLY </p><p>ARAFAT\'S FATAH ORGANIZATION.  IT CONTENDS THAT BOTH </p><p>INTER-ARAB AND INTRA-PALESTINIAN TERRORISM ARE NEEDED TO </p><p>CREATE AN ALL EMBRACING ARAB REVOLUTION WHICH WILL IN </p><p>TURN LIBERATE PALESTINE.  TO FURTHER ITS REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>AIMS, IT WILL ALSO STRIKE AT EUROPEAN AND OTHER TARGETS </p><p>IF IT BELIEVES THAT THERE IS ANY TACTICAL ADVANTAGE IN </p><p>DOING SO. </p><p> </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN THE ORGANIZATION PROBABLY NUMBERS SEVERAL </p><p>HUNDRED.  IT HAS CELLS THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST, SOUTH </p><p>ASIA AND EUROPE.  OPERATIONAL GROUPS ARE SMALL, NUMBERING </p><p>ONE TO THREE, EACH WITH GOOD OPERATIONAL SECURITY AND </p><p>GOOD COMPARTMENTALIZATION.  OPERATIONS ARE SUPPORTED BY </p><p>CAREFULLY COLLECTED, ON-TARGET INTELLIGENCE.  THE ABU </p><p>NIDAL ORGANIZATION ALSO MAKES USE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF </p><p>PALESTINIAN STUDENTS STUDYING ABROAD, SOMETIMES INVOLVING </p><p>THEM IN OPERATIONS AFTER ONLY PERFUNCTORY TRAINING. </p><p> </p><p>LINKAGES TO OTHER GROUPS AND STATES: </p><p> </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL GROUP IS IN MANY WAYS A ROGUE </p><p>ORGANIZATION.  WHILE MAINTAINING ITS RADICAL PALESTINIAN </p><p>OUTLOOK, IT HAS LINKED UP WITH VARIOUS ARAB PATRONS, </p><p>PRESUMABLY FOR FINANCIAL AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AS MUCH </p><p>AS, IF NOT MORE THAN, FOR IDEOLOGICAL AFFINITY. </p><p> </p><p>WHEN FIRST ORGANIZED, THE GROUP CAME UNDER THE PATRONAGE </p><p>OF IRAQ.  WHEN SADDAM HUSAYN FINALLY EXPELLED ABU NIDAL </p><p>AND THE REMNANTS OF HIS GROUP IN MID-1983, HE MOVED TO </p><p>SYRIA.  SINCE THEN, THE ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTING </p><p>OPERATIONS AGAINST JORDAN, MODERATE PALESTINIANS AND </p><p>ARAFAT\'S MAINLINE PLO, PRESUMABLY WITH THE SUPPORT AND </p><p>COOPERATION OF SYRIAN INTELLIGENCE. </p><p> </p><p>IN RECENT MONTHS, ABU NIDAL HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF BECOMING </p><p>MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH QADHAFI. THOUGH THE GROUP STILL </p><p>MAINTAINS A HEADQUARTERS IN DAMASCUS (AND POSSIBLY ONE IN </p><p>THE BIQA\'\'VALLEY), ABU NIDAL HIMSELF IS APPARENTLY </p><p>CURRENTLY RESIDING IN LIBYA.  HE HAS GRANTED SEVERAL </p><p>INTERVIEWS FROM LIBYA AND HAS SPOKEN HIGHLY OF QADHAFI IN </p><p>THEM. </p><p> </p><p>LINKAGE BETWEEN THE ABU NIDAL GROUP AND OTHER TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN.  THE GROUP IS VERY </p><p>TIGHTLY ORGANIZED AND CONTROLLED AND, FOR SECURITY </p><p>REASONS, DOES NOT APPEAR TO COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH OTHER </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS.  THIS DOES NOT RULE OUT NON-OPERATIONAL </p><p>COOPERATION WHEN THE GROUP BELIEVES THERE IS SUFFICIENT </p><p>TACTICAL ADVANTAGE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT HAS ADMITTED IN AN </p><p>INTERVIEW TO GROWING COOPERATION WITH EUROPEAN </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE IRA. </p><p> </p><p>CURRENT OPERATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL GROUP HAS REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED ITS </p><p>ABILITY TO OPERATE IN ANY COUNTRY IT CHOOSES AND HAS </p><p>SHOWN NO SIGNS OF ESCHEWING OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE, PARTICULARLY IN ITS </p><p>ANTI-ARAFAT OPERATIONS.  THE ORGANIZATION HAS STAGED </p><p>ATTACKS IN 18 COUNTRIES ON THREE CONTINENTS, AND HAS </p><p>CONDUCTED OVER 60 TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE LAST EIGHT </p><p>YEARS, 30 SINCE 1984 AND 11 SINCE JULY OF THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>IN RECENT INTERVIEWS, NOTABLY ONE IN DER SPIEGEL, LAST </p><p>MONTH, ABU NIDAL HIMSELF HAS MADE THREATS AGAINST MANY </p><p>COUNTRIES AND WORLD LEADERS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUBARAK, </p><p>PRIME MINISTER THATCHER AND PRESIDENT REAGAN.  HIS </p><p>TIRADES AGAINST JEWS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY VIRULENT. </p><p>ESPECIALLY SINCE 1984, ABU NIDAL HAS CONCENTRATED ON </p><p>JORDANIANS AND PRO-ARAFAT PLO OFFICIALS.  THESE ATTACKS </p><p>WERE PROVOKED IN LARGE MEASURE BY THE JORDANIAN AGREEMENT </p><p>TO HOST THE PNC MEETING IN NOVEMBER 1984 AND BY KING </p><p>HUSSEIN\'S FEBRUARY ACCORD WITH ARAFAT TO RESTART THE </p><p>ARAB-ISRAELI PEACE PROCESS.  THE ATTACKS ON JORDANIANS IN </p><p>1985 HAVE INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>-- NOVEMBER 24 ASSASSINATION OF A PALESTINIAN IN AMMAN BY </p><p>THREE ABU NIDAL AGENTS. </p><p> </p><p>- THE MURDER OF A JORDANIAN PUBLISHER IN ATHENS IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>-- A PLOT TO ASSASSINATE THE JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>GREECE BY A PALESTINIAN ARRESTED BY GREEK POLICE IN </p><p>AUGUST. </p><p> </p><p>-- AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT ON </p><p>AUGUST 5, BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN INITIATED BY ABU NIDAL. </p><p> </p><p>- THE MURDER OF A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT IN TURKEY ON </p><p>JULY 24. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON JULY 1, A BOMB EXPLODED AT THE BRITISH AIR TICKET </p><p>OFFICE IN MADRID ALSO DAMAGING THE TWA OFFICE UPSTAIRS. </p><p>NEARBY, THE JORDANIAN AIRLINE OFFICE WAS HIT BY AUTOMATIC </p><p>WEAPONS FIRE AND TWO GRENADES WHICH DID NOT EXPLODE.  IN </p><p>ALL, ONE WAS KILLED AND 24 WERE WOUNDED. </p><p> </p><p>-- AMAN CLAIMING TO BE WITH BLACK SEPTEMBER FIRED A </p><p>ROCKET AT THE JORDANIAN EMBASSY IN ROME IN </p><p>APRIL. </p><p> </p><p>-- AN ABU NIDAL ROCKET ATTACK ON A JORDANIAN AIRLINER </p><p>TAKING OFF FROM ATHENS IN APRIL.  THE ROCKET HIT THE </p><p>PLANE BUT DID NOT EXPLODE. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN DECEMBER, THE JORDANIAN DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION IN </p><p>BUCHAREST WAS KILLED GETTING INTO HIS CAR. </p><p> </p><p>THE GROUP HAS ALSO TARGETED BRITISH INTERESTS.  ROSM </p><p>CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MARCH 1985 KIDNAPPING OF A </p><p>BRITISH JOURNALIST IN LEBANON AND THE ASSASSINATION OF </p><p>BRITISH DIPLOMATS IN INDIA AND GREECE IN 1984.  THE </p><p>PURPOSE OF THESE ATTACKS IS PROBABLY TO FORCE THE UK TO </p><p>RELEASE ABU NIDAL MEMBERS IMPRISONED FOR THE ATTEMPTED </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR IN LONDON IN JUNE </p><p>1982. </p><p> </p><p>BASED ON THE STYLE OF ABU NIDAL ATTACKS, IT IS EVIDENT </p><p> </p><p>THAT THE GROUP IS WILLING TO CAUSE INDISCRIMINATE </p><p>CASUALTIES.  APART FROM THE ASSASSINATION OF PARTICULAR </p><p>INDIVIDUALS, ABU NIDAL OPERATIONS IN 1985 RESULTED IN </p><p>NINE DEATHS AND 201 WOUNDED AMONG INNOCENT BYSTANDERS NOT </p><p>COUNTING THE VICTIMS IN THE EGYPT AIR TRAGEDY.  HAD THE </p><p>JORDANIAN AIRLINER HIT BY AN ABU NIDAL ROCKET TAKING OFF </p><p>FROM ATHENS AIRPORT CRASHED, THE NUMBER COULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>MUCH HIGHER.  IN 1983, 111 DIED IN THE CRASH OF A GULF </p><p>AIRLINES JET ON WHICH AN ABU NIDAL BOMB EXPLODED.  TWO </p><p>THIRDS OF THE GROUP\'S 19 ATTACKS THIS YEAR HAVE TAKEN </p><p>PLACE IN WESTERN EUROPE.  EUROPEAN CITIZENS HAVE </p><p>INCREASINGLY BECOME CASUALTIES AND INTERESTS OF EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES ARE INCREASINGLY DAMAGED BY THESE ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THE GROUP\'S ABILITY TO MOVE AT WILL IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES </p><p>THEIR ACTIVITIES HARDER TO TRACE.  TO FACILITATE TRAVEL, </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION HAS A RECORD OF USING MOROCCAN AND OTHER </p><p>NORTH AFRICAN TRAVEL DOCUMENTS INCLUDING THOSE PRODUCED </p><p>BY ITS OWN FORGING OPERATION.  SOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA HAVE BEEN MORE PERMISSIVE THAN OTHERS IN </p><p>ALLOWING ABU NIDAL MEMBERS FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, </p><p>APPARENTLY HOPING THAT THIS WILL BUY THEM A MODICUM OF </p><p>IMMUNITY FROM TERRORIST ACTS.  THERE IS GROWING </p><p>RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS A DUBIOUS ASSUMPTION. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, TAKING LEGAL ACTION IS SOMETIMES </p><p>DIFFICULT.  IN OCTOBER, AN ALLEGED HIGH RANKING ABU NIDAL </p><p>FIGURE USING SPAIN AS A BASE WAS ACQUITTED BY A SPANISH </p><p>COURT OF BEING A MEMBER OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>AMONG THE ATTACKS INVOLVING INNOCENT BYSTANDERS ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE NOVEMBER 23 EGYPT AIR HIJACKING TO MALTA WHICH </p><p>TOOK 60 LIVES.  THE ARAB REVOLUTIONARY BRIGADES, A COVER </p><p>NAME FOR ABU NIDAL, CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE HIJACKING, AND </p><p>THERE IS CORROBORATING EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS AN ABU NIDAL </p><p>OPERATION.  THE ACT ALSO BORE THE SIGNATURE OF THE ABU </p><p>NIDAL GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT ARRESTED IN NOVEMBER A 12-MAN </p><p>TEAM OF ABU NIDAL TERRORISTS INTENDING TO ATTACK THE </p><p>ISRAELI CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON SEPTEMBER 30, A BOMB EXPLODED NEAR THE EL AL OFFICE </p><p>IN AMSTERDAM, CLAIMED BY ABU NIDAL (FATAH REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>COUNCIL). </p><p> </p><p>-- ABU NIDAL BOMBED THE BRITISH AIR OFFICE IN ROME IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER INJURING 15 PERSONS, MANY OF THEM PASSERSBY. </p><p> </p><p>-- BRITAIN ARRESTED TWO ABU NIDAL OPERATIVES IN SEPTEMBER </p><p>WHO INTENDED TO ATTACK AN UNIDENTIFIED TARGET. </p><p>-- ABU NIDAL MEMBERS THREW GRENADES AT ROME\'S CAFE DE </p><p>PARIS IN SEPTEMBER, INJURING 38 TOURISTS, AMONG THEM </p><p>GERMANS, BRITONS, ITALIANS, ARGENTINIANS, BRAZILIANS AND </p><p>AMERICANS. </p><p> </p><p>--  A JULY INCIDENT IN COPENHAGEN INVOLVING A SYNAGOGUE </p><p>AND THE NORTHWEST ORIENT AIRLINES OFFICE, AND ONE IN </p><p>AMSTERDAM ON SEPTEMBER 30 INVOLVING THE EL AL OFFICE HAVE </p><p>NOT BEEN DIRECTLY TIED TO ANY GROUP, BUT THERE IS </p><p>SUSPICION THAT ABU NIDAL WAS INVOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE GROUP BOMBED TWO HOTELS IN ATHENS, ONE IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER WHICH INJURED 19 PERSONS, MOSTLY BRITISH, AND </p><p>ONE IN AUGUST, WHICH INJURED 13 BRITISH. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE BOMBING OF TWO RESTAURANTS IN KUWAIT IN JULY, MOST </p><p>PROBABLY BY ABU NIDAL, KILLED EIGHT PERSONS AND INJURING </p><p>89 OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ATTACKS ON THE AIRLINE OFFICES IN MADRID KILLING </p><p>ONE AND WOUNDING 24. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ROCKET AGAINST A JORDANIAN AIRILNER IN APRIL. </p><p> </p><p>FUTURE TRENDS AND IMPLICATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO </p><p>CONCENTRATE ON JORDANIAN AND PRO-ARAFAT PLO TARGETS. </p><p>EVEN IF THE SYRIANS FOR TACTICAL REASONS SHOULD CURTAIL </p><p>THEIR SUPPORT OF THE ABU NIDAL GROUP\'S OPERATIONS AGAINST </p><p>JORDAN AND PRO-ARAFAT PLO, THE ACTIVITIES ARE LIKELY TO </p><p>CONTINUE.  ABU NIDAL HIMSELF, UNDER DEATH SENTENCE BY THE </p><p>PLO SINCE 1974 FOR PLOTTING AGAINST THE LIFE OF ARAFAT, </p><p>AND THOSE UNDER HIM ARE CARRYING ON WHAT AMOUNTS TO A </p><p>PERSONAL VENDETTA.  THE ADDITION OF LIBYAN SUPPORT </p><p>PRESENTS AN EVEN BROADER THREAT, PARTICULARLY FOR WESTERN </p><p>STATES.  QADHAFI\'S PARANOIA AGAINST THE WEST AND ABU </p><p>NIDAL\'S EFFICIENCY COMPRISE A DEADLY COMBINATION. </p><p>INCREASINGLY, HIGH CASUALTY ATTACKS AGAINST WESTERN </p><p>TARGETS ARE LIKELY. </p><p> </p><p>IN THE LONGER RUN, THE ABU NIDAL GROUP, DUE TO ITS </p><p>EXCELLENT ORGANIZATION, ACCESS TO FUNDS AND SUPPORT, MOST </p><p>RECENTLY FROM LIBYA, AND DEDICATION TO TERRORISM, </p><p>CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS.  ITS WIDE-SPREAD NETWORK AND RUTHLESS </p><p>DISREGARD FOR THE INTERESTS AND IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS OF </p><p>THE COUNTRIES, GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS IT STRIKES, MAKES </p><p>IT A FORMIDABLE FOE.  ONLY THROUGH A COORDINATED EFFORT </p><p>OF ALL THOSE COUNTRIES FOR WHICH IT POSES A POTENTIAL </p><p>THREAT CAN THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION BE STOPPED. </p><p> </p><p>ANNEX: </p><p> </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ABU NIDAL INCIDENTS, 1978-1985 </p><p> </p><p>1985 </p><p> </p><p>23-27 NOVEMBER </p><p>MALTA:  EGYPT AIR FLIGHT 648 WAS HIJACKED </p><p>FROM ATHENS TO MALTA RESULTING IN THE </p><p>LOSS OF 59 LIVES. </p><p> </p><p>14 NOVEMBER </p><p> </p><p>AMMAN:  ASSASSINATION OF A PALESTINIAN, </p><p>HUSSEIN AL-BITAR.
