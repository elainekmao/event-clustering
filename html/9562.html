<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001862 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, PHUM, KDEM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: SUPREME COURT SUSPENDS REGISTRATION OF RIOS MONTT </p><p>CANDIDACY; OPPOSITION RALLY STRENGTHENS BERGER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 1805 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 1774 </p><p>     C. GUATEMALA 1760 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On July 20, the Supreme Court accepted two appeals </p><p>filed by opposition political parties against the </p><p>presidential candidacy of former General Efrain Rios Montt, </p><p>and suspended registration of the candidate until the court </p><p>hears the appeal.  The President of the Supreme Court </p><p>immediately recused himself and the other members of the </p><p>Supreme Court from hearing the case, based on the fact that </p><p>they had already stated their position on the matter in their </p><p>earlier vote (reftels).  A "special" Supreme Court was </p><p>appointed to hear the case, made up of the 13 appeals court </p><p>magistrates.  Some accounts say that this court could rule on </p><p>the appeals as early as this week. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Jorge Arevalo, FRG Congressman and spokesman for the </p><p>Rios Montt presidential campaign, called the Supreme Court\'s </p><p>decision "madness," saying that Guatemalan law does not allow </p><p>for an appeal to a decision of the Constitutional Court.  If </p><p>the newly conformed "special" Supreme Court were to uphold </p><p>the appeal, however, we understand the FRG could once again </p><p>appeal its decision to the Constitutional Court, which just </p><p>ruled in favor of Rios Montt\'s candidacy.  By accepting the </p><p>appeal in the first place, the Supreme Court challenged the </p><p>constitutional (and conventional) wisdom that the </p><p>Constitutional Court is the last court of appeals on </p><p>constitutional matters. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Earlier on July 20, GANA coalition presidential </p><p>candidate Oscar Berger held a rally in the main square of </p><p>Guatemala City to protest the Constitutional Court\'s </p><p>decision.  CNN estimated that 3,000 people, all dressed in </p><p>black, attended the rally.  While the demonstration did not </p><p>draw in the 10,000 people expected by organizers, it gave </p><p>Berger the support of many civil society and center-left </p><p>political leaders, who joined him on the stage to denounce </p><p>the latest action of the FRG.  The symbolism of the July 20 </p><p>rally -- with the diverse opposition groups so disgusted with </p><p>the FRG that they were prepared to embrace the center-right </p><p>Berger publicly -- sent the signal to Guatemalan voters that </p><p>the best way to defeat the FRG in the coming election is to </p><p>swallow their differences and throw their lot behind the </p><p>candidate with the best chance of defeating the FRG. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment:  The facts and motives behind the Supreme </p><p>Court\'s decision to accept the two appeals against Rios </p><p>Montt\'s candidacy are not all clear yet.  But they create an </p><p>unfortunate perception that the Supreme Court, like the </p><p>Constitutional Court, is not above partisan preferences.  Its </p><p>tacit, if not explicit, disavowal of the Constitutional </p><p>Court\'s role as court of last instance creates a </p><p>constitutional challenge which could have broader </p><p>implications.  We recommend press guidance that steers us </p><p>clear of this issue, i.e. that this is an issue for </p><p>Guatemalan institutions to decide. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
