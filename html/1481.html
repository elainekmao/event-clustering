IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A. HARARE 00246, B. HARARE 00106 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) ON JANUARY 17, THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT, ANTHONY GUBBAY, PUBLICLY REPRIMANDED THE JUDGE </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE HIGH COURT, GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU, FOR </p><p>ATTACKING GUBBAY HIMSELF, THE SUPREME COURT, AND OTHER </p><p>JUDGES OF THE HIGH COURT FOR RULING AGAINST THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ON THE ISSUE OF LAND. </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU ASSAILED THE SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>WHILE SPEAKING AT THE OPENING OF THE JUDICIAL YEAR IN </p><p>THE BULAWAYO HIGH COURT ON JANUARY 8 (REF A).  GUBBAY </p><p>REJECTED CHIDYAUSIKU\'S CONTENTION THAT THE COURTS HAVE </p><p>NO BUSINESS RULING ON THE GOZ\'S "FAST-TRACK" </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PLAN BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL, NOT A </p><p>LEGAL, ISSUE.  "SUCH AN ATTITUDE," GUBBAY SAID, </p><p>"CONFLICTS WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND HIS OATH OF OFFICE." </p><p>GUBBAY ALSO DISMISSED A CONCERN EXPRESSED BY CHIDYAUSIKU </p><p>THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAD OVERTURNED ONE OF HIS </p><p>DECISIONS, POINTING OUT SIMPLY THAT EVEN A LAYMAN </p><p>UNDERSTANDS THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO </p><p>REVERSE THE RULINGS OF HIGH COURT JUDGES. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) GUBBAY\'S STATEMENT FINISHED WITH THE DECLARATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00354  181611Z </p><p>THAT "AFTER ANXIOUS CONSIDERATION, I AM OF THE VIEW THAT </p><p>THE JUDGE PRESIDENT\'S CONDUCT DOES NOT YET </p><p>WARRANT...ADVICE TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT, THAT </p><p>HIS REMOVAL OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATED.  NONETHELESS IT IS </p><p>DESERVING OF A SEVERE REPRIMAND."  GUBBAY ADDED FURTHER </p><p>THAT "IN THE TENSE SITUATION PREVAILING IN ZIMBABWE AT </p><p>PRESENT, THE JUDGE PRESIDENT SHOULD AVOID MAKING </p><p>INFLAMMATORY STATEMENTS."  HE CONCLUDED WITH THE COMMENT </p><p>THAT THE SUPREME COURT BENCH FULLY SUPPORTED THE </p><p>ISSUANCE OF HIS STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: THIS WAS AN UNUSUAL PUBLIC EXCHANGE OF </p><p>RHETORICAL VOLLEYS BETWEEN TWO SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>BENCH.  GUBBAY\'S COMMENTS REFLECT ANGER WITH </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU\'S OUTRAGEOUS ATTACK ON THE LEGITIMATE ROLE </p><p>OF THE COURTS, AND ARE, MORE GENERALLY, A RESPONSE TO </p><p>THE INCREASING EXECUTIVE BRANCH CRITICISM OF THE </p><p>JUDICIARY AND ITS INDEPENDENCE.  CHIDYAUSIKU HAS MADE IT </p><p>CLEAR THAT HE IS WILLING TO CARRY ZANU-PF\'S WATER AND A </p><p>NUMBER OF LEGAL OBSERVERS HAVE TOLD US MUGABE WANTS TO </p><p>REPLACE GUBBAY WITH CHIDYAUSIKU WHEN THE FORMER RETIRES </p><p>IN APRIL 2002.  ONE PROMINENT JUDGE TOLD US </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU\'S SPEECH WAS INTENDED AS A TRAP TO FORCE </p><p>GUBBAY TO CALL FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF THE HIGH COURT </p><p>JUDGE PRESIDENT.  ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACT, SUCH A CALL </p><p>COULD HAVE GIVEN PRESIDENT MUGABE A CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>PROVISION TO USE TO REPLACE GUBBAY NOW WITH CHIDYAUSIKU, </p><p>IN THE NAME OF JUDICIAL HARMONY.  GUBBAY AVOIDED THE </p><p>TRAP BY REPRIMANDING CHIDYAUSIKU INSTEAD OF CALLING FOR </p><p>AN INVESTIGATION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00354  181611Z </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
