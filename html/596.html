<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 00593 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINR, SOCI, PGOV, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: MY BROTHER\'S A MUJAHID, CONFESSES A SAUDI BANKER </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY: AN OTHERWISE CALM SENIOR BANKER RECENTLY </p><p>REVEALED TO US THAT HIS BROTHER HAD FOUGHT WITH THE </p><p>MUJAHIDEEN IN AFGHANISTAN.  HIS ACCOUNT ILLUSTRATES THE </p><p>DIFFERENT VIEWS OF ISLAM AND SOCIETY THAT EXIST IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA, EVEN WITHIN FAMILIES - - DIFFERENCES THAT </p><p>GO FAR BEYOND THE COMMONPLACE ISSUES OF THE ROLE OF THE </p><p>MUTAWWA\'IN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE CHARGE RECENTLY TALKED TO A PROMINENT BANK </p><p>PRESIDENT AND FORMER FINANCE MINISTRY OFFICIAL.  DURING </p><p>THE DISCUSSION, THIS SOBER-MINDED PERSON REVEALED THAT </p><p>HIS BROTHER FOUGHT WITH THE MUJAHIDEEN FOR FOUR MONTHS </p><p>IN AFGHANISTAN IN 1991.  AS AN EXPLANATION, HE </p><p>DESCRIBED HIS BROTHER AS A 19 YEAR OLD KID WHO HAD NOT </p><p>FINISHED SCHOOL AND WHO WAS BORED WITH HIS EXISTENCE IN </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA.  FOR HIM, FIGHTING FOR ISLAM IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN WAS AN EXCITING ALTERNATIVE, A WAY TO </p><p>EXPRESS HIS DEEP PERSONAL RELIGIOUS FAITH. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE BANKER DID NOT VOLUNTEER ANY DETAILS OF HIS </p><p>BROTHER\'S STAY IN AFGHANISTAN, BUT INSTEAD SKIPPED </p><p>AHEAD TO THE POINT OF HIS RETURN.  WHEN THE BROTHER </p><p>CAME BACK AFTER HIS JAUNT, THE FAMILY WAS WORRIED "THAT </p><p>HE MIGHT GET INTO TROUBLE."  SO, THE FAMILY QUICKLY </p><p>ARRANGED A MARRIAGE - - "TOOK CARE OF THAT RIGHT </p><p>AWAY".  GRATEFUL FOR SMALL FAVORS, THE BANKER WAS HAPPY </p><p>TO REPORT THAT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER HAS NOT EXPRESSED </p><p>ANY DESIRE TO GO FIGHT IN BOSNIA. </p><p> </p><p>5. SINCE HIS RETURN, AND CONTRARY TO THE FAMILY\'S </p><p>EXPECTATION, THE BROTHER HAS DECLINED TO LIVE WITH HIS </p><p>MOTHER, WHO LIVES ALONE IN RIYADH.  INSTEAD, HE DECIDED </p><p>TO MOVE TO DAMMAM.  OUR CONTACT EXPRESSED THE FEAR THAT </p><p>HIS BROTHER IS TRYING TO SEVER HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>THE REST OF THE FAMILY.  THE BANKER SAID HIS BROTHER, </p><p>ALTHOUGH POLITE, AVOIDS TALKING TO HIM BECAUSE HE IS A </p><p>BANKER, A VOCATION THAT THE BROTHER FINDS DISTASTEFUL. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE BANKER SAID THAT, DESPITE THE INFLUENCE OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES SUCH AS HIS BROTHER, SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA IS A STABLE COUNTRY, IN LITTLE DANGER OF GOING </p><p>THE WAY OF IRAN OR ALGERIA.  HE CONTINUED THAT, UNLIKE </p><p>IN SUDAN AND IRAN, THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA DOES NOT SUPPORT THE EXTREMISTS.  HERE, PEOPLE </p><p>RECOGNIZE THAT THE EXTREMISTS ARE ONLY GRABBING FOR </p><p>POWER, NOT RELIGION.  THE BANKER SAID THAT EXTREMISTS </p><p>WERE MORE LIKELY TO BRING ABOUT CHAOS THAN SUCCESS </p><p>THROUGH THEIR ECONOMIC PROGRAMS, AS SHOWN IN SUDAN AND </p><p>IRAN.  THERE, EXTREMISTS DID NOT FIX ECONOMIES - THEY </p><p>RUINED THEM. </p><p> </p><p>7. IN SAUDI ARABIA, THE KING HOLDS ALL THE CARDS, AND </p><p>IS ABLE TO TONE DOWN OR QUASH SUCH DISSENT AT ANY </p><p>TIME.  THE BANKER SAID THAT THE KING DID PRECISELY THAT </p><p>A FEW YEARS AGO, WITH RAPID SUCCESS.  THE DANGER, HE </p><p>SAID, WAS NOT THAT EXTREMISTS WOULD TOPPLE THE SAG WITH </p><p>FORCE.  RATHER THE DANGER IS THAT, BY FORCEFULLY </p><p>CHALLENGING THE SAG, THE EXTREMISTS WILL RISK TEARING </p><p>THE FABRIC OF SAUDI SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>8. THE BANKER DID CONCEDE THAT SOME BUSINESSMEN DO </p><p>STAND OUT FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR ISLAMIC GROUPS, CITING </p><p>THE EXAMPLE OF USAMA BIN LADEN.  ALTHOUGH MOST KNOWN </p><p>FOR HIS FUNDING OF MUJAHIDEEN GROUPS IN AFGHANISTAN, </p><p>BIN LADEN HAS GIVEN MONEY TO SEVERAL ISLAMIC CAUSES </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THE BANKER SAID BIN LADEN IS AN </p><p>EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF MOST BUSINESSMEN </p><p>IN SAUDI ARABIA.  MOST, HE REPEATED, DO NOT SUPPORT THE </p><p>GOALS OF EXTREMISTS. </p><p> </p><p>9. COMMENT: THIS GENTLEMAN HAS OBVIOUSLY GIVEN THE </p><p>DIFFICULT PROBLEM OF EXTREMISM IN SAUDI ARABIA SOME </p><p>THOUGHT.  HAVING A TRUE BELIEVER WILLING TO FIGHT FOR </p><p>ISLAM FOR A BROTHER HAS GIVEN HIM GOOD REASON.  OTHER </p><p>SAUDI BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT FIGURES HAVE MADE SIMILAR </p><p>COMMENTS ON EXTREMISTS AND THE STABILITY OF SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA, AND WE ASSUME SOME FACE THE SAME FAMILIAL </p><p>DIVIDE.  AT PRESENT, THEIR JUDGEMENTS THAT THE KINGDOM </p><p>IS STABLE SEEM CORRECT, BUT THE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION </p><p>IN THEIR OWN FAMILIES ILLUSTRATES THE DEPTH OF THE </p><p>DISAGREEMENTS OVER THE PROPER ROLE OF ISLAM IN SAUDI </p><p>SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>10. FOR MANY OF OUR BANKER FRIEND\'S GENERATION, IT IS </p><p>NOT THE ISLAMIC CONTENT OF THE THOUGHT OF THEIR YOUNGER </p><p>BROTHERS (AND SONS) THAT SCARES THEM.  SOCIALLY, THEY </p><p>ARE, BY AND LARGE, A VERY CONSERVATIVE, DEVOUT LOT </p><p>THEMSELVES.  RATHER, THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT HOW ENGAGED </p><p>THE YOUNG ARE IN SAUDI ARABIA.  IT IS THE BOREDOM AND </p><p>LACK OF DIRECTION THAT INSPIRED THE YOUNGER BROTHER TO </p><p>FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN, AND IMPELS OTHERS DOMESTICALLY; </p><p>THAT IN TURN CAUSES CONCERN AMONG THE OLDER GENERATION, </p><p>WHO CHERISH THE STABILITY OF THE KINGDOM.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WELCH </p><p></p></div>
