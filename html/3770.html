<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002712 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FORMER HEAD OF STATE BUHARI--PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATE OR NORTHERN POLITICAL SPOILER? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASONS 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Disaffection with President Obasanjo has </p><p>placed three words into the lexicon of Northern politicians: </p><p>"Northern Consensus Candidate." One of the bruited names is </p><p>Mohammadu Buhari, former military Head of State from 1983 to </p><p>1985. Known as an honest, highly disciplined, hard-working, </p><p>anti-corruption crusader, Buhari\'s declared intention to seek </p><p>the ANPP presidential nomination has been well received at </p><p>grassroots levels in the North. This grassroots popularity </p><p>has not gone unnoticed; however, Buhari lacks a key </p><p>ingredient for success--elite backing to complement his </p><p>significant grassroots appeal. On September 6, national media </p><p>reported that Buhari wrote all former Heads of State, seeking </p><p>their advice and support.  The purpose of the Buhari letter </p><p>was not entirely clear, but appears an attempt to elicit </p><p>elite support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Summary Continued. By throwing his hat into the ring, </p><p>Buhari has added a new dimension to the presidential race and </p><p>has already caused strategy adjustments in other political </p><p>camps.  Although Buhari\'s Northern popular appeal is </p><p>significant, he may not play well in the South and Christian </p><p>Middle Belt because he is perceived as an Islamic </p><p>fundamentalist.  This perception, combined with his lack of </p><p>elite patronage could stop Buhari from becoming a major, </p><p>national contender and might relegate him to the role of </p><p>spoiler, a regional favorite son. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Like President Obasanjo before the 1999 election, </p><p>General Buhari\'s political experience is limited to that of </p><p>military Head of State.  Buhari came to power as a result of </p><p>a 1983 New Year\'s Eve coup against the democratically elected </p><p>Shehu Shagari.  The eviction of Shagari came as a welcome </p><p>relief as did Buhari\'s promise to root out corruption. That </p><p>relief, however, was short-lived as Nigerians watched </p><p>despairingly as the Buhari regime\'s promises to revive the </p><p>economy and wipe out rampant corruption withered during 20 </p><p>months of heavy-handed, largely ineffective rule. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) In May 1984, Buhari ordered the brutal expulsion of </p><p>700,000 illegal immigrants from neighboring African states, </p><p>jailed hundreds of political opponents and muzzled a once </p><p>aggressive press. His loyalty to the military also came into </p><p>question as he dismissed 30,000 soldiers as a cost-cutting </p><p>measure.  Buhari also soured Nigeria\'s relations with </p><p>Britain, when he was accused of masterminding a clumsy and </p><p>unsuccessful attempt in July 1984 to kidnap President </p><p>Shagari\'s brother-in-law, former Transport Minister Umaru </p><p>Dikko. Moreover, Buhari undermined traditional rulers </p><p>throughout Nigeria, slashing their benefits and questioning </p><p>their authority.  Still, many of these moves resonated well </p><p>with the common man.  Now, economic hard times and the </p><p>perception of avaricious politicians have caused many people </p><p>in the North to remember Buhari\'s efforts nostalgically and </p><p>see him as the man of the moment who can extirpate the </p><p>corrupt, machiavellian elitism that still characterizes </p><p>Nigerian politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Despite accusations of heavy-handedness, supporters </p><p>praise Buhari\'s former prosecution of corrupt public </p><p>officials, governors, Ministers and others.  Buhari </p><p>supporters also contend he performed well as chairman of the </p><p>now defunct Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF).  In fact, the PTF did </p><p>accelerate road construction, and subsidized agricultural </p><p>equipment and pharmaceuticals. Schools and water works were </p><p>also rehabilitated; some claim that the PTF performed better </p><p>than most Ministries.  However, detractors claim the PTF did </p><p>disproportionately more for the Northwest than any other </p><p>region, and that the South, in particular, was practically </p><p>ignored. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) As if he had not alienated enough people during his </p><p>previous tenure as Head of State, Buhari continues to trod on </p><p>sensitive toes in his current quest for the presidency. Due </p><p>to indelicate public statements, he has been accused </p><p>religious bigotry.  Last year, Buhari reportedly encouraged </p><p>Muslims to vote only for a Muslim President. These reports </p><p>caused a swift reaction in all sectors of Nigerian society, </p><p>particularly from the Christian clergy.  Buhari has been </p><p>accused of "playing the religion card" and stirring up </p><p>tensions.  Buhari compounded his political gaffe by waiting </p><p>two months before issuing a clarifying statement.  According </p><p>to Buhari, his call was not for exclusive voting along </p><p>religious lines, rather an appeal to conscience. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Buhari\'s current attempts to gain support from the </p><p>Southeast have also been unrefined.  After calling on the </p><p>Southeast to unite with the North, Buhari stoked ire in the </p><p>eastern region by tutoring Igbo politicians not to follow the </p><p>path set by previous generations of Igbo politicians he </p><p>described as mercenaries to the highest bidder.  (Comment: </p><p>While there may be a grain of truth in his remarks, it was </p><p>grossly impolitic and politically naive for Buhari, as a </p><p>visiting Northerner and supplicant for votes, to abuse and </p><p>embarrass his Igbo hosts. This episode demonstrates Buhari\'s </p><p>penchant for divisiveness in Nigerian politics, at the very </p><p>moment when Nigeria needs a leader to unify the nation. End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Buhari also stirred controversy last August when he </p><p>appeared as the special guest of honor at the first yearly </p><p>National Convention of the Supreme Council for Shari\'a in </p><p>Nigeria (SCSN). There, he urged Muslims to establish Shari\'a </p><p>in all 36 states, concluding the Islamic legal code had </p><p>restored sanity in the states where it had been enacted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) The effect of Buhari\'s most recent attempt at </p><p>politicking by writing to former Heads of State is likely to </p><p>fall flat as well. Enumerating the problems and shortcomings </p><p>of the current government, Buhari explained that the need for </p><p>quality national leadership compelled his entrance into </p><p>politics.  He wrote the former leaders out of respect, he </p><p>claimed, and sought their assistance and advice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) One of those former Heads of State was Ibrahim </p><p>Babangida.  A major factor determining Buhari\'s fate will be </p><p>his relationship with Babangida (IBB).  Taking over from </p><p>Buhari in a bloodless coup in 1985, Babangida, declared in </p><p>his first address Buhari was "too rigid and uncompromising." </p><p>Eventually Buhari was jailed by IBB, and not even allowed to </p><p>attend his mother\'s funeral.  Although the press runs </p><p>frequent speculation about a Babangida-Buhari reconciliation </p><p>and a possible anti-Obasanjo alliance, the chemistry between </p><p>the two is volatile; most insiders believe they are eternal </p><p>enemies.  More importantly, IBB probably is more wary of </p><p>Buhari than of any other potential candidate. Babangida would </p><p>much rather see Obasanjo return than deal with Buhari in the </p><p>driver\'s seat. IBB rightly senses that he likely would be one </p><p>of the first victims of Buhari\'s vindictive wrath should </p><p>Buhari capture Aso Rock. Even Buhari\'s own words--"I forgive </p><p>him, but I can never forget,"--indicate that IBB has reason </p><p>to fear a Buhari Presidency.  Consequently, IBB is probably </p><p>working actively to scuttle Buhari\'s chance of winning the </p><p>ANPP nomination; the stark truth for Buhari is that Babangida </p><p>is equally adept at being a "kingbreaker" as he is a </p><p>kingmaker.  A Buhari presidency is Babangida\'s worst </p><p>nightmare and IBB will do anything he can to stop it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U)  Buhari\'s run for President has altered Nigeria\'s </p><p>political landscape.  Recent power struggles to control the </p><p>ANPP\'s National Executive Committee have been partially </p><p>attributed to political jockeying by Buhari\'s foes. The ANPP </p><p>has unsuccessfully attempted to hold its convention on two </p><p>separate occasions; it was postponed until later this year </p><p>after being halted by a court injunction.  The source of the </p><p>injunction was never determined, but many speculated that the </p><p>PDP and the incumbent ANPP leadership conspired to prevent </p><p>the election of a pro-Buhari leadership.  Others contend that </p><p>IBB was the one who scuttled the convention,  with an </p><p>unrelenting intent to stop Buhari.  A device being used to </p><p>undermine Buhari is to zone the ANPP National Chairmanship to </p><p>the Northwest; under the party guidelines, the Presidential </p><p>candidate and the National Chairman cannot hail from the same </p><p>geopolitical zone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Despite (or because of) this opposition, Buhari seeks </p><p>to build a credible political machine.  Many key advisors are </p><p>recycled from his earlier incarnation and have participated </p><p>in numerous coups during Nigeria\'s troubled history.  Some </p><p>remained through the IBB years, although to hear them talk, </p><p>they never approved of Buhari\'s removal.  Members of the </p><p>group are largely northern Muslims, but some retired military </p><p>personnel from other regions are also reportedly on board. </p><p>One backer, explaining the organization\'s strategy to Poloff, </p><p>acknowledged that some of Buhari\'s earlier statements had </p><p>been misinterpreted and that the group realizes that enormous </p><p>effort will be required to overcome the skepticism of </p><p>Christians and southerners.  Still Buhari was extremely </p><p>popular with the common man in the North, which accounted for </p><p>fifty percent of Nigeria\'s voting population.  He speculated </p><p>that Buhari\'s inner circle would soon select a point man from </p><p>among his Christian supporters and that the group was ready </p><p>to embark on a sustained effort to ensure Buhari\'s nomination </p><p>by the ANPP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>13. (C) All in all, Buhari represents an ideologically vague </p><p>but psychologically resonant viewpoint in the North.  He is </p><p>the pennant for a religiously conservative, yet politically </p><p>anti-establishment Northern populism.  It is these adjectival </p><p>qualities that strongly endear him to those who fit into this </p><p>category but also alienate him from the many Nigerians who do </p><p>not. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) At the moment, Buhari is the most prominent figure in </p><p>the ANPP; however, this does not mean he will win the prize. </p><p>Buhari has many powerful enemies with more money and back </p><p>room clout than he does.  Consequently his fight to win the </p><p>ANPP nomination is an uphill one. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C)Buhari also has to find a way to traverse the great </p><p>regional and religious divides that separate him from his </p><p>Southern and Christian compatriots.  If he emerges as the </p><p>ANPP candidate, region and religion will be cardinal, and </p><p>hugely divisive campaign issues.  Southerners and Christians </p><p>will oppose him relentlessly.  Moreover, Buhari is unlikely </p><p>to be able to unite the North due to his history with </p><p>Babangida and other political elites in the Northern </p><p>establishment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16 (C) Given the cleavages inherent in a Buhari campaign, </p><p>Obasanjo probably sees Buhari as someone he would like to run </p><p>against.  Buhari could only be assured of taking those areas </p><p>in the North that Obasanjo will lose in any event.  Buhari </p><p>would push more and larger chunks of the Christian Middle </p><p>Belt, moderate Muslim, and Southern vote into Obasanjo\'s camp </p><p>than any other conceivable candidate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
