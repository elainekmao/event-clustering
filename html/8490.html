<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001274 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/USOAS, WHA/CAR, AND WHA/CEN </p><p>STATE FOR L/WHA, L/T, AND S/CT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, KTIA, AORC, HO, OAS </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAS HAS SIGNED BUT NOT YET RATIFIED 2002 </p><p>INTER-AMERICAN CONVENTION AGAINST TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 118495 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 112939 </p><p>     C. TEGUCIGAPA 862 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The Government of Honduras has signed but not yet </p><p>ratified both the 2002 Inter-American Convention Against </p><p>Terrorism (ref A), as well as the 1971 Convention to Prevent </p><p>and Punish the Acts of Terrorism Taking the Forms of Crimes </p><p>Against Persons and Related Extortion that are of </p><p>International Significance.  USG officials, from the </p><p>Secretary to the Ambassador to PolOff, have repeatedly urged </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>senior GOH officials, including President Ricardo Maduro and </p><p>Foreign Minister Guillermo Perez-Cadalso Arias, to ratify </p><p>these two conventions, as well as five UN counterterrorism </p><p>conventions/protocols that the GOH has yet to sign and/or </p><p>ratify (refs B and C). </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Senior GOH officials have told EmbOffs that they </p><p>will soon submit the two OAS conventions to the Congress for </p><p>approval, but they have yet to do so.  No GOH official has </p><p>voiced any concern to EmbOffs that ratifying the two </p><p>conventions would be problematic for Honduras.  Neither the </p><p>GOH nor Post believe that congressional approval would be </p><p>difficult or controversial.  Once Congress has approved the </p><p>conventions and the congressional resolution has been </p><p>published in La Gaceta (akin to the Federal Register), the </p><p>GOH would then need to deposit its instruments of </p><p>ratification with the OAS.  Post notes that the Honduran </p><p>Congress is currently on recess until early July. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Post recommends that the U.S. delegation to the OAS </p><p>Assembly in Santiago urge the Honduran delegation to move </p><p>promptly to ratify the two OAS counterterrorism conventions </p><p>without further delay. </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
