(SBU) Summary: The poaching of wild game, by both </p><p>commercial and subsistence hunters, has now reached </p><p>crisis proportions in Zimbabwe.  Game is being </p><p>illegally taken from occupied private reserves and </p><p>conservancies, national parks, and occupied farms that </p><p>may or may not border protected game areas.  The </p><p>hunting and wild game industry claims that US $40 </p><p>million of game has been poached from private reserves </p><p>since the land invasions started in 2000 (based on lost </p><p>international hunting revenue).  Snaring is endemic on </p><p>occupied properties including commercial farms and game </p><p>preserves, and national park boundaries are no longer </p><p>respected by rural dwellers, be it for grazing, </p><p>firewood collection or wildlife harvesting.  Also </p><p>associated with the poaching is widespread destruction </p><p>of habitat, mainly deforestation, but also riparian </p><p>damage caused by illegal gold panning and unmanaged </p><p>poor farming practices. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Organized commercial poaching has gotten so </p><p>bad in the Zambezi Valley that the Minister of </p><p>Environment and Tourism recently announced the dispatch </p><p>of a 200-man task force of soldiers, police and </p><p>National Parks game scouts and guides to help control </p><p>the stock loss.  One contact at National Parks told </p><p>Econoff that between 6 and 10 elephants were being </p><p>killed monthly in the Kariba/Zambezi Valley park </p><p>system.  The situation was degenerating fast, he told </p><p>us, and he and his colleagues had pointed out to their </p><p>superiors the threat the rampant poaching poised to </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s obligations under the CITES convention and </p><p>also the Trans-Boundary Park and Conservation </p><p>agreements recently signed by Zimbabwe.  It was only </p><p>these factors that got action, because in many cases </p><p>the local powers-that-be share in the spoils of the </p><p>organized hunting groups. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The commercial poachers, who are armed and </p><p>often utilize packs of dogs, target elephants and </p><p>rhinos for their trophies, and all other plains game </p><p>for their meat.  The informal or subsistence poachers </p><p>target anything that moves, and use wire snares to </p><p>capture or disable their prey. A number of factors lie </p><p>behind this increased activity, and principal among </p><p>them are: the general decline in respect for law and </p><p>order engendered by GOZ-sanctioned activity against </p><p>opposition supporters in the pre- and post-election </p><p>period; the widespread invasion and occupation of </p><p>commercial farms and game reserves or conservancies </p><p>(and the associated notion that anything on the </p><p>properties is, so to speak, fair game); declining </p><p>incomes; and growing food insecurity. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The conservancy and hunting industry tells us </p><p>that it has lost game worth more than US $40 million </p><p>since the farm and property invasions began in 2000. </p><p>Some conservancies have lost 60 percent of their </p><p>animals.  The Parks Service is unable to quantify its </p><p>losses, and up until recently it was denying that a </p><p>problem even existed.  Ruling party officials and </p><p>provincial authorities have been witnessed on numerous </p><p>occasions by commercial farmers and professional </p><p>hunters leading weekend sweeps in public and private </p><p>game parks, and on farms occupied by indigenous </p><p>settlers.  A weekly independent newspaper recently </p><p>published details of a letter from a rural district </p><p>council chairman to the local police officer-in-charge, </p><p>seeking police transport, personnel and weapons to </p><p>shoot a dozen large plains game animals on listed and </p><p>unlisted farms to feed ZANU-PF youth militia at four </p><p>training camps located in the district.  Similar </p><p>behavior, but less well documented, occurs daily we are </p><p>told. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The head of the Save Conservancy, one of the </p><p>world\'s largest private game sanctuaries (3,400 sq. </p><p>km), recently stated that game loss and habitat </p><p>destruction from settlers on designated portions of the </p><p>reserve has "reached the point where we have to </p><p>reconsider the future and viability of the whole </p><p>project.  Since August 2001 we have documented a total </p><p>of 718 animals killed, including 6 wild dogs (of a </p><p>total of 110), one black rhino, five elephant, 68 </p><p>eland, 312 impala, 175 kudu, a leopard, 27 zebra and 52 </p><p>warthogs and other smaller game."  The undocumented </p><p>loss could easily be much larger than this count, as </p><p>large occupied areas of the conservancy have been no-go </p><p>areas for more than 18 months.  At another conservancy </p><p>in the same region, an anti-poaching patrol came across </p><p>a poachers\' camp two weeks and "we caught five guys </p><p>with 34 dead warthog, and a whole bunch of sable, </p><p>antelope, bush pigs and dassies (the hyrax, a badger </p><p>relative).  They\'d been there for 4 days and some of </p><p>the meat was already going off, but they were still </p><p>hunting.  The warthogs alone had a trophy value of US </p><p>$100-200 each." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Comment: Poaching has undeniably ramped up </p><p>steeply in the last year, and the head of the Wildlife </p><p>Association told Econoff that he believes that at least </p><p>20 percent of the national total herd has been taken in </p><p>the last two years.  The owners of two butcher shops </p><p>that sell to the residents of high-density townships in </p><p>the small towns of Bindura and Marondera related that </p><p>over the last six months 20 to 40 percent of their meat </p><p>sales have been game, which is clearly being hunted </p><p>aggressively to supplement incomes and food needs.  As </p><p>is the case with commercial agriculture, no one in </p><p>government seems particularly concerned that a national </p><p>asset is being stolen and destroyed with great </p><p>rapidity, contributing to Zimbabwe\'s slide to a </p><p>distopia.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
