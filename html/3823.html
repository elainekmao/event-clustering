<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001254 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, BM, Ethnics, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: STRONG ETHNIC SHOWING AT NLD\'S 14TH ANNIVERSARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Amidst strong support from Western </p><p>diplomats and ethnic representatives the NLD celebrated its </p><p>14th anniversary on September 27 in downtown Rangoon.  NLD </p><p>leaders called for the SPDC to enter into dialogue without </p><p>delay for the benefit of the country.  An array of leaders </p><p>from ethnic parties pledged to continue working hand in hand </p><p>with the NLD.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The NLD celebrated its 14th anniversary on September </p><p>27 with a ceremony at its headquarters in downtown Rangoon. </p><p>Approximately 500 people attended the ceremony, including NLD </p><p>members, ethnic party leaders, Ambassadors from the United </p><p>States, Australia, Britain, France, and Germany, staff from </p><p>the Indian, Japanese, and Norwegian embassies (ASEAN </p><p>countries were notably absent), the WHO country </p><p>representative, UNICEF staff, and local press. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) NLD General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi gave a brief </p><p>keynote address saying that on her recent trips around the </p><p>country she has seen that people lack security.  She stated </p><p>that the SPDC should not try to break the people but work for </p><p>their benefit and the benefit of the country.  On a </p><p>conciliatory note, she said that the NLD wants to work for </p><p>the "national cause," calling on the SPDC to join hands with </p><p>the NLD to enjoy the fruits of democracy. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo then read a lengthy </p><p>statement recounting the origins of the party in 1988 and </p><p>what it stood for then and still stands for today i.e., that </p><p>sovereignty descends from the people, that human dignity is </p><p>not to be crushed under foot, that free and fair elections </p><p>must be held, that the rights of minorities must be </p><p>respected, and that there must be equality before the law. </p><p>He then gave a brief historical overview of the 1990 </p><p>elections, the SLORC\'s "failure to honor" the election </p><p>results, and subsequent problems with the National </p><p>Convention. He noted that it is imperative to have a </p><p>practicing democracy to solve the political, economic, </p><p>social, educational, and health problems of Burma and </p><p>challenged the SPDC to work together with the NLD for the </p><p>benefit of the people. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Turning up the heat just a little, U Tin Oo recalled </p><p>that upon ASSK\'s release in May the SPDC declared that it was </p><p>"opening a new historic page," noting that these words can </p><p>only be meaningful if there is dialogue between the SPDC and </p><p>NLD.  He clarified that there has been no dialogue yet, </p><p>neither a "defacto" dialogue nor a "low-level" dialogue, and </p><p>said the SPDC must have the will to engage in dialogue.  He </p><p>called for the release of all political prisoners "without </p><p>any further delay" and said the NLD\'s policies on the results </p><p>of the 1990 election, the National Convention which started </p><p>in 1993, the drawing of the National Constitution, foreign </p><p>investment, and tourism will remain unchanged until there is </p><p>substantive and meaningful dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The leaders of virtually all prominent, and some </p><p>obscure, ethnic political parties were in attendance and </p><p>several took the podium to read letters of felicitation and </p><p>to pledge their support to the NLD and Aung San Suu Kyi. </p><p>Leaders from the Shan State Kokang Democratic Party, the </p><p>United Nationalities League for Democracy, the Mon National </p><p>Democratic Front, the Kamans National League for Democracy, </p><p>the United Nationalities Alliance, and the 23 Veterans group </p><p>read letters of support for the NLD.  Sitting with the NLD </p><p>Central Executive Committee were leaders from the Mon, Zomi </p><p>(Chin), Arakan, Shan, Karen, Kachin, and Karenni parties </p><p>represented in the 1990 elections.  U Aye Tha Aung, the </p><p>Arakan League for Democracy leader who serves as Secretary on </p><p>the Committee Representing the Peoples\' Parliament, was also </p><p>in attendence. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Comment:  The NLD, and particularly Aung San Suu Kyi, </p><p>continued to call for political progress in a </p><p>non-confrontational manner.  They noted the urgent need for </p><p>political change to address growing problems in the country </p><p>without putting the blame on the SPDC for the deteriorating </p><p>conditions.  Unfortunately, it does not look like the </p><p>non-confrontational approach is bearing fruit, and it will be </p><p>difficult to sustain over the long run without some progress. </p><p> Clearly the most significant aspect of the ceremony was the </p><p>support shown by the ethnic parties.  Not only did they show </p><p>up in force at the event, they publicly stated that they are </p><p>working hand in hand with the NLD and would continue to do </p><p>so.  This strengthens the NLD\'s claim that it enjoys the </p><p>support of the ethnic groups.  Whether it works to encourage </p><p>or discourage the SPDC to enter into dialogue, time will </p><p>tell.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
