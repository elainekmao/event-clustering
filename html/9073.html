<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 OTTAWA 001863 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EB </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ECIN, EFIN, ETRD, EINV, ETTC, CVIS, PREL, PTER, PINR, LE, XF, ETRN, Terrorist Finance </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S WAYNE\'S MEETING WITH LEBANESE MINISTER OF </p><p>ECONOMY AND TRADE HAMADEH </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (SBU)  Summary:  During a bilateral meeting held June 25 </p><p>on the margins of the International Arab Banking Summit in </p><p>Montreal, A/S Anthony Wayne and Lebanese Minister of Economy </p><p>and Trade Marwan Hamadeh discussed the regional economic </p><p>situation with a focus on the fight against terrorist </p><p>financing; cooperation on Iraq; implementation of Paris II; </p><p>and trade issues including IPR protection and the President\'s </p><p>initiatives on the Middle East Free Trade Agreement (MEFTA) </p><p>and Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI).  There was </p><p>also discussion of the visa status of Minister of Finance </p><p>Siniora and the recent cancellation of Air Canada\'s </p><p>Beirut-Montreal flight.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>USG Action </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Action requests for information to provide to </p><p>Minister Hamadeh are in para 13 (status of the visa review </p><p>for Minister of Finance Siniora) and para 14 (contact </p><p>information on the Baghdad Forum). </p><p> </p><p>No Economic Collapse, but Some Stumbling Blocks </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) A/S Wayne opened the meeting by expressing his </p><p>pleasant surprise at the perseverance of the Lebanese </p><p>economy, noting that the economic collapse many feared had </p><p>not come about.  Hamadeh explained that Lebanon has an </p><p>economy not of figures, but of atmosphere, climate, and the </p><p>confidence of the Lebanese, and cited the secure Pound, the </p><p>increasing balance of payments, and the level of Central Bank </p><p>reserves as positive signs.  He confirmed that Paris II </p><p>implementation is proceeding well -- most countries have </p><p>honored their commitments -- but it has been complicated by </p><p>the situation in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) GOL privatization plans have been delayed by the war </p><p>in Iraq (as they do not want to sell at depressed prices) but </p><p>are continuing.  The GOL will call for adjudication of firms </p><p>in the telecom field very shortly, and already has </p><p>pre-qualified a number of companies, mainly from the region </p><p>and Europe.  However, if the financial offers are weak the </p><p>GOL may start with partial privatizations, for example </p><p>spinning off only the management function of certain firms. </p><p>All privatization revenue will be dedicated to debt reduction </p><p>and go into a special fund for that purpose.  He added that </p><p>the GOL needs to cut military expenses but that is difficult </p><p>when "the region is still boiling." </p><p> </p><p>Ambitious Plans on Trade (and IPR Protection) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Hamadeh stressed the GOL focus on three main tasks: </p><p> </p><p>1.  Positioning Lebanon in the emerging Arab common market; </p><p>2.  Concluding an accord de participation with the EU; </p><p> </p><p>3.  Acceding to the WTO. </p><p> </p><p>In the context of the EU agreement he highlighted IPR </p><p>protection and quality control as areas that will need work. </p><p>He later expanded on this, detailing complaints made by EU </p><p>firms, with specific mention of Chanel and Louis Vuitton. </p><p>Pointing out that it makes most sense to cut off the flow of </p><p>illegal goods at the point of origin (China), he added that </p><p>the scale of counterfeiting makes that infeasible.   As a </p><p>result, Lebanese customs is increasing its efforts to prevent </p><p>entry or transit of counterfeit goods. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) A/S Wayne detailed continuing USG concerns about IPR </p><p>protection (pharmaceuticals, optical disk piracy, cable TV </p><p>piracy, etc.), noting that Lebanon was named to the Special </p><p>301 Priority Watch List.  Hamadeh acknowledged that Lebanon </p><p>ranked 13th in our report, and that is "not a good position." </p><p> He added that IPR protection is "foreign to the Lebanese </p><p>mind," and the laissez-faire attitude has gone to </p><p>unacceptable extremes. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) On the status of the legislation amending the </p><p>Industrial Property Law, Hamadeh said that it is moving </p><p>forward.  Although the Ministry of Health has the lead, it </p><p>involves a wide range of GOL agencies so progress is slow. </p><p>However, he is doing his utmost to keep it moving forward and </p><p>committed to continue his efforts.    (There was no comment </p><p>on whether the MOH would stop registering unauthorized copies </p><p>of pharmaceutical products.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) A/S Wayne stressed the need to bring piracy of </p><p>copyrighted material, especially cable TV content and optical </p><p>media, under control and asked what we can do to support GOL </p><p>efforts to combat piracy.  Hamadeh said that in response to </p><p>USG concerns he will personally look into the pirate factory </p><p>reportedly operating in a Hizballah region.  "I can assure </p><p>you that we are making big efforts in three areas (qualifying </p><p>for WTO and the trade agreements with the EU and GCC).  We </p><p>know this (IPR) is a major battlefield and we will engage. </p><p>We are committed.  However, our means are not always up to </p><p>our determination.  I\'ll put more pressure on, and the Prime </p><p>Minister really wants to do something."  In response to the </p><p>offer of USG assistance, he said, "there are daily visits of </p><p>your people in our Ministry." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Note:  over the course of the conversation Hamadeh </p><p>expressed his appreciation for USG support, with specific </p><p>mention of USAID assistance with Lebanon\'s WTO accession and </p><p>USG guidance on cracking down on IPR violations.  He referred </p><p>several times to his close coordination with Embassy Beirut </p><p>and Ambassador Battle.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>Continued Commitment to Counter Terrorist Financing </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>10. ( SBU) A/S Wayne thanked Hamadeh for Lebanon\'s strong </p><p>cooperation on the fight against terrorist financing and in </p><p>blocking Iraqi assets.  Hamadeh emphasized that the GOL is </p><p>committed to doing whatever is necessary to prevent the flow </p><p>of terrorist funds through the Lebanese financial system. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) While expressing strong commitment to the fight </p><p>against terrorist financing, Hamadeh asked for USG </p><p>understanding of the nuances of dealing with Hizballah.  He </p><p>stressed that the USG\'s supporters in Lebanon should not be </p><p>pushed to "perilous choices."  He acknowledged  that the USG </p><p>is showing some patience regarding Hizballah, but the people </p><p>consider it successful in removing the Israelis (so do not </p><p>support punitive moves).  He advised that Lebanon should be </p><p>treated with a lot of delicatesse.  "We should not always be </p><p>penalized for things we are not directly responsible for. </p><p>You have friends in the Middle East.  They deserve to be </p><p>treated with patience and good will." </p><p> </p><p>Beirut-Montreal Flight Was Safe </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>12. (SBU) Hamadeh raised the Canadian government\'s recent </p><p>cancellation of Air Canada\'s Montreal-Beirut flight, saying </p><p>unofficial Canadian channels suggest it was due to USG </p><p>pressure, and that "we see it as reflecting your view of </p><p>Hizballah."  He stressed that Beirut airport is one of the </p><p>safest in the world and that flights from all over Europe </p><p>travel in and out without incident.  The cancellation does </p><p>not stop travel between Montreal and Beirut; people just </p><p>transit Europe.  A/S Wayne responded that we try to be </p><p>understanding, but we consider Hizballah a terrorist </p><p>organization.  (Note:  Cancellation of the Beirut-Montreal </p><p>flight came up frequently during the course of the day, </p><p>always with the knowing assumption that the GOC acted in </p><p>response to USG arm-twisting.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>MinFin\'s Visa </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) On Finance Minister Siniora\'s visa situation, A/S </p><p>Wayne confirmed that we know and respect the work he has done </p><p>to strengthen US-Lebanon ties; that we are conducting a </p><p>thorough review, and expect a determination shortly. </p><p>Hamadeh, who was familiar with the situation, suggested that </p><p>the problem arose during Ramadan when Ministers are inundated </p><p>with requests for charitable contributions at iftar dinners, </p><p>and try to be equitable in contributions to Sunni and Shiite </p><p>charities.  He went into some detail on the history and </p><p>affiliation of various Shiite leaders, making a distinction </p><p>between those who are involved with Hizballah and those, such </p><p>as the one to whom he believes the contribution was made, who </p><p>have distanced themselves from the organization, notably </p><p>Fadlallah (sp?).  Wayne undertook to check on the status of </p><p>USG action on the visa situation. </p><p> </p><p>Looking forward to continued cooperation on Iraq:  tracing </p><p>assets and increasing trade </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Lebanese traders are extremely interested in </p><p>getting involved in Iraq, but Hamadeh is urging them to be </p><p>cautious, citing the risk of becoming involved with militia </p><p>or unethical operators.  Ambassador Battle has assured him </p><p>that there is "no veto" against participation by Lebanese </p><p>companies in Iraqi reconstruction.  A/S Wayne noted that </p><p>there is not yet a system for coordinating commercial </p><p>facilitation, and suggested the GOL or Lebanese companies </p><p>find a means to participate in the Forum in Baghdad that was </p><p>recently established for such tasks.  He promised to provide </p><p>Hamadeh with a contact point and more information on the </p><p>Forum. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Hamadeh confirmed that Lebanon will continue to </p><p>cooperate closely in the search for Iraqi assets; will do </p><p>what is necessary to block and return Iraqi assets; and will </p><p>welcome the visit from forensic accountants once that is </p><p>requested by the Iraqi Central Bank.  He revealed that the </p><p>Iraqi Ambassador had tried repeatedly to withdraw large </p><p>amounts of cash from an account (before the freeze was </p><p>announced), but the GOL had limited him to approximately </p><p>$10,000 a month to pay salaries, or to transfers to an </p><p>account in another financial institution (an option of which </p><p>the Ambassador did not avail himself). </p><p> </p><p>Time for a Syria-Lebanon Annex to Road Map </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) Hamadeh stressed that it is "high time to think of a </p><p>Syria-Lebanon annex for the Road Map," saying that is a view </p><p>that has been conveyed many times to Secretary Powell. </p><p>Bringing in the Syrians would provide a better approach on </p><p>the Palestinian front and a more relaxed situation in Lebanon. </p><p> </p><p>Great Interest in Details of MEFTA </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) Hamadeh showed great interest in the details of </p><p>MEFTA (Middle East Free Trade Agreement) and listened closely </p><p>to A/S Wayne\'s description of the President\'s vision.  (Note: </p><p> based on questions during the panel discussion and </p><p>throughout the day; Hamadeh\'s interest reflects a thirst for </p><p>detail in the region.  End note.)  After hearing A/S Wayne\'s </p><p>explanation of the various methods by which the initial FTAs </p><p>in the region could be expanded, he said Lebanon would </p><p>probably favor the option of cumulative addition of countries </p><p>to existing FTAs.  He explained that Lebanon faces serious </p><p>problems with trade through both Syria and Jordan, saying </p><p>they do not properly implement their FTAs with Lebanon and </p><p>are charging high transshipment duties.  He said the GCC has </p><p>indicated a willingness to include Lebanon in its plans for </p><p>an emerging common market (implying that Lebanon has more in </p><p>common with the trading nations of the Gulf than with its </p><p>immediate neighbors). </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) A/S Wayne described MEPI (Middle East Partnership </p><p>Initiative), and praised Lebanon\'s heritage of higher </p><p>education, saying it is unique in the region and probably a </p><p>major reason Lebanon\'s economy has survived as well as it </p><p>has.  Hamadeh responded somewhat grimly that "we have to </p><p>defend daily that heritage," and that there are strong forces </p><p>that continue to resist both education and economic reforms. </p><p> </p><p>Bio </p><p>--- </p><p>19. (U) On the English version of his business card Hamadeh </p><p>spells his name "Hamad" (with an accent grave on the final </p><p>e).  He started his working life as a journalist, including a </p><p>stint in Vietnam from 1967-68, and entered parliament in the </p><p>early \'80s.  His past ministerial posts include Tourism, </p><p>Health, and Displaced People.  This is his second stint as </p><p>Minister of the Economy.  Hamadeh is extremely fluent </p><p>English. </p><p> </p><p>20. (U)  A/S Wayne cleared this cable. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
