<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000591 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "No really, it could work" </p><p>Under the sub-heading, "Though counterintuitive, Bush\'s </p><p>warpath might lead to Mideast peace," columnist Marcus </p><p>Gee commented in the leading Globe and Mail (2/28): </p><p>"...As Mr. Bush sees it, solving the Arab-Israeli </p><p>dispute would remove one of the grievances that helps </p><p>fuel anti-Americanism and complicates the fight against </p><p>terrorism. The American desire for peace </p><p>springs from the strongest motive: self-interest. So </p><p>after the United States goes to war, it will turn once </p><p>again to the harder job of peace." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "U.S. serious about democracy in Mideast" </p><p>Columnist Marcus Gee wrote in the leading Globe and </p><p>Mail (2/27): "...Whatever Washington\'s critics may say, </p><p>there is no way that the United States is going to </p><p>replace Saddam Hussein with a friendly thug and get </p><p>out. Idealistic? Dangerous? Perhaps. There is always </p><p>the danger that Muslims would see the attempt to build </p><p>democracy in Iraq as an imperial enterprise, setting </p><p>off a backlash that would make anti-Americanism worse, </p><p>not better." </p><p> </p><p>3. "George W. Bush, the engineer" </p><p>Editorialist Mario Roy wrote in the centrist La Presse </p><p>(2/28): "George W. Bush redrew the map of the Middle- </p><p>East and undertook some spectacular political </p><p>engineering work on Wednesday.... Everything is </p><p>coherent with what could be called the Wolfowitz </p><p>doctrine...the U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary and a high </p><p>level strategist who considers it the West\'s duty to </p><p>spread its values of liberty and democracy. But we have </p><p>said it before: imposing democracy by force is not a </p><p>good idea.... Moreover, one cannot imagine a worst </p><p>guide than America to show the way especially in this </p><p>region where, rightly or wrongly, the U.S. is </p><p>thoroughly detested. The fact that the Bush </p><p>administration fails to see these pitfalls leaves us </p><p>speechless." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
