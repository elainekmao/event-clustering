(S) ZWI TAL(PROTECT), DCM OF THE ISRAELI EMBASSY TO THE </p><p>HOLY SEE, GAVE DCM HIS EMBASSY\'S PERSPECTIVE OF THE MAY 10 </p><p>MEETING AMONG ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER PERES, VATICAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER-EQUIVALENT TAURAN, AND VATICAN PRIME </p><p>MINISTER-EQUIVALENT SODANO.  TAL\'S VIEWS ARE BASED ON A </p><p>READ-OUT OF THE MEETING HE RECEIVED FROM HIS AMBASSADOR, </p><p>YOSEF LAMDAN, WHO ATTENDED THE MEETING. </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  02292  101502Z </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) ACCORDING TO TAL, MEETING WAS MORE OF A BRIEFING ON </p><p>THE PART OF PERES, THAN AN ACTUAL EXCHANGE OF VIEWS.  THE ONE </p><p>ISSUE OF ACTUAL DISCUSSION WAS THE ROLE OF ARAFAT AS A </p><p>PARTNER IN THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.  PERES SAID THAT ARAFAT </p><p>STILL HAD TO PROVE HE IS A SERIOUS PARTNER AND COULD CONTROL </p><p>THE VIOLENCE; PERES SAID THAT THE GOI WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIM </p><p>A CHANCE.  SODANO INSISTED, HOWEVER, THAT ARAFAT IS THE </p><p>LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, AND AS </p><p>SUCH MUST BE THE INDIVIDUAL WITH WHOM THE ISRAELIS ENGAGE. </p><p> </p><p>3.(S) THE ISRAELI SIDE WAS MOST SURPRISED THAT THE VATICAN </p><p>RAISED THE SITUATION IN BETHLEHEM ONLY IN PASSING.  TAL </p><p>REPORTED THAT SODANO "EXPRESSED SATISFACTION" THAT THE </p><p>SITUATION HAS BEEN RESOLVED, BUT "TRUE TO FORM" OFFERED NO </p><p>WORDS OF THANKS TO THE ISRAELIS.  SODANO "REHASHED" THE </p><p>VATICAN POSITION ON "TWO PEOPLES/TWO STATES", AS WELL AS THE </p><p>NEED FOR DISCUSSIONS ON JERUSALEM.  TAL SAID, "TO BE FAIR" </p><p>NEITHER SODANO NOR TAURAN EXPRESSED SERIOUS ANNOYANCE WITH </p><p>THE ISRAELI MILITARY ACTION, AND ALLOWED PERES TO EXPLAIN HOW </p><p>THE ACTION HAS SUCCEEDED IN DISMANTLING MUCH OF THE TERRORIST </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE. </p><p> </p><p>4.(S) TAL SAID THAT IN THE RIDE BACK FROM THE MEETING, PERES </p><p>TOLD LAMDAN THAT ISRAELI/VATICAN RELATIONS ARE "NOT AS BAD" </p><p>AS EVERYONE BELIEVES. </p><p> </p><p>5.(S) POST WILL REPORT ON VATICAN\'S PERCEPTION OF MEETING </p><p>SEPTEL.
