(C - ENTIRE TEXT). </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN TEHRAN AND RIYADH </p><p>CONTINUES AT A HIGH PITCH.  FOR THE IRANIANS, THE SAUDIS </p><p>ARE SERVANTS AND INSTRUMENTS FOR "WORLD ARROGANCE" OR </p><p>THE "GREAT SATAN" (I.E. THE U.S.) WHO HAVE PERPETRATED A </p><p>"DIRTY, UGLY, ODIOUS AND MONSTROUS ACT" IN MECCA AND WHO </p><p>WITH THE KUWAITIS PLOTTED TO BRING THE FORCES OF THEIR </p><p>U.S. MASTERS INTO THE GULF.  FAHD AND THE AL SAUD ARE </p><p>CONDEMNED AS LIARS, OPPRESSORS AND CORRUPT RULERS, </p><p>UNWORTHY OF CONTROLLING ISLAM\'S HOLIEST SITES.  THESE </p><p>CHARGES ARE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OFFENSIVE TO THE </p><p>SAUDIS.  THEY HAVE RESPONDED VIGOROUSLY, AT HOME AND </p><p>ABROAD.  THE SAUDIS TAKE TWO LINES IN REGARD TO THE </p><p>IRANIANS:  A RELIGIOUS APPROACH ARGUING THAT THE </p><p>IRANIANS ARE GUILTY OF "USING ISLAM TO SERVE POLITICS" </p><p>AND THAT IRANIAN METHODS AND BEHAVIOR DIRECTLY </p><p>CONTRAVENE ISLAMIC LAW;  AND A POLITICAL APPROACH THAT </p><p>DEPICTS THE IRANIANS AS FANATICS, COMPULSIVE LIARS, AND </p><p>PROVOCATEURS WHO SYSTEMATICALLY SHOW CONTEMPT FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RULES AND FOR ATTEMPTS TO DEAL CIVILLY </p><p>WITH THEM.  IMAGES EMPHASIZED BY THE SAUDIS INCLUDE THE </p><p>RIOTS AT MAKKAH (WITH IRANIAN ATTEMPTS TO SMUGGLE </p><p>EXPLOSIVES IN 1986), THE ATTACKS ON EMBASSIES, AND NOW </p><p>THE INHUMAN TREATMENT RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF SAUDI </p><p>DIPLOMAT AL-GHAMDI.  SAUDI OFFICIAL AND PRESS TREATMENT </p><p>DIFFER ONLY IN TONE:  OFFICIALS TEND TO PLAY THESE </p><p>THEMES MORE IN SORROW THAN IN ANGER.  THE SAUDIS MAY </p><p>TIRE OF THIS UNACCUSTOMED LEVEL OF RHETORIC, BUT NOT </p><p>UNLESS THE IRANIANS BACK OFF.  THE SAUDIS SEE THEIR </p><p>POSITION AS STRONG DIPLOMATICALLY, PROPAGANDISTICALLY, </p><p>AND RELIGIOUSLY, INCLUDING IN THE AREA OF POSSIBLE </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON THE IRANIANS FOR NEXT YEAR\'S HAJJ.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN RIYADH AND TEHRAN, WHICH </p><p>BEGAN IN EARNEST AFTER THE MAKKAH VIOLENCE OF JULY 31, </p><p>CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE SAUDI PRESS, ANSWERING THE </p><p>VIRULENT RHETORIC ISSUING FROM TEHRAN.  THE IRANIANS </p><p>CALL FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE SAG AND ACCUSE THE SAG </p><p>DAILY OF MASSACRING HUNDREDS OF MUSLIMS IN MAKKAH AND OF </p><p>VARIOUS OTHER RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL "CRIMES".  IRANIAN </p><p>MAJLIS SPEAKER RAFSANJANI\'S FRIDAY SERMON OF AUGUST 21 </p><p>(REF A) PROVIDES A COMPENDIUM OF IRAN\'S PROPAGANDA </p><p>THEMES, CONSTANTLY REECHOED IN PRINT AND ELECTRONIC </p><p>MEDIA.  TAKING AS HIS CENTRAL THEME "ARROGANCE VS. </p><p>MEEKNESS," RAFSANJANI DISCUSSES FIRST THE WAR AND SECOND </p><p>THE "EXISTING SITUATION IN THE REGION."  HE ESTABLISHES </p><p>AS HIS FRAMEWORK THE PROPOSITION THAT "WORLD </p><p>ARROGANCE"--THE U.S., PORTRAYED AS THE "MASTERS AND </p><p>SUPPORTERS OF IRAQ AND OTHER PUPPETS--HAS BEEN FORCED BY </p><p>THE PROSPECT OF AN IMMINENT IRANIAN VICTORY TO ABANDON </p><p>ITS PRETENSE OF NEUTRALITY AND COME OUT IN THE OPEN IN </p><p>THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AFTER AN EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION IN KORANIC TERMS OF </p><p>THE NATURE OF ARROGANCE AND U.S. ORCHESTRATION OF THE </p><p>WAR AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGION AND THE </p><p>INEVITABLE DEFEAT OF THE U.S. AND ITS DESIGNS, </p><p>RAFSANJANI MOVES ON TO DISCUSS SAUDI ARABIA.  ADDRESSING </p><p>THE U.S., HE SAYS "YOU HAVE HAD TO FORCE SAUDI ARABIA TO </p><p>COMMIT SUICIDE IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY ACHIEVE YOUR ENDS. </p><p>THE HOUSE OF SAUD WAS MUCH TOO WISE TO SOIL ITS HANDS IN </p><p>A CRIME WHICH ACCORDING TO THE IMAM\'S SAYING CAN NEVER </p><p>BE CLEANSED WITH WATER OF ZAMZAM UNTIL ETERNITY.  EVEN </p><p>IF MR. FAHD BATHS IN THE WELL OF ZAMZAM, NOBODY COULD </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THE (STAIN) COULD BE ERADICATED."  IN </p><p>CONTEXT, THIS ATTACK APPEARS TO REFER BOTH TO THE SAUDI </p><p>ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE U.S. PRESENCE IN THE GULF AND TO </p><p>THE "MASSACRE" IN MECCA, AND RAFSANJANI GOES ON TO </p><p>DENOUNCE AT LENGTH THE U.S. PRESENCE AND TO PREDICT ITS </p><p>CERTAIN FAILURE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FINALLY, RAFSANJANI TAKES UP THE "BITTER EVENT" IN </p><p>MAKKAH, DECLARING THAT "THIS WAS SUCH A DIRTY, UGLY, </p><p>ODIOUS AND MONSTROUS ACT THAT WE DO NOT THINK THAT ANY </p><p>OTHER SINISTER ELEMENT SAVE THE GREAT SATAN WOULD BE </p><p>PREPARED TO SOIL ITS HANDS IN THIS...."  HE CLAIMS THAT </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE ISLAMIC WORLD MUSLIMS ARE PROTESTING: </p><p>"HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOW ANGRY.... </p><p>THEY (THE SAUDIS) HAVE NOW SENSED THIS; THEY SUDDENLY </p><p>INSTRUCTED THAT 100 OF THOSE PRINCES..INDULGING </p><p>THEMSELVES IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE--RETURN TO SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA."  IN KEEPING WITH HIS THEME AND FRAMEWORK, </p><p>RAFSANJANI SAYS "THE UNITED STATES IS ITSELF </p><p>RESPONSIBLE.....THE DEFEAT OF SAUDI ARABIA WOULD MEAN </p><p>THE DEFEAT OF THE UNITED STATES, SINCE SAUDI ARABIA IS </p><p>ITS MOST IMPORTANT BASE IN THE REGION.  THE UNITED </p><p>STATES HURT ITSELF AND SAUDI ARABIA BY THIS ACT." </p><p>RAFSANJANI ALSO CHARGED THAT THE SAG WAS FUNDING A </p><p>PRO-REAGAN PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN IN THE U.S. TO HELP REAGAN </p><p>RECOVER POLITICAL POPULARITY LOST BECAUSE OF EVENTS IN </p><p>THE GULF (REF. 3.).  OTHER RECENT IRANIAN CHARGES </p><p>INCLUDE THE SAG\'S IMPRISONING OF ITS OWN SOLDIERS FOR </p><p>REFUSING "TO SHOOT AT HAJJ PILGRIMS DURING THE MASSACRE </p><p>IN MAKKAH."  THE IRANIANS ALSO HAVE CALLED FOR THE </p><p>SAUDIS TO RELINQUISH CONTROL OVER MAKKAH AND MEDINA, THE </p><p>CENTERS OF THE ANNUAL MUSLIM PILGRIMAGE AND HAVE QUOTED </p><p>HIZBOLLAH MEMBERS FROM LEBANON CALLING FOR THE OVERTHROW </p><p>OF THE SAG.  SAUDI CONTACTS ALSO REPORT HEARING IRANIAN </p><p>RADIO BROADCASTS IN ARABIC DENOUNCING THE SAG FOR </p><p>RECEIVING U.S. CONGRESSMAN STEPHEN SOLARZ. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE SAUDIS FOR THEIR PART HAVE LAUNCHED THEIR OWN </p><p>RHETORICAL AND DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVES AGAINST IRAN. </p><p>THERE HAVE BEEN DAILY ARTICLES, PHOTOGRAPHS AND </p><p>EDITORIALS:  FRONT PAGE DISPLAYS OF CONFISCATED WEAPONS </p><p>FROM MAKKAH (MOSTLY SCISSORS, NAIL FILES AND LARGE </p><p>KITCHEN KNIVES); ARTICLES ACCUSING THE IRANIANS OF </p><p>WORSHIPING KHOMEINI, NOT GOD; CLAIMS TO HAVE DOCUMENTED </p><p>IRANIAN INTENTIONS TO SEIZE CONTROL OF THE GRAND </p><p>MOSQUE;  INTERVIEWS WITH SAUDI OFFICIALS (E.G. THE </p><p>DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SECURITY AND HIS BOSS MINISTER OF </p><p>INTERIOR NAYIF); EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF IRANIAN </p><p>BARBARITY IN MECCA; AND EXTENSIVE, SOMETIMES ALMOST </p><p>LURID PLAY ON THE ATTACKS ON THE SAUDI, KUWAITI AND </p><p>OTHER EMBASSIES IN TEHRAN.  THE DEATH OF SAUDI POLITICAL </p><p>ATTACHE IN TEHRAN MUSA\'ID AL-GHAMDI SUPPLIED AN </p><p>IMPORTANT PART OF THE BATTLE OF RHETORIC THE PAST WEEK: </p><p>IN BOLD HEADLINES AUGUST 19 THE ARABIC NEWSPAPER </p><p>AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT DEMANDED THAT IRAN\'S RULERS BE PUT TO </p><p>TRIAL FOR AL-GHAMDI\'S DEATH.  THE IRANIANS RESPONDED </p><p>THAT THE SAUDIS HAD PREVENTED AL-GHAMDI FROM RECEIVING </p><p>THE MEDICAL TREATMENT HE NEEDED, WHILE THE SAUDIS SAID </p><p>THE IRANIANS HAD REFUSED TO ALLOW THEM TO MEDEVAC </p><p>AL-GHAMDI SO HE COULD GET THE NEEDED TREATMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE THEMES OF THE SAUDI OFFENSIVE, AS THEY HAVE </p><p>EMERGED IN STATEMENTS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED (INCLUDING IN </p><p>THE EMBASSY\'S PAST THREE YEARS\' HAJJ REPORTING) ARE </p><p>SEVERAL.  ONE OFT-REPEATED THEME IS THAT POLITICS MUST </p><p>BE CONDUCTED TO SERVE ISLAM AND ITS PRACTICES AND RITES, </p><p>WHEREAS THE ABUSE OF ISLAM AND ITS RITES TO SERVE </p><p>POLITICAL PURPOSES IS IMPIOUS.  THIS THEME IS AMPLIFIED </p><p>AND SUPPORTED BY CONSTANT ATTACKS ON IRANIAN BEHAVIOR </p><p>AND ACTIONS AS NOT ONLY UNISLAMIC BUT AS IN </p><p>CONTRAVENTION OF SPECIFIC ISLAMIC INJUNCTIONS.  THIS HAS </p><p>BEEN REPEATED IN THE STATEMENT OF THE SAUDI ULEMA </p><p>(PREVIOUSLY REPORTED), IN CITATIONS OF AL-AZHAR AND </p><p>ISLAMIC AUTHORITIES OF SEVERAL NATIONS, AND IN ANGRY </p><p>COMMENTARIES AND EDITORIALS.  KHOMEINI IS ANATHEMATIZED </p><p>AS THE TRUE SPIRITUAL HEIR OF THE KILLERS OF ALI AND OF </p><p>THE PROPHET\'S GRANDSON HUSSEIN, A LATTER-DAY PROPONENT </p><p>OF THE ZUNJ AND OF THE QARMATI SCHISMATICS, AN EXPONENT </p><p>OF DEVIATION (BID\'A), LEADING THE FAITHFUL TO </p><p>HELL-FIRE.  DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MECCA EVENTS BY </p><p>JOURNALISTS AND SAUDI OFFICIALS (CF. REFS B AND C) </p><p>DEPICT THE IRANIANS AS TRYING OVER THE YEARS, IN THE </p><p>FACE OF PATIENT AND RESTRAINED SAUDI EFFORTS TO RESTRAIN </p><p>THEM, TO ENGAGE DURING THE HAJJ RITES IN EXTRANEOUS </p><p>ACTIVITIES HARMFUL TO THE PILGRIMAGE AND ENDANGERING TO </p><p>OTHER PILGRIMS, E.G. LAST YEAR\'S EFFORT BY IRANIAN </p><p>PILGRIMS TO SMUGGLE A LARGE QUANTITY OF PLASTIC </p><p>EXPLOSIVES INTO THE KINGDOM.  THIS YEAR\'S </p><p>EVENTS--DEPICTED AS A WELL-PLANNED AND PREPARED </p><p>PROVOCATION--ARE PAINTED AS HAVING EXHAUSTED THE SAG\'S </p><p>AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD\'S PATIENCE AND FORCED THE SAG AND </p><p>OTHER MUSLIMS TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT HOW TO CONTROL </p><p>IRAN\'S INCORRIGIBLE AND DANGEROUS TROUBLEMAKING.  IRAN\'S </p><p>FANATICAL AND STUBBORN INSISTENCE ON SUCH BEHAVIOR ON </p><p>THE PILGRIMAGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EQUALLY STUBBORN </p><p>INSISTENCE ON CONTINUING A WAR THAT ALL RESPONSIBLE </p><p>PARTIES KNOW MUST END AND THAT IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF HARM </p><p>TO THE ISLAMIC WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IRANIAN INTRANSIGENCE, DESTRUCTIVENESS AND UNISLAMIC </p><p>BEHAVIOR, IN BOTH THE MECCA EVENTS AND THE GULF WAR, </p><p>ALSO FORM THE THEMES OF THE EMERGING SAUDI DIPLOMATIC </p><p>OFFENSIVE.  THROUGHOUT THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC WORLDS IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, THE SAUDIS APPEAR TO HAVE ENGAGED IN A </p><p>DELUGE OF INFORMATION ACTIVITY (NOTABLY DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>VIDEOTAPES) AND ARM-TWISTING, AT TIMES MAKING A </p><p>SUPPORTIVE REACTION WITH REGARD TO THE MECCA RIOTS A </p><p>TOUCHSTONE OF BILATERAL RELATIONS.  THIS EFFORT IS </p><p>DIRECTED AT TWO ENDS:  TO ISOLATE IRAN IN THE ISLAMIC </p><p>WORLD (AND CREATE AT LEAST THE THREAT OF SEVERE </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON IRANIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE PILGIMAGE), </p><p>AND TO GENERATE GREATER SUPPORT FOR UNSC AND OTHER </p><p>ACTIVITIES TO PRESSURE IRAN TO END THE GULF WAR. </p><p> </p><p>9.  WHILE FONMIN SAUD IN TUNIS DID NOT, IN OUR </p><p>UNDERSTANDING, "CALL FOR" THE ARABS TO BREAK RELATIONS </p><p>WITH IRAN, IT IS CLEAR FROM HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS BEFORE </p><p>AND DURING THE ARAB LEAGUE MINISTERIAL THAT THIS IS AN </p><p>EVENTUALITY THAT SAUD DID WANT TO RAISE AND WANTS IRAN </p><p>TO BEGIN CONTEMPLATING.  IN HIS ARRIVAL STATEMENT SAUD </p><p>SPECIFICALLY AVERRED THAT IRAN\'S "ACTIONS AGAINST THE </p><p>EMBASSIES OF THE KINGDOM AND KUWAIT AND OTHER EMBASSIES </p><p>CONFIRMS THAT THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE RULES </p><p>AND PRINCIPLES OF DIPLOMATIC ACTION." (REF E).  WHILE </p><p>THE ROLE SAUD PLAYED IN THE MEETING WAS AGGRESSIVE (AND </p><p>SAUDI DIPLOMACY IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN THIS VEIN), WE </p><p>BELIEVE THE SAUDI GOAL WAS NOT TO ACHIEVE A BREAK IN </p><p>ARAB RELATIONS WITH IRAN BUT TO CREATE THE THREAT.  (THE </p><p>SAUDIS ARE REALISTS AND UNDERSTAND THE LINEUP OF THE </p><p>PLAYERS.)  THE COMBINATION OF DISCUSSING A HARSH DRAFT </p><p>RESOLUTION, ADOPTING A MILDER ONE, AND DECIDING TO </p><p>RECONVENE IN A MONTH GENERATES PRESSURE ON BOTH SYRIA </p><p>AND IRAN.  IT ALSO PROVIDES SYRIA A JUSTIFICATION FOR </p><p>ACCEPTING THE RESOLUTION THAT WAS ACTUALLY PASSED, WHICH </p><p>IN FACT APPEARS TO GIVE THE SAUDIS WHAT THEY WANTED FROM </p><p>THIS MEETING:  SUPPORT FOR ENFORCEMENT OF UNSC RES. 598, </p><p>AND FOR SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENT:  THE SAUDI PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN IS </p><p>UNPRECEDENTED IN ITS EXPLICTNESS, ITS INTENSITY AND ITS </p><p>DURATION.  SINCE THE VIOLENT CLASHES IN MAKKAH BETWEEN </p><p>IRANIAN PILGRIMS AND SAG SECURITY FORCES,  IRAN HAS YET </p><p>TO BE ABSENT FROM THE FRONT PAGE HEADLINES OF THE SAUDI </p><p>PRESS.  SAUDI DIPLOMACY, TOO, IS UNACCUSTOMEDLY </p><p>HIGH-PROFILE AND SHOWS SIGNS OF CONTINUING TO BE SO. </p><p>WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE SAG MAY TIRE OF ALL THIS </p><p>ACTIVITY AND CONFRONTATION, WE DOUBT THAT THIS WILL </p><p>HAPPEN UNLESS THE IRANIANS CHANGE COURSE AND OFFER THE </p><p>SAG AMPLE SPACE AND EXCUSE TO EASE UP.  THE PROVOCATIONS </p><p>AND THE STAKES, IN THE SAG PERSPECTIVE, HAVE BEEN AND </p><p>ARE UNUSUALLY GRAVE.  THE CHALLENGE TO SAUDI </p><p>CUSTODIANSHIP OF THE SHRINES AT MECCA AND MEDINA IS FAR </p><p>TOO SERIOUS AN ISSUE FOR THE SAG TO RISK LOSING BY </p><p>DEFAULT IN ISLAMIC OPINION.  FURTHER, SAG CONCERN AT THE </p><p>THREAT POSED BY THE GULF WAR HAS STEADILY GROWN, AND </p><p>WITH IT SAUDI DETERMINATION TO PUSH HARD FOR AN END TO </p><p>THE WAR.  THE SAG SEES IN THE MECCA EVENTS AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FURTHER TO ISOLATE IRAN AND TO CREATE </p><p>GREATER INTERNATIONAL MOMENTUM FOR ACTION BY THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>11.  ON THE HOME FRONT THE SAG SEES THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>PUTTING IRAN IN THE POSITION OF WEAKENED DEMANDEUR WITH </p><p>REGARD TO FUTURE HAJJ ARRANGEMENTS.  WITH THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OR ALL SAUDI DIPLOMATS MAY BE </p><p>WITHDRAWN FROM TEHRAN AND HINTS ABROAD OF SOME FORM OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC APPROVAL FOR THE SAUDIS TO </p><p>RESTRICT THE RIGHT OF TROUBLEMAKERS TO MAKE THE HAJJ, </p><p>THE SAUDIS BELIEVE THE IRANIANS WILL ONE DAY NOTE THAT </p><p>THEY MAY FACE THE CHOICE OF CONCILIATING THE SAG OR </p><p>BEING UNABLE, WHETHER FOR FORMAL OR LOGISTICAL REASONS, </p><p>TO SEND MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF PILGRIMS NEXT YEAR.  THUS </p><p>THE SAUDIS SEE THEIR POSITION VIS-A-VIS THE IRANIANS AS </p><p>ESPECIALLY STRONG AT PRESENT, AND ARE SHOWING EVERY SIGN </p><p>OF DETERMINATION TO PRESS THEIR ADVANTAGE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>HORAN </p><p></p></div>
