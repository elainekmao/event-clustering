<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002275 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION BUSH/BLAIR UNDER FIRE; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Blair, Bush terrorism must stop" </p><p>      the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" dedicated </p><p>      its October 12 editorial to ordering the British and </p><p>      American governments to stop meddling in the affairs </p><p>      of other countries.  "We demand that Blair and Bush </p><p>      leave other countries to run their affairs without </p><p>      interference.  All this euphoria to run other nations </p><p>      by remote control should stop," the newspaper </p><p>      directed.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "There is an adage that says a rolling stone </p><p>      gathers no moss.  This sounds true for people like </p><p>      British Prime Minister Tony Blair who appears to be </p><p>      more obsessed with trying to overthrow foreign </p><p>      governments instead of addressing Britain\'s problems. </p><p>      . .  Working together with another rabble-rouser </p><p>      American President, George W. Bush and organizations </p><p>      such as the European Union and the Commonwealth, Blair </p><p>      has sought to isolate Zimbabwe, impose covert </p><p>      sanctions on Harare with a view to forcing people to </p><p>      rebel against the Government. . .  Together with Bush, </p><p>      Blair teamed up with rebel groups and ousted the </p><p>      Taliban administration in Afghanistan in an exercise </p><p>      that left a lot of people dead under the guise of </p><p>      fighting international terrorism.  Now they are </p><p>      itching for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein who they </p><p>      also want ousted. . .  It is ironic that Blair </p><p>      believes his crusade to use military force to remove </p><p>      other heads of states and replacing them with puppets </p><p>      is not terrorism.  According to the Concise Oxford </p><p>      Dictionary a terrorist is, `A person who uses or </p><p>      favors violent and intimidating methods of coercing a </p><p>      government or community.\'  So the British and the </p><p>      American cousins want to fight what they call </p><p>      terrorism through terrorism?  We demand that Blair and </p><p>      Bush leave other countries to run their affairs </p><p>      without interference.  All this euphoria to run other </p><p>      nations by remote control should </p><p>      stop. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
