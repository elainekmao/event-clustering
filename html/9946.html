<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: NEPALI CONGRESS (DEUBA) PARTY ALSO WILL NOT </p><p>JOIN CURRENT GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KATHMANDU 1419 (B) KATHMANDU 1486 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  In a meeting with former Prime Minister </p><p>Deuba on August 7, Ambassador Malinowski reiterated U.S. </p><p>concerns over recent Maoist activity in Nepal and stressed </p><p>the need for the King, government and political parties to </p><p>join forces against the Maoist threat.  Deuba replied that </p><p>his party -- a splinter faction of the Nepali Congress party </p><p>-- would not join Prime Minister Thapa\'s government, although </p><p>he did not preclude informal participation in the peace </p><p>talks.  Deuba admitted that his party could join the </p><p>government if the previous parliament were reinstated or </p><p>under an all-party government led by CPN-UML Chairman Madhav </p><p>Nepal, Nepali Congress founding father Krishna Prasad </p><p>Bhattarai or other unnamed leaders who had a direct </p><p>connection with the last Parliament.  Deuba also expressed </p><p>concern that European donor governments were supporting only </p><p>leftist NGOs, many of which are sympathetic to the Maoist </p><p>cause, he said.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On August 7, Ambassador Malinowski met with former </p><p>Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, Chairman of the Nepali </p><p>Congress splinter party, to express concern over recent </p><p>Maoist activities and to encourage the democratic forces to </p><p>unite against the Maoist threat.  The Ambassador appreciated </p><p>Deuba\'s public statements pressuring the Maoists to return to </p><p>a third round of talks.  However, he was concerned that the </p><p>cease-fire would not last, especially without the </p><p>participation of the political parties. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Deuba replied that under no conditions would his party </p><p>join Prime Minister Thapa\'s government.  He suggested that </p><p>the King clearly had not reconciled himself to acting only </p><p>within his constitutionally-granted powers, arguing that </p><p>Nepal\'s constitution does not allow the King to appoint the </p><p>Prime Minister.  Deuba stood by the five agitating parties\' </p><p>18-point agenda agreed to on July 4 demanding, among other </p><p>things, reinstatement of the Parliament and establishment of </p><p>parliamentary authority over the national army.  If the King </p><p>cannot agree with the parties\' demands, how could he possibly </p><p>agree with the Maoists\' demands, asked Deuba. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Deuba agreed that ongoing Maoist activity in violation </p><p>of the cease-fire code of conduct was of great concern.  He </p><p>acknowledged that the Maoists have continued to collect huge </p><p>sums of money, to import arms and ammunition and have managed </p><p>to gain concessions from the GON while giving nothing in </p><p>return.  However, Deuba did not see an immediate solution to </p><p>the Maoist problem.  The Ambassador suggested that perhaps </p><p>the parties could work informally with the government\'s </p><p>negotiating team to provide input and help shape the contours </p><p>of a settlement.  Deuba responded that the King must first </p><p>compromise with the parties if he truly wants their </p><p>participation in the government and in the peace talks. </p><p>However, Deuba did not preclude outright his party\'s informal </p><p>participation in the government\'s negotiations with the </p><p>Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Deuba reiterated his party\'s position that it would </p><p>not join Prime Minister Thapa\'s government.  The King had </p><p>missed the opportunity to gain the support of the political </p><p>parties, he said, when the King rejected their consensus </p><p>candidate for Prime Minister, UML leader Madhav Nepal.  Deuba </p><p>suggested, however, that his party could participate in the </p><p>government if either the previous parliament were reinstated </p><p>(with himself as Prime Minister) or an all-party government </p><p>was chosen with Madhav Nepal as Prime Minister.  Deuba also </p><p>averred that he could accept K.P. Bhattarai, an elder </p><p>statesman and founding father of the Nepali Congress, as </p><p>Prime Minister. (Note.  Recent rumors suggest that Bhattarai </p><p>could become candidate for Prime Minister if Thapa is asked </p><p>to resign, with the support of many political leaders, </p><p>including G.P. Koirala and Sher Bahadur Deuba.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Deuba noted the Maoists\' increased anti-American </p><p>rhetoric in recent days and suggested that the Maoists had </p><p>not targeted European countries because of the European\'s </p><p>willingness to deal with the insurgents.  He complained that </p><p>most European donor governments worked only with left-leaning </p><p>NGOs that were often sympathetic to the Maoist cause.  He </p><p>also complained that many of the expatriate staff of some of </p><p>the European donors were personally from the far left of the </p><p>European political spectrum and that many still viewed the </p><p>Maoists in romantic and unrealistic terms.  Deuba expressed </p><p>concern that this indirect assistance would send the wrong </p><p>message to the Maoists and strengthen their position </p><p>vis-a-vis the government. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
