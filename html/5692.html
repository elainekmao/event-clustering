<p>UNCLAS ROME 000568 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL, IO, EAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, BM, IT, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMESE HUMAN RIGHTS TO BE SUBJECT OF CONFERENCE </p><p>HOSTED BY ITALY </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 243 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1.    MFA UNDER SECRETARY FOR ASIA AND HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>MARGHERITA BONIVER PUBLISHED AN OP-ED IN THE LOCAL JOURNAL </p><p>L\'OPINIONE FEBRUARY 6 STATING THAT THE GOI INTENDS TO HOST A </p><p>CONFERENCE ON BURMESE HUMAN RIGHTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY, WHICH RUNS FROM JULY TO DECEMBER 2003.   IT IS </p><p>UNCLEAR IF THIS IDEA IS AN ELABORATION OF THE CONFERENCE </p><p>PROPOSED REFTEL TO BRING TOGETHER MUSLIM AND WESTERN </p><p>COUNTRIES ON THE BASIS OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>2.    FOLLOWING IS AN INFORMAL TRANSLATION OF THE TEXT OF </p><p>BONIVER\'S ARTICLE. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT.  WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY, EUROPE OFTEN </p><p>ENCOUNTERS MANY OBSTACLES IN FORGING A STANCE SHARED BY ALL </p><p>OF ITS MEMBERS.  RIGHT NOW, IRAQ PROVIDES A DRAMATIC EXAMPLE. </p><p>FORTUNATELY, THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE.  ON BURMA, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, THERE IS A COMMON POSITION.  THE PRESS BLACKOUT </p><p>IMPOSED BY THE MILITARY REGIME THAT RULES MYANMAR HAS CREATED </p><p>A THICK MEDIA FOG OVER ITS INSUFFICIENT RESPECT FOR THE MOST </p><p>BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND ITS VIOLENCE AGAINST THE OPPOSITION. </p><p>DESPITE BOTH GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE AND WIDESPREAD SILENCE, THE </p><p>UNION HAS BEEN ABLE TO EXPRESS A FIRM CONDEMNATION </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY STRICT POLITICAL SANCTIONS THAT AT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, COMPLETELY ISOLATED THE MILITARY JUNTA, </p><p>WHICH HAS BEEN IN POWER FOR MANY YEARS.  AS A MATTER OF FACT, </p><p>IN 1999 (NOTE:  APPEARS TO BE AN ERROR; SHOULD READ 1990  END </p><p>NOTE) FREE ELECTIONS TOOK PLACE, RESULTING IN THE VICTORY OF </p><p>THE NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>NOBEL PEACE PRICE LAUREATE MRS. AUNG SAN SUU KYI.  THE </p><p>ELECTORAL MANDATE WAS NEVER HONORED, AND THE BRAVE LEADER </p><p>(JUST RECENTLY SET FREE) WAS PUT UNDER HOUSE ARREST. </p><p> </p><p>AT THIS POINT, IT IS CLEAR THAT POLITICAL SANCTIONS SHOULD BE </p><p>CONSIDERED INSUFFICIENT.  INDEED, BURMESE ARE NOT ONLY </p><p>EXPERIENCING A LACK OF FREEDOM UNDER A DESPOTIC AND CRUEL </p><p>DICTATORSHIP, BUT ALSO TERRIBLE POVERTY, AN ECONOMY LACKING </p><p>IN RESOURCES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OPIUM), AND A TREMENDOUS </p><p>NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY AIDS. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS, THEREFORE, NECESSARY TO MAKE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION AWARE NOT ONLY OF THE ANCIENT ARCHITECTURAL, </p><p>HISTORICAL, AND CULTURAL TREASURES OF THE COUNTRY, BUT </p><p>ESPECIALLY OF ITS CURRENT PROBLEMS, WHICH TOURISTS ONLY </p><p>BARELY PERCEIVE WITH CARELESS APATHY.  DURING THE RECENT </p><p>ASEAN SUMMIT (THE RECURRING CONFERENCE BETWEEN THE EU AND THE </p><p>TEN COUNTRIES OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA) HELD IN BRUSSELS A FEW DAYS </p><p>AGO, ITALY, WHICH I REPRESENTED, RAISED THE BURMA ISSUE BY </p><p>POINTING TO THE FACT THAT THE POSITION THUS FAR MAINTAINED BY </p><p>THE 15 MEMBERS, IN SPITE OF ITS FIRM DETERMINATION, HAS NOT </p><p>PRODUCED CONCRETE RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>THE BURMESE ARE SUFFERING, ALL FREEDOMS -- EVEN THE MOST </p><p>BASIC ONES -- CONTINUE TO BE DENIED, AND THERE IS NO REASON </p><p>TO ANTICIPATE POSITIVE CHANGE EITHER IN THE SHORT OR MEDIUM </p><p>TERM.  IN OUR OPINION, IT IS TIME TO CHANGE TACK.  WE PROPOSE </p><p>A MORE RESOLUTE INTERVENTION AGAINST THE REGIME BY RELYING ON </p><p>EU JOINT ACTION IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH UN SPECIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE FOR BURMA RAZALI.  THEREFORE, IT IS OUR </p><p>INTENTION TO USE THE PLATFORM OF THE ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY </p><p>DURING THE FORTHCOMING SEMESTER TO ORGANIZE AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EVENT THAT WILL ATTRACT MEDIA ATTENTION TO THE BURMESE </p><p>SITUATION, WHICH IS RARELY ADDRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11 MARKED A WATERSHED AND ELICITED UNANIMOUS </p><p>CONDEMNATION.  IT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO IGNORE, WHETHER </p><p>DUE TO LAZINESS OR CONVENIENCE, TERRIBLE SITUATIONS THAT WE </p><p>KNOW COULD FOSTER TERRORISM.  THE HARDSHIPS AND ISOLATION OF </p><p>ANY COUNTRY, AT ANY LATITUDE, CAN NO LONGER BE NEGLECTED: </p><p>NOBODY IS SAFE FROM THE THREAT OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p>2003ROME00568 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
