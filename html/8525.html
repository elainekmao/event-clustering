<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001596 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/CIP AJILLSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECPS, Communication </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA SUPPORTS U.S. POSITIONS FOR WORLD </p><p>RADIOCOMMUNICATION CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 146062 </p><p> </p><p>1. Canada will support U.S positions on Agenda items 1.5 and </p><p>1.24 at the World Radiocommunication Conference.  According </p><p>to Industry Canada\'s Director for Terrestrial Engineering </p><p>Doug Sward, Canada has been on board with these two issues </p><p>throughout their preparations for the Conference.  Sward will </p><p>join Industry Canada\'s Director General for Spectrum Engineer </p><p>Bob McCaughern, who is already in Geneva, at the WRC. </p><p> </p><p>2. Despite their support, Sward stated that the GOC did not </p><p>agree with the U.S. suggestion that technical and operating </p><p>restrictions on the mobile devices used in wireless access </p><p>systems proposed in Agenda item 1.5 would protect radar </p><p>operations and systems in the earth exploration satellite </p><p>service.  A Canadian study, which is supported by results </p><p>from the EU, indicates that the restrictions would protect </p><p>air, maritime and ground-based radar, but would only </p><p>mitigate, and not fully protect, radar systems in the earth </p><p>exploration satellite services.  Sward noted that this was </p><p>not a major point since other criteria will protect earth </p><p>exploration satellites, but one that he thought deserved </p><p>clarification. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
