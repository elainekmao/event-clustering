<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000730 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL:  04/28/13 </p><p>TAGS: CE, MV, AGMT, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 66  (04-29-03) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by E. Ashley Wills, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS: PRIME MINISTER\'S RESPONSE TO TIGERS </p><p>-         COMMISSION APPOINTED TO INVESTIGATE KILLINGS </p><p>-         FOLLOW-UP RE INCIDENTS IN EAST </p><p>-         DINNER WITH KEY MINISTER </p><p>-         MORAGODA\'S IDEA RE MODERATE GROUPING </p><p> </p><p>PRIME MINISTER\'S RESPONSE TO TIGERS </p><p>=================================== </p><p>1.  (SBU) We understand that the government is in the </p><p>process of issuing its formal response to the Tigers\' </p><p>April 21 statement announcing their suspension of the </p><p>peace talks.  We\'ll analyze it once we see it.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In other peace process news, the Ministry of </p><p>Defense has announced that it will move military and </p><p>police establishments located in the present "high- </p><p>security zone" within Jaffna city to Jaffna Fort.  (Note: </p><p>The fort, which is hundreds of years old, is located just </p><p>to the west of the city in a sparsely populated area.) </p><p>The announcement said that the move would be completed </p><p>soon.  We also understand that the SLMM (Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission) continues to work with the government </p><p>and the LTTE on sea movements by the Sea Tigers, a topic </p><p>(fatefully) not dealt with in the February 2002 ceasefire </p><p>accord.  As we have mentioned before, this whole subject </p><p>is proving quite controversial with the Opposition in the </p><p>south.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>COMMISSION APPOINTED TO INVESTIGATE KILLINGS </p><p>============================================ </p><p>3.  (SBU) FYI.  Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has </p><p>appointed a three-member committee to probe the recent </p><p>spate of killings of Tamil army informants allegedly by </p><p>the LTTE.  The committee is expected to prepare a report </p><p>on the killings within a week.  The formation of the </p><p>committee was sparked by the latest killing, which took </p><p>place in greater Colombo on April 26.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOW-UP RE INCIDENTS IN EAST </p><p>============================== </p><p>4. (SBU) In yesterday\'s o/i, we mentioned two violent </p><p>incidents that took place in the eastern town of Arugam </p><p>Bay, Ampara District, in the past couple of weeks.  In </p><p>one of the incidents, three tourists were injured (two </p><p>Germans, one Israeli). We still don\'t have complete </p><p>information on exactly what occurred and who is to blame. </p><p>As we noted, there are contradictory reports that the </p><p>attacks were somehow "business-related" -- or perhaps </p><p>linked to Muslim extremists.  We\'ll report more once we </p><p>dig out more concrete info.  (POL/RSO) </p><p> </p><p>DINNER WITH KEY MINISTER </p><p>======================== </p><p>5. (C) FYI. Please also pass to INR/NESA:  Ambassador </p><p>Wills dined with Minister of Power and Energy Karu </p><p>Jayasuriya last night, April 28.  Jayasuriya, who is the </p><p>deputy leader of the UNP, said he had no plans to join </p><p>the Opposition (contrary to a report we had recently </p><p>picked up from former FM Kadirgamar).  In fact, </p><p>Jayasuriya underscored his total allegiance to the PM and </p><p>said he thought the UNP government was quite strong. </p><p>(Note: If Jayasuriya ever did bolt, it would be a </p><p>crushing blow to the UNP.  Jayasuriya is very important </p><p>for the UNP due to his ability to get out the Sinhalese </p><p>Buddhist vote for the party.  He is also from Gampaha </p><p>District, a populous area northeast of Colombo, and has </p><p>played a key role in challenging the president and her </p><p>family in their home base there.)  During the course of </p><p>the dinner, the minister and his wife also revealed </p><p>themselves to be fervent devotees of Indian mystic Sai </p><p>Baba.  They further went on to say that they see visions </p><p>and have premonitions.  (Note:  All the visions and </p><p>premonitions may have something to do with the fact that </p><p>the power in the Power Minister\'s house went out twice </p><p>through the course of the evening!)  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>MORAGODA\'S IDEA RE MODERATE GROUPING: </p><p>===================================== </p><p>6.  (C) Based on the telephone conversation between DAS </p><p>Camp and the Ambassador today, we will await further </p><p>instructions on how to proceed re Minister Moragoda\'s </p><p>idea that moderate states form some sort of counter to </p><p>NAM.  Please see our April 21 o-i (Colombo 685) on this </p><p>very issue.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
