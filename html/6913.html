On 26 March, five members of the USAID/DART drove from </p><p>Kuwait City to Umm Qasr, Iraq to assess the prevailing </p><p>security and to examine the damage to port infrastructure. </p><p>Umm Qasr has an estimated population of 40,000 people and </p><p>two port areas.  Currently, there is no electricity or </p><p>running water in Umm Qasr and fuel is scarce.  Electricity </p><p>and potable water are provided from Basra, Iraq\'s second- </p><p>largest city.  The focus of the DART assessment was the old </p><p>port area since the new port area is still considered </p><p>insecure.  This is the first assessment in Iraq conducted by </p><p>a U.S. Government agency other than the U.S. military.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Umm Qasr is Iraq\'s southernmost port community, home to </p><p>more than 40,000 Iraqis.  The port was one of the conduits </p><p>for the Oil for Food Program and has the capacity to receive </p><p>sea freight bulk grain shipments.  The port is divided into </p><p>a new port and old port with the capacity to receive ships </p><p>of 9.5 meter draft.  The purpose of this assessment trip was </p><p>to determine if military forces were able to protect unarmed </p><p>humanitarian workers bringing food and supplies to alleviate </p><p>critical needs within Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>PORT FACILITIES </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DART assessment team found that very little of the </p><p>old port infrastructure had been damaged or destroyed. </p><p>Ample warehouses, vacuum systems, vacuators, silos, silo </p><p>chutes, and some cranes appeared to be in good condition, </p><p>but the operational status of mechanical components was not </p><p>assessed due to a lack of electrical power.  No bulk carrier </p><p>ships remained in the old port area and most likely departed </p><p>immediately prior to the start of the conflict.  Off-loading </p><p>of ships will be less problematic once electricity and fuel </p><p>are available, however, no heavy trucks for transport were </p><p>seen in the port area. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Port Authority building is in completely serviceable </p><p>condition with limited, superficial damage.  The </p><p>Harbormaster\'s office was ransacked, however, and no </p><p>important logs or papers were found by the DART. </p><p>The warehouses along the port are made of corrugated metal </p><p>and labeled in both English and Arabic. </p><p>5.  The warehouses are empty, except for 200 bags of sugar </p><p>and salt, which have not yet been tested to determine </p><p>suitability for consumption.  There are also a substantial </p><p>number of trucking containers stored in the port.  Some </p><p>looting occurred within the eight grain silos but the silos </p><p>were not destroyed. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The railroads that lead to the dockyards do not seem to </p><p>be used.  There are three train engines located at the port, </p><p>and two of those are shunting engines, which appear new. </p><p>However, despite local reports that all the engines work, </p><p>the thick dust covering them, as well as the rust and dirt </p><p>covering the rails, indicate the engines have not moved for </p><p>some time. </p><p> </p><p>7.  There is a dredger in the water, which appears to be new </p><p>and in working order.  There are also two tugboats in </p><p>similar condition as well as pilot vessels.  None of the </p><p>vessels have yet been inspected. </p><p> </p><p>8.  There has been a positive response from local workers in </p><p>regard to employment at the port, and former workers have </p><p>been requested to return with lists of the critical skills, </p><p>components, and individuals necessary to reconstitute the </p><p>port.  The response has been forthcoming and accurate to </p><p>date. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The DART counted five vacuators.  One was clearly </p><p>damaged; an air tank had been punctured, and a large hole </p><p>was visible on the side.  The other four units appeared to </p><p>have been recently used.  The engine cabinets were </p><p>padlocked, which would suggest that the motors may not have </p><p>been sabotaged, but the location of the keys is unknown. </p><p>The motors have not been inspected for improved explosive </p><p>devices. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Potable water and electricity were listed as the </p><p>immediate concerns by the local population, both of which </p><p>come from Basra.  Until power and water are restored, the </p><p>port will not be able to operate at full capacity. </p><p>As an immediate solution, there is a plan to lay a pipeline </p><p>extending from Kuwait over the Iraqi border to provide </p><p>potable water for treatment within Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The British vessel, the Sir Galahad, is due in Umm Qasr </p><p>on 27 March, and the U.K. forces are looking for twenty port </p><p>workers to assist in offloading the humanitarian supplies. </p><p>The port is projected to receive 90 truckloads of </p><p>humanitarian aid in the next two to three days, and there </p><p>are plans for receiving 780 pallets of food and water.  The </p><p>U.K. forces have some trucks to move the commodities into </p><p>one of the warehouses at the port.  A list of commodities is </p><p>available at the HOC. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>UMM QASR HOSPITAL AND LOCAL SCHOOLS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  The DART was unable to assess the Umm Qasr hospital </p><p>because it remains in an insecure area.  However, the </p><p>hospital reportedly has a three-month supply of medicine and </p><p>an English-speaking doctor but no running water.  Iraqi </p><p>water tankers were observed on the road but the DART was not </p><p>able to immediately determine how this water was being used </p><p>or where it was being taken.  Although there are between 20- </p><p>30 local schools in the Umm Qasr area, none have reopened </p><p>since the conflict began on 20 March. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
