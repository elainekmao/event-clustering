(C) SUMMARY: Since October 2002, Post has actively </p><p>engaged the GON in hopes of concluding an Article 98 </p><p>agreement before July 1, 2003.  President Obasanjo has </p><p>indicated a willingness to conclude an agreement; however </p><p>key figures such as the Foreign Affairs and Justice </p><p>Ministers have opposed an agreement.  Minister of Defense </p><p>Danjuma, an important Obasanjo insider, has been </p><p>ambivalent.  With the end of the first Obasanjo </p><p>Administration in May, many of our senior interlocutors are </p><p>no longer in office.  Filling their vacant positions might </p><p>take more time than we can afford at this point.  Thus our </p><p>strategy will be to raise this issue again with President </p><p>Obasanjo, reiterating the consequences to our military </p><p>assistance package if there is no Article 98 agreement. </p><p>This time we will raise the issue in writing, in stark </p><p>terms, pointing out the consequences if the July 1 deadline </p><p>is not met.  Post will also seek to press the Permanent </p><p>Secretaries in the crucial Ministries about the need to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>conclude the agreement before July.  In the meantime, Post </p><p>will continue to work with the GON to commit security </p><p>assistance funds prior to July 1.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Post began approaching senior GON officials about </p><p>Article 98 last year.  Since then, we have raised the issue </p><p>on multiple occasions with President Obasanjo, Vice </p><p>President Atiku, Minister of Defense Danjuma, Minister of </p><p>Justice Agabi, National Security Advisor Mohammed and other </p><p>senior members of the Obasanjo government.  In February, </p><p>President Obasanjo told Ambassador Jeter he would form an </p><p>inter-ministerial committee under the direction of then </p><p>Foreign Minister Sule Lamido to examine the issue (REF E). </p><p>(COMMENT: In his discussion with us, Lamido voiced strong </p><p>opposition to Article 98.  We are unaware of the findings </p><p>of this "inter-ministerial committee" or if it ever met. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) During a May 12 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Minister for Defense Danjuma expressed serious doubts about </p><p>the prospects for Nigeria signing an Article 98 agreement. </p><p>Danjuma commented that he did not think Nigeria would sign </p><p>an Article 98 agreement because it "usually follows South </p><p>Africa on such matters" and noted the measure would surely </p><p>be opposed by Foreign Minister Lamido.  Danjuma expressed </p><p>philosophical misgivings about Article 98, however, in </p><p>apparent recognition of the benefit it would provide </p><p>Nigerian soldiers and not wanting our security assistance </p><p>program to be truncated due to this issue, he said he would </p><p>try to persuade President Obasanjo to sign the agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) During two meetings last month, Obasanjo told </p><p>Ambassador Jeter that he wanted an Article 98 agreement and </p><p>that an interagency ministerial would consider the issue </p><p>prior to his May 29 inaugural.  The President\'s Special </p><p>Advisor on International Affairs told us the meeting took </p><p>place but he was not informed of its decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Concluding an Article 98 agreement before July 1 </p><p>will be further complicated by the ministerial vacancies </p><p>created by the termination of the first Obasanjo </p><p>administration.  Until the President fills the vacant </p><p>appointments, the ministries will be headed by Permanent </p><p>Secretaries.  The PermSecs are aware of the deadline, but </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>they may be reluctant to show any initiative on this </p><p>sensitive issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) DAO received instructions on June 4 from USEUCOM to </p><p>deliver a letter to Chief of Defense Staff ADM Ogohi from </p><p>EUCOM Deputy Commander GEN Wald asking for the Ogohi\'s </p><p>assistance in garnering an Article 98 agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Given the time constraints and the current senior </p><p>level vacancies in the GON, our strategy can only be a </p><p>streamlined, two-step approach.  First, we will raise the </p><p>issue again with President Obasanjo in a letter as well as </p><p>seeking an audience with him, clearly detailing the </p><p>ramifications of not concluding an agreement in time. </p><p>Second, we also will press the key PermSecs (Defense and </p><p>MFA) to see if we can get them to move the process forward. </p><p>(NOTE: We appreciate the EUCOM letter to ADM Ogohi. </p><p>However, ADM Ogohi has just submitted his letter of </p><p>resignation.  Instead, we will deliver the letter to the </p><p>Acting Chief of Defense Staff LTG Ogumudia.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) In the meantime, Post will continue to work with </p><p>the GON in order to commit the $5.6 million in remaining in </p><p>Foreign Military Finance (FMF) before July 1.  Due to Sec </p><p>557 sanctions, Nigeria\'s FMF credits can only be used on </p><p>existing Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs.  Upon </p><p>review of Nigeria\'s FMS program we propose the following </p><p>allocations to obligate $2.9 million in FMF: </p><p>      a. Extend the MPRI Simulation Center program for an </p><p>      additional 12 months.  The ODC has allocated FMF </p><p>      funds to support a three-year contract with MPRI to </p><p>      train and manage the Nigerian JCATS Simulation </p><p>      Center in Jaji ($1.6 mil). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>      b. Fully fund the C-130 training case ($500k). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>      c. Reactivate the expired LOA for the C-130 </p><p>      publications case ($75k). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>      d. Receive and sign the LOA for the transfer of the </p><p>      USCG Sassafras, ($800k). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) On Monday June 2 ODC briefed Ministry of Defense </p><p>Director of Joint Services B.O. Willams on the proposed </p><p>course of action and asked the MOD to quickly execute the </p><p>necessary documents to apportion and commit these funds. </p><p>ODC has yet to receive any LORs or other requested memos. </p><p>Joint Services had promised to transmit the necessary </p><p>documentation to us by June 9.  Consequently, we will have </p><p>to work very quickly to generate, process, and sign the </p><p>LOAs needed to commit these funds by July 1.  It is </p><p>possible that we will not be able to complete them all. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT: Post has made an active, sustained effort </p><p>to urge the GON to sign an Article 98 agreement.  We have </p><p>raised this several times with President Obasanjo and all </p><p>relevant Ministers.  We will approach Obasanjo as well the </p><p>Ministries again.  While Obasanjo has expressed a positive </p><p>inclination, there is noticeable opposition within the </p><p>Nigerian bureaucracy.  At this point, we cannot say whether </p><p>Nigeria will even sign, much less sign in time.  These are </p><p>open questions.  We will do the best we can but ultimately </p><p>the buck stops at Obasanjo\'s desk.  We will remind him once </p><p>again, in stark terms, of the consequences of a failure to </p><p>conclude an Article 98 agreement.  The Department may also </p><p>want to consider a letter from Secretary Powell to </p><p>President Obasanjo urging that Nigeria execute the Article </p><p>98 agreement.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
