The Executive Director of WFP met with ORHA staff in </p><p>Baghdad on 13 May.  The primary discussion point was WFP\'s </p><p>plan for purchasing the local harvest.  WFP has set aside </p><p>USD 42 million for the purchase of approximately 100,000 MT </p><p>wheat in the north.  DART held follow-up conversations with </p><p>WFP regarding the mechanics of making an additional local </p><p>purchase.  WFP is willing to pursue a purchase to fill the </p><p>remaining wheat deficit in its Emergency Operation, as well </p><p>as assist in the purchase of the entire harvest.  Pre- </p><p>requisites for this action are a functioning Grain Board and </p><p>a way to move money around in a secure environment.  WFP is </p><p>preparing a proposal to the U.N. Office of Iraq Programs in </p><p>New York to make the purchase.  FAO also plans to purchase </p><p>4,000 MT of wheat seed in the north and is willing to </p><p>discuss possibilities of purchasing some barley in </p><p>south/central.  A summary of the week\'s discussions follows. </p><p>No firm decisions have yet been made, but parties are </p><p>drawing nearer to final steps.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>WFP\'S JAMES MORRIS MEETS ORHA </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Executive Director of the U.N. World Food Program </p><p>(WFP) James Morris met with members of the Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) on 11 May </p><p>in Baghdad.  WFP Regional Director Khaled Adly and Country </p><p>Director Torben Due were also present.  ORHA staff included </p><p>George Ward, Robin Raphel, Susan Hamrock, Frank Ostrander, </p><p>Richard Wilcox, and DART Food Officer Regina Davis. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Ward opened the meeting by saying how crucial WFP\'s work </p><p>is to the success of the revival of the Public Distribution </p><p>System (PDS), and asked that WFP notify ORHA about </p><p>obstacles.  After introductions, Raphel immediately asked </p><p>WFP about its plans for purchasing wheat from the upcoming </p><p>harvest. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Morris said that purchasing the local wheat crop was </p><p>important and that WFP needed to do it.  He added that WFP </p><p>was thinking that the wheat flour requirements for months 5 </p><p>and 6 of its extended Emergency Operation could likely be </p><p>filled by the wheat purchase.  Morris also asked ORHA for </p><p>assistance in securing the warehouses, silos, and mills. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Raphel replied that the military/ORHA relationship was </p><p>improving.  In the last week, ORHA had worked with WFP and </p><p>the military to get the GPS (global positioning system) </p><p>coordinates for the silos and warehouses that WFP needed and </p><p>now had almost all the coordinates.  Regarding security, she </p><p>said that the coalition does not have forces to provide </p><p>security all hours of every day.  But she added that ORHA </p><p>was budgeting for a local force to protect these structures. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Raphel said that estimates of the country-wide harvest </p><p>were 1.25 million MT of wheat and 500,000 MT of barley. </p><p>Purchase price estimates are between USD 130 and USD 150 </p><p>million.  In the past, the Government of Iraq (GOI) set the </p><p>selling price for the country, and last year\'s wheat price </p><p>was 155,000 dinars per ton (USD 77.50 at an exchange rate of </p><p>2,000 dinars to the USD).  The barley harvest (primarily </p><p>used for animal feed) began on 17 May, and the wheat harvest </p><p>has already begun in the south.  Raphel clearly stated that </p><p>she hoped that WFP could use Oil for Food (OFF) monies to </p><p>make the purchase. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Adly listed details that needed to be sorted through </p><p>before WFP could proceed with a local purchase: </p><p> </p><p>A.  There is currently no mechanism in place to move money </p><p>around the country. </p><p> </p><p>B.  The Ministry of Trade (MOT) Grain Board had a system in </p><p>place whereby it tested the quality of the wheat, ranked it, </p><p>and weighed it, as well as serving as the purchaser.  The </p><p>Grain Board needs to be involved in this process, but </p><p>requires assistance in getting up and running again. </p><p> </p><p>C.  Pre-war, the GOI kept six months of stocks in its </p><p>National Strategic Reserve (NSR).  A determination now needs </p><p>to be made about how much stock should be kept in the NSR. </p><p> </p><p>D.  The U.N. Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1472 has </p><p>language to accommodate the purchase of local commodities, </p><p>but expires on 3 June.  Therefore, all transactions need to </p><p>be completed by that date.  There is discussion of extending </p><p>it for six months, but no action has yet been taken. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Raphel replied that ORHA was in the process of </p><p>consolidating assets in 25 banks, and found themselves "not </p><p>being as agile, as they would like to be."  She reiterated </p><p>that ORHA planned to give all Iraqi civil servants the USD </p><p>20 payment as a measure to tide themselves over until a </p><p>salary payment system can be established.  Raphel stated </p><p>that a general salary schedule should be issued by the end </p><p>of the week (i.e., by 16 May), and that ORHA was committed </p><p>to paying workers retroactively to when they last got paid. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>WFP THINKING ON THE LOCAL PURCHASE OF THE HARVEST </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>9.  On 15 May, DART Chief Food Officer further discussed the </p><p>details of how such a purchase would take place with WFP\'s </p><p>Adly.  WFP reports that it fully supports measures to re- </p><p>establish a marketing arrangement for the harvest, and </p><p>considers it critical to promoting stability and </p><p>contributing to the kick-start of the economy in general, </p><p>particularly for the rural populations. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Pre-war, the MOT Grain Board maintained a network of </p><p>collection centers spread throughout the production areas </p><p>and procured the grain at fixed prices, taking into </p><p>consideration the inputs provided to the farmers (seed, </p><p>fertilizer and pesticides) at highly subsidized prices. This </p><p>year, the Grain Board Manager reports that due to the war </p><p>and the looting which has taken place at the collection </p><p>centers, farmers have been advised that grain should be </p><p>delivered by the farmers to the MOT warehouses and silos </p><p>directly. </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  The DART subsequently learned that ORHA set the </p><p>price of wheat at USD 80 USD per MT and USD 50 USD per MT </p><p>for barley, but most recent information indicates these </p><p>prices may rise.  ORHA realizes the initial prices are low, </p><p>but is trying to encourage farmers to seek other markets. </p><p>Because of the current wide fluctuations in the exchange </p><p>rates, the DART is concerned that setting low prices will </p><p>leave farmers with little cash to put forward towards buying </p><p>seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides for the planting season, </p><p>forcing them once again to be reliant on subsidies.  DART </p><p>Field Team South reports that in a matter of three days the </p><p>exchange rate dropped in Basrah from 2,000 dinars to one </p><p>USD, to 1,700 dinars to one USD, to 600 dinars to one USD. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>11.  Without a functioning banking system, and the absence </p><p>of a secure working environment for the MOT/Grain Board (GB) </p><p>staff, WFP feels that implementing a program of this </p><p>magnitude will not be possible without assurances of </p><p>security from ORHA and the Coalition.  Secure storage of the </p><p>grain is also a concern. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>LOCAL PURCHASE IN THE THREE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>12.  UNSCR 1472 provides for the use of escrow account funds </p><p>for the procurement of food in Iraq.  WFP has already </p><p>received $42 million from the OFF 13 percent account (the </p><p>account dedicated to projects in the north) with which it </p><p>plans to buy a portion of the harvest in the north, </p><p>approximately 90,000 to 100,000 MT wheat flour.  (Note: </p><p>Estimate for the harvest in the three northern governorates </p><p>is more than 700,000 MT.  End Note.)  Because the monies </p><p>come from the 13 percent account, WFP prefers to buy in the </p><p>three northern governorates and WFP is required to </p><p>distribute the wheat flour purchase in the north under UNSCR </p><p>986.   In the north, WFP reports that it is possible to </p><p>purchase through private sector companies, security </p><p>conditions are more stable, and there is an established </p><p>system of private sector banking arrangements in neighboring </p><p>countries where payments can be deposited. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>LOCAL PURCHASE IN SOUTH/CENTRAL IRAQ </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  For the six-month emergency operation (EMOP) launched </p><p>by WFP to support the PDS, there is a current resource </p><p>shortfall of wheat in the range of 300,000 MT.  Provided </p><p>that there is a further extension of the OFF which is </p><p>currently set to expire on 3 June (UNSCR 1472/76), it is </p><p>WFP\'s intention to procure the shortfall tonnage of 300,000 </p><p>MT wheat through the GB during June/July.  The pre- </p><p>requisites for the transaction are as follows:  OIP releases </p><p>the funds; ORHA authorities re-establish a functioning Grain </p><p>Board; and a way to move money around in a secure </p><p>environment is established.  (Note:  The 300,000 MT would be </p><p>in addition to the 90,000 to 100,000 MT in the north, for a </p><p>total of about 400,000 MT.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>14.  ORHA and WFP are preparing a proposal to OIP requesting </p><p>funds for the purchase of the entire wheat harvest of </p><p>approximately 1.2 million MT.  The funds from OIP would go </p><p>to the farmers, through the Grain Board (GB), for the </p><p>purchase of the entire crop, if the funds are made </p><p>available.  WFP would feed the initial 300,000 MT into the </p><p>PDS under its EMOP.  The remaining 900,000 MT would go to </p><p>the Grain Board as part of the National Strategic Reserve to </p><p>be used at a later date.  GB could decide to feed it into </p><p>the PDS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  In the center/south, the entire system of grain </p><p>procurement was monopolized by the parastatal Grain Board. </p><p>Private sector bulk grain traders did not exist.  As stated </p><p>in paragraph 7B above, WFP insists that a functioning Grain </p><p>Board is necessary to effect the transaction.  To revive the </p><p>GB, the following must be achieved: </p><p> </p><p>--  Rehabilitate the administrative structure of the Grain </p><p>Board by providing a secure working environment and re- </p><p>equipping the Board\'s offices; </p><p> </p><p>--  Ensure back payment of salaries and regular payroll </p><p>implementation; </p><p> </p><p>--  Rehabilitate warehouse and silo equipment such as </p><p>conveyor belts, weighbridges and weighing scales; </p><p> </p><p>--  Provide secure means for funds handling and transfer to </p><p>effect payment to farmers, as well as cover operating costs </p><p>at the receiving centers; and </p><p> </p><p>--  Facilitate an information campaign to inform farmers of </p><p>receiving center locations and method of payment. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Given the above measures, WFP could devise a system to </p><p>track the weight and quality of the grain.  WFP could then </p><p>advance funds to the Grain Board to commence purchasing </p><p>operations.  WFP is also willing to provide superintendence </p><p>(through an oversight firm), survey and monitoring services </p><p>to reconcile payments against receipts over time.  But WFP </p><p>is firm that the Grain Board must be involved in order for </p><p>this to proceed in central/south. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Since barley is not part of the PDS, WFP would have no </p><p>need to purchase barley.  The processes that need to be put </p><p>into place to effect the wheat purchase could also be </p><p>applied to the barley purchase.  To that extent, WFP is </p><p>willing to assist.  See FAO section below regarding the </p><p>barley. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>CURRENT SILO STOCKS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  In addition to the harvest, there are also large </p><p>quantities of wheat in the silos that are part of the NSR. </p><p>These stocks are accumulations from prior harvests.  The </p><p>Central MOT has told WFP there may be one million or more MT </p><p>of wheat in the NSR.  The MOT\'s Grain Board could feed these </p><p>stocks into the PDS in future months.  The MOT is already </p><p>lending some NSR stocks to WFP for the upcoming PDS </p><p>distribution.  In the past, NSR stocks were lent to the PDS, </p><p>and repaid with OFF stocks. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF FAO </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  DART recently heard that the U.N. Organization for Food </p><p>and Agriculture (FAO) had agreed to purchase the barley </p><p>crop, used primarily for animal feed.  DART made some </p><p>inquiries with FAO/HQ and learned the following: </p><p> </p><p>A.  In the current season, FAO was not planning to buy </p><p>barley for livestock feeding.  The only barley procurement </p><p>done by FAO was in 2000, when it procured some 1,700 MT of </p><p>barley that was distributed to drought-affected farmers. </p><p> </p><p>B.  FAO does plan, however, to buy approx 4,000 MT of wheat </p><p>grain for seed use in the three northern governorates.  FAO </p><p>is ready to pay the market price plus a premium to get the </p><p>best quality seed. </p><p> </p><p>C.  FAO has adopted contracts (under the 59 percent account) </p><p>to import approximately 70,000 MT of barley for feed use of </p><p>which some 25,000 MT can be shipped before June 3, the </p><p>expiration date of UNSCR 1672/76. </p><p> </p><p>20.  FAO/HQ told DART Officer Davis that it was willing to </p><p>explore the possibility of buying barley in country but, </p><p>like WFP, would need to request funds from OIP/New York for </p><p>the purchase.  FAO staff from Arbil is to arrive in Baghdad </p><p>21 May and plans to discuss the issue with the U.N. </p><p>Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq, Ramiro Lopes da Silva, and </p><p>with ORHA. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>ALTERNATIVES TO U.N. PURCHASE </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  In a meeting in Basrah on 13 May, the DART asked the </p><p>WFP national staff about options for the farmers if they are </p><p>unable to sell their harvestto the MOT Grain Board.  The </p><p>options given were: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Farmers could probably sell to private mills directly, </p><p>as they were never allowed to do this before.  It is </p><p>important to note that the standard practice in Iraq was to </p><p>mix the higher quality Australian or Russian wheat (OFF </p><p>commodities) with Iraqi wheat in the silos prior to grinding </p><p>it into flour.  Whether or not the mills have the purchasing </p><p>power is unknown. </p><p> </p><p>B.  Farmers could sell to animal farmers for animal feed, </p><p>but the price would be very low (10 to 20 percent of the </p><p>price that the GB is expected to offer). </p><p> </p><p>C.  Farmers could sell to other countries (once sanctions </p><p>are lifted).  Also something they could not do before. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
