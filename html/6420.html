REASON:  1.5 (B & D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Southern civic and media groups have </p><p>diverse views of the coming elections, ranging from </p><p>optimistic anticipation of leadership change to fear of </p><p>ruthless power tactics.  Some analysts predict "bloody" </p><p>elections in Kwara and the South-South states, but relative </p><p>calm in Lagos and elsewhere.  Across the South, the </p><p>increasing frequency and prominence of apparent political </p><p>assassinations has heightened the public\'s nervousness.  None </p><p>of the scenarios for violence include attacks against foreign </p><p>nationals.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>SOUTHERN TENSIONS RISING; IMPUNITY REIGNS SUPREME </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Beyond the on-going societal violence and </p><p>extrajudicial killings, which result in corpses on the </p><p>streets and in the lagoons or rivers of Lagos State, numerous </p><p>prominent Nigerian citizens have been murdered in recent </p><p>months.  Southern Nigerians express universal horror at the </p><p>murders, several of which have taken place in the victims\' </p><p>homes.  While the 2001 case of felled Attorney General Bola </p><p>Ige remains under prosecution, to date no suspects have been </p><p>convicted for politically motivated murders in the post-1999 </p><p>administration.  Over a dozen such murders and additional </p><p>reported attempted murders remain unsolved from the past two </p><p>years.  Whatever the reasons for the stinted administration </p><p>of justice, many Nigerians view the GON as complacent toward </p><p>or impotent against political violence in the South. </p><p>Southern human rights groups have warned poloffs since </p><p>September 2002 that the number of deaths would surely rise as </p><p>elections drew nearer.  This sad prediction is being </p><p>fulfilled, though the reasons behind the violence remain </p><p>hazy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Tensions in the South have increased steadily since </p><p>last fall.  Multiple sources accuse political leaders and </p><p>their supporters of plotting various murders that have taken </p><p>place under suspicious circumstances.  Some candidates appear </p><p>to be wearing bullet-proof vests.  Sources attribute </p><p>assassinations generally to one of two possible motives: a </p><p>major "business deal gone bad" or a political vendetta. </p><p>Ledum Mitee, president of the Movement for the Survival of </p><p>the Ogoni People (MOSOP), says the motive itself is less </p><p>important in explaining the phenomenon of these killings than </p><p>the atmosphere of impunity they generate.  The "real reason </p><p>why it happens," he argues, is the "lack of accountability" </p><p>combined with an "irrational instinct to dominate that comes </p><p>with power."  Political killings may occur if someone </p><p>obsessed with power, or allies, views a person as an </p><p>opponent\'s supporter.  The target may not be the opponent </p><p>directly.  Some politicians are allegedly detaining opponents </p><p>and critics with impunity.  For example, Eni Akinsola of CDHR </p><p>reports that authorities are repeatedly detaining polytechnic </p><p>professor John Okam without charges, allegedly under orders </p><p>by a member of the Cross River State House of Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>FORECAST: MORE VIOLENCE AHEAD </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) POLITICAL KILLINGS, THUGGERY, AND VIGILANTISM. In </p><p>southern Nigeria, persons who initiate violence will usually </p><p>appeal more to ethnic than to religious ties, most sources </p><p>agree.  More dangerous than sporadic societal uprisings, some </p><p>sources claim, are threats by hired thugs.  Southern human </p><p>rights NGOs expect political violence will continue to rise </p><p>throughout the election season.  Many see it as indisputable </p><p>fact that some politicians recruit thugs to influence the </p><p>outcome of elections or other political gatherings.  Other </p><p>politicians, failing to discourage criminal actions by their </p><p>supporters who are seeking to maintain or gain power, </p><p>passively permit such violence.  Members of the Committee for </p><p>the Defense of Human Rights (CDHR), including Eni Akinsola, </p><p>Shina Loremikan, Belo Aideloje, and Ropo Ewenla, described </p><p>first-hand experience they had in university when dominant </p><p>military rulers paid friends to disrupt political and social </p><p>meetings that could undermine the strongman\'s agenda.  The </p><p>same methods are used to affect political agendas in </p><p>democracy today, they claim. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ARMED STUDENTS TO TAKE TO THE STREETS.  Contacts from </p><p>CDHR, MOSOP, the Catholic Secretariat, and the Civil </p><p>Liberties Organization continue to raise allegations with </p><p>poloffs that some candidates actively recruit student </p><p>"cultists" to join street armies and intimidate voters at the </p><p>polls.  Groups such as the Vikings in Rivers and Black Ax in </p><p>Enugu are receiving funds in exchange for their "support." </p><p>Arms are being stockpiled on university campuses, they claim. </p><p> "Students will tell you, \'I\'m for so-and-so,\'" said CDHR\'s </p><p>Eni Akinsola.  "When you ask them, \'Why?\' they\'ll tell you </p><p>simply, \'He\'s my candidate.\'  You know what they mean.  They </p><p>have been paid." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) DEADLY PLACES TO WATCH?  Akinsola and Chukwuma </p><p>Ezeala, national coordinator of the Justice Development and </p><p>Peace Commission (JDPC), predict that roughly half of </p><p>Nigeria\'s states will be violent and half will be peaceful </p><p>come elections.  Kwara\'s capital of Illorin will be "one big </p><p>pool of blood," they say.  "Kwara is anybody\'s game: Lawal, </p><p>Saraki, or Lai Mohammed."  Rivers and Delta will also be </p><p>"very bloody."  Bayelsa and Cross River will have "problems." </p><p> In Akwa Ibom, though the urban centers may be peaceful, the </p><p>villages may endure the "worst potential violence."  They </p><p>expect violence in Ondo and Oyo "because the people there do </p><p>not support the candidates they are bringing, and the PDP </p><p>will win these states at all costs."  Potential hotspots in </p><p>the North include Kano, Kebbi, and especially Katsina, they </p><p>believe.  Kaduna and Plateau will be "dicey."  Borno will be </p><p>interesting because of the balanced strength of competing </p><p>parties, they argue.  Nassarawa may have skirmishes as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>TENTATIVE TRUCES AND "TRANSPARENT RIGGING" </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Lagos will be relatively peaceful, think Akinsola and </p><p>Ezeala, because "the two factions of the OPC have agreed not </p><p>to fight each other here." Representatives of these two </p><p>organizations believe that the OPC may be involved in </p><p>violence elsewhere, namely Kwara, but the police have "agreed </p><p>to allow the OPC to participate in Lagos politics as long as </p><p>no violence is involved."  In Ogun, where the vote is being </p><p>"more transparently rigged--no, \'allocated,\'" voting will be </p><p>relatively peaceful.  Kogi "will be very peaceful, for the </p><p>most part."  In Niger, "the big-wigs won\'t allow their </p><p>domains to deteriorate into violence."  Ekiti "would have </p><p>been a bloody tag team, but the four parties are not fighting </p><p>each other now."  Other states that will not experience </p><p>"much" violence include Osun, Sokoto, Abia, Bauchi, Benue, </p><p>Zamfara, Adamawa, and Gombe.  Anambra will be violent, but to </p><p>a lesser degree than the norm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) RIGGING LEGITIMATELY: WHEN THEY\'LL THROW IN THE </p><p>TOWEL.  "You need to have genuine support in order to rig an </p><p>election," asserted Akinsola.  "If you cross the 30 percent </p><p>threshold of support, then you can rig it to get the </p><p>mandate."  Most rigging, according to Ledum Mitee of the </p><p>Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), does </p><p>not involve the literal "stuffing of the ballot box."  The </p><p>process is less definable than the outcome in some cases. How </p><p>electoral officers are chosen and what they do with the </p><p>resources they are given are important.  Do they make voting </p><p>materials available?  Do they distribute fraudulent ballots? </p><p>To combat rigging and increase the perceived legitimacy of </p><p>election outcomes, several NGOs say, results should be </p><p>announced on site by the local government offices, rather </p><p>than passing the results all the way to Abuja for final </p><p>announcement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT.  Political fears in the South are largely </p><p>by-products of societal clashes between indigenous groups </p><p>(e.g. Warri, Delta State), alleged assassinations, and </p><p>political legitimacy questions (as some candidates across the </p><p>South are reportedly "imposed" on voters without popular </p><p>consent). Despite Obasanjo\'s popularity with many </p><p>Southerners, his recent efforts to shore up political support </p><p>have failed to convince people who feel that the GON has done </p><p>little to engender economic development and social welfare, </p><p>issues repeatedly highlighted as paramount to Southern </p><p>constituents.  The climate remains volatile in pockets across </p><p>the South; moreover, tensions continue to riddle </p><p>relationships between the international oil companies </p><p>operating in the region and the local residents. The </p><p>coincidence of tensions in the Middle East and domestic </p><p>violence in Nigeria is thus making many an expat </p><p>uncomfortable.  Whatever election violence there may be in </p><p>the South is not expected to involve foreign nationals, </p><p>however. Prudence and common sense should help keep foreign </p><p>nationals away from the election fray.  END COMMENT. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
