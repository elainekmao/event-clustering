Papers </p><p>expect the President to wait for the oath-taking ceremony </p><p>before choosing a candidate.  Erdogan said after meeting </p><p>Sezer on Thursday that the new Prime Minister would be a </p><p>trustworthy figure who is known at home and abroad.  Erdogan </p><p>added that Sezer has welcomed the tone of compromise between </p><p>AKP and the opposition CHP.  CHP leader Baykal said after </p><p>being received by Sezer that the President would be in close </p><p>cooperation with both parties in the parliament.  Baykal </p><p>also noted that CHP would support a constitutional amendment </p><p>package which includes removal of political bans, scrapping </p><p>parliamentary immunity and reducing the parliamentary </p><p>election term from five to four years.  The new government </p><p>could be completed before the end of November, reports say. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Leaders on EU: Dailies claim that President Sezer urged </p><p>Baykal to continue cooperation with the AKP on EU accession, </p><p>and said Baykal and Erdogan should accompany him to the EU </p><p>Copenhagen Summit.  Erdogan told the press on Thursday that </p><p>relations with the EU would continue even if Turkey is </p><p>denied a date for membership negotiations at the Copenhagen </p><p>Summit.  Erdogan reportedly briefed EU envoys about his </p><p>party\'s reform pledges: freedom of expression and </p><p>association; changes in political parties law and election </p><p>regulation; an end to torture; facilitation of activities by </p><p>foreign and domestic associations; religious foundations </p><p>will be allowed to purchase real estate; decisions of the </p><p>ECHR will be implemented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Pearson calls on Erdogan: U.S. Ambassador to </p><p>Ankara Robert Pearson paid a courtesy visit to AKP leader </p><p>Erdogan on Thursday, conveying to him congratulation from </p><p>President Bush on AKP\'s election victory, papers report. </p><p>Pearson said the U.S. backed AKP efforts for a breakthrough </p><p>in ties with the EU, in economic and democratic reforms, and </p><p>in fighting corruption, reports say.  Responding to a </p><p>question after the meeting, Pearson said that the Iraqi </p><p>issue was also discussed, and noted that the U.S. preferred </p><p>to work together with the UN for a solution.  Erdogan in </p><p>turn has congratulated President Bush for the Republicans\' </p><p>election victory.  He said the AKP leadership intended to </p><p>visit the U.S. after the new government is formed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economy: Ali Coskun, portrayed by the economic daily "Dunya" </p><p>as the `architect of AKP economic policy,\' said the AKP </p><p>would carry out an economic transformation through a special </p><p>economy ministry, and that privatization would be </p><p>accelerated.  Instead of axing jobs, AKP prefers personnel </p><p>reform in the public sector based on productivity and merit, </p><p>Coskun said.  `In order to ease the burden on the public </p><p>sector, we are considering shifting some authority from the </p><p>central government to local administrations,\' Coskun added. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" criticizes the AKP intention to abolish </p><p>`financial year zero\' regulation, saying it would deal a </p><p>heavy blow to the fight against money laundering.  The paper </p><p>claims that AKP market regulations will strengthen Islamic </p><p>capital.  Meanwhile, S&P has revised its outlook on Turkey\'s </p><p>debt from negative to stable.  S&P analysts said they did </p><p>not expect significant economic changes under the new </p><p>government, but a possible war on Iraq might increase risks </p><p>in Turkey.  The international investment bank Morgan Stanley </p><p>said that single-party government had significant chances to </p><p>accelerate democratization in Turkey.  IMF official Tom </p><p>Dawson said it was natural for the new government to make </p><p>some minor changes to the IMF-sponsored economic program. </p><p>The new leaders have voiced a willingness to work with us, </p><p>and the IMF is ready to cooperate, Dawson said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  US Mid-Term Elections </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"George Bush the Cowboy, the Unstoppable" </p><p>Ali Sirmen commented in social democrat-intellectual </p><p>Cumhuriyet (11/8): "The mid-term election results </p><p>represented not only a victory for the Republican Party, but </p><p>also broke a record in the Party\'s history.  The Bush </p><p>administration has now obtained sufficient power to pass any </p><p>legislation in Congress. . It looks like the Republican </p><p>Party victory stemmed not only from the post-9/11 </p><p>circumstances, but also from the failure of Democrats to </p><p>produce alternate policies.  Nevertheless, the Bush </p><p>administration manipulated the September 11 events very well </p><p>and convinced the American public to follow Bush\'s </p><p>unrealistic approach: `what is good for the US is good for </p><p>the world.\'  . With the help of the off-year election </p><p>results, the Bush administration has received the voters\' </p><p>support for its biased and arbitrary policies.  That means </p><p>that no one can possibly stop President Bush and his cowboy- </p><p>mentality policies on world issues such as Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Republican Victory" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in conservative-mass appeal Turkiye </p><p>(11/8): "The election results were somehow surprising, as it </p><p>has generally been the opposition party that enjoyed greater </p><p>popularity during mid-term elections.  It seems that the </p><p>September 11 syndrome continues to be a major motivating </p><p>factor for Americans.  The voters are giving the message </p><p>that the most vicious terrorist attack is not yet avenged. </p><p>This message clearly gives an extra bonus to President Bush, </p><p>particularly for his militaristic policies in Iraq and </p><p>elsewhere.  The current UN initiative will most likely </p><p>produce a resolution leading to the elimination of Iraq\'s </p><p>WMD as well as complete control of Iraq.  However, even that </p><p>is not going to be sufficient for the Bush administration, </p><p>which is determined to topple Saddam Hussein at all costs." </p><p></p></div>
