(C) ZIMBABWE\'S COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) </p><p>ANNOUNCED FEBRUARY 15 THAT IT WILL HOLD A SPECIAL </p><p>CONGRESS ON MARCH 21 TO EXAMINE WAYS TO RE-ENGAGE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ON THE LAND ISSUE.  AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT APPROACH TO THE GOZ ON THE LAND ISSUE BY A </p><p>FORMER CFU PRESIDENT WAS SLAPPED BACK WITH HARDLY </p><p>MEASURED DISDAIN.  THE GOZ RESPONSE IN THE PRESS IS THAT </p><p>IT WOULD ONLY TALK TO INDIVIDUAL COMMERCIAL FARMERS, NOT </p><p>THE CFU, WHOSE ONLY GOAL IS TO FRUSTRATE THE "FAST- </p><p>TRACK" LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  THE </p><p>MINISTER OF LANDS, AGRICULTURE AND RURAL RESETTLEMENT, </p><p>JOSEPH MADE, RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOZ HAD </p><p>GAZETTED ANOTHER 33 COMMERCIAL FARMS FOR COMPULSORY </p><p>ACQUISITION, AND THAT THE 5 MILLION HECTARES OF LAND </p><p>PREVIOUSLY TARGETED UNDER "FAST-TRACK" IS ONLY A </p><p>"MINIMUM" QUANTITY NEEDED FOR THE PROGRAM, ALTHOUGH NO </p><p>NEW TARGET HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED.  MEANWHILE, TENSIONS </p><p>CONTINUE TO SIMMER ON ZIMBABWE\'S OCCUPIED COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMS, WITH TWO INCIDENTS IN THE LAST WEEK INVOLVING THE </p><p>SHOOTING OF OCCUPIERS BY FARM GUARDS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00815  01 OF 03  231109Z </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>CFU TO CONVENE SPECIAL CONGRESS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>UNION (CFU), TIM HENWOOD, ANNOUNCED ON FEBRUARY 15 THAT </p><p>THE CFU WOULD HOLD A SPECIAL CONGRESS ON MARCH 21 TO TRY </p><p>AND FIND A WAY TO RE-ENGAGE THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>(GOZ) ON LAND REFORM.  THE CONGRESS WILL ALSO DECIDE ON </p><p>POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE CFU\'S NATIONAL LEADERSHIP.  THIS </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT FOLLOWED A CONTENTIOUS MEETING OF THE CFU\'S </p><p>25-MEMBER COUNCIL ON FEBRUARY 13, AT WHICH DIVISIONS </p><p>EMERGED REGARDING A CONSENSUS APPROACH TO THE GOZ\'S </p><p>"FAST-TRACK" RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  THE GOZ-CONTROLLED </p><p>"THE HERALD" NEWSPAPER REPORTED ON FEBRUARY 17 THAT SOME </p><p>COUNCIL MEMBERS, INCLUDING PAST PRESIDENTS OF THE CFU, </p><p>BLAMED THE CURRENT CFU NATIONAL LEADERSHIP FOR THE </p><p>BREAKDOWN IN DIALOGUE WITH THE GOZ.  THESE COUNCIL </p><p>MEMBERS REPORTEDLY WANT THE CFU TO ENDORSE THE "FAST- </p><p>TRACK" PROGRAM AND WORK WITH THE GOZ TO SEE THAT THE </p><p>PROGRAM SUCCEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON FEBRUARY 21, ECONOFF SPOKE WITH RICHARD AMYOT, </p><p>CFU DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR COMMODITIES, REGARDING THE </p><p>UPCOMING SPECIAL CONGRESS.  AMYOT SAID THAT THE GOZ- </p><p>CONTROLLED PRESS ACCOUNT OF A STORMY CFU COUNCIL MEETING </p><p>WAS AN EXAGGERATION.  ACCORDING TO AMYOT, THERE WAS NO </p><p>"BLOOD ON THE WALLS" AFTERWARDS.  AMYOT SAID THE COUNCIL </p><p>MEETING WAS TRIGGERED BY BEHIND-THE-SCENES PRESSURE FROM </p><p>GOZ MINISTERS INVOLVED IN "FAST-TRACK" (MINISTER OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00815  01 OF 03  231109Z </p><p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC WORKS AND NATIONAL HOUSING, </p><p>IGNATIUS CHOMBO, MINISTER OF LANDS, AGRICULTURE AND </p><p>RURAL RESETTLEMENT, JOSEPH MADE, AND MINISTER OF RURAL </p><p>RESOURCES AND WATER DEVELOPMENT, JOYCE MUJURU), AND </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE HIMSELF, TO REMOVE CFU PRESIDENT TIM </p><p>HENWOOD, AND DIRECTOR DAVID HASLUCK.  AMYOT WAS ADAMANT </p><p>THAT THE CFU WOULD NOT BE COWED BY THE GOZ, AND MADE </p><p>CLEAR THAT THE CFU ELECTS ITS OWN LEADERSHIP IN A </p><p>DEMOCRATIC FASHION.  THE SPECIAL CONGRESS, ACCORDING TO </p><p>AMYOT, WILL CONSIDER WAYS TO RE-ENGAGE THE GOZ ON THE </p><p>LAND ISSUE, AND WILL DECIDE WHETHER TO CHANGE ITS </p><p>CURRENT NATIONAL LEADERSHIP.  HE ADDED THAT HE IS NOT </p><p>SURE OF THE BENEFITS OF A SPECIAL CONGRESS, SINCE THE </p><p>GOZ AND ZANU-PF ARE TREATING LAND AS A POLITICAL ISSUE </p><p>AND DO NOT APPEAR INTERESTED IN ACHIEVING A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION THROUGH A REASONED DIALOGUE AMONG </p><p>ALL STAKEHOLDERS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>THE GOZ REJECTS DIALOGUE WITH THE CFU </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.

THE CFU HAS BEEN USING </p><p>FOREIGN FUNDING TO FIGHT GOVERNMENT\'S PROGRAM, INCLUDING </p><p>LAND REFORM.  HOW THEN ARE WE EXPECTED TO ENTER INTO </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE UNION?"  HE ADDED THAT "IT WAS CLEAR </p><p>THAT THE CFU WAS NO LONGER SPEAKING FOR FARMERS BUT HAD </p><p>TURNED INTO A POLITICAL GROUP AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>CONSIDERING DE-REGISTERING THE UNION FOR ITS NEFARIOUS </p><p>ACTIVITIES."  (COMMENT: THIS APPEARS TO BE A CLASSIC </p><p>EXAMPLE OF ZANU-PF USING THEIR "DIVIDE AND CONQUER" </p><p>STRATEGY BY ENCOURAGING DISSENT AMONG THE COMMECIAL </p><p>FARMERS.)  MINISTER CHOMBO ALSO DISMISSED A PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR INITIATIVE UNDERTAKEN BY VARIOUS ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>BUSINESS PEOPLE AND COMMERCIAL FARMERS AS AN ALTERNATIVE </p><p>TO THE COMPULSORY ACQUISITION MODEL OF "FAST-TRACK" </p><p>(REFTEL).  REGARDING THE PEOPLE BEHIND THIS INITIATIVE, </p><p>CHOMBO SAID, "THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR </p><p>BUSINESS.  WHERE HAVE THEY BEEN ALL THESE YEARS?" </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) POST OBTAINED FROM CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES THREE </p><p>DOCUMENTS RELATED TO COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' EFFORTS TO </p><p>ENGAGE THE GOZ ANEW ON LAND REFORM.  THE FIRST IS A </p><p>LETTER, DATED FEBRUARY 9, LABELED "SECRET" BY THE </p><p>WRITER, FROM NICK SWANEPOEL, A FORMER CFU PRESIDENT, TO </p><p>MINISTER CHOMBO, OFFERING TO MAKE CHANGES AT THE CFU IN </p><p>ORDER TO BREAK THE IMPASSE ON LAND.

ACCEPTING THE GOZ REQUIREMENT OF 5 MILLION </p><p>      HECTARES OF COMMERCIAL FARMLAND FOR RESETTLEMENT </p><p> </p><p>=  4. DROPPING ALL LAWSUITS AGAINST THE GOZ OVER </p><p>      "FAST-TRACK" </p><p> </p><p>=  5. ASSURING COOPERATION OF COMMERCIAL FARMERS IN </p><p>      ASSISTING RESETTLED PEOPLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AS </p><p>      FARMERS, AND </p><p> </p><p>=  6. LOBBYING DONORS TO RELEASE FUNDS TO SUPPORT </p><p>      "FAST-TRACK" </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE SECOND DOCUMENT IS A LETTER FROM MINISTER </p><p>CHOMBO, DATED FEBRUARY 13, TO VICE PRESIDENT MSIKA </p><p>REGARDING THE SWANEPOEL LETTER, IN WHICH CHOMBO STATES </p><p>THAT HE VIEWS THE SWANEPOEL OFFER AS LIKELY BEING JUST </p><p>ANOTHER DIVERSIONARY TACTIC OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS. </p><p>THE THIRD DOCUMENT IS A LETTER FROM MSIKA TO CHOMBO, </p><p>DATED FEBRUARY 19, IN WHICH MSIKA AGREES THAT THE </p><p>SWANEPOEL OFFER COULD BE A DIVERSIONARY TACTIC, BUT THAT </p><p>CHOMBO SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE LETTER AND INDICATE THAT </p><p>BEFORE THE GOZ WILL SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE OFFER THEY </p><p>EXPECT CONCRETE ACTION ON THE FIRST, FOURTH, AND SIXTH </p><p>ITEMS OF THE PROPOSAL.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE "SECRET" </p><p>LETTER FROM SWANEPOEL TO CHOMBO IS WHAT LED TO THE CFU </p><p>FULL COUNCIL MEETING ON FEBRUARY 13, AND THE SUBSEQUENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00815  02 OF 03  231109Z </p><p>DECISION BY HENWOOD TO CALL A CFU SPECIAL CONGRESS FOR </p><p>MARCH 21. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) HENWOOD REITERATED IN HIS FEBRUARY 15 PRESS </p><p>RELEASE ANNOUNCING THE UPCOMING SPECIAL CONGRESS THAT, </p><p>"THE CFU IS A POLITICALLY NON-PARTISAN ORGANIZATION WITH </p><p>A MANDATE TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF ITS MEMBERS AND </p><p>TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY."  AMYOT CLAIMED </p><p>TO US THAT THE CFU RECEIVES NO FOREIGN FUNDING OF ANY </p><p>KIND.  HE SAID THE CFU\'S FUNDING IS DERIVED FROM FARMERS </p><p>MEMBERSHIP FEES AND COMMODITY ASSOCIATION LEVIES ON </p><p>FARMERS SALES OF PRODUCE.  AMYOT ADDED THAT WHILE THE </p><p>SPECIAL CONGRESS WOULD EXAMINE HOW TO RE-ENGAGE </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH THE GOZ, THE CFU WAS ALSO URGING </p><p>INDIVIDUAL FARMERS TO MAKE THE SAME EFFORTS IN THEIR </p><p>DISTRICTS AND PROVINCES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>THE GOZ GAZETTES MORE FARMS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.

(COMMENT: MADE\'S STATEMENT THAT 5 </p><p>MILLION HECTARES IS NOW ONLY THE MINIMUM AMOUNT THAT THE </p><p>GOZ REQUIRES FOR RESETTLEMENT TRACKS WITH OTHER SOURCES </p><p>CLAIMS THAT THE 5 MILLION HECTARE TARGET HAS BEEN </p><p>INCREASED.  WE BELIEVE THIS PROVIDES FURTHER </p><p>CONFIRMATION THAT THE GOZ INTENDS TO USE PHASE II OF </p><p>"FAST-TRACK" FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES.  THE SCENARIO IS </p><p>THAT THE GOZ WILL PROMISE LAND FOR COMMERCIAL FARMING TO </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE MASSES IN RETURN FOR THEIR VOTES FOR MUGABE </p><p>IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  AFTER THE </p><p>ELECTION, WE EXPECT THE GOZ TO CONVENIENTLY DETERMINE </p><p>THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO APPLIED UNDER PHASE II WILL NOT </p><p>QUALIFY FOR LAND.

HE REPLIED THAT TENSIONS WERE </p><p>HIGH ON OCCUPIED FARMS, AND THAT FARM OCCUPIERS IN </p><p>MASVINGO PROVINCE, ESPECIALLY THE "WAR VETS", HAVE BEEN </p><p>PARTICULARLY AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE OF THE ENCOURAGEMENT </p><p>THEY HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR JOSIAH </p><p>HUNGWE.

HOWEVER, WE ARE </p><p>SKEPTICAL THAT A CHANGE IN THE CFU NATIONAL LEADERSHIP, </p><p>OR AN OFFER BY THE CFU TO WORK WITH THE GOZ TO MAKE </p><p>"FAST-TRACK" SUCCESSFUL, WILL END THE CURRENT IMPASSE. </p><p>IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GOZ AND ZANU-PF ARE MANIPULATING </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE FOR POLITICAL ENDS, AND ARE NOT SERIOUSLY </p><p>INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING THE INEQUITABLE OWNERSHIP OF </p><p>LAND IN ZIMBABWE.
