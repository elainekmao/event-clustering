<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 001250 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: REGIME FEEDS ON ITS OWN </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 602 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  On September 26, the regime sentenced </p><p>ex-dictator General Ne Win\'s son-in-law and three grandsons </p><p>to death by hanging for attempted treason.  The son-in-law, </p><p>one of the grandsons, and some business associates were also </p><p>sentenced to varying lengths of hard labor for economic </p><p>crimes.  The verdicts culminate highly publicized trials that </p><p>began in early May.  A lack of hard evidence did not appear </p><p>to hinder the court, and most believe the attack on the Ne </p><p>Win family was orchestrated to quash any doubts about Senior </p><p>General Than Shwe\'s ultimate authority in Burma.  Most </p><p>observers believe the Senior General will now step in to </p><p>commute the death sentences, balancing his display of </p><p>strength with one of compassion.  However, there is the </p><p>possibility that the four will indeed be hanged.  The general </p><p>public views the whole affair as a power play between the </p><p>elite, with little or no bearing on their daily lives.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Guilty On All Counts... </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) </p><p>handed down death sentences for high treason to the </p><p>son-in-law and three grandsons of ex-strongman General Ne Win </p><p>in a hearing on September 26.  Culminating trials that began </p><p>in early May (reftel), the hearing, which was open to family </p><p>members, journalists, and diplomats, lasted from early </p><p>morning into the evening as the judges summarized evidence </p><p>that the four men had conspired to overthrow the government </p><p>and illegally imported cars and cellular telephones.  The </p><p>first phase of the hearing summarized evidence of economic </p><p>crimes by grandson Kyaw Ne Win, a locally renowned gang </p><p>leader and thug, son-in-law Aye Zaw Win, and a handful of </p><p>their local business partners.  For these crimes, Kyaw Ne Win </p><p>received 49 years of hard labor, while the others received </p><p>lesser sentences of hard labor. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  The second phase of the trial listed evidence of </p><p>high treason against the grandsons and son-in-law, focusing </p><p>primarily on the testimony of a military officer, a letter </p><p>from the son-in-law to the court appealing for mercy (which </p><p>was interpreted as an admission of guilt), and items seized </p><p>from the houses and businesses of the four such as radios, </p><p>flashlights, and guard uniforms.  Although the evidence </p><p>appeared weak, the judge sentenced the four to death by </p><p>hanging for attempting to seize State power and life </p><p>imprisonment for enticing the military to betray the State. </p><p>(Note:  We have been told that, bizarrely, in verdicts </p><p>entailing death and life imprisonment, the hangman\'s rope is </p><p>removed from the corpse and kept in prison to serve the life </p><p>sentence after the execution.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Although family members in attendance cried as the </p><p>verdicts were announced the four defendants appeared resigned </p><p>to their fate.  When told they had seven days to file an </p><p>appeal, the father brusquely stated, "if the State wants to </p><p>kill us, we will not fight it," and the boys nodded their </p><p>agreement.  It is up to the Supreme Court to set the date and </p><p>time of the executions.  The wife and mother of the </p><p>defendants, Ne Win\'s formerly powerful daughter Sanda Win, is </p><p>reportedly still under house arrest with the ex-strongman at </p><p>the family\'s lakeside compound.  We have no information yet </p><p>on how she or Ne Win reacted to the verdicts. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Comment:  The verdicts have generated only mild </p><p>public interest in Burma.  While there is no love lost for </p><p>the Ne Win clan, most average Burmese see the trial and </p><p>verdicts as the end of a struggle among the elite, which will </p><p>have little or no effect on their lives.  With economic </p><p>conditions continuing to spiral downward and prices </p><p>skyrocketing, most citizens are focusing on their next meal </p><p>rather than the travails of the power elite.  Among our </p><p>contacts, most do not believe the regime will carry out the </p><p>death sentences.  The arrest and trial of the family members </p><p>have already demonstrated the regime\'s power and its </p><p>intolerance of dissent, even among those previously </p><p>considered "untouchables."  In this view, the Senior General </p><p>could now demonstrate his compassion by commuting the death </p><p>sentences and leaving the four to serve life sentences.  A </p><p>minority view is that with the publicity attached to the </p><p>public trial and verdicts, the Senior General must let the </p><p>sentences stand to demonstrate that the military is resolute </p><p>in its undertakings. End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
