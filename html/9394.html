<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000635 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>State pass to USTR for Bryan </p><p>USDOC for 3132/OIO/EAP/Kelleher </p><p>USDOC also for 1431/MAC/AP/HPPho </p><p>USDOC also for ITA/IA/5120/4230/2130 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EFIS, EAGR, ECON, VM, BTA </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM\'S CATFISH FARMERS PETITION CONSULATE GENERAL, </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE AND ITC FOR RELIEF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Introduction and Summary </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>1.  On July 9, three fish farmers representing the Fisheries </p><p>Association of An Giang, the province in the Mekong Delta where </p><p>most of Vietnam\'s tra and basa fish are raised and processed, met </p><p>with CG and Econoff at the Consulate General.  Indicating they </p><p>represent about 40,000 farmers and family members involved in fish </p><p>farming, they delivered a petition signed by more than 200 fish </p><p>farmers protesting the anti-dumping margins set by the U.S. </p><p>Department of Commerce on frozen basa and tra fillets and asked </p><p>that the margins be reconsidered or delayed.  The petition itself </p><p>was addressed to the Chairman of the ITC, the Secretary of </p><p>Commerce, and the U.S. Consul General.  Hard copies of the </p><p>petition and signatures will be forwarded to the ITC and the </p><p>Department of Commerce. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The petitioners were represented by three fish farmers, all of </p><p>relatively modest means.  Although large fish raising operations </p><p>do exist in the Delta, most fish farmers work on houseboats that </p><p>sit atop large fish cages floating in the Mekong River.  Farmers </p><p>typically live in these boats with their families.  Two of the </p><p>farmers who presented the petition owned one cage each, and one </p><p>farmer, who spoke a bit of English, owned four cages.  All of the </p><p>men were extremely polite, and made their points energetically, </p><p>but with courtesy. </p><p> </p><p>June 17 Final Determination Brings Hard Times </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>3.  The fish farmers stated they were representing about 40,000 </p><p>farmers and family members who have been affected by the anti- </p><p>dumping margins.  They stated that although they believed </p><p>Vietnamese fish processors would still continue to make money, the </p><p>brunt of the anti-dumping measures had fallen squarely on the </p><p>shoulders of the fish farmers.  They pointed out that since the </p><p>June 17 final determination had been issued, fish prices had </p><p>fallen from about 10,000 -12,000 VND (65 -77 US cents) per kilo to </p><p>about 8,500 VND (55 cents) per kilo currently.  They had been </p><p>higher earlier in the year.  To break even, the farmers estimated </p><p>they had to clear about 10,000 VND per kilo.  The men were very </p><p>concerned that they would be unable to sell their current fish </p><p>stocks without incurring substantial losses.  Even as prices </p><p>remained low, they noted, they still had to feed the fish.  They </p><p>were also worried the fish were growing larger than the size </p><p>preferred by the processors, which would further depress the </p><p>price. </p><p> </p><p>4.  When asked if they would be able to convert to raising other </p><p>varieties of fish, they said that they would try to start raising </p><p>roughy or tilapia, but they still had to unload their current </p><p>stocks of tra and basa fish, which would push them into (further) </p><p>debt.. </p><p> </p><p>We Can\'t Afford to Be "Dumping" </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>5.  The fish farmers also argued that they had not been "dumping" </p><p>their product on the U.S. market.  Although prices had fluctuated </p><p>even before the anti-dumping case, the farmers could not afford to </p><p>go without profits.  They pointed out that many fish farmers had </p><p>to borrow against the value of their boats to secure funding and </p><p>that they did not have enough capital to sustain losses.  Thus </p><p>their current problem of disposing of their current stocks of tra </p><p>and basa was extremely troubling.  They also pointed out that they </p><p>buy their fish food and sell their fish at market prices - not at </p><p>prices set or guided by any government authority.  Prices were low </p><p>relative to the U.S., they noted, because of An Giang\'s natural </p><p>environment, which is conducive to raising fish, low labor costs, </p><p>and the fact that much of the labor was from family hands. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The three fish farmers asked the CG to pass along their views </p><p>and for the USG to lower the margin rates or at least delay their </p><p>imposition until current stocks could be sold. </p><p> </p><p>"You Mean We Came All This Way for Nothing?" </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>7.  CG Yamauchi thanked the farmers for their visit and assured </p><p>them that she would pass along their views.  CG and Econoff then </p><p>briefly outlined the process of an anti-dumping investigation and </p><p>determinations.  The CG noted the process was quasi-judicial and </p><p>allowed for public comment.  Anti-dumping cases are allowed under </p><p>the Bilateral Trade Agreement and the U.S. mechanism is in line </p><p>with WTO guidelines.  During the anti-dumping case, both the GVN </p><p>and the Vietnamese industry had availed themselves of the </p><p>opportunity to supply additional information and comment.   If </p><p>Vietnam were a WTO member, she noted, Vietnam would have the right </p><p>to take the decision to the WTO. She also noted that by law the </p><p>U.S. Consulate had no role in the investigation or in the </p><p>determination.  Econoff also clarified that at this point in the </p><p>process, the margins had been already set and that the ITC </p><p>decision, coming at the end of this month, is based on a </p><p>determination of whether the U.S. catfish industry is actually </p><p>suffering or facing the threat of material injury.  The ITC could </p><p>not revise the margin rate, nor do they have the authority to </p><p>delay imposition of the margins.  The farmers seemed surprised to </p><p>learn this, and one of the farmers stated: "So you mean that after </p><p>coming here we have to go back to An Giang with nothing?" </p><p> </p><p>8.  Comment:  It is difficult not to feel sympathetic toward these </p><p>fish farmers, who went to considerable effort to travel the 6 </p><p>hours by car from An Giang Province to Ho Chi Minh City to state </p><p>their case.  Each has been farming for at least 10 years, one for </p><p>more than 20 years.  Their dark tans and calloused hands testify </p><p>to their hard work.  They have earned a reasonable living, and by </p><p>rural Vietnamese standards are relatively well-off.  Just the </p><p>same, however, most of their assets are tied up in the boats they </p><p>live on and the fish inside the floating cages underneath.  In at </p><p>least the short term they will face substantial losses.   In time, </p><p>according to these farmers, it is likely many farmers will be able </p><p>to switch to other varieties of fish.  If enough do so, and demand </p><p>for tra and basa continue to expand in non-US markets, prices will </p><p>once again rise.  The farmers\' biggest worry now is whether or not </p><p>they can sell their stocks without losing so much money that they </p><p>go out of business before they even get a second chance at raising </p><p>different fish. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
