(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS JAMES BRUNO; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: THE PRESIDENT\'S TRIP TO VIETNAM ELECTRIFIED </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE PUBLIC -- AND SURPRISED THE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS OF SEVERAL HUNDRED </p><p>THOUSAND LINED THE STREETS TO GREET THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST </p><p>LADY ON THEIR HISTORIC VISIT TO HANOI AND HO CHI MINH CITY. </p><p>THREE WEEKS AFTER THE VISIT, THE MESSAGE THE PRESIDENT </p><p>DELIVERED IN HIS NATIONALLY TELEVISED ADDRESS AND IN BOTH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02667  01 OF 06  081334Z </p><p>PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EVENTS CONTINUES TO REVERBERATE IN </p><p>VIETNAMESE COFFEE SHOPS, AS WELL AS IN THE BACKROOMS OF THE </p><p>PARTY LEADERSHIP.  IN ONE DRAMATIC EXAMPLE IN A PROVINCIAL </p><p>CAPITAL, A PRIEST CONVENED GROUPS OF SEVERAL HUNDRED </p><p>PARISHIONERS TO DISCUSS THE IDEAS OF FREEDOM AND GLOBAL </p><p>ENGAGEMENT CONTAINED IN THE PRESIDENT\'S ADDRESS.  IN HANOI, </p><p>THE POLITBURO REPORTEDLY WILL MEET DECEMBER 8 TO DISCUSS </p><p>THE TRIP. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY (CONT\'D): FOR THE COMMUNIST PARTY (CPV) </p><p>AUTHORITIES, THE EFFUSIVE POPULAR REACTION TO THE PRESIDENT </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY GIVES THEM PAUSE.  POST-WAR VIETNAM HAS SEEN </p><p>NOTHING LIKE THE RECEPTION THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED, AND THIS </p><p>IS A VIVID REMINDER THAT POPULAR FEELING FOR THE RULING </p><p>AUTHORITIES IS, BY COMPARISON, LUKEWARM AT BEST.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT\'S VISIT, HIS CALL FOR FREE TRADE AND </p><p>FREE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS, AND THE OUTPOURING OF POPULAR </p><p>SUPPORT FOR HIM WILL BE A KEY TOPIC OF DEBATE AS THE CPV </p><p>LEADERSHIP MOVES INTO ITS PARTY CONGRESS IN MARCH.  THIS </p><p>CUTS TWO WAYS IN THE ONGOING CPV DISCUSSIONS ABOUT </p><p>GLOBALIZATION.  CAUTIOUS IDEOLOGUES SUCH AS GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY PHIEU EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO PROCEED CAREFULLY TO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>GUARD AGAINST WESTERN ATTEMPTS AT "PEACEFUL EVOLUTION," </p><p>WHILE MORE REFORM-MINDED LEADERS MAY FEEL STRENGTHENED BY </p><p>THE POPULAR SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF GREATER ENGAGEMENT WITH </p><p>THE U.S. AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>WIDESPREAD POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT\'S VISIT... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN THE THREE WEEKS SINCE THE PRESIDENT\'S TRIP TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02667  01 OF 06  081334Z </p><p>VIETNAM NOVEMBER 16-19, EMBASSY OFFICERS HAVE MET WITH </p><p>DISPARATE GROUPS OF VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS AND PRIVATE </p><p>CITIZENS IN PROVINCES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  THE UNANIMOUS </p><p>CONSENSUS IS THAT VIETNAM HAS NEVER SEEN A VISIT LIKE THIS </p><p>ONE -- OR ONE THAT HAS HAD SUCH RIPPLING EFFECTS ON THE </p><p>CITIZENRY.  FIRST AND MOST VISIBLY, WERE THE CROWDS.  IN </p><p>HANOI, THE USUALLY RESTRAINED NORTHERNERS TURNED OUT IN </p><p>UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS ALONG THE PATH OF THE MOTORCADE </p><p>COMING IN FROM THE AIRPORT, GATHERED OUTSIDE THE DAEWOO </p><p>HOTEL WHERE THE PRESIDENT STAYED, AND CLUSTERED ON THE </p><p>PERIMETER OF HIS EVENTS AROUND TOWN.  THE OFFICIAL MEDIA </p><p>DID NOT PUBLICIZE THE PRESIDENT\'S SCHEDULE, BUT PEOPLE </p><p>FOUND OUT ANYWAY -- SOME TOLD US THEY LISTENED TO BBC, </p><p>OTHERS LEARNED FROM VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS WHO PASSED THE </p><p>WORD TO FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.  ONE WESTERN BUSINESSMAN </p><p>SAID HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HIS WHOLE STAFF CONVERGE ON </p><p>HIS WINDOW OFFICE DURING THE WORK DAY ONLY FIVE MINUTES </p><p>BEFORE THE </p><p></p></div>
