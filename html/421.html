<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 JEDDAH 02807 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM GNEHM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAITI SAUDI RELATIONS - A KUWAITI PERSPECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY </p><p>-   ------- </p><p> </p><p>GIVEN THE VAST DIMENSIONS OF THE GULF CRISIS AND THE </p><p>INTENSE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT AT </p><p>THE PRESENT TIME, FRICTION OR DISAGREEMENTS ARE AMAZINGLY </p><p>FEW AND GENERALLY OF A MARGINAL NATURE - AT LEAST FROM </p><p>THE KUWAITI PERSPECTIVE.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, AS MIGHT BE </p><p>EXPECTED GIVEN THE PASSAGE OF TIME, A NUMBER OF RUBS IN </p><p>THE RELATIONSHIP.  WHILE KUWAITI OFFICIALS REMAIN </p><p>GENERALLY CONFIDENT ABOUT SAUDI POLICY, THERE ARE </p><p>CONCERNS LACED WITH FEAR OVER THE SAUDIS BOTH WITHIN AND </p><p>OUTSIDE THE AL SAUD FAMILY WHO ESPOUSE COMPROMISE WITH </p><p>IRAQ AT KUWAITI EXPENSE.  KUWAITIS ALSO QUESTION THE </p><p>SAUDI DECISION TO LOCATE THE GOK IN ISOLATED TAIF AND </p><p>THEY ARE UPSET OVER SAUDI CONSTRAINTS ON THEIR REBUILDING </p><p>OF THE KUWAITI MILITARY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  KUWAIT LITERALLY DRIVEN INTO SAUDI ARABIA </p><p>-   ----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE AUGUST 2 IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT AND SUBSEQUENT </p><p>IRAQI BRUTALITIES IN KUWAIT LITERALLY DROVE KUWAIT INTO </p><p>SAUDI ARABIA.  THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES AND THE BULK OF </p><p>KUWAIT\'S GOVER`MENT ARRIVED ON THE SCENE IN NEED OF </p><p>SUPPORT AND SUSTENANCE.  THE SAUDIS WERE AND REMAIN </p><p>GENEROUS WITH BOTH.  THE SAUD FAMILY OPENLY RECALLED THE </p><p>SABAH FAMILY (AND KUWAITI) SUPPORT FOR THE SAUDS DURING </p><p>THEIR EXILE FROM SAUDI ARABIA EARLIER IN THE CENTURY AND </p><p>THEY MADE CLEAR THEY WERE STANDING BY THEIR FRIENDS IN </p><p>NEED DURING THIS CRISIS.  SAUDI SUPPORT HAS BEEN </p><p>EXTENSIVE WITH MATERIAL AID (FOOD AND HOUSING) TO </p><p>THOUSANDS OF DISPLACED KUWAITI NATIONALS.  THE SAG HAS </p><p>ALSO HELPED THE GOK TO RECONSTITUTE ITSELF IN THE KINGDOM </p><p>AND HAS FACILITATED THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF KUWAITI </p><p>OFFICIALS AND THEIR GUESTS.  GENERALLY THE SAUDIS HAVE </p><p>GIVEN THE GOK FREE REIGN MOST DRAMATICALLY SEEN IN THE </p><p>CONVOCATION OF AN ALL-KUWAITI CONFERENCE THAT HIGH- </p><p>LIGHTED KUWAITI COMMITMENTS TO PARTICIPATORY GOVERNMENT. </p><p>ON THE MILITARY FRONT, THE SAUDIS PERMITTED THE KUWAITIS </p><p>TO REFURBISH THEIR AIR FORCE ON SAUDI BASES AND THERE IS </p><p>A SIMILAR PROGRAM WITH KUWAITI LAND FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  KUWAITIS CONTINUE TO EXPRESS APPRECIATION FOR SAUDI </p><p>HOSPITALITY AND GENEROSITY AND THAT GRATITUDE REMAINS </p><p>BASIC IN THE RELATIONSHIP.  AT THE SAME TIME THE KUWAITIS </p><p>DO EXPRESS SOME FRUSTRATION - LARGELY STEMMING FROM AN </p><p>UNNATURAL DEPENDENCY.  MANY KUWAITI OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>INCREASINGLY UNHAPPY WITH THE LOCATION OF THE GOK IN </p><p>TAIF.  WHILE INITIALLY ACCEPTING THE SAUDI ARGUMENT IN </p><p>FAVOR OF SECURITY, WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME AND A CHANGED </p><p>POLITICAL AND MILITARY SITUATION IN THE AREA, THE </p><p>KUWAITIS NOW FEEL INCREASINGLY ISOLATED AND CUT OFF FROM </p><p>EVENTS.  KUWAITI OFFICIALS NOTE THAT VISITORS (INCLUDING </p><p>A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF U.S. CONGRESSIONAL GROUPS) PASS </p><p>THROUGH NEARBY JEDDAH BUT DO NOT MAKE IT TO TAIF.  THEY </p><p>LISTEN TO NEWSCASTERS WHO REPEATEDLY DISPARAGE THE GOK AS </p><p>RESIDENT IN  A POSH HOTEL IN THE SAUDI MOUNTAIN RESORT. </p><p>KUWAITIS IN EXILE CERTAINLY DO NOT CONSIDER TAIF A RESORT </p><p>AND DESPAIR AT THE MEDIA\'S CONTINUED HARPING ON THIS </p><p>THEME.  THE KUWAITIS TEND TO BLAME THE SAUDIS FOR THEIR </p><p>PREDICAMENT.  WE HEAR MORE AND MORE TALK FROM THE </p><p>KUWAITIS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO RELOCATE BUT THEY </p><p>BELIEVE THE SAUDIS WILL NOT AGREE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  KING SOLID, UNCERTAINTY ABOUT OTHERS </p><p>-   ------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>THE KUWAITIS REMAIN GENERALLY CONVINCED THAT SAUDI POLICY </p><p>IS FIRMLY BEHIND FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSC RESOLUTIONS </p><p>- SPECIFICALLY FULL AND COMPLETE IRAQI WITHDRAWAL AND </p><p>RETURN OF THE LEGITIMATE KUWAITI GOVERNMENT.  THIS </p><p>CONVICTION RESTS LARGELY ON THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BETWEEN THE AMIR AND KING FAHD.  KUWAITIS REPEATEDLY </p><p>REFER TO THE KING\'S STAUNCH SUPPORT.  IN DOING SO, </p><p>HOWEVER, IT OFTEN IMPLIES AN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE </p><p>STRENGTH OF SUPPORT ELSEWHERE WITHIN THE SAUDI </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  AT VARIOUS TIMES ONE HAS HEARD CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT THE POSITION OF CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH OR DEFENSE </p><p>MINISTER PRINCE SULTAN, BUT THESE DOUBTS APPEAR MORE A </p><p>CONSEQUENCE OF THE EVER ONGOING KUWAITI PROPENSITY  TO </p><p>DISSECT AND TO ANALYZE EACH AND EVERY INDICATOR OF </p><p>POSSIBLE SHIFTS IN ATTITUDES TOWARD THEIR CAUSE.  THERE </p><p>ARE ALWAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, NERVOUS DISCUSSIONS OF EACH NEWS </p><p>REPORT THAT SOME ARAB OR OTHER POLITICAL FIGURE IS </p><p>UNDERTAKING AN EFFORT TO MEDIATE THE CRISIS.  INEVITABLY, </p><p>THEY FRET OVER ANY INDICATION THE SAUDIS MAY BE INVOLVED. </p><p>THUS FAR, SENIOR KUWAITI OFFICIALS REMAIN CONVINCED THAT </p><p>SAUDI POLICY IS FIRM, BUT ONE NOW HEARS MORE RUMBLINGS </p><p>THAN BEFORE FROM LESSER OFFICIALS CONCERNED THAT SAUDI </p><p>DETERMINATION MAY ERODE.  THEY CITE MOUNTING DEBATE </p><p>WITHIN THE KINGDOM BY SOME LESSER MEMBERS OF THE SAUD </p><p>FAMILY AS WELL AS NON-ROYALS OVER THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE </p><p>KINGDOM SHOULD RISK WAR AND DISTRUCTION FOR KUWAIT, AND </p><p>WHETHER KUWAIT SHOULD COMPROMISE AND OFFER SADDAM </p><p>FACE-SAVING CONCESSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  KUWAITI-SAUDI COOPERATION FINANCIALLY IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>COALITION PARTNERS HAS BEEN CLOSE AND GENERALLY </p><p>HARMONIOUS.  WORKING SOMEWHAT WITHIN A GCC CONTEXT THE </p><p>TWO HAVE BASICALLY AGREEED ON RECIPIENTS AND LEVELS.  THE </p><p>KUWAITIS ARE PROBABLY MORE WILLING THAN SAUDI ARABIA TO </p><p>PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE TO YEMEN BUT THEY BOW TO STRONG </p><p>SAUDI FEELINGS.  THE KUWAITIS SEEM AS FIRM AS THE SAUDIS </p><p>IN OPPOSING AID TO JORDAN.  THE ONLY FRICTIONS WE DETECT </p><p>IN THIS AREA WAS IN THE ALLOCATION OF DOLS 100 MILLION IN </p><p>KUWAITI ASSISTANCE TO SOME SMALLER STATES (DJIBOUTI, </p><p>SOMALIA, AND LEBANON).  THE KUWAITIS APPARENTLY GAVE </p><p>THEIR DOLS 100 MILLION TO THE SAUDIS TO DISBURSE.  THE </p><p>SAUDIS WITHOUT ASKING RECONFIGURED THE APPORTIONMENT </p><p>AFTER THE KUWAITIS HAD TOLD THOSE GOVERNMENTS OF THEIR </p><p>AID LEVELS LEADING TO SOME EMBARRASSMENT TO KUWAIT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  SOME SNAGS IN MILITARY COOPERATION </p><p>-   ---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>MILITARY COOPERATION APPEARS TO BE LARGELY SUCCESSFUL </p><p>THOUGH WE ARE NOW HEARING REPORTS OF SOME DIFFICULTIES IN </p><p>THIS AREA.  WHEN IRAQ INVADED KUWAIT, KUWAITI PILOTS FLEW </p><p>THEIR FIGHTERS TO SAUDI ARABIA.  KUWAITI SOURCES SAY THE </p><p>SAUDIS REFUSED TO REFUEL THE PLANES SO THEY COULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO FIGHT.  ULTIMATELY THE  SAUDIS BASED THE </p><p>KUWAITI A-4S IN KHAMIS MUSHAYT AND THE MIRAGE FIGHTERS IN </p><p>TAIF.  IN THE DAYS AFTER THE INVASION, THE REMNANTS OF </p><p>KUWAITI LAND FORCES STRAGGLED ACROSS THE SAUDI BORDER AND </p><p>WERE EVENTUALLY COLLECTED IN HAFR AL-BATIN.  THROUGH THE </p><p>PAST THREE MONTHS THE GOK MADE A HIGH PRIORITY OF GETTING </p><p>THEIR FORCES REORGANIZED AND READY TO HELP LIBERATE THEIR </p><p>COUNTRY.  WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE SAUDIS THEY OBTAINED </p><p>PERMISSION FOR THE ENTRY OF U.S. TECHNICIANS, SPARE </p><p>PARTS, AND MUNITIONS FOR THE A-4 PROGRAM.  THE PLANES ARE </p><p>NOW FLYING AND PARTICIPATED IN THE RECENT EXERCISE WITH </p><p>U.S. FORCES.  A SENIOR KUWAIT OFFICIAL, WHO RECENTLY </p><p>DISCUSSED THIS SUCCESS STORY, RELATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE </p><p>SAUDIS HAD STRONGLY RESISTED MOVING THE A-4\'S FROM </p><p>SOUTHWESTERN SAUDI ARABIA TO THE EASTERN PROVINCE </p><p>PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE SAUDIS WERE AFRAID THE KUWAIT AIR </p><p>FORCE MIGHT PRECIPITATE HOSTILITIES WITH THE IRAQIS.  THE </p><p>KUWAIT OFFICIAL SAID THE GOK BROUGHT MAJOR PRESSURE TO </p><p>BEAR AT SENIOR LEVELS IN THE SAG TO FORCE THE SAUDIS TO </p><p>AGREE TO THE MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  SIMILAR DIFFICULTIES REPORTEDLY CONTINUE WITH EFFORTS </p><p>TO REORGANIZE KUWAITI LAND FORCES.  KUWAITI OFFICIALS </p><p>COMPLAIN THE SAUDIS ARE SLOW IN ANY DECISION RELATED TO </p><p>THIS EFFORT INCLUDING DELIVERY OF ITEMS NEEDED TO </p><p>RE-EQUIP THE NEW BRIGADES AS WELL AS LAUNCHING THE </p><p>TRAINING PROGRAM.  IN A RARE DISPLAY OF REAL ANGER TOWARD </p><p>THE SAUDIS, ANOTHER KUWAITI OFFICIAL ACCUSED THE SAUDIS </p><p>OF BLOCKING KUWAITI EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A TRAINING CAMP </p><p>FOR UP TO 30,000 NEW RECRUITS.  THE OFFICIAL SAID THE GOK </p><p>HAD BEEN PRESSING THE SAG FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS TO </p><p>PROVIDE A SITE WHERE BASIC TRAINING COULD TAKE PLACE; BUT </p><p>THE SAUDIS SEEMED OPPOSED TO SUCH AN EFFORT.  HE SAID THE </p><p>GOK WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS THE SAUDIS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  OVERALL:  CLOSE COOPERATION, DESPITE A FEW FRICTIONS </p><p>-   --------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>ALL IN ALL, GIVEN THE BIZARRE SITUATION, RELATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN KUWAITIS AND SAUDIS - AT LEAST FROM THE KUWAITI </p><p>PERSPECTIVE - REMAIN REMARKEDLY GOOD.  THE MANY AREAS OF </p><p>CLOSE COOPERATION AND INTERRELATIONSHIP REFLECT THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL MUTUAL INTERESTS OF THE TWO AS WELL AS THE </p><p>ADMITTEDLY DEPENDENT POSITION OF THE GOK AT THIS TIME. </p><p>MUCH OF THE NEGATIVES WE HEAR ARE EASILY UNDERSTOOD AS </p><p>STEMMING FROM CONTINUED KUWAITI FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE </p><p>EVOLVING CRISIS SITUATION.  MOST ARE TO BE EXPECTED AND </p><p>ON BALANCE IT IS SURPRISING HOW FEW PROBLEMS WE FIND.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME THERE ARE SOME FRICTIONS AND THEY WILL GROW </p><p>AS MORE TIME PASSES WITHOUT ANY DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE </p><p>CRISIS.  WE DO NOT, HOWEVER, EXPECT THESE FRICTIONS TO </p><p>AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY THE CLOSE COOPERATION THAT EXISTS </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS DURING THE CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  DOHA MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>GRIFFIN </p><p></p></div>
