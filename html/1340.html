THE RES REP TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT WHILE </p><p>THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS IN THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY IN </p><p>HARARE WHO WANT TO TAKE A WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE </p><p>REGARDING THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE, HE THINKS THAT A </p><p>MORE PROACTIVE RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR TO PREVENT A MAJOR </p><p>CRISIS.  THE AMBASSADOR WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREED WITH THE </p><p>RES REP AND THEY DECIDED TO SET-UP A NUMBER OF MEETINGS </p><p>AIMED AT BRINGING TOGETHER THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>(GOZ)/ZANU-PF, THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTY MOVEMENT </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO </p><p>DISCUSS WORKING TOGETHER ON A WAY FORWARD.  RES REP </p><p>ANGELO INFORMED THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE UN SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL (SG) WAS PLANNING ON SENDING A REPRESENTATIVE TO </p><p>HARARE ON NOVEMBER 17 TO ALSO TRY AND BREAK THE ICE </p><p>HERE, BUT THIS TRIP HINGES ON PRESIDENT MUGABE AGREEING </p><p>TO SEE THE SG\'S REP.

HE WAS ESPECIALLY WORRIED THAT </p><p>THE UNDP SECURITY OFFICER WHO IS THE LIAISON WITH THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE (ZRP) HAD INFORMED HIM THAT ZRP </p><p>RIOT UNITS HAD BEGUN RANGE TRAINING WITH LIVE </p><p>AMMUNITION, A PRACTICE NOT SEEN BEFORE.
