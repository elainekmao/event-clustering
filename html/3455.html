<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001515 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, PINR, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: Supreme Court Ruling Allows Dissolution of </p><p>Parliament to Stand, Elections to Proceed </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) Kathmandu 1146, B) Kathmandu 1005, C) Kathmandu </p><p> </p><p>740 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  On August 6, Nepal\'s Supreme Court </p><p>threw out four petitions challenging the Prime Minister\'s </p><p>May decision to dissolve Parliament.  The court\'s decision </p><p>cleared the way for national elections to be held later </p><p>this year.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Supreme Court Denies Request to Reinstate Parliament </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Nepal\'s Supreme Court on August 6 unanimously </p><p>dismissed four separate petitions challenging the May 22 </p><p>dissolution of the Lower House of Parliament (Ref A).  A </p><p>bench made up of eleven of the court\'s nineteen justices </p><p>reached the decision after more than six weeks of </p><p>deliberations.  The plaintiffs had included 56 Nepali </p><p>Congress Party Members of Parliament (MPs) aligned with </p><p>former Prime Minister G.P. Koirala, and a group of five </p><p>MPs from a small far-left party. </p><p> </p><p>Precedent Rules </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In its ruling, the court drew on the precedent it </p><p>set in 1994 when it upheld the decision of then-Prime </p><p>Minister G.P. Koirala to dissolve the lower house.  The </p><p>1994 decision paved the way for new national elections </p><p>later that year.  The court did, however, block subsequent </p><p>attempts to dissolve parliament, under somewhat different </p><p>circumstances, in both 1995 and 1998 (Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) As related in Ref A, legal experts had agreed </p><p>that this time Prime Minister Deuba stood on firmer legal </p><p>ground than the plaintiffs.  Even so, until the final hour </p><p>most observers were unsure which way the ruling would go. </p><p>Immediately after the decision was announced, one </p><p>prominent journalist commented that the court\'s strong </p><p>ruling was meant as a signal to dissuade politicians from </p><p>taking their political disputes to the bar. </p><p> </p><p>Journalists Left Outdoors as Decision Released </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Local Nepali journalists were incensed after </p><p>Supreme Court officials announced August 5 that no members </p><p>of the press would be permitted to attend the session </p><p>where the court\'s decision was released.  Officials </p><p>initially put off an Embassy request to attend the </p><p>session, but called Poloff only two hours before it began </p><p>to offer him a place.  Most of the seats in the galley </p><p>were taken by court employees.  A few local law students </p><p>were also permitted to attend.  A throng of journalists </p><p>crowded the court grounds, where they could listen to the </p><p>proceedings via loudspeaker. </p><p> </p><p>Legal Path to Elections Clear </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The dismissal of the four petitions clears the </p><p>way--legally speaking--for national elections scheduled </p><p>for November this year.  Substantial security, logistic </p><p>and resource constraints remain, however.  Further </p><p>complicating matters, an August 5 meeting of Nepal\'s </p><p>Cabinet decided to move ahead with preparations to hold </p><p>local elections (for village, city and district level </p><p>posts) within the current fiscal year, which ends July 15, </p><p>2003.  Post, including USAID, will continue working with </p><p>other donors to access Nepal\'s needs in regard to both the </p><p>national and local elections. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
