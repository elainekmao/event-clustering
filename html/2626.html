THE UNITED STATES STRESSED EFFECTIVE </p><p>ALLOCATION OF IFAD RESOURCES, A CONTINUED FOCUS ON </p><p>ASSESSING IFAD\'S IMPACT ON REDUCING RURAL POVERTY, AND </p><p>ENCOURAGED MANAGEMENT FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, </p><p>STRATEGIC PLANNING AND FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS.

FODAG STAFF ALSO ATTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  NIGERIAN PRESIDENT OBASANJO GAVE THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS </p><p>IN WHICH HE RECALLED NIGERIA\'S LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT </p><p>TO IFAD.  HE CALLED POVERTY THE MAIN CAUSE OF VIOLENCE, </p><p>INSECURITY AND TERRORISM AND STATED THAT, AMONG THE </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE ENABLING ENVIRONMENT IN COMMITMENT ONE OF </p><p>THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT PLAN OF ACTION, AN "ENABLING PEACE" </p><p>WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT. HE EMPHASIZED THAT ERADICATION OF </p><p>POVERTY WAS THE BEST WAY TO ERADICATE HUNGER AND POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT INVESTMENTS IN HEALTH AND EDUCATION WERE NOT </p><p>SUSTAINABLE UNLESS YOU WERE ABLE TO ALSO IMPROVE "HUMAN </p><p>ECONOMIC PRODUCTION."  OBASANJO RECALLED THAT FORMER </p><p>PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD TOLD HIM THAT ENDING THE WEST\'S </p><p>AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES WOULD INCREASE THE INCOME OF </p><p>DEVELOPING COUNTRY BY USD 20 BILLION/YEAR (COMMENT: A </p><p>POINT PICKED UP BY NUMEROUS SUBSEQUENT SPEAKERS.

SPEAKING AFTERWARDS IN HER OWN </p><p>CAPACITY, BERTINI REMINDED DELEGATES THAT THE BEST WAY TO </p><p>REDUCE HUNGER WAS TO SEND GIRLS TO SCHOOL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IFAD PRESIDENT LENNART BAGE (SWEDEN), SPOKE OF THE </p><p>NEED TO GIVE HOPE AND DIGNITY BACK TO THE RURAL POOR, </p><p>ENDORSED ACCESS FOR IFAD TO THE WORLD BANK HIPC (HIGHLY </p><p>INDEBTED POOR COUNTRY) TRUST FUND TO OFFSET IFAD HIPC </p><p>COSTS AND OBSERVED THAT THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR </p><p>SHOWED THAT "OUR RHETORIC HAS NOT BEEN MATCHED BY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01335  01 OF 03  151055Z </p><p>APPROPRIATE ACTION."

JACOBI STATED THAT THE DRAFT WAS THE </p><p>"MAXIMUM AGREEMENT POSSIBLE AMONG 189 COUNTRIES." SHE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS NOT "REVOLUTIONARY" BUT COULD BE </p><p>A PLATFORM FOR FORWARD LOOKING STEPS.  OTHER SPEAKERS </p><p>EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE DRAFT OUTCOME, </p><p>ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF LACK OF MOVEMENT ON ODA TARGETS AND </p><p>ON DEBT.  THE ROME-BASED BRAZILIAN PERMREP STATED WITH </p><p>VEHEMENCE THAT "ONE DEVELOPED COUNTRY" HAD DENIED ACCESS </p><p>TO NGO\'S DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS AND DERIDED WHAT HE </p><p>CALLED THAT COUNTRY\'S "DOUBLE STANDARD" CONCERNING NGO </p><p>PARTICIPATION.

ON THE SECOND DAY, MEMBERS SPLIT UP TO ATTEND FIVE </p><p>ROUNDTABLES ON REGIONAL STRATEGIES, WHICH FEATURED </p><p>SPEAKERS FROM GOVERNMENT, ACADEMIA, THE PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>AND NGO\'S.  PARTICIPANTS MADE SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING </p><p>THE REGIONAL STRATEGIES USING IFAD\'S PREPARED STRATEGIES </p><p>AS A BASIS FOR DISCUSSION.  COMMENT:  SOME INTERVENTIONS </p><p>WERE THOUGHTFUL; SOME WERE OF MARGINAL UTILITY (E.G., </p><p>VENEZUELA WANTED A REFERENCE TO "POLITICAL INSTABILITY" </p><p>DUE TO "COUP D\'ETAT\'S" DELETED FROM THE LATIN AMERICAN </p><p>STRATEGY PAPER); NONETHELESS, THE ROUNDTABLES ENABLED </p><p>DELEGATES TO ENTER INTO DEEPER DISCUSSIONS THAN THE </p><p>NORMAL GOVERNING COUNCIL FORMAT HERETOFORE HAD PROVIDED </p><p>AND FEATURED EXCELLENT SPEAKERS. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS CONCLUDED AMID SOME </p><p>CONFUSION AS TO THE STATUS OF THE COUNTRY STRATEGIES.  A </p><p>FEW LATIN COUNTRIES STATED THAT ADDITIONAL COMMENTS </p><p>(INCLUDING WRITTEN COMMENTS) WOULD BE MADE ON THE LATIN </p><p>AMERICAN REGIONAL STRATEGY, AND THAT THE STRATEGY WOULD </p><p>NOT BE CONSIDERED "APPROVED" UNTIL ALL COMMENTS HAD BEEN </p><p>RECEIVED AND A REVISED STRATEGEY CIRCULATED. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. STATEMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01335  02 OF 03  151056Z </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  AS A RESULT OF THE INNOVATIVE FORMAT (AND BECAUSE OF </p><p>TIME CONSTRAINTS), COUNTRY STATEMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE </p><p>PRESENTED FOR THE RECORD) WERE DISCOURAGED.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF IFAD MEMBERS (INCLUDING USDEL) MADE </p><p>FORMAL STATEMENTS.  HEAD OF DELEGATION WILLIAM SCHUERCH </p><p>DELIVERED THE U.S. STATEMENT.  HE NOTED THAT IFAD, WITH </p><p>ITS FOCUS ON RURAL POVERTY, WAS UNIQUE AMONG </p><p>INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND THUS WELL POSITIONED TO </p><p>PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MEETING THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT </p><p>GOALS. THE UNITED STATES ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>DEMONSTRATED INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND PUBLICLY </p><p>MEASURED RESULTS WOULD GENERATE GREATER CONFIDENCE AMONG </p><p>DONORS AND, MORE LIKELY, ENHANCE SUPPORT.  THE UNITED </p><p>STATES ALSO REINFORCED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FIFTH </p><p>REPLENISHMENT\'S PLAN OF ACTION, AND BROACHED THE IDEA OF </p><p>DISCUSSING WHETHER THE CURRENT "LIST" FORMAT (CATEGORIES </p><p>FOR DONORS, RECIPIENTS, AND THE OPEC GROUP) ACTUALLY </p><p>DIVIDED THE IFAD MEMBERSHIP ARTIFICIALLY AND IMPEDED </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.

THE COUNCIL ADOPTED WITHOUT DISCUSSION THE AUDITED </p><p>FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE PROPOSED ZERO REAL GROWTH </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE BUDGET FOR 2002 OF USD 41.7 MILLION </p><p>(INCLUDING CONTINGENCY FUND OF USD 165,000).
