FOR: NEA/IAI, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 83/001 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 06/07/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, XR, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN ENVOY VISITS ISRAEL; ISRAEL/VATICAN </p><p>RELATIONS DETERIORATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA JOSEPH MERANTE, REASONS E.O. 12958 1.5 </p><p>(B), (D). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03118  111552Z </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  POPE JOHN PAUL II DISPATCHED PIO CARDINAL LAGHI TO </p><p>MEET ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER SHARON AND PALESTINIAN </p><p>AUTHORITY CHAIRMAN ARAFAT ON JUNE 2.  VATICAN MIDDLE EAST </p><p>DIRECTOR MONS. GIOVANNI D\'ANIELLO ACCOMPANIED LAGHI. </p><p>CHARGE CALLED ON D\'ANIELLO JUNE 6 FOR READ-OUT OF TRIP. </p><p>D\'ANIELLO SAID THAT SOLE PURPOSE OF THE TRIP WAS TO EXPRESS </p><p>THE POPE\'S DESIRE THAT THE VIOLENCE STOP.  D\'ANIELLO SAID </p><p>THAT THE VATICAN DID NOT PROPOSE ANY NEW POLITICAL </p><p>SOLUTIONS TO THE ARAB/ISRAELI CONFLICT, AND DID NOT RAISE </p><p>ITS DESIRE TO SEE AN INTERNATIONAL FORCE DISPATCHED TO </p><p>ISRAEL AND THE TERRITORIES.  CHARGE ASKED ABOUT LAGHI\'S </p><p>STATEMENTS WHICH ISRAELI CONTACTS INTERPRET AS JUDGING </p><p>SETTLEMENT EXPANSION AS THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF THE SUICIDE </p><p>BOMBINGS.  D\'ANIELLO  SAID THAT LAGHI\'S INTENT WAS TO SAY </p><p>THAT BOTH THE VIOLENCE, AND THE "PROVOCATION" TO VIOLENCE, </p><p>MUST END.  D\'ANIELLO ADDED VERY LITTLE INSIGHT TO THE </p><p>VISIT, BUT DID SAY THAT THE VATICAN HAD NO PLANS TO </p><p>UNDERTAKE A SECOND MISSION. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  IN A FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATION, ISRAEL EMBASSY DCM ZVI </p><p>TAL GAVE A/DCM AN EARFUL OF HIS EMBASSY\'S VIEWS ON THE </p><p>DETERIORATION OF RELATIONS WITH THE HOLY SEE.  RECITING A </p><p>NUMBER OF SLIGHTS DATING BACK TO NOVEMBER 2000, TAL SAID A </p><p>PATTERN HAS EMERGED OF THE VATICAN BACKING OFF FROM ITS </p><p>PREVIOUS COMMITMENT TO CATHOLIC-JEWISH DIALOGUE.  BEGINNING </p><p>WITH THE VATICAN\'S REFUSAL TO COORDINATE WITH THE ISRAEL </p><p>EMBASSY A COMMEMORATION OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE PONTIFF\'S </p><p>HISTORIC VISIT TO THE HOLY LANDS, THROUGH A SERIES OF MINOR </p><p>SLIGHTS (LIKE NOT RECEIVING VISITING KNESSET MEMBERS) TO </p><p>THE QLACK OF BALANCEQ IN LAGHI\'S PUBLIC COMMENTARY THIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03118  111552Z </p><p>WEEK, TAL ASSERTED THAT THE VATICAN HAS BEEN CLOSING DOORS </p><p>ON DIALOGUE WITH THE GOI.  TAL SHARED WITH A/DCM A COPY OF </p><p>THE POPE\'S LETTER TO PM SHARON (FAXED TO EUR/WE), NOTING </p><p>THAT EVEN THAT MISSIVE CONTAINED THE QCODE WORD JUSTICEQ, </p><p>TO REFER TO A PERCEIVED VATICAN TILT TOWARDS THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  THE ISRAEL EMBASSY IS NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH </p><p>THE STATE OF RELATIONS, AND IF FEARFUL THAT THINGS COULD </p><p>GET WORSE.  TAL SAID HIS SOURCES INDICATE SECRETARY OF </p><p>STATE CARDINAL SODANO IS THE FORCE BEHIND THESE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS.  (NOTE: SODANO IS PM EQUIVALENT AND REGARDED </p><p>BY SOME AS A POSSIBLE PAPAL SUCCESSOR). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  COMMENT:  POST TOO HAS NOTED THAT THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>TILT TOWARD THE PALESTINIANS HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT MORE </p><p>EVIDENT.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR </p><p>THIS.  WE BELIEVE IT REFLECTS IN LARGE PART THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>UNDERSTANDABLE NEED TO MIND THE INTERESTS OF CHRISTIANS IN </p><p>THE HOLY LANDS.  IT MAY ALSO REFLECT A VATICAN POLICY TO </p><p>SUPPORT ARAFAT ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE EVIL YOU KNOW IS </p><p>BETTER THAN THE EVIL YOU DON\'T.  IT MAY REFLECT RESIDUAL </p><p>ANTI-SEMITIC ATTITUDES THAT STILL EXIST AMONG SOME WITHIN </p><p>THE VATICAN.  IT ALSO MAY REFLECT SODANO\'S OWN POLITICAL </p><p>MANEUVERING TOWARDS GREATER INFLUENCE, PERHAPS EVEN THE </p><p>PAPACY, IN THE WANING DAYS OF JP II\'S PONTIFICATE. </p><p>MERANTE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA03118 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
