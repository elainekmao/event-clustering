<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002878 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AF/W FOR PARKS, EPSTEIN </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: 2001 PDP CONVENTION: THE THRILL WAS GONE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) ABUJA 2832 </p><p>     B. (B) LAGOS 2815 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Timothy Andrews for reasons 1.6X6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: The 2001 Convention of the Peoples\' </p><p>Democratic Party (PDP) elected an unopposed slate of national </p><p>party leaders November 10. Yielding an outwardly harmonious </p><p>convention, there was little sign of the wrangling and </p><p>division that characterized the preceding four weeks of party </p><p>congresses (Ref A).  National Chairman Barnabas Gemade and </p><p>Party Secretary Okwesilieze Nwodo, succumbing to a </p><p>combination of pressure and promised emoluments, stepped down </p><p>prior to the Convention.  Conflicts in a dozen states at the </p><p>ward, local government and state party congresses did not </p><p>prevent the National Convention from moving forward. </p><p>However, some egos were bruised, and certain questions remain </p><p>open.   Resolving these problems will be high on the agenda </p><p>of Audu Ogbeh, the new Party Chairman, and Prince Vincent Eze </p><p>Ogbulafor, National Secretary.  Pre-convention internecine </p><p>friction had contributed to a rise in the overall political </p><p>temperature here.  The atmosphere has now cooled somewhat </p><p>thanks the orderly convention.  Still, Ogbeh, faces a hard </p><p>task. Ogbeh must rejuvenate a Party weakened by power plays </p><p>and the President,s often heavy-handed.  His first steps, </p><p>nullification of Party expulsions, may set a positive initial </p><p>direction.  Background on the PDP\'s first three years will be </p><p>provided Septel.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>ATMOSPHERE </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  The 2001 PDP Convention was a festive occasion, </p><p>resembling more a reception for three thousand than a </p><p>political convention.  Apart from a dour one-sentence </p><p>welcoming comment from outgoing National Chairman Barnabas </p><p>Gemade, speakers were upbeat and inspirational--the crowd </p><p>clearly thrilled to participate in the first PDP National </p><p>Convention since November 1999.  Obasanjo and Speaker Ghali </p><p>Na\'abba both appealed for Party unity, looked forward to </p><p>another successful 18 months of PDP leadership, and predicted </p><p>strong gains for the Party at all levels of government during </p><p>the 2003 election cycle.  Outside the venue, the throng of </p><p>thousands of Nigerians clamoring around the chain-link fence </p><p>was striking.  They seemed to want at least to be physically </p><p>near the often remote elites who are responsible for leading </p><p>Nigeria, and who have disappointed them so often in the past. </p><p> On more than one occasion, police were seen beating young </p><p>men trying to sneak into the venue or who were accused of </p><p>being on eof the ubiquitous pickpockets trying to steal from </p><p>the more affluent participants as they entered the </p><p>conventions jam packed main gate.  Meanwhile, away from the </p><p>actual convention site, functionaries from the state and </p><p>local levels crowded ministers\' residences and the liaison </p><p>offices of many states added to the celebrant atmosphere, </p><p>many of the functionaries spent a lot of time consuming vast </p><p>quantities of food and drink and leaving wrecked automobiles </p><p>scattered about the city. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Changing Partners </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Observers within and outside the Party were perplexed </p><p>by Gemade and Nwodo\'s stubborn bid to retain their positions </p><p>in the face of Presidential opposition.  (Gemade was </p><p>installed during the 1999 Party Convention in Jos only at the </p><p>President,s behest, and due to the deep pockets of his </p><p>political backers in the Party.)  PDP contacts told us that </p><p>both Gemade and Nwodo were promised ministerial positions to </p><p>end their reelection bids.  That they held on until nearly </p><p>the eleventh hour caused many to suspect that their bid to </p><p>remain was a desperate gambit to compel the President to </p><p>"sweeten" their severance packages.  Party insiders told us </p><p>that support for Gemade primarily came from PDP state </p><p>governors who, either due to non-performance or conflicts </p><p>with local power brokers, were unlikely to regain the party </p><p>nomination.  Senator Aniete Okon told Poloff, "Those guys </p><p>know that with Gemade, they can buy the nomination; with </p><p>Ogbeh, they can\'t." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  While it is typical for politicians here to engage </p><p>in brinkmanship before resolving a conflict, both the </p><p>President and Party officials considered Gemade\'s </p><p>rebelliousness to have been out-of-bounds, even by Nigerian </p><p>standards.  Given other current events -- the violence in </p><p>Benue state, and the dispute over electoral reform -- the PDP </p><p>leadership squabble was untimely, increasing political </p><p>tension at a moment when it was already high. In an attempt </p><p>to save his position, Gemade called an October 30 meeting of </p><p>the PDP National Executive Council and declared that the </p><p>Convention and Party congresses were suspended, and that </p><p>Minister of Works and Housing Anenih was expelled (Comment: </p><p>This was ironic. It was Anenih, by doling out cash during the </p><p>1999 convention, who did the leg work that got Gemade his </p><p>job.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C/NF) The following day, President Obasanjo called a </p><p>meeting of the Party Caucus--PDP governors, National Assembly </p><p>leaders, Party elders and key officials from the Executive. </p><p>Neither Gemade nor Nwodo were present.  The October 31 </p><p>session undid Gemade,s handiwork by moving to lift the court </p><p>injunction against Party congresses, reinstate Anenih, and </p><p>deciding to go ahead with the Party Convention as scheduled. </p><p>Gemade feebly contested the authority of the Caucus to make </p><p>those decisions, but the battle was over.  President Obasanjo </p><p>charged Deputy Senate President Ibrahim Mantu, a Middle Belt </p><p>politician from Plateau state to "settle" Gemade, so that the </p><p>convention would run smoothly.  Mantu told the Charge that he </p><p>had reiterated to Gemade the President\'s offer of a cabinet </p><p>position in exchange for the PDP leadership, but added that </p><p>he would wait until after the Convention to strongly advise </p><p>Gemade not to accept.  Gemade, Mantu noted, had proven </p><p>untrustworth and would not be tolerated as a colleague in the </p><p>cabinet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>A NEW HAND AT THE WHEEL </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Retired from active political life since being </p><p>Communications Minister under Shagari, New PDP chair Audu </p><p>Ogbeh is respected, unlike his more slippery predecessor. </p><p>During separate conversations with the Ambassador and the DCM </p><p>prior to his gaining the chairmanship, Ogbeh spoke frankly </p><p>about Nigeria,s political and economic health.  He </p><p>castigated Nigerian elites for being self-serving and for </p><p>abandoning their mostly rural fellow citizens to poverty and </p><p>malaise.  He placed primary responsibility for the parlous </p><p>economy on the elites -- both military and civilian -- who </p><p>have ruled the country over the past 30 years, and drew an </p><p>unequivocal connection between widespread poverty and the </p><p>ethnic and religious strife that has become far too common </p><p>during the Fourth Republic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  If he lives up to his reputation, Ogbeh will be much </p><p>better for the party than Gemade.  There are signs he already </p><p>is.  His first step as Party Chairman was to nullify all </p><p>previous expulsions from the Party in an attempt to instill </p><p>unity in the PDP as it gears up for elections.  Ogbeh will be </p><p>a key player in resolving intra-party disputes between PDP </p><p>office holders in different branches of government and </p><p>between rival state Party factions.  To do so effectively, he </p><p>must not adopt Gemade\'s role as the President\'s spokesperson </p><p>to the Party.  Yet, it is unclear how Obasanjo, who is </p><p>accustomed to having orders followed, will respond if Ogbeh </p><p>begins to act independently.  However, that Obasanjo wanted </p><p>Ogbeh indicates recognition of the drawbacks of Gemade and </p><p>those like him.  Ogbeh (like Gemade from Benue State) is </p><p>affable, low-key and appears capable of building consensus </p><p>and brokering compromises among competing interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>CONVENTION DAY: A FEW DISCORDANT NOTES </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  Among Ogbeh\'s first challenges will be resolving </p><p>disputes in the twelve states that failed to complete </p><p>elections of state PDP executive committees because of </p><p>irregularities at the ward, local government or state Party </p><p>level(s).  Some state Governors nullified outright the </p><p>results of ward congresses, like Plateau Governor Dariye and </p><p>Abia Governor Orji Kalu (Ref. B).  Others obeyed the </p><p>Gemade-orchestrated court order barring local government </p><p>congresses, and therefore were unable to conclude their </p><p>state-level congress and elect delegates for the Convention. </p><p>This unresolved factionalism produced the only bit of discord </p><p>during a National Convention otherwise characterized by an </p><p>almost festive parade of dignitaries pressing the flesh. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) At the Anambra State bleacher section, all seats were </p><p>occupied by supporters of Chief Emeka Offor, the former </p><p>patron but current adversary of Governor Chinwoke Mbadinuju. </p><p>Since Anambra did not complete the selection of delegates, </p><p>Offor\'s supporters--including Anambra\'s entire National </p><p>Assembly delegation-- refused to permit Mbadinuju or his </p><p>delegation to sit.  A standoff (or more accuratly , a sit </p><p>still, ensued.)  Both groups tried to out-chant the other. </p><p>Offor\'s contingent was larger and louder, although he was </p><p>installed in a seat by Mobile Police, Mbadinuju eventually </p><p>abandoned his State\'s delegation, chased away by cries, in </p><p>Igbo, of "Thief!"  Other states facing bitter conflicts </p><p>between incumbent governors and other party figures include </p><p>Plateau, Cross River, and Abia.  Several sources stated that </p><p>President Obasanjo wants all South-South governors replaced, </p><p>regardless of their party affiliation, because of their </p><p>insistence on being paid the full constitutional derivation </p><p>of 13 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Comment:  The Convention was an anticlimax to </p><p>several weeks of intramural tug of war in the party.  While </p><p>the PDP is far from fixed, at least it is still running. </p><p>President Obasanjo accomplished his mission ) an uneventful </p><p>convention, and the selection of Chairman and national </p><p>executive slate he wanted.  The convention, although orderly, </p><p>was neither very transparent nor democratic.  Selection of </p><p>party leaders was orchestrated from afar and not determined </p><p>by an open process.  This tack kept the convention from </p><p>denigrating into an unruly affair, and as such, it,s </p><p>probably a net positive.  However, underlying problems and </p><p>concerns about how the party is run and the relationship of </p><p>the party leadership to the presidential remain.  It is now </p><p>up to the President and new party hierarchy to continue to </p><p>mend today\'s wounds and, perhaps, shift the party to a more </p><p>transparent and democratic tomorrow. Septel offers an </p><p>overview of the evolution of the PDP over the past three </p><p>years that places current events in context. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
