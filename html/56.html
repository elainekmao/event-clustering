<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 02370 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTH LEBANON:  THE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL </p><p>CONTINUES WHILE NEW EFFORTS ARE MADE TO BRING PEACE </p><p>TO SIDON </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) BEIRUT 2330,  (B) TEL AVIV 6070 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ISRAEL REPORTEDLY CONTINUES CONTACTS AIMED AT </p><p>USING INDIGENOUS FORCES TO MAINTAIN BORDER SECURITY </p><p>AFTER THE JUNE 1 WITHDRAWAL OF ISRAELI TROOPS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO LOCAL PRESS, THE ISRAELIS HAVE REACHED </p><p>A COMPROMISE WITH THE DRUZE OF THE HASBAYA REGION </p><p>WHEREBY THE DRUZE INHABITANTS WILL FORM A </p><p>"CIVIL GUARD," BUT WILL NOT HAVE DIRECT TIES TO THE </p><p>ASL OR ANY OTHER ISRAELI-BACKED ORGANIZATION.  IF </p><p>THESE REPORTS ARE TRUE, THIS DEAL REPRESENTS A VICTORY </p><p>FOR THE LOCAL DRUZE WHO HAVE ALLEGEDLY BEEN RESISTING </p><p>ISRAELI PRESSURE (WHICH INCLUDED A BLOCKADE OF THE </p><p>VILLAGES OF AKA KAMA AND MIMAS) TO RECRUIT THEM INTO </p><p>THE ASL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE JAZZIN AREA, LOCAL PRESS REPORTS THAT </p><p>EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO ESTABLISH A 300-400 MAN </p><p>CHRISTIAN FORCE INDEPENDENT OF THE ASL.  THESE </p><p>REPORTS SUPPORT OTHER INFORMATION THE EMBASSY HAS </p><p>RECEIVED CONCERNING A DEAL ALLEGEDLY STRUCK BETWEEN </p><p>WALID JUMBLATT AND THE CHRISTIANS OF JAZZIN CONCERNING </p><p>SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR JAZZIN AND THE IQLIM </p><p>AL-KHARRUB.  DETAILS WERE REPORTEDLY HAMMERED OUT AT </p><p>A MEETING HELD LAST WEEK IN MUKHTARA ATTENDED BY </p><p>JUMBLATT, JEAN AZIZ, JAZZIN DEPUTY EDMOND RIZK, AND </p><p>AN UNIDENTIFIED ISRAELI OFFICER.  AT THIS MEETING, </p><p>JUMBLATT REPORTEDLY ACCEPTED THE FORMATION OF THIS </p><p>CHRISTIAN FORCE, PROVIDED IT HAD NO OVERT CONNECTION </p><p>WITH THE ASL; HE ALSO APPARENTLY SAID HE WOULD NOT </p><p>ATTACK THE CHRISTIANS OF THE JAZZIN AREA OR THE </p><p>IQLIM AL-KHARRUB AND OFFERED TO OPEN THE CHUF ROAD TO </p><p>CHRISTIAN TRAFFIC IF THE COASTAL ROADS WERE CLOSED TO </p><p>THEM.  IN RETURN, JUMBLATT ASKED FOR AN OPEN ROAD </p><p>FROM THE CHUF TO THE DRUZE VILLAGES OF HASBAYA AND </p><p>ROSHAYYA IN THE SOUTH, AND REMOVAL OF LF ELEMENTS </p><p>FROM OUTSIDE THE AREA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN SIDON, THE TWO AXES OF CONFRONTATION REMAINED </p><p>ACTIVE OVER THE WEEKEND.  ONE FRONT PITS LF FIGHTERS </p><p>IN THE VILLAGES OF ABRA, HLALIYAH, AND QAYYA </p><p>(SOUTHEAST OF SIDON) AGAINST SUNNI AND PALESTINIAN </p><p>MILITIAMEN SUPPORTED BY THE LAF\'S SUNNI TAWEED 98TH </p><p>BRIGADE FROM TRIPOLI LOCATED ON THE HILL OF MAR ELIAS. </p><p>ON THE OTHER FRONT, ALSO LOCATED IN THE EASTERN </p><p>SUBURBS, LF MILITIAMEN BASED IN THE VILLAGES OF </p><p>MIYAH MIYAH, MAGHDUSHEH, AND DARB AL-SIM CONFRONT THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN CAMPS OF MIYAH MIYAH AND AYN AL-HILWAH. </p><p>ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY, FOR THE FIRST TIME, 155 MM </p><p>SHELLS FELL ON THE LAF\'S ZGHAYB BARRACKS IN CENTRAL </p><p>SIDON.  LOCAL PRESS REPORTS CASUALTY FIGURES AS </p><p>HIGH AS 26 KILLED AND WOUNDED IN WEEKEND FIGHTING. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ON THE POLITICAL FRONT, SIDON DEPUTY NAZIH BIZRI, </p><p>CLAIMING TO HAVE LOST ANY HOPE FOR LAF REINFORCEMENT </p><p>OR LF WITHDRAWAL, CALLED APRIL 19 ON THE </p><p>CITIZENS OF SIDON TO TAKE UP ARMS IN THEIR OWN </p><p>DEFENSE.  USAMA SAAD, VP OF THE "NASSERITE POPULAR </p><p>ORGANIZATION," WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED BIZRI TO DAMASCUS </p><p>EARLIER IN THE WEEK, ALSO CALLED UPON THE AREA\'S </p><p>CHRISTIAN VILLAGERS "TO FORCE THE LF FROM THEIR </p><p>VILLAGES SO THEY DON\'T BECOME THE TARGETS OF A </p><p>MILITARY SOLUTION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN CONTRAST TO THE INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC EMANATING </p><p>FROM SIDON\'S MUSLIMS, THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY SEEMS </p><p>INTENT ON DAMPING DOWN THE LEVEL OF TENSION. </p><p>FOLLOWING A VISIT TO ISRAEL (REF B) DURING WHICH </p><p>HE WAS REPORTEDLY WARNED BY THE ISRAELIS NOT TO </p><p>MAKE TROUBLE IN SIDON, AND AFTER A WEEKEND OF </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH FORMER PRESIDENT CAMILLE CHAMOUN, </p><p>SAMIR JA\'JA\' HELD A MORNING PRESS CONFERENCE ON </p><p>APRIL 22 TO ANNOUNCE LF MEASURES AIMED AT DEFUSING THE </p><p>CRISIS.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE TEXT OF JA\'JA\'S </p><p>STATEMENT, WE UNDERSTAND THESE TO INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>--  A.  A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE EFFECTIVE 1600 LOCAL </p><p>TIME ON APRIL 22; </p><p> </p><p>--  B.  A WITHDRAWAL OF NON-INDIGENOUS LF FORCES FROM </p><p>THE SIDON AREA BEGINNING 1100 LOCAL TIME ON APRIL 23. </p><p>THIS WITHDRAWAL IS IN ORDER TO "GIVE THE CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT A CHANCE TO UNDERTAKE ITS RESPONSIBILITIES." </p><p>(MILITIAMEN NATIVE TO THE AREA WILL REMAIN); </p><p> </p><p>--  C.  A CALL FOR THE PRESIDENT, PM, GOVERNMENT, AND </p><p>LAF COMMAND TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR SECURITY </p><p>VIOLATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>JA\'JA\' FURTHER STATED HIS HOPE THAT THESE MEASURES </p><p>WOULD CONSTITUTE A FIRST STEP TOWARD A SETTLEMENT </p><p>AND CALL FORTH PEACE INITIATIVES FROM THE OTHER </p><p>PARTIES INVOLVED.  HE INVITED JOURNALISTS TO WITNESS </p><p>TOMORROW\'S WITHDRAWAL. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ON THE MILITARY LEVEL, THE QUADRIPARTITE MILITARY </p><p>COMMISSION IS REPORTED BY THE PRESS TO BE WORKING </p><p>FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL LAF UNIT TO </p><p>SIDON.  NO DETAILS OF ARMAMENT OR CONFESSIONAL </p><p>COMPOSITION ARE AVAILABLE.  IN ANY EVENT, PAST HISTORY </p><p>INDICATES THAT IT CANNOT BE DEPLOYED IN THE ABSENCE </p><p>OF A PRIOR POLITICAL AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ONE USUALLY WELL INFORMED LOCAL PRESS SOURCE TELLS </p><p>US THAT SYRIA IS TRYING TO PUT IN PLACE A SCENARIO </p><p>WHEREBY SUNNIS OF SIDON CAN CLAIM VICTORY OVER THE LF </p><p>AS A SOP FOR RECENT SUNNI LOSSES IN WEST BEIRUT.  THE </p><p>PRICE OF SUCH A DEAL, HOWEVER, IS ALLEGED TO BE </p><p>RENUNCIATION BY SUNNIS OF THEIR LINKS WITH PRO-ARAFAT </p><p>PLO PALESTINIANS AND ACCEPTANCE OF RELIANCE UPON DRUZE </p><p>AND ABU MUSA PALESTINIANS IN THEIR STEAD.  THE ALTERNA- </p><p>TIVE, ACCORDING TO THIS SOURCE, IS FOR DRUZE, ABU MUSA </p><p>MILITIA, AND AMAL TO ADMINISTER THE SAME LESSON IN </p><p>SIDON THAT THEY DID IN WEST BEIRUT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN TYRE, ISRAELI FORCES CONTINUE THEIR </p><p>PREPARATIONS FOR WITHDRAWAL.  IDF SPOKESMEN HAVE </p><p>ANNOUNCED A WITHDRAWAL DATE OF APRIL 24, BUT ACTIVITIES </p><p>ON THE GROUND INDICATE IT MAY OCCUR UP TO 24 HOURS </p><p>EARLIER.  ALL BUILDINGS AND INSTALLATIONS OF </p><p>POTENTIAL USE TO THE RESISTANCE ARE BEING DYNAMITED, </p><p>THERE IS AS YET NO WORD ON POSSIBLE LAF DEPLOYMENT </p><p>AFTER THE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL. </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
