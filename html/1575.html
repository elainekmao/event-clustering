<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 001390 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (VAN CLEVE); NEA/IAI; NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KIRF, IT, IS, SY, VT, religious freedom </p><p>SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN\'S VISIT TO IRAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY CDA JOSEPH MERANTE FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(A) AND (D) . </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CHARGE CALLED ON VATICAN DIRECTOR OF MIDDLE </p><p>EASTERN AFFAIRS MONS. GIANNI D\'ANIELLO ON MARCH 12 TO </p><p>DISCUSS FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN\'S MARCH 3-8 TRIP TO IRAN. </p><p>D\'ANIELLO, WHO ACCOMPANIED THE FOREIGN MINISTER, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01390  121701Z </p><p>CATEGORIZED THE VISIT AS "HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL".  HE SAID </p><p>THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE VISIT WAS TO LOBBY FOR INCREASED </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR CATHOLICS, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER </p><p>CHRISTIANS IN IRAN.  ACCORDING TO D\'ANIELLO, THE LARGEST </p><p>GROUPS IN COMMUNION WITH ROME ARE THE CHALDEANS, SOME </p><p>MELKITES, AND EUROPEANS WHO WOULD BE MEMBERS OF THE LATIN </p><p>CHURCH.  TWO OTHER MAIN BODIES OF CHRISTIANS ON WHOSE </p><p>BEHALF THE VATICAN WANTED TO SPEAK ARE THE ASSYRIAN </p><p>CHURCH OF THE EAST, AND THE SYRIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. </p><p>D\'ANIELLO SAID THAT IN GENERAL, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR </p><p>THESE CHRISTIAN GROUPS WAS NOT GREATLY CURTAILED, AND THE </p><p>IRANIAN GOVERNMENT PROMISED EVEN GREATER LATITUDE.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT HE AND TAURAN FOUND STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS INDICATIVE OF AN EVOLVING OPENNESS ON THE PART </p><p>OF IRAN, BUT ADDED THAT THE VATICAN IS STILL UNSURE IF WE </p><p>CAN EXPECT CONTINUED OPENNESS OR A RETURN TO MORE </p><p>REACTIONARY POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) D\'ANIELLO SAID THAT TAURAN RAISED THE SITUATION OF </p><p>THE IRANIAN JEWS WHO WERE SENTENCED FOR SPYING FOR ISRAEL </p><p>DIRECTLY IN A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>KHATAMI.  HE SAID THE PRESIDENT WAS NONCOMMITTAL. </p><p>HOWEVER, ON THE ISSUE OF THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS, </p><p>D\'ANIELLO SAID THAT IRAN AGREES WITH THE VATICAN, THAT </p><p>THE VIOLENCE MUST END AND THAT THE TWO PARTIES RESUME </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  D\'ANIELLO USED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY </p><p>THAT HE "WASN\'T SPEAKING OFFICIALLY" BUT THAT THE VATICAN </p><p>IS HAVING INCREASED CONCERNS THAT IN AN ULTIMATE </p><p>AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES, THE CHRISTIANS OF </p><p>JERUSALEM WILL BE "LEFT OUT".  HE ASKED THAT WE PAY </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF ALL THREE RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01390  121701Z </p><p>ANY DISCUSSIONS IN WHICH THE U.S MIGHT TAKE PART. (NOTE: </p><p>THIS DIM VIEW OF THE MEPP WAS ALSO REFLECTED IN A 3/11 </p><p>DINNER CONVERSATION ACTING DCM HAD WITH ISRAELI EMBASSY </p><p>DCM. THE ISRAELI DCM RELATED THAT THE VATICAN HAD </p><p>REBUFFED THE ISRAELI EMBASSY\'S ATTEMPTS TO SECURE A </p><p>LOCATION IN VATICAN CITY TO HOLD AN EVENT COMMEMORATING </p><p>THE LST ANNIVERSARY OF THE POPE\'S VISIT, SAYING THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE DID NOT "VIEW THAT VISIT AS A SUCCESS.") </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CHARGE CALLED AUSTRIAN DCM LATER IN THE DAY TO GET </p><p>READOUT OF FM TAURAN\'S MORNING BRIEFING ON THE TRIP TO EU </p><p>EMBASSIES.  ACCORDING TO AUSTRIAN DCM, TAURAN SAID HE </p><p>RAISED 1) IMPORTATION OF BIBLES; 2) THE NEED FOR A </p><p>JUDICIAL STATUS FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN IRAN; 3) </p><p>RETURN OF SOME PROPERTIES CONFISCATED AFTER THE 1979 </p><p>REVOLUTION. HE ALSO TOLD THE EU AMBASSADORS THAT KHATAMI </p><p>SAID THE SENTENCES OF THE IRANIAN JEWS WERE "FINAL", BUT </p><p>"EARLY PARDON" SHOULD NOT BE RULED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) D\'ANIELLO ALSO USED THE VISIT TO PRESENT A NOTE </p><p>VERBALE ON THE CASE OF ZIVKOVICH AND ALPERIN VS. THE </p><p>IOR.(SEPTEL TO FOLLOW, NOTE FAXED TO EUR/WE, L/DL 3/12). </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: A MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY GOAL OF THE </p><p>VATICAN IS PROTECTION OF THE CHRISTIANS IN ISLAMIC </p><p>COUNTRIES.  THUS, IN THOSE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES, SUCH AS </p><p>IRAN AND IRAQ, IN WHICH THE VATICAN BELIEVES THE STATUS </p><p>OF CHRISTIANS IS NOT GREATLY COMPROMISED, WE SHOULD </p><p>EXPECT VATICAN ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT.  MERANTE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01390  121701Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA01390 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
