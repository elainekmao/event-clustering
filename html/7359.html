<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISTANBUL 000508 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PGOV, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: SUB-GOVERNORS SURVEY SECURITY AND POLITICS IN </p><p>ISTANBUL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CG David Arnett for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: In recent meetings, several of Istanbul\'s </p><p>kaymakams (sub-governors) were surprisingly open in </p><p>describing the challenges they face in overseeing proper </p><p>functioning of the security apparatus.  Pointing to a massive </p><p>rural-urban migration to Istanbul over the past several </p><p>decades as a central source of difficulty, the kaymakams </p><p>discussed their concerns related to street children and </p><p>crimes committed by minors; proper handling of demonstrations </p><p>and protests; rural-urban migration; and improving police </p><p>training.  All were eager to underline their firm belief that </p><p>Turkey and the U.S. would remain close allies and friends </p><p>despite recent difficulties in the relationship.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Istanbul\'s Sub-Districts </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  Poloff recently met with kaymakams for Bagcilar, </p><p>Sisli, and Kadikoy districts in Istanbul.  The three </p><p>districts, very different in terms of income levels, </p><p>commercial interests, and location, roughly mirror the </p><p>diversity of economic conditions among Istanbul\'s </p><p>12-million-plus population.  Bagcilar, located on the </p><p>northwestern edge of Istanbul\'s European side, is a classic </p><p>gecekondu (literally "landed at night," a neighborhood of </p><p>recent arrivals to the city, often interspersed with </p><p>squatters and small businesses).  Sisli, in central European </p><p>Istanbul, has both a thriving commercial district and </p><p>residential areas spanning the entire range of incomes, from </p><p>very poor to affluent.  Its population of 300,000 people </p><p>swells to one million during the day, as workers crowd in </p><p>from outlying areas.  Kadikoy, a central district on the </p><p>Asian side, has a variety of retail and commercial </p><p>businesses, a pedestrian neighborhood and shoreline area </p><p>popular with locals, and a largely middle-class residential </p><p>area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Bagcilar and Gaziosmanpasa </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Poloff met April 3 with Bagcilar\'s acting kaymakam, </p><p>Aziz Inci.  Inci said that most residents of neighborhoods </p><p>like Bagcilar are immigrants from Turkey\'s rural areas and </p><p>Southeast, with few adults born in Istanbul.  Inci believes </p><p>that most come to Istanbul for economic reasons, and that </p><p>"security reasons" as a justification for migration ended in </p><p>about 1995. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Inci views the primary challenge of his job as one of </p><p>providing infrastructure.  Working to solve shortcomings in </p><p>education, health, and social services, and combating </p><p>joblessness, are his main preoccupations.  In order to make </p><p>necessary improvements, as kaymakam he must often work not </p><p>only with the governor\'s office, but also with neighboring </p><p>kaymakams and the Istanbul mayor in order to deal with </p><p>cross-cutting issues such as electricity, transportation, and </p><p>sewage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) One way in which kaymakams come into direct contact </p><p>with political parties is through such development projects. </p><p>Inci said that local political party offices often show </p><p>interest when the kaymakam is making decisions on where to </p><p>improve infrastructure, or whom to hire for certain </p><p>contracts.  Additionally, political parties seek to </p><p>"bandwagon" onto successful projects, claiming them as their </p><p>own initiatives to score points with the local electorate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Sisli </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Sisli kaymakam Osman Demir also pointed to </p><p>infrastructure development as a key need for Istanbul\'s </p><p>social development, and also as a means of enhancing </p><p>security.  Demir expressed concern about what he perceives to </p><p>be a growing pattern of criminal activities among minors. </p><p>Demir pointed to economic hard times, a burgeoning youth </p><p>population, and lighter punishments on young offenders as </p><p>causes of this problem.  Demir believes some criminal </p><p>elements are recruiting minors to avoid harsher punishments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Demir pointed to a continuing presence of illegal </p><p>immigrants in Istanbul as a major problem.  Sisli has a </p><p>number of night clubs in the Elmadag neighborhood that have </p><p>performers and some prostitutes from the former Soviet Union. </p><p> Additionally, garment and leather businesses in the </p><p>Nisantasi neighborhood cater to suitcase traders from the </p><p>same countries, and signs in Russian are nearly as frequent </p><p>as Turkish or English. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Demir argued that trafficking in Istanbul is largely </p><p>voluntary.  He laid out several "typical" scenarios, which </p><p>include Chinese workers attempting to enter Europe by </p><p>transiting Istanbul, and women from the former Soviet Union </p><p>working as shuttle traders in Istanbul, and occasionally </p><p>"raising capital" by engaging in prostitution.  Demir felt </p><p>that both local and international mafia have a hand in this </p><p>ongoing problem, but that economic under-development in </p><p>neighboring countries was its major impetus.  (As kaymakam, </p><p>Demir oversees the security apparatus for the Sisli district, </p><p>and has intimate personal knowledge of all significant </p><p>arrests, detentions, and police investigations within the </p><p>area.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Kadikoy </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Kadikoy Kaymakam Yuksel Peker was surprisingly frank </p><p>about problems of police administration and human rights. </p><p>Peker conceded that torture in Turkey is still a problem, but </p><p>argued it can be solved by proper education.  "Police, in </p><p>their zeal to extract information, believe that torture is </p><p>the best option.  Training them in other methods of proper </p><p>interrogation will stop them," he suggested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Peker, like his other colleagues, believed that many </p><p>of Istanbul\'s current social ills are caused by severe </p><p>pressures brought about by massive rural-urban migration.  He </p><p>echoed their belief that infrastructural improvements will do </p><p>much to ease these pressures, and encourage law-abiding </p><p>behavior. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>What\'s a kaymakam? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Kaymakams (sub-governors) are chiefs of Ministry of </p><p>the Interior offices in Turkey\'s provincial sub-divisions, </p><p>and thus formally the chief representatives of the Turkish </p><p>State below the level of governors.  Career civil servants, </p><p>they must be university graduates of public administration or </p><p>political affairs faculties.  They may be graduates of either </p><p>public or private universities.   Upon graduation, they take </p><p>an entrance exam to enter the kaymakam program, and then </p><p>begin an approximately one-month training program at the </p><p>Ministry of the Interior in Ankara.  Kaymakams generally </p><p>aspire eventually to be appointed as governors.  Early in </p><p>their careers, they usually do a one-year training program in </p><p>the U.S. or U.K. to study Anglo-Saxon local administration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) A kaymakam\'s career usually moves geographically from </p><p>East to West.  After completing MoI training in Ankara, a </p><p>young kaymakam is typically posted somewhere in the rural </p><p>southeast.  Throughout the region, kaymakams are generally </p><p>young men in their late-20s to early 30s.  Though technically </p><p>in charge of the security apparatus throughout the </p><p>sub-district (sometimes a very large geographic area), </p><p>kaymakams in this period of their careers are heavily </p><p>supervised by governors and deputy governors in the </p><p>provincial capitals.  At the same time, they are somewhat </p><p>eclipsed by a security apparatus that, while respectful to </p><p>them as the future governors of Turkey, keeps them somewhat </p><p>distant from direct control over jandarma and other security </p><p>operations.  On one occasion, poloff met with a jandarma </p><p>colonel and kaymakam simultaneously.  While technically of </p><p>higher rank, the kaymakam was deferential to the colonel, who </p><p>was both older and more experienced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) A young kaymakam understands his limitations: he is a </p><p>colonel without a regiment, charged not with independent </p><p>decision making on security matters, but with communicating </p><p>the governor\'s instructions to the local security apparatus, </p><p>and reporting back on the local situation.  "Do well in small </p><p>matters and you will be rewarded" is the order of the day.  A </p><p>young kaymakam looks to onward assignment as a deputy </p><p>governor or a kaymakam in a more comfortable location.  On </p><p>more than one occasion, young kaymakams and deputy governors </p><p>asked poloff about an American FSO\'s career track, and </p><p>claimed to see strong similarities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) As a kaymakam\'s career progresses, the geography </p><p>changes, with postings in Turkey\'s coastal areas and larger </p><p>cities.  While poloff estimates that median age for a </p><p>kaymakam in the rural Southeast is just over 30 years old, </p><p>Istanbul\'s kaymakams average close to 50.  Previous posts for </p><p>kaymakams poloff spoke with in Istanbul include the Aegean </p><p>area, Ankara and Istanbul. </p><p>15. (C) MoI civil servants who pursue this career path </p><p>typically display an awareness of Turkish ethnic and </p><p>geographical diversity that may be lost on many of the </p><p>Ankara-Istanbul elite and even on many governors.  While </p><p>typically Kemalist in outlook, they often exhibit a clear </p><p>understanding of the problems that have given rise to </p><p>conflict and political instability.  Uniformly, when speaking </p><p>about political unrest in both rural and urban settings, </p><p>kaymakams have stressed to poloff their belief in the </p><p>importance of opportunity for Kurdish and Turkish poor, </p><p>stating that they believe their role in apportioning funds </p><p>for development projects to be very important in enhancing </p><p>security and discouraging extremism.  Improvements in </p><p>education, state-funded health care, and physical </p><p>infrastructure are thus key concerns for kaymakams throughout </p><p>Turkey. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
