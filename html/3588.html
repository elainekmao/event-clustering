<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001963 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, EB </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>EB FOR U/S LARSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: BIOTECH STILL UNDER FIRE IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Distinguishing drought from </p><p>      famine" an op-ed by Tajudeen Abdul-Raheem carried in </p><p>      the August 27 edition of the independent daily "The </p><p>      Daily News," accuses the United States of "cynically </p><p>      exploiting the plight of the starving to create an </p><p>      artificial market for its genetically modified foods." </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "There is famine in a number of southern African </p><p>      countries with Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and Angola </p><p>      more affected than the rest. Whatever the reasons for </p><p>      the famine, people are suffering and they need help. </p><p>      But should this be help at all cost and by whatever </p><p>      means?  I do not think so.  The U.S. Government has </p><p>      been quick to offer help in the form of genetically </p><p>      modified (GM) maize.  Zimbabwe rejected it initially </p><p>      and Angola expressed its concern and only last week </p><p>      Zambia also rejected it.  On the surface it looks like </p><p>      these governments are behaving as though beggars can </p><p>      choose.  With Zimbabwe the demonization of President </p><p>      Mugabe internationally made him `the usual suspect,\' </p><p>      but I do not think that everything the government of </p><p>      Zimbabwe or Mugabe does is bad.  There are legitimate </p><p>      issues about GM foods which millions of people in the </p><p>      USA and Europe are unwilling to eat.  Why should </p><p>      Africa be the dumping ground or the experimental </p><p>      laboratory? </p><p> </p><p>      "Humanitarian agencies are claiming that GM </p><p>      foods should be accepted because it is better </p><p>      than nothing and because people are starving. </p><p>      A very persuasive argument at the emotional </p><p>      level, but it does not address the scientific </p><p>      health concerns about GM foods.  Also let us </p><p>      change the context of the appeal.  Imagine a </p><p>      predominantly Muslim country is suffering </p><p>      drought, could the people be persuaded to eat </p><p>      pork on the grounds of this is what is </p><p>      available?  Or could Hindus be white-mailed </p><p>      into eating beef even if it is the only food </p><p>      available?  GM foods are not the only available </p><p>      food surplus in the world and even in Africa </p><p>      itself.  The USA is cynically exploiting the </p><p>      plight of the starving to create an artificial </p><p>      market for its GM foods and promote the </p><p>      corporate sharks pushing this food of dubious </p><p>      nutritional and health value." </p><p> </p><p>      3.  Comment:  Mr. Abdul-Raheem usually writes </p><p>      more reasonable, better-informed opinion </p><p>      pieces.  PAO has responded to the fallacies in </p><p>      this piece and has invited Mr. Abdul-Raheem to </p><p>      discuss biotech and food security issues in </p><p>      greater depth.  We will also invite him to </p><p>      attend the August 30 television interactive </p><p>      program with U/S Larson.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
