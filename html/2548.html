<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000693 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/EPS: DRIANO; OES/IHA:KAUFMANN; USAID/AFR:RROGERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KHIV, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GLOBAL FUND PROPOSALS FORTHCOMING </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 23248 (B) STATE 30290 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Economic and Political sections consulted with USAID and </p><p>CDC Nigeria to gather information in response to Ref B. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(A) It appears that the highest levels of the GON have been </p><p>aware of the Global Fund request for proposals for some time, </p><p>although the March 10 deadline was less widely understood. </p><p>The President recently instructed the Minister of Health, who </p><p>is ex-officio Secretary to the Presidential Committee on </p><p>AIDS, to submit proposals before that deadline. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(B) According to Ministry of Health officials, NGOs and civil </p><p>society will not have an opportunity to provide input for </p><p>this first round of proposals.  However, civil society will </p><p>be asked to contribute to the second tranche due June 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C) The Process: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The GON, under the leadership of the Minister of Health, has </p><p>completed proposals for malaria and tuberculosis and is </p><p>currently drafting HIV/AIDS proposals.  Specifics for the </p><p>malaria and TB proposals are not known.  The HIV/AIDS </p><p>proposals will likely revolve around (1) prevention and (2) </p><p>care and support.  Care and support programs would focus on </p><p>voluntary counseling and testing; anti-retroviral access; and </p><p>prevention of mother-to-child transmission.  The National </p><p>Action Committee on AIDS (NACA) is responsible for drafting </p><p>the HIV/AIDs proposals and will submit them to the Minister </p><p>of Health before approval by the President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NACA is a multi-sectoral body comprised of 10 federal </p><p>ministries augmented by NGO participation and established as </p><p>part of the national strategy to combat HIV/AIDS.  The </p><p>creation of NACA enables the GON to participate in the World </p><p>Bank\'s Multi-sectoral AIDS Program (MAP), resulting in the </p><p>provision of USD 90 million in IDA credits for FY2001/02. </p><p>NACA will disburse these funds, as well as USD 40 million of </p><p>GON funds for HIV/AIDS, through the State Action Committees </p><p>(SACAs) to civil society and Local Government Action </p><p>Committees (LACAs).  Programs at the State and local levels </p><p>are coordinated and overseen by NACA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>One criterion for the Global Fund proposals is the formation </p><p>of a Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM).  NACA could </p><p>qualify as a Country Coordination Mechanism, but the Minister </p><p>of Health has decided to create a new mechanism.  The reasons </p><p>behind this decision are not known, but could be due to </p><p>bureaucratic politics as the relationship between the Health </p><p>Ministry and NACA has not always been smooth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(D) The GON does not require assistance to submit proposals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(E) The Ministry of Health asked the CDC to assist in the </p><p>preparation of the tuberculosis proposals.  However, CDC </p><p>representatives were out of the country at that time and </p><p>were, therefore, unable to assist. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(F) The GON requested input from the wider donor community on </p><p>the tuberculosis proposals.  For the malaria proposals, the </p><p>GON requested assistance from UNICEF and BASICS, a USAID </p><p>implementing partner, and both provided input.  The GON is </p><p>working with UNAIDS on the HIV/AIDS proposals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(G) The GON is aware of the search for an Executive Director, </p><p>but has not announced any intention to submit a candidate. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
