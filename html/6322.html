<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000430 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  03-13-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Tigers still seem on board for talks at this </p><p>point, but situation remains volatile </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 421, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In the aftermath of the sinking of one </p><p>of their ships, the Tigers have withdrawn cadre from </p><p>areas in the north/east.  At this point, they still seem </p><p>willing to attend the talks due to be held March 18-21 </p><p>in Japan.  A Norwegian team is in country, trying to </p><p>keep things afloat.  The situation is volatile, but the </p><p>Tigers appear unlikely to break contact.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) TIGERS WITHDRAW PERSONNEL.  Reverberations from </p><p>the GSL navy\'s sinking of a Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) ship on March 10 continue to rock the peace </p><p>process.  (Note:  Despite Tiger claims that it was a </p><p>"merchant" vessel, the ship was almost certainly </p><p>carrying a large quantity of arms when it was </p><p>intercepted off Sri Lanka\'s northeast coast.  The ship\'s </p><p>11-member LTTE crew is presumed dead -- see Reftels.) </p><p>In an apparent sign of the group\'s anger over the </p><p>incident, the LTTE has ordered its political cadre based </p><p>in government-controlled areas of the north and east to </p><p>return to the LTTE-controlled Wanni region.  Initially, </p><p>it was thought that the move was made so cadre could </p><p>attend a briefing.  Sources in the north and east </p><p>report, however, that the move seems much more long-term </p><p>based on the fact that the cadre took their office </p><p>equipment and furniture with them.  The Tigers have not </p><p>issued a statement explaining their action, but contacts </p><p>believe the group is trying to send a message to the </p><p>government that all is not well with the peace process </p><p>following the March 10 incident. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In addition to withdrawing their personnel, </p><p>the Tigers are showing their displeasure in other ways. </p><p>On March 12, the group sponsored a hartal (strike) in </p><p>Jaffna protesting the sinking of the ship.  The hartal </p><p>closed down shops and schools in the Jaffna area.  Black </p><p>flags were put up and students put on black armbands. </p><p>While it was disruptive, no violence was reported.  The </p><p>LTTE is also sponsoring a hartal in the major north- </p><p>central town of Vavuniya today (March 13). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) TALKS SEEM TO BE ON.  Despite their latest </p><p>moves, the Tigers still seem to be planning to </p><p>participate in the sixth round of GSL-LTTE talks </p><p>scheduled to take place in Japan, March 18-21.  In a </p><p>March 12 posting, TamilNet, a pro-LTTE website, cited </p><p>Tiger chief negotiator Anton Balasingham as stating that </p><p>the Tigers were upset with the sinking of the ship, but </p><p>still wanted "to participate constructively in the peace </p><p>process."  Balasingham went on to indicate that the </p><p>Tigers would participate in the talks.  (Note:  In an </p><p>interview with BBC, Balasingham seemed a bit testier, </p><p>indicating that the Tiger leadership was still examining </p><p>whether to attend the talks.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) For its part, the government seems relatively </p><p>confident that the talks will take place.  On March 13, </p><p>Ambassador Bernard Goonetilleke, the chief of the </p><p>government\'s Peace Secretariat, told us that as far as </p><p>he knew the talks were a "go."  He said the Tigers had </p><p>just provided the GSL a list of names for their </p><p>delegation.  (Note:  As with previous rounds, the list </p><p>includes Balasingham, political chief S.P. </p><p>Thamilchelvam, and Karuna, the eastern commander.)  In </p><p>addition, the LTTE had requested hotel rooms at the </p><p>Hakone, Japan, resort where the talks are scheduled to </p><p>be held.  Goonetilleke allowed that the Tigers could </p><p>easily still change their minds (see Para 6 below), but </p><p>he thought they would attend the talks "because it was </p><p>very much in their interest to discuss the assistance- </p><p>related issues that will be on the agenda." </p><p>(Note:  The sixth round is slated to focus on the </p><p>delivery of development assistance, resettlement issues, </p><p>human rights, and defense-related matters, inter alia.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) NORWEGIAN TEAM ARRIVES.  As part of Norway\'s </p><p>ongoing peace facilitation effort, Deputy Foreign </p><p>Minister Vidar Helgesen has arrived in Sri Lanka for a </p><p>March 12-16 visit.  (Note:  Foreign Minster Petersen was </p><p>supposed to lead the GoN peace facilitation team during </p><p>the long-planned visit, but had to cancel because of the </p><p>Iraq situation.)  The visit has taken on a new sense of </p><p>urgency due to the March 10 incident, and Helgesen is </p><p>doing his best to ensure that there is no breakdown in </p><p>the peace process.  His most critical meeting is on </p><p>March 13, when he meets with LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran </p><p>and Balasingham in the Wanni.  According to Ambassador </p><p>Goonetilleke, it will be the Helgesen-Prabhakaran </p><p>meeting which will determine whether the LTTE will, in </p><p>fact, attend the March 18-21 talks and, if so, what will </p><p>be on the agenda.  While in Sri Lanka, Helgesen is also </p><p>scheduled to meet with President Kumaratunga and to </p><p>travel to sites in the southern part of the country.  He </p><p>met with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe on March 12. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In the meantime, the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM) has also been engaging the </p><p>LTTE.  New SLMM chief Major General (retd) Tryggve </p><p>Teleffsen met with political chief Thamilchelvam on </p><p>March 12 in the Wanni town of Kilinochchi.  The meeting </p><p>focused on ways to avoid a repeat of the March 10 </p><p>incident.  SLMM spokesman Teitur Torklesen told us that </p><p>the meeting was "productive." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  There is little doubt that the LTTE is </p><p>in a deeply angry mood.  Natural bullies, the Tigers </p><p>viscerally dislike coming up with the short end of the </p><p>stick in any confrontation.  That said, despite some </p><p>rumors to the contrary, most observers we have touched </p><p>base with believe that the LTTE is unlikely to break </p><p>contact over the March 10 incident.  The feeling is that </p><p>the group has invested a lot in the process and does not </p><p>want to let go just yet.  The situation is highly </p><p>volatile, however, and it still seems possible that a </p><p>hard-line response could prevail in Tiger councils, as </p><p>it has many times before.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
