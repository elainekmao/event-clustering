<p>S E C R E T THE HAGUE 001997 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 X5, X6 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, MNUC, ETTC, BE, NL, MTCRE </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH ON INTERDICTION OF MISSILE RELATED CHEMICAL </p><p>(S) </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 228758 </p><p>     B. BRUSSELS 3874 </p><p>     C. STATE 226538 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR MARY DALY FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B AND D) </p><p> </p><p>(S)  PolMilOff made ref A demarche to Dutch MFA </p><p>Nonproliferation Director Paul Wilke and Dutch MEA Policy </p><p>Advisor Diana Gosens on August 7.  Wilke and Gosens said that </p><p>the GONL would not be initiating a formal investigation into </p><p>this matter because MEG is not subject to any Dutch licensing </p><p>controls. Gosens subsequently emphasized with PolMilOff that </p><p>the Dutch position was that this was not an illegal export. </p><p>That said, Dutch Customs had visited the exporter Brenntag\'s </p><p>offices in Dordrecht, Netherlands and copied files which they </p><p>will share with Belgian colleagues.  Gosens said she had also </p><p>spoken with Brenntag which claims the end user is the Syrian </p><p>Ministry of Industry.  Gosens claimed that had the Dutch </p><p>government been aware of USG concerns while the shipment was </p><p>on Dutch territory, and given that the end user was the </p><p>Government of Syria, it was likely the GONL would have held </p><p>up the shipment under a catch all provision.  She said she </p><p>had conveyed this message to her Belgian MFA colleague Paul </p><p>Huynen.  At this point, the Dutch view this matter as being </p><p>in the hands of their Belgian colleagues. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
