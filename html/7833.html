THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) BRIEFED </p><p>PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES APRIL 29, 2003 ON THE HIV/AIDS </p><p>CRISIS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, AND FAO\'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>ISSUE.  THE MESSAGE: HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA NEEDS TO BE </p><p>ADDRESSED THROUGH A MULTI-SECTORAL APPROACH.  ONE-THIRD OF </p><p>THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR POPULATION IN AFRICA\'S HARDEST HIT </p><p>COUNTRIES WILL PROBABLY BE DEAD IN FIVE YEARS; BETTER </p><p>NUTRITION COULD HELP EXTEND LIVES; GREATER HOUSEHOLD FOOD </p><p>SECURITY COULD ALLEVIATE THE NEED TO ENGAGE IN RISKY </p><p>SURVIVAL STRATEGIES SUCH AS PROSTITUTION.  PER FAO: MORE </p><p>RESOURCES ARE NEEDED.  MISSION WELCOMES FAO\'S INCREASED </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THIS ISSUE. FAO IS WELL POSITIONED TO </p><p>ESTABLISH STANDARD INDICATORS AND METHODS FOR INCORPORATING </p><p>HIV/AIDS INTO FOOD SECURITY, CROP AND VULNERABILITY </p><p>ASSESSMENTS. UNDOUBTEDLY, MORE AND BETTER ESTIMATES OF THE </p><p>MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF AIDS ON A GIVEN COUNTRY\'S </p><p>AGRICULTURAL SECTOR ARE NEEDED TO FULLY UNDERSTAND ITS </p><p>INCREASINGLY DEVASTATING ECONOMIC IMPACT. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FAO STAFF MEMBERS FROM THE POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01908  01 OF 03  051425Z </p><p>SERVICE, THE HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY SERVICE, AND THE </p><p>EMERGENCY DIVISION BRIEFED ROME PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>APRIL 29 ON THE HIV/AIDS CRISIS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, AND </p><p>FAO\'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE ISSUE.  ACCORDING TO THE FAO TEAM, </p><p>"ALL FAO TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING IN SOME SENSE ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE; AND IT AFFECTS ALL COUNTRIES THAT FAO WORKS IN." </p><p>THE BRIEFING FOCUSED ON SOUTHERN AFRICA BECAUSE OF AIDS </p><p>SEVERE PREVALENCE IN THAT REGION AND ITS AFFECT ON HEALTH, </p><p>SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND AGRICULTURE.   IT WAS NOTED THAT IN A </p><p>REGION WHERE SOME 80 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION DEPENDS ON </p><p>AGRICULTURE, SOME COUNTRIES ALREADY HAD AN INFECTION RATE OF </p><p>39 PERCENT.  FAO DIRECTOR OF POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>MARCELA VILLAREAL COMMENTED: "WE THOUGHT BEFORE THAT THERE </p><p>WOULD BE SOME [NATURAL] LIMIT TO THE INFECTION RATE; NOW, WE </p><p>DON\'T KNOW WHERE IT WILL STOP." </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>WHY FAO? </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>3.   THE FAO PRESENTATION EMPHASIZED THE LINK BETWEEN </p><p>HIV/AIDS AND FOOD SECURITY.  AT THE INDIVIDUAL AND HOUSEHOLD </p><p>LEVEL, INFECTION REDUCES THE CAPACITY TO PRODUCE FOOD; </p><p>HOUSEHOLD RESOURCES ARE SOLD OFF TO BUY FOOD; CHILDREN ARE </p><p>TAKEN OUT OF SCHOOL TO WORK.  AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL, THE </p><p>PANDEMIC UNDERMINES THE TRANSMISSION OF AGRICULTURAL KNOW- </p><p>HOW BETWEEN GENERATIONS; EFFECTIVE FARMING TECHNIQUES ARE </p><p>LOST.  AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, EXTENSION WORKERS ARE DYING, </p><p>PRODUCTION SYSTEMS CHANGING, WITH FEWER WORKERS, A MORE </p><p>NARROW RANGE OF CROPS ARE BEING GROWN, REDUCING GENETIC </p><p>DIVERSITY.  AS AIDS STRIKES DURING PRODUCTIVE YEARS, THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01908  01 OF 03  051425Z </p><p>IMPACT ON AGRICULTURAL LABOR IS SEVERE - FAO CALCULATES THAT </p><p>THE NINE HARDEST HIT AFRICAN COUNTRIES MIGHT LOSE UP TO A </p><p>FOURTH OF THEIR AGRICULTURAL LABOR BY 2020.  HOWEVER, IT IS </p><p>NOTED THAT THE RATE IS HIGHLY UNEVEN BETWEEN COUNTRIES.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, IN UGANDA, THE CURRENT MORTALITY RATE IS EXPECTED </p><p>TO REMAIN STABLE; IN NAMIBIA AND MOZAMBIQUE, THE MORTALITY </p><p>RATE IS EXPECTED TO "SOAR." </p><p> </p><p>4. THE FAO STATED THAT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE WERE </p><p>ALREADY TO BE SEEN - LESS LAND CULTIVATED, A SHIFT TO LESS </p><p>LABOR INTENSIVE CROPS, CULTIVATION OF A NARROWER RANGE OF </p><p>CROPS, AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF HIRED LABOR, MORE </p><p>DEFAULTING ON LOANS, DEFLATED LAND PRICES, LOWER </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, INCREASED FOOD INSECURITY, AND </p><p>HIGHER MALNUTRITION RATES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>HIV/AIDS AND FOOD INSECURITY: A "DEADLY CYCLE" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5.

HOWEVER, THEY ARGUE, </p><p>IF INTERVENTIONS ARE MADE TO REDUCE FOOD INSECURITY AND </p><p>IMPROVE NUTRITION, LIFE SPANS WOULD BE LENGTHENED SOMEWHAT </p><p>BY SLOWER PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE; HOPEFULLY INFECTION </p><p>RATES WOULD BE INFLUENCED BY A DECLINE IN "RISKY SURVIVAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES" AND LESS ECONOMIC MIGRATION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE FAO PRESENTERS STATED THAT HERETOFORE THE GLOBAL </p><p>RESPONSE HAS BEEN PRIMARILY HEALTH-CARE BASED, WITH HEALTH </p><p>LEADING THE MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIES.  HOWEVER, A MEDICINE </p><p>BASED-SOLUTION WAS "FAR FROM REALISTIC IN AFRICA," </p><p>PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE NEED FOR FOOD AND CLEAN WATER TO EVEN </p><p>TAKE THE PRESCRIBED MEDICINE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>A NEW AGRICULTURAL PARADIGM NEEDED </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.

ACCORDING TO THE PRESENTATION, FAO\'S WORK HAS PRIMARILY </p><p>BEEN ADVOCACY, AWARENESS-RAISING AND INFORMATION </p><p>DISSEMINATION.  FAO STAFF MEMBERS EMPHASIZED THAT THE HEALTH </p><p>SIDE FOCUS PERTAINED TO WHO, AND FAO WORK DID NOT OVERLAP. </p><p>FAO HAS PUBLISHED RESEARCH SINCE 1988 ON THE IMPACT OF </p><p>HIV/AIDS ON FOOD SECURITY AND AGRICULTURE; PROVIDED TRAINING </p><p>AND INFORMATION MATERIALS ON ISSUES SUCH AS LAND TENANCY AND </p><p>LAND OWNERSHIP; PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURAL </p><p>MINISTRIES ON MITIGATION, PREVENTION.  INTERNALLY FAO HAS </p><p>ATTEMPTED TO ENSURE THAT THE ISSUE IS "MAINSTREAMED" IN ALL </p><p>DIVISIONS (IT WAS NOTED THAT THE 2001 COMMITTEE ON WORLD </p><p>FOOD SECURITY AND THE 2002 FAO REGIONAL CONFERENCE IN AFRICA </p><p>PROVIDED A MANDATE FOR THE FAO TO FOCUS SPECIAL ATTENTION ON </p><p>HIV/AIDS).  FAO RECENTLY PUBLISHED A PAMPHLET ON ENSURING </p><p>GOOD NUTRITION FOR HIV/AIDS SUFFERERS, SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED </p><p>FOR LOW-INCOME RURAL FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01908  02 OF 03  051425Z </p><p>9.  AS FAR AS FIELD ACTIVITIES, THE PRESENTATION MENTIONED </p><p>AN HIV/AIDS COMPONENT IN THE SPECIAL PROGRAMS FOR FOOD </p><p>SECURITY IN MOZAMBIQUE AND KENYA, POLICY ADVICE ON HOUSEHOLD </p><p>FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN MOZAMBIQUE AND ZAMBIA AND </p><p>WORK ON GENDER EQUALITY ISSUES IN NAMIBIA, UGANDA AND </p><p>ZAMBIA.
