<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001702 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EIND, ECON, YM, ECON/COM </p><p>SUBJECT: MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND TRADE ON YEMEN\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>OUTLOOK </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Begin summary:  Ambassador and USAID Representative </p><p>met with newly-appointed Minister of Industry and Trade Dr. </p><p>Khaled Rajeh Sheik on July 12.  The courtesy call was part of </p><p>a series of discussions with newly-appointed ROYG officials </p><p>to ascertain their priorities and convey U.S. commitment to </p><p>development and security.  Issues discussed included the </p><p>creation of tourist zones, the World Economic Forum, Yemen\'s </p><p>accession into the WTO, PL-480, and USAID\'s mission.  Also in </p><p>attendance were Dr. Abdul Ghani and PolOff (notetaker).  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Industrial Zones </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  During a 7/12 courtesy call, Ambassador </p><p>congratulated Dr. Khaled Rajeh Sheik on his appointment as </p><p>Minister of Industry and Trade, and welcomed the opportunity </p><p>to discuss the Minister\'s program.  Sheik announced a ROYG </p><p>plan to establish three industrial zones - one each in Aden, </p><p>Hodeidah, and Mukalla.  ROYG will initiate this process, he </p><p>explained, by creating laws to legalize such areas.  The goal </p><p>is to create profit generating ventures like Jabil Ali in </p><p>Dubai, but on a much smaller scale. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Sheik also discussed the importance of connecting </p><p>Yemen to her gulf neighbors, noting that regional trade was </p><p>only in its infancy.  He mentioned ongoing trade in fruits </p><p>and vegetables, but noted that trade in meat was forbidden </p><p>because of cases of Rift Valley disease in the region, </p><p>especially in Saudi Arabia.  However, he added, smuggling of </p><p>meat does occur.  Overall, said the Minister, "with ongoing </p><p>projects with the European Union (EU) and the World Bank, </p><p>ROYG is on the right track." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Ambassador agreed that U.S.-Yemen cooperation on </p><p>industrial zones may be a possibility.  An initial focus </p><p>should be on improving Yemen\'s image in the world arena with </p><p>development and security initiatives -- for example, by </p><p>increasing maritime security with the creation of a Yemen </p><p>Coast Guard.  Other initiatives designed to improve technical </p><p>skills, like community colleges, he added, are also important </p><p>to long-term success.  Concurrently, the Ambassador suggested </p><p>highlighting a successful Yemeni corporation like the Hayeel </p><p>Saeed Company to further strengthen Yemen\'s public image. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>World Economic Forum </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Minister Sheik positively reflected on his </p><p>experience as head of Yemen\'s delegation to the World </p><p>Economic Forum in June.  He said that Yemen, Jordan, and </p><p>other Arab countries supported the remarks made by Secretary </p><p>Powell, and agreed upon the importance of cooperation. </p><p>Citing a WEF debate on the effects of terror on trade, Sheik </p><p>welcomed U.S. support for ROYG industries that have been </p><p>affected by terror.  He also expressed interest in the </p><p>free-trade zone outlined by Secretary Powell at WEF, although </p><p>he noted that a great deal of work would be required to bring </p><p>the proposal to fruition. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>World Trade Organization </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Minister Sheik confirmed that ROYG has asked the </p><p>U.S., the EU, and Australia to support Yemen\'s accession into </p><p>the World Trade Organization (WTO).  He said that ROYG is </p><p>committed and will continue to engage until an agreement has </p><p>been reached, and while the average period before accession </p><p>is six years, ROYG wants to see Yemen accede in as little as </p><p>three. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>PL-480 </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Announcing $15 million (USD) in funds for PL-480 in </p><p>FY-2004, Ambassador said these funds should be used to </p><p>encourage sustainable development in Yemen.  He stressed that </p><p>the health of the Yemen economy is internally and externally </p><p>significant because security, financial and political </p><p>stability, and investor confidence are all interrelated. </p><p>Ambassador noted that USAID has experience in this type of </p><p>development and AID Yemen would tap experience elsewhere -- </p><p>e.g. Egypt. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>USAID </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  USAID Representative Douglas Heisler explained that </p><p>USAID\'s development plan for Yemen is two-fold: 1) </p><p>short-term: strenghtening the local level, including </p><p>agriculture and agriculture-related business; and 2) </p><p>long-term: working with ministries, the World Bank, and other </p><p>donors to identify long-term opportunities for sustainable </p><p>trade and investment. </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
