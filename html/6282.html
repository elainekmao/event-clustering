END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Regional RefCoord Assistant met with Seeds of Peace\'s </p><p>Coexistence Center Program Director Ned Lazarus and Senior </p><p>Program Officer Jen Marlowe January 27 to monitor PRM-funded </p><p>activities at the Jerusalem Center for Coexistence.  Because </p><p>the political and the security situation on the ground has </p><p>not changed since our last report (ref b), Seeds of Peace </p><p>continues to face difficulties in bringing together Israeli </p><p>and Palestinian Seeds for coexistence activities. </p><p>Nevertheless, Seeds of Peace maintained communication links </p><p>between Israeli and Palestinian youth through chatting on </p><p>the Seeds of Peace (SOP) website and writing to the SOP bi- </p><p>annual Olive Branch magazine.  Through these activities, </p><p>Palestinian and Israeli Seeds also develop their writing </p><p>skills and learn international perspectives on other </p><p>relevant issues through virtual contact with Seeds from 23 </p><p>different countries. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In spite of travel restrictions in the West Bank and </p><p>Gaza, 90 of the 116 Seeds who participated in the SOP summer </p><p>camp 2002 managed to meet regularly in different locations. </p><p>Israeli and Palestinian residents of Jerusalem held their </p><p>meetings at the Seeds Center in Jerusalem, while Arab and </p><p>Jewish Israelis met in northern and southern Israel.  Since </p><p>Palestinian participants from the West Bank and Gaza could </p><p>not move out of their towns, Lazarus and Marlowe conducted </p><p>regional check-in meetings with the Seeds in their towns -- </p><p>Ramallah, Beit Jala, Abu Dis, Nablus and Gaza -- to share </p><p>what they have been facing in recent months, how they have </p><p>met the challenges they confront, what discourages and </p><p>inspires them, and how to stay connected to the other Seeds, </p><p>to the organization and to each other. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Marlowe and Lazarus reported that social pressures have </p><p>made it difficult for some Palestinian Seeds to continue </p><p>their coexistence activities.  Those in Gaza were not able </p><p>to talk with the Palestinian community at all about their </p><p>activities in the SOP, while others in Ramallah and Nablus </p><p>were less restricted.  Nevertheless, Palestinians showed </p><p>commitment to the program, attending town hall meetings and </p><p>expressing their willingness to continue working with the </p><p>values and culture of Seeds of Peace.  Lazarus said that the </p><p>SOP values become part of the Seeds\' identity. </p><p> </p><p>5.  In order to compensate for the difficult circumstances, </p><p>Seeds of Peace also went beyond its traditional approach of </p><p>meetings between the Seeds themselves by holding unilateral </p><p>and joint Israeli-Palestinian meetings for the Seeds parents </p><p>and families.  Seeds held joint Hanukah and Ramadan </p><p>celebrations, gathering 150 Seeds and their families for an </p><p>evening of `oud music and food, forging trusting connections </p><p>between the parents.  Seeds of Peace also held a seminar on </p><p>community activism in Jericho, where Palestinian Seeds heard </p><p>from panels of their peers and professionals about </p><p>meaningful ways to contribute to their community that are </p><p>consistent with the values of Seeds of Peace.  The seminar </p><p>was followed by a voluntary project at a school in the Ein </p><p>el-Sultan refugee camp, where the Seeds painted a new UNRWA </p><p>school building.  60 Seeds from Gaza and the West Bank as </p><p>well Palestinians studying in Jordan participated in that </p><p>event. </p><p> </p><p>6.  According to Lazarus and Marlowe, Seeds of Peace intends </p><p>to apply for another PRM grant to send 10 refugee children </p><p>to its 2003 summer camp in Maine.  Seeds would like to give </p><p>priority to refugees from the Palestinian camps in the West </p><p>Bank and Gaza, but continued travel restrictions could make </p><p>this difficult.  SOP management is therefore considering </p><p>expanding its program to Palestinian residents of refugee </p><p>camps in Jordan. </p><p>7.
