<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001287 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S (KRAFT), AF/PD (COX AND ROBERTSON) </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNOUNCES </p><p>DRASTIC CUTS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) On May 25 the government-owned Zimbabwe </p><p>    Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) announced massive </p><p>    staffing cuts and personnel changes.  According to </p><p>    Information Minister Jonathan Moyo, the de-facto </p><p>    director of all government-owned media, approximately </p><p>    60 percent of the ZBC\'s 900 employees will be laid </p><p>    off.  Moyo, however, sought to reassure threatened </p><p>    employees with an Orwellian statement: "What the ZBC </p><p>    has announced are not plans to retrench (lay workers </p><p>    off), they have announced an action programme in the </p><p>    on-going restructuring exercise."  The Minister also </p><p>    said he was sure that "..the on-going restructuring </p><p>    exercise -- in particular the retrenchment process -- </p><p>    will boost morale." </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) Among the casualties are several high-profile </p><p>    appointments made at the ZBC\'s November 2001 </p><p>    restructuring.  Chief among these is ZBC news editor- </p><p>    in-chief Shepherd Mutamba, appointed to that key </p><p>    position 7 months ago in during the ZBC\'s previous </p><p>    pogrom.  He was perceived to be a protg of Minister </p><p>    Moyo, but in early May he conducted a tough television </p><p>    interview with the controversial Minister.  Among </p><p>    other issues, Mutamba asked about the intent of the </p><p>    "Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Bill" </p><p>    and the perception that Minister Moyo is opposed to </p><p>    freedom of expression.  In the wake of that interview, </p><p>    an article in the independent weekly "Standard" </p><p>    predicted major changes at the state-owned media.  Two </p><p>o </p><p>    journalists from that newspaper were arrested and </p><p>    charged with "publishing falsehoods" for reporting </p><p>    imminent changes at ZBC.  We will watch to see if </p><p>    those charges are dropped now that the story has been </p><p>    confirmed. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) Comment:  ZBC has steadily lost </p><p>    credibility, audience and income in the last two </p><p>    years.  Radio and television programs featuring live </p><p>    calls from the public were canceled because of the </p><p>    broadcaster\'s ban on dissenting views and criticism. </p><p>    Current events and discussion programs sponsored by </p><p>    advertisers or NGOs were canceled because, in the </p><p>    words of Minister Moyo, "we do not want to be a </p><p>    cultural colony of advertisers."  Commercial </p><p>    advertising diminished and was replaced by ruling </p><p>    party-produced music videos extolling the virtues of </p><p>    the "fast-track" land re-distribution program.  News </p><p>    and editorial opinion were merged into a pre- </p><p>    masticated TV dinner that viewers have, apparently, </p><p>    found unappetizing and indigestible.  Lack of funds </p><p>    has also forced ZBC TV to dig deeply into their tape </p><p>    library.  American sitcoms from the early 1970s, </p><p>    largely irrelevant to Zimbabwe or the year 2002, now </p><p>    form the basis of ZBC\'s entertainment programming. </p><p>    The corporation is currently pursued by a number of </p><p>    creditors, has had to take out emergency bank loans to </p><p>    meet April and May payrolls, and has been reduced to </p><p>    siphoning gasoline from inoperable Outside Broadcast </p><p>    Vans in order to fuel reporters cars. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) Comment continued:  While firing 60 percent </p><p>    of its staff will eventually reduce the payroll, the </p><p>    broadcaster will first need to find funds to pay </p><p>    separation benefits.  Minister Moyo has a plan: </p><p>    "Retrenchments will have to be financed by finding the </p><p>    money somewhere, one way or the other."  A solution to </p><p>    the ZBC\'s larger problem, restoring credibility, </p><p>    audience and the ability to generate income, remains </p><p>    even more vague. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
