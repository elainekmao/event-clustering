<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001049 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR CWC DEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, ABUD, JO, AROC, CWC, CBW, OPCW </p><p>SUBJECT: CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION (CWC): JORDANIAN </p><p>RESPONSE TO QUESTIONNAIRES ON NATIONAL MEASURES FOR CWC </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 35668 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) On February 17, Poloff delivered reftel points and </p><p>copies of OPCW Technical Secretariat (TS) questionnaires to </p><p>Ayman Aamiri, Deputy Director of the MFA\'s IO Department.  On </p><p>February 18, Poloff followed up on this issue with Jusuf </p><p>Bataineh, the MFA\'s action officer on CWC issues.  Bataineh </p><p>apologized for Jordan\'s tardiness in responding to the OPCW </p><p>questionnaires thus far and identified bureaucratic problems </p><p>within the GOJ as the cause of the delay. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) According to Bataineh, when Jordan originally signed </p><p>the CWC, it formed a "National Authority for the </p><p>Implementation of the CWC" headed by a special office within </p><p>the Jordan Armed Forces (JAF) GHQ.  Under that original </p><p>configuration the system worked well, Bataineh said, and the </p><p>GOJ was able to respond to CWC-related inquiries in a timely </p><p>manner.  Later, a decision was made to shift the authority\'s </p><p>leadership from the JAF to the Ministry of Interior, after </p><p>which (for reasons Bataineh did not specify) inter-agency </p><p>cooperation broke down.  At present, the MFA is seeking </p><p>approval from the PM\'s office to have Jordan\'s Civil Defense </p><p>Authority take over the lead for CWC matters and hopes that </p><p>this will result in a better run, more responsive, CWC </p><p>national authority.  Bataineh stressed to poloff that "we are </p><p>in regular contact with the PM\'s office on this.  It\'s at the </p><p>top of our agenda."  He said that Jordan understands the </p><p>importance of the OPCW questionnaires and all its obligations </p><p>under the CWC and hopes to have responses ready shortly. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Bataineh also noted that the OPCW has invited Jordan </p><p>to participate in a CWC workshop at the Hague in May. As </p><p>presently envisioned, he and an official from Civil Defense </p><p>will represent the GOJ. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
