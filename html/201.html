<p>UNCLAS ADDIS ABABA 01180 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, ET </p><p>SUBJECT:  ETHIOPIA:  1987 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 42318  B) STATE 54781 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SINCE THE DAYS OF EMPEROR HAILE SELASSIE, </p><p>ETHIOPIA HAS TAKEN A STRONG ANTI-TERRORIST </p><p>STANCE, LARGELY BECAUSE IT BELIEVES ANY SHOW </p><p>OR WEAKNESS TO TERRORISTS WOULD SERVE AS A STIMULUS </p><p>TO THE VARIOUS ARMED INSURGENT GROUPS WITHIN </p><p>ETHIOPIA.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, ETHIOPIA HAS BEEN </p><p>FREE OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST OPERATIONS SINCE </p><p>THE DAYS OF HAILE SELASSIE WHEN SEVERAL HIJACKINGS </p><p>WERE FORCEFULLY REPRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  LIBYA HAS FOUR OFFICERS ACCREDITED </p><p>AT ITS PEOPLE\'S BUREAU IN ADDIS ABABA AND </p><p>ITS HEAD IS THE VICE DEAN OF THE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>CORPS.  LIBYA HAS A JOINT AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PROJECT WITH ETHIOPIA, BUT THE NUMBER OF </p><p>LIBYANS INVOLVED IS UNKNOWN.  ETHIO-LIBYAN </p><p>RELATIONS HAVE BEEN AT A LOW POINT FOR THE </p><p>PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND THE LIBYA-ETHIOPIA-PDRY </p><p>TRIPARTITE PACT HAS BEEN  MORIBUND FOR SOME TIME. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE PLO OPENED ITS ONE-PERSON OFFICE IN </p><p>ETHIOPIA IN 1978  BASED ON ITS OBSERVER </p><p>STATUS AT THE OAU.  THE PLO IS NOT INCLUDED </p><p>IN THE DIPLOMATIC LIST AND DOES NOT ENJOY </p><p>OTHER DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE PLO LOST THE HOUSE </p><p>AND CAR PROVIDED BY THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>AFTER THE PLO OFFICE IN PYONGYANG DISTRIBUTED </p><p>A MAP OF ETHIOPIA WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE ERITREA </p><p>AS A PROVINCE.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO </p><p>CONFIRM THAT REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE BUREAU OF THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE </p><p>LIBERATION OF PALESTINE HAS ALSO MAINTAINED A </p><p>ONE-PERSON OFFICE HERE SINCE 1978.  IT HAS NO </p><p>DIPLOMATIC STATUS, BUT WE UNDERSTAND THE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IS PROVIDED WITH A HOUSE BY THE </p><p>ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
