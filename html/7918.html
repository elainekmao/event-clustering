<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002752 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR A/S QUARLES </p><p>NSC FOR EDSON/HADLEY </p><p>STATE FOR A/S BURNS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SUPPLEMENTAL ESF FOR JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 2717 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 2569 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 2363 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  On May 6, Embassy shared with Ministers Marto and </p><p>Awadallah drafts sent from Washington of the bilateral </p><p>transfer agreement that would govern the $700 million FY03 </p><p>emergency supplmental ESF transfer.  The most recent draft </p><p>includes among the policy measures that the GOJ must execute </p><p>prior to disbursing the final $200 million the stipulation </p><p>that the "IMF Executive Board must approve completion of the </p><p>Third Review under Jordan\'s IMF stand-by agreement and </p><p>endorse a (Jordanian) fiscal and monetary program for 2004." </p><p>Given that the IMF and Jordan are still in the process of </p><p>negotiating a 2003 program and that discussions of a 2004 </p><p>program would not even begin until late 2003 (with Board </p><p>approval sometime in 2004) and that the first review has not </p><p>yet been completed, this would have the effect of delaying </p><p>Jordan\'s use of the $200 million until well into calendar </p><p>year 2004.  The Ministers reiterated to Emboffs that they </p><p>need and are counting on receiving the total $700 million </p><p>before the end of 2003 to meet war related budgetary </p><p>shortfalls that will occur during calendar year 2003. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  As reported in ref c, the government believes it </p><p>will need to cover a war-related shortfall of at least $740 </p><p>million in order to meet its 2003 fiscal target agreed with </p><p>the IMF.  Therefore, in order to meet the 2003 target without </p><p>the full amount of U.S. assistance, they would have to cut </p><p>into spending on healthcare, education, and water development </p><p>contained in the 2003 budget.  This is exactly the outcome </p><p>that we were seeking to avoid by making extraordinary </p><p>war-related assistance available to Jordan.  Cutting social </p><p>spending programs would have a severe social impact that </p><p>would affect the broader economic and political stability of </p><p>the country.  This would undermine the positive economic, </p><p>political and social reforms that King Abdullah has been </p><p>personally associated with since he took the throne in 1999. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  At the same time, the government remains solidly </p><p>committed to the plan described to the United States last </p><p>November to raise consumer petroleum prices to world levels </p><p>(ref b and c) and meet other conditions, including to </p><p>continue economic reforms under IMF auspices.  Indeed, they </p><p>have already started the process of raising oil prices.  They </p><p>are also committed to not drawing on the final $200 million </p><p>until the IMF Board has renewed its endorsement of Jordan\'s </p><p>economic program and the cabinet has approved a three-year </p><p>plan to eliminate oil subsidies.  Furthermore, they are </p><p>committed to expending all sums through the national </p><p>budgetary process. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Before the IMF staff is even in a position to </p><p>recommend to its Board that it approve a 2003 fiscal and </p><p>monetary program, the IMF will want reassurances from the GOJ </p><p>that unanticipated shortfalls are covered so that the </p><p>originally budgeted deficit target of 4.3% of GDP is </p><p>attainable.  Without this, the IMF will not be in a position </p><p>to begin discussion of a 2004 program or approve completion </p><p>of IMF reviews under the stand-by arrangement, the first of </p><p>which has not yet taken place.  In essence, Jordan might </p><p>never be able to meet the conditions for using the final $200 </p><p>million suggested in the recent draft transfer agreement text. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Comment:  This issue must be satisfactorily solved </p><p>prior the Secretary of State\'s visit on May 12.  If not, the </p><p>King will most certainly raise it, introducing a negative </p><p>issue to the agenda and dampening the atmosphere of the </p><p>visit, as a whole.  We recommend that, as the Jordanians </p><p>suggest, the provision in the draft agreement apply to the </p><p>fiscal and monetary program for 2003 that the GOJ is </p><p>currently in the process of discussing with the IMF.  This </p><p>should be finalized and approved by the Executive Board by </p><p>mid-2003, allowing the GOJ access to the full amount it needs </p><p>to cover shortfalls and meet its targets this year and in the </p><p>future, as long as it completes the other three measures </p><p>listed in the transfer agreement. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
