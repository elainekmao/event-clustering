(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for reasons </p><p>1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>ABU DHABI CONCEDES LNG MARKET TO QATAR </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The managing director of the Abu Dhabi Gas </p><p>Liquification Company (ADGAS), Hassan Al-Marzooki, told </p><p>Econchief April 2 that his firm is considering a major </p><p>expansion into the Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) business. </p><p>ADGAS, which currently operates three Liquified Natural Gas </p><p>(LNG) trains at Abu Dhabi Emirate\'s Das Island, is finding </p><p>that competition from Qatar is squeezing margins in the LNG </p><p>business.  "The Qataris are desperate for investment and </p><p>production, so they are willing to take very cheap prices," </p><p>Al-Marzooki lamented.  Despite excellent working </p><p>relationships with its primary LNG customer -- the Tokyo </p><p>Electric Power Company (TEPCO, which is also a major equity </p><p>stakeholder in ADGAS) -- ADGAS still must renegotiate its </p><p>sales contract every six years.  ADGAS has about 18 months </p><p>to run on the existing contract, and is very concerned that </p><p>increased competition from Qatar (and to a lesser degree </p><p>from Iran) will result in sharply lower prices.  ADGAS has </p><p>paid off its sunk costs (the first LNG train was installed </p><p>in the 1970s), but LNG plants require extensive maintenance, </p><p>which is costly.  "We will still have a good business," Al- </p><p>Marzooki admitted, "but it is clear that LNG is no longer a </p><p>growth business for us." </p><p> </p><p>THE FUTURE LIES IN LPG </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The ADGAS official said his firm is currently </p><p>considering a major expansion into the LPG field.  ADGAS </p><p>currently produces about 1.5 million tons per year of LPG </p><p>derived from the associated gasses resulting from oil </p><p>production by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). </p><p>ADGAS shareholders are now contemplating investing several </p><p>hundred million USD into effectively doubling that output. </p><p>While no final decisions have yet been made, the venture </p><p>looks highly promising, Al-Marzooki noted, and the LPG </p><p>market is stable and attractive.  Expanding LPG production </p><p>would also dovetail nicely with ADNOC\'s ongoing projects to </p><p>increase sustainable oil production capacity, the ADGAS </p><p>official noted.  One of the current major constraints on </p><p>additional oil production is how to dispose of the extra </p><p>associated gas.  GASCO, Abu Dhabi Emirate\'s other gas </p><p>production company, has limited surge capacity -- which is </p><p>the primary constraint on extra oil production.  The UAE </p><p>does not want to flare gas, so currently must limit oil </p><p>production to that capacity of associated gas which can </p><p>either be re-injected or processed.  This oil production </p><p>bottleneck is partially being addressed through the </p><p>expansion of condensate processing by GASCO (via OGD-3, the </p><p>third phase of GASCO\'s Onshore Gas Development scheme), and </p><p>ADGAS would take its feed for the LPG plant directly from </p><p>GASCO, thereby helping extract maximum benefit from the </p><p>feedstock.  Residual dry gas (after removal of sulphur) </p><p>would mostly be re-injected. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ADGAS officials had told us a couple of years ago </p><p>that they were studying the LNG market in order to determine </p><p>whether it would be worthwhile to make the multi-billion USD </p><p>investment necessary to add a fourth LNG train at Das </p><p>island.  It appears that, having looked at the rapid </p><p>development (and razor-thin margins) of the Qatari LNG </p><p>sector, ADGAS has decided to let discretion be the better </p><p>part of valor.  Abu Dhabi\'s associated gas, quite simply, is </p><p>not as economically attractive to develop for LNG purposes </p><p>as Qatar\'s huge non-associated deposits.  LPG, which can be </p><p>used either as a fuel or a petrochemical feedstock, </p><p>represents a much more attractive (and less hotly contested) </p><p>market for Abu Dhabi.  Since Abu Dhabi\'s aging oil fields </p><p>are experiencing an increasing Gas-to-Oil Ratio (GOR), the </p><p>LPG processing facility -- when combined with GASCO\'s </p><p>ongoing OGD-3 project -- will help maintain current levels </p><p>of oil production in the out years, while more immediately </p><p>removing gas handling bottlenecks that impede any increase </p><p>in sustainable oil production capacity.  With a FEED (front- </p><p>end engineering and design) contract already awarded, we </p><p>would bet that the ADGAS shareholders will shortly give </p><p>final approval for this venture. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
