<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 002733 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/ARN AND NEA/IPA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR THEROUX </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/08/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PREL, PTER, ETTC, KPAL, SY, IS, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  SYRIA\'S BASHAR URGED TO WORK WITH THE </p><p>U.S. BY THE FORMER UAE OIL MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>REF:  DAMASCUS 2781 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY:  Former UAE Oil Minister and Zayid </p><p>confidant Mana\'a Saeed Al-Otaiba requested a </p><p>meeting with the Ambassador on June 7 to brief her </p><p>on the outcome of his late May one-on-one in </p><p>Damascus with Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad.  Al- </p><p>Otaiba, who served as the UAE Oil Minister from </p><p>1973-90, was personal friends with Hafez Al-Asad </p><p>and said he met with Bashar to express his deep </p><p>concerns about the course of the U.S.-Syrian </p><p>bilateral relationship and to urge the younger Al- </p><p>Asad to take some difficult but ultimately </p><p>necessary steps with regard to the Palestinian </p><p>hardline presence and Syria\'s ties with Hezballah </p><p>and Iran.  Al-Otaiba advised Bashar to reach out to </p><p>the U.S. and suggested that he open a channel to </p><p>the Israelis.  He also used the opportunity to </p><p>press for an economic and political opening in </p><p>Syria.  Al-Otaiba confided that he had undertaken </p><p>this mission voluntarily and without prior </p><p>consultation with the UAEG, but had briefed both </p><p>President Zayid and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Khalifa </p><p>bin Zayid following his Damascus visit.  Al-Otaiba </p><p>said the conversation with Bashar had been </p><p>extremely "frank;" his sense was the young Syrian </p><p>was "listening" but struggling to extricate himself </p><p>from the grip of some of his father\'s old advisors. </p><p>The fact that Al-Otaiba decided to personally </p><p>engage Bashar is indicative of just how worried a </p><p>number of current and former UAE officials are </p><p>about the future of Syria and the course of the </p><p>Syrian-U.S. relationship. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THE AL-ASADS AND SADDAM </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Former UAE Oil Minister Mana\'a Saeed Al- </p><p>Otaiba met one-on-one with Bashar Al-Asad sometime </p><p>in late May.  In a June 7 meeting at his well- </p><p>appointed home in Abu Dhabi, Al-Otaiba told the </p><p>Ambassador he was aware that UAE InfoMin Abdullah </p><p>bin Zayid had also met with Al-Asad to deliver </p><p>essentially the same message (reftel).  Bashar </p><p>asked Al-Otaiba if he was carrying a message from </p><p>the UAEG or the USG to which Al-Otaiba answered in </p><p>the negative, though Al-Otaiba did offer to the </p><p>Ambassador to serve as a channel to the SARG. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Al-Otaiba prefaced his remarks to the </p><p>Ambassador by noting that the Al-Asad family </p><p>absolutely loathed Saddam Hussein.  He was </p><p>confident that Bashar would never have provided </p><p>refuge to Saddam.  In fact, Al-Otaiba stated, </p><p>Bashar "would have been among the first to have </p><p>Saddam killed." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>FRIENDLY ADVICE:  REACH OUT TO U.S., CLOSE THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN HARDLINE OFFICES AND TONE DOWN TIES </p><p>WITH HEZBALLAH AND IRAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Al-Otaiba told the Ambassador that he had </p><p>decided to approach Bashar as a friend, drawing on </p><p>his decades-long personal relationship with Asad </p><p>pere.  Al-Otaiba told Bashar that he was deeply </p><p>worried about Syria and urged him to reach out to </p><p>the U.S.  "Put your hand in America\'s hand," Al- </p><p>Otaiba advised, noting that if Bashar\'s ultimate </p><p>goal was the return of the Golan, the path lay </p><p>through Washington.  Al-Otaiba also suggested that </p><p>Bashar open a channel to Israel.  He strongly </p><p>recommended that the SARG close the hardline </p><p>Palestinian offices, asking rhetorically what </p><p>benefit these organizations brought to Syria.  Al- </p><p>Otaiba told the Ambassador he was confident Bashar </p><p>would do the necessary on closing these offices. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Turning to Hezballah, Al-Otaiba noted that </p><p>with the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, </p><p>there was no reason to maintain ties with </p><p>Hezballah.  He also suggested that Bashar tone down </p><p>the relationship with Iran.  Bashar demurred that </p><p>Iran had helped the Al-Asad family through </p><p>difficult times (NFI).  Al-Otaiba rejoined that the </p><p>times have changed and "you should not back the </p><p>losing horse." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>NEED FOR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INFITAH </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Al-Otaiba advised Bashar to open up Syria </p><p>economically and politically.  "The era of one- </p><p>party rule is over," Al-Otaiba told his Syrian </p><p>host; he ruefully noted to the Ambassador that the </p><p>Arab world is the only place where the </p><p>"ishtirakeen" (socialists) continue to have a hold. </p><p>He urged Bashar to actively court foreign </p><p>investment and give concessions to Western oil </p><p>companies, both of which are necessary if Syria is </p><p>to modernize.  Al-Otaiba compared the development </p><p>of Dubai with that of Damascus, noting to Bashar </p><p>that when he landed at Damascus International, all </p><p>he saw on the tarmac were two old Syrian Airlines </p><p>passenger jets.  Dubai, by contrast, has become the </p><p>transit and destination point for hundreds of </p><p>airlines.  Bashar sought Al-Otaiba\'s help in </p><p>arranging training for Syrians in the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Al-Otaiba was once a powerful figure in UAE </p><p>politics.  He served as Oil Minister from 1973-90 </p><p>and was one of Zayid\'s closest advisors.  Since </p><p>relinquishing the oil portfolio, Al-Otaiba\'s </p><p>profile has diminished though he told the </p><p>Ambassador he still maintains ties to Zayid, Abu </p><p>Dhabi Crown Prince Khalifa bin Zayid and Armed </p><p>Forces Chief of Staff Muhammad bin Zayid (MBZ). </p><p>One of Al-Otaiba\'s sons, Yousef, is MbZ\'s personal </p><p>assistant.  The Al-Otaiba are one of Abu Dhabi\'s </p><p>oldest and most prestigious families and are </p><p>intermarried with the Al-Nahyan.  While Al-Otaiba </p><p>is enjoying his early retirement (he was only 44 </p><p>when he lost the oil portfolio), he clearly </p><p>relishes being in the limelight. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
