REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01123  261445Z </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) ON MARCH 23, HIGH COURT JUDGE VERNANDA ZIYAMBI </p><p>DISMISSED A PETITION BY THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) SEEKING NULLIFICATION OF ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY VICTORY LAST JUNE IN THE ZVISHAVANE </p><p>CONSTITUENCY.  ZIYAMBI\'S JUDGMENT WAS THE FIRST TO BE </p><p>HANDED DOWN BY THE HIGH COURT SINCE IT BEGAN HEARING LAST </p><p>MONTH LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE RESULTS IN 37 CONSTITUENCIES. </p><p>IN ISSUING HER JUDGMENT ORALLY (THE WRITTEN VERSION IS </p><p>LIKELY TO FOLLOW SOMETIME THIS WEEK), ZIYAMBI ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION HAD </p><p>OCCURRED IN ZVISHAVANE PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, AND ASSERTED </p><p>THAT BOTH SIDES HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE.  HOWEVER, SHE RULED </p><p>AGAINST THE PLAINTIFFS FOR THREE REASONS: THEY HAD FAILED </p><p>TO LINK THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE -- PEARSON MBALEKWA -- TO THE </p><p>VIOLENCE; THE VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION WERE SPORADIC AND </p><p>NOT "OF A GENERAL NATURE"; AND THE WITNESSES WERE </p><p>UNRELIABLE. </p><p> </p><p>MDC\'S REACTION </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN A MARCH 26 CONVERSATION WITH POLITICAL SECTION </p><p>CHIEF, MDC MP -- AND SHADOW MINISTER OF JUSTICE -- DAVID </p><p>COLTART CRITICIZED THE HIGH COURT DECISION.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>COLTART, THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN ZIYAMBI\'S DECISION HAD BEEN </p><p>THAT THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE COULD NOT BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO </p><p>THE VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION PRECEDING THE ELECTION IN </p><p>ZVINAVASHE.  THAT FINDING, COLTART INSISTED, REVEALED A </p><p>MISINTERPRETATION OF THE ELECTORAL ACT, WHICH REQUIRED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01123  261445Z </p><p>PROOF OF SUCH A LINKAGE ONLY IF THE PLAINTIFF WAS SEEKING </p><p>THE BANNING OF THE INDIVIDUAL FROM ELECTORAL POLITICS.  IN </p><p>THIS PARTICULAR CASE, HOWEVER, THE MDC HAD SOUGHT ONLY TO </p><p>HAVE THE ELECTION RESULT OVERTURNED.  COLTART ALSO SCOFFED </p><p>AT ZIYAMBI\'S CONTENTION THAT INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE HAD BEEN </p><p>SPORADIC, NOT GENERAL, EMPHASIZING THAT THE ATMOSPHERE IN </p><p>ZVISHAVANE WAS "SO BAD THAT IT SUBVERTED THE ENTIRE </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS."  COLTART SAID THE MDC WOULD APPEAL TO </p><p>THE SUPREME COURT.  THE MDC MP EXPRESSED A BROADER CONCERN </p><p>THAT NONE OF THE THREE JUDGES HEARING THE ELECTORAL </p><p>CHALLENGES -- ZIYAMBI, PADDINGTON GARWE, AND JAMES DEVITTIE </p><p>-- APPEARED INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE </p><p>PRESENTED IN THE SEVEN CASES HEARD SO FAR.  IN ONE </p><p>INSTANCE, JUDGE DEVITTIE HAD REFUSED EVEN TO CONSIDER </p><p>DETAILED ASSESSMENTS OF THE ELECTION BY EU AND COMMONWEALTH </p><p>OBSERVERS, COMPLAINING IN OPEN COURT THAT HE DID NOT HAVE </p><p>THE TIME TO READ SUCH LENGTHY DOCUMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE MDC IS CLEARLY DISAPPOINTED WITH JUDGE </p><p>ZIYAMBI\'S DECISION, BUT, FRANKLY, WE WERE NOT SURPRISED AT </p><p>THE RULING.  WITNESSES CAN MAKE OR BREAK A CASE, AND THE </p><p>WITNESSES IN THE ZVISHAVANE SUIT WERE NOT PARTICULARLY </p><p>CREDIBLE, WERE CLEARLY COACHED ON HOW TO RESPOND TO CERTAIN </p><p>QUESTIONS, AND WERE OFTEN SURLY AND DISRESPECTFUL TOWARD </p><p>THE JUDGE.  DAVID COLTART\'S COMPLAINT NOTWITHSTANDING, </p><p>REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE IN THEIR INTERPRETATIONS OF </p><p>THE FUZZILY-WRITTEN ELECTORAL ACT.  ALTHOUGH ZIYAMBI IS </p><p>GENERALLY VIEWED AS SYMPATHETIC TO ZANU-PF, HER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01123  261445Z </p><p>INTERPRETATION IN THIS CASE APPEARS TO OUR LAYMAN\'S EYES AT </p><p>LEAST TO BE LEGALLY DEFENSIBLE.  THE ZVISHAVANE JUDGMENT </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT ZIYAMBI\'S PREDOMINANT CONSIDERATIONS IN THE </p><p>REMAINING CASES WILL BE WHETHER THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE CAN </p><p>BE LINKED TO INCIDENTS OF FRAUD, VIOLENCE, OR INTIMIDATION </p><p>AND WHETHER SUCH ABUSES AFFECTED SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF </p><p>THE POPULATION.  JUDGING FROM THEIR QUESTIONS IN THE CASES </p><p>BEFORE THEM, JUDGES GARWE AND DEVITTIE ARE LIKELY TO TAKE </p><p>THE SAME APPROACH.  ADDITIONAL JUDGMENTS COULD BE </p><p>FORTHCOMING SOON, AS SIX OTHER CASES HAVE NOW BEEN </p><p>COMPLETED. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
