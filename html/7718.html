<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002528 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MOPS, PHUM, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ WAR HITS POPULAR CREDIBILITY OF KING </p><p>ABDULLAH, U.S.; MANY LOOK FOR PROGRESS ON THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  The perceived support that King Abdullah gave to the </p><p>military campaign in Iraq -- which many Jordanians contrast </p><p>with his statements that U.S. forces in Jordan performed </p><p>merely a defensive role -- has led to a good bit of </p><p>anti-government grumbling and, during the war, some open </p><p>criticism of the King at anti-war protests.  Jordanian </p><p>popular mistrust of U.S. motives -- already significantly </p><p>heightened over more than two years of the Intifada -- has </p><p>soared in the wake of the war, with Jordanians expressing </p><p>resentment and distrust of the U.S.  While time and a rebound </p><p>in economic growth may convince some Jordanians of the wisdom </p><p>of King Abdullah\'s decision to support the Coalition, </p><p>concrete movement on the peace process would much more </p><p>quickly vindicate the King\'s decision, and help regain some </p><p>U.S. credibility as well.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>KING\'S REPUTATION TAKES SOME HITS DOMESTICALLY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Several GOJ officials have expressed to us recently </p><p>worry over the effect of the Iraq war on King Abdullah\'s </p><p>domestic standing in Jordan.  During the war, there were </p><p>several demonstrations in the southern cities of Ma\'an, </p><p>Kerak, and Tafileh in which demonstrators carried signs and </p><p>chanted slogans critical of the King and his perceived </p><p>support for American military efforts against Iraq.  Several </p><p>anti-regime pamphlets appeared in those and other cities as </p><p>well, prompting GOJ security forces to tighten their control </p><p>over demonstrations and watch opposition groups more </p><p>carefully.  At the same time, there appears to have been a </p><p>sharp drop in economic activity in the first quarter of 2003 </p><p>as businesses and individuals put off investment and </p><p>consumption decisions in the lead-up to war. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Labor Minister Mozaheim Mohefen told Embassy FSN </p><p>last week that, indeed, several protests in Karak and Tafileh </p><p>during the war had contained "direct attacks" on King </p><p>Abdullah, something that had traditionally been completely </p><p>out of bounds.  In response, Mohefen -- who has tribal </p><p>origins in the south -- said he had been dispatched to the </p><p>region to look into and deal with the anti-King sentiment. </p><p>Mohefen said the GOJ had offered paper "jobs" to hundreds in </p><p>the two governorates in an effort to defuse a worrisome </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Several contacts outside the government have also </p><p>reported to us that most average Jordanians believe that </p><p>Jordan provided significant military support to the Coalition </p><p>war in Iraq.  Since GOJ public acknowledgment of U.S. troop </p><p>deployment was limited to Patriot air defense batteries, many </p><p>Jordanians have let their imaginations run wild and believe </p><p>the King permitted the launching of a "secret invasion" of </p><p>Iraq from Jordanian territory.  Sketchy local press reports </p><p>of sightings of khaki-clad foreigners and strange aircraft in </p><p>the eastern desert have fueled this speculation -- and a good </p><p>deal of hyperbole.  According to several contacts, many </p><p>Jordanians have contrasted this popular perception of </p><p>Jordanian support to the military effort with statements by </p><p>King Abdullah and other senior GOJ officials that Jordan did </p><p>not support the war or permit combat operations to be </p><p>conducted from Jordanian territory.  The gap between the </p><p>King\'s statements and the perceived reality, they argue, has </p><p>damaged the King\'s credibility. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  Similarly, we have heard reports that there was a </p><p>certain amount of grumbling in the Jordan Armed Forces (JAF) </p><p>about Jordanian government support for U.S. military efforts </p><p>in Iraq.  Military contacts tell us that senior JAF officers </p><p>held meetings with middle and low-ranking officers and troops </p><p>in an effort to explain Jordan\'s national interest in </p><p>supporting the U.S.  Sources in the Jordanian JCS indicate </p><p>that a few soldiers who opposed the war were detained.  In </p><p>the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), there was concern </p><p>that Jordan\'s public association with the U.S. campaign would </p><p>create problems GID would have to deal with -- both </p><p>internally and from the Iraqi Intelligence Service. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>AS DOES THE U.S. </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  U.S. credibility -- already low following two and a </p><p>half years of the intifada -- has also taken a big hit. </p><p>Jordanian popular concerns about the U.S. in the aftermath of </p><p>the Iraq war are numerous: many worry that Syria will be the </p><p>next country to come under U.S. attack. Others criticize ORHA </p><p>Chief Jay Garner as a "Zionist" who will try to lead a new </p><p>Iraqi government into pro-Israel policies.  Nearly all see </p><p>INC leader Ahmed Chalabi -- convicted of bank fraud in Jordan </p><p>-- as a sinister tool of U.S. policy.  Finally, most </p><p>Jordanians believe -- fed by a long series of press stories </p><p>making this assumption -- that the U.S. invaded Iraq merely </p><p>to gain control over Iraq\'s oil resources and plans for a </p><p>long-term occupation much like the Israeli presence in the </p><p>West Bank and Gaza.  The Jordanian press refers to both </p><p>Israeli and U.S. forces as "occupation forces."  The number </p><p>of Jordanians who draw parallels between the U.S. presence in </p><p>Iraq and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank/Gaza is </p><p>strikingly high, and the U.S. presence in Iraq is already </p><p>referred to popularly as an "occupation." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  The damage to the King\'s standing is real, but is </p><p>something from which he can recover given the right </p><p>conditions.  The benefits of the King\'s decision will be more </p><p>evident if there is concrete progress on the Roadmap.  The </p><p>economic pressures and uncertainties may now also begin to </p><p>ease, thanks to U.S. financial assistance and optimism about </p><p>Jordan\'s economic future in a Saddam-free region. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S)  For the U.S., the political cost is in lost </p><p>goodwill.  Average Jordanians now ascribe to the U.S. the </p><p>worst possible motive for any action.  This very negative </p><p>post-war popular impression of U.S. goals may begin to fade </p><p>if things move quickly and well in Iraq.  Even more </p><p>important, however, will be U.S. moves to support the Roadmap </p><p>and secure real progress toward the formation of a </p><p>Palestinian state. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
