<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001789 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR ECOSOC DELEGATION </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, BM, NL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH ON BURMA: EU WAITING UNTIL AUTUMN </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 200487 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/PolCouns Nathaniel Dean Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) PolOff made reftel points to Roeland Kollen, Policy </p><p>Officer in the MFA\'s South-East Asia Division, on July 11. </p><p>Kollen said the EU will consider additional bilateral </p><p>measures against Burma this fall; at present, the EU is </p><p>deliberating on what other measures, if any, might be useful </p><p>in promoting democratic change.  Kollen said that the idea of </p><p>an import ban has been brought up in informal conversations, </p><p>but is not currently under serious consideration.  He was </p><p>unsure whether or not this idea would face great obstacles </p><p>within the EU.  The GoNL discourages Dutch companies from </p><p>investing in Burma, but does not traditionally support </p><p>import/export or investment bans.  Kollen could not say </p><p>whether or not the GoNL would approve such a ban in this </p><p>situation.  Note:  At present, there is very little Dutch </p><p>investment in Burma.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Dutch Foreign Minister Jaap de Hoop Scheffer plans to </p><p>travel to Bali, Indonesia July 23-24 for the Asia-Europe </p><p>(ASEM) Foreign Minister\'s meeting.  The Dutch hope to have a </p><p>bilateral with the Chinese on the margins, and Kollen stated </p><p>that Burma will be on the list of topics.  Kollen also said </p><p>that the EU is reviewing options regarding Burma and the </p><p>CHR/ECOSOC resolution. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Dutch are discussing UN Special Envoy Razali\'s </p><p>current mission and mandate, and will closely watch his </p><p>presentation to the ICG on July 15.  Kollen opined whether a </p><p>permanent mission in Burma, staffed by the right individual, </p><p>might be a alternate plausible option.  He also added that </p><p>the Dutch "do not blame Razali" for the worsening situation </p><p>in country. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
