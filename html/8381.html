(C) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST:  The Honduran Congress </p><p>approved on the evening of May 28 both the resolution </p><p>authorizing the deployment of Honduran troops to Iraq and the </p><p>ICC Article 98 Agreement with the U.S.  Ambassador Palmer met </p><p>with the President of Congress,  Porfirio Lobo Sosa, on May </p><p>22 to personally urge the Congress to act expeditiously and </p><p>favorably on these two important U.S. foreign policy </p><p>initiatives.  As the final slim majority outcomes </p><p>demonstrated, both measures were seen as controversial in </p><p>Honduras and cost the Maduro administration political </p><p>capital.  The deployment will cost the Government of Honduras </p><p>(GOH) about USD 400,000 in unbudgeted military deployment </p><p>costs, which represents a significant financial burden for </p><p>the GOH as it continues difficult negotiations to reach a new </p><p>IMF agreement.  Given these favorable policy actions by </p><p>Honduras, Post requests that Washington policymakers give all </p><p>possible consideration to reprogramming FMF funds to Honduras </p><p>as a tangible sign of our appreciation for both their </p><p>steadfast political support and, now, their concrete </p><p>contribution to the Coalition of the Willing.  See action </p><p>request in paragraph 8.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Honduran Congress approved on the evening of May </p><p>28 both the resolution authorizing the deployment of Honduran </p><p>troops to Iraq and the ICC Article 98 Agreement with the U.S. </p><p> The margin for both resolutions was small, as President </p><p>Ricardo Maduro\'s National Party and its small coalition </p><p>partner, the Christian Democrats, narrowly defeated </p><p>opposition from the Liberal Party, as well as the minor PINU </p><p>and UD parties.  Liberal Party Congressman Ramon Villeda </p><p>Bermudez criticized the resolution as "the Government of </p><p>Honduras legitimizing the illegal war that the U.S. declared </p><p>against Saddam Hussein\'s regime."  Other opposition centered </p><p>on the cost of the deployment and the lack of consultation by </p><p>President Maduro with the Congress over his management of </p><p>Honduran foreign policy. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Iraq resolution authorizes sending 370 soldiers to </p><p>Iraq for a one-year deployment, with rotations of soldiers by </p><p>"semester."  Each soldier will receive USD 150/month, with </p><p>USD 5,000 allotted for administrative expenses.  The total </p><p>estimated cost is 6.5 million lempiras (USD 382,353).  A key </p><p>additional expense is life insurance policies for the </p><p>deployed soldiers.  None of these costs were anticipated in </p><p>this year\'s defense budget.  Given the stalled negotiations </p><p>with the IMF on a new poverty reduction and growth facility, </p><p>these additional expenses could not come at a more difficult </p><p>budgetary moment for the GOH. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador Palmer met with Pepe Lobo, the President of </p><p>Congress, on May 22 to specifically relay our interest in </p><p>seeing the Article 98 agreement and the Honduran troop </p><p>deployment to Iraq approved.  Lobo understood immediately the </p><p>importance of rapid action by the Congress in its last week </p><p>in session before a one month recess.  Even though the Maduro </p><p>Administration had not yet delivered either piece of </p><p>legislation to Congress and had only consulted informally </p><p>with Lobo the previous week, Lobo was very optimistic about </p><p>the two measures being approved before the May 29 recess. </p><p>The Ambassador suggested the wisdom of packaging the two </p><p>measures together in order to limit the political opposition </p><p>to a single foreign policy debate.  Lobo closed the meeting </p><p>in the great tradition of a previous President from Texas, </p><p>who once served as Senate Majority Leader, by telling the </p><p>Ambassador that if the Executive Branch would get him the </p><p>treaty, he\'d get it through the Congress.   True to his word, </p><p>Lobo delivered. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Separately, the DCM earlier last week, re-delivered </p><p>long-standing demarche points to the Acting Foreign Minister </p><p>laying out the need for immediate Honduran ratification of </p><p>the Article 98 agreement and congressional authorization for </p><p>the troop deployment.  He pressed the Acting Foreign Minister </p><p>for immediate action on the Article 98 agreement and flagged </p><p>the need for expeditious action on the authorization for </p><p>deploying Honduran troops to Iraq given the impending </p><p>congressional recess.  The MFA responded in a timely manner </p><p>and provided important information to the Congress during the </p><p>late night debate.  In addition, other country team members </p><p>effectively lobbied the Ministry of Defense and congressional </p><p>party leaders to actively support passage of the measures. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The vote on the ICC Article 98 Agreement was 65 in </p><p>favor - 61 Nationals and four Christian Democrats, and 62 </p><p>opposed - 55 Liberals, four UD, and three PINU.  The </p><p>opposition denounced the agreement and claimed that approval </p><p>required either a two-thirds or three-quarters of the </p><p>Congress, and not just a majority of the votes.  In their </p><p>comments, opposition congressmen both criticized the U.S. and </p><p>showed a lack of understanding of the fact that Article 98 </p><p>Agreements are explicitly allowed by the Treaty of Rome that </p><p>established the ICC.  In response to opposition complaints, </p><p>National Congressman Carlos Espinoza said, "If it is a sin to </p><p>support a government like the United States, then one must </p><p>sin." </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Both resolutions will now be published in La Gaceta, </p><p>the Honduran version of the Federal Register, to become </p><p>official.  For the ICC Article 98 Agreement, Post\'s </p><p>understanding is that the USG and GOH must then exchange </p><p>instruments of ratification for the agreement to take effect. </p><p> The Liberal Party is threatening to take a constitutional </p><p>challenge to the Supreme Court over the simple majority vote </p><p>for the ratification of the Article 98 agreement.  A leading </p><p>Honduran politician, Oswaldo Ramos Soto, stated that such a </p><p>challenge would fail because the agreement is a protocol to a </p><p>treaty that has already been approved by the Congress, thus </p><p>obviating the need for a super-majority approval. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Action Request: As noted the approved troop deployment </p><p>will cost the GOH about USD 400,000 in unbudgeted costs. </p><p>This budget hit represents a real financial challenge for the </p><p>GOH as it proceeds with difficult negotiations to reach a new </p><p>IMF agreement.  Given the very postive outcome on these two </p><p>high-profile U.S. foreign policy initiatives, Post requests </p><p>that Washington policymakers give all possible consideration </p><p>to reprogramming FMF funds to Honduras as a tangible sign of </p><p>our appreciation for both their steadfast political support </p><p>and, now, their concrete contribution to the Coalition of the </p><p>Willing. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment: Facing the May 29 adjournment of Congress for </p><p>a one month recess, the GOH had to obtain Congressional </p><p>passage of the Iraq resolution now if it was going to be able </p><p>to assist in post-conflict Iraq.  The GOH had been delaying </p><p>sending the ICC Article 98 Agreement to Congress ever since </p><p>it became the first country in Central America (and the </p><p>second in Latin America) to sign such an agreement on </p><p>September 19, 2002.  Post had been urging the GOH for months </p><p>to act to avoid possible cutoff of U.S. military assistance </p><p>under the American Service Members Protection Act (ASPA) on </p><p>July 1, and is pleased to see congressional approval of the </p><p>agreement.  In the end, the much maligned Nationalist </p><p>congressional delegation, under the strong leadership of its </p><p>President of Congress, delivered a crucial foreign policy </p><p>victory for the Maduro government.  In doing so, the </p><p>Nationalist deputies showed that they understand the vital </p><p>nature of the U.S.-Honduras bilateral relationship, a fact </p><p>that the opposition parties failed to acknowledge in their </p><p>knee-jerk opposition to these measures.  End Comment. </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
