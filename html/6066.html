SUMMARY:  THE AFTERMATH OF THE ARAB SUMMIT AND THE UAE </p><p>INITIATIVE ON IRAQ CONTINUED TO GENERATE EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN </p><p>THE LOCAL MEDIA.  NEWS REPORTING AND EDITORIALS PRAISED SHEIKH </p><p>ZAYED\'S PLAN AND CRITICIZED ARAB LEADERS\' ATTITUDES TOWARDS IT. </p><p>AN "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL APPLAUDED THE UAE INITIATIVE AND </p><p>DECLARED IT AS \'THE WISEST SOLUTION\' FOR THE CURRENT CRISIS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  NOTING THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN ARAB LEADERS DURING THE SUMMIT, </p><p>SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/03: </p><p> </p><p>"... BEFORE COMPLAINING ABOUT OTHERS, ARAB COUNTRIES SHOULD </p><p>RESOLVE ALL CONFLICTS BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND COVER UP ALL THE </p><p>HOLES THAT ARE GROWING DEEPER AND WIDER.  THE (AMERICAN) POLICY </p><p>OF DIVIDING THE ARABS WILL NOT WORK IF IT HAD NO GROUNDS, WHICH </p><p>IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE ARAB REGION..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON THE UAE INITIATIVE PRESENTED TO THE ARAB </p><p>SUMMIT, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL-ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 3/03: </p><p> </p><p>"... ANY THOROUGH AND OBJECTIVE READING OF THE UAE\'S INITIATIVE </p><p>WILL TREAT IT FAIRLY AND SHUT UP WHOEVER THINKS THAT THE UAE IS </p><p>INTERFERING IN IRAQ\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS ... THIS INITIATIVE PLACED </p><p>BEFORE EVERYONE, WITH NO EXCEPTIONS, THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP.  IT ALSO PROVIDES AN ARAB AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SHIELD FOR A PEACEFUL BREAKTHROUGH THAT WILL SAVE </p><p>THE SOULS OF MANY WHO ARE ON THE VERGE OF DESTRUCTION..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  DESCRIBING ARAB ATTITUDES TOWARD THE UAE INITIATIVE PRESENTED </p><p>TO THE ARAB SUMMIT, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL </p><p>ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/03: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT IS STRANGE IS THAT THE VIEWS PRESENTED IN THE UAE </p><p>INITIATIVE REGARDING THE EXILE OF THE IRAQI REGIME AS THE FASTEST </p><p>AND SHORTEST WAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS WERE NOT RECEIVED WITH THE </p><p>ATTENTION THEY DESERVED ... THE ARABS HAVE LOST THEIR CHANCE TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT THIS CHOICE, WHICH FOCUSES ON SOLVING THIS CRISIS WITH </p><p>ARAB HANDS UNDER AN INTERNATIONAL UMBRELLA.  THIS WILL CUT THE </p><p>MEANS FOR THE U.S. AND OTHERS FROM PLOTTING THE WORST SCENARIOS </p><p>EVER AGAINST IRAQ AND THE REGION.  WHAT WE ARE AFRAID OF IS THAT </p><p>SUCH SCENARIOS TURN INTO FACTS IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS, AND THEN NO </p><p>\'IF\' WILL HELP." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
