<p>UNCLAS ROME 000966 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MASS, EU, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN DEFMIN\'S COMMENTS SPARK ANOTHER ROUND OF </p><p>"EURO-SKEPTICISM" CHARGES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  ITALIAN DEFENSE MINISTER ANTONIO MARTINO REVIVED </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY ACCUSATIONS THAT HE IS A "EURO-SKEPTIC" BY </p><p>SUGGESTING THAT THE EU HAD RUSHED INTO CREATING ITS OWN </p><p>MILITARY IDENTITY WITHOUT THINKING IT THROUGH.  THE NUMBER OF </p><p>TASKS APPROPRIATE FOR THE EU\'S RAPID REACTION FORCE (RRF) </p><p>SHOULD BE REDUCED TO "VERY FEW," MARTINO TOLD THE BRITISH </p><p>"DAILY TELEGRAPH" IN A FEBRUARY 21 INTERVIEW.  NATO HAS </p><p>PROVEN TO BE THE BEST VEHICLE TO PERFORM MULTINATIONAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00966  261857Z </p><p>OPERATIONS OF BOTH AN OFFENSIVE AND PEACE-KEEPING NATURE, </p><p>MARTINO SAID.  IT HAS A COMMAND AND CONTROL STRUCTURE THAT </p><p>WORKS -- SOMETHING THE RRF LACKS AT THIS POINT.  "NATO </p><p>WORKS," MARTINO STATED, ADDING, "IF IT AIN\'T BROKE, DON\'T FIX </p><p>IT." </p><p> </p><p>2. MARTINO ASKED THE SPANISH EU PRESIDENCY TO CALL A MEETING </p><p>OF EU DEFENSE MINISTERS TO RE-EXAMINE THE SCOPE OF THE </p><p>PETERSBURG TASKS AND DECIDE WHICH ONES ARE FEASIBLE FOR THE </p><p>RRF, ACCORDING TO THE INTERVIEW AND OTHER PRESS REPORTS. </p><p>MARTINO PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE MANY MISSIONS THE </p><p>RRF COULD CARRY OUT WITHOUT THERE BEING SOME DISAGREEMENT </p><p>AMONG THE EU MEMBERS.  HE CAUTIONED AGAINST CREATING </p><p>"DIVISIVE SITUATIONS" AMONG MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>3. ITALY\'S CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION QUICKLY JUMPED ON MARTINO\'S </p><p>STATEMENTS AS ANOTHER SIGN OF HIS -- AND THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>ADMINISTRATION\'S -- EURO-SKEPTICISM.  COMING NOT LONG AFTER </p><p>HIS PUBLIC DOUBTS ABOUT THE WISDOM OF A SINGLE EUROPEAN </p><p>CURRENCY AND HIS VOCAL REFUSAL TO SUPPORT ITALY\'S </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE AIRBUS A400M MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE, </p><p>MARTINO\'S COMMENTS ADD MORE FUEL TO THE FIRE.  GIOVANNI </p><p>FORCIERI, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE DEFENSE COMMITTEE AND </p><p>OPPOSITION MEMBER, SAID MARTINO\'S STATEMENTS WERE "SERIOUS" </p><p>AND NOT USEFUL TO THE US OR NATO.  GIUSEPPE MOLINARI, </p><p>OPPOSITION LEADER ON THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES\' DEFENSE </p><p>COMMITTEE, CHARGED THAT ITALY IS BECOMING "FLATTENED OUT ON </p><p>DEVOTIONAL ATLANTICSM," AND CALLED FOR MARTINO TO APPEAR </p><p>BEFORE PARLIAMENT.  CENTER-LEFT PARTY LEADER PIERO FASSINO </p><p>NOTED THAT BERLUSCONI CLAIMED TO BE DEFENDING ITALY\'S </p><p>NATIONAL INTERESTS, WHICH FASSINO SAID USED TO MEAN BEING A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00966  261857Z </p><p>PART OF EUROPE.  OPPOSITION MEMBERS ALSO OBJECTED TO </p><p>MARTINO\'S REQUEST FOR AN EU DEFMIN MEETING WITHOUT FIRST </p><p>HAVING CONSULTED WITH PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. COMMENT. MARTINO\'S COMMENTS ON THE RRF ARE FURTHER </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT HE IS LESS DOGMATIC ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE </p><p>"PRO-EU" THAN MANY ITALIANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE </p><p>OPPOSITION.  HE IS AN ADVOCATE FOR EUROPEAN MILITARIES WITH </p><p>RESTRUCTURED ARMED FORCES AND BETTER ARMAMENTS TO MEET GLOBAL </p><p>SECURITY NEEDS, AND ARGUES THAT IF EUROPEANS HAD ALLOTTED </p><p>MORE FUNDS FOR DEFENSE OVER THE YEARS, EUROPE WOULD HAVE </p><p>GREATER INFLUENCE IN WASHINGTON.  HE IS NOT THE ONLY MINISTER </p><p>WILLING TO TAKE A PRACTICAL, AND OFTEN CONTROVERSIAL, LOOK AT </p><p>EU INSTITUTIONS, BUT HIS RRF COMMENTS MAY BE A LITTLE OUT IN </p><p>FRONT OF HIS PRIME MINISTER\'S POSITION.  IN A RECENT </p><p>INTERVIEW IN "THE SUNDAY TIMES," BERLUSCONI SAID THAT THE RRF </p><p>SHOULD WORK IN COOPERATION WITH NATO BUT BE COMPLETELY </p><p>AUTONOMOUS.  MARTINO MAY HEAR MORE ON THE SUBJECT FROM HIS EU </p><p>COUNTERPARTS AT THE INFORMAL DEFENSE MINISTERS\' MEETING </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 22-23 IN SARAGOSA.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00966 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
