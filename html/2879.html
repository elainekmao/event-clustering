<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001091 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INT/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  INDEPENDENT DAILY NEWS CRITICIZES DESPOTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Rastiraka: Another old man </p><p>   resisting change" the independent daily "The Daily </p><p>   News" dedicated its May 2 editorial to criticizing </p><p>   despotic African leaders, especially Didier Rastiraka </p><p>   of Madagascar and Zimbabwe\'s Robert Mugabe.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Didier Rastiraka if Madagascar is a typical </p><p>   caricature of an African leader: he refuses to accept </p><p>   change and seem to believe that without him at the helm </p><p>   Madagascar would sink without trace into the Indian </p><p>   Ocean. . .  He and other leaders cling to the </p><p>   outrageous notion that African democracy is not </p><p>   necessarily compatible with the Western variety.  They </p><p>   seem to suggest African democracy must include a strong </p><p>   dash of totalitarianism to function effectively. . . </p><p>   Africa is the poorest continent primarily because the </p><p>   freedom in which spectacular economic development and </p><p>   unfettered political activity can thrive does not exist </p><p>   in many African countries.  The rulers, most of them </p><p>   old men of the ilk of Madagascar\'s Didier Rastiraka and </p><p>   our own Mugabe, believe their destiny is to rule their </p><p>   countries until they drop dead." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
