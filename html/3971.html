<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002265 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PUBLIC OPINION POLL REVEALS SUPRISING PERCEPTIONS </p><p>OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 00482 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p>1.  A USAID-funded Post-Presidential Election Survey revealed </p><p>some surprising results about the presidential election and </p><p>the political environment.  According to the poll, more than </p><p>72 percent of those surveyed said they voted, more than </p><p>official numbers.  Almost 40 percent of those surveyed would </p><p>not reveal for whom they voted but for those who did disclose </p><p>their votes more than 30 percent voted for opposition </p><p>candidate Morgan Tsvangirai and less than 30 percent voted </p><p>for President Robert Mugabe.  Surprisingly, nearly 60 percent </p><p>of those surveyed were opposed to mass action; the perception </p><p>of electoral fairness was evenly divided; and more than 60 </p><p>percent felt the post-election period was calm and </p><p>non-violent.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>POST-ELECTION SURVEY RESULTS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>2.  In mid-September, the Mass Public Opinion Institute </p><p>(MPOI)--Zimbabwe\'s only indigenous polling </p><p>organization--released the results of a July public opinion </p><p>survey, four months after the presidential election.  The </p><p>polling sample consisted of 1768 randomly selected people </p><p>(50.7 percent rural and 49.3 percent urban) from all of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s provinces.  Survey results revealed some </p><p>surprising attitudes about Movement for Democratic Change </p><p>(MDC) mass action, the fairness of the election, the desire </p><p>for a government of national unity, and perceptions about the </p><p>level of violence after the election.  The survey was a </p><p>follow-up to a poll conducted in February, prior to the </p><p>presidential election, and used the same enumeration areas </p><p>(with the addition of Mashonaland Central). </p><p> </p><p>VOTER TURNOUT </p><p>------------- </p><p>3.  More than 72 percent of the respondents said they </p><p>voted--more than the official percentage of some 55 </p><p>percent--with a higher turnout in rural areas than in urban </p><p>ones (76 percent versus 68 percent).  (COMMENT: This gap </p><p>could be attributed to a reluctance by some to admit that </p><p>they did not vote.  END COMMENT.) In the pre-election survey </p><p>86.7 percent of respondents indicated that they intended to </p><p>vote.  Of those who did not vote, the reasons were split </p><p>between not being registered (30 percent), not being in the </p><p>home constituency on polling day (22 percent) and other </p><p>reasons (21 percent).  In Harare, the primary reason for not </p><p>voting were the long lines (27 percent of respondents).  More </p><p>than half the Harare respondents waited in line for more than </p><p>six hours and one-third waited in line for more than nine. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION RESULTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p>4.  Forty percent of respondents refused to disclose for whom </p><p>they voted compared to 60 percent who refused to disclose </p><p>their preferences in the pre-election poll. Overall, 30.5 </p><p>percent of respondents said they voted for MDC candidate </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai while 27.4 percent said they voted for </p><p>President Robert Mugabe.  In contrast, the Zimbabwe Election </p><p>Support Network, a coalition of thirty-eight non-governmental </p><p>organizations formed to coordinate activities pertaining to </p><p>elections, reported 43.1 percent voting for MDC and 56.9 </p><p>percent for ZANU-PF.   Predictably, more rural dwellers said </p><p>they voted for Mugabe than urban dwellers (35 versus 18 </p><p>percent) and 39.7 percent of urban residents voted for </p><p>Tsvangirai.  Masipula Sithole, director of the MPOI, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>estimated that 88 percent of those who would not reveal their </p><p>votes, voted for Tsvangirai. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The following are survey results on voting from MPOI and </p><p>ZESN: </p><p> </p><p>MPOI:Mugabe/Tsvangirai/Secret     ZESN:Mugabe/Tsvangirai </p><p> </p><p>Harare: MPOI:16.6/46.1/35.4  ZESN:25/75 </p><p>Bulawayo: MPOI:12.5/35.7/49.1 ZESN:18/82 </p><p>Mash East: MPOI:32.3/20/46.2 ZESN:78/22 </p><p>Mash West: MPOI:55.3/12.6/32        ZESN:72/27 </p><p>Mash Central: MPOI:38.8/8.8/52.5  ZESN:84/16 </p><p>Midlands: MPOI:37.7/18.8/42 ZESN:63/37 </p><p>Mat North: MPOI:11.3/32.5/56.3 ZESN:64/36 </p><p>Mat South: MPOI:8.6/38.6/50 ZESN:53/46 </p><p>Manicaland: MPOI:12.3/46.1/35.4     ZESN:50/50 </p><p>Masvingo: MPOI:54.8/14.1/31.1 ZESN:70/30 </p><p>Total: MPOI:27.4/30.5/40.5  ZESN:56.9/43.1 </p><p> </p><p>OTHER FINDINGS </p><p>-------------- </p><p>6.  Surprises in the survey results include: </p><p> </p><p>--The majority of respondents--56.9 percent--were against </p><p>mass action, evenly divided among rural and urban areas.  In </p><p>Harare, slightly more than half of the respondents were </p><p>opposed to mass action and in Bulawayo close to 62 percent </p><p>were opposed. (COMMENT: These results suggest widespread </p><p>concern that mass action would trigger violence and not </p><p>provide an outcome that justifies the risks involved in </p><p>participating in such an action.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>--Slightly more people are in favor of a rerun of the </p><p>presidential election (44.9 versus 40 percent).  Manicaland, </p><p>Harare and Matebeleland North are the three areas most in </p><p>favor of a re-run.  Surprisingly, Bulawayo respondents were </p><p>not in favor of rerun (48.6 versus 44.5 percent).  (COMMENT: </p><p>It is interesting to note that people want a rerun but are </p><p>not willing to engage in mass action, an important tool for </p><p>forcing a rerun. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>--People were evenly divided over the fairness of the </p><p>election with 40.4 percent thinking it very free and fair and </p><p>41.4 percent not at all.  (COMMENT: This result is a </p><p>significant surprise, as we would have expected a widespread </p><p>perception of the election as averwhelmingly fraudulent.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) Predictably, urban residents thought the election </p><p>less free and fair than the rural residents (50.6 percent </p><p>versus 32.5 percent). </p><p> </p><p>--A smaller percentage of people favored a government of </p><p>national unity after the presidential election than before </p><p>(48.5 percent versus more than 60 percent in the pre-election </p><p>survey).  Thirty-five percent of respondents were opposed to </p><p>a government of national unity.  A higher percentage of rural </p><p>dwellers were in favor of a government of national unity than </p><p>urban dwellers (50.2 versus 46.7) but only 29.8 percent of </p><p>rural people were opposed, compared to 40.4 percent among the </p><p>urban residents. </p><p> </p><p>--Prior to the election, nearly half the respondents--49.3 </p><p>percent--thought the elections would be violent or very </p><p>violent.  In Harare and Bulawayo, 64.4 percent and 52.3 </p><p>percent thought it would be violent or very violent, </p><p>respectively.  The post-election survey revealed that 64.1 </p><p>percent of respondents thought the aftermath of the election </p><p>was very calm with little to no violence or intimidation </p><p>(68.5 percent in the rural areas and 59.6 percent in urban </p><p>ones).  In Harare and Bulawayo, 50.9 and 79.4 percent thought </p><p>the post-election period was calm. </p><p> </p><p>--Well over 50 percent of respondents in every province but </p><p>one (Masvingo) said Mugabe should make his retirement plans </p><p>known.  This is the one question where there is agreement in </p><p>all provinces regardless of party affiliation and across the </p><p>rural/urban, gender, and age divides. </p><p> </p><p>LAND IRRELEVANT </p><p>--------------- </p><p>7.  Prior to the election, respondents identified democracy </p><p>and good governance as the most important issue for the </p><p>government to address. After the election, the most important </p><p>issue was the economy.  The least important issue in both the </p><p>pre- and post-election surveys was the land issue in both </p><p>rural and urban constituencies. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>8. We suspect that some respondents--particularly those in </p><p>rural areas--were suspicious of poll takers and might not </p><p>have been completely honest.  Sithole posited that most of </p><p>those who would not reveal for whom they voted likely voted </p><p>for Tsvangirai.  We have no way of confirming this nor does a </p><p>comparison of MPOI and ZESN voting statistics suggest this </p><p>voting pattern.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
