Retired Gen. Evren is quoted as saying, </p><p>Turkey at that time invaded more territory than was </p><p>originally planned. They did this to ensure a negotiable </p><p>portion for bargaining.  He said that the UN plan brings a </p><p>historic chance and called on the concerned parties to work </p><p>for a settlement.  "CNN Turk" carried out the interview, and </p><p>the "Hurriyet" report also mentions that the two Greek </p><p>television stations, "Antenna TV" and "Mega TV" will re- </p><p>broadcast it. </p><p>All papers report opposition leader Baykal\'s statement about </p><p>the Cyprus plan, in which he says `it is not going to bring </p><p>peace to the island in its present form\'.  The CHP leader </p><p>received a briefing from the Foreign Ministry and warned </p><p>against losing the two-community structure of the island if </p><p>the Kofi Annan plan is adopted. </p><p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Abdullah Gul gave an interview to </p><p>"Radikal" and emphasized that `no solution is the best </p><p>solution for Cyprus\' is not the approach they will be </p><p>pursuing.  Gul spoke in a determined tone to work for a </p><p>settlement and called the Annan plan negotiable. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" reports that British Rep. for Cyprus Sir David </p><p>Hannay is to visit Ankara this weekend for consultations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan, EU: Papers continue to report AKP leader Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan\'s lobbying in various European capitals.  His </p><p>meetings with the British PM as well as EU officials in </p><p>Brussels was the media highlight of the day.  Erdogan </p><p>repeated Turkey\'s determination to join the EU and </p><p>underlined the expectation that the Copenhagen summit would </p><p>provide a date for negotiations.  "Milliyet" says that </p><p>following his consultations with the EU so far, Erdogan had </p><p>reached a point (in moving discussions forward) at which the </p><p>upcoming EU summit might set a date for Turkey in order to </p><p>set a calendar for the accession program, and that would be </p><p>good enough at this point.  "Radikal" as well as "Zaman" </p><p>front Erdogan\'s pragmatic approach toward the EU as he </p><p>suggested to take on "EU-Cyprus-ESDP" as a package. </p><p>"Radikal" says this approach is quite a contradiction to </p><p>Ankara\'s traditional policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NATO Summit/Bush-Sezer: All papers highlight the Bush-Sezer </p><p>meeting during the NATO summit.  Reports carry a positive </p><p>tone and emphasize the US support for Turkey\'s EU accession </p><p>which Bush personally expressed to Sezer.  According to the </p><p>reports, Bush-Sezer meeting focused on three items: Iraq, EU </p><p>and Cyprus.  Bush reaffirmed the US\'s commitment to protect </p><p>Iraq\'s territorial integrity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Speaker Hastert: "Cumhuriyet" mentions that Speaker Hastert </p><p>is heading a Congressional delegation and is to see Prime </p><p>Minister Abdullah Gul as well as Parliamentary </p><p>Speaker/Acting President, Bulent Arinc. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Kurdish Broadcast: Higher Council of Radio and Television </p><p>[RTUK] announced that it has finished the necessary </p><p>regulation-drafting work so that (national TV network) "TRT" </p><p>can initiate Kurdish broadcasting.  According to the final </p><p>regulation the Kurdish broadcast will be 4 hours radio, and </p><p>2 hours television in a week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Supreme Court\'s torture verdict:  Papers report a verdict </p><p>from the High Court of Appeal on torture.  The Supreme Court </p><p>turned down a local court\'s decision to acquit two policemen </p><p>used torture against a thief in order to have him confessed. </p><p>The court\'s verdict says, torture is a crime against </p><p>humanity and under no circumstances it shall be considered </p><p>as an excuse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq/UN Inspection </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hans Blix and the Hawks" </p><p>Fikret Ertan wrote in the Islamic-intellectual Zaman </p><p>(11/21): "The only obstacle before the US about its Iraq </p><p>operation plan is the current UN inspection process in Iraq, </p><p>and the upcoming report to UNSC.  This report is going to be </p><p>a very critical one because it will actually come up with an </p><p>opinion on whether there is a need for use of force against </p><p>Iraq. . In sum, the Hans Blix report will pave the way </p><p>either for peace or war.  He stands as a target against the </p><p>anti-Iraq group, i.e. the hawks, in the Bush administration. </p><p>They consider Blix over-moderate and tolerant toward Iraq. . </p><p>Hans Blix concentrates his efforts on finding a way to </p><p>cooperate with Iraq first rather than rushing into a </p><p>conflict with Iraq.  His goal is to disarm Iraq without any </p><p>armed conflict.  Let\'s hope he succeeds and Iraq has got the </p><p>message. .because the hawks will not miss any little chance </p><p>to use against Iraq." </p><p></p></div>
