IN COORDINATION WITH THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP), THE </p><p>IRAQI MINISTRY OF TRADE (MOT) COORDINATED THIS FIRST POST- </p><p>CONFLICT PDS RATION DISTRIBUTION, RELYING ON A NATIONWIDE NETWORK </p><p>OF 44,000 FOOD AGENTS TO DISTRIBUTE THE RATIONS TO ALL IRAQI </p><p>CITIZENS.  THE JUNE DISTRIBUTION IS GENERALLY BEING CHARACTERIZED </p><p>AS A "SUCCESS" BY MOT OFFICIALS, WFP, AND RATION RECIPIENTS, </p><p>DESPITE SOME RATION ITEMS MISSING FROM THE RATION BASKET.  IT IS </p><p>ESTIMATED THAT IN 15 OF THE COUNTRY\'S 18 GOVERNORATES, WHERE </p><p>SECURITY ALLOWED FOR ADEQUATE DISTRIBUTION AND REPORTING, MORE </p><p>THAN 98 PERCENT OF THE FLOUR/FOOD AGENTS COLLECTED THEIR MONTHLY </p><p>ALLOCATIONS FOR DISTRIBUTION TO FINAL BENEFICIARIES.  THE PDS </p><p>RATION DISTRIBUTION FOR JULY IS UNDERWAY WITH NO SIGNIFICANT </p><p>PROBLEMS REPORTED.  AS OF THE BEGINNING OF JULY, WFP REPORTS THAT </p><p>1,264,743 MT OF FOOD WERE DISPATCHED THROUGHOUT IRAQ SINCE APRIL. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>THE DISTRIBUTION OF WHAT IS NORMALLY ABOUT 500,000 MT PER MONTH </p><p>OF FOOD AND NON-FOOD COMMODITIES IN IRAQ RESTARTED IN EARLY JUNE </p><p>AFTER A TWO AND ONE- HALF-MONTH DISRUPTION DUE TO THE CONFLICT IN </p><p>THE COUNTRY.  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PDS TO THE FOOD SECURITY OF </p><p>THE IRAQI POPULATION CANNOT BE OVERSTATED.  THE RATIONING SYSTEM, </p><p>DESIGNED BY THE FORMER REGIME, STARTED IN THE EARLY 1990S WHEN </p><p>FOOD MARKETS WERE DISRUPTED AS A RESULT OF THE FIRST GULF WAR. </p><p>IT EVOLVED AS THE PRIMARY SOURCE FOR DISTRIBUTED BASIC FOOD AND </p><p>NON-FOOD COMMODITIES RECEIVED UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS OIL-FOR- </p><p>FOOD (OFF) PROGRAM TO ALL IRAQIS STARTED IN 1996.  COMMODITIES </p><p>WERE MOSTLY IMPORTED THROUGH THE OFF PROGRAM, THENAND THEN PARSED </p><p>OUT THROUGH THE PDS.  THIS RATION SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO COVER 100 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE IRAQI POPULATION WITH BASIC FOOD AND NON-FOOD </p><p>SUPPLIES.  SIXTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION DEPEND ON THESE </p><p>RATIONS AS THEIR ONLY SOURCE OF FOOD.  THE SYSTEM INCLUDES A </p><p>COMPUTERIZED REGISTRATION/RATION CARD SYSTEM--STORING INFORMATION </p><p>ON INDIVIDUAL RATION LEVELS, STORAGE OF LOCAL AND OFF-PURCHASED </p><p>COMMODITIES--PARTICULARLY WHEAT GRAIN--THROUGH LOCAL PUBLIC </p><p>WAREHOUSES AND GRAIN SILOS, AND DISTRIBUTION THROUGH A NATIONWIDE </p><p>RATION AGENT NETWORK.  UNDER THE CURRENT SIX-MONTH EMERGENCY </p><p>OPERATION, WFP PLANS TO IMPORT APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION MT OF </p><p>FOOD COMMODITIES TO IRAQ, LARGELY TO SUPPORT THE PDS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>JUNE RATION DISTRIBUTIONS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>JUNE IS WIDELY VIEWED AS A SUCCESS.  WFP REPORTS THAT </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 94 PERCENT OF THE FOOD AGENTS COLLECTED THEIR </p><p>MONTHLY ALLOWANCES FOR JUNE.  THREE GOVERNORATES--AL ANBAR, </p><p>DIYALA, AND SALAH-AD-DIN--WERE PLAGUED BY SECURITY CONCERNS THAT </p><p>LIKELY HAMPERED FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND HAVE LED TO UNDERREPORTING. </p><p>INFORMATION THAT WE DO HAVE FROM  THESE THREE GOVERNORATES </p><p>INDICATE THAT ONLY 55 PERCENT OF THE RATION ITEMS THAT SHOULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED WAS ACTUALLY COLLECTED BY THE FOOD AGENTS. </p><p>THE NATIONAL AVERAGE COVERAGE RATE, NOT INCLUDING THESE </p><p>GOVERNORATES, IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL 98 PERCENT.  IN TOTAL, REPORTS </p><p>TO DATE INDICATE THAT 396,013 MT OF COMMODITIES HAVE BEEN </p><p>DISTRIBUTED TO FOOD AGENTS.  AS OF THE END OF JUNE, TOTAL </p><p>DISPATCHES TO IRAQ SINCE IMPORTS RESUMED IN APRIL, STAND AT </p><p>1,264,743 MT.  NO MAJOR PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY WFP FIELD </p><p>OFFICES FACILITATING AND MONITORING THE DISTRIBUTION PROCESS, </p><p>THOUGH CHALLENGES CONTINUE TO BE RELATED TO SECURITY FOR </p><p>WAREHOUSES, SILOS, AND TRUCK TRANSPORTERS IN THE SOUTHERN AND </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNORATES.  THE PRINCIPAL CHALLENGE IN THE NORTHERN </p><p>GOVERNORATES IS THE TRANSITION FROM FULL WFP ADMINISTRATION OF </p><p>THE PDS TO LOCAL ADMINISTRATION BY NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>THE PDS RATION CYCLE NORMALLY TAKES PLACE OVER A PERIOD OF </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 20 DAYS.  FOR JUNE, THE RATION PERIOD CONTINUED </p><p>THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE MONTH AND INTO EARLY JULY FOR THOSE AREAS </p><p>WHERE SECURITY AND OTHER PROBLEMS PREVENTED COMPLETION WITHIN THE </p><p>20 DAYS.  THE JUNE RATION, THAT IS BASED ON AVAILABILITY OF </p><p>STOCKS, CONTAINED 9 KG OF WHEAT FLOUR, 3 KG OF RICE, 2 KG OF </p><p>SUGAR, 0.2 KG OF TEA, 1.0 KG OF VEGETABLE OIL, 0.25 KG OF PULSES, </p><p>0.25 KG OF SOAP, AND 0.5 KG OF DETERGENT.  INFANTS UNDER THE AGE </p><p>OF ONE YEAR RECEIVE 3.6 KG OF INFANT FORMULA, 0.25 KG OF SOAP, </p><p>AND 0.5 KG OF DETERGENT.  THESE QUANTITIES REFLECT AN ABSENCE OF </p><p>ADULT MILK AND LOWER QUANTITIES OF OIL AND PULSES IN A RATION. </p><p>THE JULY RATION MIX INCREASED FOR PULSES AND MILK POWDER, </p><p>ALTHOUGH STILL NOT AT THE FULL RATION LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>ACCESS TO AND QUALITY OF RATIONS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>A SERIES OF RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCASTS FOR THE IRAQI </p><p>POPULACE BEGAN ON MAY 30, EXPLAINING WHAT THE RATION BASKET WOULD </p><p>CONTAIN AND WHEN RATION RECIPIENTS SHOULD GO TO THEIR REGISTERED </p><p>FOOD AGENTS TO COLLECT THE FOOD.  THE DISTRIBUTION OF FALSE </p><p>RATION CARDS WAS REPORTED IN SOME GOVERNORATES, AND A GENERAL </p><p>BELIEF THAT THE RATION WOULD BE EXPANDED BEYOND PREVIOUS LEVELS, </p><p>LED TO UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS IN SOME AREAS.  THESE FALSE </p><p>RUMORS ARE ALSO EMERGING FOR THE JULY CYCLE; HOWEVER, THEY ARE </p><p>BEING COUNTEREDCORRECTED BY MOT ANNOUNCEMENTS.  RATION RECIPIENTS </p><p>ARE GENERALLY PLEASED TO BE RECEIVING BETTER QUALITY COMMODITIES </p><p>WITH THE JUNE DISTRIBUTION, AS THERE HAD BEEN A NUMBER OF </p><p>COMPLAINTS OVER THE YEARS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF RATIONS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY RICE AND FLOUR.  RATION RECIPIENTS ARE ESPECIALLY </p><p>PLEASED TO RECEIVE VEGETABLE OIL FOR THE FIRST TIME RATHER THAN </p><p>GHEE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT THE U.S. </p><p>SOYBEAN-BASED VEGETABLE OIL, UNFAMILIAR TO IRAQI TASTES, IS NOT </p><p>AS WELL LIKED AS OTHER VEGETABLE OILS.  LIKEWISE, THE HIGHLY </p><p>REFINED WHEAT FLOUR FROM THE U.S. IS NOT AS SUITABLE AS MORE </p><p>COARSELY GROUND WHEAT FOR MAKING FLAT BREADS BAKED BY THE TYPICAL </p><p>IRAQI HOUSEHOLD. </p><p>FOR THOSE BENEFICIARIES PREVIOUSLY REMOVED FROM THE PDS, THE MOT </p><p>ESTABLISHED REREGISTRATION PROCEDURES.  BENEFICIARIES WHO HAD </p><p>BEEN REMOVED FROM THE PDS ROLES, LOST THEIR RATION CARDS, WERE </p><p>DISPLACED WITHIN THE COUNTRY, OR HAD CHANGES IN THEIR FAMILY </p><p>STATUS WERE ABLE TO REREGISTER AT THEIR PRESENT LOCATION TO </p><p>ENSURE THEIR PROPER RECEIPT OF RATION COMMODITIES.  THIS IS </p><p>PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY IN THE MOST SOUTHERN GOVERNORATES, WHICH </p><p>HAD A NUMBER OF DISENFRANCHISED IRAQIS SUCCESSFULLY REREGISTERED. </p><p>THIS PROCESS, HOWEVER, DID NOT ALWAYS WORK AS PLANNED.  IN </p><p>DIYALA, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 48,000 INTERNALLY </p><p>DISPLACED PERSONS  WEREPERSONS, MANY OF WHOM WERE NOT ABLE TO </p><p>REGISTER TO RECEIVE THEIR JUNE RATION ON TIME.  THE DANISH </p><p>REFUGEE COUNCIL, AN NGO PARTNERING WITH WFP, IS WORKING WITH THIS </p><p>GROUP TO FACILITATE THE REGISTRATION PROCESS AND TO DISTRIBUTE </p><p>THE JUNE RATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>INCREASED COSTS TO FOOD AGENTS/OVERCHARGING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>RATION RECIPIENTS PAY A NOMINAL FEE TO FOOD AGENTS FOR THE PDS </p><p>RATIONS THEY RECEIVE.  THE JUNE FEE FOR THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNORATES WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF 20 CENTS U.S.--250 IRAQI </p><p>DINARS (ID)--PER RECIPIENT AND IN THE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES THE </p><p>FEE WAS EQUIVALENT TO 40 CENTS U.S.  IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR </p><p>THE HIGHER TRANSPORT AND LOADING/OFF-LOADING COSTS, SOME FOOD </p><p>AGENTS CHARGE MORE THAN THE ALLOWED RATION FEE.  FOOD AGENTS </p><p>CHARGING 600 ID IS NOT UNCOMMON IN SOME GOVERNORATES, WITH </p><p>REPORTS OF AGENTS CHARGING IN EXCESS OF 1,000 ID PER BENEFICIARY. </p><p> </p><p>THIS OVERCHARGING WAS DUE, IN PART, TO THE HIGHER TRANSPORTATION </p><p>COSTS INCURRED BY AGENTS.   THE ALLOWANCE THE MOT PROVIDED TO THE </p><p>FOOD AGENTS FOR TRANSPORTATION COSTS DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT </p><p>THE INCREASING PRICE OF FUEL OR THE AGENTS MAKING RETURN TRIPS TO </p><p>WAREHOUSES TO COLLECT FOOD THAT HAD ARRIVED AFTER INITIAL PICKUP. </p><p>SOME FOOD AGENTS COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS NO LONGER WORTH THEIR </p><p>WHILE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE PDS.  IN RESPONSE TO THESE </p><p>ISSUES, THE MOT ANNOUNCED THAT THE ALLOWANCE FOR AGENTS WOULD BE </p><p>INCREASED FOR THE JULY PDS CYCLE.  FROM THE 250 ID COLLECTED FROM </p><p>THE RATION RECIPIENTS IN THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL GOVERNORATES, </p><p>FOOD AGENTS CAN NOW KEEP 50 ID IN URBAN AREAS AND 60 ID IN RURAL </p><p>AREAS, TO OFFSET THEIR HIGHER TRANSPORTATION COSTS.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>AGENTS ARE NOW ALLOWED TO RETAIN 50 ID PER RECIPIENT AS A PROFIT, </p><p>UP FROM 20 ID IN JUNE.  THESE ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES REPRESENT AN </p><p>INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 240-280 PERCENT OVER THE JUNE CHARGES </p><p>THE AGENTS WERE ALLOWED TO RETAIN.  EQUIVALENT COMPENSATION HAS </p><p>ALSO BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES FOR JULY.  IT </p><p>IS HOPED THAT THESE INCREASED AMOUNTS WILL PREVENT AGENTS FROM </p><p>OVERCHARGING.  ENFORCEMENT OF OVERCHARGING BY MOT DID NOT OCCUR </p><p>IN JUNE DUE TO THE MANY ISSUES INVOLVED WITH THE PDS STARTUP, BUT </p><p>BEGAN WITH THE JULY DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ALSO, A SIGNIFICANT SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION IS SELLING PART OF </p><p>THEIR RATION--GENERALLY WHEAT FLOUR--TO GENERATE ENOUGH MONEY TO </p><p>PAY THEIR RATION FEES OR TO BUY OTHER FOOD COMMODITIES SUCH AS </p><p>FRESH FRUITS, VEGETABLES, AND MEAT.  THE WFP AND MOT\'S MONITORING </p><p>AND EVALUATION UNITS CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS TREND. </p><p>HOWEVER, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF AN ORGANIZED, LARGE-SCALE </p><p>DIVERSION OF FOOD AID FROM THE PDS FOR COMMERCIALIZATION IN URBAN </p><p>MARKETS. </p><p> </p><p>-- ----------------------------------- </p><p>SECURITY--THE SINGLE LARGEST ISSUE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR MOT AND WFP IN MAKING </p><p>THE PDS FULLY FUNCTIONAL.  COALITION FORCES (CF) ARE NOW </p><p>PROTECTING MANY MOT FACILITIES IN THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNORATES, INCLUDING WAREHOUSES AND SILOS.  MOT OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING THEIR OWN GUARD FORCE.  WORKING WITH THE </p><p>MOT, WFP HAS PROVIDED THE COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY (CPA) </p><p>WITH A COMPLETE LIST OF SILOS, MILLS, AND WAREHOUSES IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY IN AN ATTEMPT TO ENSURE THAT PROPER SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS </p><p>CAN BE MADE.  CPA IS TRAINING MOT GUARDS TO PROTECT WAREHOUSES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN BAGHDAD AND AL BASRAH--TWO OF THE MAIN STORAGE </p><p>HUBS PLAGUED BY LOOTING.  ALSO IN AL BASRAH, THE RATION </p><p>REGISTRATION CENTER HAS BEEN BURNT AND 18 TRUCKS DAMAGED.  WFP IS </p><p>HELPING TO GATHER LOST DATA, SUPPLY NEW COMPUTERS, AND ORGANIZE </p><p>COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT FOR THE RATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>IN BAGHDAD, FOR EXAMPLE, NEARLY 500 GUARDS ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT </p><p>RATION ITEMS IN 14 FACILITIES INCLUDING SILOS, WAREHOUSES, AND </p><p>DISTRIBUTION CENTERS.  MANY ARE WITHOUT UNIFORMS AND EVEN FEWER </p><p>HAVE GUNS.  IN A MID-JUNE ASSESSMENT OF SIX FACILITIES, FOUR HAD </p><p>CF PRESENCE.  ONGOING UNREST AND THEFT AT THE AL HURRIYA </p><p>WAREHOUSE MEANT THAT WFP WAS FORCED TO TEMPORARILY WITHDRAW ITS </p><p>PRESENCE UNTIL CF RETURNED AND THE SITUATION STABILIZED. </p><p> </p><p>THE HIGHJACKING OF TRUCKS CARRYING PDS COMMODITIES, PARTICULARLY </p><p>OVER A 150-MILE STRETCH FROM SAFWAN (JUST OVER THE KUWAIT BORDER </p><p>TO AN NASIRIYAH) WAS QUITE PROBLEMATIC IN JUNE.  THESE </p><p>HIGHJACKINGS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY VIOLENT WITH REPORTS OF </p><p>DEATHS AND MISSING TRUCKERS.  ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, THE </p><p>KUWAIT-OWNED TRUCKS, LADEN WITH WFP FOOD, REFUSED TO TRAVEL. </p><p>COALITION FORCES, WFP, AND TRUCKERS\' REPRESENTATIVES CONTINUE TO </p><p>WORK ON WAYS TO REDUCE THE PROBLEM.  BECAUSE THE HIGHJACKINGS ARE </p><p>DIRECTED MORE AT NON-IRAQI TRUCKS, WFP HAS RESTRICTED POINT-OF- </p><p>ENTRY FOR FOOD FROM KUWAIT, TO UMM QASR AND AL BASARH. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>TRANSITION OF PDS TO FULL MOT MANAGEMENT </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP FOR PDS COMMODITIES AND PIPELINE </p><p>MANAGEMENT FROM WFP TO MOT CONTINUES.  WFP IN KIRKUK (NINAWA </p><p>GOVERNORATE), FOR EXAMPLE, HAS SIGNED OVER RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL </p><p>COMMODITIES TO THE MOT, AND IS NOW IMPLEMENTING ONLY PRIMARY </p><p>TRANSPORT, OFF-LOADING, AND MONITORING.  BOTH WFP AND MOT SIGN </p><p>THE WAYBILLS FOR RECEIPT AT THE SILO OR WAREHOUSE, AND MOT IS </p><p>THEN RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING FOOD AGENTS\' TRANSPORT AND </p><p>DISTRIBUTIONS.  HOWEVER, WFP REMAINS ULTIMATELY ACCOUNTABLE TO </p><p>ITS DONORS FOR ENSURING THAT THE COMMODITIES ARE DISTRIBUTED </p><p>PROPERLY.  HENCE, WFP MAINTAINS ITS MONITORING FUNCTION. </p><p> </p><p>ON JULY 16, CPA PRESENTED A LETTER TO WFP, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WFP </p><p>AND CPA MUST MOVE QUICKLY TO TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PDS </p><p>IN THE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES OF AS SULAYMANIYAH, ARBIL, AND DAHUK </p><p>TO IRAQI AUTHORITIES.  CPA DESIGNATED THE FOOD DEPARTMENT IN </p><p>ARBIL AS THE APPROPRIATE LOCAL AUTHORITY, AND WFP HAS BEGUN </p><p>IDENTIFYING CRITICAL NEEDS TO ENSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION.  THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL CHALLENGE IN THE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES IS THE </p><p>TRANSITION FROM FULL WFP ADMINISTRATION OF THE PDS TO LOCAL </p><p>AUTHORITY ADMINISTRATION BY NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>IN BAGHDAD, WFP, MOT, CPA, AND THE DART CONTINUE TO MEET </p><p>FREQUENTLY TO ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THE PDS DISTRIBUTION </p><p>CYCLE.  IDEALLY, BEFORE THE END OF THE CURRENT WFP EMERGENCY </p><p>OPERATION IN OCTOBER, IRAQI AUTHORITIES CAN ASSUME FULL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PDS OR FIND OTHER MECHANISMS TO ENSURE </p><p>FOOD SECURITY IN THE COUNTRY.  SPELLING OUT THE OPTIONS FOR THIS </p><p>AND STEPS TO IMPLEMENT A TRANSITION IS, IN PART, THE FOCUS OF A </p><p>WORKING GROUP, INCLUDING USAID, CPA, WFP, AND THE MOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                          UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p></div>
