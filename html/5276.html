<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 SANAA 000166 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO, DAS ELIZABETH CHENEY, NEA/RA OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR GARY GRAPPO, ANE.AA (ANE) DAVID COWLES, ECA </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY CHARLOTTE BEERS, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAID, PREL, SCUL, KDEM, KPAO, YM, DEMOCRATIC REFORM, ECON/COM, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: SANAA RESPONSE TO NEXT STEPS ON U.S. - MIDDLE EAST </p><p>PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE (MEPI) </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 15081 </p><p>     B. SANAA 96 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary:  As the least developed country in the NEA </p><p>region, Yemen is likely to show rapid, tangible results from </p><p>well-conceived MEPI-funded programming. The ROYG has welcomed </p><p>the initiative warmly and publicly, and Foreign Minister Dr. </p><p>Abu Bakr Al-Qirbi will send a letter to Secretary Powell in </p><p>the coming days to welcome MEPI and suggest applications for </p><p>Yemen. In addition, the imminent return of USAID to Embassy </p><p>Sanaa will help to ensure that post has the capacity to </p><p>manage MEPI funds and implement expanded programming </p><p>effectively. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Embassy Sanaa is dedicated to the Middle East </p><p>Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and has made MEPI an important </p><p>component of post,s Mission Performance Plan (MPP). In fact, </p><p>MEPI funding will be critical in achieving the Mission,s </p><p>strategic goals and objectives in the next few years. Post </p><p>appreciates the opportunity to provide thoughts as requested </p><p>in ref A.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>MEPI Goals and Objectives </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Education reform, economic reform, political reform, </p><p>digital readiness, and women,s empowerment are very relevant </p><p>to Yemen and areas where the ROYG is committed to progress. </p><p>The main obstacle to progress, however, is that Yemen has few </p><p>resources from which to draw upon in each of these areas and </p><p>relies heavily on donor assistance. </p><p> </p><p>In education reform, for example, the emphasis would be on </p><p>literacy and availability of basic education more than on </p><p>higher education. The objective in E1 referring to promotion </p><p>of participatory learning and critical thinking skills is </p><p>better situated to some of the wealthier states in the region </p><p>than to Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>In economic reform, for example, Yemen is in dire need of </p><p>technical assistance to strengthen its commercial legal </p><p>systems and banking systems (ER2). Reform of these systems </p><p>will not only boost foreign direct investment in Yemen but is </p><p>also necessary for Yemen,s accession into the WTO and in </p><p>meeting the criteria of the Millennium Challenge Fund. </p><p> </p><p>In political reform, Yemen\'s nascent democracy needs the </p><p>support envisioned under the MEPI goals and objectives, </p><p>including strengthened political parties, developed local </p><p>councils, increased women\'s participation, improved election </p><p>administration, professionalized media and a reformed </p><p>judiciary. With continued support, Yemen,s vibrant democracy </p><p>(Yemen has the most active democracy on the Arabian </p><p>Peninsula) will be better equipped to face the challenges </p><p>that lie ahead. </p><p> </p><p>In digital readiness cross-cut, the Ministry of Education </p><p>lacks the resources to institute multi-media, broadcast, and </p><p>Internet-based educational programming in the school system </p><p>(DR3). As such, there is a general lack of information and </p><p>communication technology knowledge. Fundamental skills, </p><p>related to digital readiness, must first be developed before </p><p>a digital marketplace can effectively take root in Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>In women,s empowerment cross-cut, reducing the drop-out rate </p><p>of adolescent girls combined with women,s literacy programs </p><p>is an important first step in empowering Yemeni women. In a </p><p>country where two-thirds of all women are illiterate, basic </p><p>women,s education programs must be the focus rather than </p><p>increasing the number of successful female business owners </p><p>and office holders as stated in WE1 and WE3. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  A central theme of the Post,s MPP is "no security </p><p>without development, and no development without security." </p><p>MEPI funding for visible, high-impact programs will thus </p><p>buttress and help sustain progress on fundamental U.S. </p><p>counter-terrorism goals in Yemen. The MEPI goals and </p><p>objectives provide a good framework for helping Post target </p><p>key sectors and regions for rapid tangible results and </p><p>maximum impact against the existing support network for </p><p>Islamist extremism. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>FY  02 Supplemental Notional Program Planning </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Post would like to enhance its presence in FY  02 </p><p>programming in region-wide and post-specific programs. For </p><p>instance, the Incentives Program for Girls to Stay in School </p><p>is extremely relevant to Yemen, with a girl,s illiteracy </p><p>rate of 67.5%, and Yemen Government institutions are in great </p><p>need of Information Technology assistance. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  The Yemen political party and tribal council training </p><p>program already allocated is vital to Yemen,s democratic </p><p>development.  In addition, however, parliamentary elections </p><p>in April will be the most competitive parliamentary elections </p><p>since unification in 1990 and could impact negatively on </p><p>Yemen,s political reform efforts.  A vigorous domestic and </p><p>international election observation effort to increase the </p><p>confidence of Yemeni citizens in the election process and </p><p>help alleviate possible violence is vital to the </p><p>sustainability of democratic progress. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>FY ,03 MEPI Proposed Programs </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  Post has developed four program proposals that fit </p><p>directly with the MEPI goals and is in the process of </p><p>identifying and developing other programs. The four proposed </p><p>programs that are being proposed for inclusion in the FY ,03 </p><p>MEPI program are defined below, with details septels: </p><p> </p><p>Strengthening Education in Rural Areas in Yemen: In-Service </p><p>training for primary school teachers and administrators in </p><p>selected underserved and disadvantaged governorates. This </p><p>program fits directly with the "Education Reform" MEPI goal </p><p>and its objective to "Expand access to, and quality of, basic </p><p>formal education, particularly for girls." </p><p> </p><p>Eradicating Women,s Illiteracy in Yemen: Providing basic </p><p>literacy and life skills courses for adult women in selected </p><p>underserved and disadvantaged governorates. This program fits </p><p>the "Education Reform" MEPI goal and its objective to "Expand </p><p>access to, and quality of, basic formal education, </p><p>particularly for girls." </p><p> </p><p>Providing the Internet to Yemeni High Schools and NGOs: </p><p>Providing internet classrooms in high schools and access to </p><p>internet for (mainly women,s) NGOs. This program fits the </p><p>"Digital Readiness" MEPI cross cutting issue; the "Education </p><p>Reform" MEPI goal and its objective to "Expand access to, and </p><p>quality of, basic formal education, particularly for girls." </p><p>See ref B. </p><p> </p><p>Raising Awareness on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM): An </p><p>activity to encourage the establishment of laws prohibiting </p><p>the practice of FGM, and increasing the capacity of a Yemeni </p><p>women,s advocacy NGO, the National Women,s Committee (NWC). </p><p>This program fits the "Women,s Empowerment" MEPI cross </p><p>cutting issue, and more specifically, the goal to "Support </p><p>founding, growth and networking of NGOs advocating equality </p><p>of women." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Other MEPI Opportunities in Yemen </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  Post has identified other areas in which MEPI can </p><p>play a significant role. Strategically targeted MEPI-funded </p><p>programming will play a significant role in ensuring </p><p>continued and enhanced economic development, political reform </p><p>and security, which are vital to Yemen\'s stability, an </p><p>essential ingredient in the global war on terror. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
