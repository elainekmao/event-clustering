(SBU) Summary and Introduction:  USTR Special Textile </p><p>Negotiator David Spooner led a 10 person USG delegation to </p><p>Hanoi to begin negotiation of a bilateral textile agreement. </p><p>The negotiations, originally scheduled to take place </p><p>February 19-21, were shortened by half because weather </p><p>conditions in Washington delayed the departure of most </p><p>members of the U.S. delegation by two days.  After a brief </p><p>review of the three draft agreements tabled by the U.S. (a </p><p>textile agreement, visa arrangement, and a market access </p><p>agreement for U.S. textiles/apparel), the Vietnamese argued </p><p>against inclusion of a labor provision within the textile </p><p>agreement and against negotiation of a market access </p><p>agreement at this time.  The GVN was not able to provide the </p><p>U.S. side with a counter proposal on quota categories and </p><p>levels prior to the delegation\'s departure.  While the GVN </p><p>did agree to a second round of negotiations in Washington in </p><p>March or April, they were unable to agree to set a specific </p><p>date during the talks.  On February 24, econoff met with MOT </p><p>officials from both the America\'s Desk and the Import-Export </p><p>Office to strongly reiterated the US delegation\'s request </p><p>for a GVN proposal for specific dates for the next round of </p><p>negotiations and for a counter offer on quota levels.  On </p><p>February 28, MOT\'s Import-Export office proposed the week of </p><p>April 7-12 for the next round in Washington and informed </p><p>Embassy that they would not be able to provide a counter </p><p>offer on quotas at this time as they are currently </p><p>collecting comments from business community but would </p><p>provide it to the Embassy "as soon as they can."  End </p><p>Summary and introduction. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Delegation Opening Remarks </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In its opening remarks the U.S. delegation </p><p>encouraged the GVN to look at textile negotiations as a </p><p>normal part of the process of building a trade relationship </p><p>with the U.S. While the U.S. is in the process of </p><p>integrating quotas under the Agreement on Textiles and </p><p>Clothing (ATC), for now they still exist, even for WTO </p><p>member countries.  The U.S. has textile agreements with </p><p>every major Asian supplier, some of who are WTO members. </p><p>The U.S.- Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), which </p><p>came into effect in December 2001, has been successful in </p><p>integrating Vietnam into the world economy and boosting </p><p>Vietnam\'s textile and apparel exports to the U.S. by almost </p><p>1600 percent.  Vietnam has become a top twenty supplier to </p><p>the U.S. in some categories and a top ten supplier </p><p>(capturing 5 percent or more of the market) in others.  The </p><p>U.S. delegation  congratulated Vietnam on it success, but </p><p>noted that it is that success that necessitated holding </p><p>textile negotiations now.  Ultimately the need for </p><p>negotiations should not be a surprise to the GVN, the U.S. </p><p>delegation argued, as the issue was discussed many times </p><p>both during BTA negotiations and after the BTA came into </p><p>effect. The U.S. delegation highlighted the importance of </p><p>these talks to the USG, emphasized the U.S. had waited </p><p>almost a year after the BTA to request negotiations, and </p><p>reminded the GVN that it is in both sides\' interest to </p><p>conclude the negotiations quickly. </p><p> </p><p>GVN Opening Remarks </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The GVN acknowledged the positive impact the BTA </p><p>has had on both indirect and direct trade between the U.S. </p><p>and Vietnam and noted that there are now 700 U.S. companies </p><p>doing business in Vietnam in a wide range of sectors.  The </p><p>GVN reminded the U.S. side that Vietnam had extended MFN </p><p>treatment to U.S. imports two years before the BTA took </p><p>effect and was ahead of schedule in implementing some of its </p><p>BTA commitments on services. The best way to continue </p><p>encouraging bilateral trade is to continue Vietnam\'s quota </p><p>free period, the GVN argued.  Vietnamese textile/apparel </p><p>exports to the U.S. were only significant in the last half </p><p>of 2002, the GVN argued, and even then volume was modest </p><p>(about 1.6 percent of U.S. textile and apparel imports). </p><p>Under the BTA, the U.S. and Vietnam agreed to eliminate </p><p>trade barriers consistent with WTO rules.  Textile quotas </p><p>should be considered a type of trade barrier, the GVN </p><p>argued. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The GVN highlighted its status as a developing </p><p>country and downplayed the size of its textile industry, </p><p>noting that it is not as well developed as China\'s or </p><p>Pakistan\'s industry and that, while the growth rate of </p><p>Vietnam\'s textile exports in 2002 was high, the absolute </p><p>value of textile exports to the U.S. is modest compared to </p><p>ASEAN countries and the rest of the world.  For example, </p><p>Cambodian textile exports to the U.S. in 2002 were worth </p><p>more than USD one billion; Vietnam has not reached that </p><p>level yet, the GVN asserted.  The GVN also argued that </p><p>Vietnam\'s textile exports are not damaging the U.S. domestic </p><p>industry or U.S. trade partners in the Western hemisphere. </p><p>Although in 2002 the U.S. textile industry declined </p><p>slightly, the GVN argued, Vietnam\'s exports were a shift </p><p>from other countries such as China (which already accounts </p><p>for about 20 percent of global textile exports). </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The GVN also argued that Vietnamese textile exports </p><p>have also benefited both the U.S. and its trade partners. </p><p>In 2002 Vietnam imported about USD 32 million worth of U.S. </p><p>cotton (almost a third of Vietnam\'s total cotton imports). </p><p>Additionally, U.S. trade partners like Taiwan and Korea have </p><p>invested in Vietnam\'s textile industry in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Tables Draft Agreements </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) On the first day of talks, the U.S. delegation </p><p>tabled three draft agreements for the GVN to review:  1) a </p><p>textile and textile product agreement; 2) an agreement on </p><p>market access for textiles and textile products (accompanied </p><p>by a proposed tariff schedule for U.S. textile exports to </p><p>Vietnam); and 3) a visa arrangement for textiles and textile </p><p>products.   The U.S. side tabled proposed quota categories </p><p>and levels (Annex B of the main textile agreement) during </p><p>the second day of talks. </p><p> </p><p>Labor provision </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Section 15 (A, B and C) of the draft textile </p><p>agreement discusses the protection of worker rights.  The </p><p>U.S. delegation explained that this draft labor provision </p><p>broadly encompasses three labor-related negotiating </p><p>objectives contained in the Trade Act of 2002 including:  1) </p><p>promoting respect for worker rights and the rights of </p><p>children consistent with the core labor standards of the </p><p>ILO; 2) seeking provisions in trade agreements under which </p><p>parties will strive to ensure they do not weaken provisions </p><p>in domestic laws in order to encourage trade; and 3) </p><p>promoting ratification and full compliance with ILO </p><p>Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor.  Every </p><p>textile agreement the U.S. has entered into since passage of </p><p>the Trade Act has included a labor clause, as do U.S. trade </p><p>preference programs. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The U.S. side went on to note that the draft labor </p><p>provision specifically reaffirms Vietnam\'s commitment to the </p><p>ILO declaration and highlights U.S.-Vietnam cooperation </p><p>under the 2000 USDOL-Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social </p><p>Affairs (MOLISA) MOU on labor cooperation.  The provision </p><p>does not create new mechanisms or monitoring systems, </p><p>require new factory visits or link quota levels to DOL </p><p>reporting on the labor situation in Vietnam.  The provision </p><p>utilizes the mechanisms established in the MOU giving USDOL </p><p>and MOLISA an opportunity to meet and report on the steps </p><p>the GVN is taking.  The U.S. delegation emphasized that the </p><p>labor provision is intended to be a positive reaffirmation </p><p>of Vietnam\'s commitment to labor rights and an opportunity </p><p>to demonstrate further cooperation on this important issue. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) The GVN delegation argued strongly for removal of </p><p>the labor provision from the textile agreement.  The GVN </p><p>highlighted its cooperative efforts with both the ILO (which </p><p>opened a representative office in Hanoi on February 17) and </p><p>the USG, calling the DOL-MOLISA MOU on labor "the most </p><p>important agreement on labor cooperation between the U.S. </p><p>and Vietnam."  The GVN argued that any additional bilateral </p><p>cooperation activities should be done in the context of the </p><p>MOU and thus there is no need for another agreement on </p><p>labor.  Other countries that have signed trade agreements </p><p>containing a labor provision do not also have such an MOU, </p><p>the Vietnamese delegation added.  The labor clause in the </p><p>Cambodian agreement is an exceptional case and Vietnam does </p><p>not want to be the "second exceptional case". </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The GVN repeatedly stated that it sees labor and </p><p>textiles as two very distinct issues and noted that the WTO </p><p>does not link the two issues.  The delegation also pointed </p><p>out that while a textile agreement is a short-term issue, </p><p>labor rights will be addressed over the long run. In </p><p>addition, contracts between Vietnamese exporters and U.S. </p><p>importers already include provisions to ensure full </p><p>compliance with labor standards.  The GVN also pointed out </p><p>that in the context of the anti-dumping case against </p><p>Vietnamese frozen fish fillets, they believe that the USDOC </p><p>noted that Vietnam had already taken steps on labor </p><p>consistent with international labor principles. </p><p> </p><p>Market access </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The U.S. also provided the GVN the draft text of </p><p>an agreement relating to market access for textiles and </p><p>textile products (and an annex containing proposed tariff </p><p>rates). The U.S. delegation emphasized that such agreements </p><p>are very important to the U.S. domestic textile industry and </p><p>have become a standard feature in U.S. textile agreements. </p><p>The USG believes it is imperative to include this as part of </p><p>the textile negotiations with Vietnam because the BTA does </p><p>not include commitments on market access for U.S. textiles, </p><p>although the U.S. has granted Vietnam MFN rates. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The U.S. delegation explained that many concepts </p><p>in the draft market access agreement are the same as those </p><p>used in WTO accession negotiations.  The U.S. proposed this </p><p>agreement for several reasons:  1) to establish tariff </p><p>bindings for Vietnamese imports of textiles and related </p><p>products from the U.S.; 2) to obtain a commitment from the </p><p>GVN that if it offers rates lower than its bound rates to </p><p>another trade partner, it will also offer these lower rates </p><p>to the U.S.; and 3) to discipline Vietnam\'s use of non- </p><p>tariff measures that would impede access of U.S. textiles to </p><p>Vietnam\'s market.  The U.S. delegation pointed out that the </p><p>proposed tariff rates are drawn from tariff rates Vietnam </p><p>has offered other trade partners. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) The GVN strongly opposed negotiating a market </p><p>access agreement alongside textile negotiations, repeatedly </p><p>suggested such negotiations should be done in the context of </p><p>Vietnam\'s WTO accession negotiations and yet affirmed its </p><p>willingness to negotiate market access "anywhere and </p><p>anytime." If the main objective of a textile agreement is to </p><p>protect the U.S. domestic textile industry, then why </p><p>negotiate market access in this context, the GVN asked.  The </p><p>U.S. hasn\'t done this with other countries.  The textile </p><p>agreements the U.S. has negotiated with 7 or 8 non WTO- </p><p>member countries (most of which have a higher level of </p><p>economic development) do not include market access </p><p>commitments, the GVN complained.  In addition, the National </p><p>Assembly establishes Vietnam\'s tariff schedule and the </p><p>legislature must approve any changes to it. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Noting reports that the GVN has just concluded </p><p>negotiations with the EU to revise the two sides\' textile </p><p>agreement, the U.S. delegation asked the GVN to confirm if </p><p>the revised agreement contained tariff bindings and if the </p><p>GVN would provide the USG with a copy of the agreement.  The </p><p>GVN responded that it had taken 5 to 6 rounds of </p><p>negotiations to reach agreement with the EU, stated the </p><p>agreement had not yet been submitted to either government, </p><p>and noted there was not yet an official text.  The GVN </p><p>acknowledged that the amended agreement did contain some </p><p>tariff reductions, but noted that these had been given in </p><p>exchange for Vietnam receiving GSP benefits from the EU. </p><p>The U.S. has not offered GSP to Vietnam, the GVN added. </p><p> </p><p>Quota levels </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) The U.S. delegation submitted a draft Annex B </p><p>containing proposed quota levels for 41 textile and apparel </p><p>categories as well as suggested growth rates.  The U.S. side </p><p>explained that the quota levels proposed for 2003 were based </p><p>upon the latest trade statistics available - the twelve- </p><p>month period ending in November 2002 - plus a 5 or 10 </p><p>percent increase depending on the category.  The U.S. </p><p>delegation emphasized that this proposal was an opening </p><p>offer and invited the GVN to make a counter offer.  The GVN </p><p>responded that they need time to examine the U.S. proposal </p><p>and noted only that the GVN would prefer to use trade </p><p>statistics from the last six months of 2002, as that was </p><p>more indicative of the growth in the sector due to the BTA. </p><p> </p><p>Visa Arrangement </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) The draft Visa Arrangement agreement tabled by the </p><p>U.S. delegation would establish a visa system to be used by </p><p>the GVN to track and manage its quota.  The U.S. side noted </p><p>that visa arrangements and customs cooperation are common </p><p>elements in U.S. textile agreements.  The GVN delegation </p><p>asked for more time to review the visa arrangement proposal </p><p>and note the ongoing cooperation between Vietnamese and U.S. </p><p>Customs.  The GVN suggested arrangements dealing with </p><p>customs procedures should be handled in the context of a </p><p>bilateral agreement on customs cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>Concluding Remarks and Next Steps </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) In concluding the negotiations, the GVN noted </p><p>repeatedly that the drafts tabled by the U.S. were </p><p>"complicated," and the GVN needed time for its specialists </p><p>to discuss all of the documents in detail, including the </p><p>quota categories and limits set forth in the draft annex B. </p><p>The U.S. delegation responded forcefully that before the </p><p>negotiations adjourn, the two sides needed to agree on dates </p><p>for the next round of negotiations and the GVN needed to </p><p>provide the U.S. with a counter offer on quota levels. </p><p>Without these two things, the U.S. would face tremendous </p><p>pressure to impose quotas unilaterally on Vietnam.  The GVN </p><p>referred to the Minister of Trade\'s proposal that the next </p><p>round take place between March 20 and April 20 (reported </p><p>septel) but said the exact date would have to be determined </p><p>after consideration of both side\'s schedules. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) On February 24, econoff met with MOT officials </p><p>from both the America\'s Desk and the Import-Export Office to </p><p>strongly reiterated the US delegation\'s request for a GVN </p><p>proposal for specific dates for the next round of </p><p>negotiations and for a counter offer on quota levels. </p><p>Econoff emphasized that the GVN needed to provide this </p><p>information by the end of the week of February 24-28.  On </p><p>February 28, MOT\'s Import-Export office proposed the week of </p><p>April 7-12 for the next round in Washington.  MOT also </p><p>informed econoff that they would not be able to provide a </p><p>counter offer on quotas at this time as they are currently </p><p>collecting comments from business community and would </p><p>provide it to the Embassy "as soon as they can." </p><p> </p><p>19.
