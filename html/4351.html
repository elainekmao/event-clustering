<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003140 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, KPKO, NI, IV </p><p>SUBJECT: DOMESTIC SECURITY CONCERNS AND BUDGET WOES </p><p>PRECLUDE GON CONTRIBUTION TO COTE D\'IVOIRE FORCE </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) During a November 15 meeting, Ambassador Jeter and </p><p>Minister of State for Defense (Army) Malam Lawal Batagarawa </p><p>discussed possible deployment of Nigerian forces in the </p><p>ECOWAS monitoring force for Cote d\'Ivoire.  Citing </p><p>Nigeria\'s role in peacekeeping operations in Sierra Leone </p><p>and Liberia, Ambassador Jeter emphasized that Nigerian </p><p>participation could be important to the ultimate success of </p><p>the operation, particularly if large-scale fighting were </p><p>renewed.  While Batagarawa said the GON was committed to </p><p>doing what was "best for the subregion", he was not </p><p>sanguine about Nigerian participation in the ECOWAS </p><p>observer force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Batagarawa thought the GON could not afford to </p><p>deploy many soldiers outside of Nigeria while the present </p><p>need for domestic security remained high.  Recalling recent </p><p>violence in Plateau state, he said the "killing would have </p><p>been unbelievable" had the military been unable to </p><p>intervene.  In the absence of an effective police force, </p><p>Batagarawa saw the military as the final guarantor of </p><p>order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Noting the GON\'s large budgetary shortfall for this </p><p>fiscal year (estimated at USD 2 billion), Batagarawa said </p><p>Nigeria could ill afford to get involved in an open-ended </p><p>commitment in Cote d\'Ivoire.  When told the USG commitment </p><p>of USD 3 million would cover support costs of troops on the </p><p>ground for six months, Batagarawa said the GON needed a </p><p>commitment of at least a year\'s worth of on the ground </p><p>logistics support, even to consider participating in the </p><p>operation.  Also, Batagarawa dismissed European offers of </p><p>assistance, saying the Europeans always "promise heaven and </p><p>earth" but never come through.  Despite his misgivings, </p><p>Batagarawa asked for a memorandum of the USG offer of </p><p>assistance to ECOWAS.  ODC Chief told him one would be </p><p>forwarded.  Batagarawa promised to contact the Ambassador </p><p>regarding the matter next week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: Given Nigeria\'s domestic concerns and </p><p>tension in the Bakassi, Batagarawa is probably correct that </p><p>there is not much appetite for GON participation in the </p><p>Ivoirian deployment.  Political considerations are very </p><p>important now, given the approach of election season. </p><p>Deployment in another peacekeeping operation would not be </p><p>politically popular, and President Obasanjo\'s critics could </p><p>excoriate him for sending troops to Cote d\'Ivoire. </p><p>Batagarawa\'s offer to review a memorandum of USG support </p><p>may have left the door ajar slightly, but his gesture was </p><p>probably the result of his intention to sow uncertainty </p><p>and, at least at this meeting, to avoid a direct refusal. </p><p>Getting the GON to revise its position will require much </p><p>more work and the offer of significant additional, long- </p><p>term assistance.  Unfortunately, for the time being, </p><p>domestic political, security and budgetary considerations </p><p>will make Nigeria focus on its internal condition and less </p><p>on its usual role as the fulcrum of West African </p><p>peacekeeping and conflict resolution efforts.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
