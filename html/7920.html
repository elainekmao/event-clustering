(SBU) On April 29, poloff delivered reftel points and </p><p>non-paper to Ayman Aamiri, Deputy Director of the MFA\'s IO </p><p>department, asking for Jordan\'s support in the deletion of </p><p>article 30 of the FCTC as a limited amendment before final </p><p>adoption at the upcoming World Health Assembly.  On the same </p><p>day, econoff delivered the same material to Jordan\'s Ministry </p><p>of Health.  As of May 8, the MFA told us that Jordan was </p><p>still studying the materials and had not made a decision. </p><p>Dr. Khalid Takhaineh of the MFA\'s IO Department commented </p><p>that Jordan "would try to support the U.S. position" but </p><p>noted that "what you are requesting is very difficult as it </p><p>goes against the whole trend of international agreements </p><p>since 1995."  Poloff reiterated the importance of this issue </p><p>to the USG, and again pointed to the precedent found in other </p><p>framework conventions where the approach taken on </p><p>reservations is silence.  Dr. Takheineh promised to contact </p><p>us again when the GOJ makes a decision. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
