(SBU) SUMMARY: WORLD BANK AND IMF REPRESENTATIVES IN </p><p>HANOI CONFIRM VIETNAM HAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED PRIOR </p><p>ACTIONS/CONDITIONS NECESSARY TO PERMIT THE FUND\'S PROPOSED </p><p>POVERTY REDUCTION AND GROWTH FACILITY (PRDF) AND THE BANK\'S </p><p>POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT (PRSC) FOR VIETNAM TO BE </p><p>SUBMITTED TO RESPECTIVE BOARDS FOR APPROVAL.  IF APPROVED, </p><p>VIETNAM COULD DRAW AS MUCH AS USD 800 MILLION OVER THE NEXT </p><p>THREE YEARS UNDER THESE PROGRAMS.  WE UNDERSTAND THE IMF AND </p><p>WORLD BANK BOARDS ARE TARGETING APRIL 6 AND MAY 3, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY, TO CONSIDER THE PRDF AND THE PRSC.  DONORS, AS </p><p>WELL AS BUSINESS PEOPLE AND BANKERS, ARE THRILLED THE IMF </p><p>AND WORLD BANK HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THEIR MARATHON NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>ON A NEW STRUCTURAL PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY CONT\'D: AS WE HAVE STRESSED IN REFTELS, </p><p>EMBASSY FULLY SUPPORTS THESE MUCH-NEEDED REFORMS.  WE THINK </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT FOR THEM BY THE IMF AND WORLD BANK BOARDS </p><p>WILL STRENGTHEN THE REFORM ELEMENT IN THE VIETNAM </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  MOREOVER, IF THE STRUCTURAL PROGRAM CAN BE PUT </p><p>IN PLACE IN TANDEM WITH U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT (BTA) RATIFICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION, WE COULD </p><p>WITNESS A RESURGENCE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE YEARS AHEAD, </p><p>SIMILAR TO WHAT VIETNAM EXPERIENCED IN THE EARLY TO MID- </p><p>NINETIES.  WE UNDERSTAND WASHINGTON AGENCIES ARE REVIEWING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00686  01 OF 03  231051Z </p><p>THE APPLICABILITY OF THE 1983 GRAMM AMENDMENT TO THE </p><p>PROPOSED PRGF WHICH MAY, DEPENDING ON INTERPRETATION, LIMIT </p><p>THE ADMINISTRATION\'S ABILITY TO ENDORSE THE PRGF AT THE IMF </p><p>BOARD MEETING.  WE URGE WASHINGTON AGENCIES TO TAKE WHATEVER </p><p>STEPS ARE POSSIBLE TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE PRSC AND THE PRGF </p><p>WITHOUT, HOWEVER, SEEKING A DELAY IN BOARD CONSIDERATION OF </p><p>EITHER.  FINALLY, IN ORDER TO AVOID FUTURE SIMILAR </p><p>COMPLICATIONS, WE RECOMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION SEEK </p><p>ELIMINATION OF THE GRAMM AMENDMENT AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>THE PROGRAM </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) WHILE WE HAVE YET TO SEE THE DETAILS OF THE </p><p>PROPOSED PRGF AND PRSC, WE HAVE MET OFTEN AND AT LENGTH WITH </p><p>BOTH IMF AND WORLD BANK ECONOMISTS TO DISCUSS THE `IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE\' AGREEMENTS.  THE AGREEMENTS CALL FOR A MAJOR </p><p>REFORM UNDERTAKING INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING BASIC ELEMENTS: </p><p> </p><p>A) BANKING REFORM: RESTRUCTURING THE STATE-OWNED COMMERCIAL </p><p>BANKS (SOCB\'S) AND THE JOINT STOCK BANKS (JSB\'S), WHILE </p><p>ADDRESSING THE STOCK OF NON-PERFORMING LOANS AND IMPROVING </p><p>INTERNAL PROCESSES FOR BETTER MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. </p><p>SOCB\'S WILL BE RE-CAPITALIZED AND BALANCE SHEETS CLEANED OF </p><p>BAD LOANS GRADUALLY AS THEY MEET PERFORMANCE TARGETS. </p><p>CRITICALLY IMPORTANT, THERE WILL ALSO BE A PHASE-OUT OF </p><p>POLICY LENDING BY SOCB\'S.  THE PROGRAM ALSO PLANS TO IMPROVE </p><p>THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORK AND LEVEL </p><p>THE PLAYING FIELD FOR BANKING SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00686  01 OF 03  231051Z </p><p>B) STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE (SOE) REFORM: THE SOE REFORM PLAN </p><p>CONTEMPLATES EQUITIZATION, DIVESTITURE AND LIQUIDATION OF </p><p>1800 SOE\'S OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.  THOSE SOE\'S REMAINING </p><p>GOVERNMENT-OWNED WILL BE SUBJECT TO DIAGNOSTIC AUDITS, </p><p>RESTRUCTURING, AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WILL ESTABLISH A FUND SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF FINANCING </p><p>SEVERANCE PAYMENTS TO SUPPORT WORKERS MADE REDUNDANT BY SOE </p><p>CLOSINGS OR RESTRUCTURING. </p><p> </p><p>C) TRADE REFORM: RELATES IN LARGE PART TO REMOVAL OF </p><p>QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS IN PHASES ON A MULTILATERAL BASIS, </p><p>BY EARLY 2003 AT THE LATEST, FOR CEMENT, STEEL, GLASS, </p><p>PAPER, VEGETABLE OIL, CERAMIC AND GRANITE TILES, AND </p><p>FERTILIZER.  THE PROGRAM WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE GVN TO </p><p>FOLLOW THROUGH WITH COMMITMENTS MADE IN AFTA AND THE U.S.- </p><p>VIETNAM BTA. </p><p> </p><p>THE PRGF AND THE PRSC WILL ALSO INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS </p><p>RELATING TO PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND PRIVATE SECTOR REFORM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRIOR ACTIONS COMPLETE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS, EMBASSY OFFICERS AND </p><p>USAID COUNTRY MANAGER HAVE MAINTAINED CLOSE COORDINATION </p><p>WITH LOCAL IMF AND WORLD BANK REPRESENTATIVES AS THEY HAVE </p><p>WORKED WITH THE GVN TO `CLOSE\' THE PRIOR ACTIONS/CONDITIONS </p><p>TO THE PRGF AND PRSC TO PERMIT CONSIDERATION OF THIS </p><p>IMPRESSIVE REFORM AGENDA TO TAKE PLACE AT IMF AND WORLD BANK </p><p>HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON.  USAID, IN PARTICULAR, HAS SHOWN </p><p>EXEMPLARY LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE DONOR COMMUNITY BY PROPOSING </p><p>TO UNDERWRITE A DIAGNOSTIC AUDIT OF ONE OF VIETNAM\'S FOUR </p><p>STATE-OWNED COMMERCIAL BANKS USING INTERNATIONALLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED AUDITING STANDARDS.  AS OF MARCH 23, WE </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE GVN HAS COMPLETED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRIOR </p><p>ACTIONS/CONDITIONS.  WE SAY SUBSTANTIALLY BECAUSE IMF AND </p><p>WORLD BANK EXPERTS CONTINUE TO STUDY GVN SUBMISSIONS.  STATE </p><p>BANK OF VIETNAM GOVERNOR LE DUC THUY HAS SIGNED A LETTER TO </p><p>THE IMF ACKNOWLEDGING VIETNAM\'S LIST OF COMMITMENTS UNDER </p><p>THE PROPOSED STRUCTURAL PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>UNIQUE ALIGNMENT OF THE PLANETS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) IT IS EMBASSY\'S VIEW THAT VIETNAM IS UNIQUELY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00686  02 OF 03  231051Z </p><p>STAGED TO UNDERGO A DRAMATIC POTENTIAL REFORM EFFORT WHICH </p><p>COULD TRANSFORM THE WAY THE COUNTRY DOES BUSINESS OVER THE </p><p>NEXT DECADE.  ESSENTIALLY THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THIS REFORM </p><p>EFFORT: ONE, THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND SOE RESTRUCTURING; AND </p><p>TWO, THE TRADE COMMITMENTS VIETNAM HAS AGREED TO, INCLUDING </p><p>THOSE CONTAINED IN AFTA AND ONES IN THE YET-TO-BE RATIFIED </p><p>U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA).  IN ESSENCE, </p><p>THE BTA\'S IMPLEMENTATION WILL FORCE VIETNAM TO RESTRUCTURE </p><p>RADICALLY ITS TRADE REGIME.  AT THE SAME TIME, AS A RESULT </p><p>OF THE NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS STATUS IT WILL BRING TO </p><p>VIETNAM\'S GOODS IN THE U.S. MARKET, IT WILL PROVIDE A </p><p>STIMULUS TO MAKE THE STRUCTURAL REFORMS WORK.  WHILE THE IMF </p><p>AND WORLD BANK FUNDING WILL HELP VIETNAM MEET ITS GROWTH </p><p>NEEDS AS IT RESTRUCTURES, THE ACCESS TO THE U.S. MARKET WILL </p><p>SERVE TO ATTRACT FURTHER MARGINAL INVESTMENT IN DOMESTIC </p><p>PRODUCTION AND ATTRACT ADDITIONAL FOREIGN DIRECT CAPITAL. </p><p>CONSEQUENTLY, WE THINK WASHINGTON AGENCIES AND OTHER DONORS </p><p>SHOULD FULLY SUPPORT THE IMF AND WORLD BANK PROGRAMS. </p><p>RARELY DO OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS PRESENT THEMSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>GRAMM AMENDMENT </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) EMBASSY WAS DISMAYED TO LEARN THIS WEEK OF THE </p><p>GRAMM AMENDMENT, A STATUTE ENACTED DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE </p><p>COLD WAR, WHICH IMPOSES A REQUIREMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION </p><p>TO REPORT TO THE CONGRESS WELL IN ADVANCE WHEN IT PLANS TO </p><p>VOTE FAVORABLY FOR AN IMF STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT. </p><p>WHILE WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT POSITION WASHINGTON AGENCIES PLAN </p><p>TO TAKE ON THE IMF PORTION OF THE STRUCTURAL PROGRAM, WE </p><p>WOULD HOPE THAT IF WASHINGTON AGENCIES ARE FAVORABLY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00686  02 OF 03  231051Z </p><p>DISPOSED TO IT THEY COULD FIND A WAY TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE IMF PROGRAM.  IF, HOWEVER, THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION </p><p>WOULD NOT ALLOW THIS, WE WOULD URGE QUIET ABSTENTION IN THIS </p><p>UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE.  WE DO NOT COUNSEL A REQUEST FOR </p><p>POSTPONEMENT OF THE VOTING AT THE IMF BOARD MEETING.  WE </p><p>THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE BROAD DONOR SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>PACKAGE AND WE WOULD RATHER THAT THE PROGRAM BE APPROVED </p><p>EARLY THAN TO STAND THE RISK OF DELAY.  WE WOULD HOPE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT WHEN THE SUBSEQUENT WORLD BANK PROGRAM IS </p><p>CONSIDERED IN EARLY MAY THAT THE U.S. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR </p><p>COULD PREPARE A STRONG ENDORSEMENT OF THE PROGRAM AS A </p><p>WHOLE.  WE NOTE THE GRAMM AMENDMENT WOULD NOT APPLY. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) WE URGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE STOCK OF THE </p><p>GRAMM AMENDMENT AND LIKE STATUTES WHICH REMAIN, WITH A VIEW </p><p>TO THEIR REMOVAL.  THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE ENACTED </p><p>DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR AND THE DEPARTMENT EARLY </p><p>ON SOUGHT TO REMOVE THESE PROHIBITIONS FROM OUR AID AND </p><p>OTHER AGENCY ACTIVITIES AS A RESULT OF NORMALIZED RELATIONS. </p><p>IN SHORT, THESE PROVISIONS NOT ONLY NO LONGER SERVE A USEFUL </p><p>PURPOSE, BUT THEY ALSO CAN SERVE AS IRRITANTS IN THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  WHILE LAWYERS MAY DEBATE WHETHER VIETNAM IS A </p><p>`COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP\' FOR PURPOSES OF THE STATUTE, </p><p>ECONOMISTS SEE VIETNAM AS A COUNTRY IN TRANSITION FROM A </p><p>SOCIALIST TO A MORE MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) WE APPRECIATE THAT WASHINGTON AGENCIES HAVE NOT </p><p>HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE IMF AND WORLD BANK PAPERS </p><p>REGARDING THE PRGF AND PRSC FOR VIETNAM.  NEITHER HAVE WE. </p><p>HOWEVER, FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT, THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR A </p><p>MAJOR RESTRUCTURING EFFORT OVERSEEN BY THE IMF AND WORLD </p><p>BANK.  WE HAVE COMPARED NOTES WITH THE IMF AND WORLD BANK AS </p><p>THEY HAVE NEGOTIATED THIS VERY DIFFICULT PROGRAM OVER THE </p><p>LAST FIVE YEARS, ESPECIALLY THE LAST FEW MONTHS.  THEY ARE </p><p>PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS.  WHILE THEY RECOGNIZE THE PROGRAM </p><p>IS THE START OF A LONG PROCESS, THEY ARE CONFIDENT THAT IT </p><p>IS ONE WHICH THE VIETNAMESE CAN ACHIEVE AND WILL BRING ABOUT </p><p>SIGNIFICANT, DEMONSTRABLE RESULTS.  WE, AS WELL, ARE QUITE </p><p>EXCITED BY THE PROSPECTS FOR CHANGE WHICH THE STRUCTURAL </p><p>PROGRAM, TOGETHER WITH THE U.S.-VIETNAM BTA, CAN CREATE IN </p><p>VIETNAM, AN EMERGING ECONOMY OF 80 MILLION PEOPLE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00686  03 OF 03  231051Z </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
