<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 001068 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR/SE, AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUADRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW STUDIES HIGHLIGHT FRAGILE RECOVERY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.  Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Summary:  Two new national surveys of Turkish </p><p>companies highlight signs of recovery from the devastating </p><p>financial crisis of 2001.  The studies, carried out </p><p>separately by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO) and the </p><p>Islamic-influenced Independent Industrialists\' and </p><p>Businessmen\'s Association (MUSIAD), show a modest recovery, </p><p>led largely by growth in exports.  ISO Chairman Tanil Kucuk </p><p>stressed in announcing his organization\'s survey of the </p><p>country\'s top 500 industrial companies that Turkey has </p><p>benefited from booming exports but has much work to do to </p><p>achieve "sustainable" economic growth. Though the study </p><p>showed that Turkish industry returned to profitability in </p><p>2002, he warned that recent headline growth figures in GNP </p><p>(at 7.8 percent for 2002 and 8.1 percent in this year\'s first </p><p>quarter) exaggerate the economy\'s strength and are "too good </p><p>to be true."  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Turkey\'s Industrial 500 </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Return to Profitability: The annual ISO study provides </p><p>an authoritative snapshot of Turkish industry.  Overall, the </p><p>industrial sector\'s share in GNP increased to 25.6 percent in </p><p>2002 from 23 percent the previous two years, with the top 500 </p><p>companies accounting for 53.9 percent of that total (13.2 </p><p>percent of GNP).  Sales of the top 500 companies grew 5.8 </p><p>percent in real terms over 2001, with four-fifths of the </p><p>companies registering a profit for the year, for an overall </p><p>profit level of 5.7 percent (versus a 0.5 percent loss for </p><p>the 500 companies in 2001).  Sales and profits were largely </p><p>export driven, with the 500 achieving a 17.3 percent increase </p><p>in exports, for a total of 17.3 billion USD, 49.5 percent of </p><p>the country\'s total exports.  Other key factors in increasing </p><p>profitability were decreasing labor costs (which took only 27 </p><p>percent of sales revenue in 2002, versus 34 percent in 2001), </p><p>lower interest rates, and decreasing rent.  While the ratio </p><p>of "other revenues" (interest earnings, real estate sales, </p><p>and earnings from foreign currency exchange) over earnings </p><p>from core operational activities was 114 percent in 2002 (it </p><p>has been over 100 percent since 1999), it declined </p><p>significantly from its level of 547 percent in 2001.  The </p><p>decline reflects a significant shift by firms back towards </p><p>their core activities, a trend that should be reinforced in </p><p>coming years if real interest rates and inflation continue to </p><p>decline. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Public vs. Private: The survey also provides a useful </p><p>breakdown of state ownership in the industrial sector.  While </p><p>Turkey\'s two largest industrial concerns, the state refinery </p><p>Tupras (slated for privatization this year) and Electricity </p><p>Production Ltd. (EUAS) are state-owned (with sales quadruple </p><p>and double the next largest companies, respectively), overall </p><p>only 30 of the top 500 companies are in the state\'s hands. </p><p>While private sector exports boomed in 2002, public sector </p><p>industrial exports dropped from 1.2 billion USD to 972 </p><p>million USD.  Employment figures show that the IMF program is </p><p>having an effect: the three largest employers on the list </p><p>(TEKEL, Turkish Sugar Factories, and the Turkish Coal Mining </p><p>Companies) are state owned, but overall employment in public </p><p>sector companies fell 21.86 percent from 178,005 to 139,102. </p><p>Private sector industrial employment rose 5 percent to </p><p>365,694.  The increased efficiencies resulting from the cuts </p><p>brought an impressive turnaround in profitability for public </p><p>sector companies, from negative 6.1 percent to plus 8.3 </p><p>percent.  Private companies also saw increasing </p><p>profitability, though the rise was more modest, with </p><p>profitability reaching 5.1 percent in 2002 from 1.3 percent </p><p>in 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Winners: Koc Holding remains Turkey\'s largest private </p><p>industrial group, with 19 companies in the top 500, and five </p><p>in the top 10 private companies.  Koc leads in all areas, </p><p>including total sales, profits, exports, and employment. </p><p>With group sales of 4.85 billion USD, the holding accounted </p><p>for 9 percent of total sales and 11 percent of total private </p><p>sector sales among the top 500.  The country\'s second largest </p><p>holding, the Sabanci group, has 15 companies in the top 500, </p><p>but in a reflection of its increasing orientation towards </p><p>financial services, has no companies in the top 10 private </p><p>companies for either overall sales, exports, or profits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Words of Warning: In his public comments announcing </p><p>the survey results, ISO President Tanil Kucuk noted that </p><p>conditions are generally improving, but stressed that </p><p>headline growth figures (7.8 percent in 2002 and 8.1 percent </p><p>in this year\'s first quarter) are "too good to be true," and </p><p>will not be sustainable until fundamental changes occur in </p><p>the economy.  He echoed points he has made frequently to us </p><p>in recent meetings about the difficulties facing Turkish </p><p>companies, including the unavailability of affordable credit, </p><p>which requires companies to finance investments from their </p><p>own resources, the high cost of energy and other inputs, and </p><p>high tax and social security payments on wages, including </p><p>particularly the increasing weight of indirect taxes (which </p><p>now account for 70 percent of all tax revenues).  Action is </p><p>needed, he stressed, to expand Turkey\'s tax base and thereby </p><p>reduce the size of the shadow economy and the unfair </p><p>competition it represesents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>MUSIAD Survey </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Improving Morale: The MUSIAD survey, carried out in 27 </p><p>provinces with participation by 1800 companies, showed a </p><p>similar improvement in morale, while also highlighting the </p><p>challenges on the horizon.   50 percent of the companies </p><p>surveyed increased production in the first half of 2003, 54 </p><p>percent experienced an increase in domestic sales, 58 percent </p><p>saw an increase in exports, and 45 percent increased their </p><p>workforce.  Profitability presented a more mixed picture, </p><p>however, with 36 percent seeing increased profits, 29 percent </p><p>seeing no change, and 35 percent suffering a drop in </p><p>profitability.  Expectations for the second half of the year </p><p>were more positive, with predictions for increases outpacing </p><p>first half results for sales (61 percent), exports (76 </p><p>percent) and employment (57 percent).  One-third of </p><p>respondents noted that they operate at 70-80 percent of </p><p>capacity, with 22 percent utilizing 60-70 percent, and </p><p>another 22 percent utilizing less than half. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Continuing Challenges: The MUSIAD survey highlights </p><p>the fact that even small companies are heavily dependent on </p><p>exports, with 58 percent of respondents exporting 61-80 </p><p>percent of their production, and 9 percent exporting </p><p>virtually everything they produce.  Exports continue despite </p><p>the appreciating Turkish lira, but many respondents warned </p><p>that the profit margin on exports is becoming dangerously </p><p>low.  The survey also highlighted the continuing financing </p><p>problems facing Turkish industry, with general reluctance </p><p>(and inability) to use outside funding sources forcing </p><p>two-third\'s of respondents to utilize their own equity to </p><p>continue their operations.  Only 21 percent utilized bank </p><p>loans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) MUSIAD Chairman Ali Bayramoglu suggested that </p><p>increasing growth and declining inflation show that the </p><p>wounds of 2001 are gradually healing.  He argued that </p><p>business confidence in the government is increasing, but </p><p>pressed for action to reduce the domestic borrowing </p><p>requirement of the government and to bring Turkey\'s widening </p><p>current account deficit under control.  If action is not </p><p>speedily taken on these issues, he warned, including through </p><p>a "controlled flexible currency policy," Turkey faces a </p><p>possible crisis in the fall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Comment: The MUSIAD and ISO studies confirm what we </p><p>are hearing anecdotally from other contacts here in Istanbul: </p><p>the real economy has improved over the past year and a half, </p><p>but remains fragile, and sensitive to macroeconomic shocks. </p><p>Most concur that headline growth figures exaggerate the </p><p>extent of improvement in the economy, and that the important </p><p>motor of domestic demand has only improved marginally over </p><p>the past year.  Given the critical problem of financing, </p><p>which hampers almost all Turkish companies, most business </p><p>groups remain strong backers of Turkey\'s economic reform </p><p>program, hoping that by reducing inflation and changing the </p><p>country\'s risk profile real interest rates can be brought to </p><p>a more business-friendly level.  MUSIAD, long a strong critic </p><p>of the program, remains the only significant exception to </p><p>that rule.  End Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
