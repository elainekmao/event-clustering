(C) THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE IS VERY ENCOURAGED BY </p><p>THE RESULTS OF THE SUMMIT HELD AMONG THE LUSAKA </p><p>SIGNATORIES IN LUSAKA ON FEBRUARY 15 (REFTEL).  BERNARD </p><p>TAKAVARASHA, THE UNDERSECRETARY FOR AFRICA IN ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>MFA, TOLD POLOFF FEBRUARY 16 THAT THE SUMMIT OUTCOME WAS </p><p>"VERY POSITIVE" AND "BETTER THAN EXPECTED."  TAKAVARASHA </p><p>STATED THE MOST IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT WAS THAT THE </p><p>"PEOPLE OF THE CONGO" (GOVERNMENT AND REBEL FACTIONS) </p><p>HAD AGREED TO START THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE. </p><p>ZIMBABWE VIEWS THE DIALOGUE AS CRITICAL TO ANY </p><p>MEANINGFUL PEACE SETTLEMENT IN DRC, THE MFA OFFICIAL </p><p>NOTED.  ONCE STARTED, THE DIALOGUE COULD SIDELINE THE </p><p>EXTERNAL STATE ACTORS, AND RIGHTFULLY SO, TAKAVARASHA </p><p>STATED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT OF RWANDA\'S </p><p>FAILURE TO SEND A REPRESENTATIVE TO THE SUMMIT, THE </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY SAID IT WAS REGRETTABLE, BUT HE DID NOT </p><p>DWELL ON IT.  HE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT MUSEVENI DID NOT </p><p>ATTEND EITHER, BUT THAT HE HAD SENT REPRESENTATIVES WHO </p><p>OFFERED APOLOGIES FOR THE UGANDAN PRESIDENT\'S ABSENCE. </p><p>POLOFF ASKED TAKAVARASHA TO COMMENT ON PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE\'S STATEMENT THAT ZIMBABWE WOULD WITHDRAW ITS </p><p>FORCES ONLY AFTER UGANDA AND RWANDA DID, TO WHICH HE </p><p>RESPONDED THAT THAT HAS BEEN ZIMBABWE\'S POSITION ALL </p><p>ALONG.  THE MFA OFFICIAL JOKINGLY REMARKED THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p>IS TOO POOR TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT BASES IN THE DRC AS </p><p>THE MUCH WEALTHIER U.S. HAS DONE AROUND THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00762  161016Z </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: THE ZIMBABWEAN MFA OFFICIAL SEEMED </p><p>GENUINELY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS OF THE LUSAKA SUMMIT, </p><p>ALMOST TO THE POINT OF GIDDINESS, WHICH IS NOT AN MFA </p><p>TRAIT.  THE MFA\'S COMMENTS UNDERSCORE ZIMBABWE\'S DESIRE </p><p>FOR THE RAPID IMPLEMENTATION OF PEACE IN THE DRC SO THAT </p><p>IT CAN BRING HOME AT LEAST SOME OF ITS TROOPS BEFORE </p><p>NEXT YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
