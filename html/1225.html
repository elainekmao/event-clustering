<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 004057 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (PATIN, ROBERTSON, HOWARD) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, ZI, KPAO </p><p>SUBJECT: PUBLIC DIPLOMACY AND THE EVOLUTION OF ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>DEMOCRACY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  THE WIN OF 57 PARLIAMENTARY SEATS BY THE </p><p>    MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) IN THE JUNE, 2000 </p><p>    ELECTIONS MARKS AN IMPORTANT NEW STAGE IN THE EVOLUTION </p><p>    OF ZIMBABWEAN DEMOCRACY. AFTER 20 YEARS AS A ONE-PARTY </p><p>    STATE, THE RULING ZIMBABWE AFRICAN NATIONAL UNION - </p><p>    PATRIOTIC FRONT (ZANU-PF) PARTY WILL NOW NEED TO </p><p>    COMPETE WITH A MEANINGFUL OPPOSITION IN THE PARLIAMENT. </p><p>    WHILE ZANU-PF STILL CONTROLS A PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY, </p><p>    AND WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO PASS THE LEGISLATION IT </p><p>    DESIRES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>    AMENDMENTS -- THOSE REQUIRE A TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY) IT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04057  01 OF 03  241243Z </p><p>    MUST NOW COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS AND </p><p>    IDEOLOGIES WITH A NEW GENERATION OF POLITICAL THOUGHT. </p><p>    THE BIRTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF A VIABLE OPPOSITION IN </p><p>    ZIMBABWE WAS A COMPLEX AND LENGTHY PROCESS, AND OWES </p><p>    ITS SUCCESS TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE.  IT </p><p>    IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, TO RELATE U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLIC </p><p>    DIPLOMACY PROGRAMS TO THE GROWTH OF A POLITICAL </p><p>    ENVIRONMENT AMENABLE TO DEMOCRATIC PLURALISM IN </p><p>    ZIMBABWE.  THIS REPORT ATTEMPTS TO OUTLINE HOW USG </p><p>    PUBLIC DIPLOMACY PROGRAMS IN ZIMBABWE HELPED TO CREATE </p><p>    SOME OF THE CONDITIONS THAT LED TO BROADER PUBLIC </p><p>    INVOLVEMENT IN THE NATION\'S POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT.  END </p><p>    SUMMARY. </p><p>    ZIMBABWE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THAT CLAIM.  WE CAN, </p><p>    HOWEVER, TAKE CREDIT FOR HAVING PROVIDED THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>    ZIMBABWE WITH IDEAS, EXAMPLES AND SKILLS WHICH </p><p>    STRENGTHENED THEIR OWN EXPRESSIONS OF SELF- </p><p>    DETERMINATION.  OUR PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN NON-PARTISAN, </p><p>    PROVIDING INFORMATION AND AMERICAN EXPERIENCES TO </p><p>    MEMBERS OF THE RULING PARTY AS WELL AS TO PEOPLE WHO </p><p>    HAVE BECOME LEADERS IN THE OPPOSITION AND IN CIVIL </p><p>    SOCIETY.  THE NON-PARTISAN NATURE OF OUR PROGRAMS </p><p>    UNDERSCORES THE NOTION THAT ONLY THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>    CAN CLAIM CREDIT FOR POLITICAL PROGRESS IN THEIR </p><p>    COUNTRY.  IT ALSO SUPPORTS THE NOTION THAT IDEAS AND </p><p>    INFORMATION, OUR BASIC COMMODITIES, BREED POLITICAL </p><p>    DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE 20 YEARS SINCE ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENCE, A BROAD </p><p>    ARRAY OF PUBLIC DIPLOMACY PROGRAMS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO </p><p>    THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRACY.  THE FOLLOWING IS A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04057  01 OF 03  241243Z </p><p>    PARTIAL LISTING OF PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY </p><p>    PRODUCTIVE.  WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT AF/PD ALSO ASK </p><p>    FORMER USIS OFFICERS WHO HAVE WORKED IN ZIMBABWE FOR </p><p>    ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC </p><p>    DIPLOMACY PROGRAMS HERE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE MAY 2000 EMINENT PERSONS IN CONSULTATION (EPIC) </p><p>    PROGRAM -- THIS PROGRAM LED DIRECTLY TO THE PRODUCTION </p><p>    OF CRITICAL VOTER EDUCATION MATERIAL IMMEDIATELY BEFORE </p><p>    ZIMBABWE\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  THIS AMBASSADORIAL </p><p>    INITIATIVE WAS FUNDED BY USAID/ZIMBABWE AND MANAGED BY </p><p>    THE EMBASSY\'S PUBLIC AFFAIRS SECTION.  DURING ONE OF </p><p>    THE PROGRAM\'S WORKSHOPS, A FLIER TO EDUCATE ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>    VOTERS ABOUT THE SECRECY OF THE BALLOT WAS CONCEIVED </p><p>    AND DESIGNED.  WITHIN TWO WEEKS, THE LEGAL RESOURCES </p><p>    FOUNDATION, A LEADING ZIMBABWEAN NGO, HAD PRODUCED ONE </p><p>    MILLION COPIES OF THE FLIER.  IT WAS USED AS AN INSERT </p><p>    IN ALL OF THE NATION\'S NEWSPAPERS AND GIVEN AWAY AT </p><p>    SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  SECRECY OF THE BALLOT </p><p>    WAS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR MANY VOTERS IN ZIMBABWE AND THE </p><p>    TIMELY PRODUCTION OF THE FLIER WAS AN IMPORTANT MEANS </p><p>    OF HELPING TO PROMOTE THE FREEST, FAIREST POSSIBLE </p><p>    ELECTIONS. </p><p>5.  CIVITAS PROGRAMS BETWEEN 1997 AND 1999 -- THE MOST </p><p>    CONCRETE RESULT OF ZIMBABWEAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>    CIVITAS INITIATIVE WAS THE DEVELOPMENT AND INCLUSION OF </p><p>    CIVIC EDUCATION MATERIALS IN SECONDARY SCHOOL </p><p>    CURRICULA.  MR. CONRAD KUONA, ONE OF </p><p>THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>    PARTICIPANTS IN THE MAY 1997 CIVITAS CONFERENCE IN </p><p>    PRETORIA, WAS NAMED TO THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04057  01 OF 03  241243Z </p><p>    COMMISSION ON EDUCATION.  USING THIS POSITION, </p><p>    MATERIALS AND WISDOM GAINED THROUGH THE CIVITAS </p><p>    PROGRAM, AND CONTINUED POST SUPPORT (INCLUDING AN </p><p>    ACADEMIC SPECIALIST), MR. KUONA INTEGRATED CIVIC </p><p>    EDUCATION MATERIAL INTO THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM.  AS A </p><p>    DIRECT RESULT OF THE CIVITAS PROGRAM, SECONDARY SCHOOL </p><p>    STUDENTS THROUGHOUT ZIMBABWE NOW RECEIVE INSTRUCTION ON </p><p>    CITIZENS\' BASIC CIVIC RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE CIVITAS PROGRAM, IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN USIS- </p><p>    ADMINISTERED GRANT FROM USAID, RESULTED IN THE 1998 </p><p>    CREATION OF A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH PROGRAM IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p>    THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY THE PUBLICATION IN 1999 OF A BOOK </p><p>    ON WHY AND HOW TO ORGANIZE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE, BUT AVOWED BY ONE ZIMABWEAN </p><p>    PARTICIPANT IN THE MAY 1997 PRETORIA CIVITAS CONFRENCE, </p><p>    IS THE PROPOSITION THAT ZIMBABWE\'S CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>    REFORM BEGAN THERE.  VICTOR JUMO, THEN WITH THE </p><p>    ZIMBABWEAN NGO "THE LEGAL RESOURCES FOUNDATION," TELLS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0398 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04057  02 OF 03  241243Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AMAD-00  A-00     UTED-00  TEDE-00  IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      OIC-02   PA-00    IRM-00   IAP-00   USIE-00  R-00     IIP-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------71A7E5  241244Z /38 </p><p>R 241246Z JUL 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6674 </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 004057 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (PATIN, ROBERTSON, HOWARD) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, ZI, KPAO </p><p>SUBJECT: PUBLIC DIPLOMACY AND THE EVOLUTION OF ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>DEMOCRACY </p><p> </p><p>    US THAT ZIMBABWEAN PARTICIPANTS IN CIVITAS \'97 WERE </p><p>    INSPIRED AT THE CONFERENCE BY THEIR SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>    COUNTERPARTS\' WORK ON CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM.  UPON </p><p>    RETURNING TO ZIMBABWE, THE ZIMBABWEAN CIVITASIANS </p><p>    CONVOKED A MEETING OF OTHER NGOS.  THAT MEETING LED TO </p><p>    THE CREATION OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>    (NCA).  THE NCA\'S WORK TO PROMOTE CONSTITIONAL REFORM </p><p>    GALVANIZED PULIC OPINION, LED TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>    CREATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION, AND RESULTED </p><p>    IN A DRAFT CONSTITUTION IN LATE 1999.  POPULAR </p><p>    REJECTION OF THAT DRAFT IN THE FEBRUARY 2000 REFERENDUM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04057  02 OF 03  241243Z </p><p>    GENERATED A SENSE OF POLITICAL EMPOWERMENT AMONG </p><p>    ZIMBABWEAN VOTERS AND HELPED TO CREATE THE VOTER TURN- </p><p>    OUT AND COURAGE WHICH ELECTED AN UNPRECEDENTED </p><p>    OPPOSITION BLOCK TO PARLIAMENT IN JUNE 2000. </p><p>8.  INTERNATIONAL VISITOR GRANTS HAVE PROVIDED FIRST-TIME </p><p>    EXPOSURE TO THE U.S. FOR A NUMBER OF ZIMBABWEANS WHO </p><p>    HAVE GONE ON TO POSITIONS OF NATIONAL PROMINENCE.  THE </p><p>    LIST OF FORMER IV GRANTEES READS LIKE A WHO\'S WHO OF </p><p>    INFLUENTIAL ZIMBABWEANS.  ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE IS </p><p>    MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, THE LEADER OF THE NEWLY FORMED </p><p>    OPPOSTION PARTY, THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE </p><p>    (MDC).  TSVANGIRAI PARTICIPATED IN A 1989 MULTI- </p><p>    REGIONAL IV PROGRAM.  OF COURSE, NOT EVERY SINGLE IV </p><p>    ALUMNI HAS PROVEN TO BE A DISTINGUISHED DEFENDER OF </p><p>    DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND FREE MARKETS, BUT THE </p><p>    OVERALL LIST IS OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE.
