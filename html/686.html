A PRESS STATEMENT FROM THE </p><p>CONGRESS STATES THAT "THE FALL OF THE IRON </p><p>CURTAIN, AND THE CIS KURDS HAVING COME TO KNOW </p><p>ABOUT THE NATIONAL LIBERATION STRUGGLE OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF KURDISTAN, AND THEIR JOINING THIS </p><p>STRUGGLE, HAS OPENED UP NEW PROSPECTS FOR THE </p><p>\'SOVIET\' KURDS." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FRONT FOR THE </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION OF KURDISTAN (FNLK) ALSO </p><p>ATTENDED THE CONGRESS.  ACCORDING TO THE RUSSIAN </p><p>PRESS, THE FNLK IS LINKED TO THE PKK.

THE TURKS RAISED THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>THE CONGRESS WITH THE RUSSIAN MFA, STRESSING THE </p><p>TERRORIST NATURE OF THE PKK.  THE TURKISH EMBASSY </p><p>SAW NO EVIDENCE THAT THE GOR SUPPORTED THE PKK OR </p><p>THE CONGRESS IN ANY WAY AND FRAMED THEIR </p><p>PRESENTATION IN TERMS OF A BRIEFING ABOUT THE </p><p>BACKGROUND OF THE PKK.
