THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED DAILY "THE HERALD" PUBLISHED A </p><p>   PAGE-ONE STORY ON NOVEMBER 23 ASSERTING THAT A "DIPLOMATIC </p><p>   ROW" WAS IMMINENT BETWEEN THE US AND ZIMBABWE.  THE SUBJECT </p><p>   OF THE "ROW" IS A "LETTER" THE US SENT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>   ZIMBABWE (GOZ) IN PROTEST OF "WIDESPREAD BEATING OF WHITES </p><p>   AND OTHERS IN RETALIATION TO THE ABDUCTION, TORTURE AND </p><p>   MURDER OF NATIONAL HERO CDE CAIN NKALA."  THE ARTICLE ALSO </p><p>   SPECULATED THAT THE GOZ WOULD SUMMON AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN TO </p><p>   PROTEST THE LETTER "AS THERE WAS NO INDISCRIMINATE BEATING </p><p>   OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY." </p><p> </p><p>2.   THE ARTICLE QUOTES AN UNNAMED GOZ SPOKESMAN WHO BLAMES </p><p>   HARARE-BASED FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS FOR "FALSE AND ALARMIST </p><p>   REPORTS" AND FOR "GROSS AND OBSCENE MISREPRESENTATION OF </p><p>   FACTS" THAT LED THE US GOVERNMENT TO BELIEVE THERE WERE </p><p>   PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE.  THE ARTICLE NAMES 5 REPORTERS IN </p><p>   ZIMBABWE WHO REPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.   EXCERPTS FOLLOW:  "THE U.S. YESTERDAY SENT A LETTER OF </p><p>   PROTEST TO THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGING THAT THERE WERE </p><p>   WIDESPREAD BEATINGS OF WHITES AND OTHERS IN RETALIATION TO </p><p>   THE ABDUCTION, TORTURE AND MURDER OF NATIONAL HERO CAIN </p><p>   NKALA.  THE LETTER IS, HOWEVER, LIKELY TO TRIGGER A </p><p>   DIPLOMATIC FURORE BETWEEN HARARE AND WASHINGTON AS IT WAS </p><p>   SUSPECTED THAT THE ALLEGATIONS WERE BASED ON WIDESPREAD </p><p>   FALSE MEDIA REPORTS BY SOME HARARE-BASED OVERSEAS </p><p>   CORRESPONDENTS.  DIPLOMATIC SOURCES TOLD "THE HERALD" LAST </p><p>   NIGHT THAT HARARE COULD REACT BY SUMMONING THE U.S. </p><p>   AMBASSADOR TO ZIMBABWE JOSEPH SULLIVAN AS THERE WAS NO </p><p>   INDISCRIMINATE BEATING OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY.  THE </p><p>   DIPLOMATIC SOURCES SAID IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT THE </p><p>   AMERICANS HAD TAKEN AS AUTHENTIC, FALSE AND ALARMIST </p><p>   REPORTS BY FOREIGN MEDIA CORRESPONDENTS BASED IN HARARE. .A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03533  260646Z </p><p>   GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN COULD NOT CONFIRM OR DENY RECEIVING </p><p>   THE PROTEST LETTER FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT BUT SAID IF </p><p>   RECEIVED, IT WOULD BE DEALT WITH IN THE USUAL MANNER </p><p>   THROUGH THE DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS. </p><p> </p><p>4.   THE SPOKESMAN HOWEVER, CONFIRMED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>   WAS AWARE OF GROSS MISREPRESENTATION OF FACTS BY HARARE- </p><p>   BASED FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS.  \'WE ARE AWARE AND WE ARE </p><p>   VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROSS AND OBSCENE </p><p>   MISREPRESENTATION OF FACTS BY THE SO-CALLED FOREIGN </p><p>   CORRESPONDENTS AND IN PARTICULAR JAN RAATH (TIMES OF </p><p>   LONDON AND THE OBSERVER, LONDON), ANDREW MELDRUM (THE </p><p>   GUARDIAN, THE ECONOMIST AND THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE </p><p>   MONITOR), PETA THORNYCROFT (VOA AND THE TELEGRAPH, </p><p>   LONDON), ANGUS SHAW (ASSOCIATED PRESS), RICHARD CARVER </p><p>   (GEMINI FEATURES, MEDIA MONITORING UNIT, SOUTH AFRICA), </p><p>   AND ASSISTED BY THE LIKES OF BASILDON PETA (THE </p><p>   FINANCIAL GAZETTE, ZIMBABWE, AND THE INDEPENDENT, </p><p>   LONDON) AND DUMISANI MULEYA (THE ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT, </p><p>   ZIMBABWE AND THE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY STANDARD, SOUTH </p><p>   AFRICA).  IT IS NOW AN OPEN SECRET THAT THESE REPORTERS </p><p>   ARE NOT ONLY DISTORTING THE FACTS BUT ARE ASSISTING </p><p>   TERRORISTS WHO STAND ACCUSED IN OUR COURTS OF LAW OF </p><p>   ABDUCTION, TORTURE AND MURDER BY COVERING UP AND </p><p>   MISREPRESENTING THE BRUTAL DEEDS OF THE TERRORISTS.\' </p><p>   THE SPOKESMAN SAID IF IT WAS TRUE THAT THE AMERICANS HAD </p><p>   SENT A LETTER OF PROTEST \'THEN THAT IS MOST UNFORTUNATE </p><p>   BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN EMBASSY HERE AND AN AMBASSADOR AND </p><p>   ARE THEREFORE IN A POSITION TO KNOW FIRST HAND THAT MDC </p><p>   (MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE) TERRORISTS HAVE </p><p>   ABDUCTED, TORTURED AND MURDERED THEIR PERCEIVED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03533  260646Z </p><p>   POLITICAL OPPONENTS.\'  THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE U.S. </p><p>   EMBASSY HAD NO REASON OR EXCUSE TO RELY ON THE FALSE </p><p>   REPORTS BY CORRESPONDENTS.  \' </p><p></p></div>
