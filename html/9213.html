<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001172 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EPET, ENRG, PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, CASC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: STRIKE ENTERS SECOND WEEK </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1168 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The labor strike entered its second week </p><p>today, as the GON and NLC failed to reach a compromise on the </p><p>extent of the fuel price increase.  Information from labor </p><p>sources was conflicting, with some insiders forecasting an </p><p>imminent settlement and others predicting an extended strike. </p><p> With President Obasanjo traveling to Mozambique tomorrow for </p><p>the African Union (AU) Summit, the strike may drag on if a </p><p>settlement is not reached before he departs.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Muddling Through </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Abuja was quiet and traffic was light as many workers </p><p>continued to stay home. In Lagos, sporadic gun fire was heard </p><p>and burning tires obstructed many roads this morning.  The </p><p>NLC issued a statement this afternoon claiming the police </p><p>killed at least 10 people in Lagos today.  Embassy sources </p><p>throughout the country confirmed that banks, markets, and </p><p>government offices were mostly closed.  Security presence, </p><p>both police and military, remained heavy throughout the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hopes Dashed Over Weekend, Negotiations Continued Today </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The NLC refused the GON\'s proposed deal of 35 naira </p><p>per liter of fuel.  The NLC maintained that 32 naira per </p><p>liter was its maximum.  However, negotiations between the NLC </p><p>and GON continued this afternoon.   The Trade Union Congress </p><p>(TUC), Nigeria\'s white collar union, refused to join the </p><p>strike and the TUC\'s statement was the source of inaccurate </p><p>press reports July 6 that the strike had ended.  PENGASSAN, </p><p>the white collar oil union, reportedly set a mid-night </p><p>deadline to reach agreement before reconsidering </p><p>noninvolvement in the strike. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Confusion at the Presidency and Labor </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) President Obasanjo told Ambassador Jeter on Saturday </p><p>that Labor negotiators were beginning to see the economic </p><p>rationale for his insistence on 35 naira per liter as the </p><p>floor below which the price could not drop.  He explained 35 </p><p>was the minimum price that would spur importation of refined </p><p>product thus alleviating frequent fuel shortages.  Obasanjo </p><p>predicted Labor could ultimately be satisfied with his </p><p>explanation but there was still some convincing to do.  He </p><p>believed NLC leader Adams Oshiomole understood these economic </p><p>realities but was no longer in full control of the NLC and </p><p>had to contend with a more hard-line element who wanted to </p><p>hold out for a lower fuel price.  Nonetheless, according to </p><p>Obasanjo, labor negotiators had conceded the need for a price </p><p>hike.  Most had also conceded that Labor would support a </p><p>second modest hike later on that would bring the fuel price </p><p>to 40 naira per liter by the end of the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) President Obasanjo told GON negotiators over the </p><p>weekend not to give in to Labor\'s demand, according to </p><p>several sources at the Presidency.  Obasanjo may have been </p><p>overly optimistic about his ability to persuade Labor to </p><p>accept the 35 naira per liter price but was correct in </p><p>stating there was a split within the NLC between Oshiomole </p><p>and more hard-line elements in the NLC\'s National Executive </p><p>Council (NEC).  Oshiomole told Econoff that he would </p><p>recommend that the NLC accept a 33 naira increase and allow </p><p>gas prices to rise over the next year.  Senior NLC officials </p><p>told Econoff on Sunday that most of the NEC rejected </p><p>Oshiomole\'s proposal, adhering to the 32 naira ceiling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON Officials Confirm At Least 13 Dead </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) GON police officials confirmed to Poloff that police </p><p>killed four strikers (reftel) last week.  Contacts </p><p>sympathetic to the strike claimed up to six more people </p><p>killed by the police.  In Port Harcourt, press reports </p><p>confirmed at least three deaths.  There are unconfirmed </p><p>reports of strike-related deaths elsewhere in the South. </p><p>Students and labor leaders were also reported temporarily </p><p>detained throughout the country last week, with many </p><p>remaining under detention without formal charges. </p><p>Fuel and Food Prices Increase Dramatically </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>7. (U) Fuel on the black-market sold for up to 300 naira per </p><p>liter in Abuja, while in Kano and Zaria fuel was selling from </p><p>100 to 120 naira per liter; most stations, with reserves </p><p>running low, remained closed country-wide.  In Abuja\'s main </p><p>market, prices have increased 30 to 40 percent over the last </p><p>week, transportation costs have risen from 100 to 200 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The gap between the GON and NLC positions has </p><p>narrowed. We now have independent voices inside and outside </p><p>government putting pressure on both sides to quickly end the </p><p>strike.  But closing the remaining distance will be tough. </p><p>Obasanjo is stating there is no economic justification for </p><p>descending below the 35 naira price level.  While Labor, </p><p>given the success of the strike, sees no political reason to </p><p>accede to the Government\'s position; moreover, most of Labor </p><p>views the GON economic rationale suspiciously.  President </p><p>Obasanjo leaves for the AU summit tomorrow morning and does </p><p>return until July 11.  While Obasanjo is away, a resolution </p><p>is even more unlikely.  Thus, if an accord is not reached </p><p>today, the strike will continue.   End Comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
