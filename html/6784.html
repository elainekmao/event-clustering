<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000566 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 03/19/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PARM, SF, SG, IZ, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT OBASANJO DISAVOWS HIS MINISTER\'S </p><p>COMMENTS AND TALKS ABOUT THE IRAQ LETTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABUJA 555 </p><p>-    B) ABUJA 551 </p><p>-    C) ABUJA 513 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason 1.5 (B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: During a midnight March 21 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, President Obasanjo distanced the GON from </p><p>Minister of State Onyia\'s accusation that the U.S. had cut </p><p>military assistance because of Nigeria\'s position on Iraq. </p><p>Obasanjo also expressed surprise at Washington\'s negative </p><p>reaction to the Obasanjo/Mbeki/Wade letter, claiming it merely </p><p>restated the GON\'s existing position.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>ONYIA SUFFERS A BOUT OF FOOT IN MOUTH DISEASE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a midnight March 21 meeting with President </p><p>Obasanjo following Obasanjo\'s first Presidential debate, </p><p>Ambassador Jeter lodged a complaint regarding Minister of </p><p>State for Foreign Affairs Dubem Onyia\'s malicious statement to </p><p>Nigerian media that the United states had stopped military </p><p>assistance to Nigeria because of its Iraq policy. Ambassador </p><p>Jeter told Obasanjo that he had met Onyia earlier that day at </p><p>the Minister\'s request. Onyia, citing the March 20 meeting </p><p>between the Ambassador and MFA Permanent Secretary Dan Hart, </p><p>accused the USG of cutting military assistance because of </p><p>displeasure over Nigeria\'s position on Iraq. Onyia asserted </p><p>the United States, in trying to intimidate Nigeria, had also </p><p>affronted its sovereignty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador explained to the President that he </p><p>clearly and unequivocally told Onyia the alleged nexus between </p><p>military assistance and Iraq was nonexistent. He told Onyia </p><p>the March 20 meeting with Hart was to brief the MFA PermSec on </p><p>the Mission\'s security posture, including the closure to </p><p>public traffic and of consular operations at both the Embassy </p><p>and Lagos Consulate, and to thank the GON for the outstanding </p><p>security support it had provided. The Ambassador also told </p><p>Onyia that, because he had not seen Hart for some time, he had </p><p>used the meeting to brief the Permanent Secretary on several </p><p>key issues, suspension of security assistance being just one </p><p>of them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador also told the President that he had </p><p>assured Onyia that the assistance suspension was not related </p><p>to Iraq but was due to human rights concerns regarding the </p><p>October 2001 Zaki Biam massacres.  Moreover, we had informed </p><p>Onyia that the President and Defense Minister were aware of </p><p>the suspension and reasons behind it because this issue had </p><p>been active for over a year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) However, Jeter told the President that the Minister of </p><p>State apparently summoned the press immediately after the </p><p>meeting to issue his inaccurate statement, notwithstanding our </p><p>assurances to the contrary. Ambassador Jeter said he found </p><p>Onyia\'s conduct extremely disappointing. Not only was the </p><p>statement recklessly false, it could hurt our relations with </p><p>other African countries by casting the USG in a bad light and </p><p>could also foment resentment in Nigeria toward the United </p><p>States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) After hearing the Ambassador\'s explanation, Obasanjo </p><p>turned to his Special Advisor on International Affairs Ad\'obe </p><p>Obe, declaring, "My God, is that what this is all about?" The </p><p>evening of March 20, Onyia had rushed to the Villa claiming </p><p>Washington was "subtly blackmailing" Abuja due to Nigeria\'s </p><p>stance on Iraq, Obasanjo revealed. Based on Onyia\'s </p><p>accusation, Obasanjo instructed him to convoke the Ambassador. </p><p>"I don\'t take blackmail very well," Obasanjo remarked. </p><p>However, if he had known the fillip behind the accusation was </p><p>the assistance suspension, he would have bridled the Minister </p><p>of State. The suspension was old news and completely unrelated </p><p>to Iraq, Obasanjo stated. Uncharacteristically, Obasanjo even </p><p>apologized for Onyia\'s blunder and mismanagement of the issue. </p><p>(Comment:  Much less kind, Adobe earlier called the Ambassador </p><p>with the exclamation: "What is Dubem doing? This time I think </p><p>he\'s gone over the edge."  End Comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Asserting that the GON would publicly correct the </p><p>record, Obasanjo instructed Obe to have Foreign Minister Sule </p><p>Lamido make a public statement retracting Onyia\'s error. </p><p>(COMMENT:  As of 1800 on March 24, the Mission is not aware of </p><p>any correction of the record undertaken by the GON, but some </p><p>newspapers over the March 22-23 weekend carried the Embassy\'s </p><p>statement on the subject.  END COMMENT). </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE MY LETTER </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Turning to his tripartite letter with Mbeki and Wade, </p><p>Obasanjo expressed surprise about the White House\'s reaction. </p><p>For Nigeria, the letter simply restated existing policy that </p><p>Iraq should fully disarm as a condition precedent to the </p><p>withdrawal of coalition troops. Obasanjo thought he actually </p><p>performed a favor for Washington by persuading Mbeki to take a </p><p>more moderate position than would have been the South </p><p>African\'s natural inclination. Moreover, the letter was not </p><p>sent as the "African position" but as the position of three </p><p>individual Heads of State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Obasanjo\'s described President Wade\'s role in the </p><p>entire affair as that of a mercurial, unreliable partner. Wade </p><p>heartily agreed to the initial letter, and even suggested it, </p><p>only to send an alternative letter two days later and one day </p><p>after the originals had been transmitted to President Bush and </p><p>Saddam. Wade\'s excuse was that, upon his return to Dakar from </p><p>Niamey, his advisors convinced him the letter should not have </p><p>been signed. "When I sign a letter, I sign a letter. I am my </p><p>own boss and I thought he was his; if not, that is his </p><p>problem, not mine," Obasanjo scoffed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Obasanjo said he would like to put the disagreement </p><p>with Washington over the letter behind him. The war is on and </p><p>will have to run its course, while he has a full menu of </p><p>pressing domestic issues, Obasanjo acknowledged. While wanting </p><p>to relegate the letter to history, the President mentioned, </p><p>however, that he was troubled by a telephone call from a White </p><p>House official about the tripartite letter. He claimed the </p><p>official spoke harshly and "harangued" him. He thought it </p><p>untoward that the official would talk to him so brusquely when </p><p>the letter, he believed, was moderate in tone and substance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment: Given the friction caused by the tripartite </p><p>letter and Onyia\'s willful distortion of our reaction to </p><p>Nigeria\'s Iraq policy, Obasanjo seemed ready to end his foray </p><p>into active diplomacy on Iraq. With the battle for Iraq now </p><p>on, he also realizes, if he did not before, that his words </p><p>would have little effect at this point. We expect that he will </p><p>eventually get the Foreign Minister to publicly correct </p><p>Onyia\'s mistake.  After that, Obasanjo will do well to take </p><p>his own advice and focus on his bevy of problems at home. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
