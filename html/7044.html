Jones for reason 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>INTRODUCTION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) While the world focuses on the short-term humanitarian </p><p>needs of the Iraqi people, it is obvious that the </p><p>resurrection of the Iraqi economy, demolished by decades of </p><p>mismanagement, will require literally trillions of dollars. </p><p>This burden cannot be borne by the international community; </p><p>the vast bulk of this capital must come from the private </p><p>sector.  Unique USG programs such as the Overseas Private </p><p>Investment Corporation (OPIC), the U.S. Trade and Development </p><p>Agency (USTDA) and the Export-Import Bank of the United </p><p>States (EX-IM) can and should play a major role in </p><p>facilitating the flow of U.S. trade and investment into the </p><p>new Iraq.  Similar programs within the World Bank Group such </p><p>as the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and </p><p>the International Finance Corporation (IFC) should also be </p><p>encouraged to play significant roles at the multilateral </p><p>level.  Finally, technical assistance programs, perhaps </p><p>orchestrated by USAID and the Treasury Department\'s Office of </p><p>Technical Assistance, could help capital-rich Persian Gulf </p><p>states develop their own institutions to provide trade and </p><p>investment finance programs similar to these, thereby </p><p>mobilizing their wealth more effectively for investment </p><p>projects in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p>PROPOSAL </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) With the above in mind, Embassy Kuwait proposes: </p><p> </p><p>a) to shortly open a joint FCS/OPIC/TDA/EX-IM office in </p><p>Kuwait to provide front line support to U.S. exporters </p><p>seeking to do business in the new Iraq, possibly using MEPI </p><p>funds to support the establishment of the operation </p><p> </p><p>b) that USDOC and Treasury work closely with IMIs such as the </p><p>World Bank to encourage MIGA, IFC and other similar programs </p><p>to consider rapidly establishing programs to promote the </p><p>rebuilding of the Iraqi economy </p><p> </p><p>c) that USAID and Treasury\'s Office of Technical Assistance, </p><p>possibly working with the World Bank and others, develop </p><p>proposals for programs to help Kuwait and other Persian Gulf </p><p>states develop trade and investment guarantee programs </p><p>similar to OPIC and EX-IM. </p><p> </p><p>PROPOSAL A: US TRADE PROMOTION OFFICE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) To date, post has received hundreds of inquiries from </p><p>Kuwaiti firms seeking information on how they can do business </p><p>in the new Iraq, and many of these either already have U.S. </p><p>partners or are actively looking for U.S. partners. </p><p>Separately, many U.S. firms have expressed their intent to </p><p>fully exploit the business opportunities opened by the fall </p><p>of the Hussein regime.  However, it seems clear that Iraq </p><p>will be a difficult place to do business for some time, and </p><p>legal and regulatory structures and financial systems will </p><p>require massive restructuring.  The perceptions of political </p><p>risks are also likely to remain high, at least in the medium </p><p>term. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) U.S. exporters of goods and services are more than able </p><p>to assess commercial risks, but will look elsewhere for </p><p>protection from political risks.  These, of course, are </p><p>exactly the risks agencies such as EX-IM and OPIC are </p><p>designed to help firms mitigate.  For example, until a modern </p><p>international payment system is in place, and until economic </p><p>activity in Iraq expands to the point where consumers have </p><p>disposable income, U.S. exporters are unlikely to sign </p><p>significant supply contracts with revived Iraqi firms, nor </p><p>are they likely to find banks willing to extend significant </p><p>credit for such trade.  EX-IM guarantee and lending programs </p><p>may provide sufficient comfort to exporters and lenders to </p><p>encourage the onset of such trading activity.  And OPIC </p><p>investment guarantee programs would similarly allow U.S. </p><p>firms to more fully participate in the reconstruction of Iraq </p><p>by shielding firms from political risks so they can focus on </p><p>commercial investments that will create badly needed jobs and </p><p>revive a decimated Iraqi economy.  Finally, TDA programs such </p><p>as funding feasibility studies can introduce key officials in </p><p>the new Iraqi government and in the private sector to U.S. </p><p>firms and technologies that will help quickly reintroduce </p><p>Iraq to the modern world economy. </p><p> </p><p>WHY KUWAIT? </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.(C)  Our proposal is to open a joint FCS/OPIC/TDA/EX-IM </p><p>office here in Kuwait that will serve as a service center for </p><p>U.S. firms coming to the region for business in Iraq.  The </p><p>office should be led by US&FCS, with its extensive network of </p><p>commercial offices throughout the U.S. and its expertise in </p><p>business counseling.  We see the office located in Kuwait for </p><p>several reasons.  First and foremost, Kuwait is the only Arab </p><p>country that has publicly and repeatedly stated its support </p><p>for coalition actions against Iraq.  In addition to this </p><p>verbal support, Kuwait is providing literally hundreds of </p><p>millions, if not billions, of dollars worth of support for </p><p>the military effort. </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) Beyond these political factors, Kuwaitis control </p><p>hundreds of billions of dollars of private capital, capital </p><p>that will be badly needed to rebuild Iraqi farms, businesses, </p><p>and factories.  Kuwait has a long history of commercial and </p><p>family ties in Iraq, especially in the South, and Kuwaitis </p><p>tell us that they already have their eyes set on </p><p>reestablishing and building on those relationships.  Helping </p><p>to build those relationships between Iraq, Kuwait, and the </p><p>other states of the Gulf Cooperation Council will be </p><p>important to reestablishing stability in the region. </p><p>Finally, many Kuwaiti companies already have strong ties, as </p><p>agents, distributors, or partners with U.S. firms, and those </p><p>Kuwaiti firms could be an invaluable source of knowledge </p><p>about Iraqi market conditions for U.S. firms seeking to enter </p><p>the new Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>7.(C) Establishing the office quickly in the region will be a </p><p>clear signal of U.S. intent to participate fully in the </p><p>reconstruction effort in partnership with Kuwait and other </p><p>GCC states.  It also will encourage U.S. firms to seriously </p><p>consider partnerships with local firms as they pursue </p><p>business opportunities.  Eventually, the office could be </p><p>relocated to Baghdad, but Kuwait offers a safe and secure </p><p>location, with excellent infrastructure, to initiate </p><p>operations.  While individual agencies would likely absorb </p><p>their own personnel costs, we suggest that MEPI funds could </p><p>be a source for the start-up costs. </p><p> </p><p>PROPOSAL B: MIGA AND IFC </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) Of course, U.S. firms are not the only companies that </p><p>will look to do business in the new Iraq, nor could they </p><p>provide all the capital needed.  Some projects may be so </p><p>large that they will require the creation of multi-national </p><p>consortia to undertake.  For these multinational efforts, one </p><p>must turn to multinational agencies for support.  Hence the </p><p>involvement of MIGA and the IFC will be vital.  We understand </p><p>that neither has underwritten projects in Iraq for years, and </p><p>that important issues such as IMF arrears will need to be </p><p>addressed before they can resume such work.  However, we </p><p>encourage Washington agencies to begin (or, more likely, </p><p>accelerate) discussions with the IMIs to rapidly deal with </p><p>any significant impediments and to quickly resume operations </p><p>with a new Iraqi government.  MIGA investment guarantee </p><p>programs are particularly influential on financial </p><p>institutions making major lending decisions.  The ability of </p><p>the IFC to take direct equity stakes in important projects in </p><p>Iraq would be an important political signal to the Iraqi </p><p>people of the international community\'s commitment to their </p><p>economic well-being and its faith in their economy. </p><p> </p><p>PROPOSAL C: TA FOR OPIC/EX-IM LIKE PROGRAMS IN THE GULF </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>9.(C) As noted above, Kuwait (and other Gulf states) controls </p><p>hundreds of billions of dollars in private capital, mostly </p><p>held in Western equities.  This capital, properly mobilized, </p><p>could be an invaluable source of funds for job and wealth </p><p>creation for the Iraqis.  However, Gulf financial </p><p>institutions tend to be relatively unsophisticated and </p><p>notoriously risk-averse.  Arab-wide programs such as the </p><p>Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation (IAIGC) are </p><p>relatively small (IAIGC wrote only 3 investment guarantees in </p><p>2001 according to its annual report), and, according to our </p><p>Kuwaiti interlocutors, are prone to paralysis caused by </p><p>political interference.  We believe that with the appropriate </p><p>technical assistance, Gulf states could easily develop their </p><p>own trade and investment guarantee organizations.  We have </p><p>tested the idea of a "Kuwait Iraqi Private Investment </p><p>Company" on a few select Kuwaiti contacts, and they expressed </p><p>enthusiasm for the idea.  With a few tens of millions of </p><p>Kuwaiti Dinars as capital, such an institution could mobilize </p><p>hundreds of millions of private investment, with profits </p><p>plowed back into the organization. </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) We are reluctant to shop the idea around too much, </p><p>however, if we cannot provide the necessary support.  We see </p><p>that Treasury\'s Office of Technical Assistance, perhaps </p><p>working with USAID, would likely be the best source of the </p><p>training and advice for Gulf states to establish their own </p><p>domestic programs.  If Washington will signal is willingness </p><p>and ability to provide such assistance (again, possibly </p><p>funded by MEPI if not by the governments themselves), we can </p><p>then engage more fully with our interlocutors to help them </p><p>develop a formal proposal. </p><p> </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>11.(C) Fully engaging the U.S. and GCC private sector in </p><p>Iraq\'s reconstruction effort will be vital to its success. </p><p>The most important issues to achieve this will be the most </p><p>basic -- transparent and predictable legal and regulatory </p><p>structures, business friendly tax regimes, and the other key </p><p>elements of the investment climate.  We look to the Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance to work with the </p><p>new Iraqi government to do everything possible to get these </p><p>elements right.  These are the necessary conditions to </p><p>attract trade and investment, but they are not sufficient. </p><p>In addition, governments will need to take steps to encourage </p><p>their firms to seriously consider entering the Iraqi market, </p><p>and to provide comfort to those who do.  We believe steps </p><p>such as those outlined above will go far to help attract </p><p>foreign investment into Iraq, and more importantly, to ensure </p><p>the Iraqi people benefit fully from their hard-won freedom. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
