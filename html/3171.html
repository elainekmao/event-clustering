<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001455 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/S, AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Text of Letter from Zimbabwe Opposition Leader to </p><p>President Bush </p><p> </p><p>REF: Fax to AF/S </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. </p><p>Not for Internet posting. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On June 19, the opposition Movement for Democratic </p><p>Change (MDC) delivered to all G-8 embassies in Harare a </p><p>letter from its president, Morgan Tsvangirai, to their </p><p>respective heads of government.  Below is the verbatim text </p><p>of the letter addressed to President Bush.  A copy of the </p><p>original is being faxed to AF/S (ref). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>Mr. George W. Bush </p><p>President of the United States of America </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. President, </p><p> </p><p>I write to you on the eve of the historic Group of 8 Most </p><p>Industralised Countries/New Partnership for African </p><p>Development (G8/NEPAD) summit in Canada.  I would have </p><p>welcomed an opportunity for direct consultations with you on </p><p>various matters of mutual interest, but as you may be aware, </p><p>I am currently prohibited to travel outside Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>Over the past forty years or more, the story of Africa has </p><p>been one of utmost dejection, hopelessness and despair, with </p><p>grinding poverty seemingly defeating all possibilities for </p><p>relief and redress.  Tragically, the African experience is </p><p>replete with elaborate development strategies, programmes of </p><p>action etc., but all followed by a dismal record of inaction </p><p>and painful failure.  Lack of capacity, lack of political </p><p>will, lack of resources, endemic corruption and bad </p><p>governance accounted for this routine and systematic </p><p>failure.  The cost, in terms of missed opportunities and </p><p>indeed human life has been astronomical. </p><p> </p><p>However, a fortuitous convergence of circumstances, both </p><p>within and outside the continent seems to have, at long </p><p>last, created a rare, unprecedented and unique opportunity </p><p>for a serious search for renewal, for a new beginning. </p><p>NEPAD brings a message of hope to the African continent.  In </p><p>the words of one of the greatest statesman of the twentieth </p><p>century, albeit, in a slightly different context, for us </p><p>NEPAD, if successfully implemented represents a vast </p><p>cooperative effort, unparalleled in magnitude and nobility </p><p>of purpose to satisfy the burning needs of the African </p><p>people for economic progress, freedom from hunger and </p><p>disease, from dictatorship and despair.  It will stand tall </p><p>as a shining tribute to the power of the creative energies </p><p>of free men and women - an example to the entire world that </p><p>liberty and progress can walk hand in hand.  It will </p><p>engender a new spirit of enterprise that will create a brave </p><p>new continent where poverty, disease and ignorance will have </p><p>no place.  NEPAD must not be allowed to remain at the level </p><p>of appearances and unfulfilled hopes and promises. </p><p> </p><p>It is in this context that we in the Movement for Democratic </p><p>Change (MDC) welcome the NEPAD initiative.  Here in </p><p>Zimbabwe, in our own small-localized way, we have been </p><p>struggling, against perilous odds, guided by the ideals of </p><p>good governance, democracy, human rights, the rule of law </p><p>and sustainable economic management and development.  The </p><p>same ideals that are enshrined in, and underpin NEPAD. </p><p> </p><p>You will no doubt, agree with us, that is spite of the </p><p>generally hostile political terrain, the culture of </p><p>democratic governance is taking root in a number of African </p><p>countries, with brave voices of agony being heard across the </p><p>globe from a people who refuse to continue to succumb to </p><p>dictatorship and decay.  We believe that NEPAD should play a </p><p>critical role in strengthening these desperate voices. </p><p>NEPAD should ensure that disease, poverty and ignorance </p><p>would provide neither a breeding ground for, nor offer </p><p>opportunities for regression into autocratic forms of </p><p>governance and economic decay. </p><p> </p><p>However, we equally and strongly believe that Africa cannot </p><p>meaningfully engage the international community without </p><p>first tackling problems that threaten both regional and </p><p>continental security and political stability.  There is or </p><p>ought to be a direct linkage.  The litmus test lies in </p><p>Africans ending rhetoric and taking tangible action to help </p><p>resolve thorny issues in accordance with standards of </p><p>conduct and performance that they have set for themselves. </p><p>They should be judged by the standards that they have </p><p>voluntary designed and accepted.  NEPAD provides such a set </p><p>of standards. </p><p> </p><p>ZANU PF and the Mugabe regime are intensifying a programme </p><p>of systematic violence to punish the MDC and civic </p><p>organisations and compel them to accept the results of the </p><p>March 2002 fraudulent presidential poll results.  All the </p><p>material facts on the ground in Zimbabwe today indicate that </p><p>the Mugabe regime is putting finishing touches to </p><p>preparations for a stage-managed serious domestic conflict </p><p>that would see the death of thousands of innocent civilians. </p><p> </p><p>We in the MDC stand ready for constructive dialogue that </p><p>would lead to a peaceful resolution of the crisis facing our </p><p>country today, but Mugabe and his associates are bent on a </p><p>destructive path that can only degenerate into a serious </p><p>internal conflict verging on civil war.  As Mugabe totters </p><p>towards the sunset of his biological and political life, he </p><p>seems determined to take Zimbabwe down with him. </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe remains NEPAD\'s biggest challenge.  It will test </p><p>the sincerity and commitment of Africa\'s leaders to the </p><p>concept of "peer review".  It is tragically nave in the </p><p>extreme to expect dictators to reform and change out of </p><p>"self-interest" alone as alluded to by the President of </p><p>South Africa.  If this were the case, there would have been </p><p>no Zimbabwe crisis since self-interest would have impelled </p><p>Mugabe to disembark from his ruinous course of action.  Peer </p><p>pressure must translate into a real cost for the maintenance </p><p>of autocratic forms of government.  It must be seen to real </p><p>and effective.  Dictators such as Robert Mugabe do not care </p><p>about the general welfare of those that they rule and </p><p>oppress.  Instead, an impoverished and hopeless people </p><p>precisely offer the kind of environment in which dictators </p><p>like Robert Mugabe thrive.  That is the real "self-interest" </p><p>of Robert Mugabe.  He cannot be expected to reform himself </p><p>out of a dictatorship, which he deliberately constructed and </p><p>constantly nourishes. </p><p> </p><p>In the context of SADC it appears that so far there has not </p><p>been any intention to take peer review seriously.  As you </p><p>are aware, the SADC Parliamentary Forum produced the "Norms </p><p>and Standards for Elections in the SADC Region" which was </p><p>adopted by all SADC states, including Zimbabwe and South </p><p>Africa, (which is one of the key movers of NEPAD) in March </p><p>2001.  None of the Election Observer Missions from the SADC </p><p>countries and Nigeria in particular and the African </p><p>continent in general adhered to these norms and standards in </p><p>their monitoring and evaluation of the Zimbabwe presidential </p><p>poll.  The SADC Parliamentary Forum proceeded to use these </p><p>supposedly agreed standards to monitor the Zimbabwe </p><p>presidential polls in March 2002 and produced a damning </p><p>report on the Zimbabwe presidential poll, while country </p><p>Election Observer Missions produced ringing endorsements of </p><p>what was clearly a rigged and violent poll.  It is poignant </p><p>to note that Election Observer Missions from South Africa </p><p>and Nigeria, whose presidents are positioning themselves as </p><p>some of the peer review leaders, either totally ignored or </p><p>were openly contemptuous of the SADC Parliamentary Norms and </p><p>Standards.  This was a tragic failure to apply peer pressure </p><p>on the Mugabe regime to abandon a systematic programme of </p><p>violence in order to steal the presidential poll and we have </p><p>absolutely no confidence in the renewed claim by African </p><p>leaders that this time round, in the context of NEPAD peer </p><p>review and pressure would be effective.  In the absence of </p><p>any redeeming action on the part of South Africa and </p><p>Nigeria, it is difficult to regard this renewed commitment </p><p>to peer pressure as anything but a ruse to get NEPAD off the </p><p>launching pad.  The leaders of South Africa and Nigeria must </p><p>be honest with themselves, with Zimbabwe and with the </p><p>international commitment.  If they are reluctant to apply </p><p>meaningful peer pressure on Mugabe, what guarantee does the </p><p>international community have that any other murderous </p><p>African dictator would be treated differently?  Statesmen do </p><p>not say one thing and proceed to do something totally </p><p>different. </p><p> </p><p>We suggest that as a mark of seriousness and good faith, </p><p>South Africa and Nigeria, the two key players in NEPAD with </p><p>the most real leverage on Mugabe, should become more </p><p>assertive and encourage Mugabe to return to the negotiating </p><p>table.  The G8 and other international friends and well </p><p>wishers of Zimbabwe can also offer an effective positive </p><p>hand.  They should make it clear that the progress of NEPAD </p><p>would be problematic unless peer pressure on the Mugabe </p><p>regime is seen to be producing positive results. </p><p> </p><p>NEPAD should not offer succor and comfort to dictatorial </p><p>regimes that are precisely the root cause of Africa\'s </p><p>present predicament.  The present Government of Zimbabwe </p><p>constitutes a serious threat to the central tenets of NEPAD. </p><p>Peer pressure does not seem to have been applied seriously </p><p>on the Mugabe regime.  Since 2001, many regional and </p><p>continental missions have been to Zimbabwe, but not one of </p><p>them has successfully pressurized Mugabe to abandon his </p><p>naked abuse of power and his total disregard and utter </p><p>contempt for internationally accepted norms of democracy and </p><p>good governance.  Indeed some of these missions, such as the </p><p>SADC Ministerial Task Force, which met in Harare in </p><p>September 2001 openly, supported Mugabe\'s reckless and </p><p>violent ways.  Periodic summits of the SADC Heads of State </p><p>have routinely delivered messages of support for Mugabe\'s </p><p>dictatorship; the present Chairman of SADC, Malawian </p><p>President Bakili Muluzi has announced his firm intention to </p><p>reverse the march and gains of democracy in his impoverished </p><p>and starving country; and Zambia\'s presidential poll result </p><p>remains controversial and contested.  Clearly, by its own </p><p>record, SADC does not constitute a peer group that inspires </p><p>confidence.  So far it does not have a demonstrable ability </p><p>and track record of monitoring democracy and good governance </p><p>in the region.  SADC in general and South Africa in </p><p>particular must create a new set of bona fides to show that </p><p>they are a serious regional peer review group.  Zimbabwe </p><p>must be a starting point. </p><p> </p><p>I avail myself, Mr. President, this opportunity to renew the </p><p>assurances of my highest consideration. </p><p> </p><p>I remain, </p><p>Yours sincerely, </p><p> </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai, </p><p>President Movement for Democratic Change </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
