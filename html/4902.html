<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 009193 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, H, EB, EUR/SE AND NEA </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR FOR DBIRDSEY </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PREL, TU, IS, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT:  Turkish Foreign Trade Officials Seeking Broader </p><p>QIZ, New FTAs </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  In recent meetings, Foreign Trade </p><p>officials reiterated their desire for a QIZ with fewer </p><p>sectoral restrictions, contending that, in its current </p><p>form, the QIZ would have a very limited impact on Turkish </p><p>exports.  They also made contradictory statements on the </p><p>EU Customs Union and its relationship to an FTA with the </p><p>United States.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>QIZs </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In a December 24 meeting with Husnu Dilemre, </p><p>Deputy Director General for Agreements, Econoff noted that </p><p>U.S. legislation to create Qualifying Industrial Zones in </p><p>Turkey would have to be resubmitted to the new Congress, </p><p>and that the legislative vehicle for doing this is not yet </p><p>clear.  Dilemre said that he hoped this would provide an </p><p>opportunity to revisit the QIZ\'s sectoral exclusions, as </p><p>Foreign Trade\'s research to date had shown that a QIZ, in </p><p>the form originally proposed, would have little economic </p><p>benefit.  He offered an alternate proposal which would </p><p>limit a Turkey QIZ\'s impact on sensitive sectors of the </p><p>U.S. economy by capping total exports (at a level to be </p><p>negotiated) in exchange for the right to export duty-free </p><p>in all sectors.  This single QIZ, to be located in an area </p><p>of high unemployment (likely in eastern Turkey), would be </p><p>used as a development tool.  Dilemre implied that this </p><p>idea had not been fully cleared by the new State Minister </p><p>for Foreign Trade Kursad Tuzmen.  Econoff said he would </p><p>report the idea. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Customs Union and FTAs </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Meeting with new Foreign Trade Undersecretary </p><p>Tuncer Kayalar on December 20, Ag Couns and Econoff </p><p>discussed new Turkish quarantine regulations (septel) and </p><p>the EU customs union.  Commenting on State Minister </p><p>Tuzmen\'s recent statements calling for review of the </p><p>customs union, Kayalar told us that the GOT would not seek </p><p>wholesale revisions to the customs union.  Rather, Turkey </p><p>is seeking EU support in negotiating free trade agreements </p><p>with third countries.  Under the customs union, Turkey is </p><p>required to align commercial and trade policy with the EU, </p><p>which includes signing FTAs with the same third countries. </p><p>Kayalar told us that some of these third countries are </p><p>delaying negotiations because of an asymmetry in </p><p>industrial tariffs:  some countries, notably Algeria, have </p><p>little incentive to conclude an FTA because they would be </p><p>required to cut their own relatively high tariffs on </p><p>Turkish goods to zero, while Turkish tariffs on their </p><p>goods are already relatively low.  Kayalar said Turkey </p><p>seeks EU pressure on these countries to accelerate </p><p>negotiations and end Turkish firms\' competitive </p><p>disadvantage vis-a-vis European exporters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Kayalar also said the GOT is interested in </p><p>negotiating FTAs with the United States, Russia and </p><p>Ukraine, none of which have FTAs with the EU.  He </p><p>acknowledged that this would require a derogation from the </p><p>EU, and that obtaining this would be difficult.  However, </p><p>he added that the new GOT would try harder than its </p><p>predecessors in this area.  Conversely, Dilemre told </p><p>Econoff several days later that an FTA with the United </p><p>States would be a major departure from current Turkish </p><p>trade policy, which is based on alignment with EU </p><p>commercial/trade policy under the customs union.  He also </p><p>questioned the value of negotiating an agreement that </p><p>would have to be abandoned on Turkey\'s EU accession. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Turks have raised the idea of an FTA with the </p><p>United States periodically over the last several years, </p><p>while acknowledging that it is not compatible with the </p><p>customs union.  Further, it is not clear that the GOT </p><p>would be willing to offer the concessions (lowering </p><p>tariffs and non-tariff barriers, especially in </p><p>agriculture, strengthening intellectual property </p><p>protection, among others) needed to negotiate an FTA based </p><p>on mutual benefit.  For these reasons, the Turks have </p><p>sought unilateral preferences, such as U.S. concessions in </p><p>the textiles and apparel trade and a less restrictive QIZ, </p><p>rather than a more far-reaching reciprocal liberalization </p><p>of trade. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
