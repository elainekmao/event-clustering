<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003114 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: STATE OF DIVORCE LAW IN JORDAN:  MILD IMPROVEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM DOUGLAS A. SILLIMAN.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Government of Jordan issued a cabinet </p><p>decree in December 2001 that allows certain Muslim women, </p><p>within a narrow legal framework, to bring a divorce action in </p><p>Sharia Court.  To date, over 500 women have filed for divorce </p><p>under the new law; so far the court has granted divorces in 2 </p><p>of these cases.  While this law has not been formally </p><p>approved by the parliament and is narrowly tailored, it </p><p>appears to be a step towards a more accommodative Sharia </p><p>legal apparatus for Jordanian women in insufferable </p><p>marriages.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)   Previously, a woman could not file for divorce </p><p>absent the consent of her husband.  The husband could grant </p><p>such consent expressly in the original marriage contract or </p><p>any time thereafter.  However, a woman could, under </p><p>extraordinary circumstances, convince a Sharia judge to grant </p><p>a divorce on her behalf.  Under the old law, there were four </p><p>grounds through which such a divorce could be granted: </p><p>proof  (to an extremely high degree of certainty) that her </p><p>husband had physically abused her, abandonment or </p><p>imprisonment of the husband for one year or more, refusal to </p><p>pay living expense, and \'ongoing disputes\' between the </p><p>couple.  Such divorces were granted sparingly on behalf of </p><p>women in extreme cases of physical abuse or abandonment, and </p><p>the legal process often took years at exorbitant cost. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>CABINET DECREE\'S GENESIS IN THE HADITH, EGYPT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The cabinet decree is based on a passage in the </p><p>Hadith, where the Prophet Mohammad granted a divorce to a </p><p>woman, provided that she returned her dowry (in that case a </p><p>garden) to her husband.  In this passage, the woman told </p><p>Mohammad that, although her husband was a good man, she did </p><p>not want to perform her womanly duties with him.  She was </p><p>allowed to divorce her husband.  Using this passage as a </p><p>precedent, Nora Sadat (wife of the late Egyptian President) </p><p>succeeded in her longstanding effort to establish the right </p><p>for women to divorce in Egyptian Sharia Court.  In a </p><p>conversation with POLOFF, human rights activist Saeda Kilani </p><p>said that, although the Islamists in Egypt were miffed about </p><p>the law, they grudgingly accepted it.  The Jordanian decree </p><p>is based upon the Egyptian law, and allows for a woman to </p><p>bring a divorce action if she is able to repay her dowry and </p><p>cede all financial benefits from the marriage. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>FASTER DIVORCES FOR SOME WOMEN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The new law allows for women to bring an action </p><p>independent of her husband or a Sharia judge, and affords </p><p>them greater expediency.    However, as currently construed, </p><p>the law does not allow a large percentage of women to bring a </p><p>divorce action.  Women from wealthier families (who are </p><p>willing to live with the social stigma of a divorced </p><p>daughter) may provide the financial backing their daughters </p><p>need to go forward with a divorce action, but the majority of </p><p>women do not have such a luxury.  If a woman does get past </p><p>the financial issue, she still must convince a Sharia judge </p><p>that she has legitimate grounds for a divorce.  There are no </p><p>codified grounds through which a divorce may be granted. </p><p>However, according to Zarqa social worker Nadia Bushnaq, </p><p>Sharia Courts are most likely to grant divorces under the new </p><p>law in cases of life-threatening physical abuse or </p><p>abandonment.  (NOTE:  One of the two women who have been </p><p>granted a divorce under the decree told a local newspaper </p><p>that she had suffered physical abuse by her husband for 13 </p><p>years).  As for child custody, young children are more likely </p><p>to be granted to the mother, whereas older children (girls </p><p>who have begun to menstruate and boys who are 12 years of </p><p>age) are almost always put in the custody of the father or </p><p>his family. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>LAW DOES NOT COVER CHRISTIAN WOMEN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)    Jordan does not grant civil marriages or divorces, </p><p>so Christian women must get a divorce via their church\'s </p><p>legal apparatus, and may not avail themselves of a Sharia </p><p>Court.  These courts adjudicate divorce actions in accordance </p><p>with church law.  In a meeting with POLOFF, a Roman Catholic </p><p>woman claimed that, despite years of severe physical abuse, </p><p>her church would not grant her a divorce.  At the same time, </p><p>her family forbids her from filing criminal action against </p><p>her husband because it would besmirch the family name. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p> COMMENT </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  While this new law is a cabinet decree that could </p><p>potentially be dismissed when parliament returns, there is </p><p>reasoned optimism among human rights activists that it will </p><p>become permanent.  As the law is rooted in the Hadith and a </p><p>similar law has passed muster in Egypt (and other Muslim </p><p>countries), Jordanian Islamists will have a harder time </p><p>challenging its legitimacy.  Currently, judges are only </p><p>allowing women in worst-case situations to obtain a divorce, </p><p>but, human rights activists hope, a more liberal </p><p>interpretation could develop over time.  In light of </p><p>Jordanian traditions and cultural norms, progress is likely </p><p>to be slow.  Nevertheless, this is a tangible step forward in </p><p>the development of legal options for abandoned or severely </p><p>abused Jordanian Muslim wives. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
