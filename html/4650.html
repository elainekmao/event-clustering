(U) This is an action request; please see para. 10. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary: PolOff met December 6 with Honduran MFA </p><p>Director General for Treaties Ivonne Bonilla to demarche </p><p>Bonilla on the 1988 maritime counterterrorism (CT) convention </p><p>and protocol and to get a status report on the GOH\'s slow </p><p>action on becoming a party to five international and two OAS </p><p>CT conventions, including the maritime convention and </p><p>protocol.  Bonilla claimed the crux of the problem was that </p><p>the MFA has not been able to obtain certified </p><p>Spanish-language copies of the conventions.  Post requests </p><p>immediate assistance from the Department, USUN, and USOAS to </p><p>obtain the necessary documents.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) PolOff met December 6 with Honduran MFA Director </p><p>General for Treaties Ivonne Bonilla to demarche Bonilla on </p><p>the maritime counterterrorism (CT) convention and protocol </p><p>(reftel) and to get a status report on the GOH\'s slow action </p><p>on becoming a party to international and regional CT </p><p>conventions. </p><p> </p><p>Honduras Currently Party to Only Five CT Conventions . . . </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) PolOff confirmed with Bonilla that the GOH is </p><p>currently only a party to the following five international </p><p>counterterrorism conventions: </p><p>-- 1963 Tokyo Convention on Offenses and Certain Other Acts </p><p>Committed Onboard Aircraft </p><p>-- 1970 Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful </p><p>Seizure of Aircraft </p><p>-- 1971 Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful </p><p>Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation </p><p>-- 1973 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes </p><p>Against Internationally Protected Persons, and </p><p>-- 1979 Convention Against the Taking of Hostages. </p><p> </p><p> . . . But About to Become a Party to Two More </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) PolOff congratulated Bonilla on the GOH taking action </p><p>to become a party to the: </p><p>-- 1997 Convention for the Suppression on Terrorist Bombings, </p><p>and </p><p>-- 1999 Convention on the Suppression of Financing of </p><p>Terrorism Crimes (signed by the GOH November 11, 2001). </p><p>The MFA had forwarded both to Congress in October, Congress </p><p>approved both in early November, and since then Congress and </p><p>the Executive Branch have been completing all the required </p><p>steps.  Two decrees are now awaiting publication in the "La </p><p>Gaceta," the Honduran version of the Federal Register, to </p><p>become official.  Bonilla was not sure if the decrees would </p><p>be published prior to the end of December. </p><p> </p><p>Two Down, Seven to Go </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) PolOff confirmed with Bonilla that the GOH is still </p><p>not/not a party to the following five international CT </p><p>conventions, including the two maritime conventions: </p><p>-- 1980 Convention on the Physical Protection on Nuclear </p><p>Materials </p><p>-- 1988 Convention for the Suppression on Unlawful Acts </p><p>Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA Convention) </p><p>-- 1988 Protocol for the Suppression on Unlawful Acts Against </p><p>the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental </p><p>Shelf (SUA Protocol) </p><p>-- 1988 Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of </p><p>Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation </p><p>-- 1991 Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for </p><p>the Purpose of Detection (signed by the GOH March 26, 1991). </p><p> </p><p>The GOH is not a party to the following two Organization of </p><p>American States (OAS) CT conventions either: </p><p>-- 1971 OAS Convention to Prevent and Punish the Acts of </p><p>Terrorism Taking the Form of Crimes Against Persons and </p><p>Related Extortion that are of International Significance </p><p>(signed by the GOH February 2, 1971) </p><p>-- 2002 OAS Convention to Prevent and Punish Acts of </p><p>Terrorism (signed by the GOH June 3, 2002). </p><p> </p><p>MFA Claims Lack of Spanish Versions Key to Delay </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Bonilla claimed that the GOH did want to be a member </p><p>to all of these conventions but complained that the MFA first </p><p>needed certified Spanish-language copies of the conventions </p><p>that would be suitable for forwarding to Congress for </p><p>consideration.  Bonilla said that she had asked Honduran </p><p>diplomatic missions to obtain certified Spanish-language </p><p>copies of the conventions but they had not done so to date. </p><p>She then showed PolOff drafts of letters from the Vice </p><p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Anibal Quinonez to the Honduran </p><p>Ambassadors/Consul Generals/PermReps in Berlin, London, </p><p>Montreal, Rome, the UN, and Vienna instructing them to obtain </p><p>the needed documents.  Bonilla said that the letters would be </p><p>sent shortly. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) PolOff offered to assist if possible and Bonilla </p><p>said that the MFA would greatly appreciate any USG assistance </p><p>on this issue, as she was not optimistic that her diplomatic </p><p>colleagues would obtain the necessary Spanish-language </p><p>versions.  PolOff noted that obtaining the necessary OAS </p><p>documents should not be difficult.  Bonilla agreed, but it </p><p>was clear that she had focused more on the international CT </p><p>conventions and was not very familiar with either OAS CT </p><p>convention.  Political Section Chief plans to call Honduran </p><p>OAS PermRep to urge him to take swift action to obtain the </p><p>documents. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Following the meeting PolOff sent Bonilla hyperlinks </p><p>to UN, OAS, IAEA, ICAO, and IMO websites on CT conventions </p><p>that included the English text and status of the conventions. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Action request for the Department, USUN, and USOAS: </p><p>Post requests assistance to obtain for the GOH certified </p><p>Spanish-language copies of the five international and two OAS </p><p>counterterrorism conventions mentioned previously.  Post </p><p>suggests that the documents be given to one or more of the </p><p>following: the Honduran Mission to the UN, the Honduran </p><p>Mission to the OAS, the Honduran Embassy, or pouched to Post </p><p>for delivery to the MFA. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Post point of contact is Deputy Political Chief </p><p>Derrick Olsen, IVG phone: 539-4394, phone: (504) 236-9320 </p><p>x4394, fax: (504) 238-4446, unclassified and classified </p><p>e-mail. </p><p> </p><p>Without USG Assistance, Delay Will Likely Continue </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Comment:  The GOH has been a good and reliable friend </p><p>of the U.S. on counterterrorism, both under former President </p><p>Flores and current President Maduro.  Maduro\'s government </p><p>hosted a major U.S. military counterterrorism exercise in </p><p>March and has quickly responded with freeze orders to all </p><p>U.S. requests regarding suspect terrorist bank accounts.  No </p><p>terrorist assets have been found in Honduran financial </p><p>institutions, to date.  However, the GOH still has not </p><p>designated a national coordinator for counterterrorism, filed </p><p>its national report in accordance with United Nations </p><p>Security Council Resolution 1373, and most of all, signed </p><p>and/or ratified the five outstanding international </p><p>conventions/protocols and two OAS conventions against </p><p>terrorism.  There is no high-level coordinated GOH effort to </p><p>ensure that the GOH rapidly becomes a party to these </p><p>conventions, and thus, the process has bogged down in the </p><p>bureaucracy over the issue of obtaining certified </p><p>Spanish-language copies of the conventions.  Post would </p><p>greatly appreciate Department, USUN, and USOAS assistance to </p><p>jump-start this moribund process.  End Comment. </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
