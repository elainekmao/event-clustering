<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 001510 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP FOR KELLY AND DALEY, AND DRL </p><p>USCINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, BM, Human Rights, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: GOB RELEASES 115 POLITICAL PRISONERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: The GOB released another 115 political </p><p>prisoners on November 21.  The NLD has received the names of </p><p>50 NLD members who were released as well as one other who </p><p>military intelligence mistakenly identified as an NLD member. </p><p> ICRC received all 115 names.  This brings the total number </p><p>of political prisoners released since the talks began between </p><p>the NLD and the government to about 550, of which more than </p><p>400 have been NLD members.  According to NLD spokesman U </p><p>Lwin, only about 110 NLD members remain in prison. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The National League for Democracy\'s spokesman, U Lwin, </p><p>told Poloff November 22 that his contacts in military </p><p>intelligence had provided him last night with a list of 51 </p><p>supposed NLD members who had been released as part of the </p><p>GOB\'s announced release of 115 political prisoners on </p><p>November 21.  According to U Lwin, 50 of the 51 were indeed </p><p>NLD members, though none were particularly high-ranking. </p><p>Most were "students" (actually individuals who were now 30 to </p><p>40 years old after spending years in prison), including the </p><p>one non-NLD member, who had been swept up with a group of NLD </p><p>members at the time of their original arrest.  Otherwise, the </p><p>group included only one member of an NLD state-wide executive </p><p>committee and \'two or three" township committee members. </p><p>None of the 16 NLD MPs were released; neither were any other </p><p>high profile prisoners (NLD or not) part of the release. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) U Lwin said that the latest releases, when completely </p><p>confirmed, would bring the total number of political </p><p>prisoners released since the start of the talks between Aung </p><p>San Suu Kyi and the military to about 550, of which more than </p><p>400 were members of the NLD.  Altogether, he said, there are </p><p>now only about 110 NLD members still in detention, though </p><p>that group includes many major figures, including U Win Tin </p><p>and the 16 NLD MPs. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) U Lwin noted that some of the press stories on the </p><p>releases stated that 57 NLD members had been released.  So </p><p>far as he knew, that was not true, but he feared that some </p><p>NLD members might have been offered their release, but </p><p>refused to sign the warning given every paroled prisoner. </p><p>That warning stated that released prisoners could be made to </p><p>serve the remainder of their sentences, if arrested again on </p><p>similar charges.  U Lwin said that the NLD had told the </p><p>prisoners that this was not a pledge of good behavior; it was </p><p>simply part of the procedures for release and that no </p><p>released prisoners had ever yet been re-arrested. </p><p>Nevertheless, some prisoners still refused to sign the </p><p>warning.  Hence his concern about the discrepancy in numbers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ICRC\'s protection officer, Christophe Hartmann, told </p><p>Poloff that ICRC had received a list of 115 prisoners who had </p><p>been released from various prisons throughout Burma on </p><p>November 21.  However, the released prisoners had not yet </p><p>checked in with ICRC.  Only when the prisoners had checked in </p><p>would ICRC be prepared to say that the full release had taken </p><p>place. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In this case, DCI, the Burmese public relations firm, </p><p>appears to have gotten its facts right.  Apparently, the GOB </p><p>did release 115 prisoners November 21 though it may take some </p><p>days to fully confirm that number.  According to U Lwin, the </p><p>release was probably timed to coincide with the UN\'s </p><p>consideration of the resolution on Burma and the upcoming </p><p>SAIS conference on Burma in Washington.  It may also have </p><p>been the first tranche of the 200 to 300 political prisoners </p><p>Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt told Razali the government may release </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>before the close of the year.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
