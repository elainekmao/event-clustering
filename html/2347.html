<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003288 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/30/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA\'S ELECTORAL LAW CONTROVERSY CONTINUES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 3228 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 3280 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews.  Reason:  1.5(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  President Obasanjo denies having added an </p><p>unpopular clause to the Election Law, asserting that some </p><p>legislators inserted the language after he had noted its </p><p>absence.  A senior legislator privately conceded the point, </p><p>commenting that the legislators had grossly exceeded their </p><p>mandate.  He thought Obasanjo would have to accept deletion </p><p>of the clause, but public comments suggest Nigeria\'s Head of </p><p>State is not yet there.  If Obasanjo is conciliatory, it will </p><p>be good for Nigeria\'s nascent democracy.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Using his monthly radio program to respond to the </p><p>Nigerian Senate\'s rejection of the law intended to govern the </p><p>2003 electoral cycle (ref A), President Obasanjo said that he </p><p>had not inserted the unpopular Clause 80.1.  This clause </p><p>requires any party other than the three registered now (PDP, </p><p>APP and AD) to prove itself at the local level before </p><p>contesting state and federal positions.  As other parts of </p><p>the law extend the tenure of local governments from 2002 </p><p>until 2003 and establish that local government elections will </p><p>be held after state and national contests, Clause 80.1 denies </p><p>any of the several new parties an opportunity to participate </p><p>in state or national elections before 2007.  The clause drew </p><p>scathing public attacks from dozens of prominent Nigerians. </p><p>Even within the ruling PDP, there were many with strong </p><p>reservations.  When it recently emerged (ref B) that Clause </p><p>80.1 had not featured in the version of the law passed by the </p><p>National Assembly and sent to the President for signature, </p><p>the pressure grew stronger. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The Senate met in a special session on December 28 </p><p>and took the position that Obasanjo had not acted on the bill </p><p>sent to him December 5.  Since the 1999 Constitution gives </p><p>him 30 days to act, Senator Idris Abubakar pointed out during </p><p>debate, all the President need do is sign the bill that </p><p>originally came to him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Obasanjo December 29 publicly absolved himself of </p><p>having made a line-item amendment.  He said that he had </p><p>simply called the attention of five members of the conference </p><p>committee to the omission from the bill of a clause endorsed </p><p>by the ruling PDP.  The conferees had, Obasanjo continued, </p><p>asked him to send a letter stating his objections.  They had </p><p>then adjourned to the home of Works and Housing Minister Tony </p><p>Anenih, Obasanjo said, adding, "What transpired there I would </p><p>not know."  In the evening, the President concluded, the </p><p>legislators returned with a new version of the law.  It </p><p>incorporated a requirement (Clause 80.1) that parties seeking </p><p>to contest state or national elections must first obtain ten </p><p>percent of the seats in local government councils (spread </p><p>across two-thirds of the states).  Obasanjo noted that this </p><p>was a lower hurdle than the 15 percent threshold the PDP </p><p>caucus had agreed upon, but that he signed that second </p><p>version.  Members of the House of Representatives December 30 </p><p>argued that it was Senate President Anyim rather than Na\'Abba </p><p>who had inserted the controversial clause. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment:  The President may conceivably have so </p><p>misunderstood constitutional requirements that he truly </p><p>thought a few members of the conference committee had the </p><p>authority to amend a bill after passage without submitting </p><p>the change for ratification.  A senior legislator privately </p><p>confirmed December 29 that the President\'s account was </p><p>basically correct and said he could not understand how the </p><p>conference committee members had so grossly exceeded their </p><p>mandate.  Whether it was Anyim or Na\'Abba or some other </p><p>legislator who inserted Clause 80.1 matters little:  Five </p><p>legislators and some Villa officials (perhaps including the </p><p>President) flouted Constitutional requirements to get the </p><p>result they wanted.  The kindest conclusion one might draw is </p><p>that the legislators realized they had indeed forgotten to </p><p>include a passage that the party in control of both houses </p><p>wanted and rationalized the change as a technical fix that </p><p>would be broadly acceptable.  The Nigerian public may be less </p><p>generous, however, since the redrafting took place at the </p><p>home of Anenih, notorious as a political fixer.  Obasanjo has </p><p>long disliked Na\'Abba and probably relished telling his </p><p>listeners that the House Speaker was among the legislators </p><p>who adjourned to Anenih\'s house. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment Continued:  If the President now recognizes </p><p>that the electoral law he signed is politically unviable and </p><p>accepts deletion of Clause 80.1, the controversy that has </p><p>bedeviled politics here for the past two weeks may prove </p><p>beneficial to Nigeria\'s nascent democracy.  A clear object </p><p>lesson in the importance of proper democratic procedure will </p><p>have been delivered:  It does not suffice for backroom </p><p>consensus to have been achieved; debate must take place in </p><p>public, and individual politicians must accept accountability </p><p>for their positions, not hide behind cloakroom consensus. </p><p>One of the most positive elements of the Senate\'s special </p><p>session was the Senators\' decision to vote down a request for </p><p>executive session, thereby leaving their deliberations open </p><p>to journalists and cameras. </p><p>7.  (C) Comment Continued:  Obasanjo\'s remarks to reporters </p><p>about the Senate action ("Oh, they have rejected the Act. </p><p>That is their own prerogative.  I am just hearing it now. </p><p>You are just telling me now.") are unfortunately reminiscent </p><p>of previous incidents of Executive-Legislative conflict where </p><p>the President continued to advocate his position despite </p><p>Constitutional questions.  He has often prevailed, with other </p><p>participants in the political process left licking their </p><p>wounds.  To paraphrase the senior legislator, Obasanjo is </p><p>essential to Nigerian democracy now because there is no other </p><p>person combining the (military) seniority to face down the </p><p>generals and the government experience (previously Head of </p><p>State) to crack the whip over unruly civilian politicians </p><p>when it occasionally becomes necessary.  However, the senior </p><p>legislator added, Obasanjo\'s experience, seniority and </p><p>obduracy often make him too attentive to sycophants and lead </p><p>him to reject compromise, especially with people so junior to </p><p>him in years and experience. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Comment Concluded:  If Obasanjo is to complete the </p><p>democratic transition he began, he must gradually learn to </p><p>compromise with elected politicians.  This electoral law </p><p>could be a test case.  There is much at stake, but less than </p><p>many might claim.  Assuming present trends continue for </p><p>another six to nine months, the PDP will dominate the 2003 </p><p>election cycle.  But Clause 80.1 would increase its dominance </p><p>by excluding energetic new challengers in some places where </p><p>the PDP ran strongly in 1999 but has since weakened.  For </p><p>that very reason, the deletion of Clause 80.1 would be good </p><p>for the growth of democracy here, and correspondingly bad for </p><p>the interests of certain incumbents.  Obasanjo will need to </p><p>balance his interest in satisfying them and his own innate </p><p>stubbornness against the imperatives of greater political </p><p>transparency, respect for process, and responsiveness to </p><p>public opinion. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
