<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000540 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/RA AND IO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, NP, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY REVIEW OF NEPAL\'S UN COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 11645 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL/ECON:PMAHONEY.  REASON 1.5(B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The Embassy has reviewed the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) report on its implementation of UNSCR 1373.  For many </p><p>of its responses, the GON cites the Terrorism and Disruptive </p><p>Activities Ordinance (TADO), which has not yet been passed by </p><p>Parliament and which narrowly interprets terrorism as acts of </p><p>damage or destruction that undermine the sovereignty, peace, </p><p>or security of the Kingdom of Nepal.  The TADO is directed at </p><p>containing a violent domestic Maoist insurgency whose </p><p>partisans seek to overthrow the constitutional monarchy. </p><p>Virtually all of Nepal\'s limited security, law enforcement, </p><p>and intelligence facilities are likewise focused on </p><p>containing this domestic insurgency.  Because implementation </p><p>of existing laws and regulations--whether related to </p><p>terrorism or not--is generally weak and ineffective, we </p><p>caution that adoption of new legislation does not necessarily </p><p>imply greater ability to address potential acts of terrorism. </p><p> We do not question the GON\'s willingness to fight </p><p>international terrorism; we question only its capacity to do </p><p>so. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Response to Operative Paragraph 1: </p><p>The GON has not taken any legislative steps--other than </p><p>prohibiting extortion or robbery under the TADO--to suppress </p><p>the financing of terrorist acts.  However, as we have passed </p><p>on successive lists of organizations and individuals </p><p>proscribed in Executive Order 13224, the GON, through its </p><p>Central Bank, has routinely acted quickly to circulate that </p><p>information, along with instructions to freeze any accounts </p><p>of customers discovered to be on the lists, to commercial </p><p>banks and other financial institutions.  We are unaware of </p><p>any other action--other than passing on this information at </p><p>our request--that the GON has undertaken on its own </p><p>initiative in this regard.  Officials at the Ministry of </p><p>Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Central Bank tell </p><p>us that no such accounts have been identified, and express </p><p>general doubt, given the size of the economy and the limited </p><p>nature of the banking system, that Nepal is a channel for </p><p>terrorist financing.  If such accounts were identified, the </p><p>Central Bank could, under existing regulations, freeze them. </p><p>The Ministry of Finance has told us that it is not currently </p><p>contemplating any new legislation to strengthen existing </p><p>controls against terrorist financing.  In general, our sense </p><p>is that, if confronted by another friendly government with </p><p>compelling evidence of terrorist financing, the GON would </p><p>gladly cooperate but is unlikely to initiate such an </p><p>investigation or discover such evidence on its own. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Operative Paragraph 2 (sub-paragraph a): </p><p>No existing legislation specifically prohibits recruitment by </p><p>terrorist organizations, other than broad prohibitions </p><p>against terrorist activities in the TADO.  The Arms and </p><p>Ammunition Act restricts the use and availability of </p><p>firearms, but Nepal\'s inability to police its lengthy border </p><p>with India and Tibet makes the smuggling of weapons </p><p>comparatively easy.  Despite the report\'s claim that </p><p>"mechanisms to share information . . . with countries in the </p><p>region" are in place, we note that GON officials often </p><p>complain that their Indian counterparts fail to cooperate and </p><p>share information on Nepali Maoist insurgents believed to be </p><p>living and/or traveling in India.  There is no institutional </p><p>culture of intelligence sharing among the various security </p><p>forces within the GON, as well as none between the civilian </p><p>government and the military, a shortcoming that the newly </p><p>established (March 8) National Security Council, comprised of </p><p>representatives of the military, police, Armed Police Force, </p><p>and domestic intelligence service, is the most recent attempt </p><p>to overcome. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Operative Paragraph 2 (sub-paragraphs b-f):  Despite </p><p>GON\'s best efforts to prevent such activities, Nepal\'s </p><p>territory has been used as a safe haven by terrorists. </p><p>Indian government officials routinely complain that Pakistani </p><p>terrorists use Nepal as a channel.  The GON has told us it </p><p>has assured India that, once provided with firm evidence of </p><p>such activities, the GON will take immediate action.  In </p><p>fact, the GON has expelled three Pakistan Embassy staff </p><p>members since 2000, reportedly for possession of explosives </p><p>and/or counterfeit currency.  Nepal has cooperated with the </p><p>United States and India to render or extradite suspected </p><p>terrorists. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Operative Paragraph 2 (sub-paragraph g):  Border </p><p>controls between India and Nepal are lax.  At present, the </p><p>GON does not require any documentation from Indian citizens </p><p>crossing into Nepal by land, although bilateral discussions </p><p>are currently underway, according to the head of the </p><p>Immigration Department, to institute such requirements. </p><p>Indian citizens arriving by air may present a citizenship </p><p>certificate, driver\'s license, or a certification from their </p><p>local District Administration Office, in lieu of a passport. </p><p>Indian citizens may stay in Nepal indefinitely.  There are </p><p>only 15 customs checkpoints along the border with India where </p><p>goods and luggage are checked.  Indian citizens may also </p><p>cross at numerous other points, which are manned only by </p><p>police posts unequipped to check the integrity of travel </p><p>documents.  The Immigration Department maintains a watchlist </p><p>of individuals--including, presumably, known terrorists--to </p><p>be denied entry into the country, but only immigration </p><p>officials at the international airports have access to this </p><p>database.  Nepali citizenship certificates, driver\'s </p><p>licenses, and District Administration Office certificates </p><p>contain no security features and could easily be forged, </p><p>according to an immigration official. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Operative Paragraph 3:  Nepal has generally </p><p>demonstrated a willingness to be as helpful as possible in </p><p>combating terrorism, despite its limited capacity and </p><p>resources.  The GON tells us it is actively reviewing the six </p><p>remaining Counter-terrorism Conventions it has not yet </p><p>signed; review of the International Convention for the </p><p>Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism appears to be the </p><p>farthest along.  Nepal has not acceded to the UN Refugee </p><p>Convention and has no domestic laws related to refugees, and </p><p>thus has no legislative framework under which to address the </p><p>question of the abuse of refugee status by terrorists.  In </p><p>Nepal, refugee cases are handled under an informal agreement </p><p>with UNHCR. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
