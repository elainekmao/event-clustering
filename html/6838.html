<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HALIFAX 0091 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ASEC, KPAO, CA, US, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT:  CANADIAN PUBLIC OPINION ON THE IRAQ WAR: </p><p>THE VIEW FROM ATLANTIC CANADA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HALIFAX 0086 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) CANADIANS IN THE ATLANTIC PROVINCES, MOST OF WHOM </p><p>CONSIDER THEMSELVES TO HAVE A STAUNCHLY PRO-U.S. WORLD VIEW ON </p><p>MOST ISSUES, ARE DEEPLY DIVIDED OVER THE WAR IN IRAQ.   IN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS DURING THE PAST WEEK WITH A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE </p><p>INCLUDING THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>MINISTERS, LOCAL NEWSPAPER EDITORS, A POLITICAL POLLSTER, </p><p>BUSINESSPEOPLE, AND SOME OF OUR KEY MILITARY CONTACTS HERE, CG </p><p>HAS GOTTEN THE IMPRESSION OF A PROFOUNDLY CONFLICTED PUBLIC. </p><p>HALIFAX AND OTHER KEY ATLANTIC CITIES HAVE FAIRLY VOCAL STUDENT </p><p>GROUPS AT THE MAJOR UNIVERSITIES WHICH HAVE BEEN OUTSPOKEN IN </p><p>CRITICIZING THE WAR, AND WHICH HAVE ORGANIZED A NUMBER OF ANTI- </p><p>WAR DEMONSTRATIONS (REFTEL) SINCE THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN STARTED. </p><p>BUT THESE DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE ONLY DRAWN PROTESTERS IN THE </p><p>HUNDREDS, NOT THE THOUSANDS OR EVEN TENS OF THOUSANDS THAT HAVE </p><p>MARCHED ACROSS OTHER, LARGER CANADIAN CITIES.   OF COURSE, </p><p>HALIFAX IS A MEDIUM-SIZED PROVINCIAL TOWN WITH A SMALLER </p><p>POPULATION THAN TORONTO OR MONTREAL, BUT THE LUKEWARM RESPONSE </p><p>TO THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT REFLECTS DEEPER EMOTIONS HERE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) OUR CONTACTS SAY THAT MOST ATLANTIC CANADIANS HAVE </p><p>SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT ANY POLICY POSITION DICTATED FROM </p><p>OTTAWA THAT PUTS CANADA AT ODDS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  THIS </p><p>PART OF CANADA IS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT IT HAS CLOSE TIES OF </p><p>HISTORY, FAMILY, TRADE, AND CULTURE TO THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED </p><p>STATES.  ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE SHARE THE ANTI-WAR ACTIVISTQSQ </p><p>CONCERNS OVER THE UTILITY AND TIMING OF THIS MILITARY CAMPAIGN </p><p>AND OVER THE PERCEPTION THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS ACTING </p><p>UNILATERALLY WITHOUT U.N. SANCTION, A STRONG CURRENT WITHIN </p><p>LOCAL OPINION MAINTAINS THAT, NOW THAT THE WAR HAS BEGUN, FOR </p><p>BETTER OR WORSE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CANADA TO STAND BESIDE ITS </p><p>U.S. ALLY.  MANY ATLANTIC CANADIANS BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES OVER WHETHER TO INITIATE </p><p>MILITARY ACTION WAS ESSENTIALLY A DISPUTE OVER TACTICS, NOT OVER </p><p>THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF ENDING THE INTERNATIONAL THREAT POSED BY AN </p><p>OUTLAW REGIME IN BAGHDAD.    TACTICAL DIFFERENCES, THEY ARGUE, </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE THE CAUSE A SERIOUS RIFT BETWEEN TWO LONGSTANDING </p><p>PARTNERS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) AMBASSADOR CELLUCCIQS PUBLIC REMARKS YESTERDAY TO THE </p><p>EFFECT THAT AMERICANS ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH CANADAQS FAILURE TO </p><p>SUPPORT THE WAR HAVE GIVEN MANY ATLANTIC CANADIANS A JOLT. </p><p>ALTHOUGH SOME DO APPEAR TO FEEL INSULTED AT SUCH CRITICISM, MANY </p><p>OF OUR CONTACTS HAVE QUIETLY TOLD US THAT THEY BELIEVE THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR WAS RIGHT TO EXPRESS HIS CONCERNS AND TO WARN OF THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MIGHT BE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES IN THE </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.   WHILE PEOPLE HERE ARE WORRIED ABOUT </p><p>THE RAMIFICATIONS OF U.S. ACTIONS, THERE IS ALSO A PALPABLE </p><p>DISCONTENTMENT WITH THE ACTIONS AND STATEMENTS OF PM CHRETIEN </p><p>AND HIS GOVERNMENT.    ATLANTIC CANADIANS BELIEVE THAT CROSS- </p><p>BORDER COMMERCE AND TOURISM ARE VITAL TO THIS REGION, AND MANY </p><p>FEAR THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ADOPTING POSITIONS THAT </p><p>COULD JEOPARDIZE THESE ESSENTIAL BILATERAL RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> 5. (SBU) PUBLIC OPINION IN THE ATLANTIC PROVINCES TENDS TO BE </p><p>MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN ELSEWHERE IN CANADA, PARTLY BECAUSE </p><p>HALIFAX IS HOME TO THE CANADIAN NAVYQS ATLANTIC FLEET AND TO </p><p>MANY MILITARY FAMILIES WHICH HOLD THE U.S. MILITARY FORCES IN </p><p>HIGH REGARD.  REAR ADMIRAL GLENN DAVIDSON, COMMANDER OF CANADIAN </p><p>NAVAL FORCES HERE, CONFIDED TO CG TODAY THAT THERE IS FAIRLY </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE WAR WITHIN THE MILITARY SERVICES.  MANY </p><p>OF HIS NAVY OFFICERS AND ENLISTED PERSONNEL FEEL THAT THEY </p><p>SHOULD BE PART OF THE WAR EFFORT.  ACCORDING TO RADM DAVIDSON, </p><p>THE CANADIAN MILITARY ATTACHES THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE TO </p><p>DEVELOPING ITS "INTEROPERABILITY" AND COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. </p><p>MILITARY SERVICES, AND MANY MILITARY PEOPLE HERE FEAR THAT </p><p>CANADAQS REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE IN IRAQ WILL DAMAGE THAT CLOSE </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP IN THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) THE HEAD OF A WELL-ESTABLISHED PUBLIC OPINION POLLING </p><p>ORGANIZATION IN NOVA SCOTIA TOLD CG THAT A MAJORITY OF CANADIANS </p><p>IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY ARE PREPARED TO SET ASIDE THEIR </p><p>QUALMS ABOUT THE U.S. DECISION AND ARE LEANING TOWARDS SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE U.S. WAR EFFORT, NOW THAT HOSTILITIES HAVE BEGUN.  IN </p><p>HIS VIEW, OTTAWA COULD EASILY MOVE PUBLIC OPINION IN THIS </p><p>DIRECTION IF IT CHOSE TO DO SO.  HE COMMENTED THAT THERE MAY BE </p><p>MORE PRO-U.S. SENTIMENT IN OTHER PARTS OF CANADA THAN CURRENTLY </p><p>APPEARS TO BE CASE, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL BECAUSE THOSE </p><p>OPPOSED TO THE WAR TEND TO SPEAK THE LOUDEST AND GET THE MOST </p><p>MEDIA ATTENTION. </p><p>KASHKETT </p><p></p></div>
