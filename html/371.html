<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 04144 </p><p> </p><p>ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p>JERUSALEM FOR LEAF </p><p>USIA FOR NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, PINS, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  SADDAM\'S THREAT HELPS PULL KUWAITIS TOGETHER </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A) FBIS LD2007205690 (NOTAL), </p><p>-      (B) 89 KUWAIT 6293 (NOTAL) </p><p>-      (C) TUNIS 7242 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  IRAQI THREATS HAVE HAD THE EFFECT OF </p><p>UNIFYING SOME KUWAITI LEFTISTS AND POLITICAL OPPOSITION </p><p>SUPPORTERS BEHIND THE GOK.  THE LEFTIST KUWAIT TRADE </p><p>UNION FEDERATION (KTUF), IN A JULY 20 STATEMENT, </p><p>DENOUNCED IRAQI ALLEGATIONS AS TANTAMOUNT TO A DIRECT </p><p>MILITARY ACTION AGAINST KUWAIT AND CALLED FOR DIALOGUE </p><p>BETWEEN IRAQ AND KUWAIT.  DR. AHMED AL-RUBIE, A LEADING </p><p>"GROUP OF 32" POLITICAL OPPOSITION MEMBER KNOWN FOR HIS </p><p>MARXIST BELIEFS AND ANTI-GOVERNMENT RHETORIC, </p><p>EDITORIALIZED IN AL-WATAN JULY 21 THAT, WHEN IT COMES TO </p><p>THE ISSUE OF KUWAIT\'S NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, "PEOPLE ARE </p><p>NOT DIVIDED BETWEEN RULERS AND RULED, BUT WOULD RATHER </p><p>MANIFEST A UNIFIED NATIONAL KUWAITI UNANIMITY."  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  IN A JULY 20 STATEMENT CARRIED BY THE KUWAIT </p><p>STATE NEWS AGENCY (KUNA) AND REF A FBIS REPORT, THE </p><p>KUWAIT TRADE UNION FEDERATION (KTUF) DENOUNCED IRAQI </p><p>ALLEGATIONS AGAINST KUWAIT AS "TANTAMOUNT TO DIRECT </p><p>MILITARY ACTION."  THE STATEMENT ASSERTED, "WE ARE NOT </p><p>HERE TO RECALL EITHER THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE EXTENDED </p><p>BY KUWAIT OR THE SACRIFICES INCURRED BY THE KUWAITI </p><p>PEOPLE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THIS IS OUR NATIONAL </p><p>OBLIGATION AND WE REFRAIN FROM REMINDING BROTHERS OF </p><p>WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR THEM."  THE KTUF CALLED FOR </p><p>"SINCERE" DIALOGUE ON OIL ISSUES AND DEMARCATION AND </p><p>QUESTIONED WHY IRAQ HAD SETTLED BORDER ISSUES WITH </p><p>JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA DURING THE GULF WAR, BUT NOT </p><p>WITH KUWAIT.  THE STATEMENT CONCLUDED WITH A CALL TO </p><p>"JOIN FORCES AGAINST OUR COMMON ENEMY.  LET ALL GUNS AND </p><p>MISSILES BE AIMED AT THOSE WHO KILL PALESTINIAN </p><p>CHILDREN." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  KUWAIT UNIVERSITY PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR DR. </p><p>AHMED AL-RUBIE, IN A JULY 21 AL-WATAN (ARABIC, LEFTIST) </p><p>EDITORIAL, WROTE:  "IRAQ KNOWS THAT THE PROBLEM WHICH IT </p><p>RAISED HAS TO DO WITH THE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OF </p><p>KUWAIT.  IN SUCH ISSUES, PEOPLE ARE NOT DIVIDED BETWEEN </p><p>RULERS AND RULED, BUT WOULD RATHER MANIFEST A UNIFIED </p><p>NATIONAL KUWAITI UNANIMITY.  IF WE BELIEVE IN UNITY AS </p><p>AN ARAB DESTINY, IT IS NECESSARY THAT WE BEHAVE </p><p>EQUITABLY, FOR THERE IS NO SMALL ARAB AND NO BIG ARAB OR </p><p>STRONG ARAB AND WEAK ARAB.  ALSO, WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND </p><p>THAT NOBODY CAN REALIZE HIS INTERESTS AT THE EXPENSE OF </p><p>OTHERS." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT.  BOTH THE KTUF AND AL-RUBIE, WHO IS </p><p>CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE KTUF, ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR </p><p>ANTI-GOVERNMENT, LEFTIST RHETORIC (REF B).  THE </p><p>HARVARD-EDUCATED AL-RUBIE IS DESCRIBED AS A MARXIST AND </p><p>IS ONE OF THE MORE RADICAL MEMBERS OF THE "GROUP OF 32" </p><p>EX-PARLIAMENT DEPUTIES, WHO FORM THE CORE OF KUWAIT\'S </p><p>POLITICAL OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE </p><p>RECENTLY-CREATED NATIONAL COUNCIL.  THE SUPPORT WHICH </p><p>BOTH THE KTUF AND AL-RUBIE HAVE EXPRESSED FOR THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS, THEREFORE, SIGNIFICANT.  AS THE KUWAITI </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO TUNIS NOTED IN REF C, SADDAM IS MAKING A </p><p>MISTAKE IF HE THINKS HE CAN EXPLOIT POLITICAL </p><p>DIFFERENCES IN KUWAIT.  IF ANYTHING, THE CRISIS WILL </p><p>PROBABLY HELP TO UNIFY KUWAIT\'S VARIOUS POLITICAL AND </p><p>SOCIAL GROUPINGS FULLY BEHIND THE AMIR.  WE EXPECT THAT </p><p>IF AL-RUBIE HAS ALREADY CHIMED IN, IT WON\'T BE LONG </p><p>BEFORE OTHER OPPOSITION MEMBERS OF FAR LESS RADICAL </p><p>VIEWPOINTS, POSSIBLY INCLUDING CHAMBER OF COMMERCE </p><p>CHAIRMAN ABDULAZIZ AL-SAGER, WILL BE PRESSURED TO MAKE </p><p>SIMILAR STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOWELL </p><p></p></div>
