(SBU) Summary.  A joint delegation from the Departments </p><p>of Labor and State emphasized June 17-19 the need for the </p><p>GOH to increase its protection of labor rights and for the </p><p>private sector to augment its respect for labor rights, with </p><p>U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) soon </p><p>opening the door to greater U.S.-Honduran trade and </p><p>investment.  The visit focused attention on problems in the </p><p>Ministry of Labor\'s enforcement of labor laws and </p><p>regulations, possible reform of the labor code, difficulties </p><p>with exercising the rights to organize and bargain </p><p>collectively, and efforts to eliminate the worst forms of </p><p>child labor.  The U.S. delegation pressed the MOL and the </p><p>private sector to be more aggressive in addressing the </p><p>problems that exist, even if longer-term structural changes </p><p>in the labor code are not politically possible in the short </p><p>term.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) A USG delegation led by Jorge Perez-Lopez, Director </p><p>of the Office of International Economic Affairs in the </p><p>Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) at the </p><p>Department of Labor, and also including Arlen Wilson, Deputy </p><p>Director of the Office of International Labor Affairs in the </p><p>Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL/IL) at the </p><p>Department of State, and Carlos Romero, International </p><p>Economist at ILAB in DOL, held a series of bilateral labor </p><p>consultations June 17-19 in Tegucigalpa on the margins of </p><p>the fifth round of negotiations for the U.S.-Central America </p><p>Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).  LabAtt accompanied the </p><p>delegation to all meetings. </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Labor/Ministry of Commerce and Industry </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The USG delegation met June 17 with Vice Minister of </p><p>Labor (MOL) Angel Escobar and Vice Minister of Industry and </p><p>Trade Irving Guererro, as well as Honduran CAFTA labor </p><p>negotiator Jorge Ponce.  Minister of Labor German Leitzelar </p><p>was in Geneva for the International Labor Organization (ILO) </p><p>meetings and was unable to take part in the meeting. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) VM Escobar, himself a former leader of the Honduran </p><p>beer company\'s employees\' union, said that the MOL has good </p><p>relations with labor.  Perez-Lopez inquired about the labor </p><p>rights situation in Honduras and asked about the still </p><p>pending revisions to the Labor Code.  VM Escobar said that </p><p>the GOH had written a draft law in 1995 but it never came to </p><p>a vote in Congress and has been frozen ever since.  The MOL </p><p>was now working again on drafting a revised Labor Code, with </p><p>approximately 15 percent of the draft law still under </p><p>tripartite (GOH, Labor, business) negotiation under the </p><p>mandate of the GOH\'s Economic and Social Council.  He noted </p><p>that the GOH had recently reformed articles 43-45 covering </p><p>Honduran workers overseas and said the MOL hoped to make </p><p>more changes to specific articles if the whole law could not </p><p>be reformed.  Romero raised the 1995 Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding between USTR and the MOL in the context of </p><p>improvements in worker rights that still needed to be made. </p><p>Key aspects of this MOU could be vehicles for change through </p><p>administrative action. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) VM Escobar noted a lack of funds and staff severely </p><p>hampered what the MOL was able to do.  He said the MOL was </p><p>improving the level of coverage, including inspectors, in </p><p>the San Pedro Sula area where most economic activity </p><p>(including export processing manufacturing (maquilas)) is </p><p>concentrated.  He noted that the problem of child labor had </p><p>been successfully eradicated in the maquila sector and said </p><p>that while there were some labor problems with maquilas, </p><p>they were generally not with U.S.-owned maquilas.  In fact, </p><p>MOL and union officials have previously told EmbOffs that </p><p>U.S.-owned maquilas have taken a leadership role in making </p><p>positive changes on labor issues in the industry. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Perez-Lopez noted that perception in the U.S. could </p><p>be as important as reality in Honduras and cautioned there </p><p>were still ongoing labor rights problems that needed to be </p><p>addressed as soon as possible, especially given the ongoing </p><p>negotiation of CAFTA that includes a chapter on protecting </p><p>labor rights.  Specifically Perez-Lopez and Romero </p><p>mentioned: </p><p>-- the lack of reinstatement of workers unjustly fired for </p><p>labor activities (as well as the alleged use of blacklists </p><p>by maquila owners), </p><p>-- leaks to management of lists of union supporters forming </p><p>a union that leads to the subsequent unjust dismissal of </p><p>these employees, and </p><p>-- complaints raised in reports by the AFL-CIO and the </p><p>Department of State\'s Human Rights Report about general </p><p>difficulties with the right to organize and bargain </p><p>collectively, especially in the maquila sector. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) VM Escobar said the MOL works directly with maquila </p><p>owners and workers to resolve problems and the San Pedro </p><p>Sula office continued to inspect maquilas and conduct </p><p>alternative conflict resolution training.  VM Escobar noted </p><p>that the lack of money for inspectors was a serious problem; </p><p>Perez-Lopez agreed this was a real problem and also noted </p><p>that low salaries for inspectors left them more susceptible </p><p>to corruption.  Perez-Lopez explained that USG assistance on </p><p>labor issues could not be used for inspectors\' salaries; VM </p><p>Escobar replied that neither could World Bank money, which </p><p>limited MOL options because of the tight overall government </p><p>budget. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Escobar and Ponce clarified the issue of </p><p>solidarity/employee associations, saying that they had no </p><p>standing under Honduran law and that while an employer could </p><p>form one it would not prevent the establishment of a union. </p><p>MOL officials noted that there could only be one union per </p><p>company and that by law it took 30 employees to form a </p><p>union.  Once a union is recognized and receives its </p><p>"personeria juridica" (legal standing) from the MOL, by law </p><p>the employer is obligated to negotiate a collective </p><p>bargaining agreement if the union presents a list of issues </p><p>to negotiate.  (Note:  In reality, getting a Honduran </p><p>employer to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement can </p><p>be a serious challenge in the current labor rights </p><p>environment in Honduras.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Perez-Lopez highlighted the USG\'s interest in </p><p>eliminating the worst forms of child labor and noted that </p><p>DOL was funding a number of ILO International Program to </p><p>Eradicate Child Labor (IPEC) projects in Honduras, including </p><p>in coffee and melon sectors, as well as in the commercial </p><p>sexual exploitation of children.  (Romero and LabAtt also </p><p>had a breakfast meeting June 19 with ILO/IPEC Coordinator </p><p>Paulino Isidoro and IPEC melon project coordinator Martha </p><p>Chavez to discuss DOL-funded IPEC projects.  Isidoro and </p><p>Chavez said they had seen a marked improvement in the </p><p>private sector\'s approach to the problem of child labor. </p><p>The IPEC program was now granted access to melon farms and </p><p>processing plants in the Department of Choluteca and even </p><p>sugar cane owners had admitted there was a problem with </p><p>child labor in their sector -- where no IPEC project exists </p><p>-- and had pledged to move toward eliminating it.  Isidoro </p><p>noted that IPEC also had projects with child domestic </p><p>servants, child divers in the lobster industry, children </p><p>working in the tobacco industry, and children working in </p><p>garbage dumps in Tegucigalpa.)  While Honduras has made </p><p>strides against child labor in general, Isidoro noted that </p><p>child labor remains a pervasive problem, particularly </p><p>(although by no means exclusively) in commercial </p><p>agriculture. </p><p> </p><p>Labor Confederations: CGT and CTH </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The USG delegation hosted a meeting at the Embassy </p><p>June 17 with representatives of the General Workers\' Central </p><p>(CGT), affiliated with the World Congress of Labor (WCL) and </p><p>led by Secretary General Daniel Duron, and the Confederation </p><p>of Honduran Workers (CTH), affiliated with the International </p><p>Congress of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).  The third Honduran </p><p>labor confederation, the United Confederation of Honduran </p><p>Workers (CUTH), led by SecGen Israel Salinas and applying </p><p>for affiliation with the ICFTU, was invited, but Salinas was </p><p>unable to attend the meeting and the other CUTH </p><p>representatives did not show up.  Wilson, Romero, and LabAtt </p><p>also had lunch June 19 with CTH SecGen Dinora Aceituno, who </p><p>had been unable to attend the June 17 meeting. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Duron said that the CGT appreciated that labor </p><p>issues would be a key part of CAFTA and said that the CGT </p><p>wanted real protection for labor rights in the agreement. </p><p>Noting that only eight to 10 percent of the economically </p><p>active Honduran workforce is unionized, Duron said that it </p><p>was difficult to exercise the right of association in </p><p>Honduras, particularly in the maquila sector, where he </p><p>claimed only two percent of workers were unionized and had </p><p>collective bargaining agreements.  (Note:  Minister of Labor </p><p>Leitzelar told a Congressional StaffDel May 27 that the low </p><p>rate of unionization in Honduras was due to a variety of </p><p>factors and not necessarily an indicator of a lack of </p><p>freedom of association.  He said that of the 122,000 workers </p><p>in the maquila sector, 10 percent of female workers (11,000) </p><p>were unionized and two percent of male workers (2,500) were </p><p>unionized.  LabAtt is seeking updated statistics from the </p><p>MOL on the number of unions with collective bargaining </p><p>agreements in the maquila sector.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Duron said that it was common for businesses to fire </p><p>union organizers and that reinstatement of unjustly fired </p><p>workers seldom, if ever, occurs.  He noted that some </p><p>maquilas hired former MOL labor inspectors to work in their </p><p>human resources office.  Duron also explained that it was </p><p>not easy to move from registering an intent to organize a </p><p>union to getting a union\'s "personeria juridica" from the </p><p>MOL.  He outlined how maquilas used loyal employees to </p><p>"infiltrate" union organizers to provide information on them </p><p>to management that then led to the organizers being fired </p><p>unjustly.  Duron said that solidarity/employee associations </p><p>were not a major problem, and cautioned that the labor </p><p>unions were skeptical about proposed "flexibilization" of </p><p>the labor code.  Duron said unions were open to revision of </p><p>the labor code provided their previously hard-won labor </p><p>rights were preserved.  He said any reform process had to </p><p>balance the equities of workers, as well as employers </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Duron said that with the GOH still unable to reach </p><p>agreement with the International Monetary fund and 35 </p><p>percent unemployment (a MOL statistic), the Honduran economy </p><p>was in poor shape.  His affiliates were worried that it </p><p>would be very difficult to compete with the U.S. in </p><p>manufacturing or agriculture.  He criticized NAFTA and </p><p>claimed it had not reduced poverty in Mexico or the rate of </p><p>illegal Mexican immigration to the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Aceituno\'s statements were similar to Duron\'s </p><p>comments.  She cited the right of association and the right </p><p>to bargain collectively as the two most important labor </p><p>rights that were the most difficult to exercise in Honduras. </p><p>She complained about the unjust dismissal of union </p><p>organizers in maquilas and agreed that reinstatement was a </p><p>remedy in theory but not in practice, noting that the fine </p><p>for unjustly firing a worker was only 500 lempiras (less </p><p>than USD 29).  (Note:  Employers also have to pay severance </p><p>pay - see paragraph 17.  End Note.)  The delegation told </p><p>Duron and Aceituno they agreed that progress was needed on </p><p>the protection and respect of labor rights in Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>Private Sector: COHEP, Maquila Association, and others </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The USG delegation met June 17 with over a dozen </p><p>representatives of the private sector, including leaders of </p><p>the Honduran Council on Private Enterprise (COHEP), the </p><p>Honduran Apparel Manufacturers Association (the Maquila </p><p>Association), the National Association of Industrialists </p><p>(ANDI), and the National Federation of Cattlemen and </p><p>Agriculture of Honduras (FENAC) at COHEP.  Honduran </p><p>Ambassador to the U.S. Mario Canahuati and Maquila </p><p>Association President Jesus Canahuati (brothers) both </p><p>attended the meeting. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) Adolfo Facusse, ANDI President and a leading </p><p>businessman, emphasized that the majority of the workforce </p><p>was employed in the informal sector (52 percent according to </p><p>Minister of Labor Leitzelar).  He noted that COHEP and the </p><p>three labor confederations had agreed to labor code </p><p>revisions in the mid-1990s, but that the GOH delayed </p><p>introducing the revised code to Congress for a vote and that </p><p>the consensus had since broken down.  Reforming the labor </p><p>code remained a difficult political issue, despite the fact </p><p>that the current code was obsolete, according to the private </p><p>sector representatives.  Maquila Association representatives </p><p>said they wanted to see the union registration process </p><p>expedited and agreed with the need to reform that aspect of </p><p>the labor code. </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) Jesus Canahuati said that there were generally </p><p>harmonious labor/management relations in the maquila sector, </p><p>and noted the importance of bipartite (labor/management) and </p><p>tripartite (labor/management/GOH) discussions on labor </p><p>issues.  Canahuati said that of 180 maquilas, 66 had unions, </p><p>of which 48 were functioning, and many had collective </p><p>bargaining agreements (he did not have a precise number). </p><p>He said that unjustly fired workers can receive pay </p><p>equivalent to one month for every year worked (maximum 15 </p><p>months).  Jacobo Kattan, a maquila executive, admitted that </p><p>blacklists had been used in the early years of the maquilas </p><p>(1989-91), but claimed that now it hardly happened. </p><p>Canahuati said that to the best of the Maquila Association\'s </p><p>knowledge, blacklists are not used.  Canahuati said that the </p><p>maquila sector realized it had a large impact in Honduran </p><p>society and the economy.  The Association was open to </p><p>investigate any complaints about its members, said </p><p>Canahuati.  (Note:  After the meeting LabAtt gave Canahuati </p><p>the names of two maquilas that had been the subject of </p><p>recent complaints and asked him to investigate.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) COHEP President Jacobo Regalado said that COHEP was </p><p>working to combat child labor and noted the private sector </p><p>was working with the Ministry of Education to adjust the </p><p>school calendar so it did not conflict with the coffee </p><p>harvest, which in the past has led many parents to keep </p><p>their children out of school so they could help harvest </p><p>coffee beans.  Facusse noted that the poor state of public </p><p>education and repeated teacher strikes contributed to the </p><p>problem of child labor.  Canahuati stated that child labor </p><p>was not a problem in the maquila industry. </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) LabAtt noted that the two most numerous labor issues </p><p>he dealt with were complaints about the right to organize </p><p>and bargain collectively in maquilas and the problem of </p><p>child labor in commercial agriculture.  The USG delegation </p><p>emphasized the need for the private sector to make </p><p>improvements in both areas. </p><p> </p><p>Former Minister of Labor Gautama Fonseca </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) The USG delegation also had a breakfast meeting </p><p>June 18 with former Minister of Labor (and former Minister </p><p>of Public Security) Gautama Fonseca.  Fonseca noted the </p><p>problem of corruption hampered MOL efforts and said that </p><p>corruption, along with economic problems, had weakened the </p><p>labor movement.  He said that Minister of Labor Leitzelar </p><p>was a good minister but hampered by an under-funded and </p><p>understaffed ministry. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) Comment:  Honduras enjoys a fair reputation on </p><p>labor rights because of important advances in labor rights </p><p>made over the years.  Partially because of this, Honduras </p><p>has at times looked better than its Central American </p><p>neighbors (three of which face GSP petitions) with respect </p><p>to the provision of labor rights.  However this perception </p><p>is only partially consistent with the reality of labor </p><p>rights in this country.  There is still much work to be done </p><p>to meet international labor standards, as reflected in the </p><p>section on workers rights in the Human Rights Report. </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU) Comment continued.  The Honduran maquila sector </p><p>feels it faces unfair criticism given the achievements it </p><p>has made in eliminating child labor in maquilas, improving </p><p>occupational safety and health, and meeting demanding labor </p><p>codes of conduct established by U.S. buyers/retailers. </p><p>Since it is practically the only sector of the Honduran </p><p>economy that is rebounding from a post-September 11 downturn </p><p>and the largest source of non-agricultural employment in the </p><p>country, maquilas naturally remain the focus of labor </p><p>unions\' organizing efforts.  Those efforts combined with </p><p>continued resistance by some employers to the establishment </p><p>of unions has meant maquilas continue to be the subject of </p><p>complaints from Honduran and U.S. labor organizations/NGOs </p><p>regarding problems with freedom of association and </p><p>collective bargaining.  There are many steps the government, </p><p>private sector, and labor unions can undertake to improve on </p><p>these issues.  (Even Minister Leitzelar has noted that there </p><p>are a variety of other factors that also affect the ability </p><p>to organize new unions, including a weak economy in general </p><p>and internal problems within unions.) </p><p> </p><p>23. (SBU) Comment continued:  The paltry budget and staff of </p><p>the Ministry of Labor is a real impediment to improved </p><p>enforcement of labor laws, but the MOL could do more with </p><p>what it has.  The U.S. delegation pressed the MOL and the </p><p>private sector to be more aggressive in addressing the </p><p>problems that exist, even if longer-term structural changes </p><p>in the labor code are not politically possible in the short </p><p>term.  With DOL-funded technical assistance (on occupational </p><p>safety and health, rights of association/collective </p><p>bargaining) and IPEC projects, the MOL is already greatly </p><p>benefiting from a USG commitment to improve respect for </p><p>labor rights in Honduras.  It is now up to the GOH to </p><p>increase the MOL\'s capacity to protect labor rights and for </p><p>the private sector to address the remaining problems.  End </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>24. (U) This cable was cleared by DOL (ILAB) and State </p><p>(DRL/IL). </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
