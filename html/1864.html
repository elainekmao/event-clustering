(U) INDEPENDENT PRESS REPORTS INDICATE THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS RESHUFFLED HIS CABINET TO FILL </p><p>THREE POSITIONS LEFT VACANT BY THE DEATHS OF TWO </p><p>MINISTERS AND THE RESIGNATION OF ANOTHER.  THE OFFICIAL </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE ON STATE RADIO TODAY (AUGUST 9) </p><p>AFTER THE SWEARING-IN CEREMONY AT STATE HOUSE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) BELOW ARE THE NEW MINISTRY CHIEFS: </p><p> </p><p>-- DEFENSE:  MINES AND ENERGY MINISTER SYDNEY SEKERAMAYI </p><p>REPLACES ACTING DEFENSE MINISTER JOYCE MUJURU AND </p><p>PERMANENTLY FILLS THE POST LEFT VACANT BY THE DEATH OF </p><p>MOVEN MAHACHI. </p><p> </p><p>-- MINES AND ENERGY:  DEPUTY ENVIRONMENT MINISTER EDWARD </p><p>CHINDORI-CHININGA REPLACES SEKERAMAYI. </p><p> </p><p>-- YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, GENDER AND EMPLOYMENT CREATION: </p><p>NEWLY ELECTED BINDURA MP AND FORMER MASHONALAND CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNOR ELLIOT MANYIKA FILLS THE MINISTERIAL POSITION </p><p>LEFT OPEN BY THE DEATH OF BORDER GEZI. </p><p> </p><p>-- INDUSTRY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE:  ACTING INDUSTRY </p><p>MINISTER AND FORMER HIGHER EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY </p><p>MINISTER HERBERT MURERWA OFFICIALLY FILLS THE </p><p>MINISTERIAL SLOT VACATED BY NKOSANA MOYO, WHO RESIGNED </p><p>IN MARCH. </p><p> </p><p>-- HIGHER EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY:  FORMER EDUCATION </p><p>MINISTER SAMUEL MUMBENGEGWI REPLACES MURERWA. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02364  091346Z </p><p> </p><p>-- EDUCATION, SPORTS AND CULTURE:  DEPUTY EDUCATION </p><p>MINISTER AENEAS CHIGWEDERE MOVES INTO THE TOP POST, </p><p>REPLACING MUMBENGEGWI. </p><p> </p><p>3.

(C) COMMENT: PRESIDENT MUGABE HAD APPARENTLY WAITED </p><p>TO MAKE SURE ELLIOT MANYIKA WAS ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT </p><p>BEFORE ANNOUNCING HIS LONG-OVERDUE CABINET RESHUFFLE. </p><p>IT LOOKS LIKE MANYIKA IS ON THE FAST-TRACK TO IMPORTANT </p><p>THINGS IN GOVERNMENT AND THE RULING PARTY, FOLLOWING IN </p><p>LOCK-STEP THE METEORIC RISE OF BORDER GEZI.  THE ONLY </p><p>BIG SURPRISE IN THE RESHUFFLE IS THE APPOINTMENT OF </p><p>SEKERAMAYI AS DEFENSE MINISTER.  SEKERAMAYI IS AN OLD </p><p>RIVAL OF PRESIDENTIAL HEIR APPARENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, </p><p>AND AT ONE POINT HIS POLITICAL FUTURE APPEARED DIM.  HE </p><p>WAS SIDELINED AT MINES AND ENERGY TO MAKE WAY FOR </p><p>MNANGAGWA.  THE DEFENSE MINISTRY IS A SMALL STEP UP FOR </p><p>SEKERAMAYI, AND SINCE HE IS A FRIEND OF THE UNHAPPY </p><p>POWERBROKER SOLOMON MUJURU, SEKERAMAYI\'S APPOINTMENT MAY </p><p>INDICATE THAT MUGABE SEES A NEED TO PLACATE THE OLD </p><p>BARON.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
