<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001169 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 18/03/02 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, AO, ZI, CF, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA GENERAL MOHAMMED ON ANGOLA, CONGO AND </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5(B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During an April 3 meeting with National </p><p>Security Advisor, General (Rtd.) Aliyu Mohammed, to discuss </p><p>security assistance programs (SEPTEL), Ambassador Jeter </p><p>used the opportunity to engage the NSA on Angola, Congo and </p><p>Zimbabwe. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>ANGOLA </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador initiated the discussion by asking </p><p>the NSA whether the GON was involved behind the scenes in </p><p>the Angolan cease-fire agreement. Mohammed replied that the </p><p>GON was not involved; in fact explained that he was in </p><p>Saudi Arabia for the Hajj when Savimbi was killed. None the </p><p>less, said that President Obasanjo had spoken with Dos </p><p>Santos and told him that Savimbi\'s death was a great </p><p>opportunity to rebuild the country. Mohammed noted that </p><p>UNITA would always be symbolic of Savimbi\'s resistance to </p><p>Dos Santos and the rebels needed a face saving way out so </p><p>that they could appear to remain true to Savimbi\'s legacy </p><p>while also ending the war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The NSA also revealed that President Obasanjo had </p><p>sent Special Representative on Conflict Resolution, </p><p>Ambassador Raph Uwechue, to Angola. Mohammed said he was </p><p>pleased with the cease-fire and that amnesty had been given </p><p>to the rebels. He concluded, the situation looked hopeful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Congo: </p><p>------ </p><p>4. (C) The NSA was not optimistic about the Inter-Congolese </p><p>Dialogue (ICD), contending that nothing good would come of </p><p>it. He explained, there are too many players involved in </p><p>the ICD and it is impossible to get everyone to put their </p><p>selfish interests aside and work for peace. Mohammed </p><p>suggested that the solution requires key players to sit </p><p>down and hammer out a solution and that has not happened </p><p>yet. Until Museveni, Kabila, Mbeki and Mugabe reach a </p><p>consensus on peace, there will continue to be chaos in the </p><p>Congo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Zimbabwe: </p><p>--------- </p><p>5. (C) Mohammed summarized his thoughts on Zimbabwe by </p><p>saying that unlike the U.S. and Britain points of view, </p><p>Nigeria saw the Zimbabwe crisis as one over land ownership </p><p>and not politics. He insisted the Britain was biased which </p><p>opened their version of events to question. The NSA said </p><p>that the real problem was not Mugabe but lack of land </p><p>ownership by the Zimbabwean majority.  Meanwhile, Britain </p><p>was protecting the interests of the elite like the </p><p>publisher of the Financial Times and a former British </p><p>Foreign Minister Rifkind, both of whom had massive land </p><p>holdings in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Everyone agrees that greater land equity was </p><p>fundamental, the Ambassador replied, but the contest for </p><p>land did not legitimize election fraud and intimidation. </p><p>The NSA disagreed, asserting that the elections were </p><p>credible. Ambassador Jeter offered to provide reports to </p><p>substantiate his statement; the NSA rebutted by saying that </p><p>credibility depends on whose reports you read. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador told Mohammed that the US appreciated </p><p>what Nigeria was doing in Zimbabwe but did not recognize </p><p>the legitimacy of the elections. Moreover, given what had </p><p>happened during the recent poll it would be difficult to </p><p>have normal relations with the Mugabe government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Ambassador suggested that Mugabe gracefully step </p><p>aside for a transitional government since he had proven </p><p>that he can win an election by capitalizing on the land </p><p>issue. The NSA agreed that Mugabe should step down but </p><p>argued, if you pushed him too hard he would only enlarge </p><p>his following. Sanctions will not punish Mugabe only the </p><p>people of Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The NSA argued that Tsvangirai was not a viable </p><p>successor to Mugabe. Tsvangirai could not replace Mugabe </p><p>because he did not have the support of the National </p><p>institutions, including the civil service and the army. </p><p>Asked if he believed the charges of treason against </p><p>Tsvangirai, Mohammed said that he was uncertain but had </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>requested a copy of the alleged tape implicating the MDC </p><p>leader to see if it was authentic. Ambassador said that </p><p>from our perspective the charges against Tsvangirai are not </p><p>credible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Ambassador pointed out that the land issue was </p><p>bigger than Zimbabwe; there was a real fear that violence </p><p>over land redistribution could spread to South Africa and </p><p>Namibia and influence racial tensions throughout the </p><p>region. He said killings and seizures were not the answer, </p><p>citing Namibia\'s calling of a National conference on the </p><p>land problem as an example of addressing the issue </p><p>responsibly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Ambassador said that Nigeria\'s position on Zimbabwe </p><p>could have influence much beyond its borders, including </p><p>questions of Africa\'s commitment to the goals of NEPAD. </p><p>Mohammed exclaimed that these statements made African </p><p>countries feel they were being blackmailed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) The NSA said it seemed unfair for the U.S. to </p><p>criticize Zimbabwe\'s election when its own National </p><p>election had been irregular. In defense of the legitimacy </p><p>of the elections, the NSA said that Mugabe promised to have </p><p>more polling stations and he did. The Ambassador countered </p><p>that although there were more polling stations, they were </p><p>strategically placed in Mugabe rural strongholds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) The NSA digressed by reinforcing Nigeria\'s concern </p><p>about Zimbabwe. He said that President Obasanjo had </p><p>dedicated a tremendous amount of time and energy to the </p><p>issue, traveling to Zimbabwe six times and twice to London </p><p>before and after the elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The NSA concluded by conditioning his remarks </p><p>saying that they were his personal view, and not those of </p><p>GON. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
