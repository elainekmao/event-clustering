<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001934 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ENRG, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEVELOPING A STRUCTURE FOR BILATERAL </p><p>ENGAGEMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 123189 (B) ABUJA 755 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive But Unclassified, please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action cable; see para 7. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Embassy Abuja applauds the work of the Department on </p><p>developing a new structure for engaging Nigeria.  Ref A </p><p>closely reflects Embassy thinking on next steps for post-JEPC </p><p>engagement, and also mirrors many of the issues raised by the </p><p>GON.  Embassy is concerned, however, that energy is included </p><p>under the Economic Committee umbrella.  Given the centrality </p><p>of energy issues in Nigeria -- as the primary source of </p><p>revenue, pollution, and bilateral trade and investment, as </p><p>well as the principal issue of domestic political competition </p><p>-- Mission believes that a fourth committee on energy is </p><p>required. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Under JEPC, energy issues received specific, and </p><p>very focused attention through a separate bilateral.  Also, </p><p>Department of Energy and other USG agencies met with their </p><p>GON counterparts at least every six months to discuss energy </p><p>issues.   Post feels that the U.S. could benefit </p><p>significantly from a focused dialogue on energy, with special </p><p>attention to long-term implications for U.S. investment in </p><p>the oil and gas sector.  This is especially the case as the </p><p>GON transitions from Joint Ventures to Production Sharing </p><p>Contracts (PSCs) as the primary mode of future exploration </p><p>and production.  The growing role of natural gas production </p><p>in the Nigerian energy equation could also present new </p><p>challenges and opportunities, especially given the GON\'s </p><p>expressed intention to market its natural gas production in </p><p>the United States.  Nigeria\'s role in OPEC and the West </p><p>African Gas Pipeline are other salient issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In addition to the four committees, Post recommends </p><p>that the Department consider raising the profile of issues </p><p>important to Nigerians, such as HIV/AIDS and poverty </p><p>alleviation.  Earlier GON proposals regarding the structure </p><p>of the committees have focused on these concerns.  Our </p><p>proposal to the GON should, to the extent possible, also </p><p>incorporate Nigerian interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Committee and Working Group structure should </p><p>involve as much as possible interagency teams in Washington </p><p>that can implement specific objectives, such as attracting a </p><p>U.S. airline to Nigeria as mentioned in Ref B.  Embassy is </p><p>concerned that the structure described Ref A would give the </p><p>majority of the day-to-day work to Embassy Officers. </p><p>Unfortunately, Embassy Abuja lacks sufficient staff, </p><p>expertise and infrastructure to absorb this level of </p><p>additional work.  The Department should consider establishing </p><p>Office Director-led working groups that could meet once a </p><p>quarter to set benchmarks and initiate key actions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) On July 31, Ambassador Jeter met with President </p><p>Obasanjo to discuss among other issues, the proposed </p><p>restructuring of U.S.-Nigeria bilateral engagement per Ref A. </p><p> President Obasanjo was receptive to the concept of holding </p><p>Military Assistance/Defense, Law Enforcement and Economic </p><p>Committees.  The Ambassador informed him that the Embassy </p><p>would meet soon with the GON economic policy planning staff </p><p>to discuss the proposals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Action Requested: Please advise soonest whether </p><p>Embassy recommendations outlined above could be included in </p><p>the USG proposal. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
