<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 006462 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FM MUASHER PLEDGES GOJ WILL DO ALL IT CAN TO </p><p>PROTECT AMERICANS IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) During a November 4 meeting with FonMin Muasher, the </p><p>Ambassador conveyed his personal thanks for the GOJ\'s </p><p>response to the murder of USAID officer Larry Foley, its </p><p>affirmation of support for the U.S.-Jordanian relationship, </p><p>and -- most importantly -- the GOJ\'s willingness to provide </p><p>added security to protect the American community.  The </p><p>Ambassador said that all these measures have been greatly </p><p>appreciated, but noted there remains a high level of anxiety </p><p>in the Mission community -- especially since Larry Foley\'s </p><p>assailants have yet to be apprehended.  Muasher immediately </p><p>responded that "if there is anything more we can do, let me </p><p>know.  We want to do everything possible to address your </p><p>concerns."  The Ambassador commended the efforts the Public </p><p>Security Directorate (PSD) has undertaken, noting that, </p><p>except for a few details, deployment of additional security </p><p>personnel at Mission residences has gone smoothly.  Muasher </p><p>underlined that the Ambassador should let him know "of any </p><p>specific cases you have.  Don\'t hesitate day or night." </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador called Muasher\'s attention to November </p><p>4 press reports of inflammatory statements made by senior </p><p>officials of the opposition Islamic Action Front (IAF) during </p><p>a November 3 conference in Amman.  (Note: Islamic scholars </p><p>attending the conference had, according to press accounts, </p><p>issued fatwas calling on leaders of Muslim countries to </p><p>"refrain from extending any assistance to the U.S. if it </p><p>launches an attack on Iraq" and to "end their military </p><p>cooperation with the U.S. including joint exercises, security </p><p>coordination and the extending of technical and logistical </p><p>assistance to U.S. troops in the region."  The press also </p><p>quoted IAF Secretary General Hamza Mansour as stating </p><p>"Americans will pay with their lives and their interests </p><p>(for) . . . their government\'s arrogant policies").  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that, given the tragic events of the past </p><p>week and the GOJ\'s publicly articulated policies, these </p><p>statements were a cause of deep concern for the safety and </p><p>welfare of the American community and posed "a blatant </p><p>challenge to the Government of Jordan and what it is trying </p><p>to do."  Muasher\'s response was clear and to the point: "This </p><p>is serious.  I will deal with it."  (Note: News reports </p><p>immediately following the murder of Larry Foley quoted IAF </p><p>officials as saying that IAF condemnation of U.S. policies </p><p>did not sanction murder (Amman 6309). </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
