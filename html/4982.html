Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  New data provided by Jordan\'s Statistics department </p><p>shows a major shift in the pattern of Jordan\'s exports to </p><p>Iraq.  What has been for half a decade a fairly static market </p><p>for vegetable oil, feed, and medicine expanded </p><p>comprehensively to include a wide array of additional </p><p>products.  The shift shows how the GOJ capitalized on </p><p>preferential access to the Iraqi market, but also highlights </p><p>Jordan\'s continuing economic dependence on exports to Iraq. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  Since the mid-1990\'s, Jordan has exported to Iraq </p><p>under two programs - the U.N.\'s Oil-For-Food (OFF) program </p><p>and a bilateral protocol under which Jordan bartered goods in </p><p>return for free and discounted Iraqi oil.  Since 1995, that </p><p>protocol has called for Jordanian exports ranging in value </p><p>from $250-$350 million.  But Jordanian exporters rarely </p><p>reached the ceiling, typically exporting only around one-half </p><p>of their allotment in any given year.  In fact, Jordan\'s </p><p>domestic exports to Iraq over this period averaged about $168 </p><p>million per year - an amount that, while small, still made </p><p>Iraq a top-3 export market for the period.  (Note:  domestic </p><p>exports almost exclusively represent exports under the </p><p>protocol.  OFF exports are primarily re-exports from third </p><p>countries, and are counted under a separate line-item.  End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>----    -----------------------          ----------- </p><p>Year    JO exports to Iraq, $mn          Export rank </p><p>----    -----------------------          ----------- </p><p>1995             269.0                        1 </p><p>1996             135.6                        2 </p><p>1997             200.4                        1 </p><p>1998             149.7                        2 </p><p>1999             113.4                        3 </p><p>2000             141.1                        2 </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  The composition of these exports was fairly steady </p><p>over the period - about 90% of exports were composed of </p><p>animal feed, vegetable oil, and pharmaceuticals.  GOJ </p><p>officials were careful to ensure that re-exports were not </p><p>exported under the protocol, so that preferential market </p><p>access was reserved for Jordanian-origin products. </p><p>(Authorities have consistently told us as well that export </p><p>contracts - whether under OFF or the protocol - are carefully </p><p>screened by customs and security officials to ensure that no </p><p>UN-prohibited goods are sent to Iraq.) </p><p> </p><p>TURNAROUND 2001 </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Preliminary 2001 statistics released by the GOJ in </p><p>March 2002 showed that the U.S., primarily due to textile </p><p>exports under the Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) </p><p>initiative, had become Jordan\'s number one export market, </p><p>topping Iraq by about $4.5 million.  These statistics were </p><p>trumpeted by the GOJ (and the Embassy) throughout the spring </p><p>and summer as more proof positive of the benefits of free </p><p>trade and of the re-orientation of Jordanian exports to the </p><p>west.  By September 2002, though, the final figures as </p><p>released by the GOJ showed a starkly different picture: </p><p>Jordanian exports to Iraq were listed at $422 million, almost </p><p>twice the kingdom\'s exports to the U.S. that year of $232 </p><p>million.  These figures were a wholesale departure from the </p><p>trend of the last half of the 1990\'s, and the new trend has </p><p>continued in 2002:  Jordanian exports to Iraq for the first </p><p>half of 2002 stand at $182.6 million. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  In addition, the composition of exports changed </p><p>dramatically in 2001:  vegetable oil, pharmaceuticals and </p><p>animal feed together accounted for less than 30% of total </p><p>exports, compared with around 90% in previous years.  The </p><p>balance of exported goods was all over the map - soaps, </p><p>plastics, electrical machinery, mechanical appliances, </p><p>textiles, and the like (Note:  complete 9-digit HTS schedule </p><p>of exports from 1999-2001 e-mailed to NEA/ARN.  End note.). </p><p> </p><p>--  -----------      ----------------  ----------------- </p><p>HS  Description        Volume ($mn)       % total </p><p>                     \'99   \'00   \'01    \'99   \'00   \'01 </p><p>--  -----------      ----------------  ----------------- </p><p>15  veg oil          51.7  56.8  54.4   45.6  40.3  12.9 </p><p>30  pharmaceuticals  39.9  58.5  40.5   35.2  41.5   9.6 </p><p>39  plastics                     35.8                8.5 </p><p>34  soaps                        34.8                8.2 </p><p>85  elec machinery               32.8                7.8 </p><p>84  mech appliances              30.9                7.3 </p><p>87  vehicles                     25.5                6.0 </p><p>72  iron and steel               24.5                5.8 </p><p>48  paper products               22.6                5.4 </p><p>23  animal feed      11.0  17.3  21.7    9.7  12.3   5.1 </p><p> </p><p>total               102.6 132.6 323.5   90.5  94.1  76.6 </p><p> </p><p>THE CALCULUS OF TRADE </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  Prior to the 1991 Gulf War, numerous small Jordanian </p><p>factories produced soaps, chemicals, solvents, paints, </p><p>machinery, and textiles for the Iraqi market.  When sanctions </p><p>were imposed after the Gulf War, many of these small </p><p>companies either went under or went into hibernation, as Iraq </p><p>was the sole market for their products.  Thus many of the </p><p>"new" products on the list in 2001 but absent in previous </p><p>years can be considered "traditional" Jordanian exports to </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  GOJ officials have told us that two tendencies </p><p>combined to dry up the Iraqi market for these companies. </p><p>Some products, of course, were prohibited under UNSC </p><p>sanctions.  But when Jordanian companies tried to export </p><p>permitted products under the oil and trade protocol, the </p><p>Iraqi government in many cases refused to accept the goods. </p><p>As one senior official said, "they won\'t take what we\'re </p><p>making, and we don\'t make what they\'re buying."  A big part </p><p>of Iraq\'s decision not to import those goods, officials say, </p><p>was to "punish" Jordan for upholding UN sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  Jordan continues to have a commercial interest in </p><p>selling whatever it can into the Iraqi market, particularly </p><p>in sectors that are aligned solely to that market.  At the </p><p>same time, many Jordanian trade experts believe that </p><p>Jordanian products would not be competitive in an open Iraqi </p><p>market.  Thus, as the potential for military action in Iraq </p><p>looms, Jordan is keener than ever to exploit their </p><p>preferential market access under the protocol, in an effort </p><p>to help Jordanian companies secure market share and "brand </p><p>identification" before the Iraqi market opens to competition </p><p>from Turkey, China, and other relatively lower-cost, </p><p>higher-quality producers. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (c)  Iraq\'s motives are equally apparent, if more </p><p>political.  In the short term, Iraq has received positive PR </p><p>from being Jordan\'s number one trading partner and top-3 </p><p>export market.  Iraq has often played on this with Jordanian </p><p>industry in an effort to pressure the GOJ into closer </p><p>alignment with Iraqi interests.  (The announcement in March </p><p>2002 that the U.S. had become Jordan\'s top export market no </p><p>doubt rankled Iraq and could partially explain the late surge </p><p>in export approvals that put Iraq firmly back on top.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (c)  In the longer term, by re-opening its market to </p><p>Jordanian industrial goods, Iraq no doubt hopes to revive the </p><p>ties between erstwhile defunct Jordanian industries and </p><p>increase Jordan\'s economic dependence on Iraq.  The </p><p>high-profile visit of the Iraqi Trade Minister to the Amman </p><p>Chambers of Commerce and Industry in late 2002 was an obvious </p><p>attempt to underscore that dependence to both the private </p><p>sector and the GOJ.  Flooding Jordan with new contract </p><p>approvals can thus be seen as an attempt to renew the </p><p>pressure Jordan\'s small industrialists once put on the GOJ - </p><p>pressure that has decreased as those companies grew </p><p>accustomed to lower levels of business and as some companies </p><p>started to re-orient toward western markets. </p><p> </p><p>IMPACT, SOLUTIONS </p><p> </p><p>11.  (c)  By re-opening its market to traditional Jordanian </p><p>industrial exports, Iraq has potentially opened an old wound </p><p>for the GOJ.  Companies wholly reliant on the Iraqi market, </p><p>according to GOJ figures provided in August 2002, number </p><p>around 400 and employ somewhat less than 20,000 people.  Add </p><p>to that the 2,000 truckers who according to the GOJ earn </p><p>their livelihood hauling goods to Iraq, and there is </p><p>potential for significant dislocations in a sector that is </p><p>just starting to regain its footing. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (c)  After the loss of concessional oil deliveries from </p><p>Iraq, the second most important channel through which a </p><p>military confrontation with Iraq would impact Jordan\'s </p><p>economy would be the loss of its preferential export access </p><p>to Iraq.  Although it is making some progress in increasing </p><p>its exports to countries outside Iraq (notably the U.S., </p><p>Israel, and neighboring Arab markets), it will be some time </p><p>before Jordan has a truly diverse export base.  A sudden </p><p>disruption in Iraq trade would mean loss of jobs and </p><p>government revenue.  One way to help mitigate this disruption </p><p>would be to find ways to encourage a new Iraqi government, as </p><p>well as refugee and relief organizations, to continue to </p><p>procure needed equipment and supplies from Jordan to the </p><p>extent possible within price and quantity restraints. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
