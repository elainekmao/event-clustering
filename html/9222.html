<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001370 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO AFRICA; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   President George W. Bush\'s visit to Africa remains the </p><p>      top issue for discussion in lengthy editorials being </p><p>      carried in the mainstream newspapers ahead of the July 7 - </p><p>      12 visit.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Bush must respect African leadership" </p><p>      the government-controlled daily "The Herald" (07/07), </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "American leader Mr. George W. Bush begins his first </p><p>      visit to Africa. . .with very dirty hands after his </p><p>      alleged bungling in Iraq.  American and British </p><p>      troops stand accused of slaughtering thousands of </p><p>      unarmed civilians including women and children </p><p>      during the U. S.-led invasion of Iraq. . .Mr. Bush </p><p>      will be hoping to make the whole world believe that </p><p>      America cares about Africa despite ample evidence to </p><p>      the contrary. . .Whatever his real motive for coming </p><p>      to Africa, Mr. Bush had better not dictate things to </p><p>      anyone, lest, as President Mugabe warned over the </p><p>      weekend, he be spurned. . .While we know that no </p><p>      African leader worth his salt and who really knows </p><p>      America will accept to be used by the likes of Mr. </p><p>      Bush, we think an opportunity has arisen for the </p><p>      Texan to experience first-hand the rock-solid unity </p><p>      prevalent in Africa.. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Bush visit: What\'s in it for Zimbabwe" </p><p>      the independent weekly "The Standard" (07/06), comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Whether President Mugabe and ZANU PF choose to </p><p>      dismiss the visit as a non-event or not, the point </p><p>      must be forcefully made that each of the countries </p><p>      to be visited is moving ahead while Zimbabwe is </p><p>      definitely retreating back to Stone Age.  This is </p><p>      the reality which is staring us in the face. . </p><p>      .Describing Colin Powell as a `disgraceful Uncle </p><p>      Tom\' and other such vitriol might be what Jonathan </p><p>      Moyo (Information Minister) believes he is paid for, </p><p>      but it certainly will not bring food on the tables </p><p>      of long suffering Zimbabweans.  It was, in terms of </p><p>      foreign relations, an extraordinary inept thing to </p><p>      say even for a government not known for its delicacy </p><p>      of diplomacy.  If these crude and undignified </p><p>      attacks on President Bush and U. S. Secretary of </p><p>      State Colin Powell were being made from a position </p><p>      of strength, perhaps we would be more guarded in our </p><p>      criticism. . .This paper emphatically agrees with </p><p>      Colin Powell. . .However, by the same token, we </p><p>      share the view that the U. S. should not adopt the </p><p>      role of a world policeman advocating a regime </p><p>      change.  Rather it should concentrate its energies </p><p>      on helping the people of Zimbabwe and African </p><p>      leaders resolve a specific political problem such as </p><p>      the one in this country.  Yes, the United States </p><p>      might be the leader of the free world, is a great </p><p>      democracy, a military super power and a nation </p><p>      unequalled in material wealth.  But all that does </p><p>      not give it the right to act as a world policeman </p><p>      and calling for regime changes wherever there is a </p><p>      problem.  Our advice to the U. S. is that acting in </p><p>      this high handed manner can only alienate people and </p><p>      needlessly lose the goodwill of its friends in </p><p>      Africa.  Powell\'s dramatic language ran the risk of </p><p>      being interpreted as war-mongering and parallels </p><p>      being drawn with the Iraq war. . .The U. S. </p><p>      administration\'s criticism of the Mugabe regime is </p><p>      very valid. . .But in his meeting with Presidents </p><p>      Mbeki and Obasanjo, President Bush is advised not to </p><p>      display a one-eyed view of the continent.  While </p><p>      making his analysis of the Zimbabwe crisis clear, he </p><p>      must also be prepared to listen carefully to what </p><p>      the African leaders will have to say and move in </p><p>      tandem with them for the resolution of the </p><p>      Zimbabwean crisis. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Bush visit no panacea to our problems" </p><p>      the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" (07/06) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "We reiterate our position that U. S. President, </p><p>      George W. Bush\'s visit to the southern African </p><p>      region this week will not have any impact on </p><p>      Zimbabwe. . .For those hoping that Bush will effect </p><p>      a regime change in Zimbabwe. . .we urge them to </p><p>      study that prospect more realistically and not be </p><p>      blinded by the euphoria of expectations that has </p><p>      clouded sound vision among their ranks. . .It is not </p><p>      important for us to point out that Liberia presents </p><p>      the most nagging challenge for the Americans at the </p><p>      moment and that if any imminent action is demanded </p><p>      of the U. S. right now, it is on that beleaguered </p><p>      West African state. . .On the resolution of </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s political impasse and its attendant </p><p>      economic woes, the process initiated by the African </p><p>      troika still presents itself as the only legitimate </p><p>      `road map. . .\'  Our message to those who have </p><p>      burdened Bush\'s imminent visit with their misplaced </p><p>      expectations, therefore, is that they should look </p><p>      inwards for a resolution to the country\'s problems. </p><p>      The sooner this is done, the quicker our problems </p><p>      are sorted out - by ourselves. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Under headline "Warning to MDC surrogates" the </p><p>      government-controlled Bulawayo-based daily </p><p>      "Chronicle" (07/05), comments: </p><p> </p><p>     "The U. S. and Britain. . .are driving terror into </p><p>     many nations in the name of fighting terrorism. . .Of </p><p>     late they have been threatening to include what they </p><p>     call regime change on a number of countries, including </p><p>     Zimbabwe, viewed as not towing the line. . .Bush and </p><p>     his Secretary for State, Collin (sic) Powell have in </p><p>     recent weeks stepped up their vilification of </p><p>     President Mugabe and publicly called for his ouster </p><p>     from power. . .President Mugabe on Thursday told the </p><p>     54th Ordinary Session of the ruling ZANU PF Central </p><p>     Committee that Africans should not be intimidated by </p><p>     Bush\'s visit.  `He is coming to visit and he should </p><p>     not dare to try what he did to Iraq.  He knows the </p><p>     situation is different.  After all we do not have oil </p><p>     here,\' said an unperturbed President Mugabe.  While </p><p>     welcoming . . .Mugabe\'s words of courage, it is </p><p>     disheartening that there are some sellouts among us, </p><p>     especially within the opposition MDC who appear </p><p>     determined to team up with foreigners like Bush to </p><p>     destabilize the country. . .This business of teaming </p><p>     up with foreigners against your brother is un-African </p><p>     . . .As South African President Thabo Mbeki said </p><p>     recently, the problems affecting Zimbabwe can be </p><p>     solved by Zimbabweans.  Neighbors and the </p><p>     international community can only assist.  We urge MDC </p><p>     and British and American masters to take President </p><p>     Mbeki\'s advice very seriously to avoid embarrassing </p><p>     themselves. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  6.   Under headline "The root of misrule in Zimbabwe" the </p><p>      independent weekly "Zimbabwe Independent" (07/04) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .U. S. Secretary of State Colin Powell\'s </p><p>      comparison of Zimbabwe\'s regime with that of </p><p>      Burma\'s, where state violence against a popular </p><p>      opposition has ensured for that country the </p><p>      reputation of a rogue state, appears to have stung </p><p>      members of Mugabe\'s inner circle.  And so it should. </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s international standing has been </p><p>      prejudiced by ongoing state-sponsored terror and </p><p>      impunity for those who have assaulted, tortured and </p><p>      killed members of the opposition.  Zimbabwe\'s rulers </p><p>      are getting the reputation they deserve. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  7.   Under headline " Bush must tread softly in Africa" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly  "Business Tribune" (07/03) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "Threats coming from the U. S. that American </p><p>      President George Bush would `lean hard\' on South </p><p>      African President Thabo Mbeki to change his policy </p><p>      on Zimbabwe show that the American administration </p><p>      overestimates the power Mbeki wields over his </p><p>      Zimbabwean counterpart.  Also, it shows that </p><p>      America\'s view of the Zimbabwean problem is overly </p><p>      simplistic.  Mbeki. . .long realized that the </p><p>      Zimbabwean problem can only be solved by Zimbabweans </p><p>      themselves without undue influence from interested </p><p>      parties such as Britain and America. . .In a way </p><p>      Bush\'s expected posturing in South Africa next week </p><p>      might reverse the little gains achieved so far. </p><p>      Bush\'s African tour must be seen in the bigger </p><p>      picture of his attempt to cow the African continent </p><p>      into submitting to American dominance of world </p><p>      trade.  In his remarks to the Corporate Council on </p><p>      Africa\'s U. S.-Africa Business Summit. . .Bush </p><p>      betrayed the true purpose of his tour, namely that </p><p>      it was more about American interests than anything </p><p>      else. . . By `leaning hard\' on Mbeki next week </p><p>      Bush\'s intention is simply to add him to the list of </p><p>      submissive African heads of state prepared to </p><p>      mortgage their countries\' sovereignty to American </p><p>      imperialism.  Bush should tread softly on his path </p><p>      in Africa." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
