SUMMARY: STATE DEPARTMENT SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS (SRILA) SANDRA POLASKI BRIEFED </p><p>VIETNAMESE TRADE AND LABOR OFFICIALS AND INDUSTRY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES ON THE LABOR PROVISIONS OF THE U.S.-CAMBODIA </p><p>TEXTILE AGREEMENT.  BECAUSE NEITHER THE U.S. NOR VIETNAM HAS </p><p>YET MADE AN INTERNAL DECISION ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF A </p><p>TEXTILES AGREEMENT OR A NEGOTIATING TIMETABLE, MS. POLASKI </p><p>PROVIDED GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE APPROACH THE U.S. USED </p><p>WITH CAMBODIA AND THE SUCCESSFUL RESULTS, IN THE U.S. VIEW, </p><p>FOR BOTH PARTIES.  WHILE THE BRIEFING WAS WELL RECEIVED, </p><p>VICE MINISTER OF TRADE LUONG VAN TU MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE </p><p>GVN CONTINUES TO HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF A </p><p>TEXTILES AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, IN A SUBSEQUENT MEETING WITH </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR, THE MINISTER OF TRADE INDICATED THE GVN IS </p><p>PREPARED TO "EXCHANGE VIEWS."  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT </p><p>GVN AGREEMENT TO THE BRIEFING IS ITSELF A SUBTLE CHANGE FROM </p><p>ITS PREVIOUS RELUCTANCE TO DISCUSS POTENTIAL CONNECTIONS </p><p>BETWEEN TRADE AND LABOR ISSUES, INDICATING THAT WHILE THE </p><p>GVN DOES NOT AGREE, IT IS IN A LISTENING MODE.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING HER VISIT TO HANOI (REF A), DECEMBER 19-22, SRILA </p><p>SANDRA POLASKI BRIEFED VICE MINISTER OF TRADE LUONG VAN TU </p><p>ON THE U.S. EXPERIENCE WITH THE LABOR PROVISIONS OF THE U.S.- </p><p>CAMBODIA TEXTILE AGREEMENT (THE TEXTILE AGREEMENT).  VICE </p><p>MINISTER TU WAS JOINED BY MOT OFFICIALS FROM THE NORTH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00102  01 OF 02  150748Z </p><p>AMERICA OFFICE AND THE EXPORT-IMPORT MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT, </p><p>NGUYEN MANH CUONG, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELATIONS DEPARTMENT AT THE MINISTRY OF LABOR, SOCIAL </p><p>AFFAIRS AND INVALIDS (MOLISA) AND MR. NGUYEN XUAN HAO, </p><p>DEPUTY GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE VIETNAM TEXTILE AND APPAREL </p><p>ASSOCIATION (VITAS).  MS. POLASKI WAS JOINED BY ECONOMIC </p><p>COUNSELOR CLAIRE PIERANGELO AND LABOR OFFICER LINDA SPECHT </p><p>(NOTE TAKER). </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE BRIEFING WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT </p><p>IT DID NOT INDICATE A DECISION ON THE PART OF EITHER VIETNAM </p><p>OR THE UNITED STATES ON WHETHER TO NEGOTIATE A TEXTILE </p><p>AGREEMENT OR WHAT SUCH AN AGREEMENT WOULD CONTAIN.  HAVING </p><p>ESTABLISHED THAT UNDERSTANDING, MS. POLASKI FRAMED HER </p><p>BRIEFING IN TERMS OF THE LOGIC AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO </p><p>VIETNAM OF INCLUDING LABOR PROVISIONS IN A TEXTILE </p><p>AGREEMENT.  MS. POLASKI INFORMED HER AUDIENCE THAT, UNDER </p><p>ITS TEXTILE AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S., CAMBODIA RECEIVES QUOTA </p><p>BONUSES LINKED TO SUCCESSFUL ENFORCEMENT OF ITS LABOR LAW, </p><p>APPLICATION OF CORE INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS, AND </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS IN WORKING CONDITIONS.  SHE DID NOT DISCUSS </p><p>SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THAT AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MS. POLASKI REPORTED THAT THE APPROACH ADOPTED IN THE </p><p>CAMBODIA AGREEMENT PRODUCED A "WIN-WIN" SITUATION FOR THE </p><p>PARTIES IN WHICH TRADE POLICY REINFORCES GOOD DOMESTIC LABOR </p><p>POLICY, IN TURN PROVIDING TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO CAMBODIA AND </p><p>CAMBODIAN WORKERS.  FIRST, AS A RESULT OF THE TEXTILE </p><p>AGREEMENT AND QUOTA BONUSES, CAMBODIA\'S FIVE-YEAR OLD </p><p>TEXTILE AND APPAREL SECTOR HAD GROWN RAPIDLY AND NOW STANDS </p><p>AT MORE THAN USD 1 BILLION IN TEXTILE AND APPAREL EXPORTS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00102  01 OF 02  150748Z </p><p>ANNUALLY.  SHE NOTED THAT CAMBODIA REPORTS IT IS THE FIRST </p><p>LEAST-DEVELOPED COUNTRY TO REACH THAT MARK.  AND WORKERS </p><p>HAVE BENEFITED: THE SECTOR NOW PROVIDES ROUGHLY 200,000 </p><p>JOBS, WELL-PAID BY LOCAL STANDARDS.  BUT PERHAPS MORE </p><p>IMPORTANT, THE AGREEMENT HAS PROMOTED QUALITY GROWTH IN THIS </p><p>KEY SECTOR.  THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR MONITORING OF </p><p>FACTORIES BY THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION, FUNDED BY </p><p>THE USG, THE CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE CAMBODIAN APPAREL </p><p>INDUSTRY.  ACCORDING TO MS. POLASKI, THE EXISTENCE OF A </p><p>CREDIBLE, NEUTRAL REVIEW OF LABOR PRACTICES IN THE APPAREL </p><p>SECTOR HAS ATTRACTED BUYERS AND RETAILERS FROM THE U.S. WHO </p><p>HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY IN THEIR REPUTATIONS AND BRANDS.  SUCH </p><p>BUYERS ARE WILLING TO PAY A PREMIUM FOR GOOD QUALITY </p><p>MERCHANDISE AND QUALITY LABOR RELATIONS, AND CONSEQUENTLY, </p><p>OFFER BETTER CONTRACT TERMS THAN OTHER BUYERS.  SHE ALSO </p><p>NOTED THAT THE AGREEMENT PROMOTED ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>STABILITY BY IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS AND LABOR </p><p>RELATIONS AND PROVIDING ALTERNATIVES TO STRIKES TO RESOLVE </p><p>LABOR DISPUTES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  VM TU EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE INFORMATION MS. </p><p>POLASKI PROVIDED.  HE ARGUED, HOWEVER, THAT, AS A LEADER OF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEM, THE UNITED STATES\' </p><p>PRIORITY SHOULD BE ON LOWERING BARRIERS TO TRADE.  AND ON </p><p>TEXTILES, ANY DECISION BY THE U.S. TO IMPOSE QUOTAS WOULD </p><p>RUN COUNTER TO INTERNATIONAL TRENDS.  ACCORDING TO VM TU, </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2434 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00102  02 OF 02  150748Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EAP-00   EB-00    EXME-00  E-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   MOFM-05 </p><p>      MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PC-01    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /019W </p><p>                  ------------------57C4F2  150748Z /38 </p><p>R 150737Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5248 </p><p>INFO DEPTLABOR WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 000102 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL DAS JSCARPENTER, DRL/IL GWHITE </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR EAP/BCLTV AND EB/TPP BBOYNTON </p><p>USTR FFOR CMILLER, RALPH IVES AND ELENA BRYANT </p><p>DEPTLABOR FOR ILAB BETSY WHITE </p><p>USDOC FOR 4431/MAC/IEP/OKSA/HPPHO </p><p>EMBASSY PHNOM PENH FOR BRUCE LEVINE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SEVERAL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING CANADA AND NORWAY HAD </p><p>ELIMINATED QUOTAS ON VIETNAMESE GARMENTS, AND THE EUROPEAN </p><p>UNION WAS CONSIDERING DOING SO.  FURTHERMORE, HE ARGUED, WTO </p><p>MEMBERS HAD AGREED TO PHASE OUT QUOTAS UNDER THE AGREEMENT </p><p>ON TEXTILES AND CLOTHING (ATC) BY JANUARY 2005 AND AGREED AT </p><p>DOHA TO ACCELERATE THIS PHASE-OUT.  THEREFORE, HE REASONED, </p><p>THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT IMPOSE QUOTAS WHEN IT WAS IN </p><p>FACT OBLIGATED TO BEGIN PHASING THEM OUT.  (NOTE:  AT DOHA, </p><p>WTO MEMBERS DID AGREED TO CONSIDER PROPOSALS TO ACCELERATE </p><p>REDUCTIONS AND/OR PHASE OUTS OF QUOTAS IN CERTAIN CASES BUT </p><p>DID NOT AGREE TO ACCELERATE PHASE OUT OF THE ENTIRE QUOTA </p><p>SYSTEM UNDER THE ATC.  FURTHERMORE, THE UNITED STATES WOULD </p><p>NOT BE OBLIGATED TO EXTEND THIS TREATMENT TO VIETNAM UNTIL </p><p>IT JOINS THE WTO.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>6.  WITH RESPECT TO LABOR ISSUES, VM TU CLAIMED THAT </p><p>VIETNAM\'S LABOR CODE WAS "PROGRESSIVE" AND WORKING </p><p>CONDITIONS HERE COMPARED WELL WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE </p><p>REGION AND THOSE WITH SIMILAR LEVELS OF ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  HE REFRAINED FROM COMMENTING FURTHER ON THE </p><p>SUBSTANCE OF MS. POLASKI\'S PRESENTATION STATING THAT MOLISA, </p><p>NOT MOT, HAD JURISDICTION AND EXPERTISE OVER LABOR ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT:  DESPITE VM TU\'S MISINTERPRETATION OF THE </p><p>RESULTS OF DOHA IN REGARDS TO THE ATC, HIS COMMENTS REFLECT </p><p>THE GVN\'S GENERAL DOUBTS AND RELUCTANCE ABOUT A TEXTILE </p><p>AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT INCLUDES LABOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00102  02 OF 02  150748Z </p><p>PROVISIONS OR NOT.  HOWEVER, AS REPORTED REF B, IN A </p><p>SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION WITH AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT, MINISTER </p><p>OF TRADE VU KHOAN INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO MEET TO </p><p>"EXCHANGE VIEWS."  NONETHELESS, THE BRIEFING BY MS. POLASKI </p><p>WAS WELL RECEIVED, AND A NUMBER OF WORKING LEVEL </p><p>PARTICIPANTS TOLD LABOR OFFICER THAT THE INFORMATION WAS </p><p>VERY USEFUL.  PRIOR TO THIS, THE GVN OFFICIALS HAVE </p><p>RESPONDED VERY NEGATIVELY TO ANY HINT OF A POTENTIAL </p><p>CONNECTION BETWEEN LABOR AND TEXTILES OR ANY OTHER TRADE </p><p>ISSUE.  THAT THE VIETNAMESE AGREED TO THE BRIEFING INDICATES </p><p>THEY ARE IN A LISTENING MODE, GATHERING INFORMATION THEY </p><p>NEED TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO APPROACH </p><p>US ON THE ISSUE OF TEXTILES AND RESPOND TO U.S. CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT LABOR CONDITIONS IN THIS SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>8.  MS. POLAKSI CLEARED ON THIS MESSAGE. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
