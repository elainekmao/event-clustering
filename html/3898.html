<p>UNCLAS STATE 195704 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR AMBASSADOR OR DCM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AMGT </p><p>SUBJECT: SMART - A NEW MESSAGING SYSTEM FOR STATE </p><p> </p><p>REF:   A.  STATE 028800  B. STATE 070240 </p><p> </p><p>FROM UNDER SECRETARY FOR MANAGEMENT GREEN </p><p> </p><p>1.  PLEASE PROVIDE WIDE DISSEMINATION OF THE INFORMATION </p><p>IN THIS TELEGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON FEBRUARY 14, 2002, (REFTEL A) I ANNOUNCED A PLAN </p><p>FOR CONSIDERING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW INTEGRATED </p><p>MESSAGING SYSTEM BY 2004 AND INVITED YOUR COMMENTS THROUGH </p><p>A WEBSITE ON OPENNET AND CLASSNET.  USER COMMENTS WERE </p><p>STUDIED AND CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY A TASK FORCE FROM IRM, </p><p>S/ES, AND A IN DEVELOPING A RECOMMENDATION FOR MY </p><p>CONSIDERATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. ON APRIL 12, 2002 (REFTEL B), WE ANNOUNCED THE </p><p>COMPLETION OF THE WORK OF THE TASK FORCE AND COMMUNICATED </p><p>THE WEB ADDRESS FOR YOUR EXAMINATION OF ITS VISION AND </p><p>OPTIONS.  AGAIN YOUR COMMENTS WERE SOLICITED AND REVIEWED </p><p>ON RECEIPT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SINCE THEN I HAVE FORMED A STEERING COMMITTEE OF </p><p>SENIOR LEVEL SUBSTANTIVE, MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES UNDER THE CHAIR OF AMBASSADOR JOE LAKE. </p><p>THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN MEETING BIWEEKLY TO OVERSEE OPTIONS </p><p>AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  FOUR WORKING GROUPS ARE REPORTING TO </p><p>THE STEERING COMMITTEE.  ONE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH </p><p>DEVELOPING A PROTOTYPE AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT. THE SECOND </p><p>IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES IN GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY.  THE THIRD IS EXAMINING SECURITY </p><p>ISSUES.  AND THE FOURTH, RECENTLY CONVENED, HAS BEGUN TO </p><p>CONSIDER CHANGE MANAGEMENT ISSUES INCLUDING TRAINING. </p><p>AFSA AND AFGE ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT </p><p>WORKING GROUP. (WE ARE FORMING A FIFTH WORKING GROUP TO </p><p>OVERSEE THE CONVERGENCE OF THE FASI PROJECT ON KNOWLEDGE </p><p>MANAGEMENT AND INTERAGENCY COLLABORATION WITH THE </p><p>MESSAGING SYSTEM.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  WE HAVE NAMED THE MESSAGING SYSTEM THE STATE MESSAGING </p><p>AND ARCHIVE RETRIEVAL TOOLSET  TO DESCRIBE ITS BREADTH AND </p><p>TO GIVE IT A MEMORABLE ACRONYM: SMART.  (WE RECOGNIZE THE </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR IRONY IF USERS BELIEVE IT TO BE ANYTHING </p><p>LESS.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE PROTOTYPE HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND IS SCHEDULED TO </p><p>BE DEMONSTRATED TO THE STEERING COMMITTEE ON OCTOBER 9. </p><p>THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NO DECISIONS HAVE YET BEEN MADE. </p><p>FOR THAT WE AGAIN NEED YOUR INPUT.  PLEASE LOOK AT THE </p><p>DESCRIPTION OF SMART ON THE OPENNET WEBSITE AT </p><p>MESSAGING.IRM.STATE.GOV OR THE CLASS NET WEBSITE AT </p><p>MESSAGING.IRM.STATE.SGOV.GOV AND GIVE US YOUR REACTIONS, </p><p>COMMENTS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS.  WE WOULD WELCOME ANY </p><p>FEEDBACK YOU CAN PROVIDE BEFORE OCTOBER 31. IN THE </p><p>MEANTIME,  THE PROTOTYPE WILL BE EVALUATED BY 500 SELECTED </p><p>USERS FROM OVERSEAS AND WASHINGTON.  THE EVALUATION IS </p><p>BEING CONDUCTED BY  THE E DIPLOMACY TASK FORCE OVERSEEING </p><p>THE WORK OF AN INDEPENDENT FIRM,  THE GARTNER GROUP, TO </p><p>ENSURE OBJECTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IMPLEMENTING SMART BY 2004 WILL BE A CONSIDERABLE </p><p>CHALLENGE.  AS IT WILL INCORPORATE AND CONSOLIDATE </p><p>EXISTING MESSAGING SYSTEMS - INCLUDING CABLES, E-MAILS, </p><p>AND MEMORANDA - IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE GET IT RIGHT SO </p><p>THAT IT GIVES YOU BETTER TOOLS WITH WHICH TO DO YOUR WORK. </p><p>INPUT FROM THOSE WHO DO THE WORK WILL BE A KEY FACTOR IN </p><p>OUR DECISION-MAKING. </p><p> </p><p>8.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p>POWELL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>   STATE   00195704 </p><p></p></div>
