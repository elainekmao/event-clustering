AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE STRESSED </p><p>U.S. DETERMINATION TO RESOLVE THE REFUGEE SITUATION IN </p><p>WEST TIMOR AND ARRANGED FOR XANANA TO RECORD A </p><p>STATEMENT REFUTING MILITIA DISINFORMATION AND URGING </p><p>THE REFUGEES TO RETURN. HE ADVISED XANANA THAT HE </p><p>WOULD BE DEALING WITH A MUCH IMPROVED GOI DURING HIS </p><p>UPCOMING VISIT TO JAKARTA.  XANANA MADE CLEAR HIS </p><p>RESISTANCE TO "BEING FORCED TO ACCEPT MILITIA LEADERS </p><p>AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED."  THE CNRT LEADER ALSO </p><p>REMAINED CONCERNED THAT UNTAET AND THE NGO\'S WERE NOT </p><p>ADEQUATELY CONSULTING HIS PEOPLE.  XANANA INDICATED </p><p>THAT HE AND HIS ADVISORS NOW WERE THINKING ABOUT A </p><p>QUICKER TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>WARM RECEPTION </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DUE TO XANANA GUSMAO\'S ILLNESS (THE </p><p>CNRT LEADER WAS FEVERISH AND COUGHING -- WE </p><p>ARRANGED FOR A U.S. MILITARY DOCTOR TO VISIT </p><p>HIM ON NOVEMBER 24), AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE AND </p><p>PARTY ASCENDED VIA UNTAET HELICOPTER TO </p><p>XANANA\'S CURRENT HEADQUARTERS AT AILEU, A COOL </p><p>MOUNTAIN TOWN 50 KM SOUTH OF DILI.  SEVERAL </p><p>HUNDRED ARMED AND SMARTLY UNIFORMED FALINTIL </p><p>GUERRILLAS STOOD AT ATTENTION AT THE LARGE </p><p>FIELD WHERE THE HELICOPTER LANDED, MANY WITH </p><p>LONG HAIR PROTRUDING FROM THEIR RED BERETS. </p><p>AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE WAS GREETED BY XANANA, </p><p>WHO WAS FLANKED BY UDT (TIMORESE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>UNION) LEADER JOAO CARRASCALAO AND ALSO </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY DEPUTY FALINTIL COMMANDER MATAN </p><p>RUAK. AFTER PASSING THROUGH HUNDREDS OF </p><p>ONLOOKERS AND SEVERAL ROWS OF WOMEN DRESSED IN </p><p>A VARIETY OF COLORFUL EAST TIMORESE </p><p>TRADITIONAL GARMENTS, AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE AND </p><p>PARTY JOINED XANANA AND HIS AIDES ON A COVERED </p><p>STAGE TO WATCH AN IMPRESSIVE PROGRAM PRESENTED </p><p>BY TRADITIONAL DANCERS REPRESENTING VARIOUS </p><p>FALINTIL REGIONS.  SOME NOT SO TRADITIONAL </p><p>DANCING BY THE 8 TO 10 YEAR OLD SET (TO </p><p>CURRENT POP HITS PLAYED ON A SCRATCHY TAPE) </p><p>CONTRIBUTED TO THE FESTIVE, RELAXED </p><p>ATMOSPHERE.  XANANA CALLED THE PROCEEDINGS </p><p>"OUR FIRST STATE VISIT." </p><p> </p><p>U.S. WANTS TO HELP </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) FOLLOWING BRIEF REMARKS BY XANANA AND </p><p>OTHERS IN THE LOCAL TETUN LANGUAGE, AMBASSADOR </p><p>HOLBROOKE WAS ASKED TO SPEAK.  HOLBROOKE </p><p>SALUTED THE EAST TIMORESE FOR HAVING ACHIEVED </p><p>PEACE AND FREEDOM AFTER A LONG AND COURAGEOUS </p><p>STRUGGLE AND DREW APPLAUSE WITH HIS REMARK </p><p>THAT EAST TIMOR WOULD SOON BE THE FIRST NEW </p><p>NATION OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY.  HOLBROOKE </p><p>RECALLED THAT HE HAD JUST SEEN THE REFUGEES IN </p><p>WEST TIMOR, WHO WERE BEING TOLD LIES ABOUT THE </p><p>SITUATION IN EAST TIMOR.  HOLBROOKE ADDED THAT </p><p>IF ONLY THE REFUGEES IN WEST TIMOR COULD SEE </p><p>THIS PEACEFUL SCENE IN AILEU, THEY WOULD </p><p>RETURN.  WHILE THE EAST TIMORESE HAD GAINED </p><p>THEIR FREEDOM THEMSELVES, THE U.S. AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WANTED TO HELP IN </p><p>CREATING A NEW STABLE DEMOCRACY.  THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP MUST COME FROM THE EAST TIMORESE </p><p>THEMSELVES, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>A NEW SITUATION IN JAKARTA </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MOVING TO XANANA\'S CURRENT RESIDENCE </p><p>FOR A MORE PRIVATE DISCUSSION, HOLBROOKE AND </p><p>A/S ROTH STRESSED TO XANANA THAT HE WAS NOW </p><p>DEALING WITH A VERY DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>JAKARTA, ONE WHICH STILL INCLUDED SOME BAD </p><p>ELEMENTS BUT WHICH ALSO HAD A PRESIDENT AND </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER WHO WERE STRESSING TOLERANCE, </p><p>AND AN ATTORNEY GENERAL ANXIOUS TO INVESTIGATE </p><p>THE ABUSES IN EAST TIMOR TO DEMONSTRATE THAT </p><p>INDONESIA HAS CHANGED.  HOLBROOKE URGED XANANA </p><p>TO REMEMBER THAT HE HAD SOME FRIENDS IN </p><p>JAKARTA, INCLUDING PRESIDENT WAHID.  XANANA </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT HE WAS MEETING PRESIDENT WAHID </p><p>IN JAKARTA ON NOVEMBER 30. </p><p> </p><p>FOCUS ON REFUGEES </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) HOLBROOKE TOLD XANANA THAT THERE WERE </p><p>FOUR ISSUES DRIVING THE INDONESIA/EAST TIMOR </p><p>DYNAMIC: THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN JAKARTA </p><p>BETWEEN THE REFORMERS AND THE STATUS QUO </p><p>SUPPORTERS; THE SITUATION IN WEST TIMOR, WHERE </p><p>AT LEAST ONE-EIGHTH OF THE EAST TIMORESE </p><p>POPULATION REMAINED TRAPPED; THE CNRT\'S </p><p>RELATIONS WITH JAKARTA; AND THE ACEH </p><p>SITUATION.  HOLBROOKE SAID THE FOCUS OF HIS </p><p>TRIP HAD BEEN THE PEOPLE IN THE CAMPS IN WEST </p><p>TIMOR.  DISINFORMATION AND INTIMIDATION WERE </p><p>PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM RETURNING HOME.  IN ONE </p><p>INSTANCE, THREE DAYS AGO, 1000 REFUGEES HAD </p><p>SIGNED UP TO DEPART AND ONLY 350 SHOWED UP, A </p><p>CLEAR INDICATION OF THE SCALE OF INTIMIDATION. </p><p> </p><p>NEED TO GET MESSAGE OUT </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) HOLBROOKE TOLD XANANA THAT HE MUST </p><p>URGENTLY BROADCAST HIS MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE </p><p>IN THE CAMPS VIA ALL POSSIBLE MEANS AND </p><p>ADVISED HIM TO INSIST TO THE GOI DURING HIS </p><p>UPCOMING VISIT TO JAKARTA THAT THERE WOULD BE </p><p>NO GOOD RELATIONS UNTIL THE CAMPS WERE </p><p>CLEARED.  (COMMENT:  AT HOLBROOKE\'S URGING, </p><p>XANANA CONVEYED SUCH A MESSAGE URGING REFUGEES </p><p>NOT TO BELIEVE RUMORS OF CONTINUING CONFLICT </p><p>IN EAST TIMOR AND ASSURING THEM THEY HAD </p><p>NOTHING TO FEAR, VIA THE MEDIA COVERING THIS </p><p>EVENT.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>AGREEMENT RAISES PRESSURE ON GOI </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) XANANA EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT A DEAL TO </p><p>PERMIT THE REFUGEES TO RETURN MIGHT FORCE HIS </p><p>PEOPLE "TO ACCEPT THE MILITIA COMMANDERS AS IF </p><p>NOTHING HAD HAPPENED."  HOLBROOKE ASSURED </p><p>XANANA THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED AT THE BORDER </p><p>ON NOVEMBER 22 DID NOT REQUIRE XANANA TO MAKE </p><p>ANY SUCH DEAL. HOLBROOKE ADDED THAT HIS PARTY </p><p>HAD UPPED THE PRESSURE ON THE INDONESIAN </p><p>MILITARY BY TAKING THEM INTO THE CAMPS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY THE INDONESIAN AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESS.  WHILE IT REMAINED TO BE </p><p>SEEN WHETHER THE INDONESIAN COMMITMENTS WOULD BE </p><p>IMPLEMENTED, THE CAMP VISIT WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP </p><p>WHICH RAISED THE PRESSURE ON THE INDONESIANS. </p><p> </p><p>A FASTER TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE? </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE ASKED XANANA IF </p><p>HE HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHEN INDEPENDENCE </p><p>SHOULD BE ACHIEVED.  XANANA SAID HIS AND HIS </p><p>ADVISORS\' CURRENT THINKING WAS "WHY WAIT SUCH </p><p>A LONG TIME?"  XANANA ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>EASIER AND FASTER FOR AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO ARRIVE AT STRATEGIC DECISIONS </p><p>THAN IS THE CASE WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION OF </p><p>CONFUSING MANDATES. (COMMENT. ON NOVEMBER 22 </p><p>ACTING UNTAET DEPUTY DAVID HARLAND TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT TOP UNTAET OFFICIALS ALSO WERE SERIOUSLY </p><p>CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF A QUICKER </p><p>TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE THAN ORIGINALLY </p><p>ENVISIONED.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>TIMING IMPORTANT </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE SAID THE FIRST </p><p>ISSUE IS FOR THE EAST TIMORESE TO BUILD UP THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEM. THEN </p><p>THEY CAN DECIDE WHEN TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>MEMBER OF THE UN.  XANANA AND DE MELLO MUST </p><p>CONSULT CLOSELY TO ARRIVE AT THIS DECISION. </p><p>THE U.S. WOULD SUPPORT WHATEVER WAS DECIDED </p><p>AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE BEFORE AND AFTER </p><p>INDEPENDENCE.  TIMING WAS IMPORTANT: WAITING </p><p>TOO LONG WOULD PROVOKE RESISTANCE WHILE MOVING </p><p>TO INDEPENDENCE BEFORE EAST TIMOR WAS PREPARED </p><p>ALSO WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.  XANANA </p><p>SAID THAT PRESENT UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING </p><p>HUMAN RESOURCES COMPLICATED ANY DECISION ON </p><p>TIMING FOR INDEPENDENCE.  AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE </p><p>SAID THAT WHILE NO DECISION NEED BE MADE RIGHT </p><p>AWAY, IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BEGIN FOCUSSING ON </p><p>THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE UN\'S TIMETABLE FOR THE </p><p>TRANSITION WOULD BE A KEY DETERMINING FACTOR </p><p>IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>WHICH CURRENCY? </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE\'S </p><p>QUERY, XANANA SAID THAT "FOR POLITICAL </p><p>REASONS" THE CNRT WAS CONSIDERING USING THE </p><p>PORTUGUESE ESCUDO AS EAST TIMOR\'S CURRENCY. </p><p>HOLBROOKE POINTED OUT THAT THE ESCUDO WOULD BE </p><p>REPLACED BY THE EURO IN ANOTHER 18 MONTHS AND </p><p>HE SUGGESTED THAT A DECISION ON CURRENCY BE </p><p>LEFT TO THE TECHNICAL EXPERTS.  XANANA SAID </p><p>THE IMF HAD BEEN AMENABLE TO USING THE </p><p>AUSTRALIAN OR SINGAPORE DOLLAR OR THE RUPIAH. </p><p> </p><p>FUTURE GOVERNANCE </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE ASKED ABOUT PLANS FOR A </p><p>GOVERNING COUNCIL DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. </p><p>XANANA SAID HE AND SRSG DE MELLO (WHO ARRIVED FROM </p><p>DILI TO JOIN THE MEETING AT THIS POINT) HAD AGREED IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE ON A TRANSITION ADVISORY COUNCIL.  XANANA </p><p>SAID THE CNRT WOULD DISBAND AT INDEPENDENCE WITH THE </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES BECOMING THE MAIN ACTORS. </p><p> </p><p>GELBARD </p><p></p></div>
