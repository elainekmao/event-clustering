He reacted negatively to the argument </p><p>that it was critical for the LTTE to do more. </p><p>Ponnambalam\'s comments shed light on the peace process\' </p><p>current difficulties.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Meeting with Senior Tamil MP </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador Wills met March 5 with Gajendrakumar </p><p>"Gajen" Ponnambalam, a senior MP for the Tamil National </p><p>Alliance (TNA) representing Jaffna.  Ponnambalam, 28, a </p><p>lawyer by profession, was elected to Parliament for the </p><p>first time in December 2001 and is the scion of an </p><p>important Tamil political family.  He inherited </p><p>leadership of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC), a </p><p>constituent element of the TNA, from his father, Kumar, </p><p>who was killed under mysterious circumstances in </p><p>January 2000.  Ponnambalam told the Ambassador that he </p><p>was certain that former deputy defense minister </p><p>Anuruddha Ratwatte had a hand in arranging the slaying. </p><p>(Note:  The investigation into the murder of Kumar </p><p>Ponnambalam is continuing.  Ratwatte, a relative of the </p><p>president\'s, is currently being tried in a separate case </p><p>involving multiple homicide.)  Ponnambalam\'s </p><p>grandfather, G.G, was also well-known.  In the mid- </p><p>1940\'s, G.G. founded the ACTC, which was the first Tamil </p><p>political party in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) While young for a Sri Lankan politician, </p><p>Ponnambalam is articulate, intelligent, and has an </p><p>impressive presence.  Because of his abilities and </p><p>background, he is considered an up-and-comer in the </p><p>Tamil political leadership.  Per the comments that </p><p>follow, while he is not overtly pro-LTTE, he tends to </p><p>parrot some of the group\'s views.  As is the case with </p><p>many other Tamil politicians, it is not clear whether </p><p>this is out of true belief, or from fear of retribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Peace Process Gets Negative Reviews </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) When asked, Ponnambalam gave a thumbs down on </p><p>the current state of the peace process.  In doing so, he </p><p>laid blame squarely on the government\'s lap, asserting </p><p>that it had to make much more progress on the following </p><p>two issues, among many others: </p><p> </p><p>-- Security forces in Jaffna:  Ponnambalam said the </p><p>government was not moving quickly enough to diminish the </p><p>presence of its security forces in Jaffna.  He </p><p>understood that the government had to maintain a </p><p>security presence, but the GSL had to do more for </p><p>civilians in the Jaffna area.  The security zones were </p><p>too large and civilians needed their property rights </p><p>restored.  It was positive that the GSL had given </p><p>indications that it was willing to move forward with </p><p>resettlement outside of the zones, but much, much more </p><p>had to be done. </p><p> </p><p>-- Fishing:  The government had to do more to lift </p><p>fishing restrictions.  Although the February 2001 </p><p>ceasefire accord had required the government to lift </p><p>most restrictions by "D-Day plus 90 days) (i.e., late </p><p>May 2001), the GSL had not done all it had to do.  Many </p><p>fishing boats, for example, were being prevented from </p><p>returning to port at night.  Because the boats were </p><p>often small, this created serious dangers for Tamil </p><p>fishermen, who had to stay out in the sea all night. </p><p>(Note:  Although we have not asked the GSL about this </p><p>specific issue, the military, for good reason, is </p><p>fearful of giving too much leeway to Tamil fishing </p><p>boats.  The LTTE sometimes uses the boats to bring in </p><p>arms, for example.  At the same time, with many Tamils </p><p>in the north and east reliant on the fishing industry, </p><p>the government has to approach the issue cautiously.) </p><p>----------- </p><p>Tiger Views </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador asked about the views of the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) toward the peace </p><p>process, noting news reports that TNA politicians had </p><p>met with Tiger leaders in late February.  Ponnambalam </p><p>confirmed that he had attended the meeting, which took </p><p>place in the LTTE-controlled Wanni region in north- </p><p>central Sri Lanka.  S.P. Thamilchelvam, the chief of the </p><p>LTTE\'s political wing, and Ilamparuthi, the group\'s </p><p>Jaffna political coordinator, represented the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Ponnambalam said the LTTE officials had used the </p><p>meeting to underscore that the group remained fully </p><p>committed to the ceasefire and had no desire or </p><p>intention of returning to war.  That said, they were </p><p>very negative about the current state of the peace </p><p>process.  They related that the LTTE had taken a series </p><p>of difficult steps in past months that had helped move </p><p>the peace process forward.  Despite its long-standing </p><p>stance, for example, the group had decided not to press </p><p>for an interim administration in the north and east.  In </p><p>agreeing to this, the LTTE had listened to the </p><p>government, which had argued that going for an interim </p><p>setup at this time would be politically difficult to </p><p>sell in the south.  In addition, the LTTE had decided to </p><p>come out in support of federalism, despite its </p><p>discomfort with that term given its long-time support </p><p>for the "Eelam" (separate Tamil state) concept.  In </p><p>spite of all this, the group felt that the GSL had not </p><p>fully reciprocated and that was the crux of the peace </p><p>process\' current problems.  (Note:  Although Ponnambalam </p><p>did not specifically mention it, the Tigers have also </p><p>been vociferously complaining that the government is not </p><p>doing enough to funnel economic assistance into the </p><p>north and east, and especially to LTTE-controlled </p><p>regions.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) When asked by the Ambassador, Ponnambalam </p><p>defended the LTTE\'s stance toward the reopening of the </p><p>Jaffna library.  (Note:  Last month, reacting to </p><p>pressure from the LTTE, local Tamil politicians decided </p><p>to postpone the reopening of the library -- see </p><p>Reftels.)  Ponnambalam commented that the LTTE felt that </p><p>the government had not finished construction of the </p><p>library, which, given its symbolic importance to Tamil </p><p>people, they felt should only be opened when fully </p><p>complete.  Ponnambalam denied that the group had used </p><p>any coercion to get its way on the issue.  (Note:  There </p><p>have been many reports that the LTTE threatened senior </p><p>TNA MP and leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front </p><p>V. Anandasangaree over the issue, for example. </p><p>Anandasangaree has denied these reports, but seems to be </p><p>spending a lot of time outside of Sri Lanka of late.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>A North/East Divide in the LTTE? </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>8.  (C) In an interesting aside, Ponnambalam remarked </p><p>that in his estimation the LTTE high command\'s </p><p>positioning on the peace process was being strongly </p><p>influenced by the views of its eastern cadre at this </p><p>time.  Ponnambalam said the eastern cadre were more </p><p>hard-line toward the peace process than cadre in the </p><p>north and did not support compromise.  He explained that </p><p>this north/east division in the LTTE was understandable </p><p>given the ongoing communal tensions in the east, which </p><p>were more pervasive and potentially more destabilizing </p><p>than those in the north.  While a strong leader, LTTE </p><p>chief V. Prabhakaran, a northerner, was probably </p><p>reluctant to press cadre in the east too much regarding </p><p>the peace process.  In taking this position, Prabhakaran </p><p>was trying not to accentuate the north/east divide, </p><p>especially given the long-standing resentment of eastern </p><p>Tamils, who felt that northerners treated them in a </p><p>second-class manner. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>A Negative Riff </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In response to Ponnambalam\'s litany of </p><p>complaints, the Ambassador noted that the GSL was not </p><p>perfect, but it was critical to the future of Sri Lanka </p><p>that the LTTE work with it.  In doing this, it was vital </p><p>that the LTTE make some sort of gesture showing that it </p><p>was still on board with the peace process.  A sour mood </p><p>was developing in many quarters and it was important </p><p>that the LTTE do something soon.  It was up to the LTTE </p><p>to decide what it should do, but it had to make clear to </p><p>those in the south that it had forsworn violence and the </p><p>use of terrorism.  No one was asking the group to disarm </p><p>totally, but the fact that it had not gotten rid of its </p><p>"Black Tiger" (suicide squad units), for example, was </p><p>abominable. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) In response, Ponnambalam went on a long and </p><p>largely negative riff, the gist of which was that Tamils </p><p>and the LTTE were in no mood to compromise at this time. </p><p>It was up to the south to do something to show its </p><p>sincerity.  Tamils could not trust southerners; they had </p><p>shown countless times in the past that they were willing </p><p>to undermine past peace initiatives.  Even within the </p><p>current government, only the Prime Minister and several </p><p>other ministers routinely spoke out in favor of the </p><p>peace process -- the rest were quiet.  Until the south </p><p>reached some consensus, it would be difficult for </p><p>progress to be made.  The Ambassador remarked that </p><p>complete consensus in the south would be difficult to </p><p>achieve.  In dealing with its political opponents in the </p><p>south, it would help the GSL, which supported peace, if </p><p>the LTTE showed some more give.  Ponnambalam took the </p><p>Ambassador\'s points on board, commenting that he would </p><p>try to reflect such views when he met with LTTE leaders </p><p>on March 7.  (Note:  Visiting chief LTTE negotiator </p><p>Anton Balasingham has scheduled a meeting in the Wanni </p><p>with Tamil politicians on that date.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Ponnambalam\'s comments shed light on the peace </p><p>process\' current difficulties.  Clearly, based on his </p><p>comments and those of other observers, the LTTE is not </p><p>in the mood at this time to compromise with a south it </p><p>does not fully trust.  At the same time, some in the </p><p>south are making increasingly strident comments that the </p><p>LTTE cannot be trusted and the peace process is a waste </p><p>of time.  Given these conflicting views, which mutually </p><p>reinforce hard-liners in each camp, the peace process is </p><p>in a bit of a trough after a surge of optimism last </p><p>year.  Perhaps Balasingham\'s current visit and the </p><p>upcoming visit of a high-level Norwegian facilitation </p><p>team can breathe some new life into the situation.  The </p><p>Ambassador also plans to visit Jaffna next week to size </p><p>up the situation there.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
