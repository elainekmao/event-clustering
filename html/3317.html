SOME </p><p>ACTIVISTS REPORT THAT THEY FACE PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY </p><p>CONTACTING FOREIGNERS BOTH IN VIETNAM AND OVERSEAS, AND </p><p>THAT THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT </p><p>FROM OVERSEAS.  AT LEAST ONE CRITIC MAINTAINS OPTIMISM THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT WILL "CHANGE" (SOMEHOW) IN TIME, BUT ALSO </p><p>PREDICTS THAT "NEW PEOPLE" WILL BE REQUIRED TO REALIZE ANY </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  VIETNAMESE DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS SENT BY MAIL A </p><p>LETTER DATED JULY 6, 2002 TO VIETNAM\'S TOP FOUR LEADERS </p><p>(PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG, COMMUNIST PARTY GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH, PRIME MINISTER PHAN VAN KHAI, AND </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN NGUYEN VAN AN) AND, INDIRECTLY </p><p>BY EMAIL ON JULY 10, TO INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, PRESS FREEDOM ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER </p><p>INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING POLOFF.

PHAM HONG SON, AND HAS RECENTLY WRITTEN AT </p><p>LEAST ONE OTHER WIDELY DISTRIBUTED LETTER CALLING FOR THE </p><p>RELEASE OF HER HUSBAND.  (SEPTEL REPORTS ON SON\'S CURRENT </p><p>STATUS.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE JULY 6 LETTER CRITICIZED "POLITICAL SECURITY </p><p>FORCES" FOR THEIR ACTIONS AGAINST VARIOUS INDIVIDUALS, </p><p>INCLUDING SOME OF THE SIGNATORIES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS, </p><p>FROM APRIL 2001 TO THE PRESENT.  THE LETTER CONCLUDED WITH </p><p>FOUR SUGGESTIONS:  1) THE POLITBURO SHOULD HOLD A </p><p>CONFERENCE ON SECURITY FORCE ADMINISTRATION TO PREVENT </p><p>ABUSES; 2) ACTIVISTS NGUYEN KHAC TOAN, LE CHI QUANG, AND </p><p>PHAM HONG SON SHOULD EITHER BE TRIED OR RELEASED SOON; 3) </p><p>DECREE 31/CP ON ADMINISTRATIVE PROBATION SHOULD BE REPEALED </p><p>AND BUI MINH QUOC, TRAN KHUE, AND HA SY PHU (ALL CURRENTLY </p><p>UNDER ADMINISTRATIVE PROBATION) SHOULD BE SET FREE; AND 4) </p><p>THE AUTHORITIES SHOULD RECONNECT THE PHONE LINES OF </p><p>ACTIVISTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  DR. NGUYEN THANG GIANG, ONE OF THE SIGNATORIES, </p><p>CONFIRMED TO POL/C AND POLOFF ON JULY 12 THAT THE LETTER </p><p>WAS TIMED TO CORRESPOND WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM </p><p>(CPV) CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S SIXTH PLENUM AS WELL AS THE </p><p>IMMINENT OPENING OF THE 11TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  HE ADDED </p><p>THAT THE ACTIVISTS ALSO TARGETED A UN COMMISSION ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS DISCUSSION ON VIETNAM ABOUT WHICH THEY HAD LEARNED </p><p>FROM VOICE OF AMERICA (VOA) AND RADIO FREE ASIA (RFA). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01794  01 OF 04  161046Z </p><p>(NOTE:  WE ARE UNAWARE OF THIS MEETING.  END NOTE.)  WHILE </p><p>DR. GIANG SPECULATED THAT THE LETTER WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>DISCUSSED AT THE PLENUM, HE ADMITTED THAT HE DID NOT EXPECT </p><p>TO SEE ANY RESULTS.  HE CONFIRMED THAT THERE HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>ANY REPERCUSSIONS AGAINST THE ACTIVISTS SINCE THEY HAD SENT </p><p>THE LETTER.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE SEVENTEEN SIGNATORIES </p><p>HAD NOT MET TOGETHER, BUT HAD PASSED AROUND THE LETTER FROM </p><p>ONE HAND TO THE NEXT, WITH TRAN KHUE (CURRENTLY DETAINED IN </p><p>HIS HOME IN HO CHI MINH CITY) PARTICIPATING BY TELEPHONE. </p><p>DR. GIANG ADDED THAT FELLOW ACTIVIST PHAM QUE DUONG WAS </p><p>SEPARATELY WRITING LETTERS ABOUT THE NAM CAM CORRUPTION </p><p>CASE AND THE VIETNAM-CHINA BORDER ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  RETIRED COLONEL PHAM QUE DUONG (REF A), SEPARATELY </p><p>NOTED TO POLOFF ON JULY 15 THAT HE DID NOT EXPECT ANY </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE JULY 6 LETTER.  HOWEVER, HE EXPRESSED </p><p>OPTIMISM THAT VIETNAM\'S LEADERSHIP WOULD "CHANGE" </p><p>RELATIVELY SOON. A HOPEFUL SIGN OF CHANGE, DUONG SAID, WAS </p><p>THAT THE VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY (VNA) HAD ON MARCH 1 PUBLISHED </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S FEBRUARY 22 ADDRESS AT CHINA\'S TSINGHUA </p><p>UNIVERSITY, INCLUDING REFERENCES TO THE RULE OF LAW AND </p><p>POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. </p><p> </p><p>7.

COLONEL DUONG REMARKED THAT IT REMAINS </p><p>DIFFICULT TO CONTACT FOREIGN JOURNALISTS.  HE SAID THAT HE </p><p>AND FELLOW ACTIVISTS NGUYEN VU BINH, HOANG TIEN, AND DR. </p><p>GIANG HAVE DIVIDED UP RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTACTING </p><p>DIFFERENT NEWS SERVICES AND OVERSEAS INTEREST GROUPS, </p><p>NOTING THAT HE WAS THE "REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS (RSF)" </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE FOR VIETNAM.  COLONEL DUONG CLAIMED THAT, </p><p>WHILE FOREIGN PRESS ORGANIZATIONS ARE WILLING TO PAY HIM </p><p>AND FELLOW ACTIVISTS FOR STORIES THEY PROVIDE, THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAVE BLOCKED WIRE TRANSFERS INTO THE ACTIVISTS\' </p><p>BANK ACCOUNTS AND/OR PREVENTED THEM FROM OPENING NEW BANK </p><p>ACCOUNTS.  HE SAID THAT, IF HE COULD BECOME AFFILIATED WITH </p><p>AN OVERSEAS COMPANY, HE COULD OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM. </p><p>(NOTE:  SEPTEL REPORTS THAT THE GVN IS INVESTIGATING DR. </p><p>PHAM HONG SON, A REPRESENTATIVE FOR A FOREIGN </p><p>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, IN PART, FOR RECEIVING MONEY FROM </p><p>OVERSEAS FOR "ANTI-STATE" ACTIVITIES.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COLONEL DUONG GAVE POLOFF COPIES OF THREE LETTERS </p><p>ON CORRUPTION THAT HE HAS WRITTEN SINCE JUNE BUT HAS NOT </p><p>BEEN ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE OVERSEAS YET.  HE SAID THAT HE </p><p>USUALLY SENDS SUCH LETTERS FROM INTERNET CAFES EITHER </p><p>HIMSELF, OR THROUGH HIS NIECES AND NEPHEWS.  HOWEVER, HE </p><p>EXPLAINED, THE POLICE HAVE FOLLOWED THEM CLOSELY IN RECENT </p><p>WEEKS AND THEY HAVE THUS NOT TRIED TO SEND THE LETTERS. </p><p> </p><p>UNOFFICIAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF JULY 6 LETTER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>9.

THE RESILIENCE OF THE AWARENESS OF </p><p>CITIZEN\'S RESPONSIBILITY, OF EARNEST IDEAS NECESSARY FOR </p><p>THE TRUE REFORM, WHEN BEING DEPRESSED, NOT ONLY MAKES THE </p><p>SOCIETY UNABLE TO DEVELOP WELL BUT ALSO NOURISHES DANGERS </p><p>THAT CAUSE COLLAPSE.
