(C) SUMMARY.  ARMED WITH AN EVIDENT PRESIDENT BUSH-PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI UNDERSTANDING THAT UNILATERAL TRADE </p><p>ACTIONS SHOULD BE AVOIDED, ITALY IS LOOKING TO DAMPEN EC AND </p><p>MEMBER STATE CALLS FOR STEEL RETALIATION.  ITALY\'S ALTERNATE </p><p>133 REPRESENTATIVE, HOWEVER, TOLD VISITING EB ASSISTAMT </p><p>SECRETARY PRIOR TO THE 31 MAY 133 COMMITTEE MEETING THAT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>COOLING THE EC WOULD REQUIRE DEMONSTRABLE PROGRESS IN EC-USG </p><p>TALKS.  ITALY\'S 133 TITULAIRE TOLD ECOUNS ON 4 JUNE THAT </p><p>"PROGRESS" MEANS REGULAR USG ANNOUNCEMENTS OF EXCLUSIONS, </p><p>GOOD-FAITH NEGOTIATIONS ON COMPENSATION, AND A SHORTENING OF </p><p>THE THREE-YEAR LIFE OF USG SAFEGUARDS.  HE CONFIRMED REPORTS </p><p>THAT THE EU WOULD TECHNICALLY SUSPEND U.S. CONCESSIONS ON 17 </p><p>JUNE BUT DISMISSED THIS DEVELOPMENT AS A TECHNICAL MEASURE. </p><p>POST RECOMMENDS THAT WASHINGTON AGENCIES BEAR IN MIND THAT </p><p>THE PRESIDENT BUSH-PM BERLUSCONI UNDERSTANDING MAY PROVE </p><p>USEFUL AS THE STEEL CASE MOVES ALONG.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DURING 30 MAY MEETINGS WITH PRIME MINISTER DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISOR GIOVANNI CASTELLANETA AND MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR EU </p><p>AFFAIRS ROCCO CANGELOSI, VISITING EB ASSISTANT SECRETARY TONY </p><p>WAYNE AND ECONOFF WELCOMED INDICATIONS THAT PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p>AND PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI HAD AGREED DURING THEIR 27 MAY </p><p>BILATERAL THAT UNILATERAL TRADE ACTIONS WERE INADVISABLE. </p><p>CASTELLANETA AND CANGELOSI BOTH INDICATED THAT BERLUSCONI HAD </p><p>ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT ITALY SHOULD WORK TO CALM THE DISPUTE </p><p>OVER STEEL.  DURING A MEETING LATER ON 30 MAY, SANDRO </p><p>FANELLA, GOI ALTERNATIVE REPRESENTATIVE TO THE EU\'S 133 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02706  051052Z </p><p>COMMITTEE, CONFIRMED THAT THE GOI PARTICULARLY WANTS TO AVOID </p><p>UNILATERAL EU ACTION IN THE STEEL CASE.  DURING THAT 30 MAY </p><p>MEETING AND A 4 JUNE CONVERSATION BETWEEN ECOUNS AND GOI 133 </p><p>COMMITTEE TITULAIRE MARIO GERBINO, SANDWICHED AROUND THE 31 </p><p>MAY 133 COMMITTEE MEETING, THE ITALIANS LAID OUT THEIR VIEW </p><p>OF HOW EVENTS NEED TO PLAY OUT IN ORDER TO OBVIATE UNILATERAL </p><p>EU RETALIATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) FANELLA AND GERBINO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED BY EC LAWYERS </p><p>THAT THE EU MUST TAKE SOME AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BY 17 JUNE TO </p><p>AVOID WAIVING ARTICLE 8.2 RIGHTS.  GERBINO SAID THIS DECISION </p><p>HAS BEEN TAKEN AND WOULD BE ANNOUNCED AT THE 17 JUNE GENERAL </p><p>AFFAIRS COUNCIL MEETING.  BUT HE QUICKLY ADDED THAT THE </p><p>EFFECT WOULD BE MINIMAL: CONCESSIONS WOULD BE SUSPENDED, BUT </p><p>THERE WOULD FOLLOW AN IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION OF THE SUSPENSION. </p><p> GERBINO\'S SENSE OF THE 31 MAY MEETING WAS THAT MOST MEMBER </p><p>STATES WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOREGO UNILATERAL RETALIATION, </p><p>ASSUMING EU RIGHTS WERE PRESERVED TO THEIR SATISFACTION, </p><p>PROVIDED EU-USG SETTLEMENT TALKS WERE PROGRESSING. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) GOING INTO THE 31 MAY MEETING FANELLA STILL HOPED THAT </p><p>EU-USG PROGRESS WOULD TAKE THE FORM OF COMPENSATION OR </p><p>REBALANCING.  A/S WAYNE DID NOT DISABUSE HIM BUT PUSHED THE </p><p>DISCUSSION TOWARDS THE EXCLUSION PROCESS AND NOTED THAT THERE </p><p>WAS NO WTO PRECEDENCE FOR COMPENSATION.  COMING OUT OF THE </p><p>133 COMMITTEE MEETING, GERBINO HAD MORE DEFINITIVE BENCHMARKS </p><p>FOR MEASURING NEGOTIATION PROGRESS.  HE SAID THAT THE EC </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES SAID THEY HAD BEEN ASSURED BY THE USG THAT </p><p>WEEKLY EXCLUSION ANNOUNCEMENTS WOULD BE INSTITUTED IN THE </p><p>NEAR FUTURE.  HE STILL EXPECTS USG MOVEMENTS ON COMPENSATION. </p><p> WHEN ECOUNS REITERATED THAT THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02706  051052Z </p><p>COMPENSATION IN A SAFEGUARDS CASE, GERBINO REPLIED, "THERE\'S </p><p>ALWAYS A FIRST TIME."  FINALLY, HE SAID THE EC WILL BE </p><p>LOOKING FOR THE USG TO SHORTEN THE THREE-YEAR LIFE OF OUR </p><p>SAFEGUARDS.  WITHOUT HANDICAPPING HOW MUCH PROGRESS ON EACH </p><p>BENCHMARK WOULD SUFFICE TO ALLOW THE EU TO CONTINUE TO STAND </p><p>DOWN FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF RETALIATION, GERBINO SAID HE IS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT IMPLEMENTATION COULD BE DELAYED UNTIL AT LEAST </p><p>OCTOBER. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT. THE ITALIANS CLEARLY ARE LOOKING FOR A FIG </p><p>LEAF THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE WITHIN THE </p><p>EU FOR MODERATION (REFS A AND B) PER PM BERLUSCONI\'S WISHES. </p><p>WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE IMPORTANT OPENING CREATED </p><p>BY PRESIDENT BUSH\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PM, WHICH MAY MEAN </p><p>GETTING THE PM\'S OFFICE AND MFA TO KEEP PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>DEPUTY MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE.  IF, AS GERBINO BELIEVES, A </p><p>USG DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO ANNOUNCE EXCLUSIONS ON A </p><p>WEEKLY BASIS, THIS SHOULD SUFFICE FOR ITALY\'S PURPOSES FOR </p><p>THE TIME BEING.  ON THE OTHER HAND, IF </p><p>COMPENSATION/REBALANCING TALKS BECOME STUCK, THE ITALIANS </p><p>WILL BEGIN TO LOOK FOR USG MOVEMENT ON THE REMAINING </p><p>BENCHMARK -- THE DURATION OF OUR SAFEGUARDS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  A/S WAYNE CLEARED ON THIS MESSAGE. </p><p>POPE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02706 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
