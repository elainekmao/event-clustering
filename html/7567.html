(U) Local press reported on April 18 that the </p><p>Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs has developed a </p><p>new inspection and training plan centered on improving </p><p>the quality of labor inspection. The objective of the </p><p>program is to create safer and more secure working </p><p>conditions by encouraging companies to comply more </p><p>strictly with current labor regulations.  The new </p><p>inspection plan also better conforms with the </p><p>International Labour Organization\'s Labour Inspection </p><p>Convention No. 81. The plan envisages hiring 440 new </p><p>labor inspectors by the end of 2005, technical </p><p>training for inspectors in line with international </p><p>standards, developing their ability to advise the </p><p>companies being inspected on the most effective means </p><p>of complying with the labor law, and increased </p><p>automation of the inspection process by utilizing </p><p>high-tech equipment. The UAE labor law requires that </p><p>companies be inspected twice annually or as often as </p><p>necessary to ensure the effective application of </p><p>regulations. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment: This new inspection plan </p><p>demonstrates a continuing commitment on part of the </p><p>UAEG to comply with international labor standards.  It </p><p>also comes on the heels of the disappointing amnesty </p><p>program which so far has failed to live up to </p><p>expectations.  (See reftel).  Though the proposed </p><p>program is ostensibly about improving labor conditions </p><p>and transferring technical knowledge from inspectors </p><p>to businesses, an important secondary consideration of </p><p>inspections is cracking down on illegal workers who do </p><p>not take advantage of the amnesty.  By publicizing </p><p>broadly the intentions of the government to implement </p><p>a comprehensive new inspection plan, the Ministry is </p><p>also broadcasting loudly that it intends to crack down </p><p>on illegal labor and the companies that hire such </p><p>workers.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
