Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand has said that </p><p>progress is being achieved peace talks have still not begun </p><p>between the Government of Nepal (GON) and the Maoists since </p><p>the arrival in Kathmandu a week ago of the Maoist </p><p>negotiating team.  After being underground for seven years, </p><p>members of the Maoist negotiation team, headed by Dr. </p><p>Baburam Bhattarai, wasted no time in exploiting the </p><p>extensive media coverage of their surfacing, including </p><p>sharing a platform with Prime Minister Chand, and addressing </p><p>a mass gathering in Kathmandu.  Bhattarai said there would </p><p>be no compromise on the Maoist demands of a constituent </p><p>assembly, interim government and round-table conference. </p><p>The Maoist ideologue asserted that his party had enough </p><p>strength to overthrow the government at any time, and warned </p><p>of serious consequences if the peace talks fail.  Bhattarai </p><p>again criticized the GON for not forming its negotiating </p><p>team or creating the right environment for peace talks. </p><p>However, while professing to be ready to sit at any time for </p><p>peace talks, the Maoists have insisted on new conditions </p><p>that must be met before they will participate even in </p><p>preliminary "goodwill talks."  The Maoist negotiating team </p><p>kept a busy schedule all week, meeting with leaders of the </p><p>major political parties, but their contradictory rhetoric </p><p>throughout the week caused many to question whether the </p><p>Maoists truly know what they want.  For their part, </p><p>representatives of the GON have been low-key this week while </p><p>Bhattarai monopolizes the press.  Prime Minister Chand </p><p>allegedly has delayed the filing of cases against the </p><p>Maoists arrested for the murders of Krishna Mohan Shrestha, </p><p>Inspector General of the Armed Police Force, his wife and </p><p>bodyguard (Reftel).  Accusations of code of conduct </p><p>violations continued, with the insurgents\' alleged extortion </p><p>attempts and physical violence, and arrests by security </p><p>personnel of Maoist cadres. </p><p> </p><p>TALKS STILL NOT UNDERWAY </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  Despite the arrival a week ago of the Maoist negotiating </p><p>team, peace talks have still not begun.  Starting dates of </p><p>April 1 and April 3, given by Narayan Singh Pun, government- </p><p>appointed peace talks coordinator, were canceled because the </p><p>Maoists allegedly were too busy.  Pun reportedly has </p><p>proposed a new date of April 7 for "goodwill talks."  The </p><p>Maoists, who have claimed publicly that they are ready to </p><p>sit down at any time to begin talks, have insisted on new </p><p>preconditions before they will consider attending any talks. </p><p>Krishan Bahadur Mahara, member of the Maoist negotiating </p><p>team, said talks could now begin only when the GON releases </p><p>the Maoists\' five Central Committee members currently in </p><p>prison, and withdraws the cases filed by the GON in Patan </p><p>Appellate Court against Prachanda and Bhattarai. </p><p> </p><p>BHATTARAI\'S MEDIA CAMPAIGN </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Dr. Baburam Bhattarai and his negotiating team members, </p><p>Ram Bahadur Thapa(alias Badal), Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Dev </p><p>Gurung, and Matrika Prasad Yadav, have taken full advantage </p><p>of the media coverage of their arrival, granting numerous </p><p>interviews with foreign and local media to reiterate the </p><p>Maoist demands of a round-table conference, interim </p><p>government, and constituent assembly.  The Maoist ideologue </p><p>said there would be no compromise from the insurgents on </p><p>these issues.  Bhattarai and his team also addressed a </p><p>public gathering in Kathmandu on April 3, attended by an </p><p>estimated twenty thousand people, many of whom apparently </p><p>attended out of curiosity to see and hear the elusive Maoist </p><p>leaders.  Despite the concessions made by the GON to the </p><p>insurgents, Bhattarai told the crowd that the GON has failed </p><p>to create a favorable environment for successful peace </p><p>talks, and warned of serious consequences if the talks </p><p>failed again.  Badal, who also spoke at the gathering, </p><p>proclaimed that the violence committed by the Maoists was a </p><p>positive thing done in the name of oppressed people, and </p><p>said they were willing to die to create a "new Nepal." </p><p>Badal threatened to return to the jungle and continue the </p><p>"People\'s War" if the GON does not listen to the insurgents </p><p>or take the peace talks seriously. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST PARLEYS WITH POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Bhattarai and his team wasted no time in courting the </p><p>major political parties.  They began meetings within a day </p><p>after their arrival, including sharing a platform with the </p><p>Prime Minister at a Reporter\'s Club function on March 31. </p><p>The Prime Minister reportedly was unaware that Bhattarai had </p><p>been invited also, but nonetheless posed for pictures with </p><p>the Maoist leader.  Bhattarai held meetings with Girija </p><p>Prasad Koirala, President of Nepali Congress (NC), and </p><p>Madhav Kumar Nepal, General Secretary of the Communist Party </p><p>of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) to gain support </p><p>for his party\'s ideas, and to explain the need for a </p><p>constituent assembly to replace the present constitution, </p><p>which he publicly declared was dead.  Bhattarai said he and </p><p>his team would try to arrange meetings also with foreign </p><p>missions. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Despite efforts to win the support of the major </p><p>political parties, several Maoist leaders have spent time </p><p>condemning them.  Matrika Yadav, member of the Maoist </p><p>negotiating team, labeled the Royal Palace, Nepali Congress </p><p>(NC), and the Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist </p><p>Leninists (CPN-UML) as enemies of the Maoists.  Bhattarai </p><p>also declared that the peace talks could only be held </p><p>between the two parties that had armed forces, and therefore </p><p>it would be difficult for the political parties to take </p><p>part, as they had no power.  Bhattarai also lambasted the </p><p>parties for causing a "constitutional deadlock" as a result </p><p>of their power struggles. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The contradictory statements made by the insurgents have </p><p>caused many to question whether the Maoists truly know what </p><p>they want or if they are even serious about peace talks. </p><p>The constant emergence of new demands contrasts with the </p><p>claims by the insurgents that they are ready for peace talks </p><p>to begin.  Ram S. Mahat, senior Nepali Congress (NC) </p><p>activist and former Finance Minister, echoed the thoughts of </p><p>many in a recent editorial when he said the GON appeared to </p><p>be "bending over backwards to appease the Maoists," and </p><p>getting nothing in return.  As Mahat points out, the Maoists </p><p>tactic of raising new demands even in the middle of peace </p><p>talks is reminiscent of the past. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Prime Minister Chand reportedly has delayed the filing </p><p>of charges against the Maoists arrested for the brutal </p><p>murders of Krishna Mohan Shrestha, Inspector General of the </p><p>Armed Police Force, his wife and bodyguard (Reftel). </p><p>According to local press reports, the delay in filing </p><p>appears to be an attempt to avoid upsetting the peace </p><p>process.  Ordinarily, petitions are filed two months after </p><p>investigations are completed.  The GON has not yet given a </p><p>decision on whether or not it will file the petition. </p><p> </p><p>INSURGENTS CONTINUE VIOLENCE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Maoists reportedly have continued to commit ceasefire </p><p>violations throughout Nepal.  The insurgents have halted </p><p>development programs being run in coordination with the </p><p>Nepal Red Cross Society, assaulted a woman for refusing to </p><p>donate to the insurgents, told the staff of district post </p><p>offices not to open during the peace talks, seized land and </p><p>goods from villagers, abducted a Village Development </p><p>Committee (VDC) secretary, and ordered VDC offices to close. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS ARRESTED/RELEASED </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  A Maoist leader carrying ammunition was arrested by </p><p>security personnel, and five other Maoists were re-arrested </p><p>shortly after their release from custody on March 30.  The </p><p>GON released fourteen more Maoist cadres from prison.  The </p><p>GON has said that detainees would be released in phases, </p><p>with additional releases made after the start of peace </p><p>talks. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
