<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000542 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  03/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, PINR, PARM, Political Parties, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRESIDENT KUMARATUNGA PROCLAIMS SHE IS PRO-PEACE, </p><p>PRO-FEDERALISM, PRO-ISH-JVP AND ANTI-UNP </p><p> </p><p>Classified By:  Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons 1.5, B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  President Kumaratunga convoked the </p><p>diplomatic corps on short notice Monday, March 31, to discuss </p><p>current events.  Iraq did not come up.  She assured us all </p><p>that she is for peace and a federal solution and is also </p><p>inclining toward an alliance with the hard left JVP.  She </p><p>also proclaimed her support for the Tokyo Donors Conference. </p><p>And as usual, she trashed the PM and his party.  Afterward, </p><p>she told me she would receive me privately later this week. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) President Kumaratunga returned from abroad on </p><p>Friday, March 28, and convoked all Ambassadors to her </p><p>official residence March 31.  She arrived half an hour late </p><p>and announced she had nothing "dramatic" to say but wanted us </p><p>to have the benefit of her views on current affairs.  In the </p><p>event, she was correct about the lack of drama.  In her </p><p>45-minute presentation, she covered three subjects: </p><p>cohabitation, the economy and peace.  The q\'s and a\'s were </p><p>more interesting. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On cohabitation, the President, as is her custom, </p><p>trashed the PM and his party.  Although she was willing to </p><p>make it work and at all times had acted "with extreme </p><p>restraint and only out of concern for the people", the PM and </p><p>his Cabinet colleagues had behaved "abominably".  She accused </p><p>Ranil of ordering the murder of "60 PA cadre", the torching </p><p>of "over 3,000" PA cadres\' private homes and the "routine" </p><p>mistreatment of her.  Despite this, she remained willing to </p><p>try to make it work but didn\'t think it would.  On the </p><p>economy, she characterized the government\'s policies as </p><p>"incoherent" and "unsuccessful". </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) She dwelled a bit on peace.  She told us her views </p><p>had not changed and that she remained committed to a </p><p>peaceful, negotiated outcome.  But any settlement must pay </p><p>due regard to democratic principles and human rights, she </p><p>asserted, and must be arrived at transparently.  "I am more </p><p>committed to peace than anyone in this country," she </p><p>proclaimed, but she has "no clue" what the government\'s plan </p><p>is.  She expressed her hope that someday the government would </p><p>"bring her, and the people of the country" into its </p><p>confidence.  She added a coda to her rif on peace:  she hoped </p><p>we had noticed that after "all six rounds" of the talks </p><p>between the GSL and the Tigers, Anton Balasingham had either </p><p>"threatened or vilified the head of the Sri Lankan state." </p><p>This, the head of the Sri Lankan state declared, was "rude </p><p>and intolerable" and might well be "at the behest of the UNP." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The q\'s and a\'s following her remarks were spicier. </p><p>The Egyptian Ambassador asked her if she intended to enter </p><p>into an alliance with the (hard left) JVP.  CBK replied that </p><p>"the peace process will not be hampered by arrangements that </p><p>might be arrived at with the JVP, which has moved away from </p><p>its anti-negotiations line."  She said her party and the JVP </p><p>"were still ironing out a few details" but gave us all the </p><p>impression the deal is nearly done.  "If we can negotiate </p><p>with the undemocratic LTTE, why not with the JVP?", she asked </p><p>rhetorically.  "The JVP has accepted that the economy will be </p><p>based on the free market . . .it has a strong belief in good </p><p>governance, democracy and equality . . ", the President </p><p>continued, "and is much more forthright and principled than </p><p>the UNP." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Swiss Ambassador asked for her views and those </p><p>of the JVP on federalism.  She ducked the latter part of his </p><p>question but announced that she personally favored federalism </p><p>as the correct model for Sri Lanka.  The Japanese Charge </p><p>asked her whether she supported the Tokyo Donors Conference </p><p>scheduled for June.  "Any donors conference is good for Sri </p><p>Lanka," the President declared, but she hoped donors would </p><p>focus as well on the importance of human rights, pluralism </p><p>and democratic governance country wide.  Finally, the </p><p>Pakistani HC asked for her assessment of whether the LTTE can </p><p>be transformed into a political organization.  CBK replied </p><p>that we should consult political scientists and psychiatrists </p><p>to guess the future of the LTTE . . . but in her view the </p><p>majority of Tiger cadre wanted peace and democracy while the </p><p>leaders\' opinions were completely unknown to her. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Afterwards, over tea, she approached me and </p><p>apologized for missing our scheduled appointment last week. </p><p>She had stayed in London for a few extra days to attend to </p><p>family business.  She said she would call me this week to fix </p><p>a new time for our private chat. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  I was a little concerned that the President </p><p>intended this meeting as a forum for her (extremely critical) </p><p>views regarding our resort to force against Saddam\'s regime, </p><p>but the subject did not come up.  I was glad it didn\'t </p><p>because I was seated directly across from the Iraqi Charge, </p><p>with whom I exchanged baleful glares a couple of times, and </p><p>quite near the Swedish CDA, who assaulted me last night at a </p><p>dinner party over our "immoral" policy in West Asia (the </p><p>Swede revealed herself to be thoroughly anti-American, and I </p><p>revealed to her certain anti-Swedish tendencies on my part). </p><p>I would have hated seeing the two of them gloat while I was </p><p>dressed down by the President. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) CBK was as charming as ever, even as she delivered </p><p>yet another indictment of the PM and his government.  Her </p><p>comments on the pending alliance with the JVP do not console </p><p>me or any other Western CoM (although perhaps the idiot </p><p>Swedish CDA is an exception).  Bringing the JVP into the </p><p>official opposition will benefit its radical agenda and hurt </p><p>the chances of peace and economic growth, the US\'s top two </p><p>interests in Sri Lanka.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
