(U) ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2002, USAID OFFICIALS ATTENDED AN </p><p>EMERGENCY-PREPAREDNESS MEETING CONVENED BY THE </p><p>CONSORTIUM OF HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES IN COLOMBO. THIS </p><p>RESULTED IN AN EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE </p><p>DROUGHT-LIKE CONDITIONS CONTINUING TO AFFECT THE </p><p>SOUTHERN DRY ZONE OF SRI LANKA. THE MEETING WAS CHAIRED </p><p>BY THE LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FEDERATION OF RED CROSS/CRESCENT SOCIETIES (IFRC); ALSO </p><p>ATTENDING WERE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED NATIONS, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL NGOS, AND THE NORWEGIAN AGENCY </p><p>FOR DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION (NORAD). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) A CONSENSUS WAS REACHED THAT ALTHOUGH RAINFALL IN </p><p>THE HAMBANTOTA AND MONERAGALA DISTRICTS CONTINUES TO BE BE </p><p>SCANT, CONSTRAINING DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES AND IRRIGATED </p><p>AGRICULTURE, THE SITUATION AT PRESENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE </p><p>AN EMERGENCY.  THIS IS UNDERSCORED BY THE ABSENCE TO DATE </p><p>OF A FORMAL REQUEST FOR RELIEF ASSISTANCE BY THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>OF SRI LANKA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) INDIVIDUAL MINISTERS WITH STRONG POLITICAL TIES </p><p>TO THE REGION HAVE HOWEVER APPEALED TO VARIOUS DONORS, </p><p>INCLUDING USAID, FOR FUNDING OF RELATED PROJECTS IN </p><p>DROUGHT-AFFECTED PARTS OF THEIR CONSTITUENCIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) USAID OFFICIALS CARRIED OUT A VISIT TO THE REGION </p><p>FROM AUGUST 11-14, 2002, TO CONDUCT A RISK-POTENTIAL </p><p>ASSESSMENT AND MONITOR THE EFFICACY OF DROUGHT RELIEF </p><p>ASSISTANCE MADE AVAILABLE IN 2001. SAVE THE CHILDREN </p><p>FUND (UK) (SCF/UK) RECEIVED A $25,000 DISASTER </p><p>ASSISTANCE GRANT PURSUANT TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S DISASTER </p><p>DECLARATION OF SEPTEMBER 6, 2001.  THE FUNDS WERE USED </p><p>TO PURCHASE WATER BOWSERS, STORAGE TANKS AND PORTABLE </p><p>CONTAINERS TO PROVIDE CLEAN DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES IN </p><p>HAMBANTOTA AND MONERAGALA. BASED ON FIRST-HAND </p><p>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS AND </p><p>RESIDENTS OF AFFECTED AREAS, USAID OFFICIALS CONCLUDED </p><p>THAT THE ASSISTANCE WAS BEING USED APPROPRIATELY TO </p><p>MITIGATE EFFECTS OF PERSISTENT DROUGHT-LIKE CONDITIONS </p><p>IN THE AREA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) USAID OFFICIALS ALSO CONCLUDED, HOWEVER, THAT LACK </p><p>OF RAINFALL HAS CONTINUED TO SEVERELY LIMIT ACCESS TO </p><p>POTABLE WATER FOR MANY LOCAL RESIDENTS AND LIKEWISE </p><p>CONSTRAINED THE WATER-INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE -- PRIMARILY </p><p>PADDY FARMING -- PREDOMINANT IN THE REGION. PERSISTENCE </p><p>OF DROUGHT-LIKE CONDITIONS IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER, </p><p>MONTHS DURING WHICH TYPICAL RAINFALL IS RELATIVELY HIGH, </p><p>WILL UNDOUBTEDLY EXACERBATE THESE PROBLEMS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) USAID/SRI LANKA CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE SITUATION </p><p>IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH NGO PARTNERS INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>AFFECTED REGION, UN AGENCIES AND OTHER DONORS.  THE </p><p>MISSION IS PREPARED TO DISPATCH A TEAM FOR ADDITIONAL </p><p>ASSESSMENT SHOULD EXPECTED RAINS FAIL LATER THIS MONTH. </p><p>WE MAY REQUEST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM OFDA\'S REGIONAL </p><p>DISASTER ADVISOR IN CONDUCTING THIS ASSESSMENT. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
