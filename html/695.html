<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SEOUL 009874 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, KS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTH KOREA:  1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY.  (U)  THE ROKG VIEWS ITSELF AS A POTENTIAL </p><p>TARGET FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND SHARES A STRONG </p><p>POLICY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM WITH THE UNITED </p><p>STATES.  THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC </p><p>TERORISM IN 1994, AND NO ROKG PROSECUTIONS OR EXTRADITIONS </p><p>INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THE POLICE IN KOREA </p><p>CONSIDER RECURRING INCIDENTS OF STUDENT VIOLENCE TO BE </p><p>CRIMINAL ACTS AND NOT TERRORIST EVENTS.  THERE HAS BEEN NO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ROKG ATTITUDES TOWARD INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM SINCE 1993.  THE ROKG HAS NOT TAKEN </p><p>STEPS TO REDUCE THE LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN KOREA, </p><p>AS STIPULATED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 748, ALTHOUGH THE TOTAL </p><p>NUMBER OF LIBYAN DIPLOMATS HAS GONE DOWN THROUGH </p><p>ATTRITION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ROK AS A TARGET OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE ROKG SHARES USG CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST THREAT, AND OUR POLICIES ON </p><p>TERRORISM AND TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS ARE GENERALLY IN </p><p>AGREEMENT.  AS RECENTLY AS 1987, THE ROK WAS THE VICTIM OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM SPONSORED BY NORTH KOREA, WHICH </p><p>RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 115 PASSENGERS ABOARD KAL FLIGHT </p><p>858.  THE SELF-CONFESSED SABOTEUR OF KAL FLIGHT 858 WAS </p><p>TRIED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH, BUT RECEIVED A PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>PARDON IN 1990 AFTER COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE ROK AND </p><p>IMPLICATING NORTH KOREA IN THE BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC </p><p>TERRORISM IN 1994, AND NO ROKG PROSECUTIONS OR </p><p>EXTRADITIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ROKG ATTITUDES TOWARD </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM SINCE 1993. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE POLICE IN KOREA CONSIDER RECURRING INCIDENTS </p><p>OF STUDENT VIOLENCE TO BE CRIMINAL ACTS AND NOT TERRORIST </p><p>EVENTS. THE ROKG RESPONDS TO OCCASIONAL DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>DIRECTED AT USG FACILITIES IN KOREA THAT PROVIDE </p><p>CONVENIENT TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENT PROTESTERS. </p><p>THE INFLUENCE OF THE RADICAL STUDENT MOVEMENT IN KOREA </p><p>CONTINUES TO DIMINISH IN KEEPING WITH DEMOCRATIZATION. </p><p>STUDENTS CONTINUED TO STAGE DEMONSTRATIONS DURING 1994, </p><p>USING FIREBOMBS, IN ONE INSTANCE, AGAINST KOREAN POLICE </p><p>STATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE ROK HAS SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL LINKS AND </p><p>CORDIAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH LIBYA AND IRAN AND </p><p>THEREFORE THE ROKG DOES NOT CONSIDER THESE COUNTRIES </p><p>LIKELY TO CONDUCT TERRORIST OPERATIONS IN SOUTH KOREA. </p><p>NETHERTHELESS, ROKG SECURITY AGENCIES CONTINUE TO BE ALERT </p><p>TO POSSIBLE TERRORIST THREATS TO U.S. EMBASSY PERSONNEL </p><p>AND INSTALLATIONS.  THE USG AND ROKG ROUTINELY SHARE </p><p>INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL TERRORIST THREATS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA SIMULTANEOUSLY JOINED THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS AS FULL MEMBERS IN OCTOBER 1991.  THE ROKG, </p><p>WHILE DECLARING SUPPORT FOR UN SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA, </p><p>HAS TAKEN NO STEPS TO REDUCE THE LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE ROK, AS STIPULATED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 748, </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE LIBYAN PRESENCE HAS GONE DOWN TO SEVEN </p><p>PERSONS FROM THE EIGHT WHO WERE HERE IN MAY 1992. </p><p> </p><p>A STRONG POLICY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) THE ROKG HAS A STRONG POLICY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM BORNE OF ITS CONCERN OVER NORTH KOREAN TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) THE ROKG HAS NOT AND DOES NOT SUPPORT STATE </p><p>TERRORISM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, </p><p>FINANCIAL OR OTHER SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p>THE ROKG HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTED COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LANEY </p><p></p></div>
