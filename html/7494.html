<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000697 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  LEGISLATIVE RESULTS AND REACTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons:  1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  The Independent National Electoral </p><p>Commission (INEC) has posted results from about 80 percent </p><p>of the Senate and House races around the country. </p><p>Registering over 50 percent of the vote nationwide, the </p><p>ruling PDP will retain its majority in both chambers unless </p><p>there is a radical reversal in the voting trends.  If this </p><p>election is a forecast of the April 19 Presidential and </p><p>gubernatorial contests, this weekend will affirm the power </p><p>of incumbency in Nigeria.  President Obasanjo and the </p><p>lion\'s share of Governors will be returned to office. </p><p>However, there is a wide variance between INEC\'s official </p><p>results and the expectations of many opposition parties, </p><p>particularly the ANPP and AD.  The dissonance is widespread </p><p>and opposition party leaders have been huddling to </p><p>determine next steps.  Accusations of vote tampering and </p><p>manipulating tabulations are growing and many seem </p><p>credible.  By reversing previously announced results in </p><p>some races, INEC has not helped matters and has only added </p><p>to the opposition\'s suspicions.  The political temperature </p><p>has increased significantly.  The April 19 election will be </p><p>tense and the specter of violence looms too near in many </p><p>places.  Press reports indicate that elections that did not </p><p>hold on April 12 took place variously on April 13, 14 or 15 </p><p>in areas of six states in the South-South and Southeast. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REPORTED RESULTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Nigeria\'s Independent National Electoral Commission </p><p>(INEC) is reporting results in about 80 percent of the </p><p>Senate and House districts around the country.  The ruling </p><p>PDP is almost assured of retaining its majority on both </p><p>sides of the National Assembly with 170 seats in the House </p><p>going to the PDP.  (The PDP needs 181 seats for a </p><p>majority.)  The ANPP has improved its representation, </p><p>winning 80 seats thus far.  The AD is winning 30 seats and </p><p>other parties gaining representation include UNPP (two </p><p>seats), NDP (two), PRP (one), and AGPA (one).  In the </p><p>Senate, the PDP has won 60 of the 109 seats.  The ANPP has </p><p>25 seats and the AD has won just 5 seats.  No other parties </p><p>have yet been awarded a Senate seat.  Unless reporting </p><p>trends reverse significantly, PDP likely will be announced </p><p>as the winner of at least 15 of the remaining 19 seats in </p><p>the upper house, a significant increase in its existing </p><p>majority (68/109). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Press reports indicate that elections that could </p><p>not hold on April 12 took place variously on April 13, 14 </p><p>or 15 in areas of six states in the South-South and </p><p>Southeast -- Bayelsa, Delta, Rivers, Anambra, Akwa Ibom and </p><p>Cross River. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HARBINGER </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The "bandwagon effect" is said to be the </p><p>irresistible force in Nigerian electoral politics. </p><p>Consequently, many Nigerians see these results as a preview </p><p>of the gubernatorial and Presidential elections scheduled </p><p>for April 19.  If the legislative returns are indicative of </p><p>this Saturday\'s likely outcome, the PDP could be expected </p><p>to maintain its current 21 gubernatorial seats and perhaps </p><p>capture a few state capitals in the Southwest.  The results </p><p>from April 12 would indicate that the incumbent PDP </p><p>President Obasanjo could expect to win at least 55 percent </p><p>of the popular vote.  The ANPP would not exceed 30 percent </p><p>of the national vote, with little hope of gaining much </p><p>ground by teaming with any of the other opposition parties, </p><p>except for the AD (which is more likely to stand aloof than </p><p>to join forces with Buhari).  Making Buhari\'s position even </p><p>bleaker, the ANPP would be unable to meet the </p><p>constitutional requirement for a presidential victor to win </p><p>25 percent of the vote in two-thirds (25) of the 37 state </p><p>jurisdictions (36 states plus the Federal Capital </p><p>Territory).  Thus far, the ANPP is polling less than 25 </p><p>percent in 18 states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CRITICISM MOUNTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  For many races, INEC\'s returns diverge from the </p><p>expectations of many observers and activists in all the </p><p>parties.  The magnitude of the PDP "landslide" has </p><p>surprised security elements of the government, as well.  A </p><p>senior State Security Service official told PolOff that his </p><p>organization was "studying the results," with concern </p><p>mounting for maintaining public order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  General Muhammadu Buhari, the ANPP Presidential </p><p>candidate, denounced the election results, calling them a </p><p>"coup against democracy."  Castigating the results as </p><p>"spurious," Buhari said "the rigging and fraud that </p><p>attended the collation of the results of the just concluded </p><p>election is so blatant that 1983 now looks like some child\'s </p><p>play."  (NOTE:  Buhari knows about coups against a troubled </p><p>democracy.  He took power in a late-1983 coup that ousted an </p><p>unpopular civilian regime widely viewed as corrupt and </p><p>ineffective after it manipulated a "landslide" victory in </p><p>elections earlier that year.  Buhari\'s allusion to 1983 is </p><p>viewed as ominous by some and by others as ironic.  END </p><p>NOTE.)  Another Presidential candidate, Gani Fawehinmi, </p><p>described the parliamentary election as a "rigging spree." </p><p>Making the same allusion as Buhari, he said, "the same </p><p>scenario as in 1983 is playing out."  ANPP Chairman Don </p><p>Etiebet issued a statement on behalf of 12 of the 14 </p><p>political parties participating in these elections (all </p><p>except NCP and PDP) on April 15 rejecting the results. </p><p>While the parties identified many alleged irregularities, </p><p>Etiebet stressed that the parties would not boycott the </p><p>Presidential and gubernatorial elections.  Buhari echoed </p><p>this in a broadcast on BBC Hausa service.  He reiterated his </p><p>warning to be vigilant for fraud, pointing out that he had </p><p>issued the same advice at almost every campaign stop in the </p><p>past few months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FUNNY BUSINESS (POLITICAL STYLE) </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The INEC results surprised many people and, in </p><p>many instances, are seen to diverge with preliminary </p><p>indications based on field observations of party agents, </p><p>domestic and international monitors and Mission officers. </p><p>Internal discrepancies are found throughout the results </p><p>announced thus far by INEC.  Perhaps the most stunning </p><p>development is the overwhelming PDP victory in the </p><p>Southwest region.  The PDP basically dominated the results </p><p>in a region up to then in the firm grasp of the AD.  While </p><p>the PDP was expected to make some inroads, according to </p><p>both AD and PDP partisans, the margin of PDP victory was </p><p>vast.  One PDP campaigner told PolOff that his expectation, </p><p>based on consultation with his AD counterparts immediately </p><p>after the close of the polls, was that the PDP would pick </p><p>up about six Senate seats and between 8 and 12 House seats. </p><p>"When I woke on Sunday, I was embarrassed and unable to </p><p>explain the turnaround," he said.  A similar assessment was </p><p>provided by an AD campaigner, who thought the PDP would </p><p>gain six Senate and between 6 and ten House seats in the </p><p>Southwest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The reported 90 percent voters turnout in Rivers </p><p>State (South-South) is also being heavily questioned. </p><p>MissionOffs reported a light turnout in Rivers, ranging </p><p>from 15 to 30 percent of the registered voters. </p><p>MissionOffs also encountered strong support for the ANPP in </p><p>many areas.  However, INEC results show that the PDP won </p><p>roughly 90 percent of this very high turn-out, making for </p><p>an embarrassing rout of the ANPP.  Reported turnout or </p><p>results in Edo State (South-South) and Katsina State </p><p>(Northwest) are also at odds with Emboffs firsthand, albeit </p><p>incomplete, observations.  Agents from both PDP and </p><p>opposition parties highlight results from many other </p><p>locations, including Adamawa, Bauchi and Kaduna States in </p><p>the North and Imo, Enugu and Anambra States in the </p><p>Southeast that did not jibe with their unofficial tallies. </p><p>Other critics comment that awarding some races to one party </p><p>on Sunday and reversing the decision on Monday raises </p><p>questions of the accuracy and efficiency of INEC\'s </p><p>collation efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  COMMENT:  The April 12 results thus far show the </p><p>PDP to be the big and only real winner.  The ANPP did well </p><p>only in the North and did not gain the ground in the South- </p><p>South and Southeast that they had expected.  The AD was </p><p>rousted from its own house and may have been dealt a mortal </p><p>blow.  The other opposition parties\' vote totals were </p><p>little more than crumbs.  In effect, the National Assembly </p><p>vote, if repeated on April 19, would make the PDP the only </p><p>national party, rendering the ANPP a northern party, </p><p>wrecking the AD and marking the other parties as entirely </p><p>inconsequential.  Thus, the cries of foul and cheating must </p><p>be seen from this perspective; the opposition parties are </p><p>fighting for sheer survival.  However, more is at play. </p><p>The allegations of fraud and tampering are multiplying and </p><p>many cannot be dismissed.  Many of these allegations are </p><p>credible and jibe with our own observations.  While our </p><p>observations were more spot-checking than rigorous </p><p>monitoring, it would defy statistical probability to </p><p>suggest that the voting and tabulation trends we observed </p><p>in our sampling in, for example, Rivers and Katsina had </p><p>virtually no external validity.  The opposition parties </p><p>have grounds to be upset and their "rejection" of the </p><p>results was a predictable reaction.  However, they have </p><p>decided not to boycott but to work together to observe more </p><p>stringently the vote tabulation process.  Thus, the April </p><p>19 election will be conducted in an atmosphere of palpable </p><p>suspicion and distrust.  It will make for an uneasy </p><p>Saturday and a tension-filled Easter.  INEC faces its </p><p>biggest trial yet. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
