<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000677 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, KCRM, PTER, YM, TERFIN, ECON/COM </p><p>SUBJECT: ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAW SIGNED, ENFORCEMENT </p><p>QUESTIONED </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by CDA Alan G. Misenheimer for reasons 1.5 b. </p><p> and d. </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: President Saleh signed the ROYG\'s anti-money </p><p>laundering legislation into law on April 5. The law was </p><p>written in consultation with the World Bank. While not </p><p>specifically mentioning terrorism, the law criminalizes money </p><p>laundering for the first time and requires banks to verify </p><p>names of their account holders.  One local banking official </p><p>credits the law as a solid first step, but has strong </p><p>concerns about the Central Bank\'s ability to enforce it. The </p><p>Central Bank has recently intervened to shore up the sagging </p><p>riyal. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Anti-Money Laundering Law Passed </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> 2. (U) The official newspaper al-Thawra ran a front page </p><p>story announcing that President Saleh signed Law 35 of 2003, </p><p>the Anti-Money Laundering Law, on April 5.  The new law </p><p>requires banks to verify the names and documents of account </p><p>holders and criminalizes money laundering. To coordinate </p><p>enforcement and unify reporting procedures, the law </p><p>establishes a committee composed of members of the banking </p><p>community and representatives from the Ministries of Foreign </p><p>Affairs and Finance under the oversight of the Central Bank. </p><p>The law also encourages international cooperation, </p><p>facilitates information exchange with other nations, and </p><p>includes provisions allowing the extradition of non-Yemenis </p><p>convicted under the law. (Note: Yemeni law does not allow for </p><p>the extradition of Yemeni citizens.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) According to press reports, the law defines money </p><p>laundering as the illegitimate hiding of revenue generated </p><p>from such crimes as kidnapping, drug smuggling, and illegal </p><p>arms trade. The law does not specifically mention terrorism, </p><p>but many of the acts associated with the funding of terrorism </p><p>would be covered by this law. Those convicted of money </p><p>laundering could face up to five years in prison and </p><p>confiscation of any assets used illegally.  Ibrahim </p><p>Al-Nahari, Director of External Relations at the Ministry of </p><p>Finance, who had flown to Washington last December to discuss </p><p>provisions of the law with the World Bank, told Pol/Econoff </p><p>that all of the Bank\'s suggestions were incorporated into the </p><p>law. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Enforcement </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Regional Manager of the Arab Bank in Yemen, Mahdi </p><p>Alawi (please protect), called the new money laundering law a </p><p>good step forward in the evolution of banking in Yemen. </p><p>Noting that the Arab Bank already follows many of the </p><p>provisions under the law because it makes good business </p><p>sense, he said this law will force domestic banks in Yemen to </p><p>know their customers -- a practice, he said, that is not </p><p>common in Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Government ministries and organizations are mandated </p><p>by law to use the Yemen Central Bank for accounting and money </p><p>disbursal.  According to Alawi, former Prime Minister Abdul </p><p>Karim Al-Iryani guided this restriction into law, hoping that </p><p>the government would have more control over transactions. </p><p>However, Alawi said, the exact opposite has happened, and </p><p>there is less control over the way the Ministries spend their </p><p>funds because the Central Bank is unable to investigate </p><p>discrepancies and has no financial intelligence operation to </p><p>review unjust accounting practices. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Transparency Laws Still Needed </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) An even greater problem, according to Alawi, is that </p><p>Ministers and other high-ranking officials are allowed to </p><p>have personal accounts in banks and are not required to </p><p>report their financial holdings to the government or the </p><p>public. (Comment: This problem will likely persist because </p><p>the anti-money laundering law has no provision for financial </p><p>reporting by government officials. End Comment.)  Alawi said </p><p>that the corruption in Yemen involves small amounts of money, </p><p>and that Yemen compared favorably to what he saw in Nigeria. </p><p>However, he cautioned, in the banking industry, misuse of </p><p>small funds is even harder to discover and report to </p><p>regulatory officials. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Central Bank\'s Fiscal Policy is Sound </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Alawi praised the Central Bank\'s tight control of </p><p>fiscal policy, noting positively that the recent injection of </p><p>approximately fifty million USD to keep the riyal strong </p><p>against selling related to fears the Yemeni economy would be </p><p>hurt as the war in Iraq began.  However, he noted that the </p><p>Central Bank was walking a fine line between keeping the </p><p>currency stable and market pressures that are pushing the </p><p>riyal down. Alawi expects that the riyal will drop slightly </p><p>in the coming year because most experts, including the </p><p>Economist Intelligence Unit, expect economic growth to slow </p><p>because of an expected drop in the price of oil. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: The Anti-Money Laundering law is a </p><p>significant step forward for the Republic of Yemen.  However, </p><p>enforcement issues will be the true test of Yemeni commitment </p><p>to having a well-regulated banking industry. Colleagues in </p><p>the banking industry and at the World Bank have praised the </p><p>Central Bank for its tight control of fiscal policy.  The </p><p>next question is if they will be given the means and </p><p>authority to enforce the new law. Yemen has a pattern of </p><p>passing laws that are generally praised by the international </p><p>community, but falls short on enforcement. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
