REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>JUDICIAL RULING </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) IN A SIGNIFICANT LEGAL VICTORY FOR THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), HIGH COURT JUDGE JAMES DEVITTIE ON </p><p>APRIL 26 NULLIFIED ZANU-PF\'S PARLIAMENTARY VICTORIES IN TWO </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES LAST JUNE -- BUHERA NORTH IN MANICALAND AND HURUNGWE </p><p>EAST IN MASHONALAND WEST -- AND DECLARED THE TWO SEATS VACANT.  THE </p><p>PETITIONER IN THE BUHERA NORTH CASE IS MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI, WHO HAD LOST TO THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE -- KENNETH </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MANYONDA -- BY 2500 VOTES (OUT OF A TOTAL OF MORE THAN 23,000 </p><p>BALLOTS CAST).  IN HIS ORAL REMARKS, DEVITTIE CITED WIDESPREAD </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION IN THE TWO VOTING DISTRICTS, NOTING THAT </p><p>THE CLIMATE MAY HAVE PREVENTED CITIZENS FROM "EXERCISING THEIR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC RIGHT TO VOTE."  REFLECTING THE INTENSE PRESSURE </p><p>CONFRONTING HIM AND HIS TWO HIGH COURT COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HANDLING </p><p>THE MDC\'S LEGAL CHALLENGES, DEVITTIE SAID HIS DECISIONS CAUSED HIM </p><p>"MORE ANXIETY THAN HE HAS HAD CAUSE TO FEEL IN THE TIME HE HAS SAT </p><p>ON THE BENCH." </p><p> </p><p>REACTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) TSVANGIRAI WELCOMED THE JUDGMENT, SAYING IT HAD CONFIRMED </p><p>THAT LAST JUNE\'S ELECTIONS HAD NOT BEEN FREE AND FAIR, AND HE </p><p>PRAISED THE JUDICIARY FOR NOT SUCCUMBING TO STATE INTIMIDATION.  IN </p><p>A SURPRISINGLY UPBEAT REACTION, THE USUALLY VITRIOLIC MINISTER OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01453  271152Z </p><p>INFORMATION JONATHAN MOYO EMPHASIZED THE GOVERNMENT\'S COMMITMENT TO </p><p>THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR COURT DECISIONS.  AN ALMOST GIDDY </p><p>MOYO SAID ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS WERE "RARING" TO CONTEST A BY-ELECTION </p><p>AND SAID HE HOPED THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL WOULD ORGANIZE THE PROCESS </p><p>WITHOUT DELAY. </p><p> </p><p>NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO THE ELECTORAL ACT, BY-ELECTIONS MUST BE HELD </p><p>TO FILL THE NOW VACANT SEATS WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 90 DAYS FROM THE </p><p>DATE DEVITTIE\'S WRITTEN JUDGMENT IS RELEASED -- EXPECTED WITHIN A </p><p>WEEK -- OR OF A SUPREME COURT RULING UPHOLDING HIS DECISION.  GANDI </p><p>MUDZINGWA, TSVANGIRAI\'S PERSONAL ASSISTANT, TOLD POLITICAL SECTION </p><p>CHIEF ON APRIL 27 THAT THE MDC PRESIDENT WAS TORN ABOUT WHETHER TO </p><p>CONTEST THE BY-ELECTION.  ON ONE HAND, HE WANTS TO DEMONSTRATE TO </p><p>THE VOTERS IN BUHERA NORTH THAT HE IS NOT AFRAID TO RUN AGAIN BUT, </p><p>ON THE OTHER, CONTESTING A PARLIAMENTARY SEAT WHILE HE IS RUNNING </p><p>FOR PRESIDENT MIGHT NOT MAKE THE BEST SENSE.  MUDZINGWA SAID THE </p><p>MDC\'S NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WOULD MEET SOON TO CONSIDER THIS </p><p>ISSUE.  DEVITTIE IS SCHEDULED TO RENDER DECISIONS IN TWO OTHER </p><p>CASES THE AFTERNOON OF APRIL 27. </p><p> </p><p>MORE INTIMIDATION </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) TWO HOURS AFTER DEVITTIE ANNOUNCED HIS RULINGS ON APRIL 26, </p><p>A GROUP OF FIFTEEN CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION AGENTS AND </p><p>POLICE IN RIOT GEAR APPEARED AT THE MDC\'S HEADQUARTERS IN DOWNTOWN </p><p>HARARE.  THEY ARRESTED FOUR OF TSVANGIRAI\'S BODYGUARDS, ACCUSING </p><p>THEM OF HAVING RECEIVED MILITARY TRAINING IN UGANDA.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01453  271152Z </p><p>MUDZINGWA, THE FOUR WERE DETAINED OVERNIGHT AT HARARE\'S CENTRAL </p><p>POLICE STATION AND DENIED ACCESS TO THEIR ATTORNEY.  AS OF MIDDAY </p><p>ON APRIL 27, FORMAL CHARGES STILL HAD NOT BEEN FILED AGAINST THE </p><p>FOUR, WHO REMAINED IN DETENTION AND CONTINUED TO BE DENIED ACCESS </p><p>TO LEGAL COUNSEL. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) DEVITTIE SHOWED A GREAT DEAL OF COURAGE, AS HE WAS UNDER </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE TO RULE THE OTHER WAY.  INDEED, HIS DECISIONS </p><p>TOOK EVERYONE IN THE COURTROOM BY SURPRISE, AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY </p><p>GIVE HOPE TO ZIMBABWEANS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN FEELING </p><p>INCREASINGLY DESPONDENT ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF THEIR COUNTRY. </p><p>MOYO\'S POSITIVE REACTION PROVIDES REASON TO BE SUSPICIOUS, AND </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT ZANU-PF HAS SOME OTHER PLAN UP ITS SLEEVE THAT </p><p>PROBABLY WILL INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION.  THE GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY REVEALED ITS TRUE COLORS IN </p><p>RAIDING THE MDC\'S OFFICES SO SOON AFTER DEVITTIE\'S JUDGMENTS. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE ELECTORAL ACT PROVIDES GENERAL TIMELINES WITHIN WHICH </p><p>A BY-ELECTION SHOULD BE HELD, IT PROVIDES THE PRESIDENT WITH SOME </p><p>DISCRETION FOR DELAY, AND WE FULLY EXPECT MUGABE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE </p><p>OF THIS WIGGLE ROOM. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
