<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 005464 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND EB/ESC </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/MAC/AME </p><p>USDOC FOR 3131/USFCS/OIO/ANESA </p><p>USDOE FOR IE - C.WASHINGTON AND L.COBURN </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/21/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, EINV, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT: SENIOR ADVISOR ON STATUS OF PROJECT KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KUWAIT 5415 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KUWAIT 5109 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) On 21 December, EconChief met with Khalid Yousef Fulaij </p><p>(strictly protect), who serves as an Advisor on Petroleum </p><p>Affairs in the Office of the Chairman of Kuwait\'s Supreme </p><p>Petroleum Council (SPC). The current chairman of the SPC is </p><p>Foreign Minister and de facto Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah </p><p>Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.  EconChief asked about the status </p><p>of Project Kuwait for the development of the country\'s </p><p>northern oil fields (reftel B). </p><p> </p><p>2.(C)  Fulaij explained that since the Spring of 2002, SPC </p><p>action on the project had been delayed for many reasons, </p><p>citing specifically the parliamentary \'grilling\' of the </p><p>Minister of Finance, summer holidays, and the selection of a </p><p>few new members for the SPC in July.  However, he said, since </p><p>September the SPC\'s technical subcommittee on the project has </p><p>been meeting weekly to review the project and its terms. </p><p>Fulaij reported that review of the financial terms for the </p><p>project was now complete, and that the draft contractual </p><p>arrangements were now the focus. He predicted that this </p><p>review should be completed sometime in the month of January. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Fulaij said that once the SPC technical subcommittee </p><p>had finalized its work, the approval of the full SPC was a </p><p>simple procedure (noting that the technical committee </p><p>comprised seven of the fourteen members of the full SPC). </p><p>Once the full SPC had approved the drafts, the drafts would </p><p>be shared with the international oil companies (IOCs) that </p><p>were pursuing the project.  This effort would not, however, </p><p>be intended to solicit formal proposals or bids from the </p><p>companies, but rather as a step to ensure companies remained </p><p>interested in and committed to the project.  Fulaij explained </p><p>that firms would be asked to comment on the terms and </p><p>conditions, but he did not specify what would be done with </p><p>the responses (presumably they would be used to refine the </p><p>terms and conditions of the deal). </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) Fulaij commented that he did not believe the Government </p><p>would work with the current National Assembly to secure </p><p>passage of the implementing legislation for Project Kuwait, </p><p>saying that the current legislative calendar is already too </p><p>full.  Indeed, he said that Sheikh Sabah was asking whether </p><p>implementing legislation was even needed, since IOCs would </p><p>never take title to the oil.  He compared the IOC role to </p><p>that of oilfield service companies, whose contracts are not </p><p>ratified by the National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) When EconChief stressed the importance of prompt </p><p>action, Fulaij said he understood the impatience of IOCs.  He </p><p>noted that Sheikh Sabah was also impatient, and regularly </p><p>asked about the status of the project. </p><p> </p><p>6.(C) Comment:  Post is not sure how to square Fualij\'s </p><p>comment that action with this National Assembly is not </p><p>forthcoming and the acting Oil Minister\'s assertion (reftel </p><p>A) that Project Kuwait would be approved before his term as </p><p>Minister ended.  The suggestion that parliamentary approval </p><p>will not be sought is one possible explanation, but with </p><p>relations already so poor between the Government and the </p><p>National Assembly, we believe this move would only poison the </p><p>relationship further.  Boiling it all down, we believe the </p><p>government remains fully committed to the project, but is so </p><p>flustered with other pressing matters and with the obstinacy </p><p>of the National Assembly that it can\'t find a way to make the </p><p>project a priority.  End Comment. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
