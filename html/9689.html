<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001890 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, MNUC, NL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: CONTAINER SECURITY INITIATIVE: PROPOSED </p><p>RADIOLOGICAL PORTAL AGREEMENT CATAPULTED INTO PUBLIC </p><p>ATTENTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: State 213786 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Finance Minister Zalm\'s "agreement" with U.S. </p><p>authorities regarding installation of radiological detectors </p><p>in the port of Rotterdam received prominent attention in the </p><p>afternoon (7/24) and morning (7/25) Dutch media.  According </p><p>to the press, Zalm expects he can soon launch the new </p><p>security measures but has first to discuss the matter with </p><p>shipping companies that utilize the Rotterdam port. </p><p>Ministry of Finance press spokesmen are directly quoted in </p><p>defense of the initiative noting that that the detection </p><p>devices can " prevent the smuggling to the U.S. of material, </p><p>which may be used for the production of nuclear weapons and </p><p>that  "shipping will hardly be delayed."  In response to one </p><p>newspaper\'s report that the Netherlands will bear the costs </p><p>of the equipment, Zalm\'s spokesman emphasized that, usually, </p><p>"the minister does nothing for free" implying that the Dutch </p><p>may in return ask for U.S. support on other issues.  The </p><p>press also carried comments from a spokesman for EU </p><p>Commissioner Bolkestein suggesting that the matter is more </p><p>properly handled in a U.S.-EU context under the umbrella of </p><p>the European-American Customs Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>2. Comment:  Officials from the Ministry of Finance and </p><p>other government agencies we contacted today had been caught </p><p>by surprise by the breaking of this story.  They have not </p><p>yet been given instructions regarding conclusion and </p><p>implementation of final agreement on the portals and were </p><p>unwilling to speculate on a possible timetable.  Dutch </p><p>officials had previously indicated their preference for a </p><p>low-key approach in order to minimize the possibility of </p><p>conflict with the European Commission over competence. </p><p> </p><p>Russel </p><p></p></div>
