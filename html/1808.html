<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001622 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR: DS/DSS, DS/OP/AF AND AF/EX </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ROBBERY OF LOCAL RESIDENCE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY </p><p>EMBASSY HOUSING COMPOUNDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On Sunday, July 8, 2001 at approximately 2000 </p><p>hours a local residence belonging to a private Nigerian </p><p>citizen was the victim of a home invasion type robbery. </p><p>The residence is located adjacent (across a street) from </p><p>one 2-unit Embassy housing compound, and two doors down the </p><p>street from another 3-unit Embassy housing compound. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The owner of the residence arrived home to find </p><p>personal belongings scattered on the floor throughout the </p><p>residence.  Further search of the compound by the owner </p><p>uncovered two acquaintances and a security guard had been </p><p>locked up in the domestic quarters located at the rear of </p><p>the compound. The two acquaintances and security guard </p><p>reported a group of five male individuals armed with four </p><p>locally made pistols had forced their way into the compound </p><p>while the gate was opened to allow a vehicle out.  The </p><p>robbers forced all persons in the residence into the </p><p>domestic quarters, locking them in one of the rooms. </p><p>During the course of the robbery, the robbers severed the </p><p>residence  telephone lines.  The robbers stole electronic </p><p>items, jewelry and money (NFI), before fleeing the </p><p>compound. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The local guards posted at the adjacent Embassy </p><p>residential compound, reported the robbers headed across </p><p>the street towards their location.  The Embassy guards, </p><p>aware of the incident, had already secured their gate and </p><p>radioed the Local Guard Force Mobile Patrol vehicle for </p><p>assistance.  Upon seeing the Embassy  local guard force </p><p>mobile patrol vehicle arriving on scene, the robbers </p><p>changed direction and fled into the nearby bush </p><p>(undeveloped land). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Local police sources advise they have apprehended </p><p>the robbers based on information provided to them by a </p><p>confidential source at the robbers\' residence outside of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>town.  Police investigation revealed the robbers\' get-away </p><p>vehicle was parked on a 4-lane divided highway located a </p><p>short distance from the residences through the bush. The </p><p>police apprehended a gang of nine robbers, who have a </p><p>history of committing violent home invasion robberies and </p><p>car-jackings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The RSO commended the Embassy  local guard force </p><p>for a job well done, their keen observation and quick </p><p>action surely prevented an Embassy residential compound </p><p>from being targeted by the robbers.  All members of the </p><p>Embassy  local guard force were reminded of the importance </p><p>of being vigilant while on duty, and instructed regarding </p><p>the proper procedures for addressing a criminal threat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Direct any questions regarding this matter to </p><p>Michael E. Bishop, RSO, U.S. Embassy Abuja, Nigeria at 234- </p><p>9-523-0960. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
