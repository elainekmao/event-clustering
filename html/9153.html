According to CPV and GVN authorities in </p><p>Hanoi and the Northwest Highlands, new CPV resolutions on </p><p>ethnic minorities and religion do little more than reiterate </p><p>long-standing policies, while nonetheless trying to elevate </p><p>attention to these issues and the need for better </p><p>implementation.  On the ground, nothing seems to have </p><p>changed.  Officials have refuted allegations of forced </p><p>renunciations of faith, while confirming that evangelism is </p><p>essentially illegal.  Despite more conciliatory comments </p><p>from the new Chairman of Government Committee on Religious </p><p>Affairs, most CPV officials seem to view religion as an </p><p>inherited quality, like ethnicity, which makes them </p><p>reluctant to accept the possibility of conversions.  Their </p><p>own underground history likely also makes them unusually </p><p>sensitive to "threats" from evangelism and "illegal" </p><p>gatherings in Vietnam\'s mountainous areas.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The second session of the seventh plenum of the </p><p>Communist Party of Vietnam\'s 9th Central Committee in </p><p>January adopted new, sweeping resolutions of CPV policy </p><p>regarding work on religious affairs, work with ethnic </p><p>minorities, and land use (ref B).  Ref C provides full text </p><p>of the religious affairs resolution. </p><p> </p><p>The Hanoi view </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In a meeting with Pol/C on June 30, Dr. Nguyen Duc </p><p>Lu, Director of the Ho Chi Minh National Political Academy\'s </p><p>Center for "Science of Belief and Religion," explained the </p><p>passage of the resolutions on religion and minorities in </p><p>particular as a clear symbol of the importance the CPV </p><p>places on handling these issues well.  (Note:  As reported </p><p>in ref D, this Center not only trains CPV and GVN cadres on </p><p>religious policy, but also provides recommendations on </p><p>policy and regulations related to religion.  End note)  He </p><p>emphasized that these resolutions did not/not indicate a </p><p>shift in CPV policy.  However, he noted that previous CPV </p><p>policy on religion had been issued by the Politburo; the </p><p>decision to have the full Central Committee consider and </p><p>approve this resolution demonstrated the broad scope and </p><p>support for the CPV policy.  He added that the Central </p><p>Committee resolutions, and expected subsequent study </p><p>sessions at all levels of the CPV, would "popularize" and </p><p>"unify" the "positive" views of the CPV toward ethnic and </p><p>religious affairs and "encourage greater understanding." </p><p>Dr. Lu reiterated that the CPV view is that "religion has a </p><p>good role in promoting humanitarianism, good conduct, and </p><p>culture." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Dr. Lu nonetheless cited concerns within the CPV </p><p>about the "threat" from "hostile forces" who use illegal </p><p>religious activities or illegal religions to undermine the </p><p>State -- key themes of the resolution on religion.  He </p><p>claimed, however, that such concerns did not stem from </p><p>specific recent incidents, much less the 2001 demonstrations </p><p>in the Central Highlands.  When pressed, he also admitted </p><p>that "hostile forces" -- while being "hard to define" -- </p><p>referred to individuals and organizations based overseas, </p><p>and not/not to any programs or policies of the USG. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Dr. Lu noted some "confusion" about what -- exactly </p><p>-- constitutes "legal" and "illegal" religious activities, </p><p>and said his staff is currently conducting research on this </p><p>issue.  The CPV and GVN are still drafting regulations </p><p>covering religious activities that will spell this out in </p><p>greater specificity, but much remains unresolved.  He has </p><p>already participated in two conferences on these </p><p>regulations; he admitted a "lack of unanimity."  He declined </p><p>to predict when the regulations would be passed, but </p><p>indicated that the goal was in the next year or two.  Still </p><p>further ahead would be an even more definitive national law </p><p>on religion, which the National Assembly would pass.  He </p><p>expressed frank incredulity that the USG did not regulate </p><p>the tenets of faith of religious denominations and "cults," </p><p>noting the possibility of cults teaching "immoral </p><p>practices."  Pol/C explained the US Constitutional </p><p>separation of Church and State, and official respect for the </p><p>personal nature of faith. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  When Pol/C described continuing reports from Lai </p><p>Chau, Lao Cai, and elsewhere of attempts at forced </p><p>renunciations of faith, primarily among ethnic minority </p><p>Protestants (ref a), Dr. Lu emphasized that any such efforts </p><p>would indeed be illegal and that no one had the right either </p><p>to force someone to believe or not to believe.  He implied </p><p>that such reports might be fabricated by outside agitators. </p><p>He added that Vietnamese remember how the French authorities </p><p>had used the "pretext" of protecting Catholics in order to </p><p>colonialize Vietnam, and implied that the CPV had to be </p><p>vigilant to ensure that the "hostile forces" had no similar </p><p>plans using a Protestant excuse. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Dr. Lu was vague when asked about the legality of </p><p>evangelism and proselytism.  He initially indicated that </p><p>Vietnamese have the right to spread their faith, but then </p><p>added that, in principle, people who do so should be </p><p>graduates from a recognized religious training center. </p><p>(Note: The Protestant Seminary in Hanoi has been closed for </p><p>a decade, and the seminary affiliated with the Southern </p><p>Evangelical Church of Vietnam only opened in 2003.  End </p><p>note) </p><p> </p><p>On the ground </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  To determine provincial implementation of and </p><p>attention to these resolutions and to investigate claims of </p><p>harassment of ethnic minorities, Pol/C and Pol FSN visited </p><p>Lai Chau and Son La provinces during the week of June 23. </p><p>Both have only a minority of Kinh residents, with ethnic </p><p>Thais predominant in each.  Each has significant Hmong </p><p>populations and borders with Laos.  Lai Chau also has a </p><p>border with China.  Both are among the poorest provinces in </p><p>the country in terms of per capita income. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Provincial authorities in both Lai Chau and Son Lao </p><p>flatly asserted that there were no religious believers of </p><p>any kind living in these provinces.  Not only are there no </p><p>Catholic churches or Protestant worship centers, there are </p><p>not even any Buddhist temples, they claimed, citing the </p><p>remote locations and different cultural traditions of the </p><p>ethnic minorities.  They admitted that that many, perhaps </p><p>most, families (Kinh and minorities alike) engage in some </p><p>traditional ancestor worship.  At the same time, they </p><p>stressed that all citizens have the freedom to believe or </p><p>not to believe, as "guaranteed" in the Constitution.  Lai </p><p>Chau officials admitted that there had been some efforts at </p><p>evangelism by Hmong Protestants, noting that such such </p><p>activities were "not according to the law" (while not </p><p>explicitly labeling them "illegal.")  They declined to </p><p>comment on whether anyone had been arrested or punished for </p><p>having engaged in evangelism. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  In the absence of worship centers, Son La </p><p>officials escorted Pol/C to visit a shrine to a 15th century </p><p>Vietnamese king who once visited this scenic spot.  Despite </p><p>official prohibitions on "superstitious activities," the </p><p>shrine was full of recent high school graduates lighting </p><p>incense to pray for good luck on the July 4 nationwide </p><p>university examinations.  The Ministry of Culture and </p><p>Information has just devoted 4 billion VND (USD 267,000) to </p><p>construct a temple-like building adjacent to the cave in </p><p>which the shrine has long existed. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Officials in both provinces firmly denied the </p><p>possibility of the reports Pol/C cited about harassment and </p><p>forced renunciation of faith.  They claimed such incidents </p><p>were "impossible" given the non-existence of religious </p><p>believers.  They insisted that there were no official </p><p>programs to convince people either not to believe in </p><p>religion or to renounce religious belief.  They declined to </p><p>comment on whether any official discovered to have attempted </p><p>forced renunciation of faith could be punished </p><p>administratively or under the law.  Lai Chau officials also </p><p>flatly denied reports of a December 2002 gassing episode in </p><p>Hoi Huong hamlet, although another provincial official had </p><p>at the time confirmed a barebones version of this incident </p><p>by phone to Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  The passage of the seventh plenum resolutions on </p><p>minorities and religion indicated the "full importance" the </p><p>CPV and GVN places on proper work in these fields, officials </p><p>noted, while insisting that there was no change in Vietnam\'s </p><p>"consistent" policies.  They emphasized that there were no </p><p>new programs, initiatives, or training efforts following up </p><p>on these resolutions, and claimed that there had not even </p><p>been any special classes or meetings to discuss the contents </p><p>of these resolutions.  When pressed (with Pol/C reading from </p><p>a VNA account of instructions given to the Ethnic Minorities </p><p>Commission Chairman at the May 2003 Cabinet meeting), Lai </p><p>Chau officials admitted that a delegation from Commission </p><p>had visited the province in early June to "seek opinions" on </p><p>how better to handle minority affairs.  Officials said that </p><p>their bottom line response was "give us more resources." </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  Officials uniformly stressed that the most </p><p>important way to help ethnic minorities was to promote </p><p>overall economic development, as well as related programs </p><p>against hunger and illiteracy, in order to "guarantee </p><p>equality and solidarity."  Infrastructural investment under </p><p>Program 135 was an important aspect of these efforts, </p><p>including roads, schools, and health clinics, they noted. </p><p>They nonetheless admitted that no educational programs in </p><p>minority languages were yet available.  Lai Chau is now </p><p>seeking to popularize junior high school education.  Son La </p><p>has yet to achieve even universal primary education, </p><p>although it has set a goal to ensure universal junior high </p><p>school education by 2008. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Despite the predominance of ethnic minority </p><p>populations and the reiteration of the importance of ethnic </p><p>minority policy by the 7th plenum, only about 30 pct of </p><p>provincial-level cadres in Lai Chau are now ethnic </p><p>minorities (rising to 70-80 pct at the local levels), </p><p>officials admitted.  In Son La, provincial officials claimed </p><p>to have no idea of these ratios, but most of the provincial </p><p>officials who met with Pol/C were ethnic Kinh or mixed </p><p>Kinh/minority.  Notably, when the ethnic Kinh "handlers" </p><p>took Pol/C and FSN to visit a "typical" Thai residence (of </p><p>the village party chief), they ignored the well-known Thai </p><p>habit of taking off shoes at the entrance to the house, took </p><p>no note of the row of sandals outside the door and the bare </p><p>feet of the host and hostess, and even appeared nonplussed </p><p>when Pol/C and FSN took off their own shoes before entering. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  Freedom of religion continues to mean different </p><p>things to Americans and Vietnamese officials.  In a recent </p><p>meeting with Ambassador, the new head of the Government </p><p>Committee on Religious Affairs took a generally conciliatory </p><p>line.  Overall, however, the more general CPV view appears </p><p>to be that religion is essentially an inherited </p><p>characteristic, much like ethnicity.  While the CPV\'s own </p><p>history demonstrates how young idealists can be turned into </p><p>Communists by reading seminal documents or listening to a Ho </p><p>Chi Minh, current-day CPV logic appears to try to rule out </p><p>the possibility of conversion after contact with a religious </p><p>believer or first reading of the Bible, Koran, or Buddhist </p><p>teachings.  That may be why the CPV/GVN is seemingly </p><p>reluctant to register new churches (or temples) even within </p><p>the framework of already legal religious organizations, much </p><p>less reach formal acceptance of "new" religious bodies like </p><p>the Ba\'hai, Baptists, or the United Buddhist Church of </p><p>Vietnam.   Alternatively, it is exactly because they are </p><p>well aware of how successfully the CPV\'s ideological and </p><p>administrative base grew underground in the first half of </p><p>the 20th century that CPV leaders remain sharply alive to </p><p>the "dangers" posed in particularly by non-recognized </p><p>Protestants targeting already marginalized ethnic grounds in </p><p>sensitive border provinces, and why they are seeking to </p><p>ensure that all activities in these areas be fully and </p><p>openly "legal" and under their supervision. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
