<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001357 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENFAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI, Media and Communications </p><p>SUBJECT: PRO-GOVERNMENT MEDIA COMMISSION NAMED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   On June 1 Information Minister Jonathan Moyo </p><p>    appointed a six-member Media and Information Commission </p><p>    to license media organizations, accredit journalists, </p><p>    and assume other functions related to controlling the </p><p>    media in Zimbabwe.  The Media and Information </p><p>    Commission is a statutory body mandated by the Access </p><p>    to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA). </p><p>    Moyo named Dr. Tafataona Mahoso, head of the journalism </p><p>    department at Harare Polytechnic and strong supporter </p><p>    of the Mugabe administration and media control, as </p><p>    executive chairman of the Commission.  Moyo also named </p><p>    two former editors of state-controlled newspapers -- </p><p>    Pascal Mukondiwa, former editor of the "Sunday Mail" </p><p>    and Jonathan Maphenduka, former assistant editor of the </p><p>    "Chronicle" -- to the panel.  Other Commission members </p><p>    include retired Information Ministry official Alpinos </p><p>    Makoni; Dr. Rino Zhuwara, the head of Media Studies at </p><p>    the University of Zimbabwe, and Mr. Sephath Mlambo, the </p><p>    principal of the government-run Mkoba Teachers\' </p><p>    College.  All members have been appointed for three </p><p>    years. </p><p> </p><p>2.   In a statement released on June 1, the government </p><p>    said the Commission was set up to ensure that "all </p><p>    Zimbabweans enjoy improved access to information and </p><p>    achieve effective ownership and control of mass media </p><p>    services in the country."  The Commission would also </p><p>    "enforce professional and ethical standards in the </p><p>    media industry, as well as mount investigations and </p><p>    inquiries on media conduct." </p><p> </p><p>3.   The Zimbabwean office of the Media Institute of </p><p>    Southern Africa (MISA) is planning to protest the </p><p>    monolithic, pro-government composition of the </p><p>    Commission.  Media industry leaders, international </p><p>    correspondents and journalists\' unions complained that </p><p>    they were not consulted on the appointments. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Comment: During AIPPA\'s tortuous passage through </p><p>    parliament, critics warned that the Commission was </p><p>    likely to be packed with government supporters and </p><p>    become a rubber stamp for Information Minister Moyo\'s </p><p>    plans for controlling the media in Zimbabwe.  The </p><p>    composition of the Commission\'s membership confirms </p><p>    those fears and sets up another mechanism for increased </p><p>    government control of all media operating in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
