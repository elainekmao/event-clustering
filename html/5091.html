<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 000098 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA AND NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, AF, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN: CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED REPORT ON </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE -- KUWAIT RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 262304 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 5018 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H Jones for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Embassy shared data on Kuwait contributions to Afghan </p><p>assistance with officials of the Kuwait Fund.  Kuwait Fund </p><p>officials confirmed that the GOK has pledged $30 million to </p><p>Afghani assistance, which represents the Tokyo pledge.  They </p><p>were puzzled by the reference to a $15 million "additional </p><p>pledge."  They also noted that $15 million of the $30 million </p><p>pledge has been allocated for development projects, but </p><p>pointed out that no/no disbursements have yet been made. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Embassy suspects that the origin of the $15 million </p><p>"additional pledge" in the Washington matrix may be a comment </p><p>made by Deputy Foreign Minister Ahmed Jarallah during the </p><p>November 2002 visit of Ambassadors Taylor and Johnson (reftel </p><p>B).  Jarallah suggested that Kuwait would give to Afghan </p><p>assistance in the future, but did not/not specify an ammout </p><p>or time frame.  The $15 million "additional pledge" may also </p><p>represent a misundertanding of Kuwait\'s intention to use half </p><p>of its $30 million Tokyo pledge (i.e., $15 million) to </p><p>support the ARTF and Kuwait\'s agreement to consider </p><p>committing the remaining $15 million to support the </p><p>Kandahar-Spin Boldak road project (which the GOK tells us is </p><p>still under consideration).  However, as the Kuwait Fund </p><p>response makes clear, there is no "additional pledge", only </p><p>the $30 million Tokyo pledge. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
