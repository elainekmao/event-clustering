<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000983 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND CWILKENSON </p><p>USAID FOR MAJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Inflation hits 269 percent </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Zimbabwe\'s official inflation has reached </p><p>269 percent, adding to the country\'s economic woes.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) This is the year-on-year rate for April 2003, as </p><p>measured by the Central Statistical Office (CSO)\'s Consumer </p><p>Price Index.  The March-to-March rate was 228 percent.  The </p><p>increase does not yet take into account recent price hikes </p><p>in soft drinks, postage rates, train fares and telephone </p><p>charges.  CSO methodology also precludes factoring in black- </p><p>market rates for fuel, although transport costs are </p><p>otherwise reflected in many product increases. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>3. (U) This is very troubling, but expected, news. As we </p><p>have noted, the GOZ\'s much-ballyhooed goal of double-digit </p><p>inflation for 2003 is no longer feasible.  Locals joke they </p><p>can almost watch prices climb if they stand in front an item </p><p>on the supermarket shelf for five minutes. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) However, economists are gratified that GOZ </p><p>Information Minister Jonathan Moyo has not yet compelled CSO </p><p>statisticians to doctor their numbers.  The opposition press </p><p>reported last week that Moyo instructed business/economics </p><p>reporters from the State media to make reports more upbeat. </p><p>While the CSO\'s CPI methodology is badly outdated, it is </p><p>still a professional undertaking. </p><p> </p><p>Whitehead </p><p></p></div>
