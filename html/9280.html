<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001927 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR MELLE AND CHANDLER </p><p>USDOC FOR UNDERSECRETARY ALDONA AND ITA/IA/JTERPSTRA </p><p>USDA FOR FAS - PAULINE SIMMONS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EAGR, SENV, CA, Softwood lumber </p><p>SUBJECT: SOFTWOOD LUMBER: A MODEST PROPOSAL </p><p> </p><p>This message is sensitive but unclassified; please treat </p><p>accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: We appear to be moving toward yet another </p><p>trade-restrictive, time-limited softwood lumber agreement. If </p><p>so, it might be useful to think now about what we could do to </p><p>come up with a more durable solution while the temporary </p><p>measures are in place.  The fact that current trade law </p><p>forces us to focus almost exclusively on Canadian subsidies </p><p>makes it difficult for either the USG or the GOC to address </p><p>adequately the broad range of interests affected by the issue </p><p>(e.g., U.S. producers more concerned by the quantity of </p><p>Canadian lumber entering the U.S. market than by its price). </p><p>Post proposes that a non-binding assessment by the </p><p>International Joint Commission (IJC) of forest practices, </p><p>state of the lumber industry and related issues could provide </p><p>a broader range of options for resolving the dispute than </p><p>would be possible from a purely trade law perspective.  This </p><p>cable also outlines a notional scope of work for an IJC </p><p>study.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Trade Law Inadequate To Meet Producer Concerns </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Twenty years of trade litigation, export taxes </p><p>and/or import volume restrictions have yet to resolve the </p><p>U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute.  Post believes this is </p><p>because existing trade law is too narrowly focused to deal </p><p>with the broad range of concerns and long-term industry </p><p>trends underlying the dispute.  Trade law forces us to look </p><p>almost exclusively at identifying and countervailing Canadian </p><p>forest management practices that directly or indirectly </p><p>subsidize Canadian lumber manufacturers.  U.S. producers </p><p>often argue publicly that all they want is a level playing </p><p>field, with Canadian timber (and hence, </p><p>lumber) prices "set by the market."  Post firmly believes, </p><p>and the recent WTO panel decision on the countervail case </p><p>appears to confirm, that subsidies exist and threaten </p><p>material injury to U.S. producers.  But even if we assume </p><p>that establishing fairness in price competition can be </p><p>achieved through trade litigation, would that be enough to </p><p>satisfy U.S. producer interests?  Four years of intensive </p><p>discussion, debate and economic analysis convince us that </p><p>even if Canadian provinces were to eliminate all subsidies </p><p>and adopt the U.S. public lands model (an unlikely prospect), </p><p>competitive pressure from Canadian imports would be virtually </p><p>unabated for most U.S. softwood lumber firms.  We have seen </p><p>no credible economic studies to the contrary.  In fact, the </p><p>shake-out of poor performers such as BC-based Doman due to </p><p>current U.S. tariffs may actually be strengthening long-term </p><p>Canadian competitiveness. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Some U.S. producers have proposed quantitative </p><p>import restrictions, combined with punitive tariffs for </p><p>import volumes exceeding those restrictions.  Their interest </p><p>seems to be in limiting Canada\'s share of the U.S. market in </p><p>order to raise prices and increase profit margins for U.S. </p><p>producers.  This might work were it not for the fact that </p><p>substitute suppliers (New Zealand being the latest to join </p><p>the ranks) and alternative products (structural steel) are </p><p>readily available to fill the gap, keeping lumber prices </p><p>below the level at which some U.S. producers can successfully </p><p>compete.  In short, trade litigation might bring the </p><p>Canadians to the negotiating table, and trade negotiations </p><p>might result in import quotas for Canadian lumber, but </p><p>neither will ensure a healthy U.S. lumber industry over the </p><p>long haul. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Other U.S. producers (and some Canadians) say the </p><p>root of the problem is that there is too much lumber flooding </p><p>the market, regardless of source.  They claim that reducing </p><p>annual North American production by ten billion board feet </p><p>would raise prices enough to ensure the long-term health of </p><p>the lumber industry.  They note that such a reduction will </p><p>inevitably happen as the North American industry continues to </p><p>consolidate and integrate.  If this view is correct, the role </p><p>of government would seem to be limited to appropriate </p><p>antitrust surveillance and social safety net support for </p><p>displaced sawmill </p><p>workers, since positive measures to reduce production -- </p><p>e.g., through changes in forestry or environmental policies </p><p>-- risk a strong negative reaction from consumers.  In any </p><p>case, if this "industry in transition" argument is correct, </p><p>Post does not see how current trade law or policy tools could </p><p>be used to make the transition smoother or less painful. </p><p> </p><p>A Role for the International Joint Commission? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The International Joint Commission has an enviable </p><p>record of success in resolving bilateral disputes, going back </p><p>ninety years.  While its remit has been largely limited to </p><p>environmental matters, its success in resolving sensitive </p><p>boundary water resource management disputes make it a </p><p>reasonable venue for assessment of a dispute over long-term </p><p>management of North America\'s forest resources.  In order for </p><p>such a study to be done under IJC auspices, both the USG and </p><p>GOC would have to finance it and agree on its scope of work. </p><p>When one considers the amount of taxpayer money both </p><p>governments have spent over the past 20 years on litigation, </p><p>discussion and negotiation, a study that broadens the scope </p><p>of interests covered beyond those usually addressed under </p><p>trade law, within limits set by both governments, without </p><p>prejudice to any existing policy, litigation or negotiation </p><p>seems like a bargain.  Further, we believe an IJC study with </p><p>an appropriate scope of work could provide a more creative </p><p>and comprehensive roadmap to resolving the dispute than has </p><p>been </p><p>possible heretofore. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The IJC could, as directed by both governments, </p><p>contract with independent experts for studies on any or all </p><p>of the following elements: </p><p> </p><p>-- The current state of the lumber industry (binational, </p><p>national, regional); industry trends (binational, national </p><p>and regional); the degree of cross-border integration and </p><p>prospects for further integration or industry consolidation; </p><p>socio-economic impact of integration/consolidation </p><p>(binational, national, regional); global industry trends and </p><p>their impact on the industry (binational, national, </p><p>regional); industry trends in substitute products (global, </p><p>binational, national, regional). </p><p> </p><p>-- Current forest management practices and principles </p><p>(state/province and federal); recommendations for regional or </p><p>species-based best practices; economic impact of current </p><p>practices and recommended best practices by region, nation </p><p>and binationally; environmental impact of current practices </p><p>and recommended best practices by region, nation and </p><p>binationally; species-specific recommendations and </p><p>economic/environmental assessments; economic and </p><p>environmenatl assessments of alternative or complementary </p><p>economic activities </p><p>on forest lands, public and private. </p><p> </p><p>-- Prospects for development of employment alternatives in </p><p>regions identified as most likely to be negatively affected </p><p>by any of the above-mentioned trends or recommendations. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  We recognize that this would be an ambitious </p><p>undertaking, even for the IJC.  However, faced with the </p><p>prospect of anothe 20 years of doing what we have always done </p><p>and getting the same results over and over again, we believe </p><p>it would be worth doing.  It would certainly show greater </p><p>concern for the interests of the average taxpayer than what </p><p>we have managed to do to date.  Post would welcome comments </p><p>from interested Washington agencies on the feasibility and </p><p>utility of a non-binding IJC study. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
