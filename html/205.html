<p>UNCLAS DHAKA 02166 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, BG </p><p>SUBJECT:  BANGLADESH: 1987 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 42378 </p><p> </p><p>1.  BANGLADESH. </p><p> </p><p>2.  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PALESTINE LIBERATION </p><p>ORGANIZATION: </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZES THE </p><p>PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, WHICH MAINTAINS A </p><p>DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN DHAKA.  FOUR PLO REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>APPEAR ON THE DIPLOMATIC LIST, AND APPARENTLY HAVE </p><p>FULL DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES, INCLUDING IMMUNITY AND USE </p><p>OF THE POUCH.  AN ASSOCIATION OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY </p><p>PALESTINIAN STUDENTS IS ACTIVE IN THE PORT CITY OF </p><p>CHITTAGONG.  THE ASSOCIATION IS REPORTEDLY AFFILIATED </p><p>WITH THE AL-FATAH GROUP OF THE PLO.  THE STUDENTS HAVE </p><p>DEMONSTRATED AGAINST U.S. POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>AND HAVE BURNED EFFIGIES OF PRESIDENT REAGAN AND ISRAELI </p><p>LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DOMESTIC INSURGENCY - THE SHANTI BAHINI: </p><p> </p><p>A SIMMERING INSURGENT MOVEMENT IS ACTIVE IN THE </p><p>CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS REGION WHERE SOME 600,000 TRIBAL </p><p>PEOPLE LIVE.  THE MOVEMENT REFLECTS CONCERN THAT THEIR </p><p>TRADITIONAL WAY OF LIFE IN THE HILL AREAS WAS BEING </p><p>UNDERMINED BY SETTLERS WHO MOVED THERE FROM THE </p><p>OVERPOPULATED PLAINS.  THE INSURGENTS ARE DEMANDING </p><p>AUTONOMY FOR THE CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS WITHIN THE </p><p>BANGLADESH STATE.  ARMED CLASHES HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN </p><p>GOVERNMENT FORCES AND A GROUP OF TRIBAL INSURGENTS KNOWN </p><p>AS THE SHANTI BAHINI ("PEACE FORCE").  THE SHANTI </p><p>BAHINI HAVE CONDUCTED HIT-AND-RUN RAIDS AGAINST MILITARY </p><p>PERSONNEL AND BENGALI SETTLEMENTS.  OFFICIAL SOURCES </p><p>CLAIM THAT IN 1987, 122 PERSONS WERE KILLED, 68 PERSONS </p><p>WERE INJURED, AND 21 PERSONS WERE KIDNAPPED IN SHANTI </p><p>BAHINI VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN: </p><p> </p><p>THE BANGLADESH GOVERNMENT HAS NO  SPECIFIC RESPONSE </p><p>CAPABILITY BEYOND EXISTING POLICE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE </p><p>PROCEDURES.  THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE IS AN ADJUNCT </p><p>OF SPECIAL BRANCH, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INTERNAL </p><p>SECURITY MATTERS.  THERE ARE NO DESIGNATED ANTI- </p><p>TERRORISM POLICE.  ANY ARMED RESPONSE TO A TERRORISM </p><p>SITUATION WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE HANDLED BY THE </p><p>MILITARY, WHICH HAS NO KNOWN ANTI-TERRORIST CAPABILITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM: </p><p> </p><p>POST IS UNAWARE OF ANY ACTION TAKEN BY THE BANGLADESH </p><p>JUDICIAL SYSTEM WITH RESPECT OF MATTERS RELATING TO </p><p>TERRORISM AFFECTING AMERICAN CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  POSITION IN INTERNATIONAL FORA: </p><p> </p><p>THE BANGLADESH GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED </p><p>MEASURES TO PREVENT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA, BANGLADESH HAS CONDEMNED AS CRIMINAL </p><p>ALL ACTS, METHODS, AND PRACTICES OF TERRORISM WHEREVER </p><p>AND BY WHOMEVER COMMITTED.  TO POST\'S KNOWLEDGE, THE </p><p>BDG HAS ENDORSED INTERNATIONAL ANTI-TERRORISM </p><p>CONVENTIONS.  BANGLADESH HAS SUPPORTED EFFORTS WITHIN </p><p>THE SOUTH ASIAN ASSOCIATION FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION </p><p>(SAARC) TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM.  BANGLADESH\'S UNGA VOTING RECORD ON TERRORISM </p><p>IS UNAVAILABLE AT POST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DE PREE </p><p></p></div>
