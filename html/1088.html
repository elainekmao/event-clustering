ON MAY 22, THE ZIMBABWE SUPREME COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF </p><p>THE INDEPENDENTLY OWNED "THE STANDARD NEWSPAPER" EDITOR, </p><p>MARK CHAVUNDUKA, AND CHIEF REPORTER, RAY CHOTO, WHO </p><p>CHALLENGED THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SECTION 50(2) OF THE </p><p>LAW AND ORDER MAINTENANCE ACT (LOMA)(REFTEL).  THE COURT </p><p>FOUND THAT THE LOMA SECTION 50, WHICH MAKES IT A CRIME TO </p><p>WRITE "FALSE STATEMENTS THAT ARE LIKELY TO CAUSE FEAR AND, </p><p>ALARM AND DESPONDENCY AMONG THE PUBLIC" CONTRAVENED SECTION </p><p>20(1) OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH PROVIDES FOR FREEDOM OF </p><p>EXPRESSION. THE SUPREME COURT DECISION WILL NOW RESULT IN </p><p>ALL CHARGES AGAINST THE TWO JOURNALISTS UNDER THE LOMA </p><p>BEING DROPPED IN THE MAGISTRATES COURT.  THE TWO </p><p>JOURNALISTS WERE CHARGED UNDER THE LOMA IN JANUARY 1999, </p><p>AFTER PUBLISHING A STORY IN THE STANDARD REPORTING THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAD FOILED A "COUP" ATTEMPT.  THEY WERE ARRESTED </p><p>BY THE POLICE AND CREDIBLY ALLEGED THAT THEY WERE TORTURED </p><p>BY THE MILITARY DURING THEIR DETENTION.  THE NEWSMEN WERE </p><p>OUT ON BAIL AND HAD FACED A SEVEN-YEAR JAIL SENTENCE IF </p><p>THEY HAD BEEN CONVICTED. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE JUDGMENT ISSUED BY CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY GUBBAY HELD </p><p>THAT SECTION 50(2) OF THE LOMA WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AS IT </p><p>LIMITED FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ESPECIALLY THAT OF THE PRESS. </p><p>THE COURT FOUND THAT SECTION 50 (2) WAS VAGUE AND </p><p>OPPRESSIVE AND LEFT IT TO THE GOVERNMENT TO REWRITE THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02763  231522Z </p><p>SECTION. </p><p> </p><p>3. COMMENT: THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND TIME IN THE POST- </p><p>INDEPENDENCE ZIMBABWE THAT A SECTION OF THE LOMA HAS BEEN </p><p>FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  THIS IS A MAJOR VICTORY FOR </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTIES WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HAVE THE LOMA </p><p>STRICKEN FROM THE LEGAL BOOKS.  HOWEVER, OTHER SECTIONS OF </p><p>THE LOMA REMAIN IN FORCE AND HAVE RECENTLY BEEN INVOKED BY </p><p>THE MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS, DUMISO DABENGWA, WHO CITED </p><p>THE ESCALATING POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN FACE OF THE SCHEDULED </p><p>GENERAL ELECTIONS ON JUNE 24 AND 25.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD# </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
