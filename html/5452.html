LOUSTAUNAU </p><p>TREASURY PASS FEDERAL RESERVE </p><p>NSC FOR J. MYERS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EINV, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: SHOW ME THE MONEY: INSIGHTS INTO THE UAE BUDGET </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Classified by A/DCM Tom Williams for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Summary and comment:  Like so many countries in this part of </p><p>the world, the UAE does not publish reliable or complete fiscal data. </p><p>Only the federal budget -- which accounts for about a quarter of the </p><p>consolidated fiscal position -- is publicly available. According to </p><p>the IMF, errors and omissions in the budget averaged 13 percent of </p><p>GDP in the 1990s.  A/DCM and Econoff met with Undersecretary of the </p><p>Abu Dhabi Department of Finance Ju\'an Salem Al-Dhaheri on January 27 </p><p>(the emirate of Abu Dhabi accounts for more than half of the UAE\'s </p><p>total GDP and is the major contributor to the federal budget) to </p><p>glean some insight into the budget-making process.  In a surprisingly </p><p>candid meeting, Al-Dhaheri admitted that ADIA\'s significant </p><p>investment income does not factor into the budget.  He commented on </p><p>the Abu Dhabi Finance Department\'s own investments, which include </p><p>lucrative holdings in the local real estate market. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) Summary and comment continued: Al-Dhaheri noted that the </p><p>UAEG would have "no problem" financing the budget deficit this year </p><p>but admitted that investment income had taken a hit the last few </p><p>years due to the sagging global economy. Luckily, only 70 percent of </p><p>the budget is actually spent each year and this year some projects </p><p>are being delayed -- beneficial because the Abu Dhabi budget operates </p><p>on a pay-as-you-go system.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Counting The Revenue... </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C/NF) Al-Dhaheri noted that the Finance Department works with </p><p>ADNOC -- the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company -- to determine the </p><p>average oil price for the budget, and estimate oil revenue for the </p><p>coming year.  The Finance Department generally takes a conservative </p><p>stand on oil price assumptions and tends to factor in a lower-than- </p><p>realistic oil price for safe measure.  The assumed oil price is </p><p>adjusted quarterly, using the rolling average oil price during the </p><p>last three quarters as a basis. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C/NF) The Abu Dhabi Finance Department does not factor the </p><p>investment income from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority\'s (ADIA) </p><p>significant foreign assets into the budget or consider it revenue. </p><p> (Note: In reality, ADIA operates as a stand-by source of petty </p><p>cash -- and not so petty cash -- for Abu Dhabi, and the organization </p><p>maintains a certain percentage of liquid investments in order to meet </p><p>the unpredictable demands of financing the federal budget deficit, </p><p>large military purchases, and other sensitive projects outside the </p><p>regular budget. </p><p>End note.)  Al- Dhaheri emphasized that the UAEG finances its budget </p><p>deficit each year from ADIA, not from the domestic banks like some </p><p>other countries in the region.  He noted that the habit in the </p><p>region of laying off government debt on local banks is bad for </p><p>business, and bad for the financial reputation of the country. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C/NF) Al-Dhaheri mentioned that -- separate from ADIA  -- the </p><p>Abu Dhabi Finance Department invests in local real estate and counts </p><p>this income as budget revenue; the Department receives an average </p><p>rate of return of 15 percent on real estate in Abu Dhabi, and 10 </p><p>percent respectively in Dubai.  Al-Dhaheri believes that the current </p><p>practice in Dubai of providing long-term leases (up to 99-years) to </p><p>foreigners unnecessarily invites competition into the market and </p><p>depresses investment returns on real estate.  Al-Dhaheri perceives </p><p>that foreigners circumvent the law requiring that they and they </p><p>alone occupy the properties for which they have purchased long-term </p><p>leases, and instead sublet their properties to others, in effect </p><p>creating unnecessary (and unplanned) competition for UAE nationals. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>...And Limiting Expenditures </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C/NF) Many expenditures are omitted from the budget, including </p><p>transfers from Abu Dhabi to the northern emirates as well as </p><p>transfers of foreign aid abroad.  Abu Dhabi budgets for all federal </p><p>programs -- education, health, highway infrastructure, for example </p><p>-- in Dubai and the northern emirates, but Al-Dhaheri confirmed that </p><p>most transfers from Abu Dhabi to the northern emirates occur outside </p><p>of the budget and are authorized by Sheikh Zayid himself.  Sheikh </p><p>Zayid also generously grants foreign aid to countries without </p><p>consideration of the budget, suggesting that his extra-budgetary </p><p>outlays are funded prior to all others. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C/NF) Al-Dhaheri is keen to balance the federal budget during </p><p>his tenure at the Finance Department, and cut back on government </p><p>waste.  He noted that Abu Dhabi departments -- the spendthrifts of </p><p>the UAE -- use only about 70 percent of the monies allocated to </p><p>them each fiscal year.  They are automatically provided inflated </p><p>budgets, but do not have the capacity to absorb all of the projects </p><p>slated for the year. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C/NF) Specific projects, which lie outside the budgets of </p><p>individual departments, are sometimes delayed to reduce the </p><p>federal government\'s fiscal deficit. Al-Dhaheri intimated that </p><p>the Finance Department follows cash-basis accounting procedures </p><p>-- costs are subtracted in the period in which they are paid </p><p>for by cash disbursements (when payment for projects is due), </p><p>rather than allocated in advance for the fiscal year. This method </p><p>allows the UAEG to simply postpone large projects until the next </p><p>fiscal year if oil prices suddenly drop and revenues are less than </p><p>expected.  Al-Dhaheri also confirmed that projects in Abu Dhabi </p><p>receive priority over projects in other emirates. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
