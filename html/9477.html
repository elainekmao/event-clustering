<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 THE HAGUE 001827 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/WCI - PROSPER/MILLER, EUR - JONES, IO - </p><p>SWIGERT, L - TAFT, EUR/SCE - JONES/GREGORIAN, L/EUR - </p><p>LAHNE, DRL, INR/WCAD - SPRIGG, USUN - ROSTOW </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 FIVE YEARS AFTER CLOSURE ICTY </p><p>TAGS: HR, KAWC, KJUS, NL, PHUM, PREL, SR, ICTY </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTY: PRESIDENT MERON URGES USG TO OPPOSE DEL </p><p>PONTE RENEWAL </p><p> </p><p>1.  Classified by Charge d\'Affaires, a.i., Daniel R. Russel </p><p>for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary.  President Theodor Meron of the </p><p>International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia </p><p>(ICTY) met with the Ambassador on July 16 to convey his </p><p>serious concerns about the performance of Chief Prosecutor </p><p>Carla Del Ponte and the risk the renewal of her tenure </p><p>would pose to the completion strategy.  Meron urged the USG </p><p>to oppose renewal and expressed reservations about a one </p><p>year extension of her mandate.  Meron further advised that </p><p>the UN secretariat had contacted his chief of staff on July </p><p>15 to "float" the idea that no action be taken by the </p><p>Security Council in September and that Del Ponte  term </p><p>simply be allowed to lapse.  Under such an approach, which </p><p>Meron found promising, the Deputy Prosecutors of the ICTY </p><p>and ICTR would serve as "acting" prosecutors of their </p><p>respective offices until replacements were named.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------ </p><p>Del Ponte  Weak Penal Policy and Management </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) President Meron (protect), an American and former </p><p>Counselor for Public International Law at the State </p><p>Department, discussed in frank terms his unease with Carla </p><p>Del Ponte  leadership of the Office of the Prosecutor </p><p>(OTP).  Meron observed that for the USG to persuade </p><p>skeptics that it remained committed to the vigorous </p><p>prosecution of war crimes despite its principled opposition </p><p>to the International Criminal Court, it was essential for </p><p>the Chapter VII model of a war crimes tribunal represented </p><p>by the ICTY and ICTR to succeed both in terms of achieving </p><p>its mission and finishing its work in a finite period of </p><p>time.  In this context he commented that Del Ponte had both </p><p>strengths and weaknesses.  Meron thought she was "very </p><p>good" in sensitizing governments to the importance of </p><p>capturing outstanding fugitives and delivering them to the </p><p>Tribunal.  She has "pushed like a bulldozer -- in a </p><p>positive sense"  to bring indictees into custody. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Del Ponte  two principle weaknesses according to </p><p>Meron were with respect to penal policy and management. </p><p>Meron explained that Del Ponte is "primarily a media person </p><p>who is primarily interested in her own legacy."  She has </p><p>"absolutely no idea about management" and is "not in </p><p>control of her staff."  He described "tremendous unrest" in </p><p>the OTP, noting that a senior OTP official had met with him </p><p>to convey a detailed litany of concerns about the poor </p><p>management of the office and the threat it posed to </p><p>achieving completion strategy targets.   Meron provided a </p><p>confidential memorandum of that conversation reporting the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>official\'s view that "the current Prosecutor lacks the </p><p>required vision, lacks the needed managerial competence, </p><p>and lacks the commitment to the completion strategies that </p><p>will be necessary to bring them about as promised." </p><p>(Note:  The memcon, which provides examples in both the </p><p>ICTY and ICTR to support these conclusions, is being secure </p><p>faxed to S/WCI.   End note.)  On penal policy, Meron noted </p><p>that the OTP brings prosecutions that are too broad in </p><p>scope which result in unnecessarily lengthy and resource </p><p>consuming trials.  Instead of focusing on a few significant </p><p>charges that are supported by strong evidence, the OTP </p><p>brings indictments with too many charges of which many are </p><p>ultimately not readily provable.  He added that the </p><p>presiding judge of a trial chamber had complained to him </p><p>this week that in a small case with a mid-level defendant, </p><p>the OTP had informed the chamber that it planned to present </p><p>80 to 90 witnesses.  This request prompted the defense to </p><p>request a similar number of witnesses, guaranteeing a long </p><p>and complex trial.  "This is no way to run a court," Meron </p><p>observed. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The Ambassador asked Meron whether vesting the </p><p>management functions in OTP in another official might be a </p><p>way of addressing this weakness while allowing Del Ponte to </p><p>focus on other matters.  Meron agreed that the OTP had a </p><p>number of senior officials who could be very effective </p><p>managers, but said that Del Ponte did not give them the </p><p>necessary authority to play that role.  Further, the kinds </p><p>of management deficiencies Meron was flagging related to </p><p>core prosecutorial functions such as determining which </p><p>indictments to bring, the number of charges, which and how </p><p>many witnesses to call, and where to deploy prosecutorial </p><p>resources.  Meron also said that Del Ponte actively </p><p>undercut her subordinates when they sought to make such </p><p>decisions.  Embassy Legal Counselor noted that an OTP </p><p>attorney had advised him last week that Del Ponte had </p><p>interceded to reject a plea agreement that the attorney, in </p><p>coordination with senior OTP managers,  had negotiated with </p><p>a defendant.  As a result, an accused who would have been </p><p>guaranteed a sentence in a 15 to 20 year timeframe would </p><p>now go to trial because the Chief Prosecutor had, for </p><p>optics reasons, insisted on pressing for a 15 to 25 year </p><p>range. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Meron, based on his conversations with Del Ponte </p><p>and others in OTP as well as his observation of how the OTP </p><p>was drafting indictments and trying cases, has concluded </p><p>that Del Ponte "is not interested the completion </p><p>strategy."  He acknowledged that in conversation with the </p><p>Chief Prosecutor this week she had expressed interest in </p><p>working with Meron on a security council resolution that </p><p>would constrain future indictments.  Meron attributed this </p><p>approach reflected her growing unease about the renewal of </p><p>her tenure and noted that even if she signed off on such a </p><p>resolution, her management deficiencies would threaten its </p><p>implementation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------ </p><p>Renewal Options and Letting the Mandate Lapse </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Meron said that Del Ponte told him this week that </p><p>she understood the USG was supporting the British idea for </p><p>the splitting of the ICTR and ICTY functions.  Del Ponte </p><p>also told Meron that she understood that the USG would drop </p><p>its effort to press for a one year term.  Meron expressed </p><p>to the Ambassador his support for the splitting of the </p><p>prosecutorial functions noting that the ICTR deserves a </p><p>"first class prosecutor."  He also noted that concerns </p><p>about divergent penal policies arising from such a split </p><p>were unwarranted because the appeals chamber would continue </p><p>to preside over both tribunals, thereby ensuring a </p><p>consistency in approach and jurisprudence.  Commenting on </p><p>the possibility of a one year renewal, Meron expressed his </p><p>concern that a such an approach (as opposed to nonrenewal) </p><p>would leave a "diminished" prosecutor in power and </p><p>encourage fugitives and countries in the region to "wait </p><p>out" the end of her term and not cooperate with the OTP. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Meron noted that a legal officer from the UN </p><p>Secretariat had contacted his Chief of Staff yesterday to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>"float" the idea of simply allowing Del Ponte  term to </p><p>lapse in September without any Security Council action. </p><p>Such a lapse would result in a de facto splitting of the </p><p>prosecutorial functions in the OTP as the Deputy </p><p>Prosecutors of the ICTY and ICTR would become the "acting" </p><p>prosecutors for their respective tribunals.  The UN legal </p><p>officer advised that one question was whether the Deputy </p><p>Prosecutors under such a scenario would have the authority </p><p>to sign indictments and exercise other core functions of </p><p>their office.  Meron  office replied that this would not </p><p>be a problem because Rule 38(B) of the ICTY Rules of </p><p>Evidence and Procedure explicitly provides that "The Deputy </p><p>Prosecutor shall exercise the functions of the Prosecutor </p><p>in the event of the latter  absence from duty or </p><p>inability to act ...." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Summing up, Meron explained that "two or three </p><p>years ago" having a Chief Prosecutor who was especially </p><p>vigorous in pressing governments in the region to apprehend </p><p>fugitives may have overshadowed other weaknesses.  At this </p><p>point in the Tribunal  life, however, particularly given </p><p>the dramatic changes in Belgrade, Meron believed that it </p><p>was much more important for the institution to have a Chief </p><p>Prosecutor with the sound penal policy and effective </p><p>management skills that are essential to implementing the </p><p>completion strategy.  In Meron  analysis, Del Ponte fails </p><p>to meet these requirements. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Meron  description of the problems in the OTP </p><p>tracks Embassy\'s observations and has been detailed in </p><p>previous reporting.  What is new is that the perception of </p><p>a floundering OTP has become so pervasive that it has </p><p>become common knowledge in the Chambers.  The indication </p><p>that the UN Secretariat is exploring the idea of letting </p><p>the prosecutor\'s mandate lapse is intriguing and suggests </p><p>that the USG may have additional leverage and options in </p><p>pursuing its positions with respect to the renewal of Del </p><p>Ponte  mandate.  End Comment. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
