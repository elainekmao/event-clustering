GUATEMALA 191 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: The following is an update of significant </p><p>recent developments in the labor sector.  Topics include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Teachers Back in School </p><p> </p><p>-- Ambassador Raises GSP with GOG </p><p> </p><p>-- Ambassador Flags Labor Rights in AmCham Speech </p><p> </p><p>-- MOL Coordinating GOG Response to GSP </p><p> </p><p>-- GOG CAFTA Team Meeting with Unions/Employers </p><p> </p><p>-- GOG Announces Aid to Campesinos </p><p> </p><p>-- Labor Snippets (Pepsi, Failing Banks, Employment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Teachers Back in School, Brother of Teacher Union Murdered </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Teachers returned to class on March 12 after 51 days </p><p>of work stoppage (Ref A).  An accord was reached on March 11 </p><p>and signed on March 12 by the National Teachers Assembly </p><p>(ANM) with the GOG after 11 negotiating sessions mediated by </p><p>Archbishop Quezada Toruno.  The accord includes the </p><p>following: a wage increase of Q150 ($19.23/month); </p><p>participation by teachers in 2004 education budget planning; </p><p>a commitment by the teachers to work an extra hour per day to </p><p>make up for time lost during the strike (which the labor and </p><p>appeals courts declared illegal); an increase of annual </p><p>working hours from 900 to 1000; 22,000 new scholarships for </p><p>students to defray costs; and creation of a joint committee </p><p>to discuss the issues of pay for February and disciplinary </p><p>sanctions against strikers. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) President of Congress Efrain Rios Montt publicly </p><p>declared that funds for the wage increase would come from the </p><p>existing education budget, and backed off an earlier pledge </p><p>by President Portillo and Rios Montt to apply the raise (then </p><p>at only Q100) to all public and private employees. </p><p>Meanwhile, teachers celebrated and students returned to </p><p>class.  If implemented, the raise would cost the ministry </p><p>Q163 million ($21 million), and brings teachers salaries to a </p><p>new range, depending on experience, of Q2,032-4,446 </p><p>($260-570)/month.  As the strike wore on, President Portillo </p><p>had threatened to expand the National Program of </p><p>Self-Management for Educational Development (PRONADE), which </p><p>provides resources to communities which wish to organize and </p><p>participate in the management of a new local school, and </p><p>currently serves 3,648 schools (which operated during the </p><p>strike) and 310,000 students.  Teachers in PRONADE schools </p><p>are contracted annually and do not receive benefits. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) In a meeting with the Ambassador on March 12, </p><p>Education Minister Mario Torres was upbeat about the accord </p><p>with the teachers, calling it a "win-win" situation.  Torres </p><p>downplayed the seriousness of the strike action, saying </p><p>teachers are "prone to strike in the final year of an </p><p>administration," and that the GOG had successfully averted a </p><p>strike through negotiations in the previous years of the </p><p>Portillo Administration.  Torres estimated that only 20,000 </p><p>of the 80,000 public school teachers ever participated in the </p><p>demonstrations at any one time.  (Comment:  The timing of </p><p>this strike cost Torres the chance to run for Congress in </p><p>November.  To do so, he was required by election law to </p><p>resign his executive branch position in January, six months </p><p>before the beginning of the campaign period.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Torres said that the GOG is not willing to pay the </p><p>strikers for the lost month of February.  The GOG is also </p><p>firm about firing 10,000 of the strikers.  The minister said </p><p>that in response to the strike, the ministry will publicize </p><p>the fact that GOG spending on education goes well beyond the </p><p>education ministry budget figure (e.g. school-building under </p><p>the Social Funds Institute) and is equivalent to nearly 4% of </p><p>GDP.  Teacher-training will continue but classes will be held </p><p>on Saturdays instead of during the school week.  The joint </p><p>committee to discuss unresolved issues will meet daily and an </p><p>agreement will be signed only after all issues are </p><p>negotiated.  Torres said that President Portillo will issue a </p><p>Governmental decree instituting a gradual decentralization </p><p>strategy to put school management (including hiring) in the </p><p>hands of parents.  (The President did so on March 13.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The 51-day teachers strike reportedly cost the lives </p><p>of four teachers; three in traffic accidents during marches </p><p>or mobilizations, one of suicide.  Carlos Fuentes, brother of </p><p>Moises Fuentes, one of the principal strike leaders, was </p><p>reportedly murdered by unknown assassins in Mazatenango </p><p>province sometime during the week of March 4.  Fuentes told </p><p>press on March 8 that he was not sure whether his brother\'s </p><p>murder had any connection to his participation in the strike. </p><p> As of March 12, the case had not been transferred to the </p><p>Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Unionists. </p><p>Ambassador Raises GSP with GOG </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) On March 11, Ambassador Hamilton raised the need </p><p>for more vigorous investigation of unresolved crimes against </p><p>labor leaders with Attorney General de Leon and Minister of </p><p>Government Reyes Calderon.  The Ambassador warned that </p><p>languishing investigations of violent crimes against labor </p><p>leaders will come under increasing scrutiny as a decision on </p><p>GSP petitions looms in mid-April.  The GOG must start </p><p>focusing on specific cases and arresting and prosecuting </p><p>those responsible.  The Ambassador cited the three most </p><p>recent murder cases (of Carlos Francisco Guzman Lanuza, on </p><p>November 27, 2002; Baudilio Cermeno Ramirez, on December 21, </p><p>2001; and Oswaldo Monzon Lima, in June 2000).  Both ministers </p><p>promised to work together (the National Civil Police are </p><p>responsible for early stages of an investigation, and the </p><p>Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Unionists for the </p><p>latter, including warrants for arrests) to make progress on </p><p>cases in the short run.  De Leon said he would activate the </p><p>Public Ministry\'s Special Prosecutor\'s office to resolve </p><p>these cases. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) RefTels B-G report on the Ambassador\'s meetings </p><p>with President Portillo on February 25, with Labor Minister </p><p>Victor Moreira on March 3, the Attorney General on January 23 </p><p>and February 28, and Economy Minister Ramirez on January 21. </p><p>In each meeting, the Ambassador raised USG concern over labor </p><p>rights and the need for the GOG to make additional efforts to </p><p>respond to GSP petition cases and concerns.  The Ambassador </p><p>will discuss the petitions with AFL-CIO and International </p><p>Labor Rights Fund representatives on March 24. </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Cites Importance of Labor Rights in AmCham Speech </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The Ambassador used the occasion of a public speech </p><p>before the Guatemala-American Chamber of Commerce on the </p><p>challenges and opportunities facing Guatemala to highlight </p><p>the importance of labor rights in the context of negotiations </p><p>on a U.S.-Central Amercia Free Trade Agreement.  Earlier </p><p>remarks to the press by the Ambassador after he met with </p><p>Labor Minister Moreira on March 3 were reported the next day </p><p>in prominent daily "Prensa Libre" under the headline "He </p><p>Brings Petition for Labor Improvements."  Though the reporter </p><p>misquoted the Ambassador saying "Guatemala continues to </p><p>violate the right to association" (this conclusion should </p><p>have been ascribed to the GSP petitions).  However, the </p><p>article accurately stated USG concerns about violence against </p><p>union leaders and labor rights and gave background </p><p>information about pending GSP petitions against Guatemala. </p><p> </p><p>MOL Coordinating GOG Response to GSP </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) In an interview televised on March 5, Labor Minister </p><p>Moreira stated that the USG is concerned about progress on </p><p>the cases included in GSP petitions.  He said the Labor </p><p>Ministry is seeking the cooperation of the Public Ministry </p><p>and the judiciary to prepare an official response to the GSP </p><p>petitions by the end of April.  (LabAtt subsequently urged </p><p>the ministry to complete its report sooner, in time for the </p><p>April 15 interagency review of GSP petitions.)  An officer of </p><p>the Supreme Court later called LabAtt asking for Spanish text </p><p>of the GSP petitions, which the MOL later provided. </p><p> </p><p>GOG CAFTA Team Meeting with Labor Sector </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) On the trade front, GOG CAFTA negotiator Salomon </p><p>Cohen invited labor sector representatives (from unions and </p><p>employer organizations) to a discussion with negotiators on </p><p>March 12.  This is the second such forum since CAFTA talks </p><p>began, and is sponsored by AID\'s regional trade capacity </p><p>program.  Labor Vice Minister Antonio Monzon is currently </p><p>leading the GOG CAFTA team on labor issues, and attended the </p><p>session with Cohen.  (Note: Luis Fernandez, lawyer for DYMEL </p><p>Corp., has resigned as GOG CAFTA negotiator for labor issues. </p><p> End Note.)  Homero Fuentes, Guatemala\'s foremost (pro-union) </p><p>labor expert, told LabAtt that the session was hampered by </p><p>low union attendance and a preoccupation with particular </p><p>union interests.  Fuentes said the Danish Aid Council and </p><p>Friedrich Ebert Foundation will attempt to bring the key </p><p>labor federations together to focus on the CAFTA negotiation </p><p>in coming months.  A conference of Central American unions </p><p>(ORIT) will meet in Guatemala the week of March 24 to share </p><p>views on the CAFTA negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) CACIF Labor Commission Chief Carlos Arias </p><p>requested an urgent meeting of the Commission with EconCouns </p><p>and LabAtt on March 12 to discuss what he perceived as </p><p>Cohen\'s intention to "railroad through" an ill-considered </p><p>plan to establish duplicative forums among the GOG, labor and </p><p>employer representatives to discuss four labor themes as part </p><p>of the CAFTA labor talks:  1) child labor, 2) occupational </p><p>health and safety, 3) freedom of association, and 4) </p><p>discrimination.  EconCouns said that Cohen had told him that </p><p>his efforts were part of an outreach strategy to labor, not </p><p>an attempt to put specific labor issues onto the CAFTA </p><p>negotiating table.  LabAtt and EconCouns encouraged CACIF to </p><p>work with the GOG CAFTA negotiating team to address </p><p>perceptions of Guatemala\'s weakness protecting fundamental </p><p>labor rights.  Any CAFTA agreement must include a binding </p><p>labor clause.  The Chile agreement reportedly includes an </p><p>innovative mechanism to sanction labor rights violators. </p><p>LabAtt noted that Guatemala still has much work to do to </p><p>comply with its ILO commitments.  Arias said CACIF would </p><p>support an agreement which binds each member country to </p><p>enforce its own labor laws and international conventions it </p><p>is party to, and would also support a mechanism to punish </p><p>violators rather than sanctioning sectors or countries </p><p>wholesale, as under GSP. </p><p> </p><p>GOG Announces Aid to Campesinos </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) On February 10 and March 3, campesino groups blocked </p><p>highways and marched to demand relief for effects of the </p><p>coffee crisis, and in support of the teachers\' strike.  On </p><p>March 10, President Portillo promised Q100 million ($12.8 </p><p>million) in response to demands from the Agrarian Platform, </p><p>the ad-hoc umbrella organization of campesino groups which </p><p>has been in dialogue with the GOG since last year.  Campesino </p><p>demands include food aid to 50,000 families; additional </p><p>resources for FONTIERRAS, the government land bank, to </p><p>purchase land for the landless; a subsidy and program to rent </p><p>land to campesinos; an end to efforts to dislodge squatters; </p><p>publication of the names of plantations with labor problems; </p><p>and support to small and medium-sized coffee producers. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) In February, the Committee for Campesino Development </p><p>(CODECA) reported results of a survey of 7,507 workers on 86 </p><p>coffee, sugar, rubber, ranch and banana plantations showing </p><p>that only 13% of these workers received the legally-mandated </p><p>minimum wage ($4.00/day) or more.  The lowest-paid twenty </p><p>percent of the workers received less than $2.50/day.  Coffee </p><p>and sugar producers complained in February of the lack of </p><p>workers in Guatemala, who are increasingly seeking better </p><p>wages across the border in Mexico.  (In Mexico, a worker is </p><p>paid up to $5 for 100 pounds of coffee beans picked, while in </p><p>Guatemala the rate is closer to $2.50.)  In addition to </p><p>increased emigration, press reported that many coffee pickers </p><p>stayed home this harvest season falsely expecting payment for </p><p>their services as members of the civil self defense patrols </p><p>during the 36-year internal conflict.  Coffee sector </p><p>employment declined from 655,267 in the 1999/2000 harvest to </p><p>588,332 in 2000/2001, and was only 463,859 this year. </p><p> </p><p>Labor Snippets </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) FESTRAS, the sectoral union for beverage workers, </p><p>has appealed for international solidarity in support of its </p><p>efforts to compel collective bargaining at Pepsi\'s local </p><p>bottler, Mariposa.  Unlike at Coke\'s bottler, which is 90% </p><p>unionized and recently reached a new collective bargaining </p><p>agreement with its union, Mariposa\'s rate of unionization is </p><p>less than 5%.  The labor code requires 25% union membership </p><p>to compel collective bargaining.  FESTRAS argued (and lost in </p><p>court) that the 25% membership requirement should not apply </p><p>in companies which had entered into previous collective </p><p>bargaining agreements.  It also believes that Mariposa fired </p><p>100 workers in 2002 to rid itself of unionized workers. </p><p>Mariposa management denied this allegation and told LabAtt </p><p>that the reduction was due to closure of a line of production </p><p>(of mostly non-unionized workers) due to efficiencies in its </p><p>plastic bottling line.  Mariposa executives refuse to meet </p><p>with FESTRAS (but have met with Mariposa\'s own (weak) union) </p><p>and believe a conspiracy exists to discredit Mariposa </p><p>supported by Coke and the local beer monopoly, which is </p><p>resisting Mariposa\'s diversification into beer production. </p><p>17.  (U) Employment Figures:  Newly-released survey data from </p><p>the National Institute of Statistics from May-June 2002 shows </p><p>that of the population aged 10 and above (8,089,785), 59% are </p><p>employed, 10% are unemployed, and 9.1% are under-employed. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (U) Failing Banks and Labor Strife:  Reynaldo Gonzalez, </p><p>Secretary General of the Bank Workers Union (FESEBS) and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>leaders of union of workers of the National Mortgage Bank </p><p>told LabAtt on March 11 that despite reinstallation orders </p><p>from the courts, bank management has refused to reinstate two </p><p>illegally-fired workers.  Bank lawyers are fighting similar </p><p>legal petitions for 150 others who were illegally fired, </p><p>according to the union.  Union members believe the illegal </p><p>firings under the guise of streamlining (CHN is absorbing </p><p>other failing banks) are intended to reduce union membership. </p><p> This case is one of those highlighted in the AFL-CIO GSP </p><p>petition. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
