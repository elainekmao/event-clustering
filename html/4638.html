Despite the progress, many questions </p><p>remain about the exact nature of any federal-type </p><p>solution.  Overall, in the wake of the recent talks and </p><p>the Oslo donors\' conference, the peace process seems </p><p>stronger than ever as it moves toward its one-year </p><p>anniversary.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>============================ </p><p>LTTE Shift toward Federalism </p><p>============================ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The just-concluded third session of talks in Oslo </p><p>helped the peace process pick up significant new </p><p>traction.  (Note:  The talks took place December 2-5. </p><p>The Norwegian government\'s press communique reviewing </p><p>the results of the talks is contained in Ref A.  The </p><p>next session of talks is scheduled for January 6-9, </p><p>2003.)  In particular, the LTTE\'s agreement to explore </p><p>the possible creation of a federal system within a </p><p>united Sri Lanka as a potential solution to the conflict </p><p>was a key shift by the group.  While the LTTE has been </p><p>shying away from outright separatism in its public </p><p>statements of late, this was the first time the LTTE has </p><p>ever explicitly accepted the notion that it could work </p><p>within a united Sri Lanka.  (Note:  According to </p><p>Minister Milinda Moragoda, the LTTE proposed the </p><p>federalism language on its own volition.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In judging the significance of the understanding </p><p>on this issue, it is noteworthy that the LTTE\'s prior </p><p>definitions of "Tamil Eelam" seemed to preclude any form </p><p>of subordination by a Tamil (read LTTE)-controlled </p><p>north/east unit to the government in Colombo.  In </p><p>agreeing to examine federalism, however, the Tigers not </p><p>only seem to be rejecting separatism, but also </p><p>confederation, i.e., the setting up of a parallel </p><p>administration in the north and east equal in status to </p><p>Colombo.  In fact, just this last April, LTTE negotiator </p><p>Anton Balasingham indicated that he considered LTTE </p><p>leader V. Prabhakaran as "prime minister" for LTTE- </p><p>controlled areas with PM Wickremesinghe in charge of the </p><p>south.  The LTTE now seems to be indicating that it </p><p>might be able to accept subordination to the GSL\'s </p><p>president, prime minister, and parliament, in return for </p><p>some form of autonomy.  It is not even close to being </p><p>agreed to yet (see paras 5-7 for more on potential </p><p>problem areas), but the LTTE effectively appears to be </p><p>indicating that a governor or something similar (as </p><p>opposed to a LTTE-selected "president" or "PM") could </p><p>head up a north/east unit. </p><p> </p><p>================================ </p><p>Key Confidence-Building Measures </p><p>================================ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In addition to the understanding re federalism, </p><p>the two sides\' agreement to numerous confidence-building </p><p>measures was also noteworthy.  The following </p><p>understandings, encapsulated in the press communique, </p><p>stood out in potential importance: </p><p> </p><p>-- LTTE/Other Parties:  The LTTE agreed to accept the </p><p>right of other political groups to carry out political </p><p>activities.  In mentioning this agreement, the </p><p>communique made specific reference to the right of other </p><p>parties to carry out political work in Jaffna District </p><p>and its islands.  (Note:  This issue came up because the </p><p>LTTE, amid some violence, has been engaged in trying to </p><p>prevent other Tamil parties from political work in the </p><p>islands off Jaffna in recent weeks.) </p><p> </p><p>-- LTTE "Legal" System:  The LTTE agreed that its "law </p><p>and order mechanisms" will not be extended beyond areas </p><p>already under the group\'s control.  (Note:  Before the </p><p>Oslo talks began, the government promised to raise the </p><p>issue of the recent expansion of the LTTE\'s "court" </p><p>system.  In agreeing to this language, the LTTE </p><p>indicated that it would stop imposing its "legal" system </p><p>on Tamils living in GSL-controlled sectors of the north </p><p>and east.  The agreed language seems to permit the LTTE </p><p>to continue imposing its "legal" system on Tamils living </p><p>in areas under the group\'s control, however.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Movement of LTTE Commanders:  The LTTE agreed that </p><p>the group would allow the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM) to supervise the transport and </p><p>movement of LTTE commanders between sectors. </p><p>(Note:  Reacting to GSL complaints, the SLMM has been </p><p>urging the LTTE to ensure that its commanders work with </p><p>the monitoring group on all significant movements, per </p><p>the February ceasefire accord.  There have been several </p><p>cases where LTTE commanders have moved from the northern </p><p>sector to the east and vice versa without notifying the </p><p>SLMM.) </p><p> </p><p>-- LTTE and Children:  The parties agreed that children </p><p>should not be involved in political or military </p><p>activities.  The LTTE also agreed to work with UNICEF to </p><p>draw up an "action plan" in this area.  (Note:  The LTTE </p><p>has made many promises of this sort in the past.  By </p><p>most accounts, the LTTE remains engaged in forcibly </p><p>recruiting children into its political/military system.) </p><p> </p><p>======================= </p><p>Questions re Federalism </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Despite all of the significant progress made at </p><p>Oslo, much work is still needed on many issues involving </p><p>federalism.  The concept itself is potentially quite </p><p>controversial in Sri Lanka.  It is still not fully clear </p><p>whether Sinhalese chauvinists in the south will in fact </p><p>come to accept the notion of a federal system.  For </p><p>decades, pro-Sinhalese elements have demanded that the </p><p>country remain totally "unitary," i.e., no devolution of </p><p>authority, no regional autonomy, etc.  Indeed, to </p><p>suggest that Sri Lanka be anything less than a unitary </p><p>state was seen almost as traitorous behavior and an </p><p>infringement on Sri Lanka\'s putative identity as a </p><p>Sinhalese Buddhist nation.  Through the years, there has </p><p>been some modification in the intensity in which such </p><p>views are held, but the anti-federalism streak has </p><p>remained noticeable.  (Note:  In fact, it has been one </p><p>of those perennial "third rail" issues mentioned below.) </p><p>Given the potential for controversy over the issue, the </p><p>exact parameters of any federal solution will require </p><p>much negotiation, as well as great care in selling any </p><p>understandings -- including possible constitutional </p><p>proposals -- to the Sinhalese south.  (Note:  In a press </p><p>conference held after the conclusion of the talks on </p><p>December 5, government and LTTE negotiators indicated </p><p>that constitutional changes, perhaps even a new </p><p>constitution, would be necessary -- see Ref A.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) One of the areas involving federalism that need </p><p>further refinement concerns exactly to whom it might </p><p>apply to.  According to the communique of the Oslo </p><p>talks, the two sides agreed that federalism would be </p><p>founded on "internal self-determination in areas of </p><p>historical habitation of the Tamil-speaking people." </p><p>The phrase "Tamil-speaking people" has proved </p><p>controversial in the past.  A similar phrase was used in </p><p>the 1987 Indo-Sri Lankan peace accord and it was not </p><p>clear at that time to which communities the phrase </p><p>applied.  In Sri Lanka, for example, at least three </p><p>distinct communities speak Tamil:  Tamils in the north </p><p>and east; tea estate Tamils in the central highlands; </p><p>and Muslims.  It is this last community, the Muslims </p><p>(and especially those in the east), that is bound to be </p><p>most worried about any "federal" solution being applied </p><p>to them.  (Note:  Muslims in the east bitterly resent </p><p>the LTTE and are fearful of coming under the group\'s </p><p>control, given the LTTE\'s long-standing claim that all </p><p>of the east should be under Tamil domination.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Another area that needs further definition is the </p><p>precise scope of a possible federal model and its </p><p>application to Sri Lanka\'s domestic scene.  Would it </p><p>apply to the center\'s relations with other areas, too?, </p><p>i.e., would it be "symmetric" devolution? or would it be </p><p>"asymmetric" devolution (applying to only the north and </p><p>east)?   These issues have to be answered because it is </p><p>possible that other regions of Sri Lanka might seek </p><p>autonomous rights. </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) In the wake of the recent talks and the Oslo </p><p>donors\' conference before that, the peace process seems </p><p>stronger than ever as it moves toward its one-year </p><p>anniversary.  (Note:  The peace process started with the </p><p>LTTE and GSL joining in unilateral ceasefires beginning </p><p>December 24, 2001.)  Thus far, the process seems to have </p><p>survived numerous "third rails" of Sri Lankan politics, </p><p>which were supposed to knock it permanently off course. </p><p>The GSL\'s legalization of the LTTE in September, for </p><p>example, was supposed to lead to mass protests by </p><p>Sinhalese chauvinists, but, in actuality, little </p><p>happened.  At the same time, the introduction of the </p><p>word "federalism" into the negotiations was supposed to </p><p>ignite problems in the south -- so far, however, there </p><p>has been little reaction.  There could still be problems </p><p>over many issues, but the peace process seems to be </p><p>maintaining immense public support at this time.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
