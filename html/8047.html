<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 003157 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PRM, E, EB, EUR/SE, NEA/NGA, AND IO </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ETTC, PREL, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: USG CONTRACTOR BEGINS TO EXPORT TURKISH LPG AND </p><p>GASOLINE TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 2915 B) KUWAIT 1825 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  U.S. military contractor Kellogg, Brown, </p><p>and Root (KBR) has successfully delivered its first shipment </p><p>of Turkish Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) and gasoline from </p><p>Turkey to Iraq, which will be donated as humanitarian </p><p>assistance to Iraqi civilians.  The U.S. military has </p><p>contracted KBR to purchase and transport approximately 700 </p><p>metric tons of LPG and one million gallons of benzine to Iraq </p><p>daily, seven days per week, for at least four weeks.  The GOT </p><p>has thus far facilitated the purchase and transport of this </p><p>fuel, which should bring at least USD 40 million to the </p><p>Turkish economy.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) After receiving a task order from Task Force Restore </p><p>Iraqi Oil (TF Rio) o/a May 7, U.S. military contractor </p><p>Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) began arrangements to export </p><p>Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) and benzine (gasoline) from Turkey </p><p>to Northern Iraq (ref A).  The task order authorizes KBR to </p><p>purchase LPG and gasoline commercially in Turkey and </p><p>transport it into Iraq to be donated as humanitarian </p><p>assistance to Iraqi civilians through TF Rio.  KBR expects to </p><p>purchase and transport approximately 700 metric tons of LPG </p><p>and one million gallons of benzine to Iraq daily, seven days </p><p>per week, for at least four weeks.  (Note:  We understand </p><p>that TF Rio is likely to increase these quantities and the </p><p>duration of the operation.  End note.)  Embassy requested and </p><p>received from the Turkish MFA assurances that the GOT would </p><p>take steps to expedite the purchase and transport of this </p><p>humanitarian assistance to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The contractor estimates that exporting this amount </p><p>of LPG and benzine will require approximately 240 trucks per </p><p>day -- 40 trucks for the LPG, and 200 trucks for the benzine. </p><p> Although KBR expects it will take at least a week to arrange </p><p>daily export of these quantities, it launched a successful </p><p>trial run over the past three days.  From May 10 to May 12, </p><p>93 trucks passed through Harbur Gate into Iraq:  54 trucks </p><p>carrying approximately 300,000 gallons of benzine, and 39 </p><p>trucks carrying approximately 800 metric tons of LPG.  We </p><p>understand there have been delays in loading the trucks in </p><p>Turkey as well as off-loading in Iraq, but it appears these </p><p>delays are part of the normal learning curve associated with </p><p>staging an operation of this size. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The embassy issued a press release May 10 announcing </p><p>that the first convoy carrying humanitarian assistance LPG </p><p>and gasoline had crossed into Iraq from Turkey.  The press </p><p>release notes that Turkey is cooperating with the U.S. in </p><p>providing this HA to the people of Iraq by facilitating the </p><p>passage of the vehicles.  It also notes that the U.S. is </p><p>purchasing and transporting this fuel using Turkish firms, </p><p>and estimates the U.S. government will spend nearly USD 40 </p><p>million in Turkey in the first month of this operation. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
