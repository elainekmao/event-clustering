(C)  AT MEDIA THEMED LUNCH HOSTED BY AMBASSADOR </p><p>NICHOLSON, DIRECTOR OF MEDIA FOR THE CONGREGATION FOR THE </p><p>PROPAGATION OF THE FAITH (FIDES), FATHER BENARDO </p><p>CERVELLERA, SPOKE AT LENGTH ON HIS VIEWS OF RECENT </p><p>VATICAN/PRC DEVELOPMENTS.  CERVELLERA SAID THAT ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE POPE\'S 10/24 STATEMENT APOLOGIZING TO THE CHINESE </p><p>PEOPLE FOR THE "MISTAKES\' MADE BY EARLY CHRISTIAN </p><p>MISSIONARIES AND FOR A RESUMPTION OF DIALOG BETWEEN THE </p><p>PRC AND THE HOLY SEE WAS WELL RECEIVED BY THE CHINESE </p><p>PEOPLE, IT "FELL ON DEAF EARS" WITHIN THE CHINESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE SEES THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF ANY RESUMPTION OF DIALOG BETWEEN CHINA AND </p><p>THE HOLY SEE AIMED AT NORMALIZING RELATIONS BEFORE </p><p>ELECTIONS THE MARCH ELECTIONS IN CHINA TO BE NIL. (NOTE: </p><p>WE HEARD THE SAME FROM OUR TAIWAN EMBASSY CONTACTS). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  CERVELLERA ALSO DISCUSSED THE ROLE OF THE </p><p>"OFFICIAL" CHURCH AND THE UNDERGROUND CHURCH IN CHINA. </p><p>HE BELIEVES 80 PERCENT OF THE "OFFICIAL" CHURCH IS LOYAL </p><p>TO THE POPE.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE REMAINING "OLD </p><p>LINERS" IN THE "OFFICIAL" CHURCH ARE DYING OFF.  IN </p><p>EFFECT, THERE IS NO LONGER EVEN A DE FACTO SCHISM BETWEEN </p><p>THE VATICAN AND CHINESE CATHOLICISM.   THE ONLY PROBLEM </p><p>IS THE "PATRIOTIC ASSOCIATION" WHICH BEIJING USES TO </p><p>CONTROL THE ACTIVITIES OF THE "OFFICIAL" CHURCH. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05814  091331Z </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  COMMENT:  CERVELLERA AND FIDES ARE STRONGLY </p><p>IDENTIFIED WITH THE FACTION IN THE VATICAN WHICH OPPOSES </p><p>NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH CHINA UNTIL THE COMMUNISM </p><p>ARE REMOVED.  THAT SAID, HIS BELIEF THAT THERE WON\'T BE </p><p>ANY MOVEMENT UNTIL AFTER MARCH IS SHARED EVEN BY THOSE </p><p>WHO WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF QUICK RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOG </p><p>(REF).  CERVELLERA\'S VIEWS ON THE "OFFICIAL" CHURCH ARE </p><p>QUITE PROGRESSIVE AND APPEAR TO REFLECT THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>ATTEMPT TO FULLY HEAL THE RIFT BETWEEN THE UNDERGROUND </p><p>CHURCH AND THE "OFFICIAL CHURCH" EVEN BEFORE THERE IS A </p><p>POLITICAL DIALOG WITH BEIJING. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA05814 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
