<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 TEGUCIGALPA 002444 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PPC, WHA/CEN, EB/TRA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 08/28/12 </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, MARR, PREL, ECON, ECIN, HO </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOTO CANO AIRBASE TO BECOME COMMERCIAL AIRPORT? </p><p> </p><p>Classified by PolChief Francisco Palmieri, Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary:  On August 15, President Maduro </p><p>announced his intention to convert the Soto Cano military </p><p>airstrip into an international airport for commercial </p><p>use.  The Comayagua business community embraces the </p><p>concept, which seeks to transform the area into a new </p><p>commercial center with an eye toward bolstering a </p><p>flailing economy.  Maduro reiterated that the airstrip </p><p>will continue to be used for military purposes and </p><p>suggested that U.S. authorities have already agreed to </p><p>the conversion--although no one at the Embassy has </p><p>discussed the matter with the Administration. At a </p><p>Comayagua Chamber of Commerce forum, Minister of </p><p>Government and Justice Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro and </p><p>President of Congress Pepe Lobo extolled the benefits of </p><p>a conversion, giving this initiative high-level political </p><p>support.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>THE U.S. PRESENCE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Since 1982 the U.S. military has shared the </p><p>airbase at Soto Cano (commonly known by Hondurans as </p><p>Palmerola--the name of the town previously located on the </p><p>site) with the Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF).  Currently, </p><p>Joint Task Force Bravo (JTF-Bravo) is the guest of the </p><p>HOAF on the base; houses more than 600 U.S. troops; and </p><p>employs more than 700 Hondurans.  Through salaries, </p><p>contracts, tourism and donations, JTF-Bravo contributes </p><p>approximately $17.5 million annually to the economy </p><p>(primarily in the Comayagua valley). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) JTF-Bravo\'s initial mission was to deter </p><p>Nicaraguan aggression--thereafter its duties included </p><p>regional counternarcotics, humanitarian and civic </p><p>assistance operations.  Recently, USCINCSO appointed JTF- </p><p>Bravo as the central coordinating authority for U.S. </p><p>military operating within the region--including Honduras, </p><p>Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and </p><p>Panama.  JTF-Bravo conducts joint, combined and </p><p>interagency operations, and supports contingency </p><p>operations throughout the assigned area to enhance </p><p>theater-wide operational security and reinforce regional </p><p>military cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) JTF-Bravo is the first responder to crises in </p><p>the region, and it conducts operations in support of </p><p>counternarcotics and counterterrorism missions. </p><p>Moreover, it conducts and supports recovery and </p><p>evacuation operations in Central America (CENTAM). </p><p>Additionally, the task force is charged with providing a </p><p>C-5 capable airfield (the only one of its kind in </p><p>Honduras), base support for joint combined exercises and </p><p>unit training, theater deployable surgical team, all- </p><p>source intelligence, operational footprint for immediate </p><p>reaction forces, and maintains pre-positioned stocks for </p><p>theater-wide military operations.  Secondarily, JTF-Bravo </p><p>conducts and supports humanitarian civic assistance and </p><p>military civic action operations, supports USAID and </p><p>provides base support for joint combined exercise </p><p>training, exercises, and unit training. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>CONVERSION IN THE OFFING? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) In mid-August, President Maduro announced that he </p><p>is considering the conversion of the airstrip at Soto </p><p>Cano, enabling the facility to be used by commercial </p><p>airlines.  He was careful to make clear that the airstrip </p><p>would continue to be used for military operations. (Note: </p><p>Since the HOAF shares the base with the U.S. military, </p><p>the airstrip is also used by the HOAF. End Note.)  Maduro </p><p>indicated that he wants an airport for the city of </p><p>Comayagua (the one-time capital of Honduras, adjacent to </p><p>Soto Cano) in order to strengthen the economy of the </p><p>Comayagua valley and create a new center for commercial </p><p>activity in Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Maduro emphasized that if commercially available, </p><p>the airport could be extensively used for carrying cargo </p><p>for exportation--including mangos and other </p><p>produce(especially oriental vegetables, which require </p><p>special handling), tilapia, and cleaning products </p><p>produced in the area.  Moreover, he opined that </p><p>commercialization of the facility would increase the </p><p>potential for industrial development in the region-- </p><p>including "maquilas," which are currently found primarily </p><p>in the San Pedro Sula area.  He also mentioned the </p><p>possibility of constructing a four-lane highway from </p><p>Comayagua to Puerto Cortes (on the north coast) and </p><p>between Tegucigalpa and Comayagua.  (Comment: A new </p><p>international airport in Comayagua and highway to the </p><p>capital could prompt U.S. air carriers to provide cargo </p><p>and passenger services in central Honduras.  Currently, </p><p>such service is restricted at Toncontin Airport in </p><p>Tegucigalpa due to limits on the size of planes that can </p><p>safely land there.  However, post notes that construction </p><p>of a four-lane highway between Comayagua and Tegucigalpa </p><p>is highly unlikely in the near future given the high cost </p><p>and technical difficulties of building such a road.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p>7.  (U) The Comayaguan business community strongly favors </p><p>the conversion of the base airport to accommodate </p><p>commercial flights.  The Comayagua Chamber of Commerce </p><p>and local authorities have developed specific plans for </p><p>such a conversion at Soto Cano. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>SUFFICIENT POLITICAL SUPPORT? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) On August 22, the Comayagua Chamber of Commerce </p><p>hosted a forum in which the potential airport project was </p><p>discussed by local authorities and business people.  Both </p><p>Minister of Government and Justice Jorge Ramon Hernandez </p><p>Alcerro and President of Congress Porfirio "Pepe" Lobo </p><p>Sosa attended the event and expressed support for the </p><p>project.  Hernandez Alcerro described the project as the </p><p>realization of a vision for the future first conceived by </p><p>the Spanish conquistadors.  He suggested that the region </p><p>is a natural commercial center due to both geography and </p><p>local economic interests.  He pointed out that the </p><p>project would complement the Plan Puebla-Panama regional </p><p>economic integration and would further the goal of </p><p>uniting the region with a "backbone" for commercial </p><p>transportation.  (Comment:  The public support of high- </p><p>level, powerful political figures such as Hernandez </p><p>Alcerro and Lobo is indicative of the robust backing that </p><p>exists for the creation of a new international airport, </p><p>either in Comayagua or closer to Tegucigalpa.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Lobo said that he had no doubt that such a </p><p>project would be a success.  Lobo stated that he is </p><p>confident that the natural resources, the climate and the </p><p>infrastructure of the Comayagua valley are conducive to </p><p>the success of a commercial airport component at </p><p>Palmerola.  Additionally, he pointed out that it would </p><p>contribute to decentralization(a goal of Maduro), which </p><p>would relieve Tegucigalpa\'s problems with water shortages </p><p>and unmanageable population growth.  Lobo pledged that </p><p>Congress would consider the project proposal and do </p><p>whatever is necessary to achieve the project objectives. </p><p>The Comayagua Chamber of Commerce is seeking a meeting </p><p>with President Maduro in the near future in order to </p><p>pursue the airport issue in depth. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) It is difficult to say what the ramifications of </p><p>a commercial airport would be to JTF-Bravo.  The initial </p><p>readout of Post staff is that such a conversion would </p><p>probably have little effect on the U.S. military presence </p><p>at Soto Cano.  In fact, an expansion of the runway </p><p>facilities could benefit JTF-Bravo by making it possible </p><p>for larger, fixed-wing aircraft to use the airbase.  All </p><p>parties involved recognize that the U.S. military is </p><p>present at the invitation of the Honduran government, and </p><p>it is yet to be determined whether or not the U.S. </p><p>Department of Defense would have any objections to the </p><p>commercialization of the base airport. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Presumably, a commercial terminal would be built </p><p>separate and apart from the military facilities. </p><p>Moreover, any such project would need to include careful </p><p>planning in order to not impede the military functions </p><p>that must be carried out at Soto Cano--both U.S. and </p><p>Honduran.  A variety of security and safety issues would </p><p>be raised, including the appropriate level of air traffic </p><p>control that would be needed.  Additionally, a combined </p><p>military-civilian airport raises security concerns and </p><p>costs--particularly in light of heightened worldwide </p><p>airport security that has been implemented since </p><p>September 11. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Finally, there remain internal political issues </p><p>to be sorted out--including longstanding competition </p><p>between Tegucigalpa and Comayagua.  Powerful business </p><p>interests in Tegucigalpa have not yet weighed in on the </p><p>issue publicly, and there is a heavyweight political </p><p>presence in the capital city and in San Pedro Sula that </p><p>can be expected to vehemently oppose shifting commercial </p><p>power to the Comayagua valley.  Tegucigalpa Mayor Miguel </p><p>Pastor has already announced his opposition to the plan. </p><p>Post anticipates that domestic political and commercial </p><p>competition will affect the manner in which Maduro\'s </p><p>airport plans proceed. </p><p> </p><p>ALMAGUER </p><p></p></div>
