<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002997 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBED, EB/ESC, EUR/SE </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, AJ, GG, KZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: BTC CO LIFTS MATERIAL BREACH CLAIM </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2459 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Couns Scot Marciel, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  BTC Co has formally informed the GOT that </p><p>the government is no longer in material breach of its </p><p>obligations under the BTC agreements (reftel).  BTC Co CEO </p><p>Michael Townshend told us he is satisfied that the GOT has </p><p>resolved all outstanding operational issues, a point he </p><p>reiterated with Energy Minister Guler in a joint press </p><p>conference May 7.  Of course we will need to observe how the </p><p>BOTAS team manages in practice; in a project of this size new </p><p>challenges are sure to emerge.  For today, however, the news </p><p>on BTC from Turkey is nothing but good.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BTC Co Chief Executive Officer Michael Townshend told </p><p>econoff May 7 that he is "as satisfied as he could be" that </p><p>the GOT has resolved the outstanding operational issues </p><p>raised in BTC Co\'s April 7 "material breach" letter (reftel). </p><p> Townshend said the GOT had addressed the BOTAS management </p><p>issues by appointing the new BOTAS General Manager, Mehmet </p><p>Bilgic, and the new BTC Directorate Chief, Dogan Sirikci. </p><p>Townshend said he had known Sirikci for 10 years and was </p><p>satisfied that he could do the job.  In addition, Townshend </p><p>said, Energy Minister Guler had confirmed the BOTAS Board had </p><p>given Sirikci increased management authority to allow him to </p><p>implement fully the BTC turnkey contract, including the </p><p>authority to make financial decisions up to USD 10 million in </p><p>value, organizational changes, and certain contracting </p><p>decisions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As BTC Co had requested, Minister Guler responded to </p><p>the material breach letter with a formal letter, dated May 7, </p><p>that outlines the above changes.  Guler\'s letter also </p><p>addresses several other outstanding issues not included in </p><p>the material breach letter, including resolution of a dispute </p><p>over how the fuel tax will be applied to BTC Co and an </p><p>indication that the current "investigations" of the project </p><p>will be terminated (reftel).  The letter also advises that </p><p>the Ministry will implement an action plan to ensure timely </p><p>gas supply to BTC\'s Pump Station I. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Townshend delivered a written response to Minister </p><p>Guler\'s May 7 letter the same day, stating that, "In </p><p>consideration of the actions taken by the Turkish Government, </p><p>we are pleased to advise we now consider the right conditions </p><p>are in place for BOTAS to effectively manage the works to </p><p>completion and as of today are lifting our claim of material </p><p>breach." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Minister Guler and Townshend held a joint press </p><p>conference May 7, where Townshend emphasized BP\'s continued </p><p>support for the Caspian region and the BTC project.  He said </p><p>he was very pleased with the progress made on BOTAS </p><p>management issues, and was convinced the project would be </p><p>completed on time.  Townshend also praised BOTAS, saying the </p><p>company should be proud of its success to bringing BTC to its </p><p>current development stage.  (We have emailed the text of the </p><p>press release to E/CBED and EUR/SE). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  All in all, a very good day for BTC.  The </p><p>GOT has responded to BTC Co\'s immediate "material breach" </p><p>concerns and more.  The BOTAS management team is close to </p><p>Minister Guler and has sufficient authority to complete the </p><p>project.  There will be more challenges, and we will need to </p><p>monitor how the team manages in practice.  But, for now at </p><p>least, it seems the AK government has got it right on BTC. </p><p>End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
