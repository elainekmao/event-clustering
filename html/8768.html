Dailies mention an `open </p><p>letter\' issued by reformist politicians, clerics, opposition </p><p>groups, intellectuals, and journalists in defense of the </p><p>Iranian people\'s right to criticize and even bring down the </p><p>Iranian administration.  President Bush has seized the </p><p>opportunity to challenge the rulers of Iran, and voiced </p><p>support for the protestors, saying that `people are </p><p>expressing views for a free Iran, which is a positive </p><p>development.\'  Reports also quote Ari Fleischer as </p><p>denouncing attacks by a militia loyal to Iran\'s spiritual </p><p>leader Hamanei against the students. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MFA U/S in U.S.: MFA U/S Ambassador Ugur Ziyal and his </p><p>delegation are scheduled to meet with Grossman, Wolfowitz, </p><p>Larson, Burns and some Congressmen in Washington before </p><p>returning on Thursday.  Dailies regard the visit as an </p><p>effort to `repair the damage\' in U.S.-Turkey ties.  Ankara </p><p>and Washington will discuss the future of the bilateral </p><p>strategic relationship, and will also focus on Iran and </p><p>Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PM Erdogan in Pakistan: The first Turkish Prime Minister to </p><p>visit Pakistan in the last five years, Erdogan and his </p><p>Pakistani counterpart have decided to hold annual bilateral </p><p>meetings to boost ties.  In a joint press conference with </p><p>his counterpart Prime Minister Jemali, Erdogan called for </p><p>Pakistani participation in peacekeeping activities in Iraq. </p><p>Erdogan, who is scheduled to meet with Pakistani head of </p><p>state Musharraf on Monday, is expected to call for </p><p>membership of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) </p><p>in the Organization for Islamic Conference (OIC).  Papers </p><p>say that Turkey and Pakistan will sign agreements on ground </p><p>transportation, environmental protection, and the struggle </p><p>against drug trafficking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey, EU: On the eve of critical parliamentary discussions </p><p>on the EU reform package this week, Foreign Minister Gul </p><p>said that if Turkey manages to pass necessary reforms in the </p><p>next two months, accession negotiations with the EU could </p><p>begin in 2004.  This would pave the way for Turkey\'s EU </p><p>membership by 2010.  Dailies expect no drastic change in </p><p>Turkey-EU relations at the upcoming EU summit in </p><p>Thessaloniki, Greece this weekend.  The Thessaloniki summit </p><p>will call on Ankara and the Turkish Cypriots to support the </p><p>UN-sponsored peace plan for Cyprus. </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Middle East </p><p>b) Iran and US-Turkish relations </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"New era in the Middle East" </p><p>Yasemin Congar observed in mass appeal Milliyet (6/16): "It </p><p>may sound like a distant dream, yet there are some positive </p><p>developments in the Middle East.  The first good sign comes </p><p>with the reaffirmation of the US commitment to the roadmap. </p><p>Secretary Powell\'s message that `we will not give up, we </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>will not stumble\' should be taken as a very important </p><p>declaration. . There are also some positive things happening </p><p>in the Israel-Palestine dialogue. Most importantly, the </p><p>channel for dialogue remains open despite the negative </p><p>developments on the ground. . The third good sign comes from </p><p>Europe and regional countries, which have signaled their </p><p>active participation in the process.  They all consider </p><p>themselves part of the Middle East initiative. . As for </p><p>Ankara, these developments should be read correctly, and </p><p>Turkey should not remain an observer.  Ankara must give a </p><p>hand to Palestinian PM Abbas.  Turkey is capable of </p><p>accelerating the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue through clever </p><p>diplomacy." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ziyal\'s visit" </p><p>Asli Aydintasbas wrote in mass appeal Sabah (6/16): "The </p><p>visit of Turkish MFA U/S Ziyal to Washington is basically an </p><p>effort to repair the bilateral relationship.  He will convey </p><p>messages from Ankara and listen to what US officials have to </p><p>say. . In fact, there are enough signs already about what </p><p>Ziyal will be hearing from the US.  Richard Perle of the AEI </p><p>recently revealed that message.  Perle highlighted the </p><p>Iranian nuclear program and regime\'s link with terrorism, </p><p>and hinted that the repair of Turkish-American ties goes </p><p>through US-Turkish cooperation on Iran. . `Ankara should </p><p>have a very clear stance about Iran\' says an American </p><p>official.  Washington wants to know whether Turkey will be </p><p>on the US side in a possible campaign against Iran." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
