<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 000945 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR G/TIP, INL, DRL, NEA/RA AND NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 2/26/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PHUM, ECON, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: LABOUR MINISTRY ACKNOWLEDGES WIDESPREAD ABUSE OF </p><p>"FREE VISA" SCHEME </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABU DHABI 47 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Despite ongoing efforts by the Ministry of Labour and </p><p>Social Affairs to stiffen immigration regulations and </p><p>curtail the influx of laborers entering the UAE under false </p><p>pretenses, Ministry officials have told the local press that </p><p>as many as 600,000 workers -- 27% of the UAE\'s total labor </p><p>force -- entered the country under false work contracts over </p><p>the last few years. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The work visas are obtained by UAE businesses from </p><p>the Ministry of Labor for a specific economic activity, but </p><p>often the alleged jobs are purely fictitious.  Arriving </p><p>expatriate workers, often unaware of this situation, are </p><p>told by their erstwhile Emirati employers that they must go </p><p>out and find their own jobs -- and usually kick-back ten </p><p>percent or more of their income to their nominal </p><p>employers/sponsors -- or risk deportation.  So prevalent is </p><p>this phenomenon, often referred to as the "free visa" </p><p>scheme, that Ministry officials estimate that only 49% of </p><p>the registered businesses in the country are legitimate -- </p><p>the other 51% exist only to sell visas. Last year the Labour </p><p>Ministry issued 260,000 employment visas. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Though the UAEG has recently implemented a </p><p>high-profile amnesty program to encourage illegal workers to </p><p>leave the country (see reftel), this new report demonstrates </p><p>the extent of the problem and the difficulties confronting </p><p>the authorities in reforming the UAE labor market.  The </p><p>principal difficulty facing the Labour Ministry is that many </p><p>Emiratis, particularly from the poorer northern Emirates, </p><p>derive significant income from the exploitation of the </p><p>visa/sponsorship process -- and the expatriate workers who </p><p>are subject to it.  A strong regional political </p><p>constituency, therefore, exists for maintaining the status </p><p>quo -- which may help explain why the federal Labour </p><p>Ministry is so willing to go public with these rather </p><p>alarming figures. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
