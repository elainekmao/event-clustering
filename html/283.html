<p>S E C R E T BAGHDAD 03048 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PARM PREL UR, IR IZ </p><p>SUBJ:  SOVIET ARMS SALES TO IRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 176500 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S-ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  AMBASSADOR CALLED ON MFA UNDERSECRETARY HAMDUN </p><p>ON JUNE 5 TO RESUME DIALOGUE ON THE PROBLEM OF </p><p>SOVIET ARMS SALES TO IRAN.  POINTING OUT THAT </p><p>REFTEL HAD BEEN DRAFTED PRIOR TO THE NEWS OF </p><p>KHOMEINI\'S DEATH, AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT WHATEVER </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY EMERGE IN TEHRAN, </p><p>FOR THE MOMENT  WE HAVE A RAFSANJANI VISIT SCHEDULED </p><p>FOR MOSCOW JUNE  21.  WE ARE URGING GULF CAPITALS </p><p>TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO REGISTER WITH THE SOVIETS </p><p>CLEARLY THAT THERE WILL BE STRONG NEGATIVE ARAB </p><p>REACTION TO RESUMPTION OF ARMS DELIVERIES TO IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AMBASSADOR THEN WENT THROUGH TICKS IN PARA FOUR </p><p>REFTEL, REITERATING THAT WE WERE GRATEFUL FOR THE </p><p>IRAQIS CONTINUING TO SHARE WITH US THEIR THOUGHTS </p><p>AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ISSUE OF GRAVE MUTUAL </p><p>CONCERN TO BOTH OF OUR GOVERNMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  HAMDUN RESPONDED THAT HE DID HAVE SOMETHING TO </p><p>REPORT.  FOR THE FIRST TIME  THE SOVIETS HAVE </p><p>ADMITTED TO THE GOI THAT THEY DO INTEND TO SELLARMS, </p><p>THOUGH REFUSING TO GIVE ANY SPECIFICS.  THEY CLAIM </p><p>THEY WOULD NOT GIVE IRAN    EVERYTHING IT ASKED FOR </p><p>AND THAT THE ARMS PACKAGE WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO TIP </p><p>THE REGIONAL BALANCE.  THE SOVIETS\' JUSTIFICATION </p><p>TO THE IRAQIS WAS SIMPLE -- IF MOSCOW DOES NOT SELL </p><p>THE ARMS THE WEST WILL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FOR ITS PART, HAMDUN SAID, IRAQ CONTINUES TO </p><p>MAKE ITS POSITION CLEAR TO THE SOVIETS, AND HAS </p><p>ASKED KUWAIT, YAR, JORDAN, AND EGYPT, </p><p>TO DO SO AS WELL.  WITH REGARD TO THE GULF, </p><p>HOWEVER, HAMDUN EMPHASIZED, THE SOVIETS ARE </p><p>PROBABLY PLAYING ON A SECOND TRACK.  IRAQ BELIEVES </p><p>MOSCOW IS TRYING TO SET UP AN "AXIS" TO INCLUDE </p><p>THE KABUL REGIME, IRAN, AND THE IRANIAN BASED </p><p>MUJAHIDIN: I.E. THEY ARE SEEKING ANY </p><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR ARMS SALES TO TEHRAN WHICH WILL </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME HELP THEIR POSITION IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  EVIDENCE FOR THIS HYPOTHESIS </p><p>HAD COME FROM REPORTED REMARKS BY THE SOVIET </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE UAE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACTION RECOMMENDED:  AMBASSADOR ASKED WHAT </p><p>HAMDUN RECOMMENDED BOTH OUR GOVERNMENTS COULD </p><p>OR SHOULD DO NEXT.  HE SUGGESTED WE BOTH MAKE AN </p><p>APPROACH NOW, ALONG THE LINES OF REFTEL, TO THE </p><p>EGYPTIANS.  AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THIS WAS A </p><p>SENSIBLE COURSE OF ACTION AND SAID SHE   WOULD </p><p>CONVEY THIS PROPOSAL IMMEDIATELY TO THE DEPARTMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
