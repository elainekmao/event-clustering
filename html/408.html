<p>UNCLAS KHARTOUM 11358 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR BREELAND </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  SUDAN:  1990 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 355397, B) KHARTOUM 7788, C) KHARTOUM 11253 </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE 1990 TERRORISM REPORT FOR SUDAN IS AS FOLLOWS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE ACROPOLE TERRORIST BOMBING CASE WENT THROUGH A </p><p>SERIES OF POSTPONEMENTS, WITH THE NEXT HEARING NOW </p><p>SCHEDULED FOR JAN. 22, 1991 (REF C).  MANY OF THE </p><p>POSTPONEMENTS, INCLUDING THE MOST RECENT ONE, INVOLVED </p><p>CONSULATIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE VICTIMS\' </p><p>FAMILIES.  THE FAMILIES SUBMITTED STATEMENTS DURING THE </p><p>YEAR INDICATING WHETHER THEY WOULD PARDON THE TERRORISTS, </p><p>WITH OR WITHOUT COMPENSATION ("DIYYA"), AS WELL AS THE </p><p>AMOUNT OF DIYYA DEMANDED.  THE COURT ANNOUNCED IN 1989 </p><p>THAT IF ANY FAMILY REFUSED TO PARDON THE TERRORISTS, THEY </p><p>WOULD BE EXECUTED.  SOME COMMENTS BY LEGAL AUTHORITIES IN </p><p>1990 SUGGESTED THAT LONG-TERM IMPRISONMENT OF THE </p><p>TERRORISTS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT </p><p>INCLUDED IN THE CHOICES MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE GOVERNMENT UNDERTOOK NO MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM </p><p>EFFORTS IN 1990. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE PLO CAMP NEAR SUDAN\'S RED SEA COAST, OCCUPIED </p><p>SINCE THE EVACUATION OF BEIRUT IN 1982, WAS REPORTEDLY </p><p>EVACUATED IN 1990 (REF B).  NO OTHER TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE CAMPS IN SUDAN. </p><p>SUDAN EXTENDS DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION TO THE PLO, WHICH </p><p>MAINTAINS AN EMBASSY IN KHARTOUM.  PLO CHIEF YASSER </p><p>ARAFAT VISITED SUDAN SEVERAL TIMES IN 1990. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE GOVERNMENT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 1990 IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING GOVERNMENT ON A </p><p>TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT A SPONSOR OF TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, IT HAS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAQ AND </p><p>INCREASING CONNECTIONS WITH IRAN.  IN 1990 THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>SIGNED AN "INTEGRATION AGREEMENT" WITH LIBYA.  AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT, COL. MUAMMAR QADHAFI VISITED </p><p>KHARTOUM IN OCTOBER.  THIS AGREEMENT PERMITS MUCH EASIER </p><p>ACCESS TO SUDAN BY LIBYANS.  SUDANESE AND NORTH KOREAN </p><p>OFFICIALS EXCHANGED VISITS DURING THE YEAR.  THE OUTBREAK </p><p>OF THE PERSIAN GULF CRISIS IN AUGUST PRODUCED MORE </p><p>INTENSIVE PAN-ARAB AND PAM ISLAMIC COMMENTARY IN THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA, CREATING A MORE RECEPTIVE </p><p>CLIMATE FOR ANTI-WESTERN ACTIONS IN SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
