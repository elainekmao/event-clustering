<p>UNCLASSIFIED ZAGREB  02881 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS ZAGREB 002881 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR A/S HOLBROOKE </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL OSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRESIDENT TUDJMAN RESPONDS TO AKASHI ON THE </p><p>          SIX POINTS FROM KNIN NEGOTIATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING IS THE HINA TRANSLATION OF PRESIDENT </p><p>TUDJMAN\'S RESPONSE TO THE SIX POINTS NEGOTIATED IN KNIN </p><p>BY UNPF YASUSHI AKASHI. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p>YOUR EXCELLENCY, IN RESPONSE TO YOUR FAX WHICH I </p><p>RECEIVED AT 9:30 PM TODAY ENCLOSING PROPOSALS BY THE </p><p>REBEL SERB LEADERSHIP IN KNIN, I STATE THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>1.  IT IS SURPRISING THAT YOU MAKE NO MENTION OF </p><p>UNCRO -- THE UNITED NATIONS\' PEACE KEEPING FORCES, </p><p>WHICH UNDER THAT NAME GOT THE MANDATE IN THE REPUBLIC </p><p>OF CROATIA BY A UN RESOLUTION, WHILE YOU MENTION THE </p><p>KNIN LEADERSHIP AND RSK; </p><p> </p><p>2.  WE FIND IT UNACCEPTABLE THAT UNCRO BE DEPLOYED ONLY </p><p>ALONG THE BORDER TOWARDS THE BIHAC POCKET.  OUR DEMAND </p><p>WAS AND STILL IS THAT UNCRO TAKE OVER THE CONTROL OF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BORDERS BETWEEN THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02881  311645Z </p><p>REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AND BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA, BUT AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AND SERBIA, </p><p>THAT IS, THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA.  THIS </p><p>REPRESENTS A BURNING ISSUE IN THE LIGHT OF NEW </p><p>DEPLOYMENT OF YUGOSLAV ARMY TROOPS AND EQUIPMENT ACROSS </p><p>THE DANUBE RIVER; </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ITEM NUMBER 2, WE REFUSE </p><p>THAT UN MILITARY OBSERVERS FOR BORDER CONTROL BE </p><p>DEPLOYED ONLY IN THE AREA OF MT. DINARA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  REBEL SERB LEADERS AGAIN WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE </p><p>OVER UN AND UNCRO WHICH CAN BE SEEN FROM THEIR PROPOSAL </p><p>TO LET HUMANITARIAN AID CONVOYS ENTER BIHAC ONLY IF AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME THEY RECEIVE HUMANITARIAN AID. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SUCH PROPOSALS ARE NO BASIS FOR A PEACEFUL </p><p>REINTEGRATION AND DO NOT CONTAIN ANSWERS TO ANY OF THE </p><p>CONDITIONS I MADE DURING THE TALKS WITH YOU ON </p><p>SATURDAY, 29 JULY, 1995, WHEN I EXPLICITLY SAID THAT </p><p>THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CROATIAN REBEL SERBS COULD </p><p>START UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: </p><p>     A)  THE CROATIAN AUTHORITIES SHALL NOT CONDUCT </p><p>TALKS WITH MILAN MARTIC, WHO WAS PUT BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL IN DEN HAGUE ON THE </p><p>LIST OF WAR CRIMINALS, AS WELL AS WITH NO OTHER PERSON </p><p>SPEAKING ON HIS BEHALF </p><p> </p><p>     B)  DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS SHALL BE CONDUCTED ON THE </p><p>OPENING OF ALL COMMUNICATIONS WHICH RUN THROUGH THE </p><p>OCCUPIED AREAS, ESPECIALLY OF THE ZAGREB-KNIN-SPLIT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02881  311645Z </p><p>RAILWAY </p><p> </p><p>     C)  AT THE SAME TIME, TALKS ON THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CROATIAN CONSTITUTION ON THE </p><p>OCCUPIED AREAS SHALL BEGIN, AS WELL AS THE TALKS ON THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACT </p><p>ON SERB ETHNIC COMMUNITY\'S RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ONLY ON THESE BASES IS IT POSSIBLE TO REACH A </p><p>PEACEFUL SOLUTION AND START THE PROPOSED NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN MILITARY AND CIVIL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE </p><p>CROATIAN AUTHORITIES AND THE CROATIAN REBEL SERBS. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
