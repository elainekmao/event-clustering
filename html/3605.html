<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001992 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/29/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW CABINET "ROTTEN TO THE CORE" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Kimberly Jemison.  Reasons: 1.5 (B) an </p><p>d (D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In an August 26 meeting, Eddison Zvobgo, an elder </p><p>statesman in ZANU-PF, provided insight into the Cabinet </p><p>reshuffle and pressure points for the international community </p><p>to pursue and he commented on the food situation, the Public </p><p>Order and Security Act, and the likelihood of a new </p><p>constitutional amendment to name a successor.  Zvobgo said </p><p>the Cabinet and ZANU-PF politburo function merely as rubber </p><p>stamps for Mugabe\'s decisions and he predicted the political </p><p>and economic crisis will worsen.  He was unsure of next steps </p><p>from the international community but did say that comments </p><p>akin to those delivered by Assistant Secretary Kansteiner and </p><p>using NEPAD as leverage to encourage other African leaders to </p><p>do more on Zimbabwe would go a long way towards isolating and </p><p>increasing pressure on Mugabe.  He also claimed that South </p><p>Africa has been providing Zimbabwe with electricity free of </p><p>charge for the last six months.         End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Cabinet Reshuffle </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On August 26, Polchief and Poloff met with Eddison </p><p>Zvobgo, an elder statesman in the ruling party who has been </p><p>estranged from  President Mugabe since 2000.   Zvobgo said </p><p>the new cabinet is "rotten to the core" and is comprised </p><p>exclusively of yes-men and yes-women, a sign that the </p><p>political and economic crises will get worse.  According to </p><p>Zvobgo, the Cabinet and ZANU-PF politburo now function merely </p><p>as rubber stamps for Mugabe\'s decisions, and never engage in </p><p>any genuine discussions of how to extricate Zimbabwe from its </p><p>current plight. </p><p> </p><p>Succession Scenarios </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Polchief noted the requirement in Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>constitution that an election be held within 90 days after </p><p>the presidency becomes vacant, and asked whether President </p><p>Mugabe intends to push through an amendment allowing his </p><p>successor to fill out the remaining years of his mandate. </p><p>Zvobgo, who chairs Parliament\'s legal committee, was </p><p>dismissive, saying that the ruling party does not have the </p><p>two-thirds majority in Parliament necessary for approval of </p><p>such an amendment.  All ZANU-PF MPs would likely vote in </p><p>favor, Zvobgo thought, but it was unlikely that any MDC </p><p>parliamentarians would cross the aisle.  (Comment:  We have </p><p>heard from several sources that the ruling party is trying, </p><p>with financial inducements, to lure several MDC legislators </p><p>to support such an amendment.  We would not be surprised if </p><p>Zvobgo is unaware of such efforts.  End Comment.)  Since such </p><p>an effort would almost certainly fail, Zvobgo predicted, </p><p>Mugabe likely will serve his full six-year term.  Although </p><p>ZANU-PF had stolen the presidential election, Mugabe and his </p><p>inner circle are not convinced they could steal another one. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Food Shortages </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Zvobgo described the food situation in his home </p><p>constituency of Masvingo south as "frightening" and said the </p><p>shortages in most  rural areas of Masvingo province are </p><p>"terrible and getting worse."  He was frustrated with his </p><p>inability to help his hungry constituents and criticized the </p><p>GOZ\'s Grain Marketing Board for attempting to provide food </p><p>assistance only to ZANU-PF supporters.  He claimed that </p><p>ZANU-PF supporters are bearing the brunt of food shortages, </p><p>since they are concentrated in rural districts, while MDC </p><p>supporters, concentrated primarily in urban areas, are in </p><p>much better shape.     Zvobgo expressed hope that the food </p><p>crisis would soon overwhelm GOZ\'s capacity to respond, </p><p>resulting in NGO\'s carrying the predominant load in </p><p>distributing food, a development he anticipated would </p><p>minimize incidents of people going hungry because of their </p><p>political affiliation. </p><p> </p><p>Selective application of rule of law </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Zvobgo condemned the GOZ\'s repression of the </p><p>opposition MDC and its supporters, saying the degree of </p><p>intolerance is "absolutely amazing."  He said the Public </p><p>Order and Security Act requires only that groups "notify" </p><p>police four days in advance of any public gathering, but </p><p>police are interpreting this provision as giving them the </p><p>right to grant or deny permission for such events.  In recent </p><p>weeks, Zvobgo said, police are not allowing any MDC meetings </p><p>or rallies to take place.  He also lamented continued </p><p>selective application of the law, noting that ZANU-PF </p><p>supporters who break the law usually go scot-free. </p><p> </p><p>Pressure points </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Zvobgo said remarks of the kind delivered recently by </p><p>Assistant Secretary Kansteiner are helpful in isolating and </p><p>increasing pressure on Mugabe.  Kansteiner\'s comments, he </p><p>said, engendered anger and anxiety among those in the inner </p><p>circle.  Asked what additional steps he thought the U.S. </p><p>should take on Zimbabwe, Zvobgo suggested expelling the </p><p>children of those responsible for the country\'s political and </p><p>economic crises, and providing as much food as possible to </p><p>rural areas, which were facing an "absolute calamity." </p><p>7.  (C) NEPAD, Zvobgo suggested, should be used as leverage </p><p>to encourage President Obasanjo and Mbeki to do more on </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Other potentially useful pressure points, he said, </p><p>are Zimbabwe\'s inability to cover its external debt, </p><p>particularly its lack of resources to purchase fuel and </p><p>electricity.  Zvobgo claimed that South Africa has been </p><p>supplying Zimbabwe with electricity free of charge for the </p><p>last six months, and he wondered how much longer the South </p><p>African government would be willing and able to continue that </p><p>arrangement. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The 60-something Zvobgo looked even more tired and </p><p>frail than usual.  He and his wife planned to travel to Cape </p><p>Town the following morning for several weeks of R&R and </p><p>medical consultations.  He seemed at a loss as to what steps </p><p>might force Mugabe to step back from the brink but believed, </p><p>as do most observers, that South Africa and President Mbeki </p><p>can play a key role should they choose to do so.  At the very </p><p>least, Zvobgo\'s claim that South Africa is supplying Zimbabwe </p><p>with electricity gratis certainly bears exploration. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
