<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000235 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>Department for EAP/BCLTV, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, KIRF, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: A LONG TIME COMING: PROTESTANT SEMINARY OPENS IN HCMC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  In keeping with longstanding GVN promises to allow the </p><p>opening of a new Protestant seminary, the leaders of the Southern </p><p>Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) recently inaugurated their </p><p>new Institute of Bible and Theology before a crowd numbering close </p><p>to 1000 at their main HCMC church.  (Classes will be held there </p><p>temporarily until they receive approval for a separate campus.) </p><p>The four-hour opening ceremony followed the basic outlines of a </p><p>religious service, complete with hymns, prayers and sermons.  The </p><p>only government official to speak was a representative of the </p><p>Religious Affairs Committee, who read the decision authorizing the </p><p>seminary.  Significantly, there was no other mention of the </p><p>government during the remainder of the ceremony.  None of the </p><p>speakers even acknowledged the government officials who attended </p><p>the ceremony during their remarks, normally common practice in </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The gathering was presided over by Acting SECV President </p><p>Duong Thanh, a former Vice President who assumed office after the </p><p>death of Reverend Pham Xuan Thieu in June 2002.  Among the many </p><p>other speakers was an elderly, frail, and nearly blind former Vice </p><p>Director of the pre-1975 Protestant seminary in Nha Trang, who </p><p>delivered a fiery 20-minute sermon in a booming voice.  Those in </p><p>attendance included a sprinkling of GVN and local officials, the </p><p>SECV hierarchy, administrators from the seminary, and the first 50 </p><p>seminarians, many of whom had yet to be formally accepted by the </p><p>GVN for admission.  Pastors, religious workers, and lay believers </p><p>(some from distant provinces) made up the remainder of the crowd, </p><p>which flowed out the main doors and down the stairs to the street. </p><p>A handful of American religious workers outfitted with headphones </p><p>for simultaneous interpretation were seated in the first few rows, </p><p>next to a congratulatory flower wreath from the Fatherland Front. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Poloff recognized a number of non-SECV-affiliated </p><p>pastors in the crowd, including some who have been generally </p><p>critical of the recognized church for "selling out" to the </p><p>government.  Most openly greeted Poloff in the aisles before and </p><p>after the ceremony.  They said they regarded the seminary opening </p><p>as a positive step, and one that should be publicly endorsed. </p><p>Most had faith in the strength of the academic program as a </p><p>grooming ground for future religious leaders, but doubted the </p><p>program could be kept free of GVN control.  (Post note:  Classes </p><p>began on February 17.  As of March 10, 38 of the promised 50 </p><p>students were enrolled, with only ten having received the required </p><p>permission from their local authorities.  End note.)  While Pastor </p><p>Thanh drew some praise for maintaining his patience and integrity </p><p>in a difficult job, the SECV itself seemed to be viewed in a much </p><p>more critical light by the unaffiliated house pastors. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  During the lunch for 300-plus pastors/religious workers </p><p>after the ceremony, several pastors with whom ConGenoffs spoke -- </p><p>including those from the Central Highlands and adjacent coastal </p><p>provinces -- seemed unconvinced this was a milestone in the </p><p>overall context of religious freedom in Vietnam.  They described </p><p>the general situation as somewhat improved over past years, but </p><p>still highly problematic in certain locations.  Yet none could </p><p>offer any firsthand accounts of harassment or oppression over the </p><p>recent Christmas season.  They acknowledged they had been able to </p><p>celebrate the holidays with their own congregations without </p><p>government interference, even if they had heard second or </p><p>thirdhand of problems in some of the more sensitive areas.  Some </p><p>pastors said they had been required to obtain permission from </p><p>their local authorities to attend this opening ceremony.  Others </p><p>said they had decided to come even though they had never received </p><p>permission.  (Post note: This inconsistency tracks with our </p><p>general experience that enforcement of many -- if not most -- </p><p>government regulations varies from province to province, even </p><p>district to district, in the South.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  In the course catalogue for the new seminary, the English </p><p>translation notes that the old Nha Trang Bible and Theological </p><p>Institute was closed in December 1976 for political reasons.  The </p><p>original Vietnamese says that classes were simply interrupted, </p><p>without giving a reason why.  There is also a requirement that all </p><p>seminarians study "Citizen Education."  The course description in </p><p>English notes that "understanding of religious policy will help </p><p>students know how to lead local congregations well." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Comment:  The long-awaited opening of a recognized </p><p>Protestant seminary is a significant step in the development of </p><p>the Protestant church in southern Vietnam.  That the inaugural </p><p>ceremony was carried out in such a public manner, with widespread </p><p>press coverage, is not surprising -- the GVN was happy to take </p><p>credit for a good news story on religious freedom.  (GVN officials </p><p>sat through this four-hour ceremony, even though they were openly </p><p>stiffed.)  The fact that "illegal" house pastors made their </p><p>presence unabashedly known, were genuinely complimentary about the </p><p>seminary, and warmly greeted ConGenoffs, is indicative of the </p><p>complexities and inconsistencies surrounding their criticism of </p><p>GVN religious policies.  These house pastors agree that the </p><p>opening of a Protestant seminary is a small but positive step down </p><p>the long road toward SECV legitimacy in the eyes of "all </p><p>believers." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
