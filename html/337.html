<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 MOSCOW 04215 </p><p> </p><p>FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY FROM HA A/S SCHIFTER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, US, RO </p><p>SUBJECT:  IMPRESSIONS OF POLITICAL SITUATION IN ROMANIA </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING MY SHORT STAY IN ROMANIA I MET WITH FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER ALAC, DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER NEAGU, JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER POP, RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS MINISTER STOICESCU, </p><p>LEADERS OF THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES (PEASANTS, </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERALS, AND SOCIAL DEMOCRATS) AND LEADERS OF </p><p>TWO NEWLY CREATED LABOR UNIONS.  I SPOKE AT LENGTH TO </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR, THE DCM, AND POLITICAL OFFICERS AND </p><p>FOUND ALL OF THEM IN STRONG AGREEMENT IN THEIR </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION HERE:  IF ANYONE CAN SAVE </p><p>ROMANIA FROM THE CHAOS IT WILL HAVE TO BE THE NATIONAL </p><p>SALVATION FRONT, THAT THE FRONT\'S BASIC INCLINATION IS </p><p>TO ESTABLISH A DEMOCRACY, THAT OUR INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>ROMANIA CAN STRENGTHEN THAT INCLINATION, THAT THE </p><p>LEADERS OF THE OLD PARTIES SIMPLY DON\'T HAVE WHAT IT </p><p>TAKES TO LEAD, AND THAT THERE IS NO OTHER POLITICAL </p><p>FORCE ON THE SCENE.  THE EMBASSY ALSO BELIEVES THAT </p><p>ANALYSES MADE IN WASHINGTON ON THE BASIS OF VARIOUS </p><p>FRAGMENTS OF INFORMATION LACK THE FEELING THAT CAN BE </p><p>PROVIDED ONLY BY ON-THE-SPOT OBSERVATION.  I FIND </p><p>MYSELF IN FULL AGREEMENT WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE </p><p>EMBASSY\'S ASSESSMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  NONE OF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WITH WHOM I MET </p><p>REFLECTED ANY COMMUNIST THINKING IN THEIR REMARKS TO </p><p>ME. THE EMBASSY STRONGLY PROTESTED AGAINST THE </p><p>TRASHING OF PEASANT PARTY HEADQUARTERS BY FRONT </p><p>SUPPORTERS AND I BELIEVE THE PROTEST WAS DULY NOTED. </p><p>I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR POLICY SHOULD BE BASED ON </p><p>THAT SINGLE INCIDENT.  IF ACTIONS OF THIS KIND EVER </p><p>BECOME A PATTERN, WE WOULD, OF COURSE, HAVE TO </p><p>REASSESS THE SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  JUSTICE MINISTER POP SPENT QUITE SOME TIME </p><p>OUTLINING HIS OBJECTIVES.  HE WAS CLEARLY WELL VERSED </p><p>IN WESTERN LEGAL THINKING.  HE SPOKE OF PLANS FOR THE </p><p>ADOPTION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION AND GUARANTEEING </p><p>INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.  HE SPOKE </p><p>ALSO OF HIS PLANS TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL </p><p>SYSTEM.  I DID NOT HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS </p><p>MOUTHING PHRASES.  IT SEEMED ALL WELL THOUGHT THROUGH </p><p>AND GENUINE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS MINISTER STOICESCU WAS A </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS SO STRONG AN </p><p>ORTHODOX BELIEVER THAT HE LEFT ME WITH THE IMPRESSION </p><p>THAT OTHER DENOMINATIONS MIGHT NOT GET A FAIR SHAKE. </p><p>I TRIED TO IMPRESS ON HIM THAT HE MUST LIVE UP TO </p><p>ROMANIA\'S HELSINKI COMMITMENT TO RESPECT ALL RELIGIONS </p><p>AND URGED HIM TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE WITH THE EMBASSY </p><p>ON THIS SUBJECT.  STOICESCU IS CLEARLY A LONG-TERM </p><p>ENEMY OF COMMUNISM, COMING FROM THE OLD-LINE </p><p>CONSERVATIVE CAMP.  AS I WAS PREACHING TO HIM ABOUT </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, HE EYED ME SUSPICIOUSLY AT ONE </p><p>POINT AND ASKED WHETHER I WAS A BAPTIST.  (THE </p><p>BAPTISTS WANT HIS MINISTRY TO BE ABOLISHED.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIALS STRONGLY EMPHASIZED </p><p>THEIR INTENTIONS TO HAVE ROMANIA LIVE UP TO ALL ITS </p><p>OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE HELSINKI FINAL ACT.  CELAC </p><p>TENDED TO BE SOMEWHAT OBNOXIOUS IN HIS COMPLAINT ABOUT </p><p>U.S. ALLEGED FAILURE TO EXPRESS ITSELF IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>ROMANIAN DEMOCRACY.  HE MEANT THAT WE HAD NOT SENT A </p><p>SIGNAL IN THE DIRECTION OF THE NSF. </p><p> </p><p>7.  AS TO THE LEADER OF THE TRADITIONAL PARTIES, I WAS </p><p>LEFT WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY HAVE SIMPLY COME </p><p>OUT OF RETIREMENT TO ANNOUNCE THAT THEY HAVE </p><p>SURVIVED.  IT DOES NOT SEEM AS IF THEY HAVE MADE MUCH </p><p>OF AN EFFORT TO PUT AN ORGANIZATION TOGETHER. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, GIVEN THE AD HOC CHARACTER OF THE NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF UNCERTAINTY, </p><p>THE INCLUSION OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TRADITIONAL </p><p>PARTIES IN THE TRANSITION GOVERNMENT WOULD BE OF </p><p>SYMBOLIC VALUE AND WOULD HAVE A REASSURING EFFECT ON </p><p>THE GENERAL PUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p>8.  MY OVERALL IMPRESSION, BASED ON WHAT I HAVE READ AS </p><p>WELL AS WHAT I SAW IN BUCHAREST, IS THE FOLLOWING:  THE </p><p>ROMANIAN COMMUNIST PARTY THAT EMERGED AT THE END OF THE </p><p>STALIN ERA HAS LIKE THE OTHER COMMUNIST PARTIES IN </p><p>EASTERN EUROPE IN THAT IT WAS HELD TOGETHER BY A STRONG </p><p>IDEOLOGY AND CLOSE BONDS OF MUTUAL LOYALTY AMONG </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE NOMENKLATURA.  AS IN THE CASE OF OTHER </p><p>PARTIES, THE IDEOLOGY EVAPORATED IN THE SEVENTIES.  BUT </p><p>UNLIKE THE OTHER PARTIES, IN WHICH FRATERNAL BONDS KEPT </p><p>THE NOMENKLATURA TOGETHER, THE COMMUNIST PARTY BONDS IN </p><p>ROMANIA DISSOLVED AS CEAUSESCU ESTABLISHED WHAT WAS IN </p><p>EFFECT A BYZANTINE IMPERIAL COURT.  THERE WERE NO </p><p>LONGER ANY FRATERNAL BONDS.  THERE WAS ONLY A DIRECT </p><p>LINE OF LOYALTY FROM EACH INDIVIDUAL COURTIER TO </p><p>CEAUSESCU.  ANY OFFICIAL WHO CROSSED THE LEADER OR </p><p>DISPLEASED HIM OR WAS DENOUNCED WAS DEMOTED, FIRED, OR </p><p>JAILED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  GIVEN THE FOREGOING STATE OF AFFAIRS, CEAUSESCU\'S </p><p>DEATH CAUSED THE ENTIRE SYSTEM TO SHATTER OVERNIGHT. </p><p>THERE WAS NO COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP GROUP TO CLOSE RANKS, </p><p>AS IN BULGARIA AFTER ZHIVKOV\'S OUSTER.  CEAUSESCU\'S </p><p>MINIONS HAD NO RELATIONSHIP TO EACH OTHER.  THEY FELL </p><p>BY THE WAYSIDE.  WHAT THEN CAME TOGETHER WERE THE </p><p>PEOPLE WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN OUSTED FROM PROMINENT </p><p>POSITIONS, WHO THEN JOINED WITH MORE JUNIOR OFFICIALS </p><p>IN AN EFFORT TO PUT TOGETHER A GOVERNMENT CAPABLE OF </p><p>FUNCTIONING. </p><p> </p><p>10.  TO BE SURE, MOST OF THE NEW LEADERS WERE ONCE </p><p>COMMUNISTS, WHETHER OF THE BELIEVING OR THE OPPORTUNIST </p><p>VARIETY.  CAN THEY BE TRUSTED NOW?  I BELIEVE THEY CAN </p><p>BECAUSE (A) THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HAS EMBITTERED </p><p>THEM AGAINST TOTALITARIAN RULE (THEY USE THAT TERM|), </p><p>AND (B) EVEN IF THEY ARE CYNICS (AND I AM SURE NONE OF </p><p>THEM ARE), THEY KNOW WHICH WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING AND </p><p>WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO GET THE FOREIGN HELP THEY NEED. </p><p> </p><p>11.  AS THE NSF APPEARS FOR THE TIME BEING TO BE THE </p><p>ONLY GAME IN TOWN TO KEEP ROMANIA FUNCTIONING AND AS WE </p><p>CAN BRING OUR INFLUENCE TO BEAR TO STEER THE FRONT IN </p><p>THE RIGHT DIRECTION, I STRONGLY CONCUR IN THE BUCHAREST </p><p>EMBASSY\'S APPROACH AND RECOMMENDATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>MATLOCK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
