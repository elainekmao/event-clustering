Monday\'s "Milliyet" claims that the military </p><p>has advised the government to provide support for air </p><p>operations, but to refrain from promises on ground troops. </p><p>Ankara is also negative about the use of Turkish ports, </p><p>Milliyet reports.  However, the government has accepted air </p><p>base inspections in Batman, Diyarbakir, Mus, and Malatya. </p><p>Ankara wants a wider coalition against Saddam Hussein, and </p><p>believes that Muslim countries must be convinced to join the </p><p>U.S. and UK in their efforts to topple the tyrant, weekend </p><p>papers note.  Sunday\'s dailies report that U.S. Ambassador </p><p>to Ankara Robert Pearson has urged Prime Minister Abdullah </p><p>Gul to decide in the coming days about U.S. military </p><p>requests.  After meeting with Ambassador Pearson on </p><p>Saturday, Prime Minister Gul said Ankara would wait to see </p><p>the first report by UN weapons inspectors.  Ankara, </p><p>skeptical of U.S. intentions in Northern Iraq, is not </p><p>enthusiastic about large numbers of U.S. troops being </p><p>stationed in Turkey, Monday\'s papers say.  A final `summit\' </p><p>meeting will be held this evening, including the Prime </p><p>Minister, Foreign Minister, and Chief of TGS.  The `summit\' </p><p>will lay the groundwork for a government decision to be </p><p>submitted to parliament for approval this week.  Monday\'s </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" outlines U.S. demands from Turkey: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- the use of air bases in Batman, Incirlik, Malatya, </p><p>Diyarbakir, and Afyon; </p><p>-- access to ports in Mersin, Iskenderun, Samsun, and </p><p>Trabzon; </p><p>-- an estimated 100,000 U.S. troops to be deployed in </p><p>Turkey, subject to NATO regulations, </p><p>-- missile defense systems will to be set up in Turkey. </p><p>Cumhuriyet also draws attention to forthcoming visits to </p><p>Turkey by Iraqi opposition leaders Sharif Ali Bin Hussein </p><p>and Ayad Allawi, and Northern Iraqi Kurdish leaders Barzani </p><p>and Talabani this week.  The paper regards these meetings as </p><p>part of Turkey\'s preparation for the post-Saddam period. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Monday\'s "Zaman" reports that U.S. Special Cyprus </p><p>Coordinator Thomas Weston urged the sides in Cyprus to reach </p><p>a compromise before the end of February.  Weston said there </p><p>was enough time for a settlement, and urged both parties to </p><p>make compromises.  Weston said that the decision reached at </p><p>the Copenhagen summit --unconditional EU membership for </p><p>Cyprus, and a date to begin membership negotiations for </p><p>Turkey -- was positive.  A "Radikal" commentary suspects </p><p>that Ankara is inclined to delay implementation of a </p><p>possible Cyprus deal until Turkey\'s EU accession is assured. </p><p>Radikal says that Ankara is trying to blackmail the EU via </p><p>Cyprus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Constitutional amendments: The parliament is to discuss this </p><p>week the constitutional package vetoed by President Sezer. </p><p>The government is expected to send back the package to Sezer </p><p>without changes on Friday, papers report.  A press amnesty </p><p>bill drafted to lift the ban on AKP leader Erdogan will be </p><p>enacted this week.  The former leader of the pro-Kurdish </p><p>party HADEP, Murat Bozlak, voiced support for Sezer\'s veto. </p><p>Bozlak, who was also barred from running for election to </p><p>parliament, said that the changes were tailored for Erdogan </p><p>alone.  Bozlak, (the former Human Rights Association </p><p>chairman) Akin Birdal, and (banned Islamist leader) Erbakan </p><p>have received prison terms of one year for violating Article </p><p>312, while Erdogan was sentenced to ten months.  The </p><p>Constitutional liberalization would not have applied to </p><p>those sentenced to at least one year of prison.  "The </p><p>Constitution must be amended to remove bans on all </p><p>politicians, not only on Erdogan," Bozlak reportedly said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Listen to what the US military has to say" </p><p>Washington correspondent of mass appeal Milliyet, Yasemin </p><p>Congar wrote: (12/23): "Contrary to ongoing speculation </p><p>about the start of a US military strike as early as </p><p>February, members of the American military tell it </p><p>differently.  Their assessment that an operation would take </p><p>place either sometime next summer or toward the end of 2003. </p><p>. The reason for their uncommon evaluation stems from </p><p>military facts.  The military knows that in the event of an </p><p>extensive war -- the figure in the press is some 200,000 </p><p>troops -- detailed preparations will require at least 4 to 6 </p><p>months. . My military sources in Washington who are familiar </p><p>with the capabilities and logistics of the US army remind </p><p>that the military build-up during the Gulf War was carried </p><p>out via aircraft carriers.  That brings us to three </p><p>countries which have ports with ground access to Iraq: </p><p>Turkey, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  The Saudis are reluctant </p><p>to cooperate, and Kuwait\'s port capacity is very limited. </p><p>This is the reason for Washington\'s gradually increasing </p><p>pressure on Turkey." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The pretext for US military deployment: Deterrence" </p><p>Zeynep Gurcanli wrote in tabloid Star (12/23): "Washington </p><p>has finally come up with a pretext in order to break </p><p>Ankara\'s reluctance about the stationing of US troops in </p><p>Turkey.  The use of bases and ports by the US military will </p><p>be presented under the pretext of `modernization,\' and the </p><p>deployment of US troops on Turkish soil will be a `show of </p><p>force for deterrence.\'  . From now on, we should be ready to </p><p>see a dramatic increase in the US military presence in </p><p>Turkey.  First, US special operations teams are expected. </p><p>These will be followed by many others. . Turkey has not yet </p><p>given its approval to be a host country for US military </p><p>operations against Iraq.  The inclusion of NATO as part of </p><p>the operation seems to be a possible way to break Ankara\'s </p><p>resistance on the issue. . War is knocking at the door.  It </p><p>is only a matter of time before all the pretexts are worked </p><p>out." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
