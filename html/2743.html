<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001818 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, SOCI, IT, EUN, UNICEF, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: SICHAN SIV ROME MEETINGS CONCERNING UNGASS ON </p><p>CHILDREN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 66892 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLMINCOUN TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON 1.5 (B), (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFFS, AMBASSADOR TO THE UN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01818  111403Z </p><p>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL SICHAN SIV AND L/HRR MICHAEL </p><p>DENNIS MET 4/10 WITH OFFICIALS FROM THE MINISTRIES OF </p><p>LABOR/WELFARE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO DISCUSS ISSUES BEFORE </p><p>THE 5/8-10 UN SPECIAL SESSION ON CHILDREN (REF).  BOTH OF </p><p>THEIR LABOR/WELFARE MINISTRY INTERLOCUTORS (UNDERSECRETARY </p><p>GRAZIA SESTINI AND DIPLOMATIC COUNSELOR ALBERTO COLELLA) WILL </p><p>BE MEMBERS OF THE ITALIAN DELEGATION TO THE SPECIAL SESSION. </p><p>OF THEIR MFA INTERLOCUTORS -- CLAUDIO BISOGNIERO, RAFAELE DI </p><p>LUTIO, EMANUELE PIGNATELLI -- THE LATTER WILL BE THE SENIOR </p><p>MFA OFFICIAL IN THE DELEGATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR SIV SAID THAT, WHILE THE U.S. CAN ACCEPT </p><p>THAT THE CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD CONTAINS </p><p>STANDARDS OF IMPORTANCE, IT COULD NOT ACCEPT THAT THE </p><p>CONVENTION ESTABLISHED THE STANDARD FOR ACTIONS CONCERNING </p><p>THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN.  HE SAID THE U.S. SENATE IS </p><p>CONSIDERING RATIFICATION OF THE CONVENTION\'S TWO OPTIONAL </p><p>PROTOCOLS, AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HOPED TO SECURE ADVICE </p><p>AND CONSENT TO RATIFICATION BEFORE THE START OF THE SPECIAL </p><p>SESSION.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT VARIOUS SENATORS HAD </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE CONVENTION ITSELF.  REFERRING TO </p><p>THE SESSION\'S OUTCOME DOCUMENT, AMBASSADOR SIV SAID THE USG </p><p>CANNOT ACCEPT THE PHRASE "REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES" SINCE </p><p>OTHER DELEGATIONS HAVE ASSERTED THAT THIS REFERS TO ABORTION. </p><p> ON THE OTHER HAND, HE NOTED, "REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE" IS </p><p>FINE, IF NOT LINKED TO THE PREVIOUS UN CONFERENCE OUTCOME </p><p>DOCUMENTS FROM CAIRO ON POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND FROM </p><p>BEIJING ON WOMEN.  AMBASSADOR SIV WELCOMED LANGUAGE IN THE </p><p>3/18 TEXT PROPOSED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PREPARATORY </p><p>COMMITTEE AS A GOOD BASIS FOR NEGOTIATION.  MR. DENNIS </p><p>FURTHER CLARIFIED SPECIFIC CHANGES THAT THE U.S. WOULD NEED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01818  111403Z </p><p>TO THE DRAFT TEXT CONCERNING REFERENCES TO THE CONVENTION ON </p><p>THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, CHILDREN IN </p><p>ARMED CONFLICT AND ON THE SALE OF CHILDREN, CHILD </p><p>PROSTITUTION, AND CHILD PORNOGRAPHY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WHILE OFFICIALS AT BOTH MINISTRIES WERE FORTHCOMING, </p><p>LABOR/WELFARE UNDERSECRETARY SESTINI SAID UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT </p><p>ITALY SHARES U.S. VIEWS ON ABORTION AND WOULD SUPPORT OUR </p><p>OPPOSITION TO "REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES."  UNDERSECRETARY </p><p>SESTINI NOTED A DIFFERENCE WITH U.S. VIEWS REGARDING HEALTH. </p><p>WHEREAS U.S. LAW GUARANTEES CITIZENS "ACCESS" TO REPRODUCTIVE </p><p>HEALTH CARE, THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES CITIZENS A </p><p>"RIGHT" TO HEALTH.  THE GOI DELEGATION TO THE SPECIAL SESSION </p><p>ACCORDINGLY WILL SEEK LANGUAGE ON THIS POINT THAT IS </p><p>COMPATIBLE WITH NATIONAL LAW. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: AS AN ELECTED SENATOR (AND MEMBER OF THE </p><p>SAME FORZA ITALIA PARTY AS PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI), </p><p>UNDERSECRETARY SESTINI\'S SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. POSITION ON </p><p>ABORTION CAN BE CONSIDERED DEFINITIVE OF GOI VIEWS.  THE </p><p>ITALIAN DELEGATION TO THE SPECIAL SESSION IS TO BE HEADED BY </p><p>LABOR/WELFARE MINISTER ROBERTO MARONI.  SHOULD DOMESTIC </p><p>EVENTS PRECLUDE MARONI FROM ATTENDING, HOWEVER, SENATOR </p><p>SESTINI IS LIKELY TO HEAD THE DELEGATION IN HIS PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) OTHER ISSUES: AMB. SIV THANKED DEPUTY POLITICAL </p><p>DIRECTOR BISOGNIERO FOR ITALY\'S DECISION TO POSTPONE ITS </p><p>CANDIDACY FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, OPENING THE PATH </p><p>FOR THE U.S. TO RETURN.  BISOGNIERO NOTED THAT IT WAS </p><p>IMPORTANT TO PRIME MINISTER (AND ACTING FM) BERLUSCONI THAT </p><p>THE U.S. RETURN.  HE HOPED THE U.S. WOULD URGE THOSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01818  111403Z </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT STILL HAD OBJECTIONS TO THE ICELANDIC PROPOSAL </p><p>FOR WEOG ROTATION TO "CALM DOWN" AND ACCEPT THE PLAN. </p><p>BISOGNIERO ALSO HANDED OVER A NOTE VERBALE REQUESTING THE </p><p>U.S. TO SUPPORT THE ITALIAN CANDIDACY FOR THE COMMISSION FOR </p><p>THE PREVENTION OF CRIME AND PENAL JUSTICE IN THE ELECTIONS IN </p><p>ECOSOC 4/29-30. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01818 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
