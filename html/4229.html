Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Embassy is concerned with the delays in </p><p>implementing the Grant Agreement between Turkey and the </p><p>United States, signed on September 13, involving nearly $200 </p><p>million in grant assistance to Turkey.  We understand there </p><p>are technical legal problems between the Federal Reserve Bank </p><p>of New York and USAID holding up disbursement of this grant. </p><p>The Turkish Government in its debt program has planned to use </p><p>these funds to make payments to the IMF November 7. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) We are concerned that the intent of this grant, to </p><p>recognize Turkey\'s contribution to the Global War on </p><p>Terrorism by taking the lead on peace-keeping in Afghanistan, </p><p>is being lost in our internal bureaucratic hurdles. The </p><p>Turkish Treasury has informed us that the eight-week delay is </p><p>not explicable.  Ultimately the danger is that this delay </p><p>reduces the benefit to U.S. interests from the grant. </p><p>Embassy urges State and Treasury to raise with both USAID and </p><p>the Federal Reserve Bank the urgency of finalizing </p><p>arrangements for disbursing this loan this week. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
