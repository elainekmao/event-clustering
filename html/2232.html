<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002985 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/26/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, MOPS, MARR, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED ON BENUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABJUA 2982 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by PolCouns and </p><p>PolMilOff, called on NSA Aliyu Mohammed on November 11. The </p><p>President\'s Special Coordinator on Sudan, Dr. Usman Bugaje </p><p>also attended.  This message covers their conversation on </p><p>recent events in Benue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY CONTINUED: Defensive of the President and the </p><p>Federal Government, Mohammed placed the blame for the </p><p>civilian deaths squarely on the shoulders of the Tiv militia </p><p>in Benue.  While the military and security services have </p><p>begun inquiries, the NSA was unsure if the Federal Government </p><p>would carry out its own investigation or whether a Benue </p><p>State Government investigation would be undertaken. </p><p>Ambassador urged the NSA to move quickly to a transparent </p><p>review.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>THE NSA\'S OPTIC </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The NSA, responding to the Ambassador\'s request for </p><p>explanation of what happened in Benue, explained that after </p><p>recent failed local and state government interventions to </p><p>cool the Tin-Jukun conflict, Tiv militia had set roadblocks </p><p>throughout the area.  Anyone passing would have to pay a </p><p>toll, unless they were Jukun or Fulani, in which case they </p><p>could be killed.  When the police could not contain and </p><p>eliminate the militia activities, the Governors of Benue and </p><p>Taraba States had asked the President to send in the Army. </p><p>At one roadblock in the area near Zaki-Biam, 20 soldiers had </p><p>come upon a roadblock, and had asked to speak with the Tiv </p><p>militia leader.  To do so, the soldiers were informed, they </p><p>would have to put down their weapons, to which the Captain </p><p>agreed.  After doing so, the soldiers were slaughtered "like </p><p>rams," Mohammed said, gesturing across his belly.  The </p><p>President gave the Benue Governor, George Akume, 24 hours to </p><p>hand over the guilty militiamen.  Akume said he was unable to </p><p>do so, and asked the President to send more soldiers, </p><p>according to the NSA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador Jeter noted that, according to reports that </p><p>we had received, between 100 and 300 unarmed civilians </p><p>reportedly had been killed, including women and children. </p><p>Who gave the orders, the Ambassador asked?  The NSA responded </p><p>defensively, saying that the Federal Government was </p><p>responsible for the lives and property of each and every </p><p>Nigerian.  Nigeria has lost over one million people in the </p><p>civil war, and more in coups and ethnic conflicts.  The </p><p>President\'s first act on May 29, 1999, the NSA declared, was </p><p>to commute a death sentence of a Nigerian soldier, because, </p><p>as President, he "would not intentionally spill the blood of </p><p>a single Nigerian."  "How could anyone believe that the </p><p>President would do such a thing?", the NSA asked.  Many </p><p>people in Benue were heavily armed, and taking the law into </p><p>their own hands.  To prove his point, the NSA said, that even </p><p>after the killing of the 19 soldiers, the Tiv militia had </p><p>continued to mount roadblocks and had ambushed the second </p><p>group of soldiers sent in. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>JUDICIAL COMMISION OF INQUIRY </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Responding to recent press reports of a planned </p><p>judicial commission of inquiry, the NSA said he was unsure </p><p>the form the official inquiry would take.  The military had </p><p>already begun an internal investigation; the security </p><p>services were undertaking one as well.  However, Mohammed was </p><p>unsure whether the Federal Government or Benue State would </p><p>establish a commission, as had been done in Kaduna, Bauchi </p><p>and Jos.  In any case, the terms of reference were still </p><p>being worked out.  Ambassador Jeter explained that without an </p><p>open and transparent inquiry, and an exhaustive and fair </p><p>response, the U.S.-Nigeria military-to-military relationship </p><p>could be affected.  The USG and Congress were watching this </p><p>development closely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador Jeter went on to note that he planned to </p><p>travel to Benue soon to see for himself what had happened. </p><p>The NSA said that was a matter for the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs, but, almost as an aside, he said he would not expect </p><p>Ambassador Aminu to go to Chicago "to see for himself" if </p><p>something similar had happened there.  In any case, there was </p><p>still tension in the area and such a trip could be dangerous, </p><p>the NSA warned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: Popular perceptions of Tiv culpability, </p><p>coupled with horrific acts against government soldiers (the </p><p>last line of defense in internal conflicts), have muted the </p><p>GON\'s response to apparent Army brutality.  The village-to </p><p>-village action, which could have been driven in part by </p><p>pursuit of fleeing Tiv militia, will have to be clarified in </p><p>an open and transparent fashion.  Only an independent and </p><p>impartial review will allow the GON to clear its name and </p><p>sanction those who may have been responsible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: The NSA\'s aggressive response of </p><p>the President was surprising, as the Ambassador never stated </p><p>or implied that the President was responsible for giving the </p><p>fatal order. However, early public claims from Benue Governor </p><p>Akume and Tiv leaders that placed blame at the President\'s </p><p>feet (since retracted by the Governor) may have been the </p><p>source of the NSA\'s unease. </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: More than most, the NSA clearly </p><p>understands the depth of U.S. concerns about the Benue </p><p>massacre, and the serious implications for our bilateral </p><p>military-to-military relationship if senior-level culpability </p><p>is confirmed. END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
