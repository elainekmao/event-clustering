<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 000531 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, PHUM, PREL, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN HAPPY WITH TRIPS MORATORIUM, PRESSES FOR </p><p>FINAL AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 26895 B) VATICAN 307 C) 02 VATICAN 6064 </p><p> </p><p>1.  DCM SHARED REF A FOLLOW-UP POINTS ON THE TRIPS MORATORIUM </p><p>WITH VATICAN DFM MONS. PIETRO PAROLIN AND IO DIRECTOR MONS. </p><p>OSVALDO NEVEZ ON FEBRUARY 2.  BOTH EXPRESSED GRATITUDE FOR </p><p>THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND REAFFIRMED THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE U.S. NEED TO DEFEND INTELLECTUAL </p><p>PROPERTY IN ORDER TO ENSURE CONTINUED RESEARCH AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00531  100944Z </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES.  THEY WELCOMED THE </p><p>U.S. MORATORIUM AS A TEMPORARY MEASURE TO ENSURE </p><p>PHARMACEUTICAL ACCESS FOR THE NEEDIEST COUNTRIES, BUT </p><p>REITERATED THEIR DESIRE TO SEE AN AGREEMENT REACHED AS SOON </p><p>AS POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT THE DOHA DECLARATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  MONSIGNOR NEVES WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO EXPLAIN THAT </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN\'S DECEMBER NOTE VERBALE URGING THE </p><p>U.S. NOT TO BLOCK CONSENSUS ON DOHA (REF C) WAS THE RESULT OF </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION IN GENEVA FROM "A NUMBER </p><p>OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES" AND REFLECTED THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>PERCEPTION AT THAT TIME THE USG WAS BLOCKING CONCLUSION OF A </p><p>FINAL AGREEMENT.  THEY SAID THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES WITH R AND D INTERESTS WERE WILLING TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>TEXT, WHILE THE U.S. WAS NOT.  THE HOLY SEE NOW HAS A MORE </p><p>COMPLETE APPRECIATION FOR THE U.S. POSITION, HOWEVER, AND </p><p>BOTH OFFICIALS REPEATED THAT THE U.S. TRIPS ENFORCEMENT </p><p>MORATORIUM WAS A "VERY IMPORTANT" MEASURE.  PAROLIN AND NEVES </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT THE HOLY SEE WAS "PLEASED" WITH THE FACT </p><p>THAT THE USG WAS GOING AHEAD WITH THE MORATORIUM IMMEDIATELY </p><p>AND HAD BEEN JOINED BY THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>3.  LOOKING TO THE NEXT ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS IN GENEVA, </p><p>NEVES SAID THE HOLY SEE WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS FROM A </p><p>PRINCIPLED HUMANITARIAN POSITION FOR A FINAL AGREEMENT ON </p><p>IMPLEMENTING DOHA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  NEVES OFFERED THAT </p><p>THE DISCUSSIONS HAD REACHED A "TECHNICAL LEVEL" AT WHICH HE </p><p>BELIEVED MIDDLE GROUND COULD BE REACHED QUICKLY.  ASKED WHAT </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS THE HOLY SEE WOULD SEND ARCHBISHOP DIARMUID </p><p>MARTIN, ITS GENEVA PERMANENT OBSERVER, THEY SAID HE WOULD </p><p>RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS TO "PRESS ALL SIDES TO REACH A FINAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00531  100944Z </p><p>AGREEMENT."  (NOTE: MARTIN WILL VISIT ROME IN MARCH AND WE </p><p>WILL SEEK TO REVIEW THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION ON TRIPS WITH HIM </p><p>AT THAT TIME.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN CONCLUDING, DEPUTY FM PAROLIN, IN AN EFFORT TO SMOOTH </p><p>OVER DIFFERENCES ARISING FROM THE CRITICAL STANCE THEY HAD </p><p>ADOPTED IN DECEMBER (REFS B AND C), INTERJECTED THAT THE HOLY </p><p>SEE "WANTED TO STRESS THAT IT IS HAPPY AND SUPPORTS" THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S STATE OF THE UNION ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE USG </p><p>WOULD INCREASE HIV/AIDS FUNDING BY USD 10 BILLION.   HE ALSO </p><p>NOTED THAT THE HOLY SEE IS AWARE THAT AMERICAN PRIVATE SECTOR </p><p>SUPPORT FOR HUMANITARIAN AND MEDICAL RELIEF IN THE DEVELOPING </p><p>WORLD IS AN IMPORTANT, ALBEIT SOMETIMES OVERLOOKED, </p><p>CONTRIBUTION.  (NOTE; THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S CONTRIBUTION IS </p><p>ALSO IMPORTANT AND OFTEN OVERLOOKED -- IT PROVIDES NEARLY 25 </p><p>PERCENT OF AIDS CARE WORLD-WIDE). </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA00531 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
