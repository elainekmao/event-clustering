(C) SUMMARY: ON APRIL 26 THE MINISTER OF HOME </p><p>AFFAIRS REPEATED THE PARTY LINE TO AMBASSADOR MCDONALD </p><p>THAT THE OCCUPATIONS OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMS IS A </p><p>"POLITICAL ISSUE" WITH WHICH NEITHER HE NOR THE POLICE </p><p>MAY INTERFERE, AS LONG AS THE TAKEOVERS ARE PEACEFUL. </p><p>DABENGWA MAINTAINS THAT THE POLICE ARE UNDER INSTRUCTION </p><p>TO INVESTIGATE AND ARREST THOSE WHO HARM PEOPLE OR </p><p>PROPERTY ON THE FARMS.  TO DATE, HOWEVER, WE HAVE SEEN </p><p>NO EVIDENCE OF ANY ARREST FOR THE MURDERS OF TWO WHITE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS OR THE HUNDREDS OF BLACK FARM WORKERS </p><p>WHO HAVE BEEN INTIMIDATED, RAPED, OR KILLED.  THE </p><p>MINISTER EXPRESSED A GREATER DESIRE TO STOP THE </p><p>WIDESPREAD POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN URBAN AREAS, BUT AGAIN </p><p>HAS YET TO DEMONSTRATE STRONG LEADERSHIP BY PUBLICIZING </p><p>ANY INVESTIGATIONS OR ARRESTS FOLLOWING SEVERAL DEATHS. </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY MEMBERS SAY THE POLICE ARE UNDER </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS NOT TO MAKE ARRESTS IN ELECTION-RELATED </p><p>CRIMES AS THEY TOO ARE DEEMED "POLITICAL MATTERS."  IN </p><p>OUR JUDGMENT, PUTTING AN END TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE RESTS WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE WHO CONTINUES TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02297  01 OF 03  271542Z </p><p>SHOW NO INCLINATION TO STOP THE FARM OCCUPATIONS OR THE </p><p>ATTACKS ON OPPOSITION PARTY SUPPORTERS.  IN RESPONSE, </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, IN THE STRONGEST TERMS, CHASTISED </p><p>THE GOZ AND THE ZANU-PF PARTY FOR ORGANIZING AND </p><p>ENCOURAGING THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) FOLLOWING THE APRIL 26 SIGNING OF THE U.S.- </p><p>ZIMBABWE EXTRADITION TREATY, AMBASSADOR MCDONALD MEET </p><p>PRIVATELY WITH MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS, DUMISO </p><p>DABENGWA, TO RAISE OUR CONCERNS OVER THE ONGOING AND </p><p>EVER INCREASING POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF (NOTETAKER), </p><p>EXPRESSED U.S. CONDEMNATION OF AND DISGUST WITH THE </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE OCCURRING ON THE OCCUPIED COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMS AGAINST BLACK FARM WORKERS, INCLUDING REPORTS OF </p><p>LYNCHINGS, BEATINGS, AND RAPES, AS WELL AS THE DEATHS OF </p><p>THE TWO WHITE FARMERS THE WEEK OF APRIL 16, AND GENERAL </p><p>INTIMIDATION OF FARM OWNERS BY THE OCCUPYING "WAR </p><p>VETERANS" AND THEIR HIRED BACKERS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR URGED THE GOVERNMENT TO ACT AGGRESSIVELY TO </p><p>STOP THE ESCALATING POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND TO UPHOLD LAW </p><p>AND ORDER BY ARRESTING AND PROSECUTING PERPETRATORS OF </p><p>THESE CRIMES.  SPECIFICALLY, THE AMBASSADOR INQUIRED </p><p>ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S RESPONSE TO THE PETROL BOMB </p><p>MURDERS OF TWO MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) </p><p>SUPPORTERS IN BUHERA ON APRIL 15 AND THE FATAL BEATINGS </p><p>OF TWO OTHER MDC SUPPORTERS IN KARIBA ON APRIL 25 </p><p>(REFTEL A).  THE AMBASSADOR INFORMED THE MINISTER THAT </p><p>HE HAD URGED PRESIDENT MUGABE TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE </p><p>IN STOPPING THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE (REFTEL B). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02297  01 OF 03  271542Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MINISTER DABENGWA RESPONDED BY EXPRESSING HIS </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE BREAKDOWN IN LAW AND ORDER, BUT WENT </p><p>ON TO SEPARATED THE VIOLENCE ON THE COMMERCIAL FARMS </p><p>FROM THE BROADER ELECTION-RELATED ASSAULTS AND DEATHS. </p><p>THE MINISTER WEAKLY ARGUED THAT THE OCCUPATIONS OF THE </p><p>FARMS BY WAR VETS AND OTHERS WERE THE RESULT OF A </p><p>LONGSTANDING POLITICAL PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY THAT </p><p>REQUIRED A "POLITICAL SOLUTION."  IN THE PAST, WHEN </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMS WERE OCCUPIED BY COMMUNAL FARMERS WHO </p><p>HAD GROWN IMPATIENT WAITING FOR LAND RESETTLEMENT, LOCAL </p><p>POLITICIANS WOULD BE DISPATCHED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>RESOLVE THE CRISIS AND NEGOTIATE A PEACEFUL REMOVAL. </p><p>THE POLICE HAVE NEVER EVICTED FARM OCCUPIERS BASED ONLY </p><p>ON A COURT ORDER, DABENGWA ADDED.  THE SAME STRATEGY IS </p><p>NOW BEING EMPLOYED TO NEGOTIATE A SOLUTION TO THE </p><p>OCCUPATIONS BY THE WAR VETS.  CONSEQUENTLY, NEITHER HIS </p><p>MINISTRY NOR THE POLICE WILL INTERFERE WITH THE </p><p>OCCUPIERS AS LONG AS THEY REMAIN PEACEFUL, I.E., IF THE </p><p>SQUATTERS REFRAINED FROM INTIMIDATION, PROPERTY DAMAGE, </p><p>OR PHYSICAL HARM TO THE RESIDENTS, THE MINISTER STATED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WHEN AMBASSADOR MCDONALD PRESSED THE MINISTER ON </p><p>POLICE FAILURE TO DO THEIR JOB OR TO DO SO IN A TIMELY </p><p>MANNER IN THE DEATHS OF THE TWO COMMERCIAL FARMERS OR IN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9918 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02297  02 OF 03  271543Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------50A4A4  271543Z /38 </p><p>P 271546Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5885 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 002297 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF A/S SUSAN RICE, DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p> </p><p>AF/S RENDER, BOOTH, GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR AFRICA GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02297  02 OF 03  271543Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/27/00 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, PINS, PINR, KDEM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR PUTS HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER ON NOTICE </p><p>TO STOP THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>OTHER CASES OF PHYSICAL ASSAULT ON BLACK FARM WORKERS, </p><p>THE MINISTER INSISTED THEY POLICE "DID THEIR BEST" IN </p><p>LIGHT OF THEIR TRANSPORT AND FORCE SIZE LIMITATIONS. </p><p>THE MINISTER\'S PERMANENT SECRETARY, TINAYE CHIGUDU, </p><p>CHIMED IN THAT WE DID NOT HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION AND </p><p>QUESTIONED WHETHER SOME OF THE INCIDENTS OCCURRED. </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD CUT CHIGUDU SHORT AND INSISTED THE </p><p>INFORMATION THE EMBASSY HAD WAS CREDIBLE.  DABENGWA SAID </p><p>THAT THE POLICE WERE INVESTIGATING THE TWO FARM DEATHS, </p><p>AND PROMISED TO SHARE THE REPORT WITH THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>WHEN COMPLETED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) DABENGWA RECOUNTED HOW HE HAD INITIALLY </p><p>INSTRUCTED THE POLICE TO REMOVE THE OCCUPIERS DURING THE </p><p>FIRST WEEKS OF THE COMMERCIAL FARM INVASIONS THREE </p><p>MONTHS AGO.  AT THAT TIME, HE SAID HE PERSONALLY TOLD </p><p>THE CHAIRMAN OF THE WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION, CHENJERI </p><p>"HITLER" HUNZVI, TO ORDER THE VETS TO VACATE THE FARMS. </p><p>HUNZVI WAS REPORTEDLY EN ROUTE TO AN OCCUPIED FARM TO </p><p>DELIVER THAT MESSAGE WHEN PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S </p><p>CONTRADICTORY INSTRUCTION THAT THE VETS COULD REMAIN </p><p>PEACEFULLY WAS BROADCAST OVER THE RADIO.  AT THAT POINT, </p><p>HUNZVI CEASED HIS EFFORTS TO HAVE THE VETS LEAVE THE </p><p>OCCUPIED FARMS.  THE MINISTER LAMENTED THAT HE DID NOT </p><p>HAVE A CHANCE TO CONSULT WITH THE PRESIDENT IN ADVANCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02297  02 OF 03  271543Z </p><p>OF MUGABE\'S STATEMENT, AS HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO TALK </p><p>HIM OUT OF TAKING SUCH A POSITION ON THE OCCUPATIONS, </p><p>DABENGWA SAID. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE MINISTER THEN DESCRIBED UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS </p><p>BY HIMSELF AND OTHER SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN THE </p><p>CABINET AND ZANU-PF POLITBURO TO END THE OCCUPATIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA\'S FLIP-FLOP ON THE </p><p>ISSUE.  NEVERTHELESS, THE ISSUE OF ESCALATING POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE CONTINUED TO BE DISCUSSED AMONG SENIOR </p><p>OFFICIALS, MOST RECENTLY IN THE APRIL 25 CABINET AND </p><p>POLITBURO MEETING.  DABENGWA NOTED THAT THE AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>MESSAGE ON THIS ISSUE TO THE PRESIDENT WAS THE MOST THAT </p><p>COULD BE DONE, AS MUGABE WAS INSISTING ON NO FORCED </p><p>REMOVALS.  THE MINISTER RESIGNEDLY SAID HIS HANDS WERE </p><p>TIED AS WERE THE POLICE, AS THERE WAS "NO POLITICAL </p><p>WILL" TO END THE OCCUPATIONS AT THE MOMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) TURNING TO THE ISSUE OF GENERAL ELECTION </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE, DABENGWA INSISTED THAT THE POLICE </p><p>WERE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND MAKING ARRESTS. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, THE MINISTER SAID HE HAD INSTRUCTED THE </p><p>POLICE COMMISSIONER TO PREPARE A WEEKLY SUMMARY OF </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE INCIDENTS, INCLUDING ARRESTS, WHICH </p><p>HE GAVE US A COPY OF DATED APRIL 16 TO 23.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THE REPORT MERELY CATALOGS THE NUMBER OF ZANU-PF AND </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY RALLIES, GENERICALLY IDENTIFIES ARRESTS </p><p>OF PARTY MEMBERS, AND DRYLY STATES THE NUMBER OF DEATHS. </p><p>THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF ANY ARREST IN CONNECTION WITH </p><p>THE FARM OR POLITICAL PARTY DEATHS SO FAR.  THERE ARE </p><p>ALSO NO NAMES OF SUSPECTS OR REFERENCE TO ANY POLICE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02297  02 OF 03  271543Z </p><p>FOLLOW-UP ACTION.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MINISTER DABENGWA INSISTS THAT THE LOCAL POLICE </p><p>AUTHORITIES WILL BE GIVEN COPIES OF THESE WEEKLY REPORTS </p><p>AND INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW-UP.  DABENGWA ALSO STATED THAT </p><p>A ZANU-PF SUPPORTER HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH </p><p>THE MURDERS OF THE TWO MDC SUPPORTERS IN BUHERA.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT THE POLICE SHOULD PUBLICIZE </p><p>ANY SUCH ARRESTS, AS THERE WAS CURRENTLY NO NEWS ON </p><p>POLICE EFFORTS TO END THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE, WHICH, IN </p><p>TURN, WAS ENCOURAGING MORE VIOLENCE.  DABENGWA SAID HE </p><p>INTENDS TO HAVE THE REPORTS OF VIOLENCE AND THE </p><p>SUBSEQUENT ARRESTS PUBLISHED IN THE NEWSPAPERS.  AT AN </p><p>MDC PRESS CONFERENCE ON APRIL 26, HOWEVER, MDC PRESIDENT </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI INSISTED THAT THE POLICE WERE NOT </p><p>INVESTIGATING THE ATTACKS ON MDC SUPPORTERS, AS THE </p><p>POLICE CLAIM TO BE UNDER INSTRUCTIONS THAT SUCH CRIMES </p><p>ARE "POLITICAL MATTERS" AND NOT APPROPRIATE FOR POLICE </p><p>INTERFERENCE.  THE AMBASSADOR CONCLUDED BY URGING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO ACT DECISIVELY TO END THE VIOLENCE ON THE </p><p>FARMS AND AMONG POLITICAL PARTY OPPONENTS, AND RETURN TO </p><p>AN ORDERLY LAND REFORM PROGRAM AS AGREED TO IN SEPTEMBER </p><p>1998 AT THE LAND CONFERENCE.  AMBASSADOR MCDONALD WENT </p><p>ON TO STATE THAT THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN THE RURAL </p><p>AREAS IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE WEAKEST GROUP, THE FARM </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9919 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02297  03 OF 03  271543Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-01 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------50A4AC  271543Z /38 </p><p>P 271546Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5886 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 002297 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF A/S SUSAN RICE, DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p> </p><p>AF/S RENDER, BOOTH, GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR AFRICA GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02297  03 OF 03  271543Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/27/00 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, PINS, PINR, KDEM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR PUTS HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER ON NOTICE </p><p>TO STOP THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>WORKERS, WHO ARE THE LEAST ABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT: THE ONGOING POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE IS DESIGNED TO SET THE STAGE FOR A ZANU-PF WIN </p><p>IN THE UPCOMING PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  THE BATTLE FOR </p><p>THE MAJORITY OF VOTES WILL PLAY OUT IN THE RURAL AREAS </p><p>(REFTEL C).  CONSEQUENTLY, MUGABE BELIEVES HE CAN WIN </p><p>ONLY IF HE CONTINUES ALLOWING ENOUGH INSTABILITY IN THE </p><p>RURAL AREAS TO ENSURE THAT AN INTIMATED ELECTORATE </p><p>STICKS WITH ZANU-PF.  NEITHER THE HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER </p><p>NOR OTHERS IN SENIOR GOVERNMENT POSITIONS ARE ABLE TO </p><p>INFLUENCE PRESIDENT MUGABE TO STOP THE ELECTION </p><p>VIOLENCE.  THOSE WHO PROFESS ABHORRENCE OF THE VIOLENCE, </p><p>LIKE DABENGWA, ARE EITHER TOO AFRAID FOR THEIR POLITICAL </p><p>CAREERS OR TOO WEAK TO HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE DEBATE. </p><p>MUGABE IS AGAIN CALLING ALL THE SHOTS AND NO ONE BELOW </p><p>HIM WILL TELL HIM JUST HOW DAMAGING THE VIOLENCE IS TO </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S STABILITY AND REPUTATION.  THERE IS A </p><p>CHANCE THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN DELEGATION WHICH IS PRESENTLY </p><p>IN LONDON TO DISCUSS RESUMPTION OF DIALOGUE WITH THE UK </p><p>ON LAND REFORM MAY GET A REALITY CHECK, BUT THE ODDS ARE </p><p>AGAINST ANY QUICK SHIFT IN THE CURRENT STRATEGY.  THE </p><p>ISSUE IS A CRITICAL ONE AND A MATTER OF BASIC HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS REGARDING WHICH WE WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OUT. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02297  03 OF 03  271543Z </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
