(C) DURING A FEBRUARY 22 PRIVATE AUDIENCE WITH THE POPE </p><p>AND SUBSEQUENT MEETING WITH VATICAN SECRETARY OF STATE </p><p>SODANO, UK PRIME MINISTER BLAIR OUTLINED TO THE HOLY SEE HIS </p><p>VIEWS ON THE NEED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DISARM </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN.  THE POPE AND HIS SENIOR ADVISORS REPORTEDLY </p><p>CONVEYED THEIR VIEW THAT DISARMAMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT </p><p>RECOURSE TO MILITARY ACTION.  BOTH SIDES AGREED ON THE </p><p>CENTRALITY OF THE UN\'S ROLE, THE IMPORTANCE OF RESOLVING THE </p><p>ISSUE OF IRAQ\'S POSSESSION OF WMD, AND THE NEED TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT THIS ISSUE DOES NOT LEAD TO NEW DIVISIONS IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>PRIVATE MEETING TURNED PUBLIC </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR MEET WITH THE POPE FOR A </p><p>HALF HOUR IN A PRIVATE AUDIENCE FEBRUARY 22, FOLLOWED BY AN </p><p>HOUR-LONG MEETING WITH VATICAN SECRETARY OF STATE SODANO AND </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER TAURAN.  BLAIR\'S PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE </p><p>POPE WAS NOT ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO BE SEEN AS A POLITICAL </p><p>MEETING, BUT RATHER A PRIVATE FAMILY VISIT.  (BLAIR\'S WIFE </p><p>AND CHILDREN ARE CATHOLIC, AND HAD WANTED TO MEET THE POPE.) </p><p>THE TIMING WAS DETERMINED NOT BY THE PRESSURE OVER IRAQ, BUT </p><p>BY THE COINCIDENCE OF A PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED MEETING IN ROME </p><p>WITH ITALIAN PM BERLUSCONI (REF C) AND THE BLAIR CHILDREN\'S </p><p>SCHOOL HOLIDAYS.  UK AMBASSADOR COLVIN (PROTECT) SAID THE UK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00806  01 OF 02  261603Z </p><p>AND HOLY SEE HAD AGREED THE BLAIR-POPE MEETING WOULD BE </p><p>PRIVATE WITHOUT THE CUSTOMARY POST-MEETING PRESS RELEASE. </p><p>THE HOLY SEE DID NOT HONOR THIS, HOWEVER, AS PAPAL SPOKESMAN </p><p>NAVARRO-VALLS PROVIDED THE PRESS WITH A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE </p><p>KEY POINTS OF THE TWO MEETINGS WITH "THE VATICAN\'S SPIN." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>IRAQ:  AVOID DIVISIONS; KEEP FOCUS ON UN </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN PRESS SUMMARY AND THE UK </p><p>AMBASSADOR, WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE SECOND MEETING, BUT NOT </p><p>THE PAPAL AUDIENCE, THE THREE AGREED SUBJECTS WERE IRAQ, THE </p><p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT, AND THE EU CONSTITUTION.  ON </p><p>IRAQ, THE AMBASSADOR SAID PM BLAIR LAID OUT HIS VIEWS -- </p><p>WHICH SHE SAID WOULD BE VERY FAMILIAR TO OUR EMBASSY IN </p><p>LONDON -- ON THE NEED TO DISARM SADDAM AND TO ENSURE THE UN </p><p>MET ITS RESPONSIBILITIES.  THE POPE AND HIS COLLABORATORS IN </p><p>TURN OUTLINED THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEW THAT "ALL INTERESTED </p><p>PARTIES IN THE IRAQI CRISIS NEED TO COLLABORATE WITH THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF THE UN AND KNOW HOW TO USE THE RESOURCES </p><p>OFFERED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW IN ORDER TO AVERT THE TRAGEDY OF </p><p>WAR," WHICH THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IS AVOIDABLE. </p><p>BOTH SIDES AGREED THAT THE UN ROLE SHOULD BE CENTRAL, BUT </p><p>DIFFERED OVER THE POTENTIAL NEED FOR RECOURSE TO FORCE IF </p><p>SADDAM FAILED TO COMPLY.  THE HOLY SEE ALSO EMPHASIZED TO </p><p>BLAIR ITS STANDARD VIEW THAT "SPECIAL CONSIDERATION" BE GIVEN </p><p>TO THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE, "ALREADY </p><p>SO SEVERELY TRIED BY THE LONG YEARS OF EMBARGO." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) WHAT WAS NEW IN THE HOLY SEE\'S PUBLIC PRESENTATION OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00806  01 OF 02  261603Z </p><p>THE ISSUE FOLLOWING THE MEETINGS WITH BLAIR WAS ITS CLEAR </p><p>RECOGNITION OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION IN IRAQ -- </p><p>WHICH WE HAVE HEARD PRIVATELY, BUT HAS BEEN MORE MUTED IN THE </p><p>VATICAN\'S PUBLIC TREATMENT OF IRAQ.  THIS WAS ALSO REFLECTED </p><p>IN THE HOLY SEE UN PERMREP\'S PRESENTATION BEFORE THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL IN WHICH HE OBSERVED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>IS "RIGHTLY WORRIED AND ADDRESSING A JUST AND URGENT CAUSE" </p><p>IN DISARMING ARSENALS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  THE SECOND NEW </p><p>ELEMENT WAS THE CONCERN EXPRESSED BY THE HOLY SEE ABOUT </p><p>ENSURING THAT IN DEALING WITH THE IRAQ CRISIS, "EVERY EFFORT </p><p>BE MADE TO AVOID NEW DIVISIONS IN THE WORLD."  THIS REFLECTS </p><p>THE VATICAN\'S CONCERN BOTH FOR POTENTIAL DIVISIONS BETWEEN </p><p>THE MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN WORLDS, AS WELL AS DIVISIONS WITHIN </p><p>THE WEST ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>NEED TO MOVE AHEAD ON ISRAEL-PALESTINE </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.

BOTH AGREED THAT THE ABSENCE OF SUCH PROGRESS </p><p>WOULD COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS ALL OTHER PROBLEMS IN THE </p><p>REGION, INCLUDING IRAQ.  BOTH ALSO AGREED THAT INTENSIFIED </p><p>EFFORTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF INJUSTICE AND POVERTY IN </p><p>PALESTINE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE BROADER EFFORT TO MINIMIZE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00806  02 OF 02  261603Z </p><p>NEW TERRORIST THREATS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>THE CHURCH IN THE EU CONSTITUTION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) REGARDING THE EU CONSTITUTION -- AN ISSUE THE POPE </p><p>RAISES WITH ALL EU MEMBERS AND PROSPECTIVE MEMBERS -- THE </p><p>POPE REITERATED HIS STRONG DESIRE THAT EXPLICIT RECOGNITION </p><p>BE GIVEN IN THE CONSTITUTION TO CHURCHES AND COMMUNITIES OF </p><p>BELIEVERS, AND THAT THE EU MAKE AN EXPLICIT COMMITMENT TO </p><p>MAINTAIN A STRUCTURED DIALOGUE WITH CHURCHES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>COMMENT:  VATICAN STEPPING UP THE DIPLOMATIC PACE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DESPITE THE PRIVATE ORIGINS AND NATURE OF THE VISIT, </p><p>THE MEDIA HAS SEIZED ON THE VISIT -- WITH ENCOURAGEMENT FROM </p><p>THE HOLY SEE -- AS A REFLECTION OF THE POPE\'S CONTINUING </p><p>CENTRAL ROLE AS A SOURCE OF MORAL INFLUENCE ON THE CURRENT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DEBATE OVER IRAQI DISARMAMENT.  BLAIR\'S VISIT </p><p>FOLLOWED CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF PAPAL AUDIENCES WITH KOFI </p><p>ANNAN, TARIQ AZIZ (REF B), AND JOSCHKA FISCHER, AS WELL AS </p><p>CARDINAL ETCHEGARAY\'S MEETING WITH SADDAM (REF A), AND IT </p><p>PRECEDES VISITS THIS WEEK OF SPANISH PRIME MINISTER AZNAR AND </p><p>IRAN\'S  PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER MOHAMMED REZA KHATAMI.  THE </p><p>POPE\'S TOP OFFICIALS ALSO CLOSETED WITH ITALIAN PRESIDENT </p><p>CIAMPI AND PM BERLUSCONI FEBRUARY 17 IN AN ANNUAL MEETING IN </p><p>WHICH IRAQ WAS A MAIN TOPIC OF CONVERSATION.  AS THEY HAVE </p><p>POINTED OUT TO US, (REFS A AND B), THE VATICAN ACKNOWLEDGES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00806  02 OF 02  261603Z </p><p>THE RIGHTNESS OF OUR CAUSE IN DEALING WITH SADDAM\'S WMD AND </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGES THEIR DANGER, BUT CANNOT YET BRING ITSELF TO </p><p>ACCEPT THAT RESORT TO FORCE IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD.  THIS </p><p>REFLECTS BOTH A WIDELY ACCEPTED VIEW WITHIN SOME CHURCH </p><p>CIRCLES THAT WAR IS AN IMMORAL AND INEFFECTIVE MEANS TO </p><p>RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS, AND MORE PRAGMATIC CONCERNS </p><p>FOR THE IMPACT OF WAR ON CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM RELATIONS IN </p><p>GENERAL AND ON CATHOLIC POPULATIONS IN MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN </p><p>PARTICULAR. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) IN PURSUING ITS ACTIVIST DIPLOMATIC AGENDA, THE </p><p>VATICAN IS SEEKING TO USE THE FULL FORCE OF ITS MORAL </p><p>MEGAPHONE TO ADVANCE ITS VIEW THAT IRAQ\'S THREATS CAN BE </p><p>ADDRESSED SHORT OF WAR.  BLAIR\'S MEETING AND THAT OF AZNAR </p><p>FEBRUARY 27 WILL HELP TO EMPHASIZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE </p><p>HOLY SEE SHARES OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE THREAT POSED BY </p><p>SADDAM, WHILE ALSO MAKING CLEAR THE NEED FOR THE UN TO MEET </p><p>ITS RESPONSIBILITIES.  IN THE WAKE OF THIS HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY, WE HAVE NOTED INCREASING CONCERNS BEING </p><p>EXPRESSED ABOUT THE U.S. "NEGLECTING" OR "UNDERVALUING" THE </p><p>MORAL INFLUENCE OF THE POPE.  WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT A </p><p>SENIOR LEVEL MEETING WITH THE HOLY SEE WOULD ALLOW US TO </p><p>OVERCOME THE WIDESPREAD MEDIA IMAGE OF THE U.S. AND HOLY SEE </p><p>AT ODDS OVER IRAQ BY EMPHASIZING OUR SHARED CONCERN OVER </p><p>SADDAM\'S POSSESSION OF WMD, OUR SHARED COMMITMENT TO WORKING </p><p>WITH AND SUPPORTING THE UN, AND OUR SHARED CONCERN FOR THE </p><p>IRAQI PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00806  02 OF 02  261603Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA00806 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
