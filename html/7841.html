Between 26 and 29 April, DART Field Team West traveled </p><p>more than 1,400 km inside Iraq conducting an assessment of </p><p>communities in the western governorate of Al Anbar.  The </p><p>DART conducted assessments in Ar Rutbah, Hadithah, Anah, and </p><p>Heet.  The DART also stopped in Baghdad to talk with some </p><p>community members.  Due to security concerns, the DART was </p><p>unable to assess either Ar Ramadi, the governorate\'s largest </p><p>population center, or the community of Al Qa\'im, on the </p><p>Syrian border. </p><p> </p><p>2.  In general, the DART found conditions in the communities </p><p>assessed to be near pre-war levels in the areas of water and </p><p>sanitation, food, and health.  The exception remains Ar </p><p>Rutbah, although problems there could be addressed for the </p><p>immediate term with a few targeted interventions.  The DART </p><p>has already begun working with cooperative agreement </p><p>partners to design appropriate interventions.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  With the exception of Ar Rutbah, health facilities in </p><p>communities assessed were functioning close to pre-war </p><p>levels.  Staff have returned to work (in some cases never </p><p>leaving), facilities were undamaged and protected from </p><p>looting by the communities, and supplies of emergency </p><p>medical supplies are sufficient for the near-term.  These </p><p>facilities will require re-supply within the coming 30 days. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Ar Rutbah is the exception to this.  The hospital in Ar </p><p>Rutbah was destroyed by Coalition bombing.  Health services </p><p>are now being offered in the town\'s primary health clinic, </p><p>but this space is inadequate to provide the level of service </p><p>previously offered in this remote region\'s only hospital. </p><p>The DART is working with World Vision International to </p><p>design a short-term intervention to address this need. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>5.  The DART found that the public distribution system (PDS) </p><p>is functioning and wakils (PDS agents) are present and </p><p>working in all communities assessed.  All wakils had their </p><p>beneficiary lists intact.  Food stocks are considered </p><p>adequate, and in some towns food deliveries from Ar Ramadi </p><p>and ration distributions have resumed.  Markets were open in </p><p>all towns visited.  Vegetables, meats, and starches are </p><p>generally available.  The DART visited one flour mill that </p><p>is fully operational.  The mill manager informed team that </p><p>all four mills in Al Anbar are operating at pre-war levels. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>WATER AND SANITATION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  With the exception of Ar Rutbah, water and sewage </p><p>service in all communities assessed has returned to pre-war </p><p>levels.  Even in Ar Rutbah, where most residents rely on </p><p>septic tanks, sewage services have returned to pre-war </p><p>levels. </p><p> </p><p>7.  In Ar Rutbah, normal water-in-house service has yet to </p><p>be restored.   Water is being tankered to residences from </p><p>deep water wells approximately 15 kilometers (KM) from town. </p><p>This water is not being treated prior to distribution. </p><p>Again, immediate emergency needs in water could be addressed </p><p>in the short-term by a few targeted interventions.  The DART </p><p>has begun discussions with CARE to potentially design an </p><p>intervention to address immediate water needs. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  One of the primary concerns of residents in Al Anbar </p><p>remains security.  In fact, the lack of security prevented </p><p>the DART from visiting Al Qa\'im and Ar Ramadi.  DART </p><p>departed the village of Anah before completing its </p><p>assessment due to security concerns. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Police have resumed work in all of the towns assessed; </p><p>however, their presence is low and their ability to maintain </p><p>law and order appears minimal.  Local residents reported </p><p>that they continue to feel unsafe.  Things appear more </p><p>stable where there is a Coalition presence such as in Ar </p><p>Rutbah and Hadithah.  The DART also found that many </p><p>interviewees remained uncomfortable in talking to the team. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Telephone service remains inoperable in most areas of </p><p>Al Anbar.  Some towns (Hadithah and Anah) have local phone </p><p>service, but they cannot make calls to neighboring </p><p>communities.  Officials from local governorate services such </p><p>as health and school officials have not been in contact with </p><p>the governorate\'s administrative headquarters in Ar Ramadi. </p><p>Schools have not re-opened despite a local willingness due </p><p>in part to the lack of instruction from national or </p><p>governorate level officials.  Health officials are unable to </p><p>communicate with Ar Ramadi.  When they refer patients to Ar </p><p>Ramadi for treatment, they must give instruction to </p><p>ambulance drivers as they cannot speak directly to Ar Ramadi </p><p>health officials.  They also have no idea when their supply </p><p>chain will resume, or if things will continue to function as </p><p>they did in the past. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The lack of communication is also a concern to people </p><p>that are unsure of the well-being of family members in other </p><p>parts of the country.  Some are looking for relatives who </p><p>were in the military, and are unaware of the status of their </p><p>loved ones.  Others are simply hoping to make contact with </p><p>family members in other parts of the country. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  Western Iraq is served by a well-maintained road </p><p>network.  Highway 10 leading from the Jordanian border to </p><p>Baghdad is a six-lane divided highway.  Highway 12 leading </p><p>northwest from near Ar Ramadi toward the Syrian border is a </p><p>two-lane highway that is in good condition. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Coalition bombing destroyed some of the bridges on </p><p>Highway 12.  Detours have been cleared and all forms of </p><p>vehicles are currently able to transit this corridor. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Coalition bombing also partially destroyed one bridge </p><p>and one over-pass on Highway 10.  The bridge (near Rutbah) </p><p>has been reduced to one-lane traffic.  No by-pass has been </p><p>developed.  This will become a significant problem as </p><p>traffic, including the flow of oil tankers to Jordan and </p><p>humanitarian relief (in particular the World Food Program), </p><p>increases.  The destroyed over-pass has rendered the </p><p>eastbound lanes of Highway 10 impassable.  No detour has </p><p>been developed and the intermediate solution is two-way </p><p>traffic on the normal westbound lanes for a couple of </p><p>kilometers. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  The presence of unexploded ordnance (UXO) is a </p><p>significant problem in two of the communities that the DART </p><p>visited.  Hadithah was the site of a large Iraqi military </p><p>base, and was the scene of a major battle between Coalition </p><p>and Iraqi forces.  As a result, the area is strewn with </p><p>UXOs, weapons, and other military equipment.  Coalition </p><p>forces in the area have been active in locating and </p><p>destroying UXOs, weapons, and equipment.  Nevertheless, this </p><p>remains a problem that will exist for some time.  As of 28 </p><p>April, four people had been injured as a result of UXOs in </p><p>the town. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Ar Rutbah has a similar problem.  The Iraqi military </p><p>abandoned stocks of UXOs, and Coalition military action left </p><p>more UXOs scattered about the town.  The current Coalition </p><p>presence is not equipped to address the UXO problem in Ar </p><p>Rutbah.  To date, 12 individuals have been seriously injured </p><p>in incidents involving UXOs in the town.  U.N. Mine Action </p><p>Service has visited Ar Rutbah and has plans to return.  In </p><p>addition, the Coalition forces present in Ar Rutbah have </p><p>requested an ordnance disposal team, but there is no firm </p><p>date for the arrival of such a team.  Team West is working </p><p>with World Vision to incorporate UXO awareness and education </p><p>activities into its future activities in Ar Rutbah. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>COOKING FUEL </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>17.  One consistent problem in all of the towns visited by </p><p>the DART was the shortage of cooking fuel.  Many residents </p><p>had stockpiled propane and kerosene based on their </p><p>experiences following the 1991 conflict.  But those stocks </p><p>are running low, and normal re-supply of fuel from Ar Ramadi </p><p>and Baghdad has not resumed.  In some villages residents </p><p>reported that kerosene was still available in the local </p><p>markets, while in others residents report that they have </p><p>begun using wood and charcoal for cooking. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SCHOOLS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  The DART spoke to school officials and teachers in </p><p>almost all of the villages assessed.  In those towns where </p><p>the team did not speak directly to school officials, it did </p><p>question residents about the conditions of schools. </p><p>Consistently, the DART was informed that most schools were </p><p>ready to reopen, that students were ready to return, and </p><p>that most teachers were anxious to get started.  Some </p><p>teachers (Ba\'ath party members) are reportedly apprehensive </p><p>about returning, but remain in town. </p><p> </p><p>19.  In every case, officials and residents alike reported </p><p>that they are simply awaiting instruction on what to do. </p><p>They have heard rumors that schools should not open for </p><p>three months (some said six months).  This troubles them </p><p>because most want to get back to life as normal, and having </p><p>schools open would be a significant step forward in this </p><p>respect.  (Note: Coalition forces in Ar Rutbah are working </p><p>closely with local officials to get schools open in that </p><p>town.  End note.)   The lack of communication with officials </p><p>in Ar Ramadi and Baghdad is certainly adding to the problem. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>MISCELLANEOUS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  A growing concern is the issue of salaries for civil </p><p>servants.  People are very insecure and uncertain about when </p><p>and how they are going to be compensated for their work. </p><p>They are being instructed to keep track of their hours as </p><p>they always have so that they can be compensated when a new </p><p>government is in place. </p><p> </p><p>21.  Fuel supplies (gas and diesel) are running low in these </p><p>communities.  It is still available (sometimes only on the </p><p>black market), but prices have more than doubled in many </p><p>cases.  Again, there is a general sense of uncertainty </p><p>surrounding when things will return to normal.  For example, </p><p>"when will the gas station have gas again and at what </p><p>price?" </p><p> </p><p>22.  However, in some ways, life is coming back to the </p><p>country.  Traffic on Highway 10 is picking up in the </p><p>direction of Baghdad.  The line to cross the border from </p><p>Jordan into Iraq is growing longer and longer.  Families are </p><p>moving back, cars stacked high with suitcases, extra fuel, </p><p>and satellite dishes, hundreds of which are pouring into </p><p>Iraq from Jordan.  The DART observed several cars carrying </p><p>up to ten satellite dishes on the roof as well as buses </p><p>carrying several stacks of ten dishes each.  The DART also </p><p>saw two trucks transporting approximately 20 cars into Iraq </p><p>for sale -- a sign that someone has growing confidence in </p><p>security along that road. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
