<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000804 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PGOV, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MORE TRAFFIC MOVING, BUSINESSES OPEN IN STRIKE\'S </p><p>SECOND DAY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 795 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 753 </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  More traffic was moving and shops open on </p><p>the second day of the general strike called by Maoist </p><p>insurgents April 23-27.  One mini-bus was torched inside </p><p>Kathmandu after a crowd attacked it; no injuries were </p><p>reported.  In districts outside Kathmandu Maoists hijacked </p><p>four ambulances; set fire to the country home of the Prime </p><p>Minister, and killed two Armed Police Force policemen in an </p><p>ambush April 23.  The Government of Nepal announced rewards </p><p>for information leading to the capture of the top Maoist </p><p>leadership.  A core EAC met at COB April 24 to assess the </p><p>situation and determine  actions for the following day.  The </p><p>international school, which most Mission dependent children </p><p>attend, as well as the French and British schools, will </p><p>remain closed April 25.  Absent any violent incidents in the </p><p>intervening hours, we expect observation of the strike to </p><p>fall even more steeply on the third day, as </p><p>people--especially at the lower end of the economic </p><p>scale--begin to feel the pinch. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>VOLUME OF TRAFFIC, BUSINESS SOMEWHAT HIGHER </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Considerably more shops--an estimated 35 percent of </p><p>the total--were open and vehicles moving in Kathmandu on the </p><p>second day of the Maoists\' strike, or "bandh," called for </p><p>April 23-27.  Most drivers of non-official vehicles, </p><p>including public transportation such as buses and taxis, </p><p>followed Government of Nepal (GON) advice and taped over or </p><p>otherwise obscured their license plates to avoid retribution. </p><p> At COB April 24 the RSO had received reports of only two </p><p>violent incidents within the city limits:  the bombing of a </p><p>small shop  and the torching (after the passengers alighted) </p><p>of a mini-bus by an angry crowd.  No injuries were reported </p><p>in either incident. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>FURTHER INCIDENTS: </p><p>DAY ONE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In addition to the incidents reported Ref A, on the </p><p>first day of the strike Maoists set fire to the country home </p><p>of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in Dadeldhura District </p><p>in the far-western region of the country.  Deuba and his </p><p>family were in Kathmandu at the time of the incident, and no </p><p>injuries were reported.  (Note:  The incident follows the </p><p>April 20 bombing of the country home of Finance Minister Ram </p><p>Sharan Mahat in Nuwakot District.  Mahat and his family were </p><p>in Kathmandu at the time.  End note.)  Maoists also </p><p>reportedly hijacked four ambulances that had been returning </p><p>from Kathmandu via a major highway near the Chitwan-Dhading </p><p>border April 23.  Press reports said the police had </p><p>successfully reclaimed the ambulances, but the local director </p><p>of the Nepal Red Cross Society, which owned three of the four </p><p>vehicles, said his organization had not yet recovered them. </p><p>In a separate incident about noon the same day, an Armed </p><p>Police Force (APF) contingent providing a security escort for </p><p>a passenger bus came under attack in Majhintar, Dhading </p><p>District.  Two APF policemen were killed. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>WANTED:  DEAD OR ALIVE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) In an unprecedented move, on April 23 the GON </p><p>announced cash rewards equivalent to about USD 65,000 for </p><p>individuals that hand over to the security forces either of </p><p>the Maoists\' top three leaders:  Prachanda, Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai, and Mohan Vaidya. Those providing information </p><p>leading to the arrest of those leaders will receive half of </p><p>the reward.  Individuals handing over certain members of the </p><p>second-tier leadership, including former negotiator Krishna </p><p>Bahadur Mahara, will net a reward equivalent to USD 45,000. </p><p>Those turning in Central Committee members earn a reward </p><p>equivalent to USD 32,000.  Lesser amounts will be given to </p><p>individuals who turn over certain weapons believed to have </p><p>been stolen from the security forces by the Maoists.  The </p><p>announcement, issued by Police Headquarters and featured </p><p>widely in the local press, noted that the wanted individuals </p><p>may </p><p>be turned over "dead or alive." </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>EMBASSY ACTIONS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) A core EAC met at COB April 24 to assess the </p><p>situation and determine actions for day three of the strike. </p><p>It was decided, as in the previous two days, that the Embassy </p><p>will operate under normal working hours, although FSN </p><p>shuttles will depart one hour earlier in the late afternoon. </p><p>The management of the international school, which most </p><p>Mission dependent children attend, as well as that of the </p><p>French and British schools, have decided their institutions </p><p>will remain closed on April 25. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Adherence to the bandh, at least in the city, </p><p>appears to be gradually eroding.  Absent any violent </p><p>incidents in the intervening hours, we expect observation of </p><p>the strike to fall even more steeply on the third day, as </p><p>people--especially at the lower end of the economic </p><p>scale--begin to feel the pinch.  The rewards announced </p><p>represent a substantial sum of money by virtually any </p><p>Nepali\'s standard, and are sure to catch the attention of the </p><p>general public.  The GON has only recently begun to publish </p><p>the names and photographs of its "most wanted"--the top </p><p>Maoist leadership--in the local press.  Dissemination of the </p><p>photographs have reportedly led to at least two arrests (Ref </p><p>B) already; whether the stepped-up publicity and the rewards </p><p>announcement result in further arrests remains to be seen. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
