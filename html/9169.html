<p>S E C R E T ROME 003045 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, MNUC, KNNP, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY FLAGS DISCUSSION POINTS FOR PSI BRISBANE </p><p>    MEETINGS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) STATE 189947 </p><p>     B. B) 02 ROME 6158 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASO </p><p>NS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S)  POST CONVEYED REFTEL LETTER TO PAOLO CUCULI IN THE </p><p>MFA DISARMAMENT OFFICE ON JULY 2.  CUCULI WILL ACCOMPANY </p><p>FILIPPO FORMICA, THE DIRECTOR OF THE DISARMAMENT OFFICE, TO </p><p>THE JULY 9-10 MEETINGS IN AUSTRALIA AND IS INVOLVED IN </p><p>PREPARING ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTIONS ON THE PROLIFERATION SECURITY </p><p>INITIATIVE (PSI).  (NOTE: FORMICA IS OUT OF ROME UNTIL JULY </p><p>4. AMB. ARAGONA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE BRISBANE </p><p>MEETING BECAUSE OF EU PRESIDENCY-RELATED DUTIES IN ROME. </p><p>FORMICA AND THE REST OF ITALY\'S DELEGATION WILL DEPART FOR </p><p>AUSTRALIA ON JULY 7.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) CUCULI FLAGGED THREE POINTS IN PARTICULAR THAT HE SAID </p><p>WERE DISCUSSED DURING A GOI INTERAGENCY MEETING TO REVIEW THE </p><p>RULES OF THE ROAD.  HE EXPECTS THESE ISSUES WILL ALSO BE </p><p>RAISED IN BRISBANE.  FIRST, ANY MEASURES WILL NEED TO BE </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH EU COMMON REGULATIONS, ESPECIALLY WHERE THE </p><p>EC ALREADY HAS AN EXCLUSIVE LEGISLATIVE COMPETENCE </p><p>(TRANSPORT, FOREIGN TRADE).  SECOND, BLACKLISTING COUNTRIES </p><p>AND NON-STATE PROLIFERATORS RATHER THAN TYPES OF ILLICIT </p><p>BEHAVIOR MAY RUN CONTRARY TO ITALIAN AND EU LEGISLATION. </p><p>LISTS OF COUNTRIES SANCTIONED BY A UN OR EU EMBARGO CURRENTLY </p><p>ARE THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>    3. (S) THE THIRD POINT RELATES TO A DRAFT TECHNICAL AGREEMENT </p><p>THE GOI PROPOSED IN 2002 (REFTEL B) IN RESPONSE TO THE USG\'S </p><p>OVERTURES FOR INCREASED COOPERATION ON MARITIME INTERCEPT </p><p>OPERATIONS (MIOS).  THE BILATERAL AGREEMENT WOULD CREATE A </p><p>RECIPROCAL INFORMATION-EXCHANGE MECHANISM AND WOULD </p><p>STREAMLINE THE PROCEDURE FOR BOARDING SHIPS FLYING THE OTHER </p><p>COUNTRY\'S FLAG IN NON-TERRITORIAL WATERS.  (TEXT OF THE </p><p>AGREEMENT WAS FAXED TO EUR/WE ON 12/30/02).  THE GOI CRAFTED </p><p>THE AGREEMENT AS A MEANS OF ADDRESSING THE SOVEREIGNTY </p><p>CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVED IN ALLOWING NON-ITALIAN SHIPS TO </p><p>STOP, SEARCH AND SEIZE ITALIAN VESSELS.  ITALY NOW IS </p><p>SUGGESTING THAT PSI COUNTRIES MAY WISH TO CONSIDER SOMETHING </p><p>SIMILAR AMONG LIKE-MINDED STATES AS A WAY TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>INTERDICTION COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) A READ-OUT WE RECEIVED OF THE GOI INTERAGENCY MEETING </p><p>NOTED THAT ITALIAN LAW PERMITS ITALIAN MILITARY, POLICE AND </p><p>SECURITY FORCES TO INTERDICT ILLEGAL TRAFFICKING IN WMD AND </p><p>RELATED MATERIALS THAT OCCURS WITHIN ITALIAN TERRITORY, </p><p>TERRITORIAL WATERS AND NATIONAL AIRSPACE, REGARDLESS OF THE </p><p>FLAG OF THE SUSPECTED VESSEL OR AIRCRAFT.  THE ITALIAN NAVY </p><p>ALSO IS AUTHORIZED TO STOP, SEARCH AND SEIZE SUSPECTED </p><p>ITALIAN VESSELS IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS.  IN ADDITION TO THE </p><p>DRAFT TECHNICAL AGREEMENT DISCUSSED ABOVE, CUCULI SAID THE </p><p>GOI IS STUDYING OTHER OPTIONS FOR BOARDINGS OF ITALIAN </p><p>VESSELS BY PSI PARTNER COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS BOARDINGS OF </p><p>NON-ITALIAN VESSELS IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS BY ITALIAN AND </p><p>OTHER PSI PARTNER COUNTRIES.  FORMICA AND HIS DELEGATION WILL </p><p>BE PREPARED TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES AT THE BRISBANE MEETINGS </p><p>NEXT WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>    5. (S) POST DELIVERED USG INPUT FOR BRISBANE MEETING RECEIVED </p><p>BY E-MAIL ON JUNE 3 TO CUCULI. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03045 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
