<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 000042 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY VIENNA FOR BOSNIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, HR, BK, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFSROL:  BOBAN DENIED VISA TO AUSTRALIA; </p><p>          GOC ASKS WHETHER U.S. WILL LET HIM IN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SEE ACTION PARAGRAPH 4. </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN A JANUARY 4 MEETING FOREIGN MINISTER MATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00042  041835Z </p><p>GRANIC TOLD AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH THAT THE PLANNED </p><p>"LONG VACATION" TO AUSTRALIA BY THE "PRESIDENT" OF </p><p>THE SO-CALLED "REPUBLIC OF HERCEG-BOSNA," MATE BOBAN, </p><p>HAD BEEN CANCELLED BECAUSE BOBAN HAD BEEN DENIED A </p><p>VISA.  WE LATER CONTACTED THE AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY IN </p><p>VIENNA AND WERE TOLD BY FIRST SECRETARY MARK HIGGIE </p><p>THAT BOBAN HAD BEEN DESIGNATED A "CONTROVERSIAL </p><p>VISITOR" BY THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC </p><p>AFFAIRS ON THE BASIS THAT HIS VISIT "DID NOT MEET </p><p>PUBLIC INTEREST CRITERIA."  SPECIFICALLY, HIGGIE SAID </p><p>THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FELT THAT BOBAN\'S </p><p>VISIT COULD POTENTIALLY UPSET ETHNIC SERBS AND </p><p>MUSLIMS FROM THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA CURRENTLY RESIDING </p><p>IN AUSTRALIA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  HIGGIE STATED THAT VISAS HAD BEEN DENIED ON </p><p>SIMILAR GROUNDS TO DOBROSLAV PARAGA, PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>CROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHTS, AND BOSNIAN SERB "VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT" BILJANA PLAVSIC.  HE ADDED THAT THE VISA </p><p>TO BOBAN WAS DENIED, IN PART, TO BALACE THE EARLIER </p><p>REFUSAL OF PLAVSIC.  HE ALSO COMMENTED THAT HAD BOBAN </p><p>APPLIED A YEAR EARLIER, BEFORE THE MUSLIM-CROAT </p><p>CONFLICT AND ENSUING VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, HIS </p><p>APPLICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN FAVORABLY RECEIVED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACTION REQUEST:  GRANIC SAID THAT BOBAN STILL </p><p>HOPED TO VISIT THE U.S. FOR HIS "LONG VACATION."  HE </p><p>ASKED, "OFF THE RECORD" WHETHER WE COULD TELL HIM </p><p>"OFF THE RECORD" WHETHER THE VISA APPLICATION WOULD </p><p>BE FAVORABLY RECEIVED.  NOTE:  BOBAN WAS GIVEN AN A-1 </p><p>TDY VISA WITH 12 MONTHS VALIDITY LAST FEBRUARY TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00042  041835Z </p><p>ATTEND THE PEACE TALKS IN NEW YORK.  PLEASE PROVIDE </p><p>GUIDANCE FOR OUR REPLY TO GRANIC. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  WHEN WE WERE FIRST INFORMED BY FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER GRANIC THAT BOBAN WOULD BE TAKING A "LONG </p><p>VACATION," THE IMPLICATION WAS THAT THIS WAS PART OF </p><p>AN EFFORT TO GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY AND, COMBINED </p><p>WITH THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL FOR </p><p>"HERCEG-BOSNA," PERHAPS PART OF AN EFFORT TO EASE HIM </p><p>OUT OF THE PICTURE ENTIRELY.  WE ALSO NOTE THAT </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER GRANIC WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>BOSNIAN CROAT LEADERS AKMADZIC AND TOMIC (WHOSE STARS </p><p>APPEAR TO BE RISING) AT THE TALKS IN VIENNA WITH B-H </p><p>PRIME MINISTER SALAJDZIC. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT BOBAN </p><p>MIGHT AT SOME POINT BE TRIED FOR WAR CRIMES ALTHOUGH </p><p>WE HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER AT THE PRESENT TIME </p><p>SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE EXISTS TO MAKE THE CASE AGAINST </p><p>HIM.  WE BELIEVE THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND HERE </p><p>COULD BE IMPROVED IF ANOTHER "VACATION SITE" WERE </p><p>FOUND FOR MR. BOBAN.  AUSTRALIA WAS AN IDEAL </p><p>DESTINATION, BEING AT LEAST 48 AIR HOURS AWAY AND </p><p>WITH A SUBSTANTIAL TIME DIFFERENCE BUT WE NOTE THAT </p><p>THERE ARE REMOTE PARTS OF THE U.S. AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
