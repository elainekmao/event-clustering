Please provide a short evaluative narrative of host </p><p>government commitment to fiscal transparency and </p><p>accountability. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Answer: The GON has a stated commitment to budget </p><p>transparency. In his message to the National Assembly </p><p>accompanying the 2003 budget proposal, President Obasanjo </p><p>pledged the following: &Continued emphasis on allocative </p><p>efficiency by ensuring value for money in Federal Government </p><p>expenditure and ensuring execution follows rules of fiscal </p><p>transparency at all levels.8 To date, publicly available </p><p>information on the 2003 budget proposal includes no details. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The 2002 budget, including details, was made widely available </p><p>in early 2002, but information on how that budget was </p><p>actually implemented is lacking. The Office of the Accountant </p><p>General of the Federation claims that it publishes a monthly </p><p>cash flow statement on a website (www.oagf.gov.ng) showing </p><p>consolidated revenues and expenditures. However, Post has </p><p>been unable to locate the website or obtain a copy of such a </p><p>statement from the Accountant General, and Post is unaware of </p><p>any other publicly available documents that reconcile the </p><p>budget with actual expenditure. </p><p>A due diligence unit has been established in the Office of </p><p>the President to vet budget expenditures on major </p><p>government-funded contracts to ensure that expenditures are </p><p>in line with prevailing international rates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Auditor General of the Federation in early 2003 provided </p><p>the National Assembly with a report on 2001 fiscal year that </p><p>was critical of some Ministries. The Acting Auditor General </p><p>who submitted the report was replaced under ambiguous </p><p>circumstances. In early May 2003, the outgoing Senate </p><p>announced it would hold public hearings on the report\'s </p><p>findings, but it is unclear whether these hearings will </p><p>continue when new members take office at the end of May. </p><p>In 2002, the National Assembly considered but did not pass a </p><p>fiscal responsibility bill that would more clearly spell out </p><p>the steps the GON must take to ensure transparency and </p><p>accountability of public expenditure. A procurement reform </p><p>bill was also introduced but not passed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>N. Please list U.S. government-sponsored programs and </p><p>activities that promote accurate disclosure of revenues and </p><p>expenditures in the national budgets of your host country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Answer: USG Assistance to the GON in fiscal transparency </p><p>since the return to democracy in 1999 has included the </p><p>following: </p><p>--Supporting the Budget Office of the Federation to improve </p><p>development and execution of the Federal budget in a more </p><p>transparent manner; </p><p>--Assisting &due process8 examination of the capital budget </p><p>by Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit; </p><p>--Supporting development of a best-practices Public </p><p>Procurement Law, which is awaiting legislative passage, and </p><p>of a Public Procurement Procedures Manual, which can be </p><p>employed once the enabling legislation is passed; </p><p>--Assisting the Debt Management Office to track and manage </p><p>Federal domestic debt; and </p><p>--Parallel financing (with World Bank, U.K. Department for </p><p>International Development, and the European Union) of an </p><p>Economic Management Capacity Building Project. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
