Nong Duc Manh, Communist Party of </p><p>Vietnam (CPV) General Secretary (GS), visited the PRC April </p><p>7 - 11.  This was his second visit to the PRC since assuming </p><p>these responsibilities in April 2001.  GS Manh was </p><p>apparently the first foreign leader to meet with the PRC\'s </p><p>new leadership.  The visit was described as a "working </p><p>visit" and both sides used it especially to give a push to </p><p>the economic relationship.  While Manh was visiting the PRC, </p><p>Prime Minister Phan Van Khai was meeting with his </p><p>counterpart in Japan (ref a).  Officials discounted the </p><p>significance of the timing, however.  The visit, the latest </p><p>in the steady flow of high-level exchanges characterizing </p><p>the bilateral relationship, broke no new ground, but </p><p>"reaffirmed" earlier agreements, including the Land Border </p><p>treaty and Tonkin Gulf agreement.  The two sides reportedly </p><p>made some progress on outstanding fisheries issues, but </p><p>there was disappointment on the Vietnamese side on the lack </p><p>of progress on the land border demarcation.  Reportedly, </p><p>there was some divergence regarding Iraq.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  According to press reports, a number of high-level </p><p>CPV and GVN officials accompanied Manh on his visit, </p><p>including: </p><p>--Deputy Prime Minister (and former Minister of Trade) Vu </p><p>Khoan (also head of the CPV Politburo Secretariat); </p><p>--CPV Central Committee member and director of the Central </p><p>Committee\'s External Relations Department Nguyen Van Son; </p><p>--CPV Central Committee member and Director of the CPV </p><p>Central Committee office Ngo Van Du; </p><p>--CPV Central Committee member and Director of the CPV </p><p>Central Committee Office Ho Tien Nghi; </p><p>--Ministry of Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Le Van Bang; </p><p>and, </p><p>--Vietnam\'s Ambassador to the PRC Tran Van Luat. </p><p>(Note:  Khoan, Son, Du, and Nghi also accompanied GS Manh on </p><p>his previous visit to the PRC - ref b - End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>A "WORKING VISIT" </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  According to the PRC embassy, the main reasons </p><p>for GS Manh\'s visit were to: (1) meet the new PRC </p><p>leadership; (2) "learn from the experience" of the PRC\'s </p><p>16th Party Congress; and, (3) exchange views on bilateral </p><p>cooperation and various regional and international issues. </p><p>Nguyen Vinh Quang, Acting Director General of the Department </p><p>for China and Northeast Asia of the CPV Central Committee\'s </p><p>Commission for External Affairs, told poloff on April 16 </p><p>that, while GS Manh\'s trip was considered a "working visit" </p><p>rather than an "official friendship visit," this did not </p><p>make much difference in the substance of the meetings. </p><p>Quang said that in a "working visit" fewer officials </p><p>accompanied Manh and there were less formal protocol </p><p>arrangements.  Quang said that in addition to his party </p><p>counterpart Hu Jintao, Manh met with other key PRC leaders, </p><p>including Wu Bangguo, Chairman of the Standing Committee of </p><p>the National People\'s Congress; Wen Jiabao, CCP Politburo </p><p>standing committee member and Premier; Jiang Zemin, Chairman </p><p>of the Central Military Commission and former CCP General </p><p>Secretary; Vice President Zeng Qinghong; and Chairman of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>China\'s People\'s Consultative Political Conference Jia </p><p>Qinglin.  There were apparently no public events, but GS </p><p>Manh\'s visit did include stops in Anhui and Yunnan </p><p>provinces, where he met with local leaders and had a chance </p><p>to see the impact of the PRC\'s economic reforms, Quang </p><p>added. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>STEADY FLOW OF SENIOR LEVEL VISITS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  GS Manh\'s visit was the latest in the steady flow </p><p>of bilateral exchanges at the highest levels.  Then-Vice </p><p>President Hu Jintao attended the CPV\'s Ninth Party Congress </p><p>in April 2001; in September 2001, then-Chairman of the </p><p>Standing Committee of the PRC\'s National People\'s Congress </p><p>Li Peng visited; and then-head of state and party Jiang </p><p>Zemin visited in February 2002.  GS Manh visited Beijing </p><p>previously in December 2001.  Prior to that visit, President </p><p>Tran Duc Luong had visited in December 2000 and Prime </p><p>Minister Phan Van Khai in September 2000.  In addition to </p><p>these high-level visits, there are literally dozens of other </p><p>official exchanges annually at the ministerial and expert </p><p>level. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>TIMING </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Although two of Vietnam\'s three major leaders </p><p>were out of the country simultaneously, officials downplayed </p><p>any significance of this timing.  Tran Quang Minh, Assistant </p><p>Director of the Japan Studies Center of Vietnam\'s National </p><p>Center for Social Sciences and Humanities, said that "this </p><p>was not the first time" that Vietnam\'s top leadership had </p><p>been out of the country simultaneously (ref a).  Separately, </p><p>the CPV\'s Quang said that Manh\'s visit had been planned </p><p>"well in advance" and that the timing "depended more on the </p><p>hosts."  Quang also said it was "normal" for GS Manh to </p><p>visit the new leadership "promptly" because his visit </p><p>reaffirmed the "importance that both countries and parties </p><p>hold for each other."  If GS Manh had not gone now, he could </p><p>not have gone for "a couple months," Quang claimed. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>ECONOMICS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  As on previous visits, the leaders lamented that </p><p>the economic relationship, while extensive, "has not reached </p><p>its full potential."  According to press reports, two-way </p><p>trade has grown steadily the past few years.  In 2000, two- </p><p>way trade was USD 2.4 billion.  By 2002, it had reached USD </p><p>3.65 billion.  The oft-stated goal is to reach USD five </p><p>billion by 2005. (Note: These goals are perhaps less </p><p>important than the exact composition in trade; Vietnam\'s </p><p>perennial fear is that virtually all "two-way" trade is and </p><p>will increasingly really be mostly PRC exports to Vietnam. </p><p>end note)  PRC exports include motorbikes, machinery, </p><p>chemical fertilizers, and steel.  Vietnam\'s exports include </p><p>crude oil, rubber, vegetable oil, timber, iron ore, and </p><p>plastics.  The PRC is also the 17th largest foreign investor </p><p>in Vietnam (at least on paper), with 205 projects </p><p>capitalized at about USD 385 million.  The PRC is Vietnam\'s </p><p>largest source of tourists - in 2002, over 723,000 Chinese </p><p>tourists visited Vietnam.  (Note: It remains unclear how the </p><p>SARS outbreak, enhanced GVN screening of visitors, and </p><p>potential new limitations on PRC visitors due to SARS will </p><p>affect 2003 levels.  End note) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Vice Foreign Minister Bang told Ambassador on </p><p>April 18 that the two sides had also discussed large PRC- </p><p>funded projects, including upgrading the Thai Nguyen steel </p><p>complex and the Sinh Quyen copper mine, along with other </p><p>projects related to urea and bauxite.  (Note: The PRC is </p><p>also involved in the Cao Ngan hydroelectric plant in Dak Lak </p><p>province in the Central Highlands.  End note)  He </p><p>highlighted that the PRC had formally agreed to forgive a </p><p>war-era debt of approximately USD 54.3 million as well as to </p><p>provide about USD six million for a Chinese Cultural Center </p><p>in Hanoi. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>LAND AND SEA BORDERS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  As during GS Manh\'s previous trip to the PRC, </p><p>(ref b) both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the land </p><p>border demarcation process as well as to resolving the </p><p>"technical issues" on the Tonkin Gulf and Fisheries </p><p>agreement.  Regarding the land border, Ho Xuan Son, MFA Asia </p><p>I Director General, told the resident diplomatic community </p><p>on April 16 that up to now, "only" about 25 - 30 markers </p><p>have been planted, although work was ongoing.  While </p><p>praising the PRC\'s cooperation, Son said that the GVN would </p><p>like to see a faster pace.  Separately, Tran Viet Hung, </p><p>Director of Vietnam - China Border Department of the MFA </p><p>Border Commission, told poloff on April 18 that, while both </p><p>sides had expressed disappointment at the progress thus far, </p><p>they understood that land demarcation was "complicated" due </p><p>to the inexperience of the border demarcation teams and the </p><p>difficult terrain.  Hung said that both sides had pledged </p><p>"to do their best" to complete the demarcation process </p><p>(begun in September 2002) by the "end of 2005."  (Comment: </p><p>Considering that the demarcation process will require the </p><p>planting of approximately 1,500 more border markers, </p><p>finishing by 2005 will be a major challenge.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Regarding the Tonkin Gulf, VFM Bang told the </p><p>Ambassador that differences had "narrowed" during Manh\'s </p><p>visit on such issues as maritime demarcation and the number, </p><p>tonnage, and horsepower of fishing vessels.  Both sides </p><p>agreed to continue regular meetings to resolve the remaining </p><p>"technical issues."  Separately, the Border Commission\'s </p><p>Hung confirmed that the Vietnamese side remained concerned </p><p>over the size as well as the number of Chinese fishing </p><p>vessels.  Hung noted that the Chinese vessels "tend to be </p><p>much larger than ours." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY OUTLOOK </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  The CPV\'s Quang said that Manh and the PRC </p><p>leadership had exchanged views on various regional and </p><p>international issues.  Although Iraq came up, it was not a </p><p>major focus.  He claimed that the PRC and Vietnam "were </p><p>quite close" on the Iraq issue and that the PRC leadership </p><p>told their guest that they hoped the coalition would put as </p><p>much energy into reconstructing Iraq as it did in the </p><p>military campaign.  Separately, Dr. Do Tien Sam, Director of </p><p>the Institute for China Studies of the National Center for </p><p>Social Sciences and Humanities, told poloff that there was </p><p>less than "total agreement" about Iraq.  Dr. Sam said that </p><p>in the past few years, the PRC had demonstrated a somewhat </p><p>"softer" foreign policy because of its priority in </p><p>developing relations with "more important countries, </p><p>including the U.S."  Dr. Sam also claimed that it was </p><p>"natural" for Vietnam and the PRC to have some differences </p><p>regarding Iraq because of Vietnam\'s stronger view of Iraq as </p><p>a "traditional" friend.  On the other hand, the two sides </p><p>"were not far apart" on Iraq; both shared the view that the </p><p>crisis should have been resolved peacefully within the UN </p><p>framework, with "respect for Iraq\'s territorial </p><p>sovereignty," he added. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  Concerning North Korea, Quang said that the PRC </p><p>and Vietnam have "virtually the same opinion."  Both sides </p><p>said that the crisis should be resolved "via peaceful </p><p>negotiations" and agreed that the Korean Peninsula should be </p><p>"nuclear free."  There was no discussion as to what, if </p><p>anything, Vietnam might contribute to resolving the crisis, </p><p>he added.  Quang predicted that the PRC would have </p><p>"significant influence" in future Korean Peninsula </p><p>discussions. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  VFM Bang separately told the Ambassador that the </p><p>PRC leaders had some "nice things" to say about the United </p><p>States.  VFM Bang noted that GS Manh was relieved to hear </p><p>them, because "it is better to have two elephants dancing </p><p>than two elephants fighting." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  The Manh visit was essentially an exercise to </p><p>reaffirm the strong bilateral relationship between two of </p><p>the few remaining Communist states.  Official denials </p><p>notwithstanding, the fact that GS Manh traveled to Beijing </p><p>so promptly to meet the new leadership highlights that the </p><p>relationship remains far from equal, with the Vietnamese </p><p>caring much more about events in the PRC than the other way </p><p>around.  Balance remains important in Vietnam\'s foreign </p><p>relations, as indicated by the "non-significant" timing vis- </p><p>E-vis PM Khai\'s Japan visit.  Similarly, GS Manh\'s last </p><p>visit to the PRC came on the heels of the passage of the US- </p><p>Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement, as the PRC likely sought </p><p>to ensure the PRC that relations with its neighbor were just </p><p>as important as its ties with the U.S. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
