<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002645 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/16/2011 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, PTER, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENT\'S CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR EAGER </p><p>TO WORK CLOSELY WITH USG ON ALL ECONOMIC ISSUES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 169975 (B) STATE 170551 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter for Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary.  Ambassador Jeter met the President\'s Chief </p><p>Economic Advisor Magnus Kpakol October 11 to discuss a range </p><p>of bilateral economic issues, including the structure of the </p><p>successor to the Joint Economic Partnership Committee (JEPC) </p><p>and possible actions for Nigeria to crack-down on the </p><p>financial assets of terrorists.  Kpakol committed to working </p><p>with the U.S. on the New Africa Initiative, the proposed </p><p>bilateral Economic Committee, and measures to stem terrorist </p><p>money laundering.  The Chief Economic Advisor predicted a </p><p>positive outcome for the incoming IMF Mission.  He also </p><p>stressed the need to increase bilateral trade and investment </p><p>in non-oil sectors.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On October 11, Ambassador Jeter called on the Chief </p><p>Economic Advisor to the President, Magnus Kpakol.  USAID </p><p>Country Director Tom Hobgood, USAID EconOff and Embassy </p><p>EconOff (notetaker) also attended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Anti-terrorism and Money Laundering </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Explaining FATF\'s designation of Nigeria as a </p><p>Non-Cooperative Country/Territory (NCCT), Ambassador Jeter </p><p>emphasized the importance of strengthening domestic controls </p><p>over money laundering and other financial crimes (per </p><p>reftels).  The Ambassador suggested that this issue would be </p><p>a litmus test of Nigeria\'s commitment to combat terrorist </p><p>activities on all fronts.  Nigeria needed to amend existing </p><p>regulations to increase banks\' accountability to the GON, </p><p>widen the scope of anti-money laundering legislation, and </p><p>criminalize money laundering by terrorist groups and/or their </p><p>supporters.  Nigeria would also need to establish a central </p><p>agency to coordinate the fight against financial crimes. </p><p>Kpakol took on board the Ambassador\'s observations, stating </p><p>that this issue has not only critical importance to the U.S., </p><p>but also to Nigeria maintaining control over its economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>New Africa Initiative </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Just returned with President Obasanjo from an </p><p>overnight trip to Brussels, Kpakol was pleased with the </p><p>European Union\'s interest, as expressed by the Belgian Prime </p><p>Minister, in the Africa Initiative and the new African Union </p><p>(AU).  The five participating African Heads of State </p><p>(Obasanjo, Mbeki, Wade, Chiluba and Bouteflika) were well </p><p>received, as was their concept to integrate the Omega Plan </p><p>and Millennium Action Plan into the Africa Initiative to be </p><p>implemented under the aegis of the AU.  Kpakol reported that </p><p>the Belgium PM and EU Secretariat hoped to establish a </p><p>permanent office at the AU and promised to raise the issue at </p><p>the next G-8 meeting.  Kpakol endorsed Ambassador Jeter\'s </p><p>idea that the GON should brief G-8 Ambassadors in Nigeria on </p><p>the proposed Africa Initiative.  The Initiative, Kpakol </p><p>extolled, was truly an African-driven program that would hold </p><p>member-states accountable for democratic governance and </p><p>conflict resolution.  The Initiative also captured African </p><p>nations\' desire to connect national transportation and energy </p><p>infrastructures.  However, Kpakol commented, the Initiative </p><p>lacked sufficient resources; the AU would look to the EU and </p><p>G-8 for help, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Increasing Bilateral Trade and Investment </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Kpakol hoped for progress in the U.S. - Nigeria </p><p>commercial relationship during his tenure as Chief Economic </p><p>Advisor.  Strongly seconding his wish, Ambassador Jeter said </p><p>that, while in Washington, he discussed with the Corporate </p><p>Council on Africa avenues U.S. companies should pursue when </p><p>doing business in Nigeria.  The Ambassador commented that </p><p>skepticism within the U.S. business community remained a </p><p>problem.  Despite the success of U.S. oil and gas companies, </p><p>most non-oil sector companies want concrete non-oil success </p><p>stories before investing in Nigeria. Thus, they all are </p><p>waiting to see who goes first. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Kpakol attributed the lack of success to two reasons. </p><p>First, the strength of the oil and gas industry had caused </p><p>the country to neglect non-oil sectors.  Second, the U.S. </p><p>private sector needed to become more focussed and committed </p><p>in their interactions with Nigerians.  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>concurred, recounting he had discussed this with U.S. </p><p>companies.  The Ambassador had explained to them that the </p><p>Nigerian market was peculiar in that foreign companies cannot </p><p>merely submit bids for public contracts, then wait at home </p><p>for the award letter.  American companies need to be visible </p><p>on the ground, preferably with a Nigerian partner, to spend </p><p>time discussing the project with officials at all levels of </p><p>government.  Developing a relationship with their Nigerian </p><p>business partners, both public and private, will be critical </p><p>to the success of U.S. companies in Nigeria.  Kpakol </p><p>commented that U.S. companies unfortunately perceive Africa </p><p>as distant and somewhat peripheral to U.S. interests whereas </p><p>European businesses have recognized the importance Africa can </p><p>play in the global economy. (They also recognize handsome </p><p>profits can be made when a company stays the course.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Restructuring the Joint Economic Partnership Committee </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>7. (SBU) Ambassador Jeter explained that in discussions </p><p>earlier this year, both sides had expressed dissatisfaction </p><p>that JEPC had not produced concrete results.  Consequently, a </p><p>U.S. interagency committee met to recommend how a "son of </p><p>JEPC" might be structured.  The interagency committee had </p><p>recommended creation of three committees -- Economic, Defense </p><p>and Law Enforcement -- to be led by senior policymakers.  The </p><p>Economic Committee would address agriculture, energy, </p><p>education, transportation, environment and other related </p><p>issues.  The Committee would decide what sub-committee level </p><p>working groups to establish and provide them with concrete </p><p>objectives.  The working groups would formulate action plans </p><p>with each side responsible for completing discreet steps </p><p>towards the agreed objectives.  This system, the Ambassador </p><p>believed, would inject accountability and measurability into </p><p>the bilateral economic relationship.  The Ambassador also </p><p>suggested that the working groups might include private </p><p>sector and state-level participants, contingent on the wishes </p><p>of the GON.  Kpakol welcomed these recommendations, </p><p>suggesting his office would spearhead the Economic Committee </p><p>concept. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>International Monetary Fund </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SB) Finally, the Ambassador asked about the IMF program. </p><p>Optimistic that meetings with the incoming IMF team would be </p><p>more productive than the last IMF visit, Kpakol said, "we </p><p>have a good understanding now."  He noted two areas of </p><p>particular importance -- the exchange rate regime and </p><p>government spending -- that the two sides needed to work </p><p>closely.  Expressing a common sentiment amongst GON </p><p>officials, Kpakol opined that the IMF originally had arrived </p><p>in Nigeria with unrealistic expectations.  The IMF must </p><p>recognize that political exigencies often limit economic </p><p>decision-making.  With elections looming over the horizon, </p><p>the IMF cannot expect the program to progress as earlier </p><p>envisioned.  However, he said, the GON would be more capable </p><p>of implementing tough programs after the 2003 elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Biographic Information.  Kpakol took over the office </p><p>of Chief Economic Advisor in June 2001 after former CEA Chief </p><p>Philip Asiodu was retired.  Kpakol spent the last 25 years in </p><p>Houston, Texas where he was a University professor.  As such, </p><p>Kpakol is familiar with U.S. perceptions of Africa and with </p><p>U.S. idiosyncrasies; Post expects that he will be a helpful </p><p>interlocutor on all bilateral economic issues.  End </p><p>Biographic Information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
