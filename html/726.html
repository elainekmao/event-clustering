HE ANNOUNCED A </p><p>"CEASEFIRE" HAD BEEN AGREED WITH THE SERBS, WHICH HE HOPED </p><p>WOULD END THE ATTACKS ON ZAGREB.  (NOTE: OUR FOLLOW UP </p><p>CONTACTS WITH THE UN INDICATE THAT GRANIC MAY HAVE SPOKEN </p><p>TOO SOON IN ANNOUNCING A CEASEFIRE, IT APPEARS TO BE ONLY </p><p>AN AGREEMENT FOR THE EVACUATION OF SERBS FROM A POCKET IN </p><p>THE NORTH OF THE SECTOR.)  THE GOC HAD DECIDED NOT TO </p><p>RETALIATE FOR THE MISSILE ATTACKS OF MAY 2 AND 3, BUT </p><p>FURTHER ATTACKS WOULD REQUIRE A RESPONSE.  PRESIDENT </p><p>TUDJMAN HAD DECIDED THAT SECTOR WEST WOULD BECOME AN </p><p>EXAMPLE OF HOW TERRITORY COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>REINTEGRATED AND THAT COEXISTENCE OF SERB AND CROAT WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01763  01 OF 03  031853Z </p><p>POSSIBLE, WITH FULL CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ALL CROATIAN SERBS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. FOREIGN MINISTER GRANIC MET WITH THE ENTIRE ZAGREB </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS ON MAY 3 AT 1600.  HE SAID THAT THE GOC </p><p>HAD ACHIEVED ITS OBJECTIVES IN SECTOR WEST, WHICH WERE: 1) </p><p>TO REOPEN THE HIGHWAY UNDER CONDITIONS PERMITTING ITS SAFE </p><p>OPERATION, AND 2) SEVER THE ROUTE BY WHICH THE BOSNIAN </p><p>SERBS COULD OFFER SUPPORT TO THE "RSK."  THE BOSNIAN SERBS </p><p>HAD ATTEMPTED "UNSUCCESSFULLY" TO OFFER SUPPORT TO THE </p><p>KRAJINA SERBS ON TWO OCCASIONS (NFI). </p><p> </p><p>4.  GRANIC STRESSED THAT THE CROATIANS HAD ACTED TO AVOID </p><p>CIVILIAN CASUALTIES; THE TOWN OF OKUCANI WAS ISOLATED, BUT </p><p>IN A WAY WHICH PERMITTED THOSE IN THE POPULATION WHO </p><p>WANTED TO LEAVE A WAY OUT.  THE SERBS WERE CLAIMING THAT </p><p>5000 CIVILIANS HAD FLED THE SECTOR DURING THE ATTACK; THE </p><p>GOC BELIEVED THE NUMBER TO BE CLOSER TO UNHCR\'S ESTIMATE </p><p>OF 2500 PEOPLE.  THE ONLY PIECE OF TERRITORY WHICH THE GOC </p><p>DID NOT YET CONTROL WAS A POCKET OF TERRITORY NORTH OF THE </p><p>HIGHWAY, BETWEEN OKUCANI AND PAKRAC.  THE SERBS SAID IT </p><p>CONTAINED 600 SOLDIERS AND 3000 CIVILIANS, BUT THE GOC </p><p>COULD NOT CONFIRM THOSE NUMBERS.  AN AGREEMENT HAD BEEN </p><p>REACHED BY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER KOSTOVIC ON MAY 2 THAT </p><p>THOSE AMONG THAT GROUP WHO WISHED TO LEAVE FOR BOSNIAN </p><p>SERB HELD TERRITORY COULD DO SO UNDER UN AUSPICES.  THE </p><p>GOC HAD PROMISED TO ALL WHO CHOOSE TO STAY THAT THEY WOULD </p><p>HAVE FULL CIVIL RIGHTS AND THEIR WOULD BE A COMPLETE </p><p>AMNESTY FOR ALL WHO TURNED IN THEIR ARMS, EXCEPT FOR THOSE </p><p>GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01763  01 OF 03  031853Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AGREEMENT REACHED AT 1630 MAY 3 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>5. SHORTLY INTO THE MEETING, GRANIC WAS CALLED AWAY FOR A </p><p>PHONE CALL WITH GOC PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF HRVOJE </p><p>SARINIC.  GRANIC RETURNED TO REPORT THAT SARINIC HAD </p><p>REACHED A "CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES" WITH THE KRAJINA </p><p>SERBS, WITH THE MEDIATION OF UN SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>AKASHI.  HE THEN PASSED AROUND A COPY OF THE FOUR- </p><p>PARAGRAPH AGREEMENT (COPY FAXED TO EUR/SCE).  THE </p><p>AGREEMENT STATED THAT "THERE WILL BE A TOTAL CESSATION OF </p><p>HOSTILITIES IN SECTOR WEST (WESTERN SLAVONIA) AND </p><p>ELSEWHERE FROM 1700 HOURS 3 MAY 1995" AND SAID ALL WHO </p><p>WISH TO LEAVE SECTOR WEST COULD DO SO UNDER UN </p><p>"SURVEILLANCE."  GRANIC SAID THAT SARINIC HAD AGREED </p><p>TO </p><p>THE TERMS FROM THE CROATIAN SIDE.  HE WAS UNSURE WHO HAD </p><p>AGREED FROM THE KRAJINA SERB SIDE.  GRANIC NOTED THAT THE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ7050 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7050 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01763  02 OF 03  031854Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  OASY-00  TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-10    L-01     ADS-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   PM-00    P-01 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    SNIS-00  NISC-01  PMB-00     /017W </p><p>                  ------------------C1D7F4  031854Z /38 </p><p>O 031949Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5643 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAKU </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5/ECPOLAD// </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J-5PMA/J21// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 001763 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR A/S HOLBROOKE </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01763  02 OF 03  031854Z </p><p>BAKU FOR DCM FINN </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 5/2/2010 </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS HR UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  UPDATE 15 ON SECTOR WEST: GRANIC ANNOUNCES </p><p>          CEASEFIRE; SAYS GOC WON\'T RETALIATE FOR MAY 3 </p><p>          MISSILE ATTACKS EITHER </p><p> </p><p>GOC HAD BEEN IN CONTACT WITH BELGRADE ON MAY 3 "AT THE </p><p>HIGHEST LEVELS" BOTH DIRECTLY AND VIA THE UN.  THE GOC </p><p>BELIEVED THAT BELGRADE HAD WEIGHED IN WITH KNIN IN FAVOR </p><p>OF THE CEASEFIRE. </p><p> </p><p>6. GRANIC EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THE CESSATION OF </p><p>HOSTILITIES AGREEMENT WOULD MEAN THE END TO THE ROCKET </p><p>ATTACKS ON ZAGREB, ALTHOUGH HE NOTED THAT THERE WERE "NO </p><p>GUARANTEES." </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENT:  WHEN WE CHECKED WITH THE UN CIVIL AFFAIRS </p><p>COORDINATOR IN KNIN, WE WERE TOLD THE CESSATION OF </p><p>HOSTILITIES AGREEMENT HAD BEEN NEGOTIATED ON THE SERB SIDE </p><p>BY "PRIME MINISTER" MIKELIC; MARTIC\'S CHIEF OF STAFF, </p><p>ILIJA PRIJIC; AND MILITARY "CHIEF OF STAFF" LONCAR.  THE </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF THE SERBS FROM THE PAKRAC POCKET WAS </p><p>SCHEDULED TO OCCUR AT 0900 HOURS LOCAL ON MAY 4. MIKELIC, </p><p>PRIJIC AND LONCAR HAD ALSO SIGNED A TEXT OF A CEASEFIRE </p><p>AGREEMENT WHICH HAD FOUR ESSENTIAL POINTS:  1) BOTH SIDES </p><p>WOULD "WITHDRAW" TO THE LINES AS BEFORE MAY 1; 20 THE UN </p><p>ALONE WOULD CONTROL THE HIGHWAY UNDER A SPECIAL REGIME; 3) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01763  02 OF 03  031854Z </p><p>BOTH SIDES WOULD RESPECT THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND </p><p>SAFETY OF UN PERSONNEL; 4) FURTHER CONSULTATIONS WOULD BE </p><p>HELD.  GRANIC MADE NO MENTION OF ANY CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH THESE TERMS, AND WE CANNOT IMAGINE THE GOC AGREEING </p><p>TO A "WITHDRAWAL" WHICH WOULD SIMPLY RESTORE THE STATUS </p><p>QUO ANTE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>NO CROATIAN RETALIATION FOR MISSILE ATTACKS ON ZAGREB </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>8. GRANIC SAID THAT THE GOC HAD MADE THE DECISION, DESPITE </p><p>"LOTS OF PUBLIC PRESSURE," NOT TO RESPOND TO THE MISSILE </p><p>ATTACKS OF MAY 2 OR MAY 3.  GRANIC GAVE DETAILS, AS </p><p>CURRENTLY KNOWN, ON THE ATTACKS.  ON MAY 2, SIX ROCKETS </p><p>WERE FIRED AT ZAGREB, RESULTING IN SIX DEATHS AND 143 </p><p>INJURED (ONE OF THE INJURED WAS LIKELY TO DIE).  ON MAY 3, </p><p>THERE WERE NINE ROCKETS (SIX IN THE CITY CENTER AND THREE </p><p>IN THE WIDER AREA).  ONE POLICEMAN HAD DIED WHILE </p><p>DISARMING AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AND TWO CIVILIANS WHO WERE </p><p>INJURED IN THE ATTACKS WERE EXPECTED TO DIE FROM THEIR </p><p>WOUNDS.  41 OTHER WERE CONFIRMED AS INJURED, AMONG THE </p><p>SERIOUSLY INJURED WAS THE TWENTY-ONE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER OF </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER KOSTOVIC (GRANIC NOTED HIS OWN </p><p>DAUGHTER HAD BEEN AT THE HIGH SCHOOL HIT IN YESTERDAY\'S </p><p>ATTACK).  GRANIC STRESSED THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN EASY FOR </p><p>THE GOC TO SHOW RESTRAINT IN RESPONDING TO THE MISSILE </p><p>ATTACKS.  IN THIS REGARD, GRANIC NOTED THAT CROATIA\'S </p><p>CONTINUED NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EU HAD BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR </p><p>IN REENFORCING CROATIA\'S RESTRAINT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01763  02 OF 03  031854Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>FURTHER MISSILE ATTACKS WOULD REQUIRE RESPONSE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>9. IF THERE WERE FURTHER MISSILE ATTACKS, HOWEVER, GRANIC </p><p>SAID THE GOC WOULD HAVE TO TAKE ACTION "TO PROTECT </p><p>OURSELVES FROM THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF ATTACK."  BUT HE </p><p>STRESSED THAT THE GOC WOULD IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES TARGET </p><p>CIVILIANS IN ANY ATTACK.  GRANIC ALSO SAID THAT THE GOC </p><p>WOULD BE SUPPLYING THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL WITH INFORMATION </p><p>SHOWING THAT THE CLUSTER BOMB ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN TARGETS </p><p>HAD BEEN ORDERED BY "RSK PRESIDENT" MARTIC AND AGREED TO </p><p>BY "RSK" COMMANDER CELEKETIC.  "RSK CHIEF OF STAFF" LONCAR </p><p>WAS ALSO IMPLICATED.  HE INDICATED THAT CROATIAN COURTS </p><p>WOULD ALSO PURSUE CHARGES AGAINST THOSE RESPONSIBLE. </p><p>- </p><p>10. GRANIC ALSO INDICATED THAT THE GOC HAD MANY REPORTS OF </p><p>INTERNAL CONFLICTS AMONG THE KRAJINA SERBS, BOTH IN KNIN </p><p>AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.  THERE WERE REPORTS OF CIVILIANS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ7051 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7051 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01763  03 OF 03  031854Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  OASY-00  TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-10    L-01     ADS-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   PM-00    P-01 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    SNIS-00  NISC-01  PMB-00     /017W </p><p>                  ------------------C1D7FA  031854Z /38 </p><p>O 031949Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5644 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAKU </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5/ECPOLAD// </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J-5PMA/J21// </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 001763 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR A/S HOLBROOKE </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01763  03 OF 03  031854Z </p><p>BAKU FOR DCM FINN </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 5/2/2010 </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS HR UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  UPDATE 15 ON SECTOR WEST: GRANIC ANNOUNCES </p><p>          CEASEFIRE; SAYS GOC WON\'T RETALIATE FOR MAY 3 </p><p>          MISSILE ATTACKS EITHER </p><p> </p><p>TRYING TO FLEE THE UNPAS BEING BLOCKED BY SERB POLICE. </p><p>THESE SPLITS HAD BEEN AGGRAVATED BY EVENTS SINCE MAY 1. </p><p>MARTIC HAD BEEN TRYING TO AGGRAVATE THE SITUATION TO </p><p>SECURE HIS POSITION AND TO BRING THE VIOLENCE TO A LEVEL </p><p>WHERE BELGRADE WOULD BE FORCED TO RESPOND IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>THE "RSK." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>SECTOR WEST TO BE AN EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL REINT </p><p>EGRATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>11.
