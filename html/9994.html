(U) The International Food Policy Research Institute </p><p>(IFPRI) led a July 24 policy dialogue session in Dhaka to </p><p>review key findings and preliminary recommendations of its </p><p>WFP commissioned Food Aid Leakages study. Sub-studies on </p><p>losses linked to discharge in ports, transit losses through </p><p>the national Public Food Distribution System (PFDS) to the </p><p>district level, and from Local Supply Depots (LSD) to the </p><p>beneficiary - were presented. While loss rates were </p><p>acknowledged to be unacceptably high, GOB affirmed its </p><p>decision to vigorously pursue the study\'s recommendations </p><p>through adoption of a plan of action. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In May 2001, the WFP Rome Secretariat informed the </p><p>Executive Board of the commencement of a sustained effort in </p><p>Bangladesh with bilateral and multilateral food aid donors </p><p>(U.S., Canada, others) to address the problem of suspected </p><p>food leakage to non-targeted beneficiaries or elsewhere </p><p>through GOB-controlled distribution channels. WFP\'s initial </p><p>misgivings came from a 1997 request it made to IFPRI to </p><p>carry out a preliminary study to investigate the magnitude </p><p>of the problem of food aid leakages in WFP-sponsored </p><p>activities and develop a monitoring methodology capable of </p><p>controlling in-country losses. In 1998, a comprehensive food </p><p>commodity tracking system appraisal was carried out. In </p><p>1999, the WFP country office established a food transport </p><p>and storage-monitoring unit. Since then, efforts have been </p><p>made to inform vulnerable group and emergency operation </p><p>beneficiaries, as well as the public at large, of their </p><p>rights and entitlements related to rations. </p><p>In recent years WFP has also proceeded to open a number of </p><p>sub-offices throughout Bangladesh. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The latest (and most ambitious) IFPRI study began in </p><p>October 2002 and fieldwork was concluded by March 2003. A </p><p>first draft of the findings was issued. With the caveat that </p><p>donors and the WFP leadership were convinced that this </p><p>process could not be rushed in order to assure complete GOB </p><p>ownership of the results, a final report dialogue session </p><p>was held in Dhaka on July 24, chaired by Dr. Quazi </p><p>Mesbahuddin Ahmed, Additional Secretary, Economic Relations </p><p>Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and amply attended by </p><p>numerous responsible counterpart Ministries. US Mission/Rome </p><p>Humanitarian Attache Tim Lavelle and Program Analyst Phil </p><p>Lamade attended this session. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Major findings </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Port losses for WFP imports are adjudged by IFPRI </p><p>to be 1.55 percent of listed Bill of Lading Quantities. </p><p>Transit losses in the Public Distribution System (which </p><p>moves the commodities from the port to the district level </p><p>through the Ministry of Food) were calculated at 0.72 </p><p>percent. Most worrying are losses from the local supply </p><p>depots (LSD) of the Ministry of Food through the finalS PENN, MCHAMBLISS, </p><p>RTILSWORTH AND LPANASUK </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, AA/DCHA WINTER, AA/ANE, </p><p>D/DCHA/OFDA BMCCONNELL, D/DCHA/FFP LANDIS </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USAID/PLERNER </p><p>USUN FOR MLUTZ </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA/LYNCH AND USAID/KYLOH </p><p>NSC FOR JD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>delivery to beneficiaries, which are calculated at 8 percent </p><p>for WFP\'s major effort in Bangladesh, the Vulnerable Group </p><p>Development (VGD) scheme. Part of these local losses are </p><p>attributed to the pressure to feed additional "ultra poor" </p><p>or destitute who are not officially listed beneficiaries </p><p>(i.e., dilution of rations); use of some of the food to pay </p><p>expenses related to handling and local transport; and </p><p>deliberate underweighing of rations at distribution sites by </p><p>local authorities. Note: WFP\'s VGD activity covers 500,000 </p><p>vulnerable women on an annual basis. Bangladesh\'s "ultra </p><p>poor" are calculated at 30 million and the number of </p><p>chronically undernourished around 45-50 million, so that </p><p>there is constant "pressure" to feed more vulnerable people </p><p>than are listed on official coverage rolls. End note. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In practice, GOB has been absorbing the port and in- </p><p>transit losses and crediting WFP with the Bill of Lading </p><p>quantities at the LSD level. Even so, port and in- </p><p>transit/storage losses up to the local level still </p><p>constitute a loss to the national wealth and failure to </p><p>seriously consider recurring shortfalls hardly provides any </p><p>concerted incentive to ratchet down these losses to </p><p>acceptable levels. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) At the end of the working session on July 24, it was </p><p>agreed by IFPRI and the concerned parties that the finalized </p><p>report and recommendations, in addition to a specific plan </p><p>of action with timetables - would be made available by mid- </p><p>September. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) On specific losses by category, the following: </p><p> </p><p>-Ports: operational losses due to normal handling and </p><p>spillage is estimated to be 0.05 percent and the loss due to </p><p>pilferage and other forms of misuse is estimated at 1.50 </p><p>percent. Losses due to pilferage appear to be associated </p><p>with the involvement of numerous agents and agencies in food </p><p>aid imports which makes assigning of direct responsibility </p><p>difficult (i.e., "too many cooks"); the absence of </p><p>appropriate legal mechanisms to provide financial incentives </p><p>to stevedores and other parties engaged in discharge; the </p><p>presence of "tainted" unions in the principal ports; and </p><p>collusion; </p><p> </p><p>-Public Food Distribution System (PFDS): As per IFPRI, in- </p><p>transit and storage losses in the PFDS have substantially </p><p>declined in the 1990s. Transit loss of food grains, which </p><p>was as high as 3.5 percent of total distribution during the </p><p>1980s - declined to 0.30 percent between 1998 and 2002, </p><p>while storage losses were reduced from 1.5 percent to 0.72 </p><p>percent. Despite progress, IFPRI sees room for further </p><p>improvements. In particular, an analysis of stock rotation </p><p>suggests that 35 percent of the food grain distributed to </p><p>beneficiaries is more than nine months old; </p><p> </p><p>-LSD to final beneficiary: District level Union Parishad </p><p>(UP) chairpersons and members who distribute food grain to </p><p>beneficiaries report lengthy delays or non-receipt of </p><p>transport or handling commissions. Further, the approved </p><p>rates are generally not sufficient to cover all the costs </p><p>involved. Moreover, an absence of standardized and reliable </p><p>weighing techniques makes monitoring of correct rations </p><p>amounts difficult. IFPRI (through independent weighing of a </p><p>random sample size of beneficiaries) determined that under </p><p>delivery to the beneficiary averaged 7.53 percent and </p><p>discrepancies in beneficiary lists accounted for a further </p><p>0.48 percent loss, bringing the total leakage level in the </p><p>VGD program at the local level to 8.01 percent.S FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS, </p><p>RTILSWORTH AND LPANASUK </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, AA/DCHA WINTER, AA/ANE, </p><p>D/DCHA/OFDA BMCCONNELL, D/DCHA/FFP LANDIS </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USAID/PLERNER </p><p>USUN FOR MLUTZ </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA/LYNCH AND USAID/KYLOH </p><p>NS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Major Recommendations </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The quantity recorded in a Bill of Lading should be </p><p>considered the reference quantity for agreements between the </p><p>GOB and donors on the amount of food grains delivered; </p><p> </p><p>-The number of independent surveyors/agents involved in food </p><p>aid imports should be reduced and the process further </p><p>streamlined. Preferably, all tallies should be performed by </p><p>independent surveyors; </p><p> </p><p>-Preference should be given to the port of Chittagong which </p><p>is more effectively managed than is Mongla port; </p><p> </p><p>-A comprehensive data base should be developed by WFP, </p><p>Ministry of Food, shipping and lightering agents. This would </p><p>produce a common information set, available to all parties </p><p>without time lags; </p><p> </p><p>-GOB should expedite payment of incentives to stevedores and </p><p>others engaged in the discharge process; </p><p> </p><p>-In the PFDS system, transporters should assume full </p><p>responsibility for delivery of full invoiced quantities; </p><p> </p><p>-International food aid arrivals should be scheduled so that </p><p>they do not coincide with the GOB\'s procurement season; </p><p> </p><p>-The GOB and the donors should formulate a single cost </p><p>sharing arrangement to cover internal transport, shipping </p><p>and handling (ITSH) costs; </p><p> </p><p>-Transportation and handling costs from the LSD to </p><p>distribution center should be assessed for each Union and </p><p>necessary allowances allocated in advance; </p><p> </p><p>-Weighing of rations at distribution sites should be </p><p>performed using standard volume weighing measure; </p><p> </p><p>-As involuntary sharing of food rations violates program </p><p>rules, steps should be taken to enforce a ban on this </p><p>process; </p><p> </p><p>-The GOB and WFP should monitor program activity regularly </p><p>to observe whether unauthorized activities exist, and take </p><p>corrective measures, including strict disciplinary actions, </p><p>whenever such activities are detected. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Note. IFPRI also propounded: a) downsizing of the </p><p>GOB\'s national security stock reserve from 800,000 metric </p><p>tons (mts) to 600,000 mts, now that the private market plays </p><p>a more important role in price stabilization; and b) PFDS </p><p>auctioning off donations of red wheat (which commands a </p><p>higher price on the local market), and delivering only white </p><p>wheat varieties to WFP beneficiaries, which IFPRI maintains </p><p>that the poor prefer. These are complex recommendations </p><p>which will probably require further analysis. End note. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) WFP has a USD 67 million/annum program in </p><p>Bangladesh. To combat leakages, they have moved away in part </p><p>from whole grain distribution through promotion of atta FOR A/S PRM DEWEY, </p><p>IO A/S HOLMES, EUR/NE, EUR/WE, </p><p>SA/INS, IO/EDA SKOTOK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS, RTILSWORTH AND LPANASUK </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, AA/DCHA WINTER, AA/ANE, </p><p>D/DCHA/OFDA BMCCONNELL, D/DCHA/FFP LANDIS </p><p>BRU </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(flour) fortification mills (which produce a readily </p><p>identifiable product) in a number of rural areas, with </p><p>support from USAID and CIDA; WFP has also launched a </p><p>national primary school feeding project using enriched </p><p>biscuits which contain the WFP-logo. Yet more needs to be </p><p>done to ensure that beneficiaries do indeed obtain their </p><p>agreed upon rations. While WFP is to be given due credit for </p><p>identifying the problem, given the sizable amounts of </p><p>commodity leakage involved, WFP, the GOB and the principal </p><p>donors now need to fix what has been well documented (by the </p><p>highly-respected IFPRI) to be broken. Every case of </p><p>commodity hemorrhaging in today\'s constrained budgetary </p><p>environment has to be swiftly and vigorously addressed. </p><p>Bangladesh cannot be the exception to this rule.
