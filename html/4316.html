On the surface, the </p><p>situation in Batticaloa and Ampara Districts seemed </p><p>calm, with the ceasefire sparking increased business </p><p>activity and civilian bustle.

Muslims were </p><p>increasingly worked up about the apparent surge in LTTE </p><p>influence.  Given the disturbing trends acting under the </p><p>surface calm, continued communal friction and violence </p><p>appear a near certainty.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>Calm on the Surface in the East </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) DCM and polchief visited Sri Lanka\'s Eastern </p><p>Province on November 12.  The visit focused on the </p><p>province\'s Batticaloa and Ampara Districts, with the </p><p>team stopping in the towns of Batticaloa, Karativu, and </p><p>Akkaraipattu.  During the course of the visit, the team </p><p>also closely observed the prevailing situation along a </p><p>80-mile stretch of the main coastal road from Vandeloos </p><p>Bay in the north to Arugam Bay in the south. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) On the surface at least, the situation seemed </p><p>quite calm.  Compared to visits by Mission teams earlier </p><p>this year (see Ref B), there were very few government </p><p>security forces patrolling the roads.  Most of the </p><p>military checkpoints had also been dismantled, a factor </p><p>greatly easing freedom of movement for civilians. </p><p>Markets were bustling in all of the towns.  A relatively </p><p>poorer area than Colombo, there remained very few cars </p><p>on the roads in the east, but there was significant </p><p>traffic in buses, tractors (often used to carry </p><p>passengers), and scooters.  Due to an easing in </p><p>government regulations per the February ceasefire </p><p>accord, the fishing industry -- which is important in </p><p>the east -- was back on its feet to a large extent, a </p><p>factor contributing to an improved economic outlook. </p><p> </p><p>============================================= ==== </p><p>Tigers Strengthen Political and Military Position </p><p>============================================= ==== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Amid this positive news, there were clear and </p><p>troubling indications that the Tamil Tigers are </p><p>gradually expanding their network of political and </p><p>military control.  In terms of the optics alone, the </p><p>Tiger presence was a bit jarring.  The team, for </p><p>example, passed well over a dozen "political" offices </p><p>newly opened by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) in Tamil-dominated towns.  The offices were </p><p>clearly marked with large, professionally made signs </p><p>portraying a roaring Tiger flanked by two assault guns. </p><p>Red and yellow streamers (the LTTE colors) hung outside </p><p>the offices, boldly announcing their presence. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Beyond the amazing optics, interlocutors also </p><p>told a tale of expanding Tiger control.  Reciting for </p><p>the team a long litany of concerns about LTTE </p><p>activities, Colonel Silva, the Batticaloa-based </p><p>commander of the Sri Lankan Army\'s 233 Brigade, </p><p>confirmed recent newspaper reports that the LTTE was </p><p>opening up "courts" and "police posts" in areas the </p><p>group controls in the east.  (Note:  This a new trend. </p><p>The LTTE has been opening up such offices in the areas </p><p>it controls in the north for some time, but only lately </p><p>has it begun to do so in the east.)  Silva confirmed </p><p>reports that the LTTE had basically intimidated Tamils </p><p>in the east to use its "police" and "court" system, even </p><p>kidnapping Tamils living in government-controlled areas </p><p>to ensure their appearance in "court."  K.L.M. </p><p>Sarathchandra, the commander of the highly trained </p><p>Special Task Force (STF) police in the Batticaloa/Ampara </p><p>sector, told the team that Tamils -- a plurality of the </p><p>population in the east -- were basically avoiding the </p><p>GSL police and legal system.  Sarathchandra and Silva </p><p>indicated that the security forces -- while concerned -- </p><p>really could not do much to stop the LTTE from these </p><p>activities without undermining the ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In addition to its efforts to enhance its civil </p><p>apparatus, the LTTE also seems to be steadily augmenting </p><p>its military position.  Colonel Silva estimated that </p><p>LTTE cadre numbers in the east had increased to 8,000 at </p><p>present from about 2,000 before the ceasefire went into </p><p>effect.  Many of these cadre were dealing with political </p><p>matters, but all of them had received at least some </p><p>military training.  In the meantime, the LTTE was also </p><p>working to strengthen its base fortifications, </p><p>stockpiling arms and ammunition, and expanding its </p><p>network of military bases.  Sarathchandra noted that the </p><p>LTTE had recently constructed a new base in northern </p><p>Ampara, which was its closest yet to the coast.  Despite </p><p>the apparent surge in LTTE military strength, Silva </p><p>indicated that he was confident that his forces could </p><p>defend their positions adequately if the Tigers were to </p><p>launch a surprise attack.  Silva and Sarathchandra, </p><p>however, both allowed that government security forces </p><p>were stuck in static positions and increasingly </p><p>marginalized as a force in the east.  DCM noted that any </p><p>notion that the Sri Lankan security forces would </p><p>completely withdraw from the north and east, as some </p><p>pro-LTTE Tamils were advocating, was a non-starter. </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>Human Rights Concerns re LTTE </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Human rights observers expressed deep concern </p><p>about LTTE activities.  Father Harry Miller, an Amcit </p><p>Jesuit priest who has lived in the east since 1948, told </p><p>the team that the LTTE was steadily increasing its </p><p>pressure on the local Tamil population.  The LTTE was </p><p>"taxing" Tamils and also forcibly recruiting youths.  If </p><p>citizens objected to LTTE demands, they were threatened </p><p>and harassed into backing down.  Miller related that the </p><p>school he teaches at had been a target:  the LTTE had </p><p>recently dragooned a number of schoolchildren to do work </p><p>at one of its camps.  The children had been released, </p><p>but one had died in a fall off a tractor. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Confirming the thread of Miller\'s comments, Helen </p><p>Peters, the acting head of the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM) office in Batticaloa, also </p><p>told the team that her office had received dozens of </p><p>reports that the LTTE had seized houses owned by Tamils </p><p>in the district.  The LTTE\'s apparent belief was that no </p><p>one should have more than one house -- if they did, it </p><p>was important that they contribute it to the cause, </p><p>i.e., the LTTE and its push for Tamil rights.  Peters </p><p>and Miller stressed that security forces were </p><p>essentially doing nothing to counter the LTTE\'s </p><p>activities.  The SLMM was trying to keep track of the </p><p>situation and was raising concerns on human rights </p><p>issues during meetings with LTTE officials, however. </p><p>(Note:  Miller\'s comments expressing concern that </p><p>government security forces were taking too soft an </p><p>approach were a bit of a change in tune for him.  For </p><p>many years, he had consistently complained about GSL </p><p>human rights violations against Tamils and not about </p><p>LTTE activities.) </p><p> </p><p>================= </p><p>Deep Muslim Anger </p><p>================= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Muslims are increasingly worked up about the </p><p>apparent surge in LTTE influence.  In a meeting with a </p><p>group of Muslims at Southeastern University, the team </p><p>was told that Muslims felt that the LTTE was slowly but </p><p>surely working to take over the Eastern Province. </p><p>M.L.A. Cader, the vice-chancellor of the university, was </p><p>adamant that eastern Muslims had to take steps to ensure </p><p>that the government in Colombo heard their concerns. </p><p>Muslims felt they were being "abandoned" and "sold out" </p><p>by a government eager to make peace at any price with </p><p>the LTTE.  Cader bitterly criticized Rauf Hakeem, the </p><p>head of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), asserting </p><p>that Hakeem did not care about eastern Muslims and was </p><p>only interested in maintaining his ministerial position </p><p>in the government.  On the human rights side, Cader </p><p>admitted that "LTTE pressure" on Muslims was a bit less </p><p>of late.  Cader thought that this was clearly a tactic </p><p>on the LTTE\'s part meant to quiet critics, while the </p><p>group continued its efforts to isolate Muslims and </p><p>marginalize the security forces.  In response to Cader\'s </p><p>concerns, the U.S. team underscored strong support for </p><p>the peace process, stressing that the U.S. urged all </p><p>sides to work together and exercise restraint. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) (((Note:  The U.S. team repeatedly asked </p><p>interlocutors about continuing reports of Muslim </p><p>extremism in the east.  Most observers had little clear- </p><p>cut information about the matter and Muslim </p><p>interlocutors denied it was a factor.  Nonetheless, the </p><p>team did notice many new mosques under construction and </p><p>various "Islamic foundation" offices operating in Muslim </p><p>towns.  It is hard to see how eastern Muslims could </p><p>afford to pay for the construction of all the new </p><p>mosques, so it would seem possible that Middle Eastern </p><p>money is coming in, as some claim.  When queried, Sri </p><p>Lankan security forces replied that they had not seen </p><p>any Arabs or Pakistanis visiting the region.  GSL </p><p>officials added that they just were not sure what was </p><p>going on in Muslim areas, however.  They had heard of </p><p>small extremist groups with names like "Jihad" and </p><p>"Osama" operating in the east, but did not think they </p><p>were much of a threat to the peace.  Pro-LTTE Tamils </p><p>that the team met with repeatedly claimed that Muslims </p><p>were radicalized, and armed and dangerous.  One pro-LTTE </p><p>figure, V. Kamaladas, the head of a local NGO Forum for </p><p>the east, basically indicated that the U.S. and the LTTE </p><p>should join together to defeat the Muslims!  End </p><p>Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) It is good news that the ceasefire seems to be </p><p>working to allow increased economic activity in the </p><p>east, a factor which may act to reinforce the peace </p><p>process.  Moreover, the LTTE seems to have loosened its </p><p>grip on the Muslim community to a large extent.  These </p><p>factors are net positives, but given the disturbing </p><p>trends acting under the surface calm, most especially </p><p>the LTTE\'s surge in influence, renewed Muslim-LTTE </p><p>friction appears a near certainty.  Communal battle </p><p>lines are hardening (as witnessed by the sprouting of </p><p>LTTE offices and new mosques) and it is probable that </p><p>flashpoints will erupt again soon.  The GSL, meanwhile, </p><p>seems inclined to hope for the best, but its major focus </p><p>appears to be ensuring that the peace process with the </p><p>LTTE is not disrupted.  That said, despite its apparent </p><p>marginalization, the government still seems intent on </p><p>remaining a force in the east.  There is no indication </p><p>that it plans to withdraw its troops on the ground, for </p><p>example, a policy which if put in motion could prove </p><p>profoundly destabilizing.   END COMMENT. </p><p>12.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
