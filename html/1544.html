(C) MODERATES ALIGNED TO MASVINGO ZANU-PF "SUPREMO" </p><p>EDDISON ZVOBGO BOYCOTTED FEBRUARY 24\'S PROVINCIAL PARTY </p><p>ELECTIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE A "SHAM."  THE ZANU-PF </p><p>FACTION ALIGNED WITH MASVINGO GOVERNOR JOSIAH HUNGWE, </p><p>WHO IS AN ALLY OF PRESIDENT MUGABE AND VICE-PRESIDENT </p><p>MUZENDA, WERE ELECTED TO THE PARTY\'S PROVINCIAL </p><p>EXECUTIVE UNOPPOSED.  MINISTER OF EDUCATION, SPORTS AND </p><p>CULTURE SAMUEL MUMBENGEGWI WAS ELECTED CHAIRMAN OF THE </p><p>MASVINGO PARTY STRUCTURE, AND WAR VETERANS WERE ELECTED </p><p>TO MOST OTHER KEY POSTS, ACCORDING TO THE FEBRUARY 26 </p><p>EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD."  THE </p><p>NEW PROVINCIAL EXECUTIVE REPLACES THE ONE SUSPENDED LAST </p><p>YEAR BY THE POLITBURO.  MUMBENGEGWI REPLACES LONG-TIME </p><p>PROVINCIAL CHAIRMAN DZIKAMAI MAVHAIRE, AN ALLY OF </p><p>ZVOBGO. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ZVOBGO TOLD CHARGE AND POLOFF FEBRUARY 26 THAT </p><p>THE PARTY ELECTIONS WERE "BOGUS" AND FLOUTED ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>OWN ELECTORAL PROCEDURES, WHICH WAS WHY HIS FACTION DID </p><p>NOT PARTICIPATE.  ZVOBGO HAD MADE CLEAR TO NATIONAL </p><p>CHAIRMAN JOHN NKOMO AND VICE-PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00847  261603Z </p><p>THE "MINIMUM CONDITIONS DID NOT EXIST" FOR HIS </p><p>PARTICIPATION, AND THAT HE WOULD NOT BE A CANDIDATE FOR </p><p>PROVINCIAL CHAIRMAN.  HE TOLD THEM THAT THE ELECTION </p><p>WOULD BE A "FRAUD" AND ASKED FOR THE ELECTION TO BE </p><p>POSTPONED, BUT PARTY COMMISSAR BORDER GEZI ALLOWED THE </p><p>ELECTIONS TO GO FORWARD ANYWAY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ZVOBGO TOLD US THAT THE PARTY DID NOT FOLLOW ITS </p><p>OWN PROCEDURES FOR THE ELECTIONS.  NORMALLY, EVERY FOUR </p><p>YEARS, THE PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIP PREPARES A REPORT ON </p><p>THE STATE OF THE PROVINCE AND CONVENES A MEETING OF ALL </p><p>LOCAL PARTY LEADERS AND STAKEHOLDERS.  AT THIS MEETING, </p><p>THE MODALITIES OF NEW ELECTIONS, SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF </p><p>ELECTORAL DISTRICTS AND DELEGATES, ARE DETERMINED, </p><p>ZVOBGO STATED.  THIS TIME, SUCH A MEETING WAS NOT HELD, </p><p>AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE DISTRICTS WAS NOT MADE </p><p>AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE.  RECORDS WERE REMOVED FROM THE </p><p>PARTY OFFICES, AND THE PARTY REGISTER WAS TAMPERED WITH, </p><p>ZVOBGO ASSERTED.  IN ADDITION, DISTRICT CHAIRMEN-- </p><p>LOCALLY-ELECTED PARTY REPRESENTATIVES--ARE USUALLY </p><p>APPOINTED AS THE DELEGATES WHO ELECT THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  THIS TIME, UNELECTED PEOPLE FAVORABLE TO </p><p>HUNGWE AND MUZENDA WERE APPOINTED, AND THE LOCAL </p><p>CHAIRMEN WERE SIDELINED.  ZVOBGO CONCLUDED THAT HIS </p><p>FACTION HAD NO CHANCE OF WINNING THE ELECTIONS, AND SO </p><p>THEY BOYCOTTED THEM.  ZVOBGO DESCRIBED THE NEW </p><p>PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIP AS "BOGUS" AND "ILLEGITIMATE." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ZVOBGO HAD HOPED THE ELECTIONS WOULD UNITE THE </p><p>LONG-DIVIDED PROVINCE, BUT INSTEAD, IT WILL BE MORE </p><p>DIVIDED THAN EVER, HE OPINED.  THE MASVINGO "SUPREMO" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00847  261603Z </p><p>TOLD US THAT HE SOON PLANS TO HOLD A PROVINCE-WIDE PARTY </p><p>CONFERENCE WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF SEVEN DISTRICT </p><p>COUNCILS IN WHAT SOUNDS LIKE AN ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH A </p><p>PARALLEL ZANU-PF STRUCTURE IN MASVINGO.  ZVOBGO OFFERED </p><p>NO OTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE TIMING AND PURPOSE OF THIS </p><p>CONFERENCE, BUT SOUGHT FUNDING FROM US TO PULL IT OFF. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: THE MASVINGO ZANU-PF "ELECTIONS" </p><p>PROVIDE YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF MUGABE\'S CADRE RUNNING </p><p>ROUGHSHOD OVER RULES AND REGULATIONS, EVEN IN ITS OWN </p><p>PARTY.  EVEN THE NOMINAL DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURES OF ZANU- </p><p>PF ARE GIVEN SHORT SHRIFT IN THIS CURRENT LAWLESS </p><p>ENVIRONMENT.  UNLESS ZVOBGO CAN QUICKLY MARSHALL </p><p>PROVINCE-WIDE SUPPORT AT HIS UPCOMING CONFERENCE, HIS </p><p>DAYS AS A FORCE IN MASVINGO AND ZANU-PF POLITICS COULD </p><p>BE NUMBERED.  HE REPRESENTS ONE OF THE ONLY BASTIONS OF </p><p>RESISTANCE TO MUGABE\'S POLICIES IN ZANU-PF, AND WILL </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY BE THE FOCUS OF THE PRESIDENT\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>QUASH DISSENT IN ONE OF ZIMBABWE\'S LARGEST AND MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT PROVINCES.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
