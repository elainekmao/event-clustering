<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000265 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>Department for EAP/BCLTV, EAP/P - K. Bailes </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, VM, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: PROPOSED PRESS GUIDANCE ON DR. QUE\'S DETENTION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HCMC 259 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Post has notified the HCMC External Relations Office </p><p>(ERO), the local branch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, of its </p><p>interest in the case of Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, who was detained in </p><p>HCMC on March 17 (reftel).  We have also requested MFA assistance </p><p>in obtaining additional information on the circumstances of his </p><p>detention and general medical condition.  As of COB March 19, the </p><p>ERO was able to confirm only the basic facts as reported reftel. </p><p>They were unable to provide any further clarification on the </p><p>current status of his case, but have promised to continue to seek </p><p>answers on our behalf in the morning.  Post will continue to press </p><p>for additional details. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  In a telephone conversation with Dr. Que\'s wife the </p><p>afternoon of March 19, she said that she had gone to the Municipal </p><p>Jail today with food, clothing, and medication.  While she had </p><p>been allowed to leave the articles there for Dr. Que, she had not </p><p>been permitted to meet with him.  When she requested an </p><p>opportunity to meet with the Director of the facility, she was </p><p>told that he was in meetings all day.  She plans to return on </p><p>March 20.  In an interesting footnote, an official at the ERO </p><p>mentioned twice today that Post probably had better first-hand </p><p>information on what had happened than the MFA, a likely reference </p><p>to Poloff\'s visit to Dr. Que\'s home the previous evening. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Should the need arise, Post recommends the following </p><p>press guidance, on an "if asked" basis: </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Begin Press Guidance:  The local office of the Ministry </p><p>of Foreign Affairs in Ho Chi Minh City has confirmed that Dr. </p><p>Nguyen Dan Que is currently under detention in Ho Chi Minh City. </p><p>The Consulate General has advised the Ministry of its strong </p><p>interest in the case and asked for additional information on the </p><p>specific circumstances of this prominent democracy activist\'s </p><p>detention.  The Consulate General is unable to speculate on the </p><p>reasons for his detention at this time. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Begin background:  Dr. Que, an endocrinologist, is HCMC\'s </p><p>best-known political dissident.  He was taken to the local police </p><p>station from his home at 8:00 p.m. Tuesday evening, March 18, and </p><p>transferred to the Municipal Jail the following day.  While in </p><p>detention, his home was searched and a number of his possessions </p><p>seized.  His current legal status is not clear. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Background continued:  Dr. Que is 60 years old.  He was </p><p>imprisoned from 1978 to 1988, but was never charged or tried for </p><p>any crime.  In 1990, he was again imprisoned, this time after </p><p>being convicted of attempting to overthrow the government (for </p><p>writing and disseminating pro-democracy materials).  He was </p><p>sentenced to 20 years imprisonment to be followed by 5 years house </p><p>arrest.  He was released in a September 1998 amnesty (the first </p><p>prisoner amnesty that saw the release of significant numbers of </p><p>political prisoners). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Background continued:  Since his release, Dr. Que has </p><p>faced varying degrees of harassment, including steady surveillance </p><p>and monitoring of his activities and communications.  His Internet </p><p>and telephone access is regularly restricted.  Dr. Que suffers </p><p>from a bleeding ulcer and an unspecified kidney ailment, both of </p><p>which require medication. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
