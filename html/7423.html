<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 JEDDAH 000828 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL, LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, RIYADH PLEASE PASS </p><p>TO DHAHRAN </p><p></p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SOCI, KISL, SA </p><p>SUBJECT: TWO SAUDI PROFESSIONALS: BET ON THE PEOPLE, NOT </p><p>THE REGIME </p><p> </p><p>REF: RIYADH 1685 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING CONSUL GENERAL CHARLES RICHE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ON APRIL 2, POLOFF MET WITH A LOCAL SAUDI LAWYER, DR. </p><p>BASIM ALIM (STRICTLY PROTECT), TO DISCUSS HIS OPEN LETTER TO </p><p>CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH CALLING FOR REFORM.  A "SELF-MADE" </p><p>LAWYER, ALIM WAS CHOSEN IN DECEMBER 2002 TO REPRESENT SEVERAL </p><p>SAUDI CHARITIES IN THE SEPTEMBER 11 LAWSUIT AND ADMITS THAT </p><p>HE IS LABELED AN ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST BY MANY.  ALIM SAID </p><p>THAT THE U.S. IS BACKING THE WRONG HORSE (REFERRING TO THE AL </p><p>SAUD), AND THAT AMERICA SHOULD BE SUPPORTING THE PEOPLE. </p><p>DURING THE MEETING, ALIM AND AN ASSOCIATE OF HIS DESCRIBED </p><p>SAUDI SOCIETY AS "AT A BOILING POINT" WARNING THAT "THE </p><p>TABLES WILL TURN, AND WHEN THEY DO, IT WILL HAPPEN QUICKLY, </p><p>AND THE U.S. WILL BE ON THE WRONG SIDE."  ALIM SAID THAT </p><p>THERE ARE PRESENTLY TWO VERY DANGEROUS TRENDS IN THE COUNTRY; </p><p>1) SAUDIS ARE SKEPTICAL AND QUESTIONING THE MOTIVES AND </p><p>STATEMENTS OF THEIR GOVERNMENT, AND 2) THAT PEOPLE HAVE </p><p>BECOME AMBIVALENT TO WHETHER THE AL SAUD STAYS OR GOES.  ALIM </p><p>CONTENDS THAT PRESSURE FROM THE OUTSIDE IS STARTING TO HAVE </p><p>AN IMPACT ON THE AL SAUD, CITING THE RELEASE OF LEADING </p><p>POLITICAL DISSIDENT SHAYKH SAEED BIN ZA\'ER AS AN EXAMPLE (SEE </p><p>REFTEL).  THE TWO MEN ARGUE THAT IT IS NOT TOO LATE FOR THE </p><p>U.S. TO TURN THE TIDE OF ANTI-AMERICAN SENTIMENT IF THE U.S. </p><p>BETS ON THE PEOPLE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WHILE THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY THE TWO MEN ARE NOT </p><p>ENTIRELY NEW, THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF HOW OUT OF TOUCH THE AL </p><p>SAUD ARE WITH THEIR PEOPLE AND HOW THE U.S. CAN WIN BACK THE </p><p>HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE ARABS ARE WORTH NOTING.  MORE THAN </p><p>ANYTHING, HOWEVER, THE MEETING HIGHLIGHTED THE DICHOTOMY THAT </p><p>ARISES WHEN DISCUSSING REFORM WITH HEJAZIS.  WHILE SOME ARGUE </p><p>THAT THE U.S. IS INTERFERING TOO MUCH WITH THE SAUDI </p><p>GOVERNMENT BY PRESSURING THEM TO REFORM, OTHERS ARGUE FOR </p><p>GREATER INTERFERENCE, AND STILL OTHERS SOMEHOW ARGUE FOR </p><p>BOTH.  WE GET ONLY SLIPPERY ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT </p><p>THE "GRASSROOTS" WANTS, IS WILLING TO ACCEPT, AND WHO CAN </p><p>MAKE IT HAPPEN.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BET ON THE PEOPLE, LOOSEN YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE AL SAUD </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON APRIL 2, POLOFF MET WITH DR. BASIM ALIM (STRICTLY </p><p>PROTECT), A "SELF-MADE LAWYER," TO DISCUSS HIS RECENTLY </p><p>PUBLISHED LETTER ADDRESSED TO CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH CALLING </p><p>FOR REFORM.  (NOTE: IN DECEMBER, 2002, ALIM WAS CHOSEN TO </p><p>REPRESENT SEVERAL SAUDI CHARITIES IN THE SEPTEMBER 11 LAWSUIT </p><p>AND ADMITS THAT MANY PEOPLE LABEL HIM AS AN ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST.  END NOTE.)  THE MEETING WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY </p><p>DR. WALED FATEIHI (STRICTLY PROTECT), A U.S. EDUCATED </p><p>PHYSICIAN AND CLOSE FRIEND OF ALIM.  ALIM, WHILE OPEN TO </p><p>DISCUSSING HIS ARTICLE, TOOK MORE INTEREST IN CONVEYING THE </p><p>MESSAGE THAT THE USG NEEDS TO HALT ITS SUPPORT FOR </p><p>GOVERNMENTS THAT GO AGAINST THE PRINCIPLES OF THE U.S. </p><p>CONSTITUTION.  HE BELIEVES THAT THE U.S. IS ACTING AS AN </p><p>ENABLER TO THESE DESPOTIC REGIMES IN THE REGION, WHICH </p><p>ULTIMATELY BREEDS RESENTMENT FROM THE PEOPLE.  HE CONTENDS </p><p>THAT THE AL SAUD HAVE BECOME TOO DEPENDENT ON THE U.S. AND AS </p><p>A RESULT DON\'T ALWAYS HAVE THE PEOPLES\' BEST INTEREST AT </p><p>HEART.  LIKE MANY, ALIM DOES NOT MIND A LIMITED MONARCHY, </p><p>STATING "THEY CAN HAVE THEIR KING, AND APPOINT A FEW PRINCES, </p><p>BUT THAT\'S IT.  THE POWER NEEDS TO BE GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ALIM CONTENDS THAT PRESSURE FROM THE OUTSIDE IS </p><p>STARTING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE AL SAUD, CITING THE RELEASE </p><p>OF LEADING POLITICAL DISSIDENT SHAYKH SAEED BIN ZA\'ER AS AN </p><p>EXAMPLE (SEE REFTEL).  ACCORDING TO ALIM, MIRA, (THE SAUDI </p><p>OPPOSITION GROUP IN LONDON), THREATENED TO FILE A LAWSUIT </p><p>AGAINST THE AL SAUD IN BELGIUM (NFI), AND WHEN THE AL SAUD </p><p>FOUND OUT ABOUT IT, THEY RELEASED AL ZA\'ER.  ALIM BELIEVES </p><p>THAT REFORM PETITIONS AND LETTERS LIKE HIS WOULD CARRY </p><p>GREATER WEIGHT IF THERE WAS MORE PRESSURE ON THE AL SAUD.  HE </p><p>EVEN WENT AS FAR AS TO SUGGEST THAT THE U.S. CONSIDER PLACING </p><p>SANCTIONS ON THE KINGDOM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ALIM AND FATEIHI BELIEVE THAT IN ANY SOCIETY, FIVE </p><p>PERCENT OF POPULATION, "THE INTELLIGENTSIA", FORCE THE SYSTEM </p><p>ARGUE THAT THEY CAN DO IT BUT THEY NEED THE U.S. TO "SUPPORT </p><p>THE PEOPLE, AND TO BET ON THE PEOPLE.  WE HAVE OUR OWN BEN </p><p>FRANKLINS AND JOHN HANCOCKS, BUT YOU NEED TO GIVE US A CHANCE." </p><p>FATEIHI URGED A REGIONAL CHANGE STATING THAT "IF THE U.S. DOES </p><p>NOT LOOK TO FORCE OTHER REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO CHANGE LIKE THE </p><p>U.S. IS DOING IN IRAQ, IT WILL HAVE ALL BEEN FOR NOTHING." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) BOTH MEN, WHO HAVE SPENT DECADES IN THE STATES AS </p><p>STUDENTS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS, ARE SADDENED BY THE </p><p>ANTI-U.S. SENTIMENT THAT HAS ONLY GROWN OVER THE YEARS IN THE </p><p>ARAB AND MUSLIM WORLD.  "I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD GET TO </p><p>THIS.  BUT IT IS NOT TOO LATE.  ARABS ARE VERY EMOTIONAL </p><p>PEOPLE, AND IF YOU TAKE A STAND AGAINST THESE DESPOTIC </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, THE PEOPLE WILL BE WITH YOU."  POLOFF, CITING </p><p>THE INTERNAL RELIGIOUS AND TRADITIONAL STRIFE IN THE COUNTRY, </p><p>ASKED IF THEY FELT CONFIDENT THAT THEY KNEW WHAT THE </p><p>GRASSROOTS LEVEL WANTED, AND WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO GET "THE </p><p>REST TO FOLLOW."  WITHOUT PROVIDING DETAILS, THEY SAID THAT </p><p>THEY KNEW WHAT THE GRASSROOTS WANTED AND KNEW WHAT THE </p><p>ALLOWABLE PARAMETERS OF CHANGE WERE IN THE KINGDOM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EQUALITY AND DIGNITY. . . ALL ELEMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) RECALLING THEIR ADMIRATION FOR THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, </p><p>ALIM AND FATEIHI ARGUED THAT WHAT SAUDIS REALLY WANT IS </p><p>EQUALITY.  THEY WANT TO BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO SUCCEED AND WANT </p><p>THEIR DIGNITY BACK.  ALIM SAID THAT "THE AL SAUD HAVE </p><p>SQUEEZED OUT THE LITTLE PEOPLE AND HAVE THEIR TENTACLES IN </p><p>EVERYTHING.  UNDER EVERY STONE IS A PRINCE, AND THEY ARE OUT </p><p>OF TOUCH WITH THEIR PEOPLE."  ALIM SAID THAT THERE ARE </p><p>PRESENTLY TWO VERY DANGEROUS TRENDS IN THE COUNTRY; 1) SAUDIS </p><p>ARE SKEPTICAL AND QUESTIONING THE MOTIVES AND STATEMENTS OF </p><p>THEIR GOVERNMENT, AND 2) THAT PEOPLE HAVE BECOME AMBIVALENT </p><p>TO WHETHER THE AL SAUD STAYS OR GOES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) ALIM CRITICIZED A RECENT STATEMENT GIVEN BY PRINCE </p><p>SULTAN WHOM HE REPORTED AS SAYING, "EVEN SOMEONE FROM JIZAN </p><p>CAN COME SEE ME."  ALIM FOUND THIS STATEMENT TO BE HIGHLY </p><p>INSULTING, PARTICULARLY TO THE JIZANIS, BECAUSE IT INSINUATED </p><p>THAT THEY ARE THE LOWEST OF THE LOW IN THE KINGDOM BUT STILL </p><p>CAN CONSIDER THEMSELVES PRIVILEGED ENOUGH TO MEET A POWERFUL </p><p>PRINCE.  THEY WERE ALSO CRITICAL OF SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>SAUD AL-FAISAL DURING A RECENT PRESS BRIEFING.  APPARENTLY, A </p><p>FEMALE SAUDI JOURNALIST ASKED THE FOREIGN MINISTER IF HE HAD </p><p>SEEN THE DEPARTMENT\'S HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>TWO MEN, HE COMPLETELY DISMISSED HER AND JUST REPLIED QUITE </p><p>TERSELY, "NO."  THEY RESENT THAT SAUD AL-FAISAL WOULD BE SO </p><p>SHORT WITH A SAUDI CITIZEN, AND INTERPRET IT AS AN </p><p>INSINUATION FROM THE FM THAT SAUDIS SHOULD NOT BE CONCERNED </p><p>WITH HUMAN RIGHTS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE QUESTION HAD </p><p>COME FROM A WESTERN REPORTER, SAUD AL-FAISAL\'S RESPONSE WOULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN HANDLED MUCH DIFFERENTLY, ACCORDING TO FATEIHI. </p><p>(COMMENT:  POLOFF HAS RECENTLY HEARD CRITICISM REGARDING SAUD </p><p>AL-FAISAL\'S PRESS CONFERENCES.  LOCAL JOURNALISTS PERCEIVE </p><p>THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTER INCREASINGLY CATERS TO THE FOREIGN </p><p>MEDIA AND TELLS THEM THAT THE SAG IS INTERESTED IN REFORM AND </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT DOES NOT TAKE THE SAME INTEREST IN </p><p>DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES WITH LOCAL REPORTERS, AND SOMETIMES </p><p>DELIVERS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MESSAGE ALL TOGETHER.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>ALIM\'S IDEAS FOR REFORM </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) HERE ARE VERBATIM EXCERPTS OF DR. ALIM\'S LETTER TO </p><p>THE CROWN PRINCE THAT APPEARED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE DAILY, </p><p>ARAB NEWS ON MARCH 23, 2003.  (NOTE: THE ARTICLE ORIGINALLY </p><p>RAN IN THE ARABIC DAILY, AL MADINA. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT </p><p> </p><p>YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS, </p><p>AN UNJUST WAR HAS BEGUN AND THE KINGDOM MUST MOVE FROM A </p><p>STATE OF INACTION TO ONE OF POSITIVE CONFRONTATION AGAINST </p><p>ANY AGGRESSOR WHO VIOLATES THE SOVEREIGNTY AND SANCTITY OF </p><p>COUNTRIES AND MURDERS OUR BRETHREN WHEREVER THEY ARE.  ON THE </p><p>INTERNAL FRONT, WE HOPE TO SEE EACH INDIVIDUAL FASHIONED TO </p><p>BECOME PART AND PARCEL OF HIS NATION, AWARE OF HIS </p><p>SERVED BY HAILING AND PRAISING BUT FOUND IN THE HEARTS OF THE </p><p>FAITHFUL AND THE SINCERE WORKING TO DELIVER THEIR COUNTRY AND </p><p>NATION FROM ALL THREATS.  YOUR HIGHNESS, EVERY CITIZEN IS </p><p>WILLING TO OFFER ALL THEY POSSESS, INCLUDING THEIR LIVES, IF </p><p>THE CONVICTION IS CREATED INSIDE THEM THAT SINCERITY PREVAILS </p><p>FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.  EVERY INDIVIDUAL MUST SENSE THIS </p><p>EQUALITY AS REALITY, WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION AND FAVORITISM </p><p>FOR ANYONE, NO MATTER WHO THEY MIGHT BE.  IT IS TIME TO </p><p>ENERGIZE AND ACTIVATE OUR CIVIL INSTITUTIONS SO THEY MAY PLAY </p><p>A MORE SUPPORTIVE ROLE IN SERVING THE NATION\'S INTERESTS AND </p><p>STIMULATING LEADERSHIP POLICIES.  THE CALL FOR INCORPORATING </p><p>FREEDOM OF CHOICE, ACCOUNTABILITY, FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PLURALISM AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO PLAY </p><p>A MORE ACTIVE ROLE, ALL THIS COMES WITHIN OUR RELIGIOUS </p><p>TEACHINGS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) YOUR HIGHNESS, OUR YOUTH NEED TO BE DIRECTED BY </p><p>PLANTING IN THEM THE NOBLE CHARACTERS THAT THE PROPHET </p><p>MUHAMMAD PEACE BE UPON HIM, SET FOR THE NATION\'S YOUTH.  THIS </p><p>CAN BE DONE NOT ONLY THROUGH MILITARY SERVICE BUT THOUGH </p><p>ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN COMMUNITY SERVICE.  I APPEAL TO YOUR </p><p>HIGHNESS TO OPEN THE WAY FOR AN EXTENSIVE POPULAR EFFORT ON </p><p>ALL FRONTS IN SUPPORT OF OUR NATION SO THAT IT WILL BE ABLE </p><p>TO REPULSE THE RISKS DESCENDING ON IT FROM ALL SIDES.  WE </p><p>HOPE YOU WILL REWARD THE HAND THAT IS BEING STRETCHED OUT IN </p><p>UNITY SO THAT WE CAN STAND TOGETHER IN THE FACE OF DANGER. </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION.  ALIM IS MARRIED AND HAS </p><p>CHILDREN.  HE RECEIVED HIS LAW DEGREE FROM HARVARD AND HIS </p><p>PH.D. FROM AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.  HE IS VERY PROUD OF THE FACT </p><p>THAT HE STARTED HIS OWN LAW PRACTICE AND HAS HIS FIRST CHECK </p><p>FRAMED ON THE WALL IN HIS OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RICHE </p><p></p></div>
