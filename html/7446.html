<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000935 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, DRL, DRL/PHD, AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  Lay Assessors:  More symbolic than useful </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  "Lay assessors" in courts below the </p><p>appellate level are Vietnam\'s rough equivalent of trial by </p><p>jury.  Officials describe this system as an example of the </p><p>GVN\'s commitment to promote public democracy.  Training </p><p>remains inadequate and is likely to continue to be </p><p>underfunded, virtually ensuring that their contribution to </p><p>justice will be weak or marginal.  Senior court officials </p><p>claim that lay assessors are "not very helpful" at best, and </p><p>even "bothersome" in complicated, high profile cases, where </p><p>they tend to be influenced "excessively" by public opinion. </p><p>Court officials may more truly fear trial panelists </p><p>independently making decisions in opposition to </p><p>government/party guidance. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>What Lay Assessors Do </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) According to Vietnam\'s Criminal Procedure Code, </p><p>criminal cases at district and provincial trial courts are </p><p>heard by a judging panel composed of three members:  a chief </p><p>-- who must be a judge -- and two "lay assessors" (hoi tham </p><p>nhan dan).  The law requires that the two lay assessors be </p><p>independent but equal to the judge.  As such, any </p><p>disagreements among the three members of a judging panel  -- </p><p>for example, on sentencing -- must be resolved by a majority </p><p>vote.  In theory, the lay assessors can easily outvote a </p><p>trained, qualified judge. (Note:  Many judges in Vietnam </p><p>also lack adequate training, a problem that the USG is </p><p>helping to redress in the context of USAID\'s USD8 million </p><p>Support for Trade Adjustment Reform assistance program to </p><p>implement the Bilateral Trade Agreement.  End note) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  According to Tran Ngoc Nhan, Director of the </p><p>Democracy and Law Department of the Vietnam Fatherland Front </p><p>(VFF), lay assessors are supposed to represent the "common </p><p>citizen" at court trials, to speak up for the common people </p><p>regarding the seriousness of cases and subsequent </p><p>sentencing, and to ensure that court rulings are "reasonable </p><p>and just."  Lay assessors are not involved in appeals </p><p>trials. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Choosing Lay Assessors </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) By law, VFF committees at district and provincial </p><p>level, in coordinating with the Standing Boards of the </p><p>People\'s Councils, are responsible for identifying </p><p>candidates to serve five-year terms as lay assessors. </p><p>Frequently, local VFF committees nominate retired government </p><p>and mass organization officials.  At the first session of </p><p>each new People\'s Council at the district and provincial </p><p>level every five years, each Council endorses a formal list </p><p>of lay assessors.  VFF guidelines distributed three years </p><p>ago recommended that -- in order to "enhance democracy" -- </p><p>there be more candidates than there are positions.  VFF </p><p>officials indicated that this guideline is "often" but not </p><p>always implemented. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  According to the VFF, a district-level court </p><p>typically has 3 judges and a pool of about 30-35 lay </p><p>assessors.  The lay assessors receive only 10-20,000 </p><p>Vietnamese dong (roughly $0.65-1.30) per trial, although </p><p>these sums apparently may be increased during unusually long </p><p>trials.  They also must pay for their own transportation. </p><p>Lay assessors in mountainous or remote areas -- where it may </p><p>take half a day for a lay assessor to get to the court for a </p><p>one-hour trial -- receive an extra 20,000 dong per day. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Military Assessors </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Military Assessors are the Military Court system\'s </p><p>equivalent of lay assessors.  The Chairman of the Ministry </p><p>of Defense\'s General Political Department chooses pools of </p><p>military assessors for Military Zone Courts from among </p><p>serving military officers nominated by zone-level military </p><p>political departments.  Likewise, zone-level military </p><p>political chairmen choose military assessors to serve on the </p><p>lower level Military Area Courts.  Military assessors also </p><p>serve five-year terms.  According to a senior Supreme </p><p>People\'s Court official, it is often difficult to persuade </p><p>military officers to agree to serve as Military Assessors. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Picking from the Pools </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The Presiding Judge of each court picks lay assessors </p><p>from its pool for each trial.  According to VFF officials, a </p><p>lay assessor attached to a court at district level typically </p><p>serves once or twice a year, while provincial lay assessors </p><p>serve somewhat more frequently.  Officials of the central </p><p>VFF said that VFF guidance stressed that each pool of lay </p><p>assessors must include a variety of professional backgrounds </p><p>and represent different geographical units within a </p><p>jurisdiction.  This is to ensure that lay assessors with a </p><p>variety of professional backgrounds are available, that lay </p><p>assessors have "something in common" with the defendants, </p><p>and that defendant\'s home community is represented.  VFF </p><p>officials gave two examples:  first, if the defendant is a </p><p>student, then one of the two lay assessors should be a </p><p>teacher, or at least someone with an education background; </p><p>second, if the defendant is a woman from a particular </p><p>community, then one of the two lay assessors should be a </p><p>woman with responsibility for women\'s issues in that </p><p>community. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Problems with the system </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Both VFF and court officials stated that many, if not </p><p>most, lay assessors are too poorly educated about legal </p><p>issues to conduct fair and forthright discussions with </p><p>judges.  Thus, in most ordinary trials, lay assessors tend </p><p>to "cave in" to judges because they do not have sufficient </p><p>knowledge to debate points of law.  According to VFF\'s Nhan, </p><p>lay assessors tend to become "yes-men," a problem </p><p>exacerbated by the fact that their experience builds rather </p><p>slowly due to non-regular service. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) According to national-level VFF officials, both local </p><p>administrations and courts "neglect" lay assessors and do </p><p>not provide adequate training opportunities.  The only </p><p>mandatory training is a one-day session conducted in the </p><p>framework of the opening of the local People\'s Council.  The </p><p>only other formal, systematic training occurs when local </p><p>courts provide seminars on major law changes.  Given their </p><p>token salaries, the lay assessors have no financial </p><p>incentive to improve their knowledge of the law. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Court Officials:  Little use for Lay Assessors </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) According to Ngo Cuong, deputy director of the </p><p>Judicial Science Institute of the Supreme People\'s Court, </p><p>the current system of lay assessors is, at best, "not very </p><p>useful" and, in some cases, is even "bothersome" to the </p><p>judicial system.  Cuong admitted that court officials have </p><p>privately discussed how they should abandon the lay assessor </p><p>system entirely. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU)  The worst problems, according to Cuong, occur </p><p>when lay assessors participate in complicated and high </p><p>profile cases.  Under "media pressure," lay assessors often </p><p>merely echo public opinion, and behave "subjectively," </p><p>paying little attention to interpretation of law articles, </p><p>particularly regarding sentencing.  In such cases, judges </p><p>frequently have difficulty convincing lay assessors to agree </p><p>with them.  Consequently, the judging panel makes decisions </p><p>according to the majority opinions of the lay assessors </p><p>rather than the actual law, Cuong complained.  He alleged </p><p>that this had led to many "unnecessarily harsh sentences." </p><p>In these circumstances, all a judge could do was report </p><p>"excessively strict rulings" to his/her superiors.  However, </p><p>such reports are only relevant if the defendant decided to </p><p>appeal, Cuong noted. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Cuong added that court officials have not dared to </p><p>speak openly about abolishing the lay assessor system, </p><p>because the VFF strongly and vocally supports the system, </p><p>calling it a "good reflection of the Party\'s and State\'s </p><p>policies to promote public democracy."  Central VFF </p><p>officials compared their lay assessors to US jurors, </p><p>claiming that "they are identical."  Court officials, on the </p><p>other hand, said Vietnam\'s current lay assessors system was </p><p>more like China\'s.  "Now that China is working on </p><p>diminishing the importance of their lay assessors, we should </p><p>do the same," said a senior expert from the Supreme People\'s </p><p>Court. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  In 1994, the Supreme People\'s Court succeeded in </p><p>pushing for a change in the specialized Economic and </p><p>Administrative courts.  At that time, the Standing Committee </p><p>of the National Assembly passed an ordinance setting the </p><p>composition of judging panels in these courts at one lay </p><p>assessor and two judges.  According to Cuong, the change was </p><p>"decisive," and has prevented lay assessors from being able </p><p>negatively to affect rulings in those courts.  A circular </p><p>recently signed between the central VFF and the Supreme </p><p>People\'s Court, Ministry of Home Affairs, and Ministry of </p><p>Defense regarding judges and lay assessors called for more </p><p>coordination between the VFF and these courts; officials </p><p>noted that it remains unclear whether the circular will have </p><p>any practical impact. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU)  One court official claimed that the Supreme </p><p>People\'s Court would like National Assembly to make a </p><p>similar modification to the Criminal Procedure Code to </p><p>change the balance of criminal trial panels also to two </p><p>judges and one lay assessor.  However, the courts are </p><p>reluctant to discuss this openly, because they fear even </p><p>suggesting diminishing the role of lay assessors will spark </p><p>a fierce reaction from the VFF, the official admitted. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Comment:  It is very unlikely that Vietnam\'s </p><p>courts will modify, let alone drop, the current system of </p><p>lay assessors any time soon, given their symbolic role.  The </p><p>VFF strongly defends the existing system, while agitating </p><p>for more attention from relevant offices and agencies to </p><p>strengthen it.  However, given the lack of financial </p><p>resources even to improve the quality of judges, there is </p><p>little reason to expect much progress on lay assessor </p><p>training.  It is also telling that Vietnamese legal experts, </p><p>while in principle eager to move Vietnam more squarely </p><p>toward a "law governed society" if not necessarily true </p><p>"rule by law," appear nervous about trial panelists who may </p><p>be voting their own conscience rather than following </p><p>"guidance" from the courts (or their party cells). </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
