<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 003904 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MOPS, PHUM, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI MFA INSPECTION TEAM TO RECOMMEND REOPENING </p><p>IRAQI EMBASSY IN AMMAN FOR CONSULAR SERVICES </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 156956 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  PolCouns met June 26 with the members of the Iraqi </p><p>MFA\'s inspection team, Amb. Zaid Noori and Abdul Baqi Ismail </p><p>Ali (ref).  Noori said that they had no trouble getting into </p><p>the Iraqi Embassy in Amman on June 25 and had found the </p><p>morale of the Iraqi staff quite high, "since all the </p><p>intelligence people have left and only real MFA people </p><p>remain."   Ali, who Noori described as "the most senior </p><p>financial inspector in the MFA," had just begun his </p><p>examination of the accounts of the Iraqi Embassy and could </p><p>not yet draw any conclusions.  Ali said that, from records in </p><p>Baghdad, there was a real possibility that the Iraqi </p><p>embassies in Beirut and Damascus had been used to collect and </p><p>funnel to Baghdad kickbacks from illegally smuggled oil. </p><p>Noori and Ali hoped to travel to Beirut on June 28, then on </p><p>to Damascus June 30 or July 1 to conduct preliminary embassy </p><p>inspections there. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Noori related that they had discovered a quantity of </p><p>handguns, AK-47\'s, and ammunition "inappropriate for a </p><p>diplomatic mission" stored at the Iraqi Embassy compound.  He </p><p>said that he would almost certainly ask the Jordanian </p><p>government to take possession of the weapons for safekeeping </p><p>until a new Iraqi government could decide on what to do with </p><p>them.  In the meantime, he had recorded all of the serial </p><p>numbers of the weapons and, on his return to Baghdad, would </p><p>try to determine their origin within the Iraqi government. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Noori said that a second key goal of their mission </p><p>to Amman was to look at the possibility of reopening consular </p><p>services for the Iraqi community in Jordan, which he </p><p>estimated at 300,000.  He said that many of the Iraqis who </p><p>had traveled from Jordan to Iraq after the war had done so on </p><p>expired passports.  Since the MFA is not yet issuing new </p><p>passports, those Iraqis do not have the travel documents </p><p>needed to gain entry into other countries.  Noori said he </p><p>would recommend to the MFA\'s Steering Committee in Baghdad </p><p>that the Iraqi Embassy in Amman reopen for consular services </p><p>as soon as possible, and that the CPA consider issuing some </p><p>type of temporary travel documents to permit Iraqis to enter </p><p>and leave Iraq until formal passports are issued. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
