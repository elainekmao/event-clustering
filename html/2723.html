(SBU) SUMMARY:  SIX WEEKS AFTER THEIR UNHCR REPATRIATION </p><p>AND THE ONSET OF REALITY, ETHNIC MINORITY RETURNEES HAVE </p><p>OPENLY ARTICULATED THEIR REASONS FOR LEAVING VIETNAM FOR </p><p>CAMBODIA - LACK OF FARMLAND, AND TO A SOMEWHAT LESSER </p><p>EXTENT, RELIGION.  ALL SIX OF THE UNHCR RETURNEES WE SPOKE </p><p>TO ON A RECENT TRIP TO KON TUM PROVINCE ASKED FOR UNHCR TO </p><p>BEGIN ITS FOLLOW-UP MONITORING OF THEIR SITUATIONS AS SOON </p><p>AS POSSIBLE.  TWO SAID THEY LIVED IN FEAR.  THE ONE </p><p>"SPONTANEOUS, VOLUNTARY RETURNEE" WE SPOKE TO CLEARLY </p><p>REGRETTED HIS DECISION TO RETURN TO GIA LAI PROVINCE. </p><p>ANOTHER VILLAGER WHO "HAD THOUGHT ABOUT" LEAVING FOR </p><p>CAMBODIA CHANGED HIS MIND WHEN HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS </p><p>ARRESTED FOR TRYING TO CROSS THE BORDER AND BEATEN.  YET </p><p>ANOTHER VILLAGER SAID SHE HOPED HER HUSBAND, A HOUSE CHURCH </p><p>PREACHER, WOULD NOT RETURN BECAUSE IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS. </p><p>WHILE SOME PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS SEEMED SENSITIVE TO LAND </p><p>ISSUES AND TENSIONS BETWEEN ETHNIC MINORITIES AND THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE KINH MAJORITY, THE LACK OF RESOURCES, AN </p><p>UNIMAGINATIVE BUREAUCRACY, AND WEAK POLITICAL DIRECTION HAVE </p><p>HAMPERED EFFORTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  THIS MESSAGE </p><p>PROVIDES A MORE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE SAME TRIP DISCUSSED </p><p>BY AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT IN REFTEL A.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) AMBASSADOR AND CONGENOFFS VISITED THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS PROVINCES OF KON TUM AND GIA LAI, MARCH 30 THROUGH </p><p>APRIL 1.  PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES CONCEDED VIRTUALLY </p><p>UNLIMITED ACCESS TO THE UNHCR RETURNEES IN KON TUM.  IN RAC </p><p>VILLAGE, THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH SIX OF THE 15 UNHCR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00336  01 OF 02  060300Z </p><p>RETURNEES - TWO OF WHOM HAD MET WITH CONGENOFFS BACK ON </p><p>MARCH 1.  THIS TIME THEIR STORY WAS DIFFERENT.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THESE VILLAGERS, THEY FACED DISCRIMINATION AND INTIMIDATION </p><p>AFTER THEIR RETURN.  LAND PROBLEMS WERE NOW SEEMINGLY </p><p>INTRACTABLE -- UNFERTILE LAND IN ROCKY SOIL ON STEEP HILLS </p><p>AT BEST; LAND THE VILLAGERS HAD HAD TAKEN AWAY BY VILLAGE </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO ESTABLISH NEW ECONOMIC ZONES OR GIVEN TO </p><p>RECENT VIETNAMESE KINH MIGRANTS AT WORST.  KON TUM OFFICIALS </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THEY WERE TWO YEARS BEHIND IN PROVIDING LAND </p><p>COMPENSATION FOR SOME VILLAGES, BUT SAID THEY HAD ALREADY </p><p>RESETTLED SEVERAL VILLAGES IN NEW LOCATIONS, BUILT STURDY </p><p>HOUSES AND ALLOCATED VIABLE FARMLAND. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) SPEAKING OPENLY IN FRONT OF DISTRICT/VILLAGE </p><p>LEADERS, LOCAL MEDIA, AND OTHER VILLAGERS, ONE 24-YEAR OLD </p><p>UNHCR RETURNEE STATED THAT LAND PROBLEMS WERE AT THE HEART </p><p>OF HIS DISCONTENT.  EVEN WITH SOME FELLOW VILLAGERS </p><p>EXPRESSING DISAGREEMENT AND TRYING TO SHUSH HIM UP, THIS </p><p>RETURNEE WAS DEFIANT: "I WANT MY FRIENDS TO COME UP HERE AND </p><p>LISTEN BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH.  THEY </p><p>CAN ALSO SHARE THEIR OPINIONS.  I DO NOT WANT THEM TO </p><p>COMPLAIN LATER THAT I HAVE SAID TOO MUCH. . . . .MY LAND WAS </p><p>NOT FERTILE AND MY LIVELIHOOD WAS TOO UNSTABLE."  HE SAID </p><p>SINCE HIS FEBRUARY 19 RETURN AFTER FIVE MONTHS IN A CAMP, HE </p><p>HAS NOT HAD ANY LAND TO FARM. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) TWO OTHER UNHCR RETURNEES (ONE WHO HAD BEEN SICK </p><p>WHEN CONGENOFFS VISITED ON MARCH 1, AND THE SECOND VERY </p><p>UNCOMMUNICATIVE THE FIRST TIME AROUND) NODDED IN AGREEMENT. </p><p>ALL THREE ARE PROTESTANTS.  ONE MENTIONED RELIGION AS A </p><p>PROBLEM, BUT IN A RATHER CONVOLUTED WAY:  "MY LAND WAS NOT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00336  01 OF 02  060300Z </p><p>PRODUCING MUCH, OTHER THINGS WERE GOING WRONG IN MY LIFE </p><p>WITH MONEY AND MY COW AND CHICKENS DIED, SO I PRAYED TO THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL DEITIES." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) A LATECOMER TO THE GROUP, HOWEVER, EXPLICITLY </p><p>STATED THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE FLED TO CAMBODIA IF HE HAD NOT </p><p>FEARED BEING ARRESTED BECAUSE HE WAS A RECENT CONVERT TO </p><p>PROTESTANTISM. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) NONE OF THESE UNHCR RETURNEES EXPECTED ANY MORE OF </p><p>THE 39 VILLAGERS WHO HAD LEFT FOR CAMBODIA TO RETURN - NOR </p><p>WOULD THEY ENCOURAGE THEM TO, INCLUDING ONE RETURNEE WHOSE </p><p>SON IS STILL IN MONDOLKIRI CAMP.  TWO RETURNEES WHO HAD </p><p>COMPLETED SOME SCHOOLING SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD THEIR THREE </p><p>OPTIONS ON REPATRIATION AND MADE A CHOICE TO RETURN TO </p><p>VIETNAM.  TWO YOUNGER RETURNEES WITH NO/NO SCHOOLING - WHILE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THEY WANTED TO RETURN TO VIETNAM - SAID THEY </p><p>DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE THREE OPTIONS, NOR THE PAPER THEY </p><p>WERE ASKED TO SIGN IN THE CAMP. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) TWO RETURNEES GAVE LETTERS TO THE AMBASSADOR FOR </p><p>TRANSMITTAL TO UNHCR, IN WHICH THEY CLAIMED DISCRIMINATION </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION.  THEY PLEADED WITH UNHCR TO START THEIR </p><p>FOLLOW-UP MONITORING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  "YES, YOU MUST </p><p>COME VISIT OUR VILLAGE AGAIN," ALL SIX RETURNEES URGED </p><p>CONGENOFFS." </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) VISITING PUIH VILLAGE IN GIA LAI PROVINCE, THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND CONGENOFFS MET WITH A VARIETY OF VILLAGERS. </p><p>THE "SPONTANEOUS" VOLUNTARY RETURNEE WAS QUIET AND NOT READY </p><p>TO ANSWER TOO MANY QUESTIONS.  HE HAD RETURNED WITH 29 </p><p>OTHERS JUST ONE WEEK AGO.  HE SAID HE HAD PARTICIPATED IN </p><p>THE FEBRUARY 2001 DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST AUTHORITIES WHO HAD </p><p>TAKEN HIS LAND.  ACCORDING TO HIM, VILLAGE OFFICIALS </p><p>DEMANDED 200-300 SQUARE METERS FROM CERTAIN VILLAGERS ("NOT </p><p>EVERYBODY, JUST SOME") FOR A PURPORTED COFFEE PLANTATION </p><p>THAT WOULD PROVIDE MORE EMPLOYMENT FOR THE ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES.  IN FACT, THE LAND WENT TO "OTHER (VIETNAMESE </p><p>KINH) INDIVIDUALS."  ANOTHER VILLAGER SAID HE HAD THOUGHT </p><p>ABOUT GOING TO CAMBODIA HIMSELF, BUT CHANGED HIS MIND AFTER </p><p>HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS ARRESTED LEAVING THE VILLAGE FOR THE </p><p>BORDER AND WAS BEATEN.  YET A THIRD VILLAGER DESCRIBED HOW </p><p>HER HUSBAND, A HOUSE CHURCH PREACHER, HAD BEEN DETAINED AND </p><p>BEATEN FOR A WEEK.  AFTER HIS RELEASE, HE DECIDED TO GO TO </p><p>CAMBODIA.  THE WIFE DOES NOT EXPECT HIM TO RETURN, NOR DOES </p><p>SHE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE SAFE IN ANY CASE. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) CONVERSATIONS AT BOTH VILLAGES WERE MARKED BY SOME </p><p>UNEASE, BUT ALSO FRANKNESS AND COURAGE.  SOCIAL TENSIONS </p><p>BETWEEN THE ETHNIC MINORITIES AND THE VIETNAMESE KINH, THE </p><p>INFLUX OF VIETNAMESE KINH MIGRANTS FROM THE NORTH, </p><p>SUBSISTENCE AGRICULTURE AND PRACTICING PLANTATION </p><p>AGRICULTURE ON OVERWORKED AND SHRINKING PARCELS OF LAND HAVE </p><p>MADE THE ALREADY HAND-TO-MOUTH EXISTENCE OF THE VILLAGERS </p><p>EVEN MORE UNBEARABLE.  COMPARED TO BARELY A MONTH AGO, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00336  02 OF 02  060300Z </p><p>CONGENOFFS BELIEVE THE MOOD IN AT LEAST RAC VILLAGE HAS </p><p>WORSENED IN TERMS OF DESPERATION FOR OUTSIDE HELP. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
