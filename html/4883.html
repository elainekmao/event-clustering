AS A RESULT OF THE LOWERING OF </p><p>TARIFFS FROM AN AVERAGE OF 40 PERCENT TO AN AVERAGE OF 3 </p><p>PERCENT, VIETNAMESE EXPORTS TO THE U.S. HAVE INCREASED </p><p>RAPIDLY OVER THE LAST YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002, THE US TRADE DEFICIT WITH </p><p>VIETNAM WAS USD 1.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF USD 796 MILLION </p><p>FROM THE US TRADE DEFICIT IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2001. </p><p>THE EXPORTS OF US GOODS TO VIETNAM WERE $343 MILLION IN THE </p><p>FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002, AN INCREASE OF $80 MILLION (30 </p><p>PERCENT) FROM THE LEVEL OF US EXPORTS TO VIETNAM DURING THE </p><p>SAME PERIOD IN 2001.  VIETNAM WAS THE UNITED STATES\' 68TH </p><p>LARGEST EXPORT MARKET IN 2002.  US IMPORTS FROM VIETNAM WERE </p><p>$1.57 BILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002, AN INCREASE </p><p>OF $835 MILLION (113 PERCENT) FROM THE LEVEL OF IMPORTS IN </p><p>2001. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM (GVN) FIGURES, THE STOCK </p><p>OF US FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IN VIETNAM THROUGH MAY </p><p>2002 AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY USD 500 MILLION.

CURRENTLY, THERE ARE THREE </p><p>SETS OF TARIFF RATES:  MFN RATES THAT APPLY TO ABOUT 75 </p><p>PERCENT OF TOTAL IMPORTS, INCLUDING US IMPORTS; COMMON </p><p>EFFECTIVE PREFERENTIAL TARIFF  (CEPT) RATES THAT APPLY TO </p><p>IMPORTS FROM ASEAN COUNTRIES; AND GENERAL TARIFF RATES (50% </p><p>HIGHER THAN MFN) THAT APPLY TO ALL OTHER COUNTRIES </p><p>(INCLUDING MEXICO, ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL).  THE AVERAGE (UN- </p><p>WEIGHTED) MFN TARIFF RATE HAS INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS AS </p><p>VIETNAM MOVES TO CONVERT QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS TO </p><p>TARIFFS; IN 2002 IT STOOD AT 15.7 PERCENT.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>NUMBER OF TARIFF LINES AND THE MAXIMUM TARIFF RATE HAVE </p><p>DECREASED.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE US-VIETNAM BILATERAL </p><p>TRADE AGREEMENT, VIETNAM IS OBLIGATED SIGNIFICANTLY TO </p><p>REDUCE TARIFFS BY AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT ONE-THIRD TO ONE-HALF </p><p>ON A BROAD RANGE OF US IMPORTS OVER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. </p><p>THE AVERAGE (UNWEIGHTED) CEPT RATE WAS 10.7% IN 2002 AND IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO THREE PERCENT BY 2006. </p><p> </p><p>BEYOND FORMAL TARIFFS, VIETNAM APPLIES "PRICE DIFFERENTIAL </p><p>SURCHARGES" ON SOME PRODUCTS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO FIXED </p><p>LIST OF GOODS SUBJECT TO THESE SURCHARGES.  IN PRINCIPLE, </p><p>THESE SURCHARGES ARE APPLIED TO BOTH IMPORT AND EXPORT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  03098  01 OF 08  301021Z </p><p>PRODUCTS WHERE THERE EXISTS A MAJOR DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE </p><p>DOMESTIC AND WORLD PRICES AS A RESULT OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FLUCTUATIONS.  IMPORT SURCHARGES RANGE FROM FOUR TO 40 </p><p>PERCENT AND ARE IMPOSED MAINLY ON "SENSITIVE" PRODUCTS SUCH </p><p>AS GLASSWARE, CONSTRUCTION GLASS, PAPER, STEEL, CERAMIC </p><p>PRODUCTS AND ALCOHOLIC GOODS. </p><p> </p><p>NON-TARIFF BARRIERS </p><p> </p><p>NON-TARIFF BARRIERS WERE INTRODUCED IN VIETNAM WHEN THE </p><p>COUNTRY SHIFTED FROM CMEA TO MARKET TRADE IN THE LATE 1980S </p><p>AND EARLY 1990S AND QUICKLY BECAME A KEY COMPONENT OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S TRADE POLICY.  IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, VIETNAM HAS </p><p>MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN REDUCING THE USE OF NTBS AND, </p><p>UNDER THE TERMS OF THE BTA, VIETNAM AGREED TO ELIMINATE ALL </p><p>NON-TARIFF BARRIERS, INCLUDING IMPORT AND EXPORT </p><p>RESTRICTIONS, QUOTAS, LICENSING REQUIREMENTS, AND CONTROLS </p><p>FOR ALL PRODUCT AND SERVICE CATEGORIES OVER A PERIOD OF </p><p>THREE TO SEVEN YEARS, DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT. </p><p> </p><p>IMPORT PROHIBITIONS:  VIETNAM CURRENTLY PROHIBITS THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL IMPORTATION OF THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS:  ARMS AND </p><p>AMMUNITION, EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS (NOT INCLUDING INDUSTRIAL </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3671 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  03098  02 OF 08  301021Z </p><p>ACTION CIP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EB-00    E-00     UTED-00  FCC-01   TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     MOFM-05  MOF-01   NSAE-00  OES-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------1E00FA  301021Z /38 </p><p>O 300934Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8490 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 08 HANOI 003098 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/GLORIA BLUE </p><p>STATE FOR EB/MTA/MST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EXPLOSIVES), MILITARY TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES, </p><p>NARCOTICS, TOXIC CHEMICALS, "DEPRAVED AND REACTIONARY" </p><p>CULTURAL PRODUCTS, FIRECRACKERS, SOME CHILDREN\'S TOYS, </p><p>CIGARETTES, SECOND-HAND CONSUMER GOODS, RIGHT-HAND DRIVE </p><p>MOTOR VEHICLES, USED MOTOR VEHICLES AND PARTS, USED INTERNAL </p><p>COMBUSTION ENGINES OF LESS THAN 30 HORSEPOWER, ASBESTOS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  03098  02 OF 08  301021Z </p><p>MATERIALS UNDER THE AMPHIBOLE GROUP, VARIOUS ENCRYPTION </p><p>DEVICES, AND ENCRYPTION SOFTWARE. </p><p> </p><p>QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS AND NON-AUTOMATIC LICENSING: </p><p>VIETNAM HAS BEEN PHASING OUT THE USE OF QUANTITATIVE </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORTS.

THE BTA OBLIGATES VIETNAM TO PHASE </p><p>OUT SEVERAL TRIMS-INCONSISTENT LOCAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  03098  07 OF 08  301023Z </p><p>WITHIN FIVE YEARS OR LESS OF THE BTA\'S ENTRY-INTO-FORCE. </p><p>VIETNAM IS ALSO OBLIGATED TO REFRAIN FROM IMPOSING </p><p>REQUIREMENTS TO TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY AS A CONDITION FOR THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT, EXPANSION, ACQUISITION, MANAGEMENT, CONDUCT, </p><p>OR OPERATION OF AN INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES </p><p> </p><p>VIETNAM MAINTAINS A POLICY OF BIAS IN FAVOR OF DOMESTIC- </p><p>MARKET ORIENTED INDUSTRIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE DOMINATED BY </p><p>STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES.  ALTHOUGH LEGALLY ALL REGISTERED </p><p>FIRMS, REGARDLESS OF OWNERSHIP, CAN ENGAGE IN FOREIGN TRADE, </p><p>BARRIERS EXIST THAT DISCOURAGE TRADING BY NON-STATE </p><p>ENTERPRISES.  FOR EXAMPLE, STRINGENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS </p><p>DEMANDED BY MINISTRIES PREVENT PRIVATE FIRMS FROM EXPORTING </p><p>RICE OR IMPORTING FERTILIZER.  ALSO, MONOPOLIES IN </p><p>PRODUCTION RESULT IN MONOPOLIES IN TRADING, AS IN THE CASE </p><p>OF COAL.  THE TARIFF STRUCTURE ALSO FAVORS DOMESTIC </p><p>INDUSTRIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE DOMINATED BY STATE-OWNED </p><p>ENTERPRISES.  MOST LOWER TARIFFS ARE ON ITEMS PREDOMINANTLY </p><p>USED BY THOSE ENTERPRISES AS INPUTS. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE </p><p> </p><p>TO DATE, E-COMMERCE HAS NOT MADE MUCH PROGRESS IN VIETNAM. </p><p>OBSTACLES TO ITS DEVELOPMENT INCLUDE: THE LOW NUMBER OF </p><p>INTERNET SUBSCRIBERS IN-COUNTRY, OBTRUSIVE FIREWALLS, </p><p>LIMITED BANDWIDTH AND OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE INTERNET </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE, LIMITATIONS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM </p><p>(INCLUDING THE LOW NUMBER OF CREDIT CARDS IN USE), AND </p><p>REGULATORY BARRIERS.

THE NUMBER OF </p><p>ONLINE TRANSACTIONS HAS BEEN INCREASING. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM CONTINUES TO ATTEMPT TO KEEP CLOSE </p><p>CONTROL ON ALL WEBSITES ESTABLISHED IN VIETNAM.  IN OCTOBER </p><p>2002, THE GVN PASSED A NEW REGULATION ON THE ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>AND MODIFICATION OF WEBSITES.  THE REGULATION REQUIRES </p><p>DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN AGENCIES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND </p><p>ENTERPRISES TO OBTAIN A LICENSE FROM THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE </p><p>AND INFORMATION BEFORE ESTABLISHING NEW WEBSITES.  THE </p><p>MINISTRY THEN HAS 30 DAYS TO MAKE A DECISION ON GRANTING THE </p><p>LICENSE.  THE REGULATION ALSO REQUIRES DIPLOMATIC AND OTHER </p><p>FOREIGN ENTITIES TO OBTAIN WRITTEN APPROVAL FROM THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MFA) BEFORE REQUESTING A </p><p>LICENSE FROM MOCI.  THE GVN MAY ALSO REQUIRE ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>TO REQUEST PERMISSION FROM MOCI BEFORE MAKING CHANGES TO THE </p><p>CONTENT OF THEIR EXISTING WEBSITES BASED ON LICENSING </p><p>REQUIREMENTS IN THE REGULATION. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER BARRIERS </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3684 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  03098  08 OF 08  301023Z </p><p>ACTION CIP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EB-00    E-00     UTED-00  FCC-01   TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     MOFM-05  MOF-01   NSAE-00  OES-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------1E0132  301023Z /38 </p><p>O 300934Z DEC 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8496 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 08 OF 08 HANOI 003098 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/GLORIA BLUE </p><p>STATE FOR EB/MTA/MST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CORRUPTION </p><p> </p><p>US, OTHER FOREIGN, AND DOMESTIC FIRMS HAVE IDENTIFIED </p><p>CORRUPTION IN VIETNAM IN ALL PHASES OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS </p><p>AS AN OBSTACLE TO THEIR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.
