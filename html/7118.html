As such a permit would require </p><p>parliamentary approval, however, the Turks were forced to </p><p>deny the request, "Hurriyet" reports.  Worried that </p><p>humanitarian aid could go to terrorist organizations in the </p><p>region, Ankara has insisted on maintaining tight control </p><p>over such supplies.  "Yeni Safak" strongly criticizes the </p><p>transfer of Hummer jeeps to Northern Iraq, saying that </p><p>sophisticated missile systems might be mounted on them. </p><p>"Radikal" reports on a disagreement between Americans and </p><p>Turks on the location of the coordination center for </p><p>representatives of the U.S., Turkey, KDP, PUK, and Turkomen </p><p>representatives.  The Americans say that security </p><p>considerations require the center to be in Diyarbakir or </p><p>Silopi, while Turks believe it should be set up in Northern </p><p>Iraq to enable monitoring of developments in the region. </p><p>The information received by the center regarding PKK/KADEK </p><p>and Al-Ansar organizations and mass movement of displaced </p><p>persons will determine the scope of a Turkish military </p><p>presence in Northern Iraq.  Special Iraq Envoy Khalilzad is </p><p>expected in Ankara on Tuesday to finalize discussions, </p><p>according to reports.  "Aksam" claims that during his </p><p>meetings in Ankara, Secretary Powell agreed to give the </p><p>Turks written guarantees on regional issues of concern such </p><p>as Mosul and Kirkuk, security of the Turkomen, and the </p><p>terrorist threat.  Turkey is reconsidering a U.S. demand for </p><p>expelling Iraqi diplomats allegedly linked to terror groups. </p><p>Thus far, Ankara had turned down the U.S. demand. </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" reports that during his meeting with Secretary </p><p>Powell, TGS Chief General Ozkok warned of Turkish military </p><p>action if American promises on Northern Iraq\'s stability are </p><p>not kept.  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Gul elaborated on his </p><p>remark that Turkey is part of the coalition against Iraq by </p><p>saying that Turkey is not a combatant country, but still a </p><p>member of the U.S.-led coalition.  Parliamentary Speaker </p><p>Arinc strongly criticized the U.S. and UK for acting </p><p>insensitively not only regarding cultural heritage and </p><p>monuments, but also with respect to human life.  Dailies </p><p>report that the Iranian and Syrian foreign ministers will </p><p>visit Ankara next week for meetings about Kurdish activities </p><p>in Northern Iraq.  The visit is taking place amidst </p><p>speculation that Iran and Syria, alleged developers of WMD, </p><p>could be the next targets of the United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Positive Images of Coalition Forces:  For the first time </p><p>since the opening of hostilities, there have been photos in </p><p>Turkish newspapers and film clips on Turkish television </p><p>showing positive interaction between coalition forces and </p><p>Iraqis.  Today\'s "Aksam" carries an article/photo of Iraqis </p><p>and UK troops playing soccer.  (The Iraqis won the match.) </p><p>In today\'s "Sabah," there is a photo of a British soldier </p><p>playing pattycake with a little Iraqi girl, with a caption </p><p>explaining how UK forces are trying to reach out to </p><p>children.  "Vatan" had a full page of photos including U.S. </p><p>troops giving medical aid to an Iraqi civilian, and British </p><p>and UK troops playing with Iraqi children.  The soccer game </p><p>and video of U.S. soldiers singing for Iraqi kids while </p><p>standing on their vehicle have been replayed on NTV, </p><p>national network TRT, and CNN-Turk.  It is a beginning. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Post war scenarios / Powell visit </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US is in need of allies" </p><p>Ferai Tinc commented in mass appeal Hurriyet (4/4): </p><p>"Secretary Powell\'s next stop after Ankara was Belgrade, </p><p>where he found a city of never-ending crime and corruption. </p><p>He was in a country, Yugoslavia, where a lasting peace has </p><p>yet to be established.  Belgrade represents a striking </p><p>example of why we cannot talk about peace and democracy in </p><p>the post-Saddam era in Iraq.  . The US does not appear </p><p>willing to leave Iraq to anyone in the post-Saddam period. </p><p>It is interesting to observe that the US has left all Iraqi </p><p>opposition elements out of the game, with the exception of </p><p>the Kurds.  Things in Iraq are getting messy, and the visit </p><p>by Secretary Powell to Ankara shows that the US feels the </p><p>need for allies at this stage." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"After Powell" </p><p>Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in the conservative/mass appeal Turkiye </p><p>(4/4): "US-Turkish relations were nearing an irrational </p><p>stage, and Turkish foreign policy was headed for a serious </p><p>crash.  Meanwhile, that kind of atmosphere has become a very </p><p>good opportunity for anti-Turkey groups to intensify their </p><p>efforts.  The sudden visit of Secretary Powell is an attempt </p><p>to heal bilateral relations.  We should thank Foreign </p><p>Minister Gul for doing the right thing by declaring that </p><p>Turkey is `in the coalition\' even before Russia and France. </p><p>. Secretary Powell\'s visit helped a great deal to prevent </p><p>Turkey from becoming isolated or alienated.  It was also </p><p>very important to note US remarks about not allowing an </p><p>economic crisis in Turkey." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
