(C) ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS ARE NOT BEING </p><p>DISCUSSED DURING THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN; PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE HAS DONE A BRILLIANT JOB MAKING LAND </p><p>REDISTRIBUTION THE PRINCIPAL AGENDA ITEM FOR DEBATE.  WE </p><p>SEE THREE POSSIBLE ELECTION SCENARIOS UNFOLDING IN THE </p><p>NEXT MONTH: 1. A MORE OR LESS EVEN SPLIT BETWEEN THE </p><p>RULING PARTY AND THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CHANGE (MDC); 2. AN OUTRIGHT MDC VICTORY; OR 3. AN </p><p>OVERWHELMING ZANU-PF VICTORY.  AT THIS WRITING THE LAST </p><p>OUTCOME IS THE MOST PROBABLE, AND SHOULD IT COME TO PASS </p><p>IT SEEMS CLEAR TO US THAT ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS </p><p>WILL ONLY WORSEN, BECAUSE PROPONENTS OF RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES WILL BE MARGINALIZED.  WE </p><p>THINK PRESIDENT MUGABE MAY RUN FOR OFFICE AGAIN IN 2002 </p><p>ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS HANDLING OF THE LAND ISSUE AND </p><p>CLAIM OF UNIQUE ABILITY TO STEER THE COUNTRY THROUGH ITS </p><p>MOUNTING DIFFICULTIES.  HE WILL NOT, HOWEVER, ADDRESS </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC MALAISE SINCERELY, BUT RATHER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02810  01 OF 03  241446Z </p><p>WILL SHIFT THE BLAME FOR IT ON OTHERS.  MEANWHILE, WE ARE </p><p>PICKING UP SIGNALS THAT POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED VIOLENCE </p><p>MAY TAPER OFF IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE SUCCEEDED BRILLIANTLY IN </p><p>SHIFTING THE FOCUS OF THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN DEBATE AWAY </p><p>FROM WHAT REALLY AILS THIS COUNTRY -- THE FAILING OF </p><p>LEADERSHIP AND THE ECONOMIC MORASS -- TO THE LAND ISSUE. </p><p>IF ALLOWED TO PROCEED UNCHECKED IN HIS HOMEGROWN LAND </p><p>REFORM PROGRAM, HE WILL INFLICT DAMAGE THAT WILL BE VERY </p><p>DIFFICULT TO REVERSE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>THREE OUTCOME SCENARIOS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THREE SCENARIOS PRESENT THEMSELVES FOR THE JUNE </p><p>24-25 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, WHICH, THANKS TO THE </p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS, THE PRESIDENT FELT </p><p>SUFFICIENTLY CONFIDENT TO CALL.  THE FIRST SEES A MORE </p><p>OR LESS EVEN SPLIT OF THE VOTE, WITH A SMALL WIN FOR ONE </p><p>OF THE PARTIES.  SUCH AN OUTCOME WOULD IMPLY A TWO-YEAR </p><p>DE FACTO TRANSITION PERIOD FOR ZANU-PF, UNTIL THE 2002 </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE RULING PARTY NO LONGER WOULD </p><p>HAVE THE LEGITIMACY SIMPLY TO IGNORE THE MDC, AND THE </p><p>MODERATES AND REFORMERS IN ZANU-PF WOULD GAIN STRENGTH </p><p>FROM THE POLITICAL DYNAMICS OF THE DAY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE SECOND SEES AN OUTRIGHT VICTORY FOR THE MDC, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02810  01 OF 03  241446Z </p><p>AN INCREASINGLY REMOTE POSSIBILITY.  WE CANNOT RULE IT </p><p>OUT BECAUSE OF AT LEAST TWO UNKNOWNS: FIRST, WHETHER </p><p>ZANU-PF\'S INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN HAS BACKFIRED, AND ON </p><p>ELECTION DAY THE PEOPLE WILL BRAVE THREATS OF </p><p>RETRIBUTION AND VOTE FOR THE MDC; AND SECOND, WHETHER </p><p>THE CIVIL SERVANTS, INCREASINGLY TARGETED BY ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>IRE AND WHOSE TASK IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST TO OFFICIATE </p><p>AT THE POLLS, WILL BE REPLACED BY MORE "LOYAL" ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS (AMONG THEM WAR VETS) TO HELP RIG THE POLLS. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT THAT EMERGES IN THAT CASE WILL BE FACED </p><p>WITH CONTINUOUS CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES, OCCASIONALLY </p><p>EVEN PARALYSIS, AS THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION DOES NOT </p><p>ENVISION SUCH AN EVENTUALITY.  IT WILL BE ROUGH, BUT </p><p>WITH HOPE.  AT THIS WRITING THAT OUTCOME IS IMPROBABLE. </p><p>WE DO NOT RULE OUT A SUBSET OF THIS SCENARIO IN WHICH </p><p>THE MDC IS ALLOWED TO HAVE AS MANY AS 30 SEATS, </p><p>REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME AT THE BALLOT BOX, AND BE </p><p>SATISFIED WITH THE OUTCOME. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE THIRD SCENARIO SEES AN OUT-AND-OUT ZANU-PF </p><p>MAJORITY (THIS ALLOWS FEWER THAN 30 SEATS FOR MDC).  AT </p><p>THIS TIME, THIS SEEMS LIKE THE MOST PROBABLE ELECTORAL </p><p>OUTCOME, ACHIEVED THROUGH INTIMIDATION, RIGGING, AND </p><p>NEUTRALIZING THE OPPOSITION\'S ABILITY TO MOUNT ANY </p><p>RESISTANCE.  CONCERN FOR THE ECONOMY IN THAT CASE WILL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2087 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02810  02 OF 03  241447Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      INL-01   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-01   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /012W </p><p>                  ------------------5AE57A  241447Z /38 </p><p>P 241448Z MAY 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6139 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 002810 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID RMCCALL AND AFR/SA WJEFFERS </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND GRACE SONE </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037/ERIC HENDERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02810  02 OF 03  241447Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/24/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: THE MORNING AFTER: ZIMBABWE\'S POST-ELECTION </p><p>ECONOMIC HANGOVER </p><p> </p><p>BE THE PREOCCUPATION OF A FEW, PROBABLY CIVIL SERVANTS, </p><p>WHO WORRY ABOUT THE COUNTRY\'S CREDIBILITY ON THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SCENE.  THESE INDIVIDUALS LIKELY WILL BE </p><p>MARGINALIZED OR SILENCED.  THE TRIUMPHANT ZANU-PF </p><p>LEADERSHIP WILL CONTINUE ITS ECONOMIC ISOLATION WITH </p><p>PRIDE, AND WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO RESTORE RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR THE DONORS. </p><p>MANY THINK, LIKE COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY MINISTER NATHAN </p><p>SHAMUYARIRA, THAT THE COUNTRY WAS BADLY ADVISED BY THE </p><p>WEST TO ADOPT A STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM IN 1991, </p><p>AND THAT MUGABE COULD RETURN TO THE STATIST, AUTARCHIC </p><p>AND MARXIST ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE 1980\'S. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>RIGHTING THE SHIP OF STATE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) NO COUNTRY APPEARS ABLE TO SURVIVE ANY MORE WITH </p><p>SUCH POLICIES IN PLACE (THE EXAMPLES OF NORTH KOREA, </p><p>CUBA AND IRAQ SPRING TO MIND), AND NOT ONLY ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>PEOPLE BUT THE SUB-REGION AS A WHOLE WILL FEEL THE </p><p>IMPACT OF DECLINING ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE.  THE PROBLEMS </p><p>CURRENTLY FACED OF AN OVERVALUED BUT FUNDAMENTALLY WEAK </p><p>CURRENCY, NO FOREIGN EXCHANGE, GALLOPING INFLATION, </p><p>BALLOONING PUBLIC DEBT AND SHRINKING OUTBOUND TRADE WILL </p><p>ONLY GET WORSE.

(C) IN OUR JUDGMENT, FOR ZIMBABWE TO GET BACK ON THE </p><p>ECONOMIC TRACK THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO: </p><p> </p><p>-- SLASH SPENDING TO REIN IN THE DEFICIT (FISCAL </p><p>POLICY); </p><p> </p><p>-- ADHERE TO A STRICT MONETARY POLICY; </p><p> </p><p>-- SUPPORT, AND NOT ATTACK, THE PRIVATE SECTOR; </p><p> </p><p>-- PRIVATIZE THE PARASTATALS, VIRTUALLY ALL OF WHICH ARE </p><p>LOSS MAKERS; </p><p> </p><p>-- INITIATE A SERIOUS ANTI-CORRUPTION DRIVE WITH </p><p>CREDIBLE FOLLOW-THROUGH; </p><p> </p><p>-- PARTICIPATE IN SADC IN A SERIOUS MANNER (THE ATTITUDE </p><p>NOW IS STRICTLY WHAT\'S IN IT FOR ZIMBABWE AND USING IT </p><p>AS A POLITICAL FORUM); </p><p> </p><p>-- CARRY OUT LAND REFORM IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- RESTORE THE CITIZENRY\'S FAITH IN RULE OF LAW AND </p><p>RESPECT FOR FREE MARKET PRINCIPLES. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02810  02 OF 03  241447Z </p><p>8.  (C) FOR THE TIME BEING WE HAVE SEEN LITTLE </p><p>INDICATION THAT ANYONE IN THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IS </p><p>GIVING ANY OF THESE MEASURES SERIOUS THOUGHT, NEVER MIND </p><p>TAKING ANY STEPS IN SUCH A DIRECTION.  ONE SENIOR </p><p>MINISTRY OF FINANCE OFFICIAL, TRYING TO PUT THE BEST </p><p>FACE ON THINGS, TOLD US ON MAY 23 THAT HIS MINISTRY\'S </p><p>PATRIOTIC CIVIL SERVANTS HAD INSTITUTED A PRE-PAID </p><p>SYSTEM OF COUPONS TO BAR OTHER GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS </p><p>FROM GETTING FREE FUEL AT THE GOVERNMENT\'S DEPOTS.  NO </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WILL BE PINNED DOWN ON WHAT THE </p><p>POST-ELECTION ECONOMIC POLICY MIGHT BE BEYOND REFERRING </p><p>TO THE MILLENNIUM ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM (MERP), A </p><p>COMPILATION OF ECONOMIC GOALS LONG ON DESIDERATA AND </p><p>SHORT ON SPECIFICS OF HOW TO REACH THEM.  THE ZANU-PF </p><p>ELECTORAL PARTY PLANK, IN ANY CASE, MIGHTILY CONTRADICTS </p><p>THE MERP\'S PRECEPTS AND GOALS.  CIVIL SERVANTS WHO WILL </p><p>BE BRUTALLY FRANK WITH US SAY THAT THEY HOPE THE WORLD </p><p>WILL FORGET THE BEHAVIOR AND EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE </p><p>ELECTION AND LEND ZIMBABWE A HELPING HAND.  "WE WILL </p><p>NEED A FEW FRIENDS," OUR FINANCE MINISTRY INTERLOCUTOR </p><p>TOLD US, "TO HELP US OUT OF THE PIT WE HAVE DUG </p><p>OURSELVES." </p><p> </p><p>9.
