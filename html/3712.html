<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 005238 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NEA FOR LAROCCO, NEA/PPD FOR MACINNES, BOURGEOIS, EUR/ERA </p><p>FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PREL, OPRC </p><p>SUBJECT: DRAWING A ROADMAP FOR IRAQ PUBLIC DIPLOMACY: </p><p>JORDANIAN PERSPECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 169975 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 05196 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 05168 </p><p>     D. AMMAN 05131 </p><p>     E. AMMAN 05173 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: HMAHONEY, PAO, FOR REASON 1.5B </p><p> </p><p>(C) SUMMARY. THE PUBLIC DIPLOMACY ENVIRONMENT IN JORDAN </p><p>REGARDING U.S. POLICY TOWARDS IRAQ IS FRAUGHT WITH SUSPICION </p><p>AND ANGER ABOUT PERCEIVED U.S. AMBITIONS TOWARDS THE REGION. </p><p>JORDANIANS WIDELY BELIEVE THAT U.S. POLICY IN THE REGION IS A </p><p>PRODUCT OF ITS STRONGLY PRO-ISRAELI STANCE WITHOUT REGARD FOR </p><p>ARAB INTERESTS.  JORDANIANS ARE ALSO DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT THE </p><p>IMPACT OF U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ (WHICH MOST THINK IS </p><p>ALMOST INEVITABLE) ON JORDAN\'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>WELL-BEING.  JORDAN\'S ECONOMIC TIES TO IRAQ ARE CLOSER THAN </p><p>THOSE OF ANY OTHER ARAB COUNTRY.  LINKAGES OF KINSHIP, </p><p>EDUCATION AND CULTURE ARE ALSO STRONG, AND SECOND ONLY TO </p><p>THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PALESTINIANS IN THEIR EMOTIONAL </p><p>INTENSITY.  WE CAN EXPECT THE GOJ TO ATTEMPT TO DAMPEN </p><p>POPULAR EMOTIONS, BUT OFFICIAL PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON U.S. </p><p>ACTIONS WILL BE CAREFULLY CALIBRATED TO AVOID PROVOKING OR </p><p>WORSENING POPULAR EXPRESSIONS OF ANGER AGAINST BOTH THE U.S. </p><p>AND THE GOVERNMENT. SHOULD U.S. MILITARY ACTION OCCUR, THE </p><p>EMOTIONAL REACTION WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO GET OUR MESSAGE </p><p>HEARD, ESPECIALLY IN THE INITIAL STAGES OF ENGAGEMENT. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, WE MUST MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO STATE OUR PUBLIC </p><p>DIPLOMACY MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR AND PURSUE A LONG-RANGE </p><p>STRATEGY OF EXCHANGES AND DIALOGUE IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE </p><p>DAMAGE TO OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WITH JORDAN.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE CLIMATE: A WITCHES\' BREW </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) SEVERAL EMOTIONAL AND WIDELY HELD VIEWS OF U.S. </p><p>MOTIVATIONS TOWARDS THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC WORLD COMBINE TO </p><p>PRODUCE A STRONG REACTION AGAINST OUR EFFORTS TO CHANGE THE </p><p>IRAQI REGIME AND ELIMINATE IRAQ\'S POTENTIAL TO THREATEN US </p><p>WITH WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. IN FACT, JORDANIANS ARE </p><p>LARGELY UNCONCERNED ABOUT SADDAM\'S ACQUISITION OF WMD.  EVEN </p><p>IF HE GETS THEM, THEY ARGUE, SO WHAT?  OTHER EQUALLY </p><p>DANGEROUS COUNTRIES HAVE WMD OR THE CAPACITY TO BUILD THEM, </p><p>MOST NOTABLY ISRAEL, BUT ALSO SYRIA, AND NORTH KOREA. </p><p>JORDANIANS BEGIN FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT U.S. PLANS TO </p><p>INVADE IRAQ ARE MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO PROTECT ISRAEL, </p><p>DOMINATE THE OIL-RICH REGION AND ACT OUT  FEAR AND THIRST FOR </p><p>REVENGE AFTER SEPT. 11.  WHATEVER EFFORTS SADDAM MAY HAVE </p><p>MADE TO ACQUIRE WMD, JORDANIANS DOUBT THAT IRAQ POSES ANY </p><p>REAL DANGER TO THE UNITED STATES, AND BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>DETERRENCE ARGUMENT IS A PRETEXT. THE LOCAL MEDIA ROUTINELY </p><p>PORTRAY THE U.S. ACTIONS AFTER SEPT. 11 AS AN EFFORT TO </p><p>EXPLOIT A GENUINE HUMAN TRAGEDY AS A PRETEXT TO GO AFTER </p><p>ARABS AND MUSLIMS WHO STAND IN OUR WAY. JORDANIAN </p><p>COMMENTATORS ON THE U.S. DOMESTIC SCENE WARN OF GROWING </p><p>HOSTILITY AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ISLAM AND ARABS IN U.S. </p><p>SOCIETY: A BETRAYAL OF AMERICAN IDEALS OF FREEDOM AND </p><p>EQUALITY. </p><p> </p><p>(C) UNDERLYING THE HOSTILITY AND SUSPICION IS THE CONVICTION, </p><p>FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED IN THE PRESS, THAT THE U.S. VIEWS THE </p><p>REGION AND THE WAR ON TERRORISM THROUGH THE ISRAELI PRISM, </p><p>AND IS INCAPABLE OR UNWILLING TO SYSTEMATICALLY FACTOR IN </p><p>ARAB INTERESTS.  MANY CONTACTS TELL US THAT THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>ISSUE IS BIGGER THAN IRAQ IN THE JORDANIAN MIND, AND THAT THE </p><p>PERCEPTION OF U.S. BIAS TOWARDS ISRAEL DETERMINES POPULAR </p><p>ATTITUDES TOWARDS AMERICAN ACTIONS VIS A VIS IRAQ. ANY </p><p>ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN AN ATTACK ON IRAQ WOULD SOLIDIFY THE </p><p>BELIEF THAT AMERICAN AND ISRAELI GOALS ARE IDENTICAL. DRAWING </p><p>ON STATEMENTS BY ISRAELI JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS, SOME </p><p>JORDANIANS FEAR THAT THE SHARON GOVERNMENT WILL USE THE COVER </p><p>OF U.S. MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ TO CRUSH THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>AUTHORITY AND EXPEL LARGE NUMBERS OF PALESTINIANS INTO </p><p>JORDAN.   A PALESTINIAN INFLUX COMBINED WITH A SIMILAR </p><p>MOVEMENT OF REFUGEES FROM IRAQ, THEY FEAR, WOULD LEAD TO </p><p>WIDESPREAD ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TURMOIL. ADD TO THIS THE </p><p>CUT-OFF OF CHEAP IRAQI OIL AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE IRAQI </p><p>IMPORT MARKET AND THE NEAR-TERM PICTURE LOOKS BLEAK FOR THE </p><p>ORDINARY JORDANIAN CITIZEN. </p><p> </p><p>(C) WE CAN EXPECT THE GOJ TO PURSUE A CAREFULLY CRAFTED </p><p>PUBLIC LINE DESIGNED TO DEFLECT POPULAR DISSATISFACTION WITH </p><p>GOJ POLICY.  THERE WILL PROBABLY BE MORE OFFICIAL STATEMENTS </p><p>AND EDITORIALS ADVISING JORDANIANS TO CONSIDER THEIR OWN </p><p>NATIONAL INTERESTS AHEAD OF THE IRAQI OR PALESTINIAN ISSUES </p><p>AND ALLUDING TO THE BENEFITS OF THE U.S.-JORDANIAN OFFICIAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP.  BUT GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR DOMINATED MEDIA WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY EMOTIONAL STATEMENTS AGAINST </p><p>U.S. POLICY.  LIKE OTHER ARAB GOVERNMENTS, THE GOJ HAS BEGUN </p><p>TO PUT SOME EFFORT INTO TEMPERING THESE INFLAMMATORY </p><p>ARGUMENTS (SEE REFS B-D) BUT ITS PUBLIC SUPPORT WILL </p><p>NECESSARILY BE LIMITED LEST IT BE PERCEIVED AS AN AMERICAN </p><p>CLIENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PUBLIC AFFAIRS APPROACH: </p><p> </p><p>(U) OUR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY APPROACH SHOULD BE THREE-FOLD: A) </p><p>PRESENT LOUD AND CLEAR MESSAGES ON U.S. POLICY AND SWIFTLY </p><p>COUNTER DISINFORMATION; B) BE GOOD LISTENERS AND SUSTAIN THE </p><p>DIALOGUE C) AFTER THE DUST SETTLES, CONTINUE AND EXPAND THE </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL TIES, ESPECIALLY WITH YOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>(U) A.  MESSAGES TO BE DELIVERED BY SPOKESPERSONS AT THE </p><p>HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE WHITE HOUSE, STATE DEPARTMENT, DOD, NSC </p><p>AND RELATED AGENCIES: </p><p> </p><p>C)--OUR GOAL IS TO RE-INTEGRATE IRAQ INTO THE GLOBAL </p><p>COMMUNITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS PEOPLE.  THIS WOULD END </p><p>SANCTIONS AND ISOLATION AND REVIVE IRAQ\'S GREAT POTENTIAL AS </p><p>A FULL PARTNER IN THE REGION.  WHILE WE ARE COMMITTED TO </p><p>IRAQ\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, RELATIVE PROSPERITY AND </p><p>STABILITY IN THE FREE KURDISH AREAS SHOW WHAT COULD BE DONE </p><p>IF THE WHOLE COUNTRY WERE FREE OF SADDAM\'S GRIP. (NOTE: </p><p>ENDING THE SANCTIONS IS THE ONLY SILVER LINING WHICH </p><p>JORDANIAN COMMENTATORS HAVE SEEN IN A U.S. MILITARY STRIKE </p><p>WHICH TOPPLES SADDAM.  EVIDENCE THAT IRAQIS WELCOME SADDAM\'S </p><p>DOWNFALL IF OR WHEN IT HAPPENS WOULD ALSO HAVE A POSITIVE </p><p>IMPACT.) </p><p> </p><p>(U)--THE U.S. WILL NOT RELENT IN ITS EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT AND TO PURSUE A LASTING AND JUST </p><p>TWO-STATE SOLUTION BASED ON UNSCR\'S 242, 338, 1397, THE </p><p>CONCEPT OF LAND-FOR-PEACE.  NOR WILL WE ALLOW ANY PARTY TO </p><p>EXPLOIT THE IRAQ SITUATION TO CHANGE FACTS ON THE GROUND. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S. FIRMLY REJECTS EXPULSION OF POPULATIONS </p><p>AND WILL NOT ACCEPT IT. ISRAEL IS NOT PART OF OUR MILITARY </p><p>COALITION AGAINST SADDAM.  (USG SPOKESPERSONS WILL NEED TO </p><p>IMMEDIATELY COUNTER ANY STATEMENTS TO THE CONTRARY, E.G. FROM </p><p>THE ISRAELI MEDIA.) </p><p> </p><p>(U)--THOUGH WE MAY DISAGREE ABOUT STRATEGY, THE WORLD </p><p>COMMUNITY SUPPORTS OUR PREMISE THAT WMD IN SADDAM\'S HANDS </p><p>POSE A GRAVE THREAT NOT ONLY TO THE U.S. BUT TO THE REGION, </p><p>AND  MUST BE REMOVED WITHOUT DELAY.  THE U.S. IS NOT ACTING </p><p>UNILATERALLY. (HERE WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE SUPPORTIVE STATEMENTS </p><p>FROM THE U.N.,OTHER UNSC MEMBERS, STRATEGIC STUDIES CENTERS, </p><p>THINK TANKS ETC.  RELEASE OF DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER "PROOF" </p><p>OF IRAQ\'S CONTINUING WMD PROGRAMS WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL.) </p><p> </p><p>(U)--ANY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ IS AIMED AT SADDAM HUSSEIN, NOT </p><p>PART OF A DOMINO-STRATEGY TO REMOVE OTHER UNFRIENDLY REGIMES, </p><p>E.G. SYRIA AND IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>(U)--SEPT. 11 HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE AMERICAN PSYCHE, </p><p>BUT DID NOT CREATE A CLIMATE OF HATRED AND INTOLERANCE </p><p>TOWARDS ARABS OR ISLAM.  IN FACT, AMERICAN INTEREST IN ISLAM </p><p>AND DESIRE FOR DIALOGUE INCREASED RADICALLY, PROVIDING AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING.  AMERICANS ARE </p><p>COMMITTED TO EXPANDING THAT DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>(U)--THE U.S. AND OUR ALLIES WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO </p><p>PREVENT ECONOMIC DISLOCATION TO OUR FRIENDS IN THE REGION. </p><p>THROUGH OUR TRADE AND AID APPROACHES WE HAVE A STRONG </p><p>PARTNERSHIP TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE ARAB WORLD </p><p>WHICH HAS REAPED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS AND IS ONE OF THE MAIN </p><p>HOPES FOR THE FUTURE GENERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>B.  SUSTAINING THE DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p>(U) IT WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR AMERICA TO BE PERCEIVED AS </p><p>LISTENING TO OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION AND SERIOUSLY </p><p>CONSIDERING THEIR VIEWS AND INTERESTS EVEN WHEN THE RHETORIC </p><p>AND POPULAR EMOTIONS ESCALATE.  EMBASSY OFFICERS AND OTHER </p><p>USG OFFICIALS VISITING THE REGION SHOULD ENGAGE IN PUBLIC </p><p>DIALOGUE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, BOTH THROUGH THE MEDIA AND WITH </p><p>UNIVERSITIES, NGO\'S AND OTHER PUBLIC FORA. WE ESPECIALLY NEED </p><p>ARABIC-SPEAKING SPOKESPERSONS AND OBJECTIVE COMMENTATORS TO </p><p>APPEAR ON SATELLITE TV TALK-SHOWS TO COUNTER THE EXTREME </p><p>MISCHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE U.S.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY </p><p>NECESSARY TO COUNTER THE WIDESPREAD IMPRESSION THAT </p><p>ARAB-AMERICANS AND MUSLIM AMERICANS LIVE IN FEAR OF REPRISAL </p><p>OR OFFICIAL HARASSMENT IN THE U.S.  MANY JORDANIANS WHO </p><p>STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH OUR POLICIES NEVERTHELESS PIN THEIR </p><p>LONG-RANGE HOPES ON POSITIVE RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.  BUT </p><p>THOSE HOPES WILL DIE IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO TALK TO US AND </p><p>VENT THEIR EMOTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>(U)WE WILL ALSO NEED RAPID RESPONSES TO COUNTER </p><p>DISINFORMATION FROM IRAQIS AND OTHERS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE CAN </p><p>EXPECT MASSIVE EXAGGERATIONS OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AND </p><p>DISINFORMATION ABOUT ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT.  WE WILL NEED THE </p><p>FACTS VIA USG OFFICIAL RESPONSES ASAP. THE LONDON INFORMATION </p><p>CENTER IS AN EXCELLENT MEANS OF PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION </p><p>AND SO ARE OUR INFORMATION RESOURCE CENTERS AT THE POSTS. </p><p> </p><p>(U) TO COUNTER THE MISPERCEPTION THAT AMERICANS HATE ISLAM </p><p>AND ARABS, WE WILL NEED ARAB-AMERICAN AND MUSLIM-AMERICAN </p><p>SPEAKERS AND OTHERS WHO CAN FORGE LINKAGES BETWEEN THEIR </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITIES AND JORDANIANS.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>WE ARE SENDING TO THE U.S. A GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL VISITORS </p><p>FROM SHARIA\' SCHOOLS AND OTHER ISLAMIC INSTITUTIONS.  THEY </p><p>WILL MEET WITH U.S. INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE GEORGETOWN </p><p>CENTER FOR MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN UNDERSTANDING.  SEVERAL JORDANIAN </p><p>NGO\'S HAVE EXPRESSED STRONG INTEREST IN SPEAKER EXCHANGE </p><p>PROGRAMS THAT WOULD GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK </p><p>DIRECTLY TO AMERICAN AUDIENCES.  MANY JORDANIANS ARE EAGER TO </p><p>PRESENT THEIR RELIGION AND SOCIETY TO AMERICAN AUDIENCES AND </p><p>WE SHOULD SUPPORT THIS TWO-WAY EXCHANGE WHEREVER POSSIBLE </p><p>BOTH THROUGH USG EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AND FUNDING FOR NGO\'S. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C.  EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER EXCHANGE LINKAGES </p><p> </p><p>(U) OUR EXCHANGE AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WILL NO DOUBT </p><p>SUFFER AT LEAST TEMPORARILY FROM ANY MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ. </p><p> WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN SOME CONTACTS DECLINING SPEAKER AND </p><p>OTHER PROGRAMS AS A RESULT OF THEIR OBJECTIONS TO U.S. POLICY </p><p>TOWARDS THE PALESTINIANS AND IRAQ.  NEVERTHELESS WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER EXCHANGES WILL </p><p>ENDURE AS JORDANIANS REFLECT ON THEIR LONG-RUN INTERESTS.  WE </p><p>SHOULD BE IN A POSITION TO OFFER A SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED </p><p>LEVEL OF EDUCATIONAL AND CITIZEN EXCHANGES, ENGLISH </p><p>INSTRUCTION, AND COOPERATION IN THE FIELDS OF CIVIC EDUCATION </p><p>AND CIVIL SOCIETY AND OTHER AREAS WITH A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON </p><p>REACHING YOUTH. AND WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THE IMPACT OF </p><p>CULTURAL PROGRAMMING IN THE FIELDS OF FILM, DRAMA, MUSIC, </p><p>DANCE LITERATURE AND THE ARTS.  THE LATTER AREA REMAINS </p><p>ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AS THE GOVERNMENT CRACKS DOWN ON </p><p>POLITICAL DISCUSSION LEAVING THE ARTS AS ONE OF THE ONLY </p><p>VEHICLES OF FREE EXPRESSION. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
