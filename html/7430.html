<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000738 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GROWING SADC ENGAGEMENT ON ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: LILONGWE 361 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>SADC presidential mission </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) South African High Commissioner to Zimbabwe, Jeremiah </p><p>Ndou, confirmed to the Ambassador on April 14 that President </p><p>Mbeki is planning a joint visit to Zimbabwe with President </p><p>Muluzi on April 24, as reported reftel.  He expressed concern </p><p>that the Angolans -- who should be taking the lead as SADC </p><p>chairman in the search for a solution to Zimbabwe\'s political </p><p>crisis -- might resent the Muluzi/Mbeki initiative, and </p><p>ensuing bickering within SADC might complicate the proposed </p><p>mission. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ndou offered his view that only a SADC effort at the </p><p>head of state level stood any chance of alleviating the </p><p>Zimbabwean crisis; foreign ministers, he thought, would be </p><p>able to achieve little of substance.  To be successful, he </p><p>continued, any SADC  mission to Zimbabwe ought to present a </p><p>list of specific verifiable demands, most for the Government </p><p>but some for the opposition MDC (including dropping its court </p><p>challenge of the 2002 presidential election).   Ndou believed </p><p>the ideal composition of a SADC mission would be the heads of </p><p>state from the Troika (Angola, Malawi, Tanzania), plus </p><p>Presidents Mbeki and Chissano.  The Ambassador emphasized the </p><p>importance of South African participation, saying it was the </p><p>SADC country with the most leverage, noting recent press </p><p>reports of ESKOM\'s growing impatience with Zimbabwean </p><p>non-payment of its electricity bills. </p><p> </p><p>SADC task force </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The planning for an Mbeki/Muluzi visit is only the </p><p>latest development in recent SADC efforts to address SADC\'s </p><p>problem child.  On April 3, 10 SADC foreign ministers </p><p>gathered in Harare under the rubric of the SADC organ on </p><p>defense, security, and politics.  According to Tanzanian High </p><p>Commissioner Alexander Muganda, the group wanted to focus </p><p>primarily on Zimbabwe but Harare blocked it, devising a </p><p>broader agenda which included a range of SADC-related issues. </p><p> In the end, the SADC foreign ministers did hold a  five-hour </p><p>"off the record" discussion with Zimbabwean Foreign Minister </p><p>Mudenge, which Muganda described as "frank."  Muganda said he </p><p>had not attended that small session but that Mudenge was, in </p><p>the open session meetings, in typical deflective mode in the </p><p>face of a barrage of questions from his colleagues about the </p><p>situation in Zimbabwe, refusing to engage in a genuine </p><p>assessment of events on the ground.  While in Harare, </p><p>Mozambican Foreign Minister Simao was unusually blunt, </p><p>telling assembled journalists that "Zimbabweans are not </p><p>living in peace and harmony...We are concerned and because of </p><p>this, next week a task force should be coming to Zimbabwe to </p><p>deal with the situation...We have an obligation to overcome </p><p>the difficulties Zimbabweans are facing."  Subsequent efforts </p><p>to arrange a SADC task force visit by foreign ministers have </p><p>been hindered by a Zimbabwean government determined to delay </p><p>and control the process to the extent possible, according to </p><p>Muganda. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  South African High Commissioner Ndou did attend </p><p>Mudenge\'s April 3 closed discussion on Zimbabwe with his </p><p>counterparts, and he told us that Mudenge was franker than </p><p>usual in acknowledging problems in that conversation. </p><p>Whenever he strayed from the party line, however, Mudenge </p><p>emphasized that he was expressing his personal views. </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  It is unclear whether the Muluzi/Mbeki initiative </p><p>will displace the effort by SADC foreign ministers or </p><p>complement it.  We strongly agree with Jeremiah Ndou\'s </p><p>assessment, however, that active engagement by SADC heads of </p><p>state stands the best chance of convincing Mugabe to step </p><p>back from the brink.  Mugabe\'s arrogance and substantial ego </p><p>would prevent genuine engagement with foreign ministers, and </p><p>ensure that any visit at that level would produce little more </p><p>than the usual anodyne statement.  He would at least listen </p><p>to fellow heads of state, albeit with a keen awareness of his </p><p>own seniority to all but the Angolan.  We also agree that </p><p>SADC leaders must come prepared to hold Mugabe\'s feet to the </p><p>fire on a specific list of concerns.  Mugabe will take </p><p>advantage of any fuzzy arguments or uncertainties of the </p><p>facts on the ground here to quickly divert the conversation </p><p>to extraneous topics, such as the unfairness of the Lancaster </p><p>House agreement, the centrality of the land issue, or </p><p>Harare\'s relations with London. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
