(U) THE UMBRELLA NGO ZIMBABWE ELECTION SUPPORT NETWORK </p><p>(ZESN), WHICH HAS COORDINATED THE DOMESTIC MONITORING EFFORT </p><p>IN RECENT ELECTIONS, ISSUED A PUBLIC STATEMENT OF CONCERN </p><p>AFTER CHINAMASA\'S ANNOUNCEMENT.

AS THE COMMENTS BY CHINAMASA AND </p><p>MOYO REVEAL, SENIOR GOZ OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT A MAJORITY OF </p><p>LOCAL NGO\'S ARE FRONT ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING THE </p><p>INTERESTS OF WESTERN COUNTRIES, AND ARE WORKING TO ENSURE AN </p><p>MDC VICTORY IN NEXT YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  AS A </p><p>RESULT, THE GOVERNMENT WILL ATTEMPT TO PUT IN PLACE MONITOR </p><p>SYMPATHETIC TO IT.  ANOTHER EQUALLY LIKELY POSSIBILITY, IN </p><p>OUR VIEW, IS THAT THE ESC SIMPLY WILL BE UNABLE TO RECRUIT, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 06        HARARE  03356  141519Z </p><p>TRAIN, AND ACCREDIT SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE, MEANING </p><p>VERY FEW DOMESTIC MONITORS WILL BE IN PLACE ON ELECTION DAY </p><p>THE PROSPECT THAT EITHER SCENARIO WILL COME TO PASS FURTHER </p><p>DAMPENS OUR HOPE THAT NEXT YEAR\'S ELECTION WILL APPROACH FR </p><p>AND FAIR.  THAT SAID, IT APPEARS THAT, ALTHOUGH CIVIL SOCIETY </p><p>GROUPS SUCH AS ZESN WILL BE BARRED FROM ENTERING THE POLLING </p><p>STATIONS ON ELECTION DAYS, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO </p><p>MONITOR PREPARATIONS AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE DURING THE PRE- </p><p>ELECTION PERIOD.  THEIR EXCLUSION FROM THE POLLING STATIONS </p><p>ON ELECTION DAYS WILL MAKE THE ROLE OF THE POLITICAL PARTY </p><p>AGENTS WHO ARE PERMITTED INSIDE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. </p><p> </p><p>6.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT GOVERNMENT IS WORKING TO </p><p>NARROW THE LOOPHOLES FOR EFFECTIVE DOMESTIC MONITORING AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVATION, BUT WE NEED TO KEEP PRESSING EVERY </p><p>OPPORTUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p>@@@OASYS@@@ </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5019 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03356  01 OF 02  141418Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   COR-01   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  A-00     ACQ-00 </p><p>      CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00  WHA-00   DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  UTED-00  FOE-00   VC-00    FSI-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    JUSE-00  L-00     VCE-00   NEA-00 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OIG-03   IRM-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      SA-00    R-00     EPAE-00  IIP-00   SNIS-00  NISC-00  DSCC-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------3E15D6  141418Z /07 </p><p>O 091154Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0251 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY STOCKHOLM </p><p>AMEMBASSY OSLO </p><p>AMEMBASSY COPENHAGEN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 003356 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03356  01 OF 02  141418Z </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y : (TEXT R/H MARGIN) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/31/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE MOVES TO PROHIBIT INDEPENDENT DOMESTIC </p><p>ELECTION MONITORS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 195461 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON. </p><p>REASONS:  1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) MINISTER OF JUSTICE, LEGAL, AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS </p><p>PATRICK CHINAMASA ANNOUNCED ON NOVEMBER 6 THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>INTENTION TO AMEND THE ELECTORAL ACT TO GIVE THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIALLY-APPOINTED ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION </p><p>(ESC) EXPLICIT RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECRUITMENT, TRAINING, AND </p><p>DEPLOYMENT OF ELECTION MONITORS.
