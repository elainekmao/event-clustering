(U) JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA ANNOUNCED ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 2 THE EARLY RETIREMENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY </p><p>GUBBAY.  SHORTLY AFTER MEETING WITH GUBBAY IN HIS SUPREME </p><p>COURT CHAMBERS, CHINAMASA ISSUED A STATEMENT ANNOUNCING </p><p>THAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE WOULD TAKE FOUR MONTHS OF LEAVE </p><p>BEGINNING ON MARCH 1, THEN WOULD RETIRE ON JUNE 30, NINE </p><p>MONTHS BEFORE HE REACHES HIS MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE OF </p><p>70.  THE MEETING WITH CHINAMASA FOLLOWS A JANUARY 22 </p><p>MEETING BETWEEN GUBBAY AND VICE-PRESIDENT MUZENDA (REF B), </p><p>DURING WHICH, ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, GUBBAY THREATENED </p><p>TO RESIGN AFTER MUZENDA DISMISSED HIS REQUEST FOR </p><p>PROTECTION AGAINST INCREASING HARASSMENT BY SO-CALLED WAR </p><p>VETERANS.  CHINAMASA SUBSEQUENTLY INFORMED GUBBAY, IN THE </p><p>FEBRUARY 2 MEETING, THAT HE HAD BEEN SENT TO ACCEPT </p><p>GUBBAY\'S RESIGNATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WE WERE SURPRISED BY THE ABRUPTNESS OF GUBBAY\'S </p><p>DEPARTURE, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE CHIEF JUSTICE\'S </p><p>ASSURANCES TO US ON JANUARY 26 (REF B) THAT HE INTENDED TO </p><p>REMAIN ON THE COURT UNTIL AT LEAST THE END OF THE YEAR. </p><p>THE CHARGE PHONED GUBBAY ON FEBRUARY 5 TO SOLICIT HIS </p><p>ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED IN THE CHINAMASA MEETING. </p><p>WITHOUT ELABORATING, GUBBAY TOLD THE CHARGE THAT HE IS NOT </p><p>LEAVING OF HIS OWN FREE WILL.  (NOTE: ONE INFORMED SOURCE </p><p>TOLD US THAT UPON READING THE TRANSCRIPT OF MUZENDA\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00644  01 OF 02  051552Z </p><p>MEETING, MUGABE REPORTEDLY SAID "TELL HIM WE ACCEPT HIS </p><p>RESIGNATION."  END NOTE.)  THE CHIEF JUSTICE CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>HE WILL TAKE FOUR MONTHS OF ACCUMULATED LEAVE BEGINNING ON </p><p>MARCH 1 AND WILL RETIRE ON JUNE 30.  PRESIDENT MUGABE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO GUBBAY, PLANS TO APPOINT JUDGE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE HIGH COURT GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU AS ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>DURING THE FOUR-MONTH LEAVE AND, PRESUMABLY, AS HIS FORMAL </p><p>SUCCESSOR UPON GUBBAY\'S OFFICIAL RETIREMENT.  GUBBAY SAID </p><p>HE GREATLY APPRECIATED THE LARGE NUMBER OF MESSAGES OF </p><p>SUPPORT HE HAD RECEIVED DURING THE WEEKEND. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION WITH CHARGE DURING THE </p><p>FEBRUARY 3-4 WEEKEND, TOM WALTER, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF </p><p>MOBIL OIL ZIMBABWE AND AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, EXPRESSED ALARM </p><p>AT THE LIKELY DETRIMENTAL IMPACT OF GUBBAY\'S EARLY </p><p>RETIREMENT ON BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, ALREADY AT AN ALL-TIME </p><p>LOW.   THE CHIEF JUSTICE\'S DEPARTURE PROMPTED WALTER TO </p><p>WRITE A LETTER TO HIS HEADQUARTERS RECOMMENDING A </p><p>REASSESSMENT OF MOBIL\'S PRESENCE IN ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CHINAMASA\'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF GUBBAY\'S EARLY </p><p>RETIREMENT FOLLOWED MONTHS OF GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED </p><p>HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION (REFTELS) OF THE WELL-RESPECTED </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE AND -- TO A LESSER DEGREE -- HIS COLLEAGUES </p><p>ON THE COUNTRY\'S HIGHEST BENCH.  INDEED, GUBBAY\'S DEPARTURE </p><p>CONCLUDED A WEEK-AND-A-HALF OF ESCALATING INTIMIDATION OF </p><p>THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA, THE JUDICIARY, TOWN COUNCILS AROUND </p><p>THE COUNTRY, AND MANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00644  01 OF 02  051552Z </p><p>WHICH HAVE EXPRESSED -- OR ARE SUSPECTED OF HARBORING -- </p><p>VIEWS CONTRARY TO THOSE ESPOUSED BY THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>GUBBAY\'S COMMENT TO US THAT HE IS NOT LEAVING OF HIS OWN </p><p>FREE WILL CONFIRMED OUR SUSPICION THAT HIS DEPARTURE IS </p><p>UNDER DURESS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF THE EXPECTED PROMOTION OF </p><p>THE UNABASHEDLY PRO-ZANU-PF GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU IS UNCLEAR, </p><p>AS THE CHIEF JUSTICE IS, IN PRACTICE, FIRST AMONG EQUALS </p><p>AND WILL BE UNABLE TO RUN ROUGHSHOD OVER HIS FOUR FELLOW </p><p>JUSTICES.  HOWEVER, ONE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, WILSON </p><p>SANDURA, REPORTEDLY HAS COMMENTED PRIVATELY TO FRIENDS THAT </p><p>HE WOULD STEP DOWN IF CHIDYAUSIKU IS APPOINTED CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE, AND WE EXPECT OTHERS WOULD BE INCLINED TO FOLLOW </p><p>SUIT.  SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NICHOLAS MCNALLY IS EXPECTED </p><p>TO REACHED THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. </p><p>SUCH AN EXODUS WOULD PLAY INTO THE GOVERNMENT\'S HANDS, PAVING </p><p>THE WAY FOR THE PRESIDENT TO APPOINT JURISTS WILLING TO TOE </p><p>THE ZANU-PF LINE, A DEVELOPMENT WHICH WOULD HAVE A CHILLING </p><p>EFFECT ON THE RULE OF LAW AND CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY. </p><p>INDEED, GUBBAY\'S EARLY RETIREMENT -- AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>SURROUNDING IT -- HAVE SENT MANY ZIMBABWEANS INTO A PANIC, </p><p>AS THEY HAVE RELIED ON THE SUPREME COURT TO BE THE LAST </p><p>LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S CONSOLIDATION OF </p><p>ABSOLUTE POWER. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1791 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00644  02 OF 02  051552Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------C10612  051552Z /38 </p><p>O 051549Z FEB 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8173 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000644 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 02/05/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT HOUNDS SUPREME COURT CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE INTO RETIREMENT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00644  02 OF 02  051552Z </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
