REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Post has been in contact with the GOJ and the Dutch </p><p>Embassy this week regarding the Mullah Krekar case, and has </p><p>provided materials to assist the Jordanians with preparation </p><p>of their extradition request to the Netherlands.  This cable </p><p>recounts steps taken thus far.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Sunday September 15 </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Following weekend e-mails (ref d), Charge, PolCouns, </p><p>and Legatt met with Justice Minister Faris Nabulsi and raised </p><p>the Mullah Krekar issue.  We encouraged the Minister to </p><p>coordinate the GOJ\'s case with the Military Prosecutor\'s </p><p>Office and the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), as </p><p>well as with his Dutch counterpart.  After the meeting, the </p><p>Minister\'s Aide phoned PolCouns to say that the MOJ had </p><p>spoken to the Military Prosecutor\'s Office, who were in the </p><p>process of drafting preliminary documents to give to the </p><p>Dutch. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Monday September 16 </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) PolCouns met with Ali Al-Ayed, personal assistant to </p><p>FonMin Muasher, and Samer Naber, the MFA\'s Legal Advisor, </p><p>immediately after they had turned over the GOJ\'s preliminary </p><p>request for extradition to the Dutch DCM Peter Van der Vliet. </p><p> PolCouns offered USDOJ assistance to Jordan as it prepares </p><p>any subsequent submission for the Dutch court system. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Tuesday September 17 </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) PolCouns met with Dutch DCM Van der Vliet who reported </p><p>that initial indications from both the Dutch MOJ and MFA in </p><p>The Hague are that the 3-page Jordanian document submitted on </p><p>9/16 would be "good enough" to have Dutch custody over Mullah </p><p>Krekar extended for 20 days.  It would not, however, be </p><p>sufficient for a Dutch judge to order extradition.  Van der </p><p>Vliet mentioned that the GONL is considering sending a legal </p><p>expert to Jordan to help the Jordanians properly structure </p><p>its follow-on legal documents. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Wednesday September 18 </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) PolCouns met again with the MFA\'s Ali al-Ayed and </p><p>passed to him the DOJ/OIA materials on how to draft documents </p><p>for the Dutch legal system, and again offered USDOJ </p><p>assistance.  Al-Ayed commented that he didn\'t know how much </p><p>influence the MFA or MOJ would have on this case as the </p><p>Military Prosecutor\'s Office and GID are handling all of the </p><p>paperwork. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) ORCA has passed the same materials and has made the </p><p>same offers of USG assistance through their own channels. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  Given the nature of the charges in this case, it </p><p>is being handled by the State Security Court prosecutor\'s </p><p>office, and is being coordinated by the GID -- both entities </p><p>that have little institutional experience in preparing </p><p>documents for other legal systems.  In addition, the GOJ is </p><p>unclear about the legal hurdles it will have to clear in </p><p>presenting its more detailed extradition argument.  For </p><p>example, do the Jordanians merely have to show that they have </p><p>legitimate, pre-existing, and extraditable drug charges </p><p>against Krekar, or must they make a prima facie case </p><p>including evidence?  If they need to make a more detailed </p><p>case, to what degree of proof, and with what kind of evidence </p><p>(court records of the charges, transcripts of the confessions </p><p>of the convicted drug runners) must that case be made?  Does </p><p>the GOJ have to refer specifically to the Vienna Convention </p><p>and cite it as the basis for extradition, or will Dutch </p><p>prosecutors do that before the court?  Will the Dutch defense </p><p>be able to challenge the Jordanian evidence, the reputation </p><p>of Jordanian courts or the mixed civilian/military nature of </p><p>the State Security Court (in which the drug charges were </p><p>brought)?  How important is the format and use of specific </p><p>Dutch or English legal terms to the case? </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S/NF)   Finally, given that information on this case is </p><p>coming to the GOJ in different channels, and that we are not </p><p>confident of the level of Jordanian interagency coordination, </p><p>Embassy Amman would appreciate frequent readouts on the </p><p>status of the case so that we can be sure all involved GOJ </p><p>entities have the most current information. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
