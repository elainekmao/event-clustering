SUMMARY:  THE SPEECH OF SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL WAS </p><p>WIDELY COVERED IN THE UAE\'S PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  ABU </p><p>DHABI TV CARRIED THE SPEECH LIVE WITH ARABIC TRANSLATION. </p><p>HEADLINES IN SEMI-OFFICIAL "AL-ITTIHAD" DESCRIBED THE SPEECH AS </p><p>"A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST IRAQ," AND ITS EDITORIAL DECLARED </p><p>THAT POWELL\'S PRESENTATION LEAVES NO ROOM FOR THE IRAQI REGIME TO </p><p>MANEUVER ANY FURTHER.  "AL-BAYAN" CALLED THE SPEECH AS "PROOF </p><p>WHICH NEEDS PROOF".  AL-KHALEEJ" BANNERED THAT POWELL "PRESENTED </p><p>EVIDENCE OF (US) AGGRESSION".  EDITORIALS IN "AL-KHALEEJ" AND "AL- </p><p>BAYAN" CLAIMED THAT THE EVIDENCE IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND DOES NOT </p><p>JUSTIFY WAR.  HOWEVER, "AL-ITTIHAD" WARNED IRAQ OF GRAVE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES UNLESS BAGHDAD STOPS ITS MANEUVERING .  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "THE FINAL INDICTMENT PROCEDURE," ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED SEMI-OFFICIAL ARABIC DAILY "AL-ITTIHAD", WHICH </p><p>GENERALLY REFLECTS GOVERNMENT VIEWS, EDITORIALIZED 2/6: </p><p> </p><p>"WHAT CAME IN POWELL\'S LONG SUBMISSION TO THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS; IT GOES BEYOND SPEECHES AND MOBILIZATION </p><p>TO PAVE THE WAY FOR THE ACTUAL USE OF FORCE TO ELIMINATE IRAQ\'S </p><p>WMD THAT ARE CAREFULLY HIDDEN IN MOBILE CONTAINERS AND </p><p>CAMOUFLAGED POSITIONS IN IRAQ.... </p><p> </p><p>"THE AMERICAN SUBMISSION REFLECTS THE LIMITATIONS OF THE </p><p>INSPECTORS\' POWER AND THEIR INABILITY TO MONITOR, PURSUE AND </p><p>CONTROL MOBILE BANNED WEAPONS IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE REGIME HAS </p><p>LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE ARTS OF SURVIVAL, DESPITE THE CONTINUOUS </p><p>WAR IT HAS BEEN WAGING AGAINST ITS PEOPLE AND ITS NEIGHBORS EVER </p><p>SINCE IT CAME TO POWER IN THE SIXTIES.  THE AMERICAN SUBMISSION, </p><p>SUPPORTED BY IMAGES, PHONE INTERCEPTS, AND DETAILED CHARTS, LEFT </p><p>NO ROOM FOR EXTENDING THE INSPECTORS\' MISSION AND PUT EXTENSIVE </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO TAKE URGENT ACTION TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT THE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES WHICH THE UNSC WARNED OF IF </p><p>1441 WAS VIOLATED. IT ALSO NARROWED BAGHDAD\'S MARGIN FOR MANEUVER </p><p>AND CLOSED THE DOOR OF EVASIONS AND PROCRASTINATION WHICH BAGHDAD </p><p>USED IN THE PAST AS A WAY OUT OF ITS REPEATED CRISES WITH THE UN </p><p>AND ITS INSPECTORS." </p><p> </p><p>"THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT POWELL\'S PRESENTATION HAS OPENED THE </p><p>IRAQI CRISIS UP TO CATASTROPHIC POSSIBILITIES UNLESS BAGHDAD </p><p>STOPS ITS EFFORTS TO HIDE AND ELIMINATE ANY TRACE OF ITS BANNED </p><p>WEAPONS AND TAKES A STEP TOWARDS CLEARING THE HUGE CONGESTION </p><p>WHICH THREATENS TO EXPLODE.  ONLY THEN WILL IT GAIN THE SUPPORT </p><p>OF THE WORLD COMMUNITY WHICH SEEKS TO AVERT WAR BY ALL AVAILABLE </p><p>MEANS." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "EVIDENCE WHICH NEEDS SOMEONE TO BELIEVE </p><p>IT," SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ," KNOWN FOR ITS </p><p>VOCIFEROUS ANTI-AMERICAN RHETORIC, EDITORIALIZED: </p><p> </p><p>"THE U.S. IS ENDEAVORING TO PREPARE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>THEATERS FOR THE WAR IT IS READYING TO LAUNCH AGAINST IRAQ... </p><p>POWELL\'S SPEECH BEFORE THE UNSC YESTERDAY COMES WITHIN THE </p><p>FRAMEWORK OF SPEEDING UP THE AGGRESSION, ESPECIALLY AFTER HE </p><p>DELIBERATELY SHOWED SATELLITE IMAGES AND PHONE CONVERSATIONS IN </p><p>AN ATTEMPT TO DEMONSTRATE IRAQ\'S VIOLATION OF UNSCR 1441, WHICH </p><p>PERMITS EXPOSING IRAQ TO GRAVE CONSEQUENCES...POWELL AND OTHERS </p><p>WHO BLOW THE TRUMPETS OF WAR CAN PRESENT MORE IMAGES AND PHONE </p><p>CONVERSATIONS.  BUT WHO WOULD BELIEVE THEIR CREDIBILITY, SINCE </p><p>THE U.S. HAS (ALREADY) MADE ITS DECISION AND THE MOBILIZATIONS </p><p>HAVE REACHED THEIR PEAK?  ALL WE UNDERSTOOD FROM POWELL IS THAT </p><p>HE BROUGHT TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL EVIDENCE WHICH NEEDS SOMEONE </p><p>TO BELIEVE IT AND RATIFY IT IN ORDER TO FINALIZE THE WAR TO </p><p>DESTROY IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>4.  DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED: </p><p> </p><p>"THE EVIDENCE WHICH COLIN POWELL BROUGHT TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>MAY REPRESENT THE FIRST SCENE OF THE LAST CHAPTER IN THE IRAQI </p><p>CRISIS.  AFTER THAT MORE INTERESTING SCENES WILL FOLLOW, AS </p><p>AMERICA WANTS ACCORDING TO THE SCENARIOS THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARED </p><p>BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PENTAGON...IT IS </p><p>PREPARATION FOR WAR.  WHETHER THIS EVIDENCE IS TRUE OR </p><p>FABRICATED, IT IS ALL AIMED AT SATISFYING THOSE WHO ARE THIRSTY </p><p>TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR MILITARY MIGHT...WE THANK GOD THAT THERE ARE </p><p>SANE PEOPLE IN THE WEST WHO DO NOT FOLLOW AMERICA SUCH AS FRANCE </p><p>AND GERMANY...WHO BELIEVE THAT THE INSPECTORS MUST BE ALLOWED </p><p>TIME TO EVALUATE POWELL\'S EVIDENCE...THIS IS HOW THE VOICES OF </p><p>REASON ARE HEARD BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY, WHOSE EARS HAVE NOT </p><p>RECEIVED FROM THE ARABS ANY WORD AS WEIGHTY AS THOSE OF THE </p><p>FRENCH, THE GERMANS AND THE RUSSIANS." </p><p> </p><p>WILLIAMS </p><p></p></div>
