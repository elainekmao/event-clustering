<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002305 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED ANTI-BIOTECH </p><p>TRACT </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Beware of Americans bearing </p><p>      `gifts\'" the government-controlled daily "The Herald" </p><p>      published a silly anti-biotech article attributed to </p><p>      Raj Patel of "Third World Network Features": </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Food aid from U.S. is increasingly met with </p><p>      suspicion and skepticism by many who describe </p><p>      the export of unlabelled genetically modified </p><p>      food to needy nations as `a dangerous game </p><p>      played with the lives of starving people for </p><p>      political gain. . .\'  The U.S. Government has </p><p>      been playing this game for well over a decade; </p><p>      the famine in Southern Africa provided merely </p><p>      the latest installment. . .  The covert U.S. </p><p>      introduction of GM food into Africa is harmful, </p><p>      for four reasons.  First, there is mounting </p><p>      evidence that GM crops maybe unsafe. . . </p><p>      Second, the covert introduction of GM food in </p><p>      the Third World also jeopardizes the possibility </p><p>      of an independent non-GM food policy within the </p><p>      EU. . .  The third reason to be worried is that </p><p>      the GM food aid compromises the sovereignty of </p><p>      Southern African countries. . .  The reason poor </p><p>      countries now find themselves holding a begging </p><p>      bowl is because of the last `gift\' they accepted </p><p>      from the U.S. and EU: structural adjustment </p><p>      policies. . .  The notion of `saving lives </p><p>      through food aid\' rings a little hollow if we </p><p>      remember this; there were, prior to structural </p><p>      adjustment, ample ways to feed the people, </p><p>      without relying on frankenfood.  Southern </p><p>      African countries didn\'t have much of a choice </p><p>      about becoming beggars, but they can choose what </p><p>      to do next. . ." </p><p> </p><p>      3.  Comment:  Publication of this article shows </p><p>      continuing official Zimbabwean hostility toward </p><p>      biotech food in spite of the government\'s </p><p>      decision to accept it (with conditions) in food </p><p>      assistance. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
