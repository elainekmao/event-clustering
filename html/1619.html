HARTER, DCM, 1.5 B AND D </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) INTRODUCTION:  THE FOLLOWING IS THE FIRST OF A </p><p>TWO-PART ANALYSIS OF THE STATE OF U.S.-VIETNAM </p><p>RELATIONS.  IT FOCUSES ON THE BACKGROUND OF </p><p>"NORMALIZATION" AND WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED TO MEET USG </p><p>AS WELL AS VIETNAMESE INTERESTS.  IT WILL BE FOLLOWED </p><p>BY A SECOND MESSAGE THAT DELINEATES A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>NUMBER OF FRICTIONS IN THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WHICH HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. </p><p>THESE FRICTIONS ARE EXACERBATED BY THE RECENT AND </p><p>CONTINUING POWER STRUGGLE AMONG VIETNAMESE LEADERS </p><p>OVER PERSONAL STATUS AND STATURE IN THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY HIERARCHY AND OVER THE PACE OF POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM TO BE FOLLOWED IN THE COMING YEARS. </p><p>FAILURE TO TAKE NOTE OF THESE SENSITIVITIES IN </p><p>CARRYING OUT USG POLICY OBJECTIVES COULD RESULT IN A </p><p>SERIOUS SETBACK TO BILATERAL RELATIONS AND TO THE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS WE HAVE HAD IN BUILDING A NEW AND </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH A FORMER ENEMY.  END </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) LESS THAN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, THE RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM WAS ONE OF HOSTILITY. </p><p>VIETNAM\'S DECISION TO INVADE CAMBODIA IN 1978 CREATED </p><p>AN INTERNATIONAL UPROAR.  THE UNILATERAL U.S. EMBARGO </p><p>AND ISOLATION POLICY BECAME AN INTERNATIONAL POLICY, </p><p>EXCLUDING VIETNAM FROM VIRTUALLY ALL "NORMAL" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00762  01 OF 03  031013Z </p><p>DEALINGS.  FROM A VERY SLOW BUT STEADY BEGINNING, THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND VIETNAM HAVE TURNED THIS HOSTILITY </p><p>INTO AN UNPRECEDENTED SCOPE OF COOPERATION AND SHARED </p><p>BENEFIT.  ANNUAL MISSION AND INTER-AGENCY REVIEWS OF </p><p>NATIONAL OBJECTIVES IN VIETNAM HAVE CONFIRMED THE HIGH </p><p>PRIORITY WE HAVE ATTACHED TO THEIR ACHIEVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE SUCCESSES HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED VERY </p><p>QUICKLY, WITH MOST OF THE BENEFITS HAVING BEEN </p><p>ACHIEVED IN THE FIVE AND A HALF YEARS SINCE THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  THUS, IT IS </p><p>PERHAPS NOT READILY PERCEIVED IN THE U.S. THAT THIS </p><p>RELATIONSHIP REMAINS FRAGILE AND STILL SUBJECT TO </p><p>BEING PULLED APART BY MISPERCEPTIONS OF POLICY ON BOTH </p><p>SIDES. VIETNAM\'S LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE REMAINS IN A </p><p>STATE OF TRANSITION, MOVING FROM AN ELDER GENERATION </p><p>OF WAR-TIME HEROES TO A NATION WHERE THE QUESTIONS OF </p><p>EDUCATION, ECONOMIC WELL-BEING, AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>INTEGRATION ARE FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN IDEOLOGIES </p><p>BASED ON COMMUNIST THEORY.  THE LEADERS ARE SENSITIVE </p><p>TO THE FEAR THAT U.S. FAILURE TO OVERTHROW VIETNAM\'S </p><p>COMMUNIST STATE BY WAR HAS ONLY BEEN REPLACED BY A </p><p>"PLAN" TO DO SO THROUGH "PEACEFUL EVOLUTION" AND AN </p><p>UNDERMINING OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE COMMUNIST SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE LATE 1980\'S COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION </p><p>AND EASTERN EUROPE\'S COMMUNIST SYSTEM, CONVINCED </p><p>VIETNAM\'S LEADERS THEY COULD NOT SURVIVE IN THE WORLD </p><p>WITHOUT ADJUSTING THE COUNTRY\'S DOMESTIC POLICY (THE </p><p>GENESIS OF "DOI MOI" ECONOMIC REFORMS) AND ITS FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY (GETTING OUT OF CAMBODIA).  THE USG REACTION, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00762  01 OF 03  031013Z </p><p>FORMULATED BY THEN PRESIDENT BUSH AND HIS ADVISORS, </p><p>WAS TO BUILD A STEP-BY-STEP EXPANSION OF OFFICIAL </p><p>CONTACTS WITH THE VIETNAMESE.  THESE CONTACTS WERE </p><p>PREDICATED ON HANOI\'S WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA AND THE </p><p>START-UP OF A DEMOCRATIC ELECTION PROCESS IN THAT </p><p>COUNTRY.  THESE STEPS WERE PARALLELED BY A STRUCTURED </p><p>AND INTENSIFIED USG ATTENTION TO RESOLVING RESIDUAL </p><p>POW/MIA ISSUES WITH VIETNAMESE COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE EVOLUTION OF THIS PROCESS IN THE EARLY </p><p>1990\'S RESULTED IN VIETNAM\'S RESUMPTION AND INITIATION </p><p>OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AROUND THE WORLD AND ITS </p><p>MEMBERSHIP IN ASEAN AND THE ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM </p><p>(ARF).  VIETNAM BEG </p><p>AN A RAPPROCHEMENT WITH CHINA AND </p><p>SUBSEQUENT DIALOGUE WITH THE PRC LED TO THE CONCLUSION </p><p>OF A LAND AND GULF OF TONKIN BORDER DEMARCATION THAT </p><p>HAD VEXED THE TWO COUNTRIES FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. </p><p>VIETNAM WELCOMED INTERNATIONAL DONOR ASSISTANCE FROM </p><p>THE WORLD BANK, IMF, ADB AND A HOST OF BILATERAL </p><p>CONTRIBUTORS TO REBUILD ITS ECONOMY.  VIETNAM\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REINTEGRATION TO THE WORLD AND </p><p>THE REGION SERVED TO DIMINISH THE AREAS OF CONTENTION </p><p>AND BUILD A NEW POSSIBILITY FOR COOPERATION AND PEACE </p><p>WHERE THERE HERETOFORE HAD BEEN ALMOST CONTINUOUS </p><p>CONFLICT SINCE WORLD WAR II.  (OTHER PARTS OF THE </p><p>WORLD HAVE STILL NOT YET ACHIEVED THAT STABILITY SINCE </p><p>WORLD WAR II.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) BILATERALLY WITH THE U.S., A SERIES OF </p><p>DIALOGUES TO IMPROVE MIA-RELATED WORK RESULTED IN THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF AN OFFICIAL USG PRESENCE IN HANOI FOR </p><p>THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 1950\'S.  THIS PRESENCE </p><p>GRADUALLY PROGRESSED UNDER THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION </p><p>TO A STEP-BY-STEP OPENING UP OF DIRECT AND NORMAL </p><p>RELATIONS.  FROM THE LIFTING OF THE TRADE EMBARGO IN </p><p>FEBRUARY OF 1994 TO THE ENTRANCE ON DUTY OF THE FIRST </p><p>AMBASSADOR IN MAY 1997, THE U.S. AND VIETNAM ENGAGED </p><p>IN A PROCESS OF NORMALIZING RELATIONS DESIGNED TO </p><p>BUILD CONFIDENCE ON BOTH SIDES ABOUT WHAT COULD BE </p><p>ACCOMPLISHED.  IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. GOAL OF DEALING </p><p>WITH VIETNAM AS AN "INDEPENDENT" NATION, THE U.S. WAS </p><p>ALSO LOOKING MORE BROADLY AT A GROWING CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>CHINA\'S MILITARY AND ECONOMIC MIGHT.  THE U.S. SAW </p><p>VIETNAM AS A USEFUL "PARTNER" BECAUSE OF SHARED </p><p>CONCERNS OVER CHINA.  VIETNAM\'S INVOLVEMENT IN AND </p><p>WITH ASEAN WAS SEEN AS A WAY IN WHICH THE SOUTHWARD </p><p>ADVANCE OF CHINA\'S INFLUENCE MIGHT BE LESS CERTAIN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE DIRECT RESULT OF THIS ENGAGEMENT HAS BEEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00762  02 OF 03  031014Z </p><p>A TWENTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN OUR LISTS OF UNACCOUNTED </p><p>FOR AMERICANS THROUGH REPATRIATION AND IDENTIFICATION </p><p>OF REMAINS AND AN EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT CONCLUSION </p><p> CONSIDERED RECOVERABLE.  VIETNAM\'S MEMBERSHIP IN ASEAN </p><p> AND ARF WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE APEC IN 1998 AND OUR </p><p> INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE AND COOPERATION NOW INCLUDES </p><p> SHARED VOTING AND CANDIDATE SUPPORT WITHIN UN </p><p> AGENCIES.  EVEN BEFORE ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC </p><p> RELATIONS, THE TWO SIDES ENGAGED IN PRIVATE DISCUSSION </p><p> OF HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES OF CONCERN TO THE U.S. AND WE </p><p> HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY ADDED STRATEGIC POLICY TALKS AS WELL </p><p> AS SPECIFIC REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ISSUES AS </p><p> SEPARATE DIALOGUES.  WHILE WE STILL REMAIN FAR APART </p><p> ON OUR VIEWS OF BASIC FREEDOMS, VIETNAM\'S RECORD ON </p><p> THESE FRONTS HAS BEEN ONE OF MEASURED IMPROVEMENT -- </p><p> MORE INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS, MORE </p><p> ACTIVE INDIVIDUAL INVOLVEMENT IN RELIGIOUS WORSHIP, </p><p> MORE RELIGIOUS GROUPS OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED TO </p><p> OPERATE, AND FEWER INDIVIDUALS THROWN INTO PRISON </p><p> ARBITRARILY, TO NAME A FEW OF THE IMPROVEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p> 8.  (C) U.S.-VIETNAM RELATIONS ALSO HAVE A MILITARY- </p><p> TO- MILITARY DIMENSION, A DIRECT RESULT OF USG </p><p> INTENTIONS TO REDUCE THE BASIS FOR SUSPICIONS BETWEEN </p><p> THE TWO MILITARIES.  VIETNAMESE PARTICIPATION IN </p><p> MILITARY-RELATED PROGRAMS OPEN TO ASEAN MEMBERS AND </p><p> HIGH-LEVEL VISITS, INCLUDING THE VISIT OF THEN </p><p> SECRETARY OF DEFENSE COHEN HAVE PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES </p><p> FOR THE TWO SIDES TO BETTER COMPREHEND THE OTHER\'S </p><p> OBJECTIVES.  THIS PROCESS OF BUILDING UNDERSTANDING </p><p> HAS BEEN SLOW, AND BOTH SIDES HAVE CERTAINLY CAREFULLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00762  02 OF 03  031014Z </p><p> CALIBRATED EACH STEP IT WAS PREPARED TO TAKE.  U.S. </p><p> PROVISION OF INFORMATION RELATED TO VIETNAM\'S </p><p> BATTLEFIELD CASUALTIES, DISCUSSION OF CHEMICAL STORAGE </p><p> AND SPILL SITES, AND RELEASE OF GEOGRAPHICAL AND </p><p> TECHNICAL DATA RELATED TO AGENT ORANGE SPRAYING ALL </p><p> HELP TO DEAL WITH GVN SENSITIVITIES IN WHICH THE </p><p> MILITARY HAS TENDED TO TAKE AN ANTI-U.S. POSTURE OVER </p><p> THE YEARS. </p><p> </p><p> 9.  (C) AS IT WAS RE-ENGAGING DIPLOMATICALLY WITH THE </p><p> U.S., VIETNAM WAS ALSO SHIFTING ITS ECONOMIC </p><p> PRIORITIES FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT.  HANOI\'S </p><p> OBJECTIVES FOCUSED ON BUILDING MARKET-BASED MECHANISMS </p><p> INTO THE STATE-RUN ECONOMY AND OPENING UP TO FOREIGN </p><p> INVESTMENT.  THIS PROCESS, IN TURN, LED TO THE </p><p> NEGOTIATION AND CONCLUSION OF A BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>.AGREEMENT (BTA).  THIS AGREEMENT, A LANDMARK FOR BOTH </p><p> COUNTRIES, WOULD PROVIDE BOTH SIDES REAL BENEFITS IN </p><p> THE BILATERAL/INTERNATIONAL TRADING AND INVESTMENT </p><p>ARENA.  THE BTA BECAME COMPANIONED WITH A VARIETY OF </p><p>OTHER ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDING AGREEMENTS ON IPR AND S&T </p><p>COOPERATION WHICH COLLECTIVELY WILL LEAD VIETNAM TO A </p><p>MORE TRANSPARENT SYSTEM WHICH CAN DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE </p><p>TO A BETTER LIVELIHOOD FOR ITS PEOPLE.  U.S. AID AND </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ALSO BEGAN TO SHIFT </p><p>TO DISASTER MITIGATION, ENABLING VIETNAM FOR THE FIRST </p><p>TIME IN ITS HISTORY TO DEAL WITH THE RECURRING </p><p>PROBLEMS OF FLOODS, TYPHOONS, AND OTHER FORMS OF </p><p>NATURAL DISASTERS.  PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL U.S. </p><p>HUMANITARIAN DEMINING PROGRAM PROVIDED A CONCRETE </p><p>DEMONSTRATION OF U.S. INVOLVEMENT TO EASE THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF WAR.  AND, U.S. EDUCATION PROGRAMS </p><p>UNDER FULBRIGHT AND OTHER PRIVATE AND PUBLIC AUSPICES </p><p>HAVE CREATED THE FOUNDATION OF A YOUNGER GENERATION </p><p>WHICH LOOKS ON THE U.S. AS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION AND </p><p>NOT OF DEVASTATION. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE AVENUE FOR FURTHER U.S.-VIETNAM </p><p>COOPERATION WAS OPENED WIDE AS A RESULT OF THE CLINTON </p><p>VISIT LAST NOVEMBER. PUTTING BOTH CLOSURE TO THE </p><p>WARTIME-ERA OF HOSTILITY AND ADVERTISING A WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO DEAL WITH VIETNAM\'S NEW GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE, </p><p>THE U.S. MESSAGE WAS ONE OF EMPOWERMENT BROUGHT ON BY </p><p>THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OF THE NEW CENTURY.  IT WAS </p><p>A PROMISE OF ALMOST UNLIMITED SCOPE AND DURATION BASED </p><p>ON SHARED INTERESTS AND PERCEPTIONS FOR MODERNIZATION, </p><p>EXPANDED EDUCATION AND PROSPERITY.  BUT THAT </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MORE PROGRESS HAS SUDDENLY SLIPPED </p><p>AWAY AND THERE ARE NOW MORE CLOSED WINDOWS TO </p><p>COOPERATION AS THE RESULT OF HOSTILE PERCEPTIONS OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00762  03 OF 03  031014Z </p><p>U.S. ACTIONS AND MOTIVES AS WELL AS HOSTILE </p><p>PERCEPTIONS OF SOME OF VIETNAM\'S ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) COMMENT: THE STILL FRAGILE NATURE OF THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN COMPLICATED BY POLITICAL </p><p>TENSIONS INHERENT IN THE VIETNAMESE TRANSITION.  IT IS </p><p>ALSO HAMPERED BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PERCEPTIONS IN THE </p><p>U.S. THAT CONTINUE TO TREAT VIETNAM AS AN ENEMY. SOME </p><p>LEADERS IN VIETNAM NEED ONLY POINT TO ACTIONS BY </p><p>VIETNAMESE-AMERICANS OR OTHERS SEEKING TO REVITALIZE </p><p>PRE-1975 POSITIONS AGAINST THE HANOI AUTHORITIES TO </p><p>MAKE THEIR CASE.  THEY ARGUE THESE ACTIONS REPRESENT </p><p>THE NATIONAL POLICY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS BY THE USG OR ITS </p><p>AGENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AS  REPRESENTING ONLY U.S. </p><p>VIEWS OF "RIGHT AND WRONG." THE ACTIONS ARE OFTEN THEN </p><p>CHARACTERIZED AS HOSTILE TO THE INTERESTS OF VIETNAM </p><p>OR AS INTERFERENCE IN VIETNAM\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) THE COMBINATION OF THESE PERCEPTIONS HAS </p><p>RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT FRICTIONS BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO COUNTRIES THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE NATIONAL </p><p>PRIORITIES WE HAVE SET TO IMPROVE RELATIONS AND TO </p><p>MEET GLOBAL GOALS SUCH AS THE PROMOTION OF REGIONAL </p><p>STABILITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS OBSERVANCE. THE SECOND </p><p>MESSAGE ON THIS SUBJECT IDENTIFIES VIETNAM\'S </p><p>PERCEPTIONS OF THESE SENSITIVE AREAS. U.S. FAILURE TO </p><p>PROCEED SENSITIVELY ON THESE ISSUES COULD JEOPARDIZE </p><p>THE BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE SO RECENTLY ACHIEVED AS THE </p><p>RESULT OF OUR NORMALIZATION EFFORTS. </p><p>PPETERSON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00762  03 OF 03  031014Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
