<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001390 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/PDA (MBUCKLEY); IIP/G/WHA DIPASQUALE; EB/EPPD DCLUNE; </p><p>USTR AGASH </p><p>INFO IIP/T/ES </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, IOs, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA, ETRD, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAN ATMOSPHERICS ON CAFTA, JUNE 5-12, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1. Op-ed by Rodil Rivera in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La </p><p>Tribuna" (6/05) entitled "Frustration," "What has happened to all </p><p>the wealth that the bureaucrats assured us would come from CAFTA? </p><p>As we see it, the negotiations are stalling and the American </p><p>negotiators are offering less than Central America expected." </p><p> </p><p>2. San Pedro Sula-based Liberal daily "Tiempo," (06/06) ran an </p><p>article entitled "The US has cards hidden up its sleeve in the </p><p>CAFTA negotiations." "Some segments in the Honduran private </p><p>sector believe the U.S. is not responding to the expectations it </p><p>had aroused because, during the last round of negotiations in </p><p>Guatemala, it proposed a five-year tariff reduction program, </p><p>instead of offering to let goods enter the US tariff-free right </p><p>from the start of the agreement as Honduran business had </p><p>expected." </p><p> </p><p>3. Op-ed by Roger Marin in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El </p><p>Heraldo" (06/06) entitled, "Dangerous relationships," which says </p><p>that the signing of CAFTA is not supposed to provide all answers </p><p>to problems from agricultural productivity to the macro economy </p><p>and exchange rate balance.  "CAFTA can only be a mechanism to </p><p>creating a more prosperous and fairer economy, but that will be </p><p>our responsibility." </p><p> </p><p>4. San Pedro Sula-based Liberal daily "La Prensa"(6/08) carried </p><p>an interview with Jesus Canahuati, president of the Honduran </p><p>Association of Maquiladores and member of the CAFTA negotiation </p><p>team, entitled "Guatemala: reckless and confrontational in CAFTA </p><p>negotiations," in which he emphasized that there is a severe </p><p>conflict between the Guatemalan private sector and the </p><p>governmental team, who is carrying out the negotiations in a </p><p>reckless and unilateral manner. </p><p> </p><p>5. "La Tribuna" (6/09) featured an article entitled "Honduras </p><p>will not be fully aggressive on the fifth round of negotiations." </p><p>"None of the Central American teams will be belligerent during </p><p>the upcoming round towards the aggressive proposals of the U.S. </p><p>team. "This round will be key to finding out more about the U.S. </p><p>position on CAFTA." </p><p> </p><p>6. Article in "Tiempo" (6/09) entitled "CAFTA will lose income". </p><p>Honduran authorities have estimated that the country would lose </p><p>1.5 billion lempiras per year due to the decrease in tariff </p><p>revenues. </p><p> </p><p>7. "El Heraldo" (6/10) carried an interview with former Costa </p><p>Rican president Miguel Angel Rodriguez entitled, "We need to </p><p>negotiate more than just free trade." "Free trade with the US </p><p>beyond question beneficial, but Central America also needs to </p><p>include other issues, such as migration, cooperation and </p><p>compensation to social groups." </p><p> </p><p>8. Article in "El Heraldo" (6/10) entitled "Central America will </p><p>expand trade offer to the US" reports that the Central American </p><p>negotiation teams agreed to expand the trade offer to the US from </p><p>58% to 75%. This proposal that will be presented in the fifth </p><p>round of negotiations means that the basket of goods included in </p><p>the agreement went from 3,700 to 4,800 products. "This means that </p><p>the next round will be key because the real negotiations will </p><p>kick off." </p><p> </p><p>9. Article in "La Prensa" (6/11) entitled "Guatemala will </p><p>negotiate by itself." The discrepancies among the Central </p><p>American teams have become evident since Guatemala announced it </p><p>might present its own trade offer to the U.S. in the Fifth round. </p><p>Guatemalan private groups have criticized their government\'s </p><p>proposal for not considering the interests of the entire country. </p><p> </p><p>10. An article in "La Tribuna" (6/11) entitled, "Central American </p><p>textile entrepreneurs are finishing up their proposal to U.S.," </p><p>says the proposal will consider the needs of the textile and </p><p>clothes-making sector, stressing the importance of textiles in </p><p>CAFTA. The Central American textile entrepreneurs are also </p><p>assessing the advantages and disadvantages of the U.S. proposal </p><p>for their industry. </p><p> </p><p>11. Article in "La Prensa" June 12, entitled "Tegucigalpa will be </p><p>the starting point of the negotiations," sees the fifth round as </p><p>the real beginning of CAFTA negotiations.  It also goes on to say </p><p>that Honduras will present a concrete proposal on labor </p><p>integration. </p><p> </p><p>12. An article in "EL Heraldo", 6/12), entitled "Textile </p><p>counterproposal is ready to be presented to the U.S.," says that, </p><p>according to Honduran maquila owners, the most critical issues </p><p>are the rules of origin, access to plain fabrics and the </p><p>definition of "preferences" in U.S. market access. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
