(C) WITH ONE GREAT EXCEPTION, THE THIRD YEAR OF THE RACAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00107  01 OF 05  151634Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT RESEMBLED THE FIRST TWO:  CROATIA MADE MODEST </p><p>PROGRESS ON SOME REFORM ISSUES, STUMBLING FORWARD WHILE </p><p>SPENDING FAR TOO MUCH ENERGY AND TIME ON POLITICAL INFIGHTING </p><p>IN A HIGHLY DYSFUNCTIONAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.  ON OTHER </p><p>ISSUES IMPORTANT TO CROATIA\'S FUTURE, THE GOVERNMENT MADE NO </p><p>PROGRESS AT ALL, SQUANDERING OPPORTUNITIES WHICH MAY NEVER BE </p><p>RECAPTURED.  OF COURSE, THE YEAR\'S MOST SIGNIFICANT EVENT BY </p><p>FAR WAS THE RACAN GOVERNMENT\'S MISHANDLING OF THE ICTY </p><p>INDICTMENT AGAINST RETIRED GENERAL JANKO BOBETKO.  AS </p><p>EVERYONE (INCLUDING WE) PREDICTED, THE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE </p><p>RACAN GAINED BY FAILING TO DELIVER THE INDICTMENT IMMEDIATELY </p><p>HAS ALREADY EVAPORATED.  THE DAMAGE DONE TO CROATIA\'S </p><p>REPUTATION ABROAD WILL LAST MUCH LONGER. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) DIFFICULT AS IT IS TO BELIEVE, CROATIA\'S GOVERNMENT </p><p>WILL BECOME EVEN MORE INEFFICIENT IN THE YEAR AHEAD AS </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE COALITION SEEK TO </p><p>MAKE THEMSELVES DISTINCT TO VOTERS.  THE RACAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>WILL TRY TO GET CROATIA\'S BID FOR EU MEMBERSHIP BACK ON THE </p><p>RAILS, BUT IT WILL BE CHALLENGED TO MAKE MUCH PROGRESS, SINCE </p><p>EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS IN THE WAKE OF THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT </p><p>ARE MORE SKEPTICAL.  BY LAW, THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT CAN </p><p>DELAY ELECTIONS UNTIL EARLY 2004.  RACAN WOULD LIKE TO PUT </p><p>OFF ELECTIONS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE MORE PROGRESS ON </p><p>CONCRETE ISSUES POPULAR WITH VOTERS.  A MORE REALISTIC </p><p>EXPECTATION IS THAT RELATIONS WITHIN THE COALITION WILL </p><p>DETERIORATE FURTHER AND AT SOME POINT WILL BECOME AN </p><p>UNPALATABLE CHOICE EVEN FOR RACAN\'S SDP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON THE ISSUES MOST IMPORTANT TO US, THE REPORT CARD </p><p>FOR THE THIRD YEAR OF THE RACAN GOVERNMENT IS MIXED, WITH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00107  01 OF 05  151634Z </p><p>HIGH MARKS ON ISSUES LIKE ANTI-TERRORISM COOPERATION AND </p><p>DEVELOPING PRODUCTIVE RELATIONS WITH THE FRY, PASSING GRADES </p><p>ON SOME ECONOMIC AND A FEW DOMESTIC REFORM ISSUES, LOW MARKS </p><p>ON COOPERATION WITH ICTY, AND FAILING GRADES ON JUDICIAL </p><p>REFORM AND REFUGEE RETURN AND REINTEGRATION ISSUES.  END </p><p>SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>WASTING TIME ON COALITION POLITICS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) FULLY THREE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE ELECTIONS IN </p><p>WHICH A CENTER-LEFT COALITION LED BY PM RACAN\'S SDP CAME TO </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  IN JANUARY 2000, THE EXPECTATIONS OF CROATIAN </p><p>VOTERS -- AND OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- WERE HIGH, </p><p>PERHAPS UNREALISTICALLY SO.  THAT COALITION WAS BROUGHT </p><p>TOGETHER (WITH OUR ACTIVE ENCOURAGEMENT) WITH A SINGLE </p><p>PURPOSE: TO GET RID OF THE HDZ GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>CROATIA\'S ISOLATION.  ONCE THAT GOAL WAS ACCOMPLISHED, THERE </p><p>WAS LITTLE CONSENSUS WITHIN THE COALITION ON HOW TO MOVE </p><p>FORWARD.  AS TIME PROGRESSED, THIS LACK OF SHARED VISION, </p><p>COUPLED WITH PM RACAN\'S INDECISIVE LEADERSHIP STYLE, HAS </p><p>MEANT THAT EVERY TOUGH ISSUE, WHETHER ON ICTY COOPERATION, </p><p>REFUGEE RETURN, ECONOMIC REFORM, SOCIAL POLICY OR MILITARY </p><p>RESTRUCTURING, HAS DETERIORATED INTO A BICKERING BATTLE </p><p>BETWEEN COALITION PARTNERS.  THIS YEAR, THAT PROCESS RESULTED </p><p>IN ENDLESS THREATS OF RESIGNATIONS AND RUMORS OF SNAP </p><p>ELECTIONS SO COMMON THEY WERE HARDLY NEWS ANYMORE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, RACAN\'S BIGGEST </p><p>OBSTACLE TO GETTING ANYTHING DONE WAS HIS OPPOSITION FROM </p><p>WITHIN THE COALITION BY DRAZEN BUDISA\'S CROATIAN SOCIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00107  01 OF 05  151634Z </p><p>LIBERAL PARTY (HSLS).  AFTER BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO </p><p>APPEASE THE OBSTRUCTIONIST, IMPERIOUS BUDISA, RACAN FINALLY </p><p>RESIGNED IN JULY, DISSOLVING THE GOVERNMENT IN A TACTICAL </p><p>MANEUVER TO RECONSTITUTE THE COALITION A MONTH LATER WITHOUT </p><p>THE HSLS.  BUT GETTING RID OF BUDISA DID NOT GET RID OF </p><p>RACAN\'S PROBLEMS.  WITH THE NARROWEST OF MAJORITIES IN THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT, THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW HOSTAGE TO THE SPECIAL </p><p>INTERESTS OF EACH OF THE SMALL COALITION PARTIES.  FOR THE </p><p>MOST PART, RACAN\'S SDP HAS MANAGED TO BULLY ITS WAY FORWARD, </p><p>BUT NOT WITHOUT EXTREME, TIME CONSUMING EFFORT, AND ALMOST </p><p>NEVER WITHOUT THE RESENTMENT OF SMALLER PARTNERS. </p><p> </p><p>CHANGING POLITICAL LANDSCAPE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE CROATIAN PEASANTS\' PARTY (HSS) IS NOW RACAN\'S </p><p>SECOND LARGEST COALITION PARTNER.  ALTHOUGH SMALL IN NUMBERS, </p><p>IT IS BROADLY RECOGNIZED TO BE THE KINGMAKER ESSENTIAL FOR </p><p>THE NEXT COALITION TO FORM A GOVERNMENT, WHETHER IT IS LED BY </p><p>THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT.  THE HSS SEES ITSELF AS A TRADITIONAL </p><p>RIGHT-OF-CENTER PARTY, BUT IT IS REALLY ALL ABOUT POPULIST </p><p>CONSTITUENT SERVICE, ENSURING THAT WHILE IT IS IN GOVERNMENT, </p><p>ITS ELECTORATE IS WELL TAKEN CARE OF.  IN CONCRETE TERMS, </p><p>THAT HAS MEANT RISKING VIOLATING WTO COMMITMENTS WITH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2254 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00107  02 OF 05  151753Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------2605E9  151753Z /45 </p><p>P 151544Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9208 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 05 ZAGREB 000107 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA: THREE YEARS OF POST-TUDJMAN GOVERNMENT; A </p><p>MIXED REPORT CARD </p><p> </p><p>INAPPROPRIATE AGRICULTURE SUBSIDIES, SLOWING DOWN </p><p>PRIVATIZATION AND INSISTING ON A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF </p><p>POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN THE GOVERNMENT.  THE CENTER-LEFT </p><p>CROATIAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY (HNS) IS THE OTHER KEY PLAYER IN THE </p><p>RACAN GOVERNMENT.  ALTHOUGH ITS REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT </p><p>IS SMALL, ITS FORTUNES (AND POLLING NUMBERS) ARE ON THE RISE. </p><p> VESNA PUSIC, THE HNS\' POPULAR LEADER, IS CONVINCED THAT THE </p><p>LONGER THE COALITION REMAINS IN GOVERNMENT, THE MORE VOTERS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00107  02 OF 05  151753Z </p><p>WILL RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE ECONOMIC STABILITY IT HAS </p><p>BROUGHT ABOUT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE BIGGEST CHANGE ON THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN THE </p><p>PAST YEAR HAS BEEN THE ATTEMPTS OF THE OPPOSITION HDZ TO </p><p>RE-PACKAGE ITSELF AS A "REFORMED" PARTY.  THE HDZ APPEARS TO </p><p>BE SUCCEEDING IN CHANGING ITS IMAGE, EVEN IF IT REMAINS </p><p>LARGELY UNREFORMED.  NOW, EVERY DECISION RACAN MAKES IS </p><p>INFLUENCED BY HIS FEAR OF LOSING POLITICAL SUPPORT.  VOTERS </p><p>WHO SUPPORTED HIS COALITION THREE YEARS AGO MAY NOW NO LONGER </p><p>SEE THE HDZ AS AN UNPALATABLE CHOICE.  HDZ PRESIDENT SANADER </p><p>HAS WORKED HARD TO CHANGE THE IMAGE OF HIS PARTY.  AFTER </p><p>NARROWLY DEFEATING HARD-LINE TUDJMAN HATCHET MAN IVIC PASALIC </p><p>IN A BRUISING BATTLE FOR THE TOP PARTY SPOT IN APRIL, HE USED </p><p>ALL MEANS FAIR AND FOUL TO PURGE THE HDZ OF HIS RIVAL\'S </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  WHILE SANADER\'S MOTIVATION MAY HAVE BEEN SIMPLE </p><p>POLITICAL REVENGE, THE RESULT IS THAT SOME OF THE HDZ\'S MOST </p><p>CORRUPT ELEMENTS ARE NOW ON THE OUTSIDE.  THERE ARE STILL </p><p>PLENTY OF UNSAVORY CHARACTERS IN THE SENIOR RANKS OF HDZ. </p><p>OSIJEK STRONGMAN AND WAR CRIMINAL BRANIMIR GLAVAS COMES </p><p>IMMEDIATELY TO MIND.  BUT SANADER\'S HDZ RECENTLY HAS TAKEN </p><p>REASONABLE POSITIONS ON A NUMBER OF KEY ISSUES, INCLUDING ON </p><p>A NEW LAW ON MINORITY RIGHTS.  AS 2002 DREW TO A CLOSE, THE </p><p>HDZ WAS THE HIGHEST-POLLING POLITICAL PARTY IN CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>BOBETKO INDICTMENT AND CROATIA\'S GOOD NAME </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) RACAN\'S DECISION TO DELAY SERVING THE BOBETKO </p><p>INDICTMENT WAS DRIVEN BY HIS BELIEF THAT, IF HE DID NOT GIVE </p><p>THE PUBLIC THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS PUTTING UP A GOOD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00107  02 OF 05  151753Z </p><p>FIGHT, HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD FALL AND RIGHT-WING NATIONALISTS </p><p>WOULD RETURN TO POWER.  THE INITIAL PUBLIC REACTION TO THE </p><p>INDICTMENT WAS EMOTIONAL.  IT SHOCKED MANY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS WHO THOUGHT THAT CROATIA HAD EVOLVED PAST SUCH </p><p>VISCERAL NATIONALISM.  THERE WAS REAL CONCERN BOTH IN AND OUT </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT THAT HARDLINERS WOULD FOMENT VIOLENT UNREST AND </p><p>TOPPLE THE GOVERNMENT.  YET EVEN AFTER THE WAVE OF EMOTIONAL </p><p>NATIONALISM HAD CLEARLY PASSED, RACAN SEEMED INTOXICATED BY </p><p>THE INITIAL POSITIVE REACTION TO WHAT THE PUBLIC PERCEIVED AS </p><p>DEFIANCE OF ICTY\'S INDICTMENT "IN DEFENSE OF THE DIGNITY OF </p><p>THE HOMELAND WAR."  HE WAS DEAF TO WARNINGS FROM THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT HIS RHETORIC AND DELAYS IN </p><p>SERVING THE INDICTMENT WERE GRAVELY DAMAGING CROATIA\'S </p><p>REPUTATION.  FOR WEEKS AFTER IT BECAME CLEAR THAT HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS IN NO DANGER FROM THE RIGHT WING, RACAN </p><p>DELAYED, HOPING TO SCORE MORE POINTS, PUTTING DOMESTIC </p><p>POSTURING BEFORE INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) RACAN\'S BUMP IN THE POLLS OVER BOBETKO IS LONG GONE. </p><p>THE REVULSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, NOTABLY OF EU </p><p>STATES, AT THE MANIFESTATION OF UNDILUTED NATIONALISM </p><p>REMAINS.  AT LEAST TWO HAVE SLOWED RATIFYING THE EU\'S </p><p>STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (SAA) WITH CROATIA. </p><p>NO LONGER ARE CROATIA\'S SUPPORTERS IN THE EU WILLING TO GIVE </p><p>RACAN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ON ISSUES LIKE REFUGEE RETURN </p><p>AND PROPERTY RESTITUTION.  THE GOVERNMENT IS FACING TOUGH </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS SUPPOSED EFFORTS TO APPREHEND GENERAL </p><p>ANTE GOTOVINA, THE 2001 ICTY INDICTEE STILL AT LARGE.  EVEN </p><p>THE CROATIAN PRESS, POURING FUEL ON THE JINGOIST FIRE JUST </p><p>WEEKS AGO, NOW CRITICIZES RACAN FOR FAILING TO SHOW </p><p>LEADERSHIP DURING THE CRISIS.  RACAN\'S SDP HAS SLID BEHIND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00107  02 OF 05  151753Z </p><p>THE HDZ IN THE POLLS AND SEEMS TO BE LOSING MORE GROUND EVERY </p><p>WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE RACAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE LEARNED </p><p>ANY LESSONS FROM THIS UNFINISHED AFFAIR.  IN THE ABSENCE OF </p><p>CLEAR LEADERSHIP, CROATIA WILL FACE SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS EACH </p><p>TIME AN INDICTMENT IS HANDED DOWN.  SINCE THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>DELIVERED THE INDICTMENT TO THE LOCAL COURT OF JURISDICTION, </p><p>CROATIA CAN ONCE AGAIN FORMALLY BE CONSIDERED TO BE </p><p>COOPERATING WITH THE TRIBUNAL, BUT IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT </p><p>RACAN WOULD EVER FORCIBLY SEND AN INDICTEE TO THE HAGUE. </p><p>WHILE CROATIAN WITNESSES CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH THE </p><p>OFFICE OF THE TRIAL PROSECUTOR, THEY, TOGETHER WITH THE </p><p>INDICTEES, ARE CONTROLLING THE PACE OF CROATIA\'S COOPERATION, </p><p>RATHER THAN THE RACAN GOVERNMENT ITSELF. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) ONE OF THE LONGER-LASTING EFFECTS OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S MISHANDLING OF THE BOBETKO IS THAT DEPUTY PRIME </p><p>MINISTER GORAN GRANIC, WHO REMAINS RACAN\'S "GO-TO" MAN ON A </p><p>BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES, HAS BECOME EMBITTERED AND RESENTFUL </p><p>AND MAY BE LESS WILLING TO ENGAGE ON ISSUES IMPORTANT TO US. </p><p>GRANIC HAS MANAGED CROATIA\'S RELATIONS WITH ICTY SINCE THE </p><p>RACAN GOVERNMENT CAME TO POWER.  HIS DEEPLY HELD EMOTIONAL </p><p>VIEW REMAINS THAT THE TEXT OF THE INDICTMENTS CALL INTO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2257 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00107  03 OF 05  151753Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------260604  151753Z /45 </p><p>P 151544Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9209 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 05 ZAGREB 000107 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA: THREE YEARS OF POST-TUDJMAN GOVERNMENT; A </p><p>MIXED REPORT CARD </p><p> </p><p>QUESTION CROATIA\'S RIGHT TO DEFEND ITS TERRITORY AND </p><p>"CRIMINALIZED" CROATIA\'S HOMELAND WAR.  THAT VIEW DROVE THE </p><p>UNHELPFUL POLICY AND CHEST-THUMPING RHETORIC AT THE START OF </p><p>THE BOBETKO AFFAIR.  RACAN TOOK OVER DIRECT MANAGEMENT OF THE </p><p>ISSUE FOR THE PEAK OF THE CRISIS, BUT NOW THAT IT IS OUT OF </p><p>THE HEADLINES, GRANIC IS AGAIN MANAGING THE ISSUE AND HIS </p><p>VIEWS HAVE NOT CHANGED, HIS RESENTMENT IS AGAIN CREEPING INTO </p><p>HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00107  03 OF 05  151753Z </p><p> </p><p>STUMBLING FORWARD, MUDDLING THROUGH </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) CROATIA HAS MADE PROGRESS ON SOME KEY REFORMS, BUT </p><p>THE PROCESS NEARLY ALWAYS CREATES SO MUCH BAD FEELING THAT </p><p>EVEN COMMITTED REFORMERS ARE LOSING MOTIVATION.  THE NEW </p><p>MINORITIES LAW IS A GOOD EXAMPLE:  THE RESULT WAS WELCOMED BY </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS WELL AS BY CROATIA\'S </p><p>MINORITIES AS A SOLID STEP FORWARD, BUT THE PROCESS OF </p><p>GETTING IT PASSED WAS SO ACRIMONIOUS THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>MANAGED TO ALIENATE MOST LEADERS OF CROATIA\'S ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES, AND EVEN MADE THE HDZ SEEM LIKE THE REASONABLE </p><p>BROKERS WHO FINALLY PUT THE DEAL TOGETHER.  UNEMPLOYMENT IS </p><p>STILL VERY HIGH (16 PERCENT) AND REMAINS ONE OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S BIGGEST POLITICAL LIABILITIES, BUT EVEN THAT </p><p>INDICATOR IS SHOWING SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT.  BY FAILING TO </p><p>ADEQUATELY INCLUDE UNIONS IN THE DRAFTING PROCESS OF A NEW </p><p>LABOR LAW, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO LOSE </p><p>THE ENDORSEMENT OF LABOR LEADERS IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) CROATIA PASSED SWEEPING DEFENSE REFORMS AND A NEW </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE </p><p>RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS, INCLUDING A VITAL MILITARY DOWNSIZING </p><p>PLAN, HAS BEEN SPOTTY AT BEST, MIRED BY A MIXTURE OF </p><p>INSUFFICIENT POLITICAL WILL AND AN INSUFFICIENT BUDGET. </p><p>WHILE THE RESOURCE CHALLENGES ARE REAL, OPPORTUNITIES FOR </p><p>PROGRESS WERE LOST TO POLITICAL TURMOIL AND BICKERING ABOUT </p><p>APPOINTMENTS TO SENIOR POSITIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, CROATIA WAS </p><p>WELCOMED INTO NATO\'S MEMBERSHIP ACTION PLAN.  ITS EAGERNESS </p><p>TO JOIN THE ALLIANCE WILL BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO URGE THIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00107  03 OF 05  151753Z </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND ITS SUCCESSORS TO GET NECESSARY REFORMS ON </p><p>TRACK. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) THE RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO TOUT ITS RECORD ON </p><p>CREATING A CLIMATE OF MACROECONOMIC STABILITY.  THROUGHOUT </p><p>THIS THIRD YEAR IN OFFICE, IT MANAGED TO KEEP INTEREST RATES </p><p>LOW TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT, KEEP THE KUNA RATE STABLE, </p><p>INCREASE FOREIGN CURRENCY HOLDINGS AND AGAIN (AFTER A </p><p>TORTUOUS PROCESS) MANAGED TO COME TO AGREEMENT WITH THE IMF </p><p>ON A STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT.  BUT THESE RESULTS ARE SLOW TO </p><p>TRICKLE DOWN TO THE AVERAGE CROATIAN.  LACK OF PROGRESS ON </p><p>PRIVATIZATION AND JUDICIAL REFORM HAVE KEPT LEVELS OF FOREIGN </p><p>DIRECT INVESTMENT LOW.  GOVERNMENT DEBT IS REACHING WORRISOME </p><p>LEVELS, AS THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SUBSIDIZE LOSS-MAKING </p><p>INDUSTRIES.  HOWEVER, BY SLASHING TARIFFS AND KEEPING </p><p>INTEREST RATES LOW, THERE HAS BEEN A BOOM IN CONSUMER DEMAND </p><p>WHICH HAS PUMPED UP GROWTH AND IMPROVED SOME CROATIANS\' </p><p>STANDARD OF LIVING. </p><p> </p><p>GETTING BETTER AT REGIONAL RELATIONS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) THE RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS ASSERTED THAT </p><p>IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH CROATIA\'S NEIGHBORS IN THE REGION IS </p><p>A TOP FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITY, BUT RESULTS HAVE BEEN MIXED. </p><p>2002 WAS A BETTER YEAR: SLOVENIA FINALLY LET RACAN OFF THE </p><p>HOOK FOR HIS JULY 2001 GAFFE ON PIRAN BAY (INITIALING AN </p><p>UNRATIFIABLE MARITIME BORDER AGREEMENT).  CROATIA MAINTAINED </p><p>A GENERALLY POSITIVE STANCE TOWARDS BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, </p><p>AND WHILE IT MADE NO REAL PROGRESS ON RETURNS ISSUES (SEE </p><p>BELOW), IT RESOLVED A LONG-STANDING BORDER DISPUTE AT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00107  03 OF 05  151753Z </p><p>KOSTAJNICA AND CONTINUED TO ENCOURAGE BOSNIAN CROATS TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN THEIR OWN COUNTRY\'S CENTRAL INSTITUTIONS AND STOP </p><p>LOOKING TO ZAGREB.  THE MOST PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WITH </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA.  CROATIA AND YUGOSLAVIA FINALLY HAMMERED OUT A </p><p>DURABLE "TEMPORARY" DEAL ON THE PREVLAKA PENINSULA, LEADING </p><p>TO THE CLOSURE OF THE UN OBSERVER MISSION THERE.  CAPPING A </p><p>YEAR OF STEADILY IMPROVING ECONOMIC RELATIONS, ECONOMY </p><p>MINISTER JURCIC SIGNED A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH YUGOSLAVIA </p><p>IN BELGRADE ON DECEMBER 23.  CROATIA HAS MADE ENCOURAGING </p><p>NOISES ABOUT WORKING CLOSELY WITH MACEDONIA AND ALBANIA, THE </p><p>TWO OTHER "CONTINUING ASPIRANTS" FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>STRONG SUPPORT FOR ANTI-TERRORIST COALITION </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) CROATIA\'S SUPPORT IN THE WAR ON TERROR HAS BEEN </p><p>CONSISTENTLY STRONG.  IN ADDITION TO ITS CONTRIBUTION OF </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN APRIL, CROATIA MADE A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>DONATION OF WEAPONS AND MUNITIONS TO THE AFGHAN NATIONAL </p><p>ARMY, AND IN DECEMBER, THE PARLIAMENT APPROVED THE DEPLOYMENT </p><p>OF A UNIT OF MILITARY POLICE TO AFGHANISTAN IN SUPPORT OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE (ISAF).  WHILE THE </p><p>BALKY CROATIAN BUREAUCRACY HAS SO FAR PREVENTED PROGRESS ON A </p><p>MIO REGIME, CROATIA, WITH A LITTLE DIRECTION FROM US, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2260 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00107  04 OF 05  151754Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------26061C  151754Z /45 </p><p>P 151544Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9210 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 05 ZAGREB 000107 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA: THREE YEARS OF POST-TUDJMAN GOVERNMENT; A </p><p>MIXED REPORT CARD </p><p> </p><p>INTERDICTED AND SEIZED THE MV BOKA STAR, A TONGA-FLAGGED SHIP </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO SMUGGLE ROCKET PROPELLANT FROM MONTENEGRO, </p><p>PERHAPS FOR ONWARD DELIVERY TO IRAQ.

(C) THE MOST DISAPPOINTING FAILURE OF THE RACAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN THE DISPARITY BETWEEN RHETORIC AND </p><p>REALITY ON REFUGEE RETURNS AND PROPERTY RESTITUTION ISSUES. </p><p>THE NUMBERS OF ETHNIC SERBS RETURNING TO THEIR HOMES IN </p><p>CROATIA IN 2002 REMAINED FLAT WHILE NUMBERS ELSEWHERE WERE </p><p>PEAKING.  THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON ITS </p><p>COMMITMENTS -- AND ITS OWN LAW -- ON EVICTING BOSNIAN CROATS </p><p>FROM ILLEGALLY-OCCUPIED HOMES BELONGING TO SERBS.  WHILE </p><p>BUDGET SHORTFALLS WERE GENUINE, THE GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE </p><p>DONE MUCH MORE TO ENCOURAGE RETURNS.  DESPITE CONSISTENT </p><p>URGING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE RACAN GOVERNMENT </p><p>SIMPLY DID NOT MAKE THESE ISSUES A HIGH PRIORITY.  NOW, WITH </p><p>AN ELECTION YEAR IN THE OFFING, IT IS EVEN LESS LIKELY THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT WILL FOCUS ON RETURNS.  BOTH WE AND OUR </p><p>EUROPEAN COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE IT INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT </p><p>CROATIA MUST PERFORM ON THIS ISSUE IF IT HOPES TO PROGRESS </p><p>TOWARDS EU AND NATO MEMBERSHIP.  THIS IS A MESSAGE WE MUST </p><p>CONTINUE TO HAMMER HOME AT NATO, AS WE BELIEVE THE EU WILL </p><p>ALSO IN RESPONSE TO CROATIA\'S APPLICATION FOR CANDIDACY. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) CROATIA\'S JUDICIARY REMAINS THE SECTOR WHERE THE </p><p>RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS MADE THE LEAST PROGRESS ON REFORMS.  THE </p><p>LACK OF PROPERLY-FUNCTIONING CIVIL COURTS HAS BECOME AN </p><p>OBSTACLE TO REFORMS IN OTHER AREAS LIKE PRIVATIZATION AND </p><p>PROPERTY RESTITUTION.  BUT THE PROBLEMS IN CRIMINAL COURTS </p><p>HAVE MORE COSTLY EFFECTS: POOR PROCEDURE, LACK OF </p><p>ORGANIZATION, INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND -- MOST IMPORTANTLY </p><p>-- UNPROFESSIONAL JURISTS SUBJECT TO POLITICAL INFLUENCE HAVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00107  04 OF 05  151754Z </p><p>MEANT THAT SOME SERIOUS CRIMES HAVE GONE UNPUNISHED.  THE </p><p>LACK OF LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO JUDICIAL REFORMS HAS HAD </p><p>AN IMPACT ON OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  USAID </p><p>RECENTLY TERMINATED AN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WITH THE ZAGREB </p><p>MUNICIPAL LAND REGISTRY, AFTER TWO YEARS OF MIXED RESULTS. </p><p>THE REGISTRY\'S MULTIYEAR BACKLOG IS A MAJOR BARRIER TO BOTH </p><p>FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INVESTMENT, YET THE COURT RESISTED ALL </p><p>EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT MEANINGFUL MANAGERIAL REFORMS. </p><p>SIMILARLY, PROGRESS ON AN ONGOING JOINT WORLD BANK/USAID </p><p>PROGRAM TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A NEW COURT AND CASE </p><p>MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN COMMERCIAL COURTS COUNTRY-WIDE HAS BEEN </p><p>SLOWED TO A CRAWL DUE TO A MINISTRY OF JUSTICE THAT IS </p><p>UNCOOPERATIVE AND RESISTANT TO REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (C) THERE IS SOME HOPE FOR CHANGE.  ALTHOUGH THE JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER CONTINUES TO DISAPPOINT, CROATIA PASSED A NEW </p><p>CRIMINAL CODE AND INSTALLED A NEW, BUSINESSLIKE STATE </p><p>ATTORNEY IN 2002.  WHILE THE LORA WAR CRIMES TRIAL WAS A </p><p>SPECTACULAR FAILURE, THAT RULING COULD BE REVERSED ON APPEAL. </p><p> THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT MAY HAVE GIVEN NEW ENERGY AND URGENCY </p><p>TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS TO PROSECUTE WAR CRIMES </p><p>DOMESTICALLY. </p><p> </p><p>HOPES FOR EU AND NATO MEMBERSHIP </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  (C) EU MEMBERSHIP REMAINS CROATIA\'S TOP PRIORITY, AND IT </p><p>HAS MADE SOME IMPORTANT PROGRESS TOWARD THAT GOAL IN THE PAST </p><p>YEAR.  THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SUBMIT ITS FORMAL </p><p>APPLICATION IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2003.  THE EU\'S RESPONSE </p><p>WILL BE COLORED BY CROATIA\'S HANDLING OF THE BOBETKO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00107  04 OF 05  151754Z </p><p>INDICTMENT.  THE RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A "EUROPEAN </p><p>OFFENSIVE" IN WHICH THE PM WILL VISIT MOST EU CAPITALS IN THE </p><p>COMING MONTH TO TRY TO GET CROATIA BACK IN THE GOOD BOOKS OF </p><p>MEMBER STATES. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (C) NATO MEMBERSHIP REMAINS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, BUT HAS LESS SALIENCE WITH THE PUBLIC AFTER </p><p>PRAGUE; THE UNDERSTANDING THAT AN INVITATION IS YEARS AWAY </p><p>HAS FILTERED DOWN.  WITH U.S. FORCES ENGAGED ELSEWHERE, WE </p><p>HAVE LESS HIGH-PROFILE MILITARY ENGAGEMENT WITH CROATIA. </p><p> </p><p>LOOKING AHEAD </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C) AS 2003 UNFOLDS AND ELECTIONS APPROACH, THE RACAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL TRY TO FOCUS ON A NARROWER SET OF GOALS WITH </p><p>EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND APPEAL TO VOTERS.  ONE POLITICAL INSIDER </p><p>TOLD US THAT THE HSS WOULD NEVER CALL FOR NEW ELECTIONS WITH </p><p>A PAPAL VISIT ON THE CALENDAR FOR JUNE.  SINCE THEY WOULD NOT </p><p>RISK BEING BLAMED FOR DISRUPTING THE TOURIST SEASON EITHER, </p><p>THE MOST LIKELY DATE FOR ELECTIONS WOULD BE OCTOBER 2003, </p><p>BEFORE THE BUDGET HAS TO BE PASSED.  ELECTIONS MUST TAKE </p><p>PLACE BEFORE APRIL 2004, WITHIN SIXTY DAYS AFTER THE END OF </p><p>THE CURRENT SABOR\'S FOUR-YEAR TERM, WHICH BEGAN WHEN THE NEW </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2266 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00107  05 OF 05  151754Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------260632  151754Z /45 </p><p>P 151544Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9211 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 05 OF 05 ZAGREB 000107 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA: THREE YEARS OF POST-TUDJMAN GOVERNMENT; A </p><p>MIXED REPORT CARD </p><p> </p><p>PARLIAMENT FIRST CONVENED IN FEBRUARY 2000.  THAT LIKELY </p><p>MEANS CROATIA -- AND WE -- FACE A LONG CAMPAIGN SEASON IN </p><p>WHICH LITTLE PROGRESS IS MADE ON THE ISSUES MOST IMPORTANT TO </p><p>US. </p><p> </p><p>23.  (C) POLLS SHOW THAT THIS ELECTION IS RACAN\'S TO LOSE: </p><p>THE NUMBER OF RESPONDENTS WHO SAY THEY WILL VOTE, BUT HAVE </p><p>NOT DECIDED FOR WHOM, IS LARGER EVEN THAN THE HDZ\'S NUMBERS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00107  05 OF 05  151754Z </p><p>POLLSTERS TELL US THAT THIS NUMBER OF UNDECIDED VOTERS IS </p><p>INCREASING IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO SDP\'S LOSSES IN THE POLLS. </p><p> ALL OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES LIKELY TO WIN SEATS IN THE NEXT </p><p>PARLIAMENT HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY WILL NOT JOIN A PRE-ELECTION </p><p>COALITION, BUT ALL READILY RECOGNIZE THAT THE DAYS OF A </p><p>SINGLE-PARTY GOVERNMENT ARE GONE.  THAT SHOULD HAVE THE </p><p>SALUTATORY EFFECT OF FORCING THE HDZ TO MOVE TO THE CENTER, </p><p>TO MAKE IT A PALATABLE CHOICE FOR POTENTIAL COALITION </p><p>PARTNERS. </p><p> </p><p>24.  (C) OUR STRONGLY HELD VIEW REMAINS THAT THE HDZ HAS NOT </p><p>YET EVOLVED ENOUGH TO MAKE IT A GOOD CHOICE FOR CROATIA\'S </p><p>FUTURE AND WILL NOT SOON.  IF RACAN IS TO SUCCEED, HE NEEDS </p><p>TO USE THE COMING YEAR TO CONVINCE VOTERS THAT A COALITION </p><p>LED BY THE SDP WOULD BRING CROATIA CLOSER TO ITS GOALS THAN </p><p>THE HDZ.  IT IS STILL IN OUR INTERESTS TO HELP HIM ACHIEVE </p><p>THIS GOAL.  AS CROATIA HAS MATURED, SO HAS THE ROLE OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS.  RATHER </p><p>THAN THE ACTIVIST, INTERVENTIONIST POLICY WE SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>IMPLEMENTED TO GET RACAN\'S COALITION ELECTED, WE INTEND IN </p><p>THIS ELECTION SEASON TO FOCUS ON HELPING COALITION PARTIES </p><p>FOCUS THEIR MESSAGES AND GET OUT THE VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>25.  (C) WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>MOVE FORWARD WITH REFORMS ON ALL FRONTS.  WHILE ELECTION </p><p>PRESSURES MAY MAKE THEM LESS RESPONSIVE TO US, OUR EU </p><p>COLLEAGUES WILL LIKELY HAVE MORE LEVERAGE, SINCE MANY VOTERS </p><p>WILL MAKE THEIR CHOICE BASED ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY THEY THINK </p><p>CANDIDATES WILL MOVE CROATIA TOWARDS THE EU.  THIS IS A GOOD </p><p>THING, SINCE MORE THAN EVER, WE AND THE EU ARE PUSHING </p><p>CROATIA TO MAKE THE SAME CHOICES, AND THE EU IS PUSHING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00107  05 OF 05  151754Z </p><p>HARDER THAN IN THE PAST. </p><p> </p><p>26.  (C) PART OF THE REASON WE GIVE THE RACAN GOVERNMENT SUCH </p><p>LOW MARKS IS BECAUSE THREE YEARS AGO WE HAD SUCH HIGH </p><p>EXPECTATIONS.  AND YET THE COALITION GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO </p><p>LIVE UP TO CROATIAN VOTERS\' AND OUR OWN HOPES, IT HAS MADE </p><p>SOME IMPORTANT PROGRESS.  CROATIA HAS BROUGHT INCREASED </p><p>STABILITY TO SOUTHEAST EUROPE.  BUT IF IT SHOWS NOTHING ELSE, </p><p>THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT SHOWS HOW SHALLOW REFORMS ARE HERE. </p><p>OUR CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT IS VITAL TO ENSURE THAT CHANGES </p><p>BEGUN THREE YEARS AGO ARE INSTITUTIONALIZED. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
