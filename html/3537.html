<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001618 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL/AAE, INL/C, SA/INS AND DS/ATA </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OPDAT </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KCRM, SNAR, PINR, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: Seventeen Nepalese Bureaucrats Arrested in Anti- </p><p>Corruption Drive </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) Kathmandu 800, B) 01 State 158542 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action message.  Please see para 10. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary.  Seventeen Nepalese public officials </p><p>have been arrested after the government body charged with </p><p>investigating corruption raided the homes of 22 revenue </p><p>officers on August 17.  The houses of two joint </p><p>secretaries were among those searched.  A special court </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>has been named to hear the cases.  A commissioner from the </p><p>anti-corruption body told us that more such raids are </p><p>planned, and that state banks and other government </p><p>agencies have been asked to help with the investigation. </p><p>Recent legislation granted the CIAA greater powers and put </p><p>the burden of proof on public officials to prove where </p><p>they obtained their assets.  The CIAA has expressed an </p><p>interest in obtaining bilateral aid to build its </p><p>capacities.  The raids were widely lauded, but many </p><p>observers hope the CIAA goes after higher-level </p><p>bureaucrats and politicians next.  Now would be an </p><p>opportune time to provide the INL-funded OPDAT course on </p><p>prosecuting public corruption, which the GON agreed in </p><p>February to accept.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Corruption Body Arrests Sixteen in Nighttime Raids </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Sixteen Nepalese civil servants were arrested </p><p>during the night of August 17 after officers from the </p><p>Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority </p><p>(CIAA) searched the houses of 22 officials for evidence of </p><p>malfeasance or embezzlement.  A seventeenth official </p><p>surrendered to authorities August 19.  Five individuals </p><p>under investigation were out of town, and thus were not </p><p>detained.  Most worked in offices charged with collecting </p><p>taxes or customs duties. </p><p> </p><p>Two Joint Secretaries Among the Accused </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The two highest-ranking individuals charged were </p><p>joint secretary-level officers (equivalent to a U.S. </p><p>Assistant Secretary): Sri Ram Pant, Chief of the Revenue </p><p>Section at the Finance Ministry, and Janardan Sharma, </p><p>Chief of the Inland Revenue Office, Kathmandu Area Number </p><p>Two.  Pant was in Delhi at the time of the raid, and </p><p>cancelled his planned return to the capital August 18, </p><p>citing health problems. </p><p> </p><p>Special Court Nominated to Hear Cases </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) A three-member Special Court will be constituted to </p><p>hear these cases.  On August 20 Nepal\'s Judicial Council </p><p>agreed to put forward the names of three Appellate Court </p><p>judges to make up this body.  Embassy contacts confirm </p><p>that all three judges have unblemished records and </p><p>reputations for honesty and probity.  One contact noted, </p><p>however, that the three had never before been tested in </p><p>such high-profile cases. </p><p> </p><p>More Raids Planned </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) More raids are planned against other corrupt </p><p>officials, a CIAA Commissioner told us.  He added that </p><p>successful prosecution depends in large part on the level </p><p>of cooperation the Commission gets from both the courts </p><p>and the defendants.  With only limited personnel and </p><p>resources, the CIAA has had to draft officers from other </p><p>ministries to help with its investigation.  It has also </p><p>asked for expert assistance from Nepal\'s state banks and </p><p>line ministries to evaluate the evidence.  Funding from </p><p>the Danish aid agency pays for two experts, which is a </p><p>great help, the Commissioner noted. </p><p> </p><p>CIAA Exercising New Found Powers </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The CIAA Commissioner explained that the August </p><p>17 raids were the Commission\'s first attempt to use new </p><p>powers granted to it under recently enacted legislation </p><p>(Ref A).  Under the new law, the CIAA can investigate </p><p>anyone who appears to be living beyond his means.  The </p><p>burden of proof is on the defendant to prove how the </p><p>assets were obtained.  Those convicted of corruption face </p><p>from two to ten years in prison, confiscation of their </p><p>assets, and fines proportional to the value of the </p><p>illegally acquired property. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Senior Governance Officer at the Asian </p><p>Development Bank (ADB) in Kathmandu echoed the </p><p>Commissioner\'s comments about new legislation enlarging </p><p>the scope of the CIAA\'s activities.  Moreover, the ADB </p><p>also has concerns that the CIAA lacks the manpower and </p><p>training necessary to implement these changes.  The CIAA </p><p>has refused the ADB\'s offer of loans for this purpose, but </p><p>has indicated its interest in receiving grant aid from </p><p>bilateral donors. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Corruption is rife in Nepal.  Unfortunately, </p><p>previous attempts by the CIAA to prosecute corrupt public </p><p>officials have failed in court.  The newly-enacted </p><p>legislation described in Ref A should help to strengthen </p><p>the Commission.  So far, public reaction to the CIAA\'s </p><p>recent actions has been uniformly positive.  Even so, most </p><p>observers--both Nepali and expatriate--add that until the </p><p>CIAA lands a big fish (like a Minister or leading </p><p>politician), the Commission\'s efforts will have limited </p><p>impact. </p><p> </p><p>Action Request </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Last year INL agreed to fund Post request for an </p><p>OPDAT course titled "Prosecuting Public Corruption" (Ref </p><p>B).  To obtain approval to sign the INL\'s letter of </p><p>agreement for this course, Post engaged in protracted </p><p>negotiations with Finance Ministry, which had to seek </p><p>Cabinet-level approval before it would ink the document. </p><p>A date for the course has yet to be set by DOJ.  Bringing </p><p>the course to Nepal now would help to redress the CIAA\'s </p><p>training deficit and send a strong signal that the USG is </p><p>committed to helping Nepal combat corruption. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
