<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000955 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, SNAR, CU, GT, UNCHR-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY CALLS ON RULING PARTY TO URGE PORTILLO TO </p><p>SUPPORT CUBA CHR RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On April 9, the Guatemalan Congress passed an </p><p>unscheduled resolution calling on President Portillo to </p><p>abstain in the upcoming UNCHR resolution on Cuba.  Only one </p><p>independent congressman, Emilio Saca, voted against the </p><p>measure, saying that the Government of Cuba should be </p><p>censured for its deplorable human rights situation. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On instruction from the Ambassador, PolCouns met on </p><p>April 10 with the Congressional leadership of the ruling </p><p>party (the FRG - Frente Republicano Guatemalteco) to express </p><p>our disappointment with the Congressional resolution and to </p><p>urge them to take a principled position in support of the </p><p>jailed human rights activists, journalists, labor leaders and </p><p>other dissidents in Cuba.  Present for the FRG were First </p><p>Vice President of Congress Carlos Hernandez, Third Vice </p><p>President Jorge Arevalo and Majority Leader Aristides Crespo. </p><p> PolCouns relayed the details of the recent arrest and </p><p>summary trial of the dissidents, noted by name many of the </p><p>dissidents who are personally known to Ambassador Hamilton, </p><p>and argued that these individuals deserved the support of all </p><p>freedom-loving Latin Americans.  They had been arrested and </p><p>summarily tried in kangaroo courts for exercising the most </p><p>basic human rights that all Guatemalans enjoy and that are </p><p>strongly defended in Guatemala by the FRG.  It was </p><p>unconscionable that only Guatemalan labor leaders had spoken </p><p>out in the defense of the dissidents, and an abstention on </p><p>the UNCHR resolution on Cuba would only convince the GOC that </p><p>it had friends that were prepared to support it irrespective </p><p>of its deplorable behavior.  PolCouns asked them how the FRG </p><p>viewed the arrest of the dissidents. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Aristides Crespo responded that the arrest appeared </p><p>to be an injustice, but said that counter-narcotics </p><p>decertification of Guatemala by the USG was also viewed as an </p><p>injustice by them.  He said that many believed that it had </p><p>been done expressly to hurt the FRG in the upcoming </p><p>elections, and that the FRG believed that decertification was </p><p>unmerited.  He argued that if the USG wanted greater </p><p>cooperation on drugs from a poor country like Guatemala, it </p><p>needed to provide greater financial support to the effort. </p><p>PolCouns noted that since decertification the GOG had </p><p>accomplished several significant successes in the war on </p><p>drugs, in cooperation with us, but without new resources.  We </p><p>are pleased with the increase in counter-narcotics </p><p>cooperation and are prepared to continue providing all the </p><p>support possible.  However, the issue of supporting the Cuban </p><p>dissidents should be an issue of principle, not of bilateral </p><p>differences with us.  The FRG is known as a party of strong </p><p>principles, and we know that they support the principles of </p><p>free speech and free association for which the Cuban </p><p>dissidents were arrested and sentenced to long terms.  Surely </p><p>the FRG would find these principles much closer to their own </p><p>than the principles employed by the Cuban Government in </p><p>arresting these people. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) PolCouns asked if they had seen the draft Cuba </p><p>resolution tabled in Geneva by Costa Rica, Uruguay and Peru. </p><p>When they acknowledged they had not, PolCouns gave them a </p><p>copy and noted that it simply called for Cuba to allow the </p><p>visit of the UNCHR\'s Special Representative.  The UNCHR has </p><p>sent Special Representatives to Guatemala many times, and the </p><p>GOG has always welcomed them.  It is difficult for us to </p><p>understand why an FRG government would not vote in favor of </p><p>this resolution, as Guatemala certainly believes that all </p><p>governments should meet the same human rights standards that </p><p>have been applied here. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Crespo noted that, despite the Congressional </p><p>resolution, the decision on the Cuba vote is entirely the </p><p>Executive\'s.  When pressed, he acknowledged that they did </p><p>have some influence on the vote, and said they would relay </p><p>our request to the senior party leadership (i.e. President of </p><p>Congress Rios Montt). </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  The Congressional vote of April 9 may well </p><p>have been a face-saving move by the FRG to give Portillo </p><p>cover with the Cubans to abstain on the vote, vice the "no" </p><p>vote the Cubans had hoped for.  The linkage between not </p><p>supporting us on Cuba and the recent decertification of </p><p>Guatemala for counter-narcotics cooperation, naked as it is, </p><p>has been made to us repeatedly by MFA interlocutors.  The </p><p>Ambassador\'s continuing efforts to portray support for the </p><p>Cuban dissidents as an issue of principle is a hard one for </p><p>the Guatemalans to argue against, and is beginning to crack </p><p>Guatemalan determination to "pass us the bill" for </p><p>decertifying Guatemala.  We will continue to press this issue </p><p>publicly and privately on all fronts in the lead-up to the </p><p>vote. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
