SUMMARY:   ON OCTOBER 26, 2000, THE FOOD AND DRUG </p><p>ADMINISTRATION\'S CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE PROPOSED </p><p>WITHDRAWING ITS PREVIOUS APPROVAL FOR FLUOROQUINOLONES USED </p><p>THERAPEUTICALLY IN POULTRY.  THE FOLLOWING IS PROVIDED TO </p><p>ASSIST POSTS IN RESPONDING TO INQUIRIES FROM LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND PRESS.  AS NEEDED, POSTS MAY DRAW </p><p>ON TALKING POINTS PROVIDED IN PARA 12.  THIS IS NOT AN </p><p>ACTION REQUEST.  FDA\'S PROPOSAL AND RISK ASSESSMENT ARE </p><p>AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET, AS INDICATED BELOW.  IF HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT CONTACTS ARE INTERESTED IN ADDITIONAL </p><p>INFORMATION, THE FDA CONTACT PERSON IS: LINDA TOLLEFSON, </p><p>FDA/CVM, (301) 827-6647 OR LTOLLEFS@CVM.FDA.GOV.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FLUORQUINOLONE ANTIMICROBIAL DRUGS ARE USED IN </p><p>FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS TO TREAT, PREVENT AND CONTROL </p><p>DISEASE.  IN THE UNITED STATES, REGULATORY TERMINOLOGY </p><p>NAMES THESE PRODUCTS "NEW ANIMAL DRUGS."  (NOTE: WHILE USED </p><p>DIFFERENTLY BY SCIENTISTS, ANTIBIOTIC AND ANTIMICROBIAL ARE </p><p>USED INTERCHANGEABLY IN THIS DOCUMENT AND MEAN A PRODUCT </p><p>THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO INHIBIT BACTERIA.)  BEFORE ANY NEW </p><p>ANIMAL DRUG CAN BE APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES, THE </p><p>DRUG\'S SPONSOR MUST DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PRODUCT IS SAFE </p><p>AND EFFECTIVE FOR ITS INTENDED USE.  IF THE ANTIMICROBIAL </p><p>DRUG IS INTENDED FOR USE IN FOOD PRODUCING ANIMALS, THE </p><p>DRUG SPONSOR MUST DEMONSTRATE SAFETY FOR CONSUMERS OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        STATE   229699  041926Z </p><p>EDIBLE ANIMAL PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS SAFETY FOR USE IN THE </p><p>ANIMAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) FIRST CALLED FOR </p><p>SEVERAL RESTRICTIONS ON ANTIMICROBIAL USE IN FEED IN 1977. </p><p>IN RECENT YEARS, CONCERNS ABOUT THE USE OF ANTIMICROBIAL </p><p>PRODUCTS IN FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS HAVE FOCUSED ON HUMAN </p><p>FOOD SAFETY, BECAUSE FOODS OF ANIMAL ORIGIN ARE IDENTIFIED </p><p>AS VEHICLES OF FOODBORNE DISEASE IN HUMANS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SINCE 1988, FDA\'S CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE (CVM) </p><p>HAS APPROVED NEW THERAPEUTIC ANTIMICROBIALS AS </p><p>PRESCRIPTION-ONLY PRODUCTS FOR USE IN FOOD-PRODUCING </p><p>ANIMALS. THIS PRESCRIPTION-ONLY POLICY IS BASED ON THE NEED </p><p>TO ASSURE THE PROPER USE OF ANTIMICROBIALS THROUGH PRECISE </p><p>DIAGNOSIS AND CORRECT TREATMENT OF DISEASE TO MINIMIZE </p><p>ANIMAL SUFFERING AND TO AVOID DRUG RESIDUES IN FOOD. </p><p>ANTIMICROBIAL PRODUCTS FOR USE IN ANIMALS MUST MEET FDA\'S </p><p>STANDARDS FOR SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND QUALITY TO BE APPROVED </p><p>IN THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN THE 1990S, SEVERAL SCIENTISTS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>THE THERAPEUTIC USE OF FLUOROQUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS IN FOOD- </p><p>PRODUCING ANIMALS. THE SCIENTISTS SAID THE USE COULD LEAD </p><p>TO ENTERIC DISEASE IN HUMANS ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT FOODBORNE PATHOGENS. ADDING TO </p><p>THAT CONCERN WERE REPORTS OF A TEMPORAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN </p><p>THE APPROVAL OF FLUOROQUINOLONES FOR THERAPEUTIC USE IN </p><p>POULTRY IN EUROPE AND THE EMERGENCE OF A FLUOROQUINOLONE- </p><p>RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER FROM HUMANS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        STATE   229699  041926Z </p><p>6.  FLUOROQUINOLONES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST </p><p>VALUABLE ANTIMICROBIAL DRUG CLASSES AVAILABLE TO TREAT </p><p>HUMAN INFECTIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY, </p><p>SAFETY, AND EASE OF ADMINISTRATION.  THIS CLASS OF DRUGS IS </p><p>EFFECTIVE AGAINST A WIDE RANGE OF HUMAN DISEASES AND IS </p><p>USED BOTH IN TREATMENT AND PROPHYLAXIS OF BACTERIAL </p><p>INFECTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN HOSPITALS. </p><p>FLUOROQUINOLONES ARE USED ROUTINELY BY PHYSICIANS FOR THE </p><p>TREATMENT OF FOODBORNE DISEASE.  THESE DISEASES HAVE A </p><p>MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH CONSEQUENCE IN THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS </p><p>REGARDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FLUOROQUINOLONE USE IN </p><p>FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS, AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE 1987 </p><p>FDA REPORT (WHICH CONCLUDED THAT THERAPEUTIC ANTIMICROBIALS </p><p>USED FOR SHORT DURATION WERE SAFE) WAS STILL VALID, FDA </p><p>HELD A JOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING IN 1994 THAT </p><p>INCLUDED THE CVM VETERINARY MEDICINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE </p><p>(VMAC) AND THE CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH\'S </p><p>ANTI-INFECTIVE DRUGS ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  THE JOINT </p><p>COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED THAT FLUOROQUINOLONES FOR POULTRY BE </p><p>APPROVED, BUT THAT USE OF THE DRUGS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO </p><p>PRESCRIPTION ONLY, THAT NO EXTRA-LABEL USE SHOULD BE </p><p>ALLOWED, AND THAT RESISTANCE SHOULD BE MONITORED AFTER THE </p><p>PRODUCT WAS APPROVED.  APPROVAL OF BAYTRIL (TRADE NAME OF </p><p>ONE PRODUCT) WAS LIMITED TO THERAPEUTIC USE, PRESCRIPTION </p><p>ONLY, AND NO EXTRA-LABEL USE WAS ALLOWED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  FDA\'S CVM CREATED A FLUOROQUINOLONE WORKING GROUP TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE POINTS RAISED BY THE JOINT COMMITTEE. THE </p><p>WORKING GROUP OFFERED SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS, ALL OF WHICH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        STATE   229699  041926Z </p><p>WERE ACCEPTED BY CVM, AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE USE OF </p><p>FLUOROQUINOLONES WAS APPROVED FOR POULTRY IN 1995 AND 1996. </p><p>AS SUGGESTED IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS, THE SPONSORS AGREED TO </p><p>PROVIDE BASELINE SUSCEPTIBILITY INFORMATION AND TO CONDUCT </p><p>CONTINUING MONITORING OF TARGET ANIMAL PATHOGENS THROUGH </p><p>THE POST-APPROVAL MONITORING PROGRAM.  HOWEVER, RESISTANCE </p><p>DEVELOPED TO THE FLUOROQUINOLONES IN CAMPYLOBACTER, A MAJOR </p><p>FOODBORNE PATHOGEN IN HUMANS.  IN NOVEMBER 1998, THE FDA </p><p>ANNOUNCED DRAFT GUIDANCE FOR INDUSTRY ON THIS SUBJECT. </p><p>FINALIZED IN DECEMBER 1999, THIS STATED THAT THE FDA </p><p>BELIEVES IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL HUMAN </p><p>HEALTH IMPACT, WHEN APPROVING SUCH DRUGS, OF THE MICROBIAL </p><p>EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTINICROBIAL "NEW ANIMAL DRUGS" </p><p>INTENDED FOR USE IN FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE CENTER\'S CONCLUSIONS ARE BASED ON DATA FROM THE </p><p>NATIONAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE MONITORING SYSTEM (A </p><p>NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM OPERATED BY THE CENTER IN </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND </p><p>PREVENTION AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE), </p><p>PUBLISHED LITERATURE, AND OTHER SOURCES.  THE DATA INDICATE </p><p>THAT THE USE OF FLUOROQUINOLONES IN POULTRY IS A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT </p><p>CAMPYLOBACTER ON POULTRY CARCASSES, AND THEREFORE A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT </p><p>CAMPYLOBACTER INFECTIONS IN HUMANS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  ON OCTOBER 26, 2000, THE CVM ISSUED A "NOTICE OF </p><p>OPPORTUNITY" FOR A HEARING ON A PROPOSAL TO WITHDRAW THE </p><p>APPROVAL FOR USE OF ONE FLUOROQUINOLONE ANTIMICROBIAL IN </p><p>POULTRY.  THE OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL REGISTER PUBLISHED THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 06        STATE   229699  041926Z </p><p>NOTICE ON OCTOBER 31, 2000 (FEDERAL REGISTER VOLUME 65, </p><p>NUMBER 211, 64954).  IF A COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT SHOULD </p><p>BE ABLE TO KEEP ITS PRODUCT ON THE MARKET, IT CAN SEEK A </p><p>HEARING; THE REQUEST FOR A HEARING MUST BE MADE WITHIN 30 </p><p>DAYS AFTER THE NOTICE WAS PUBLISHED. TWO COMPANIES ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY PRODUCING FLUOROQUINOLONE ANTIMICROBIALS FOR </p><p>THERAPEUTIC USE IN POULTRY (SARAFLOXACIN AND ENROFLOXACIN). </p><p>ONE COMPANY, WHICH PRODUCES SARAFLOXACIN, HAS REQUESTED A </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF ITS APPROVAL AND THEREFORE WILL NOT SEEK A </p><p>HEARING.  THE OTHER COMPANY HAD NOT YET INDICATED IF IT </p><p>WILL REMOVE ITS PRODUCT FROM THE MARKET.  THE FDA DOCUMENT </p><p>IS AVAILABLE THROUGH FDA\'S DOCKETS MANAGEMENT BRANCH, AT </p><p>HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98FR/CV0076. PDF.  (NOTE: </p><p>MORE INFORMATION ON FDA AUTHORITY TO REMOVE PRODUCTS FROM </p><p>THE MARKET CAN BE FOUND AT: </p><p>HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/FDAC/FEATURES/895_RECALLS. HTML). </p><p> </p><p>11.  CONSISTENT WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS, THE </p><p>UNITED STATES NOTIFIED FDA\'S PROPOSAL TO THE WTO COMMITTEE </p><p>ON SANITARY AND PHYOSANITARY MEASURES ON NOVEMBER 3. </p><p>COMMENTS ARE DUE BY JANUARY 2, 2001. </p><p> </p><p>12. TALKING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>--      THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) HAS </p><p>PROPOSED WITHDRAWING APPROVAL FOR THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS </p><p>(ANTIMICROBIALS), SPECIFICALLY FLUOROQUINOLONES, USED </p><p>THERAPEUTICALLY IN POULTRY.  TWO COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY </p><p>PRODUCING FLUOROQUINOLONE ANTIMICROBIALS FOR THIS USE.  ONE </p><p>COMPANY HAS AGREED TO WITHDRAW THE PRODUCT VOLUNTARILY FROM </p><p>THE MARKET, WHILE THE OTHER COMPANY HAS YET TO ANNOUNCE ITS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 07        STATE   229699  041926Z </p><p>INTENTION. </p><p> </p><p>--      THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISK ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>ANTIMICROBIAL USE IN ANIMALS HAS BEEN DEBATED FOR OVER </p><p>THIRTY YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>--      BASED UPON EMERGING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT USES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE THERAPEUTIC USE OF ANTIMICROBIALS IN FOOD- </p><p>PRODUCING ANIMALS, MAY CAUSE BACTERIA TO DEVELOP RESISTANCE </p><p>TO THE USE OF THE SAME OR SIMILAR ANTIBIOTICS IN HUMANS, </p><p>THE FDA ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER 1998 DRAFT GUIDANCE FOR </p><p>INDUSTRY ON THIS SUBJECT.  FINALIZED IN DECEMBER 1999, THIS </p><p>STATED THAT FDA BELIEVES IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE </p><p>POTENTIAL HUMAN HEALTH IMPACT,  WHEN APPROVING SUCH DRUGS, </p><p>OF THE MICROBIAL EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIMICROBIAL "NEW </p><p>ANIMAL DRUGS" INTENDED FOR USE IN FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS. </p><p> </p><p>--      SINCE THE APPROVAL OF FLUOROQUINOLONES FOR THERAPEUTIC </p><p>USE IN FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS IN 1995 AND 1996, </p><p>SURVEILLANCE DATA HAVE IDENTIFIED A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN </p><p>THE APPROVAL OF FLUOROQUINOLONES FOR THERAPEUTIC USE IN </p><p>POULTRY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANCE </p><p>IN CAMPYLOBACTER IN ANIMALS AND HUMANS. </p><p> </p><p>--      FDA\'S RISK ASSESSMENT WAS INTENDED TO ESTIMATE THE RISK </p><p>TO HUMAN HEALTH FROM ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT FOODBORNE </p><p>PATHOGENS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOMESTIC USE OF </p><p>ANTIMICROBIALS IN FOOD PRODUCING ANIMALS.  SPECIFICALLY, A </p><p>MATHEMATICAL MODEL WAS DERIVED TO RELATE THE PREVALENCE OF </p><p>FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER INFECTIONS IN </p><p>HUMANS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSUMPTION OF CHICKEN TO THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 08        STATE   229699  041926Z </p><p>PREVALENCE OF FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER IN </p><p>CHICKENS. </p><p> </p><p>--      FDA STATES IN THE NOTICE OF ITS PROPOSAL PUBLISHED </p><p>OCTOBER 31, 2000 (FEDERAL REGISTER VOLUME 65, NUMBER 211, </p><p>64954) THAT IT BELIEVES: </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE USE OF FLUOROQUINOLONES IN POULTRY CAUSES THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF FLUOROQUINOLONE- RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER, A </p><p>PATHOGEN TO HUMANS, IN POULTRY; </p><p> </p><p>2.  THIS FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER IS </p><p>TRANSFERRED TO HUMANS AND IS A SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER </p><p>INFECTIONS IN HUMANS; AND </p><p> </p><p>3.  FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER INFECTIONS ARE </p><p>A HAZARD TO HUMAN HEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>--      FOR MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON THE RISK ASSESSMENT, </p><p>IT CAN BE FOUND ON FDA\'S WEB SITE AT: </p><p>HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/CVM/FDA/MAPPGS/ANTITOC.HTM L </p><p> </p><p>--      THUS, FDA IS PROPOSING TO WITHDRAW THE APPROVAL FOR USE </p><p>OF ENROFLOXACIN, ONE FLUOROQUINOLONE, IN POULTRY ON THE </p><p>GROUNDS THAT NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS THE PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>SHOWN TO BE SAFE. </p><p> </p><p>--      THE COMPANY PRODUCING ANOTHER FLUOROQUINOLONE FOR USE </p><p>IN POULTRY, SARAFLOXACIN, PLANS TO WITHDRAW THE PRODUCT </p><p>FROM THE MARKET. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 09        STATE   229699  041926Z </p><p> </p><p>--      THE UNITED STATES NOTIFIED FDA\'S PROPOSAL TO THE WTO </p><p>COMMITTEE ON SANITARY AND PHYOSANITARY MEASURES ON NOVEMBER </p><p>3, AS CALLED FOR UNDER INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.  COMMENTS </p><p>ARE DUE BY JANUARY 2, 2001. </p><p> </p><p>(IF ASKED) </p><p> </p><p>--      IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS STAGE IF THIS WILL AFFECT POULTRY </p><p>PRODUCTS EXPORTED TO THE UNITED STATES.  THE FOOD SAFETY </p><p>AND INSPECTION SERVICE IS EXAMINING THE FDA ACTION TO </p><p>DETERMINE HOW POULTRY IMPORTS FROM COUNTRIES USING </p><p>FLUOROQUINOLONES WILL BE HANDLED. </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p></div>
