<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 000927 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE OPPOSITION FILES LEGAL CHALLENGE TO </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 913 </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Political Officer Todd Faulk for reasons: </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On April 12, the opposition Movement for </p><p>Democratic Change (MDC) filed with the High Court a 135- </p><p>page legal challenge to President Mugabe\'s declared </p><p>victory in the March presidential poll.  The filing was </p><p>made just before the 30-day deadline to submit electoral </p><p>challenges elapsed.  The lawsuit calls for an annulment </p><p>of the election result and a new election under </p><p>international supervision.  In an April 11 press </p><p>statement, MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai stated that </p><p>the election "was stolen from the people of Zimbabwe," </p><p>and that the MDC sees "the legal process as </p><p>complementing the political process."  "Our lawyers have </p><p>uncovered mountains of hardcore and powerful evidence of </p><p>electoral fraud," Tsvangirai claimed, but he clearly </p><p>acknowledged that the legal case\'s biggest hurdle is </p><p>overcoming the judicial system subverted by the ruling </p><p>party. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On April 15, poloff spoke to Topper Whitehead, </p><p>who gathered most of the information presented in the </p><p>legal challenge.  He is an MDC supporter, but holds no </p><p>official position in the party.  Whitehead stated that </p><p>President Mugabe, along with Registrar-General Tobaiwa </p><p>Mudede, Minister of Justice Patrick Chinamasa, and </p><p>Electoral Supervisory Chairman Sobusa Gula-Ndebele, are </p><p>respondents in the case.  All have been served with </p><p>papers to appear in court, except Mugabe, whose office </p><p>refuses to accept them; there are ways around this, </p><p>Whitehead said, but it would lead to delays in the court </p><p>hearing the case.  Whitehead conveyed that the MDC is </p><p>gathering affidavits from polling agents, presiding </p><p>officers and voters who can attest to instances of </p><p>electoral fraud.  Thousands of pages of documentation </p><p>and videotape from hundreds of eyewitnesses have already </p><p>been gathered.  One of the reasons the MDC is going to </p><p>court over the election, Whitehead opined, is to provide </p><p>leverage in the talks with ZANU-PF due to reconvene on </p><p>May 13 (REFTEL).  The MDC would like to have the option </p><p>of dropping the case if the talks lead to some sort of </p><p>resolution. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In a related development, Whitehead informed </p><p>poloff that last week the Supreme Court ruled against an </p><p>earlier MDC legal measure challenging the validity of </p><p>Section 158 of the Electoral Act, which gives Mugabe the </p><p>power to issue decrees regarding the conduct of </p><p>elections.  It was a 4-to-1 decision in which Wilson </p><p>Sandura was the only dissenter.  A copy of the decision </p><p>has not been made available to the MDC yet, Whitehead </p><p>added, but the Court basically ruled that the issue was </p><p>not a constitutional one and should be heard in the High </p><p>Court first.  As a result, the Section 158 challenge has </p><p>now been incorporated into the MDC\'s latest lawsuit. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment: We have been told by several MDC </p><p>officials that the MDC has no hope of success in its </p><p>legal challenge of the election but that it wants to </p><p>pursue all possible avenues and be seen as taking some </p><p>kind of action.  It is also a useful bargaining chip in </p><p>the inter-party talks -- one of the few the opposition </p><p>has left.  It is too early to tell how the case will </p><p>proceed in the courts, but experience suggests ZANU-PF </p><p>will use its influence to ensure the courts drag out the </p><p>proceedings -- and consume the MDC\'s resources -- before </p><p>ultimately throwing the case out.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Whitehead </p><p></p></div>
