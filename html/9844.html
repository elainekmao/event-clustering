SECSTATE 205815 </p><p> </p><p>     B. THE HAGUE 1603 </p><p>     C. TD-314/33365-03 JUN 27 03 </p><p>     D. TD-314/02218-03 JAN 16 03 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/PolCouns Nathaniel Dean Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) To date, only one political group in the Netherlands </p><p>claims an Islamic political platform (AEL-NL, see A below). </p><p>There are numerous Islamic based organizations and student </p><p>groups, most of which are small in number and influence. </p><p>With the exception of AEL-NL, Islamic organizations are </p><p>normally interested solely in domestic issues that affect </p><p>their members, such as integration and immigration policies, </p><p>and freedom of religion and speech concerns. </p><p> </p><p>Answers below are keyed to ref A questions as appropriate: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Arab European League Netherlands (AEL Nederland or AEL-NL) </p><p>-Assessment of AEL-NL per reftel: willing to engage in a </p><p>democratic, pluralistic process but if given full power, </p><p>would not respect the rights of non-Islamists, secularists, </p><p>and/or minorities.  (Note:  There is no/no chance of AEL-NL </p><p>gaining full power in the Netherlands.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>-AEL-NL is a young organization that aspires to become a </p><p>political party and activist Islamic movement.  AEL-NL was </p><p>formed in early 2003 as a branch of AEL, a Belgian </p><p>organization. </p><p> </p><p>--Support for AEL Nederland is minimal.  It claims </p><p>approximately 800 members, primarily young second-generation </p><p>Moroccans. Support is centered in metropolitan areas where </p><p>such individuals reside (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, </p><p>Eindhoven). </p><p> </p><p>--Agenda is domestic in nature, but it maintains a fierce </p><p>anti-Israel stance.  Members must be either Arab or Muslim. </p><p> </p><p>--N/A </p><p> </p><p>--N/A </p><p> </p><p>--While presenting itself as a democratic and moderate </p><p>Islamic party, AEL-NL is viewed locally as an extremist </p><p>group. To date Post is unaware of an active intra-islamic </p><p>debate between AEL-NL and other Islamic groups in country. </p><p> </p><p>--No.  The group does not show any willingness to cooperate </p><p>politically with non-Islamic groups; it strongly opposes such </p><p>interaction. </p><p> </p><p>--AEL-NL is, in general, more anti-Western than anti-American. </p><p> </p><p>B.  Islam and Citizenship (Islaam en Burgerschap) (IEB) </p><p> </p><p>--Assessment of Islam and Citizenship per reftel:  Group </p><p>which engages in a democratic, pluralistic process and </p><p>does/would respect the rights of others as well as the </p><p>principles of alternance of government. </p><p> </p><p>--IEB is an umbrella group for Islamic groups (including </p><p>Turkish, Moroccan and Surinamese) in the Netherlands.  IEB </p><p>works as an intermediary between the Dutch government and </p><p>such groups.  Its member organizations are concerned with </p><p>domestic issues. </p><p> </p><p>--In general, the member organizations of this umbrella group </p><p>view the Shari\'ah as an elastic body of guidance able to </p><p>evolve to fit contemporary circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>--N/A </p><p> </p><p>--IEB is at the forefront of facilitating intra-islamic </p><p>debate between the Turkish, Moroccan, and Surinamese Islamic </p><p>groups in country. </p><p> </p><p>--Yes. </p><p> </p><p>--IEB and its member organizations work closely with the </p><p>Embassy and are sympathetic to U.S. and western societies. </p><p> </p><p>--Note:  Member groups are comprised of:  Islamic Center </p><p>Netherlands (Islamitisch Centrum Nederland); Islamic </p><p>Foundation Netherlands (Islamitische Stichting Nederland); </p><p>Milli Gorus Northern Netherlands (Milli Gorus Noord </p><p>Nederland); Dutch Islamic Federation (Nederlandse </p><p>Islamitische Federatie); Dutch Muslim Council (Nederlandse </p><p>Moslim Raad);  Foundation for the Promotion of Arabic and </p><p>Turkish Women and Families (St. Promotie door Arabische en </p><p>Turkse Vrouwen en Gezinnen); Foundation of Dutch Muslim Woman </p><p>(St. Nederlandse moslimvrouwen); Turkish Islamic Cultural </p><p>Federation (Turks-Islamitisch Culturele Federatie); Union of </p><p>Moroccan Muslim Organizations in the Netherlands (Unie van </p><p>Marokkaanse Moslim Organisaties in Nederland); Council of </p><p>Mosques (Raad van Moskeeen); Foundation Hague Islamic </p><p>Platform (Stichting Haags Islamitisch Platform); Foundation </p><p>Platform Islamic Organizations Rijmond (Stichting Platform </p><p>Islamitische Organisaties Rijnmond); Brabant Islamic Council </p><p>(Brabantse Islamitische Raad). </p><p> </p><p>2.
