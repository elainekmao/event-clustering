CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY  DURING A RECENT MEETING, A LATIN </p><p>AMERICAN DIPLOMAT AND HIS WIFE PROVIDED POLOFF AN </p><p>ACCOUNT OF THEIR MOVEMENTS ON JUNE 3-4 AND THEIR </p><p>EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF EVENTS AT TIANANMEN SQUARE. </p><p>ALTHOUGH THEIR ACCOUNT GENERALLY FOLLOWS THOSE </p><p>PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THEIR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES PROVIDE </p><p>ADDITIONAL INSIGHT AND CORROBORATION OF EVENTS IN THE </p><p>SQUARE.  THEY WERE ABLE TO ENTER AND LEAVE THE SQUARE </p><p>SEVERAL TIMES AND WERE NOT HARASSED BY TROOPS. </p><p>REMAINING WITH STUDENTS BY THE MONUMENT TO THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S HEROES UNTIL THE FINAL WITHDRAWAL, THE </p><p>DIPLOMAT SAID THERE WERE NO MASS SHOOTINGS OF </p><p>STUDENTS IN THE SQUARE OR AT THE MONUMENT.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DURING A RECENT MEETING, CHILEAN SECOND SECRETARY </p><p>CARLOS GALLO AND HIS WIFE (PLEASE PROTECT) PROVIDED </p><p>POLOFF AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR MOVEMENTS ON JUNE 3-4 AND </p><p>THEIR EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF EVENTS AT TIANANMEN </p><p>SQUARE.  ALTHOUGH THE GALLO\'S ACCOUNT GENERALLY </p><p>FOLLOWS THOSE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THEIR UNIQUE </p><p>EXPERIENCES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSIGHT AND </p><p>CORROBORATION OF EVENTS IN THE SQUARE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  GALLO SAID THEIR EVENING BEGAN AROUND 2100 HOURS </p><p>WHEN THEY FIRST HEARD THAT TROOPS WERE ENTERING THE </p><p>CITY.  THE CHILEAN AMBASSADOR WAS HAVING DINNER AT </p><p>THE DRAGON SPRING MOVENPICK HOTEL IN FAR WESTERN </p><p>BEIJING; THE GALLOS WERE DISPATCHED IN THEIR OWN CAR </p><p>TO ALERT THE AMBASSADOR AND BRING HIM HOME.  TAKING A </p><p>CIRCUITOUS ROUTE NORTH OF THE CITY, THEY DID NOT SEE </p><p>MUCH EVIDENCE OF THE VIOLENT EVENTS TO COME UNTIL </p><p>THEY REACHED WESTERN BEIJING ON THE ROAD TO THE </p><p>MOVENPICK HOTEL.  THE ROAD WAS FILLED FIVE ABREAST </p><p>WITH MILITARY VEHICLES INCLUDING TANKS, APCS, AND </p><p>TRUCKS FILLED WITH TROOPS HEADING INTO THE CITY. </p><p>ONCE THE GALLOS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS DIPLOMATS, </p><p>THE COUPLE WAS ALLOWED TO INCH ALONG THE SHOULDER OF </p><p>THE ROAD; MRS. GALLO DROVE WHILE HER HUSBAND WALKED </p><p>AHEAD OF THE CAR ASKING THE MILITARY VEHICLES TO MAKE </p><p>SOME ROOM FOR THEIR CAR.  THEY REACHED THEIR </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND MADE THEIR WAY BACK TO THEIR EMBASSY </p><p>IN THE SANLITUN DIPLOMATIC AREA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE SQUARE, </p><p>THE GALLOS, AGAIN IN THEIR OWN CAR, DROVE TOWARDS </p><p>TIANANMEN.  ALTHOUGH THEY ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL </p><p>CIVILIAN MANNED BARRICADES AND PEOPLE WARNED THEM NOT </p><p>TO GO ANY FURTHER AS THE ARMY WAS COMING, THEY WERE </p><p>ALLOWED TO PROCEED.  THEY EVENTUALLY PARKED THEIR CAR </p><p>JUST TO THE EAST OF THE MUSEUM OF THE CHINESE </p><p>REVOLUTION AND WALKED TO THE SQUARE VIA AN ALLEY JUST </p><p>SOUTH OF THE MUSEUM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE GALLOS POSITIONED THEMSELVES NEAR THE RED </p><p>CROSS STATION AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS TO THE </p><p>MUSEUM.  INITIALLY NOT MUCH WAS HAPPENING IN THE </p><p>SQUARE AS MOST OF THE FIGHTING WAS TAKING PLACE TO </p><p>THE WEST.  BODIES AND WOUNDED, HOWEVER, BEGAN TO </p><p>ARRIVE AT THE RED CROSS STATION INDICATING THE EXTENT </p><p>OF THE FIGHTING AND THE FACT THAT REAL BULLETS WERE </p><p>BEING USED.  AS THE MILITARY BEGAN TO REACH THE </p><p>OUTSKIRTS OF THE SQUARE AND SHOTS WERE FIRED IN THE </p><p>VICINITY OF THE RED CROSS STATION, MRS. GALLO DECIDED </p><p>SHE WANTED TO LEAVE.  THE GALLOS MADE THEIR WAY BACK </p><p>TO THEIR CAR AND DROVE BACK TO THEIR APARTMENT IN </p><p>SANLITUN.  GALLO DROPPED OFF HIS WIFE AND DROVE BACK </p><p>TO THE SQUARE, AGAIN PARKING EAST OF THE MUSEUM. </p><p> </p><p>7.  CONTRARY TO THE EXPERIENCES OF MOST AMERICANS ON </p><p>THE SQUARE, GALLO SAID THAT HE ESSENTIALLY WAS </p><p>ALLOWED FREE PASSAGE AROUND THE SQUARE, EVEN WHEN </p><p>SIGHTED BY TROOPS.  HE SAID AT ONE POINT HE WAS </p><p>STANDING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF CHANGAN JIE, JUST WEST </p><p>OF THE SQUARE, WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF TO THE REAR OF </p><p>TROOPS ENTERING THE SQUARE FROM THE WEST.  HE SAID </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE WAS SEEN, THE TROOPS PAID NO ATTENTION TO </p><p>HIM AND HE EVENTUALLY PASSED BACK AND FORTH ACROSS </p><p>TROOP LINES A COUPLE OF TIMES.  ANOTHER CHILEAN </p><p>DIPLOMAT WHO STAYED AROUND XINHUAMEN AT ZHONGNANHAI </p><p>HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE.  GALLO GUESSED THAT SINCE </p><p>MOST OF THE TROOPS WERE FROM THE PROVINCES AND DID </p><p>NOT USUALLY DEAL WITH FOREIGNERS, THEY FOLLOWED THE </p><p>GENERAL PRACTICE OF LEAVING FOREIGNERS ALONE.  HE </p><p>ALSO NOTED THAT HE WAS NOT CARRYING A CAMERA. </p><p> </p><p>8.  GALLO EVENTUALLY ENDED UP AT THE RED CROSS </p><p>STATION, AGAIN HOPING THAT TROOPS WOULD NOT FIRE ON </p><p>THE MEDICAL PERSONNEL THERE.  HE WATCHED THE MILITARY </p><p>ENTER THE SQUARE AND DID NOT OBSERVE ANY MASS FIRING </p><p>OF WEAPONS INTO THE CROWDS, ALTHOUGH SPORADIC GUNFIRE </p><p>WAS HEARD.  HE SAID THAT MOST OF THE TROOPS WHICH </p><p>ENTERED THE SQUARE WERE ACTUALLY ARMED ONLY WITH </p><p>ANTI-RIOT GEAR--TRUNCHEONS AND WOODEN CLUBS; THEY </p><p>WERE BACKED UP BY ARMED SOLDIERS.  AS THE MILITARY </p><p>CONSOLIDATED ITS CONTROL OF THE SQUARE\'S PERIMETER, </p><p>STUDENTS AND CIVILIANS GATHERED AROUND THE MONUMENT </p><p>TO THE PEOPLE\'S HEROES.  GALLO SAID WOUNDED, </p><p>INCLUDING SOME SOLDIERS, CONTINUED TO BE BROUGHT TO </p><p>THE RED CROSS STATION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE TROOPS BEGAN A SLOW ORDERLY APPROACH TO THE </p><p>MONUMENT FROM THE NORTH WITH SOLDIERS ON FOOT </p><p>PRECEEDING APCS.  FROM WHAT HE COULD SEE, GALLO FELT </p><p>THAT MOST OF THE TENTS ON THE SQUARE WERE EMPTY WHEN </p><p>THE ARMORED VEHICLES ROLLED OVER THEM.  THE FIRST </p><p>LINE OF TROOPS TO REACH THE MONUMENT AREA, PASSED BY </p><p>THE RED CROSS STATION AND IGNORED THE MEDICAL </p><p>PERSONNEL AND WOUNDED.  AS A SECOND LINE OF TROOPS </p><p>APPROACHED, THEY CIRCLED THE RED CROSS STATION AND </p><p>BEGAN YELLING AND THROWING STICKS AND DEBRIS OVER THE </p><p>HEADS OF THE PEOPLE AT THE STATION.  THE MEDICAL </p><p>PERSONNEL PANICKED AND FLED, LEAVING BEHIND THE </p><p>WOUNDED.  MOST PEOPLE, INCLUDING GALLO, FLED TO THE </p><p>MONUMENT AREA WHERE THE STUDENTS WERE GATHERED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  ALTHOUGH GUNFIRE COULD BE HEARD, GALLO SAID THAT </p><p>APART FROM SOME BEATING OF STUDENTS, THERE WAS NO </p><p>MASS FIRING INTO THE CROWD OF STUDENTS AT THE </p><p>MONUMENT.  WHEN POLOFF MENTIONED SOME REPORTEDLY </p><p>EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF MASSACRES AT THE MONUMENT WITH </p><p>AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, GALLO SAID THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH </p><p>SLAUGHTER.  ONCE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED FOR THE </p><p>STUDENTS TO WITHDRAW, LINKING HANDS TO FORM A COLUMN, </p><p>THE STUDENTS LEFT THE SQUARE THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST </p><p>CORNER.  ESSENTIALLY EVERYONE, INCLUDING GALLO, </p><p>LEFT.  THE FEW THAT ATTEMPTED TO REMAIN BEHIND WERE </p><p>BEATEN AND DRIVEN TO JOIN THE END OF THE DEPARTING </p><p>PROCESSION.  ONCE OUTSIDE THE SQUARE, THE STUDENTS </p><p>HEADED WEST ON QIANMEN DAJIE WHILE GALLO HEADED EAST </p><p>TO HIS CAR.  THEREFORE, HE COULD NOT COMMENT ON </p><p>REPORTS THAT STUDENTS WERE AMBUSHED AND SLAUGHTERED </p><p>IN THE ALLEY JUST WEST OF THE SQUARE NEAR THE BEIJING </p><p>CONCERT HALL. </p><p> </p><p>11.  LATER THE MORNING OF JUNE 4, GALLO AND HIS WIFE </p><p>MADE THEIR WAY BACK TO THE SQUARE, AGAIN VIA THE </p><p>ALLEY TO THE SOUTH OF THE MUSEUM OF THE REVOLUTION. </p><p>HE SAID THAT FOR NO APPARENT REASON THAT ALLEY WAS </p><p>THE ONLY ONE NOT SEALED OFF.  FROM THE ALLEY THEY SAW </p><p>TROOPS CLEARING THE SQUARE PILING UP LARGE PLASTIC </p><p>BAGS AND DRAGGING THEM TO HELICOPTERS.  THEY COULD </p><p>NOT COMMENT ON WHETHER THE BAGS CONTAINED REFUSE OR </p><p>BODIES.  AT THE TIME, THEY SAID, THEY COULD NOT </p><p>IMAGINE THE BAGS CONTAINED BODIES AND HAD ASSUMED IT </p><p>WAS GARBAGE.  ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT ACTUALLY WITNESS </p><p>ANY LARGE SCALE SHOOTINGS ON THE SQUARE PROPER, GALLO </p><p>SAW MANY CASUALTIES BROUGHT INTO THE SQUARE AND DID </p><p>NOT DOUBT THAT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN BEIJING WERE </p><p>KILLED BY THE ARMY ON JUNE 3 AND 4.  HE SAID THAT A </p><p>SPANISH TELEVISION CREW MIGHT HAVE FOOTAGE OF THE </p><p>REPORTED MASSACRE AT THE BEIJING CONCERT HALL AND </p><p>THAT THE SPANISH AMBASSADOR WOULD BE HOLDING A </p><p>SCREENING FOR OTHER AMBASSADORS WHEN HE RECEIVED A </p><p>GOOD COPY.  APPARENTLY AN EARLIER VERSION OF THE TAPE </p><p>HAD BEEN BADLY BUTCHERED BY EDITORS IN SPAIN WHO HAD </p><p>SPLICED TOGETHER PIECES OF THE VIDEO IN THE WRONG </p><p>SEQUENCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LILLEY </p><p></p></div>
