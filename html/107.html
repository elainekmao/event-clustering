<p>S E C R E T LONDON 01567 </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  UG, PGOV, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE UGANDA SITUATION: LONDON VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 19968 </p><p> </p><p>1. SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. OUR FCO COLLEAGUES ARE WATCHING THE UGANDA SITUATION </p><p>WITH GROWING CONCERN, AND THEIR ANALYSIS OF MUSEVENI\'S </p><p>NEGATIVE ROLE VERY MUCH COINCIDES WITH OUR OWN IN </p><p>REFTEL.  THE FCO WAS THOROUGHLY RATTLED BY THE FIGHTING </p><p>IN KAMPALA ON WEDNESDAY MORNING; HOWEVER, THE BRITISH </p><p>WERE SLIGHTLY CHEERED WHEN THE KENYANS INFORMED THEM </p><p>THAT MOI WILL BE MEETING WITH THE NRA IN NAIROBI ON </p><p>FRIDAY TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. ON THE BRITISH MILITARY ROLE, WE WERE TOLD THAT THE </p><p>OPERATION IS TOTALLY ON HOLD PENDING FURTHER </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS.  THE BRITISH MAJOR GENERAL WHO WOULD HEAD </p><p>THE MILITARY GROUP REMAINS IN NAIROBI. </p><p> </p><p>4. LONRHO CHIEF EXECUTIVE TINY ROWLAND TODAY TOLD US </p><p>THAT MUSEVENI\'S GAME PLAN ON UGANDA REMAINS UNCHANGED. </p><p>ACCORDING TO ROWLAND, MUSEVENI WANTS TO EDGE HIS WAY </p><p>TOWARD POLITICAL DOMINANCE IN THE COUNTRY; HE IS UTTERLY </p><p>CONTEMPTUOUS OF OKELLO, ETC; HE VIEWS THE NAIROBI ACCORD </p><p>SIMPLY AS A REVISED FORMAT FOR CONTINUED POLITICAL </p><p>CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>5. ASKED WHETHER MUSEVENI PLANS TO TAKE KAMPALA, ROWLAND </p><p>REPLIED THAT MUSEVENI HAS CONSISTENTLY TOLD HIM HE CAN </p><p>TAKE KAMPALA BUT CANNOT HOLD IT.  THEREFORE, HE WILL NOT </p><p>ACTUALLY MOVE INTO THE CITY.  THE FCO AGREES, BELIEVING </p><p>THAT MUSEVENI WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE TACTIC OF PUTTING </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE CITY AND THEN RELENTING. </p><p> </p><p>6. PRESS REPORTS HERE CONTINUE TO ALLEGE THAT AN </p><p>INCURSION BY ZAIRE FORCES INTO SOUTHWESTERN UGANDA HAS </p><p>OCCURRED IN COOPERATION WITH FORMER AMIN TROOPS.  OUR </p><p>FCO CONTACTS SAY THEY ARE UNABLE TO CONFIRM THAT STORY. </p><p>HOWEVER, "SOUTH" MAGAZINE CORRESPONDENT WILLIAM PIKE </p><p>TELLS US THE REPORTS - ACCORDING TO HIS NRA FRIENDS - </p><p>ARE CORRECT, AND THE OPERATION IS DESIGNED TO FORESTALL </p><p>NRA MOVES AGAINST KAMPALA.  (IF SO, IT WOULD APPARENTLY </p><p>INDICATE AN ABOUT-FACE BY MOBUTU ON THE UGANDAN </p><p>SITUATION.) </p><p> </p><p>7. WE PLAN TO PURSUE THESE ISSUES IN OUR FRIDAY MEETING </p><p>WITH BEN MOTOGO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PRICE </p><p></p></div>
