<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001835 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IT, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: PM BERLUSCONI\'S FORMER LAWYER CONVICTED OF BRIBING </p><p>JUDGES </p><p> </p><p>REF: REF 0355 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>    1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  FORMER BERLUSCONI LAWYER CESARE PREVITI </p><p>WAS CONVICTED ON APRIL 29 OF BRIBING JUDGES IN TWO CORPORATE </p><p>TAKEOVER BATTLES.  HE WILL APPEAL THE SENTENCE.  THE VERDICT </p><p>IS EMBARRASSING FOR THE PM BECAUSE OF PREVITI,S </p><p>LONG-STANDING ASSOCIATION WITH BERLUSCONI, BUT WILL NOT SHAKE </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT,S STABILITY.  MORE SERIOUS IS AN ONGOING </p><p>TRIAL THAT DIRECTLY INVOLVES BERLUSCONI, WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED </p><p>OF HAVING FUNNELED MONEY TO A JUDGE TO INFLUENCE HIS DECISION </p><p>ON ANOTHER CORPORATE TAKEOVER MATTER.  THE VERDICT COULD BE </p><p>ISSUED IN JULY WHEN ITALY WILL HOLD THE ROTATING EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER CESARE PREVITI, FORZA ITALIA </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIAN AS WELL AS ONE OF PM SILVIO BERLUSCONI\'S </p><p>FORMER LAWYERS, WAS CONVICTED ON APRIL 29 IN A MILAN COURT </p><p>FOR HAVING BRIBED JUDGES.  HE WAS SENTENCED TO 11 YEARS IN </p><p>PRISON.  PREVITI SAID HE WOULD APPEAL THE SENTENCE, WHICH </p><p>STEMS FROM HIS INVOLVEMENT IN TWO LONG-RUNNING TRIALS*DUBBED </p><p>IMI-SIR AND LODO (AWARD) MONDADORI.  LAST JANUARY, THE MILAN </p><p>TRIBUNAL DECIDED TO COMBINE THE TWO INTO A SINGLE TRIAL AS </p><p>MANY OF THE ACCUSED WERE INVOLVED IN BOTH. </p><p> </p><p>3. IN THE IMI-SIR CASE, PREVITI WAS CHARGED WITH THE CRIME OF </p><p>CORRUPTING (THROUGH BRIBERY) JUDGES TO FIX A COURT RULING IN </p><p>FAVOR OF THE ROVELLI FAMILY.  THE ROVELLIS WERE DISPUTING THE </p><p>TERMS OF A TAKEOVER BY THE PUBLICLY-OWNED ITALIAN REAL ESTATE </p><p>INSTITUTE (IMI) OF THEIR FIRM, THE ITALIAN RESIN COMPANY </p><p>(SIR). ACCORDING TO THE PROSECUTION, PREVITI AND TWO OTHER </p><p>LAWYERS RECEIVED THE EQUIVALENT OF EUROS 33 MILLION IN THE </p><p>EARLY 1990S FROM OILMAN NINO ROVELLI\'S HEIRS IN ORDER TO </p><p>BRIBE THREE JUDGES, WHO AWARDED THE HEIRS A LUCRATIVE </p><p>    SETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN THE SECOND CASE, PREVITI WAS CHARGED WITH BRIBING A </p><p>JUDGE IN 1991 SO THAT PM BERLUSCONI,S FININVEST HOLDING </p><p>COMPANY COULD WIN CONTROL OF MONDADORI, ITALY\'S LARGEST </p><p>PUBLISHING COMPANY. AT THE TIME, PREVITI WAS WORKING AS A </p><p>LAWYER FOR BERLUSCONI. THE OWNER OF MONDADORI HAD AGREED TO </p><p>SELL THE FIRM TO INDUSTRIALIST, PUBLISHER, AND BERLUSCONI </p><p>RIVAL CARLO DE BENEDETTI UNTIL FININVEST STEPPED IN WITH A </p><p>BETTER OFFER.  DE BENEDETTI SUED IN COURT FOR BREACH OF </p><p>CONTRACT, BUT THE DECIDING JUDGE--ACCUSED LATER OF ACCEPTING </p><p>A BRIBE--RULED IN FAVOR OF FININVEST. BERLUSCONI IN 1997 WAS </p><p>ALSO INDICTED FOR CORRUPTION IN THE MONDADORI CASE, BUT THE </p><p>STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR HIS ALLEGED LESSER CRIME RAN OUT </p><p>DURING THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE APRIL 29 VERDICT, ALTHOUGH EMBARRASSING FOR </p><p>BERLUSCONI DUE TO HIS CLOSE AFFILIATION WITH PREVITI, WILL </p><p>HAVE NO DIRECT IMPACT ON THE GOI,S STABILITY. BERLUSCONI, </p><p>WHO HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN IN HIS CRITICISM OF THE RULING MILAN </p><p>COURT FOR ITS ALLEGED POLITICIZATION, IMMEDIATELY ISSUED A </p><p>COMMUNIQUE EXPRESSING HIS PERSONAL SOLIDARITY AND THAT OF HIS </p><p>PARTY, FORZA ITALIA, WITH PREVITI.  HE SAID THE VERDICT </p><p>CONFIRMED HIS SUSPICIONS OF A &POLITICAL PROSECUTION.8  THE </p><p>CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION, WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO </p><p>UNLEASH A BARRAGE OF CRITICISM AT THE PM IN THE WAKE OF THE </p><p>VERDICT, HAS INSTEAD DECIDED TO TAKE A LOW KEY APPROACH.  IT </p><p>IS PROBABLY CALCULATING THAT THE PRESS HAS DONE A SUFFICIENT </p><p>JOB OF DRAWING OUT THE PREVITI-BERLUSCONI CONNECTION FOR THE </p><p>PUBLIC.  MOREOVER, THE DEEPLY DIVIDED AND LEADERLESS </p><p>OPPOSITION HAS NO INTEREST IN PROVOKING A GOVERNMENT CRISIS </p><p>    THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO NEW ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) BERLUSCONI, WE WANT TO UNDERSCORE, IS NOT OUT OF </p><p>THE JUDICIAL WOODS.  HE IS ON TRIAL IN YET ANOTHER JUDGE </p><p>BRIBERY CASE FOR ALLEGEDLY DELIVERING CASH PAYMENTS IN ORDER </p><p>TO INFLUENCE A RULING ON THE PRIVATIZATION OF A FORMERLY </p><p>STATE-OWNED FOOD CONGLOMERATE (SME).  DE BENEDETTI, ALSO A </p><p>PROTAGONIST IN THE SME CASE, HAD IN 1985 BEEN GIVEN THE </p><p>RIGHTS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANY.  HOWEVER,  FORMER PREMIER </p><p>BETTINO CRAXI--WHO HAD CLOSE TIES TO BERLUSCONI--INTERVENED </p><p>TO BLOCK THE SALE IN FAVOR OF A RIVAL FININVEST BID. DE </p><p>BENEDETTI RESORTED TO THE COURTS, BUT LOST, AND BRIBERY </p><p>CHARGES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY BROUGHT AGAINST BERLUSCONI BY </p><p>INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATES. BERLUSCONI MAY MAKE A STATEMENT IN </p><p>MILAN AT THE SME TRIAL ON MAY 2. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) PRESS REPORTS INDICATE THAT A RULING IN THE SME </p><p>CASE COULD BE HANDED DOWN IN JULY, JUST AS ITALY IS BEGINNING </p><p>ITS SIX-MONTH EU PRESIDENCY TERM.  ITALIAN MAGISTRATES CLAIM </p><p>THAT THEIR RULINGS ARE COMPLETELY DEVOID OF POLITICS, AND THE </p><p>OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THEM MAY WELL BE.  HOWEVER, THERE IS </p><p>A CURIOUS HISTORY OF RENDERING DECISIONS THAT AFFECT </p><p>BERLUSCONI AT MOMENTS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY INOPPORTUNE FOR </p><p>HIM.  SEPTEL WILL ANALYZE THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF A </p><p>CONVICTION AND EFFORTS BY THE GOI TO AMELIORATE THE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOTE: PLS SERVICE FOR INVALID REF </p><p> </p><p>ROME 00001835  001.2 OF 002 </p><p> </p><p>BING JUDGES IN TWO CORPORATE </p><p>TAKEOVER BATTLES.
