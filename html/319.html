SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT GUSTAVO CEDENO </p><p>(STRICTLY PROTECT), WAS ARRESTED BY REGIME </p><p>AUTHORITIES ON DECEMBER 5, DETAINED FOR 21 HOURS, </p><p>BEATEN, AND QUESTIONED ABOUT A POSSIBLE NEW COUP </p><p>ATTEMPT.  HE WAS FORCED TO SIGN STATEMENTS AGAINST </p><p>THE CHURCH AND CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDC) </p><p>PRESIDENT RICARDO ARIAS CALDERON, AND WAS </p><p>REPORTEDLY ENLISTED TO SPY ON THE OPPOSITION </p><p>BEFORE BEING RELEASED.  CEDENO HAS SOUGHT REFUGE </p><p>AT A U.S. MILITARY FACILITY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  CEDENO, A CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC RATY ACTIVIST, </p><p>MET WITH POLOFF ON DECEMBER 9 TO REPORT HIS ORDEAL </p><p>AND DISPLAY HIS BRUISES (CEDENO COULD BARELY WALK </p><p>AND HAS SINCE SOUGHT REFUGE ON A U.S. BASE.) </p><p>ACCORDING TO CEDENO, ON DEC. 5, TWELVE ARMED MEN </p><p>TOOK HIM FROM HIS HOME IN PANAMA CITY.  HE WAS </p><p>PLACED IN A CAR WHERE A FRIEND, HECTOR ANTONIO </p><p>ARROCHA RIVAS, HANDCUFFED AND HOODED, WAS </p><p>WAITING.  IN SPITE OF THE HOOD, CEDENO CLAIMS HE </p><p>RECOGNIZED ARROCHA.  ONE OF THE ARMED MEN SHOVED </p><p>CEDENO\'S HEAD DOWN BETWEEN HIS KNEES.  FROM THIS </p><p>POSITION, CEDENO COULD SEE THAT ARROCHA WAS NOT </p><p>WEARING SHOES AND HIS FEET WERE BLOODY BECAUSE HIS </p><p>TOENAILS HAD BEEN PULLED OUT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  A HOOD WAS THEN PLACED OVER CEDENO\'S HEAD. </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT SEE, HE BELIEVES HE WAS </p><p>TAKEN TO FDP HEADQUARTERS IN DOWNTOWN PANAMA </p><p>CITY.  THERE HE WAS STRIPPED TO HIS UNDERWEAR, </p><p>TAPE WAS PLACED OVER HIS EYES, AND HE WAS BEATEN </p><p>AND INTERROGATED CONTINUALLY FOR 20 HOURS (LARGELY </p><p>ON THE LOWER BACK, BUTTOCKS AND THIGHS) BY </p><p>DIFFERENT TEAMS OF MEN USING RUBBER HOSES.  AT ONE </p><p>POINT, A HAMMER WAS USED TO SMASH THE MIDDLE TOE </p><p>ON BOTH FEET.  A DOCTOR WAS PRESENT AND CUT OPEN </p><p>THE BLOOD BLISTER THAT FORMED ON ONE TOE AND TOLD </p><p>HIS TORMENTORS THEY COULD NOT HIT THAT TOE ANY </p><p>LONGER.  AT ANOTHER POINT, HE WAS THROWN INTO A </p><p>TANK OF COLD WATER.  TWICE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  CEDENO STATED THAT QUESTIONING CENTERED AROUND </p><p>AN ALLEGED COUP ATTEMPT HIS CAPTORS ASSUMED MIGHT </p><p>TAKE PLACE IN MID-DECEMBER.  CEDENO SAID THAT IN </p><p>ORDER TO SATISFY HIS INTERROGATORS, HE MADE UP A </p><p>STORY SAYING THAT SUCH A RUMOR MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN </p><p>STARTED BECAUSE PEOPLE BELIEVED NORIEGA WAS HAVING </p><p>TROUBLE PAYING THE FDP. </p><p> </p><p>6.  CEDENO, WHO ONCE WORKED IN THE NATIONAL </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE POLICE (DENI) BETWEEN 1968-70, </p><p>CLAIMED HE WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE A NICKNAME USED </p><p>FOR PANAMA DEFENSE FORCES (FDP) COL. AROSEMENA </p><p>KING, NOW HEAD OF G-5 (CIVIC AFFAIRS).  CEDENO </p><p>BELIEVES AROSEMENA KING WAS ONE OF THE MEN WHO </p><p>THREATENED HIM AND TRIED TO ENLIST HIM TO REPORT </p><p>ON THE OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  CEDENO SAID HE WAS PROMISED HIS RELEASE AND </p><p>THAT HIS PARENTS AND BROTHER WOULD NOT BE HARMED </p><p>IF HE WOULD AGREE TO SPY ON THE OPPOSITION.  HE </p><p>CLAIMS HE AGREED AND, TO LEND CREDIBILITY TO HIS </p><p>PROMISE, BARGAINED FOR AND SECURED A MONTHLY </p><p>STIPEND OF USDOLS 1,000.  (CEDENO SAID HE INFORMED </p><p>PDC PRESIDENT ARIAS CALDERON OF THIS "ARRANGEMENT".) </p><p> </p><p>8.  BEFORE HIS RELEASE, CEDENO SAID HE WAS </p><p>REQUIRED TO SIGN A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS.  ONE </p><p>ACCUSED ARIAS CALDERON OF COMPLICITY IN A COUP </p><p>PLOT.  ANOTHER ACCUSED PANAMA CITY\'S CATHOLIC </p><p>ARCHBISHOP MARCOS MCGRATH OF RUNNING AN ILLEGAL </p><p>PRINTING PRESS IN THE SAME LOCAL CATHOLIC </p><p>SECONDARY SCHOOL. </p><p> </p><p>9.  CEDENO SAID THAT IT WAS HIS IMPRESSION THAT </p><p>THE G-2 HE HAD KNOWN WHEN HE HAD WORKED AT THE </p><p>DENI SOME 20 YEARS AGO NO LONGER EXISTED.  IN HIS </p><p>VIEW, THE CURRENT G-2 CONTAINED "DANGEROUS AND </p><p>STUPID" ELEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENT.  EXCEPT FOR THE BRUISES ON HIS BODY </p><p>AND THE DAMAGED TOES, WE HAVE NO WAY OF VERIFYING </p><p>ALL OF CEDENO\'S STATEMENTS.  HIS PHYSICAL </p><p>CONDITION, HOWEVER, AND THE DETAIL WITH WHICH HE </p><p>WAS ABLE TO DESCRIBE HIS EXPERIENCE PROVIDES ADDED </p><p>INSIGHT INTO SOME OF THE THINKING AND METHODS OF </p><p>NORIEGA\'S THUGS. </p><p> </p><p>BUSHNELL </p><p></p></div>
