HANOI 1760  B.  HANOI 1432 </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01780  151057Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  THE NEW NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WILL BEGIN </p><p>MEETING ON JULY 17, BUT HAS YET NOT SCHEDULED THE VOTES ON </p><p>THE NEW GVN AND NA LEADERSHIP (REF A).  THE NEW NA IS NOT </p><p>EXPECTED TO PASS ANY NEW LEGISLATION AT THIS INITIAL SESSION </p><p>OTHER THAN THE BUDGET.  IT REMAINS POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE </p><p>CONTINUED DISAGREEMENTS OVER SENIOR LEADERSHIP SLOTS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  IN A MEETING WITH POL/C ON JULY 15, VICE CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF THE OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (ONA) PHAN THANH SON </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT THE FIRST SESSION OF THE 11TH NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY WILL CONVENE ON JULY 17, TO BE FOLLOWED BY A FORMAL </p><p>OPENING (TO WHICH THE AMBASSADOR HAS BEEN INVITED) ON JULY </p><p>19TH.  THE FIRST TWO DAYS WILL BE SPENT MOSTLY ON PROCEDURAL </p><p>ISSUES, ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT 348 OF THE 498 </p><p>DELEGATES ARE NEWCOMERS (REF B).  ONA HAS DISTRIBUTED TO ALL </p><p>DELEGATES VOLUMINOUS MATERIALS ON NA PROCEDURES AND </p><p>PRACTICES ON WHICH THE DELEGATES CAN BONE UP PRIOR TO THE </p><p>OPENING, SON ADDED, WHILE ADMITTING THAT THERE WAS NO TRUE </p><p>TRAINING OFFERED TO THE NEW DELEGATES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE FIRST NA SESSION IS SCHEDULED TO LAST UNTIL </p><p>ABOUT AUGUST 10, SON NOTED.  ITS MAJOR ORDER OF BUSINESS </p><p>WILL BE THE ELECTION OF A NEW LEADERSHIP SLATE, STARTING </p><p>WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE SRV, FOLLOWED BY THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTERS, AND THEN THE CABINET </p><p>MINISTERS, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, HEADS OF </p><p>OTHER MAJOR GVN ORGANS, THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>STANDING COMMITTEE, AND FINALLY, HEADS OF THE MAJOR NA </p><p>COMMITTEES.  THE NEW STANDING COMMITTEE WILL MAKE THE FINAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01780  151057Z </p><p>DECISIONS ON WHICH 125 DELEGATES WILL BE APPOINTED AS "FULL- </p><p>TIME" MEMBERS.  SON SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE CANVASSED FIRST </p><p>AS TO THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THIS JOB (WHICH WILL IN </p><p>ALMOST ALL CASES INVOLVE EARLY RETIREMENT FROM OTHER PARTY </p><p>OR GOVERNMENTAL JOBS), AND ADMITTED THAT SOME MAY VERY WELL </p><p>DECLINE THE HONOR FOR FAMILY OR OTHER REASONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  (SBU)  SON DECLINED TO PREDICT EXACTLY WHEN THESE </p><p>PERSONNEL "ELECTIONS" BY THE NA WILL TAKE PLACE, AND CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THE SIXTH PARTY PLENUM HAD NOT YET FINALIZED ITS </p><p>DECISIONS ON RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THESE SLOTS.  (SEPARATELY, </p><p>A CPV OFFICIAL CONFIRMED TO POL/C ON JULY 15 THAT THE PLENUM </p><p>HAD ENDED JULY 15 AS PLANNED, BUT WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY </p><p>INFORMATION AS TO THE PERSONNEL RECOMMENDATIONS REACHED BY </p><p>THE PLENUM.)  SON REFUSED EVEN TO PREDICT THAT THE PERSONNEL </p><p>VOTES MIGHT TAKE PLACE DURING THE WEEK OF JULY 22, NOTING </p><p>THE NEED FOR THE NEW NA TO HEAR A NUMBER OF REPORTS FROM THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER AND OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS ABOUT THEIR WORK </p><p>OVER THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS AND PLANS FOR THE NEXT FIVE </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  (SBU)  SON INDICATED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE </p><p>COULD BE COMPETITION ESPECIALLY OVER THE JOBS OF PRIME </p><p>MINISTER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (SUGGESTING - </p><p>- SOMEWHAT IMPROBABLY -- THAT THE PARTY AND STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE MIGHT NOMINATE DIFFERENT CANDIDATES), OR AT LEAST </p><p>THAT THE INCUMBENTS MIGHT NOT BE RE-ELECTED (REF A).  HE </p><p>DECLINED, HOWEVER, TO OFFER ANY PERSONAL OPINIONS ON THIS </p><p>PROCESS OR ITS OUTCOME. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  SON CONFIRMED THAT THE ONLY LEGISLATION THAT WILL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01780  151057Z </p><p>BE CONSIDERED AT THIS INITIAL SESSION WOULD BE THE NATIONAL </p><p>BUDGET.  HE SPECIFICALLY RESPONDED THAT NO BTA-RELATED </p><p>LEGISLATION WILL BE INTRODUCED FOR CONSIDERATION.   THE NA </p><p>WILL CONVENE AGAIN IN OCTOBER FOR NORMAL LEGISLATIVE DUTIES, </p><p>HE NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>7.   (SBU)  COMMENT:  WHILE WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT THE </p><p>PARTY WILL CONTROL THE PERSONNEL PROCESS AND THAT THE NA </p><p>WILL CONFIRM THE PARTY\'S CHOICES, IT APPEARS INCREASINGLY </p><p>LIKELY THAT THE BACKSTAGE DISCUSSIONS OVER LEADERSHIP </p><p>CHOICES HAVE BEEN LIVELY AND PERHAPS CONTROVERSIAL.  WE DO </p><p>NOT EXPECT MUCH OF A TRUE DEBATE OVER NOMINATIONS WITHIN THE </p><p>NA, BUT ITS RATIFICATION PROCESS MAY NOT BE AS AUTOMATIC AS </p><p>BEEN THE CASE IN SOME PREVIOUS NA SESSIONS.  THE DEBATE MAY </p><p>IN ANY EVENT OFFER AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AT LEAST OBLIQUE </p><p>CRITICISM OF SENIOR OFFICIALS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN THE PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTRY, ALLEGED TO BE </p><p>INVOLVED WITH THE NAM CAM CORRUPTION CASE. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
