<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 002118 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION SPECIAL, MAY 19: TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND MOROCCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: Leading Kuwaiti liberals take to the op/ed pages </p><p>to condemn recent terror attacks in the region and link them </p><p>to Arab world failure to address the political, social and </p><p>economic conditions that "breed" Islamic terror. Noticeably </p><p>absent is any tendency to blame the US/Israel/the West for </p><p>this phenomenon. According to writers, steps Arab </p><p>governments must take include eliminating sources of finance </p><p>for terrorists and revising educational curricula that </p><p>incite sectarian hatred and violence. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>2.  "When Terrorism Knocks the Doors" </p><p>Liberal Editor-in-Chief Waleed Al-Nesf wrote in independent </p><p>Al-Qabas (5/18): "The recent terrorist attacks in Saudi </p><p>Arabia and Morocco stressed to us that danger can reach all </p><p>of us. We in Kuwait must be more determined to end terrorism </p><p>within the framework of the law. Our strategy to combat </p><p>terrorism must be to save young men from believing in </p><p>extremism, to learn to be tolerant with others and to </p><p>eliminate the sources of finance for terrorists. We must </p><p>unite with other nations, adopt new means to eliminate </p><p>terrorism and to contribute to implementing new policies to </p><p>combat terrorism." </p><p> </p><p>3.  "It Is In Our Hands, Not In Bush\'s Hands" </p><p>Editor-in-Chief Jassim Boodai wrote in independent Al-Rai Al- </p><p>Aam (5/18): "Unfortunately, some of us have helped in the </p><p>development of [terrorism] but then handed over the problem </p><p>of combating terrorism to the Americans instead of taking </p><p>care of it themselves. Therefore, combating terrorism should </p><p>be in our hands, not in Bush\'s hands. [I]f we fail as </p><p>nations and a society to take the matter into our own hands, </p><p>then we deserve to live in fear." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "The New Terrorism" </p><p>Liberal Kuwait University Political Science Professor, Dr. </p><p>Shamlan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (5/18): </p><p>"Are Arab countries, and the GCC in particular, ready to </p><p>combat terrorism? Until now, most Arab nations have focused </p><p>on the security aspect in confronting terrorism but have </p><p>ignored the economic, social and the political facets. We </p><p>are certain that none of these countries are unilaterally </p><p>capable of confronting terrorism without the assistance of </p><p>other Western nations." </p><p> </p><p>5.   "Those Who Brainwash Minds" </p><p>Liberal Media Advisor to the Acting Prime Minister, Sami Al- </p><p>Nesf wrote in independent Al-Anba (5/18):  "Terrorism and </p><p>suicide attacks are the result of a long accumulation of </p><p>instigations. There are only three solutions to ending </p><p>terrorism and violence: 1) Becoming tougher with the people </p><p>who instigate such actions; 2) Revising the educational </p><p>curricula that call for hatred; and 3) Holding awareness and </p><p>enlightenment programs for the Arab societies." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "America Is Our Friend and Ally" </p><p>Pan-Arabist Editor-in-Chief Ahmad Al-Jarallah wrote in </p><p>independent Al-Seyassah (5/18): "Currently, we have a golden </p><p>opportunity to fight terror by openly declaring our alliance </p><p>with the world\'s superpower, which was also severely hit by </p><p>terror. We have this opportunity, but we hesitate to seize </p><p>it just because we want to sympathize with local and Arab </p><p>opinions, which are anti-American. Kuwait might have </p><p>considered the presence of American forces on our territory </p><p>as an occupation, before the occupation by Iraq. However, </p><p>after Saddam`s army invaded Kuwait in 1990. all Kuwaitis, </p><p>including the political leadership, were then ready to </p><p>cooperate with Washington for the liberation of Kuwait. [W]e </p><p>should openly declare Americans to be our friends and </p><p>allies." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Our Hearts Are With The Saudi Kingdom" </p><p>Liberal Secretary General of the Kuwait Journalists\' </p><p>Association, Faisal Al-Qannai wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Seyassah (5/17): "The terrorist attack in the city of Riyadh </p><p>bears resemblance to the bombings in the US on September 11 </p><p>[2001] and undoubtedly proves that the Kingdom of Saudi </p><p>Arabia is also a target of terrorist acts carried out by Al- </p><p>Qaeda. Gulf countries must do their utmost to take the </p><p>preventive measures needed to provide protection and </p><p>security not only for foreigners residing in the GCC </p><p>countries, but also for all public places. Terrorism does </p><p>not differentiate between religions and nationalities, given </p><p>that many Muslims and Arabs fell victim in the Riyadh </p><p>bombing." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
