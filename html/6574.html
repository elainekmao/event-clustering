SUMMARY:  THE INITIATION OF MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ </p><p>ENVELOPED PRINT AND SATELLITE TV COVERAGE IN THE UAE MEDIA.  ABU </p><p>DHABI TV IS REPORTING THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS LIVE FROM BAGHDAD, </p><p>WASHINGTON, AND OTHER PLACES IN THE REGION.  ABU DHABI TV ALSO </p><p>CARRIED LIVE SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S MARCH 20TH SPEECH AND PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH\'S MARCH 19TH ADDRESS TO THE NATION EXPLAINING THE ONSET OF </p><p>MILITARY ACTION.  AN "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL NOTES THAT IRAQ IS </p><p>ONLY THE BEGINNING AND OTHER ARAB CAPITALS WILL FOLLOW. </p><p>MEANWHILE, AN "AKHBAR AL-ARAB" EDITORIAL BLAMES SADDAM FOR THE </p><p>SUFFERING OF IRAQIS AND THE WAR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  UNDER THE HEADLINE \'A ROAD MAP IS PENETRATING ARAB CAPITALS," </p><p>SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/20: </p><p> </p><p>"THE QUESTION NOW IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT THE WAR WILL START, BUT </p><p>WHAT COMES AFTER IT AND HOW LONG WILL .S. TROOPS STAY IN IRAQ? </p><p>THE MOST DANGEROUS QUESTION IS THE LEVEL OF COORDINATION BETWEEN </p><p>WASHINGTON AND TEL AVIV IN DRAWING NEW GEOPOLITICAL MAPS AND </p><p>RESHAPING THE FUTURE OF THE REGION.  IT HAS BECOME KNOWN THAT </p><p>ONCE U.S. TROOPS ENTER IRAQ THEY WILL NOT DEPART, WHICH HAS BEEN </p><p>CONFIRMED BY NUMEROUS AMERICAN OFFICIALS UNDER THE PRETEXT OF </p><p>CEMENTING PEACE AND STABILITY, THE ELIMINATION OF WMD, AND </p><p>CURTAILING ANY ETHNIC DISPUTES ... IRAQ WILL ONLY BE THE STARTING </p><p>POINT TO RE-MAPPING THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT </p><p>ISRAEL WILL PLAY A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN THIS ... STATEMENTS OF </p><p>AMERICAN OFFICIALS CLARIFY THAT THE WAR AGAINST IRAQ IS ONLY THE </p><p>FIRST STEP.  THE LIST OF NATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS WHICH THE U.S. </p><p>INSISTS ON LABELING AS \'TERRORISTS\' IS EXTREMELY LONG, EXCEPT FOR </p><p>ISRAEL.  THEREFORE, THE AMERICAN MILITARY PRESENCE WAS NOT MEANT </p><p>TO \'LIBERATE\' IRAQIS, BUT TO ACHIEVE A NEW AMERICAN STRATEGY IN </p><p>THE REGION..." </p><p> </p><p>3.  ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL-ARAB" 3/20 </p><p>EDITORIALIZED: </p><p> </p><p>"...THE U.S. AND A HANDFUL OF ITS ALLIES INSIST ON DECLARING WAR </p><p>IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS, WHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE REGIME IN </p><p>IRAQ REJECTS SHOULDERING ITS HISTORICAL RESPONSIBILITY BEFORE GOD </p><p>AND THE ENTIRE NATION AND INSISTS ON RETAINING POWER UNTIL THE </p><p>LAST IRAQI CITIZEN ... WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WE ARE FACING A </p><p>VICIOUS POWER WHICH HAS ITS OWN AGENDA ... AND THE RIGHT THING TO </p><p>DO IN SUCH A SITUATION IS TO SAVE WHAT CAN BE SAVED AND NOT </p><p>SACRIFICE THE NATION FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW INDIVIDUALS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY THEMSELVES HAVE PROVIDED A JUSTIFICATION FOR </p><p>AN UNPRECEDENTED INTERVENTION IN THE REGION\'S AFFAIRS ..." </p><p> </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION READ-OUT </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE GENERAL MOOD IN THE UAE IS SIMILAR TO THAT ELSEWHERE IN </p><p>THE REGION.  MANY EXPRESS FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION AND DEEP </p><p>SADNESS ABOUT WHAT THEY VIEW AS A TRAGIC ENDING TO THE CRISIS. </p><p>MOST OF POST\'S INTERLOCUTORS ARE CONVINCED THAT WAR HAS BECOME </p><p>INEVITABLE AS A RESULT OF SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S STUBBORNNESS AND </p><p>REFUSAL TO STEP DOWN TO AVERT A DESTRUCTIVE WAR AGAINST IRAQ. </p><p>THIS BELIEF IS VERY STRONG IN THE UAE AND REFLECTS THE OFFICIAL </p><p>LINE OF THE UAEG FOLLOWING THE INITIATIVE IT PROPOSED DURING THE </p><p>SHARM EL-SHEIKH OIC SUMMITS.  HOWEVER, THE UAE PUBLIC IS </p><p>EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR FOR OTHER </p><p>ARAB AND NEIGHBORING NATIONS AND FOR THE REGION AS A WHOLE.  THE </p><p>MAIN CONCERN HERE IS WORRY FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND POSSIBLE </p><p>CIVILIAN CASUALTIES DURING THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>5. ONE UAE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE SUMMED UP THE POPULAR </p><p>MOOD THUS:  "EVERYBODY IS CONFUSED.  HOW TO REMOVE SADDAM WITHOUT </p><p>WAR? WAS IT RIGHT TO LAUNCH A WAR? NOBODY IS HAPPY WITH THE WAR, </p><p>NOBODY.  WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND HOW TO HELP </p><p>THEM. WE HOPE THAT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO SADDAM AT THE LAST </p><p>MINUTE.  I WAS NOT FOR PROLONGING THE INSPECTIONS, BUT I AM VERY </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. IF THERE ARE NOT TOO MANY OF </p><p>THEM, THE US WON\'T MAKE TOO MANY ENEMIES IN THE ARAB WORLD." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
