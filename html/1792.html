(U) THIS CABLE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND </p><p>INFORMATION FOR THE PLANNED PRESIDENTIAL MEETING WITH THE </p><p>POPE.  IT UPDATES REFTEL, OUTLINING ASPECTS OF THE USG- </p><p>HOLY SEE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE BELIEVE WILL REQUIRE U.S. </p><p>ATTENTION IN THE NEAR AND MIDTERM. THE MIDDLE EAST WILL </p><p>FEATURE PROMINENTLY.  IN ASIA, VATICAN PRIORITIES WILL </p><p>REMAIN FOCUSED ON CHINA, TAIWAN, VIETNAM AND </p><p>INDONESIA/EAST TIMOR. THE VATICAN IS INVOLVED IN </p><p>MEDIATING AFRICA\'S GREAT LAKES CONFLICT, WHILE CUBA LOOMS </p><p>LARGE AMONG VATICAN INTERESTS IN LATIN AMERICA.  THIS </p><p>CABLE IDENTIFIES AREAS IN WHICH THE U.S. AND THE VATICAN </p><p>SHARE INTERESTS, AND AREAS IN WHICH THERE ARE POLICY </p><p>DIFFERENCES. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION (CONT\'D): THE HOLY SEE </p><p>IS A SUPRANATIONAL ENTITY THAT HAS ITS CAPITAL AND </p><p>TERRITORIAL MANIFESTATION IN THE STATE OF VATICAN CITY. </p><p>THE UNITED STATES BASED ITS 1984 RECOGNITION OF THE HOLY </p><p>SEE IN PART ON THE FACT THAT THE HOLY SEE EXERCISES </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE 109 ACRES OF THE VATICAN CITY STATE. </p><p>HOWEER ALL AMBASSADORS TO THE HOLY SEE, INCLUDING THE </p><p>U.S. AMBASSADOR, ARE ACCREDITED TO THE HOLY SEE AN </p><p>NOT/NOT TO THE STATE OF VATICAN CITY.  THE VATIAN </p><p>INSISTS ON THIS POINT TO REMIND THAT ITS REAC AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PERSONALITY IS GLOBAL.  FOR PRPOSES OF </p><p>THIS CABLE, THE TERMS HOLY SEE AND VATICAN WILL BE USED </p><p>INTERCHANGEABLY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03507  01 OF 04  031719Z </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) BACKGOUND AND INTRODUCTION (CONT\'D):  THE HOLY </p><p>SEE ISONE OF THE OLDEST CONTINUALLY EXISTING </p><p>INTERNATINAL ENTITIES. IT EXERCISED TEMPORAL CONTROL OF </p><p>TE ITAIAN PENINSULA DURING THE MIDDLE AGES, BUT WAS </p><p>COMPLETELY BEREFT OF TERRITORY BETWEEN 1870 AND 1929. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, EVEN DURING THIS PERIOD, MOST NATIONS </p><p>CONTINUED TO RECOGNIZE THE IT AS AN INTERNATIONAL ENTITY </p><p>AND MAINTAINED FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION (CONT\'D): THE VATICAN </p><p>IS ONE OF VERY FEW SOVEREIGN ENTITIES THAT HAVE PRESENCE </p><p>AND REACH IN VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTRY OF THE WORLD. </p><p>ALTHOUGH ITS SOVEREIGNTY IS OVER LIMITED TERRITORY, </p><p>VATICAN TEACHING AND POLICIES CAN INFLUENCE THE OVER ONE </p><p>BILLION ADHERENTS OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.  END </p><p>BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>DEVELOPING POLICY TOWARD THE HOLY SEE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN DEVELOPING U.S. POLICY VIS-A-VIS THIS UNIQUE </p><p>ENTITY, POLICYMAKERS SHOULD THINK OF THE HOLY SEE AS </p><p>SIMILAR TO A TRADITIONAL NATION-STATE, WITH A VARIETY OF </p><p>FACTORS INFORMING ITS FOREIGN POLICY.  THE MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>CONSIDERATIONS IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY DECISION MAKING </p><p>INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>-- RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES/HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS: THE </p><p>VATICAN STRIVES TO TRANSLATE ITS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND </p><p>ITS HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS INTO CONCRETE POLICIES. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03507  01 OF 04  031719Z </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES BASED ON THESE PRINCIPLES </p><p>INCLUDE: SUPPORT FOR THIRD WORLD DEVELOPMENT AND DEBT </p><p>RELIEF FOR POORER COUNTRIES, OPPOSITION TO CAPITAL </p><p>PUNISHMENT, OPPOSITION TO ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION, AND </p><p>OPPOSITION (ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS) TO EMBARGOES; </p><p> </p><p>-- "NATIONAL" SELF-INTEREST: THE HOLY SEE SEEKS TO </p><p>PROTECT CATHOLICS AROUND THE WORLD, ITS OWN POSITION OF </p><p>INFLUENCE, AND ITS VAST WEALTH.  THE VATICAN\'S SUPPORT OF </p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN RESULTS FROM ITS DESIRE TO PROTECT 600,000 </p><p>IRAQI CATHOLICS FROM ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM; ITS REFUSAL </p><p>TO PUBLICLY CRITICIZE CROAT NATIONALIST CLERGY IN BOSNIA </p><p>STEMS IN PART FROM THE CROAT CHURCH\'S STAUNCH DEFENSE OF </p><p>THE FAITH DURING THE COLD WAR; </p><p> </p><p>-- HISTORY/TRADITION: RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND </p><p>SPAIN, PORTUGAL, AND OTHER LATIN COUNTRIES GO BACK OVER </p><p>500 YEARS.  THE VATICAN\'S HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>THESE COUNTRIES FREQUENTLY DEMANDS AN ACTIVE FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY ROLE; </p><p> </p><p>-- PROSELYTISM: THE VATICAN KNOWS THAT IT MUST </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8384 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  03507  02 OF 04  031715Z </p><p>ACTION ECA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    SNIS-00  NISC-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------00B3A7  031716Z /38 </p><p>O 031203Z JUL 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0000 </p><p>WHITEHOUSE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 VATICAN 003507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE, PD/ECA (SEXTON), WHITE HOUSE FOR JOSEPH </p><p>HAGIN, BRADLEY BLAKEMAN AND MARY HAINES, PLEASE PASS TO </p><p>NSC FOR AMB. FREID </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN MESSAGE NO. 107/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/11 </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, IS, EG, CH, ID, VT </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE VATICAN-- THE SUPRANATIONAL POWER </p><p> </p><p>CONTINUALLY REFRESH ITS MESSAGE FOR CHANGING TIMES. </p><p>VATICAN II IN THE 1960S WAS AN EXAMPLE.  INTERFAITH AND </p><p>ECUMENICAL OUTREACH IS AN IMPORTANT FOCUS OF THE CURRENT </p><p>PAPACY, AND PROSELYTISM/POPULATION GROWTH IN THE THIRD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03507  02 OF 04  031715Z </p><p>WORLD ACCOUNTS FOR MUCH OF THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH IN </p><p>RECENT YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) PAPAL HEALTH/SUCCESSION AND WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR </p><p>U.S. POLICY:  POPE JOHN PAUL II IS SURELY THE MOST WIDELY </p><p>RECOGNIZED WORLD LEADER.  ALONG WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES, HE ENJOYS THE HIGHEST STATURE AND PROFILE </p><p>AMONG WORLD LEADERS. IN EARLY 2000, PRESS </p><p>MISREPRESENTATION OF A GERMAN BISHOP\'S REMARKS IN THE </p><p>POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE, </p><p>SPARKED A SERIES OF SPECULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT </p><p>SUCCESSION.  THE POPE AND THE VATICAN STRONGLY DENIED </p><p>THAT HIS CONDITION WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH TO WARRANT </p><p>ABDICATION.  THERE IS LITTLE SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA THAT </p><p>THE POPE WOULD IN FACT RESIGN EVEN IF HIS HEALTH WERE TO </p><p>DECLINE PRECIPITOUSLY.  THE LIST OF CARDINALS WIDELY </p><p>PERCEIVED AS POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY </p><p>AMERICANS, AND ONLY ONE ANGLOPHONE.  AN ELECTION OF A </p><p>EUROPEAN CARDINAL (MOST LIKELY AN ITALIAN) WOULD PROBABLY </p><p>RESULT IN ONLY MINOR CHANGES IN VATICAN POLICY AND ITS </p><p>CURRENT STANCE ON ISSUES VIS A VIS THE UNITED STATES.  IF </p><p>THE NEXT POPE IS FROM LATIN AMERICA, ASIA, OR AFRICA, WE </p><p>SHOULD EXPECT THE VATICAN TO TAKE POSITIONS FURTHER TO </p><p>THE "LEFT OF CURRENT U.S. POSITIONS ON ECONOMIC ISSUES, </p><p>BUT FURTHER "RIGHT" ON SOCIAL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>MIDDLE EAST </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS (MEPP):  THE HOLY SEE </p><p>DENIES WANTING TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03507  02 OF 04  031715Z </p><p>ASPECTS OF THE MEPP, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS KEENLY </p><p>INTERESTED IN WHAT IT TERMS THE "CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS" </p><p>ASPECTS OF THE HOLY SITES IN THE REGION (SPECIFICALLY </p><p>JERUSALEM).  THE VATICAN MAINTAINS THAT ITS CONCERNS HAVE </p><p>BEEN LARGELY IGNORED BY THE USG AND THE ISRAELIS, AND IN </p><p>1999 WORKED WITH THE FRENCH AND SEVERAL OTHER EU </p><p>COUNTRIES IN THE "JERUSALEM WORKING GROUP" (JWG -- SINCE </p><p>INACTIVE). </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  THE VATICAN WAS CLEARLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE USG </p><p>AND GOI DECLINED TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE JWG INITIATIVE. </p><p>THE GOI\'S DECISION TO ALLOW CONSTRUCTION OF THE NAZARETH </p><p>MOSQUE CREATED ALARM (AND IN SOME CASES, RESENTMENT) AT </p><p>THE VATICAN.  THE GOI FOR ITS PART WAS CONCERNED THAT THE </p><p>POPE LEFT UNANSWERED BASHIR ASSAD\'S ANTI-SEMITIC </p><p>INVECTIVE DURING THE POPE\'S MAY 2001 SYRIA VISIT.  WE CAN </p><p>EXPECT CONTINUED TENSION IN THESE AREAS.  THE HOLY SEE </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE MEPP, WHILE </p><p>DENYING THIS INTENTION.  EMBASSY VATICAN CONTINUES TO </p><p>RECOMMEND A HIGH LEVEL VISIT TO ENCOURAGE THE VATICAN TO </p><p>PLAY A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE, OR AT LEAST LESS UNHELPFUL, </p><p>ROLE IN THE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>ASIA </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE VATICAN AND THE U.S. SHARE INTERESTS IN MANY </p><p>OF THE SAME COUNTRIES (E.G. INDONESIA, CHINA, TAIWAN, </p><p>VIETNAM), BUT NOT ALWAYS FOR THE SAME REASONS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION TO THE FORMAL CHURCH NETWORK NUMEROUS, OFTEN </p><p>SEMI-AUTONOMOUS, CATHOLIC MISSIONARY ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03507  02 OF 04  031715Z </p><p>OPERATING THROUGHOUT ASIA HAVE A SOPHISTICATED </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THEIR AREA. </p><p>CONTACT WITH THESE MISSIONARY ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDES </p><p>UNIQUE INSIGHTS INTO CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES. THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE CATHOLIC FAITH IN ASIA IS AN EXPRESS </p><p>GOAL OF THE CHURCH.  THE VATICAN AND ITS CONSTITUENT </p><p>EPISCOPATES ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DIALOGUES WITH </p><p>POLITICALLY POWERFUL MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>FAITHS.  THE RESULTS OF THESE DIALOGUES WILL IMPACT </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR DEMOCRACY, STABILITY, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND </p><p>A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) CHINA:  WITH ITS OWN NETWORK OF CONTACTS AMONG </p><p>CHINA\'S UNDERGROUND AND PATRIOTIC CHURCHES, THE HOLY SEE </p><p>HAS EXCELLENT SOURCES OF INFORMATION REGARDING </p><p>DISSIDENTS, HUMAN RIGHTS, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER THE POPULATION.  THERE IS A </p><p>CONSTANT CONTROVERSY AROUND THE EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  THIS </p><p>ISSUE INVOLVES THE VATICAN\'S RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN AND </p><p>CHINESE GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE. </p><p>BEIJING\'S REGULATION AND OFTEN OPPRESSION OF THE CATHOLIC </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8394 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  03507  03 OF 04  031721Z </p><p>ACTION ECA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    SNIS-00  NISC-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------00B442  031721Z /38 </p><p>O 031203Z JUL 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0000 </p><p>WHITEHOUSE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 VATICAN 003507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.

THE CENTRALIZED STRUCTURE OF THE </p><p>CHURCH AND THE REPORTING SYSTEM WITH THE NUNCIOS AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  03507  03 OF 04  031721Z </p><p>BISHOPS, NOT TO MENTION INDEPENDENT MISSIONARY GROUPS, </p><p>GIVES EMBASSY VATICAN A UNIQUE VIEW OF EVENTS INSIDE </p><p>CHINA. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) VIETNAM:  UNOFFICIAL DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE BETWEEN </p><p>VIETNAM AND THE VATICAN ON ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RELATIONS.  THE GOV\'S ATTEMPT TO CONTROL RELIGIOUS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS IS ONE OF THE MAIN STUMBLING BLOCKS FROM A </p><p>VATICAN PERSPECTIVE.  THE VATICAN\'S ATTEMPTS TO APPOINT </p><p>BISHOPS WITH MINIMAL GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE AND THE </p><p>REPORTING PROVIDED BY ITS NUNCIO ON THESE EFFORTS CAN BE </p><p>USED AS A GAUGE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>ISSUES IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) INDIA:  INDIA HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT SECTARIAN </p><p>VIOLENCE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AS MUCH AGAINST MUSLIMS </p><p>AS CHRISTIANS.  RESOLUTION OF THIS VIOLENCE IS A KEY TO </p><p>DEMOCRACY, STABILITY AND THE GUARANTEE OF HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p>THE VATICAN, LOCAL BISHOPS WHO REPORT TO THE VATICAN, AND </p><p>VARIOUS MISSIONARY ORGANIZATIONS WILL ALL CONTINUE TO BE </p><p>ACTIVE OBSERVERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND DEVELOPMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) INDONESIA:  EAST TIMOR IS POISED TO BECOME THE </p><p>SECOND CATHOLIC COUNTRY IN ASIA (THE OTHER IS THE </p><p>PHILIPPINES).  THE VATICAN, THROUGH ITS BISHOPS, HAS BEEN </p><p>DEEPLY INVOLVED IN RECONCILIATION EFFORTS FOR YEARS.  THE </p><p>VATICAN IS INVOLVED IN RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS IN EAST </p><p>TIMOR.  IN OTHER PARTS OF INDONESIA WRACKED BY SECTARIAN </p><p>VIOLENCE, THE CATHOLIC PRESENCE IS LESS PRONOUNCED, BUT </p><p>CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE </p><p>SITUATION.  CATHOLIC PRELATES HAVE ALSO ACTED AS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  03507  03 OF 04  031721Z </p><p>MEDIATORS BETWEEN OTHER CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES AND MUSLIM </p><p>GROUPS.  VISITS OF THE INDONESIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AND </p><p>PRESIDENT TO THE VATICAN UNDERSCORE THE INFLUENCE THE </p><p>VATICAN HAS ON A COUNTRY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICY INTEREST </p><p>TO THE USG. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) NORTH KOREA:  VATICAN OFFICIALS, AND CATHOLIC </p><p>RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS PERIODICALLY VISIT NORTH KOREA.  WE </p><p>LEARN FROM THEIR VISITS AND WE CAN GIVE SUGGESTIONS TO </p><p>OUR CONTACTS FOR POINTS TO RAISE WITH NORTH KOREAN </p><p>OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>AFRICA </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) GREAT LAKES: VATICAN CONTACTS ADMIT PRIVATELY </p><p>THAT CHURCH RELATIONS WITH LATE DROC PRESIDENT LAURENT </p><p>KABILA BEGAN ON THE WRONG FOOT BECAUSE OF KABILA\'S </p><p>MINDSET AND THE CHURCH\'S PREVIOUS ASSOCIATION WITH THE </p><p>MOBUTU REGIME.  REAL HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>(EVANGELIZATION) CONSIDERATIONS PUT AFRICA ON THE SCREEN </p><p>AT THE VATICAN.  THE VATICAN AFFILIATED SANT\'EGIDIO </p><p>COMMUNITY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT SUPPORTING ROLE IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO MEDIATE THE CRISIS, KEEPING THE </p><p>VATICAN INFORMED OF THEIR EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>LATIN AMERICA </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) CUBA: THE POPE\'S 1998 VISIT TO CUBA HAS NOT </p><p>BROUGHT THE KIND OF PROGRESS ON CHURCH FREEDOM SOUGHT BY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  03507  03 OF 04  031721Z </p><p>THE POPE.  THAT SAID, VATICAN-GOC DIALOGUE HAS CONTINUED </p><p>WITH FOLLOW-UP VISITS TO CUBA BY SENIOR VATICAN OFFICIALS </p><p>-- AND TO THE VATICAN BY CUBAN COUNTERPARTS.  AMONG THE </p><p>TOPICS OF DISCUSSION:  THE GOC\'S TREATMENT OF THE CUBAN </p><p>CHURCH, THE STATUS OF DISSIDENTS, AND THE EFFECTS OF THE </p><p>U.S. EMBARGO, ABOUT WHICH THE HOLY SEE SHARES CASTRO\'S </p><p>CRITICISM.  THE VATICAN IS QUIETLY LOOKING AHEAD TO THE </p><p>DAY WHEN FIDEL CASTRO DEPARTS THE SCENE.  IT IS CONCERNED </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT HIS REPLACEMENT CAN ACTUALLY BE WORSE. </p><p> </p><p>EUROPE </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) THE VATICAN WOULD LIKE TO SEE A UNIFIED, </p><p>CHRISTIAN (IE. CATHOLIC) EUROPE.  AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE </p><p>EXPECTED TO INTENSIFY ITS DIALOG WITH THE LEADING </p><p>PROTESTANT GROUPS IN GERMANY AND SCANDINAVIA.  THE </p><p>VATICAN WILL ALSO CONTINUE ATTEMPTS TO ENGAGE THE RUSSIAN </p><p>CHURCH AND THE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH IN ISTANBUL IN AN </p><p>ATTEMPT TO HEAL THE LATIN/ORTHODOX RIFT.  VATICAN </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THE BALKANS CAN BE USEFUL TO U.S. POLICY </p><p>IF IT IS DIRECTED AT PROMOTING CATHOLIC/ORTHODOX </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8397 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  03507  04 OF 04  031723Z </p><p>ACTION ECA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    SNIS-00  NISC-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------00B486  031723Z /38 </p><p>O 031203Z JUL 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0000 </p><p>WHITEHOUSE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 04 VATICAN 003507 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.
