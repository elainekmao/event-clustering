(C) SUMMARY: DESPITE SOME RECENT PRO-BIOTECH STATEMENTS </p><p>FROM OUR ALLIES IN THE GOI, ITALIAN BIOTECH POLICY CONTINUES </p><p>TO BE DRIVEN BY AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO AND HIS </p><p>ANTI-BIOTECH MESSAGE.  THE PRIME MINISTER APPEARS TO REMAIN </p><p>UNWILLING TO RISK FRICTION WITH ALEMANNO\'S FACTION OF THE AN </p><p>PARTY, BERLUSCONI\'S KEY PARTNER IN THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, VOICES OPPOSED TO ALEMANNO ARE GROWING LOUDER. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) FOLLOWING A JANUARY 22 MEETING BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BERLUSCONI AND VISITING AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE </p><p>PRESIDENT THOMAS DONAHUE, DONAHUE ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY THAT THE </p><p>PM HAD TOLD HIM THE GOI WOULD CONDUCT A POLICY REVIEW ON </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY, WITH AN EYE TOWARD DEVELOPING A NEW POSITION </p><p>BY THE SUMMER.  THE EXCHANGE WAS LATER CONFIRMED BY OUR </p><p>CONTACTS IN THE ITALY AMCHAM WHO SAT IN ON THE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) MINISTER OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES ANTONIO MARZANO, </p><p>SPEAKING AT A JANUARY 23 SYMPOSIUM, SEEMED TO ECHO THIS </p><p>POSITION, ENDORSING ALSO AN END TO THE EU MORATORIUM ON </p><p>BIOTECH APPROVALS.  HIS COMMENTS WERE REINFORCED AT THE SAME </p><p>CONFERENCE BY ITALIAN SENATE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN </p><p>MAURIZIO RONCONI, WHO ARGUED THAT IT WAS ILLUSORY TO SUSTAIN </p><p>THE THEORY OF A GM-FREE ITALY, AND THAT IT WAS TIME TO END </p><p>THE MORATORIUM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) HOWEVER, AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO, AT THE SAME </p><p>EVENT, ARGUED THAT "THE RISKS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY FAR OUTWEIGH </p><p>THE BENEFITS" AND REAFFIRMED HIS INSISTENCE THAT ITALY REMAIN </p><p>BIOTECH-FREE IN AGRICULTURE.  IN AN INTERVIEW THE FOLLOWING </p><p>DAY, ALEMANNO SAID THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND MARZANO\'S </p><p>COMMENTS AND THAT THEY NEEDED CLARIFICATION.  ALEMANNO </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS NO PROVEN HEALTH RISK FROM GMOS NOW </p><p>ON THE MARKET, BUT HINTED ABOUT LONG-TERM RISKS.  HE INSISTED </p><p>THAT AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY HAS NO PLACE IN ITALIAN </p><p>AGRICULTURE.  ITALIAN AGRICULTURE, HE ASSERTED, IS "QUALITY </p><p>AGRICULTURE" AND "HAS LITTLE TO GAIN BY INTRODUCING </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGIES," ADDING THAT "GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS </p><p>WOULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE OUR IMAGE AND OUR ECONOMY."  ASKED </p><p>WHETHER THERE WAS ANY PROSPECT AT ALL OF INTRODUCING </p><p>GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS IN ITALIAN AGRICULTURE, HE </p><p>RESPONDED: "NO, IN MY OPINION, FOR THE TIME BEING THERE IS TO </p><p>BE NO TALK OF IT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) SUBSEQUENT TO THESE EVENTS, THE AMBASSADOR HAD AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK CLARIFICATION FROM THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>CHIEF DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR, GIOVANNI CASTELLANETA, AS TO </p><p>WHETHER PM BERLUSCONI TRULY INTENDED A SERIOUS REVIEW OF GOI </p><p>BIOTECH POLICY, AS DOHAHUE HAD HEARD (AND MARZANO HAD </p><p>STATED).  CASTELLANETA REPLIED THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN </p><p>"SOME MISUNDERSTANDING;"  BERLUSCONI HAD ONLY MEANT TO CONVEY </p><p>THAT HE WOULD "TRY AGAIN" TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH </p><p>AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  WHILE AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO APPEARS </p><p>TO REMAIN IN THE BIOTECH POLICY DRIVER\'S SEAT FOR NOW, AND PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI SO FAR REMAINS UNWILLING TO FORCE THE ISSUE, IT IS </p><p>NOT INSIGNIFICANT THAT PRO-BIOTECH VOICES IN THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ARE GROWING LOUDER. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003ROME00526 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
