Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In an October 24 meeting with SA DAS </p><p>Camp and Ambassador Wills, PM Wickremesinghe was none </p><p>too optimistic about the cohabitation situation, </p><p>indicating that the GSL had tried to work with the </p><p>president to no avail, so far.  The PM did not show his </p><p>cards on what the GSL planned to do vis-a-vis the </p><p>president.  For her part, President Kumaratunga went on </p><p>TV last night to address the nation.  She staked out a </p><p>moderate position on cohabitation, but seemed skeptical </p><p>of the GSL\'s peace initiative.  Although the political </p><p>situation remains volatile, both sides seem to be </p><p>treading very carefully for the moment.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>=================================== </p><p>PM:  Not Optimistic re Cohabitation </p><p>=================================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SA DAS Camp and Ambassador Wills met with Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe on October 25.  Asked about the </p><p>troubled cohabitation situation (see Ref C), the PM </p><p>remarked that his government had tried hard to work with </p><p>President Kumaratunga to no avail, so far.  The GSL, for </p><p>example, had stopped some prosecutions of her supporters </p><p>as a good will gesture.  She was also welcome to </p><p>participate in cabinet meetings, but she refused to </p><p>attend.  She had also failed to fill certain positions, </p><p>which was causing problems for the smooth functioning of </p><p>the government.  It was also not fully clear whether or </p><p>not she supported the government\'s peace initiative. </p><p>She had put herself in position where she could play the </p><p>"spoiler" role if she wanted.  (Note:  See Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>recent skeptical comments about the GSL\'s peace </p><p>initiative in Para 6 below.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Queried about the GSL\'s next steps, </p><p>Wickremesinghe replied that the government had basically </p><p>dropped the idea of trying to pass its "19th" amendment </p><p>to the constitution.  (Note:  In a ruling earlier this </p><p>week, the Supreme Court basically made it extremely </p><p>difficult for the government to proceed with the </p><p>proposed amendment, which was crafted by the GSL to rein </p><p>in executive powers to call parliamentary elections -- </p><p>See Ref C.)  It did not seem likely that the president </p><p>would call an election because she knew her party would </p><p>not do well, he asserted.  The government was </p><p>considering taking steps to slash the budget of the </p><p>president\'s office, but all options were still under </p><p>review.  DAS Camp urged the PM to try to make </p><p>cohabitation work so that the GSL could continue to </p><p>focus on important peace process issues. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Concerning the recent spike in tensions in the </p><p>Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) threatening the GSL\'s </p><p>majority in Parliament, the prime minister said it was </p><p>basically an internal SLMC matter that would fade away. </p><p>The issue that had most disturbed the group of rebel </p><p>SLMC MPs was the continued activities of the Tamil </p><p>Tigers against the Muslim community in the east.  The </p><p>Tigers\' actions had essentially helped spark Muslim </p><p>militancy.  It was critical that the Tigers stopped </p><p>extorting funds from Muslims and abducting them on </p><p>occasion.  In any case, the PM continued, he was meeting </p><p>with the head of the rebel SLMC faction, A.L.M. </p><p>Athaullah, today, and hoped to be able to calm the </p><p>situation down.  (Note:  The rest of DAS Camp\'s meetings </p><p>will be reported Septel, including additional comments </p><p>by the PM.) </p><p> </p><p>================== </p><p>President\'s Speech </p><p>================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) For her part, President Kumaratunga went on TV </p><p>last night to address the nation (text is contained in </p><p>Ref A).  In the somewhat rambling speech, which was </p><p>delivered in English, she staked out a relatively </p><p>moderate position on cohabitation, calling for an end to </p><p>partisan infighting.  On this point, after elaborating </p><p>how she had tried to make cohabitation work, she stated: </p><p> </p><p>"It is now time to put the past behind us.  The petty </p><p>political bickering which has been the bane of our </p><p>political culture must now be confined to the pages of </p><p>history.  As your head of state and president, it is my </p><p>responsibility to bring together all communities and all </p><p>conflicting political parties." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Kumaratunga was skeptical about the GSL\'s </p><p>peace initiative.  She first noted that she fully </p><p>supported the government\'s objective of realizing peace </p><p>for Sri Lanka.  She went on to underscore, however, that </p><p>she did not believe that the Tigers were holding up </p><p>their part of the bargain, stating: </p><p> </p><p>"Seven major incidents of violence have occurred in the </p><p>Eastern Province and have caused serious problems to the </p><p>Muslim people and in some instances to the Sinhalese </p><p>community living in the east.  The civilian </p><p>population...is facing continued problems of extortion, </p><p>kidnap, punishments meted out by an unlawful judicial </p><p>system and recruitment into an illegal police force and </p><p>an equally unlawful military force by the LTTE </p><p>(Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam)." </p><p> </p><p>Kumaratunga urged the GSL to respond to these LTTE </p><p>actions by developing "a clear vision and a policy </p><p>framework" regarding the peace process.  "The government </p><p>owes this to the people," she said. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Although the political situation remains </p><p>volatile, both sides seem to be treading very carefully </p><p>for the moment.  While clearly distrusting Kumaratunga, </p><p>the PM sounded quite tentative, as if he was not sure </p><p>what he wanted to do.  Meanwhile, the president sounded </p><p>relatively tame in her speech last night, not saying </p><p>anything particularly provocative about the government. </p><p>Given these reactions, it is possible that the two sides </p><p>are taking a breather, perhaps trying to read the tea </p><p>leaves before proceeding to next steps.  This might be a </p><p>positive for the government which has to get ready for </p><p>the second round of talks with the Tigers beginning on </p><p>October 31.  That said, we expect the cohabitation </p><p>roller coaster ride to continue its parlous journey. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
