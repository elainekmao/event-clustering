<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001797 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOIST STRIKE GENERALLY OBSERVED IN </p><p>KATHMANDU VALLEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1693 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>SHOPS CLOSED; VEHICLES IDLE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) The general strike, or "bandh," called by Maoist </p><p>insurgents nationwide for September 16 appeared to have been </p><p>generally observed in the Kathmandu metropolitan area.  Only </p><p>about five percent of the shops along main thoroughfares in </p><p>the city opened (although some along less-traveled side </p><p>streets defied the ban), and few private vehicles--with the </p><p>exception of a rare motorcycle or two--were observed plying </p><p>the streets.  Even government vehicles, which had made a </p><p>point of traveling the roads during the five-day strike in </p><p>April, this time seemed few and far between.  Foot traffic, </p><p>however, was heavy, and many Kathmanduites appeared to spend </p><p>the day sitting in front of their shuttered homes and shops, </p><p>chatting.  Sources in the adjoining cities of Patan and </p><p>Bhaktapur reported a similar drop in traffic.  A quick </p><p>telephone survey of five districts in different parts of the </p><p>country revealed that while some shops in district </p><p>headquarters had opened, private vehicles--including </p><p>long-distance buses--were not operating. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>GENERAL CALM; </p><p>SOME BOMBS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  The streets of Kathmandu and adjoining cities were </p><p>generally reported calm throughout the day.  Early in the </p><p>morning two bombs exploded in neighboring Bhaktapur, but no </p><p>casualties were reported.  Security personnel defused another </p><p>would-be early-morning bomb near the entrance to a boys\' </p><p>school in adjoining Lalitpur.  One suspect was apprehended </p><p>after attempting to place a bomb near a popular Kathmandu </p><p>hotel at 6:00 a.m. September 16.  A mid-day report over </p><p>Nepali radio that authorities had apprehended a suicide </p><p>bomber proved to be fictitious. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The preceding day bombs were found at five different </p><p>locations across Kathmandu.  Two of the bombs exploded, one </p><p>less than a kilometer from the British Embassy.  (The </p><p>suspected target was a dairy corporation building; no </p><p>injuries were reported.)  Another explosive, placed near a </p><p>police post, injured five when it detonated. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) That the September 16 strike seems to have been </p><p>better observed, at least in the Kathmandu Valley, by a </p><p>greater portion of the general public than previous bandhs </p><p>over the past year may be attributed to several factors. </p><p>First, the two weeks preceding the bandh witnessed </p><p>intensified Maoist activity, particularly in the form of </p><p>scattered improvised explosive devices, within Kathmandu </p><p>proper (Reftel).  Second, the insurgents\' surprise attacks on </p><p>a police post and a district headquarters in different parts </p><p>of the country, in which more than 100 members of the </p><p>security forces were killed, undoubtedly scared people lulled </p><p>into a false sense of security by the monsoon moratorium on </p><p>hostilities.  Third, the Maoists recently have stepped up </p><p>violent activities against civilian targets--usually </p><p>local-level political figures in rural areas--in an effort to </p><p>discourage participation in upcoming national elections. </p><p>Finally--and perhaps most decisive--was the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) approach to the bandh this time.  Before the </p><p>April bandh, the GON launched a public relations offensive </p><p>against the strike, pledging openly to provide security to </p><p>any business that opened and encouraging private vehicles to </p><p>defy the bandh by running government-plated vehicles up and </p><p>down the streets.  This time, however, the GON made a </p><p>conscious decision to adopt a low-profile reaction in order </p><p>to deny the insurgents any additional publicity for their </p><p>effort.  But absent any clear signal from the GON, this time </p><p>many business owners apparently decided not to take a chance </p><p>and remained closed.  We expect the Maoists to tout the high </p><p>observance of the bandh as a victory. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
