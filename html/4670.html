(SBU) SUMMARY.  DURING A RECENT TRIP TO DAK LAK AND GIA </p><p>LAI PROVINCES IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, THE CONSUL GENERAL </p><p>MET WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS </p><p>(CRA).  IN THESE MEETINGS, CRA OFFICIALS DESCRIBED THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THE SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM </p><p>(SECV) IN FORWARDING APPLICATIONS FOR PROTESTANT CHURCH </p><p>RECOGNITION; DISCUSSED CRA PLANS FOR THE UPCOMING CHRISTMAS </p><p>SEASON; OUTLINED "UNETHICAL" PRACTICES ON THE PART OF SOME </p><p>HOUSE CHURCH LEADERS; AND GAVE UPDATES ON RELIGIOUS </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN THEIR PROVINCES.  THE CG INQUIRED ABOUT </p><p>REPORTS OF HOUSE CHURCH CLOSINGS AND ARRESTS.  THE CRAS </p><p>EITHER CLAIMED NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEMS, OR SAID IF THE </p><p>PROBLEM INVOLVED "UNREGISTERED CONGREGATIONS", IT FELL UNDER </p><p>THE PURVIEW OF "OTHER AGENCIES."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>DAK LAK PROVINCE </p><p>---------------- </p><p>2.  (U)  EMBOFF AND CONGENOFFS MET WITH MR. VO VAN TAI, </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE DAK LAK COMMITTEE ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS (CRA) </p><p>ON NOVEMBER 25.  PROTESTANTS IN DAK LAK BELONG EITHER TO THE </p><p>GVN-RECOGNIZED SECV, OR THE UNREGISTERED CHRISTIAN </p><p>FELLOWSHIP, SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISTS, CHRISTIAN EVANGELICAL, </p><p>OR PENTECOSTAL SECTS.  MR. TAI DESCRIBED PROTESTANTISM IN </p><p>DAK LAK AS HISTORICALLY TAINTED BY A "DEGA" POLITICAL AGENDA </p><p>FOR AN AUTONOMOUS STATE.  HE NOTED THAT THE "ECONOMIC </p><p>ADVERSITY" CAUSED BY THE PROLONGED DROP IN COFFEE PRICES </p><p>CONTRIBUTED TO SOCIAL PROBLEMS.  HE CALLED THE "BREAKDOWN OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01270  01 OF 03  110458Z </p><p>THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GVN, CAMBODIA, AND THE UNHCR </p><p>UNFORTUNATE." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  DAK LAK CRA CHAIRMAN TAI TOLD EMB/CONGENOFFS THAT AN </p><p>SECV REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE (RC) HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN </p><p>THE PROVINCE.  ITS CHARTER SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF </p><p>FOLLOWERS, PASTOR/MISSIONARY CREDENTIALS, ETC. THAT ARE </p><p>NEEDED IN ORDER TO REQUEST REGISTRATION AS AN SECV CHURCH. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MR. TAI, APPLICATIONS FROM TWO CONGREGATIONS </p><p>(ONE ETHNIC MINORITY, ONE VIETNAMESE KINH) ARE UNDER </p><p>CONSIDERATION NOW.  THE SECV RC HAS PASSED ITS </p><p>RECOMMENDATION TO THE CRA, WHICH WILL DO FIELD INSPECTIONS </p><p>OF THE CONGREGATIONS AND THEN PASS ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TO </p><p>THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  SINCE THESE ARE THE FIRST TWO </p><p>APPLICATIONS THE DAK LAK CRA HAS RECEIVED, TAI SAID HE IS </p><p>NOT CERTAIN HOW LONG THE PROCESS WILL TAKE.  HE APPEARED </p><p>CONFIDENT, HOWEVER, THAT BY THE TIME OF A RETURN CONGENOFF </p><p>VISIT (ANYWHERE FROM 2-6 MONTHS), THERE WOULD BE TWO NEW </p><p>REGISTERED CHURCH CONGREGATIONS IN DAK LAK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) FOR CHRISTMAS 2002, THE DAK LAK CRA PLANS TO MEET </p><p>WITH THE BISHOP, PRIESTS, PASTORS AND SECV BOARD OF </p><p>DIRECTORS (IN HCMC) TO REVIEW THE YEAR\'S ACHIEVEMENTS IN </p><p>SOCIO-ECONOMIC POLICIES, ORDAINING NEW PRIESTS, BUILDING NEW </p><p>FACILITIES, ETC.  ACCORDING TO CRA DIRECTOR TAI, HE </p><p>"COMMUNICATES CANDIDLY WITH THE RELIGIOUS DIGNITARIES" AS TO </p><p>WHAT GOOD HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND ALSO THE "NOT SO GOOD." </p><p>HE SAID THE DAK LAK PROVINCIAL CRA INSTRUCTS DISTRICT </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO DO THEIR BEST TO MEET RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS\' </p><p>EXPECTATIONS FOR HELP IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, AS A MEANS </p><p>OF CREATING "SOME EMPATHY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01270  01 OF 03  110458Z </p><p>RELIGIOUS GROUPS."  MR. TAI SAID THAT HE AND HIS COMMITTEE </p><p>VISIT THE REGISTERED (CATHOLIC) CHURCHES WITH GIFTS DURING </p><p>THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) DAK LAK CRA CHAIRMAN TAI NOTED THAT SOME PROTESTANT </p><p>HOUSE CHURCH LEADERS HAD ALLEGEDLY ENGAGED IN UNETHICAL </p><p>PRACTICES.  ACCORDING TO MR. TAI, BELIEVERS HAD CALLED THE </p><p>CRA\'S ATTENTION TO SOME PASTORS WHO HAD COLLECTED DONATIONS </p><p>AND SPENT THEM ON THEMSELVES WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR </p><p>CONGREGATIONS.  HE ALSO STATED THAT SOME GVN-PROVIDED RELIEF </p><p>SUPPLIES HAD BEEN DIVERTED BY A FEW PASTORS FOR THEIR </p><p>PERSONAL USE.  HE SAID THERE WERE REPORTS THAT "DEGA" </p><p>PROTESTANTS IN PARTICULAR USED DONATIONS TO PURCHASE MOBILE </p><p>PHONES AND MOTOR VEHICLES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) QUERIED ABOUT EVENTS IN EAKAR DISTRICT, MR. TAI SAID </p><p>HE WAS AWARE OF TWO BUDDHIST PAGODAS THERE, BUT NO </p><p>(RECOGNIZED) CHURCHES.  THERE IS A TEMPORARY SITE FOR </p><p>(RECOGNIZED) CATHOLIC WORSHIP, BUT THERE IS NO SECV- </p><p>RECOGNIZED PASTOR.  WHEN PRESSED, HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT EAKAR </p><p>AUTHORITIES HAD CRITICIZED SOME PROTESTANT FOLLOWERS "FOR </p><p>BAD PRACTICES", BUT WOULD NOT ELABORATE.  DAK LAK CRA </p><p>CHAIRMAN TAI ACCEPTED AN UNDATED "NON-PAPER" LIST OF CASES </p><p>(REF B) ALLEGEDLY INVOLVING DOZENS OF DETENTIONS, "CHURCH </p><p>CLOSINGS", ETC., BUT DID NOT MAKE A COMMITMENT TO FOLLOW UP </p><p>ON EVERY CASE.  HE DID OFFER TO BRING THE CG TO EAKAR </p><p>DISTRICT ON HER NEXT TRIP TO DAK LAK.

(U)  MR. TAI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT "DUE TO LACK OF EDUCATION </p><p>AT THE DISTRICT, COMMUNE, AND VILLAGE LEVELS, SOMETIMES </p><p>MISTAKES ARE MADE.  WE DO INSPECTIONS AND TRY TO CORRECT </p><p>MATTERS WHEN WRONGDOINGS ARE CALLED TO OUR ATTENTION." </p><p>(NOTE: NATIONAL-LEVEL COMMITTEE ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE INDICATED THAT THE CURRENT DECREE ON RELIGION </p><p>ONLY ALLOWS THEM TO SUGGEST CORRECTIONS, NOT REQUIRE THEM. </p><p>THE GVN IS WORKING TO REVISE THE DECREE.  END NOTE.) </p><p>ACCORDING TO MR. TAI, WHILE THE PROVINCE\'S 412 "SUB- </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS (UNREGISTERED HOUSE CHURCHES) ARE NOT </p><p>APPROPRIATE, IN REALITY THEY ARE ACCEPTED." </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) WHEN ASKED TO IDENTIFY DAK LAK\'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE </p><p>FOR 2003 AND IN THE LONG-TERM, CRA CHAIRMAN TAI CITED </p><p>IMPROVING ETHNIC MINORITY LIVING CONDITIONS -- TO EQUAL, OR </p><p>COME CLOSER TO THAT OF THE VIETNAMESE KINH IN THE PROVINCE. </p><p>TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE, HE IS CONVINCED THAT FOREIGN JOINT </p><p>VENTURES AND INVESTMENT ARE NEEDED. </p><p> </p><p>GIA LAI PROVINCE </p><p>---------------- </p><p>9.  (U) MOVING TO GIA LAI, CG MET WITH THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF THE COMMITTEE ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS (CRA), MR. MAI KIM </p><p>DONG, ON NOVEMBER 26.  HE RELATED THAT AN SECV </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE (RC) HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED THERE, </p><p>CONSISTING OF TWO ETHNIC MINORITY PASTORS AND ONE VIETNAMESE </p><p>KINH PASTOR.  THE GIA LAI SECV RC\'S CHARTER STRESSES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01270  02 OF 03  110458Z </p><p>"SERVING CHRIST, THE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION."  GIA LAI </p><p>PROVINCE HAS THREE REGISTERED SECV "ASSOCIATIONS" </p><p>(CHURCHES), WITH TWO MORE APPLICATIONS PENDING.  IN ORDER TO </p><p>APPLY FOR RECOGNITION, A CONGREGATION MUST HAVE 100 OR MORE </p><p>MEMBERS, BUT MR. DONG SAID HE BELIEVED THE SECV RC CHARTER </p><p>LEFT OPEN THE POSSIBILITY FOR "SUB-ASSOCIATIONS" TO COMBINE </p><p>AND APPLY.  HE ESTIMATED THAT THERE WERE 312 SUB- </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS IN THE PROVINCES, AND SAID THEY WERE ALL </p><p>"OPERATING NORMALLY."  ACCORDING TO HIM, THERE ARE ABOUT </p><p>94,000 PROTESTANTS IN GIA LAI. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) DEPUTY CHAIRMAN DONG POINTED OUT THAT WHILE "DEGA" </p><p>BELIEVERS WORSHIP JESUS, THEY HAVE BROKEN WITH THE SECV RC </p><p>AND ARE NO LONGER RECOGNIZED BY THE SECV.  ACCORDING TO HIM, </p><p>THE SECV BELIEVES HAVING "DEGA" MEMBERS WILL NEGATIVELY </p><p>AFFECT THEIR OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) REGARDING OTHER RECOGNIZED RELIGIOUS FOLLOWERS IN </p><p>GIA LAI, MR. DONG COUNTED NEARLY 76,000 CATHOLICS WHO </p><p>WORSHIP IN 40 CHURCHES.  HE TOLD EMB/CONGENOFFS THERE WERE </p><p>TWO PRIESTS STUDYING IN THE U.S. RIGHT NOW. (NOTE: WHILE </p><p>PRIESTS/MONKS/NUNS FROM REGISTERED RELIGIONS ARE ALLOWED TO </p><p>TRAVEL OVERSEAS, POST KNOWS FOR A FACT THAT AT LEAST IN </p><p>HCMC, MANY "UNREGISTERED" HOUSE CHURCH PASTORS REGULARLY </p><p>TRAVEL ABROAD. END NOTE.)  BUDDHISTS IN GIA LAI NUMBER </p><p>NEARLY 66,000.  SIXTEEN NEW PAGODAS WERE OPENED IN 2002, FOR </p><p>TOTAL OF 70.  ACCORDING TO MR. DONG, THERE ARE 10 MONKS </p><p>STUDYING IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA RIGHT NOW, AND 300 OTHER </p><p>MONKS AND NUNS WHO ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF TRAINING IN GIA </p><p>LAI PROVINCE.  HE CHARACTERIZED THE BUDDHISTS AS "POOR </p><p>COMPARED TO THE CATHOLICS," SO THE PROVINCE WOULD PROVIDE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01270  02 OF 03  110458Z </p><p>TRANSPORTATION FOR THEIR DELEGATES TO THE BUDDHIST CONGRESS </p><p>IN HANOI THIS MONTH.  ALTHOUGH ONE OF OUR ESCORTS WAS </p><p>NUDGING MR. DONG TO WRAP IT UP, DONG PROCEEDED TO SAY THERE </p><p>WERE ABOUT 1000 SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISTS AND CHRISTIAN </p><p>EVANGELICAL BELIEVERS IN GIA LAI - SEPARATE FROM THE SECV - </p><p>AS WELL AS ABOUT 3000 CAO DAI BELIEVERS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) WHEN ASKED TO IDENTIFY GIA LAI\'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE </p><p>FOR 2003 AND THE LONG-TERM, CRA DEPUTY CHAIRMAN DONG </p><p>SIDESTEPPED THE QUESTION BY SAYING HIS COMMITTEE "ONLY </p><p>APPROVES PROPOSALS FROM THE SECV RC."  ACCORDING TO HIM, THE </p><p>CRA ONLY DEALS WITH "REGISTERED CHURCH PROBLEMS.  OTHER </p><p>AGENCIES DEAL WITH UNREGISTERED CONGREGATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) BOTH DAK LAK CRA CHAIRMAN TAI AND GIA LAI CRA </p><p>DEPUTY CHAIRMAN DONG APPEARED PROUD OF THE NATIONAL CRA </p><p>PUBLISHING HOUSE, ESTABLISHED IN 1999.  MR. TAI PRODUCED A </p><p>BROCHURE DETAILING THE DOZENS OF MATERIALS IN STOCK. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MR. DONG, THE SECV "HAS APPLIED" TO HAVE THE </p><p>NATIONAL CRA PUBLISHING HOUSE PRINT THE OLD AND NEW </p><p>TESTAMENTS IN THE JARAI AND BAHNAR ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>LANGUAGES.  PROTESTANT MATERIALS AND WRITINGS BY CATHOLIC </p><p>BISHOPS WHO PREACH IN ETHNIC MINORITY LANGUAGES ARE ALSO </p><p>SOUGHT AFTER, BUT NONE HAS BEEN PUBLISHED YET.

(SBU) BOTH MR. TAI AND MR. DONG CITED ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS, LARGELY DUE TO THE DROP IN INTERNATIONAL COFFEE </p><p>PRICES, AS THE CAUSE FOR ETHNIC MINORITY VILLAGERS\' POOR </p><p>LIVING CONDITIONS.  ENSUING PROTESTS AND FLIGHTS TO CAMBODIA </p><p>WERE INCITED BY "HOSTILE FORCES" IN THE U.S. (REF A). </p><p>HOWEVER, COMPARED TO PREVIOUS VISITS, THE TONE WAS NOT AS </p><p>STRIDENT OR HOSTILE.

(SBU) GVN RECOGNITION OF THE SECV IN APRIL 2001 </p><p>PERMITS THE REGISTRATION OF SECV CHURCHES.  THERE HAS BEEN </p><p>NO RUSH OF CENTRAL HIGHLANDS CONGREGATIONS TO REGISTER.  NO </p><p>DOUBT THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THIS, AS DAK LAK AND GIA </p><p>LAI PROVINCES PROCESS THEIR FIRST REGISTRANTS.  PROVINCIAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES AND THE PROTESTANT HOUSE CHURCHES ARE WARY OF </p><p>EACH OTHER - HOW MUCH CONTROL/OVERSIGHT WILL BE EXERCISED; </p><p>CAN THEY TRAIN ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF PASTORS; WILL THEY BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO FOLLOW THEIR RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCES (DAK LAK\'S MR. </p><p>TAI WAS ADAMANT THAT WHILE PRAYER IS FINE, HUNGER STRIKES </p><p>ARE NOT).  EVEN IF THE PROVINCIAL SECV RCS HAVE DIVORCED </p><p>THEMSELVES FROM "DEGA" ELEMENTS (ESPECIALLY IN GIA LAI), </p><p>THIS DOES NOT ERASE YEARS OF ENMITY.  THE 100-MEMBER MINIMUM </p><p>IS HARD TO ACHIEVE IN THE SPARSELY POPULATED PARTS OF THIS </p><p>REGION, THOUGH IT APPEARS INDIVIDUAL CONGREGATIONS CAN </p><p>COMBINE FOR LARGER NUMBERS FOR REGISTRATION PURPOSES. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01270  03 OF 03  110458Z </p><p>16.  (SBU) POST DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT MANY CONGREGATIONS </p><p>WILL APPLY FOR RECOGNITION IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AS THEY WILL </p><p>WANT TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FIRST REGISTRANTS. </p><p>THIS WILL SET UP A PROTRACTED PERIOD OF CONTENTION AND/OR </p><p>CONFRONTATION IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, AS THE BOUNDARY </p><p>BETWEEN THE LEGAL RIGHT OF VIETNAMESE CITIZENS TO WORSHIP IN </p><p>THEIR HOMES AND THE GVN REQUIREMENT THAT ALL CHURCHES BE </p><p>REGISTERED IS TESTED.
