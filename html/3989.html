<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001927 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10-16-12 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 143 (10-16-02) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Lewis Amselem, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  GSL RE IRAQ </p><p>           MM 2 D </p><p>           MALDIVES/ICC ARTICLE 98 </p><p>           BALASINGHAM/HELGESEN </p><p>           AGREMENT REQUEST </p><p>           JIM WALLER </p><p> </p><p>GSL RE IRAQ </p><p>----------- </p><p>1.  (C) On October 15, Milinda Moragoda passed to the </p><p>Ambassador an advance copy of a statement on Iraq that </p><p>the GSL is planning to release in the near future. </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>--  Sri Lanka welcomes the decision of the government of </p><p>Iraq to allow the weapons inspectors entry into the </p><p>country without any condition. </p><p> </p><p>--  Sri Lanka hopes that the decision of Iraq will pave </p><p>the way for the weapons inspectors to resume their work </p><p>without further delay in that country towards the </p><p>elimination of weapons of mass destruction. </p><p> </p><p>--  Sri Lanka has long argued that Iraq should fully </p><p>comply with all Security Council Resolutions and respect </p><p>its international commitments to avoid further escalation </p><p>of tension in the region.  End text. </p><p> </p><p>MORAGODA\'S MEETING WITH D </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) Moragoda is eager to know when he will have his </p><p>meeting with the Deputy Secretary.  He has been invited </p><p>to Tokyo by the Japanese to discuss donor issues; his </p><p>travel to Japan is contingent on when he sees D.  He </p><p>would appreciate an answer asap. </p><p> </p><p>MALDIVES/ICC ARTICLE 98 </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>3.  (C) You would have seen our front-channel yesterday </p><p>reporting the latest on where the GSL stands on signing </p><p>the bilateral agreement (Colombo 1919).  We are </p><p>essentially just waiting for the GSL to name a time for </p><p>the signing ceremony (unless some problem crops up).  We </p><p>will keep on it.  By the way, we have not forgotten the </p><p>Maldives.  The Maldivians still have not gotten back to </p><p>us re our recent dipnote on this issue (and our many </p><p>previous entreaties).  Our idea now is to wait until we </p><p>have the GSL signature in the bag and then approach Male </p><p>again.  That might help enlist the GoRM, we think. </p><p> </p><p>BALASINGHAM/HELGESEN </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>4.  (C) The Ops Center called today to confirm that </p><p>Balasingham was now in Sri Lanka.  In what was certainly </p><p>one of those wacky coincidences that science alone cannot </p><p>explain, we had actually reported on this issue yesterday </p><p>in Colombo 1920!!   The Ops Center promised to read that </p><p>message.  Further details re Balasingham\'s stopover at </p><p>Colombo\'s airport:  At a reception at the Residence last </p><p>night for the visiting Defense Planning team, we were </p><p>told by GSL officials that Balasingham and his wife </p><p>arrived at Colombo\'s airport from London on a regular Sri </p><p>Lankan Airlines flight.  Both he and his wife, Adele, </p><p>were in first class (how revolutionary can you get!!). </p><p>They  were then whisked in a GSL chopper to the Wanni. </p><p>Balasingham apparently used a British passport for </p><p>immigration purposes.  Re Deputy Foreign Minister </p><p>Helgesen, we understand from Milinda that he and his team </p><p>are due to arrive in Colombo this coming weekend. </p><p> </p><p>AGREMENT REQUEST </p><p>---------------- </p><p>5.  (SBU) Just want to make sure that you saw Devinda </p><p>Subasinghe\'s agrement request (Colombo 1918) and are </p><p>processing it.  We also faxed his official c.v. </p><p> </p><p>JIM WALLER </p><p>---------- </p><p>6.  (U) When Jim was last seen, he was getting into a </p><p>vehicle yesterday for a trip down south.  He\'s due back </p><p>in Colombo tonight.  While suffering from loads of </p><p>jetlag, Jim valiantly attended loads of the defense </p><p>planning team\'s meetings earlier in the week. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
