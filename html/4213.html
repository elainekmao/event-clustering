<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003033 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY: PLEASE PASS TO A/S KANSTEINER AND AMB. </p><p>JETER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  FRIENDS OF NIGERIA MEET ON INEC </p><p>PERFORMANCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2831 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons:  1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY:  Ambassador Jeter hosted a second meeting </p><p>with Chiefs of Mission of Germany, France, Canada, and the </p><p>U.K. on October 15 to discuss upcoming Nigerian elections. </p><p>This meeting concentrated on the flawed registration </p><p>process, elections monitors and the need for an agreed upon </p><p>standard by which to judge Nigeria\'s 2003 elections.  The </p><p>group agreed that it should meet with INEC before </p><p>discussing appropriate responses to its perceived failings. </p><p>The group also agreed to meet again following an expected </p><p>meeting with INEC.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ambassador Jeter invited the Chiefs of Mission of </p><p>Germany, France, Canada and the U.K. to continue </p><p>discussions (reftel) October 15.  Canadian High </p><p>Commissioner Howard Strauss, reflecting the broad consensus </p><p>of the group, commented that the flawed registration </p><p>process was the most pressing issue.  He commented that </p><p>this group needed to consider whether to support the </p><p>political process directly through INEC or indirectly </p><p>through NGOs.  "Without our support," Strauss commented, </p><p>"the process is doomed to failure."  Acting British High </p><p>Commissioner Charles Bird cautioned that the group should </p><p>avoid two pitfalls:  "we do not want to validate a flawed </p><p>process and we do not want to be seen leading INEC."  The </p><p>group agreed that without more information from INEC, it </p><p>would be impossible to assess the process.  While all </p><p>agreed on the flaws, it is still impossible to attribute </p><p>the poor performance of INEC to either incompetence or </p><p>malfeasance (or a combination of the two).  The group </p><p>agreed that Canadian High Commissioner Howard Strauss </p><p>should pursue the promised meeting with INEC and report </p><p>back. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Discussion of monitors for Nigeria\'s elections </p><p>took a back seat to the immediate registration issues.  The </p><p>group agreed that the President and INEC were "passing the </p><p>buck" on invitations for elections monitors, each, </p><p>according to Ambassador Jeter, claiming that the other bore </p><p>primary responsibility for decisions on international </p><p>monitors.  Bird suggested "breaking the circle" by </p><p>coordinating a list independently.  DCM Andrews concurred, </p><p>suggesting that a joint U.S.-U.K. list of proposed </p><p>locations of U.S. and British monitors might assist the </p><p>UNDP in developing its own priorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Ambassador Jeter raised the issue of elections </p><p>standards, asking if the INEC and other elections </p><p>structures had sufficient capacity to come close to a </p><p>"free-and-fair" election.  Varying standards were suggested </p><p>including the Carter Center report from the 1999 elections </p><p>and the SADC standards, developed during the recent voting </p><p>in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT:  All attendees at this meeting agreed </p><p>that meeting with INEC was necessary before pursuing </p><p>discussions on the viability of elections in 2003.  The </p><p>group continues to provide a useful forum for comparing and </p><p>coordinating positions related to the upcoming 2003 </p><p>election cycle.  In collaboration with these like-minded </p><p>countries, we will continue to use every opportunity to </p><p>reinforce our message to Nigerian elections officials, </p><p>individually and collectively, as the 2003 elections </p><p>approach. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
