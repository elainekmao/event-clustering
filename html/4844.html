PROPOSED ANTI-WAR RALLY IN ADANA BANNED </p><p>(Bolge)  The Adana Security Directorate has reportedly </p><p>cancelled the proposed anti-war rally to be held by </p><p>the Adana War Opponents Platform on December 22.  Two </p><p>different newspapers reported different reasons for </p><p>the cancellation.  Bolge cited a soccer match, while </p><p>Evrensel reported that the Adana Governor\'s office had </p><p>refused to grant permission due to sensitivity of the </p><p>situation in Iraq, existence of a U.S. base and </p><p>consulate in Adana, intelligence that illegal groups </p><p>might provoke the rally, and personal security of </p><p>American citizens. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.

He also </p><p>called for the closure of Adana\'s Incirlik Air Base </p><p>and cancellation of the Turkey-U.S. and Israel </p><p>agreement.  Evrensel cited the Adiyaman Democracy </p><p>Platform as calling for a more intense struggle </p><p>against the proposed war.  In a Diyarbakir meeting, </p><p>KESK National President Sami Evren also expressed </p><p>opposition to the possible Iraq war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  ADANA AIRPORT RENOVATION PROJECT DELAYED </p><p>(Bolge)  In a press release issued by Adana State </p><p>Airports Administration (DHMI) Director Cengiz Asikli, </p><p>the repair and maintenance project of the Adana </p><p>Airport, closed to flights on November 4, was </p><p>suspended on December 19 due to heavy rainfall.  The </p><p>project will resume after the rain has stopped. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.

The acquittal was based on an expert </p><p>witness report from the state-run Turkish Radio and </p><p>Television (TRT) saying the songs sung at the Congress </p><p>were about love, nature and longing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  USE OF KURDISH NAMES STILL A PROBLEM </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Mersin Birth Registry Director refused </p><p>to register the Kurdish name "Zozan" ("Plateau") that </p><p>parent Ali Askan wanted to give to his four-year-old </p><p>daughter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  HASHISH SEIZURE </p><p>(Turkiye)  Acting on a tip, Batman police seized 15 </p><p>kilograms of hashish powder, 200 kilograms of hashish, </p><p>and materials and tools used in producing hashing </p><p>powder in two separate operations.  Five suspects were </p><p>arrested.  In addition, 28.9 kilograms of unprocessed </p><p>heroin were confiscated in Yuksekova (Hakkari).
