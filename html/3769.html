<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001758 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT:JMANN/ACHAMBERS; ALSO PASS SA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-20-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, KCRM, PINS, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Foreign Terrorist Organizations:  Sri Lanka update </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  State 179250 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Per Reftel Action Request, Mission has carefully </p><p>reviewed the Sri Lanka section of the 2001 Patterns of </p><p>Global Terrorism Report.  Mission provides the following </p><p>update for Department\'s review: </p><p> </p><p>-- The Sri Lankan government continues to support the </p><p>global campaign against terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>-- Domestic situation:  For the first time since 1995, </p><p>the GSL and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) </p><p>held peace talks, September 16-18.  (Note:  The LTTE is </p><p>a FTO-listed organization.)  The Norwegian government </p><p>facilitated the talks, which took place in Thailand.  By </p><p>all accounts, the talks were successful, with both sides </p><p>agreeing to meet again in coming months, and to form </p><p>joint bodies to look into humanitarian- and </p><p>demilitarization-related issues.  There was also </p><p>agreement that Muslim leader Rauf Hakeem would meet with </p><p>LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran in October.  The focus of </p><p>this meeting would be to decrease LTTE-Muslim tensions, </p><p>especially in Sri Lanka\'s ethnically mixed Eastern </p><p>Province (see more on this situation below).  Also of </p><p>importance was that in a press conference held at the </p><p>end of the talks the chief LTTE negotiator made remarks </p><p>that edged away from an outright demand for a separate </p><p>state for Tamils. </p><p> </p><p>-- The GSL lifted its legal ban on the LTTE on </p><p>September 4, 2002.  The GSL took this step in order to </p><p>facilitate the peace process, as the LTTE had demanded </p><p>that the ban be lifted as an explicit condition for the </p><p>group\'s entry into peace talks.  The GSL\'s ban had been </p><p>in place since January 1998.  Although symbolic, the </p><p>lifting of the ban has had little practical effect.  An </p><p>estimated 800 Tamils accused of being terrorist </p><p>operatives linked with the LTTE remain incarcerated </p><p>under Sri Lanka\'s Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) </p><p>provisions, for example. </p><p> </p><p>-- A ceasefire, which began in December 2001 and was </p><p>formalized into a "cessation of hostilities" accord in </p><p>February 2002, remains in effect as of September 2002. </p><p> </p><p>-- A recent statement issued by the Norwegian </p><p>government-run Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) </p><p>reports that violations of the February accord by both </p><p>sides decreased dramatically in recent months.  Almost </p><p>all of the violations were minor, with most of them </p><p>attributed to the LTTE.  The reported violations by the </p><p>LTTE include instances of forced recruitment for its </p><p>military (some of it of children), and the widespread </p><p>extortion of money from Tamils and Muslims.  (Note:  The </p><p>LTTE recently released some children who had been </p><p>forcibly recruited.) </p><p> </p><p>-- There have been no reports of terrorist violence </p><p>(suicide bombings, etc.) by the LTTE since the ceasefire </p><p>began in December 2001.  The LTTE has not renounced the </p><p>use of terrorism, however. </p><p> </p><p>-- There have been instances of Muslim-Tamil violence in </p><p>which people have been killed in past months, including </p><p>a series of incidents in late June in the Eastern </p><p>Province.  The LTTE has been accused of some degree of </p><p>involvement in the June incidents, but these reports are </p><p>not confirmed.  The LTTE has also been accused in at </p><p>least one incident involving the killing of a Tamil said </p><p>to be an opponent of the group.  The LTTE has denied any </p><p>involvement. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
