<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004506 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PUBLIC\'S UNEASINESS ABOUT DIRECTION OF </p><p>U.S.-JORDANIAN RELATIONSHIP </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 139546 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Despite healthy bilateral economic, trade, </p><p>political, and military ties, confusion and uncertainty about </p><p>recent developments on both bilateral and regional issues </p><p>have made many Jordanians uneasy about the direction of the </p><p>US-Jordan relationship.  The press has pulled together a </p><p>number of issues -- delays in visa issuance to students, </p><p>public discussion of the MARLO notice of possible MIF </p><p>searches in the Red Sea/Gulf of Aqaba, press speculation </p><p>about U.S. intentions toward Iraq -- as signs of U.S. </p><p>unhappiness with Jordan.  The general edginess of the </p><p>Jordanian public is likely to be a continuing factor in the </p><p>government\'s calculations on policy pronouncements across the </p><p>board.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>AREN\'T YOU OUR FRIENDS ANYMORE? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Several recent events -- U.S. press stories alleging </p><p>that the US is basing troops in Jordan for an offensive </p><p>against Iraq, the controversy over the participation of </p><p>Prince Hassan in a meeting of exiled Iraqi officers in </p><p>London, the public discussion of the month-old announcement </p><p>of possible MIF inspections of ships in the Red Sea, and </p><p>lengthened processing time for visas (see reftel) -- have </p><p>caught the attention of Jordanians both in and out of </p><p>government.  The confluence of these events over the past </p><p>month has caused some Jordanians to wonder about the </p><p>direction of Jordan\'s relationship with the U.S.  Ongoing </p><p>violence in Israel and the West Bank/Gaza and rising regional </p><p>tension because of speculation about a U.S. military strike </p><p>on Iraq are compounding this uneasiness about the </p><p>U.S.-Jordanian relationship. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>IRAQ: THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  In Jordan, the GOJ has been on the defensive for the </p><p>last month vis-a-vis its position on Iraq.  Jordanian </p><p>officials first scrambled to confront U.S. press stories </p><p>outlining Jordan\'s alleged role in a U.S. offensive against </p><p>Iraq.  The government\'s overreaction -- a too-strong denial </p><p>of the presence of U.S. forces in the Kingdom -- and the </p><p>King\'s ill-considered public statements in London succeeded </p><p>only in convincing many Jordanians (and especially the press) </p><p>that the U.S. media reports of Jordan as a "launching pad" </p><p>for an attack must be true.  Former Crown Prince Hassan\'s </p><p>highly visible role at a meeting of exiled Iraqi military </p><p>officers in London further fueled speculation that Jordan was </p><p>somehow angling for a Hashemite role after regime change in </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  In this context, MARLO\'s announcement of the </p><p>possibility of resumed MIF inspections of ships leaving Aqaba </p><p>was given great belated play in the press.  At a time when </p><p>senior GOJ officials -- including the King -- were trying to </p><p>calm a suspicious public about Jordanian policy on Iraq, the </p><p>MIF announcement was widely interpreted as an expression of </p><p>U.S. unhappiness with Jordan or pressure on the GOJ. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>VISAS </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Jordanians, particularly those getting ready to send </p><p>their children to the U.S. for education or medical </p><p>treatment, have been surprised and deeply worried by the long </p><p>waits for visas.  The lengthened processing time due to the </p><p>Visas Condor program -- and particularly the Consular </p><p>Section\'s inability to tell visa applicants when/whether they </p><p>will be permitted to travel -- resulted in several rumors </p><p>claiming that the U.S. had stopped issuing visas to </p><p>Jordanians altogether.  Senior GOJ officials have been </p><p>swamped with requests to intervene with the Embassy to speed </p><p>up visa issuance.  A senior MFA contact complained to us this </p><p>week that the visa issue alone had so distracted GOJ </p><p>officials that many took it as a sign of U.S. unhappiness </p><p>with Jordan.  Our argument that security concerns are </p><p>paramount meets with considerable sympathy in the abstract, </p><p>but the more sophisticated of our contacts insist that an </p><p>American-educated political elite is a key investment in the </p><p>future.  The less sophisticated simply put in a plea for </p><p>children, nieces, nephews, or cousins. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  Many of our interlocutors seem to have given in to </p><p>the worry that recent events represent a negative shift in </p><p>U.S. attitudes towards Jordan -- objective evidence of the </p><p>strength of relations notwithstanding.  In a tense region </p><p>with no relief in sight, anxiety among the public is probably </p><p>inevitable, but is nonetheless a problem for officials </p><p>mapping out responsible policies on the MEPP and Iraq while </p><p>looking over their shoulders at a dissatisfied and uneasy </p><p>public. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
