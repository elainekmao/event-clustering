BRUSSELS 3812 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 211439 </p><p>     C. THE HAGUE 1900 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting Economic Counselor Todd Kushner.  Reason 1.5(b) a </p><p>nd (d) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C/NF) The Netherlands central bank has tasked Dutch </p><p>financial institutions to search their records for any </p><p>accounts linked to the former Iraqi regime and to immediately </p><p>freeze any that are discovered regardless of whether they are </p><p>on a UN list.  Dutch officials admit that the EU regulation </p><p>implementing UNSCR 1483 provides a legal basis only for </p><p>freezing assets listed by the UN.  However, they have decided </p><p>to implement a more extensive blocking regime and plan to </p><p>unfreeze assets only if ordered to by a Dutch court. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Nevertheless, the Dutch would like to see as </p><p>extensive a UN listing process as possible to provide not </p><p>only legal cover but improved identifiers.  They are </p><p>struggling to develop standards for asset freezing.  Must </p><p>they freeze accounts of firms where a company owned by the </p><p>former Iraqi regime is a minority shareholder?  The accounts </p><p>of a firm where a former Iraqi official is one member of an </p><p>extensive board of directors?  The Dutch have asked for </p><p>specific information on how U.S. financial institutions are </p><p>implementing UNSCR 1483. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Clarifying ref c, the Dutch indicate that the EU </p><p>regulation implementing UNSCR 1483 addresses freezing and </p><p>transfer of Iraqi assets but does not address confiscation. </p><p>Confiscation was left out of the regulation after legal </p><p>experts asserted that confiscation is not an area of </p><p>community competence.  Thus it is up to each member state </p><p>individually to implement UNSCR 1483\'s confiscation </p><p>requirements.  The Dutch will require new legislation to do </p><p>so. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
