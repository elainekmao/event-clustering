<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 KHARTOUM 04769 </p><p> </p><p>ROME ALSO FOR VATICAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O.112356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, PHUM, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISLAMIZATION OF SOUTHERN SUDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: KHARTOUM 3990 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THERE IS CLEAR AND MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>THE NIF-DOMINATED GOVERNMENT IN KHARTOUM HAS EMBARKED ON </p><p>A CAMPAIGN TO ISLAMIZE SOUTHERN SUDAN AND THOSE </p><p>SOUTHERNERS, MOSTLY DISPLACED, LIVING IN THE NORTH.  IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH, THE GOS/NIF IS </p><p>UNDERTAKING POLICIES TO GAIN ISLAMIC CONTROL OF REGIONAL </p><p>AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CIVIL SERVICE.  OVER THE </p><p>PAST TWO YEARS, THE SENIOR AND MIDDLE RANKS OF LOCAL </p><p>ADMINISTRATION AND CIVIL SERVICE HAVE BEEN "WEEDED-OUT", </p><p>WITH MUSLIM-SOUTHERNERS AND HARDLINE GOS/NIF SUPPORTERS </p><p>REPLACING PROFESSIONAL SENIOR OFFICERS AND OTHER </p><p>EMPLOYEES.  FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF GOS EDUCATIONAL </p><p>POLICIES, NON-MUSLIM CHILDREN IN THE GOS-CONTROLLED TOWNS </p><p>OF JUBA, RENK, MALAKAL, WAU, AND RAJA ARE COMPELLED TO </p><p>LEARN ARABIC AND STUDY ISLAM.  SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO </p><p>USE ARABIC AS THE SOLE LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION, EVEN </p><p>SCHOOLS RUN BY CHRISTIANS.  IN JUBA, THE EQUATORIA STATE </p><p>MINISTER OF EDUCATION RECENTLY DECREED THAT ISLAM MUST BE </p><p>TAUGHT BEGINNING AT THE NURSERY SCHOOL LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE NORTH, NON-MUSLIM, SOUTHERNERS FACE ROUTINE </p><p>HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION, CONCURRENTLY RECEIVING THE </p><p>MESSAGE THAT IF THEY BECOME MUSLIMS, THEIR LIVES WILL </p><p>IMPROVE.  ISLAMIC GROUPS, MOST NOTABLY THE DA\'WA </p><p>ISLAMIYYA (I.E. THE ISLAMIC CALL), OFFER AID IN THE FORM </p><p>OF FOOD AND MONEY TO INDUCE SOUTHERNERS TO BECOME </p><p>MUSLIMS.  GOS/NIF POLICY HAS MADE CONVERSION TO ISLAM </p><p>CONVENIENT, OFTEN PROFITABLE, AND SOMETIMES NECESSARY FOR </p><p>SURVIVAL IN THE NORTH. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN ADDITION, THE GOS IS ESCALATING PRESSURE ON </p><p>CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL AND INSTITUTIONS.  REPORTS </p><p>OF HARASSMENT, INTIMIDATION, AND INCARCERATION OF CHURCH </p><p>PERSONNEL HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT MONTHS.  MANY BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THIS IS EVIDENCE OF GOS/NIF INTENTION TO EVENTUALLY </p><p>ERADICATE THE "FOREIGN" CHURCH PRESENCE FROM SUDAN, </p><p>THEREBY, THE GOS/NIF HOPES, LEAVING THE FIELD OPEN FOR </p><p>ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE GOS/NIF IS DETERMINED TO LAUNCH A SUCCESSFUL </p><p>ISLAMIZATION CAMPAIGN.  IT HAS CONSOLIDATED ITS HOLD OVER </p><p>LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS IN GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF </p><p>THE SOUTH, WITH THE REPUTED LONG-TERM GOAL OF INTRODUCING </p><p>ISLAMIC LAW TO THE SOUTH.  ALSO IMPORTANT IS THE EFFECT </p><p>GOS/NIF POLICIES HAVE ON SOUTHERN CHILDREN.  THESE </p><p>CHILDREN ARE COMPELLED TO LEARN ARABIC AND ISLAM AND ARE </p><p>LEARNING TO LOOK TO MUSLIMS FOR FOOD AND AID.  THEY ARE </p><p>ALSO ABSORBING THE LESSON THAT NON-MUSLIMS PROBABLY HAVE </p><p>LITTLE HOPE OR FUTURE IN SUDAN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN THE SOUTH </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN 1990, THE GOS DECLARED A FEDERAL SYSTEM OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT FOR SUDAN, OSTENSIBLY GIVING GOS-CONTROLLED </p><p>AREAS OF THE SOUTH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AUTONOMY AND </p><p>EXEMPTING THEM FROM SHARIA (I.E. ISLAMIC LAW). </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY, HOWEVER, KHARTOUM BEGAN A LARGE-SCALE PURGE </p><p>OF SOUTHERN REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CIVIL </p><p>SERVICE, REPLACING MANY NON-MUSLIMS WITH SOUTHERN MUSLIMS </p><p>AND GOS/NIF HARDLINE SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  SOUTHERN SUDAN IS DIVIDED INTO THREE STATES:  UPPER </p><p>NILE, BAHR EL GHAZAL, AND EQUATORIA.  EACH STATE HAS A </p><p>GOVERNOR, DEPUTY GOVERNOR, AND A POPULAR COMMITTEE.  THE </p><p>GOVERNORS, APPOINTED BY KHARTOUM, ARE ALL NON-MUSLIM </p><p>SOUTHERNERS.  FOLLOWING ITS DECLARATION OF FEDERALISM, </p><p>THE GOS APPOINTED HARDCORE NIF SUPPORTERS AS DEPUTY </p><p>GOVERNORS AND AS STATE MINISTERS OF EDUCATION AND </p><p>CULTURE, FINANCE AND COMMERCE.  THESE APPOINTEES </p><p>REPORTEDLY ANSWER ONLY TO KHARTOUM.  THE DEPUTY </p><p>GOVERNORS, AND NOT THE GOVERNORS AS BEFORE, HAVE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE KEY MINISTRIES.  IT IS ALSO </p><p>RELIABLY REPORTED THAT THESE STATE MINISTERS HAVE PURGED, </p><p>OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PURGING, THEIR STAFFS OF </p><p>NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF SUPPORTERS.  THE GOVERNORS HAVE </p><p>THUS BEEN EFFECTIVELY STRIPPED OF MOST REAL POWER.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, ON AUGUST 8, TWO SENIOR AND PROMINENT SOUTHERN </p><p>GOVERNORS WERE REPLACED (REF).  THE NEW GOVERNORS ARE </p><p>ALSO NON-MUSLIM SOUTHERNERS BUT BOTH MEN ARE FIRM </p><p>SUPPORTERS OF THE NIF.  (NOTE:  IN A NATIONALLY-TELEVISED </p><p>SWEARING-IN CEREMONY, THE NEWLY-APPOINTED GOVERNORS WERE </p><p>SHOWN TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE, ONE HAND RAISED, THE </p><p>OTHER ON THE KORAN.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN THE </p><p>SENIOR AND MIDDLE RANKS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND CIVIL </p><p>SERVICE IN GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS HAVE BEEN "WEEDED-OUT" </p><p>AND REPLACED BY MUSLIM-SOUTHERNERS AND HARDLINE GOS/NIF </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  HISTORICALLY, THE BEST SCHOOLS IN THE SOUTH </p><p>HAVE BEEN CHURCH SCHOOLS, SO THE BEST-EDUCATED AND MOST </p><p>EXPERIENCED CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE SOUTH ARE OFTEN </p><p>CHRISTIANS.  MANY OF THOSE REPLACING THEM ARE LESS </p><p>QUALIFIED AND LACK EXPERIENCE; THEIR ONLY QUALIFICATION </p><p>IS THAT THEY ARE MUSLIMS.  FORCED RETIREMENT OF </p><p>NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF SUPPORTERS HAS BECOME WIDESPREAD. </p><p>THERE ARE NOW MANY EDUCATED AND ARTICULATE SOUTHERNERS </p><p>ENCOUNTERED INCREASINGLY IN KHARTOUM WHO "USED TO DO </p><p>SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN THE SOUTH." </p><p> </p><p>9.  IN JULY 1991, A GOS-CONTROLLED NEWSPAPER REPORTED </p><p>THAT THE EQUATORIA POPULAR COMMITTEE HAD BEEN GIVEN </p><p>LEGISLATIVE POWERS, AND THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD </p><p>HENCEFORTH FORMULATE AND PASS LOCAL LAWS.  (NOTE:  THE </p><p>POPULAR COMMITTEES IN BAHR AL GHAZAL AND UPPER NILE WILL </p><p>APPARENTLY HAVE THE SAME MANDATE, ALTHOUGH THERE HAS AS </p><p>YET BEEN NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY </p><p>OPERATING IN THIS MANNER.  END NOTE)  THIS IS IN </p><p>CONTRAST, THE NEWSPAPER POINTED OUT, TO THE POPULAR </p><p>COMMITTEES IN THE NORTH WHICH ARE SOLELY CONSULTATIVE AND </p><p>REGULATORY BODIES.  THE MEMBERS OF THE SOUTHERN POPULAR </p><p>COMMITTEES, IT WAS REPORTED, WILL BE "SELECTED" TO </p><p>"REPRESENT THE PEOPLE UNTIL ELECTIONS ARE HELD." </p><p>ELECTIONS, THE NEWSPAPER EXPLAINED, CANNOT BE HELD NOW </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR.  (FYI:  THIS WAS PREDICTED BY </p><p>OUR SOUTHERN CONTACTS.  END FYI.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENT:  IN EFFECT, THE GOS/NIF IS "PACKING" THESE </p><p>QUASI-PARLIAMENTS.  IT IS REPORTED THAT BRIBERY, IN THE </p><p>FORM OF MONEY, HOUSES, AND POWER, IS OFTEN USED TO GAIN </p><p>THE SUPPORT OF SOUTHERNERS WHO ARE THEN APPOINTED TO THE </p><p>POPULAR COMMITTEES.  THUS, SOME SOUTHERN POLITICIANS, FOR </p><p>FINANCIAL GAIN, SUPPORT THE GOS/NIF AND ITS POLICIES. </p><p>SOME SOUTHERNERS FEAR THAT THE POPULAR </p><p>COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLIES WILL EVENTUALLY BE USED TO "OPT </p><p>INTO SHARIA."  IN EARLY 1991, IN A CONVERSATION WITH </p><p>CHARGE, NIF LEADER HASAN AL-TURABI STATED THAT IF PEOPLE </p><p>IN THE SOUTH VOTED FOR SHARIA IT WOULD BECOME LAW.  IN </p><p>HIS SPEECH OF DECEMBER 31, PRESIDENT AL-BASHIR SAID "THE </p><p>LEGAL SITUATION IN THE SOUTHERN STATES WILL REMAIN AS IT </p><p>IS UNTIL ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW LEGISLATIVE BODIES THAT </p><p>WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED...."  BECAUSE OF THE VAGUENESS OF </p><p>THIS STATEMENT, SOME OBSERVERS FEAR THAT BASHIR SUBTLY </p><p>OPENED UP THE POSSIBILITY THAT SHARIA MIGHT ONE DAY BE </p><p>LEGISLATED FOR THE SOUTH.  THE MAJORITY OF SOUTHERNERS </p><p>ARE NOT MUSLIMS AND, BY ALL INDICATIONS, DO NOT WANT TO </p><p>BE GOVERNED BY ISLAMIC LAW.  SOUTHERNERS FEAR THAT THE </p><p>GOS/NIF WILL MANIPULATE THE POPULAR COMMITTEES SO THEY </p><p>WILL VOTE TO MAKE SHARIA LAW IN THE SOUTH.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE CIVIL SERVICE </p><p>- - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>11.  IN 1991, THE GOS REPORTEDLY RECONSTITUTED THE CIVIL </p><p>SERVICE IN SUDAN.  PREVIOUSLY, NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN </p><p>SUDAN EACH HAD THEIR OWN SEPARATE CIVIL SERVICE.  UNDER </p><p>THE NEW LAWS, SUDAN HAS A SINGLE CIVIL SERVICE </p><p>ADMINISTERED BY AUTHORITIES IN KHARTOUM.  GOS-APPOINTED </p><p>"SECRETARY GENERALS," ALL KNOWN NIF SUPPORTERS, DIRECTLY </p><p>CONTROL THE CIVIL BUREAUCRACY IN EACH SOUTHERN STATE. </p><p>THROUGH THE SECRETARY GENERALS, THE GOS/NIF CONTROLS </p><p>RECRUITMENT OF NEW EMPLOYEES, JOB ASSIGNMENTS, AND </p><p>PROMOTIONS.  THERE ARE REPORTS OF NON-MUSLIMS BEING </p><p>SIDESTEPPED FOR PROMOTIONS, SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS BEING </p><p>REPLACED BY INEXPERIENCED NIF SUPPORTERS, AND NUMEROUS </p><p>INSTANCES OF FORCED RETIREMENT OF NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF </p><p>SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ISLAMIZATION/ARABIZATION OF EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>12.  IN ADDITION TO POLICIES DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>GOS/NIF CONTROL OVER SOUTHERN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, THE </p><p>EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM IN THE SOUTH IS BEING ARABIZED AND </p><p>ISLAMIZED.  REPORTEDLY, THE EQUATORIA STATE MINISTER OF </p><p>EDUCATION RECENTLY DECREED THAT ISLAM BE A COMPULSORY </p><p>SUBJECT IN ALL NURSERY SCHOOLS IN JUBA (NOTE: STUDENTS </p><p>CANNOT ENTER PRIMARY SCHOOL UNLESS THEY HAVE COMPLETED </p><p>NURSERY SCHOOL.  END NOTE).  IN JUBA, IT IS REPORTEDLY </p><p>ALSO OFFICIAL POLICY THAT ALL SCHOOLS, INCLUDING THOSE </p><p>RUN BY CHRISTIANS, MUST USE ARABIC AS THE LANGUAGE OF </p><p>INSTRUCTION, AND ENGLISH MAY NOT BE INTRODUCED AS A </p><p>SUBJECT UNTIL THE FIFTH GRADE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  IN MALAKAL, IN UPPER NILE STATE, THE ONLY SCHOOL </p><p>STILL OPEN IS RUN BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH  (NOTE: ALL </p><p>OTHER SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER AS GOS-ARMY BARRACKS. </p><p>END NOTE).  CHURCH SOURCES REPORT THAT THE UPPER NILE </p><p>MINISTER OF EDUCATION INFORMED THE SCHOOL IN JULY THAT </p><p>ARABIC MUST BE THE SOLE LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION. </p><p>(COMMENT:  THE CHURCH SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE ARABIC LANGUAGE </p><p>TEXTS OR TEACHERS QUALIFIED TO TEACH IN ARABIC.  FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING THEY CONTINUE TO TEACH IN ENGLISH, DESPITE THE </p><p>OFFICIAL ORDER.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>14.  GOS/NIF POLICY HAS LED TO A PROLIFERATION OF </p><p>"KHALWAS," I.E. ISLAMIC PRIMARY SCHOOLS, IN </p><p>GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH.  STUDENTS NOT </p><p>ATTENDING THESE SCHOOLS ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN THEY </p><p>GO ON TO SECONDARY SCHOOL SINCE THEY LACK SKILLS IN </p><p>ARABIC.  MOREOVER, PROPOSED NEW NATIONAL LEGISLATION </p><p>WOULD MAKE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF ISLAMIC AND ARABIC </p><p>STUDIES AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL COMPULSORY FOR CONTINUING </p><p>ON TO UNIVERSITY STUDIES. </p><p> </p><p>15.  HUMAN RIGHTS SOURCES REPORT THAT NORTHERN SECURITY </p><p>FORCES, PRESENT IN GOS-CONTROLLED CITIES SINCE LAST YEAR, </p><p>SOMETIMES BRING NON-MUSLIM CHILDREN INTO THE KHALWAS </p><p>AGAINST THE WISHES OF THEIR PARENTS.  LIKE THE SECURITY </p><p>FORCES OPERATING IN KHARTOUM, THESE WELL-ARMED FORCES </p><p>REPORTEDLY OPERATE ABOVE THE POLICE AND THE ARMY; TO WHOM </p><p>OR WHAT INSTITUTIONS THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE IS UNKNOWN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"RICE MUSLIMS" IN THE SOUTH </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>16.  AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL, SOUTHERNERS ARE BEING </p><p>CONVERTED TO ISLAM WITH FOOD AND MONEY.  THROUGHOUT </p><p>GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH THE THREAT OF </p><p>STARVATION IS VERY REAL.  OPERATING IN THESE AREAS ARE </p><p>MUSLIM GROUPS, MOST NOTABLY THE DA\'WA, WHICH DISTRIBUTE </p><p>FOOD AND OTHER AID.  THEY REPORTEDLY GIVE AID ONLY TO </p><p>THOSE PEOPLE WHO DECLARE THEMSELVES TO BE MUSLIMS AND </p><p>REGISTER AS SUCH.  SIMILARLY, GOS/NIF-SUPPORTED KHALWAS </p><p>PROVIDE FOOD FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND OFFER OTHER FORMS OF </p><p>AID, WHILE GOS-RESTRICTIONS ON CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE </p><p>SIMILAR ASSISTANCE.  EVEN SOME DEVOUTLY CHRISTIAN PARENTS </p><p>SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO THESE SCHOOLS RATHER THAN DEPRIVE </p><p>THEM OF FOOD.  THERE ARE ISOLATED REPORTS OF MONEY AND </p><p>FOOD BEING OFFERED TO PREGNANT MOTHERS TO REGISTER THEIR </p><p>NEWBORNS AS MUSLIMS AND OF PARENTS BEING PAID TO SEND </p><p>THEIR CHILDREN TO KHALWAS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  COMMENT:  MANY CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS LEADERS WE HAVE </p><p>TALKED TO ARE CONVINCED THAT THE MAJORITY OF SOUTHERNERS </p><p>CONVERTING TO ISLAM ARE "RICE MUSLIMS, I.E. THAT THEY ARE </p><p>DOING SO SOLELY BECAUSE THEY WANT FOOD.  THESE LEADERS </p><p>BELIEVE THAT FEW HAVE ACTUALLY ACCEPTED ISLAM AND THAT </p><p>MOST OF THEM WILL REVERT TO THEIR FORMER RELIGION WHEN </p><p>STARVATION IS NOT A CONSTANT THREAT. </p><p>18.  OF MORE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCE, HOWEVER, IS THE </p><p>EFFECT ISLAMIZATION MAY HAVE ON CHILDREN IN </p><p>GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS.  A GENERATION OF NON-MUSLIM </p><p>CHILDREN NOW SPEAK BETTER ARABIC THAN THEIR TRIBAL </p><p>LANGUAGE AND ARE TAKING TO ISLAMIC CUSTOMS.  WHEN THEY </p><p>ARE HUNGRY THEY CAN GO TO THE KHALWA, TO THE MOSQUE, OR </p><p>TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE DA\'WA, BUT THEY CANNOT EXPECT </p><p>THE SAME PROVISIONS FROM THE NEEDY CHURCHES.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>... AND IN THE NORTH </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>19.  IN THE NORTH, WHERE AS MUCH AS ONE-QUARTER OF THE </p><p>POPULATION OF SOUTHERN SUDAN IS NOW DISPLACED (AS MANY AS </p><p>2,500,000 PEOPLE), THE NEED FOR AID IS ACUTE.  MOST </p><p>DISPLACED LIVE IN CAMPS OUTSIDE KHARTOUM, WITH MEAGER </p><p>FACILITIES AND FEW RESOURCES.  AS IN THE SOUTH, ISLAMIC </p><p>GROUPS, INCLUDING THE DA\'WA, DISPENSE RELIEF.  THIS </p><p>RELIEF IS, ONCE AGAIN, RESERVED FOR MUSLIMS.  ONE SOURCE </p><p>REPORTS HAVING GONE WITH A GROUP OF REFUGEES TO RECEIVE </p><p>FOOD.  HE RECOUNTED HOW EACH REFUGEE WAS ASKED TO GIVE </p><p>THEIR NAME.  IF THEY GAVE A MUSLIM NAME, THEY WERE GIVEN </p><p>FOOD; IF THEY GAVE A CHRISTIAN NAME, THEY WERE NOT.  THEY </p><p>HAD THE OPTION, OF COURSE, OF CONVERTING, TAKING A MUSLIM </p><p>NAME, AND THEN RECEIVING FOOD.  (NOTE: IN ISLAM, A SIMPLE </p><p>DECLARATION IS ALL THAT IS REQUIRED FOR CONVERSION.  END </p><p>NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>20.  NON-MUSLIM SOUTHERNERS IN THE NORTH ARE ROUTINELY </p><p>DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN SCHOOLS, THE WORKPLACE, AND IN </p><p>THEIR EVERYDAY EXISTENCE.  AT THE SAME TIME IT IS MADE </p><p>CLEAR THAT IF THEY BECOME MUSLIMS THEIR LIVES WILL BE </p><p>MUCH EASIER.  MANY SOURCES REPORT THAT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, </p><p>NON-MUSLIM CHILDREN ARE HARASSED, GIRLS ARE PROPOSITIONED </p><p>AND INSULTED, AND NON-MUSLIM STUDENTS ARE OFTEN GRADED </p><p>UNFAIRLY.  THEY ALSO ARE COMPELLED TO STUDY ARABIC AND </p><p>ISLAM.  ALTHOUGH SOME SCHOOLS, RUN BY SOUTHERNERS, EXIST </p><p>IN THE DISPLACED CAMPS, REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE GOS/NIF </p><p>PLANS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEM.  THE GOS DESIRES TO PLACE </p><p>MUSLIM NORTHERNERS AS INSTRUCTORS TO TEACH ARABIC AND </p><p>ISLAM TO THE DISPLACED.  AS WITH THE SOUTH, GOS/NIF </p><p>ISLAMIZATION POLICIES ARE CLEARLY AIMED AT CHILDREN OF </p><p>SOUTHERNERS.  SUCH POLICIES HAVE SERIOUS LONG-TERM </p><p>RAMIFICATIONS FOR NON-MUSLIMS IN THE NORTH. </p><p> </p><p>21.  SOUTHERNERS ALSO OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING </p><p>EMPLOYMENT.  OUR SOURCES REPORT THAT CHRISTIAN EMPLOYEES </p><p>ARE FREQUENTLY SINGLED OUT FOR JOBS WHICH REQUIRE THEM TO </p><p>WORK DURING SUNDAY MASS OR ON THEIR RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS. </p><p>IN KHARTOUM THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS REPORTS OF </p><p>CHRISTIANS BEING EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES BY MUSLIM </p><p>LANDLORDS; SOME OF THESE LANDLORDS REPORT THAT THEY ARE </p><p>PRESSURED NOT TO RENT TO CHRISTIANS. </p><p> </p><p>22.  IN ADDITION TO THIS OVERT DISCRIMINATION, </p><p>SOUTHERNERS IN THE NORTH ARE BEING EFFECTIVELY ISLAMIZED </p><p>BY THEIR ENVIRONMENT.  SOUTHERNERS IN THE NORTH KEEP AN </p><p>ISLAMIC WORK WEEK (SUN-THURS).  THEY RECEIVE BONUSES AND </p><p>VACATIONS FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS FOR RAMADAN AND THE EID, </p><p>BUT NOT FOR CHRISTMAS OR EASTER; THEIR FAMILIES THUS ARE </p><p>BEGINNING TO CELEBRATE ISLAMIC HOLIDAYS.  SOME CHRISTIAN </p><p>SOUTHERNERS HAVE ALSO BEGUN TAKING PART IN GOS-SPONSORED </p><p>"MASS MARRIAGES."  THIS IS A PRACTICE INTRODUCED BY THE </p><p>GOS IN RECENT MONTHS TO PROMOTE THE INSTITUTION OF </p><p>MARRIAGE AS A SOCIALLY STABILIZING FORCE.  PUBLIC </p><p>CEREMONIES ARE CONDUCTED IN WHICH LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE </p><p>ARE MARRIED BEFORE MUSLIM AND, IN A FEW CASES, CHRISTIAN </p><p>CLERGY.  COUPLES MARRYING IN THESE MASS CEREMONIES </p><p>RECEIVE MONEY AND GIFTS FROM THE GOVERNMENT.  (NOTE: </p><p>THESE MARRIAGES HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED BY THE CHRISTIAN </p><p>CHURCH AS AN ATTEMPT TO ATTRACT NON-MUSLIMS TO ISLAM. </p><p>END NOTE).  MANY SOUTHERN WOMEN IN THE NORTH ARE DONNING </p><p>THE TRADITIONAL NORTHERN FEMALE DRESS, THE TOBE.  THE </p><p>TOBE IS A GARMENT WHICH COVERS A WOMAN UP FROM HEAD TO </p><p>FOOT BUT NOT THE FACE.  THOSE WOMEN WHO WEAR THE TOBE ARE </p><p>GENERALLY SPARED SOME HARASSMENT. </p><p> </p><p>23.  COMMENT:  AS A RESULT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND THE </p><p>GOS/NIF\'S ISLAMIZATION CAMPAIGN, MANY SOUTHERNERS IN THE </p><p>NORTH NOW SPEAK ARABIC, STUDY ISLAM, AND TAKE TO ISLAMIC </p><p>CUSTOMS.  BOTH YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE ARE GIVEN THE SAME </p><p>MESSAGE, BLATANTLY OR SUBTLY--THAT IT IS BETTER TO BE A </p><p>MUSLIM THAN A NON-MUSLIM.  GOS/NIF POLICIES HAVE </p><p>ACCORDINGLY MADE BECOMING A MUSLIM CONVENIENT, OFTEN </p><p>PROFITABLE, AND SOMETIMES NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL IN THE </p><p>NORTH.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RECEPTIVITY TO ISLAM </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>24.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SOME SOUTHERNERS, WHETHER </p><p>LIVING IN THE NORTH OR THE SOUTH, ARE MORE RECEPTIVE TO </p><p>ISLAM THEN OTHERS, DEPENDING ON THEIR TRIBAL AND REGIONAL </p><p>BACKGROUND.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE TRIBES IN THE UPPER NILE </p><p>REGION (DINKA, SHILLUK, NUER) ARE REPORTEDLY LESS </p><p>SUSCEPTIBLE TO ISLAMIZATION, GIVEN THEIR STRONG TRIBAL </p><p>TRADITIONS AND STRUCTURES.  THEIR CULTURAL BACKGROUND, </p><p>INCLUDING EXPERIENCE WITH SLAVERY AND COLONIALISM ALSO </p><p>MAKES THEM SUSPICIOUS OF OUTSIDE INFLUENCE.  TRIBES IN </p><p>EQUATORIA ARE, APPARENTLY, NOT AT ALL OPEN TO ISLAM. </p><p>EQUATORIA HAS NO BORDERS WITH THE NORTH AND THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN HISTORICALLY LITTLE CONTACT OR ASSIMILATION.  MOST </p><p>EQUATORIANS ARE FOLLOWERS OF TRADITIONAL RELIGIONS AND </p><p>THEY MAINTAIN STRONG CULTURAL AND TRIBAL CUSTOMS. </p><p>SLAVERY AND ITS ATTENDANT WARFARE HAVE MADE THEM HOSTILE </p><p>TO OUTSIDERS, ESPECIALLY MUSLIMS. </p><p> </p><p>25.  IN CONTRAST, TRIBES LIVING ON THE BORDER WITH THE </p><p>NORTH, DUE TO LONG-TERM INTERACTION WITH NORTHERNERS, ARE </p><p>ALREADY SOMEWHAT ASSIMILATED AND THUS, OUR SOURCES </p><p>SPECULATE, MORE RECEPTIVE TO ISLAM.  THE TRIBES IN BAHR </p><p>EL GHAZAL, IN SOUTH EASTERN SUDAN, HAVE HISTORICALLY </p><p>INTERMARRIED AND MIXED WITH THE NORTHERNERS LIVING ON </p><p>THEIR BORDERS.  THEY HAVE ASSIMILATED FOR CONVENIENCE AND </p><p>ARE, AS A RESULT, MORE EASILY ISLAMIZED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HARASSMENT OF CHURCHES </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>26.  THE ACTIVITIES OF NON-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING SCHOOLS, HAVE BEEN SHARPLY CURTAILED BY THE </p><p>GOS.  USING THE 1962 FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY ACT AS A </p><p>TOOL, THE GOS FORBIDS THE BUILDING OF CHURCHES, CHURCH </p><p>FACILITIES (INCLUDING SCHOOLS) AND THE ORGANIZATION OF </p><p>CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES.  CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ARE MONITORED CLOSELY AND THE AMOUNT OF </p><p>FUNDS THEY MAY EXPEND IS LIMITED BY GOS REGULATIONS.  THE </p><p>RESULTING LACK OF RESOURCES MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE </p><p>CHURCHES TO COMPETE WITH MUSLIM GROUPS.  THE DA\'WA, AND </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS LIKE IT, ARE ABLE TO OFFER FOOD, CLOTHING, </p><p>AND OTHER FORMS OF AID, WHILE MANY CHRISTIAN </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS CAN, IN COMPARISON, OFFER LITTLE MORE THAN </p><p>FAITH.  IN THE GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH, </p><p>NUMEROUS MOSQUES AND KHALWAS ARE BEING BUILT WHILE </p><p>CHURCHES CONTINUE TO BE DENIED PERMITS TO BUILD OR REPAIR </p><p>FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>27.  CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL THROUGHOUT SUDAN ARE </p><p>ROUTINELY HARASSED AND INTIMIDATED.  THOSE WORKING FOR </p><p>CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IN SUDAN FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME CAN </p><p>EXPECT TO BE INTERROGATED AND/OR ARRESTED BY SECURITY. </p><p>RECENTLY THE GOS INCARCERATED A CATHOLIC PRIEST AND THREE </p><p>OF HIS STAFF IN DONGOLA, IN NORTHERN SUDAN, AND TRIED TO </p><p>EXPEL FOUR OF MOTHER TERESA\'S MISSIONARIES.  MANY </p><p>SUDANESE CHRISTIANS, AS WELL AS SOME RESIDENT DIPLOMATS, </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THIS TREATMENT OF THE CHURCHES AND THEIR </p><p>LOCAL AND FOREIGN PERSONNEL IS EVIDENCE OF GOS/NIF </p><p>INTENTION TO EVENTUALLY ERADICATE THE "FOREIGN" CHURCH </p><p>PRESENCE FROM SUDAN, THUS LEAVING THE FIELD OPEN TO </p><p>ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT AND CONCLUSION </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - </p><p> </p><p>28.  THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO DOUBT THAT THIS </p><p>NIF-DOMINATED GOVERNMENT HOPES TO ISLAMIZE SOUTHERN SUDAN </p><p>AND THOSE SOUTHERNERS LIVING IN THE NORTH.  GOS/NIF </p><p>POLICIES SEEM DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT SOUTHERN MUSLIMS </p><p>AND THEIR SYCOPHANTS WILL DOMINATE SOUTHERN POLITICS. </p><p>SUCH TACTICS FUEL SOUTHERNERS\' WELL-FOUNDED FEARS THAT </p><p>THEY WILL EVENTUALLY BE GOVERNED BY SHARIA.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CHURCH, ALREADY </p><p>UNFRIENDLY AND INHOSPITABLE, IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE </p><p>OBSTRUCTIONIST.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE CHILDREN OF </p><p>SOUTHERNERS, THE NEXT GENERATION OF SOUTHERN CITIZENS AND </p><p>LEADERS, ARE BEING AGGRESSIVELY ISLAMIZED AND ARABIZED. </p><p>THE IMPLICATIONS FOR SUDAN\'S FUTURE, IF THIS EFFORT IS </p><p>SUCCESSFUL, WILL BE RADICAL AND TRANSFORMING AND WILL </p><p>IMPACT ON THE STABILITY OF THE ENTIRE REGION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>O\'NEILL </p><p></p></div>
