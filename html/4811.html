Summary: The Nepali education system has suffered </p><p>tremendously in the country\'s nearly seven years of ongoing </p><p>Maoist insurgency.  Private schools have been shut down by </p><p>the insurgents and teachers afraid of Maoist violence have </p><p>abandoned their posts.  Public schools that are open often </p><p>are crowded far beyond their capacity.  Students have </p><p>reported that they are afraid to stay in school for fear of </p><p>being forcibly recruited into the Maoist ranks. Educational </p><p>strikes, violence against teachers, attacks on school </p><p>property and fear of getting caught in the middle of clashes </p><p>between government and Maoist forces have terrified children </p><p>trying to concentrate on their studies. Overcrowded </p><p>classrooms have seriously compromised the quality of </p><p>education.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>SCHOOLS CLOSED AND TEACHERS DISPLACED </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Since the beginning of Nepal\'s Maoist insurgency in 1996, </p><p>at least 700 private schools have been forcibly closed, </p><p>according to estimates by the Private and Boarding School </p><p>Organization of Nepal (PABSON).  President of the </p><p>association Rajesh Khadka has stated that in 25 districts, </p><p>the insurgency has forced all private schools to close their </p><p>doors. </p><p> </p><p>3. Sources at the Department of Education (DOE) say that </p><p>they have yet to complete a comprehensive assessment of the </p><p>effect of the insurgency on public schools, but estimate </p><p>that 3,000 teachers have been displaced by the Maoists, </p><p>beaten or killed.  The DOE estimates that 100,000 students </p><p>are unable to attend school as a result. </p><p> </p><p>4. Human rights organizations and interest groups cite </p><p>figures that are considerably higher. According to the </p><p>Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), a human rights NGO, </p><p>2,000 schools have been closed down nationwide, and 60,000 </p><p>children are unable to attend school in Surkhet district </p><p>alone.  The Nepal Teachers\' Organization asserts that many </p><p>teachers in outlying areas have moved to district </p><p>headquarters, while a number of others have been detained by </p><p>security forces or the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>PUBLIC SCHOOLS: OVERCROWDED, POORLY FUNDED </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. As private schools are shut down by the insurgency, </p><p>students are forced to move to already overburdened public </p><p>schools.  Overcrowding in rural areas has reached crisis </p><p>levels, with teacher to student ratios reaching 1:100 in </p><p>some districts.  "And that\'s if all of the teachers show </p><p>up," say analysts at World Education, an NGO monitoring the </p><p>insurgency\'s impact on education. "If teachers have been </p><p>displaced or simply don\'t come to school, there are even </p><p>more students in a single classroom.  There is nowhere for </p><p>them to sit, no supplies for them to use, or sometimes no </p><p>teachers at all." </p><p> </p><p>6. Overcrowding has denied access to public schools for the </p><p>poorest and most disadvantaged children in some areas. </p><p>According to World Education, the press of students has led </p><p>some government schools to enforce more strictly their </p><p>documentary requirements for entry, in order to reduce </p><p>enrollment.  Students who cannot provide birth certificates, </p><p>proof of citizenship or other evidence that they are </p><p>entitled to public school education are simply turned back </p><p>at the door.  Typically, students who are from poor families </p><p>or who have been displaced from their homes are less likely </p><p>to possess the required documents than the students who have </p><p>moved from private schools. </p><p> </p><p>7. Public schools in Maoist-affected areas also are </p><p>suffering from a lack of funds for school management and </p><p>maintenance, as neither the government nor the Maoists </p><p>provide for schools\' financial needs.  The schools visited </p><p>by an NGO assessment team in August lacked sanitation </p><p>facilities, water, furniture, books and supplies.  The same </p><p>NGO found that in western Kailali district, if teachers try </p><p>to raise funds through donations from parents, they are </p><p>harassed by Maoists who see the donations as a fee.  Yet if </p><p>the teachers ask the Maoists themselves for funds, the </p><p>insurgents reply that their aim is not to solve problems but </p><p>to create them to aid the insurgency. </p><p> </p><p>VIOLENCE AGAINST STUDENTS AND TEACHERS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. If social unrest and conflict are beneficial to the </p><p>Maoist cause, the insurgents have spared no effort in </p><p>pursuing their aims in the schools of Nepal.  Bomb attacks </p><p>on school premises, violence against teachers and forced </p><p>recruitment of students have made benefits of education less </p><p>important to many children and parents than day-to-day </p><p>security. Both sides of the conflict use school buildings as </p><p>shelters, and both sides have interrogated students on </p><p>school grounds. </p><p> </p><p>9. Students in southern Siraha district, for example, were </p><p>terrorized by skirmishes between Maoists and government </p><p>forces that took place inside their high school, during </p><p>school hours.  The school was closed for ten days, and </p><p>students are still frightened to attend classes. </p><p> </p><p>10. Children from rural areas have told NGO workers that </p><p>they are afraid to walk to school for fear of being caught </p><p>in the crossfire between government forces and Maoists. </p><p>Post has reported several incidents in which children </p><p>walking to school were killed or injured by Maoist bombs </p><p>(refs B-D). Even simple facts of life have become serious </p><p>threats for rural children--particularly girls--thanks to </p><p>the Maoist practice of placing landmines and bombs in the </p><p>brush near school buildings.  Most of the schools in the </p><p>hills have no toilets, and those that do usually have </p><p>facilities only for the boys.  When children walk away from </p><p>the building and into the bushes, they encounter Maoist </p><p>bombs. </p><p> </p><p>11. As children cope with an environment of fear and </p><p>uncertainty, child welfare officers report that students\' </p><p>attention spans have shortened, they have become more easily </p><p>distracted, and they pay less attention to their studies. </p><p>Available statistics demonstrate that last year\'s school </p><p>results in the rural districts were poor.  In Dipayal, </p><p>capital of Doti district, 17 of the 25 primary schools </p><p>failed to have a single student pass the final exam.  Only </p><p>14 students in the district scored higher than the passing </p><p>grade of 32 percent.  In northern Humla, the situation was </p><p>even worse: only four students in the entire district passed </p><p>their exams last year. </p><p> </p><p>12. Violence and threats against teachers have been </p><p>widespread, and many have fled their posts. In eastern </p><p>Bhojpur, for example, approximately 500 students were </p><p>affected when four teachers failed to return to one </p><p>secondary school after the Dasain holidays.  The students </p><p>were unable to complete their math, English, economics or </p><p>science courses in time for annual examinations.  In </p><p>Melamchi, central Sindhupalchowk district, students boarded </p><p>over the doors to their own secondary school building after </p><p>all of the teachers, fearing Maoist attacks, abandoned their </p><p>positions. </p><p> </p><p>EDUCATION STRIKES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. Not only rural students are affected.  Maoist insurgents </p><p>this month declared an "indefinite educational strike" </p><p>throughout the Kathmandu Valley (ref E), closing an </p><p>estimated 5,000 schools and affecting over 500,000 students. </p><p>A nationwide two-day educational strike took place </p><p>concurrently, on December 11 and 12.  Though educational </p><p>organizations in the Valley had initially stated their </p><p>intention to observe the strike, or "bandh," for only five </p><p>days, Maoist violence against schools defying the bandh in </p><p>other areas of the country led the groups to recant. </p><p>General observance of the strike has been extended until </p><p>December 22. </p><p> </p><p>14. The Maoists have declared nationwide strikes throughout </p><p>the past year, almost always to the detriment of education, </p><p>and at least one seems to have been deliberately timed to </p><p>disrupt student schedules.  In April, widespread public </p><p>discontent with a strike slated for the same dates as </p><p>national secondary school exams led Maoists to postpone the </p><p>bandh until later in the month (ref F).  Despite vocal </p><p>public protest of this month\'s indefinite strike, however, </p><p>the Maoists have refused to compromise. </p><p> </p><p>CHILD LABOR, HEALTH, NUTRITION AFFECTED </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. The effects of the ongoing insurgency on education are </p><p>insidious.  Children who have lost parents in the insurgency </p><p>are more likely to have to work to support their families, </p><p>and therefore forgo their education.  Students with no </p><p>access to health care are more likely to miss school as a </p><p>result of illness.  In Rukum, security concerns have put an </p><p>end to a seven-year-old UNFP program that delivered nutrient- </p><p>enriched meals to 13,000 primary school students free of </p><p>cost.  Food stopped reaching schools in September, when </p><p>security forces, suspecting that the supplies were being </p><p>used by Maoists, put an embargo on distribution.  Attendance </p><p>has steadily tapered off since the schools have stopped </p><p>distributing free meals.  One primary school reported a drop </p><p>from 220 students to 120 in the last three months. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16. Maoist claims of being pro-education are becoming more </p><p>ridiculous by the day as regional strikes and nationwide </p><p>warfare continue to deprive students of the chance to go to </p><p>school and the right to security.  Progress in combating </p><p>child labor, increases in literacy and school attendance and </p><p>other gains in the fight for education of Nepali children </p><p>are sliding backwards in the face of the Maoist onslaught. </p><p>Though political parties, NGOs and many donor countries have </p><p>remained relatively silent on the issue until now, the </p><p>recently declared educational strike in Kathmandu has </p><p>sparked some public outcry and a call by human rights groups </p><p>for the government and the insurgents to declare schools as </p><p>"safe havens" or "peace zones."  But though the GON may be </p><p>spurred out of its inertia by public protests, it remains to </p><p>be seen whether the Maoists will back down from their </p><p>intransigent demands and to let Nepal\'s children get back to </p><p>the business of education. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
