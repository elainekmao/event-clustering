<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 15625 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  TURKEY:  1992 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 338430 </p><p> </p><p>1.  PER REFTEL INSTRUCTIONS, THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION </p><p>RESPONDS TO ITEMS (A) THROUGH (I). </p><p> </p><p>A)  THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT HAS NO PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN TRAIN AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE GOT IS PROCEEDING WITH MULTIPLE PROSECUTIONS AGAINST </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISTS AS OF NOVEMBER 1992.  THE TURKISH </p><p>NATIONAL POLICE (TNP) MOUNTED SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL </p><p>OPERATIONS AGAINST DOMESTIC TERRORISTS DURING 1992, MOST </p><p>NOTABLY IN A SERIES OF "SAFE HOUSE" RAIDS IN ISTANBUL, </p><p>ANKARA, ADANA AND IZMIR.  THE TNP TOOK INTO CUSTODY </p><p>SCORES OF PERSONS SUSPECTED OF TERRORIST ACTS.  SOME OF </p><p>THOSE APPREHENDED ARE BELIEVED TO BE AFFILIATED WITH </p><p>DEV-SOL ("DEVRIMCI SOL" OR REVOLUTIONARY LEFT), </p><p>INCLUDING ONE SUSPECT WHO IS CURRENTLY ON TRIAL IN IZMIR </p><p>FOR COMPLICITY IN THE FEBRUARY 1991 ASSASSINATION </p><p>ATTEMPT ON USAF LT. COL. ALVIN MACKE.  (THE PRIMARY </p><p>SUSPECT IN THE MACKE ATTACK IS BELIEVED TO HAVE DIED IN </p><p>1991 WHEN AN IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE HE WAS </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO PLANT EXPLODED PREMATURELY.)  PERSONS </p><p>SUSPECTED OF PARTICIPATING IN ATTEMPTED ROCKET ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST THE U.S. CONSULATE-GENERAL IN ISTANBUL FACE </p><p>TRIAL AT THE STATE SECURITY COURT THERE.  OTHERS ARE ON </p><p>TRIAL FOR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN ON BEHALF OF </p><p>THE OUTLAWED SEPARATIST KURDISTAN WORKERS\' PARTY, THE </p><p>PKK.  ALL PERSONS APPREHENDED BY THE TURKISH NATIONAL </p><p>POLICE AND ARRAIGNED ON CHARGES RELATING TO TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITY ARE KEPT IN DETENTION AS THEIR TRIALS PROCEED. </p><p> </p><p>B)  EMBASSY KNOWS OF NO EXTRADITIONS OR REQUESTED </p><p>EXTRADITIONS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION TO </p><p>DATE IN 1992.  IN NOVEMBER PRESS REPORTS SPECULATED THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY MIGHT REQUEST EXTRADITION OF </p><p>PKK GUERRILLAS, INCLUDING THE PKK MILITARY HEAD OSMAN </p><p>OCALAN, WHO REPORTEDLY HAVE COME INTO THE CUSTODY OF THE </p><p>PESHMERGA FORCES IN NORTHERN IRAQ.  THERE HAS BEEN NO/NO </p><p>OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ON THIS SUBJECT TO DATE. </p><p> </p><p>C)  TURKEY EXPERIENCES NO SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO </p><p>GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS.  THE ABILITY OF TURKISH SECURITY FORCES TO </p><p>CAPTURE PERSONS SUSPECTED OF TERRORIST ACTS IS THE MAIN </p><p>LIMITATION ON MORE PROSECUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>D)  HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION </p><p>HAVE INCLUDED FREQUENT AND VIGOROUS PUBLIC DENUNCIATIONS </p><p>OF TERRORISM.  ANTI-TERROR RHETORIC PUNCTUATED THE </p><p>PUBLIC DISCOURSE OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FROM THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER ON DOWN THROUGHOUT 1992.  THE SEMI-OFFICIAL </p><p>ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY ALSO PROVIDED TRANSCRIPTS OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENTS VOWING TO CRUSH TERRORISM IN </p><p>TURKEY.  THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY HAS COOPERATED WITH </p><p>U.S. AND OTHER THIRD COUNTRY AUTHORITIES TO DETER </p><p>TERRORIST THREATS. </p><p> </p><p>E)  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1992 BY </p><p>THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA, INCLUDE: </p><p>--  ANTI-PKK OFFENSIVES BY MILITARY AND JANDARMA FORCES, </p><p>WHICH HAVE OCCURRED WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN 1992. </p><p>MOST OF THESE HAVE OCCURRED INSIDE TURKEY\'S BORDERS, BUT </p><p>THE MILITARY HAS CONDUCTED CROSS-BORDER OPERATIONS IN </p><p>HOT PURSUIT OF PKK ATTACKERS INTO BOTH IRAQ AND IRAN. </p><p>SINCE OCTOBER 5, A MAJOR OFFENSIVE BY TURKISH MILITARY </p><p>FORCES (IN COOPERATION WITH PESHMERGA FORCES) HAS SOUGHT </p><p>TO DRIVE THE PKK FROM ITS CAMPS IN NORTHERN IRAQ. </p><p>--  TNP RAIDS (ESPECIALLY THOSE IN MAY AND AUGUST) </p><p>AGAINST DEV-SOL SAFEHOUSES IN MAJOR URBAN CENTERS </p><p>RESULTED IN THE CAPTURE OF SOME OF THE TERROR </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S LEADERS ALONG WITH RANK-AND-FILE MEMBERS; </p><p>THE SEIZURE OF WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND MATERIALS FOR </p><p>MAKING BOMBS; AND THE ACQUISITION OF DOCUMENTS VALUABLE </p><p>TO INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTER-TERROR OFFICERS. </p><p>--  TURKISH GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS TO STRENGTHEN THE </p><p>ANTI-TERROR POSITION OF THE CSCE, ALONG WITH CONTINUING </p><p>TURKISH SUPPORT OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS </p><p>AND AGREEMENTS ON TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>F)  THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY DOES NOT SUPPORT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM; TURKEY OPPOSES TERRORISM, </p><p>DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL, AND MAKES ITS POSITION </p><p>OUTSPOKENLY CLEAR AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY.  WHILE TURKEY </p><p>DOES MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH IRAN, LIBYA, </p><p>SYRIA, IRAQ AND THE PLO, WE WOULD NOT CHARACTERIZE </p><p>TURKEY\'S RELATIONS WITH THESE AS CONSTITUTING </p><p>"DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT" FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>G)  TURKEY HAS MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>H)  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1991 IN </p><p>TURKEY\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR </p><p>DOMESTIC.  IF ANYTHING, THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ANTI-TERRORIST STANCE HAS BECOME EVEN MORE OUTSPOKEN AND </p><p>ADAMANT. </p><p> </p><p>I)  IN FORMAL TERMS, TURKEY CONSIDERS ITSELF "IN </p><p>COMPLIANCE" WITH UNSCR 748:  TURKISH AIRLINES FLIGHTS TO </p><p>LIBYA AND LIBYAN ARAB AIRLINES FLIGHTS TO TURKEY CEASED; </p><p>TURKEY HAD NO EXISTING MILITARY SUPPLY AND TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE RELATIONSHIP WITH LIBYA; TURKEY BARRED LIBYAN </p><p>ARAB AIRLINES PERSONNEL FROM ITS AIRPORTS AND LAA </p><p>OFFICES CLOSED FOR LACK OF BUSINESS. </p><p>TURKEY HAS NOT, HOWEVER, MADE A "SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION" </p><p>IN DIPLOMATIC STAFFING.  TURKEY MAINTAINS ITS 3-4 PERSON </p><p>EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI (CITING THE NEED TO SERVE THE </p><p>THOUSANDS OF TURKISH CONTRACT EMPLOYEES WORKING IN </p><p>LIBYA) AND REFUSES TO EXPEL ANY LIBYAN DIPLOMATS FROM </p><p>THE EMBASSY IN ANKARA.  (THE DIPLOMATIC BOOK LISTS 11 </p><p>LIBYANS--INCLUDING TWO "FINANCIAL ATTACHES"--AS POSTED </p><p>IN ANKARA.) </p><p> </p><p>BARKLEY </p><p></p></div>
