<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001880 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KWWW, PREL, OPRC, OIIP </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: JORDANIAN STATE-OWNED MEDIA\'S PORTRAYAL OF </p><p>THE WAR </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 81604 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM DOUG SILLIMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B), (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  WE ASSESS JORDAN\'S STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA </p><p>COVERAGE OF THE WAR IN IRAQ TO BE REACTIVE AND CAUTIOUS, </p><p>RATHER THAN INCITEFUL.  REFLECTING BROAD OPPOSITION AMONG </p><p>JORDANIANS TO THE WAR AND ADMIRATION FOR IRAQI RESISTANCE, </p><p>JORDAN\'S STATE-OWNED MEDIA HAVE ADOPTED AN EDITORIAL LINE </p><p>AGAINST OPERATION IRAQI LIBERATION, BUT HAVE SOUGHT TO AVOID </p><p>INFLAMMATORY COVERAGE OR COMMENTARY THAT MIGHT STIR UP </p><p>PASSIONS LOCALLY.  THESE OUTLETS (JORDAN TELEVISION AND THE </p><p>STATE-CONTROLLED ARABIC DAILY "AL-RAI") HAVE ALSO EMPHASIZED </p><p>DOMESTIC ISSUES RELATED TO THE WAR, PROVIDING THE TRADITIONAL </p><p>MOUTHPIECE FOR GOVERNMENT REACTION AND THE VIEWS OF THE KING </p><p>AND HIS SENIOR LEADERSHIP.  IN THIS REGARD, STATE-CONTROLLED </p><p>MEDIA IS CARRYING OUT THE KING\'S "JORDAN FIRST" PROGRAM: </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING AND SYMPATHIZING WITH STRONG VIEWS AGAINST THE </p><p>WAR, BUT WORKING TO PRESERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY BY </p><p>AVOIDING INCITEMENT THAT MAY LEAD TO INSTABILITY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) TELEVISION:  JORDAN TELEVISION RESPONDED TO THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THE IRAQ CONFLICT WITH AN EXPANDED NEWS FORMAT </p><p>THAT INCLUDED IMPLEMENTING A PREVIOUSLY IN-TRAIN PLAN TO </p><p>BROADCAST FROM NEW STUDIOS AND AN UPGRADED TECHNICAL </p><p>PRESENTATION.  HOWEVER, WITH NO CORRESPONDENTS IN THE WAR </p><p>ZONE, OR EVEN IN THE GULF, JTV HAS RELIED ON FOOTAGE FROM </p><p>OTHER SATELLITE NETWORKS, INCLUDING AL JAZEERA, AL ARABIYA, </p><p>ABU DHABI, BBC AND CNN OVER WHICH IT RUNS ITS OWN NEWS </p><p>COMMENTARY FROM THE STUDIO IN AMMAN.  VIEWERSHIP REMAINS LOW </p><p>AND THE PRODUCT UNSATISFACTORY TO MANY JORDANIANS WE CONSULT. </p><p>VIEWERS HERE CONTINUE TO SEEK THEIR WAR NEWS FROM AL </p><p>JAZEERA, AL MANAR, AL ARABIYA AND ABU DHABI TV.  JTV\'S </p><p>EDITORIAL BIAS TENDS TOWARD SYMPATHY WITH THE "IRAQI </p><p>RESISTENCE", THOUGH NOT IN A BRAZEN FORM.  THE OPERATION IS </p><p>REFERRED TO BY NEWS PRESENTERS AS "THE AMERICAN/BRITISH WAR </p><p>ON IRAQ", WITH THE ADJECTIVE "BROTHERLY" SOMETIMES PRECEDING </p><p>IRAQ ("IRAQ AL SHAKIK").  COVERAGE TENDS TO HIGHLIGHT </p><p>CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AND REPORTS OF IRAQI RESISTENCE OR </p><p>COALITION DIFFICULTIES WHILE DOWNPLAYING REPORTS OF FEDAYEEN </p><p>INTIMIDATION OF IRAQI CIVILIANS OR OTHER ISSUES NEGATIVE TO </p><p>THE IRAQI REGIME.  THAT SAID, JTV HAS AVOIDED AIRING THE </p><p>EXTENDED MONTAGES OF CIVILIAN INJURIES OR DEATHS FEATURED </p><p>FREQUENTLY ON AL JAZEERA, A DECISION THAT APPEARS CALCULATED </p><p>TO AVOID STIRRING PASSIONS.  IN KEEPING WITH TRADITION, </p><p>STATEMENTS OR ACTIVITIES OF THE KING, PRIME MINISTER OR OTHER </p><p>SENIOR JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TRUMP WAR COVERAGE AT </p><p>THE TOP OF EVENING NEWS BROADCASTS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) OUTSIDE ITS NEWS SEGMENTS, JTV\'S WAR COVERAGE RELIES </p><p>HEAVILY ON IN-STUDIO TALK SEGMENTS THAT FEATURE KNOWN </p><p>JORDANIAN PERSONALITIES, POLITICAL AND MILITARY ANALYSTS WHO </p><p>ENGAGE IN EXTENSIVE -- AND MANY JORDANIANS SAY DRY -- </p><p>ANALYSIS OF THE WAR.  THIS IS WHERE JTV APPEARS MOST TO BE </p><p>MINIMIZING INFLAMMATORY COVERAGE OF THE WAR.  GUESTS ARE </p><p>CHOSEN FROM AMONG KNOWN JORDANIANS WITH PREDICTABLE </p><p>POSITIONS, WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF ENFORCING A RELATIVELY </p><p>ANODYNE DISCUSSION.  THESE STUDIO GUESTS CAN BE COUNTED ON </p><p>NOT TO INFLAME THE PUBLIC AND TO RESPECT THE CARDINAL RULE OF </p><p>AVOIDING OUTRIGHT CRITICISM OF THE KING OR OF HIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>IN THIS SENSITIVE TIME. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) PRINT MEDIA:  LIKE ITS BROADCAST COUNTERPART, </p><p>GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED AL RAI ARABIC DAILY HAS GENERALLY </p><p>ADOPTED A MORE CAUTIOUS TONE IN ITS WAR COVERAGE WHEN </p><p>COMPARED TO JORDAN\'S TWO OTHER ARABIC DAILIES (AL DUSTOOR AND </p><p>AL ARAB AL YAWM) AND, LIKE JTV, HAS WORKED TO FEATURE THE </p><p>VIEWS OF THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT PROMINENTLY IN ITS DAILY </p><p>COVERAGE OF THE WAR.  AL RAI FEATURES A CLEAR ANTI-WAR BIAS. </p><p>IT HAS REFERRED TO IRAQI DEAD AS "MARTYRS" FROM THE INCEPTION </p><p>OF THE CONFLICT AND HAS FEATURED ABOVE-THE-FOLD COLOR </p><p>PHOTOGRAPHS OF DAMAGED CIVILIAN AREAS, AMERICAN POW\'S, GLOBAL </p><p>ANTI-WAR PROTESTS OR SMOKE RISING FROM BAGHDAD. </p><p>SIDE-BY-SIDE, HOWEVER ARE STATEMENTS BY THE KING, PM OR OTHER </p><p>SENIOR GOJ OFFICIALS EXPLAINING THE GOVERNMENT\'S PRINCIPAL </p><p>PUBLIC POSITIONS:  JORDAN WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE WAR, </p><p>NOR WILL ITS TERRITORY BE USED BY THE U.S. FOR ATTACKS ON </p><p>IRAQ; JORDAN IS WORKING TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE </p><p>WAR; THE KING\'S CONCERN FOR CIVILIAN VICTIMS OF THE WAR, ETC. </p><p> IT HAS NOT FEAUTRED FRONT-PAGE PHOTOGRAPHS OF KILLED </p><p>CIVILIANS OR GRIEVING FAMILY MEMBERS, HOWEVER, MIRRORING ITS </p><p>GENERALLY SUBDUED COVERAGE OF THE SECOND INTIFADA.  AL RAI\'S </p><p>DAILY EDITORIAL HAS, IN KEEPING WITH TRADITION, BEEN MILD IN </p><p>COMPARISON WITH SIGNED OPINION ARTICLES OF JORDANIAN </p><p>POLITICAL ANALYSTS, AND HAS AS OFTEN AS NOT BEEN ABOUT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S OR THE KING\'S PRESCRIPTIONS OR ADVICE FOR THE </p><p>SOCIETY DURING THESE TURBULENT TIMES.  EDITORIAL CARTOONS </p><p>HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY TOUGH IN AL RAI (AS IN ALL OF JORDAN\'S </p><p>ARABIC DAILIES), WITH THE IMPOTENCE OR FAILURE OF ARAB </p><p>REGIMES TO STOP THE WAR AND THE OVER-AGGRESSIVENESS OF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AS COMMON THEMES.  AL RAI IS THE HOST FOR </p><p>JORDAN\'S LEADING COLUMNIST, FAHD AL-FANEK, WHO MIGHT BE </p><p>DESCRIBED AS HARSHLY ANTI-AMERICAN AND PRO-IRAQI IN THE BEST </p><p>OF TIMES.  OVERALL, THOUGH, AL RAI APPEARS TO BE WORKING TO </p><p>CONTAIN AND REFLECT RATHER THAN INFLAME LOCAL PASSIONS. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
