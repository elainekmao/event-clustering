Ambassador Jeter, 16 Mission staff, five </p><p>U.S. invited speakers, along with 18 Moslem </p><p>traditional leaders, intellectuals, and activists </p><p>participated in the conference.  The conference </p><p>served to expose deep suspicions about the U.S. </p><p>among Northern Nigerians, as reflected by the </p><p>academic, political, and religious elites who </p><p>participated in the Conference.  It also was a </p><p>chance for us to clear the air, to some degree, </p><p>of conspiracy theories and clash of culture </p><p>analysis.  The conference was a positive step in </p><p>helping to bridge the gap in perceptions between </p><p>Nigeria  Islamic North and the United States. </p><p>Participants agreed that continued dialogues and </p><p>similar conferences should be held using Mission </p><p>resources and personnel.  The Embassy plans to </p><p>repeat the conference in a series of such </p><p>gatherings in key Northern cities in the future, </p><p>beginning with Katsina following Nigeria  April </p><p>National Elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Post appreciates the Herculean effort by IIP </p><p>and AF/PDPA to support the conference and to </p><p>recruit U.S. Speakers Gwen Mikell, Alan Godlas, </p><p>Lannon Walker, Jennifer Cooke, and Nabeel Khoury. </p><p>This cable evaluates U.S. speakers.  Septel </p><p>follows with comprehensive reporting on the </p><p>conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  ngaging Islam: the Evolution of Islam in </p><p>Nigeria and in the U.S. -Ms. Jennifer Cooke, </p><p>Center for Strategic & International Studies, and </p><p>Dr. Alan Godlas, University of Georgia, responded </p><p>to Professor Ibraheem Sulaiman  presentation on </p><p> he Sharia Initiative in Nigeria. Sulaiman </p><p>asserted that the partnership of Nigeria and </p><p>other Sahelian countries with Islam had been </p><p>rewarding and fruitful and the partnership with </p><p>the West had been minatory.  He claimed the </p><p>influence of Islam in West Africa was wholly </p><p>beneficial while the influence of Western culture </p><p>and economics was negative.  He maintained that </p><p>Western thought was inimical to Islam. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Ms. Cooke noted that Americans knew little </p><p>about Islam and that the media tended to shape </p><p>the perceptions of the general public.  She </p><p>stated that Americans were not  nti-Islam ut </p><p>were concerned that radical Islam posed a threat </p><p>to the U.S. Factors included traditional </p><p>suspicion of government, different perspectives </p><p>on the separation of church and state, and the </p><p>psychological impact of Sept. 11 and the 1998 </p><p>East African Embassy bombings. Her frankness and </p><p>sincerity made her highly credible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At a separate event, Ms. Cooke also lectured on </p><p> emocracy and Good Governance o 50 members of </p><p>women  groups.  They questioned her extensively </p><p>and shared their views of women  participation </p><p>in Nigerian politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Dr. Godlas attempted to show that a  lash of </p><p>culture as avoidable.  He did a comparative </p><p>analysis of American  odernist alues and </p><p>viewpoints with those of Islam.  His conclusion </p><p>was that there were more commonalties than </p><p>differences.  He also asserted that there was a </p><p>drastic change among American Moslems after </p><p>Sept.11 who are now more outspoken about taking </p><p>back  slam rom the extremists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While some Nigerian participants challenged his </p><p>portrayal of Islam in America, Dr. Godlas </p><p>established easy rapport with Nigerian </p><p>participants, many of whom were familiar with his </p><p>Islamic Studies web site.  Dr. Godlas also </p><p>lectured on  slam in the U.S. o 20 members of </p><p>the Moslem Youth Organization of Kano.  The Q&A </p><p>was stimulating and often in Arabic.  He was </p><p>interviewed by the Gamji web site and BBC </p><p>stringers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. ngaging Poverty in Nigeria and U.S. Efforts </p><p>--Ambassador Lannon Walker (Rtd.), Dr. Gwendolyn </p><p>Mikell, Professor and Director of African </p><p>Studies, Georgetown University, responded to Dr. </p><p>Tijjani Naniya  presentation on the  ntecedents </p><p>to Poverty in Nigeria hat blamed colonialism, </p><p>globalization, and over-reliance on oil for </p><p>Nigeria  widespread poverty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Ambassador Walker gave an excellent analysis of </p><p>the Nigerian economy and recommended increasing </p><p>credit to small and medium  zed enterprises, </p><p>the creation of a new approach to debt repayment </p><p>and national development, the downsizing of </p><p>government, increasing crop production, and the </p><p>development of the non-oil sector of the economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Dr. Gwendolyn Mikell suggested alleviating </p><p>poverty by focussing efforts on youth, women and </p><p>the elderly; she suggested that projects similar </p><p>to Ghana   ack to the Farm outh program might </p><p>be useful, but also cautioned against a   ne- </p><p>size fits all evelopment strategy where Nigeria </p><p>would uncritically mimic what has been applied </p><p>elsewhere.  Her lecture in Kaduna following the </p><p>conference was cancelled due to security </p><p>concerns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.   .S. Policy in the Middle East" </p><p>--Dr. Nabeel Khoury reviewed current U.S. peace </p><p>initiatives and challenged participants to name a </p><p>country other than the U.S. that has invested </p><p>more human and material resources to resolve the </p><p>Israeli/Palestinian conflict.  His lecture in </p><p>Abuja on  .S. Middle East Policy as carried on </p><p>network TV two consecutive evenings, and his </p><p>interview with the  ew Nigerian ewspaper was </p><p>front-page news. Dr. Khoury  public lecture and </p><p>radio interview in Kaduna and Kano were cancelled </p><p>at the last minute, following a call to the </p><p>Ambassador from President Obasanjo expressing </p><p>concerns about the public lecture which, he </p><p>thought, was too soon after the  iss World </p><p>Kaduna riots. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.   he Global War on Terror </p><p>--DCM Tim Andrews chaired this session that began </p><p>with a videotaped message from Ambassador Francis </p><p>Taylor followed by a viewing of Secretary </p><p>Powell  January 20 speech on terrorism at the </p><p>UNSC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Dr. Saddiq Mohammed of Ahmadu Bello University </p><p>shared research on northern Nigerian opinion </p><p>showing understanding of the United States </p><p>position on the GWOT yet justifying the increased </p><p>terrorism as a logical consequence of alleged </p><p>biased U.S. policy in the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.   Conclusion:  Candid, at times emotional, the </p><p>conference was a success.  Participants were </p><p>unanimous in requesting more dialogues.  IIP and </p><p>AF/PDPA deserve the lion  share of the credit. </p><p>Despite short notice, holiday leave, and </p><p>uncertainty about Iraq, Maureen Howard, Peter </p><p>Piness, Mona Esquetini, Brenda Butler, Inga </p><p>McMichael, and Pat Attkisson provided </p><p>extraordinary support to make this groundbreaking </p><p>conference a reality. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
