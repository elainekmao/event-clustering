<p>UNCLAS  ROME 002485 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/S LISA JACOBSON AND IO/EDA WINNICK AND KOTOK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR REICH AND HUGHES </p><p>ATHENS FOR CLEVERLY </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, KUNR, ABUD, FAO </p><p>SUBJECT:  REPORT OF FAO 102ND FINANCE COMMITTEE </p><p>1.  Summary.  The 102nd session of the UN Food and </p><p>Agriculture Organization (FAO) Finance Committee met May </p><p>5-9, 2003.  Committee members were divided on the </p><p>question of the 2004-2005 budget level, with the U.S. and </p><p> </p><p>Japan supporting zero nominal growth, G-77 members </p><p>supporting real growth, Switzerland supporting zero real </p><p>growth and the UK silent.  The budget will be examined </p><p>again at the September Finance Committee Session. </p><p>Although recognizing the seriousness of FAO\'s after- </p><p>service medical care liabilities, the Finance Committee </p><p>was not ready to take a decision on funding and will </p><p>consider the matter further in September.  As a result of </p><p>U.S. objections, the Committee sent back the </p><p>Secretariat\'s Split Currency Assessment and Capital </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Budgeting proposals for more work.  These will be before </p><p>the September Finance Committee session for decision as </p><p>well.  Throughout the session, USDel stressed </p><p>accountability and the need to ensure that proper </p><p>financial management controls were in place, as </p><p>recommended in last year\'s Report of the External Auditor </p><p>and this year\'s Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) report.  As </p><p>noted in the JIU report, poor personnel practices and </p><p>weak management at FAO country offices seriously hamper </p><p>FAO\'s work and must be kept at the top of the agenda. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The 102nd session of the FAO Finance Committee (FC) </p><p>met May 5-9, chaired by Humberto Molina Reyes (Chile) and </p><p>Anthony Beattie (UK) as Vice-Chair.  The nine member </p><p>committee is composed of Tanzania, Pakistan, the UK, </p><p>Kuwait, Japan, Chile, Switzerland, Senegal and the U.S. </p><p>The entire report of the Finance Committee will be sent </p><p>to the FAO 124th Council session (June 23-28, 2003). </p><p>Those items on which the Council must take action are </p><p>noted below. </p><p> </p><p>I. Financial and Budget Reports </p><p>------------------------------------_ </p><p> </p><p>3.  Agenda Item 3, Annual Report on Budgetary Performance </p><p>and Program and Budgetary Transfers: </p><p> </p><p>-- As in previous years, the main variance from the </p><p>budget concerns the shortfall in support cost income </p><p>resulting from the decline in development projects being </p><p>implemented by the FAO.  The Committee once again called </p><p>on FAO to adequately plan for the risk and the impact of </p><p>reduced income earnings. </p><p> </p><p>-- Director of Program and Budget, Tony Wade, told the </p><p>Committee that FAO recognized the need to adapt to </p><p>declining income.  Wade noted that the FAO Director </p><p>General (DG) did not want to increase support cost </p><p>charges; rather, FAO "would be able to manage the </p><p>reduction through re-deployment of staff." </p><p> </p><p>-- At the request of USDel, the FC Report notes "concern" </p><p>over the deficit incurred as a result of increased </p><p>activities of the Investment Center in 2002.  The deficit </p><p>will need to be covered from the Technical Cooperation </p><p>Department\'s budget in 2003. </p><p>4.  Comment and follow-up:  The Annual Report on </p><p>Budgetary Performance and Program and Budgetary </p><p>Performance is transmitted to Council for information. </p><p>The actual transfers will be approved at the September </p><p>2003 FC session. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Agenda Item 4, FAO Interim Accounts.  The FC took </p><p>note of the information provided. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Agenda Item 5, Report on Investments: The Committee </p><p>took note of the report and discussed, in particular: </p><p> </p><p>-- Declining income earnings from investments; </p><p> </p><p>-- The resulting underfunding of staff-related </p><p>liabilities for which long-term portfolio income was </p><p>intended to provide; </p><p> </p><p>-- After a third year of under-performance, the decision </p><p>to terminate the investment manager (Fiduciary Trust) and </p><p> </p><p>seek new managers; </p><p> </p><p>-- The need to increase in-house expertise and monitoring </p><p>capability of FAO\'s investments.  Should FAO move to a </p><p>split-currency assessment, it does not have the in-house </p><p>expertise to handle the monthly spot currency </p><p>transactions that would be required. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Comment and follow-up: See additional discussion of </p><p>after-service medical care liabilities under the Program </p><p>of Work and Budget.  FAO members will need to address the </p><p>fact that liabilities far eclipse the possibility of </p><p>assets addressing them; that assets have been under </p><p>performing badly; and that management of these assets </p><p>poses problems for the organization in terms of the </p><p>number and skills of staff members. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Agenda Item 6, Financial Highlights and status of </p><p>assessed contributions: The Committee took note of the </p><p>report and discussed, in particular: </p><p> </p><p>-- FAO\'s liquidity has significantly improved following </p><p>receipt of U.S. arrears.  (Finance Director Nick Nelson </p><p>noted that the organization was almost forced to resort </p><p>to external borrowing last year as a result of cash-flow </p><p>problems); </p><p> </p><p>-- The shortfall in contributions was higher than last </p><p>year at this time, chiefly because Japan had not yet paid </p><p>its annual contribution. </p><p> </p><p>-- The balance in the Special Reserve Account also </p><p>reflected the positive effects of net favorable currency </p><p>variations in the current biennium (in fact, foreign </p><p>exchange gains amounted to USD 12.6 million and could </p><p>reach USD 20 million by the end of the biennium); </p><p> </p><p>-- The General Fund continued in deficit, and ongoing </p><p>amortization of the unfunded after-service medical care </p><p>liabilities would increase the deficit; </p><p>-- The Technical Cooperation Program (TCP) balance of USD </p><p>81.8 million showed that the rate of TCP expenditure was </p><p>still low; </p><p> </p><p>-- Since FAO\'s management and administrative costs </p><p>related to the Oil for Food (OFF) Program were funded </p><p>entirely through the OFF program, the eventual suspension </p><p>of the OFF program would not affect the Regular Program </p><p>Budget in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Comment and follow-up:  The Financial Highlights are </p><p>transmitted to the FAO Council for information. </p><p> </p><p>II. Oversight Matters </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Agenda Items 7 and 8, 2002 Annual Activity Report of </p><p>the Office of the Inspector General and Progress Report </p><p>on Implementation of the External Auditor\'s </p><p>Recommendations: Inspector General Pete Wilson briefed </p><p>the FC on items 7 and 8.  The FC took note of the Reports </p><p>with the following comments: </p><p> </p><p>-- Welcoming the creation of the Audit Committee and the </p><p>information that staffing in the Finance Division was </p><p>"now satisfactory." </p><p> </p><p>-- Noting the need for more precise timetables for </p><p>implementation of the External Auditor\'s recommendations; </p><p> </p><p>-- Stressing the importance of achieving full and timely </p><p>implementation of the recommendations relating to </p><p>internal controls; </p><p> </p><p>-- Requesting that the review of progress be a standing </p><p>item for the FC. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Comment and follow-up:  The lack of an Audit </p><p>Committee and the need for increased staffing in the </p><p>Finance Division were two of the most important issues </p><p>raised in last year\'s Report of the External Auditor. </p><p> </p><p>The FC should continue to monitor closely the FAO\'s </p><p>follow-up to the 2002 Report of the External Auditor and </p><p>stress full and timely implementation. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Agenda Item 9, Program of Work of the External </p><p>Auditor: The External Auditor explained that the </p><p>Technical Cooperation Program (TCP) had been picked for a </p><p>"value for money" audit.  The rationale included the fact </p><p>that TCP is the third largest program funded by the </p><p>regular budget, and delivery is low; only two percent of </p><p>the current year appropriation had been spent so far and </p><p>decentralization, according to the External Auditor, </p><p>"creates new risks."  The report will be presented in </p><p>2004. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Agenda Item 10, Appointment of the Inspector </p><p>General:  The FC is "consulted" on the appointment of the </p><p>Inspector General (IG).  The FC was informed of the </p><p>selection process and the DG\'s intention to name Ms. </p><p>Amelia Lo Fasso (U.S.) as the new IG on the retirement of </p><p>incumbent Pete Wilson (Canada) in August 2003. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Agenda Item 11, UN Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) </p><p>Reports: The Finance Committee transmitted the JIU </p><p>reports on Water Management and Involvement of Civil </p><p>Society NGO\'s to the Program Committee for action. </p><p> </p><p>-- The FC discussed JIU report 2002/3 on Support Costs </p><p>Related to Extrabudgetary Activities in Organization of </p><p>the UN system.  The Committee welcomed FAO\'s assurance </p><p>that "extrabudgetary resources should only be accepted </p><p>consistent with the policies, aims and activities of the </p><p>organization." </p><p> </p><p>15.  Agenda Item 11, continued, Report on Management and </p><p>Administration in the FAO (JIU/Rep/2002/08): </p><p> </p><p>-- It was noted that FAO management stated that "the </p><p>majority" of the JIU recommendations were being </p><p>implemented.  However, some would need to be submitted to </p><p>the Governing Bodies and others would be considered by </p><p>the Program or Finance Committees.   Members requested </p><p>that FAO provide a follow-up on the implementation of </p><p>recommendations. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Finance Committee is charged with follow-up on </p><p>personnel policies relating to FAO Country and Regional </p><p>Representatives and a proposal that the term of the </p><p>External Auditor be limited.  The September Finance </p><p>Committee will have proposals by FAO management on both </p><p>of these issues. </p><p> </p><p>-- USDel took issue with the FAO Director General\'s </p><p>rejection of the JIU recommendation that selection of </p><p>country and regional representatives should follow </p><p>standard personnel selection procedures.  USDel also </p><p>noted the importance of following up on the JIU </p><p>recommendations on improving management in country and </p><p>regional offices, particularly given the increasing </p><p>decentralization of FAO activities. </p><p> </p><p>16. Comment and follow-up:  In discussion with FAO senior </p><p>staff, USDel was (informally and unofficially) encouraged </p><p>to continue with this message.  It seems that FAO staff </p><p>themselves are all too conscious of the weakness of FAO </p><p>country representatives under the current selection </p><p>process whereby the DG appoints them as his "personal </p><p>representatives." The JIU reports will be transmitted to </p><p>the FAO Council for information. </p><p> </p><p>III. Financial Policy Matters </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  Agenda Item 12, Capital Budgeting: </p><p> </p><p>-- As a result of USDel objections to the proposal on </p><p>capital budgeting, the FC did not endorse the proposal </p><p>and requested the Secretariat to revise the proposal </p><p>without a reserve fund (using only Chapter 8 of the </p><p>Program of Work and Budget); allowing for prior review of </p><p>proposals by the Finance Committee and allowing for </p><p>approval of such proposals by a separate Conference </p><p> </p><p>resolution. </p><p> </p><p>-- Budget Director Tony Wade argued that the FAO proposal </p><p>"offered more accountability than anything in the UN </p><p>system," called attention to WFP\'s recent adoption of a </p><p>capital budgeting mechanism, and argued that FAO - like </p><p>any other large organization or company -- needed a means </p><p>of tracking capital assets. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Comment and follow-up:  We expect that the </p><p>Secretariat will be urging the FC to take a final </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>decision on capital budgeting at the next session. </p><p>Proposed changes to the Financial Regulations will be </p><p>submitted as well in September. </p><p> </p><p>19.  Agenda Item 13, Review of Project Proposals to </p><p>Confirm Compliance with FAO\'s Mandate:  The FC took note </p><p>of the document without discussion. </p><p> </p><p>20.  Agenda Item 14, Proposal to Establish a Special Fund </p><p>for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities: </p><p> </p><p>-- Anne Bauer, Director of FAO\'s emergency programs, </p><p>informed the Committee that the fund was designed to </p><p>speed up FAO\'s response in emergencies; it would not be </p><p>used for procurement of inputs, but for assessment </p><p>missions.  The fund would remain totally outside of the </p><p>regular Program of Work and Budget (PWB) and presented </p><p>"no risk" to the PWB, according to Bauer.  Bauer also </p><p>reported that donors had already expressed interest in </p><p>supporting the Special Fund. </p><p> </p><p>-- The FC supported the proposal, noting that the FAO </p><p>Director General has the authority to establish such a </p><p>fund on his own authority. </p><p> </p><p>21. Innovative Models for Leveraging Resources in Support </p><p>of the Field Program: </p><p> </p><p>-- The FC endorsed the proposed amendment to Financial </p><p>Regulation 6.7, after discussion of the modalities for </p><p>moving responsibility for project execution to national </p><p>authorities.  It was noted that the FAO proposal closely </p><p>tracked that of other UN agencies and programs. </p><p> </p><p>22.  Comment and follow-up: The proposed amendment will </p><p>be submitted to FAO\'s Committee on Constitutional and </p><p>Legal Matters and submitted to the 125th Council for </p><p>transmission to Conference. </p><p> </p><p>23.  Agenda Item 16, Information Note on the Cost of the </p><p>World Food Summit Five Years Later: The FC took note of </p><p>the document without discussion. </p><p> </p><p>IV. Budgetary Matters </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  Agenda Item 17, Summary Program of Work and Budget </p><p>(SPWB) 2004-05: </p><p> </p><p>-- The U.S. and Japan reiterated requests for a zero </p><p>nominal growth scenario; the G-77 members supported a </p><p>real growth scenario, and Switzerland supported a zero </p><p>real growth scenario.  The U.K. was silent. </p><p> </p><p>-- Without prejudice to the overall budget size, the </p><p>Committee considered the cost increase calculations to be </p><p>consistent with the agreed methodology.  The Committee </p><p>also emphasized the importance of resolving amortization </p><p>of the liability for after-service medical care, as </p><p>investment income can no longer cover these costs. </p><p> </p><p>-- Some members expressed the view that the best option </p><p>for amortizing the liability would be to approve the </p><p>Secretariat\'s proposal to include an earmarked USD 14.1 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>million in the PWB starting from 2004-2005 and continuing </p><p>for the subsequent eleven biennia (depending on </p><p>investment performance and subject to actuarial </p><p>recalculation). </p><p> </p><p>25.  Comment and Follow-up:  Among the items on which the </p><p>FC agreed to take a decision in the September Finance </p><p> </p><p>Committee is how to handle amortization of unfunded </p><p>liabilities associated with after-service medical costs. </p><p>The Secretariat will prepare a paper on the subject. </p><p>Concerning the final budget level, we do not expect the </p><p>September Finance Committee to come to any conclusion </p><p>(nor in fact for a decision to be reached until the </p><p>November/December Conference.) The Summary Program of </p><p>Work and Budget will also be transmitted to the FAO </p><p>Council session. </p><p> </p><p>26.  Agenda item 18, Split Assessments: </p><p> </p><p>-- As a result of USDel objections, the Committee did not </p><p>endorse the Secretariat\'s proposed methodology for a </p><p>split currency assessment (SCA). USDel argued that split </p><p>assessment was burdensome for members and that the FAO </p><p>should be responsible for managing its resources in the </p><p>economic environment in which it operated.  USDel also </p><p>argued that the proposed methodology lacked transparency, </p><p>as adjustments would be made automatically between </p><p>biennia for exchange rate fluctuations. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Secretariat was requested to prepare an additional </p><p>methodology that protected the PWB against exchange rate </p><p>fluctuations within the biennium, but not between biennia </p><p>"and to compare this with the Secretariat\'s methodology." </p><p> </p><p>-- UKDel stated that the U.S. position raised an </p><p>important question which needed to be examined by the UK </p><p>authorities; that being said, UKDel confirmed that he in </p><p>fact agreed to the need to protect the budget from </p><p>exchange rate fluctuations within and between biennia. </p><p>The UK also stated that there was no significant </p><p>additional burden in paying in two currencies. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Delegate of Pakistan stated that he supported the </p><p>principle that the budget should be protected both </p><p>between as well as within biennia.  He agreed that the </p><p>Finance Committee could look at the question again, but </p><p>cautioned that the Committee "should not become </p><p>deadlocked." </p><p> </p><p>-- A number of countries pursued the question of whether </p><p>Euro-zone countries should provide the Euro portion of </p><p>any split currency assessment, arguing that the exchange </p><p>rate "risk" should be transferred to those countries best </p><p>positioned to handle the risk.  The Secretariat responded </p><p>that those countries only provided 38.48 percent of the </p><p>budget (whereas the FAO\'s Euro needs represent some 44 </p><p>percent of the budget). </p><p> </p><p>-- The Delegate of Tanzania stated that payment in two </p><p>currencies could add to the burden of developing </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p>-- Budget Director Tony Wade noted that the proposed </p><p>methodology closely resembled that of the IAEA and </p><p>UNESCO, except that the exchange rate was more realistic </p><p>(both of those organizations use an old exchange rate </p><p>which, according to Wade, "distorts" the calculations.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Wade also argued that failure to approve a split </p><p>currency assessment left the organization in danger of </p><p>having to absorb exchange rate losses in the next </p><p>biennium - which would require cutting some 500 </p><p>positions.  He noted that he could wait "until September </p><p>or October" to get a final ok on the SCA, but that if the </p><p>organization were not to have one, he would have </p><p>considered "buying forward today." </p><p> </p><p>27. Comment and follow-up:  USDel was also requested to </p><p>prepare a non-paper to circulate to FC members on the </p><p>subject.  The Committee also agreed that the issue needed </p><p>to be resolved no later than the September Finance </p><p>Committee session in view of the preparations that the </p><p>Secretariat would need to make to prepare the budget and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the Secretariat for the next biennium.  Of the nine FC </p><p>members present, probably one other member (UK) </p><p>thoroughly understood the issue.  We expect the </p><p>Secretariat to push very hard for member approval of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>their original proposal.  The Finance Committee\'s </p><p>conclusions (or lack thereof) on the split currency </p><p> </p><p>assessment will be transmitted to the Council. </p><p> </p><p>28.  Agenda Item 19, Scale of Contributions 2004-05: </p><p> </p><p>-- As expected, Chile, on behalf of Argentina, requested </p><p>that Argentina\'s assessment be reduced. </p><p> </p><p>-- It was noted that this would require other members to </p><p>meet the difference.  A few members suggested that </p><p>postponing payments was the normal option. </p><p> </p><p>-- The FC agreed to the proposed scale of assessments for </p><p>forwarding to the Council and took note (but no action) </p><p>on the Argentine request. </p><p> </p><p>29. Comment and follow-up: We expect that Argentina may </p><p>request another Latin American country to raise this </p><p>issue again at Council (Argentina has lost its seat on </p><p>the Council as a result of arrears).  The Council must </p><p>adopt the proposed scale of assessments. </p><p> </p><p>30.  Agenda Items 20, 21, 22, Budget for the European </p><p>Commission for Control of Food and Mouth Disease; for the </p><p>Regional Animal Production and Health Commission for Asia </p><p>and the Pacific; and for the Desert Locust Commission: </p><p>The FC took note of the reports with minimal discussion. </p><p> </p><p>V.  Human Resources Management </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>31.  Agenda Item 23, Progress Report on Human Resources </p><p>Management:  The FC took note of the progress report </p><p>without discussion. </p><p> </p><p>32.  Agenda Item 24, Statistics of Personnel Services: </p><p>The FC took note of the document without discussion. </p><p> </p><p>33.  Agenda Item 25, Annual Reports of the ICSC and UN </p><p>Joint Staff Pension Board to the General Assembly and </p><p>Summary of the Decisions Taken:  The FC took note of the </p><p>document without discussion. </p><p> </p><p>VI. Organizational Matters </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>34.  Agenda Item 26, Methodology for Determination of </p><p>Equitable Geographic Distribution: </p><p> </p><p>-- USDel pointed out that the Secretariat paper had </p><p>incorrectly described the methodology in use by the </p><p>United Nations in New York for determining geographical </p><p>distribution in preparing the two "alternatives" for FC </p><p>consideration.  USDel also noted that any methodology was </p><p>only as effective as management chose to make it. </p><p> </p><p>--Other FC members stated that they needed to know how </p><p>the alternatives proposed would affect their countries. </p><p> </p><p>--Pakistan noted that the Secretariat\'s proposal did not </p><p>address regional distribution, and noted in this regard </p><p>what he called the "severe" underrepresentation of the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p>-- USDel stated that there were no agreed criteria for </p><p>regional distribution and that the U.S. would not support </p><p>creating a methodology for geographic distribution which </p><p>took into account regional distribution. </p><p> </p><p>-- Japan argued that consistency with other UN agencies </p><p>was desirable.  Other members supported, in principle, a </p><p>methodology similar to that in use in New York, which </p><p>takes into account population and contributions. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Delegate of Pakistan stated that "the current </p><p>system of linking representation to contributions is in </p><p>general not acceptable." </p><p> </p><p>-- The Secretariat will revise the paper to correct the </p><p>mistake; the item will be taken up again at the September </p><p>FC. </p><p>35.  Follow-up and comment:  FC members requested that </p><p> </p><p>the item not be discussed in the meantime at the Council </p><p>(where it appears on the agenda). The proposal to review </p><p>the methodology for determining geographic distribution </p><p>was first proposed by the Latin American and Caribbean </p><p>region; while the membership as a whole has never agreed </p><p>to change the methodology, discussion is kept alive by </p><p>the fact that everyone has something to dislike about the </p><p>current system.  Any change to the system should require </p><p>the Secretariat to make better efforts to increase </p><p>representation of underrepresented countries (for </p><p>instance, by not accepting applications from candidates </p><p>from overrepresented countries). </p><p> </p><p>36.  Agenda Item 27, Progress Report on the Oracle </p><p>Project:  The FC took note of the paper without </p><p>discussion. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>37.  The agenda for the upcoming FC session in September </p><p>contains a number of complicated but important financial </p><p>issues, all of which must, in one form or another, be </p><p>acted upon by the Committee.  We expect the Secretariat </p><p>to push strongly for a Split Currency Assessment </p><p>methodology which automatically protects the FAO budget </p><p>between biennia; we expect the Secretariat to similarly </p><p>push for agreement on a capital budgeting mechanism.  And </p><p>we expect that the Secretariat will push hard for a real </p><p>growth budget (although this is likely to be postponed </p><p>for final action to the November/December Conference, as </p><p>was the case in 2001).  Concerning follow-up to the </p><p>recommendations of the JIU report and that of the </p><p>External Auditor, the FC must be persevering in insisting </p><p>on full reporting on follow-up and not lose sight of </p><p>these important management issues, despite the heavy </p><p>workload of the Committee sessions.
