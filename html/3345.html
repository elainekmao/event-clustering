<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003600 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, IT, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: FRATTINI TO BE NAMED ITALY\'S NEW FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DCM THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON JULY 19, PAOLO DIONISI, DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR </p><p>TO PM AND ACTING FM BERLUSCONI, INFORMED CDA THAT BERLUSCONI </p><p>PLANS TO ANNOUNCE ITALY\'S NEW FM AT THE END OF THE JULY 24-26 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03600  221426Z </p><p>CONFERENCE OF ITALIAN AMBASSADORS TO BE HELD IN ROME.  THE </p><p>NEW FM, ACCORDING TO DIONISI, WILL BE FRANCO FRATTINI, </p><p>CURRENTLY MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO FOR PUBLIC </p><p>ADMINISTRATION AND THE INTELLIGENCE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE NEW ITALIAN MFA WILL FOLLOW THE CANADIAN MODEL, </p><p>EXPLAINED DIONISI.  IT WILL BE CALLED THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS AND TRADE.  HOWEVER, IT WILL HAVE ONLY ONE MINISTER, </p><p>FRATTINI, WHO NOT ONLY KNOWS PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WELL BUT </p><p>IS ALSO VERY CLOSE TO BERLUSCONI AND HIS DIPLOMATIC ADVISORS. </p><p> ADOLFO URSO, CURRENTLY DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PRODUCTIVE </p><p>ACTIVITIES, WILL BECOME THE DEPUTY MINISTER AT MFA WITH </p><p>ESSENTIALLY THE SAME RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROMOTING FOREIGN </p><p>TRADE THAT HE CURRENTLY HAS. (NOTE: IN HIS MOVE FROM THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES TO THE MFA, URSO WILL BRING </p><p>WITH HIM HIS ENTIRE ORGANIZATION, PREVIOUSLY THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>FOREIGN TRADE.  END NOTE.)  FRATTINI\'S CHIEF OF STAFF WILL BE </p><p>CESARE RAGAGLINI, CURRENTLY BERLUSCONI\'S DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ADVISOR.  WITH FRATTINI AS FM, RELATIONS BETWEEN THE MFA AND </p><p>PALAZZO CHIGI (THE PM\'S OFFICE) WILL BE EXCELLENT, STRESSED </p><p>DIONISI.  HE ADDED THAT PALAZZO CHIGI DIPLOMATIC STAFF WILL </p><p>EXPAND TO MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLE THE FUNCTIONS OF THE US </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WITH GIOVANNI CASTELLANETA, </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR, REMAINING TO HEAD THE </p><p>EXPANDED ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT: EVEN AFTER ANNOUNCING FRATTINI\'S APPOINTMENT, </p><p>WE EXPECT BERLUSCONI, WHO HAS BEEN ACTING FM FOR EIGHT </p><p>MONTHS, TO CONTINUE TO PLAY THE LEAD ROLE IN SHAPING ITALY\'S </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY.  BERLUSCONI, IN CHOOSING A TRUSTED ADVISER </p><p>FROM HIS OWN FORZA ITALIA PARTY AS FM, SEEKS TO ENSURE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03600  221426Z </p><p>END OF SQUABBLES BETWEEN PALAZZO CHIGI AND THE MFA THAT ITALY </p><p>EXPERIENCED UNDER FM RUGGIERO, AND LESS FREQUENTLY SINCE </p><p>RUGGIERO\'S RESIGNATION IN JANUARY.  NO DOUBT FRATTINI WILL BE </p><p>AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN SHAPING ITALY\'S FOREIGN POLICY, BUT </p><p>HE WILL ALSO BE EXPECTED TO ENSURE THAT THE MFA EXECUTES </p><p>FOREIGN AND TRADE POLICY DESIGNED BY BERLUSCONI AND PALAZZO </p><p>CHIGI.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) POST WILL FOLLOW UP WITH BIOGRAPHIC DETAIL ON </p><p>FRATTINI. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03600 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
