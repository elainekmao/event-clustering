<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005331 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, PTER, ETRD, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PEACE AIRPORT REVIVED? ISRAELI-JORDANIAN OFFICIALS </p><p>CONFER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On the heels of an Israeli government decision to </p><p>prohibit jets from using Eilat Airport, officials from the </p><p>Jordanian and Israeli Civil Aviation authorities, Israeli </p><p>Ministry of Transportation, Eilat and Aqaba Airport </p><p>officials, and the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority </p><p>(ASEZA) Chief Commissioner met September 11 to discuss </p><p>options regarding the use of Aqaba International Airport for </p><p>previously Eilat-bound traffic.  Although the first meeting </p><p>was, in the words of one participant, a "brainstorming </p><p>session", the plan could lead to the revival of the concept </p><p>of a "Peace Airport" on the Israeli-Jordanian border and </p><p>would be a shot in the arm for regional peacemaking efforts. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>AN IDEAL SOLUTION </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Hanna Najjar, Director of the Jordanian Civil </p><p>Aviation Authority (CAA) filled us in on the September 11 </p><p>meeting that included Director General Amos Amir of the </p><p>Israeli Civil Aviation Authority, the head of Israeli CAA </p><p>International Relations, Arkia Israel Airlines CEO Israel </p><p>Borovich, Omar al-Manha, Director of the Aqaba International </p><p>Airport, ASEZA Chief Commissioner Akel Biltaji, Robert </p><p>Burnett, Project Manager for Bechtel, and Najjar.  Najjar </p><p>told us that, under pressure from the Israeli Green Party, </p><p>the Israeli Government has decided to prohibit jets from </p><p>landing at Eilat Airport effective November 1.  Israeli </p><p>Greens have long called for closing the airport, located in </p><p>the center of the city of 48,000, as an environmental, </p><p>safety, and noise hazard. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Najjar said the decision prompted the Israeli </p><p>officials to return to the "Peace Airport" idea: the use of </p><p>Aqaba International Airport, just on the other side of the </p><p>Israeli-Jordanian border and only 6 km from downtown Eilat, </p><p>as an alternative landing site for flights of the Israeli </p><p>domestic carrier Arkia.  (Note: The eventual building of a </p><p>joint Eilat-Aqaba airport, known as the Peace Airport, was </p><p>outlined in the 1994 Jordanian-Israeli Peace Treaty.  A </p><p>four-month trial period in 1997, in which some Israeli </p><p>flights landed at Aqaba, failed due to insufficient numbers </p><p>of passengers and lack of interest on the part of El Al, the </p><p>Israeli state airline, according to al-Manha.  This idea </p><p>differs from the original Peace Airport scheme in that Aqaba </p><p>would only be used, at least initially, by domestic Israeli </p><p>Arkia flights. End Note.)  Aqaba International can </p><p>accommodate any size aircraft, having taken 747s, C-130s, </p><p>Tupelovs, and even the Concorde.  The grounds of the airport </p><p>itself border Israeli territory.  Ouvda Airport, which now </p><p>serves Eilat with all international service, is an </p><p>unattractive alternative at 45 minutes away. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>WHAT WE CAN DO ONCE WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The brainstorming session, said Najjar, produced a </p><p>number of options.  Busses could take passengers directly to </p><p>the Aqaba-Eilat border crossing.  A new apron, to be used </p><p>exclusively for Arkia flights, could be constructed adjacent </p><p>to the Israeli side of the runway with a short road running </p><p>directly to Israeli territory through airport property. </p><p>Alternately, the airport boundary, which currently runs along </p><p>the road to the border crossing, could be extended to include </p><p>the existing road and the crossing.  (In which case, the </p><p>Aqaba authorities would be prepared to build a new road for </p><p>ordinary traffic.  In any event, all the ideas foresee the </p><p>direct transfer of domestic Israeli passengers from the </p><p>airport to Israeli territory without border or other </p><p>controls.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) While the talks, which included a briefing for the </p><p>Israelis on projects and progress in the ASEZ, went well, </p><p>Najjar said the Israelis agreed to take the ideas back to </p><p>Israel.  Al-Manha was enthusiastic.  He said it was an </p><p>"excellent" meeting, and that his Israeli colleagues, whom he </p><p>said he speaks to regularly, believe this to be a "great </p><p>opportunity".  Al-Manha said, "This could be an excellent </p><p>example for the international community of what we can do </p><p>once we put our heads together." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In the fashion of QIZs and the recent joint </p><p>agreement to cooperate on Dead Sea environmental issues, a </p><p>revival of the Peace Airport, in whatever form, would be yet </p><p>another instance of Jordanian-Israeli cooperation.  Once </p><p>Israeli security concerns are addressed, the project, in its </p><p>most basic form, needs little investment in time or money to </p><p>move forward.  We believe success in this limited venture </p><p>should be encouraged, and may lead to a re-examination of the </p><p>original Peace Airport plan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
