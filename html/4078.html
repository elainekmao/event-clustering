<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002339 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EFIN, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY: PATIENT IS ON LIFE SUPPORT, </p><p>BUT COULD HANG ON FOR YEARS... </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary:  Ambassador Sullivan and the </p><p>economic/commercial section hosted a group of </p><p>American-connected businessmen for lunch on October 23 as a </p><p>first step towards resurrecting an American Business </p><p>Association.  Although the mission expected to hear the usual </p><p>commentary about an economy in decline, the discussion </p><p>revealed surprising strength in some sectors of the </p><p>beleaguered business community.  However, regardless of how </p><p>well those who remain within the formal economy are coping </p><p>with the current situation, the formal economy no longer </p><p>represents the majority of workers or businesses, and the </p><p>impact of the current economic crisis is falling </p><p>disproportionately on those at the lower end of the economic </p><p>scale.  Although "captains of industry" can still enjoy a </p><p>lavish lunch at the finest restaurant in the country for less </p><p>than US $5 per head, hundreds of thousands of </p><p>poverty-stricken people in the rural areas are coming to </p><p>grips with the approaching famine.  While some people will </p><p>undoubtedly continue to flourish, they remain a fraction of </p><p>the population as a whole. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>WHAT ECONOMIC STATISTICS MAY OVERLOOK </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  The discussion began with an unexpected assertion by </p><p>a representative of a Big 5 accounting firm who declared that </p><p>despite the negative press image, many Zimbabwean businesses </p><p>were reaping phenomenal profits.  He pointed out that the </p><p>profit ratio for many businesses had increased by as much as </p><p>300%, and opined that if the economy was simply an aggregate </p><p>of businesses, it was doing much better than the raw economic </p><p>data portrayed.  He painted a picture of an economy which </p><p>could continue to function -- although mostly in the informal </p><p>sector -- for years. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>STILL, MANY FIRMS HURTING </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  This surprising opening gambit was met with </p><p>skepticism by several of the more commodity-dependent </p><p>businessmen.  One representative from a major oil company </p><p>pointed out that controlled prices were crippling producers </p><p>and distributors.  Gasoline, for instance, is currently sold </p><p>for Zim $74 per liter, which equals about US $.23 per gallon. </p><p> As one attendee pointed out, petrol is not only cheaper in </p><p>Zimbabwe than in any other country in the world, it is also </p><p>currently cheaper than bottled water.  Another added that the </p><p>people in the rural areas could afford neither petrol nor </p><p>bottled water.  Many of the businessmen were aware that their </p><p>products -- from cooking oil to toothpaste -- were being </p><p>bought at controlled prices within Zimbabwe and then re-sold </p><p>for higher prices in other countries within the region. </p><p>Although this increase in sales would seem to boost the </p><p>company\'s earnings in the short term, many of the companies </p><p>are in essence competing with themselves, and are losing </p><p>higher-priced sales in the adjoining countries. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Another attendee countered the Big 5 accountant by </p><p>noting that commodity-based businesses were facing additional </p><p>hurdles.  While controlled prices negatively affected his </p><p>business as well, he felt that the eroding value of the Zim </p><p>dollar, increasing labor problems and strangling limitations </p><p>on forex were more significant issues.  This attendee </p><p>rebutted the claim of 300% profits by pointing out that in US </p><p>dollar terms, even allowing for inflation, the profits for </p><p>this year could not command the same purchasing power as one </p><p>year ago.  He also felt that labor issues, many of them based </p><p>on the erosion of the Zim dollar which is hitting hourly </p><p>workers particularly hard, were affecting not only his bottom </p><p>line but also the productivity of his labor force.  He </p><p>narrated an incident wherein several of his company\'s </p><p>managers were held hostage in their plant for hours by a </p><p>group of employees dissatisfied with a voluntary raise which </p><p>had been unilaterally granted by management.  The angry </p><p>workers defied orders to disperse from the plant security </p><p>force, from their union representatives, and from the police </p><p>for several hours.  Although the situation was resolved in </p><p>the end, this manager believed that labor throughout the </p><p>entire country would become more and more militant during the </p><p>coming twelve months.  Finally, he believed that the virtual </p><p>absence of foreign exchange would continue to strangle </p><p>businesses across the board. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  The scarcity of foreign exchange continues to be a </p><p>key problem for most of the businesses represented.  Almost </p><p>every producer of commodities present was dependent on forex </p><p>to some degree.  Some required forex to buy components for </p><p>their products, to buy spare parts for their operating </p><p>equipment and delivery fleets, and to pay for international </p><p>shipping costs or contingency inputs not available on the </p><p>local market.   Several of the representatives admitted </p><p>openly that they are sourcing their forex on the parallel </p><p>market, which inevitably increases pressure on profitability. </p><p> The parallel market is in constant flux and the rate </p><p>responds to the demand for forex on any given day.  One </p><p>manufacturer pointed out that he recently received forex </p><p>quotes ranging from 950:1 to 1200:1 on a single day.  While </p><p>he could justify sourcing forex at the higher rate for his </p><p>higher-end luxury products, which some consumers would </p><p>purchase at any price, that rate would put his lower-end </p><p>necessity products out of the reach of most of his customers. </p><p> In many cases, manufacturers are simply proceeding on an ad </p><p>hoc basis with minimal short-term planning and almost no </p><p>long-term planning at all. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>HOW ZIMBABWEANS AND LOCAL FIRMS SURVIVE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  The Big 5 accountant asserted that most businessmen </p><p>have figured out how to circumvent the forex problems, and </p><p>several attendees conceded that they were "managing."  One </p><p>representative from a large multinational stated that he was </p><p>manipulating his foreign currency account -- which normally </p><p>requires that 40% of revenue from exports be forfeited to the </p><p>government at the official 55:1 exchange rate -- in order to </p><p>keep 100% of his foreign exchange income.  He had to have </p><p>several separate pieces of enabling paperwork signed by GOZ </p><p>officials, but it seems obvious that they do not understand </p><p>what he is doing.   As he stated, what he is doing is not </p><p>illegal, but it is not recognized by the government, and he </p><p>is reluctant to bring much attention to his situation. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) In a separate forex-related discussion, one </p><p>representative stated in an aside to the Ambassador and the </p><p>Laboff that he was stunned at the amount of forex "floating" </p><p>around the country.  He said at least two politically </p><p>well-connected contacts had indicated they had large amounts </p><p>of US cash to dispose of.  One contact had called him trying </p><p>to exchange US $500,000 in cash into Zim dollars.  When asked </p><p>if he thought the current pressure emanating from </p><p>international press reports on diamond-and-cash smuggling </p><p>from the DRC was responsible for the glut of US cash, the </p><p>representative stated he would not be surprised if this was </p><p>the case. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  One of the more surprising discussions revolved </p><p>around expatriate foreign cash inflow.  One representative </p><p>estimated a cash inflow of around 12 million pounds monthly </p><p>from expats sending home 200-300 British pounds each to their </p><p>families in Zimbabwe.  Another responded that even with the </p><p>GOZ claiming 40% from established Zimbabwean foreign currency </p><p>accounts, the GOZ is probably only capturing around Brit </p><p>200,000 pounds of this inflow per month.  Another attendee </p><p>mentioned companies such as Sadza.com, an amazing </p><p>entrepreneurial response to the crisis in Zimbabwe. </p><p>According to this attendee, Sadza.com will accept money in </p><p>British pounds or US dollars, issue a "coupon" for Zim </p><p>dollars, and then deliver that "coupon" to people inside </p><p>Zimbabwe, who can in turn use the credit to buy groceries and </p><p>other commodities.  Yet another attendee related stories of </p><p>professional nurses turning part-time work in the U.K. into </p><p>full-time luxury back home.  A nurse, who could not earn </p><p>enough to support her family by working in Zimbabwe, can earn </p><p>enough by working as a nursing assistant in the U.K. for one </p><p>month to support her family back home for four months.  Thus, </p><p>for one month\'s labor, the nurse could pay for the round-trip </p><p>ticket, stay for one month in the U.K., and then live a life </p><p>of ease for three more months in Zimbabwe.  Many in the group </p><p>felt certain that support from Zimbabwe\'s many professional </p><p>expatriates could continue to keep the remnants of the local </p><p>economy afloat for years. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U)  Despite the fact that some urban residents are </p><p>managing to survive on foreign cash inflows and creative </p><p>business methods, the vast majority in the rural areas and </p><p>high density suburbs are becoming more desperate by the day. </p><p>Drawing upon impressions from visits to rural areas, the </p><p>Ambassador suggested that the grinding poverty and hunger </p><p>were spreading, a sentiment quickly acknowledged by the group </p><p>as a whole and which is particularly affecting the "low-end" </p><p>consumer market.  This divide between relative comfort and </p><p>abject poverty will inevitably widen during the coming months </p><p>unless the GOZ commits to radical economic surgery.  Although </p><p>providers of necessities and luxuries might hold out the </p><p>longest, the economy\'s contraction is very real. </p><p>Unemployment is high, numerous businesses have closed down </p><p>during the past two years, and, in contrast to professionals </p><p>who have the skills to flee the country, many of the </p><p>unskilled are trapped in an increasingly impoverished </p><p>Zimbabwe.  One of the shocks for many Zimbabweans is not how </p><p>bad the economy is now, but how far it has fallen from </p><p>several years ago, when Zimbabwe was the "jewel of Africa." </p><p>Few anticipate that it will improve in the short term, but </p><p>even fewer think it has yet reached the bottom.  Nobody wants </p><p>to acknowledge that countries like Somalia, Sierra Leone, and </p><p>the DRC continue to "function," despite having economies even </p><p>worse off than Zimbabwe\'s.  Many businessmen -- as evidenced </p><p>by this group representing American business interests -- </p><p>believe the economy can continue to limp along for years, </p><p>with at least some people maintaining their lifestyle.  Many, </p><p>however, will fall through the widening cracks and lose </p><p>forever their place among the middle class. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
