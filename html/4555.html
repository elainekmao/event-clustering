<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 005177 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA, NEA/FO </p><p> </p><p>E.O 12958: DECL: 12/01/12 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, IZ, US, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) GOK URGES US/SCIRI CONTACTS, WITH SOME </p><p>RESERVATIONS </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Kuwait 05116 </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reason 1.5 </p><p>(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  After a November 25 meeting with Codel </p><p>Issa and the Ambassador, Kuwait\'s Minstate for Foreign </p><p>Affairs offered to facilitate a meeting between the Codel </p><p>and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in </p><p>Iraq\'s (SCIRI\'s) Chairman Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim and </p><p>suggested it might be time for the GOK to allow a SCIRI office in </p><p>Kuwait.  However, another senior official later ruled this </p><p>out as contrary to a firm GOK policy against hosting </p><p>offices of groups opposing any country.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a meeting between Codel Issa and First Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmed </p><p>Al-Sabah on Nov. 25, conversation focused partially on the </p><p>Iraqi oppositionist group SCIRI.  Shaykh Sabah told the </p><p>Codel that SCIRI leader Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim was in </p><p>Kuwait City and had overcome his hesitancy to speak with </p><p>U.S. officials and other Iraqi opposition groups.  Shaykh </p><p>Sabah claimed there was no opposition leader with a </p><p>stronger dislike for Saddam than al-Hakim, many members of </p><p>whose family had been murdered by the Iraqi leader.  He </p><p>also stated that SCIRI has the largest and most credible </p><p>opposition force on the ground in southern Iraq, and, </p><p>referring to SCIRI\'s Badr Corps, a "brigade" that could be </p><p>sent into Iraq if Iran allows it. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) After the meeting, Minstate for Foreign Affairs, </p><p>Shaykh Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah, who had served as Shaykh </p><p>Sabah\'s interpreter during the meeting, approached Rep. </p><p>Darrell Issa (R-CA) and offered to arrange a meeting </p><p>between al-Hakim and the Codel.  Issa had to decline the </p><p>offer due to time constraints.  Noting that al-Hakim had </p><p>declined a request to meet separately with Rep. Dana </p><p>Rohrabacher (R-CA) just two days earlier, the Ambassador </p><p>asked Dr. Mohammed what had changed.  Dr. Mohammed replied </p><p>that the GOK had explained to Hakim that "he made a very </p><p>big mistake" in turning down the request. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In response to a question by the Ambassador, Shaykh </p><p>Dr. Mohammed confirmed that no Iraqi opposition group </p><p>currently has an office in Kuwait and said that it might be </p><p>time to explore the opening of a SCIRI office here, or at </p><p>least more regular visits by SCIRI officials (Reftel). </p><p>Nonetheless, in a subsequent meeting on Nov. 26, Minister </p><p>of Amiri Diwan Shaykh Nasser Mohammed al-Sabah affirmed </p><p>that Kuwait has never and would never host offices for </p><p>exile groups opposing any country, not even Iraq.  As a </p><p>small country relying on the good will of the international </p><p>community for its survival, this would be contrary to its </p><p>own national interests. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment:  Although Kuwait\'s support of al-Hakim is </p><p>widely known, the urgency with which Dr. Mohammed made the </p><p>offer indicates that Kuwait feels very strongly that SCIRI </p><p>should be involved now in planning future activity in Iraq. </p><p>Twice in the twenty-four hours preceding the meeting with </p><p>Shaykh Sabah, National Assembly Speaker Jassem al-Khorafi </p><p>also offered to facilitate a meeting of American officials </p><p>with al-Hakim.  However, Nasser Mohammed\'s comments suggest </p><p>that Kuwait still prefers to maintain plausible deniability </p><p>for its support of opposition groups.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) This cable has not been cleared by Codel Issa. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
