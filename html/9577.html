WRIGHT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, TU, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT </p><p>TUESDAY, JULY 22, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THIS REPORT WILL PRESENT A TURKISH PRESS SUMMARY UNDER </p><p>THREE THEMES: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p>BRIEFING </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>HEADLINES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MASS APPEAL </p><p>Wolfowitz warns Iraq\'s neighbors not to intervene - </p><p>Hurriyet </p><p>Iraqi peacekeeping tough mission for Turkey - Turkiye </p><p>AKP discusses new decree for troop deployment - </p><p>Hurriyet </p><p>Erdogan: U.S. wants Turkish troops for Iraq - Sabah </p><p>Talabani objects to Turkish troops in N.

Turkish forces in </p><p>Northern Iraq will maintain their positions.  The </p><p>Turkish troops will stay in Iraq for at least three </p><p>years.  Ankara wanted to send troops to Northern Iraq, </p><p>but the U.S. prefers for the Turks to be in the most </p><p>troubled Iraqi cities.  PUK leader Talabani said on </p><p>Monday that the Turks have attempted to remove the </p><p>federal administration and the Kurdish parliament in </p><p>Northern Iraq, and he voiced strong objection to a </p><p>Turkish military presence in the north.  Ruling AKP </p><p>deputies, disturbed by the Suleymaniye arrests, are </p><p>reluctant to send soldiers to Iraq.  Some AKP lawmakers </p><p>told the press that the parliament would be unwilling </p><p>to approve a motion to that end.  "Hurriyet" thinks </p><p>that because of the opposition by a large number of AKP </p><p>deputies, the government is planning to use the March </p><p>20 motion endorsed by the parliament to send soldiers </p><p>to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FM Gul to U.S.: Turkey\'s contribution to Iraqi </p><p>peacekeeping, unofficially discussed in Ankara through </p><p>military channels last week, will be the top issue </p><p>during Foreign Minister Gul\'s calls in Washington this </p><p>week.  Gul and Secretary Powell are expected to </p><p>announce political aspects of U.S.-Turkish cooperation </p><p>after a meeting on July 24.  Cyprus, the Arab-Israeli </p><p>conflict, and the struggle against terrorism will be </p><p>other issues of discussion during the Gul visit. </p><p>"Sabah" expects Gul to offer a helping hand to U.S. </p><p>efforts to ensure stability in Iraq in exchange for a </p><p>continuation of Turkey\'s military presence in Northern </p><p>Iraq. </p><p>Ankara did not respond to $1 billion grant offer: U.S. </p><p>Ambassador to Ankara W. Robert Pearson said on Monday </p><p>that Ankara has not yet responded to the U.S offer of </p><p>$1 billion in grants to compensate Turkey\'s losses for </p><p>the Iraqi campaign.  Pearson told "Hurriyet" that </p><p>Washington had presented to Ankara a draft agreement </p><p>about the aid last month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gallup shows decline in support for U.S.: "Vatan" </p><p>carries a Gallup survey conducted between April 16 and </p><p>May 8 in 45 countries.  64 percent of Turks disapprove </p><p>of the Iraq war.  75 percent regard the U.S. as an </p><p>aggressor and a threat for the world.  Only 13 percent </p><p>of Turks see the U.S. as a friend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Syrian PM due in Ankara: Papers report that Syrian </p><p>Prime Minister Mustafa Miro will be in Ankara next </p><p>week, the first official visit between the two </p><p>countries in 17 years.  Miro will discuss with Turkish </p><p>leaders issues including Iraq, the struggle against </p><p>terrorism, economic cooperation, and border security. </p><p>Miro\'s meetings might pave the way for a visit by the </p><p>Syrian head of state, Bashar Assad, this fall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Iraq/WMD controversy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkish troops to Iraq" </p><p>Fehmi Koru argued in the Islamist-intellectual (7/22): </p><p>"Sending Turkish troops to Iraq has once again been </p><p>brought onto the agenda; this is like the resurrection </p><p>of a big mistake.  The US is trying to share with </p><p>others the responsibility of being an occupying force </p><p>in Iraq.  India and France have already said `no\' to </p><p>Washington, and there is no reason for Turkey to act </p><p>differently.  It seems that the US has realized the </p><p>emerging impasse with respect to its position in Iraq, </p><p>and there is no need to make it more complicated.  The </p><p>best thing is to arrange a calendar to schedule the </p><p>departure of the occupation forces from Iraq, and hand </p><p>over the responsibility to the UN.  It is certain that </p><p>the Iraqis would treat a UN peacekeeping force better </p><p>than they do the Americans.  At that stage, Turkey </p><p>could join a UN peacekeeping force and also contribute </p><p>to Iraq\'s political restructuring.  Otherwise, dragging </p><p>Turkey into the a military swamp is not going to serve </p><p>US interests, either." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The death of Dr. Kelly" </p><p>Turgut Tarhanli wrote in the liberal-intellectual </p><p>Radikal (7/22): "If the David Kelly case turns out to </p><p>be a suicide, an explanation from the Blair </p><p>Government\'s is in the interest not only of the UK, but </p><p>the whole world. . The Kelly event and the emerging </p><p>facts about the distortion of intelligence on Iraq\'s </p><p>weapons of mass destruction clearly indicate an </p><p>aggressive foreign policy on the part of the US and the </p><p>UK.  The US remains in confusion over the intelligence </p><p>reports about alleged WMD, and the controversy </p><p>continues on the political level.  The issue has now </p><p>reached a new level in the UK with the tragic death of </p><p>Dr. Kelly." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
