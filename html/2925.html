<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002329 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>State for NEA/PPD (MLUSSENHOP, CBOURGEOIS), NEA/ARN, </p><p>IBB FOR GARY THATCHER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KMDR, JO, KPAO </p><p>SUBJECT:  IBB\'s Radio Sawa an initial hit among the </p><p>youth in Jordan </p><p> </p><p>1.   (Summary) The experimental broadcast of IBB\'s </p><p>Radio Sawa, which offers an attractive mix of Arabic </p><p>and American music, became an instant hit among </p><p>Jordan\'s young, who are the main target audience and </p><p>the majority of the population.  Whether this </p><p>popularity will continue now that Radio Sawa has </p><p>started news and feature broadcasting remains to be </p><p>seen.  There is a widespread misconception that </p><p>Radio Sawa is a private enterprise and not a U.S. </p><p>government broadcast. (End summary) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Music attracts youth </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>2.   As early as the experimental broadcasting </p><p>stage, the attractive mix of Arabic and American </p><p>music broadcast on IBB\'s Radio Sawa became an </p><p>instant hit among Jordan\'s youth who are the </p><p>majority of the population in this country.  The </p><p>diversity of Radio Sawa\'s audience appears to </p><p>transcend wealth and education barriers, since the </p><p>radio can be heard in modest taxicabs and </p><p>barbershops, fast food establishments such as Burger </p><p>King, as well as plush health fitness clubs. </p><p>Whether Radio Sawa\'s popularity will continue now </p><p>that more extensive news coverage will be aired on </p><p>the station remains to be seen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Not to be too sanguine </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>3.   The success of the experimental broadcast </p><p>should not be confused with support for the U.S. </p><p>The conviction that U.S. Middle East policy is </p><p>biased against the Arabs remains strong in Jordan </p><p>and it gives rise to strong feelings of injustice </p><p>and anger.  A PA contact said that a shop which he </p><p>frequents was playing Radio Sawa not realizing that </p><p>it was an American station.  When this was explained </p><p>to him he immediately changed to another station. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Cynicism regarding news broadcasts </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>4.   Centrist, influential among the elite, the </p><p>English daily Jordan Times reported on April 30 that </p><p>the "public is prepared for bias" in the news </p><p>broadcasts of Radio Sawa and the proposed U.S. </p><p>satellite channel.  In the article, Dr. Nabil Al- </p><p>Sharif, Chief Editor of center-left, influential </p><p>Arabic daily Al-Dustour suggested that Arab </p><p>negativity to the U.S. is a reaction to U.S. policy, </p><p>not its packaging.  He said: "The U.S. must exercise </p><p>fair-handedness in the Middle East in order to prove </p><p>itself."  This sentiment has been echoed in opinion </p><p>columns in Jordan\'s Arabic papers.
