(C) ON AUGUST 28 THREE COMMERCIAL FARMERS REPRESENTING </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) PAID A CALL ON THE DCM AND </p><p>ECONOFF TO DESCRIBE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR COLLECTIVE </p><p>PLIGHT AND TO ADVISE US THAT IN THEIR VIEW TIME WAS RUNNING </p><p>OUT TO HALT MUGABE\'S ACTIONS THAT ARE DESTROYING ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC FOUNDATION.  THEY ALSO REQUESTED THE USG VIEW OF THE </p><p>SITUATION, AND ADVISED US THAT THEY WERE MAKING SIMILAR CALLS </p><p>AT OTHER PRINCIPAL MISSIONS INCLUDING THE UK, GERMANY, THE </p><p>EU, THE BELGIANS AND SOME OF THE NORDIC COUNTRIES.  THE </p><p>VISITORS WERE WILLIAM HUGHES, CFU VICE PRESIDENT FOR REGIONS; </p><p>MACK CRAWFORD, CFU REPRESENTATIVE FOR MATABELELAND; AND DAVE </p><p>DUBARE, A MATABELELAND FARMER AND CFU MEMBER.  THEY BELIEVE </p><p>FIRMLY THAT PRESIDENTS MBEKI, MOGAE AND CHISSANO HOLD THE KEY </p><p>TO CHANGING MUGABE\'S PATH, AS THEIR COUNTERPARTS DID YEARS </p><p>AGO WHEN THEIR CONCERTED ACTION FORCED IAN SMITH FROM POWER. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE CORE MESSAGE THEY DELIVERED WAS A SIMPLE ONE: </p><p>AFTER 18 MONTHS OF HARASSMENT AND EXTREME FINANCIAL AND </p><p>PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE, THE COUNTRY\'S COMMERCIAL FARMERS ARE </p><p>CLOSE TO THE POINT OF THROWING IN THE TOWEL, EITHER </p><p>COLLECTIVELY OR INDIVIDUALLY.  THE PRESSURE HAS RISEN </p><p>CONSIDERABLY IN RECENT WEEKS, AS EVENTS IN CHINHOYI, HWEDZA, </p><p>DHOMA AND MATABELELAND INDICATE.  THE FARMERS DESCRIBED A </p><p>NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TACTICS BEING USED IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS </p><p>BY THE GOZ TO DRIVE THEM OUT OF BUSINESS OR OFF THEIR FARMS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02554  01 OF 02  291833Z </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE WESTERN DISTRICTS AND IN THE AREA BETWEEN </p><p>HARARE AND MUTARE, WIDESPREAD BURNING OF WINTER CATTLE </p><p>GRAZING PASTURES HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT TO DESTROY THE </p><p>VIABILITY OF BEEF OPERATIONS (THE FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE </p><p>OUTBREAK HAS SHUT DOWN ALL CATTLE TRANSPORT - SO RELIEF BY </p><p>HERD RELOCATION IS RULED OUT).  AT THE SAME TIME FIRES HAVE </p><p>BEEN SET IN ADJOINING COMMUNAL AREAS TO DRIVE PEASANTS ONTO </p><p>THE RANCHERS\' PROPERTIES, WHERE THEY CONSIDER THE STOCK TO BE </p><p>THERE FOR THE TAKING.  ANOTHER TACTIC WAS MAKING SURE THAT AN </p><p>INVADER\'S SETTLEMENT IS ON EACH AND EVERY COMMERCIAL FARM, </p><p>AND THAT AT LEAST ONE AUTOMATIC WEAPON IS AT EACH SETTLEMENT </p><p>TO BE SHOWN TO FARM WORKERS TO REMIND THEM OF THEIR FATE </p><p>SHOULD THEY INTERFERE WITH THE INVADERS OR VOTE WRONGLY IN </p><p>ANY UPCOMING ELECTIONS.  THE FARMERS POINTED OUT THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ARRAY OF EVOLVING TACTICS WAS CLEARLY DESIGNED </p><p>AND EXECUTED TO SKATE BELOW THE RADAR SCREEN OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ATTENTION BROUGHT ON BY VIOLENCE, AND ALL AGREED THAT THE GOZ </p><p>HAD BEEN FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL OF LATE IN THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE FARMERS TOLD US THAT OUT OF FEAR, EXASPERATION </p><p>AND SIMPLE FATIGUE, A COMMUNITY OF FARMERS IN THE VIRGINIA </p><p>AREA (ABOUT 100 K EAST OF HARARE AND AN AREA THAT SAW MUCH </p><p>VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION AND A NUMBER OF MURDERS IN THE RUNUP </p><p>TO PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS LAST YEAR) HAD CUT AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>DEAL WITH THE INVADERS, GIVING UP 30 TO 40 PERCENT OF THEIR </p><p>LAND JUST TO BE LEFT ALONE AND IN PEACE.  THIS WAS THE FIRST </p><p>WE HAD HEARD OF SUCH A DEVELOPMENT, AND THE FARMERS </p><p>REPRESENTING THE UNION CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THAT SUCH ACTIONS </p><p>UNDERMINED NATIONAL COLLECTIVE EFFORTS AND PLAYED INTO THE </p><p>WISHES OF THE RULING PARTY.  AS ONE OF THEM QUIPPED ON THEIR </p><p>WAY OUT, "UNITED WE NEGOTIATE, DIVIDED WE BEG." </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02554  01 OF 02  291833Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE FARMERS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE RAPIDLY </p><p>DETERIORATING AND HYPERINFLATIONARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, </p><p>SPURRED BY THE RAPIDLY DECLINING ZIMDOLLAR, MAY ALSO PUT ANY </p><p>OF THOSE FARMERS WHO REMAIN OUT OF BUSINESS.  "WELL OVER HALF </p><p>OF OUR INPUTS ARE IMPORTED, AND WE JUST CANNOT PAY 700, 1000 </p><p>OR 1500 ZIMDOLLARS (THE LATTER A YEAR END RATE PREDICTION) TO </p><p>THE U.S. DOLLAR AND STAY IN BUSINESS."  THEY CLOSED WITH THE </p><p>POINT THAT THEY AND THEIR COLLEAGUES ARE BEING PUSHED TO THE </p><p>BRINK, AND WITH A PLEA THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHEN </p><p>THE POLITICAL ISSUES ARE FINALLY DECIDED, BE PREPARED TO AID </p><p>AGRICULTURE\'S RESUSCITATION VIA A SIZABLE HARD CURRENCY </p><p>FACILITY PRICED AT REASONABLE RATES TO GET THE INDUSTRY BACK </p><p>ON ITS FEET. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: WE DIFFER WITH NONE OF THE ANALYSIS OR </p><p>CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE FARMERS.  THEIR RECOGNITION OF THE </p><p>GUILE AND TACTICS ARRAYED AGAINST THEM IS NOT FLAWED, AND </p><p>THEIR COMMERCIALLY-BASED ECONOMIC SUGGESTIONS ARE REASONABLE </p><p>ONES.  WE SKETCHED OUT USG CONCERNS AND INTERESTS, AND SOME </p><p>OF THE POSSIBLE PATHS FORWARD.  OUR CONTACTS WITH THIS GROUP </p><p>WILL CONTINUE, AS BOTH SIDES FOUND IT WORTHWHILE, EVEN IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF A VERY BLEAK OUTLOOK. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ3805 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02554  02 OF 02  291834Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------187056  291834Z /45 </p><p>P 291436Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9587 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002554 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EPS </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER, C WILKINSON </p><p>USDOC FOR 4510 ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/28/06 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, ETRD, PHUM, PGOV, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02554  02 OF 02  291834Z </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S COMMERCIAL FARMERS BEING BACKED TO THE </p><p>WALL </p><p> </p><p>ROTH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
