<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000463 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PAB SA/RA (FOR SCENSNY) </p><p>SA/PD LJIRWIN, WREINCKENS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY:  IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. On 3/20 the ISLAND (opposition daily, islandwide </p><p>circulation) said "there is no doubt which way the war will </p><p>go," but predicted that it will not only "bring about </p><p>radical changes in the politics of ... the Middle East but </p><p>... will also turn the new political order ... topsy </p><p>turvy," as the "the democratic idealism that gradually came </p><p>to the forefront in US foreign policy [is] ... replaced </p><p>with sheer militarism and disregard for international law </p><p>and the UN."  The ISLAND concludes:  "the world can only </p><p>hope that what is happening is an aberration." </p><p> </p><p>2. Block quotes: </p><p> </p><p>It\'s all over but the shouting.  George Bush and Tony Blair </p><p>are marching to war but there are no delirious cries of </p><p>patriotic fervour from their countrymen, no ringing </p><p>assurances of support from their allies, no support from </p><p>nations that have had good relations with the two warring </p><p>nations and certainly very strong opposition being </p><p>expressed in the Islamic world. </p><p> </p><p>Paradoxically, Saddam Hussein whom the American President </p><p>wants to drive out of power is by no means a person liked </p><p>and loved by even a very few, save his own cohorts.  The </p><p>reign of terror during which he has held the Iraqi people </p><p>in bondage, the unwanted wars he had brought upon the </p><p>country - the over ten years of war with Iran and the </p><p>invasion of Kuwait - have left the country in shambles and </p><p>its people in untold misery.  They have been suffering </p><p>under UN imposed sanctions for over a decade.  But a war is </p><p>being opposed by the great majority of nations and </p><p>naturally by the Iraqis.  They most probably want Saddam </p><p>Hussein out but not a war.  This war could make Saddam </p><p>Hussein, truly a Satyr, into a Martyr. </p><p> </p><p>There is no doubt which way the war will go.  The Daily </p><p>Telegraph report from the Kuwait - Iraq border (see page 8) </p><p>said the stark choices for the Iraqi soldiers in the </p><p>battlefield are to: run, surrender or die fighting.  The </p><p>last chance for diplomacy is over.  The United States, </p><p>Britain and Spain on Monday announced that they were </p><p>withdrawing a draft resolution submitted to the UN Security </p><p>Council which authorised the automatic use of force and </p><p>which was likely to be rejected by the UN. Later, President </p><p>Bush in an address to the nation called upon President </p><p>Saddam Hussein to leave his country within 48 hours or face </p><p>war that will start `at a time of our choosing\' </p><p> </p><p>This war is not only bound to bring about radical changes </p><p>in the politics of Iraq and that of the Middle East but it </p><p>will also turn the new political order that was taking </p><p>shape after the Cold War, topsy turvy. </p><p> </p><p>For over a century, western European nations and the United </p><p>States have been working as allies and in close political </p><p>and economic collaboration having fought two World Wars and </p><p>been united for half a century in the Cold War against the </p><p>Soviet Union. </p><p> </p><p>Having triumphed in the Cold War, during the past decade </p><p>they have been working very closely as allies, attempting </p><p>to forge a new international order.  Whether, it was a </p><p>multi-polar world that was being forged or a uni-polar </p><p>world during the past decade, there was little doubt that </p><p>co-operation and understanding between the Atlantic </p><p>Alliance remained unshaken.  But with the advent of </p><p>President Bush, there appears to have been much bulldozing </p><p>in foreign policy and finally the issue of war on Iraq has </p><p>rendered them apart. </p><p> </p><p>America\'s European allies, France and Germany, particularly </p><p>France, have stood firmly against a war on Iraq without the </p><p>sanction of the UN Security Council. President Chirac in a </p><p>very strongly worded statement on Monday said that most of </p><p>the recent debates in the UN have shown that the Security </p><p>Council was not prepared to, under present circumstances, </p><p>to approve a precipitate march to war and that there was no </p><p>justification for unilateral decision to resort to war. </p><p>President Chirac in oblique ways said that the US was </p><p>ignoring international law and appealed to every one to </p><p>ensure the respect of international legality. </p><p> </p><p>This kind of unilateral action was not possible at the time </p><p>of the existence of the other superpower, the Soviet Union </p><p>but even after its demise both President Bush\'s father and </p><p>President Bill Clinton preferred multi-lateralism and </p><p>sought to work through the UN.  The Bush (Snr) in his war </p><p>with Saddam Hussein worked in accordance with UN Security </p><p>Council resolutions and was able to bring together a </p><p>coalition of nations including those of Arab hardline </p><p>nations such as Syria led by the late President Assad. </p><p>Today, if Bush (Jnr) goes to war he will have only two </p><p>other leaders - British and Spanish Prime Ministers - with </p><p>him and even then there is strong opposition to the war in </p><p>those countries, three cabinet ministers resigning from </p><p>Tony Blair\'s cabinet and a 139 Labour members voting for a </p><p>motion against the war. </p><p> </p><p>Now that the war seems inevitable the question to be posed </p><p>is:  After the War, what? </p><p> </p><p>What would concern the entire world is whether the </p><p>democratic idealism that gradually came to the forefront in </p><p>US foreign policy in the last few decades, despite </p><p>emergence of Cold war presidents like Reagan, will be </p><p>replaced with sheer militarism and disregard for </p><p>international law and the UN. The world can only hope that </p><p>what is happening is an aberration. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
