<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006939 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA AND PRM; PLEASE PASS TO USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, KPAL, KWBG, IS, JO, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: UNRWA AND FAA 301(C) COMPLIANCE:  VIEWS FROM GAZA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 235520 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This message has been cleared by Embassy Tel Aviv. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary:  In the course of November 18 meetings with </p><p>UNRWA\'s Gaza program chiefs, regional refcoord reviewed </p><p>UNRWA\'s compliance with section 301(c) of the Foreign </p><p>Assistance Act.  The Relief and Social Services Chief told </p><p>refcoord that UNRWA\'s social workers play a key role in </p><p>enforcing 301(C) compliance, by reporting problematic </p><p>behavior to UNRWA\'s eight camp services officers.  Through </p><p>this informal reporting system, UNRWA has been able to remove </p><p>known terrorists from its benefit rolls but in some cases </p><p>continues to provide services to the terrorists\' families. </p><p>UNRWA screens beneficiaries of its emergency food and jobs </p><p>programs only to ensure that refugees have not received </p><p>assistance from other organizations.  Temporary laborers </p><p>hired under the emergency programs are hired directly by </p><p>UNRWA\'s Administrative Department on 45-day contracts and </p><p>UNRWA does not conduct reference checks on these </p><p>beneficiaries.  However, UNRWA does conduct reference checks </p><p>on all long-term direct-hire employees employed with </p><p>emergency appeal funding.  UNRWA staff also clarified the </p><p>agency\'s relationship to youth activity centers (YAC).  Only </p><p>one YAC -- in Mwassi -- is co-located with an UNRWA program </p><p>office.  While UNRWA provides financial support only for </p><p>specific programming, other organizations -- including Hamas </p><p>-- also provide financial support to the YACs and hold </p><p>political activities on their premises.  Finally, UNRWA is </p><p>interviewing candidates for the US-funded OSO positions and </p><p>will have the team of 8 international and Palestinian staff </p><p>in place by early January.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Relief Services </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) As in the West Bank, UNRWA\'s Gaza field office </p><p>screens relief beneficiaries only to ensure that they meet </p><p>UNRWA\'s needs-based criteria, which includes the stipulation </p><p>that beneficiaries not have any means of support other than </p><p>UNRWA.  To monitor beneficiaries, UNRWA\'s 75 social workers </p><p>pay at least one home visit per year to the 17,000 special </p><p>hardship case families in Gaza.  According to Gaza Relief and </p><p>Social Services chief Aqil AbuShammalah, UNRWA social workers </p><p>"know everything" that happens in the camps and report any </p><p>problematic behavior to UNRWA\'s eight camp services officers, </p><p>ensuring that refugees who engage in suspect behavior do not </p><p>receive UNRWA benefits.  AbuShammalah cautioned, however, </p><p>that this informal reporting system is dependent on </p><p>confidentiality and assurances that information will remain </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>only within the UNRWA system.  Noting that several </p><p>Palestinians have been murdered on suspicions that they </p><p>collaborated with Israeli authorities, AbuShammalah said </p><p>UNRWA social workers would not be willing to continue sharing </p><p>information about activities within the camps if they felt it </p><p>would be passed outside UNRWA.  He asserted that specific </p><p>training on FAA 301(C) issues, as proposed in PRM\'s November </p><p>1 letter to UNRWA ComGen Peter Hansen (ref), would create </p><p>precisely the wrong impression and turn off an otherwise </p><p>useful source of information. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AbuShammalah also told refcoord that UNRWA has </p><p>removed known criminals from its relief rolls, citing the </p><p>case of a would-be bombmaker who was injured in a Jabaliya </p><p>camp "work accident."  Although the now disabled would-be </p><p>bombmaker normally would qualify for UNRWA assistance, the </p><p>circumstances of his injury caused UNRWA to remove him from </p><p>its relief rolls.  Yet UNRWA continues to provide relief </p><p>services to the bombmaker\'s wife and children.  Similarly, </p><p>AbuShammalah said, UNRWA recently built a new home for the </p><p>family of a terrorist killed by the Israelis, whose Khan </p><p>Younis home was demolished by the IDF.  "Can UNRWA engage in </p><p>a policy of collective punishment?"  AbuShammalah asked </p><p>refcoord. </p><p> </p><p>Temporary Employment Programs </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In Gaza, UNRWA\'s emergency appeal-funded temporary </p><p>employment programs are run directly by UNRWA\'s </p><p>Administrative Department.  The Administrative Department and </p><p>Relief and Social Services Department screen applicants to </p><p>ensure that they meet UNRWA\'s needs-based criteria (again, </p><p>including to determine whether applicants receive relief from </p><p>any other organizations), and rank-order applicants in </p><p>accordance with family size.  Priority is given to refugees </p><p>with more than 12 dependents.  Refugees are then hired on </p><p>45-day contracts to perform manual labor on the many </p><p>infrastructure projects underway with emergency funds. </p><p>Relief and Social Services Chief AbuShammalah told refcoord </p><p>UNRWA does not conduct reference checks on applicants for the </p><p>45-day labor contracts.  Noting that UNRWA\'s Gaza field has </p><p>approved 95,000 temporary employment applications since the </p><p>emergency jobs program started in January 2001.  AbuShammalah </p><p>and Gaza Deputy Director Christer Nordahl said UNRWA does not </p><p>have the staff resources required to conduct reference checks </p><p>on this extremely large beneficiary pool. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) A significant number of temporary employees also has </p><p>been hired directly by UNRWA on contracts ranging from three </p><p>to 12 months, to work on direct UNRWA programming.  In the </p><p>health sector, for example, UNRWA has increased its clinic </p><p>staff by 20 percent to meet a 20 percent increase in the </p><p>demand for services.  In the environmental health department, </p><p>UNRWA has hired 1,300 new sanitation workers.  In the </p><p>education department, UNRWA has hired 104 full-time </p><p>counselors to help students cope with the psychological </p><p>effects of violence.  It also has hired 35 new school </p><p>janitors with emergency appeal funding.  The department </p><p>chiefs assured refcoord that UNRWA conducts reference checks </p><p>on all long-term direct-hired employees hired with emergency </p><p>appeal funding. </p><p> </p><p>Emergency Food Assistance </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Under UNRWA\'s emergency programs, the agency </p><p>currently is providing food assistance to 125,000 of the </p><p>193,000 registered refugee families in Gaza.  Relief and </p><p>Social Services Chief AbuShammalah told refcoord UNRWA </p><p>screens emergency food aid beneficiaries only to ensure that </p><p>they are not employed by UNRWA or the PA.  UNRWA Gaza Deputy </p><p>Director Nordahl told refcoord UNRWA does not have the </p><p>personnel or financial resources to conduct any further </p><p>screening of food assistance beneficiaries. </p><p> </p><p>Emergency Health Programming Limited to Refugees </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Unlike in the West Bank, UNRWA\'s Gaza health </p><p>department is not serving a significant number of </p><p>non-refugees.  Due to the small geographic size of Gaza and </p><p>close proximity of PA health centers, non-refugees have been </p><p>continuously able to access PA and private health services. </p><p>(In the West Bank, however, severe closures have forced </p><p>non-refugees to turn to nearby UNRWA health clinics for care, </p><p>and vice versa.)  According to Health Director Dr. Ayub Alam, </p><p>UNRWA\'s health services to the non-refugee population in Gaza </p><p>have been limited to temporary loans of supplies and </p><p>medicines to PA clinics during periods of total closure in </p><p>Gaza.  Gaza Deputy Director Nordahl told refcoord all loans </p><p>to PA clinics have been repaid. </p><p> </p><p>Youth Activity Centers </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Relief and Social Services Chief AbuShammalah </p><p>explained that only one youth activity center -- in Mwassi -- </p><p>is located in an UNRWA-owned building.  Although the Mwassi </p><p>YAC shares space with UNRWA\'s relief and social services </p><p>office, no UN flag flies over the premises.  UNRWA\'s real </p><p>relationship with YACs in Gaza exists in the small cash </p><p>subsidies -- USD 3,000 to 4,000 per year -- provided for </p><p>specific programming such as sporting events or after-school </p><p>activities.  AbuShammalah explained that other organizations, </p><p>including Hamas and various Palestinian political factions, </p><p>also provide cash subsidies to the YACs and hold political </p><p>events in their premises.  The YACs also support their </p><p>programming by renting their premises for weddings and </p><p>nonpolitical community events.  Although UNRWA insists that </p><p>the YACs enforce a strict no-weapons policy at all events as </p><p>a condition for its continued financial support, AbuShammalah </p><p>admitted that the agency has no control over the content of </p><p>programming at the YACs. </p><p> </p><p>US-Funded OSO Program </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) With USD 1.46 million in US special project funding, </p><p>UNRWA is in the process of hiring eight new international </p><p>staff to serve as Operations Support Officers (OSOs).  Among </p><p>other responsibilities, the OSOs will monitor UNRWA </p><p>installations and programs to ensure they are not misused. </p><p>In the West Bank, where the agency had already begun </p><p>recruitment for five non US-funded OSO positions in mid-2002, </p><p>UNRWA quickly identified qualified staff from an existing </p><p>pool of applicants and will have the new OSO team in place by </p><p>the end of November.  In Gaza, UNRWA only began reviewing </p><p>applicants after the West Bank had selected its OSOs.  Deputy </p><p>Gaza Director Christer Nordahl told refcoord that UNRWA will </p><p>interview OSOs during the week of November 24 and will have </p><p>the complete OSO team in place by early January. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
