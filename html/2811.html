<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000972 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/W, AF/RA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR JENDAYI </p><p>FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ELECTION AFTERMATH; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Wade has joined the bootlicking </p><p>   brigade," the government-controlled daily </p><p>   "Chronicle" dedicated its May 22 editorial to </p><p>   denouncing Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade for </p><p>   "discrediting" the outcome Zimbabwe\'s presidential </p><p>   election.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Senegalese President Mr. Abdoulaye Wade recently </p><p>   let the cat out of the bag when he joined the chorus </p><p>   led by Britain and its Western allies in discrediting </p><p>   Zimbabwe\'s presidential elections.  He became the only </p><p>   African head of state to make an adverse statement </p><p>   about the polls that everybody else in their right </p><p>   minds has declared free and fair.  His outburst leaves </p><p>   us wondering what the basis of his opinion is, since </p><p>   his country did not participate in the polls. . .  An </p><p>   old adage says money is the root of all evil.  We know </p><p>   that Mr. Wade has decided to join the bootlicking </p><p>   brigade of countries in the West for a few pieces of </p><p>   silver.  What he appears to be oblivious of is the fact </p><p>   that by becoming the bad apple in the African basket, </p><p>   he has pressed a button of self-destruction.  We would </p><p>   like to advise Mr. Made to lick the boots of his </p><p>   Western masters without dragging the name of Zimbabwe </p><p>   in mud. </p><p> </p><p>   "The Senegalese leader should be warned that </p><p>   history has shown that Western countries are good </p><p>   at using African leaders and dumping them as and </p><p>   when it suits them. . .  We are also aware that </p><p>   these remarks were made against the background of a </p><p>   meeting to promote the New Economic Partnership for </p><p>   Africa\'s Development (NEPAD).  Maybe Mr. Made was </p><p>   just trying to be a good boy.  We would like to </p><p>   urge African states to avoid being divided by </p><p>   Western countries for the sake of donor funds.  We </p><p>   do not have to sell each other\'s souls in order to </p><p>   get funding for NEPAD." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
