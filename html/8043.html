<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001367 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR L/UNA AND EB/ESC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, CA, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA: STATUS OF LOCAL LAWS IMPLEMENTING IRAQ </p><p>SANCTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 123640 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) We raised the questions contained in reftel with </p><p>Christopher Hull, Iraq political and trade relations officer </p><p>in DFAIT\'s Middle East Division, on May 13. Hull indicated </p><p>that Canada had regulations in place (known as the UN/Iraq </p><p>regulations) to implement its obligations under UNSCR 661 and </p><p>other Iraq UNSC resolutions. Hull said there are two options </p><p>for undoing the regulations once the UNSC lifts the Iraq </p><p>sanctions: the current regulations can either be modified, or </p><p>the current regulations can be repealed altogether. He </p><p>indicated that adoption of the sanctions-lift resolution </p><p>would not be sufficient in itself to permit import and trade </p><p>in Iraqi products; some action will have to be taken </p><p>regarding Canada\'s UN/Iraq regulations. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) As to the time required, Hull said that the repeal of </p><p>the regulations could be accomplished fairly quickly. </p><p>However, if the regulations are either modified or replaced </p><p>with new regulations, this would take longer.  He noted that </p><p>the process of repealing them would be initiated by DFAIT, go </p><p>to the Privy Council for review, and then to the Governor </p><p>General for formal approval.  Hull felt it would be difficult </p><p>to begin the process before UNSC adoption of the </p><p>sanctions-lift resolution, although he promised to  confer </p><p>with DFAIT\'s legal division on this point. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
