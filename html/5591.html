<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000167 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, BG, IN, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: WIN AUNG IN INDIA AND OTHER RECENT GOB TOURS OF </p><p>THE NEIGHBORHOOD </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) RANGOON 116 </p><p>     B. (B) BEIJING 1078 </p><p>     C. (C) 02 DHAKA 3704 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The SPDC\'s recent trips to India, China, and </p><p>Bangladesh, together with its exchanges with Thailand, are </p><p>intended to shore up regional support for Burma in </p><p>anticipation of a possible deterioration in Burma\'s relations </p><p>with the West. According to the Director of MFA\'s Southwest </p><p>and Southwest Asia Division, recent visits to India and </p><p>Bangladesh, in particular, focused on infrastructure links, </p><p>and trade and investment.  Reportedly, Burmese Foreign </p><p>Minister Win Aung came back from India with a $25 million </p><p>soft loan, among other promises. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>India </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) U Ye Myint, the Director of South and Southwest Asia </p><p>Affairs in Burma\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told poloff </p><p>on February 4 that Foreign Minister Win Aung\'s January 19 - </p><p>23 trip to India was not intended to reassure India regarding </p><p>Burma\'s ties with China.  While Win Aung\'s trip immediately </p><p>followed SPDC Chairman Than Shwe\'s trip to China, it was part </p><p>of an effort to shore up Burma\'s regional relations in </p><p>anticipation of a deterioration in relations with the West. </p><p>Right now, no regional states support Western sanctions on </p><p>Burma and the SPDC, with its flurry of recent visits, wanted </p><p>to make sure that there was no change in the position of </p><p>front-line states.  Than Shwe visited Bangladesh and China, </p><p>Win Aung visited India, and Thailand\'s Prime Minister was </p><p>shortly expected in Rangoon.  In each case, the focus of the </p><p>visit had been, or would be, economic cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In India, Win Aung visited New Delhi, Banglaore and </p><p>Calcutta.  In New Delhi, he met with the Vice President, </p><p>Prime Minister Atal Bihari Bajpayee, Finance Minister (and </p><p>former Foreign Minister) Jaswant Singh, and the new Foreign </p><p>Minister Yaswant Sinha; in Bangalore, he met Hyderabad\'s </p><p>Chief Minister and, in Calcutta, had meetings with the Indian </p><p>and Burmese business communities.  Reportedly, the </p><p>discussions produced a $25 million "soft" loan from India and </p><p>an invitation to India\'s Vice President to reciprocate </p><p>General Maung Aye\'s year 2000 visit to India.  They also </p><p>reviewed progress on a number of infrastructure projects, </p><p>including the trans-Burma highway, which is to run from Tamu </p><p>on the Indian border to Myawaddy on the Thai border; the </p><p>Kaladan Road and River network which is to lead down from </p><p>Mizoram to Sittwe; and the proposed Tamanthi Hydropower plant </p><p>on the Chindwin River.  According to U Ye Myint, all three </p><p>projects are still in the study stage.  A technical team from </p><p>India is due later this month to decide on the "alignment" </p><p>(i.e., route) for the trans-Burma highway; a second team is </p><p>completing studies on the Kaladan River and on enlargement of </p><p>the port at Sittwe (to allow it to take vessels of up to </p><p>6,000 tons); while a third is gathering data for the proposed </p><p>1,000 megawatt plant at Tamanthi.  Hyderabad\'s Chief Minister </p><p>also promised cooperation on IT development, while a private </p><p>Indian business group (not further identified) floated the </p><p>idea of a joint venture investment in a zinc and tin mine in </p><p>Burma. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Win Aung also reviewed the bidding on other issues, </p><p>including border control, India\'s interest in ASEAN, and the </p><p>development of BIMSTEC.  In regard to border control, Win </p><p>Aung reiterated Burma\'s interest in cooperation with India in </p><p>controlling insurgents, but ruled out joint patrols. </p><p>According to U Ye Myint, this refusal of joint patrols was a </p><p>long held position which was intended to avoid any </p><p>concessions on sovereignty that other neighbors might </p><p>exploit.  Over time, he said, India had come to understand </p><p>and accept that position.  On ASEAN, U Ye Myint said, Burma </p><p>promised to support India\'s interest in closer cooperation </p><p>and closer ties.  It also reiterated its intent to play an </p><p>"active role" in BIMSTEC </p><p> </p><p>Bangladesh </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Than Shwe\'s December visit to Bangladesh went equally </p><p>well.  According to U Ye Myint, Bangladesh recently adopted </p><p>its own "Look Eastward" policy.  Just as India re-assessed it </p><p>relations with Burma when it saw Chinese/Burmese cooperation </p><p>on the rise, so Bangladesh has done the same as it has </p><p>watched Burmese/Indian relations improve.  During the recent </p><p>visit, he said, the BDG said almost nothing about the </p><p>problems of the Rohingya Muslims and refugee repatriation. </p><p>The focus was almost entirely on trade, investment, and </p><p>infrastructure links.  The BDG was interested in a road link </p><p>from Dhaka through Burma and eventually onward to Thailand, </p><p>shipping links between Chittagong, Rangoon and other coastal </p><p>ports, improved border trade arrangments, and a new trade </p><p>settlement arrangement that would facilitate bilateral trade. </p><p> The GOB had no intrinsic objections to any of the proposals, </p><p>U Ye Myint said, but had not yet responded formally to any. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) U Ye Myint\'s explanation of the SPDC\'s recent travels </p><p>rings true.  The GOB appreciates the support it has received </p><p>from neighboring states in bringing to a close many of its </p><p>long running insurgencies, and in dealing with other common </p><p>problems, like narcotics.  It also values the cushion that </p><p>regional states have provided against the impact of Western </p><p>sanctions.  We also note a report in the anti-regime </p><p>Democratic Voice of Burma of January 28 attributed to the </p><p>SPDC\'s Lt. Gen. Soe Win, in which the general "guaranteed </p><p>that there would be no military intervention against Burma by </p><p>the American government...as Burma is friendly with China, </p><p>this kind of scenario could be protected against."  If the </p><p>DVB quote is accurate, it suggests that the GOB now believes </p><p>that it can rely on regional support not only in dealing with </p><p>common problems (like refugees, narcotics, and regional </p><p>development), but also the West.  Some foreign observers </p><p>still characterize Burma\'s military regime as xenophobic, but </p><p>the SPDC found out long ago that its interests are better </p><p>served by engagement, at least with near neighbors, than by </p><p>any effort to keep the world at a distance.  That, in fact, </p><p>was one of the major changes that took place when the current </p><p>crew of generals replaced Ne Win back in 1988.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
