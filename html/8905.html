<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000880 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, EFIN, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: AKP AND THE ISTANBUL "ESNAFLAR": A PERFECT MATCH? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Support from the Istanbul "esnaflar" ) </p><p>small businessmen, restaurant owners, craftsmen, shopkeepers, </p><p>street vendors, and taxi and truck drivers - may have </p><p>contributed to the Justice and Development (AK) Party\'s </p><p>November 2002 electoral success, but this support may be less </p><p>solid than it appears.  Esnaflar are frustrated with their </p><p>economic circumstances and expect Prime Minister Erdogan to </p><p>deliver economic salvation... or at least populist hand-outs. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Esnaflar": Part of AKP\'s Base? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) Although Turkish "esnaflar" ) small businessmen, </p><p>restaurant owners, craftsmen, shopkeepers, street vendors, </p><p>and taxi and truck drivers ) may not have the same influence </p><p>and access that wealthier manufacturing and industrial groups </p><p>enjoy, together they make up one of the largest sectors of </p><p>the voting population.  The Turkish Esnaflar and Artisan </p><p>Union, an umbrella organization for 172 different esnaflar </p><p>chambers, claims to represent 3 million Istanbul residents </p><p>(700,000 registered members and their families), about a </p><p>quarter of the population.  Narrow profit margins, a greedy </p><p>and corrupt bureaucracy, and a lack of access to credit and </p><p>loans have left most of Istanbul\'s esnaflar on the edge of </p><p>poverty.  The two-year old economic crisis hit this group </p><p>especially hard, forcing many into bankruptcy and the ranks </p><p>of the unemployed and others onto the streets to protest </p><p>government demands that they pay outstanding social security </p><p>debt and personal loans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) This combination of voting power and desperation has </p><p>made this group a major target for political parties in </p><p>Turkey.  Although it is difficult to make generalizations, </p><p>anecdotal evidence and common wisdom suggest that, in line </p><p>with the majority of the Turkish population, esnaflar tend to </p><p>be both politically conservative and religiously devout, </p><p>voting mostly for right-wing parties.  The Board of the </p><p>Istanbul Esnaflar and Artisan Union (IESB), for example, </p><p>includes an adviser to the Chairman of the True Path Party, a </p><p>senior Istanbul Motherland Party official, and two Justice </p><p>and Development (AK) Party members.  Suat Yalkin, IESB </p><p>President for the last 18 years, told poloff that IESB is </p><p>careful not to endorse particular parties, but he conceded </p><p>that IESB members provided significant support to the AK </p><p>Party in last November\'s elections, despite the fact that </p><p>IESB had specifically distanced itself from the now-banned </p><p>Welfare and Virtue Parties for their Islamic leanings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Frustration or Fanaticisim? </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Our anecdotal contacts with typical esnaflar </p><p>restaurant owners and shopkeepers confirm that AK made </p><p>inroads into these groups.  One restaurateur admitted to </p><p>voting for AK, citing frustration with the difficult economic </p><p>situation and the ineffective and corrupt politicians in </p><p>Ankara as his motivating factor.  A shopkeeper said he voted </p><p>for AK because of his confidence in former Istanbul Mayor and </p><p>AK Chairman Tayyip Erdogan.  We have heard similar accounts </p><p>from vegetable sellers, tailors, and small shop owners.  On </p><p>the other hand, for every AK supporter we have met, other </p><p>esnaflar told us that they have given up on politicians </p><p>altogether and did not vote at all in the last elections.  On </p><p>the whole, our sense is that AK support among the esnaflar </p><p>rests on Erdogan\'s charisma, AK\'s "clean" reputation, and </p><p>growing frustration with the inability of "corrupt" Ankara </p><p>politicians to address the crippling economic situation. </p><p>Rarely have we encountered esnaflar that supported AK for </p><p>purely ideological reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Can AKP and Erdogan Deliver? </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>5. (SBU) IESB President Yalkin claimed that despite this </p><p>support, AK has not been particularly responsive to esnaflar </p><p>concerns.  According to Yalkin, esnaflar have almost no ready </p><p>access to credit and bank loans.  (Note: This is a frequent </p><p>complaint we hear from esnaflar, who claim that because such </p><p>credits are unavailable, they must save up their own money or </p><p>borrow from friends and family.)  Yalkin complained that the </p><p>ratio between loans to small and large businesses in Turkey </p><p>is less than 1:100, while in most western economies the </p><p>figure is closer to 50:50.  This notwithstanding, Yalkin </p><p>complained that the AK government has so far refused to take </p><p>measures to prevent the privatization of state-owned Halk </p><p>Bank, the only institution that has been willing to lend to </p><p>esnaflar in the past.  Esnaflar, like the Turkish farmers, </p><p>have also pushed the government to forgive their </p><p>non-performing bank loans (USD 20 to 40 million). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Yalkin allowed, however, that Erdogan seemed to be </p><p>making a personal effort.  Following an appeal from esnaflar </p><p>representatives, Erdogan tripled the amount of a small credit </p><p>fund for esnaflar in the 2003 budget (increasing it to </p><p>approximately USD 80 million).  Erdogan also eliminated a </p><p>requirement that potential applicants pay all of their </p><p>arrears to the state pension fund (a condition almost none of </p><p>them can satisfy).  Yalkin claims that the 44 percent </p><p>interest rate for the fund has limited its utility (only </p><p>one-third of the money has been disbursed), but he believes </p><p>that Erdogan may lower the rate by another ten percent when </p><p>he addresses a gathering of esnaflar in Ankara on June 24. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7. (SBU) Many have pointed to esnaflar support as one of the </p><p>factors that underpinned AKP\'s electoral success in Istanbul. </p><p> Absent any comprehensive studies it is difficult to draw </p><p>definitive conclusions, but it is probably safe to say that </p><p>they supported AKP in numbers equal to or greater than the </p><p>general population.  Anecdotal conversations with individual </p><p>shopkeepers and other esnaflar, however, suggest that this </p><p>support may be skin-deep and highly dependent on AKP\'s </p><p>ability to turn the economy around or at least deliver </p><p>populist hand-outs, including subsidized credits and loan </p><p>forgiveness.  A similar perception within AK doubtless </p><p>explains the government\'s intermittent populist gestures, </p><p>which have periodically roiled Turkish markets and put in </p><p>doubt its commitment to economic reform. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
