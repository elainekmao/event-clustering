<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001266 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR (BOGUE) </p><p>DEFENSE FOR OSD/DASD-EURASIA (RICARDEL) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PARM, PREL, MOPS, HR, IQ </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA CONSIDERING OFFERING TROOPS TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Poloff A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Croatia is actively considering contributing forces </p><p>to support Phase IV operations in Iraq.  The idea of </p><p>contributing a small number of military police to deploy as </p><p>part of a multi-national unit has been broached with the </p><p>Embassy informally several times, including with the </p><p>Ambassador by Foreign Minister Picula, but a formal offer has </p><p>not yet been made.  GoC officials seek a wide range of </p><p>details in order to budget and plan for a possible deployment </p><p>so they can brief the Cabinet and Parliament on the political </p><p>and financial costs of a commitment of forces.  On June 4, we </p><p>informed the GoC that, before the USG will engage in initial </p><p>military-to-military discussions, PM Racan\'s cabinet must </p><p>make a formal political commitment of its intent to join the </p><p>coalition.  Before we can enter a more detailed discussion of </p><p>operational plans, Croatia\'s parliament must approve the </p><p>deployment of forces to Iraq, whereby Croatia would join the </p><p>Coalition.  GoC officials expressed some frustration at </p><p>having to make a commitment to deploy forces without details </p><p>about cost and without assurances that Croatia\'s offer would </p><p>be accepted, but were confident they could secure a Cabinet </p><p>commitment solid enough to begin initial discussions.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In the run-up to military operations to liberate </p><p>Iraq, Croatia\'s political leaders were sharply and publicly </p><p>negative in their response to U.S. requests to join the </p><p>coalition.  While this approach may have won mild praise from </p><p>some EU members at the time, senior GoC officials hope that </p><p>offering to deploy troops to Iraq will help repair the damage </p><p>they caused to the U.S.-Croatia bilateral relationship.  The </p><p>GoC is exploring the possibility of deploying a small number </p><p>of military police to Iraq as part of a multinational unit. </p><p>While there has been no formal GoC decision to deploy, the </p><p>idea of a Croatian contribution has been floated publicly and </p><p>privately at all levels, including in the press on May 30 by </p><p>PM Racan and by FM Picula on May 29 with the Ambassador. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Croatian Defense Ministry policymakers and planners </p><p>have engaged with us to try to determine what the modalities </p><p>and costs of Croatia\'s so-far hypothetical deployment would </p><p>be.  But until the GoC has made a more formal commitment to </p><p>deploy forces to Iraq and thereby join the coalition, Croatia </p><p>will not have access to detailed operational plans.  After </p><p>consultations between DATT and experts at CENTCOM and </p><p>USEUCOM, we prepared for the GoC a sequence of events which </p><p>Croatia must follow as it prepares to deploy troops to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) On June 4, Defense Attache and Poloff met first with </p><p>Assistant Minister of Defense (Policy) Jelena Grcic Polic and </p><p>then with MFA North America Department Head Miroslav Kovacic </p><p>to explain how Croatia should proceed as it prepares to offer </p><p>a contingent of troops to deploy in Iraq.  We made clear that </p><p>until there has been a formal political commitment by the </p><p>GoC, the USG will not fully engage with military planners. </p><p>Assistant DefMin Grcic Polic said that this put her planners </p><p>in a tough spot; until they had precise information, they </p><p>would not have the projected cost details needed to draft the </p><p>decision for the Cabinet to approve.  We explained that the </p><p>initial policy decision by the Cabinet need not be a detailed </p><p>document intended for approval by the parliament, but rather </p><p>a formal declaration by Croatia\'s political leaders that </p><p>Croatia seeks to deploy troops to Iraq to support Coalition </p><p>efforts.  Grcic Polic was relieved, and speculated that a </p><p>Cabinet "Determination" (rather than a formal "Decision") </p><p>should be relatively easy to push through the Croatian </p><p>bureaucracy. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) We explained that once the GoC makes the initial </p><p>political decision to deploy, the U.S. could authorize </p><p>military-to-military technical discussions, including a </p><p>meeting at CENTCOM Headquarters with Croatian planners. </p><p>These initial discussions should produce enough information </p><p>about whether Croatia\'s offering meets the needs of the </p><p>coalition and about the details and projected costs of a </p><p>deployment for the GoC to take a more formal "Decision" to </p><p>deploy and then forward that decision to Parliament for </p><p> </p><p>approval (required by Croatian law before troops can deploy </p><p>abroad).  Once the Croatian Parliament approve the decision, </p><p>Croatia would be considered a member of the Coalition and </p><p>would therefore receive access to operational plans.  Then, </p><p>detailed discussions about modalities and timing of </p><p>deployment would begin, followed by, eventually, deployment </p><p>of Croatia\'s troops to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) At the MFA, Kovacic asked whether, before the GoC </p><p>exposes itself to the political risk of making an offer of </p><p>troops for Iraq, we could give assurances that Croatia\'s </p><p>offer of military police would be accepted.  We replied that </p><p>we could make no such assurances, but expressed our hope that </p><p>we could soon count Croatia as a member of the coalition. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The GoC leadership seems genuinely eager to make this </p><p>deployment a reality, but we will insist on a firm political </p><p>commitment before engaging in serious discussions.  Such a </p><p>political commitment to deploy should not be difficult to get </p><p>through the Cabinet, and a formal decision should, if </p><p>properly managed, pass the parliament.  Once this political </p><p>commitment is made, however, we are not certain that the unit </p><p>Croatia will propose will offers will measure up in military </p><p>terms.  We do not underestimate how difficult a task it is </p><p>for the GoC to deploy troops overseas; this is only the </p><p>second time they have done it (the first time was to ISAF in </p><p>January 2003), and the first time was a bureaucratic </p><p>disaster.  The financial burden of even the small deployment </p><p>of MP\'s to ISAF was difficult for the MoD budget to swallow. </p><p>Given the decline in the bilateral relationship due to a </p><p>number of GoC actions, the decision to deploy a small unit to </p><p>Iraq should not be taken as more than it is: an effort at </p><p>self-serving damage control. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
