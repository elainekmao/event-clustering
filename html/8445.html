<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003233 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR,  JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON SHARM EL-SHEIKH AND AQABA </p><p>SUMMITS </p><p> </p><p>                     News reports </p><p> </p><p>-- All dailies on June 3 led with reports on the Sharm </p><p>summit where King Abdullah is expected to arrive today </p><p>to deliver an address at the opening session. The </p><p>summit, according to the dailies, will focus on four </p><p>issues: the Roadmap, the situation in Iraq, the war on </p><p>terror, and President Bush\'s proposal to establish a </p><p>free trade market between 12 Arab countries and the </p><p>United States. Reports also included the meeting </p><p>between Foreign Minister Muasher and Secretary Powell, </p><p>who briefed the FM on the draft speech that President </p><p>Bush will deliver at the summit. Other reports said </p><p>that Arab foreign ministers at Sharm have agreed on </p><p>the draft final statement. </p><p>-- King meets Abu Mazen. All dailies reported that </p><p>King Abdullah met yesterday with Palestinian Prime </p><p>Minister Abu Mazen. Following the meeting, the King </p><p>said that the Aqaba summit is a serious step towards </p><p>implementing the Roadmap, which he described as a </p><p>historic opportunity to achieve peace. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>Editorial commentaries, political cartoons, and </p><p>analyses outside the opinion pages also dealt with the </p><p>Sharm and Aqaba summits. The overall outlook, as </p><p>expressed by analysts and commentators, is that the </p><p>Israeli government opposes the Roadmap in principle, </p><p>and that despite its acceptance it will do everything </p><p>possible to sabotage the map. All analysts agree that </p><p>the decisive factor in the success or failure of the </p><p>Roadmap will be the United States\' ability to pressure </p><p>Israel into honoring its commitments in the road map, </p><p>the likelihood of which they view with varying degrees </p><p>of pessimism. Below are sample commentaries. </p><p> </p><p>-- "Will the Aqaba Summit Succeed in Describing Sharon </p><p>As An Occupier?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Sultan Hattab writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of semi-official influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(06/03): "Those who meet at Sharm and in Aqaba should </p><p>wrench two issues from Sharon: The first is that the </p><p>territories on which his forces have been stood since </p><p>1967 are occupied territories. The second is that his </p><p>government should commit itself to a vision of two </p><p>neighboring states on the historical land of </p><p>Palestine, namely, Israel and Palestine. This should </p><p>be done before Sharon wrenches from the meeting, </p><p>particularly from the Palestinians, the recognition </p><p>that the State of Israel is a solely Jewish state, </p><p>which means writing off the Palestinians right of </p><p>return." </p><p> </p><p>-- "An Attempt to Render the Aqaba Summit A Failure" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Mahmoud Rimawi wrote in semi-official </p><p>influential Arabic daily Al-Rai (06/03): "The way the </p><p>occupation government [of Israel] has dealt with the </p><p>Roadmap, after the Palestinians and Arabs have </p><p>accepted it, surely indicates a premeditated attempt </p><p>to sabotage the Aqaba meeting. The danger is that the </p><p>Aqaba summit would be reduced to a forum for Israel\'s </p><p>fables and legends, which would drown the Roadmap, in </p><p>ambiguous and loose expressions about a Palestinian </p><p>state, instead of making a clear commitment to the </p><p>implementation of the articles of this plan, and to a </p><p>timetable and mechanisms to monitor, and follow up on </p><p>its implementation." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Summit in Sharm El-Sheikh and the Results in </p><p>Aqaba" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan wrote in independent, mass- </p><p>appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm (06/03): "If the </p><p>Sharm El-Sheikh summit is intended for the U.S. to </p><p>dictate its terms [to Arabs] as some Arab papers have </p><p>predicted, then the results will be revealed in the </p><p>statements at Aqaba, particularly that of Sharon. On </p><p>the other hand, if the Sharm summit aims to establish </p><p>an understanding between Bush and the other leaders, </p><p>this will be revealed in Bush\'s statement, also at </p><p>Aqaba. This is because tomorrow\'s summit, not today\'s </p><p>summit, will show the extent of the U.S. commitment to </p><p>the peace process and whether seriousness [in pursuing </p><p>peace] has replaced its indifference and blind bias </p><p>for Israel, which were the hallmarks of U.S. policy </p><p>under the current administration." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Full Jordanian Support for the Brothers in </p><p>Palestine" </p><p>After referring to the King\'s meeting with Palestinian </p><p>Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas "Abu Mazen" in Amman </p><p>yesterday, Center-left, influential Arabic daily    Al- </p><p>Dustour (06/03) editorialized: "The Aqaba summit </p><p>constitutes regional and international recognition of </p><p>Jordan\'s efforts, that had a great affect in </p><p>reinforcing the Palestinian\'s steadfastness in the </p><p>face of Israeli aggression and settlement program, and </p><p>in breaking the wall of international silence that has </p><p>enveloped the Palestinian scene. [Therefore] we look </p><p>forward to the Aqaba summit with optimism and hope, as </p><p>do many capitals in the region and beyond, as this big </p><p>event is seen as a historic opportunity to stop the </p><p>slide into the abyss of violence, extremism, and </p><p>chaos."
