Civilians will not be hurt.\'  Al papers report </p><p>that 150,000 U.S. and UK troops have entered the </p><p>demilitarized zone on the Kuwaiti border before the </p><p>ultimatum to Saddam expired, papers say.  President Bush has </p><p>decided to launch the operation earlier after receiving from </p><p>the Pentagon information that whereabouts of Saddam and his </p><p>top aides had been located.  President Bush is concerned </p><p>that the operation `might be tougher than estimated, and </p><p>take longer,\' reports say.  A limited number of cruise </p><p>missiles were used to target the Iraqi leadership.  The </p><p>Americans were careful to inflict minimum damage on Baghdad, </p><p>papers quote international broadcasters\' reporting. </p><p>"Milliyet" reports that commanders of the U.S. troops </p><p>deployed in Kuwait were keeping up the spirits of their </p><p>soldiers by encouraging them to put up `a proud fight.\' </p><p>`Iraqis are a decent nation, respect them.  Don\'t question </p><p>why you are here.  You\'ll be welcomed as `good boys\' when </p><p>you reach the North.  Do your job and go back home.  God is </p><p>with you,\' American commanders reportedly said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mainstream papers criticize the AKP government\'s </p><p>indecisiveness regarding the Iraq crisis which, they </p><p>believe, has incurred significant political, economic and </p><p>military risk for the country.  Turkey has failed to </p><p>guarantee a chair for the Turkomen in the post-war Iraq </p><p>administration, has been deprived of the right to a military </p><p>presence in Northern Iraq, and has missed the chance of $26 </p><p>billion of U.S. aid, they stress.  Concerned about the </p><p>looming war, Ankara was readying to give the nod to the U.S. </p><p>However, President Bush rejected further Turkish demands and </p><p>rejected Turkey\'s opening its soil for U.S. troops by saying </p><p>it was `too late,\' papers emphasize.  Erdogan has suffered a </p><p>heavy defeat in his first test.  Papers say that the U.S. </p><p>punished the AKP government.  "Hurriyet" says the U.S. and </p><p>Turkey have agreed that Turkish troops will enter Northern </p><p>Iraq to halt a possible wave of refugees, and that aircraft </p><p>belonging to the U.S.-led coalition will be given overflight </p><p>rights, but U.S. troops will not be stationed in Turkey. </p><p>The paper slams the government for failing to reach a </p><p>profitable agreement and then caving in to U.S. demands for </p><p>overflight.  "Aksam" highlights remarks by U/S State </p><p>Grossman saying that the U.S. could extend a compensation </p><p>fee to Turkey if the GOT takes steps forward after the </p><p>decree is approved.  Aksam draws attention to the </p><p>considerable amount of Turkish land rented by Americans on </p><p>the Iraqi border, and the ongoing military equipment </p><p>transport to the border provinces. The paper sees this as </p><p>indicative of long term U.S. plans regarding Iraq.  A </p><p>government decree granting a six months access to Turkish </p><p>airspace for the U.S.-led coalition aircraft is to be sent </p><p>to the parliament on Wednesday.  The motion would authorize </p><p>temporary Turkish military presence in Northern Iraq to </p><p>control refugees and prevent activities of the separatist </p><p>Kurdish group PKK/KADEK.  Once the air corridor is opened to </p><p>coalition planes, ONW flights will be suspended, reports </p><p>say. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: The War on Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Possibility for change" </p><p>Murat Yetkin lists the disadvantages due to Turkish </p><p>government\'s belated act in liberal-intellectual Radikal </p><p>(3/20): "The crisis management of the AKP government </p><p>presented a failure.  It seems Ankara did not realize the </p><p>change of tone in Washington.  While the AKP government </p><p>engaged in bargaining plans for additional financial aid </p><p>with Washington prior to the parliament\'s authorization, </p><p>Secretary Powell, by asking only permission for the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>overflights, closed the door for economic aid.  . In sum, </p><p>the government acted like an amateur player who shows the </p><p>cards in his hand to the other side. . At this point, Turkey </p><p>cannot afford to decline the US request for overflight </p><p>because this will only pose a heavy blow on the Turkish- </p><p>American ties for the last 50 years.  The current picture </p><p>can be depicted as follows: </p><p>- The US has given up the northern front option from Turkey. </p><p>The ongoing site modernization might be used for possible </p><p>humanitarian reasons or rescue operations. </p><p>- There are conflicting statements about the Turkish </p><p>presence in northern Iraq.  Turkish government sources say </p><p>that in exchange for the overflight permission, Secretary </p><p>Powell accepted in principle the Turkish military presence </p><p>in northern Iraq.  However, the American sources say that </p><p>Turkish incursion into northern Iraq should only be for the </p><p>humanitarian purposes and carried away with non-combating </p><p>troops.  It seems the basic worries earlier expressed by the </p><p>Turkish Chief of General Staff General Staff General are </p><p>happening. </p><p>- The government says that the agreement for political and </p><p>military cooperation with the US remains valid, but the </p><p>recent agreement reached with the Iraqi opposition looks </p><p>like something written on ice. </p><p>- The government announced that Washington was going to make </p><p>a statement for economic support, and it was in fact a three- </p><p>paragraph statement issued by the US Embassy in Ankara. The </p><p>US just repeated the stereotype rhetorical support for </p><p>Turkey and that it would continue as long as the economic </p><p>program is implemented. Hopes for up to $24 billion American </p><p>loans for Turkey however faded away. . According to the </p><p>Ankara observers, lots of things can change prior to the </p><p>debate on allowing overflights and the vote in the </p><p>parliament." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It is too late for Turkey" </p><p>Yalcin Dogan notes that Turkey cannot be a part of the </p><p>northern front even if it wants to be, in the mass appeal </p><p>Hurriyet (3/20):  "Even if Turkey grants the necessary </p><p>permission, the transfer of US troops from Turkey to </p><p>northern Iraq will take at least two weeks.  Because of the </p><p>lateness in the action, the US seems not consider such </p><p>possibility as an option any more.  With the exception of </p><p>overflight permission, the authorization for the deployment </p><p>of troops or their transit movement from Turkish soil will </p><p>not do any good to the US, militarily speaking.  Oddly </p><p>enough, the AKP government is not aware of this fact, and </p><p>still tries to bargain with the US. . As clearly seen at the </p><p>ATC meetings, the Washington administration is being </p><p>extremely distant to Ankara.  In fact, Washington is making </p><p>fun of the AKP government.  The government might be faced </p><p>with immediate consequences on April 24 ("Armenian Genocide" </p><p>Day).  Let\'s not be surprised at all if the Congress </p><p>suddenly decides to pass the Armenian resolution." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
