CONFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON THE DAY AFTER U.S. RECOGNITION OF THE </p><p>REPUBLICS OF CROATIA AND SLOVENIA, WE BELIEVE IT </p><p>WOULD BE HELPFUL TO CATCH OUR BREATH AND TAKE AN </p><p>ACCOUNTING OF WHERE WE ARE, HOW WE GOT TO THIS POINT </p><p>AND SOME EARLY IMPRESSIONS ON HOW WE SEE OUR </p><p>RELATIONS DEVELOPING WITH THESE NEW EUROPEAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00527  01 OF 07  091302Z </p><p>NATIONS.  IN THE CASE OF SLOVENIA, OUR VIEW IS THAT, </p><p>WITHOUT STRONG, OUTWARD-LOOKING LEADERSHIP, THE TINY </p><p>REPUBLIC COULD CONCEIVABLY FALL OFF THE RADAR SCREEN </p><p>(ONCE THE YUGOSLAV CRISIS PASSES WHICH WILL OBVIOUSLY </p><p>NOT OCCUR ANYTIME SOON).  DESTINED TO FALL PREY TO A </p><p>GERMAN-AUSTRIAN-ITALIAN SUZERAINTY BY VIRTUE OF ITS </p><p>SIZE AND GEOGRAPHY, SLOVENES ARE ALREADY EXPRESSING </p><p>PREVIOUSLY INDETECTABLE ANGST OVER DOMINATION BY </p><p>THEIR POWERFUL NEIGHBORS.  REGRETTABLY, WE CONCLUDE </p><p>THAT THIS ECONOMIC TURN OF EVENTS IS UNAVOIDABLE.  WE </p><p>WOULD ALSO NOT BE SURPRISED IF SLOVENIA TOOK THE LEAD </p><p>IN TRYING TO REBUILD YUGOSLAV ECONOMIC LINKAGES. </p><p>WITH SLOVENIA NOT POSING A THREAT TO ITS NEIGHBORS, </p><p>ITS NASCENT DEMOCRACY NOT AT RISK AND NO HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>PROBLEMS, THE U.S. HAS NO STRATEGIC INTERESTS AT </p><p>STAKE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  CROATIA, ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL REMAIN OF KEEN </p><p>INTEREST TO U.S. POLICY-MAKERS.  CROATIAN-SERBIAN </p><p>RELATIONS COULD WELL BE THE KEY ISSUE IN THE BALKANS </p><p>FOR YEARS TO COME.  ALWAYS SLOW OFF THE MARK </p><p>VIS-A-VIS THE SLOVENES, THE CROATS WERE LESS PREPARED </p><p>FOR THIS HISTORIC STEP.  ITS DEMOCRACY IS MORE </p><p>FRAGILE THAN THAT OF ITS NORTHERN NEIGHBOR, WITH </p><p>MAJOR ISSUES OF PRESS FREEDOMS, A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL </p><p>LEGAL SYSTEM, AND TROUBLESOME DRIFT OF THE POLITICAL </p><p>CENTER OF GRAVITY TO THE RIGHT.  CROATIAN PRESIDENT </p><p>TUDJMAN, AS THE MAN WHO DELIVERED ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RECOGNITION, SEEMS A SURE BET FOR A SECOND TERM.  HE </p><p>WILL FACE THE TOUGH TASK OF DISMANTLING, OR LEAST </p><p>DIMINISHING THE IMPACT, OF A SECURITY AND MILITARY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00527  01 OF 07  091302Z </p><p>APPARATUS THAT THREATENS TO STRANGLE EVEN THE RIGHTS </p><p>AND PRIVILEGES OF LOYAL CROATS.

END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>SLOVENIA: FROM LEADING ROLE TO BIT PLAYER </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  WHEN THE HISTORY OF THE BREAKUP OF YUGOSLAVIA IS </p><p>FINALLY WRITTEN, ONE OF THE THE SMALLEST REPUBLICS IN </p><p>THE FORMER FEDERATION WILL BE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING </p><p>PLAYED THE KEY ROLE IN MOVING YUGOSLAVIA WESTWARD </p><p>TOWARD DEMOCRACY, A TREND WHICH WOULD ULTIMATELY SET </p><p>THE STAGE FOR THE COUNTRY\'S DEMISE.  WITH ITS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00527  02 OF 07  091303Z </p><p>REPUBLIC-LEVEL ELECTIONS IN 1990, SLOVENIA CONDUCTED </p><p>THE FIRST FREE BALLOTING IN YUGOSLAVIA, A WATERSHED </p><p>EVENT THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO CALLS IN THE </p><p>OTHER REPUBLICS FOR FREE ELECTIONS.  IN A DOGGED AND </p><p>DETERMINED FASHION WHICH FLOWS NATURALLY FROM THE </p><p>SLOVENE NATIONAL CHARACTER, THE NORTHERN REPUBLIC SET </p><p>A COURSE TOWARD DEMOCRACY BUT ALSO AWAY FROM </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA AND SIMPLY REFUSED TO BE TURNED AROUND. </p><p> </p><p>5.  TO REACH ITS GOAL, SLOVENIA FORGED AN ALLIANCE OF </p><p>CONVENIENCE WITH CROATIA TO CHALLENGE A RECALCITRANT, </p><p>CENTRALIST FEDERAL SYSTEM.  WHETHER THE INTENTION </p><p>FROM THE BEGINNING WAS TO BREAK UP YUGOSLAVIA AS IT </p><p>THEN EXISTED WILL NEVER BE KNOWN (WE SUSPECT THAT IT </p><p>ALWAYS WAS).  SLOVENE HISTORY WILL RECALL THAT </p><p>BELGRADE WAS NEVER WILLING TO ENTERTAIN THE IDEA OF </p><p>RESTRUCTURING YUGOSLAVIA INTO THE MORE DEMOCRATIC, </p><p>LOOSE CONFEDERATION OF SOVEREIGN STATES PROPOSED BY </p><p>SLOVENIA AND SUPPORTED BY ITS NOMINAL ALLY, CROATIA. </p><p>THE HOLLOW TALKS THAT WERE HELD THROUGHOUT THE LATTER </p><p>HALF OF 1990 AND THE FIRST HALF OF 1991 BETWEEN THE </p><p>SIX REPUBLICS LED INEXORABLY TO WHERE SLOVENIA WANTED </p><p>TO BE FROM THE BEGINNING, THE DECLARATION OF AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT AND SOVEREIGN REPUBLIC IN JUNE, 1991. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ODDLY, SINCE ITS INDEPENDENCE DECLARATION AND </p><p>BRIEF WAR OF "LIBERATION", SLOVENIA\'S ROLE IN THE </p><p>CONTINUING UNRAVELLING OF YUGOSLAVIA HAS DIMINISHED </p><p>TO THAT COMMENSURATE WITH ITS SIZE.  WITH BROAD </p><p>RECOGNITION IN THE BAG, THE SLOVENES\' INTEREST IN THE </p><p>BRUSSELS PROCESS IS NOW CONFINED TO SUCCESSION STATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00527  02 OF 07  091303Z </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>A FUTURE SHAPED BY GEOGRAPHY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00527  03 OF 07  091304Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-01   AMAD-01  CIAE-00  CTME-00  C-01     DODE-00 </p><p>      CISA-02  EB-01    EXIM-06  E-01     FRB-03   HA-09    H-01 </p><p>      INRE-00  INR-01   IO-19    ITC-01   JUSE-00  LAB-04   L-03 </p><p>      ADS-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-08  PA-01    PM-01 </p><p>      PRS-01   P-02     SCT-03   SNP-01   SP-01    SSO-00   SS-01 </p><p>      STR-20   TRSE-00  T-01       /098W </p><p>                  ------------------252989  091304Z /38 </p><p>O 091246Z APR 92 </p><p>FM AMCONSUL ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0711 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY LISBON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUXEMBOURG </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RUFHFR/AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00527  03 OF 07  091304Z </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USIA WASHDC 1379 </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p> COMSIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON//N24// </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ5// </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC 0302 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 07 ZAGREB 00527 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEC; VIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSBM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, YO </p><p>SUBJECT:  CROATIA, SLOVENIA AND THE U.S.:  THE FUTURE </p><p>IS NOW </p><p> </p><p>7.  ALTHOUGH CURRENTLY STRAPPED IN A POLITICAL </p><p>STRAITJACKET AND UNABLE TO BREAK FREE, DEMOCRACY IS </p><p>ALIVE AND WELL IN SLOVENIA.  AT SOME POINT, A NEW </p><p>ELECTION LAW WILL BE PASSED BY THE SLOVENE ASSEMBLY </p><p>AND A NEW GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PRINCIPLES AND A MARKET ECONOMY WILL BE SELECTED TO </p><p>RUN THE COUNTRY. </p><p>- </p><p>8.  WITH DEMOCRACY ITSELF NOT AT RISK OR ENDANGERED, </p><p>SLOVENES ARE OBSESSIVELY CONCERNED WITH WHAT KIND OF </p><p>COUNTRY AN INDEPENDENT SLOVENIA WILL BECOME. </p><p>DEMONSTRATING AN ANGST NOT PREVIOUSLY NOTICEABLE, </p><p>SLOVENE OFFICIALS AND ORDINARY CITIZENS HAVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00527  03 OF 07  091304Z </p><p>EXPRESSED DEEP SUSPICION OF THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF </p><p>GERMANY, EVEN NOTING THE SUDDEN INFLUX OF GERMAN </p><p>MARKS USED IN THE PURCHASE OF PREVIOUSLY SOCIALLY- </p><p>OWNED APARTMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>9.   ULTIMATELY SLOVENIA\'S DESTINY WILL BE DETERMINED </p><p>BY ITS LOCATION.  WITH NO HINTERLAND TO SPEAK OF, WE </p><p>ENVISION A SLOVENIA THAT WILL OF NECESSITY BECOME </p><p>"REGIONALIZED."  THE INDUSTRIALIZED NORTH (MARIBOR) </p><p>WILL NEED LARGE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO MODERNIZE AND </p><p>TRANSFORM ITS FACTORIES AND PLANTS.  VIRTUALLY A </p><p>SUBURB OF AUSTRIA\'S SECOND LARGEST CITY (GRAZ), </p><p>NORTHERN SLOVENIA, WHICH IS ALREADY SEEKING MORE </p><p>LOCAL AUTONOMY FROM A FARAWAY (IN THE SLOVENE </p><p>CONTEXT) LJUBLJANA, WILL ALMOST BY INERTIA FALL INTO </p><p>THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE OF SOUTHERN AUSTRIA.  TO THE </p><p>WEST, PARTICULARLY ISTRIA, ITALY IS KING.  SLOVENES </p><p>(AND CROATS, TOO) FROM THAT REGION DO NOT HESITATE IN </p><p>IDENTIFYING WITH THEIR ITALIAN ROOTS.  THIS WEEK, </p><p>SLOVENIAN (AND CROATIAN) POLITICAL PARTIES MET WITH </p><p>PARTIES FROM ACROSS THE BORDER TO ANNOUNCE THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD SEEK TO "REGIONALIZE" THEIR ACTIVITIES AND </p><p>PURSUE COMMON POLITICAL GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  IF SLOVENIA IS TO MAINTAIN SOME CONTROL OVER ITS </p><p>ECONOMIC DESTINY, RESTORING SOME SEMBLANCE OF THE </p><p>YUGOSLAV MARKET WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY. </p><p>FROM THE BEGINNING, IDEOLOGY HAS PLAYED LITTLE OR NO </p><p>ROLE IN THE DRIVE FOR INDEPENDENCE.

AS PRESIDENT KUCAN TOLD THE CG ON APRIL 8 WHEN </p><p>HE PRESENTED OUR LETTER OF RECOGNITION, SLOVENIA </p><p>EXPECTS TO HAVE THE MOST CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>U.S. FROM THE START.  WE SEE NO REASON TO QUESTION </p><p>THAT ASSESSMENT.  BUT, AGAIN, GIVEN THE NEW </p><p>INDEPENDENT COUNTRY\'S SIZE AND LOCATION, WE SEE NO </p><p>VITAL OR STRATEGIC U.S. INTERESTS.  SLOVENIA HAS NO </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS, POSES NO THREAT TO ITS </p><p>NEIGHBORS, AND HAS NO LARGE, INFLUENTIAL EMIGRE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00527  04 OF 07  091305Z </p><p>COMMUNITY IN THE U.S.  ITS DOMESTIC MARKET IS </p><p>INHERENTLY SMALL AND MAJOR U.S. INVESTMENT POTENTIAL </p><p>WILL BE LIMITED. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WITHOUT AN OUTWARD LOOKING LEADER WITH A </p><p>EUROPEAN VIEW (E.G., SOMEONE LIKE JANEZ DRNOVSEK, THE </p><p>FORMER FEDERAL PRESIDENT), SLOVENIA COULD BECOME AN </p><p>INSULAR, INWARD LOOKING COUNTRY, FEARFUL OF THE KIND </p><p>OF CHANGE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION THREATENS TO BRING TO </p><p>THE TWELVE.  BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE, SLOVENE LEADERS, </p><p>WITHOUT EXCEPTION, UNDERSTAND FULLY THE LIMITED </p><p>INFLUENCE THEY WILL HAVE ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF </p><p>THE DAY.  BUT, LEFT WITHOUT A LEADER WITH VISION, </p><p>SLOVENIA COULD FIND ITSELF MARGINALIZED.  THE ODDEST </p><p>TWIST OF FATE WOULD BE FOR THE REPUBLIC THAT TOOK THE </p><p>FIRST STEP DOWN THE ROAD TO DEMOCRACY AND EUROPE </p><p>COULD WELL END UP ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF EUROPE, A </p><p>VICTIM OF ITS SIZE AND GEOGRAPHY. </p><p>- </p><p>CROATIA: A FATE OF ETERNAL STRUGGLE WITH SERBIA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>13.
