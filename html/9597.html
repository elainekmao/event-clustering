<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001476 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION U. S. FOREIGN POLICY, BUSH\'S VISIT </p><p>TO AFRICA AND IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The July 20 editions of the two </p><p>      government-controlled weeklies - "The Sunday Mail" </p><p>      and the "Sunday News" - carried lengthy articles </p><p>      centering on United States foreign policy, President </p><p>      George W. Bush\'s visit to Africa, and another urging </p><p>      the United States to look to the United Nations for </p><p>      a new resolution on Iraq.  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "U. S., British definition of democracy </p><p>      warped," the "Sunday Mail" printed the following opinion </p><p>      piece by Munyaradzi Mugowo in which he argues: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .(President George W.) Bush and (Prime </p><p>      Minister) Tony Blair\'s arrogation that the </p><p>      Zimbabwean government has defied all democratic </p><p>      norms is a statement that is both strange and lousy </p><p>      seen in the light of the crisis of definition that </p><p>      it unwarrantedly presents to the political </p><p>      discourse.  This definitional bigotry is deliberate </p><p>      and functions on probabilistic logic, to further the </p><p>      hidden foreign policy agendas of these world </p><p>      bullies. . .It  sounds absolutely awkward to define </p><p>      as dictatorship and gross misrule, the Zimbabwean </p><p>      government\'s opposition to U. S. habit of using </p><p>      economic power to impose unjust policies as well to </p><p>      manipulate the notion of political pluralism as an </p><p>      excuse for craftily assisting the political </p><p>      ascendancy of the opposition MDC (Movement for </p><p>      Democratic Change). . .The view which the Americans </p><p>      have of themselves as selfless humanitarians is a </p><p>      mystification of their double standards which thrive </p><p>      on their habit of deceitfully sacralizing (sic) non- </p><p>      universal ideologies abstracted from a value system </p><p>      peculiar to them which they globalize as a general </p><p>      convention of good governance, in an effort to </p><p>      mobilize overwhelming support, even from victims, </p><p>      for their own self-interests pursuits.  In view of </p><p>      this, the voices of Bush and Powell, though feigning </p><p>      a moral concern with the plight and welfare of `good </p><p>      Zimbabweans\' through honeyed words, baseless claims </p><p>      and allegations which are nonetheless a clumsily </p><p>      prepared salad of hatred of President Mugabe, myths </p><p>      about the country and a string of libertarian </p><p>      voodoos, not only set the tone, but also make an </p><p>      upward adjustment to the volume of the Anglo-U. S. </p><p>      foreign policy crusades in Southern Africa.  On a </p><p>      global scale, recent world events have plainly shown </p><p>      that the U. S. has literally turned Washington into </p><p>      an informal capital of the world, and Washington\'s </p><p>      policies, doctrines and decrees, into more or less </p><p>      sacrosanct prototypes upon which a world order </p><p>      closely coterminous with any corpus of the U. S. </p><p>      overseas commerce has been modeled. . .For reasons </p><p>      much less moral than its claims, the U. S. has </p><p>      solemnly sworn to patronize the system on the globe, </p><p>      ousting alleged `dictators,\' birthing and baby- </p><p>      sitting infant Third World democracies, and raising </p><p>      the `proper\' way, weaned ones which have already </p><p>      been engrafted into the U. S.-led `global village\' </p><p>      as its faithful satellites. . . ." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Mbeki\'s diplomatic skills convinced </p><p>      Bush," Bulawayo-based Chief Reporter, Hebert </p><p>      Zharare, wrote the following op-ed in which he </p><p>      asserts: </p><p> </p><p>      "Fears of being branded a racist, and President </p><p>      Thabo Mbeki\'s diplomatic skills, were instrumental </p><p>      in U. S. President George W. Bush\'s change of stance </p><p>      on Zimbabwe after meeting the South African leader </p><p>      two weeks ago. . .Mr. Bush surprised many, </p><p>      particularly the opposition MDC (Movement for </p><p>      Democratic Change), when he said he was of `one </p><p>      mind\' with President Mbeki on the issue of Zimbabwe. </p><p>      The MDC expected Mr. Bush to intimidate President </p><p>      Mbeki to change his `quiet diplomacy\' approach </p><p>      towards Harare and renew calls for the ouster of </p><p>      President Mugabe.  However, it was Mr. Bush who came </p><p>      out of the meeting singing a different tune. . .The </p><p>      American leader\'s divide and rule tactics of </p><p>      dangling incentives to Zimbabwe\'s neighbors in a </p><p>      ploy to coerce them to support his anti-Zimbabwe </p><p>      call failed as the African leaders reaffirmed their </p><p>      previous statements that Zimbabwean problems cannot </p><p>      be solved by foreigners. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Will the U. N. bail out George </p><p>      W. Bush?" the "Sunday News" carried the following </p><p>      feature article by Jim Lobe in which he states: </p><p> </p><p>      "Make no mistake: U. S. President George W. Bush is </p><p>      in big trouble.  Whereas a week ago, Americans were </p><p>      talking about the dreaded `V\' word - for Vietnam - </p><p>      this week the dreaded `W\' word - for Watergate - was </p><p>      back in vogue, even as the `V\' word was still in </p><p>      use.  Watergate plus Vietnam is about the worst </p><p>      combination for a sitting president that anyone </p><p>      could possibly imagine.  And the almost daily </p><p>      announcement on the news that another U. S. soldier </p><p>      has been killed in an attack in Iraq. . .recalls </p><p>      nothing so much as the daily reminders on the </p><p>      evening news 23 years ago that killed the presidency </p><p>      of Jimmy Carter. . .Short of a miracle - such as the </p><p>      discovery of a cache of weapons of mass </p><p>      destruction. . .or the return of robust U. S. </p><p>      economic growth that can quickly bring the </p><p>      unemployment rate down to five percent - there is </p><p>      probably only one way that Bush can save his </p><p>      presidency at this point.  But the cost in personal </p><p>      pride and policy will be extremely high.  To save </p><p>      his administration, Bush must now essentially </p><p>      abandon the aggressive unilateralism (sic) that has </p><p>      dominated his foreign policy since even before 11 </p><p>      September 2001; ask forgiveness from U. S. allies </p><p>      who refused to join his `coalition of the willing\' </p><p>      in Iraq; and return to the United Nations Security </p><p>      Council for a new resolution that will give the </p><p>      world body control over the occupation. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
