JAMES NICHOLSON, </p><p>REASONS:  1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04376  01 OF 02  091559Z </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  BURUNDI PRESIDENT BUYOYA, ATTENDING A </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO CONFERENCE IN PALERMO ON CONFLICT AND DIALOGUE, </p><p>REQUESTED A MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON SEPTEMBER 1 TO </p><p>REINFORCE HIS INTEREST IN STEPPED UP U.S. AND TANZANIAN </p><p>PRESSURE ON THE CNDD FACTION OF THE FDD.  MEETING AT THE </p><p>SUGGESTION OF THE SANT\'EGIDIO MEDIATOR INVOLVED IN BURUNDI, </p><p>DON MATTEO ZUPPI, BUYOYA SAID HE BELIEVED THE U.S. SHOULD </p><p>BOTH APPROACH THE FACTION DIRECTLY THROUGH ITS CONTACTS WITH </p><p>THEM IN TANZANIA, AND ALSO URGE THE TANZANIAN GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>DO MORE TO PRESSURE THE FACTION TO PARTICIPATE SERIOUSLY IN </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  AMBASSADOR URGED BUYOYA TO APPROACH OUR </p><p>EMBASSY IN BUJUMBURA DIRECTLY, BUT PROMISED TO PASS ALONG THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S CONCERNS TO OUR EMBASSY AND WASHINGTON.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>BUYOYA FRUSTRATED BY CNDD/FDD RECALCITRANCE </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BURUNDI PRESIDENT BUYOYA, KEYNOTE SPEAKER AT THE </p><p>ANNUAL SANT\'EGIDIO INTER-FAITH CONFERENCE, "FAITHS AND </p><p>CULTURES WITHIN CONFLICT AND DIALOGUE," (SEPTEL) REQUESTED A </p><p>MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON AT THE SUGGESTION OF FATHER </p><p>DON MATTEO ZUPPI, SANT\'EGIDIO\'S SPIRTUAL LEADER AND AFRICA </p><p>EXPERT, WHO HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN BURUNDI AND THE REGION FOR </p><p>MANY YEARS.  BUYOYA OUTLINED FOR THE AMBASSADOR THE STATE OF </p><p>PLAY IN BURUNDI, STRESSING THAT ALTHOUGH MUCH PROGRESS HAS </p><p>BEEN MADE, THE GOVERNMENT\'S INABILITY TO BRING THE REMAINING </p><p>TWO REBEL FACTIONS INTO THE PEACE PROCESS, AND THEIR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04376  01 OF 02  091559Z </p><p>UNWILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO A CEASE-FIRE THREATENS THE </p><p>PROGRESS TO DATE.  ACCORDING TO BUYOYA, THE CNDD/FDD </p><p>CONTINUES TO FIND "PRETEXTS" TO AVOID SUBSTANTIVE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS, SUCH AS INSISTING THAT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT </p><p>WAS NOT A COMBATANT, AND THEREFORE ONLY THE ARMY COULD BE </p><p>INVOLVED IN CEASE-FIRE NEGOTIATIONS.  BUYOYA SAID HE HAD </p><p>REQUESTED INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT -- PARTICULARLY FROM TANZANIA </p><p>-- TO CONVINCE THE CNDD/FDD TO ENGAGE SERIOUSLY IN </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS, BUT THAT THE REBEL GROUP "CONTINUED TO PLAY A </p><p>DELAYING GAME." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>U.S. PRESSURE NEEDED </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) BUYOYA SAID HIS GOVERNMENT HAD CONCLUDED THAT ONLY </p><p>THE U.S., WORKING WITH TANZANIA, COULD OVERCOME THE CURRENT </p><p>STALEMATE.  NOTING THAT U.S. ENGAGEMENT IN THE GREAT LAKES, </p><p>SUDAN, AND ANGOLA HAD LED TO SOLUTIONS, HE BELIEVED SIMILAR </p><p>ENGAGEMENT NOW IN BURUNDI WOULD BE PIVOTAL.  DESPITE CURRENT </p><p>FRUSTRATIONS, HE BELIEVED THE "TIME WAS RIPE FOR A SOLUTION." </p><p> OBSERVING THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE CNDD/FDD REBEL LEADERS </p><p>WERE "WELL-KNOWN" TO OUR EMBASSY IN TANZANIA, HE URGED THE </p><p>U.S. TO PRESSURE THE LEADERS DIRECTLY TO ENTER NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p>IN ADDITION, HE URGED US TO APPROACH THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>TANZANIA TO STEP UP THEIR PRESSURE ON THE FDD/CNDD.  HE </p><p>BELIEVED THAT TANZANIA HAD "ALL THE NECESSARY WEAPONS TO PUSH </p><p>THEM," BUT NEEDED MORE PRESSURE FROM THE U.S. TO BRING THEM </p><p>TO BEAR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THANKED BUYOYA FOR SHARING HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04376  01 OF 02  091559Z </p><p>PERSPECTIVES AND ASKED IF HE HAD APPROACHED OUR EMBASSY IN </p><p>BUJUMBURA DIRECTLY WITH HIS REQUEST.  HE SAID HE HAD NOT, BUT </p><p>THAT HE WOULD DO SO UPON HIS RETURN TO THE CAPITAL.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ENCOURAGED HIM TO DO SO, AND PROMISED TO CONVEY </p><p>HIS VIEWS TO OUR EMBASSIES IN BUJUMBURA AND DAR-ES-SALAAM AND </p><p>TO WASHINGTON.  HE NOTED THAT THE U.S. SHARED THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>DESIRE TO BRING ALL THE REBEL GROUPS ACTIVELY INTO THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ASKED ABOUT THE REBELS\' OBJECTIVES, BUYOYA SAID IT </p><p>WAS NOT CLEAR TO HIM AT THIS POINT WHAT MORE THEY NEEDED.  HE </p><p>BELIEVED ALL THE CLAIMS THE REBELS HAD PUT FORWARD -- </p><p>DEMOCRACY, INSTITUTIONALIZING SECURITY GUARANTEES, AND </p><p>SETTLEMENT OF PAST CONFLICTS -- WERE ANSWERED IN THE EXISTING </p><p>PEACE ACCORD.  THE REAL ISSUE WAS HOW TO INTEGRATE THE REBELS </p><p>INTO THE NEW INSTITUTIONS, HE SAID.  "WE ARE READY TO GIVE </p><p>THEM ROOM," HE ADDED, "BUT WE NEED THEM TO ENGAGE SERIOUSLY." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9263 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  04376  02 OF 02  091559Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  PM-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SS-00    PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   SAS-00 </p><p>        /002W </p><p>                  ------------------E49A8A  091559Z /38 </p><p>P 091536Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO AMEMBASSY BUJUMBURA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY DAR ES SALAAM PRIORITY </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO RWANDA COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 004376 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE - MENNUTI AND AF/C, AF/E AND PRM/AF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: BY, MOPS, PGOV, PREF, PREL, SF, TZ </p><p>SUBJECT: BURUNDI:  PRESIDENT BUYOYA SEEKS STEPPED UP U.S. </p><p>AND TANZANIAN PRESSURE ON REBEL FACTION </p><p> </p><p>6.
