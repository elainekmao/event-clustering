<p>UNCLAS MADRID 15938 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, SP </p><p>SUBJECT: SPAIN:  1988 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 357278 </p><p> </p><p>JUDICIAL RESPONSES AND MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>1.  SPAIN AND THE U.S. SIGNED A SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL EXTRADITION </p><p>TREATY ON FEBRUARY 9, 1988 THAT STRENGTHENED COOPERATION </p><p>AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM BY PROVIDING THAT ANY FUGITIVE </p><p>CHARGED WITH A VIOLENT CRIME CANNOT DEFEAT EXTRADITION BY </p><p>CLAIMING HIS OFFENSE WAS POLITICAL IN NATURE.  THE USG AND THE </p><p>GOS ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING A TREATY OF MUTUAL LEGAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE (MLAT). </p><p> </p><p>2.  DURING 1988, SPAIN REPEALED ITS TOUGH ANTI-TERRORIST LAW </p><p>DUE TO A 1987 RULING COURT RULING THAT CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE </p><p>LAW, INCLUDING A PROVISION PERMITING UP TO TEN DAYS DETENTION </p><p>PRIOR TO THE FILING OF CHARGES, WERE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. </p><p>HOWEVER, MOST PROVISIONS OF THE OLD ANTI-TERRORIST LAW WERE </p><p>INCORPORATED INTO THE ORDINARY PENAL CODE.  THE NEW </p><p>LEGISLATION, WHICH TOOK EFFECT ON MAY 26, PROVIDES THAT </p><p>ARRESTEES IN TERRORISM CASES CAN BE HELD FOR UP TO FIVE DAYS </p><p>WITHOUT CHARGES BEING FILED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE SPANISH COURTS DURING 1988 CONTINUED TO DEAL STERNLY, </p><p>ALTHOUGH WITHIN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS, WITH TERRORIST CASES. </p><p>FOUR MEMBERS OF THE BASQUE TERRORIST GROUP ETA WERE SENTENCED </p><p>ON MARCH 14, 1988 TO 74 YEARS IN PRISON FOR POSSESION OF ARMS </p><p>AND EXPLOSIVES, DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY AND BELONGING TO AN </p><p>"ARMED BAND."  ALSO ON MARCH 14, AN ETA MILITANT WAS SENTENCED </p><p>TO 50 YEARS ON CHARGES OF MURDER, ATTEMPTED MURDER AND OTHER </p><p>OFFENSES.  IN EARLY 1988 THE DISTRICT COURT IN MADRID, HOWEVER, </p><p>FOUND INNOCENT FIVE ALLEGED MEMBERS OF AN ETA OPERATIONAL UNIT </p><p>("COMANDO") ON THE GROUNDS THAT "SERIOUS DOUBT" EXISTED </p><p>REGARDING THEIR GUILT, AND THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE </p><p>DEFENDANTS TO THE SPANISH NATIONAL POLICE WERE NOT "FREELY </p><p>GIVEN." </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE GOS ANNOUNCED ON DECEMBER 2, 1988 A 380 MILLION DOLLAR </p><p>PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE POLICE.  ACCORDING TO DIRECTOR FOR STATE </p><p>SECURITY RAFAEL VERA, ONE OF THE PRIORITIES OF THE PLAN IS THE </p><p>STRENGTHENING OF ANTITERRORIST PROGRAMS, INCLUDING NEW COMPUTER </p><p>DATABASES AND NEW EQUIPMENT FOR THE FIELD SUCH AS ARMOURED </p><p>VEHICLES. </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>5.  SPAIN PARTICIPATES ACTIVELY IN THE TREVI GROUP AND WILL BE </p><p>TREVI PRESIDENT FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 1989.  ON DECEMBER </p><p>8, SPAIN PROPOSED THAT THE TREVI GROUP FORM A COMMITTEE TO </p><p>STUDY THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMEND COORDINATION OF </p><p>LEGISLATION AND PRACTICAL SECURITY RESPONSES REGARDING THE </p><p>OPENING OF EC BORDERS IN 1992, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO DRUG </p><p>TRAFFICKING AND TERRORISM.  THE GOS ALSO COOPERATES IN </p><p>ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATIONS ON A BILATERAL BASIS, AS DEMONSTRATED </p><p>BY THE JOINT U.K.-GOS EFFORT THAT RESULTED IN THE SHOOTING OF </p><p>THREE IRA TERRORISTS IN GIBRALTAR ON MARCH 6, 1988.  THE </p><p>TERRORISTS HAD BEEN UNDER OBSERVATION BY THE SPANISH POLICE FOR </p><p>MONTHS BEFORE THEY ENTERED GIBRALTAR FROM SPAIN.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>FRANCE AND SPAIN MAINTAIN A POLICE LIAISON OFFICE TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>ANTI-TERRORIST COOPERATION. </p><p> </p><p>NO SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  THE GOS DOES NOT SUPPORT, EITHER FINANCIALLY OR </p><p>DIPLOMATICALLY, ANY INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THE </p><p>PLO MAINTAINS A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN MADRID THAT DOES NOT </p><p>HAVE DIPLOMATIC STATUS.  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE NATURE </p><p>OF THIS OFFICE SINCE 1987; THE GOS DECLINED A 1987 PLO REQUEST </p><p>FOR DIPLOMATIC STATUS. </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
