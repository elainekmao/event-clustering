<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ATHENS 19586 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, GR </p><p>SUBJECT:  GREECE:  1988 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 357278 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  FOLLOWING IS THE EMBASSY\'S SUBMISSION FOR THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S UNCLASSIFIED ANNUAL REPORT TO THE </p><p>CONGRESS ON TERRORISM IN 1988. </p><p> </p><p>2.  1988 WAS A VERY BAD YEAR FOR COMBATTING </p><p>TERRORISM IN GREECE.  DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN </p><p>TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS INCREASED THEIR ACTIVITIES </p><p>IN GREECE DURING THE YEAR, USING MORE LETHAL MEANS </p><p>AGAINST AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF TARGETS.  AMERICAN </p><p>OFFICIALS WERE AT PARTICULAR HAZARD AND ONE U.S. </p><p>EMBASSY OFFICER WAS KILLED.  THERE WERE NO </p><p>SIGNIFICANT COUNTER-TERRORIST SUCCESSES ACHIEVED </p><p>BY THE GREEK GOVERNMENT.  IN CONTRAST, GREEK </p><p>JUSTICE MINISTERS TWICE OVERTURNED DECISIONS OF </p><p>GREEK COURTS AND PERMITTED TERRORISTS WANTED IN </p><p>ITALY TO GO FREE.  THE GREEK GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS </p><p>ITS RHETORICAL POSITION AGAINST TERRORISM, BUT THE </p><p>RHETORIC HAS NOT BEEN MATCHED BY DEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  A NUMBER OF DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUPS OPERATED </p><p>WITH IMPUNITY IN GREECE IN 1988, CARRYING OUT </p><p>REPEATED BOMBINGS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE </p><p>FACILITIES.  HOWEVER, THE MOST DANGEROUS AND </p><p>DEADLY TERRORIST ORGANIZATION REMAINS "NOVEMBER </p><p>17", WHICH CONTINUED ITS THIRTEEN-YEAR CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>MURDEROUS ATTACKS WHICH HAVE OFTEN BEEN AIMED AT </p><p>U.S. OFFICIALS.  "NOVEMBER 17" FAILED IN A JANUARY </p><p>ATTEMPT TO KILL U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY </p><p>OFFICIAL GEORGE CARROS WITH A BOMB, BUT </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY SUCCEEDED ON JUNE 28 IN </p><p>ASSASSINATING THE U.S. EMBASSY DEFENSE ATTACHE, </p><p>NAVY CAPTAIN WILLIAM NORDEEN, WITH A BOMB OF GREAT </p><p>EXPLOSIVE POWER.  ON AUGUST 14, "NOVEMBER 17" </p><p>DEMONSTRATED ITS OPEN CONTEMPT FOR GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>AUTHORITY BY SEIZING A POLICE STATION IN SUBURBAN </p><p>ATHENS, BRIEFLY DETAINING ITS STAFF AND STEALING A </p><p>STORE OF WEAPONS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT.  IN ITS </p><p>FREQUENT WRITTEN PROCLAMATIONS, "NOVEMBER 17" HAS </p><p>MANIFESTED A HIGHLY ETHNOCENTRIC AND RADICAL </p><p>POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY WHICH INCLUDES AMONG ITS </p><p>PERCEIVED DEMONS THE UNITED STATES, THE EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMUNITY, NATO, THE GREEK GOVERNMENT, ALL GREEK </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES, A MARKET ECONOMY AND ALMOST ALL </p><p>FACETS OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY.  WHILE LITTLE </p><p>OF SUBSTANCE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE INTERNAL WORKINGS </p><p>OF "NOVEMBER 17", IT HAS CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED </p><p>SEVERAL IMPORTANT QUALITIES:  RIGID INTERNAL </p><p>SECURITY, A COMMITMENT TO SELF-PRESERVATION, </p><p>METHODICAL PREPARATION AND EXECUTION OF ATTACKS, </p><p>AND A PREFERENCE FOR HOMICIDAL OPERATIONS.  OVER </p><p>THE PAST TWO YEARS IT HAS ALSO SHOWN A WILLINGNESS </p><p>AND ABILITY TO EXPAND SHARPLY THE NUMBER OF ITS </p><p>ATTACKS WHILE EMPLOYING AN EXPANDED RANGE OF </p><p>TECHNIQUES OF GREATLY ENHANCED LETHALITY.  IN </p><p>THIRTEEN YEARS OF OPERATION, NO MEMBER OF </p><p>"NOVEMBER 17" HAS EVER BEEN PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED, </p><p>APPREHENDED OR KILLED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ANY ILLUSIONS THAT GREECE COULD REMAIN </p><p>UNSCARRED BY THE SCOURGE OF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>TERRORISM SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISPELLED IN 1988. </p><p>FOREIGN TERRORISTS DEMONSTRATED THEIR ABILITY AND </p><p>INTENT TO USE GREECE AS A BATTLEFIELD AND TO MAKE </p><p>IT A VICTIM AS THEY SAW FIT.  IN APRIL, A </p><p>PROMINENT LEADER OF THE ARMENIAN SECRET ARMY FOR </p><p>THE LIBERATION OF ARMENIA ("ASALA") RESIDENT IN </p><p>GREECE, HAGOP HAGOPIAN, WAS ASSASSINATED IN FRONT </p><p>OF HIS HOUSE IN ATHENS IN AN APPARENT INTERNAL </p><p>"ASALA" DISPUTE.  IN AN EVENT WHICH ATTRACTED THE </p><p>ATTENTION OF THE WORLD JULY 11, GUNMEN USED </p><p>MACHINE GUNS AND GRENADES TO CONDUCT A MASSACRE OF </p><p>PASSENGERS ABOARD THE DAY EXCURSION BOAT "CITY OF </p><p>POROS" IN THE SARONIC GULF NEAR ATHENS.  NINE </p><p>PASSENGERS WERE KILLED AND NEARLY ONE HUNDRED </p><p>INJURED.  ONLY HOURS BEFORE THE ATTACK, AN </p><p>AUTOMOBILE PACKED WITH EXPLOSIVES BLEW UP AT A </p><p>MARINA IN PIRAEUS, THE PORT OF ATHENS, KILLING ITS </p><p>OCCUPANTS.  WHILE NO ORGANIZATION HAS CLAIMED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TWO EVENTS, WHICH WERE </p><p>ALMOST CERTAINLY CONNECTED, CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE </p><p>POINTS TO THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE PURPOSE OF THE ATTACK ON THE "CITY OF POROS" </p><p>REMAINS A MATTER OF SPECULATION, IT SEEMS LIKELY </p><p>THAT A MUCH LARGER TERRORIST OPERATION WAS IN </p><p>PREPARATION AND WENT WRONG.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO </p><p>ARRESTS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE EVENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE GREEK GOVERNMENT HAS REPEATEDLY STATED ITS </p><p>"PRINCIPLED" POSITION IN OPPOSITION TO TERRORISM </p><p>OF ALL FORMS.  THESE STATEMENTS HAVE NOT SO FAR </p><p>BEEN MATCHED BY SUBSTANTIVE COUNTER-TERRORIST </p><p>ACHIEVEMENTS.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTEDLY </p><p>INCREASED THE RESOURCES AND PRIORITY IT ASSIGNS TO </p><p>COMBATTING TERRORISM, GREEK SHIPOWNERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>IN THE FOREFRONT INTERNATIONALLY IN PROPOSING AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTING IMPROVED SECURITY MEASURES ON </p><p>PASSENGER VESSELS, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY RECEIVED </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED COOPERATION FROM GREEK </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE KILLING OF </p><p>CAPTAIN NORDEEN.  HOWEVER, IN 1988 THERE WAS ONLY </p><p>ONE ARREST (CITED BELOW), NO CONVICTIONS AND NO </p><p>EXTRADITIONS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN GREECE. </p><p>INDEED, THE CONTRARY IS THE CASE.  IN NOVEMBER AN </p><p>ATHENS COURT DISMISSED CHARGES AGAINST TWO </p><p>SUSPECTED MEMBERS OF THE "ANTI-STATE STRUGGLE" </p><p>ORGANIZATION FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY, GREEK JUSTICE MINISTERS </p><p>TWICE DURING THE YEAR OVERTURNED RULINGS BY GREEK </p><p>COURTS (INCLUDING THE SUPREME COURT) WHICH FAVORED </p><p>EXTRADITIONS OF PERSONS WANTED IN ITALY FOR </p><p>TERRORIST OFFENSES.  IN FEBRUARY THEN JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER KOUTSOYIORGAS EXERCISED HIS AUTHORITY TO </p><p>REFUSE THE EXTRADITION OF MAURIZIO FOLINI, WANTED </p><p>IN ITALY FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE "RED BRIGADES", </p><p>AND PERMITTED HIM TO GO FREE.  IN DECEMBER JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER ROTIS REFUSED EXTRADITION TO ITALY OF </p><p>PALESTINIAN ABDEL OZAMA AL-ZUMAR, WANTED FOR HIS </p><p>ROLE IN THE 1982 FATAL BOMBING OF A ROME SYNAGOGUE </p><p>BY THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION, AND ALLOWED HIM TO </p><p>DEPART FOR LIBYA.  IN BOTH CASES THE JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTERS CITED THE SUPPOSEDLY "POLITICAL" </p><p>CHARACTER OF THE CRIMES AS THE BASIS FOR </p><p>OVERRULING THE GREEK JUDICIARY.  MINISTER ROTIS </p><p>WENT SO FAR AS TO PUBLICLY REFER TO AL-ZUMAR\'S </p><p>CRIME AS "AN ACT ON BEHALF OF FREEDOM" WHICH HE </p><p>COMPARED TO THE WARTIME RESISTANCE IN GREECE TO </p><p>THE NAZI OCCUPATION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE SINGLE SUCCESS IN COUNTER-TERRORISM IN </p><p>GREECE DURING 1988 WAS THE DETENTION ON MAY 30 OF </p><p>PALESTINIAN MOHAMMED RASHID, WANTED IN THE UNITED </p><p>STATES FOR THE 1982 BOMBING OF A PAN AMERICAN </p><p>AIRLINER OVER THE PACIFIC IN WHICH A FOURTEEN-YEAR </p><p>OLD JAPANESE BOY WAS KILLED.  ON OCTOBER 10 AN </p><p>ATHENS COURT VOTED TWO-TO-ONE IN FAVOR OF THE U.S. </p><p>REQUEST FOR THE EXTRADITION OF RASHID.  AT YEAR\'S </p><p>END, THE CASE IS BEFORE THE GREEK SUPREME COURT </p><p>FOR CONFIRMATION OF THE DECISION OF THE LOWER </p><p>COURT.  UNDER THE GREEK CONSTITUTION AND THE TERMS </p><p>OF THE BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY, THE FINAL </p><p>DECISION ON EXTRADITION WILL LIE WITH THE GREEK </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN THE PERSON OF THE MINISTER OF </p><p>JUSTICE.  THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS MADE NO </p><p>SECRET OF THE GREAT SIGNIFICANCE IT ATTACHES TO </p><p>THE SUCCESSFUL EXTRADITION OF RASHID AND THE </p><p>IMPORTANT PRECEDENT WHICH WOULD BE ESTABLISHED BY </p><p>BRINGING HIM TO JUSTICE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  GREECE MAINTAINS DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH THE </p><p>PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION (PLO) AND </p><p>PERMITS A PLO OFFICE TO OPERATE IN ATHENS. </p><p>HOWEVER, GREECE HAS NOT RECOGNIZED THE </p><p>RECENTLY-DECLARED "PALESTINIAN STATE". </p><p> </p><p>9.  DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 1988 IN CONNECTION </p><p>WITH ITS ROLE AS ROTATING PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, GREECE CHAIRED THE ACTIVITIES </p><p>OF THE TREVI GROUP, A COORDINATING BODY OF LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OF EC MEMBERS TO WHICH OTHER </p><p>COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE U.S., HAVE OBSERVER </p><p>STATUS.  GREECE THEREFORE HOSTED THE SEMI-ANNUAL </p><p>MINISTERIAL MEETING OF THE TREVI GROUP IN ATHENS </p><p>DECEMBER 8-9.  THIS EVENT WAS UNFORTUNATELY </p><p>OVERSHADOWED BY THE RELEASE OF AL-ZUMAR ON THE EVE </p><p>OF THE MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>KEELEY </p><p></p></div>
