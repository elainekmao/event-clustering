(U) Classified by Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Thomas </p><p>E. Williams for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) This cable contains an action request; please see </p><p>paragraph 7. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Summary: Econoff delivered ref demarche 6/1 to UAE </p><p>Ministry of Communications Undersecretary Abdullah Ahmed </p><p>Lootah, and met with Thuraya Satellite Telecommunications </p><p>Company International Affairs Manager Mohamed Al-Ghanim to </p><p>further discuss the U.S. proposals for WRC-03.  Al-Ghanim </p><p>confirmed that the UAE, through its participation in the </p><p>Arab Common Proposal, is likely to support all of the U.S. </p><p>proposals except for Agenda Item 1.24.  He also confirmed </p><p>that Undersecretary Lootah would head the UAE delegation to </p><p>WRC-03, which will consist of representatives from Thuraya, </p><p>UAE monopoly telecom provider Etisalat, UAE media outlets, </p><p>the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs Telecom Office.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Although the Arab countries are still fine-tuning </p><p>the Arab Common Proposal for WRC-03 -- the salient points </p><p>of which appear on ITU\'s website -- Al-Ghanim outlined for </p><p>Econoff the UAE\'s position regarding the U.S. proposals, </p><p>and speculated as to how each debate would be resolved.  He </p><p>said that both the UAE and the Arab Common Proposal would </p><p>support the United States on Agenda Item 1.5 on Radars And </p><p>High Density Fixed And Mobile Services In The 5 GHz Band, </p><p>and Agenda Item 1.26 on Earth Stations On Vessels (ESVs), </p><p>although Al-Ghanim admitted that most countries will be </p><p>reluctant to sign any treaty that measures unregulated use </p><p>of ESVs from the "normal baseline" described in UNCLOS </p><p>1982.  He mentioned that Syria continues to insist that </p><p>each administration should determine its own point of </p><p>measurement. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Al-Ghanim stated that Agenda Item 1.24 on Allowing </p><p>Commercial Fixed Satellite Service More Access Into The </p><p>13.75-14.0 GhZ Band is very controversial, but is the most </p><p>important item for both the Arab countries (because of </p><p>Arabsat) and the United States.  Our interlocutor admitted </p><p>that he is burdened by his responsibility to coordinate the </p><p>Arab countries\' position on Agenda Item 1.24, which is </p><p>"very political."  The UAE and Thuraya, furthermore, do not </p><p>have a direct interest in Agenda Item 1.24, but Al-Ghanim </p><p>hopes to find a middle-ground among the Arab countries.  He </p><p>has heard from his EU colleagues that a number of European </p><p>countries will abandon the EU position on 1.24 and support </p><p>either the U.S. or Arab proposal. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Agenda Item 1.31 on Additional Allocations To The </p><p>Mobile Satellite Service In The 1-3 Ghz Band is one of the </p><p>few topics in which the UAE -- and Thuraya, in particular - </p><p>- has a direct interest.  The L Band spectrum that Thuraya </p><p>currently uses is nearing saturation, and the company\'s </p><p>future depends on allocation of a different band.  Thuraya </p><p>has lobbied for MMS spectrum allocation since WRC-97, and </p><p>Al-Ghanim noted that WRC-03 is the company\'s last shot </p><p>until the next WRC in 2007.  If Thuraya is permitted to use </p><p>MMS spectrum, it is likely that Boeing would build the </p><p>third Thuraya satellite to use this spectrum.  Al-Ghanim </p><p>said that 17 of the 22 member countries have agreed to </p><p>support allocation of MMS into regions 1 and 3 at the WRC- </p><p>03.  The Emirati official acknowledged that the FCC could </p><p>block approval of the proposal, but Thuraya believes it has </p><p>received assurances from DoD that the USG will support the </p><p>UAE\'s initiative. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment and action request: Al-Ghanim is a very </p><p>competent technocrat and negotiator, having graduated from </p><p>Etisalat Technical College several years ago.  He is an </p><p>Etisalat officer, seconded to Thuraya specifically for the </p><p>purpose of coordinating the Arab Common Proposal for WRC- </p><p>03.  Al-Ghanim asked Post to relay the message that the UAE </p><p>delegation would like to meet with U.S. officials in Geneva </p><p>just prior to, or at the beginning of, WRC-03.  He said </p><p>"there are a lot of issues to work out with the U.S. team </p><p>in advance."  Such a meeting may provide an opportunity for </p><p>the U.S. delegates to seek concessions from the Emiratis on </p><p>Agenda Items 1.24 and 1.31.  Post would appreciate any </p><p>guidance that we could pass to our interlocutor regarding </p><p>the possibility for such a meeting.  End comment and action </p><p>request. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
