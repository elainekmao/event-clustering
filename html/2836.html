<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001035 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: STANDARD EDITOR BIDS FAREWELL, URGES </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD DEMOCRACY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under the title "A luta continua" ("the struggle </p><p>   continues") the independent weekly "The Standard\'s" </p><p>   April 18 editorial was a farewell from editor March </p><p>   Chavhunduka and a call for Zimbabwe to continue seeking </p><p>   democracy. Chavhunduka, who was tortured by Zimbabwean </p><p>   military authorities in early 1999 for publishing an </p><p>   article alleging an attempted coup in the Zimbabwean </p><p>   Army, has edited the newspaper since its launch in </p><p>   1997.  He has recently acquired Thompson Publishing </p><p>   Company and will leave the "Standard" to take over </p><p>   management of his new company. Chavhunduka was an IV </p><p>   grantee in 1992.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   ". . .Despite all the trials and tribulations that </p><p>   I and colleagues have gone through and at the hands of </p><p>   an increasingly intolerant and paranoid regime, and </p><p>   having suffered the same injustices as thousands of </p><p>   Zimbabweans, many of whose stories have never hit </p><p>   newspaper headlines, I strongly believe that all </p><p>   Zimbabweans who cherish the ideals of a free, open and </p><p>   democratic society should close ranks to fight to the </p><p>   end the lawlessness, corruption, and anarchy prevailing </p><p>   in the country.  There is power in numbers.  No amount </p><p>   of twisting election results or murdering of people can </p><p>   sustain an illegitimate government forever, and so it </p><p>   is important that Zimbabweans not lose hope over the </p><p>   outcome of one presidential or parliamentary election, </p><p>   but continue to stand firm and united in the demand for </p><p>   the country to return to civilized normalcy.  Once </p><p>   anarchy sets in among the people, then that is </p><p>   tantamount to handing the country over to the devil on </p><p>   a silver platter.  We at \'The Standard\' can safely say </p><p>   we have consistently played our part in this endeavor, </p><p>   and it is my hope and belief that the paper will </p><p>   continue along the path, despite the minefields ahead. </p><p>   The paper will not falter. . .   We remain together in </p><p>   the struggle for peace and justice." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
