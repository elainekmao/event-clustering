<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 002892 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VICE PRESIDENT ATIKU MULLS A PROMOTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2862 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASONS 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Vice President Atiku Abubakar wants to be </p><p>Nigeria\'s next President; however, he no longer wants to wait </p><p>for 2007.  Competing ambitions and mutual mistrust have </p><p>placed Atiku and Obasanjo on a collision course. Atiku thinks </p><p>he can snatch the PDP Presidential nomination from an </p><p>unpopular, weakened Obasanjo. However, an open challenge to </p><p>Obasanjo would be untidy, cause convulsions within the PDP, </p><p>and increase the sense of political uncertainty throughout </p><p>Nigeria. As Atiku inches closer to his decision on </p><p>challenging Obasanjo, he also must gauge how many of his </p><p>ostensible supporters pushing him are genuine or whether </p><p>their efforts are designed to turn Obasanjo and Atiku into </p><p>enemies. Instinctually, Atiku may be a better politician than </p><p>Obasanjo, but  Atiku is also more representative of Nigeria\'s </p><p>traditional monetized politics than the reformist, too often </p><p>coarse Obasanjo.  Atiku does advocate privatization and other </p><p>economic reforms, yet he also is closely associated with </p><p>"business as usual" and allegedly a party to corruption. </p><p>Reftel reported Atiku\'s account of current events and his </p><p>role in them.  Much of what Atiku stated is true, but we do </p><p>not believe that he is nearly as passive, or as blameless, as </p><p>he claims.  This cable provides Embassy\'s assessment of </p><p>Atiku\'s role in the conundrum that is Nigerian politics </p><p>today. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Vice President Atiku occupies a position most </p><p>ambitious politicians find uncomfortable.  The safest bet and </p><p>the most statesmanlike thing would be to stand pat as the </p><p>number two on Obasanjo\'s ticket.  However, given Atiku\'s </p><p>ambition and his withering relationship with the President, </p><p>Atiku would chafe at four more years under Obasanjo.  Seeking </p><p>the top office has a compelling attraction; it is equally </p><p>foreboding.  Should he maneuver wisely, Atiku will ascend the </p><p>greasy political pole to become Nigeria\'s Chief Magistrate. </p><p>Should he make the wrong move, political oblivion would </p><p>likely be next. Moreover, history may indict Atiku for </p><p>letting personal ambition blind him to the imperatives of </p><p>national political stability. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>HOW IT STARTED </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Despite his claim that Obasanjo drafted him (reftel), </p><p>most accounts indicate Atiku was not Obasanjo\'s first choice </p><p>as running-mate.  Obasanjo initially discounted Atiku as a </p><p>customs officer with blots on his reputation. However, the </p><p>PDP\'s strength was built on two main foundations: One was the </p><p>clout of former Head of State Ibrahim Babangida and other </p><p>retired generals; the other was the PDM, the "progressive" </p><p>grassroots political network established by the late General </p><p>Shehu Yar\'Adua.  While the generals\' support was essential </p><p>getting Obasanjo\'s candidacy started and securing the PDP </p><p>nomination, Obasanjo would need PDM members as his campaign </p><p>foot soldiers to win the general election.  Atiku had </p><p>inherited the leadership of the PDM from Yar\'Adua. Atiku </p><p>became Obasanjo\'s running-mate because of this political </p><p>reality. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The two men meshed during the first two and a half </p><p>years of the Administration.  As Vice President Atiku </p><p>shepherded the economic portfolio, presiding over the </p><p>Administration\'s ambitious privatization initiative. Atiku </p><p>had wide latitude in appointing heads of parastatals and </p><p>party officials as well.  The VP maintained control of the </p><p>PDM faction within the party, albeit the PDM had weakened </p><p>since the election in 1999.  He compensated by extending his </p><p>influence throughout the party, particularly in the National </p><p>Secretariat and among PDP National Assembly Members.  Atiku </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>quietly positioned himself as perhaps the single most </p><p>influential person in the PDP machinery, eclipsing even </p><p>Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>ELECTORAL JOCKEYING MUDDIES THE WATER </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) By the end of 2001, electoral pressures began to mire </p><p>the relationship with Obasanjo.  Works and Housing Minister </p><p>Tony Anenih and NSA Aliyu Mohammed helped drive the wedge </p><p>between Obasanjo and Atiku. Wanting to be the main PDP </p><p>apparatchik, Anenih saw Atiku as a rival.  This rivalry was </p><p>compounded by Anenih\'s desire also to control the PDM, where </p><p>heretofore he was a important but lesser player than Atiku. </p><p>Anenih began canvassing Northern Governors -- particularly </p><p>Kaduna\'s Makarfi and Bauchi\'s Mu\'azu -- to possibly replace </p><p>Atiku as Obasanjo\'s second.  Anenih did not hide his </p><p>machinations, hoping Atiku would find out. Atiku did. </p><p>6.  (C) NSA Mohammed\'s reason for poisoning the </p><p>Obasanjo-Atiku relationship were less apparent but may have </p><p>been the child of Mohammed\'s own inchoate electoral ambitions </p><p>or Aliyu may have been working at the behest of Babangida. At </p><p>the beginning of the year, Babangida reportedly (and </p><p>repeatedly) delivered messages to the President that his </p><p>support was contingent on Obasanjo jettisoning Atiku. </p><p>Babangida saw Atiku as a potent rival to the mantle of the </p><p>North\'s preeminent political player and heir apparent to the </p><p>presidency in 2007. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Rumors of Atiku\'s testing the political currents were </p><p>not completely unfounded.  Notwithstanding Anenih\'s </p><p>scurrilous behavior, the unraveling of the Obasanjo-Atiku </p><p>relationship may have been pre-ordained by a combination of </p><p>Atiku\'s quiet but strong ambition and Obasanjo\'s patent </p><p>unpopularity. Early this year, Atiku tasked a group of </p><p>advisors and scholars to develop a National Development </p><p>Program, a macro-economic blueprint for Nigeria.  A more </p><p>intimate sub-group began assessing Atiku\'s and Obasanjo\'s </p><p>respective electoral prospects.  The findings that Atiku was </p><p>more popular than his boss encouraged the VP\'s thinking of an </p><p>independent political future. This undertaking commissioned </p><p>by Atiku did not go unnoticed by the Presidency. Obasanjo\'s </p><p>April electoral announcement only worsened matters.  Not only </p><p>did Anenih attempt to schedule the rally when Atiku was </p><p>abroad, when Obasanjo himself mounted the rostrum to speak, </p><p>he omitted to mention the Vice President as his running-mate. </p><p> Despite this glaring omission, Obasanjo temporized for </p><p>several weeks before making a tepid statement naming Atiku as </p><p>his running-mate. (Note: Even today, the large campaign signs </p><p>only display Obasanjo\'s name. END Note.) For the second time, </p><p>political necessity forced an unenthusiastic Obasanjo to </p><p>embrace Atiku, their partnership returning to its original </p><p>form as the political equivalent of a shotgun wedding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>IMPEACHMENT - THE MAJOR OPENING </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The relationship between the President and Atiku </p><p>deteriorated swiftly. Supporters within and without the party </p><p>pressured Atiku to announce his candidacy; speculation about </p><p>the VP\'s intentions became a regular media theme. Moreover, </p><p>the National Assembly\'s impeachment threat furthered Atiku\'s </p><p>leaning toward going it alone, and the jury is out whether </p><p>Atiku helped orchestrate the impeachment move. However, as </p><p>Atiku himself admits, he has not used his considerable </p><p>political influence to rescue Obasanjo. Atiku\'s claim that </p><p>his passivity is a result of accusations of betrayal by </p><p>Obasanjo\'s advisors is convenient but unconvincing. If </p><p>Atiku\'s interests were served by Obasanjo emerging unscathed </p><p>from the impeachment threat, he would have pitched a helping </p><p>hand.  This also would have been the best way to refute </p><p>allegations of betrayal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>AN ATIKU CANDIDACY: PROBABLE, BUT STILL UNCERTAIN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) A recent meeting of the PDP Board of Trustees was </p><p>devoted to a discussion of an alternative to Obasanjo. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s foes are becoming more numerous and bolder in </p><p>their pronouncements, sensing  his weakness and inability to </p><p>sanction them for opposing him.  Obasanjo is in real danger </p><p>of losing the PDP nomination. Atiku could help resuscitate </p><p>Obasanjo\'s chances with a strong show of support; however, he </p><p>seems more interested in positioning himself to take </p><p>advantage of Obasanjo\'s decline.  Atiku is pacing on the </p><p>sidelines, giving tacit encouragement to Obasanjo\'s foes and </p><p>hoping that growing opposition within the party will grind </p><p>Obasanjo\'s reelection dreams to a halt.  He probably hopes </p><p>Obasanjo will decide to throw in the towel and not seek </p><p>renomination.  This would minimize future accusations of </p><p>betrayal.  If Obasanjo proves stubborn and continues with his </p><p>candidacy, Atiku may wait until the last minute to publicly </p><p>break with the President. By that time and with Obasanjo </p><p>facing a wall of opposition, Atiku could be "drafted" as the </p><p>only candidate that represents both newness and continuity, </p><p>thus reconciling the fragments of an internally embattled </p><p>political party. (Note: However, we have heard from one </p><p>source that Atiku tendered his resignation late September but </p><p>was persuaded to retract it. We cannot substantiate this and </p><p>Atiku did not confirm this during his frank discussion </p><p>reported reftel. End Note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Atiku would be a formidable candidate.  Over the </p><p>years, particularly the last three as Vice President, he has </p><p>amassed a sizable fortune through both legitimate and </p><p>questionable means.  Taking a page from the Babangida manual, </p><p>Atiku has spread his largesse wisely, developing a network of </p><p>elected politicians, traditional leaders, government </p><p>officials and businessmen who owe him favors. While, in its </p><p>totality, his network is not as influential or affluent as </p><p>Babangida\'s, it likely surpasses those of any other </p><p>politician. However, an important consideration for Atiku is </p><p>the substantial overlap between his network and Babangida\'s. </p><p>Many of the same businessmen who profited from their ties to </p><p>Babangida in the early nineties have a similar relationship </p><p>with Atiku now. The question of who controls the loyalty of </p><p>these figures may be a key factor in a Babangida-Atiku </p><p>contest for influence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) While a formidable candidate, hurdles standing in </p><p>Atiku\'s way include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Obasanjo:  If he fails to win re-nomination, Obasanjo will </p><p>blame Atiku. He could well use the rest of his tenure to </p><p>reign vindictiveness on the Vice President, seeking to block </p><p>his PDP nomination and his election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- North: Atiku is not well respected by many in the Northern </p><p>political class.  He is not from the Northwest, the heart of </p><p>the region\'s political power, and is considered an upstart of </p><p>modest pedigree.  Moerover, some see Atiku, although a </p><p>Moslem, as anti-Islamic because of his public statements </p><p>against Shari\'a. Fort his and other reasons, he has been in a </p><p>running feud with the ACF, the principal Northern political </p><p>organization. Finally, many northerners see Atiku as having </p><p>done far too little for their region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Southwest: If seen as having torpedoed Obasanjo, Atiku </p><p>would face opposition in the Southwest. While not enamored </p><p>with Obasanjo, many Yorubas would still see Atiku\'s candidacy </p><p>as the beginning of the dreaded return to national power of </p><p>the Northern elite, even though Atiku is disliked by many </p><p>Northerners.  One way to minimize this backlash would be to </p><p>select a Yoruba running mate. Longtime friend Lagos State </p><p>Governor Bola Tinubu has been rumored for that slot. </p><p>However, bringing Tinubu into the PDP from the AD would cause </p><p>ripples within the PDP and possible opposition from the AD. </p><p>While the Southwest could be especially problematic, Atiku </p><p>has also tried to court governors from the South-South and </p><p>Southeast as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Religion: Although Atiku is not considered a devout </p><p>Moslem, religious tensions could grow if he fails to choose a </p><p>Christian running mate. (Tinubu is Moslem.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Disloyalty Factor: While (almost) all is fair in Nigerian </p><p>politics, Atiku will be walking uncharted territory by </p><p>challenging Obasanjo.  Many Nigerians may not want to reward </p><p>him for what seems like a betrayal of the President.  Then </p><p>there is the matter of blatant hypocrisy.  Only a few months </p><p>ago Atiku publicly stated he would rather be Obasanjo\'s VP </p><p>than head his own ticket.  Atiku seems to be banking on the </p><p>belief that Obasanjo is so unpopular, the people will view </p><p>Atiku\'s challenge as a rescue rather than a  betrayal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Corruption Factor: Atiku is considered corrupt by many </p><p>people.  Obasanjo or an ally could present an "Atiku Dossier" </p><p>before the ICPC, the federal anti-corruption commission, or </p><p>to the general public.  An Obasanjo ally has already filed a </p><p>case against another Obasanjo foe, House Speaker Ghali </p><p>Na\'Abba. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>The Babangida Factor </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The Vice -President told us that Babangida has urged </p><p>him to run.  Atiku reportedly has reciprocated Babangida\'s </p><p>support with the promise to be a one-term President, thus </p><p>opening the door to Babangida in 2007.  However, taking </p><p>Babangida\'s encouragement at face value could be dangerous. </p><p>Babangida\'s baseline political objective is to remain the </p><p>North\'s preeminent political actor. Atiku represents a known </p><p>threat to that aspiration. If Atiku supplants Obasanjo, Atiku </p><p>becomes the most important political player in Nigeria and </p><p>the North by virtue of his office and the power it affords. </p><p>Moreover, the wily Babangida knows Atiku\'s one-term promise </p><p>is utterly unenforceable. Babangida probably is not </p><p>encouraging Atiku to run so that he can win, but to break the </p><p>erstwhile Obasanjo-Atiku alliance. Babangida is probably </p><p>calculating that the best way to defeat Obasanjo and Atiku is </p><p>to divide and conquer the duo by exploiting and increasing </p><p>their mutual mistrust.  By forcing Atiku\'s hand now when he </p><p>is not quite ready, Babangida would not have to contend in </p><p>2007 with an Atiku flush with the benefits of four additional </p><p>years of incumbency. Babangida\'s play could conceivably </p><p>destroy Atiku politically and irrevocably. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) The signs of the time point to Atiku challenging </p><p>Obasanjo. It is significant that the VP is not helping </p><p>Obasanjo contend with the impeachment battle. Nowadays, the </p><p>two rarely speak or meet privately. Meanwhile, Atiku is </p><p>marshalling his strength within the party.  He is talking to </p><p>PDP State Governors and members of the party NEC. A cagey </p><p>operator, Atiku is letting others stalk Obasanjo while he </p><p>awaits the right time to move. Atiku can only gain the </p><p>Presidency in 2003 by emerging from Obasanjo\'s shadow, but, </p><p>in doing so, he also exposes himself to political jeopardy. </p><p>This is Atiku\'s dilemma. He thinks he can sprint past </p><p>Obasanjo to seize the PDP nomination, but what he does not </p><p>know is who, beside Obasanjo, will oppose his ambitions. </p><p>Atiku claims Babangida has told him to run.  However, he must </p><p>wonder if Babangida is laying in wait to ambush him </p><p>politically. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) As a candidate, Atiku presents a mix of good and bad. </p><p> Hands down, he is a more astute politician than Obasanjo. </p><p>Atiku would not commit the many insensitive blunders that </p><p>have undermined Obasanjo\'s popularity and cause so much </p><p>friction between the Executive and Legislature and the </p><p>President and the political elite. He has been a friend of </p><p>the private sector and the business community. He also is </p><p>friendly toward the United States, would seek a good </p><p>relationship and would not try to undermine our interests in </p><p>Nigeria. However, he is considered venal and has used his </p><p>position to accumulate significant business interests that </p><p>enriched him and his cronies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Atiku is an accomplished practitioner of the politics </p><p>of business as usual. As such, his commitment to fight </p><p>corruption and promote genuine economic reform is suspect. </p><p>All in all, Atiku grades much better than Obasanjo on style; </p><p>but on substance, he probably brings to the table much less </p><p>of what Nigerians need or want to secure a better and </p><p>different future. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
