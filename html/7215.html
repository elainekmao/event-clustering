<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002258 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY APRIL 8: SUCCESSFUL T-BILL </p><p>AUCTIONS RAISE NEARLY $2 BILLION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Treasury Auctions Raise Nearly $2 billion; </p><p>Yields in Line with Market Expectations </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Treasury raised a total of TL 3.26 quadrillion ($1.97 </p><p>billion) in two debt auctions on the morning of April 8. </p><p>Results were: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Maturity      Net Amt     Compounded </p><p>of Paper      Sold (quad) Interest Rate </p><p>---------     ----------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Oct. 8 Bill   TL 0.801     57 pct </p><p>Apr 24 Bond   TL 2.456     62.8 pct </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Comment: The lira appreciated nearly one percent </p><p>this morning to TL 1,632,000, and Central Bank reports some </p><p>foreign exchange inflows, but the great majority of bids in </p><p>these auctions were from local banks.  The GOT has now bought </p><p>itself a little breathing room, given that the next big debt </p><p>payments are April 24 (about $1 billion) and May 7 (about </p><p>$2.5 billion).  It needs to use this time to reduce T-bill </p><p>yields through strong IMF program implementation.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>French Delay G-7 Statement of Support </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) G-7 finance ministers issued a statement of support </p><p>for Turkey late on April 7, stating the G-7 strongly welcomes </p><p>the signing of the IMF letter of intent and the renewed and </p><p>strengthened commmitment of the GOT to advance financial </p><p>stability and economic reform.  IMF resrep (protect) told us </p><p>April 8 am that IMF staff had hoped to have the statement </p><p>released earlier, well in advance of today\'s large T-bill </p><p>auctions, but that France had delayed approval of the </p><p>statement, for technical rather than policy reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOT Appoints Two Central Bank Board Members; </p><p>Hints at Replacing Treasury Undersecretary </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On April 7, the Government replaced two Central </p><p>Bank Board members at the Central Bank\'s regularly scheduled </p><p>annual meeting.  The two new Board members are:  Durmus </p><p>Yilmaz, a Deputy DG of the Central Bank\'s markets department </p><p>and Embassy contact; and Dr. Mustafa Ilker, an economics </p><p>professor from Uludag University.   Central Bank official </p><p>Ikler Domac told us Yilmaz is a religious Muslim, but not </p><p>known to be close to AKP and is well respected at the CBT. </p><p>The second appointee, Mustafa Ilker is an AKP cadre and close </p><p>to MP Nazim Ekren. There are six GOT-appointed Central Bank </p><p>board members, each has a three-year term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Also on April 7, MinState Babacan commented to </p><p>Reuters about the rumors that Treasury U/S Faik Oztrak will </p><p>soon be replaced. Babacan said, "There is no definite </p><p>decision but that doesn\'t mean there will not be a change. </p><p>There could be a change over the coming weeks."  Bloomberg </p><p>News Service on April 6, and Sabah newspaper April 8, both </p><p>report rumors that the GOT will replace Oztrak shortly. </p><p>Oztrak\'s likely replacement (according to press and our AKP </p><p>sources) is Mesut Pektas, PM Erdogan\'s deputy at the Istanbul </p><p>municipality in charge of city finances.  He also worked at </p><p>al-Baraka Turk Islamic finance house and as a Finance </p><p>Ministry inspector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Comment:  The new government should be expected to </p><p>put its own people in key positions, but the timing of the </p><p>Oztrak rumors - right before this week\'s T-bill auctions - is </p><p>bad.  JP Morgan/Chase Treasurer Gumisdis told us April 7 that </p><p>Oztrak is trusted, and getting rid of him at this sensitive </p><p>time would not help rebuild market morale.  The Central Bank </p><p>board replacements should be non-controversial.  Market </p><p>rumors say AK might use the new Board members to put pressure </p><p>on Central Bank governor Serdengecti.  However, we will hear </p><p>directly from the Governor, if such pressures materialize. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
