<p>UNCLAS  ZAGREB 001399 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR EUR/SCE AND G/TIP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, HR, Trafficking (in persons) </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA REACTION: 2003 TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS </p><p>REPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) We were called in to the Foreign Ministry on June 13 </p><p>to discuss the recently released 2003 Trafficking in Persons </p><p>report.  Dubravka Simonovic, Head of the Human Rights section </p><p>in the Department for UN and Human Rights, asked for an </p><p>explanation of why Croatia was placed as a tier 2 country in </p><p>the Department\'s 2003 Trafficking in Persons report.  She </p><p>observed that to be included in the report a country would </p><p>have to have a significant number of trafficking victims, </p><p>defined as not less than 100 victims.  She then pointed out </p><p>that there have been eight victims in Croatia, a number that </p><p>is agreed upon by NGOs, international organizations, and the </p><p>GOC. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) We explained that the assessment of a "significant" </p><p>number of victims was based not just on the number of known </p><p>victims, but also on the number of women trafficked into </p><p>Western Europe, the number of women trafficked from source </p><p>countries, the fact that one of the three known routes from </p><p>source countries to Western Europe goes through Croatia, and </p><p>the fact that the police deport many women without ever </p><p>questioning how they got into Croatia.  Based on these </p><p>factors, we think its reasonable that a significant number of </p><p>victims are trafficked through Croatia.  Simonovic summarized </p><p>that our assessment was based on an "assumption," and we need </p><p>more credible data.  Besides challenging us on the data, she </p><p>also questioned where Bosnia and Serbia and Montenegro were </p><p>on the report, and wanted to know why Macedonia was a tier 1 </p><p>country "when they have a much bigger problem than we do." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Despite the disagreement over numbers, Simonovic </p><p>affirmed that Croatia had the political will to address the </p><p>problem of trafficking, and that it wishes to work closely </p><p>with us to address the issue.  She asked what they needed to </p><p>do to come into compliance with the Trafficking Victims </p><p>Protection Act.  We provided her with a summary of activities </p><p>and deadlines from Croatia\'s National Action Plan to suppress </p><p>trafficking, approved by the GOC last November, and pointed </p><p>out how little had been implemented in the intervening time </p><p>period.  She admitted that the deadlines were not realistic </p><p>and that this issue needed to be addressed by the National </p><p>Committee.  She further bemoaned the limited availability of </p><p>GOC funding for trafficking activities, yet assured us that </p><p>the ministries allocate additional funding beyond the </p><p>approximately $16,000 available through the Government Human </p><p>Rights Office for trafficking activities. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) We later met with Ivana Werft, Secretary to the </p><p>National Committee for the Suppression of Trafficking in </p><p>Persons.  Werft has been a willing and able interlocutor on </p><p>trafficking issues, and has worked to bridge the gap between </p><p>NGO activists and the GOC on trafficking issues.  Like </p><p>Simonovic, Werft was concerned with the report\'s finding that </p><p>Croatia has a significant problem of over 100 cases of </p><p>trafficking when all agree that there have been eight </p><p>identified victims.  To illustrate the problems connected </p><p>with transit and identification of trafficking, she </p><p>rhetorically asked what border police can do, and what data </p><p>can be gleaned from a situation, when, for example, police </p><p>stop, question, and then send on their way young women from </p><p>the Balkans who are legally transiting Croatia and say they </p><p>are en route to a job in Western Europe.  Werft pointed out </p><p>that of the eight known victims in Croatia, two had been </p><p>identified while transiting Croatia, a testimony to increased </p><p>awareness and training. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The very nature of the crime of trafficking creates </p><p>serious obstacles in terms of compiling accurate and reliable </p><p>data, particularly in countries that are believed to be </p><p>primarily transit countries.  All those working on the issue </p><p>locally recognize the problem of a lack of data, yet NGOs and </p><p>the International Office for Migration (IOM) have and </p><p>continue to request donor funding solely for awareness </p><p>raising and prevention activities.  Our requests to the </p><p>Stability Pact for examples or models of good data collection </p><p>projects have not met with success. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) We had prepared both Simonovic and Werft in advance </p><p>for the tier 2 listing.  In part due to our aggressive </p><p>engagement on the issue -- for months we took every </p><p>opportunity to forewarn that we anticipated Croatia may be </p><p>listed as a tier 2 country -- both Simonovic and Werft told </p><p>us they were not surprised at the listing and had in fact </p><p>expected it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Despite the challenges to us on the numbers, the </p><p>tier 2 placement has had the predictable effect of sharpening </p><p>the GOC\'s focus on the issue.  Simonovic specifically stated </p><p>that the issue is now a priority for the GOC because the IC </p><p>has made it a priority.  As with refugee and return and </p><p>reintegration issues, where the international community </p><p>focuses, the GOC responds.  We will strive to maintain their </p><p>attention on this issue in the hope that increased GOC </p><p>funding and meaningful activities will result. </p><p>MOON </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
