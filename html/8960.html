<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001111 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, INR/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINR, PHUM, PREF, CE, KWMM, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lanka:  Background on federalism proposals </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1107, and previous </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Despite the serious problems that the peace </p><p>process has faced of late (see Reftels), there is still </p><p>much talk of federalist-related solutions to the </p><p>conflict between the GSL and the Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  At this point, the current </p><p>positions of the government and the LTTE on federalism </p><p>remain vague, with the two sides currently focused more </p><p>on the related issue of how to form an interim </p><p>administrative structure in the north/east.  That said, </p><p>in terms of a longer range solution to the conflict, </p><p>both sides have said they support the implementation of </p><p>federalist arrangements in the north/east within a </p><p>unified Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) As background on the complex issues involved in </p><p>any discussion of this subject in the context of Sri </p><p>Lanka, Mission provides the attached briefer on previous </p><p>federalism proposals that have been made in the course </p><p>of the conflict.  These proposals stretch back to those </p><p>made during the Thimpu talks in 1985 and include those </p><p>contained in the 1987 Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, as well as </p><p>more recent constitutional devolution proposals made by </p><p>President Kumaratunga and her People\'s Alliance party. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Mission\'s background piece on previous Sri </p><p>Lankan federalism proposals follows: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>SRI LANKAN FEDERALISM PROPOSALS: </p><p> </p><p>>> (A) 1985 - THIMPU:  In 1985, peace talks were held in </p><p>Thimpu, the capital of Bhutan.  The Thimpu talks were </p><p>the first set of peace talks held since the advent of </p><p>the ethnic conflict in 1983.  India sponsored the talks. </p><p>Four principles were placed before the GSL by six Tamil </p><p>organizations, including the LTTE.  The Tamil groups </p><p>wanted to amend the 1978 Sri Lanka Constitution and its </p><p>"unitary state" provisions to encompass the following </p><p>four points: </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka must: </p><p> </p><p>- Recognize Sri Lankan Tamils as a distinct entity; </p><p> </p><p>- Recognize an identified Tamil homeland and guarantee </p><p>its territorial integrity; </p><p> </p><p>- Recognize the inalienable right of self-determination </p><p>of the Tamil entity within this homeland; and, </p><p> </p><p>-Recognize the right to full citizenship and other </p><p>fundamental democratic rights of all Tamils. </p><p> </p><p>The first three principles were rejected by the GSL on </p><p>the grounds that they undermined the "unitary" character </p><p>of the Sri Lankan state. </p><p> </p><p>>> (B) 1987 - INDO-SRI LANKAN ACCORD AND 13th AMENDMENT: </p><p>The 13th Amendment of the Sri Lankan constitution gave </p><p>effect to the devolution provisions of the Indo-Sri </p><p>Lankan Accord signed in July 1987 by President J. R. </p><p>Jayawardene and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. </p><p>Once it signed the accord, the GSL pushed the 13th </p><p>amendment through Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>The 13th Amendment sought to devolve power to newly </p><p>instituted provincial councils throughout Sri Lanka, </p><p>including a newly amalgamated northern and eastern </p><p>provincial council.  It contained three lists detailing </p><p>the following matters:  the areas of government devolved </p><p>to the provinces (List I); the powers retained at the </p><p>center (the Reserved List, or List II); and a Concurrent </p><p>List (List III) of shared functions which were </p><p>ultimately controlled by Parliament.  The 13th Amendment </p><p>included the following key provisions: </p><p>-  In addition to Sinhala, Tamil would also be an </p><p>official language of Sri Lanka with English as a link </p><p>language. </p><p> </p><p>-  The north and east would be merged into one province </p><p>subject to a referendum. </p><p> </p><p>-  Provincial councils would be elected every five </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>-  The president would appoint an executive-type </p><p>governor for each province. </p><p> </p><p>-  Provincial high courts would be established. </p><p> </p><p>-  Financial provisions would be directed by Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>-  Decisions of the provincial councils could be </p><p>superseded by regulations promulgated by the President </p><p>under the Public Security Ordinance. </p><p> </p><p>Soon after the Indo-Sri Lankan accord was signed, the </p><p>LTTE made clear that it would not cooperate with the </p><p>Indian government.  The situation degenerated as fierce </p><p>fighting erupted in the north and east between the LTTE </p><p>and the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF), and between </p><p>the GSL and the radical JVP in the south.  In this </p><p>situation, the proposed national referendum providing </p><p>for a merged north and east never took place.  Councils </p><p>in other provinces, however, were elected in November </p><p>1988. </p><p> </p><p>>> (C) 1991 - PREMADASA PROPOSALS:  In August 1991, </p><p>under President Premadasa\'s guidance, a joint </p><p>parliamentary select committee was established to </p><p>explore ways of achieving peace and political stability </p><p>in Sri Lanka.  Mangala Moonesinghe, the current Sri </p><p>Lankan high commissioner to India and then-Sri Lanka </p><p>Freedom Party (SLFP) MP, was appointed to chair the </p><p>committee. </p><p> </p><p>The interim report of the select committee was released </p><p>in January 1993.  The report included the following main </p><p>points: </p><p> </p><p>-  The establishment of two separate units of </p><p>administration for the northern and eastern provinces; </p><p> </p><p>-  The adoption of a scheme of devolution on lines </p><p>similar to those of the Indian constitution; </p><p> </p><p>-  The devolution of more powers in List III (Concurrent </p><p>List of shared functions) of the 13th Amendment. </p><p> </p><p>The Tamil parties, including the LTTE, did not endorse </p><p>the report, complaining that it did not devolve enough </p><p>powers to a north/east unit.  Due to such criticism, the </p><p>report was never put before Parliament as a bill. </p><p> </p><p>>> (D) 1994/95 - PA\'S FIRST DEVOLUTION PROPOSAL:  The </p><p>new People\'s Alliance (PA) government led by President </p><p>Kumaratunga held peace talks with the LTTE from late </p><p>1994 through early 1995.  The government used the talks </p><p>to discuss confidence-building measures such as the </p><p>lifting of embargoes, the rehabilitation of the north </p><p>and east, including the restoration of electricity </p><p>supplies.  The GSL said it was also keen to move forward </p><p>on the framework of a political solution that provided </p><p>that elections would be held in the north and east on </p><p>whether the two areas should be merged.  The </p><p>government\'s devolution proposals were never fleshed out </p><p>fully, but it was leaning toward giving a north/east </p><p>unit at least as many rights, if not more, than were to </p><p>be given under the terms of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord </p><p>and the 13th amendment.  In the end, the talks failed, </p><p>with the LTTE re-commencing the war in April 1995. </p><p>>> (E) 1999/ 2000 - PA\'S SECOND DEVOLUTION PROPOSAL: </p><p>After several trial balloons, the PA went on to propose </p><p>a new devolution package in 1999-2000. </p><p> </p><p>Under the devolution proposals, a new constitution was </p><p>to replace the existing 1978 constitution.  The key </p><p>features of the proposal were the deletion from the 1978 </p><p>Constitution of the following key points: </p><p> </p><p>-  (i) Article 2, which states that Sri Lanka is a </p><p>unitary state; and, </p><p> </p><p>-  (ii) Article 76, which prohibits Parliament from </p><p>abdicating its legislative powers and from setting up </p><p>any authority with any legislative powers. </p><p> </p><p>Consequent to the deletion of the clause referred to at </p><p>"i" above, the existing unitary state was to be replaced </p><p>by a federation described as an "indissoluble union of </p><p>regions." </p><p> </p><p>Also, consequent to the deletion of the clause referred </p><p>to at "ii" above, Sri Lanka was to be divided into an </p><p>unspecified number of regions (believed to be 8 or 9) to </p><p>which Parliament would abdicate major legislative powers </p><p>plus executive and judicial powers.  Two of these </p><p>regions, the northern and eastern, were to be merged. </p><p> </p><p>Article 5 of the proposed constitution (in contrast to </p><p>the 1978 Constitution) would include a Tamil-language </p><p>translation of the national anthem. </p><p> </p><p>In addition, the government proposed that Sri Lanka </p><p>would have two vice presidents from different </p><p>communities with each such community being different </p><p>from the community of which the president was a member. </p><p> </p><p>In August 2000, President Kumaratunga\'s People\'s </p><p>Alliance party presented these proposals to Parliament </p><p>in a bill.  Despite a favorable response from the </p><p>minority parties, the new constitution was heavily </p><p>criticized by the then-Opposition United National Party </p><p>(UNP).  (Note:  The UNP won the December 2001 </p><p>parliamentary elections and is now in power.)  Never </p><p>approved, the bill automatically lapsed when the </p><p>Parliament was dissolved in August 2000, a few days </p><p>prior to the expiry of its six-year term. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
