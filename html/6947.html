SUMMARY:  THE WAR IN IRAQ, IRAQI CIVILIAN CAUSALITIES, </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AID, AND RUMSFELD\'S WARNINGS TO SYRIA AND IRAN </p><p>DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL </p><p>DESCRIBED RUMSFELD\'S WARNINGS AS "ISRAELI DICTATIONS."  ANOTHER </p><p>EDITORIAL IN "AL BAYAN" NOTED THAT THESE WARNINGS ARE A NEW </p><p>THREAT AGAINST ANOTHER ARAB COUNTRY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "RUMSFELD AND THE ISRAELI DICTATIONS," </p><p>SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 3/30: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE U.S. IS IMPLEMENTING AN \'ISRAELI AGENDA\' IN ITS ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ, AND WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT IRAQ AS THE FIRST STEP </p><p>IN CARRYING OUT AN ISRAELI-AMERICAN STRATEGY IN THE REGION IS NOT </p><p>ONLY AN ANALYSIS ANYMORE, THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY RUMSFELD\'S </p><p>STATEMENTS ... ARE THESE HUGE U.S. FORCES THAT HAVE ARRIVED IN </p><p>THE REGION, WHOSE NUMBERS MIGHT REACH HALF A MILLION SOLDIERS, </p><p>TARGETING IRAQ ONLY, OR IS THERE SOMETHING MORE?" </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON RUMSFELD\'S STATEMENT AND HIS WARNINGS TO SYRIA </p><p>AND IRAN, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED </p><p>3/30: </p><p> </p><p>"... THESE WARNINGS AND ACCUSATIONS REPRESENT A NEW AMERICAN </p><p>THREAT AGAINST A BROTHERLY ARAB COUNTRY, WHO AGREES WITH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS AND COOPERATED WITH THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>IN VOTING FOR UNSCR 1441.  THAT (UNSCR 1441) WAS MEANT TO PROTECT </p><p>IRAQ\'S SECURITY AND TO CONFIRM THAT DAMASCUS IS WITH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  WE DO NOT KNOW THE U.S. INTENTIONS </p><p>BEHIND THESE WARNINGS TO SYRIA." </p><p> </p><p>4.  CRITICIZING THE US AND UK FOR DOUBLE STANDARD VIS--VIS IRAQ </p><p>AND ISRAEL, UAE COLUMNIST AYSHA SULTAN WROTE IN "AL BAYAN" ON </p><p>3/30: </p><p> </p><p>"... BUSH AND BLAIR ARE CONVINCED THAT SADDAM\'S REGIME DESERVES </p><p>TO BE PUNISHED SINCE IT IGNORED 17 UN RESOLUTIONS.  THE MORAL </p><p>QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE ASKED HERE IS THE SAME THAT WAS ASKED BY </p><p>THE BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER JACK STRAW AND WHICH DISGUSTED </p><p>ISRAEL:  WHY IS ISRAEL NOT PUNISHED FOR THE SAME REASON, THE </p><p>VIOLATION OF 64 UN RESOLUTIONS?" </p><p> </p><p>5.  CRITICIZING THE MANAGEMENT OF GULF SATELLITE CHANNELS, UAE </p><p>COLUMNIST DR. SHAMLAN YOUSEF AL EISSA WROTE IN ABU DHABI-BASED </p><p>SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" ON 3/30: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE REALLY SAD ISSUE IS THAT OUR GULF SATELLITE CHANNELS </p><p>HAVE GIVEN OVER THEIR MANAGEMENT TO ARAB EXPATRIATES, WHO PLACED </p><p>THEIR BENEFITS AND THE BENEFIT OF THEIR COUNTRIES ABOVE THE </p><p>BENEFITS OF PEOPLE OF THE GULF AND THE WESTERN COALITION </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT SHARE IMPORTANT AND COMPLICATED ECONOMICAL, </p><p>COMMERCIAL, AND SECURITY RELATIONS WITH GULF COUNTRIES.  PEOPLE </p><p>OF THE GULF TODAY ARE COMMITTING THE SAME MISTAKE THE KUWAITIS </p><p>DID RIGHT BEFORE THE SECOND GULF WAR, WHEN THE KUWAITI PRESS WAS </p><p>MANNED BY OUR ARAB BROTHERS WHO MADE OUR PRESS A FORUM FOR INTER- </p><p>ARAB CONFLICTS AT THE TIME, WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION </p><p>KUWAIT\'S ULTIMATE INTERESTS AND FOR WHICH KUWAIT PAID DEARLY ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  PRAISING "THE BLESSED ARAB SATELLITE CHANNEL CAVALRIES," IBN </p><p>AL DEERA WROTE IN "AL KHALEEJ" ON 3/30: </p><p> </p><p>"PROFESSIONALISM AND OBJECTIVITY IS BADLY REQUIRED IN THE </p><p>COVERAGE OF ARAB SATELLITE CHANNELS.  IT IS ALSO NECESSARY THAT </p><p>THEY NOT SUCCUMB TO THE TRAPS LAID BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDIA WAR </p><p>FABRICATED BY THE UNITED STATES.  VICTORIES ACHIEVED BY LOCAL AND </p><p>ARAB SATELLITE CHANNELS SHOULD NOT BE OBSTRUCTED OR DISTORTED BY </p><p>AMERICA.  THE AIM OF THE AMERICAN CAMPAIGN AGAINST OUR ARAB </p><p>SATELLITE CHANNELS IS TO BLACKOUT SCENES OF THEIR MISERIES ... </p><p>BLESSINGS ON THE COURAGEOUS REPORTERS OF THE ARAB SATELLITE </p><p>CHANNELS: \'ABU DHABI,\' \'SHARJAH,\' \'DUBAI,\' \'AL JAZEERA,\' AND \'AL </p><p>ARABIYYA\' AND MOST OF THE ARAB SATELLITE CHANNELS!" </p><p> </p><p>7.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "UN MUST ACT ON AID," EXPATRIATE-ORIENTED </p><p>ENGLISH DAILY GULF NEWS EDITORIALIZED 3/30: </p><p> </p><p>"THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF IRAQ HAS TO LIE WITH THE IRAQI PEOPLE </p><p>AND THAT FUTURE STARTS WITH THE CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE </p><p>PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WHICH THE COALITION HAS TAKEN AND ARE NOT </p><p>AFFECTED BY THE FIGHTING.  EVEN IF THAT IS NOT UNDER IRAQI </p><p>CONTROL AS YET, THE UNITED NATIONS IS MUCH BETTER ABLE TO DELIVER </p><p>THE REQUIRED SUPPORT WHERE NEEDED, AND TO HAND OVER ANY ASSETS OR </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE IT HAS SET UP TO ANY FUTURE IRAQI ADMINISTRATION. </p><p>THE COALITION FORCES SHOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PROCESS." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
