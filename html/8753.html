<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001062 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO ON SECURITY ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 804 </p><p>     B. 02 ABUJA 3165 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During a June meeting, President Obasanjo </p><p>and Ambassador Jeter discussed the status of U.S. bilateral </p><p>security assistance programs.  Obasanjo was perplexed by </p><p>the impending shut-down of the MPRI program, the C-130 </p><p>restoration program, and the Nigerian Armed Forces </p><p>Resettlement Center (NAFRC) program, sponsored by the U.S. </p><p>Department of Labor.  The President immediately ordered the </p><p>payment of 1 million USD of the 3.5 million USD due the </p><p>MPRI program and said the GON would pay the balance in the </p><p>future.  He instructed newly appointed Chief of Defense </p><p>Staff GEN Alexander Ogomudia to find a shipping company to </p><p>transport FMF-purchased C-130 parts by Friday, June 13. </p><p>Obasanjo was unsure of the status of the NAFRC project and </p><p>asked Ogomudia to look into it.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>MPRI </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador Jeter reminded Obasanjo of the GON\'s </p><p>promise last November to provide 3.5 million USD for MPRI\'s </p><p>operations (REF B).  The Ambassador further reminded the </p><p>President that the program would expire on July 31 if the </p><p>funds were not forthcoming.  Obasanjo said he did not </p><p>understand why the Finance Minister, who attended the </p><p>November meeting, had not released the funds.  Obasanjo </p><p>asked the Ambassador if the GON could provide 1 million USD </p><p>in funding immediately, making up the balance of 2.5 </p><p>million USD in the future.  Ambassador said an immediate </p><p>release of 1 million USD would show good faith on the part </p><p>of the GON.  Obasanjo then directed NSA Mohammed to find </p><p>the funds immediately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>C-130 RESTORATION PROGRAM </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ambassador informed Obasanjo that the GON\'s failure </p><p>to contract a shipping company to transport FMF-purchased </p><p>C-130 spare parts from the U.S. to Nigeria could cause the </p><p>program to be cancelled.  While the MOD had identified a </p><p>company, the GON had not yet paid the 500,000 USD up-front </p><p>charges the company required.  Obasanjo seemed surprised </p><p>and wondered aloud why the GON could not use another </p><p>company.  Obasanjo then directed CDS Ogomudia to resolve </p><p>the issue by Friday, June 13. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Center </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ambassador told Obasanjo that the U.S. Army Corps </p><p>of Engineers and the Department of Labor were engaged in </p><p>programs to improve the facilities and curriculum at NAFRC. </p><p>Unfortunately, however, NAFRC is not receiving enough money </p><p>from the GON to run its DOL donated generators, let alone </p><p>operate properly.  Ambassador informed Obasanjo of DOL\'s </p><p>intention to shut down its program if NAFRC does not </p><p>receive operating funds.  Obasanjo asked Ogomudia to look </p><p>into the matter.  (NOTE: The DOL-supported NAFRC program </p><p>grew out of a direct request by Obasanjo.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: While Obasanjo\'s offer to provide 1 </p><p>million USD falls short of the 3.5 million the GON owes, it </p><p>is a step in the right direction.  These funds should allow </p><p>the MPRI program to operate until December, hopefully, </p><p>giving the GON enough time to pay the 2.5 million </p><p>shortfall.  We have informed the Ministry of Defense of the </p><p>need to provide us with a Letter of Request (LOR) to </p><p>continue MPRI no later than Monday, July 16.  MOD Joint </p><p>Service Director B.O. Williams informed ODC the morning of </p><p>July 16 that she would be attending a MOD budget planning </p><p>meeting on July 18.  She expected to have more information </p><p>on the MPRI funding and, possibly, the LOR that day.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
