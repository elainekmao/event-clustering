<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 006022 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR ADVOCACY CENTER - CHRISTOPHER JAMES </p><p>USDOC/4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p>EXIMBANK FOR ROBERT MORIN </p><p>TDA FOR HENRY STEINGASS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/16/2007 </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, EFIN, EAIR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: ROYAL JORDANIAN SEEKS TO DELAY AIRPLANE </p><p>DECISION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Samir Hanna, the Boeing VP who has been negotiating </p><p>the sale/lease package of nine 737\'s to Royal Jordanian </p><p>Airlines (RJ), reported that RJ CEO Samer al-Majali told him </p><p>October 16 that RJ was not able to make a decision between </p><p>competing Boeing and Airbus offers, as had been planned for </p><p>the first part of this month.  Majali asked Boeing to extend </p><p>the validity of their current offers and said he was asking </p><p>Airbus to do the same.  Hanna is currently checking with his </p><p>headquarters to if this can be done and for how long. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Majali told Hanna that the decision not to make a </p><p>decision was reached on the advice of the Jordanian </p><p>"government" (presumably the Prime Minister and key </p><p>ministers).  Majali said the government\'s advice had been </p><p>told to "hold off until we see what happens with Iraq."  This </p><p>advice was discussed by the RJ Board on October 15. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  According to Hanna\'s and local Boeing consultant </p><p>Peter Ledger\'s reconstruction of the sequence of probable </p><p>events, such advice most likely came from the government </p><p>within the past five days, give or take a day or two.  The </p><p>board had previously held an informal review of Boeing and </p><p>Airbus offers on or about October 2 and Majali briefed King </p><p>Abdullah on the state of play shortly thereafter.  Hanna and </p><p>Ledger had received positive, but noncommittal signals </p><p>following the first Board meeting. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Comment:  While they appreciate the uncertainties </p><p>the Jordanians may be feeling over Iraq, Hanna and Ledger </p><p>said that a delay could only work to the disadvantage of </p><p>Boeing.  They said that if RJ\'s hope was to lease aircraft on </p><p>the market instead of making a decision, RJ could find this </p><p>more difficult than it might expect given what they said was </p><p>RJ\'s poor payments track record with leasing companies. </p><p>Furthermore, leasing companies would not be able to provide </p><p>support packages equivalent to that being offered by Boeing. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Comment continued:  The Ambassador will raise this </p><p>matter directly with the King on October 20.  Based on that </p><p>conversation, we will make appropriate recommendations on </p><p>next actions. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
