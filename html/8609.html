<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003738 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: PROSECUTOR OPENS TWO CASES AGAINST WRITER FOR </p><p>10-YEAR-OLD WORKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 ANKARA 6116 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 2909 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by acting Politcal Counselor Nicholas S. Kass. </p><p> Reason: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  An Ankara prosecutor has opened two cases </p><p>against writer and scholar Fikret Baskaya for works </p><p>originally published 10 years ago.  One of the cases involves </p><p>a book for which Baskaya was convicted and imprisoned in </p><p>1994; the European Court of Human Rights later ruled in </p><p>Baskaya\'s favor in the case.  A Justice Ministry contact said </p><p>Minister Cicek opposes the indictments; he also averred that </p><p>training programs and precedent-setting appeals court rulings </p><p>will gradually prevent such cases in the future. </p><p>Nevertheless, a human rights attorney argued that despite </p><p>such good intentions, the GOT judicial bureaucracy is </p><p>unwilling to discipline prosecutors who abuse their </p><p>authority.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Prosecutor Opens Two Cases Against Writer </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) An Ankara State Security Court (SSC) prosecutor in May </p><p>opened two separate court cases against Fikret Baskaya: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- One case is related to the new edition of Baskaya\'s book, </p><p>"Collapse of the Paradigm: An Introduction to the Criticism </p><p>of the Official Ideology."  Baskaya in 1993 was convicted for </p><p>the original publication of the book, and served 15 months in </p><p>prison in 1994-95.  The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) </p><p>later ruled that Baskaya\'s conviction violated the European </p><p>Convention on Human Rights and ordered compensation.  As in </p><p>the 1993 trial, Baskaya is now charged with violating Article </p><p>8 of the Anti-Terror Law, which outlaws "written and oral </p><p>propaganda...aimed at damaging the indivisible unity of the </p><p>State."  If convicted, he could be sentenced to 2-5 years </p><p>imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The other case is related to the re-publishing of an </p><p>article Baskaya wrote in 1993 about the Sivas Massacre, which </p><p>took place that year (involving the deaths of some 37 Turkish </p><p>Alevis in a hotel fire set by rioting Sunnis).  The article </p><p>is included in a new book of selected writings.  Baskaya was </p><p>not charged when the article was first published in 1993, but </p><p>now stands accused of violating Article 159 of the Turkish </p><p>Penal Code, which forbids speech that insults the State or </p><p>its institutions.  If convicted, he could be sentenced to 1-6 </p><p>years imprisonment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Embassy Raises Concerns </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On June 6 we raised concerns about these cases with </p><p>Abdulkadir Kaya, Ministry of Justice Director General for </p><p>International Relations.  We noted that the GOT has adopted </p><p>wide-ranging legal reforms over the past two years in its </p><p>efforts to qualify for EU membership.  Outside observers were </p><p>encouraged by these efforts, and had hoped that these types </p><p>of speech cases would end.  Unfortunately, the charges </p><p>against Baskaya raise doubts about the depths of the reforms </p><p>related to free speech.  Baskaya is being charged for works </p><p>published years ago, and is being retried for his "Paradigm" </p><p>book despite having won his case in the ECHR.  We noted that </p><p>the GOT revised Article 159 in August 2002 (reftel A) and was </p><p>considering revoking Article 8 (reftel B), but prosecutors do </p><p>not appear to have changed their practices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>MOJ: Reforms Need Time </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Kaya said he is "puzzled" by the indictments, </p><p>particularly in light of the ECHR ruling.  He noted that the </p><p>GOT has been criticized for failing to abide by ECHR rulings </p><p>and this case will only complicate matters.  Kaya said he </p><p>discussed both cases with the prosecutor, who asked him for a </p><p>Turkish translation of the ECHR ruling.  He said judges and </p><p>prosecutors in Turkey are generally uninformed about the </p><p>latest reforms and ECHR rulings.  The Justice Ministry is </p><p>addressing the problem with a series of seminars, focused </p><p>particularly on SSC judges and prosecutors, but it will take </p><p>time to change attitudes.  He said the SSC will likely </p><p>convict Baskaya, but predicted the rulings will be overturned </p><p>on appeal.  He said appeals court judges tend to be more </p><p>attuned to the reform process, and their rulings gradually </p><p>set precedents for the lower courts.  In the immediate term, </p><p>"there is not much the Justice Ministry can do," he said. </p><p>"Prosecutors and judges are independent" and there is no </p><p>restriction against prosecuting someone for writings </p><p>published years ago, regardless of ECHR decisions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Human Rights Lawyer: Prosecutors Should be Held Accountable </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Yusuf Alatas, attorney and Human Rights Association </p><p>vice chairman, had a different view when we discussed the </p><p>Baskaya cases with him June 9.  Alatas argued that "judicial </p><p>independence does not mean prosecutors and judges are </p><p>responsible to no one."  He noted that the Supreme Board of </p><p>Judges and Prosecutors has the formal authority to sanction </p><p>judicial officials who act improperly, and averred that the </p><p>Board could prevent these types of "harassment" cases if it </p><p>so chose.  The problem, he said, is due primarily to two </p><p>factors: 1) the Board is dominated by "nationalist" jurists </p><p>-- along with, he asserted, a significant "Islamist" minority </p><p>-- and its members tend to oppose EU membership and human </p><p>rights reform; and 2) the Justice Minister and his </p><p>Undersecretary, who are Board members, have the power to </p><p>change the Board\'s approach, but are unwilling to use it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) These two, simultaneous cases against Baskaya are the </p><p>latest reminder that the GOT\'s impressive legislative reforms </p><p>have not changed the practices of a powerful bureaucracy </p><p>obsessed with perceived threats to the State.  The case </p><p>against the "Paradigm" book is particularly troubling because </p><p>it reflects a continued disregard for the ECHR among Turkish </p><p>judges, an attitude that in the past has raised doubts about </p><p>Turkey\'s EU qualifications. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
