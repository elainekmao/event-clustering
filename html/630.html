<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 019514 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM. PREL  PTER, TU, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  PKK AND "INSURGENCY" </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 0285 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE PKK DOES NOT BECOME ENTITLED TO ANY OF </p><p>THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS\' BENEFITS BY THE U.S. USE OF THE </p><p>TERM "INSURGENCY."  THE 1949 GENEVA CONVENTIONS DID </p><p>NOT/NOT CHANGE THE CUSTOMARY AND CONVENTIONAL LAWS OF WAR </p><p>REGARDING "INSURGENCY," AND, THEREFORE, CHARACTERIZING THE </p><p>PKK.S ACTIVITY AS A "SEPARATIST INSURGENCY" DOES NOT/NOT </p><p>IMPLY THAT THE PKK ENJOYS A RECOGNIZED LEGAL STATUS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MOST OF THE POINTS BELOW ARE DRAWN FROM A 1988 LEGAL </p><p>MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED BY THE USG TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT </p><p>FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK IN THE CASE OF U.S. </p><p>V. SHAKUR.  EMBASSY MAY PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING POINTS IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR TURMEN.S COMMENTS (REFTEL). </p><p> </p><p>4.  BEGIN POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-  SOME STATES RECOGNIZE A CATEGORY OF "INSURGENCY" BUT </p><p>ONLY FOR DOMESTIC POLITICAL OR LEGAL REASONS, IN ORDER TO </p><p>AVOID TREATING SOME REBELS AS MERE LAWBREAKERS.  SUCH A </p><p>PRACTICE, HOWEVER, IS SPORADIC AND, IN ANY EVENT\' NOT A </p><p>MATTER OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. </p><p> </p><p>-  THE CUSTOMARY LAW OF WAR THAT EXISTED BEFORE ADOPTION </p><p>OF THE FOUR GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 DID NOT PURPORT TO </p><p>REGULATE CIVIL WARS EXCEPT IN VERY NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p>UNDER THAT LAW, CERTAIN INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS COULD </p><p>BECOME INTERNATIONAL ARMED CONFLICTS FOR PURPOSES OF THE </p><p>LAWS OF WAR IF A STATE OF "BELLIGERENCY" WAS RECOGNIZED BY </p><p>STATES. </p><p> </p><p>-  IN TRADITIONAL TERMINOLOGY, AN "INSURGENCY" WAS A REBEL </p><p>MOVEMENT NOT ENTITLED TO PROTECTION UNDER THE LAWS OF </p><p>WAR.  "BELLIGERENCY" WAS A CONDITION THAT RESEMBLED AN </p><p>ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN STATES, WITH EACH PARTY </p><p>ADMINISTERING TERRITORY  ETC. (SEE BELOW).  BELLIGERENCY </p><p>WAS GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF WAR WHICH REGULATED CONFLICTS </p><p>BETWEEN STATES. </p><p> </p><p>-  THE TERM "INSURGENCY" APFLIED TO CONFLICTS LACKING THE </p><p>FEATURES OF INTERSTATE CONFLICT.  USE OF THE TERM HAS </p><p>NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED AS CONFERRING STATUS ON THE </p><p>PARTICIPANTS UNDER THE LAWS OF WAR. </p><p> </p><p>-  BELLIGERENCY EXISTED ONLY IF CERTAIN FACTUAL CONDITIONS </p><p>WERE PRESENT:  "... THE EXISTENCE OF A CIVIL WAR </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY A STATE OF GENERAL HOSTILITIES; OCCUPATION </p><p>AND A MEASURE OF ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF A SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>PART OF NATIONAL TERRITORY BY THE INSURGENTS; OBSERVANCE </p><p>OF THE RULES OF WARFARE ON THE PART OF THE INSURGENT </p><p>FORCES ACTING UNDER A RESPONSIBLE AUTHORITY; THE PRACTICAL </p><p>NECESSITY FOR THIRD STATES TO DEFINE THEIR ATTITUDE TO THE </p><p>CIVIL WAR." </p><p> </p><p>-  THIS TRADITIONAL TERMINOLOGY HAS FALLEN INTO DISUSE IN </p><p>FAVOR OF THE TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTS USED IN THE FOUR </p><p>GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 AND IN THEIR 1977 PROTOCOLS. </p><p> </p><p>-  BECAUSE OF THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF CIVIL WARS\' </p><p>THE STATES THAT MET IN GENEVA IN 1949 DECIDED TO ADOPT </p><p>COMMON ARTICLE 3 TO GOVERN "ARMED CONFLICT NOT OF AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER."  ARTICLE 3 PROVIDES A GENERAL </p><p>REQUIREMENT THAT PERSONS NOT TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN </p><p>HOSTILITIES BE TREATED HUMANELY, AND IT SPECIFICALLY </p><p>PROHIBITS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MURDER, TORTURE, </p><p>HOSTAGE-TAKING AND HUMILIATING AND DEGRADING TREATMENT. </p><p>HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT GRANT REBELS THE BENEFITS OF </p><p>PRISONER-OF-WAR STATUS AND THUS IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION </p><p>UNDER LOCAL LAW FOR LEGITIMATE COMBATANT ACTS.  THUS. A </p><p>REBEL IN A CIVIL WAR MAY BE PROSECUTED FOR MURDER IF HE </p><p>KILLS A MEMBER OF THE REGULAR FORCES OF A STATE. </p><p> </p><p>-  IN ANY EVENT, APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 3 DOES NOT DEPEND </p><p>ON WHETHER OR NOT AN "INSURGENCY" IS INVOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>-  AFTER THE CONVENTIONS WERE ADOPTED, SOME ARGUED THAT </p><p>INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS COULD BECOME "INTERNATIONAL" </p><p>ARMED CONFLICT IF "BELLIGERENCY" WERE RECOGNIZED BY </p><p>STATES.  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE PRACTICE OF STATES DURING </p><p>THE PAST FOUR DECADES, HOWEVER, THAT STATES HAVE NOT </p><p>ACCEPTED THIS THEORY UNDER THE CONVENTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-  THE 1977 PROTOCOLS TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS CLASSIFY </p><p>SOME INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS AS INTERNATIONAL AND THUS </p><p>COVERED BY THE CONVENTIONS.  THIS WAS LARGELY MOTIVATED BY </p><p>THE DESIRE OF THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES (ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT </p><p>HAD FOUGHT COLONIAL WARS) TO OBTAIN PRISONER-OF-WAR RIGHTS </p><p>FOR THOSE WHO WERE FIGHTING IN SO-CALLED WARS OF NATIONAL </p><p>LIBERATION.  THEY SOUGHT TO CLASSIFY SUCH CONFLICTS AS </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FOR PURPOSES OF THE LAWS OF WAR, IN LARGE </p><p>PART BECAUSE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE RIGID BUT </p><p>SENSIBLE STANDARDS OF THE 1949 GENEVA PRISONERS OF WAR </p><p>CONVENTION. </p><p> </p><p>-  PROTOCOL I\' AS IT FINALLY EMERGED, PROVIDES IN ARTICLE </p><p>1 THAT SUCH CONFLICTS SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL.  THIS WAS A MAJOR REASON FOR THE U.S. </p><p>REJECTION OF THE PROTOCOL.  TURKEY ALSO HAD MAJOR PROBLEMS </p><p>WITH ARTICLE 1 DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS OF THAT PROTOCOL. </p><p>NEITHER THE UNITED STATES NOR TURKEY IS A PARTY TO </p><p>PROTOCOL I. </p><p> </p><p>-  NONETHELESS, THE TERM "INSURGENCY" DOES NOT APPEAR IN </p><p>THE 1977 PROTOCOLS.  THE FACT THAT A GROUP IS </p><p>CHARACTERIZED AS AN INSURGENCY WOULD NOT AFFECT ITS </p><p>MEMBERS\' STATUS UNDER THE PROTOCOLS. </p><p> </p><p>-  THUS. UNDER THE CUSTOMARY LAWS OF WAR, THE 1949 GENEVA </p><p>CONVENTIONS AND THE 1977 PROTOCOLS\' USE OF THE TERM </p><p>"INSURGENCY" TO DESCRIBE THE PKK.S ACTIVITY DOES NOT IMPLY </p><p>OR CONVEY ANY RIGHTS OR BENEFITS ON THE PKK.  THEREFORE, </p><p>THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE UNITED STATES NOT TO USE THE </p><p>TERM SINCE, ACCORDING TO THE DICTIONARY, "INSURGENCY" </p><p>ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THE PKK\'S ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>END POINTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TARNOFF </p><p></p></div>
