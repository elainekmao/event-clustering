<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 LAGOS 000707 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD/IEA </p><p>TASHKENT FOR BURKHALTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EFIN, ECON, EINV, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: WAITING FOR A SIGN: NIGERIA OIL  EXECS </p><p>SAY THEY ARE NOT READY TO RETURN TO THE DELTA </p><p> </p><p>REFS:     A: Lagos 624 </p><p>          B: Lagos 568 </p><p>          C: Lagos 677 </p><p>          D: Lagos 575 </p><p>          E: Lagos 499 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  In the informal setting of a monthly </p><p>luncheon, oil company executives today talked about the </p><p>crisis in the Niger River delta (refs A and B), and </p><p>indicated the industry is in no hurry to return </p><p>evacuated employees to the swamps.  They consider the </p><p>loss of revenue from the closed facilities minimal in </p><p>comparison to the risk to staff safety and property </p><p>security that may yet occur if they restart operations. </p><p>They also note that Nigeria\'s refineries are mostly </p><p>closed, and the country now imports 100 percent of the </p><p>fuel it consumes, with no end in sight to the fuel </p><p>shortage.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>No Hurry to Get Back in the Swamps </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On April 3, ConGen attended the monthly Lagos </p><p>American Business Luncheon. The luncheon is a venue for </p><p>the managing directors of American businesses, mostly </p><p>from the oil sector, to meet informally and discuss </p><p>issues of mutual concern. Today\'s topic of discussion </p><p>naturally gravitated toward the situation in the Delta. </p><p>The oil executives present said that companies are </p><p>probably losing only five to six percent of an </p><p>estimated total loss of $25 million per day of </p><p>production income.  They arrive at this percentage by </p><p>deducting from total revenues the 60 percent share </p><p>taken by their joint venture partner, the Nigerian </p><p>National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), as well as taxes </p><p>and other fees and associated costs.  According to </p><p>these executives, the companies have little incentive - </p><p>- monetary or otherwise -- to resume production before </p><p>safety concerns are addressed.  None would speculate </p><p>whether production would resume before the election. </p><p>Chevron-Texaco and Shell Oil representatives have </p><p>previously stated that, before they return staff to </p><p>facilities in the Warri and Escravos area, the </p><p>companies will need specific assurances from the </p><p>government and local population that peace will be </p><p>maintained and that the oil firms\' workers will be safe </p><p>(ref C). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Nothing More to Give: Crude Capacity at Outer Limits </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The executives also said the GON has asked all </p><p>companies to produce as much crude as possible in May, </p><p>June and July.  However, the company executives report </p><p>that even when full production resumes, there is no </p><p>extra capacity in the system to produce much more than </p><p>the approximately 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) </p><p>that was pumped before the outbreak of violence in the </p><p>delta.  This confirms a conversation Econoff had with a </p><p>major oil producer representative on March 31, who said </p><p>the GON may publicly report that there is excess </p><p>capacity in crude oil production that may be tapped in </p><p>the future, but in reality, the companies have little </p><p>capacity beyond the production allocation levels </p><p>established for each of them.  The company </p><p>representatives stated that there is no cost-incentive </p><p>to build-out beyond the allocation level. Post </p><p>previously reported that Nigeria\'s crude oil output is </p><p>at maximum capacity (ref D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Not from Around Here: Nigeria Now Imports all its Fuel </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The executives reported that all of the </p><p>petroleum products currently consumed in Nigeria are </p><p>bought on the international market.  These imports are </p><p>arriving at a slower rate than the berths can handle. </p><p>It was reported that Mobil\'s tanks run dry every two to </p><p>three days waiting for shipments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) It was said that northern Nigeria\'s supply of </p><p>oil for refinery production and its supply of imported </p><p>fuel comes through Chevron\'s pipelines originating in </p><p>Escravos (ref C). Thus, surmised the executives, as </p><p>long as Chevron\'s production is shut down, long gas </p><p>queues throughout the country but particularly in the </p><p>north will continue.  The refineries in Warri and </p><p>Kaduna are completely down and technical problems are </p><p>preventing the refinery in Port Harcourt from upgrading </p><p>the product it has available. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Fuel lines were also the subject of discussion </p><p>at the Lagos Business School monthly breakfast on April </p><p>1.  John Pototsky, managing director of Mobil\'s </p><p>downstream operations, reported that Nigeria\'s fuel </p><p>shortage was due to fuel sellers failing to fulfill </p><p>their contracts (ref E).  However, Chief Rasheed </p><p>Gbadamosi, Chairman of the Petroleum Products Pricing </p><p>Regulatory Committee (PPPRC), blamed the fuel shortage </p><p>on a combination of factors namely, rejected cargo that </p><p>did not meet Nigerian specifications, the United </p><p>States\' purchase of available supplies when the price </p><p>first jumped, and consumer panic-buying.  Pototsky </p><p>echoed the fact that some consumer panic-buying is </p><p>occurring, as demand for finished petroleum products </p><p>rose from 21 million liters per day to 32 million over </p><p>the course of recent weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment: Pototsky also reiterated Post\'s </p><p>previous analyses, that unless fundamental change is </p><p>brought to the downstream sector, Nigeria will continue </p><p>to experience fuel shortages (ref C and E).  He </p><p>identified the necessary fixes as refinery repair and </p><p>maintenance, pipeline repairs, and market pricing for </p><p>gasoline sales.  These issues will remain acute in the </p><p>two weeks leading up to the nationwide elections.  If </p><p>oil does not flow from the Delta soon, Nigeria will </p><p>continue to lose much needed revenue as well as crude </p><p>for its under-capacity refineries.  Gasoline queues </p><p>will persist and perhaps increase; all of which will </p><p>raise the already high tension levels in many </p><p>communities throughout the country. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
