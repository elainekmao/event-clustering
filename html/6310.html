<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000334 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND INL </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>CDR PACOM FOR FPA </p><p>DEA FOR OF, OFF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: OPIUM CULTIVATION DOWN SHARPLY IN BURMA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: According to UNODC experts, Burma\'s notorious </p><p>Kokang Region is now free of opium.  So is northern Shan </p><p>State from Kutkai to Muse.  According to UNODC\'s opium </p><p>surveyors, preliminary indications from the data they have </p><p>collected throughout Shan State suggest that the area under </p><p>opium cultivation in Burma may be reduced by as much as 30 to </p><p>50 percent this year, despite excellent weather throughout </p><p>the opium growing territories.  Yields, however, will be </p><p>higher and it is still too soon to say whether the overall </p><p>crop will be higher or lower.  According to UNODC, former </p><p>poppy farmers from the opium-free areas are on the move </p><p>throughout Shan State, seeking work and food for their </p><p>families.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Jeremy Milsom, who is supervising UNODC\'s survey of </p><p>opium production in Burma, told poloff on March 11 that the </p><p>GOB\'s efforts to curtail opium production had had a major </p><p>impact in 2003.  According to Milsom the Kokang region and </p><p>all of northern Shan State from Kutkai to Muse was free of </p><p>opium.  UNODC teams had been through all of those areas and </p><p>had found no opium at all.  UNODC saw no evidence of opium in </p><p>Shan State Special Region No. 4 around Mong La, which had </p><p>declared itself opium-free in 1997.  Milsom said that UNODC </p><p>was still compiling its date for central, eastern, and </p><p>southern Shan State and that it was still hard to estimate </p><p>the overall reduction in opium acreage throughout Shan State. </p><p> Nevertheless, an initial survey of the data suggested that </p><p>the overall reduction could be in the range of 30 to 50 </p><p>percent of last year\'s 80,000 hectare crop. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On the downside, Milsom said that there was not much </p><p>reduction of opium acreage in the Wa territories, which were </p><p>now the only region in Burma where there was any latitude at </p><p>all for opium cultivation.  (The Wa are pledged to end opium </p><p>production in 2005.)  Even there, however, UNODC was able to </p><p>verify that townships around the Wa heartland of Mong Maw and </p><p>its capital of Pang Sang were free of opium.  Ironically, </p><p>Milsom noted, in the past, outside observers had always </p><p>attributed a majority of Burma\'s opium production to the Wa </p><p>territories, even though surveys had regularly shown </p><p>production in the Wa territories to be only 20 to 25 percent </p><p>of Burma\'s whole crop.  This year, however, with the </p><p>reduction in the other cease-fire areas and in government </p><p>controlled territories, the Wa could indeed end up producing </p><p>a majority of Burma\'s opium. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Milsom also noted that yields were definitely higher </p><p>this year, thanks to timely rains in November and December. </p><p>As a result, it was still too early to say whether the </p><p>overall opium crop in Burma would be higher or lower than </p><p>last year.  If the increase in yield offsets the decline in </p><p>acreage, it would be higher; otherwise it would be lower. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Finally, Milsom noted that the impact of the end of </p><p>opium production was being felt throughout northern Shan </p><p>State.  Former opium farmers were flocking into the Wa </p><p>territories seeking work to support their families. </p><p>Fortunately, the rice crop this year in the Wa territories </p><p>was excellent and there was work.  In future months and </p><p>years, however, the fate of these farmers and their families </p><p>will depend on what alternatives they find to opium </p><p>production. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Two points are worth making here.  First, if these </p><p>preliminary indications hold up, the Burmese may, in fact, </p><p>reduce acreage under cultivation even in a good weather year. </p><p> This year the weather has been excellent and prime growing </p><p>areas like the Kokang region, Kutkai, and Muse are all free </p><p>of opium, essentially as a result of firm GOB enforcement </p><p>actions.  Weather had little, if anything, to do with those </p><p>changes. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Secondly, the former opium poppy farmers now searching </p><p>for the means of livelihood in Shan State need the support of </p><p>the GOB and the international community.  The international </p><p>community can and should provide more assistance for </p><p>alternative development programs that will give these farmers </p><p>options.  End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
