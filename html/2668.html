<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000936 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W, AF/EPS, EB/OMA:ASNOW </p><p>LONDON FOR AFRICA WATCHER GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VICE PRESIDENT ABUBAKAR ON ECONOMIC ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  In a March 19 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Vice President Atiku Abubakar was non-committal on rapid </p><p>completion of the bilateral debt agreement, saying only that </p><p>he would discuss the issue with the Director-General of the </p><p>Debt Management Office.  The Vice President said Nigeria </p><p>remains committed to economic reform and will not run a </p><p>deficit this year.  He argued that the IMF and GON had not </p><p>separated, but were on a temporary hiatus until Nigeria </p><p>formulates an achievable macroeconomic program.  The Vice </p><p>President also endorsed USG long-term support for </p><p>agriculture, health and education.  EconOff (notetaker) was </p><p>also present.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Emphasizing the need to conclude quickly the </p><p>U.S.-Nigeria bilateral rescheduling agreement, Ambassador </p><p>Jeter explained the USG could not amend the bilateral </p><p>agreement as its terms are applied equally to all debtor </p><p>countries.  Despite the Embassy\'s good working relations with </p><p>the Debt Management Office (DMO), Director-General Arikawe </p><p>has been insistent on renegotiating the agreement. </p><p>Therefore, we have made very little headway on completing the </p><p>negotiation, the Ambassador stated.  The Vice President made </p><p>no comment, but agreed to discuss the issue with DMO\'s </p><p>Arikawe.  (Comment: We know Arikawe\'s stubbornness is the </p><p>result of a policy directive straight from the President to </p><p>negotiate better terms with every creditor.  If we know the </p><p>President has taken a keen interest, Abubakar knows it even </p><p>better.  Thus, his statement that he will talk to Arikawe is </p><p>a bit of a throw away.  It is Obasanjo, not Arikawe, who </p><p>needs to be convinced.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Vice President stated that the absence of a formal </p><p>IMF program would not cause the GON "to reverse or slowdown </p><p>on economic reforms."  Abubakar maintained that the IMF has </p><p>not "separated" from Nigeria, but will cooperate in </p><p>developing Nigeria\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and </p><p>supporting economic capacity-building.  After the GON </p><p>develops its own macroeconomic program, the Vice President </p><p>said, they would enlist the help of the IMF to monitor the </p><p>homegrown program.  Vice President Abubakar stated the </p><p>President would not severely limit government spending this </p><p>year because "too many Nigerians face social and economic </p><p>problems."  However, both he and the President were committed </p><p>"to spending within our income and avoiding large deficits." </p><p>When asked about the problem of state government spending, </p><p>the Vice President responded that the Fiscal Responsibility </p><p>Act, based on Brazil\'s model and now before the National </p><p>Assembly, will provide a foundation for limiting states\' </p><p>fiscal expenditures.  The Central Bank\'s directive limiting </p><p>commercial borrowing by state governments also has reduced </p><p>the problem of fiscal irresponsibility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Ambassador Jeter related the recent visit of USAID </p><p>Africa Assistant Administrator Constance Newman to Nigeria. </p><p>He explained that USAID is moving from a transitional </p><p>strategy for the first two years of democracy in Nigeria to a </p><p>long-term strategy focusing on fewer sectors, such as </p><p>agriculture, health and education.  Vice President Abubakar </p><p>welcomed this development, concurring that agriculture, in </p><p>particular, is a high Administration priority.  The Vice </p><p>President explained that agriculture has been the primary </p><p>focus of the National Economic Council of State Governors, </p><p>which he chairs.  State governments have primary </p><p>responsibility for agricultural development with the federal </p><p>government responsible for national policy and broad-based </p><p>programs that encompass more than one state, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Vice President went on to explain that the GON and </p><p>State Governors have subdivided the country into sectors to </p><p>promote mass production of specific agricultural goods for </p><p>export.  For example, Cross River State and the surrounding </p><p>area will target pineapple and palm products while northern </p><p>states will target gum arabic, groundnuts and tomato </p><p>products.  Areas in the Middle Belt will focus on citrus </p><p>fruits. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Ambassador Jeter encouraged the GON to focus on </p><p>industrial development, particularly in Kano, as a means of </p><p>providing employment in areas prone to social unrest.  He </p><p>emphasized the importance of increasing domestic investment </p><p>as a means of signaling to foreign investors that Nigerians </p><p>themselves are serious about economic development.  The Vice </p><p>President agreed, but lamented that high domestic interest </p><p>rates prohibit Nigerians from investing in infrastructure and </p><p>industry. To get around the high cost of borrowing, the GON </p><p>has persuaded commercial banks to earmark ten percent of </p><p>profits to support development of small- and medium-size </p><p>enterprises.  However, this program has not yet taken-off. </p><p>As a means of sourcing lower-cost funds, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>described the U.S. Export-Import Bank programs available to </p><p>Nigerian investors who want to use American goods and </p><p>services for their projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment.  The Vice President\'s response on the </p><p>bilateral debt agreement indicates that he may not be </p><p>actively involved in this issue.  This supports the DMO\'s </p><p>earlier assertion that each bilateral agreement must be </p><p>approved directly by President Obasanjo.  Also, Nigeria may </p><p>no longer feel the urgency of completing the bilateral </p><p>agreements now that the IMF has withdrawn from a formal </p><p>program.  Projected payments to the Paris Club, even under </p><p>the December 2000 Agreed Minute, will exceed the GON\'s 2002 </p><p>budget for total external debt servicing.  The GON will most </p><p>likely fall into arrears with the Paris Club notwithstanding </p><p>completed bilateral agreements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment Continued.  The Vice President\'s statement to </p><p>continue progress on economic reform and to spend within the </p><p>revenue stream this year is a prudent one; however, he could </p><p>not reasonable be expected to say anything that strayed too </p><p>far from fiscal orthodoxy.  However, other officials within </p><p>the GON and National Assembly have previously stated that </p><p>2002 spending may greatly exceed revenue; some observers, </p><p>including World Bank staff, predict the deficit may reach as </p><p>much as 20 percent of the eventual budget.  Any shortfall in </p><p>revenue from the sale of NITEL will certainly have a </p><p>significant impact on government spending this year; the </p><p>auction price of USD 1.3 billion is nearly one-fourth of the </p><p>GON\'s projected revenue for 2002.  Until the Executive and </p><p>National Assembly engage each other in the battle over the </p><p>2002 budget, it will be impossible to determine what course </p><p>of action will win out.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
