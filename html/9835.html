<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001555 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: CHEGUTU ZANU-PF CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO SUSPEND MDC </p><p>MAYOR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 1491 </p><p> </p><p>     B. HARARE 42 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On July 31 the ZANU-PF dominated city council of </p><p>Chegutu voted to suspend the MDC Mayor of Chegutu Francis </p><p>Dhlakama and withdraw all benefits of his office.  Dhlakama </p><p>facilitated an early July Ministry of Local Government audit </p><p>which detailed corruption perpetrated by various members of </p><p>the Chegutu City Council, primarily the ZANU-PF Deputy Mayor </p><p>Phineas Mariyapera.  Under normal circumstances a damning </p><p>government audit, such as this one should be enough to at </p><p>least investigate, if not suspend the city council -- rather </p><p>than the Mayor.  The audit puts the Ministry of Local </p><p>Government in a quandary, how to respect the results without </p><p>further tarring the image of ZANU-PF in Chegutu.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>Council Votes to Suspend Mayor </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 31 the ZANU-PF dominated city council of </p><p>Chegutu voted to suspend the MDC Mayor of Chegutu Francis </p><p>Dhlakama and withdraw all benefits of his office including </p><p>his official vehicle, house, salary, his secretary\'s salary, </p><p>his guards and his cell phone.  According to Dhlakama, only </p><p>the Minister of Local Government Ignatius Chombo has the </p><p>legal right to suspend him.  Dhlakama expects to receive </p><p>written notification of his suspension on August 1, and for a </p><p>representative of the council to demand his car keys.  He is </p><p>unsure when the other benefits might be withdrawn, but </p><p>believes that will follow soon.  Dhlakama will request a </p><p>meeting with Chombo on August 1 to argue his side of the </p><p>story, hoping to appeal the suspension; however, he expects </p><p>Chombo to uphold it. </p><p> </p><p>Audit Details Fraud by Councilors </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In early July, a team of Ministry of Local Government </p><p>auditors completed an investigation and report of corruption </p><p>perpetrated by various members of the Chegutu City Council, </p><p>primarily the ZANU-PF Deputy Mayor Phineas Mariyapera, and </p><p>councilor Chigaze for upwards of ZWD$150 million (about </p><p>USD$45,000 at the current parallel rate).  The scheme, </p><p>ongoing since 2001, involved understating taxpayer </p><p>payments--while the full sums were collected from the </p><p>taxpayer, some wound up in private accounts rather than </p><p>public coffers.  The government auditors recommended </p><p>immediate dissolution of the council and police investigation </p><p>of the fraud.  Dhlakama has facilitated the work of the </p><p>auditors and informs us that even ZANU-PF heavyweights are </p><p>annoyed at this crime--perhaps because it was local and they </p><p>did not benefit, perhaps because it has further alienated </p><p>ZANU-PF from the people of Chegutu. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Chegutu has been besieged with problems in the recent </p><p>past.  On July 21 ZANU-PF supporters prevented ten </p><p>prospective MDC candidates for the City Council from </p><p>registering their candidacies (Ref A).  Dhlakama himself was </p><p>reportedly beaten on that day.  In November 2002 about forty </p><p>ZANU-PF supporters attacked Dhlakama in his office injuring a </p><p>police officer, a bodyguard and damaging computers and </p><p>furniture (Ref B). </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The MDC will argue in Harare High Court on August 1 </p><p>that nomination courts in Chegutu, Rusape, Bindura and </p><p>Marondera should be re-opened to allow MDC candidates to </p><p>register for the August 30 - 31 urban council and mayoral </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Under normal circumstances a damning government audit, </p><p>such as the one completed in Chegutu by the same Ministry </p><p>that oversees local government, should be enough to at least </p><p>investigate, if not suspend the city council itself.  But on </p><p>planet Zimbabwe it appears that the MDC mayor will be </p><p>suspended instead, lawfully or not.  The audit does put the </p><p>Ministry of Local Government in a quandary, how to respect </p><p>the results of its own audit without further tarring the </p><p>image of ZANU-PF in Chegutu.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
