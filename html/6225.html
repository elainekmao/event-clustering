(C) The Turkish Parliament,s March 1 vote rejecting </p><p>deployment of U.S. troops, along with a worsening in </p><p>Turkish-Kurdish tensions, has shaken the GOT and has </p><p>increased the uncertainty surrounding Turkey,s ultimate </p><p>choices on Iraq.  Whether or not there will be a Northern </p><p>Option, your visit on humanitarian assistance planning </p><p>provides the USG with a good opportunity to craft a </p><p>cooperative approach to assistance and to maintain our </p><p>dialogue with Turkey.  Key issues for your discussions </p><p>include:  explaining our humanitarian strategy in Iraq as it </p><p>affects Turkey; encouraging cooperation with NGOs and </p><p>international organizations; establishing a framework for </p><p>coordination with the GOT and others in this area.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Aftermath of the March 1 Parliamentary Vote </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Parliament March 1 rejected the AK (Justice and </p><p>Development) Party Government\'s petition to permit deployment </p><p>of U.S. troops to Turkey.  A number of factors contributed to </p><p>the outcome, particularly: 1) strong anti-war sentiment in </p><p>the public, media, in Parliament on both sides of the aisle, </p><p>and other organs of the Turkish state; 2) the secular Turkish </p><p>State\'s fears about USG intentions in Iraq; 3) a desire by </p><p>the traditional State to undercut the Islamist-oriented AK; </p><p>and 4) AK\'s own internal political dynamics, rivalries, and </p><p>ineptitude.  The AK Government is now badly shaken.  AK </p><p>leader R. Tayyip Erdogan and P.M. Abdullah Gul were weakened, </p><p>and U.S.-Turkish relations have come under strain despite </p><p>affirmations on both sides.  Erdogan and Gul have hinted that </p><p>the defeated proposal could resurface in another form.  Many </p><p>observers believe it is not likely to emerge until after </p><p>Erdogan, who was elected to Parliament in a special March 9 </p><p>election, becomes the Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Turkish relations with the Kurdish entities in </p><p>northern Iraq have been particularly strained in recent days. </p><p> The population and leadership of northern Iraq is solidly </p><p>opposed to Turkish intervention on humanitarian or other </p><p>grounds.  On March 3, tens of thousands (some reports place </p><p>the figure at 300,000 or more) demonstrators in Irbil marched </p><p>in protest and several burned Turkish flags.  The Iraqi </p><p>opposition in its conference final statement February 28 </p><p>rejected the prospect of Turkish military intervention.  The </p><p>Iraqi Kurds have not given their agreement to have Turkish </p><p>camps set up in the areas the KDP and PUK control, to have </p><p>the Turkish Red Crescent operate there, nor to have </p><p>additional Turkish troops stationed there.  The Turks are </p><p>reacting harshly to these statements and to the </p><p>demonstrations.  In a recent media interview, U/S Grossman </p><p>cautioned against unilateral Turkish intervention in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOT Contingency Planning </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Turkey has done contingency planning for a </p><p>humanitarian crisis both on an internal, interagency basis </p><p>and with international organizations.  It has designated </p><p>airports (Gaziantep, Van and Erzurum) for humanitarian use. </p><p>MFA told us on March 6 that it may open the port of Mersin, </p><p>which is currently reserved for military use, to humanitarian </p><p>needs.  The GOT plans to establish 18 &humanitarian aid </p><p>collection zones8, to be run by the Turkish Red Crescent </p><p>(TRC), in northern Iraq and Turkey which could handle up to </p><p>276,000 refugees/displaced persons, but the GOT has said it </p><p>will try to serve populations in need on the Iraqi side of </p><p>their common border.  Turkey plans to repatriate displaced </p><p>persons as soon as the security situation would permit this. </p><p>Turkey has not attempted to coordinate its aid plan with the </p><p>Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) or the Patriotic Union of </p><p>Kurdistan (PUK), on whose territory the GOT intends to </p><p>provide relief.  As we understand, the Department has taken a </p><p>decision not to press Turkey to admit asylum seekers, and </p><p>Embassy recommends that we not/not press the Turks to do so </p><p>during your visit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) TRC has pre-positioned some resources, but there are </p><p>gaps (principally tents) in its ability to respond in the </p><p>event the full 276,000 persons need relief, in part because </p><p>TRC is not supposed to dedicate more than 60 percent of its </p><p>capacity to </p><p>any single crisis. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NGOs </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The GOT has been wary of NGOs, and few have been </p><p>able to officially register.  Since 1996, the Turkish-Iraqi </p><p>border has been closed to NGOs with very few exceptions.  MFA </p><p>told the Humanitarian Planning Team (HPT) that NGOs seeking </p><p>to provide assistance to displaced persons in Turkey or in </p><p>the border zone on Iraqi territory would have to register </p><p>with the GOT, sign an MOU defining the scope of their </p><p>activities, and coordinate with the TRC and/or UN agencies. </p><p>MFA told us the GOT would be more flexible with respect to </p><p>NGOs seeking to transit Turkey to deliver relief beyond the </p><p>border zone in Iraq.  The GOT is willing in principle to </p><p>approve applications on an ad hoc basis for NGOs focused on </p><p>humanitarian relief, rather than human rights or political </p><p>activism.  The International Rescue Committee has sent a </p><p>representative to Turkey to make application, and other NGOs </p><p>are expected to follow soon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Coordinating Assistance </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The GOT plans to establish crisis/coordination centers </p><p>in the Prime Ministry, MFA, Diyarbakir, Gaziantep and Van, </p><p>among others, in the event of a conflict in Iraq.  MFA has </p><p>also identified 42 diplomats to staff these centers. </p><p>However, the GOT has been reluctant to activate any of them </p><p>far in advance of a crisis.  In January, the HPT raised the </p><p>importance of coordination between civilian and military </p><p>planners in both our governments, as well as between them and </p><p>international organizations and NGOs, pointing to the </p><p>positive example of the Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) </p><p>in Kuwait.  Embassy has urged the Turks to act on this </p><p>recommendation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Meanwhile, EUCOM/Military Coordination Liaison Command </p><p>(MCLC) are developing plans for a Humanitarian Assistance </p><p>Coordination Center (HACC) or Humanitarian Operations Center </p><p>(HOC) in Diyarbakir.  However, some USG agencies have raised </p><p>concerns that this configuration may not be as open to </p><p>international humanitarian organizations and NGOs as other </p><p>possible structures.  MCLC Commanding General Peter Osman </p><p>will be in Ankara during your visit, providing an opportunity </p><p>to consult internally on this issue.  Maj. General Osman </p><p>would like to participate in your meetings with the GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) MFA has asked for a specific proposal, and has said it </p><p>would like to establish guidelines or even an MOU on the </p><p>coordination mechanism.  The GOT will expect to discuss this </p><p>further with you during your meetings on March 12. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Program and Recommendations </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Embassy is arranging the following appointments for </p><p>March 12:  mini-country team; an interagency meeting </p><p>including MFA, Prime Ministry, Turkish General Staff (TGS), </p><p>and Interior Ministry representatives, led by MFA </p><p>Undersecretary for Multilateral Political Affairs; lunch with </p><p>UN agencies; separate meeting with TGS; meeting with Turkish </p><p>Red Crescent President; reception hosted by the Ambassador. </p><p>As noted above, MCLC Commanding General Osman would like to </p><p>join the delegation for meetings with the GOT. </p><p>11. (C) Embassy recommends focusing on the following issues </p><p>during your meetings with GOT officials: </p><p>-- Overview of U.S. Strategy:  Emphasize our intention to </p><p>minimize displacement and damage to humanitarian </p><p>infrastructure in the event of a conflict, and that this will </p><p>in turn work in Turkey,s interest by keeping the number of </p><p>potential asylum seekers as low as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Role of International Organizations/NGOs:  Note that USG </p><p>assistance will be channeled mainly through UN agencies and </p><p>other humanitarian organizations.  Applaud Turkish </p><p>cooperation with UN agencies and positive signals on NGO </p><p>access to Iraq.  Encourage the GOT to give expeditious and </p><p>favorable consideration to NGO applications, to the World </p><p>Food Program,s registration in Turkey, and to the MOU </p><p>governing UN activities when presented by the UN.  Note that </p><p>we and other organizations will naturally seek to procure </p><p>relief supplies locally once it is clear that aid can transit </p><p>through Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Coordination:  Encourage the GOT to activate a crisis </p><p>center and establish a coordinating mechanism for </p><p>humanitarian assistance as soon as possible.  We should seek, </p><p>if at all possible, to present as much detail on our thinking </p><p>for this mechanism (HACC, HOC or other).  This will help </p><p>deflect the Turkish inclination to define it by means of an </p><p>MOU or other written guidelines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkish Role in Northern Iraq:  The GOT foresees a large </p><p>role for its Society in Northern Iraq, but the ICRC will have </p><p>the mandate for coordinating relief in conflict zones and the </p><p>KDP and PUK have their own contingency plans.  Urge the Turks </p><p>to coordinate humanitarian assistance. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
