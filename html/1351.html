(C) SUMMARY: ZANU-PF DEMAGOGUES ARE TURNING UP THE </p><p>HEAT ON ZIMBABWE\'S JUDICIARY IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE </p><p>THE ONLY GOVERNMENT INSTITUTION THAT STILL RETAINS SOME </p><p>INDEPENDENCE FROM THE RULING PARTY.  SO FAR, THE THREATS </p><p>ARE RHETORICAL IN NATURE, BUT THEY ARE BECOMING MORE </p><p>FREQUENT AND DIRECT.  ZIMBABWE\'S SUPREME COURT IS </p><p>CURRENTLY HEARING A CASE BROUGHT BY THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>FARM SEIZURES, WHICH HAS LED TO CALLS BY ZANU-PF FOR </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE GUBBAY\'S RESIGNATION.  OTHER JUDGES ARE </p><p>INCREASINGLY FEARFUL THAT GOVERNMENT HARASSMENT OR </p><p>THREATS AGAINST THEIR PERSON ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER. </p><p>UP UNTIL NOW, THE GOVERNMENT HAS IGNORED COURT RULINGS </p><p>THAT COULD DISRUPT THE RULING PARTY\'S PLANS TO STAY IN </p><p>POWER, AND MAY SEE LITTLE REASON TO AGGRESSIVELY </p><p>INTIMIDATE JUDGES, AS IT HAS OTHER OPPONENTS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE, INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TO CLING TO </p><p>POWER, IS MORE APT TO LASH OUT AT PERCEIVED ENEMIES, AND </p><p>ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY BEAR CLOSE WATCHING.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ON NOVEMBER 1, MINISTER OF STATE FOR INFORMATION </p><p>AND PUBLICITY JONATHAN MOYO CALLED FOR THE RESIGNATION </p><p>OF SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY GUBBAY.  GUBBAY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06388  01 OF 03  150527Z </p><p>IS HEARING THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' UNION\'S (CFU) LEGAL </p><p>CHALLENGE TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>FAST-TRACK LAND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  MOYO STATED THAT </p><p>IF GUBBAY DOES NOT RESIGN, HE SHOULD REMOVE HIMSELF FROM </p><p>THE CFU CASE AND OTHERS ON WHICH HE HAS ALREADY </p><p>COMMENTED PUBLICLY, CITING GUBBAY\'S 1991 COMMENTS ABOUT </p><p>THE UNFEASIBILITY OF LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE.  TO ADD </p><p>PRESSURE ON GUBBAY, TWO ZANU-PF PARLIAMENTARIANS, PHILIP </p><p>CHIYANGWA AND RICHARD MAJANGE, ARE DRAWING UP A MOTION, </p><p>WITH THE HELP OF A 12-MEMBER ZANU-PF LEGAL COMMITTEE, </p><p>THAT CALLS FOR PRESIDENT MUGABE TO SET UP A TRIBUNAL TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE GUBBAY\'S "ABUSE OF POWER."  THE DRAFT MOTION </p><p>DOES NOT LIST ANY SPECIFIC CHARGES, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>NOVEMBER 2 "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE."  THE MOTION WAS DUE </p><p>TO BE TABLED IN PARLIAMENT WHEN IT RECONVENES NOVEMBER </p><p>16 TO CONSIDER THE BUDGET, BUT A CHECK WITH PARLIAMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS REVEALED THAT THE MEASURE HAS YET TO BE LISTED </p><p>ON PARLIAMENT\'S AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN A CONVERSATION WITH DCM AND POLOFF ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 2, HIGH COURT JUSTICE YUNUS OMERJEE REPORTED </p><p>THAT HE IS INCREASINGLY FEARFUL THAT GOVERNMENT </p><p>HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER. </p><p>THE LATEST ROUND OF RHETORICAL ATTACKS AGAINST THE </p><p>JUDICIARY HAS REDUCED MORALE TO AN ALL-TIME LOW, </p><p>ACCORDING TO OMERJEE.  JUDGES ARE AFRAID TO BE SEEN WITH </p><p>AMERICANS AND OTHER WESTERNERS OUT OF FEAR OF COMING </p><p>UNDER GREATER SCRUTINY BY THE SECURITY SERVICES.  THEY </p><p>ARE TRYING TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE AT LEAST UNTIL THE </p><p>CURRENT COURT SESSION FINISHES AT THE END OF NOVEMBER. </p><p>OMERJEE STATED THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW OF ANY JUDGES WHO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06388  01 OF 03  150527Z </p><p>HAVE RECEIVED THREATS OR WHO HAVE BEEN HARASSED, BUT HE </p><p>BELIEVES THAT IT MAY NOT BE LONG BEFORE IT STARTS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE POLITICAL SCIENCE </p><p>PROFESSOR JOHN MAKUMBE CHARACTERIZED THE LATEST UPTURN </p><p>IN ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY AS MUGABE PLAYING THE "RACE </p><p>CARD."  MUGABE IS SO INFURIATED WITH WHITE ZIMBABWEANS, </p><p>HE IS GOING TO MAKE ALL THEIR LIVES MISERABLE, MAKUMBE </p><p>OPINED (MOST OF ZIMBABWE\'S HIGH COURT AND SUPREME COURT </p><p>JUSTICES ARE WHITE).  MAKUMBE BELIEVES THAT IF MUGABE </p><p>CANNOT FORCE JUDGES TO RESIGN OUTRIGHT, HE WILL </p><p>"PAUPERIZE" THEM ONCE THEY RETIRE.  HE CITED THE CASE OF </p><p>A JUDGE WHO RETIRED A FEW YEARS AGO AND HAD MADE </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL JUDGEMENTS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT VIRTUAL CUT OFF HIS PENSION AND STOPPED </p><p>PROVIDING THE PERKS HE WAS ENTITLED TO UNDER HIS </p><p>RETIREMENT CONTRACT.  THE JUDGE WAS FORCED TO SELL HIS </p><p>HOME AND FURNISHINGS AT AUCTION, AND NOW LIVES IN </p><p>POVERTY, ACCORDING TO MAKUMBE.  (COMMENT: MAKUMBE MAY </p><p>HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE ENOCH </p><p>DUMBUTSHENA, ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE NOW-DEFUNCT </p><p>FORUM PARTY.  END COMMENT.)  THREE JUDGES WILL BE COMING </p><p>UP FOR RETIREMENT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, MAKUMBE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9197 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06388  02 OF 03  150528Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------9F059E  150528Z /38 </p><p>P 150527Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7618 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 006388 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE RULING PARTY DEMAGOGUES ARE TURNING UP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06388  02 OF 03  150528Z </p><p>THE HEAT ON JUDICIARY </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) POLOFF MET HIGH COURT JUSTICE FERGUS BLACKIE </p><p>NOVEMBER 9 TO GET HIS ASSESSMENT OF THREATS AGAINST THE </p><p>JUDICIARY.  BLACKIE IS KNOWN RECENTLY FOR HIS DECISION </p><p>TO PROHIBIT ZANU-PF FROM SPENDING THE MDC\'S SHARE OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR POLITICAL PARTIES UNTIL A RULING </p><p>IS MADE.  (AT A NOVEMBER 14 HEARING, THE GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>DUE TO PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT THE MDC DID NOT SUBMIT THE </p><p>PROPER PAPERWORK FOR GOVERNMENT FUNDING BY THE JUNE </p><p>DEADLINE.)  BLACKIE SAID THAT NEITHER HE NOR ANY OF HIS </p><p>COLLEAGUES HAVE RECEIVED THREATS AGAINST THEIR PERSON-- </p><p>YET.  HE BELIEVES INSTEAD THAT THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZATION (CIO) IS CONDUCTING "RESEARCH" TO DIG UP </p><p>DIRT ON THE JUSTICES TO DISCREDIT THEM OR BLACKMAIL THEM </p><p>INTO RESIGNING.  IT WOULD BE EASIER THAN DISMISSING THEM </p><p>BECAUSE JUSTICES CAN BE DISMISSED ONLY AFTER A LONG, </p><p>CUMBERSOME PROCESS THAT REQUIRES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A </p><p>TRIBUNAL, BLACKIE STATED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) IT IS NO SECRET THAT GODFREY CHIDIYASIKU, THE </p><p>JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE HIGH COURT, IS A ZANU-PF </p><p>LOYALIST, AND HIS ADMINISTRATION OF THE COURT HAS BEEN </p><p>BIASED, BLACKIE CONTINUED.  (THE JUDGE PRESIDENT IS </p><p>CHARGED WITH ASSIGNING COURT CASES.)  THERE ARE AT LEAST </p><p>TWO OTHER HIGH COURT JUSTICES, OUT OF 15, WHO HAVE PRO- </p><p>GOVERNMENT LEANINGS, BLACKIE BELIEVES.  HIGH AND SUPREME </p><p>COURT JUSTICES ARE APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT TO TERMS </p><p>THAT EXTEND UNTIL RETIREMENT; JUSTICES MUST RETIRE AT </p><p>THE AGE OF 65 UNLESS THEY GET A MEDICAL PERMIT STATING </p><p>THAT THEY ARE MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY FIT, IN WHICH CASE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06388  02 OF 03  150528Z </p><p>THEY CAN SERVE UNTIL 70.  HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE SEES </p><p>THE JUDICIARY AS THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS AND A "SLIDE INTO DICTATORSHIP." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY GUBBAY </p><p>(STRICTLY PROTECT) TOLD POLOFF NOVEMBER 10 THAT HE </p><p>BELIEVES HE IS IN A MORE VULNERABLE POSITION THAN THE </p><p>OTHER JUSTICES.  THE PRESIDENT CAN SUSPEND THE CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE ON ANY GROUNDS, BUT HE CANNOT SUSPEND THE OTHER </p><p>SUPREME AND HIGH COURT JUSTICES--ONLY THE CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>CAN, AND ONLY FOR MALFEASANCE OR INCOMPETENCE, ACCORDING </p><p>TO GUBBAY.  THIS LEAVES GUBBAY PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE </p><p>TO THE WHIMS OF THE PRESIDENT, BUT HE DOES NOT THINK </p><p>THAT MUGABE WILL ACT AGAINST HIM IN THE NEAR FUTURE, </p><p>DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT RHETORIC CALLING FOR HIS </p><p>RESIGNATION.  (GUBBAY IS DUE TO RETIRE IN 2002.) </p><p>VISIBLY PERTURBED, THE CHIEF JUSTICE CHARACTERIZED </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO\'S STATEMENT ABOUT HIS 1991 REMARKS ON LAND </p><p>REFORM AS "COMPLETELY FALSE" AND SAID THAT THE JUSTICE\'S </p><p>FULL STATEMENT PRINTED IN "THE HERALD" UNWITTINGLY </p><p>PROVED THAT MOYO WAS LYING ABOUT THE CHIEF JUSTICE\'S </p><p>RECORD. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) GUBBAY WENT ON TO SAY HE WAS RELIEVED THAT </p><p>VOTERS REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT\'S PROPOSED CONSTITUTION </p><p>IN THE FEBRUARY REFERENDUM BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE REMOVED </p><p>THE SUPREME COURT\'S AUTHORITY TO HEAR CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>CASES.  IT WOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED A SPECIAL </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL COURT THAT MUGABE WOULD HAVE BEEN FREE TO </p><p>PACK WITH HIS SUPPORTERS.  THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION WOULD </p><p>ALSO HAVE INCREASED THE SUPREME COURT\'S NUMBERS FROM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06388  02 OF 03  150528Z </p><p>FIVE TO 11 AND GIVEN MUGABE THE ABILITY TO PACK THAT </p><p>COURT AS WELL.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT IGNORING </p><p>THE SUPREME COURT\'S ORDERS, GUBBAY EMPHASIZED THAT THE </p><p>GOZ HAS ONLY RECENTLY IGNORED RULINGS PERTAINING TO </p><p>LAND, AND HAS GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE COURT\'S ORDERS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT\'S RESPONSE TO THE SUPREME COURT\'S </p><p>NOVEMBER 10 RULING (REFTEL) THAT THE FARM OCCUPATIONS </p><p>ARE ILLEGAL AND MUST END HAS BEEN SURPRISINGLY </p><p>LACKLUSTER.  SOME MINISTERS, SUCH AS LANDS, AGRICULTURE </p><p>AND RESETTLEMENT MINISTER JOSEPH MADE WENT AS FAR TO </p><p>SUGGEST THE GOVERNMENT WOULD COMPLY WITH THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT\'S ORDER.  INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO, WHO </p><p>HAS MADE A HABIT OF ATTACKING THE JUDICIARY, PASSED UP </p><p>THE OPPORTUNITY THIS TIME AND INSTEAD PORTRAYED THE </p><p>RULING AS A REAFFIRMATION OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>BEEN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH ALL ALONG ON LAND REFORM.  THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT IS NOT OUT OF THE WOODS, YET, HOWEVER, AS </p><p>THE RECENT RULING WAS ONLY A RESPONSE TO AN URGENT </p><p>APPLICATION BY THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS\' UNION (CFU) ON </p><p>THE LEGALITY OF THE FARM OCCUPATIONS.  THE CHIEF JUSTICE </p><p>TOLD POLOFF THAT THE CFU\'S CHALLENGE ON THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S WHOLE RESETTLEMENT </p><p>SCHEME IS STILL BEFORE THE COURT.  GUBBAY SAID THAT THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9198 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06388  03 OF 03  150528Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-02 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------9F05A3  150528Z /38 </p><p>P 150527Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 7619 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 006388 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE RULING PARTY DEMAGOGUES ARE TURNING UP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06388  03 OF 03  150528Z </p><p>THE HEAT ON JUDICIARY </p><p> </p><p>CASE WILL LIKELY TAKE MONTHS TO RESOLVE, AND A RULING </p><p>WON\'T BE FORTHCOMING UNTIL JANUARY AT THE EARLIEST. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE WITHHOLDING JUDGMENT FOR THE </p><p>TIME-BEING ON THE COURT\'S RULING, THE JUDICIARY OPERATES </p><p>IN A MORE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT NOW THAN IT DID TWO MONTHS </p><p>AGO.  MANY JUSTICES ARE RELUCTANT TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC </p><p>WITH AMERICANS AND OTHER WESTERNERS OUT OF FEAR OF </p><p>COMING UNDER GREATER SCRUTINY FROM THE SECURITY </p><p>SERVICES.  ALL HAVE TOLD US THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S VERBAL </p><p>ATTACKS HAVE ADDED PRESSURE TO THEIR ALREADY STRESSFUL </p><p>JOBS, AND THEY FEAR THAT IT COULD STILL TURN INTO </p><p>OUTRIGHT INTIMIDATION.  UP UNTIL NOW, THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>IGNORED COURT RULINGS THAT WOULD DISRUPT ITS LAND REFORM </p><p>PROGRAM, AND IT MAY SEE LITTLE REASON TO AGGRESSIVELY </p><p>INTIMIDATE JUDGES, AS IT HAS OTHER OPPONENTS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE, WHO SEES HIMSELF AS UNDER SIEGE FROM </p><p>ALL SIDES, IS MORE LIKELY TO TURN THE FORCES OF VIOLENCE </p><p>ON HIS PERCEIVED ENEMIES THAN EVER BEFORE.  HE HAS YET </p><p>TO CROSS THAT LINE WITH THE JUDICIARY, BUT ANY ATTACKS </p><p>ON THE LAST BASTION OF OBJECTIVE GOVERNMENT IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>BEAR CLOSE WATCHING.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY MEET </p><p>WITH JUSTICES TO SHOW THEM SUPPORT AND CONCERN.
