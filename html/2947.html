(U)  SUMMARY:  RELIGIOUS REGULATION IN VIETNAM IS </p><p>CHARACTERIZED BY AN EVOLVING BUREAUCRATIC AND LEGALISTIC </p><p>APPROACH.  WHILE THE SRV CONSTITUTION PROTECTS RELIGIOUS </p><p>BELIEF (AND NON-BELIEF), THE GVN THOROUGHLY REGULATES </p><p>RELIGIOUS GROUPS AND RELIGIOUS PRACTICE UNDER THE PREMISE OF </p><p>MAINTAINING THE LEADING ROLE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF </p><p>VIETNAM (CPV).  THE CPV SETS GENERAL POLICY TOWARDS </p><p>RELIGION, WHILE A SUB-CABINET LEVEL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE ON </p><p>RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS (CRA) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING </p><p>NATIONAL POLICY.  LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE A PROMINENT AND </p><p>SOMETIMES INVASIVE ROLE IN MANAGING RELIGIOUS GROUPS AND </p><p>ACTIVITIES WITHIN THEIR BORDERS.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>REIGNING ON HIGH:  THE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  THE MOST RECENTLY PUBLICIZED CPV CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE DOCUMENT ON RELIGION -- DIRECTIVE 37/CT/TW OF JULY </p><p>2, 1998 -- ASSERTS THAT RELIGIOUS FOLLOWERS AND </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE </p><p>"GREAT NATIONAL UNITY" OR THE "GREAT UNIFIED PEOPLES BLOC." </p><p>ACCORDING TO A COMMENTARY ABOUT DIRECTIVE 37 ON THE CPV\'S </p><p>WEB SITE, THIS CAN BE "REASONABLY" VIEWED AS THE </p><p>"NATIONALIZATION" OF RELIGIONS.  THE CPV\'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>POLITICAL REPORT TO THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS IN APRIL 2001 </p><p>DESCRIBED FAITHS AND RELIGIONS AS "THE SPIRITUAL NEED OF A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01222  01 OF 05  151046Z </p><p>SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION."  IT ALSO NOTED THAT RELIGIOUS </p><p>FOLLOWERS ARE "OBLIGED TO FULFILL THEIR DUTIES AS CITIZENS </p><p>TOWARD THE HOMELAND . . . "  THE POLITICAL REPORT DID NOT </p><p>REPRESENT ANY CHANGE OF POLICY FROM DIRECTIVE 37;   BOTH </p><p>CALL FOR MORE COMPLETE LEGISLATION ON FAITHS AND RELIGIONS. </p><p>WHEN ASKED ABOUT REPORTS THAT THE CPV IS UPDATING ITS </p><p>RELIGION POLICY, CPV AND GVN OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN UNWILLING </p><p>TO COMMENT, WHILE NOT DENYING THAT A NEW POLICY MAY BE IN </p><p>THE WORKS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  THE CENTER FOR RELIGIOUS STUDIES OF </p><p>THE HO CHI MINH NATIONAL POLITICAL ACADEMY -- THE MAIN PARTY </p><p>SCHOOL -- OFFERS TRAINING TO MID- AND SENIOR-LEVEL CPV </p><p>MEMBERS, INCLUDING GVN OFFICIALS.  (ITS OFFICIALS HAVE, </p><p>HOWEVER, BEEN UNABLE TO MEET WITH EMBOFFS IN RECENT MONTHS, </p><p>CLAIMING BUSY TRAVEL SCHEDULES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.)  THE </p><p>CENTER ALSO UNDERTAKES RESEARCH AND "THEORETICAL WORK" ON </p><p>RELIGION.  ACCORDING TO LUU DAT TUYET OF THE ACADEMY\'S </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT, THE CENTER "CARRIES ON A </p><p>DIALOGUE" WITH THE GVN\'S CRA.  THE CENTER WAS ONLY </p><p>ESTABLISHED IN THE LATE 1990\'S AND APPARENTLY HAS NOT YET </p><p>TRAINED A LARGE NUMBER OF OFFICIALS, ESPECIALLY BELOW THE </p><p>NATIONAL LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  CPV OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT THERE IS NO EXPLICIT BAN </p><p>ON RELIGIOUS BELIEF AMONG CPV MEMBERS, AND OFFER ANECDOTAL </p><p>ACCOUNTS OF EVEN SENIOR CPV OFFICIALS VISITING TEMPLES AND </p><p>CHURCHES (ALTHOUGH NOT CLEARLY FOR RELIGIOUS VERSUS TOURIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES).  FEW, HOWEVER, SEEM TO PARTICIPATE OPENLY IN </p><p>RELIGIOUS LIFE OR ADMIT SUCH BELIEFS.  HOWEVER, SIX OF THE </p><p>26 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA) CANDIDATES IN THIS YEAR\'S ELECTION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01222  01 OF 05  151046Z </p><p>WHO DECLARED RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION ARE CPV MEMBERS (1 </p><p>CATHOLIC, 3 BUDDHISTS, AND 2 KHMER "BA NI").  SENIOR MONK </p><p>THICH THANH TU, ALSO VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE CENTRAL BUDDHIST </p><p>SANGHA AND HIMSELF A NON-CPV NA CANDIDATE, CLAIMED TO POLOFF </p><p>THAT "NO" BUDDHIST MONKS WERE PARTY MEMBERS BECAUSE </p><p>"MATERIAL CONCERNS" ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH BEING A MONK. </p><p>(NOTE:  NONETHELESS, VIETNAMESE BUDDHIST MONKS HAVE A LONG </p><p>HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICAL AFFAIRS.  END NOTE.) </p><p>THERE ARE UNVERIFIED REPORTS THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>OFFICIAL CAO DAI AND HOA HAO LEADERSHIP ARE ALSO CPV </p><p>MEMBERS.  THE CPV, THROUGH THE VIETNAM FATHERLAND FRONT </p><p>(VFF), ENSURES THAT A BROAD CROSS-SECTION OF SOCIETY, </p><p>INCLUDING RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS, IS REPRESENTED IN THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND THIS YEAR\'S CANDIDATES INCLUDE </p><p>BUDDHIST MONKS, CATHOLIC PRIESTS, AND PROTESTANT MINISTERS. </p><p> </p><p>MAKING RULES:  THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  ARTICLE 84, SECTION 5, OF THE REVISED 1992 </p><p>CONSTITUTION GIVES THE NA THE AUTHORITY TO DECIDE STATE </p><p>POLICIES ON ETHNIC COMMUNITIES AND RELIGIONS.  SINCE </p><p>RELIGION IS CONSIDERED A "SOCIAL PHENOMENON," SUCH </p><p>LEGISLATION FALLS UNDER THE NA COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL AFFAIRS, </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8329 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01222  02 OF 05  151047Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    ED-01    OIGO-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /017W </p><p>                  ------------------AEB82E  151047Z /38 </p><p>O 151042Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6461 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 05 HANOI 001222 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/RF </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS TO USCIRF </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR ABLAGG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01222  02 OF 05  151047Z </p><p> </p><p>WHICH IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE CRA TO DRAFT A NEW LAW </p><p>TO REPLACE GVN DECREE 26 OF AUGUST 19, 1999, PRESENTLY THE </p><p>PRIMARY LEGAL DOCUMENT ON RELIGION.  ACCORDING TO NGUYEN VAN </p><p>NGOC, CRA VICE CHAIRMAN, THE PRIME MINISTER APPROVED A DRAFT </p><p>OF THE LAW IN JULY 2001 AND SENT IT TO THE NA STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE.  THE NA WAS EXPECTED TO HAVE ENACTED THE LAW </p><p>DURING ITS TENTH SESSION, BUT APPARENTLY RAN OUT OF TIME </p><p>GIVEN THE DEBATE ON CONSTITUTIONAL REVISIONS, RATIFICATION </p><p>OF THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT, AND OTHER MORE PRESSING </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  THE NEW MEASURE MIGHT MORE EASILY BE ENACTED BY </p><p>THE NA STANDING COMMITTEE AS AN "ORDINANCE" IF IT APPEARS </p><p>UNLIKELY THAT THE NEW FULL NA (TO BE ELECTED MAY 19) WILL BE </p><p>ABLE TO PASS A MORE AUTHORITATIVE "STATE LAW" IN THE NEAR </p><p>FUTURE.  RELIGIOUS FIGURES, INCLUDING THICH THANH TU AND </p><p>PAUL JOSEPH CARDINAL PHAM DINH TUNG (ALSO ARCHBISHOP OF </p><p>HANOI), SEPARATELY HAVE ADMITTED TO POLOFFS THAT THEY WERE </p><p>GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON A DRAFT OF THE LAW IN </p><p>THE AUTUMN OF 2001.  NEITHER, HOWEVER, COULD PREDICT ITS </p><p>OUTCOME, OFFERED DETAILS ABOUT THEIR VIEWS, OR WERE WILLING </p><p>TO ASSESS WHAT, IF ANY IMPACT THEIR COMMENTS WOULD HAVE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO THE CRA\'S NGOC, THE LEGISLATION WILL </p><p>CORRECT SOME OF THE RECOGNIZED PROBLEMS WITH DECREE 26, </p><p>WHICH EVEN HE AND OTHERS DESCRIBED AS "INCOMPLETE."  THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01222  02 OF 05  151047Z </p><p>LEGISLATION WILL ALSO CLEARLY CONFIRM THE NA\'S OWN </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OVER RELIGIOUS POLICY, ACCORDING TO </p><p>COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL AFFAIRS VICE CHAIRMAN LE QUOC THANH. </p><p>THANH SAID THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH WHICH THE COMMITTEE </p><p>HAS BEEN WRESTLING IS HOW TO DEFINE "SUPERSTITION."  DECREE </p><p>26 OUTLAWS SUPERSTITIOUS PRACTICES WITHOUT PROVIDING </p><p>EXAMPLES.  (NOTE:  UNDER CPV DIRECTIVE 37, SUPERSTITION IS </p><p>TO BE "CRITICIZED AND ELIMINATED."  END NOTE)  NGOC INCLUDED </p><p>LACK OF DEFINITIONS AMONG DECREE 26\'S SHORTCOMINGS AND ALSO </p><p>LAMENTED THAT THE DECREE DID NOT ALLOW THE GVN TO INSPECT </p><p>THE FINANCES OF RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN ENOUGH DETAIL.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT, IN DRAFTING THE NEW LAW FOR SUBMISSION TO THE NA, THE </p><p>CRA HAD STUDIED THE LAWS ON RELIGION OF OVER 35 COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>FINAL SAY:  THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  THE PRIME MINISTER HAS ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OVER MANY </p><p>DECISIONS DEALING WITH RELIGION, ACCORDING TO VARIOUS </p><p>SOURCES.  ONLY THE PRIME MINISTER MAY DECIDE WHETHER TO </p><p>AUTHORIZE A RELIGIOUS GROUP, SUCH AS IN THE 2001 FORMAL </p><p>RECOGNITION OF THE SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM </p><p>(SECV).  COMPLAINTS ABOUT VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONALLY </p><p>PROTECTED FREEDOM "TO BELIEVE OR NOT TO BELIEVE" IN A </p><p>RELIGION MAY BE INVESTIGATED BY THE CRA AT THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER\'S DIRECTION, BUT ONLY THE PRIME MINISTER MAY TAKE </p><p>ACTION BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF SUCH AN INVESTIGATION, </p><p>ACCORDING TO CRA CHAIRMAN LE QUANG VINH.  DECREE 26 ALSO </p><p>RESERVES A NUMBER OF OTHER POWERS FOR THE PM, INCLUDING: </p><p>-- APPROVAL OF APPOINTMENTS TO THE OFFICES OF MOST VENERABLE </p><p>(FOR BUDDHIST LEADERS), CARDINAL, BISHOP, AND CURATE AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01222  02 OF 05  151047Z </p><p>EQUIVALENTS; </p><p>-- APPROVAL OF RELIGIOUS CONFERENCES AND CONVENTIONS </p><p>INVOLVING MORE THAN ONE PROVINCE; </p><p>-- APPROVAL OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CLERGY TRAINING </p><p>INSTITUTIONS; AND, </p><p>-- WHETHER TO ALLOW RELIGIOUS GROUPS TO RECEIVE "PURELY </p><p>RELIGIOUS AID" FROM OVERSEAS. </p><p> </p><p>OVERSIGHT: THE COMMITTEE ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  WITH A REORGANIZATION OF RELIGIOUS OVERSIGHT BY THE </p><p>GVN AND VFF IN THE EARLY 1990\'S, THE GOVERNMENT CRA WAS SET </p><p>UP IN 1993 AND REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE PRIME MINISTER.  IT </p><p>HAS SUB-CABINET-LEVEL RANK AND IS THE LINE AGENCY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING RELIGIOUS POLICY.  IT ALSO </p><p>ADVISES THE GVN ON RELIGIOUS POLICY.  ACCORDING TO NGUYEN </p><p>THE DOANH, DIRECTOR OF THE CRA INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS </p><p>DEPARTMENT, THE CRA HAS BETWEEN 120 AND 150 EMPLOYEES IN </p><p>HANOI.  (THERE ARE CRA-EQUIVALENTS ALSO ON THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>AND DISTRICT LEVELS WORKING ON THE STAFFS OF THOSE LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, NOT DIRECTLY FOR THE CRA.  SEE PARAS 14-15) </p><p>THERE ARE SEVERAL ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS, INCLUDING AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS DIVISION RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL CONTACT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8330 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01222  03 OF 05  151047Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    ED-01    OIGO-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   MOFM-05  MOF-01   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /017W </p><p>                  ------------------AEB834  151047Z /38 </p><p>O 151042Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6462 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 05 HANOI 001222 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/RF </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS TO USCIRF </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR ABLAGG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01222  03 OF 05  151047Z </p><p> </p><p>WITH FOREIGNERS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  FIVE DIVISIONS SPECIALIZE IN THE MAJOR </p><p>RECOGNIZED RELIGIONS -- BUDDHIST, CATHOLIC, PROTESTANT, CAO </p><p>DAI, AND HOA HAO (THE LATTER APPARENTLY ALSO COVERS SMALLER </p><p>GROUPS SUCH AS ISLAM, POSSIBLY THE BAHA\'I, AND POTENTIALLY </p><p>ANY OTHER FAITHS WITH FEW FOLLOWERS IN VIETNAM).  NOT ONLY </p><p>DO THESE FIVE DIVISIONS ADMINISTER LAWS ON RELIGION, THEY </p><p>ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR UNDERTAKING NEGOTIATIONS WITH STILL </p><p>UNOFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED RELIGIOUS GROUPS.  MOST NOTABLY, </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDERWAY FOR RECOGNITION OF SOME </p><p>"UNDERGROUND" PROTESTANT GROUPS, SUCH AS THE BAPTISTS. </p><p>THERE IS NO KNOWN DIALOGUE, HOWEVER, WITH THE UNITED </p><p>BUDDHIST CHURCH OF VIETNAM, OR WITH CAO DAI OR HOA HAO </p><p>GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE REJECTED PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>THEIR RELIGIONS\' RESPECTIVE OFFICIAL BODIES.  THE CRA ALSO </p><p>MUST ENSURE THAT ANY RELIGIOUS GROUPS APPLYING FOR </p><p>RECOGNITION COMPLY WITH ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF DECREE </p><p>26.  ONCE THE CRA IS SATISFIED (AS WAS THE CASE IN 2001 WITH </p><p>THE SECV), IT RECOMMENDS A FORMAL DECISION IN FAVOR BY THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  IN APRIL 1999, THE CRA SET UP A PUBLISHING HOUSE </p><p>UNDER ITS AEGIS TO CENTRALIZE ALL RELIGIOUS PUBLISHING IN </p><p>VIETNAM.  BEFORE THAT DATE, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PUBLISH </p><p>RELIGIOUS MATERIALS AT OTHER LEGAL PUBLISHING HOUSES, WHICH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01222  03 OF 05  151047Z </p><p>ARE NOW FORMALLY BANNED FROM SUCH RELIGIOUS PUBLISHING.  THE </p><p>CRA\'S NGOC SAID THAT THE CRA\'S PUBLISHING HOUSE BENEFITS </p><p>RELIGIOUS GROUPS BECAUSE IT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DIFFICULT TO </p><p>GET "PROFIT-ORIENTED" PUBLISHERS TO PRINT RELIGIOUS </p><p>DOCUMENTS.  SOME RELIGIOUS FIGURES HAVE NOTED THAT IT IS NOT </p><p>NOW PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN BASIC RELIGIOUS TEXTS </p><p>SUCH AT THE BIBLE OR THE KORAN THROUGH THE RELIGIOUS </p><p>PUBLISHING HOUSE, ALTHOUGH SOME PROTESTANTS IN HANOI </p><p>COMPLAINED PRIVATELY IN 2001 ABOUT ONGOING SHORTAGES OF BOTH </p><p>BIBLES AND HYMNALS.   THERE ARE REPORTS ABOUT A PRINTING OF </p><p>NEW TESTAMENTS, APPARENTLY AIMED PRIMARILY AT THE RECENTLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED SECV CHURCHES.  MOSQUE OFFICIALS IN HANOI NOTED </p><p>THAT THE PUBLISHING HOUSE HAD ESSENTIALLY PRINTED A KORAN </p><p>FOR EACH KNOWN MUSLIM IN THE COUNTRY IN 2000 AND HAD NO </p><p>ONGOING PUBLISHING OF MUSLIM MATERIALS.  (NOTE:  IT IS </p><p>ILLEGAL TO BRING IN "REACTIONARY" MATERIALS -- SOMETIMES </p><p>DEFINED BY CUSTOMS OFFICIALS TO INCLUDE BIBLES AND OTHER </p><p>RELIGIOUS MATERIALS -- INTO THE COUNTRY FROM OVERSEAS. END </p><p>NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  VICE CHAIRMAN NGOC ADDED THAT THE CRA MEDIATES </p><p>SPECIAL PROBLEMS FACED BY RELIGIOUS GROUPS.  NGOC CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THE CRA HAD ARRANGED A MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY SETTLEMENT </p><p>BETWEEN A CARMELITE MONASTERY AND A COMPANY SEEKING TO BUILD </p><p>A WATER PARK ON LAND WHERE THE MONASTERY HAD CULTIVATED </p><p>ORCHARDS FOR MANY YEARS.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE CRA ALSO </p><p>ASSISTED RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN THEIR BUREAUCRATIC DEALINGS </p><p>WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, FOR INSTANCE OVER BUILDING </p><p>PERMITS.  NGOC AND OTHER OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THAT LOCAL GVN </p><p>OFFICIALS, ESPECIALLY IN REMOTE PROVINCES, ARE SOMETIMES NOT </p><p>FAMILIAR WITH LAWS ON RELIGION AND "MAKE MISTAKES"; THE CRA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01222  03 OF 05  151047Z </p><p>HELPS THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE PROVISIONS OF DECREE 26, HE </p><p>NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  THE CRA ALSO SUPERVISES CLERGY TRAINING </p><p>INSTITUTIONS (SEPTEL) IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>EDUCATION AND TRAINING AS WELL AS PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES. </p><p>RELIGIOUS FIGURES HAVE STATED TO EMBOFFS THAT AT LEAST THE </p><p>THREE MAIN BUDDHIST ACADEMIES AND SIX CATHOLIC SEMINARIES DO </p><p>CONTROL THEIR OWN BUDGETS AND THAT FUNDING TO CARRY OUT </p><p>TRAINING ACTIVITIES COMES FROM THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS </p><p>THEMSELVES.  THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING NEITHER </p><p>SUPPORTS CLERGY TRAINING INSTITUTIONS FINANCIALLY, NOR SEEKS </p><p>TO CONTROL THEIR BUDGETS, ACCORDING TO THESE SOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>DAY-TO-DAY REGULATION: LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.
