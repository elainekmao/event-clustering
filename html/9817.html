(C)  SUMMARY  On July 28 Ambassador met with Minister of </p><p>Agriculture Gianni Alemanno over US concerns with the GOI\'s </p><p>policy prohibiting minute amounts of biotech material in </p><p>conventional seed lots.  Ambassador Sembler prefaced the July </p><p>28 conversation by stating that he brought up the seizure of </p><p>corn field days earlier with the Italian PM.  Alemanno did </p><p>not register any reaction to this news or to the Ambassador\'s </p><p> editorial published in Il Sole 24 Ore on July 12, 2003. </p><p>Ambassador Sembler delivered a clear message that friction </p><p>caused by current Italian anti-biotech policies, and the </p><p>northern Italian corn crop seizures, are apt to inflame </p><p>anti-European trade irritations and provoke negative </p><p>reactions from the US Congress.  The US losses in seed sales </p><p>to Italy over the past four years are precipitous.   The GOI </p><p>anti-biotech policy has had a seriously detrimental effect on </p><p>the US - Italian seed trade and on its bilateral trade </p><p>relationship.  Alemanno did not take responsibility for the </p><p>troubles, yet expressed his regrets. The Minister said that a </p><p>new EU Seed Directive, expected this fall, will prevent </p><p>future incidents. He refused to answer what will happen in </p><p>Italy if Brussels does not come up with an agreement.  Next </p><p>season, he predicted, there will be biotech, conventional, </p><p>and organic seeds planted in Italy.  We are skeptical, and as </p><p>Milan 523 reports, seizures of crops continue.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)   Ambassador, EST Couns, and AgAtt met July 28, with </p><p>GOI MinAg Gianni Alemanno , and his staff  responsible for </p><p>trade and biotech policy regarding food, feed, and seed. </p><p>Accompanying Alemanno were the MinAg\'s science advisor, </p><p>director of food quality, and diplomatic advisor, all in a </p><p>listening mode. The Minister spoke with very little </p><p>consultation with his advisors. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Ambassador conveyed US discouragement and dismay that </p><p>the Agriculture Ministry\'s policy of zero tolerance for </p><p>adventitious presence (AP) in conventional seeds continue to </p><p>cause problems. The latest incident has escalated in Piemonte </p><p>with crop destruction, in Lombardy, Emilia Romagna, and </p><p>Friuli-Venezia-Giulia  with crop seizures,  (Reftels  Milan </p><p>465, Milan 488, 512 and 523). </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Responding to the Ambassador\'s point that no health </p><p>or environmental reason justified destruction of the growing </p><p>corn,  MinAg said that the Piemonte regional government  was </p><p>legally correct to pursue its solution to the discovery of </p><p>AP in the corn crop. Referring to Lombardy, he offered that a </p><p>solution was still under consideration, including the </p><p>possibility of turning the sequestered, harvested corn into </p><p>"stocks that could be used after the AP issue is decided at </p><p>the EU level." Note: given that the corn was harvested before </p><p>tasseling, it is likely to be immature and high in moisture, </p><p>making this an unlikely alternative.  Alemanno dodged </p><p>responsibility for the crop seizures by stating that he </p><p>inherited but did not create the zero tolerance policy, and </p><p>that he did not wish to become the first Italian Minister to </p><p>revoke it.  Minister Alemanno  made the zero tolerance more </p><p>explicit and its enforcement more stringent in its </p><p>interpretation over the past two growing seasons.  He </p><p>authorized two annual regulations directing seed policy,  the </p><p>2001 Seed Circular and the 2002 version, which interpret the </p><p>zero tolerance policy for AP in conventional seeds for </p><p>planting.  The former restated a zero tolerance for AP in </p><p>seeds for planting, and the 2002 version eliminated ambiguity </p><p>by defining zero tolerance to the quantity of  99.99 percent </p><p>purity for seed lots.  A tolerance of 0.01 percent for </p><p>biotech is difficult to achieve in seeds imported from any </p><p>country where biotech crops are produced.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Ambassador Sembler questioned MinAg on what the GOI </p><p>would do during the Italian Presidency of the EU to address </p><p>AP tolerances in seeds for planting.  He also asked, what </p><p>the GOI would do in the absence of an agreement by the EU on </p><p>seed tolerances.  MINAG sought cover behind the prospect that </p><p>the EC Scientific Seed Committee will establish tolerances, </p><p>now that the work on labeling and traceability is completed. </p><p>However, Alemanno cautioned, since labeling was established </p><p>at 0.9 percent (down from the original proposal of 1 </p><p>percent), he expected the thresholds for three types of seed, </p><p>according to the original proposals, to also be reduced in </p><p>order for the crop in the field to be at a lower AP than </p><p>imported food and feed grains. Emboffs questioned the </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>scientific justification for this math. Alemanno said that </p><p>the acceptable level for AP in corn seed might be </p><p>"proportionally" lowered from 0.3 to 0.2; for soybean seed , </p><p>from 0.5 to 0.4 and for rapeseed from 0.7 to 0.6 in imported </p><p>conventional seeds.  Organic seed, he continued, would be </p><p>held to zero biotech content, and biotech seed, 100 percent. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  When questioned further, Alemanno replied that this </p><p>proposal was hypothetical in nature.   When asked whether </p><p>this formula might be political rather than scientific, </p><p>Alemanno acknowledged that thresholds could become political </p><p>if enough member states oppose the EC proposal.  For Italy\'s </p><p>part, however, he stated that the GOI wants to adjust to EU </p><p>decisions.  And what about the agricultural organizations of </p><p>Italy? The GOI wants to work with them in a confidential way, </p><p>to work out their conflicts. He agreed that Coldiretti, </p><p>Italy\'s largest farmer organization, is "anti GM, for zero </p><p>tolerance." </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Alemanno acknowledged that adhering to a zero </p><p>tolerance is very difficult with seeds coming "from anywhere </p><p>in the world."  With regard to labeling of seeds there will </p><p>be a threshold, as yet undefined, not to restrict imports but </p><p>for labeling, as is the case for foods. Alemanno opined that </p><p>this should be the last time that his government has to face </p><p>questions on AP in conventional corn seeds. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Ambassador Sembler was assured by Alemanno that by </p><p>next planting season, Italian farmers will have three choices </p><p>in types of cultivation: organic, conventional, and biotech. </p><p>He emphasized that Italian farmers and Italian consumers will </p><p>be able to make choices. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Alemanno also raised coexistence.  The next problem, </p><p>he opined, is to prevent mixing between zones of cultivation, </p><p>or "contamination" of organic and conventional cultivation </p><p>from contiguous areas growing GM crops "under small parcel </p><p>cultivation." He was aware of the EU Agricultural </p><p>Commissioner\'s interpretation that entire areas would not be </p><p>allowed to declare themselves GM-Free. When asked how a </p><p>farmer would get "permission" or have the assurance that he </p><p>will be allowed to grow a biotech crop, no details were </p><p>offered.  He said that the protocols would be clear and would </p><p>allow the farmer freedom of choice, but not the freedom to </p><p>interfere with another\'s freedom of choice. </p><p>When pressed on the question of what policy the GOI would </p><p>pursue until such an agreement is reached, Alemanno refused </p><p>to reply saying only, "We hope to get an agreement." </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Alemannos\'s solution to the problem of regulating </p><p>agricultural biotechnology is to label.  In the case of a </p><p>seed directive, he would prefer to not have the current </p><p>dilemma over allowable AP but to have AP labeled and let the </p><p>farmers choose their type of seed.  He pointed to the current </p><p>labeling for food and feed as giving consumers a choice. He </p><p>did not comment on how the member states will reach a </p><p>consensus on the seed directive, but admitted that it will </p><p>likely be protested against by consumers and farmers alike in </p><p>Italy.  He said (we agree) that Italian farmers\' groups are </p><p>split, and,  according to polls, most Italian consumers are </p><p>against agricultural biotech.  A political choice will have </p><p>to be made, and Alemanno concluded that Italy will best reach </p><p>toward a scientific justification from the commissioner, </p><p>hopefully to be put forward by Commissioner Byrne in </p><p>September or October. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  Ambassador Sembler made the case for "someone to </p><p>take leadership" to find a solution to get out of the current </p><p>troubles with corn seed and agricultural biotechnology in </p><p>general.  He advised Minister Alemanno that the U.S. Congress </p><p>is if anything more frustrated with the biotech deadlock. </p><p>AMB. Sembler also stated that "our farmers can\'t wait idly </p><p>for another two or three years8 before they have a chance to </p><p>gain back what they have lost in the Italian seed market. </p><p>Alemanno went back to the question of the corn seizures and </p><p>said that the acreage involved was a small fraction of total </p><p>corn acreage in Italy.  While he was mathematically correct </p><p>in his assertion, Ambassador Sembler insisted that the impact </p><p>of the corn seizures was very negative and it made a </p><p>disproportionately anti-GMO mark in the media. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C)  Alemanno stated that labeling is the "compromise" </p><p>which will allow freedom of choice, both for consumers and </p><p>ultimately, once there is a seed law, for farmers. </p><p>Ambassador Sembler answered  that market forces will work, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>but only if zero tolerance for AP is not the policy governing </p><p>trade in seeds. His request to Alemanno was to create biotech </p><p>policies that will let the market work. </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY COMMENTS </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)   For more than two years we\'ve pressed the GOI to </p><p>establish a reasonable AP for conventional corn and soybean </p><p>seeds, to lift the Amato Decree, and to allow farmers and </p><p>consumers choices.  While leaving himself plenty of </p><p>flexibility, Alemanno did discuss specific actions that will </p><p>be taken, particularly with regard to AP for seeds. This </p><p>makes this discussion a high-water mark for our exchanges </p><p>with him.  This was also the first time we\'ve heard him say </p><p>that biotech crops could be grown in Italy next year with </p><p>Ministry approval, a statement that could portend a lifting </p><p>of the Amato decree.  The seizure of  northern corn fields </p><p>and the destruction of crops may  mark a turning point for </p><p>Alemanno as he becomes more pragmatic and EU-oriented towards </p><p>biotechnology. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  We also found Alemanno more relaxed, more conversant </p><p>with technical aspects of seed and feed thresholds , and more </p><p>confident about EU procedures and the various regulatory </p><p>frameworks and laws coming into force over the next several </p><p>months.  He had tables of test results for samples of corn in </p><p>Piemonte, and at one point drew for Ambassador a schematic </p><p>diagram of organic, conventional, and agriculture GM in an </p><p>explanation of the EU co-existence policy.  Alemanno came </p><p>very close to saying we should have no further problems with </p><p>the input of U.S. feeds into Italy. We also believe he will </p><p>move toward EU approved thresholds for AP in conventional </p><p>seeds when the EC scientific committee makes its proposal </p><p>next fall.  We are more skeptical of his intention to allow </p><p>Italian farmers to plant EU-approved GM corn varieties (which </p><p>would of course, mean repealing the Amato decree) in the next </p><p>planting season.  We believe it more likely that the Ministry </p><p>will devise complicated procedures for permissions to plant </p><p>GM seed, using the co-existence guidelines.  Those Italian </p><p>farmers who would consider planting GM seed may find </p><p>themselves in a bureaucratic strait-jacket. </p><p>Sembler </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03481 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
