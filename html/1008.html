<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L JAKARTA 004282 </p><p> </p><p>ROME FOR THE VATICAN </p><p> </p><p>HANOI ALSO FOR A/S ROTH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/06/09 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINT, MOPS, UN, PO, ID </p><p>SUBJECT: XANANA GUSMAO TO BE RELEASED SEPTEMBER 7 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMB. J. STAPLETON ROY; REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY. THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT PLANS TO RELEASE XANANA </p><p>GUSMAO ON TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7. ALTHOUGH THE INDONESIAN PLAN IS </p><p>TO RETURN HIM TO EAST TIMOR ON THAT DAY, THE BRITISH (AND WE) </p><p>CONSIDER THAT COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND ARE SEEKING TO ARRANGE </p><p>HIS RELEASE IN JAKARTA, WHERE HE WILL BE HOUSED WITH THE BRITISH </p><p>AMBASSADOR. WHAT WILL BE POSSIBLE WILL BE DETERMINED IN MEETINGS </p><p>LATER ON SEPTEMBER 6. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON THE AFTERNOON OF SEPTEMBER 6, I MET WITH THE UK </p><p>AMBASSADOR, THE PORTUGUESE REPRESENTATIVE, AND A MEMBER OF </p><p>XANANA GUSMAO\'S STAFF TO DISCUSS ARRANGEMENTS FOR XANANA </p><p>GUSMAO\'S RELEASE. THE DISCUSSION REVEALED THE FOLLOWING. JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER MULADI TELEPHONED XANANA GUSMAO LATE SEPTEMBER 5 AND </p><p>INFORMED HIM THAT HIS RELEASE ORDER WOULD BE SIGNED ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 6, AND HE WOULD BE SENT BY PLANE TO EAST TIMOR ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 7 TO BE TURNED OVER TO UNAMET. XANANA TURNED DOWN </p><p>THESE ARRANGEMENTS, NOTING THAT HIS PURPOSE IN GOING TO EAST </p><p>TIMOR WOULD BE TO MEET WITH HIS PEOPLE, WHICH WOULD BE </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. WE ALL AGREED IT WOULD </p><p>BE INCONCEIVABLE TO SEND XANANA TO EAST TIMOR UNDER CURRENT </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES THERE, AND IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HEAD THIS OFF. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE UK AMBASSADOR HAD AGREED TO OFFER HOSPITALITY TO </p><p>XANANA AT HIS RESIDENCE, WHERE HE WOULD BE MORE SECURE. IT WAS </p><p>NOT KNOWN YET WHETHER THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD AGREE TO </p><p>XANANA\'S RELEASE IN JAKARTA. XANANA AND HIS LAWYER WERE </p><p>SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH MULADI IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER 6, WHERE IT WAS HOPED THIS COULD BE CLARIFIED. (I </p><p>LATER LEARNED THAT UNAMET JAKARTA REPRESENTATIVE TAMRAT SAMUEL </p><p>JOINED THIS MEETING). UK MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>JOHN BATTLE IS ARRIVING IN JAKARTA THIS EVENING (SEPT 6) AND THE </p><p>UK AMBASSADOR PLANNED TO TAKE HIM IMMEDIATELY TO CALL ON XANANA </p><p>AT 10 P.M. THE BRITISH HOPED TO GET PERMISSION FOR XANANA TO BE </p><p>RELEASED THE SAME EVENING SO HE COULD SPEND THE NIGHT AT THE </p><p>BRITISH RESIDENCE (BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT HIS SECURITY AT HIS </p><p>PRESENT LOCATION). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IF IT TRANSPIRED THAT THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT </p><p>AGREE TO XANANA\'S RELEASE IN JAKARTA (WHETHER TONIGHT OR </p><p>TOMORROW), THE UK AMBASSADOR (OR BATTLE) WOULD TELEPHONE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER ALATAS AND INDICATE THAT THE BRITISH WOULD IMMEDIATELY </p><p>MAKE PUBLIC THE FACT OF THEIR OFFER. FOREIGN SECRETARY ROBIN </p><p>COOK HAD APPROVED THIS GAME PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AMBASSADOR JAMSHEED MARKER SUBSEQUENTLY INDICATED THAT IF </p><p>IT APPEARED THAT THE INDONESIANS WERE INSISTENT ON RETURNING </p><p>XANANA TO EAST TIMOR, HE WOULD IMMEDIATELY ASK THE UN SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL TO TELEPHONE HABIBIE TO TRY TO PREVENT THIS. HE </p><p>AUTHORIZED THE UK AMBASSADOR TO INFORM ALATAS OF THIS IF </p><p>NECESSARY. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) AMBASSADOR MARKER INDICATED THAT PRESIDENT HABIBIE HAD </p><p>INFORMED HIM OF HIS PLAN TO RELEASE XANANA AND TURN HIM OVER TO </p><p>UNAMET IN BAUCAU ON SEPTEMBER 7 OR 8. MARKER TOLD THE PRESIDENT </p><p>THAT UNAMET WAS NOT WILLING TO PLAY THIS ROLE SINCE IT COULD </p><p>HARDLY INSURE XANANA\'S SECURITY WHEN IT COULD NOT ASSURE ITS OWN </p><p>SECURITY UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES. HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT </p><p>WHEN XANANA WAS RELEASED, HE SHOULD BE FREE TO GO WHERE HE </p><p>CHOSE. THE PRESIDENT HAD INDICATED THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT </p><p>COULD BE DISCUSSED (THIS LED TO TAMRAT SAMUEL\'S PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>THE MEETING WITH MULADI). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROY </p><p></p></div>
