<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 002456 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOIST STUDENT UNION SUSPENDS STRIKE </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 2346 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On December 22 the Maoist-affiliated All Nepal </p><p>National Independent Students Union - Revolutionary </p><p>(ANNISU-R) ended its strike against private schools in the </p><p>Kathmandu Valley after the schools\' directors agreed to cut </p><p>tuition up to 25 percent.  The strike, which began on </p><p>December 9, had forced the closure of 2,000 private and </p><p>boarding schools across the Valley for two weeks, affecting </p><p>500,000 students.  Lincoln International School, which is </p><p>attended by most Mission dependent children, continued to </p><p>hold classes at alternate locations, including private homes, </p><p>from December 9-19, when the winter break began.  Other </p><p>private schools in Kathmandu not already on winter break </p><p>opened December 23 for the first time in two weeks. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  The ANNISU-R announcement cautioned that the </p><p>student union will reinstitute the strike the second week of </p><p>February if the rest of its demands are not met.   Rajesh </p><p>Khadka, President of the Private and Boarding School </p><p>Organization of Nepal (PABSON), told the Embassy that his </p><p>organization had done its part to avert continuation of the </p><p>strike by lowering tuition, suspending the assessment of </p><p>miscellaneous additional fees, and pledging to hire more </p><p>Nepali teachers.  The rest of the demands made by ANNISU-R, </p><p>including that the Government of Nepal (GON) lift its </p><p>official designation of the student wing as a terrorist </p><p>organization, is up to the GON, he observed.  Therefore no </p><p>one should blame PABSON if the strike resumes in February, he </p><p>declared.  Other demands include that the GON disclose the </p><p>whereabouts of student leaders in detention, and provide free </p><p>education up to secondary school. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Nepal\'s public education system is so bad that </p><p>even very poor Nepalis try to enroll their children in </p><p>private school.  The GON has not yet officially responded to </p><p>the ANNISU-R\'s suspension of its strike, but recent comments </p><p>from GON leaders make it appear unlikely that they will agree </p><p>to lift the terrorist designation given the student group. </p><p>The student union probably came under considerable pressure </p><p>from members of "civil society"--including, quite possibly, </p><p>some with links to the Maoists--for holding the educational </p><p>system hostage to their demands.  The reduction in school </p><p>fees allows the ANNISU-R to claim a moral victory that may </p><p>resonate with the many low-income Nepalis struggling to keep </p><p>their children in private school.  To counter this, the GON </p><p>will have to make good-faith efforts--and make them fast--to </p><p>improve the public school system. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
