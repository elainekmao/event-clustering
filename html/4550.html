<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIRUT 003741 </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA/ARN AND S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, PGOV, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  LEBANON: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 201772 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECURITY CONDITIONS IN LEBANON WORSENED DURING 2002 WITH </p><p>THE KILLING OF AN AMERICAN MISSIONARY, EXPLOSIONS AT SEVERAL </p><p>AMERICAN FRANCHISE RESTAURANTS, AND A SPIKE OF CROSS-BORDER </p><p>ATTACKS INTO ISRAEL IN MARCH-APRIL.  LEBANON, LIKE MANY </p><p>COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, IS EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE IN </p><p>TERRORIST EVENTS BY SUNNI EXTREMIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON (GOL) REMAINS UNABLE TO EXERT </p><p>CONTROL IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING PORTIONS </p><p>OF THE BIQ\'A VALLEY, SOUTH LEBANON, THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS OF </p><p>BEIRUT, AND THE PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS.  EASY ACCESS TO </p><p>ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES CONTINUES TO BE CONDUCIVE TO THE </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM.  SYRIAN AND IRANIAN SUPPORT </p><p>FOR HIZBALLAH "RESISTANCE" ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH, AS WELL </p><p>AS ASSISTANCE TO HIZBALLAH AND PALESTINIAN GROUPS IN </p><p>LEBANON, HELP PERMIT TERRORIST ELEMENTS TO FLOURISH. </p><p>SEVERAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN </p><p>LEBANON, INCLUDING HIZBALLAH, PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD </p><p>(PIJ), THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE - </p><p>GENERAL COMMAND (PFLP-GC), HAMAS, THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION </p><p>(ANO), ASBAT AL-ANSAR, AND SEVERAL SMALL LOCAL SUNNI </p><p>EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DESPITE ITS LIMITED ABILITY TO COUNTER HIZBALLAH AND </p><p>PALESTINIAN REJECTIONIST GROUPS, THE GOL HAS A FREER HAND IN </p><p>DEALING WITH SUNNI EXTREMISM.  THE GOL HAS COOPERATED WITH </p><p>THE U.S. IN COMBATING AL-QAIDA AND AFFILIATED LOCAL SUNNI </p><p>EXTREMIST GROUPS SUCH AS ASBAT AL-ANSAR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST-RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT TOOK PLACE </p><p>IN LEBANON IN 2002 INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>-- ON MARCH 12, INFILTRATORS FROM LEBANON KILLED SIX </p><p>ISRAELIS IN SHELOMI, A TOWN IN NORTHERN ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>-- DURING THE PERIOD MARCH-APRIL, HIZBALLAH AND PALESTINIAN </p><p>REJECTIONIST GROUPS PERPETRATED SEVERAL CROSS-BORDER ATTACKS </p><p>INTO ISRAEL, INCLUDING THE FIRING OF KATYUSHA ROCKETS. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON APRIL 25, THERE WAS AN ABORTED ATTEMPT TO SET OFF AN </p><p>EXPLOSION AT A PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT IN SHUWEIFAT (BEIRUT). </p><p> </p><p>-- ON MAY 9, AN EXPLOSION DAMAGED A KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN </p><p>RESTAURANT IN TRIPOLI. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON JULY 11, A SUNNI EXTREMIST KILLED THREE LEBANESE ARMED </p><p>FORCES (LAF) PERSONNEL IN SIDON AND FLED INTO THE NEARBY AIN </p><p>EL-HILWEH PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP.  VARIOUS PALESTINIAN AND </p><p>ISLAMIC GROUPS SUBSEQUENTLY FACILITATED THE HANDOVER OF THE </p><p>SUSPECT TO THE GOL. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON SEPTEMBER 23, AN EXPLOSION IN A PARKING LOT ADJACENT </p><p>TO THE MCDONALD\'S IN JUNIEH, NEAR BEIRUT, DAMAGED SEVERAL </p><p>VEHICLES. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON NOVEMBER 12, EXPLOSIONS DAMAGED PIZZA HUT RESTAURANTS </p><p>IN TRIPOLI AND JUNIEH, AND A LOCAL FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT IN </p><p>JUNIEH. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON NOVEMBER 21, AN AMERICAN MISSIONARY WAS SHOT AND </p><p>KILLED IN SIDON. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ANSWERS THAT FOLLOW ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS IN REFTEL: </p><p> </p><p>A) THE GOL INFORMED THE EMBASSY THAT IT ARRESTED IN OCTOBER </p><p>THREE SUSPECTED AL-QAIDA OPERATIVES.  THE INDIVIDUALS WERE </p><p>ALLEGEDLY ATTEMPTING TO START AN AL-QAIDA TERRORIST CELL IN </p><p>LEBANON.  THE GOL ALSO OFFERED COOPERATION WITH THE USG ON </p><p>THE INVESTIGATION CONCERNING SEPTEMBER 11 HIJACKER ZIAD </p><p>JARRAH (A LEBANESE NATIONAL). </p><p> </p><p>FROM JANUARY 1 THROUGH MID-NOVEMBER, THE SPECIAL </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS COMMISSION INVESTIGATED 113 CASES INVOLVING </p><p>ALLEGATIONS OF MONEY LAUNDERING, 20 OF WHICH WERE RELATED TO </p><p>TERRORIST FINANCING.  NO ACCOUNTS RELATED TO THE FINANCING </p><p>OF TERRORISM WERE DISCOVERED IN LEBANESE BANKS AND FINANCIAL </p><p>INSTITUTIONS IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOL AMENDED ITS LAW ON MONEY LAUNDERING AND ITS PENAL </p><p>CODE THIS YEAR TO STRENGTHEN PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO COMBAT </p><p>THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM.  THE AMENDMENT TO THE PENAL CODE </p><p>PROVIDES FOR THREE TO SEVEN YEARS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE </p><p>FOR ANY PERSON THAT CONTRIBUTES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO </p><p>THE FINANCING OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>B) THE JUDICIARY IN OCTOBER INDICTED THREE MEN (TWO LEBANESE </p><p>AND ONE SAUDI) AND 18 OTHERS IN ABSENTIA SUSPECTED OF AL- </p><p>QAIDA CONNECTIONS, INCLUDING PLANNING TO TRAIN PERSONNEL TO </p><p>CARRY OUT TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THEY WERE ALSO CHARGED WITH </p><p>FORGING DOCUMENTS AND PASSPORTS.  THE INDICTMENT CHARGED </p><p>THEM ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 335 OF THE PENAL CODE, WHICH </p><p>STIPULATES A SENTENCE OF NOT LESS THAN 15 YEARS </p><p>IMPRISONMENT.  THE CASE WAS REFERRED TO THE MILITARY </p><p>TRIBUNAL.  THE TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO START IN DECEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING A SPATE OF ATTACKS ON AMERICAN FRANCHISE </p><p>RESTAURANTS, THE GOL DISPATCHED LAF AND INTERNAL SECURITY </p><p>FORCE (ISF) PERSONNEL TO PROTECT THESE FACILITIES ON A 24- </p><p>HOUR BASIS.  THE GOL IS COOPERATING CLOSELY WITH U.S. </p><p>OFFICIALS AND PROVIDING INFORMATION ON ITS INVESTIGATION OF </p><p>THE MURDER OF A U.S. CITIZEN IN SIDON. </p><p> </p><p>C) THE GOL DID NOT EXTRADITE ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR </p><p>PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR.  THE U.S. DID NOT REQUEST ANY </p><p>NEW EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISM SUSPECTS OF THE GOL IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>D) THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTING AND/OR </p><p>EXTRADITING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN LEBANON.  LEBANESE LAWS </p><p>PROHIBIT THE EXTRADITION OF ANY LEBANESE NATIONAL TO A THIRD </p><p>COUNTRY.  THE LEBANESE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS INDEPENDENT IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE, BUT SUBJECT TO POLITICAL PRESSURE (FROM </p><p>INFLUENTIAL LEBANESE POLITICIANS, AS WELL AS SYRIAN LEADERS </p><p>AND INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL) IN PRACTICE.  THE GOL </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGES THE UN LIST OF TERRORIST GROUPS DESIGNATED </p><p>PURSUANT TO UNSCR 1267/1390.  HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE TERRORIST GROUPS DESIGNATED SOLELY BY THE USG </p><p>AND WILL NOT TAKE ACTION AGAINST THESE GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>TO DATE, A COURT HEARING IN THE APPEAL MADE BY THE </p><p>PROSECUTOR\'S OFFICE REGARDING THE ASSASSINATION OF U.S. </p><p>AMBASSADOR FRANCIS MELOY AND TWO OTHERS IN 1976 HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>SCHEDULED, FOLLOWING A COURT VERDICT DECLARING THE SUSPECT, </p><p>TAWFIZ MUHAMMAD FARROUKH, NOT GUILTY OF MURDER FOR HIS ROLE </p><p>IN THE KILLINGS. </p><p> </p><p>E) SENIOR GOL OFFICIALS HAVE REPEATEDLY DENOUNCED AND </p><p>CONDEMNED THE SEPTEMBER 11 AND OTHER TERRORIST ATTACKS. </p><p>PRIME MINISTER HARIRI ISSUED A STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE </p><p>MURDER OF AN AMERICAN MISSIONARY IN SIDON. </p><p> </p><p>LEBANESE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE </p><p>PAST ACTS OF TERRORISM.  ALTHOUGH NO ARRESTS HAVE YET BEEN </p><p>MADE REGARDING RECENT BOMBINGS AGAINST AMERICAN FAST-FOOD </p><p>RESTAURANTS AND THE MURDER OF AN AMERICAN IN SIDON, LEBANESE </p><p>LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE PLEDGED THEIR SUPPORT IN </p><p>FINDING THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTS. </p><p> </p><p>F) NONE. </p><p> </p><p>G) THE GOL PROVIDES NO KNOWN MATERIAL OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT </p><p>TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  AT SYRIA\'S DIRECTION, HOWEVER, </p><p>IT DOES PROVIDE SAFEHAVENS AND BASES FOR SEVERAL TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS.  SYRIA HAS GRANTED HIZBALLAH AND PALESTINIAN </p><p>REJECTIONIST GROUPS, INCLUDING PIJ, PFLP-GC, AND HAMAS THE </p><p>RIGHT TO MAINTAIN BASES AND OFFICES IN VARIOUS AREAS OF </p><p>LEBANON, INCLUDING THE BIQ\'A VALLEY, THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS OF </p><p>BEIRUT, AND PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS.  THE GOL IS POWERLESS </p><p>TO TAKE UNILATERAL STEPS TO REMOVE THESE SAFEHAVENS FROM </p><p>LEBANESE TERRITORY. </p><p> </p><p>H) THE GOL HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p>HOWEVER, GOL OFFICIALS HAVE CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN, PUBLICLY </p><p>AS WELL AS PRIVATELY, THAT HIZBALLAH IS A "RESISTANCE," NOT </p><p>A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>I) THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 2001 IN THE </p><p>GOL\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM. </p><p>THE GOL IN 2002 DEMONSTRATED GREATER EFFORTS TO PURSUE </p><p>FUGITIVE SUNNI EXTREMISTS, INCLUDING SUSPECTS IN HIDING IN </p><p>PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS.  THE GOL HAS NOT ENTERED THE </p><p>CAMPS TO PURSUE SUSPECTS, BUT SUCCESSFULLY PRESSURED </p><p>PALESTINIAN AND ISLAMIC GROUPS TO HAND OVER A SUSPECT WANTED </p><p>FOR KILLING THREE LAF PERSONNEL.  THE LAF ALSO UNDERTOOK AN </p><p>OPERATION TO CONFISCATE WEAPONS FROM AN ANO WEAPONS </p><p>WAREHOUSE ADJACENT TO THE AL-JILAL PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP </p><p>NEAR BAALBEK. </p><p> </p><p>J) THE GOL HAS ACCEPTED AND IMPLEMENTED ALL LISTS PASSED BY </p><p>THE U.S. UNDER E.O. 13224 AND UNSCRS 1267, 1333 AND 1373, </p><p>EXCEPT FOR THE REQUEST TO FREEZE HIZBALLAH ASSETS.  IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST, THE SIC ASKED FOR EVIDENCE OR </p><p>SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAT WOULD WARRANT AN INVESTIGATION </p><p>UNDER LEBANESE LAW. </p><p> </p><p>K) (I) THE U.S. HAS REPEATEDLY ASKED THE GOL TO TURN OVER </p><p>THE LEBANESE TERRORISTS INVOLVED IN THE 1985 HIJACKING OF </p><p>TWA 847 AND IN THE ABDUCTION, TORTURE, AND MURDER OF </p><p>AMERICAN HOSTAGES FROM 1984 TO 1991.  U.S. COURTS HAVE </p><p>BROUGHT INDICTMENTS AGAINST A NUMBER OF THESE HIZBALLAH </p><p>OPERATIVES, SOME OF WHOM REMAIN IN PROMINENT POSITIONS IN </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION TODAY.  THE GOL ARGUES THAT ITS PROVISION </p><p>OF AMNESTY TO LEBANESE INVOLVED IN ACTS OF VIOLENCE DURING </p><p>LEBANON\'S CIVIL WAR PREVENTS IT FROM PROSECUTING THESE </p><p>CASES.  WITH REGARD TO THE THREE TWA 847 SUSPECTS, INCLUDING </p><p>IMAD MUGHNIYA, THE GOL MAINTAINS THAT THEY ARE NOT IN </p><p>LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>(II) THE LAF PROVIDES IMMEDIATE PERIMETER PROTECTION OF THE </p><p>U.S. EMBASSY AND ACCOMPANIES EMBASSY PATROLS OF THE </p><p>SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE ISF PROVIDES PROTECTIVE EOD </p><p>AND INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE EMBASSY.  THE LAF AND ISF </p><p>HAVE RESPONDED FULLY TO OUR REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>L)  NOT APPLICABLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BATTLE </p><p></p></div>
