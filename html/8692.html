Furthermore, Khalilzad offered the Turkmen </p><p>a role in the new Iraqi administration in exchange for </p><p>written recognition of Iraqi Kurdistan.  Ankara had first </p><p>agreed to recognize Kurdistan within the framework of the </p><p>new Iraqi constitution, but had to step back in the face of </p><p>the Turkmen reaction, according to Turkish diplomatic </p><p>sources.  A U.S. diplomat in Iraq, David Pearce, has told </p><p>the Turkmen that the U.S. regards the Iraqi Turkomen Front </p><p>as an extension of Turkey, according to "Cumhuriyet."  `The </p><p>U.S. has not forgotten, and will not forgive the reluctance </p><p>displayed by Turkey during the war with Iraq,\' Pearce said. </p><p>Bomb attack on U.S. Consulate Adana: On Wednesday, a Turkish </p><p>man tossed two grenades into the garden of the U.S. </p><p>Consulate in Adana. One grenade detonated in the garden, but </p><p>there were no injuries.  The attacker, who was apprehended </p><p>immediately after the incident, said his action was meant as </p><p>a retaliation against recent Israeli attacks on Muslims in </p><p>Palestine. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ankara holds `secret\' meetings with Armenians: Following the </p><p>meeting between the Turkish and Armenian foreign ministers </p><p>in Madrid last month, the MFA contacted Armenian </p><p>representatives in the U.S. to explore the possibility of </p><p>some goodwill gestures, papers report.  MFA officials in </p><p>Yerevan gave the message that Ankara would open the border </p><p>with Armenia immediately if the Armenians were to remove all </p><p>territorial claims from their constitution and drop all </p><p>references to a genocide by Turks.  The diplomats also urged </p><p>Yerevan to exert influence on the Armenian diaspora to help </p><p>block efforts to gain U.S. Congressional recognition of an </p><p>Armenian genocide.  Other MFA diplomats told Armenians in </p><p>the U.S. that provocative moves by the diaspora could </p><p>undermine mutual good will. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Greek note of protest to Turkey: Athens presented a note of </p><p>protest to Turkey after increases in alleged harassment by </p><p>Turkish military jets over the Aegean negatively influenced </p><p>Turkish and Greek tourism.  Greek Foreign Minister </p><p>Papandreou complained to EU\'s Verheugen the other day about </p><p>the increased harassment of Turkish military jets.  A </p><p>Turkish diplomat is quoted as saying that Ankara should </p><p>block Greek efforts to secure EU support for the Greek </p><p>position to avoid further confusion in Turkey\'s troubled </p><p>relationship with the EU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Greeks admit past support for PKK: In an Athens court case </p><p>exploring the illegal entry of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to </p><p>Greece in 1998, some Greek officials have admitted that the </p><p>PKK had been regarded as a second army on Greece\'s side in </p><p>the Turkish-Greek conflict.  Former Public Order Minister </p><p>Papatemelis reportedly said that Athens had supported the </p><p>Kurds\' cause of dividing Turkey, adding that the Kurdish </p><p>state to be founded in Iraq would have triggered the </p><p>disintegration of Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Middle East </p><p>b) US-Turkey relations in post war Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Middle East Vision" </p><p>Ahmet Tasgetiren argued in the Islamic-intellectual Yeni </p><p>Safak (6/12): "US policy in the Middle East is the </p><p>imposition of the US vision on others.  That is the main </p><p>reason for the current tension between Turkey and the US. </p><p>Washington has been sending advice to Ankara urging Turkey </p><p>to change its `vision.\'  First Wolfowitz, and more recently </p><p>Perle were giving the same advice: Turkey needs a new vision </p><p>on the Middle East issue, and  a `diversion\' of views would </p><p>be a disaster.\'  By referring to a `diversion,\' the US </p><p>officials are implying that Turkey must look at the Middle </p><p>East in the same way as the US.  . This is an early </p><p>indication of the US obsession to redesign the Middle East. </p><p>. The US should realize that only Turkey can provide the </p><p>right advice to the US on the region.  Turkey should never </p><p>stop suggesting to Washington that it look at the region </p><p>from a different angle, free from any subjective assessments </p><p>and aspirations of imperial hegemony." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey\'s condition to withdraw from northern Iraq" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in the mass appeal-sensational Posta </p><p>(6/12): "Iraq will be the most sensitive subject to be dealt </p><p>with in Turkish-American relations in the days ahead. </p><p>Turkey has not yet formulated a definite policy on Iraq. </p><p>Some bitterness and a certain degree of disappointment is </p><p>being experienced.  Turkey has felt a certain degree of </p><p>uneasiness due to the uncertain American position regarding </p><p>the presence of some 3,000 PKK militants in northern Iraq. </p><p>The future of these militants who live in camps set up along </p><p>the Iran and Iraq border has yet to be determined.  . The US </p><p>wants Turkey to withdraw its troops, and Turkey will not </p><p>budge until the PKK threat is entirely eliminated.  . There </p><p>is another issue that the US considers `most important\' as </p><p>part of its medium and long-term expectations from Turkey: </p><p>How exactly will Turkey view northern Iraq -- that is, the </p><p>Kurds -- and Iraq in general?  The US wonders how Ankara </p><p>will arrange its relations both with its own Kurds and the </p><p>northern Iraqi Kurds.  . Ankara is expected to provide the </p><p>answers to such questions.  Ankara, meanwhile, is expecting </p><p>Washington to clarify its approach toward the PKK." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
