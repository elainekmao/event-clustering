<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002421 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/21/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ASEC, PTER, XA </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA SECURITY AND STABILITY ASSESSMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) ABUJA 2347 </p><p>     B. (B) SECSTATE 162454 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Tim Andrews for reasons 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: The likelihood of ethnic or religious unrest </p><p>in Nigeria in the wake of an eventual U.S. response to the </p><p>September 11 acts of terror is high.  Such unrest would not </p><p>necessarily be targeted at American individuals or </p><p>institutions, but American lives and property could be at </p><p>risk.  Tensions here remain elevated following recent events </p><p>in Jos (Ref. A) and Wukari.  Demonstrations--either in favor </p><p>of or opposing U.S. military actions--could spark renewed </p><p>ethno-religious fighting, especially in the Middle Belt, but </p><p>potentially almost anywhere.  Major Muslim religious leaders </p><p>here have unequivocally condemned the attacks on the U.S. </p><p>However, many Muslims will be angered over any U.S. reprisal </p><p>attack that affects fellow Muslims, especially if there are </p><p>significant civilian casualties. Some Muslims can be expected </p><p>to stage protests, as they did during the Gulf War and </p><p>following our reprisals for the Embassy bombings in 1998. </p><p>The GON is willing to protect U.S. diplomats and </p><p>installations in Abuja and Lagos, but its ability to do so is </p><p>not unlimited.  Outside of Abuja and the Lagos Islands, the </p><p>GON\'s means of controlling civil unrest are even less robust. </p><p> Recently, the GON has managed to quell serious unrest in Jos </p><p>only with the assistance of the military, and then after a </p><p>substantial loss of life.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Nigeria, independent of events in the U.S., has just </p><p>suffered another paroxysm of ethno-religious conflict, this </p><p>time in normally peaceful Jos (Ref. A).  There is always a </p><p>potential for violent unrest in Nigeria in those places where </p><p>there exist longstanding ethnic or religious disputes.  In </p><p>the past two years, Kaduna, Abia, Lagos, Nassarawa, Bauchi, </p><p>Taraba and now Plateau States have witnessed civil unrest of </p><p>varying degrees that has resulted in a substantial number of </p><p>deaths and sometimes provoked reprisals elsewhere.  Many </p><p>Nigerians and expatriates believe that recent violence in Jos </p><p>was exacerbated by the terror attacks in the U.S.  Whether </p><p>that assessment is accurate or not is almost immaterial; the </p><p>fact that it is so widely believed creates a potential </p><p>danger.  Protests over U.S. reprisal attacks could spark a </p><p>new round of fighting, there or elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The most likely venues for large-scale protests in </p><p>the North would be Kano, Gusau, in Zamfara State and Kaduna </p><p>and Zaria in Kaduna State.  Protests could also materialize </p><p>in other places, including Jos, Suleja or Abuja.  With </p><p>political jockeying toward the 2002 and 2003 electoral cycles </p><p>underway, members of one party could accuse supporters of </p><p>another of having organized an anti-American protest in order </p><p>to discredit the second party.  There have already been </p><p>several apparently fictitious reports in Nigerian and </p><p>international media (septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  We believe GON security forces would be able to </p><p>contain any demonstration within the parts of Abuja </p><p>frequented by official Americans.  The potential for civil </p><p>unrest in response to a U.S. reprisal is highest in Kano </p><p>because it is the largest predominantly Muslim city in the </p><p>country, and is home to local and transnational Muslim </p><p>radicals who may try to incite crowds to protest a USG </p><p>military action.  After fuel-price demonstrations 15 months </p><p>ago left several dead, the Kano State Government, in </p><p>conjunction with the Emir of Kano, the National Police Force </p><p>and the SSS, has worked successfully to prevent large-scale </p><p>demonstrations and their associated violence.  It is unclear, </p><p>however, that they would be able to prevent, or to control, a </p><p>spontaneous demonstration in the Old City of Kano in response </p><p>to U.S. retaliation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The Old City could easily produce a spontaneous </p><p>protest numbering in the tens of thousands.  USAID/ OTI is </p><p>closing its office in Kano and turning over the lease and </p><p>equipment to the African Development Foundation in </p><p>conjunction with OTI closeout in Nigeria.  The USAID/OTI Kano </p><p>office was the target of peaceful protests by some Muslims </p><p>after a Johns Hopkins family planning program met the </p><p>disapproval of local Imams.  Even though it will no longer be </p><p>a USAID facility after September 30, most Kano residents will </p><p>not know that its status has changed.  Moreover, ADF is also </p><p>an entity of the USG.  While this office is a good distance </p><p>from the Old City, it could again become the target of </p><p>protests, as it is the only institution identified with the </p><p>USG north of Abuja.  The British Council maintains a large </p><p>premises in the Old City of Kano, and that building could be </p><p>a target of protests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Gusau is a likely spot for anti-American protests, </p><p>but at present there is only one American there, a priest. </p><p>It is unlikely that the Zamfara state government would permit </p><p>a protest that would target the Catholic church in Gusau, </p><p>because Governor Sani does not want the public-relations </p><p>problems that would ensue.  However, political demonstrations </p><p>in Gusau have sometimes turned violent there because of </p><p>fierce political rivalries.  Zaria, the capital of Islamic </p><p>learning in Nigeria and home of the Nigerian Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood, would likely see some protests centered on </p><p>Ahmadu Bello University.  There is at least one AmCit in </p><p>Zaria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  While small protests in Sokoto are possible, there </p><p>are few Americans who might be targeted.  The Sultan of </p><p>Sokoto has publicly condemned the terrorist attack on several </p><p>occasions, and would likely work with Governor Bafarawa to </p><p>prevent any large-scale protests there.  While Kaduna could </p><p>have small demonstrations, it is not likely to see </p><p>large-scale protests, given its recent experience with </p><p>devastating mob-violence.  Seven local police stations have </p><p>been built in the hotspots in and around Kaduna and are </p><p>staffed with paramilitary Mobile Police, who would serve as a </p><p>strong deterrent to any major protests.  The recent violence </p><p>in Jos, the devastating loss of life there and the continued </p><p>presence of the military on the streets make it an unlikely </p><p>venue for protests.  Jos could re-ignite if fighting starts </p><p>elsewhere and GON attention and resources are directed </p><p>elsewhere; we are not confident that civil authorities can </p><p>maintain order in Jos without military support at this time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  The large, unplanned and often squalid urban </p><p>communities outside Abuja could see demonstrations by </p><p>Muslims.  Since Abuja, like Jos and Kaduna, has an ethnically </p><p>and religiously diverse population, protests here by Muslims </p><p>could potentially spark violence driven by tensions over </p><p>other, unrelated issues.  Fortunately, Abuja is even more </p><p>diverse than either Kaduna or Jos, so the potential for a </p><p>community polarizing completely (most residents everybody </p><p>taking one side or the other in a conflict) is lower. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) There are several institutions in Abuja identified </p><p>with the USG, including the Embassy, USAID\'s offices and the </p><p>American School.  The USAID building and the Sheraton and </p><p>Hilton hotels (where most American visitors stay) are all </p><p>within walking distance of the National Mosque, and could </p><p>possibly see protests.  However, protests flowing from the </p><p>National Mosque have, in the past, been peaceful and remained </p><p>in the close vicinity of the Mosque.  There are other Juma\'at </p><p>Mosques in Abuja, but we are not aware of any of them ever </p><p>having been the focus or launch point of a protest in the </p><p>past.  The police maintain a strong presence in Abuja, and </p><p>can be expected to protect U.S. diplomatic institutions.  It </p><p>is more likely that protests, and conflict, would originate </p><p>in the densely-populated outlying residential districts, </p><p>which we estimate have a collective population of over one </p><p>million, mostly recent arrivals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  While Nigerians or transnationals could try to </p><p>attack U.S. installations or personnel in Nigeria, this has </p><p>not happened yet.  Short of a targeted attack, the greatest </p><p>danger to Mission personnel in Abuja and Lagos, and Amcits </p><p>generally, is crime and civil unrest.  We met with Amcits in </p><p>Kano and Abuja September 20 to discuss security issues, and </p><p>are planning to meet with or contact remaining Amcits in the </p><p>North and Middle Belt over the coming week.  Funds </p><p>permitting, Consulate Lagos will send consular officers to </p><p>visit wardens Enugu, Calabar, Port Harcourt, Warri, and </p><p>Ibadan next week, as well as providing an ACS officer to </p><p>support Abuja\'s outreach and emergency preparedness efforts. </p><p>There is no consular officer assigned to Abuja at this time. </p><p>Abuja held a Town Meeting for local AmCits on Thursday, </p><p>September 20. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Both Embassy Abuja and Consulate Lagos have taken </p><p>all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of </p><p>Mission personnel and assets.  RSOs at both installations </p><p>have requested and received increased support from the </p><p>Nigerian National Police and have held emergency preparedness </p><p>briefings for all official Americans in the country.  These </p><p>briefings will expand next week to include the American </p><p>schools in Lagos and Abuja. In Lagos, U.S. business </p><p>representatives will also be briefed.  RSOs constantly </p><p>monitor security conditions in their areas and brief Mission </p><p>management on any changes in the present security posture of </p><p>Mission personnel and assets.  RSOs at both installations </p><p>have requested and received increased support from the </p><p>Nigerian National Police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  EACs in Abuja and Lagos are considering tripwires </p><p>that might indicate a seriously  deteriorating security </p><p>environment and will report findings during the week of </p><p>September 24. Nigeria\'s elite is strongly pro-American but </p><p>there is a caveat in their support.  Among our best contacts </p><p>representing Nigeria\'s elite, there is universal condemnation </p><p>of the attack.  However, having expressed their condolences, </p><p>many of our franker interlocutors -- human rights activists, </p><p>lawyers, and journalists, for example, get around to adding </p><p>that U.S. policy on certain international issues has </p><p>engendered anti-U.S. sentiment in many parts of the world. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
