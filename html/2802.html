U.S. MISSION REPRESENTATIVES MET WITH FAO LOCUST EXPERTS </p><p>ON APRIL 17 TO DISCUSS FAO LOCUST CONTROL ACTIVITIES IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  FAO PROVIDED A STATUS REPORT ON LOCUST CONTROL </p><p>BY PROVINCE AND DISCUSSED CONCERNS OVER PRESSURES, IN CERTAIN </p><p>AREAS OF AFGHANISTAN, FOR FAO AND COOPERATING PARTNERS TO </p><p>PROVIDE FOOD TO FARMERS AS PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATING IN </p><p>MECHANICAL LOCUST CONTROL.   U.S. MISSION OPINED THAT UNDER </p><p>"NORMAL" CONDITIONS FOOD IN EXCHANGE FOR LOCUST CONTROL MAY </p><p>NOT BE A GOOD IDEA IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABILITY;  HOWEVER , </p><p>AFGHANISTAN MAY BE A SPECIAL CASE WHERE THIS OPTION SHOULD  BE </p><p>CONSIDERED TO AVOID A SERIOUS OUTBREAK.  FAO AGREED TO MONITOR </p><p>THE SITUATION CLOSELY AND TO PROVIDE U.S. MISSION/USAID WITH </p><p>FREQUENT UPDATES ON THE SITUATION. FAO ALSO EXPRESSED THE NEED </p><p>FOR DONOR SUPPORT OF A LONGER-TERM LOCUST CONTROL EFFORT IN </p><p>THE REGION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01963  01 OF 02  221426Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON APRIL 17 THE U.S. MISSION\'S HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS </p><p>ATTACHE, TIM LAVELLE AND PROGRAM SPECIALIST JANE STANLEY MET </p><p>WITH THE FOLLOWING LOCUST EXPERTS IN FAO\'S PLANT PRODUCTION </p><p>AND PROTECTION DIVISION: DR. ABDERRAHMANE HAFRAOUI, HEAD OF </p><p>THE LOCUST, OTHER MIGRATORY PESTS AND EMERGENCY OPERATIONS </p><p>GROUP; DR CLIVE ELLIOTT, SENIOR OFFICER FOR MIGRATORY PESTS, </p><p>AND DR. ANNIE MONARD, LOCUST CONTROL OFFICER.   DR. MONARD WAS </p><p>IN AFGHANISTAN IN FEBRUARY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DESIGN OF </p><p>CURRENT LOCUST CONTROL ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AS BACKGROUND, FAO ADVISED THAT THEY SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>IMPLEMENTED MECHANICAL LOCUST CONTROL ACTIVITIES IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN FROM 1990 TO 2000, AND PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING TO LOCAL FARMERS </p><p>AND AFGHAN AGRICULTURE OFFICIALS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD.  FAO </p><p>DID NOT PROVIDE LOCUST CONTROL ASSISTANCE IN 2001 AND </p><p>THEREFORE THERE ARE NO RECENT SURVEYS OF THE EXTENT OF THE </p><p>PROBLEM.  IN 2001,  WFP DID SUPPORT SOME MECHANICAL LOCUST </p><p>CONTROL ACTIVITIES UNDER A FOOD FOR WORK ACTIVITY IN BAGHLAN </p><p>PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE CURRENT SITUATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   FAO STATED THAT A TOTAL OF 90,000 COMMUNITY MAN-DAYS HAVE </p><p>BEEN MOBILIZED TO DATE FOR MECHANICAL LOCUST CONTROL EFFORTS. </p><p>FAO IS NOT CURRENTLY PROVIDING FOOD AS PAYMENT FOR LOCUST </p><p>CONTROL. THERE HAD BEEN SOME RESISTANCE TO THIS IN BAGHLAN </p><p>PROVINCE WHERE WFP SUPPORTED LOCUST CONTROL UNDER A FOOD FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01963  01 OF 02  221426Z </p><p>WORK PROGRAM.   FAO\'S EFFORTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MECHANICAL </p><p>CONTROL MEASURES BY LOCAL FARMERS AND AGRICULTURE OFFICIALS, </p><p>WITH SOME CHEMICAL CONTROL IN ROCKY AND INACCESSIBLE AREAS. </p><p>CHEMICAL CONTROL MAY ALSO BE USED IN AREAS LIKE BAGHLAN WHERE </p><p>THERE HAS BEEN RESISTANCE TO COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION.   THE </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCES, WHERE LOCUSTS ARE </p><p>MOST ABUNDANT, IS AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>SAMARGAN:  THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IS MOBILIZED AND THE LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS FULLY SUPPORTIVE WITHOUT FOOD PAYMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BAGHLAN:  THIS IS WHERE LOCAL FARMERS RECEIVED FOOD AS PAYMENT </p><p>FOR LOCUST CONTROL IN THE PAST AND THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS </p><p>WITH COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION.   FAO\'S REPRESENTATIVES IN THE </p><p>FIELD NOW REPORT THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN OVERCOME AND THAT </p><p>THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR HAS AGREED TO MOBILIZATION IN RETURN FOR </p><p>FUEL TO GET VEHICLES TO THE FIELD.  FAO IS ALSO INITIATING </p><p>CHEMICAL CONTROL IN THIS PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>KUNDUZ:  MECHANICAL CONTROL WITHOUT FOOD FOR WORK IS UNDERWAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTO7660 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01963  02 OF 02  220554Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      USNW-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   M-00     NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   IRM-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  SA-00    ECA-00   PRM-00   SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------8984E9  220559Z /38 </p><p>P 220450Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 3359 </p><p>AMEMBASSY KABUL PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ISLAMABAD </p><p>AMEMBASSY ALMATY </p><p>AMEMBASSY DUSHANBE </p><p> </p><p>AMEMBASSY ASHGABAT </p><p>AMEMBASSY TASHKENT </p><p>AMEMBASSY BISHKEK </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2101 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2632 </p><p> </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001963 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01963  02 OF 02  220554Z </p><p>STATE FOR IO AND SA/PB </p><p>USAID FOR AA/DCHA, AA/ANE, DCHA/FFP, DCHA/OFDA, USAID/KABUL </p><p>AND USAID/ALMATY </p><p>GENEVA FOR NKYLOH/USAID </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR KFULLER AND KDEBLAW </p><p>USUN FOR LSHESTACK </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, EAGR, AORC, FAO, UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  FAO LOCUST CONTROL EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>AND THE SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>JAWZJAN: EGG BEDS WERE DESTROYED BY SAND STORMS. </p><p>FARYAB/TAKHAR/BADAKSHAN:  DUE TO HIGH ALTITUDES, HATCHING OF </p><p>EGGS HAS NOT BEGUN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FAO EXPERTS FURTHER NOTED THAT WHILE THEY HOPE EARLY </p><p>ACTION WITH MECHANICAL AND A LITTLE CHEMICAL CONTROL WILL BE </p><p>EFFECTIVE, THESE EFFORTS ARE MERELY PALLIATIVE.  WHAT IS </p><p>REALLY NEEDED IS AN INITIATIVE DIRECTED AT LONG TERM </p><p>PREVENTION.  IN PARTICULAR, SURVEYS ARE NEEDED IN SEMI ARID </p><p>AREAS TO LOCALIZE AND CONTAIN LOCUSTS BEFORE THEY BECOME A </p><p>PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  US MISSION REP STATED THAT ACHIEVING RESULTS IS OF UTMOST </p><p>IMPORTANCE AT THIS STAGE IN THE REHABILITATION EFFORTS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.   HE OPINED THAT AFGHANISTAN IS NOT A "NORMAL" </p><p>SITUATION AND THAT FAO MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER OPTIONS (SUCH AS </p><p>FOOD AID PAYMENT FOR MECHANICAL LOCUST CONTROL) THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD NOT OTHERWISE USE IN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.  FAO WAS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01963  02 OF 02  220554Z </p><p>URGED TO MONITOR THE SITUATION CLOSELY, ESPECIALLY IN BAGHLAN. </p><p>IT WAS FURTHER AGREED THAT FAO WOULD PROVIDE U.S. </p><p>MISSION/USAID WITH FREQUENT UPDATES ON THE SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>FUNDING FOR LOCUST CONTROL </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  FAO ADVISED THAT CURRENT FUNDING IS ADEQUATE FOR ITS SHORT- </p><p>TERM LOCUST CONTROL EFFORTS.  THE BREAKDOWN IS AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>USAID/OFDA     USD. 260,000 </p><p>FAO            USD. 300,000 </p><p>DFID/UK        USD. 260,000 </p><p>ECHO /EC       USD. 300,000 </p><p>TOTAL          USD. 1,120,000 </p><p> </p><p>8.  FAO REPS DID EXPRESS A NEED FOR FUNDING OF LONGER TERM </p><p>LOCUST CONTROL EFFORTS, INCLUDING THE REHABILITATION OF THE </p><p>AFGHAN PLANT PROTECTION DEPARTMENT AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A </p><p>SOUTHWEST ASIA REGIONAL LOCUST CONTROL COMMISSION (WHICH WOULD </p><p>ALSO INCLUDE THE CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS AND PAKISTAN), </p><p>SIMILAR TO THE REGIONAL LOCUST COMMISSIONS FAO IS SUPPORTING </p><p>IN AFRICA. U.S. MISSION REPS OFFERED TO PASS ALONG ANY FUNDING </p><p>REQUESTS TO APPROPRIATE USAID PERSONNEL IN WASHINGTON AND THE </p><p>FIELD. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01963  02 OF 02  220554Z </p><p>9. USMISSION RELAYED THE MESSAGE THAT: (1) FAO MANAGEMENT MUST </p><p>FOCUS ON "MOVING FROM PLAN TO ACTION;" AND (2) LET\'S NOT LET </p><p>THE "PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD." FAO IS STRONGLY </p><p>ENCOURAGED TO RATCHET UP WHEREVER APPROPRIATE ITS EFFORTS WITH </p><p>LOCAL AIA AUTHORITIES, NGOS AND OTHERS IN THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>FAMILY. WE DO BELIEVE THAT, WITH FAO\'S SPECIAL RELIEF </p><p>OPERATIONS (TCOR) SERVICE (DR. ANNE BAUER AND RICHARD CHINA) </p><p>PRESENTLY MANAGING THE OVERALL FAO RESPONSE IN AFGHANISTAN, A </p><p>RENEWED SENSE OF URGENCY IS BEING INSTILLED. </p><p> </p><p>10. MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
