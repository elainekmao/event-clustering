WE BELIEVE THOSE MEETINGS </p><p>INDEED MARK A HISTORIC MOMENT IN ADVANCING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY, AS WELL AS IN ESTABLISHING A MORE STABLE AND </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE US RELATIONSHIP.  THE INF TREATY THAT I </p><p>SIGNED WITH THE GENERAL SECRETARY IS CLEARLY A LANDMARK </p><p>ACHIEVEMENT: FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY OUR TWO </p><p>NATIONS HAVE AGREED TO REDUCE OUR NUCLEAR ARSENALS, NOT </p><p>JUST LIMIT THEIR GROWTH.

THE </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY UNDERSTANDS THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR </p><p>RELATIONSHIP CAN RESULT ONLY IF WE SERIOUSLY ADDRESS THE </p><p>ENTIRE FOUR-PART AGENDA: HUMAN RIGHTS, REGIONAL CONCERNS, </p><p>BILATERAL MATTERS AND ARMS REDUCTIONS.  WE HAD A FRANK </p><p>AND VERY LIVELY EXCHANGE ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES, AND </p><p>WHILE WE DID NOT MAKE BREAKTHROUGHS IN EVERY AREA, I AM </p><p>ENCOURAGED BY THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH GORBACHEV IS </p><p>CONSIDERING OUR POINT OF VIEW. </p><p> </p><p>BEST WISHES FOR A HAPPY NEW YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>SINCERELY, RONALD REAGAN </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DEPARTMENT HAS NO INTENTION OF RELEASING TEXT BUT HAS </p><p>NO OBJECTION SHOULD GOT CHOOSE TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
