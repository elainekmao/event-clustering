USUN 2351 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 4697 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 5240 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM GREGORY L. BERRY.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  According to the UN officials cited in ref A, </p><p>possible military action involving Iraq would interrupt the </p><p>functioning of the oil-for-food program.  Suppliers of O-F-F </p><p>goods whose delivery could not be confirmed by UN officials </p><p>in Iraq would therefore not be paid under the current rules </p><p>governing the program.  The Jordanian Central Bank governor </p><p>had previously described to us (ref B) the financial disarray </p><p>this would cause for the Jordanian banking system, which at </p><p>any one time has up to $500 million in letters of credit </p><p>outstanding to finance O-F-F trade through Jordan.  In </p><p>effect, Jordanian banks, not suppliers, could be left holding </p><p>the bag if O-F-F trade were interrupted, a burden the </p><p>governor did not think the banking system could bear. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The governor asked about U.S. thinking on possible </p><p>modifications of UN rules that would reduce the risks for </p><p>Jordanian banks.  It is likely that Jordanian officials will </p><p>raise this problem in the high-level discussions between U.S. </p><p>and Jordanian economic officials we expect over the next </p><p>month.  We believe it will be useful to engage on this issue, </p><p>which is in addition to the other economic ramifications of </p><p>hostilities involving Iraq described in the recent Jordanian </p><p>draft paper (ref c). </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
