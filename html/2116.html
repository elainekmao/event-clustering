<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 MANAMA 003641 </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y - ADDED DUSHANBE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 10/29/11 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, AF, BA </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMIR TO SECRETARY POWELL ON AFGHANISTAN\'S </p><p>          FUTURE: GET A GOVERNMENT ON THE GROUND </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 187567     B) MANAMA 3624 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RONALD E. NEUMANN.  REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) SUMMARY. BAHRAIN\'S AMIR WELCOMES THE U.S. FOCUS </p><p>ON REPLACING THE TALIBAN AND FORMING A BROAD-BASED </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  HE URGED THAT WE GET SOME FORM OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT ON THE GROUND QUICKLY TO BECOME A LEGITIMATE </p><p>SPOKESMAN FOR AFGHANISTAN AND TURN THE TALIBAN INTO </p><p>INSURGENTS.  WITH SUCH A STEP HE THINKS THE LENGTH OF </p><p>THE WAR WILL BECOME LESS IMPORTANT, AND WITHOUT IT THE </p><p>PUBLIC PROBLEM WILL GROW.  HIS PS: CAN\'T YOU DO </p><p>SOMETHING ON PULLING THE PLUG ON AL JAZEERA? WE DO NOT </p><p>RECOMMEND THIS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) DURING THE CALL BY SECRETARY OF THE NAVY GORDON </p><p>ENGLAND ON BAHRAIN\'S AMIR SHAIKH HAMAD BIN ISA OCTOBER </p><p>29, THE AMBASSADOR REVIEWED SECRETARY POWELL\'S ORAL </p><p>MESSAGE ON AFGHANISTAN (REFTEL A).  THE AMIR AGREED WITH </p><p>THE THRUST OF CREATING A BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT KEEPING </p><p>THE UN IN THE LEAD ON ASSISTANCE, AND THE REMOVAL OF THE </p><p>TALIBAN ("ESSENTIAL").  HOWEVER, THE AMIR FOCUSED HIS </p><p>ATTENTION ON THE NEED TO MOVE SPEEDILY TO PUT AN AFGHAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT ON THE GROUND.  HE MADE CLEAR THAT IT IS THE </p><p>SYMBOLISM AND NOT THE REALITY OF CONTROL THAT HE </p><p>BELIEVES IS ESSENTIAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S) HIS RECOMMENDATION IS, ESSENTIALLY, TO GET AS </p><p>BROAD BASED A GROUP AS POSSIBLE, AND GET THEM ON TO THE </p><p>GROUND, AND CALL THEM A GOVERNMENT.  HE DOES NOT BELIEVE </p><p>IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THEY BE IN KABUL.  THEY COULD BE </p><p>CLOSE TO THE BORDER AND DEALING WITH REFUGEE ISSUES. </p><p>ALTERNATIVELY, THEY COULD BE IN MAZAR-I-SHARIF IF THE </p><p>TOWN CAN BE SEIZED.  THE AMIR\'S POINT IS THAT ONCE A </p><p>GROUP CALLING ITSELF THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT CAN BEGIN TO </p><p>SPEAK FROM THE SOIL OF AFGHANISTAN THEY CAN RAPIDLY TAKE </p><p>ON THE MANTLE OF AUTHORITY, AND PUSH THE TALIBAN INTO </p><p>THE ROLE OF INSURGENTS FIGHTING IN THE HILLS.  THIS WILL </p><p>ALLOW A COUNTERPOINT TO THE POPULAR VIEW THAT THE U.S. </p><p>IS WAGING WAR ON, RATHER THAN TO LIBERATE AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) SUBSIDIARY POINTS MADE BY THE AMIR INCLUDED THE </p><p>NEED TO PROTECT THE NEW GOVERNMENT WITH ISLAMIC, NOT </p><p>U.S. FORCES, AND THE RECOMMENDATION THAT SITES FOR </p><p>DISCUSSING AND LAUNCHING SUCH A GOVERNMENT INCLUDE </p><p>CONSIDERATION OF SAUDI ARABIA, PREFERABLY MECCA, TO GIVE </p><p>IT A HOLY CAST.  HE THOUGHT TURKEY, AND PERHAPS, </p><p>PAKISTAN WOULD BE HELPFUL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S) THE AMIR ALSO LAID INTO AL JAZEERA WITH EVEN </p><p>MORE THAN HIS USUAL GUSTO.  HE DECLAIMED AT LENGTH ON </p><p>HOW DANGEROUS THIS STATION IS, HOW IT IS ESSENTIALLY </p><p>ONE-SIDED PROPAGANDA, AND ALLEGED THAT THE AL JAZEERA </p><p>CORRESPONDENT IN KABUL (HE WAS SOME UNCERTAIN HERE, IT </p><p>COULD HAVE BEEN KANDAHAR) IS ACTUALLY NOT A JOURNALIST, </p><p>BUT AN "AFGHAN ARAB."  HIS BASIC THRUST WAS TO ASK </p><p>WHETHER THE UNITED STATES AND SAUDI ARABIA COULD NOT </p><p>SOMEHOW PULL THE PLUG OF ARABSAT AND MAKE AL JAZEERA </p><p>OCCASIONALLY DISAPPEAR FROM THE AIRWAVES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  COMMENT:  THE AMIR IS FIXATED WITH THE NEED TO </p><p>SHOW POLITICAL MOVEMENT ON THE GROUND IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p>THE FIXATION IS AN ACTION-ORIENTED MANIFESTATION OF THE </p><p>GENERAL PUBLIC FRUSTRATION THAT THE BOMBING IS NOT BEING </p><p>LINKED, IN WAYS THEY CAN SEE, TO AN ARTICULATED </p><p>POLITICAL STRATEGY EXTENDING BEYOND ANTI-TERRORISM.  THE </p><p>AMIR AND THE PUBLIC HERE WANT TO KNOW ALSO THE </p><p>CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD SHAPE AN END TO THE CURRENT PHASE </p><p>OF THE WAR.  IN THE ABSENCE OF BENCHMARKS TOWARDS WHICH </p><p>WE CAN BE SEEN TO BE PROCEEDING, THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN </p><p>BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN.  AS TO AL JAZEERA, </p><p>THERE IS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THE BAHRAINIS AND THE </p><p>QATARIS AND THE GOB HAS NEVER FELT MORE THAN CORDIAL </p><p>DISTASTE FOR AL JAZEERA, EVEN AT THE BEST OF TIMES.  WE </p><p>WATCH AL-JAZEERA REGULARLY.  SOME OF THE COVERAGE -- BUT </p><p>NOT ALL -- IS BIASED.  BUT WHAT IS HURTING US BADLY IS </p><p>THE VISUALS, WOUNDED CIVILIANS AND DESPERATE REFUGEES, </p><p>NOT THE COMMENTARY.  IF AL JAZEERA WAS TURNED OFF, WE </p><p>SUSPECT ITS POPULARITY WOULD SIMPLY PASS TO THE EVEN </p><p>WORSE HIZBALLAH SATELLITE STATION AL MANAR, WHICH IS </p><p>ALSO BROADCASTING CURRENTLY FROM AFGHANISTAN. FINALLY, </p><p>ASSAULTING THE MEDIA WOULD DAMAGE OUR OWN CREDIBILITY. </p><p>IN SHORT, WE ARE REPORTING THIS VIEW, NOT ADVOCATING IT. </p><p> </p><p>MINIMIZE CONSIDERED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEUMANN </p><p></p></div>
