<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001078 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT, EUR/NB </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  06-19-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PHUM, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  In positive news for peace process, Norwegian </p><p>facilitators touch base with the Tamil Tigers </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1075, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Joseph L. Novak, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  After a brief hiatus in contacts, </p><p>Norwegian facilitators met with the Tamil Tigers on </p><p>June 18.  Norwegian Ambassador Brattskar told us the </p><p>Tigers complained about the June 14 sinking of one of </p><p>their ships and denied culpability for a wave of recent </p><p>assassinations.  The group also said it was waiting for </p><p>new proposals from the GSL re an interim structure for </p><p>the north/east.  The fact that the meeting took place is </p><p>positive news.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MEETING WITH TIGERS:  After a brief hiatus in </p><p>contacts, Norwegian government facilitators met June 18 </p><p>with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). </p><p>(Note:  The LTTE had last met with the Norwegians just </p><p>before the Tokyo donors conference, which took place </p><p>June 9-10.  The group -- which did not attend Tokyo -- </p><p>had seemingly been avoiding contact with the GoN and </p><p>much of the rest of the international community since </p><p>that time.)  The meeting took place in the LTTE- </p><p>controlled town of Kilinochchi in northern Sri Lanka. </p><p>In a June 19 conversation with Charge, Norwegian </p><p>Ambassador Hans Brattskar, who led the GoN side at the </p><p>meeting, related that the 90-minute meeting was cordial. </p><p>He said S.P. Thamilchelvam, the LTTE\'s political chief, </p><p>seemed to go out of his way to be diplomatic and </p><p>friendly.  (Note:  In a late June 18 posting, the pro- </p><p>LTTE website "TamilNet" provided a very brief, neutral- </p><p>sounding report on the meeting, complete with several </p><p>photos.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) TIGER COMPLAIN RE SHIP INCIDENT:  Aside from the </p><p>relatively upbeat atmospherics, Thamilchelvam made clear </p><p>that the LTTE had deep concerns over the sinking of one </p><p>of its ships during a confrontation with the Sri Lankan </p><p>Navy (SLN) on June 14 (see Reftels).  Thamilchelvam </p><p>complained that the SLN acted completely without </p><p>provocation in sinking the ship and without any concern </p><p>for the fate of the LTTE crew.  (Note:  Twelve LTTE </p><p>personnel are presumed dead in the incident.  Despite </p><p>Thamilchelvam\'s assertions, it is still not clear </p><p>whether the LTTE crew detonated the ship or whether it </p><p>was sunk by SLN gunfire.  For its part, the SLN says the </p><p>LTTE blew up the ship.)  Thamilchelvam, Brattskar </p><p>continued, also complained that the SLN had utterly </p><p>failed to involve the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka Monitoring </p><p>Mission (SLMM) in its June 14 operation, as it should </p><p>have per understandings related to the February 2002 </p><p>ceasefire accord.  Brattskar, urging the LTTE to act </p><p>with restraint, noted to Thamilchelvam that the SLMM was </p><p>investigating the incident and would be reporting its </p><p>conclusions soon.  (Note:  The SLMM report is reportedly </p><p>due out next week.  We understand that the SLMM cannot </p><p>yet prove the SLN\'s contention that the LTTE\'s ship was </p><p>carrying arms-related items, nor can it prove the LTTE\'s </p><p>contention that the ship was an "oil tanker.") </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) DENIAL OF INVOLVEMENT IN KILLINGS:  The </p><p>Norwegian side also raised the issue of the recent wave </p><p>of assassinations of anti-LTTE Tamils.  (Note:  Over 30 </p><p>opponents of the Tigers have been killed in recent </p><p>months -- See Reftels.  In one particularly notorious </p><p>incident, a senior-level Tamil politician was shot and </p><p>killed in Jaffna on June 14.  The Tigers are almost </p><p>certainly responsible for the slayings.)  Thamilchelvam </p><p>denied in vociferous fashion that the Tigers had carried </p><p>out the killings.  He went on to assert that Sri Lanka </p><p>had a "culture of political violence," which should be </p><p>held accountable for the killings, north and south.  In </p><p>the larger interests of the facilitation effort, </p><p>Brattskar said he did not press the matter further with </p><p>Thamilchelvam.  He said Norway would continue to treat </p><p>the issue as a high priority, however. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) INTERIM STRUCTURE IDEA:  Regarding the overall </p><p>peace process, Brattskar said he had tried to brief </p><p>Thamilchelvam on the results of the Tokyo conference. </p><p>Thamilchelvam, however, did not evince much interest in </p><p>the matter.  Re engagement with the GSL, Thamilchelvam </p><p>said the LTTE still awaited further details from the </p><p>government regarding the formation of an interim </p><p>administrative structure in the north/east.  (Note: </p><p>Thamilchelvam expressed zero interest in ideas raised by </p><p>GSL Minister G.L. Peiris on June 16 re forming "district </p><p>development committees" in the north/east as a prelude </p><p>to agreement on an interim structure -- See Reftels.) </p><p>Brattskar replied that he understood that the government </p><p>was working on the matter, but it would take some more </p><p>time.  Thamilchelvam gave no indication that the Tigers </p><p>planned to re-engage the GSL in peace talks soon. </p><p>(Note:  The Tigers suspended their participation in the </p><p>face-to-face talks with the government in late April.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) (((Note:  When asked, Brattskar responded that </p><p>Thamilchelvam did not mention the U.S. in any way.  He </p><p>said Thamilchelvam did -- echoing recent postings on </p><p>"TamilNet" -- warn about "outside interference" in the </p><p>peace track.  Brattskar took this as a vague reference </p><p>possibly to the U.S. and perhaps to some other members </p><p>of the international community.))) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) NORWAY\'S NEXT STEPS:  Brattskar said the GoN was </p><p>encouraged that the meeting had gone forward.  The LTTE </p><p>had been difficult to get hold of for a period, but it </p><p>now seemed willing to discuss matters with the GoN. </p><p>When queried, Brattskar replied that it seemed possible </p><p>that Norwegian facilitators might even be meeting with </p><p>the LTTE\'s London-based spokesman Anton Balasingham, </p><p>soon.  Re Japan, Brattskar said he was not sure, but he </p><p>did not think that Japanese government representatives, </p><p>including Special Envoy Akashi, had had any luck </p><p>arranging meetings with the LTTE as of yet.  (Note:  We </p><p>have heard the same from the Japanese Embassy.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  Based on Brattskar\'s comments, the </p><p>Tigers made no commitment to re-engage the GSL soon, </p><p>preferring to complain about the recent ship sinking </p><p>incident, for example.  The fact that the meeting took </p><p>place is positive news, however.  For weeks now, the </p><p>group had been issuing ever more harsh sounding </p><p>statements re the peace process, as Tamil opponents of </p><p>the group were being gunned down.  In the meantime, </p><p>since Tokyo, the Tigers had also been virtually </p><p>incommunicado as far as the Norwegians were concerned. </p><p>With the group back in touch with the GoN, the peace </p><p>process -- which had been getting a bit ragged around </p><p>the edges -- might pick up some much needed momentum. </p><p>Nonetheless, the Tigers, who seem to go through volatile </p><p>mood swings regarding the peace track, remain a real </p><p>wildcard.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>NOVAK </p><p></p></div>
