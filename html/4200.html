Erdogan reportedly </p><p>told Simitis that cooperation with Greece would have a </p><p>positive impact on Turkey\'s relations with the EU.  EU </p><p>accession seems to be Erdogan\'s top priority, and he is </p><p>expected to begin a European tour within ten days, papers </p><p>note.  Meanwhile, dailies speculate that Abdullah Gul, who </p><p>is supported by the party\'s grassroots and well known </p><p>abroad, is the most likely figure to emerge as Prime </p><p>Minister.  Abdulkadir Aksu, a former ANAP member and a </p><p>minister during the Ozal\'s era, is seen as another good </p><p>candidate.  Bulent Arinc, a hard-liner on certain sensitive </p><p>issues such as the headscarf, has the support of Islamists </p><p>and is viewed as another possible candidate.  Koksal Toptan, </p><p>who left DYP to join AKP just before the election, might be </p><p>chosen to show that AKP has indeed moved to the center </p><p>right, papers speculate.  On the other hand, papers report </p><p>that CHP leader Baykal, leader of the parliamentary </p><p>opposition, has extended an olive branch to Erdogan by </p><p>saying he is ready to help AKP to abolish the political ban </p><p>on Erdogan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets; business community: Dailies report that the markets </p><p>reacted positively to AKP\'s election victory - the stock </p><p>exchange rose by 6.1 percent, and the Turkish Lira </p><p>strengthened against the Dollar.  Turkish Union of Chambers </p><p>(TOBB) Chairman Hisarciklioglu welcomed the single-party </p><p>government, and added that from now on politicians would </p><p>have no excuses for not implementing economic and political </p><p>decisions.  Ali Coskun, AKP deputy chairman for the economy, </p><p>said that legal regulations for meeting IMF demands would be </p><p>passed by the parliament.  IMF Turkey Desk Chief Kahkonen </p><p>said that the outcome of the fourth review would depend on </p><p>the attitude of the new government.  IMF Spokesman Conny </p><p>Lotze welcomed AKP messages supporting the IMF-sponsored </p><p>economic stability program.  Fitch Ratings said on Monday </p><p>that it has maintained Turkey\'s B rating after the election. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Defeated leaders to quit: Following the decision of MHP </p><p>leader Bahceli to quit politics, ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz </p><p>said on Monday that he would step down from party leadership </p><p>and leave active politics in December at an extraordinary </p><p>party congress.   DYP leader Tansu Ciller also announced </p><p>that she would leave the party leadership.  A decade-long </p><p>rivalry between the leaders of the two center-right parties </p><p>has brought about the end of each, reports comment.  Prime </p><p>Minister Ecevit on Monday presented his resignation to </p><p>President Sezer.  Ecevit will remain in office until a new </p><p>government is formed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>International reaction to Turkey\'s polls:  All papers report </p><p>that State Department Spokesman Boucher congratulated AKP </p><p>for its election victory, and urged the coming government to </p><p>continue political and economic reforms, and to make efforts </p><p>to solve the Cyprus problem.  Assistant SecState Grossman, </p><p>following his meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou </p><p>in Athens, said that Turkey is a NATO ally and a democratic </p><p>country, and that the U.S. is ready to work with the new </p><p>government.  The Greek Foreign Ministry voiced hope that the </p><p>new Turkish government would enhance Turkey\'s EU entry bid. </p><p>British Prime Minister Blair has welcomed the election </p><p>victory of AKP.  The German government welcomed AKP\'s vow to </p><p>continue with the EU accession drive, and asked for </p><p>continued cooperation with the IMF.  The EU Commission </p><p>expects Turkey to meet EU criteria.  EU foreign policy chief </p><p>Solana said that the Turkish people have opted for democracy </p><p>and welfare.  EU expansion commissioner Verheugen\'s office </p><p>said that the EU is not biased toward the new government, </p><p>but would wait to see concrete actions.  Verheugen called on </p><p>the new government to prevent torture, and to release people </p><p>jailed for non-violent expression of opinion.  Verheugen </p><p>noted that the former pro-Kurdish parliamentarian Leyla Zana </p><p>is still in prison, and stressed that the EU Commission and </p><p>EU Parliament were sensitive about this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TGS Chief in U.S.: Head of TGS General Ozkok has begun </p><p>meetings in the U.S., `at a time Washington is busy drafting </p><p>war plans about Iraq,\' "Radikal" reports.  During his five- </p><p>day stay in the U.S., Ozkok and his delegation will meet </p><p>with high-level Defense, State and White House officials, </p><p>reports say.  The Iraqi operation will be the top priority </p><p>at the meetings, in which bilateral military cooperation and </p><p>regional developments will also be discussed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Turkish Elections </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Landslide Election" </p><p>Cengiz Candar wrote in the Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(11/5): "The collapse of the center-right and center-left </p><p>does not necessarily take us to a radical environment.  On </p><p>the contrary, the AKP victory indicates that `the radical </p><p>environment\' is moving towards the center.  The Turkish </p><p>people\'s message to AKP is this: We do not consider you the </p><p>continuation of RP or FP [the two former pro-Islamic </p><p>parties].  The AKP\'s 35 percent electoral support should be </p><p>interpreted in this way. . It seems that the AKP has got the </p><p>message right, which can be seen in senior AKP officials\' </p><p>statements. . Turkey has left  `old-fashioned politics\' </p><p>behind.  Turkey will not be a paradise for corruption any </p><p>more.  The November 3 elections represented a political </p><p>earthquake, and more will follow, it seems." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Opportunities Before the AKP" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in the mass appeal Milliyet (11/5): </p><p>"Western diplomats hope that the AKP will not get involved </p><p>in `adventures\', i.e. changing the direction of Turkish </p><p>diplomacy.  As a matter of fact, I do not see that this is </p><p>going to happen.  I believe the AKP government will preserve </p><p>the ongoing trends of Turkish diplomacy.  This is actually </p><p>dictated by Turkey\'s geographical location as well as by </p><p>international circumstances.  The new Turkish government </p><p>will have to make very important decisions on foreign </p><p>issues, and the conditions will force AKP to take courageous </p><p>steps.  That is a double chance for the AKP government; to </p><p>prove its maturity as well as to pave the way for Turkey\'s </p><p>progress." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"AKP and CHP to the EU Capitals Together" </p><p>Taha Akyol highlights the enhanced cooperation for the EU in </p><p>the mass appeal Milliyet (11/5): "Even before the elections, </p><p>AKP leader Erdogan had requested that EU ambassadors in </p><p>Ankara arrange for him to meet with their Prime Ministers. </p><p>Right after the election results were announced, we see some </p><p>concrete developments in this area.  Erdogan will first </p><p>visit Greece, and there is also a positive response from </p><p>Italy.  The AKP leader is waiting for an appointment from </p><p>the German Prime Minister.  . The determination of AKP to </p><p>intensify its efforts for EU accession is also a positive </p><p>sign for the stability of the economy, not to mention that </p><p>it eliminates some worries or pre-conceived ideas about the </p><p>AKP.  . Erdogan will also ask CHP leader Deniz Baykal for </p><p>support in the EU shuttle diplomacy.  He might even ask CHP </p><p>to provide a group to join the AKP delegations during its </p><p>visits to Europe, or ask CHP to conduct some of the EU </p><p>visits.  It is a good thing that Erdogan is seeking </p><p>cooperation with CHP without any prejudices. . Erdogan\'s </p><p>method of politics actually reminds me of the late Prime </p><p>Minister Ozal and his golden years in politics between 1984 </p><p>and 1987.  AKP leader Erdogan is acting with maturity and a </p><p>sense of responsibility. Thus he must be given a chance to </p><p>prove himself." </p><p></p></div>
