<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000497 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, NP, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON TIBETAN REFUGEES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 101 </p><p> </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 411 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Michael S. Hoza, Reasons 1.5 (b),(d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  A UNHCR monitoring visit to the Tibet border </p><p>was postponed after a promised Home Ministry permit failed to </p><p>materialize.  The Australian Embassy has expressed an </p><p>interest in helping to coordinate representations on Tibetan </p><p>refugee issues.  One of ten Tibetan refugees in custody on </p><p>immigration charges gave birth February 19.  UNHCR met with </p><p>her March 7; she and the baby are fine.  A self-described, </p><p>but undocumented, Tibetan "tourist" from China at first </p><p>claimed to police that he was not seeking refugee protection, </p><p>but changed his story after meeting with Tibet Office staff. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>UNCHR Monitoring Visit Pushed Back </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) UNHCR cancelled a planned March 4-6 monitoring visit </p><p>to Kodari, on the Nepal-China border, at the last minute </p><p>after a promised letter of permission from the Home Ministry </p><p>failed to materialize.  UNHCR had obtained oral permission </p><p>for the mission from Home Ministry Joint Secretary Tikka </p><p>Niraula, but hesitated to proceed without an official </p><p>document in hand.  Home Ministry officials have pledged to </p><p>provide the letter, and UNHCR staff plan to travel as soon as </p><p>they obtain it. </p><p> </p><p>Australian Interest in Tibetan Refugees </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Emboffs met March 6 with the Australian Ambassador and </p><p>DCM to discuss Tibetan refugee issues.  The Australian </p><p>Embassy had received inquiries from Members of Parliament </p><p>about the year-on decline in refugees transiting Kathmandu </p><p>(Ref A) and the ten refugees in detention on immigration </p><p>charges (Ref B).  The Australian Ambassador expressed </p><p>interest in coordinating representations to Nepal on refugee </p><p>issues with the U.S. and other nations.  We agreed to keep </p><p>one another informed and to coordinate our approaches in </p><p>future.  (Note:  When Poloff contacted the Australian DCM in </p><p>mid-February to inform him that Post was urging the Home </p><p>Ministry to consider granting amnesty to the ten refugees, he </p><p>replied that his Embassy had not yet made a decision on </p><p>whether or not to weigh in.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Detained Tibetan Refugee Gives Birth </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) One of the ten Tibetan refugees currently detained </p><p>on immigration charges (Ref B) gave birth January 19.  The </p><p>child, a boy, was healthy and had apparently been carried to </p><p>term.  The mother, aged 19, was also in good health following </p><p>the delivery.  She had concealed her pregnancy until the very </p><p>end.  Her condition became apparent only after labor pains </p><p>began and she was taken to a hospital.  Nepali authorities </p><p>provided the new mother with Nepali Rupees 100 (USD 1.30), </p><p>special rations for sixty days, and at least five meters of </p><p>swathing cloth, as they do to every female inmate who gives </p><p>birth.  A UNHCR protection officer met with her jailers and a </p><p>representative of the police women,s cell March 1, and </p><p>informed them orally that UNHCR would pay all expenses </p><p>related to the care of the woman and her child, and </p><p>subsequently met with the woman herself March 7. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Initially, the woman refused to see visitors, and at </p><p>first declined visits from both the UNHCR protection offer </p><p>and the Dalai Lama,s representative to Nepal.  She also </p><p>refused to see a staff member from the Tibetan Reception </p><p>Center, who had visited the jail to deliver food and clothing </p><p>to her.  The UNHCR protection officer, an ethnic Tibetan, </p><p>suspected that the woman, who is unmarried, avoided meeting </p><p>visitors because she felt ashamed and dreaded having to </p><p>answer questions about her baby. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Children born to women in Nepal,s jails typically </p><p>remain with their mothers in custody until they reach </p><p>primary-school age.  The woman has not revealed the identity </p><p>of the father; the child was apparently conceived when the </p><p>woman was in India, before she traveled to Nepal.  Nepali </p><p>citizenship is not conveyed automatically to the native born, </p><p>but rather only through patrimony.  Nepali law allows for the </p><p>release of a jailed mother for 60 days so that she can return </p><p>home to care for her newborn, and UNHCR is exploring the </p><p>possibility of taking responsibility for her during that </p><p>period. </p><p> </p><p>Another Arrest in Kathmandu </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) On January 28, an undocumented Tibetan from China </p><p>was picked up by police on the main street in front of </p><p>Nepal\'s Royal Palace and detained on immigration charges.  He </p><p>reportedly told authorities that he had come to Nepal as a </p><p>tourist, that it was "easier" to travel without papers than </p><p>to take the trouble to get a passport and visa, and that he </p><p>had no fear of returning to China.  The man, who speaks </p><p>English, signed an English-language statement to that effect. </p><p> He was fined Nepali Rupees 11,000 (USD 142), plus USD 46 in </p><p>visa fees. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Tibet Office Representative has offered to pay </p><p>the fine in order to secure man\'s release.  UNHCR has </p><p>discouraged this approach for the precedent it would set. </p><p>Further complicating matters, after a meeting with a Tibetan </p><p>Welfare Center staffer, the man claimed he had changed his </p><p>mind and now wanted to go to India.  A UNHCR officer plans to </p><p>interview the man in coming days to determine his real wishes </p><p>regarding refugee status.  (Comment:  Tibetans transit </p><p>through Nepal for a variety of reasons; this arrest is yet </p><p>another example of how Tibetan migration has become a two-way </p><p>street.  Post will continue to work with Nepal to ensure that </p><p>Tibetans fleeing persecution in China can pass safely through </p><p>Nepal.  End Comment.) </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
