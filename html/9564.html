<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004503 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: AL TAJAMMOUAT QIZ PLANS BIRTHDAY BASH, U.S. </p><p>INVITES PENDING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive But Unclassified; please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Al Tajammouat QIZ park manager Halim Salfiti is </p><p>planning in September to commemorate four years of successful </p><p>QIZ activity at his industrial park.  The event will </p><p>highlight Tajammouat\'s success at bringing in investment and </p><p>creating local jobs, and will formally inaugurate the </p><p>"village workers" program designed by Salfiti.  Salfiti also </p><p>hopes to use the celebration (and anticipated participation </p><p>by King Abdullah) as a hook to bring major U.S. garment </p><p>buyers and potential investors to Jordan to see the QIZ </p><p>success story.  We will be working with Washington agencies </p><p>to support this event, including possibly encouraging a trade </p><p>and investment delegation to Jordan targeting QIZ businesses. </p><p> </p><p>TAJAMMOUAT TURNS FOUR </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  The Al Tajammouat industrial park in south Amman, </p><p>approved by Federal Register notice in October 1999, has been </p><p>the fastest-growing QIZ in Jordan over the past four years. </p><p>According to park management, the park now employs some </p><p>13,000 people, including approximately 8-9,000 Jordanians, </p><p>and claims to have the most invested capital ($150 million) </p><p>and operating firms (23) of any park involved in the </p><p>initiative.  The park, located near the Sahab industrial </p><p>estate and very close to Queen Alia International Airport, </p><p>was also one of the first to attract non-textile business, </p><p>welcoming a West Bank-based jewelry manufacturer in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>3. (u)  Tajammouat has been an innovator in the QIZ </p><p>community.  One of the park\'s occupants, New York-based </p><p>Cannon County Knitting Mills, has set the standard for labor </p><p>development and community outreach by QIZ factories, and was </p><p>as a result nominated by post for the 2001 Award for </p><p>Corporate Excellence. Park Manager Halim Salfiti launched in </p><p>2002 a "village workers program," which recruits workers from </p><p>poverty-stricken towns in Jordan\'s south (including Ma\'an and </p><p>Tafileh, traditional social unrest hot-spots) to live in </p><p>U.S.-standard dormitories on the QIZ park site and work in </p><p>QIZ factories.  The program has been an unqualified success, </p><p>drawing raves from factory owners, the workers themselves, </p><p>and even the governor of Tafileh.  The program currently </p><p>employs some 400 workers, but Salfiti hopes to double that </p><p>number as soon as additional dormitory space becomes </p><p>available. </p><p> </p><p>LIGHTS, CAMERA, QIZ! </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  Salfiti, clearly impressed by the buzz created at </p><p>the Dead Sea World Economic Forum and proud of the park\'s </p><p>success so far, has decided to commemorate the fourth </p><p>anniversary of the Park\'s approval with a gala dinner and </p><p>sound and light show that will also serve as an investment </p><p>promotion tool.  Salfiti plans to invite current and </p><p>prospective investors to the event, along with CEO\'s of major </p><p>U.S. garment buyers.  He has also begun planning with the </p><p>Palace to secure attendance at the dinner by King Abdullah </p><p>and Queen Rania. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  Salfiti hopes to hold the event in mid- to </p><p>late-September, pending the King\'s availability.  He is </p><p>considering as an alternative holding the event in parallel </p><p>with the Joint Economic Commission meeting to be held in </p><p>Amman in the fall, to use expected high-level USG </p><p>participation in the JEC as a "hook" to encourage </p><p>participation by U.S. garment buyer CEO\'s.  He has approached </p><p>the Embassy/FCS for assistance with attracting U.S. buyer </p><p>interest in the event. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Salfiti\'s planned event is very similar to one the </p><p>Embassy tried to help the Jordan Investment Board put </p><p>together in Spring 2002, but which died from lack of </p><p>follow-up on the part of JIB.  Salfiti is much more likely to </p><p>follow through, and has already committed over $100,000 to </p><p>the event and hired an event planner who was involved in the </p><p>Dead Sea WEF to make arrangements.  He is ready to commit </p><p>additional funds and/or fundraise in the QIZ and GOJ </p><p>communities to make this event a success, and needs our help </p><p>to deliver the U.S. buyers. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (u)  We will work with Salfiti and the Palace on </p><p>invitations, and will identify and send support letters from </p><p>the Ambassador to invited CEO\'s.  We will be in contact with </p><p>interested Washington agencies about supporting this event, </p><p>including possibly inviting CEO\'s out as a formal trade </p><p>delegation led by an appropriate-level USG representative </p><p>from Commerce or USTR. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
