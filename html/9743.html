<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 000900 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EAP/PD (KOVACH), IIP/G/IR (BORYS), IIP/G/EAP </p><p>(HOLDEN), IIP/T/CP (CLACK) </p><p>INFO R (KFOSTER), BCLTV (GLAZEROFF) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OIIP, KDEM, PGOV, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: BURNING FOR BOOKS IN BURMA: HIGH SUCCESS </p><p>WITH LOW TECH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  American Center publications and </p><p>library programs are currently enjoying new highs of </p><p>popularity.  The military government of Burma </p><p>censors the press, dictates radio and television </p><p>broadcasts, limits access to the internet, and </p><p>controls every educational institution across Burma, </p><p>creating a hunger for unbiased and free information. </p><p>Public Affairs Rangoon\'s strategy to promote </p><p>American values relies on old-school information </p><p>delivery techniques:  paper products in the form of </p><p>books, magazines, and pamphlets.  Despite lean </p><p>economic times and less disposable family income for </p><p>most Burmese, the past months have seen a steady </p><p>increase in new library memberships and in </p><p>subscriptions to post publications.  While the trend </p><p>predates the May 30 ambush of democracy leaders, PAS </p><p>experienced a large uptick in attendance in June </p><p>when populations were particularly hungry for </p><p>uncensored information from abroad about events in </p><p>their own country. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>LINING UP FOR LIBRARY CARDS </p><p>------- </p><p>2. During the month of June, Four hundred and fifty </p><p>new members enrolled in the Library/IRC and 6,724 </p><p>patrons walked through its doors and checked out </p><p>4,108 books, cassettes, and videotapes.  The </p><p>Library\'s patrons are overwhelmingly young adults. </p><p>Nearly 60 percent of those visiting in June were </p><p>university students.  Another 25 percent were </p><p>students of English and high school graduates </p><p>waiting for places to open at Rangoon\'s </p><p>universities.  The remaining patrons included </p><p>medical doctors, government bureaucrats, teachers, </p><p>lawyers, and other professionals. </p><p> </p><p>3. Public and university libraries are only poorly </p><p>stocked and maintained.  Government restrictions </p><p>limit content and little funding means most books </p><p>are dated, if not worm-eaten.  Only the libraries </p><p>run by the American Center and the British Council </p><p>offer anything close to a modern, comprehensive </p><p>library.  Even with the American Center\'s modest </p><p>collection of 8,000 volumes and 70 periodicals, the </p><p>demand for our services is strong and continues to </p><p>rise.  At just 500 kyat (about 50 cents) a year, </p><p>most any Burmese can afford to join the American </p><p>Center Library.  New memberships have averaged 370 a </p><p>month, and are climbing, since December 2002.  One </p><p>recent Saturday in July, 173 new members joined. </p><p>The Library now has nearly 11,000 active members. </p><p> </p><p>4. The demand for library services is not limited to </p><p>Burmese living in Rangoon.  Just prior to the May 30 </p><p>crackdown on democracy activists, the American </p><p>Center Library went on the road to participate for </p><p>the first time in the book fairs of two universities </p><p>outside of Rangoon, the Bago Degree College and Pyay </p><p>University.  The universities were enthusiastic </p><p>about collaboration with the American Center.  They </p><p>assisted us in gaining permission from the Ministry </p><p>of Education and the Ministry of Information to </p><p>display our books on their campuses and even </p><p>rescheduled their fairs for our benefit when the </p><p>Ministry of Information delayed granting approval. </p><p>(The Ministry granted its permission after </p><p>physically inspecting all sixty books intended for </p><p>our display.) </p><p> </p><p>5. At the book fairs, the American Center displayed </p><p>about 60 titles covering environmental science, </p><p>globalization, HIV/AIDS, and drug abuse.  Professors </p><p>and students alike browsed our traveling collection, </p><p>some stopping to read intently.  Many teachers wrote </p><p>down the titles and authors and requested IRC </p><p>assistance in acquiring these books for use in their </p><p>courses.  Good dictionaries and titles on the </p><p>environment were in particular demand on both </p><p>campuses. </p><p> </p><p>6. We took the rare opportunity of being on campus </p><p>to distribute free copies of post produced </p><p>publications.  At Pyay, pandemonium ensued when word </p><p>spread that the American Center was giving books </p><p>away, and the line to receive them soon snaked out </p><p>the door of the exhibit hall.  In total, more than </p><p>1,800 copies of American Center produced magazines </p><p>were distributed along with nearly 1,000 books from </p><p>the American Center book translation program. </p><p>Titles distributed included "Democracy in America" </p><p>by De Tocqueville, "My American Journey" by Colin </p><p>Powell, and other biographies and works of fiction. </p><p> </p><p>7. Bago Degree College has about 1500 full time </p><p>students while another 10,000 attend as distance- </p><p>learners.  All are undergraduate students.  Pyay </p><p>University boasts a student population of roughly </p><p>5,000 (of which three quarters are undergraduate </p><p>students) with another 20,000 enrolled in their </p><p>distance learning courses.  The DPAO and the </p><p>American Center Library team, accompanied by the </p><p>Bangkok Regional Librarian Officer, feel confident </p><p>they greeted a high percentage of both student </p><p>bodies.  Both Bago Degree College and Pyay </p><p>University invited American Center participation in </p><p>their 2004 book fairs. </p><p> </p><p>B.  NEW LOOK, NEW APPEAL FOR PERIODICALS </p><p>------ </p><p>8. Following a makeover and a subscription drive </p><p>that closed recently, paid subscriptions to post- </p><p>produced publications in English and Burmese (see </p><p>para 10) rose more than 27 percent over last year. </p><p>(A total of 24,200 subscriptions in 2003, over </p><p>19,013 subscriptions for 2002.)  Our press and </p><p>publications staff injected a more vital feel to our </p><p>venerable publications, with more articles meant to </p><p>appeal to youth and the use of vibrant colors and </p><p>tag lines to make features stand out.  In addition </p><p>to increased subscriptions, positive reader feedback </p><p>has also surged. </p><p> </p><p>9. The American Center\'s printing press publishes </p><p>over 700,000 pages of material every month. </p><p>Contractors translate some materials, exchange </p><p>participants and other Center contacts write </p><p>original articles, and American Center staff edits </p><p>the whole.  Then in-house staff, led by a </p><p>professional graphic artist, designs each </p><p>publication, does the camera work, plate-making, and </p><p>four color printing.  By running a printing press </p><p>inhouse, PAS eliminates one avenue of pressure the </p><p>Burmese government could use to delay our </p><p>publications. </p><p> </p><p>10. Description of periodical publications: </p><p> </p><p>a. American News & Views (circulation:  fewer than </p><p>100) is the Post\'s daily newsletter, based entirely </p><p>on Washington File\'s EPF section.  It is edited in- </p><p>house for substance and clarity.  ANV is aimed at </p><p>laying the groundwork for future media placement. </p><p>By limiting distribution to fewer than 100, the </p><p>American Center may circumvent the Press Scrutiny </p><p>Board (government censor board) review of content. </p><p> </p><p>b. News & Features USA (circulation:  6,975) is a </p><p>biweekly containing backgrounders from the </p><p>Washington File, Electronic Journals, etc. </p><p> </p><p>c. American Mosaic (circulation:  8,757) is a </p><p>monthly publication containing articles from the VOA </p><p>Special English program.  Written in simple English, </p><p>the publication is targeted to young Burmese </p><p>students of English. </p><p> </p><p>d. Lin Yaung Chi USA (circulation:  8,468) is a </p><p>bimonthly Burmese-language publication providing </p><p>information and knowledge about various aspects of </p><p>the United States. Targeted readers are the general </p><p>Burmese public. </p><p> </p><p>e. Enduring Freedom (circulation: 10,000) a monthly </p><p>Burmese-language publication published in support of </p><p>the global war on terrorism.  It is distributed free </p><p>at the IRC, as an insert in other publications and </p><p>by embassy personnel.  Entire issues have been </p><p>reprinted in the progressive bimonthly journal, </p><p>Light of Islam (circulation 6,000).  In the months </p><p>following September 11, 2001, the newsletter was </p><p>published monthly.  Leading up to and during the </p><p>recent conflict in Iraq, EF was published weekly. </p><p>One entire issue of Enduring Freedom detailed Saddam </p><p>Hussein\'s crimes against the Iraqi people. </p><p> </p><p>11. PAS Rangoon also runs an active book translation </p><p>program.  In FY 2002, two books were translated into </p><p>Burmese:  Katherine Graham\'s "Personal History" and </p><p>Secretary Powell\'s "My American Journey."  The </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Secretary\'s autobiography passed the censor board in </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>record time and was a swift seller, popular with </p><p>both democratic opposition and military government </p><p>types. (The embassy hopes it conveyed positive </p><p>images of healthy military-civilian relations and </p><p>roles, but has yet to see any manifestation of such </p><p>influence in the Burmese military rulers.)  Thomas </p><p>Friedman\'s "The Lexus and the Olive Tree" will head </p><p>to press in September and Paul Krugman\'s "The </p><p>Accidental Theorist" in December. Henry Hazlitt\'s </p><p>"Economics in One Lesson" is already in process for </p><p>2004 publication. </p><p> </p><p>C. SATISFYING THE HUNGER BEYOND RANGOON </p><p>------ </p><p>12. Comment:  There is a hunger for information </p><p>across Burma.  Because the media is not free and the </p><p>education system is failing, many people look to the </p><p>American Center to help fill in gaps created by the </p><p>regime.  The crowds visiting the American Center in </p><p>Rangoon daily testify to that.  And whenever </p><p>American Center staff are able to travel, we see </p><p>firsthand the hunger for information and contact in </p><p>places like Pyay or Bago or Mandalay.  Although a </p><p>particularly conservative military commander governs </p><p>the second largest city, Mandalay, the people of </p><p>that city come to our programs in larger than </p><p>expected numbers. </p><p> </p><p>13.  In their own effort to extend beyond the </p><p>capital, the British Council made a one-time </p><p>endowment with year 2000 funds to create ten </p><p>Millennium Centers (similar to our American Corners </p><p>concept but focused exclusively on English language </p><p>education) housed at community civil society </p><p>organizations -- often the local YMCA or a church- </p><p>based learning center -- in secondary cities across </p><p>the country.  The British Council also opened a </p><p>satellite office/reading room in Mandalay.  The </p><p>American Center actively supports the Millenium </p><p>Centers with English teaching materials donations </p><p>and by conducting English teacher training courses </p><p>for their personnel. </p><p> </p><p>14. In a country where the communication </p><p>infrastructure is archaic and the government </p><p>controls the media, the American Center relies on </p><p>tried and true public diplomacy tools.  In other </p><p>countries, what Edward R. Murrow called "the last </p><p>three feet" might be closed by a modem or by a </p><p>televised interview.  But not in Burma.  In Burma, </p><p>"old-school" brick and mortar and "low-tech" paper </p><p>and ink consistently reach our hungry young audience </p><p>with a high degree of success.  Only with more of </p><p>each will we reach farther.  End Comment.  MCMULLEN </p><p></p></div>
