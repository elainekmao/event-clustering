<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L USUN NEW YORK 005825 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, UNSC, MOPS, PHUM, SO </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFSOOL - UN WOULD LIKE TO CONSULT WITH US ON </p><p>TROOP CONTRIBUTIONS TO "OPERATION RESTORE HOPE" </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL: ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: IN DECEMBER 7 MEETINGS WITH AMBASSADOR </p><p>PERKINS, THE SYG AND USG GOULDING ASKED THE US TO </p><p>CONSULT WITH THE UN ON TROOP CONTRIBUTIONS BEFORE MAKING </p><p>FINAL DECISIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN SUCCESSIVE MEETINGS DECEMBER 7 BOUTROS GHALI AND </p><p>USG GOULDING URGED US CONSULTATION WITH THE UN PRIOR TO </p><p>FINALIZING DECISIONS FOR TROOP CONTRIBUTORS TO </p><p>"OPERATION RESTORE HOPE".  B-G EXPLAINED THAT WHILE THE </p><p>UN HAD NO DESIRE TO SECOND GUESS US JUDGMENTS, THE UN </p><p>HAD BOTH SYMBOLIC AND SUBSTANTIVE CONCERNS TO CONSIDER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  FIRST, THE UN WANTED TO AVOID THE IMPRESSION THAT IT </p><p>WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE LOOP ON A UN AUTHORIZED </p><p>OPERATION, SO SOME KIND OF VISIBLE LINK WOULD REINFORCE </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION.  SECONDLY, IT WAS LIKELY </p><p>THAT SOME UNIFIED COMMAND CONTINGENTS WOULD BE ASKED TO </p><p>STAY ON FOR SERVICE IN A REVIVED UNOSOM.  THE UN WANTS </p><p>TO BE SURE THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE UNITS CHOSEN WOULD </p><p>BE SUITABLE FOR THAT PURPOSE AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE </p><p>TO OFFER ITS THOUGHTS TO THE US BEFORE OUR DECISIONS ARE </p><p>A FAIT ACCOMPLI.  FROM THE UN\'S PERSPECTIVE, B-G </p><p>LAMENTED, A FURTHER FACTOR WAS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE </p><p>US APPEAL FOR PARTICIPATION IN "OPERATION RESTORE HOPE" </p><p>WOULD SIPHON OFF TROOP CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WOULD </p><p>OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR THE LARGE UPCOMING </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE OPERATION AS WELL AS THE OBSERVER MISSIONS IN </p><p>ANGOLA AND SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  AMBASSADOR PERKINS SAID THAT A CONSTANT PUBLIC </p><p>IMPRESSION OF "HONEST COLLABORATION" WAS IMPORTANT TO </p><p>MAINTAIN.  THE PROPOSED CONSULTATION WOULD BE DESIRABLE </p><p>FOR BOTH SIDES AND COULD OCCUR VIA REGULAR MEETINGS </p><p>BETWEEN THE UN AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE JOINT </p><p>CHIEFS.  THESE COULD ALSO PROVIDE THE CONTENT FOR </p><p>REGULAR REPORTS BY THE SYG TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL.  IN </p><p>A MEETING WITH USG GOULDING AND PERKINS LATER IN THE </p><p>DAY, JCS REP ARNOLD AGREED TO TRY TO ARRANGE FOR A FULL </p><p>UPDATE ON TROOP CONTRIBUTION OFFERS DECEMBER 9, WHEN </p><p>ADMIRAL BOWMAN AND AMBASSADOR GROVE WILL VISIT UN </p><p>HEADQUARTERS FOR CONSULTATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PERKINS </p><p></p></div>
