<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002208 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 34 (4/11 1630 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Embassy Amman was closed for the first day of the </p><p>local weekend on April 11, and will be closed for the second </p><p>day of the weekend on April 12.  American staff movements </p><p>remain restricted. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Absent any significant events, Embassy Amman will </p><p>take Saturday, April 12 off.  Our next sitrep will be on </p><p>Sunday, April 13. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) No new developments to report. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) King Abdullah and Queen Rania in a joint interview </p><p>with the official Petra news agency April 10 said that it is </p><p>the duty of every Jordanian to assist the Iraqi people and to </p><p>support efforts to provide necessary aid to Iraqis.  The King </p><p>called on the army to set up a field hospital to treat Iraqi </p><p>wounded, and said he might ask the army to set up a second as </p><p>well.  The King told the Embassy that he wants the hospital </p><p>to be in Iraq, probably at ar-Ramadi on the Amman-Baghdad </p><p>highway.  The King also ordered that a number of injured </p><p>Iraqis be brought to Jordan for medical treatment as soon as </p><p>it is safe for them to make the journey.  Information </p><p>Minister Mohammed Adwan said that first priority of Jordan </p><p>should be to help Iraqis "overcome this predicament."  He </p><p>declared that the Iraqi people must be the ones to determine </p><p>their own future. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Police report that the situation was calm throughout </p><p>Jordan April 11. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  FM Marwan Muasher April 10 again publicly denied </p><p>reports that Jordan is talking to Israel about the </p><p>possibility of re-opening the Mosul-Haifa oil pipeline. </p><p>Speaking to al Jazeera, Muasher said warming of relations </p><p>between Jordan and Israel would be contingent upon further </p><p>movement on the Roadmap.  Energy Minister Batayneh reiterated </p><p>Muasher\'s denial to local press, noting the pipeline has been </p><p>out of use since 1948.  According to the local Arabic daily </p><p>Al Rai on April 10, portions of the line are in serious </p><p>disrepair, and other portions are currently being used to </p><p>convey water.  Visual inspection of the line by ECON FSN </p><p>confirmed a pipeline in seriously dilapidated condition.  It </p><p>is unlikely to be feasible to re-open the line (a 12-inch </p><p>line with a likely capacity of only 200,000 bpd that would </p><p>need wholesale rehabilitation), though an argument could be </p><p>made in the future to construct a new line. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) UNHCR reports a small trickle of TCNs into Jordan </p><p>April 10-11, but was unable to provide specific numbers or </p><p>nationalities. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Post understands that a group of journalists who </p><p>crossed the Jordan-Iraq border late afternoon on April 10 on </p><p>its way to Baghdad, including CBS anchor Dan Rather and </p><p>several other Amcits, has arrived safely in Baghdad.  Another </p><p>group of journalists, including several Amcits, crossed the </p><p>border early April 11 and are reported to be at a 101st </p><p>Airborne checkpoint short of Baghdad.  We also understand </p><p>that some other journalists of undetermined nationality </p><p>crossed the Jordan-Iraq border headed for Baghdad later on </p><p>April 11, but we have no information on there whereabouts. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
