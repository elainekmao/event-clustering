<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000984 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND PRM </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p>GENEVA FOR THOMAS-GREENFIELD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PREL, NP, CH, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: CHINESE PRESSURE NEPAL TO DEPORT TIBETANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 0753 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 0715 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  On May 29 Office of Tibet Representative </p><p>in Kathmandu Wangchuk Tsering reported that the Department of </p><p>Immigration was preparing to hand over to representatives of </p><p>the Chinese Embassy 18 Tibetans detained for immigration </p><p>violations.  The Government of Nepal (GON) has also asked the </p><p>UNHCR to hand over three Tibetan minors, originally detained </p><p>with others in the group but later released into UNHCR </p><p>custody, for deportation as well.  Emboffs have intervened </p><p>with both the Department of Immigration and the Home Ministry </p><p>to press them not to deport the Tibetans, who have been </p><p>declared "persons of concern" by UNHCR, but prospects of </p><p>non-deportation appear bleak.  Most alarming is the direct </p><p>intervention by Chinese diplomats, who had heretofore applied </p><p>discreet pressure on the GON to dissuade refugees, in </p><p>attempting to secure the Tibetans\' deportation.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  On May 29 Office of Tibet Representative Wangchuk </p><p>Tsering reported to poloff that a member of his Office had </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>run into Chinese diplomats at the Department of Immigration </p><p>when he went there to pay the fines for 18 Tibetans detained </p><p>in a Kathmandu jail since April 15 on immigration violations </p><p>(Refs A and B). According to Tsering, the Chinese had </p><p>apparently already paid the immigration fines for the 18 </p><p>(plus a 19th Tibetan who had been arrested separately on </p><p>similar charges), and the Department of Immigration was </p><p>preparing to hand them over to the Chinese for deportation. </p><p>Tsering said he had already informed UNHCR, and asked the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Embassy to raise the issue with the Ministry of Home and the </p><p>Department of Immigration. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Emboff contacted Home Ministry Joint Secretary </p><p>Niranjan Baral (the Secretary was out for the day), who </p><p>professed to know nothing of the matter.  She stressed the </p><p>importance of abiding by internationally respected norms and </p><p>established past practice by handing over the detainees to </p><p>UNHCR, who has declared them "persons of concern."  Baral </p><p>undertook to look into the matter and asked poloff to call </p><p>back later.  Poloff then contacted Immigration Director </p><p>Subarna Lal Shrestha, who confirmed that the Tibetans would </p><p>be summarily deported, "as per our regulation," to China.  He </p><p>was unable or unwilling to describe what regulation mandated </p><p>their deportation (there is no extradition treaty with </p><p>China), nor would he disclose who had ordered their </p><p>deportation or paid the fines.  In response to poloff\'s </p><p>urging that the detainees be turned over to UNHCR, he </p><p>redirected her to the Home Ministry.  In a follow-up </p><p>conversation, Home Joint Secretary Baral advised that the </p><p>intervention by the US and other embassies had made the </p><p>Ministry reconsider the matter.  He and his colleagues were </p><p>thinking carefully about what to do, he said, and would most </p><p>likely defer deciding until the following day.  Poloff </p><p>reiterated the above-mentioned points and added that </p><p>deporting Tibetans (eight of whom are minors) to China would </p><p>be certain to elicit strong negative international reaction, </p><p>including from the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  UNHCR Protection Officer Cecilia Becker, who spent </p><p>several hours at the Department of Immigration in an effort </p><p>to fend off the deportation order, told poloff that she had </p><p>observed several Chinese Embassy cars throughout the day in </p><p>the parking lot.  While at the Department, she was confronted </p><p>by the Chinese DCM, who demanded that UNHCR turn over three </p><p>Tibetan minors (two aged six and one aged nine) originally </p><p>arrested with the 18, to him for deportation.  He reportedly </p><p>told her that he "had been waiting all day" for the Tibetans </p><p>to be turned over, and insinuated that UNHCR was to blame for </p><p>the delay.  Becker said that the the Department of </p><p>Immigration also asked that the three children be turned </p><p>over.  She told poloff that she will ignore the order, but </p><p>since the Home Ministry knows where the children are staying, </p><p>she fears they may be picked up anyway.  (She also confirmed </p><p>that her understanding was that the immigration fines had </p><p>been paid by the Chinese Embassy.)  She said she was </p><p>pessimistic that the Tibetans would be able to avoid </p><p>deportation, but urged the Embassy to continue its efforts. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Comment:  High-ranking Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>officials have indicated to us in the past that pressure from </p><p>the Chinese Embassy was responsible for their stricter </p><p>application to Tibetans of immigration regulations.  That </p><p>pressure heretofore had remained discreetly, if no less </p><p>effectively, behind the scenes.  The actions today of Chinese </p><p>diplomats--paying immigration fines to speed deportation and </p><p>confronting UNHCR representatives with a demand that they </p><p>hand over minors to the Department of Immigration--should </p><p>remove any doubt of the extent of their efforts to ensure a </p><p>more draconian interpretation of immigration laws for </p><p>Tibetans attempting to transit Nepal.  The Embassy will </p><p>continue to urge the GON to respect international norms and </p><p>practice--and avoid international censure--by turning over </p><p>these "persons of concern" to UNHCR. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
