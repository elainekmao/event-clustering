THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME WAS PRAISE FOR THE </p><p>KING\'S STATEMENTS ON IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NEWS REPORTS </p><p> </p><p>JORDANIAN DAILIES ON JULY 30 WERE DOMINATED BY KING </p><p>ABDULLAH\'S MEETING WITH THE PRIME MINSTER OF BRITAIN </p><p>AND HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE TIMES, IN WHICH HE ADDRESSED </p><p>THE SITUATION IN IRAQ AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. </p><p>DAILIES HIGHLIGHTED THE FOLLOWING QUOTES: </p><p>PRINCE HASSAN\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE IRAQI OPPOSITION </p><p>MEETING WAS A GROSS ERROR, AND WE ARE WORKING TO </p><p>RECTIFY THE SITUATION. </p><p>JORDAN WOULD NOT BE THE LAUNCHING GROUND FOR ANY </p><p>AMERICAN OPERATIONS. </p><p>IT IS INAPPROPRIATE TO TARGET THE LEADERSHIP PF ANY </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p>JORDAN WARNS AGAINST A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE IN THE </p><p>OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, AND AGAINST ATTACKING IRAQ. </p><p>SECRETARY POWELL UNDERSTANDS THE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AND HIS DEPARTURE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE A </p><p>MAJOR LOSS. </p><p>[AHMAD] JALABI IS WANTED IN JORDAN FOR EMBEZZLING FUNDS </p><p>FROM A JORDANIAN BANK. </p><p> </p><p>DAILIES ALSO REPORTED THE NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE THAT </p><p>SPOKE OF AN AMERICAN PLAN TO STRIKE BAGHDAD FIRST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES </p><p> </p><p>-- THE KING\'S ANSWERS </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST BASSEM SAKEJHA WROTE IN CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON JULY 30: </p><p>"JORDAN\'S POSITION REGARDING REGIONAL ISSUES NEEDS TO </p><p>BE THE CLEAREST, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE KING, IN HIS </p><p>CNN INTERVIEW, ADDRESSED EACH OF THE TRIAL BALLOONS </p><p>RECENTLY LAUNCHED REGARDING A JORDANIAN ROLE IN THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PROBLEM AND ANOTHER IN A U.S. AGGRESSION </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ.  DESPITE ENORMOUS PRESSURE THAT STARTED </p><p>WITH LEAKS TOP THE MEDIA AND REACHED THE LEVEL OF </p><p>HINTING AT A NEW SIEGE OF AQABA, THE ROYAL POSITION IS </p><p>CLEAR AND FORTHRIGHT.  ALL JORDANIANS FEEL PROUD OF THE </p><p>KING WHO SPOKE IN THEIR NAMES, AND THAT THEIR COUNTRY </p><p>WOULD NOT BE DRAGGED INTO A GAME THAT THEY WOULD NOT </p><p>ACCEPT, AND THAT IS OPPOSED TO THEIR NATIONALIST </p><p>OUTLOOKS." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE KING\'S INTERVIEW WITH CNN </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST MAZEN AL-SAKET WROTE IN CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON JULY 30: "IT IS </p><p>OUR DUTY TO TAKE NOTE OF THE FORTHRIGHTNESS AND CLARITY </p><p>WITH WHICH THE KING EXPRESSED HIMSELF ON THE TWO MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT OCCUPY JORDANIAN PUBLIC OPINION. </p><p>THESE ISSUES REPRESENT JORDAN\'S NATIONALIST OUTLOOK </p><p>REGARDING THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE OUR NATION AND THAT </p><p>THREATEN THE REGION\'S SECURITY AND STABILITY.  ONLY </p><p>THIS POSITION THAT EXPRESSES JORDAN\'S POPULAR AS WELL </p><p>AS OFFICIAL VIEWPOINTS CAN MAKE US FACE THESE </p><p>CHALLENGES AND DANGERS SUCCESSFULLY." </p><p> </p><p>-- HAS JORDANIAN DIPLOMACY MENDED THE DAMAGE DONE BY </p><p>THE PRINCE\'S PARTICIPATION [IN ET IRAQI OPPOSITION </p><p>MEETING]? </p><p>IMPORTANT COLUMNIST SAMIH AL-MA\'AYTAH WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JULY 30: </p><p>"HIS MAJESTY THE KING SPOKE ACCURATELY WHEN HE </p><p>DESCRIBED THE PRINCE\'S MOVE AS A GROSS ERROR BECAUSE </p><p>THAT STEP CAUSED CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL DAMAGE TO </p><p>JORDAN AND ITS LEADERSHIP FAR BEYOND THE PRINCE\'S </p><p>JUSTIFICATION THAT IT WAS A PERSONAL DECISION.  THE </p><p>PRINCE FORGOT THAT HIS MOVE WAS CONSIDERED AS COMING </p><p>FORM THE JORDANIAN LEADERSHIP, WHICH NEEDED TO EXERT </p><p>CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO PERSUADE FRIENDS AND BROTHERS </p><p>THAT IT WAS NOT A PARTNER IN THIS POLITICAL STEP.  ALL </p><p>ARABS SHOULD REALIZE THAT THEY WILL BE SUBJECTED TO </p><p>CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE TO TAKE PART IN THE AGGRESSION </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ, AND THAT THE PROPER NATIONALIST POSITION </p><p>WOULD BE IN A COLLECTIVE STAND TO RESIST THESE </p><p>PRESSURES. WE HOPE THAT WE SHALL SEE SUCH A COLLECTIVE </p><p>STAND INSTEAD OF THE USUAL ARAB BEHAVIOR OF SNEAKING TO </p><p>THE AMERICANS INDIVIDUALLY AND IN SECRET."  GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
