<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 001949 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01 THE IRAQI WAR THROUGH JORDANIAN EYES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The  following  cable, which describes  Jordanian  sentiment </p><p>towards the war, was drafted by an Embassy Amman FSN. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Almost two  weeks  into  the  war,  and </p><p>Jordanians   remain   fully  engrossed   with   the   latest </p><p>developments in Iraq. Although many have resumed their daily </p><p>activities, a widening resentment towards the US has  become </p><p>virtually  a universal sentiment and an accepted  truth.  As </p><p>the   coalition   troops   push  forward,   Jordanians   are </p><p>articulating  revulsion  for  everything  American,  and   a </p><p>newfound  pride  for  everything Iraqi.  Religious  leaders, </p><p>political  opposition  parties, churchgoers  and  modernists </p><p>have all come to share a common ground: Anti-Americanism (on </p><p>the same level as Anti-Israelism). END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>JORDANIAN PRIDE IN VALIANT IRAQIS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) This collective attitude has manifested itself  in </p><p>numerous  ways. One clear example has been the rejoicing  of </p><p>many  Jordanians for the Republican Guard tanks that  bolted </p><p>out  of Basra. Following that episode, conversations shifted </p><p>from  a focus on "US arrogance" and the legality of war,  to </p><p>the bravery and toughness of the Iraqi people: "did you hear </p><p>how  the  republican guard sent 1000 vehicles to the  enemy, </p><p>they  have  guts." "The Iraqi people remain defiant  in  the </p><p>face  of  awesome US might." Articles in the  press  aim  to </p><p>complete  and confirm such sentiments with titles  such  as: </p><p>"Iraqi\'s challenge to the coalition stops their land crawl." </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>SUSTAINED RAGE </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The new levels of mistrust that many here feel for </p><p>the  US  has  only  added  to  the  frustrations  and  anger </p><p>accumulated  over years of the Intifada and  US  support  of </p><p>Israel. This war is not viewed as separate from the Israeli- </p><p>Palestinian conflict - rather it is perceived as yet another </p><p>episode  in  the  "US/Zionist  assault  on  Arabs."   People </p><p>continue to watch TV and listen to their radios just to  see </p><p>and  hear evidence for what they already believe: That  Iraq </p><p>is defending its land against neo-colonialism. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  This  sentiment is the  same  across  the  board, </p><p>although  it  is  expressed  in a  variety  of  forms.  Some </p><p>Jordanians   watch   the   news  around   the   clock   with </p><p>interruptions for lunch and work. The religious  spend  more </p><p>time  in  prayer  and in mosques. The young  and  able  join </p><p>protests and peace vigils when held. Artists paint images of </p><p>war and murals in support of Iraq. Jordan Radio plays somber </p><p>music  to reflect the mood of the country.  Some have chosen </p><p>to  cancel  weddings and parties. People  mostly  gather  at </p><p>homes of family members and close friends to watch the  news </p><p>and  talk about the war. Fundraisers and blood donations are </p><p>held  by  various  Unions  and Universities.  A  very  small </p><p>segment (mostly of upper class Jordanians) has resumed going </p><p>out  to restaurants, to movie theaters, or to the mall -  if </p><p>only  for  a respite from the tensions and emotions  of  the </p><p>moment. Whatever and however people chose to deal and handle </p><p>the  situation, all conversations lead back to the war,  and </p><p>the  general  mood  and tone of any gathering  is  ominously </p><p>unhappy and frustrated. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
