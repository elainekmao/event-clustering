<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 05238 </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMCONGEN DUBAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  SOCI, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  LIBERALIZING SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN TEHRAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  SINCE KHOMEINI\'S DEATH THE ENFORCEMENT </p><p>OF DRESS CODES AND RULES REGARDING THE APPEARANCE OF </p><p>WOMEN HAS DECREASED DRAMATICALLY, ACCORDING TO SOURCES </p><p>WHO HAVE TRAVELLED TO IRAN IN RECENT MONTHS.  REVGUARD </p><p>AND KOMITEH PRESENCE ON STREETS HAS DIMINISHED NOTICEABLY </p><p>AND AS A RESULT PROSTITUTES ARE OPENLY PLYING THEIR TRADE </p><p>ON THE STREETS OF TEHRAN, ONCE AGAIN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>NOT PARIS, BUT..... </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  ACCORDING TO RECENT TRAVELLERS TO IRAN, BOTH IRANIAN </p><p>RESIDENTS OF DUBAI, AND ONE UAE NATIONAL, WOMEN ARE </p><p>OPENLY WEARING MAKEUP ON THE STREET IN ALL NEIGHBORHOODS </p><p>OF TEHRAN, AND NOT ONLY IN THE WEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS OF </p><p>THE NORTH OF THE CITY, BUT ALSO IN THE SOUTH WHERE SUCH </p><p>AN OPEN CHALLENGE TO THE DRESS CODE WOULD NEVER HAVE </p><p>BEEN TOLERATED IN THE PAST.  AT THE SAME TIME, SEVERAL </p><p>SOURCES REPORT A BIG CHANGE IN THE STYLE OF CLOTHES </p><p>IRANIAN WOMEN ARE WEARING.  CHADORS ARE LESS PREVALENT, </p><p>AND THE STANDARD BLACK OR BEIGE RAINCOAT IS BEING </p><p>REPLACED BY FASHIONABLY STYLED, COLORED RAINCOATS.  MANY </p><p>WOMEN\'S HEJABS (HEAD SCARVES) ARE BRIGHTLY COLORED AND </p><p>ARE BEING WORN FURTHER AND FURTHER BACK ON THE HEAD, </p><p>OFTEN EXPOSING DYED HAIR.  ONE SOURCE REPORTS HAVING </p><p>SEEN WOMEN WEARING LONG-SLEEVED LONG DRESSES WITHOUT </p><p>CHADOR OR RAINCOAT COVERING.  ONLY ONE SOURCE, A DUBAI </p><p>BASED IRANIAN, REPORTS HAVING SEEN WOMEN IN THE NORTH </p><p>OF TEHRAN WEARING NO SCARF AT ALL ON THE STREET.  ONE </p><p>WOMAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE WHILE AGREEING THAT THE </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OF DRESS CODES FOR WOMEN IS BEING EASED ON </p><p>THE STREETS OF TEHRAN, SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO </p><p>SIMILAR EASING OF THE DRESS CODE FOR WOMEN WORKING IN </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  REVGUARD AND KOMITEH CONTINGENTS HAVE VIRTUALLY </p><p>DISAPPEARED FROM THE STREETS OF TEHRAN, ACCORDING TO </p><p>ALL SOURCES.  ACCORDING TO ONE SOURCE, THE KOMITEH IS </p><p>BEING INTEGRATED INTO THE GENDARMERIE AND WILL SOON </p><p>CEASE TO EXIST AS AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY.  ONE </p><p>CONSEQUENCE OF THE DECREASED PRESENCE OF THESE TWO </p><p>GROUPS IS A VISIBLE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF </p><p>PROSTITUTES ON THE STREETS OF TEHRAN.  ACCORDING TO A </p><p>UAE NATIONAL WHO HAS TRAVELLED TO IRAN SEVERAL TIMES IN </p><p>THE PAST YEAR, AND WHO WAS THERE IN THE FIRST WEEK OF </p><p>SEPTEMBER, HEAVILY MADE UP WOMEN ARE STANDING ON STREET </p><p>CORNERS THROUGHOUT TEHRAN.  THEY BOLDLY APPROACH CARS </p><p>STUCK IN TRAFFIC TO SOLICIT CUSTOMERS.  SOURCE RELATED </p><p>ONE INCIDENT HE WITNESSED WHILE BEING DRIVEN INTO TEHRAN </p><p>FROM THE AIRPORT.  A YOUNG WOMAN OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN </p><p>APPROACHED HIS CAR AND ASKED FOR A RIDE.  WHEN HIS </p><p>DRIVER ASKED WHERE SHE WANTED TO GO, SHE ANSWERED </p><p>"ANYWHERE".  THE DRIVER ASKED IF THAT MEANT SHE WANTED </p><p>TO GO WHEREVER THEY WERE GOING, SHE ANSWERED </p><p>AFFIRMATIVELY.  SHE THEN CONFESSED THAT SHE WAS "NEW" </p><p>TO THE BUSINESS AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO CHARGE OR </p><p>WHETHER TO CHARGE IN RIALS OR DOLLARS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  UAE SOURCE RECOUNTED ONE STORY WHICH WE REPORT FOR </p><p>WHATEVER VALUE IT MAY HAVE; THE STORY HAS BEEN CONFIRMED </p><p>BY THREE IRANIAN RESIDENTS OF DUBAI WHO CLAIM TO HAVE </p><p>HEARD IT FROM PEOPLE WHO VISITED KHOMEINI\'S TOMB IN THE </p><p>PAST MONTH.  SOURCE CLAIMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN </p><p>HAS BUILT A BARRIER AROUND THE GRAVE OF KHOMEINI TO STOP </p><p>PEOPLE FROM THROWING MONEY ON HIS GRAVE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>SOURCE, SHIITE PILGRIMS TRADITIONALLY THROW MONEY </p><p>WRAPPED IN PAPER OR FABRIC ON THE GRAVES OF THEIR HOLY </p><p>MEN, AND THE MONEY IS COLLECTED AND USED TO KEEP UP THE </p><p>SHRINE.  SOURCE CLAIMS THAT THE BARRIER WAS SET UP AT </p><p>KHOMEINI\'S TOMB TO STOP THE PRACTICE BECAUSE THE SMELL </p><p>WAS GETTING TOO STRONG:  MANY PEOPLE WERE THROWING </p><p>EXCREMENT WRAPPED IN PAPER ONTO THE IMAM\'S GRAVE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MACK </p><p></p></div>
