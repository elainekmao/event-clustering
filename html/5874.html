<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001153 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, E, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, EAID, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: A VERY WORRIED CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Economic Counselor Scot Marciel.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Central Bank Governor Sureyya Serdengecti </p><p>told us February 21 that, in his view, the government does </p><p>not understand the economic consequences of failing to come </p><p>to agreement on the U.S. assistance package or the IMF </p><p>program.  He is deeply worried that, based on their lack of </p><p>economic understanding, government leaders may make "fatal" </p><p>decisions.  Serdengecti insisted that any U.S. assistance </p><p>must be conditioned on performance under the IMF-backed </p><p>program, saying the government otherwise will use the funds </p><p>to finance populist programs that will lead to "catastrophe" </p><p>in a matter of months.  At the same time, he warned that the </p><p>GOT likely will blame any failure to reach agreement with the </p><p>Fund on the U.S. (i.e., U.S. blocks the IMF review so it has </p><p>an excuse not to disburse its assistance).  For this reason, </p><p>Serdengecti is urging IMF officials to adopt a higher profile </p><p>to differentiate the Fund from the U.S. in the public mind. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Central Bank Governor Sureyya Serdengecti (strictly </p><p>protect) asked to see EconCouns privately on February 21.  In </p><p>the meeting, Serdengecti said he was deeply concerned about </p><p>the government\'s efforts to de-link the U.S. assistance </p><p>package from the IMF program.  This effort, he said, raised </p><p>grave doubts about the government\'s intentions on economic </p><p>policy.  After three months in office, the government still </p><p>does not understand why it needs a stabilization/reform </p><p>program and why there is no alternative.  Anti-reform </p><p>elements in the business community are lobbying the </p><p>government to return to the old way of doing business.  Since </p><p>"no one in the government leadership understands," there is </p><p>no one to push back.  The government\'s failure to understand </p><p>economics, he said, may lead to "fatal" decisions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In this regard, Serdengecti said he was particularly </p><p>worried by Minister Babacan\'s statements that U.S. assistance </p><p>should not be linked to the IMF program.  He has been trying </p><p>for months to explain to Babacan and others that the best way </p><p>to limit the damage from an Iraq war is to implement the IMF </p><p>program.  Despite his and Treasury U/S Oztrak\'s efforts, </p><p>however, government leaders "are not aware of how fragile the </p><p>situation is.  They still think we can do without the IMF, </p><p>and in fact want to get rid of the IMF."  Normally, the </p><p>floating exchange rate regime would send warning signals that </p><p>might prompt the government to shift its stance.  However, </p><p>markets are so distorted by Iraq-related issues that they are </p><p>not sending those signals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Serdengecti argued that the U.S. should insist on </p><p>conditioning its aid on GOT performance under the Fund </p><p>program.  If not, the government will use the assistance to </p><p>finance populist policies, which will lead to "catastrophe" </p><p>in a matter of months.  At the same time, he warned, the </p><p>press already is claiming that the U.S. is blocking an IMF </p><p>deal as a way of enhancing its leverage.  If Turkey and the </p><p>U.S. reach agreement on an assistance package, but Turkey </p><p>fails to reach agreement with the Fund, Turkey will almost </p><p>certainly blame the U.S. for blocking the Fourth Review (as a </p><p>way out of U.S. assistance commitments).  For this reason, he </p><p>said, it is critical that the two issues be differentiated in </p><p>the public\'s mind.  The way to do this, he suggested, is for </p><p>the Fund to adopt a higher profile and to talk publicly about </p><p>the importance of the reform program so that it demonstrates </p><p>to the public that its decisions are independent, even if </p><p>U.S. decisions are dependent.  Serdengecti plans to raise </p><p>this idea with Fund officials shortly.   (Comment;  Minister </p><p>Babacan and others in the government already are hinting that </p><p>the IMF is being unusually and unreasonably tough, though </p><p>they have not yet explicitly blamed that toughness on us. </p><p>End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  If there is no U.S.-Turkish agreement, Serdengecti </p><p>predicts a sharp market reaction and serious financial </p><p>problems in the near future.  Unfortunately, the government </p><p>does not appreciate how serious the situation is, and seems </p><p>to think it can manage its way through without either the </p><p>U.S. assistance or the IMF program.  "Their lack of awareness </p><p>makes me very scared."  EconCouns noted that Treasury U/S </p><p>Oztrak, who understands the situation well, is still in </p><p>government and presumably is alerting the government to these </p><p>dangers.  Serdengecti responded that Oztrak had been </p><p>explaining realities for months, but "Babacan just doesn\'t </p><p>understand."  If, as the local press is reporting, the </p><p>government fires Oztrak in the coming weeks, it will </p><p>demonstrate that they really have no idea what they are doing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
