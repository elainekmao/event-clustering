<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005515 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS AND CATHY NOVELLI </p><p>STATE PASS USAID FOR TOM OLIVER </p><p>USDOC FOR MOLLY WILLIAMSON </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - LARRY MCDONALD </p><p>OPIC FOR JIM HANSLEY </p><p>CAIRO FOR AGCOUNS </p><p>CUSTOMS FOR FARAH NAIM AND LEON HAYWARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, EAGR, JO, OPIC </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S TRADE MINISTRY GEARING UP FOR JOINT </p><p>COMMISSION </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 471 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  The Ambassador delivered the USG\'s official </p><p>invitation to convene the 2002 U.S.-Jordan Joint Commission </p><p>to Jordanian Trade Minister Salah al Bashir on September 22. </p><p>Accepting the invitation, Bashir provided the GOJ\'s </p><p>preferences for dates, events, and agenda items for the Joint </p><p>Commission.  Embassy will be working in the coming weeks with </p><p>the ministry and with private sector delegation members to </p><p>ensure a substantive Washington program.  We will also be </p><p>seeking assistance from interested Washington agencies to set </p><p>up meetings and events on both the public- and private-sector </p><p>sides. </p><p> </p><p>DELEGATION COMPOSITION </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  While the GOJ has not yet decided on the exact </p><p>composition of the incoming delegation, Bashir said he </p><p>expected the total delegation size to be around 15, including </p><p>about 5 GOJ officials from the Trade Ministry and Customs and </p><p>another 10 private sector and quasi-private sector </p><p>individuals, the latter likely representing some of the more </p><p>prominent of Jordan\'s\' 23-odd trade and business </p><p>associations.  Bashir promised to have a delegation list </p><p>finalized by the beginning of next week (September 30).  Once </p><p>we have it, we will forward it to Washington and begin </p><p>setting up side meetings for private-sector delegates. </p><p> </p><p>DATES AND EVENTS </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Bashir proposed holding the official JC meeting on </p><p>October 24th.  He said the ministry would like to tie the end </p><p>of the official meeting in, via digital video conference </p><p>(DVC), to an FTA promotion seminar that will be held </p><p>concurrently in Amman and in Jordanian embassies in 5-6 other </p><p>regional capitals, with the idea that the JC principals could </p><p>briefly address the seminar and take 5-6 questions from the </p><p>field concerning the FTA.  Bashir expressed hope that USTR </p><p>Zoellick would participate in the DVC, adding he hoped to get </p><p>King Abdullah to make brief remarks as well. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  In addition to these senior-level meetings, the GOJ </p><p>would like to hold technical-level discussions on the 23rd, </p><p>both to follow up on customs issues raised during the August </p><p>Rules of Origin DVC, and to begin discussions on other </p><p>customs-related issues they plan to raise during the JC (see </p><p>proposed agenda items, below). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (u)  The GOJ has asked for our assistance in scheduling </p><p>an FTA promotional event on the 23rd to provide an </p><p>opportunity for private-sector delegates to meet U.S. </p><p>counterparts.  Since Jordanian private-sector delegates are </p><p>to be trade/business association representatives culled from </p><p>the TIJARA committee (reftel), one proposal for an </p><p>appropriate FTA promotional event was to have a large group </p><p>meeting including the Jordanian delegates and their closest </p><p>U.S. counterparts, followed by break-out meetings between </p><p>individual associations, to include their public relations </p><p>staffs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (u)  Bashir expressed a strong interest (since echoed by </p><p>the local amcham) in maximizing press coverage for the event </p><p>in order to raise awareness of opportunities under the FTA to </p><p>a broader U.S. business audience.  Optimally, Bashir said he </p><p>would like to have a "hook" for such a promotion, and </p><p>mentioned specifically the possibility of announcing the </p><p>entry-into-force of the long-awaited Bilateral Investment </p><p>Treaty.  A promotional event with the BIT announcement as a </p><p>centerpiece could be a strong draw for new investment </p><p>interest, in his view. </p><p> </p><p>AGENDA ITEMS </p><p> </p><p>7.  (u)  The GOJ intends to provide us with a detailed list </p><p>of proposed agenda items by early next week (September 30). </p><p>Broadly, they would like to accomplish the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- review the environmental management capacity assessment, </p><p>as outlined in the FTA (Note: two USAID-funded contractors </p><p>are completing the study now, and expect it to be ready for </p><p>presentation in time for the JC meeting.  End note); </p><p> </p><p>-- discuss avenues of cooperation/technical assistance to </p><p>improve Jordan\'s ability to attract FTA-related investment, </p><p>to include improving Jordanian private sector access to U.S. </p><p>marketing and distribution channels; </p><p> </p><p>-- clarify procedures for obtaining E-1 and E-2 visas, and </p><p>clarify what sort of traveler would normally seek out such a </p><p>visa; </p><p> </p><p>-- propose allowing Jordanian businesses to apply QIZ Rules </p><p>of Origin to FTA products (Note:  in the case of textiles, </p><p>this would allow fabric cut in Israel and sewn in Jordan to </p><p>qualify as Jordanian for RO purposes, in the GOJ\'s view.  End </p><p>note.); </p><p> </p><p>-- consider allowing Jordan to operate an "OPA" operation, </p><p>similar to Hong Kong, whereby cut fabric would be allowed </p><p>into Jordan for sewing and would count toward the 35% country </p><p>of origin requirement (Note:  this idea has not been entirely </p><p>fleshed out by the GOJ side; we expect further details when </p><p>we receive the detailed agenda proposals.  End note.); </p><p> </p><p>-- discuss allowing cumulation from neighboring territories </p><p>for country of origin purposes. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (u)  Note that this list is not exhaustive.  Once a final </p><p>agenda proposal is delivered, we will forward it to concerned </p><p>Washington agencies. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER MEETINGS SOUGHT </p><p> </p><p>9.  (u)  In addition to the official meeting with USTR on the </p><p>24th, Bashir will seek meetings with the following while he </p><p>is in Washington: </p><p> </p><p>-- senior-level Treasury officials, to request that Jordan </p><p>and the U.S. begin negotiations on a bilateral double </p><p>taxation convention; </p><p> </p><p>-- senior-level USDA officials, to discuss possibilities for </p><p>future food aid to Jordan, including PL 480 Title I and "Food </p><p>for Progress"; </p><p> </p><p>-- Officials at OPIC to discuss uses for the OPIC facility in </p><p>Jordan, following up on meetings with OPIC VP Cynthia </p><p>Hoestler and Jim Hansley in Amman. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
