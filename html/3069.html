<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001105 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>STATE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>ROME FOR USMISSION </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, EAID, ELAB, PHUM, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS KILL NGO WORKER; MORE WFP SUSPENSIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 871 </p><p> </p><p>INGO Staffer Tortured and Killed by Maoists </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The Plan International (PI) representative for </p><p>western Nepal\'s Bajhang district, a Nepalese national, was </p><p>tortured and killed by Maoist rebels May 31, the </p><p>organization\'s country director confirmed.  Two other men </p><p>were also killed in related incidents, according to June 3 </p><p>press reports.  PI had recently decided to evacuate its staff </p><p>from Bajhang district due to deteriorating conditions.  About </p><p>two months ago Maoists looted the Bajhang district office and </p><p>subsequently PI began to phase out operations there.  Staff </p><p>had first been sent to the district headquarters, and later </p><p>on to Nepalgunj, western Nepal\'s largest city.  The district </p><p>representative had been the last employee remaining in </p><p>Bajhang, and had planned to evacuate soon. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Suspect Informer </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The head of the Nepal Police confirmed the deaths of </p><p>the three men, adding that the Maoists suspected them of </p><p>being police informants.  Security forces had caught up with </p><p>eight insurgents the day before the killings, the IGP noted. </p><p> </p><p>Pattern Had Been Not to Harm Staff </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Maoists had previously raided Plan International </p><p>offices in several areas of Nepal, but always took care not </p><p>to harm staff, the PI country director related.  The pattern </p><p>has been that the Maoists come in, burn documents and files, </p><p>confiscate furnishings and plunder equipment.  Staff members </p><p>are given a lecture and then told to leave the area and not </p><p>to return. </p><p> </p><p>WFP Suspends Work in Two More Districts </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The World Food Program (WFP) announced May 24 that it </p><p>would suspend deliveries to a "food-for-work" program </p><p>targeted at former bonded laborers in two western Nepal </p><p>districts, Kailali and Bardiya, bordering India.  The </p><p>suspension came after Maoists looted 29.5 metric tons of rice </p><p>from a warehouse in Bardiya district May 17.  It follows the </p><p>April 24 suspension of a joint German-WFP program in two </p><p>districts in northwestern Nepal (Reftel).  WFP has announced </p><p>a "zero-tolerance" policy in response to the repeated looting </p><p>of its stocks.  The deputy head of a U.S.-based NGO who </p><p>recently visited Kailali and Bardiya estimated that in the </p><p>absence of the WFP\'s food-for-work program, its beneficiaries </p><p>would run out of food in a few months. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Judging from accounts of these and previous raids on </p><p>NGO offices, the insurgents are still not specifically </p><p>targeting aid workers.  The PI country director agreed that </p><p>their district representative was not attacked as an aid </p><p>worker per se, but rather for allegedly acting as an </p><p>individual informant.  Even so, his affiliation with an </p><p>international NGO did not protect him.  The looting of WFP </p><p>warehouses seems to have been similarly opportunistic.  These </p><p>events have made aid agencies increasingly concerned about </p><p>the safety of their projects and personnel, especially in </p><p>western Nepal. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
