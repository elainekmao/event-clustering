<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HANOI 000669 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND INL/AAE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, SNAR, SOCI, PHUM, ETRD, ECON, EAID, CB, VM, ETMIN, CNARC, ASEAN, TIP </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM AND CAMBODIA:  LOOKING FORWARD </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  Hanoi 527  B.  02 Hanoi 2980  C.  02 Hanoi 701 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  Vietnam and Cambodia have a complex </p><p>relationship with a volatile history, but both sides now </p><p>appear to focus on the future.  Cross border smuggling of </p><p>drugs and other goods as well as human trafficking have </p><p>emerged as significant problems.  Vietnam reportedly does </p><p>not view the 2001 Montagnard exodus as having much impact on </p><p>the bilateral relationship.  Border demarcation remains an </p><p>unresolved issue.  Two-way trade is quite low but there is </p><p>mild optimism.  Bilateral cooperation on Vietnamese missing </p><p>in action (MIA) is good.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>A LONG BORDER AND INTERTWINED HISTORY </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Vietnam and Cambodia share an approximately 1,000 </p><p>kilometer border, including the Vietnamese provinces (from </p><p>north to south) of Kon Tum, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Binh Phuoc, </p><p>Tay Ninh, Long An, An Giang, and Kien Giang.  Due to a </p><p>common French colonial past and, later, the "American" War, </p><p>Vietnam and Cambodia have much in common.  Vietnam\'s late </p><p>1978 invasion, according to Cambodia Embassy Counselor Tauch </p><p>Kemary, while viewed "by many, even most" as "liberating" </p><p>the country from the Khmer Rouge, also "reminded us of our </p><p>vulnerability."  There are many who continue to "fear the </p><p>Vietnamese" because "they have demonstrated the power to </p><p>dominate Cambodia at different times in our history." </p><p>Notwithstanding that episode, in recent years, the two </p><p>countries have been "trying to find more common ground" and </p><p>advance the bilateral relationship, Kemary noted. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Since the 1990s, bilateral ties have seen a slow </p><p>but steady improvement, with the signing of various </p><p>agreements.  Among the more important ones relate to: </p><p>--Trade and economic cooperation (1995); </p><p>--establishment of the Joint Committee on Economic, </p><p>Cultural, Scientific, and Technical Affairs (1995); </p><p>--cooperation between Vietnam\'s Ministry of Agricultural and </p><p>Rural Development and Cambodia\'s Ministry of Agriculture, </p><p>Forestry, and Fishery (1997); </p><p>--Anti-criminal cooperation between the two Ministries of </p><p>Interior (1997); </p><p>--Land transport cooperation (1998); </p><p>--Counternarcotics cooperation (1998); </p><p>--Education and training cooperation 2000 - 2005 (1999); </p><p>--Labor cooperation 2000 - 2002 (2000); </p><p>--Investment protection and incentives (2001); and, </p><p>--Trading, exchange of goods and trade services in border </p><p>areas (2001). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  According to information provided by Vietnam\'s </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), senior-level visits from </p><p>Vietnam to Cambodia predominate official exchanges.  Nguyen </p><p>Phuong Binh, MFA Institute of International Relations (IIR) </p><p>Deputy Director, suggested that this could be because </p><p>Cambodian government leaders are "reluctant" to appear too </p><p>close to the GVN leadership.  Visits to Vietnam "could leave </p><p>them open" to criticism from opposition politicians, she </p><p>added.  Binh predicted that this imbalance "may change as </p><p>bilateral relations continue to improve."  However, upcoming </p><p>Cambodian elections in July will "influence to what extend </p><p>and how fast relations improve," she predicted. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Since 2000, GVN leaders who have visited Cambodia </p><p>have included then-National Assembly Chairman (and now </p><p>Communist Party General Secretary) Nong Duc Manh (2000); </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung (2000); then-Minister </p><p>of Public Security Le Minh Huong (2001); President Tran Duc </p><p>Luong (2001); Minister of Defense Pham Van Tra (2002); and </p><p>National Assembly Chairman Nguyen Van An (2002).  On the </p><p>Cambodian side, high level visits included Prime Minister </p><p>Hun Sen in 1998 (on a bilateral visit) and again in 2002 (as </p><p>head of the Cambodian delegation to a tripartite meeting </p><p>with Vietnam and Laos held in Ho Chi Minh City); Foreign </p><p>Minister Hor Nam Hong in 2001; and most recently, Princess </p><p>Norodom Vachara, chairman of the National Assembly\'s Foreign </p><p>Affairs Commission, in January 2003 to discuss border issues </p><p>with Vietnam\'s National Assembly Chairman An. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>SIGNIFICANT CROSS BORDER SMUGGLING AND TRAFFICKING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The Cambodian Embassy\'s Kemary admitted that </p><p>cross-border smuggling is a "major problem" and one that "we </p><p>must continue to work on."  Drug smuggling from Cambodia, </p><p>according to DEA\'s Hanoi Country Office, includes heroin and </p><p>amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), mainly into Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City.  Some of the heroin is for domestic use and some is </p><p>transshipped to Australia.  Cambodia is Ho Chi Minh City\'s </p><p>major ATS source.  Large quantities of marijuana also enter </p><p>southern Vietnam from Cambodia, mainly for transshipment to </p><p>the PRC (Ref b).  Kemary claimed that Cambodian police meet </p><p>"regularly" with their Vietnamese counterparts; however, he </p><p>lamented that the Cambodian police have "very few" </p><p>resources" for patrolling the border areas.  Kemary also </p><p>noted that the smuggling of manufactured goods is "very </p><p>common and works against real economic growth between </p><p>Cambodia and Vietnam."  He added that most of the goods </p><p>smuggled into Vietnam come from Thailand.  He claimed that </p><p>most of this smuggling was due to "Thai criminal gangs" who </p><p>"encourage corruption" among Cambodian border officials. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Human trafficking is also a major issue.  While </p><p>few reliable statistics exist, the UN Office of Drugs and </p><p>Crime\'s (UNODC) Hanoi staff have reported that, of the </p><p>estimated 20,000 Vietnamese prostitutes in Cambodia, a </p><p>significant number are the victims of human traffickers. </p><p>Several dozen Vietnamese trafficking victims were officially </p><p>repatriated from Cambodia in 2002, but because victims tend </p><p>to avoid notoriety, experts suspect many more return through </p><p>unofficial channels.  In 2002, the International Office for </p><p>Migration (IOM) again confirmed that human trafficking from </p><p>Vietnam to Cambodia had become more serious in recent years. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  As the Embassy\'s Trafficking in Persons Reports </p><p>(ref a is for 2002) noted, women and girls trafficked abroad </p><p>from Vietnam go primarily to Cambodia and the PRC.  There is </p><p>also evidence that some Vietnamese citizens are trafficked </p><p>through Cambodia to third countries.  Nguyen Sy Tuan, Deputy </p><p>Director of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, </p><p>commented that, while the human trafficking problem is a </p><p>major issue, it has received "less bilateral attention" than </p><p>drugs.  He opined that, as international pressure increases </p><p>on the human trafficking issue, Vietnam and Cambodia\'s </p><p>leaders "will have to focus more on the human trafficking </p><p>issue." </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>MONTAGNARD ISSUE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  The IIR\'s Binh discounted the impact on the 2001 </p><p>exodus of about 1,000 Montagnards into Cambodia following </p><p>February/March 2001 demonstrations in the Central Highlands </p><p>and the 2002 collapse of the Cambodia/Vietnam/UNHCR </p><p>Tripartite Agreement as ongoing issues in bilateral ties. </p><p>People from the Central Highlands who crossed "illegally" </p><p>into Cambodia did so with the intent of reaching a third </p><p>country, he claimed.  Once the United Nations became </p><p>involved, the problem took on a "multilateral context," he </p><p>added.  He declined to comment on fresh reports of active </p><p>Cambodian police cooperation in returning additional 2002 </p><p>cases of would-be Montagnard escapees, which, according to </p><p>Vietnamese media accounts, led to multi-year prison </p><p>sentences for at least five Gia Lai residents on March 12. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>BORDER DEMARCATION:  SLOW GOING </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Notwithstanding periodic MFA announcements over </p><p>the past few years that the border issue will be settled </p><p>"this year," border demarcation remains unresolved. </p><p>According to the Southeast Asia Institute\'s Tuan, the </p><p>current border essentially represents the old French </p><p>colonial demarcation.  However, he noted that the border </p><p>"does not always agree with the current maps."  He added </p><p>that people who live and try to make a living near the </p><p>border "tend to move back and forth; border lines do not </p><p>mean much to them."  Even though "both governments warn </p><p>their people" against farming close to the border, such </p><p>activities continue to take place because of "the demand for </p><p>rice fields and access to water," he added. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Nguyen Du Hanh, Director of the Western Border </p><p>Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\' (MFA) Border </p><p>Commission, admitted separately that the border issue is </p><p>"complicated," but stated that both sides would like to </p><p>settle it.  He pointed out that, in the early 1980s, Vietnam </p><p>and Cambodia had signed "a number" of international </p><p>conventions concerning border demarcation.  In addition, </p><p>there was a bilateral agreement in 1985 that led to "some </p><p>demarcation activity" from 1986-1990.  Hanh noted that this </p><p>activity ceased with a change of governments in Cambodia </p><p>after the UN-sponsored elections.  However, Hanh claimed </p><p>that the two sides "are not far apart" - of the nearly 1,000- </p><p>kilometer border, "under 200 kilometers are in dispute."  At </p><p>the June 2002 joint border commission, both sides agreed to </p><p>"join hands" to solve the border issue, he noted.  Hanh </p><p>suggested that "in the end, the border will be based on the </p><p>French demarcation, with minor adjustments."  Commenting on </p><p>recent developments, Hanh stated that there have been talks </p><p>at the "expert" working level "once or twice a year." </p><p>However, progress has been "slow" because more senior </p><p>officials have been "busy" and because there is a lack of </p><p>"legal documents on which to base final negotiations." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  Separately, the Southeast Asia Institute\'s Tuan </p><p>noted that the border had become a "hot" issue in Cambodia\'s </p><p>politics.  (Note:  it has not become a hot issue in Vietnam, </p><p>unlike the more controversial land border agreement with the </p><p>PRC in 1999.  End note)  Tuan added that the opposition </p><p>parties have "severely" criticized the present government </p><p>for appearing "too willing" to make concessions to Vietnam. </p><p>He predicted that there would be no further progress until </p><p>after the Cambodian elections in July.  Further progress </p><p>will depend "to some extent on who is in power," he </p><p>predicted.  He claimed that an expected senior level meeting </p><p>to discuss seven outstanding border issues -- scheduled for </p><p>March 2003 -- had been postponed due to "domestic political </p><p>considerations" in Cambodia. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>TWO-WAY TRADE:  NOT MUCH </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  Without citing a specific figure, Hanh admitted </p><p>that two-way trade was "very low."   MFA press releases </p><p>concerning Vietnam-Cambodia relations between 2001 and 2003 </p><p>include numerous proclamations and pledges of "continued </p><p>support and cooperation" but almost none related </p><p>specifically to two-way trade.  The Cambodian Embassy\'s </p><p>Kemary suggested that there is some potential for improving </p><p>legal two-way trade, especially once the border issue is </p><p>settled and authorities on both sides take further steps to </p><p>reduce smuggling.  Kemary said that the Cambodian government </p><p>is "hopeful" about the potential for Cambodia "modestly" to </p><p>improve especially its exports of clothing and shoes to </p><p>Vietnam.  (Comment:  Since clothing and shoes are well- </p><p>developed domestic and export industries in Vietnam, this </p><p>would seem unlikely.  End Comment.)  Separately, the </p><p>Southeast Asia Institute\'s Tuan opined that improved two-way </p><p>trade is "unlikely until border and smuggling issues are </p><p>addressed and the Cambodian economy produces more." </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  In addition to trade, Kemary noted that Cambodia </p><p>"appreciates" Vietnam\'s rice assistance.  (Note:  According </p><p>to an October 2002 MFA announcement, the GVN donated 500 </p><p>tons of rice to Cambodia\'s Kandal province.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MIA COOPERATION </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  Tuan pointed to the MIA issue as one that </p><p>demonstrates a "good" level of bilateral cooperation.  He </p><p>said that Cambodia has been helpful in providing information </p><p>on Vietnamese remains.  According to the Detachment Two </p><p>Joint Task Force - Full Accounting office in Hanoi, </p><p>Vietnam\'s military has conducted dry-season recovery </p><p>operations in Cambodia over the past three years.  Each </p><p>year, the two sides meet, work out an operations plan, </p><p>deploy Vietnamese troops into agreed-upon areas, conduct </p><p>operations, and repatriate the remains to Vietnam.  An </p><p>August 2002 visit by GVN Defense Minister Senior Lieutenant </p><p>General Pham Van Tra also focused on this issue.  During </p><p>Prime Minister Hun Sen\'s trip to Ho Chi Minh City for the </p><p>2002 tripartite meeting, he visited the commander of </p><p>Vietnam\'s Military Zone 7 in Dong Nai (southern Vietnam). </p><p>Tuan opined that Hun Sen "may have" raised MIA cooperation </p><p>during that visit as well.  According to a January 2003 MFA </p><p>announcement, 2,344 sets of remains have been repatriated to </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  A mix of historical animosities, cultural </p><p>rivalries, and complex leadership relations stemming from </p><p>Vietnam\'s decade-long occupation and efforts to install its </p><p>own favorites in power in Phnom Penh complicate the </p><p>bilateral relationship.  Vietnamese now appear to put aside </p><p>the recent past and deal with Cambodia as just another </p><p>fellow ASEAN member and good neighbor, while still seeking </p><p>to dominate a mini-Indochina lobby within ASEAN seeking </p><p>extra help from richer members.  While Vietnam prefers to </p><p>look forward in its 21st century relations with Cambodia, </p><p>the likelihood is that Cambodia will be less and less </p><p>important to Vietnam, as it focuses on more important </p><p>economic and political relationships with the U.S., Japan, </p><p>and the EU and seeks WTO accession. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
