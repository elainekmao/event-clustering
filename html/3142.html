<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003249 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 6/16/12 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, JO, PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: THE CASE OF TOUJAN FAISAL:  SCRATCHING ONLY MAKES </p><p>IT WORSE </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2559 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM: REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY.  Imprisoned former Member of Parliament </p><p>Toujan Faisal continues to be a topic of discussion and </p><p>debate within various elements of Jordanian society. </p><p>Following her arrest and sentencing (reftel), the outspoken </p><p>and antagonistic former MP has reportedly gone on a hunger </p><p>strike in prison and claims to be suffering from breast </p><p>cancer (without access to proper medical treatment).  On June </p><p>11, a group including Faisal\'s attorney and human rights </p><p>activists held a press conference, at which they blamed the </p><p>GOJ for Faisal\'s incarceration and called for her immediate </p><p>release.  While there is scant domestic media attention to </p><p>this issue, it is a very hot topic of conversation among many </p><p>Jordanians, with the majority opining that Faisal is </p><p>imprisoned wrongfully and that her accusations of corruption </p><p>against GOJ officials definitely hit a nerve - and therefore </p><p>must be true to some degree.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>PRESS CONFERENCE CALLS FOR GOJ TO RELEASE FAISAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  On June 11, a group of human rights activists calling </p><p>themselves the "Popular Committee to Support Toujan Faisal" </p><p>held a press conference at the Jordanian Women\'s Federation </p><p>in Amman.  Attendees included local human rights advocates as </p><p>well as some from Egypt and Europe.   The committee issued a </p><p>statement calling for Faisal\'s immediate release.  In </p><p>addition, the statement condemned the GOJ\'s silence to their </p><p>repeated requests to release Faisal.  The statement also said </p><p>that the GOJ\'s handling of this case marks a deterioration of </p><p>democracy in Jordan and called for "canceling temporary laws </p><p>that prohibit freedoms and speech freedom". </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  One of the committee members, Fawzi Samhoury </p><p>(Protect), is a long-time embassy contact.  Samhoury told </p><p>POLOFF that the committee had sent a letter more than two </p><p>weeks ago to King Abdullah signed by approximately one </p><p>hundred people, requesting the release of Faisal.  The letter </p><p>has yet to receive a response.  As a result, the committee </p><p>moved forward with the press conference.  Samhoury noted that </p><p>there was scant media attention, which he attributed to a </p><p>\'boycott\' by the mainstream media.  Two local papers did </p><p>cover the conference (Arab Al-Yawm and Al-Sabil) with short </p><p>stories.  The articles allege that Faisal is ailing from </p><p>breast cancer, is on a hunger strike, and is being denied </p><p>access to appropriate medical treatment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>FAISAL\'S SITUATION RESONATING WITHIN JORDANIAN SOCIETY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Toujan Faisal has been a persistent topic of </p><p>conversation for many Jordanians.  Members of the young, </p><p>upper middle-class crowd (who seem most interested in reform) </p><p>routinely cite the Faisal case as evidence in their growing </p><p>belief that the GOJ is feckless in dealing with corruption. </p><p>Increasingly, Jordanians are focusing their blame for </p><p>Faisal\'s imprisonment away from the PM and other GOJ </p><p>officials and towards the King.  As the King is the only </p><p>person capable of releasing Faisal, the argument goes, he </p><p>must either pardon her or shoulder the blame for her </p><p>incarceration.  At a recent dinner with prominent Circassian </p><p>community leaders, the Ambassador was struck by the intensity </p><p>and duration of discussion concerning Faisal.  NOTE:  Faisal </p><p>is herself a member of the Jordanian Circassian community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  As reported in reftel, Faisal was a nearly forgotten </p><p>former MP until her sentencing and subsequent imprisonment. </p><p>While most Jordanians generally consider her nothing more </p><p>than an irritating political sidewinder, the State Security </p><p>Court\'s conviction and sentencing of Faisal has created a </p><p>level of sympathy for her that she otherwise would not enjoy. </p><p> In addition, her imprisonment encourages discussion her of </p><p>allegations of corruption.  Most Jordanians with a knowledge </p><p>of the case believe that the GOJ\'s rash action against Faisal </p><p>lends credence to her allegations.  Faisal\'s imprisonment is </p><p>likely to remain a thorn in the side of the GOJ as long as it </p><p>continues. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
