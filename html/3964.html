<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002833 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:DECL: 10/11/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, PREL, MOPS, MARR, PINS, CM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: IMPLEMENTING THE BAKASSI RULING, A </p><p>GON CLARRIFICATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABUJA 2813; B) BROWNE-FULLER 10/10/02 TELCOM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On October 10 MFA Permanent Secretary Dan Hart </p><p>phoned Ambassador to clarify a statement made during </p><p>their earlier October 7 meeting on Bakassi (Reftel A). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) At the earlier meeting, Hart stated the GON </p><p>wanted a "Joint Implementing Committee" with Cameroon </p><p>in order to manage the post-decision implementation </p><p>process.  Instead of a joint implementation committee </p><p>focused solely on the Bakassi, Hart said the GON would </p><p>rather create a "Reconciliation and Good </p><p>Neighborliness Committee."  According to Hart, the </p><p>committee would be all embracing.  While the ICJ </p><p>ruling and its implementation would be an important </p><p>part of its work, the Committee as envisioned by the </p><p>GON, would deal with all aspects of bilateral </p><p>relations, from consular matters to trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) As part of GON efforts to establish stronger </p><p>ties with Cameroon, there had been discussions within </p><p>the Abuja government about urging Cameroon to join </p><p>ECOWAS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Hart also said that Obasanjo would call </p><p>Cameroonian President Biya immediately after the </p><p>judgement was announced. We have no details yet about </p><p>the call. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: The GON is exploring ways to lessen </p><p>the sting of an adverse ICJ judgement. The obtusely </p><p>named Reconciliation Committee is one such approach. </p><p>By engaging the Cameroonians on other issues besides </p><p>their border dispute, the GON hopes the give and take </p><p>on these other fronts will spill over into discussions </p><p>about the ICJ decision.  Moreover, the more the GON </p><p>can focus Yaounde on the benefits of an enhanced </p><p>bilateral relationship, the less likely Yaounde may </p><p>push for swift implementation of the Bakassi ruling. </p><p>The GON wants to make it appear that the practical </p><p>effect of a "new" relationship with Cameroon trumps </p><p>the legal ruling and that the situation on the ground </p><p>will not undergo swift, radical change.  If the GON </p><p>can create this perception, they will be able to </p><p>better manage public opinion and internal GON hard- </p><p>liners that might want to fight in order to save the </p><p>land "stolen" by the ICJ. The big question for Nigeria </p><p>is whether Cameroon is willing to play. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
