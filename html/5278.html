<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HALIFAX 0010 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/CAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PGOV, ETRD, EWWT, CA, Ports, Trade, Transportation, Border Patrol </p><p>SUBJECT:  CANADIAN PORT SECURITY MEASURES ANNOUNCED IN HALIFAX </p><p> </p><p>REF:  02 HALIFAX 196 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Atlantic Canada and Halifax port </p><p>officials are satisfied that the Canadian government\'s port </p><p>security initiative, announced at a Halifax news conference by </p><p>four federal cabinet ministers on January 22, is a step in the </p><p>right direction.  Local officials welcomed the government\'s </p><p>C$172 million package but have questions about how much of that </p><p>money will end up at Halifax port.  Moreover, they insist that </p><p>local efforts to bolster security at this port, such as </p><p>tightening background checks on port employees and installing </p><p>high-tech screening systems for incoming marine containers, are </p><p>already accomplishing many of the objectives laid out in the </p><p>federal government\'s five-year plan.   They are skeptical that </p><p>the proposed package will take port security much farther than </p><p>where the ports are going themselves at their own initiative, </p><p>and they warn that some of the government\'s proposed measures </p><p>fail to focus on the main threat: the possibility of a nuclear </p><p>or chem-bio device hidden inside a shipping container entering </p><p>Halifax from overseas but destined for the United States.  (END </p><p>SUMMARY AND COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) At a press conference on the Halifax waterfront, four </p><p>federal cabinet ministers---Transport Minister David Collenette, </p><p>Solicitor General Wayne Easter, Fisheries Minister Robert </p><p>Thibault, and Customs/Revenue Minister Elinor Caplan---announced </p><p>the government\'s plan to spend C$172 over five years on new </p><p>computers, scanning equipment, training, and police and Customs </p><p>services to enhance security at the country\'s three major ports </p><p>of Halifax, Vancouver, and Montreal.  The government\'s plan, </p><p>according to Collenette, will result in increased surveillance </p><p>of marine traffic, more thorough screening passengers and crew, </p><p>installation of new detection equipment in ports to screen </p><p>shipping containers, improvement in the capacity of the RCMP to </p><p>investigate and respond to potential security breaches, </p><p>establishment of restricted port areas, and new requirements </p><p>that port workers undergo thorough background checks. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Officials of Halifax port and Canada Customs in </p><p>Atlantic Canada told CG that they welcome the government\'s </p><p>announcement but are waiting to see how Ottawa will divide up </p><p>the C$172 million.  They commented that the most acute need is </p><p>for money to cover the purchase and maintenance of the expensive </p><p>gamma-ray scanners known as VACIS (Vehicle and Cargo Inspection </p><p>System) and other new high-tech equipment.  Halifax Port Authority </p><p>officials noted wryly that the port has already been purchasing </p><p>and installing VACIS scanners, at considerable cost, over the </p><p>past six months with no help from Ottawa (SEE REFTEL).  Our </p><p>local contacts were somewhat dismayed that the visiting federal </p><p>ministers seemed unaware that, since the September 11 terrorist </p><p>attacks, Halifax port and Canada Customs here have been </p><p>implementing almost all of the measures laid out in the </p><p>government\'s five-year plan.  For example, Halifax has already </p><p>placed tighter controls on passengers and crew of visiting </p><p>ships, established restricted areas within the port, tightened </p><p>background checks for port employees, and made considerable </p><p>progress in reinforcing the identification and screening of </p><p>potentially suspect marine containers coming in to North America </p><p>through Halifax port.  These local initiatives, Halifax </p><p>officials feel, have received neither recognition nor support </p><p>from Ottawa. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The one substantial change contained in the federal </p><p>announcement, according to our contacts, is the decision to </p><p>augment the role of the RCMP in enforcing port security.  Until </p><p>now, the RCMP here in Halifax has had no personnel permanently </p><p>assigned at the port.   Canada Customs, with support from the </p><p>two U.S. Customs inspectors who have been seconded here since </p><p>last year, conducts all investigations and searches.    RCMP </p><p>Inspector Bill Kazmel, the federal policing chief for Nova </p><p>Scotia, told CG that the government\'s plan should enable his </p><p>office to assign at least four RCMP members to full-time duty at </p><p>the Halifax port.  Our local contacts also believe that the key </p><p>to success will be a determination on the part of the federal </p><p>government to ensure an equitable division of resources and </p><p>coordination among the six agencies that will have to work </p><p>together at the port: RCMP, Transport Canada, Canada Customs, </p><p>Citizenship and Immigration Canada, CSIS, and the Department of </p><p>Fisheries and Oceans. </p><p>6.  (SBU) A few local officials told CG they doubted that the </p><p>amount of money announced by the federal ministers will make a </p><p>difference, noting that C$172 million over five years amounts to </p><p>only C$34 million per year, and that sum has to be spread among </p><p>six agencies at three different ports. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Finally, our contacts warned that some of the </p><p>government\'s measures---those that focus on perimeter security </p><p>at the port facility itself and background checks for </p><p>longshoremen---were missing the point: the main security threat </p><p>at Halifax port does not emanate from local individuals coming </p><p>onto port property, but rather from shipping containers coming </p><p>in from overseas.  In light of the post-September 11 terrorism </p><p>dangers, port security efforts should not focus on protecting </p><p>foreign container ships from attack by local elements in </p><p>Halifax, which is unlikely, but instead should focus on </p><p>protecting North America from a potential hazard---such as a </p><p>nuclear or biological device---that might conceivably be hidden </p><p>inside a container coming from overseas.   Halifax handles more </p><p>than half a million incoming shipping containers every year, </p><p>approximately 100,000 of which are in transit for destinations </p><p>in the United States. </p><p>KASHKETT </p><p></p></div>
