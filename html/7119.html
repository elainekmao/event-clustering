THESE STORIES ALSO CARRIED </p><p>REMARKS OF THE AMBASSADOR, DELIVERED TO THE PRESS OUTSIDE THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTRY FOLLOWING THE MEETING, EXPRESSING THE U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S SHARED CONCERN FOR THE WELFARE OF CIVILIANS IN </p><p>IRAQ AND ADDING THAT THE COALITION WAS TAKING ALL POSSIBLE </p><p>MEASURES TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF THE FIGHTING ON THE </p><p>CIVILIAN POPULATION AND WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO EVEN AS WE </p><p>PURSUED THE OBJECTIVE OF REMOVING THE BAATHIST REGIME FROM </p><p>POWER.  THE AMBASSADOR IS ALSO QUOTED, IN RESPONSE TO A </p><p>QUESTION ABOUT THE STATE OF U.S.-JORDANIAN RELATIONS, AS </p><p>SAYING THAT U.S.-JORDANIAN RELATIONS REMAIN EXTREMELY CLOSE </p><p>ON A VARIETY OF LEVELS, AND THAT WHILE DISAGREEMENTS MAY </p><p>OCCUR, THE TWO NATIONS SHARE A COMMON CONCERN FOR THE WELFARE </p><p>OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND WILL WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>THEIR HUMANITARIAN NEEDS ARE MET. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) EDITORIALS IN JORDAN\'S TWO LEADING ARABIC DAILIES (AL </p><p>RA\'I AND AL DUSTOOR, GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED AND INFLUENCED, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY) FOCUSED ON THE MEETING AS EVIDENCE THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS IMPLEMENTING THE VIEWS OF THE KING IN </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE WAR AS EXPRESSED A DAY EARLIER IN AN </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH THE STATE-RUN NEWS AGENCY, PETRA.  UNDER THE </p><p>TITLE, "JORDAN BETWEEN STANCE AND ACTION", AL DUSTOOR\'S APRIL </p><p>4 EDITORIAL READS: "TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AFTER THE CLEAR </p><p>DENUNCIATION OF THE AMERICAN AND BRITISH INVASION OF IRAQ, AS </p><p>EXPRESSED BY HM ABDULLAH THE SECOND, COMES THE SUMMONING BY </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR, A PRACTICAL </p><p>STEP THAT TRANSLATES THE NATIONALIST, PAN-ARAB AND </p><p>HUMANITARIAN POSITION OF JORDAN TOWARD BROTHERLY IRAQ, (AND </p><p>THIS) DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND </p><p>THE SENSITIVITY OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE COUNTRY THAT HAS </p><p>SET DANGEROUS TERMS FOR ITS RELATIONS WITH OTHER STATES BASED </p><p>ON THE PRINCIPLE \'YOU ARE EITHER WITH US OR AGAINST US.\'" </p><p>AND LATER, "THE KING\'S REMARKS...HAVE SHOWN THE COURAGE OF A </p><p>LEADER SPEAKING THE TRUTH...SUMMONING THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>STRONGLY PROTEST THE KILLING OF IRAQI CIVILIANS...IS, IN </p><p>REALITY, THE FIRST POLITICAL MEASURE THAT AN ARAB COUNTRY </p><p>DARES TO ADOPT, AND MAY EVEN BE THE FIRST GENUINE STAND </p><p>ADOPTED BY A COUNTRY AT THE LEVEL OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY.  THIS POSITION IS NOT MERE RHETORIC AIMED AT </p><p>AVOIDING ACTUAL DUTIES."  GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED AL-RA\'I </p><p>ECHOED THIS LINE IN ITS EDITORIAL, AND ADDED A FEW BARBS FOR </p><p>THOSE WHO SIGNED THE "LETTER OF THE 99":  "THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER\'S SUMMONING OF THE U.S. AMBASSADOR IN AMMAN TO </p><p>CONVEY TO HIM THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE\'S DENUNCIATION...IS </p><p>IN ITSELF A DUAL MESSAGE THAT MUST BE READ CAREFULLY BY ALL </p><p>THOSE CONCERNED.  THE DENUNCIATION OF THE KILLING OF </p><p>CIVILIANS IS MADE DIRECTLY TO THE AMBASSADOR WHOSE COUNTRY IS </p><p>INVOLVED IN THE WAR AND WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO PROTECT INNOCENT </p><p>CIVILIANS IN LINE WITH GENEVA CONVENTIONS.  ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, IT IS A MESSAGE TO THOSE WHO ARE FILLING THE AIR WITH </p><p>NOISE AND MEDIA STATEMENTS THAT HAVE NO VALUE OR WORTH ON THE </p><p>GROUND." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (C) THE GOVERMENT PLAYED OUT THIS THREE-ACT PERFORMANCE IN </p><p>ORDER TO ALIGN MORE CLOSELY ITS PUBLIC STANCE WITH THE ANGER </p><p>AND DISSATISFACTION OF THE PEOPLE, AND AS A RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>LETTER CHALLENGING ITS POSITIONS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC </p><p>EARLIER IN THE WEEK (REF B).  WHETHER ALL THIS WILL DO THE </p><p>TRICK REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  MIXED IN WITH THIS ANGER AND </p><p>DISSATISFACTION IS A DEEP SKEPTICISM AMONG JORDANIANS ABOUT </p><p>GOVERNMENT DECLARATIONS, PARTICULARLY AS MORE AND MORE </p><p>JORDANIANS ARE CONVINCED THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT HAS ASSISTED </p><p>THE U.S. IN THE WAR.  THE EXERCISE PLAYED OUT OVER THE COURSE </p><p>OF THIS WEEK POINTS TO A FUTURE OF CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGE TO </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT WHEN THE WAR CONCLUDES AND THE PEOPLE TAKE </p><p>STOCK OF THEIR GOVERNMENT\'S TRUE ROLE IN IT. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
