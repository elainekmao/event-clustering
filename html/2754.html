<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 000876 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, KJUS, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON LAURENT KABILA ASSASSINATION TRIAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: KINSHASA 793 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF LAURA ENGELBRECHT, REASONS 1.5 B & D </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE LAURENT KABILA ASSASSINATION TRIAL BEFORE </p><p>A MILITARY TRIBUNAL BEGAN APRIL 3 IN A PUBLIC COURTROOM. </p><p>CURRENTLY, THE WITNESSES AND SOME DEFENDANTS (SUCH AS EDDY </p><p>KAPEND, FORMER AIDE-DE-CAMP TO KABILA AND ALLEGED </p><p>COUP-PLOTTER) ARE TESTIFYING ON THEIR ROLES IN THE EVENTS </p><p>IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING THE ASSASSINATION.  SEVERAL </p><p>CONTRADICTORY VERSIONS HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH, AND THE COURT </p><p>WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO HEAR TESTIMONY FOR QUITE SOME TIME. </p><p>NOW THAT THE TRIAL HAS STARTED, THERE IS AT LEAST A SEMBLANCE </p><p>OF ORDER AND DUE PROCESS, A WELCOME CHANGE FROM THE LONG </p><p>IMPRISONMENT OF THE ACCUSED WITHOUT CHARGES OR LAWYERS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POLOFF ATTENDED TWO SESSIONS OF THE ONGOING TRIAL FOR </p><p>THE 116 DEFENDANTS IN THE LDK ASSASSINATION.  THE TRIAL IS </p><p>BEING HELD AT MAKALA CENTRAL PRISON, AND BY PREVAILING LOCAL </p><p>STANDARDS, IT IS QUITE WELL ORGANIZED AND ACCESSIBLE TO THE </p><p>PUBLIC.  THE COURTROOM INCLUDES A RAISED PLATFORM FOR THE </p><p>MILITARY JUDGES, A TABLE FACING IT FOR WITNESSES AND LAWYERS, </p><p>A SEATING SECTION FOR THE DEFENDANTS (LOOKS LIKE A JURY BOX), </p><p>AND ROWS OF SEATING FOR THE LAWYERS (OVER 100).  THE PUBLIC </p><p>(MAINLY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OF THE DEFENDANTS) IS SEATED IN </p><p>AN ADJOINING COURTYARD UNDER A SHADE SHELTER.  ALL JUDGES, </p><p>LAWYERS, AND WITNESSES USE MICROPHONES, AND THE TRIAL CAN BE </p><p>CLEARLY HEARD BY ALL.  MANY OF THE OTHER MAKALA PRISONERS </p><p>HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO COME AND WATCH THE TRIAL.  MILITARY AND </p><p>POLICE PRESENCE (INCLUDING ZIMBABWEAN SOLDIERS) IS HEAVY BUT </p><p>NOT MENACING.  THERE IS A RELAXED ATMOSPHERE DURING THE COURT </p><p>RECESSES - EVERYONE (THE LAWYERS, JUDGES, MILITARY, MAKALA </p><p>PRISONERS, AND EVEN THE DEFENDANTS IN THE TRIAL) STAND AROUND </p><p>CHATTING TOGETHER IN THE COURTYARD, WHERE VENDORS HAWK DRINKS </p><p>AND SANDWICHES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DAILY PROGRESSION </p><p>OF THE TRIAL: </p><p> </p><p>APRIL 3: THE COURT CONSIDERED TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND </p><p>OBJECTIONS TO PROCEDURE RAISED BY THE DEFENSE LAWYERS. </p><p> </p><p>APRIL 4-5: THE COURT MOVED IMMEDIATELY TO HEARING TESTIMONY </p><p>ABOUT THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE ASSASSINATION.  SEVERAL </p><p>DEFENDANTS (KAPEND AND THREE MILITARY GUARDS) TESTIFIED, AS </p><p>DID FORMER FINANCE ADVISOR MOTA, WHO WAS WITH THE PRESIDENT </p><p>AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION.  THEIR VERSIONS OF EVENTS </p><p>DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY.  KAPEND HAS DENIED THAT HE KILLED THE </p><p>ASSASSIN RASHIDI, SAYING RASHIDI COMMITTED SUICIDE AND KAPEND </p><p>EMPTIED HIS GUN INTO HIM "OUT OF ANGER" AFTER HE WAS ALREADY </p><p>DEAD.  MOTA CLAIMS HE SAW NO HUMAN BEINGS IN THE COMPOUND </p><p>RIGHT AFTER THE SHOOTING, ONLY A COW.  CHIRIBAGULA, ONE OF </p><p>THE GUARDS, CLAIMS MOTA NOT ONLY SAW HIM, BUT SPOKE TO HIM </p><p>("AND I AM NOT A COW").  MOTA, WHO WAS IN COURT MERELY AS A </p><p>WITNESS, HAS NOW BEEN DETAINED FOR THE DURATION OF THE TRIAL </p><p>ON THE GROUNDS OF SELF-CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY (PROBABLY TO </p><p>PREVENT HIM FROM FLEEING).  (NOTE: MOTA\'S COW STORY MAY HAVE </p><p>BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO IMPLY THAT THERE WAS SORCERY INVOLVED, AS </p><p>SOME CONGOLESE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE CAN TURN THEMSELVES INTO </p><p>ANIMALS THROUGH MAGIC.) </p><p> </p><p>APRIL 8: THE COURT MOVED TEMPORARILY TO THE PALAIS DE MARBRE, </p><p>THE SITE OF THE ASSASSINATION, TO ALLOW THE WITNESSES TO </p><p>REENACT THE EVENTS. </p><p> </p><p>APRIL 9-10: MORE TESTIMONY WAS HEARD.  THE DRIVER OF GEORGES </p><p>MIRINDI (AN ALLEGED CONSPIRATOR IN THE PLOT) TESTIFIED THAT </p><p>ON THE DAY BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION, HE WARNED LAURENT </p><p>KABILA\'S DRIVER OF THE PLOT AND TOLD KABILA\'S DRIVER TO </p><p>INFORM THE HIERARCHY.  KABILA\'S DRIVER TESTIFIED THAT HE </p><p>INFORMED THE SECURITY SERVICES.  THE TWO SECURITY SERVICES </p><p>OFFICERS SAID THEY HAD HAD NO TRANSPORTATION TO GO ARREST </p><p>MIRINDI.  THEIR BOSS TESTIFIED THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN TOLD. </p><p> </p><p>APRIL 11: GAETAN KAKUDJI, LAURENT KABILA\'S FORMER MINISTER OF </p><p>INTERIOR AND CLOSE ADVISOR, TESTIFIED ABOUT HIS AND OTHER </p><p>SENIOR ADVISORS\' (INCLUDING MWENZE KONGOLO) ACTIONS </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SHOOTING.  HE TALKED ABOUT A MEETING TO </p><p>DISCUSS PLACING JOSEPH KABILA IN THE PRESIDENCY TO KEEP </p><p>THINGS STABLE, AND HE STRESSED THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO CARRY </p><p>OUT LDK\'S WISHES.  HE CONTRADICTED AND CORRECTED HIMSELF ON </p><p>OCCASION DURING HIS TESTIMONY, AND HIS ATTEMPTS AT HUMOR </p><p>BORDERED AT TIMES ON IMPUDENCE IN ADDRESSING THE JUDGE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  EVEN BEFORE THE TRIAL BEGAN, IT HAD SEVERE DUE </p><p>PROCESS PROBLEMS, SUCH AS THE YEAR-LONG JAILING OF DEFENDANTS </p><p>WITHOUT LAWYERS OR CHARGES, THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME GIVEN TO </p><p>PREPARE THE DEFENSE, THE TRIAL OF SO MANY DEFENDANTS ON </p><p>WIDELY VARYING CHARGES IN A SINGLE TRIAL, AND THE TRIAL OF </p><p>CIVILIANS IN A MILITARY COURT.  NEVERTHELESS, NOW THAT IT HAS </p><p>BEGUN, THE TRIAL SEEMS TO BE PROCEEDING MORE-OR-LESS SMOOTHLY </p><p>AND OPENLY, WITH BOTH THE PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE HAVING </p><p>ADEQUATE TIME TO CROSS-EXAMINE THE WITNESSES.  MANY ASPECTS </p><p>OF THE PROCEDURE LOOK STRANGE TO U.S. OBSERVORS (SUCH AS </p><p>REQUIRING DEFENDANTS TO TESTIFY, THE ORDER OF WITNESSES, </p><p>ETC...), BUT THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE DRC </p><p>MILITARY COURT (COM) CODE IS BASED ON THE 1960\'S BELGIAN </p><p>PENAL CODE AND IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM TRIAL FORMAT USED IN </p><p>U.S. CIVILIAN COURTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) BOTH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS </p><p>(ICRC) AND THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW GROUP HAVE </p><p>MONITORS IN REGULAR ATTENDANCE AT THE TRIAL.  EACH DAY\'S </p><p>PROCEEDINGS ARE ALSO COVERED EXTENSIVELY IN THE LOCAL PRESS </p><p>AND, AS DEVELOPMENTS WARRANT, BY INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWAN </p><p></p></div>
