<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000996 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH OPPOSITION LEADER </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 995 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In a May 23 meeting with Ambassador Malinowski and </p><p>British Charge Mitchell, Opposition Leader and General </p><p>Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Leninist (UML)  Madhav Nepal said that he is is prepared to </p><p>go along with the dissolution of Parliament and to </p><p>participate in fresh elections called for November 13.  He </p><p>issued a caveat, however, that he would first have to get </p><p>approval from the party. While expressing some concern that </p><p>the move might be manipulated by "old forces," i.e., the </p><p>Palace, to reassert its interests, Nepal blamed former Prime </p><p>Minister G.P. Koirala for provoking a confrontation with </p><p>current Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba which, in Nepal\'s </p><p>words, left Deuba no other alternative but to dissolve </p><p>Parliament or to tender his resignation.  After some </p><p>hesitation, Nepal did not rule out the possibility of UML </p><p>participation in an interim Cabinet.  The Ambassador and his </p><p>British counterpart stressed the need for political maturity </p><p>at this critical juncture and advised Nepal that their two </p><p>governments will watch developments--and the behavior of </p><p>parties and individual political leaders--closely.  This </p><p>crisis presents a crucial opportunity to restore good </p><p>governance, better counter the Maoists, and eliminate </p><p>corruption.  Despite his generally positive comments, we </p><p>expect Nepal will wait to see which way political winds are </p><p>blowing before making any public commitments.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>THE VIEW FROM THE UML </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  On May 23 Ambassador Malinowski, accompanied by </p><p>British CDA Andrew Mitchell, called on Communist Party of </p><p>Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML) General Secretary and </p><p>Leader of the Opposition Madhav Kumar Nepal to glean his </p><p>reaction to the surprise May 22 dissolution of Parliament and </p><p>call for fresh elections November 13 (septel).  Nepal </p><p>squarely blamed former Prime Minister and ruling Nepali </p><p>Congress Party President Girija Prasad Koirala for provoking </p><p>a confrontation with Deuba over extension of the emergency in </p><p>the party\'s Central Working Committee (CWC) meeting (Reftel). </p><p> Koirala\'s sole motivation in the entire matter, Nepal </p><p>asserted, was his desire to return to power.  Nepal </p><p>complained that Koirala is ever ready to sacrifice the </p><p>national good for personal ambition and gain.  Venting on the </p><p>former PM, Nepal described him as the most corrupt person in </p><p>the country  and as one whose word could not be trusted. </p><p>After corraling support in the CWC, Koirala was moving so </p><p>aggressively against the PM among the party MPs that Deuba </p><p>was left with only two alternatives:  resign or dissolve </p><p>Parliament.  Deuba was only doing what he had to do, Nepal </p><p>observed, describing the move as constitutional.  The UML is </p><p>prepared to accept the decision and to participate in </p><p>elections in six months.  (He issued a caveat, however, that </p><p>he would first have to get approval from the party.)  That </p><p>said, however, he expressed some concern that the dissolution </p><p>of Parliament not be manipulated by "old forces," i.e., the </p><p>Palace, to regain some of the power lost since the </p><p>restoration of democracy in 1990.  Elections must be free and </p><p>fair, he emphasized.  He did not speculate about whether the </p><p>security situation will affect the ability to conduct such </p><p>elections beyond noting that his party would accept the </p><p>results of a free and fair election with no more than 30 </p><p>percent voter turnout. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Both the Ambassador and the British Charge noted the </p><p>intrinsically undemocratic nature of the CWC action the </p><p>previous day.  How can a political party, whose leadership is </p><p>elected only by its members, force a decision on the </p><p>government, which is elected by all voting citizens of Nepal? </p><p> The Opposition Leader--himself a party leader--initially </p><p>responded with arguments in favor of the primacy of the </p><p>party, but eventually began to see the logic of the point of </p><p>the two envoys. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>UML IN INTERIM CABINET? </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) If Deuba appoints a new Cabinet, the Ambassador </p><p>asked, would the UML participate?  The current crisis also </p><p>presents an opportunity for political leaders to do exactly </p><p>what they always talk about doing--better combating the </p><p>Maoist insurgency, tackling corruption and instituting good </p><p>governance.  A smaller, multi-partisan "blue-ribbon" interim </p><p>Cabinet might be just the way to do it, he pointed out. </p><p>Nepal initially expressed some ambivalence about the </p><p>prospect, stating that, if asked, he would first have to </p><p>consult the party Central Committee.  The Ambassador and the </p><p>British CDA both emphasized that as long-standing friends of </p><p>Nepal, their governments are frustrated by the lack of </p><p>political maturity so apparent in Kathmandu.  Their </p><p>governments hope to be helpful, but at the same time have a </p><p>responsibility to their taxpayers to ensure that aid is well </p><p>spent, and have taken serious note of statements by Koirala </p><p>himself, as well as others (including the Opposition Leader), </p><p>that Nepal does not need foreign assistance to counter the </p><p>insurgency.  While acknowledging that such statements are </p><p>often made for domestic political advantage, both envoys </p><p>noted that their governments could use assistance given to </p><p>Nepal in other places, if future Nepali governments and Prime </p><p>Ministers (including Madhav Nepal) did not want the </p><p>assistance. The time to sacrifice petty partisan interest for </p><p>the greater national good is now, they stressed; their </p><p>governments would be looking for signs of such commitment. </p><p>The Opposition Leader--who has himself made recent public </p><p>statements asserting national sovereignty and discounting the </p><p>need for foreign aid--took the hints on board.  While </p><p>reiterating the need for prior party consultation, he no </p><p>longer as readily dismissed the possibility of working in an </p><p>interim Cabinet. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The UML leader has good reason to be amenable to new </p><p>elections and even the possibility of serving in an interim </p><p>Cabinet if asked.  The Opposition is the only likely </p><p>beneficiary of the internecine warfare now raging within the </p><p>majority party.  If Deuba and his Cabinet are expelled from </p><p>the Nepali Congress--and that remains a distinct </p><p>possibility--the largest and oldest Nepali party could </p><p>disintegrate into rival factions, clearing the way for the </p><p>UML (newly bolstered by its reunion with the ML in February) </p><p>in the next elections.  But Madhav Nepal is too seasoned a </p><p>politician--and has been too long in the Opposition--to tip </p><p>his hand yet.  We expect he will wait to see which way the </p><p>political wind is blowing before deciding how his party can </p><p>best capitalize on this new situation. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
