<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000805 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ANPP CHAIRMAN SAYS PARTY WILL SEEK </p><p>REDRESS  THROUGH TRIBUNALS </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) During an April 30 meeting with DCM, All Nigerian </p><p>People\'s Party (ANPP) Chairman Chief Don Etiebet expressed </p><p>anger with ruling People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) </p><p>manipulation of the recent Presidential, Gubernatorial and </p><p>National Assembly elections.  Citing numerous examples of </p><p>PDP misconduct, Etiebet said the recent elections did not </p><p>reflect the will of the people.  Etiebet warned that while </p><p>Nigerians now only feel despair, that despair might turn to </p><p>anger should the electoral flaws not be redressed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Despite talk of "mass action" by some ANPP members, </p><p>including Presidential candidate Buhari, Etiebet said the </p><p>electoral tribunals would be his party\'s venue of choice </p><p>for airing grievances and that the ANPP would abide by </p><p>tribunal decisions.  While not optimistic, Etiebet hoped </p><p>the tribunals would reject elections in the areas of the </p><p>worst misconduct.  He also hoped that focusing attention on </p><p>the problems with these elections would avert similar </p><p>difficulties in the upcoming State Assembly and Local </p><p>Government elections.  Again, though not optimistic, </p><p>Etiebet expressed hope that vigorous investigation and </p><p>assessment of April\'s election would pave the way for freer </p><p>and fairer elections in 2007. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
