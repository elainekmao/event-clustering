<p>S E C R E T STATE 237921 </p><p> </p><p>ALMATY FOR AMBASSADOR JONES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/13/06 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PREL, KZ, PTER, KNNP </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:   ALMATY 008329 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.    (U)  CLASSIFIED BY INR TOM FINGAR, DAS/AN.   REASON </p><p>1.5(C) (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.    (S)  AS REOUESTED BY AMEMBASSY ALMATY,  INR PROVIDES </p><p>THE FOLLOWING BACKGROUND INFORMATION/TALKING POINTS ON </p><p>IRAN TO BE SHARED WITH DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER GIZZATOV </p><p>AND SENIOR KAZAK OFFICIALS.    WE HOPE THIS MATERIAL GIVES </p><p>ENOUGH DETAIL TO MAKE CLEAR THAT U.S. CONCERNS REGARDING </p><p>IRAN ARE WELL-FOUNDED.    THIS CABLE IS BEING SHARED WITH </p><p>OTH~R POSTS IN THE REGION FOR GENERAL INTEREST AND </p><p>INFORMATION.    THE FOLLOWING TEXT IS CLASSIFIED SECRET, </p><p>RELEASABLE TO SENIOR HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AS DEEMED </p><p>APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> ----------------------TEAR LINE------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>IRAN:   INTERNAL DEVELOPNENTS </p><p> </p><p>3.    (S)  ELECTIONS.  THE SECOND ROUND OF VOTING FOR THE </p><p>FIFTH NAJLIS IN APRIL SAW THE DEFEAT OF PRESIDENT </p><p>RAFSANJANI\'S FACTION; THE CONSERVATIVES REASSERTED SOME </p><p>MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER THE NAJLIS, ALTHOUGH BY A </p><p>NARROWER MAJORITY, WITH NATEG-NURI RE-ELECTED AS SPEAKER. </p><p>SUBSEQUENT SPECULATION ABOUT MODIFYING THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>TO ALLOW RAFSANJANI TO RUN A THIRD TERM WAS EFFECTIVELY </p><p>SUPPRESSED WITH SUPREME LEADER KHAMENEI\'S PUBLIC </p><p>PRONOUNCEMENT THAT ANOTHER SUITABLE POST WOULD BE FOUND </p><p>FOR RAFSANJANI.   NATEQ-NURI, BENEFITTING FROM A RECENT </p><p>RESURGENCE OF CLERICAL FORCES, HAS EMERGED AS THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL FRONTRUNNER. </p><p> </p><p>--    THERE IS LITTLE TO SUGGEST THAT ANY MAJOR FACTION </p><p>WITHIN THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT COULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS </p><p>"MODERATE" WITH REGARD TO SUCH ISSUES AS TERRORISM, HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS, OPPOSITION TO THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS, OR </p><p>PURSUIT OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>--    FOR THAT REASON, WE ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE UPCOMING </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,  REGARDLESS OF VICTOR, WILL RESULT </p><p>IN IRANIAN POLICIES THAT WOULD LEAD TOWARD RESPECT OF </p><p>OTHER NATIONS.   INDEED, UNDER NATEQ-NURI, IRAN COULD </p><p>REGRESS IN SOME AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>4.    (S)  HUMAN RIGHTS.  TEHRAN\'S MANIPULATION OF THE </p><p>ELECTION PROCESS TO ELIMINATE ROUGHLY 40 PERCENT OF </p><p>PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES TO THE NAJLIS SUSTAINED THE </p><p>DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT SEGMENTS OF THE VOTING </p><p>POPULATION, AND MEDIA CENSORSHIP, HARASSMENT OF ACADEMIC </p><p>FIGURES, AND PERSECUTION OF RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES-- </p><p>PARTICULARLY BAHA\'IS--ARE MATTERS OF PUBLIC RECORD.  LESS </p><p>WELL-KNOWN ARE IRANIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES INCLUDING </p><p>SUMMARY EXECUTIONS, TORTURE AND INHUMAN PUNISHMENTS, </p><p>ARBITRARY ARRESTS, AND UNEXPLAINED DISAPPEARANCES.  THE </p><p>UN SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAN HAS </p><p>JUST ISSUED HIS REPORT; IRAN HAS ALREADY BEGUN A </p><p>PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT THAT REPORT AND ITS </p><p>AUTHOR. </p><p> </p><p>EXTERNAL RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p>5.    (S)  DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN.  TEHRAN RECENTLY HAS </p><p>BLITZED THE ENTIRE REGION WITH WIDELY PUBLICIZED VISITS </p><p>BY PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT,  IN PARTICULAR </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT HABIBI, FOREIGN MINISTER VELAYATI, AND </p><p>DEPUTY FOREIGN NINISTER VAEZI, TO EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE, </p><p>CREATE OPENINGS, AND ENGENDER TIES WITH ITS NEIGHBORS BY </p><p>PROMOTING CULTURAL EXCHANGES AND PROMISING ECONOMIC AND </p><p>TRADE BENEFITS.   SIMILAR EFFORTS HAVE RANGED BEYOND THE </p><p>REGION TO EUROPE, RUSSIA, AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA, AND THE </p><p>FAR EAST AS IRAN TRIES TO PORTRAY ITSELF AS AN EMERGING </p><p>WORLD POWER. </p><p> </p><p>--    IN OFFICIAL FRIDAY SERMONS AND SPEECHES BY ITS </p><p>HIGHEST LEADERS, TEHRAN CONTINUALLY STRESSES THE </p><p>CONVICTION THAT IRAN HOLDS MORAL TITLE TO SPIRITUAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND MUST SPREAD ITS </p><p>VERSION OF ISLAMIC "REVOLUTION." </p><p> </p><p>6.    (S)  REGIONAL ENTANGLEMENTS.  TEHRAN CONTINUES TO </p><p>INVOLVE ITSELF IN SEVERAL REGIONAL CONFLICTS.   IN </p><p>NORTHERN IRAQ,  IRAN\'S JULY CROSS-BORDER MILITARY </p><p>EXPEDITION AGAINST THE KURDISH DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF IRAN </p><p>(KDP-I) AND SUBSEQUENT HEAVY MILITARY SUPPORT OF ONE </p><p>KURDISH FACTION GAVE BAGHDAD AN EXCUSE TO REENTER THE </p><p>NORTH AND ONCE AGAIN THREATEN THE KURDS.   IN AFGHANISTAN, </p><p>IRAN HAS PUBLICLY PROFESSED SUPPORT OF A PEACEFUL </p><p>SOLUTION UNDER A BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT AND THE UN </p><p>SPECIAL MISSION, BUT HAS SECRETLY PROVIDED ARMS AND </p><p>PROMOTED AN ANTI-TALEBAN COALITION.   IN TAJIKISTAN, </p><p>TEHRAN CLAIMS THE ROLE OF PEACE BROKER WHILE SUPPORTING </p><p>THE OPPOSITION.   IN THE GULF, IRAN HAS HELPED FOMENT </p><p>GREATER UNREST, RECRUITING AND TRAINING DISSIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>7.    (S)  TOOL OF STATECRAFT.  SINCE THE CLERICS CAME TO </p><p>POWER,  IRAN AND ITS SURROGATES HAVE CONDUCTED </p><p>KIDNAPPINGS, ASSASSINATIONS, AND BOMBINGS;  IRAN HAS ALSO </p><p>PROVIDED CRITICAL TRAINING, FINANCING, AND ARMS TO GROUPS </p><p>ENGAGED IN INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE FOR POLITICAL GOALS. </p><p>THESE ACTIVITIES ARE NEITHER ABERRATIONS NOR EXCEPTIONS, </p><p>BUT ARE CONDUCTED WITH FULL APPROVAL BY THE MOST SENIOR </p><p>LEVELS OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT, WHO CONSIDER THEM TO BE </p><p>LEGITIMATE TOOLS OF STATE POLICY.   THE NINISTRY OF </p><p>INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY (NOIS) HAS PRIMARY </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR IRAN\'S TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, WHILE THE </p><p>NINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>GUARDS ALSO PLAY ROLES.   TERRORIST ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED </p><p>OR SUPPORTED BY THESE AGENCIES ARE AUTHORIZED BY IRAN\'S </p><p>SUPREME COUNCIL FOR NATIONAL SECURITY, WHOSE MEMBERSHIP </p><p>INCLUDES PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI, SUPREME LEADER KHAMENEI, </p><p>NINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS VELAYATI, MINISTER OF </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ALL FALLAHIAN, AND MINISTER OF JUSTICE </p><p>YAZDI.   UNTIL THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY EXACTS A </p><p>SUFFICIENTLY HIGH ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PRICE, IRAN WILL </p><p>HAVE NO REASON TO CHANGE THIS BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>8.    (S)  MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS.  THE MOST VIVID </p><p>EXAMPLE OF IRANIAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM HAS BEEN AGAINST </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS.   IRAN\'S SUPPORT OF GROUPS </p><p>LIKE THE PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD (PIJ), LEBANESE </p><p>HIZBALLAH, THE PFLP-GC, HAMAS, AND SMALLER GROUPS </p><p>INCLUDES MONEY (EXCEEDING USDOLS 100 MILLION ANNUALLY), </p><p>ARMS, TRAINING, AND COORDINATION.   THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT </p><p>OF THE KILLINGS COMMITTED BY GROUPS SUPPORTED BY IRAN </p><p>PLACES A SERIOUS BURDEN ON THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>9.    (S)  THREATS TO STATE STABILITY.  IRAN IS A PATRON </p><p>OF OTHER POLITICAL OPPOSITION GROUPS THAT EMPLOY </p><p>VIOLENCE.   THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SUPPORT IS TO UNDERMINE </p><p>SECULAR GOVERNMENTS AND ENCOURAGE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF </p><p>REGIMES THAT WOULD BE MORE AMENABLE TO IRANIAN AND </p><p>POLITICIZED ISLAMIC INFLUENCE.   IRAN ALSO SEEKS TO GAIN A </p><p>FOOTHOLD IN ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS ON SEVERAL CONTINENTS AND </p><p>THEREBY FOSTER ITS IDEOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP.  MANY OF </p><p>IRAN\'S CONTACTS WITH OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS TAKE PLACE </p><p>IN THE SUDAN, SYRIA, AND LEBANON, ALTHOUGH MEMBERS OF </p><p>THESE GROUPS ALSO TRAVEL TO IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>--    EGYPT:  IRAN HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF PROVIDING SUPPORT </p><p>TO AL-GAMA\'AT AL-ISLAMIYAH, OR THE ISLAMIC GROUP, AND THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD.   EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC MILITANTS HAVE </p><p>BEEN REPORTED TO TRAVEL TO IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>--    ALGERIA:  IRAN HAS ALSO PROVIDED FUNDS TO THE </p><p>ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT (FIS) AND IS REPORTED TO HAVE </p><p>SHIPPED ARMS TO THE FIS VIA SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p>--    TURKEY:  IRAN FINANCIALLY SUPPORTS A MILITANT </p><p>ORGANIZATION SOMETIMES CALLED THE "ISLAMIC MOVEMENT," </p><p>WHICH HAS TARGETED TURKISH SECULARISTS AND WESTERNERS. </p><p>IRAN ALSO PROVIDES SAFE HAVEN TO THE TERRORIST KURDISTAN </p><p>WORKERS\' PARTY (PKK). </p><p> </p><p>--    TAJIKISTAN:  IRAN HAS PROVIDED TRAINING, FUNDING, </p><p>AND SAFE HAVEN TO THE ISLAMIC REVIVAL MOVEMENT OF </p><p>TAJIKISTAN (IRMT), NOW UNDER THE UNITED TAJIKISTAN </p><p>OPPOSITION (UTO), DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND THE ONGOING </p><p>INSURGENCY.   THE IRANIAN EMBASSY IN DUSHANBE HAS </p><p>CONDUCTED ESPIONAGE AND RECRUITING ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>--    CENTRAL ASIA:  IRAN HAS SOUGHT TO EXPLOIT WEAKNESSES </p><p>AND VULNERABILITIES IN TAJIKISTAN AND ELSEWHERE IN </p><p>CENTRAL ASIA, SENDING RELIGIOUS PROSELYTIZERS AND FUNDING </p><p>POLITICAL ISLAMIC GROUPS.   GETTING AT THE REGION\'S </p><p>URANIUM RESOURCES AND EXERTING INFLUENCE OVER ITS ENERGY </p><p>SUPPLIES HAVE BEEN KEEN OBJECTIVES. </p><p> </p><p>10.   (S)  THREATS TO INTERNATIONAL LAW.  TEHRAN HAS LONG </p><p>WAGED A VIOLENT STRUGGLE WITH SEVERAL IRANIAN OPPOSITION- </p><p>GROUPS, CHIEF AMONG THEM THE NOJAHEDIN-E KHALQ (~ZK) AND </p><p>THE KURDISH DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF IRAN (KDP-I).  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS USED TERRORISM AGAINST THEM, AS WELL AS </p><p>AGAINST NON-VIOLENT OPPOSITION GROUPS, AT HOME AND ABROAD </p><p>WITHOUT REGARD FOR BORDERS OR JUDICIAL SYSTEMS. </p><p> </p><p>--    MOJAHEDIN-E KHALQ:  THE MEK IS A MILITARIZED </p><p>ORGANIZATION WHOSE OPPOSITION TACTICS HAVE INCLUDED </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST IRAN.   IRAN HAS ASSASSINATED </p><p>DOZENS OF NEK MEMBERS, AND BECAUSE IT IS BASED PARTLY IN </p><p>IRAQ, MUCH IRANIAN RETALIATION HAS TAKEN PLACE IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>--    KURDISH DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF IRAN:  THE KDP-I ENGAGES </p><p>MOSTLY IN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES IN OPPOSITION TO THE </p><p>TEHRAN REGIME, THOUGH IT HAS ALSO CLASHED WITH IRANIAN </p><p>MILITARY UNITS.   IRAN HAS ASSASSINATED TWO KDP-I </p><p>SECRETARIES-GENERAL.   IN 1994 ALONE, THREE MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>GROUP WERE KILLED IN IRAQ, TURKEY, AND DENMARK, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY, AND A FOURTH WAS WOUNDED IN SWEDEN BY A </p><p>LETTER BOMB. </p><p> </p><p>--    IRANIAN PEOPLE\'S FEDAYEEN (IPF):  IN SEPTEMBER 1995, </p><p>ALI TAVASSOLI, A FORMER LEADER OF THE IPF, WAS KIDNAPPED </p><p>IN BAKU, AZERBAIJAN BY ~OIS OFFICERS. </p><p> </p><p>--    NON-VIOLENT OPPOSITION FIGURES:  FORMER IRANIAN </p><p>PRIME NINISTER BAKHTIAR AND AN AIDE WERE ASSASSINATED IN </p><p>PARIS IN 1991.   A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION GROUP, "FLAG </p><p>OF FREEDOM," WAS ASSASSINATED IN PARIS IN 1990.  FOUR </p><p>DISSIDENTS WERE ASSASSINATED IN BERLIN IN 1992, AND REZA </p><p>NAZLUMAN, AN OFFICIAL UNDER THE SHAH, WAS ASSASSINATED IN </p><p>PARIS IN 1996.   GERMAN COURTS HAVE ISSUED AN ARREST </p><p>WARRANT FOR NOIS CHIEF FALLAHIAN BASED ON EVIDENCE IN THE </p><p>BERLIN TRIAL, AND GERMAN AUTHORITIES WERE SUFFICIENTLY </p><p>CONVINCED BY FRENCH INFORMATION TO EXTRADITE AN IRANIAN </p><p>TO PARIS TO STAND TRIAL IN THE NAZLUMAN KILLING. </p><p> </p><p>--    SALMAN RUSHDIE:  IRAN HAS REFUSED TO RESCIND ITS </p><p>DEATH SENTENCE AGAINST INDIAN-BORN BRITISH AUTHOR SALMAN </p><p>RUSHDIE.   THIS MONTH, RUSHDIE\'S SCHEDULED RECEIPT OF A </p><p>EUROPEAN LITERARY AWARD IN COPENHAGEN CAUSED SUCH A ROW </p><p>OVER SECURITY PRECAUTIONS THAT IT ALMOST BROUGHT DOWN THE </p><p>DANISH GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p>11.   (S)  IRAN IS MAKING A DETERMINED EFFORT TO DEVELOP </p><p>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (WND) AND TO ACQUIRE </p><p>BALLISTIC MISSILES CAPABLE OF DELIVERING WP~D TO REGIONAL </p><p>TARGETS. </p><p> </p><p>12.   (S)  IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  DESPITE ITS OUTWARD </p><p>ADHERENCE TO THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY (NPT), </p><p>IRAN IS ATTEMPTING SECRETLY TO DEVELOP A NUCLEAR WEAPONS </p><p>CAPABILITY.   IRAN HAS DEDICATED CIVILIAN AND MILITARY </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ATTEMPTING TO ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP </p><p>NUCLEAR FACILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT </p><p>WITH A PURELY PEACEFUL NUCLEAR PROGRAM, BUT WHICH ARE </p><p>CRITICAL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FISSILE MATERIAL FOR </p><p>NUCLEAR WEAPONS.   IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS HEAVILY </p><p>DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN ASSISTANCE, BUT, TO DATE, MOST </p><p>SUPPLIERS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHINA AND RUSSIA, HAVE </p><p>REFUSED TO COOPERATE. </p><p> </p><p>13.   (S)  PLUTONIUM.  IRAN HAS ATTEMPTED TO ACQUIRE THE </p><p>CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE BOTH PLUTONIUM AND HIGHLY ENRICHED </p><p>URANIUM.   IN THE CASE OF PLUTONIUM, IRAN HAS BEEN TRYING </p><p>FOR MANY YEARS TO PURCHASE NUCLEAR REACTORS THAT ARE </p><p>OPTIMIZED FOR PRODUCING WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM AND NOT </p><p>ELECTRICITY.   SPECIFICALLY, IT HAS TRIED--SO FAR </p><p>UNSUCCESSFULLY--TO ACQUIRE A LARGE, HEAVY WATER- </p><p>MODERATED, NATURAL-URANIUM-FUELED REACTOR AND ASSOCIATED </p><p>FACILITIES.   THIS TYPE OF REACTOR HAS LITTLE USE IN </p><p>IRATI\'S CIVILIAN PROGRAM, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN BASED ON </p><p>LIGHT-WATER REACTORS. </p><p> </p><p>14.   (S) ENRICHED URANIUM.  IRAN HAS CONDUCTED RESEARCH </p><p>ON AT LEAST THREE URANIUM ENRICHMENT TECHNOLOGIES--GAS </p><p>CENTRIFUGE, GASEOUS DIFFUSION, AND LASER ISOTOPE </p><p>SEPARATION.   IRANIAN PROCUREMENT EFFORTS SUGGEST IRAN IS </p><p>GIVING THE GREATEST ATTENTION TO GAS CENTRIFUGE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND IS ATTEMPTING COVERTLY TO PROCURE THE </p><p>REQUIRED MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>15.   (S)  INTERNATIONAL MONITORING.  IRAN HAS ATTEMPTED </p><p>TO ALLAY INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS ABOUT ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM </p><p>BY INVITING THE IAEA TO VISIT ANY IAEA-DESIGNATED </p><p>FACILITIES IN IRAN.   THE IAEA HAS MADE SPECIAL VISITS TO </p><p>IRAN, BUT HAS NOT DISCOVERED ANY SIGNS OF A NUCLEAR </p><p>WEAPONS PROGRAM.   THIS IS NOT SURPRISING SINCE IRAN\'S </p><p>PROGRAM HAS NOT PROGRESSED TO THE STAGE WHERE WEAPONS- </p><p>RELATED FACILITIES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED. </p><p> </p><p>--    WITH RESPECT TO THESE VISITS, THE IAEA HAS TAKEN </p><p>CARE TO NOTE THAT IT CANNOT VOUCH FOR FACILITIES AND </p><p>SITES NOT VISITED, NOR CAN IT PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>THAT THE SITES IT HAS VISITED COULD BE USED FOR OTHER </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>16.   (S)  IRAN\'S MISSILE PROGRAM.  IRAN\'S BALLISTIC </p><p>MISSILE PROGRAM DATES BACK TO THE EARLY 1980S AND HAS </p><p>MADE STEADY PROGRESS.   WE BELIEVE IRANIAN LEADERS VIEW </p><p>ITS MISSILE PROGRAM AS INDISPENSABLE IN PERMITTING IT TO </p><p>THREATEN AND STRIKE A VARIETY OF TARGETS IN THE REGION. </p><p>DURING THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR, TEHRAN DEMONSTRATED ITS </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO USE BALLISTIC MISSILES AGAINST POPULATION </p><p>CENTERS (AS DID IRAQ). </p><p> </p><p>--    IRAN HAS OVER 300 SCUD B AND SCUD C MISSILES, WITH </p><p>RANGES OF 300 AND 500 KILOMETERS, RESPECTIVELY.   IRAN </p><p>ALSO HAS ACQUIRED FROM CHINA MORE THAN 200 CSS-8 SURFACE- </p><p>TO-SURFACE BALLISTIC MISSILES, WITH A RANGE OF 150 </p><p>KILOMETERS, WHICH ARE MORE ACCURATE THAN OTHER MISSILES </p><p>IN IRAN\'S INVENTORY. </p><p> </p><p>--    IRAN IS ASSEMBLING BOTH SCUD B AND SCUD C MISSILES </p><p>FROM NORTH KOREAN-SUPPLIED PARTS, AND IT IS LIKELY TO </p><p>ACHIEVE A FULLY INDIGENOUS PRODUCTION CAPABILITY SOON, IF </p><p>IT HAS NOT ALREADY DONE SO. </p><p> </p><p>--    IRAN AND NORTH KOREA SIGNED A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR </p><p>CONTRACT FOR THE 1,000 KILOMETER RANGE NO DONG MISSILE IN </p><p>1993, THOUGH THAT CONTRACT WAS LATER SUSPENDED.   WITH THE </p><p>NO DONG,  IRAN COULD TARGET MOST OF CENTRAL ASIA AND THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST, AND PARTS OF SOUTH ASIA AND EUROPE. </p><p> </p><p>--    IRAN HAS ALSO ATTEMPTED TO ACQUIRE MEDIUM-RANGE </p><p>MISSILE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE FORMER SOVIET UNION AND WANTS </p><p>TO DEVELOP ITS OWN MEDIUM-RANGE SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>17.   (S)  IRANIAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  IRAN\'S OFFENSIVE </p><p>CHEMICAL WARFARE (CW) PROGRAM BEGAN IN 1983 DURING THE </p><p>IRAN-IRAQ WAR.   SINCE THE CW PROGRAM\'S INCEPTION, IRAN </p><p>PROBABLY HAS PRODUCED AS MUCH AS 2000 METRIC TONS OF </p><p>BLISTER, BLOOD, AND CHOKING AGENTS. </p><p> </p><p>--    IRAN IS CURRENTLY PROCURING ITEMS AND TECHNOLOGY </p><p>WHICH WILL ALLOW THE PRODUCTION OF HIGHLY LETHAL NERVE </p><p>AGENTS. </p><p> </p><p>--    IRAN COULD DISSEMINATE THESE AGENTS VIA TRADITIONAL </p><p>TACTICAL SYSTEMS (I.E. ARTILLERY, MORTARS AND ROCKETS), </p><p>AS WELL AS AERIAL BOMBS OR POSSIBLY MISSILES. </p><p> </p><p>--    IRAN IS STRIVING TO BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT IN BOTH </p><p>CHEMICAL AND BIO-WARFARE PRODUCTION.   GREAT EFFORTS HAVE </p><p>BEEN MADE TO ESTABLISH THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE MANY OF THE </p><p>KEY PRECURSORS NEEDED TO ENSURE AN UNINTERRUPTED SUPPLY </p><p>OF PRECURSORS.   NOT ONLY WOULD THIS ASSIST IRAN\'S OWN CW </p><p>PROGRAM, BUT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE SALE OF THESE CHEMICAL </p><p>PRECURSORS TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION FOR </p><p>DESPERATELY NEEDED HARD CURRENCY. </p><p> </p><p>18.   (S)  IRANIAN BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.  IRAN\'S BIOLOGICAL </p><p>WARFARE (BW) PROGRAM ALSO BEGAN IN 1983.   SINCE THE LATE </p><p>1980\'S, MILITARY PROCUREMENT ENTITIES HAVE BEEN SEEKING </p><p>DUAL-USE BIOLOGICAL PROCESS EQUIPMENT SUITABLE FOR R&D </p><p>AND PRODUCTION OF BW AGENTS. </p><p> </p><p>--    WE BELIEVE IRAN IS CURRENTLY PRODUCING LAB-SCALE </p><p>QUANTITIES OF SOME BW AGENTS. </p><p> </p><p>--    AN OFFICIAL IRANIAN DOCUMENT OBTAINED IN 1986 </p><p>INDICATED THAT TEHRAN HAD A LIMITED ABILITY TO EMPLOY BW. </p><p>IN BATTLE SITUATIONS, THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE DONE WITH </p><p>THE SAME DELIVERY METHODS USED BY THE IRANIAN CW PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHRISTOPHER </p><p></p></div>
