<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001743 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINR, PREL, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN RIOS MONTT CANDIDACY, </p><p>LEAVING CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AS FINAL ARBITER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 1479 </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 1530 </p><p>     C. GUATEMALA 1561 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On July 4, the Supreme Court denied the appeal of FRG </p><p>presidential candidate Efrain Rios Montt against a decision </p><p>of the Registry of Citizens (Ref A) which stated that he </p><p>could not be a candidate for President based on prohibitions </p><p>contained in Article 186 of the Constitution.  Twelve of the </p><p>Supreme Court magistrates voted to uphold the decision of the </p><p>Registry of Citizens, and one voted against.  The Supreme </p><p>Court decision was widely expected, following an earlier </p><p>ruling by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (reftels). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Rios Montt\'s legal representatives appealed the </p><p>Supreme Court decision to the Constitutional Court, which has </p><p>ten days to rule.  The Constitutional Court has the final say </p><p>in the matter, and its decision can not be appealed.  Press </p><p>reports claim that Rios Montt told followers that four of the </p><p>seven Constitutional Court magistrates favor overturning the </p><p>decision of the Registry of Citizens, thus allowing him to </p><p>run for President. It is widely believed that the </p><p>Constitutional Court in fact may be favorable to a </p><p>constitutional interpretation that would enable Rios Montt to </p><p>be a candidate. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Opposition and civil society leaders quoted in the </p><p>anti-government press lauded the decision of the Supreme </p><p>Court.  They called on the Constitutional Court to follow the </p><p>lead of the Registry of Citizens, the Supreme Electoral </p><p>Tribunal and the Supreme Court. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
