<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000773 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND DRL </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: CONDITIONS IN INSEIN PRISON </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) RANGOON 377 </p><p>     B. (B) RANGOON 724 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p> (C) 1. Summary: According to a report from a recently </p><p>released inmate, conditions in Burma\'s Insein prison have </p><p>deteriorated badly following the discovery of a microphone in </p><p>a room being used by UN Special Rapporteur Pinheiro for </p><p>interviews with inmates in March (reftel A).  The prison </p><p>warden at Insein was replaced immediately following that </p><p>incident and the new warden has imposed a new, and far </p><p>harsher, regime which has rolled back many of the </p><p>improvements introduced by ICRC since 1999.  TVs, newspapers </p><p>and all writing materials and writing implements have been </p><p>taken away, and socializing is strictly controlled.  Food, </p><p>sanitation and health conditions remain poor, security has </p><p>increased and prisoners are now regularly subjected to </p><p>punishing physical exercises, and beaten.  Political </p><p>prisoners are segregated from the general prison population, </p><p>but there are indications that some may have been abused, </p><p>including some who may have been in Aung San Suu Kyi\'s convoy </p><p>on May 30.  We have passed a copy of the report to ICRC. </p><p>They have confirmed that the warden at Insein Prison was </p><p>replaced following the incident with Special Rapporteur </p><p>Pinheiro.  They have also promised to investigate conditions </p><p>at Insein when they next visit, probably in July. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The following is an edited version of the former </p><p>inmate\'s report. </p><p> </p><p>The former inmate is not a political prisoner.  He was </p><p>arrested by the police in August 2002 and was locked up in </p><p>Insein prison until he was released on bail in March 2003. He </p><p>met with ICRC during ICRC\'s prison visit in November 2002. </p><p>After ICRC,s visit, the warden of Insein prison improved the </p><p>facilities and arranged some entertainment programs for the </p><p>prisoners.  The improved system lasted until March 2003, when </p><p>the incident occurred with Special Rapporteur Pinheiro </p><p>(reftel A). The authorities immediately changed the prison </p><p>warden on the grounds that he had damaged the image of the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>The inmate was rearrested and sent back to the Insein prison </p><p>in June 2003.  He found that the prison had changed totally. </p><p>Security was much tighter.  He and other inmates were </p><p>searched thoroughly, and the snacks he brought with him were </p><p>taken away by the prison authorities.  He was also ordered to </p><p>leave all papers, pens, books, and other items at the gate. </p><p>On their first day, the new inmates were made to sit on the </p><p>wet ground in the rain, while the new warden laid down the </p><p>rules for prison operations.  In his speech, the warden told </p><p>them that they were there because they are criminals and that </p><p>the prison authorities would treat them like criminals.  The </p><p>authorities did not care about ICRC, the warden said.  The </p><p>world community may say the condition of this jail is poor </p><p>but "we do not care" because this is prison --  a place to </p><p>keep criminals like them.  The warden also warned that if </p><p>inmates tell anyone about happenings within the prison, they </p><p>will suffer severe punishment and will spend the rest of </p><p>their life in the prison, regardless of their current </p><p>sentences. </p><p> </p><p>The inmate said that all inmates are now obliged to fall in </p><p>and perform &ponsan8 -- punishing physical exercises -- </p><p>each morning.  This practice had been stopped following </p><p>ICRC\'s visit November 2002, but was resumed in June.  If the </p><p>inmates could not perform according to order, they were </p><p>beaten with rough batons.  Since June 12, the new warden has </p><p>also banned all TVs and newspapers from the prison. No </p><p>prisoner is now allowed to carry a ball pen, a piece of paper </p><p>or anything that can be used to write. </p><p> </p><p>Health and sanitation conditions are also poor.  Many inmates </p><p>who suffer from communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, </p><p>hepatitis B; etc. remain in the general prison population; </p><p>they have not been segregated.  Toilets are in poor shape and </p><p>little water is available for bathing.  Food is also poor. </p><p>For lunch, inmates get a bowl of thin bean soup and a plate </p><p>of rice. For dinner, they get a bowl of &Yay-Baw-Law,8 a </p><p>kind of prison soup composed of herbs and vegetables found in </p><p>the prison courtyard, a small portion of &Ngapi8 (fish </p><p>paste - sometimes with &maggots8) and a plate of rice. The </p><p>rice was generally full of crushed rice, husks and stones. </p><p>Socializing has also been restricted.  There is no </p><p>entertainment, all prison visits are monitored, and all </p><p>packages brought to the prison are screened thoroughly by </p><p>plain-clothes security personnel. The prison has also now </p><p>forbidden inmates to sit or talk together in groups of more </p><p>than four; any inmates found sitting together in larger </p><p>groups are beaten. </p><p> </p><p>Political Prisoners </p><p> </p><p>Political prisoners are kept in a special barracks next to </p><p>the barracks in which the inmate was kept.  The whole </p><p>building is built of concrete and well protected by walls so </p><p>that nobody can see the political prisoners and their </p><p>activities. The barracks are divided into cells that can </p><p>house two or three persons.  At present, however, there were </p><p>8 to 10 persons in a cell.  Altogether, there are an </p><p>estimated 230 inmates in the barracks for political </p><p>prisoners.  The political prisoners\' barracks has a small </p><p>courtyard and, unlike the other barracks, does have a bathing </p><p>hall and a walking place where the political prisoners are </p><p>allowed to walk in the early morning.  Occasionally inmates </p><p>see political prisoners, in hoods to conceal their </p><p>identities, dragged from the political prisoners barracks to </p><p>the prison hospital.  On the third day of his detention, the </p><p>inmate himself saw seven hooded prisoners dragged to the </p><p>hospital by prison officials.  When he asked one of the </p><p>prison guards who the prisoners were, he was told that they </p><p>were the &problem makers who went along with Suu Kyi.8  He </p><p>also heard that there is a special &bungalow8 next to the </p><p>political prisoners\' barracks where Aung San Suu Kyi is </p><p>supposed to be detained, but is not sure that that is true. </p><p>(Note: However, this information correlates with reftel B, </p><p>para. 2 regarding the special "bungalow" built for Aung San </p><p>Suu Kyi within Insein.) The inmate also said that the prison </p><p>wards are now watched not only by prison guards, but also </p><p>plain clothes personnel. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment: We will have to wait until ICRC visits Insein </p><p>before judging whether all the details in this report are </p><p>accurate.  However, it does have the ring of truth.  It would </p><p>make sense for the authorities to tighten security and </p><p>discipline following the incident with Pinheiro.  That would </p><p>be even more true if NLD members who were picked up following </p><p>the attack in Depeyin were lodged at Insein.  Whatever the </p><p>reason for the crackdown, however, it does appear that the </p><p>GOB may have begun to roll back, at least at Insein prison, </p><p>reforms encouraged by ICRC following its 1999 to 2002 prison </p><p>visits.  If so, it would be one more setback for </p><p>international efforts to improve human rights in Burma.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
