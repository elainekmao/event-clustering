ALMOST AS LOCAL EVIDENCE OF LIBYAN LEADER COLONEL </p><p>QADHAFI\'S CURRENT DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE SOUTH OF THE </p><p>SAHARA, THE INDEPENDENT LAGOS DAILY, THE GUARDIAN, </p><p>PUBLISHED ON APRIL 15, 1985, THE FOLLOWING EXCLUSIVE </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH HIM, BYLINED BY YEMI OGUNBIYI.  IT CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THE INTERVIEW WAS QADHAFI\'S "FIRST WITH AN AFRICAN </p><p>NEWSPAPER HOUSE OUTSIDE THE ARAB WORLD AND, INDEED, HIS </p><p>FIRST WITH ANY NEWSPAPER IN SEVERAL YEARS."  IT INCLUDED </p><p>A PICTURE OF QADHAFI TALKING WITH THE ARTICLE\'S AUTHOR </p><p>AND GUARDIAN PUBLISHER MR. ALEX IBRU, REPORTEDLY AT </p><p>SALAHADDIN MILITARY BARRACKS IN BENGHAZI.  QADHAFI SPOKE </p><p>IN ARABIC AND USED AN INTERPRETER.  THE INTERVIEW TOOK </p><p>PLACE "BARELY TEN DAYS BEFORE OUSTED PRESIDENT JAAFAR </p><p>JIMEIRY LEFT FOR A VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES IN SEARCH </p><p>OF AID."  QADHAFI WAS CHARACTERIZED AS LUKEWARM TOWARD </p><p>NIGERIA. </p><p>- </p><p>2.  BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>-      GADDAFI DEFENDS LIBYA\'S DYNAMIC FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>- </p><p>-  IN A RARE NEWSPAPER INTERVIEW, THE LEADER OF THE </p><p>SOCIALIST PEOPLE\'S LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA, COLONEL </p><p>MUAMMAR AL GADDAFI, HAS DENIED THAT HIS SEEMINGLY MILI- </p><p>TANT AND AGGRESSIVE FOREIGN POLICY IN AFRICA IS A </p><p>CAMOUFLAGE FOR ANY EXPANSIONIST AMBITION. </p><p> </p><p>-  SPEAKING IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH THE GUARDIAN </p><p>AT THE SALAHADDIN MILITARY BARRACKS IN BENGHAZI, LIBYA, </p><p>COL. GADDAFI ANSWERED A WIDE RANGE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS </p><p>FORCEFUL STYLE OF POLITICS AND DIPLOMACY. </p><p>- </p><p>-  IN THE PROCESS, HE STOUTLY DEFENDED HIS DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ROLE AS A LIBERATING ONE FOR THE CAUSE OF ARAB AND AFRICAN </p><p>UNITY AND WAS VERY CRITICAL OF THOSE WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS </p><p>"FOREIGN ENEMIES" WHO WERE DETERMINED TO PORTRAY HIS IMAGE </p><p>IN VERY BAD LIGHT. </p><p>- </p><p>-   "LET ME STATE FROM THE OUTSET THAT THE ROLE WE SEE </p><p>OURSELVES AS PLAYING, NOT ONLY IN AFRICA BUT ALSO IN THE </p><p>THIRD WORLD, IS A LIBERATING ONE.  BUT OUR ENEMIES DO NOT </p><p>SEE THIS ROLE AS A LIBERATING ONE.  THEY HAVE THEIR OWN </p><p>DELIBERATE MISINTERPRETATION WHICH IS QUITE MISLEADING." </p><p> </p><p>-  THE SON OF A BEDUIN ARAB, COL. GADDAFI, 43, CAME TO </p><p>POWER ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1969, WHEN HE AND A GROUP OF FREE </p><p>OFFICERS OVERTHREW KING IDRIS IN A BLOODLESS COUP.  THERE- </p><p>AFTER, THEY DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO TRANSFORMING THIS </p><p>LARGE COUNTRY OF A THREE MILLION PEOPLE "FROM A BACKWARD </p><p>STATE INTO A MODERN NATION." </p><p> </p><p>-  EASILY ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL LEADERS IN THE </p><p>WORLD TODAY, GADDAFI HAS EARNED FOR HIMSELF THE EMINENT, </p><p>IF SOMETIMES PROBLEMATIC REPUTATION OF BEING ONE OF THE </p><p>MOST ACKNOWLEDGED LEADERS IN THE ARAB WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>- THE GUARDIAN INTERVIEW WAS HIS FIRST WITH AN AFRICAN </p><p>NEWSPAPER HOUSE OUTSIDE THE ARAB WORLD AND, INDEED, HIS </p><p>FIRST WITH ANY NEWSPAPER IN SEVERAL YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>-  OF THE GUARDIAN, HE HAD THIS TO SAY:  "I HAVE A GREAT </p><p>OPINION OF YOUR PAPER AND IT DESERVES ALL THE SUPPORT AND </p><p>PRAISE THAT IT IS RECEIVING.  FOR, INDEED, WE NEED REAL </p><p>AFRICAN NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES WHICH CAN SPEAK UP FOR </p><p>AFRICA.  IT IS SAD ENOUGH THAT AFRICANS GET TO READ ABOUT </p><p>THEMSELVES ONLY FROM EUROPEAN OR THE AMERICAN MEDIA.  I </p><p>AM PLEASED THAT I CAN MEET WITH YOU AND THAT WE CAN </p><p>EXCHANGE VIEWS." </p><p> </p><p>-  SPEAKING VERY QUIETLY IN ARABIC THROUGH AN INTERPRETER, </p><p>HIS PLACID FACE BETRAYING AN OUTWARD CALM WHICH JARS </p><p>SHARPLY WITH HIS CONTROVERSIAL REPUTATION, COL. GADDAFI </p><p>SPOKE AT SOME LENGTH ON THE PROBLEMS OF ARAB UNITY AND </p><p>ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR A LARGER AFRICAN UNDERSTANDING </p><p>AND ACCORD. </p><p> </p><p>-  REPORTEDLY, HE DEFENDED HIS SUPPORT FOR MANY REGIMES </p><p>IN AFRICA AND SAW SUCH SUPPORT AS VALID WITHIN THE TOTAL </p><p>FRAMEWORK OF AN AFRICAN SOLIDARITY AND UNITY. </p><p>- </p><p>-   "ALL THE EFFORTS TO UNITE WITH EGYPT, SUDAN, SYRIA, </p><p>ETHIOPIA AND CHAD WHICH YOU REFERRED TO, WERE ATTEMPTS </p><p>TO UNITE THE ARAB WORLD AS ONE NATION.  THE ARABS AS A </p><p>WHOLE ARE LIKE ONE NATION.  THEY SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE, </p><p>HAVE THE SAME ORIGINS AND ABOUT 98 PER CENT HAVE AND </p><p>PRACTISE ONE FAITH.  AND FOR US, THE UNITY OF THE ARAB </p><p>WORLD IS ONE STEP TOWARDS THE TOTAL UNITY OF THE AFRICAN </p><p>CONTINENT." </p><p> </p><p>-  COL. GADDAFI WAS VERY CRITICAL OF MOST ARAB COUNTRIES </p><p>WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS REACTIONARY, ESPECIALLY FOR BEING </p><p>LY DEPENDENT ON WESTERN COUNTRIES FOR THEIR </p><p>SURVIVAL. </p><p> </p><p>-   "UNFORTUNATELY, TOO, THERE ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF NON- </p><p>ARAB COUNTRIES IN AFRICA WHO ASLO BEHAVE IN SIMILAR MANNER, </p><p>WHO ARE FOREVER HOPING AND BELIEVING THAT THE WEST WILL </p><p>BAIL THEM OUT OF THEIR OWN BANKRUPT AND CORRUPT POLICIES. </p><p>BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THEIR VERY DEPENDENCE ON THE </p><p>WEST SHORTENS THEIR LIVES (EXCLAMATION POINT)" </p><p> </p><p>-    THE INTERVIEW WAS HELD BARELY 10 DAYS BEFORE OUSTED </p><p>PRESIDENT JAAFAR NIMEIRY OF SUDAN LEFT FOR A VISIT TO THE </p><p>UNITED STATES IN SEARCH OF AID BEFORE HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>OVERTHROWN. </p><p> </p><p>-  BUT COL. GADDAFI SAVED HIS SEVEREST ATTACKS FOR THOSE </p><p>WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS ZIONISTS AND IMPERIALIST AGGRESSORS </p><p>IN THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>-  INSISTING THAT ARABS MUST NOT BE MADE TO BEAR THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES OF HITLER\'S CRIMES,  HE REITERATED HIS </p><p>NOW FAMILIAR CALL, PRESUMABLY ON THE STATE OF ISRAEL, TO </p><p>RETURN ALL ARAB LANDS. </p><p> </p><p>-  ON HIS RELATIONS WITH NIGERIA, HE WAS FAR MORE </p><p>LUKEWARM AND GUARDED IN HIS REACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-  "OUR RELATIONS CAN BE BETTER THAN THEY ARE NOW," HE </p><p>SAID. </p><p> </p><p>-  HIS TEPID RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION OF RELATIONS WITH </p><p>NIGERIA MAY NOT BE UNCONNECTED, POLITICAL OBSERVERS BE- </p><p>LIEVE, WITH LIBYA\'S ROLE IN CHAD, NIGERIA\'S NORTH-EASTERN </p><p>NEIGHBOUR. </p><p>- </p><p>-  BUT HE DEFENDED THE INTERVENTION OF LIBYA IN CHAD ALL </p><p>THE SAME, ARGUING THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF </p><p>LIBYA TO HAVE AN UNSTABLE CHAD, SINCE IT ALSO SHARES </p><p>BORDERS WITH LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>-  PRESSED WHETHER HE KEPT TO THE AGREEMENT ON THE MUTUAL </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM CHAD REACHED WITH FRANCE, HE </p><p>RETORTED:  "OF COURSE, WE HONOURED THE AGREEMENT.  WE </p><p>WITHDREW OUR TROOPS.  THERE WERE RUMOURS, POSSIBLY BEING </p><p>PUT OUT BY AMERICANS, TO THE EFFECT THAT WE HAD NOT WITH- </p><p>DRAWN OUR TROOPS.  OBVIOUSLY, FRANCE IS LOOKING FOR AN </p><p>EXCUSE TO COME BACK TO CHAD." </p><p>- </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p>- </p><p>SMITH </p><p></p></div>
