<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001495 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (MBUCKLEY); IIP/G/WHA DIPASQUALE; EB/EPPD DCLUNE; </p><p>USTR AGASH </p><p>INFO IIP/T/ES </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, IOs, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA, ETRD, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON CAFTA, JUNE 25, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Op-ed by Rodil Rivera on Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily </p><p>"La Tribuna" on 6/25 entitled "The Fifth Column of CAFTA". </p><p>". plain and simple, Guatemala is acting as the fifth column </p><p>of the U.S. negotiators, to force us to give in on the few </p><p>points where Central America has presented some resistance. </p><p>In other words, our Guatemalan `brothers\' are helping to </p><p>twist our arm. If there remains any doubt about it, we only </p><p>need to read what Barbara Bowie-Whitman stated in the plain </p><p>words of trade specialists, `If anyone wants to be more </p><p>ambitious in its offer, we can reach an agreement faster\'." </p><p> </p><p>"About the chance of Guatemala withdrawing its proposal, </p><p>Regina Vargo answered for Salomon Cohen, the lead Guatemalan </p><p>negotiator, saying, `Guatemala can\'t do that, because it\'s </p><p>impossible to turn in a product offered with a  zero-tariff </p><p>for one with a higher tariff. we can\'t go forward this way\'. </p><p>This means that this is no longer a negotiation, it is a </p><p>mere puppet show where Vargo is a ventriloquist and Cohen </p><p>the U.S. puppet." </p><p> </p><p>"Is there anything we can do against a decision already </p><p>taken by the U.S.? Is there any chance that CAFTA could </p><p>actually be somewhat beneficial for Honduras and Central </p><p>America, as some people think? I don\'t know. I\'m firmly </p><p>convinced that this criticism may help our negotiators and </p><p>private entrepreneurs to do the best they can to get some </p><p>benefits from CAFTA and, at least, to exclude agricultural </p><p>products from the agreement." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
