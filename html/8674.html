Please provide a short evaluative narrative of </p><p>host government commitment to fiscal transparency and </p><p>accountability (not to exceed two or three </p><p>paragraphs). </p><p> </p><p>Maldives government is praised for good economic </p><p>management and generally prudent macroeconomic </p><p>management.  Nonetheless weaknesses in budget process </p><p>have been identified.  The existing budget process and </p><p>public accounting system was introduced more than </p><p>three decades ago and is subject to a number of </p><p>constraints.  The budget papers are usually prepared </p><p>in December of each year for submission to the </p><p>Parliament and comprise the past year\'s performance, </p><p>current years status and proposed future budget </p><p>proposals.  The financial legislative framework is not </p><p>comprehensive.  Under the current legislative </p><p>framework, no annual financial statements regarding </p><p>the government\'s financial position and status are </p><p>reported to the parliament and no audited financial </p><p>statements are prepared.  The annual accounts and </p><p>information are included in the budget papers.  In </p><p>fact, no policies identify the ownership and </p><p>responsibility for the accounting function, and </p><p>provide for a data entry system.  Only a limited </p><p>accounting reporting structure exists.  Not all </p><p>transactions are reflected.  The accounting system </p><p>used in atolls is highly inefficient, leading to </p><p>excessive holdings and movements of cash. </p><p> </p><p>Maldives Constitution gives broad powers to the </p><p>executive branch in performing most of the core </p><p>functions relating to public expenditure and budget </p><p>management, planning, execution, monitoring and </p><p>evaluation.  The power of budget approval rests with </p><p>the legislature.  Currently, the President is also the </p><p>Finance Minister. </p><p> </p><p>The Auditor General is appointed by the President and </p><p>reports to the President.  The Constitution provides </p><p>for certain accounting functions of the State to be </p><p>performed by the Auditor General.  However, the </p><p>Auditor General is obliged to act on the advice of the </p><p>President in this regard.  Accordingly, ultimate power </p><p>and authority for determining the manner and form of </p><p>public accounting system, under the constitution, </p><p>rests with the President. </p><p> </p><p>Three key bills including a new public finance act, </p><p>amendments to the audit act and the public enterprise </p><p>act have been drafted to define the legal framework </p><p>for an improved budget process. </p><p> </p><p>n.  Please list U.S. government-sponsored programs and </p><p>activities that promote accurate disclosure of </p><p>revenues and expenditures in the national budgets of </p><p>your host country. Please also summarize the results </p><p>of those programs and activities (not to exceed two or </p><p>three paragraphs). </p><p> </p><p>There are no US Government sponsored programs.  ADB </p><p>and the World Bank are trying to promote budget </p><p>practices and improve financial reporting, </p><p>transparency and accounting.  ADB has approved a </p><p>project for strengthening Public Accounting Systems. </p><p>WB has provided training assistance in Public </p><p>Expenditure Management. </p><p> </p><p>End Questionnaire. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
