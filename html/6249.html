<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 OTTAWA 000659 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ; AFGHANISTAN; TURKEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "Pope has zeal, but no answer on Iraq question" </p><p>Columnist Marcus Gee noted in the leading Globe and </p><p>Mail (3/6) that, "John Paul is dead against war and he </p><p>is not afraid to say so.... To drive his antiwar </p><p>message home, John Paul has met many of the leading </p><p>players in the Iraq debate: British Prime Minister Tony </p><p>Blair, Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz, United </p><p>Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Italian Prime </p><p>Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Spanish Prime Minister </p><p>Jose Maria Aznar.... The Pope\'s surprisingly muscular </p><p>intervention puts him at odds with the two </p><p>devoted Christians who are leading the campaign against </p><p>Iraq - Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair - and sets up a </p><p>remarkable debate over the morality of the planned </p><p>war.... Both Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush believe just as </p><p>strongly as the Pope that their course is the morally </p><p>correct one. In fact, as opposition to the war has </p><p>grown, both have begun framing their arguments in moral </p><p>terms.... If war is the wrong answer, what, in the case </p><p>of Iraq, is the right one? To this, Christ\'s Vicar has </p><p>no good answer." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Ever new lines in the sand" </p><p>Editorial page editor emeritus Haroon Siddiqui </p><p>commented in the liberal Toronto Star (3/6): "Another </p><p>week, another American rationale for hurtling toward an </p><p>invasion of Iraq.... What we are witnessing in </p><p>Washington is a dangerously ideological administration </p><p>so bent on waging war that it would say just about </p><p>anything to justify its holy mission." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "The `evil axis\' hits back" </p><p>The liberal Toronto Star editorialized (3/5): "As U.S. </p><p>President George Bush gets ready to crush Saddam </p><p>Hussein, the rest of the \'axis of evil\' are feeling </p><p>Saddam\'s pain. But far from being cowed, North Korea </p><p>and Iran seem determined to deny Bush the chance to do </p><p>to them what he\'s about to do to Saddam. It\'s getting </p><p>prickly out there. In Korea, the mercurial Kim Jong-il </p><p>has countered a threat with a crisis. He has an illegal </p><p>nuclear bomb or two, and is eyeing an assembly line.... </p><p>Iran, too, is a worry. Tehran has a murky </p><p>\'peaceful\' nuclear program that\'s getting murkier. It </p><p>has rebuffed IAEA requests for better access to nuclear </p><p>sites.... All the talk in Washington of \'taking out\' </p><p>Saddam\'s regime before it can arm itself with horror </p><p>weapons has emboldened Korea, and tempted Iran, to </p><p>shield themselves from attack by acquiring the very </p><p>nukes Saddam lacks. Washington\'s aggressive doctrine of </p><p>`pre-emptively\' smashing regimes that pose no threat </p><p>but in theory might risks inviting an arms race that </p><p>can only damage U.S. interests. Having </p><p>loosed this stampede, Bush must now try to rein it in. </p><p>The campaign against terror remains America\'s chief </p><p>priority. But getting North Korea to abandon its nukes </p><p>and persuading Iran not to go down the nuclear road </p><p>ought to be high on the presidential agenda. Higher </p><p>than regime change in Iraq. Iraq is a problem. But </p><p>Korea is a crisis. And Iran is fast becoming one. </p><p>However Bush may loathe Pyongyang and Tehran, he needs </p><p>to cool his moralizing, rein in his hawkish advisers </p><p>and deploy skilled diplomats to engage these regimes </p><p>in a dialogue to head off catastrophe. Toppling Saddam </p><p>is a potentially fatal distraction." </p><p> </p><p>4.   "Murky message hurts U.S. case for war in Iraq" </p><p>Columnist Marcus Gee observed in the leading Globe and </p><p>Mail (3/5): "Is the United States trying to disarm </p><p>Iraq\'s Saddam Hussein, or trying to remove him from </p><p>power? The simple answer: both. Washington believes </p><p>that the only way to make sure he disarms is to oust </p><p>him. That is why it is preparing to fight. But </p><p>somewhere on the road to Baghdad, that message has </p><p>become clouded, confusing U.S. allies and undermining </p><p>the case for war.... Despite all the confusion in the </p><p>wider world about regime change, the U.S. </p><p>administration is quite clear in its own mind about its </p><p>war aims, which have not changed a jot since the </p><p>beginning. Disarmament is the goal and ousting Saddam </p><p>Hussein the method. But by muddying the message, it has </p><p>hurt its case." </p><p> </p><p>5.   "Intolerable aggression" </p><p>The centrist Winnipeg Free Press editorialized (3/6): </p><p>"U.S. President George Bush has been expressing high </p><p>hopes lately about the secondary benefits that may </p><p>result from a military operation to disarm Iraqi </p><p>dictator Saddam Hussein. These could include freedom, </p><p>peace and prosperity for the people of Iraq and </p><p>neighbouring countries, establishment of a democratic </p><p>Palestinian state and peace for Israel. It is, however, </p><p>far from certain that these results can be achieved </p><p>through invasion of Iraq.... Results of that distant </p><p>kind lie far beyond Mr. Bush\'s control. America and its </p><p>allies should be conscious of both the dangers and the </p><p>opportunities, but they should not decide between war </p><p>and peace on the basis of hoped or feared results that, </p><p>for the moment, can only be guessed at. Invasion of </p><p>Iraq will cause death, injury and destruction of </p><p>property, mainly for Iraqis but also for the invaders. </p><p>That is a terrible course to adopt and many governments </p><p>on the United Nations Security Council have been </p><p>reluctant to agree to such a course. The other course, </p><p>however, is far worse. The other course is to tolerate </p><p>aggression.... Peace and security for all countries </p><p>depend on effective means for stopping aggression.... </p><p>The valid purpose for invading Iraq is to disarm Saddam </p><p>Hussein. That is worth doing for itself and for the </p><p>larger purpose of showing all would-be aggressors that </p><p>aggression is not tolerated. If the action leads to </p><p>general peace and contentment in the Arab world and the </p><p>Middle East, so much the better, but George Bush should </p><p>not count on it and he should not be surprised if his </p><p>action produces unwelcome results that he can neither </p><p>foresee nor prevent. The best possible result is </p><p>compliance by Iraq with the requirements of the </p><p>Security Council. Failing that, invasion to enforce </p><p>compliance is a cruel necessity. If compliance is not </p><p>enforced, then the invitation to aggression is issued </p><p>and the nations of the world must brace themselves for </p><p>the wars that will follow. " </p><p> </p><p>6.   "The triple veto". </p><p>Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le </p><p>Devoir (3/6): "The last word still belongs to the chief </p><p>inspectors who will present their report tomorrow. It </p><p>is worth pointing out that France has insisted that the </p><p>Blix expose be made in public and not in closed chamber </p><p>as it was originally planned.  Yesterday\'s gesture by </p><p>the Berlin-Moscow-Paris axis had an immediate impact. </p><p>Prime Minister Blair is more isolated than ever... By </p><p>playing his pieces so unilaterally, the leader of the </p><p>British government has gone beyond the point of no </p><p>return. If Washington decides to go ahead without the </p><p>support of the U.N., as Secretary of State Colin Powell </p><p>has predicted, Blair will be forced to follow. This man </p><p>who preferred action over the rule of law has put </p><p>himself in the position to be hit by the boomerang </p><p>effect." </p><p> </p><p>7.   "Losing the PR Game" </p><p>Columnist Ian MacDonald wrote in the conservative The </p><p>Gazette (3/5): "...Once it made a choice of going to </p><p>the United Nations rather than going it alone on the </p><p>road to Baghdad, the Bush administration was committed </p><p>to a diplomatic end game in the Security Council, a </p><p>game it clearly does not control.... Meantime, world </p><p>opinion counts. The worldwide anti-war demonstrations </p><p>on Feb. 15 were also a reminder of the awesome power of </p><p>the Internet.... Never before has such a well-connected </p><p>movement demonstrated in such impressive numbers around </p><p>the world on a single day.... But the worst moment for </p><p>the Bush administration might have come when Iraqi </p><p>deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz received an audience </p><p>from the pope.... Perhaps the best policy for the </p><p>United States would be to stand by in the Persian Gulf </p><p>and keep squeezing Saddam until, piece by piece, he </p><p>destroys all his weapons of mass destruction.  Then, in </p><p>the immortal words of the late Vermont senator, George </p><p>D. Aiken, in the context of Vietnam, Bush could simply </p><p>declare victory and pull out." </p><p> </p><p>AFGHANISTAN </p><p>8.   "What happened to Afghanistan\'s cash?\' </p><p>The conservative National Post opined (3/6): "When </p><p>Afghanistan\'s Taliban regime fell in late 2001, there </p><p>was a widely shared feeling that this was a victory for </p><p>the Afghan people as much as it was for the United </p><p>States and its allies.... In recent months, however, </p><p>the world\'s attention has become increasingly focused </p><p>on Iraq, and it appears the West is beginning to forget </p><p>about Afghanistan.... Washington dropped the ball on </p><p>Afghanistan a second time, just two weeks ago. In late </p><p>February, Japan played host to a second </p><p>conference on Afghanistan, this time to promote the </p><p>disarmament, demobilization and reintegration...of the </p><p>estimated 800,000 Afghan men who serve in the country\'s </p><p>network of private armies. The United States pledged </p><p>just $14-million for this crucial effort, compared to a </p><p>promise of $42-million from Japan. This is </p><p>unacceptable: The United States is both the </p><p>world\'s richest country and the Western nation with the </p><p>most to lose should Afghanistan collapse or fall back </p><p>under the sway of Taliban-like extremists. </p><p>Washington should be rounding up more generous funding </p><p>for the DDR and other projects. It also must commit </p><p>larger amounts itself. It would be fantastically short- </p><p>sighted for the United States to spend tens of billions </p><p>of dollars fighting a high-tech war in 2001 - only to </p><p>see the benefits squandered because of a lack of follow- </p><p>up humanitarian funding in 2003 and </p><p>beyond.... It should be no small embarrassment to </p><p>Western governments that Iran - a member of George W. </p><p>Bush\'s \'axis of evil\' - has actually turned into one of </p><p>Afghanistan\'s most generous donors.... If the Western </p><p>effort falters, and a political vacuum develops in </p><p>Afghanistan, we can guess what the consequences will </p><p>be.... In 1989, when the Soviet Union was kicked out of </p><p>Afghanistan by U.S.-backed mujahadeen, the United </p><p>States had the chance </p><p>to help Afghanistan rebuild. Instead, Washington </p><p>declared victory and abandoned the country - a move </p><p>that left Afghanistan ripe pickings for the </p><p>Pakistan-backed Taliban a few years later. We cannot </p><p>allow history to repeat itself." </p><p> </p><p>TURKEY </p><p>9.   "Ankara\'s dilemma" </p><p>Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal French- </p><p>language daily Le Devoir (3/4): "The Ankara government </p><p>intends to try again by presenting a second motion to </p><p>Parliament.... To rally all the members of his party, </p><p>Erdogan will obviously have to propose a motion with </p><p>more potential gains than those promised so far by </p><p>Bush. The dilemma is simple: either the government </p><p>gives satisfaction to Washington and immediately </p><p>alienates civil society, or it refuses and its chances </p><p>of joining the European Union sooner will increase to </p><p>Bush\'s great displeasure." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
