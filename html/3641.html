(C) SUMMARY:  DURING 23-24 JULY CONSULTATIONS IN ROME, </p><p>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES PROVIDED A DIVERSE SET OF </p><p>NUANCED RESPONSES TO US CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBLE OVERLAY OF </p><p>THE GPS M-CODE BY GALILEO PRS.  WHILE ITALIAN TECHNICAL </p><p>EXPERTS WORKING ON GALILEO EXPRESSED SOME SYMPATHY TO US </p><p>CONCERNS AND A WILLINGNESS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE, THOSE </p><p>OFFICIALS DEALING WITH GOI GALILEO POLICY RESPONDED IN A MORE </p><p>AMBIGUOUS MANNER.  BUT EVEN THEY ACKNOWLEDGED USG CONCERNS, </p><p>EVEN IF THEY WERE NONCOMMITTAL ON A WAY FORWARD TO FINDING A </p><p>SOLUTION.  ALTHOUGH THE USG GPS DELEGATION MET WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF A VARIETY OF GOI AGENCIES, THE ITALIANS </p><p>HAD CLEARLY COORDINATED THEIR POSITION AS A RESULT OF HAVING </p><p>BEEN BRIEFED IN DETAIL ABOUT A DRAFT REPORT ON GPS-GALILEO </p><p>INTERRELATIONSHIP PRODUCED BY AN AD HOC WORKING GROUP OF THE </p><p>NATO C3 BOARD.  ON THE WHOLE, THE ITALIANS SEEM COMMITTED TO </p><p>GPS-GALILEO INTEROPERABILITY, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THIS </p><p>WILLINGNESS WILL TRANSLATE INTO ITALIAN ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>ACHIEVING A FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF THE M-CODE OVERLAY ISSUE. </p><p> END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) OES/SAT JULIE KARNER AND USNATO DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS ELECTRONICS DIVISION MELVIN FLACK, ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY ESTOFF LORENZO MARTINI, MET WITH OFFICIALS OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MFA), THE ITALIAN MINISTRY OF </p><p>TRANSPORTATION (MOT) AND THE ITALIAN SPACE AGENCY (ASI).  IN </p><p>ALL THREE MEETINGS, THE US DELEGATION MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE </p><p>USG IS NOT OPPOSED TO EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT OF THE GALILEO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04292  01 OF 03  041407Z </p><p>GLOBAL NAVIGATIONAL SATELLITE SYSTEM (GNSS) IN PRINCIPLE BUT </p><p>WISHES TO ASSURE THAT GPS AND GALILEO ARE FULLY INTEROPERABLE </p><p>SO THAT GNSS CIVILIAN CONSUMERS OBTAIN THE BEST POSSIBLE </p><p>SERVICE AT THE LOWEST PRICE.  YET, THE USG CAN NOT ACCEPT THE </p><p>OVERLAY OF A PORTION OF THE U.S. GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM </p><p>(GPS) MILITARY SIGNAL (M-CODE) BY THE PROPOSED GALILEO </p><p>PUBLICLY REGULATED SIGNAL (PRS) BECAUSE OF THE RISKS TO U.S. </p><p>AND NATO MILITARY CAPABILITIES.  THE DELEGATION STRESSED THAT </p><p>WHILE THE USG WAS EAGER TO COLLABORATE WITH THE EUROPEANS ON </p><p>GALILEO INTEROPERABILITY, THE M-CODE OVERLAY ISSUE WOULD BE </p><p>AN OBSTACLE TO FUTURE USG COOPERATION IF IT REMAINS </p><p>UNRESOLVED.  MR. FLACK ANALYZED THE POTENTIAL DETRIMENTAL </p><p>IMPACT TO NATO WAR-FIGHTING CAPABILITIES AND THE RISKS TO </p><p>NATO TROOPS AS A RESULT OF AN M-CODE OVERLAY.  IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>MR. FLACK EXPLAINED THE POTENTIAL HARM TO NATO OBJECTIVES AND </p><p>PERSONNEL IF AN ADVERSARY OBTAINED THE CAPACITY TO USE </p><p>GALILEO SIGNALS FOR ITS OWN WAR-FIGHTING CAPABILITIES. </p><p>CONCERNS OVER THE ROBUSTNESS OF ENCRYPTION TO BE USED BY PRS </p><p>AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A WIDE DISSEMINATION OF ACCESS TO PRS </p><p>AMONG NON-GOVERNMENTAL USERS REPRESENT AN INHERENT RISK OF </p><p>THE PROLIFERATION OF GNSS CAPABILITY TO POSSIBLE NATO </p><p>ADVERSARIES.  BY OVERLAYING THE M-CODE, NATO FORCES WOULD </p><p>DEGRADE THEIR ABILITY TO USE GNSS SIGNALS WHILE TRYING TO </p><p>DENY PRS TO AN ADVERSARY IN THE THEATER OF OPERATIONS.  THE </p><p>ALTERNATIVE, CHANGING THE PRS ENCRYPTION KEYS TO DENY ACCESS </p><p>TO THE ADVERSARY, WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON NATO\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>OBTAIN A RAPID CONSENSUS FOR COOPERATION AMONG ALL THE </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND THE EUROPEAN SPACE </p><p>AGENCY (ESA), SOME OF WHOM ARE NOT NATO MEMBERS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, MS. KARNER EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE EUROPEAN </p><p>COMMITMENT TO INTEROPERABILITY, NOTING AN APPARENT EUROPEAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04292  01 OF 03  041407Z </p><p>PREFERENCE TO PURSUING INDEPENDENCE RATHER THAN </p><p>INTERDEPENDENCE IN THE AREAS OF TIMING, GEODESY AND SIGNAL </p><p>STRUCTURE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) AT THE MFA, THE DELEGATION MET WITH COUNSELOR </p><p>ENRICO GUICCIARDI, HEAD OF SPACE COOPERATION AFFAIRS OF THE </p><p>MFA\'S DIRECTORATE OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION.  GUICCIARDI </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THE USG\'S CONCERNS BUT DID NOT ADDRESS THEM IN </p><p>DETAIL, SHIELDING HIMSELF BEHIND HIS LACK OF TECHNICAL </p><p>EXPERTISE.  HE BELIEVED THAT USG CONCERNS WERE SOMEWHAT </p><p>PREMATURE SINCE GALILEO WAS AT SUCH AN EARLY STAGE OF </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  HE PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE JOINT </p><p>UNDERTAKING BETWEEN ESA AND THE EU TO MANAGE THE PROGRAM. </p><p>THE UNDERLYING THESIS OF HIS PRESENTATION WAS THAT THE M-CODE </p><p>OVERLAY ISSUE COULD BE ADDRESSED COMPREHENSIVELY ONCE THE </p><p>EUROPEANS HAD WORKED OUT ALL THE WRINKLES IN THE OPERATION OF </p><p>THE JOINT UNDERTAKING.  WITHOUT PROVIDING A COMMITMENT, </p><p>GUICCIARDI SEEMED AMENABLE TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE BUT ADMITTED THAT HE WAS NOT THE KEY GOI DECISION-MAKER </p><p>ON GALILEO. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ON 24 JULY, THE DELEGATION MET WITH COUNSELOR RENATO </p><p>LIBASSI, A SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORTATION </p><p>AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE GOI\'S INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP ON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5851 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04292  02 OF 03  041408Z </p><p>ACTION OES-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   NASA-01 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PM-00    ACE-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------E24E86  041412Z /38 </p><p>R 041346Z SEP 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5691 </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>INFO EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 004292 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/SAT/JULIE KARNER </p><p>NATO PASS SES-4 FOR MELVIN FLACK </p><p>USDOC PASS OFFICE OF SPACE COMMERCIALIZATION </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/11/2007 </p><p>TAGS: TSPA, TSPL, ECON, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: GPS/GALILEO CONSULTATIONS IN ITALY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04292  02 OF 03  041408Z </p><p> </p><p>GALILEO.  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE US DELEGATION\'S CONCERNS, </p><p>LIBASSI DID NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS THEIR MERITS.  INSTEAD, HE </p><p>PROVIDED A NUANCED RESPONSE THAT REITERATED AN ITALIAN </p><p>COMMITMENT TO AN OPEN US-EUROPEAN DIALOGUE WITH THE GOAL OF </p><p>ACHIEVING GPS-GALILEO INTERDEPENDENCE WHILE MAINTAINING EU </p><p>SOLIDARITY.  LIBASSI STRESSED THAT ITALY DID NOT WANT TO </p><p>WEAKEN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC) BY PURSUING A SEPARATE </p><p>GALILEO DIALOGUE WITH THE UNITED STATES AND THAT ITALY </p><p>INTENDS TO GIVE ITS "FULL, LOYAL SUPPORT TO THE EC" IN THIS </p><p>MATTER.  WHILE HE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN TO A NATO-EU DIALOGUE ON </p><p>THE M-CODE OVERLAY ISSUE, HE INDICATED THAT THE US-EU </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS SHOULD TAKE PRIMACY OVER ANY NATO-EU DISCUSSION. </p><p> ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT DISPUTE THE MERITS OF THE CONCERNS OF </p><p>THE US OR OTHER NATO MEMBERS ON M-CODE OVERLAY, HE EXPRESSED </p><p>A CONCERN ABOUT THE USE OF SECURITY ISSUES AS A COVER FOR </p><p>COMMERCIAL OR POLITICAL OBJECTIVES.  SPECIFICALLY, LIBASSI </p><p>DID NOT WANT TO SEE THE OVERLAY ISSUE USED BY UNNAMED EU </p><p>MEMBER STATES TO USE THEIR DUAL MEMBERSHIP IN NATO AS A MEANS </p><p>TO REOPEN AGREEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED WITHIN THE EU </p><p>TRANSPORT COUNCIL IN ORDER TO RENEGOTIATE BETTER TERMS. </p><p>(EMBASSY COMMENT:  HE MAY HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO THE </p><p>COMPETITION FROM GERMANY TO BE THE SITE OF THE FUTURE </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE SEAT OF GALILEO.  ALTHOUGH THE GERMANS WERE </p><p>LATECOMERS IN JOINING GALILEO, THEY ARE AGGRESSIVELY SEEKING </p><p>TO HAVE THE GALILEO HEADQUARTERS BASED IN GERMANY ACCORDING </p><p>TO A AUGUST 21 CONVERSATION BETWEEN ESTOFF AND THE GERMAN </p><p>EMBASSY COUNSELOR FOR SCIENCE AFFAIRS JEN-PETER VOSS </p><p>(PROTECT).  GUICCIARDI MENTIONED ITALIAN-GERMAN FRICTION OVER </p><p>THIS ISSUE BUT DID NOT GO INTO DETAIL.  END COMMENT)  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THERE WAS A "STRONG POLITICAL WILL" WITHIN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04292  02 OF 03  041408Z </p><p>EU TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE UNITED STATES OVER GALILEO AND </p><p>IMPLIED THAT FULL US ENGAGEMENT IN GPS-GALILEO </p><p>INTEROPERABILITY "MIGHT AFFECT DESIGN."  HE NOTED THAT THE </p><p>EUROPEANS WILL LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT THE ISSUES OF ACCESS </p><p>CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF PRS ENCRYPTION.  ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>CLAIMED NOT TO HAVE SEEN A COPY OF THE NATO C3 BOARD\'S </p><p>WORKING GROUP\'S DRAFT REPORTON GPS-GALILEO </p><p>INTERRELATIONSHIP, HE ADMITTED TOHAVING BEEN BRIEFED ON ITS </p><p>CONTENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  LIBASSI MADE AN OFFHAND COMMENT REGARDING THE ROLE </p><p>OF CHINA, WHICH ALLOWED THE US DELEGATION THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>ASK FOR CLARIFICATION ON THE NATURE OF CHINESE PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN GALILEO THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENT WITH ESA. </p><p>LIBASSI RESPONDED THAT THE ROLE OF ESA\'S NON-EU COLLABORATORS </p><p>SUCH AS CHINA COULD PLAY IN GALILEO HAD NOT BEEN DECIDED.  HE </p><p>SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THAT EXTENSIVE CHINESE PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>GALILEO WOULD HEIGHTEN US CONCERNS OVER THE POTENTIAL OF </p><p>NON-NATO COUNTRIES TO HAVE A DE FACTO VETO POWER OVER NATO </p><p>DECISION-MAKING IN A CRISIS THROUGH PRS OVERLAY OF THE </p><p>M-CODE.  IN ADDITION, HE MADE AN OBLIQUE COMMENT REGARDING </p><p>"NATO BECOMING AN ASSISTANCE GROUP" OVER TIME.  IT WAS NOT </p><p>CLEAR WHAT HE MEANT BY THIS STATEMENT, AND THE US DELEGATION </p><p>DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESS HIM FOR CLARIFICATION. </p><p>(EMBASSY COMMENT:  WE VIEW THIS STATEMENT TO REFLECT </p><p>LIBASSI\'S PERSONAL OPINION ONLY.  HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY </p><p>COMPETENCY IN NATO AFFAIRS, SINCE HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY DIRECT </p><p>ROLE IN ITALIAN NATO POLICYMAKING, NOR DOES HE SEEM TO HAVE </p><p>ANY EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) AT ASI, THE DELEGATION MET WITH THE DIRECTOR OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04292  02 OF 03  041408Z </p><p>EXTERNAL RELATIONS, ROMEO PERNICE, AND THE TWO CHIEF ASI </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES TO THE ESA AND EU TECHNICAL WORKING GROUPS ON </p><p>GALILEO, DR. FRANCO MARCONICCHIO AND DR. FRANCO MARUCCI. </p><p>MARCONICCHIO AND MARUCCI ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE ITALIAN </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO THE TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT OF GALILEO.  THIS </p><p>DISCUSSION WAS MUCH MORE OPEN AND DIRECT WITH REGARD TO THE </p><p>ITALIAN RESPONSE.  THE ASI REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE WHOLE, </p><p>EXPRESSED A SINCERE DESIRE TO COOPERATE WITH THE UNITED </p><p>STATES ON GPS-GALILEO INTEROPERABILITY.  MARCONICCHIO, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, ASKED IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE </p><p>US-EUROPEAN TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS ON THE NON-PRS GALILEO </p><p>SERVICES AND SEPARATE THEM FROM THE M-CODE OVERLAY ISSUE. </p><p>WHILE THE USG PLANS TO GO FORWARD WITH GPS-GALILEO TECHNICAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS, THE M-CODE OVERLAY ISSUE, IF IT REMAINS </p><p>UNRESOLVED, WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME AN IMPEDIMENT TO FUTURE </p><p>USG COOPERATION WITH GALILEO.  FROM ASI\'S PERSPECTIVE, ON THE </p><p>WHOLE, US-EUROPEAN TECHNICAL COOPERATION ON GPS-GALILEO ARE </p><p>PROCEEDING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  ASI IS COMMITTED TO </p><p>COMPLETE INTEROPERABILITY WITH GPS AS BEING A FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>GOAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GALILEO.  THE ASI TEAM NOTED THAT </p><p>A PRELIMINARY SYSTEM DESIGN REVIEW FOR GALILEO WAS COMPLETED </p><p>THE WEEK OF 14-20 JULY 2002 BUT THE EXACT CAPABILITIES OF PRS </p><p>HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED.

THE ASI TEAM ALSO ADMITTED TO HAVING BEEN </p><p>BRIEFED ON THE CONTENTS OF THE NATO C3 REPORT BEFORE THEIR </p><p>MEETING WITH THE US DELEGATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.

THE GOI DOES NOT SEEM </p><p>TO HAVE A DEEPLY VESTED INTEREST IN PRS OVERLAYING THE GPS </p><p>M-CODE ISSUE BUT DECLINED TO COMMIT OPENLY TO SEEKING A </p><p>RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUE, OSTENSIBLY TO MAINTAIN EU UNITY. </p><p>THE ASI TECHNICAL EXPERTS SEEMED TO BE THE MOST WILLING TO </p><p>SEEK A RESOLUTION, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE DECISION TO </p><p>OVERLAY THE M-CODE IS BEING DRIVEN BY POLITICAL RATHER THAN </p><p>TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS, AT LEAST IN ITALY.  UNFORTUNATELY, </p><p>IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE DELEGATION TO MEET WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ITALIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE, WHICH </p><p>MIGHT HAVE A MORE VESTED INTEREST IN THE SANCTITY OF THE </p><p>M-CODE.
