<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001215 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 2/24/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS, SAME CONCLUSION:  THE USG </p><p>MUST PUSH NOW TO SOLVE THE ISRAELI/PALESTINIAN CONFLICT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  On February 24th PolOff met together with </p><p>former senator Hosni Ayesh, a Palestinian-Jordanian, and </p><p>former parliamentarian Dr. Ahmad Ennab, an East-Banker.  The </p><p>two men differed in their background, reasoning and style of </p><p>discourse.  Both however, arrived at the same conclusion: </p><p>The US should not expect support from the Arab world on </p><p>anything, including a war against Saddam Hussein, until it </p><p>moves forward to help achieve peace in the </p><p>Israeli/Palestinian conflict.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>AYESH:  GIVE US JUSTICE IN PALESTINE </p><p>AND I\'LL MARCH WITH YOU INTO BAGHDAD </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Despite PolOff\'s attempts to discuss the newly-formed </p><p>Center for Human Rights, Ayesh immediately veered into a </p><p>twenty-minute invective on USG policy failures.  PolOff (and </p><p>Dr. Ennab) were helpless to steer the discourse.  Much of </p><p>Ayesh\'s commentary was polemic and ad hominem; why, he asked, </p><p>are Americans not concerned that USG policy is now directed </p><p>by former "Netanyahu hawks"; why are Arabs unsafe in America </p><p>now with "thousands" rounded up; why not target the human </p><p>rights record of Saudi Arabia before Iraq...  As the smoke </p><p>cleared, Ayesh said he would gladly join an American army </p><p>marching into Baghdad if America adopted a "fair" policy on </p><p>the Israel/Palestinian crisis.  This, he exclaimed, is the </p><p>view of most Palestinians. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>ENNAB:  YOU WALKED ON THE MOON BUT </p><p>NOW YOU CANNOT EVEN WALK ON THE EARTH </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Dr. Ennab delivered his arguments with composure and </p><p>in a somewhat detached fashion.  America is the greatest </p><p>power on Earth for many reasons, he said.  "You walked on the </p><p>moon," he said softly.  But these days, "you cannot even walk </p><p>on Earth without angering the rest of the world."  As Ayesh </p><p>left the room to take a telephone call, Dr. Ennab told </p><p>PolOff, "Personally I\'m for the war.  We need the change and </p><p>it would be probably be good for Jordan.  But, you\'ll never </p><p>win the Arab street on anything, not even on support against </p><p>a guy like Saddam, until you work out the Palestinian </p><p>problem."  Palestinians care about their brethren while other </p><p>Arabs care about refugee inflows resulting from Israeli </p><p>polices, he said.  He noted that while Saddam is not popular, </p><p>the Iraqi regime has effectively managed to convey support </p><p>for Palestinians while portraying itself as a "victim" of the </p><p>very same western "humiliation" that has beset the </p><p>Palestinians.  The result here is a shift in focus away from </p><p>Saddam\'s crimes and toward the motives of the USG. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.(C)  Ayesh and Dr. Ennab, long-time friends, faithfully </p><p>articulated their "East Banker" and "Palestinian" </p><p>perspectives.  Despite different starting points, ultimately </p><p>the two arrive at a conclusion which is held nearly </p><p>universally here:  the US must move forward on the </p><p>Israeli/Palestinian crisis before it will be able to quell </p><p>growing anti-American sentiment, much less win acceptance of </p><p>the need for military action in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) BIO NOTES.  Hosni Ayesh is a former senator originally </p><p>from Nablus.  Prior to his appointment to the senate he was a </p><p>teacher (in Nablus), lecturer and author of many articles and </p><p>a book on democracy in the Arab world.  On February 18, he </p><p>was selected to be on the Council of Trustees for the newly </p><p>formed National Center for Human Rights.  Ayesh occasionally </p><p>appears on Al-Jazeera and contributes to Al-Rai newspaper. </p><p>He pushed his points aggressively with PolOff.  Dr. Ennab is </p><p>an East-Banker and former parliamentarian from Ajlun.  He is </p><p>now a retired dermatologist, and is a long-time embassy </p><p>contact.  Dr. Ennab was composed, willing to listen, and more </p><p>at ease when discussing the controversial topics of Iraq and </p><p>the Israel/Palestinian conflict. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
