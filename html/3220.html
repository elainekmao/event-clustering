<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 003549 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, KPAO, PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSABEEL: UNDERSTANDING JORDAN\'S PREEMINENT </p><p>ISLAMIST WEEKLY </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2559 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Islamist publication Assabeel ("the way" or "the </p><p>path") is Jordan\'s most important weekly newspaper.  Its </p><p>circulation is small compared to that of the daily </p><p>newspapers, but it has grown recently when other Jordanian </p><p>weeklies have not.  Insiders aver that the paper seeks to </p><p>convey "quality information beneficial to readers."  They </p><p>style the paper as a critical opposition mouthpiece, </p><p>positively directed at supporting reform in Jordan through </p><p>conventional and democratic means.  The paper, they say, is </p><p>both lauded and reviled because it stakes out strong, </p><p>principled positions on issues.  Insiders at Assabeel claim </p><p>the paper is independent.  Other members of the media scoff </p><p>at such claims of independence, and even suggest that </p><p>Assabeel\'s staff reports to Jordanian intelligence.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>HISTORY, CIRCULATION, AND READERSHIP </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Members of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) founded </p><p>Assabeel in 1993, shortly after the advent of the MB\'s </p><p>political arm, the Islamic Action Front (IAF).  Assabeel rose </p><p>out of the ashes of an "official" MB newspaper, Al Ribat </p><p>("the tether").  According to Sa\'ud Abu Mahfuz, Assabeel\'s </p><p>General Manager and a member of the MB, Al Ribat failed in </p><p>its second year because the MB controlled it too tightly. </p><p>Abu Mahfuz claims Assabeel is, by contrast, independent. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Abu Mahfuz reports that the paper\'s circulation has </p><p>doubled to about 17,000 copies since September 2000.  (Note: </p><p>A former editor ousted from Assabeel in 1996 insists it has </p><p>merely maintained circulation at 5-7000 copies over the past </p><p>two years, and was in steady decline before that.)  Assabeel </p><p>employs fourteen people besides Abu Mahfuz; seven are </p><p>journalists and the other seven work as secretaries, computer </p><p>technicians, and office staff.  The paper meets its operating </p><p>expenses through sales revenues. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to Abu Mahfuz, most copies of Assabeel are </p><p>purchased by women who take the paper home to large families. </p><p> In addition, copies placed in any of Jordan\'s more than 3000 </p><p>mosques may be read by scores of people.  For this reason, </p><p>Assabeel uses a large multiplier to extrapolate an estimated </p><p>readership of 170,000 from circulation figures.  Though one </p><p>former parliamentarian surmises that Assabeel\'s hardcopy </p><p>readership is confined to MB members, Assabeel insiders claim </p><p>many party leaders, ministry officials, diplomats, doctors, </p><p>educators, and leaders at mosques and churches read their </p><p>paper.  (Indeed, the Political and Public Affairs sections </p><p>receive Assabeel weekly.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Assabeel\'s website reportedly has 1,000,000 hits </p><p>monthly from expatriate Jordanians seeking an opposition </p><p>viewpoint on issues within Jordan, government officials, and </p><p>others in countries throughout the world.  Thousands of hits </p><p>originate from the United States. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>THE SECRET OF OUR SUCCESS: CREDIBILITY, FAMILY VALUES, </p><p>"NATIONAL" APPEAL, AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Abu Mahfuz attributes Assabeel\'s success to its </p><p>credibility and authenticity as a news source.  He even </p><p>claims the paper presents U.S. views and positions evenly, </p><p>and promised the paper would support Bush\'s June 24th speech </p><p>if it turned out to be "fair."  Abu Mahfuz said Assabeel\'s </p><p>readership appreciates its "principled" opposition to the GOJ </p><p>in instances like the sedition case of former MP Toujan </p><p>Faisal (reftel).  Assabeel openly criticized Faisal\'s </p><p>imprisonment, even though Islamists had been the object of </p><p>Faisal\'s vitriol in the past.  According to Abu Mahfuz, the </p><p>fundamental unfairness of Faisal\'s imprisonment made Faisal\'s </p><p>prior invective superfluous. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Abu Mahfuz also claims readers are drawn to Assabeel </p><p>because of its conservative "family" orientation.  For </p><p>example, unlike other Jordanian weeklies, Assabeel does not </p><p>publish photos of women passing for Arab-World correlatives </p><p>of Britain\'s "page three" girls.  Assabeel bars advertising </p><p>by establishments (e.g., banks and night clubs) promoting </p><p>practices (e.g., usury and drinking) at odds with </p><p>conservative Muslim ideology. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Abu Mahfuz points to Assabeel\'s breadth of coverage as </p><p>another reason for its increased popularity.  A typical issue </p><p>contains several pages of news and features treating a broad </p><p>range of topics through the "eyes of Islam," whereas the </p><p>content of other weeklies is more thin.  Three of nine </p><p>columnists at Assabeel are at least nominally Christian, </p><p>though the practical effect of this on the paper\'s content is </p><p>hard to detect.  Regardless, Abu Mahfuz characterizes the </p><p>newspaper as "national" (not merely Muslim) in its appeal. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Abu Mahfuz acknowledges that regional developments </p><p>help account for heightened sales.  Circulation has generally </p><p>increased throughout the Intifada -- while other weeklies </p><p>have fizzled -- and it spikes in response to specific events </p><p>on the West Bank.  For example, Abu Mahfuz says bloody </p><p>photographs depicting Palestinian suffering in Jenin during </p><p>Israel\'s April insurgency greatly boosted circulation.  Abu </p><p>Mahfuz asserts that people are attracted to Assabeel\'s </p><p>coverage because it is moderate and discourages violence, yet </p><p>at the same time says some of the photographs it publishes </p><p>incite "revolutionary" sentiment.  The paper has also given </p><p>positive coverage to Palestinian suicide bombers. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment.  Assabeel also panders to popular </p><p>anti-Israel and anti-U.S. sentiment in other subtle (and not </p><p>so subtle) ways.  Assabeel stories, headlines, and captions </p><p>consistently use pejorative labels for Israeli officials, </p><p>e.g., "the criminal Peres" and "the terrorist Sharon."  It </p><p>frequently runs lurid banner headlines (in red ink) calling </p><p>attention to the latest Israeli "atrocity" or Bin Laden </p><p>statement.  However, Public Affairs has obtained relatively </p><p>fair and frequent coverage in Assabeel for U.S. speaker </p><p>programs and Embassy activities.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT: INFORMAL PRESS RESTRICTIONS, MARKET </p><p>LIMITS, AND REPORTING QUALITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Abu Mahfuz identifies two factors "limiting" </p><p>Assabeel.  First, like all media in Jordan, there are </p><p>unwritten restrictions on Assabeel\'s freedom of expression, </p><p>which Assabeel observes in order to avoid "problems" with the </p><p>GOJ.  Assabeel claims to support positive change through </p><p>conventional means, and does not publish material aimed at </p><p>undermining the Hashemite regime, personally attacking GOJ </p><p>officials, or exploiting societal fault-lines (e.g., </p><p>East-Bank/West-Bank tensions and Muslim/Christian religious </p><p>differences).  (Note: On a personal level, Abu Mahfuz </p><p>considers the Hashemite regime "an evil blight, forced on </p><p>Jordan by colonial powers, in an otherwise holy land.")  By </p><p>observing limits, the paper retains the ability to criticize </p><p>the GOJ on human rights issues and other topics. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Second, Abu Mahfuz notes that Assabeel cannot -- at </p><p>least in hardcopy form -- expand beyond its small Jordanian </p><p>market due to the prohibitively high transactions costs of </p><p>selling in other countries.  (Note:  Though Abu Mahfuz did </p><p>not mention it, political sensitivities in other countries </p><p>would also limit hardcopy distribution.) </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Sources outside Assabeel criticize its reporting. </p><p>The former Assabeel editor describes the current crop of </p><p>Assabeel journalists as bright, but young and inexperienced </p><p>(because, he says, few experienced reporters belong to the </p><p>MB).  There is also a perception that Assabeel\'s treatment of </p><p>international issues is especially weak.  Assabeel uses the </p><p>internet, releases from Hamas media offices, and </p><p>sensationalist media outlets to cover external issues.  Given </p><p>Assabeel\'s limitations as a raw news source, one contact </p><p>explains that the paper survives only because its opinion and </p><p>editorial pieces are marginally better than those of other </p><p>weeklies. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>THE QUESTION OF INDEPENDENCE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Assabeel\'s General Manager claims the paper is an </p><p>independent publication, rather than "a bird crushed in the </p><p>hands of the IAF or the Muslim Brotherhood."  This may be </p><p>true in the limited sense that the IAF/MB does not own </p><p>Assabeel and the paper operates out of separate offices. </p><p>Moreover, the paper criticizes the IAF on occasion.  For </p><p>example, Abu Mahfuz says Assabeel blamed the IAF for weaker </p><p>than expected showings in student council elections held at </p><p>some universities.  Moreover, the paper reportedly criticized </p><p>the IAF\'s boycott of the 1997 parliamentary elections.  Abu </p><p>Mahfuz promises Assabeel will cover debate over the IAF\'s </p><p>participation in anticipated parliamentary elections, but </p><p>only after the GOJ commits to a date for elections. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The former Assabeel editor agrees that Assabeel\'s </p><p>content is not determined by the IAF or the MB.  However, he </p><p>says the content is controlled by Assabeel\'s founders (four </p><p>Palestinian Muslims and a Palestinian Christian), who use the </p><p>paper to air their pro-Hamas/anti-Palestinian Authority </p><p>viewpoint under the cover of an organ most associate only </p><p>with the IAF/MB.  Sources note that the views expressed by </p><p>Christian writers on Assabeel\'s staff do not differ </p><p>appreciably from Islamist views, so that the paper does not </p><p>present a distinct Christian outlook.  Members of the media </p><p>deride claims of Assabeel\'s independence, suggesting that </p><p>Assabeel\'s staff reports to Jordan\'s General Intelligence </p><p>Directorate. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) The Islamists who run Assabeel portray themselves -- </p><p>and may see themselves -- as uncompromising </p><p>"uber-journalists" wrapped in a righteous cause.  They seem </p><p>convinced that they conscientiously express their viewpoint </p><p>in accordance with the highest professional standards, and </p><p>appear to believe that the "truth" of their message fully </p><p>explains Assabeel\'s popularity.  But in Jordan, where </p><p>opposition views are not always easy to air, at least in the </p><p>media, some people may gravitate towards whatever opposition </p><p>exists whether or not they accept all that the opposition </p><p>stands for.  Opposition dynamics -- combined with Assabeel\'s </p><p>clear anti-Israel bias -- help explain why the paper is as </p><p>popular as it now is, and also why it is not embraced more </p><p>broadly. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
