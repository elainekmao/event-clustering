<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 RANGOON 000258 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 2/26/13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PREF, KISL, BM, UNHCR, Human Rights, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: MUSLIM REPRESSION AND RESENTMENT NEAR BURMA\'S </p><p>BORDER WITH BANGLADESH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ. REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  The Burmese regime\'s repression of the </p><p>mostly Muslim population of northern Rakhine State, located </p><p>along the border with Bangladesh, is breeding resentment and </p><p>poverty.  DCM visited the area in mid-February as part of a </p><p>trip to the region organized by UNHCR for diplomats.  UNHCR\'s </p><p>protective services are limiting the oppression and its </p><p>coordination of NGO and other UN agency projects is providing </p><p>the only development effort in the region.  The security </p><p>forces in northern Rakhine State, reportedly numbering 8,000, </p><p>are an extractive presence, largely self-financing and/or </p><p>self-enriching.  Incidents of forced labor have fallen due to </p><p>the completion of a UN-supported gravel road that has reduced </p><p>the security forces\' need for forced porterage to isolated </p><p>outposts.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) POOR, CROWDED, AND ISOLATED:  The three townships </p><p>(akin to counties in the U.S.) nearest the Bangladesh border </p><p>in Rakhine State have a population of 800,000, the vast </p><p>majority of whom are Bengali-speaking Muslims.  About a </p><p>quarter of a million people in this area have returned to </p><p>Burma after fleeing as refugees to Bangladesh in the 1990s. </p><p>By almost any socio-economic measure this is Burma\'s poorest </p><p>and most crowded rural region--the UN reports 61% of children </p><p>are malnourished and 35% are severely stunted.  The area </p><p>consists of mountainous peninsulas flanked by tidal estuaries </p><p>that are too brackish for irrigation.  The 18 feet of rain </p><p>per year falls in 5 months, meaning there are two seasons: </p><p>dust and mud.  There is no motorable road connection with </p><p>Bangladesh--the only official entry point from Bangladesh is </p><p>the estuary port of Maungdaw. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) NO RECENT INSURGENT ACTIVITY:  According to </p><p>residents, NGO and UN expatriates, and UN and NGO local staff </p><p>members intimately familiar with the region, there has been </p><p>no serious insurgent activity in northern Rakhine State for </p><p>several years (notwithstanding insurgent press releases). </p><p>One source claimed the last major incident was in 1994.  A </p><p>French NGO worker related an incident from 2001 in which four </p><p>members of the security forces were murdered at night in </p><p>their camp.  He believed it had something to do with forced </p><p>prostitution or trafficking in women and was probably not </p><p>insurgent related.  After the murders, her continued, the </p><p>security forces rounded up the inhabitants of a nearby </p><p>village and penned them in a field for two days with no food </p><p>or water.  Two toddlers, who were left at the village, </p><p>reportedly died.  Other sources said that occasional slit </p><p>throats or stabbings are sometimes vaguely attributed to "the </p><p>RSO" (the Rohingya Solidarity Organization, commonly used to </p><p>refer to any Muslim insurgents), but are likely the result of </p><p>local resentments and outraged husbands or fathers.  "RSO" </p><p>members (i.e., militant Muslim refugees) total about 200 </p><p>individuals, according to one informed local estimate. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) RAPACIOUS SECURITY FORCES:  UN sources report that </p><p>there are some 8,000 security force personnel occupying about </p><p>80 sites in the three townships.  Most are members of the </p><p>hybrid Burmese border patrol known as NaSaKa (the Burmese </p><p>acronym for Border Immigration HQ).  Nearly every bridge, </p><p>tunnel, intersection, hamlet, and government building is </p><p>"guarded" by a detachment of armed men.  We met with the </p><p>notorious NaSaKa commander Aung Ngwe who is such an egregious </p><p>abuser of human rights, even by Burmese military standards, </p><p>that he was previously ordered back to Rangoon for a sharp </p><p>reprimand.  However, he is back commanding the border region, </p><p>with his actions unchanged, according to locals. </p><p> </p><p>4  (C) SECURITY FORCES SELF-FINANCING, SELF-ENRICHING:  UN </p><p>and NGO staffers say the security forces extract revenue and </p><p>labor from the local population at every opportunity, in </p><p>part, they contend, because the SPDC has made the conscious </p><p>decision to make security operations there self-financing. </p><p>This approach has the added "benefit" of dampening the pull </p><p>factor from even more-crowded nearby areas of Bangladesh, </p><p>they add.  For example, Aung Ngwe has licensed nearly every </p><p>conceivable economic activity to a crony, friend, or partner. </p><p> Poor woodcutters must sell their daily cuttings to the </p><p>monopoly licensee for 8 kyat a bundle; Aung Ngwe\'s buddy </p><p>turns around and sells it for 20 kyat.  We drove through a </p><p>large GOB cashew plantation.  Aung Ngwe personally pockets </p><p>the proceeds from the cashew nuts, we were told, but allows </p><p>the villagers who pick the crop to keep some of the cashew </p><p>fruit.  Every checkpoint extracts a 50 kyat fee or a pack of </p><p>cigarettes from the cargo bicycles that move rice and </p><p>provisions through the township.  Aung Ngwe even sold the </p><p>right to charge tolls on a bridge connecting the port of </p><p>Maungdaw to the center of town--the tollbooth has since been </p><p>removed after UN complaints.  Muslims routinely must bribe </p><p>officials to travel within or between the three townships. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  HUMAN RIGHTS:  The UNHCR documents reports of </p><p>incidents of forced labor and forced contributions in the </p><p>area.  The number of incidents has fallen in 2002, the UNHCR </p><p>explains, not because of a change in GOB policy or action, </p><p>but because of the completion of a road financed by a WFP </p><p>food-for-work project and the Japanese NGO BAJ.  This road </p><p>allows NaSaKa easier motorized access to hitherto isolated </p><p>outposts close to the Bangladesh border and has reduced the </p><p>need for porterage services of the locals. </p><p> </p><p>--  At one village the Australian DCM was slipped a note by a </p><p>person requesting protection/support from GOB oppression.  A </p><p>UNHCR staffer said, "Bad news.  MI minders saw the note being </p><p>passed, so now we\'ll have to visit this village two or three </p><p>times a week for the next couple of months to make sure that </p><p>everybody here is ok." </p><p> </p><p>-- DCM spoke with one landless Muslim man who, amid tears, </p><p>explained that his daughter was in jail and he had no money </p><p>to pay for transport to the township capital, bribe the </p><p>soldiers at the numerous checkpoints along the way, or to </p><p>bribe the judge.  His daughter had accused the GOB-appointed </p><p>village headman of sexual assault, as had another young woman </p><p>in the village.  When NaSaka commander Aung Ngwe heard of the </p><p>accusation against the village headman (his friend), he </p><p>ordered the two women arrested.  The village headman is also </p><p>in jail, but has access to resources to sway the outcome of </p><p>proceedings, our contacts explained. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) RETURNEES AND UNHCR:  About 25 refugees per week are </p><p>returning from Bangladesh--all by boat through the river port </p><p>of Maungdaw.  UNHCR estimates approximately 5,000 will be </p><p>willing and able to return by time of the closure of the </p><p>UNHCR repatriation program at the end of June.  This means </p><p>that weekly returnee rates will need to increase at least </p><p>ten-fold to meet this deadline.  Once out of the repatriation </p><p>business, UNHCR staffers admitted that they will be </p><p>hard-pressed to justify the continuation of their programs in </p><p>the border area, which in reality are a mix of UNDP-type </p><p>development activities and normal ICRC protective services. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) WHAT\'S IN A NAME?:  When returning refugees are </p><p>processed at Maungdaw UNHCR helps them fill out the </p><p>immigration and customs forms.  Returnees are asked to </p><p>declare their ethnicity, nationality, and religion.  The </p><p>standard and approved method by which UNHCR helps fill out </p><p>the cards yields the following:  Ethnicity - Bengali; </p><p>Nationality - Myanmar; Religion - Muslim.  While the </p><p>returnees are not considered citizens of Myanmar, they are </p><p>apparently considered nationals. </p><p> </p><p>--  DCM did not once hear the word "Rohingya" used by anyone </p><p>to describe Muslim Bengali-speakers.  Rather, "Muslim" is </p><p>used.  One Muslim local staffer explained he had once written </p><p>Rohingya on a form, but was told by the local authorities not </p><p>to use it. </p><p> </p><p>--  "RSO" is commonly used to describe any Muslim insurgents, </p><p>frequently accompanied by a vague wave in the direction of </p><p>the Bangladeshi border. </p><p> </p><p>--  Buddhist Rakhine-speakers are usually called Rakhines. </p><p> </p><p>--  Arakan, another term for the state, people, and language, </p><p>was used in private conversation by pro-democracy individuals </p><p>in the ancient Arakan capital of Mrauk-Oo and elsewhere. </p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi and her allies in the Arakan League for </p><p>Democracy also use "Arakan." </p><p> </p><p>--  Almost everybody used Yangon and Myanmar vice Rangoon and </p><p>Burma, but quite a few people used Burmese (vice Myanmar) </p><p>when referring to the language and "Myanmar people" when </p><p>referring to the Burmese nationality.  Several Arakanese </p><p>voiced lingering resentment at the destruction of the capital </p><p>city of Mrauk-Oo by Burmese invaders in 1754. </p><p> </p><p>-- Nobody used the older term "Akyab" for the city of Sittwe, </p><p>the capital of Rakhine State. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE STATUS OF ISLAM:  The practice of Islam is not </p><p>restricted, commander Aung Ngwe assured us.  Indeed, we saw </p><p>many Muslims worshipping throughout the area.  One catch is </p><p>that the authorities prohibit the construction or repair of </p><p>mosques.  As a result, most mosques are in severe disrepair. </p><p>In Maungdaw, the largest city in the (almost completely </p><p>Muslim) township of 431,000 people, the central mosque has no </p><p>roof.  On a Muslim holiday we witnessed thousands of </p><p>worshippers crowded into what in effect was an courtyard </p><p>enclosed by a brick wall painted green--and this in a city </p><p>that gets 18 feet of rain per year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) INDIAN PLANS IN THE AREA:  During the many hours we </p><p>spent traveling on the broad rivers of northern Rakhine, the </p><p>Indian ambassador detailed an approved GOI-GOB plan to </p><p>connect NE India to the Bay of Bengal via a road-river link </p><p>utilizing the Kaladan River.  India and Burma would dredge </p><p>and, where needed, widen, the Kaladan River to enable cargo </p><p>ships to ply most of the distance between Sittwe and the </p><p>Indian border.  The northern-most link would entail about 40 </p><p>miles of blacktopped road.  A cargo terminal would be built </p><p>at Sittwe and at the navigable northern end of the Kaladan </p><p>River, he reported.  This route will cut by three-quarters </p><p>the transport time for goods between NE India and Calcutta, </p><p>he claimed.  Survey and planning has commenced, he added, </p><p>with the project to be concluded "in about six years." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT:  The GOB policies in northern Rakhine are a </p><p>wonderful example of how not to win friends and influence </p><p>people.  The seething resentment is almost palpable and is, </p><p>in fact, visible.  As we traveled by boat up the rivers and </p><p>estuaries from central to northern Rakhine State, the UNHCR </p><p>staff suggested that we note the reaction of people along the </p><p>riverbanks to our presence.  Sure enough, during the first </p><p>part of the voyage people called out, smiled, and waved as we </p><p>sped past.  Further on, folks wouldn\'t even return a wave, </p><p>and often stepped back into the brush as we approached.  The </p><p>change occurred about the same place Buddhist temples stopped </p><p>appearing in villages.  The Muslim-majority townships felt </p><p>like an area suffering from an oppressive occupier, with </p><p>Islam the prime uniting and potentially mobilizing force. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
