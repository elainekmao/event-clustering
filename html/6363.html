<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001631 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH KURDS: "WHY DO YOU NEED TURKEY?" </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1624 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1470 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 1341 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by PolCouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In March 13 conversation with poloffs, a close Embassy </p><p>contact and opposition CHP M.P. discussed Kurdish </p><p>perspectives of a possible operation in Iraq.  The M.P., a </p><p>leader of the Kurdish Dostki tribe with extensive political </p><p>ties in Turkey\'s southeast, tribal ties in Iraq, and previous </p><p>service in Parliament, lamented U.S. reliance on Turkey for </p><p>any operation in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) He explained to us that none of his constituents or </p><p>family members wants Turkish troops to deploy to Iraq.  They </p><p>fear an intensifying crackdown on Kurds on both sides of the </p><p>border, a consequence of "the Turkish State\'s racist </p><p>underpinnings." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On the other hand, Kurds, he emphasized, will welcome </p><p>U.S. troops: "we realize that the U.S. is our only friend in </p><p>the world."  Numerous protesters are out on the street </p><p>chanting "Savasa Hayir" -- no to war, he noted.  "I say, </p><p>\'Savasa Evet\'" (Yes to War). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) When poloffs tested him by noting their respect for </p><p>Turkey in general and shared USG-GOT interests, our contact\'s </p><p>face froze in a way we have seen countless times in </p><p>discussing Turkey with Turkish Kurds.  "Why do you need </p><p>Turkey?" he asked.  The Turkish State has a woeful reputation </p><p>among Kurds everywhere, he noted.  Turkish support for an </p><p>operation would, therefore, actually harm rather than enhance </p><p>USG equities in Iraq and elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Our contact is concerned that an operation in Iraq </p><p>will provide an excuse for the Turkish State to re-impose </p><p>OHAL (State of Emergency) or some other quasi-martial law </p><p>regime in Turkey\'s Southeast.  A legal expert on State </p><p>Security Courts and member of Parliament\'s Justice Committee, </p><p>he explained that, given well established Turkish practice: </p><p>1) the NSC (read: the military) will set the emergency rule </p><p>policy; 2) the military by itself will produce the actual </p><p>draft law, relying primarily on military lawyers working </p><p>directly for TGS; 3) the completed draft will then be passed </p><p>to the relevant Parliamentary committees, which will present </p><p>the draft as their own work. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) These comments are particularly striking coming from a </p><p>representative of the Party of Ataturk -- which is rabidly </p><p>opposed to USG intervention in Iraq.  On earlier occasions, </p><p>our contact told us of his concern lest he be branded a </p><p>"traitor" to Turkey for his support of a possible US-led war </p><p>against Saddam.  More important, his comments reflect what we </p><p>are hearing privately from numerous other Kurdish contacts </p><p>across the political spectrum (reftels and previous). </p><p>Despite their different party and other affiliations, our </p><p>Kurdish contacts are largely united in their conviction that </p><p>the Turkish State\'s policy in N. Iraq and toward its own </p><p>ethnically Kurdish citizens is deeply flawed and risks </p><p>promoting regional instability.  In this regard, they fear </p><p>that the palpably pro-war sentiment of many leading Kurds </p><p>will fuel Kemalist neuralgia in Ankara power centers (septel). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
