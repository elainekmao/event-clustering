<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 005569 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/15/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, KN, TU, CY, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN RESPONSE TO PRE- GAERC POINTS ON DPRK, </p><p>TURKEY, AND CYPRUS </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 229594 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05569  151740Z </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLMC T. COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.    (C) ON NOVEMBER 14, POLMINCOUNS DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS </p><p>TO ROCCO ANTONIO CANGELOSI, MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR EUROPEAN </p><p>INTEGRATION.  ON THE DPRK, CANGELOSI\'S WANTED TO KNOW, "WHAT </p><p>DO YOU EXPECT FROM THEM IN ORDER TO REOPEN THE DIALOGUE?" </p><p>POLMINCOUNS REPLIED THAT WE HAD LOST CONFIDENCE IN ANYTHING </p><p>THE DPRK HAD TO SAY; WHAT WE EXPECTED WAS AN END TO THE </p><p>NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.  CANGELOSI ASKED IF WE WERE SURE </p><p>THAT THE PROGRAM HAD RESUMED.  POLMINCOUNS ASSURED HIM THAT </p><p>THE EVIDENCE WAS CLEAR, AS WAS THEIR ADMISSION. </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) ON TURKEY, POLMINCOUNS STRESSED THAT NOT ONLY WAS </p><p>TAYYIP ERDOGAN SAYING "ALL THE RIGHT THINGS," BUT WE BELIEVED </p><p>THAT THE ELECTION RESULTS PRESENTED A VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY </p><p>FOR THE EU AND FOR TURKEY, SINCE THE TURKISH PARLIAMENT WAS </p><p>NOW BOTH PRO-EU AND PRO-REFORM.  CANGELOSI SAID THE GOI </p><p>SHARED THIS ANALYSIS AND FURTHERMORE BELIEVED THAT ERDOGAN </p><p>WOULD NOT JEOPARDIZE TURKISH SECULARISM.  IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>POLMINCOUNS\' REMARK THAT THE EU NEEDED TO SET A DATE FOR </p><p>TURKISH ACCESSION TALKS, AS PRIME MINISTER AND ACTING FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER SILVIO BERLUSCONI HAD REQUESTED, CANGELOSI SAID THAT </p><p>BERLUSCONI WAS HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING SUPPORT AMONG </p><p>HIS EU COUNTERPARTS FOR THIS SUGGESTION.  ACCESSION TALKS </p><p>WOULD MOST LIKELY BE A CLOSED MEETING, WHICH THE TURKS DID </p><p>NOT FAVOR.  IF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AGREED, HOWEVER, THE EU </p><p>COULD DO IT PUBLICLY. </p><p> </p><p>3.    (C) WITH REGARD TO CYPRUS, CANGELOSI REMARKED THAT THE </p><p>EU VIEWED TURKISH ACCESSION, THE EU-NATO RELATIONSHIP IN </p><p>ESDP, AND CYPRUS AS "ALL A PACKAGE."  THEY WOULD ALL NEED TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05569  151740Z </p><p>BE RESOLVED WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME OF EACH OTHER.  SINCE </p><p>ERDOGAN SEEMED TO BE OPEN TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL\'S </p><p>CYPRUS PROPOSAL, HE EXPECTED SOME PROGRESS IN PRAGUE. </p><p> </p><p>4.    (SBU) FINALLY, POLMINCOUNS ASKED WHETHER AN EU MISSION </p><p>IN MACEDONIA WOULD BE ON THE GAERC AGENDA.  CANGELOSI SAID </p><p>THAT ONLY A PROGRESS REPORT WAS EXPECTED, AS THE SITUATION </p><p>HAD NOT CHANGED. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME05569 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
