<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ISTANBUL 000349 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, KISL, TK, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: CLUES FROM ISTANBUL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 ISTANBUL 449 </p><p>     B. 02 ISTANBUL 390 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: In assessing the outlook for the new </p><p>government to be led by Justice and Development (AK) Party </p><p>leader Tayyip Erdogan, we look back at his only major </p><p>previous government experience --- as Istanbul Mayor from </p><p>1994 to 1998.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Refah and Grassroots Politics </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) Erdogan ran for Istanbul Mayor in 1994 with little </p><p>prior political experience.  However, he had benefited from </p><p>his work in the milieu of Islamist leader Erbakan\'s National </p><p>View (Milli Gorus) Movement, Erbakan\'s Refah Party (RP), and </p><p>his own natural political skills and personal charisma.  A </p><p>graduate of a preacher (Imam-Hatip) high school, Erdogan </p><p>worked his way up through the RP system and ran for Istanbul </p><p>Mayor from the platform of RP Chairman for Istanbul.  At that </p><p>time, Refah had pioneered pervasive grassroots political </p><p>organization, door-to-door campaigning, charitable donations, </p><p>and other techniques now widely emulated by other political </p><p>parties in Istanbul.  Such tactics proved to be particularly </p><p>successful in the populous Istanbul districts of </p><p>Gaziosmanpasa, Umraniye, Fatih, and Bagcilar districts --- </p><p>poor, migrant neighborhoods that were rapidly expanding as </p><p>Turkey underwent massive urbanization.  The newcomers came </p><p>from the poorest parts of Anatolia in search of jobs and </p><p>economic stability.  But Istanbul\'s inability to absorb them </p><p>combined with years of chronic high inflation left most </p><p>living in dire economic conditions, adding to the swelling </p><p>ranks of the urban poor.  Mostly conservative and religious, </p><p>they were welcomed by similarly conservative local RP </p><p>activists, mostly head-scarved women, who provided them with </p><p>donations of food and coal, as well as advice on how to find </p><p>homes and jobs.  Largely on the basis of their support, RP </p><p>had made steady in-roads in these and other neighborhoods of </p><p>Istanbul since 1984, winning an increasing share of the vote </p><p>and minor victories, including the Fatih District Mayorship </p><p>in 1989. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A Tight Race, A Narrow Mandate </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>3. (C) The support of the Refah party organization alone, </p><p>however, was not enough.  Erdogan benefited from the fact </p><p>that the Istanbul 1994 election was a tightly contested race </p><p>with strong candidates from several of the other parties. </p><p>The left and left-center votes were divided between </p><p>Democratic Left Party (DSP) candidate Necdet Ozkan (brother </p><p>of Husamettin Ozkan, who later became deputy PM under PM </p><p>Ecevit) and Socalist Democratic People\'s Party (SHP) </p><p>candidate Zulfu Livaneli.  The votes from the center-right </p><p>were split between Ilhan Kesici from the Motherland Party </p><p>(ANAP) and former Istanbul Mayor Bedrettin Dalan, who </p><p>abandoned ANAP and ran on the True Path Party (DYP) ticket. </p><p>Dalan told us recently that he had been promised the ANAP </p><p>nomination only to have it personally rescinded by ANAP </p><p>Chairman Mesut Yilmaz.  Dalan says that he then accepted the </p><p>DYP nomination with no expectation of victory (Note: DYP is </p><p>traditionally very weak in Istanbul. End Note), hoping merely </p><p>to split the center-right vote, deny victory to Kesici, and </p><p>thereby spite Yilmaz and ANAP.  The final results suggest </p><p>that he may have succeeded.  Erdogan edged out Kesici by a </p><p>little more than 40,000 votes with only 25.6 percent to </p><p>Kesici\'s 24.6 percent.  Livaneli finished third with 17.4 </p><p>percent and Dalan "the spoiler" finished with 12.5 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan the Man </p><p>--------------- </p><p>4. (U) Although impossible to quantify, Erdogan\'s charisma </p><p>and political savvy have also been key factors in his success </p><p>as a politician (see ref A for more detail).  Erdogan has </p><p>supporters throughout Istanbul and in all walks of life. </p><p>When asked why they like him, the most common response is </p><p>that he is someone they can trust.  Erdogan was a fresh face, </p><p>a talented football player, and came from humble beginnings </p><p>-- all political assets in a country that is chronically </p><p>disappointed with its politicians, as was the case with </p><p>Erdogan\'s predecessor, Nurettin Sozen.  Most Istanbul </p><p>residents also respected Erdogan\'s faith and devotion, </p><p>although his Islamist credentials were somewhat alarming and </p><p>controversial among the secularist establishment and public </p><p>media.  This controversy was fueled by pre-election promises </p><p>to build a mosque in Taksim square and close the city\'s </p><p>brothels, as well as by Mayor Erdogan\'s decisions to ban </p><p>alcohol in municipal facilities and to close the cafeterias </p><p>during Ramadan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Targeting the Urban Poor </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>5. (C) Once in office, however, Erdogan worked quickly to </p><p>bolster his public support and reward those who elected him </p><p>by devoting his efforts to addressing the needs of the urban </p><p>poor.  The standard mantra used by Erdogan supporters to </p><p>characterize his term is one in which corruption was replaced </p><p>by honest administration and city services were actually </p><p>delivered.  This view enjoys much popular resonance.  When </p><p>before the election we asked Erdogan supporters why they </p><p>backed him, we most often heard the refrain that "he got </p><p>things done in Istanbul."  Erdogan himself pointed to his </p><p>success in such areas as increasing water fee collections </p><p>25-fold to 25 million USD, thereby enabling the city to wean </p><p>itself from reliance on foreign donors to provide this </p><p>essential service.  More generally, Erdogan supporters </p><p>stressed the city\'s improving budget picture during his </p><p>tenure, in which a 2 billion USD deficit was transformed into </p><p>a surplus and civic investments expanded dramatically. </p><p>Scrutiny of Istanbul\'s budget books confirm some but not all </p><p>of these points.  In contrast to earlier periods, Istanbul </p><p>under Erdogan consistently ran a budget surplus.  Public </p><p>investments were not sacrificed to meet day-to-day </p><p>obligations, but were largely realized at the same rate as </p><p>the rest of the budget. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Many of our interlocutors point to the roads, gas, </p><p>and water networks built in the poor suburbs, crediting </p><p>Erdogan with improving the quality of life for millions of </p><p>Istanbul residents.  Erdogan gets less praise from middle and </p><p>upper-class Istanbul residents, many of whom live in the </p><p>richer neighborhoods of Besiktas, Bakirkoy, and Kadikoy, </p><p>which continued to experience the chronic urban challenges of </p><p>pollution and congestion.  Here, too, however, Erdogan is </p><p>often credited with completing the first line of Istanbul\'s </p><p>underground metro, cleaning up the Golden Horn, and </p><p>constructing an extensive natural gas network.  Former Mayor </p><p>Dalan claims that Erdogan had no "vision" and failed to </p><p>implement any major, new projects, merely executing those </p><p>that had been in the pipeline for years.  He says that </p><p>Erdogan called him to personally apologize for abandoning </p><p>Dalan\'s plan to revamp Taksim Square by rerouting traffic </p><p>through underground tunnels.  But even Dalan admits that </p><p>Erdogan was significantly better than his predecessor Sozen </p><p>and concedes that Erdogan "tried."  Rusen Cakir, a veteran </p><p>journalist with the Vatan daily newspaper and author of a </p><p>book on the Refah Party and a biography of Erdogan himself, </p><p>told poloff that from the beginning Erdogan saw Istanbul as a </p><p>platform for higher political ambitions.  As a result, </p><p>Erdogan worked hard to cultivate a broad constituency and </p><p>develop a reputation as an honest, effective administrator. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corruption </p><p>---------- </p><p>7. (C) If there is agreement that the depiction of Erdogan as </p><p>a mayor who got things done has a strong base in reality, </p><p>more questions surround the argument that he ran a clean (or </p><p>"ak") government.  Views differ as to Erdogan\'s personal </p><p>complicity in the various corruption scandals of his </p><p>administration, but there are few who would deny that "where </p><p>there is smoke, there is fire."  And while it is certainly </p><p>possible that the prosecution of the cases against Erdogan </p><p>may have been politically motivated, the public evidence and </p><p>what we have heard from Istanbul contacts in a position to </p><p>know point to an extensive pattern of corruption (see refs A </p><p>and B for further details).  The major scandals involved </p><p>corruption in the awarding of public tenders for the city </p><p>natural gas distribution system, the underground metro, </p><p>cleaning up the Golden Horn, trash collection, municipal </p><p>shuttle bus service, and planting trees in public spaces. </p><p>Erdogan was also charged with misappropriating funds by </p><p>manipulating data on the electronic tickets used for the </p><p>city\'s transportation services and for renting out municipal </p><p>advertisement billboards for below-market prices.  He has </p><p>been acquitted from all but one of these cases, although </p><p>there is still a possibility that other cases could still be </p><p>opened. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Former Istanbul CHP Chairman Mehmet Boluk, who was at </p><p>least partially responsible for collecting the evidence that </p><p>led to these cases, told us that major corruption in Istanbul </p><p>began under Dalan, continued under Sozen, but reached new </p><p>heights under Erdogan.  Rusen Cakir disagrees, arguing that </p><p>while corruption took place under Erdogan, it was much more </p><p>centralized and controlled (and therefore less in absolute </p><p>terms) than under Dalan and Sozen. In any case, the pattern </p><p>of corruption has been the same.  Mayors have used their </p><p>power to award and cancel public tenders to funnel money to </p><p>favored companies.  These companies, presumably, return the </p><p>favor by making payments into personal bank accounts or to </p><p>favored charities.  Another well-informed observer of Turkish </p><p>politics told us that in many cases political parties simply </p><p>send their campaign expenses to such companies, which then </p><p>pay them and conceal the payments as assorted business </p><p>expenses.  Rusen Cakir and others have told us that the </p><p>proceeds of corruption during Erdogan\'s administration were </p><p>primarily directed to charities and a select group of people, </p><p>and not widely disbursed through the city administration. </p><p>9. (C) How did Erdogan manage to keep his hands clean and </p><p>escape responsibility?  Boluk, who is also a former </p><p>investigative journalist (who also gathered and presented </p><p>evidence against Erdogan\'s CHP predecessor Sozen), believes </p><p>that the various cases have been dropped largely as a result </p><p>of political pressure from Erdogan and his supporters.  Boluk </p><p>cited the AKBIL (electronic ticket) case as an example. </p><p>After failing to appear for three consecutive court dates, </p><p>Erdogan finally came to court with a new legal team that </p><p>included two retired judges from the same court.  Without </p><p>explanation, the prosecutor himself asked that the charges be </p><p>dropped.  In other cases, unexplained delays in procedural </p><p>matters have led to charges being dropped due to a statute of </p><p>limitations clause. There are still outstanding charges </p><p>related to the IGDAS case, for example, but the prosecutor </p><p>has kept the file on his desk for months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Among the public, the cases have lacked traction </p><p>because of the widely-shared belief, stemming from Erdogan\'s </p><p>1997 conviction for "Islamist sedition", that Turkey\'s </p><p>secular establishment was hounding him and using the legal </p><p>system to pursue political ends.  In addition, unlike the </p><p>"mainstream" politicians who ran Istanbul, Erdogan still </p><p>benefits from a perception, almost uniquely applied to </p><p>Islamist politicians, that corruptly-attained funds were </p><p>plowed back either into city services-- via purchases of </p><p>ambulances, garbage trucks, and other amenities for </p><p>impoverished districts-- or in party/movement building rather </p><p>than venal pocket-lining.  (Note: As ref A notes, our </p><p>"establishment" contacts confirm that this perception had an </p><p>important basis in reality, and that ironically they would </p><p>have preferred the older system to being forced to contribute </p><p>to causes in which they did not believe.  End Note.)  AK\'s </p><p>move away from piously Islamic rhetoric to more mainstream </p><p>issues, coupled with its recruitment of shady though </p><p>presumably more traditional political figures, has made it </p><p>harder for Erdogan to maintain this political teflon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan\'s Cronies </p><p>----------------- </p><p>11. (C) Many of the other defendants and people who </p><p>presumably profited from these scandals have accompanied </p><p>Erdogan and the AK party to Ankara.  The president of a think </p><p>tank with close links to the Turkish government and state </p><p>told us that although other AK parliamentarians and party </p><p>people may be fiercely ideological, he believes that this </p><p>group is motivated primarily by its loyalty to Erdogan. </p><p>Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim, formerly the General </p><p>Director of the Istanbul Sea Bus, was removed from office on </p><p>corruption charges that took place under Erdogan.  Energy </p><p>Minister Mehmet Hilmi Guler was an adviser to Erdogan and an </p><p>IGDAS (Istanbul Natural Gas Distribution Company) board </p><p>member and a defendant in the natural gas corruption case. </p><p>Among those who are rumored to be added to a new Erdogan </p><p>cabinet next week are Idris Naim Sahin and Akif Gulle, both </p><p>of whom worked with Erdogan in Istanbul and were implicated </p><p>in various corruption scandals.  There are also more than a </p><p>dozen other AK parliamentarians that were implicated in the </p><p>various Erdogan corruption scandals.  Separately, the heads </p><p>of several major city-managed firms during Erdogan\'s tenure </p><p>and other Erdogan advisers have since been newly appointed to </p><p>lucrative positions as the heads of state-owned companies, </p><p>including Turkish Airlines, the State Water Works, Turkish </p><p>Petroleum Refineries Corporation, and the General Foundations </p><p>Directorate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>12. (C) Was Erdogan a successful mayor?  The answer depends </p><p>on whom you talk to and what constitutes success in their </p><p>minds.  One thing is clear, however.  Despite his narrow </p><p>mandate, the corruption scandals, and unrelenting criticism </p><p>regarding his Islamic leanings, Erdogan remained loyal to the </p><p>constituency that elected him.  He had little time for </p><p>grandiose new plans, instead devoting the bulk of his efforts </p><p>to providing municipal services to the urban poor.  In the </p><p>process he may well have enriched a circle of friends and </p><p>supporters, thereby laying important groundwork for the </p><p>eventual establishment of the AK Party and its success at the </p><p>polls in 2002.  Among the AK parliamentarians and other </p><p>power-brokers that have relocated to Ankara, it is likely </p><p>that there is a sizable group that is motivated more by </p><p>loyalty to Erdogan (and perhaps by simple greed) than by </p><p>ideological considerations.  As for Erdogan himself, if his </p><p>service as Istanbul Mayor is any guide, his efforts as Prime </p><p>Minister will be primarily devoted to solidifying and </p><p>expanding AK\'s voter base.  And although that base has </p><p>expanded considerably beyond the urban poor of Istanbul, it </p><p>still remains largely disenfranchised and conservative. </p><p>Satisfying this segment of the Turkish population while </p><p>operating under the rigid austerity of Turkey\'s IMF program </p><p>will be among Erdogan\'s greatest challenges.  End Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
