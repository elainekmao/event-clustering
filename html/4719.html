(C) Post concurs that the 12/18 UNSC session to receive </p><p>the report from Coordinator for Kuwaiti Property Yuli </p><p>Vorontsov provides a good opportunity for the USG to denounce </p><p>Saddam\'s December 7 speech addressed to the Kuwaitis, which </p><p>was billed as an apology but was in fact filled with insults, </p><p>threats and incitement to violence.  We agree with the </p><p>sentiment expressed by the Kuwaiti Mission in New York </p><p>(reftel) that this is worthwhile whether or not a </p><p>condemnation of the speech makes it into the final press </p><p>statement. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
