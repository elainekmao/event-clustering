END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>============= </p><p>TALKS WRAP UP </p><p>============= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The fourth round of talks between the </p><p>Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) wrapped up on January 9.  (Note:  The </p><p>Norwegian government-facilitated talks began on </p><p>January 6 and took place at a resort hotel in the </p><p>Bangkok area.  For information on previous rounds see </p><p>Ref C.)  Based on the Norwegian facilitators\' press </p><p>statement issued at the close of the talks, which is </p><p>contained in Ref B, key understandings reached by the </p><p>two sides included the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Resettlement:  The two sides agreed to move forward </p><p>on resettling Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) </p><p>outside the area of the Sri Lankan military\'s high </p><p>security zones in Jaffna.  To do this, the two sides </p><p>agreed on an "Action Plan for an Accelerated </p><p>Resettlement Program for the Jaffna District."  This </p><p>plan has various elements, including a phase providing </p><p>for assessment of the issue, which would be completed in </p><p>the near-term. </p><p> </p><p>-- Security Zones:  The two sides agreed, in essence, to </p><p>continue to discuss this sensitive and complex issue. </p><p>(Note:  The GSL military\'s high security zones cover </p><p>approximately 18 percent of Jaffna District.  The Tigers </p><p>want the zones drastically reduced, but the government </p><p>and the military disagree.)  The second phase of the </p><p>"Action Plan" mentioned above would focus on the issue </p><p>of the resettlement of IDPs and refugees in the high </p><p>security zones "as and when they are released by the </p><p>security forces."  To accomplish this, the GSL agreed to </p><p>develop a plan on the issue using an "internationally </p><p>recognized military expert, taking into account relevant </p><p>humanitarian and security needs."  (Note:  From what </p><p>Mission understands, the expert is a retired Indian </p><p>general named Sathish Nambiar.) </p><p> </p><p>-- De-escalation Sub-Committee:  The Norwegian press </p><p>statement notes that the two sides "did not reach </p><p>agreement on the continuation of the work of the (joint </p><p>GSL-LTTE) Sub-Committee on De-escalation and </p><p>Normalization."  (Note:  The Tigers have pulled out of </p><p>the sub-committee, charging that the body has not made </p><p>enough progress in resolving the security zone issue.) </p><p> </p><p>-- World Bank role:  Both sides agreed that the World </p><p>Bank would serve as custodian of funds allotted for the </p><p>"North East Reconstruction Fund" (NERF).  In performing </p><p>this role, the World Bank would report to the joint GSL- </p><p>LTTE Sub-Committee on Immediate Humanitarian and </p><p>Rehabilitation Needs. </p><p> </p><p>-- Human Rights:  The parties agreed to continue </p><p>discussing human rights issues.  They agreed that a </p><p>"human rights adviser" will be appointed to work on the </p><p>issue.  (Note:  According to press reports, Ian Martin, </p><p>a former official with Amnesty International, will </p><p>fulfill this role.)  The two sides will also work with </p><p>the ICRC to create an "independent verification </p><p>mechanism" to deal with MIAs and disappearances. </p><p> </p><p>-- Next Rounds:  Future rounds of talks are scheduled </p><p>for: </p><p> </p><p>- February 7-10 </p><p>- March 18-21 </p><p>- April 29 - May 2 </p><p>- June (dates to be determined per the scheduling of the </p><p>international donor conference in Japan) </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  According to press reports, various side </p><p>meetings also took place on the margins of the talks on </p><p>the issue of federalism.  A number of Sri Lankan NGO </p><p>representatives and academics, in addition to foreign </p><p>experts, reportedly interacted with the GSL and LTTE </p><p>delegations in meetings on this issue.) </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  A press conference involving the parties was </p><p>reportedly scheduled to take place late January 9, after </p><p>this message was sent out.) </p><p> </p><p>========================= </p><p>REACTION LARGELY POSITIVE </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Back in Sri Lanka, reaction to the talks has </p><p>been largely positive.  In discussions with contacts, </p><p>Mission picked up the following comments: </p><p> </p><p>-- Jehan Perera, the head of the National Peace Council, </p><p>a highly regarded local NGO, remarked that he thought </p><p>the talks had gone extremely well.  Both sides had </p><p>agreed to keep the process moving and not to let any </p><p>disagreements block progress on other issues.  It was </p><p>almost as if the GSL and the LTTE were working together </p><p>to make the process work, so that anti-peace process </p><p>elements in the south could not take advantage of any </p><p>divisions between the two sides. </p><p> </p><p>-- Joseph Pararajasingham, a MP for the Tamil National </p><p>Alliance who has close links with the LTTE, told us the </p><p>talks had made important progress.  The fact that the </p><p>two sides had agreed to proceed with resettlement was </p><p>very important to the Tamil people.  Tamils also hoped </p><p>that the agreement about using the World Bank would help </p><p>speed up aid disbursements to the north and east.  While </p><p>making these points, Pararajasingham underlined that the </p><p>issue of the security zones was still problematic and </p><p>would have to be dealt with sooner rather than later. </p><p> </p><p>-- Kethesh Loganathon of the Center for Policy </p><p>Alternatives, another local NGO working on peace-related </p><p>issues, remarked that this round of talks had been </p><p>successful in coming to agreement on practical matters, </p><p>such as resettlement.  Unlike past rounds, there had </p><p>been no breakthroughs, however, and there was no sense </p><p>of "euphoria" over the results.  Nonetheless, the two </p><p>sides were still talking in a serious way, which was </p><p>very positive for the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>============================= </p><p>RADICAL PARTY HOLDS BIG RALLY </p><p>============================= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) On a down note for the peace process, a </p><p>radical Sinhalese chauvinist party held a large rally in </p><p>Colombo late January 8.  The rally, which was sponsored </p><p>by the Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the third </p><p>largest party in Parliament, was well-attended, with a </p><p>crowd of several thousand present.  JVP leaders used the </p><p>event to give speeches lambasting the peace process as a </p><p>"sell-out" to the LTTE.  Speakers, including party </p><p>General Secretary Tilvin Silva and spokesman Wimal </p><p>Weerawansa, also lashed out at the Norwegian government </p><p>in bitter fashion, charging it with siding with the </p><p>LTTE.  In doing this, they again raised the issue of the </p><p>recent import of radio equipment for the LTTE in a </p><p>Norwegian Embassy diplomatic consignment.  (Note:  The </p><p>embassy only did this at the express request of the </p><p>government.  The GoN\'s involvement has come under sharp </p><p>criticism from opposition parties and in the anti-peace </p><p>process press in recent weeks -- see Ref C.)  Silva went </p><p>on to call for the toppling of the government because it </p><p>was "betraying the nation" via its peace initiative and </p><p>"heaping a burden on the people" through its economic </p><p>policies. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Overall, the talks seem to have been another </p><p>success for the peace process.  Both sides clearly </p><p>wanted the talks to maintain the momentum of the process </p><p>as a whole and they largely succeeded in doing just </p><p>that.  That said, the fact that the two sides basically </p><p>punted on the issue of the security zones in Jaffna </p><p>illustrates just how sensitive an issue it is and how </p><p>hard it will be to reach an accommodation.  Given all </p><p>the tension over the issue (symbolized by the LTTE\'s </p><p>pulling out of the de-escalation sub-committee), it was </p><p>probably sensible for the two sides to put the security </p><p>zones on the backburner and move on to other pressing </p><p>matters.  In the longer term, the issue is probably not </p><p>intractable, but the two sides clearly need more time to </p><p>deal with it. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) As for the JVP, there is little doubt that the </p><p>group is trying to mobilize anti-peace process forces. </p><p>At this point, however, the JVP does not appear to be </p><p>picking up much traction and the results of the fourth </p><p>round will probably buoy public support for the process </p><p>even more.  Nonetheless, the JVP is clearly positioning </p><p>itself should there be serious bumps in the road for the </p><p>GSL\'s peace initiative.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>======================== </p><p>SUGGESTED PRESS GUIDANCE </p><p>======================== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Suggested "if asked" press guidance follows: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. has taken note of the talks between the </p><p>Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) held in Thailand from January 6-9.  We </p><p>regard as extremely positive the announcement that the </p><p>two sides have made progress in plans for resettling </p><p>Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).  It is also </p><p>positive that the two sides have agreed to meet again in </p><p>February, April/May, and June.  We salute the Norwegian </p><p>government\'s able facilitation of the talks and the Thai </p><p>government for hosting them. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
