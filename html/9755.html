<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004713 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN STOCK OF ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) STATE 214593; B) USUN NY 1718 </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified; please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Jordan has been extremely forthcoming with </p><p>humanitarian and other assistance for Iraq in the months </p><p>following the end of major combat operations.  As requested </p><p>ref (a), below is an illustrative (but we believe not an </p><p>exhaustive) list of material assistance provided to Iraq by </p><p>the GOJ.  In addition to this list, the GOJ and Jordanian </p><p>private sector have been actively supporting a whole host </p><p>of rebuilding activities, from hosting CPA sectoral </p><p>meetings and conferences to consulting with CPA and CIC </p><p>officials on reconstruction and assistance issues to </p><p>facilitating transportation of third-country assistance </p><p>through the port of Aqaba and the Trebil border crossing to </p><p>assisting with refugee flows. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Jordan wants to be a key partner in the rebuilding </p><p>effort for the foreseeable future, and we expect the GOJ to </p><p>back that desire with continued provision of material and </p><p>technical assistance.  (Note:  Due to the abbreviated </p><p>timeline for ref a tasker, most donations do not have a </p><p>dollar value attached.  In many cases, attaching such a </p><p>value would be guesswork at best.  End note.)  Information </p><p>on Iraqi assets will be provided septel. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Begin list of Contributions: </p><p> </p><p>Al Fallujah, Iraq:  For humanitarian purposes only, the </p><p>Jordanian Armed Forces Medical Personnel set up and ran a </p><p>field hospital in Al Fallujah, during the war and post </p><p>conflict.  This hospital has treated over 50,000 patients </p><p>to date (approximate cost to run hospital per </p><p>month...$210,000 pharmaceuticals;  $93,800 consumable </p><p>medicals). </p><p> </p><p>Baghdad, Iraq:  For humanitarian purposes only, the </p><p>Jordanian Ministry of Health donated over 11 semi-trailer </p><p>truck loads of medical supplies, which Jordanian Armed </p><p>Forces Personnel and Personnel from HACC-West escorted to </p><p>Baghdad, Iraq during the war.  These medical supplies were </p><p>delivered to the Iraqi Ministry of Health in Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>Al Rutbah, Iraq:  For humanitarian purposes only, the </p><p>Jordanian Armed Forces Medical Personnel along with the </p><p>Jordanian Ministry of Health, per our request, performed a </p><p>vaccination program for over 4,000 children in Ar Rutbah, </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Al Najaf, Iraq:  Jordanian Armed Forces Medical Personnel </p><p>accompanied an Indian Medical team and HACC-West personnel </p><p>to coordinate with CPA and then recon hospitals in An Najaf </p><p>to participate in CENTCOM\'s "Adopt a Hospital."

The total </p><p>contribution for this program from India and Jordan will be </p><p>between $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 dollars in personnel, </p><p>supplies, and equipment.  This project will begin after the </p><p>first week of August.  The split of personnel and costs </p><p>between India and Jordan should be approximately 85/15. </p><p> </p><p>Iraq/Jordan Border:  The Jordanian Ministry of Interior and </p><p>Customs Directorate have increased the size of their staff </p><p>to operate the border 24 hours a day and has waived all </p><p>customs fees for humanitarian goods destined for Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Jordanian Crisis Management Center (CMC):  was stood up at </p><p>General Head Quarters (GHQ) to assist and coordinate the </p><p>flow of humanitarian aid into Iraq.
