S - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM IS POSING AN </p><p>INCREASING CHALLENGE TO SECULAR NATIONALIST </p><p>PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATIONS ON THE WEST BANK. </p><p>RECENT WEEKS HAVE SEEN DIRECT CHALLENGES BY THE </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD-CREATED GROUP "HAMAS" TO THE </p><p>PLO/UNIFIED NATIONAL LEADERSHIP OF THE UPRISING </p><p>(UNLU) WHICH CURRENTLY LEADS THE UPRISING.  THIS </p><p>CHALLENGE, WHICH HAS MET WITH MIXED SUCCESS, HAS </p><p>TAKEN THE FORM OF LEAFLETS CRITICAL OF UNLU AND </p><p>THE PLO, ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE ALTERNATIVE STRIKE </p><p>DAYS, AND EVEN CLASHES IN CERTAIN LOCALITIES. </p><p>THUS FAR, HAMAS HAS DEMONSTRATED STRENGTH IN </p><p>THOSE AREAS WHERE EXISTING ISLAMIC INSTITUTIONS </p><p>HAVE WIDESPREAD POPULAR SUPPORT:  NABLUS AND THE </p><p>NORTHERN WEST BANK, WHERE IT SEEMS TO BE BEST </p><p>ORGANIZED; THE RAMALLAH-EL BIREH AREA; AND </p><p>HEBRON.  ITS ATTEMPTS TO MAKE INROADS INTO THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN ENCLAVE OF BETHLEHEM-BEIT JALA-BEIT </p><p>SAHOUR HAVE BEEN RESISTED BY LOCAL RESIDENTS. </p><p>HAMAS REMAINS WEAK IN COSMOPOLITAN EAST </p><p>JERUSALEM.  WHATEVER THE CURRENT ACTUAL STRENGTH </p><p>OF HAMAS--AND ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY--IT HAS </p><p>SUCCEEDED IN BECOMING A FACTOR TO BE RECKONED </p><p>WITH IN CONSIDERING THE FUTURE OF THE INTIFADA </p><p>ON THE WEST BANK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  HAMAS IS NOT THE ONLY MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>GROUP FUNCTIONING ON THE WEST BANK.  THE FATAH- </p><p>AFFILIATED "ISLAMIC JIHAD"--NOT TO BE CONFUSED </p><p>WITH THE SHIITE GROUP OF THE SAME NAME FOUND IN </p><p>LEBANON AND ELSEWHERE--WAS CRIPPLED BY THE </p><p>KILLING OF THREE SENIOR LEADERS IN CYPRUS.  IT </p><p>HAS NOT RECOVERED TO ESTABLISH ITSELF AS AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT PLAYER IN THE STRUGGLE FOR THE </p><p>HEARTS AND MINDS OF WEST BANK PALESTINIANS. </p><p>OTHER SMALL, SHADOWY GROUPS ALSO RISE AND FALL, </p><p>CREATING LITTLE MORE THAN A RIPPLE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THIS REPORT IS ONLY A PRELIMINARY ATTEMPT TO </p><p>IDENTIFY QUESTIONS FOR FUTURE STUDY.  ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO </p><p>PENETRATE; UNDERSTANDING THEIR INTERNAL </p><p>STRUCTURES AND EXTERNAL GOALS WILL TAKE MUCH </p><p>TIME AND PATIENCE.  THIS IS A FIRST PASS AT THE </p><p>SUBJECT ON THE WEST BANK, BASED TO A LARGE </p><p>EXTENT ON CONTACTS FROM JERUSALEM AND THE </p><p>NORTHERN WEST BANK CITY OF NABLUS.  WE HAVE LESS </p><p>COMPLETE INFORMATION ON THE SITUATION IN THE </p><p>SOUTHERN WEST BANK.  GAZA HAS ITS OWN PATTERN OF </p><p>ISLAMIC POLITICS.  WE WOULD WELCOME INFORMATION </p><p>FROM CAIRO AND AMMAN ON EGYPTIAN AND JORDANIAN </p><p>ISLAMIC POLITICAL TIES WITH THE OCCUPIED </p><p>TERRITORIES.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS--BACKGROUND AND HISTORICAL OVERVIEW </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  HAMAS IS A CREATION OF THE MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD (MB), WITH TIES TO THE MB THROUGHOUT </p><p>THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  THE NAME "HAMAS" WAS </p><p>APPARENTLY CHOSEN IN FEBRUARY 1988, BUT NOT USED </p><p>EXTENSIVELY UNTIL MAY.  AN ACRONYM FOR "ISLAMIC </p><p>RESISTANCE MOVEMENT," THE WORD ITSELF IS ARABIC </p><p>FOR "ZEALOTS." </p><p> </p><p>6.  ALTHOUGH PALESTINIANS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF </p><p>THE WEST BANK HAVE STRONG ISLAMIC CONVICTIONS, </p><p>THEY TEND TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES POLITICALLY IN </p><p>SECULAR TERMS.  ISLAM HAS, HOWEVER, PLAYED A </p><p>ROLE IN WEST BANK POLITICS SINCE THE LATE 1940S, </p><p>WHEN THE MB FIRST CAME TO THE WEST BANK.  THE MB </p><p>WAS SHORTLY AFTER DISCREDITED IN THE EYES OF </p><p>PALESTINIANS BY ITS SUPPORT FOR KING HUSSEIN IN </p><p>HIS POWER STRUGGLE AGAINST PM NABULSI IN THE </p><p>MID-50S.  DURING JORDANIAN RULE, IT WAS TIGHTLY </p><p>MONITORED BY JORDANIAN INTELLIGENCE AND DID NOT </p><p>GAIN SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE UNTIL THE MID- TO </p><p>LATE-70S, PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTHERN WEST BANK. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN 1976, M0 SUPPORTERS ATTACKED AND BURNED A </p><p>NABLUS THEATER SHOWING AN "IMMODEST" PLAY.  THIS </p><p>IS OFTEN CONSIDERED THE BEGINNING OF THE MB\'S </p><p>EMERGENCE AS A VIABLE POLITICAL FORCE IN THE </p><p>NORTHERN WEST BANK.  ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS </p><p>BUILT A POWER BASE IN AN-NAJAH UNIVERSITY, WHERE </p><p>THEY GAINED CONTROL OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL IN </p><p>1978.  THIS SURGE IN POPULARITY WAS PROBABLY DUE </p><p>TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS:  1) THE RISE OF </p><p>KHOMEINISM IN IRAN, WHICH GAVE FUNDAMENTALISM A </p><p>BOOST THROUGHOUT THE MUSLIM WORLD; 2) THE </p><p>DISCREDITING OF TRADITIONAL ARAB LEADERS IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF SADAT\'S TRIP TO JERUSALEM; 3) A LARGE </p><p>INFLOW OF MONEY FROM THE MB IN JORDAN AND EGYPT; </p><p>AND 4) THE DENIAL BY FUNDAMENTALISTS THAT THEY </p><p>BELONGED TO THE FORMERLY DISCREDITED MB-- </p><p>INSTEAD, THEY CALLED THEMSELVES THE "INDEPENDENT </p><p>ISLAMIC BLOC." </p><p> </p><p>8.  SUPPORT FOR THE FUNDAMENTALISTS AT AN-NAJAH, </p><p>AS ELSEWHERE IN THE WEST BANK, HAS EBBED AND </p><p>FLOWED ACCORDING TO THE PLO\'S FORTUNES AND THE </p><p>STATUS OF FUNDAMENTALISM IN THE MUSLIM WORLD. </p><p>SECULAR LEADERS IN THE NORTHERN WEST BANK, AIDED </p><p>BY PLO MONEY, WORKED TO CONTAIN THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS AND REDUCE THEIR INFLUENCE IN </p><p>AN-NAJAH UNIVERSITY.  THE FUNDAMENTALISTS LOST </p><p>CREDIBILITY, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE PLO BORE THE </p><p>BRUNT OF THE FIGHTING DU8ING THE 1982 INVASION </p><p>OF LEBANON AND DURING THE PERIOD OF ARAFAT- </p><p>HUSSEIN RECONCILIATION.  THEY HAVE GAINED </p><p>STRENGTH WHEN THE PLO APPEARED WEAK AND DIVIDED. </p><p> </p><p>9.  BY THE END OF 1987, FUNDAMENTALISTS AND </p><p>NATIONALISTS IN THE NORTHERN WEST BANK HAD </p><p>ACHIEVED AN UNEASY STATUS QUO MARKED BY </p><p>OCCASIONAL VIOLENT CLASHES.  IN NABLUS THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS TENDED TO BE RESENTED BY THE </p><p>SECULAR COMMUNITY, BUT ALSOFEARED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WHEN THE INTIFADA BEGAN, THE MB ACTED </p><p>DECISIVELY TO SEIZE A ROLE.  SEVERAL FACTORS </p><p>CONTRIBUTED TO THE MB DECISION TO INVOLVE ITSELF </p><p>FOR SEVERAL REASONS.  ISLAMIC JIHAD HAD WON </p><p>CONSIDERABLE PRESTIGE FOR ITS ROLE IN GAZA, AND </p><p>THE MB FEARED LOSING SUPPORT AND CREDIBILITY IN </p><p>THE FUNDAMENTALIST COMMUNITY.  INDIVIDUAL MB </p><p>MEMBERS WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INTIFADA; </p><p>THE MB LEADERSHIP FEARED THAT IF MEMBERS COULD </p><p>NOT USE THE MB AS A VEHICLE FOR PARTICIPATION, </p><p>THEY WOULD TURN TO OTHER FUNDAMENTALIST OR </p><p>NATIONALIST ORGANIZATIONS.  MB LEADERS BELIEVED, </p><p>THEN AS NOW, THAT THE INTIFADA WILL BE CARRIED </p><p>TO A CONCLUSION.  THEY WANTED A SAY IN THAT </p><p>FINAL SETTLEMENT.  FINALLY, THE MB HAD A </p><p>READY-MADE ORGANIZATION PRESENT IN THE WEST </p><p>BANK.  ACCORDINGLY, THE MB CREATED HAMAS IN </p><p>FEBRUARY 1988 AND BEGAN ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE </p><p>UPRISING. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS--STRUCTURE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE MB HAS ITS HEADQUARTERS IN CAIRO, WITH </p><p>A BRANCH IN AMMAN.  SUB-BRANCHES ARE PRESENT IN </p><p>THE WEST BANK (NABLUS) AND GAZA.  THE HEAD OF </p><p>THE MB IN THE WEST BANK REPORTEDLY IS NABIL </p><p>BUSHTAWI, OF NABLUS.  OTHER KEY WEST-BANK </p><p>FIGURES FROM NABLUS ARE SHEIKH SAID BILAL AND </p><p>HAMID BITAWI. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE RELATION BETWEEN CAIRO, AMMAN, THE WEST </p><p>BANK, AND GAZA REMAINS UNCLEAR, AS IS THE </p><p>RELATION BETWEEN THE NABLUS LEADERSHIP AND OTHER </p><p>AREAS OF THE WEST BANK.  THERE ARE STRONG LINKS </p><p>WITH CAIRO AND AMMAN, AND SOME MB LEADERS MAY </p><p>HOLD POSITIONS IN JORDANIAN INTELLIGENCE. </p><p>APPARENTLY, KY DECISIONS ARE MADE IN CAIRO AND </p><p>AMMAN, BUT LOCAL UNITS RETAIN CONSIDERABLE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE OF ACTION.  MONEY FLOWS IN FROM </p><p>CAIRO AND AMMAN, AS WELL AS BEING RAISED LOCALLY </p><p>THROUGH THE MOSQUES. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE MB IN NABLUS REPORTEDLY CONSISTS OF </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 150 MEMBERS HEADED BY A 4 OR 5 MAN </p><p>COMMITTEE.  THE LEADERSHIP CONSISTS OF MUSLIM </p><p>SHEIKHS, UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS AT AN-NAJAH AND </p><p>BIR ZEIT UNIVERSITIES, INSTRUCTORS AT THE </p><p>KULLIYET AL-DAWA (AN ISLAMIC COLLEGE AFFILIATED </p><p>WITH JERUSALEM UNIVERSITY, LOCATED IN BEIT </p><p>HANINA, NORTH JERUSALEM), EMPLOYEES OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC WAQF, A SHARIA JUDGE, AND VARIOUS </p><p>MERCHANTS.  THE "FOOT SOLDIERS" OF HAMAS/MB IN </p><p>NABLUS CONSIST OF DISADVANTAGED YOUTHS FROM THE </p><p>POORER SECTIONS OF THE OLD TOWN (CASBAH).  THIS </p><p>NETWORK SEEMS TO BE STABLE--FEW ARRESTS, FEW </p><p>DEFECTIONS, FEW NEW CONVERTS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE LEADERSHIP MAKES USE OF THE MOSQUES TO </p><p>PLAN, PROSELYTIZE, INSTRUCT, AND RAISE MONEY. </p><p>THIS IS A MAJOR ADVANTAGE HAMAS POSSESSES OVER </p><p>THE UNLU, SINCE MANY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS </p><p>UNIVERSITIES, CHARITIES, AND PROFESSIONAL </p><p>SOCIETIES THROUGH WHICH THE UNLU COULD OPERATE </p><p>HAVE BEEN CLOSED BY ISRAELI AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS--METHOD OF OPERATION </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT BY TIGHTLY KNIT </p><p>CELLS OF AS FEW AS FIVE MEMBERS.  OUTSIDERS </p><p>RARELY PARTICIPATE IN HAMAS ACTIONS, A </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE FROM INTIFADA ACTIVITIES </p><p>IN GENERAL, WHICH DERIVE CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH </p><p>FROM THE SPONTANEOUS PARTICIPATION OF LARGE </p><p>NUMBERS OF PALESTINIANS.  HAMAS ALSO SEEKS </p><p>MAXIMUM PUBLICITY FOR ITS ACTS.  BEFORE A </p><p>STRIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, RED SPRAY-PAINTED </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS--BOLDLY SIGNED "HAMAS"--ARE IN </p><p>EVIDENCE THROUGHOUT AREAS OF HAMAS INFLUENCE. </p><p>AS A RESULT OF ITS PENCHANT FOR TIGHT CONTROL </p><p>AND PUBLICITY, HAMAS TENDS NOT TO COOPERATE IN </p><p>UNLU-ORGANIZED ACTIONS.  IN NABLUS, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>HAMAS HAS REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPROMPTU </p><p>BLOOD DRIVES ORGANIZED ON SHORT NOTICE BY </p><p>POPULAR COMMITTEES TO TREAT WOUNDED PALESTINIANS. </p><p> </p><p>16.  HAMAS USES DIFFERENT METHODS TO ENFORCE ITS </p><p>STRIKE CALLS, DEPENDING ON ITS STRENGTH IN THE </p><p>TOWN INVOLVED.  IN RAMALLAH AND THE BEIT HANINA </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD OF NORTH JERUSALEM, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>HAMAS FOLLOWERS REPORTEDLY WERE ON THE SCENE TO </p><p>ENFORCE THE SEPTEMBER 9 STRIKE.  ALTHOUGH NO </p><p>CLASHES WERE REPORTED IN THESE AREAS, THERE HAVE </p><p>BEEN CONFRONTATIONS WITH UNLU SUPPORTERS ON </p><p>PRIOR OCCASIONS.  NO CLASHES WERE REPORTED IN </p><p>NABLUS, APPARENTLY BECAUSE THE UNLU CHOSE NOT TO </p><p>TEST HAMAS\' STRENGTH.  IN THE PAST, HOWEVER, </p><p>HAMAS HAS FIREBOMBED CHRISTIAN SHOPS THAT SOLD </p><p>LIQUOR OR OTHERWISE DEFIED ITS ORDERS.  IN </p><p>BETHLEHEM, TIRES WERE BURNED AND THERE WERE </p><p>CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN HAMAS AND UNLU SUPPORTERS </p><p>ON THE OCCASION OF THE SEPTEMBER 9 STRIKE.  SOME </p><p>SHOPS WERE INTIMIDATED INTO CLOSING EARLY. </p><p>HOWEVER, MOST STAYED OPEN.  IN JERUSALEM, HAMAS </p><p>WAS NOT IN EVIDENCE, AND THE STIKE CALL WAS </p><p>LARGELY IGNORED. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS--RELATIVE REGIONAL STRENGTH </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>17.  HAMAS APPEARS TO BE STRONGEST IN GAZA.  IN </p><p>THE WEST BANK, IT SEEMS TO BE BASED IN THE </p><p>TOWNS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHERE THE INHABITANTS </p><p>ARE RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS AND HAVE A RELIGIOUS </p><p>BENT. ITS PRIMARY WEST BANK STRONGHOLDS, IN </p><p>DESCENDING ORDER OF INFLUENCE, APPEAR TO BE </p><p>NABLUS, RAMALLAH, AND HEBRON.  HAMAS IS PRESENT </p><p>IN JERUSALEM, PARTICULARLY THE BEIT HANINA </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTH JERUSALEM NEAR RAMALLAH. </p><p>IN DOWNTOWN EAST JERUSALEM AND THE OLD CITY, </p><p>HAMAS IS PRESENT BUT WEAK, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE COSMOPOLITAN CHARACTER OF THESE AREAS. </p><p>HAMAS IS TRYING TO INCREASE ITS FOOTHOLD IN THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN AREA OF BETHLEHEM-BEIT JALA-BEIT </p><p>SAHOUR, THOUGH THUS FAR ITS INTIMIDATION TACTICS </p><p>HAVE NOT PROVED SUCCESSFUL.  (IN FACT, HAMAS </p><p>ACTIONS IN THESE CHRISTIAN AREAS HAVE LED TO THE </p><p>REAPPEARANCE OF HAMAM, THE "CHRISTIAN" </p><p>RESISTANCE MOVEMENT, WHOSE ACRONYM FORMS THE </p><p>ARABIC WORD FOR "DOVE.")  WE DO NOT YET HAVE A </p><p>GOOD FEEL FOR HAMAS IN HEBRON, THOUGH WE KNOW IT </p><p>HAS BEEN ACTIVE.  THE AUGUST 21 AND SEPTEMBER 9 </p><p>STRIKE CALLS WERE OBSERVED THERE.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>ITS INHABITANTS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE STRONG </p><p>RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HERE </p><p>AS ELSEWHERE MUCH OF HAMAS\' STRENGTH DERIVES </p><p>FROM THE POPULATION\'S TRADITIONAL SUPPORT FOR </p><p>ISLAMIC INSTITUTIONS, RATHER THAN FROM A </p><p>CONSCIOUS DECISION TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HAMAS AND </p><p>THE PLO. </p><p> </p><p>18.  HAMAS IS THOUGHT TO BE WEAK IN THE </p><p>COUNTRYSIDE, WHERE THE MB HAS TRADITIONALLY </p><p>LACKED INFLUENCE AND ORGANIZATION, AND IN THE </p><p>REFUGEE CAMPS, WHERE SECULAR NATIONALIST </p><p>MOVEMENTS (FATAH, PFLP, COMMUNISTS, ETC.) REMAIN </p><p>FIRMLY ENTRENCHED.  AN INTERESTING EXCEPTION IS </p><p>NEW ASKAR CAMP WHERE, BECAUSE OF THE ARREST OF </p><p>ALMOST THE ENTIRE FATAH LEADERSHIP, HAMAS HAS </p><p>BEEN ABLE TO MOVE IN AND ORGANIZE. </p><p> </p><p>19.  IT IS DIFFICULT ACCURATELY TO GAUGE HAMAS\' </p><p>STRENGTH FROM THE SUCCESS OF ITS STRIKE CALLS. </p><p>HAMAS HAS CHOSEN ITS DAYS WISELY--AUGUST 21 WAS </p><p>THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE ATTEMPT TO BURN THE </p><p>AL-AQSA MOSQUE, A TRADITIONAL DAY OF PROTEST, </p><p>AND SEPTEMBER 9 WAS BOTH A FRIDAY, WHEN MANY </p><p>SHOPS ARE CLOSED ANYWAY, AND THE BEGINNING OF A </p><p>NEW MONTH OF THE INTIFADA, AGAIN A TRADITIONAL </p><p>DAY OF PROTEST.  THUS, HAMAS WAS CALLING FOR </p><p>STRIKES ON DAYS THAT PEOPLE CUSTOMARILY MARK </p><p>WITH STRIKES AND PROTESTS AND DID NOT ACT </p><p>AGAINST THE FLOW OF THE INTIFADA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS--RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>20.  MANY WEST BANKERS BELIEVE THAT ISRAEL </p><p>ACTIVELY SUPPORTS HAMAS IN AN EFFORT TO DIVIDE </p><p>PALESTINIANS AND WEAKEN THE INTIFADA.  THEY </p><p>POINT TO THE FACT THAT HAMAS OPERATIVES ACT </p><p>BOLDLY IN DISTRIBUTING THEIR LEAFLETS. </p><p>SHOPKEEPERS IN JERUSALEM AND NABLUS REPORT THAT, </p><p>WHEREAS UNLU LEAFLETS ARE DISTRIBUTED SECRETLY </p><p>FOR FEAR OF ISRAELI SECURITY FORCES, HAMAS </p><p>OPERATIVES WALK INTO SHOPS AND PRESENT THEIR </p><p>LEAFLETS DIRECTLY TO THE OWNERS.  MAYOR FREIJ OF </p><p>BETHLEHEM CLAIMS THAT MEMBERS OF SOME WELL KNOWN </p><p>FAMILIES WHO COLLABORATE WITH ISRAELI OFFICIALS </p><p>HAVE BEEN SEEN AMONG HAMAS STREET GANGS IN </p><p>BETHLEHEM.  FURTHERMORE, DESPITE MASSIVE </p><p>ARRESTS--AND THE PUBLIC IDENTITY OF MANY MB </p><p>LEADERS--RELATIVELY FEW HAMAS LEADERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>DETAINED.  IN RECENT WEEKS, FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>LEADERS HAVE GIVEN INTERVIEWS TO ISRAELI </p><p>PUBLICATIONS THAT WOULD HAVE LANDED SECULARIST </p><p>LEADERS IN DETENTION.  WE BELIEVE THAT, WHILE </p><p>ISRAELI FORCES MAY BE TURNING A BLIND EYE TO </p><p>HAMAS ACTIVITIES, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE </p><p>TO CONCLUDE THAT ISRAEL IS PROVIDING ACTIVE </p><p>SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS--RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INTIFADA LEADERSHIP </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>21.  HAMAS\' FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES, AS SET OUT </p><p>IN ITS AUGUST 18 CHARTER (REF B), PUT IT IN </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE SECULAR LEADERSHIP OF THE </p><p>INTIFADA.  ACCORDING TO THE CHARTER, HAMAS </p><p>CONSIDERS ALL OF PALESTINE AN ISLAMIC "WAQF," OR </p><p>TRUST FROM GOD.  CEDING ANY PART OF IT TO A </p><p>JEWISH STATE WOULD VIOLATE THAT TRUST.  HAMAS </p><p>OPPOSES THE TWO-STATE SOLUTION TOWARD WHICH THE </p><p>PLO SEEMS TO BE INCHING.  IT OPPOSES THE </p><p>CREATION OF A SECULAR STATE IN PALESTINE, AS </p><p>CALLED FOR IN THE PLO COVENANT.  INSTEAD, IT </p><p>DEMANDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ISLAMIC STATE. </p><p>IT ALSO OPPOSES CONVENING AN INTERNATIONAL PEACE </p><p>CONFERENCE.  AS HAMAS LEAFLET NO. 28 SUCCINCTLY </p><p>PHRASED IT, "NEGOTIATION WITH THE ENEMY IS </p><p>RETREAT AND CAPITULATION."  INSTEAD, HAMAS CALLS </p><p>FOR LIBERATING ALL OF PALESTINE THROUGH </p><p>JIHAD--BOTH ARMED STRUGGLE AND PROSELYTIZING. </p><p> </p><p>24.  THIS HAMAS/UNLU COMPETITION HAS LED TO A </p><p>BATTLE OF LEAFLETS AND STRIKE CALLS.  HAMAS </p><p>LEAFLETS EXCORIATE THE PLO--PARTICULARLY FATAH-- </p><p>AND THE UNLU FOR CAPITULATING TO THE ZIONIST </p><p>ENEMY.  UNLU, IN RESPONSE, ACCUSES HAMAS OF </p><p>SERVING ISRAEL BY DIVIDING THE UPRISING.  AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME, UNLU INVITES HAMAS TO JOIN THE </p><p>INTIFADA LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>25.  HAMAS, TO DATE, HAS REJECTED ALL CALLS FOR </p><p>UNITY WITH UNLU.  ONE EXCUSE OFTEN HEARD IS THAT </p><p>HAMAS WILL NOT SIT ON THE SAME COMMITTEE WITH </p><p>THE COMMUNISTS.  OTHERS SAY IT WILL NOT SIT WITH </p><p>ANY LEFTIST GROUP, SUCH AS THE PFLP.  OTHER </p><p>SOURCES, INCLUDING SOME CLOSE TO THE HAMAS </p><p>LEADERSHIP IN NABLUS, HAVE TOLD US HAMAS HAS </p><p>AGREED IN PRIVATE TO A TWO-STATE SOLUTION AND </p><p>WILL SOON JOIN NOT ONLY THE UNLU BUT THE PLO </p><p>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AS WELL.  ACCORDING TO THESE </p><p>REPORTS, HAMAS IS MAINTAINING ITS PUBLIC STANCE </p><p>IN OPPOSITION TO THE UNLU IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>ITS ORGANIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>24.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THERE ARE CONTACTS AND EVEN </p><p>OCCASIONAL COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. </p><p>HOWEVER, RECONCILIATION AND/OR UNITY BETWEEN </p><p>THEM SEEMS UNLIKELY AT THIS TIME.  HAMAS APPEARS </p><p>GENUINELY COMMITTED TO THE GOAL OF CREATING AN </p><p>ISLAMIC STATE IN ALL OF PALESTINE.  THIS IS A </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE WITH THE SECULAR </p><p>NATIONALISTS THAT CANNOT BE PAPERED OVER.  IT IS </p><p>THEREFORE LIKELY THAT THE UNLU AND HAMAS WOULD </p><p>FORGE A PERMANENT ALLIANCE. </p><p> </p><p>25.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, HAMAS RETAINS ITS FEAR OF </p><p>BEING COOPTED INTO THE NATIONALIST MOVEMENT AND </p><p>BECOMING IRRELEVANT.  THIS FEAR WAS ONE OF THE </p><p>MAIN FACTORS SPURRING THE CREATION OF HAMAS.  IT </p><p>IS IMPROBABLE THAT THE MB WOULD SACRIFICE ITS </p><p>CREATION NOW, JUST WHEN IT IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE </p><p>AS A PLAYER.  HOWEVER, SHOULD HAMAS FAIL TO </p><p>MAINTAIN ITS FOOTHOLD AND BECOME THREATENED WITH </p><p>EXTINCTION OR IRRELEVANCE, IT MIGHT AT THAT </p><p>POINT CONSIDER COOPERATING WITH THE SECULARIST </p><p>NATIONALIST LEADERSHIP OF THE UNLU FOR TACTICAL </p><p>REASONS. </p><p> </p><p>HAMAS--PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>26.  GAUGING THE CURRENT STRENGTH OF HAMAS IS A </p><p>RISKY ENDEAVOR.  IN MANY REGIONS OF THE WEST </p><p>BANK, ISLAMIC INSTITUTIONS ARE HELD IN HIGH </p><p>REGARD, AND SUPPORT FOR HAMAS APPEARS TO DERIVE </p><p>MUCH OF ITS STRENGTH FROM THAT TRADITIONAL </p><p>RESPECT RATHER THAN FROM A CONSCIOUS CHOICE </p><p>BETWEEN FUNDAMENTALIST AND SECULAR OPTIONS. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, HAMAS IS BEING TAKEN INCREASINGLY </p><p>SERIOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE WEST BANK.  WHETHER </p><p>THAT IS BECAUSE OF ACTUAL STRENGTH AND </p><p>INFLUENCE, OR MERELY DUE TO INSPIRED </p><p>SELF-PROMOTION, WE CANNOT SAY.  IN ANY CASE, IT </p><p>IS CLEAR THAT THE HAMAS PHENOMENON WILL BE A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN FUTURE CALCULATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>27.  ALTHOUGH ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM WILL REMAIN </p><p>A FEATURE OF THE WEST BANK LANDSCAPE, IMPORTANT </p><p>FACTORS WORK AGAINST IT BECOMING A PERVASIVE </p><p>INFLUENCE OR REPLACING THE SECULARIST STRAIN IN </p><p>WEST BANK POLITICS.  WEST BANKERS AS A WHOLE ARE </p><p>WELL EDUCATED, MUCH TRAVELED, AND CAPITALISTIC </p><p>IN ORIENTATION.  THEY ARE UNLIKELY WILLINGLY TO </p><p>TURN TO THE NARROW ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST WORLD </p><p>VIEW, NO MATTER HOW DEEP THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT </p><p>WITH THE PLO LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>28.  AS NOTED ABOVE, THE MB HAS HAD ONLY A BRIEF </p><p>AND UNDISTINGUISHED HISTORY IN THE WEST BANK. </p><p>IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT, THE INTIFADA ENJOYS </p><p>VERY WIDESPREAD SUPPORT AMONG WEST BANKERS, WHO </p><p>ARE GENERALLY OPPOSED TO ANY EFFORT TO DISRUPT </p><p>THIS UNITY AND THREATEN THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF </p><p>THE UPRISING.  THUS FAR, PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN </p><p>FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE UNLU AND HAMAS, AND </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE FUNDAMENTALISTS HAS BEEN </p><p>RELATIVELY COST FREE.  IN A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN THE </p><p>UNLU AND HAMAS, MUCH OF THAT SUPPORT COULD MELT </p><p>AWAY. </p><p> </p><p>29.  IN ADDITION THE WEST BANK, UNLIKE GAZA, </p><p>CONTAINS AN IMPORTANT CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  AS </p><p>NOTED ABOVE, HAMAS IS MEETING RESISTANCE IN THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN ENCLAVE OF BETHLEHEM-BEIT JALA-BEIT </p><p>SAHOUR, EVEN TO THE POINT OF STIMULATING THE </p><p>REACTIVATION OF A RIVAL CHRISTIAN GROUP.  STILL, </p><p>HAMAS HAS EXTENDED ITS INFLUENCE TO THE LARGELY </p><p>CHRISTIAN RAMALLAH-EL BIREH AREA, PROVING THAT </p><p>IT CAN SURVIVE IN A MIXED CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM </p><p>ENVIRONMENT.  THE CHRISTIAN CHARACTER OF THESE </p><p>AREAS IS ALSO SLOWLY BEING DILUTED AS CHRISTIANS </p><p>EMIGRATE TO FRIENDLIER CLIMES. </p><p> </p><p>30.  NONETHELESS, DESPITE THE FACTORS WORKING </p><p>AGAINST THE SPREAD OF FUNDAMENTALIST INFLUENCE, </p><p>THERE ARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH FUNDAMENTALIST </p><p>STRENGTH COULD GROW TO THE POINT THAT HAMAS </p><p>WOULD BECOME A SPOILER IN ATTEMPTS TO BRING </p><p>PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS TOGETHER.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>WIDESPREAD DECAPITATION THROUGH ARREST OF THE </p><p>UNLU LEADERSHIP IS NOT LIKELY, GIVEN ITS </p><p>OVERWHELMING POPULAR SUPPORT, ISRAELI EFFORTS TO </p><p>DO SO TEND TO PROMOTE HAMAS IN SPECIFIC AREAS, </p><p>SUCH AS IN THE EXAMPLE OF THE NEW ASKAR CAMP </p><p>GIVEN ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>31.  WEST BANKERS ARE BOTH RELIGIOUS AND </p><p>NATIONALISTIC.  THUS FAR, THEIR POLITICS HAVE </p><p>FOLLOWED THE NATIONALIST BENT OF THEIR CHARACTER </p><p>AND CULTURE.  THEY HAVE SUPPORTED THE PLO </p><p>BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE PLO IS THE ONLY VIABLE </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPRESSION OF </p><p>PALESTINIAN NATIONALISM.  THEY HAVE THEREFORE </p><p>CONTINUED TO BACK THE PLO DESPITE MANY </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENTS, AND THE MAJORITY ARE LIKELY TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO DO SO.  HOWEVER, SHOULD THE PLO FAIL </p><p>TO OVERCOME ITS IDEOLOGICAL DIVISIONS AND TAKE </p><p>INITIATIVES THAT WILL LEAD TO A POLITICAL </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH ISRAEL, THE UNITY OF THE INTIFADA </p><p>COULD BEGIN TO FRAY  ONE CAN IMAGINE A SCENARIO </p><p>IN WHICH PFLP, DFLP, AND COMMUNIST ELEMENTS IN </p><p>THE TERRITORIES, WHO ARE NOW WORKING WITH FATAH, </p><p>COULD REVERT TO MORE EXTREME POSITIONS IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF A POLITICAL BREAKTHROUGH.  IN SUCH A </p><p>SITUATION, THE SECULAR-NATIONALIST PRAGMATIC </p><p>CONSENSUS THAT IS THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF THE </p><p>INTIFADA COULD CRUMBLE, AND FUNDAMENTALISM COULD </p><p>MAKE SIGNIFICANT NEW INROADS, ESPECIALLY AMONG </p><p>DISPOSSESSED GROUPS.  THUS, ALTHOUGH A </p><p>MASS-BASED FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT IS UNLIKELY </p><p>TO EMERGE, THE FUNDAMENTALISTS COULD TAKE </p><p>ADVANTAGE OF GROWING DESPAIR AND SECULAR- </p><p>NATIONALIST DISUNITY TO FURTHER ITS POLICIES OF </p><p>CONFRONTATION AND REJECTION. </p><p> </p><p>32.  DESPITE THE AVOWED ANTI-ISRAELI INTENTIONS </p><p>OF HAMAS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE MAIN CONTEST </p><p>WILL, FOR THE TIME BEING, BE BETWEEN HAMAS AND </p><p>THE UNLU.  THE MB HAS TRADITIONALLY FOCUSED ON </p><p>ONE MAINSTREAM OPPONENT AT A TIME--THE WAFD IN </p><p>EGYPT, THE BAATH IN SYRIA.  ITS CURRENT OPPONENT </p><p>IN ITS STRUGGLE FOR THE SOULS OF PALESTINIANS IS </p><p>THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE UNLU, FATAH.  UNTIL </p><p>THIS STRUGGLE IS DECIDED, HAMAS IS UNLIKELY TO </p><p>DIRECT ITS EFFORTS PRIMARILY AGAINST ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>33.  THIS REPORT HAS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON </p><p>HAMAS/MB BOTH BECAUSE HAMAS IS THE MAIN </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP ON THE WEST BANK, AND </p><p>BECAUSE WE HAVE SO LITTLE INFORMATION ON THE </p><p>OTHER ISLAMIC PARTIES.  ISLAMIC JIHAD, THE ONLY </p><p>OTHER SUCH GROUP WITH A SIGNIFICANT WEST-BANK </p><p>FOLLOWING, WAS ESTABLISHED BY ABU JIHAD TO </p><p>ENHANCE FATAH\'S APPEAL WITH RELIGIOUS MUSLIMS. </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT HAS IN THE PAST CLAIMED INDEPENDENT </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTS SUCH AS THE OCTOBER 1986 </p><p>ATTACK AT THE DUNG GATE, IT WAS DECAPITATED WHEN </p><p>THREE SENIOR LEADERS WERE ASSASSINATED IN </p><p>CYPRUS.  OUR INFORMATION IS THAT ITS CURRENT </p><p>INFLUENCE ON THE WEST BANK IS MINOR AND THAT IT </p><p>IS INCAPABLE OF ACTING INDEPENDENTLY OF THE </p><p>MAINSTREAM FATAH ORGANIZATION ON THE WEST BANK. </p><p>IT SEEMS TO BE DOING MOST OF ITS ORGANIZING IN </p><p>WEST BANK PRISONS, WHERE A STRICT QUOTA SYSTEM </p><p>AMONG GROUPS IS ENFORCED BY THE PRISONERS.  WE </p><p>HAVE NO FIRM INFORMATION ON LINKS BETWEEN </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD ON THE WEST BANK AND IN GAZA, OR </p><p>WHETHER THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN FACT THE </p><p>SAME. </p><p> </p><p>QUESTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>34.  THIS BRIEF OVERVIEW OF ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST ACTIVITY ON THE WEST BANK DOES </p><p>NOT ADDRESS SEVERAL ISSUES OF CONTINUING </p><p>IMPORTANCE, SUCH AS KEY FIGURES IN MB/HAMAS AND </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD; COMMUNICATION BETWEEN HAMAS UNITS </p><p>IN VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE WEST BANK, GAZA, </p><p>CAIRO, AND AMMAN; THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD AND HAMAS IN THE WEST BANK AND </p><p>GAZA; AND FATAH-HAMAS RELATIONS.  WE WILL BE </p><p>EXPLORING THESE ISSUES IN FUTURE REPORTING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILCOX </p><p></p></div>
