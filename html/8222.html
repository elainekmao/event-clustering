<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001320 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DRL/CRA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA: 2002 RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>1.  Post recommends the following updates to the 2002 country </p><p>report on religious freedom for Guatemala: </p><p> </p><p>Section I. </p><p>---------- </p><p>No changes. </p><p> </p><p>Section II. </p><p>----------- </p><p>Legal/Policy Framework </p><p>Paragraph 1: Please replace "In April 2002, on the seventh </p><p>anniversary of the signing of the accord, the U.N. </p><p>Verification Mission noted that there had been little </p><p>progress in its implementation" with "In May 2003, the U.N. </p><p>Verification Mission noted in its presentation to the </p><p>international donor community at the Consultative Group that </p><p>the accord continued to face serious barriers to its </p><p>implementation." </p><p> </p><p>Restrictions on Religious Freedom </p><p>Paragraph 1: Please add as last sentence: "The Commission has </p><p>not taken action to protect any specific sacred sites since </p><p>its inception." </p><p> </p><p>Abuses of Religious Freedom </p><p>Paragraph 1 </p><p>Please replace entire paragraph with: </p><p>An appeal remains pending in the Constitutional Court </p><p>regarding the June 2001 conviction of three military officers </p><p>and an assistant priest for the 1998 murder of Bishop Juan </p><p>Gerardi, the Coordinator of the Archbishop\'s office on Human </p><p>Rights (ODHA).  In October 2002, an appeals court annulled </p><p>the 2001 conviction and ordered a retrial, which the ODHA </p><p>immediately appealed to the Supreme Court.  In February 2003, </p><p>the Supreme Court Appellate Chamber confirmed the June 2001 </p><p>trial, a decision which the defense then appealed to the </p><p>Constitutional Court. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 2 </p><p>Please replace entire paragraph with the following three </p><p>paragraphs: </p><p>There were multiple reports of assassinations of religious </p><p>leaders of various denominations over the last year, though </p><p>evidence has not surfaced in any of the cases to suggest that </p><p>the murders were related to the individuals\' religious </p><p>practices.  In October 2002, Mayan spiritual leader Antonio </p><p>Pop Caal was kidnapped and murdered in Coban, Alta Verapaz </p><p>province.  His alleged murderers are being held in custody </p><p>and a trial is pending.  In December 2002, Mayan priest </p><p>Marcos Sical Perez, was murdered by unknown assailants in </p><p>Salama, Baja Verapaz province.  An investigation is pending. </p><p> In April 2003, human rights activist and Mayan priest Diego </p><p>Xon Salazar was murdered in Chichicastenango, Quiche </p><p>province.  Xon Salazar had reportedly received multiple death </p><p>threats related to his work denouncing the resurgence of the </p><p>civilian defense patrols (ex-PACs) in the Quiche.  The </p><p>investigation of his murder is pending.  In May 2003, Mayan </p><p>priest Gerardo Camo Manuel was murdered during a religious </p><p>ceremony in Rabinal, Baja Verapaz province, after reportedly </p><p>receiving death threats from one or more members of his </p><p>community. </p><p> </p><p>Also in May 2003, evangelical pastor Oscar Armando Montiel </p><p>Montalvan was murdered during an evening service in his </p><p>parish in San Juan Sacatepequez, Sacatepequez province. </p><p>While the police continue to investigate the crime, none of </p><p>his congregation has testified to the identity of the </p><p>assailants, leading the police to speculate that witnesses </p><p>fear retribution.  Catholic priest Edgar Estuardo del Cid was </p><p>kidnapped, detained, and threatened for several hours along </p><p>with three parishioners in Guanagazapa, Escuintla province. </p><p>In the report filed with the Public Ministry, the victims </p><p>attributed the crime to del Cid\'s criticism of social </p><p>injustice during his homilies. </p><p> </p><p>While these crimes have not been linked to religious </p><p>persecution, they do represent a disturbing trend of </p><p>targeting voices of dissent against the corruption and </p><p>impunity that plague Guatemalan society. </p><p> </p><p>Section III. </p><p>------------ </p><p>Paragraph 1: Final sentence, delete "lynching," replace "such </p><p>activities against" with "attacks on" </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 3: Replace first sentence with, "Within the Jewish </p><p>community, there were no reported incidents of Anti-Semitism." </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 4: Delete first sentence. </p><p> </p><p>Paragraph 6 </p><p>Please insert, "The Ecumenical Forum\'s leadership council </p><p>continues to meet on a monthly basis, maintaining dialogue </p><p>between most religious groups operating in Guatemala." </p><p>Section IV. </p><p>----------- </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
