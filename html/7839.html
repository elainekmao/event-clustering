Karaboga </p><p>claimed Iran exported a large quantity of goods </p><p>to Iraq and Syria sent many trucks of TV-dishes </p><p>that had been banned in Iraq for 15 years. </p><p>Karaboga added that the Habur Border Gate had </p><p>been closed since September 11, 2001, for </p><p>security considerations.
