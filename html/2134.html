STATE 184178 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05693  01 OF 02  021700Z </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR. REASON 1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: SOUTH ASIA BUREAU AFGHANISTAN COORDINATOR </p><p>JOINED AMBASSADOR TO BRIEF VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>10/20 ON U.S. EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN.  DFM NOTED THE </p><p>VATICAN WAS ARRANGING A 10/28-10/29 INTERFAITH MEETING IN </p><p>CAIRO OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS THAT WOULD ALSO ADDRESS 9/11 AND </p><p>ITS AFTERMATH.  DFM SKETCHED VARIOUS VATICAN CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>OF EMERGENCY HUMANITARIAN AID TO AFGHAN REFUGEES.  DFM </p><p>INDICATED THERE ARE TWO OR THREE NUNS CURRENTLY WORKING IN </p><p>A KABUL HOSPITAL.  DFM EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE KASHMIR </p><p>SITUATION AND AFGHAN MILITARY CAMPAIGN COULD DESTABILIZE </p><p>THE GOP, WITH REPERCUSSIONS FOR PAKISTAN\'S SIZEABLE </p><p>CATHOLIC MINORITY. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SOUTH ASIA BUREAU AFGHANISTAN COORDINATOR JEFFREY </p><p>J. LUNSTEAD AND AMBASSADOR BRIEFED VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY </p><p>OFFICIALS 10/20 ON U.S. EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN. THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND LUNSTEAD SAW MONSIGNOR CELESTINO MIGLIORE, </p><p>DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER-EQUIVALENT, AND EAST ASIA AND </p><p>AFGHANISTAN DESK OFFICER MONSIGNOR LUIS MARRANO DE </p><p>MONTEMAYOR; AFGHANISTAN DESK OFFICER GEETA PASI AND EMBOFF </p><p>ALSO ATTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DFM MIGLIORE SPOKE POSITIVELY OF THE CIRCUMSPECTION </p><p>EVIDENT IN THE U.S. RESPONSE, THOUGH HE NOTED THAT THE HOLY </p><p>SEE COULD NEVER APPLAUD WARFARE.  WITHIN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>BODIES, SUCH AS THE U.N., THE HOLY SEE WOULD SUPPORT </p><p>FURTHER POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL INITIATIVES.  WHERE THE </p><p>HOLY SEE COULD PLAY A DIRECT LEADERSHIP ROLE WAS IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05693  01 OF 02  021700Z </p><p>CULTURAL AFFAIRS, SPECIICALLY THROUGH INTER-RELIGIOUS </p><p>DIALOGUE, MIGLIORE SAID.  HE INDICATED THAT THE </p><p>CONGREGATION FOR RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE, AN INSTITUTIONAL ARM </p><p>OF THE VATICAN, WAS ORGANIZING A MEETING OF ISLAMIC AND </p><p>CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS LEADERS AT AL-AZHAR UNIVERSITY IN </p><p>CAIRO. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MIGLIORE SHARED CONCERNS THAT THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN </p><p>WAS OUTSTRIPPING POLITICAL STRATEGIES.  HE OBSERVED THAT </p><p>NEIGHBORING NATIONS IN FACT SHARED FEW COMMON INTERESTS, AN </p><p>IMPEDIMENT TO ANY TRUE REGIONAL COALITION.  ADDRESSING THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY, MIGLIORE VOLUNTEERED THAT IT </p><p>PREDATED THE PRESENT MILITARY CAMPAIGN.  WINTERTIME, HE </p><p>ADDED, WOULD SEE A DRAMATIC WORSENING.  THE VATICAN IS </p><p>CONTRIBUTING AND COORDINATING SOME RELIEF ASSISTANCE, </p><p>THROUGH CARITAS AND COR UNUM (LOOSELY, VATICAN EQUIVALENTS </p><p>TO USAID).  CARITAS,J\'E SQD, HAS AN INFORMAL PRESENCE IN </p><p>TEHERAN.  ALSO, THE SOVEREIGN MILITARY ORDER OF THE KNIGHTS </p><p>OF MALTA (SMOM) IS SET TO INITIATE HUMANITARIAN WORK IN </p><p>IRAN.  SUCH EFFORTS CONSTITUTE EMERGENCY AID ONLY, MIGLIORE </p><p>SAID; A FINAL POLITICAL SOLUTION IS IMPERATIVE.  MOREOVER, </p><p>HE DREADED GLOBAL ECONOMIC COLLAPSE SHOULD THE MILITARY </p><p>CAMPAIGN EXTEND TO IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) LUNSTEAD SOUGHT INFORMATION ON VATICAN </p><p>PERSONNEL/ECCLESIASTICS STILL IN AFGHANISTAN.  MONTEMAYOR </p><p>STATED THERE WERE THREE NUNS BEFORE MIGLIORE CORRECTED HIM </p><p>THAT ONLY TWO REMAIN, THE THIRD HAVING LEFT FOR FRANCE ON </p><p>MEDICAL GROUNDS.  THE VATICAN HAS NO EASY MEANS TO CONTACT </p><p>THE NUNS, MONTEMAYOR CLAIMED.  THEY WERE FOREIGN NATIONALS, </p><p>LONG RESIDENT IN AFGHANISTAN, AND CURRENTLY WORKING IN THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05693  01 OF 02  021700Z </p><p>INDIRA GANDHI HOSPITAL IN KABUL.  (COMMENT:  MONTEMAYOR </p><p>LATER PHONED EMBOFF TO RELATE THERE ARE INDEED THREE NUNS </p><p>IN KABUL, AFFILIATED WITH INDIRA GANDHI AND A CLINIC BY THE </p><p>NAME OF ALI ABAD.  THE NUNS ARE MEMBERS OF THE LITTLE </p><p>SISTERS OF JESUS. THE VATICAN REQUESTED WE NOT PUBLICIZE </p><p>THEIR PRESENCE IN KABUL.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MIGLIORE ASKED LUNSTEAD\'S THINKING ON KASHMIR. </p><p>LUNSTEAD CONCEDED THE PROBLEM WAS GRAVE; CERTAIN TERRORISTS </p><p>IN KASHMIR HAD RECEIVED TRAINING IN PAKISTAN AND IN AL- </p><p>QAIDA CAMPS.  THE SECRETARY, HE NOTED, HAD CONDEMNED ALL </p><p>TERRORISM.  GENERAL MUSHARRAFF, HE SUGGESTED, NOW HAD A </p><p>UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CURB EXTREMIST ELEMENTS IN HIS </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>7.   (C) MIGLIORE REQUESTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HUMANITARIAN CAMPAIGN.  LUNDSTEAD </p><p>CONCEDED THERE WERE SEVERE PROBLEMS.  THE SEPTEMBER </p><p>DEPARTURE OF NON-AFGHAN AID WORKERS CAPABLE OF MANAGING </p><p>SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION WAS A COMPLICATING FACTOR. </p><p>MOREOVER, RECENT TALIBAN ACTIONS -- SEIZING WAREHOUSES AND </p><p>BEATING AFGHAN AID WORKERS -- WAS DEEPLY DISTURBING.  THE </p><p>TALIBAN\'S LONGSTANDING LACK OF CONCERN FOR THE AFGHAN </p><p>POPULATION WAS SIGNIFICANT, HE ADDED, WITH THE OUTSIDE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7681 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  05693  02 OF 02  021700Z </p><p>ACTION SA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   OIGO-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   MED-07   AC-01    NEA-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  ACE-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    EPAE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------392832  021704Z /38 </p><p>O 021655Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0000 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ISLAMABAD </p><p>AMEMBASSY NEW DELHI </p><p>AMEMBASSY CAIRO </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 005693 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/PAB (PASI), EUR/WE (D.MENNUTI), S/P (VAN CLEVE) </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 192/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 10/23/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AF, PK, IN, VT </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTH ASIA BUREAU AFGHANISTAN COORDINATOR </p><p>BRIEFS VATICAN. </p><p> </p><p>WORLD STEPPING INTO THE GAP.  HE ADMITTED THAT AIRDROPS TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05693  02 OF 02  021700Z </p><p>REMOTE SPOTS WERE NOT AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION, YET ADDED </p><p>THESE CONSTITUTED A VALUABLE DEMONSTRATION.  CONCERN RUNS </p><p>HIGH IN IRAN AND PAKISTAN AT A SURGE IN REFUGEES, YET </p><p>MEASURES WERE BEING TAKEN, INCLUDING UNHCR CONSTRUCTION OF </p><p>NEW REFUGEE SITES, IF NEEDED, LUNDSTEAD SAID.  THUS FAR, </p><p>THE FLOW OF NEW REFUGEES HAS REMAINED LOW. </p><p> </p><p>8.   (C) LUNSTEAD, AT THE AMBASSADOR\'S ENCOURAGEMENT, </p><p>REMARKED BRIEFLY ON HIS 10/19 ENCOUNTER WITH THE KING.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED THE KING AS PHYSICALLY FRAIL BUT MENTALLY ACUTE, </p><p>WITH NO DESIRE TO RETURN TO RULE IN AFGHANISTAN, JUST AN </p><p>EXILE\'S HOPE FOR BURIAL IN HIS HOMELAND.  HIS ENTOURAGE WAS </p><p>HAMPERED BY INTRIGUE, LUNSTEAD ADDED. ASKED BY MIGLIORE IF </p><p>THE KING WERE WILLING TO ASSUME LEADERSHIP, LUNDSTEAD </p><p>ANSWERED THAT THE KING KNEW HE WOULD NEVER RULE AGAIN BUT </p><p>VIEWED HIS ROLE AS THAT OF A CATALYST.  HE WAS AN OLD MAN, </p><p>WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT SECURITY THREATS THAT KEPT HIM FROM </p><p>HIS DAILY GARDEN STROLL.  THE U.S. HARBORED NO ILLUSIONS, </p><p>LUNSTEAD SAID, ADDING THE KING\'S ENTOURAGE HAD BEEF </p><p>IRRESOLUTE IN THE PAST. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ASKED TO EXPAND ON THE AFOREMENTIONED CAIRO </p><p>ENCOUNTER, MIGLIORE STIPULATED THE 10/28-10/29 AL-AZHAR </p><p>MEETING WOULD BE AN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION AND WOULD RESPOND </p><p>TO SEPTEMBER 11 AND ITS AFTERMATH.  MIGLIORE EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT THE HOLY SEE IS A SPIRITUAL, ETHICAL AND MORAL ENTITY, </p><p>WHOSE MISSION IS NOT POLITICAL BUT RELIGIOUS.  THE MASSES </p><p>IN ISLAMIC SOCIETIES, HE OBSERVED, DEPEND ON RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERSHIP; IF RELIGIOUS LEADERS WILL NOT DISTANCE </p><p>THEMSELVES FROM VIOLENCE, THEN NEITHER WILL THE POPULATION </p><p>AT LARGE.  MIGLIORE SUGGESTED THE HOLY SEE CAN PLAY A ROLE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05693  02 OF 02  021700Z </p><p>TO CONVINCE RELIGIOUS COUNTERPARTS TO REPUDIATE VIOLENCE. </p><p>MIGLIORE LEVIED FAINT PRAISE AT A SIMILAR EFFORT HELD BY </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO 10/3-10/4 IN ROME. (COMMENT:  SANT\'EGIDIO IS A </p><p>PROMINENT ROME-BASED CATHOLIC NGO FAMED FOR CONFLICT </p><p>RESOLUTION, NOTABLY THE PEACEFUL END TO THE MOZAMBIQUE </p><p>CIVIL WAR BROKERED IN 1993.)  MIGLIORE LAUDED SANT\'EGIDIO\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO GATHER ISLAMIC LEADERS QUICKLY, YET HE </p><p>QUESTIONED THE VALUE OF A GET-TOGETHER THAT DID NOT PRODUCE </p><p>A PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE, NOT JUST A DOCUMENT </p><p>SIGNED IN ENGLISH THAT WOULD NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY IN </p><p>PARTICIPANT\'S HOME COUNTRIES.  MAYBE FUTURE SANT\'EGIDIO </p><p>MEETINGS WOULD BE MORE CONSTRUCTIVE, MIGLIORE MUSED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE CURRENT MILITARY ACTIVITY IS NOT DIRECTED </p><p>AGAINST AFGHANS OR ISLAM BUT TERRORISM.  WHILE COMMITTED TO </p><p>THE COALITION, MUSHARRAF FACES DOMESTIC PRESSURE BECAUSE </p><p>PAKISTANIS OPPOSE THE AIR CAMPAIGN, AND HE HAS CALLED FOR </p><p>ITS EARLY END.  MONTEMAYOR REMARKED CATHOLIC LEADERSHIP </p><p>LIKQ7I#5=AQ\'M.  MIGLIORE WORRIED FURTHER AT </p><p>THE RISK TO PAKISTAN\'S STABILITY AND TO ITS ONE MILLION- </p><p>STRONG CATHOLIC POPULATION. LUNDSTEAD HOWEVER VOICED </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN GENERAL MUSHARRAFF, PRAISING HIS SWIFT </p><p>REPUDIATION OF THE TALIBAN, A TURNAROUND THAT RAISES HOPES </p><p>MUSHARRAFF WILL NOW ALSO FACE DOWN RADICAL ISLAM WITHIN </p><p>PAKISTAN, THEREBY ALSO BETTERING CONDITIONS FOR PAKISTAN\'S </p><p>RELIGIOUS MINORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE OFFICE OF THE SOUTH ASIA BUREAU AFGHANISTAN </p><p>COORDINATOR HAS CLEARED THIS CABLE. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05693  02 OF 02  021700Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA05693 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
