MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  03-07-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PHUM, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Recent peace process-related meetings </p><p>involving LTTE help a bit in improving atmosphere </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 374, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  After a March 5 meeting with the </p><p>Norwegian-led monitors, the Tamil Tigers released two </p><p>security force personnel from detention.  In an earlier </p><p>meeting with UNICEF, the Tigers agreed to move forward </p><p>with an "action plan" aimed at ending the use of child </p><p>soldiers.  In other news, the monitors have a new chief, </p><p>Tryggve Tellefsen, a retired Norwegian general.  Amid </p><p>the recent concerns about the state of the GSL\'s peace </p><p>initiative, the latest meetings with the Tigers have </p><p>helped a bit in confidence-building.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) RELEASE OF SECURITY FORCE PERSONNEL:  Recent </p><p>peace process-related meetings involving the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have proven relatively </p><p>constructive.  In a March 5 meeting in the LTTE- </p><p>controlled Wanni region, for example, officials of the </p><p>Norwegian-run Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) </p><p>strongly urged LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran and chief </p><p>negotiator Anton Balasingham to release a GSL soldier </p><p>and policeman from custody.  (Note:  The two security </p><p>force personnel had been captured in separate incidents </p><p>and held for some weeks.  The LTTE had promised to free </p><p>them on several occasions.)  Hours after the meeting </p><p>concluded, the Tigers released the two men.  In </p><p>announcing their release, the Tigers stated that the </p><p>move was a "goodwill gesture to the SLMM, a recognition </p><p>of SLMM authority, and a sign of dedication to the </p><p>(February 2002) ceasefire agreement and the peace </p><p>process." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The holding of the two men by the LTTE had been </p><p>a cause celebre, with the anti-peace process press in </p><p>the south loudly demanding their release.  The </p><p>announcement that the men had been freed elicited some </p><p>positive press for the government\'s peace initiative. </p><p>Jehan Perera of the National Peace Council, a local NGO, </p><p>told us that he thought the move was "quite </p><p>constructive" in that it indicated some respect on the </p><p>part of the Tigers for the SLMM\'s mandate.  (Note:  The </p><p>LTTE\'s willingness to work closely with the SLMM had </p><p>been subject to serious question of late, especially </p><p>when SLMM monitors were forced to jump off an arms- </p><p>smuggling boat, which had been set on fire by Tiger </p><p>personnel during a February incident.  The Tiger </p><p>personnel subsequently blew themselves up and the boat </p><p>sank.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) MEETING RE CHILD SOLDIERS:  In another meeting </p><p>that wrapped up in seemingly positive fashion, </p><p>representatives of UNICEF met with LTTE political chief </p><p>S.P. Thamilchelvam on March 4 in the Wanni.  At the </p><p>conclusion of the meeting, the Tigers agreed to finish </p><p>work on an "action plan" focused on ending the use of </p><p>child soldiers.  The Tigers also agreed to send </p><p>personnel to workshops and training sessions on the </p><p>issue in coming weeks.  UNICEF and the Tigers also </p><p>agreed to establish "transit centers" to facilitate the </p><p>return to society of children released from LTTE ranks. </p><p>At the close of the meeting, Thamilchelvam was quoted as </p><p>stating the following: </p><p> </p><p>"Our commitment to all children affected by war and not </p><p>to recruit children has been firm and remains firm.  The </p><p>LTTE has informed all military commanders and heads of </p><p>political sections in writing regarding the policy not </p><p>to recruit children under the age of 18." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) UNICEF seemed very enthusiastic about the </p><p>outcome of the meeting.  UNICEF assistant program </p><p>officer Sarah Lendon told us that the meeting was held </p><p>in a very cordial atmosphere, with the Tigers seeming to </p><p>want to cooperate fully.  She noted that the meeting had </p><p>resulted in a bit of a "breakthrough" in that for the </p><p>first time the LTTE had agreed to "concrete measures" </p><p>(e.g., agreeing to workshops, setting up transit </p><p>centers) to deal with the child soldier issue.  Lendon </p><p>acknowledged that the Tigers had made promises to reform </p><p>their behavior in this area before and had failed to </p><p>carry through on them. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) NEW HEAD OF SLMM:  In other peace process- </p><p>related news, the SLMM has a new chief.  On March 7, </p><p>Tryggve Tellefsen, a retired Norwegian army major </p><p>general, took over as SLMM head of mission.  Tellefsen </p><p>replaces Trond Furuhovde, another retired Norwegian </p><p>general, who had served as chief of the SLMM since the </p><p>group began operations last year.  As with Furuhovde, </p><p>Tellefsen is quite experienced in peacekeeping missions: </p><p>He served as commander of the Multinational Force and </p><p>Observers (MFO) monitoring the Egypt/Israel peace treaty </p><p>from 1997-2001 and in Macedonia with UNPROFOR from </p><p>1994-95. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  As reviewed in Reftels, there has been </p><p>a sour mood surrounding the peace process of late, with </p><p>many in the south -- and the international community -- </p><p>deeply worried about the LTTE and its commitment to </p><p>peace.  Against this backdrop, the latest meetings with </p><p>the Tigers have helped a bit in confidence-building.  It </p><p>seems possible that this somewhat more constructive </p><p>trend on the part of the Tigers could ease the situation </p><p>a bit as the parties prepare for the next main event, </p><p>i.e., the sixth round of GSL-LTTE talks, which is </p><p>scheduled to take place March 18-21 in Japan.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
