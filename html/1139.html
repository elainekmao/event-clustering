IRVING FOR REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) A DOWNCAST MICHIEL SALOMONS (PROTECT) BRIEFED DCM </p><p>ON JUNE 13 ON WHAT HE VIEWS AS A WORSENING OUTLOOK FOR </p><p>THE RESOLUTION OF THE CASES OF CUBAN DOCTORS LEONEL </p><p>CORDOVA RODRIGUEZ AND NORIS DEL CARMEN PENA MARTINEZ. </p><p>SALOMONS, WHO CONTINUES TO GET THE RUNAROUND FROM </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN AUTHORITIES, ALSO SPECULATED THAT THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR) IN GENEVA </p><p>MIGHT DROP THE CASE.  HE EXPLAINED THAT UNHCR HEAD OGATA </p><p>HAD VISITED HAVANA RECENTLY IN AN EFFORT TO SECURE </p><p>CUBA\'S ACCESSION TO THE 1951 CONVENTION CONCERNING </p><p>REFUGEES.  MS. OGATA FOUND FIDEL CASTRO IMPRESSIVE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO SALOMONS.  CASTRO IN TURN PROMISED MS. </p><p>OGATA "HUNDREDS" OF CUBAN DOCTORS TO ASSIST UNHCR, A </p><p>DANGLED ATTRACTION WHICH MAY NOW BE INFLUENCING MS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03164  01 OF 02  131457Z </p><p>OGATA\'S PROFESSIONAL AND IMPARTIAL VIEW OF THE FATE OF </p><p>THE DOCTORS BEING HELD IN LOCAL DETENTION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SALOMONS ALSO TOLD US THAT HE HAD BEEN INFORMED </p><p>THAT THE QUESTION OF THE RELEASE OF THE CUBAN DOCTORS </p><p>COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE CABINET IN ITS REGULAR </p><p>WEEKLY MEETING ON JUNE 13.  IF THE CABINET DOES NOT ACT </p><p>ON IT TODAY, SALOMONS THOUGHT IT WOULD ONLY RETURN TO </p><p>THE ISSUE OF THE CUBANS\' PLIGHT AFTER THE ELECTIONS.  HE </p><p>SPOKE OMINOUSLY OF A CUBAN TRANSPORT PLANE BEING MOVED </p><p>FROM GABON TO ZIMBABWE IMMINENTLY TO FORCIBLY REPATRIATE </p><p>THE PAIR TO CUBA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) SALOMONS THOUGHT THAT IF THE U.S. REALLY WISHED </p><p>TO GRANT ASYLUM TO THE CUBANS, THEN IT SHOULD ENGAGE </p><p>DIRECTLY WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE, BECAUSE HE BELIEVED </p><p>CASTRO WAS ALREADY DOING SO.  LEFT TO UNHCR, THE CASE </p><p>MIGHT GO TWO WAYS.  ZIMBABWE WOULD GRANT TO THE UNHCR </p><p>"MANDATE STATUS", MEANING THE UN COULD RETURN THE PAIR </p><p>TO CUBA, RELYING ON THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT\'S PUBLIC </p><p>PROMISE THAT NO HARM WOULD BEFALL THEM AS THEY HAD </p><p>COMMITTED NO CRIME, OR, THE PAIR COULD BE SETTLED IN A </p><p>THIRD COUNTRY.  EVEN THOUGH SALOMONS HAD ARGUED THAT THE </p><p>TWO CUBANS WERE BONA FIDE REFUGEES, HE THOUGHT THE USG </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO PRESS UNHCR HARD TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY </p><p>HAD A WELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION IF RETURNED TO </p><p>THEIR HOMELAND. SALOMONS STATED THAT THE CUBANS HAD BEEN </p><p>MODEL CITIZENS IN CUBA AND THAT THEIR CLAIM FOR REFUGEE </p><p>STATUS ONLY AROSE AFTER THEY MADE ANTI-CASTRO REMARKS TO </p><p>THE NEWSPAPERS IN ZIMBABWE. FINALLY, SALOMONS PROPOSED A </p><p>"LOCAL SETTLEMENT", IN, WHICH THE CUBANS MIGHT BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03164  01 OF 02  131457Z </p><p>ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN ZIMBABWE NOT FOR TWO WEEKS, BUT FOR </p><p>PERHAPS A YEAR, AS HAD BEEN THE CASE WITH CUBAN DOCTORS </p><p>WHO DEFECTED IN VENEZUELA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) IN WHAT WE VIEW AS A POSSIBLE FURTHER MUDDYING </p><p>OF THE WATERS, THE TEACHER (MADZIYA) WITH WHOM THE </p><p>CUBANS HAD BEEN STAYING TELEPHONED THE EMBASSY TODAY. </p><p>HE TOLD US THAT A POLICE SERGEANT CHIDHARARA AT </p><p>GOROMONZI DETECTION CENTER HAD BEEN IN TOUCH TO REQUEST </p><p>THAT MADZIYA TURN OVER THE CUBANS\' PASSPORTS, MONEY AND </p><p>ANY OTHER BELONGINGS IN HIS POSSESSION.  HE DID NOT </p><p>STATE IF THE REASON BEHIND HIS REQUEST WAS AN IMPENDING </p><p>DEPARTURE FROM ZIMBABWE, OR A LIKELY EXTENDED STAY AS A </p><p>GUEST OF HIS FACILITY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: SALOMONS CAME LATE TO THE REALIZATION </p><p>OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CASE, AS EVIDENCED BY HIS </p><p>OFFHAND COMMENT TO INS OFFICER VARSANI THAT HE WAS </p><p>SURPRISED BY THE AMOUNT OF PUBLICITY THAT THE CUBANS\' </p><p>CASE HAS GENERATED.  SALOMONS APPEARS UNABLE TO </p><p>ANTICIPATE OR DECIPHER THE POLITICAL ENDGAMES BEING </p><p>PLAYED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND UNFORTUNATELY HIS </p><p>MALADROITNESS TRANSLATES INTO ANOTHER WEAK LINK IN THE </p><p>CHAIN.  NEVERTHELESS, WE CANNOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBLE </p><p>SCENARIOS HE HAS OUTLINED, OR THE VALIDITY OF HIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5987 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03164  02 OF 02  131457Z </p><p>ACTION PRM-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00 </p><p>      INL-01   DODE-00  DOEE-00  ANHR-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   OIGO-02  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      IIP-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /012W </p><p>                  ------------------6248A3  131458Z /38 </p><p>O 131502Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6302 </p><p>INFO USINT HAVANA IMMEDIATE </p><p>COMMISSIONER USINS WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CAIRO </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABIDJAN </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003164 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM A/S TAFT, PRM/A, PRM/AAA, AF/S, AF/PD, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03164  02 OF 02  131457Z </p><p>WHA/CCA </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR REFCOORD AND INS </p><p> </p><p>ROME FOR INS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/13/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, ZI, CU </p><p>SUBJECT: UNHCR LAWYER SKETCHES OUT POSSIBLE END GAME FOR </p><p>CUBAN DOCTORS </p><p> </p><p>INFORMATION REGARDING MS.
