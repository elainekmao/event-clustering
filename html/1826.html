CLAPP, </p><p>REASON:  1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  THE CHINESE DCM TOLD US THE PRC </p><p>CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE ONGOING POLITICAL DIALOGUE, </p><p>AND BELIEVES THE MILITARY REGIME IS SINCERE IN ITS </p><p>DEALINGS WITH AUNG SAN SUU KYI (ASSK).  WHILE HE </p><p>STATED HIS BELIEF THAT OUTSIDE PRESSURE IS COUNTER- </p><p>PRODUCTIVE, HE GAVE SOME REASON TO BELIEVE BEIJING </p><p>MIGHT PROVIDE DISCREET SUPPORT FOR RAZALI\'S </p><p>INITIATIVE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE DIALOGUE </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  CHINESE DCM TANG YING TOLD DCM ON 26 JULY </p><p>THAT CHINA CLOSELY FOLLOWS POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN </p><p>BURMA AND HAS BEEN CONCERNED FOR SOME TIME ABOUT </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STABILITY IN THIS COUNTRY (REF </p><p>A).  ACCORDING TO TANG, THE PRC SEES BURMA\'S </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM AS POLITICAL. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        RANGOO  01171  01 OF 02  282145Z </p><p>3.  (C)  TANG NOTED THAT BEIJING WELCOMES THE </p><p>DIALOGUE BETWEEN ASSK AND THE RULING STATE PEACE AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL (SPDC) AND HOPES THAT IT WILL, </p><p>OVER TIME, LEAD TO A MORE STABLE POLITICAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENT WHICH WILL PERMIT BURMA TO DEVELOP MORE </p><p>RAPIDLY ECONOMICALLY.  HIS GOVERNMENT WAS PLEASED TO </p><p>SEE THE RELEASE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND REOPENING </p><p>OF A HANDFUL OF NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY (NLD) </p><p>LOCAL OFFICES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  TANG BELIEVES THAT THE SENIOR SPDC </p><p>LEADERSHIP IS QUITE SERIOUS AND SINCERE ABOUT TRYING </p><p>TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NLD THAT WOULD RESOLVE </p><p>THE POLITICAL IMPASSE.  HE BELIEVES THE SPDC IS </p><p>TAKING A LARGE RISK IN ENGAGING IN TALKS, BOTH </p><p>BECAUSE IT MAY CAUSE DISSENTION WITHIN THE MILITARY </p><p>ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED, AND BECAUSE IT RISKS FURTHER </p><p>PRESSURE AND CONDEMNATION FROM THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY IF THE TALKS FAIL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  TANG ASSERTED THAT THE RESOLUTION OF BURMA\'S </p><p>POLITICAL PROBLEMS IS PRIMARILY A DOMESTIC ISSUE, </p><p>WHICH MUST BE RESOLVED BY THE VARIOUS BURMESE </p><p>PARTIES.  HE STRESSED THAT FROM BEIJING\'S </p><p>PERSPECTIVE, OUTSIDE PRESSURE OR INTERFERENCE COULD </p><p>IN FACT COMPLICATE BURMESE RESOLUTION OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL STALEMATE IN THE COUNTRY.  HE SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT THE BEST THING THE USG COULD DO AT THIS STAGE </p><p>WAS TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT THE PROCESS.  HE BELIEVED </p><p>THIS WAS THE BEST WAY TO ENCOURAGE THE SPDC TO TAKE </p><p>FURTHER STEPS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        RANGOO  01171  01 OF 02  282145Z </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  TANG NOTED THAT CHINA WAS INTERESTED IN THE </p><p>RAZALI PROCESS, BUT DID NOT OFFER A STRONG STATEMENT </p><p>OF SUPPORT FOR IT, EVEN AFTER OUR BEING TOLD OF THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE THE USG ATTACHES TO THIS INITIATIVE.  HE </p><p>DID SAY THAT THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR HAD TRIED TO </p><p>ATTEND RAZALI\'S BRIEFING DURING HIS JUNE VISIT, BUT </p><p>MISSED IT WHEN HE DID NOT RECEIVE WORD ON THE CHANGED </p><p>TIME AND LOCATION OF THE BRIEFING. </p><p> </p><p>RECENT CHINESE OFFICIAL VISITS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  TANG EXPLAINED THAT THE RECENT TRAVEL OF </p><p>YUNNAN PROVINCIAL VICE GOVERNOR SHAO QIWEI TO BURMA </p><p>WAS TO INSPECT THE PAUNGLAUNG HYDROPOWER PLANT.  TANG </p><p>DECLINED TO ESTIMATE WHEN THIS PLANT (WHICH IS BEHIND </p><p>SCHEDULE) MIGHT BE PUT INTO SERVICE.  HE NOTED THAT </p><p>THE RECENT VISIT OF THE MINISTER FOR RURAL PLANNING </p><p>AND LAND USE HAD RESULTED IN AN MOU TO COOPERATE IN </p><p>MINING.

(C)  REGARDING THE PLANNED KUNMING ANTI-NARCOTICS </p><p>SUMMIT INVOLVING CHINA, BURMA, LAOS, AND THAILAND, </p><p>TANG SAID PREPARATIONS ARE PROCEEDING.  WHILE NOT YET </p><p>SCHEDULED, THERE WILL BE A SENIOR OFFICIALS MEETING, </p><p>FOLLOWED BY A MINISTERIAL, AND THEN THE ACTUAL </p><p>MEETING INVOLVING HEADS OF GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  COMMENT:  AS NOTED IN REF B, RAZALI MAY BE </p><p>INTERESTED IN PURSUING CHINESE SUPPORT FOR HIS </p><p>INITIATIVE.  OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH TANG LEAD US TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT, WHILE THERE WILL BE DISTINCT LIMITS TO </p><p>CHINESE WILLINGNESS TO PUSH FOR CHANGE PUBLICLY, THE </p><p>CHINESE EMBASSY HERE MAY BE WILLING TO QUIETLY </p><p>SUPPORT THE PROCESS.  TANG HAS TOLD US PREVIOUSLY </p><p>THAT HE AND OTHER EMBASSY OFFICERS HAVE ADVOCATED FOR </p><p>BASIC REFORM IN INFORMAL CONTACTS WITH BURMESE </p><p>COUNTERPARTS.  AS A MAJOR SUPPORTER OF THE SPDC, </p><p>CHINESE VIEWS, HOWEVER DISCREETLY THEY MAY BE </p><p>TRANSMITTED, ARE LIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPACT.  FROM THE </p><p>CHINESE STANDPOINT, A MORE STABLE AND ECONOMICALLY </p><p>VIBRANT BURMA WOULD MAKE A BETTER NEIGHBOR. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        RANGOO  01171  02 OF 02  282146Z </p><p>CLAPP </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p>      2001RANGOO01171 - CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p></div>
