THE AUGUST 9 EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" </p><p>   CARRIES A PAGE-ONE STORY ABOUT BUSINESSMAN STRIVE </p><p>   MASIYIWA\'S 1990 DETENTION BY MEMBERS OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>   CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO).  THE STORY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04446  091253Z </p><p>   LINKS MASIYIWA\'S DETENTION TO A RECENT ALLEGED </p><p>   ASSASSINATION THREAT TO "DAILY NEWS" EDITOR GEOFF </p><p>   NYAROTA.  ACCORDING TO THE NEWS STORY, THE LINK IS THAT </p><p>   MASIYIWA\'S ABDUCTOR IN 1990, ROBERT MANUNGO, IS THE </p><p>   PERSON NYAROTA\'S WOULD-BE KILLER ALLEGED GAVE HIM THE </p><p>   ASSASSINATION ASSIGNMENT. </p><p>2. STRIVE MASIYIWA IS THE CEO OF ECONET WIRELESS HOLDINGS, </p><p>   AND ONE OF ZIMBABWE\'S MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMEN.  HE </p><p>   HAS A LONG HISTORY OF STRUGGLING AGAINST GOVERNMENT </p><p>   BUREAUCRACY AND CORRUPTION, AND HAS BEEN IN SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>   FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BECAUSE OF HIS FEAR THAT HE WOULD BE </p><p>   ARRESTED FOR POLITICAL REASONS IF HE RETURNS TO </p><p>   ZIMBABWE.  HE IS PERCEIVED TO SUPPORT ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>   OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) AND IS </p><p>   SAID TO BE WORRIED THAT THIS PERCEPTION MAKES HIM </p><p>   VULNERABLE TO TRUMPED-UP CHARGES AND LEGAL CHALLENGES. </p><p>3. THE ARTICLE QUOTES MASIYIWA EXTENSIVELY, AND RECOUNTS </p><p>   HIS 1990 ABDUCTION AND DETENTION BY CIO AGENTS. </p><p>   MASIYIWA SAYS HE WAS TAKEN AT GUNPOINT FROM HIS OFFICE </p><p>   BY TWO CIO AGENTS, ONE OF WHOM, ROBERT MANUNGO, IS </p><p>   ALLEGED TO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ARRANGE THE ASSASSINATION </p><p>   OF "DAILY NEWS" EDITOR GEOFF NYAROTA.  THIS ALLEGATION </p><p>   COMES FROM THE SELF-CONFESSED, WOULD-BE ASSASSIN WHO </p><p>   CLAIMS TO HAVE GOTTEN COLD FEET ABOUT THE KILLING AT THE </p><p>   LAST MOMENT. </p><p>4. THE ARTICLE RELATES MASIYIWA\'S ACCOUNT OF THE ABDUCTION </p><p>   AND DETENTION FOR ONE DAY AT A POLICE STATION IN </p><p>   GOROMONZI, A SMALL TOWN ABOUT 30 MILES FROM HARARE. </p><p>   MASIYIWA IS QUOTED IN THE STORY AS SAYING THAT HIS </p><p>   STRONG RELIGIOUS FAITH BEGAN THE DAY OF HIS ABDUCTION. </p><p>   HE ALSO SAYS THAT A SENIOR ZIMBABWEAN POLICE OFFICIAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04446  091253Z </p><p>   TOLD HIM SEVERAL MONTHS LATER THAT HE WAS LUCKY TO HAVE </p><p>   BEEN RELEASED ALIVE. </p><p>5. MASIYIWA HAS A STRONG REPUTATION FOR HONESTY AND </p><p>   INTEGRITY.  HIS ACCOUNT OF THE ABDUCTION AND DETENTION </p><p>   IS CREDIBLE. THE APPARENT PURPOSE OF THE STORY IN THE </p><p>   "DAILY NEWS" IS TO LEND CREDENCE TO REPORTS THE </p><p>   NEWSPAPER HAS PUBLISHED IN THE PAST WEEK ABOUT THE PLOT </p><p>   TO ASSASSINATE ITS EDITOR AND THE ALLEGED CIO CONNECTION </p><p>   TO THAT PLOT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
