<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ROME 000699 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PGOV, PGOV, PGOV, IT, ITPREL, ITPREL, ITPREL, ITALIAN POLITICS, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY: BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT RIDING TOUGH DOMESTIC </p><p>WAVE ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00699  01 OF 04  202219Z </p><p>REF: A. ROME 0443 </p><p>     B. ROME 6167 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/POLITICAL-MINISTER COUNSELOR GARY ROBBINS </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ITALY HAS MADE ITS STRATEGIC CHOICE ON IRAQ.  THE GOI </p><p>WILL BACK FORCIBLE DISARMAMENT OF SADDAM, WITH OR WITHOUT A </p><p>UN RESOLUTION, IF IT BECOMES NECESSARY.  HOW IT GETS TO THAT </p><p>DECISION POINT WILL BE MESSY, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI IS CONFRONTING A MOSTLY UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL </p><p>SITUATION ON THE HOME FRONT.  THE ITALIAN PUBLIC </p><p>OVERWHELMINGLY OPPOSES MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ; THE </p><p>VATICAN CONTINUES TO PRESS THE "PEACE" TRACK; AND THE </p><p>CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION REFUSES TO CLIMB ON BOARD A BIPARTISAN </p><p>BANDWAGON.  STRIP AWAY ITALY\'S SECULAR FACE, AND A COUNTRY </p><p>THAT IS STILL HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY "CULTURAL CATHOLICISM" </p><p>SURFACES.  IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS, THIS TRANSLATES INTO </p><p>DEEP SKEPTICISM TOWARD MILITARY ACTION, IF NOT OUTRIGHT </p><p>PACIFISM.  IT MAKES THE GOI\'S PUBLIC "BURDEN OF PROOF" FOR </p><p>WHY ITALY MAY NEED TO SUPPORT ARMED INTERVENTION IN IRAQ VERY </p><p>HIGH. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE GOI HAS SETTLED ON A WORKABLE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>STRATEGY THAT RESULTED IN OVERWHELMING COALITION SUPPORT FOR </p><p>ITS FEBRUARY 19 MOTION ON IRAQ (SEPTEL): EMPHASIZE PEACE, </p><p>PREPARE FOR CONFLICT, AND CONSULT REGULARLY WITH PARLIAMENT. </p><p>THE CENTER-LEFT, EAGER TO RIDE THE TIGER OF PUBLIC OPINION, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00699  01 OF 04  202219Z </p><p>HAS SPURNED THE GOI\'S EFFORTS TO TURN IRAQ POLICY INTO A </p><p>BIPARTISAN ISSUE.  FOR THIS REASON, DENYING THE OPPOSITION </p><p>THE OPPORTUNITY TO PAINT THE GOI AS ISOLATED IN EUROPE WAS, </p><p>FOR BERLUSCONI, A KEY OUTCOME OF THE FEBRUARY 17 EU SUMMIT </p><p>AND MAY HELP SOME IN MANAGING PUBLIC OPINION.  IN PUBLIC, THE </p><p>PM WILL CONTINUE TO STRESS THAT ITALY IS WORKING FOR PEACE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING A MAJOR ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION IN </p><p>ROME.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, IT IS MAKING THE CASE MORE </p><p>OPENLY THAT TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR SADDAM TO COOPERATE WITH </p><p>THE UN INSPECTIONS.  IF PRESIDENT BUSH DECIDES TO ATTACK </p><p>IRAQ, THE GOI WILL LINE UP A DIVIDED COUNTRY BEHIND A </p><p>U.S.-LED MILITARY COALITION.  WE BELIEVE THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS SOLID ENOUGH INTERNALLY, AND STILL ENJOYS </p><p>SUFFICIENTLY BROAD PUBLIC SUPPORT TO STAY THE COURSE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A FAITHFUL ALLY </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE GOI HAS ARRIVED AT THE IRAQ ENDGAME FULLY </p><p>COMMITTED TO SOLIDIFYING ITALY\'S POLITICAL AND SECURITY </p><p>PARTNERSHIP WITH THE U.S.  IT HAS MADE A STRATEGIC CHOICE IN </p><p>BACKING OUR FUNDAMENTAL GOAL OF DISARMING SADDAM.  PM </p><p>BERLUSCONI\'S SIGNATURE ON THE WALL STREET JOURNAL "LETTER OF </p><p>THE EIGHT" PROVED A WILLINGNESS TO TAKE SIDES IN PUBLIC, AT </p><p>SOME POLITICAL RISK.  THE GOI\'S RECENT GRANTING OF ROAD, </p><p>RAIL, AND PORT ACCESS FOR MOVEMENT OF U.S. TROOPS AND </p><p>EQUIPMENT THROUGH ITALIAN NATIONAL TERRITORY MOVES ITALY </p><p>FURTHER INTO THE CAMP OF THOSE COUNTRIES OFFERING NOT ONLY </p><p>POLITICAL, BUT ALSO CONCRETE SUPPORT.  ITALY IS AND WILL </p><p>REMAIN A FAITHFUL ALLY -- WILLING TO MAKE THE TOUGH CALLS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00699  01 OF 04  202219Z </p><p>WHEN NECESSARY.  NEVERTHELESS, BERLUSCONI IS MANAGING A </p><p>DELICATE DOMESTIC SITUATION THAT IMPACTS HOW THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAS FRAMED THE IRAQ ISSUE AND THE TACTICS THE GOI HAS ADOPTED </p><p>TO SUPPORT ITS POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>TOUGH DOMESTIC SLEDDING </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ITALY\'S IRAQ POLICY IS BEING GENERATED UNDER MOSTLY </p><p>UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES:  STRONG ANTI-WAR </p><p>SENTIMENT, THE PERSISTENT INFLUENCE NOT SIMPLY OF THE VATICAN </p><p>BUT CATHOLIC POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY MORE BROADLY, AND AN </p><p>OPPOSITION DETERMINED TO SEEK POLITICAL ADVANTAGE AND THUS </p><p>UNWILLING TO BROOK ANY COMPROMISE OVER AN ISSUE IT HAS CAST </p><p>AS PEACE VERSUS WAR.  NEW POLLS RELEASED LAST WEEK REVEAL A </p><p>YAWNING GAP BETWEEN THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF ITALIANS WHO </p><p>BELIEVE BOTH THAT IRAQ HAS TIES TO AL-QAIDA AND RETAINS WMD </p><p>CAPABILITY, BUT YET REJECT THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE OUT OF </p><p>HAND, AND THE MINORITY WILLING TO COUNTENANCE WAR AS A MEANS </p><p>TO ADDRESS THE THREAT.  SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC IS NOW </p><p>OPPOSED TO ATTACKING IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE VATICAN\'S INFLUENCE IS INDIRECT AND DIFFUSE; THE </p><p>POPE IS NOT PULLING ANY STRINGS AT THE PM\'S OFFICE OR THE </p><p> </p><p>SVC REF B NOT 2003 MSG </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2279 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00699  02 OF 04  202220Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOEE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EAP-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NRRC-00  NSAE-00  OES-00   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    SVC-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      SA-00    SSD-00   PMB-00   DRL-01   G-00     SSR-00   SAS-00 </p><p>        /005W </p><p>                  ------------------3901DD  202221Z /15 </p><p>P 201733Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8354 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 ROME 000699 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY: BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT RIDING TOUGH DOMESTIC </p><p>WAVE ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00699  02 OF 04  202220Z </p><p>MFA.  HOWEVER, AS LONG AS THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO CLAIM </p><p>"THERE ARE STILL AVENUES OF PEACE TO EXPLORE," IT IS </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR THE GOI TO ARGUE OTHERWISE.  MOREOVER, ITALY, </p><p>DESPITE A DECADES-LONG TREND OF SECULARIZATION, REMAINS A </p><p>COUNTRY THAT IS "CULTURALLY CATHOLIC" AND ITS POLITICAL </p><p>CLASS--ESPECIALLY ON THE CENTER-RIGHT--REFLECTS THIS SOCIAL </p><p>REALITY.  THE UPSHOT IS A PERVASIVE AND VISCERAL ANXIETY </p><p>ABOUT MILITARY CONFLICT THAT, WITHIN THE GOVERNING COALITION, </p><p>EXTENDS BEYOND THE TINY CENTRIST UNION OF CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS </p><p>(UDC). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) INDEED, A STRONG CATHOLIC STREAK RUNS THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>GOVERNING COALITION; OLD LINE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS PLAY AN </p><p>IMPORTANT ROLE IN FORZA ITALIA AND ARE ACTIVE IN THE </p><p>RIGHT-WING NATIONAL ALLIANCE.  WHILE THESE PROFESSIONAL </p><p>POLITICIANS ARE NOT DETERMINANT IN SHAPING THE FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>DEBATE, THEY WIELD CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE. MOREOVER, A </p><p>GOVERNING COALITION THAT REACHED OUT TO CATHOLIC VOTERS AS A </p><p>KEY CONSTITUENCY CANNOT AFFORD TO USE BELLICOSE RHETORIC TO </p><p>EXPLAIN POLICY CHOICES.  THEREFORE, THE RHETORICAL TONE IS </p><p>MUTED, STRATEGY IS CAST IN TERMS OF MAINTAINING THE FOCUS ON </p><p>PEACE, AND PUBLIC ENCOURAGEMENT IS GIVEN TO DIPLOMATIC </p><p>INITIATIVES REGARDLESS OF THEIR CHANCES OF SUCCESS (REF A). </p><p>WHILE PREPARING FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF CONFLICT, THE GOI IS </p><p>TRYING TO INSULATE ITSELF FROM ACCUSATIONS THAT IT IS </p><p>PRO-WAR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION\'S DISJOINTED APPROACH TO </p><p>IRAQ IS A MIXED BLESSING FOR THE GOI.  THE OPPOSITION\'S </p><p>TACTICAL DECISION TO TARGET GOI POLICY AS PART OF ITS </p><p>LONG-RUNNING GUERRILLA WARFARE CAMPAIGN AGAINST BERLUSCONI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00699  02 OF 04  202220Z </p><p>WILL PREVENT ANY SIGNIFICANT BI-PARTISAN COOPERATION, WHICH </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE POST-COLD WAR ERA HAS BEEN THE NORM ON MAJOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES.  THE GOI HAS MADE AN EFFORT TO </p><p>"NATIONALIZE" ITS IRAQ POLICY, CALLING ON THE CENTER-LEFT TO </p><p>UNITE BEHIND A POLICY OF DIPLOMACY BACKED BY THE THREAT OF </p><p>FORCE.  HOWEVER, WITH PUBLIC SENTIMENT RUNNING SO STRONGLY </p><p>AGAINST CONFLICT, AND THE OPPOSITION DESPERATELY SEARCHING </p><p>FOR ISSUES AROUND WHICH IT CAN RALLY VOTERS, THE CENTER-LEFT </p><p>WILL WORK TO KEEP THE DEBATE DIVISIVELY PARTISAN.  WHILE THIS </p><p>COMPLICATES THE GOI\'S MANAGEMENT OF THE ISSUE IN PARLIAMENT, </p><p>THERE IS AN UPSIDE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  SPLIT AMONG THREE CAMPS--A PACIFIST LEFT, A CENTER-LEFT </p><p>OPPOSED TO PREVENTIVE WAR BUT SENSITIVE TO THE UN, AND AN </p><p>ELITE CONCERNED ABOUT RELATIONS WITH THE U.S AND ITALIAN </p><p>PRESTIGE--THE OPPOSITION IS NOT WELL POSITIONED TO INFLICT </p><p>SERIOUS POLITICAL DAMAGE ON THE GOI.  INDEED, THE CENTER-LEFT </p><p>WOULD SPLINTER BADLY IF A FOLLOW-ON RESOLUTION TO UNSC 1441 </p><p>AUTHORIZING MILITARY FORCE WERE PASSED BY THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL.  MANY IN THE OPPOSITION\'S RANK AND FILE ARE PINNING </p><p>THEIR HOPES ON FRANCE TO FORESTALL THIS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE INSTITUTIONAL ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>REPUBLIC IS NOT STRONG IN ITALY; THE OFFICE HOLDER\'S </p><p>INFLUENCE STEMS FROM HIS MORAL STANDING AND PERSUASIVE </p><p>ABILITIES.  PRESIDENT CIAMPI, WHO ENJOYS BROAD RESPECT, ACTS </p><p>AS A BUFFER BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION AND IS </p><p>FOCUSED INTER ALIA ON ENSURING THAT INSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES </p><p>DO NOT BREAK DOWN.  BUT HE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO SHAPING </p><p>POLITICAL OPINION -- INCLUDING ON THE IRAQ DEBATE -- IF NOT </p><p>SO MUCH POLICY OUTCOMES (SEPTEL). </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00699  02 OF 04  202220Z </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) CIAMPI IS A COMMITTED INTERNATIONALIST WHO BELIEVES </p><p>AS STRONGLY IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRANSATLANTIC </p><p>RELATIONSHIP AS HE DOES THE EUROPEAN UNION.  HE WOULD MAKE </p><p>HIS VIEWS KNOWN (AND HAS DONE SO) WERE THE BERLUSCONI </p><p>GOVERNMENT IGNORING ONE OR THE OTHER IN POLICY FORMULATION. </p><p>NOW, THEIR MUTUALLY COINCIDING GOALS--DEMONSTRATING ITALY\'S </p><p>FAITHFULNESS TO AN ALLY AND KEEPING THE EU\'S INTERNAL CRISIS </p><p>WITHIN MANAGEABLE BOUNDS--WORKS TO THE BENEFIT OF THE GOI. </p><p>INDEED, A LETTER FROM CIAMPI DELIVERED TO BERLUSCONI ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 14 IN WHICH HE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE TO ITALY OF </p><p>THE EU, THE TRANSATLANTIC LINK, AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE UN, ALSO COMPLIMENTED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT FOR ITS HANDLING OF THE IRAQ ISSUE.  IF THE GOI </p><p>CANNOT FIND COVER UNDER BI-PARTISANSHIP, IT HAS FOUND SOME </p><p>COMFORT IN THE INSTITUTIONAL ARMS OF THE PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>MANAGING THE DEBATE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) BERLUSCONI AND HIS CLOSEST POLITICAL </p><p>ALLIES--ESPECIALLY DEPUTY PM FINI, HOUSE OF DEPUTIES </p><p>PRESIDENT CASINI, FM FRATTINI, AND DEFMIN MARTINO--HAVE SO </p><p>FAR MANAGED TO KEEP THE WHITE HOT IRAQ ISSUE ON THE RAILS. </p><p> </p><p>SVC PARA 8 HAS NO PARA MARKING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2489 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00699  03 OF 04  202358Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOEE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EAP-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NRRC-00  NSAE-00  OES-00   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SA-00 </p><p>      SSD-00   PMB-00   DRL-01   G-00     SSR-00   SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------390B91  202358Z /15 </p><p>P 201733Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8355 </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 000699 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY: BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT RIDING TOUGH DOMESTIC </p><p>WAVE ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>WITHIN THE COALITION, DISSENTERS FROM THE PM\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00699  03 OF 04  202358Z </p><p>LINE--INCLUDING A GROUP OF LIBERAL LEGISLATORS PERPLEXED </p><p>ABOUT PREEMPTIVE WAR--HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO SPEAK OUT WITHOUT </p><p>BEING SHOUTED DOWN.  BERLUSCONI HAS ALSO MET PERSONALLY WITH </p><p>LEGISLATORS NOT COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE WITH THE GOI\'S </p><p>POSITION.  SHUTTING OFF INTERNAL DEBATE WOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE; BY FRAMING ITALY\'S IRAQ POLICY AROUND A VIRTUOUS </p><p>GOAL--COMING TO THE AIDE OF AN ALLY IN NEED--BERLUSCONI HAS </p><p>EFFECTIVELY DEFUSED THE RISK OF A FIFTH COLUMN DEVELOPING. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) FINI, FOR HIS PART, HAS PLAYED A BEHIND-THE-SCENES </p><p>ROLE, HELPING TO CONTAIN ANTI-WAR SENTIMENT IN THE NATIONAL </p><p>ALLIANCE.  CASINI HAS BEEN MORE OUTSPOKEN.  WHILE HIS PARTY, </p><p>THE UDC, IS THE SMALLEST COALITION PARTNER, ON IRAQ ITS </p><p>SKEPTICISM TOWARD WAR IS BROADLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT\'S CATHOLIC ELECTORATE.  CASINI IS ACUTELY </p><p>SENSITIVE TO THESE FORMER CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC VOTERS--AND </p><p>THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN PARLIAMENT--AND HAS ADROITLY MIXED A </p><p>PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO PEACE WITH POLITICAL REALISM IN </p><p>FRAMING THE ISSUE PUBLICLY.  FRATTINI\'S STRAIGHTFORWARD </p><p>NON-POLEMICAL APPROACH IN DEFENSE OF THE UN\'S CRITICAL BUT </p><p>NOT EXCLUSIVE ROLE IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT HAS HELPED KEEP THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT LINE CONSISTENT AND RELATIVELY CLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) MARTINO\'S JOB IS TO HELP MANAGE THE POLITICAL </p><p>PROCESS IN THE LEGISLATURE.  BY AND LARGE, HE HAS WIDESPREAD </p><p>CREDIBILITY BECAUSE HE IS CONSIDERED HONEST, SERIOUS, AND </p><p>GENERALLY REFUSES TO BE DRAGGED IN TO THE DAILY "TEATRINO" OF </p><p>POLITICAL SHADOW DANCING.  THE GOI\'S DECISION TO CONSULT WITH </p><p>PARLIAMENT ON DETAILED FLOW OF FORCES ISSUES CERTAINLY WAS </p><p>TAKEN WITH AN EYE TO CONTAINING OPPOSITION RANCOR, BUT IT HAS </p><p>ALSO PROBABLY HELPED KEEP THE COALITION IN LINE.   INDEED, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00699  03 OF 04  202358Z </p><p>MARTINO, WHO WE ARE TEMPTED TO CALL A RELUCTANT HAWK, MUST, </p><p>IN DEALING WITH PARLIAMENT, MANAGE A FLOCK OF DOVES WHO ARE </p><p>CULTURALLY ALLERGIC TO SEEING ITALY ENGAGED DIRECTLY IN </p><p>MILITARY CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) THE DEFMIN, WHO SOWED HIS POLITICAL OATS IN THE NOW </p><p>DEFUNCT ITALIAN LIBERAL PARTY, OWES HIS ALLEGIANCE TO </p><p>BERLUSCONI, NOT TO ANY PARTICULAR POLITICAL GROUPING.  HE </p><p>SERVES AS A LIGHTENING ROD FOR THE PM, AND MARTINO\'S CAUTION </p><p>REFLECTS, WE THINK, MOSTLY A RECOGNITION THAT THE GOI IS FAR </p><p>OUT IN FRONT OF PUBLIC OPINION.  MARTINO HAS AT TIMES SAID </p><p>MORE IN PUBLIC THAN WE THOUGHT NECESSARY.  HOWEVER, AS </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED IN REF B, IN GETTING OUT IN FRONT ON </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL SECURITY ISSUES SUCH AS IRAQ, HE MORE OFTEN </p><p>THAN NOT SETS THE TERMS OF DEBATE, AND USUALLY IS ABLE TO </p><p>STEER IT IN A DIRECTION FAVORABLE TO OUR INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) DENYING THE CENTER-LEFT AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE EUROPE </p><p>AS A WEDGE ISSUE ALSO HAS BEEN FUNDAMENTAL TO THE GOI\'S </p><p>OVERALL STRATEGY.  WITH 56 PERCENT OF ITALIANS SAYING THEY </p><p>JUDGE POSITIVELY THE ROLE OF FRANCE AND GERMANY ON IRAQ </p><p>VERSUS 41 PERCENT SAYING THE SAME ABOUT THEIR OWN COUNTRY\'S </p><p>ROLE, EFFORTS TO BRIDGE THE INTRA-EU GAP HAVE A DUAL FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY (PAVING THE WAY FOR A SUCCESSFUL ITALIAN EU </p><p>PRESIDENCY) AND DOMESTIC POLITICAL OBJECTIVE.  EVEN A PAPER </p><p>EXERCISE SUCH AS THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED EU SUMMIT SHOULD HELP </p><p>BERLUSCONI AMELIORATE HIS "EUROPE" PROBLEM AND REDOUND </p><p>POSITIVELY WITH PUBLIC OPINION. AT THE SAME TIME, BERLUSCONI </p><p>MUST BE ATTUNED TO LATENT AND NOT-SO-LATENT ANTI-AMERICANISM </p><p>CREEPING AROUND THE EDGES OF ANTI-WAR SENTIMENT IN ITALY. THE </p><p>MORE EU COVER HE CAN SECURE FOR HIS VERY PRO-US POLICY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00699  03 OF 04  202358Z </p><p>POSITIONS, THE BETTER THE GOI WILL BE ABLE TO COUNTER THIS </p><p>PHENOMENON.  COMPLETING A "TRIFECTA" BY HELPING TO MEND THE </p><p>RIFT BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE U.S., WITHIN THE EU, AND BETWEEN </p><p>THE GOI AND THE ITALIAN PUBLIC, IS ONE OF BERLUSCONI\'S KEY </p><p>POLICY OBJECTIVES. </p><p> </p><p>HOLDING IT TOGETHER </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) THE ONE MILLION (UNOFFICIAL ESTIMATES) PEACE </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS WHO MARCHED IN ROME ON FEBRUARY 15 WILL NOT </p><p>CHANGE THE GOI\'S DECISION-MAKING PARADIGM.  BERLUSCONI HAS </p><p>SAID PUBLICLY THAT HE BELIEVES THEY UNDERMINED THE CAUSE OF </p><p>PEACE BY GIVING SADDAM FALSE HOPE THAT FULL COOPERATION WITH </p><p>THE UN INSPECTORS MAY NOT BE NECESSARY.  HE KNOWS THAT, WHILE </p><p>CERTAINLY SOME CENTER-RIGHT VOTERS PARTICIPATED, GENERALLY </p><p>ITALY\'S CONSERVATIVE CLASSES DO NOT TAKE TO THE STREETS. </p><p>WHILE LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE SCHEDULED IN MAY, VOTERS DO NOT </p><p>HAVE A HISTORY OF USING THEM AS REFERENDA TO REGISTER </p><p>DISSATISFACTION WITH GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE ON NATIONAL </p><p>ISSUES.  THE GOI IS HOPING THAT BY THE TIME ELECTIONS TO THE </p><p>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ROLL AROUND NEXT YEAR, IT CAN TOUT THAT </p><p>ITALY ON IRAQ WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2490 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00699  04 OF 04  202359Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOEE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EAP-00   VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NRRC-00  NSAE-00  OES-00   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SA-00 </p><p>      SSD-00   PMB-00   DRL-01   G-00     SSR-00   SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------390BA4  202359Z /15 </p><p>P 201733Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8356 </p><p>INFO NTO EU COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORECE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL PRIORITY </p><p>SEDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 04 ROME 000699 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY: BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT RIDING TOUGH DOMESTIC </p><p>WAVE ON IRAQ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00699  04 OF 04  202359Z </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C)  NEVERTHELESS, THE DEMONSTRATIONS DID HIGHLIGHT THE </p><p>VERY SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC RELATIONS DILEMMA THE GOI MUST STILL </p><p>TRY TO RESOLVE.  ON THE ONE HAND, BERLUSCONI, IN HIS PRESS </p><p>STATEMENTS, WILL CONTINUE TO STRESS THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>PURSUING ALL OPTIONS TOWARD A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE </p><p>CRISIS.  FOR EXAMPLE, FOLLOWING HIS FEBRUARY 18 MEETING WITH </p><p>KOFI ANNAN, HE SAID, "NO ONE IS THINKING ABOUT GIVING UP </p><p>EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT A PEACEFUL SOLUTION."  YET, IN MORE </p><p>FORMAL SETTINGS, SUCH AS HIS FEBRUARY 19 STATEMENT BEFORE </p><p>PARLIAMENT, THE PM IS ADOPTING A MORE COLDLY RATIONAL </p><p>APPROACH.  ITALY, HE SAID, IS WORKING FOR PEACE BUT IRAQ MUST </p><p>BE DISARMED; SADDAM ALONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS FATE; AND </p><p>NON-COOPERATION WILL LEAD TO SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.  WE MUST </p><p>SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF PEACE, BUT NOT OF SURRENDER, BERLUSCONI </p><p>AFFIRMED. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) WE THINK IT UNLIKELY THAT THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT </p><p>WILL BE ABLE TO SHIFT PUBLIC OPINION DRAMATICALLY ON IRAQ. </p><p>IN LEADING FROM THE FRONT, THE GOI HAS PLACED THE U.S.-ITALY </p><p>RELATIONSHIP AND ITS PERCEPTION OF ITALY\'S NATIONAL INTEREST </p><p>AT THE FORE -- WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF A SECURE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>AND ELECTORAL BASE, WHICH, IT PROBABLY CALCULATES (WE THINK </p><p>CORRECTLY) WILL CAST FUTURE VOTES ON THE BASIS OF MORE </p><p>PAROCHIAL ISSUES.  UNTIL THE UN INSPECTORS REPORT AGAIN ON </p><p>MARCH 1, ITALY WILL CONTINUE TO CONDUCT A RHETORICAL </p><p>BALANCING ACT, BUT RECOGNIZES THAT THE WAITING GAME MAY BE </p><p>NEARLY OVER.  OUR ACE IN THE HOLE IS THAT BERLUSCONI WILL </p><p>FOLLOW OUR LEAD ON HOW LONG IS LONG ENOUGH.
