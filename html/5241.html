THE FOLLOWING REPORT IS INTENDED AS AN OVERVIEW OF </p><p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN ITALYS COMMUNICATIONS SECTOR TO </p><p>HELP WASHINGTON AGENCIES PREPARE FOR MARCH 6-7, 2003 </p><p>BILATERAL MEETINGS IN ROME. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY. ITALY HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST </p><p>DEVELOPED COMMUNICATIONS MOBILE AND FIXED LINE MARKETS </p><p>IN THE WORLD. THE GOVERNMENT HAS LIBERALIZED THE </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS MARKET, HAS IMPLEMENTED EU-RELATED </p><p>DIRECTIVES AND IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AMONG THE MORE </p><p>OPEN WITHIN THE EU IN COMMUNICATIONS POLICY.  RECENTLY, </p><p>HOWEVER, GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN THE MARKET HAS BEEN </p><p>INCREASING. ON THE REGULATORY SIDE, THE COMPLEX LAYERS </p><p>OF LEGISLATION (EU, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL) ARE CAUSING </p><p>PROBLEMS FOR COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ITALY HAS AWARDED 3G (UMTS) LICENSES, BUT COMMERCIAL </p><p>APPLICATIONS OF 3G OPERATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED SOON. </p><p>INTERNET USE IS GROWING, BUT COMMERCIAL USE, BOTH B2B </p><p>AND B2C, IS NOT AT THE LEVEL OF OTHER EUROPEAN </p><p>ECONOMIES. ITALY HAS AN AMBITIOUS STRATEGY TO BRING </p><p>BROADBAND TO ALL PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT BY THE END OF </p><p>2005. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>A LIBERALIZED MARKET, BUT STILL WITH PROBLEMS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  OVER THE LAST DECADE, ITALY HAS LIBERALIZED ITS </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTED RELATED EU </p><p>DIRECTIVES IN A PRO-MARKET MANNER. OUR SECTOR CONTACTS </p><p>MAINTAIN THAT AFTER THE UK, ITALY HAS THE MOST OPEN </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS MARKET IN THE EU. SOME NOTABLE SIGNS OF </p><p>PROGRESS: TARIFFS ARE MORE ALIGNED WITH COSTS, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR REGARDING LEASED LINES; INTERCONNECTION </p><p>CHARGES REMAIN BELOW EU AVERAGE; THERE IS AN ESTABLISHED </p><p>REGULATORY REGIME REGARDING LOCAL LOOP UNBUNDLING; </p><p>CARRIER PRE-SELECTION IS POPULAR AND WIDESPREAD; AND </p><p>NUMBER PORTABILITY, ALTHOUGH DELAYED FROM THE MAY 2002 </p><p>TARGET, IS SOON TO OCCUR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DESPITE THESE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS, PROBLEMS </p><p>CLEARLY REMAIN. MOBILE TERMINATION RATES, FIXED TO </p><p>MOBILE IN PARTICULAR, REMAIN AMONG THE HIGHEST IN EUROPE </p><p>WITH LITTLE TRANSPARENCY REGARDING COST STRUCTURE FOR </p><p>CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION, SOME NEW MARKET ENTRANTS ARE </p><p>CONCERNED WITH TELECOM ITALIAS (THE FORMER INCUMBENT) </p><p>DELAYS AND LACK OF TRANSPARENCY WITH PROCEDURES IN </p><p>ALLOWING INTERCONNECTION AND LOCAL LOOP ACCESS.  RIGHTS </p><p>OF WAY REMAIN A BOTTLENECK TO DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE, ALTHOUGH PROBLEMS SEEM TO BE PRIMARILY </p><p>AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>AND NEW COMPLEXITIES EMERGE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p></p><p>6. ONE EMERGING ISSUE CONCERNS THE GROWING LEGAL </p><p>COMPLEXITY OF THE ITALIAN MARKET. WITH A 2001 LAW, THE </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS DEVOLVED SEVERAL POWERS TO </p><p>ITALYS 20 ADMINISTRATIVE REGIONS. COMPANIES NOW HAVE TO </p><p>TAKE INTO ACCOUNT REGIONAL LAWS IN ADDITION TO EU </p><p>DIRECTIVES AND NATIONAL LEGISLATION. WHILE REGIONS DO </p><p>NOT HAVE AUTHORITY IN THE FIELD OF COMMUNICATIONS, THEY </p><p>DO LEGISLATE ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, WHICH OFTEN HAVE </p><p>AN IMPACT ON COMMUNICATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT. ONE EXAMPLE PROVIDED BY A U.S. COMPANY IS </p><p>THAT OF THE NEWLY IMPOSED REGIONAL LIMITS ON ELECTRONIC </p><p>MAGNETIC TRANSMISSION.  MOST REGIONS ARE ADOPTING </p><p>STANDARDS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE EU </p><p>CEILING.  MOREOVER, EACH REGION IMPOSES DIFFERENT </p><p>LIMITATIONS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR COMPANIES TO </p><p>DEVELOP COUNTRY-WIDE STRATEGIES. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOI BACK IN THE DRIVERS SEAT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.
