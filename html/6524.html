<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000519 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, YM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: ISLAH PARTY MODERATE WARNS ABOUT DEMONSTRATIONS; </p><p>DISCUSSES ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 263 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol/Econ Deputy Chief Catherine J. Westley for Reasons 1 </p><p>.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  Islah party political director Mohamed </p><p>Qahtan expressed concern that an onset of war in Iraq would </p><p>endanger Americans in Sanaa because increased demonstrations </p><p>may spiral out of the government\'s control.  P/E DepChief met </p><p>with him on March 17 at his request.  Qahtan, a well-known </p><p>moderate, requested the meeting to discuss his concerns </p><p>about demonstrations and whether the April 27 parliamentary </p><p>elections will be postponed.  Party election preparations and </p><p>the case of Sheikh Mohammed Ali al-Moayed were also discussed </p><p>(septel).  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Concern about Demonstrations </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Qahtan expressed concern that the </p><p>government-sponsored demonstrations could spiral out of </p><p>control with the onset of war in Iraq.  He wanted to warn the </p><p>Embassy to be extra careful as he did not have great </p><p>confidence that all demonstrations would be controlled well </p><p>by the security forces.  Qahtan also said he thinks "Saddam </p><p>should go now" and that the "Iraqi people have suffered </p><p>enough." </p><p> </p><p>3,  (C)  P/E DepChief brought up the Islah party leadership\'s </p><p>comments at the government-sponsored demonstration held on </p><p>March 15.  Islah party leader Sheikh al-Ahmar and Islah party </p><p>Shura Council Chairman and leader of the fundamentalist </p><p>faction Sheikh al-Zindani were both quoted in press reports </p><p>as calling for jihad against Americans should a war begin </p><p>against Iraq.  P/E DepChief said that comments like that put </p><p>Americans and the Embassy in danger and were crossing the </p><p>line.  Qahtan said he had written a column negating those </p><p>comments that was not published.  He offered to apologize on </p><p>behalf of the party, but said he cannot really speak for all </p><p>factions.  (Comment:  Zindani leads the fundamentalist </p><p>faction, Qahtan is one of the moderates.  End Comment).  He </p><p>said that President Saleh had co-opted al-Zindani starting </p><p>with his forced participation on the Code of Conduct </p><p>committee (ref), and tried to place part of the blame for </p><p>al-Zindani\'s comments on the government for allowing and </p><p>perhaps encouraging them.  He did not address Sheikh </p><p>al-Ahmar\'s comments. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Post learned from the United Nations Security Chief </p><p>in Sanaa that the March 15 demonstration had to be dispersed </p><p>by gunfire in the air by security forces after some unruly </p><p>youths tried to climb a police truck with a machine gun </p><p>mounted upon it.  This information was not confirmed by the </p><p>RSO with the Ministry of Interior.  The MOI said the </p><p>dispersal by gunfire was to stop stone throwers from getting </p><p>out of hand.  No one was injured or killed. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Elections Could be Postponed;  Party Preparations </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Qahtan said that he hears rumors constantly about a </p><p>possible postponement of the April 27 elections if an Iraq </p><p>war starts, but does not have any concrete information.  He </p><p>indicated that he hoped there would not be any delay.  P/E </p><p>DepChief said that we encourage the elections to go forward. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Qahtan said election preparations are continuing </p><p>between the Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) and within Islah. </p><p>Approximately 65 constituencies are already agreed between </p><p>Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) and Islah in terms of which </p><p>party\'s candidate runs in which constituency.  These are </p><p>primarily in Aden, Taiz and Sanaa.  As of March 16, 8 </p><p>constituencies of the regions already discussed remain </p><p>unresolved.  Discussions are ongoing, and Qahtan </p><p>characterizes them as constructive.  He did not give an exact </p><p>number of seats where YSP women are running for the JMP, but </p><p>said there were several. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Post will continue to monitor demonstrations closely </p><p>and disseminate information on their scope and location to </p><p>the American community to ensure their safety.  It is </p><p>doubtful that the comments made by certain Islah party </p><p>members regarding jihad or containing other inflammatory </p><p>language will end.  The Islah party in particular will try to </p><p>use the Iraq war and U.S.-Yemeni counterterrorism cooperation </p><p>to discredit the governing General People\'s Congress (GPC) in </p><p>the election campaign.  End Comment </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
