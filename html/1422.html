<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008362 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/20/2010 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, SOCI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: FOOD SUPPLIES ADEQUATE BUT EXPENSIVE AT YEAR END </p><p> </p><p>REF: 99 KINSHASA 8063 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Officer Katherine Simonds.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Food supplies in Kinshasa\'s markets are </p><p>adequate as we approach the end of the year, and last year\'s </p><p>experience of short supplies and price gouging will not be </p><p>repeated.  Most basic foods are imported because of low </p><p>yields and transportation difficulties for local crops. </p><p>Importers and local producers report that the real problem </p><p>this year is not availability but affordability, because </p><p>consumers have extremely low purchasing power.  This growing </p><p>impoverishment is also eroding the profitability of local </p><p>businesses.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Last Year\'s Fears </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Last year at this time the diplomatic community was </p><p>concerned about social unrest associated with food shortages </p><p>(Reftel).  The GDRC shared the concern and made a limited </p><p>amount of official rate hard currency available to importers </p><p>to supply Kinshasa with low cost food.  Predictably, the </p><p>inadequacy of supplies of price-controlled staples generated </p><p>large profits for middlemen and no benefits for consumers. </p><p>Nonetheless, the Congolese public demonstrated its legendary </p><p>stoicism and unrest did not materialize. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Local Production Hobbled </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The supply of locally-produced food is as poor (or </p><p>poorer) this year as last year.  As recently as the 1980\'s, </p><p>manioc provided half the calories in a typical Zairois diet. </p><p>Manioc yields have fallen as much as 70 percent because </p><p>failure to renew gene stock has allowed diseases to thrive. </p><p>At the same time, the cost of transporting manioc from the </p><p>fields to Kinshasa has skyrocketed (in areas where war has </p><p>not completely cut communication) because of the </p><p>deterioration of roads, the cost and spotty availability of </p><p>fuel and the "tolls" demanded by security forces at </p><p>checkpoints on roads and rivers.  A sack of manioc from Bas </p><p>Congo cost 90 francs in December 1998.  Its price rose 800 </p><p>percent to 790 francs in December 1999 and has risen 900 </p><p>percent in the last year to 8000 francs.  (All estimates show </p><p>that inflation has remained below 500 percent a year for the </p><p>last two years.)  The price of locally produced corn has also </p><p>increased faster than inflation: 800 percent in 1999 and 500 </p><p>percent this year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Imports Available But Expensive </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Despite promises to supply low cost food for the </p><p>holidays, the government has not intervened in the markets </p><p>this year, and consequently imported food is available but </p><p>expensive in local markets.  Bread and rice are replacing </p><p>manioc and corn in local diets, but calorie intake is </p><p>declining.  A baguette of bread costs 20 francs, while the </p><p>salary of an average civil servant is about 1000 francs. </p><p>Bread is hardly affordable, but still easier to buy than corn </p><p>or manioc. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Consumer Woes </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Most residents of Kinshasa struggle throughout the </p><p>day to scrape up money to put a meal on the family\'s table. </p><p>They buy their sugar by the teaspoon, instead of by the bag. </p><p>Horse mackerel, called mpiodi in the DRC, is an important </p><p>source of protein in the Congolese diet, and the market for </p><p>mpiodi demonstrates the effect of declining purchasing power. </p><p> Mpiodi comes in three sizes: 16, 20 and 25 centimeters.  The </p><p>25 centimeter mpiodi provides relatively more flesh (and less </p><p>bone) than the smaller fish.  It used to be preferred in </p><p>Kinshasa, despite a price premium.  Today, however, 16 </p><p>centimeter mpiodi dominates the market.  This is not because </p><p>it is cheaper per pound.  The buyer of a 10 kilo box of </p><p>mpiodi resells the fish individually.  There are almost twice </p><p>as many fish in a box of 16 centimeter mpiodi as in a box of </p><p>25 centimeter fish.  Even if the boxes cost the same, the </p><p>unit price is lower for the smaller fish.  (Of course, the </p><p>protein and calorie content is much lower too.)  The smaller </p><p>fish better fits the daily budget of the average Kinshasa </p><p>consumer. </p><p>------------- </p><p>Business Woes </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Revenues of local businesses have fallen along with </p><p>the public\'s purchasing power.  During the Ambassador\'s </p><p>December 13 Business Roundtable meeting, representatives of a </p><p>package delivery firm, a local supermarket, a bank and a sack </p><p>manufacturer complained about low volumes.  The largest local </p><p>importer of frozen food quantified his company\'s pain for </p><p>Econoff: receipts down 40 percent over the last two years.  A </p><p>second factor which is hurting local food importers and other </p><p>businesses linked to the food sector is the emergence of a </p><p>formidable new competitor called Congo Futur, which has </p><p>become the largest importer of food for the Kinshasa market </p><p>in just two years (Septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
