<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 000747 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, MOPS, IZ, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA WON\'T JOIN MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ </p><p>WITHOUT ANOTHER UNSC RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary:  Echoing Prime Minister Chretian\'s March </p><p>17 comments in Parliament, Canadian Deputy Foreign Minister </p><p>Lavertu formally notified A/DCM Gerson that, absent another </p><p>UNSC resolution, Canada would not participate in a U.S.-led </p><p>military coalition against Iraq. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  A/DCM Leslie Gerson and British High Commissioner </p><p>Sir Robert Andrew Burns were advised by Deputy Foreign </p><p>Minister Gaetan Lavertu in a meeting at Canadian Department </p><p>of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) on March </p><p>17 that the Canadian government will not join in military </p><p>operations against Iraq in the absence of a new U.N. Security </p><p>Council resolution.  During the meeting Mr. Lavertu made the </p><p>following points: </p><p> </p><p>-- Canada has been clear in stating its deep concern </p><p>regarding Iraq\'s weapons of mass destruction program and its </p><p>continued defiance of calls by the international community </p><p>for it to disarm; it has no illusions about the nature of the </p><p>repressive and brutal regime of Saddam Hussein; </p><p> </p><p>-- It therefore strongly supported the unanimous adoption by </p><p>the UNSC of resolution 1441 with its clear message regarding </p><p>\'serious consequences\' if Iraq failed to disarm; Canada </p><p>recognizes the considerable efforts made by Security Council </p><p>members during these past months - led by the U.S. - to find </p><p>a common way forward in terms of ensuring Iraqi compliance </p><p>with its international obligations; </p><p> </p><p>-- The GOC knows that this has not been easy and has taken </p><p>considerable political time and effort to try to manage this </p><p>issue through the United Nations; it is grateful that this </p><p>effort was made, believing that United Nations Security </p><p>Council is the appropriate forum within which to determine </p><p>this important matter of international peace and security. </p><p> </p><p>--Canada has said that, if there were a clear decision by the </p><p>UN Security Council, it would do its part; it deeply regrets </p><p>the inability of Security Council members to come to </p><p>agreement on the issue of a second resolution, despite the </p><p>efforts made.  Canada did its best to try and bridge the deep </p><p>divisions within the Council and understands why we have </p><p>decided that we now need to act on the serious consequences </p><p>spelled out in 1441; </p><p> </p><p>-- While Canada intends to leave its 1280 military personnel, </p><p>ships and aircraft in the region to continue to contribute to </p><p>the campaign against terrorism, as the Prime Minister stated </p><p>today in the House of Commons, it will not be a member of the </p><p>military coalition against Iraq; </p><p> </p><p>-- In its public messaging the GOC will stress that the issue </p><p>is, and continues to be, about Iraq; its non-compliance; its </p><p>weapons of mass destruction and its grudging cooperation with </p><p>the inspectors, even in the face of Security Council </p><p>unanimity and the build up of military forces in the region. </p><p>Iraq bears the responsibility for the consequences of its </p><p>actions and continued violation of international law.  Canada </p><p>will also say that it has decided not be a member of the </p><p>military coalition and will concentrate its efforts in the </p><p>campaign against terrorism - through its ships in the Gulf </p><p>and its forthcoming contribution to ISAF in Afghanistan; </p><p> </p><p>-- Canada\'s commitment to the coalition effort under </p><p>Operation Enduring Freedom is undiminished and the horror of </p><p>September 11th is still fresh in its minds; </p><p> </p><p>-- Canada is also preparing to play a major role in the </p><p>continued stability and security of Afghanistan, through </p><p>ISAF; this summer it will deploy a Battle Group to </p><p>Afghanistan for a twelve-month period; Canada believes that </p><p>these tasks are more important than ever; </p><p> </p><p>-- Canada will also do its part in humanitarian assistance </p><p>and post conflict resolution in Iraq, but believes that these </p><p>activities must take place under the auspices of the United </p><p>Nations. In this respect the GOC would urge Council members </p><p>to work assiduously to come to agreement within the Council </p><p>on this important aspect of the Iraq crisis; in this way all </p><p>members of the international community will be able to make </p><p>their contribution to improving the lives of the </p><p>long-suffering Iraqi people. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) We note that Prime Minister Chretien first announced </p><p>his government\'s position earlier in the day during the </p><p>regular question period in the House of Commons. To loud </p><p>applause from the Liberal Party majority, Chretien said </p><p>Canada would not participate in military action against Iraq </p><p>unless a new Security Council resolution authorized such </p><p>action. He claimed no country has worked harder than Canada </p><p>to bridge the gap between factions in the Security Council. </p><p>The Prime Minister also repeated statements he had made in a </p><p>March 9 appearance on an American news program, that there </p><p>was no need to go to war because Saddam is now surrounded and </p><p>monitored by UN weapons inspectors. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Prime Minister Chretien also indicated that Canadian </p><p>naval vessels carrying out escort and surveillance duties in </p><p>the Arabian Sea as part of the war against terrorism will </p><p>continue on those assignments.  Rejecting suggestions that </p><p>the vessels might be reassigned to take part in a war with </p><p>Iraq, Chretien referred to the present mission of the vessels </p><p>as an important one for the Canadian navy. He also said that </p><p>a very small group of Canadian military personnel who are </p><p>assigned through exchange programs to British and American </p><p>units in the region are not in combat roles, and will not be </p><p>removed. </p><p>4. (C) Comment:  The Prime Minister\'s statement today </p><p>regarding the need for a second Security Council resolution </p><p>was a departure from Canada\'s previous waffling on whether a </p><p>second resolution would be necessary for Canadian </p><p>participation in military actions against Iraq.  In </p><p>justifying his government\'s decision  not to join in military </p><p>action against Iraq, Chretien pointed to the failure of the </p><p>latest British proposal to gain any traction in the Security </p><p>Council in recent days as "very important". During his </p><p>meeting with the A/DCM, however, the Deputy Foreign Minister </p><p>stressed that, even though they remain unable to endorse </p><p>military action on the basis of resolution 1441 alone, Canada </p><p>remains a strong friend and ally of both the United States </p><p>and the U.K.  Canada, in its public statements, will voice </p><p>its understanding of any action we undertake and will </p><p>continue to place the blame on Iraq.  We will not, he said, </p><p>hear criticism or doubts expressed by Ottawa. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment Continued: Following the meeting, Political </p><p>Director Jim Wright emphasized that, despite public </p><p>statements that the Canadian assets in the Straits of Hormuz </p><p>will remain in the region exclusively to support Enduring </p><p>Freedom, they will also be available to provide escort </p><p>services in the Straits and will otherwise be discreetly </p><p>useful to the military effort. The two ships in the Straits </p><p>now are being augmented by two more enroute, and there are </p><p>patrol and supply aircraft in the  UAE which are also </p><p>prepared to "be useful."  This message tracks with others we </p><p>have heard.  While for domestic political reasons and out of </p><p>a deep-seated Canadian commitment to multilateralism the GOC </p><p>has  decided not to join in a U.S. coalition of the willing, </p><p>they will refrain from criticism of our actions, express </p><p>understanding, and focus their public comments on the real </p><p>culprit, Iraq. They are also prepared to be as helpful as </p><p>possible in the military margins, an aspect of their role </p><p>which we intend to clarify. </p><p>Kelly </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
