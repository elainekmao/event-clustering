Iranian Foerign Minister Kharrazi, in </p><p>Ankara for meetings on Northern Iraq and the Kurdish issue, </p><p>said that tripartite consultation on Iraq between Turkey, </p><p>Iran and Syria should be reactivated.  Kharrazi stressed at </p><p>a joint press conference with FM Gul on Sunday that Iran is </p><p>against a separate state in northern or southern Iraq.  He </p><p>also voiced objection to any third country intervention in </p><p>Northern Iraq, and warned that Iran would follow suit if </p><p>Turkey sends troops to the region.  A high-level Iranian </p><p>delegation is expected in Ankara in the coming weeks. </p><p>Ankara declared three Iraqi diplomats persona non grata for </p><p>activities beyond their diplomatic authority.  Iraqi Embassy </p><p>First and Second Secretaries Mohamad Hikmat Ibrahim and </p><p>Sabah Al-Duri, and deputy Commercial Counselor Ahmad Matloub </p><p>were notified to leave Turkey by April 9.  Dailies agree </p><p>that the Iraqis are being expelled in line with the demand </p><p>of Secretary Powell, who was in Ankara last week. </p><p>Mainstream papers over the weekend see the allies\' taking </p><p>over the Baghdad airport as a strategic victory for </p><p>coalition forces, and a psychological defeat for the Iraqi </p><p>army.  Monday\'s "Sabah" reports that Shiite residents of </p><p>Kerbela took down a five-meter bronze statue of Saddam after </p><p>U.S. and UK troops took control of the city.  The Shiites </p><p>gave water and food to U.S. troops.  Saturday\'s papers </p><p>report a circular by the Turkish police, warning that Al- </p><p>Qaida has been preparing since November 2002 for attacks </p><p>against U.S. and Israeli targets in Turkey through an </p><p>Iranian-origin terror organization.   Meanwhile, 50,000 </p><p>demonstrators from NGOs, unions, pro-Kurdish, and leftist </p><p>parties rallied against the war in Istanbul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Germany, Turkey agreement on `Milli Gorus\': "Hurriyet" </p><p>expects a heated debate in the parliament on the German- </p><p>Turkish agreement which labeled the Islamist `Milli Gorus\' </p><p>(National View) organization as a terror network.  The </p><p>agreement was sent by the MFA to the parliament for </p><p>approval.  The justification signed by Foreign Minister Gul </p><p>says that `Milli Gorus\' should be outlawed.  `Milli Gorus\' </p><p>is a German-based, financially powerful Islamist </p><p>organization which is strongly affiliated to Necmettin </p><p>Erbakan and his Virtue Party (SP), and has been under tight </p><p>scrutiny for years by the German police for alleged ties to </p><p>international terror organizations and illicit fundraising </p><p>activities in Germany.  AKP deputies coming from the `Milli </p><p>Gorus\' movement voiced strong criticism of the agreement and </p><p>said labeling the group a `terrorist\' organization is </p><p>unacceptable.  Pro-Islamic papers see the attempt as </p><p>`treason,\' and believe the agreement will not be approved by </p><p>the parliament. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Post war scenarios / Turkey-Iran </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Questions about Iraq\'s future" </p><p>Intellectual-social democrat Cumhuriyet carried this front- </p><p>page editorial opinion (4/7): "What is going to happen after </p><p>the war?  It remains to be seen if the US, as an occupying </p><p>force, will be able to establish a stable order not only in </p><p>Iraq, but also in the region.  Otherwise, a wave of terror </p><p>throughout the region is a high probability. .  It is no </p><p>longer a secret that the US intention is actually not </p><p>limited to Iraq, and many commentators are speculating about </p><p>Iran, Syria, and some other Islamic countries on the list. </p><p>This scenario recognizes the presence of a colossal American </p><p>empire in the region, and Turkey better think clearly about </p><p>its stance and policies, without excluding any possible </p><p>development." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Iranian FM visit is a dangerous development" </p><p>Ufuk Guldemir opined in sensational Haberturk (4/7): "From </p><p>the very beginning of the Iraq issue, Ankara has mishandled </p><p>the crisis.  Yet recent developments also bring the question </p><p>to one\'s mind if this mishandling is deliberate, and whether </p><p>the government\'s real purpose is to change Turkey\'s western </p><p>orientation and direct Turkey\'s face toward the Middle East. </p><p>. The sudden visit by the Iranian Foreign Minister to Ankara </p><p>is an alarming negative development.  Giving the appearance </p><p>of an alliance with Iran clearly puts Turkey in the anti- </p><p>western league.  The praise from the Iranian FM about </p><p>Turkish foreign policy is also something that should worry </p><p>us.  What is the purpose of Ankara policy-makers?  Are they </p><p>going to form an anti-western alliance with Syria and Iran? </p><p>Let\'s not forget that both of them are on the US target </p><p>list. . The current policy being pursued by Ankara alienates </p><p>Turkey from western ideals and orientation." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
