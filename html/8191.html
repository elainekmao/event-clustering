<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 SANAA 001150 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, YE, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN\'S NEW GOVERNMENT: NEW BLOOD, MODEST REFORM, </p><p>EMPHASIS ON TECHNOLOGY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM ALAN MISENHEIMER FOR REASON 1.5 (D) , </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C): Begin Summary: ROYG Prime Minister Ba Jammal\'s new </p><p>Cabinet (complete list para 12) introduces several fresh </p><p>faces, but incumbents retain the major ministries and all </p><p>Ministers are members of the General People\'s Congress (GPC). </p><p>At a glance: </p><p>-  By relative population, the South (10 Ministers) outweighs </p><p>the North (25 Ministers) and scores important portfolios for </p><p>junior technocrats. </p><p>-  The average age drops, ten Ministers are Members of </p><p>Parliament, purely tribal/family influence has waned and </p><p>education levels are high. </p><p>-  Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Ahmed </p><p>Sofan wins the added title of Deputy Prime Minister. </p><p>-  The sole female Minister takes her female predecessor\'s </p><p>portfolio, but is moved up to full Minister. </p><p>-  Some former Ministers with poor records are  dismissed; </p><p>others with marginal reputations remain. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The new Cabinet is ready for business and tasked with </p><p>reform.  It should perform adequately. However, by limiting </p><p>Ministers to GPC party stalwarts, and selecting only one </p><p>woman for the Cabinet, Prime Minister Ba Jammal seems to have </p><p>aimed for business as usual over bold change. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Fifty Percent Turnover </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>3. (U) On May 17, ROYG President Ali Abdullah Salih approved </p><p>the new Cabinet presented by incumbent Prime Minister Abdul </p><p>Qadir Ba Jammal.   The list includes 15 new ministers (and </p><p>two former ministers with new portfolios) in a total Cabinet </p><p>of 35, a near fifty percent replacement rate.  However, the </p><p>most important Ministries are unchanged: Alawi Saleh </p><p>Al-Salami as Deputy Prime Minister/Finance Minister, Abubakir </p><p>Abdullah al-Qirbi in Foreign Affairs, Abdullah Alaywah in </p><p>Defense, Rashad al-Alimi in Interior and Ahmed Mohammed Sofan </p><p>as Minister of Planning and International Cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Minister of Planning Promoted </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) The most important change from the Embassy\'s </p><p>perspective may be Ahmed Sofan\'s promotion to Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister, retaining his portfolio as Minister of Planning and </p><p>International Cooperation (no longer "Planning and </p><p>Development".)  Some observers believe the Prime Minister </p><p>needs him as a counterweight to the powerful Finance </p><p>Minister, Alawi Saleh al-Salami, who reigned as sole Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister in the previous cabinet.  Comment: While </p><p>al-Salami gets good marks from the World Bank and others for </p><p>his strict monetary policy, he has been less effective in </p><p>advancing business and development.  In contrast, Sofan, a </p><p>successful businessman by background, has made his planning </p><p>and development portfolio a center for long-term investments </p><p>in Yemen\'s social and human resources. End Comment </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>The South Keeps Its Edge </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>5. (U) The North/South tally of cabinet seats (25/10) is </p><p>still tipped toward Aden by relative population </p><p>(approximately 16 million to four million.)  In addition, </p><p>several new Cabinet Ministers have portfolios that reflect </p><p>the long-standing Southern edge in education and </p><p>international business.  The new Ministers of Justice, </p><p>Transportation, Fisheries, Industry, Higher Education and </p><p>Technical Education have impressive credentials as Southern </p><p>technocrats. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>DEMOGRAPHICS </p><p>------------ </p><p>6. (U) The average age of the Cabinet has declined, with two </p><p>young Ministers and no elder statesmen.  For example, the new </p><p>Ministers of both Justice and Agriculture are thirty-four, </p><p>but most Ministers weigh in with solid forties and fifties. </p><p>In a sign of growing technocracy, 12 Ministers have PhD\'s and </p><p>seven have MA\'s.  Only four Ministers come from wealthy </p><p>commercial families and only three have important tribal </p><p>standing.  The single woman member is a notable Cabinet </p><p>standout.  Former Ambassador to the Netherlands Amat al-Alim </p><p>al-Soswah takes the designated female portfolio of Human </p><p>Rights, but as a concession to her public stature, she was </p><p>elevated to full Minister, rather than Minister of State. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>New Stars For The Party? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>7. (U) Ten Ministers are Members of Parliament, including </p><p>seven impressive first-time winners in the recent elections. </p><p>Sanaa\'s mayor, Ahmed al-Kohlani, Minister of State without </p><p>Portfolio, may be the most outstanding, given his effective </p><p>administrative record.  His tribal connections, while </p><p>important, may be less of a factor than his high popularity </p><p>in the capital city. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The new Ministers of Agriculture, Justice, Transport </p><p>and Civil Service also shine as freshman Parliamentarians. </p><p>They all showed electoral prowess, and now have the fortune </p><p>to replace marginally effective former Ministers.  The GPC </p><p>will mark these new party stars for bright futures if they </p><p>can manage their first portfolios more successfully than </p><p>their predecessors. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Yemen is changing, and even such establishment </p><p>institutions as the Cabinet are beginning to reflect more </p><p>important priorities than tribal and regional preferences. </p><p>For example, the distinction between North and South may </p><p>gradually be losing its importance as groups begin to align </p><p>by common interests and issues:  political parties; business; </p><p>religion; reform. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Ba Jammal could and should have nominated a number of </p><p>well-qualified female Ministers.  However, his sole choice is </p><p>a good one.  She may help pave the way for more </p><p>representative government in the future.  The Cabinet\'s </p><p>educated young technocrats have impressive credentials and </p><p>should be able to conduct public business with more </p><p>credibility than their predecessors. By ridding himself of </p><p>deadwood (like the former Education Minister) Ba Jammal </p><p>should accomplish more in his second term. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The GPC\'s landslide victory in the recent elections, </p><p>although hampered by losses in Sanaa and tarnished by </p><p>controversy over vote-counting in some districts, gives the </p><p>government a solid mandate for its programs.   The GPC must </p><p>now show the public that it heard the electorate\'s clear </p><p>calls for government reform.  Ba Jammal seems to have split </p><p>the difference - continuity in the power ministries but </p><p>significant change elsewhere.
