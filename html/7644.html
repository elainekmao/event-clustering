<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0119 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          APRIL 23, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1. This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 23, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Milliyet:  Ankara is undertaking a major </p><p>legal arrangement to bring PKK militants down </p><p>from the mountains because it is not being </p><p>satisfied with the results of the "repent law" </p><p>for dissolving the PKK.  The expanded legal </p><p>arrangements, which aim to contribute to social </p><p>reconciliation, have been made in light of the </p><p>evaluations at the summit of the state to </p><p>eradicate the terrorist components and their </p><p>arms. The projects has also been evaluated at the </p><p>National Security Council, and it is assessed </p><p>that such an arrangement will become more </p><p>effective to enhance the national security </p><p>because of the likely political atmosphere and </p><p>structure taking place in postwar Iraq.  Ending </p><p>the chaotic situation and filling the vacuum of </p><p>authority in the region will also encourage the </p><p>PKK/KADEK militants to benefit from the new </p><p>repent law. Officials said that previous repent </p><p>laws were unfruitful, and the desired results </p><p>were not attained from them despite distribution </p><p>of thousands of handouts by helicopters to the </p><p>militants in the mountains.  The current repent </p><p>law would give short-term light sentences </p><p>followed by pardoning the militants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Hurriyet:  Turkey sought an amicable solution </p><p>to four arson and mysterious killing cases </p><p>handled at the European Court of Human Rights </p><p>yesterday.
