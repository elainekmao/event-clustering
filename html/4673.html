<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 001580 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV - PLEASE PASS TO USAID/ANE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/11/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, BM, TH, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSK TALKS BIG PICTURE WITH NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRACY\'S AMBRAMOWITZ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  Following meetings with several SPDC </p><p>officials, former Ambassador Morton Ambramowitz met at the </p><p>EMR with NLD Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi on December 5th.  The </p><p>COM and the PAO were also present.  In a discussion that </p><p>lasted nearly two hours, Ambramowitz checked his impressions </p><p>and the assertions of the SPDC officials with ASSK.  He asked </p><p>for ASSK\'s reading of the gravity of the situation facing the </p><p>country and the prospects for change, and her views on how </p><p>best to provide humanitarian assistance.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  The former ambassador, now a Director of the National </p><p>Endowment for Democracy, had met earlier with the Home, </p><p>Labor, and Education Ministers, as well as with Kyaw Thein </p><p>and Hla Min.  A meeting with S1 General Khin Nyunt was </p><p>cancelled at the last minute.  Ambramowitz reported that a </p><p>theme he had not heard in his last visit in 1997, the </p><p>"integration of the ethnic nationalities," permeated all his </p><p>discussions with SPDC officials.  Most officials averred that </p><p>there was no economic crisis, and the SPDC was moving at its </p><p>own pace toward transition, because the integration of the </p><p>nationalities was not secure enough to move precipitously to </p><p>a new arrangement. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  ASSK replied that in her recent visit to Shan State </p><p>she found "strong solidarity between the ethnicities and us" </p><p>and greater support than the NLD enjoyed twelve years ago. </p><p>She said she was encouraged that the Shans had evidently laid </p><p>aside ethnic considerations and had recognized that the most </p><p>important need was for political change.  Even in the go-go </p><p>border town of Tachileik, she found "amazing support," </p><p>signifying that the merchants dependent on the border trade </p><p>had realized that there could be no economic development </p><p>without political change.  She indicated that she would </p><p>complete a round of visits to each of the States during this </p><p>dry season. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Ambramowitz asked whether a "humanitarian crisis" </p><p>exists and, if so, should more assistance be given, even if </p><p>through the Burmese Government?  ASSK agreed there were very </p><p>serious problems, such as HIV/AIDS, the quality of education, </p><p>and the health care system.  While she said she didn\'t </p><p>believe the system was on the verge of collapse, something </p><p>very small could spark "unforeseen circumstances."  She said </p><p>that assistance programs should be expanded, but not through </p><p>the SPDC.  Although she allowed there have to be dealings </p><p>with the government, there should be "no compromise" on the </p><p>basic requirements for accountability, transparency, </p><p>independent monitoring, and providing no benefit to the SPDC. </p><p> She offered the Network Project (a UNICEF early childhood </p><p>development program) as an example of a program that worked </p><p>without helping the SPDC and promoted pluralism at the same </p><p>time.  She expressed dismay that USG assistance for this </p><p>project may not be continued. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  She complained that the SPDC was able to "pressurize" </p><p>the UN agencies against cooperating with her, and asked, if </p><p>UN agencies cave in to pressure on this front "how can we </p><p>trust them" on other matters.  She pointed out it must be </p><p>questioned whether humanitarian assistance would help the </p><p>Burmese people provide for themselves in the future.  "Are </p><p>they going to survive just to die another day?  Or are they </p><p>going to survive to change the system?" </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Ambramowitz said he was leaving Burma with the </p><p>impression that the current regime would make very little </p><p>effort to deal with her or to move toward civilian </p><p>government, and asked whether the only way to effect change </p><p>under these circumstances would be to encourage a split in </p><p>the military.  ASSK agreed he was "basically right" and that </p><p>it was probably Sr. General Than Shwe who opposed change. </p><p>She opined that he could not be as firmly in control as is </p><p>supposed because he is "too lazy to do his homework" and lets </p><p>people around him do all the work.  She said the </p><p>international community must keep up the pressure, continue </p><p>to point out that change is inevitable and at the same time, </p><p>make clear to those in the military that favor political </p><p>change that reasonable elements are appreciated, and give </p><p>them more confidence. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  As the discussion wound down, ASSK said it was </p><p>necessary to continue to "work on practical terms" and "build </p><p>up the strength of the people -- but that\'s our (e.g. the </p><p>party\'s) job and . . . we\'re not doing badly."  She said </p><p>although she cannot say the NLD as an organization is getting </p><p>stronger -- citing the stumbling blocks to opening branch </p><p>offices including harassment by local PDC\'s and USDA\'s -- </p><p>support for the party is getting much stronger. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
