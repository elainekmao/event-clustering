<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001081 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PARM, PREL, PTER, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MANPADS NEA BILATERAL PLANS: POST INPUT FOR JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 36950 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) This message responds to reftel request for input on </p><p>the MANPADS situation in Jordan. Answers are keyed to </p><p>questions posed in reftel paras 7-13. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>General Information </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Jordan possesses a limited stock of MANPADS, all of </p><p>which are under the physical control of the Jordanian Armed </p><p>Forces (JAF).  The JAF has/had old U.S.-made Redeye MANPADS </p><p>but it is likely these systems, which were phased out of the </p><p>active U.S inventory more than 20 years ago and are well past </p><p>their shelf life, are no longer functional.  The JAF does not </p><p>have any open FMS Repair and Return cases on the Redeye, </p><p>which most likely means they are no longer maintaining the </p><p>system.  The JAF does, however, have operational </p><p>Russian-origin SA-8 and SA-13 MANPADS in an Air Defense </p><p>battalion.  To confirm numbers and serviceability  status of </p><p>the Redeyes and SA-8/13s would require bilateral coordination </p><p>with the JAF. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S)  Thus far, no MANPADS have been seized in Jordan </p><p>during interdiction operations, although the Kingdom has been </p><p>a very active weapons smuggling location for terrorist groups </p><p>including Hizbullah, Hamas, PIJ, IRGC and al-Qaeda.  That </p><p>said, the quantity and sophistication of other weapons that </p><p>have been confiscated raise the possibility that </p><p>terrorist-linked groups in Jordan could seek to obtain </p><p>MANPADS now or in the future. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Government Cooperation </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) The U.S. maintains an extremely close and productive </p><p>working relationship with the GOJ on a wide range of </p><p>military, security, anti-terrorism, political and economic </p><p>issues.  As part of this overall relationship, and within the </p><p>constraints of Jordan\'s limited resources, we can expect the </p><p>GOJ to respond very cooperatively to a U.S. effort to </p><p>strengthen MANPADS anti-proliferation measures. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Jordan, with USG assistance, continues to strengthen </p><p>its border security operations.  USG has worked closely with </p><p>the General Intelligence Directorate (GID) in the deployment </p><p>of detection and screening equipment in border areas. </p><p>Similarly, FMF funding for the JAF has devoted considerable </p><p>resources to enhancing the Kingdom\'s ability to patrol and </p><p>stop infiltration along its long borders.  The JAF recognizes </p><p>that the groups that would use MANPADS for terrorist attacks </p><p>pose a threat to the GOJ and foreign targets alike and thus </p><p>the JAF, GID, and PSD are partners in preventing MANPADS from </p><p>falling into the wrong hands.  As an example, Sky Marshals </p><p>for the national airline -- Royal Jordanian (RJ) -- are drawn </p><p>from the ranks of serving JAF officers and many JAF generals </p><p>are alumni of this program. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Having noted Jordan\'s overall commitment to counter </p><p>MANPADS and other threats, it is important to recognize that </p><p>the GOJ\'s tools have certain limitations.  For instance, the </p><p>JAF\'s standards for security and storage areas for these </p><p>weapons may not be equal to those of the U.S.  The JAF would </p><p>likely welcome any U.S.-funded upgrade to JAF MANPAD storage </p><p>facilities.  In an similar vein, the Kingdom\'s export control </p><p>laws and legal enforcement mechanisms could benefit greatly </p><p>from USG training and assistance.  The planned NP-sponsored </p><p>Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance (EXBS) </p><p>program would address some of these shortcomings in designing </p><p>and implementing a national export control system.  The GOJ\'s </p><p>receptivity for such training is indicative of a broader </p><p>recognition that it needs to shore up legal and other </p><p>deficiencies in its control of goods exported from or in </p><p>transit through Jordan. </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Feasible Arguments </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) The GOJ is acutely aware of, and is actively </p><p>combating, threats posed by terrorist groups seeking to use </p><p>MANPADS, WMD and/or other weapons to wreak economic havoc on </p><p>the local or international economy.  The GOJ\'s success in </p><p>uncovering the Millennium Plot in which al-Qaeda cells </p><p>planned to execute mass casualty terrorist attacks on hotels </p><p>and other tourist sites in the Kingdom is testament to the </p><p>seriousness with which it views such possibilities.  The </p><p>national air carrier -- Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ) -- is </p><p>owned by the state.  A successful MANPADs attack on one of </p><p>its planes would have deeply negative consequences not only </p><p>for RJ but for Jordan\'s overall business climate.  The GOJ, </p><p>as it seeks to build Jordan\'s tourism sector and reform its </p><p>economy, would be responsive to efforts aimed at lessening </p><p>MANPADS threats. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Financial Incentives </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Any GOJ concern about participating in a coordinated </p><p>MANPADS anti-proliferation strategy would stem not from a </p><p>philosophical disagreement but rather from a lack of </p><p>resources.  Earmarking USG funds for the destruction, </p><p>purchase, or enhanced storage of MANPADS in JAF stocks would </p><p>be a useful incentive in this regard. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Government Contacts and Engagement Opportunities </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The JAF, the General Intelligence Directorate (GID) </p><p>and the Public Security Directorate (PSD) are the GOJ </p><p>agencies that would be most usefully engaged in a bilateral </p><p>MANPADS strategy.  When NP\'s EXBS program begins later in </p><p>2003, we believe it would offer a useful forum to engage </p><p>these government bodies and other relevant GOJ players on </p><p>MANPADS.  Similarly, future visits by senior Washington </p><p>policymakers to Jordan on CT and military/security issues </p><p>should highlight the importance of countering MANPADS threats </p><p>as part of their overall bilateral presentations. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
