POLOFF MET NOVEMBER 28 WITH MFA ASEAN DEPARTMENT </p><p>SEANWFZ EXPERT TRAN DUC BINH TO DISCUSS REFTEL QUESTIONS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02580  280819Z </p><p>BINH SHARED THE FOLLOWING VIEWS, KEYED TO REFTEL POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>2.   SOVEREIGNTY:  BINH STATED DEFINITELY THAT ASEAN\'S </p><p>REJECTION OF THE PROPOSED P-4 CLARIFICATIONS WAS NOT BASED </p><p>ON OVERT OBJECTIONS FROM CHINA.  ASEAN DOES NOT HAVE CHINA\'S </p><p>VIEWS ON THIS POINT; IT IS THE ASEAN VIEW, HOWEVER, THAT </p><p>ARTICLE 3 SHOULD STAND AS AGREED BETWEEN ASEAN AND CHINA FOR </p><p>CHINA\'S SAKE. (NOTE:  THE LINE BETWEEN ACTIVE CHINESE </p><p>OPPOSITION AND ASEAN ANTICIPATION OF CHINESE OPPOSITION IS A </p><p>VERY FINELY DRAWN ONE.  ASEAN\'S APPARENT SENSITIVITIES TO </p><p>CHINESE VIEWS MAY OBVIATE THE NEED FOR FORMAL STATEMENTS. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>3.   BINH EXPLAINED THAT ASEAN\'S PROPOSED ARTICLE 3 WAS </p><p>FORMULATED TO ADDRESS CHINA\'S SPECIFIC CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY OVER CONTINENTAL SHELVES AND EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC </p><p>ZONES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.  ASEAN AND CHINA ARRIVED AT </p><p>THEIR AGREED TEXT BASED ON NEW PROPOSALS FROM CHINA, AND THE </p><p>MARCH P-4 DEMARCHE ARRIVED AFTER AGREEMENT HAD ALREADY BEEN </p><p>REACHED BASED ON THE NEW LANGUAGE.  ESSENTIALLY, ASEAN </p><p>VIEWED THE P-4 PROPOSAL AS A RETREAT TO OLDER GROUND. </p><p>POLOFF EMPHASIZED THAT OUR CONCERN ON THIS PORTION OF THE </p><p>TEXT IS SIMPLY CLARITY OF LANGUAGE, A POINT BINH TOOK ON </p><p>BOARD. </p><p> </p><p>3.   ZONE OF APPLICATION:  BINH BELIEVED ASEAN\'S BASIC </p><p>STANCE ON THIS ISSUE IS THAT THE PROPOSED ADDITION WOULD </p><p>UNDERMINE THE STRENGTH OF THE SOVEREIGNTY ARTICLE AS AGREED </p><p>BETWEEN ASEAN AND CHINA.  HE ALSO REPEATED ASEAN\'S VIEW THAT </p><p>ELIMINATION OF THE SECOND SENTENCE ON NEGATIVE SECURITY </p><p>ASSURANCE SHOULD MEET P-4 CONCERNS OVER ZONE OF APPLICATION. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02580  280819Z </p><p>POLOFF ASKED FOR THE STATUS OF ASEAN DELIBERATIONS OVER </p><p>DELETION OF THE SECOND SENTENCE, AND BINH SAID HE BELIEVED </p><p>ASEAN IS "CONSIDERING POSITIVELY" DELETION OF THE SENTENCE - </p><p>- AS PART OF A LARGER PACKAGE WHICH INCLUDES RETENTION OF </p><p>THE BEIJING-APPROVED SOVEREIGNTY ARTICLE AND NO NEW LANGUAGE </p><p>ON ZONE OF APPLICATION (ESSENTIALLY A RESTATEMENT OF THE NON- </p><p>PAPER POSITION).  BINH DID NOTE THAT ASEAN MAY BE WILLING TO </p><p>CONSIDER SOME ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE FOR THE SOVEREIGNTY </p><p>ARTICLE TO ADDRESS CLARITY CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>4.   TRANSIT RIGHTS:  BINH SAID THAT ASEAN HAS SEVERAL </p><p>ALTERNATIVES ON THE TABLE NOW.  MEMBER STATES ARE CONSULTING </p><p>ON THE ALTERNATIVES IN THEIR CAPITALS, TO BE FOLLOWED BY </p><p>FURTHER CONSULATION BY ASEAN AS A WHOLE.  WHEN THE RESULTS </p><p>ARE IN, ASEAN WILL FORWARD THEM FOR P-4 CONSIDERATION.  BINH </p><p>EXPECTED THIS TO BE WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE PROPOSED MARCH </p><p>GROUP CONSULTATIONS, POSSIBLY EARLY FEBRUARY.  HE DECLINED </p><p>TO GIVE ANY VIEWS AT THIS POINT ON WHAT ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE </p><p>MIGHT BE. </p><p> </p><p>5.   RULES OF PROCEDURE:  BINH UNDERTOOK TO CONSULT WITH HIS </p><p>OFFICE BUT EXPECTED NO DIFFICULTY IN PASSING A COPY OF THE </p><p>RULES TO US. </p><p> </p><p>6.   POLOFF LEFT A COPY OF REFTEL QUESTIONS WITH BINH, AND </p><p>HE PROMISED TO FORWARD ANY ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK HIS </p><p>DEPARTMENT MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE.  HE UNDERTOOK TO GET </p><p>MORE DETAILS SPECIFICALLY ON THE ISSUE OF ZONE OF </p><p>APPLICATION, ON WHICH TOPIC HE WAS DISSATISFIED WITH HIS OWN </p><p>EXPLANATIONS.  EMBASSY WILL ALSO FORWARD A COPY OF THE RULES </p><p>OF PROCEDURE WHEN OBTAINED. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02580  280819Z </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
