<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 002315 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/RPM, EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, GR, IT, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN MOD ON NATO COMMAND STRUCTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ATHENS 1723 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5(B), (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  ITALIAN DEFENSE MINISTER ANTONIO MARTINO IS ADAMANT </p><p>THAT ANY NATO COMMAND STRUCTURING PLANS SHOULD MAKE SENSE </p><p>BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND OPERATIONALLY, ACCORDING TO FRANCESCO </p><p>TRUPIANO, MARTINO\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR.  DURING A MAY 23 </p><p>DISCUSSION ON OTHER MATTERS, TRUPIANO TOLD POL-MIL COUNSELOR </p><p>THAT MARTINO HAD AGREED TO THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE AIRSOUTH FROM </p><p>ITALY TO TURKEY BECAUSE OF HIGH-LEVEL USG REQUESTS TO HIM </p><p>PERSONALLY, EVEN THOUGH HE COULD NOT SEE THE OPERATIONAL OR </p><p>ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE MOVE.  IT WAS A "PAINFUL" CONCESSION, </p><p>TRUPIANO SAID, THAT RAN COUNTER TO ITALY\'S NATIONAL INTERESTS </p><p>AND MARTINO\'S CONSERVATIVE (U. OF CHICAGO) ECONOMICS </p><p>TRAINING.  MARTINO WOULD NOT BE AS SUPPORTIVE OF OTHER </p><p>COMMAND STRUCTURING PROPOSALS THAT MADE LITTLE MILITARY, </p><p>ECONOMIC OR OPERATIONAL SENSE, TRUPIANO SAID. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  FOR THAT REASON, MARTINO OPPOSES THE IDEA OF </p><p>RELOCATING ITALY\'S ONLY COMBINED AIR COMMAND CENTER (CAOC) TO </p><p>SPAIN, TRUPIANO SAID.  AS CURRENTLY CONFIGURED, THE CAOC </p><p>GIVES HUNGARY AND ITALY STRATEGIC COVERAGE OF THE BALKANS </p><p>FROM TWO ANGLES.  THIS ADVANTAGE WOULD BE LOST BY A MOVE WEST </p><p>TO SPAIN, TRUPIANO EXPLAINED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ITALY ALSO SEES NO BENEFIT FROM A CAOC IN GREECE, </p><p>WHICH WOULD IN EFFECT GIVE GREECE OPERATIONAL CONTROL OVER </p><p>TURKISH AIRSPACE.  THIS WOULD NOT BE OFFSET BY MOVING </p><p>    AIRSOUTH TO TURKEY BECAUSE AIRSOUTH CONSISTS OF A COMMAND </p><p>STRUCTURE WITH LITTLE OPERATIONAL EFFECT, ACCORDING TO </p><p>TRUPIANO.  GREECE WOULD STILL HAVE CONTROL OVER TURKISH </p><p>AIRSPACE, WHICH MIGHT WELL PROMPT TURKEY TO INSIST ON HAVING </p><p>A CAOC OF ITS OWN. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT.  WHILE HE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY RAISE GREECE\'S </p><p>PROPOSAL (REFTEL) TO MOVE NAVSOUTH FROM NAPLES TO GREECE (AND </p><p>NEITHER DID WE), TRUPIANO DID REMARK THAT, AFTER ITALY\'S </p><p>COOPERATION ON THE AIRSOUTH MOVE, THE GOI WOULD STRONGLY </p><p>OPPOSE ANY OTHER PROPOSALS THAT WOULD FURTHER DIMINISH NATO\'S </p><p>PRESENCE IN ITALY.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02315 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
