THEY SAID THAT THIS MOVE DID </p><p>NOT REPRESENT A DIMUNITION OF THEIR INTEREST IN CYPRUS, BUT </p><p>RATHER MARKED THE END OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEPLOYMENT PERIOD </p><p>FOR THE AD HOC MARINE TASK FORCE NOW INCORPORATED INTO THE </p><p>UK\'S UNFICYP FORCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UK DRAFT ON OIL-FOR-FOOD OK, BUT STILL HAS PROBLEMS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C)  THE DUTCH PLAN TO WORK OFF THE UK DRAFT OIL-FOR-FOOD </p><p>RESOLUTION, PER.

HE WARNED THAT, UNLESS FURTHER </p><p>REFINED TO ANSWER "THE HUMANITARIAN SYMPATHIES CHAMPIONED IN </p><p>THE FRENCH DRAFT AND POPULAR WITH EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTS AND </p><p>PUBLICS," THE POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR AN OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM </p><p>THAT STILLS RETAINS PROPER SAFEGUARDS ON DUAL-USE ITEMS WILL </p><p>FURTHER SUFFER. </p><p>FENDRICK </p><p></p></div>
