(C) ZAGREB 288 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY NICHOLAS HILL, POL/ECON COUNSELOR, </p><p>FOR REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CROATIAN PRESIDENT MESIC AND OTHERS IN THE GOC HAVE </p><p>BEEN LARGELY SUPPORTIVE SINCE SECRETARY POWELL\'S PRESENTATION </p><p>TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON FEBRUARY 5.  THE AMBASSADOR SAW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00292  01 OF 02  061736Z </p><p>TOMISLAV JAKIC, MESIC\'S FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR, AND MARIO </p><p>NOBILO, ASSISTANT FOREIGN MINISTER FOR MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS, </p><p>ON FEBRUARY 6, TO DISCUSS IRAQ AND DELIVER A TRANSCRIPT OF </p><p>THE SECRETARY\'S SECURITY COUNCIL PRESENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) JAKIC SAID THAT MESIC PLANNED TO DELIVER A TOUGHLY </p><p>WORDED STATEMENT (ADVANCE COPY PARA 5) TO THE NATION AT 7 PM </p><p>ON FEBRUARY 6 CONVEYING CROATIA\'S POSITION ON IRAQ.  CROATIA </p><p>WANTS TO SEE THE U.S. USE THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND TO PURSUE </p><p>MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY IN ITS EFFORTS TO DISARM IRAQ, BUT AT </p><p>THE END THE DAY, IRAQ MUST BE DISARMED.  ACCORDING TO JAKIC, </p><p>PRESIDENT MESIC WAS NOT INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE GOC\'S </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE VILNIUS 10 STATEMENT (REFTEL B) ISSUED AFTER </p><p>THE SECRETARY\'S UNSC PRESENTATION AND WANTED TO DO HIS PART </p><p>IN READYING THE CROATIAN PEOPLE FOR THE DIFFICULT PERIOD </p><p>AHEAD.  THE AMBASSADOR COMMENDED THE PRESIDENT\'S INITIATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, THE AMBASSADOR HEARD A </p><p>SIMILAR MESSAGE FROM ASSISTANT MINISTER NOBILO.  THE U.S. CAN </p><p>COUNT ON CROATIA\'S SUPPORT, BUT HOPES THAT THE U.S. WILL MAKE </p><p>EVERY EFFORT TO EXPLAIN ITS POLICIES CLEARLY, TAKING INTO </p><p>ACCOUNT ARAB AUDIENCES, AND WORKING TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE </p><p>THROUGH THE SECURITY COUNCIL.  HE NOTED THAT CROATIA HAD BEEN </p><p>PUT IN AN "UNPLEASANT" SITUATION.  THERE WAS A SPLIT IN THE </p><p>EU ON THE ISSUE AND THE GOC WAS BEING "PUSHED FROM VARIOUS </p><p>SIDES" ON HOW TO REACT.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT THE U.S. </p><p>WAS DOING EVERYTHING IT COULD TO WORK THE ISSUE IN THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL.  THE U.S. IS EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL REMAIN RELEVANT; PART OF THE COUNCIL\'S </p><p>REMAINING RELEVANT, HE ADDED, INVOLVES ENFORCING EXISTING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00292  01 OF 02  061736Z </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS ON IRAQ.  THIS IS IN THE </p><p>INTEREST OF THE U.S. AND THE UNITED NATIONS AS AN </p><p>INSTITUTION.  OTHERWISE THE UN BECOMES THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) THE FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED TWO STATEMENTS ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 5 ON THE SITUATION IN IRAQ.  THE FIRST EXPRESSED </p><p>CROATIA\'S "PARTNERSHIP AND SOLIDARITY" WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>EFFORT TO DISARM IRAQ.  THE MFA UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR IRAQ </p><p>TO HONOR "UNCONDITIONALLY" UN RESOLUTION 1441, WHICH CALLS </p><p>FOR COMPLETE COOPERATION WITH THE UN INSPECTORS ON THE </p><p>GROUND.  THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION </p><p>POSES "THE MOST SERIOUS THREAT" TO SAFETY AND SECURITY IN THE </p><p>WORLD TODAY.  THE MFA\'S SECOND STATEMENT WAS IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>THE EU PRESIDENCY\'S FEBRUARY 4 APPEAL TO IRAQ.  ECHOING THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY, THE MFA STATEMENT NOTED THAT THE DEADLINE WHICH </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD SET IN UNSC RESOLUTION 1441 </p><p>HAD PASSED AND THAT IRAQ MUST "IMMEDIATELY AND </p><p>UNCONDITIONALLY" COMPLY WITH ALL UN RESOLUTIONS.  ALL UN </p><p>MEMBER STATES MUST RESPECT UN DECISIONS "FOR THE SAKE OF </p><p>PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE WORLD."  (TRANSLATIONS EMAILED TO </p><p>EUR/SCE NARDI.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) ADVANCE COPY OF PRESIDENT MESIC STATEMENT TO THE </p><p>NATION ON FEBRUARY 6 (INFORMAL EMBASSY TRANSLATION).  BEGIN </p><p>TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC </p><p> </p><p>      AT THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL SESSION, THE U.S. SECRETARY </p><p>OF STATE PRESENTED A LARGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF THE IRAQI CRISIS, AND THE POSSIBLE LINKS BETWEEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00292  01 OF 02  061736Z </p><p>IRAQ AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  PART OF THIS INFORMATION </p><p>CAN QUALIFY IN THE EVIDENCE CATEGORY, WHILE THE SECOND PART </p><p>CONSISTS OF STRONG INDICATIONS.  BOTH LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION </p><p>THAT DOUBTS ABOUT THE LACK OF THE BAGHDAD REGIME,S FULL </p><p>COOPERATION WITH UN INSPECTORS ARE WELL-FOUNDED, AND THAT </p><p>THIS VIOLATES SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1441 DATED NOVEMBER </p><p>OF LAST YEAR, WHICH REQUESTS DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ IN THE </p><p>CONTEXT OF POSSESSION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>      AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, I HAVE ON </p><p>MORE THAN ONE OCCASION EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>CREATION AND OPERATION OF THE GLOBAL ANTI-TERRORIST </p><p>COALITION.  I HAVE ALSO STRESSED THAT FACTORIES FOR THE </p><p>PRODUCTION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, AS WELL AS THE </p><p>WEAPONS THEMSELVES, MUST BE PUT UNDER EFFICIENT INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONTROL, THAT IS, THAT THEY MUST BE DESTROYED IF SUCH CONTROL </p><p>CANNOT BE IMPLEMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>      THIS CONTINUES TO BE MY STANDPOINT.  I AM CERTAIN THAT </p><p>ALONG WITH IT I AM PROTECTING THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA,S AND </p><p>ALL OF ITS CITIZENS, KEY INTERESTS, BECAUSE BOTH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WHICH </p><p>ARE NOT UNDER CONTROL, REPRESENT A POTENTIAL BUT VERY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1849 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00292  02 OF 02  061736Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01 </p><p>      VCE-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   DHS-00   SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /005W </p><p>                  ------------------3217DC  061736Z /38 </p><p>O 061715Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9408 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000292 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, UNSC, IZ, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA SUPPORTIVE AFTER POWELL PRESENTATION </p><p> </p><p>REALISTIC DANGER FOR ALL, INCLUDING OUR COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>      I ALSO REPEAT THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH CONCRETE </p><p>OPERATIONS DIRECTED AT FIGHTING GLOBAL TERRORISM, IT IS </p><p>NECESSARY TO UNDERTAKE A LONG-TERM FIGHT AGAINST ITS ROOTS. </p><p>I ALSO DEEM IT NECESSARY TO ONCE AGAIN POINT OUT THE </p><p>COMPELLING PLACE AND ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS, BOTH IN THE </p><p>FIGHT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, AS WELL AS IN EFFORTS </p><p>TO FIND, PUT UNDER CONTROL, OR, IF IT PROVES TO BE THE ONLY </p><p>SOLUTION, DESTROY WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00292  02 OF 02  061736Z </p><p>      THE BAGHDAD AUTHORITIES BEAR THE CRUCIAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY.  THEY HAVE TO PROVE IRREFUTABLY THAT THEY ARE </p><p>FULLY COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED NATIONS INSPECTORS, IN </p><p>OTHER WORDS, THEY MUST, IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER AND WITHOUT </p><p>DELAY, PROVIDE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE INFORMATION </p><p>PRESENTED BY THE UNITED STATES TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL. </p><p>DENIAL IS NOT AN ANSWER THAT CAN SATISFY THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY.
