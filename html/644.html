<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 KADUNA 00284 </p><p> </p><p>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR MCKINLEY; PARIS FOR PERLOW </p><p>LAGOS PASS TO ABUJA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: LAST GASP FROM KADUNA: POLITICS IN NORTHERN </p><p>NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>1.  THIS IS THE SECOND OF FOUR END-OF-TOUR, END-OF-POST </p><p>CABLES FROM KADUNA, GIVING AN OVERVIEW OF NORTHERN </p><p>NIGERIA.  THE OTHER THREE WILL DEAL RESPECTIVELY WITH </p><p>THE COMMERCIAL AND ECONOMIC CLIMATE, THE CULTURAL </p><p>SCENE, AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES AND CONDITIONS.  THEY ARE </p><p>MEANT FOR ORIENTATION OF OFFICERS ARRIVING IN THE </p><p>SUMMER OF 1994 TO TAKE UP REPORTING POSTS IN ABUJA, AS </p><p>WELL AS TO FULFILL POST REPORTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: POLITICAL TRADITIONS IN NORTHERN NIGERIA, </p><p>AS ESEWHERE, STRETCH BACK TO THE PRE-INDEPENDENCE </p><p>PERIOD.  UNLIKE OTHER SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE LARGER-THAN-LIFE FIGURE OF THE FIRST PREMIER OF </p><p>NORTHERN NIGERIA, THE SARDAUNA OF SOKOTO, CONTINUES TO </p><p>HANG OVER POLITICAL FIGURES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN THE </p><p>NORTH.  EQUALLY, NORTHERN POLITICS ARE PULLED IN </p><p>CONFLICTING DIRECTIONS BY THE CONTINUED INFLUENCE OF </p><p>THE TRADITIONAL RULERS AND THE HABITS OF DEFERENCE TO </p><p>ELDERS AND REFUSAL TO SPEAK ILL OF THOSE IN AUTHORITY. </p><p>THE NORTH IS HOME TO TWO STRONG TRADITIONS -- MOSLEM </p><p>CONSERVATISM AND A POPULIST RADICALISM.  IF ADDITION, </p><p>GENERATIONAL FISSURES APPEARED IN THE ABORTED </p><p>TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY WHICH COULD PROVE AN EVEN </p><p>STRONGER CHALLENGE TO TRADITION AND THE ELDERS IF THE </p><p>PROGRAM EVER GETS ON TRACK AGAIN.  ONCE POLITICS RESUME </p><p>OPENLY, THERE ARE SEVERAL PERSONS AND GROUPS READY TO </p><p>PICK UP WHERE IBB LEFT THEM LAST JUNE 23.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A LITTLE HISTORY </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE RUN-UP TO INDEPENDENCE IN THE 1950S, THE </p><p>NORTHERN REGION SPAWNED THREE DISTINCT POLITICAL </p><p>MOVEMENTS WHICH ARE STILL LARGELY MIRRORED IN CURRENT </p><p>POLITICS.  THE ONE THAT WAS ULTIMATELY VICTORIOUS IN </p><p>THE NORTHERN REGIONAL ELECTIONS AND THE FORERUNNER FOR </p><p>THE NATIONAL PARTY OF NIGERIA (NPN) OF THE SECOND </p><p>REPUBLIC AND THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONVENTION (NRC) </p><p>OF THE SECOND-AND-A-HALF REPUBLIC, WAS THE NPC, </p><p>NORTHERN PEOPLES CONGRESS.  THIS PARTY WAS THE HOME OF </p><p>THE TRADITIONAL, HAUSA AND FULANI CONSERVATIVES AND </p><p>STILL PROVIDES THE MODEL FOR SOUTHERN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT </p><p>"NORTHERN POLITICAL DOMINATION." </p><p> </p><p>4.  THERE WERE, HOWEVER, TWO OTHER POLITICAL MOVEMENTS </p><p>WITH CHARISMATIC LEADERS IN NORTHERN NIGERIA.  ONE WAS </p><p>THE RADICAL POPULIST NORTHERN ELEMENTS PROGRESSIVE </p><p>UNION (NEPU) WHOSE LEADER WAS AMINU KANO.  THIS GROUP </p><p>WAS CENTERED IN KANO WHICH WAS AND IS STILL TODAY HOME </p><p>TO POLITICAL CURRENTS DIRECTLY AT ODDS WITH THE </p><p>NORTHERN "ESTABLISHMENT."  THIS STRAIN OF POLITICAL </p><p>THOUGHT ACCOUNTED FOR THE STRONG VOTE FOR ABIOLA IN </p><p>KANO ON JUNE 12, AS WELL AS FOR THE NEARLY EVEN SPLIT </p><p>BETWEEN NRC AND SDP IN THE CIVILIAN STATE GOVERNMENTS </p><p>OF KANO, KADUNA, AND KATSINA THAT HAVE JUST BEEN </p><p>ABOLISHED.  NEPU WAS THE FOREFATHER OF THE PEOPLES </p><p>REDEMPTION PARTY (PRP) OF THE SECOND REPUBLIC (ALSO </p><p>HEADED BY AMINU KANO), BUT ITS HEIRS SPLIT IN KANO AND </p><p>KADUNA BETWEEN THE SDP (PEOPLES\' SOLIDARITY PARTY (PSP) </p><p>FACTION) AND NRC WHEN THE PARTIES WERE ORGANIZED BY </p><p>BABANGIDA IN 1989.  MALLAM AMINU KANO DIED IN 1983, BUT </p><p>IS STILL WIDELY REVERED BY NORTHERNERS WHO SAW HIM AS </p><p>AN INCORRUPTIBLE POLITICIAN OF SIMPLE TASTES AND </p><p>SPARTAN LIFESTYLE, QUITE AT ODDS WITH THE NIGERIAN NORM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE THIRD POLITICAL MOVEMENT WAS THE UNITED MIDDLE </p><p>BELT CONGRESS LED BY JOSEPH TARKA (A TIV FROM CURRENT </p><p>BENUE STATE).  TARKA PRESSED STRONGLY FOR A FOURTH </p><p>REGION COMPRISING THE MIDDLE BELT MINORITIES (NOWADAYS </p><p>FOUND IN TARABA, BENUE, KOGI, PLATEAU, NIGER, KWARA, </p><p>AND SOUTHERN KADUNA STATES) BUT LOST OUT.  WE HAVE BEEN </p><p>TOLD HIS PLAN WAS SHOT DOWN LARGELY AT THE INSTANCE OF </p><p>ANTHONY ENAHORO (NOW THE HEAD OF THE MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>NATIONAL REDEMPTION), AN INDIGENE OF EDO STATE.  OF </p><p>COURSE, NOT LONG AFTER INDEPENDENCE, ENAHORO MANAGED TO </p><p>PUSH THROUGH THE CREATION OF A FOURTH REGION FOR HIS </p><p>OWN ETHNIC GROUP, AN EVENT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN </p><p>IN THESE PARTS.  TARKA WAS ELECTED TO THE SECOND </p><p>REPUBLIC SENATE BUT DIED IN 198O.  NEVERTHELESS, THE </p><p>MIDDLE BELT CONSIDERS ITSELF TO HAVE A SEPARATE </p><p>POLITICAL EXISTENCE FROM THE FAR NORTH (WITH PERHAPS </p><p>THE EXCEPTION OF NIGER STATE), AND VOTED FAIRLY </p><p>STRONGLY FOR THE NIGERIA PEOPLES\' PARTY (NPP) (OR, IN </p><p>BORNO AND GONGOLA, THE GREAT NIGERIA PEOPLES\' PARTY </p><p>(GNPP)) IN 1979 AND SDP IN THE 1991-93 ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE SARDAUNA </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  AT INDEPENDENCE, THE NORTHERN REGION GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>CAPTURED BY THE NPC, WHICH ELECTED SIR AHMADU BELLO, </p><p>THE SARDAUNA OF SOKOTO, AS PREMIER.  GIVEN THE FACT </p><p>THAT THE LAND MASS OF THE NORTHERN REGION WAS AT LEAST </p><p>TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY AND THE DEVOLUTION OF POWER </p><p>FROM THE CENTER TO THE REGIONS UNDER THE FIRST </p><p>CONSTITUTION, THE SARDAUNA WAS AN IMMENSELY POWERFUL </p><p>FIGURE.  HE WAS A PRINCE OF THE SOKOTO RULING FAMILY </p><p>BUT, REPORTEDLY, WAS REGARDED BY THE OPEN RULING SULTAN </p><p>WITH SOME SUSPICION, AND SO THE SULTAN WAS HAPPY TO </p><p>HAVE HIM OUT OF SOKOTO AND IN KADUNA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THERE APPEARS TO BE NO DOUBT THAT THE SARDAUNA WAS </p><p>A FIGURE LARGER THAN LIFE.  HE WAS, TO BEGIN WITH, </p><p>PHYSICALLY IMPOSING.  BUT, FOR THOSE NORTHERN ELDERS </p><p>WHO SERVED IN HIS GOVERNMENT AND ARE STILL ACTIVE (ISA </p><p>KAITA, LIMAN CIROMA, AHMED TALIB, YAHAYA GUSAU, </p><p>AMBASSADOR JOLLY TANKO YUSUF, MAITAMA SULE, AND MANY </p><p>OTHERS), HIS INFLUENCE IS STILL PALPABLE.  HE IS </p><p>REGARDED AS INCORRUPTIBLE, DEEPLY CONCERNED TO MOVE THE </p><p>NORTH FROM ITS CONDITION OF BACKWARDNESS, AND DEEPLY </p><p>RELIGIOUS.  HIS DEATH AT THE HANDS OF THE PERPETRATORS </p><p>OF THE FIRST 1966 COUP IS CONSIDERED A MARTYRDOM AND </p><p>THE HOUSE HE OCCUPIED IS A NORTHERN SHRINE (NOW THE </p><p>HEADQUARTERS OF AREWA HOUSE, A RESEARCH AND </p><p>DOCUMENTATION CENTER FOR NORTHERN NIGERIA).  HIS </p><p>PORTRAIT IS STILL HAWKED AT EVERY MAJOR GATHERING AND </p><p>FUND LAUNCHING IN THE NORTH. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THOSE WHO REMEMBER THE SARDAUNA RECOUNT THE STORIES </p><p>OF HIS VISITS THROUGHOUT THE NORTH, EVEN TO REMOTE </p><p>AREAS ON THE MAMBILLA PLATEAU AND OTHER SETTLEMENTS OFF </p><p>THE BEATEN TRACK.  THEY WILL MENTION THE JOY WITH WHICH </p><p>THE LOCAL INHABITANTS GREETED HIM, AND THOSE WHO SERVED </p><p>IN HIS GOVERNMENT WILL EMPHASIZE THAT MOSLEM, </p><p>CHRISTIAN, AND PAGAN ALIKE GAVE HIM THEIR ALLEGIANCE. </p><p>THE SARDAUNA\'S PROGRESSES THROUGHOUT THE NORTH INVOLVED </p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF CLOTH AND SMALL HOUSEHOLD WARES, AS </p><p>WELL AS COMMITMENTS TO CONSTRUCT SCHOOLS AND OTHER </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.  FROM MORE </p><p>IMPARTIAL SOURCES, WE LEARN THAT THE GOODIES WERE </p><p>ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTED TO THOSE VILLAGES AND PERSONS WHO </p><p>CONVERTED TO ISLAM; EVEN VILLAGES WHICH HAD BEEN MOSLEM </p><p>FOR SOME TIME CLAIMED TO HAVE RECENTLY CONVERTED IN </p><p>ORDER TO COLLECT THE "DASH."  ONE CHRISTIAN CONTACT OF </p><p>THE CONSULATE WHO HAILS FROM LOKOJA REMEMBERS SXWNDIN </p><p>WITH HIS SCHOOL CLASS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO </p><p>WELCOME THU SARDAUNA TO KOGI DISTRICT.  WHEN, AFTER A </p><p>LONG DELAY, THE PREMIER ACTUALLY APPEARED, HE RESPONDED </p><p>TO THE WELCOME BY REMARKING AUDIBLY WITHIN OUR </p><p>CONTACT\'S HEARING, "IS THERE SUCH A PLACE AS KOGI </p><p>DISTRICT?"  OUR CONTACT HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN THE </p><p>IMPRESSION THIS MADE ON HIM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THIS HISTORY HAS SOME RELEVANCE TO POLITICS TODAY </p><p>SINCE MUCH OF THE SARDAUNA\'S STYLE CARRIES OVER.  THE </p><p>CIVILIAN GOVERNORS OF THE ABORTEDHZHIRD REPUBLIC FROM </p><p>THE NORTHERN STATES CONSIDERED THEIR STATES "MOSLEM," </p><p>AS THOUGH IT WAS NORMAL TO GIVE STATE MONEY TO MOSLEM </p><p>FUND RAISINGS.  THE BABANGIDA HABIT OF FINANCING </p><p>GOVERNMENT BY "PERSONAL" DONATION MAY ALSO REFLECT THE </p><p>SARDAUNA\'S STYLE.  WE OBSERVE IN THE NORTH LITTLE </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF THE NECESSITY FOR A GOVERNMENT TO BE </p><p>NEUTRAL IN MATTERS OF RELIGION, EXCEPT FOR CHRISTIANS </p><p>LIVING IN PREDOMINATELY MOSLEM AREAS.  IN SOME STATES, </p><p>SUCH AS KADUNA OR PLATEAU, THE DEPUTY GOVERNORS WERE </p><p>ADHERENTS OF THE OPPOSITE RELIGION AND SOME EFFORT WAS </p><p>MADE TO MAKE EQUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO BOTH RELIGIOUS OR </p><p>TO SEND EQUAL NUMBERS OF PERSONS ON BOTH THE HAJJ AND </p><p>THE "CHRISTIAN PILGRIMAGE" TO ROME AND JERUSALEM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE THIRD REPUBLIC </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  BY FORCING THE NASCENT POLITICAL PARTIES OF THE </p><p>THIRD REPUBLIC INTO TWO COALITIMNS CALLA NRC AND SDP, </p><p>BABANGIDA\'S TRANSITION DID NOT CHANGE POLITICS IN THE </p><p>NORTH IN ANY FUNDAMENTAL WAY.  THE TRADITIONAL, FAR </p><p>NORTH GENERALLY FELL INTO THE NRC, WHILE THE </p><p>"PROGRESSIVEE NORTH (BTRNO, YOBE, KANO CITY, AND THE </p><p>MIDDLE BELT) WERE STRONG FOR THE SDP.  EACH PARTY MADE </p><p>ITS TRADITIONAL ALLIANCES WITH THE GROUPS IN THE SOUTH </p><p>-- THE "ROGRESSIVES" WITH THE YORUBA AND THE </p><p>"TRADITIONALISTS" WITH THE EAST. </p><p> </p><p>11.  WHAT WAS PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE </p><p>WAS THE EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE BABANGIDA THEORISTS </p><p>TO ELIMINATE THE "OLDBREED" FROM THE PLAYING FIELD AND </p><p>ENCOURAGE THE EMERGENCE OF "NEWBREED" POLITICIANS. </p><p>SINCE THE BAMNING EVEN FROM POLITICAL ACTIVITY AND </p><p>SUPPORT OF CANDIDATES ON THE PART OF THE OLDBREED </p><p>REMAINED IN FORCE THROUGH THE GUBERNATORIAL ELECTIONS </p><p>OF DECEMBER 1991, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, GOVERNORS, AND </p><p>STATE HOUSES OF ASSEMBLY ELECTED WERE COMPOSED ALMOST </p><p>ENTIRELY OF YOUNGER, POLITICALLY INEXPERIENCED PEOPLE. </p><p>A NUMBER OF NORTHERN OBSERVERS HAVE REMARKED THAT, IN </p><p>THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY AT LEAST, THIS DID NOT SERVE </p><p>THE PUBLIC WELL.  THE NORTHERNERS AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>CONFERENCE HAD, FOR EXAMPLE, ARGUED AGAINST THE </p><p>EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ELECTIVE OFFICE, SINCE </p><p>THIS WOULD ELIMINATE A NUMBER OF RESPECTED LOCAL </p><p>LEADERS WHO HAD LITTLE SCHOOLING.  NORTHERNERS MAINTAIN </p><p>THAT THE SOUTHERN REPRESENTATIVES PUSHED THIS THROUGH, </p><p>AND THAT THE SOUTH HAD MUCH BETTER LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>CHAIRMEN ON BALANCE THUNHLE NORHEP </p><p>CZIOLDERPDMOEUN </p><p>OF TH COMUNITIES IN THE SOUTH ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO </p><p>HAVE FINISHED SECONDARY SCHOOL. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE RECENT ABORTED TRANSITION ALSO ADVANCED </p><p>FISSURES ALONG GENERATIONAL LINES.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>OLD NPC/NPN/NRC TRADITION, THE PARTY ELDERS ARE </p><p>SUPPOSED TO CONVENE AND DECIDE WHO THE CANDIDATE WILL </p><p>BE.  THE FITS AND STARTS OF BANNING AND UNBANNING </p><p>OHOROUGHLYHDIQNUPTED THIS PROCESS THE LAST TPME </p><p>AROUND.  WHEN THE OLDBREED WERE UNBANNED, ADAMU CIROMA </p><p>WAS ABLE TO MAKE A BID FOR THE NRC NOMINATION AND </p><p>EVERYONE EXPECTED UMARU SHINKAFI, HIS JUNIOR, WOULD </p><p>YIELD THE FLOOR.  SHINKAFI REFUSED TO DO THIS.  AFTER </p><p>THE WHOLE "BAND OF 23" WAS BANNED AND THE PRIMARIES OF </p><p>\'92 WERE CANCELLED, OPTION A4 WAS ADOPTED.  HERE AGAIN, </p><p>THE NEWBREED LIKE BASHIR TOFA SEIZED THE ADVANTAGE </p><p>OFFERED OF ELIMINATING RIVALS AT THE EARLIEST STAGES BY </p><p>SIZABLE PAYOFFS.  TOFA LOPPED OFF THE CHALLENGE IN KANO </p><p>STATE FROM AMINU WALI AND IN KADUNA FROM GOWON AND, IN </p><p>SO DOING, DEEPLY OFFENDED THE "ELDERS."  THEIR REFUSAL </p><p>TO CAMPAIGN FOR HIM OR, INDEED, TO VOTE FOR HIM, GOES A </p><p>LONG WAY TO EXPLAIN THE MASSIVE SUPPORT FOR ABIOLA IN </p><p>PLACES LIKE KANO AND BAUCHI. </p><p> </p><p>13.  QUITE A NUMBER OF NORTHERN SDP ADHERENTS NOW </p><p>OPENLY CHALLENGE WHAT THEY SEE AS THE DEAD HAND OF THE </p><p>TRADITIONAL RULERS AND THE OLDER POLITICAL GENERATION. </p><p>THEY REFUSE TO SEE WHY THEY SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY BOW TO </p><p>THE DECISIONS OF THE ELDERS.  MANY CONTEMPTUOUSLY </p><p>DISMISS THE EFFORTS OF THE TRADITIONAL RULERS TO PULL </p><p>STRINGS BEHIND THE SCENES.  SO FAR, THESE JUNIORS ARE </p><p>STILL SWIMMING AGAINST THE TIDE, BUT THEY DO REPRESENT </p><p>THE FORCES OF THE FUTURE.  THE DEAD SARDAUNA AND THE </p><p>NORTHERN TRADITION HE INSTITUTIONALIZED IS FADING FROM </p><p>THE MEMORIES OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION.  THE "NEWBREED" </p><p>DO, IN THIS SENSE AT LEAST, REPRESENT A MORE GENUINELY </p><p>DEMOCRATIC AND LESS FEUDAL ORGANIZATION OF POLITICS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE ROAD AHEAD </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  ONCE POLITICS RETURN OPENLY TO NIGERIA, THE NORTH </p><p>IS POISED TO REENTER THE FRAY.  SHORTLY AFTER THE </p><p>ANNULLMENT OF THE JUNE 12 ELECTION, VARIOUS MEETINGS OF </p><p>NORTHERN POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE PRESS. </p><p>ONE, SPEARHEADED BY FORMER SECRETARY TO THE FEDERAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT (UNDER OBASANJO), ALHAJI LIMAN CIROMA, </p><p>COALESCED AROUND THE EFFORT TO FORM A "NATIONAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT" TO TAKE OVER FROM BABANGIDA.  THE ORIGINAL </p><p>IDEA OF THIS GROUP WAS TO FORM A GOVERNMENT MADE UP OF </p><p>POLITICIANS OF ALL STRIPES; WHAT THEY GOT WAS </p><p>SHONEKAN\'S INTERIM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WHICH FELL SHORT </p><p>IN MANY IMPORTANT WAYS OF WHAT THE GROUW HAD HOPEDTO </p><p>FASHON.  NEVERTHELESS, ADAMU CIROMA, BAM,:- 57174, </p><p>AMINU SALEH,DALHATU TAFIDA, AND S.B. DANIYAN IN THE </p><p>CURRENT CABINET ARE MOST LIKELY NOMINEES FROM THIS </p><p>GROUP.  LIMAN CIROMA CONTINUES TBSPSXVA INLUEZAAL </p><p>ROLE BEHID THE SCENES, AS WITNESS HIS AHMADU BELLO </p><p>MEMORIAL LECTURE AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE AREWA </p><p>HOUSE WORKSHOP ON "THE STATE OF THE NATION: WHICH WAY </p><p>FORWARD?"  CONCERNING THIS LATTER IN-GATHERING OF THE </p><p>NORTHERN (AMD SOME SOUTHERN) POLITICAL ELITE, THE FIRST </p><p>PLAN TO ORGANIZE IT OPENLY AS A PREPARATORY SEMINAR FOR </p><p>THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE WAS LATER CHANGED TO PLACE IT </p><p>UNDER THE AUSPICES OF AHMADU BELLO UNIVERSITY.  THIS </p><p>GAVE IT A THIN VEIL OF LEGITIMACY CONSIDERING THE </p><p>CONTINUING PROHIBITION ON POLITICAL MEETINGS AND </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  ALTHOUGH, IN OUR OPINION, THE GROUP AROUND LIMAN </p><p>CIROMA REPRESENTS THE GENUINE OLD GUARD NORTHERN </p><p>POLITICOS, ANOTHER GROUP BEGAN MEETING DURING THE </p><p>SUMMER OF 1993, CALLING ITSELF THE "NORTHERN ELDERS." </p><p>THIS WAS SPEARHEADED BY SUCH PERSONS AS ABDULRAHMAN </p><p>OKENE AND MAITAMA SULE WHO GAVE A CERTAIN COVER, AS </p><p>OLDBREED FORMER CIVIL SERVANTS, TO THE EFFORTS OF THE </p><p>NORTHERN GOVERNORS TO COOPT THE LIMAN CIROMA GROUP. </p><p>THIS GROUP MADE AN EFFORT TO ORGANIZE A CALL FOR IBB TO </p><p>REMAIN IN OFFICE BEYOND AUGUST 27 WHICH, AS WE NOW </p><p>KNOW, CAME TO NAUGHT.  THOSE IN THE CURRENT CABINET </p><p>MOST LIKELY ALIGNED WITH THIS GROUP ARE BASHIR DALHATU </p><p>AND POSSIBLY WADA NAS WHO COMES FROM THE SHINKAFI WING </p><p>OF THE NRC.  MOST RECENTLY, HOWEVER, THE GROUP HELD A </p><p>MEETING ON THE FRINGES OF THE AREWA HOUSE WORKSHIP AND </p><p>ISSUED A DECLARATION CALLING FOR NATIONAL UNITY AND </p><p>SUPPORTING THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>16.  IF THE DEFUNCT NRC POLITICOS HAVE NOT YET PULLED </p><p>THEMSELVES TOGETHER, THE SDP IS AN EVEN STRANGER </p><p>SITUATION.  FOR ONE THING, THEIR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE </p><p>WON THE NON-EVENT ON JUNE 12.  FOR ANOTHER, BABA GANA </p><p>KINGIBE, REPRESENTING ONE WING OF THE NORTHERN SDP, IS </p><p>IN THE INNER CIRCLE OF THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT. </p><p>ABUBAKAR RIMI AND SOLOMON LAR, MEMBERS OF THE CABINET, </p><p>REPRESENT RESPECTIVELY THE RADICAL KANO TRADITION AND </p><p>THE MIDDLE BELT CHRISTIANS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  AND THEN THERE IS LT. GEN. SHEHU MUSA YAR\'ADUA </p><p>(RTD).  HE HAS MADE IT CLEAR HE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE </p><p>ABACHA REGIME, NOR DOES HE CONSIDER IT CAME TO POWER </p><p>LEGITIMATELY.  RECENTLY, HIS STAR WAS GIVEN AN EVEN </p><p>GREATER SHINE BY HIS SEEMINGLY POINTLESS DETENTION FOR </p><p>FIVE DAYS.  HE HAS PLENTY OF MONEY AND GREAT AMBITION. </p><p>HE VERY LIKELY ALSO HAS A GOOD DEAL OF ABILITY TO RUN </p><p>THE COUNTRY.  IRONICALLY, HIS MAJOR DRAWBACK IS THE </p><p>PIS FROM THE NORTH.  MANY NORTHERNERS, INCLUDING PEOPLE </p><p>LIKE LIMAN CIROMA, BELIEVE THAT, WHATEVER DECISIONS ARE </p><p>MADE OR NOT MADE ON ROTATIONAL OFFICES AND ZONING AT </p><p>THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE, IT WILL BE A GREAT MISTAKE IF </p><p>THE NEXT ELECTED PRESIDENT IS FROM THE NORTH.  BUT </p><p>YAR\'ADUA WANTS IT AND HE HAS MANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS </p><p>-- MONEY, ORGANIZATION, CLEAN HANDS IN THE CURRENT MESS </p><p>-- TO CLAIM A RIGHT TO RULE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  NORTHERN NIGERIAN POLITICS ARE PROBABLY IN A STATE </p><p>OF MORE PROFOUND CHANGE THAN POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS IN </p><p>THE SOUTH.  THE HEAVY HUND OF TRADITION HAS PERSISTED </p><p>LONGER HERE, CAUSING INTERGENERATIONAL RESTIVENESS. </p><p>THE FAULT LINES OF THE OLD NORTHERN REGION -- BOTH </p><p>RELIGION AND TRIBE -- STILL EXIST AND IN MANY WAYS CUT </p><p>DEEPER FOLLOWING EIGHT YEARS OF IBB\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>EXACERBATE THEM.  MOST NORTHERNERS BELIEVE THAT, SHOULD </p><p>PUSH COME TO SHOVE AT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE AND THE </p><p>NATION START TO SPLIT UP, THE MIDDLE BELT WILL THROW IN </p><p>ITS LOT WITH THE FAR NORTH AND "PROGRESSIVE" </p><p>NORTHEAST.  WE WOULDN\'T WANT TO BE PRESSED ON THIS AT </p><p>THE MOMENT.  IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THE NORTH HAS NO </p><p>INTENTION OF GIVING UP ON NATIONAL UNITY.   NOR DO </p><p>MAINLINE NORTHERN POLITICIANS INTEND, WE BELIEVE, TO </p><p>TAKE "NON-NEGOTIABLE" STANDS THAT WILL GIVE THE </p><p>SOUTHERNERS AMMUNITION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WEINLAND </p><p></p></div>
