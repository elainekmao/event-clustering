<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 001047 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AL, XF, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT SNUBBING ARAB LEAGUE MEETING </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 75616 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Ambassador reviewed reftel demarche with Shaykh </p><p>Dr. Ahmed Nasser al-Sabah, Office Director for Minister of </p><p>State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed al-Sabah, on </p><p>the morning of March 23.  Shaykh Ahmed informed the </p><p>Ambassador that Dr. Mohammed would not be attending the March </p><p>24 Arab League foreign ministers\' meeting.  Kuwait would be </p><p>represented instead by its Ambassador in Cairo.  Nonetheless, </p><p>Dr. Ahmed assured the Ambassador that Kuwait would work </p><p>against efforts to condemn the US for the action in Iraq. </p><p>However, he said, "we are only one country; we need support </p><p>from others."  He added that one of Kuwait\'s main objectives </p><p>would be to get the Arab League to condemn Iraq for launching </p><p>surface-to-surface missiles at Kuwait even though at the time </p><p>no attack had been launched at it from Kuwaiti soil. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) COMMENT: Dr. Mohammed normally represents the GOK at </p><p>such meetings.  Sending the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Egypt in </p><p>his stead is a clear signal of Kuwait\'s displeasure with the </p><p>recent performance of the Arab League in general and of AL </p><p>Secretary General Amr Moussa in particular. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
