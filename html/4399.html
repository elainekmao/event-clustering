<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002616 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA, AF/PDPA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT WEEKLY GETS NEW EDITOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. The privately owned weekly "Financial Gazette" has na </p><p>   Nqobile Nyathi, 29, as editor.  Nyathi replaces veter </p><p>   journalist Francis Mdlongwa who led the "FinGaz" from </p><p>   1997 to 2002.  Nyathi is the first woman and the </p><p>   youngest editor-in-chief of an independent newspaper </p><p>   Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>2. Nyathi joined the "FinGaz" in 1997 after completing a </p><p>   certificate in journalism at the Harare Polytechnic, </p><p>   Zimbabwe\'s primary media training institution.  Befor </p><p>   becoming editor-in-chief she was the paper\'s news </p><p>   editor, a position she had held since mid-2001.  In </p><p>   other staff changes at the "FinGaz" Abel Mutsakani, 3 </p><p>   becomes Deputy Editor-in-Chief; Sydney Masamvu, 30, </p><p>   Assistant Editor; and MacDonald Dzirutwe, 24, Busines </p><p>   News Editor.  All four are promotions from within and </p><p>   are journalists with solid records of editorial </p><p>   independence. </p><p> </p><p>3. The staffing changes at the "FinGaz" were precipitate </p><p>   by the sudden resignation of former editor-in-chief </p><p>   Francis Mdlongwa.  Under Mdlongwa\'s leadership the </p><p>   "FinGaz" became one of the most respected papers in </p><p>   Zimbabwe, a paper with complete editorial independenc </p><p>   His resignation was the result of change of ownership </p><p>   and a failed attempt by Mdlongwa to put together a </p><p>   consortium of investors to buy the "FinGaz."  Ownersh </p><p>   of the newspaper has passed to an anonymous group of </p><p>   investors, one of whom is rumored to be Gideon Gono, </p><p>   chairman of the government-associated Commercial Bank </p><p>   Zimbabwe.  Gono has acknowledged playing a role in th </p><p>   purchase of the paper but denies being the sole sourc </p><p>   of financing.  Regular readers of the "FinGaz" will b </p><p>   watching for editorial changes under the new owners. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
