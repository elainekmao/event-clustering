(U) The growing threat of possible famine in Ethiopia and </p><p>Eritrea was discussed on a number of occasions on the </p><p>margins of the just concluded WFP Board sessions May 28-June </p><p>3, most notably in a lunch hosted by WFP Executive Director </p><p>Morris on June 2 attended by the United States, European </p><p>Commission, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Italy, the </p><p>Netherlands, and Eritrea. Despite generous donor </p><p>contributions, substantial shortfalls continue to exist as </p><p>both countries start into the "long hungry season." End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>WFP luncheon on June 2 </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) WFP Executive Director Jim Morris hosted, at USDEL\'s </p><p>request, a luncheon at WFP on June 2 attended by the United </p><p>States, European Commission, United Kingdom, Canada, </p><p>Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, and Eritrea (Ethiopia was </p><p>invited but missed the lunch due to an act of the Roman </p><p>gods). </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Morris began the discussion by saying he plans to </p><p>appoint a WFP special representative for the region, along </p><p>the lines of Judith Lewis\' role in southern Africa this past </p><p>year. He also noted that WFP had recently issued a </p><p>new Emergency Operation EMOP (April 2003-March 2004) for </p><p>Ethiopia covering 4.6 million of an estimated 12.5 million </p><p>people at risk (40 percent).  Meanwhile, the gap between </p><p>pledges and actual resources has required WFP to reduce </p><p>rations from 15 kg to 12.5 kg per person - a slow-starvation </p><p>diet - as malnutrition rates continue to climb.  Even if all </p><p>the pledges are immediately fulfilled, the pipeline is </p><p>expected to approach the breaking point in August.  WFP has </p><p>had to borrow from Ethiopia\'s emergency reserve stocks, </p><p>which are now precariously low and must be reimbursed. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Ethiopia has eclipsed an even worse situation in </p><p>Eritrea, where the needs are immense, WFP has no carry-over </p><p>stocks, and where EMOP coverage has been reduced from the </p><p>planned 738,450 to 400,000 beneficiaries, at 60 percent </p><p>rations. The new EMOP for Eritrea (May 2003-end February </p><p>2004) to cover 899,000 beneficiaries, is looking at a </p><p>shortfall of 87,110 metric tons which will need to arrive as </p><p>early as July. WFP is shifting some resources from its </p><p>school feeding programs, as families abandon villages and </p><p>trek in search of aid.  Two regions are entirely without </p><p>water, which according to WFP is scarcer and a bigger </p><p>problem than food.  Morris continued that during his visit </p><p>to the region, he saw a dramatic difference between villages </p><p>which had received even modest development assistance and </p><p>those which had not, in terms of their ability to cope with </p><p>the drought.  He noted that Ethiopia and Eritrea are among </p><p> </p><p>the largest recipients of relief aid and among the lowest </p><p>for development.  He added that the UN SYG would raise at </p><p>the G-8 summit the need to mobilize a rapid and large </p><p>response for the region.  Morris said that Ethiopia and </p><p>Eritrea are his top priority. Note: It was pointed out that </p><p>Eritrea has not permitted food-for-work activities since </p><p>1996 and that DANIDA (Denmark) had withdrawn its development </p><p>support to Eritrea\'s agricultural sector. End note. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Ambassador Tony Hall welcomed Morris\' comments and </p><p>added that in his meeting earlier that day with Secretary </p><p>Powell, he advised that the current crisis in the Horn </p><p>appears to be as devastating as the famine of 1984.  The </p><p>Ambassador mentioned a proposal by Congressman Frank Wolf </p><p>that the UN designate a special representative to mobilize </p><p>an immediate and effective response. (The UK ambassador </p><p>Anthony Beattie later noted that Irish rock musician Bob </p><p>Geldof was again playing a prominent advocacy role for the </p><p>Horn as he had previously done in 1984-85).  Hall said that </p><p>WFP appeared to be the only UN agency focused on responding </p><p>to an enormous humanitarian crisis and that greater </p><p>attention and involvement of the other UN relief agencies, </p><p>as well as international donors, was needed now.  DCHA/FFP </p><p>Director Lauren Landis said that a USAID-funded nutritional </p><p>survey/study to be released on June 6 indicated that there </p><p>is, indeed, "a (potential) famine on our watch."  Coping </p><p>mechanisms are so exhausted and donor response has been so </p><p>inadequate thus far, that she advised WFP may wish to </p><p>consider revising upwards the total population at risk in </p><p>Ethiopia from 12.5 to 14.4 million people. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) As donors did a tour de table, many complained that </p><p>too few structural changes had been taken after the drought </p><p>in the Horn in 2000.  WFP\'s Judith Lewis and Manuel Aranda </p><p>da Silva (WFP\'s Regional Manager for West Africa) countered </p><p>that even under the best of circumstances, such changes </p><p>would have required more than three years to prevent the </p><p>recurrence of such a crisis in a region with neither the </p><p>time nor the means to recover from successive natural </p><p>disasters.  Along with Morris, the Ambassador, and Landis, </p><p>they re-focused the discussion on responding to the </p><p>immediate needs and mitigating a potential famine. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Later on June 2, the WFP Executive Board also noted a </p><p>statement (submitted by the United States) calling upon </p><p>donors to fulfill their pledges and provide additional </p><p>resources for the emergency in Ethiopia and Eritrea.  Morris </p><p>stressed these same points in both the Executive Board </p><p>meetings and the Resource Consultations with donors on June </p><p>3. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Text of U.S. Statement submitted to the Executive Board on </p><p>June 2 which will be incorporated in the Summary of the Work </p><p>of the Second Regular Session of the Executive Board, 2003 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Begin text of resolution: </p><p> </p><p>(U) The Executive Board of WFP wants to express its sincere </p><p> </p><p>concern about the critical situation in the Horn of Africa. </p><p>Given the pictures we have seen and the reports we have </p><p>heard, we are seized with the reality that famine is again </p><p>threatening people throughout Ethiopia and Eritrea. </p><p>(U) As expressed in the Common Appeals Process, there are 12- </p><p>14 million people threatened with starvation in Ethiopia and </p><p>1.5 million in Eritrea.  Now more than ever, the world must </p><p>realize the importance of taking immediate action in order </p><p>to save lives.  While we are familiar with the specter of </p><p>famine in this region of the world, we must not let our </p><p>consciences become tired of responding to those in need. </p><p> </p><p>(U) We commend the World Food Programme for acting to feed </p><p>almost eight million people, especially given the pressing </p><p>needs elsewhere.  While we recognize that there are many </p><p>hungry people throughout the world and that we cannot </p><p>neglect them, we see the crisis in the Horn of Africa as our </p><p>top priority at this time. </p><p> </p><p>(U) We urge the entire UN system and donor governments - </p><p>both old and new, big and small - to recognize the magnitude </p><p>and severity of the situation.  We recognize the need to </p><p>work together, especially when the immediate crisis has </p><p>passed, in order to prevent this situation in the future. </p><p>While our response to the threat of famine has improved, it </p><p>still needs to be strengthened in order to guarantee that </p><p>famine will never again threaten the Horn of Africa or </p><p>elsewhere.  Our moral duty demands no less. </p><p> </p><p>(U) End text of resolution. Note: The Summary of Work is </p><p>under circulation and will be formally endorsed by the Board </p><p>at its next formal session. End note. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Operational discussions in USDEL side meetings </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>9 (U) In an earlier, separate meeting, WFP Central and East </p><p>Africa Regional Director Holdbrook Arthur confirmed that the </p><p>U.S. has covered 33 percent of the new EMOP for Ethiopia but </p><p>unmet needs to date amount to another 200,000 MT.  He </p><p>indicated that WFP has one-third of what it needs for </p><p>Eritrea, where the new EMOP is 87,110 mts short. The </p><p>Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation (PRRO) (January </p><p>2003-December 2004) is under funded to the tune of 83,050 </p><p>mts. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Holdbrook commented that WFP\'s Early Warning </p><p>Matrix acknowledges that previous assessments had </p><p>underestimated food aid needs in many parts of Ethiopia and </p><p>notes that the U.S. and some other donors believe there is </p><p>the potential for famine, with the peak of requirements from </p><p>April to June. Meanwhile, floods in the Somali region of </p><p>Gode have led to 100,000 people requiring immediate </p><p>emergency assistance. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) According to an EC press release issued from Addis </p><p>Ababa on May 26, the EC delivered 94,000 MT to Ethiopia in </p><p>the period February 2003-end-May 2003, versus 407,250 MT </p><p> </p><p>pledged for the year 2003.  The press release included a </p><p>delivery schedule for 212,500 MT to arrive end May-end </p><p>August, as follows: 55,000 mts in May through Djibouti; </p><p>30,000 mts in June through Djibouti and 25,000 mts through </p><p>Berbera; 62,500 mts in July through Djibouti and 25,000 mts </p><p>through Berbera; and 15,000 mts in August through Berbera. </p><p>This information was confirmed separately by FFP. Note: The </p><p>EC shipments include cargoes for the GFDRE/DPPC, NGOs, ICRC </p><p>and WFP. End note. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) According to WFP\'s Arthur, the WFP Ethiopia </p><p>pipeline will likely break in August, and there is presently </p><p>a serious shortfall of blended foods needed to prevent </p><p>malnutrition among children under five. He confirmed that </p><p>distributions of blended foods had been inadequate in the </p><p>first half of 2003. Arthur added that there is a 300,000 </p><p>metric ton shortfall for Ethiopia to cover needs through </p><p>December. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Arthur also indicated that rations to refugees in </p><p>Ethiopia will probably be cut, including those for the </p><p>repatriation of 25,000 Somalis.  He could not answer </p><p>State/PRM\'s questions about the substantive number of </p><p>refugees and conflict victims dropped from the Eritrea PRRO </p><p>10192.0, e.g., the criteria used, any provisions for another </p><p>donor to help this caseload, etc.  PRM made its </p><p>dissatisfaction clear and requested WFP to follow up </p><p>immediately. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Clearly considerable additional work needs to be </p><p>done now to avert the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia and </p><p>Eritrea from further spinning out of control. While </p><p>remaining firmly committed to long-term "solutions," we need </p><p>to intensify our focus on saving lives today.
