CLASSIFIED BY DCM RICHARD A.ALBRIGHT FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  In a meeting with Econchief 3/8 (other </p><p>topics septel, notal), UAE Central Bank Governor </p><p>Sultan bin Nasser Al-Suweidi stated that the </p><p>planned Second International Conference on Hawala, </p><p>scheduled for April 2-3 in Abu Dhabi, has been </p><p>postponed.  A formal notification would be issued </p><p>shortly, but the decision had already been taken </p><p>owing to poor response (only 20 participants had </p><p>signed up on the Central Bank\'s website and not all </p><p>these were firm acceptances).  Econchief noted that </p><p>the USG strongly supported the conference and had </p><p>planned to participate with a sizable delegation. </p><p>Al-Suweidi acknowledged this, but said that </p><p>concerns about a likely conflict with Iraq had </p><p>probably contributed to the lack of broader </p><p>international support.  The conference could be </p><p>rescheduled, should there be sufficient interest, </p><p>at a later date -- he would consult further with </p><p>the FATF. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  With regard to the UAE\'s own regulations </p><p>governing hawala, the Governor noted that now that </p><p>approximately 30 hawaladars had come forward to </p><p>register voluntarily, the UAE authorities are </p><p>reaching out to those believed to be active in the </p><p>business -- but who had not registered -- and </p><p>"inviting" them to register.  Al-Suweidi observed </p><p>that this process of "invitation" had only been </p><p>necessary in a small number of cases; he was </p><p>pleased that the vast majority of registrations had </p><p>been purely voluntary. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
