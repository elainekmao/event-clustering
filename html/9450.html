<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001689 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IPC: Susan Wilson </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIPR, ECON, ETRD, HO </p><p>SUBJECT:  HONDURAS: WIPO COPYRIGHT TREATIES ARE IN EFFECT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 174496 </p><p> </p><p>1.  On July 10 EconOff delivered reftel demarche to </p><p>Marvin Discua, head of the GOH\'s Intellectual Property </p><p>Rights office.  Discua confirmed that Honduras became </p><p>party to both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO </p><p>Performances and Phonograms Treaty on May 20, 2002.  He </p><p>further explained that under Honduran law, such treaties </p><p>are self-executing, and that no additions or changes to </p><p>national law are necessary for the treaties to acquire </p><p>the full force of law.  While in some cases the GOH will </p><p>write rules to provide for the clear implementation of a </p><p>treaty, Discua stated that, in his opinion, the WCT and </p><p>WPPT were already sufficiently clear, and writing an </p><p>additional layer of rules was not necessary.  He said </p><p>that there have been no problems with the implementation </p><p>of the treaties. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Comment: Post has received no complaints from U.S. </p><p>companies operating in Honduras pertaining to the issues </p><p>covered by the two treaties.  EconOff forwarded reftel\'s </p><p>recommendation that `self-execution\' of the treaties </p><p>should be considered insufficient, but Discua made clear </p><p>that the GOH does not believe there is further </p><p>legislative work to be done on this issue.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
