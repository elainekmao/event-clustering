<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002649 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/23/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, SW, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: DEATH OF SWEDISH DIPLOMAT ON ROAD FROM BAGHDAD MAY </p><p>CONVINCE MORE TO FLY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Jonas Weiss, Sweden\'s Amman-based Iraq Watcher, was </p><p>killed in a car accident on the Amman-Baghdad road on </p><p>Wednesday, May 22.  Weiss was returning to Amman after </p><p>spending several days making a periodic visit to Iraq.  The </p><p>accident took place at approximately 0430 in morning, about </p><p>100km west of the Jordan-Iraq border. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Increasing numbers of Amman-based diplomats have begun </p><p>to fly to Baghdad, avoiding the 10 hour hazardous drive.  Dr. </p><p>Claude Ellner, Germany\'s Amman-resident Charge in Baghdad </p><p>told us that Greek, French, Spanish and other diplomats have </p><p>flown of late.  Mr. Mihara of the Japanese Embassy\'s Iraq </p><p>Section said that the UN is also considering whether to allow </p><p>its Baghdad staff to take advantage of the regular </p><p>humanitarian flights operating from Amman.  We expect that </p><p>Jonas Weiss\' tragic death will increase pressure to allow </p><p>diplomatic personnel to travel to Iraq by air, rather than on </p><p>the dangerous Amman-Baghdad highway. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Bio Note: Weiss arrived in Amman in the summer of 2001 </p><p>and quickly became a familiar face on the Amman diplomatic </p><p>circuit, freely sharing his observations of life in Baghdad </p><p>and other parts of Iraq.  On this most recent trip he had </p><p>traveled to Basra.  He spent a portion of his youth in </p><p>Washington D.C., graduated from American University, and had </p><p>served previously at the Swedish Embassies in Moscow and </p><p>Belgrade. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
