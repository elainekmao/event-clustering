<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005823 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM AND NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, KPAL, KWBG, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MONITORING AND EVALUATING SEEDS OF PEACE\'S </p><p>COEXISTENCE CENTER IN JERUSALEM </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 148171 </p><p> </p><p>1.  AS REQUESTED REFTEL, REGIONAL REFCOORD MONITORED PRM- </p><p>FUNDED ACTIVITIES AT SEEDS OF PEACE\'S JERUSALEM CENTER FOR </p><p>COEXISTENCE ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2002.  WE UNDERSTAND PRM/ANE </p><p>MONITORED PRM-FUNDED ACTIVITIES AT THE SEEDS SUMMER CAMP IN </p><p>MAINE AND THEREFORE ARE REPORTING ONLY ON ACTIVITIES AT THE </p><p>JERUSALEM CENTER FOR COEXISTENCE.  REPORT IS KEYED TO </p><p>QUESTIONS PROVIDED REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>A.  ON SEPTEMBER 5, REFCOORD MET WITH SEEDS OF PEACE\'S </p><p>COEXISTENCE CENTER PROGRAM DIRECTOR NED LAZARUS AND SENIOR </p><p>PROGRAM OFFICER JEN MARLOWE.  SEEDS OF PEACE VICE PRESIDENT </p><p>AND COEXISTENCE DIRECTOR BILL MCLAUGHLIN HAS BEEN ABSENT </p><p>FROM JERUSALEM SINCE JUNE 2002, DUE TO HEALTH PROBLEMS. </p><p>OTHER PROGRAM STAFF AT THE COEXISTENCE CENTER INCLUDE: DR. </p><p>REUVEN BARNEIS, SAMI AL-JUNDI, SUZAN KHATIB AND ETHAN </p><p>SCHECHTER.  TWO ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT STAFF (A RECEPTIONIST </p><p>AND JANITOR) ALSO WORK AT THE CENTER. </p><p> </p><p>B. SEEDS OF PEACE IS DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB OF PROMOTING </p><p>COEXISTENCE UNDER VERY DIFFICULT POLITICAL AND SECURITY </p><p>CONDITIONS.  IT HAS REVAMPED ITS APPROACH TO COEXISTENCE </p><p>PROGRAMMING TO ACCOMMODATE CURRENT RESTRICTIONS ON THE </p><p>ABILITY OF PALESTINIANS TO TRAVEL, BRINGING SEEDS </p><p>FACILITATORS TO PALESTINIAN YOUTH AND USING ELECTRONIC MEDIA </p><p>TO KEEP CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION OPEN BETWEEN ISRAELI AND </p><p>PALESTINIAN YOUTH.  MOREOVER, WITH A WELL-TRAINED AND </p><p>ENERGETIC STAFF IN JERUSALEM AND STRONG SUPPORT FROM BOTH </p><p>ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS, SEEDS OF PEACE IS WELL </p><p>POSITIONED TO CARRY OUT THE SENSITIVE YET ESSENTIAL TASK OF </p><p>TOLERANCE AND COEXISTENCE BUILDING.  IF PRM REMAINS </p><p>SATISFIED WITH PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION THROUGHOUT THE COURSE </p><p>OF THIS GRANT, REFCOORD STRONGLY RECOMMENDS PRM CONSIDER </p><p>FUNDING SIMILAR ACTIVITIES IN FY2003. </p><p> </p><p>C.  REFCOORD VISITED THE COEXISTENCE CENTER JUST AS SEEDS </p><p>STAFF WERE REGROUPING FROM THEIR SUMMER CAMP EFFORTS.  THE </p><p>FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE PRM GRANT (MAY-AUGUST) WERE FOCUSED </p><p>SOLELY ON SELECTING AND PREPARING PALESTINIAN YOUTH FOR THE </p><p>SUMMER CAMP (INCLUDING HOLDING ORIENTATION MEETINGS WITH </p><p>OLDER SEEDS); FACILITATING THE YOUTHS\' COEXISTENCE </p><p>ACTIVITIES AT THE CAMP; AND ORGANIZING TWO POST-CAMP </p><p>MEETINGS, WHERE NEW SEEDS COULD MEET THEIR "PEER SUPPORTS," </p><p>OLDER SEEDS WHO HAVE STAYED ACTIVE IN COEXISTENCE PROGRAMS </p><p>AND ARE EAGER TO ENCOURAGE NEW SEEDS TO DO AS WELL.  IN </p><p>EARLY SEPTEMBER, THE COEXISTENCE CENTER WAS JUST BEGINNING </p><p>TO PLAN ITS AUTUMN PROGRAMMING.  SEEDS STAFF WERE ESPECIALLY </p><p>EAGER TO BROADEN THEIR COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES, </p><p>PLANNING TO BRING TOGETHER ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN YOUTH TO </p><p>GATHER DONATIONS FOR DISADVANTAGED YOUTH IN JAFFA.  (NOTE: </p><p>SEPARATE FROM THIS GRANT, SEEDS ALSO HOPES TO DEVELOP </p><p>COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES IN PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS, </p><p>AND LIKELY WILL SEEK PRM FUNDING FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES). </p><p>REFCOORD WILL MONITOR COEXISTENCE CENTER ACTIVITIES AGAIN IN </p><p>LATE NOVEMBER OR EARLY DECEMBER, TO ENSURE THAT ACTIVITIES </p><p>FUNDED BY THE GRANT WERE HELD AS PLANNED. </p><p> </p><p>D.  CURRENT VIOLENCE, TENSIONS AND PHYSICAL BARRIERS </p><p>(CHECKPOINTS AND CURFEWS) BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS </p><p>DEEPLY AFFECT SEEDS OF PEACE\'S ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>COEXISTENCE PROGRAMS.  CURRENTLY, ONLY PALESTINIANS WHO HOLD </p><p>JERUSALEM ID\'S ARE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL TO THE COEXISTENCE </p><p>CENTER, LOCATED IN EAST JERUSALEM.  FOR THIS REASON, SEEDS </p><p>CONSCIOUSLY SELECTED JERUSALEM ID HOLDERS FOR THE FIVE </p><p>SUMMER CAMP SLOTS PAID FOR WITH PRM FUNDING, TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>THE PRM-FUNDED CAMPERS WOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN </p><p>FOLLOW-ON COEXISTENCE ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE 2002-2003 </p><p>SCHOOL YEAR.  IN ORDER TO REACH PALESTINIAN SEEDS WHO RESIDE </p><p>OUTSIDE JERUSALEM, SEEDS HAS SHIFTED PROGRAMMING TO AREAS </p><p>OUTSIDE JERUSALEM, HOLDING PRE-CAMP WORKSHOPS IN THE SUMMER </p><p>OF 2002 IN GAZA, RAMALLAH, JENIN AND BETHLEHEM.  SEEDS </p><p>RELIES GREATLY ON ITS TWO INTERNATIONAL STAFF (LAZARUS AND </p><p>MARLOWE) TO TRAVEL TO PALESTINIAN TOWNS, CITIES AND REFUGEE </p><p>CAMPS TO HOLD FOLLOW-ON COEXISTENCE ACTIVITIES WITH </p><p>PALESTINIAN YOUTH WHO ARE UNABLE TO TRAVEL TO JERUSALEM. </p><p>SUCH ACTIVITIES INCLUDE VIDEO DIALOGUE, INTERNET DIALOGUE </p><p>AND THE DIARIES PROJECT AND OLIVE BRANCH REPORTING. </p><p> </p><p>E.  THE COEXISTENCE CENTER STAFF SEEMS TO BE FULLY AND </p><p>GAINFULLY EMPLOYED.  GIVEN CURRENT RESTRICTIONS ON </p><p>PALESTINIAN TRAVEL WITHIN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA AND TO </p><p>JERUSALEM, SEEDS\' TWO INTERNATIONAL STAFF ARE REQUIRED TO </p><p>SPEND MUCH OF THEIR TIME TRAVELING TO REACH PALESTINIAN </p><p>YOUTH WHO WOULD OTHERWISE REMAIN ISOLATED FROM SEEDS </p><p>PROGRAMMING.  SEEDS PROBABLY COULD DO AN EVEN BETTER JOB OF </p><p>REACHING PALESTINIAN YOUTH IF IT HAD AN ADDITIONAL WORKING- </p><p>LEVEL INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM OFFICER, RATHER THAN A JERUSALEM- </p><p>BASED VICE PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>F.  THE COEXISTENCE CENTER\'S OFFICE IS SPACIOUS AND WELL </p><p>EQUIPPED.  EQUIPMENT APPEARED TO BE IN WORKING ORDER AND </p><p>USED ON A REGULAR BASIS.  NONE OF THE EQUIPMENT WAS </p><p>PURCHASED WITH USG FUNDS. </p><p>G.  N/A </p><p> </p><p>H.  IF FUTURE FUNDING IS PROVIDED FOR PALESTINIAN REFUGEE </p><p>YOUTH TO PARTICIPATE IN SEEDS OF PEACE ACTIVITIES, REFCOORD </p><p>RECOMMENDS THAT PRM WORK WITH SEEDS AND APPROPRIATE </p><p>PALESTINIAN AND ISRAELI OFFICIALS TO ENSURE THAT NON- </p><p>JERUSALEM RESIDENTS ALSO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE SUMMER CAMP </p><p>AND FOLLOW-ON COEXISTENCE ACTIVITIES.  PROMOTION OF </p><p>TOLERANCE AND PROMOTION IS TOO IMPORTANT A POLICY GOAL TO </p><p>LIMIT PARTICIPATION ONLY TO JERUSALEM ID HOLDERS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  CONGEN JERUSALEM CLEARED THIS CABLE. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
