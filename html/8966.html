The Iraqi Director of Ports is very concerned about </p><p>security in the port and is frustrated by his lack of </p><p>knowledge about what is occurring at the port.  Bechtel\'s </p><p>large dredger, the Carolina, is to finish dredging berth 10 </p><p>(bulk grain facility) on 18 June.  It will then turn its </p><p>dredging efforts to the new port.  U. N. Development </p><p>Programs (UNDP) began dredging operations at the old port on </p><p>11 June.  Daily maintenance dredging will be required once </p><p>the initial dredging operations are completed.  Bechtel has </p><p>begun cleaning the grain silos and is doing repairs. </p><p>However, due to continual setbacks, Bechtel is leery of </p><p>giving a start date for the use of the grain facility, but </p><p>hopes for end of July.  Twelve major wrecks have been </p><p>identified under the Umm Qasr waterways.  Ten need to be </p><p>removed, but additional wreckage is continually being </p><p>identified.  Port workers have received April salary </p><p>payments and should soon also receive May and June payments. </p><p>Increased looting from recent ship arrivals of U.N. World </p><p>Food Program (WFP) food has occurred.  There are currently </p><p>84 security guards at the port, however they are not armed </p><p>and there are no current plans to arm them.  In addition, it </p><p>has been decided to train 300 Iraqi ex-navy and ex-coast </p><p>guard to provide security at the new and old ports.  They </p><p>will be uniformed and armed, and their start date is hoped </p><p>to be 20 June, which coincides with the arrival date of </p><p>several WFP-contracted vessels to the old port.  16 June </p><p>marked the opening of the port to commercial traffic.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The weekly port meetings of 5 and 12 June in Umm Qasr </p><p>were co-chaired by Stevedoring Services of America (SSA) and </p><p>the Iraqi Director of Ports, who was elected by the port </p><p>workers in mid-April.  Also in attendance were British </p><p>military officials, Bechtel, Office of the Coalition </p><p>Provisional Authority (OCPA)/Lower South, Naval officers </p><p>from the Bahrain Naval Station, WFP, the Chairman of the Umm </p><p>Qasr Local Council, USAID, and USAID/DART Chief Food </p><p>Officer. </p><p> </p><p>3.  On 5 June, The Director of Ports opened the meeting, </p><p>expressing two priority concerns.  The first was security at </p><p>the port.  He said that Bechtel has had things stolen and </p><p>that the Iraqi police have lost confidence, as they have no </p><p>way to control the looters and have no means of </p><p>communication.  His second concern was repairing the marine </p><p>vessels at the port, such as the tugboats and channel </p><p>cutter. </p><p> </p><p>4.  On 12 June, the Iraqi Director of Ports said that the </p><p>port used to function well and the various workers knew </p><p>their jobs.  Now he is frustrated, as he said he does not </p><p>know what is going on at the port.  There is no revenue </p><p>coming in for him to pay salaries or make upgrades.  (Note: </p><p>The lack of resolution over the port fees charged by SSA </p><p>affects the lack of revenue coming to the port.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>DREDGING </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  Bechtel reported that the "Carolina," which is the very </p><p>large dredger, continues its work at the bulk grain </p><p>facility, berth 10.  When finished, it will have dredged a </p><p>channel 300 meters long, 50 meters wide and 12.5 meters </p><p>deep.  At the berth itself, the depth will be dredged to </p><p>13.5 meters.  Bechtel anticipates completing the job on 18 </p><p>June.  At berth 10, Bechtel has found large objects under </p><p>the water, but they are deeper than 13.5 meters so will not </p><p>affect ships coming into port.  Bechtel is using the one </p><p>Iraqi dredger out of five that is working, the Ramalah, as a </p><p>"washing" tool to clear away other debris at berth 10. </p><p> </p><p>6.  On 19 June, Bechtel plans to begin dredging the new </p><p>port.  It will begin with berths 20 and 21 and dredge to a </p><p>depth of 12.5 meters.  When finished dredging the berths, </p><p>Bechtel has recommended to USAID/Asia Near East Bureau (ANE) </p><p>that it continue to dredge the full length of the new port, </p><p>a swath 200 meters long and 12.5 meters deep, which would </p><p>take five to six months to complete.  There is one wreck </p><p>under this channel that is one of the wrecks to be removed </p><p>by UNDP\'s contract with the Turkish company, but Bechtel </p><p>said that it could dredge around the wreck if UNDP has not </p><p>removed it in time.  Bechtel is awaiting approval from </p><p>USAID/ANE for this last piece. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Bechtel was originally contracted to also dredge the </p><p>berths at the old port but reported that USAID removed the </p><p>old port from its scope of work (SOW).  Bechtel has been </p><p>told that U.N. Development Program (UNDP) received funding </p><p>from the Japanese to dredge the areas at the old port, </p><p>however it is Bechtel\'s understanding that the contract is </p><p>to dredge to a depth of 9.5 meters, which already exists. </p><p>Unfortunately, no representative from UNDP was at the </p><p>meeting to clarify this point or give a start date for the </p><p>UNDP dredging.  Subsequently, DART was successful in </p><p>contacting UNDP.  UNDP reported to DART that it intends to </p><p>dredge all berths at the old port and work began on 11 June. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Before the war, the Iraqis had five dredgers at the </p><p>port.  Bechtel has surveyed the functionality of the </p><p>dredgers and has determined that two should be scrapped for </p><p>parts, two need a complete overhaul, and one is in good </p><p>condition and currently working, the Ramalah. </p><p> </p><p>9.  After all the dredging is completed, daily maintenance </p><p>dredging will be required in the port. </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>GRAIN FACILITY AT UMM QASR </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Bechtel also has the responsibility to clean and repair </p><p>the silos that are part of the grain facility (berth 10) at </p><p>the port and reported on 5 June that work is "behind."  The </p><p>silo complex is huge, with 24 silos, located in between the </p><p>new and old ports and comes under the management of the </p><p>Ministry of Trade Grain Board, rather than the Ports </p><p>Management.  Bechtel reported that it has two emergency </p><p>generators at the silo.  One works well and can power the </p><p>silo, but is insufficient for continual use.  Generator </p><p>power at the silo is required, as Bechtel said that power </p><p>from the sub-station will take "quite awhile to repair."  26 </p><p>additional generators were to arrive 13 June, and will be </p><p>used for the grain facility and to power new lights at the </p><p>old port (lights have been provided by WFP). </p><p> </p><p>11.  Even though cleaning of the silos had begun several </p><p>weeks ago, the original plan failed.  Nevertheless, Bechtel </p><p>is again moving forward with cleaning the silos and making </p><p>repairs.  Bechtel has hired an Iraqi company for the </p><p>cleaning and anticipates that it will take approximately two </p><p>weeks to complete.  (Note:  The cleaning of the silo is a </p><p>pre-requisite to its use.  End Note.)  . </p><p> </p><p>12.  Sabotage at the silo has been a continued problem. </p><p>About two weeks ago, circuit breakers were removed in a </p><p>strategic manner so Bechtel halted the repairs for a few </p><p>days.  During a visit with USAID Administrator Natsios on 16 </p><p>June, Bechtel stated that no looting had occurred in the </p><p>last week.  Bechtel had hoped the grain facility would be </p><p>ready to receive grain by early July.  However, with </p><p>continual setbacks Bechtel is now predicting end July, but </p><p>hesitates to give any date. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>RECOVERING WRECKAGE UNDER THE WATER </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  Bechtel reported that twelve major wrecks have been </p><p>identified under the Umm Qasr waterways.  Two are at berth </p><p>10 and deep enough as not to be problematic.  Bechtel has </p><p>sub-contracted Titan Maritime to remove five of the wrecks, </p><p>and UNDP has the contract for the other five.  Bechtel said, </p><p>however, that if UNDP did not move swiftly enough in </p><p>removing them, that Bechtel would have its sub-contractor do </p><p>the job.  Additional wrecks are continually being </p><p>identified. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>SALARY PAYMENTS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  On 4 June, provision of salary payments to the port </p><p>workers for the month of April was completed.  By 15 June, </p><p>CPA/Lower South anticipates providing payments for May, and </p><p>hopes to give out June salaries by the end of the month. </p><p>These payments are in addition to the 20 USD emergency </p><p>payments. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Because the silo workers come under the MOT\'s Grain </p><p>Board, those workers have not yet been paid, as the list had </p><p>just been compiled and given to CPA/Lower South prior to the </p><p>5 June port meeting.  (Note:  It was said after the meeting </p><p>that the silo workers would prefer to come under the </p><p>management of the port instead of the Grain Board(GB) </p><p>because they consider the GB to be corrupt.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  Security remains a major problem at the port, and </p><p>during the last two days of discharging the M/V Orbit, the </p><p>looting intensified.  On 10 June, WFP told the DART that </p><p>looting of broken food bags had started with the recent </p><p>discharge of WFP ship M/V Nanking (which arrived 2 June) and </p><p>continued with the M/V Orbit.  It intensified however during </p><p>the night of 9 June when a truck came in and loaded up five </p><p>to eight MT of wheat flour.  Subsequently, during the day on </p><p>10 June, the looting further increased when men, armed with </p><p>pistols and grenades, carried away whole bags of wheat flour </p><p>from the M/V Orbit in broad daylight.  No one dared to do </p><p>anything to stop them as the stevedores were frightened. </p><p>(Note:  The M/V Orbit departed on 11 June.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>17.  During the 5 June meeting, the Director of the Ports </p><p>had said that security was his number one concern, which was </p><p>later echoed by the Chairman of the Local Council, saying </p><p>that it is the "key to achieving everything." </p><p> </p><p>18.  SSA stated that security inside the port was its </p><p>responsibility under the USAID contract and the perimeter </p><p>security came under the responsibility of the Coalition </p><p>forces, but that this would end 22 June.  (Note:  Even </p><p>though it was stated that the Coalition currently held the </p><p>responsibility for providing perimeter security at the port, </p><p>it was not clear that this responsibility was wholly </p><p>fulfilled.  End Note.)  Post 22 June, it is uncertain who </p><p>has the responsibility for perimeter security.  The meeting </p><p>attendees felt that CPA and USAID needed to discuss the </p><p>matter.  When DART visited the port on 12 June, no semblance </p><p>of security was witnessed at the old port, including none at </p><p>the entrance gate. </p><p> </p><p>19.  There are currently 84 security guards at the port, </p><p>however they are not armed and there are no current plans to </p><p>arm them.  Their job is access control at the port.  60 of </p><p>the 84 were trained by the British.  SSA will now assume the </p><p>duty of training the remaining 24, as well as new hires. </p><p>The plan is to increase the force to 250.  The Deputy Ports </p><p>Manager said that it was not just a matter of training the </p><p>guards, but also of hiring the right men, as "some were </p><p>malicious."  50 ex-navy police have recently been </p><p>transferred to provide security at the grain facility and </p><p>CPA is trying to arm them.  In addition, one gentleman at </p><p>the meeting announced that armed port police were now </p><p>providing gate security, however neither SSA, the Ports </p><p>Director, nor the British regiment knew anything about them, </p><p>which puzzled the entire group. </p><p> </p><p>20.  On 11 June, a meeting was held at the port, chaired by </p><p>SSA, to discuss security measures.  Also in attendance were </p><p>the Iraqi port management, British military, and WFP.  It </p><p>was decided to train 300 Iraqi ex-navy and ex-coast guard to </p><p>provide security at the new and old ports.  They will be </p><p>uniformed and armed, and their start date is hoped to be 20 </p><p>June, just in time for the arrival of six WFP-contracted </p><p>vessels over one week\'s time which will berth at the old </p><p>port. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>MISCELLANEOUS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  Bechtel plans to begin the survey of the channel very </p><p>soon and estimates that it will take 14 days to complete. </p><p>Following completion of the survey, Bechtel will tender for </p><p>required work. </p><p> </p><p>22.  Bechtel has completed its assessment of the primary </p><p>port building.  The assessment is with USAID awaiting </p><p>approval to proceed with the work. </p><p> </p><p>23.  Also in Bechtel\'s SOW is the repair of marine vessels, </p><p>such as the pilot cutter and tugboats.  As stated above, </p><p>this work is a priority of the Director of the Ports. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>COMMERCIAL TRAFFIC </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  The port ceremonially opened to commercial traffic 16 </p><p>June with a ribbon-cutting ceremony led by USAID </p><p>Administrator Andrew S. Natsios and Ambassador Olsen of </p><p>CPA/Lower South.  SSA states that humanitarian assistance </p><p>shipments will remain their number one priority, even after </p><p>commercial shipments begin.  No customs will be charged </p><p>throughout 2003, but customs checks will be made for </p><p>contraband and unmanifested cargo. </p><p> </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
