<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000950 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Washington and London acting </p><p>      irresponsibly" the pro-government weekly the </p><p>      "Sunday Mirror" dedicated its May 18 editorial </p><p>      to calling on the United States and Britain "to </p><p>      move out of Iraq and let the Iraqis to handle </p><p>      their own affairs."  Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Latest developments relating to the running of </p><p>      post-Saddam Iraq should give the world every </p><p>      reason to worry. . .  While the suspension or </p><p>      total lifting of sanctions would be desirable, </p><p>      what is disturbing is the conditionality - that </p><p>      Iraqi oil riches be under U.S./UK control for a </p><p>      year - that the two countries are seeking to </p><p>      impose.  That in itself sounds like an admission </p><p>      on the part of the two powers that they were not </p><p>      prepared for a purely Iraqi administration </p><p>      following the ouster of Saddam Hussein, a </p><p>      possibility that gives rise to the fear that the </p><p>      two could actually be intending to hold onto, </p><p>      and plunder, Iraq\'s oil.  Of vital importance is </p><p>      for the U.S. and the UK to move out of Iraq and </p><p>      let the Iraqis handle their own affairs." </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
