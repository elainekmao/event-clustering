(C) SUMMARY:  DURING THE EVENING OF OCTOBER 4, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE WILLFULLY IGNORED A COURT ORDER </p><p>AND SHUT DOWN THE RECENTLY LAUNCHED PRIVATE BROADCASTER </p><p>CAPITAL RADIO.  HEAVILY ARMED POLICE (SEVERAL WERE </p><p>CARRYING AK47 ASSAULT RIFLES) APPEARED AT THE RADIO\'S </p><p>MAKESHIFT STUDIO IN THE 5-STAR CROWNE PLAZA HOTEL IN </p><p>DOWNTOWN HARARE AT ABOUT 1600 ON OCTOBER 4 AND DEMANDED </p><p>THAT THE STATION CEASE BROADCASTING.  LAWYERS FOR THE </p><p>RADIO STATION WERE ABLE TO DELAY SHUTDOWN OF THE RADIO </p><p>FOR SEVERAL HOURS, AND OBTAINED A COURT ORDER THAT </p><p>BARRED THE POLICE FROM SEIZING THE STATION\'S EQUIPMENT. </p><p>THE POLICE INITIALLY INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD COMPLY </p><p>WITH THE COURT ORDER, BUT RETURNED AT ABOUT 2300, BROKE </p><p>DOWN THE DOOR TO THE STUDIO, AND SEIZED THE EQUIPMENT. </p><p>DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME, UNIFORMED POLICE AND </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS (PROBABLY CIO </p><p>AGENTS) APPEARED AT THE HOMES OF CAPITAL RADIO\'S MAJOR </p><p>PLAYERS.  THEY ENTERED AND SEARCHED THE HOME OF STATION </p><p>CO-OWNER GERRY JACKSON, AND ESTABLISHED PRESENCE AT, BUT </p><p>DID NOT ENTER, THE HOMES OF OTHER PEOPLE NOW OR </p><p>PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE STATION.  THE TIMING OF </p><p>THE POLICE ACTION AGAINST CAPITAL RADIO\'S BROADCAST </p><p>FACILITIES AND KEY PERSONNEL COINCIDES WITH PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE\'S SIGNING OF A NEW SET OF REGULATIONS GOVERNING </p><p>COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING IN ZIMBABWE.  THE ELEMENTS OF </p><p>THESE NEW REGULATIONS ARE REPORTED IN A SEPARATE </p><p>TELEGRAM.  CAPITAL RADIO IS NOW OFF THE AIR AND FACES A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05651  01 OF 02  051517Z </p><p>FUTURE OF LEGAL BATTLES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ACCORDING TO CAPITAL RADIO CO-OWNER GERRY </p><p>JACKSON AND PRESS ACCOUNTS, A POLICE "SUPPORT UNIT" </p><p>ARMED WITH AK47 ASSAULT RIFLES ARRIVED AT THE RADIO </p><p>STATION\'S MAKESHIFT STUDIOS ON THE 16TH FLOOR OF THE 5- </p><p>STAR CROWNE PLAZA HOTEL IN DOWNTOWN HARARE AT ABOUT 1600 </p><p>ON OCTOBER 4.  THE POLICE WERE ACCOMPANIED BY MEMBERS OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO). </p><p>DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE POLICE, LED BY ASSISTANT </p><p>COMMISSIONER LIBERMAN NDLOVU, AND CAPITAL RADIO\'S </p><p>LAWYERS ANTHONY BROOKS AND JONATHAN SAMKANGE, DELAYED </p><p>POLICE ACTION FOR SEVERAL HOURS.  NDLOVU INITIALLY TOLD </p><p>BROOKS THAT HE WAS "WAITING FOR A SEARCH WARRANT."  THIS </p><p>GAVE THE STATION\'S LAWYERS TIME TO OBTAIN AN ORDER FROM </p><p>HIGH COURT JUDGE ESHMAIL CHATIKOBO BARRING POLICE </p><p>SEIZURE OF EQUIPMENT.  THAT ORDER EXPIRES AT 1600 ON </p><p>OCTOBER 5.  ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER NDLOVU INITIALLY SAID </p><p>THAT HE WOULD RESPECT THE ORDER.  ACCORDING TO JACKSON, </p><p>NDLOVU THEN RECEIVED A CALL FROM INFORMATION MINISTER </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO, AFTER WHICH HE TOLD THE RADIO\'S LAWYERS </p><p>THAT HE WOULD NOT RESPECT THE COURT ORDER.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>POLICE LEFT THE HOTEL AT ABOUT 2230 WITHOUT HAVING </p><p>ENTERED THE HOTEL ROOM SERVING AS THE STATION\'S STUDIO. </p><p>AT THAT POINT, THE RADIO\'S LAWYERS ALSO LEFT THE HOTEL. </p><p>ABOUT 30 MINUTES LATER, AT 2300, HOTEL MANAGEMENT CALLED </p><p>JACKSON TO INFORM HER THAT THE POLICE HAD RETURNED, WERE </p><p>BREAKING DOWN THE DOOR TO THE STUDIO AND SEIZING THE </p><p>EQUIPMENT.  THE STUDIO WAS AUTOMATED AND NO STATION </p><p>STAFF WERE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF THE SEIZURE.  CAPITAL </p><p>RADIO DOES NOT KNOW WHERE ITS EQUIPMENT IS NOW, BUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05651  01 OF 02  051517Z </p><p>ASSUMES IT IS BEING HELD BY THE POLICE OR OTHER </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICERS.  CAPITAL RADIO BEGAN OPERATIONS ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 28 IN THE LEGAL VACUUM CREATED BY THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 22 SUPREME COURT RULING THAT THE EXISTING </p><p>BROADCASTING LAWS WERE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) POLICE ACTION AGAINST PEOPLE NOW AND FORMERLY </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH CAPITAL RADIO ALSO BEGAN AT ABOUT 1600 </p><p>ON OCTOBER 4.  POLICE AND, ACCORDING TO GERRY JACKSON, </p><p>CIO OFFICIALS ENTERED AND SEARCHED HER HOME AT THAT </p><p>TIME.  SHE WAS NOT HOME.  ACCORDING TO MS. JACKSON\'S </p><p>NEIGHBORS, POLICE SAID THAT THEY HAD A WARRANT FOR HER </p><p>ARREST.  JACKSON\'S LAWYER IS CURRENTLY WORKING TO </p><p>DETERMINE WHETHER POLICE HAVE A WARRANT OR SIMPLY A </p><p>DESIRE TO INTERVIEW HER.  POLICE AND NON-UNIFORMED </p><p>GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL ALSO APPEARED AT THE HOMES OF </p><p>STATION CO-OWNER MIKE AURET, JR. (HE WAS NOT HOME), HIS </p><p>FATHER MIKE AURET, SR. (AN OPPOSITION MEMBER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT), AND SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE.  NONE OF THESE </p><p>HOMES WERE ENTERED OR SEARCHED.  JACKSON SAYS THE POLICE </p><p>APPEAR TO BE WORKING FROM OLD DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION </p><p>BECAUSE THEY ARE TARGETING SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN </p><p>ASSOCIATED WITH CAPITAL RADIO FOR MONTHS OR YEARS.

AMONG THE </p><p>HOMES THE POLICE VISITED ON OCTOBER 4 ARE THOSE OF </p><p>FORMER STATION OWNER BRIAN LATHAM (HE SOLD THE STATION </p><p>TO JACKSON AND AURET IN 1999), AND BRIAN POTTS, A FORMER </p><p>CAPITAL RADIO STAFFER WHO EMIGRATED TO AUSTRALIA EARLIER </p><p>THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) GERRY JACKSON AND MIKE AURET, JR. ARE CURRENTLY </p><p>STAYING WITH FRIENDS AND CONSULTING WITH THEIR LAWYERS </p><p>ABOUT THEIR NEXT STEPS.  THE LAWYERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>DETERMINE IF THERE ARE CHARGES OR ARREST WARRANTS </p><p>PENDING AGAINST JACKSON, AURET OR OTHER STATION STAFF. </p><p>GERRY JACKSON, A BRITISH CITIZEN WITH PERMANENT </p><p>RESIDENCE STATUS IN ZIMBABWE, TOLD US THAT POLICE </p><p>COMMISSIONER AUGUSTINE CHIHURI HUNG UP ON BRITISH HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER PETER LONGWORTH WHEN LONGWORTH CALLED TO </p><p>PROTEST THE POLICE INVASION OF JACKSON\'S HOME. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) CAPITAL RADIO\'S LAWYERS ARE ALSO NOW SEEKING AN </p><p>EXTENSION OF THE HIGH COURT\'S ORDER BARRING POLICE FROM </p><p>SEIZING OF THE STATION\'S EQUIPMENT.  ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD </p><p>BE A MOOT ORDER NOW THAT POLICE HAVE IGNORED THE INITIAL </p><p>ORDER AND SEIZED THE EQUIPMENT, IT COULD BE AN IMPORTANT </p><p>STEP IN THE LEGAL BATTLES NOW SHAPING UP. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: THE DUST HAS NOT COMPLETELY SETTLED, </p><p>BUT IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT CAPITAL RADIO\'S IMMEDIATE </p><p>FUTURE IS IN THE COURTS RATHER THAN ON THE AIRWAVES.  AS </p><p>THEY BEGAN BROADCASTING ON SEPTEMBER 28, JACKSON AND HER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05651  02 OF 02  051518Z </p><p>PARTNERS PUBLICLY STATED THAT THEY WOULD ABIDE BY </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S LAWS.  THEIR RECOURSE TO THE HIGH COURT ON </p><p>OCTOBER 4 SHOWS THAT THEY DO INTEND TO OPERATE WITHIN </p><p>THE FRAMEWORK OF THE LAW.  SADLY, THE ACTIONS OF THE </p><p>POLICE, AND PRESUMABLY OF INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN </p><p>MOYO, SHOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SHARE CAPITAL </p><p>RADIO\'S RESPECT FOR THE NATION\'S LAWS.  THIS IS YET </p><p>ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S BLATANT </p><p>CRACK DOWN ON THE MEDIA AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACT </p><p>OUTSIDE THE LAW TO MAKE SURE THE AIRWAVES ARE FULLY </p><p>CONTROLLED BY GOVERNMENT MEDIA.  THIS IS INDEED A </p><p>DISTURBING DEVELOPMENT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
