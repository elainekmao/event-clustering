<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002015 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WSSD; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Demonstrations a seal for land </p><p>      reforms" the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" </p><p>      dedicated its September 2 editorial to criticizing the </p><p>      West for failing to endorse the land reform program in </p><p>      Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Some Western leaders have been working </p><p>      tirelessly to isolate Zimbabwe through the use of </p><p>      targeted sanctions and vicious condemnation of its </p><p>      land reforms.  However, events unfolding in South </p><p>      Africa at the WSSD and elsewhere, have shown beyond </p><p>      any doubt that the devious machinations to throttle </p><p>      Zimbabwe have only served to cement African unity, and </p><p>      isolated the likes of Blair and Bush.  Several </p><p>      conferences and demonstrations are being held </p><p>      alongside the summit in South Africa as people try to </p><p>      register their anger over the way `development\' has </p><p>      been managed, leading to the destabilization of the </p><p>      environment. . .  It was quite interesting that the </p><p>      demonstrators who applauded the President lambasted </p><p>      British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair and American </p><p>      President, Mr. George Bush.  The West should read the </p><p>      signs that Africans can no longer be taken for </p><p>      granted. . .  The land issue is a thorny one in the </p><p>      region since land ownership is still skewed in favor </p><p>      of whites. . .  The calls for land cannot therefore </p><p>      die down before this anomaly is addressed throughout </p><p>      the region and attended to quickly, since the Western </p><p>      countries are ganging up against such initiatives to </p><p>      stall the redistribution of land held by their kith </p><p>      and kin.  We implore the Western leaders to read the </p><p>      mood of the people of Africa and come to their senses </p><p>      instead of trying to propagate notions that will not </p><p>      bring food to our people\'s tables.  It is not too late </p><p>      for the West to give land reforms in the region all </p><p>      the support the programs need.  This would also </p><p>      safeguard their descendants against future wars over </p><p>      land. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The people have spoken, and said that the </p><p>      land issue is an African issue and we hope the </p><p>      likes of Blair and Bush are listening.  Their </p><p>      efforts to divide Africans were dealt another </p><p>      major blow at the weekend when it was revealed </p><p>      by Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique that </p><p>      they were not involved in U.S. plans to remove </p><p>      President Mugabe as the Americans claimed. </p><p>      . . .Zimbabwe is ready to defend its sovereignty </p><p>      and would do so with pride since it will be </p><p>      defending its land, with the full support of </p><p>      fellow Africans in the region.  We are sure Bush </p><p>      and Blair are now feeling isolated and </p><p>      irrelevant, since there is so much principled </p><p>      anger against them across the continent.  Bush </p><p>      even feared to attend the conference!" </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
