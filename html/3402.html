<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001745 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: MUGABE\'S RECENT REMARKS TROUBLING - RULE </p><p>OF LAW AND FINANCIAL SECTOR UNDER ATTACK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer A. Besmer for reasons 1.5(b), (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  On July 25, President Mugabe went on record </p><p>saying that the State would defy court judgments with which </p><p>it did not agree.  He also said gays were worse than pigs and </p><p>dogs, warning Parliament against recognizing homosexual </p><p>marriages.  In a previous July 23 speech at the opening of </p><p>Parliament Mugabe had two major themes--devaluation is dead, </p><p>and land reform is the key to growth.  He proposed various </p><p>spending programs in the agriculture, legal and health </p><p>sectors, but perhaps most troubling, the creation of a </p><p>centralized Financial Services Authority which would tighten </p><p>his grip on the banking sector.  In an address to the </p><p>Zimbabwe Nurses Association on July 27, he lambasted Britain </p><p>for stealing Zimbabwe\'s health workers.  Mugabe\'s remarks </p><p>promise an intensification of economic central planning and </p><p>its destructive consequences, as Britain continues to bear </p><p>the rhetorical blame for all of Zimbabwe\'s woes.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Alluding to Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa\'s </p><p>recent conviction on contempt of court charges, President </p><p>Mugabe said in a July 25 speech at a reception he hosted for </p><p>the opening of Parliament, "if they (judges) are not </p><p>objective, don\'t blame us when we defy them."  In the same </p><p>address, Mugabe said that, "we will respect judges where the </p><p>judgments are true judgments," and "when a judge sits alone </p><p>in his house or with his wife and says \'this one is guilty of </p><p>contempt\' that judgment should never be obeyed."  The </p><p>President went on to say that, "They (judges) are ordinary </p><p>people, mortals with ordinary flesh who get drunk if they </p><p>drink at all.  So we expect them to be objective." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Then he launched into a typical diatribe against </p><p>homosexuality, apparently using the opportunity to refute </p><p>indirectly recent rumors about the sexual orientation of one </p><p>of his cabinet members.  "When I say gays are worse than dogs </p><p>and pigs, I really meant it because pigs don\'t do unnatural </p><p>things.  Let not our Parliament ever entertain that the </p><p>unnatural must be made natural. ...I cannot appreciate that a </p><p>whole Parliament can decide that Robert Mugabe and Joseph </p><p>Msika can get married.  I certainly appreciate that which is </p><p>natural.  I don\'t think the mission of human beings is to do </p><p>unnatural things." </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) In his earlier July 23 speech at the opening ceremony </p><p>of Parliament, Mugabe blamed British "machinations" and the </p><p>drought for Zimbabwe\'s economic woes.  He also criticized the </p><p>banking sector for instability and hindering growth: "The </p><p>much-anticipated agrarian-led economic revival cannot take </p><p>place for as long as our financial sector continues to be </p><p>completely unstable.  Our banking institutions have to be </p><p>shaken into realizing the harm they are doing to the economy </p><p>through rampant indiscipline.  The parallel market of our </p><p>financial, or is it money market has to be brought under </p><p>immediate control. ...a run-away exchange rate cannot be the </p><p>way to the recovery of our economy. ...We accordingly need to </p><p>cause greater production of exportables, especially our major </p><p>earners of foreign currency... ...through various export </p><p>promotion schemes, including incentives.  ...Devaluation is </p><p>thus dead!" </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) At the Parliamentary ceremony, Mugabe said Zimbabwe </p><p>would accept humanitarian aid, but he criticized </p><p>international "sinister interests" for exacerbating </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s vulnerability, and threatening its sovereignty </p><p>under cover of humanitarian involvement.  Linking food </p><p>security to land reform, he said, "as part of our effort to </p><p>find a lasting solution to food security, the implementation </p><p>of the Agrarian Reform Programme has been our highest </p><p>priority..." </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) In his July 23 remarks, Mugabe expressed delight that </p><p>a Value Added Tax (VAT) bill had been introduced in </p><p>Parliament, noting that the VAT would enable tax collection </p><p>at each stage of production.  Correspondingly, he advanced </p><p>various proposals to spend VAT revenue including an earmarked </p><p>ZWD$8.5 billion (USD$12 million) for "tillage, crop and </p><p>livestock input support to our newly resettled farmers for </p><p>the next agricultural season."  He suggested unspecified </p><p>spending for "Soldiers Engaged in Economic Development" </p><p>(SEED) to clear landmines from land to be used for </p><p>settlement, unspecified spending to build border posts at </p><p>three locations in the northwest and east frontiers of the </p><p>country, unspecified spending for a legal aid scheme, </p><p>unspecified spending for satellite schools utilizing existing </p><p>farm homesteads, sheds and barns for children of "new </p><p>farmers", and unspecified spending for HIV/Aids prevention, </p><p>counseling and testing. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Mugabe proposed to centralize under a Financial </p><p>Services Authority the existing Commissioner of Insurance, </p><p>Registrar of Banking Institutions, Registrar of Building </p><p>Societies, Registrar of Stock Exchange, Registrar of </p><p>Collective Investment Schemes, and Registrar of Pension and </p><p>Provident Funds.  In addition he proposed to amend the </p><p>education act to appoint civil servants to head every school </p><p>whether public, religious, or private, a proposal which </p><p>subsequently elicited significant criticism. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) At the Zimbabwe Nurses\' Association\'s 19th Annual </p><p>General Meeting in Chinoyi on July 27 Mugabe castigated </p><p>Britain for "coming at the dead of night to steal our people </p><p>(pharmacists, doctors and nurses)," even though "We have </p><p>created an environment that allows that upliftment of nurses." </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Mugabe\'s comments confirm that he has no intention of </p><p>veering from his current destructive path.  It is clear that </p><p>sound economic policy-making will continue to be sacrificed </p><p>on the altar of politics, so long as Mugabe remains at the </p><p>helm.  We will watch closely whether establishment of the </p><p>proposed Financial Services Authority nudges Zimbabwe ever </p><p>closer to a command economy.  Mugabe\'s public comments were </p><p>noteworthy as well for his refusal to take any responsibility </p><p>for this country\'s political and economic crises, preferring </p><p>instead to blame his favorite whipping boy, Britain. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Mugabe\'s remarks on the Judiciary on July 23 were the </p><p>first time he has explicitly vowed to ignore court rulings he </p><p>does not deem impartial or objective, although he has done so </p><p>de facto for the past three years.  His speech was </p><p>nonetheless the most compelling example to date of the GOZ\'s </p><p>contempt for basic rule of law.  We would suggest quoting </p><p>Mugabe\'s precise words as presidential affirmation that the </p><p>Mugabe Government will no longer accept the rule of law.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
