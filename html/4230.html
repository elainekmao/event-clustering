<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 007974 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/06/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, EU, TU, EU Accession </p><p>SUBJECT: EURODIPLOMATS IN ANKARA SAY TURKEY\'S EU CANDIDACY </p><p>GAINING MOMENTUM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A)ANKARA 7766 B)ANKARA 7352 C)ANKARA 6116 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: EU-member-state diplomats in Ankara say the </p><p>EU is headed toward offering Turkey a conditional date for </p><p>accession talks, possibly in January 2004.  Our contacts say </p><p>Germany holds the key; local German diplomats agree Berlin </p><p>feels under pressure not to block Turkey\'s candidacy.  UK and </p><p>Danish diplomats say their countries strongly back Turkey. </p><p>The diplomats agree their governments are willing to work </p><p>with the newly elected AK Party government, though some are </p><p>wary of AK\'s perceived Islamist roots.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>TURKEY\'S CANDIDACY GAINING MOMENTUM </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Poloff discussed the state of Turkey\'s EU candidacy </p><p>and the impact of the landslide victory of the </p><p>Islam-influenced AK Party in the November 3 national </p><p>elections (Reftel A) with German, Danish and British </p><p>diplomats November 4 and 5.  The Eurodiplomats agreed </p><p>Turkey\'s candidacy has gained momentum since the October 9 </p><p>release of EU Commission reports that did not recommend </p><p>offering Turkey a date for accession talks (Reftel B).  They </p><p>said a strong consensus is emerging in favor of offering </p><p>Turkey a date to start accession talks, on the condition that </p><p>the GOT implements further reforms.  According to our </p><p>contacts, the details will not be hammered out until shortly </p><p>before the December 12-13 EU Summit in Copenhagen, but one </p><p>scenario being widely discussed in EU circles would establish </p><p>the following steps: Turkey\'s candidacy will be reviewed </p><p>again at the December 2003 EU Summit; if Turkey at that time </p><p>meets political criteria for membership, accession talks will </p><p>begin in January 2004.  A Danish diplomat said this was the </p><p>best-case scenario, possible if there is a breakthrough on </p><p>Cyprus and a strong commitment by the new Turkish government </p><p>to the EU membership process before the December Summit.  A </p><p>weaker version of the EU offer would state that Turkey will </p><p>start accession talks at an unspecified date in 2004. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>GOT WANTS 2003 DATE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) GOT officials accept privately that the EU will attach </p><p>conditions to any date offered.  Still, they insist the EU </p><p>must mention a specific date, preferably in 2003, before 10 </p><p>new states become members in 2004.  Inan Ozyildiz, foreign </p><p>affairs advisor to the President, told Poloff the Turkish </p><p>public will not understand if countries such as Malta and </p><p>Lithuania, not to mention Cyprus, join the EU before Turkey </p><p>has even begun accession talks.  He said Turks are very </p><p>proud, and may turn their back on the EU if they feel </p><p>slighted.  Also, he said, the new members might try to block </p><p>Turkey\'s accession once they attain EU voting rights.  The </p><p>Ankara-based Eurodiplomats said they are aware of Turkish </p><p>sensitivities, but the EU members also have to worry about </p><p>their own constituencies.  By offering to start talks in </p><p>January 2004, the EU would be setting a date far enough in </p><p>the future to ease member-state anxieties about Turkey, but </p><p>early enough to show the Turks they are being treated fairly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>BERLIN FEELING THE HEAT </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to our contacts, Germany holds the key to </p><p>the December Summit.  They say  other major EU states are </p><p>either supportive of Turkey\'s candidacy or are staying on the </p><p>sidelines.  The UK appears to be Turkey\'s strongest backer -- </p><p>a British diplomat told Poloff the UK will do everything it </p><p>can to see that the EU offers Turkey a forward-leaning </p><p>conditional date.  Term president Denmark and Italy are </p><p>apparently also very supportive.  France is a mystery -- both </p><p>the GOT and diplomats from other EU states have told Emboffs </p><p>they don\'t know where Paris stands.  Most of the smaller </p><p>states are indifferent, and Greece is no longer putting up </p><p>opposition.  Two German diplomats told Poloff Berlin does not </p><p>want to be seen as the obstacle in Turkey\'s path.  "If Turkey </p><p>does not get in, they will blame us," one of them said.  They </p><p>lamented the fact that Germany, which would be most affected </p><p>by Turkish membership, is being pressured by other countries </p><p>with a much smaller stake in the matter.  They said they were </p><p>caught off guard when German FM Fischer recently made public </p><p>statements strongly supporting Turkey\'s candidacy.  The </p><p>German Embassy is usually more pro-Turkey than Berlin, and </p><p>now the positions are reversed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) A Danish diplomat told Poloff his government has </p><p>noticed a sudden change in Germany\'s approach.  At the </p><p>October 21-22 EU Foreign Ministers meeting, both Fischer and </p><p>UK FS Straw urged participants to think about Turkey as a </p><p>strategic ally in the struggle against terrorism.  The EU, </p><p>they said, needed to support Turkey to show that Islam could </p><p>co-exist with democracy and prosperity.  The Danish diplomat </p><p>noted that in the past the UK had been alone in making this </p><p>U.S.-style argument in EU meetings.  "They (the Germans) are </p><p>starting to talk like you guys," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE OF GOT REFORMS SINKS IN </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Eurodiplomats said EU support for Turkey is </p><p>increasing primarily because the significance of the GOT\'s </p><p>recent reforms has begun to sink in.  In particular, they </p><p>said, EU states were surprised by the extent of the GOT\'s </p><p>August reform package (Reftel C), which dealt with the most </p><p>sensitive issues -- such as the death penalty and Kurdish </p><p>language rights -- that the GOT had avoided in earlier reform </p><p>efforts.  Before August, EU-member governments had assumed </p><p>Turkey would be so far from meeting membership criteria that </p><p>its candidacy would not have to be seriously addressed at the </p><p>December Summit.  Now, they understand the GOT has launched a </p><p>serious reform effort that the EU must help keep on track. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>EU WILLING TO WORK WITH AK </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) It is not yet clear how the electoral triumph of the </p><p>Islam-influenced AK party will affect this process.  The </p><p>Eurodiplomats said their governments were determined to give </p><p>AK the benefit of the doubt, given the party\'s pro-EU stance </p><p>during the campaign.  Still, there are anxieties below the </p><p>surface in some EU capitals about AK\'s perceived Islamist </p><p>roots, according to our contacts.  The German diplomats said </p><p>AK\'s rise to power is "not a boost" to Turkey\'s candidacy, as </p><p>it will heighten fears among the German public about taking </p><p>in a large, Muslim country as an EU member. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
