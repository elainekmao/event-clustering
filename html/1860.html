(U) CARDINAL ROGER ETCHEGARAY, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE AND MEMBER OF THE </p><p>U.N.\'S "EMINENT PERSONS" GROUP OF ADVISORS, SAID THE WCAR </p><p>MUST BE AWARE OF THE MODERN MANIFESTATIONS OF INEQUALITY. </p><p>FOLLOWING THE ROUND TABLE TALKS AT THE GENEVA OFFICES OF THE </p><p>UNHCR, THE CARDINAL STATED THAT "THE ANTIRACISM OF YESTERDAY </p><p>SEEMS UNSUITED TODAY AND NEEDS NOT ONLY TO REVIVE ITS </p><p>PERMANENT CONVICTIONS BUT ALSO TO RENEW ITS REASONING, EVEN </p><p>SOMETIMES TO CHANGE ITS TARGET."  HE WARNED THAT NEW </p><p>PERMUTATIONS OF RACISM MIGHT BEST BE FOUGHT BY NEW METHODS. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) POLOFF AND POL INTERN MET AUGUST 2 WITH KISHORE </p><p>JAYABALAN, ASSISTANT TO FRANK DEWANE, UNDERSECRETARY OF THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE, TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS ON THE WORLD CONFERENCE ON RACISM.  (NOTE: </p><p>DEWANE WAS THE VATICAN REPRESENTATIVE AT 1ST WEEK SESSION OF </p><p>WCAR IN GENEVA).  THE HOLY SEE GENERALLY SHARES USG </p><p>POSITIONS ON CONTROVERSIAL AREAS OF THE WCAR DOCUMENTS, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY, ZIONISM AS RACISM </p><p>LANGUAGE, AND "ISLAMAPHOBIA." </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) LIKE THE USG, THE HOLY SEE WOULD PREFER THE WCAR </p><p>TO BE A FORWARD LOOKING CONFERENCE, FOCUSING MORE ON </p><p>CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS THAN APOLOGIES FOR WRONGS COMMITTED </p><p>GENERATIONS AGO.  THEY WOULD RATHER DISCUSS MODERN </p><p>TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS THAN REPARATIONS FOR THE SLAVE </p><p>TRADE FROM AFRICA - ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS IGNORES ALL OTHER </p><p>SLAVE TRADES, PAST AND PRESENT.  IN ADDITION, THE VATICAN </p><p>HAD RESERVATIONS ON THE PARAGRAPHS DEALING WITH THE </p><p>HOLOCAUST.  JAYABALAN DID SAY THAT THIS WAS A MORE TIMELY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04202  091340Z </p><p>AND RELEVANT ISSUE THAN SLAVERY REPARATIONS, AS THERE ARE </p><p>LIVING HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) ACCORDING TO JAYABALAN, THE HOLY SEE ALSO </p><p>OBJECTED TO THE `ZIONISM AS RACISM\' LANGUAGE.  CITING THE </p><p>EXAMPLES OF NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE BALKANS, HE SAID THEY </p><p>VIEW RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION AS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM </p><p>DISCRIMINATION BASED ON ETHNICITY OR RACE, ALTHOUGH NO LESS </p><p>GRIEVOUS AN OFFENSE.  A RELIGION IS A CHOICE OR A SYSTEM OF </p><p>BELIEFS, NOT AN INHERITED TRAIT. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (SBU) MR. JAYABALAN THOUGHT THE WCAR DOCUMENTS LACKED A </p><p>CLEAR AND CURRENT FOCUS.  HE SAW THEM AS OVERLOADED WITH </p><p>INDIVIDUAL PET PROJECTS, WITH NO CLEAR FOCUS OR GOAL FOR THE </p><p>CONFERENCE AS A WHOLE.  JAYABALAN BELIEVED THAT THESE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL ISSUES, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD </p><p>NOT MAKE IT PAST THE PREPCON. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (SBU) COMMENT: WHILE THE HOLY SEE MAY SHARE USG VIEWS </p><p>ON MANY OF THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF THE WCAR, THEY TEND TO </p><p>LIMIT ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN DEBATES TO TOPICS OF PARAMOUNT </p><p>IMPORTANCE TO THE VATICAN, SUCH AS ABORTION.  THEY CAN, </p><p>HOWEVER, BE A USEFUL PARTNER BEHIND THE SCENES, ESPECIALLY </p><p>WITH COUNTRIES (E.G. LIBYA, IRAQ) WITH WHICH THE USG HAS </p><p>LITTLE LEVERAGE.  END COMMENT.
