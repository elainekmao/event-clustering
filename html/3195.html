THE G-77 INITIALLY SOUGHT TO STIPULATE A FIXED </p><p>PERCENTAGE (20 PERCENT) TO BE ALLOCATED TO AGRICULTURE </p><p>FROM ODA.

THE EU AND NORWAY INITIALLY RESISTED U.S.-PROPOSED </p><p>LANGUAGE ON BIOTECHNOLOGY WHICH URGED THE FAO TO ADVANCE </p><p>RESEARCH INTO NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING BIOTECHNOLOGY. </p><p>DESPITE THE FACT THAT NEGOTIATED WORDING (DRAWN LARGELY </p><p>FROM THE 2001 G-8 SUMMIT) FINALLY MET WITH BROAD </p><p>ACCEPTANCE, NORWAY ATTEMPTED AT THE LAST MINUTE TO INSERT </p><p>A REFERENCE TO THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE UNLESS THE </p><p>UNITED STATES WOULD ACCEPT THE RIGHT TO FOOD CODE OF </p><p>CONDUCT.  THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF THE CHAIR, THE EU </p><p>(WHICH DID NOT SUPPORT A CODE) AND THE U.S. PREVAILED </p><p>OVER NORWAY AND THE BIOTECHNOLOGY LANGUAGE WENT FORWARD </p><p>WITHOUT A REFERENCE TO THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE. </p><p> </p><p>CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>9.

THE </p><p>EU PROPOSED "VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES" TO BE NEGOTIATED UNDER </p><p>THE AUSPICES OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p>THE NORWEGIANS PROPOSED NEGOTIATION OF A "CODE OF </p><p>CONDUCT" AT THE SAME VENUE.  THE LATIN AMERICAN GROUP </p><p>SUPPORTED NEGOTIATION OF A "CODE OF CONDUCT," BUT UNDER </p><p>FAO AUSPICES.  THE U.S. QUESTIONED WHETHER THE PROPOSED </p><p>PRODUCT - BE IT A CODE OF CONDUCT OR VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES </p><p>-- WAS A MEANINGFUL WAY TO IMPROVE FOOD SECURITY AND </p><p>REITERATED ITS POSITION THAT THE RIGHT TO FOOD SHOULD BE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RIGHT TO A STANDARD OF </p><p>LIVING ADEQUATE TO HEALTH AND WELL BEING, AS SET FORTH IN </p><p>THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>10.

THE FINAL DECLARATION </p><p>REQUESTS THE FAO COUNCIL TO CREATE AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL </p><p>GROUP TO "ELABORATE, IN A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS, A SET OF </p><p>VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES TO SUPPORT MEMBER STATES\' EFFORTS TO </p><p>ACHIEVE THE PROGRESSIVE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO </p><p>ADEQUATE FOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY." </p><p>IN ADDITION TO THE SUBSTITUTION OF VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES </p><p>FOR CODE OF CONDUCT, THE FOCUS OF THE GUIDELINES WILL </p><p>APPROPRIATELY BE ON NATIONAL (RATHER THAN INTERNATIONAL) </p><p>ACTION. IN ADDITION, USDEL WAS ALSO SUCCESSFUL IN WALKING </p><p>BACK THE PREAMBULAR LANGUAGE ON RIGHT TO FOOD TO READ </p><p>"RIGHT TO ACCESS TO FOOD." THE U.S. ANNOUNCED AT THE </p><p>CONCLUDING CFS PLENARY SESSION THAT IT WOULD SUBMIT A </p><p>RESERVATION TO THE DECLARATION IN CONNECTION WITH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03093  02 OF 05  241459Z </p><p>OPERATIVE PARA 10 ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD AND STATED THAT </p><p>THE  UNITED STATES DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ELABORATION </p><p>OF SUCH GUIDELINES WOULD BE USEFUL IN REDUCING THE NUMBER </p><p>OF HUNGRY OR IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>TRADE </p><p>----- </p><p>11.

THE EU (FRANCE IN PARTICULAR) AND </p><p>JAPAN STRONGLY OBJECTED TO ANY REFERENCE TO "AGRICULTURAL </p><p>TRADE" IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ROLE OF TRADE IN PROMOTING </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ALLEVIATING POVERTY.
