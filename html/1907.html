<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002116 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF/W, AF/RA AND PM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/2011 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, MARR, KPKO, PINR, PREL, NI, SL </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED ON OFR AND SECURITY </p><p>ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 2072 </p><p>     B. STATE 143583 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 2113 </p><p>     D. ABUJA 2115 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by PolMilOff, called on </p><p>NSA Aliyu Mohammed on August 22.  LTC Idris, the NSA\'s </p><p>Military Advisor also attended.  In addition to a discussion </p><p>of GON efforts in a number of African hot-spots, the WCAR and </p><p>counter-narcotics (septels), the Ambassador and NSA also </p><p>discussed security assistance and the UNAMSIL troop rotations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador Jeter informed the National Security </p><p>Advisor of the Embassy\'s efforts to improve the security </p><p>assistance relationship with the Ministry of Defense (Ref A), </p><p>and noted the positive efforts of Minister of State </p><p>Batagarawa to that end.  He also emphasized that one of the </p><p>LOAs, the amended LOA for MPRI, had to be signed within days </p><p>or MPRI would leave Nigeria on September 8.  The NSA </p><p>requested the Ambassador continue to work with Minister of </p><p>Defense Danjuma and Army Minister Batagarawa on these issues. </p><p> However, he said he would also discuss them with Batagarawa </p><p>after the Council of State meeting that afternoon.  (NOTE: </p><p>Acting Defense Minister Batagarawa, a close associate of the </p><p>NSA, called the Ambassador later that afternoon, and said he </p><p>had directed Nigeria\'s DATT in Washington, Group Captain John </p><p>Ode, to sign the amended LOA.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador Jeter then addressed the desired UNAMSIL </p><p>troop rotation schedule, which would allow for the three OFR </p><p>Phase III Battalions to rotate into UNAMSIL as a group in </p><p>January immediately after the completion of the program (Ref </p><p>B).  The NSA took note of the request, but again asked that </p><p>the Ambassador make the request to the Minister of Defense. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT: Embassy finds Aliyu Mohammed\'s continued </p><p>careful distancing from defense issues interesting.  The NSA </p><p>is willing to listen, and seems willing to work in the </p><p>background to make things happen, but is always careful to </p><p>deflect discussion of security assistance issues to Minister </p><p>Danjuma.  This is most likely due to the close relationship </p><p>shared by the President and his Defense Minister; it is also </p><p>due, however, to sustained GON efforts, beginning with the </p><p>President, to protect Danjuma\'s position and stature, despite </p><p>the Minister\'s continuing bouts with illness.  Nonetheless, </p><p>Batagarawa\'s presence, and his close relationship with the </p><p>NSA, seem to have created a back-channel for the NSA into the </p><p>Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) COMMENT CONTINUED:  Ambassador will raise the rotation </p><p>issue with the Acting Minister of Defense at the earliest </p><p>opportunity.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Freetown Minimize Considered. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
