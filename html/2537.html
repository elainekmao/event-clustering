(SBU)  Interviews with several Maoist child recruits at </p><p>the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) division in the southwestern city </p><p>of Nepalgunj indicate force, fear, and physical assault, </p><p>rather than ideology, as their primary reasons for joining. </p><p>At least two girls interviewed reported sexual abuse during </p><p>their time as Maoist militia.  We expect such forced </p><p>recruitment to increase as security forces continue to detain </p><p>more suspects during the state of emergency--thereby </p><p>depleting the Maoist militia further.  Government policy </p><p>regarding "soft-core" members of the Maoist militia, </p><p>including those who are under aged, remains unclear.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>MAIOST RECRUITERS MAKE HOUSE CALLS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  During a Feb. 22-24 visit to the Royal Nepal Army </p><p>(RNA) division in the southwestern city of Nepalgunj, </p><p>Ambassador Malinowski, accompanied by former U.S. Ambassador </p><p>to Sri Lanka Peter Burleigh, who is a Nepali speaker, and </p><p>DATT, met and interviewed several child recruits of the </p><p>Maoists who had either surrendered or been captured and were </p><p>temporarily being held in RNA custody.  Their accounts of how </p><p>they joined the Maoists reveal that the insurgents use </p><p>intimidation and force to enlist young Nepalis as porters, </p><p>cooks, and in other support positions.  None of the young </p><p>people interviewed seemed familiar with Maoist ideology, and </p><p>each cited the use of force, rather than political beliefs, </p><p>as their reasons for joining.  Some, however, reported having </p><p>been promised a house or other material goods after the </p><p>revolution.  None of the detainees interviewed could confirm </p><p>meeting any foreign cadre during their time in the field, </p><p>which, in some cases, spanned more than a year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  For most of the recruits, their career as Maoists </p><p>began with a knock on the door of their homes in the middle </p><p>of the night.  Two girls (ages 14 and 12) reported that </p><p>Maoists had come to their villages in Dang about six months </p><p>ago and had gone door to door, demanding that each family </p><p>give up one member to serve the insurgency.  Fearing </p><p>reprisals, the girls\' families offered up their daughters. </p><p>The girls worked as porters, carrying supplies for the </p><p>insurgents as they moved from place to place, but both </p><p>reported having been raped--sometimes repeatedly--on a </p><p>nightly basis by the cadre.  The 14-year-old is reportedly </p><p>pregnant.  A 17-year-old girl, who had a local reputation as </p><p>a good singer, was dragooned into service as a performer for </p><p>Maoist cultural programs that are staged in remote, rural </p><p>locations.  She said she had been with the Maoists about a </p><p>year and a half.  A 16-year-old boy, originally forced to </p><p>enlist as a porter and cook, said the cadre eventually gave </p><p>him some military training and began to use his services as a </p><p>fighter as well.  The boy said he complied because he had no </p><p>choice in the matter.  Another young man, described as a </p><p>sub-commander, had received weapons training at a Maoist base </p><p>in Nepal.  Since his capture, the teen-ager has been going </p><p>out on patrol with the RNA.  The detainess described their </p><p>respective home villages as poor and remote.  One girl, who </p><p>said there is no school within walking distance to her home, </p><p>has never been inside a classroom in her life. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>FOR THE WANT OF SOME BENCHES, </p><p>A MAOIST WAS MADE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  In at least one case, however, obtuse local </p><p>officials appear to have inadvertently benefited Maoist </p><p>recruitment efforts.  One teen-aged boy said that as a </p><p>student, he once asked local authorities why no benches were </p><p>available for the village school.  The authorities, sensing </p><p>radical sympathies in his query, immediately branded him a </p><p>Maoist.  His protests to the contrary--that all he really </p><p>wanted was some benches--were to no avail.  Shortly </p><p>thereafter, real Maoists came to his house, and, noting the </p><p>cloud of local and apparently inexpungeable suspicion he had </p><p>fallen under, observed he might as well come with them.  Once </p><p>again, his protests to the contrary--that all he really </p><p>wanted was some benches--proved fruitless and he was forced </p><p>to join his putative comrades. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  The young detainees had been held at the RNA </p><p>barracks in Nepalgunj for approximately 10 days.  Before </p><p>that, they had been held at a brigade barracks in Rolpa for </p><p>varying lengths of time.  At Nepalgunj, they are being held </p><p>in barracks rooms, not cells, and said they were being given </p><p>adequate medical treatment.  (The girls who had reported </p><p>sexual abuse have apparently not been checked for signs of </p><p>sexually transmitted diseases.  End note.)  None of the </p><p>detainees interviewed reported any abuse during their time in </p><p>RNA custody.  At meal time, the Ambassador observed the teens </p><p>eating the same rations given to the soldiers.  Division </p><p>Commander Maj. Gen. Sadip Shah said that a local committee, </p><p>made up of representatives of the military, police, and civil </p><p>authority, confers on the case of each suspected Maoist </p><p>brought to the RNA barracks to decide whether sufficient </p><p>evidence exists to keep the individual in custody.  Those </p><p>deemed suspicious enough to continue to hold are turned over </p><p>to the civilian police.  (Note:  Under the state of </p><p>emergency, suspects may held up to 90 days without charges. </p><p>End note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)   Each of the young detainees interviewed said that </p><p>if released, they do not intend to return to their villages </p><p>because of fear of reprisals from neighbors.  On the other </p><p>hand, none seemed to have a clear idea of what to do instead, </p><p>or to harbor much hope for the future.  A 19-year-old captive </p><p>said that his wife is due to deliver a baby in April.  When </p><p>asked if the military might bring his wife and new baby to </p><p>him, the young man answered that he wants no one to know that </p><p>he is in government custody or even alive.  If the Maoists </p><p>learn he is in custody, they will believe him a traitor, </p><p>placing both the lives of his wife and baby in jeopardy. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  No one, probably including the RNA, has a good </p><p>idea of how many "hard-core" Maoist cadre have taken up arms </p><p>against the government, nor how many support militia, like </p><p>the unfortunate children in Nepalgunj, have been pressed into </p><p>service against their will.  As the state of emergency </p><p>continues and Government of Nepal (GON) security forces make </p><p>more arrests, further depleting the ranks of the Maoists\' </p><p>cooks and porters, we expect the volume of forced </p><p>recruitments to climb.  Each of the children said they had </p><p>joined the Maoists because they felt they had no other </p><p>alternative.  Now that they are out of Maoist hands, they </p><p>still seem to have the same feeling of hopelessness.  Their </p><p>unwillingness to return to their homes and families indicates </p><p>just how bleakly they regard their own futures--and how </p><p>vulnerable they may remain to possible "re-recruitment" </p><p>efforts if released.  GON policy regarding "soft-core" Maoist </p><p>recruits--especially those under age or who have </p><p>surrendered--remains unclear.  Desepite our repeated queries, </p><p>we have heard no discussion from the GON of prospective </p><p>rehabilitation or amnesty programs for former Maoist militia </p><p>or cadre.  Such a lack of planning seems short-sighted if the </p><p>GON\'s ultimate goal is to persuade the Maoists to lay down </p><p>their arms.  But when the Maoists in question are children </p><p>conscripted by force, that lack of planning threatens to </p><p>perpetuate the same cycle of hopelessness, circumscribed </p><p>opportunity, and poverty that made those children likely </p><p>recruits in the first place.  End comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
