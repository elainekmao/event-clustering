(U) REFTELS (A) AND (B) REQUESTED POST\'S RESPONSE TO </p><p>QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO CHILD LABOR PRACTICES IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE. THIS CABLE, IN CONJUNCTION WITH REFTELS (C) </p><p>AND (D) FROM OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 1999, DISCUSSES </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN CHILD LABOR PRACTICES IN DETAIL AND PROVIDE </p><p>ANSWERS TO DEPARTMENT\'S QUESTIONS. REFTELS (C) AND (D) </p><p>PRESENTED EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF REMOVING ZIMBABWE FROM </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT\'S LIST OF COUNTRIES THAT PRODUCE GOODS </p><p>THROUGH FORCED CHILD LABOR. THE FACTS AND ARGUMENTS </p><p>PRESENTED IN THOSE MESSAGES REMAIN VALID TODAY, I.E., </p><p>CHILD LABOR IS VERY COMMON IN ZIMBABWE (PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>THE COMMUNAL AND COMMERCIAL FARMING SECTORS), BUT </p><p>"FORCED CHILD LABOR" AND "WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR" AS </p><p>DEFINED BY THE ILO ARE NOT COMMON OCCURRENCES. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) TO RESPOND TO THE REMAINDER OF DEPARTMENT\'S </p><p>QUESTIONS IN REFTELS (A) AND (B), ZIMBABWE IS A </p><p>SIGNATORY TO BOTH THE ILO\'S INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM ON THE </p><p>ELIMINATION OF CHILD LABOR (IPEC), AND ILO CONVENTION </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03348  01 OF 02  210915Z </p><p>182 ON THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR. TWO PIECES OF </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN LEGISLATION PROHIBIT CHILD LABOR: (1) THE </p><p>LABOR RELATIONS ACT (LRA), CHAPTER 28, STATUTORY </p><p>INSTRUMENT 72, WHICH SETS THE MINIMUM AGE OF EMPLOYMENT </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE AT 16; AND (2) THE CHILD ADOPTION AND </p><p>PROTECTION ACT, WHICH INCORPORATES ILO CONVENTION 182 </p><p>AND PROHIBITS "WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) DESPITE THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS, THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE HAS DONE LITTLE IN RECENT YEARS TO STOP THE </p><p>PRACTICE OF CHILD LABOR, WHICH OCCURS FREQUENTLY ON </p><p>FARMS (BOTH SMALL-SCALE AND COMMERCIAL) AND IN CITIES </p><p>WHERE CHILDREN OFTEN WORK AS DOMESTIC SERVANTS OR IN THE </p><p>INFORMAL TRADING SECTOR. AS MORE ADULT ZIMBABWEANS ARE </p><p>LOST TO HIV/AIDS (AN ESTIMATED 25 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S ADULT POPULATION IS HIV-POSITIVE), THE PROBLEM </p><p>OF CHILD LABOR IS GROWING, AS CIRCUMSTANCES FORCE MORE </p><p>CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL AND INTO JOBS TO SUPPORT </p><p>THEMSELVES AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. THE ILO FUNDED A </p><p>STUDY IN LATE 1999 BY THE GOZ\'S CENTRAL STATISTICAL </p><p>OFFICE ON CHILD LABOR PRACTICES. THE GOZ SENT ITS </p><p>PRELIMINARY RESULTS TO GENEVA FOR COMMENT AND, ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE ILO OFFICE IN HARARE, INTENDS TO HOLD A WORKSHOP </p><p>TO RELEASE THE OFFICIAL RESULTS IN AUGUST 2000. (THE GOZ </p><p>AND ILO DECLINED TO MAKE A COPY OF THE PRELIMINARY </p><p>REPORT AVAILABLE TO THE EMBASSY PRIOR TO ITS OFFICIAL </p><p>RELEASE.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) IN A JUNE 19 CONVERSATION WITH LABOFF, MS. NELLY </p><p>DHLEMBEU, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL WELFARE AT THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SERVICE, LABOR, AND SOCIAL WELFARE, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03348  01 OF 02  210915Z </p><p>COULD NOT IDENTIFY ANY SPECIFIC GOZ PROGRAMS CURRENTLY </p><p>IN OPERATION THAT PROMOTE BETTER ACCESS TO PRIMARY </p><p>SCHOOLING. AS MS. DHLEMBEU EXPLAINED, THE GOZ\'S </p><p>EDUCATION AND SOCIAL WELFARE BUDGETS ARE ALREADY </p><p>STRETCHED TOO THIN. THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT AFFORD TO HIRE </p><p>ENOUGH TEACHERS TO FILL DEMANDING POSITIONS IN PRIMARY </p><p>AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN REMOTE RURAL AREAS (A </p><p>CONTINUOUS PROBLEM FOR THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION). THE </p><p>GOZ OFTEN LACKS FUNDS TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF </p><p>PUBLIC SCHOOLS (PARTICULARLY IN THE RURAL AREAS), MANY </p><p>OF WHICH SUFFER FROM A LACK OF WATER, ELECTRICITY, </p><p>BOOKS, SCHOOL SUPPLIES, AND OTHER BASIC NEEDS. AS A </p><p>RESULT, SAID DHLEMBEU, THE GOZ HAS LITTLE LEFT TO FUND </p><p>ADDITIONAL CHILDREN\'S EDUCATION PROGRAMS. (COMMENT: </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY HAS BEEN IN A TAILSPIN SINCE 1998 AND </p><p>CONTINUES TO WORSEN. THE GOZ IS OPERATING ON A </p><p>SHOESTRING, WITH ALL BUT ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS </p><p>ON HOLD INDEFINITELY. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE ANY GOZ </p><p>FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL CHILDREN\'S EDUCATION OR CHILD </p><p>LABOR PROGRAMS ANY TIME SOON, UNLESS THE ILO IS THE SOLE </p><p>CONTRIBUTOR. END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) SEVERAL NGOS CONTINUE THEIR WORK TO PROMOTE </p><p>BETTER ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND STEER FAMILIES AWAY FROM </p><p>CHILD LABOR, BUT THEIR BUDGETS ARE MEAGER AND THEIR </p><p>SUCCESS LIMITED, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT CHILD </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2799 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03348  02 OF 02  210915Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EAP-00   EB-00    ED-01 </p><p>      EXME-00  EUR-00   E-00     UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01 </p><p>      H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SA-00    PRM-01   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     SAS-00     /016W </p><p>                  ------------------65349E  210915Z /38 </p><p>R 210920Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6358 </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>INFO CHILD LABOR COLLECTIVE </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003348 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/EPS FOR TONY HOLMES </p><p> </p><p>EB/TPP/BTA FOR VLAD SAMBAIEW </p><p> </p><p>DRL/IL FOR CHRIS CAMILLO </p><p> </p><p>DOL/ILAB FOR MAUREEN JAFFE AND MARCIA EUGENIO </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03348  02 OF 02  210915Z </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR OAA AND TD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EIND, ETRD, PHUM, SOCI, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: CHILD LABOR IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>LABOR IN ZIMBABWE IS A LONGSTANDING, WIDELY ACCEPTED </p><p>OCCURRENCE.
