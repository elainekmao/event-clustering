<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 002501 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>STATE PASS TO USDA FAS </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4212/ITA/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, EAIR, ELTN, ETRD, IT, SENV, TBIO, TSPA, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: USEU VISIT: ITALY\'S MANAGEMENT OF ECONOMIC ISSUES </p><p>DURING ITS EU PRESIDENCY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Economic Minister Counselor Scott Kilner for Reasons 1.5 </p><p> (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary. In the interest of repairing U.S.-EU </p><p>relations during its upcoming EU presidency, the GOI plans to </p><p>manage existing U.S.-EU trade disputes as well as the ongoing </p><p>WTO trade talks in a way that will emphasize the positive. </p><p>Pro-biotech elements within the GOI express hope that EU </p><p>Parliamentary approval of traceability and labeling rules </p><p>will dampen anti-biotech Agricultural Minister Alemanno\'s </p><p>influence on the issue; some GOI officials speculate the U.S. </p><p>request for WTO consultations over the EU moratorium on </p><p>approvals may finally push the GOI to adopt a unified biotech </p><p>policy. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The GOI is cautiously optimistic on prospects for </p><p>the Doha trade round, especially if CAP reform spurs forward </p><p>movement on the agricultural side of the talks. A solution to </p><p>the TRIPS/Access to Medicine issue is seen as essential for </p><p>the Cancun ministerial to avoid being termed a failure. </p><p>Italy will use its EU presidency to push greater protection </p><p>under the WTO for geographic indications.  However, the GOI </p><p>appears inclined to defer extensively to the European </p><p>Commission on most other aspects of the Doha agenda, </p><p>including preparations for the September WTO Ministerial </p><p>Conference in Cancun.  FSC, steel, and the EU chemical policy </p><p>will all require particular attention.  The GOI supports a </p><p>greater industry role in the formulation of the chemicals </p><p>policy. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Italy plans to hold a joint meeting of EU </p><p>Environment and Energy Ministers, as part of its strategy to </p><p>"introduce more economics into EU environmental policy." </p><p>Carbon sequestration and the hydrogen economy are also high </p><p>on the Italian agenda.  Key transport priorities are </p><p>financing infrastructure and Galileo.  While responsibility </p><p>for Galileo within the EU is divided among the telecoms, </p><p>transport and research councils, the GOI expects the M-code </p><p>decision to go to the European Council.  In Italy, the </p><p>Ministry of Research has the lead, but final decisions on </p><p>Galileo are expected to be made by the Prime Minister.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) USEU Economic Minister Counselor Anne Derse and Trade </p><p>Policy Attache Christopher Wilson visited Rome May 27-28 to </p><p>preview with the GOI and Embassy staff trade, economic and </p><p>environmental issues that will be active during Italy\'s </p><p>upcoming EU presidency.  Derse and Wilson, accompanied by </p><p>Embassy econ officers, met with officials at the Foreign </p><p>Trade Office of the Ministry of Productive Activities, as </p><p>well as the Ministries of Environment, Finance, Foreign </p><p>Affairs, and Transport.  A session with Ambassador Nicholson </p><p>and his staff at the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See was a </p><p>useful exchange on further engaging the Vatican to play a </p><p>constructive role in the continuing debate over the use of </p><p>agricultural biotech, particularly in the developing world. </p><p>Agricultural Biotech </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Federico Eichberg, senior advisor to Foreign Trade </p><p>Vice Minister Adolfo Urso, openly lamented the continued lack </p><p>of a coherent GOI position on agricultural biotech. The </p><p>Foreign Trade/Ministry of Productive Activities, along with </p><p>the Ministries of Health and Environment, generally shared </p><p>U.S. views on biotech products, but anti-biotech Agriculture </p><p>Minister Alemanno continued to exert significant influence </p><p>within the GOI.  Eichberg expressed the hope that the </p><p>pro-biotech ministries will gain influence once new </p><p>traceability and labeling rules are approved by the European </p><p>Parliament, perhaps by November.  While noting that the EU </p><p>moratorium on biotech approvals (and the GOI,s Amato decree </p><p>that banned four varieties of U.S. corn in 2000) is a </p><p>separate issue from the implementation of new traceability </p><p>and labeling rules, Eichberg was hopeful a mutual resolution </p><p>could be realized.  Wilson responded that continuing movement </p><p>towards resuming the EU approvals process will be helpful as </p><p>the WTO process moves forward in the next few months, but he </p><p>cautioned against the imposition of additional conditions by </p><p>some member states in exchange for lifting the moratorium. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Environment Ministry International Affairs Director </p><p>General Corrado Clini viewed the U.S. request for </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>consultations as a positive step in that it will pressure the </p><p>EU towards resolution. He also believed the GOI might finally </p><p>be pushed towards a unified policy, implying that Alemanno </p><p>would no longer dominate the issue within the government.  He </p><p>views France and Austria as the most intransigent foes of </p><p>biotech, and that French opposition is a purely protectionist </p><p>policy to keep U.S. imports from harming French agricultural </p><p>interests (unlike Italy, where significant public opposition </p><p>to GMOs drove the policy of officials like Alemanno). Clini </p><p>believed the prospective conciliation process for the </p><p>implementation of new traceability and labeling rules has </p><p>been made more difficult by the U.S. consultations request. </p><p>Massimo Gaiani, of the MFA,s European Integration Bureau, </p><p>told us that the GOI awaited the results of the EU </p><p>Parliament,s second reading on new traceability and labeling </p><p>rules, and is concerned that amendments to the legislation </p><p>are extremist and not in line with the EC common position. </p><p>He also noted concern that lack of progress in WTO </p><p>consultations this summer could encourage the adoption of </p><p>such amendments, further complicating the (potential) </p><p>conciliation process.  Gaiani added that he believes the </p><p>European Commission will continue to defend the common </p><p>position. Derse responded that the U.S. continued to have </p><p>concerns about the EC common position itself, not to mention </p><p>some of the more extremist amendments that have been put </p><p>forward by the EU Parliament. Gaiani echoed Clini and </p><p>Eichberg in noting that pressure on the EU to resolve the </p><p>biotech issue, particularly during the course of the Italian </p><p>presidency, could spur creation of a common GOI position. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador to the Holy See James Nicholson told Derse </p><p>and Wilson that the Vatican was moving closer to U.S. views </p><p>on biotech, though he noted that opinions varied among </p><p>Vatican officials and local bishops.  There is widespread </p><p>belief that the EU,s concerns are largely politically based, </p><p>rather than motivated by health or environmental concerns. </p><p>The Vatican\'s Pontifical Council had found no reason not to </p><p>use biotech foods and, though calling for adequate </p><p>precautions, they do appear to be on the right side of the </p><p>issue from a scientific standpoint.  Ambassador Nicholson </p><p>noted an upcoming visit of an African cardinal that could </p><p>usefully link economic development in Africa with greater </p><p>acceptance of agricultural biotech products. </p><p> </p><p>WTO/Doha Round and Cancun Ministerial </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Eichberg conveyed GOI concern that the September </p><p>Cancun ministerial not be overloaded with issues to resolve. </p><p>He said the recent positive movements toward CAP reform were </p><p>welcomed by the GOI (including Alemanno) and there was hope </p><p>that subsequent agricultural market access talks would be </p><p>more fruitful.  He also thought positive movement on </p><p>non-agricultural market access (NAMA) might help the </p><p>agricultural talks. Wilson noted that the U.S. viewed CAP </p><p>reform as a positive step, though there were significant </p><p>market access issues remaining to be resolved.  We would miss </p><p>the end-May deadline on a modalities paper for NAMA, but the </p><p>U.S. was not pessimistic about making further progress in </p><p>those talks.  Eichberg noted that the GOI was not overly </p><p>concerned about deadlines. He was optimistic the 2005 </p><p>deadline for concluding the round was possible, but we should </p><p>not be concerned if it slips some. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) On TRIPS/Medicine (an issue of particular concern to </p><p>Vice Minister Urso) Eichberg expressed some confidence that </p><p>resolution was attainable, he hoped before Cancun.  He </p><p>suggested that announcement of such a resolution during the </p><p>Cancun meeting would generate positive coverage and dampen </p><p>"no-global" sentiment.  Wilson agreed that resolution of the </p><p>issue before Cancun would be necessary to keep it from </p><p>dominating the meeting, and he was hopeful that the G-8 </p><p>summit would create an environment that would facilitate </p><p>resolution. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Increased protection of geographic indications </p><p>within the WTO remains a key GOI concern, and Eichberg said </p><p>that the issue will be prominent on the trade agenda during </p><p>Italy,s presidency. Eichberg noted that such concern is </p><p>based on the notion of providing consumers with greater </p><p>knowledge about, and access to, quality products, and on </p><p>protecting the many small producers of such products through </p><p>a system that would not entail the burdensome costs of </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>registering and enforcing trademarks.  Eichberg told us the </p><p>GOI has discussed with the EC a possible strategy of imposing </p><p>a limit on the number of GIs for wines and spirits in </p><p>exchange for full market access and reciprocity for other </p><p>GIs.  He also suggested linking GI protection with different </p><p>forms of protection, such as trademarks. Italy would also </p><p>provide technical assistance to developing countries to </p><p>enable them to provide greater protection of GIs.  Wilson </p><p>cautioned that the U.S. and EU positions on GIs remained far </p><p>apart (and Cairns Group members were perhaps even further </p><p>from the EU position). </p><p> </p><p>U.S.-EU Bilateral Trade Issues </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) In the interest of bringing Transatlantic relations </p><p>back on track, the Foreign Ministry,s Gaiani told us the GOI </p><p>will work to prevent both the creation of new trade disputes </p><p>and the worsening of existing disputes.  In addition to </p><p>biotech, he pointed to steel and FSC as two areas of </p><p>particular concern. Wilson noted that a decision by the WTO </p><p>on the U.S. appeal to the earlier WTO decision on the U.S. </p><p>steel safeguards, along with the U.S. mid-term review of the </p><p>safeguards, would both take place in the fall. He did not </p><p>want to assume the outcome in either case, and added that the </p><p>U.S. was pleased at the progress on steel capacity talks at </p><p>the OECD.  On FSC, Gaiani suggested that we keep in close </p><p>touch on the progress of remedial legislation in Congress. He </p><p>cautioned the EU may have little maneuvering room in the </p><p>implementation of retaliatory measures absent clear progress </p><p>in Congress. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Derse mentioned to Gaiani and Eichberg the U.S. </p><p>interest in revitalizing the Transatlantic Business Dialogue. </p><p>One impediment was finding leading EU companies willing to </p><p>play an active role in the TABD. Gaiani said he has been in </p><p>touch with the Italian business confederation Confindustria </p><p>about this problem, and the Italian Embassy in Washington was </p><p>also working on identifying and encouraging potential </p><p>companies. </p><p> </p><p>Environmental Issues </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) Clini noted that the Italian Presidency hopes to </p><p>introduce "more economics into EU environmental policy".  He </p><p>added that Italy plans to hold a joint meeting of EU </p><p>environment and energy ministers during its presidency.  He </p><p>also told us a successful COP-9 meeting in Milan is a key GOI </p><p>environmental priority during its EU presidency.  He noted </p><p>the GOI was also very interested in the upcoming Carbon </p><p>Sequestration Leadership Forum (he will not attend, but hopes </p><p>a deputy from his ministry will be able to do so). He </p><p>expressed some doubts about the benefits of carbon </p><p>sequestration in Italy, given the dominance of small and </p><p>medium enterprises.  Derse suggested hydrogen economy as </p><p>another area where EU-U.S. cooperation could yield useful </p><p>results much faster than if either worked alone.  Clini noted </p><p>that a debate was reopening within the EU regarding the </p><p>extent to which the EU should rely internally on flexible </p><p>mechanisms or solely domestic actions.  In his view, the </p><p>Germans and Swedes favored mainly domestic action, while </p><p>others are advocating more flexible mechanisms. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Clini said the ongoing EU effort on formulating a </p><p>new chemicals policy should be jointly managed by the EU </p><p>Competitiveness Council and the EU Environmental Council. </p><p>Derse said the U.S. would welcome such a development, given </p><p>the Competitiveness Council,s attention to economic </p><p>concerns.  She noted the U.S. was carefully considering the </p><p>current EU chemicals proposal and would be submitting </p><p>comments to the EU.  Clini suggested that the U.S. consider a </p><p>strategy to manage the chemicals regulation through the </p><p>Italian Presidency.  In his view, the Commission should not </p><p>only be seeking comments from stakeholders, as it is now </p><p>doing, but should also factor them into the final regulation. </p><p> </p><p>Transport Issues </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Emilio Maraini, Senior Advisor to the Minister of </p><p>Transport, explained that Italy\'s top transport priority is </p><p>financing infrastructure investment.  Much transport </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>infrastructure in existing EU member states, he said, is </p><p>"near collapse". The situation in the new entrants is even </p><p>worse. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) There are six key transport areas in which Italy </p><p>would like to make progress during its presidency: </p><p> </p><p>(1) Unimpeded circulation of goods and people within the EU. </p><p>The primary concerns here are limits imposed by Italy\'s </p><p>neighboring countries (including Austria, Switzerland, </p><p>France) which are hurting northern Italy\'s economic growth. </p><p> </p><p>(2) Sustainable development of transport, including balancing </p><p>modes to emphasize cheaper, less polluting transport. </p><p> </p><p>(3) Financing necessary infrastructure investment.  Maraini </p><p>noted that the Van Miert report on the Trans European Network </p><p>concluded that this would require E 500 billion over the next </p><p>20 years from the 15 countries of the existing EU, and an </p><p>additional E 100 billion to E 200 billion from the new </p><p>entrants.  Under Growth and Stability Pact constraints, this </p><p>can\'t be done.  Options would include:  Increasing the EU </p><p>share of the payment; introducing user fees; private </p><p>participation and cross funding.  The GOI is looking at user </p><p>fees, combined with interoperable EU toll payment systems. </p><p> </p><p>(4) Transport liberalization, primarily railway and port </p><p>services. </p><p> </p><p>(5) Transport safety and security, including air, train, </p><p>road, tunnel and maritime safety. Negotiating EU agreements </p><p>with the U.S. on a container security initiative and an open </p><p>skies aviation agreement are key. </p><p> </p><p>(6) Galileo. Maraini said there are several issues to be </p><p>worked out with the U.S. on Galileo, most crucially the </p><p>M-code issue.  Maraini stressed that this must be resolved </p><p>before tenders are issued for the industrial part of Galileo. </p><p> "I think a solution will be found.  There is no other </p><p>option," he offered.  Within the EU, Galileo responsibilities </p><p>are divided into among different councils - telecom, </p><p>transport and research.  Thus, he expects that final </p><p>decisions on M-Code will have to go to the European Council. </p><p>Within Italy, Prime Minister Berlusconi will make the final </p><p>call on the Italian position on M-Code.  While there are </p><p>several ministries involved in Galileo issues within the GOI, </p><p>the M-Code falls into the competency of the Italian Space </p><p>Agency, which comes under the Ministry of Research.  The </p><p>Transport ministry is interested in Transport aspects, and in </p><p>the jobs created. The ministries of Communications, </p><p>Productive Activities and Foreign Affairs also all have roles. </p><p> </p><p>17 (U)  This message has been cleared with USEU. </p><p>SKODON </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02501 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
