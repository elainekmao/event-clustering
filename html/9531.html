<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001840 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, CASC, SOCI, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: HANOI\'S TOURIST LANDSCAPE AND POST-SARS TERRAIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Summary.  Tourism dropped significantly in Vietnam </p><p>due to SARS -- at least 30 pct nationwide and as much as 90 </p><p>pct in Hanoi -- in spring 2003.  The GVN is trying to get </p><p>back on track with new promotions and reach earlier targets </p><p>for 2005.  Europeans and Americans, combined, make up about </p><p>20 pct of total visitors;  Chinese comprise nearly 28 pct. </p><p>Hanoi tour operators have blamed "excessive" media coverage </p><p>of SARS for the continuing dearth of tourists.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>THE OFFICIAL VIEW:  BAD, BUT JUST WAIT </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) According to statistics provided by the Vietnam </p><p>National Administration of Tourism (VNAT), 2.6 million </p><p>international visitors came to Vietnam in 2002, including </p><p>approximately 260,000 Americans.  Available nationwide </p><p>figures released by VNAT showed a modest year-to-year </p><p>increase in March 2003 of 1.3% (to 219,302 from 216,488), </p><p>but a sharp year-to-year drop of 30% in April (from 222,299 </p><p>to 155,165).  The drop-off was even steeper in May -- 54 % - </p><p>- from 217,169 to only 99,816.  Figures are not yet </p><p>available for June.  (Note: VNAT listed 724,390 Chinese </p><p>visitors in 2002; it is unclear whether this number includes </p><p>those who enter Vietnam for daily commerce in border towns. </p><p>end note) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) VNAT now estimates that 1,830,000 international </p><p>visitors will arrive in 2003, a 31% reduction from 2002. </p><p>VNAT predicts that it will not be before 2004 that monthly </p><p>visitor averages return even to 2001 levels.  Despite these </p><p>gloomy numbers, VNAT has reiterated Vietnam\'s tourism goal </p><p>for 2005 of 3.5 million international arrivals.  VNAT Vice </p><p>Chairman Pham Tu has described publicly the GVN\'s measures </p><p>taken to combat SARS in Vietnam, including:  tightening </p><p>border controls; imposing temporary restrictions on tourists </p><p>from SARS-affected areas; and offering training courses on </p><p>preventing and containing SARS.  As part of VNAT\'s strategy </p><p>for attracting tourists back to Vietnam, it is utilizing </p><p>familiarization trips, press-trips from SARS-free source </p><p>markets, h </p><p>otel price promotions </p><p>, and television advertisements, </p><p>as well as taking Vietnam\'s message abroad on road shows and </p><p>to international tourism fairs. </p><p> </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR BLUES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) At a recent luncheon to publicize Embassy\'s American </p><p>citizen services, Hanoi tour operators (variously catering </p><p>to clients from backpackers to high-end travelers) </p><p>complained about drops in tourism of as much as 85 to 90% </p><p>over the past four months due to SARS.  Stressing that </p><p>tourism was the "first to suffer, but the last to recover" </p><p>from such problems, the group described 2002 as a "very good </p><p>year," and admitted that year 2004 would be the "real key" </p><p>to assessing the longer-term impact from SARS.  Tour </p><p>operators also complained that "excessive" media coverage of </p><p>SARS had compounded the problem for the tourist industry, </p><p>but expressed appreciation for the fact-oriented, objective </p><p>information produced by WHO and CDC. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Tour operators also described new efforts to provide </p><p>additional services beyond those normally found in regional </p><p>destinations such as Malaysia and Thailand.  One of the </p><p>larger tour operators promotes Vietnam as a distinctly </p><p>"cultural destination."  In this vein, most operators try to </p><p>stress the uniqueness of Vietnam with a rich cultural </p><p>heritage to enjoy, exemplified by Vietnam\'s ethnic </p><p>minorities. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Most of these tour operators claimed their current </p><p>policies were to avoid discounting prices in order to lure </p><p>back travelers, however.  One Vietnamese-owned firm noted </p><p>that its clientele consisted mainly of European travelers </p><p>who book tours after arriving in Vietnam -- "walk-ins." </p><p>(Because these travelers have already invested in travel to </p><p>Vietnam, the logic goes, operators can set pricing to </p><p>reflect a certain willingness to bear higher prices.) </p><p>Online bookings remain a small slice of several companies\' </p><p>overall tour bookings, with operators noting that technology </p><p>can cut both ways: online cancellations were proportionate </p><p>to online bookings during SARS-period. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Comment:  The challenges to returning to </p><p>profitability and riding out the post-SARS storm remain </p><p>formidable.  Vietnam\'s hosting of the SEA Games in December </p><p>2003 should provide a pick-up in regional bookings, while </p><p>the expected 2004 ASEM summit should provide good </p><p>international exposure.  Relatively low labor costs also </p><p>help the tourism sector to absorb the unexpected downturn, </p><p>but tourism officials in both the private and public sectors </p><p>continue to have their work cut out for them. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
