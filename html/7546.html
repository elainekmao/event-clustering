(C) BASED ON MEETINGS WITH KEY GOC AND GOBIH OFFICIALS IN </p><p>CROATIA IN RECENT WEEKS, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT </p><p>TYPES AND LEVELS OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT THE GOC IS PROVIDING TO </p><p>ETHNIC CROATS IN BOSNIA -- TARGETED LARGELY TO THREE AREAS: </p><p>PENSIONS FOR FORMER HVO SOLDIERS, REFUGEE RETURNS, AND </p><p>CULTURAL COOPERATION.  MOST OF THE BENEFICIARIES ARE CROATIAN </p><p>CITIZENS.  THE GOC IS SEEKING TO ENSURE THAT ALL AID IS </p><p>COORDINATED WITH THE RELEVANT GOBIH MINISTRIES AND IS </p><p>PROVIDED IN A TRANSPARENT WAY.  THE GOC MAINTAINS CONTROL </p><p>OVER THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE ASSISTANCE IS CHANNELED TO BIH, </p><p>THUS ELIMINATING THE POSSIBILITY THAT EXTREMIST BOSNIAN CROAT </p><p>LEADERS WILL MISUSE THE FUNDING AS WAS THE CASE -- AND </p><p>PROBABLY THE INTENT -- WITH THE TUDJMAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WE ARE REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS A </p><p>TRANSPARENT PROCESS AT WORK AND THAT THE GOC, UNLIKE ITS </p><p>PREDECESSOR, IS SEEKING TO PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN BIH. </p><p>WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME CONCERNS OVER CONTINUED PENSION </p><p>PAYMENTS, THESE PAYMENTS WERE APPROVED AS PART OF THE DAYTON </p><p>PROCESS.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO COMPLAINTS BY IC OFFICIALS IN </p><p>BOSNIA CONCERNING SUCH ASSISTANCE, WHICH IS RELATIVELY MODEST </p><p>COMPARED TO FIVE YEARS AGO. OFFICIALS WE MET TO DISCUSS THESE </p><p>MATTERS INCLUDE THE HEAD OF THE MFA,S NEIGHBORING RELATIONS </p><p>DEPARTMENT, FILIP VUCAK; ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR THE OFFICE OF </p><p>DISPLACED PERSONS AND REFUGEES, LOVRE PEJKOVIC; AND THE BIH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00866  01 OF 02  181415Z </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO CROATIA, ZLATKO DIZDAREVIC. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PENSIONS/SOCIAL WELFARE PAYMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AT THE TOP OF THE GOC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO CROATS IN </p><p>BOSNIA ARE PENSION PAYMENTS TO FORMER HVO SOLDIERS AND THEIR </p><p>BENEFICIARIES.  THE SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM IS BETWEEN 3 AND 5 </p><p>MILLION USD MONTHLY, WHICH COVERS A TOTAL OF ABOUT 10,000 </p><p>BENEFICIARIES.  THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PAYMENTS IS OVERSEEN </p><p>BY THE MINISTRY OF LABOR AND SOCIAL WELFARE IN CROATIA IN </p><p>CONJUNCTION WITH ITS COUNTERPART IN BIH. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE GOC DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE FOR MILITARY </p><p>EQUIPMENT/TRAINING OR SALARIES FOR BOSNIAN CROATS SERVING IN </p><p>THE FEDERATION ARMY.  UNDER THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON </p><p>MILITARY MATTERS (SCMM) ARRANGEMENT, AND PURSUANT TO A </p><p>BILATERAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOC AND GOBIH, SUCH DIRECT </p><p>SUPPORT WOULD BE CHANNELED THROUGH THE RELEVANT MINISTRIES IN </p><p>THE BIH GOVERNMENT IN A CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT WAY.  ABOUT </p><p>THREE MONTHS AGO, THERE WAS A DEBATE WITHIN CROATIA BASED ON </p><p>COMPLAINTS THAT FORMER HVO SOLDIERS WERE BEING PAID PENSIONS </p><p>AT LOWER LEVELS THAN SOLDIERS IN CROATIA.  THE GOC IS </p><p>REVIEWING THE ISSUE AND IS CONSIDERING INCREASING THE </p><p>PENSIONS PAID TO FORMERS HVO SOLDIERS TO BRING THEM ON PAR </p><p>WITH THEIR HV COUNTERPARTS.  THIS WOULD MEAN ADDING TO THE </p><p>EXISTING BUDGET FOR THIS ITEM BETWEEN $200,000 AND $600,000 A </p><p>YEAR FOR THE INCREASED PAYMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>REFUGEE ASSISTANCE </p><p>------------------ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00866  01 OF 02  181415Z </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) SINCE 2001, THE GOC HAS BUDGETED ABOUT 3 MILLION USD </p><p>PER YEAR AS PART OF A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO HELP BOSNIAN CROATS </p><p>CURRENTLY LIVING IN CROATIA MOVE BACK TO BOSNIA.  THE GOC </p><p>PROVIDES HOUSING MATERIALS TO BOSNIAN CROATS WHO, IN RETURN, </p><p>SIGN CONTRACTS STIPULATING THEY WILL VACATE THE HOUSES THEY </p><p>OCCUPY IN CROATIA ONCE THEIR HOMES IN BIH HAVE BEEN </p><p>RECONSTRUCTED.  ASSISTANT MINISTER PEJKOVIC DIRECTLY OVERSEES </p><p>THIS PROGRAM AND WORKS WITH HIS BIH COUNTERPART TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT ALREADY RECEIVED ASSISTANCE FROM </p><p>THE IC OR GOBIH.  IT IS A "SELF HELP" PROGRAM WHEREBY OWNERS </p><p>ARE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION THEMSELVES. </p><p>THE PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN WELL MANAGED.  COMPLAINTS BY </p><p>BENEFICIARIES ARE RAMPANT OVER THE PROCESS IN WHICH THE </p><p>MATERIALS ARE DELIVERED (IN THREE STAGES), HIGH EXPENSES </p><p>PLACED ON THE OWNERS TO COMPLETE RECONSTRUCTION, AND LACK OF </p><p>GOC INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROCESS.  WHILE FUNDS FOR MATERIALS </p><p>FOR OVER 300 HOUSES HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED, MANY OF THESE HOUSES </p><p>HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED (SEE REFTELS). </p><p> </p><p>CULTURAL COOPERATION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE GOC ALSO ALLOCATES 3 MILLION USD PER YEAR TO </p><p>IMPROVE CULTURAL, RELIGIOUS, AND EDUCATIONAL TIES WITH CROATS </p><p>IN BOSNIA.  THESE FUNDS ARE PROVIDED IN A TRANSPARENT WAY IN </p><p>COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT GOBIH MINISTRIES.

WHILE THE AIM IS TO DEEPEN TIES TO THE CROAT </p><p>COMMUNITY, THE MFA MAINTAINS THAT GOC DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE </p><p>BY SUPPORTING PROJECTS THAT ARE EXCLUSIVELY FOR CROATS.  OUR </p><p>CONTACTS MAINTAIN THAT SERBS AND MUSLIMS HAVE ACCESS TO THE </p><p>PUBLIC FACILITIES THAT ARE LOCATED IN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THERE HAVE BEEN NO COMPLAINTS FROM OHR OR THE IC IN </p><p>BOSNIA CONCERNING THE USE OF THESE CULTURAL FUNDS.  THE ONLY </p><p>COMPLAINTS HAVE COME FROM BOSNIAN CROAT LEADERS (HDZ) WHO </p><p>CLAIM THAT THE GOC IS PROVIDING ONLY "PEANUTS."  (COMMENT: </p><p>THIS IS TRUE COMPARED TO THE $85 MILLION PER YEAR THE TUDJMAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT USED TO PROVIDE TO THE BOSNIAN CROATS DURING AND </p><p>AFTER THE WAR.  THIS MONEY, WHICH WAS CHANNELED THROUGH THE </p><p>NOW DEFUNCT HERCEGOVACKA BANKA, WAS SUPPOSED TO BE USED TO </p><p>PURCHASE MILITARY EQUIPMENT, PAY SALARIES OF HVO SOLDIERS, </p><p>AND PROVIDE SOCIAL ASSISTANCE TO CROATS IN BOSNIA.  MUCH OF </p><p>IT WAS STOLEN BY THE CRIMINAL BOSNIAN CROAT LEADERSHIP. END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>HEALTH INSURANCE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) BIH AMBASSADOR TO CROATIA DIZDAREVIC TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>GOC DOES NOT PROVIDE DIRECT PAYMENTS TO THE GOBIH FOR HEALTH </p><p>INSURANCE FOR ETHNIC CROATS IN BOSNIA.  RATHER, THE GOC </p><p>ALLOWS THEM TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE IN CROATIA AT COSTS </p><p>SIMILAR TO WHAT CROATIAN CITIZENS PAY.  THEY ARE NOT TREATED </p><p>AS FOREIGNERS, WHO PAY HIGHER COSTS.  CROATS IN BOSNIA THAT </p><p>USE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES IN BOSNIA RECEIVE COVERAGE UNDER </p><p>BOSNIA,S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.  THE GOC IS SEEKING TO </p><p>DISCOURAGE CROATS IN BOSNIA FROM TRAVELING TO CROATIA BY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00866  02 OF 02  181416Z </p><p>REBUILDING AND EXPANDING SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE MAIN </p><p>HOSPITAL IN MOSTAR. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT GOC-PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>CROATS IN BOSNIA IS TRANSPARENT AND DONE IN COOPERATION WITH </p><p>GOBIH OFFICIALS.  THE TYPES OF ASSISTANCE BEING PROVIDED </p><p>OUGHT TO HAVE A STABILIZING EFFECT IN BIH.  IT ALSO ALLOWS </p><p>THE GOC TO CLAIM CREDIT FOR SEEKING TO MAINTAIN GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBOR.  AMBASSADOR DIZDAREVIC TOLD US </p><p>THAT THE GOBIH DOES NOT HAVE ANY MISGIVINGS ABOUT GOC </p><p>INTENTIONS WITHIN BOSNIA AND IS PLEASED WITH THE ROLE THE GOC </p><p>IS PLAYING.  THE GOC WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF </p><p>SUPPORT IT IS PROVIDING TO CROATS IN BOSNIA, PARTICULARLY </p><p>PENSION PAYMENTS AND ACCESS TO SUBSIDIZED HEALTH CARE. </p><p>RESOLVING THE ISSUE OF DUAL CITIZENSHIP WILL BE THE ONLY WAY </p><p>FOR THE GOC TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
