<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000882 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/23/2009 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, YM, DOMESTIC POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: MARIB: ALL POLITICS IS LOCAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: SANAA 857 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador E.J. Hull for reasons 1.5 b. and d. </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) Summary: As part of a USG initiative to encourage </p><p>development and security in the underdeveloped governorates </p><p>of Yemen, Ambassador traveled to Marib to initiate USG </p><p>assistance in agriculture, to study cultural preservation and </p><p>to review progress on the U.S. efforts to train and equip the </p><p>Marib Presidential hospital. The visit took place in the </p><p>final days of the parliamentary election campaign. According </p><p>to Marib Governor Nassi, the Islah party could win two out of </p><p>the three seats of the Marib district. End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On April 20 and 21 Ambassador led a delegation to </p><p>visit Marib, a conservative and tribal-dominated eastern </p><p>governorate to sign an implementing agreement on agricultural </p><p>projects with the Governor of Marib, visit the hospital to </p><p>which the USG is providing 5.3 million dollars of equipment </p><p>and training assistance, and engage in discussions regarding </p><p>the future location of a USG-funded museum. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>USG Assistance to Marib </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Marib Governor Abdulla Nassi welcomed Ambassador and </p><p>signed the proposal initiating the first phase of </p><p>agricultural assistance for irrigation, rural women\'s </p><p>development, livestock management, and seed multiplication. </p><p>The agreement also allows for the USG to bring electricity to </p><p>an agricultural research center that will serve the </p><p>governorates of Al-Jowf and Shabwa to develop shade and green </p><p>houses.  Research will be conducted with the aim of </p><p>establishing a second growing season comprised of cash crops </p><p>for Marib and to determine ways to fight prevalent plant </p><p>diseases. Governor Nassi asked for additional assistance in </p><p>bringing local agricultural products to market, canning and </p><p>preserving, irrigation, and help in establishing the mining </p><p>industry of Marib. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Ambassador stressed that the U.S. is currently </p><p>providing nearly USD 8 million in assistance for Marib </p><p>residents. At the Presidential Hospital, the Ambassador </p><p>visited with 15 of the 161 students who were all selected </p><p>from the Marib governorate and funded by the USG to study at </p><p>institutes throughout Yemen and return to staff the hospital. </p><p>The building itself is paid for by ROYG oil revenue, and the </p><p>USG is providing 5.3 million dollars for training and </p><p>equipping the hospital. Note: Marib governorate is also where </p><p>Yemen-Hunt has its main drilling facilities. End Note. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In an effort to encourage tourism in Marib, the </p><p>ancient home of the Sabaen kingdom and the Queen of Sheba, </p><p>the USG is studying a proposal to build a museum to house </p><p>antiquities. The Ambassador visited the storage facility </p><p>where many of the ancient artifacts are stored haphazardly on </p><p>the governor\'s compound, and initiated discussion on the </p><p>location of the museum.  (Comment: Rumors that foreign </p><p>archeologists, including Americans, are taking artifacts out </p><p>of Marib is a continuing source of tension. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Islah Permeates Marib </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) At a dinner hosted by the Ambassador for project </p><p>stakeholders, Governor Nassi told Ambassador that he believed </p><p>Islah would gain one seat in the upcoming parliamentary </p><p>elections on April 27, giving Islah two out of the three </p><p>districts in Marib. Describing himself as a soccer referee </p><p>who happens to favor one side, the Governor explained that </p><p>Islah is extremely active in the local community, focusing </p><p>their campaign on the economy and social services.  Islah\'s </p><p>popularity was clearly visible: several rock formations in </p><p>the shape of the Islah party sun symbol lined the road to </p><p>Sanaa, on the return the delegation passed a large, loud </p><p>convoy supporting Islah, and banners were hung on houses, </p><p>trucks, and businesses.  Nassi described the present </p><p>electoral system as a modern system overlaying traditional </p><p>tribal organization and has called on tribal custom to keep </p><p>violence down. But, Nassi added, tribal allegiances do not </p><p>necessarily follow party lines, and many tribes were offering </p><p>candidates in both Islah and GPC parties for the elections. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) At a local primary girls\' school, the Ambassador </p><p>toured classrooms that had just received 100 of the 4,000 </p><p>school desks provided by the USG to Marib. Local officials </p><p>told the Ambassador that some of the schools that had </p><p>received desks had had no place for the children to sit. At </p><p>the girls\' school, Islah party literature was visible on the </p><p>outer walls, and above the entrance a banner promised that </p><p>Islah would provide a better future and eliminate women\'s </p><p>suffering.  The curriculum appeared overly religious to </p><p>members of the national press who commented negatively on the </p><p>strong religious overtones in the teaching methods and signs </p><p>on the walls. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Fanda Al-Amri, chairperson of the Union of Women and </p><p>Child Development Association and principal of the girls\' </p><p>school where the delegation visited, gave Pol/Econoff a range </p><p>of requests for the women of Marib.  Explaining that the </p><p>short growing season makes it difficult for vegetables to be </p><p>consumed year-round, she requested assistance in providing </p><p>local women with knowledge on how to can and preserve food. </p><p>Turning to education, she said that there is one girls\' </p><p>secondary school serving the whole district of Marib and </p><p>often parents do not want the daughters to travel the long </p><p>distance necessary to attend.  At the same school, she </p><p>continued, there are no chemistry and physics teachers, which </p><p>excludes the girls from taking national qualifying exam </p><p>should they wish to further their education. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Comment: The political race in Marib will be </p><p>determined by who can demonstrate that his party can provide </p><p>more services and reforms to serve the local population.  An </p><p>education leader, prominent in local women\'s organizations, </p><p>Al-Amri represents Islah\'s popularity in Marib.  She voiced </p><p>frustrations with that Ministry of Education\'s inability to </p><p>provide basic education to the girls of Marib, but also </p><p>directly appealed for USG assistance in that area. She proves </p><p>that despite anti-US rhetoric by some factions of Islah, her </p><p>reason for political alignment is at least in part based on </p><p>who she believes will help the girls of Marib. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
