<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003918 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, IS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE VISIT TO ANKARA, JUNE 6, </p><p>2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador W. R. Pearson for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Five members of the American Jewish Committee (AJC) </p><p>including Harold Tanner, president, Shula Bahat, chief </p><p>operating officer, Stanley Bergman, board member, Marian </p><p>Bergman, board member and Barry Jacobs, director of strategic </p><p>studies visited Ankara on Friday, June 6 to meet with senior </p><p>GOT officials Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Foreign </p><p>Minister Abdullah Gul, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and </p><p>General Hilmi Ozkok, as well as AK Vice Chairman for Press </p><p>Murat Mercan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Tanner delivered a message to Turkish interlocutors </p><p>that the Middle East Peace Road Map may change regional </p><p>dynamics, just as the fall of Iraq changed many things in the </p><p>region and suggested that without the fall of Iraq, there </p><p>might not have been an opportunity to restart the peace </p><p>process.  He cautioned that the new dynamic places a greater </p><p>burden on Turkey to define its place in the world order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) High-level Turkish interlocutors reiterated </p><p>consistently similar themes to Tanner at each visit.  Erdogan </p><p>noted the importance of the AJC and praised its efforts on </p><p>behalf of Turkey in Washington.  He also stressed that Turkey </p><p>could play a major role in the Middle East, commenting that </p><p>Gul was planning to visit Sharon and Abu Mazen and that he </p><p>himself planned to make a follow on trip to the region.  Gul </p><p>said Turkish-Jewish relations </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                                   disappointment in Turkey\'s </p><p>level of support for the war in Iraq, but argued that Turkey </p><p>is able and willing to be a valuable partner for the U.S. on </p><p>Iraq, as well as Iran and the Middle East Roadmap.  In </p><p>response Tanner advised the damage to the U.S.-Turkey </p><p>relationship can be repaired, but with actions, not words. </p><p>Reacting to Gul\'s comment that Turkey has no objection to a </p><p>resolution on the Armenian issue as long as the word </p><p>"genocide" is not used, Jacobs said the AJC will continue to </p><p>lobby against an Armenian genocide resolution, but it will be </p><p>more difficult to defeat than in previous years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Tanner thanked Ozkok, his last appointment of the </p><p>day, for what he described as a summation of Turkey\'s foreign </p><p>policy and recommended that Ozkok (i.e., the Turkish </p><p>government) suggest things they can/are doing.  Ozkok </p><p>described the current rift (with the U.S.) as a </p><p>"misunderstanding" and insisted Turkey "could and should play </p><p>an important role in Iraq."  Observing that the Armenian </p><p>genocide issue posed bilateral and multilateral challenges </p><p>for Turkey, Ozkok asserted that Turkey is very careful in its </p><p>dealings with Iran and Syria since they are immediate </p><p>neighbors. Tanner cautioned that members of Congress were </p><p>surprised, hurt and offended that a strategic partner such as </p><p>Turkey had not supported the U.S., which would make it much </p><p>harder to defeat the Armenian genocide resolution this year. </p><p>Tanner recommended that Turkey help with the humanitarian and </p><p>infrastructure rebuilding of Iraq.   Concluding the meeting </p><p>with Ozkok, the Ambassador suggested that it would be helpful </p><p>if Turkey explained what it considered to be legitimate </p><p>activities, i.e., refueling or training, that could be </p><p>conducted at Incirlik, </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
