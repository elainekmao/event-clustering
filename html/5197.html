<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 000127 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR (BOGUE AND BRADTKE), EUR/RPM (BAME) AND </p><p>EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p>NSC FOR FRIED AND TEPPER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, HR, AL, PARM, HR, AL, NATO, Defense Reform (Mil & NATO) </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA EAGER TO MOVE FORWARD TO SIGN ADRIATIC </p><p>CHARTER FOR NATO WITH ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ZAGREB 2278 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE ATTITUDE OF OFFICIALS IN THE GOC TOWARD THE </p><p>"ADRIATIC CHARTER," AS PROMOTED BY BRUCE JACKSON, HAS BECOME </p><p>SHARPLY MORE POSITIVE.  CROATIA IS NOW PREPARING TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN A DRAFTING SESSION WITH ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA </p><p>AND LOOKS TO SEND ITS FOREIGN MINISTER TO WASHINGTON FOR A </p><p>SIGNING CEREMONY WITH SECRETARY POWELL IN EARLY APRIL. </p><p>JACKSON REPORTEDLY TOLD FM PICULA ON JANUARY 15 THAT THE </p><p>CHARTER HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE "HIGHEST LEVELS" OF THE </p><p>USG.  CROATIA HOPES THAT COOPERATION OF THE "ADRIATIC THREE" </p><p>WILL IMPROVE ITS CHANCES FOR AN EARLY INVITATION FOR FULL </p><p>NATO MEMBERSHIP.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON JANUARY 17, WE MET WITH ZORAN MILANOVIC, HEAD OF </p><p>THE MFA\'S DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND ALSO THE </p><p>CHAIR OF THE GOC INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP ON IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>OF NATO\'S MAP, TO GET A READ-OUT ON THE JANUARY 15 VISIT TO </p><p>ZAGREB OF BRUCE JACKSON, PRESIDENT OF THE PROJECT ON </p><p>TRANSITIONAL DEMOCRACIES.  JACKSON\'S VISIT WAS LOW-PROFILE; </p><p>HE SOUGHT TO AVOID THE UNHELPFUL DEBATE IN THE CROATIAN PRESS </p><p>THAT FOLLOWED HIS SEPTEMBER 2002 VISIT TO ZAGREB (REF). </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00127  01 OF 02  171618Z </p><p>3.  (C) MILANOVIC SAID JACKSON ASSERTED TO FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>PICULA THAT THE IDEA OF THE ADRIATIC CHARTER HAS THE FULL </p><p>SUPPORT OF THE "HIGHEST LEVELS" OF THE USG, PARTICULARLY OF </p><p>THE NSC AND SPECIFICALLY OF NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER DR. </p><p>RICE.  JACKSON DESCRIBED THE JANUARY 10 DINNER HOSTED BY THE </p><p>ALBANIAN AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON, ATTENDED BY THE CROATIAN </p><p>AND MACEDONIAN AMBASSADORS AND ALSO BY KEY SENIOR USG </p><p>POLICYMAKERS, AS AN AFFIRMATION OF THE USG\'S SUPPORT FOR HIS </p><p>EFFORT TO PUSH THE ADRIATIC CHARTER FORWARD.  WHILE MILANOVIC </p><p>UNDERSTANDS THAT JACKSON IS NOT A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, HE IS </p><p>CONVINCED THAT JACKSON IS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE USG IN THIS </p><p>MATTER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MILANOVIC SAID THAT THE LEVEL OF RECEPTIVENESS TO THE </p><p>IDEA OF GROUPING TOGETHER THE REMAINING "CONTINUING </p><p>ASPIRANTS" INTO THE "ADRIATIC THREE" IS GAINING SUPPORT </p><p>WITHIN THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT.  GOC OFFICIALS HAVE COME </p><p>AROUND TO JACKSON\'S REASONING THAT IT IS EASIER TO GET THE </p><p>ATTENTION OF WASHINGTON -- AND OTHER CAPITALS IN THE ALLIANCE </p><p>-- WITH THREE FOREIGN MINISTERS ACTING TOGETHER RATHER THAN </p><p>SEPARATELY.  CONVINCING THE CROATIAN PUBLIC WILL BE A MUCH </p><p>MORE DIFFICULT TASK.  THE PUBLIC -- AND MANY OPINION LEADERS </p><p>-- WILL CONTINUE TO RESIST ANY SORT OF REGIONAL GROUPING, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IF IT SMACKS OF RE-CREATING THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MILANOVIC SAID THAT FOREIGN MINISTER PICULA AND </p><p>JACKSON AGREED TO A COURSE OF EVENTS WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO THE </p><p>SIGNING OF AN "ADRIATIC CHARTER" IN WASHINGTON IN APRIL.  THE </p><p>FIRST EVENT IS A MEETING OF POLITICAL DIRECTORS IN SKOPJE ON </p><p>JANUARY 23 (MILANOVIC WILL LEAD CROATIA\'S DELEGATION).  THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00127  01 OF 02  171618Z </p><p>SKOPJE MEETING WAS ORIGINALLY BILLED AS A DRAFTING SESSION, </p><p>BUT MILANOVIC CLAIMS IT IS TOO EARLY IN THE PROCESS TO DRAFT. </p><p> HE EXPECTS POLITICAL DIRECTORS TO AGREE ON BASIC ELEMENTS </p><p>FROM WHICH A DRAFT CAN BE PUT TOGETHER LATER.  IN MARCH, ONCE </p><p>A TEXT IS NEAR COMPLETION, THE "A-THREE" FOREIGN MINISTERS </p><p>(MILANOVIC IS ALREADY USING THE MONIKER) WILL MEET IN </p><p>DUBROVNIK TO AGREE ON A FINAL DRAFT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ONCE A DRAFT CHARTER IS AGREED UPON AMONG THE THREE, </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTERS WILL TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON FOR A SIGNING </p><p>CEREMONY.  MILANOVIC SAID JACKSON ASSURED HIM SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL WILL SIGN THE CHARTER WITH THE THREE FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTERS.  AFTER THE SIGNING CEREMONY, JACKSON TOLD PICULA </p><p>THAT THERE WOULD BE A PHOTO OPPORTUNITY WITH VICE PRESIDENT </p><p>CHENEY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN A SHARP SHIFT FROM VIEWS EXPRESSED JUST FOUR </p><p>MONTHS EARLIER, MILANOVIC SAID CROATIA WOULD WELCOME THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF OTHER STATES IN THE REGION, AND EVEN SAID </p><p>THAT IF OTHER STATES, INCLUDING BOSNIA AND YUGOSLAVIA WANT TO </p><p>JOIN THE ADRIATIC GROUP, "SO MUCH THE BETTER."  MILANOVIC </p><p>SAID CROATIA UNDERSTANDS HOW IMPORTANT THE ADRIATIC CHARTER </p><p>COULD BE TO CROATIA\'S FUTURE.  MILANOVIC ALSO KNOWS HOW </p><p>IMPORTANT CROATIA\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE CHARTER IS FOR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1518 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00127  02 OF 02  171618Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NRRC-00  NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SSR-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /008W </p><p>                  ------------------276EFD  171619Z /38 </p><p>O 171605Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9235 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION USNATO IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000127 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR (BOGUE AND BRADTKE), EUR/RPM (BAME) AND </p><p>EUR/SCE (NARDI) </p><p>NSC FOR FRIED AND TEPPER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, NATO, HR, AL, MK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00127  02 OF 02  171618Z </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA EAGER TO MOVE FORWARD TO SIGN ADRIATIC </p><p>CHARTER FOR NATO WITH ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA </p><p> </p><p>JACKSON\'S SUCCESS.

(C) CROATIA\'S NEW READINESS TO ACCEPT JACKSON\'S IDEA OF </p><p>AN ADRIATIC CHARTER REFLECTS A SOBER, MATURING UNDERSTANDING </p><p>OF WHERE ITS CANDIDACY FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP STANDS </p><p>POST-PRAGUE.  CROATIA DIDN\'T LIKE THE ARGUMENTS JACKSON PUT </p><p>FORWARD IN SEPTEMBER FAVORING A NEW GROUPING OF CANDIDATES, </p><p>BUT THAT DIDN\'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE ARGUMENTS WERE </p><p>CONVINCING.  NOW THE GOC -- AT LEAST AT SENIOR LEVELS -- HAS </p><p>BEGUN TO COME AROUND.  BUT THE RACAN GOVERNMENT HAS SO FAR </p><p>NOT EVEN BEGUN TO PRESENT THE IDEA OF A CHARTER TO THE </p><p>PUBLIC, THERE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE RESISTANCE TO ALIGNING </p><p>CROATIA WITH OTHER STATES OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, AND -- IN </p><p>CONTRAST TO OTHER CANDIDATES -- JACKSON IS STILL NOT YET </p><p>ENJOYING SUSTAINED ACCESS TO GOC LEADERS. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
