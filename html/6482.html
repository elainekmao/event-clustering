<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000768 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, IZ, CA, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA OPPOSED TO IRAQ DISCUSSION IN OTHER UN FORA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 70678 B. USUN 710 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL/MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.(C)  On March 18, POL/MC delivered points in Ref A to </p><p>Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International </p><p>Trade (DFAIT) Political Director Jim Wright, urging Canada\'s </p><p>support in keeping the Iraq debate out of the UNGA and UNCHR. </p><p>Wright pledged that Canada will not be drawn into such UN </p><p>"side shows" and will work, as appropriate, to discourage </p><p>such initiatives on the part of others.  Canada\'s record in </p><p>promoting the UNCHR as a forum for serious debate was as </p><p>solid as they come, and it believed that any UNGA special </p><p>session on Iraq would serve no useful purpose. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Referring to Foreign Minister Graham\'s telephone </p><p>conversation yesterday evening with Secretary Powell, Wright </p><p>reiterated that the GOC understood the reasons why the U.S. </p><p>needed to move forward on Iraq and would not engage in </p><p>criticism and second-guessing.  The GOC was looking beyond </p><p>the conflict, which it hoped would be mercifully short, and </p><p>hoped for a quick transition to a post-confict phase in which </p><p>it intended to do its part in a, UN-led reconstruction </p><p>effort. </p><p> </p><p>Kelly </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
