<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000348 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PINS, ECON, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S BANKS: PASSING THE BUCK ON TO BORROWERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: RANGOON 299 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The GOB has settled on a response to the </p><p>banking crisis that will likely just expedite the disaster it </p><p>is ostensibly trying to avoid.  The regime, through a </p><p>military-run committee, demanded that banks restore liquidity </p><p>by calling in loans.  With the economy at a standstill, many </p><p>businesses will now have to make their March payrolls while </p><p>under increasing pressure from the banks and Military </p><p>Intelligence for prepayment of loans.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>The GOB\'s "Market-Based" Solution </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) After early hints that the regime might rescue Burma\'s </p><p>troubled banks with Central Bank loans, it has instead </p><p>settled on a "solution" to the private banks liquidity </p><p>problems that throws the burden on to business and other </p><p>borrowers.  The first step down this path came with the </p><p>formation in early March of the "Private Bank Management </p><p>Committee," chaired by politically influential SPDC member </p><p>Quartermaster General Lieutenant General Tin Aung Myin Oo. </p><p>The regime charged this Committee, which also includes top </p><p>Finance Ministry and Central Bank officials, to work closely </p><p>with Military Intelligence (MI) to resolve the problems in </p><p>the banks. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Committee directed that banks rebuild their cash </p><p>position through early repayment of loans.  Repayments are to </p><p>occur according to a rigid timetable, with 40 percent of </p><p>outstanding loans due by the end of April.  Not all borrowers </p><p>are subject to the Committee\'s fiat, though.  According to </p><p>one banker, while his bank had to provide a list of large </p><p>borrowers (of 50 million kyat -- about $50,000 -- and up), </p><p>AWB (the locus of the banking crisis) had to submit data on </p><p>all of its borrowers to the Committee.  Those borrowers who </p><p>are reluctant or unable to pony up the called loans will </p><p>probably have to answer to MI, one banker suggested. </p><p> </p><p>Business Shoulders the Burden </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Local businesspeople, meanwhile, are shaking their </p><p>heads at the GOB\'s decision to make them responsible for the </p><p>resolution of the banks\' problems.  Most companies are </p><p>already staggering under the weight of the credit crunch </p><p>(private bank loans have not been granted since the start of </p><p>the crisis) and the inability to draw fully on deposit </p><p>accounts in various private banks.  The cash flow problems </p><p>afflicting many businesses will only be exacerbated by the </p><p>new obligation to repay nearly half of outstanding loans </p><p>(including even mortgage loans) in short order.  Reflecting </p><p>these concerns, and the current scramble for kyat, the value </p><p>of the dollar has dropped nearly 13 percent in value against </p><p>the kyat since March 1 (bottoming out at 840 kyat/dollar on </p><p>March 14), and the spot value of gold fell an additional 2.25 </p><p>percent in the week ending March 14.  Depressed asset prices </p><p>will add an additional burden to businesses trying to offload </p><p>some of their property to make ends meet. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Meanwhile, while borrowers tremble, the situation for </p><p>some banks may be stabilizing.  With withdrawal limits for </p><p>each depositor steady at 100,000 kyat/week, the private banks </p><p>still face a maximum outflow of only 18 billion kyat/week. </p><p>One official at a large bank told us that his institution had </p><p>been able, between new deposits and hastened loan repayments, </p><p>to counteract withdrawals and even witness a small net </p><p>improvement in its cash position during the week ending March </p><p>14.  However, this situation is tenuous at best. </p><p>Additionally, total deposits have continued to decline -- a </p><p>sure sign of fading public confidence in the banks. </p><p> </p><p>Asking for Trouble </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The GOB\'s curious policy decision, which simply </p><p>encourages the banking crisis to infect the broader economy, </p><p>is, of course, exactly the opposite of what most Central </p><p>Banks do when faced with a bank run.  Normally Central Banks </p><p>do back flips to avoid calling loans because of the negative </p><p>spillover effects such actions have.  In Burma, however, that </p><p>most shunned of options has become the government\'s policy </p><p>choice.  Presumably this is because the GOB fears the </p><p>inflationary impact of bailing out the private banks. </p><p>However, the net result of this decision is just to spread </p><p>the pain from one set of innocent bystanders (the depositors) </p><p>to another (the borrowers).  In no way does this help. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Hopefully, the government will take another look at </p><p>this approach.  In any case, however, it is becoming </p><p>increasingly apparent that the entire catastrophe will have </p><p>at least two results.  First, more and more of the economy </p><p>will go underground, the only place where credit is available </p><p>and trade can now transpire.  Even when the banking mess is </p><p>cleaned up, most commerce may remain in the shadows, having </p><p>learned its lesson on the hazards of doing business in the </p><p>daylight.  Second, the short-term future for companies, their </p><p>employees, and the economy as a whole, is imperiled.  At the </p><p>end of March, already weak firms, faced with payroll and </p><p>accelerated loan payments, could easily go under or be forced </p><p>to lay off thousands of workers -- with potentially serious </p><p>social consequences.  And, if they survive March, they may </p><p>have to do the whole dance again in April (and every month </p><p>thereafter).  Not a pleasant prospect for anyone in business </p><p>in Burma these days. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
