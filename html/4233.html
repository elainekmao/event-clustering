Summary. Charge met with UNDP Resident Representative </p><p>Victor Angelo on November 4 to review recent developments in </p><p>the humanitarian food crisis in Zimbabwe.  Angelo was </p><p>particularly interested in discussing a possible donation of </p><p>U.S. wheat/wheat flour to the World Food Program (WFP), which </p><p>would in turn monetize this commodity and thereby involve the </p><p>private sector in helping to address the food crisis, at </p><p>least in the urban context.  The discussion centered on </p><p>possible complications, policy considerations (positive as </p><p>well as negative), and logistical issues.  While nothing </p><p>concrete was proffered, nor committed to, by either side, it </p><p>is our view that provision of U.S. wheat/wheat flour could </p><p>yield important benefits, both programatically and </p><p>policy-wise.  We request that Washington examine the </p><p>feasibility of such an intervention and look into the </p><p>availability of wheat/wheat flour that could be donated to </p><p>WFP for monetization.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>The Situation </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Angelo underlined that the lack of food in rural areas </p><p>remains the principal focus of the UN\'s Consolidated Appeal </p><p>for Zimbabwe (CAP).  However, there is also a growing food </p><p>crisis in the cities that is projected to put 850,000 persons </p><p>at risk, and possibly more if the ongoing rural to urban </p><p>migration expands.  Certain commodity staples, such as maize </p><p>meal, are increasingly unavailable, and potential substitute </p><p>commodities are simply too expensive for the poorest, most </p><p>food-vulnerable urban population to buy.  In the past, bread </p><p>was the principal alternative to maize meal, but it too is </p><p>increasingly in shortage due to dwindling wheat/wheat flour </p><p>stocks and looks to remain so for the foreseeable future. </p><p>The reasons for this are manifold. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In an average year, Zimbabwe produces approximately </p><p>300,000 metric tons (MT) of wheat against consumption needs </p><p>of 400,000 MT.  The difference is normally covered by imports </p><p>of approximately 100,000 MT of hard wheat, which is required </p><p>for blending purposes with softer local wheat varieties. </p><p>Virtually all of Zimbabwe\'s domestic wheat production has </p><p>traditionally come from commercial farms, much of it as </p><p>irrigated winter wheat.  Disruption of the commercial farming </p><p>sector by President Mugabe\'s purported "land reform" has </p><p>seriously damaged this production cycle.  While there is not </p><p>yet an accurate figure for how much winter wheat will be </p><p>harvested from the past winter\'s crop (by the end of </p><p>November), the Food and Agriculture Organization is </p><p>projecting about 100,000 MT total for the year, leaving a </p><p>shortfall of 250,000 MT, taking into account planned imports </p><p>of hard wheat. </p><p> </p><p>4.  At this point, there is no prospect that the GOZ\'s Grain </p><p>Marketing Board (GMB), the parastatal that monopolizes both </p><p>the import of cereals and the purchase of local cereal crops, </p><p>will be able to cover this shortfall.  A critical lack of </p><p>forex has thus far hampered GMB attempts to purchase enough </p><p>maize to cover the massive shortage of that commodity; in </p><p>this context, sourcing of sufficient wheat to meet normal </p><p>demand appears highly unlikely.  It is a fact, however, that </p><p>demand has not fallen.  In urban areas the demand for bread </p><p>has increased as a substitute for unobtainable maize meal at </p><p>a time when the supply of wheat/wheat flour is actually </p><p>diminishing.  The results are predictable. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The GOZ\'s attempts to impose a fixed sales price for a </p><p>basic loaf of bread, as well as a fixed price at which </p><p>millers and bakers purchase the wheat to produce bread, have </p><p>floundered.  The fixed profit margin between purchase price </p><p>of flour and the sale price of bread has become nonsensical </p><p>as the exchange rate of the Zimbabwe dollar has plunged, </p><p>increasing the cost of imported inputs.  Many domestic inputs </p><p>have also risen.  As a result, millers and bakers complain </p><p>that they can hardly produce basic loaves of bread without a </p><p>loss, if the bread is sold at the mandated price. </p><p> </p><p>6.  This has led to a number of defensive market strategies, </p><p>including selling bread at double or more the set price, </p><p>easily accomplished in an environment where product shortage </p><p>dominates.  Millers have also reportedly used the inadequate </p><p>supply of wheat allotted them by the GMB to mill cake flour, </p><p>which is used to produce premium breads, bread rolls, and </p><p>other products that are non-price controlled and offer a </p><p>higher profit margin.  Bakers add onion flakes to dough or </p><p>prepare special crusts, declare the product a specialty item, </p><p>and thereby also sidestep GOZ controls.  The end result are </p><p>products that are priced beyond the reach of the poorest and </p><p>most food vulnerable segment of the urban population. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Aware of this problem, the GOZ has reacted in its usual </p><p>ham-handed statist manner.  November 5 newspapers published </p><p>statements by Ministry of Industry and International Trade </p><p>Permanent Secretary Comberbach ordering millers to desist </p><p>from milling cake flour and producing higher-priced products </p><p>until wheat supplies return to normal.  This begs the </p><p>question of when this might occur.  There is little room for </p><p>optimism that next year\'s winter wheat crop will reach past </p><p>levels, given the continuing destruction of the commercial </p><p>farming sector.  It is also implausible that the GOZ will </p><p>generate sufficient forex reserves to source future wheat </p><p>purchases on international markets, given the concomitant </p><p>reduction in the production of tobacco and other cash crops. </p><p>In sum, all government directives and decrees aside, </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s urban poor are about to receive a painful, </p><p>first-hand Macroeconomics 101 lesson on the law of supply and </p><p>demand. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>The Solution and the Mechanism </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  Angelo and DCM strategized over how this problem might be </p><p>overcome, at least until next year\'s maize crop is harvested </p><p>and hopefully provides some relief countrywide, assuming </p><p>normal rains and rebounding communal maize production. </p><p>Angelo said that the provision of wheat to the private sector </p><p>would be the ideal solution, since it has the advantage of </p><p>keeping the private sector in the urban food game (and the </p><p>GOZ out of it) and limits the need for the UN or others to </p><p>establish elaborate targeting, distribution, and monitoring </p><p>mechanisms in urban areas.  It is obvious, however, that the </p><p>GOZ-imposed prices for wheat and bread, and the diminished </p><p>purchasing power of the poorest urban consumers, would </p><p>require some degree of subsidy if such an approach were to be </p><p>viable.  Otherwise, millers and bakers would be </p><p>unwilling/unable to import wheat/wheat flour at world market </p><p>prices because the penury of their customers would mean that </p><p>there would be no market (or profit margin) for their end </p><p>product. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The best solution would be a delivery of subsidized wheat </p><p>that would sidestep GOZ control and go directly to the </p><p>private sector, to permit the production of a sufficient </p><p>quantity of bread that could be sold at a price that the </p><p>urban poor can afford.  Angelo proposed the following </p><p>mechanism as a possible option.  The USG would provide on a </p><p>grant basis a sufficient quantity (to be determined) of wheat </p><p>flour to WFP, which would in turn monetize this commodity </p><p>through direct sale to millers/bakers at the current fixed </p><p>price under terms that would commit the millers/bakes to </p><p>produce standard loaves of bread at a price affordable by the </p><p>urban poor, as in the past.  The WFP would obtain from the </p><p>GMB import permits (and could do so, Angelo opined) for the </p><p>wheat, but at no time would the GMB or any other GOZ entity </p><p>take possession of the product or control of the process. </p><p>(There is precedent for this, since in the past the GMB </p><p>granted import licenses directly to millers/bakers when the </p><p>private sector was able to access sufficient forex to finance </p><p>such imports.)  Angelo said that the WFP could use the </p><p>proceeds from the monetization in various way that would </p><p>support the CAP: financing unfunded supplemental school </p><p>feeding programming; paying for unfunded distribution of </p><p>medicines procured for WHO by the UK and the EU; financing </p><p>unfunded rural Food-for-Work programs and similar beneficiary </p><p>empowerment initiatives; or financing recurrent WFP costs </p><p>associated with humanitarian food distribution in rural </p><p>areas.  WFP would provide to the USG all accounting required </p><p>to justify the use of funds earned from monetization. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Policy Benefits </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Angelo and DCM next discussed the benefits of such an </p><p>approach, as opposed to the drawbacks. </p><p> </p><p>-- There would be no GOZ or GMB control over the process, </p><p>other than granting import licenses. </p><p>-- There would be less pressure on maize supplies to rural </p><p>areas from increased substitution of bread products for urban </p><p>consumers. </p><p>-- The program would bring the beleaguered private sector </p><p>into the humanitarian program, long a goal of the CAP and </p><p>bilateral donors. </p><p>-- Because of private sector and market involvement, there </p><p>would be no labor-intensive need for WFP to organize </p><p>distribution and oversight mechanisms. </p><p>-- The affordability of the bread end-product would be </p><p>self-targeting in that it would keep this staple commodity </p><p>available to the urban poor, preventing politicization of the </p><p>initiative. </p><p>-- The fixed profit margin between GOZ-prescribed wheat </p><p>prices and the set price of bread would prevent bakers from </p><p>making large windfall profits.  (Indeed, lack of </p><p>profitability at current set prices might be the real issue.) </p><p>-- This program would balance the food need equation between </p><p>predominantly ZANU-PF controlled rural areas, until now the </p><p>sole beneficiaries of humanitarian feeding, and the </p><p>increasingly needy and predominantly pro-opposition urban </p><p>areas. </p><p>-- There would no complicating biotech issues. </p><p>-- The proceeds from monetization would help provide local </p><p>currency for UN humanitarian program costs. </p><p>-- The introduction of wheat/wheat flour would not cause </p><p>meaningful market distortions in an environment of massive </p><p>shortage and the extant GMB monopoly over purchase and </p><p>distribution of locally produced wheat stocks. </p><p>-- (for the USG) WFP management of the monetization would </p><p>relieve the USG of labor-intensive management and oversight </p><p>of a bilateral monetization program. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Drawbacks and Issues Unresolved </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  There are also a number of potential negatives to such </p><p>an approach, although Angelo and DCM agreed that most of </p><p>these can be overcome with some creative thinking. </p><p> </p><p>-- The program would support GOZ subsidies and fixed food </p><p>prices that are not determined by sound market principles. </p><p>(In the current economic meltdown and in the context of </p><p>unrealistic GOZ economic policies, including exchange rates, </p><p>some level of subsidy must be factored in if any program is </p><p>to function.  The conditions for a freely functioning market </p><p>do not exist at the present, and it would be necessary to </p><p>approach this as a mixed market/humanitarian intervention and </p><p>view it in the perspective of ongoing rural feeding programs, </p><p>many of which are basic food giveaways. </p><p>-- Selection of which millers/bakers to participate must be </p><p>based on past performance, capabilities rather than political </p><p>connections, and willingness to bake basic loaves rather than </p><p>more profitable products.  This would require careful UN </p><p>oversight. </p><p>-- Potential for "black market" abuses in urban areas would </p><p>need to be monitored. </p><p>-- The availability of cheaper food in cities might serve as </p><p>a magnet to starving rural populations, swelling the number </p><p>of those moving toward the cities.  (This is already </p><p>occurring as we write, cheap and plentiful bread or not.) </p><p>-- The quantity of wheat/wheat flour would need to be great </p><p>enough to close significantly the 250,000 MT shortfall. </p><p>-- Logistically, there would be timing of delivery and </p><p>warehousing issues. </p><p>-- Logistically, a large influx of wheat flour would put this </p><p>commodity in competition with maize for already overtaxed </p><p>port, rail, and trucking facilities. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Recommendations </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  We emphasize that no commitments were made nor implied </p><p>in the meeting, which is best characterized as a </p><p>brainstorming session.  Angelo stated, however, that he </p><p>believes it feasible for the UN to undertake a program along </p><p>the lines discussed above if the USG is able to provide wheat </p><p>or wheat flour.  The availability of this commodity under the </p><p>Emerson Trust -- and competing needs in Afghanistan, the Horn </p><p>of Africa, and elsewhere -- will obviously play a determining </p><p>factor.  The Mission recommends that Washington carefully </p><p>examine the admittedly rough-hewn proposal above in terms of </p><p>policy and practicality.  If sufficient wheat/wheat flour are </p><p>available, we believe that such a program -- or one that </p><p>follows a similar script -- could help fulfill Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>humanitarian food needs while simultaneously addressing USG </p><p>policy concerns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
