For the second day all four dailies had full front page </p><p>coverage and special reports of almost six interior pages </p><p>with a variety of photos of the war. </p><p> </p><p>2. Liberal Party Tegucigalpa-based daily La Tribuna: </p><p>"Inferno in Iraq;" moderate daily El Heraldo: "War, Total </p><p>Offensive;" San Pedro liberal daily Tiempo: "Land offensive </p><p>started in the south--without resistance" and San Pedro Sula- </p><p>based liberal daily La Prensa: "No price increase on fuel </p><p>because of War: President Maduro."  Beginning last night, </p><p>radio and all TV stations and print media have been devoting </p><p>an impressive amount of coverage to the conflict, using as </p><p>sources CNN in Spanish and other international news </p><p>sources." </p><p> </p><p>3. The morning news programs repeated the international </p><p>reports several times. Radio and TV stations are running </p><p>spots telling their audiences to stay tuned for complete </p><p>coverage of the war.  Newspaper "El Heraldo" has special </p><p>radio spots announcements inviting readers to buy the </p><p>newspaper to keep up on developments in the war". </p><p> </p><p>4. "Telenoticias" showed some Desert Storm footage last </p><p>night to explain events during the first war and featured </p><p>interviews with several Ambassadors to Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>5. Italian Ambassador Stefano Cachaquero: "We have said very </p><p>clearly since the beginning that we support the United </p><p>States in its efforts. The Italian government is providing </p><p>support to the airfields that are open to U.S. military </p><p>troops, and Italy will contribute Italian peace forces to </p><p>the reconstruction of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>6. Ambassador of Mexico Walter Astie: - "Obviously we are in </p><p>favor of Iraq disarming and the elimination of a threat to </p><p>other countries.  We are against terrorism but we still </p><p>continue to believe that the best solution for this problem </p><p>is through negotiations through the United Nations. </p><p> </p><p>7. Ambassador of France Michell Avignon: "To begin military </p><p>operations is going to be the unilateral decision of </p><p>President Bush who, he remembers perfectly, said that the </p><p>United Nations had failed to carry out its responsibilities, </p><p>but that he would carry out his.  I am sorry to say, but </p><p>that is called `prepotency and the U.S. is the first nation </p><p>of the world, the first force of the world, so in place of </p><p>the force of right, it is the force of might, this is what </p><p>we are going to experience." </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
