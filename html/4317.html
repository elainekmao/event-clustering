SECRETARY-GENERAL: KNOWING HOW BUSY YOU </p><p>ARE, I REGRET HAVING TO TAKE YOUR TIME ON THIS ISSUE, BUT </p><p>SINCE I ARRIVED HERE AT THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME, I HAVE </p><p>BEEN FOLLOWING WITH SOME CONCERN THE PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF </p><p>JEAN ZIEGLER, THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD. </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, I WAS DISTURBED BY THE ATTACHED RELEASE BY </p><p>REUTERS WHICH GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT MR. ZIEGLER SPEAKS </p><p>ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED NATIONS.  YOU WILL NOTE IN THE TEXT </p><p>THAT MR. ZIEGLER HAS ATTACKED THE AGREED POSITION OF THE </p><p>UNITED NATIONS AND THE VIEWS OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF WHO </p><p>ON GM/BIOTECH FOODS AND HE HAS DONE SO WITHOUT CITING ANY </p><p>SCIENTIFIC AUTHORITIES, STUDIES OR REPORTS.  WFP STAFF IN </p><p>GENEVA CONFIRMED DIRECTLY WITH HIM THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE </p><p>REUTERS REPORT WAS CORRECT AND THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>MISQUOTED. </p><p> </p><p>THE LAST THING WE NEED RIGHT NOW IN SOUTHERN AFRICA - OR </p><p>ANYWHERE FOR THAT MATTER - IS FOR SOMEONE WHOSE CREDENTIALS </p><p>ARE IN SOCIOLOGY AND LAW TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THE SCIENTIFIC </p><p>COMPETENCY OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OR OTHER UN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05540  01 OF 02  141312Z </p><p>BODIES WHICH HAVE STUDIED THE ISSUE OF GM FOODS WITH CARE </p><p>AND CONTINUE TO DO SO.  IT IS ESPECIALLY DISTURBING WHEN THE </p><p>MEDIA ASSOCIATES THESE VIEWS DIRECTLY WITH THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS.  DOES MR. ZIEGLER SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT IF GM </p><p>FOODS ARE BANNED FROM FOOD AID THAT NO ONE WILL GO HUNGRY </p><p>WHEN NEARLY 70 PERCENT OF GLOBAL FOOD AID COMES FROM </p><p>COUNTRIES WHERE MAIZE AND SOY ARE VERY OFTEN GM AND 60 TO 70 </p><p>PERCENT OF PROCESSED FOODS HAVE SOME BIOTECH CONTENT? </p><p> </p><p>THIS IS NOT THE FIRST DISTURBING PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENT BY MR. </p><p>ZIEGLER THAT HAS MADE IT HARDER RATHER THAN EASIER FOR WFP </p><p>TO HELP HUNGRY PEOPLE FULFILL THEIR RIGHT TO FOOD IN </p><p>EMERGENCIES.  MY PREDECESSOR, CATHERINE BERTINI, WROTE TO </p><p>YOU EARLIER ABOUT HIS STATEMENTS PROMOTING THE IDEA THAT </p><p>FOOD AID WAS BEING DIVERTED TO THE MILITARY AND ENDORSING </p><p>THE WITHDRAWAL OF AID BY NGOS LIKE MSF FROM NORTH KOREA </p><p>BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT THERE REFUSED TO GRANT AID WORKERS </p><p>COMPLETE ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.  WELL, WE AGREE THAT </p><p>FULL ACCESS MUST REMAIN THE SHARED GOAL OF ALL HUMANITARIAN </p><p>WORKERS IN THE DPRK, BUT PLAYING POLITICS WITH AID IS </p><p>PROFOUNDLY IMMORAL.

I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE CLEARLY </p><p>INFLAMMATORY POLITICS PLAYED BY MR. ZIEGLER HAS HAD A </p><p>NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF THE HUNGRY - DONORS HAVE </p><p>CERTAINLY QUESTIONED WFP AFTER HIS INTERVENTIONS ON THE DPRK </p><p>AND SOUTHERN AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>IN FACT, AS YOU WELL KNOW, WE CONTINUE TO HAVE TROUBLE </p><p>RAISING RESOURCES FOR THE DPRK AND HAVE RECENTLY BEEN FORCED </p><p>TO CUT THE RATIONS OF 3 MILLION CHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY. </p><p> </p><p>I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION ANOTHER RELEASE </p><p>BY INTERPRESS SERVICE (ATTACHED).  WHILE WE APPRECIATED HIS </p><p>COMPLIMENT TO WFP AND DO NOT DISAGREE WITH SEVERAL POINTS HE </p><p>MAKES, DOES MR. ZIEGLER BELIEVE THAT REPEATED PUBLIC </p><p>RAILINGS AGAINST THE BRETTON WOODS INSTITUTIONS AND </p><p>MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO COOPERATE </p><p>WITH THE UNITED NATIONS IN PROMOTING THE RIGHT TO FOOD?  HIS </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTS HE HAS SUBMITTED TO THE </p><p>GENERAL ASSEMBLY SHOW A SERIOUS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF </p><p>ECONOMICS AND THE DETAILS OF THE FOOD SITUATION IN THE AREAS </p><p>HE PROFESSES TO ANALYZE ON BEHALF OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05540  02 OF 02  141312Z </p><p>I HAVE COPIED THIS LETTER TO MR. SERGIO DE MELLO FOR HIS </p><p>CONSIDERATION.  I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE WITH HIM.  THERE ARE SO </p><p>MANY TALENTED, RESPONSIBLE, AND HUMANE PEOPLE WHO COULD DO </p><p>AN EXCELLENT JOB AS THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO </p><p>FOOD.  AT THE INTERNATIONAL FOOD POLICY RESEARCH INSTITUTE </p><p>AND AT MAJOR UNIVERSITIES, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXPERTS WHO </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF FOOD SECURITY ISSUES AND WHOSE </p><p>CAREERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT - NOT TO PUBLICITY - </p><p>BUT TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE CHRONIC HUNGER THAT STILL </p><p>AFFLICTS THE LIVES OF SO MANY OF THE WORLD\'S POOR. </p><p>SINCERELY, JAMES MORRIS, WFP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR."
