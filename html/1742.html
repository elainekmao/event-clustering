<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001306 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/08/2007 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, OFDP, KREC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEALING WITH UN MISSION DEBT </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) SECSTATE 84936 (B) USUN 1113 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  During the course of a June 1 meeting with MFA </p><p>Permanent Secretary (Ambassador) T.D. Hart, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>presented a letter describing the need for the GON to address </p><p>immediately the potentially embarrassing issue of the </p><p>Nigerian UN Mission\'s outstanding debt to ConEdison.  The </p><p>Ambassador also told Hart that he had spoken with Nigeria </p><p>Permrep Arthur Mbanefo recently, who was very concerned about </p><p>the severe embarrassment this issue might cause Nigeria. </p><p>Jeter said that we concurred and therefore were aproaching </p><p>the GON quietly to urge that this matter be dealt with </p><p>promptly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Ambassador Hart said he appreciated the concern with </p><p>which the USG has handled this issue.  He described Permrep </p><p>Mbanefo\'s past efforts regarding this issue, but added: "The </p><p>Ministry of Finance has not been entirely sympathetic to our </p><p>needs."  Hart did not go into details, but emphasized that </p><p>funds had been made available by the Ministry of Finance to </p><p>settle that particular bill, and said he expected payment to </p><p>be made in the coming week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Jeter mentioned a separate problem gleaned from his </p><p>conversation with Mbanefo concerning Nigeria\'s outstanding </p><p>Mission phone bill in excess of USD 400,000.  Hart said that </p><p>this debt had been incurred during the Abacha Administration </p><p>and that funds were not available in the Ministry\'s regular </p><p>allocation to pay for it.  Hart emphasized, however, that the </p><p>GON would pay its debts.  He said that he was working with </p><p>the Presidency and the Ministry of Finance to obtain adequate </p><p>funds to honor debts, and to meet the pressing needs of </p><p>Nigerian Missions around the world.  The Permsec was </p><p>optimistic that funds would be made available soon to address </p><p>any other outstanding debts of the Nigerian Mission to the </p><p>UN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Comment:  There are a substantial number of </p><p>Abacha-era debts that are still outstanding.  The Obasanjo </p><p>Administration does appear to be trying to pay most of them. </p><p>The problem is that almost all of these debts were incurred </p><p>without authorization and in many cases without funds having </p><p>been made available.  The Permsec\'s assertion that the </p><p>ConEdison bill would be paid in the following week may be </p><p>accurate; however, Nigeria\'s very slow track-record on </p><p>releasing money from the Ministry of Finance, even after an </p><p>expenditure has been approved, would indicate a longer delay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
