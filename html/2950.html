END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FINANCIAL MATTERS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  STATUS OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIFTH REPLENISHMENT OF </p><p>IFAD\'S RESOURCES.  THE FIFTH REPLENISHMENT WAS DECLARED </p><p>EFFECTIVE ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2001.  SINCE THEN, INSTRUMENTS OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02382  01 OF 06  151509Z </p><p>CONTRIBUTION AND PAYMENTS MADE AGAINST PLEDGES NOT SUPPORTED </p><p>BY INSTRUMENTS OF CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT TO 71 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>REVISED TOTAL PLEDGES OF USD $442.5M MADE UNDER THE FIFTH </p><p>REPLENISHMENT.  THE U.S. PAID IN CASH ITS LAST USD $5M </p><p>PAYMENT DUE UNDER IFAD-4 IN MID-APRIL 2001.  THE U.S. HAS </p><p>RECEIVED CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF THE FULL FY02 </p><p>APPROPRIATIONS REQUEST OF USD $20M (USD $15M IS FOR IFAD V) </p><p>AND HAS REQUESTED USD $15M IN APPROPRIATIONS FOR FY03. </p><p> </p><p>3.  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  A REPORT ON IFAD\'S INVESTMENT </p><p>PORTFOLIO FOR 2001 AND FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002 WAS </p><p>REVIEWED BY THE BOARD.  IN 2001, IFAD SUSTAINED A USD $42.9M </p><p>LOSS IN ITS NET INVESTMENT INCOME STEMMING PRIMARILY FROM </p><p>REALIZED/UNREALIZED LOSSES IN ITS EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  THE </p><p>EQUITY PORTFOLIO REGISTERED A USD $100.3M LOSS FOR THE YEAR, </p><p>FUELED BY USD $87M IN REALIZED LOSSES AND USD $21M </p><p>UNREALIZED LOSSES.  DIVIDEND INCOME OF USD $13M HELPED </p><p>SLIGHTLY TO COUNTER THIS POOR PERFORMANCE, AND INCOME FROM </p><p>FIXED INCOME INSTRUMENTS CONTRIBUTED USD $57.3M IN EARNINGS. </p><p>HOWEVER, INCOME FROM GLOBAL GOVERNMENT BONDS WAS MODEST AS </p><p>MARKETS STARTED TO DISCOUNT AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY.  BY END- </p><p>2001, IFAD\'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAD DECREASED FROM $2.07B </p><p>AT END-2000 TO $1.97B.  WHILE THE AGGREGATE LOSS ON </p><p>INVESTMENTS IN 2001 REPRESENTED A NET RATE OF RETURN OF - </p><p>2.26 PERCENT, RETURNS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002 SHOWED A </p><p>POSITIVE ANNUALIZED RETURN OF 2.10 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALSO PRESENTED TO THE BOARD WAS A REPORT ON THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF IFAD\'S NEW INVESTMENT POLICY.  THIS </p><p>DOCUMENT REPORTED ON THE STATUS OF IFAD\'S INVESTMENT </p><p>PORTFOLIO SINCE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW PORTFOLIO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02382  01 OF 06  151509Z </p><p>INVESTMENT POLICY IN JANUARY 2002.  A KEY ACHIEVEMENT IS </p><p>THAT IFAD\'S FINANCIAL TEAM HAS CUT THE SHARE OF EQUITIES IN </p><p>THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO ABOUT 18 PERCENT BY MARCH 12 AND </p><p>IS PREPARED TO SELL OFF ADDITIONAL EQUITY WHEN MARKET </p><p>CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE TO MEET THE TARGET CEILING OF 10 </p><p>PERCENT. THEY HAVE ALSO AMENDED INVESTMENT GUIDELINES FOR </p><p>DIVERSIFIED FIXED-INCOME MANDATES TO REFLECT THE CREDIT </p><p>FLOOR OF AA- MANDATED IN THE NEW INVESTMENT POLICY.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE PAPER NOTES THAT THE POTENTIAL AVERAGE RATE OF </p><p>RETURN ON THE NEW ASSET ALLOCATION HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM 7 </p><p>PERCENT UNDER THE PREVIOUS POLICY TO 5.6 PERCENT UNDER THE </p><p>NEW POLICY. ALSO, THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF THE PORTFOLIO </p><p>UNDER THE NEW POLICY HAS BEEN ALMOST HALVED FROM 8.2 TO 4.2 </p><p>PERCENT.  THE USDEL, AMONG OTHERS, COMPLIMENTED MANAGEMENT </p><p>ON THE RAPID IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW POLICY AND URGED </p><p>DIVESTITURE TO THE 10 PERCENT TARGET AS QUICKLY AS MARKET </p><p>CONDITIONS PERMIT THE MINIMIZATION/AVOIDANCE OF LOSSES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR COMMITMENT.  THE RESOURCES </p><p>AVAILABLE FOR COMMITMENT WERE CONSIDERED AND THE BOARD </p><p>APPROVED THE USE OF THE ADVANCE COMMITMENT AUTHORITY (ACA) </p><p>FOR UP TO USD $106.2M.

USDEL SUPPORTS THE USE OF ACA ON A LIMITED </p><p>BASIS, AS A SHORT-TERM BRIDGING TOOL TO BE USED PRUDENTLY. </p><p>THE CEILING OF 3 YEARS OF REFLOWS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A </p><p>MAXIMUM FOR TEMPORARY EMERGENCIES AND NOT AN ALLOWANCE FOR </p><p>REGULAR USAGE.  ALONG WITH OTHER DELEGATIONS, THE USDEL </p><p>REQUESTED FROM MANAGEMENT THAT FUTURE DOCUMENTS INCLUDE MORE </p><p>INFORMATION ON SOURCES AND USES OF ACA CALCULATIONS.  IFAD </p><p>MANAGEMENT NOTED THAT THE FUND WAS ADDRESSING THE CURRENT </p><p>ISSUE OF LIMITED RESOURCES BY BOTH USING ACA AND BY REDUCING </p><p>THE LENDING PROGRAM (FROM THE USD $450M (REAL) TARGET). </p><p>THIS ISSUE IS ALSO UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE CONSULTATIVE </p><p>GROUP FOR THE SIXTH REPLENISHMENT NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  STATUS REPORT ON PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. </p><p>IFAD\'S TOTAL STOCK OF PAYMENT ARREARS (P PLUS +I) AMOUNTED </p><p>TO USD $61.5M AT END-2001, CLIMBING TO USD $1.8M OVER END- </p><p>2000.  MORE THAN HALF (53 PERCENT) OF ARREARS STILL STEM </p><p>FROM AFRICA (PRIMARILY LIBERIA, SOMALIA, AND THE CONGO) AND </p><p>25 PERCENT FROM CUBA.  CUBA, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE </p><p>CONGO, LIBERIA AND SOMALIA ACCOUNT FOR 79 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>TOTAL ARREARS.  IN LIGHT OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT FOR </p><p>CAMEROON, A COUNTRY WITH AN ARREARS CLEARANCE PLAN, THE U.S. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02382  02 OF 06  151509Z </p><p>CHAIR SUGGESTED THAT THE BOARD MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER, AT </p><p>SOME LATER DATE, A STANDARD POLICY GUIDELINE ON LENDING TO </p><p>COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ARREARS CLEARANCE PLANS, NOTING THAT THE </p><p>CURRENT PRACTICE APPEARS TO BE CASE-BY-0CASE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF IFAD FOR 2001.  THE </p><p>EXECUTIVE BOARD REVIEWED IFAD\'S AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS </p><p>FOR 2001 (SEE INVESTMENT REPORT ABOVE).  THE BOARD APPROVED </p><p>THE RECOMMENDATION TO SUBMIT THESE STATEMENTS TO THE TWENTY- </p><p>SIXTH SESSION OF THE GOVERNING COUNCIL FOR FINAL APPROVAL. </p><p> </p><p>8.  REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TWENTY-THIRD DRAWDOWN OF MEMBERS\' </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2002.  MANAGEMENT REQUESTED THE BOARD\'S </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE DRAWDOWN OF USD $330.5 MILLION IN MAY 2002 </p><p>TO MEET 100 PERCENT OF PROJECTED LOAN AND GRANT </p><p>DISBURSEMENTS FOR 2002.  TAKING INTO ACCOUNT AGREED </p><p>SCHEDULES FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES, THIS REQUIRES DRAWING </p><p>DOWN THE REMAINING 40.8 PERCENT OF IFAD-IV AND 61 PERCENT% </p><p>OF IFAD-V CONTRIBUTIONS.  THE BOARD APPROVED THE AMOUNT OF </p><p>UP TO USD $330.5M TO MEET LOAN AND GRANT DISBURSEMENTS IN </p><p>2002.  THIS WILL BE DONE BY DRAWING DOWN FROM THE FOURTH AND </p><p>FIFTH REPLENISHMENTS OR IN TERMS STIPULATED IN AGREEMENTS </p><p>WITH INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS - MEANING THAT THE DRAW DOWNS ARE ON </p><p>A VOLUNTARY BASIS WITH EACH MEMBER FREE TO ENTER INTO ITS </p><p>OWN DRAWDOWN AGREEMENT.  THE USDEL MADE CLEAR IT WAS UNABLE </p><p>TO AGREE TO THE DRAWDOWN SCHEDULE AS REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>9.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.  THE REPORT OF THE </p><p>SEVENTY-SIXTH AND SEVENTY-SEVENTH MEETINGS OF THE AUDIT </p><p>COMMITTEE WERE PRESENTED.

A PROGRESS REPORT WAS REVIEWED CONCERNING THE PROGRAM </p><p>TO RE-ENGINEER IFAD.  THE FOLLOWING FIVE IFAD BUSINESS </p><p>PROCESSES ARE UNDERGOING REDESIGN AND STRENGTHENING OF THEIR </p><p>OPERATIONS: STRATEGY AND FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES </p><p>MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; SUPPORT SERVICES; AND </p><p>KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT.  THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT THE </p><p>DECISION ON THE AWARD OF A CONTRACT WITH A CONSULTING FIRM </p><p>AS AN IMPLEMENTATION PARTNER IS SLATED TO BE MADE BY THE END </p><p>OF MARCH 2002.  WHILE APPRECIATING THE DELINEATION OF THE </p><p>DIFFERENT PROJECT COMPONENTS, MOST DIRECTORS BELIEVED THAT </p><p>MORE DETAIL SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN FUTURE REPORTS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>WITH RESPECT TO BUDGET ALLOCATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ9482 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02382  03 OF 06  151510Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      EXME-00  EUR-00   UTED-00  TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   NEA-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  SA-00    SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------AEDDE9  151514Z /38 </p><p>R 151454Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 3743 </p><p>INFO USDA FAS WASHDC 2126 </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY PORT AU PRINCE </p><p>AMEMBASSY NEW DELHI </p><p>AMEMBASSY CAIRO </p><p>AMEMBASSY ASMARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY YAOUNDE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 06 ROME 002382 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR WSCHUERCH, MJASKOWIAK </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/LYNN REICH AND DAVID WINKELMAN </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA ROSE BERSTEIN </p><p>USAID FOR AA/PPC;DAA/G/EGAD;AFS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02382  03 OF 06  151510Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, IFAD, EAID </p><p>SUBJECT:  REPORT OF SEVENTY-FIFTH SESSION OF IFAD\'S </p><p>EXECUTIVE BOARD. </p><p> </p><p>PROGRESS ON THE PROJECT PORTFOLIO </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE REPORT ON IFAD\'S PROGRESS PROVIDED A COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>AND FAIRLY CANDID REVIEW OF THE PERFORMANCE OF IFAD\'S </p><p>CURRENT PROJECT PORTFOLIO WHICH STOOD AT 241 PROJECTS AT THE </p><p>END OF 2001 AND TOTALED USD -$3.29B. SUB SAHARAN-AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTRIES REMAIN THE LARGEST RECIPIENTS OF IFAD ASSISTANCE. </p><p>THE REPORT INDICATED THAT THE PORTFOLIO\'S SHARE OF </p><p>"UNDERPERFORMING" PROJECTS REMAINS AT THE SAME STUBBORNLY </p><p>HIGH LEVEL (25 PERCENT) AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS.  IT ATTRIBUTES </p><p>THIS POOR PERFORMANCE TO EXOGENOUS SHOCKS SUCH AS POLITICAL </p><p>UNREST AND CIVIL DISTURBANCE AS WELL AS THE AFTERMATH OF </p><p>PERSISTENT DROUGHT IN THE NEAR EAST AND NORTH AFRICAN AND </p><p>ASIAN REGIONS.  IT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT "WEAK PROJECT </p><p>MANAGEMENT CAN GIVE RISE TO A HOST OF OTHER PROJECT </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEMS."  THE PAPER ADDS THAT IFAD\'S LACK </p><p>OF FIELD PRESENCE HAS FORCED ITS REGIONAL DIVISIONS TO </p><p>SEARCH FOR WAYS TO COMPENSATE, ESPECIALLY THROUGH EXTENSIVE </p><p>FOLLOW-UP MISSIONS, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS AND LOCAL </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL NGOS FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT. </p><p>AT PRESENT, UNOPS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HANDLING THE </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF 55 PERCENT OF IFAD\'S PORTFOLIO, FOLLOWED </p><p>BY THE WORLD BANK AT 13 PERCENT WITH THE REST MANAGED BY </p><p>COOPERATING INSTITUTIONS AND IFAD.  IN 2001, IFAD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02382  03 OF 06  151510Z </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY BOLSTERED ITS CO-FINANCING ACTIVITIES WITH THE </p><p>RECEIPT OF USD $270M IN CO-FINANCING, RESULTING IN A CO- </p><p>FINANCING-TO-LOAN RATIO OF 67%, TWICE THE TARGET FOR 2001. </p><p>THE PAPER ATTRIBUTES THE INCREASE IN CO-FINANCING TO A </p><p>"SUCCESSFUL DRIVE TO DIVERSIFY PARTNERS" BUT REITERATES THAT </p><p>IFAD\'S LACK OF FIELD PRESENCE HAS HAMPERED IT FROM TAPPING </p><p>MORE CO-FINANCING.  FINALLY, THE DOCUMENT SUMMARIZES THE </p><p>OUTCOMES OF 23 OF THE 33 PROJECTS WHICH WERE COMPLETED IN </p><p>2001 IN THE FORM OF PROJECT COMPLETION REPORTS AND ASSERTS </p><p>THAT "MOST PROJECTS ACHIEVED THEIR STATED DEVELOPMENT </p><p>OBJECTIVES OF INCREASING INCOME AND RAISING PRODUCTION AND </p><p>PRODUCTIVITY."  THE REPORT IS A HELPFUL GUIDE TO ASSESSING </p><p>IFAD\'S PROJECT PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SYSTEMATIC </p><p>STRUCTURED FRAMEWORK.  THE USDEL STATED ASSERTED THAT THE </p><p>LOGISTICAL FRAMEWORK TECHNIQUE AND THE ASSOCIATED MANAGEMENT </p><p>AND EVALUATION SET-UP FOR MEASURING AND REPORTING PROJECT </p><p>IMPACT WILL HELP DELIVER EVEN MORE PRECISE ASSESSMENTS OF </p><p>PROJECT OUTCOMES, AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE REFINED AND </p><p>IMPROVED. </p><p> </p><p>ANNUAL REPORT ON EVALUATION </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THIS REPORT PROPOSED A NEW METHODOLOGY TO BOLSTER </p><p>IFAD\'S CAPACITY TO ASSESS PROJECT IMPACT.  THE METHODOLOGY </p><p>CONSISTS OF A SET OF EVALUATION CRITERIA AND A DEFINITION OF </p><p>RURAL POVERTY IMPACT.  THE USDEL SUPPORTED THE PROPOSED </p><p>METHODOLOGY TO USE COMMON CRITERIA ACROSS EVALUATIONS, </p><p>ENSURING THAT THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTS IS SYSTEMATICALLY </p><p>ASSESSED AND RESULTS ARE COMPARABLE ACROSS PROJECTS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE OFFICE OF EVALUATIONS ALSO PROPOSED, AS A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02382  03 OF 06  151510Z </p><p>PRIORITY FOR 2002, TO "CONTRIBUTE TO THE ONGOING DEBATE ON </p><p>IFAD\'S FIELD PRESENCE."  THE DOCUMENT NOTES THAT IFAD\'S </p><p>SUPERVISORY MISSIONS, ITS MAIN TOOL FOR PROJECT </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION, ARE NOT PERCEIVED AS AN EFFECTIVE PROVIDER </p><p>OF IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT.  AS ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THIS </p><p>ISSUE, THE EVALUATION OFFICE THIS YEAR WILL CONDUCT AN </p><p>EVALUATION OF IFAD\'S SUPERVISORY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING AN </p><p>ANALYSIS OF THE QUALITY OF AND APPROACHES TO SUPERVISION. </p><p>SEVERAL DELEGATIONS ALONG WITH IFAD MANAGEMENT BELIEVE THAT </p><p>A VERY LIMITED FIELD PRESENCE INHIBITS ITS ABILITY TO </p><p>SUPERVISE AND IMPLEMENT PROJECTS.  THE EXISTING ARRANGEMENT </p><p>OF UTILIZING UNOPS, THE WORLD BANK AND OTHER COOPERATING </p><p>INSTITUTIONS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF IFAD\'S PROJECT SUPERVISION </p><p>CLEARLY MEANS THAT IFAD PROJECTS MAY NOT BE IMPLEMENTED </p><p>EXACTLY ACCORDING TO IFAD STANDARDS.   U.S. STRONGLY </p><p>CAUTIONED THAT THE ISSUE OF INTRODUCING MORE IFAD FIELD </p><p>PRESENCE NEEDS TO BE VERY CAREFULLY CONSIDERED SINCE IT </p><p>WOULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON IFAD\'S IDENTITY AND FUNCTIONS </p><p>AS AN INSTITUTION, AND THAT ANY PROPOSED CHANGE WOULD HAVE </p><p>TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. </p><p> </p><p>13.
