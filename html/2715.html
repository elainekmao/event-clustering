<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001697 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SECSTATE DELIVER/PASS TO DAVID HEGWOOD/USDA WASHDC </p><p>FROM THE AMBASSADOR TO USDA SECRETARY VENEMAN </p><p>EPA FOR ADMINISTRATOR WHITMAN </p><p>DEPT FOR U/S LARSON AND SCIENCE ADVISOR NEUREITER </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR NSC EDSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, ETRD, IT, PREL, SENV, ECON, ETRD, IT, PREL, SENV, TBIO, EUN, TBIOEAGR, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: OUR MESSAGE ON BIOTECH: GOI NEEDS TO HEAR IT DIRECT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 42136 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR MEL SEMBLER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B AND D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  THIS IS AN URGENT ACTION MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST:  I NEED YOUR HELP TO KEEP </p><p>THE GOI FROM SLIDING INTO THE ANTI-BIOTECH CAMP.  SINCE THE </p><p>OCTOBER 2001 EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND PRIME </p><p>MINISTER AND THE VISIT OF AGRICULTURE SECRETARY VENEMAN IN </p><p>NOVEMBER, THE PM HAS NOT MADE GOOD ON HIS PLEDGE TO OPEN </p><p>ITALY TO BIOTECHNOLOGY.  IN THE MEANTIME, AN EVER BOLDER </p><p>MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE HAS DEVISED A CLEVER STRATEGY WHICH </p><p>LEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF CLOSING ITALY TO ALL AGRICULTURAL </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY.  MINISTER ALEMANNO\'S WHITE PAPER, DESCRIBED </p><p>AND ANALYZED SEPARATELY, IS TO BE INTRODUCED INTO PARLIAMENT </p><p>FOR WHAT WILL SURELY BE A HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL DEBATE ABOUT THE </p><p>MERITS OF AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR ITALY.  IF THE PAPER </p><p>IS INTRODUCED IN ITS CURRENT FORM, I BELIEVE THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER WILL BE POLITICALLY HARD-PRESSED TO MOVE ITALY </p><p>TOWARD A BIOTECH POLICY FRIENDLIER TO OUR INTERESTS. </p><p>ACTION REQUEST: I NEED YOU TO HELP ME SEND A WAKE-UP MESSAGE </p><p>TO THE PRIME MINISTER.  WE NEED HIM TO PUT BIOTECHNOLOGY NEAR </p><p>THE TOP OF HIS AGENDA WITH US FOR A FEW CRITICAL DAYS.  I\'M </p><p>ASKING EACH OF YOU TO CALL OR WRITE GOI MINISTERS AND SENIOR </p><p>ADVISORS AS OUTLINED IN THE GAME PLAN BELOW.  OUR GOAL IS TO </p><p>BURY ALEMANNO\'S PAPER IN THE PM\'S NATIONAL COMMISSION ON </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY, AND TO ENSURE THAT FULL GOVERNMENT REVIEW </p><p>PRECEDES THE OPEN DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT.  WE NEED TO GET OUR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01697  01 OF 02  041547Z </p><p>MESSAGE THROUGH BEFORE THE WHITE PAPER\'S INTRODUCTION INTO </p><p>PARLIAMENT, WHICH COULD BE AS EARLY AS APRIL 15.  END SUMMARY </p><p>AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI IS PREOCCUPIED WITH MESSY </p><p>FIGHTS OVER THE BUDGET AND LABOR REFORM, NOT TO MENTION </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY CONCERNS.  (HE RETAINS THE FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>PORTFOLIO.)  ABSENT HIS DIRECT ENGAGEMENT, OR AT LEAST A </p><p>CLEAR SIGNAL FROM HIM, MOST OF THE GOVERNMENT FALLS BACK ON </p><p>EXCUSES AND DELAYING TACTICS.  THERE\'S ONE EXCEPTION, THOUGH: </p><p> AGRICULTURE MINISTER ALEMANNO.  HE IS TRYING TO USE HIS </p><p>POWER BASE AMONG GREENS AND THE WELL-ORGANIZED, HIGHLY </p><p>CHARGED ANTI-BIOTECH FARM ORGANIZATION COLDIRETTI TO LEAPFROG </p><p>OVER THE MAJORITY OF ITALIAN STAKEHOLDERS AND THE REST OF THE </p><p>GOI AND LOCK ITALY INTO AN ANTI-BIOTECH POSTURE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WITHIN THE GOI OPPOSED TO </p><p>ALEMANNO\'S APPROACH; I BELIEVE THEY CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY. </p><p>BUT THEIR POSITION IS UNCOORDINATED, AND THEY NEED MORE TIME </p><p>TO DEVELOP A COHERENT FRONT.  WE NEED TO WORK HARD NOW TO BUY </p><p>THEM THAT TIME, VIA SOME INTERCESSION FROM THE TOP.  TO GIVE </p><p>THEM EQUAL HEARING I URGENTLY ASK EACH OF YOU TO CONSIDER THE </p><p>FOLLOWING PROPOSED ACTIONS: </p><p> </p><p>FOR SECRETARY VENEMAN: THAT YOU WRITE A LETTER TO MINISTER </p><p>ALEMANNO EXPLAINING U.S. CONCERNS WITH THE MINISTRY\'S BIASED </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF BIOTECHNOLOGY AND URGING HIM TO BASE HIS </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF BIOTECHNOLOGY ON SOUND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.  I </p><p>WILL PERSONALLY DELIVER YOUR LETTER TO THE MINISTER.  EMBASSY </p><p>FAS MINISTER-COUNSELOR WILL WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE ON A DRAFT </p><p>AND TRANSLATION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01697  01 OF 02  041547Z </p><p> </p><p>FOR EPA ADMINISTRATOR WHITMAN:  THAT YOU MEET WITH MINISTER </p><p>OF ENVIRONMENT MATTEOLI AT BANFF ON APRIL 12, AND LET HIM </p><p>KNOW THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY IS NEAR THE TOP OF OUR PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>AGENDA, AND THAT WE LOOK TO ITALY FOR HELP.  EMBASSY EST </p><p>COUNSELOR IS WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>FOR U/S LARSON:  THAT YOU TALK WITH AMBASSADOR SALLEO BEFORE </p><p>APRIL 15, AND SHARE WITH HIM YOUR VIEWS ON BIOTECHNOLOGY, AND </p><p>OUR CONCERN THAT ITALY IS ABOUT TO TAKE A SERIOUS WRONG TURN. </p><p> SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS TO FOLLOW SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHITE HOUSE NSC GARY EDSON:  YOU KNOW THE PM\'S DIPLOMATIC </p><p>COUNSELOR, AMBASSADOR GIANNI CASTELLANETA, FROM G-8 MEETINGS. </p><p> I ASK THAT YOU CALL HIM, REMIND HIM OF THE OCTOBER EXCHANGE </p><p>BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND PM, AND EXPLAIN THAT THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER\'S LEADERSHIP IS NEEDED NOW, MORE THAN EVER, TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT ITALIAN BIOTECH POLICY DOES NOT GO OFF THE RAILS. </p><p> MY DCM HAS ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE WITH CASTELLANETA, AND WE </p><p>KNOW THAT HE SHARED OUR PAPER WITH THE PM.  NONETHELESS, IT </p><p>WOULD BE USEFUL FOR HIM TO HEAR IT AGAIN FROM YOU.  HE\'LL GET </p><p>YOUR MESSAGE, AS WELL, TO THE PM. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9482 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01697  02 OF 02  041548Z </p><p>ACTION SSO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   E-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  VC-00    HHS-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OES-01   ACE-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  EPAE-00  DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------7F1222  041632Z /38 </p><p>R 041458Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 3104 </p><p>WHITE HOUSE NSC WASHDC </p><p>HQ EPA WASHDC </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001697 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SECSTATE DELIVER/PASS TO DAVID HEGWOOD/USDA WASHDC </p><p>FROM THE AMBASSADOR TO USDA SECRETARY VENEMAN </p><p>EPA FOR ADMINISTRATOR WHITMAN </p><p>DEPT FOR U/S LARSON AND SCIENCE ADVISOR NEUREITER </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR NSC EDSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, ETRD, EUN, IT, PREL, SENV, TBIO </p><p>SUBJECT: OUR MESSAGE ON BIOTECH: GOI NEEDS TO HEAR IT DIRECT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01697  02 OF 02  041548Z </p><p> </p><p>FOR SCIENCE ADVISOR NEUREITER:  THAT YOU WRITE TO MINISTER OF </p><p>EDUCATION, UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH LETIZIA MORATTI AND TO </p><p>MINISTER OF HEALTH GIROLAMO SIRCHIA TO EXPRESS CONCERN THAT </p><p>ITALY IS ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE A POLICY DISCUSSION THAT HAS </p><p>APPARENTLY OVERLOOKED THE ESSENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF </p><p>SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND RESEARCH TO ANY SOUND DEBATE ON THIS </p><p>SUBJECT.
