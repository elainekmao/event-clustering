<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002014 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: RULE OF LAW UNDER ATTACK - MAGISTRATES ASSAULTED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (C) A magistrate was severally beaten on August 16, </p><p>another stabbed on August 28, both assaults allegedly </p><p>motivated by the magistrates\' rulings in favor of defendants </p><p>who were MDC members.  Justice Minister Chinamasa has refused </p><p>a request by the Chief magistrate to condemn the attacks and </p><p>ensure magistrates\' protection.  Now that the Supreme Court </p><p>and High Court are firmly in Zanu-PF hands, it appears that </p><p>the ruling party is moving to ensure that the lower-level </p><p>magistrates also toe the line.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Mob Beats Magistrate in Chipinge </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) On the morning of August 16 a mob of 150 - 200 Zanu-PF </p><p>militants and war veterans dragged a presiding magistrate, </p><p>Walter Chikwanha, out of his courtroom, beat him severely at </p><p>the government facility where the court is located, then </p><p>paraded him around Chipinge forcing him to chant Zanu-PF </p><p>slogans.  This occurred after Chikwanha granted bail to 5 MDC </p><p>officials accused of burning two DDF (District Development </p><p>Fund) government tractors in Chipinge.  The mob also smashed </p><p>the car windscreen of Langton Mhungu, the defendants\' lawyer. </p><p> The mob then moved on to severely beat the owners and staff </p><p>of the Chipinge Diesel Station where one of the suspects </p><p>works, accusing them of supplying the fuel and training the </p><p>suspect to burn the tractors.  At the end of the owners\' </p><p>ordeal, mob leaders told them the diesel station was being </p><p>repossessed "for the people," and that they were to leave the </p><p>area immediately.   Chikwanha is reportedly convalescing in a </p><p>safe house in Mutare.  Mhungu fled with his family to </p><p>Masvingo.  The owners of Chipinge Diesel fled to Harare. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to a well-connected lawyer, Donald </p><p>Mushayamunda, (please protect) the Police Officer-in-Charge </p><p>(OIC) in Chipinge, on hearing of the judge\'s ruling, </p><p>suggested to Zanu-PF militants to "demonstrate".  In the days </p><p>after the demonstration turned violent, the Chief Magistrate </p><p>reportedly inquired of the OIC whether he had issued a permit </p><p>for the demonstration, whether, consistent with the law, the </p><p>OIC had assigned officers to keep the peace, or whether the </p><p>demonstration was unauthorized and had there been any </p><p>arrests?  The OIC declined to answer. </p><p> </p><p>Magistrate Stabbed in Zaka </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) On August 28 the Zaka district resident magistrate, </p><p>Godfrey Gwaka, was stabbed while in the company of another </p><p>court official.  The court official identified one of the two </p><p>assailants, Naison Chikomo, whom Police have in custody. </p><p>Police are searching for the other, Philip Kusarakesekwa. </p><p>Gwaka, stabbed in the chest and back, was taken to Musiso </p><p>Mission Hospital and released August 29.  Gwaka had heard </p><p>several cases involving political violence and 5 deaths in </p><p>Zaka during and after the March 2002 election period.  Energy </p><p>Bara, who reported both stories in the independent Daily </p><p>News, suggested to us that Gwaka might have been attacked for </p><p>his remarks and judgments in those cases.  The Legal </p><p>Resources Foundation, a local civil rights NGO, condemned the </p><p>Zaka and Chipinge attacks, both of which they view as </p><p>reprisals for the respective magistrates\' decisions.  We have </p><p>heard that civil servants within the Ministry of Justice </p><p>suspect the Zaka attack was politically motivated. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) According to Mushayamunda, the Chief Magistrate met </p><p>with Justice Minister Chinamasa on August 28 to request the </p><p>Minister issue a statement condemning the Chipinge attack, </p><p>and to request protection for magistrates.  Chinamasa </p><p>reportedly refused on both counts, saying the matter was </p><p>political, and the GOZ has information that Chikwanha was a </p><p>member of the MDC. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>6. (C) After packing the Supreme Court and High Court with </p><p>sympathetic judges during the past two years, it appears the </p><p>ruling party is increasingly unhappy with the independence </p><p>exercised by the lower-level magistrates.  Magistrates have </p><p>issued a number of recent rulings that were not favorable to </p><p>Zanu-PF, and they are consequently now coming under </p><p>increasing pressure to toe the party line, or risk political </p><p>retribution.  Chinamasa\'s statement suggests the GOZ supports </p><p>these activities as a shot across the bow to magistrates </p><p>considering ruling against Zanu-PF causes.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
