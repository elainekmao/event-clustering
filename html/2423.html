<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000252 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BAMAKO FOR WARP </p><p>AF/RA FOR BITTRICK </p><p>EUCOM FOR CPT EWELL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: ECOWAS: DIARRA ON DAKAR, LIBERIA, NIGER/ACRI, EUCOM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 2975 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action message; see para 12. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: During a January 24 call on the Ambassador, </p><p>ECOWAS Deputy Executive Secretary Diarra gave a brief </p><p>read-out from the ECOWAS Summit in Dakar, positively </p><p>describing additional funding and staffing for the Peace and </p><p>Security Department.  Diarra sought the Ambassador\'s advice </p><p>on the upcoming EUCOM visit dealing with the creation of an </p><p>OpsCenter for ECOWAS.  Diarra noted the Nigerien Government </p><p>had sought ECOWAS assistance to join ACRI.  On Liberia, </p><p>Diarra agreed the venue of the first meeting on Liberian </p><p>reconciliation should be outside the country to ensure wide </p><p>attendance and to avoid manipulation by President Taylor.  At </p><p>the ECOWAS Summit, Liberia extracted a pledge from the other </p><p>summiteers to condemn LURD activity in Lofa County as illegal </p><p>attacks against a duly constituted government.  The ECOWAS </p><p>Mediation and Security Council will consider sanctions </p><p>against the LURD at its next meeting.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On January 24, ECOWAS Deputy Executive Secretary </p><p>Cheikh Diarra, accompanied by Military Advisor Colonel M. </p><p>Dixon Dikio called on Ambassador Jeter.  PolCounselor and </p><p>PolMilOff also attended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DAKAR OUTCOMES: Surprised that we had not yet received </p><p>the Dakar communiqus, Diarra promised to forward them soon </p><p>(he did the next day).  He described Dakar positively. </p><p>Regarding the new ECOWAS Chairman, President Wade, Diarra </p><p>quipped, "We are happy and we are concerned."  If possessed </p><p>of the requisite political will, Wade was uniquely placed to </p><p>make a positive difference by bridging the gap between ECOWAS </p><p>and UEMOA in the areas of economic integration, Diarra </p><p>believed.  In a brief aside with PolCouns after the meeting, </p><p>Diarra worried that there had been no contact between Wade </p><p>and the ECOWAS Secretariat since the Dakar Summit.  He hoped </p><p>that this did not presage inattention to ECOWAS by Wade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Meanwhile, Diarra noted that the ECOWAS budget had </p><p>been approved.  He had been instructed to complete </p><p>recruitment for his Department, including the OpsCenter, by </p><p>June.  At Dakar, the Heads-of-State had also committed to </p><p>fully implement the community levy.  (COMMENT: We assume that </p><p>Diarra meant the .5 percent customs levy that ECOWAS </p><p>countries are now required to pay to support the Conflict </p><p>Resolution Mechanism. END COMMENT.)  Since only four or five </p><p>countries were current, this commitment, if implemented by </p><p>members, would make a big difference in ECOWAS\' ability to </p><p>fund its projects and plans, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) MONITORING STABILITY: Diarra described the collection </p><p>and analysis process in mind for ECOWAS.  The OpsCenter </p><p>should be able to collect, analyze and disseminate </p><p>information.  Additionally, it would contain a military </p><p>planning and operations cell for peacekeeping and </p><p>humanitarian assistance activities.  Thus far, directors of </p><p>the four zonal monitoring stations (Banjul, Cotonou, </p><p>Monrovia, and Ouagadougou) had been hired, and staff for the </p><p>stations had been nominated.  However, the staff needed </p><p>training in analyzing data and trends, and he expected the </p><p>West Africa Regional Program (WARP) agreement signed last </p><p>year would provide this assistance, though he was waiting for </p><p>a response from WARP.  Funding to equip the monitoring </p><p>stations themselves was being provided by the EU, but this </p><p>support also had not yet materialized.  Additionally, the EU </p><p>had appointed a Belgian advisor to ECOWAS for three years to </p><p>assist with coordinating EU support.  ECOWAS had also sourced </p><p>an electronic map and database system, modeled after the UN\'s </p><p>system, from a company called Rectas (based at Obafemi </p><p>Awolowo University in Ibadan).  Ideally, the monitoring </p><p>center would eventually be connected to the national security </p><p>systems in each member country, in addition to the monitoring </p><p>stations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) EUCOM VISIT: Diarra emphasized that he wanted to make </p><p>sure the EUCOM team, coming for further discussions on </p><p>communications assistance for the OpsCenter, received </p><p>briefings from the Rectas team and the EU Advisor, and that </p><p>the visit was fruitful.  Ambassador Jeter emphasized that </p><p>Diarra and his team should make sure they had a clear picture </p><p>of what they wanted, and communicate their vision for the </p><p>OpsCenter to the EUCOM team.  Diarra stated that they wanted </p><p>to be able to communicate with the governments of </p><p>members-states, zonal monitoring stations, and any ECOWAS </p><p>Force Commanders in the event of future ECOWAS peacekeeping </p><p>operations.  Ambassador Jeter said that he was unsure that </p><p>funding for monitoring stations would be likely, particularly </p><p>for Monrovia and Ouagadougou, given the destabilizing roles </p><p>that Taylor and Campaore had played in the region and their </p><p>involvement in the illicit diamond trade.  For now, the </p><p>Ambassador said, it might be better to think in terms of </p><p>communications linkages between ECOWAS headquarters and those </p><p>states that had been consistent contributors to ECOWAS </p><p>operations.  Diarra understood, noting that the Taylor </p><p>government had been less than helpful to ECOWAS in locating </p><p>an appropriate building for the monitoring station in </p><p>Monrovia or in allowing the establishment of an ECOWAS radio </p><p>station there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) RECONCILING LIBERIA: ECOWAS was working with the </p><p>Carter Center to arrange for a Liberian reconciliation </p><p>conference.  The process had moved in fits and starts, as </p><p>President Taylor had first supported the idea of a meeting </p><p>outside Liberia but then reversed course to insist that </p><p>Monrovia be the venue.  Diarra agreed that a conference </p><p>outside of Liberia was needed to ensure inclusive attendance </p><p>and to prevent manipulation of the event by Taylor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Diarra went on to note that in Dakar, the GOL had </p><p>requested ECOWAS to condemn the LURD incursions in Lofa </p><p>County as an illegal attempt to seize power through </p><p>extra-constitutional means. (Comment: Such a request coming </p><p>from Taylor, is laced with irony.  Twelve years ago, Taylor </p><p>was in the LURD\'s shoes and he considered ECOWAS a harmful </p><p>interloper - now he wants to use it as a shield.  End </p><p>Comment.)  After reviewing a GOL report on the LURD, the </p><p>Mediation and Security Council will consider sanctions </p><p>against the LURD at its next meeting.  The Council would </p><p>likely support some kind of sanctions, such as travel </p><p>restrictions, against members of the LURD.  Dikio, describing </p><p>his last visit to Lofa County, characterized the area as a </p><p>"collection of rejects from the sub-region," (RUF, various </p><p>mercenaries, Guinean dissidents, Burkinabe and maybe even </p><p>some renegade Nigerians!) and agreed that Liberia\'s stability </p><p>needed to be watched closely, particularly so that trouble </p><p>there does not undermine hard won progress in Sierra Leone </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) NIGER AND ACRI: Diarra revealed that he had received </p><p>a letter from the Government of Niger, asking for support </p><p>from ECOWAS to join ACRI (In fact, Embassy Niamey made this </p><p>case in Niamey 1827).  Ambassador Jeter noted that ACRI was </p><p>undergoing review in Washington and that it remained unclear </p><p>what shape ACRI would take.  Meanwhile, we would pass the </p><p>message to Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT: Generally pleased with the outcome of the </p><p>Dakar Summit, Diarra seemed charged to move his Department </p><p>forward in 2002.  Diarra is focussing on the establishment of </p><p>the ECOWAS OpsCenter.  EUCOM will find him cooperative, and </p><p>we believe this project could significantly improve ECOWAS </p><p>capacity in conflict prevention.  Meanwhile, incoming ECOWAS </p><p>Executive Secretary Mohammed Ibn Chambas is due to start work </p><p>the first week of February.  His predecessor Lansana Kouyate </p><p>will finish at ECOWAS in mid-February.  We hope the overlap </p><p>will not only give them a chance to have a smooth exchange of </p><p>the baton, but will allow Ambassador Jeter to meet with them </p><p>simultaneously, ensuring continuity in our working </p><p>relationship with the Secretariat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) ACTION REQUEST: As Kouyate prepares to leave and </p><p>Chambas prepares to take over the helm of the ECOWAS </p><p>Secretariat, letters from Washington (from the Assistant </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>secretary or from Secretary Powell himself) congratulating </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Kouyate on a job well-done and pledging our continuing </p><p>support for the new Executive Secretary would be appropriate. </p><p> This gesture would symbolize our strong engagement with </p><p>ECOWAS and our hopes for the future of the organization.  The </p><p>Embassy will propose text for the suggested letter, which </p><p>will be forwarded to AF/W.  END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
