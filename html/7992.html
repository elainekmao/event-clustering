(SBU) Summary: A visit to the Total/UNOCAL pipeline zone </p><p>in Tanintharyi Division revealed an impressive level of </p><p>socio-economic development.  A lack of government </p><p>interference, and the determination of well-funded corporate </p><p>citizens to push the envelope, have allowed for decent living </p><p>standards, comparative religious freedom, and the development </p><p>of nascent democratic institutions.  Considering these </p><p>companies\' ambitious and progressive policies, and the GOB\'s </p><p>apathy toward funding basic services, the significant </p><p>potential we witnessed would certainly dwindle if the firms </p><p>left.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Unprecedented Independence </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) COM, Pol Officer, Econ Officer, and PAO traveled </p><p>with TotalFinaElf and UNOCAL (the "partners") representatives </p><p>to the area surrounding their 63 km onshore gas pipeline in </p><p>Burma\'s southernmost Tanintharyi Division.  The partners have </p><p>established a corridor around the pipeline encompassing 23 </p><p>villages, the largest of which is Kanbauk, located about 150 </p><p>miles as the crow flies southeast of Rangoon.  Twenty of the </p><p>villages are Burman majority, while the other three are </p><p>Karen.  The partners have been allowed unprecedented </p><p>independence in providing and managing development funds, </p><p>with $1.2 million budgeted for 2003, for a total of $10 </p><p>million since the projects began in 1995, into these </p><p>villages.  This has led to an undeniably superior level of </p><p>economic and social development in the pipeline zone compared </p><p>to other villages in the area and elsewhere in Burma (even in </p><p>other "model villages" assisted by NGO or UN entities).  The </p><p>whole zone had a strong, but positive, feel of a company </p><p>town; organized, funded, and operated by the energy </p><p>consortium. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The partners do not rely on INGOs or the government to </p><p>carry out their projects.  Instead, they use their own local </p><p>staff of 25 doctors, agronomists, safety experts, and </p><p>teachers, as well as several dozen laborers for road </p><p>maintenance. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The partners claim that the government keeps a very </p><p>light hand on the 23 villages under the partners\' </p><p>"protection," providing only security for the area.  The </p><p>military, which is the primary government entity in the area, </p><p>allegedly leaves all of the economic enterprises alone and </p><p>does not harass the schools or hospitals operated with the </p><p>assistance of the partners.  Rare abuses by individual </p><p>soldiers are reported to the partners via elected village </p><p>councils and a complaint is passed on to the regional </p><p>commanders.  According to Total, these few complaints have </p><p>been resolved satisfactorily. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Though there is no way to completely verify the </p><p>predictably rosy claims of the partners, there is no question </p><p>that the economic and social standards of living for </p><p>residents of the pipeline zone appear comparatively high. </p><p>Further circumstantial evidence of a light GOB presence: in </p><p>our travels, we saw only one or two soldiers, one small army </p><p>base in Kanbauk, and one small USDA office tucked behind a </p><p>well-stocked general store in Kanbauk. </p><p> </p><p>Economic Development: Opportunity and Access </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The partners\' strategy for economic development in </p><p>the pipeline zone has two elements: economic opportunity and </p><p>infrastructure development.  The partners have been allowed </p><p>to carry out both with the explicit and implicit approval of </p><p>the government, but apparently with no interference. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The partners have provided numerous economic </p><p>opportunities, mostly agricultural diversification and </p><p>expansion projects.  In one case, using an agronomist hired </p><p>away from the Ministry of Forestry, the partners built a </p><p>nursery to grow 30,000-40,000 indigenous seedlings per year </p><p>(mostly cashews, but also a wide range of other cash crops, </p><p>such as black pepper, lime, rambutan, and durian) for </p><p>distribution to local farmers.  Other economic development </p><p>projects include pig and chicken breeding centers (complete </p><p>with veterinarian and vaccination program) and a large </p><p>pineapple and rubber plantation within which farmers are </p><p>given deeds to plots after a probationary period. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) On the infrastructure side the partners\' </p><p>achievements are remarkable.  Without government </p><p>interference, the partners have built a 63 km sealed road </p><p>that tracks the pipeline (which is buried two meters </p><p>underground).  They have also constructed numerous all-season </p><p>dirt roads that branch off the main road into the villages </p><p>being served.  We witnessed these roads being scrupulously </p><p>maintained by staff and equipment provided by the partners. </p><p>9. (SBU) Socio-economic infrastructure is encouraged through </p><p>education and health assistance, as well as a rare </p><p>micro-credit program.  The partners have been allowed to </p><p>build and stock seven new clinics in various villages, and </p><p>provide medicine, equipment, and personnel to the </p><p>pre-existing government hospital in Kanbauk.  Aside from </p><p>offering free treatment to villagers, the clinics focus on </p><p>childhood vaccinations, family planning, and testing for and </p><p>treatment of malaria, TB, and other endemic diseases. </p><p>Likewise, the partners have been allowed to build and </p><p>renovate 44 schools, provide learning materials, computers, </p><p>and supplement the meager income of the 250 local government </p><p>teachers (thus discouraging the supplemental "tuition" </p><p>classes that most public school teachers across the country </p><p>operate).  The partners have also been allowed to set up a </p><p>private remedial tuition school aimed at those students who </p><p>have failed their matriculation exams.  This latter project </p><p>is most notable as the government is traditionally very </p><p>reluctant to allow new private schools, and very heavy-handed </p><p>on those that are permitted to exist. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Total\'s statistics show impressive results from these </p><p>investments.  In education, Total indicates an 18 percent </p><p>increase in enrollment since the 2000-01 school year.  In </p><p>health, infant mortality is down 65 percent since 1997 (to a </p><p>rate well below the national average), and mortality from </p><p>malaria, water and foodborne diseases, and respiratory </p><p>infections down 70 percent, 99 percent, and 90 percent </p><p>respectively. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The micro-credit program is another important </p><p>success, as banking laws generally make such schemes illegal </p><p>in Burma.  Another exception is made for the UN, which </p><p>carries out small micro-credit programs (using INGOs) in some </p><p>areas in which it operates.  The partners admitted that </p><p>they\'d never received explicit permission from the GOB to run </p><p>this program; however, neither have government authorities </p><p>interfered with the program (or tried to hijack funds) since </p><p>its inception in 1997.  According to Total statistics, in </p><p>2002 560 local people took loans (up to a maximum of $500) </p><p>worth 25.2 million kyat (roughly $25,000 at current exchange </p><p>rates).  The loans, which an elected village committee of </p><p>four people, mostly teachers, distributes, are for a 6-month </p><p>term, with interest due for 5 months at 2 percent per month. </p><p>Since 1997, according to Total, there have been no defaults. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) We saw one example of the micro-credit program at </p><p>work.  A small businessman in a Karen village was putting the </p><p>finishing touches on a small cashew nut processing "factory." </p><p> When completed, the factory will employee eight women and </p><p>produce roughly 150 kg of shelled cashews per day.  When </p><p>producing at top capacity, the women will be paid about </p><p>1000-2000 kyat ($1-$2) per day, a very generous paycheck when </p><p>the average factory laborer earns about 500-1000 kyat per </p><p>day.  More encouragingly, the owner had a rudimentary </p><p>business plan, envisioning early sales to Dawei, the largest </p><p>city nearby, and Kanbauk, then Rangoon, and hopefully someday </p><p>for export over the nearby Thai border. </p><p> </p><p>Free Religion and Democracy in Burma? </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) The partners have also made surprising progress </p><p>encouraging and developing democratic and religious </p><p>institutions in the pipeline zone.  In one of the Karen </p><p>villages, the partners funded the reconstruction of the </p><p>village\'s 40-year old Baptist church.  The partners have </p><p>built or renovated four other churches as well as two </p><p>Buddhist pagodas.  Under the current regime, renovation or </p><p>construction of new non-Buddhist religious buildings is not </p><p>generally allowed; a complaint we\'ve heard loud and clear </p><p>from the Christian community and one that resonates in </p><p>Burma\'s annual religious freedom report. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) The pipeline zone villages are also nurturing very </p><p>primitive democratic institutions, again seemingly without </p><p>government opposition.  The partners have worked with each </p><p>village to establish elected "Village Communication </p><p>Committees" (VCC) that liaise between the residents and the </p><p>partners\' local representatives.  Though some of these </p><p>Committees include the government\'s village Peace and </p><p>Development Council designate, Total claims that these bodies </p><p>operate freely and complain readily if there is government </p><p>malfeasance.  As noted earlier, there is also a democratic </p><p>element to the micro-credit program, which is run by a </p><p>committee of four people, elected each year by the various </p><p>VCCs.  Again, though this committee\'s membership is often </p><p>mostly teachers (government employees), Total asserted that </p><p>funds are not misdirected or misused. </p><p> </p><p>Little Things Mean A Lot, If the Environment is Ripe </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) At first glance, there are two key reasons for the </p><p>success of the pipeline zone.  First, the partners\' programs </p><p>can focus on the whole development picture, not just offering </p><p>assistance but ensuring that locals have access to it.  We\'ve </p><p>seen other similar economic development projects founder </p><p>because of access problems.  Second, the partners, though </p><p>consulting with GOB officials as necessary, are able to </p><p>independently manage their ambitious and aggressive </p><p>programming. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Another lesson learned is the ability, if there is </p><p>a receptive environment, to do much with little in a country </p><p>as starved for everything as Burma.  We define "receptive </p><p>environment" as one which allows adequate political and </p><p>managerial freedom by the implementing organization, and </p><p>which has adequate transportation infrastructure.  If such an </p><p>environment exists, $1 million-$2 million spread annually </p><p>over a broad range of activities can have impressive success </p><p>in improving living standards.  Without such an environment a </p><p>program ten times as large will have only half the impact. </p><p>Unfortunately at this time, as we\'ve reported (see reftel), </p><p>the poor environment for aid in most of the country makes </p><p>successes like UNOCAL-Total\'s a rarity. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) One problem with the overall strategy is that much </p><p>of it is not self-sustaining.  The extant small businesses </p><p>and agricultural and breeding projects already underway would </p><p>presumably continue to some degree.  However, the health </p><p>clinics, schools, roads, livestock care, and micro-credit </p><p>programs would likely deteriorate without the annual cash </p><p>infusions from outside.  The partners are acting as a </p><p>surrogate, and seemingly beneficent, government, so unless </p><p>the GOB decides to start funding basic services and </p><p>infrastructure (unlikely in the visible future), this is a </p><p>problem if Total and/or UNOCAL pull out of Burma.  Should </p><p>this occur, unless their successors have the same pressure </p><p>from stockholders and human rights groups to "do the right </p><p>thing," the projects and programs funded by the partners </p><p>might dissipate. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
