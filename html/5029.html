I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. </p><p>HOWEVER, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS IS THAT THERE ARE </p><p>STILL A FEW OBSTACLES.

I CLAIM THAT THE PROBLEMS </p><p>CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY, IF WE ALL WANT (THEM TO BE </p><p>RESOLVED).  ...  MY COMMENTARY IN CONNECTION WITH </p><p>GENERALS BOBETKO AND GOTOVINA IS UNAMBIGUOUS, AND I WILL </p><p>PERSONALLY PASS IT ON TO THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE </p><p>CROATIAN PEOPLE, AND IT IS THE FOLLOWING:  LET\'S RESOLVE </p><p>THIS PROBLEM, BECAUSE WE ASSESS THAT THE WAITING PERIOD </p><p>HAS EXPIRED, AND THAT\'S WHY WE JOINTLY HAVE TO FIND A </p><p>FAVORABLE SOLUTION BEFORE THIS STORY HURTS CROATIA EVEN </p><p>MORE.."  ASKED TO COMMENT ON WHETHER THE FACT THAT </p><p>CROATIA IS IN AN ELECTION YEAR HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH </p><p>THE U.S. INSISTING ON RESOLVING THE BOBETKO AND GOTOVINA </p><p>CASES, AMBASSADOR PROSPER SAID:  "WE KNOW THAT THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY EXISTS FOR ELECTIONS TO BE HELD DURING THIS </p><p>YEAR OR AT THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR, BUT IT\'S NOT AN </p><p>ISSUE I CAN TALK ABOUT, OR SOMETHING MY COUNTRY MAKES </p><p>DECISIONS ABOUT.  OUR STANDPOINT IS THAT THE PROSECUTION </p><p>SHOULD FINISH WITH ITS ACTIVITIES IN 2003, AND START </p><p>BRINGING ALL OPEN ISSUES TO CONCLUSION."
