<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000104 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR LABATTS: LONDON, PARIS, LAGOS, ACCRA, GENEVA, PRETORIA, </p><p>NAMIBIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: DECL: 01/16/13 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, ECON, EFIN, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: UPDATE FROM NLC PRESIDENT OSHIOMHOLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2744 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER: REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: In a late 2002 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President Adams Aliyu </p><p>Oshiomhole discussed talks he held with World Bank and IMF </p><p>representatives on poverty reduction and worker rights. </p><p>Oshiomhole revealed to the Ambassador an ambitious policy </p><p>agenda, including a possible fight with the GON over a 12.5% </p><p>pay increase for civil servants in 2003.  He said that the </p><p>NLC has grown leery of striking against fuel cost hikes. </p><p>Oshiomhole cited the Administration\'s inconsistent economic </p><p>policies, particularly its failure to address low </p><p>productivity, lack of foreign investment, corruption and </p><p>private sector inertia as major hurdles to improving the </p><p>conditions of working class Nigerians.  The NLC President </p><p>conceded that privatization is not inherently bad, but the </p><p>GON needs to keep parastatals such as the Nigerian National </p><p>Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to protect national and worker </p><p>interests.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Strange Bedfellows </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Ambassador Jeter and Econoff met Nigeria Labour </p><p>Congress (NLC) President Adams Aliyu Oshiomhole in late 2002. </p><p>Oshiomhole, just returning from an IMF/World Bank-sponsored </p><p>meeting with some 90 international labor leaders in </p><p>Washington, characterized the meetings as constructive and </p><p>enlightening.  The IMF/Bank\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy </p><p>Program (PRSP) surprisingly paralleled the NLC agenda, he </p><p>stated.  Oshiomhole, a strong critic of GON dealings with the </p><p>two IFIs, commended their position promoting a living wage </p><p>and the freedom of association -- two crucial pillars for </p><p>organized labor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Oshiomhole stated the IMF had often been the GON\'s </p><p>scapegoat but the truth was that public spending in Nigeria </p><p>had never stimulated economic growth. Nigeria\'s workers had </p><p>many priorities, especially medium to low-income housing, </p><p>added Oshiomhole.  He complained an average worker was unable </p><p>to borrow money to purchase a house, but the GON was doing </p><p>little to remedy this deficiency.  Regardless of the IMF, the </p><p>GON was spending billions of Naira building a National </p><p>Stadium in Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Difficult to Compete with Asia </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Oshiomhole stated that Nigeria\'s markets are flooded </p><p>with Chinese goods and that the international community </p><p>should make the playing field level for all nations.  During </p><p>a visit to China, he observed workers laboring 10 to 12 hour </p><p>days, six to seven days a week. Oshiomhole added that the NLC </p><p>and Nigerian worker would not accept lower wages, longer </p><p>hours, and worse working conditions in order to compete with </p><p>China.  He then said that poverty would not be reduced unless </p><p>the worker received a living wage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Nigeria\'s Corruption </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Oshiomhole blamed much of Nigeria\'s corruption on 16 </p><p>years of military rule, saying military leaders bloated the </p><p>civil service with unmotivated workers.  Under current </p><p>economic conditions, he stated, "These people cannot live on </p><p>their wages, which breeds corruption." The civil service </p><p>consumes an estimated 67% of the GON\'s annual budget, he </p><p>said.  He then chided the Obasanjo Administration, which set </p><p>ambitious economic goals in 1999, but like its military </p><p>predecessors, had sapped the economy\'s potential for growth </p><p>through over-reliance on oil exports.  The GON failed to </p><p>jumpstart the non-oil sector, he chided.  The NLC President </p><p>said the GON had also failed to address the problems of low </p><p>worker productivity, under-investment from abroad, corruption </p><p>and private sector inertia.  The Ambassador asked whether </p><p>former military ruler Ibrahim Babangida was labor friendly. </p><p>Oshiomhole responded that Nigerian politicians are devious. </p><p>No leader really looked at what would be "good democracy." </p><p>He then said that Obasanjo, like Babangida, acknowledged </p><p>fraud and corruption but did nothing about it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Corruption: No End to Parallel Market </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador then asked what Oshiomhole thought of </p><p>the IMF\'s Nigeria program, particularly its call for </p><p>harmonizing the AFEM (official) and parallel market exchange </p><p>rates.  Oshiomhole thought the GON would not eliminate the </p><p>parallel currency market because many in government were </p><p>getting rich by manipulating it.  Oshiomhole said Nigerian </p><p>ministries often withhold salary payments for months to </p><p>enrich themselves by moving money in and out of the parallel </p><p>market or simply collecting the interest from the money.  By </p><p>the time the civil servant gets paid, unscrupulous </p><p>businessmen and many GON officials have earned considerable </p><p>sums from that worker\'s salary, he stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Corruption: Too Much Overhead </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Government officials, high-ranking civil servants, and </p><p>National Assembly Members bill millions of Naira in overhead </p><p>to the GON, said Oshiomhole.  This scheme too is not </p><p>complicated; the official travels to Lagos or New York and </p><p>collects thousands of dollars in per diem, charging lavish </p><p>hotel rooms and even family travel to the GON.  The National </p><p>Assembly is especially adept at allocating money to specious </p><p>activities, he commented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>The NLC View on Privatization </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Oshiomhole said that the GON should privatize NITEL </p><p>and NEPA because they had failed as public utilities. </p><p>Nigeria must have functioning telephones and electricity; </p><p>otherwise, the cost of doing business is too high for the </p><p>country to become competitive and workers will suffer as a </p><p>result.  However, the NLC had strong reservations about </p><p>privatizing NNPC because of the revenue it generates for the </p><p>public interest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>NLC\'s Evolving Policy Agenda </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Oshiomhole listed many NLC advocacy programs: child </p><p>labor awareness campaign, worker capacity-building, living </p><p>wages and proper working conditions, and a government </p><p>transparency campaign.  Oshiomhole stated that most in the </p><p>GON misunderstood the NLC\'s goals, seeing the union as an </p><p>adversary not as a partner.  The NLC President said the union </p><p>was largely apolitical, but added that it would support the </p><p>Presidential candidate best for workers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The Ambassador asked why the NLC had pushed the GON </p><p>for a 25% pay increase in September, but accepted a 12.5% </p><p>increase starting January 1, 2003, a move which the </p><p>Ambassador commended as rational given Nigeria\'s economic </p><p>situation. Oshiomhole agreed strongly that the deal was good </p><p>given the GON\'s current economic constraints. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT: The GON\'s economic blueprint for 2003-2007 </p><p>aims to downsize the civil service and pay its workers </p><p>competitive salaries to boost productivity and curb recurrent </p><p>expenditures.  In late December, President Obasanjo said he </p><p>would not grant civil servants a 12.5% pay increase. </p><p>Oshiomhole, in turn, has repeatedly stated that workers would </p><p>attempt to "make the country ungovernable" (i.e., attempt a </p><p>general strike) if the 12.5% pay rise were not implemented in </p><p>2003.  The GON is in a difficult position; if it grants the </p><p>pay raise, Nigeria\'s finances will be even more confused; if </p><p>not, the country might experience sporadic strikes during an </p><p>already politically tense time.  The NLC\'s National </p><p>Conference comes up in a few weeks and the 12.5% pay increase </p><p>is likely to be the centerpiece of its deliberations and </p><p>possible calls for a strike action by NLC workers nation- </p><p>wide.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>No Fuel Cost Increase Strikes </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) The Ambassador inquired why the January 2002 fuel </p><p>strike had fizzled.  Oshiomhole said the NLC had the public\'s </p><p>support and thought the strike was effective.  The NLC </p><p>judged, however, that it was more important to maintain the </p><p>rule of law, instead of extending the strike, he claimed. </p><p>Oshiomhole said that the situation was tricky, and the NLC </p><p>gave the GON a viable option.  The NLC leader said he </p><p>suggested that the GON not raise prices but instead let fuel </p><p>prices drop, so that people could see a real commitment by </p><p>Abuja to the people.  He said the NLC would have not have </p><p>struck if fuel prices rose slowly instead of the steep </p><p>increase the GON proposed.  The GON did not accept his deal. </p><p>13. (U) NOTE: In January 2002, Oshiomhole had led a two-day </p><p>nation-wide strike protesting the GON\'s hike in fuel prices. </p><p>After a Nigerian court ruled that the strike was illegal and </p><p>Oshiomhole and several others were briefly arrested, support </p><p>for the strike quickly fizzled.  Disinterest and general </p><p>apathy forced the NLC to call off the strike action, but it </p><p>cited "respect for the law" as the reason.  The price </p><p>increase stood. END NOTE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Oshiomhole said the NLC had learned a lesson that in </p><p>embarrassing Obasanjo with the strike, the President was less </p><p>willing to engage in dialogue.  He said that Obasanjo was </p><p>increasingly temperamental and lacked trust in the NLC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Honored and Humbled </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) Oshiomhole thanked the Ambassador for the USG\'s </p><p>considerable support for the NLC. Oshiomhole stated that he </p><p>was "honored and humbled" by a recent USG-sponsored visit to </p><p>the U.S. and especially appreciated meetings with U.S. labor </p><p>organizations.  He said that the NLC had been an alliance </p><p>with the AFL-CIO, and added that the NLC had signed an </p><p>agreement with the Carter Center. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>NLC: One of Nigeria\'s Only National Institutions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) COMMENT: The frank, well-spoken and well-traveled </p><p>Oshiomhole was confident and on top of his brief during the </p><p>meeting.  Some of Oshiomhole\'s arguments, however, seemed </p><p>disingenuous; for example, he argued for higher wages while </p><p>refusing to acknowledge that Nigerians need to work harder </p><p>and longer hours to compete in the international market.  He </p><p>also bristled at times, especially when asked about his arrest </p><p>in January 2002. Despite labor\'s weaknesses, Oshiomhole draws </p><p>considerable influence from the fact that he heads one of the </p><p>only truly national institutions that claim membership across </p><p>the country, transcending ethnic, regional and religious </p><p>divides. If the GON refuses to meet the NLC\'s pay-raise </p><p>demands in 2003, Oshiomhole and the NLC might feel compelled </p><p>to call strikes and stoppages.  While understandable from the </p><p>NLC\'s perspective, such action could raise political tension </p><p>at a time when political activity will already be frenetic in </p><p>the lead up to the general elections in April.  In the past </p><p>Oshiomhole and President Obasanjo have been close, with </p><p>frequent informal discussions behind closed doors. Obasanjo </p><p>will need Oshiomhole for his current bid for a return to Aso </p><p>Rock.  END COMMENT </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
