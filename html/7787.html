<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BRASILIA 001356 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/BSC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, BR </p><p>SUBJECT: MAGALHAES WIRETAPPING CASE GOES TO SENATE FLOOR </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. BRASILIA 0566 </p><p>     B. BRASILIA 0825 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  On April 30, the leadership of the </p><p>Brazilian Senate refused to order the opening of expulsion </p><p>proceedings against Senator Antonio Carlos Magalhaes (PFL) </p><p>for allegedly ordering hundreds of illegal phone taps against </p><p>his political opponents in his home state of Bahia.  The </p><p>decision by the leadership, led by Magalhaes\' ally Jose </p><p>Sarney, was not unexpected and kicks the case back to the </p><p>Senate floor.  Magalhaes\' legal and ethics problems are far </p><p>from over, and with political winds buffeting each step of </p><p>the way, it is too early to say whether the Senator will </p><p>suffer punishment or "have a pizza" and skate away unscathed. </p><p> In any case, Magalhaes\' popularity is unshaken in Bahia. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The ethics case of Senator Antonio Carlos Magalhaes </p><p>("ACM"), the powerful political boss from Bahia, ground </p><p>forward this week as the seven-member Senate leadership </p><p>board, led by Senate President and longtime ACM ally Jose </p><p>Sarney (PMDB-Amapa), refused to order the opening of </p><p>expulsion proceedings in the Senate\'s Ethics Committee.  This </p><p>decision is part of the torturous path that the case has </p><p>followed since exploding in the national press in January. </p><p>The case began in late 2001, a few months after Magalhaes </p><p>resigned from the Senate for an unrelated earlier ethics </p><p>violation.  He then allegedly ordered more than 200 illegal </p><p>phone taps of his political enemies as well as the </p><p>wiretapping and harassment of a young woman who broke off a </p><p>relationship with him (reftels).  He was reelected to the </p><p>Senate in October 2002. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The case unfolded in public after Magalhaes took </p><p>some of the juicier tidbits that he learned through the </p><p>wiretaps to the press in order to smear his enemies.  The </p><p>Senate Ethics Committee, prodded by the victims of the </p><p>wiretaps and the radical wing of the PT party, then opened a </p><p>preliminary investigation.  Last week, after several weeks of </p><p>hearing witnesses and reviewing the police report, the </p><p>Committee voted 8 to 7 to recommend opening formal expulsion </p><p>proceedings.  This recommendation went to the Senate </p><p>leadership board led by Senate President Sarney for a </p><p>decision.  In a hurried meeting late on April 30, the </p><p>leadership voted 5 to 2 to reject the recommendation.  While </p><p>the voting, both in the Ethics Committee and the leadership </p><p>board, followed expected party lines, the leadership sought </p><p>to justify its decision not to open expulsion proceedings by </p><p>announcing that ACM should receive only a reprimand for the </p><p>ethics violation, while the criminal charges would be decided </p><p>by the Supreme Court once the police finish their </p><p>investigation. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Given the party makeup of the leadership board and </p><p>Sarney\'s views, the April 30 decision was not unexpected, and </p><p>it does not kill the chance that ACM will be expelled.  Under </p><p>congressional rules, the full Senate can vote to override the </p><p>leadership\'s decision, and PT party leader Tiao Viana has </p><p>promised to introduce such a motion in the coming days. </p><p>There is no certainty that a motion to force expulsion </p><p>proceedings will pass on the floor.  A preliminary count puts </p><p>about 30 Senators for and 30 against, with about 20 still in </p><p>play.  If the motion does not pass, the ethics case against </p><p>ACM will come to a close, likely with some sort of minor </p><p>reprimand.  The police investigation is ongoing and could, at </p><p>least theoretically, lead to a court conviction. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) But if the floor motion passes, then the Ethics </p><p>Committee would open formal proceedings, at which point ACM </p><p>would no longer have the option of resigning his seat to keep </p><p>his political rights.  The Ethics Committee has already voted </p><p>against ACM once, and given the weight of evidence made </p><p>public, it is conceivable that he could be expelled from the </p><p>Senate and stripped him of the right to run for public office </p><p>for eight years.  But the denouement is months down the road, </p><p>and ACM and his allies will use every political and </p><p>parliamentary trick to keep him in the Senate. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT.  Though diminished, Magalhaes remains one </p><p>of Brazil\'s most powerful figures.  He has dominated the </p><p>state of Bahia and the national PFL party for nearly five </p><p>decades, and recent polling shows that his popularity remains </p><p>intact in the state.  The fact that months after the </p><p>revelation that he masterminded an enormous wiretapping </p><p>scheme and mercilessly harassed a young woman who broke off a </p><p>romance with him, the Senate is still dithering over whether </p><p>to even open ethics proceedings is testimony to the </p><p>complicated political expedience that dominates the Brazilian </p><p>congress.  Those in ACM\'s camp --the PFL plus many in the </p><p>PMDB and PSDB parties-- are working overtime to stall or </p><p>shelve the proceedings.  Meanwhile, the PT has been </p><p>surprisingly ambivalent.  Leading PT Senator Aloizio </p><p>Mercadante alternately speaks of the importance of political </p><p>probity and of the need to keep the Senate agenda free of </p><p>distractions.  The PT is surely calculating that ACM, who </p><p>supported Lula in the 2002 elections, will be key to passing </p><p>the administration\'s high-stakes pension and tax reform bills </p><p>that went to Congress this week. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) In the Brazilian political lexicon, a corrupt </p><p>politician who escapes punishment is said to be having a </p><p>pizza.  Pundits are now running recipes for vatapa pizza </p><p>(vatapa being a traditional Bahian dish).  It is widely </p><p>accepted that ACM did what he is accused of doing.  Even the </p><p>lead police investigator commented, "Every street vendor in </p><p>Bahia knows who ordered the wiretaps."  The question is </p><p>whether he will have to pay the price for his actions. </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
