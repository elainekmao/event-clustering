<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 002241 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR OUSD-P/ISP/TSPCP/CTR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: TBIO, MARR, MASS, AMED, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY MOVES CLOSER TO ACCEPTING OFFER TO ACQUIRE </p><p>ANTHRAX VACCINES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 58805 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1955 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Economic Counselor Scot A. Marciel. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) We have received a faxed letter (4/3) from MFA advising </p><p>that the Turkish Government plans to use unobligated FY 2002 </p><p>FMF to finance the acquisition of 10,000 doses (only) of </p><p>anthrax vaccine.  The letter requests confirmation on the </p><p>availability of the vaccine, date and delivery logistics, and </p><p>other related information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The MFA letter indicated the amount of $230,310 for </p><p>the acquisition, a figure that M. Turker Ari, MFA First </p><p>Secretary, says came from the Turkish General Staff. EconOff </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>pointed out that our respective military colleagues would </p><p>ultimately handle the transaction but that the MFA letter </p><p>quoted an outdated price, neglected to reference </p><p>transportation and administrative costs, and omitted any </p><p>reference to previous requests for training for healthcare </p><p>providers.  Ari said he would meet with the TGS </p><p>representatives on 4/8 to discuss pricing and training issues </p><p>and would return to us with a final decision tomorrow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT. We understand that there are more than </p><p>sufficient funds available in Turkey\'s FMF account to cover </p><p>an updated anthrax vaccine estimate, transportation and </p><p>administrative costs and training and are relatively </p><p>optimistic that the deal will go through.  We will continue </p><p>to follow up and report. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
