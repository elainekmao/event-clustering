<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001203 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB, EB/TRA </p><p>ROME FOR FAA </p><p>PARIS FOR TSA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ASEC, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AIRLINES EXPECT DROP IN BOOKINGS/PROFITS WITH IRAQ </p><p>OPERATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Turkish Airlines (THY) and Delta Airlines </p><p>Istanbul Office are concerned about the impact of a potential </p><p>Iraq war on their operations.  THY expects that bookings on </p><p>flights to the U.S., Europe, and the Far East, as well as </p><p>domestic flights, will drop considerably.  Delta is preparing </p><p>for a possible shut-down of its Istanbul office.  Both </p><p>airlines expect a decrease in profits for their Turkey </p><p>operations in 2003.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Head of Marketing for Turkish Airlines Guliz Ozturk </p><p>told econoff February 20 that THY expected a significant </p><p>decrease in international and domestic operations due to a </p><p>possible Iraq operation.  THY is currently running 10 flights </p><p>per week to the U.S. -- 7 days a week to New York, and 3 days </p><p>a week to Chicago.  Ozturk said she expected that travel by </p><p>Turkish nationals to/from the U.S. would not change </p><p>significantly, but other tourism and business travel could </p><p>drop considerably.  THY hoped it would not have to cut any of </p><p>its U.S. flights, but would reevaluate its decision based on </p><p>bookings.  Ozturk expected that flights to and from the Far </p><p>East would take the biggest hit, noting that THY already had </p><p>decided to cut its Japan flights from 7x/week to 4x/week. </p><p>She said THY also anticipated a significant drop in bookings </p><p>on THY,s European flights, with the exception of travel by </p><p>Turkish nationals to/from Germany. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Ozkurk said THY was also concerned about its </p><p>domestic operations to the eastern and southeastern Turkey, </p><p>particularly to Adana, Diyarbakir, and Erzerum.  She noted </p><p>that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to keep </p><p>aircraft and crews overnight in these cities once an </p><p>operation began.  Ozkurk said the likely negative impact on </p><p>THY,s profits was particularly distressing given the </p><p>airline,s efforts in 2002.  Despite 9/11, increased </p><p>insurance costs, and an economic crisis, 2002 had been THY,s </p><p>most profitable year since 1996.  An Iraq operation would </p><p>make it difficult to achieve such profit levels again in </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Delta Airlines Istanbul Station Manager Giray </p><p>Salgirtay told econoff he was preparing for a possible </p><p>shut-down of the Istanbul office in the case of an Iraq </p><p>operation.  Salgirtay noted that Delta currently runs four </p><p>flights/week from Istanbul to New York.  Although he hoped </p><p>flights would continue at the current level, it was likely </p><p>they would decrease -- or cease -- at least temporarily </p><p>during an Iraq operation.  Salgirtay noted that, prior to </p><p>9/11, the Turkey office had been one of Delta,s most </p><p>profitable international operations.  However, business had </p><p>decreased due to September 11 and the subsequent war in </p><p>Afghanistan, causing the Turkey operation to barely break </p><p>even in 2002.  Salgirtay said that most summer tours and </p><p>cruises booked from February to April; therefore, he soon </p><p>would have a better idea of how concerns about an Iraq </p><p>operation would affect bookings. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
