<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 009630 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, XI, XF, LY, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: LIBYA: QADHAFI HOPES IN ITALY\'S LEFTISTS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ROME 9519 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE ITALIAN PRESS CONTINUES TO REPORT ON </p><p>LIBYA, CITING QADHAFI AS SAYING OCTOBER 29 HE </p><p>BELIEVES ITALY\'S LEFTIST GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE </p><p>NO PROBLEM WITH APPROVING INDEMNITY PAYMENTS TO </p><p>LIBYA AS COMPENSATION FOR ITALIAN COLONIAL </p><p>DAMAGES.  THREE PROMINENT FIGURES, FORMERLY </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE THEN-ITALIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCI) </p><p>RESPONDED PUBLICLY AND POSITIVELY TO QADHAFI\'S </p><p>REQUESTS:  ACHILLE OCCHETTO, PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES\' FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>COMMITTEE, FORMER PCI LEADER, AND CURRENTLY A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE LEADING GOVERNING PARTY, THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF THE LEFT (PDS);  RINO SERRI, </p><p>MFA UNDER SECRETARY, FORMERLY OF THE PCI AND NOW </p><p>A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNING COALITION\'S UNITARIAN </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY;  AND VALENTINO PARLATO, EDITOR </p><p>OF THE LEFTIST DAILY "IL MANIFESTO."  HOWEVER, </p><p>SENATOR JAS GAWRONSKI OF THE CENTER-RIGHT\'S FORZA </p><p>ITALIA SAID LIBYA CAN NORMALIZE ITS RELATIONS </p><p>WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY "ONLY IF IT </p><p>COMPLIES WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND COOPERATES </p><p>POSITIVELY IN FINDING A SOLUTION ON LOCKERBIE." </p><p>A DELEGATION OF RELATIVES OF LIBYANS DEPORTED </p><p>DURING ITALY\'S OCCUPATION VISITED ITALY AT THE </p><p>END OF OCTOBER AND SUBMITTED A LIST OF REQUESTS </p><p>TO THE GOI.  UNIDENTIFIED ITALIAN MFA SOURCES </p><p>TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE SIGNING OF AN </p><p>ITALIAN-LIBYAN AGREEMENT "IS GETTING CLOSER." </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>QADHAFI CALLS ON THE ITALIAN LEFT </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOLLOWING LIBYA\'S "NATIONAL DAY OF MOURNING" </p><p>IN COMMEMORATION OF THE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND </p><p>LIBYANS QADHAFI CLAIMS WERE DEPORTED TO ITALY ON </p><p>OCTOBER 26, 1911, THE ITALIAN NEWS SERVICE ANSA </p><p>REPORTED THAT QADHAFI OCTOBER 29 SAID HE HOPED </p><p>THE NEW ITALIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD SETTLE THE </p><p>CONTROVERSY OVER COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES </p><p>PROVOKED BY ITALY DURING ITALY\'S OCCUPATION OF </p><p>LIBYA (1911-1943).  SPECIFICALLY, QADHAFI SAID, </p><p>"INDEMNITY PAYMENTS SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM TO </p><p>THE COMMUNISTS AND THE LEFT NOW IN GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>ITALY.  IT IS TIME TO TURN OVER A DARK PAGE, </p><p>START COOPERATING, AND FORGET THE UGLY PAST.  IF </p><p>WE GET COMPENSATION, WE PROMISE WE WILL GIVE </p><p>ITALY TRUE FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION."  HE ALSO </p><p>SAID HE BELIEVES ITALY "WILL SUPPORT LIBYA\'S </p><p>POSITION ON LOCKERBIE, AS WILL OTHER EUROPEAN </p><p>COUNTRIES." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OCCHETTO SAYS ITALIAN COLONIALISM "A BLEMISH" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  QADHAFI SEEMED TO BE RESPONDING TO STATEMENTS </p><p>BY ACHILLE OCCHETTO, PRESIDENT OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES\' FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE </p><p>(AND FORMER ITALIAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADER). </p><p>INTERVIEWED ON ITALIAN NATIONAL RADIO THE </p><p>PREVIOUS DAY, OCCHETTO HAD STRESSED THE "TIES </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN" AND </p><p>COMMENTED POSITIVELY ON THE GOI\'S EFFORTS TO </p><p>NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH LIBYA (REFTEL). </p><p>ACCORDING TO OCCHETTO, QADHAFI\'S REPEATED </p><p>REQUESTS FOR INDEMNITY PAYMENTS APPEAR TO BE </p><p>"EXAGGERATED."  HOWEVER, OCCHETTO SAID, ITALIAN </p><p>COLONIALISM WAS A "BLEMISH [ON ITALY\'S PAST].  IT </p><p>WAS ITALY\'S MISTAKE, AND ITALY MUST RECOGNIZE </p><p>IT."  OCCHETTO DID NOT SEEM TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>POSSIBLE U.S. DISCONTENT OVER ITALY\'S EFFORTS. </p><p>HE SAID, "THE POLICY OF DIALOGUE WITH COUNTRIES </p><p>OVER WHICH THE U.S. HAS PLACED SOME SORT OF VETO </p><p>CAN BE MUCH MORE USEFUL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY THAN THE POLICY OF </p><p>ISOLATION." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SERRI SAYS QADHAFI\'S REQUESTS ARE "LEGITIMATE" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>4.  QADHAFI\'S REQUESTS RECEIVED POSITIVE, PUBLIC </p><p>RESPONSES FROM TWO OTHER AUTHORITATIVE ITALIAN </p><p>NEO-COMMUNISTS -- ONE OF WHOM, RINO SERRI, IS </p><p>CURRENTLY UNDER SECRETARY AT THE MFA.  IN AN OPEN </p><p>LETTER IN THE ITALIAN COMMUNIST DAILY "IL </p><p>MANIFESTO"  NOVEMBER 2, SERRI CHARACTERIZED </p><p>QADHAFI\'S REQUEST FOR ITALY\'S CONDEMNATION OF ITS </p><p>COLONIAL PERIOD AS "LEGITIMATE," ADDING THAT </p><p>ITALY SHOULD "REMOVE EVERY VESTIGE OF ITS </p><p>COLONIAL PAST IN LIBYA."  ACCORDING TO SERRI, </p><p>"ITALY MUST CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR LIBYA TO </p><p>COME OUT OF ITS ISOLATION" THROUGH THE </p><p>EURO-MEDITERRANEAN PARTNERSHIP, WHICH, HE SAID, </p><p>"CANNOT GROW WITHOUT LIBYA\'S FULL </p><p>PARTICIPATION."  HE NOTED THAT "MEDITERRANEAN </p><p>PEACE, SECURITY, AND PROGRESS" ARE INCREASINGLY </p><p>BECOMING ISSUES REQUIRING FULL COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN, AND </p><p>UNDERSCORED LIBYA\'S STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION, </p><p>INCLUDING ITS CALL FOR ARAB UNIFICATION AGAINST </p><p>ISLAMIC TERRORISM.  SERRI SAID ITALIAN PM PRODI\'S </p><p>CENTER-LEFT GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WORKING SINCE </p><p>SUMMER 1996 TO "BEGIN A NEW AND POSITIVE PERIOD </p><p>IN LIBYAN-ITALIAN RELATIONS."  ACCORDING TO </p><p>SERRI, "THIS IS THE WAY TO MAKE IT EASIER ONE DAY </p><p>TO OVERCOME" THE U.N. EMBARGO AGAINST LIBYA, </p><p>"WHICH ALL OF US SHOULD HOPE WILL NOT LAST TOO </p><p>MUCH LONGER."  SERRI\'S COMMENT WAS IN REPLY TO AN </p><p>OPEN LETTER IN THE SAME PAPER OCTOBER 31 BY </p><p>VALENTINO PARLATO, "MANIFESTO" EDITOR AND </p><p>POLITICAL COMMENTATOR (AND A NATIVE OF TRIPOLI), </p><p>WHO ENCOURAGED SERRI "TO REACH A PEACEFUL </p><p>SOLUTION WITH ITALY\'S FORMER COLONY." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FORZA ITALIA SAYS REMEMBER LOCKERBIE </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  QADHAFI\'S REQUESTS SPARKED A DIAMETRICALLY </p><p>OPPOSITE REACTION FROM JAS GAWRONSKI, </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT FORZA ITALIA\'S GROUP LEADER AT THE </p><p>SENATE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>GAWRONSKI, LIBYA CAN NORMALIZE ITS RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY "ONLY IF IT COMPLIES </p><p>WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND COOPERATES POSITIVELY </p><p>IN FINDING A SOLUTION ON LOCKERBIE."  IF THE GOI </p><p>WERE TO IGNORE THE ABOVE, GAWRONSKI SAID, IT </p><p>WOULD "OPEN A VERY DIFFICULT PERIOD IN ITALY\'S </p><p>TRADITIONAL RELATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE U.S. </p><p>AND WITH ALL THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ALWAYS </p><p>STRUGGLED AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND ITS </p><p>RAMIFICATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>LIBYAN DELEGATION IN ITALY </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE PRESS OCTOBER 28-29 ALSO REPORTED THE </p><p>LATE-OCTOBER YEARLY VISIT TO ITALY BY A </p><p>DELEGATION OF RELATIVES OF THOSE LIBYANS WHO WERE </p><p>ALLEGEDLY DEPORTED HERE, AND THEIR YEARLY </p><p>REQUESTS TO THE GOI FOR: </p><p> </p><p>--  MAPS INDICATING THE PLACEMENT OF </p><p>ANTI-PERSONNEL LAND MINES; </p><p> </p><p>--  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO REMOVE THE LAND MINES; </p><p> </p><p>--  MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE WHO WERE INJURED </p><p>OR CRIPPLED BY LAND MINE EXPLOSIONS;  AND </p><p> </p><p>--  COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOI READYING ITALY-LIBYA AGREEMENT </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  ACCORDING TO THE PROVOCATIVE, CLASSICAL </p><p>LIBERAL DAILY "IL FOGLIO" OCTOBER 31 AND NOVEMBER </p><p>6, UNIDENTIFIED ITALIAN MFA SOURCES SAID THAT THE </p><p>SIGNING OF AN ITALIAN-LIBYAN BILATERAL AGREEMENT </p><p>(THAT WILL ALSO SETTLE PENDING COLONIAL ISSUES) </p><p>"IS GETTING CLOSER."  ACCORDING TO "IL FOGLIO," </p><p>THE AGREEMENT WOULD OPEN THE WAY FOR </p><p>"CONSIDERABLE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE ENERGY AND </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS, BUT WOULD MOST CERTAINLY </p><p>PROVOKE U.S. RESENTMENT."  THIS NOTWITHSTANDING, </p><p>"IL FOGLIO" NOTED THAT UNIDENTIFIED GOI SOURCES </p><p>INDICATED THAT ITALY "WANTS TO MOVE THE SAME WAY </p><p>AS FRANCE DID IN IRAN WITH ITS \'TOTAL\' </p><p>MAXI-CONTRACT." </p><p> </p><p></p><p>CUNNINGHAM </p><p></p></div>
