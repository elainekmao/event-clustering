The violent Ijaw confrontations of the </p><p>Itsekiri in the oil-rich Escravos area result from their </p><p>fierce political competition to control the South-west Warri </p><p>Local Government.  The chairmanship of this local government </p><p>is seen as a lynchpin to the Ijaw\'s economic survival.  If </p><p>their demands are not met, the Ijaw intend to keep fighting </p><p>to disrupt the April 12 local elections.  Although the Ijaw\'s </p><p>stated target is neither the oil companies nor the Federal </p><p>Government, ethnic dimensions of outside groups color the </p><p>Ijaws\' views of Niger Delta politics and the larger polity. </p><p>Among the many stakes in the crisis is the legitimacy of the </p><p>election outcome.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>IJAW MOTIVATIONS & INTENT TO DISRUPT LOCAL ELECTIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Joshua Fumodoh (strictly protect), former president </p><p>of the Ijaw National Congress, confirms that Ijaw youths </p><p>intend to "correct the anomaly" of the distribution of wards </p><p>in the South-west Warri Local Government of Delta State "by </p><p>any means necessary" before local elections take place.  Oil </p><p>companies are not the target.  The target is strictly the </p><p>balance of political power between Ijaw and Itsekiri, the two </p><p>main riverine groups of the area.  The Ijaw regard themselves </p><p>as the majority ethnic group in this area and the Itsekiri as </p><p>a minority group.  Under redistricting enacted after the 1999 </p><p>elections, 6 of the 10 wards of this local government were </p><p>demarcated to the Itsekiri, according to Fumodoh.  The Ijaw </p><p>view the chairmanship to the local government as paramount to </p><p>allocating government revenue, and they see government as the </p><p>region\'s sole means of economic resources outside of the oil </p><p>industry.  The Ijaw see attaining the local government </p><p>chairmanship as a life-or-death issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>IJAW AND NIGER DELTA ETHNIC POLITICS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The Ijaw do not think President Obasanjo is a neutral </p><p>actor in the crisis, due in part to his Yoruba ethnic </p><p>heritage.  The Ijaw believe the Itsekiri are actually Yoruba </p><p>affiliates, saying the Itsekiri actually "speak Yoruba with </p><p>an accent."  Fumudoh says, "Despite Obasanjo\'s style to </p><p>appear indifferent and aloof regarding all conflict </p><p>situations, we believe he feels strongly about these issues </p><p>on the inside.  All the Ijaw want is for the president to be </p><p>fair.  We see him as siding with the Itsekiri, though he </p><p>covers up his true feelings through his official language." </p><p>This belief was further fueled over the weekend of March </p><p>22-23 by reports of press statements given by Afenifere and </p><p>the Yoruba Council of Elders (traditional Yoruba political </p><p>interest groups) condemning the Ijaw\'s moves against the </p><p>Itsekiri.  Fumodoh said the reports indicate that Yoruba </p><p>groups would "take up arms against the Ijaw" if the fighting </p><p>does not end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) As discussed in ref B, the Army Chief of Staff is </p><p>regarded by the Ijaw as a member of the Isoko ethnic group, a </p><p>subset of the Urhobo group.  Fumodoh says the Urhobo, as a </p><p>mainland and not riverine ethnic group, are generally seen as </p><p>neutral and outside this conflict between Ijaw and Itsekiri </p><p>(septel will explain complexities and contradictions of this </p><p>issue).  Delta State Governor James Ibori is generally </p><p>respected by the Ijaw as a peace-maker for his former roles </p><p>in the ethnic conflict, although his mother is Itsekiri and </p><p>his father Urhobo (septel to follow on Warri-Niger Delta </p><p>politics). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT.  Although the Ijaw may outnumber the </p><p>Itsekiri nation-wide, Fumudoh has previously conceded to </p><p>poloffs that the Ijaw constituency\'s status within a </p><p>geopolitical area depends heavily on the boundary </p><p>demarcations.  Gerrymandering directly impacts Ijaw political </p><p>power.  The Ijaw believe that oil production has disrupted </p><p>their traditional means of economic sustenance (i.e. </p><p>fishing), and that government provides their only alternate </p><p>means of survival.  Until a third option of viable private </p><p>sector employment develops in their region, or until the </p><p>spoils of power are seen by constituents as being distributed </p><p>among minority and majority groups alike, the Ijaw are </p><p>unlikely to end their quest for political power by any means </p><p>necessary.  At risk are lives, long-term stability for oil </p><p>production, property, and the legitimacy of local government </p><p>elections in the Niger Delta.  END COMMENT. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
