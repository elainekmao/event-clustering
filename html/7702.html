<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001108 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NP/CBM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, MNUC, ETTC, TSPA, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: GUATEMALA STILL STUDYING BALLISTIC MISSILE ICOC </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 89910 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 02 GUATEMALA 2889 </p><p> </p><p>PolOff raised ref A points with Sylvia Corado, Director for </p><p>Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign Ministry (MFA) on April </p><p>25.  Corado said the MFA remains interested in subscribing to </p><p>the International Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile </p><p>Proliferation (ICOC), and hopes to do so in time to </p><p>participate in the June meeting on implementation issues and </p><p>confidence building measures.  Corado explained that the MFA </p><p>had not responded to our earlier demarche (ref B), because </p><p>paragraph 3 (a) of the ICOC requires subscribers to "ratify, </p><p>accede to, or otherwise abide by" the terms of three treaties </p><p>related to outer space.  Corado admitted the MFA has very </p><p>little expertise in this area and needed to be sure it </p><p>understood what it was signing.  Corado stressed that </p><p>Guatemala supports the goal of non-proliferation. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
