Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The fourth round of talks between the </p><p>GSL and the Tamil Tigers is set to take place in </p><p>Thailand, January 6-9.  Topics on the agenda include the </p><p>security zones in Jaffna, which the Tigers want reduced </p><p>in size.  There is still some confusion as to the exact </p><p>nature of Muslim representation at the talks.  In other </p><p>news, President Kumaratunga has sent a letter to Norway </p><p>critical of its role in the recent import of radio </p><p>equipment for the Tigers.  Both the GSL and LTTE seem </p><p>keen to keep up the momentum of the peace process, but </p><p>it is not clear whether this set of talks will lead to </p><p>any breakthroughs.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>================= </p><p>Talks in Thailand </p><p>================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The fourth round of talks between the Sri Lankan </p><p>government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) is set to take place in Thailand, January 6-9. </p><p>(Note:  The last round of talks took place in Oslo in </p><p>early December.  The previous two rounds took place in </p><p>Thailand in September and November.)  The venue will be </p><p>the Rose Garden Hotel in the Bangkok area. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Agenda:  Neither the Norwegian government </p><p>facilitators nor the parties have issued a detailed </p><p>agenda for the talks.  In public statements this week, </p><p>however, GSL and LTTE officials announced that the issue </p><p>of how to handle the Sri Lankan military\'s "high </p><p>security zones" will be one of the key matters under </p><p>discussion.  (Note:  Per Ref B, the LTTE has demanded </p><p>that the government reduce the size of its security </p><p>zones in Jaffna.  Before agreeing to this, the military </p><p>has set conditions, including that the LTTE disarm any </p><p>cadre entering the areas.  The LTTE rejected this </p><p>proposal.)  According to reports, another important </p><p>agenda item is the issue of federalism and what sort of </p><p>federal model could be developed that would meet with </p><p>the approval of the two sides.  (Note:  At the last </p><p>round of talks in December, the LTTE -- in a major </p><p>breakthrough -- agreed that it would work toward </p><p>creation of a federal system in Sri Lanka.)  Government </p><p>sources have also said additional items on the agenda </p><p>include:  humanitarian assistance for the north and </p><p>east; and human rights issues related to LTTE-controlled </p><p>areas. </p><p> </p><p>==================================== </p><p>Muslim Representation Still an Issue </p><p>==================================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Both sides\' delegations to the talks are </p><p>basically the same as for previous rounds.  Members of </p><p>the GSL team include senior ministers G.L. Peiris and </p><p>Milinda Moragoda, and chief of the Peace Secretariat </p><p>Ambassador Bernard Goonetilleke.  Because security zone </p><p>issues are due for discussion, Defense Secretary Austin </p><p>Fernando and military representatives are also slated to </p><p>join the GSL team.  Members of the LTTE team include </p><p>senior negotiator Anton Balasingham, Adele Balasingham </p><p>(wife of Anton), LTTE political chief S.P. </p><p>Tahmilchelvam, and LTTE eastern military commander </p><p>Karuna. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) There is still some confusion as to the exact </p><p>nature of Muslim representation.  Late last week, the </p><p>government announced that Sri Lanka Muslim Congress </p><p>(SLMC) leader and senior minister Rauf Hakeem would once </p><p>again join the GSL team.  This led to a cacophony of </p><p>criticism from Hakeem\'s many political opponents in the </p><p>SLMC and the Muslim community at large.  The critics </p><p>asserted that the government should not allow Hakeem on </p><p>the GSL team because he was not "a true representative" </p><p>of Sri Lanka\'s Muslims.  Another point made was that </p><p>Muslims should form their own team at the talks and not </p><p>be included on the government\'s team.  Stung by the </p><p>criticism, Hakeem demanded that the GSL and the LTTE </p><p>allow him to represent Sri Lanka\'s Muslims as a third </p><p>party at the talks.  As of today, January 3, Hakeem\'s </p><p>request has not been granted and the issue of Muslim </p><p>representation still is up in the air, although Hakeem </p><p>reportedly will be at the talks in some capacity. </p><p> </p><p>=========================== </p><p>Kumaratunga Hits Out at GoN </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In other peace process-related developments: </p><p>As foreshadowed in Ref B, President Kumaratunga has sent </p><p>the Norwegian Prime Minister a letter criticizing GoN </p><p>involvement in the recent import of radio equipment for </p><p>the Tigers.  The letter, which has been faxed to SA/INS, </p><p>received extensive press play in Sri Lanka after the </p><p>President\'s Office issued it as a press release on </p><p>January 1. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The letter, which was respectful in tone, </p><p>asserted that the Norwegian Embassy acted improperly in </p><p>allowing the radio equipment to be sent to it as a </p><p>diplomatic consignment that could not be assessed </p><p>customs duties.  (Note:  The embassy only agreed to do </p><p>this after it received a specific request from the GSL </p><p>on the matter.)  The letter went on to state that the </p><p>embassy\'s actions raised "serious questions about the </p><p>impartiality of the Royal Norwegian government in </p><p>relation to the negotiations."  The letter did not ask </p><p>the GoN to remove Ambassador Jon Westborg from his post, </p><p>although some anti-peace process elements have publicly </p><p>agitated for just that.  The letter did note that the </p><p>GoN should appreciate the "seriousness" of Westborg\'s </p><p>actions, however.  When asked about Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>letter, Taranjit Sandhu, the polchief of the Indian High </p><p>Commission, told us that he thought the letter was </p><p>basically a way for Kumaratunga to show hard-liners in </p><p>her party that she was doing something in reaction to </p><p>their complaints. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Despite the recent disagreement about the </p><p>security zones, both sides seem keen to keep up the </p><p>momentum of the peace process.  The Norwegians have been </p><p>quite effective in arranging the talks so that each </p><p>round results in some sort of "breakthrough," e.g., the </p><p>December round\'s announcement that the LTTE will aim for </p><p>federalism.  It is not clear what the Norwegians are </p><p>planning to do this time, but it could involve some </p><p>announcement re a framework for solving the complex </p><p>security zone issue. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) As for Kumaratunga\'s letter, it is unfortunate </p><p>that the Norwegians are coming under increasing </p><p>criticism given their constructive role as facilitators. </p><p>In hitting out at the GoN, the president clearly feels </p><p>she has to pander to elements in her party and elsewhere </p><p>that are at the very least skeptical about the peace </p><p>process if not downright opposed.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
