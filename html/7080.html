Most papers predicted </p><p>that the Powell visit would be a "Kiss and Make Up" meeting </p><p>after weeks of tension between the U.S. and Turkey over </p><p>rejection by the parliament of the deployment of foreign </p><p>troops on Turkish soil.  In a joint press conference </p><p>Wednesday, Powell and Gul said Turkey would support search </p><p>and rescue operations in Northern Iraq and facilitate </p><p>transfer of humanitarian aid to the region.  Gul stressed </p><p>that Turkey is part of the U.S.-led coalition, and that a </p><p>new decree is not needed to meet U.S. requests.  Turkey will </p><p>allow delivery of fuel and water for coalition forces </p><p>through its border.  Secretary Powell has asked the Turks to </p><p>ease measures on its border to facilitate trade among the </p><p>Kurds, papers report.  Ankara rejected this idea, saying </p><p>border trade money could go to terrorist groups.  Powell </p><p>stressed that the U.S. wants to stabilize Northern Iraq, and </p><p>that a Turkish intervention is not necessary.  The U.S. gave </p><p>Ankara further assurances that troublesome scenarios would </p><p>not take place in the region.  He vowed that the U.S. would </p><p>ensure control of Mosul and Kirkuk, adding that regional oil </p><p>revenues would go to all Iraqis, not just to the Kurds. </p><p>Secretary Powell also declared that Turkey would be given a </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>share in the reconstruction of post-war Iraq.  Gul </p><p>reportedly outlined for Powell the negative impact of a war </p><p>on Turkey\'s economy, and the Secretary promised that U.S. </p><p>support for Turkey\'s relations with the IMF and WB would </p><p>continue.  Commentaries regard the $1 billion grant and a </p><p>share in Iraq\'s reconstruction as gains for Turkey.  Small </p><p>anti-war groups of NGOs, unions, and students protested </p><p>against the U.S. during Secretary Powell\'s meetings. </p><p>Meanwhile, the TGS denied reports about 25 American trucks </p><p>carrying arms and ammunition via Turkey\'s Habur gate to the </p><p>Northern Iraqi town of Erbil, saying that the trucks took </p><p>Hummer jeeps -- but no weapons -- to the region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  War in Iraq / Powell visit </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Iraqi Ministers" </p><p>Fatih Altayli notes the Iraqi propaganda war in mass appeal </p><p>Hurriyet (4/3): "Iraqi ministers are becoming more popular </p><p>every day with the help of their constant television </p><p>appearances.  Always wearing their military uniforms, they </p><p>are telling the world about Iraq\'s victory, and they have </p><p>won the sympathy of the anti-war group.  Yet who are they </p><p>actually?  A bunch of lunatics who normally should be tried </p><p>at the International Tribunal of Human Rights had the US had </p><p>not carried out an operation in Iraq.  A bunch of killers </p><p>responsible for gassing thousands of Kurds.  A bunch of </p><p>invaders responsible for occupying Kuwait. . Standing </p><p>against the war is certainly the right thing.  However, it </p><p>is appalling to see that those anti-war groups are looking </p><p>for a victory on the criminals\' side." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Repairing relations with the US" </p><p>Murat Yetkin analyzed Secretary Powell\'s visit in liberal- </p><p>intellectual Radikal (4/3): "It seems that Washington has </p><p>realized that punishing Turkey -something the hawks have </p><p>been insisting on --because of the decline of parliamentary </p><p>motion is not a wise move regarding the future of Turkish- </p><p>American bilateral relations.  Secretary Powell emphasized </p><p>this by calling Turkey the `best model\' for the future of </p><p>Iraq and the only Muslim democracy.  Powell\'s visit </p><p>underscored the intention by both Ankara and Washington to </p><p>move forward together." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Powell and his `kiss-and-make-up\' visit" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in the sensational-mass appeal Posta </p><p>(4/3): "The visit of Secretary of State Colin Powell to </p><p>Ankara provided a basis for settling issues of concern to </p><p>both sides.  Both Turkey and the United States have made </p><p>clear that they understand their responsibility for mistakes </p><p>or belated actions.  There was a happy ending in terms of </p><p>the future of Turkish-American relations.  The Powell visit </p><p>was very timely, and certainly prevented continued </p><p>deterioration in bilateral relations.  . The positive </p><p>atmosphere will overcome the negative developments in the </p><p>past unless the bilateral understanding and agreements are </p><p>violated, or unless something unexpected happens during the </p><p>course of war." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
