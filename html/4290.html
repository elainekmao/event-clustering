<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 003077 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR AFRICA WATCHER: PLEASE PASS TO PDAS BELLAMY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MASS, KPKO, NI, IV </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FORCE STRUCTURE AND DEPLOYMENT PLAN FOR </p><p>ECOWAS MONITORING FORCE IN NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 219555 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 3066 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 3067 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: ECOWAS has determined its force structure </p><p>and adopted an ambitious French deployment plan for its </p><p>monitoring force in Cote d\'Ivoire.  The deployment plan </p><p>envisions the arrival of advance elements in Cote d\'Ivoire </p><p>by Friday, November 15 and calls for the monitoring force </p><p>to be in place by the end of November.  However, as of </p><p>November 12, ECOWAS had not yet selected a force commander </p><p>and the commitment of fewer-than-expected troops from </p><p>Senegal and Ghana casts doubt on whether the planned force </p><p>strength and structure are realistic.  Refs. B and C </p><p>contain more detailed logistical information.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) According to the latest planing at the ECOWAS </p><p>Secretariat the proposed monitoring force for Cote d\'Ivoire </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>will consist of 1264 personnel.  The bulk of the force will </p><p>be six infantry combat teams of 173 personnel, one team </p><p>each from Benin, Ghana, Niger, Senegal, and Togo and the </p><p>sixth a composite Niger/Togo force.  The combat units will </p><p>be supported by a 36-man Senegalese logistics group to be </p><p>based in Abidjan and a 75-man logistics group from Niger </p><p>based in Yamoussoukro.  Command will be provided by the </p><p>multinational staff and a 49-man headquarters company from </p><p>Ghana. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The proposed deployment schedule is as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- November 15: Initial planning group deploys to </p><p>Abidjan to work out a plan to relieve French units on </p><p>the ground and to develop the reception, staging, </p><p>onward movement and integration (RSOI) plan.  France </p><p>will supply logistical support to the effort. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Staff officers from contributing countries will </p><p>also travel to Abidjan with detailed lists of their </p><p>deployment requirements.  The original plan called </p><p>for contributing countries to vet the lists with </p><p>ECOWAS in Abuja on November 12.  ODC Abuja and a </p><p>French staff officer were to compare the list with </p><p>the inventory of equipment in the Freetown and Dakar </p><p>depots to determine what could be supplied by the USG </p><p>and the GOF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- November 20: Selected equipment from U.S. and </p><p>French depots will arrive in Abidjan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- November 21: Equipment operators arrive in Abidjan </p><p>for two days of training. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- November 24: Troop contingents begin to arrive, </p><p>gather equipment and deploy to field locations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4:  (C) This swift deployment plan is overly ambitious. </p><p>Moreover, no one has been tasked to develop a plan </p><p>detailing how and when the teams will actually deploy on </p><p>the ground.  Additionally, the rules of engagement for the </p><p>mission have not been developed. The French may assist the </p><p>advance team in Abidjan in developing the deployment plan </p><p>(Ref. C). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5:  (C) ECOWAS has not selected a force commander.  ECOWAS </p><p>Deputy Executive Secretary Diarra told DATT the decision </p><p>was largely a political one and that he would discuss the </p><p>subject with Executive Secretary Chambas when the latter </p><p>returned to Lome.  While Diarra said he hoped to have a </p><p>decision by November 10, that date passed without yielding </p><p>an answer.  Diarra believed Togo would be the likely choice </p><p>for force commander (Ref. B), by default. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6:  (C) COMMENT: The monitoring force is a work in </p><p>progress.  We expect that the force composition and </p><p>structure may change as ECOWAS hits inevitable logistical </p><p>snags in assembling, equipping, and deploying the troops. </p><p>Further requests for USG assistance are likely.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
