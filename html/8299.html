(SBU) On May 16, the Commission for the Investigation of </p><p>the Abuse of Authority (CIAA) issued summons to prominent </p><p>current and former politicians and government employees, </p><p>including former Prime Minister and General Secretary of the </p><p>Nepali Congress Party Girija Prasad Koirala.  On May 19, </p><p>Koirala filed a petition in the Supreme Court requesting a </p><p>stay order, which was denied.  The court did issue a notice </p><p>requiring the CIAA to respond in writing to Koirala\'s </p><p>petition.  Koirala has found little support for his legal </p><p>actions thus far.  Regardless of whether Koirala wins the </p><p>Supreme Court case, his defiance of the CIAA now pits him </p><p>squarely against the public\'s interest in fighting </p><p>corruption.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>New Sweep of Corruption Investigations </p><p>======================================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) On May 16, the Commission for the Investigation of </p><p>the Abuse of Authority (CIAA) issued summonses to over forty </p><p>prominent current and former politicians, ministers, police </p><p>officers, and civil servants, including former Prime Minister </p><p>and General Secretary of the Nepali Congress Party Girija </p><p>Prasad Koirala.  The summonses requested the recipients to </p><p>present themselves at the CIAA\'s office on May 19.  The </p><p>CIAA\'s action was based upon the findings of the Judicial </p><p>Inquiry Commission on Property (JICP), which required 30,000 </p><p>public servants and former officials to provide details on </p><p>their assets (reftel).  The JICP provided the report to the </p><p>King and Cabinet on March 4.  The report was passed to the </p><p>CIAA on May 1, after a Cabinet decision.  On May 8, the Home </p><p>Ministry made public the names of 1,900 politicians, civil </p><p>servants, and police officers who had failed to submit </p><p>property forms.  However, neither the Home Ministry nor the </p><p>CIAA has released the full details of the report, citing the </p><p>need for security during investigations. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Members of the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist </p><p>Leninist (UML), the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), and </p><p>both factions of the Nepali Congress received summonses. </p><p>However, the Nepali Congress, including Koirala\'s daughter, </p><p>received the majority of the actions issued.  Other prominent </p><p>individuals summoned include: </p><p>-- Lok Man Singh Karki, Secretary of the Ministry of </p><p>Population and Environment; </p><p>-- Tirtha Man Shakya, former Chief Secretary; </p><p>-- Chakra Bandu Aryal, former Secretary of Defense; </p><p>-- Padam Prasad Pokharel, former Secretary of Home; </p><p>-- Achut Krishna Kharel, former Inspector General of Police; </p><p>-- Moti Lal Bohara, former Inspector General of Police; </p><p>-- Arjun Narsingh KC, Nepali Congress Central Working </p><p>Committee Member and Party Spokesman; </p><p>-- Sujata Koirala, daughter of G.P. Koirala; </p><p>-- Khum Bahadur Khadka, former Minister of Home; </p><p>-- Bijaya Kumar Gachchhadar, former Minister of Culture, </p><p>Tourism, and Civil Aviation; </p><p>-- Bal Bahadur KC, former Minister of Culture, Tourism, and </p><p>Civil Aviation; </p><p>-- Govinda Raj Joshi, former Minister of Home; </p><p>-- Dr. Prakash Chadra Lohani (RPP), former Minister of </p><p>Finance and of Foreign Affairs; </p><p>-- Dr. Ram Saran Mahat, former Minister of Finance and of </p><p>Foreign Affairs; </p><p>-- Mahesh Acharya, former Minister of Finance; </p><p>-- Bam Dev Gautam, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister </p><p>of Home; </p><p>-- Bhim Rawal (UML), former Minister of Culture, Tourism, and </p><p>Civil Aviation; </p><p>-- Mohan Bahadur Basnet, former Minister of Health; </p><p>-- Mohan Bahadur Karki, Chief of the National Surveillance </p><p>Center; and </p><p>-- Rabindra Nath Sharma, former Minister of Finance. </p><p> </p><p>Koirala Charges Political Motivation </p><p>===================================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Koirala shot back at the CIAA on May 17, charging </p><p>that the CIAA\'s summons was "simply a game to assassinate my </p><p>character."  He also demanded that all of the details of JICP </p><p>report be made public and that the royal family declare all </p><p>of its property wealth back fifty years.  On May 19, Koirala </p><p>filed a petition in the Supreme Court requesting a stay order </p><p>on two alleged grounds.  First, the basis of the CIAA\'s </p><p>summons, the JICP report, was illegally obtained.  Second, </p><p>the CIAA has not followed proper procedure in summoning </p><p>Koirala.  On May 21, the Supreme Court turned down Koirala\'s </p><p>request for a stay order but instead ordered the CIAA to </p><p>respond in writing to Koirala\'s petition within fifteen days. </p><p> Other members of the Nepali Congress Party did not join </p><p>Koirala\'s legal fight and appeared before the CIAA at their </p><p>appointed time. </p><p> </p><p>Others Supportive of CIAA </p><p>========================== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) In pointed contrast to Koirala\'s public fight against </p><p>the CIAA, Madhav Kumar Nepal, General Secretary of the UML, </p><p>stated that "the corrupt should be punished and jailed." </p><p>(Note:  Nepal was not/not among those summoned by the CIAA. </p><p>End note.)  He cautioned, however, that the CIAA </p><p>investigations must be justified and not politically </p><p>motivated.  Executive Director Prakash Sharma of the </p><p>non-governmental organization Pro-Public lauded the </p><p>initiative of the CIAA, arguing that the CIAA is within the </p><p>authority given it by Parliament.  Both Sharma and Ashish </p><p>Thapa, Executive Director of Transparency </p><p>International-Nepal, agreed with the CIAA\'s decision that the </p><p>details of the JIPC report should not be made public in the </p><p>interests of protecting the investigation. </p><p> </p><p>Next Steps </p><p>=========== </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Those summoned probably will continue to trickle into </p><p>the CIAA\'s office over the coming weeks.  During their </p><p>sessions to date, the CIAA has requested clarification of </p><p>property details and the submission of updated financial </p><p>disclosure forms.  According to CIAA statements, the revised </p><p>documentation will be the basis for possible future legal </p><p>action.  The CIAA\'s summons to Koirala still stands and, </p><p>according to CIAA statements in the press, Koirala\'s </p><p>continued refusal to appear before the anti-corruption </p><p>watchdog flouts the authority of that body.  Under law, the </p><p>CIAA has the authority to arrest Koirala.  An unnamed CIAA </p><p>official stated, however, that "we want to maintain civility </p><p>and expect Koirala to come before or after the court verdict." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The two-month hiatus between the delivery of the </p><p>JICP report to the Cabinet and the issuance of summonses </p><p>raises questions about the timing of this far-reaching </p><p>inquiry.  That said, well before the dismissal of the last </p><p>government on October 4, public surveys cited corruption as </p><p>one of Nepali voters\' most pressing concerns.  There is </p><p>widespread public support for CIAA\'s campaign as well as a </p><p>widespread perception that well-entrenched politicians like </p><p>Koirala are appropriate targets of investigation.  Regardless </p><p>of whether Koirala wins the Supreme Court case, his defiance </p><p>of the CIAA now puts him squarely against the public interest </p><p>in fighting corruption and undoubtedly contributes to the </p><p>long-term erosion of support for himself and his party. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
