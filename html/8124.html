<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002884 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR IRAQ TASKFORCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, EAID, AMGT, JO, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: VISA CARD OFFICIAL SEEKS CONTACTS IN BAGHDAD </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Visa Jordan, a subsidiary of Visa International, </p><p>has sent a staff member to Baghdad to work with Iraqi </p><p>businesses to enable them to accept Visa credit and debit </p><p>card payments.  Under the system, a limited number of Iraqi </p><p>businesses would be able to accept such payments, </p><p>authorization would be obtained by a satellite telephone link </p><p>to Visa Jordan, and paperwork would be couriered daily </p><p>between Amman and Baghdad by road.  Visa Jordan is working </p><p>closely with Visa International and Visa headquarters in San </p><p>Francisco to iron out the logistical and legal details. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Visa thought that U.S. government personnel in </p><p>Baghdad, particularly those using Government credit cards </p><p>might have a particular interest in seeing such a system up </p><p>and running.  Mr. Tareq Nasser, the Visa Jordan official is </p><p>staying at the Sumerland Hotel and can be reached on Thuraya </p><p>number 882-166-322-0223.  He would be happy to meet and </p><p>discuss this subject with U.S. representatives. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
