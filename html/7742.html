<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002813 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/SE AND NEA/NGA </p><p>CENTCOM FOR J3, J5 AND POLAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ETTC, IZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  Turkish Trade with Iraq </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  State 104141 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This cable contains an action request.  See para </p><p>11. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary:  Turkish foreign trade officials </p><p>emphasized Turkey\'s desire to gain a share of the </p><p>commercial opportunities arising from Iraq reconstruction, </p><p>and implied that special consideration should be given to </p><p>Turkish companies.  They raised concerns about </p><p>implementation of UN Oil for Food (OFF) Program contracts </p><p>awarded to Turkish companies.  The Foreign Trade </p><p>Undersecretariat provided limited trade information, but </p><p>no realistic estimates of the extent of smuggling outside </p><p>the OFF.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Emboffs met with a group of Foreign Trade </p><p>Undersecretariat officials on April 28 to discuss Turkish </p><p>trade relations with Iraq (reftel) and share information </p><p>on Iraq reconstruction.  Serhat Gok, Deputy General </p><p>Director for Exports, chaired the meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) OFF Contracts:  Gok stated that Turkey\'s prime </p><p>concern now was the fate of the Oil for Food Program (OFF) </p><p>and whether previously approved contracts would go </p><p>forward.  As of the end of Phase 13, Turkey had 182 OFF </p><p>contracts worth USD 350 million, of which 82 (worth USD </p><p>199 million) were approved.  The others were still </p><p>pending.  Econoff responded that OFF had been temporarily </p><p>extended, but that the UN was now giving priority to </p><p>processing and shipping relief items to Iraq under OFF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Reconstruction:  Gok said that trade with Iraq </p><p>was important for the economy of southeastern Turkey, and </p><p>particularly of Turkey\'s trucking sector.  He said that </p><p>about 40 percent of Turkey\'s 25,000 TIR truck fleet was </p><p>currently unemployed and hoped that a revival in trade </p><p>would help put drivers back to work.  Gok told us that </p><p>Turkey hoped to both a prime supplier to U.S. troops and </p><p>to the reconstruction effort (especially export of </p><p>construction services, food, medicines).Hinting at a </p><p>linkage between the U.S. priority treatment of Turkish </p><p>companies under the Boeing offset program, he implied that </p><p>Turkish companies should be given special consideration in </p><p>reconstruction contracts.  Emboffs provided Foreign Trade </p><p>with the Embassy Commercial Service\' factsheet on Iraq </p><p>reconstruction, and responded that Turkish companies were </p><p>welcome to compete on an equal basis for those commercial </p><p>opportunities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Trade Facilitation:  Foreign Trade noted that the </p><p>GOT planned to encourage trade by establishing border </p><p>trade centers in southeastern Turkey, and by opening a </p><p>second border crossing south of Habur.  Gok pointed out </p><p>that the second border crossing would allow Turkish </p><p>truckers to avoid passing through the Kurdistan Democratic </p><p>Party (KDP) territory.  He implied that this was desirable </p><p>not only for political reasons, but also to avoid payment </p><p>of bribes to KDP officials.  A new border crossing would </p><p>also facilitate Turkish trade with Persian Gulf states, </p><p>currently discouraged by high transit fees levied by </p><p>Syria.  Comment:  The entire length of Turkey\'s border </p><p>with Iraq is currently controlled by the KDP on the Iraqi </p><p>side.  Hopefully it will soon be controlled by an Iraqi </p><p>national border authority.  Driving trade away from an </p><p>area of KDP influence is short-sighted and undesirable, </p><p>and, in the short-term, impossible.  Furthermore, the </p><p>Turkish border extends only 20 kilometers south of the </p><p>current Habur crossing.  Establishing a new crossing in </p><p>the same area would appear to have more political than </p><p>economic justification.  Ultimately,  the new Iraqi </p><p>government would have to agree to this new border </p><p>crossing; this could not be a unilateral GOT decision. </p><p>End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) FTA/MOU:  Gok confirmed that the GOT had not </p><p>signed a free trade agreement with the GOI, but </p><p>acknowledged that Turkey and Iraq had a trade MOU.  Gok </p><p>declined to answer Emboffs\' questions about the MOU and </p><p>its relationship with OFF, referring us to MFA. </p><p>8. (U) Trade Data:  Gok provided the following statistics </p><p>on Turkish exports to Iraq based on figures released by </p><p>the Turkish exporters unions (year, exports in USD </p><p>millions): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1999 - 246 </p><p>2000 - 375 </p><p>2001 - 706 </p><p>2002 - 465 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Note:  In January, other Foreign Trade sources estimated </p><p>2002 trade at USD 649.7 million, of which about 500 </p><p>million was "official" trade.  The corresponding figures </p><p>for 2001 were USD 839.8 and 709.6 million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Asked to estimate the scope of illegal trade taking </p><p>place outside OFF, Gok said the so-called suitcase trade </p><p>with all neighboring states to Turkey\'s south and east </p><p>amounted to between USD 3.3 and 7 million between 1998 and </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment and Action Request </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Foreign Trade\'s reticence to discuss Turkey\'s </p><p>MOU and provide realistic estimates of the scope of past </p><p>Iraq trade suggests that the scope of this illegal trade </p><p>was large in relation to Turkey\'s legal trade with Iraq. </p><p>Embassy is not able to estimate the scope of this </p><p>smuggling, but we will continue to discuss these and other </p><p>issues raised in reftel with other GOT officials and with </p><p>trade associations.  Another meeting on Turkish views on </p><p>Iraq economic links and reconstruction will be reported </p><p>septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Embassy would also appreciate an update on </p><p>Turkey\'s pending OFF contracts.  Pearson </p><p></p></div>
