<p>UNCLAS ROME 002636 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IT, PINS, PREL, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: FM FRATTINI ON UNSC REFORM </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (U) SUMMARY:  IN A MAY 3 ARTICLE IN THE CENTRIST DAILY </p><p>CORRIERE DELLA SERA, ITALIAN FM FRATTINI LAID OUT IN DETAIL </p><p>    ITALY\'S VIEW ON SECURITY COUNCIL REFORM.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) FRATTINI ARGUED THAT ITALY WANTS UNSC REFORM, NOT </p><p>REORGANIZATION. ITALY REALISTICALLY SUPPORTS, FOR NOW, </p><p>LEAVING CURRENT PERMANENT MEMBERS AND THEIR VETO POWER </p><p>UNTOUCHED, ACCEPTING THAT THE CURRENT PERMANENT MEMBERS ARE </p><p>UNLIKELY TO GIVE UP THEIR RIGHTS.  HOWEVER, THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL DOES NOT REFLECT DECOLONIALIZATION AND OTHER GLOBAL </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES.  AN UPDATED MEMBERSHIP WOULD </p><p>GIVE THE SECURITY COUNCIL ADDED RELEVANCE AND HELP KEEP ITS </p><p>"CENTRAL ROLE" WITHIN THE SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, FRATTINI LAID OUT A </p><p>PLAN THE GOI HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR MANY YEARS.  RATHER THAN </p><p>ADDING A LIMITED NUMBER OF ROTATING, GEOGRAPHICALLY </p><p>REPRESENTATIONAL MEMBERS, ITALY PROPOSES TO ADD A "WIDE </p><p>RANGE" OF FREQUENTLY ROTATING MEMBERS CHOSEN ON THE BASIS OF </p><p>THEIR ECONOMIC WEIGHT AND THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE UN; THIS </p><p>COMMITMENT BEING MEASURED IN TERMS OF PEACEKEEPING AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.  PREVIOUSLY THE GOI SUPPORTED THE </p><p>ADDITION OF TEN NEW NON-PERMANENT SEATS, DIVIDED </p><p>GEOGRAPHICALLY, AMONG WHICH THIRTY COUNTRIES, CHOSEN BY THE </p><p>GENERAL ASSEMBLY BASED ON "OBJECTIVE CRITERIA," WOULD ROTATE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) ACCEPTING THAT THE CURRENT P-5 WILL NOT RELINQUISH </p><p>THEIR SPECIAL RIGHTS, ITALY NONETHELESS BELIEVES THE "THREAT </p><p>OR USE OF VETO" AGAINST A PREVAILING POSITION WITHIN THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL WOULD BECOME MORE DIFFICULT WERE THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL TO BECOME MORE DEMOCRATIC AND MORE </p><p>REPRESENTATIONAL.  ITALY, FRATTINI SAID, "LOOKS FAR" AND </p><p>ENVISIONS ACHIEVING THIS BY IMPLEMENTING EU COORDINATION IN </p><p>    INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT IS MENTIONED IN THE EU </p><p>TREATIES.  ACCORDING TO FRATTINI, THE TWO EU COUNTRIES </p><p>CURRENTLY IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL, THE U.K. AND FRANCE, </p><p>SHOULD COORDINATE WITH THEIR EU PARTNERS AND REFLECT THEIR </p><p>PARTNERS\' INTERESTS WITHIN THE SECURITY COUNCIL.   HE SAID </p><p>ITALY WOULD WORK WITH THIS OBJECTIVE IN MIND DURING ITS </p><p>UPCOMING EU PRESIDENCY AND POSSIBLY IN 2007-2008, WHEN IT </p><p>HOPES TO BE REELECTED TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL AS A ROTATIONAL </p><p>MEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) FRATTINI NOTED THAT THE EU CONVENTION IS ALSO WORKING </p><p>TOWARD THIS END AND WROTE, WITHOUT OFFERING TIME LIMITS, THAT </p><p>A SECOND STEP FORWARD WOULD BE TO EVENTUALLY ADD AN EU SEAT </p><p>WITHIN THE SECURITY COUNCIL: "IN PARTICULAR IF WE CONSIDER </p><p>THAT, IN A REFORMED COUNCIL, THE VOICE OF EUROPE WOULD </p><p>EXPRESS THE INTERESTS AND OBJECTIVES OF A PROSPEROUS AND </p><p>DEMOCRATIC REGION THAT EXTENDS FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE </p><p>BOUNDARIES WITH RUSSIA AND INCLUDES TURKEY."  LOOKING FURTHER </p><p>AHEAD, HE SAID ITALY COULD EVENTUALLY ENVISION A SINGLE EU </p><p>REPRESENTATION WITHIN THE SECURITY COUNCIL -- I.E. WHERE THE </p><p>UK AND FRANCE WOULD GIVE UP THEIR INDIVIDUAL SEATS AND BE </p><p>INCLUDED IN THE EU SEAT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  COMMENT:  SINCE THE IDEA OF SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>EXPANSION WAS FIRST RAISED MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO, ITALY\'S </p><p>MAIN GOAL HAS BEEN TO KEEP GERMANY FROM BECOMING A PERMANENT </p><p>MEMBER, THEREBY PERMANENTLY RELEGATING ITALY TO A "SECOND </p><p>CLASS" EUROPEAN COUNTRY.  SINCE SECURITY COUNCIL REFORM IS </p><p>NOT A HOT TOPIC AT THE MOMENT, IT IS UNCLEAR WHY FRATTINI </p><p>CHOSE THIS TIME TO RE-STATE LONG-STANDING GOI THOUGHTS ON THE </p><p>SUBJECT.  END COMMENT. </p><p>    SKODON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME02636 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
