<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000933 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, CASC, PHUM, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Maoists Attack Remote University </p><p> </p><p>REFERENCE: Kathmandu 925 </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Storm Sanskrit School </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Approximately 300 Maoist insurgents attacked a </p><p>university in the remote southwestern district of Dang </p><p>late on May 11, according to the Chief District Officer </p><p>(CDO) for the area.  The insurgents set fire to offices at </p><p>Mahendra Sanskrit University, approximately 300 kilometers </p><p>west of Kathmandu, destroying furniture, office equipment </p><p>and books.  No casualties have been reported.  Press </p><p>reports claim most of the attackers were women.  Prior to </p><p>the action, Maoists felled trees across the road in order </p><p>to prevent security forces from reaching the scene. </p><p> </p><p>Phone Line Down </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Because another Maoist attack had knocked out </p><p>telephone service to the area earlier in the week, </p><p>authorities in the district headquarters only learned of </p><p>the incident May 12, and additional information was not </p><p>available. </p><p> </p><p>Out with the Olds </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Sanskrit is the hieratic language of the Hindu </p><p>religion, which until recently could only be taught to the </p><p>Brahmin priestly caste.  Maoists have condemned </p><p>traditional Sanskrit education as feudal and reactionary. </p><p>In Nepal, Mahendra Sanskrit University is the only </p><p>institution offering tertiary-level Sanskrit education. </p><p>The school was established in 1986 and is headquartered in </p><p>Dang, with twelve affiliated campuses throughout the </p><p>country.  On May 29, 2001, a socket bomb went off in the </p><p>vice-chancellor\'s office at the main campus.  No injuries </p><p>resulted.  In the past the Maoists have carried out </p><p>attacks on secondary schools - and even individual </p><p>teachers - for providing instruction in Sanskrit. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Continue to Pressure Schools </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Maoist attacks on educational institutions have </p><p>increased dramatically in recent months.  On May 12 </p><p>Maoists torched two school buses at a private school in </p><p>Chitwan district, south-central Nepal.  The students were </p><p>in their classrooms at the time.  Last September Maoists </p><p>called an "education strike" that closed down schools </p><p>throughout the country.  General strikes regularly shut </p><p>down classes for days at a stretch. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) As related Reftel, the Maoist insurgency has had </p><p>a detrimental effect on many aspects of the lives of </p><p>children throughout Nepal.  Economic indicators have begun </p><p>to fall as a result of the insurgency, and human </p><p>development indicators cannot be far behind.  Without </p><p>continued gains in education, Nepal will face grim </p><p>prospects for long-term economic development.  The Maoists </p><p>seem unconcerned, however, and Maoists leaders have sent </p><p>their children abroad, to India or the U.K., to be </p><p>educated. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
