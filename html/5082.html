In a threatening tone, </p><p>Ramadan warned Turkey to refrain from giving support to the </p><p>U.S., papers report.  Ramadan also said that reports about </p><p>Turkey\'s possible claims on Mosul and Kirkuk served the </p><p>intentions of the `evil American Administration and </p><p>Zionists.\' He then ended the press conference without giving </p><p>Tuzmen a chance to speak.  Mainstream papers characterize </p><p>the press conference as `scandalous.\'  Tuzmen was also </p><p>received by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who urged Turkey to </p><p>mediate on behalf of Iraq to prevent war.  Prime Minister </p><p>Gul wrapped up his Middle East tour after meetings with </p><p>Iranian leaders in Tehran on Sunday.  Gul said that UNSC </p><p>resolutions should be applied, and added that Iraq had </p><p>primary responsibility for taking steps to avert war. </p><p>Syrian Foreign Minister Al-Shara is expected in Ankara on </p><p>Monday to discuss the Iraq crisis, dailies report. </p><p>Meanwhile, papers highlight meetings of former U.S. </p><p>Ambassador Mark Parris with government and business leaders. </p><p>Parris warned that if Ankara further delays a decision on </p><p>Iraq, the U.S. would shift its plans and consider Kuwait and </p><p>Jordan as alternative sites from which to launch attacks </p><p>against Iraq.  If support from Turkey does not materialize, </p><p>the U.S. will ignore Turkish views regarding a post-Saddam </p><p>transition.  Parris added that U.S.-Turkish ties would </p><p>suffer a setback that would be felt for years, since </p><p>President Bush is expected to be re-elected and remain in </p><p>office until 2008.  Saturday\'s papers report that U.S. </p><p>Ambassador Robert Pearson met with Prime Minister Gul on </p><p>Friday.  `The U.S. has made certain demands,\' Gul said, </p><p>adding that the parliament was to decide how to respond. </p><p>Weekend papers say that Turkey\'s Ambassador to Washington </p><p>was told that the U.S. expects a swift response, and was </p><p>given the message that U.S. aid to Turkey might be increased </p><p>to $14 billion.  Meanwhile, 150 U.S. experts are expected to </p><p>begin site surveys in Van, Mus, Diyarbakir, and Malatya </p><p>airports, and in Mersin port on Monday.  The TGS issued a </p><p>statement saying that U.S. specialists would be accompanied </p><p>by Turkish army officials, and that the surveys are expected </p><p>to take ten days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: In a statement following talks with UN Cyprus envoy </p><p>Alvaro de Soto on Friday, MFA said that discussion of the UN- </p><p>sponsored Cyprus plan would begin soon.  The Greek and </p><p>Italian foreign ministers, EU expansion commissioner </p><p>Verheugen, and EU foreign policy chief Solana are expected </p><p>in Turkey before late January.  Reports say that Parliament </p><p>Speaker Bulent Arinc will lead a parliamentary delegation of </p><p>20 to the Turkish Cypriot sector January 13-15 for talks </p><p>with political, military, and NGO leaders.  Meanwhile, DSP </p><p>leader and former Prime Minister Ecevit said at a meeting in </p><p>Istanbul that if the UN plan is accepted, Turkey will face </p><p>difficulty with its access to the Aegean.  He claimed that </p><p>the Greek Cypriot administration is illegitimate and </p><p>violates international agreements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economy: An IMF delegation under the chairmanship of the </p><p>Fund\'s First Deputy Director Anne Krueger is due in Turkey </p><p>this week to discuss banking sector problems and excessive </p><p>employment in the public sector.  Monday\'s dailies expect </p><p>the business community to issue a warning to the government </p><p>for its controversial moves in economic policy.  The </p><p>businessmen will stress that the future of the government </p><p>depends on the strict implementation of the IMF-sponsored </p><p>economic stabilization program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq/General Myers visit </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Myers Visit" </p><p>Fikret Bila highlights the upcoming visit of General Myers </p><p>to Ankara (1/13): "Washington hopes to get a clear and final </p><p>response to its requests during the Myers visit.  This visit </p><p>will help Washington determine whether or not to plan for a </p><p>second front in the north.   Prior to the Myers visit, the </p><p>(Turkish) government is doing everything to play for time. </p><p>. Washington\'s hope is to receive a clear `yes\' or `no\' from </p><p>Ankara.  However, if the AKP government continues to be </p><p>evasive, the Turkish General Staff will only tell General </p><p>Myers to wait for a political decision.  . It seems even </p><p>without a political decision, the Turkish military has </p><p>intensified its preparations as if expecting a war.  Turkish </p><p>and American military officials are working on joint </p><p>operational plans.  . The government is against a war, but </p><p>also concerned about the possible consequences of a refusal </p><p>to cooperate with the US.   In fact, Turkey does not have </p><p>much time to make the decision, which is being eagerly </p><p>awaited by both Washington and the Turkish military." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The US regrets its support for the AKP" </p><p>Washington reporter of mass appeal Sabah, Asli Aydintasbas </p><p>wrote (1/13): "Washington has started questioning the </p><p>support it has given to Turkey\'s AKP, and to AKP leader </p><p>Tayyip Erdogan.  The Turkish government\'s delayed answers to </p><p>requests for cooperation on Iraq are becoming major </p><p>disappointment in the Washington administration.  After </p><p>waiting for some time for a clear stance from Ankara, </p><p>Washington has started sending `alarm signals\' as well as </p><p>threats for sanctions in the event of Turkey\'s refusal to </p><p>cooperate. A senior US official said last week that the US </p><p>was determined to attack Iraq from the north, even if Turkey </p><p>refused to cooperate. `But in this case an economic aid </p><p>package for Turkey will drop from the agenda, and Turkish- </p><p>American ties will deteriorate,\' the official warned." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Alarm Bells" </p><p>Washington reporter of mass appeal Milliyet, Yasemin Congar </p><p>warns (1/13): "Washington is very disturbed about Ankara\'s </p><p>indecision. The US administration, by looking at the current </p><p>picture in Ankara, concludes that the Iraq issue has been </p><p>clearly understood by the Turkish military and the Foreign </p><p>Ministry, yet the government itself is still not `getting </p><p>it.\'  . Those who look from Washington to Ankara see a </p><p>double-headed government. They sense differences between AKP </p><p>leader Erdogan and Prime Minister Gul.  By evaluating </p><p>Erdogan\'s statements while he was in the US, they thought </p><p>that if he were PM, there could be positive changes on both </p><p>Cyprus and the Iraq issue.  . Those in Washington also </p><p>question whether or not Turkey is a real ally. They are </p><p>astonished by State Minister Tuzmen, who told journalists </p><p>that Turkey\'s goal is to improve trade relations with Iraq, </p><p>and flew to Baghdad with a group of 350 businessmen.  . </p><p>Turkey better listen to the alarm bells in Washington, and </p><p>not rely too much on the notion that it is `indispensable\' </p><p>to the U.S. administration because of its geo-strategic </p><p>location." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
