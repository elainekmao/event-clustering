(U) Classified by Charge D\'Affaires Richard A. </p><p>Albright, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S//NF) The following answers are keyed to </p><p>questions in ref D regarding Gulf countries\' views and </p><p>intentions on Iraqi reconstruction posed by Washington </p><p>analysts: </p><p> </p><p>A. Not applicable, although we would note that the UAE </p><p>Red Crescent Authority has undertaken robust </p><p>humanitarian operations within Iraq, as has the Shaykh </p><p>Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum Charity and </p><p>Humanitarian Foundation (whose patron is the UAE </p><p>Defense Minister and Dubai Crown Prince) in Dubai. </p><p>These two quasi-governmental charities currently are </p><p>serving as the umbrella organizations for the rest of </p><p>the UAE\'s NGO\'s relief efforts in Iraq, and have </p><p>largely coordinated their activities in Iraq with the </p><p>Mission. </p><p> </p><p>B. Recent UAEG policy has helped position local </p><p>companies for long-term opportunities in the </p><p>rebuilding of Iraq.  The UAEG sees its role in the </p><p>informal consultative group in Iraq reconstruction as </p><p>a way to brandish its credentials, and prove it\'s a </p><p>major player.  The UAEG signed an agreement in March </p><p>with the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) </p><p>formalizing WFP\'s regional office in Dubai, which is </p><p>likely to benefit UAE logistics and transportation </p><p>companies.  The UAEG ratified a largely symbolic free </p><p>trade agreement with Iraq in May 2002, and Dubai in </p><p>particular has had close links with the Iraqi merchant </p><p>class post-1990 because of the ferry service between </p><p>Umm Qasr and Dubai.  While the UAEG has not outlined </p><p>any specific quid pro quo, it clearly hopes its </p><p>cooperation and support for Operation Iraqi Freedom </p><p>will return dividends as Iraq reconstruction contracts </p><p>are let. </p><p> </p><p>C. UAE businesses -- although confused by the initial </p><p>award by USAID of eight Iraq reconstruction contracts </p><p>-- are aware that these contracts are the tip of the </p><p>iceberg.  Local businessmen are encouraged by the </p><p>recent subcontract awarded by Stevedoring Services to </p><p>Dubai Ports Authority for the operation of Umm Qasr </p><p>Port.  We expect UAE oilfield, telecom, </p><p>infrastructure, and financial services companies to </p><p>build upon their reputation for providing first-class </p><p>service, and compete for a number of USAID </p><p>subcontracts and long-term Iraq reconstruction </p><p>contracts. </p><p> </p><p>D. UAE efforts to coordinate regional action on Iraq </p><p>have been limited to humanitarian and multilateral </p><p>financial institution activities.  The UAE Red </p><p>Crescent Authority hosted on 4/6 in Abu Dhabi a forum </p><p>of international aid organizations to discuss the </p><p>humanitarian situation in Iraq.  This was the first </p><p>major meeting of the International Federation of Red </p><p>Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International </p><p>Committee of the Red Cross, and the national societies </p><p>of the UAE, Jordan, Turkey, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, </p><p>Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar since the war in Iraq </p><p>began.  The Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund </p><p>likewise hosted a 4/22 meeting of Arab financial </p><p>institutions to discuss multilateral assistance to </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>E. We do not know Iraq\'s official debt to the UAE, but </p><p>the UAE Central Bank Governor told Econchief 5/11 that </p><p>the amount is negligible.  However, a London-based </p><p>think tank recently estimated Iraq\'s official debt to </p><p>the UAE, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain at less than USD $17 </p><p>billion -- an amount that is far from negligible. </p><p>Post has received indications, however, that the UAEG </p><p>would follow the IMF\'s lead on Iraq\'s multilateral </p><p>debt -- i.e. rescheduling, but probably little or no </p><p>forgiveness.  UAE officials have not discussed their </p><p>intentions with us regarding the reconstruction of the </p><p>Iraqi military and security services, but MFA Minstate </p><p>Hamdan told the Ambassador 5/7 that the UAEG favors </p><p>lifting the sanctions on Iraq as soon as possible to </p><p>fund the reconstitution of vital Iraqi governmental </p><p>organizations (ref C). </p><p> </p><p>F. UAE is unconcerned. </p><p>G. As referenced in paragraph C above, certain UAE </p><p>industries are likely to reach out to an Interim Iraqi </p><p>Authority before others.  UAEG officials undertook in </p><p>a 4/29 conference call of the informal group of </p><p>countries on Iraq reconstruction to provide oil </p><p>experts for Iraqi oilfield assessment, and to train </p><p>Iraqi Central Bank officials. </p><p>Two passenger ferry companies that operated out of </p><p>Dubai under UN sanctions are eager to resume service </p><p>to Iraq.  As the UN deliberates the future of Iraq </p><p>sanctions, however, the status of ferry operations </p><p>from Dubai remains unclear.  (Note: One of those </p><p>companies, NAIF Marine Services, made a one-time </p><p>"humanitarian" voyage to the port of Umm Qasr since </p><p>hostilities ceased, and carried more than 300 pilgrims </p><p>and cargo.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>Dubai\'s Civil Aviation Operations Manager told Dubai </p><p>PolEconoff on 4/30 that Dubai-based Emirates Airlines </p><p>is eager to begin service to Baghdad, and will seek to </p><p>renew with an Interim Iraqi Authority a February 1990 </p><p>agreement authorizing the airline to operate six </p><p>flights per week to Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>In the absence of Iraqi banking sector reform and an </p><p>independent Central Bank of Iraq, it is unlikely that </p><p>UAE financial institutions will seek to forge </p><p>relationships with Iraqi banks in the near future. </p><p>Financial service providers in the UAE historically </p><p>have viewed Iraqi banks as not credible; the UAE </p><p>Central Bank closely scrutinizes the activities of </p><p>Rafidain Bank in the UAE and has limited its retail </p><p>banking operations. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) This cable has been coordinated with AmConsul </p><p>Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
