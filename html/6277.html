<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000592 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DRL/IRF, DRL, and EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, SOCI, PGOV, VM, ETMIN, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT:  Religion in Lao Cai and Yen Bai - Different Stories </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  A.  02 Hanoi 2628    B.  Hanoi 0551 </p><p> </p><p>-     C.  Hanoi 566        D.  Hanoi 073 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  Local officials in two mountainous, </p><p>predominantly minority northwestern provinces appear to be </p><p>taking differing approaches towards religion.  Lao Cai </p><p>officials talked a cautious and rigid line while trying to </p><p>explain how they have supported religious practice within </p><p>legal guidelines.  They refused to acknowledge even the </p><p>existence of Protestantism in Lao Cai.  Yen Bai authorities </p><p>highlighted the increase in the province\'s (still small) </p><p>number of Catholics and Buddhists, and expressed a live-and- </p><p>let-live attitude towards ethnic minority Protestants. </p><p>Septel will cover ethnic minority affairs in the two </p><p>provinces.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Poloff and Pol FSN met with the Acting Director Xan </p><p>Quang of the Lao Cai Department Religious Affairs on </p><p>February 19, with a TV cameraman present.  Quang, making </p><p>frequent references to "great national unity," read a </p><p>doctrinaire explanation of the CPV\'s policy on religion and </p><p>its implementation through the GVN\'s Decree 26 of 1999. </p><p>Stressing the "favorable conditions" for religion provided </p><p>by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) and the GVN, he </p><p>outlined the development of religious practice in Lao Cai </p><p>for Catholic and Buddhist believers. </p><p> </p><p>Catholics in Lao Cai </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Lao Cai\'s 10-12,000 Catholics are under Hung Hoa </p><p>Diocese, headquartered in Ha Tay province.  There are two </p><p>parish churches, one in Lao Cai town, the other in Sapa </p><p>town, as well as five Catholic chapels.  Members of the </p><p>Hmong minority worship at two of the chapels, while the </p><p>other congregations are almost entirely ethnic majority </p><p>Kinh.  There are no priests assigned to Lao Cai, but a </p><p>diocesan "vicar" visits five times a year, spending about </p><p>100 days in the province. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Quang, several other officials, and the TV </p><p>cameraman escorted poloffs to Lao Cai town\'s Coc Leo </p><p>Catholic Church.  A Catholic worker ("tu sy," a term used in </p><p>Catholic circles apparently to describe seminary graduates </p><p>who have not yet been ordained) is resident at the church. </p><p>Provincial officials claimed that the Chinese had destroyed </p><p>the original Catholic church in Lao Cai during the 1979 </p><p>border fighting.  The current large concrete cruciform </p><p>structure rising prominently near the Red River was built </p><p>between 1999-2002.  There are three services each Saturday </p><p>and Sunday, with over 1000 people attending on a weekly </p><p>basis.  The Catholic worker conducts some religious </p><p>education classes, but most are taught by specially trained </p><p>laypersons who are "recognized" by provincial authorities. </p><p>Provincial officials expressed confidence that there would </p><p>"soon" be a priest in Lao Cai, probably at Coc Leo Church, </p><p>but claimed the final decision depended on the bishop. </p><p> </p><p>No Protestants in Lao Cai </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Quang did not mention Protestants at all in his </p><p>prepared statement.  In response to questions, he claimed </p><p>that he had not been notified that the GVN-recognized </p><p>Evangelical Church of Vietnam-North (ECVN) had enrolled any </p><p>Lai Cai-based Protestant congregations (ref a).  He further </p><p>claimed that he had heard "nothing" about Protestants in the </p><p>province.  When asked if it was legal to posses a Bible, </p><p>Quang answered that this would be decided according to </p><p>specific case-by-case circumstances, based on the policy of </p><p>the CPV and the GVN.  However, all "officially published </p><p>documents" were permissible, including Bibles published by </p><p>the GVN\'s Religious Publishing House, he clarified. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Poloff expressed concern over numerous reports of </p><p>problems Hmong Protestants in Lao Cai\'s Bao Thang district </p><p>were experiencing in trying peacefully to practice their </p><p>faith (ref b provides details on allegations of attempts at </p><p>forced renunciation in several districts in Lao Cai). </p><p>Poloff emphasized that such reports were publicized overseas </p><p>and would hurt Vietnam\'s international image.   Poloff </p><p>assured Quang and his colleagues that there was no American </p><p>plot to divide Vietnam and that US policy supports the </p><p>territorial integrity of Vietnam.  He urged officials to </p><p>allow Protestants to practice their religion peacefully </p><p>without interference.  Poloff asked Quang to comment on </p><p>these reports, but Quang only replied that he had no "formal </p><p>documentation" about such reports and categorically refused </p><p>to comment further.  He assured Poloff that he knew </p><p>Protestantism was not an "American" religion and added that </p><p>it was actually a "good" religion. </p><p>A Few Buddhists </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Quang said that there were "a few thousand" </p><p>Buddhists and one pagoda in Lao Cai, but no monks.  In </p><p>principle, he explained, there was no problem with assigning </p><p>a monk to the pagoda, but there had been no formal request </p><p>yet.  He said that monks come from Quan Su Pagoda in Hanoi </p><p>once or twice a year to perform ceremonies.  (An official at </p><p>Quan Su Pagoda later confirmed this.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Poloffs visited Cam Lo Pagoda in an agricultural </p><p>village near Cam Duong town about 15 km outside Lao Cai </p><p>town.  About a dozen people, mostly women, were at the </p><p>pagoda praying, while others were preparing decorations.  A </p><p>pagoda attendant confirmed that monks come from Hanoi to </p><p>perform ceremonies during some important holidays such as </p><p>the Buddha\'s birthday.  She indicated that these requests </p><p>were made on an ad hoc basis rather than as part of an </p><p>annual plan submitted to provincial authorities.  Like Coc </p><p>Leo Church, Cam Lo Pagoda was said to have been destroyed </p><p>during the 1979 Chinese invasion.  The pagoda was rebuilt </p><p>around 1990 on the site of the original structure.  Much of </p><p>the pagoda\'s financial support was apparently local, but a </p><p>large portion of the pagoda\'s publicly listed donors showed </p><p>residences elsewhere in Vietnam.  In addition to the pagoda, </p><p>there are Buddhist shrines in at least some of the temples </p><p>for other traditional religions in Lao Cai. </p><p> </p><p>Traditional Temples </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  In response to Embassy\'s overall request to visit </p><p>various religious establishments in Lao Cai, Quang also took </p><p>poloffs to a large traditional complex dedicated to 16th </p><p>century general Tran Hung Dao, located directly across the </p><p>Nanxi river from China.  Except for a huge banyan tree, </p><p>several steles and some furnishings, the temple was entirely </p><p>rebuilt after the 1979 border conflict.  Poloffs had visited </p><p>the temple on their own the evening before; during both </p><p>visits, a variety of people were participating in rituals in </p><p>different parts of the temple.  The temple\'s attendant </p><p>claimed that a recent festival had attracted 160,000 people </p><p>from all over Vietnam.  There was still some evidence of a </p><p>recent large gathering. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  Poloffs also visited two other local temples, </p><p>including one dedicated to the traditional "motherhood </p><p>goddess."  This well-maintained temple in Lao Cai town is </p><p>located on what looks like prime real estate next to the </p><p>bridge over the Nanxi River dividing Vietnam and China. </p><p>Even at 9:00 p.m., dozens of people were visiting the </p><p>temple, including more than a dozen mostly young women </p><p>participating in a ceremony presided over by two robed </p><p>attendants to ask for the "help of ancestors in heaven."  A </p><p>number of people were also visiting the traditional temple </p><p>next to Cam Lo Pagoda at the time poloffs visited. </p><p> </p><p>Religion "Strongly Developing" in Yen Bai </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)   Yen Bai provincial Director of Religious Affairs </p><p>Tran Duc Thang briefed poloffs on February 21 and later </p><p>escorted them to the Catholic church in Yen Bai city.  Thang </p><p>made brief reference to CPV resolutions and Decree 26, </p><p>emphasizing that the province did not discriminate on the </p><p>basis of religion.  He highlighted that Yen Bai officials </p><p>only carried out their "state management tasks" and did not </p><p>interfere in the internal affairs of religious groups.  He </p><p>explained that a People\'s Committee member and a member of </p><p>the Vietnam Fatherland Front (VFF) in each local </p><p>jurisdiction were responsible for religious affairs.  The </p><p>Yen Bai VFF had launched an "excellent movement" to mobilize </p><p>Catholics; a Catholic farmers\' group was particularly </p><p>successful, Thang claimed. </p><p> </p><p>Catholics in Yen Bai </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Thang said that only over six percent of the </p><p>province\'s population was either Catholic or Buddhist. </p><p>Since the province divided from Lao Cai in 1992, the number </p><p>of Catholics had increased from 34,000 to 44,000.  About </p><p>3,000 of the Catholics were Hmong.  The 36 Catholic </p><p>facilities in 1992 had grown to 69, and the 37 Catholic </p><p>congregations to 85.  There are five priests, two ordained </p><p>in 2000, according to Director Thang.  Three of the priests </p><p>were not yet legally resident in the province.  Two Yen Bai </p><p>students are now attending the Catholic seminary in Hanoi, </p><p>he added.  Thang claimed that there were over 20 nuns in Yen </p><p>Bai, an increase from two in 1992.  (Note:  This claim is in </p><p>marked contrast to the difficulties nuns face in receiving </p><p>GVN recognition elsewhere in Vietnam -- see refs c and d. </p><p>End note.)  Each Catholic congregation received a priest </p><p>three or four times a year, he asserted.  The province also </p><p>facilitated special requests by Yen Bai\'s priests and visits </p><p>by priests from other provinces, he claimed.  He cited the </p><p>participation of 30 to 40 priests in two ceremonies in </p><p>recent years at the Catholic church in Yen Bai town as well </p><p>as the activities of the three non-resident priests. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  The priest at Yen Bai\'s Catholic church said that </p><p>he was responsible for three of Yen Bai\'s districts as well </p><p>as Yen Bai town and that another priest was responsible for </p><p>the other four.  He was assisted by a seminarian, scheduled </p><p>to graduate in 2004.  He admitted some difficulty </p><p>communicating with the Hmong Catholics in his charge when he </p><p>began working in Yen Bai in 1992 and noted that there were </p><p>still no church documents available in the Hmong language. </p><p>A priest at the Hung Hoa diocesan office later confirmed </p><p>that, while there are two priests resident in Yen Bai, only </p><p>one (not three) non-resident priest is currently working in </p><p>the province.  He said that one of the province\'s two </p><p>seminarians is scheduled to graduate in June and that the </p><p>diocese expects to assign him to Yen Bai, pending provincial </p><p>government approval. </p><p> </p><p>Buddhists in Yen Bai </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  Thang claimed that the 1,000 Buddhists in Yen Bai </p><p>in 1992 had now increased to 5,000.  He said that "due to </p><p>wars and disinterest" there were "almost no" Buddhist </p><p>facilities in 1992, but that there were now nine.  He added </p><p>that the provincial administration had approved the </p><p>assignment of monks and said that they would come "soon." </p><p> </p><p>Protestants </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U)  In response to questions, Thang said that the </p><p>authorities were aware of several thousand Hmong Protestants </p><p>in Yen Bai.  He claimed that the Protestants did not know a </p><p>great deal about their religion, but that they caused no </p><p>problems and the authorities left them alone.  Most of them </p><p>were not actually from Yen Bai, but had migrated from other </p><p>provinces such as Lao Cai, according to Thang. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  Poloff noted frequent reports in the international </p><p>media about abuses of religious freedom in Vietnam, </p><p>particularly of Protestants, which cause problems for </p><p>Vietnam\'s image abroad.  Reports do not seem to come from </p><p>Yen Bai, however; poloff remarked that the authorities\' </p><p>stance of leaving the Hmong Protestants alone seems </p><p>positive.  He noted to Thang that such a hands off attitude </p><p>would be a good example for other provinces to follow. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U)  Lao Cai and Yen Bai have grown apart in their </p><p>attitude towards regulating religion since their split in </p><p>1992.  While post has received many reports of religious </p><p>freedom problems in Lao Cai, Embassy sources could not come </p><p>up with any specific problems for Protestants in Yen Bai. </p><p>Although Yen Bai\'s depiction of religion in the province </p><p>appears to have been somewhat sugarcoated, the differences </p><p>between the two provinces are nonetheless striking.  These </p><p>differences demonstrate the important influence of local </p><p>officials on religious practice in Vietnam.  Concerns about </p><p>"national unity" -- real or imagined -- seem to be a major </p><p>excuse in cracking down on religious freedom in Vietnam; </p><p>such worries are likely felt more keenly in border </p><p>provinces. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
