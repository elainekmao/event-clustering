(C)  IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF TRIAL BEFORE THE MILITARY </p><p>TRIBUNAL, THE PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN ORGANIZATION OF 94 EGYPTIANS </p><p>AND FOREIGNERS, WHICH HAS BECOME KNOWN AS "AL-WA\'AD" (THE </p><p>PROMISE), IS ALLEGED TO BE A SOPHISTICATED NETWORK OF </p><p>TERRORIST CELLS.  INDICTMENTS WERE ISSUED AGAINST 94 </p><p>DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING 7 FUGITIVES, ACCUSED OF FORMING A </p><p>CLANDESTINE ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION WITH THE PURPOSE OF IMPEDING </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION AND EGYPTIAN LAW, INFRINGING ON PERSONAL </p><p>FREEDOM AND PUBLIC RIGHTS AND DAMAGING NATIONAL UNITY AND </p><p>SOCIAL PEACE.  A NUMBER OF MEMBERS WERE ALLEGEDLY PLANNING TO </p><p>COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS, INCLUDING ASSASSINATION OF PUBLIC AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT FIGURES.  THEY COLLECTED FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>CLAIMS, UPWARDS OF $1,000,000 IN THE PAST TWO YEARS.  WHILE </p><p>THE GROUP CLAIMS IT WAS NOT PLANNING INTERNAL OPERATIONS IN </p><p>EGYPT, IT ADMITTED SUPPORTING PALESTINIAN AND CHECHEN </p><p>FIGHTERS.  AL-WA\'AD IS SAID TO BE HEADED BY TWO RELIGIOUS </p><p>FIGURES AND A COMPUTER ENGINEER.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>PROSECUTION, ITS GOAL WAS TO UNDERMINE THE STATE AND TO </p><p>ASSASSINATE POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR FIGURES, </p><p>INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUBARAK AND THE SHEIKH OF AL-AZHAR.  IN </p><p>REALITY, LITTLE HAS COME TO LIGHT ABOUT THE TRUE ASPIRATIONS </p><p>OF THE GROUP, WHICH ADMITTEDLY COLLECTED LARGE SUMS OF MONEY, </p><p>WHICH IT CLAIMS WAS BEING SENT TO CHECHEN REBELS AND </p><p>PALESTINIANS (HAMMAS).  THE TRIAL CONTINUES AT A RAPID PACE </p><p>AS WE APPROACH THE LONG EID AL-FITR HOLIDAY BUT IS NOT LIKELY </p><p>TO CONCLUDE FOR ANOTHER FEW WEEKS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>REINVIGORATING THE MILITARY COURTS SYSTEM </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2 YEARS, CIVILIAN DEFENDANTS </p><p>WERE REFERRED TO EGYPT\'S MILITARY COURTS SYSTEM FOR TRIAL. </p><p>THE TRIAL OF THE FIRST OF THREE CIVILIAN GROUPS IN THE </p><p>MILITARY TRIBUNAL AT HUCKSTEP, OUTSIDE CAIRO, BEGAN ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 18.  SOME OF THE DEFENDANTS STAND ACCUSED OF </p><p>TERRORIST-RELATED CRIMES.  INDICTMENTS WERE ISSUED AGAINST 94 </p><p>DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING 7 FUGITIVES, ACCUSED OF FORMING A </p><p>CLANDESTINE ILLEGAL ORGANIZATION WITH THE PURPOSE OF IMPEDING </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION AND EGYPTIAN LAW, INFRINGING ON PERSONAL </p><p>FREEDOM AND PUBLIC RIGHTS AND DAMAGING NATIONAL UNITY AND </p><p>SOCIAL PEACE.  A NUMBER OF MEMBERS WERE ALLEGEDLY PLANNING TO </p><p>COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS, INCLUDING ASSASSINATION OF PUBLIC AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT FIGURES, MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS, EGYPTIANS AND </p><p>AMERICANS.  THEY COLLECTED FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS, </p><p>UPWARDS OF $1,000,000 IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN INTIFADA AND CHECHEN REBELS.  WHILE AL-WA\'AD </p><p>CLAIMS IT WAS NOT PLANNING INTERNAL OPERATIONS IN EGYPT, IT </p><p>ADMITTED SUPPORTING PALESTINIAN AND CHECHEN FIGHTERS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>LEADERS AND MEMBERS OF AL-WA\'AD </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) FORMED IN 1996, AL-WA\'AD\'S OPERATIONS WERE </p><p>CLANDESTINE, ACCORDING TO THE PROSECUTION.  THE </p><p>INVESTIGATION, ONGOING SINCE MAY 2001, REVEALED A NETWORK </p><p>HEADED BY TWO POPULAR PRAYER LEADERS, SHEIKH FAWZY AL-SAYEED, </p><p>57, FROM AL-TAWHEED MOSQUE IN DOWNTOWN CAIRO AND NASHAT </p><p>IBRAHIM, 46, THE ORATOR OF THE KABUL MOSQUE IN THE SUBURB OF </p><p>NASR CITY.  (NOTE: NASHAT WAS ARRESTED IN 1981, IN CONNECTION </p><p>WITH THE SADAT ASSASSINATION, SPENT A YEAR IN PRISON, AFTER </p><p>WHICH HE TRAVELED TO SAUDI ARABIA BEFORE RETURNING TO FOUND </p><p>AL- WA\'AD.)  WHILE NASHAT CLAIMED THAT AL-WA\'AD WAS OPPOSED </p><p>TO TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE, THE PROSECUTION ALLEGED THEY WERE </p><p>PLANNING INTERNAL SUBVERSION AND VIOLENCE.  IN ADDITION TO </p><p>THE FORMAL CHARGES, AL-SAYEED HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF ISSUING A </p><p>FATWA (RELIGIOUS OPINION) CLAIMING THE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT IS </p><p>AN INFIDEL WHO DOES NOT IMPLEMENT SHARIA (ISLAMIC LAW) </p><p>RULINGS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AL-WA\'AD MEMBERS INCLUDED EGYPTIANS AND FOREIGNERS, </p><p>AMONG THEM DUAL NATIONALS FROM THE U.S. (MUHAMMAD HISHAM SAYF </p><p>AL-DIN YOUSSEF) , HOLLAND (HISHAM MAHMOUD DIYAB), AUSTRIA </p><p>(MUHAMMAD RABBAH SALIM) AND GERMANY (MUHAMMAD HASAN </p><p>AL-WARDANI).  A PRINCIPAL DEFENDANT AND ALLEGED LEADER OF THE </p><p>AL-WA\'AD ORGANIZATION, MAGDI IDRIS, 33 YEARS OLD, IS A </p><p>COMPUTER ENGINEER WHO OWNS A SPORTS GYM, ALLEGEDLY A SITE FOR </p><p>TRAINING MILITANTS.  HE REPORTEDLY RECRUITED MEMBERS ABROAD </p><p>TO CONDUCT MILITARY AND EXPLOSIVES TRAINING IN EGYPT.  AN </p><p>AL-WA\'AD MEMBER, A DAGESTANI BOMB EXPERT, WAS FOUND IN </p><p>POSSESSION OF NUMEROUS EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.  TWELVE EGYPTIAN </p><p>SUSPECTS WERE CHARGED WITH RECEIVING MILITARY TRAINING </p><p>OUTSIDE EGYPT, WITHOUT GOVERNMENT PERMISSION.  TWO OR THREE </p><p>SEVERAL DEFENDANTS, ACCORDING TO STATE SECURITY PROSECUTION, </p><p>WERE TRAINED IN AFGHANISTAN.  OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDED </p><p>BUSINESSMEN, COMPUTER EXPERTS AND PILOTS.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>CLAIMS THAT THE GROUP ADVOCATED A VIOLENT IDEOLOGY, SIMILAR </p><p>TO EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, INTENDING TO ATTACK PRESIDENT </p><p>MUBARAK, GOVERNMENT AND AMERICAN OFFICIALS, POPULAR SECULAR </p><p>FIGURES AND THE MODERATE SHEIKH OF AL-AZHAR.  NASSERITE </p><p>WEEKLY AL-ARABY REPORTED (11/1/01) THAT ACCORDING TO SHEIKH </p><p>FAWZY AL-SAYEED, THE NAMES OF SIX INITIAL DEFENDANTS, SONS OF </p><p>FORMER AND PRESENT SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, WERE DROPPED </p><p>FROM THE FORMAL INDICTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>OPENING SESSION: THE PLOT REVEALED </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  AT THE OPENING SESSION (11/18), THE COURT HEARD </p><p>REQUESTS FROM DEFENSE ATTORNEYS, WHO FAILED TO FORM A DEFENSE </p><p>PANEL, LED BY ONE LAWYER.  MANY ATTORNEYS FOR THE DEFENSE </p><p>STRESSED THAT THEY WANTED TO PROCEED INDEPENDENTLY TO DEFEND </p><p>ONLY THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENTS.  AT THE NEXT HEARING ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 21, THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED WEAPONS, INCLUDING A </p><p>BASEBALL BAT AND AIR RIFLE, WHICH WERE RULED INADMISSIBLE BY </p><p>THE JUDGES.  THE PROSECUTION SAID THAT MAJOR OPERATIONS WERE </p><p>TO INCLUDE ATTACKING MOTORCADES OF SENIOR OFFICIALS; ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST THE SHEIKH OF AL-AZHAR, THE RADIO AND TV BUILDING, AN </p><p>UNDISCLOSED LOCATION HOUSING AMERICAN PILOTS AND ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST BOTH MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN PERSONALITIES.  THE </p><p>PROSECUTOR CHARGED THAT AL-WA\'AD RECENTLY COLLECTED $600,000, </p><p>WHICH WAS SENT TO A JORDANIAN RESIDENT IN THE UAE (MOHAMED </p><p>ALI, AKA ABU-HAMZAH), WHO RUNS THE AL-HARAMAYN CHARITY </p><p>FOUNDATION IN SAUDI ARABIA.  THROUGH THE UAE CONNECTIONS, </p><p>THEY FUNNELED MONEY TO THE CHECHEN RESISTANCE, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE PROSECUTION.  AL-WA\'AD SOUGHT TO INDOCTRINATE YOUNG </p><p>EGYPTIANS, TO RECRUIT THEM TO FIGHT IN CHECHENYA AND THE </p><p>BALKANS.  ONCE THEY DEVELOPED EXPERTISE, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>CLAIMS, THEY WOULD RETURN TO EGYPT TO CARRY OUT TERRORIST </p><p>OPERATIONS.  AL-AHRAM AL-ARABY NEWSPAPER CLAIMED THE GROUP </p><p>HAD CLOSE RELATIONS WITH HAMMAS AND ON 12/2 REPORTED A </p><p>MEETING BETWEEN A HAMMAS OFFICIAL AND DEFENDANT NASHAT AT </p><p>WHICH HE RECEIVED A LIST OF REQUESTED MATERIEL, INCLUDING </p><p>MACHINE GUNS AND ANTI-TANK ARTILLERY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>THE PLOT THICKENS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AS THE GOVERNMENT BUILT ITS CASE AGAINST AL-WA\'AD </p><p>MEMBERS, IT REVEALED THAT THE ORGANIZATION WAS DIVIDED INTO </p><p>CLUSTER CELLS.  MEMBERS CAME FROM THE ELITES AND EDUCATED </p><p>CLASSES. FUNDS WERE COLLECTED FROM WORSHIPPERS AT TWO LARGE </p><p>MOSQUES AS WELL AS DONATIONS FROM BUSINESSMEN THEY RECRUITED. </p><p> NASHAT IBRAHIM REPORTEDLY PAID EXPENSES FOR MEMBERS TO </p><p>RECEIVE TRAINING AT CHECHEN RESISTANCE CAMPS, IN KASHMIR AND </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  A DAGASTANI EXPLOSIVES EXPERT, REGISTERED IN </p><p>THE MEDICAL FACULTY AT AL-AZHAR TRAINED MEMBERS IN CAIRO AND </p><p>ALEXANDRIA TO PLANT CAR BOMBS AND OTHER DEVICES.  TWO </p><p>DEFENDANTS ALLEGEDLY CONFESSED TO BELONGING TO THE GAMA\'AT </p><p>ISLAMIYYA SINCE THE MID-1990\'S.  THREE OF THE DEFENDANTS </p><p>ALLEGEDLY RECEIVED CIVIL AVIATION TRAINING IN THE U.S.: </p><p>MUHAMMAD HISHAM SAYF AL-DIN, HUSAM ZAKARIYA ABDUL SALAM, AND </p><p>MUHAMMAD MAHMUD NUR-AL-DIN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN ITS THIRD SESSION ON DECEMBER 3, AT WHICH THE </p><p>MILITARY TRIBUNAL HEARD TESTIMONY FROM THE INVESTIGATING </p><p>OFFICER, WHO SAID THE GROUP HAD BEEN STUDYING THE MOVEMENT OF </p><p>THE PRESIDENT\'S MOTORCADE, PREPARING TO BLOW IT UP.  DEFENSE </p><p>ATTORNEYS REQUESTED THE PRESENCE OF THE MUFTI OF THE </p><p>REPUBLIC, PRESIDENT OF AL-AZHAR UNIVERSITY, AND DEAN OF THE </p><p>RELIGION FACULTY AS WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENSE.  DEFENSE </p><p>ATTORNEYS CLAIMED THE COPY OF THE CASE WAS ILLEGIBLE AND </p><p>REQUESTED THE HEARING BE HALTED UNTIL A CLEAR COPY COULD BE </p><p>OBTAINED.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT DECIDED TO GIVE LAWYERS </p><p>ACCESS TO THE ORIGINAL OF THE CASE DOCUMENTS WHILE CONTINUING </p><p>THE CASE.  THE ATTORNEY FOR EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN MUHAMMAD HISHAM </p><p>SAYF AL-DIN REQUESTED A MEDICAL EXAMINATION FOR EVIDENCE OF </p><p>TORTURE.  OTHERS ASKED TO BE HOSPITALIZED FOR DETERIORATING </p><p>HEALTH CONDITIONS.  THE COURT ACCEPTED THE DEFENSE APPEALS </p><p>AND AGREED TO REQUEST AN AL-AZHAR COMMITTEE EXAMINE BOOKS </p><p>FOUND IN THE POSSESSION OF THE ACCUSED TO JUDGE THEIR </p><p>CONFORMITY WITH ISLAMIC LEGISLATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) CROSS EXAMINATION OF PROSECUTION WITNESSES BY DEFENSE </p><p>ATTORNEYS TOOK UP THE NEXT TWO (DECEMBER 4 AND 6) SESSIONS. </p><p>DURING THESE SESSIONS A LINK BETWEEN JORDANIAN ABU HAMZA AND </p><p>DEFENDANT MAGDI IDRIS BECAME CLEAR.  THE FORMER SERVED AS THE </p><p>LINK BETWEEN AL-WA\'AD CELLS AND TRAINING CAMPS ABROAD, MAKING </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEIR MOVEMENTS.  DEFENSE ATTORNEYS CHARGED </p><p>THAT THEIR DEFENDANTS WERE TORTURED AND THEIR CONFESSIONS, </p><p>MADE UNDER DURESS, WERE INVALID.  ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT </p><p>DAILY, AL-AHRAM (12/6) THE PROSECUTION INTRODUCED ONLY 21 </p><p>PIECES OF EVIDENCE, SPECIFICALLY RELIGIOUS BOOKS AND DRAWINGS </p><p>FOR TARGET PRACTICE, WHILE THE INDICTMENT INDICATES 150 </p><p>PIECES OF EVIDENCE, INCLUDING WEAPONS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>SKEPTICS VIEW THE CASE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE REFERRAL OF THIS CASE TO A MILITARY TRIBUNAL HAS </p><p>RAISED SUSPICIONS AND SOME CONCERNS IN EGYPT.  THE ABSENCE OF </p><p>CONCRETE EVIDENCE AND CREDIBLE WEAPONS FURTHER WEAKENS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S CASE AND HEIGHTENS SUSPICIONS AS TO WHETHER THIS </p><p>IS A SHOW TRIAL.  SOME BELIEVE THAT INTRODUCING THE CASE IN </p><p>THE MILITARY TRIBUNAL WAS A POST-9/11 DEMONSTRATION OF </p><p>EGYPT\'S CONCRETE RESOLVE TO DEAL WITH TERRORISM.  DEFENSE </p><p>ATTORNEY HAFEZ ABU SAADA CLAIMED THAT THE CASE WOULD HAVE </p><p>ENDED IN ACQUITTAL IN AN ORDINARY COURT OF LAW.  THIS, HE </p><p>SAID, IS LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN A MILITARY PROCEEDING, </p><p>WHERE THE JUDGES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GOVERNMENT PRESSURE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) PROMINENT ARAB JOURNALIST MOHAMED SALAH BELIEVES THAT </p><p>THE MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP DID INDEED VIOLATE THE LAW IN </p><p>SOLICITING AND ACCEPTING DONATIONS WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM </p><p>THE GOE, IN VIOLATION OF THE 1992 MILITARY ORDER TO THAT </p><p>EFFECT.  WHAT PROVIDED THIS GROUP A RADICAL ISLAMIC TINT WAS </p><p>THE FACT THAT SOME OF THOSE INVOLVED HAD BEEN MEMBERS OF </p><p>RADICAL ISLAMIST GROUPS IN THE PAST. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) WHILE WE AGREE THAT THE EVIDENCE IS SCANT AND THE </p><p>MAKINGS OF A PUTSCH UNLIKELY SO FAR, THE GOVERNMENT IN OUR </p><p>VIEW, WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROUP\'S POTENTIAL.  THEY </p><p>WERE ALREADY BREAKING THE LAW BY COLLECTING AND SENDING LARGE </p><p>AMOUNTS OF CASH AND PROCURING WEAPONS TO BE SENT TO CHECHNYA </p><p>AND PALESTINIAN HAMMAS BOTH OF WHICH ARE EMOTIONAL AS WELL AS </p><p>POLITICAL CONCERNS FOR MANY ARAB MUSLIMS.  THE ABSENCE OF </p><p>EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE MAY DEMONSTRATE THE DIFFICULTY OF </p><p>TRACING FUNDS, PARTICULARLY CASH CONTRIBUTIONS, IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARENA.  WHILE WE SEE NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS </p><p>GROUP AND AL-QAEDA, WE CANNOT RULE OUT THAT IT WAS AN </p><p>OFFSHOOT OF ANOTHER INTERNATIONAL GROUP.  CERTAINLY, LOCAL </p><p>TERRORIST ELEMENTS, OR CELLS, RECEIVING MILITARY AND </p><p>EXPLOSIVES TRAINING ABROAD, COULD USE THAT EXPERTISE </p><p>INTERNALLY, AS THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS.  PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S </p><p>EFFORTS OVER THE PAST YEAR TO TURN THE FOCUS BACK TO PEACE AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME THE ISRAELIS ARE PERCEIVED AS BEING AT WAR WITH </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS, HAVE NOT MADE HIM MORE POPULAR.  THAT IS </p><p>PARTICULARLY TRUE AMONG THOSE WHO FEEL A NEED TO HELP DEFEND </p><p>MUSLIMS AGAINST OCCUPATION FORCES, WHICH THEY VIEW AS </p><p>"LEGITIMATE JIHAD". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WELCH </p><p></p></div>
