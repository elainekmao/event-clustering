AS AN ILLUSTRATION, </p><p>HE SAID, AN ARAB HAD CAME TO NANGARHAR IN LATE JULY WITH </p><p>EXPLOSIVES. HE SAID THAT THE ARAB WAS LOOKING FOR SUPPORT </p><p>AMONG AFGHANS FOR HIS INTENDED TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY SUPPORT. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE </p><p>ARAB WAS KILLED, APPARENTLY BY ONE OF HIS OWN BOMBS. </p><p> </p><p>4.

SADAQAT SAID THAT BIN LADEN HAD SENT A </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE TO JALALABAD TO ASK THE NANGARHAR SHURA </p><p>(COUNCIL) FOR SAFEHAVEN FOR BIN LADEN.  THE COUNCIL MET IN </p><p>LATE JULY-EARLY AUGUST; IT DECIDED THAT BIN LADEN WOULD NOT </p><p>BE ALLOWED TO WORK OR LIVE IN THEIR TERRITORY.

HE </p><p>RECOUNTED A RUMOR THAT SOME ARABS HAD MOVED TO PAGHMAN IN </p><p>ORDER TO BE NEARER THE KABUL AUTHORITIES, HELP THEM WITH </p><p>FOOD SUPPLIES, AND OTHERWISE EASE THEIR BURDEN. (COMMENT: </p><p>KABUL HAS BEEN UNDER SEIGE BY THE TALL BAN SINCE LAST </p><p>OCTOBER. JUST TWO DAYS AGO, THE ROAD TO MAIDAN SHAHR WAS </p><p>CUT DUE TO FIGHTING BETWEEN PRO-KABUL TROOPS AND THE </p><p>TALIBAN. THE ROAD IS A MAJOR ARTERY FOR FOODSTUFFS,  FUEL, </p><p>LIVESTOCK AND OTHER NECESSITIES REACHING KABUL. END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6.
