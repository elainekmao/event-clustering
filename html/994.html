<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 CAIRO 002104 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR SUTPHIN, PARIS FOR LEAF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 3/11/09 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PTER, PGOV, PREL, KISL, PHUM, ECON, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  EGYPT\'S MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AT LOW EBB </p><p> </p><p>REF:  98 CAIRO 8147 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY ECONOMIC-POLITICAL MINISTER </p><p>COUNSELOR RICHARD LEBARON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SINCE 1995, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN </p><p>PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES CONTROLLED BY THE MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD AND ARRESTED THEIR ACTIVISTS, THE </p><p>BROTHERHOOD HAS REMAINED QUIET, ISSUING ONLY AN </p><p>OCCASIONAL PUBLIC STATEMENT ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES. </p><p>BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT MOLLIFIED.  IT EMBARKS ON </p><p>CAMPAIGNS OF ARRESTS OF MB MEMBERS, AND PUBLICIZES THE </p><p>ARRESTS, IN ORDER TO PREVENT AND DETER MB ACTIVISM IN </p><p>THE RUN-UP TO NATION-WIDE ELECTIONS.  AFTER RELEASING </p><p>LAST YEAR A GROUP OF 31 MB ACTIVISTS FROM THE 1995 </p><p>ROUND-UPS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ARRESTED ANOTHER 110 </p><p>SINCE LAST AUGUST.  THE ARRESTS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE AS </p><p>THE COUNTRY PREPARES FOR THE OCTOBER 1999 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>REFERENDUM ON MUBARAK\'S FOURTH TERM. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE MB IS FURTHER PLAGUED BY INTERNAL DIVISIONS </p><p>ALONG GENERATIONAL LINES, WITH THE YOUNGER ACTIVISTS </p><p>(THE TARGETS OF THE GOE ARRESTS) WANTING A GREATER ROLE </p><p>IN THE DECISION-MAKING, AND BY THE EGYPTIAN MB\'S </p><p>WEAKENING TIES WITH SISTER ORGANIZATIONS IN OTHER ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES.   DESPITE THESE WEAKNESSES, THE MB REMAINS </p><p>EGYPT\'S LARGEST AND BEST ORGANIZED OPPOSITION MOVEMENT. </p><p>OUR MB CONTACTS COMPLAIN OF THE SECURITY CRACKDOWNS, </p><p>DENY ANY LINKS WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS AND PROFESS </p><p>THEIR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC POLICIES AND PRACTICES. </p><p>WE SHOULD HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ON THE LAST POINT.  IN THE </p><p>MB IDEOLOGY, GOD\'S LAW TRUMPS DEMOCRACY, AND GOD\'S LAW </p><p>AS THEY INTERPRET IT DOES NOT FAVOR HERETICAL VIEWS, </p><p>WOMEN\'S PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT, OR EQUAL RIGHTS </p><p>FOR NON-MUSLIMS IN AN ISLAMIC SOCIETY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>MB INTERNAL STRUCTURE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACCORDING TO EGYPTIAN EXPERTS ON THE MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD, THE MB HAS TWO GOVERNING BODIES IN EGYPT. </p><p>THE "GUIDANCE BUREAU" OF 14 OFFICIALS RUNS DAY-TO-DAY </p><p>AFFAIRS.  ITS CURRENT SUPREME GUIDE (MUSTAFA MASHOUR) </p><p>HAS TWO DEPUTIES:  ONE (MA\'MOUN AL-HODEIBY) SERVES AS </p><p>SPOKESMAN AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS, </p><p>WHILE THE OTHER (A SYRIAN NAMED HASAN HOWEIDY WHO HAS </p><p>LIVED IN EGYPT SINCE THE EARLY 1980\'S) LIASES WITH MB </p><p>BRANCHES IN OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES.  THE GUIDANCE BUREAU </p><p>INCLUDES THOSE IN CHARGE OF SYNDICATES, UNIVERSITIES, </p><p>FAMILIES, AND OTHERS IN CONTACT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY.  THE MB\'S LEADERSHIP IN EGYPT, WHERE THE </p><p>GROUP WAS FOUNDED IN 1927 AND FIRST BECAME POPULAR, </p><p>REMAINS IN THEORY ALSO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, ALTHOUGH IN PRACTICE THE </p><p>BRANCHES ELSEWHERE HAVE BECOME DE FACTO INDEPENDENT. </p><p>MB CONTACTS HERE SAY THE OTHER BRANCHES HAVE BY </p><p>NECESSITY EVOLVED SEPARATELY GIVEN THE DIFFERING </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES IN EACH COUNTRY.  NEVERTHLESS, THE OTHERS </p><p>"COORDINATE" WITH THE MOTHER ORGANIZATION IN CAIRO, AND </p><p>AT THE TOP OF THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION THE </p><p>SUPREME GUIDE IS ALWAYS AN EGYPTIAN.   MB SOURCES HERE </p><p>NOTE THAT MANY OF THE OTHER MB GROUPS OPERATE IN A </p><p>FREER ENVIRONEMENT, PARTICULARLY THE ONE IN JORDAN. </p><p>THEY INCLUDE, IN ADDITION TO JORDANIAN AND SYRIAN MB, </p><p>YEMEN\'S ISLAH PARTY, PALESTINIAN HAMAS, AND ALGERIAN </p><p>HAMAS AS MB AFFILIATES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE OTHER GOVERNING BODY IS A "SHURA COUNCIL" OF </p><p>38 MEMBERS, WHICH MEETS PERIODICALLY TO REVIEW REPORTS </p><p>FROM THE GUIDANCE BUREAU AND SETS OVERALL POLICY.  IT </p><p>INCLUDES A MINORITY OF NON-EGYPTIAN MEMBERS.  IN THEORY </p><p>IT ELECTS THE BUREAU OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE SUPREME </p><p>GUIDE WHO COMES UP FOR ELECTION EVERY SIX YEARS.  BUT </p><p>IN PRACTICE, MUSTAFA MASHOUR WAS CHOSEN AS SUPREME </p><p>GUIDE IN 1995 WITHOUT ELECTIONS.  THE GUIDANCE BUREAU </p><p>SELECTED MASHOUR BECAUSE, AT 74 YEARS OF AGE, HE WAS </p><p>THE SENIOR MEMBER OF THE MB\'S FOUNDING GENERATION, </p><p>ACCORDING TO OUR MB SOURCES.  THE MB IS SUPPOSED TO </p><p>HOLD ELECTIONS FOR THE SHURA COUNCIL AT THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>LEVEL (IN EGYPT) AND NATIONAL LEVEL (FOR THE OTHER ARAB </p><p>BRANCHES), BUT MB MEMBERS HAVE TOLD US THAT IT HAS </p><p>POSTPONED SHURA ELECTIONS IN EGYPT FOR SEVERAL YEARS </p><p>BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT SECURITY PRESSURE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>MB THEORY AND PRACTICE:  NO ILLUSIONS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE MB PRESENTS ITSELF TO BOTH WESTERNERS AND </p><p>EGYPTIANS AS COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, INCLUDING </p><p>INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS SUCH AS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.  OUR </p><p>MB INTERLOCUTORS STRESS THAT THE ORGANIZATION WANTS TO </p><p>REFORM EGYPT\'S CURRENT SYSTEM (TERMED SOMEWHAT CORRUPT </p><p>AND INCOMPLETELY ISLAMIC) GRADUALLY BY WORKING THROUGH </p><p>GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY.  THEY SAY AN MB GOVERNMENT WOULD </p><p>WILLINGLY CEDE POWER IF, ONCE ELECTED TO OFFICE, IT </p><p>WERE SUBSEQUENTLY TO LOSE AN ELECTION.   IN FACT, MB </p><p>SHURA COUNCIL MEMBER (AND JOURNALIST SYNDICATE BOARD </p><p>MEMBER) SALAH ABDEL MAQSUD TOLD US THAT THE MB PREFERS </p><p>NOT TO BE IN POWER, BUT INSTEAD SEEKS TO INFLUENCE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT COMPLETELY ISLAMIC POLICIES.  HE </p><p>CITES MB FOUNDER HASAN AL-BANNA WHO REPORTEDLY SAID, </p><p>WHEN ASKED, THAT HE DIDN\'T WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>EGYPT, HE JUST WANTED THE PRESIDENT TO IMPLEMENT AN </p><p>ISLAMIC PROGRAM.  WE RECENTLY OBSERVED AN MB </p><p>PRESENTATION TO A SECULAR EGYPTIAN AUDIENCE, DURING A </p><p>REGULAR WEEKLY GATHERING HOSTED BY A LOCAL NGO.  THE </p><p>SPEAKER CAREFULLY PITCHED A NATIONALISTIC RATHER THAN </p><p>RELIGIOUS APPEAL, STRESSING THAT EGYPT\'S ACHIEVEMENTS, </p><p>WHETHER IN THE ECONOMY OR FOREIGN POLICY OR BUILDING </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE, ARE ACHIEVEMENTS FOR ISLAM, SINCE EGYPT </p><p>IS AN ISLAMIC COUNTRY.   WE ARE FOR EVERYTHING THAT </p><p>MAKES EGYPT STRONG, HE CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ON THE OTHER HAND, EXAMINATION OF SPECIFIC MB </p><p>PRACTICES AND POLICIES BELIES THIS STATED COMMITMENT TO </p><p>DEMOCRATIC NORMS. AS THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATE, </p><p>DEMOCRACY IS FINE AS LONG AS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>GOD\'S LAW, BUT GOD\'S LAW AS INTERPRETED BY THE MB </p><p>TRUMPS ALL. </p><p> </p><p>-- FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION:  MB SPOKESMAN HODEIBY AND </p><p>OTHER MB FIGURES WERE IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE 1995 </p><p>CAMPAIGN TO DECLARE CAIRO UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR NASR ABU </p><p>ZEID AN "APOSTATE" FOR HIS WRITINGS ON MODERN </p><p>INTERPRETATIONS OF ISLAM.  IN ADDITION, MB MEMBERS IN </p><p>THE PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES FAVOR SYNDICATE </p><p>DISCIPLINARY EFFORTS (E.G. STRIPPING OF PROFESSIONAL </p><p>CREDENTIALS) FOR MEMBERS WHO ADVOCATE GREATER CONTACTS </p><p>WITH ISRAELIS.  THE MB\'S PROFESSED INTEREST IN FREEDOM </p><p>OF EXPRESSION REMAINS LIMITED TO ITS ABILITY TO FURTHER </p><p>ITS OWN IDEOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>-- WOMEN\'S RIGHTS:  WOMEN CAN IN THEORY VOTE IN THE MB </p><p>SHURA ELECTIONS AND STAND FOR ELECTION.  IN PRACTICE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO MB SOURCES, WOMEN HAVE NEVER PARTICIPATED </p><p>IN EITHER THE SHURA OR GUIDANCE OFFICE (WE UNDERSTAND, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT IN THE YEMEN AND JORDAN MB, A FEW WOMEN </p><p>HAVE JOINED THE NATIONAL-LEVEL SHURA COUNCILS.)   THE </p><p>ONLY EVEN SEMI-PROMINENT MB WOMAN RECALLED BY OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS IN EGYPT IS ZEINAB AL-GHAZZALI (DAUGHTER </p><p>OF THE LATE MB SHEIKH MUHAMMAD AL-GHAZZALI).   SHE </p><p>HOLDS NO OFFICIAL POSITION IN THE MB. </p><p> </p><p>--ATTITUDE TOWARDS ISRAEL:  DESPITE ITS STATED </p><p>ADHERENCE TO NON-VIOLENT SOLUTIONS, THE MB HAS NOT </p><p>ACCEPTED THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT\'S PEACE TREATY WITH </p><p>ISRAEL.  IT CALLS FOR ARMED STRUGGLE TO LIBERATE </p><p>JERUSALEM AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. ITS PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS ON THIS ISSUE HAVE INCREASINGLY CRITICIZED </p><p>THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTED HAMAS.  FOR </p><p>INSTANCE, THE MB STATEMENT AFTER THE WYE RIVER </p><p>AGREEMENT (AS PUBLISHED IN THE OPPOSITION AL-SHAAB </p><p>NEWSPAPER OF OCTOBER 27) CONDEMNED THE PA\'S ARRESTS OF </p><p>ISLAMISTS IN GAZA AND CALLED THE PA "A TOOL FOR </p><p>SUPPRESSING THE PALESTINIANS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO CIVIL </p><p>WAR."  INSIDE EGYPT, THE MB STRONGLY REJECTS ANY </p><p>NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAELIS AS NOTED ABOVE. LEADER OF </p><p>THE MB SPLINTER WASAT GROUP ABUL ELA AL-MADI TOLD US </p><p>"NORMALIZATION"  SHOULD MEAN NO ISRAEL SINCE </p><p>ELIMINATION OF THAT "ARTIFICIAL ENTITY" WOULD BE FOR </p><p>HIM THE "NORMAL" CONDITION. </p><p> </p><p>-- POSITION OF MINORITIES:  THE MOST FAMOUS LIVING MB </p><p>SCHOLAR IS YUSUF AL-QARDAWI, AN EGYPTIAN NOW LIVING IN </p><p>QATAR, CONSIDERED BY SOME WESTERN SCHOLARS TO BE A </p><p>MODERATE IN THE FUNDAMENTALIST SPECTRUM.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>THE QARDAWI WHOSE BOOKS AND TAPED LECTURES WE FIND IN </p><p>CAIRO IS NO MODERATE.  FOR INSTANCE, HE SUPPORTS RE- </p><p>IMPOSING THE TRADITIONAL ISLAMIC TAX ON NON-MUSLIMS </p><p>LIVING IN AN ISLAMIC COUNTRY (CALLED THE "JIZYA" TAX). </p><p>HIS BOOK "NON-MUSLIMS IN ISLAMIC COUNTRIES" COMMENTS </p><p>CRITICALLY ON THE EMPHASIS PLACED BY SOME ARAB </p><p>GOVERNMENTS (READ THE GOE) ON INTERFAITH TOLERANCE, </p><p>MISPLACED IN QARDAWI\'S EYES TO THE EXTENT THAT IT </p><p>CONFLICTS WITH GOD\'S LAW.  QARDAWI WRITES:  "IT IS NOT </p><p>TOLERANCE TO FORCE MUSLIMS TO ABANDON GOD\'S LAW FOR THE </p><p>SAKE OF SPARING THE FEELINGS OF NON-MUSLIM MINORITIES. </p><p>WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY A CHRISTIAN OR JEW SHOULD BE </p><p>OFFENDED BY THE AMPUTATION OF A THIEF\'S HAND, OR THE </p><p>FLOGGING OF SLANDERERS, ADULTERERS OR DRUNKS... A </p><p>MUSLIM OBEYS THESE RULES AS AN ACT OF WORSHIP, WHILE A </p><p>NON-MUSLIM, WHO DOESN\'T UNDERSTAND THEIR DIVINE NATURE, </p><p>SHOULD TAKE THEM TO BE MERELY THE CRIMINAL LAW OF THE </p><p>LAND ADOPTED BY THE MAJORITY."  SUPREME GUIDE MASHOUR, </p><p>IN A 1997 AL-AHRAM INTERVIEW, LIKEWISE SUPPORTED </p><p>IMPOSING THE JIZYA TAX ON EGYPT\'S COPTIC MINORITY </p><p>(THOUGH HE LATER DENIED MAKING THE REMARKS). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES - THE LOST MB STRONGHOLDS STAY </p><p>QUIET </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) SOME EGYPTIAN OBSERVERS OF THE MB AGREE THAT </p><p>WHILE ITS PRACTICES ARE NOT DEMOCRATIC, THE MB\'S </p><p>YOUNGER GENERATION MAY OVER TIME GAIN POLITICAL </p><p>EXPERIENCE AND EVOLVE AWAY FROM THEOCRATIC THEORY </p><p>TOWARDS A MORE PRACTICAL ACCEPTANCE OF POLITICS IN A </p><p>SECULAR STATE (ALONG THE LINES, SAY THESE OBSERVERS, OF </p><p>CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTIES IN WESTERN EUROPE).  IN </p><p>SUPPORT OF THIS ARGUMENT, THESE OBSERVERS POINT </p><p>PARTICULARLY TO THE MB\'S EXPERIENCE OF RUNNING SEVERAL </p><p>OF EGYPT\'S PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES FROM 1992-95.  THEY </p><p>CITE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE MB\'S POTENTIAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC TENDENCIES AND ACTUAL COALITION BUILDING </p><p>ABILITIES.  PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES HAVE BEEN AN </p><p>IMPORTANT NON-GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTION IN EGYPTIAN </p><p>PUBLIC LIFE SINCE THE 1920\'S.  WHILE THEIR TRADITIONAL </p><p>FOCUS WAS ON REGULATING PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND </p><p>PROVIDING MEMBER SERVICES, THE SYNDICATES HAVE ALWAYS </p><p>BEEN A FORUM TO DISCUSS POLITICAL ISSUES.  IN NASSER\'S </p><p>ERA THEY WERE USED POLITICALLY TO RALLY "POPULAR" </p><p>SUPPORT FOR GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS.  UNDER SADAT, THEY </p><p>WERE A REFUGE FOR LEFTIST CRITICS OF THE REGIME.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE SYNDICATES ARE OFTEN A STEPPING STONE TO </p><p>A POLITICAL CAREER FOR GOVERNMENT-APPROVED CANDIDATES </p><p>(E.G., FORMER PRIME MINISTER MUSTAFA KHALIL ROSE UP </p><p>THROUGH THE ENGINEERS SYNDICATE). </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) IN THE LATE 1980\'S AND EARLY 1990\'S THE MB USED </p><p>ITS ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL ABILITIES TO GET OUT </p><p>ITS VOTE IN SYNDICATE BOARD ELECTIONS.   SINCE </p><p>SYNDICATE MEMBERS MUST CAST BALLOTS EITHER IN CAIRO </p><p>SYNDICATE HEADQUARTERS, OR IN CAPITALS OF REGIONAL </p><p>PROVINCES, THE MB BUSSED IN THEIR SYNDICATE MEMBERS AND </p><p>OTHER SYMPATHIZERS FROM THE PROVINCES ON ELECTION DAY. </p><p>SYNDICATE MEMBERS MUST PAY DUES, AND ANOTHER MB </p><p>TECHNIQUE OF THE TIME WAS TO AGREE TO PAY A MEMBER\'S </p><p>DUES IN EXCHANGE FOR A PRO-MB VOTE IN THE SYNDICATE </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THE RESULT:  THE MB CAPTURED PLURALITIES OF </p><p>THE GOVERNING BOARDS OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS SYNDICATES </p><p>- THE LAWYERS, ENGINEERS, DOCTORS, AND PHARMACISTS. THE </p><p>MB CONTROLLED THE SYNDICATES BY SUPPORTING A NEUTRAL OR </p><p>PRO-GOVERNMENT CANDIDATE FOR THE TOP POSITION, WHILE </p><p>KEEPING THE DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS AND RUNNING </p><p>THE SYNDICATES THROUGH COALITIONS WITH OTHER OPPOSITION </p><p>AND INDEPENDENT FIGURES. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  AFTER THE MB GAINED CONTROL OF THE SYNDICATES, </p><p>THE GOE RESPONDED FIRST BY CHANGING THE SYNDICATE </p><p>ELECTION LAWS IN 1992 TO REQUIRE SUPER MAJORITIES, AND </p><p>THEN IN LATE 1995 BY ABOLISHING THE MB-RUN BOARDS OF </p><p>SEVERAL SYNDICATES AND REPLACING THEM WITH GOE- </p><p>APPOINTED GUARDIANS.  THE GUARDIANS ARE SUPPOSED TO </p><p>TEMPORARILY LOOK AFTER SYNDICATE AFFAIRS AND PREPARE </p><p>FOR NEW ELECTIONS.  IN JUSTIFYING THESE MOVES, THE GOE </p><p>MADE TWO CLAIMS:  THE MB EMBEZZLED SYNDICATE FUNDS, AND </p><p>THE MB WAS USING THE SYNDICATES TO PROMOTE THEIR OWN </p><p>POLITICAL AGENDA.  AHMAD SEIF AL-ISLAM HASSAN AL-BANNA, </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE LAWYERS SYNDICATE DURING THE </p><p>PERIOD OF MB CONTROL (AND SON OF THE MB FOUNDER), </p><p>ADMITTED TO US THERE WERE SOME FINANCIAL ERRORS MADE </p><p>DURING THE MB TENURE, BUT HE VEHEMENTLY DENIED THAT </p><p>THIS JUSTIFIED THE GOE SHUTTING DOWN THE INDEDEPENDENT </p><p>SYNDICATES.  THE ONLY FINANCIAL DETAILS CITED TO US IN </p><p>MEETINGS WITH SYNDICATE MEMBERS ARE THAT SOME SYNDICATE </p><p>CONTRACTS (PRINTING LEAFLETS OR ARRANGING SYNDICATE </p><p>MEMBER TRAVEL) WERE GIVEN TO COMPANIES OWNED BY MB </p><p>MEMBERS.  THE MORE SERIOUS CHARGE IS THAT THE </p><p>SYNDICATES BECAME MB POLITICAL PLATFORMS.  AS NOTED </p><p>ABOVE, SYNDICATES HAVE ALWAYS HAD A POLITICAL VOICE, </p><p>BUT THIS VOICE APPARENTLY BECAME INTOLERABLY ANTI- </p><p>REGIME DURING THE PERIOD OF MB CONTROL.  HAMDI SAYYID, </p><p>CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE DOCTORS SYNDICATE AND RULING </p><p>PARTY MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, DETAILED FOR US HOW </p><p>POLITICS (E.G., BOSNIA OR THE GOE COUNTER-TERROR </p><p>CAMPAIGN) BECAME THE DOCTORS\' OVERRIDING ISSUES DURING </p><p>THE MB TENURE, TO THE NEGLECT OF PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS </p><p>AND MEMBER SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) SINCE 1995, THE SYNDICATES HAVE GROWN QUIET, </p><p>HOLDING ONLY THE OCCASIONAL SMALL-SCALE PROTESTS OF </p><p>U.S. POLICY DURING IRAQ CRISES.  THE TWO MOST </p><p>POLITICALLY VOCAL DURING THE MB TENURE - THE LAWYERS </p><p>AND ENGINEERS - REMAIN UNDER GOE GUARDIANSHIP, WITH NO </p><p>DATES YET FOR FOR NEW BOARD ELECTIONS.  SPECULATION ON </p><p>IMMINENT LAWYERS SYNDICATE ELECTIONS HAS CIRCULATED IN </p><p>THE PRESS AND AMONG LAWYERS FOR MONTHS.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL FRONT-RUNNER, RAGA\'I ATIYAH (MUBARAK </p><p>FAMILY PERSONAL LAWYER), IS RUMORED TO HAVE FORMED A </p><p>COALITION WITH THE MB LAWYERS WHEREBY THEY WILL SUPPORT </p><p>HIM FOR PRESIDENT IN EXCHANGE FOR THE GOE\'S ALLOWING </p><p>THE MB A CERTAIN SPECIFIED NUMBER OF SEATS ON THE </p><p>BOARD.  WAFD PARTY COMPETITORS TOLD US THIS RUMORED </p><p>COALITION FELL APART WHEN, AT A RECENT JOINT MEETING OF </p><p>THE ATIYAH BACKERS AND MB LAWYERS, IT BECAME CLEAR TO </p><p>THE GOE SECURITY SERVICES THAT THE MB WOULD DOMINATE </p><p>THIS COALITION.  THE LATEST WORD IS THAT LAWYERS </p><p>SYNDICATE ELECTIONS MUST WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE OCTOBER </p><p>1999 REFERENDUM ON MUBARAK\'S FOURTH TERM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:  QUIET ISN\'T GOOD ENOUGH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) IN 1995, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT WAS SHUTTING DOWN </p><p>THE MB-CONTROLLED SYNDICATES, IT ALSO ARRESTED SEVERAL </p><p>HUNDRED MB MEMBERS FROM SYNDICATES AND UNIVERSITIES, </p><p>BUNDLING 82 OF THEM THROUGH EXPEDITED TRIALS IN THE </p><p>MILITARY COURT SYSTEM.  THE MAIN CHARGES WERE BELONGING </p><p>TO A BANNED GROUP (THE MB IS NOT A LEGAL ENTITY IN </p><p>EGYPT) AND WORKING AGAINST THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. </p><p>IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT CHARGED MANY WITH CONTACTS </p><p>WITH "JIHAD" AND "ISLAMIC GROUP" TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS (THUS FURTHER JUSTIFYING THE RESORT TO </p><p>THE MILITARY COURTS ON NATIONAL SECURITY GROUNDS).  IN </p><p>THE FIRST OF TWO TRIALS IN NOVEMBER 1995, 31 MB MEMBERS </p><p>WERE SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON, THREE OTHERS </p><p>WERE SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS AND 15 WERE ACQUITTED </p><p>(CASE NO. 95/8).  IN THE OTHER CASE, 17 WERE SENTENCED </p><p>TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON AND THREE MORE TO FIVE YEARS, </p><p>WITH 13 ACQUITTALS (CASE NO. 95/11). </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) A NEW GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN OF MB ARRESTS BEGAN </p><p>SEVEN MONTHS AGO, WITH A TOTAL OF 110 SUSPECTED MB </p><p>MEMBERS ARRESTED TO DATE, ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS. </p><p>THOSE ARRESTED ARE BEING HELD IN DETENTION WITHOUT </p><p>TRIAL, WHICH IS ALLOWED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO SIX MONTHS </p><p>UNDER THE POST-1981 EMERGENCY LAWS (THOUGH IN PRACTICE </p><p>SUCH DETENTION CAN OCCUR FOR YEARS).  THE CAMPAIGN IS </p><p>NATION-WIDE THOUGH FOCUSED ON MB CENTERS IN THE DELTA, </p><p>CAIRO AND ALEXANDRIA:  IN THE DELTA PROVINCE OF KAFR </p><p>AL-SHEIKH, 16 PERSONS WERE ARRESTED BETWEEN AUGUST AND </p><p>OCTOBER (ALL BUT ONE WERE RECENTLY RELEASED); IN </p><p>ALEXANDRIA, 11 WERE ARRESTED IN OCTOBER AND ANOTHER </p><p>NINE IN FEBRUARY; IN GIZA, FIVE WERE ARRESTED IN </p><p>FEBRUARY.  THE EGYPTIAN ORGANIZATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>(EOHR) HAS COMPILED DATA ON THESE RECENT ARRESTEES, </p><p>GATHERING TESTIMONY AND ALLEGING INCIDENTS OF TORTURE </p><p>AND MALTREATMENT BY THE STATE SECURITY FORCES DURING </p><p>THE INTERROGATIONS.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOE HAS </p><p>RELEASED ALL OF THE 48 MB MEMBERS SENTENCED IN NOVEMBER </p><p>1995 TO THREE-YEAR PRISON TERMS. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) THE EOHR REPORT PROVIDES NAMES, AGES, AND </p><p>OCCUPATIONS OF THE RECENT ARRESTEES.  THE CONSISTENT </p><p>PATTERN IS MIDDLE-INCOME MEN BETWEEN 30 TO 45 YEARS OF </p><p>AGE (PROFESSIONALS, HIGHER SALARIED LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>EMPLOYEES, MERCHANTS).  THUS FAR, WE HAVE SPOTTED AMONG </p><p>THE NEW ARRESTEES ONLY TWO FROM THE GROUP CONVICTED IN </p><p>1995 AND RELEASED IN 1998.  THEY ARE PROMINENT MB </p><p>ACTIVISTS IBRAHIM AL-ZAAFARANI (SECRETARY GENERAL OF </p><p>THE ALEXANDRIA CHAPTER OF THE DOCTORS SYNDICATE) AND </p><p>MUHAMMAD TAHA WAHDAN (PROFESSOR OF COMMERCE AT </p><p>ISMAILIYYA UNIVERSITY).  ZAAFARANI HAS BEEN RE-ARRESTED </p><p>AND RELEASED FROM DETENTION SEVERAL TIMES SINCE HIS </p><p>THREE-YEAR PRISON TERM ENDED IN JANUARY 1998. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) OBSERVERS HERE INTERPRET THESE ARRESTS AS THE </p><p>GOE\'S ONGOING EFFORTS TO DETER MB ACTIVISM PRIOR TO </p><p>UPCOMING ELECTIONS. THE LAST MAJOR ROUND-UP IN 1995 </p><p>PRECEDED THE NOVEMBER 1995 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS; A </p><p>MUCH SMALLER NUMBER OF MB ARRESTS PRECEDED EACH OF THE </p><p>1997 LOCAL COUNCIL AND 1998 SHURA COUNCIL ELECTIONS. </p><p>WE MAY NOW BE WITNESSING GOE PREVENTIVE EFFORTS PRIOR </p><p>TO THE OCTOBER 1999 PRESIDENTIAL REFERENDUM AND </p><p>PROSPECTIVE  SYNDICATE ELECTIONS.  SOME OBSERVERS </p><p>EXPECT THE GOE TO KEEP UP THIS PRESSURE THROUGH THE </p><p>NOVEMBER 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  THE MESSAGE </p><p>FROM THE GOE TO THE MB IS:  WE WILL NOT LET YOU RE- </p><p>BUILD, EVEN IF YOU ARE KEEPING QUIET.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ENSURES THAT ITS MESSAGE IS WELL DISSEMINATED BY </p><p>INFORMING THE PRESS OF THESE ARRESTS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>INTERNAL DIVISIONS ADD TO THEIR PROBLEMS </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.(C) THE GOE ARREST CAMPAIGNS UNIFORMLY TARGET THE </p><p>MID-RANGE CADRE OF THE MB, LEAVING THE SEPTUAGENARIANS </p><p>IN THE LEADERSHIP UNTOUCHED.  DIFFERENCES HAVE EMERGED </p><p>BETWEEN THESE NOW-LATE 30 SOMETHING ACTIVISTS (WHO LED </p><p>THE SYNDICATE TAKEOVERS IN THE EARLY 1990\'S) AND THE </p><p>OLD GUARD LEADERSHIP OVER ISSUES OF INTERNAL MANAGEMENT </p><p>AND POLICY.  WE HEARD FROM EGYPTIAN OBSERVERS THAT </p><p>SPOKESMAN HODEIBY FILLED SEVERAL VACANT POSITIONS IN </p><p>THE GUIDANCE BUREAU WITHOUT CONVENING A SHURA COUNCIL </p><p>MEETING, AS THE MB RULES STIPULATE.  ACCORDING TO THESE </p><p>OBSERVERS, THE YOUNGER GENERATION ALSO HOLDS MASHOUR </p><p>AND HODEIBY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WASAT GROUP\'S </p><p>DEFECTION.   IN 1996, ABOUT 70 YOUNGER MB ACTIVISTS </p><p>LEFT TO FORM THEIR OWN POLITICAL PARTY, CALLED THE </p><p>WASAT OR CENTER PARTY, AFTER MASHOUR REFUSED TO APPROVE </p><p>THEIR PARTY (REFTEL).  MANY OF THE ORIGINAL WASAT GROUP </p><p>HAS RETURNED TO THE MB BUT, ACCORDING TO MB OBSERVERS, </p><p>THEY CONTINUE TO FEEL LEFT OUT OF POLICY DECISION- </p><p>MAKING.  FINALLY, AT LEAST ONE OBSERVER (DIA RASHWAN OF </p><p>THE AL-AHRAM CENTER) SEES A GROWING RIFT BETWEEN THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN MB AND THE BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS IN OTHER ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES, ACCENTUATED BY THE SECURITY PRESSURES FELT </p><p>BY THE EGYPTIAN MB.  THE ORGANIZATIONS IN JORDAN, YEMEN </p><p>AND ALGERIA ARE RELATIVELY VIBRANT COMPARED TO THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN GROUP, AND SEEM LESS INCLINED TO FOLLOW </p><p>EGYPTIAN HOME OFFICE GUIDANCE.  FINALLY, OUR MB SOURCES </p><p>SOMEWHAT PARADOXICALLY DO NOT SPEAK WELL OF THE ONLY </p><p>ISLAMIST GOVERNMENT IN THE ARAB WORLD - SUDAN - SINCE </p><p>TURABI\'S NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT SEES ITSELF AS A </p><p>COMPETITOR TO THE MB, SEEKING TO ABSORB SUDAN\'S MB INTO </p><p>ITS OWN "FRONT." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) CONDITIONS ARE DIFFICULT FOR THE MB AT PRESENT. </p><p>THE GOE\'S DETERMINED OPPOSITION AND USE OF SECURITY </p><p>SERVICES AND EMERGENCY LAWS KEEPS THE PRESSURE ON.  THE </p><p>EGYPTIAN PUBLIC, AS AN EXHAUSTING BOUT OF ISLAMIST </p><p>TERRORISM WINDS DOWN, SEEMS LESS INTERESTED NOW THAN IT </p><p>WAS A DECADE AGO IN AN ISLAMIST MESSAGE, EVEN THE MB\'S </p><p>SOFT-SELL APPROACH.  NEVERTHELESS, THE MB RETAINS A </p><p>NATION-WIDE ORGANIZATION WITH ROOTS IN THE GROWING </p><p>RANKS OF URBAN PROFESSIONALS, AND IN THE SUEZ CANAL </p><p>CITIES (WHERE IT STARTED), ALEXANDRIA AND PARTS OF THE </p><p>DELTA.   THE MB TAKES A FAMOUSLY LONG VIEW OF ITS </p><p>PROSPECTS, AND IT WILL REMAIN THE LARGEST AND BEST </p><p>ORGANIZED OPPOSITION MOVEMENT IN EGYPT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>NOTE ON SOURCES </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) THE MB IS A BANNED GROUP IN EGYPT.   WHILE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT USED TO TOLERATE A MORE OPEN MB PRESENCE </p><p>(E.G., THE MB IN 1987 OPENLY JOINED AN OPPOSITION </p><p>COALITION FOR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS), SINCE 1995 IT </p><p>HAS STRICTLY ENFORCED THE BAN.  GIVEN THESE HEIGHTENED </p><p>SENSITIVITIES, EMBASSY CONTACT WITH THE MB FOCUSES ON </p><p>INFLUENTIAL MB MEMBERS WHO ARE ALSO ACTIVE IN THE </p><p>PROFESSIONAL SYNDICATES.  WE CALL ON THEM IN THEIR </p><p>CAPACITIES AS SYNDICATE LEADERS, NOT AS MEMBERS OF A </p><p>BANNED GROUP.  OUR CURRENT MB CONTACTS ARE MUHAMMAD </p><p>ABDEL QUDUS AND SALAH ABDEL MAQSUD (BOTH ON THE BOARD </p><p>OF THE JOURNALISTS SYNDICATE), AHMAD SEIF AL-ISLAM </p><p>HASAN AL-BANNA (FORMERLY SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE </p><p>LAWYERS SYNDICATE, AN ACTIVE LAWYER), AND ABUL ELA AL- </p><p>MADI (FOUNDER OF THE MB SPLINTER WASAT PARTY, FORMER </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE ENGINEERS SYNDICATE).   WE </p><p>ALSO CONTACT OTHER EGYPTIAN OBSERVERS OF THE MB SCENE. </p><p>THEY ARE DIA RASHWAN AND HALA MUSTAFA OF THE AL-AHRAM </p><p>CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, </p><p>MUHAMMAD SALAH OF AL-HAYAT NEWSPAPER, KHALED DAWOUD OF </p><p>AL-AHRAM NEWSPAPER, RIFAAT SAID, SECRETARY GENERAL OF </p><p>THE TAGAMMU\' PARTY, MAHMOUD ABAZA AND MUHAMMAD KAMIL OF </p><p>THE OPPOSITION WAFD PARTY, AND KAMAL ABUL MAGD, FORMER </p><p>MB MEMBER AND INTERNATIONAL LAWYER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KURTZER </p><p></p></div>
