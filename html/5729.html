<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 GUATEMALA 000403 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SNAR, PHUM, ECON, ETRD, MARR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: WHA/CEN DIRECTOR TRIVELLI DISCUSSES CAFTA, </p><p>COUNTER-DRUG COOPERATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS WITH GUATEMALANS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  During a two-day visit to Guatemala, WHA/CEN </p><p>Director Paul Trivelli discussed counter-narcotics </p><p>certification and free trade with Vice President Reyes and </p><p>the Acting Foreign Minister; CAFTA and fiscal responsibility </p><p>with the economic cabinet and business leaders; and support </p><p>for human rights programs with human rights leaders.  He </p><p>visited the site of an exhumation from the internal conflict </p><p>to show support for the work of threatened human rights </p><p>activists seeking to heal wounds left over from the  war. </p><p>GOG and private sector interlocutors were uniformly excited </p><p>about the prospects of a free trade agreement with the US, </p><p>and recognize that many non-trade related issues must be </p><p>addressed in order for CAFTA to be approved.  Human rights </p><p>leaders are refining their proposals for the creation of an </p><p>international commission to investigate the operations of </p><p>clandestine groups and welcomed our support.  Guatemalans </p><p>view 2003 as a pivotal year for the future of the country, as </p><p>elections and CAFTA negotiations will determine if Guatemala </p><p>will embrace the 21st century at the same pace as its </p><p>neighbors. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Vice President bullish on CAFTA </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador, visiting WHA/CEN Director Trivelli and </p><p>visiting AID Assistant Administrator Franco met with Vice </p><p>President Franciso Reyes on February 6 to discuss the full </p><p>range of bilateral issues.  The meeting was frank and </p><p>cordial.  AID/LAC Franco said the USG was pleased to see </p><p>Guatemala field a capable team of negotiators to the first </p><p>CAFTA meeting in Costa Rica, and said the U.S. views a free </p><p>trade agreement as the best hope for reducing poverty in the </p><p>region.  Franco noted that CAFTA would bring with it a deeper </p><p>relationship between our governments and societies, and said </p><p>that Congress would have to consider a range of non-trade </p><p>issues in the bilateral relationship as "background" to </p><p>ultimately approving CAFTA.  The Ambassador, Trivelli and </p><p>Franco all noted that corruption, counter-narcotics </p><p>cooperation, effective investigation of Amcit murders, and </p><p>human and labor rights performance were matters that would be </p><p>raised by critics of globalization who will question why the </p><p>United States is seeking a special relationship with </p><p>Guatemala at this time.  Vice President Reyes acknowledged </p><p>that these issues are ultimately inseparable from a free </p><p>trade relationship, calling them "links in the same chain," </p><p>and said the GOG has the political will to address them.  He </p><p>said that President Portillo has asked him to coordinate the </p><p>efforts of the different GOG entities that were participating </p><p>in the trade talks. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Vice President Reyes said that the GOG would like to </p><p>have CAFTA ready to sign by September, 2003 (note: two months </p><p>before national elections. end note).  He believes the </p><p>agreement with Chile could serve as a point of departure, but </p><p>said that Central America\'s unique situation would require </p><p>modifications.  He said that many in the private sector </p><p>oppose a free trade agreement because they believe it will </p><p>threaten their long-held monopolies.  AID/LAC Franco </p><p>responded that it is important that the government address </p><p>these concerns by consulting the private sector and civil </p><p>society throughout the negotiating process. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) WHA/CEN Trivelli told the Vice President that it is </p><p>critical that Guatemala\'s counter-narcotics cooperation </p><p>improve rapidly.  He also observed that continuing </p><p>decertification status for Guatemala would seriously </p><p>complicate finalization of a free trade agreement.  Trivelli </p><p>noted that there will be a formal review of Guatemala\'s </p><p>counter-narcotics performance in September, and it is crucial </p><p>that major advances take place before that.  Vice President </p><p>Reyes said that bi-weekly consultations had been set up </p><p>between the GOG and the Embassy to address our specific </p><p>concerns, and that the GOG would like to achieve </p><p>re-certification as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Trivelli also told the Vice President that the USG </p><p>applauded the Human Rights Ombudsman\'s recent call for the </p><p>creation of an international commission to investigate the </p><p>illegal activities of "clandestine groups," and that we hope </p><p>the GOG will support the proposal.  Vice President Reyes said </p><p>that President Portillo had already expressed his support for </p><p>this endeavor, but that he (Vice President Reyes) was </p><p>withholding judgment until he knew more about its goals. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador raised our request for GOG support for </p><p>Secretary Powell\'s February 5 UNSC statement on Iraq </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>(reported septel), and asked the Vice President to urge the </p><p>Ministers of Agriculture and Environment to resolve quickly a </p><p>dispute that has put a temporary halt to a joint </p><p>U.S.-Mexico-Guatemalan program to eradicate the Mediterranean </p><p>fruit fly.  The Vice President promised to get in touch with </p><p>the Ministers of Agriculture and Environment that day to see </p><p>how this problem, which could have serious consequences for </p><p>the eradication program in Guatemala, could be resolved </p><p>expeditiously. </p><p> </p><p>Foreign Ministry makes CAFTA priority </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador and WHA/CEN Director Trivelli met with </p><p>Acting Foreign Minister Rony Abiu at the MFA on February 6 to </p><p>discuss CAFTA, border talks with Belize and an Article 98 </p><p>agreement.  Vice Minister Abiu, who had only been appointed </p><p>two weeks previously and who handles the MFA\'s economic and </p><p>trade portfolios, said that the MFA has made securing a free </p><p>trade agreement with the U.S. its "highest priority."  He </p><p>said that the Ministry of Economy had the lead in the </p><p>negotiations, but that the MFA had responsibility for matters </p><p>involving regional integration.  In that vein, he said that </p><p>the MFA was tasked with managing the parallel talks with the </p><p>other Central American partners to establish a customs union </p><p>as a foundation for CAFTA.  The Ambassador and WHA/CEN </p><p>Trivelli noted that it would be crucial to address </p><p>counter-narcotics cooperation, threats against human rights </p><p>workers and the unresolved murders of Amcits before the CAFTA </p><p>process can be finalized.  Abiu acknowledged that "free trade </p><p>agreements have important underlying political components," </p><p>and said the GOG is determined to address those issues. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Trivelli raised USG disappointment at the failure of </p><p>Guatemala to embrace the recommendations of the facilitators </p><p>regarding the border demarcation with Belize, noting that it </p><p>is crucial at this juncture that both sides agree to </p><p>confidence and security building measures (CSBM\'s) that will </p><p>reduce border tensions.  Abiu said the GOG also placed a high </p><p>value on extending the CSBM\'s, and said the GOG was hopeful </p><p>that there would be an agreement with Belize which would </p><p>allow Foreign Minister Gutierrez to sign a CSBM\'s agreement </p><p>with Belize on February 8. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Trivelli closed the meeting by noting that the USG was </p><p>hopeful that Guatemala would sign an agreement with us </p><p>extending to U.S. military personnel in Guatemala protections </p><p>under Article 98 of the Treaty of Rome.  He noted that U.S. </p><p>military assistance to countries that had not signed these </p><p>agreements would be limited by law, making it difficult for </p><p>the U.S. to continue carrying out humanitarian exercises in </p><p>those countries that had not signed Article 98 agreements. </p><p>The Embassy sent a diplomatic note to the MFA in 2002 </p><p>proposing the signing of an agreement, but had not received a </p><p>response.  Abiu said he was unfamiliar with the matter, but </p><p>promised to look into it and get back to us soonest. </p><p> </p><p>Economic Cabinet:  CAFTA and fiscal discipline </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>10. (C) The Ambassador and WHA/CEN Trivelli met with Minister </p><p>of Finance Eduardo Weymann, Minister of Economy Patricia </p><p>Ramirez and chief GOG CAFTA negotiator Salomon Cohen on </p><p>February 7.  Cohen, just returned from the first CAFTA </p><p>negotiating session in San Jose, said that the first round of </p><p>free trade talks had gone well, and that all sides were </p><p>energized by the possibilities.  He said that the Chilean </p><p>agreement was a good starting point, but noted that Guatemala </p><p>would require "special attention" to issues not covered in </p><p>the Chilean agreement, including sugar, poultry and textiles. </p><p> On textiles, Cohen said that Guatemala is interested in </p><p>talking about "cotton-forward," a concept he said USG </p><p>negotiators had neither accepted nor discounted.  Cohen and </p><p>Ramirez both said Guatemala was concerned that the </p><p>negotiations would "start at zero," (applied MFN tariffs) not </p><p>taking into consideration that Guatemala already had </p><p>significant benefits under GSP and CBI.  They acknowledged </p><p>that market access talks with Chile had started with applied </p><p>tariff rates, but feared that Guatemala producers would find </p><p>it unacceptable that Guatemala would have to negotiate from a </p><p>base which did not take into consideration tariff concessions </p><p>they already have.  Negotiator Cohen said that for CAFTA to </p><p>work, it would be critical for the USG to provide significant </p><p>infrastructure assistance to Guatemala (he mentioned </p><p>irrigation specifically), noting that otherwise Guatemala was </p><p>unlikely to compete well in any free trade arrangement. </p><p>Trivelli noted that it is critical that the GOG bring the </p><p>private sector and civil society along by consulting </p><p>regularly with them, as their support will be crucial if </p><p>CAFTA is to work. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Finance Minister Weymann, overwhelmed by the ongoing </p><p>teachers\' protest demanding a 60% salary increase, said that </p><p>the GOG must impose fiscal discipline.  He said the IMF </p><p>agreement is the only lever he has to compel the cabinet to </p><p>exercise some discipline in spending in an election year.  He </p><p>acknowledged USG concerns over Guatemala\'s low rate of </p><p>taxation (just over 10 percent), and said that taxes will </p><p>have to be raised.  He said that even so he does not know how </p><p>the GOG will pay the 100 Quetzales (roughly $13) monthly </p><p>increase being offered teachers, and he fears it could create </p><p>unmanageable expectations from the rest of the public sector. </p><p> Weymann said that the government is floating eurobonds for </p><p>the purpose of financing a major reduction in the military, </p><p>providing counterpart funds for foreign aid projects, </p><p>providing support for victims of the internal conflict and </p><p>former civil patrol members, and armor-plating the Quetzal in </p><p>an election year.  The Ambassador expressed the international </p><p>community\'s concern that the proposed uses of the bond\'s </p><p>proceeds had not been clearly explained.  Weymann countered </p><p>that he and Central Bank President Sosa has stated clearly to </p><p>the press how the funds would be used.  He then mentioned </p><p>some of the changes that had been made to the original plan. </p><p>(Comment: In fact the FRG is trying to float the Eurobonds </p><p>for some projects of dubious economic benefit but with </p><p>potential political payoffs in an election year.) </p><p> </p><p>Business leaders optimistic despite confrontation with </p><p>government </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>12. (C) Following lunch with the Economic Cabinet, WHA/CEN </p><p>Trivelli met with representatives of Guatemala\'s private </p><p>sector -- Peter Lamport, Richard Aitkenhead and William </p><p>Stixrud, former Finance Ministers and/or Ambassadors to </p><p>Washington during the PAN administration of Alvaro Arzu.  All </p><p>agreed that the private sector strongly supports the </p><p>conclusion of a free trade agreement with the U.S.  While </p><p>they acknowledged that there was some concern over the lack </p><p>of dialogue with the GOG on CAFTA, they believe that </p><p>ultimately they will be consulted by Guatemala\'s new </p><p>negotiating team.  Lamport commented that some members of the </p><p>private sector are concerned about the fate of poultry and </p><p>sugar in the negotiations, and are not convinced that the </p><p>GOG, currently confronted with the private sector, will look </p><p>after their interests in these areas. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) The business leaders said that they would welcome </p><p>dialogue with the GOG, but said the Portillo Administration </p><p>had consistently shunned contact with them.  They said that </p><p>former Minister of Economy Arturo Montenegro lost his job for </p><p>trying to establish a dialogue with the private sector.  The </p><p>private sector leaders acknowledged the need for increased </p><p>tax collection, but said the government had reneged on its </p><p>promises made regarding the fiscal pact.  They do not believe </p><p>Portillo can be trusted to stick to any agreement they reach, </p><p>and have placed their hopes in the election of a new </p><p>government this fall.  The businessmen said that if the FRG </p><p>is re-elected this fall, it would be calamitous for </p><p>Guatemala, and investment would disappear. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) Guatemala\'s organized private sector views El </p><p>Salvador as a model for just about everything -- pragmatic </p><p>government, strong political parties (read ARENA), and a </p><p>private sector that is deeply involved in social development. </p><p> The private sector leaders said that they are in constant </p><p>contact with their Salvadoran counterparts for the purpose of </p><p>adapting their successes to Guatemala\'s situation.  Lamport </p><p>nevertheless agreed with Trivelli that the Salvadoran example </p><p>was not perfect, as ARENA lacked a credible counterweight on </p><p>the moderate left. </p><p> </p><p>Human Rights groups welcome USG support for commission </p><p>against clandestine groups </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) WHA/CEN Director Trivelli met with human rights </p><p>leaders Helen Mack, Mario Polanco, Claudia Samayoa, and </p><p>Orlando Blanco at the Myrna Mack Foundation on February 6. </p><p>After a brief press conference, Trivelli thanked the </p><p>activists for the meeting and reiterated our strong support </p><p>for advancing human rights in Guatemala and our specific </p><p>interest in the latest initiative to investigate the illegal </p><p>activities of clandestine groups.  Mack thanked him for the </p><p>overwhelming USG support and advice.  Polanco cautioned that </p><p>the human rights groups still needed more guidance to make </p><p>the commission effective.  Trivelli mentioned that the USG is </p><p>looking into ways to help technically support as well as fund </p><p>the international commission which will look into the </p><p>operations of clandestine groups and that we hope other </p><p>donors follow suit.  Trivelli also recommended that the human </p><p>rights groups finalize the details of their proposal before </p><p>entering into negotiations with the GOG.  Mack agreed and </p><p>said they hoped to formulate a proposal that was credible and </p><p>realistic. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) After discussion of the clandestine groups </p><p>proposal, Mack expressed concern over the new law regulating </p><p>NGO\'s which is currently being discussed in Congress.  The </p><p>human rights groups worry that this law will allow the </p><p>government to control the activities of NGO\'s at a time when </p><p>civil society has been in the forefront of opposition to the </p><p>Portillo Administration.  Trivelli recognized their concern </p><p>and said that we would review the law closely. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) In response to a question about the status of </p><p>threats against human rights workers, Samayoa responded that </p><p>the threats have been cyclical.  Some months there are </p><p>numerous new threats and others are relatively quiet. </p><p>Overall, she said threats were continuing and were a grave </p><p>concern to human rights activists. Trivelli and the DCM </p><p>responded that the USG views the protection of human rights </p><p>workers as one of our highest priorities in Guatemala and </p><p>that they should never hesitate to solicit our support in </p><p>specific cases of threats. </p><p> </p><p>Healing scars from the internal conflict in San Jose Poaquil </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) On February 7, WHA/CEN Director Trivelli, PolCouns, </p><p>HROff, and ConOff drove out to San Jose Poaquil, in the </p><p>remote mountainous region of Chimaltenango Department where </p><p>the Army and the guerrillas had turned the sparsely inhabited </p><p>river valleys into a no-mans land during the early 1980\'s. On </p><p>the banks of the Motagua River we observed an exhumation of </p><p>war victims\' remains performed by the Guatemalan Forensic </p><p>Anthropology Foundation (FAFG).  The remains were those of a </p><p>family, including small children, who had been murdered by </p><p>"armed, uniformed men" as the family tried to protect their </p><p>seed corn from pillaging.  The only survivors were small </p><p>children at the time, and they did not know if the </p><p>perpetrators had been military, PACs or guerrillas, all of </p><p>whom operated in the area.  FAFG director Fredy Peccerelli </p><p>described the process by which the sites are identified and </p><p>the legal process the FAFG must follow so that all of the </p><p>information collected during the exhumation can be preserved </p><p>for future legal cases.  Family members of the victims were </p><p>also present to observe the exhumation of their loved ones. </p><p>They were effusive in their thanks to the FAFG and the USG, </p><p>and said they had been waiting over 20 years to give their </p><p>slain relatives a proper burial. </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) Trivelli thanked the FAFG for all of their brave work </p><p>and asked Peccerelli what his personal motivation was to </p><p>soldier on with the exhumations (this was the FAFG\'s site </p><p>number 252) despite the multiple death threats and </p><p>intimidations he encounters.  Peccerelli responded that while </p><p>in the long term the information the FAFG collects may be </p><p>used to put war criminals behind bars, he said his motivation </p><p>is the thousands of family members they have helped heal.  He </p><p>said, "the wounds left by the internal conflict run deep and </p><p>the people of Guatemala have suffered.  If I can help my </p><p>country heal, one exhumation at a time, then I feel like I am </p><p>helping to make a difference." </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>20. (C) WHA/CEN Trivelli\'s visit came at a time of growing </p><p>internal political confrontation, revolving around the </p><p>upcoming election, and increasing hope of economic </p><p>opportunities generated by a free trade agreement with the </p><p>U.S.  All sides view 2003 as a pivotal year for Guatemala, </p><p>and acknowledged that Guatemala will have to successfully </p><p>address long festering problems of human and labor rights, </p><p>counter-narcotics cooperation, the murders of Amcits, </p><p>official corruption and political confrontation if it is to </p><p>join its Central American neighbors in reaching a new trade </p><p>relationship with the United States.  Guatemalans are </p><p>optimistic that they meet this challenge. </p><p> </p><p>21. (U) This cable was cleared by WHA/CEN Director Paul </p><p>Trivelli. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
