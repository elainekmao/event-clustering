BELGRADE 810 </p><p> </p><p>     B. THE HAGUE 209 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Legal Counselor Clifton M. Johnson per 1.5 (b) and (d) a </p><p>nd 1.6. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The last two months have dealt blows to </p><p>Slobodan Milosevic from </p><p>Belgrade and within the trial chamber of the International </p><p>Criminal Tribunal </p><p>for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).  In the ICTY, a series of </p><p>witnesses have hammered Milosevic with crime-based details of </p><p>the joint criminal enterprise of which Milosevic is alleged </p><p>to be the head.  As in the past, such challenges have been </p><p>coupled with a decline in Milosevic\'s health, whether </p><p>genuinely brought on by the tensions of the trial, </p><p>manipulated for tactical reasons to prompt a trial delay, or </p><p>a combination of the two.  Meanwhile, the series of actions </p><p>taken by the Government of Serbia and Montenegro (GOSAM) to </p><p>round up those connected to the criminal gangs associated </p><p>with the assassination of Zoran Djindjic has damaged his </p><p>support network and further increased the pressure on him. In </p><p>discussions with well-placed officials in the Registry and </p><p>the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) and based on their </p><p>observations of him at trial, Embassy legal officers have </p><p>gathered a mixed picture of Milosevic\'s physical and mental </p><p>health. End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Embassy Belgrade has reported extensively on the law </p><p>enforcement actions taken by the GOSAM since the March </p><p>assassination of Zoran Djindjic, which in the process has </p><p>netted much of Milosevic\'s former colleagues in running the </p><p>former Yugoslavia (ref a, among others). Much of the round-up </p><p>has hit Milosevic directly.  Close observers of the trial, </p><p>including those within OTP and the Registry, have long </p><p>believed that Markovic has given general direction to the </p><p>accused\'s defense efforts and led the political efforts on </p><p>his behalf, supported by Simatovic, Stanisic and a bevy of </p><p>Serb lawyers and bureaucratic (security, military, police) </p><p>holdovers from the Milosevic regime.  A Registry official has </p><p>seen evidence that the support such persons provided is now </p><p>drying up, leaving Milosevic increasingly isolated in his </p><p>prison cell. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In the weeks following the ICTY\'s spring recess (April </p><p>21 - 25), lead prosecutor </p><p>Geoffrey Nice (protect), who sees Milosevic in the courtroom </p><p>regularly, did not detect </p><p>noticeable changes in his physical appearance or his ability </p><p>to concentrate on the proceedings or conduct </p><p>cross-examination.  However, Registry senior legal officer </p><p>Christian Rohde (protect), who sees Milosevic on a weekly </p><p>basis outside the courtroom and monitors his health closely, </p><p>gave a markedly different take.  He told embassy legal </p><p>officers that </p><p>Milosevic had lost "a couple of kilos" in the past few weeks </p><p>alone.  Rohde said </p><p>that those who see him outside of the proceedings believe </p><p>that his defense is </p><p>"totally weakening" and that it appears that he has lost </p><p>access to his sources </p><p>of intelligence and finances, something, Rohde averred, that </p><p>is showing in his </p><p>diminished level of trail preparation.  The Registry has </p><p>Milosevic\'s blood pressure under </p><p>control at this time, but that is only because he is taking </p><p>his medication as </p><p>prescribed.  If Milosevic goes off his medication, as he has </p><p>done before, the health problems that have disrupted the </p><p>trial in the past could come to the fore once again.  On May </p><p>27, Milosevic came down with a high fever, causing the trial </p><p>chamber to adjourn the trial for two days.  However, the </p><p>trial resumed on May 29. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Senior trial attorney Dermot Groome (protect) </p><p>concurred with Nice\'s view that, if the accused is suffering </p><p>physically, his appearance does not reflect it in any </p><p>worrying way.  Embassy legal officers, who see Milosevic far </p><p>less often than the prosecutors or Registry officials, noted </p><p>that while Milosevic looked a bit gaunt during some </p><p>proceedings in May, he did not look ill.  Yet during the week </p><p>of May 13, Groome told an embassy legal officer that, while </p><p>he did not detect serious physical problems with Milosevic </p><p>aside from some gauntness, he did notice a few changes in his </p><p>preparation and courtroom behavior.  (Note: Groome cautioned </p><p>that these were initial impressions and could not be taken to </p><p>reflect any kind of medical or psychological evaluation.) </p><p>Groome said that on May 8, the accused showed signs of </p><p>"disconnected thought processes" in his cross-examination, an </p><p>area in which Milosevic was usually strong.  His questions on </p><p>cross were disjointed and did not seem to attend toward any </p><p>particular goal.  Groome found particularly disturbing an </p><p>event in May 9, when, at the conclusion of his cross </p><p>examination, Milosevic stood around with the amici curiae </p><p>(the "friends of the court" assisting the defense but not </p><p>defending him per se) and "giggled and engaged in silly" </p><p>conversation -- something he\'d never seen Milosevic do in </p><p>over one year of trial proceedings.  It could be fatigue, </p><p>Groome suggested, but in a worst-case scenario, it could also </p><p>spell the beginning of some kind of physical or mental </p><p>exhaustion.  If the latter, Groome worried that the chamber </p><p>could be put in an even trickier bind than it is currently </p><p>(i.e., where it must monitor the accused\'s blood pressure) </p><p>because it would need to monitor his ability or competency to </p><p>defend himself.  Moreover, with a series of insider witnesses </p><p>appearing in the coming weeks, Groome is worried about the </p><p>possible cumulative effect of evidence and outside pressures </p><p>on Milosevic\'s health. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Meanwhile, an outburst by Milosevic during the </p><p>presentation of "crime-base" evidence by the prosecution over </p><p>the past few weeks resulted in a significant admission that </p><p>the prosecution intends to exploit.  Protected witness </p><p>B-1461, a farmer from outside Zvornik, testified to the </p><p>brutality of a Bosnian Serb paramilitary group under Dusan </p><p>Vuckovic.  During cross-examination, Milosevic asserted that </p><p>"I and the authorities of Serbia" punished Vuckovic as a war </p><p>criminal for his actions.  While Milosevic may have thought </p><p>that he was distancing himself from the crimes described, the </p><p>outburst also provide an admission of a degree of </p><p>disciplinary authority that he exercised over Bosnian Serb </p><p>paramilitaries -- contrary to his normal insistence that </p><p>Belgrade had nothing to do with the paramilitaries. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) On May 20, the trial chamber granted the prosecution\'s </p><p>request for an additional 100 trial days beginning May 16 for </p><p>it to complete its case.  Milosevic did not object to the </p><p>request reportedly stating to the judges, "Time has been the </p><p>only consideration in what you call a trial."  The trial </p><p>chamber concluded that circumstances exist to vary the </p><p>original order calling for the prosecution to finish its case </p><p>by May 16, and that it is in the interests of justice to </p><p>allow the prosecution to call as many witnesses as possible </p><p>relating to its core case.  (There have been more than 50 </p><p>days lost due to Milosevic\'s ill health since the trial </p><p>began.)  The extension  means that the trial will most likely </p><p>continue into 2005.  The trial chamber noted that without a </p><p>final prosecution witness list, it is difficult for the </p><p>accused to adequately prepare his defense.  The prosecution </p><p>stated that they would finalize the witness list shortly. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment: Milosevic is entering the final stage of the </p><p>trial against him in a significantly weaker  position than he </p><p>was just a few months ago.  To outside observers, the </p><p>prosecution seems to have hit its stride, with credible </p><p>witnesses testifying to terrible crimes committed by those </p><p>who were affiliated with Milosevic or his supporters. </p><p>Milosevic seems to lack the resources to intimidate and </p><p>rattle witnesses as he has done in the past.  Meanwhile, his </p><p>support network is dissipating -- it is unlikely that he has </p><p>spoken to the person closest to him, his wife, since early </p><p>April, when she was targeted for arrest by Belgrade law </p><p>enforcement authorities.  The big question facing the </p><p>prosecutors and the bench at this stage is whether the flood </p><p>of bad news will eventually overwhelm Milosevic\'s physical </p><p>and/or mental health.  Milosevic, though diminished, is not </p><p>near that stage now but the coming weeks should make clearer </p><p>whether the recent downturn in his health was a another in a </p><p>series of temporary fluctuations or the beginning of a more </p><p>sustained decline.  End comment. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
