<p>UNCLAS JOHANNESBURG 00264 </p><p> </p><p>CAPE TOWN ALSO FOR EMBASSY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINS, SF </p><p>SUBJECT:  THOUSANDS IN JOHANNESBURG PEACEFULLY </p><p>CELEBRATE MANDELA RELEASE </p><p> </p><p>1.  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HAPPY REVELERS HAVE FILLED </p><p>THE STREETS OF JOHANNESBURG AND SURROUNDING </p><p>TOWNSHIPS SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF NELSON MANDELA\'S </p><p>RELEASE WAS MADE ON SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 10.  CROWDS </p><p>OF SEVERAL HUNDRED GATHERED IN SPONTANEOUS </p><p>CELEBRATIONS IN THE CITY CENTER ON SATURDAY AND </p><p>SUNDAY, MANY OF THEM MARCHING TO THE NEARBY "GRAY" </p><p>ENTERTAINMENT AREA OF HILLBROW, WHERE A THRONG OF </p><p>MORE THAN 5,000 FILLED THE STREETS BOTH DAYS. </p><p>POLICE MAINTAINED A LOW PROFILE, OFFERING PROTECTIVE </p><p>ASSISTANCE RATHER THAN DISRUPTING THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS.  THE MOOD HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY </p><p>ONE OF JOY, WITH FEW REPORTS OF PROBLEMS AND NONE OF </p><p>THE LOOTING REPORTED IN CAPE TOWN. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN SOWETO THE CROWDS HAVE BEEN MUCH BIGGER BUT </p><p>THE MOOD THE SAME.  THE STREETS ARE FILLED WITH </p><p>HAPPY CELEBRATORS, AND THE SCHOOLS ARE EMPTY AS </p><p>STUDENTS JOIN THE FESTIVITIES.  A LARGE CROWD </p><p>GATHERED AT JABULANI AMPHITHEATER TO CELEBRATE ON </p><p>SUNDAY, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS FILLED RICKETY ORLANDO </p><p>STADIUM -- FAR EXCEEDING ITS CAPACITY -- ON MONDAY </p><p>TO AWAIT THE EXPECTED ARRIVAL OF MANDELA.  (THE </p><p>CROWD WAS DISAPPOINTED, HOWEVER, AS HIS RETURN TO </p><p>SOWETO HAS BEEN DELAYED UNTIL TUESDAY.)  A HUGE </p><p>CROWD CONTINUES TO WAIT OUTSIDE THE MANDELA HOME IN </p><p>ORLANDO WEST, AND THOUSANDS OF OTEHRS ARE SCATTERED </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE TOWNSHIP IN PRIVATE CELEBRATION. </p><p>POLICE PRESENCE IN NEGLIGIBLE, WITH "YOUNG COMRADES" </p><p>TAKING OVER TRAFFIC DIRECTION RESPONSIBILITIES (WITH </p><p>VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS).  SINGING, DANCING, </p><p>HUGGING, CHANTING AND CLENCHED FIST SALUTES ARE THE </p><p>ORDER OF THE DAY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE SCENE HAS BEEN SIMILAR IN OTHER TOWNSHIPS IN </p><p>THE GREATER JOHANNESBURG AREA, WHERE HOMES HAVE BEEN </p><p>EMPTIED AS THOUSANDS HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS.  THE </p><p>MOOD HAS BEEN GENERALLY FRIENDLY, BUT A NUMBER OF </p><p>INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE HAVE BEEN REPORTED.  THE </p><p>CELEBRATIONS HAVE BEEN MARRED IN SOWETO BY DRUNKEN </p><p>YOUTHS TRYING TO HIJACK CARS, APPROPRIATE FUEL FROM </p><p>FILLING STATIONS, AND HARASS MOTORISTS.  AT LEAST </p><p>ONE GRENADE ATTACK, AGAINST A CITY COUNCILLOR\'S </p><p>HOUSE, HAS BEEN REPORTED.  BLOODSHED OCCURRED OVER </p><p>THE WEEKEND ON THE VOLATILE EAST RAND, AS FIVE WERE </p><p>KILLED IN CONFRONTATIONS WITH POLICE IN KATLEHONG. </p><p>FARTHER AFIELD, TWO DEATHS ALSO OCCURRED IN WELKOM, </p><p>AS A POLICE VAN PLOWED INTO A CROWD OF CELEBRATORS, </p><p>SENDING MORE THAN 20 OTHERS TO THE HOSPITAL.  BY AND </p><p>LARGE, HOWEVER, THE POPULAR RESPONSE HAS BEEN </p><p>OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE.  GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE </p><p>CROWDS AND THE UNIMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE </p><p>NATIONAL RECEPTION COMMITTEE THUS FAR, NEGATIVE </p><p>INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN MUCH FEWER THAN WE MIGHT HAVE </p><p>EXPECTED.  IT IS LIKELY, IN FACT, THAT SOWETO\'S </p><p>NORMALLY HIGH RATE OF WEEKEND CRIME DROPPED </p><p>PRECIPITOUSLY THIS PARTICULAR WEEKEND. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WHILE MOST OF THE CELEBRATORS ARE BLACK, WE HAVE </p><p>SEEN VIRTUALLY NO EVIDENCE OF HOSTILITY TOWARDS </p><p>WHITES.  SIMILARLY, WE HAVE HEARD OF NO INCIDENTS OF </p><p>RIGHT-WING WHITE ATTACKS AGAINST BLACKS.  POLICE ARE </p><p>LAYING LOW, PERMITTING THE CELEBRATIONS TO TAKE </p><p>THEIR COURSE.  THE CELEBRATORS, EVEN THOUGH THEIR </p><p>ACTIONS HAVE BEEN LARGELY SPONTANEOUS, ARE </p><p>MAINTAINING CONTROL TO A LARGE EXTENT.  IT HAS BEEN </p><p>AN IMPRESSIVE DISPLAY OF TOLERANCE AND HARMONY THUS </p><p>FAR, BUT THE REAL TEST WILL OCCUR WHEN MANDELA </p><p>HIMSELF ARRIVES IN SOWETO LATER TODAY (FEBRUARY </p><p>13).  HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WILL BE WAITING FOR HIM, </p><p>AND THE SHEER CRUSH OF HUMANITY WILL BE DIFFICULT TO </p><p>CONTAIN. </p><p> </p><p>CHAVEAS </p><p></p></div>
