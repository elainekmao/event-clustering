O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, EFIN, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ExxonMobil tells GOZ to cut fuel subsidy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  A visiting ExxonMobil delegation </p><p>recently urged the GOZ to stop subsidizing fuel </p><p>consumption, which has completely overburdened the </p><p>country\'s foreign exchange assets.  The delegation </p><p>suggested a more targeted support mechanism for public </p><p>transport and critical services that would soften the </p><p>blow of a 5-6 fold increase in the fuel price.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ExxonMobil Africa and Middle East Marketing </p><p>Director John Bell led a group of company executives to </p><p>Zimbabwe in the week of Jan. 13 for talks with the GOZ. </p><p>A steep slide in the Zimdollar has meant the GOZ now </p><p>subsidizes more than 90 percent of the cost of commercial </p><p>and retail fuel (about US$ 1 million/day), a burden it </p><p>can no longer meet.  The country has suffered severe </p><p>shortages over the past 5 weeks.  Mobil is one of 5 </p><p>foreign oil companies that share the distribution </p><p>business with 17 local operators. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In a Jan. 15 meeting with Finance Minister </p><p>Herbert Murerwa, the ExxonMobil team argued that the </p><p>parastatal National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM) </p><p>should stop subsidizing the fuel it imports, which would </p><p>trigger a 5-6 fold rise in the pump price.  Multinational </p><p>and other oil companies would pay the Zimdollar parallel </p><p>rate equivalent to NOCZIM and charge a slightly higher </p><p>amount at the pump.  (The Confederation of Zimbabwe </p><p>Industries had earlier backed away from a proposal for a </p><p>two-tier fuel-pricing scheme over fear of leakages.) </p><p>Instead, the GOZ could underwrite part of the cost of </p><p>public transport and other services.  Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>artificially low fuel price -- about US$ .20/gallon -- </p><p>promotes waste, profiteering and overconsumption. </p><p>Frustratingly, Murerwa was noncommittal in the absence of </p><p>agreement from President Mugabe. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) While ExxonMobil\'s arguments make sense, the GOZ </p><p>is concerned with broader implications.  Such a dramatic </p><p>rise in the fuel price would be unpopular and fan the </p><p>country\'s high inflation rate, already 198 percent </p><p>officially and 300-400 percent unofficially.  It would </p><p>lock in fuel at an exchange rate of around Z$ 1,500/US$ </p><p>1, a market devaluation the GOZ refuses to recognize. </p><p>And it would make mincemeat of the GOZ\'s extensive price </p><p>controls, the main tenant of its "macroeconomic policy." </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
