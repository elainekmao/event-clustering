<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000278 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL - J. MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ELECTORAL COMMISSION CONTINUES TO FACE </p><p>LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reason 1.5(b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: During a January 12 conversation with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, Independent National Electoral Commission </p><p>(INEC) Chairman Abel Guobadia said INEC would hold </p><p>elections as scheduled provided the FY 03 budget allocation </p><p>was received in time.  Guobadia continued to blame current </p><p>logistical bottlenecks in electoral preparations on belated </p><p>FY 02 funding and on the December Supreme Court decision </p><p>that allowed the registration of over 20 new parties.  On </p><p>voter registration, Guobadia said verification of the </p><p>voters rolls was almost finished but admitted a high rate </p><p>of fraud.  Regarding the January 21-24 make-up </p><p>registration, the INEC Chairman explained the exercise </p><p>would be conducted at the 774 local government headquarters </p><p>throughout the country vice the 120,000 sites used for the </p><p>original round last September.  He predicted INEC would be </p><p>maligned for reducing the sites, but argued INEC could do </p><p>no better given its financial constraints.  USAID Country </p><p>Director Liberi, USAID Democracy & Governance Officer </p><p>Wright and PolCouns accompanied the Ambassador.  Chairman </p><p>Guobadia was joined by INEC Secretary Hakeem Baba-Ahmed. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Beginning the meeting, Chairman Guobadia thanked </p><p>Ambassador Jeter for pressing the National Assembly and the </p><p>Presidency to fund INEC during the final quarter of 2002. </p><p>INEC probably "would not have gotten the amount it did at </p><p>the time it did" but for the purposeful intervention of the </p><p>Ambassador and other Western Chiefs of Missions, Guobadia </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Attempting to preempt some of our questions, </p><p>Guobadia asserted the electoral schedule was tossed off </p><p>kilter when "the political environment shifted" after the </p><p>Supreme Court decision last December opened the door to the </p><p>registration of over 20 additional parties.  Guobadia </p><p>contended INEC was not the culprit when it refused to </p><p>register those parties in mid-2002.  He characterized INEC </p><p>as merely and faithfully following the electoral law as it </p><p>existed.  INEC\'s registration guidelines were based on the </p><p>electoral law, which effectively "raised the bar" against </p><p>these parties, he argued.  When the Supreme Court </p><p>invalidated the sections of the law dealing with party </p><p>registration, INEC\'s corollary regulations also were </p><p>nullified.  INEC then developed less stringent regulations </p><p>consonant with the Court\'s ruling; these new regulations </p><p>paved the way for the additional parties. (Comment: </p><p>Guobadia seemed to be at pains to defend his actions and to </p><p>show us that he was not the killjoy of greater political </p><p>participation as he had been portrayed in the media.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The electoral timetable had to be amended to </p><p>accommodate the newcomers, Guobadia continued.  Before the </p><p>ruling, INEC had proposed that parties submit their notices </p><p>of interest for each election in which they would </p><p>participate at least 120 days before the elections; the </p><p>names of the actual candidates would be required 90 days </p><p>before the contests.  After the Supreme Court decision, the </p><p>National Assembly reduced the 120 days for the party </p><p>deadline to 90 days, not realizing the confusion it would </p><p>create due to the pre-existing 90-day limit on candidate </p><p>submissions.  Finally, the National Assembly reduced the </p><p>period for candidate submissions to 60 days to resolve this </p><p>problem. After pointing to this flaw in the electoral law, </p><p>Guobadia asserted there were still many others that needed </p><p>rectification before the actual election took place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Voters Registration </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Both Guobadia and Baba-Ahmed acknowledged voter </p><p>registration was key to a credible election and both tried </p><p>to defend INEC\'s handling of the registration exercise. </p><p>The Chairman stated that over 60 million of the 72 million </p><p>forms prepared for the September exercise were returned for </p><p>processing.  He claimed the scanning of the forms into the </p><p>new computer system was nearly completed.  (Scanning was </p><p>required not only to input information into a central </p><p>database, but to prevent multiple registrations through the </p><p>scanning and checking of registrants\' thumbprints as well </p><p>as their biographic information.)  Guobadia admitted a high </p><p>rate of fraudulent registrations.  Although declining to </p><p>give a nationwide figure, he identified a community in </p><p>Ekiti State where 1,000 of 4,000 forms were tossed out. </p><p>Noting the Ekiti community was rural, Guobadia feared the </p><p>incidence in Nigeria\'s cities likely would be worse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Registration "Lite" </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) While still cleaning the rolls from last September\'s </p><p>registration, INEC would also conduct a January 21-24 </p><p>"make-up" exercise, Secretary Baba-Ahmed revealed. </p><p>Implying that INEC thought a second round unnecessary, </p><p>Baba-Ahmed stated the decision on a second round was a </p><p>political one. It was in response to the perception widely </p><p>held by Nigerians and the international community that many </p><p>eligible voters were unable to register last September. </p><p>Since INEC never budgeted for a second registration, it had </p><p>to shift funds from "other" priorities to finance this </p><p>unexpected expense. To accomplish this second round without </p><p>siphoning too much from other essential tasks, INEC would </p><p>limit registration to the 774 local government authorities. </p><p>It would not reopen the 120,000 locations used in </p><p>September. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Baba-Ahmed downplayed the hardship to potential </p><p>registrants this reduction would cause.  He contended that </p><p>the problem of under-registration was mainly urban. Because </p><p>under-registration was infrequent in rural areas, the </p><p>reduction of the number of locations would not compel large </p><p>numbers of rural residents to travel long distances to </p><p>register. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Additionally, to lessen fraudulent registrations </p><p>during the second round, INEC would make all new </p><p>registrants formally disclaim they had not previously </p><p>registered and acknowledge that dual registration was a </p><p>punishable crime.  Due to the reduction of sites, Baba- </p><p>Ahmed predicted that many Nigerians would traduce INEC and </p><p>make-up exercise. (Comment: Ahmed\'s prediction was </p><p>partially correct. Tight finances might have compelled INEC </p><p>to fashion "registration lite." However, most people </p><p>believe INEC only begrudgingly agreed to a second round; </p><p>they did not expect INEC to exert maximum effort for the </p><p>make-up.  Because both expectations and turnouts were low, </p><p>the criticism has not been as vocal as Baba-Ahmed feared. </p><p>More on the second round of registration will be reported </p><p>septel.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The Chairman predicted the registration lists would </p><p>be published by late February or early March, followed by a </p><p>5-day period of claims and objections. The INEC officials </p><p>admitted they have not resolved exactly how they would </p><p>handle the claims process.  They will have to post the </p><p>locally relevant information at each of the 120,000 sites </p><p>used in September, with a maximum of 500 names posted at </p><p>any one location.  Because of fear of tampering, the list </p><p>could not simply be posted and left unattended in a public </p><p>place overnight. Precautions would have to be established </p><p>so that citizens could check the lists without leaving the </p><p>lists vulnerable to tampering and fraud, the INEC officials </p><p>conceded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>WHERE IS THE MONEY? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Responding to a question from the Ambassador, </p><p>Guobadia sAID that news reports of INEC requesting an </p><p>additional 28 billion Naira were essentially correct.  He </p><p>explained the 28 billion received in December was INEC\'s </p><p>FY-02 allocation. The FY-02 allocation was essentially to </p><p>fund pre-election day requirements, such as ballot boxes, </p><p>ballot papers, etc. The FY-03 allocation, in addition to </p><p>paying recurrent expenses and for a new office building, </p><p>was needed for actual election-day expenses. </p><p>(Transportation costs for INEC workers, allowances, some </p><p>communications, tabulation forms, etc.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Secretary Baba-Ahmed emphasized that INEC needed </p><p>international financial assistance in two major areas: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Transportation of ballot papers and sensitive equipment </p><p>to the polls. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Election results management in order to ensure quick and </p><p>accurate transmission of results from local stations to the </p><p>next successive stage of vote tabulation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On the first point, INEC wanted donor assistance to develop </p><p>a transportation system to move ballot papers and INEC </p><p>officials to the 120,000 polling locations just before the </p><p>voting begins.  Orchestrating so many movements within a </p><p>brief time would be a complex logistical undertaking </p><p>requiring reliable transportation assets, Baba-Ahmed </p><p>argued. INEC had considered pre-positioning materials well </p><p>in advance; but, apprehension about theft and fraud doomed </p><p>this possibility. On the second point, INEC needed  to </p><p>quickly tabulate and transmit results, particularly from </p><p>isolated rural communities.  Baba-Ahmed claimed </p><p>irregularities and delays with the vote tabulation were </p><p>among the most frequent complaints about the 1999 election. </p><p>INEC wanted to avoid these complaints this time around. </p><p>The USAID Director responded that USAID, along with other </p><p>donors, would be willing to consider reasonable requests to </p><p>help on both fronts.  However, she disabused the INEC </p><p>officials of any notion that USAID would fund the purchase </p><p>of big-ticket items such as helicopters and vehicles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>GRADUAL PROGRESS ON LOGISTICS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Guobadia was pleased INEC had received required </p><p>funding for pre-election day expenses; however, the advent </p><p>of the new parties had complicated planning.  For instance, </p><p>preparation of ballot paper had been made exponentially </p><p>more complex.  INEC did not know whether to place all the </p><p>parties on the ballot for all elections even though most </p><p>parties would not field a complete slate of candidates. </p><p>Because of the uncertainty over which parties will compete </p><p>in what elections, INEC planned to wait until the February </p><p>11 deadline for the parties to submit their lists of </p><p>candidates before developing the ballot paper.  He </p><p>acknowledged the decision on the ballot paper could be </p><p>further delayed if they decided to use pictures and names </p><p>of the actual candidates since the parties had until March </p><p>11 to amend their candidate lists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Ambassador Jeter emphasized that the ballot paper </p><p>and boxes were essential; INEC had to ensure the ordering </p><p>was done in good time; the Ambassador expressed concern </p><p>that waiting until late February or March might be cutting </p><p>things too tightly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>ELECTION SCHEDULE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Despite the tight scheduling, the Chairman was </p><p>confident that INEC would be on schedule for the April 12 </p><p>National Assembly elections and April 19 Presidential and </p><p>gubernatorial elections.  Runoffs, if needed, would be </p><p>April 29. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Guobadia mentioned the January 6 Diplomatic Note </p><p>sent by the MFA to most diplomatic missions outlining the </p><p>accreditation process for international monitors.  He </p><p>explained that INEC would conduct the actual accreditation </p><p>but MFA would be the initial point-of-contact for </p><p>prospective monitors.  The Chairman hoped the UNDP would </p><p>coordinate the work of the international groups since INEC </p><p>did not have the wherewithal to manage the task. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>CODE(S)OF CONDUCT </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Baba-Ahmed stated the political party Code of Conduct </p><p>probably would have been finalized in December but for the </p><p>advent of the new parties.  He added that INEC Commissioner </p><p>Musa was talking with all the political parties and hoped </p><p>to finalize the Code in a few weeks.  In response to </p><p>Ambassador Jeter\'s recommendation for a journalists\' code </p><p>of conduct, the Chairman stated that the Ministry of </p><p>Communication would have to take the lead, but took it upon </p><p>himself to discuss the idea with the Minister. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C)  Although neither the most engaging or forthcoming </p><p>of interlocutors, the Chairman has been increasingly more </p><p>accessible and open during our discussions.  With the </p><p>political party conventions now past, the electoral season </p><p>is in full swing; Guobadia knows that he and his Commission </p><p>will be at the center of attention; moreover, he knows the </p><p>heat that will be generated by his occupancy of that </p><p>central position.  The countdown to April is inexorable. </p><p>While INEC\'s performance has improved incrementally during </p><p>the past weeks, it will have to accelerate its step in </p><p>order to be ready in time. We are concerned by INEC\'s lack </p><p>of stride on key items like ballot boxes and papers.  The </p><p>schedule is tight and the margin for error is wafer thin. </p><p>We will continue to press INEC to move both more smartly </p><p>and faster on these and other key issues. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
