<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001192 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AF/W FOR BOOTH, FRENCH </p><p>AF/RAS FOR ENGLE, BITTRICK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MARR, XY, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: ECOWAS: POSITIVE REACTIONS TO WASP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1185 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA ANDREWS; Reason 1.5 (b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) During April 12 discussions on plans for future peace </p><p>support programs for Africa (reftel), AF/RAS Greg Engle </p><p>briefed ECOWAS Deputy Executive Secretary Chiekh Diarra and </p><p>his staff on the West African Stabilization Program (WASP). </p><p>Diarra\'s office at the Secretariat now includes Military </p><p>Program Officer Colonel Dixon Dikio, Director for Child </p><p>Protection Programs Ibrahim Diouf, Operations Center Director </p><p>Florence Iheme, and Political Affairs Advisor Frank </p><p>Afanyiarossou.  Diarra said he would finish hiring six </p><p>additional senior directors by the end of May, and planned to </p><p>have other professional staff hired shortly thereafter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Engle briefed on the ECOWAS/GOSL logistics training </p><p>depot (to be located in Freetown), the EUCOM-led C3 </p><p>assistance for the ECOWAS Operations Center (based in the </p><p>Secretariat), the possibility of a regional NCO training </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>center initiative and other bilateral assistance that could </p><p>have positive impact both for sub-regional bilateral partners </p><p>as well as ECOWAS (including MTTs).  Diarra responded very </p><p>positively to the plans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Diarra and Dikio expressed concerns regarding the </p><p>placement of the depot in Freetown.  While accepting that the </p><p>USG was responding to a window of opportunity (since the </p><p>equipment is already in Freetown), they wondered about </p><p>possible support for the ECOWAS equipment based presently in </p><p>Lagos, and the impact of possible instability in Sierra </p><p>Leone.  Dikio also noted that it was extremely important that </p><p>the transfer of ownership of the depot and equipment be made </p><p>extremely clear through written agreement among the parties, </p><p>to prevent any disagreements between the USG, ECOWAS and the </p><p>GOSL as to the ownership of the equipment and facilities. </p><p>The visiting team and ECOWAS officials were satisfied that </p><p>these issues could be resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Diarra said he would raise the WASP plans at the next </p><p>meeting of the ECOWAS Defense and Security Committee (ECOWAS </p><p>Chiefs of Defense Staff) in May, to build the necessary </p><p>member-state understanding and support for the program.  He </p><p>noted that this meeting would also consider a training policy </p><p>for the ECOWAS peacekeeping stand-by units. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: Dikio\'s concern regarding ownership is </p><p>understandable.  We will need to make these modalities very </p><p>clear, or an excellent program of support could quickly turn </p><p>into a disagreement between the organization and one of its </p><p>member-states.  The Secretariat will likely need to present </p><p>the logistical depot plan and other WASP items to the </p><p>member-states on a political level to ensure the needed </p><p>acceptance and support for these programs.  However, an </p><p>important first step -- obtaining the ECOWAS Secretariat\'s </p><p>buy-in -- has been accomplished.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
