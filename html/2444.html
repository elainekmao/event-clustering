(U)  SUMMARY:  POPE JOHN PAUL II LED AN INTERFAITH APPEAL </p><p>FOR PEACE JANUARY 24 IN ASSISI, ITALY AT WHICH HE ISSUED A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00521  01 OF 03  040621Z </p><p>RINGING CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE PERPETRATED IN THE NAME OF </p><p>RELIGION. MORE THAN 300 RELIGIOUS LEADERS ATTENDED FROM </p><p>AROUND THE WORLD TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE PAPAL CALL FOR </p><p>DIALOG AMONG RELIGIONS AND CULTURES.  THE MEETING, WHICH THE </p><p>POPE CALLED IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE WORLD SITUATION </p><p>POST-SEPTEMBER, INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF WESTERN AND </p><p>NON-WESTERN RELIGIONS.  VATICAN-WATCHERS HIGHLIGHTED THE </p><p>STRONG ORTHODOX PRESENCE. KEY MUSLIM PARTICIPANTS NUMBERED </p><p>OVER THIRTY, INCLUDING A THEOLOGIAN FROM MECCA WHO SPOKE AT </p><p>LENGTH WITH POLOFF.  THE ASSISI MEETING REPRESENTED THE </p><p>CULMINATION OF RECENT VATICAN EFFORTS TO COMBAT PERCEPTIONS </p><p>OF A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE JANUARY 24 ASSISI "DAY OF PRAYER FOR PEACE IN THE </p><p>WORLD" WAS THE OCCASION FOR UNUSUAL ENCOUNTERS AND UNLIKELY </p><p>DIALOGUE. SHARING CENTER STAGE WERE ZOROASTRIAN AND CATHOLIC, </p><p>ANIMIST AND MUSLIM, BUDDHIST AND BAPTIST, JAINIST AND QUAKER, </p><p>HINDU AND ORTHODOX, AND MANY OTHERS FROM SCORES OF </p><p>DISTINCTIVE FAITH TRADITIONS.  AN ATTEMPT TO BRIDGE RELIGIOUS </p><p>DIFFERENCES IN AN AFFIRMATION OF COMMON VALUES, THE ASSISI </p><p>MEETING REPRESENTED AN ECUMENICAL AND INTERFAITH CAPSTONE FOR </p><p>THE JOHN PAUL II PAPACY.  THE POPE\'S OWN CONDEMNATION OF WAR, </p><p>TERRORISM, AND, MOST ESPECIALLY, VIOLENCE IN THE NAME OF </p><p>RELIGION, FURTHER REPRESENTED A VERY PERSONAL RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>GLOBAL CRISIS PRECIPITATED BY SEPTEMBER 11 (REF. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE POPE CONVOKED THE ASSISI GATHERING IN LATE </p><p>NOVEMBER 2001 IN AN URGENT APPEAL FOR PEACE IN A WORLD </p><p>WOUNDED BY WAR AND TERRORISM.  THE VATICAN HAD LITTLE </p><p>LEAD-TIME TO MOUNT A COMPLEX OPERATION IN LOGISTICS AND </p><p>PROTOCOL.  THE VATICAN HOWEVER IS A VETERAN HAND IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00521  01 OF 03  040621Z </p><p>ORCHESTRATING LARGE EVENTS, ESPECIALLY AFTER HANDLING THE </p><p>MILLIONS OF PILGRIMS DURING THE JUBILEE YEAR.  MOREOVER, </p><p>THERE WERE HELPFUL PRECEDENTS IN ASSISI ITSELF, WHICH HAD </p><p>HOSTED LARGE INTERFAITH GATHERINGS IN 1982, 1986 AND 1993. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) IN 1982 POPE JOHN PAUL II LAUNCHED THE ASSISI </p><p>MEETINGS WITH A LARGE-SCALE COMMEMORATION OF THE 700TH </p><p>BIRTHDAY OF SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI, THE CELEBRATED UMBRIAN </p><p>SAINT OF POVERTY AND PEACE (WHO ALSO TRIED HIS HAND AT </p><p>DIPLOMACY WHEN HE TRAVELED TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO SEEK AN END </p><p>TO THE CRUSADES).  IN 1986 THE POPE RETURNED TO ASSISI </p><p>FLANKED BY MYRIAD RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN AN APPEAL TO END THE </p><p>DANGEROUS DIVISIONS OF THE COLD WAR. IN 1993 JOHN PAUL II </p><p>CONVOKED A SMALLER GATHERING IN ASSISI TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS </p><p>IN THE BALKANS. THE 1986 MEETING IN PARTICULAR BECAME THE </p><p>TOUCHSTONE FOR SUBSEQUENT VATICAN EFFORTS IN INTERFAITH </p><p>RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL DIALOGUE. OTHER INTERFAITH </p><p>GATHERINGS, NOTABLY UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE COMMUNITY OF </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO, INVARIABLY INVOKE THE SPIRIT OF THE 1986 MEETING </p><p>IN ASSISI. </p><p> </p><p>ASSISI IN 2002: THE VATICAN TAKES ON THE CLASH OF </p><p>CIVILIZATIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) IN THE WAKE OF SEPTEMBER 11 THE VATICAN HAS SOUGHT </p><p>TO COUNTER PERCEPTIONS OF A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS. ITS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE U.S.-LED CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM HAS </p><p>CONSISTENTLY BEEN TEMPERED BY EFFORTS TO DEFUSE ANY RELIGIOUS </p><p>ASPECT TO THE CONFLICT. EVEN AS VATICAN OFFICIALS LAUDED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00521  01 OF 03  040621Z </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S OUTREACH TO ISLAM AND HIS VISIT TO AN </p><p>AMERICAN MOSQUE, THE VATICAN HAS BEEN PURSUING ITS OWN </p><p>PROGRAM OF OUTREACH TO MUSLIM LEADERSHIP.  IN SEPTEMBER A </p><p>VATICAN DELEGATION (THAT INCLUDED AN AMERICAN WOMAN WITH A </p><p>VATICAN PASSPORT) TRAVELED TO TEHERAN TO CONTINUE THE </p><p>"DIALOGUE OF CIVILIZATIONS" BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND IRAN. </p><p>IN LATE OCTOBER THE VATICAN AND THE AL-AZHAR ISLAMIC </p><p>UNIVERSITY IN CAIRO MOVED FORWARD THEIR SCHEDULED CALENDAR OF </p><p>MEETINGS IN ORDER TO PRESS QUIET YET TIMELY INTERFAITH </p><p>DISCUSSIONS. IN NOVEMBER POPE JOHN PAUL II CALLED ON </p><p>CATHOLICS TO FAST FOR PEACE ON DECEMBER 14 -- THE LAST DAY OF </p><p>RAMADAN -- FORGING AN UNPRECEDENTED IF SHORT-LIVED MOMENT </p><p>SHARED BETWEEN THE TWO FAITHS.  AND IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS THE </p><p>POPE, WITH INCREASING EMPHASIS, HAS CONDEMNED VIOLENCE </p><p>PERPETRATED IN THE NAME OF RELIGION, IN EFFECT REPUDIATING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4331 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00521  02 OF 03  040621Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   VCE-00   NEA-00 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  SS-00    T-00     SNIS-00  NISC-00  DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------6174F8  040621Z /38 </p><p>P 040601Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO ALGERIA COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>ISLAMIC CONFERENCE COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CAIRO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY RIYADH PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL JEDDAH PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MARSEILLE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 VATICAN 000521 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EUR/WE (D.

"THERE IS NO RELIGIOUS GOAL WHICH </p><p>POSSIBLY CAN JUSTIFY THE USE OF VIOLENCE BY MAN AGAINST MAN," </p><p>THE POPE REITERATED IN ASSISI, IN THE PRESENCE OF SOME THIRTY </p><p>MUSLIM RELIGIOUS LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00521  02 OF 03  040621Z </p><p>6.  (SBU) WHILE THE POPE\'S OWN ASSISI PROCLAMATION "VIOLENCE </p><p>NEVER AGAIN!  WAR NEVER AGAIN!  TERRORISM NEVER AGAIN!" </p><p>DOMINATED THE HEADLINES, THERE WERE A NUMBER OF INTERVENTIONS </p><p>READ BY OR ON BEHALF OF LEADERS OF DIFFERENT FAITHS, CREEDS, </p><p>AND DENOMINATIONS. EACH STATEMENT HAD ITS OWN ACCENT AND </p><p>IDENTITY, WITH NO EVIDENT PLOYS FOR SECTARIAN OR ETHNIC </p><p>ADVANTAGE. SHEIK MOHAMMED AL-TANTAWI, HEAD OF CAIRO\'S </p><p>AL-AZHAR MOSQUE, WAS ABSENT, YET SENT A DECLARATION READ BY A </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE.  THE STATEMENT, A COMMITMENT TO THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF DIALOGUE, DID RAISE EYEBROWS HOWEVER, LAUDING </p><p>POPE JOHN PAUL II AS A CHAMPION OF PALESTINIANS AND OMITTING </p><p>ANY MENTION OF JUDAISM OR THE RABBINICAL PRESENCE ON STAGE. </p><p>YET FOR THE VATICAN INDIVIDUAL STATEMENTS COUNTED LESS THAN </p><p>THE FACT AND WITNESS OF EACH LEADER\'S PRESENCE, NOTABLY THE </p><p>MUSLIM AND ORTHODOX REPRESENTATIVES.  "THE VERY FACT THAT WE </p><p>ARE LISTENING TO ONE ANOTHER," THE POPE SAID, "IS A SIGN OF </p><p>PEACE." </p><p> </p><p>THE SECOND FRONT: ADVANCING RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE ORTHODOX. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) THE ASSISI ENCOUNTER INCLUDED A HOST OF ORTHODOX </p><p>PATRIARCHS, THUS MARKING A KEY STEP FORWARD IN THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>OUTREACH TO EASTERN CHRISTIANITY. THE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH OF </p><p>CONSTANTINOPLE, BARTHOLOMEW, WHO HAS MET THE POPE SEVERAL </p><p>TIMES, LENT LEGITIMACY AMONG ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS TO THE </p><p>GATHERING.  THE TRUE WATERSHED HOWEVER WAS THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH\'S PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE, </p><p>METROPOLITAN PITRIM.   VATICAN WATCHERS WERE QUICK TO READ </p><p>INTO THE METROPOLITAN\'S PRESENCE HOPES OF A SOFTENING IN THE </p><p>RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH\'S HITHERTO STRENUOUS OPPOSITION TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00521  02 OF 03  040621Z </p><p>A PAPAL VISIT TO RUSSIA, REITERATED PUBLICLY ONLY DAYS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY.  INDEED, FIDES, A VATICAN-BASED NEWS-SERVICE, </p><p>CALLED THE HIGH CALIBER OF ORTHODOX SUPPORT FOR THE ASSISI </p><p>MEETING  "AN UNHOPED FOR STEP CLOSER FOR CHRISTIANS OF EAST </p><p>AND WEST, UNTHINKABLE ONLY MONTHS AGO." </p><p> </p><p>ASSESSMENT:  A COUP FOR THE VATICAN. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) THE ASSISI GATHERING GENERATED ALMOST ENTIRELY </p><p>POSITIVE PRESS FOR THE VATICAN.  IT REINFORCED THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>CAREFULLY CULTIVATED IMAGE AS A MODERN AGENT OF DIALOG </p><p>BETWEEN CULTURES.  IT PROMOTED THE POPE\'S UNIQUE CLAIM TO </p><p>SPEAK AS A UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED MORAL AUTHORITY.  THE </p><p>VATICAN ITSELF ADVANCED ITS AGENDA OF GREATER RAPPROCHEMENT </p><p>WITH THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES, THOUGH A PAPAL TRIP TO RUSSIA </p><p>REMAINS FOR NOW A DISTANT POSSIBILITY. AT ASSISI THE VATICAN </p><p>ALSO TOOK THE OCCASION TO SHOWCASE THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES -- </p><p>E.G. THE SYRO ORTHODOX PATRIARCHATE OF ANTIOCH, THE ARMENIAN </p><p>APOSTOLIC CHURCH, THE ARMENIAN CATHOLICOSATE OF CILICIA, ETC. </p><p>-- WHOSE RELIGIOUS LEADERS WERE A MEDIA SENSATION IN THEIR </p><p>STRIKING CLERICAL GARB. THEIR PRESENCE IN ASSISI WAS A </p><p>SALIENT REMINDER THAT THE OVERARCHING ISSUE FOR THE VATICAN </p><p>IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND OFTEN ELSEWHERE IS THE PROTECTION OF </p><p>IMPERILED CHRISTIAN MINORITIES.  FINALLY, AND MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>IN THE NEAR TERM, THE ASSISI MEETING PROVIDED AN INTERFAITH </p><p>IMPRIMATUR TO THE VATICAN\'S POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS STRATEGY </p><p>TO ENSURE THAT THE AFTERMATH OF SEPTEMBER 11 DOES NOT EVOLVE </p><p>INTO A WAR BETWEEN RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>ALL ABOARD!

IN A FITTING SYMBOL, JOHN PAUL II AND OVER 300 RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERS DEPARTED TOGETHER FOR ASSISI FROM THE VATICAN RAIL </p><p>STATION, ITS FIRST USE FOR PAPAL TRAVEL SINCE 1979.  DUBBED </p><p>THE PEACE TRAIN, IT WAS A MEDIA METAPHOR FOR THE ASSISI </p><p>MEETING, EMBARKING THE RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP ON A JOURNEY WITH </p><p>A COMMON PURPOSE. IN MANY RESPECTS, ASSISI WAS A FORUM FOR </p><p>POLITICS BY OTHER MEANS, NOT JUST FOR THE VATICAN BUT FOR </p><p>OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS, TOO, WHO WERE FURNISHED A READY-MADE </p><p>STAGE ON WHICH TO ATTEST THEIR COMMITMENT TO PEACE AND </p><p>DIALOG. </p><p> </p><p>FOSTERING CROSS-CULTURAL DIALOG. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4332 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00521  03 OF 03  040622Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   VCE-00   NEA-00 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  SS-00    T-00     SNIS-00  NISC-00  DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------6174FE  040622Z /38 </p><p>P 040601Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO ALGERIA COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>ISLAMIC CONFERENCE COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CAIRO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY RIYADH PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL JEDDAH PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MARSEILLE PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 VATICAN 000521 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EUR/WE (D.

HOWEVER, </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11, HE SAID, HERALDED A SEA CHANGE. RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERS NOW INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED THAT ISLAM HAD A DUTY TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED IN ITS NAME AND TO COMBAT </p><p>WIDESPREAD IGNORANCE ABOUT NON-MUSLIMS.  HE ADDED THAT SOME </p><p>FORMERLY CRITICAL COLLEAGUES, WHO THEMSELVES ESCHEWED ALL </p><p>CONTACT WITH NON-MUSLIMS, HAD NOW EXPRESSED NEWFOUND </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL OUTREACH.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>THERE WAS GREAT IGNORANCE CONCERNING NON-MUSLIMS, A NEED FOR </p><p>EDUCATION, AND FOR CONTACT WITH NON-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS LEADERS </p><p>OF GOOD WILL.
