(U)  Foreign Minister Nien has written to the Secretary </p><p>ostensibly to cite progress in bilateral ties but in reality </p><p>to complain about the likely reintroduction in Congress of </p><p>the Vietnam Human Rights Act and passage or expected passage </p><p>at the city and state levels of various "flag bills" </p><p>mandating the usage of the former South Vietnam flag </p><p>(reftel).  He specifically asked for help in opposing both </p><p>initiatives.  The Foreign Ministry will undoubtedly expect a </p><p>response.  Embassy will pouch original to EAP/BCLTV.

(U)  text of letter </p><p>quote </p><p>Minister for Foreign Affairs </p><p>The Socialist Republic of Vietnam </p><p> </p><p>Hanoi, March 26, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>TO:  H.E. Mr. Colin L. Powell </p><p>Secretary of State </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>U.S. Department of State </p><p> </p><p>Dear Mr. Secretary, </p><p> </p><p>I am writing to express my satisfaction with the recent </p><p>positive development in Vietnam-U.S. relations.  Well under </p><p>way are the talks aimed at speeding up the implementation of </p><p>the Vietnam-U.S. Bilateral Trade Agreement and the Science </p><p>and Technology Agreement.  The first round of talks on a </p><p>Textile Agreement has been initiated and the last productive </p><p>round of negotiation on the Aviation Accord has helped to </p><p>narrow down the two sides\' differences in this matter. </p><p>Notably, the success of the 13rd Annual Asia Corporate </p><p>Conference recently held in Hanoi by the Asia Society and </p><p>Dow Jones & Company in collaboration with Vietnamese </p><p>relevant agencies, has contributed to strengthening the </p><p>investment and trade ties as well as the mutual </p><p>understanding between our two countries. </p><p> </p><p>To ensure further development of the two countries\' </p><p>relations along this positive line, it is most essential to </p><p>create a favorable political environment.  And you would </p><p>agree with me this requires constructive efforts from both </p><p>sides. </p><p> </p><p>As you may know, more than a year ago, the U.S. House of </p><p>Representatives\' passage of the Bill H.R. 2833 on Human </p><p>rights in Vietnam resulted in a profound and widespread </p><p>disappointment among the Vietnamese people.  Fortunately, </p><p>thanks to the understanding and cooperation of the U.S. </p><p>members of congress, particularly with the kind attention </p><p>and efforts of yourself and your staff, this bill has been </p><p>dropped.  However, some U.S. congressmen have recently been </p><p>trying to re-introduce this very bill to the House of </p><p>Representatives.  Negative impact on the Vietnam-U.S. </p><p>relationship would therefore be extremely grave.  Moreover, </p><p>while noting with appreciation the cooperation of the U.S. </p><p>Government and your State Department in handling the Bill No </p><p>2829 of the House of State of Virginia related to the </p><p>deceased Saigon regime\'s flag, we are now very much </p><p>concerned about recent moves by some City Councils in </p><p>several cities, namely, Westminster, Garden Grove, </p><p>California.  They have endorsed resolutions allowing the </p><p>flag to be displayed at public buildings, schools, and at </p><p>public functions of the Vietnamese-American community in </p><p>those cities.  Moreover, we have just learned that the draft </p><p>resolution ACR 68 is now being introduced at the Assembly of </p><p>California.  Such actions have rekindled the past of hated </p><p>among the Vietnamese-American communities in several other </p><p>cities such as San Jose, Oakland, Santa Ana, Midway City, </p><p>Huntington Beach, undermining the on-going process of </p><p>national reconciliation and unity of the whole population of </p><p>Vietnam.  At the same time, these actions have sent wrong </p><p>signals about the U.S. Government policy as well as its </p><p>observance of the law in this regard, namely to recognize </p><p>only the National Flag of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam </p><p>in our bilateral diplomatic relations.  Such above-mentioned </p><p>developments are causing great disappointment within the </p><p>Government and the entire people of Vietnam, obstructing the </p><p>on-going process of mutual understanding promotion and </p><p>damaging our greater and long-term interests in the Vietnam- </p><p>U.S. relations. </p><p> </p><p>I do hope that, with your noble and responsible position, </p><p>you and your capable staff in the Department of State would </p><p>take all appropriate and timely measures to prevent and </p><p>remove for good the Vietnam Human Rights Bill as well as the </p><p>issue of allowing the display of the former regime\'s flag </p><p>from our bilateral relations.  This will make a necessary </p><p>move to contribute to our joint efforts to go beyond the </p><p>past and towards the future, in line with the realities and </p><p>vast interests of the relations between the Governments and </p><p>peoples of Vietnam and the United States. </p><p> </p><p>Please accept, Mr. Secretary, the renewed assurances of my </p><p>highest consideration.  I look forward to meeting you in </p><p>person to discuss new steps to accelerate our bilateral </p><p>relations. </p><p> </p><p>Yours sincerely, </p><p> </p><p>/s/ Dy Nien  /s/ </p><p>Nguyen Dy Nien </p><p>end quote </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
