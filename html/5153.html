(C) Summary and comment:  Two months into its </p><p>administration, the AK Government has not yet clearly defined </p><p>its domestic energy strategy, except to announce general </p><p>support for liberalization and its desire to decrease </p><p>electricity prices.  Although the Energy Market Regulatory </p><p>Authority (EMRA) is now operational, there has been no </p><p>progress on the privatization of energy assets since May </p><p>2002.  EMRA is still grappling with the how to implement the </p><p>electricity and gas market laws, while continuing to honor </p><p>the government\'s long-term gas and electricity contracts. </p><p>EMRA and the Energy Ministry want to cut prices by </p><p>renegotiating contracts with the five BOT plants in </p><p>operation, including U.S.-owned companies Trakya Elektrik and </p><p>Doga Energi.  This approach likely will have a negative </p><p>impact on the investor climate.  There has been no progress </p><p>on the pending BOT/TOR projects, leading one U.S. company to </p><p>file an arbitration case against the government.  We will </p><p>continue to urge the government to honor existing contracts </p><p>or reach mutually agreeable solutions with the companies. </p><p>End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slow Progress on Market Liberalization </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Prime Minister Gul, Energy Minister Guler, and other </p><p>AK party officials have stated at various forums and to the </p><p>press that cutting electricity prices will be one of the </p><p>government\'s top energy priorities.  At a recent energy </p><p>conference, Minister Guler set out three additional goals: </p><p>creating a competitive environment through liberalization and </p><p>transparency; giving priority to natural resources to </p><p>mitigate the increasing role of imported fuels such as gas; </p><p>and taking an environmentally responsible approach to energy, </p><p>including promotion of renewable energy and new energy </p><p>technologies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Due in part to the difficulty of the task and in </p><p>part to the change in government, progress on the </p><p>liberalization front has been slow (note:  the electricity </p><p>market law calls for liberalization to be completed by </p><p>end-2003).  The electricity generation and distribution </p><p>assets identified by the Ministry of Energy in May 2002 for </p><p>privatization have not yet been taken into the scope of the </p><p>Privatization Administration.  The Energy Market Regulatory </p><p>Authority (EMRA) is still grappling with the mechanics of </p><p>implementing the electricity and gas market laws.  The major </p><p>task:  balancing liberalization with the long-term gas and </p><p>electricity contracts to which the government is party.  The </p><p>EMRA Vice-President for Electricity told us recently that, as </p><p>long as the government is bound by long-term electricity </p><p>purchase contracts, it will be impossible to attract new </p><p>companies to the market.  On gas market liberalization, EMRA </p><p>has not yet determined how BOTAS will transfer its long-term </p><p>import contracts to the private sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) On the positive side, EMRA is now fully operational. </p><p> It is receiving license applications and has started issuing </p><p>operating licenses.  In December 2002, EMRA issued licenses </p><p>for the main lignite, fuel oil, and natural gas plants owned </p><p>by EUAS, the state generating company.  EMRA also announced </p><p>the internal transmission tariff for natural gas, which will </p><p>be based on the "postage," or flat-rate system.  The state </p><p>transmission company, TEIAS, has developed a regional </p><p>transmission tariff pricing scheme, and has made progress on </p><p>the transmission network by acquiring USD 90 million worth of </p><p>new transmission lines, which is being financed in part by a </p><p>World Bank loan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cutting Electricity Prices by Renegotiating Contracts </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) AK has made cutting electricity prices a top energy </p><p>priority; however, because most of the costs are fixed, it </p><p>will be a difficult goal to achieve without Turkish Treasury </p><p>paying for it.  In its defense, AK inherited a multitude of </p><p>problems that contribute to high prices, including an </p><p>oversupply of gas purchased through expensive, long-term gas </p><p>contracts; a number of relatively expensive electricity </p><p>purchase obligations; an inefficient billing and collection </p><p>system; and significant losses due to network leakage and </p><p>pilferage. </p><p>6. (C) Although EMRA Chairman Yusuf Gunay told us he resents </p><p>the government meddling with electricity prices, he has asked </p><p>the operating BOT companies (including U.S.-owned companies </p><p>Trakya Elektrik and Doga Energi) to consider re-negotiating </p><p>their contracts.  Gunay suggested to the companies in a </p><p>January 13 meeting that the Ministry of Energy might be </p><p>flexible on extending the BOT contracts, if they could be </p><p>flexible on purchase guarantees and prices.  (Note:  As </p><p>reported ref a, Trakya and Doga filed suit against EMRA in </p><p>October 2002, claiming that EMRA\'s requirement that they </p><p>apply for licenses is a breach of contract.  Company </p><p>representatives will bring EMRA\'s latest proposal to their </p><p>boards before responding.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Energy Minister Guler told Ambassador in a January 15 </p><p>meeting (septel) that the price of electricity the government </p><p>was obligated to purchase from the five BOT plants in </p><p>operation was far too expensive and he (the Minister) "needed </p><p>to find a solution."  Guler emphasized, however, that he was </p><p>"keenly aware" of the need to find a solution that would not </p><p>scare foreign capital.  He said he was working to find a </p><p>"delicate balance." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pending BOT/TOR Projects </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) The press reported January 15 that the government had </p><p>decided to cancel the 29 pending BOT projects.  According to </p><p>the press, those companies with international arbitration </p><p>clauses in their contracts will be able to apply to </p><p>arbitration for compensation of their losses.  Ministry of </p><p>Energy officials have not been able to confirm these press </p><p>reports, but we are following up.  On the TOR contracts, </p><p>Kanel (which is jointly owned by NRG-Peabody and Koc), </p><p>applied for international arbitration at the ICC in Geneva on </p><p>December 12, claiming development and lost profit damages due </p><p>to the GOT,s failure to follow through with the project. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) While we sympathize with the government\'s desire to </p><p>decrease electricity prices, targeting existing BOT operators </p><p>likely will have a negative impact on the investor climate in </p><p>Turkey, especially if the government\'s approach is </p><p>heavy-handed.  The best way for the government to lower </p><p>energy prices is to promote economic reform and growth (to </p><p>balance the electricity surplus), continue on the path of </p><p>liberalization, and improve collections.  We will continue to </p><p>make this point to the new government, and urge that it honor </p><p>existing contracts or reach mutually agreeable solutions with </p><p>the companies.  Otherwise, Turkey likely will face more cases </p><p>of international arbitration, which will be expensive and </p><p>damaging to the foreign investment climate.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
