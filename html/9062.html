<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003931 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>STATE PASS TO TDA FOR STEINGLASS/SIGLER </p><p>STATE PASS TO OPIC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ETRD, ENRG, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: OIL AND JOBS FOR JORDAN: AMERICAN FIRM HAS BIG </p><p>PLANS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Washington Group International (WGI) </p><p>executives updated post on lurching, but continuing, progress </p><p>on the commissioning of a magnesium oxide plant for the Arab </p><p>Potash Company (APC) and shared ideas on proposed energy </p><p>synergies that could result in significant cost savings and </p><p>job growth in Jordan\'s Dead Sea area.  They also told the </p><p>Ambassador that WGI would seek TDA support for a feasibility </p><p>study of a newly developed oil shale extraction process that </p><p>would enable the company to produce over 100,000 barrels of </p><p>crude oil per day in Jordan at economical production costs. </p><p>  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>MAG OXIDE PLANT: NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) WGI Executive Vice President Gil Clausen and Vice </p><p>President James Shultz paid a courtesy call on Ambassador </p><p>Gnehm and Econoffs June 25.  The purpose of their visit was </p><p>to update the Ambassador on current projects, WGI\'s </p><p>relationship with the Arab Potash Company (APC), and </p><p>prospects for new sources of energy and fuel in Jordan.  WGI, </p><p>a global engineering, construction, environmental and mining </p><p>company is nearing completion of a magnesium oxide producing </p><p>plant in Jordan for APC. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) WGI took over the contract from a pair of German </p><p>and Turkish companies to build the magnesium oxide plant and </p><p>bring it into operation.  Clausen said that although the </p><p>German and Turkish companies left a mess behind them, the </p><p>plant was presently in its final commissioning stages. </p><p>However, difficult market conditions, which include prices </p><p>that are below "economic feasibility", and an extremely </p><p>competitive environment, meant that the project was not "out </p><p>of the woods" yet.  Clausen said despite the questionable </p><p>economics of the project, WGI was still looking forward to </p><p>its completion and hopeful of its success. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>AND JOBS AS WELL </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) More broadly, Clausen said that Dead Sea mining had </p><p>vast unexploited commercial and economic potential.  He said </p><p>WGI looked at the sector in its entirety, in contrast with </p><p>the GOJ\'s "one project at a time" view of the region and its </p><p>potential.  He said that the area\'s main need was for energy. </p><p> Construction of a power plant fired by natural gas piped in </p><p>from Egypt via Aqaba could provide power for APC, Jordan </p><p>Bromine, the magnesium oxide plant, a possible future </p><p>magnesium metal plant, and, potentially, for Israeli industry </p><p>on the other side of the Dead Sea.  Clausen said an </p><p>"independent power complex on the Dead Sea" could fulfill the </p><p>entire 220 megawatt need of the mining concerns on the </p><p>Jordanian shore of the Sea and still have some surplus gas </p><p>available for sale.  He said he had discussed the idea with </p><p>Planning Minister Bassem Awadallah, who was also in favor of </p><p>the project.  Clausen said the project would provide 10,000 </p><p>jobs in the currently impoverished region. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>OIL IN JORDAN? </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Meanwhile, Clausen told us that a newly-developed </p><p>extraction process could enable WGI to extract from 100,000 </p><p>to 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day from oil shale </p><p>deposits found south of Amman.  Previously recovery costs for </p><p>these deposits had been too high to be economical, but the </p><p>process, developed by Sun Corporation of Canada, could </p><p>produce from 50,000 to 70,000 barrels per day initially, with </p><p>"centuries of reserves" at production costs of $8-10 per </p><p>barrel.  He added that the economics on the project "have </p><p>been reviewed" and that WGI has the right team in place to </p><p>make it happen.  He said that WGI executives have been </p><p>consulting with GOJ officials, including Awadallah and </p><p>Minister of Energy Bataineh, who are eager to get the project </p><p>on the fast track.  The next step, Clausen said, was a </p><p>full-blown feasibility study, about which it would soon be </p><p>approaching the US Trade and Development Agency (TDA). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) WGI\'s comprehensive approach to Dead Sea mining </p><p>merits consideration by the TDA, the GOJ, and interested </p><p>foreign investors.  If the company\'s projections on the oil </p><p>shale and the natural gas plant are realized, the economic </p><p>impact on Jordan and the Dead Sea mining sector may be </p><p>significant.  Post will continue to monitor the progress of </p><p>all of WGI\'s projects, current and proposed, and will lend </p><p>support when appropriate.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
