He suggested they could </p><p>take place at the US Mission to NATO, but insisted that he </p><p>participants must be limited to the U.S. and the EC.  See </p><p>Embassy comment para 16. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  On July 16 a U.S. delegation met with Italian MFA </p><p>Political Director Gianfranco Aragona to discuss the US-EC </p><p>dispute over the Galileo Public Regulated Service (PRS) </p><p>signal overlay of the GPS M-code.  The U.S. delegation was </p><p>led by Ralph Braibanti, Director, Space and Advanced </p><p>Technology, State Department Bureau of Oceans and </p><p>International Environmental and Technical Affairs and </p><p>included Mel Flack, Director, Communications Electronic </p><p>Division, US Mission to NATO; Richard McKinney, Deputy </p><p>Director Space Acquisition, US Air Force; Todd Wilson, EST </p><p>Officer, US Mission to the EU; Marja Verloop EUR/ERA; and </p><p>representatives from the political and science sections of </p><p>Embassy Rome.  Those joining Aragona included Giovanni </p><p>Brauzzi, Director, Office of NATO Affairs, MFA; Sandro </p><p>Bernardin, European Correspondent, MFA; Mario Caporale, </p><p>Navigation Office, Italian Space Agency; and Umberto </p><p>Cantielli, Chief, Navigation Identification Office, Defense </p><p>General Staff, Ministry of Defense. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Delegation Insists Political Solution is needed </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Braibanti told Aragona that the U.S. believes it is </p><p>important to hold informal consultations with key EU member </p><p>States to advance U.S.-EC differences over Galileo towards a </p><p>decision.  He recalled that the President raised M-Code </p><p>overlay at the last U.S.- EU Summit.  In reviewing the USG </p><p>position on Galileo, Braibanti explained that the U.S. </p><p>accepts the EU satellite system as a reality, but the </p><p>security implications of having the Galileo Public Regulated </p><p>Service (PRS) overlay the GPS M-Code are unacceptable to both </p><p>the U.S. and NATO.  so far, the U.S. has fought a defensive </p><p>battle with the European Commission (EC).  Braibanti allowed </p><p>that some progress has been made in convincing European </p><p>officials that direct overlay of M-Code by the PRS is a bad </p><p>idea.  However, consideration being given by the EC to use </p><p>BOC 2.2 for Open Service (OS) also involves a partial overlay </p><p>of M-Code, and damages navigational warfare capabilities. </p><p>The U.S. will be unable to accept this outcome. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Braibanti assured Aragona that the USG is committed </p><p>to finding a solution, but cautioned that without some </p><p>flexibility and compromise from the EC, progress will be </p><p>difficult.  The U.S. has proposed several technical options </p><p>for Galileo PRS and OS that our experts believe meet all </p><p>stated technical and performance requirements for Galileo </p><p>services.  Braibanti underscored that, given the EC\'s </p><p>timetable for making design decisions on Galileo, member </p><p>states may find that the Commission has locked in technical </p><p>solutions that threaten U.S. and NATO capabilities to conduct </p><p>navigational warfare.  To avoid this eventuality, which could </p><p>put allied lives at risk, member states need to give clear </p><p>political guidance now to the EC that the Galileo signal </p><p>structure cannot undermine NAVWAR operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But Aragona Puts Faith in Further Technical Talks </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Aragona, signaling his reluctance to take on U.S. </p><p>concerns vis-a-vis Italy\'s EU partners, underscored that </p><p>Galileo negotiations had been entrusted to the EC.  He </p><p>assured the U.S. team that Italy recognized the security </p><p>issues at stake.  "Given our NATO membership it would be </p><p>crazy for us not to be sensitive to U.S. arguments," Aragona </p><p>declared.  These concerns are shared by the EC, he claimed, </p><p>but any solution must also safeguard the "integrity and </p><p>operability of Galileo for it to be a commercially viable and </p><p>reliable system (Note: Aragona came back repeatedly </p><p>throughout the course of the consultations to this theme. End </p><p>Note). </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Aragona pressed claims by EC experts that technical </p><p>negotiations could lead to a solution to both protect the </p><p>integrity and operability of Galileo and address US security </p><p>concerns.  Referencing the U.S.-EU Summit, Aragona asserted </p><p>that, as an "agreement" had been reached to proceed with </p><p>technical talks, the pace of negotiations to try to reach a </p><p>"technical solution" to the overlay conundrum should be </p><p>intensified.   Italy and the EC are ready to take into </p><p>account U.S. and NATO security concerns and believe that </p><p>technical solutions, which protect them, are available. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Aragona wanted to know when the U.S. would be ready </p><p>to discuss the most recent EC proposals, which he understood </p><p>included a certain "inventiveness" and were "not so stuck in </p><p>the prejudices of the past."  The EC was ready to sit and </p><p>discuss a mutually agreeable technical solution.  As for </p><p>political input, Aragona said once more that the Commission </p><p>is well aware that U.S. security concerns must be addressed </p><p>while taking into account the "integrity" of the Galileo </p><p>system. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Braibanti countered that, with regard to EC </p><p>technical proposals, he was aware of only two to which a </p><p>formal reply had not been given: using filtering to mitigate </p><p>the navigation warfare problems posed by overlaying BOC 2.2, </p><p>and having the U.S. change the frequency for its military GPS </p><p>signals.  In the spirit of cooperation, the U.S. had not </p><p>rejected these ideas out of hand, but instead asked its </p><p>technical experts to analyze them carefully.  Now that he had </p><p>seen the results of this analysis, Braibanti could say with </p><p>some certainty that it is highly unlikely that either of </p><p>these options will work.  Summing up this portion of the </p><p>discussion, Braibanti framed the state of play for Aragona: </p><p>We may well reach a situation in September where we will have </p><p>analyzed the EC\'s proposals and decided they can not provide </p><p>a solution which protects U.S. and NATO capabilities to </p><p>conduct NAVWAR.  Our concern is that if EC technical experts </p><p>continue to operate within their current frame of reference, </p><p>we will arrive at a technical impasse.  To avoid this </p><p>impasse, the EC team needs clear political direction from </p><p>member States that they should focus on options that do not </p><p>negatively impact NAVWAR.  (Note: on the margins of the </p><p>meeting, Braibanti told Aragona that the USG worries the EC </p><p>negotiators may be positioning themselves to argue to the EU </p><p>member states that they had made a good faith effort to reach </p><p>a compromise, but the U.S. would not meet them halfway, so </p><p>Galileo must move ahead without an agreement to cooperate </p><p>with the U.S.  Aragona discounted this possibility, </p><p>suggesting that the EC recognizes the need for Galileo-GPS </p><p>interoperability.  (End Note) </p><p> </p><p>NATO a Non-Starter for Classified Talks </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Aragona said the U.S. and EU face a practical </p><p>problem over where to hold classified discussions and that </p><p>this problem should be easily resolvable.  Italy expects the </p><p>U.S. to provide a formal answer to the letter EC negotiator </p><p>Heinz Hillbrecht sent to Braibanti on July 2 (reftel). </p><p>Aragona maintained that the EC wants further discussions in a </p><p>classified setting, but that setting can not be NATO.  He </p><p>underscored this point in uncharacteristically blunt </p><p>language.  Aragona said holding the talks at the US Mission </p><p> </p><p>to NATO was perfectly acceptable as long as they were U.S.-EC </p><p>rather than NATO-EC discussions.  The issue under discussion </p><p>is between the U.S. and the EC, Aragona argued, and, </p><p>moreover, there are several non-EU members of NATO. </p><p>Braibanti took Aragona\'s points and assured him that the USG </p><p>was considering the issue of additional classified </p><p>discussions, including the modalities for such meetings. </p><p> </p><p>Some Agreement on Procedure, but.... </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  Braibanti, moving the discussion to how and when to </p><p>hold the next plenary negotiating session, said the U.S. will </p><p>work with the Commission on dates for a September meeting to </p><p>review technical and trade issues  He suggested folding the </p><p>technical discussions into the plenary negotiating session. </p><p>This could help to ensure transparency and avoid </p><p>misunderstanding among the political negotiators about the </p><p>available technical options.  Aragona acknowledged that </p><p>Braibanti\'s idea had merit and committed to "see what could </p><p>be done" to make a political recommendation to the EC to </p><p>proceed along these lines. </p><p> </p><p>Still Talking Past Each Other on substance </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  The U.S. delegation raised concerns that France </p><p>might be driving the EC toward a decision counter to the </p><p>interests of other EU member states, the U.S. and NATO.  Mel </p><p>Flack said it was difficult not to arrive at the conclusion </p><p>that France was interested in an M-Code overlay so it could </p><p>guarantee reliability for precision guided weaponry it might </p><p>seek to sell to third countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  "I have objected to Europeans who say that U.S. </p><p>actions demonstrate an intent to undermine Galileo," Aragona </p><p>told the delegation.  "Likewise," he said, " I do not believe </p><p>that there is any maliciousness on the part of a particular </p><p>country or the EC."  Above all, he maintained, Galileo is a </p><p>commercial undertaking; the system\'s signal structure was </p><p>selected according to well established criteria based on the </p><p>belief that it provided the most robust, reliable service. </p><p>"I accept your arguments about the need to jam adversaries in </p><p>a NAVWAR context," he said, but the U.S. "needs to keep in </p><p>mind that Galileo service must be sold.  The problem of </p><p>selective jamming is not just political; commercial aspects </p><p>are also involved."  When Aragona stated it would not be </p><p>acceptable to expect the EU to settle for alternate, less </p><p>robust, signals, Braibanti countered it would be unacceptable </p><p>for the U.S. and its allies to risk the lives of soldiers in </p><p>order to allow the EU to have more robust signals for </p><p>Galileo. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  Aragona acknowledged the point in passing, but </p><p>moved quickly to close and summarize the conversation.  He </p><p>suggested the next step would be to find a suitable venue to </p><p>hold classified discussions.  He claimed there is flexibility </p><p>and that the EU is aware of the need for a solution amenable </p><p>to both sides.  Braibanti emphasized that after the September </p><p>discussions the USG would like to hold another set of </p><p>bilateral consultations with Italy.  Aragona was </p><p>noncommittal, offering to share thoughts after the September </p><p>plenary session and then decide on a way forward.  In terms </p><p>of U.S.-Italian engagement, he said he hoped that discussions </p><p>would not lead to the "extreme" situation in which the U.S. </p><p>and EU would be negotiating on exclusively U.S. terms, by </p><p>which he meant asking the EU to accept moving PRS to another </p><p>frequency band and to only then negotiate a solution.  He </p><p>noted in closing that Italy had its own technological and </p><p>industrial interests to defend. </p><p> </p><p>Better Signals, Less Political Clout from Other GOI Ministries </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  Braibanti, Flack and EST Couns met with Vice </p><p>Minister for Research Guido Possa on July 15.  Possa is </p><p>responsible for the Italian Space Agency and through it for </p><p>Italian participation in ESA.  After a brief explanation of </p><p>the overlay problem and its implications for NAVWAR, Possa </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>immediately understood that a political, and not a technical </p><p>approach was needed to resolve outstanding problems.  Possa </p><p>suggested that the U.S. should work closely with the Germans, </p><p>and in Italy with Minister of Defense Martino, whose </p><p>commitment to NATO and to close cooperation with the U.S. </p><p>were well known.  On the margins of a July 28 </p><p>representational event,  ESTCOUNS and A/POLMINCOUNS raised </p><p>briefly the overlay problem with MINDEF Martino.  Martino </p><p>said that, from his point of view, Galileo was unnecessary </p><p>and a huge waste of money -- one GPS system was enough.  He </p><p>was unaware that the USG now supported Galileo in principle. </p><p>Martino was sensitive to our arguments on the security </p><p>implications of the overlay, but observed that he was </p><p>perceived within the GOI as too pro-American to be of much </p><p>assistance.  He suggested that the Embassy\'s best bet for </p><p>moving the GOI closer to the USG position would be to </p><p>approach U/S to the PM Gianni Letta, who, we note, is PM </p><p>Berlusconi\'s closest political advisor. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  ESTCOUNS, ECONCOUNS, AND USEU ECONCOUNS met July 18 </p><p>with Ministry of Transport Diplomatic Advisor Maraini to </p><p>discuss the Aragona meetings and to seek the perspective of </p><p>the Ministry on the decisions to be taken concerning Galileo </p><p>at the December Transport Council.  Maraini told us that he </p><p>believed that Galileo was now principally a political </p><p>problem, and a problem beyond the competency of the Transport </p><p>Ministry and Transport Council.  In a candid appraisal of </p><p>Hillbrecht-whom Maraini admitted he did not know well--the </p><p>Diplomatic Advisor said that the decision to be taken was </p><p>beyond the competency of Hillbrecht\'s technical committee. </p><p>Maraini understood and agreed with our assessment that very </p><p>little time and scope remained for technical solutions, and </p><p>that an impasse requiring a major political decision by the </p><p>EU was likely.  Maraini is worried about the outcome.  He </p><p>undertook to prepare a note for Minister Lunardi to be sent </p><p>to the Prive Minister before the PM\'s departure for Crawford. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  Embassy Comment:  The U.S. delegation made the trip </p><p>to Rome to follow up on indications from Aragona, made during </p><p>his recent trip to Washington, that he may have been willing </p><p>to carry some water for us with the EC and member states.  We </p><p>were left with the impression that Italy\'s PolDir had instead </p><p>decided to keep his EU hat firmly in place and stick to the </p><p>script of the EC briefing book on Galileo.  Despite </p><p>understanding within the functional ministries of the GOI, </p><p>peeling Aragona, the MFA, and Italy away from the EC position </p><p>will be difficult, judging from Aragona\'s assessment that </p><p>"technical solutions" still offer a way forward.  He threw us </p><p>a quarter of a bone by offering to help give political top </p><p>cover to the expert level technical discussions.  However, </p><p>Aragona\'s implicit insistence that Galileo\'s commercial </p><p>viability may depend on at least a partial M-Code overlay to </p><p>"guarantee" service is troubling for its resemblance to </p><p>French arguments. </p><p> </p><p>17.
