<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0432 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, ADANA, Press Summaries </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>DECEMBER 27, 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for December 27, 2002.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy of </p><p>the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  "WAR GATE" IN SILOPI (SIRNAK) </p><p>(Sabah)  Efforts are underway to open another border </p><p>gate (with Iraq) in Silopi (Sirnak) to prepare </p><p>possible after-effects in the event of a U.S. </p><p>operation against Iraq.  The new gate, Ali Riza </p><p>Efendi, will be used for the passage of between 250- </p><p>500 (sic 250,000-500,000) expected refugees and </p><p>munitions transport.  Upon advice from the Interior </p><p>and Foreign Affairs Ministries, the State Ministry </p><p>for Customs initiated the efforts and chose a </p><p>location 15 kilometers south of Silopi for the </p><p>proposed gate.  Officials said a bridge would also </p><p>be constructed on the Tigris River for direct access </p><p>to the gate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  U.S. MILITARY DELEGATION IN BATMAN </p><p>(Milliyet)  Runway repair works have been completed </p><p>in Batman, which is among military airports to be </p><p>used during the possible U.S. operation against </p><p>Iraq.  The runway, which was insufficient for </p><p>warplanes, has been extended.  Reservations have </p><p>been made in three- and four-star Batman hotels </p><p>beginning in January for U.S. soldiers.  Three cold </p><p>storages have been constructed on the Batman Air </p><p>Base for use as morgues.  Cumhuriyet reported U.S. </p><p>officials who surveyed hotels and hospitals in </p><p>Batman four months ago continue with their </p><p>inspections.  No measures have yet been taken in </p><p>Diyarbakir. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  TANKS ARE ON THEIR WAY </p><p>(Milliyet)  While the proposed U.S. operation has </p><p>entered Turkey\'s agenda, military activities </p><p>intensified in the Southeast, where thermal cameras </p><p>monitor borders 24 hours a day.  Additional units </p><p>were sent to the borderline, with armored units </p><p>finalizing their preparations.  Military vehicles </p><p>transporting tanks were seen on the Diyarbakir- </p><p>Mardin highway.  Tanks sent from Mardin, Sirnak, </p><p>Cizre (Sirnak) and Silopi (Sirnak) to Diyarbakir\'s </p><p>Seventh Corps Command for maintenance are now being </p><p>transferred to their duty posts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  HAKKARI PREPARING FOR POSSIBLE IRAQI REFUGEES </p><p>(Milli Gazete)  The Hakkari Health Directorate </p><p>announced having completed its preparations for a </p><p>possible influx of refugees (from northern Iraq) in </p><p>case of a possible U.S. operation against Iraq.  The </p><p>directorate will establish centers in Guzelkonak </p><p>(Semdinli) and Uzumlu (Cukurca) villages to meet </p><p>refugees\' health-related needs.  Health Director Dr. </p><p>Tahir Ersoz said 32 personnel who will serve in </p><p>these centers had received one month of training at </p><p>the Civil Defense Directorate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  CREDIT FOR ENTREPRENEURS </p><p>(Dunya)  Disbank signed an "Entrepreneur Support </p><p>Credit" agreement with the Kahramanmaras Chamber of </p><p>Commerce and Industry.  Similar agreements had been </p><p>signed in Ankara, Bursa, Diyarbakir and Gaziantep. </p><p>Under the agreement, Disbank will provide small- and </p><p>medium-scale industries (KOBI) with fixed-interest </p><p>and long-term commercial credits ranging from TL 5 </p><p>billion (approx.
