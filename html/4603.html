<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 002301 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/SA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - REIDEL </p><p>TREASURY FOR GENERAL COUNSEL/DAUFHASUER AND DAS FOR </p><p>TERRORISM AND VIOLENT CRIMES/JZARATE </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL/DLAUFMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: NP, PGOV, PTER, SOCI, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: MAOISTS CALL INDEFINITE SCHOOL STRIKE </p><p>STARTING DECEMBER 9 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. The Maoist student arm, All-Nepal National Free Student </p><p>Union-Revolutionary, called for an indefinite school strike </p><p>(or bandh) in Kathmandu Valley starting on December 9th. The </p><p>Maoists are asking the Government of Nepal meet thirteen </p><p>demands to avert the strike. The Government has neither made </p><p>a plan to counter the strike nor has it opened negotiations. </p><p>Today, the Maoists floated an offer to drop the strike, if </p><p>the Government removed the ban on their organization and </p><p>their designation as terrorists. The Lincoln School, attended </p><p>by most of the mission\'s dependent children, intends to hold </p><p>class but has established alternate locations as a </p><p>contingency. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Threatening Children </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. The Maoist-controlled, All-Nepal National Free Student </p><p>Union-Revolutionary (ANNFSU-R), an illegal organization, has </p><p>declared an indefinite school strike (or bandh) in Kathmandu </p><p>Valley starting December 9. The Maoist student union put </p><p>forward thirteen demands it says the government must meet to </p><p>avert the strike. The demands made under the theme, "stop the </p><p>commercialization of the education system," include a fifty </p><p>percent reduction in private and boarding school tuition, the </p><p>elimination of Sanskrit education, job security for teachers, </p><p>and increasing government funding for Tribhuvan University. </p><p>The students warn they will enforce school closures </p><p>Valley-wide, threatening the safety of students, teachers, </p><p>administrators, and facilities. The group has also called for </p><p>nationwide school bandhs for December 11 through the 13. </p><p> </p><p>The Government\'s Silence </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. Nepal\'s Ministry of Education and the Association for </p><p>Private and Boarding Schools of Nepal (PABSON) have called </p><p>for the Maoists to lift the bandh threat. They have not </p><p>issued a response to the Maoist demands. Education </p><p>institutions in the Valley, in the abscence of any security </p><p>directives by the Government, have put into action </p><p>contingency plans by running classes on Saturdays (the </p><p>traditional day off), holding end of term examinations early, </p><p>or adjourning early for winter vacation. The local British </p><p>School and French School, attended by a mix of expatriates </p><p>and Nepalese, plan to remain open during the first week of </p><p>the scheduled bandh and cancel some of their after school </p><p>activities. The Lincoln School, attended by most of the </p><p>mission\'s dependent children and a number of Nepalese, </p><p>intends to hold class but has established alternate locations </p><p>as a contingency. </p><p> </p><p>4. On November 29, the Joint Secretary at the Ministry of </p><p>Education and Sports, Mr. Yuba Raj Pandey, hosted a meeting </p><p>of concerned teacher and education organizations near Singha </p><p>Durbar, the Prime Minister\'s office. The intent was to </p><p>coordinate actions to address the indefinite education bandh. </p><p>As the event closed, two members of the ANNFSU-R brazenly </p><p>rushed Mr. Pandey with a handgun and threatened to shoot him </p><p>if he did not take seriously their thirteen demands. The </p><p>students painted Mr. Pandey\'s face black and fled, waiving </p><p>the gun at the stunned crowd. </p><p> </p><p>5. On December 2, Devi Prasad Ojha, Minister of Education and </p><p>Sports, at a press conference called on donors to help </p><p>resolve the indefinite stike. When questioned by the press </p><p>corps on the Ministry\'s position, Mr. Ojha is quoted as </p><p>saying, "I\'m not in a position to comment on the strikes </p><p>within the edcuation sector. . . . We want all educational </p><p>institutions to run smoothly and be free from politics." </p><p> </p><p>Maoists May Relent </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. The Nepalese press and public responded with widespread </p><p>anger to the threat to their children\'s safety. In recent </p><p>days, the ANNFSU-R appears to have softened its stance. A </p><p>December 3 press article quotes Devendra Parajuli, leader of </p><p>ANNFSU-R, as saying, "We may give second thoughts to forcing </p><p>the closure of educational institutions, if the government </p><p>corrects the mistake of declaring us a terrorist body and </p><p>shows it is ready for talks with us." (Note: The previous </p><p>government banned the ANNFSU-R organization in 2001, labeling </p><p>it terrorist after the collapse of peace talks in November </p><p>2001. End note.) The Government has not commented openly on </p><p>this latest development. The ANNFSU-R stated today that no </p><p>talks are underway with the Government. The softening of the </p><p>student group\'s demands has further confused school </p><p>administrators and parents, leaving some institutions to </p><p>defer a definitive decision until the weekend. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>7. Education, particularly in the Valley, is perceived as the </p><p>gateway to a better life for one\'s children and a guaranteed </p><p>right under the Constitution. The situation exposes the </p><p>Government\'s powerlessness and inability to develop a </p><p>coherent plan of action and the Maoists\' continued callous </p><p>disregard for the welfare and security of children. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
