IF IT IS </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE TO CHANGE THE TEAM\'S ITINERARY, WE </p><p>WILL TRY TO WORK AROUND THIS POTENTIALLY </p><p>SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE.  WE NOTE THAT THE CROATIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES ARE PREPARED TO COOPERATE IN ANY WAY </p><p>THEY CAN.  THEY HAVE AGREED, FOR EXAMPLE, TO </p><p>PROVIDE AN INTERPRETER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WE HAVE SOUGHT TO LOCATE THE WITNESS "V.G." </p><p>WHOSE ACCOUNT OF ATROCITIES AT LUKA WE RECORDED </p><p>IN 93 ZAGREB 731.

THE LOCAL CONTACT IS SEEKING TO GET US </p><p>AN ADDRESS OR MEANS OF CONTACT.  WE WILL ALSO </p><p>CONTACT THE SWEDISH EMBASSY HERE TO SEE IF THEY </p><p>HAVE ANY RECORD WHICH CAN HELP TO LOCATE HIM. </p><p>EMBASSY STOCKHOLM MAY ALSO WISH TO SEEK SUCH </p><p>INFORMATION AS WELL, IF IT CAN BE DONE WITH THE </p><p>UTMOST DISCRETION.  WE NOTE THAT THE WITNESS </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE APPROACHED EXCEPT IN THE MOST </p><p>DISCREET MANNER AND WITH DUE REGARD TO HIS </p><p>REPORTED ANGER THAT THE RISKS HE TOOK IN SHARING </p><p>HIS STORY WITH US (AND, WE ARE TOLD, WITH UN </p><p>SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR MAZOWIECKI) HAVE NOT YET </p><p>BROUGHT ANY TANGIBLE RESULT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FYI: THE "NURSE" FROM LUKA (REFERRED TO IN </p><p>93 ZAGREB 731), WHO REPORTEDLY UNDER COERCION </p><p>HELPED "PREPARE" YOUNG WOMEN FOR MASS RAPE </p><p>SESSIONS WAS REPORTED TO HAVE LEFT CROATIA </p><p>ALMOST ONE YEAR AGO.  OUR CONTACTS DID NOT KNOW </p><p>WHERE SHE WAS NOW. </p><p> </p><p>6.  OUR INITIAL REQUEST TO THE GOC OFFICE OF </p><p>DISPLACED PERSONS AND REFUGEES ELICITED A </p><p>RESPONSE THAT THERE ARE THOUGHT TO BE SOME 8,000 </p><p>REFUGEES IN GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PARTS OF </p><p>CROATIA WHO CAME ORIGINALLY FROM THE BRCKO AREA. </p><p>THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES HERE WHO WOULD HAVE COME </p><p>FROM (AND CONTINUE TO COME FROM) THE PRIJEDOR </p><p>AREA WOULD, WE SUSPECT, BE FAR LARGER. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01155  01 OF 02  221808Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  WE ARE WORKING WITH OTHER CONTACTS IN HOPES </p><p>OF IDENTIFYING A SMALL NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL </p><p>CREDIBLE WITNESSES WHO EXPERIENCED LUKA OR THE </p><p>PRIJEDOR CAMPS FIRST-HAND WITH WHOM THE TEAM </p><p>MIGHT MEET.  WE HAVE ALSO BEEN IN TOUCH WITH </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL "BRCKO CLUB" IN ZAGREB, WHO </p><p>INFORMED US THAT A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL WITNESSES </p><p>FROM BRCKO ARE IN GUNJA, CROATIA, JUST ACROSS </p><p>THE SAVA RIVER FROM BRCKO, (A FOUR TO SIX-HOUR </p><p>DRIVE FROM ZAGREB). </p><p> </p><p>8.  WE PRESUME THE TEAM IS AWARE OF THE NEW </p><p>SERIES OF REPORTS OF SPRING-EARLY SUMMER 1992 </p><p>EVENTS IN THE BRCKO AREA THAT WE HAVE BEEN </p><p>SENDING IN.  THESE INCLUDE:  ZAGREB 945, 941, </p><p>930, 919, 872, AND 827.  OTHER REPORTS IN THIS </p><p>SERIES ARE FORTHCOMING.
