Boggs, Reasons 1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  A group of Tibetan refugees arrested by </p><p>Nepalese authorities in transit to Tibet from India seek a </p><p>royal amnesty on the King\'s upcoming birthday, July 7. </p><p>UNHCR, Post and other diplomatic missions are encouraging the </p><p>GON to grant the requests.  At the urging of UNHCR, Nepal </p><p>released an unaccompanied minor child jailed for two months </p><p>after entering Nepal from Tibet.  Two other undocumented </p><p>Tibetan refugees remain jailed in Kathmandu.  A Tibetan </p><p>community gathering was held on private property June 5, but </p><p>police shut down an April 28 cultural program at a public </p><p>venue to celebrate the birthday of Dharamsala\'s Panchen Lama. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary, con\'t:  The UNHCR Representative in Kathmandu </p><p>briefed visiting officers from the U.S. Mission in China on </p><p>the continued decline in numbers of Tibetan refugee arrivals. </p><p> Both UNHCR and sources at the Tibetan Reception Center </p><p>attributed the drop to greater ease in obtaining Chinese </p><p>passports, possible tighter Chinese control of travelers, and </p><p>the pull-back of Nepal\'s security forces from border areas, </p><p>which allows Tibetans to slip across more easily.  Seeing the </p><p>Dalai Lama and pursuing studies in India continue to be the </p><p>most popular reasons for traveling to India.  Poloff visited </p><p>the Nepalese immigration post at Kodari June 11 to discuss </p><p>their treatment of Tibetan refugees.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Jailed Tibetans Still Seeking Amnesty </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The group of Tibetan refugees arrested in August, </p><p>2001 while attempting to transit Nepal on their way back to </p><p>Tibet from India (Ref A) continue to seek a royal amnesty. </p><p>The King will next grant an amnesty on the occasion of his </p><p>birthday, July 7.  (Note:  Of the original group of eleven, </p><p>one was released into the care of medical professionals at </p><p>the Tibetan Reception Center in Kathmandu due to severe </p><p>emotional distress.  The number went back to eleven, however, </p><p>after one woman gave birth February 19.  End Note.)  Lawyers </p><p>for a local human rights organization have prepared petitions </p><p>for amnesty on behalf of the group. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Post plans to contact Home Ministry officials and </p><p>write to the Prime Minister requesting that favorable </p><p>consideration be given to the amnesty request.  UK and </p><p>Australian Emboffs have indicated to us that they will also </p><p>encourage GON officials to consider granting amnesty, and </p><p>UNHCR informed us that they wrote to the PM June 19 in </p><p>support of the Tibetans\' appeal.  Similar efforts were </p><p>expended in advance of the February 19 Democracy Day, the </p><p>last time the King granted amnesties, but without success </p><p>(Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>Nepal Releases Minor Child </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) UNHCR secured the release June 18 of an unaccompanied </p><p>14-year-old Tibetan arrested in March after entering Nepal </p><p>from Tibet.  According to a UNHCR protection officer, </p><p>repeated entreaties on behalf of the boy fell on deaf ears at </p><p>first.  Only when UNHCR pointed out that Nepal was a </p><p>signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the </p><p>Child--and thus should not lock up minors--did authorities </p><p>agree to release him.  (Note:  Nepal, like its South Asian </p><p>neighbors, has not yet signed the UN Refugee Convention.  End </p><p>Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Tibetan Public Gatherings Still O.K.--In Private </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Kathmandu\'s Tibetans gathered at the Tibetan Reception </p><p>Center June 5 to mark the anniversary of the founding of the </p><p>modern Tibetan system of government headed by the Dalai Lama. </p><p> Nepalese authorities did not interfere with the assembly. </p><p>On April 28, however, a cultural program sponsored by the </p><p>Tibetan Youth Club to mark the thirteenth birthday of Gedhun </p><p>Choekyi Nyima - Dharamsala\'s pick for Panchen Lama - was </p><p>cancelled at the last minute after police told organizers </p><p>they would not let it proceed.  The event was to have been </p><p>held at Kathmandu\'s Academy Hall, a public venue.  Over the </p><p>past year, Nepalese authorities have allowed all manner of </p><p>Tibetan community activities to go forward on private </p><p>property (such as the reception center) but have not </p><p>permitted events at public venues, like that of the April 28 </p><p>program, they construe to have political overtones. </p><p> </p><p>Decline in New Arrivals Continues </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) UNHCR Representative Michel Dupoizat told Emboff and </p><p>visiting China Mission PolOffs recently that the number of </p><p>Tibetans processed by UNHCR at the Tibetan Reception Center, </p><p>operated by the Tibetan community and headed by the Dalai </p><p>Lama\'s representative, Wangchuk Tsering, continues to decline </p><p>following a peak of 3,109 in 1998.  Subsequent annual figures </p><p>for the years 1999, 2000 and 2001 were 2,182, 2,381 and </p><p>1,381, respectively.  Only 323 have arrived in 2002 as of the </p><p>end of May (compared to 816, 665, 833 and 582 for the same </p><p>period in the years 1998-2001.)  Dupoizat stressed that these </p><p>figures cover only those arriving at and processed by the </p><p>Center.  Many others may not reach the Center as they pass </p><p>through Nepal en route to India. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) The Center keeps detailed records on each arrival </p><p>based on whether he or she arrived with passport, without </p><p>passport or as unaccompanied minors.  The three categories </p><p>are further divided into region of origin: Kham, Amdo and </p><p>U-Tsang.  While at the Center, PolOffs met a number of recent </p><p>arrivals.  One group of three had come from the Deqin Tibetan </p><p>Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan province.  After making their </p><p>way on their own to Lhasa, they hired a guide for RMB 2,000 </p><p>per person to take them the rest of the way to Kathmandu. </p><p> </p><p>Chinese Security Cited as Behind Drop in Arrivals </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Asked why numbers at the Reception Center are down, </p><p>Dupoizat and Wangchuk Tsering offered several explanations. </p><p>Dupoziat noted that it is now easier for Tibetans to obtain </p><p>travel documents, making UNHCR assistance unnecessary. </p><p>Citing unconfirmable reports, Dupoizat, echoed separately by </p><p>Tsering, suggested that the Chinese were becoming better at </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>intercepting would-be India-bound travelers.  Lastly, it was </p><p>suggested that the security situation within Nepal, with the </p><p>consequent pullback of security forces from many border </p><p>areas, has made it easier for Tibetans to slip all the way </p><p>through Nepal once across the border. </p><p> </p><p>Background:  Nepal and Tibetan Refugees </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) By way of background, Dupoizat explained that until </p><p>January 1, 1990, the Nepal government allowed Tibetans to </p><p>stay in Nepal as refugees.  Official recognition was spotty, </p><p>however; although Nepalese identity cards were issued to some </p><p>Tibetans resident in Nepal, others did not receive them. </p><p>Beginning in 1990, Nepal allowed new arrivals to transit but </p><p>insisted that they leave for a "third country," which was </p><p>invariably India.  Most Tibetans now arriving in Nepal intend </p><p>to travel on to Dharamsala to see the Dalai Lama or to study, </p><p>either in a secular school or monastery, he noted.  This </p><p>"transit-through" system worked fairly smoothly, he said, </p><p>until about 2000.  However, following the December 25, 1999 </p><p>hijacking of a plane bound from Kathmandu to New Delhi, the </p><p>January 2000 flight to India of the Karmapa, and subsequent </p><p>high-level visits between Nepal and China, the situation in </p><p>Nepal tightened up.  As a result, the Nepal government no </p><p>longer grants permission for UNHCR to send monitoring </p><p>missions to the border with Tibet (Ref E).  Nepal has, </p><p>however, permitted "familiarization" visits to the </p><p>headquarters of border districts for the purpose of </p><p>consulting with officials based there (Ref D). </p><p> </p><p>UNHCR\'s Card System Marks One-Year Anniversary </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>11. (C) To address the continuing need to assist Tibetan </p><p>travelers while meeting the Nepal government\'s concerns, in </p><p>May 2001 UNHCR instituted a system whereby a card is prepared </p><p>for each individual Tibetan arriving at the Tibet Reception </p><p>Center identifying him as a "person of concern" to UNHCR (Ref </p><p>F).  The person is not given the card at this point, however. </p><p> Once the number of individuals at the Center reaches a </p><p>"critical mass" (enough to fill a bus), they are sent to the </p><p>Indian border in the company of a Nepali immigration officer. </p><p> An Office of Tibet staffer accompanies the group all the way </p><p>to Dharamsala, carrying the Tibetans\' cards which he turns </p><p>over to the government-in-exile.  If and when the individual </p><p>decides to return to Tibet, the card is stamped with the date </p><p>he departs for Tibet from Dharamsala.  He then has 30 days to </p><p>transit Nepal to Tibet.  The Nepal Government tacitly, but </p><p>not formally, recognizes this system, and to date no one in </p><p>possession of this card has been detained by Nepalese </p><p>authorities. </p><p> </p><p>Dalai Lama Still a Draw to TRC </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) During a separate meeting with Wangchuk Tsering, head </p><p>of the Center and the Dalai Lama\'s Representative in Nepal, </p><p>Tsering suggested that most Tibetans do, indeed, try to reach </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the Center if only because those arriving in Dharamsala from </p><p>the Center are granted an audience with the Dalai Lama.  Most </p><p>hire a guide to escort them along one of the three or four </p><p>most common mountain routes, which include via Kodari, Humla </p><p>in the west, and Nangpa Pass in the Khumbu region.  Those </p><p>living within 30 kilometers of the border can obtain a Border </p><p>Trade Pass relatively easily (as can Nepalis living on the </p><p>other side of the border).  Others try to get travel passes </p><p>(Ch: tongxing zheng) which will allow them to at least </p><p>approach the border area to make an attempt to slip across. </p><p> </p><p>Refugees Pass Us By, Immigration Officers Say </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) On June 11 Poloff met with Nepalese officials at the </p><p>Kodari border immigration office last visited by Post in May </p><p>2001 (Ref F).  In March 2001 immigration officers there told </p><p>Emboff that they turned over to China approximately 150 </p><p>Tibetans per year (Ref G).  During a May 2001 follow-up </p><p>visit, Emboff heard that this practice had ceased.  On June </p><p>11 Immigration officers repeated the claim that they no </p><p>longer turn over Tibetans to China.  They insisted that </p><p>intending refugees elude detection by sneaking through </p><p>heavily forested areas around the border.  There had been no </p><p>recent interdictions of Tibetans, the officers added. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Post would like to thank Embassy Beijing for its </p><p>contribution to this report. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
