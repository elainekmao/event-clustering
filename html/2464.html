<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000298 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>ROME FOR USMISSION </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, EAID, AORC, PHUM, NP, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: BHUTANESE REFUGEES: NEPAL TO GRANT OPTION OF RETURN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 01 KATHMANDU 2203 </p><p> </p><p>     B. 01 NEW DELHI 8349 </p><p>     C. 01 KATHMANDU 1736 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Michael S. Hoza.  Reason: 1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Nepal intends to grant verified Bhutanese </p><p>refugees the "option of return" to Bhutan and will allow </p><p>those who wish to stay in Nepal to do so, Foreign Ministry </p><p>officials have indicated.  UNCHR views this development as </p><p>extremely positive.  Despite Kathmandu\'s efforts to fix a </p><p>date, Bhutan and Nepal have not yet agreed on arrangements </p><p>for the next Bhutan-Nepal Ministerial.  Nepal still felt </p><p>third parties should be involved in the process, but was not </p><p>yet ready to approach third parties once again for </p><p>assistance.  Nepal\'s offer seems to have been a calculated </p><p>risk to build Bhutanese confidence.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal to Grant Refugees "Option of Return" </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Nepal will grant verified Bhutanese refugees the </p><p>"option of return" to Bhutan, MFA Joint Secretary Gyan </p><p>Chandra Acharya told us in recent meetings.  Nepal would then </p><p>"take care of" those individuals who chose not to repatriate. </p><p> Acharya held back from saying explicitly that those who </p><p>wanted to stay would be allowed to settle in Nepal - "Nepal </p><p>will not force refugees to go back; beyond that we cannot </p><p>say" - although in answering our queries he indicated that </p><p>that was what he meant.  Acharya stated that Nepal still </p><p>wanted Bhutan to agree, "in principle," to accept all its </p><p>nationals back.  On the other hand, Nepal also has concerns </p><p>about how Bhutan would deal with repatriated refugees, and </p><p>understood that some refugees would want to remain in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The UNHCR Representative in Kathmandu commented that </p><p>Nepal\'s offer to give the "option of return" was an </p><p>"extremely positive" breakthrough," and showed Nepal\'s </p><p>flexibility. </p><p> </p><p>Ministerial Meeting Still Elusive </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Nepal has been trying to get Bhutan to agree to a </p><p>Ministerial-level meeting to discuss Bhutanese refugees, </p><p>Acharya said.  (Note:  The two nations last met when at the </p><p>Foreign-Secretary level in early November (Reftel).  At the </p><p>recent SAARC Summit in Kathmandu, the two sides reportedly </p><p>held informal discussions on the refugee issue.  End Note.) </p><p>Nepal wanted to ensure that the meeting would be productive; </p><p>specifically, Kathmandu hoped to "harmonize" positions on </p><p>categorization.  Bhutan was "trying to be a little bit </p><p>flexible," but Nepal remained frustrated by progress to date. </p><p> According to Acharya, Bhutan has agreed that repatriation </p><p>will begin after agreement is reached on categorization, and </p><p>Kathmandu is hopeful that some refugees could be repatriated </p><p>this year. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Acharya added that his side told the Bhutanese that </p><p>Nepal has no designs on Bhutan, and has been trying to </p><p>develop trade, joint ventures, tourism and sports </p><p>competitions between the two countries in an effort to build </p><p>ties with and reassure Thimpu. </p><p> </p><p>Nepal Keen on Third Party Involvement </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Nepal may ask again for the involvement of third </p><p>parties to break a deadlock and move forward, Acharya said </p><p>(Ref B).  Third party involvement in the process will help, </p><p>Nepal insists.  Bhutan does not regard third party </p><p>involvement as so important, Acharya said, although the </p><p>Bhutanese government does not reject it outright.  He stated </p><p>his conviction that third parties should not be kept on the </p><p>margin, but rather should be part of the mainstream. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: Opening Doors </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Nepal\'s decision to grant the refugees the option not </p><p>to go back to Bhutan was a calculated risk to build Bhutan\'s </p><p>confidence.  After an initial burst of euphoria following the </p><p>initiation of the joint verification process early last year, </p><p>the Nepalis have become increasingly frustrated at the slow </p><p>pace of the process to date, and have repeatedly asked for </p><p>U.S. help in influencing Bhutan to move the process forward. </p><p>The "option of return" policy was their own effort to get it </p><p>moving.  For better or worse, the policy opens a door that, </p><p>once ajar, cannot be closed. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
