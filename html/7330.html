<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 000798 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 4/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, PHUM, HR, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA/ICC/ARTICLE 98: NO EU PRESSURE BUT GOC NOT </p><p>READY TO NEGOTIATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 92117 </p><p> </p><p>     B. TBILISI 778 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF ROB SILBERSTEIN, REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) WE HAVE NOT DETECTED ANY BLATANT EU PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>GOC NOT TO NEGOTIATE AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH US. </p><p>HOWEVER, FOR THE MOMENT, THE EU DOES NOT NEED TO STRONG-ARM </p><p>    THE CROATIANS.  THE GOC IS NOWHERE NEAR TAKING A DECISION ON </p><p>OPENING FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH US ON ARTICLE 98, LET ALONE </p><p>READY TO CONCLUDE AN AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) PRIME MINSTER RACAN TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON A NUMBER OF </p><p>OCCASIONS THAT HE UNDERSTANDS OUR REQUIREMENTS AND IS WILLING </p><p>TO REACH AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT.  THAT BEING SAID, RACAN AND </p><p>OTHER GOC OFFICIALS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE GOC, WITH ITS </p><p>EU AMBITIONS, DOES NOT WANT TO BE OUT IN FRONT OF THE EU AND </p><p>IS WAITING TO SEE THE RESULTS OF OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH KEY EU </p><p>STATES.  THE GOC\'S IDEA WOULD BE TO CONCLUDE AN AGREEMENT </p><p>MODELED ON WHATEVER THE USG AND EU STATES WORK OUT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SOME LOCAL OBSERVERS HAVE QUESTIONED WHY THE GOC </p><p>SHOULD TRANSFER CROATIAN CITIZENS TO THE ICTY WHILE GRANTING </p><p>U.S. CITIZENS PROTECTION FROM THE ICC.  NEVERTHELESS, RACAN </p><p>INDICATED TO THE AMBASSADOR THAT ICTY LINKAGES WOULD NOT/NOT </p><p>BE AN OBSTACLE TO CONCLUDING AN AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, THE ICTY </p><p>ISSUE COULD COMPLICATE PARLIAMENT RATIFICATION OF AN ARTICLE </p><p>98 AGREEMENT -- PARTICULARLY IN AN ELECTION YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ON APRIL 5, ASSISTANT MINISTER OF DEFENSE JELENA </p><p>GRCIC-POLIC TOLD US THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE </p><p>GOC\'S WAIT-FOR-THE-EU APPROACH ON ARTICLE 98.  GRCIC-POLIC </p><p>SAID MINISTER OF DEFENSE ZELJKA ANTUNOVIC WAS AWARE OF THE </p><p>MILITARY ASSISTANCE CUTOFF IMPLICATIONS OF AMERICAN </p><p>SERVICEMEBERS PROTECTION ACT (ASPA).  WHILE ANTUNOVIC WOULD </p><p>SUPPORT EFFORTS TO REACH A DEAL, SHE WAS NOT A PLAYER ON THE </p><p>ISSUE.  THE ASSISTANT MINISTER TOLD US THAT THERE WAS STRONG </p><p>OPPOSITION TO AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT FROM THE OFFICE OF </p><p>PRESIDENT MESIC.  MOREOVER, GRCIC-POLIC SAID THAT, WITHOUT </p><p>    FIRM INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO PROCEED IN THE </p><p>ABSENCE OF AN EU MODEL AGREEMENT, THE MFA WOULD NOT BEGIN </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS, DESPITE THE JULY 1 ASPA DEADLINE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) GRCIC-POLIC SPECULATED THAT PRE-ELECTION MANEUVERING </p><p>AND FEAR OF DAMAGING CROATIA\'S EU ASPIRATIONS -- BY JULY 1, </p><p>CROATIA\'S APPLICATION WILL HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO THE </p><p>COMMISSION FOR THE AVIS PROCESS -- WOULD LEAD RACAN TO FORGO </p><p>IMET AND FMF FUNDING RATHER THAN CONCLUDE AN AGREEMENT NOT </p><p>SHIELDED BY PRIOR EU AGREEMENTS.  SHE FEARED THAT, IF A </p><p>CUTOFF OCCURRED, RACAN AND MESIC WOULD SEEK TO MAKE POLITICAL </p><p>HAY BY TRUMPETING GOC "MORAL DECISIVENESS" IN THE FACE OF </p><p>U.S. PRESSURE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) WE WARNED GRCIC-POLIC THAT, WITH TIME HAVING PASSED, </p><p>THE GOC STRATEGY OF WAITING FOR EU STATES TO TAKE THE LEAD IS </p><p>FLAWED AND THE GOC SHOULD BEGIN NEGOTIATING WITH US IN </p><p>EARNEST: BECAUSE THE ASPA EXEMPTS NATO MEMBERS FROM THE </p><p>MILITARY ASSISTANCE CUTOFF, KEY EU STATES DO NOT FEEL A SENSE </p><p>OF URGENCY.  WE ALSO CAUTIONED THAT A PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER </p><p>SHOULD NOT BE PRESUMED.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO REMIND THE GOC </p><p>OF THE IMPENDING JULY 1 DEADLINE AND URGE THEM TO BEGIN TO </p><p>WORK QUIETLY AND CONSTRUCTIVELY TOWARDS AN AGREEMENT THAT </p><p>SECURES US BILATERAL PROTECTION FROM THE ICC. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
