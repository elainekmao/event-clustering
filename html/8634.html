<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 003454 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR ECA/PE/C/CU (SROUSE); INFO NEA/PPD (BMOONEY; </p><p>DMACCINES); NEA/ARN, DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP,  KPAO,  OEXC,  SCUL,  JO </p><p>SUBJECT: 2003 Jazz Ambassadors Fall Tour </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   PAS wishes to be included in the Jazz Ambassadors </p><p>Program for the fall FY03.  We request the Jazz Ambassadors, </p><p>Freddie Bryant and Kaleidoscope for four or five program </p><p>days during their fall tour.  We are very enthusiastic about </p><p>the opportunity. There is a great interest here in Latin </p><p>jazz, but opportunities for live concerts are extremely </p><p>scarce, airplay is limited, and CDs and tapes are relatively </p><p>expensive for the general public. </p><p> </p><p>2. Program supports MPP goal of promoting Jordanian </p><p>understanding and appreciation of U.S. society, culture and </p><p>institutions.  In accordance with mission policy, the </p><p>musicians will be met at the airport upon arrival.  During </p><p>their program, staff will accompany them to all concerts, </p><p>and other venues.  While in country, the musicians will be </p><p>staying in RSO approved accommodations. </p><p> </p><p>3. In the aftermath of war in the region, it has become even </p><p>more important to emphasize the universality of American </p><p>culture and US interest in promoting strong ties with all </p><p>sectors of Jordanian society.  Music is a natural venue for </p><p>these ties, and Latin jazz is extremely popular with </p><p>Jordanian youth from all strata of society, as well as with </p><p>traditional Embassy contacts. Invitees will include members </p><p>of the royal family, high-level officials, business leaders, </p><p>academicians, artists, students and music lovers from the </p><p>general public. Thank you for this opportunity. </p><p> </p><p>4. Control officer is: CAO Donna Winton, telephone: (962) 6- </p><p>592-0101 ext. 2579; fax: (962) 6-592-0121; e-mail: </p><p>dwinton@pd.state.gov.  Please advise.    Berry </p><p></p></div>
