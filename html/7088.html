<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002186 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/03/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, EU, TU, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: DRAFT EU PARLIAMENT REPORT CALLS FOR RADICAL </p><p>REFORMS IN TURKISH GOVERNANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. EMBASSY (KAPLAN)-EUR/SE (SILVERMAN </p><p>     B. GOLLNER-SWEET </p><p>     C. KERO) 3/27 EMAIL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: A clear-sighted but controversial European </p><p>Parliament draft report calls on the GOT to make fundamental </p><p>changes to the Kemalist State in order to meet EU membership </p><p>criteria.  MFA and reportedly a few members of the European </p><p>parliament reject the report as biased; several European </p><p>Embassy contacts praise its content, but say it will not </p><p>impact Turkey\'s EU candidacy.  The report provides an </p><p>incisive, accurate depiction of the basic flaws in Turkey\'s </p><p>democracy.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Dutch Christian Democrat Submits Draft </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Arie Oostlander, a Dutch Christian Democrat, submitted </p><p>a controversial draft report on Turkey\'s EU candidacy March </p><p>25 to the European Parliament\'s Committee on Foreign Affairs, </p><p>Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy.  Oostlander </p><p>serves as the committee\'s Turkey rapporteur.  The report </p><p>calls for fundamental changes to the Kemalist State -- </p><p>including a new Constitution and the elimination of the </p><p>military-dominated National Security Council in its current </p><p>form -- and urges the EU actively to engage the GOT in </p><p>achieving such change. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Report Draws Strong Reactions Pro and Con </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Very few people have seen the draft, which has not </p><p>been approved by the full Foreign Affairs Committee. </p><p>However, Oostlander provided a copy to the MFA, which quickly </p><p>released a statement calling it "subjective" and </p><p>"unconstructive."  Kaan Esener, head of the MFA Council of </p><p>Europe Department, asserted to us that the report goes too </p><p>far in criticizing the Turkish State.  "It attacks the basic </p><p>tenets of the Republic," he said. "I understand what they are </p><p>trying to say, but why be so aggressive?"  Esener claimed </p><p>that the substance and tone of the report reflect what he </p><p>avers is Oostlander\'s "anti-Turkey bias."  Agreeing, Luigi </p><p>Narbone, deputy head of the EU office in Ankara (widely </p><p>considered sluggish and out of touch with reality beyond the </p><p>bureaucratic beltway), dismissed Oostlander as having </p><p>"extreme Christian" views and opposing the idea of a Muslim </p><p>nation in the EU. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Other European diplomats, however, privately praise </p><p>the report, even though they don\'t expect it to influence </p><p>Turkey\'s EU candidacy.  An Ankara-based Dutch diplomat told </p><p>us his only complaint about the report is that it comes too </p><p>late.  The EU accepted Turkey as a candidate in 1999, so why </p><p>did the Parliament wait until 2003 to advocate fundamental </p><p>change, he griped.  A visiting Dutch diplomat noted that the </p><p>EU has agreed to review Turkey\'s candidacy at the Summit in </p><p>December 2004, far too soon to expect the kind of reform </p><p>Oostlander is calling for.  A Danish diplomat called the </p><p>report "excellent," but noted that parliamentary reports </p><p>carry far less weight than reports endorsed by the </p><p>EU-member-state governments.  The Dutch diplomats said they </p><p>have heard that several members of the Foreign Affairs </p><p>Committee are planning significantly to tone down the report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Kemalism An Obstacle to Reform </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Unlike other EU reports on Turkey, Oostlander\'s draft, </p><p>e-mailed to EUR/SE March 27, takes direct aim at several </p><p>fundamental flaws in Turkey\'s Kemalist system that serve to </p><p>undermine democratic reform.  Highlights include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkey\'s authoritarian Constitution, drafted in 1982 under </p><p>a military regime, does not form an appropriate legal basis </p><p>to guarantee the rule of law and fundamental freedoms.  The </p><p>GOT cannot fix the Constitution by amending various articles; </p><p>it must adopt a new Constitution based on European democratic </p><p>principles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Kemalism, the underlying philosophy of the Turkish State, </p><p>implies: 1) an exaggerated fear of the undermining of the </p><p>integrity of the State; 2) an emphasis on the homogeneity of </p><p>Turkish culture; 3) an important role for the military in </p><p>governance; and 4) a very rigid attitude toward religion. </p><p>Kemalism, therefore, constitutes a barrier to EU membership. </p><p>-- Turkish citizens attribute greater importance to the </p><p>military than to other state institutions, including </p><p>Parliament.  It will be necessary in the long term to abolish </p><p>the military-dominated National Security Council in its </p><p>current form. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Military representatives should be withdrawn from civilian </p><p>bodies, such as the high councils on education and media, to </p><p>ensure these bodies\' independence.  Parliament should </p><p>establish control over the military budget as part of the </p><p>national budget. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- In order to make Turkish society more democratic, the GOT </p><p>should pass legislation to encourage the establishment of </p><p>social organizations in the economic, social, and cultural </p><p>fields. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkey must decentralize certain elements of government to </p><p>allow citizens more input into decision-making. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- While the Central and Eastern European EU candidate </p><p>countries enthusiastically dismantled their totalitarian </p><p>structures, Turkey has vacillated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>EU Should Actively Engage GOT </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The report also calls on the EU to adopt "an immediate </p><p>and radical approach" actively to assist Turkey in making the </p><p>necessary reforms to meet EU membership criteria.  Rather </p><p>than observing passively and overlooking fundamental issues, </p><p>Oostlander argues, the EU should state clearly where the </p><p>problems lie and work with the GOT to address them.  The </p><p>report further states: "It cannot be ruled out that Turkey </p><p>will ultimately regard such a thorough-going reform as </p><p>unsustainable in itself, or as not in its interests.  The </p><p>slow rate of implementation of the reforms seems to point in </p><p>this direction.  However, if we assume that Turkey can in </p><p>fact become a full member of the EU, we must not leave any </p><p>scope in the pre-accession process for attempts to evade </p><p>central political decisions." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) This report is controversial not because it is off the </p><p>mark, but because it is dead on.  Oostlander is bluntly </p><p>telling the GOT what many Turks and Turkey watchers know but </p><p>don\'t want to say publicly: that while Kemalism gave </p><p>republican Turkey a start, it has long impeded further </p><p>progress toward Western democracy.  In encouraging active EU </p><p>participation in helping Turkey make breakthrough reforms, </p><p>the report underscores the importance of not losing sight of </p><p>the true nature of Turkish "democracy."  In addition, many of </p><p>the Turkish characteristics illustrated here -- exaggerated </p><p>fear of outsiders and internal "minorities", conflicts over </p><p>religion, military interference in governance -- bedevil U.S. </p><p>and EU negotiations with the GOT across the board. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
