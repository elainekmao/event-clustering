<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 002237 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF A/S SUSAN RICE, AF/S RENDER, BOOTH, GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/26/00 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, PINR, KDEM, PINS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR/TSVANGIRAI MEETING: MDC URGING </p><p>RESTRAINT IN FACE OF ESCALATING ELECTION VIOLENCE, BUT </p><p>INCHING TOWARDS A DEFENSIVE STRATEGY </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 1970 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL OFFICER MAKILA JAMES, REASONS </p><p>1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: IN THE RUN-UP TO THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION, THE MDC IS CONFRONTING INCREASING POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE FROM ZANU-PF, WHICH HAS LEFT FIVE OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY\'S SUPPORTERS DEAD AND HUNDREDS OF RURAL </p><p>AND URBAN BACKERS INJURED.  NEVERTHELESS, MDC PRESIDENT </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI BELIEVES THE ELECTION WILL LIKELY GO </p><p>FORWARD IN JUNE.  THE OPPOSITION PARTY SAYS IT IS </p><p>STRONGLY URGING RESTRAINT AMONG ITS MEMBERS AND BELIEVES </p><p>IT WILL STILL TAKE A MAJORITY OF THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>SEATS.  THE MDC, HOWEVER, IS UNDER PRESSURE FROM ITS </p><p>MEMBERSHIP TO TAKE A MORE DEFENSIVE POSTURE AND HAS </p><p>RECENTLY HINTED THAT IT IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION.  A </p><p>CONFLICT BETWEEN LONDON\'S LABOR AND CONSERVATIVE PARTIES </p><p>IS BLOCKING A COHERENT RESPONSE TO ZIMBABWE\'S DOMESTIC </p><p>PROBLEMS OR SUPPORT FOR THE MDC, ACCORDING TO </p><p>TSVANGIRAI.  THE MDC PRESIDENT CRITICIZED THE U.S. FOR </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WHAT HE PERCEIVED TO BE OUR EMPHASIS ON ENGAGING MUGABE </p><p>ON THE DROC CRISIS AT THE EXPENSE OF PRESSING HIM ON THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S DOMESTIC PROBLEMS.  THE MDC SEES MUGABE AS </p><p>ALMOST OBSOLETE AND IS FOCUSED ON WORKING OUT AN AMNESTY </p><p>DEAL FOR KEY MILITARY FIGURES TO FORESTALL MORE </p><p>VIOLENCE.  SOUTH AFRICA IS UNABLE TO INFLUENCE MUGABE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02237  01 OF 03  261354Z </p><p>BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT MBEKI\'S JUNIOR POSITION, ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE FAILURE TO DO SO IS INVITING ECONOMIC DISASTER FOR </p><p>PRETORIA, THE MDC LEADER ASSERTED.  THE MDC SEEKS </p><p>CONTINUED U.S. INSISTENCE ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S RESPECT </p><p>FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE ESCALATING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE PRESIDENT (MDC), </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, ACCOMPANIED BY LOCAL BUSINESSMAN AND </p><p>MDC OFFICIAL CLIVE PUZEY, CALLED ON AMBASSADOR MCDONALD </p><p>ON APRIL 25 TO DISCUSS THE ESCALATING POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE.  IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS SUCH VIOLENCE HAS </p><p>GONE FROM PHYSICAL ATTACKS AND GENERAL INTIMIDATION OF </p><p>VOTERS, TO MURDERS OF BLACK FARM WORKERS, WHITE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS, AND OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS.  A TOTAL </p><p>OF FIVE MDC SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE TO DATE, MOST RECENTLY THREE BACKERS WERE </p><p>BEATEN TO DEATH IN HARARE, SHAMVA, AND ANOTHER PERI- </p><p>URBAN AREA, THE MDC LEADER INFORMED.  TSVANGIRAI </p><p>BELIEVES THE FARM VIOLENCE HAS BEEN ORCHESTRATED TO </p><p>SHIFT THE FOCUS FROM ZANU-PF\'S LIKELY ELECTORAL DEFEAT </p><p>TO THE EMOTIONAL LAND REFORM ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS TSVANGIRAI PREDICTS THE </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE WILL INCREASE.  HE STATED THAT THE </p><p>FEARED "FIFTH BRIGADE" ARMY MEMBERS, WHO WERE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE "GUKURUHUNDI" MASSACRES IN </p><p>MATABELELAND AND THE MIDLANDS IN THE EARLY 1980\'S, HAVE </p><p>AGAIN BEEN UNLEASHED ON THE CIVILIANS IN THOSE PARTS OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02237  01 OF 03  261354Z </p><p>THE COUNTRY, AND POSSIBLY ELSEWHERE.  PUZEY ENVISIONS A </p><p>RETURN TO THE DAYS WHEN THE COUNTRY LIVED IN TERROR </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE DEGREE AND SEVERITY OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p>THAT RESULTED IN "TRAINLOADS" OF VICTIMS BEING </p><p>TRANSPORTED FOR BURIALS BY THEIR FAMILIES.  THE VIOLENCE </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS ORGANIZING AND/OR CONDONING IS </p><p>DESIGNED TO CREATE TERROR, ERODE MDC SUPPORT AND ENSURE </p><p>THE RULING PARTY OF AN ELECTORAL VICTORY IN ITS </p><p>HISTORICALLY LOYAL RURAL AREAS WHOSE SUPPORT IS NOW IN </p><p>DOUBT.  IN SEPARATE MEETINGS, MDC SUPPORTERS HAVE </p><p>DOWNPLAYED THE LIKELIHOOD OF MUGABE DECLARING A "STATE </p><p>OF EMERGENCY," AS THE RULING PARTY\'S STRATEGY SEEMS MORE </p><p>FOCUSED ON GUARANTEEING AN ELECTORAL VICTORY TO </p><p></p></div>
