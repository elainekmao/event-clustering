<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001284 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL/C/LUNA AND BRANDOLINO </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PGOV, SNAR, PINR, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: Anti-Corruption Efforts in Nepal </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 90733, B) KATHMANDU 800, C) 01 KATHMANDU 843 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Ref A requested a brief summary of recent and </p><p>notable anti-corruption efforts in Nepal by the </p><p>government, civil society and the private sector. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Corruption is a serious and pervasive problem  in </p><p>Nepal, and is being recognized increasingly by both donors </p><p>and government leaders as a fundamental cause of the </p><p>current Maoist insurgency.  The Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>has begun to take tentative steps to address it, but many </p><p>of its initiatives have yet to be effectively implemented. </p><p>Presently Nepal\'s Finance Ministry is in the process of </p><p>drafting a new anti-corruption strategy. </p><p> </p><p>AG and CIAA Main Government Players </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Under Nepal\'s 1990 Constitution, two governmental </p><p>bodies are charged with investigating corruption: the </p><p>Auditor General and the Commission for the Investigation </p><p>of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).  Both face expanded </p><p>responsibilities and workloads without proportionate </p><p>increases in staffing or funding.  For example, a recent </p><p>Act of Parliament disbanded the national police force\'s </p><p>special anti-corruption unit, staffed by 100 officers. </p><p>Its responsibilities were shifted to the CIAA, which had </p><p>to take on the unit\'s duties without an increase in staff. </p><p>The CIAA has only 35 investigating officers. </p><p> </p><p>High-Level Investigation, but Still No Convictions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The CIAA\'s most-publicized case to date was a </p><p>bribery scandal related to the government\'s lease of a </p><p>passenger jet.  As part of its investigation, the CIAA in </p><p>May 2001 was able to question then-Prime Minister Gijira </p><p>Prasad Koirala about his role in affair (Ref C).  As a </p><p>result of the CIAA\'s work, the Executive Chairman of </p><p>Nepal\'s national airline was suspended from his post and </p><p>cases were brought against ten individuals.  Appeals </p><p>continue and as yet no one has been punished.  The CIAA </p><p>blames difficulties in proving white-collar crime and </p><p>unsympathetic judges for the fact that they lose nearly </p><p>all the cases they bring to court. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In recent months Nepal\'s media have focused on the </p><p>CIAA\'s investigation into the use of falsified </p><p>documentation to secure government employment.  The use of </p><p>fraudulently obtained graduation certificates and other </p><p>documents--many obtained from India--is widespread in </p><p>Nepal\'s bureaucracy. </p><p> </p><p>Multilateral Aid </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has taken the lead </p><p>in working with Nepal on anti-corruption initiatives.  The </p><p>ADB works primarily through the CIAA and the Ministry of </p><p>General Administration.  According to the ADB\'s Senior </p><p>Governance Officer, on-going anti-corruption and civil </p><p>service reform programs resulted in the passage of four </p><p>new anti-corruption acts during the last session of </p><p>Parliament (Ref B).  To date, few provisions of the new </p><p>act have taken effect, however.  An exception is a new </p><p>requirement that civil servants fill out asset disclosure </p><p>forms.  [Note:  Several government officials have </p><p>complained to us about having to fill out these forms, so </p><p>the requirement is being enforced and could have an impact </p><p>on corrupt practices.  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Bilateral Assistance </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The Danish aid agency, DANIDA, provides support and </p><p>technical assistance to CIAA.  The British development arm- </p><p>-DFID--funds a governance program with an anti-corruption </p><p>component.  Currently USAID does not have specific </p><p>programs targeted against corruption. </p><p> </p><p>Civil Society </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Transparency International and Pro-Public both </p><p>conduct anti-corruption awareness campaigns in Nepal.  In </p><p>addition, Pro-Public has worked closely with the CIAA to </p><p>improve its capacity. </p><p>International Pressure </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The public statement issued after the June 19-20 </p><p>meeting in London of major aid donors to Nepal welcomed </p><p>the expressed commitment of the Government of Nepal to </p><p>address, inter alia, the problem of corruption.  Although </p><p>much remains to be done to reduce corruption, the GON is </p><p>under growing pressure by the international community to </p><p>implement reforms to increase transparency, </p><p>accountability, and the rule of law. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
