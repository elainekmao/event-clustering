(S)  THE CURRENT OIL FOR FOOD (OFF) DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM </p><p>IN IRAQ DELIVERS FOOD TO ALL IRAQIS.  IN THE MONTH OF </p><p>NOVEMBER, 25.8 MILLION BENEFICIARIES RECEIVED A FOOD RATION </p><p>FROM 49,000 SMALL SHOPS THAT SERVE AS THE DISTRIBUTION </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06072  01 OF 04  191634Z </p><p>POINTS.  WHOLE-GRAIN WHEAT IS IMPORTED AND MILLED INTO FLOUR </p><p>INSIDE IRAQ.  THE U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) OVERSEES THE </p><p>DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE SOUTH/CENTRAL REGIONS AND PLAYS A MORE </p><p>INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE WHOLE PROCESS IN THE THREE NORTHERN </p><p>GOVERNORATES.  UNDER THE OFF PROGRAM, WFP DOES NOT TENDER FOR </p><p>THE PURCHASE OF ANY FOOD, CONTRACTS NO OUTSIDE TRANSPORT, AND </p><p>INSIDE IRAQ, CONTRACTS TRANSPORT ONLY FOR THE THREE NORTHERN </p><p>GOVERNORATES, WORKS WITH NO NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>(NGOS) FOR THE GENERAL DISTRIBUTION, DOES NOT ACTUALLY </p><p>CONDUCT ANY DISTRIBUTIONS--EVEN IN THE NORTH, AND DOES NOT </p><p>MANAGE THE FOOD PIPELINE.  ALL THESE FACTORS IMPACT WFP\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO GEAR UP QUICKLY IF THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ\'S (GOI) </p><p>ROLE IN THE OFF SYSTEM COLLAPSED.  WFP HAS VAST EXPERIENCE IN </p><p>ALL THESE AREAS, BUT IT WOULD TAKE TIME TO MOUNT SUCH AN </p><p>OPERATION.  THE INITIAL WFP RATION, TARGETED TO THE MOST </p><p>VULNERABLE, WOULD CONSIST OF ITS STANDARD EMERGENCY RATION, </p><p>WHICH IS LESS DIVERSE THAN THE CURRENT OFF RATION.

(U) THE CONTRACTS FOR ALL COMMODITIES ARE TENDERED AND </p><p>PURCHASED BY THE GOI, AFTER HAVING BEEN APPROVED BY THE </p><p>OFFICE OF THE IRAQ PROGRAM (OIP).  ALL COMMODITIES ARE </p><p>IMPORTED.  THE GOI ARRANGES FOR THE TRANSPORT OF ALL </p><p>COMMODITIES OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY TO THE LARGE TRANSIT </p><p>WAREHOUSES INSIDE IRAQ.  FROM THE TRANSIT WAREHOUSES, THE </p><p>COMMODITIES ARE TAKEN TO THE VARIOUS GOVERNORATES\' </p><p>WAREHOUSES, I.E., THE EXTENDED DELIVERY POINTS (EDPS).

(U) IN THE NORTH, THE PROCEDURE IS VERY SIMILAR.  THE </p><p>COMMODITIES ARE DELIVERED TO WFP-MANAGED TRANSIT WAREHOUSES </p><p>IN MOSUL AND KIRKUK.  MOSUL AND KIRKUK ARE LOCATED IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL REGION BUT CLOSE TO THE BORDER WITH THE NORTHERN </p><p>GOVERNORATES.  WFP, WORKING WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE </p><p>THREE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES, CALLS FORWARD THE FOOD TO THE </p><p>THREE EDP WAREHOUSES IN THE NORTH LOCATED IN SULAYMANIYAH, </p><p>DAHUK, AND ARBIL.  FROM THERE, THE COMMODITIES ARE </p><p>TRANS-SHIPPED ONTO SHORT-HAUL TRUCKS AND DELIVERED TO THE </p><p>FOOD AGENTS (SMALL SHOPS) FOR FINAL DISTRIBUTION.  WFP </p><p>CONTRACTS THE TRUCKING IN THE NORTH FOR THE EDP AND FOOD </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06072  02 OF 04  191634Z </p><p>AGENT DELIVERIES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) ALL WHEAT IS IMPORTED AS WHOLE-GRAIN WHEAT AND IS </p><p>MILLED INTO FLOUR INSIDE IRAQ BEFORE BEING TRANSPORTED TO </p><p>WAREHOUSES.  THERE ARE AT LEAST ONE TO TWO MILLS IN EACH </p><p>GOVERNORATE, AS WELL AS A VERY LARGE ONE IN PORT UMM QASR. </p><p>SOME OF THE BIGGER MILLS ARE ABLE TO MILL 500-600 MT PER DAY. </p><p> ALL WHEAT DESTINED FOR THE NORTH IS MILLED IN THE </p><p>SOUTHERN/CENTRAL REGIONS.  (NOTE:  THERE ARE MILLS IN THE </p><p>NORTH, HOWEVER THEY WOULD NEED TO BE REPAIRED BEFORE BECOMING </p><p>OPERATIONAL.  END NOTE.)  THE MILLS EITHER OPERATE ON </p><p>ELECTRICITY OR VIA GENERATOR.  SILOS, AND SOMETIMES ALSO </p><p>WAREHOUSES, ARE SITUATED WITH THE MILLS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) THE TOTAL TONNAGE DISTRIBUTED PER MONTH IN THE NORTH </p><p>IS 50,000-60,000 MT PER MONTH AND IN THE SOUTH/CENTRAL </p><p>REGIONS IS 400,000-420,000 MT PER MONTH.  SINCE THE PROGRAM </p><p>BEGAN, A MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION HAS NEVER BEEN MISSED. </p><p>SOMETIMES ONE OR TWO COMMODITIES MAY BE ABSENT, BUT THEY ARE </p><p>PROVIDED RETROACTIVELY IN A SUBSEQUENT DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>BENEFICIARY LISTS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, THE DISTRIBUTION IS DONE VIA </p><p>SMALL SHOPS BY THE FOOD AGENTS.  THE FOOD AGENT RECEIVES EACH </p><p>MONTH THE LIST OF BENEFICIARIES.  FOR THE CENTRAL/SOUTH, THE </p><p>GOI MAINTAINS THE DATABASE OF BENEFICIARIES; IN THE NORTH, </p><p>WFP MAINTAINS THE DATABASE.  EACH BENEFICIARY RECEIVES A </p><p>RATION CARD THAT IS PRINTED BY THE GOI, HOWEVER IN THE NORTH </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06072  02 OF 04  191634Z </p><p>THE NAMES OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE PUT ON THE CARDS BY WFP. </p><p>THE FOOD AGENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING RECORDS OF RECEIPT </p><p>FOR EACH MONTH\'S DISTRIBUTION, AND HE IS REQUIRED TO SEND IN </p><p>THE REPORT TO THE GOI.  IF SOMEONE MOVES, HE/SHE MUST BE </p><p>TAKEN OFF ONE LIST BEFORE BEING ADDED TO A NEW LIST.  IF A </p><p>BABY IS BORN, ONE MUST FILL OUT THE APPROPRIATE PAPERWORK TO </p><p>ADD A NEW FAMILY MEMBER.  IT IS THE FOOD AGENT\'S </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW HIS BENEFICIARIES, WHICH ON AVERAGE </p><p>TOTAL 150 FAMILIES PER FOOD AGENT.  BENEFICIARIES PAY </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 0.12 USD FOR THE MONTHLY RATION.  (AVERAGE </p><p>INCOME IS ABOUT 3 USD PER MONTH.)  IN THE SOUTH/CENTRAL </p><p>REGIONS, WFP MONITORS THE DISTRIBUTION ONLY. </p><p> </p><p>   8.  (U) THE SAME DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM EXISTS IN THE NORTH, </p><p>BUT WFP PLAYS A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN THE ENTIRE PROCESS.  WFP </p><p>MAINTAINS THE DATABASE, THUS THE FOOD AGENTS RECEIVE THEIR </p><p>MONTHLY LISTS FROM WFP, HOWEVER THE LOCAL GOVERNORATES </p><p>ADMINISTRATION IS INVOLVED.  THE GOI ALSO RECEIVES REPORTS </p><p>REGARDING THE DISTRIBUTIONS SINCE IT HANDLES THE PROCUREMENT. </p><p> ALSO IN THE NORTH, WFP CONDUCTS POST-DISTRIBUTION MONITORING </p><p>(PDM) IN COORDINATION WITH A GOVERNORATE REPRESENTATIVE.

(U) CURRENTLY, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 49,000 SEPARATE </p><p>SHOPS THAT SERVE AS FOOD DISTRIBUTION AGENTS.  IN SOME TOWNS </p><p>OR NEIGHBORHOODS, THE DISTRIBUTION OF WHEAT FLOUR IS DONE </p><p>FROM A SEPARATE SHOP THAN THE OTHER COMMODITIES, SO A </p><p>BENEFICIARY MUST GO TO TWO SHOPS FOR THE RATION.

(S) WFP HAS PARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS IF IT WERE TO TAKE </p><p>OVER TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS INSIDE </p><p>COUNTRY--EVEN IF THE BENEFICIARY NUMBERS WERE LOWER.  UNDER </p><p>THE CURRENT OFF OPERATION, WFP DOES NO/NO TENDERING FOR FOOD </p><p>PURCHASES, CONTRACTS NO/NO OUTSIDE TRANSPORT AND INSIDE IRAQ, </p><p>CONTRACTS TRANSPORT ONLY FOR THE THREE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES, </p><p>WORKS WITH NO/NO NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) FOR </p><p>THE GENERAL DISTRIBUTION, DOES NOT ACTUALLY DO ANY </p><p>DISTRIBUTIONS--EVEN IN THE NORTH, AND DOES NOT MANAGE THE </p><p>FOOD PIPELINE.

EVEN THOUGH WFP </p><p>HAS VAST EXPERIENCE IN ALL THESE AREAS, NONE OF THEM CAN BE </p><p>ACHIEVED OVERNIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>12.
