The consultation process </p><p>will begin with a three-way `summit\' including the PM, the </p><p>Chief of General Staff and the President.  "Hurriyet" </p><p>reports that FM Gul stressed the necessity of a </p><p>parliamentary motion for the troop deployment, and said that </p><p>the government has decided to send a motion to parliament </p><p>`without rushing\' and after informing the public about the </p><p>issue.   "Milliyet" Washington Correspondent Yasemin Congar </p><p>draws attention to three formulas considered by the US to </p><p>facilitate a Turkish decision for sending troops to Iraq. </p><p>One alternative is to ensure NATO support for the </p><p>stabilization force.  A second alternative is based on the </p><p>`Polish formula,\' which guarantees NATO logistical support </p><p>for Turkish troops.  A third formula is an invitation to </p><p>Turkish troops by the interim Iraqi council.  "Sabah" </p><p>reports the US State Department announcement listing the 30 </p><p>countries that have agreed to send troops to Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Joint Exercise Confusion: "Milliyet" cites conflicting </p><p>reports regarding joint exercises by the US and Turkey near </p><p>the Turkish-Iraqi border.  Although no denial has come from </p><p>FM Gul or the TGS, Barzani\'s special forces commander Aziz </p><p>Veysi stated that the joint exercises in Northern Iraq were </p><p>in fact carried out by US and Kurdish troops.  Veysi </p><p>insisted that the conflicting reports stemmed from the AP </p><p>correspondent\'s mixing up of the words `Turkish\' and </p><p>`Kurdish.\'  According to Veysi, no Turkish troops </p><p>participated in  the exercises. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Standard & Poors:  "Hurriyet" reports that the international </p><p>credit rating institution Standard & Poors has upgraded </p><p>Turkey\'s credit rating from `B minus\' to `B.\'  While </p><p>upgrading Turkey\'s rating, S&P sent a message to the AKP </p><p>urging the Government not to engage in an `election economy\' </p><p>that could increase Turkey\'s debt problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Democratic messages" </p><p>Cengiz Candar argued in the mass appeal DB-Tercuman (7/29): </p><p>"Gul\'s message for `civilianizing\' politics in Turkey will </p><p>undoubtedly find support in the Pentagon, the main </p><p>administrative institution of U.S. politics. .  Gul has made </p><p>it clear that Turkish troops will leave Northern Iraq if the </p><p>PKK/KADEK presence is eliminated.  He also stressed that the </p><p>Northern Iraq issue will be taken away from the TGS and put </p><p>under the authority of the civilian government. .  Adopting </p><p>Gul\'s pledges in Washington as a government policy will </p><p>serve the democratization agenda of the AKP. .  It is ironic </p><p>that the leadership of the `social democratic\' CHP is </p><p>opposing this attempt to civilianize politics in Turkey. . </p><p>CHP is increasingly going back to the days when it was </p><p>defined as a `party of the state.\' .  Not only the </p><p>Americans, but those with a democratic sensitivity in </p><p>Turkey, are increasingly adopting a negative view of the </p><p>CHP." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What\'s changed in the view of the Americans?" </p><p>Sedat Ergin wrote in the mass appeal Hurriyet (7/29): "U.S. </p><p>officials are gradually realizing that staying at odds with </p><p>Turkey will not serve their interest.  Hawks like Rumsfeld </p><p>have started moving closer to Powell, who has made a </p><p>considerable effort to prevent a break in ties.  The United </p><p>States, determined to wipe out the terrorist threat after </p><p>9/11, cannot push Turkey aside. .  Although a bit too late, </p><p>the Washington Administration realized that it had gone too </p><p>far in the Suleymaniye event.  Washington had to open its </p><p>eyes to the growing anti-American sentiment in Turkey.  The </p><p>Gul visit has shown that the U.S. has acknowledged that its </p><p>long-term interests will not allow the break in ties with </p><p>Turkey to continue.  The same is true from the AKP view of </p><p>Washington.  Despite all the negativity that has been </p><p>experienced, the sides saw that they have no other option </p><p>but to hold each other\'s hand and move forward." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
