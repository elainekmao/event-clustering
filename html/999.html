PREL, TS </p><p>SUBJECT:  BEN ALI SUCCESSION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 68334 </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSAD0R R0BIN L. RAPHEL BASED 0N 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>SUMMARY AND C0MMENT </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  IMMEDIATE SUCCESSI0N ISSUES ARE LESS 0F A C0NCERN IN </p><p>TUNISIA THAN S0ME 0THER C0UNTRIES IN THE REGI0N.  GIVEN HIS </p><p>R0BUST HEALTH, THE 62-YEAR-0LD BEN ALI IS EXPECTED ALC (##)F0URTH </p><p>TERM OF OFFICE UNTIL WELL INT0 HIS THIRD.  IN THE CASE </p><p>0F THE DEATH 0R INCAPACITATI0N 0F BEN ALI, THE C0NSTITUTI0N </p><p>CALLS F0R THE PRESIDENT 0F THE CHAMBER 0F DEPUTIES T0 BE </p><p>APP0INTED AS A INTERIM PRESIDENT WITH LIMITED P0WERS UNTIL NEW </p><p>ELECTI0NS CAN BE SCHEDULED.  THIS W0ULD PR0BABLY BE F0LL0WED </p><p>SCRUPUL0USLY, GIVEN RULING PARTY DISCIPLINE AND L0YALTY AND </p><p>TUNISIA\'S LARGELY AP0LITICAL. H0M0GENE0US P0PULATI0N.  WHILE </p><p>RULING PA"QM[BW9VQB THAT THE LACKLUSTER </p><p>OPPOSITION FIGURES WOULD POSE ANY SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO THE </p><p>POWERFUL (AND POPULAR) RCD PARTY MACHINE.  MOREOVER, THE ONCE </p><p>STRONG ISLAMIC MOVEMENT REMAINS TOO WEAK TO THREATEN AN </p><p>RCD-ANNOINTED SUCCESSOR TO BEN ALI IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  THE </p><p>MILITARY DOES NOT PLAY AN INDEPENDENT POLITICAL ROLE.  IN </p><p>SHORT, WE DO NOT SEE SUCCESSION POSING ANY SERIOUS THREAT TO </p><p>TUNISIA\'S INTERNAL STABILITY OR ITS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE </p><p>UNITED STATES.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>BEN ALI:  IN VIGOROUS HEALTH, </p><p>HE CAN SERVE OUT A NEW FIVE-YEAR TERM -- AND BEYOND? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>REPORTEDLY DYING, PREDECESSOR.  ALL EXPECTATIONS ARE THAT BEN </p><p>ALI, UP FOR RE-ELECTION ON OCTOBER 24, WILL BE ABLE TO SERVE </p><p>OUT HIS THIRD FIVE-YEAR TERM AS PRESIDENT.  (BEN ALI HAS BEEN </p><p>IN OFFICE SINCE NOVEMBER 1987, BUT IN THE PERIOD BEFORE 1989 </p><p>ELECTIONS HE WAS FINISHING OUT BOURGUIBA\'S FINAL TERM.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CURRENT HEALTH CONSTRAINTS </p><p>WHICH WOULD PREVENT HIM FROM SERVING WELL BEYOND THAT TERM\'S </p><p>EXPIRATION IN 2004, ALTHOUGH A FOURTH TERM WOULD REQUIRE A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.  THIS WOULD NOT LIKELY BE AN OBSTACLE, </p><p>AS BEN ALI\'S RULING RCD PARTY WILL CONTROL ENOUGH SEATS IN THE </p><p>CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AFTER THE OCTOBER 1999 ELECTIONS TO AMEND </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW BEN ALI TO RUN AGAIN, OR HE COULD USE </p><p>A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION ALLOWING PLEBISCITES FOR ISSUES </p><p>OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE TO ARRANGE FOR "POPULAR DEMAND."  BUT </p><p>WELL-INFORMED TUNISIANS ARE DIVIDED OVER WHETHER, IN FACT, BEN </p><p>ALI WOULD WANT A FOURTH TERM IN OFFICE, AND HE HIMSELF MAY NOT </p><p>BE SURE.  GIVEN HIS CAUTIOUS TEMPERAMENT AND DESIRE TO WEIGH </p><p>ALL MAJOR DECISIONS CAREFULLY, TOGETHER WITH HIS CONCERN NOT TO </p><p>BECOME A "LAME DUCK" PREMATURELY, THE ODDS ARE THAT BEN ALI </p><p>WILL NOT REVEAL HIS HAND UNTIL WELL INTO HIS NEXT TERM OF </p><p>OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>LEGAL MECHANISMS FOR SUCCESSION IN PLACE: </p><p>WEAK INTERIM PRESIDENT TO OVERSEE ELECTIONS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  IF THE TUNISIAN PRESIDENT DIES IN OFFICE OR IS SUBJECT </p><p>TO TOTAL INCAPACITATION ("EMPECHEMENT ABSOLU"), ARTICLE 57 OF </p><p>THE TUNISIAN CONSTITUTION STIPULATES THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES WILL ASSUME THE FUNCTIONS OF PRESIDENT "PAR </p><p>INTERIM" FOR A PERIOD WHICH MAY VARY BETWEEN 45 AND 60 DAYS.  A </p><p>POSITION WEAK BY DESIGN, THE INTERIM PRESIDENT IS RESTRICTED </p><p>FROM PERFORMING SOME FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS DISSOLVING PARLIAMENT, </p><p>CALLING FOR REFERENDUMS, OR DISMISSING THE GOVERNMENT.  THE </p><p>INTERIM PRESIDENT IS TO OVERSEE ELECTIONS WHICH WILL ELECT THE </p><p>NEW PRESIDENT FOR A FULL FIVE-YEAR MANDATE.  EVEN IF THE </p><p>INTERIM PRESIDENT RESIGNS, HE IS NOT PERMITTED TO RUN IN THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  BEFORE THIS SUCCESSION ARRANGEMENT WAS INSTITUTED VIA </p><p>A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON JULY 25, 1988, THE TUNISIAN </p><p>CONSTITUTION STIPULATED THAT ALL POWERS AND DUTIES WOULD </p><p>DEVOLVE TO THE PRIME MINISTER IN THE CASE OF DEATH OF </p><p>INCAPACITATION OF THE PRESIDENT, AND THAT THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>WOULD SERVE AS PRESIDENT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>TERM.  THIS CLAUSE WAS INVOKED ON NOVEMBER 7, 1987, WHEN </p><p>THEN-PRIME MINISTER BEN ALI NUDGED ASIDE BOURGUIBA, WHO WAS </p><p>DECLARED BY DOCTORS AS MENTALLY UNFIT TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE, IN </p><p>THE BLOODLESS COUP NOW KNOWN IN ARABIC AS "THE BLESSED </p><p>CHANGE." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  IN THE EVENT OF THE DEATH OR INCAPACITATION OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS </p><p>EXPLAINED ABOVE WOULD BE SCRUPULOUSLY FOLLOWED, AS WOULD </p><p>PROVISIONS FOR ELECTIONS SHOULD BEN ALI STEP DOWN IN 2004, AS </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES.  ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THERE WILL BE </p><p>ELECTIONS, AND THE RCD-ANNOINTED CANDIDATE WILL LIKELY WIN </p><p>(EVEN IF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN PERIOD AND ELECTIONS PASSED OUR </p><p>MOST RIGOROUS TEST OF "FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS"):  THE RULING </p><p>RCD PARTY AND MILITARY/POLICE ARE VERY WELL DISCIPLINED AND </p><p>DEV0TED T0 THE CURRENT STRUCTURE AND ARE LIKELY T0 F0CUS 0N A </p><p>SINGLE CANDIDATE RATHER THAN SPLINTERING INT0 RIVAL GR0UPS. </p><p>THE PARTY REMAINS P0PULAR, AS M0ST TUNISIANS CREDIT IT F0R </p><p>BRINGING PR0SPERITY AND STABILTY.  (A SHARP RISE IN </p><p>UNEMPL0YMENT 0R SERI0US EC0N0MIC RECESSI0N C0ULD CHANGE THE </p><p>F0RMULA, BUT S0 FAR EC0N0MIC GR0WTH REMAINS S0LID.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  M0RE0VER, THE GENERALLY AP0LITICAL TUNISIAN P0PULATI0N </p><p>IS H0M0GENE0US AND FREE 0F ETHNIC/RELIGI0US/TRIBAL DIFFERENCES </p><p>WHICH IN S0ME C0UNTRIES HAS LED T0 M0RE LIVELY P0LITICS 0R </p><p>D0MESTIC INSTABILITY.  THE 0NCE STR0NG ISLAMIC 0PP0SITI0N IS </p><p>WEAK, ITS LEADERS EXILED 0R IN PRIS0N, AND IN N0 P0SITI0N T0 </p><p>TAKE ADVANTAGE 0F A SUCCESSI0N.  THE LEGAL 0PP0SITI0N PARTIES </p><p>WILL INCREASE THEIR PRESENCE IN THE CHAMBER 0F DEPUTIES AFTER </p><p>0CT0BER ELECTI0NS BECAUSE 0F A C0NSTITUTI0N CHANGE INITIATED BY </p><p>BEN ALI T0 RESERVE 20 PERCENT 0F CHAMBER SEATS F0R 0PP0SITI0N </p><p>PARTIES.  H0WEVER, THEY ARE IN N0 P0SITI0N T0 WIN THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY IN ELECTI0NS AGAINST THE WELL 0RGANIZED AND P0PULAR </p><p>RCD -- N0R D0 THEY HAVE THE ABILITY T0 SEIZE THE REINS 0F </p><p>G0VERNMENT BY F0RCE.  IN SH0RT, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A SUDDENLY </p><p>VACATED PRESIDENCY W0ULD LEAD T0 CHA0S, BECAUSE THERE IS N0 </p><p>APPARENT BASIS F0R`KL[_QUAN 0BVI0US SUCCESS0R BY NAME. IN FACT, </p><p>FOR RCD (##)G0T 0FFICIALS T0 ACCUMULATE T00 MUCH P0WER IN THEIR </p><p>HANDS IS N0T A CAREER-ENHANCING M0VE:MANY PE0PLE THINK THAT THE </p><p>RECENT REM0VAL 0F FINANCE MINISTER JERI AND ENVIR0NMENT MINISTER </p><p>STEMMED AT LEAST IN PART FR0M THEIR INDEPENDENT P0WER BASES (AS </p><p>MLIKA WELL AS PLAUSIBLE ALLEGATI0NS 0F C0RRUPTI0N).  INDEED, AM0NG </p><p>THE CURRENT CR0P 0F G0T MINISTERS, M0ST ARE TECHN0CRATS WH0 </p><p>R0SE THR0UGH THE BUREAUCRACY AND N0T P0LITICIANS WITH P0WER AND </p><p>P0PULARITY IN THEIR 0WN RIGHT.  JUSTICE MINISTER KALLEL, 0NCE </p><p>AN EXTREMELY CL0SE C0NFIDANT T0 BEN ALI, WAS RUM0RED T0 HAVE </p><p>BEC0ME S0 STR0NG IN HIS PREVI0US P0SITI0N AS AN ADVIS0R T0 THE </p><p>PRESIDENT THAT HE WAS "SIDELINED" T0 A MINISTRY WHERE HIS </p><p>RESP0NSIBILITIES WERE M0RE NARR0WLY DRAWN.  THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>IS A MUCH WEAKER P0SITI0N THAN IT WAS WHEN BEN ALI WAS IN THAT </p><p>0FFICE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  TODAY, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORS MOHAMED JEGHAM AND </p><p>ABDELWAHEB ABDALLAH ARE PERHAPS THE MOST POWERFUL IN BEN ALI\'S </p><p>IMMEDIATE CIRCLE, BUT THEY, TOO, DERIVE THEIR POWER FROM BEN </p><p>ALI AND DO NOT ENJOY THE SORT OF INDEPENDENT POWER BASE WHICH </p><p>BEN ALI HAD BEFORE THE NOVEMBER 7, 1987 COUP.  OF THE </p><p>MINISTERS, MINISTER OF DEFENSE HABIB BEN YAHIA HAS SUCCEEDED IN </p><p>PLACING PROTEGES AS BOTH MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND HEAD </p><p>OF THE RCD, BUT HE IS A CAREER DIPLOMAT, NOT A POLITICIAN. </p><p>MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT FAIZA KEFI IS ONE OF THE MOST </p><p>AMBITIOUS, SAVVY POLITICIANS WE KNOW, BUT TUNISIA, FOR ALL ITS </p><p>PROGRESSIVE POLICIES, IS NOT READY FOR A WOMAN PRESIDENT. </p><p>WHILE MRS. BEN ALI HAS MANAGED TO INSERT CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS </p><p>INTO INFLUENTIAL POSITIONS. THE RESULTING CORRUPTION, TOLERATED </p><p>WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS BY BEN ALI, HAS LED TO REVULSION AMONG </p><p>MANY TUNISIANS.  THEREFORE, WE STRONGLY DOUBT ANY OF HER </p><p>RELATIVES WOULD GET THE BLESSING OF THE RCD LEADERSHIP TO </p><p>SUCCEED BEN ALI. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>NO SERIOUS THREAT TO U.S. INTERESTS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO OBVIOUS HEIR </p><p>APPARENT WHO WOULD SERVE AS AN RCD CANDIDATE IN SUCCESSION </p><p>ELECTIONS, WE DO NOT ENVISION A SERIOUS THREAT TO U.S. </p><p>INTERESTS IN TUNISIA\'S EVENTUAL TRANSITION FROM THE BEN ALI </p><p>ERA.  TUNISIANS ARE GENERALLY PLEASED WITH THE DIRECTION OF </p><p>THEIR COUNTRY, AND ANY FORSEEABLE SUCCESSOR TO BEN ALI CAN </p><p>EXPECT TO FACE STRONG RESISTANCE FROM BOTH ELITES AND THE </p><p>GENERAL PUBLIC TO ANY ATTEMPT TO DEVIATE FROM TUNISIA\'S </p><p>MODERATE POLICIES AND ITS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED </p><p>STATES AND EUROPE.  WHAT WE HOPE TO SEE BY THE TIME OF ANY </p><p>SUCCESSION IS A BROADER AND DEEPER DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  WE </p><p>SHOULD CONTINUE TO USE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE THE GOT </p><p>TO EXPAND PLURALISM AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND PRESS, IN </p><p>ORDER TO GIVE THE GENERALLY MODERATE AND PRO-WESTERN TUNISIAN </p><p>CITIZENS THE OPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN, AND REINFORCE, A </p><p>SMOOTH SUCCESSION OF POWER THAT REFLECTS DEMOCRATIC NORMS. </p><p> </p><p>RAPHEL </p><p></p></div>
