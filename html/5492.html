<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/04/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAGR, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOZ OVERTURES TO COMMERCIAL FARMERS:  "WHITEWASH" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Laboff KRBel for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  Recent conversations with Commercial </p><p>Farmers\' Union (CFU) President Colin Cloete indicate that GOZ </p><p>overtures to remaining white farmers constitute "whitewash" </p><p>and meaningless window-dressing.  Commercial farms continue </p><p>to receive final notices of compulsory acquisition, despite </p><p>public assertions that "the land resettlement program is now </p><p>complete," and that farmers with standing crops would not be </p><p>ousted.  No concessions have been made to commercial farmers, </p><p>and no credible offers have been made to return commercial </p><p>farmers to the land.  Minister of Lands, Agriculture and </p><p>Resettlement Joseph Made\'s key goal appears to be securing </p><p>public support from Zimbabwe\'s white farmers in increasing </p><p>pressure on Great Britain toward two goals: funding </p><p>compensation schemes and reducing international censure of </p><p>Zimbabwe.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Minister of Lands Initiates Contact </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  After a total communications freeze-out between the </p><p>commercial farmers and the GOZ, Made has initiated all recent </p><p>meetings, which have been widely publicized in the </p><p>GOZ-controlled press.   During the first ice-breaking January </p><p>meeting, Made urged Cloete to "release" farming equipment -- </p><p>some of which has been warehoused by farmers hoping to return </p><p>to their livelihood -- to the resettled farmers.  Cloete </p><p>demurred, pointing out that the equipment in question was </p><p>private property belonging to individuals rather than the </p><p>CFU, and noting that most farmers were hoping to return to </p><p>their property under the one-man, one-farm policy.  Made was </p><p>dismissive of the pointed reference to the GOZ\'s failure to </p><p>implement that policy, stating "That\'s an interesting point," </p><p>as he quickly changed the subject. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Key GOZ Concern is for CFU "Statement" of Solidarity </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Made soon revealed his hidden agenda.  Made insisted </p><p>to Cloete that Great Britain must be made to accept its </p><p>responsibility to pay for the land reform program at any </p><p>cost.  Made stated that he wanted the CFU to "put a team </p><p>together" in order to state its support of the GOZ\'s land </p><p>reform program, its condemnation for the British refusal to </p><p>pay compensation, and its willingness to engage other </p><p>governments to build international pressure against Britain\'s </p><p>"demonisation" of Zimbabwe. Cloete was noncommital regarding </p><p>this demand, stating that he was not free to make such a </p><p>commitment without consulting the CFU Council.  Made urged </p><p>Cloete to obtain the support of the Council and to generate a </p><p>publicly supportive statement as quickly as possible. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Cloete was subsequently summoned to a Ministerial </p><p>meeting set for the following week.  On Monday, January 27, </p><p>Cloete met with a group of eight ministers which included </p><p>many of President Mugabe\'s inner circle, including Made, </p><p>Patrick Chinamasa, Joyce Mujuru, Ignatius Chombo, Elliot </p><p>Manyika, and Jonathan Moyo.  Minister of Justice Chinamasa </p><p>insisted that the CFU make a public statement supporting the </p><p>GOZ\'s efforts to force the British to fund compensation for </p><p>the land program.  Cloete responded that the CFU had </p><p>discussed approaching several international donors in support </p><p>of funding a neutral compensation program; Chinamasa replied </p><p>that he didn\'t personally care where the money came from, but </p><p>insisted that the CFU must assist in "de-vilifying" Zimbabwe. </p><p> Chinamasa\'s message was that the farmers have helped </p><p>"demonise" the GOZ, they must now help remove the </p><p>international pressure from the GOZ.  Again, Cloete stated </p><p>that he  would have to consult with the CFU Council. </p><p>Jonathan Moyo continued to push the point, asking, "Will you </p><p>make a statement after that meeting?"  Cloete responded that </p><p>he would advise the ministers of the results of CFU Council </p><p>discussions. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Meeting with South African Minister of Lands </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Made\'s office once again contacted Cloete on </p><p>Wednesday in order to secure his attendance at a meeting </p><p>between Made and the South African Minister of Lands.  Cloete </p><p>was unable to confirm attendance due to a court date </p><p>scheduled for the same day, in which the GOZ was pressing </p><p>charges that he had failed to comply with the Section 8 </p><p>acquisition notice whereby he was ordered to vacate his farm. </p><p> However, after backroom negotiation and several phone calls </p><p>from Made and Jonathan Moyo, Cloete was advised to confer on </p><p>Thursday morning with an assistant prosecutor at the court in </p><p>Norton, where his case was pending.  On Thursday, five </p><p>commercial farmers facing identical charges -- including </p><p>Cloete -- were advised that the GOZ had withdrawn the charges </p><p>of failing to comply with Section 8  acquisition orders. </p><p>Interestingly, the GOZ withdrew only the charges of "failing </p><p>to comply" with the acquisition orders, and not the </p><p>acquisition orders themselves.  In any event, this fortuitous </p><p>holding left Cloete free to meet with Minister Made and the </p><p>SA Minister of Lands as scheduled.  Cloete\'s most poignant </p><p>recollection of that meeting concerned the discussion of the </p><p>humanitarian and agricultural crisis.  According to Cloete, </p><p>Made stated to his counterpart, "In Africa, our people are </p><p>used to hunger and starvation.... we will sit under a tree </p><p>and wait until this passes." </p><p>6. (C)  Cloete\'s perception, based on that meeting and other </p><p>information, is that South Africa is "heavily involved" in </p><p>trying to reduce the international pressure against Zimbabwe. </p><p> According to Cloete, the SA High Commissioner (on Mbeki\'s </p><p>personal orders) has met with all of the Presidents of the </p><p>agricultural unions -- Cloete of the CFU, Silas Hungwe of the </p><p>Zimbabwe Farmers\' Union (ZFU) and David Mugabe of the </p><p>Indigenous Commercial Farmers\' Union (ICFU) -- during the </p><p>past few weeks.  Cloete believes that Mbeki is trying to </p><p>build support for the GOZ in advance of the upcoming </p><p>Commonwealth Troika meeting on expulsion of Zimbabwe, as well </p><p>as the ongoing EU meetings to consider renewal of sanctions </p><p>against Zimbabwean ministers. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Still No Concessions to Commercial Farmers </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Despite the urgency of the GOZ\'s requests, it has </p><p>offered no concessions to commercial farmers.  According to </p><p>Cloete, no CFU member has had his property officially </p><p>de-listed, no settlers have been removed from occupied </p><p>property, and no farmer has been returned to his farm as a </p><p>result of the GOZ\'s publicity campaign.  In fact, the GOZ </p><p>continues to gazette new properties for compulsory </p><p>acquisition, and has done nothing to protect farmers facing </p><p>extra-legal attempts to evict them.  Up to eighteen farms and </p><p>conservancies in the Midland region, including one owned by </p><p>an Amcit couple (reftel), received new Section 8 notices over </p><p>the weekend of January 25.  The situation of the commercial </p><p>sugar cane farms in the lowveldt -- in which over 70% of </p><p>privately-held properties have been turned over to A2 </p><p>indigenous Zanu-PF beneficiaries -- serves to highlight the </p><p>fallacy of GOZ claims that "farmers with standing crops will </p><p>not be disturbed."  Additionally, the dairy farms, which have </p><p>largely been left untouched during the land resettlement </p><p>process, are coming under increased pressure.  Ian Webster, a </p><p>dairy farmer with a herd of 1,000 dairy cattle and who </p><p>produces 40% of Harare\'s milk, has reportedly been forced by </p><p>Made to take an ARDA trainee into his operation.  According </p><p>to Cloete, once the ARDA trainee is capable of running the </p><p>dairy farm, Made plans to seize the farm and turn it over to </p><p>President Robert Mugabe -- who has not yet claimed a farm in </p><p>his own name -- as a "present" from the grateful people of </p><p>Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  One of Cloete\'s impressions from this series of </p><p>meetings is that sanctions are having a biting effect on </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s elite.  The message being broadcast to the CFU, </p><p>over and over again, is that they must assist the GOZ in </p><p>removing the sanctions and decreasing the international </p><p>censure of Zimbabwe\'s government.  Cloete also believes that </p><p>the GOZ is extremely "touchy" about increased US attention to </p><p>the situation in Zimbabwe.  According to Cloete, the </p><p>ministers with whom he spoke believe that "the British are </p><p>great talkers, but the Americans mean action."  Cloete </p><p>reported that every time the US is mentioned -- for instance, </p><p>when the CFU broached the idea about approaching a broader </p><p>group of donors on the question of compensation -- GOZ </p><p>representatives respond with clear uneasiness and discomfort. </p><p> Perhaps this is an indication of the impact of USG </p><p>sanctions; in any event, Cloete believes this to be an </p><p>indication that the threat of USG action still resonates with </p><p>those in power.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
