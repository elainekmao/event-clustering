<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000381 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; EAP/RSP; S/CT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, VM, ARF, ASEAN, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT:  POSITIVE ON ASEAN COUNTERTERRORISM INITIATIVES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Hanoi 1947 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs ASEAN </p><p>Department (MFA/ASEAN) expert Nguyen Thanh Huy, the GVN "is </p><p>fully committed" to the international struggle against </p><p>terrorism and will accede to ASEAN\'s "Agreement on </p><p>Information Exchange and Establishment of Communication </p><p>Procedures" signed last May by Indonesia, Malaysia, and the </p><p>Philippines.  "It is only a matter of time" until Vietnam </p><p>accedes, he claimed, while declining to predict exactly </p><p>when.  He added that deliberations within the GVN leadership </p><p>are "nearing completion," however. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Huy praised the three-day security conference held </p><p>in January in Manila at which the Philippines, Cambodia, </p><p>Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand agreed to form a joint </p><p>committee to boost multilateral cooperation against </p><p>terrorism and "other transnational crimes."  Huy also </p><p>pointed to a January police conference in Indonesia, </p><p>attended by GVN Ministry of Public Security Director General </p><p>Major General Truong Huu Quoc, at which officials pledged to </p><p>strengthen counterterrorism cooperation and establish </p><p>special counterterrorism task forces in ASEAN member </p><p>countries.  Vietnam "is looking forward" to hosting the </p><p>third annual senior conference on transnational crime, </p><p>scheduled for June 2003 in Hanoi, he added. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Huy claimed that, while the GVN leadership believes </p><p>Vietnam is a less likely terrorist target than some other </p><p>ASEAN members, events such as September 11 and Bali have </p><p>clearly demonstrated that the terrorist forces "have a long </p><p>reach." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  COMMENT.  Huy is a focal point for </p><p>counterterroism issues within MFA/ASEAN (and, as a result, </p><p>we are considering him as a potential IV grantee).  We </p><p>understand that he has written extensively on ASEAN </p><p>counterterrorism initiatives within the MFA.  It is </p><p>encouraging that such helpful views regarding the </p><p>seriousness of the war on terrorism and the imperative of </p><p>regional cooperation appear to be circulating among the </p><p>leadership. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
