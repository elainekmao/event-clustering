<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 003922 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR D, P, E, EUR A/S JONES, NEA A/S BURNS, AND </p><p>EUR/SE; DOD FOR DEPSEC AND ASD CROUCH; NSC FOR DEPUTY NSA </p><p>HADLEY AND FRIED. JCS FOR J5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ, PTER, ASEC </p><p>SUBJECT: UNILATERAL ACTIONS BY KURDISH GROUPS CONTINUE TO </p><p>HAMPER FLOW OF HUMANITARIAN AND RECONSTRUCTION ASSISTANCE </p><p>TO IRAQ; TIME FOR A PLAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 3794 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by A/DCM Stuart V. Brown.  Reasons:  1.5 (B </p><p>and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The KDP\'s June 17 refusal to allow a 40-person </p><p>delegation of Iraqi businessmen to cross into Turkey to meet </p><p>with Turkish businessmen, together with the KDP\'s continued </p><p>practice of charging taxes/fees for goods crossing the </p><p>Turkish-Iraqi border (reftel), is disrupting the flow of </p><p>assistance to Iraq and is restricting our overall </p><p>reconstruction efforts.  The Turks responded to the KDP\'s </p><p>refusal to allow the businessmen to cross into Turkey by </p><p>temporarily shutting down Habur Gate and thus halting the </p><p>flow of all goods (humanitarian and commercial, including </p><p>trucks carrying LPG fuel via the Ground Line of </p><p>Communication) into Iraq.  While the KDP has since allowed </p><p>the Iraqis to enter Turkey and the Turks have re-opened Habur </p><p>Gate, this latest KDP action and Turkey\'s reaction is a </p><p>reminder that as along as the Kurdish groups continue to </p><p>"run" the border on their own, reconstruction and </p><p>humanitarian assistance through Turkey will not flow smoothly </p><p>to Iraq.  The KDP\'s unilateral, uncoordinated actions will </p><p>also continue to restrict our ability to press the Turks to </p><p>implement the steps they need to take to open up their side </p><p>of the border.   End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>ACTION </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) We need a plan now that removes the existing obstacles </p><p>to the free flow of assistance and commerce (including </p><p>people) to and from Iraq.  Such a plan must be satisfactory </p><p>to all parties involved and address existing problems on both </p><p>sides of the Turkish-Iraqi border.  For the Turkish side, we </p><p>recommend that the US continue to press the GOT hard to open </p><p>its border fully to two-way trade.  On the Iraqi side, the </p><p>USG needs to devise (with the KDP if necessary) a more </p><p>equitable, transparent system for processing the movement of </p><p>goods and people into/from Iraq.  After we have developed a </p><p>plan and secured a commitment from the KDP to implement it, </p><p>we should brief the Turks on its details and ensure them the </p><p>USG intends to enforce it.  If the KDP resists the plan or </p><p>does not implement it, Washington should instruct US </p><p>officials in Iraq to immediately assume greater </p><p>administrative and security control of the border crossings </p><p>to ensure proper implementation.  End action request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>IRAQI BUSINESS DELEGATION TURNED AWAY AT BORDER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MFA Iraq Department Head Kerim Uras informed us June </p><p>17 that KDP forces had denied a delegation of 40 Iraqi </p><p>businessmen entry into Turkey to meet with Turkish </p><p>businessmen earlier that same day.  Uras said the KDP had </p><p>told the Iraqis (most of whom are Turkmen from Mosul and </p><p>Kirkuk) that they first must travel to Irbil to obtain </p><p>"proper documentation and permission" from KPD officials </p><p>there before they would be permitted to travel to Turkey. </p><p>Uras said that while only half of the individuals possessed </p><p>passports, the GOT was willing to let them enter Turkey using </p><p>Iraqi identification cards given Turkey\'s interest in </p><p>facilitating stronger business ties between the Turkey and </p><p>Iraq.  Uras said that the GOT had complied with past </p><p>practices regarding travel by Iraqis to Turkey by informing </p><p>the KDP at least three days in advance (June 13) of the </p><p>delegation\'s visit and said that the KDP had not objected to </p><p>the visit.  Uras said that some of the Iraqis were being told </p><p>they would have to pay $1,000 to KDP officials in Irbil as </p><p>part of the process of obtaining permission to travel to </p><p>Turkey.  Uras said that when he called the local KDP rep, </p><p>Safeen Dizayee, to complain about the delegation not being </p><p>allowed to travel to Turkey, Dizayee reportedly said the </p><p>delegation was most likely turned away because it had not </p><p>followed the proper procedures and first would need to travel </p><p>to Irbil.  TGS also sent ODC Chief a letter complaining about </p><p>KDP discrimination against Turkmen at the border. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Dizayee told us later June 17 that the KDP did not </p><p>have advance notice of the visit.  He said he first learned </p><p>of the visit that same day when the MFA called to complain </p><p>about the treatment of the delegation at the border.  Noting </p><p>that many of the Iraqis did not possess Iraqi passports, </p><p>Dizayee said "how can Turks demand during the past 12 years </p><p>that all travelers from northern Iraq have passports in order </p><p>to enter Turkey and then, all of a sudden, demand that we let </p><p>anyone cross into Turkey with just an identification card?" </p><p>He defended the requirement that all Iraqis in the north </p><p>travel to Irbil ("the central processing center for the </p><p>north") and argued that all Iraqis are required to pay a fee </p><p>to travel to Turkey.  Dizayee also said that the KDP </p><p>continued to limit the number of visas issued to Iraqis to </p><p>travel to Turkey (five/day), but that if an Iraqi wanted to </p><p>get around this restriction they could pay the Iraqi Turkmen </p><p>Front approximately $650 and "go to the front of the line." </p><p>(Note:  if the KDP is running the border, it is unclear to us </p><p>how the ITF is able to circumvent KDP quotas.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Uras called us late June 17 to report that the KDP had </p><p>changed its position and allowed 20 members of the delegation </p><p>to cross into Turkey.  Uras did not know the reason, but </p><p>suspected that the KDP\'s reversal of position was a result of </p><p>the Embassy\'s earlier inquiry to the KDP and the fact that </p><p>these 20 individuals possessed Iraqi passports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>TURKEY RETALIATES BY TEMPORARILY SHUTTING DOWN HABUR GATE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The US contractor VBR notified US military officials </p><p>at Incirlik early June 18 that the Turks had closed Habur </p><p>Gate.  In response to the Embassy\'s query, the MFA\'s initial </p><p>response was that it was unaware that the border had been </p><p>closed.  The MFA later called back to confirm that Habur Gate </p><p>had indeed been closed temporarily in "retaliation" for the </p><p>KDP\'s discriminatory practices of not allowing the Turkmen to </p><p>enter Turkey, and that the Gate would be open to all commerce </p><p>around 1200 local time.  Uras from the MFA\'s Iraq desk called </p><p>one hour later to report that Gate was open and that priority </p><p>would be given to trucks transporting humanitarian assistance </p><p>and LPG through the GLOC.  At around 1400 (local time), </p><p>trucks carrying UN humanitarian assistance and the LPG via </p><p>the GLOC began to cross the Habur Gate into Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>KDP ALLOWS THE REMAINING BUSINESSMEN TO CROSS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Uras called us at 1300 local June 18 to report that </p><p>the KDP had agreed to allow the remaining 20 Iraqi </p><p>businessmen to cross into Turkey.  Uras said the decision as </p><p>made by KDP leader Nechirvan Barzani following a request (via </p><p>the Ankara KDP rep) by a senior TGS official.  According to </p><p>Uras, Barzani agreed to allow the remaining 20 to cross, but </p><p>said it was "the last time."  From here on out, all travelers </p><p>to Turkey would have to follow the procedures and apply for </p><p>permission from the KDP office in Irbil.  The KDP\'s Dizayee </p><p>separately told us that eight of the remaining 20 had shown </p><p>up at the Iraqi side of the Gate and were being allowed to </p><p>cross.  He did not know the whereabouts of the remaining 12, </p><p>but assured us they would be permitted to cross if/when they </p><p>appeared at the border crossing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Dizayee also said there were approximately 70 Iraqi </p><p>citizens "stranded" at the Habur Gate on the Turkish side of </p><p>the border who were not being allowed to travel to Iraq.  He </p><p>said that the Turkish military officials were only allowing </p><p>those Iraqis who were born in Turkmen-dominated areas of the </p><p>north to cross, and sending back to Turkey those Iraqis from </p><p>KDP and PUK-controlled areas.  Dizayee said that when the </p><p>Iraqis asked why they were not being permitted to cross, the </p><p>Turkish military authorities at Habur reportedly told them </p><p>that "as soon as the 12 remaining Turkmen businessmen cross </p><p>into Turkey, you can cross into Iraq."  Dizayee said that if </p><p>the Iraqis were not permitted to cross by 1700 local (when </p><p>Habur closes), the KDP would be forced to issue a public </p><p>statement criticizing the Turks for not allowing innocent </p><p>civilians to return home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The MFA\'s Uras told us the GOT is aware of the </p><p>presence of the Iraqi civilians on the Turkish side of the </p><p>border waiting to return to Iraq.  He said the MFA is working </p><p>with other GOT agencies to defuse the situation and expressed </p><p>hoped the problem would be solved by "this evening." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
