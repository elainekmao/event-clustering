ILVETSKI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAGR, ETRD, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: Honduran Government Paper on Agricultural Finance </p><p>Reform </p><p> </p><p>REF: Teguz 1581 </p><p> </p><p>1. As indicated in reftel, on June 30 the Finance Minister </p><p>provided to Econcouns a 32-page analysis entitled "Honduran </p><p>Agriculture Laws," intended to answer IMF and USG questions </p><p>on the rationale behind the April 2003 passage of Law 68- </p><p>2003.  The document was prepared by the Finance Ministry </p><p>together with Honduran Banking Commission President Ana </p><p>Cristina de Pereira.   This cable provides a detailed </p><p>English language summary of the paper.   The full Spanish </p><p>language version has been faxed to WHA/CEN (Brett Makens). </p><p>The paper makes the case that the government did the best it </p><p>could, within legal strictures, to limit and manage the </p><p>fiscal cost of a series of imprudent agricultural finance </p><p>laws.  The paper also clarifies that the previous </p><p>agricultural support programs, replaced by Law 68-2003, were </p><p>already being implemented and having a significant effect on </p><p>GOH finances.  Finally, the paper clarifies that the GOH </p><p>understands that resumption of credit to the agriculture </p><p>sector will be a slow process (given the moral hazard </p><p>problems created by these various loan forgiveness </p><p>programs). </p><p> </p><p>Begin Detailed English Language Summary. </p><p> </p><p>HONDURAN AGRICULTURAL LAWS </p><p> </p><p>INTRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p>Several laws that provided financial support to the </p><p>agriculture sector were adopted by the GOH between 2000 and </p><p>2003.  The objectives of these laws was to reactivate </p><p>agricultural production, severely affected by the impact of </p><p>Hurricane Mitch in late 1998 on the value of agricultural </p><p>assets, the capacity of the sector to generate employment </p><p>and income, and on the supply of exportable products. </p><p>Damages from Hurricane Mitch in Honduras have been estimated </p><p>by ECLAC at $2.6 billion (principally agricultural </p><p>production and road and bridge infrastructure). </p><p> </p><p>Government assistance to farmers in these years rested on </p><p>the assumption that the reactivation of agricultural </p><p>production could be achieved by partially resolving the </p><p>financial problems faced by farmers.  The measures taken by </p><p>the government in this period included interest rate </p><p>subsidies and forgiveness of some agricultural debt.   The </p><p>implementation of these measures, however, had two important </p><p>negative effects that doomed the laws to failure: </p><p> </p><p>1) An increase in debt levels resulting from the </p><p>accumulation of interest payments that were capitalized into </p><p>each loan.  This lowered the profitability of new investment </p><p>projects. </p><p> </p><p>2) Each of these laws failed to achieve its expected goals </p><p>and consequently increased the social and political pressure </p><p>for new measures containing additional benefits, raising the </p><p>fiscal cost, increasing the moral hazard, and perpetuating </p><p>the problem instead of resolving it. </p><p> </p><p>At the same time, the debt reduction, interest rate subsidy </p><p>and new credit programs provided to farmers involved high </p><p>costs for the GOH.  Previously, the schemes were expanded in </p><p>order to augment partial payments made by the GOH to the </p><p>financial institutions on behalf of farmers, thus reducing </p><p>the levels of debt (partial forgiveness of the principal). </p><p>This last benefit was financed through the issuance of </p><p>government bonds, sold on market terms. </p><p> </p><p>Given that the conditions of debt restructuring implied </p><p>repayment schedules with long grace periods, the farmers </p><p>could manage the interest payments during the grace period, </p><p>helped by the interest rate subsidy financed by the </p><p>government.  Nonetheless, the lack of viability of the </p><p>mechanisms was made evident when the repayment schedule </p><p>required the amortization of the principal. </p><p> </p><p>The lack of a definitive solution caused increasing fiscal </p><p>commitments without achieving the desired result.  It also </p><p>hurt the functioning of credit markets; in particular, bank </p><p>credit for the agricultural sector declined in real terms. </p><p>The agricultural sector\'s rate of growth and contribution to </p><p>GDP has been declining steadily, with a consequent negative </p><p>effect on the social situation.  Poverty in Honduras is </p><p>concentrated in rural areas. </p><p>Additionally, the Honduran financial system has suffered a </p><p>worsening of the arrears in the credit portfolio and a </p><p>reduction in the profitability of financial institutions, </p><p>because of the increase of the nonproductive assets (bad </p><p>debts and repossessed rural properties) as well as the lack </p><p>of dynamism of new investment projects in the sector. </p><p> </p><p>Recognizing the need to resolve the problem in all its </p><p>dimensions, the GOH has designed a new policy proposal that </p><p>not only seeks to resolve in a definitive form the problem </p><p>of the accumulated debt levels of farmers, but also to </p><p>establish new rules of the game for participants in </p><p>agricultural credit markets, trying to return discipline to </p><p>the market and limiting the fiscal cost associated with the </p><p>implementation of the new mechanism. </p><p> </p><p>THE CONTENT OF THE PREVIOUS AGRICULTURAL FINANCE LAWS </p><p> </p><p>Law 28-2000 </p><p> </p><p>Law 28-2000 entered into effect on April 28, 2000.  It </p><p>created a framework for the alleviation of the financial </p><p>burden on farmers who were affected by natural phenomena and </p><p>had loans in arrears.  The benefits were made available to </p><p>borrowers with loans approved between June 1997 and January </p><p>2000, either with resources from FONAPROVI or private banks. </p><p> </p><p>It established a fixed interest rate of 24 percent for </p><p>direct bank loans and 19 percent for loans from FONAPROVI </p><p>provided for the production of basic grains, vegetables, </p><p>plantains, watermelon, and tubers and 24 percent for the </p><p>remaining types of production.  Interest rate subsidies </p><p>varied from 8-16 percentage points for loans in these </p><p>categories and cattle projects, and 2 percentage points for </p><p>other types of agricultural production. </p><p> </p><p>In addition, Law 28-2000 directed the government to provide </p><p>loan guarantees from resources of the National Complementary </p><p>Guarantee Fund (FONGAC) - a fund administered by FONAPROVI </p><p>with resources transferred by the Ministry of Finance - for </p><p>up to 70 percent of the amount of new loans provided by </p><p>financial institutions for the rehabilitation of farms. </p><p> </p><p>Decree 28-2000 did not establish specific terms for the </p><p>restructuring of farm debts.  But the PRODUCOM program, </p><p>which functioned like a trust fund of the Ministry of </p><p>Finance in FONAPROVI, authorized up to seven years with 18 </p><p>months\' grace period for the payment of rescheduled loans. </p><p> </p><p>The law also approved transfers to the state-owned National </p><p>Bank of Agricultural Development (BANADESA) for 115 million </p><p>lempiras, of which 15 million were to be used for the </p><p>program of supervised credit, which channels small loans to </p><p>the reformed campesino (organized small farmer) sector. </p><p> </p><p>Law 32-2001 </p><p> </p><p>Law 32-2001 established the legal framework to authorize </p><p>interest rate subsidies and reductions in the debt balance </p><p>owed by farmers affected by natural phenomena, who had taken </p><p>out loans for agriculture, forestry, cattle, beekeeping, </p><p>poultry, aquaculture, fishing, agriculture mechanization </p><p>services, irrigation, grain drying, or salt extraction. </p><p> </p><p>Loans approved after June 31, 2000 and beneficiaries of Law </p><p>28-2000 were designated as eligible for the benefits of this </p><p>law.  It provided interest rate subsidies ranged from 7 to </p><p>16 percentage points for basic grains, vegetables, </p><p>plantains, watermelon, tubers, cattle, and coffee and two </p><p>percent for other types of crops. </p><p> </p><p>The law established a maximum amount for loan rescheduling </p><p>of 4 million lempiras per borrower.  It also established a </p><p>reduction in the capital balance for beneficiaries in one of </p><p>the three following situations: </p><p> </p><p>1) Direct credits by banks, FONAPROVI loans, or other </p><p>rediscounting sources, and savings and loan cooperatives, </p><p>affected by natural phenomena and in arrears or due on </p><p>December 31, 2000 and classified as loan risk category III </p><p>or IV; </p><p> </p><p>2) Beneficiaries of Law 28-2000, and </p><p>3) Borrowers from savings and loan cooperatives, under the </p><p>same circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>Debt reduction of 50 percent was provided, up to a maximum </p><p>level of debt forgiveness per borrower of five million </p><p>lempiras. </p><p> </p><p>The law required the banks to provide new loans for the </p><p>rehabilitation of farms, unless the farmers decided to forgo </p><p>this financing in writing.  The farmer had to pay the </p><p>interest owed, from January 1, 2001 through the date of </p><p>presentation of the application. </p><p> </p><p>Of the 50 percent of debt relief, ten percent was financed </p><p>by the banks and 40 percent by the GOH, through the issuance </p><p>of 10-year bonds, with interest rates equivalent to the </p><p>average deposit rate.  The law authorized up to 600 million </p><p>lempiras in government bond issuance. </p><p> </p><p>Two additional mechanisms were established: </p><p> </p><p>1) For original loan balances of 300,000 lempiras and more </p><p>that had financed production of basic grains in areas of 50 </p><p>manzanas or less, the law provided debt forgiveness of 40 </p><p>percent immediately.  An interest rate subsidy of five </p><p>percentage points was authorized for the remaining loan </p><p>balance. </p><p> </p><p>2) For loans by small producers of basic grains with loan </p><p>balances of 50,000 lempira or less classified in loan risk </p><p>categories III and IV, full debt forgiveness (90 percent </p><p>paid by GOH and 10 percent by the banks) was provided. </p><p>Loans classified as risk category V were to be bought by the </p><p>Ministry of Finance with a discount of 80 percent. </p><p> </p><p>The GOH transferred the 115 million lempiras to BANADESA, as </p><p>directed in Law 28-2000, and forgave the debt that BANADESA </p><p>owed to the GOH. </p><p> </p><p>The law established an interest rate subsidy of 8 percent </p><p>for growers of basic grains, to be paid with Central </p><p>Government funds, independently of whether a guarantee was </p><p>received from FONGAC. </p><p> </p><p>Law 128-2001 </p><p> </p><p>Law 128-2001 modified various articles of law 32-2001.  It </p><p>allowed benefits to accrue from the moment that the farmer </p><p>signed the contract with a financial institution.  It also </p><p>expanded the coverage to farmers who had received a loan </p><p>before July 31, 2001, in order to pay a previous loan that </p><p>had qualified for benefits under law 32-2001, and the </p><p>borrowers from banks declared in forced liquidation. </p><p> </p><p>Law 128-2001 created the option of raising the ceiling for </p><p>debt forgiveness from 5 million to 10 million lempiras in </p><p>those cases in which there had been destruction of the </p><p>productive asset. </p><p> </p><p>Law 81-2001 </p><p> </p><p>Law 81-2001 approved the issuance of bonds by FONAPROVI of </p><p>up to 1.2 billion lempiras at terms of 18 months, 10 years </p><p>and 15 years in order to create lines of credit for working </p><p>capital, capital goods and rediscounting of up to 70 percent </p><p>the restructured credits in the previous three laws.  To </p><p>qualify, the loans needed to be used for reactivation and </p><p>rehabilitation of the agriculture sector.  The law provided </p><p>interest rate subsidies of between four and eleven </p><p>percentage points. </p><p> </p><p>Law 11-2002-E </p><p> </p><p>Law 11-2002-E added to the beneficiaries of the interest </p><p>rate subsidies in 81-2002 the following products: </p><p>machinery, equipment and parts; harvesting of pasture; </p><p>construction;  planting; acquisition of livestock and </p><p>poultry; and production of rhyzomes.  It extended the </p><p>deadline for application of benefits to December 31, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS OF THE PREVIOUS DECREES </p><p> </p><p>Interest Rate Subsidies </p><p>The loans that have been covered by interest rate subsidy </p><p>under the different decrees: </p><p> </p><p>Decree 28-2000                  L 1,417.1 million </p><p>Decree 32-2001                  L 2,097.9 million </p><p>Decree 81-2002                  L   848.7 million </p><p>Total                           L 4,363.7 million </p><p> </p><p>During 2000-2002, 195.8 million lempiras in interest rate </p><p>subsidies were provided.  These amounts were provided to </p><p>farmers as reimbursements for interest payments already </p><p>made; these reimbursements were deducted from the value of </p><p>the trust fund.  In Decree 128-2001, the system was changed. </p><p>After that, the farmer only paid the interest net of the </p><p>subsidy, and FONAPROVI credited the account of the financial </p><p>institution directly.  This broke the link between farmer </p><p>compliance with payment obligations and the authorization of </p><p>the GOH to continue authorizing subsidies. </p><p> </p><p>The total amount of interest subsidies authorized by the </p><p>five previous laws was: L 1,494.4 million, of which L 195.8 </p><p>million was paid out during 2000-2003. </p><p> </p><p>Debt Forgiveness </p><p> </p><p>Estimates of costs incurred through the authorization of </p><p>debt forgiveness (as of May 31, 2003) are: </p><p> </p><p>Total bond issue authorized           L 600   million </p><p>Total bonds issued                    L 274.1 million </p><p> </p><p>One large bank, Banco Atlantida, received L 101.2 million in </p><p>bonds (slightly above the 99.4 million authorized as a </p><p>result of errors in program management).  All other banks </p><p>are far under their limits. </p><p> </p><p>Guarantees </p><p> </p><p>The National Fund of Complementary Guarantees (FONGAC) has </p><p>issued certificates to guarantee the payment of balances </p><p>owed by farmers benefiting from the different laws.  After </p><p>taking into account the deductions from the value of the </p><p>trust fund for subsidy payments, there was a legal limit of </p><p>issuance of L465 million in guarantees.  Of this amount, 306 </p><p>million were issued as of December 31, 2002 and another L </p><p>175.7 million were authorized.  FONGAC\'s financial capacity </p><p>to guarantee new loans thus has been totally exhausted.  To </p><p>comply with the obligations for loan guarantees in the laws, </p><p>the Central Government would need to make additional </p><p>transfers to FONAPROVI.  The GOH estimates that this </p><p>contingent liability is L2.5 billion lempiras. </p><p> </p><p>The total committed fiscal resources (estimated at the end </p><p>of May 2003) over the period 2000-2019 is 2.9 billion </p><p>lempira, with another 2.5 billion lempira in contingent </p><p>liabilities for the loan guarantees. </p><p> </p><p>THE PROPOSED NEW POLICY </p><p> </p><p>The policy framework designed to resolve these earlier </p><p>problems is based in the following assumptions: </p><p> </p><p>1. Lending to the agricultural sector is affected negatively </p><p>by structural problems.   Credit risk does not depend on the </p><p>capacity to pay of an individual but on generalized market </p><p>risks such as climatic conditions, or the international </p><p>price of an export crop like coffee. </p><p> </p><p>2. Social and political pressures have resulted in misguided </p><p>policies focused on the reduction of debt levels instead of </p><p>the search for income-generating alternatives.  The attempt </p><p>at debt reduction was not successful because it did not </p><p>materialize immediately and the system permitted the </p><p>capitalization of interest, with the result that debt levels </p><p>actually increased. </p><p> </p><p>3. The benefits have worsened the country\'s payment culture </p><p>and degraded the quality of risk posed by the banks\' </p><p>agricultural clients. </p><p> </p><p>4. The debt burden represents a tax on the profitability of </p><p>future investments in the agricultural sector that provides </p><p>disincentives to the renewal of agricultural activity. </p><p>5. The lack of investment is reducing the supply of </p><p>agricultural production, which in turn negatively affects </p><p>employment, income and the social situation in rural areas. </p><p> </p><p>The new framework is contained in Law 68-2003.  It creates a </p><p>financial mechanism to distribute losses and generate </p><p>conditions that will spur growth in the agricultural sector. </p><p>It supercedes all the previous laws and establishes a </p><p>mechanism that treats all beneficiaries of the program </p><p>uniformly. </p><p> </p><p>Law 68-2003 establishes a government trust fund, financed </p><p>through annual transfers from the Central Government budget, </p><p>of decreasing amounts, starting in 2003 and ending in 2012. </p><p>The trust fund will have the ability to issue securities </p><p>for: </p><p> </p><p>-- Acquisition of the portfolios restructured under decrees </p><p>28-2000, 32-2001, 128-2001, 81-2002, and 11-2002-E.   The </p><p>trust fund will provide debt reduction of 50 percent of the </p><p>balance on the loan at the moment of its acquisition and </p><p>will enter into contracts with the financial institutions </p><p>for the recovery of the remaining 50 percent.  This will be </p><p>done with a payment plan over 10 years and an interest rate </p><p>of 8.725 percent. </p><p> </p><p>-- Payment of the net present value of the interest rate </p><p>subsidies for rehabilitation and reactivation, authorized </p><p>under the mentioned laws.  The GOH will use a discount rate </p><p>of 8.725 percent to calculate the net present value.  The </p><p>borrowers will need to pay the remaining balance of their </p><p>loans, using the original terms. </p><p> </p><p>The law authorizes issuance of government bonds up to a </p><p>maximum of 4 billion lempiras (with the bulk of the funds to </p><p>be used for the purchase of the portfolio accounts </p><p>rescheduled by financial institutions).  The interest rate </p><p>to be paid on the bonds is 5 percent. The bonds will be </p><p>issued for a ten-year period, with annual amortization that </p><p>will be guaranteed (for 50 percent) by the financial </p><p>institutions.  The remaining 50 percent will be guaranteed </p><p>with the amounts paid by the GOH through annual transfers: </p><p> </p><p>Year                      Millions of Lempira </p><p> </p><p>2003                            347.3 </p><p>2004                            322.0 </p><p>2005                            241.5 </p><p>2006                            198.6 </p><p>2007                            173.6 </p><p>2008                            123.5 </p><p>2009                             93.6 </p><p>2010                             77.7 </p><p>2011                             63.8 </p><p>2012                             51.8 </p><p>------                        ------- </p><p>Total                         1,693.4 </p><p> </p><p>Through the investment of the resources received annually, </p><p>FONAPROVI (the National Fund for Production and Housing) </p><p>will generate the necessary resources to cover the interest </p><p>and principal payments.  Thus, the sum of the GOH </p><p>contributions will be lower than the guaranteed amount. </p><p> </p><p>The law repeals the guarantees authorized by the GOH in the </p><p>previous laws for the financial institutions, for </p><p>rescheduled loans and for reactivation and rehabilitation </p><p>loans, including the certificates that had been issued by </p><p>FONGAC. </p><p> </p><p>The decree establishes, in addition, conditions for new </p><p>credits by financial institutions that will be rediscounted </p><p>with FONAPROVI funds: </p><p> </p><p>a) detailed technical and financial evaluation of the loan </p><p>b) crop insurance (covering risks like natural disasters) </p><p>c) contracted marketing mechanism </p><p>d) sufficient guarantees </p><p> </p><p>The law also allows financial institutions to arrange </p><p>insurance or guarantees against price declines, for those </p><p>loans that finance agricultural exports outside of Central </p><p>America.  Embassy Note: These risk reduction mechanisms were </p><p>strongly encouraged by the authors of the IMF-World Bank </p><p>Financial Sector Appraisal (FSAP) for Honduras, completed </p><p>earlier this year.

The majority of the </p><p>beneficiaries already had received payments. </p><p> </p><p>All the legal consultations undertaken by the government </p><p>concluded that it was impossible to apply a new legal </p><p>framework retroactively.  This meant that even when the laws </p><p>were repealed, the only gain was that new farmers could not </p><p>benefit from these laws after the date of the repeal </p><p>entering into force. </p><p> </p><p>For this reason, the government had to look for a financial </p><p>mechanism that simultaneously applied the same level of </p><p>fiscal resources already committed and still permitted the </p><p>reduction of future contingencies, effecting an efficient </p><p>distribution of the economic losses already incurred and </p><p>help the farmers reactivate their operations. </p><p> </p><p>The second important restriction is the existence of deposit </p><p>insurance in Honduras, which guarantees 100 percent of the </p><p>deposits by the public in financial institutions that are </p><p>members of the deposit insurance, until September 2003. </p><p>After this point, the insurance will be limited to 50 </p><p>percent and later to USD 10,000 per depositor after </p><p>September 2004. </p><p> </p><p>Thus, if the government were to have shifted totally the </p><p>losses of the agricultural sector to the financial system, </p><p>it would have led to an immediate recognition of the losses </p><p>by these financial institutions.  This would have occurred </p><p>in the context of a fragile financial sector with a limited </p><p>capacity to generate profits and an ongoing process of </p><p>financial sector consolidation.  The Government of Honduras </p><p>did not consider it in its interest nor its financial </p><p>capacity to undertake these risks. </p><p> </p><p>RECENT EVOLUTION OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR </p><p> </p><p>The amount of agricultural loans covered by the various </p><p>previous laws represented 7.7 percent of the total loan </p><p>portfolio of Honduran commercial banks and 44.6 percent of </p><p>the agricultural loan portfolio (as of Febrary 28, 2003). </p><p>The continual issuance of decrees during the grace periods </p><p>of the loans kept these loans in low category </p><p>classification, with low provisioning requirements, given </p><p>that they still had not arrived at a period of amortization </p><p>of the principal.  Only 4.3 percent of these refinanced </p><p>credits were provisioned as of January 31, meaning that the </p><p>losses came directly out of bank profits or capital during </p><p>those periods, without eliminating the acquired rights by </p><p>the borrowers. </p><p> </p><p>The mechanism created by Law 68-2003 permits financial </p><p>institutions to gradually absorb the impact of their </p><p>respective losses. </p><p> </p><p>New credit provided to the agricultural sector annually has </p><p>fallen precipitously.  These declines were 5.9 percent in </p><p>1999 and then 15.8 percent, 22.1 pecent, and 51.4  percent </p><p>in 2000, 2001, and 2002.  New agricultural loans represented </p><p>only 4.1 percent of the total credit issued by the banking </p><p>system in 2002, down from 8.3 percent in 1998.  The decline </p><p>in agricultural finance is one of the factors contributing </p><p>the stagnation of agricultural production. </p><p> </p><p>Given the recent experience of the commercial banks with </p><p>agricultural loans, no important reactivation of credit for </p><p>this sector is expected in the next few years.  The </p><p>introduction of new rules for the approval of agricultural </p><p>credit will instead be the source of a process of natural </p><p>selection of debtors and a channeling of credit through </p><p>suppliers like agrochemical firms, agricultural service </p><p>providers, concentrate factories, and agricultural </p><p>processing firms. </p><p> </p><p>In the experience of other countries that have had similar </p><p>problems, the change in the sources of credit for the </p><p>agricultural sector have served to restore a payment culture </p><p>and improve the administration of credit risk in the formal </p><p>financial sector. </p><p> </p><p>In addition, this new situation implies the search for </p><p>alternatives on the part of the GOH for the channeling of </p><p>credit to the small producer, through the contracting of </p><p>specialized technical assistance and within the framework of </p><p>bank consolidation. </p><p> </p><p>End Detailed English Language Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
