(U)  SUMMARY: The Honduran Bay Islands of Roatan, Utila, </p><p>and Guanaja are well known narcotrafficking transit points </p><p>and home to countless other illicit activities.  Due to the </p><p>large tourism industry on Roatan and Utila, the GOH has </p><p>chosen to focus its limited counternarcotics resources </p><p>primarily on these two islands.  Guanaja, however, has not </p><p>received the much needed resources to combat its ever-growing </p><p>narcotics problem.  The least developed of the Bay Islands, </p><p>Guanaja\'s limited infrastructure and services have served to </p><p>be a deterrent to tourism.  Additionally, unemployment is </p><p>widespread, creating a safehaven on Guanaja for </p><p>narcotraffickers and organized crime families.  Drug abuse </p><p>among the 6,000 islanders has greatly increased and all </p><p>indications suggest that this trend will continue. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  The Honduran Bay Islands of Roatan, Utila, and </p><p>Guanaja are well known narcotrafficking transit points and </p><p>home to countless other illicit activities.  Roughly 85 </p><p>percent of Guanaja\'s adult population uses crack, cocaine, or </p><p>marijuana according to a recent El Heraldo newspaper report. </p><p>Casual drug use can be observed openly in public, and even </p><p>children as young as 8 years old are known to be regular drug </p><p>users.  The widespread usage of illegal substances may be due </p><p>to the high unemployment rate on the island.  Tourism also </p><p>remains depressed and the fishing industry is not at a </p><p>sustainable level for many families to subsist on.  Thus, </p><p>some people have found employment with the narcotraffickers </p><p>and are often paid in the form of drugs rather than cash, </p><p>creating a cycle of drug abuse. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Honduras is not usually the ultimate destination for </p><p>narcotrafficking transactions, but rather a transit point. </p><p>Much of the product that transits through Guanaja originates </p><p>in South America and is destined for the Cayman Islands and </p><p>the United States.  The most common means of transportation </p><p>in the area of Guanaja is maritime, although planes are also </p><p>used.  Drug runners use 200 horsepower boats that easily </p><p>surpass the 100 horsepower boats used by the Honduran police </p><p>and Navy.  It is common for abandoned packages and boats to </p><p>be found near Guanaja when the traffickers are alerted of the </p><p>presence of authorities.  This in turn makes prosecution </p><p>highly difficult and unlikely. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  The narcotraffickers are protected by the inhabitants </p><p>of Guanaja through methods of terror and assault.  Also, the </p><p>undersupported police authorities of the island do not have </p><p>the manpower to patrol, capture, and prosecute known </p><p>traffickers.  According to the Director of National Police, </p><p>Coralia Rivera, the effectiveness of the police force is </p><p>minimized because they need boats, planes, and helicopters to </p><p>enforce narcotrafficking laws, and these resources are just </p><p>not available. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  COMMENT:  In a recent letter to the Ambassador, the </p><p>Mayor of Guanaja pleaded for some form of direct U.S. </p><p>counternarcotics assistance to combat the presence of drug </p><p>traffickers.  There are recent reports that a fed-up local </p><p>population, acting in a vigilante-style campaign, attacked </p><p>and destroyed the house of a well known drug trafficker. </p><p>Until more resources become available to law enforcement </p><p>agencies in Guanaja, the island will remain very vulnerable </p><p>to the corruption of crime bosses and influential </p><p>narcotraffickers.  Furthermore, much of its population will </p><p>continue to support such activities both through the use of </p><p>narcotics and the protection they provide to the traffickers. </p><p> This problem is not just that of a small island of 6,000 </p><p>inhabitants, but indicative of the larger problem Honduras </p><p>faces as more and more of its territory is compromised by the </p><p>drug trade.  Post believes that additional USG </p><p>counternarcotics resources should be directed at areas like </p><p>Guanaja in order to fight the larger war on drugs.  END </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
