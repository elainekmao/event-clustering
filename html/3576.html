<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002521 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: SOLOMON LAR\'S READOUT OF NIGERIA\'S POLITICAL SCENE </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5(B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Chief Solomon Lar, a longtime Middle Belt </p><p>politician and former Chairman of the PDP, told Ambassador on </p><p>August 19 that President Obasanjo was in a strong position to </p><p>win a second presidential term, even if facing Ibrahim </p><p>Babangida.  Lar also predicted that Obasanjo would be able to </p><p>regain the support of the Tiv, one of the most numerous and </p><p>important Middle Belt ethnic groups and still waiting for an </p><p>apology from the President for the government\'s role in the </p><p>recent army massacre in Benue State.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Perennial Plateau State politician Dr. Solomon Lar </p><p>met with Ambassador and Poloff on August 19 and offered a </p><p>snapshot of the Nigerian political scene, particularly on </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s prospects for re-election.  Responding </p><p>to the Ambassador\'s question, Lar said that if former </p><p>military ruler Ibrahim Babangida (IBB) were Obasanjo\'s main </p><p>opponent for the presidency, Obasanjo would emerge </p><p>victorious.  Lar speculated that Katsina and Sokoto states </p><p>would support Obasanjo.  He also thought that Kano, Kebbi and </p><p>Kaduna would split between the two candidates, commenting </p><p>that throughout northern Nigeria, IBB\'s sentimental support </p><p>as a northerner would be tempered by the negative memories of </p><p>his regime and transgressions against domestic interests in </p><p>many areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  In his assessment of Obasanjo\'s prospects in the </p><p>Middle Belt region, Lar was equally optimistic.  He thought </p><p>that Obasanjo, a Christian, would be able to appeal to the </p><p>embattled feelings of Christians in the area.  Further, Lar </p><p>guaranteed that he would "deliver" the Tivs to the Obasanjo </p><p>camp.  He dismissed the resentment among the Tivs (stemming </p><p>from the army\'s disastrous response to communal violence), </p><p>saying that at the end of the day, they would come back to </p><p>Obasanjo\'s PDP.  Ambassador Jeter noted that the Tivs had </p><p>demanded a public apology from the President, but Lar </p><p>dismissed the demand without commenting on whether Obasanjo </p><p>would offer one. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  Lar has been involved in Middle Belt </p><p>politics for decades, and even in his seventies is striving </p><p>to remain relevant in a society which is searching for fresh </p><p>faces.  His relocation to Abuja, away from his power base in </p><p>Plateau State, is an indication of the lengths he will go in </p><p>order to remain at the center of action and is a possible </p><p>sign of the weakening of his support among the younger </p><p>generation of Middle Belt politicos.  Whether or not he </p><p>remains a relevant player on the regional scene, Lar\'s </p><p>assessment of Obasanjo\'s prospects is influenced by his </p><p>closeness to the Presidency and his efforts to convince it of </p><p>his own importance. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
