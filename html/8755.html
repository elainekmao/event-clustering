The Tigers, in semi-threatening </p><p>tones, have complained about the sea incident and denied </p><p>involvement in the Jaffna slaying.  The latest incidents </p><p>have placed added strain on the peace process.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>===================== </p><p>Sinking of Tiger Ship </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Two violent incidents on Saturday, June 14, </p><p>have sparked an increase in tension between the Tigers </p><p>and the Sri Lankan government.  In the first incident, </p><p>according to the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN), its vessels </p><p>intercepted two ships belonging to the Liberation Tigers </p><p>of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) approximately 110 nautical miles </p><p>off the northeast coast in the Bay of Bengal early </p><p>morning June 14.  (Note:  Some SLN sources have stated </p><p>that the incident took place closer to 175 miles off </p><p>shore; the LTTE has claimed it took place over 260 miles </p><p>off shore -- see below.)  Based on what the SLN has </p><p>said, the two LTTE ships refused to return to port under </p><p>escort and began to fire at the SLN ships.  In response, </p><p>the SLN, which had only fired some warning shots, </p><p>commenced firing at the ships, and, suddenly, one of </p><p>them exploded and subsequently sank.  The other LTTE </p><p>ship escaped and has not been re-intercepted as of late </p><p>June 16.  (Note:  There are unconfirmed reports in the </p><p>Sri Lankan press that the Indian military is providing </p><p>the GSL intelligence and other assistance in locating </p><p>the ship that escaped.)  Judging by the secondary </p><p>explosions on the boat that sank, the SLN believes that </p><p>the LTTE ship was an arms resupply vessel.  According to </p><p>press reports, up to 12 cadre were on the vessel that </p><p>sank.  They are all presumed dead (though the LTTE has </p><p>stated that the crew was abducted by the navy -- see </p><p>below). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) There is some confusion over the SLN\'s version </p><p>of events, primarily over how the LTTE ship was sunk. </p><p>The president\'s office, for example, announced that the </p><p>LTTE ship sank due to SLN firing, and had not self- </p><p>detonated as the navy has been claiming.  The government </p><p>has not yet worked out this discrepancy.  (Note:  For </p><p>its part, the LTTE has asserted that the navy sank its </p><p>ship -- see below.  There have been previous incidents </p><p>when LTTE sea cadre self-detonated their vessels after </p><p>being intercepted by the SLN, killing themselves in the </p><p>process.  In the most recent sea incident, which took </p><p>place in March, however, a LTTE vessel was sunk off the </p><p>northeast coast by SLN gunnery, with the loss of its 11- </p><p>member LTTE crew.  For additional details on the June 14 </p><p>sea incident, please see DATT Septel.) </p><p> </p><p>========================== </p><p>LTTE complains to Monitors </p><p>========================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The LTTE has bitterly complained to the </p><p>monitors over the June 14 sea incident.  In a somewhat </p><p>confusing letter to the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM), Tiger political chief S.P. </p><p>Thamilchelvam asserted that the SLN had destroyed the </p><p>ship (which he said was an "oil tanker"), although it </p><p>was acting peaceably and following all the SLN\'s orders. </p><p>(Note:  The letter was posted on "TamilNet," a pro-LTTE </p><p>website, on June 15.)  Thamilchelvam also claimed that </p><p>the LTTE\'s ship had been intercepted in "international </p><p>waters" over 260 nautical miles off the northeast coast </p><p>(as opposed to the 110 or 175 miles variously claimed by </p><p>the SLN).  Wrapping up, Thamilchelvam asked for the SLMM </p><p>to look into the matter, stating (menacingly): </p><p> </p><p>"We hold the SLN fully responsible for the unlawful </p><p>destruction of our vessel and criminal abduction of our </p><p>cadre...We are afraid that the SLN is working hard on a </p><p>sabotage course of the entire peace process.  We wish to </p><p>advise you that the SLN will have to bear responsibility </p><p>for any dire consequences that may arise as a result of </p><p>their action.  Please favor us with an early report, </p><p>taking into consideration the seriousness of the </p><p>incident and our concern for the lives of our cadres." </p><p> </p><p>(Note:  The navy has denied the accusation made above by </p><p>Thamilchelvam that it has detained the LTTE personnel on </p><p>board the ship that sank.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The SLMM has confirmed that it is looking into </p><p>the matter.  Agnes Bragadottir, the SLMM spokeswoman, </p><p>told us that her organization was in touch with both the </p><p>Tigers and the GSL over the incident.  She allowed that </p><p>rough seas off the northeast coast were helping retard </p><p>efforts by SLMM sea monitors to investigate what </p><p>transpired, but said the SLMM would keep trying. </p><p>Bragadottir said it was not clear how many LTTE crew </p><p>members were on board the ship (she thought there were </p><p>about 12), but the SLMM was using its good offices to </p><p>account for them.  (Note:  Bragadottir confirmed that </p><p>the SLMM had also been in touch with the Tigers on </p><p>Friday, June 13, over the case of two police officers </p><p>being held by the Tigers in the east -- see Reftels.) </p><p> </p><p>======================= </p><p>Assassination in Jaffna </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In the other violent incident taking place on </p><p>June 14, a high-level Tamil opponent of the Tigers was </p><p>assassinated in Jaffna town.  From what Mission </p><p>understands, Kandiah Subathiran (FYI:  Confusingly, </p><p>Subathiran went by several names with various </p><p>spellings), a high-ranking official in the anti-LTTE </p><p>Eelam People\'s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), </p><p>was shot and killed while exercising on the roof of his </p><p>house/office early June 14.  The sniper, who escaped, is </p><p>believed to have been some distance away, perhaps hiding </p><p>in a nearby school, when he fired the shots. </p><p>Subathiran\'s killing brings the number of anti-LTTE </p><p>Tamils who have been killed in the past several months </p><p>to almost 30 (See Ref B).  (Note:  Mission personnel had </p><p>met Subathiran on several occasions, but he was not a </p><p>close contact.  Subathiran was a former elected </p><p>official, serving on Jaffna\'s local council). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Via the generally pro-LTTE elements of the Tamil </p><p>National Alliance political grouping, the Tamil Tigers </p><p>have denied any involvement in the June 14 killing. </p><p>This fits into the pattern of previous killings of anti- </p><p>LTTE Tamil opponents, all of which the Tigers have </p><p>denied they were responsible for (see Reftels). </p><p>(Note:  In addition to the June 14 Jaffna killing, </p><p>another Tamil was gunned down on June 15, this time in </p><p>the Batticaloa area of the east.  The victim is believed </p><p>to have defected from the LTTE several years ago.) </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The peace track has already been under </p><p>considerable strain due to the Tigers\' refusal to come </p><p>back to the face-to-face talks right away, as well as </p><p>their failure to show up at the Tokyo donors conference </p><p>(see Ref B).  These latest incidents have only served to </p><p>increase the strain in two major ways.  First, in regard </p><p>to the latest sea incident (such confrontations have </p><p>been a recurring problem for the ceasefire), it is </p><p>apparent that the LTTE is very angry over what happened </p><p>and it is reacting in a semi-threatening manner. </p><p>Second, the assassination in Jaffna -- which was almost </p><p>certainly perpetrated by the LTTE -- was brazen to say </p><p>the least and leads to more questions about the Tigers\' </p><p>intentions.  At this time, the government\'s reaction to </p><p>this new load of problems is unclear.  Trying to point </p><p>things back in the right direction after the highly </p><p>successful Tokyo conference is clearly proving a </p><p>challenge, however.  (Note:  In June 16 comments to the </p><p>press, G.L. Peiris, a key minister, said the government </p><p>was putting together new proposals for the LTTE\'s review </p><p>regarding the formation of an interim structure to run </p><p>the north/east.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
