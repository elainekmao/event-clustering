<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ADANA 0125 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY </p><p>MAY 1, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for May 1, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Cumhuriyet: The dead body of Siddik Kaya, the </p><p>victim of a mysterious killing in Varto, was </p><p>found on the bank of the Murat River. The </p><p>Istanbul Forensic Medicine Department determined </p><p>firearms had killed Kaya before he was thrown </p><p>into the river. The HRA announced that more </p><p>disappearance cases were being reported to their </p><p>chapters after Kaya\'s body was found. The family </p><p>of Riza Koc also applied to Mus\' HRA Chapter to </p><p>help them determine the whereabouts of their son. </p><p>Riza Koc closed his grocery store in Mus the </p><p>night of September 13, 2002, and left with a </p><p>friend.  He was never seen or heard from again </p><p>after he separated from his friend. According to </p><p>reports, Koc told his wife one-day before his </p><p>disappearance that two pedestrians followed him. </p><p>The inhabitants of the quarter where Koc lived </p><p>reported a suspicious vehicle was constantly </p><p>moving in their neighborhood and they reported </p><p>its license plates. After some research, it was </p><p>discovered the Security Directorate of Mus owned </p><p>the suspicious vehicle. After receiving no </p><p>affirmative responses from the Mus\' Security </p><p>Directorate about Riza Koc\'s whereabouts, Koc\'s </p><p>relatives sought assistance from the HRA Chapter </p><p>in Mus. The HRA President in Mus, Sevim Yetkiner, </p><p>said "Koc\'s family did not apply to us for </p><p>reasons such as lack of education and fear, but </p><p>we will investigate their case. It is very </p><p>interesting that the Koc case has not been </p><p>exposed up to now." Another mysterious killing is </p><p>reported from Yuksekova. Mustafa Kanbas (49) </p><p>wanted to swap his car with the car of Master </p><p>Sergeant Riza Karabacak from the Yuksekova </p><p>District Jandarma Command. After dropping off a </p><p>relative of his at the 4th Jandarma Border Brigade </p><p>in Sirnak on April 18, Kanbas set off for </p><p>Yuksekova the next morning. One week later, </p><p>Kanbas\' dead body was found on a heap of sand on </p><p>the shores of the Zap River. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Radikal: Three judges from the European Human </p><p>Rights Court (EHRC) interrogated Turkey between </p><p>April 28 and April 30 at hearings closed to </p><p>public in a Courthouse in Ankara. The judges </p><p>heard claims that Serdar Tanis and Ebubekir Deniz </p><p>disappeared while detained under the supervision </p><p>of Silopi\'s District Chairman of HADEP. The </p><p>judges took statements from 30 persons, including </p><p>military officers and villagers. Some of the </p><p>villagers made their statements in Kurdish. Tanis </p><p>and Deniz were last seen at Silopi District </p><p>Jandarma Command on January 25, 2001. Then </p><p>Commander of Provincial Jandarma Command, Levent </p><p>Ersoz, did not report to the court even though he </p><p>was on the list of people to make a statement </p><p>before the EHRC judges. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Evrensel: By aiming a pistol at her head, the </p><p>police in Adana intimidated a woman they had </p><p>harassed with a truncheon to withdraw her appeal </p><p>to the European Human Rights Court (EHRC). Later, </p><p>MAY 01, 2003 </p><p>the police kicked the 55 year-old woman off the </p><p>car and into the street. The woman said she was </p><p>cooking for her family when the police raided her </p><p>house on April 23, 2003, and asked her to </p><p>withdraw her application to EHRC. She said the </p><p>police left her house so that her neighbors would </p><p>not become suspicious. She stated she went to the </p><p>Turkish Red Crescent\'s Policlinic on April 28 to </p><p>receive medical care.  She had been receiving </p><p>medical care there because of the torture she had </p><p>experienced in 1996. She further said, she gave </p><p>an account of her experience with the police to </p><p>the Human Rights Association. She recalled the </p><p>police forced her into their car while she was </p><p>buying bread from a booth, and cursed her as they </p><p>shut her eyes and mouth, and finally, kicked her </p><p>from the car. She added, because of fear of the </p><p>police, her neighbors did not dare to visit her </p><p>even when she was sick, and claimed that she was </p><p>being isolated. She filed a petition of complaint </p><p>with the Chief Public Prosecutor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Radikal/Turkiye: After the US took Iraq under </p><p>control, it has been removing the military </p><p>structure it had established in the post-First </p><p>Gulf War. Ending its military presence in Saudi </p><p>Arabia the previous day, the US will end </p><p>Operation Northern Watch (ONW) as well with a </p><p>ceremony at Incirlik AFB today. ONW, which </p><p>provided security in the "no fly zones" above the </p><p>36th parallel in northern Iraq and below the 32nd </p><p>parallel in southern Iraq, started in 1997. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Radikal/Turkiye/Tercuman: In its "2002 Global </p><p>Terrorism," report, the US Administration </p><p>signaled it was open to a dialogue with Syria, </p><p>which was shown as a target after Iraq. The </p><p>report mentioned Syria and Libya, Cuba, Iran, </p><p>Iraq, North Korea, and Sudan, as "countries </p><p>supporting terrorism" and outlined Syria\'s and </p><p>Libya\'s support of terrorism had decreased. In </p><p>addition to DHKP-C, PKK/KADEK has also been </p><p>included in the list of the terrorist </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Hurriyet: The "2002 Global Terrorism" report </p><p>published by the State Department announced the </p><p>PKK/KADEK organization armed 8,000 warriors. The </p><p>report said KADEK continued arming about 8,000 </p><p>trained warriors in and around Turkey while it </p><p>claimed it was abiding by the peace initiative it </p><p>had declared. The report announced Turkey was one </p><p>of the US\'s steadfast allies in combating </p><p>terrorism. It was noted Turkey had suggested </p><p>assigning a special force of 90 soldiers for </p><p>combating terrorism in Afghanistan and had </p><p>participated to the UN-led ISAF in Afghanistan </p><p>with 1,400 troops. From Turkey, DHKP-C and </p><p>PKK/KADEK have been included in the terrorists\' </p><p>list that named 36 foreign terrorist </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Turkiye: Naile Yavuz (14) and Songul Yavuz </p><p>(16) were wounded while picking bushes in rural </p><p>Kizilhac yesterday because the ordinance they </p><p>found among the bushes exploded. After medical </p><p>treatment at Mus State Hospital, the girls were </p><p>discharged, and an investigation is underway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Turkiye: As a result of ensuing clashes </p><p>between the security forces patrolling the </p><p>Habizbin region and a group of PKK terrorists who </p><p>disobeyed a "halt" warning, one terrorist was </p><p>killed while two others were wounded. The </p><p>security forces\' operations in the region are </p><p>still continuing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Sabah: During Foreign Minister (FM) Abdullah </p><p>Gul\'s visit to Damascus, the Syrian Head of </p><p>State, Beshar Essad, suggested Syria market its </p><p>natural gas in Europe versus in Turkey and Gul </p><p>proposed Turkey would clear the 850 kilometer- </p><p>long Turkish-Syrian border of land mines. The </p><p>collective belief is that the water and Hatay </p><p>issues would be resolved more easily if economic </p><p>cooperation between both countries developed. The </p><p>parties decided holding a Turkish-Syrian Joint </p><p>Economic Meeting in Syria on May 15, and the </p><p>Turkish-Syrian Business Council Meeting in Turkey </p><p>on May 20. The Turkish and Syrian sides decided </p><p>on signing an agreement exempting trade between </p><p>both countries from taxes. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
