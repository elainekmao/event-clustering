<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ACCRA 002693 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, GH </p><p>SUBJECT: GHANA: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 201772 </p><p> </p><p>THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO REFTEL PARAGRAPH TWO: </p><p> </p><p>A.  SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TO SUPPORT COALITION AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>THE GOG CONDEMNED, PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY, THE SEPTEMBER 11, </p><p>2001 ATTACKS AGAINST THE U.S., AND EXPRESSED ITS SYMPATHY, </p><p>AGAIN PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY, FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE ATTACKS. </p><p>IN THE YEAR SINCE THE ATTACKS THE GOG HAS ON SEVERAL </p><p>OCCASIONS RENEWED ITS CONDEMNATIONS AND EXPRESSIONS OF </p><p>SYMPATHY.  FOR EXAMPLE, HIGH LEVEL DELEGATIONS, LED BY MUSLIM </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT ALIU MOHAMMED, ATTENDED THE MISSION\'S </p><p>THREE-MONTH AND ONE-YEAR COMMEMORATIVE CEREMONIES, AND MADE </p><p>VERY SUPPORTIVE REMARKS.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO BEEN VERY </p><p>SUPPORTIVE IN CONCRETE TERMS AS WELL, FROM INCREASED SECURITY </p><p>AT MISSION COMPOUNDS, TO HEIGHTENED SHARING OF INFORMATION </p><p>FROM POLICE, IMMIGRATION, MILITARY AND OTHER CONTACTS.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WELCOMED ASSISTANCE IN THE SUPPRESSION OF </p><p>TERRORIST FINANCING, AND HELD USEFUL MEETINGS WITH US </p><p>TREASURY OFFICIALS ON MONITORING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.  THE </p><p>GOG ADOPTED FIVE ANTI-TERRORIST CONVENTIONS TO WHICH IT WAS </p><p>NOT YET A MEMBER IN JULY, INCLUDING THE CONVENTION TO </p><p>SUPPRESS TERRORIST FINANCING, AND NOW SUBSCRIBES TO ALL 12 </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS ON TERRORISM.  AT THE SAME TIME, IT </p><p>ALSO ADOPTED THE OAU CONVENTION AGAINST TERRORISM.  IT IS IN </p><p>THE PROCESS OF DRAFTING LOCAL LEGISLATION TO PUT ITS CRIMINAL </p><p>CODE AND FINANCIAL MONITORING REGIMES IN HARMONY WITH THESE </p><p>VARIOUS CONVENTIONS.  KEY SECURITY OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO </p><p>INDICATE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW U.S. AIR AND NAVAL ASSETS </p><p>TO TRANSIT GHANA, OR MAKE USE OF LOCAL FACILITIES, IF NEEDED </p><p>(AS DEMONSTRATED BY THEIR GREAT COOPERATION IN THE USE OF </p><p>KOTOKA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN ACCRA FOR THE RECENT </p><p>EVACUATION OF U.S. CITIZENS FROM COTE D\'IVOIRE). </p><p> </p><p>B.  RESPONSE OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO ACTS OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL/DOMESTIC TERROR: </p><p> </p><p>THE GHANAIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM DID NOT HAVE OCCASION TO RESPOND </p><p>TO ANY ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERROR IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>C.  EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT RECEIVE ANY REQUESTS TO EXTRADITE, NOR </p><p>REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF, ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>D.  SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO EXTRADITION: </p><p> </p><p>THERE ARE NO IMPEDIMENTS TO EXTRADITION OR PROSECUTION OF </p><p>SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  THE U.S. AND GHANA HAVE AN EXTRADITION </p><p>TREATY. </p><p> </p><p>E.  HOST RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: </p><p> </p><p>SEE ANSWER TO ITEM A. </p><p> </p><p>F.  MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS BY HOST GOVERNMENT: </p><p> </p><p>SEE RESPONSE TO ITEM A. </p><p> </p><p>G.  HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM: </p><p> </p><p>NONE. </p><p> </p><p>H.  HOST GOVERNMENT PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A </p><p>TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE: </p><p> </p><p>NONE. </p><p> </p><p>I. CHANGES, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN HOST GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM SINCE PREVIOUS YEAR: </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM HAS, POST 9/11, </p><p>CONTINUED TO BE FOCUSED AND RESULTS-ORIENTED, WITH CLOSE </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE MISSION ON LOCAL SECURITY AND TRANSIT OF </p><p>SUSPICIOUS THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS. </p><p> </p><p>J.  U.S. COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS WITH THE HOST GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. HAS ASKED FOR, AND HAS RECEIVED, CONTINUED CLOSE </p><p>COOPERATION FROM GHANAIAN SECURITY FORCES POST SEPTEMBER 11, </p><p>2001.  GHANA HAS AGREED ON THE NECESSITY TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN ITS OVERSIGHT OF SUSPICIOUS FINANCIAL </p><p>TRANSACTIONS.  A TREASURY DELEGATION CONDUCTED USEFUL </p><p>MEETINGS WITH CENTRAL BANK AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE OFFICIALS </p><p>ON THE TIGHTENING OF LOCAL FINANCIAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, </p><p>AND THE GOVERNMENT IS DRAFTING LEGISLATION TO EFFECT THIS. </p><p>THE MISSION SUCCESSFULLY LOBBIED THE GOVERNMENT ON ADOPTION </p><p>OF THE FIVE REMAINING ANTI-TERRORIST CONVENTIONS TO WHICH IT </p><p>HAD NOT YET SUBSCRIBED, AND HAS ALSO ENCOURAGED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO REVISE THE LOCAL CRIMINAL CODE, WHICH IT IS NOW </p><p>UNDERTAKING. </p><p> </p><p>K.  COOPERATION DURING THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN </p><p>INVESTIGATION/PROSECUTION OF TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST AMERICAN </p><p>CITIZENS/INTERESTS: </p><p> </p><p>ASIDE FROM THE COOPERATION DETAILED ABOVE REGARDING SEPTEMBER </p><p>11, 2001 AND THE ENSUING MONTHS, THE GOVERNMENT MADE STRONGLY </p><p>SUPPORTIVE STATEMENTS FOLLOWING THE EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN EAST </p><p>AFRICA IN 1998, AND ASSISTED WITH ENHANCED SECURITY FOR </p><p>MISSION FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>L.  COOPERATION DURING PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN PREVENTION OF </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST AMERICAN CITIZENS/INTERESTS: </p><p> </p><p>SAME AS PREVIOUS ANSWER. </p><p> </p><p>RASPOLIC </p><p></p></div>
