<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ZAGREB 001926 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA; USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL 5/18/00 </p><p>TAGS: War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT: "RSK PRESIDENT" MARTIC -- UNREPENTANT </p><p>         BUT POSSIBLY UNDER PRESSURE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>MARTIC STILL BOASTFUL, AGGRESSIVE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>- </p><p>2.  WHILE WE HAVE HAD NO DIRECT CONTACT WITH "RSK </p><p>PRESIDENT" MILAN MARTIC SINCE THE EVENTS OF MAY 1-3, </p><p>UNSRSG AKASHI, WHO MET HIM ON MAY 16, REPORTED TO THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT MARTIC\'S MOOD REMAINS "BAD," AND THAT </p><p>HE IS "OBSESSED" WITH SITUATION IN WESTERN SLAVONIA AND </p><p>THE QUESTION OF "NORMALIZATION" THERE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BY MOST OTHER ACCOUNTS, TOO, THE BELLIGERENT MOOD </p><p>MARTIC EXHIBITED IMMEDIATELY AFTER MAY 1 IS ESSENTIALLY </p><p>UNCHANGED.  THREE WESTERN JOURNALISTS WHO WERE </p><p>IN/AROUND KNIN MAY 13-14 ALL TOLD PAO THEY FOUND MARTIC </p><p>TO BE SEEMINGLY "CONFIDENT" AND MAINTAINING HIS </p><p>BLUSTER, EVIDENTLY UNCHASTENED BY THE CROATIAN SUCCESS </p><p>IN RECAPTURING WESTERN SLAVONIA.  ONE OF THEM ALSO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01926  01 OF 02  181438Z </p><p>THOUGHT THAT MARTIC\'S POPULAR SUPPORT, EVEN AMONG THE </p><p>EDUCATED ELITE, HAD GROWN AS A RESULT OF THE CROATIAN </p><p>ACTION MAY 1.  EVEN MODERATES IN THE "RSK," THE </p><p>JOURNALIST SAID, HAVE COME TO BELIEVE THAT THE CROATS </p><p>CANNOT BE TRUSTED, AND THEY "ARE ANGRY THAT MIKELIC </p><p>BLAMED THE WHOLE MESS ON MARTIC." </p><p> </p><p>4.  COUNTERBALANCING THIS LATTER ASSERTION, HOWEVER, </p><p>ARE REPORTS THAT MARTIC\'S FAILURE TO "SAVE" SECTOR WEST </p><p>HAS WEAKENED HIS SUPPORT, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE RANK- </p><p>AND-FILE "RSK" MILITARY.  ONE TV BROADCOAST REPORTEDLY </p><p>SHOWED MARTIC BLUSTERING BEFORE "RSK" MILITARY UNITS </p><p>AND BEING ANSWERED WITH SARCASTIC JEERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THERE ARE ALSO OTHER INDICATIONS THAT MARTIC\'S </p><p>POSITION IS LESS FIRM THAN IT WAS.  UN DEPUTY CIVIL </p><p>AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR SECTOR SOUTH, SAIJIN ZHANG, </p><p>INDICATED HE THOUGHT RENEWED MILITARY ACTION BY THE </p><p>KRAJINA SERBS WAS UNLIKELY LARGELY BECAUSE THE "RSK" </p><p>LEADERSHIP WOULD BE "VERY BUSY INTERNALLY" FOR AT LEAST </p><p>A WHILE.  BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE ON LEAVE MAY 14, ZHANG\'S </p><p>BOSS, JURIJ MIAKOTNYKH, WHOM WE CONSIDER GENERALLY A </p><p>MORE INFORMED SOURCE, TOLD A UN COLLEAGUE THAT HE DID </p><p>NOT FORESEE MARTIC\'S TAKING ANY NEW STEPS WITHIN "THE </p><p>NEXT TWO WEEKS" BUT THAT SOME "MONSTROUS" ALTERNATIVES </p><p>WERE UNDER CONSIDERATION.  (COMMENT: AT THIS STAGE WE </p><p>BELIEVE THIS TELLS US MORE ABOUT MARTIC\'S STATE OF MIND </p><p>THAN ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC ACTIONS HE MAY TAKE, ESPECIALLY </p><p>TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION OUR COMMENTS BELOW.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01926  01 OF 02  181438Z </p><p>CELEKETIC RESIGNATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE MAY 14 RESIGNATION OF THE "RSK" FORCE COMMANDER </p><p>CELEKETIC, A HARDLINER WHO WAS A CLOSE POLITICAL ALLY </p><p>OF MARTIC, ALSO SUGGESTS THAT MARTIC IS WEAKENED, </p><p>POSSIBLY VIS-A-VIS HIS DOMESTIC POLITICAL RIVALS AS A </p><p>RESULT OF HIS FAILURE TO DEFEND "RSK" TERRITORY IN </p><p>SECTOR WEST, AND ALMOST CERTAINLY VIS-A-VIS MILOSEVIC. </p><p>CELEKETIC\'S SUCCESSOR, GENERAL MILE MRKSIC (PRON: MURK- </p><p>SHEETCH), IS A MILOSEVIC CHOICE WHO COMES TO HIS NEW </p><p>POSITION FROM THE JNA STAFF IN BELGRADE.  THE CHANGE </p><p>GIVES MILOSEVIC A VETO OVER MARTIC\'S MILITARY </p><p>ADVENTURISM.  FURTHER, MRKSIC MAY OR MAY NOT PROVE TO </p><p>BE AS CLOSE A WORKING PARTNER FOR MARTIC AS CELEKETIC, </p><p>SO HIS APPOINTMENT TO SOME DEGREE REDUCES MARTIC\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO CARRY THE DAY IN THE "RSK\'S" SENIOR </p><p>POLICYMAKING COUNCILS.  EVEN IF SACRIFICING CELEKETIC </p><p>WAS, AS ZHANG BELIEVES, "THE PRICE MARTIC HAD TO PAY TO </p><p>STAY," THIS TOO INDICATES THAT MARTIC WAS UNDER </p><p>PRESSURE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ5920 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5920 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01926  02 OF 02  181438Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  OASY-00  DOEE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-08    L-01     ADS-00   M-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01 </p><p>      P-01     SP-00    SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      PRMC-01  DRL-09   G-00       /027W </p><p>                  ------------------C70273  181439Z /38 </p><p>P 181533Z MAY 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 5825 </p><p>INFO CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XP/IN// </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J5-PMA/J21// </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5// </p><p>HQUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>COM SIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01926  02 OF 02  181438Z </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 001926 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR BOSNIA; USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL 5/18/00 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV PINR HR </p><p>SUBJECT: "RSK PRESIDENT" MARTIC -- UNREPENTANT </p><p>         BUT POSSIBLY UNDER PRESSURE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.

WE INTERPRET THAT MAY 15 STATEMENT AS A </p><p>CYNICAL ATTEMPT ON MARTIC\'S PART TO BACKTRACK FROM HIS </p><p>EARLIER BOAST, AND AN INDICATION THAT ME MAY HAVE </p><p>RECOGNIZED HE HAD GONE TOO FAR IN LEAVING HIMSELF OPEN </p><p>TO WAR CRIMES CHARGES. </p><p>- </p><p>8.
