(SBU) SUMMARY: AN EXCHANGE OF LETTERS BETWEEN WORLD </p><p>FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THE WORLD </p><p>HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) DIRECTOR GENERAL REVEALED THAT </p><p>THE WHO DIRECTOR GENERAL IS MISINFORMED CONCERNING THE </p><p>ADVANCE INFORMED AGREEMENT PROVISION OF THE CARTAGENA </p><p>PROTOCOL.  IN URGING WFP TO "OPERATE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE </p><p>PROTOCOL" AND "INFORM IMPORTING COUNTRIES OF THE NATURE </p><p>OF CONSIGNMENTS," DIRECTOR GENERAL BRUNTLAND IS ECHOING </p><p>EUROPEAN COMMENTS MADE AT THE LAST WFP BOARD MEETING ON </p><p>THIS SUBJECT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) MISSION HAS BEEN INFO\'ED (PLEASE PROTECT) ON A </p><p>LETTER FROM WHO DIRECTOR GENERAL (DG) BRUNTLAND TO WFP </p><p>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MORRIS ON THE SUBJECT OF GMO FOOD AID. </p><p>THE LETTER, REPEATED BELOW IN ITS ENTIRETY, SHOWS THAT </p><p>THE WHO DG IS MISINFORMED CONCERNING THE ADVANCE INFORMED </p><p>AGREEMENT PROVISION OF THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL (WHICH DOES </p><p>NOT APPLY TO SHIPMENTS OF FOOD OR FEED).  FURTHERMORE, IN </p><p>URGING WFP TO "OPERATE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE PROTOCOL" AND </p><p>"INFORM IMPORTING COUNTRIES OF THE NATURE OF </p><p>CONSIGNMENTS," DIRECTOR GENERAL BRUNTLAND IS PROVIDING AN </p><p>INTERPRETATION -- IN ADVANCE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE, AND A </p><p>DECISION BY THE STATES PARTIES -- OF ARTICLE 18.2 (A) </p><p>WHICH STATES THAT EACH PARTY SHALL TAKE MEASURES TO </p><p>REQUIRE THAT DOCUMENTATION ACCOMPANYING LIVING MODIFIED </p><p>    ORGANISMS (LMO\'S) INTENDED FOR DIRECT USE AS FOOD OR </p><p>FEED, OR FOR PROCESSING, CLEARLY IDENTIFY THAT THEY MAY </p><p>CONTAIN LMO\'S AND ARE NOT INTENDED FOR INTENTIONAL </p><p>INTRODUCTION INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) COMMENT:  THE WHO DG\'S STATEMENT IS ALMOST </p><p>IDENTICAL TO VIEWS EXPRESSED BY EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERS AT </p><p>THE LAST WFP BOARD MEETING ON THIS SUBJECT.  THE LETTER </p><p>PERPETUATES MISINFORMATION CONCERNING WHAT WILL AND WILL </p><p>NOT BE REQUIRED BY THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL (ONCE IT ENTERS </p><p>INTO FORCE). END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) BEGIN TEXT OF LETTER: </p><p> </p><p>DEAR MR. MORRIS, </p><p> </p><p>THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER DATED 10 APRIL 2003.  I </p><p>APPRECIATE IT THAT YOU KEPT ME INFORMED ON DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>EMANATING FROM THE SOUTHERN AFRICA CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND WFP FOR PREPARING A POLICY </p><p>DOCUMENT ON FOOD AID THAT MAY CONTAIN GM MATERIAL.  IN MY </p><p>VIEW THE STATEMENT IS CAREFULLY DRAFTED.  WFP STATES THAT </p><p>FOOD DONATIONS MUST ADHERE TO INTERNATIONALLY AGREED </p><p>STANDARDS THAT APPLY TO FOOD IN TRADE.  THIS CERTAINLY </p><p>WILL INCLUDE CODEX STANDARDS, AIMING AT THE PROTECTION OF </p><p>THE HEALTH OF CONSUMERS.  I SHARE YOUR POSITION THAT WFP </p><p>CANNOT IMPOSE PROVISIONS OF THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL ON </p><p>COUNTRIES NOT BEING SIGNATORIES OF THAT PROTOCOL.  IN </p><p>PRACTICE, HOWEVER, THIS MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT </p><p>CONSEQUENCES. </p><p></p><p>A KEY ELEMENT IN THE PROTOCOL IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE </p><p>ADVANCE INFORMED AGREEMENT (AIA).  EXPORTING COUNTRIES </p><p>HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO INFORM IMPORTING COUNTRIES ON THE </p><p>NATURE OF CONSIGNMENTS.  IN PARTICULAR IN THE CASE OF GM </p><p>FOOD THIS IS A RELEVANT PROVISION AS WE HAVE SEEN LAST </p><p>YEAR WHEN GM FOOD AID WAS PROVIDED BY WFP TO SEVERAL </p><p>COUNTRIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.  ALTHOUGH WFP CANNOT IMPOSE </p><p>THE PROTOCOL ON COUNTRIES, THE QUESTION RISES WHETHER </p><p>NEVERTHELESS THE WFP WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN THE </p><p>SPIRIT OF THE PROTOCOL.  THIS IMPLIES THE GMO NATURE OF </p><p>FOOD AID HAS TO BE KNOWN TO ALLOW YOUR COUNTRY OFFICES TO </p><p>WORK AS INDICATED IN THE STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>I THOUGHT IT APPROPRIATE TO BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION. </p><p>I WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE COOPERATION OF OUR </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS AREA. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT OF LETTER.  TAMLYN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02269 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
