<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ISLAMABAD 007636 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR S/CT </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR SA/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: (1.6X1) </p><p>TAGS:  KPRP, PINR, PTER, PK </p><p>SUBJ:  JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (C-NA7-00565) </p><p> </p><p>REFTELS:  A)  STATE 106548  B)  NEW DELHI 6957  C)  ISLAMABAD 5640 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS TOM PRICE.  REASON:  1.5 (C). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL (A) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON THE </p><p>JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF), POLOFF, ACCOMPANIED BY POL </p><p>FSN, VISITED THE JKIF\'S ISLAMABAD OFFICE ON SEPTEMBER 4.  MAKING AN </p><p>APPOINTMENT TO MEET WITH THE JKIF WAS SOMETHING OF AN ORDEAL, BUT </p><p>POL FSN FINALLY MANAGED TO TRACK DOWN AN ISLAMABAD PHONE NUMBER </p><p>(445699) FOR THE GROUP.  WHEN HE CALLED THE OFFICE, THE PERSON WHO </p><p>ANSWERED REPEATEDLY ASKED IF THE CALL WAS BEING TAPED.  "IF SO, I </p><p>WILL SPEAK MORE CLEARLY," HE SAID, EVEN AFTER BEING ASSURED THAT </p><p>THE CONVERSATION WAS NOT BEING MONITORED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  FINDING THE JKIF OFFICE WAS ALMOST AS DIFFICULT AS MAKING </p><p>AN APPOINTMENT.  LOCATED IN THE CAPITAL CITY\'S WESTERNMOST SUBURBS, </p><p>THE GROUP\'S HOUSE IS TUCKED INTO A NARROW ALLEY IN THE I/10-2 </p><p>SECTOR (STREET 10, GALI (ALLEY) 27, HOUSE 1908).  POLOFFS WERE </p><p>USHERED INTO THE HOUSE BY DR. HAIDER, WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS </p><p>VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE JKIF.  HE IN TURN INTRODUCED BILAL BAIG, </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE JKIF, AND SYED ALI RAZA, WHOM HAIDER DESCRIBED AS </p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF JKIF\'S POLITICAL WING IN MUZAFFARABAD.  HAIDER, </p><p>WHO HAILS FROM BARAMULLA DISTRICT OF INDIAN KASHMIR AND SAYS HE HAS </p><p>A MEDICAL DEGREE, DID MOST OF THE TALKING DURING THE NEXT HOUR-AND- </p><p>A-HALF, THOUGH RAZA DID SPEAK UP OCCASIONALLY, AND BAIG APPEARED TO </p><p>BE FOLLOWING THE CONVERSATION CLOSELY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  HAIDER NEEDED LITTLE PROMPTING TO LAUNCH INTO A CONVOLUTED </p><p>EXPLANATION OF THE GROUP\'S HISTORY AND ITS PHILOSOPHY, MOST OF </p><p>WHICH IS COVERED MORE COMPREHENSIBLY IN REFTELS B AND C.  HAIDER </p><p>SAID THE GROUP BEGAN AS A PEACEFUL ORGANIZATION CALLED THE JAMMU </p><p>AND KASHMIR STUDENTS\' LIBERATION FRONT IN 1988 AND GRADUALLY </p><p>METAMORPHOSED INTO THE JKIF OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS.  HAIDER SAID HIS OWN CONVERSION TO VIOLENCE TOOK PLACE IN </p><p>APRIL 1992, WHEN HE WAS DETAINED AND TORTURED BY INDIAN TROOPS IN </p><p>SRINAGAR.  ROLLING UP HIS PANTS LEG TO REVEAL SEVERAL UGLY GOUGES </p><p>IN HIS SKIN, HAIDER SAID HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO ELECTRIC SHOCKS </p><p>AND SEVERE BEATINGS WHILE IN CUSTODY.  SINCE THEN, HAIDER SAID, HIS </p><p>ELDER BROTHER HAD BEEN KILLED AND HIS FAMILY HOME DESTROYED BY </p><p>INDIAN TROOPS, WHILE HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO FLEE TO PAKISTAN IN </p><p>1994.  "HE TOO HAS SUFFERED," HAIDER SAID POINTING TO BAIG, WHO WAS </p><p>SITTING IMPASSIVELY ACROSS THE ROOM.  BAIG\'S SISTER-IN-LAW AND </p><p>FATHER WERE KILLED BY INDIAN TROOPS, HAIDER CHARGED, AND HIS </p><p>SISTER, FARADA BAHANJI, HAS BEEN IMPRISONED IN NEW DELHI\'S TIHAR </p><p>JAIL FOR OVER A YEAR BECAUSE OF HER BROTHER\'S ACTIVITIES.  TO CAP </p><p>OFF THIS LITANY OF ABUSE, HAIDER PRODUCED SEVERAL PHOTOS OF </p><p>CORPSES, ALL OF WHOM ALLEGEDLY DIED AT THE HANDS OF INDIAN SECURITY </p><p>FORCES.  ONE PHOTO PURPORTEDLY SHOWED THE REMAINS OF BAIG\'S FAMILY </p><p>HOME WITH A SNAPSHOT OF HIS SISTER SUPERIMPOSED ON IT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  WHEN PRESSED TO ELABORATE ON THE GROUP\'S POLITICAL </p><p>PHILOSOPHY, HAIDER DEFERRED TO RAZA, A YOUNG, THIN MAN WITH A FULL </p><p>BEARD AND TURBAN.  RAZA SAID THE JKIF HAD ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO </p><p>FORMULATE A POLITICAL AGENDA AND THE FOCUS WAS STILL ON ARMED </p><p>RESISTANCE TO INDIAN OCCUPATION OF KASHMIR.  THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE </p><p>JKIF IS KASHMIRI INDEPENDENCE, HE COMMENTED, BUT AFTER INDIAN </p><p>TROOPS VACATE KASHMIR, THE GROUP WOULD THEN BE AMENABLE TO </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UN RESOLUTIONS, EVEN IF THAT MEANT A VOTE TO </p><p>JOIN INDIA.  THE JKIF IS PRIMARILY A NATIONALIST MOVEMENT, RAZA </p><p>CONTINUED, AND DOES NOT ESPOUSE A PARTICULARLY RADICAL BRAND OF </p><p>ISLAM, DESPITE ITS NAME.  AT THIS POINT, HAIDER JUMPED IN AND ENDED </p><p>THIS SEGMENT OF THE CONVERSATION BY EMBARKING ON A LONG, RAMBLING </p><p>DISCOURSE ABOUT THE COMMON ROOTS OF JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS, </p><p>WHILE TAKING PAINS TO MENTION THAT THE JKIF WAS NOT AGAINST </p><p>"ORDINARY HINDUS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  TURNING TO THE GROUP\'S MILITARY OPERATIONS, HAIDER SAID </p><p>THE JKIF\'S PRIMARY TARGETS ARE INDIAN REGULAR AND PARAMILITARY </p><p>FORCES IN KASHMIR, THOUGH HE ADDED THAT "THOSE WHO COMPROMISE" WITH </p><p>THE INDIANS WERE ALSO KILLED.  ASKED WHOM THE JKIF CONSIDERED </p><p>"COMPROMISERS," HAIDER LISTED BUREAUCRATS AND POLITICIANS IN THE </p><p>JAMMU AND KASHMIR GOVERNMENT AS THE MAIN CULPRITS, BUT STATED THAT </p><p>ANYONE WHO "BECOMES A HINDRANCE" WAS ALSO A POTENTIAL TARGET, </p><p>INCLUDING MUSLIM COLLABORATORS.  HAIDER BECAME QUITE AGITATED WHEN </p><p>DISCUSSING THOSE WHOM THE JKIF CONSIDERED ENEMIES, REPEATEDLY </p><p>BARING HIS CHEST WHILE STATING THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO DIE FOR </p><p>KASHMIRI INDEPENDENCE.  "I WOULD KILL THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER IF </p><p>I COULD," HE ASSERTED.  A FAVORITE METHOD OF ATTACKING INDIAN </p><p>TROOPS IS SUICIDE BOMBINGS, HAIDER ASSERTED, "JUST LIKE HAMAS IN </p><p>ISRAEL."  RDX IS THE EXPLOSIVE OF CHOICE, HE EXPLAINED, AND ATTACKS </p><p>ARE CAREFULLY PLANNED AFTER TARGETS ARE CASED FOR SEVERAL DAYS. </p><p>HAIDER WAS EVASIVE WHEN ASKED ABOUT BOMBINGS OF NON-MILITARY </p><p>TARGETS, BUT HE VEHEMENTLY DENIED THAT THE JKIF WAS A TERRORIST </p><p>GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  HAIDER ESTIMATED THE JKIF\'S STRENGTH AT BETWEEN 500 AND </p><p>1,000 MILITANTS, DOWN CONSIDERABLY FROM THEIR PEAK IN 1992, WHEN </p><p>THE GROUP BOASTED 4,000 FIGHTERS.  THE INDIANS HAVE KILLED MORE </p><p>THAN 2,000 JKIF FIGHTERS SINCE THEN, HAIDER ADMITTED, BUT HE SAID </p><p>THE GROUP STILL FIELDED THE SECOND-LARGEST MILITANT FORCE IN </p><p>KASHMIR AFTER THE HIZBUL MUJAHEDDIN (NOTE:  ALMOST EVERY KASHMIRI </p><p>MILITANT GROUP CLAIMS TO HAVE THE SECOND-LARGEST NUMBER OF FIGHTERS </p><p>IN INDIAN KASHMIR, BUT ALL AGREE THAT THE HIZBUL MUJAHEDDIN IS </p><p>NUMBER ONE).  ROUGHLY 200 FIGHTERS ARE IN AZAD KASHMIR AT ANY GIVEN </p><p>TIME, WHILE THE REST ARE OPERATING INSIDE INDIAN KASHMIR.  TRAINING </p><p>TAKES PLACE IN CAMPS IN AZAD KASHMIR, HAIDER EXPLAINED, BUT HE </p><p>DENIED THAT THE GROUP RECEIVED ANY ASSISTANCE FROM THE PAKISTANI </p><p>ARMY.  ALL OF THE JKIF\'S FIGHTERS ARE KASHMIRIS, EITHER FROM AZAD </p><p>OR INDIAN KASHMIR, HAIDER CLAIMED, THOUGH HE CONCEDED THAT "ONE OR </p><p>TWO" AFGHANS COULD BE IN THE GROUP WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE.  RECRUITS </p><p>RANGE IN AGE FROM TEENAGERS TO MEN IN THEIR 40\'S AND 50\'S, AND ALL </p><p>RECEIVE ONE TO TWO MONTHS TRAINING BEFORE BEING SENT ACROSS THE </p><p>LINE-OF-CONTROL (LOC) INTO INDIAN KASHMIR.  CROSSING THE LOC IS </p><p>EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, HAIDER SAID, THEREFORE THE SIZE OF </p><p>INFILTRATING GROUPS IS KEPT SMALL -- NO MORE THAN 20 MEN -- SO THAT </p><p>CASUALTIES ARE LIMITED IF THE GROUP IS CAUGHT IN AN INDIAN AMBUSH. </p><p>HAIDER DENIED THAT PAKISTANI TROOPS PROVIDE COVERING FIRE FOR JKIF </p><p>MILITANTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  COMMENT:  HAIDER SAID HE WOULD PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION </p><p>ABOUT THE GROUP AT OUR NEXT MEETING, WHILE BOTH HE AND BAIG, WHO </p><p>HAD REMAINED SILENT THROUGHOUT, EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE U.S. </p><p>VIEWED JKIF AS A TERRORIST OUTFIT (SOMETHING WHICH WE DID NOT BRING </p><p>UP FOR FEAR OF PROVOKING AN ABRUPT END TO OUR VISIT).  USHERING US </p><p>TO THE DOOR, HAIDER WHISPERED THAT HE WOULD ALSO SHARE WITH US </p><p>"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION" ABOUT THE APHC\'S ACTIVITIES THE NEXT </p><p>TIME WE MET.  OBVIOUSLY MUCH OF WHAT SAID BY THESE MEN WAS TAILORED </p><p>TO FIT THE AUDIENCE, BUT WE OFFER IT FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, AND WE </p><p>WILL ATTEMPT GLEAN MORE ABOUT THE GROUP AND THEIR ACTIVITIES IN </p><p>FUTURE MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SIMONS </p><p></p></div>
