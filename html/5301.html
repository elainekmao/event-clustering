PERINCEK:  FOUR AMERICANS MUST BE DEPORTED </p><p>(Milliyet)  Dogu Perincek, leader of the Workers\' </p><p>Party (IP), claimed that the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs had found out that the U.S. and the PKK </p><p>had had meetings and that the U.S. had given the </p><p>PKK USD 125 million.  Perincek noted that he had </p><p>sent a file on this subject to the Turkish </p><p>General Staff (TGS).  Perincek added that both </p><p>the U.S. Embassy and the PKK had confirmed these </p><p>contacts in their statements.  According to </p><p>Perincek, "the U.S. Embassy\'s second man Robert </p><p>Deutsch, Joseph Penington of the CIA Station in </p><p>Adana, Political Counselor Nicholas Kass, and </p><p>Istanbul U.S. Consulate General Political Unit </p><p>Chief Stephen C. Kimmel" arranged the contacts. </p><p>"These persons must be deported," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  WAR EXERCISE AT INCIRLIK </p><p>(Sabah)  While preparations continue at the </p><p>Incirlik Air Base (Adana), nearly 5,000 U.S. </p><p>soldiers, as well as their families, are carrying </p><p>out an exercise to practice getting into shelters </p><p>in the shortest time possible, in preparation for </p><p>a possible nuclear attack.  The exercise, in </p><p>which all soldiers and civilians participate, </p><p>will last three days.  Experts said the base is </p><p>fully equipped for a war and noted that shelters </p><p>house materials that will meet all kinds of needs </p><p>for a period of three months. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  THREE TURKIHS FIRMS WILL SUPPLY BUNKS </p><p>(Sabah)  Three Turkish firms, Alfa, Piril, and </p><p>Maya, have won the nearly USD 1 million bidding </p><p>tender opened for bunks and beds for U.S. </p><p>soldiers to be deployed at Adana\'s Incirlik Air </p><p>Base.  The firms will reportedly provide the </p><p>4,400 bunk beds and 8,800 beds by the requested </p><p>date.  Incirlik Air Base will reportedly open new </p><p>bidding tenders in the upcoming days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  U.S. EXPERTS RETURNING </p><p>(Milliyet)  Of the 150-person U.S. delegation </p><p>surveying airports, ports and railway stations in </p><p>Turkey as part of preparations for a possible </p><p>operation against Iraq, two teams flew out of the </p><p>Incirlik Air Base (Adana) on January 22.  Another </p><p>group of U.S. experts is reportedly scheduled to </p><p>leave this morning (1/23). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  ANTI-WAR SENTIMENTS </p><p>(Milli Gazete/Turkiye)  Adana Chamber of Industry </p><p>President Umit Ozgumus said the possible U.S. </p><p>operation against Iraq would give most damage to </p><p>Turkey.  Bas called on Turkey to comply with U.N. </p><p>resolutions.  Adana Chamber of Commerce (ACOC) </p><p>President Saban Bas, for his part, said a war had </p><p>started in the region 12 years ago and continued </p><p>since 1991.  Bas added Turkey suffered a loss of </p><p>USD 100-150 billion and the Southeast a loss of </p><p>USD 60-70 billion from this war.  Bolge reported </p><p>that the Adana chapter of the Public Training </p><p>Center (Halkevleri) had opened its "Peace </p><p>Declaration" to the public\'s signature in protest </p><p>of the possible U.S. operation against Iraq. </p><p>Evrensel reported that police had arrested seven </p><p>People\'s Democracy Party (HADEP) members in Mus </p><p>and Igdir provinces for distribution of anti-war </p><p>manifestos prepared by the HADEP\'s National Youth </p><p>Commission.  Manifestos, as well as some books, </p><p>were confiscated during a search of the HADEP </p><p>offices.  The Adana chapter of the Emekli-Sen </p><p>labor union protested a possible U.S. attack </p><p>against Iraq and distributed "Let\'s Stop This </p><p>War" handbills.  Several political parties, the </p><p>Pharmacists\' Chamber, and the Human Rights </p><p>Association supported the protest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  DISK RELEASES ANTI-WAR STATEMENT IN </p><p>DIYARBAKIR </p><p>(Milli Gazete)  In a press conference prior to </p><p>the Confederation of the Revolutionary Workers\' </p><p>Unions\' (DISK) Presidents\' Council Meeting in </p><p>Diyarbakir, DISK National President Suleyman </p><p>Celebi said DISK supported the anti-war attitudes </p><p>displayed by the government, but did not find </p><p>them sufficient.  Celebi indicated that the fact </p><p>that DISK Regional Representative\'s Office had </p><p>been re-opened in Diyarbakir after a long period </p><p>of time was a significant step for workers.  He </p><p>noted that the region had not experienced </p><p>ordinary life for a long time, facing economic, </p><p>as well as social and cultural, difficulties.  He </p><p>added:  "During this time, people could not enjoy </p><p>their fundamental human rights and political </p><p>freedoms.  New obstacles emerge just when some </p><p>things are about to change.  A war threat and </p><p>ploys of those expecting a profit from a war </p><p>emerge.  The reason why we are having our meeting </p><p>here is extremely obvious.  A war is at our </p><p>doorstep, that is, right next to our Southeast. </p><p>We will suffer its pains and difficulties all </p><p>together.  Our citizens in Istanbul and those in </p><p>Diyarbakir, Sirnak, and Hakkari will not live </p><p>(suffer from) the problem at the same level.  Our </p><p>Southeastern provinces and villages will be among </p><p>targets of mortar shells and long-range missiles. </p><p>Established orders (peace and order) will be </p><p>disrupted, newly-established homes will be ruined </p><p>once again."  Celebi stressed that DISK would </p><p>shout anti-war cries at Sirnak\'s Habur border </p><p>gate, (possible U.S.) war\'s zero point, on </p><p>January 24 and start staging new anti-war </p><p>demonstrations beginning on January 26.  Turkiye </p><p>quoted Celebi as saying DISK officials met in </p><p>Diyarbakir to discuss what can be done to prevent </p><p>a possible U.S.-led war in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  ALLEGATION OF INCREASED ANTI-DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PRACTICES </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  The People\'s Democracy Party </p><p>(HADEP) Youth Commission reacted negatively to </p><p>the arrest of five HADEP officials and two HADEP </p><p>members in Diyarbakir.  The national center (the </p><p>headquarters) of the HADEP Youth Commission </p><p>released a January 22 statement stating that </p><p>Turkey is being pulled into a war as a result of </p><p>possible U.S. military intervention in Iraq.  The </p><p>statement added that, as a result of this, ani- </p><p>dmoratc raties adinceaed,wih mny </p><p>political party officials and members having been </p><p>arrested for staging anti-war demonstrations.  It </p><p>called on the government to end these practices. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  TURKEY IS READY FOR A WAVE OF REFUGEES </p><p>(Turkiye)  Ferda Cemiloglu Cilalioglu, Former </p><p>President of the Refugees and Migrants Solidarity </p><p>Association (SGDD), said Turkey is ready for an </p><p>influx of refugees likely to come from Iraq in </p><p>the event of a war.  Cilalioglu added Turkey is </p><p>now more systematic, compared to the Gulf War. </p><p>She noted that, between 1988-1991, Turkey three </p><p>times had opened its doors to a total of 460,000 </p><p>refugees from Iraq, which she described as the </p><p>largest migration movement after the Second World </p><p>War. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  ANTI-NUCLEAR TRAINING IN ADANA </p><p>(Turkiye/Bolge)  The Turkish Atomic Energy </p><p>Organization (TAEK), in collaboration with the </p><p>International Atomic Energy Agency, organized a </p><p>seminar to inform police and Jandarma about </p><p>possible nuclear attacks.  A similar activity was </p><p>held in Mersin, as well.  In his speech, TAEK\'s </p><p>Nuclear Engineer Yilmaz Bektur said Turkey was </p><p>not under the threat of nuclear attack, claiming </p><p>that the seminar was not related to war.  "We are </p><p>informing our nation because the subject of </p><p>nuclear energy has entered our lives at all </p><p>stages.  That is, it is not directly related to </p><p>war," he continued.  He added that these seminars </p><p>had been held in 16 of the 81 provinces and would </p><p>be repeated in the remaining provinces. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  SEVEN KADEK SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN ADANA </p><p>(Bolge)  During anti-KADEK operations in Adana\'s </p><p>Sakirpasa and Ova districts, Anti-Terror </p><p>Department teams arrested seven KADEK (PKK) </p><p>suspects, a district chief among them.  With </p><p>orders from high-level KADEK officials, the </p><p>arrestees had reportedly been plotting to launch </p><p>attacks against security forces.  The arrestees </p><p>reportedly admitted having staged a tire-burning </p><p>demonstration during which they closed the D-400 </p><p>highway to traffic and having plotted Molotov </p><p>cocktail attacks against official buildings and </p><p>schools. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  BOMB ATTACK ON AK PARTY OFFICE </p><p>(Evrensel)  Unidentified assailants threw a </p><p>Molotov cocktail at AK Party\'s Kayapinar </p><p>(Diyarbakir) district office on January 22.  No </p><p>casualties were reported, while the office\'s </p><p>window glasses were broken.  An investigation is </p><p>underway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  DIYARBAKIR HRA ISSUES ITS 2002 REPORT </p><p>(Evrensel)  In a press conference, the Diyarbakir </p><p>chapter of the Human Rights Association (HRA) </p><p>publicized its 2002 report on human rights </p><p>violations.  Chapter President Selahattin </p><p>Demirtas described the lifting of the State of </p><p>Emergency (OHAL), the abolition of the death </p><p>penalty, and legal reforms regarding mother- </p><p>tongue education, as well as amendments to the </p><p>Meetings, Demonstrations and Marches Law, as </p><p>positive.  Demirtas claimed human rights abuses </p><p>increased despite these improvements.  Demirtas </p><p>noted that bans on the import of certain </p><p>newspapers and magazines had automatically ended </p><p>with the lifting of OHAL, but "OHAL habits" </p><p>continued.  He pointed to a 101% increase in </p><p>landmine accidents in 2002 compared to the </p><p>previous year.  Arrests of pro-mother tongue </p><p>advocates increased by 15%, with torture </p><p>remaining on the agenda.  Demirtas stressed that </p><p>tension resulting from isolation imposed on </p><p>KADEK/PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is gradually </p><p>turning into social unrest, endangering peace and </p><p>compromise efforts in recent years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  TRIAL OF BISMIL (DIYARBAKIR) VILLAGE GUARDS </p><p>CONTINUES </p><p>(Evrensel)  The trial of ten Bismil (Diyarbakir) </p><p>village guards continued at the Diyarbakir Felony </p><p>Court on January 22.  The village guards, </p><p>including four in custody, were charged with </p><p>killing three people and wounding four others as </p><p>a result of an armed attack on two families who </p><p>had returned to Bismil\'s Ugrak village.  The </p><p>court ordered the four defendants to remain in </p><p>custody and adjourned the trial until a later </p><p>date to await the results of a criminal analysis </p><p>of the bullet casings found at the scene. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  MOTHER WANTS HER JAILED SON TO BE GIVEN </p><p>MEDICAL TREATMENT </p><p>(Evrensel)  Fatma Kurt, mother of Feridun Kurt </p><p>incarcerated in Adana\'s Ceyhan township, claimed </p><p>her son had been denied medical treatment for </p><p>health problems that resulted from torture in the </p><p>prison.  Kurt alleged she had many times applied </p><p>to officials, but failed to receive a positive </p><p>result. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  AZADIYA WELAT MARKS ITS EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY </p><p>(Evrensel)  Kurdish-language Azadiya Welat </p><p>Newspaper organized a celebration on January 21 </p><p>to mark its eighth anniversary.
