<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000480 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/ERIEDEL </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PTER, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S CEASE-FIRE:  HINTS OF MAOIST STRATEGY FROM </p><p>THE MIDWEST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A. KATHMANDU 312 </p><p> </p><p>     B. B. KATHMANDU 477 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert K. Boggs for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Econoff visited Nepalgunj and Jumla districts of </p><p>midwestern Nepal from March 4 to 7 to assess the effects of </p><p>the cease-fire.  Despite statements from the Maoists at the </p><p>national level (Ref A), insurgents in the Midwest Development </p><p>Region are still using rhetoric calling for the establishment </p><p>of a communist republic, the dissolution of the Royal </p><p>Nepalese Army, and elimination of the constitutional </p><p>monarchy.  Despite the cease-fire, Maoists continue to hold </p><p>mass meetings, extort funds, and carry weapons in the </p><p>midwest.  The activities of the Maoists in rural parts of the </p><p>country raise serious questions regarding the sustainability </p><p>of the cease-fire and the success of future negotiations. </p><p>(Note: This is the second in a series of reports on this </p><p>recent trip.  See Ref B for first report.)  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Away from the Center, Maoist Rhetoric Differs </p><p>============================================= </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Econoff visited Nepalgunj and Jumla districts of </p><p>midwestern Nepal from March 4 to 7 to assess the effects of </p><p>the cease-fire.  According to a number of reliable sources, </p><p>including businessmen, politicians, government officials, </p><p>social activists, and local residents, the Maoists in the </p><p>Midwest Development Region, often called the Maoist </p><p>heartland, made strikingly different statements from those of </p><p>the Maoist leadership.  For example, during preliminary </p><p>negotiations in Kathmandu, the Maoists have indicated that </p><p>they are willing to support the principles of multi-party </p><p>democracy and constitutional monarchy (Ref A).  However, </p><p>Rajendra Mohat, Jumla Local Representative of the </p><p>non-governmental organization (NGO) INSEC, summarized the </p><p>insurgents\' objectives, as expressed to him by local Maoists, </p><p>as: </p><p>-- 1. Secure the leadership of Baburam Bhattarai, head of the </p><p>Maoist negotiating team and the Maoists\' number two </p><p>ideologue, in a constituent assembly; </p><p>-- 2. Use Maoist leadership of the constituent assembly to </p><p>transform Nepal into a communist republic; </p><p>-- 3. Dissolve the Royal Nepal Army and re-establish the </p><p>national armed forces on the Maoist militia model; and </p><p>-- 4. Offer the King a position of respect "without </p><p>facilities," meaning a title without authority, budget, or </p><p>official residence. </p><p> </p><p>Is the Cease-Fire a Tactic? </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Most government officers without regular, direct </p><p>interaction with the Maoists had similar impressions of </p><p>Maoist intent.  Dilli Raj Joshi, Chief District Officer of </p><p>Banke, the midwest\'s economic center, stated that </p><p>negotiations were doomed to fail as the Maoists had not given </p><p>up their main objective of attaining power by building a </p><p>communist republic.  The Senior Superintendent of Police in </p><p>Jumla, Madan Khadka, also learned through his sources that </p><p>the Maoists at the grass-roots level are continuing to call </p><p>for a republic.  He surmises that Maoist-Government </p><p>negotiations at the national level are a tactic to buy time. </p><p>It is the consensus of both police and government officers in </p><p>Jumla that it is only a matter of time before the cease-fire </p><p>collapses and Jumla will be one of the first sites attacked </p><p>again. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) During econoff\'s visit, only Him Gurung, Deputy </p><p>Inspector General of Police for the region in Nepalgunj, was </p><p>optimistic about the prospects for the peace process.  He </p><p>opined that the Maoists have exhausted themselves and now </p><p>must return to the political process.  He believes that the </p><p>Maoists have eroded their public support and must use </p><p>coercion to maintain their political base.  Other </p><p>interlocutors echoed his perception that the Maoists were </p><p>exhausted, due to various causes, e.g., increased Indian </p><p>security along the border, Maoist losses incurred in </p><p>November, and pressure from the international community. </p><p>However, Gurung\'s belief that the Maoists can muster support </p><p>only through the threat of force was not repeated by other </p><p>sources. </p><p>Talking Peace, Maintaining Force </p><p>================================ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Maoists continue to hold mass meetings, extort </p><p>funds, and openly carry weapons in Jumla.  Three major trails </p><p>from the north, west and east enter the district headquarters </p><p>(there are no motorable roads).  On all of these axes, the </p><p>Maoists continue to demonstrate their strength.  According to </p><p>Jumla\'s Police and INSEC Representative, the Maoists have </p><p>massed several hundred cadres with weapons, including </p><p>explosives, three hours to the west in Tatopani.  Villagers </p><p>coming to the district headquarters to buy government rice </p><p>report that Maoists have established a gate and a bridge two </p><p>kilometers east of Jumla.  The villagers added that the </p><p>Maoists had stopped harassing them since the beginning of the </p><p>cease-fire.  In Sinja, one day\'s walk to the north, Major </p><p>Khanal, the Company Commander of the local Royal Nepal Army </p><p>garrison, stated that the Maoists had recently held a mass </p><p>meeting with weapons.  During his visit, econoff observed </p><p>Maoist flags surrounding the district headquarters.  The </p><p>flags had been planted on the anniversary of the launching of </p><p>the Maoist "People\'s War" (February 13) and, according to </p><p>local residents, demarcate Maoist-controlled territory. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The information gathered on this recent trip exposes </p><p>some glaring differences in Maoist rhetoric at the national </p><p>and local levels.  This inconsistency reinforces the </p><p>suspicion of many at senior levels of Nepal\'s security forces </p><p>that the cease-fire is a Maoist tactic to buy time and </p><p>attempt to achieve revolutionary goals through manipulation </p><p>of the fractious political setup at the center.  The </p><p>insurgents\' ambitious objectives, as described by INSEC\'s </p><p>local representative, present some difficult negotiating </p><p>challenges--if not obstacles--for the Nepali government.  Any </p><p>delay or refusal to accede on the part of the government </p><p>could serve as a pretext for the Maoists to call an end to </p><p>the cease-fire. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
