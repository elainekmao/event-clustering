<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000875 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OREP, PREL, EFIN, BEXP, MASS, SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: CODEL Hastert Meets Obasanjo, National Assembly </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  In a six hour visit on April 17, CODEL </p><p>Hastert met with President Obasanjo, and, separately, with </p><p>Speaker of the House Ghali Na\'Abba and other assembly </p><p>members.  With Obasanjo Speaker Hastert emphasized USG </p><p>commitment to AGOA, and to HIV/AIDS programming assistance </p><p>and basic healthcare assistance for Nigeria. Obasanjo </p><p>replied with praise for AGOA, and with recitations of both </p><p>the Nigerian fight against HIV/AIDS, and Nigeria\'s </p><p>extensive efforts to promote peace in the West African </p><p>region and in other African countries., In a largely </p><p>ceremonial meeting at the National Assembly Speaker Na\'Abba </p><p>called for a joint committee to explore areas of mutual </p><p>interest between the National Assembly and the US Congress. </p><p>Speaker Hastert indicated privately to the Ambassador that </p><p>he would explore the idea but thought that annual meetings </p><p>between the staff of the two legislatures was a better and </p><p>more viable course of action.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  On Tuesday, April 17, in the course of a six hour visit </p><p>to Abuja, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives </p><p>Dennis Hastert and nine House colleagues met with President </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo at the Presidential Villa, and with </p><p>Speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives Ghali </p><p>Na\'Abba and several dozen of his fellow members at the </p><p>National Assembly.  The Hastert CODEL also lunched with </p><p>Speaker Na\'Abba and approximately 75 members of the House. </p><p>At the Presidential Villa, Speaker Hastert began the </p><p>meeting by highlighting three areas in which the USG had </p><p>undertaken particular efforts to strengthen its </p><p>relationship with African nations generally and with </p><p>Nigeria in particular.  With the African Growth and </p><p>Opportunity Act (AGOA), said Hastert, the US Congress had </p><p>"worked hard" to offer an avenue for enhanced economic </p><p>growth and for mutually beneficial trade.  Speaker Hastert </p><p>then noted that the U.S. Congress had doubled funds for </p><p>HIV/AIDS programs in Africa.  He then emphasized the </p><p>fundamental importance the USG placed on assistance with </p><p>health care programs in Nigeria.  "We are trying to build </p><p>on our already strong relationship with Nigeria," the </p><p>Speaker said.  He then turned to his colleagues to add </p><p>their comments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Representative E.B. Johnson, ranking Democrat on the </p><p>CODEL, and Chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus, </p><p>noted this was her third visit to Nigeria, a sign of her </p><p>personal commitment to Nigerian progress.  The USG, she </p><p>went on, meant to encourage democracy both in Nigeria and </p><p>on the continent as a whole.  Speaking of the multi-racial </p><p>and multi-cultural society of the United States, she said </p><p>that "we are a diverse people, but this does not divide us, </p><p>it defines us."  Johnson offered this concept of </p><p>cohesiveness-through-diversity as a proper formula for </p><p>Nigeria as well, with its many language and ethnic groups, </p><p>and its religious diversity.  "We will work with you, and </p><p>help build democracy in Nigeria." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Representative Bobby Rush noted the great interest of </p><p>the African-American community in events in Nigeria, given </p><p>long-standing historical and cultural ties.  Further, Rush </p><p>said he had many Nigerians living in his Chicago district. </p><p>He expressed his personal regret at the CODEL\'s delayed </p><p>arrival (the Hastert party came two days later than </p><p>originally scheduled), and its resulting inability to </p><p>worship with President Obasanjo on Easter Sunday at the </p><p>Villa Chapel.  Rush emphasized the USG\'s keen interest in a </p><p>more stable and democratic Nigeria, and he hoped that such </p><p>continental efforts as the Millenium African Program (MAP), </p><p>begun by President Mbeki of South Africa in consultation </p><p>with President Obasanjo, would bear fruit and enhance </p><p>African unity and progress. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  President Obasanjo replied with a gracious welcome to </p><p>Speaker Hastert and his colleagues.  He briefly observed </p><p>that the GON had "copied" key sections of the U.S. </p><p>Constitution and that its government styled itself on the </p><p>U.S. model in many ways.  Taking up Speaker Hastert\'s three </p><p>points in turn, Obasanjo said that "we are working hard" on </p><p>AGOA, and good progress was being made.  On the HIV/AIDS </p><p>front, Obasanjo said bluntly that HIV/AIDS was "a very </p><p>serious problem," and that "we pretend it is not only at </p><p>our peril."  He then elaborated on two major initiatives </p><p>undertaken by his government.  President Obasanjo said that </p><p>he had established a Cabinet-level body, composed of key </p><p>Ministers (Health, Youth, Education), chaired by himself </p><p>and co-chaired by the Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, to </p><p>oversee the GON response to the crisis.  His government </p><p>would also convoke an African HIV/AIDS Summit at the end of </p><p>April, patterned after the African Malaria Summit convened </p><p>in Abuja by the GON last year.  Obasanjo said that "the </p><p>technical efforts" needed to combat HIV/AIDS were clear, </p><p>and were well understood by his government, but that the </p><p>crucial task was to "raise the political and social </p><p>consciousness" of the Nigerian population. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Obasanjo said that anti-malarial efforts, an effective </p><p>HIV/AIDS campaign, and successful mass immunization efforts </p><p>for Nigerian children and adults were three strategic </p><p>components of his government\'s overall health program. </p><p>"Achievable, measurable results," he said, were the aim of </p><p>the GON in all three areas, and in the health sector as a </p><p>whole.  He then segued to a broad and very personal vision </p><p>of Nigeria\'s role in the region and in Africa.  "God allows </p><p>things to happen for a purpose," he said, in an oblique </p><p>comment on Nigeria\'s many problems and its many blessings. </p><p>Nigeria had a huge population, he said, a rich resource </p><p>base, and two of the five biggest rivers in Africa.  "God </p><p>must intend," he said, for Nigerians to use these resources </p><p>for the benefit of "ourselves and our neighbors."  Nigeria </p><p>sought a stable, united and harmonious polity at home, and </p><p>a dynamic and prosperous national economy. But, "if charity </p><p>begins at home, it must not end at home," he said.  "We </p><p>can\'t just be an oasis." </p><p>7.  President Obasanjo then recited the many areas in which </p><p>his government worked for peace in the region and in Africa </p><p>as a whole, and the many trips he has or will make to </p><p>further these goals: Nigeria\'s overall participation in </p><p>peace-keeping, both within ECOWAS/ECOMOG and in the UN; the </p><p>recent Extraordinary ECOWAS Summit on the Mano River </p><p>countries; Cote d\'Ivoire ("we are working to solidify </p><p>democracy," he said); Burkina Faso ("I am going there in </p><p>several weeks"); the DROC ("We will contribute troops, and </p><p>look for solutions"); Burundi ("We will also contribute </p><p>troops there as well,"); Sudan ("A slightly more </p><p>complicated situation," with IGAD and Egypt involved); </p><p>Zimbabwe ("Mbeki and I are urging restraint.  We both went </p><p>to Harare, and are also talking to the British"). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  President Obasanjo then summed up Nigeria\'s many </p><p>efforts at furthering peaceful and stable relations on the </p><p>continent.  "Nigeria," he said, "is almost at the center of </p><p>everything in Africa."  But, "we do not act alone." </p><p>Nigeria acted in concert with "people of like minds."  The </p><p>MAP, he said, was a reflection of his desire to work with </p><p>other leaders, such as Mbeki, to construct a new African </p><p>architecture of peace, stability and growth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Speaker Hastert responded with a "salute" to Nigerian </p><p>democracy and Nigerian peace-keeping efforts.  "Your </p><p>troops\' efforts have been outstanding, and we will work </p><p>with you," said the Speaker.  "Your walk back to democracy </p><p>has been impressive."  Hastert also praised Nigeria\'s </p><p>recent counter-narcotics efforts.  As a "great example" to </p><p>the continent, Nigeria would continue to receive strong USG </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  President Obasanjo closed the meeting with several </p><p>thoughts on his government\'s need to show results to the </p><p>Nigerian people.  "Democracy needs real meaning," he said. </p><p>"Freedom, yes, but also results."  Trade, investment, </p><p>growth, industrialization, these were the concrete means to </p><p>obtain those essential results.  In a brief and mild </p><p>allusion to Nigeria\'s long-standing international campaign </p><p>for debt relief and debt forgiveness, he said that the </p><p>"genesis" of Nigeria\'s debt was largely "immoral" (Comment: </p><p>meaning contracted my military governments and subsequently </p><p>wasted or stolen).  But Nigeria must be "forward looking," </p><p>he said.  "Let us make debt less important, and make trade </p><p>and growth more important." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  In an earlier and largely ceremonial meeting at the </p><p>National Assembly, Speaker Hastert and his nine colleagues </p><p>received a warm welcome from Nigerian Speaker Ghali Na\'Abba </p><p>and approximately seventy-five of his fellow House members. </p><p>After several exchanges of legislative good-fellowship, and </p><p>Na\'Abba\'s bravura introduction by name of all attending </p><p>House members in a crowded House conference room without </p><p>hesitation and without notes or prompting, Na\'Abba proposed </p><p>a joint US House - Nigerian House committee to further </p><p>mutual interests.  CODEL Hastert, Speaker Na\'Abba and his </p><p>colleagues then adjourned for a lunch, hosted by Na\'Abba. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  Comment.  The Nigerians, both executive and </p><p>legislative branches, warmly welcomed CODEL Hastert and </p><p>obligingly accommodated the two-day postponement of the </p><p>visit.  President Obasanjo particularly emphasized his </p><p>commitment to the struggle against HIV/AIDS, and Nigeria\'s </p><p>regional role as a peacekeeper.  He only gently touched on </p><p>debt relief, and made no great appeals for USG assistance. </p><p>This was a very good visit, by every measure.   End </p><p>comment. </p><p></p></div>
