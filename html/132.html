<p>S E C R E T ISLAMABAD 15762 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  IR IZ PK </p><p>SUBJECT:  IRAN/IRAQ WAR;  SITUATION IN TEHRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) STATE 227611 (B) ISLAMABAD 15582 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN FURTHER DISCUSSION JULY 22, ADDITIONAL SECRETARY </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SHAHARYAR KHAN WAS WILLING </p><p>TO EXPAND ON HIS INITIAL BRIEFING AND TO PROVIDE ANSWERS </p><p>TO A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RAISED IN REF A.  SHAHARYAR MADE </p><p>CLEAR THAT HIS COMMENTS WERE BASED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON </p><p>CONVERSATIONS HE HAD HAD WITH PAKISTANI EMBASSY OFFICIALS, </p><p>BUSINESSMEN AND MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES LIVING IN TEHRAN. </p><p>HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN THERE FOR ONLY FIVE DAYS AND HAD </p><p>MOVED AROUND THE CITY VERY LITTLE BUT, IN GENERAL WHAT HE </p><p>HAD SEEN SEEMED TO BEAR OUT WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT THE PRIVATE PAKISTANI COMMUNITY IN TEHRAN IS </p><p>LARGE, HAS PRETTY GOOD ACCESS, AND HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR </p><p>A LONG TIME. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SHAHARYAR STATED THAT HIS INITIAL COMMENTS ON THE </p><p>GROWING DISENCHANTMENT OF THE POPULATION WERE MEANT TO </p><p>ENCOMPASS THE LOWER CLASSES.  TO HIM, THERE WOULD BE </p><p>NOTHING NEW ABOUT DISAFFECTION AMONG THE BOURGEOIS </p><p>ELEMENT; WHAT IS NEW IS THAT THE LOWER CLASSES, BOTH IN </p><p>TEHRAN AND THE COUNTRYSIDE ARE INVOLVED.  WHEN I ASKED HIM </p><p>WHY THIS WAS OCCURRING, HE POINTED TO THE CONSCRIPTION OF </p><p>12-13 YEAR OLDS AS THE MAJOR FACTOR, WITH PARENTS NOT </p><p>BEING WILLING TO ACCEPT THE NECESSITY OF SUCH A MOVE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  HE HIMSELF HAD NOT BEEN OUTSIDE TEHRAN ON THIS TRIP. </p><p>HOWEVER, PAKISTAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS AND PRIVATE CITIZENS </p><p>CAN MOVE ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE WITH FEWER RESTRICTIONS </p><p>THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER FOREIGNERS.  (AS EVIDENCE, HE </p><p>RECOUNTED AN ANECDOTE IN WHICH THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR </p><p>WAS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON TO HIS SKIING DESTINATION AFTER </p><p>HIS SCANDINAVIAN COLLEAGUES HAD BEEN TURNED BACK AT A LOCA </p><p>CHECKPOINT.)  THESE PAKISTANI SOURCES ARE IN AGREEMENT, </p><p>HE SAID, THAT THE ORDINARY PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY DIS- </p><p>ENCHANTED WITH THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ACCORDING TO SHAHARYAR, THE "MODERATE" CLERICAL GROUP </p><p>IS LED BY RAFSANJANI, PRESIDENT KHAMENEI AND FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER VELAYATI.  HE DOUBTED THAT THEY HAD CONVEYED THEI </p><p>VIEWS ON THE WAR DIRECTLY TO ANY PAKISTANI OFFICIALS BUT </p><p>SAID THAT IT WAS RELATIVELY COMMON FOR IRANIAN THIRD </p><p>PARTIES TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR VIEWS TO THE PAKISTAN </p><p>EMBASSY.  HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE LEADERS HAD YET </p><p>OPENLY DEBATED ANY DIFFERENCES OF VIEW ON THE WAR WITH </p><p>THE AYATOLLAH KHOMENEI NOR DID HE THINK THAT KHOMENEI WAS </p><p>LIKELY TO BE PERSUADED BY SUCH A DEBATE.  AS TO ANY </p><p>"MIDDLE GROUND," IN SHAHARYAR\'S VIEW NO ONE IN IRAN, </p><p>INCLUDING KHOMENEI, WOULD SERIOUSLY HOLD OUT FOR THE </p><p>ELIMINATION OF THE BAATH PARTY AS A PRECONDITION FOR ENDIN </p><p>THE WAR EVEN THOUGH THIS HAS BEEN A PUBLIC IRANIAN DEMAND. </p><p>HE RESTATED THAT WHAT THE MODERATES ARE LOOKING AT IS A </p><p>SOLUTION WHICH WOULD NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE THE DEPARTURE </p><p>OF SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM POWER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  SHAHARYAR WAS RELUCTANT TO MAKE ANY ESTIMATE AS TO </p><p>WHETHER ONE GROUP OR ANOTHER AMONG THE CLERGY IS MOVING </p><p>INTO THE ASCENDANT OR ABOUT THE POSSIBLE TIME BEYOND WHICH </p><p>THE PRESENT SITUATION WOULD NOT ENDURE.  HE DID SAY THAT </p><p>HIS OFFICIAL AND NON-OFFICIAL PAKISTANI CONTACTS GENERALLY </p><p>THOUGHT THAT ONE YEAR WAS ABOUT AS LONG AS THE PRESENT </p><p>SITUATION COULD CONTINUE WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT DOING </p><p>SOMETHING TO RELIEVE THE GENERAL DISCONTENT BUT QUICKLY </p><p>ADDED THAT HE HAD HEARD TOO MANY PREDICTIONS ABOUT IRAN </p><p>IN THE PAST FOR HIM TO GIVE THEM MUCH CREDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  SHAHARYAR SAID THAT FOREIGN MINISTER VELAYATI IS </p><p>ANXIOUS TO VISIT ISLAMABAD PRIOR TO THE NAM MEETING IN </p><p>HARARE AND THAT DATES IN THE SECOND OR THIRD WEEK OF </p><p>AUGUST HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED (BUT NOT YET NAILED DOWN). </p><p>ACCORDING TO HIM, THE GOI IS CONCERNED THAT IRAQ MAY BE </p><p>HAVING SOME SUCCESS IN NAM CIRCLES ON A RESOLUTION THAT </p><p>IRAN WOULD FIND ONESIDED AND IS ANXIOUS TO CONSULT WITH </p><p>THE GOP ON THIS ISSUE.  SHAHARYAR EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO PASS ON ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT IRAN IN THE </p><p>FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MCCARTHY </p><p></p></div>
