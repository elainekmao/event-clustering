<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 004237 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR, EUR/SE, EUR/PD, NEA/PD, DRL </p><p>JCS PASS J-5/CDR S. WRIGHT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH PRESS SLAMS US DETENTION OF TURKISH </p><p>SPECIAL FORCES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4232 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Public reaction and rhetoric about the Turkish SF </p><p>detained in Iraq continues to mount in Turkey as evidenced by </p><p>increasingly large demonstrations  at our missions and more </p><p>vociferous statements to the  press by government  officials. </p><p> Headlines in July 6 major Turkish newspapers -- "The Ugly </p><p>American," (Milliyet) "What Kind of Strategic Partner?" </p><p>(Radikal) reflect the overall tone of the local press.  Much </p><p>of the anger is directed against Col. William Mayville, whom </p><p>most assume to have led the US operation in Suleymaniye.  A </p><p>front-page headline in "Hurriyet," Turkey\'s </p><p>largest-circulation daily, reads "let this man know his </p><p>place."  "Sabah" details a list of "evidence" that Col. </p><p>Mayville has systematically favored the Kurds at the expense </p><p>of Turkmen and Arabs in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Many press articles characterize the US action as an </p><p>attempt to force all Turkish troops out of northern Iraq, and </p><p>a "Hurriyet" columnist claims that all Turkish SF have been </p><p>asked by the US to leave within 3 months.  Most also </p><p>speculate that US forces relied on PUK intelligence sources </p><p>to justify the raid, and left-leaning "Cumhuriyet" suggests </p><p>Kurdish groups are "provoking" the US into taking actions </p><p>that are "dragging Northern Iraq toward instability."  A </p><p>Washington correspondent for "Sabah" argues the operation was </p><p>carried out without the prior knowledge of the State </p><p>Department, the White House, or senior US civilian </p><p>authorities in Iraq.  Prominent "Radikal" columnist Murat </p><p>Yetkin, however, claims that the US delay in giving a full </p><p>explanation of the incident leads to the conclusion that the </p><p>action was part of "US state policy" rather than a local </p><p>military initiative. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. All papers carry statements by opposition party leaders </p><p>condemning the detentions and blasting the AKP government for </p><p>"weakness" or negligence" for failing to prevent them. </p><p>Articles claim that the Secretary confirmed to FM Gul that 24 </p><p>Turks had been taken to Baghdad and were still under </p><p>detention.  The Secretary reportedly told Gul that he hoped </p><p>the situation could be resolved by Sunday evening.  Gul told </p><p>the press that he viewed the incident as a "local event" of </p><p>which Washington "was not informed." The FM also reaffirmed </p><p>his intention to visit Washington in coming days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Leftist Labor Party leader and troublemaker Dogu Perincek </p><p>continued to stir anti-American sentiment.  Perincek </p><p>reportedly commented on Turkish television that "it would be </p><p>good" if Turkey were to take some American officers prisoner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
