<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002122 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, EFIN, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DELTA CORPORATION:  FINANCING ITS OWN INTERESTS </p><p>WHILE APPEARING BENEVOLENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  In a new development, local powerhouse Delta </p><p>Corporation (which, coincidentally, owns several breweries) </p><p>has reportedly announced a Zim $10 billion initiative </p><p>(approximately US $14.5 million at the parallel rate) whereby </p><p>it will loan inputs for the production of maize, sorghum and </p><p>malting barley to selected farmers. However, while the </p><p>publicity has cast Delta as a solid corporate citizen doing </p><p>its part to uphold the GOZ\'s programs, Delta\'s self-interests </p><p>are driving the deal.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. According to published reports, Delta Corporation has </p><p>announced a joint venture with the GOZ whereby Delta will </p><p>loan the equivalent of Zim $10 billion over two growing </p><p>seasons to farmers in the form of agricultural inputs.  These </p><p>inputs will reportedly support the production of 70,000 </p><p>tonnes of maize, 60,000 tonnes of malting barley, and 20,000 </p><p>tonnes of sorghum annually.  While this has been met with </p><p>great fanfare by Minister of Lands, Agriculture and </p><p>Resettlement Joseph Made, as well as Minister for Information </p><p>and Publicity Jonathan Moyo, as evidence of Delta\'s support </p><p>of agrarian reforms, the details of the transaction give a </p><p>different gloss. </p><p> </p><p>3. Delta subsidiaries include United Bottlers (Coca-Cola), </p><p>National Breweries, and Chibuku, which produces the local </p><p>opaque beer known as "shake-shake."  According to published </p><p>accounts of the deal, the inputs and support provided by </p><p>Delta "will be treated as loans to be netted off against </p><p>final prices."   Delta further reserves the rights to manage </p><p>the program and select which farmers will receive the loans. </p><p>Additionally, while the farmers will forward all maize </p><p>produced to the Grain Marketing Board (GMB), which by law </p><p>controls all movements, sales and purchases of maize within </p><p>the country, Delta has requested an "undertaking and </p><p>guarantee" that for as long as maize remains a specified </p><p>commodity under the control of the GMB, Delta will be </p><p>guaranteed its quota -- with only the surplus to be </p><p>distributed to other buyers.  If this deal takes place as </p><p>agreed, Delta will thus have provided loans to selected </p><p>farmers (with their loan repaid by skimming off the first cut </p><p>from the produce) who will grow the agro inputs required for </p><p>the operations of Delta\'s subsidiaries. </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment.  One local economist notes that this is actually </p><p>an expansion of a previous program which Delta has been </p><p>operating for the past 12-15 years.  Historically, Delta has </p><p>preferred to grant malting barley, hops, and grain inputs to </p><p>"captive farmers," who then provide inputs for Delta\'s </p><p>various breweries.  According to this economist, the dollar </p><p>value of the program has increased, but this has much more to </p><p>do with inflation than with increased hectarage. </p><p>Additionally, he believes that Delta is taking the </p><p>opportunity to "make a virtue out of a necessity" by publicly </p><p>announcing the program in this fashion.  While it is true </p><p>that the increase of maize inputs is a new initiative, </p><p>Delta\'s motivations are based much less on altruism and more </p><p>on protecting its bottom line.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
