(C) Polchief delivered reftel demarche on cash </p><p>assistance for WFP provision of Iraq foodstuff to </p><p>MFA Assistant U/S for Political Affairs Abdullah </p><p>Rashid Al-Nuaimi on March 19.  Al-Nuaimi indicated </p><p>that visiting WFP officials had held a meeting </p><p>earlier in the day with the UAE Foreign Ministry to </p><p>discuss the expeditious establishment of a WFP </p><p>regional office in Dubai.  The Emiratis have </p><p>authorized the establishment of the office and Al- </p><p>Nuaimi believes it will be opened almost </p><p>immediately in order to facilitate the movement of </p><p>foodstuffs to Iraq.
