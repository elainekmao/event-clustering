(C) Summary: Returning from the political wilderness, </p><p>Islamist former Prime Minister Erbakan is bent on using </p><p>Saadet Party and the Iraq issue to hammer the ruling AK Party </p><p>and P.M. Erdogan, a former Erbakan protege.  It is unlikely </p><p>the septuagenarian Erbakan can reclaim his once dominant </p><p>place in a political movement now badly fractured and </p><p>represented in part by both AK and Saadet.  But the wily </p><p>Erbakan "Hoca" ("Teacher") is already causing problems for </p><p>AK, and may eventually recruit enough disaffected AK M.P.s to </p><p>form a parliamentary group and mount a vocal alternative for </p><p>core AK supporters in Turkey\'s increasingly charged political </p><p>environment.  How Saadet approaches Turkey\'s problematic </p><p>relations with its own Kurdish citizens will be a key to </p><p>success or failure.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>The Teacher </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Erbakan, founder of the Islamist "Milli Gorus" </p><p>(National View) Movement, is just coming off a five year </p><p>court ban from formal politics (February 1998-2003).  This </p><p>resulted from what Turks call the military\'s "post-modern" </p><p>coup d\'etat against his Refah Party-led government in 1997 </p><p>and Refah\'s subsequent court-mandated closure.  Even so, </p><p>Erbakan quietly continued to exert de facto control over both </p><p>the now-banned Fazilet Party and, subsequently, Saadet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Oguzhan Asilturk, Erbakan\'s right-hand man, asserted </p><p>to us March 12 that Erbakan is preparing officially to join </p><p>Saadet March 21, and to assume the leadership at the Party </p><p>conference in May.  Nevertheless, Erbakan is not yet in the </p><p>clear.  First, as Asilturk called it, the Turkish "Deep </p><p>State" -- principally the military -- will try to keep </p><p>Erbakan under tight control.  Second, Erbakan was separately </p><p>convicted and banned for spreading religious hatred (Penal </p><p>Code Art. 312) but never served his sentence, which </p><p>complicates his situation.  Diyarbakir State Security Court </p><p>No. 1 has denied Erbakan\'s petition to expunge his criminal </p><p>record in the wake of constitutional amendments </p><p>decriminalizing some of the provisions under which he was </p><p>banned -- a step that Erdogan must complete in order to </p><p>reassert fully his political rights.  In its holding </p><p>published March 19, the court ruled pursuant to legal </p><p>technicalities that Erbakan is ineligible to return until </p><p>Jan. 3 2004.  Most observers expect Erbakan eventually will </p><p>win on appeal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Opportunity: Iraq </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Many Turkish pundits wrote off Saadet and its greying </p><p>leadership as the younger, more dynamic Erdogan and his AK </p><p>Party -- which emerged after Fazilet\'s banning as a breakaway </p><p>faction eager to replace Erbakan at the top of the Islamist </p><p>movement, not only for political reasons but also to take </p><p>their share of the sizeable income stream that Erbakan </p><p>benefits from -- headed for a big win in the November 2002 </p><p>national elections.  More recently, however, the Iraq debate </p><p>has intensified ideological and personality strains within </p><p>the AK parliamentary group.  With the AK government\'s March 1 </p><p>failure to pass a parliamentary resolution authorizing </p><p>deployment of U.S. troops through Turkey (ref A) -- and with </p><p>nearly 100 AK M.P.s voting against the government -- those </p><p>internecine conflicts have become even more visible. </p><p>According to several sources, a rejectionist appeal from </p><p>Erbakan to his sympathizers in the AK group played a role in </p><p>the resolution\'s defeat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Saadet seeks to exploit AK\'s divisions by having </p><p>Erbakan articulate his time-tested message, designed to: (1) </p><p>appeal explicitly to the more radical Islamic sentiments in </p><p>the AK group by declaring that a U.S.-led war against Iraq is </p><p>merely the latest Western imperialist "Crusade" in the lands </p><p>of Islam; and (2) implicitly suggest that those in AK who </p><p>support the USG, including Erdogan, are "Americanists" and de </p><p>facto religious apostates -- a serious charge among the </p><p>religiously-inclined.  Some Erdogan supporters -- notably </p><p>Korkut Ozal, who failed in his own bid to wrest the Islamist </p><p>crown from Erbakan in the 1970s -- have downplayed to us </p><p>Erbakan\'s return and his political prospects.  Nevertheless, </p><p>they admit that the Hoca is by far Erdogan\'s superior both as </p><p>a pragmatic tactician and in knowledge of how the Kemalist </p><p>State works -- and that he thus "can cause problems" for AK. </p><p>As one senior columnist asserted to us Mar. 19, "if Refah had </p><p>been in AK\'s place the troop deployment issue would have been </p><p>handled far more smoothly.  These AK guys are like political </p><p>adolescents" compared to Erbakan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The overwhelming majority of AK M.P.s cut their political </p><p>teeth in Erbakan\'s movement, on occasion still privately </p><p>refer unapologetically to their past affiliation with the </p><p>National View, and evince considerable sympathy for their </p><p>former leader even though for tactical political reasons they </p><p>have gravitated to Erdogan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- After the March 1 debacle, mainstream "Hurriyet" columnist </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever confided to us that Erdogan is fearful of </p><p>being outmaneuvered by Saadet on the Islamist flank.  AK M.P. </p><p>Emin Sirin, deputy chairman of the Parliament\'s Foreign </p><p>Affairs Committee and formerly Fazilet\'s public relations </p><p>adviser, volunteered on March 4 that "up to 20" AK M.P.s </p><p>might switch to Saadet, enough to constitute a formal </p><p>parliamentary group.  "Sabah" trumpeted AK\'s "Fear of </p><p>Erbakan" in its March 16 headlines, and reported former </p><p>Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis\' assertion that 15-20 AK M.P.s </p><p>could resign from the party in the event the AK government </p><p>submits another troop deployment resolution.  Ulsever and </p><p>others privately put the potential figure in the 40-plus </p><p>range and even higher. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Asilturk told us March 12 that parties including the right </p><p>of center True Path (DYP) of Mehmet Agar, with three seats in </p><p>Parliament, are "secretly" negotiating with a number of AK </p><p>M.P.s.  Saadet, Asilturk avowed, has no need to do any real </p><p>advance work, but would be open to giving AK defectors a </p><p>home.  His Saadet colleagues were even more assertive in </p><p>meetings with us March 14.  They claimed erstwhile AKers will </p><p>flock to Saadet "once the bombs start dropping." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Saadet, AK, and the Kurds </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Given the emphasis on war and Turkish fears of a </p><p>possible independent Kurdish state in N. Iraq, how Saadet </p><p>handles Turkey\'s own Kurdish problem will be key to whether </p><p>Erbakan can reemerge as a strong political force.  Islamists </p><p>have long criticized the Kemalist State for its "racist" </p><p>policies (ref B) toward the Kurds.  In a bid to win Kurdish </p><p>votes, Islamists have long justified expanding Kurdish </p><p>cultural and regional rights, in part by reference to Quranic </p><p>passages celebrating God-created differences among men and to </p><p>what they boast was Ottoman-era political "decentralization." </p><p> At the same time, Erbakan and his crew have long been wary </p><p>of nationalist ideologies, which they see as a challenge to </p><p>an "Islamic" political identity.  As a result, the </p><p>Turk-dominated Saadet, like its Fazilet and Refah </p><p>predecessors, opposes the emergence of an independent Kurdish </p><p>state as both a physical and ideological manifestation of </p><p>Western imperialism -- and thereby defines the limit of its </p><p>rapprochement with radical Kurdish nationalist elements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Erbakan\'s ideological focus on the "ummet" -- community of </p><p>the Islamic faithful-- as opposed to ethnic nationalism has </p><p>long appealed to Kurds and others who have yet to come to </p><p>terms with Ataturk\'s secularist "Turkish" revolution. </p><p>According to Abdurrahman Anik, formerly the Refah Mayor of </p><p>Bingol and now an AK M.P., a basic respect for Erbakan is </p><p>still evident among religious elements throughout the Kurdish </p><p>southeast. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- While many Kurdish activists criticize Erbakan for failing </p><p>to follow through on his commitments to the Kurds, they </p><p>privately express their ideological preference for Erbakan </p><p>over the more "Turkish nationalist" Erdogan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Erdogan apparently is aware of this image and is </p><p>taking steps to improve his position among Kurds and thus to </p><p>head off Saadet\'s efforts to hive off M.P.s.  Two former </p><p>Refah Kurds -- long-time contacts with impeccable Kurdish </p><p>nationalist and Islamic credentials -- have separately told </p><p>us that Erdogan has directly called them to solicit their </p><p>views on the situation in Turkey\'s predominantly Kurdish </p><p>Southeast and the impending conflict in Iraq.  One of these </p><p>sources, who also has strong political ties to Barzani, </p><p>speculated to us that Erdogan is also interested in using </p><p>well-connected Turkish Kurds as Refah had -- as </p><p>intermediaries to Barzani and others. (Note: In the March 18 </p><p>edition of pro-AK "Yeni Safak," columnist Ahmet Tasgetiren </p><p>calls on Erdogan to push a package of pro-Kurdish reforms to </p><p>end-run "international power centers" trying to play the </p><p>"Iraq card against Turkey." End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The pro-Barzani Kurd noted that many of the AK members who </p><p>voted against the Government\'s March 1 troop deployment </p><p>resolution were Kurds worried that a war in Iraq would bring </p><p>the Turkish State down on their heads -- echoing points made </p><p>to us separately by Kurdish Saadet officials on March 14 (ref </p><p>B).  Nevertheless, he said that most AK Kurds will stay put, </p><p>knowing that Erdogan is their best chance politically. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The source also asserted that prior to the special March 9 </p><p>elections in Siirt province that brought Erdogan to </p><p>Parliament, AK cut a deal with the pro-Kurdish (and </p><p>just-banned) HADEP for support against the opposition CHP, </p><p>which resulted in Erdogan getting votes in Kurdish </p><p>nationalist villages he otherwise would have had to write </p><p>off.  In return, AK agreed: (1) to end Ocalan\'s recent lack </p><p>of access to his lawyers; and (2) to prepare for a post-Iraq </p><p>war wide-ranging amnesty for PKK fighters still hiding in the </p><p>mountains.  (Note: As reported in ref C, HADEP formally </p><p>boycotted the Siirt election; as reported ref D, however, </p><p>HADEP admitted to us privately their preference for AK over </p><p>CHP regarding Kurdish issues; ref. E notes the break in </p><p>Ocalan\'s isolation.  Saadet and HADEP had briefly but </p><p>seriously considered entering a de facto alliance for the </p><p>November 2002 election.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Implications </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Saadet is clearly enjoying AK\'s discomfort and appears </p><p>energized and hopeful that, after four decades in politics </p><p>and one stint as P.M., Erbakan will yet again make a mark on </p><p>Turkey\'s fractious political system.  With talk of yet </p><p>another parliamentary resolution in the air, we expect </p><p>Erbakan to do everything he can to promote squabbling in the </p><p>AK ranks and failure on the floor of parliament.  The </p><p>benefits to Saadet from another such blow to AK would be </p><p>considerable. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
