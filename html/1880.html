(U) Summary: On July 31, Ambassador, INS District </p><p>Director INS/Rome, INS OIC/Accra, and Lagos Econoff </p><p>attended a roundtable sponsored by Minister of Aviation </p><p>Kema Chikwe to discuss the problems associated with the </p><p>Nigeria Airways/South African Airways direct flight to </p><p>New York City. GON participants expressed concern about </p><p>reports of narcotics seizures at New York\'s JFK Airport, </p><p>and the continuing problem of "malafide" passengers. </p><p>The GON presented a number of proposals meant to address </p><p>these problems including the establishment of a GON </p><p>anti-fraud unit targeting malafide passengers and the </p><p>placement of a magistrate\'s court within the airport. </p><p>INS agreed to assist the GON with its efforts.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>ROUNDTABLE EXAMINES SAA/NA\'S "MALAFIDE" PROBLEM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Minister of Aviation, Kema Chikwe led a </p><p>roundtable discussion on problems associated with the </p><p>SAA/NA service to JFK.  Attendees included GON Aviation </p><p>Ministry officials, Immigration, and Customs officials, </p><p>Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) Chairman </p><p>Alhaji Bello Lafiagi, the NDLEA Zonal Commander for </p><p>Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Federal </p><p>Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) Managing Director </p><p>Sule Ozenua, and a representative of the National </p><p>Security Advisor\'s office. The Minister of Internal </p><p>Affairs who oversees the Immigration Service was to co- </p><p>chair the discussion, but a last minute change prevented </p><p>his attendance.  INS District Director Gregory Smith </p><p>first briefed GON officials on INS observations about </p><p>the SAA/NA flight.  According to Smith, INS records </p><p>indicate that approximately 70 passengers have been </p><p>"turned around" from JFK since the flight commenced in </p><p>February 2001.  Smith stated that ninety percent of </p><p>these "malafide" passengers boarded in Lagos, and ninety </p><p>percent were Nigerian nationals. The high incidence of </p><p>malafide passengers, Smith explained, poses a </p><p>significant financial burden for the airlines in the </p><p>form of fines, as well as an image problem for both the </p><p>carriers and Nigeria. The resulting negative perception </p><p>will make the GON goal of attracting a U.S. carrier to </p><p>Nigeria a difficult task. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Smith pointed out that in the past year INS has </p><p>provided training to GON security agencies, Nigerian </p><p>Immigration, and airline check-in staff on approximately </p><p>seven occasions. (Comment:  In addition, the Congen </p><p>Anti-Fraud Unit has also provided training on a number </p><p>of times.  End Comment.)  Despite this effort the problem and </p><p>number of malafide passengers continue unabated. Moreover, </p><p>malafide passengers stopped at the boarding gate have their </p><p>documents confiscated, and are usually free to return and </p><p>just try again another day.   Smith reiterated that other </p><p>factors, such as malfeasance and insufficient deterrence, are </p><p>at play </p><p>(Ref A).  To illustrate his point, Smith presented several </p><p>examples of altered U.S. documents intercepted and </p><p>confiscated by INS at the boarding gate area of MMIA.  The </p><p>troubling point, Smith emphasized, was that the "would be" </p><p>passengers apparently utilized these documents to pass </p><p>through a Nigerian Immigration checkpoint prior to reaching </p><p>the gate area.  Two of the U.S. passports presented were </p><p>significantly damaged/altered and had identifying data wiped </p><p>out. They should not have passed Nigerian Immigration </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>GON OFFICIALS PRESENT COUNTER-FRAUD PROPOSALS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Minister Chikwe responded that President Obasanjo </p><p>was aware of and concerned about the reported narcotics </p><p>seizures and malafide passengers, and she described several </p><p>proposals she had discussed with the President.  One </p><p>proposal, put forward by the President himself, was to </p><p>establish a magistrate\'s court within the airport to try </p><p>offenses such as utilizing fraudulent documents and </p><p>harassment. (Note: The harassment the Minister mentioned </p><p>apparently described two types, that by "touts" and that </p><p>deemed carried out by GON officials.  "Touts" are unemployed </p><p>individuals searching for opportunities to make a few Naira, </p><p>usually with threats of intimidation.  An example of this </p><p>would be a "tout" hired to assist a passenger to move from </p><p>the rear to the front of a line. End Note.)  Other GON </p><p>agencies present at the roundtable seemed unaware of this </p><p>proposal and it was pointed out that a court, with </p><p>jurisdiction over the airport, already existed.  NDLEA </p><p>officials reiterated that narcotics cases can only be tried </p><p>in a Federal High Court.  Despite the contradictory </p><p>viewpoints, Minister Chikwe opined that a magistrate\'s court </p><p>was needed within the airport facility if for no other reason </p><p>than to serve as a deterrent for minor crimes, such as </p><p>utilizing fraudulent documents.  Such a court facility would </p><p>offer rapid justice and therefore deter this type of crime. </p><p>Chikwe indicated that she would discuss this proposal with </p><p>Lagos State Governor Tinubu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The Minister described a second proposal involving the </p><p>posting of government lawyers to the airport to ensure the </p><p>protection of passengers\' rights. This proposal would </p><p>address, she said, Ministry concerns regarding accusations by </p><p>travelers of extortion and harassment by GON officials. The </p><p>Minister\'s third proposal was an expression of GON support </p><p>for any USG </p><p>assistance and training that can be offered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) After Minister Chikwe described these preliminary </p><p>proposals, other suggestions were raised during the course of </p><p>the roundtable discussion. Chikwe dictated that FAAN would </p><p>begin to provide additional security at boarding gate areas </p><p>to prevent "would be" malafide passengers from intimidating </p><p>airline staff. The Minister stated that FAAN security </p><p>personnel should be on hand and react as appropriate when </p><p>passengers </p><p>denied boarding become unruly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>INS TRAINING KEY TO GON THINKING </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) GON officials requested additional INS training for </p><p>airline personnel, check-in staff, Nigerian Immigration, and </p><p>various GON security agencies. (Comment:  An INL-funded, </p><p>Department of Justice, International Criminal Investigative </p><p>Training Assistance Program (ICITAP), involving 40 Nigerian </p><p>Immigration officers is planned for late August.  In </p><p>addition, INS has agreed to provide additional training for </p><p>Nigerian </p><p>Immigration in the future, and to other GON security </p><p>agencies, as appropriate.  End Comment.)  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>informed Chikwe that the proposed Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding, establishing guidelines for a USG presence at </p><p>MMIA, was presently under review by the State Department. </p><p>(Reftels A and D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) The roundtable recommended that a Special </p><p>Anti-Fraud Unit be established by the Nigerian Immigration </p><p>Service to operate at the airport at both the boarding gates </p><p>and the regular immigration checkpoints.  INS agreed to </p><p>support and train such a "core" unit, with the understanding </p><p>that its members will be held accountable and would undergo </p><p>background </p><p>checks. Members of the unit will be directed to arrest (and </p><p>hopefully prosecute) passengers presenting fraudulent </p><p>documents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Comment: The convening of this roundtable by the </p><p>Minister of Aviation, with the reguired attendance of a </p><p>number of GON security agencies, suggests that at the GON, at </p><p>the highest levels, is seeking solutions to the problems </p><p>arising from the SAA/NA service to JFK. The GON is obviously </p><p>worried about recent developments.  Unfortunately, as </p><p>evidenced during the roundtable, a lack of coordination and </p><p>communication among GON agencies still exists.  However, a </p><p>meaningful discussion was held and useful proposals were </p><p>suggested from all sides. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) Comment Cont.: The proposals suggested during the </p><p>roundtable address some of the factors that allow the problem </p><p>of malafide passengers to continue unabated.  To date, there </p><p>has been little or no deterrence to such activity. Whether it </p><p>is the creation of a magistrate\'s court that expeditiously </p><p>tries malafide passengers, or the arrest and detention of </p><p>malafides by the Nigerian Immigration Service, both steps </p><p>suggest movement in the right direction. Also, the Minister\'s </p><p>tasking of FAAN to increase security at boarding gate areas </p><p>could help alleviate concerns of airline staff regarding </p><p>intimidation by passengers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Comment Cont.: The burden of document verification </p><p>now rests completely upon the airlines operating from Murtala </p><p>Mohammed International Airport. Reports indicate that </p><p>corruption is a widespread problem in both the Nigerian </p><p>Immigration and Customs Services, and these reports come from </p><p>sister GON security agencies. In the Embassy\'s view, the </p><p>proposal to train a small group of Nigerian Immigration </p><p>officers to fill the void of effective document verification </p><p>at MMIA is both logical and necessary.  Training and support </p><p>could be focused on this core group, with the understanding </p><p>that the GON will hold unit members accountable for their </p><p>actions.  For maximum impact and effectiveness, these </p><p>officers could concentrate their efforts at the boarding </p><p>gates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Comment Cont.: Experience has demonstrated that the </p><p>presence of one USG Anti-Fraud or INS officer at the boarding </p><p>gate results in passenger turnaround numbers going from </p><p>several a flight to zero.  The best substitute for a USG or </p><p>similar (UK, German) presence is a trained (and trustworthy) </p><p>Nigerian Immigration presence, but one which is strictly held </p><p>accountable for proffesional performance. With high level GON </p><p>attention, the establishment of an immigration unit as </p><p>proposed, with USG assistance, may be feasible. We are </p><p>certain that the proposals put forward by Chikwe have the </p><p>full backing of President Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Action Request: Mission welcomes the INS offer of </p><p>an extended TDY presence in Lagos and reguests that INS </p><p>approve the proposal to coordinate with GON officials to </p><p>establish and train a Special Anti-Fraud Unit within the </p><p>Nigerian Immigration Service.  Mission would also appreciate </p><p>any update from the Department on the status of the proposed </p><p>MOU (Reftels A, B, C, D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. This message was drafted after the departure of INS </p><p>Director Gregory Smith. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
