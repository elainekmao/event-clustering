<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HANOI 001666 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/03/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT: PROSPECTS FOR LEADERSHIP STABILITY IN VIETNAM </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HANOI 1517 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RAYMOND BURGHARDT, </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01666  020959Z </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY.  A PARTY PLENUM AND NEW NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL DECIDE ON </p><p>SEVERAL NEW KEY LEADERS.  WHILE SOME PERSONNEL </p><p>JOCKEYING PROBABLY CONTINUES, WE DETECT FEW, IF ANY, </p><p>GENUINE DEBATES ON POLICY DIRECTION.  WE ANTICIPATE </p><p>THAT THE NEW LINE-UP WILL CONTINUE TO BE LARGELY </p><p>COLLECTIVE AND PRAGMATIC IN DECISION-MAKING AS WELL AS </p><p>GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF ECONOMIC REFORM AND DIPLOMATIC </p><p>INTEGRATION INTO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO BUILD ON THE POSITIVE </p><p>MOMENTUM IN BILATERAL TIES WITH AN ACTIVE SERIES OF </p><p>HIGH LEVEL VISITS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS OVER THE NEXT YEAR </p><p>AND BEYOND.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE EXPECTED SIXTH PLENUM OF THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE OF THE NINTH CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>OF VIETNAM (CPV) JULY 4-15 AND THE OPENING OF THE 11TH </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA) ON JULY 19 WILL LEAD TO A NEW </p><p>ROUND OF SENIOR LEADERSHIP SHIFTS WITHIN THE GVN </p><p>(REFTEL).  AMONG THE LIKELY CHANGES WILL BE ONE OR TWO </p><p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTERS, AS MANY AS HALF A DOZEN </p><p>MINISTERS, POSSIBLY THE SUPREME PROCURATOR, AND SEVERAL </p><p>NA COMMITTEE CHIEFS, INCLUDING FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND </p><p>ECONOMIC AND BUDGET AFFAIRS.  THE PRESIDENT, PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ARE </p><p>EXPECTED TO WIN RE-ELECTION EASILY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  MUCH OF THE BACK-DOOR BARGAINING ON PERSONNEL </p><p>SHIFTS HAS PROBABLY ALREADY CONCLUDED, WITH THE PLENUM </p><p>EXPECTED TO GIVE ITS FINAL BLESSING IN PRIVATE TO THE </p><p>NEW SLATE AND THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AFTER TOKEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01666  020959Z </p><p>DISCUSSION, TO RATIFY THESE CHOICES OBEDIENTLY.  UNLIKE </p><p>THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THEN-GENERAL SECRETARY LE KHA PHIEU </p><p>AND EVENTUAL GENERAL SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH IN THE </p><p>RUN-UP TO THE 2001 NINTH PARTY CONGRESS, HOWEVER, THESE </p><p>PERSONNEL DECISIONS APPEAR TO HAVE VERY LITTLE TO DO </p><p>WITH IDEOLOGY OR SETTING A DIFFERENT POLICY COURSE FOR </p><p>VIETNAM OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS ESSENTIALLY MADE THE </p><p>BOTTOM LINE CHOICES IN FAVOR OF EXPANDED ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORM, HIGHER PRIORITY TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRADE, MAINTENANCE OF DOMESTIC STABILITY, </p><p>AND CONTINUED INTEGRATION INTO THE REGIONAL AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.   WE SEE NO ONE ON THE HORIZON </p><p>WITHIN THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP OR POTENTIAL LEADERSHIP </p><p>RANKS WHO IS STAKING AN OPPOSITION TO THIS POLICY </p><p>FRAMEWORK OR WHO MIGHT WISH TO BACKTRACK ON NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS PRIORITIES.  INDEED, SOME OF THE POTENTIAL </p><p>WINNERS FROM THE LEADERSHIP SWEEPSTAKES, SUCH AS </p><p>CURRENT MINISTER OF TRADE VU KHOAN (A LIKELY DPM) OR HO </p><p>CHI MINH CITY PARTY CHIEF NGUYEN MINH TRIET (STILL A </p><p>DARK HORSE CANDIDATE AS DPM) MIGHT SEEK FURTHER TO </p><p>ENERGIZE THE GVN\'S ECONOMIC REFORM PROCESS ONCE IN </p><p>OFFICE.  NO ONE IN SIGHT, HOWEVER, APPEARS TO BE </p><p>ADVOCATING FOR SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL REFORM, APART FROM </p><p>AN ONGOING IF SEEMINGLY STERILE CAMPAIGN TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>"GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY" AND NUMEROUS SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS </p><p>(INCLUDING WITH USG SUPPORT) ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RULE </p><p>OF LAW. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE CPV AND GVN LEADERSHIP HAS WEATHERED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01666  020959Z </p><p>NUMEROUS CHALLENGES SINCE NATIONAL UNIFICATION IN 1975, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE DARK DAYS OF ISOLATION AND ECONOMIC </p><p>DISASTER IN THE 1980\'S AND THE FALL-OUT FROM THE 1997 </p><p>ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS.  WHAT WE ARE LEFT WITH IS NOT A </p><p>GENERATION OF RISK TAKERS OR VISIONARIES, BUT RATHER A </p><p>MORE OR LESS GENUINELY COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP (WITHOUT </p><p>ANY HOTSHOTS OR STARS) THAT IS INCREASINGLY PRAGMATIC </p><p>RATHER THAN DOGMATIC.  THESE INDIVIDUALS APPARENTLY </p><p>UNDERSTAND AND AGREE ON THE CRITICAL NEED FOR ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND JOB CREATION, WHILE NONETHELESS </p><p>STRIVING TO MINIMIZE THREATS TO SOCIAL ORDER, DOMESTIC </p><p>STABILITY, AND MAINTENANCE OF CPV POLITICAL POWER. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  EMBASSY BELIEVES THAT THE NEW LEADERSHIP WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO BE COMPOSED OF INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM THE </p><p>USG CAN WORK PRODUCTIVELY.  WE LOOK FORWARD TO </p><p>COORDINATING WITH WASHINGTON AGENCIES ON AN ACTIVE </p><p>SCHEDULE OF VISITS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS OVER THE NEXT </p><p>YEAR AND BEYOND IN ORDER TO BUILD ON THE POSITIVE </p><p>MOMENTUM IN OUR BILATERAL TIES. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
