<p>UNCLAS STATE 317062 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PBTS, XX </p><p>SUBJECT:    STATUS OF MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND VESSELS </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 106685 (110517Z MAY 77) </p><p> </p><p>1.  REFERENCE (A) SUMMARIZED U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY AND </p><p>PRACTICE REGARDING SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY STATUS OF VESSELS </p><p>EMPLOYED BY THE U.S. NAVY\'S MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND </p><p>(MSC).  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>DEFENSE STRATEGIC SEALIFT PROGRAM NECESSITATE A </p><p>REVISION OF THE POLICIES PROMULGATED IN REFERENCE (A), </p><p>WHICH IS HEREBY CANCELLED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE VESSELS OPERATED BY THE MSC ARE THOSE OWNED BY </p><p>THE USG, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE NATIONAL DEFENSE </p><p>RESERVE FLEET; THOSE BAREBOAT CHARTERED TO THE USG; AND </p><p>THOSE TIME OR VOYAGE CHARTERED TO THE USG.  SHIPS </p><p>DESIGNATED UNITED STATES NAVAL SHIPS (USNS) ARE EITHER </p><p>OWNED BY OR BAREBOAT CHARTERED TO THE US NAVY.  MSC </p><p>BAREBOAT CHARTERED VESSELS ARE PRIVATELY OWNED AND ARE </p><p>MANNED EITHER BY U.S. GOVERNMENT CIVIL SERVICE CREWS OR </p><p>BY CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES.  THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF </p><p>BAREBOAT CHARTERED SHIPS, EITHER BY PAINTING OR BY </p><p>STACK MARKINGS, IS USUALLY THE SAME AS U.S. GOVERNMENT </p><p>OWNED USNS.  PRIVATELY OWNED AND OPERATED VESSELS </p><p>CHARTERED BY MSC FOR A PERIOD OF TIME OR FOR A </p><p>SPECIFIED VOYAGE OR VOYAGES ARE USUALLY MANNED BY </p><p>CIVILIAN PRIVATE SECTOR CREWS EMPLOYED BY A COMMERCIAL </p><p>OPERATOR, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND </p><p>USED EXCLUSIVELY TO TRANSPORT U.S. GOVERNMENT </p><p>NON-COMMERCIAL CARGO.  THEY DO NOT, HOWEVER, BEAR </p><p>DISTINCTIVE U.S. GOVERNMENT MARKINGS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW, ALL VESSELS </p><p>OWNED OR OPERATED BY A STATE AND USED ON GOVERNMENT </p><p>NON-COMMERCIAL SERVICE ARE ENTITLED TO SOVEREIGN </p><p>IMMUNITY.  THIS MEANS SUCH VESSELS ARE, INTER ALIA, </p><p>IMMUNE FROM ARREST AND SEARCH, WHETHER IN FOREIGN </p><p>INTERNAL OR TERRITORIAL WATERS OR ON THE HIGH SEAS; </p><p>IMMUNE FROM ALL FOREIGN TAXATION; EXEMPT FROM ANY </p><p>FOREIGN STATE REGULATION REQUIRING FLYING THE FLAG OF </p><p>SUCH FOREIGN STATE EITHER IN ITS PORTS OR WHILE PASSING </p><p>THROUGH ITS TERRITORIAL SEA; AND ENTITLED TO EXCLUSIVE </p><p>CONTROL OVER PERSONS ON BOARD SUCH VESSELS WITH RESPECT </p><p>TO ACTS PERFORMED ON BOARD .  THESE SHIPS, HOWEVER, ARE </p><p>EXPECTED TO COMPLY VOLUNTARILY WITH THE LAWS OF THE </p><p>HOST STATE WITH REGARD TO ORDER IN THE PORTS, CASTING </p><p>ANCHOR, SANITATION AND QUARANTINE, ETC.  ALL VESSELS IN </p><p>THE SERVICE OF MSC, WHETHER USG OWNED, BAREBOAT </p><p>CHARTERED, TIME OR VOYAGE CHARTERED, ARE IN EXCLUSIVE </p><p>GOVERNMENT NON-COMMERCIAL SERVICE.  EACH OF THESE </p><p>VESSELS IS ENTITLED TO FULL SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN THE PAST, FULL SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY HAS BEEN </p><p>CLAIMED (AND HAS GENERALLY BEEN ACCORDED) FOR USNS </p><p>VESSELS ONLY.  AS A MATTER OF POLICY THE USG DID NOT </p><p>CLAIM FULL SOVEREIGN IMMUNE STATUS FOR TIME AND VOYAGE </p><p>CHARTERED VESSELS ALTHOUGH AS A JURIDICAL MATTER OUR </p><p>POSITION HAS BEEN THAT SUCH VESSELS ARE ENTITLED TO </p><p>FULL IMMUNITY.  THIS WAS DONE PRINCIPALLY TO AVOID </p><p>NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR DIPLOMATIC CLEARANCE AND TO AVOID </p><p>CONFUSION BY FOREIGN STATES WHEN THOSE VESSELS ENTERED </p><p>THEIR PORTS.  WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, IMMUNITIES CLAIMED </p><p>FOR SUCH VESSELS HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO FREEDOM FROM </p><p>ARREST AND IMMUNITY FROM TAXATION, AND HAVE BEEN </p><p>ARRANGED ON A BILATERAL BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, MSC HAS BEEN BRINGING ON </p><p>LINE THE AFLOAT PREPOSITIONING FORCE (APF), MOST OF </p><p>WHICH IS TIME CHARTERED.  IN THE CASE OF THE APF, THE </p><p>POLICY NOTED ABOVE IS NOT SATISFACTORY.  APF VESSELS </p><p>ARE LOADED ENTIRELY WITH COMBAT EQUIPMENT, FUEL AND </p><p>COMBAT SUPPORT SUPPLIES.  THE CONTENTS OF THEIR CARGO </p><p>IS THEREFORE SENSITIVE AND CANNOT BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR </p><p>INSPECTION BY FOREIGN AUTHORITIES.  APF SHIPS ARE </p><p>EXPECTED TO CALL ONLY AT A LIMITED NUMBER OF PORTS AND </p><p>NOT TO MAKE PORT CALLS AS FREQUENTLY AS, E.G., TANKERS </p><p>OR GENERAL PURPOSE DRY CARGO CARRIERS.  IN VIEW OF THE </p><p>UNIQUE NATURE OF THE AFLOAT PREPOSITIONING FORCE, IT IS </p><p>THE POLICY OF THE USG THAT ALL AFLOAT PREPOSITIONING </p><p>FORCE VESSELS, INCLUDING TIME CHARTERED VESSELS, MUST </p><p>BE AFFORDED THE FULL SOVEREIGN PRIVILEGES AND </p><p>IMMUNITIES CURRENTLY CLAIMED FOR AND ACCORDED USNS </p><p>VESSELS.  WITH RESPECT TO MSC VOYAGE CHARTERED VESSELS </p><p>AND MSC TIME CHARTERED VESSELS NOT A PART OF THE AFLOAT </p><p>PREPOSITIONING FORCE, USG GENERAL POLICY IS TO CONTINUE </p><p>TO CLAIM IMMUNITY ONLY FROM ARREST AND TAXATION. </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ARISE WHICH NECESSITATE ASSERTIONS OF </p><p>SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY FOR TIME OR VOYAGE CHARTERED VESSELS </p><p>IN ADDITION TO THOSE IN THE APF.  WHEN SUCH CASES HAVE </p><p>ARISEN IN THE PAST, SPECIFIC GUIDANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED </p><p>AT THE TIME.  THIS PROCEDURE WILL CONTINUE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  REQUEST ALL POSTS TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO INSURE </p><p>HOST GOVERNMENTS ARE AWARE, WHEN APPROPRIATE, OF THE </p><p>STATUS OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNE VESSELS AND ASSIST IN </p><p>ASSURING RECOGNITION OF THIS STATUS.  POSTS SHOULD BE </p><p>AWARE THAT AFLOAT PREPOSITIONING FORCE TIME CHARTERED </p><p>MSC SHIPS WILL REQUIRE DIPLOMATIC CLEARANCE FOR PORT </p><p>CALLS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  THE REQUEST FOR DIPLOMATIC </p><p>CLEARANCE WILL EXPLICITLY IDENTIFY THESE VESSELS AS </p><p>AFLOAT PREPOSITIONING FORCE SHIPS OF MSC.  THEY MAY NOT </p><p>BE PAINTED DISTINCTIVELY OR BEAR THE MSC LOGO.  IT IS </p><p>ESSENTIAL FOR POSTS TO IMPRESS UPON THEIR HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENTS THE STATUS OF SUCH SHIPS IN THE EVENT OF </p><p>PORT CALLS OR OTHER OPERATIONS IN HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>TERRITORIAL SEAS AND INTERNAL WATERS.  THE LIST OF </p><p>SHIPS CURRENTLY IN THE APF IS AVAILABLE FROM THE CHIEF </p><p>OF NAVAL OPERATIONS (OP-42). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARMACOST </p><p></p></div>
