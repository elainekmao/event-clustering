<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008381 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/IFD/OMA AND E </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND GUNARATNE </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/18/2010 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PINR, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: THE NEW GOVERNMENT\'S CORE ECONOMIC TEAM </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 6259 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 1.5 (b, </p><p>d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The new Government Cabinet was announced by Prime </p><p>Minister Abdullah Gul, following his meeting with President </p><p>Sezer November 18.   Following are post\'s informal </p><p>biographical notes on several of the likely key economic </p><p>players.  When asked at the press conference "who will be the </p><p>economy minister," Gul was careful to state that the detailed </p><p>portfolios have not yet been determined.  But it appears </p><p>likely that DPM Sener will be in charge of economic affairs, </p><p>with State Minister Babacan overseeing the Treasury, and </p><p>State Minister Tuzmen overseeing Foreign Trade.  Because AK </p><p>is reducing the number of ministries (from 38 to 24), these </p><p>positions may not correspond exactly to existing ministerial </p><p>positions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Sener was the AK Party\'s Chief of Operations, and is </p><p>one of three deputy ministers.  He served as Finance Minister </p><p>in 1996-97 under the Refah Yol Government.  Born in 1954, he </p><p>has a BA from Ankara University\'s elite Political Science </p><p>faculty in 1977, a PhD in economics from Ankara\'s Gazi </p><p>University, and served on the economic faculty of Ankara\'s </p><p>Hacetepe University in the 1980\'s, rising to the post of </p><p>Assistant Dean. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Sener, in our initial meeting with him, projected </p><p>confidence in AK\'s mandate and in his ability to get things </p><p>done within the party.  He can sometimes takes a hard line, </p><p>but then shows flexibility in negotiations.  He stressed that </p><p>Turkey needed to strengthen its engagement with the outside </p><p>world, including the international financial community.  He </p><p>speaks little to no English, and comes from the Chechen </p><p>ethnic group in Turkey (his family, likes thousands of </p><p>others, immigrated to Turkey from the Caucasus in the late </p><p>19th century). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State Minister Ali Babacan </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Babacan was Coordinator of AK\'s Economic Committee, </p><p>and was in charge of the party\'s outreach to the </p><p>international financial community.  He led the party\'s early </p><p>October "road show" to Frankfurt, London and Europe, and </p><p>initiated several pre-election meetings with IMF resrep (AK </p><p>was the only political party to meet with IMF.)  Babacan told </p><p>us he wrote the economic sections of the party\'s platform </p><p>(see www.akparti.org.tr).  He acted as press spin control for </p><p>some pre and post-"mis-statements" by other AK figures.  He </p><p>is considered the most "market friendly" figure for the </p><p>markets, and is likely to get the Treasury portfolio. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Born in 1967, Babacan is the youngest member of the </p><p>Cabinet.  He has an MBA in marketing from Northwestern </p><p>University (1992), and an industrial engineering degree from </p><p>Ankara\'s Middle East Technical University (1989).  He worked </p><p>for a bank consulting firm, QRM, Inc. in Chicago, from </p><p>1992-94.  Since 1994, he has run the family wholesale textile </p><p>business in Ankara.  He has also acted as an advisor to the </p><p>Mayor of Ankara Gokcek, helping to arrange project financing. </p><p> He speaks fluent English. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In our frequent meetings with Babacan since August, </p><p>we are impressed with his general intelligence, knowledge of </p><p>financial markets and economic fundamentals.  But, as banking </p><p>and market contacts have many times reiterated, Babacan has </p><p>no experience managing an economic reform program.  His lack </p><p>of experience can be overcome by working closely with the </p><p>Turkish Treasury\'s experienced staff and the IMF.  But his </p><p>degree of freedom and ability to make policy will be an </p><p>initial question mark, given AK\'s centralized process of </p><p>decision-making. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State Minister Kursad Tuzmen </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Tuzmen was elected an AK Party MP from Gaziantep in </p><p>the November elections, but is best known to Washington </p><p>interlocutors as the former Undersecretary of Foreign Trade. </p><p>In that position, he was considered close to the prior </p><p>government\'s coalition partner MHP, though he clashed </p><p>frequently with his State Minister Tuncay Toskay.  He is a </p><p>strong, even vociferous advocate of Turkish industry, and has </p><p>in the past brought industry reps into bilateral U.S.-Turkey </p><p>meetings.  Tuzmen has a forceful personality, and often is </p><p>combative.  As Foreign Trade U/S, he demonstrated keen </p><p>interest in promoting trade with Iraq, and led several </p><p>Turkish business delegations to Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Tuzmen rose up in the Foreign Trade Undersecretariat </p><p>bureaucracy, becoming a director general of Free Zones, and </p><p>then Deputy Undersecretary. For his work on behalf of the </p><p>duty free zone businesses, he was awarded "Bureaucrat of the </p><p>Year" by a Turkish business magazine in 2001.  He had earlier </p><p>served as an expert on duty free zones in the State Planning </p><p>Organization.  Tuzmen speaks English, with a BS in management </p><p>from the Middle East Technical University and an MBA from the </p><p>Universitiy of Illinois. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Industry and Commerce Ali Coskun </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Ali Coskun, born in 1939, is AK\'s Vice Chairman of </p><p>Economic Affairs and a well known, pro-Islamist Istanbul </p><p>businessman.  In frequent meetings beginning in August, he </p><p>strikes us as an "old school" Turkish businessman who sees </p><p>the state\'s role in the economy as largely to subsidize </p><p>private industry, through the traditional channels of </p><p>below-market loans for exports and other means.  He opposed </p><p>the establishment of the independent banking board BRSA in </p><p>2000, and has continued to criticize it.  At the same time, </p><p>he deferred in our meetings to other AK figures like Babacan, </p><p>younger than him, who had differing ideas.  His ministerial </p><p>job as an advocate for industry and the "real sector" may not </p><p>grant him much control over policy, which is good.  He is not </p><p>dogmatic, and has a good sense of humor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Coskun is a former ANAP supporter, who after the </p><p>death of President Ozal joined Refah.  He was elected to </p><p>parliament first as a Refah deputy from Istanbul and then </p><p>from the Refah successor Fazilet Party.  He has served as an </p><p>executive of several semi-official business associations:  a </p><p>founding member of the Foreign Economic Relations Board </p><p>(DEIK); its U.S. branch, the Turkish American Business </p><p>Association (TABA); and the Union of Chambers of Commerce of </p><p>Islamic Countries.   He owns several ceramic tile factories </p><p>in Istanbul.  His other main business was as Chairman of an </p><p>Islamic bank - Ihlas Finans - which went bankrupt in February </p><p>2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Energy Hilmi Guler </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Guler has been head of AK\'s research and development </p><p>group.  Born in 1949, he graduated from Ankara\'s Middle East </p><p>Technical University with a degree in metallurgical </p><p>engineering.  He worked in the Turkish Aircraft Industry as a </p><p>project engineer, and later served on the boards of several </p><p>public sector entities, including TUBITAK (Turkish Scientific </p><p>and Technical Research Organization), IGDAS (the Istanbul Gas </p><p>Distribution Company) and Erdemir (the state-owned steel </p><p>giant), and Etibank (the former state bank mandated to </p><p>support the mining industry, later privatized and now </p><p>bankrupt).  In Embassy\'s  initial meetings, Guler struck us </p><p>as reasonable and pragmatic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Finance Kemal Unakitan </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Unakitan is a relative unknown with whom Embassy has </p><p>never met.  He was named at the last-minute to replace Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan as an Istanbul parliamentary candidate when Erdogan </p><p>was prohibited from running.  We have heard that he worked </p><p>with Erdogan in a financial capacity in the Istanbul </p><p>municipality.  He worked as a Finance Ministry auditor, and </p><p>then served as President of Turkey\'s Pulp and Paper </p><p>Association under Prime Minister Demirel in 1978.  He has </p><p>previously served as a board member of the Islamic bank </p><p>Al-Baraka Turk, and currently sits on the board of Family </p><p>Finans, previously known as Feisal Finans (an Islamic bank </p><p>partly owned by Saudis). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
