King Abdullah and UNESCO DG Matsuura led a </p><p>"virtual" groundbreaking ceremony at the site of the </p><p>proposed synchrotron facility.   Member state contributions </p><p>and finances continued to dominate the debate and remain a </p><p>sticking point for forward progress and </p><p>self-sustainability.  The hardest blow, though downplayed </p><p>by SESAME Chair Schopper, was a less than favorable </p><p>EU-commissioned review of SESAME and the EU\'s subsequent </p><p>decision not to provide several million dollars in </p><p>funding.  IAEA Deputy DG Burkart also made it clear that </p><p>his organization would only provide occasional training </p><p>opportunities and that SESAME\'s greatest challenge lies in </p><p>identifying means to sustain itself.  Two Israeli </p><p>representatives attended under heavy security but were not </p><p>lightening rods for "political" remarks.  On the horizon, </p><p>and something likely to stir debate within the SESAME </p><p>community, is Libya\'s recent request for observer status. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>A VIRTUAL GROUNDBREAKING </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) The 9 th meeting of the International Interim Council </p><p>of SESAME (Synchrotron Light for Experimental Science and </p><p>Applications in the Middle East), convened in Amman January </p><p>5-6, was a mixed bag of positive and discouraging </p><p>developments.  On the bright side, SESAME Chairman Herwig </p><p>Schopper had received in December a request from Egypt to </p><p>officially become a member of the organization, bringing </p><p>the total number of official member states to six and </p><p>meeting the statutory requirement for the SESAME project to </p><p>be officially launched.  The six are Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, </p><p>Jordan, Palestinian Authority, and Turkey.  We also learned </p><p>at the meeting that Israel had days earlier sent a </p><p>"conditional" letter of membership, pending clarification </p><p>of the contentious member contributions issue.  On the </p><p>margins of the meeting, the Egyptian delegates proudly </p><p>talked of how Egypt had "tipped the scales" and brought </p><p>SESAME to fruition.  By the second day of the proceedings, </p><p>and following the "groundbreaking" ceremony at which King </p><p>Abdullah decorated Schopper and UNESCO DG Koichiro </p><p>Matsuura, Schopper dropped the word "interim" from the </p><p>council and declared SESAME officially established. </p><p>Needless to say, the Jordanian government has yet to award </p><p>the contract for the construction of the facility and </p><p>digging will likely not begin for another several months. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>IN FOR A PENNY, IN FOR A POUND </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Still dogging the project, however, is its ability to </p><p>become self-sustaining.  With member states continuing to </p><p>drag their feet on contributions, SESAME has few operating </p><p>funds, let alone sufficient finances for necessary start up </p><p>activities, such as upgrading the Bessy I synchrotron to </p><p>the appropriate power and obtaining the necessary beamlines </p><p>to conduct its work.  Despite the fact that annual </p><p>contributions were set at a seemingly paltry $50,000 per </p><p>member, it has not encouraged a rush to financially support </p><p>SESAME.  In fact, UNESCO Director of Basic and Engineering </p><p>Sciences and SESAME Secretary Maciej Nalecz announced at </p><p>the meeting that only Greece and the United Arab Emirates </p><p>are in good standing, vis-a-vis contributions, calling this </p><p>development "disturbing."  The estimated 2003 budget is </p><p>only $100,000 larger than 2002, coming in at $710,000.  One </p><p>of the Israeli participants confided to us that, although </p><p>SESAME leadership optimistically believes $3-5 million is </p><p>necessary for annual operating costs, other experts in </p><p>synchrotron light science agree that the figure is closer </p><p>to $10-15 million. </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Nalecz spoke passionately of the importance of making </p><p>SESAME financially independent.  He urged member states to </p><p>make their contributions in a timely manner and to become </p><p>stakeholders in the project.  Self-sustainability is vital </p><p>to SESAME\'s identity, Nalecz added.  He also underscored </p><p>that UNESCO would play the role of catalyst, and should not </p><p>be viewed as an administrator or financier of SESAME. </p><p>UNESCO has "no budget associated with SESAME."  "We want to </p><p>make very clear UNESCO will assist with networking and help </p><p>with fellowships and training," Nalecz committed.  Schopper </p><p>chimed in with an appeal to observer states, singling out </p><p>the U.S., to continue their financial support of SESAME. </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Throughout the two-day meeting, and as in previous </p><p>years, debate surrounded the question of how to determine </p><p>member states\' financial contributions.  Some favored </p><p>basing annual contributions on a UN-type scale; others yet </p><p>expressed their desire to revisit systems based on GDP, per </p><p>capita GDP, or user community (i.e. potential number of </p><p>scientists in-country), or a combination thereof.  At the </p><p>end of the day, it became increasingly clear that whatever </p><p>system is chosen it would need to identify some upper </p><p>limit; otherwise, all member states would be reluctant to </p><p>make such an open-ended financial commitment to SESAME, </p><p>fearing a spiraling of start-up and operating costs over </p><p>the years. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>EU FUNDING NIXED </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) The most crushing recent blow to SESAME was the </p><p>announcement at the meeting that the EU, long expected to </p><p>pony up about $8 million to the project, had concluded </p><p>through a techno-economic feasibility study of SESAME, </p><p>commissioned by the EU, not to provide funding.  Anthony </p><p>Cary, Chef de Cabinet of Commissioner Patten, wrote </p><p>Schopper on October 22, "In view of the substantial </p><p>clarifications and revisions needed, and in the absence of </p><p>firm commitments of the members of SESAME, I regret to </p><p>inform you that at this stage the Commission is not in a </p><p>position to provide Community funding for SESAME."  "The </p><p>final report makes a number of recommendations for </p><p>improving of the scientific and technical analysis, for </p><p>revising estimates of the likely start-up and running costs </p><p>of SESAME, and for more rigorous scientific and </p><p>administrative management of the project," Cary added.  The </p><p>EU, which normally sends an observer delegate to SESAME, </p><p>was conspicuously absent from this meeting. </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Schopper, eager to downplay the EU decision and to </p><p>paint as promising a future picture as possible, </p><p>continuously expressed his view that the door to EU money </p><p>remained open, pending SESAME meeting the "conditions" </p><p>outlined in the evaluation.  He called the evaluation "in </p><p>principle, a very positive recommendation," adding that he </p><p>didn\'t think the review panel fully understood the </p><p>political goals of SESAME.  During remarks given at the </p><p>"groundbreaking," Schopper\'s persistent hope of securing EU </p><p>money raised no small number of eyebrows among the </p><p>assembled SESAME participants.  These individuals were </p><p>decidedly less optimistic, not publicly airing their views </p><p>but sharing their concerns with one another in discussions </p><p>on the margins. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>IAEA DAMPENS SESAME HOPES ALSO </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) IAEA Deputy DG Burkart delivered a sobering wakeup </p><p>call to SESAME participants when he, on the one hand, </p><p>offered his agency\'s moral support and congratulations on </p><p>the official establishment of SESAME, but clarified that </p><p>the IAEA was "not into basic research" and counseled the </p><p>SESAME Council to make the project self-sustaining. </p><p>Burkart offered IAEA as an institution that would continue </p><p>to help by contributing to training of SESAME staff; </p><p>however, general funding for the project was not in the </p><p>offing. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>TRAINEES MIA--A BIRD IN THE HAND . . . </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Yet another disappointment was the report of the </p><p>Training Committee, during which the assembled SESAME </p><p>participants learned that of the 21 individuals identified </p><p>for staff positions at the new facility, and who had been </p><p>sent to various synchrotron facilities worldwide for </p><p>training, only five remain.  The rest have jumped ship and </p><p>have been absorbed into existing synchrotron communities. </p><p>Addressing the retention problem, the Iranian delegate (and </p><p>Training Committee Chair) intimated that the lack of a </p><p>clear future and timeline for SESAME probably contributed </p><p>to these trainees accepting positions with other facilities </p><p>and academic institutions.  Twelve U.S.-bound trainees were </p><p>among the SESAME prospective employees who bolted. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>ISRAELIS WELCOMED </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) On a positive note, the two Israeli representatives </p><p>made it to this meeting, albeit under heavy security </p><p>provided by the Jordanian hosts.  They participated fully </p><p>and were generally openly welcomed by their Arab </p><p>counterparts at the SESAME proceedings.  When queried, one </p><p>of the Israelis shared with us that they maintain excellent </p><p>relations with most of the other representatives, but added </p><p>that the Egyptian delegation could be difficult and cold. </p><p>He further confided, "Some of our best collaboration is </p><p>with the Palestinians and Iranians." </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Talking of Schopper\'s December visit to Israel, </p><p>during which he addressed a distinguished gathering of the </p><p>country\'s leading scientists in all fields on SESAME, the </p><p>Israeli delegate said that there was significant opposition </p><p>to the project.  When Schopper attempted to defend SESAME </p><p>by claiming the scientific research associated with it was </p><p>strictly for peaceful purposes, he was challenged about the </p><p>wisdom of building Arab capacity in a field that could have </p><p>dual-uses.  Specifically, the Israeli representative told </p><p>us that several leading Israeli scientists charged that </p><p>SESAME was "educating the next generation of terrorists." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>IN-KIND CONTRIBUTIONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Stanford University\'s Herman Winick reported that his </p><p>institution is dismantling a synchrotron and equipment from </p><p>that machine on the order of $1 million will be available </p><p>for SESAME.  He is working to secure the necessary export </p><p>licenses from Departments of Energy and Commerce, but </p><p>sought assistance with shipping costs.  A possible solution </p><p>that was discussed would be to take some of the $50,000 </p><p>contribution from DOE, scheduled for April 2003, and </p><p>negotiate language to use some of these funds to ship the </p><p>component from Stanford to Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) According to Schopper, the American Physical Society </p><p>was to approach DOE to solicit a financial contribution for </p><p>the beamlines; however, this was apparently dependent upon </p><p>a positive outcome of the EU evaluation and the formal </p><p>establishment of SESAME, which was announced on January 6. </p><p>It is now unclear if DOE would be willing to help fund the </p><p>beamlines, as the EU review prompted a negative response </p><p>from Brussels to assist SESAME. </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) The French observer announced that France is closing </p><p>down a synchrotron facility in Paris in the immediate </p><p>future, and that surplus equipment--especially </p><p>beamlines--would likely be available for SESAME.  He </p><p>counseled that SESAME should immediately identify the </p><p>equipment it needs and petition the French government. </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) Brazil offered three fellowships, one each to the </p><p>Palestinian Authority, Jordan, and Israel, for scientists </p><p>to spend a year at the Brazilian light source. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>COMMENT:  NOT AS EASY AS "OPEN SESAME" </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>(SBU) The SESAME project has a long and uphill road to </p><p>conquer before it becomes a viable, self-sustaining entity, </p><p>and a regional "center of excellence."  Simply breaking </p><p>ground on the new building, and even garnering the </p><p>necessary six members to formally initiate the project, </p><p>does not a regional synchrotron facility make.  Overcoming </p><p>the financial obstacles (both start-up as well as running </p><p>costs), building and training the staff, defining the users </p><p>community, soliciting scientific proposals for SESAME, all </p><p>add up to a heavy workload.  In Schopper\'s own words, "the </p><p>preparatory tasks seem modest compared with the challenges </p><p>ahead." </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
