<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000419 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, KWMN, SMIG, PHUM, TU, TIP IN TURKEY </p><p>SUBJECT: EMBASSY REQUESTS MEETING FOR GOT CONFERENCE </p><p>PARTICIPANT TOPCUOGLU WITH G/TIP DIRECTOR MILLER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 304 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch; reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 2. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Action Request.  That G/TIP director John Miller meet </p><p>GOT trafficking-in-persons (TIP) inter-agency task force </p><p>leader Fatma Firat Topcuoglu, MFA DDG for Consular Affairs, </p><p>on the margins of Feb 2003 G/TIP-sponsored conference </p><p>"Pathbreaking Strategies in the Global Fight Against Sex </p><p>Trafficking."  Such a meeting would underscore the need for </p><p>GOT to take further steps to show its commitment to progress </p><p>in the fight against trafficking-in-persons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) GOT has made significant strides in the last year to </p><p>combat trafficking: passing anti-trafficking legislation in </p><p>August 2002, creating an inter-agency task force which meets </p><p>at least monthly, increasing its participation in relevant </p><p>international venues, and drafting a National Action Plan. </p><p>These steps are an important component to successfully </p><p>fighting TIP.  However, we need to encourage GOT to take </p><p>further steps.  A meeting with G/TIP director would help </p><p>focus GOT efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Embassy Comment </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Following the publication of DOS annual TIP report in </p><p>April 2002 in which Turkey was placed on Tier III, US-Turkey </p><p>relations were strained.  We think a meeting with G/TIP </p><p>director would help underscore the range of steps Turkey </p><p>could take to meet its responsibilities and better protect </p><p>individuals from trafficking similar to Tier II or I </p><p>countries.  We would hope to highlight the types of steps </p><p>that would add weight to the major actions detailed in para </p><p>3: e.g., establish a pilot shelter as the first in a </p><p>nationwide system and start victim-assistance training for </p><p>police and other relevant GOT officials. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
