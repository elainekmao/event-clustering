<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000959 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL:  06/04/13 </p><p>TAGS: CE, MV, AGMT, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 85  (06-04-03) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Wills, Reasons 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH JVP </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH JVP </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>1.  (C) The Ambassador met with JVP General Secretary </p><p>Tilvin Silva and senior MP Vijitha Herath in his </p><p>office earlier today (June 4).  The discussion took </p><p>place in a positive atmosphere, with the JVP members\' </p><p>expressing a desire to develop a discourse with the </p><p>USG, even if they did not always agree with USG </p><p>policies.  The Ambassador kicked off the meeting by </p><p>expressing concern with the JVP\'s stance re the peace </p><p>process and economic reform.  When queried on the </p><p>peace process, Silva (who spoke almost exclusively for </p><p>the JVP side) said his party did not see the LTTE\'s </p><p>actions during this ceasefire/peace process period as </p><p>sincere, but understood that a military solution to </p><p>the conflict was out of the question.  Silva further </p><p>said that the JVP favored negotiations and would </p><p>support devolution if favored by a majority of the Sri </p><p>Lankan people. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The JVP insisted on explaining the group\'s </p><p>economic policy views.  Silva commented that the party </p><p>supported international trade and foreign investment, </p><p>but only when Sri Lanka had a strong national economy </p><p>so as not to imperil either its own or its trading </p><p>partners\' economies(!?).  Finally, Silva commented </p><p>that the timeframe for a SLFP-JVP alliance was perhaps </p><p>one to two months down the road.  (Note:  Colombo 859 </p><p>indicated that the probable SLFP-JVP alliance was much </p><p>more imminent than that.)  Silva said the JVP\'s </p><p>desire, if the group gained power, was to deal with </p><p>the major issues of the day, rather than revamp the </p><p>government system.  With the JVP taking a relatively </p><p>moderate tack in the meeting, the Ambassador praised </p><p>the JVP on two fronts:  mastery of parliamentary </p><p>procedure and respect for democratic institutions; and </p><p>outstanding record of transparency and lack of </p><p>corruption.  Silva and Herath responded warmly to </p><p>these comments.  (Note:  Both Silva and Herath </p><p>understood English, but responded in Sinhala through a </p><p>translator.)  (POL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
