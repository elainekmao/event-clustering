<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001627 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/CCA, PRM/A, DRL/CRA, H. </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2013 </p><p>TAGS: CU, NL, PHUM, PREF, PREL, PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH TO DEPORT CUBAN ASYLUM APPLICANT ON JUNE 30 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) E-MAILS: </p><p>        WITMER/HENSHAW/SHEARER/MARJENHOFF/HAWLEY </p><p>     B. (B) SHEARER/HENSHAW E-MAIL 6/20/03 </p><p>     C. (C) SHEARER/SHEEHAN E-MAIL 6/23/03 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Counselor Mary E. Daly for reasons 1.5(b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 6. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Embassy received a letter from United States Senator </p><p>Bob Graham on June 18 requesting action on behalf of a </p><p>constituent regarding a Cuban citizen who had applied for </p><p>asylum and was being held in detention in The Netherlands. </p><p>Dutch government officials informed PolOff that the asylum </p><p>applicant, JOSE MANUEL VARGAS MARTIN, was denied asylum and </p><p>will be deported to Cuba on June 30.  GoNL officials informed </p><p>PolOff that, at any time before his deportation on June 30, </p><p>Martin would be allowed to travel to any third country that </p><p>either issued him a valid visa or provided official </p><p>verification that Martin would be allowed entry to a third </p><p>country if transported to a border crossing. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Martin applied for a visa at the Embassy of Costa </p><p>Rica, where he apparently has family ties. The Costa Rican </p><p>Embassy forwarded his application to San Jose on June 20. </p><p>PolOff spoke with the Costa Rican ConOff (protect source), </p><p>who indicated that San Jose will likely not/not issue a visa </p><p>since Martin arrived in The Netherlands without a passport or </p><p>other valid photo identification.  Martin has not/not applied </p><p>for a U.S. visa. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  UNHCR informed PolOff that UNHRC will not entertain </p><p>VARGAS MARTIN\'s refugee application based on the fact that </p><p>the GONL determined he did not have a legitimate asylum </p><p>claim.  UNHCR also told PolOff that the applicant is </p><p>represented by legal counsel and lost an appeal of the asylum </p><p>decision. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The letter forwarded to post by Senator\'s Graham\'s </p><p>office (on behalf of his stepmother Ada Maria Pastran Vargas) </p><p>indicates that VARGAS MARTIN will be persecuted upon return </p><p>to Cuba, partially because of his former relationship with </p><p>current Miami NBC reporter Joaquin Torres Alvarez.  Post has </p><p>no additional information regarding a credible fear of </p><p>persecution. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Action Request </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Embassy The Hague requests Department guidance on this </p><p>case.  Does the Department have any additional information to </p><p>provide to the GoNL that could influence his case?    Please </p><p>advise what, if any, alternative recourse may be available in </p><p>the United States and whether Department wishes to respond </p><p>directly to Senator Graham or have post do so. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
