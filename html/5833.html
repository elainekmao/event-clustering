<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000284 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR A/S ROCCA; ALSO FOR SA/INS AND D </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, PINR, PARM, CE, UK, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: HMG ON LTTE\'S PROSCRIPTION UNDER UK LAW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR E. ASHLEY WILLS.  REASONS 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) I met for an hour today (2/19) with HMG\'s very able </p><p>High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Stephen Evans.  Evans came to </p><p>see me under instructions from London to discuss next steps </p><p>in (1) moving the LTTE toward a formal renunciation of </p><p>violence and (2) attaching conditionality to loans and grants </p><p>announced at the coming Tokyo Conference so as to encourage </p><p>good behavior by the Tigers.  By classified email, I am </p><p>forwarding to SA and SA/INS a copy of the FCO cable of </p><p>instructions to Evans, which he gave to me. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) This cable should be handled very discreetly both </p><p>because he wasn\'t authorized to pass a copy to the USG and </p><p>also because in it FCO makes a surprising admission, namely </p><p>that were the LTTE to challenge its proscription under the </p><p>UK\'s 2000 Terrorism law, HMG reckons that the Tigers would </p><p>win and would be de-proscribed.  I asked Evans whether the </p><p>FCO thinks the LTTE will in fact challenge its proscription </p><p>and he said he did not know. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) We compared notes about what the LTTE needs to do to </p><p>get itself de-proscribed in our countries.  It appears that </p><p>we and the Brits agree that the Tigers need to make a public </p><p>statement permanently renouncing terrorism at least and </p><p>preferably violence of any type and then follow that </p><p>statement with a "decent period" -- presumably a period of at </p><p>least a year or two -- when its deeds match its verbal </p><p>commitments.  It appears that HMG is a bit uncertain, as are </p><p>we, about the methodology to be used in pushing a move to </p><p>de-proscribe through its bureaucracy.  As you will see from </p><p>the cable from the FCO, the UK has the further complication </p><p>of not getting crosswise with Article 14 of the European </p><p>Convention on Human Rights. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) On conditioning aid, we also agreed that it was much </p><p>to be sought in whatever assistance that we and other donors </p><p>announce in Tokyo.  We even thought it prudent to encourage </p><p>the Norwegians to talk to the Tigers ASAP about the kinds of </p><p>steps they could take prior to Tokyo to encourage donor </p><p>generosity and also to calm southern Sinhalese anxieties </p><p>about LTTE intentions.  These confidence-building steps by </p><p>the LTTE could include setting milestones for its </p><p>administration of the North and East regarding transparency </p><p>and respect for human rights; permitting local elections and </p><p>allowing non-LTTE parties to participate therein; improving </p><p>accountability regarding the taxes and other fees the LTTE </p><p>collects/extorts so that the Tamils (and we too) know how </p><p>their money is being spent; and introducing such </p><p>security-related measures as phased disarmament, putting </p><p>their long-range weapons under international supervision, etc. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Comment:  Evans and I run into one another often and </p><p>consult closely on peace-related matters.  It would be useful </p><p>for us and HMG to agree on next steps for the international </p><p>community because this will make it easier to get our EU and </p><p>Japanese pals to adopt consistent positions as we </p><p>collectively apply pressure to the two parties to the Sri </p><p>Lankan conflict. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
