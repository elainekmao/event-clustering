End summary. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS MURDER THIRD-GRADE STUDENT; </p><p>BOMB KILLS NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY </p><p>2. (U) In two separate incidents early this week, Maoist </p><p>insurgents brutally murdered a third-grade student, and </p><p>killed a nine-year-old boy with explosives intended for his </p><p>school. A few days after abducting 14-year-old Raju Tharu </p><p>on charges of \'spying,\' Maoists marched him to a bridge </p><p>near his village, where they blindfolded him, slit his </p><p>throat and hacked him to death in public, according to </p><p>witnesses in Bhimapur Village Development Committee (VDC), </p><p>in southern Bardiya district.  In western Dang district, </p><p>nine-year old Anil Kumar Choudhary was killed by a Maoist </p><p>bomb planted near his school.  He was playing with the </p><p>plastic packet of explosives when it exploded in his hands. </p><p> </p><p>ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS CONTINUE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Ongoing attacks against civilians this week claimed </p><p>the lives of three Communist Party (CPN-UML) workers, as </p><p>well as two teachers, a shopkeeper, a laborer and a member </p><p>of the Nepali Congress party.  Chakra Pasad Choudary, a </p><p>former CPN-UML parliamentarian, was shot to death by a </p><p>group of four Maoists as he returned home from a party </p><p>meeting in southwestern Kailali district.  Choudhary had </p><p>been threatened by the Maoists in September, and had </p><p>refused to pay their demand of 30,000 rupees (380 USD). The </p><p>body of party activist Kumari Deb Das was found in Nuwakot, </p><p>north of Kathmandu, several days after his abduction by </p><p>Maoists. In eastern Panchthar district, Maoists slashed 30- </p><p>year-old CPN-UML worker Hari Kambang\'s spine with a khukuri </p><p>and then shot him in the head as he was walking home from a </p><p>nearby village. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Also in Panchthar, Maoists killed Chandra Kharel, </p><p>the headmaster of a local primary school. His sister </p><p>Sarita, abducted with him from their home on November 12, </p><p>is still missing.   Another teacher, Keshar Bahadur Thapa, </p><p>was beheaded on the same day in eastern Ilam district. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In other incidents, three Maoists killed Netra </p><p>Bahadur Timilshina, a 42-year-old laborer, in a temple near </p><p>his home in central Makwanpur district. Ten armed Maoists </p><p>stormed into the home of Ramesh Thapa, in Mahendranagar, </p><p>western Kanchapur district, took him several kilometers </p><p>from his house and shot him on the highway. A group of </p><p>insurgents beat to death Baburam Poudel, a shopkeeper, </p><p>according to newspaper reports. </p><p> </p><p>KATHMANDU VALLEY: POLICE CONSTABLE SHOT DEAD, </p><p>VDC OFFICE </p><p> TORCHED, NEA ATTACKED, PRIVATE HOUSE BOMBED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>6. (U) Raja Ram Malla, a 28-year-old plain-clothes police </p><p>constable posted to a police office in south Kathmandu, was </p><p>shot by Maoist insurgents four times in the back and </p><p>abdomen as he watched television in a shop near his home on </p><p>November 19.  He died after being taken to a nearby </p><p>hospital. (Note: Malla worked in the area around Rabi </p><p>Bhawan, the location of USAID and US-affiliated Lincoln </p><p>School, where Embassy guard Ramesh Manadhar was killed in </p><p>December 2001.  Post and police have no evidence that the </p><p>shooting was related to Manadhar\'s death or the USG. End </p><p>note.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) On the night of November 18, Maoists severely </p><p>damaged the VDC building in Dachi, a village in the </p><p>Kathmandu Valley.  According to police reports, a small </p><p>group of Maoists broke into the building overnight, threw </p><p>the furniture into the street and set it ablaze, before </p><p>setting fire to the building itself. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Police also reported a bomb explosion in the home of </p><p>businessman Laba Shrestha in the northern suburb of </p><p>Bansbari.  As in several prior attacks in the Kathmandu </p><p>Valley, the bomb blast was detonated in a toilet.  No one </p><p>was injured.  Police suspect that the house was targeted </p><p>because of proximity to the home of a palace relative. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) On the morning of November 17, Maoists attacked a </p><p>Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) Sub-station in Min </p><p>Bhawan, an eastern suburb of the capital.  According to </p><p>eyewitnesses, a group of insurgents held the NEA security </p><p>guard at gunpoint while they set fire to thirteen vehicles </p><p>and blew up one of the station\'s seven transmitters. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS TERRORIZE HIGHWAYS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The rising toll of Maoist landmine victims assumed </p><p>an international dimension on Wednesday, when Jayenta Shah, </p><p>Indian sales manager of Eveready Battery Company, was </p><p>killed as his jeep hit a mine on November 20.  The </p><p>vehicle\'s three other passengers were injured in the </p><p>incident, which took place near the Indian subsidiary\'s </p><p>facility in southwestern Kailali district.  Police suspect </p><p>that the mine was intended for security forces. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) In southern Dang district, Maoists barricaded and </p><p>mined the Mahendra Highway in broad daylight on November </p><p>17, bringing traffic to a five-hour standstill. Nepal\'s </p><p>major east-west highway, the road was blocked from 10:30 am </p><p>to 3:30 pm, and was reopened only after police were able to </p><p>remove the obstacles placed by the Maoists and defuse their </p><p>MORE VDC OFFICES DESTROYED </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Continuing the recent pattern of attacks on Village </p><p>Development Committee (VDC) offices (reftel), Maoists </p><p>torched three VDC buildings in southern Sarlahi District on </p><p>Monday night. The attackers destroyed all of the furniture </p><p>and documents at offices in Kisanpur, Bela and Maohanpur </p><p>between 11pm and 2am.  Of the 99 VDCs in Sarlahi, 29 have </p><p>been destroyed by the Maoists.  An additional 32 VDCs were </p><p>destroyed in southern Arghankhanchi district from November </p><p>13-15, doing damage valued at an estimated 10 million </p><p>rupees (130,000 USD) in that district alone. </p><p> </p><p>COALITION CALLS ON UNITED NATIONS </p><p>TO CONDEMN USE OF CHILD SOLDIERS IN NEPAL </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Local press has reported that the Coalition to Stop </p><p>the Use of Child Soldiers (CSUCS), a London-based coalition </p><p>of human rights NGOs, is lobbying the United Nations to </p><p>name the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) in its response </p><p>to Security Council Resolution 1379.  The resolution </p><p>requested the Secretary-General to submit a list of state </p><p>and non-state actors using child soldiers. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) According to the 195-page, 25-country "1379 Report" </p><p>released by CSUS earlier this month, as many as 30 percent </p><p>of Nepal\'s Maoist fighters could be under 18 years of age. </p><p>The coalition based its findings on news reports and </p><p>documents compiled from NGOs, including Amnesty </p><p>Internat </p><p>ional and Human Rights Watch. </p><p> </p><p>FURTHER INFORMATION ON TIGER MOUNTAIN BOMB </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) A manager of Tiger Mountain travel agency has </p><p>told DCM that the recent small bomb explosion in the agency </p><p>office\'s toilet (reftel) was almost certainly retaliation </p><p>against the Kathmandu office\'s resistance to Maoist </p><p>extortion, and not a sign of any new threat against </p><p>tourists.  According to the manager, Tiger Mountain\'s local </p><p>office assisted Kathmandu police in setting up a successful </p><p>sting operation to capture a Maoist who had been demanding </p><p>money from the agency.  Tiger Mountain has been approaching </p><p>other hotels and travel agencies in an attempt to persuade </p><p>them to do the same, but has met with no cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
