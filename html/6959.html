<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 001168 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>LONDON FOR ETHAN GOLDRICH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: OVIP, US, IZ, KU, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MINISTER OF STATE PLANS P-5 TOUR, REQUESTS </p><p>WHITE HOUSE CALL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Kuwait\'s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh </p><p>Dr. Mohammed al-Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah contacted the </p><p>Ambassador on March 30 to inform him that he is planning a </p><p>whirlwind tour of P-5 capitals, most likely beginning with </p><p>meetings on April 7 in Beijing and proceeding westward to </p><p>Moscow, Paris, London and Washington, where he hoped to hold </p><p>meetings the week of April 14.  According to Dr. Mohammed, </p><p>his primary purpose in the first three stops would be to </p><p>complain about Iraqi missile attacks on Kuwait (using </p><p>equipment and technology largely provided by his hosts in </p><p>those capitals).  In London and Washington, he would seek to </p><p>convey a public message that Kuwait stands by its allies as </p><p>they prosecute "a legitimate war for a just cause, the </p><p>liberation of the Iraqi people." </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Dr. Mohammed added that he thought his trip would send </p><p>different messages to different audiences.  He hoped that it </p><p>would reassure Kuwaitis that their government is actively </p><p>working to protect them by confidently standing up for its </p><p>rights and renewing its alliances.  He thought that the trip </p><p>would demonstrate to the Arab world that Kuwait has powerful </p><p>friends; it is not alone or isolated.  Finally, he wanted the </p><p>tour to show the citizens of the UK and the US that their </p><p>countries are in turn not isolated from the Arab world; Arabs </p><p>who know Saddam\'s barbarity first-hand are with them in their </p><p>efforts to liberate the long-suffering Iraqi people. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Responding to the Ambassador\'s questions, Dr. Mohammed </p><p>said that he had not yet discussed the trip with other P-5 </p><p>ambassadors but would do so immediately.  He added that he </p><p>hoped for a full program of meetings in Washington, including </p><p>at State, DOD and most importantly, the White House.  He </p><p>argued that a meeting with the President personally would </p><p>send an important symbolic message to the people of the </p><p>United States, Kuwait and the world that Kuwait was a full </p><p>and willing partner in the coalition to free the Iraqi people </p><p>from Saddam\'s "occupation".  The Ambassador agreed to relay </p><p>this request to Washington. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT/RECOMMENDATION: A former Ambassador to the </p><p>U.S., Dr. Mohammed is Kuwait\'s de facto Foreign Minister. </p><p>The scion of a long line of Kuwaiti Amirs and with a Harvard </p><p>PhD, he is also a serious contender to become ruler himself </p><p>one day.  He was a consistent ally in our early efforts to </p><p>win active Kuwaiti support for disarming Iraq and helped </p><p>steer Kuwait toward a more assertive public posture against </p><p>Saddam.  At the recent OIC summit in Doha he personally stood </p><p>up to Iraqi name-calling.  He also helped Kuwait to overcome </p><p>its traditional reticence and agree to be declared a member </p><p>of the coalition.  Kuwait is the only Arab state to take this </p><p>step so far.  We therefore strongly recommend that Washington </p><p>arrange a full program of top-level meetings for Dr. </p><p>Mohammed, including with President Bush.  A call on the </p><p>President, no matter how brief, would send a clear message </p><p>that America understands and appreciates Kuwait\'s unique </p><p>contribution to the coalition.  It would also help to cement </p><p>further our relationship with this dynamic member of the </p><p>rising generation of the al-Sabah. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
