ACCORDING TO </p><p>WALI, THE GERMANS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE VEHICLE AVAILABLE </p><p>FOR THE KING UPON HIS ARRIVAL IN KABUL.  THE VEHICLE WEIGHS </p><p>4,150 KG. AND HAS "ALL SECURITY MEASURES INCORPORATED."  (THE </p><p>AFGHANS ALSO USED THE TERM "BULLET-PROOF."  WE ASSUME THIS IS </p><p>AN ARMORED VEHICLE.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  WALI RECEIVED THE INFORMATION FROM DR. RAHMAN </p><p>ASHRAF, WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS AN AFGHAN-GERMAN GEOLOGY </p><p>PROFESSOR WHO REGULARLY SPEAKS TO THE AFGHANS ON BEHALF OF </p><p>THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT.  WALI THEN HAD DR.

ASHRAF ASSERTED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01416  201215Z </p><p>EVERY DAY, TWO AIRCRAFT FLY FROM RAMSTEIN AFB TO BAGRAM; THE </p><p>GERMANS HOPED TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE VEHICLE ON ONE OF THESE </p><p>FLIGHTS -- ONE ARRIVING BEFORE THE KING DOES.

THE KING DEPARTS ROME MARCH </p><p>25, TO ARRIVE IN AFGHANISTAN MARCH 26, SO THERE IS LITTLE </p><p>TIME TO GET THE MERCEDES IN PLACE TO RECEIVE HIM ON THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01416  201215Z </p><p>GROUND, AS THE GERMANS REPORTEDLY WANT AND WE MAY WISH TO </p><p>SUPPORT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01416 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
