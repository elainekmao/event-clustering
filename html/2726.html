<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000701 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBUSH KILLS FIVE SOLDIERS; ABORTED GENERAL </p><p>STRIKE DISRUPTS LIFE OUTSIDE KATHMANDU </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) KATHMANDU 632 AND PREVIOUS, B) KATHMANDU 529; C) </p><p> </p><p>KATHMANDU 498, D) KATHMANDU 496 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Maoists attacked an army convoy in a </p><p>remote western district April 6, killing five, including </p><p>the Major in command of the local detachment.  Army </p><p>personnel immediately launched a counter-attack that </p><p>reportedly killed thirteen insurgents.  The attack </p><p>occurred less than a mile from the Indian border.  The </p><p>Maoists failed in a similar attack the same day on army </p><p>vehicles traveling east of the capital.  Although Maoist </p><p>leader Prachanda postponed a general strike originally </p><p>called for April 2-5, many Nepalese elected to lie low </p><p>during that period, especially in heavily Maoist-affected </p><p>districts of western Nepal.  Across the country, long- </p><p>distance transport entirely shut down.  So far, final </p><p>exams for graduating Nepalese students have been held </p><p>without serious incident.  The army seems to have </p><p>responded quickly and effectively to recent events, and </p><p>looks to be taking positive steps to improve their image </p><p>in the provinces.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Ambush Kills Five Soldiers, Including Major </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Maoist insurgents ambushed a Royal Nepalese Army </p><p>(RNA) patrol in western Nepal\'s Bardiya district April 6, </p><p>killing five.  The Maoists electronically set off an </p><p>explosive device in the road just as the army convoy </p><p>passed.  The casualties included Major Rakesh Shrestha, </p><p>who had arrived in the district only four days before to </p><p>take charge of security at Royal Bardiya National Park. </p><p>Shrestha\'s predecessor at the post, Major Lava Rayamajhi, </p><p>was critically injured in the attack and was not expected </p><p>to survive.  A "large number" of security personnel were </p><p>mobilized in Bardiya to hunt down the perpetrators, </p><p>according to press reports.  Thirteen insurgents were </p><p>reportedly killed in the counter-attack.  [Note: </p><p>Ambassador and Poloff had met and been briefed by Major </p><p>Rayamajhi on separate trips to Bardiya in February and </p><p>early March (Refs C and D).  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>Attack Not One Mile from India </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The attack occurred less than one mile from the </p><p>Indian border in a remote area known as Kothiyaghat, south </p><p>of the national park.  Contacts who live next to the park </p><p>told Poloff that conditions in the region had deteriorated </p><p>to the point that over the past week they have stayed in </p><p>camp, a radio their only contact with the outside world. </p><p>They added that a new Major had arrived to take charge of </p><p>the park\'s army detachment. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) According to Defense Ministry reports, in another </p><p>incident April 6 a similar landmine attack on two army </p><p>vehicles plying the Melamchi highway, east of Kathmandu, </p><p>did not succeed.  Army bomb-disposal squads defused bombs </p><p>in three districts, including one at a high school in </p><p>Dhanusa district where final exams were being held (see </p><p>para 7).  Also, food and clothing confiscated from the </p><p>Maoists in Rolpa district were distributed to needy </p><p>villagers in the area. </p><p> </p><p>Strike Called Off, But Intimidation Holds </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Although the Maoists issued a press statement </p><p>April 1 calling off their planned April 2-6 general strike </p><p>(Ref A), traffic on Kathmandu\'s streets was light during </p><p>the first week of April as long-distance transport came to </p><p>a halt and many motorists elected to keep their cars at </p><p>home.  Although government offices stayed open for the </p><p>duration, some businesses remained shuttered April 2 and </p><p>3, though by Friday, April 5, life in the capital had </p><p>mostly returned to normal. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Similar conditions prevailed in eastern Nepal and </p><p>in Pokhara, a popular tourist destination, according to </p><p>Home Ministry officials in those areas.  Although long- </p><p>distance busses did not run, local transport operated and </p><p>shops remained open.  Conditions in western Nepal were </p><p>worse, however, as traffic reportedly came to a standstill </p><p>in Saptari and Bardiya districts.  During the aborted </p><p>"bandh," or general strike, the Maoists seemed to have </p><p>been considered a threat to vehicular traffic only; across </p><p>the country shops opened and pedestrian traffic was </p><p>normal. </p><p> </p><p>Examinations Unaffected </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Aside from the incident mentioned above (para 4), </p><p>examinations for the government School Leaving Certificate </p><p>(SLC), scheduled April 2-10, have so far been held without </p><p>any serious problems, according to the Chief Examination </p><p>Controller. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. The two April 6 highway attacks on army convoys - one </p><p>in the far west, one in the east - established a pattern </p><p>dating back to a February, 2001 attack on a VIP motorcade. </p><p>Such attacks have increased in frequency since late </p><p>January of this year.  With few opportunities to hit the </p><p>army\'s assets - mostly protected in well-defended </p><p>garrisons - the Maoists have taken the battle to the </p><p>highways.  Especially in western Nepal, many of Nepal\'s </p><p>roads pass through remote, uninhabited areas where the </p><p>insurgents can lurk undetected.  The RNA\'s response to the </p><p>Kothiyaghat attack was rapid and seemingly effective. </p><p>That the army has also begun building civilian-military </p><p>relations - in this case by redistributing the Maoists\' </p><p>stores - also bodes well.  It remains to be seen whether </p><p>the attacks during the aborted bandh resulted from a lack </p><p>of communication between the Maoist leadership and cadres, </p><p>reflected a schismatic disobedience of the bandh\'s </p><p>postponement, or simply indicated that the Maoists\' terror </p><p>campaign continues. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
