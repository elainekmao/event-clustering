DECONTROL UPON RECEIPT. </p><p>- </p><p>2. FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS POSED IN </p><p>PARA 5 REFTEL: </p><p>- </p><p> </p><p>SRI LANKA </p><p>- </p><p>A) IN 1990 THE GSL PROSECUTED TWO SIGNIFICANT CASES </p><p>INVOLVING ACTS OF TERRORISM -- ONE INVOLVING THREE </p><p>INDIVIDUALS ACCUSED IN THE MAY 1986 BOMBING OF AN AIR </p><p>LANKA TRISTAR AIRCRAFT, WHICH KILLED 28, AND ANOTHER </p><p>INVOLVING FIVE ACCUSED IN THE AUGUST 1987 GRENADE ATTACK </p><p>AT PARLIAMENT, IN WHICH TWO OFFICIALS WERE KILLED AND </p><p>SEVERAL OTHERS INJURED.  IN BOTH CASES ALL OF THE </p><p>ACCUSED WERE ACQUITTED IN 1990;  HOWEVER, IN THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT BOMBING CASE, AS OF NOVEMBER 1990 THE FIVE </p><p>ACCUSED REMAINED IN CUSTODY, UNDER EMERGENCY </p><p>REGULATIONS, PENDING GOVERNMENT APPEAL OF THEIR </p><p>ACQUITTAL. </p><p>- </p><p>B) THE ISSUE OF EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS HAS </p><p>NOT ARISEN. </p><p>- </p><p>C) A POTENTIAL OBSTACLE TO FUTURE EXTRADITION OF </p><p>SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IS THE LACK OF A FORMAL EXTRADITION </p><p>TREATY BETWEEN SRI LANKA AND MOST NON-COMMONWEALTH </p><p>COUNTRIES. </p><p>- </p><p>D/E) THE GSL, WHICH HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF NUMEROUS ACTS </p><p>OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM BY POLITICAL EXTREMISTS IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS, IS ON PUBLIC RECORD AS CONDEMNING ALL FORMS OF </p><p>TERRORISM.  DURING 1990 IT FOUGHT TERRORIST INSURGENCIES </p><p>AGAINST TAMIL SEPARATISTS IN THE NORTH AND EAST AND </p><p>SINHALESE EXTREMISTS (THE JANATHA VIMUKTHI PERAMUNA OR </p><p>JVP) IN THE SOUTH.  THE LATTER INSURGENCY WAS LARGELY </p><p>DEFEATED BY EARLY 1990;  HOWEVER, AS MANY AS 15,000 </p><p>SUSPECTED MEMBERS OF THE TERRORIST JVP REMAIN IN </p><p>CUSTODY.  THE GSL HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL SEEK TO </p><p>PROSECUTE THOSE BELIEVED RESPONSIBLE FOR TERRORIST ACTS </p><p>AND WILL PROVIDE VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION TO THE </p><p>OTHERS.  THOUSANDS FOUND TO HAVE ONLY MARGINAL TIES TO </p><p>THE JVP HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED.  IN THE NORTH AND </p><p>EAST, THE LTTE SUDDENLY BROKE OFF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN JUNE AND LAUNCHED WIDESPREAD ATTACKS ON </p><p>POLICE AND MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.  SUBSEQUENTLY THE </p><p>LTTE ALSO ATTACKED NUMEROUS SINHALESE AND MUSLIM </p><p>VILLAGES, IN AN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM OUT.  THE </p><p>INSURGENCY CONTINUED FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. </p><p>- </p><p>F) NONE NOTED. </p><p>- </p><p>G) NONE NOTED. </p><p>- </p><p>H) THE GSL APPEARS AS DETERMINED AS EVER TO COMBAT BOTH </p><p>DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p>- </p><p>3. REPUBLIC OF THE MALDIVES </p><p>- </p><p>A) NONE. </p><p>- </p><p>B) NO. </p><p>- </p><p>C) NONE NOTED. </p><p>- </p><p>D) NONE NOTED. </p><p>- </p><p>E) NONE NOTED. </p><p>- </p><p>F) NONE NOTED. </p><p>- </p><p>G) NO. </p><p>- </p><p>H) NONE NOTED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CREEKMORE </p><p></p></div>
