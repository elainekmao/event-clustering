<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002787 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/02 </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, MOPS, PGOV, PREL, PREF, EPET, NI, CM </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA MIGHT IGNORE UNFAVORABLE RULING ON </p><p>BAKASSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: USDAO ABUJA 2023 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; reasons 1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Nigerian Minister of State for Defense </p><p>(Army) Batagarawa told us on September 27 said that </p><p>Nigeria would disregard an unfavorable ICJ ruling on </p><p>Bakassi.  International pressure could be withstood. </p><p>That evening, DCM heard a second report of Minister of </p><p>Defense Danjuma\'s warning to the French to stay </p><p>neutral should hostilities break out.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DCM and POLMILOFF met September 27 with </p><p>Minister of State for Defense (Army) Malam Lawal </p><p>Batagarawa to discuss the ROE for Nigerian forces </p><p>deployed to Abidjan (septel).  Batagarawa commented </p><p>that Nigeria did not want "ECOMOG 3" because of </p><p>concerns "about the situation on our eastern border" </p><p>and potential requirements to maintain domestic order </p><p>during the imminent election season. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Batagarawa mused that Cameroon had much to lose </p><p>by not working towards a negotiated settlement.  If </p><p>the ICJ ruled against Nigeria, the GON would disregard </p><p>the ruling, he declared.  Batagarawa thought the loss </p><p>of goodwill in the international community would be </p><p>short-lived and that within five years everyone would </p><p>have moved beyond Nigeria\'s continuing presence in </p><p>Bakassi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As an alternative to possible confrontation </p><p>with Cameroon, Batagarawa suggested that the two </p><p>countries could reach an arrangement similar to the </p><p>one Nigeria has with Sao Tome and Principe.  The </p><p>Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) would </p><p>develop Bakassi\'s hydrocarbon resources (onshore and </p><p>offshore) while sharing the revenue with Cameroon. </p><p>This, he argued, would allow Cameroon to benefit from </p><p>the petroleum reserves in the Bakassi while allowing </p><p>Nigeria to safeguard the interests of its </p><p>predominantly Nigerian population. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: It was not clear if Batagarawa </p><p>understood that most of Cameroon\'s existing oil </p><p>production comes from waters off Bakassi or had given </p><p>thought to how that might be factored into his joint </p><p>exploitation concept.  We chose not to explore this </p><p>with him.  Batagarawa thought the USG was being </p><p>helpful to Nigeria with respect to the Bakassi dispute </p><p>while the GOF was being duplicitous.  He peremptorily </p><p>dismissed France\'s provision of the venue for the </p><p>September 5 meeting with a wave of his hand and, "We </p><p>could have paid for a room ourselves."  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) At the September 27 Chinese National Day </p><p>reception, German Ambassador Dietmar Kreusel told DCM </p><p>the same story reported reftel: That Minister of </p><p>Defense T.Y. Danjuma had informed French Ambassador </p><p>Jean-Marc Simon that Nigeria would view "France also </p><p>as its enemy" if France were to intervene in support </p><p>of Cameroon should hostilities break out between </p><p>Nigeria and Cameroon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT: The German Ambassador seemed taken </p><p>somewhat aback by Danjuma\'s statement; he should not </p><p>have been. The Franco-Nigerian relationship in West </p><p>Africa has always been edged with tension arising from </p><p>overlapping, sometimes competing, senses of hegemony. </p><p>Further reporting on Danjuma\'s discussions with the </p><p>French follows septel.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) At a September 25 reception Embassy held for </p><p>members of the National Assembly and State liaison </p><p>officers, several Senators and Representatives </p><p>discussed Bakassi with Emboffs.  Views of how Nigeria </p><p>would respond ranged from positions similar to </p><p>Batagarawa\'s to the superficially more cooperative, </p><p>"We will faithfully implement the ICJ decision, but we </p><p>know it will favor us." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT: Whether it is Batagarawa\'s cynical </p><p>viewpoint or the Assembly Members\' insistence that </p><p>Nigeria will win at the Hague, Nigerian leaders still </p><p>have not come to grips with the distinct and imminent </p><p>probability that the ICJ will rule against them. END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
