<p>S E C R E T SANAA 001088 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, CASC, PTER, YM, EAC, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: SANAA EAC MEETING MAY 13 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) SECSTATE 12430 B) SANAA 963 C) SANAA 1071 D) </p><p> </p><p>     SANAA 1072 E) SANAA 1080 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador E.J. Hull. Reasons: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> 1. (S/NF)  The Ambassador convened an Emergency Action </p><p>Committee (EAC) meeting on May 13  to assess the threat of a </p><p>"copy cat" attack similar to Riyadh, to determine the best </p><p>approach to ROYG officials regarding the events in Riyadh and </p><p>to evaluate Embassy security preparedness.  Key offices and </p><p>personnel represented at the meeting included: AMB, DCM, </p><p>ADMIN, CONS, DAO, FPD, OMC, ORCA, PD, POL/ECON, RSO and SOC </p><p>YEMEN. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) DCM briefed on the events in Riyadh, reviewing the </p><p>methodology of the attack in Riyadh and the need for Embassy </p><p>community to be aware of potential "copycat attacks." As of </p><p>this morning, the attacks on the compounds were believed to </p><p>be conducted by two cars, a lead car that was used to take </p><p>out the guards, and a second car containing explosives. DCM </p><p>stressed that this latest modus oparandi should be understood </p><p>and incorporated into our security posture. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) After receiving notification of the Riyadh attacks </p><p>just before 3 am local time, RSO notified Embassy Security, </p><p>the Sheraton Hotel, Tourist City and Haddah compound security </p><p>contacts and asked them all to increase security.  RSO </p><p>briefed that some believe that the Riyadh operation may have </p><p>been in connection with a possible hostage-taking attempt and </p><p>noted one uncorroborated report (Ref B) of a potential for </p><p>hostage taking in Sanaa. Per Reftels C, D, E, the RSO also </p><p>stated that he is investigating a possible case of </p><p>surveillance by individuals in a Saudi-plated car currently </p><p>under investigation.  In another case, an NGO representative </p><p>called the RSO to report a rumor that the ROYG had </p><p>intercepted a pick up truck with UAE plates containing </p><p>explosives. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF) ORCA reported no new threat information concerning </p><p>Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) The EAC discussed how to share information about </p><p>this attack with ROYG officials.  The RSO will brief his MOI </p><p>and PSO contacts with details of the attack methodology (when </p><p>known) and raise the rumor about the UAE truck. SOC Yemen </p><p>will discuss the same issues with CSO. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) DCM reviewed the Embassy security posture and the </p><p>EAC agreed that an Admin notice should be sent to encourage </p><p>the Embassy community to maintain vigilant security </p><p>procedures.  Ambassador asked Consul to schedule a Warden </p><p>meeting for this week.  DCM raised the question of whether </p><p>the Embassy community should return to "Move Safe Lite," in </p><p>which Embassy officials are encouraged among other measures, </p><p>to use armored shuttles and limit non-essential movement. </p><p>EAC agreed that absent specific threats, Admin should make </p><p>the shuttles available for those who wish, but it was not </p><p>necessary to return to Move Safe Lite. EAC also reviewed </p><p>present travel procedures, both for TDYers arriving in Yemen </p><p>and within country travel, and agreed that while the </p><p>community is still under Authorized Departure, no change was </p><p>needed for TDYers.  In country travel procedures will </p><p>continue to be reviewed by the RSO and coordinated with local </p><p>government officials. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
