<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L CARACAS 003882 </p><p> </p><p>USCINCSO ALSO FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/22/09 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: CHAVEZ TO RUN AFTER ALL </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY JOHN F. MAISTO, AMBASSADOR.  REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: CHAVEZ HAS SAID HE WILL STAND FOR REELECTION. </p><p>THE DECEMBER 15 REFERENDUM WILL ONLY CONTAIN ONE QUESTION: ON </p><p>THE APPROVING OR NOT APPROVING THE NEW CONSTITUTION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) REVERSING A POSITION HE HAD PUBLICLY REAFFIRMED EARLIER </p><p>THE SAME DAY, PRESIDENT CHAVEZ ANNOUNCED NOVEMBER 19 THAT HE </p><p>WOULD RUN IN THE GENERAL ELECTIONS TO BE HELD SOME TIME THIS </p><p>SPRING.  DURING HIS CAMPAIGN, ANC PRESIDENT LUIS MIQUILENA WILL </p><p>SERVE AS PRESIDENT.  AS A RESULT OF CHAVEZ\' DECISION, THE </p><p>DECEMBER 15 REFERENDUM WILL CONTAIN ONLY ONE QUESTION FOR THE </p><p>VOTERS: ON WHETHER OR NOT THE APPROVE THE CONSTITUTION.  THERE </p><p>WILL NOT RPT NOT BE -- AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED -- ADDITIONAL </p><p>QUESTIONS ASKING THE VOTER WHETHER CHAVEZ SHOULD BE EXCUSED FROM </p><p>RUNNING, OR WHETHER THE VOTER WANTS THE GOVERNOR OF HIS STATE TO </p><p>RUN. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL HEAD ANDRES CALECA TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THE FOLLOWING THAT HE HAD BEEN SEEKING FOR A WHOLE </p><p>WEEK TO CONVINCE CHAVEZ TO AGREE TO RUN RATHER THAN SEEK </p><p>CONFIRMATION VIA THE REFERENDUM, SINCE THE LEGALITY OF PUTTING </p><p>ANY OTHER QUESTION THAN THAT OF APPROVAL OF THE CONSTITUTION IN </p><p>THE REFERENDUM IS CERTAINLY QUESTIONABLE.  IN ADDITION, CALECA </p><p>NOTES THAT CONFIRMATION OF CHAVEZ IN OFFICE VIA THE REFERENDUM </p><p>WOULD SMACK OF THE PLEBISCITE WITH WHICH DICTATOR MARCOS PEREZ </p><p>JIMENEZ SOUGHT TO LEGITIMIZE HIS RULE IN THE 1950\'S (AND OTHER </p><p>VENEZUELAN DICTATORS BEFORE HIM.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  ASKED WHY CHAVEZ HAD BEEN HESITANT TO RUN, CALECA SAID </p><p>CHAVEZ CITED THE ADDITIONAL COST OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AS </p><p>WELL AS THE DISTRACTION OF HAVING TO CAMPAIGN AT A TIME WHEN </p><p>THERE WAS MUCH SUBSTANTIVE WORK FOR HIM TO DO.  CALECA ALSO </p><p>NOTED THAT CHAVEZ MIGHT FEAR GETTING A LOWER SCORE THAN HE DID </p><p>IN THE LAST ELECTION, DUE TO THE ONGOING DETERIORATION OF THE </p><p>ECONOMIC SITUATION BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT SPRING WHEN THE </p><p>ELECTIONS ARE HELD.  (CALECA SAID HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT NOT BE </p><p>POSSIBLE TO GET THEM ORGANIZED BEFORE APRIL.)  FINALLY, WE HAVE </p><p>ALSO HEARD THAT GOVERNORS OF CHAVEZ POLO PATRIOTICO COALITION </p><p>HAD OBJECTED TO HAVING TO RUN IF HE DID NOT AND WAS NOT </p><p>PROVIDING HIS COATTAILS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAISTO </p><p></p></div>
