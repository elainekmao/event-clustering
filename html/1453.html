<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KINSHASA 008561 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/27/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, PHUM, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: GOMA POLITICAL NOTES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KIGALI 4167 </p><p>     B. KINSHASA 8211 </p><p>     C. KIGALI 4261 </p><p>     D. KINSHASA 4046 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Officer Katherine Simonds.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Goma is not a very political town, despite its status </p><p>as administrative headquarters for the RCD.  While numerous </p><p>general strikes (villes mortes) closed down Bukavu for days </p><p>at a time over the last year, in Goma only one part of the </p><p>city shut down and that for only one day.  Residents of Goma, </p><p>like their countrymen in Kinshasa, are focussed on survival. </p><p>However unhappy they may be with the authorities, they devote </p><p>their energy to getting through each day, rather than to </p><p>political activity.  Nevertheless, during Econoff\'s five-day </p><p>visit to Goma, political themes arose.  This cable (the last </p><p>of the series of reports on the visit) covers political </p><p>issues, including: impressions of the RCD; the absence of </p><p>concrete signs that Rwanda ultimately intends to annex the </p><p>Kivus; the attitudes of Goma residents toward Kabila and </p><p>Kinshasa; and the aborted attempt by a prominent businessman </p><p>to form a new political party.  This cable also touches on </p><p>security issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Impressions of the RCD </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) RCD leaders were eager to meet with Econoff.  The </p><p>RCD\'s Director of External Relations (equivalent to Minister </p><p>of Foreign Affairs) immediately returned econoff\'s call </p><p>although he was at the airport departing for a Joint </p><p>Political Committee meeting.  He asked her to meet with his </p><p>deputy.  The deputy insisted on arranging meetings with the </p><p>RCD\'s Directors of Mines, Finance and Economy, and all three </p><p>made time for the meetings, despite the fact that most of </p><p>their week was taken up with a general meeting of party </p><p>leaders.  Even Secretary General Ruberwa tried to arrange a </p><p>meeting with econoff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The RCD met 6-8 hours a day for three days during </p><p>econoffs visit to formulate an action plan for the party. </p><p>The business community was scornful of the meetings and of </p><p>the RCD in general.  They note that the party has a penchant </p><p>for long meetings that produce little; the RCD met for almost </p><p>a full month soon after it was formed.  Business contacts </p><p>concede that the recent cabinet shuffle (Ref A) improved the </p><p>quality of RCD department heads, but believe that any effort </p><p>at good governance currently underway is too little and too </p><p>late to earn the party popular support.  Many of the people </p><p>with whom econoff discussed the RCD\'s new policy for coltan </p><p>exports (Ref B) are confident that the RCD will back down </p><p>under pressure, as, they say, it has done several times in </p><p>the past. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Congolese Institutions Remain </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) While Rwanda clearly runs the RCD and, through the </p><p>RCD, the Kivus, they have not altered the basic Congolese </p><p>structure of governance.  There is no obvious displacement of </p><p>Congolese institutions by Rwandan institutions, which might </p><p>be expected if Rwanda\'s plans include future annexation of </p><p>the Kivus, as some believe.  Both the RCD\'s Director of </p><p>Finance and the local coordinator of the electricity </p><p>parastatal SNEL briefed econoff on the administrative </p><p>structure of enterprises under their control.  The Finance </p><p>Director said that the RCD controlled parts of eight </p><p>different provinces.  In each province, a governor and </p><p>various state services (e.g. customs and other revenue </p><p>agencies) operate, in accordance with Congolese law.  He said </p><p>all are officially subservient to Kinshasa, but the RCD has </p><p>appointed a coordinator for each agency to control things </p><p>until Kinshasa can take over once again.  The SNEL </p><p>coordinator described his role in similar terms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Nostalgia for Kabila </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) People from all levels of society in Goma were </p><p>interested to hear how things are going in Kinshasa.  Both </p><p>affluent and average Gomans asked about the dollar-franc </p><p>exchange rate in Kinshasa (which is about twice as high as in </p><p>Goma).  Several people told econoff they had heard there was </p><p>"famine" in Kinshasa.  Although Goma suffered some severe </p><p>looting when the AFDL arrived, casual conversation suggests </p><p>that Kabila is popular in Goma.  He gets credit for helping </p><p>to get rid of the refugees who destroyed the local economy. </p><p>A couple of contacts told econoff that there was a brief </p><p>respite from the fear of victimization under Kabila.  One </p><p>commented that for about a year, soldiers got paid, and </p><p>didn\'t need to rob the populace in order to survive.  Another </p><p>commented that the AFDL had executed a few thieves when it </p><p>came through Goma, and subsequently banditry stopped.  There </p><p>is no nostalgia for Mobutu, and his luxurious former </p><p>residence (which now houses RCD offices) is known locally as </p><p>the Museum of Shame. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Birth and Death of a Party </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Victor Ngezayo told econoff about his attempt to form </p><p>a political party, the Congolese Patriotic Movement (MPC) </p><p>(Ref C).  He said he founded the party to create a voice for </p><p>good governance and tolerance.  He believes that the </p><p>Congolese have no faith in democracy and expect nothing from </p><p>government because they have been burdened for 40 years by a </p><p>dysfunctional system.  To launch the MPC, he held a nine-day </p><p>workshop open to everyone, including RCD and Mai Mai, to </p><p>discuss the nature of the current crisis and to look for ways </p><p>to end the war.  Ngezayo sent the declaration the workshop </p><p>produced to the RCD.  His cover letter was conciliatory, </p><p>noting that the MPC shared the values and motivations that </p><p>inspired the RCD\'s 1998 rebellion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ngezayo said that the MPC\'s declaration, which was </p><p>released on the same day the RCD restructured (Ref A), was </p><p>seen as sabotage by party leaders.  Bizima Karaha threatened </p><p>Ngezayo and others with hanging.  Ngezayo said that Karaha </p><p>told him: "This is our territory.  Go conquer your own." </p><p>Ngezayo told econoff he didn\'t want to get anyone killed, so </p><p>he suspended his party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ngezayo gave econoff a copy of the report on his </p><p>workshop prepared for the RCD\'s intelligence service.  The </p><p>memo\'s description of the workshop is remarkably similar to </p><p>Ngezayo\'s.  The memo says the ostensible purpose of the </p><p>workshop was to analyze the current crisis, but the real goal </p><p>was to start a political party "to install democracy and the </p><p>rule of law in the Congo."  The author of the memo, Director </p><p>General of Internal Security Christian Bya-Mweze, warns that </p><p>the MPC could lead some leaders astray and calls for a </p><p>forceful RCD response. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Security Notes </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) While life in Goma is relatively secure, there are </p><p>constant reminders that the situation is dramatically </p><p>different in the rest of North Kivu.  The owner of a </p><p>transportation company was interrupted during lunch by a </p><p>phone call reporting delays due to the ambush of a truck just </p><p>seven kilometers outside town on the road past the airport. </p><p>A coffee buyer from Beni on a visit to Goma mentioned that a </p><p>few nights earlier two people were killed in central Beni. </p><p>He then commented that whenever a couple of UPDF are killed, </p><p>the Ugandans burn villages and kill forty Congolese.  The </p><p>Vice President of the local Chamber of Commerce (FEC) </p><p>mentioned in a similarly offhand manner that he had been </p><p>forced to assume double duties when the local FEC President </p><p>was killed in a road ambush. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Residents of Goma describe a much more complicated </p><p>security picture than is recognized in Kinshasa.  When </p><p>attacks occur by irregular combatants, the perpetrators could </p><p>be members of any of a number of groups: Mai Mai, Mongol, </p><p>Simba, FDD, SPLA, LRA, Ex-FAR, Interhamwe, deserters or </p><p>bandits.  Fixing blame is difficult.  (It is notable that </p><p>those in Goma view the ex-FAR and Interhamwe as two separate </p><p>groups, never linking them casually as is common in </p><p>Kinshasa.)  Asked about reports that the Rwandans have </p><p>created a force of false Interhamwe (Ref D), residents of </p><p>Goma have an open mind.  They don\'t rule out the possibility </p><p>that there is a Rwandan campaign to terrorize local </p><p>residents, but note that these reports may simply refer to </p><p>Rwandan expeditionary forces made up of recently released </p><p>prisoners.  Anything is possible.  The great fear of Goma </p><p>residents is that the Kivu provinces, once referred to as </p><p>"Little Switzerland," will become a land made up of warlords\' </p><p>fiefdoms. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
