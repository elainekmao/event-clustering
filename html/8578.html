<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001166 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS AND AF/S RAYNOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION MASS ACTION IN ZIM; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Weekend editorials concentrated on the five-day </p><p>      anti-government protests, called by the opposition </p><p>      Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), that </p><p>      completely shutdown commerce and industry in the </p><p>      country from June 2 through 6, 2003.  Editorial </p><p>      excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "ZANU-PF digging its own grave" the </p><p>      independent daily "The Daily News" (06/09) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "Faced with glaring evidence of the people of </p><p>      Zimbabwe\'s dissatisfaction with the government, </p><p>      President Robert Mugabe is maintaining a belligerent </p><p>      attitude, threatening the opposition and </p><p>      participants in last week\'s mass action with </p><p>      retribution. . .It must be clear even to the ruling </p><p>      ZANU-PF that such heavy-handedness. . .would again </p><p>      send the wrong signals to local and foreign </p><p>      investors. . .We fully appreciate the government\'s </p><p>      need to show that it is still in charge following a </p><p>      mass action that humiliatingly demonstrated that </p><p>      force alone is keeping the ruling party in power. </p><p>      But we would urge prudence in the aftermath of last </p><p>      week\'s protests, for the good of the nation and </p><p>      indeed for the government\'s own good. . .The </p><p>      government\'s iron-fisted response to the mass action </p><p>      and a violent campaign of retribution in the next </p><p>      few weeks will only harden the people\'s hearts </p><p>      against the ruling party, which is clearly playing </p><p>      into the hands of the opposition\'s hands.  If ZANU- </p><p>      PF continues to display its lack of maturity, it </p><p>      will ultimately dig its own grave. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Tsvangira\'s fate: No one above the </p><p>      law" the government-controlled daily "The Herald" (06/09) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The arrest of MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai for </p><p>      making treasonous statements will reassure </p><p>      Zimbabweans that the justice system is alive and </p><p>      well in the country and the police will not be </p><p>      intimidated by anyone from carrying out its </p><p>      constitutional mandate. . .The AG (Attorney-General) </p><p>      and police should be commended for their boldness in </p><p>      holding Tsvangirai accountable for his actions.  Let </p><p>      the courts decide whether his actions have been </p><p>      lawful or not. . .The arrest of Tsvangirai. . .is a </p><p>      sobering development and a stark reminder that the </p><p>      law in Zimbabwe is not like a cobweb, which may </p><p>      catch small flies but will let wasps and hornets </p><p>      break through.  No one is above the law." </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Admit you are finished" the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Daily News on Sunday" (06/08) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Still, from the intensity of the panic with </p><p>      which the government reacted to the mass </p><p>      action. . .one thing is clear: Mugabe must admit </p><p>      that politically he is finished.  No longer can he </p><p>      stand up and brazenly claim that the people are </p><p>      behind him.  No.  The people are not behind him any </p><p>      more.  They are not even frightened of him or his </p><p>      savage security machinery any more.  They are </p><p>      thoroughly fed up with his misrule and are praying </p><p>      the he will exit the scene while he can still do it </p><p>      with a modicum of dignity and self-respect.  If </p><p>      Mugabe and ZANU-PF dismiss the mass action as a </p><p>      flush in the pan and hope that people will start to </p><p>      sing Mugabe\'s and ZANU-PF\'s praises this week, then </p><p>      the country is headed for a very long period of </p><p>      instability.  If Mugabe does not acknowledge that </p><p>      only through a sincere dialogue with the MDC can the </p><p>      country return to a semblance of the political and </p><p>      economic normalcy before 2000, then he is throwing </p><p>      down the gauntlet and daring the people: what else </p><p>      can you do to me?  The answer to that defiance may </p><p>      be to ghastly to contemplate:" </p><p> </p><p>  5.   Under headline "Confront the real issues Mr. Mugabe: </p><p>      The real threat to your power base Mr. President is </p><p>      not Tsvangirai but the people of Zimbabwe" the </p><p>      independent weekly "The Standard" (06/08) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .As long as the country\'s economy remains in </p><p>      intensive care, your own position will remain </p><p>      vulnerable.  This is the crux of the matter.  You </p><p>      can delude yourself by dismissing the protests as a </p><p>      flop but is this the real issue?  The real issue, </p><p>      Mr. President, is that the people of Zimbabwe are </p><p>      completely dissatisfied and disillusioned with the </p><p>      state of affairs in the country.  Tsvangirai has won </p><p>      the hearts and minds of the Zimbabweans because of </p><p>      this dissatisfaction and disillusionment - pure and </p><p>      simple. . .President Mugabe and the ruling party </p><p>      must neither underrate the mood of the people or </p><p>      their power to change things.  As long as </p><p>      Zimbabweans continue to suffer the way they are </p><p>      doing, the challenge and threat to the President\'s </p><p>      power base remains.  And it will be arrogant and </p><p>      nave in the extreme for the government and its </p><p>      media to gloat that they have scored an immense </p><p>      propaganda victory over Morgan Tsvangirai and the </p><p>      MDC. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  6.   Under headline "Dialogue must resume" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly the "Sunday Mirror" (06/08) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .While the nation is evidently politically </p><p>      polarized, it is an understatement to say the </p><p>      Zimbabweans are united in their hope for a swift </p><p>      improvement in the political and economic condition </p><p>      they find their country in. . .These facts in </p><p>      themselves create an adequate basis for engagement </p><p>      between the two parties (ZANU-PF and MDC).  Any </p><p>      further procrastination on this fundamental issue is </p><p>      definitely not in the national interest.  For, the </p><p>      damage to the already tottering economy and the </p><p>      increasingly violent political culture that is </p><p>      emerging in this country do not bode well for the </p><p>      nation." </p><p> </p><p>  7.   Under headline "Corporates supping with the devil" the </p><p>      government-controlled weekly "The Sunday Mail" (06/08) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .It is clear that the week-long stayaway was </p><p>      successful in terms of business shutdown and not </p><p>      mass action or demonstrations.  The question that </p><p>      then comes to mind is why business chose to become </p><p>      so partisan in an environment where there are two </p><p>      contesting political forces.  What they did amounted </p><p>      to advocating a violent overthrow of a government </p><p>      that they tomorrow will be expecting to work with </p><p>      and calling on to create an environment in which </p><p>      they can prosper.  This is a sign of treacherous </p><p>      naivet that will only result in a souring of </p><p>      relations with the very political force that </p><p>      controls their destiny. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>  8.   Under headline "Tsvangirai loses legitimacy to lead </p><p>      party" the government-controlled daily "The Herald" </p><p>      (06/07) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai has lost all </p><p>      legitimacy to lead the opposition party, having </p><p>      failed to deliver on all political promises he made </p><p>      to his supporters over the past three </p><p>      years. . .Tsvangirai can give all the explanation he </p><p>      wants to justify why no one seriously observed his </p><p>      call for mass marches, but the bottom line is that </p><p>      he failed to unseat the government of President </p><p>      Mugabe. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
