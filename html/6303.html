<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001578 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/12/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, OSCE, PKK </p><p>SUBJECT: ECHR RULING: OCALAN TRIAL UNFAIR, PRISON </p><p>CONDITIONS ACCEPTABLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1303 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 972 </p><p>     C. ADANA 44 </p><p>     D. 02 ANKARA 8881 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The European Court of Human Rights ruled that </p><p>jailed PKK leader Ocalan did not receive a fair trial, while </p><p>also determining that his prison conditions are acceptable. </p><p>Both the GOT and Ocalan\'s attorneys plan to appeal the </p><p>ruling.  Regardless of the outcome of the appeal, Ocalan will </p><p>not be eligible for a re-trial.  The ruling is consistent </p><p>with longstanding U.S. and European criticisms of Turkey\'s </p><p>State Security Court system, where Ocalan was tried.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) March 12 </p><p>issued its decision in a case filed against the GOT on behalf </p><p>of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who was arrested in 1999 and </p><p>is now held in a special prison on Imrali Island in the Sea </p><p>of Marmara.  Ocalan was convicted and sentenced to death, but </p><p>his sentence was commuted to life in prison after the GOT in </p><p>August abolished the death penalty during peacetime.  The </p><p>ECHR found the GOT in violation of certain articles of the </p><p>Council of Europe\'s Convention for the Protection of Human </p><p>Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, while rejecting the </p><p>applicant\'s claims regarding other articles.  The ECHR </p><p>awarded Ocalan 100,000 Euros. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Violations: </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The court found the following violations: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Applicant was not tried before an independent and </p><p>impartial tribunal and was not given a fair trial (Article </p><p>6.1). </p><p>-- Applicant was sentenced to death following an unfair trial </p><p>(Article 3). </p><p>-- Applicant was not brought promptly before a judge (Article </p><p>5.3). </p><p>-- Applicant\'s detention was not quickly reviewed by a judge </p><p>(Article 5.4). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Non-Violations: </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The court found the following non-violations: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The circumstances of applicant\'s transfer to Turkey and </p><p>detention conditions were not unlawful (Article 3). </p><p>-- Applicant\'s arrest and detention were not unlawful </p><p>(Article 5.1). </p><p>-- Applicant\'s right to life and protection from ill </p><p>treatment had not been violated (Articles 2 and 3). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>GOT, Defense Will Appeal </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The MFA issued a terse statement promising an appeal </p><p>to a higher ECHR board.  Kaan Esener, head of the MFA Council </p><p>of Europe Department, told Poloff he was surprised and </p><p>disappointed by the ruling, particularly the court\'s </p><p>determination that the Ankara State Security Court (SSC) </p><p>where Ocalan was tried had not been independent and </p><p>impartial.  (Note: SSCs are special courts that handle crimes </p><p>such as terrorism, drug smuggling, and threats to the State. </p><p>They are permitted to hold closed hearings and admit </p><p>testimony obtained during police interrogation in the absence </p><p>of counsel.  End Note).  Esener said the GOT has three months </p><p>to prepare an appeal to a higher ECHR body, which will render </p><p>a final decision.  He said he was concerned that Ocalan\'s </p><p>supporters might use the ruling to stir trouble.  Ocalan </p><p>attorney Aysel Tugluk told Emboff she welcomed the ECHR\'s </p><p>determination that the trial was unfair.  But she argued the </p><p>court should have determined that Ocalan\'s arrest and </p><p>transfer to Turkey violated extradition rules and constituted </p><p>a kidnapping.  She also said Ocalan\'s sentence violated his </p><p>right to life, regardless of the subsequent abolition of the </p><p>death penalty.  She said the defense will file an appeal. </p><p>Ahmet Turan Demir, chairman of the pro-Kurdish HADEP Party, </p><p>said the verdict presents a chance for the GOT to review its </p><p>judiciary system and improve its relations with the Kurdish </p><p>community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Regardless of the outcome of the appeal, Ocalan will </p><p>not be eligible for a retrial.  As reported Reftel D, recent </p><p>GOT reforms allowing for retrial pursuant to ECHR rulings </p><p>were carefully designed to leave out Ocalan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Detention and Trial Flawed, Prison Conditions Lawful </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The seven-judge ECHR panel criticized the GOT for </p><p>initially including a military judge on the three-judge SSC </p><p>that tried Ocalan.  The SSC replaced the military judge with </p><p>a civilian early in the trial, but the ECHR determined that </p><p>measure inadequate.  (Note:  The lone Turk on the panel filed </p><p>a partially dissenting opinion defending the SSC.  End </p><p>Note.). The court also determined the GOT had improperly </p><p>denied Ocalan access to an attorney while he was held in </p><p>police custody from February 16-23, 1999, during which time </p><p>Ocalan made several incriminating statements.  Authorities </p><p>improperly held Ocalan for seven days before bringing him </p><p>before a judge.  Subsequent attorney visits were held in the </p><p>presence of members of the security forces.  After the first </p><p>two visits, Ocalan\'s contact with attorneys was limited to </p><p>two hours per week.  Prison authorities prevented attorneys </p><p>from providing Ocalan with certain legal documents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) On the other hand, the court determined that Ocalan\'s </p><p>prison conditions do not constitute inhuman or degrading </p><p>treatment.  Ocalan is the sole prisoner held on Imrali </p><p>Island.  Kurdish activists argue that the GOT is isolating </p><p>him inhumanely and have demanded he be transferred to a </p><p>mainland prison.  Jandarma officials prevented attorneys and </p><p>relatives from visiting Ocalan, supposedly due to stormy </p><p>weather (reftels), for a three-and-a-half-month period ending </p><p>March 12, drawing angry protests.  The court also ruled that </p><p>the conditions of Ocalan\'s arrest and transfer from Kenya to </p><p>Turkey were not unduly humiliating. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) This ruling should come as no surprise to the GOT, as </p><p>U.S. and European observers have long argued that the SSC </p><p>system sacrifices individual rights to the interests of the </p><p>State.  The most serious SSC abuses are not in legitimate </p><p>terrorist cases like Ocalan\'s, but rather in the numerous </p><p>cases brought against human rights workers, Kurdish rights </p><p>advocates, journalists, and others charged with threatening </p><p>the State for expressing their views.  There is talk in </p><p>Parliament about introducing a bill that would drastically </p><p>reform the SSCs.  The GOT could significantly improve its </p><p>human rights record, and bring Turkey closer to EU </p><p>membership, by re-making the SSCs into a legitimate forum for </p><p>trying terrorists and dangerous criminals, rather than a tool </p><p>for silencing dissent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
