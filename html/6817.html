<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001967 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBED, EB/ESC, EUR/SE, NEA/NGA, OPS CENTER </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, AJ, GG, ETTC, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IMPACT OF IRAQ OPERATION ON BTC PIPELINE, TPAO </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 400 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by EconCouns Scot Marciel, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) BOTAS General Manager Gokhan Bildaci and BP\'s local </p><p>BTC Co. President Yasar Latifov told us March 25-26 the Iraq </p><p>Operation thus far had not had a serious impact on BTC; </p><p>however, both said they were very concerned that the extra </p><p>burden the war had placed on Turkey\'s infrastructure and </p><p>construction companies could significantly delay BTC </p><p>construction in Turkey.  For example, they said, the Turkish </p><p>railway system was at full capacity transporting </p><p>military-related equipment for both the U.S. and Turkish </p><p>military.  As a result, the national railway company had been </p><p>forced to delay delivery of the BTC pipe provided by the </p><p>Turkish Pipe Consortium, which was produced in the Western </p><p>town of Izmet and was to be transported by railway to the </p><p>pipeline route.  Bildaci said it was not clear how long this </p><p>delay would continue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Bildaci and Latifov both said the Iraq Operation had </p><p>thus far not affected the delivery of BTC pipe at Iskenderun </p><p>port, as they had previously feared (reftel).  However, pipe </p><p>storage at Iskenderun was nearly full, given delays by the </p><p>railway company.  (Note:  Pipe from international sources is </p><p>generally being delivered to Turkey at Iskenderun, and then </p><p>transported to the pipeline route via rail.)  Bildaci said </p><p>the major Turkish construction companies that he had </p><p>sub-contracted had recently told him they may not be able to </p><p>begin BTC construction work April 15 as planned due to </p><p>"unspecified" work they may have to do for the Turkish </p><p>military at that time. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Both Bildaci and Latifov said they were also concerned </p><p>that "construction support" would be delayed because of the </p><p>war.  For example, BOTAS and BTC Co had planned to build many </p><p>construction support camps along the pipeline route. </p><p>However, much of the equipment needed for these sites, such </p><p>as portacabins, was the same equipment currently being used </p><p>by the U.S. and Turkish militaries, which they expected would </p><p>create shortages and delays. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Turkish Petroleum Agency\'s (TPAO\'s) General </p><p>Director for International Projects Orhan Duran told econoff </p><p>March 26 that the Iraq Operation had thus far not had a </p><p>significant impact on BTC, or on TPAO\'s other operations. </p><p>Duran said as long as the Iraq Operation did not affect </p><p>TPAO\'s domestic oil production -- which he did not expect </p><p>would happen -- or cause oil prices to fall below USD 18-20 </p><p>per barrel, it likely would not affect TPAO\'s equities in </p><p>Turkey or the region. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
