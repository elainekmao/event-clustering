THE GOI\'S LEADERSHIP </p><p>WOULD BE IMPORTANT, PIGNATELLI IMPLIED, SINCE IT WAS </p><p>REPRESENTING THE EU PRESIDENCY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF DENMARK </p><p>FROM ECOSOC. </p><p> </p><p>2.    (C) PIGNATELLI CONTINUED THAT THE GOI PREFERED </p><p>"RECIPROCAL ENCOURAGEMENT" OF, NOT CONFRONTATION WITH, STATES </p><p>WITH GOVERNANCE SHORTCOMINGS.  THE GOC HAD "MADE SOME </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS BUT NEEDS TO GO FURTHER."  PIGNATELLI CITED </p><p>BETTER CONDITIONS OF DETENTION AS AN EXAMPLE.

HE HOPED THAT WE </p><p>WOULD DO SO, STATING THAT THE GOI WAS AS CONCERNED BY THE </p><p>RACISM RESOLUTION AS THE USG WAS BY THE CUBA ONE.  ASKED WHY </p><p>THE GOI PREFERRED THAT WE TAKE THE LEAD ON THE RACISM </p><p>RESOLUTION, PIGNATELLI ASSERTED THAT WE HAD CALLED FOR THE </p><p>VOTE IN THE UNCHR, SO IT WAS ONLY LOGICAL THAT WE SHOULD DO </p><p>SO AGAIN.  HE ALSO ASKED WHETHER THE USG WOULD CALL FOR A </p><p>VOTE ON THE CUBA RESOLUTION, IF FOR ANY REASON PERU DID NOT </p><p>DO SO.  POLOFF REPLIED THAT SHE HAD NO INFORMATION ON THIS </p><p>BUT UNDERSCORED THAT THE USG WAS FULLY COMMITTED TO THE </p><p>PASSAGE OF THE CUBA RESOLUTION. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03672 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
