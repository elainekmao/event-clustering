<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001533 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, PHUM, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: LABOR ROUNDUP: ILO PROGRAM; FTA; POVERTY </p><p>ALLEVIATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 313 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 02 03761 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  On March 5, the GOJ and the International </p><p>Labor Organization signed a long-awaited memorandum of </p><p>understanding on a program to develop "internal social </p><p>dialogue."  The three year program (one of two ILO programs </p><p>here) is funded exclusively by the U.S. Department of Labor </p><p>with approximately 1.4 million USD.  Based on our meetings </p><p>with Minister of Labor Muzahim Muhaisin and ILO Regional </p><p>Director Taleb Rifai, we believe the GOJ and ILO are in a </p><p>good position to cooperate on labor issues for the </p><p>foreseeable future. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In our meetings, Rifai focused on the positive impact </p><p>the Free Trade Agreement could have on labor issues here. </p><p>Muhaisin, by contrast, concentrated on programs to alleviate </p><p>poverty and unemployment through vocational training.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>LABOR MINISTER AND ILO ON THE SAME PAGE - FINALLY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On January 14, PolCouns and PolOff met with Taleb </p><p>Rifai, newly appointed Regional Director of the ILO (note: </p><p>Rifai had been Jordan\'s Minister of Tourism prior to the ILO </p><p>appointment - ref a).  PolCouns asked about the status of the </p><p>long-delayed 1.4 million USD ILO program to increase </p><p>communication among labor, management and government, funded </p><p>entirely by the U.S. Department of Labor.  Rifai chalked up </p><p>the delay in the official roll-out of the "internal social </p><p>dialogue" program to personality differences between previous </p><p>ILO personnel and LabMin Muhaisin.  He predicted the program </p><p>would move forward successfully once a memorandum of </p><p>understanding was signed, like the recently launched ILO </p><p>program that focuses on elimination of child labor. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) PolOff and PolCouns subsequently met with Labor </p><p>Minister Muhaisin on January 28.  He admitted the Labor </p><p>Ministry had "made mistakes" at the outset of the social </p><p>dialogue program, but was also ultimately confident the </p><p>program would be a success.  PolCouns noted the USG is </p><p>interested in the ILO program, not only because it is </p><p>entirely funded by the DOL, but because we want to be sure </p><p>that such programs meet the needs of Jordan, and because such </p><p>programs help implement the labor provisions of the US/Jordan </p><p>FTA. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>ILO PROGRAM ON LINE - FINALLY </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) On March 5, the GOJ and ILO signed the long-awaited </p><p>MOU for the social dialogue program.  The program will assist </p><p>in improving communications among labor actors including the </p><p>MOL, unions, workers and factory managers.  The program is </p><p>also designed to enhance collective bargaining, and </p><p>strengthen the capacity of the ministry to enforce </p><p>"fundamental working rights."  The program calls specifically </p><p>for the "enhancement of work and employment conditions for </p><p>both men and women in the Qualifying Industrial Zones." </p><p>Note:  QIZ labor conditions have, and continue to meet, ILO </p><p>standards for work conditions (ref b). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>FREE TRADE AGREEMENT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) During our January meeting, ILO Regional Head Rifai </p><p>made clear he is aware of the FTA, which requires both the US </p><p>and Jordan, as members of the ILO, to ensure that trade is </p><p>not encouraged by relaxing domestic labor laws, or by not </p><p>enforcing existing laws (per Article 6 of the FTA).  Rifai </p><p>characterized Jordanian labor standards as relatively good </p><p>and was confident Jordanian labor laws will not become an </p><p>issue vis-a-vis article 6 of the FTA.  However, Rifai was </p><p>realistic that outside of the QIZs it would be more </p><p>challenging to make immediate improvements to labor </p><p>conditions, since most ventures in Jordan are on a small </p><p>scale, and do not have access to large amounts of capital. </p><p>This contrasts with the QIZs, Rifai said, and their ability </p><p>to centrally manage large numbers of workers and their </p><p>working conditions. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>LABOR MINISTRY: MORE INSPECTORS, MORE VOCATIONAL TRAINING, </p><p>FIGHT POVERTY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  In the January 28 meeting with LabMin, PolCouns </p><p>emphasized the importance of labor standards in the FTA. </p><p>Muhaisin seemed unaware of the FTA provision, and was more </p><p>focused on reducing the demand for foreign labor at the QIZs </p><p>by improving the quality of the local work force via </p><p>vocational training programs.  More jobs would lead to less </p><p>poverty, which is a cornerstone goal of the GOJ.  "Poverty is </p><p>a national issue.  Jordanians like to act as if they are </p><p>rich.  We are not.  We are poor."  Aside from vocational </p><p>training for numerous "blue collar" fields, Muhaisin noted a </p><p>new program, in conjunction with Jordan University, that </p><p>focuses on "white collar" job training.  Muhaisin also said </p><p>the ministry has hired more labor inspectors, bringing the </p><p>total number to 85, and was implementing a program whereby </p><p>inspectors get bonuses for uncovering labor violations. </p><p>Finally, Muhaisin noted that segments of the agricultural </p><p>sector (i.e. engineers) and domestic help are now covered by </p><p>the labor law. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  We were impressed with Rifai\'s knowledge of the </p><p>emerging labor issues of most importance to Jordan in the </p><p>near future, i.e. FTA and QIZ.  He is aware of the linkage </p><p>between the FTA, the growing QIZ textile sector, and the </p><p>resulting emergence of attention from international labor </p><p>NGOs and unions.  Rifai\'s previous experience with the ILO, </p><p>and his familiarity with Jordan and the GOJ should provide </p><p>for a cooperative ILO-GOJ relationship.  We are pleased to </p><p>see the ILO "social dialogue" program finally out of the barn </p><p>and moving into action; as both ILO programs here are funded </p><p>exclusively with Department of Labor money, we will continue </p><p>to monitor them. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) We expect Muhaisin\'s vocational training effort to </p><p>have marginal effects despite his enthusiasm.  Labor and </p><p>business sector contacts tell us the GOJ\'s programs are, at </p><p>best, not as effective as they could be.  The programs are </p><p>generally seen as poorly targeted (i.e. training an equal </p><p>number of textile workers and hair dressers in an economy </p><p>that has a shortage of the former and a surplus of the </p><p>latter) and of inferior quality.  On the other hand, QIZ </p><p>exporters train workers through in-house training over a </p><p>six-week period, often with innovative training techniques. </p><p>They report good results in their efforts to train local </p><p>workers, but have limited floor space and resources to train </p><p>as many Jordanian workers as they would like to have working </p><p>for them.  Most QIZ exporters indicate they would like to </p><p>work with the GOJ to train Jordanian labor, but have not been </p><p>able to communicate effectively with the GOJ on how to best </p><p>achieve this goal. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) USAID has been working with the GOJ on modernizing </p><p>its vocational training system and linking it with current </p><p>market demand.  We will continue to encourage the Ministry to </p><p>communicate better with management and labor in order to </p><p>optimize their vocational training, and we expect the "social </p><p>dialogue" program to provide some help in these efforts. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
