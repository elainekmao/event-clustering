<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000989 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>State for IIP/F/AF Danz/Esquetini; AF/PD </p><p>Skop; and AF/W Martschenko </p><p>Lagos for PAS Lauterbach and Lisenby </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, SCUL, OEXC, KJUS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: Senger Challenges Nigerian Legal Profession to Provide Greater Access to ADR </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Lagos 00778 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  Department of Justice Deputy </p><p>Senior Counsel for Dispute Resolution </p><p>Jeffrey Senger challenged leaders in </p><p>Nigeria\'s courts and executive branch to </p><p>address the practicalities of a court-based </p><p>Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) system </p><p>that could lower costs, bring greater access </p><p>to dispute resolution to average Nigerians </p><p>and alleviate clogged court dockets.  Senger </p><p>was lead speaker on the theme  tandards for </p><p>Alternative Dispute Resolution in Nigeria: </p><p>What Now?" in Abuja on April 5.  Other </p><p>speakers included the Registrar of the </p><p>Supreme Court, the Chief Justice of Kaduna </p><p>State, the President  Special Advisor on </p><p>Legal and Constitutional Matters, the Vice </p><p>President of the Nigerian Bar Association </p><p>and a retired U.S. California state judge </p><p>associated with the USAID Rule of Law </p><p>Program in Abuja.  The audience of 60 </p><p>included a broad spectrum of judicial and </p><p>other GON officials.  Rather than just </p><p>introduce the topic of ADR or train a small </p><p>group based in Lagos, this program assembled </p><p>key individuals and groups critical to </p><p>fostering the institutionalization of ADR </p><p>within the Nigerian judicial process.  This </p><p>is a GPRA report.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Activity Description: A one-day seminar </p><p>on Alternative Dispute Resolution held in </p><p>the Nigerian capital, Abuja.  Senger, who </p><p>served as the lead speaker at this </p><p>conference, was joined by a number of </p><p>distinguished Nigerian and American </p><p>presenters including Dr. Maxwell Gidado, </p><p>Senior Special Assistant to President </p><p>Obasanjo on Legal and Constitutional </p><p>Matters; Justice Rahila Cudjoe of the Kaduna </p><p>State Judiciary; Judge Henry Ramsey, Jr. </p><p>from the U.S. National Center of State </p><p>Courts; and Prince Adetokumbo Kayode, First </p><p>Vice President of the Nigerian Bar </p><p>Association. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Justification and Objective: Over the </p><p>last seven years, Post has sponsored ADR </p><p>projects in support of judicial reform </p><p>efforts in Nigeria.  Through this program, </p><p>PAS Abuja hoped to further strengthen </p><p>Nigeria\'s nascent democracy by encouraging </p><p>government institutions to devise a process </p><p>for setting ADR standards within the </p><p>judicial process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. MPP Umbrella Themes and Audiences </p><p>Reached: NI-PD-01 (Strengthening Democracy). </p><p>The program reached an array of judicial and </p><p>other GON officials, members of the Nigerian </p><p>Bar Association, and journalists.  Also, </p><p>Nigeria\'s largest TV network, the Nigerian </p><p>Television Authority (NTA), gave the program </p><p>unprecedented prominence as the lead story </p><p>on its Network News the day of the seminar. </p><p>NTA Network News boasts over 30 million </p><p>viewers and serves as a primary source of </p><p>information for government officials and the </p><p>country\'s elite. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Immediate Result/Impact: Excellent. </p><p>Previous PAS ADR programs in Nigeria were </p><p>aimed at either providing training or </p><p>increasing understanding of ADR mechanisms. </p><p>Senger\'s program successfully changed that </p><p>focus by addressing the necessary </p><p>qualifications for mediators.  This opened a </p><p>debate among the participants on whether </p><p>mediation should be restricted to lawyers. </p><p>Justice Cudjoe, who traveled 200 kilometers </p><p>to participate in the program, also </p><p>recommended that Nigerian judges encourage </p><p>litigants to explore the use of mediation to </p><p>settle disputes out of court.  Such action </p><p>would provide institutionalization of ADR in </p><p>association with the court system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Date: April 5, 2001 </p><p>Fiscal Year: FY  001 </p><p>Quarter: Third </p><p>7. Non-USG Funding Sources or In-Kind </p><p>Support: N/A </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Quality of U.S. Support: Excellent.  Post </p><p>appreciates the support of IIP/F/AF in </p><p>identifying Senger for this highly </p><p>successful ADR project.  He earned the </p><p>respect of the participants by combining his </p><p>U.S. mediator experience with concrete </p><p>examples of African courts using ADR to </p><p>decongest dockets.  In light of the </p><p>program\'s success, Post would welcome a </p><p>return appearance by Senger to address the </p><p>question of mediation. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
