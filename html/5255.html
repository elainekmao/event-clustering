<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000151 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZANU-PF, MDC YOUTHS CLASH IN HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Youths from the ruling ZANU-PF clashed with counterparts </p><p>from the opposition MDC late on January 20 in Harare\'s </p><p>high-density suburb of Kuwadzana.  Although precise details </p><p>of what occurred remain sketchy, police spokesman Wayne </p><p>Bvudzijena told journalists that one person died from severe </p><p>burns and seven others were seriously injured in a petrol </p><p>bomb attack on a ZANU-PF base.  Sixteen suspects have been </p><p>arrested, all of them MDC youth activists. </p><p> </p><p>2.  MDC spokesman Paul Themba-Nyathi told us that he has </p><p>heard many different accounts of what transpired.  The most </p><p>reliable account, according to Themba-Nyathi, is that an MDC </p><p>supporter was abducted by ZANU-PF militia members on January </p><p>20 and taken to one of five militia base camps recently </p><p>established in the constitutency.  (Note:  The camps were </p><p>established in anticipation of an upcoming parliamentary </p><p>election to fill the seat left vacant by the late party </p><p>spokesman Learnmore Jongwe.  No dates have been set.  End </p><p>Note.)  A group of youths -- whom Themba-Nyathi presumed were </p><p>MDC supporters -- attempted to rescue their colleague, and </p><p>skirmishes ensued.  The MDC spokesman expressed strong </p><p>skepticism that MDC youths had thrown petrol bombs, but he </p><p>acknowledged that residents might have decided finally to </p><p>defend themselves against depredations by the militia, since </p><p>they can no longer rely on the police to protect them. </p><p>Themba-Nyathi said he had issued a statement the morning of </p><p>January 22 condemning violence from any quarter, and told us </p><p>the party has everything to lose if it follows the path of </p><p>violence.  The instruments of force and violence are </p><p>overwhelmingly controlled by one side, he said, and it is </p><p>crucial for the MDC to avoid being painted with the same </p><p>brush as ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) -- an </p><p>umbrella organization dedicated to strengthening transparency </p><p>of elections -- issued a strong condemnation of the clashes </p><p>in Kuwadzana.  In a January 21 press statement, ZESN </p><p>"unreservedly" denounced "all acts of political violence," </p><p>urged "all major political parties campaigning in Kuwadzana </p><p>to strongly condemn any form of violence and desist from </p><p>assaulting people," and urged the government-appointed </p><p>Electoral Supervisory Commission "to ensure that there is a </p><p>violence-free...election." </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  During the past several weeks, the political environment </p><p>in Kuwadzana has worsened considerably, as ZANU-PF pulls out </p><p>all the stops to win the upcoming parliamentary by-election </p><p>in this constituency.  Winning this election is a top </p><p>priority for ZANU-PF, which is determined to regain the </p><p>two-thirds parliamentary majority necessary for amending the </p><p>constitution and is now only five seats away from </p><p>accomplishing that objective.  The ruling party is well aware </p><p>that it has little support in a constituency won </p><p>overwhelmingly by the late Learnmore Jongwe with more than 75 </p><p>percent of the votes in 2000, so is falling back on its </p><p>tried-and-true tactics of intimidation and control of food </p><p>distribution.  As urban residents, however, the people of </p><p>Kuwadzana are much less vulnerable to intimidation than their </p><p>rural counterparts, and many of them despise a ruling party </p><p>they believe played a role in the death of Jongwe, who was a </p><p>very popular figure in this high-density suburb.  The MDC\'s </p><p>selection of candidate Nelson Chamisa, national youth leader </p><p>and a hardliner who does not shrink from a fight, only adds </p><p>to the potential volatility of the Kuwadzana campaign. </p><p> </p><p>5.  As we indicated earlier, the details of the January 20 </p><p>clashes remain unclear.  We would not be surprised, however, </p><p>if MDC supporters had had enough of the militia\'s </p><p>intimidation and decided to retaliate or to teach them a </p><p>lesson.  Similar incidents are likely in the run-up to the </p><p>election, and we expect political violence from both sides </p><p>will intensify once election dates are announced.   The MDC\'s </p><p>issuance of a statement condemning violence committed by any </p><p>source is positive, and the Department might want to be </p><p>prepared to make a similar declaration. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
