<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000289 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, EU, IT, ITPREL </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI PRE-GAERC VIEWS ON IRAQ, DPRK, BALKANS, ESDP, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00289  01 OF 02  241501Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 18030 B) STATE 20813 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON: 1. </p><p>5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  ON JANUARY 23 AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>POL MC COUNTRYMAN, DELIVERED POINTS REF A TO MFA SYG GIUSEPPE </p><p>BALDOCCI AND COORDINATOR FOR EU SECURITY SANDRO DE BERNADIN. </p><p>HE ALSO PROVIDED THE POINTS IN A NON-PAPER.  BALDOCCI SAID </p><p>THAT MFA FRATTINI WAS "VERY PLEASED, VERY SATISFIED" WITH THE </p><p>"PRODUCTIVE, OPEN DIALOGUE" DURING HIS JANUARY 21 MEETING IN </p><p>WASHINGTON WITH SECRETARY POWELL.  BALDOCCI HOPED THAT THIS </p><p>WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF FREQUENT "DIRECT CONTACT" BETWEEN </p><p>THE MINISTERS.  BALDOCCI STRESSED THAT THE GOI, EU, AND USG </p><p>HAD THE SAME GOALS ON ALL REF A ISSUES, THOUGH THERE WERE </p><p>SLIGHT DISCREPANCIES ON THE MEANS BY WHICH THE GOALS WOULD BE </p><p>REALIZED.  HE AGREED THAT THE PRESSURE MUST BE KEPT ON </p><p>BAGHDAD, AND PROMISED THAT THE GOI WOULD WORK FOR A STRONG, </p><p>UNIFIED STATEMENT FROM THE GAERC.  THE EU WAS ALSO READY TO </p><p>BE HELPFUL IN ANY DIALOGUE WITH THE NORTH KOREANS.  THE GREEK </p><p>AND ITALIAN PRESIDENCIES WOULD TRY TO "REFOCUS" EU ATTENTION </p><p>ON THE BALKANS, AND THE GOI WOULD LIKELY PLAY A MAJOR PART IN </p><p>ANY ESDP DEPLOYMENT TO MACEDONIA.  THE GOI BELIEVES THAT </p><p>THERE IS SUFFICIENT SUPPORT IN THE EU TO MAINTAIN SANCTIONS </p><p>AGAINST ZIMBABWE.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00289  01 OF 02  241501Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  BALDOCCI AGREED THAT IRAQ WAS NOT JUST AN AMERICAN </p><p>OR TRANSATLANTIC ISSUE, BUT AN INTERNATIONAL THREAT OF GREAT </p><p>SERIOUSNESS.  HE INSISTED THAT THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES </p><p>(INCLUDING GERMANY AND FRANCE) UNDERSTAND THIS, AND AGREE </p><p>THAT THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DISARM SADDAM, EVEN THOUGH THERE </p><p>MAY BE DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION ON HOW </p><p>TO IMPLEMENT THAT POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  BALDOCCI EMPHASIZED THAT THERE SHOULD BE "NO MESSAGE </p><p>OF DIVISION" IN THE GAERC STATEMENT.  IT MUST STRESS "UNITY </p><p>AND PRESSURE."  THE GOI WOULD DO WHAT IT COULD TO UNIFY THE </p><p>15.  COUNTRYMAN CAUTIONED BALDOCCI THAT UNITY OFTEN MEANT A </p><p>"LEAST COMMON DENOMINATOR" STATEMENT, WHICH IN THIS CASE </p><p>COULD MEAN A CALL FOR ANOTHER UNSC RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE </p><p>USE OF FORCE AGAINST IRAQ. A WEAK STATEMENT COULD ALSO BE </p><p>INTERPRETED IN BAGHDAD AS IC ACQUIESCENCE TOWARDS ADDITIONAL </p><p>MONTHS, OR YEARS, OF CONTINUED IRAQI STALLING ON COMPLIANCE </p><p>WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS TO DISARM.  BALDOCCI SAID </p><p>THAT HE WOULD CONVEY TO FRATTINI USG VIEWS THAT WE MUST SPEAK </p><p>WITH ONE CLEAR, STRONG VOICE, AND KEEP THE PRESSURE ON </p><p>SADDAM.  (SEPTEL WILL REPORT ON JAN. 24 DEMARCHE REQUESTED IN </p><p>REF B). </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>NORTH KOREA </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  BALDOCCI SAID THAT THE GOI CONCURRED WITH U.S. </p><p>POLICY AS PRESENTED IN REF A.  FRATTINI WOULD BE MEETING WITH </p><p>CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER TANG JIAXUAN ON JANUARY 24 IN ROME, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00289  01 OF 02  241501Z </p><p>AND NORTH KOREA WILL BE ON THE AGENDA.  WE NEED A COMMITMENT </p><p>FORM NORTH KOREA TO COMPLY WITH ITS COMMITMENTS UNDER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, CONTINUED DE BERNADIN.  HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE GREEK EU PRESIDENCY SHARED OUR APPROACH TOWARDS </p><p>DPRK, AND AGREED ON THE NEED TO KEEP THE PRESSURE ON </p><p>PYONGYANG.  THE EU WAS READY TO BE HELPFUL IN ANY DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH THE NORTH KOREANS, AND WAS NOW CONSIDERING DEPLOYMENT OF </p><p>A MISSION TO PYONGYANG.  THE ISSUE WILL COME UNDER DISCUSSION </p><p>AT THE EU TROIKA-RUSSIA MEETING ON JANUARY 24. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>BALKANS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  DE BERNADIN SAID THAT THE EU CONCURS ON THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF ICTY COOPERATION FOR GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>REGION.  THE GREEK AND ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCIES WOULD TRY TO </p><p>"REFOCUS" ATTENTION ON THE BALKANS NOW THAT "ENLARGEMENT EAST </p><p>WAS IN ITS FINAL STAGES".  USG OFFERS TO COOPERATE ON BALKANS </p><p>ISSUES, PARTICULARLY ON ORGANIZED CRIME, WERE "MUSIC TO OUR </p><p>EARS," SAID BALDOCCI. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1030 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00289  02 OF 02  241501Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------2B0C70  241501Z /38 </p><p>O 241430Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7809 </p><p>INFO EU CANDIDATE STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU INTEREST COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>CIA WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000289 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: GOI PRE-GAERC VIEWS ON IRAQ, DPRK, BALKANS, ESDP, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00289  02 OF 02  241501Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>ESDP </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS, SAID DE BERNADIN, BUT </p><p>ONLY A FEW ISSUES REMAINED TO BE IRONED OUT ON BERLIN PLUS, </p><p>THEN THE EU WOULD BE READY TO DEPLOY.  HE HOPED THAT </p><p>DISCUSSIONS COULD BE COMPLETED AS EARLY AS THE END OF </p><p>FEBRUARY.  MACEDONIA\'S REQUEST FOR AN ESDP POST-TASK FORCE </p><p>FOX MILITARY DEPLOYMENT SHOULD ACT AS A CATALYST FOR THE </p><p>PROCESS.

(C)  DE BERNADIN THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT </p><p>SUPPORT IN THE EU TO MAINTAIN SANCTIONS.  THE ONLY </p><p>COMPLICATING FACTOR WAS THE JULY EU-AFRICA SUMMIT IN LISBON. </p><p>HE HOPED THAT OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES WOULD NOT BOYCOTT THE </p><p>SUMMIT IF MUGABE WAS DENIED A VISA.  POL MC NOTED THAT IT </p><p>WOULD BE THE AFRICANS, NOT THE EU, WHO WOULD LOSE MORE FROM A </p><p>BOYCOTT.  IF THE EU WANTED TO DEMONSTRATE SERIOUSNESS ABOUT </p><p>ZIMBABWE, IT SHOULD BE PREPARED TO STAND FIRM ON THIS POINT. </p><p>(POL MC HAD EARLIER RAISED THE ZIMBABWE POINTS WITH MFA </p><p>DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR AFRICA BRUNO CABRAS, WHO SAID HE </p><p>EXPECTED THE SANCTIONS TO BE RENEWED, THOUGH WITH SOME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00289  02 OF 02  241501Z </p><p>MODIFICATIONS (NFI). </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00289 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
