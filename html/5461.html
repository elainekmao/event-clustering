This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for January 31, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  MERVAN GUL IS RESIGNING TO OPEN WAY FOR </p><p>ERDOGAN </p><p>(Milliyet)  AK Party is pressing the button today </p><p>(1/31) to make it possible for its leader Recep </p><p>Tayyip Erdogan to become prime minister.  Mervan </p><p>Gul, AK Party\'s first-listed candidate in the </p><p>March 9 Siirt elections, is submitting his </p><p>resignation to the Higher Election Council (YSK) </p><p>today, to step aside for Erdogan.  Erdogan\'s </p><p>name, instead of Gul\'s, will be reported to YSK </p><p>by February 6.  AK Party has decided that there </p><p>is no need for its two other Siirt candidates to </p><p>resign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  WAR PREPARATIONS AT INCIRLIK </p><p>(Radikal)  While the U.S. is counting days prior </p><p>to a possible attack against Iraq, foodstuffs and </p><p>water are being stockpiled at the Incirlik Air </p><p>Base (Adana).  U.S. officials are buying drinking </p><p>water from Pinar Group, an affiliate of the Yasar </p><p>Holding Food Group.  Yasar Holding Food Group </p><p>President Ahmet Arsan pointed to increased demand </p><p>(for his water) from the Southeast and provinces </p><p>along the Iraqi border.  Adana Bar Association </p><p>President Necati Erdem described the developments </p><p>regarding a possible Iraq operation as worrisome. </p><p>Hurriyet reported increased exercises at </p><p>Incirlik, where U.S. and British passenger planes </p><p>landed for military personnel transfer. </p><p>Cumhuriyet reported many planes landed at </p><p>Incirlik, while journalists were trying to film </p><p>developments there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  ANTI-WAR SENTIMENTS </p><p>(Bolge/Milliyet)  Ali Batman, President of the </p><p>Adana chapter of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable </p><p>Merchants Chamber, claimed war rumors have had a </p><p>negative impact on the fresh fruit and vegetable </p><p>sector, leading to the suspension of business </p><p>activities of 110 merchants over the past two </p><p>months.  In a meeting at the Mersin chapter of </p><p>the Turkish Agriculturalists\' Association, the </p><p>Association\'s National President, Ibrahim Yetkin, </p><p>said the agricultural sector would be most </p><p>affected in the event of U.S.-led war in Iraq. </p><p>Nearly 20 members of the Adana Bar Association </p><p>gathered in Adana\'s Ataturk Park to protest the </p><p>possible U.S.-led war in Iraq.  Hurriyet reported </p><p>that fifth graders of Adana\'s Hurriyet Primary </p><p>School scribbled "No To War" and "Yes To Peace" </p><p>on sheets of paper and displayed them on their </p><p>classroom windows.  Turkiye quoted Adana </p><p>researcher-historian Ejder Dilci as saying that </p><p>history was repeating itself regarding Iraq, </p><p>against which the U.S. is preparing to launch an </p><p>operation.  According to Dilci, Germany asked </p><p>Turkey for permission to enter Iraq through </p><p>Turkey in 1941.  He added that U.S. had requested </p><p>permission from the Turkish government to enter </p><p>Iraq.  Evrensel reported that Mersin merchants </p><p>would wear black ribbons today (1/31) to say "No" </p><p>to war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  MERSIN PORT CLOSED TO FISHERMEN </p><p>(Evrensel)  Fishing around the Mersin Port, which </p><p>the U.S. wants to use during a possible attack </p><p>against Iraq, has been banned since January 27. </p><p>A U.S. delegation had previously surveyed the </p><p>port.  Fishermen criticized the ban, saying "we </p><p>cannot freely move about and fish in our seas." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  INCREASED MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN CIZRE </p><p>(SIRNAK) </p><p>Hurriyet and Milliyet reported increased </p><p>activities at the Cizre (Sirnak) Tank Battalion, </p><p>following the dispatch by the Turkish General </p><p>Staff (TGS) of additional equipment and materials </p><p>to the Diyarbakir-based Second Army, which is </p><p>responsible for the Iraqi border.  Some of the </p><p>Battalion\'s tanks are now in open fields ready </p><p>for deployment along the border.  Also, military </p><p>vehicles have begun to dispatch foodstuffs from </p><p>Cizre to units along the border.  Evrensel cited </p><p>Sirnak Governor Huseyin Baskaya as saying that an </p><p>exercise would soon be carried out near the </p><p>province\'s Habur border gate against a possible </p><p>influx of Iraqi refugees in the aftermath of a </p><p>possible U.S.-led operation against Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  DEPLOYMENT ALONG IRAQI BORDER </p><p>(Cumhuriyet)  Military units, following the </p><p>abolition of the State of Emergency (OHAL) in the </p><p>Southeast, are being re-deployed to the Iraqi </p><p>border.  Military units affiliated with the Van </p><p>Public Order Command, the Kayseri Airborne </p><p>Command, the 18th Border Command, and the Third </p><p>Army have been dispatched to Sirnak through Van. </p><p>Milliyet reported that "critical" personnel who </p><p>had been transferred from the (Malatya-based) </p><p>Second Army to Western provinces might sent back </p><p>to Malatya on TDY or re-appointed to their </p><p>previous positions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  BODY OF BRITISH VICTIM OF PLANE CRASH </p><p>MISTAKENLY BURIED IN ISTANBUL </p><p>(Sabah)  The body of U.K. citizen Christopher </p><p>Ringland, who lost his life during a plane crash </p><p>in Diyarbakir earlier this month, was reportedly </p><p>mistaken for that of businessman Nurullah Eren, </p><p>who was owner of the Eren Holding Company and the </p><p>Turkish Lacoste firm.  The body had been buried </p><p>at the Karacaahmet Cemetery in Istanbul.  When </p><p>officials found out about the error, Ringland\'s </p><p>body was taken out of the grave and sent to the </p><p>U.K. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  TGS PREPARES ANTI-KADEK ALBUM:  UNFORGOTTEN </p><p>PHOTOGRAPHS </p><p>(Dunya)  Turkish General Staff (TGS) has prepared </p><p>an anti-KADEK album entitled "Separatist Terror </p><p>Organization:  Unforgotten Photographs" and </p><p>distributed it to press organizations.

DEHAP OFFICIALS INDICTED FOR KURDISH SONGS </p><p>(Evrensel)  DEHAP, Labor Party (EMEP), and Human </p><p>Rights Association (HRA) Elazig officials have </p><p>been indicted for having remained indifferent to </p><p>Kurdish-language songs and pro-DEHAP slogans </p><p>during their November 3 election campaigns.

In Diyarbakir, 21 people </p><p>participated in a hunger strike launched by a </p><p>group of three women, all members of the </p><p>Prisoners and Inmates Families Initiative.  Also, </p><p>a group of Initiative members held a press </p><p>conference at the Seyhan (Adana) chapter of DEHAP </p><p>during which they declared that they had started </p><p>a hunger. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.

BOMB MAKERS RE-ARRESTED </p><p>(Turkiye)  A Gaziantep court ordered the arrest </p><p>of two of the three people who had been released </p><p>after being arrested for possession of TNT and </p><p>other materials used in making bombs.

ADANA HISTORIAN SAYS ARMENIANS CARRIED OUT </p><p>THE MASSACRE </p><p>(Turkiye)  During the "Armenians and Armenian </p><p>Massacre in History" conference jointly organized </p><p>by the Adana Governor\'s Office, the Ceyhan </p><p>(Adana) district Governor\'s Office, and the Adana </p><p>National Education Directorate, researcher- </p><p>historian Cezmi Yurtsever claimed that Armenians </p><p>were trying to misrepresent the massacres they </p><p>carried out in Cukurova (Adana) and Anatolia </p><p>between 1892-1922 as if they themselves had been </p><p>subjected to those massacres.  In those years, </p><p>Armenians attacked Camili village, Adana\'s </p><p>largest village, and tortured hundreds of people </p><p>to death. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.  "PULUMUR RESIDENTS FREEZING TO DEATH" </p><p>(Radikal/Milliyet/Evrensel)  Four days have </p><p>passed since the January 27 earthquake in </p><p>Tunceli\'s Pulumur district, but earthquake </p><p>victims have not been provided with tents </p><p>suitable for winter conditions there.
