<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002447 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KPAL, ASEC, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: AL-NAKHBA DAY PASSES QUIETLY IN JORDAN -- WAITING </p><p>FOR A POLITICAL PROCESS? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Traditionally a day of protests in Jordan, the May </p><p>15 remembrance of al-Nakhba (the "Catastrophe" -- the 1948 </p><p>founding of Israel) passed quietly in Jordan this year.  The </p><p>Professional Associations sponsored a pro-Palestinian rally </p><p>in the Shmeisani neighborhood of Amman.  A large number of </p><p>police watched over the peaceful rally, but did not </p><p>interfere.  UNRWA sources indicate that Jordan\'s refugee </p><p>camps were quiet, with the exception of the Baqaa camp north </p><p>of Amman, where a "spontaneous demonstration" tried </p><p>unsuccessfully to reach the main Amman-Irbid highway. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In a May 15 meeting, GOJ Department of Palestinian </p><p>Affairs Director General Abdulkarim Abulhaija had told </p><p>refcoord he expected Nakhba day to pass quietly in Jordan. </p><p>The GOJ was not aware of any large demonstrations planned in </p><p>the camps.  In general, Abulhaija said, "this is a moment of </p><p>calm in Jordan," as everyone is waiting, hopefully, for a </p><p>political process to restart and take root.  Abulhaija, who </p><p>had just completed several days of meetings with camp </p><p>leadership throughout the Amman area, said refugees are even </p><p>talking about the need to avoid violence -- particularly in </p><p>the West Bank -- to ensure that a political dialogue can </p><p>begin and be successful.  Noting that refugees just a few </p><p>weeks ago had been highly critical of the U.S., Abulhaija </p><p>said they are now talking about the "independence" of the </p><p>U.S. Administration and its apparent willingness to "stand </p><p>up" to pro-Israeli interests.  Abulhaija added that the U.S. </p><p>now needed to deliver.  If political progress is not made in </p><p>the next few weeks, or if Israel launches significant new </p><p>military assaults, he believes the mood could rapidly turn in </p><p>the camps and in the broader Arab street. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  In contrast, however, UNRWA staff told RefFSN that a </p><p>group of refugees in Baqaa camp said this week that they </p><p>blamed the United States for Israel\'s occupation of the West </p><p>Bank and Gaza and were upset to learn that a U.S. delegation </p><p>had recently visited the camp. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  This year\'s Nakhba Day passed with barely a whimper, </p><p>especially as compared to the clashes that took place last </p><p>year on May 11 in the run-up to al-Nakhba.  In the wake of </p><p>Israel\'s withdrawal from West Bank cities and with the daily </p><p>dose of images of Palestinian suffering reduced, Jordanians </p><p>seem to be waiting to see if U.S. and international </p><p>statements about the need for a political process and </p><p>creation of a Palestinian state will be acted on. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
