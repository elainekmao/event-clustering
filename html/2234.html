<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002987 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/26/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, OPRC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED ON BIAFRA HOUSE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2982 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 6. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: During a November 11 meeting with Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, NSA Aliyu Mohammed urged the United States to stop a </p><p>U.S.-based organization from calling itself the "Embassy of </p><p>Biafra," and from broadcasting the "Voice of Biafra" to </p><p>Nigeria.  After referring to the freedom of speech protection </p><p>granted by the U.S. Constitution, Ambassador Jeter explained </p><p>that we would look into the matter quickly.  Action requested </p><p>in para 6.  Draft press release in para 7.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The NSA stated flatly that the Biafra House, "Embassy </p><p>of Biafra" situation, concerned the GON a great deal.  They </p><p>now had a radio station, "The Voice of Biafra," broadcasting </p><p>from Washington to Nigeria.  After losing over one million </p><p>people in its civil war, and then putting the conflict behind </p><p>it, Nigeria did not want to relive this piece of its history. </p><p> The NSA enjoined the Ambassador to "do something" to stop </p><p>the group from calling itself an Embassy and broadcasting to </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador Jeter, noting that President Obasanjo had </p><p>discussed this matter with Secretary Powell during his </p><p>November 2 visit to Washington, explained that the protection </p><p>of freedom of speech in the United States gave groups wide </p><p>latitude as to what they might call themselves.  However, the </p><p>Biafra House was not an accredited Embassy to the United </p><p>States, nor were they being treated as one.  Jeter informed </p><p>the NSA that we would look into the matter urgently to see </p><p>what, if anything, could be done.  On November 26, visiting </p><p>Nigerian Ambassador to Washington, Jibril Aminu, called </p><p>Ambassador Jeter to relay President Obasanjo\'s continuing </p><p>concern over this issue.  Obasanjo, Aminu related, felt very </p><p>strongly about this matter because he had led Nigerian forces </p><p>during the civil war and wanted the matter of Biafra closed, </p><p>now and forever. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: The misrepresentation that there is an </p><p>"Embassy of Biafra" in the United States deeply concerns the </p><p>GON leadership.  The GON sees the "Embassy of Biafra" as an </p><p>attempt to foment separatism, and to undermine the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration.  Given the tragedy of the Nigerian Civil War, </p><p>any representation of Biafra as a diplomatic entity provokes </p><p>strong emotional reaction from the GON senior leadership, </p><p>some of whom, like President Obasanjo and NSA Mohammed, were </p><p>military officers at the time of the war.  They </p><p>understandably want to nip this in the bud before it spurs </p><p>more separatist agitation from this or any other group. </p><p>(While separation is not a strong political force, such </p><p>public agitation could unduly rile ethnic tensions at a time </p><p>when everything should be done to calm the waters.)  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ACTION REQUEST: Because it is an important issue for </p><p>Nigeria (it was the only point raised by the NSA in the </p><p>meeting and the first issue raised by President Obasanjo in </p><p>his meeting with Secretary Powell), we believe the USG should </p><p>make a clear statement regarding Biafra House.  The Embassy </p><p>requests that the Department approve the issuance of the </p><p>press release in Para 7.  We also ask the Department to find </p><p>out whether Biafra House is broadcasting in accordance with </p><p>applicable U.S. law and regulations.  The broadcasts are </p><p>being transmitted on short-wave at 12.125 MHz.  The address </p><p>of Biafra House is Suite 700, No 733, 15th Street NW.  The </p><p>phone number is 202-347-2983.  END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) BEGIN PROPOSED PRESS RELEASE: It has come to the </p><p>attention of the Embassy and the Government of the United </p><p>States that an organization has been publicly representing </p><p>itself in the United States as the "Embassy of Biafra." </p><p>Neither the Embassy nor the Government of the United States </p><p>recognizes the existence of any organization by that name. </p><p>This group does not have diplomatic status in the United </p><p>States, nor does the United States recognize any such group </p><p>as representing any known government.  Whatever confusion </p><p>resulting from the group incorrectly referring to itself as </p><p>an Embassy is unacceptable.  We disapprove of such false </p><p>misrepresentation and urge the organization to take the steps </p><p>necessary to end the confusion that it has caused.  We also </p><p>take this opportunity to reaffirm our friendship toward the </p><p>Nigerian people, our full recognition of the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration, and our respect for the territorial integrity </p><p>and indivisible sovereignty of the Federal Republic of </p><p>Nigeria.  END PROPOSED PRESS RELEASE. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
