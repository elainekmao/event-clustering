<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008535 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/22/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, SW, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: POSSIBLE VISIT BY SWEDISH FM COULD BOOST </p><p>AK\'S HUMAN RIGHTS IMAGE </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. Kass. </p><p>Reason: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Anne Dismoor, Swedish Ambassador to Turkey, told </p><p>poloff at a November 20 reception that she was hopeful </p><p>Swedish FM Lindh would visit Turkey soon.  According to </p><p>Dismoor, Lindh canceled her trip last year after GOT </p><p>officials stated she would have to cancel a planned visit to </p><p>Diyarbakir, a southeastern province under a state of </p><p>emergency, due to the possibility of "bad press."  Dismoor </p><p>commented that during a meeting last week AK Party Chairman </p><p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed puzzlement over why Lindh felt </p><p>forced to cancel her trip and stated she should be able to </p><p>visit Diyarbakir.  Erdogan further indicated that Lindh would </p><p>be given all accommodations should she choose to visit </p><p>Turkey.  Dismoor said Erdogan was scheduled to go to Sweden </p><p>next November 27 and implied plans for a visit to Turkey by </p><p>Lindh may be discussed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Comment: Sweden has at times been among the leading </p><p>critics of Turkey\'s human rights record.  A visit to the </p><p>troubled southeast by Lindh at this time would highlight the </p><p>AK Party\'s efforts to portray itself as willing to break with </p><p>the past on this issue.  After assuming office, Interior </p><p>Minister Aksu immediately issued a message to all governors </p><p>stressing the importance of combating torture, abduction, </p><p>excessive force, and extrajudicial killing.  The AK party </p><p>also elevated the status of human rights in the Cabinet by </p><p>appointing a Deputy PM, Ertugrul Yalcinbayir, as Minister for </p><p>Human Rights; the GOT had previously assigned a State </p><p>Minister to this role. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
