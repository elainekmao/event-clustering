"Sabah" carries Defense Minister </p><p>Gonul\'s statement saying that the US had asked Turkey for </p><p>troops and technical staff to be sent to Iraq.  However, </p><p>"Hurriyet" reports that FM Gul denied Gonul\'s statement by </p><p>saying that Turkey had not received any requests from the </p><p>US.  "Hurriyet" reports that the MFA issued a statement last </p><p>evening saying that `on March 26, the US asked coalition </p><p>countries to give details on possible contributions they </p><p>could make to the reconstruction of Iraq.  Turkey closely </p><p>follows developments regarding the reconstruction and </p><p>stabilization of Iraq, and will exert every effort to meet </p><p>its responsibilities.\'  All papers report that Iraq\'s six </p><p>neighboring countries will meet in Riyadh today to debate </p><p>the future of Iraq.  Turkish FM Gul will attend the meeting. </p><p>"Hurriyet" reports that A/S Grossman, responding Hurriyet\'s </p><p>questions in Washington, said that `Kurdish leaders should </p><p>be careful about their stance against Turkey. They should be </p><p>conscious of their words and behavior.  Turkey is Iraq\'s </p><p>neighbor. Therefore, Iraqi Kurds should be transparent </p><p>regarding the issue of PKK-KADEK terrorism.\'  Grossman added </p><p>that there are no obstacles to the $1 billion aid package, </p><p>and that it is only natural that Turkey will have a role in </p><p>Iraq\'s reconstruction.  "Radikal" reports that Secretary of </p><p>State Colin Powell is planning a trip to Syria to learn the </p><p>truth about allegations that Syria is sheltering Iraqi </p><p>leaders and to ask for their extradition. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: "Sabah" reports on Powell\'s comments that the EU </p><p>should begin accession negotiations with Turkey in 2004 if </p><p>Turkey meets the Copenhagen Criteria.  Speaking at a </p><p>reception at the Greek Embassy in Washington, Powell </p><p>welcomed the EU expansion and said the US will exert every </p><p>effort for a solution of the Cyprus issue.  "Sabah" also </p><p>reports on EU diplomats\' comments at the EU summit in Athens </p><p>that the accession negotiations could begin before 2004, </p><p>depending on Turkey\'s efforts to meet the criteria. </p><p>"Milliyet" reports that the EU was extra careful not to </p><p>upset Turkey by using the word "occupier," instead referring </p><p>to Northern Cyprus as an `uncontrolled-zone.\' "Radikal" </p><p>notes that the signing of the treaty with the Greek Cypriot </p><p>side has divided the island, triggering happiness and </p><p>excitement in the south and disappointment and chaos in the </p><p>north. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Pride, dignity, reason" </p><p>Yagmur Atsiz noted in mass appeal HO-Tercuman (4/18): "By </p><p>pursuing an idiotic and awkward policy during the Iraq </p><p>campaign, Ankara has managed to degrade Turkey from the </p><p>position of `regional superpower and strategic partner\' to </p><p>`potential adversary.\'  The White House will never forget </p><p>it, and will not hesitate a moment to dupe Turkey when the </p><p>time becomes ripe for revenge.  Contrary to claims by some </p><p>incautious anti-Americans, Ankara has not carried out an </p><p>honorable policy, but totally upset American plans and </p><p>wasted the opportunity to become a real player in Northern </p><p>Iraq, then by assisting the war indirectly, has drawn the </p><p>fury of the Arabs. .  Washington has not closed the Turkey </p><p>chapter, because Americans need Turkey for Syria and Iran, </p><p>Central Asia and the Caucasus.  However, this is merely a </p><p>`geographical\' need.  The conflict has  shown the `quality\' </p><p>of our politicians, that they are not a `team,\' but rather a </p><p>bunch of opportunists lying in wait to annihilate each </p><p>other. .  The U.S. does not want a Kurdish state, not in </p><p>deference to Turkish interests, but simply to avoid Kurds </p><p>massacring each other when they are given independence.  It </p><p>is unlikely that Turkey\'s Kurds would prefer to integrate </p><p>with the Iraqi Kurds.  Would Turks want to join </p><p>Turkmenistan?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"AKP renounces a Cyprus solution" </p><p>Metin Munir observed in mass appeal Sabah (4/18): "The AKP </p><p>leadership is very afraid of Denktas and is not willing to </p><p>get into a fight with the military on Cyprus.  Furthermore, </p><p>the AKP believes the EU won\'t admit Turkey even if the </p><p>Cyprus problem is resolved. .  If two rightist parties fully </p><p>supportive of Denktas emerge as winners from the general </p><p>election in Northern Cyprus this year, current policies will </p><p>continue unchanged.  The situation might change if the </p><p>Republican Turkish Party (CTP) wins the elections.  They </p><p>have declared their intention to sack Denktas as negotiator, </p><p>and to re-start talks within the framework of the UN plan </p><p>for Cyprus. .  However, even if it took power in the Turkish </p><p>sector, the CTP will see that Ankara has the last word. </p><p>Moreover, Turkey cannot, as before, depend on U.S. support </p><p>on Cyprus.  The AKP has alienated Turkey in the </p><p>international arena." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Irony of war" </p><p>Etyen Mahcupyan defends in Islamic/intellectual Zaman </p><p>(4/18): "A realistic point of view shows that Turkey is not </p><p>actually powerful enough, that nobody trusted Turkey, that </p><p>our troops are not welcome in Northern Iraq, and that the </p><p>Northern Iraqi (Kurdish) administration has a more </p><p>legitimate position than we do. .  Being too dependent on </p><p>the U.S. might bring tension for the Kurds in relation to </p><p>the Shiites.  It will be problematic to produce `autonomy\' </p><p>from a war that was viewed as illegitimate around the world. </p><p>The Kurds are stuck between their national dreams and the </p><p>legitimacy of making this dream a reality.  Maybe this war </p><p>was the final irony for the illusion of a Kurdish `nation- </p><p>state.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
