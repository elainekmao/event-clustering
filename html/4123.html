<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 KATHMANDU 002057 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, MARR, MASS, NP, PRELPHUMP </p><p>SUBJECT: SA DAS CAMP MEETING WITH NEPAL\'S CHIEF OF ARMY </p><p>STAFF AND NATIONAL SECURITY SECRETARIAT C-TN2-00948 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI. REASONS: 1.5 (B and D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  In two separate meetings on October 22 2002, </p><p>Deputy Assistant Secretary for South Asia, Donald A. Camp, </p><p>accompanied by LTC James E Oxley IV, Defense Attache7 and </p><p>MAJ </p><p>Pete Fowler, Security Assistance Office, met with Royal </p><p>Nepalese </p><p>Army Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Pyar Jung Thapa and </p><p>Major General (MG) Rookmangud Katwal of the National Security </p><p>Council Secretariat.  COAS Thapa clamed that the army is </p><p>doing </p><p>well against the Maoists, whose numbers, he asserts, are </p><p>shrinking.  Lack of adequate financial support and </p><p>development </p><p>planning from the civilian government, Thapa said, have kept </p><p>the </p><p>Integrated Security and Development Program (ISDP) from </p><p>taking </p><p>root in Maoist affected districts.  The Indians have helped </p><p>in </p><p>turning over low-level Maoist cadres but have so far not </p><p>succeeded in capturing any of the leaders.  MG Katwal told </p><p>Camp that domestic political consensus is critical to </p><p>defeating the </p><p>Maoists, who are adept at exploiting the vacuum left by bad </p><p>governance and driving wedges between competing political </p><p>interests.  While Thapa appears correct that support for the </p><p>Maoists is dwindling, the race is on for who or what will </p><p>capture popular support. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In two separate meetings On October 22 2002, South </p><p>Asia </p><p>Deputy Assistant Secretary Donald A Camp met with Royal </p><p>Nepalese Army Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Pyar Jung </p><p>Thapa and MG Rookmangud Katwal of the National Security </p><p>Council </p><p>(NSC) Secretariat. </p><p> </p><p>Meeting with COAS Thapa </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Maoist Situation: General Thapa admitted that, while </p><p>the </p><p>Maoists may make some good ideological points, over time they </p><p>have proven they cannot deliver.  Asserting that the Maoists </p><p>do not take care of people, Thapa explained that they have </p><p>promised land, jobs and opportunities and brought nothing but </p><p>destruction. Maoists steal food from people, force induction </p><p>into their ranks, and destroy key infrastructure.  According </p><p>to </p><p>General Thapa, people are fed up.  During the first five </p><p>years </p><p>of the insurgency Maoists had some strength and, being the </p><p>clever </p><p>and adaptive people they are, chose to go against the police </p><p>who have a bad reputation of repression.  The Maoists found </p><p>some popular support because the people did not like the </p><p>police.  When the army entered the battle last November, the </p><p>Maoists told the people that the army was going to be just </p><p>like </p><p>the police.  While the army did suffer some initial setbacks, </p><p>to the Maoist\'s surprise the army now is doing well.  Maoist </p><p>numbers are shrinking.  Because of army action and a </p><p>corresponding loss of support by the people, Maoists are </p><p>forced </p><p>to attack soft targets.  This change is further alienating </p><p>the </p><p>Maoists from the people.  The Chief went on to say that the </p><p>Maoists are nothing like the North Vietnamese Army (NVA); it </p><p>was clear that the NVA avoided destroying key infrastructure </p><p>that would alienate the people. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) RNA Problems and Strengths: General Thapa thanked the </p><p>USG for assisting with M16A2 rifles and highlighted the </p><p>importance of the weapons.  The RNA\'s self-loading rifles </p><p>(SLR), provided over 30 years ago by India for free, served </p><p>the </p><p>army well, but today are worn out.  Thapa said that soldiers </p><p>have no confidence in the SLR, and said that the same weapons </p><p>are problems for the Maoists.  He illustrated that point by </p><p>telling of a captured video of a Maoist leader in an attack </p><p>on </p><p>an RNA position.  The video showed the leader trying to clear </p><p>multiple stoppages of several of his captured RNA weapons </p><p>before being shot by the defending RNA.  The army is also in </p><p>need of more defensive equipment like night vision goggles </p><p>and attack helicopters. Thapa indicated that another problem </p><p>is the </p><p>creation of rehabilitation programs.  For example, the RNA </p><p>has </p><p>tried to have NGOs assist with women the RNA has liberated, </p><p>but </p><p>has not received much help. </p><p> </p><p>On a more positive note, the COAS said that RNA intelligence </p><p>is getting much better.  The Maoists keep good diaries, which </p><p>have been captured after battles. More importantly, the RNA </p><p>is gaining momentum because the Nepalese people like to back </p><p>winners.  When the Maoists looked strong the people </p><p>gravitated to them.  Today, that has changed. On human </p><p>rights, the COAS believed that a few soldiers have committed </p><p>violations but that the RNA is taking the right steps to </p><p>bring justice and stop future violations (NFI). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Nepal\'s Political Situation: General Thapa assured DAS </p><p>Camp that Nepal continues to support the USG war on terrorism </p><p>as it did shortly after the 9/11 attacks.  He also reiterated </p><p>Nepalese appreciation of USG diplomatic support.  The COAS </p><p>said </p><p>that the King remains committed to the multiparty system and </p><p>would hold local elections first, before national elections. </p><p>(Note: He did not provide a timeline.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Should national elections take place first, the winning party </p><p>would </p><p>try to influence elections at the local level, something the </p><p>present government wants to avoid. </p><p> </p><p>General Thapa also highlighted the need for some local </p><p>representation at the grass roots level.  With the local </p><p>bodies dissolved, only administrators, drawn from outside the </p><p>local area, are running the local governments. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Nepal\'s Integrated Security and Development Program </p><p>(ISDP): General Thapa termed ISDP in Gorkha a success (Note: </p><p>Gorkha is the only area still implementing ISDP following the </p><p>imposition of the emergency in November 2002. End Note.), but </p><p>said there were several problems with resources and basic </p><p>good </p><p>governance that had to be improved in future ISDP programs. </p><p>The biggest problem has been not in the realm of security but </p><p>in that of development programming.  Development money in </p><p>sufficient </p><p>amounts never arrived in Gorkha from the central government. </p><p>Seventy irrigation projects were never completed, and </p><p>additional </p><p>road construction, critical to improving living standards for </p><p>the people, were not even started. </p><p> </p><p>Those that were started, were never completed.  General Thapa </p><p>replied that, despite the lack of resources, the Army has </p><p>used its resources and what little the government did provide </p><p>to restart uncompleted road and other projects.  Thapa said </p><p>that the Army has been able to do projects for less than half </p><p>the cost of the civilian administrators.  He was optimistic </p><p>that the new government </p><p>would remedy the situation but believed that, in the future, </p><p>the Army would be more involved in development.  DAS Camp </p><p>asked </p><p>what the potential strain on the army would be when it did </p><p>both </p><p>development and security. </p><p> </p><p>General Thapa said that the Army would continue to use its </p><p>civilian-oriented engineer capability but, for the most part, </p><p>would only organize the civilians who do the work.  When </p><p>asked about future ISDP locations, General Thapa said the </p><p>districts of Bardia, Ramechhap, Dang and around the city of </p><p>Trisuli. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ISDP Strategy re-look: The COAS believed that the ISDP </p><p>strategy might have to change from focusing on the worst </p><p>areas </p><p>that require a huge amount of resources to propping up the </p><p>weaker districts, in particular those districts around </p><p>Kathmandu.  For the worst affected areas in the west, the </p><p>Chief </p><p>said, building roads to the Maoist heartland was a priority. </p><p>General Thapa told of his suggestion that the government </p><p>create </p><p>a duty free zone in the Dang valley because of the valley\'s </p><p>importance in controlling access into Rolpa and Rukum </p><p>districts.  General Thapa also said that there was a need to </p><p>augment security forces and was considering the use of </p><p>village </p><p>defense forces.  When asked about how he sees such forces </p><p>working, the chief said that civilians would assist the </p><p>military with gaining better intelligence in order to use </p><p>army </p><p>forces more effectively.  On the issue of arming the defense </p><p>forces, the chief only said perhaps they could be armed with </p><p>shotguns. (Note:  Post has not seen any use of armed militias </p><p>supported by the government, and except for General Thapa\'s </p><p>comments, little evidence the army is willing to arm </p><p>civilians. </p><p>End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Indian Support for Solving the Insurgency: In response </p><p>to a question on India\'s role in assisting Nepal against the </p><p>insurgents, General Thapa said they have been helpful.  He </p><p>said </p><p>the Indians have turned over low-level leaders but also </p><p>complained that when Nepal asked the Indians to arrest the </p><p>top </p><p>leaders living in India, the Indians said they needed </p><p>specific </p><p>data on their whereabouts.  The Chief did note a change for </p><p>the </p><p>better in India\'s assistance after they realized that the </p><p>Nepalese Maoists were involved with India\'s antigovernment </p><p>organizations.  He also noted that the King had effectively </p><p>pressed for more Indian help during his last trip to India. </p><p>Today the Indians have mobilized their special security </p><p>police </p><p>to the India-Nepal border but, the chief said, the Indians </p><p>are </p><p>continually upset about what India claims is Nepalese support </p><p>for Pakistan\'s Inter-Service Intelligence Directorate. </p><p> </p><p>Meeting with General Katwal from Nepal\'s NSC </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Maoist\'s situation: MG Katwal said that the Royal </p><p>Nepalese Army (RNA) understands that there is a strong link </p><p>between human rights and keeping the support of the people </p><p>and </p><p>believes human rights abusers must be punished.  Katwal also </p><p>stressed the need for increased international assistance in </p><p>logistic support and mobility. (Note: MG Katwal has often </p><p>made </p><p>the point that the RNA needs a full range of military </p><p>assistance from tents to helicopters.)  He expressed </p><p>appreciation for USG military support and said that the </p><p>Nepalese Government needed help in rehabilitating and housing </p><p>former Maoists.  MG Katwal said that aid is an important </p><p>component of any solution to the Maoist problem, but </p><p>emphasized </p><p>that aid must reach the people now in order to be beneficial. </p><p>He also indicated that it would be beneficial if aid were </p><p>provided in such a way as to be recognized with the </p><p>Government </p><p>of Nepal in order to strengthen democracy. </p><p> </p><p>Indian Support for Solving the Insurgency </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Though he praised US diplomatic efforts towards India </p><p>to date, Katwal stressed the need for the USG to keep up the </p><p>pressure, stating that the US must make the Indians </p><p>understand that our intention is to help the GON bring the </p><p>Maoist situation under control. He said India believes the US </p><p>is trying to establish a </p><p>strategic foothold in Nepal.  Katwal cautioned that the </p><p>Indians </p><p>still want to guard their hegemony in the region. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Nepal\'s Political Situation: On Nepal\'s current </p><p>political situation, Katwal said that the new government must </p><p>formulate a national strategy on democracy and create </p><p>domestic </p><p>consensus against the Maoists.  The Maoists, who are quick to </p><p>adapt and seize opportunities, are exploiting the vacuum </p><p>created by bad governance.  They drive wedges between parties </p><p>and always go after whatever party is in power.  The parties </p><p>not in power, because of their own selfish ambition to be in </p><p>charge, fail to support the government, which assists the </p><p>Maoists.  Today the Maoists are attempting to pull the </p><p>political parties together against the King, who is the only </p><p>unifying force in the country.  Parties are threatening to </p><p>join </p><p>with the Maoists, which in the worst case will lead to the </p><p>monarchy fighting the Maoists.  Katwal said the government </p><p>will </p><p>have to negotiate with the Maoists but that should be from a </p><p>position of strength.  Katwal made the point that Nepal\'s </p><p>democracy needs time to mature but worried that by the time </p><p>democracy matures, the Maoists will be on top. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) While many points covered by both the COAS and MG </p><p>Katwal have been heard in the past, what is different now is </p><p>that we are hearing some of the same arguments by the King </p><p>and </p><p>his appointed government.  General Thapa is correct that the </p><p>Maoists have not delivered; what is also true is that the </p><p>government too has not delivered.  It appears that many </p><p>people </p><p>in the countryside are fed up with both the Maoists and the </p><p>government.  This being said, the race is on for who or what </p><p>will capture their support.  It is still too early to tell if </p><p>the King can act as the catalyst to stem the rot of bad </p><p>governance and bring real reforms at the grass roots in order </p><p>to make Nepal\'s democracy prosper. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) DAS Camp has cleared this report. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
