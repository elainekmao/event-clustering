(U) UN OCHA hosted an NGO/IO coordination meeting on 2 </p><p>April at UN House in Ankara.  UN OCHA, UNHCR, UNDP, UNJLC, </p><p>IFRC, the American Red Cross, nine NGOs and DART Field </p><p>Office/North attended.  The UN reported that food and </p><p>non-food items transited the Turkish-Iraqi border on 29 March </p><p>and 1 April, and that additional food items are scheduled for </p><p>delivery to northern Iraq the week of 6 April.  NGOs report </p><p>no progress on their registration with the Turkish government </p><p>(GOT) to either provide humanitarian assistance in Turkey or </p><p>transit through to provide assistance in northern Iraq.  NGOs </p><p>continue to look at other options for entering Iraq.  UN </p><p>reports that local staff in northern Iraq have begun some </p><p>assessment work, and UNSECOORD is prepared to begin a </p><p>security assessment there when clearances are given. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>UN Update </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) UN reported that on 31 March three WFP trucks carrying </p><p>wheat, soy and milk powder (WSM) transited into northern </p><p>Iraq.  On 1 April two UNICEF trucks carrying HTH Chloride and </p><p>medical kits transited.  Both shipments went to UN warehouses </p><p>in Dohuk.  WFP currently has 70 additional truckloads of </p><p>wheat flour scheduled for delivery the week of 6 April.  The </p><p>flour will be transported to Dohuk, and eventually on to </p><p>Arbil and Sulaimaniyah. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) UN Operational Support Center for Turkey has a staff </p><p>member assigned to the GOT Crisis Center in Diyarbakir.  UN </p><p>reports that MFA is requesting one-week notice for its staff </p><p>wishing to travel to southeastern Turkey. UN also noted that </p><p>no travel is allowed beyond Diyarbakir without proper </p><p>registration with the GOT.  The border is closed to </p><p>journalists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) UN reports that it has contacted the GOT to discuss a </p><p>humanitarian corridor into northern Iraq.  At the same time, </p><p>they continue to investigate the possibility of using a </p><p>Syrian corridor to move humanitarian supplies into Iraq. </p><p>Transit and port fees in Syria remain an issue. </p><p>---------- </p><p>NGO Issues </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) ID cards and who issues them remain concerns for NGOs </p><p>planning to work in northern Iraq.  DART reported that the </p><p>issues are also being discussed in Amman and Kuwait.  NGOs </p><p>currently in Turkey are in favor of using their own </p><p>organizations, ID cards, and not those issued by the U.S. </p><p>military. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) NGOs report no progress in the GOT registration </p><p>process.  One NGO representative has left Turkey and will </p><p>monitor the process from elsewhere in the region.  Another </p><p>NGO representative is scheduled to leave on 5 April, and yet </p><p>another has been instructed by headquarters to leave the week </p><p>of 6 April if no progress is reported.  UN reported that the </p><p>MFA and other GOT offices might meet to discuss the NGO </p><p>registration process.  (Note: In a trilateral meeting between </p><p>GOT, UN and USG on 3 April, MFA reported that permits to </p><p>transit Turkey to work in northern Iraq will soon be granted </p><p>to at least some of the NGOs that had filed applications to </p><p>do so.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) An NGO looking at the possibility of using the </p><p>Syrian corridor for entering northern Iraq was informed by </p><p>contacts in Damascus that the corridor is closed to all </p><p>except those who previously received permission to travel </p><p>this route.  NGOs continue to investigate this avenue, </p><p>however, as they receive conflicting information from </p><p>contacts in northern Iraq.  Iran remains a possible entry </p><p>point for some.  DART reported that Air Serv International, </p><p>currently contracted to provide air transport services to </p><p>USAID/OFDA, may be a better alternative for entering northern </p><p>Iraq if transiting Turkey is not allowed.  U.S. military </p><p>transport was also mentioned as a possibility. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) UN informed NGOs that those wishing to partner with UN </p><p>agencies in northern Iraq should contact the UN information </p><p>management officer in Larnaca, Mr. Giorgio Saroti, for </p><p>information on which UN agency would be appropriate for the </p><p>NGO.  UN currently has sector working groups in northern Iraq </p><p>that collaborate with local committees that review NGOs </p><p>seeking to provide assistance in their area.  NGOs approved </p><p>are then required to register with local authorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Northern Iraq Update </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) UNSECOORD is awaiting clearances from Larnaca and </p><p>Ankara (to transit) to conduct a security assessment of the </p><p>Kurdish-controlled region of Iraq.  Two four-person teams are </p><p>prepared to begin the assessment in Dohuk when clearances are </p><p>received. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) UNICEF local staff in northern Iraq have begun </p><p>assessments on the IDP and water/sanitation issues in the </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) UN OCHA reports that fuel is being imported into </p><p>northern Iraq from Iran.  Supplies have improved, but prices </p><p>remain high. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Future Meetings </p><p>--------------- </p><p>12. (U) The next NGO/IO coordination meeting will be held at </p><p>UNHCR on 9 April at 1400 hrs.  DART will attend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
