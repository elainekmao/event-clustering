<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001989 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR C. NOVELLI </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR J. BUNTIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIPR, ETRD, KU, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: IPR LETTER TO KUWAITI CROWN PRINCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 01911 </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 123166 </p><p> </p><p>This is an action request for the office of the US Trade </p><p>Representative (USTR).  See para 1. </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.  Post plans to use the release </p><p>of the Special 301 report to make a new push for intellectual </p><p>property rights (IPR) reform in Kuwait later this month (Ref </p><p>A).  Per email exchanges to USTR, post requests a letter from </p><p>US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick to Kuwaiti Crown </p><p>Prince Shaykh Saad Al-Abdallah Al-Sabah, which incorporates </p><p>talking points aimed at improving Kuwait\'s IPR protection and </p><p>enforcement efforts in the coming year (Ref B).  A draft text </p><p>of the letter is contained in para 2.  Post hopes to receive </p><p>a response to this draft at USTR\'s earliest convenience.  In </p><p>addition to delivering this letter to the Crown Prince, the </p><p>Ambassador plans to use the letter as a starting point for </p><p>discussions during upcoming meetings with other key GOK </p><p>officials.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>2. Text of the letter: </p><p> </p><p>Your Highness: </p><p> </p><p>I first wish to extend my government\'s deep appreciation for </p><p>the indispensable assistance Kuwait has provided throughout </p><p>the liberation of Iraq.  Your government\'s cooperation and </p><p>commitment to this effort has been truly commendable. </p><p> </p><p>I would now like to turn your attention to another matter of </p><p>mutual concern.  On May 1, I made a worldwide announcement of </p><p>the results of the 2003 "Special 301" annual review.  This </p><p>report examines in detail the adequacy and effectiveness of </p><p>the efforts made by our international trading partners to </p><p>protect intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, </p><p>copyrights and patents. </p><p> </p><p>As you may know, Kuwait was again place on the Watch List, as </p><p>a country of particular concern for insufficient protection </p><p>of intellectual property.  Copyright violations continue to </p><p>pose the most serious problem in Kuwait, where the rate of </p><p>piracy remains the highest in the Gulf region.  According to </p><p>industry estimates, 95 percent of motion pictures and 64 </p><p>percent of records and music sold in Kuwait are illegally </p><p>pirated copies. </p><p> </p><p>These figures have grown so far out of any reasonable </p><p>proportion that they are tarnishing Kuwait\'s image to </p><p>international investors.  Companies such as Microsoft, AOL </p><p>Time Warner and Disney have been placing the center of their </p><p>Middle East operations in the United Arab Emirates, rather </p><p>than Kuwait, resulting in large losses of revenue now and in </p><p>the future for your country.  As a prime example, Showtime </p><p>recently signed a 10-year deal worth millions of dollars with </p><p>the Dubai Investment Authority. </p><p> </p><p>This problem also threatens to create unnecessary strains in </p><p>our bilateral relations.  Last year alone the motion picture </p><p>industry estimated that it lost approximately USD 10 million </p><p>in Kuwait, while the music industry lost an additional USD </p><p>3.4 million from sales of illegally sold products.  As the </p><p>majority of those films and records are owned by American </p><p>production companies or created by American artists, Kuwaiti </p><p>vendors of pirated goods are in essence stealing U.S. </p><p>property. </p><p> </p><p>The purpose of the Special 301 report is not to condemn but </p><p>rather to highlight and resolve problems.  The U.S. </p><p>Government would like nothing better than to see Kuwait </p><p>removed from the Watch List.  Toward this end, we stand ready </p><p>to assist you in meeting your international obligations and </p><p>are willing to explore opportunities for potential technical </p><p>assistance and expert training on improving IPR enforcement </p><p>and protection. </p><p> </p><p>We must, however, see Kuwait begin to intensify the depth and </p><p>breadth of its efforts.  Steps that need to be taken as soon </p><p>as possible include the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Making a public declaration at the highest level that </p><p>copyright piracy in Kuwait will not be tolerated. </p><p> </p><p>-- Introducing and passing the long-promised amendments </p><p>necessary to make copyright law fully consistent with the </p><p>provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO) TRIPs </p><p>Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>-- Undertaking a far more stringent and effective </p><p>intellectual property enforcement campaign, including </p><p>launching serious investigations of large-scale producers and </p><p>distributors of illegal goods, increasing penalties for </p><p>offenders, and publicizing results of the court cases as a </p><p>deterrent to future crimes. </p><p>To be effective, the police force must be incorporated into </p><p>this process, making regular arrests of all violators.  These </p><p>include the young street vendors, who sell pirated copies of </p><p>CDs and DVDs throughout Kuwait, to the high-level importers </p><p>and manufacturers of illegal goods.  Experience has shown in </p><p>countries like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, </p><p>where copyright piracy once posed rampant problems, that </p><p>great strides can be made once the police are directed to </p><p>take proper action. </p><p> </p><p>In today\'s information and technology based global economy, </p><p>intellectual property rights industries have become the </p><p>growth industry of the 21st Century.  Those countries that do </p><p>not actively pursue and protect these intellectual property </p><p>rights and associated companies are essentially closing the </p><p>door on a wealth of economic potential. </p><p> </p><p>In the interest of both of our countries, we would like to </p><p>renew our cooperation with you on this important front and </p><p>see that Kuwait joins the list of countries well respected </p><p>for its protection of intellectual property rights. </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p> </p><p>Robert B. Zoellick </p><p>U.S. Trade Representative </p><p>URBANCIC </p><p></p></div>
