<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 005418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/FO AND NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, SOCI, KU </p><p>SUBJECT:  SADDAM\'S SPEECH RALLIES KUWAITIS AGAINST HIM </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein\'s December 7 </p><p>speech to "the sons of the People in Kuwait" has inspired </p><p>Kuwaitis to rally around their leadership and reaffirm their </p><p>gratitude for the U.S. military presence, by reminding them </p><p>of the existential threat he poses to their country.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. Saddam\'s address to "the sons of the people in Kuwait," </p><p>read on Iraqi television December 7, was billed as an </p><p>apology but was in fact filled with insults, threats, and </p><p>incitement.  To the extent that it was aimed at Kuwaitis, it </p><p>has backfired, reminding the Kuwaitis of his pronouncements </p><p>leading up to the Iraqi invasion in 1990. This has prompted </p><p>the Kuwaiti people to rally around their leadership and </p><p>reaffirm support for the American military presence in </p><p>Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>3. In a special session held December 14, members of the </p><p>Kuwaiti National Assembly from all political currents </p><p>categorically rejected the speech and its attempts to drive </p><p>wedges between Kuwait\'s people and leadership, and between </p><p>the Kuwaitis and the U.S.  Many speakers noted that the </p><p>speech was a flagrant violation of the Security Council </p><p>resolutions and of Beirut Arab Summit.  The following </p><p>remarks were typical of the session: </p><p> </p><p>MP Ahmad Al-Saadoun (independent frequently at odds with the </p><p>Government): "whoever says that there is a popular rejection </p><p>of the American presence is lying." </p><p> </p><p>MP Fahd Al-Hajiri (pro-government): "We, as representatives </p><p>of the Kuwaiti people, support the presence of the friendly </p><p>troops on our land and we proudly open our hearts for them </p><p>and they are dear guests." </p><p> </p><p>MP Mezyid Al-Deehani (pro-government): "Foreign troops in </p><p>Kuwait came to protect our borders in the framework of </p><p>security agreements. Let Saddam know that the American </p><p>presence is welcomed by the Kuwaiti people." </p><p> </p><p>MP Meshari Al-Osaimi (liberal): "Saddam\'s speech is inciting </p><p>the people against their leadership and the allying troops." </p><p> </p><p>MP Khamis Iqab (independent): "I request the government to </p><p>take care of the security agreements. We are not colonized </p><p>and the American presence came as per agreements and </p><p>treaties and as per our request." </p><p> </p><p>MP Mubarak Al-Duwaila (Islamist): "The foreign presence in </p><p>Kuwait came to protect Kuwait after the sisterly states </p><p>proved to be unable to help protect the sisterly country </p><p>from another sisterly country. It came with the approval of </p><p>the entire people." </p><p> </p><p>MP Eid Hathal (pro-government): "We hold the foreign </p><p>presence in high esteem and respect; without it Kuwait would </p><p>have been wiped out at the hands of Saddam and his clique." </p><p> </p><p>MP Mubarak Snaidih (Islamist): "We affirm our keenness to </p><p>protect the American and friendly troops in Kuwait and we </p><p>have to provide them with what they want." </p><p> </p><p>MP Mohammed Al-Khalifa (pro-government): "Foreign troops are </p><p>present in Kuwait as per the will of the Kuwaiti people and </p><p>we welcome them." </p><p> </p><p>MP Abdul Wahab Al-Haroun (liberal): "If there have been </p><p>individual operations (against the foreign troops) this does </p><p>not mean that they express the feelings of the "Kuwaiti </p><p>Street" nor that of the Islamic currents which have openly </p><p>expressed their opinion in today\'s session." </p><p> </p><p>MP Abdul Aziz Al-Mutawa (independent): "The Iraqi regime </p><p>should know it is we who have invited the foreign troops to </p><p>Kuwait within the framework of agreements and treaties to </p><p>protect Kuwait." </p><p> </p><p>4.  At the beginning of the session, the First Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister/Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmad delivered </p><p>the government\'s statement in which he said:  "The foreign </p><p>troops did not enter Kuwait as invading or occupying troops </p><p>but rather as the troops of allied countries which are </p><p>present in Kuwait - and welcomed by the Kuwaitis - pursuant </p><p>to agreements and conventions concluded between the </p><p>government of the State of Kuwait and the governments of </p><p>their countries, ratified by the National Assembly. Thanks </p><p>to these troops, after God Almighty and with the involvement </p><p>of sisterly states, for the liberation of Kuwait from the </p><p>heinous barbaric occupation. We hold on to these agreements </p><p>and the necessity of activating them as the Iraqi regime is </p><p>still threatening aggression, expansion and violation of </p><p>sanctities." </p><p> </p><p>5.  Kuwaiti NGOs and unions held a rally the evening of </p><p>December 14 to express their categorical rejection of the </p><p>speech and their support to their legitimate leadership. </p><p>Poloff and Pol FSN represented the Embassy on short notice </p><p>and were given special importance and a warm welcome.  The </p><p>Chairman of the Kuwait Bar Association, who was one of the </p><p>speakers at the rally, switched to English to express thanks </p><p>to the American troops who led the coalition in the </p><p>liberation of Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
