(S) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST: LIBYAN FM SHALGAM WILL </p><p>MEET PM BERLUSCONI AND FM FRATTINI IN ROME FEB. 5.  THE GOI </p><p>PROMISED TO DISCOURAGE A LIBYAN UNSC CANDIDACY.  ITALIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS ARE CONSIDERING HOW TO RESPOND TO AN OFFER BY </p><p>QADAFFI TO PRESS FOR IRAQI COMPLIANCE ON WMD.  IF DEPARTMENT </p><p>HAS ANY POINTS THAT IT WOULD LIKE THE MFA TO CONVEY TO THE </p><p>LIBYAN FM ON IRAQ, PLEASE SEND TO EMBASSY BY OOB FEB. 5, ROME </p><p>TIME. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) ON FEB. 4, AMBASSADOR, A/DCM, AND POL MC MET WITH AMB. </p><p>GIANNI CASTELLANETA, PM BERLUSCONI\'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR. </p><p>AMBASSADOR INQUIRED ABOUT PRESS REPORTS STATING THAT </p><p>BERLUSCONI RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM QADAFFI.  CASTELLANETA </p><p>REPLIED THAT QADAFFI CALLED BERLUSCONI ON JAN. 31, </p><p>IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE PM\'S RETURN FROM WASHINGTON, TO ASK </p><p>ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A MILITARY INTERVENTION IN IRAQ.  THE </p><p>PM RESPONDED THAT THE IRAQI SITUATION WAS A VERY SERIOUS ONE. </p><p> QADAFFI SAID THAT LIBYA IS WILLING TO USE ANY INFLUENCE IT </p><p>MAY HAVE TO GET IRAQ TO COMPLY TO UNSC AND DISARM. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) CASTELLANETA SAID THAT LIBYAN FM, ABDEL RAHMAN </p><p>SHALGAM, WILL BE IN ROME FEB. 5 TO MEET WITH THE PM AND THE </p><p>FM, AND ASKED IF THE GOI SHOULD PURSUE WITH THE LIBYAN FM </p><p>QADAFFI\'S OFFER TO MEDIATE WITH IRAQ.  AMBASSADOR AND POL MC </p><p>REPLIED THAT THE USG IS SEEKING INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON </p><p>SADDAM TO COMPLY WITH UNSC 1441 AND DISARM, BUT DOUBTED THAT </p><p>LIBYA HAD ANY SPECIAL INFLUENCE ON IRAQ.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>AMBASSADOR PROMISED TO PASS QADAFFI\'S OFFER TO THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT.  THE MORE URGENT MESSAGE THE USG WOULD WANT ITALY </p><p>TO RAISE WITH SHALGAM IS TO PRESS LIBYA TO WITHDRAW ITS </p><p>CANDIDACY FOR THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) LATER FEB. 4, CESARE RAGAGLINI, THE FM\'S CHIEF OF </p><p>STAFF, CALLED POL MC WITH THE SAME QUESTION RAISED BY </p><p>CASTELLANETA.  POL MC REPEATED THE SAME POINTS TO RAGAGLINI, </p><p>EMPHASIZING THE HIGHER PRIORITY OF LIBYA\'S UNSC SEAT ISSUE </p><p>AND ITALY\'S UNIQUE STANDING WITH TRIPOLI.  RAGAGLINI SAID </p><p>THAT FM FRATTINI HAD ALREADY DISCUSSED THE ISSUE ON THE PHONE </p><p>WITH SHALGAM WHO WAS HOPEFUL THAT THE LOCKERBIE ISSUE WOULD </p><p>BE SOLVED THIS YEAR IN TIME SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE AN </p><p>OBSTACLE TO A LIBYAN CANDIDACY TO THE UNSC.  POL MC EXPRESSED </p><p>HIS SKEPTICISM, AND RAGAGLINI AGREED THAT THE MFA IS NOT </p><p>COUNTING ON THE LOCKERBIE ISSUE BEING SOLVED THIS YEAR.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT FRATTINI WAS GOING TO BE CLEAR IN HIS "FRIENDLY </p><p>ADVICE" TO SHALGAM: IT IS STRONGLY ADVISABLE FOR LIBYA TO </p><p>POSTPONE ITS CANDIDACY FOR THE UNSC, REGARDLESS OF ITS </p><p>EXPECTATIONS ON RESOLVING THE LOCKERBIE CASE THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003ROME00443 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
