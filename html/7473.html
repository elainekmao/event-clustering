<p>S E C R E T ROME 001625 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, EU, IT, LY, PREL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN REQUEST FOR EU EXCEPTION TO LIBYA ARMS </p><p>EMBARGO </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEKACH-KILNER EMAIL 4/11/03 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p> (B) (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) ON THE BASIS OF REF EMAIL, ECMIN RAISED RECENT </p><p>REPORTS THAT THE GOI HAD ASKED THE EU TO RELAX THE ARMS </p><p>EMBARGO AGAINST LIBYA DURING AN APRIL 11 MEETING WITH MFA </p><p>DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR THE MIDDLE EAST ANTONIO BADINI. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BADINI CONFIRMED THAT THIS WAS CORRECT, EXPLAINING </p><p>THAT A FEW WEEKS AGO THE GOI HAD INITIATED AN EFFORT TO GAIN </p><p>EU AGREEMENT TO REVIEW THE ARMS EMBARGO LIST.  IF THIS </p><p>AGREEMENT WERE OBTAINED, BADINI SAID THE GOI\'S OBJECTIVE </p><p>WOULD BE TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN ITEMS FROM THE "OUTDATED" </p><p>EMBARGO LIST, SUCH AS PATROL BOATS, WHICH "ARE CLEARLY NOT </p><p>EVEN DUAL USE."  HE FURTHER CONFIRMED THAT WHAT IS DRIVING </p><p>ITALIAN ACTIONS IS A STRONG DESIRE TO HELP LIBYA PATROL ITS </p><p>COASTLINE MORE EFFECTIVELY TO STEM THE FLOW OF ILLEGAL </p><p>IMMIGRANTS FROM AFRICA.  THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM, HE </p><p>STRESSED, IS AN "IMMEDIATE THREAT" WHICH THE GOI NEEDS TO </p><p>ADDRESS URGENTLY.  BADINI ESTIMATED THAT A FINAL EU DECISION </p><p>ON THE ITALIAN REQUEST WOULD TAKE 3-4 MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>3.(S) ECMIN REPLIED THAT, WHILE THE U.S. UNDERSTOOD THE </p><p>SEVERITY OF ITALY\'S ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION PROBLEM, WE STRONGLY </p><p>OPPOSED ANY RELAXATION OF THE ARMS EMBARGO UNTIL LIBYA HAD </p><p>DEMONSTRATED COMPLETE ABANDONMENT OF TERRORISM.  ECMIN </p><p>FURTHER TOOK STRONG EXCEPTION TO BADINI\'S CHARACTERIZATION OF </p><p>PATROL BOATS AS "NOT DUAL USE," REMINDING THE DG THAT </p><p>    SECRETARY POWELL FELT SO STRONGLY ABOUT THE RECENT CASE OF </p><p>ITALIAN FAST BOATS FOR IRAN THAT HE HAD RAISED THE ISSUE </p><p>DIRECTLY WITH FM FRATTINI.  THE SECRETARY HAS BEEN </p><p>APPRECIATIVE OF ITALIAN ACTIONS TO STOP THAT DELIVERY, EVEN </p><p>WRITING FRATTINI TO THANK HIM.  IT WOULD BE A SERIOUS MISTAKE </p><p>TO HAVE TO RETRACE THE SAME PATH AGAIN WITH RESPECT TO LIBYA. </p><p> FINALLY, ECMIN NOTED PRESS REPORTS THAT VERY DAY OF IRANIAN </p><p>PATROL BOATS HARASSING U.S. WARSHIPS IN THE PERSIAN GULF. </p><p> </p><p>4.(S) BADINI ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE IRAN </p><p>FAST-BOATS CASE, BUT TRIED TO ARGUE THAT "LIBYA IS NOT IRAN." </p><p> HE MAINTAINED THAT LIBYA HAD TAKEN "VERY LARGE, IMPORTANT </p><p>STEPS TO FIGHT TERRORISM."  BADINI ADDED THAT HE AND OTHERS </p><p>WOULD BE GLAD TO SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS "ANY EVIDENCE YOU HAVE </p><p>TO THE CONTRARY."  IF THE EU APPROVED THE REVIEW OF THE </p><p>EMBARGO LIST, THE GOI WOULD ALSO BE WILLING TO CONSULT WITH </p><p>THE U.S. ON TECHNICAL CONCERNS ABOUT PROPOSED DELETIONS FROM </p><p>THE LIST. ECMIN REITERATED THAT THE U.S. DID NOT SHARE </p><p>ITALY\'S ANALYSIS, AND THAT WE WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY WISH TO </p><p>DISCUSS FURTHER THE GOI\'S EFFORT TO REVIEW THE LIBYA ARMS </p><p>EMBARGO. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ON APRIL 15 ECONOFFS RAISED THE PROPOSED EXPORT TO </p><p>LIBYA WITH GIANPAOLO SCARANTE, DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO </p><p>PM BERLUSCONI.  SCARANTE TOLD US THAT BADINI ALREADY HAD </p><p>RELAYED TO HIM U.S. CONCERNS, AND HAD ALSO TOLD HIM THAT THE </p><p>GOI DID NOT EXPECT TO RECEIVE EU SUPPORT FOR THE GOI </p><p>PROPOSAL. (NOTE - IN THE PROVISIONAL READOUT OF THE APRIL 14 </p><p>GAERC MEETING, FORWARDED TO US BY USEU, THE COUNCIL CALLED </p><p>FOR THE CREATION OF A WORKING GROUP ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION </p><p>"TO EXAMINE THE SITUATION SO AS TO ENABLE THE COUNCIL TO </p><p>    EVALUATE HOW THE EU MIGHT COOPERATE SO AS TO ENHANCE LIBYA\'S </p><p>CAPACITY TO FIGHT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION." THERE IS NO MENTION </p><p>OF THE EU LOOSENING ITS ARMS EMBARGO, WHICH IT EXPLICITLY </p><p>STATES "REMAINS IN PLACE.") </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ACTING ECMIN AND ECONOFF FURTHER RAISED OUR CONCERNS </p><p>APRIL 15 WITH NEWLY ARRIVED MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR ECONOMIC </p><p>COOPERATION GIANDOMENICO MAGLIANO. WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>ITALY\'S NEED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, </p><p>WE WISHED TO MAKE THE GOI AWARE OF OUR OPPOSITION TO THE </p><p>EXPORT OF ANY ITEMS WHICH COULD SUPPORT LIBYAN TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITY. THOUGH APPARENTLY UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUE, HE DID </p><p>NOTE PM BERLUSCONI\'S PLEDGE TO THE LIBYANS DURING A VISIT IN </p><p>OCTOBER 2002 TO EXAMINE COOPERATION TO FIGHT ILLEGAL </p><p>IMMIGRATION.  (AFTER A MEETING BETWEEN FM FRANCO FRATTINI AND </p><p>LIBYAN FM ABD AL-RAHMAN MOHAMMAD SHALGAM IN FEBRUARY 2003, </p><p>THE MFA ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT SAYS, IN PART, "ITALY IS </p><p>SEEKING ALSO TO INVOLVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IN SUPPORT OF </p><p>LIBYA\'S PROGRAM DESIGNED TO COMBAT" ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.)  WE </p><p>TOLD MAGLIANO THAT THE U.S. WOULD CONTINUE TO OPPOSE ANY </p><p>FURTHER EFFORTS TO LOOSEN THE EU ARMS EMBARGO AGAINST LIBYA. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01625 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
