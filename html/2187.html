REASONS: </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03400  01 OF 03  141547Z </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BLAMED THE MURDER OF A SENIOR WAR </p><p>VETERAN IN BULAWAYO ON THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) </p><p>AND HAS MOVED TO ARREST A NUMBER OF PARTY OFFICIALS.  MDC </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE REJECTED THE ALLEGATIONS AS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>"UTTER RUBBISH," WHILE MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI EXPRESSED </p><p>SYMPATHY TO THE WAR VETERAN\'S FAMILY AND URGED THE POLICE TO </p><p>ARREST THE REAL PERPETRATORS.  MDC MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT DAVID </p><p>COLTART IS CONVINCED THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO FRAME HIM FOR THE </p><p>MURDER, FEARS THAT HIS LIFE IS IN DANGER, AND ASKED THE USG TO </p><p>TELL THE GOZ THAT WE WILL HOLD IT RESPONSIBLE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS </p><p>TO COLTART OR OTHER MDC OFFICIALS.  (WE ARE MAKING THIS POINT TO </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT TODAY.)  WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC AND WIDESPREAD ARRESTS OF MDC OFFICIALS </p><p>COULD SPARK UNREST IN BULAWAYO.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE BODY OF CAIN NKALA, CHAIRMAN OF THE BULAWAYO WAR </p><p>VETERANS ASSOCIATION, WAS FOUND IN A SHALLOW GRAVE 40 KM SOUTHWEST </p><p>OF BULAWAYO ON NOVEMBER 13.  NKALA HAD BEEN ABDUCTED FROM HIS HOME </p><p>ON NOVEMBER 5 BY TEN MEN REPORTEDLY ARMED WITH AK-47\'S AFTER A </p><p>STRUGGLE IN WHICH HE AND HIS WIFE WERE INJURED.  AT THE TIME OF </p><p>HIS ABDUCTION, NKALA WAS FACING CHARGES IN THE JUNE 2000 </p><p>DISAPPEARANCE OF PATRICK NABANYAMA, THE POLLING AGENT FOR MDC </p><p>MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT DAVID COLTART, WHOSE BODY HAS NEVER BEEN </p><p>FOUND.  COLTART TOLD US, HOWEVER, THAT NKALA SEEMED TO HAVE </p><p>EXPERIENCED A CHANGE OF HEART IN RECENT WEEKS, AS HE WAS ASSISTING </p><p>WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS IN MEDIATING DISPUTES ON THEIR PROPERTIES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03400  01 OF 03  141547Z </p><p>AND MAY HAVE REVEALED TO A JOURNALIST THE WHEREABOUTS OF </p><p>NABANYAMA\'S BODY. </p><p> </p><p>OMINOUS GOVERNMENT RHETORIC </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE WEEK-AND-A-HALF BETWEEN NKALA\'S ABDUCTION AND THE </p><p>DISCOVERY OF HIS BODY WAS MARKED BY OMINOUS STATEMENTS FROM </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  IN INFLAMMATORY REMARKS ON A NATIONAL NEWS </p><p>BROADCAST ON NOVEMBER 13, MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS JOHN NKOMO </p><p>BLAMED THE MDC\'S LEADERSHIP FOR THE MURDER.  PRIOR TO THE </p><p>DISCOVERY OF THE BODY, HARARE WAR VETERAN LEADER JOSEPH CHINOTIMBA </p><p>CALLED THE ABDUCTION A "DECLARATION OF WAR."  VICE-PRESIDENT MSIKA </p><p>THREATENED VIOLENCE AGAINST THOSE RESPONSIBLE, VOWING THAT "IF </p><p>THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A BLOODBATH THEY WILL CERTAINLY GET IT." </p><p>OBERT MPOFU, GOVERNOR OF MATABELELAND NORTH PROVINCE, IN WHICH </p><p>BULAWAYO IS LOCATED, BLAMED A "THIRD FORCE" OF FORMER RHODESIAN </p><p>TROOPS, WHICH HE SAID WAS WORKING TO DESTABILIZE THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>A SENIOR ZANU-PF PROVINCIAL OFFICIAL URGED THAT WAR VETERANS BE </p><p>ARMED SO THAT THEY COULD PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST FURTHER </p><p>ABDUCTIONS.   SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE ZIMBABWE NATIONAL WAR </p><p>VETERANS ASSOCIATION ANDY MHLANGA CLAIMED THAT NKALA WAS KIDNAPPED </p><p>BY MDC SUPPORTERS AND SAID, SINCE WAR VETERANS ARE "GOOD" AT WAR, </p><p>THE OPPOSITION PARTY "SHOULD NOT BLAME US FOR WHAT HAPPENS NEXT." </p><p> </p><p>CRACKDOWN ON MDC </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE THREATENING STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>WIDESPREAD ARRESTS OF MDC OFFICIALS, POLICE RAIDS OF THE PARTY\'S </p><p>OFFICES IN HARARE AND BULAWAYO AND OF THE HOUSES OF MDC LEADERS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03400  01 OF 03  141547Z </p><p>AND VIOLENT ANTI-MDC DEMONSTRATIONS BY WAR VETERANS.  TWO DAYS </p><p>AFTER NKALA\'S ABDUCTION, MORE THAN 75 HEAVILY-ARMED POLICE SPENT </p><p>SEVERAL HOURS COMBING THE MDC\'S HEADQUARTERS IN BULAWAYO IN WHAT </p><p>THEY SAID WAS A SEARCH FOR NKALA.  ON NOVEMBER 10, A GROUP OF 100 </p><p>WAR VETERANS TRIED TO GAIN ENTRY TO THE MDC\'S HARARE HEADQUARTERS. </p><p>PREVENTED FROM DOING SO, THEY SPENT AN HOUR OUTSIDE ASSAULTING </p><p>PEOPLE ENTERING AND LEAVING THE BUILDING, AND DAMAGING THE VEHICLE </p><p>OF THE PARTY\'S NATIONAL SPOKESMAN LEARNMORE JONGWE.  SIX POLICE </p><p>OFFICERS WHO WERE STATIONED OUTSIDE THE BUILDING, ACCORDING TO A </p><p>SENIOR MDC OFFICIAL, DID NOTHING TO CONTROL THE CROWD UNTIL IT </p><p>DISPERSED ON ITS OWN.  ON NOVEMBER 12, POLICE ATTEMPTED TO SEARCH </p><p>THE HARARE OFFICES OF SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE AND </p><p>NATIONAL COORDINATOR ISAAC MAPOSA, BUT THEY LEFT WHEN NCUBE, A </p><p>PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, INSISTED THAT THEY PRODUCE A </p><p>SEARCH WARRANT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ACCORDING TO MDC INFORMATION OFFICER NKANYISO MAQEVA, AT </p><p>LEAST TEN MDC OFFICIALS OF VARYING RANKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE </p><p>BEEN ARRESTED DURING THE PAST WEEK.  IT IS DIFFICULT, MAQEVA SAID, </p><p>TO GET DETAILS ON ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, AS POLICE ARE </p><p>REFUSING TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION AND, IN MOST CASES, HAVE </p><p>BLOCKED ACCESS TO LEGAL COUNSEL.  THE POLICE SEEM TO BE TARGETTING </p><p>MDC LEADERS IN BULAWAYO, ALTHOUGH TWO PARTY OFFICIALS FROM THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5453 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03400  02 OF 03  141547Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------3E225A  141547Z /02 </p><p>O 141455Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0274 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 003400 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 11/14/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: WAR VETERAN MURDER SPARKS GOZ CRACKDOWN ON MDC AND UNREST </p><p>IN BULAWAYO </p><p> </p><p>HARARE AREA WERE ARRESTED EARLY IN THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 14 -- A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03400  02 OF 03  141547Z </p><p>DISTRICT SECRETARY FROM THE NEARBY TOWN OF CHITUNGWIZA AND A YOUTH </p><p>LEADER FROM THE HIGH-DENSITY SUBURB OF ST. MARY\'S.  NOMA </p><p>NABANYAMA, THE DAUGHTER OF PATRICK, WAS REPORTEDLY DETAINED ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 12 AND HELD OVERNIGHT BY POLICE, WHO SEIZED HER PASSPORT </p><p>AND ACCUSED HER OF LYING ABOUT HER FATHER\'S DISAPPEARANCE.  IN THE </p><p>LAST TWO DAYS, THE HOUSES OF MDC NATIONAL TREASURER, FLETCHER </p><p>DULINI, AND THE PARTY\'S BULAWAYO ADMINSTRATOR, ZWELITHINI </p><p>MSIMANGA, WERE SEARCHED WITHOUT WARRANTS. </p><p> </p><p>MDC REACTION </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE REJECTED ALLEGATIONS THAT </p><p>THE MDC WAS BEHIND NKALA\'S MURDER AS "UTTER RUBBISH."  IN A </p><p>CONVERSATION WITH US, HE SAID THE PARTY\'S ENTIRE PROVINCIAL </p><p>EXECUTIVE IN BULAWAYO HAS GONE INTO HIDING, AS HAVE TWO MDC CITY </p><p>COUNCILLORS WHOSE HOUSES WERE DAMAGED BY WAR VETERANS WHO WENT ON </p><p>A RAMPAGE THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 13.  HE CONDEMNED WHAT HE CALLED </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT\'S SELECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE LAW, AND POINTED OUT </p><p>THAT AT LEAST SEVEN DETAINED MDC MEMBERS HAVE NOT BEEN BROUGHT TO </p><p>COURT WITHIN THE 48-HOUR TIME PERIOD REQUIRED BY ZIMBABWEAN LAW. </p><p>MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI ISSUED A STATEMENT EXPRESSING </p><p>SYMPATHY FOR THE NKALA FAMILY, CALLING ON THE POLICE TO FIND THE </p><p>"REAL PERPETRATORS OF THIS CALLOUS CRIMINAL OFFENSE," AND </p><p>CONDEMNING MINISTER NKOMO\'S NOVEMBER 13 REMARKS AS INTENDED "TO </p><p>WHIP UP EMOTIONS AND EXPLOIT POLITICALLY" NKALA\'S DEATH. THE MDC </p><p>HAS URGED THAT THE DETAINEES BE PLACED IN A LINEUP FOR </p><p>IDENTIFICATION BY MRS. NKALA, SINCE SHE WITNESSED THE ABDUCTION, </p><p>BUT MDC INFORMATION OFFICER NKANYISO MAQEVA TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>POLICE HAVE DECLINED TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03400  02 OF 03  141547Z </p><p>THREATS TO COLTART </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) IN A NOVEMBER 14 MEETING WITH POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF </p><p>REQUESTED URGENTLY BY DAVID COLTART, THE MDC MP SAID ZANU-PF IS </p><p>TRYING TO FRAME HIM FOR NKALA\'S MURDER AND EXPRESSED GRAVE CONCERN </p><p>FOR HIS OWN SAFETY.  COLTART RECALLED HIS TWENTY YEARS OF </p><p>EXPERIENCE AS A HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER AND SAID HE HAD ALWAYS HAD AND </p><p>CONTINUED TO REJECT VIOLENCE.  HE DID NOT EVEN OWN A GUN, HE SAID. </p><p>COLTART WENT ON TO REPORT THAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THREE UNRELATED </p><p>SOURCES THAT VICE-PRESIDENT MSIKA, JOHN NKOMO, GOVERNOR OBERT </p><p>MPOFU, AND FORMER MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS AND CURRENT MEMBER OF </p><p>THE ZANU-PF POLITBURO DUMISO DABENGWA, HAD AGREED IN A RECENT </p><p>MEEETING THAT COLTART\'S "ELIMINATION" IS A NECESSARY PIECE OF THE </p><p>RULING PARTY\'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGY.  THE MDC MP SAID HE </p><p>TOOK THIS THREAT SERIOUSLY AND FELT "EXTREMELY VULNERABLE."  HE </p><p>HAD EVEN BRIEFLY CONSIDERED WALKING INTO AN EMBASSY THAT MORNING </p><p>AND REQUESTING POLITICAL ASYLUM.  HE ASKED THAT THE USG CONVEY ITS </p><p>CONCERN TO THE GOZ ABOUT THE INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC OF ITS SENIOR </p><p>OFFICIALS AND TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT WOULD HOLD THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>RESPONSIBLE IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HIM OR ANY OTHER MDC OFFICIAL. </p><p>(COMMENT: WE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN COLTART IN SUCH AN AGITATED </p><p>STATE.  NORMALLY A CALM AND OPTIMISTIC MAN, EVEN WHEN UNDER </p><p>SIGNIFICANT STRESS, HE WAS VERY BADLY SHAKEN IN THIS MEETING AND </p><p>SEEMED UNSURE OF WHAT HIS NEXT STEPS SHOULD BE.  HE WAS </p><p>PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF HIS BULAWAYO-BASED </p><p>FAMILY, INCLUDING HIS TWO-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>UNREST IN BULAWAYO </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03400  02 OF 03  141547Z </p><p>8.  (U) LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER 14, WE RECEIVED AN </p><p>UNCONFIRMED BUT CREDIBLE REPORT FROM A JOURNALIST IN BULAWAYO OF </p><p>ANTI-MDC VIOLENCE IN THAT CITY\'S HIGH- AND MEDIUM-DENSITY SUBURBS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE, WAR VETERANS HAVE BURNED HOUSES AND </p><p>DESTROYED PROPERTY BELONGING TO MDC SUPPORTERS.  THE SITUATION IN </p><p>THE CITY IS REPORTED TO BE VERY TENSE, AND THE JOURNALIST TOLD US </p><p>"I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS FRIGHTENED FOR MY LIFE." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) NKALA\'S CASE HAS GENERATED INTENSE INTEREST NATIONWIDE. </p><p>IT IS NOT CLEAR WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS MURDER, AND WE DO NOT </p><p>WANT TO SPECULATE UNTIL FURTHER INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. IN </p><p>THE MEANTIME, IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT AK-47 RIFLES ARE NOT EASY TO </p><p>OBTAIN -- ONLY MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE REGULAR ACCESS </p><p>TO THEM -- AND THE ONES ALLEGEDLY USED DURING THE ABDUCTION HAVE </p><p>APPARENTLY NOT BEEN FOUND, EVEN THOUGH THE ACCUSED ARE IN CUSTODY. </p><p>WE ALSO FIND IT INTERESTING THAT MRS. NKALA HAS NOT SPOKEN </p><p>PUBLICLY ABOUT HER HUSBAND\'S CASE, AND THAT THE POLICE HAVE BEEN </p><p>RELUCTANT TO SUBMIT THE SUSPECTS TO AN IDENTIFICATION LINEUP.  IT </p><p>IS CLEAR THAT, WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE, THE GOZ SEEMS INTENT ON </p><p>USING THIS CASE TO INTENSIFY ITS CRACKDOWN ON THE MDC AND ITS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5455 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03400  03 OF 03  141548Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------3E226C  141548Z /02 </p><p>O 141455Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0275 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 003400 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 11/14/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: WAR VETERAN MURDER SPARKS GOZ CRACKDOWN ON MDC AND UNREST </p><p>IN BULAWAYO </p><p> </p><p>LEADERSHIP.
