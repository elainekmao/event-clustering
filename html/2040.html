(U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES ROBERT C. </p><p>PORTER, REASON: 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY. REACTION IN VIETNAM TO THE VIETNAM </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS ACT MAY HAVE CREATED A NEW OBSTACLE FOR </p><p>POSSIBLE LEGAL RECOGNITION OF AN UNDERGROUND BAPTIST </p><p>GROUP.  THE ATMOSPHERE ALSO APPARENTLY REMAINS TOO </p><p>"SENSITIVE" EVEN FOR THE OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED TIN LANH </p><p>ASSOCIATION TO AGREE TO MEET WITH EMBOFFS.  END </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02591  091104Z </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C )  IN A MEETING WITH POL/C ON OCTOBER 6, THE </p><p>REVEREND NGUYEN NGOC HIEN (STRICTLY PROTECT) OF THE </p><p>VIETNAM BAPTIST GENERAL CONFERENCE DESCRIBED HIS </p><p>CHURCH\'S EFFORTS TO OBTAIN LEGAL RECOGNITION FROM THE </p><p>SRV.  REVEREND HIEN, WHO SAID HE HAD IN 1991 LEFT THE </p><p>SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH IN WHICH HIS FATHER AND TWO </p><p>BROTHERS ARE PASTORS, CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN ORDAINED BY </p><p>KOREAN PRESBYTERIANS.  HE SAID HE HAD SWITCHED THE </p><p>AFFILIATION OF HIS UNDERGROUND CHURCHES TO THE BAPTISTS </p><p>IN 1997, FOLLOWING CONTACTS WITH VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN </p><p>BAPTISTS.  HE CLAIMED TO HAVE BEGUN WITH ONLY 10 </p><p>FOLLOWERS BUT NOW TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY 8,000 MEMBERS </p><p>NATIONWIDE, WITH ABOUT 100 HOUSE CHURCHES IN 25 </p><p>PROVINCES (14 IN THE NORTH, 4 IN THE CENTRAL REGION, </p><p>AND 7 IN THE SOUTH).  HE DESCRIBED MOST MEMBERS AS </p><p>WORKERS, FARMERS, AND RETIRED PEOPLE; A FEW ARE ACTIVE </p><p>OR FORMER PARTY MEMBERS, HE ADDED.  TRAINED CLERGY IS A </p><p>PROBLEM;  HE SAID HIS CHURCH HAS ONLY ABOUT TEN ACTUAL </p><p>MINISTERS TO SERVICE THE MANY FOLLOWERS.  HIS FOLLOWERS </p><p>AND MINISTERS FACE REGULAR HARASSMENT, INCLUDING FINES </p><p>AND OCCASION BEATINGS, HE CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C )  ACCORDING TO REVEREND HIEN, HE HELD THREE </p><p>FORMAL MEETINGS WITH THE GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE ON </p><p>RELIGION SINCE JUNE 2001 IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A LEGAL </p><p>STATUS FOR HIS CHURCH.  IN THIS PROCESS, HE COMPLETED </p><p>AND SUBMITTED NUMEROUS FORMS REGARDING THE HISTORY OF </p><p>HIS GROUP, ITS PURPOSE, ACTIVITIES, AND MEMBERS.  HE </p><p>HAD BEEN PROMISED A RESPONSE BY THE END OF AUGUST BUT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02591  091104Z </p><p>DID NOT RECEIVE ONE, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C )  REVEREND HIEN CLAIMED THAT THE PASSAGE BY THE </p><p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>ACT (VHRA) HAD DRAMATICALLY CHANGED THE ATMOSPHERE FOR </p><p>DISCUSSION.  BETWEEN JUNE AND AUGUST, HIS CONTACTS AT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OFFICE ON RELIGION HAD BEEN POSITIVE AND </p><p>"VERY HAPPY," BUT SINCE SEPTEMBER 6 THEIR ATTITUDES </p><p>CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED HOW UPSET THEY WERE WITH THE VHRA, </p><p>HE STRESSED.  HE NOTED THAT HIS CONTACTS APPEARED </p><p>MARGINALLY MORE POSITIVE SINCE THE SENATE RATIFICATION </p><p>OF THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT, BUT HE WAS UNWILLING </p><p>TO SPECULATE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIS APPLICATION </p><p>SHOULD THE SENATE ALSO PASS THE VHRA IN SOME FORM OR </p><p>ANOTHER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C ) SEPARATELY, THE REVEREND AU QUANG VINH, THE </p><p>ACTING CHAIRMAN OF THE HANOI ASSOCIATION OF PROTESTANTS </p><p>(TIN LANH), THE GOVERNMENT-RECOGNIZED ORGANIZATION TO </p><p>SUPERVISE PROTESTANTS IN THE NORTH, SENT A LETTER TO </p><p>POL/C INDIRECTLY BY FOREIGN CONTACTS TO REGRET THAT HE </p><p>COULD NOT AGREE TO MEET POL/C OFFICIALLY DUE TO CURRENT </p><p>"SENSITIVE TIME IN VIETNAM-US RELATIONS."  HE CLAIMED </p><p>THAT THE TIN LANH CHURCH AND HE PERSONALLY MIGHT </p><p>ENCOUNTER "COMPLICATIONS" WITH THE GOVERNMENT IF HE </p><p>AGREED TO MEET NOW.  (NOTE:  POL/C HAD PREVIOUSLY </p><p>WRITTEN TO THE HEADS OF ALL THE MAJOR RELIGIOUS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS IN HANOI REQUESTING COURTESY CALLS. </p><p>REVEREND VINH APPARENTLY CHOSE TO REPLY AVOIDING THE </p><p>POST OFFICE DUE TO HIS INCLUSION OF COPIES OF SEVERAL </p><p>OFFICIAL JUDGMENTS LEVYING FINES AGAINST HIM SEVERAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02591  091104Z </p><p>TIMES SINCE 1994 FOR HAVING PROVIDED INFORMATION TO </p><p>VARIOUS FOREIGNERS.  END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C ) COMMENT:  THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE </p><p>VHRA AND DELAY IN FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OVER THE </p><p>BAPTISTS\' STATUS MAY BE LESS GENUINE THAN PERCEIVED BY </p><p>REVEREND HIEN.  HOWEVER, OVERALL VIETNAMESE SENSITIVITY </p><p>TO PERCEIVED INTERFERENCE BY THE US ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES ISSUES DOES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>HEIGHTENED BY THE HOUSE VOTE ON VHRA.  PASSAGE BY THE </p><p>SENATE WOULD FURTHER EXACERBATE THIS PERCEPTION.  IF </p><p>SO, THERE MAY BE INCREASED OFFICIAL RELUCTANCE TO TAKE </p><p>FURTHER POSITIVE STEPS ON HUMAN RIGHTS THAT COULD </p><p>INTERPRETED BY DOMESTIC CRITICS AS HAVING BEEN ADOPTED </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO US PRESSURE. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
