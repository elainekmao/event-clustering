<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001439 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/18/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NI, ECOWAS, OAU </p><p>SUBJECT: ECOWAS: KOUYATE\'S OAU CANDIDACY (ROUND TWO) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 579 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Ambassador Jeter met with ECOWAS Executive Secretary </p><p>Lansana Kouyate on June 18.  Regional issues, particularly </p><p>Liberia, were the focus  of their exchange (septel). </p><p>Kouyate, in a private sidebar, also asked once again for USG </p><p>support for his candidacy for Secretary General of the OAU, </p><p>as he orginally did at the end of March (reftel).  Kouyate </p><p>suggested that the dynamics of the contest had changed with </p><p>the exit of one main candidate for the position: Ibrahima </p><p>Fall (Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs at </p><p>the UN) had withdrawn from the race.   Furthermore, President </p><p>Konare of Mali, rumored to be strongly supported by Nigeria </p><p>and South Africa, was also not interested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Kouyate said that of his two main rivals for the </p><p>position, the Namibian Foreign Minister, Theo-ben Gurirab, </p><p>and former Ivoirian Foreign Minister, Amara Essy, the former </p><p>was not an enthusiastic candidate.  Thus, only Essy remained </p><p>as a serious challenger.  Essy, who initially lacked the </p><p>support of the new government of Cote d\'Ivoire, gained it </p><p>only after the financial intervention of the Libyans, Kouyate </p><p>said.  Kouyate further asserted that some opposition among </p><p>Francophone nations in the region, particularly Senegal, </p><p>stemmed from Kouyate\'s unwillingness to "act with expediency" </p><p>on the issue of Morrocco\'s return to the OAU, including major </p><p>concessions to Morocco on Western Sahara, and from a general </p><p>and unfair perception that he and Guinea were too close to </p><p>Anglophone nations (read: Nigeria) in West Africa.  Kouyate </p><p>indicated that he now has strong support from regional </p><p>heavyweights, including Nigeria, Kenya and others. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ambassador Jeter explained, as he had previously, </p><p>that the USG policy on the OAU SYG race, as for other </p><p>regional bodies of which it was not a member, was not to </p><p>endorse any candidate.  From a practical perspective, added </p><p>the Ambassador, any public support from the USG could likely </p><p>backfire.  Kouyate said he appreciated this, but asked that </p><p>the USG quietly make appeals on his behalf to African </p><p>governments with which the U.S. enjoyed especially good </p><p>relations.  Ambassador Jeter promised that he would forward </p><p>this request to Washington.  The OAU, said Kouyate, will vote </p><p>in a new Secretary General on or about July 9. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment.  As we noted in March, Kouyate\'s departure </p><p>from ECOWAS will be a loss for the U.S. and for the region. </p><p>He is open and helpful with us, commands considerable respect </p><p>in West Africa, and has been an able and effective manager of </p><p>ECOWAS business in very trying times.  From where we sit, </p><p>there is no doubt that, from the field real and imagined </p><p>contenders, Kouyate would be a very strong and able leader of </p><p>the OAU.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
