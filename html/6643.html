<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 001022 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, MARCH 21: WAR IN IRAQ; POST- </p><p>SADDAM IRAQ; MISSILE ATTACKS ON KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: Kuwaiti commentators who have viewed the end </p><p>of Saddam\'s regime as a fait accompli for months look in </p><p>greater detail at issues in post-Saddam Iraq. Pushing aside </p><p>any thought of generous gestures, one writer states that </p><p>Kuwait should not waive the financial compensation it has </p><p>coming from Iraq as it demands the return of its POWs and </p><p>National Archives.  The writer also calls for the </p><p>implementation of an "Iraqi educational curricula that </p><p>includes Iraqi recognition of the State of Kuwait." </p><p> </p><p>In a striking departure from the pervasive Sunni perspective </p><p>on Kuwait\'s editorial pages, a Shia\'a columnist with "Al </p><p>Watan" discusses the liberal tradition of thought associated </p><p>with the Shia\'a religious center in the Iraqi city of Najaf, </p><p>and suggests that the US should support this school as a </p><p>counterbalance to the highly politicized, conservative </p><p>religious interpretations emanating from Iran "if America </p><p>wants liberal government in Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>One commentator expresses concern that some US-supported </p><p>Iraqi dissidents "have good relations with the Zionist </p><p>lobbies." Another sees "the true goal" of the US as the </p><p>domination and exploitation of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Prompted by reports of bread shortages and stockpiling by </p><p>residents, one writer urges people to remain calm and </p><p>confident. On the news pages, the Kuwaiti Stock Exchange has </p><p>suspended trading, and the Kuwait phone system suffered </p><p>outages in the wake of missile attacks on Kuwait on March 20 </p><p>due to the volume of calls. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  News Stories: Kuwait television carries statement by </p><p>Kuwaiti Ministry fo Defense that Kuwait\'s armed forces have </p><p>shot down two Iraqi Scud missiles launched against Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers are carrying comments by the Dean of Kuwait </p><p>University\'s College of Sharia and Islamic Studies, Dr. </p><p>Mohammed Al-Tabtabaie, that the Kuwaiti military and their </p><p>fellow Muslims are fighting on the "path of Allah," and </p><p>their aim is to defend against the aggression of the </p><p>"tyrannical Iraqi regime\'s army." </p><p> </p><p>On the front page of Al-Qabas, Acting Prime Minister Sheikh </p><p>Sabah Al-Ahmed received a phone call from President Bush to </p><p>thank him for Kuwait\'s support and to update him on the </p><p>latest developments in the region. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan\'s front page carries a report that Kuwaiti troops </p><p>apprehended an Iraqi family that fled to Kuwait by boat, and </p><p>handed them over to American forces. </p><p> </p><p>Sales at local cooperatives (grocery stores) on March 20 </p><p>were three times what they were on the previously record </p><p>day, March 17, President Bush\'s ultimatum to Saddam\'s </p><p>regime, Al Watan reports. </p><p> </p><p>In an interview with Al-Watan, Retired former Chief-of-Staff </p><p>General Ali Al-Moumen, Director of the Humanitarian Aid </p><p>Operations Center in Kuwait, announced that refugee camps </p><p>will be set-up in southern Iraq, but not in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>All newspapers report that the Kuwaiti communications </p><p>network suffered a series of outages on March 20 when the </p><p>mobile network and international lines were swamped. </p><p> </p><p>Military sources confirmed to Al-Watan that Iraqi civilians </p><p>are already fleeing towards the Kuwaiti border and that </p><p>members of the Iraqi military are hiding among them. </p><p> </p><p>According to Al-Anba, Ministry of Defense spokesman Colonel </p><p>Yousef Al-Mulla denied there were any clashes between </p><p>Kuwaiti and Iraqi troops on March 20. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam reports on its front page that the Director </p><p>General of the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) announced that </p><p>all KSE transactions will be halted until further notice. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Aam and Al-Seyassa dailies report that liberal MP </p><p>Ahmed Al-Rubie, in an interview with Saudi Okaz newspaper, </p><p>warned that "sleeper cells" in Kuwait are waiting for the </p><p>"zero hour" of a full-scale US attack in Iraq to execute </p><p>sabotage activities in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "Our Interest First" </p><p>Opening editorial for independent Al-Anba (3/21): "We have </p><p>to take into consideration Kuwait and Kuwait\'s interests in </p><p>the post-Saddam era. [These] interests can be summarized in </p><p>six points: 1) Any elected Iraqi Council must first </p><p>apologize to Kuwait for the occupation of Kuwait in 1990; 2) </p><p>This Iraqi Council must formalize written recognition of the </p><p>Kuwaiti-Iraqi border; 3) The transitional Iraqi government </p><p>must provide full support in searching for POWs, under UN </p><p>supervision; 4) The transitional Iraqi government must </p><p>return the Kuwaiti National Archive; 5) The transitional </p><p>Iraqi government must commit itself to compensation to </p><p>Kuwait for damage due to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait; 6) </p><p>The UN must be involved in formulating the Iraqi educational </p><p>curricula which should include Iraqi recognition in the </p><p>State of Kuwait. We Kuwaitis must demand that our </p><p>government. not adopt the slogan, `let bygones be bygones.\'" </p><p> </p><p>4.  "The Republic of Drought and Graveyards"" </p><p>Fouad Al-Hashem in independent Al-Watan (3/21): "[Kuwait] </p><p>completed a project for a water pipeline which runs from one </p><p>of the water desalination stations in Kuwait to our Iraqi </p><p>brothers who live only a few meters away from the Shatt Al- </p><p>Arab river in Umm Qasr. This is the same river from which we </p><p>brought fresh water to Kuwait [more than a century ago], but </p><p>because of Saddam\'s tampering with the Iraqi marshes, the </p><p>level of the river dropped and became saline. Mr. President </p><p>[Bush], can you or the Arabs, believe that Kuwait, a dry </p><p>country, would give water to the Iraqi people? . We and the </p><p>Iraqis are the victims of one person and we were saved by </p><p>one man and his son, so thank you very much." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Saddam and the Third Picture" </p><p>Awad Al-Mutairi wrote in independent Al-Qabas (3/21): </p><p>"After few days, Saddam will be gone-- either killed or </p><p>defeated. Saddam will be remembered as a person who only </p><p>loved himself, and who suffered from an ego complex. </p><p>Throughout his leadership in Iraq, he attempted to make </p><p>himself a historical figure. He presented himself to the </p><p>world as a knight and an intellectual, but he was not </p><p>successful in presenting both of these images. Therefore, we </p><p>advise Saddam to leave Iraq and to apologize to the Arab </p><p>nations and the Iraqis for all the crimes he has committed </p><p>against them." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "Without the Last Mulberry Leaf" </p><p>Dr. Yasser Al-Saleh wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(3/21): "It is very obvious that the American administration </p><p>has lost credibility among the people of the world. The </p><p>problem of the American administration and Prime Minister </p><p>Blair is that their goal for the war on Iraq has no ethical </p><p>justification. because they failed to get UN approval. They </p><p>failed to prevent the media from revealing their true goals, </p><p>and their suspicious connections with the Iraqi regime, oil </p><p>companies and international contractors." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Why the Need to Stockpile Food Supplies?" </p><p>Ali Al-Mahdai wrote in independent Al-Watan (3/21):  "What </p><p>need is there to stack food supplies and water? There is no </p><p>need to do so. Kuwait today is different than Kuwait in 1990 </p><p>when we were invaded by Iraq. Food supplies, water and other </p><p>consumable products are available and plenty for all the </p><p>people and the expatriates. There is no need to panic at </p><p>this difficult time. We should also not heed any rumors, </p><p>which are aimed at sowing sedition in our society because </p><p>our country is protected. Let the people of Kuwait be </p><p>assured that Kuwait is safe and there is no need to fear </p><p>anything." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "The Dangers of the Next Stage in Iraq" </p><p>Basil Al-Naqeeb wrote in independent Al-Watan (3/21):  "What </p><p>is really worrying us is the US support for some Iraqi </p><p>opposition who are only concerned about the removal of </p><p>Saddam. For example, there is the Iraqi oppositionist Ahmad </p><p>Al-Jallbi who says he has visited Israel on many occasions, </p><p>and that he has good relations with the Zionist lobbies. We </p><p>have to realize that people like Al-Jallbi were the ones who </p><p>supported the Kurds to be separated from Iraq.  They are </p><p>people who have no problems with extorting the Gulf </p><p>countries to reach a balance in the region. If we keep </p><p>silent about them, the US will take our silence as </p><p>acceptance. Therefore, there is the chance for Arab </p><p>countries to express their opinions before a new government </p><p>is formed." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "Washington Between the Hoza in Najaf and the Hoza in </p><p>Qum" [A "hoza" is a Shiite scholarly center] </p><p> </p><p>Shiite Fakher Al-Sultan wrote in independent Al-Watan </p><p>(3/21): "We believe that after the toppling of Saddam, the </p><p>US will strengthen and enforce its relations with the </p><p>religious scientific centers in Najaf in Iraq in order to </p><p>support the non-political religious movements. In its goal </p><p>to change the region, Washington will work hard to implement </p><p>their liberal project by separating religion from politics. </p><p>It is a project consistent with the ideology adopted by the </p><p>religious scientific centers in Najaf in Iraq, which support </p><p>the toppling of Saddam and the establishment of a liberal </p><p>government in Iraq. Morever, the religious scientific </p><p>centers in Najaf will not object to any influence that will </p><p>weaken their [more conservative ideological] competitors in </p><p>the religious scientific centers in Qum [in Iran]. </p><p>Therefore, if Washington wants a liberal government in Iraq </p><p>it has to support this ideology which separates religion </p><p>from politics, and which exists in the religious scientific </p><p>centers in Najaf." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
