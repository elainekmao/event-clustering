<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001464 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DEFENSE ARGUES FOR DISCHARGE - TSVANGIRAI TREASON </p><p>TRIAL WEEK FIFTEEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 1322 </p><p>     B. HARARE 1256 </p><p>     C. HARARE 1149 </p><p>     D. HARARE 946 </p><p>     E. HARARE 568 </p><p>     F. HARARE 484 </p><p>     G. HARARE 360 </p><p>     H. HARARE 313 </p><p>     I. HARARE 250 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Returning from a two-week break, on July 14, defense </p><p>lawyers began arguments for dismissal by concentrating on a </p><p>rule that to convict on treason charges there must be at </p><p>least two credible witnesses - which the state did not </p><p>satisfy given contradictions in Ben Menashe\'s testimony and </p><p>the fact that only one witness, Ben Menashe, was present at </p><p>the Montreal meeting.  The prosecutor responded that a </p><p>conspirator is liable for the crimes committed by his </p><p>co-conspirators - hence Ncube and Gasela would be liable for </p><p>Tsvangirai\'s actions in Montreal.  While the defense </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>presented a strong factual and legal case, it is highly </p><p>unlikely that Justice Garwe will dismiss charges against </p><p>Tsvangirai.  More likely, he might simply reserve judgment on </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>dismissal, or deny it altogether, and go ahead with the trial </p><p>and the defense presenting its case.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Two Witnesses Rule </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Returning from a two-week break, on July 14, defense </p><p>lawyers began their arguments for dismissal.  George Bizos </p><p>concentrated on a rule that to convict on treason charges </p><p>there must be at least two credible witnesses who\'s stories </p><p>independently corroborate each other and describe an "overt" </p><p>treason plot.  Bizos emphasized that you cannot have only one </p><p>witness; you cannot have two witnesses where at least one is </p><p>not credible, or who\'s stories contradict each another. </p><p>Bizos argued that charges against MDC Secretary General </p><p>Welshman Ncube and MDC Shadow Minister of Agriculture Renson </p><p>Gasela should be dismissed because they were only present at </p><p>the London meeting, at which meeting only one witness, Ari </p><p>Ben Menashe, was present. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Bizos also argued that in accordance with Roman Dutch </p><p>law there must be proof of some form of conspiracy, in this </p><p>case that Tsvangirai incited Menashe and his colleagues to </p><p>commit treason.  Bizos argued that in this situation it </p><p>appears as if Menashe was the inciter rather than incitee. </p><p> </p><p>Credible Witness? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Bizos went on to highlight the various ways that </p><p>Menashe,s testimony had contradicted later witnesses as well </p><p>as his own testimony.  He analyzed Ben Menashe,s use of the </p><p>word "elimination" arguing that Menashe initiated its use in </p><p>the Montreal meeting.  He said that Menashe failed to include </p><p>vital evidence such as information on how the assassination </p><p>would be carried out.  He argued that it is essential, and </p><p>that the state had failed to tell the court the exact words </p><p>used in the meetings. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On July 15, defense lawyer Chris Andersen argued that </p><p>the state\'s case depends on the credibility of Ben Menashe </p><p>and that Menashe was not an impartial witness.  On the </p><p>contrary, Ben Menashe had an interest in the case, as </p><p>evidenced by the fact that he received more US$615,000 from </p><p>the GOZ, and his contract with the government was renewed </p><p>after he gave evidence. </p><p> </p><p>State Argues Against Discharge </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) On July 16 and 17, Acting Attorney General Bharat </p><p>Patel argued that a conspirator is liable for the crimes </p><p>committed by his co-conspirators.  Thus Ncube and Gasela, </p><p>though not present at the Montreal meeting, were nevertheless </p><p>liable for the treason Tsvangirai allegedly plotted there. </p><p>Patel also argued that the testimonies of Ben Menashe and </p><p>Tara Thomas were credible and sufficient to require </p><p>Tsvangirai, Ncube and Gasela to argue their defense.  Patel </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>stated that regardless of problems with the transcript of the </p><p>audio from the videotape, it at least showed the court that a </p><p>second meeting did occur and that Ben Menashe, Tara Thomas </p><p>and Tsvangirai were present at the meeting--satisfying the </p><p>two-witness rule. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The state did not substantiate its claims with many </p><p>clear examples, and while the defense presented a strong </p><p>factual and legal case, which ordinarily would warrant </p><p>dismissal, it is highly unlikely that Justice Garwe will </p><p>dismiss charges against MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai.  It </p><p>is possible that the judge would discharge Gasela and Ncube, </p><p>given that they were not present in Montreal, however, more </p><p>likely that he might simply reserve judgment on dismissal, or </p><p>deny it altogether, and go ahead with the trial and the </p><p>defense presenting its case.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
