<p>S E C R E T SANAA 001319 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PREL, MOPS, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: HOST GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE IN COUNTERING POTENTIAL </p><p>AERIAL THREAT </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 155261 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHARGE ALAN MISENHEIMER F0R REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> 1. (S/NF) Information about the missing Boeing 727 has been </p><p>shared with appropriate Yemeni officials in the MOD and MOI. </p><p>The Yemen Air Force routinely monitors aircraft movements </p><p>around the Horn of Africa region, and will be looking for the </p><p>plane. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) However, absent specific information about the </p><p>plane\'s location, or the intentions of its crew, it is highly </p><p>unlikely that the MOD could effectively deploy its limited </p><p>air defense systems to protect USG installations such as the </p><p>Embassy or MTT teams now in country.  We agree with the </p><p>ROYG\'s own assessment - Yemen does not have the resources </p><p>necessary to conduct operations like those outlined para 4 </p><p>reftel. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Please advise if further action is required. </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
