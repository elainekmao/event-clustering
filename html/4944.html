<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000026 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/03/2013 </p><p></p><p>TAGS: KN, IT, PARM, PREL, EAID, ENRG, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTH KOREA: ITALY FLOATS IDEA OF "HUMANITARIAN" </p><p>OIL SHIPMENT </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST: ITALIAN MFA EMPHASIZED IT </p><p>SHARES OUR VIEWS ON THE SITUATION IN NORTH KOREA AND THE NEED </p><p>TO BE FIRM WITH PYONGYANG.  THE MFA\'S DG FOR ASIAN AFFAIRS, </p><p>WHILE UNDERSTANDING THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE USG\'S REJECTION </p><p>OF REWARDING THE DPRK WITH A DIRECT DIALOGUE, STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF GETTING OUT OF THIS IMPASSE.  HE PROPOSED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING IDEA: HAVE THE EU, JAPAN, AND SOUTH KOREA OFFER </p><p>"HUMANITARIAN" SHIPMENTS OF OIL TO NORTH KOREA AS A WAY TO </p><p>CHANGE THE DYNAMIC AND GIVE PYONGYANG A CHANCE TO STEP DOWN </p><p>FROM ITS POSITION.  ITALY WANTS TO GET THE DEPARTMENT\'S VIEW </p><p>ON THIS IDEA BEFORE SHARING IT WITH EU PARTNERS IN A MEETING </p><p>IN BRUSSELS JAN 9.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) IN A STATEMENT DEC 27, THE MFA EXPRESSED "STRONG </p><p>CONCERN" OVER N. KOREA\'S DECISION TO EXPEL THE IAEA </p><p>INSPECTORS AND URGED PYONGYANG TO COMPLY WITH ITS PREVIOUS </p><p>COMMITMENTS.  THE STATEMENT ADDED THAT FM FRATTINI INSTRUCTED </p><p>POL DG ARAGONA TO SUMMON THE N. KOREAN AMBASSADOR.  ON DEC </p><p>30, ARAGONA MET WITH THE AMBASSADOR OF THE DPRK AND </p><p>UNDERSCORED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S CONCERN WITH THE </p><p>DPRK\'S RECENT DECISIONS TO REACTIVATE THE YONGBYON\'S POWER </p><p>PLANT AND EXPEL THE IAEA INSPECTORS.  "A SIGNIFICANT SIGNAL </p><p>DENOTING THAT NORTH KOREA IS RE-EXAMINING ITS NUCLEAR </p><p>POLICIES COULD ENCOURAGE THE POSSIBILITY OF HELPING MEET </p><p>NORTH KOREA\'S ENERGY NEEDS AND RECREATE A FAVORABLE CLIMATE </p><p>FOR DIALOGUE AND COOPERATION," SAID ARAGONA IN A PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON JAN 3, AT THE MFA\'S REQUEST, POL MC MET WITH THE </p><p>MFA\'S DG FOR ASIAN AFFAIRS, AMBASSADOR GUIDO MARTINI, TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN N. KOREA.  MARTINI EXPRESSED THE </p><p>GOI\'S UNHAPPINESS WITH PYONGYANG\'S INITIATIVES IN THE NUCLEAR </p><p>SECTOR, ITS WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST THE U.S. AS AN ALLY, AND </p><p>ITS DESIRE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE USG POSITION ON N. KOREA </p><p>IS.  MARTINI DESCRIBED THE DPRK REGIME AS A RIGID AND BRUTAL </p><p>REGIME THAT RARELY OBEYS LOGIC, AND EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN </p><p>THAT TOO FIRM A STAND BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MAY </p><p>FURTHER AGGRAVATE AN ALREADY DELICATE SITUATION.  MARTINI </p><p>SAID THAT A "HUMANITARIAN APPROACH" TO THE N. KOREA CRISIS </p><p>MAY EASE THE TENSIONS AND PREVENT THE SITUATION FROM </p><p>DETERIORATING EVEN FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN REPLY, POL MC: </p><p>-- REFERRED MARTINI TO THE SECRETARY\'S DEC 29 STATEMENT ON N. </p><p>KOREA. </p><p>-- STATED THAT THE USG IS LOOKING FOR A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION </p><p>TO THE SITUATION IN N. KOREA.  WHILE NO OPTION IS EXCLUDED, </p><p>THERE ARE MANY TOOLS AVAILABLE TO US BEFORE CONSIDERING </p><p>MILITARY FORCE. </p><p>-- UNDERLINED THE IMPORTANCE OF VIEWING THE CURRENT SITUATION </p><p>NOT AS A BILATERAL PROBLEM BETWEEN THE USG AND THE DPRK, BUT </p><p>AS A PROBLEM INVOLVING THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>SINCE N. KOREA VIOLATED AGREEMENTS SIGNED NOT ONLY BY THE </p><p>USG, BUT ALSO BY THE EU, THE UN, AND S. KOREA.  SOLONA\'S </p><p>STATEMENT TO THIS EFFECT ON DEC 27 WAS ESPECIALLY APPRECIATED. </p><p>-- EXPLAINED THE USG INFLEXIBILITY ON DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>THE DPRK BY STATING THAT IT WOULD SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE NOT </p><p>JUST TO N. KOREA, BUT TO SOME OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL, TO </p><p>REWARD N. KOREA FOR LYING AND VIOLATING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.  THE DPRK KILLED THE DIALOGUE WITH </p><p>THE USG AND IT WILL NOT REVIVE IT BY ESCALATING THREATS. </p><p>-- URGED THE GOI AND THE EU TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO CONVEY TO </p><p>THE DPRK THAT ITS MISCALCULATED STEPS MOVED IT SEVERAL STEPS </p><p>BACKWARDS FROM THE DIALOGUE AND UNDERSTANDING IT CLAIMS TO </p><p>SEEK FROM WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MARTINI AGREED WITH THE USG ON NOT REWARDING N. KOREA </p><p>FOR ITS MISCALCULATED STEPS.  HE TOOK WELL ON BOARD POL MC\'S </p><p>POINT THAT ITALY SHOULD MAKE CLEAR TO PYONGYANG THAT IT HAS </p><p>STEPPED SHARPLY BACKWARD FROM ITS GOAL OF GETTING RESPECT AND </p><p>A DIALOGUE FROM WASHINGTON.  HE ADDED HOWEVER THAT THE DPRK </p><p>IS KNOWN NEITHER FOR ITS CREATIVITY NOR FOR ITS ADHESION TO </p><p>LOGIC (HE NOTED THAT THE DPRK AMBASSADOR HAD RESPONDED TO THE </p><p>MFA\'S DEC 30 DEMARCHE WITH A LONG DISCOURSE ON THE USS </p><p>PUEBLO.)  A WAY OUT OF THIS IMPASSE WOULD THEREFORE NEED TO </p><p>COME FROM OUTSIDE THE DPRK.  HE THEN FLOATED THE IDEA OF </p><p>HAVING THE EU , JAPAN, AND S. KOREA DELIVER "HUMANITARIAN" </p><p>OIL SHIPMENTS TO N. KOREA.  THIS WOULD SUSTAIN THE SHIPMENTS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS, BUT USING THE </p><p>"VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION" MECHANISM OF KEDO.  THUS, THE USG </p><p>WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE SHIPMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) MARTINI SAID HE HAD NOT YET DISCUSSED THIS IDEA WITH </p><p></p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     CAC-00   VCE-00 </p><p>M-00     AC-01    NRRC-00  NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OCS-03   OES-00 </p><p>OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  R-00     EPAE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00 </p><p>DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /015W </p><p>O 031644Z JAN 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7550 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SEOUL IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO IMMEDIATE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p></p></div>
