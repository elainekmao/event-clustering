<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001465 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA: JOHN JENKINS AND BILL BLOCK </p><p>PANAMA FOR TREASURY ATTACHE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KCOR, EFIN, PGOV, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: SOCIAL SECURITY SCANDAL HITS FRG UNITY </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1388 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Critics continue to pounce on the ruling </p><p>FRG for the scandal over the plundering of an estimated $45 </p><p>million in funds from Guatemala\'s social security institute </p><p>(IGSS).  President Portillo is rumored to have given the </p><p>green light for a thorough investigation.  The President, </p><p>Vice President Francisco Reyes, President of Congress Efrain </p><p>Rios Montt, and those more directly involved in the scandal </p><p>have shown incredible disunity as each passes the blame to </p><p>someone else.  Few new details of the actual crime have </p><p>emerged, though Attorney General Carlos de Leon keeps pushing </p><p>the case (and accompanying headlines) along.  Former IGSS </p><p>General Manager Cesar Augosto Sandoval turned himself in </p><p>after an abortive attempt to seek witness protection and has </p><p>implicated former IGSS President of the Board and FRG Deputy </p><p>Carlos Wohlers as the intellectual author.  Arrest warrants </p><p>have been issued for all former IGSS board members.  The </p><p>Constitutional Court (CC) overturned the Vice President\'s </p><p>order to intervene in the IGSS, so it remains technically </p><p>independent.  In a blow to Reyes, Portillo named his close </p><p>friend and former Foreign Ministry Vice Minister Jorge Perez </p><p>as the new IGSS President.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>EVERYBODY SINGING "NOT ME" </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The IGSS scandal detailed in REFTEL has brought </p><p>about an unprecedented amount of internal bickering among </p><p>ruling party officials--unprecedented even by the standards </p><p>of this notoriously fractured government.  Well-placed </p><p>contacts argue that President Portillo feels he can </p><p>successfully isolate himself from the scandal, so he has </p><p>given the green light for a full investigation.  The </p><p>implication is that either the Vice President or FRG members </p><p>close to Efrain Rios Montt will be damaged.  FRG Deputy </p><p>Haroldo Quej has frequently called press and opposition </p><p>attention to the case a "political lynching" and has claimed </p><p>that the FRG will come out clean.  Rios Montt and Vice </p><p>President Reyes publicly disagreed over various aspects of </p><p>the case and how well they each know Coban businessman and </p><p>key figure in the alleged crime Gustavo Adolfo Herrera </p><p>Castillo.  Newspaper headlines one day quoted Reyes saying he </p><p>had forgotten that he had once dined at Herrera\'s house. </p><p>Reyes also earned guffaws from commentators when he was </p><p>quoted saying that the Guatemalan people were just as </p><p>responsible as any public figure since they voted for this </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>WOHLERS BLAMES SANDOVAL WHO BLAMES WOHLERS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The three most central figures in the scandal are FRG </p><p>Deputy and "Riosmonttista" Carlos Wohlers, who served as </p><p>President of the IGSS while the alleged thefts occurred; </p><p>former IGSS General Manager Cesar Augosto Sandoval; and </p><p>Gustavo Herrera.  Sandoval negotiated his surrender to </p><p>authorities with Attorney General Carlos de Leon who </p><p>allegedly promised Sandoval leniency under Guatemala\'s </p><p>witness protection law.  In return, Sandoval promised to </p><p>provide evidence proving that Wohlers was wholly responsible </p><p>for the theft of funds.  In the end, the courts asserted that </p><p>De Leon did not have the authority to place a suspected felon </p><p>under witness protection and ordered Sandoval to prison. </p><p>Wohlers has strongly denied involvement, with FRG (read Rios </p><p>Montt) moral support, and counters he was unaware of </p><p>Sandoval\'s activities.  However, a move to strip him of his </p><p>congressional immunity proceeds.  Other members of the board </p><p>have used the same defense. Herrera remains in the background </p><p>as the figure most likely responsible for showing the others </p><p>how to steal and launder the IGSS funds, although recent </p><p>press reports indicate that the former Vice President of the </p><p>IGSS board and close adviser to Rios Montt, Jorge Mario </p><p>Nufio, also could have been the brains behind the scam. </p><p>NOTE: Nufio was the congressional lead on the drafting of </p><p>Guatemala\'s money laundering legislation and it\'s financial </p><p>reform legislation.  He was also a member of the Monetary </p><p>Board, which is responsible for setting monetary policy and </p><p>supervision of the financial system.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>WHO RUNS THE IGSS NOW </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) REFTEL reported that Reyes had almost immediately </p><p>"intervened" in the IGSS after the scandal broke.  Critics </p><p>quickly charged that the Vice President was leading a cover </p><p>up and claimed that the executive had no authority to </p><p>intervene in an independent agency.  Guatemala\'s umbrella </p><p>business organization (CACIF) filed a case with the </p><p>Constitutional Court, which ruled the intervention </p><p>unconstitutional.  Reyes responded that he respects the </p><p>courts decision even if he finds it very damaging to the </p><p>country.  After the ruling, Portillo named his close personal </p><p>friend and former Vice Minister of Foreign Relations Jorge </p><p>Perez to be the new General Manager.  This is viewed by many </p><p>to be a poke at Reyes given his poor relations with Perez. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Little new information has been published on the IGSS </p><p>scandal, but the opposition, press, and even FRG members have </p><p>all been caught up in something of a food fight.  Even </p><p>Attorney General Carlos De Leon has fallen into the scandal </p><p>after it was revealed that he had been an adviser to another </p><p>housing trust fund in which the IGSS had invested </p><p>approximately $7.5 million.  The political ramifications are </p><p>difficult to predict in a country accustomed to corruption </p><p>scandals.  However, the quantity of money missing and the </p><p>clear money trail revealed by money laundering investigators </p><p>mean that someone will probably have to take a hard fall. </p><p>Moreover, IGSS is Guatemala\'s social security, Medicare and </p><p>Medicaid wrapped in one institution.  The populist leaning </p><p>FRG will have a difficult time explaining to Guatemala\'s </p><p>overwhelmingly poor population how it should not be held </p><p>responsible for deteriorating service at the IGSS after its </p><p>administration saw $45 million stolen from the people\'s </p><p>savings. </p><p>MCFARLAND </p><p></p></div>
