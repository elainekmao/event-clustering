The </p><p>delegation will consist of Turkish military and civilian </p><p>officials.  To understand Iraqi\'s feelings against Turkish </p><p>troops, the delegation will meet with the local leaders in </p><p>Baghdat, Felluce and Tikrit.  "Hurriyet" reports that PM </p><p>Erdogan and FM Gul met with President Sezer yesterday to </p><p>convince him to send troops to Iraq without waiting for a UN </p><p>or NATO decision.  PM and FM announced at their party </p><p>meeting yesterday that, in order to pass the motion for </p><p>troop deployment, they might call Parliament for an </p><p>extraordinary session at the end of August or beginning of </p><p>September.  "Hurriyet" also covered Secretary of State Colin </p><p>Powell\'s remarks about Turkish troop deployment.  Speaking </p><p>at the Foreign Press Center, Powell was quoted as saying </p><p>that `I informed Turkish Foreign Minister Gul two weeks ago </p><p>that we want Turkish troops in Iraq.  Mr.Gul told me that </p><p>the issue will be evaluated by the Turkish government in </p><p>detail.  I presume, it will take time.  We trust that </p><p>Turkish troop existence in Iraq would be accepted by all the </p><p>groups, including Kurdish groups.  In order to end the </p><p>PKK/KADEK threat, we are coordinating with our Turkish </p><p>friends.  And we are very pleased with our relations with </p><p>Ankara on all these issues\'. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Response to the Repentance Law: All papers report that the </p><p>response to the law was immense on the first day of the </p><p>application.  "Hurriyet" reports that at a press conference </p><p>yesterday, Interior Minister Aksu stated that so far 444 </p><p>militants had applied for amnesty.  333 of those are inmates </p><p>and 111 are militants.  "Milliyet" notes that four PKK </p><p>militants had already been set free following their </p><p>application. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey and TRNC Delay Customs Union Agreement:  "Zaman" </p><p>reports that Turkey and Turkish Republic of Northern </p><p>Cyprus(TRNC) would postpone the signing of a customs union </p><p>agreement scheduled for today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Iraq\'s Effect on Arab world </p><p>-- US-Turkey Relations/Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Arab World\'s Stance" </p><p>Ahmet Tasgetiren commented in Islamist-intellectual Yeni </p><p>Safak (8/8): "The Arab League\'s decision about not </p><p>recognizing the Iraqi Governing Council was interpreted as a </p><p>surprise development because the general expectation was to </p><p>see a more moderate approach than this.  However, members of </p><p>the Arab League were pushed to make such a decision due to </p><p>their public opinion pressure.  . The fact of the matter is </p><p>that the US is not a beloved figure in the region, and the </p><p>occupation for whatever reason is not approved.  Thus any </p><p>American initiative, including the Iraqi Governing Council, </p><p>is considered as illegitimate. . It looks as though it is </p><p>best to suggest the US withdraw from Iraq at once.  It will </p><p>serve the interest of all parties in the region when and if </p><p>authority is left to the Iraqis before any more chaos and </p><p>more power vacuums.  It will also serve the US interests in </p><p>particular when and if Washington saves itself from neo-cons </p><p>in policy making." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkish PM Dreams of Hosting Bush in Ankara" </p><p>Zeynep Gurcanli wrote in the tabloid Star (8/8): "The </p><p>decision process on whether or not to send Turkish troops to </p><p>Iraq will be a tough one.  . Yet it seems the AKP government </p><p>expects a political gain by taking a risk of sending Turkish </p><p>soldiers to an unstable area.  Turkish government officials </p><p>are trying to eliminate the last bits of worry about the </p><p>policy and intention of the AKP within the eyes of </p><p>Washington.  Ankara is aware of the fact that working </p><p>together with the US on Iraq is the best possible way to </p><p>achieve this goal.  And there is more to that.  Turkey will </p><p>host the NATO summit next year.  President Bush will be in </p><p>Turkey to attend.  The Erdogan government wants to realize </p><p>an extended tour for President Bush with the hope that he </p><p>will visit Ankara before or after the summit.  The idea of </p><p>Erdogan hosting President Bush is interpreted by the AKP as </p><p>the final stage of AKP\'s legitimacy vis-a-vis the western </p><p>world." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
