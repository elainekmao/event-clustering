<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 001033 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/30/2008 </p><p>TAGS: CH, PREL, TW, PREL, TW, VT, VTCH </p><p>SUBJECT: TAIWAN AT THE HOLY SEE: CLINGING TO ITS LAST </p><p>TOEHOLD IN EUROPE? </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  WHILE TAIWAN IS WELL AWARE THAT THE HOLY </p><p>SEE WILL SHIFT ITS DIPLOMATIC  RELATIONS TO BEIJING AS SOON </p><p>AS IT CAN; TAIPEI CONTINUES TO USE ITS LAST EMBASSY IN EUROPE </p><p>TO PRESENT ITSELF AS A MATURE DEMOCRATIC STATE THAT PLAYS A </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS IN ALL OF CHINA AND THROUGHOUT ASIA.  DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RELATIONS BETWEEN TAIWAN AND THE HOLY SEE OFFER UNIQUE </p><p>ADVANTAGES TO EACH.  FOR TAIWAN, RELATIONS WITH THE HOLY SEE </p><p>REPRESENT A PRESTIGIOUS LAST STAND IN EUROPE, ALLOWING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01033  01 OF 02  150544Z </p><p>CONTACT BETWEEN TAIWANESE DIPLOMATS AND THE 71 OTHER MISSIONS </p><p>TO THE HOLY SEE RESIDENT IN ROME.  TO THE HOLY SEE, THESE </p><p>RELATIONS ARE BOTH A BARGAINING CHIP IN ITS DIALOGUE WITH THE </p><p>PRC AND A MEANS TO SUPPORT THE 300,000 CATHOLICS IN TAIWAN. </p><p>FOR NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PRC AND THE HOLY </p><p>SEE TO TAKE PLACE, THE PRC INSISTS ON THE HOLY SEE BREAKING </p><p>ITS TIES WITH TAIWAN, WHILE THE HOLY SEE INSISTS THAT PRC </p><p>RECOGNIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM EMBEDDED IN THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CATHOLICS AND THE POPE.  THE TAIWAN </p><p>MISSION TO THE HOLY SEE TAKES FULL ADVANTAGE OF ITS PRESENCE </p><p>IN ROME TO INTERACT WITH THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY, ENGAGE </p><p>BROADER EUROPEAN CIVIL SOCIETY, AND MAKE THE MOST OF ONE OF </p><p>THEIR BEST LISTENING POSTS.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>A JEWEL IN TAIWAN\'S DIPLOMATIC CROWN </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  JUST AS THE SITUATION OF THE CHURCH IN CHINA IS </p><p>SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS, SO IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TAIPEI AND </p><p>VATICAN CITY.  THE HOLY SEE IS THE ONLY EUROPEAN STATE THAT </p><p>MAINTAINS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN.  DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RELATIONS WERE FIRST ESTABLISHED IN 1942, AND THE HOLY SEE </p><p>CONTINUED RELATIONS WITH THE NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT WHEN, IN </p><p>1950, THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS IN BEIJING SEVERED TIES WITH THE </p><p>HOLY SEE AS A PART OF THEIR BROADER EFFORTS TO PURGE CHINA OF </p><p>FOREIGN INFLUENCES.  THE HOLY SEE MAINTAINS ITS DIPLOMATIC </p><p>PRESENCE IN CHINA FROM HONG KONG, NOT TAIPEI, TO SIGNAL THIS </p><p>IS A "TEMPORARY" SITUATION THAT AWAITS NORMALIZATION IN ITS </p><p>DIPLOMATIC TIES TO BEIJING.  ASYMMETRICALLY, THE HOLY SEE </p><p>PERMITS TAIPEI TO MAINTAIN A FULL EMBASSY HERE IN ROME.  THUS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01033  01 OF 02  150544Z </p><p>FOR TAIPEI, APART FROM THE STAR-CROSSED ADVENTURE IN </p><p>MACEDONIA, THEIR DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN THE VATICAN </p><p>REPRESENTS A LAST TOEHOLD IN EUROPE. TO THE HOLY SEE, </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN REPRESENT A BARGAINING CHIP </p><p>THAT IT WOULD NOT HESITATE TO USE IN ORDER TO GAIN NORMALIZED </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE PRC (AND ITS TEN MILLION CATHOLICS).  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE APPEARS CONTENT TO HOLD ON TO THIS CARD WHILE </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO REOPEN DIALOGUE WITH BEIJING.  THE TAIWANESE </p><p>RECOGNIZE THAT PRC INSISTENCE ON SEVERING HOLY SEE/TAIWAN </p><p>TIES BEFORE CHINA/HOLY SEE RELATIONS CAN BE ESTABLISHED IS A </p><p>SWORD OF DAMOCLES HANGING OVER THEM.  ITS THREAD, HOWEVER, </p><p>SHOWS NO SIGNS OF FRAYING JUST YET. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE TAIWAN EMBASSY TO THE HOLY SEE SEEKS TO </p><p>CAPITALIZE ON THIS FULL DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE BY VIGOROUSLY </p><p>WORKING ALL THE CONTACTS AVAILABLE TO IT TO ASSOCIATE TAIWAN </p><p>WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN IMPERATIVES OF HOLY </p><p>SEE FOREIGN POLICY.  AMBASSADOR RAYMOND TAI, A SEASONED </p><p>TAIWAN DIPLOMAT, MISSES NO OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THE TAIWAN </p><p>FLAG AT VATICAN-RELATED OFFICIAL AND SOCIAL EVENTS.  TAI HAS </p><p>STATED THAT HE IS "GREATLY HONORED TO REPRESENT ALL FREEDOM </p><p>AND PEACE-LOVING CHINESE PEOPLE AT THE VATICAN, WHERE THE </p><p>PAPACY IS A STAUNCH DEFENDER OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS." </p><p>THIS THEME WAS ESTABLISHED WHEN TAI PRESENTED HIS CREDENTIALS </p><p>TO THE POPE.  THE POPE SAID, "TAIWAN IS FREE!" TO WHICH TAI </p><p>REPLIED "LET\'S JOIN HANDS IN MAKING MAINLAND CHINA FREE." </p><p>TAIWAN\'S PRESENCE AT THE HOLY SEE ALSO OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES </p><p>TO MONITOR AND INTERACT WITH CLERGY WHO COME AND GO FROM </p><p>WITHIN CHINA AND WHO OFTEN WORK WITH ISOLATED CHINESE </p><p>COMMUNITIES.  THE EUROPEAN BASE FURTHER OFFERS TAI A </p><p>SPRINGBOARD TO SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS EUROPE-WIDE, WHERE HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01033  01 OF 02  150544Z </p><p>INVARIABLY PRESENTS TAIWAN AS A STAUNCH DEFENDER OF DEMOCRACY </p><p>AND HUMAN RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>WORKING ALL THE ANGLES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  REFLECTING THE IMPORTANCE IT PLACES ON ITS LAST </p><p>TOEHOLD IN EUROPE TAIWAN MAINTAINS A COMPARATIVELY LARGE AND </p><p>ACTIVE STAFF IN ITS EMBASSY. EMBASSY STAFF MAINTAIN AN ACTIVE </p><p> PRESENCE AT ALL OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS MANY SOCIAL </p><p>FUNCTIONS.  THEY HAVE SOUGHT TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN </p><p>ADVANCING HUMANITARIAN AND HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, SUPPORTING AN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8715 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  01033  02 OF 02  150548Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AIT-03   EAP-00   TEDE-00  IO-00    P-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------44CC8B  150549Z /32 </p><p>R 130517Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY SEOUL </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMCONSUL HONG KONG </p><p>AMCONSUL SHANGHAI </p><p>AMCONSUL SHENYANG </p><p>AIT TAIPEI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 001033 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/30/2008 </p><p>TAGS: CH, PREL, TW, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: TAIWAN AT THE HOLY SEE: CLINGING TO ITS LAST </p><p>TOEHOLD IN EUROPE? </p><p> </p><p>ANTI-TRAFFICKING CONFERENCE AND ENGAGING IN A RECENT BIOTECH </p><p>IN AFRICA SEMINAR POST HOSTED AT AN OFF-SITE LOCATION.  THE </p><p>TAIWAN STAFF IS ADEPT AT KEEPING THE PULSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC </p><p>COMMUNITY BY FREQUENTLY \'WINING AND DINING\' DIPLOMATS </p><p>RESIDENT IN ROME, AND ORGANIZING FAREWELL DINNERS FOR </p><p>COLLEAGUES IN THE BROADER DIPLOMATIC CORPS.  THE TAIWAN </p><p>EMBASSY WAS SECOND ONLY TO THE USG IN DONATIONS TO THE WORLD </p><p>CONFERENCE ON THE TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS HELD AT THE </p><p>GREGORIAN UNIVERSITY IN ROME IN MAY 2002.  TAIWAN ALSO SEEKS </p><p>TO ASSOCIATE ITSELF WITH THE COMMUNITY OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONS </p><p>IN THE HOLY SEE DIPLOMATIC CORPS.  IN FACT, THEY ARE ALSO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01033  02 OF 02  150548Z </p><p>GENEROUS WITH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR DIVERSE CONFERENCES </p><p>AND CHARITABLE PROJECTS.  TAIWAN EMBASSY FIRST SECRETARY </p><p>PETER TING RECENTLY TOLD POLOFF THAT A KEY GOAL OF HIS </p><p>EMBASSY IS TO ACTIVELY SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORATE WITH </p><p>THE U.S. EMBASSY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>AFTER THE HOLY SEE ESTABLISHES RELATIONS WITH PRC </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  THE TAIWAN EMBASSY IS WELL AWARE OF THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>DESIRE TO RE-ESTABLISH NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH THE PRC. </p><p>THEY ARE ALSO AWARE THAT THE HOLY SEE IS READY AND WILLING TO </p><p>CUT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS </p><p>POSSIBLE.  PETER TING TOLD POLOFF THAT THERE IS SPECULATION </p><p>THAT FAIRLY LARGE CHANGES COULD OCCUR WITH THE NEW PRC </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AND THESE COULD BEGIN UNLOCKING THE HOLY </p><p>SEE/BEIJING DIALOGUE ON NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.  WHILE </p><p>TAIWAN LOATH TO LOSE ITS LAST DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN EUROPE, </p><p>IT DOES WANT TO ASSIST IN BRINGING DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>TO CHINA, EVEN AT THE COST OF LOSING THAT MISSION.  AFTER THE </p><p>HOLY SEE TRANSFERS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS TO PRC, TAIWAN WOULD </p><p>LIKELY CONTINUE CULTURAL RELATIONS OUT OF ITS CO-LOCATED </p><p>TRADE OFFICE TO ITALY, MAINLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RELIGIOUS </p><p>DIALOGUE.  WHILE CURRENT PLANNING IS TO MERGE THE CURRENT </p><p>MISSION WITH THE TRADE OFFICE, THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>ESTABLISHING A CULTURAL OFFICE TO THE HOLY SEE IS BEING </p><p>CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01033  02 OF 02  150548Z </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) POST SOMETIMES MUST HOLD OUR TAIWAN FRIENDS AT ARM\'S </p><p>LENGTH BECAUSE OF THEIR DETERMINED ATTEMPTS TO ASSOCIATE </p><p>THEMSELVES WITH THE USG.  AN EXAMPLE IS THEIR INSISTENCE ON </p><p>"JOINING THE US" IN SUPPORTING AN ANTI-TRAFFICKING PROJECT </p><p>FUNDED BY PD/ECA.  AMBASSADOR TAI INVITED AMBASSADOR </p><p>NICHOLSON, THEN DCM AND POLOFF TO JOIN THE TAIWAN DELEGATION </p><p>IN PRESENTING A CHECK TO THE CARITAS PROJECT IMPLEMENTERS. </p><p>WE POLITELY DECLINED, SIMPLY REFERRING THEM TO THE CARITAS </p><p>OFFICE.  THAT SAID, THE TAIWANESE, TOGETHER WITH OUR OTHER </p><p>"ACTION ORIENTED" COLLEAGUES SUCH AS THE IRISH, CANADIANS AND </p><p>AUSTRIANS, ARE A USEFUL ALLY IN GAINING THE SUPPORT OF </p><p>COLLEAGUES TO ADVANCE ISSUES WITHIN THE STOLID HOLY SEE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS.  AS NOTED ABOVE, TAIWAN ASSISTANCE WAS </p><p>HELPFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO HOLD A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONFERENCE ON TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS LAST MAY.  POST WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE TAIWANESE ACTIVISM AT THE HOLY SEE </p><p>WITHOUT CROSSING ANY DIPLOMATIC "RED LINES" IN OUR </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) TAIWAN MOREOVER IS EXTREMELY ACTIVE IN THE "ASIA </p><p>GROUP" OF EMBASSIES ACCREDITED TO THE HOLY SEE.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>TAI FACILITATED OUR EMBASSY\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE ASIA </p><p>GROUP\'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN DECEMBER OF 2001.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>NICHOLSON SPOKE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMBATING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AT THAT MEETING WITH TAI\'S HELP, </p><p>OVERCOMING THE OBJECTIONS OF THE IRANIAN AMBASSADOR. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01033  02 OF 02  150548Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA01033 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
