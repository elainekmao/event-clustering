<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 FRANKFURT 003946 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, ECON, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: SAARLAND SPD LEADER CRITICIZES CHANCELLOR SCHROEDER </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: During his April 30 trip to Saarland, the </p><p>Consul General met 34-year-old Saarland opposition leader </p><p>Heiko Maas in Saarbruecken.  The Consul General and Maas, </p><p>who is the state SPD chairman and Landtag caucus leader, </p><p>spoke about economic issues, including Agenda 2010 and the </p><p>upcoming Saarland state elections.  Later, four members of </p><p>parliament joined for a discussion on Iraq.  Maas was </p><p>critical of Schroeder\'s approach on social reform and </p><p>faulted the chancellor for "breaking his promise" on Iraq. </p><p>Maas has gained visibility in recent months by taking an </p><p>active role in the discussion of the Agenda 2010 reform </p><p>plan.  He will challenge Saarland Minister-President Peter </p><p>Mueller (CDU) in the fall 2004 state elections.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>Maas: Saarland Successfully Achieves Structural Change </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Heiko Maas, Saarland\'s SPD leader, is one of the </p><p>"young Turks" in the SPD national presidium.  In an April 30 </p><p>meeting with the Consul General in Saarbruecken, he </p><p>described the economic structural reforms in Saarland as </p><p>successful.  When questioned by the Consul General about </p><p>economic prospects in the state, he said that many of the </p><p>infrastructure projects that are now paying off, had their </p><p>origins in the previous SPD administration.  Maas mentioned </p><p>the Ford plant in Saarlouis, the cornerstone for a growing </p><p>automotive sector in the Saarland, as a prime example. </p><p>According to Maas, the automotive sector employs about </p><p>40,000 people in Saarland.  Nobody in the SPD, said Maas, </p><p>disputes the necessity of phasing out the coal industry.  He </p><p>mentioned renewable energy, nanotechnology and steel as </p><p>future growth industries in Saarland. </p><p> </p><p>Critical of Agenda 2010 and Iraq policy </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Saarland has a majority CDU government, and Maas </p><p>said if the state elections were held today, the SPD would </p><p>lose to popular Minister-President Peter Mueller.  It is not </p><p>enough for the SPD to simply press for reform of the social </p><p>welfare system.  Maas cited the U.S.\'s successful economic </p><p>reform measures.  The Bush administration\'s policies gave </p><p>money back to the consumers and created investment.  When </p><p>the Consul General pressed for more details, Maas suggested </p><p>lower taxes for middle and low incomes, while delaying tax </p><p>reductions for the wealthy.  Maas cautioned that Schroeder </p><p>is skeptical of this.  Measures to increase investment are </p><p>necessary, but conflict with the Maastricht criteria, Maas </p><p>admitted.  Maas said that the money saved because of the </p><p>Koch-Steinbrueck proposal (which advocates cutting public </p><p>subsidies by ten percent) should not only be used for debt </p><p>reduction, but could be redirected in part to promote growth </p><p>industries.  Referring to the Agenda 2010 social reform </p><p>plan, Maas declared early retirement (and thus earlier </p><p>pensions) as the biggest problem in the social welfare </p><p>system.  People rarely stop working after they "retire."  To </p><p>reduce unemployment benefits across the board would be a </p><p>mistake.  Maas would prefer cuts that take the age of the </p><p>recipient into consideration. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The Consul General closed the discussion by asking </p><p>for Maas\' thoughts on Chancellor Schroeder\'s political </p><p>performance thus far.  In a critique of Chancellor </p><p>Schroeder, Maas said it was necessary for the government to </p><p>keep its promises.  Maas, who abstained on the Agenda 2010 </p><p>vote in the SPD presidium, said he had experienced </p><p>Schroeder\'s broken promises all too often.  He mentioned the </p><p>promise not to raise taxes as an example.  On Iraq, Maas </p><p>said: "Schroeder\'s position was not consistent.  To promise </p><p>the U.S. administration support on Iraq and later change </p><p>that line without notification was a mistake."  Maas and the </p><p>other SPD parliamentarians emphasized to us that it was </p><p>important to distinguish the political realities of German </p><p>politics from personal relationships that made up the U.S.- </p><p>German partnership.  Maas agreed with Consul General\'s </p><p>assessment that U.S.-German relations are still solid and </p><p>broad.  All politicians were keen to "built a common bridge" </p><p>between Germans and Americans. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Since the SPD lost power in Saarland in 1999, Heiko </p><p>Maas has been trying to overcome the legacy of his </p><p>predecessor Oskar Lafontaine and give the Saarland SPD a new </p><p>image.  Maas, who is on the left wing of his party but a </p><p>pragmatic Social Democrat, has consolidated his power base </p><p>and is now the undisputed leader of the Saarland SPD.  He </p><p>will challenge Minister-President Peter Mueller (CDU) in the </p><p>2004 state elections.  Because of his reaction to the Agenda </p><p>2010 reform plan, Maas has gained national recognition.  He </p><p>is one of the most outspoken opponents of the plan, but </p><p>tries to mediate between supporters and critics.  His </p><p>reaction was very reserved when we mentioned Lafontaine and </p><p>Ottmar Schreiner, a member of the left wing in the Bundestag </p><p>caucus.  To win the 2004 elections, Maas will have to </p><p>energize his party without alienating the many Lafontaine </p><p>supporters.  He intends to use the former Minister-President </p><p>in the election campaign to help reach out to these </p><p>Lafontainistas.  In return, Lafontaine has promised not to </p><p>run for public office again.  When assessing the viability </p><p>of this electoral strategy, one must bear in mind </p><p>Lafontaine\'s reliability (or lack thereof.)  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
