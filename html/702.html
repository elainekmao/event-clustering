(U) SUMMARY:  ON NOVEMBER 30-DECEMBER 1, </p><p>AMBASSADOR AND MRS. ADAMS, ACCOMPANIED BY AID </p><p>OFFICERS AND POLOFF TRAVELED TO AYACUCHO FOR THE </p><p>OPENING OF AN AID-FUNDED DETAINEE REGISTRY </p><p>CENTER.  US-TEAM ALSO VISITED AN ORPHANAGE AND </p><p>AMBASSADOR MET WITH THE LOCAL UNIVERSITY RECTOR </p><p>AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.  THROUGHOUT THE TRIP, </p><p>LOCAL RESIDENTS COMMENTED ON THE IMPROVED </p><p>SECURITY SITUATION IN AYACUCHO, WHICH WAS </p><p>FORMERLY A HOTBED OF MILITARY/SENDERO </p><p>CONFRONTATION.  A KEY CONCERN OF LOCAL OFFICIALS </p><p>APPEARS TO BE LETTING THE OUTSIDE WORLD KNOW </p><p>ABOUT THE IMPROVED SITUATION, AND THUS IMPROVING </p><p>TOURISM AND REGAINING INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>AND COOPERATION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) AMBASSADOR AND MRS. ADAMS, ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY AID DEPUTY COUNTRY DIRECTOR, AID </p><p>ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE OFFICER, AND POLOFF </p><p>TRAVELED NOVEMBER 30-DECEMBER 1 TO AYACUCHO, A </p><p>SMALL RUSTIC TOWN IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL ANDES </p><p>(POPULATION OF 35,000, WITH A TOTAL REGIONAL </p><p>POPULATION OF 140,000).  AYACUCHO HAS A HEAVY </p><p>INDIAN INFLUENCE.  QUECHUA IS SPOKEN OR </p><p>UNDERSTOOD BY ROUGHLY HALF THE POPULATION AND </p><p>DISTINCTIVE NATIVE DRESS IS MUCH IN EVIDENCE. </p><p>THE TOWN STILL IS HEAVILY COLONIAL IN </p><p>ARCHITECTURE, WITH MANY BUILDINGS DATING FROM </p><p>THE 18TH CENTURY.  NO POLITICAL POSTERS OR </p><p>SLOGANS OF ANY KIND WERE EVIDENT, EXCEPT FOR </p><p>OCCASIONAL SPRAY PAINT GRAFFITI WITH THE NAME OF </p><p>A LOCAL APRA POLITICIAN.  THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT AYACUCHO HAD ONCE BEEN A DANGEROUS </p><p>PLACE, OR THAT ITS VICINITY HAD BEEN THE SCENE </p><p>OF FREQUENT SENDERO ATTACKS AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>CLASHES.  DESPITE THE SENSE IN AYACUCHO THAT ONE </p><p>IS IN A REMOTE LOCATION, ACCESS TO LIMA IS EASY </p><p>SINCE ITS AIRPORT IS SERVED BY PERU\'S FOUR </p><p>DOMESTIC AIR CARRIERS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>DETAINEE REGISTRY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) THE AMBASSADOR\'S FIRST STOPS IN AYACUCHO </p><p>WERE TO INAUGURATE THE AID-FUNDED DETAINEE </p><p>REGISTRY COMPUTERS AT THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS </p><p>AND THE LOCAL PUBLIC MINISTRY OFFICE.  ATTORNEY </p><p>GENERAL BLANCA NELIDA COLAN PARTICIPATED IN THE </p><p>CEREMONY AT THE PUBLIC MINISTRY AND HOSTED A </p><p>RECEPTION AFTERWARDS.  DETAINEE REGISTRY CENTERS </p><p>ENABLE CITIZENS TO LOCATE INDIVIDUALS DETAINED </p><p>ON TERRORISM AND TREASON CHARGES BY POLICE OR </p><p>MILITARY (IN EMERGENCY ZONES) AUTHORITIES ALL </p><p>OVER THE COUNTRY.  BY NEXT SEPTEMBER, 13 SUCH </p><p>CENTERS SHOULD BE OPERATIONAL THROUGHOUT PERU. </p><p>AYACUCHO IS THE THIRD SUCH CENTER OPENED SINCE </p><p>LAST FEBRUARY.  (LIMA AND TARAPOTO WERE THE </p><p>FIRST TWO, HUANUCO SHOULD BE OPENED IN JANUARY.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>ORPHANS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) US-TEAM THEN VISITED THE USAID-SUPPORTED </p><p>ANDRES VIVANCO ORPHANAGE RUN BY SANTA ANA NUNS </p><p>FOR CHILDREN UP TO AGE 18, INCLUDING NEWBORNS. </p><p>FOUR NUNS ASSISTED BY LAY WORKERS TAKE CARE OF </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 150 CHILDREN, ALMOST ALL OF WHOM </p><p>LOST THEIR PARENTS DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS OF </p><p>SENDERO-MILITARY CONFLICT IN THE AREA.  AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL 180 CHILDREN ATTEND DAY-TIME PROGRAMS </p><p>AT THE FACILITY.  (EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE BY </p><p>LOCAL SALESIAN FATHERS TO ORGANIZE AN ORPHANAGE </p><p>FOR OLDER CHILDREN.)  EARLIER THIS YEAR, UNDER A </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL EARMARK FOR DISPLACED CHILDREN AND </p><p>ORPHANS, AID PROVIDED USD 200,000 FOR THE </p><p>CONSTRUCTION OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING WORKSHOPS </p><p>AND FOR REPAIRS TO THE ORPHANAGE\'S DECREPIT </p><p>WATER SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) WHILE IN AYACUCHO, AMBASSADOR WAS </p><p>PRESENTED WITH A LETTER FROM THE AYACUCHO </p><p>ASSOCIATION OF RELATIVES OF VICTIMS OF TERRORISM </p><p>(AFAVIT) SEEKING ASSISTANCE.  THIS ORGANIZATION </p><p>TAKES CARE OF A FURTHER 100 CHILDREN BETWEEN THE </p><p>AGES OF THREE AND FIFTEEN.  THESE CHILDREN ARE </p><p>NOT TOTALLY DESTITUTE, UNLIKE THOSE TAKEN CARE </p><p>OF AT ANDRES VIVANCO, BUT LIVE IN DIRE ECONOMIC </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES WITH RELATIVES OR A SURVIVING </p><p>PARENT.  THIS ORGANIZATION IS HEADED BY A </p><p>UNIVERSITY STUDENT WHOSE PARENTS, WHO WERE </p><p>TEACHERS, WERE KILLED BY SENDERO LUMINOSO IN </p><p>1989.  HE EXPLAINED TO POLOFF THAT SIMILAR </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS EXIST IN LIMA AND HUANTA (IN </p><p>NORTHERN AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>NEW UNIVERSITY RECTOR </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) AMBASSADOR, JOINED BY AID DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR AND POLOFF, MET WITH EDUARDO GONZALEZ, </p><p>THE NEW RECTOR OF SAN CRISTOBAL DE HUAMANGA </p><p>UNIVERSITY IN AYACUCHO, WHO HAD ASSUMED HIS </p><p>POSITION ONLY FIFTEEN DAYS BEFORE.  GONZALEZ </p><p>REPLACED PEDRO VILLENA, WHO WAS NAMED MINISTER </p><p>OF EDUCATION IN OCTOBER (REF A). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) THE RECTOR EXPLAINED THAT SAN CRISTOBAL </p><p>DE HUAMANGA WAS THE SECOND OLDEST UNIVERSITY IN </p><p>PERU, HAVING BEEN FOUNDED IN 1677.  IT CURRENTLY </p><p>HAS TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AND EMPLOYS 400 </p><p>PROFESSORS, WHO TEACH IN TEN DIFFERENT </p><p>FACULTIES.  HE CONTRASTED THE CURRENT STUDENT </p><p>ENROLLMENT WITH THE PERIOD OF VIOLENCE DURING </p><p>THE EIGHTIES, WHEN STUDENT ENROLLMENT </p><p>APPROXIMATED ONLY 3,500.  SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE </p><p>STUDENTS COME FROM RURAL AREAS SURROUNDING </p><p>AYACUCHO.  THE EDUCATION FACULTY HAS THE LARGEST </p><p>ENROLLMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) GONZALEZ MENTIONED PAST PROFESSOR </p><p>EXCHANGES BETWEEN SAN CRISTOBAL DE HUAMANGA AND </p><p>AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES.  ALL SUCH EXCHANGES ENDED </p><p>DUE TO THE VIOLENCE THAT BEGAN IN THE EARLY </p><p>1980\'S.  THE RECTOR IS SENDING THE EMBASSY A </p><p>LETTER WITH PROPOSALS FOR RESURRECTING SOME OF </p><p>THESE PROGRAMS WITH U.S. UNIVERSITIES.  HE WAS </p><p>PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>TEXAS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) THE RECTOR ADDED THAT AMERICAN </p><p>ARCHAELOGIST WILLIAM ISBELL, WHO HAD DIRECTED </p><p>EXCAVATIONS AT THE NEARBY PRE-INCA WARI EMPIRE </p><p>RUINS, WOULD RETURN TO AYACUCHO NEXT MONTH AFTER </p><p>A FOUR YEAR ABSENCE TO CHECK ON THE SECURITY </p><p>SITUATION AND LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>BRINGING UP TO FIFTEEN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS FROM </p><p>THE U.S. TO WORK ON THE SITE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) AS FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMIC SITUATION, </p><p>THE RECTOR EXPLAINED THAT THE AYACUCHO ECONOMY </p><p>RELIES PRIMARILY ON TEXTILES FOR EXPORT.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT EASTER WEEK IS A BIG TOURIST EVENT IN </p><p>AYACUCHO AND ATTRACTED APPROXIMATELY SIX </p><p>THOUSAND TOURISTS LAST YEAR, MOST OF WHOM CAME </p><p>FROM WITHIN PERU.  LOCAL RESIDENTS ARE NOW </p><p>HOPING FOR FIFTEEN THOUSAND EASTER WEEK VISITORS </p><p>NEXT APRIL.  TOURISM DURING THE REST OF YEAR IS </p><p>STILL LIMITED, BUT WORD IS GETTING OUT THAT THE </p><p>SITUATION HAS IMPROVED, AND SMALL GROUPS OF </p><p>FOREIGN TOURISTS HAVE VISITED AYACUCHO DURING </p><p>THE PAST YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>UNIVERSITY STUDENTS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) FOUR UNIVERSITY STUDENT LEADERS ALSO </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING WITH THE RECTOR. </p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT FEDERATION </p><p>EXPRESSED CYNICISM REGARDING PERU\'S PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATES, AND EXPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT </p><p>SUPPORT ANY OF THEM BECAUSE NONE OF THEM </p><p>APPEARED TO BE SINCERELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE IN AYACUCHO.  HE EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT THE MAJOR CONCERN OF STUDENTS IN AYACUCHO </p><p>WAS THE LACK OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES AFTER </p><p>GRADUATION.  CURRENTLY, THE TWO MAIN SOURCES OF </p><p>JOBS IN AYACUCHO WERE IN THE ARTISAN TRADE OR IN </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR AS TEACHERS OR LAWYERS. </p><p>WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE UNITED STATES, HE PAUSED </p><p>BEFORE SIMPLY STATING THAT HE VIEWED IT AS "AN </p><p>ADVANCED COUNTRY." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>SHINING PATH\'S SHADOW </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) SEVERAL AYACUCHO RESIDENTS NOTED TO </p><p>POLOFF THAT SENDERO WAS NO LONGER ACTIVE THERE. </p><p>HOWEVER, A MILITARY OFFICIAL EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>THERE MIGHT STILL BE SENDERO SUPPORTERS IN </p><p>AYACUCHO, BUT THEY ARE NOT OUT IN THE OPEN AND </p><p>HAVE NOT BEEN ENGAGING IN VIOLENT ACTS.  SENDERO </p><p>FOUNDER PROFESSOR ABIMAEL GUZMAN IS STILL </p><p>REMEMBERED IN AYACUCHO.  RECTOR ENRIQUE </p><p>GONZALEZ, A FORMER STUDENT OF GUZMAN\'S, RECALLED </p><p>THAT THE SENDERO LEADER WAS NOT A TALKATIVE </p><p>TYPE, WHICH HE JOKINGLY REFERRED TO AS THE TYPE </p><p>TO BE AFRAID OF.  THE DIRECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY </p><p>TUNA (TROUBADOUR-TYPE SINGING GROUP) INDICATED </p><p>TO POLOFF THAT HE, TOO, STUDIED UNDER GUZMAN, </p><p>WHO HE REMEMBERED AS A VERY GOOD PROFESSOR.  HE </p><p>ADDED THAT GUZMAN WAS A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE </p><p>TUNA GROUP, AND ESPECIALLY ENJOYED IT WHEN THE </p><p>GROUP PERFORMED THE THEME FROM "ZORBA THE </p><p>GREEK," WHICH GUZMAN DANCED TO ON A VIDEO </p><p>CAPTURED BY SECURITY FORCES IN 1991. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) A FORMER MAYOR SAID THAT FORMER SENDERO </p><p>LEADER ABIMAEL GUZMAN\'S WIFE AUGUSTA LA TORRE, </p><p>WHO DIED IN 1989, STILL HAD RELATIVES IN </p><p>AYACUCHO.  (A RECENTLY CAPTURED SENDERO LEADER </p><p>HAS INFORMED POLICE THAT GUZMAN ACTUALLY HAD HIS </p><p>WIFE KILLED.)  A LOCAL JOURNALIST NOTED THAT LA </p><p>TORRE\'S PARENTS NOW LIVE IN SWEDEN.  GUZMAN WAS </p><p>ORIGINALLY FROM AREQUIPA AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY </p><p>BLOOD RELATIVES IN AYACUCHO. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) WITH THE CASE OF FORMER SENDERO HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS ACTIVIST GUADALUPE CCALLACUNTO, WHO </p><p>DISAPPEARED IN AYACUCHO IN 1990, SHORTLY </p><p>APPEARING BEFORE THE INTER-AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>COMMISSION, POLOFF ASKED SEVERAL AYACUCHO </p><p>RESIDENTS IF THEY REMEMBERED HER CASE.  A PUBLIC </p><p>MINISTRY EMPLOYEE AND A UNIVERSITY STUDENT BOTH </p><p>REMEMBERED HER AND SAID SHE WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN KILLED BY THE MILITARY. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) A KEY CONCERN OF LOCAL OFFICIALS AND </p><p>RESIDENTS APPEARS TO BE LETTING THE OUTSIDE </p><p>WORLD KNOW ABOUT THE IMPROVED SECURITY SITUATION </p><p>IN AYACUCHO, AND THUS IMPROVING TOURISM AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION EFFORTS </p><p>IN THE AREA.  WITH LATENT SUPPORT FOR SENDERO IN </p><p>AYACUCHO STILL NOT COMPLETELY ERADICATED, THE </p><p>PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FOCUSING HEAVILY ON </p><p>LOCAL NEEDS AND GRIEVANCES.  TO DO OTHERWISE </p><p>WOULD ENHANCE FRUSTRATION WITH THE CENTRAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN LIMA, WHICH WAS A KEY FACTOR IN </p><p>SENDERO\'S INITIAL GROWTH. </p><p> </p><p>ADAMS </p><p></p></div>
