<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 002543 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU, IZ, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) KUWAIT SEEKS US SUPPORT AGAINST NEW PROPOSAL </p><p>ON COMPENSATION PAYMENTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) At a luncheon in honor of visiting US Ambassador to </p><p>Jordan Edward Gnehm on June 7, Kuwaiti UN Permanent </p><p>Representative Ambassador Mohamed Abulhassan buttonholed </p><p>Ambassador Jones regarding recent developments in the UN </p><p>Compensation Commission in Geneva.  According to Abulhassan, </p><p>the French and German representatives on the Commission were </p><p>pushing for a change in procedure to require that any </p><p>compensation payments exceeding USD 25,000 be referred to the </p><p>UNSC in New York for approval.  Abulhassan said that Kuwait </p><p>strongly opposed this thinly veiled attempt to tie the whole </p><p>compensation process in knots.  The UNSC had already given </p><p>the Commission the authority to make all compensation </p><p>payments.  That was its job; it made no logical sense for the </p><p>Commission to seek to return that authority to the UNSC.  He </p><p>urged the U.S. to support Kuwait in opposing the proposal. </p><p>The Ambassador agreed to relay this information and request </p><p>to Washington and UNSC posts. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Comment:  After the fate of its Gulf War missing, the </p><p>payment of Kuwait\'s many large private compensation claims is </p><p>probably the second most important international issue here </p><p>at this time.  Moreover, the GOK is still smarting from UNSC </p><p>Resolution 1483\'s sharp reduction in the share of Iraqi oil </p><p>revenues going to the UN compensation fund as well as from </p><p>its delegation of decision authority for continuation of </p><p>compensation payments to the UNCC in Geneva.  If Abulhassan\'s </p><p>information is correct, this Franco/German proposed change in </p><p>procedure would all but freeze major compensation payments. </p><p>With GOK morale at a low in the wake of the cancellation of </p><p>last week\'s proposed POTUS visit, adoption of this change </p><p>would be a very bitter pill indeed for Kuwait to swallow.  We </p><p>strongly recommend that the US support the Kuwaitis on this </p><p>issue.  Please advise. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
