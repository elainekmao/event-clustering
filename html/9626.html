<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 OTTAWA 002104 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE, NSC/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OIIP, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03 </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ; AFRICA; ICC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>1.   "Fallout from Iraq" </p><p>The centrist Winnipeg Free Press observed (7/8): </p><p>"...Mr. Bush\'s reasons for going to war may be </p><p>questioned more and more sharply, as next year\'s </p><p>presidential election approaches, if popular support </p><p>for the Iraq invasion ebbs and poor performance of the </p><p>U.S. economy saps confidence in the president\'s </p><p>leadership. In such a context, a conclusion that Mr. </p><p>Bush unwittingly misled the country could be a further </p><p>blow to his political support." </p><p> </p><p>2.   "A casualty of war" </p><p>Under the sub-heading, "Exaggerating Saddam\'s sins was </p><p>foolish and unnecessary," the nationalist Ottawa </p><p>Citizen editorialized (7/11): "...If Mr. Bush knowingly </p><p>cited false intelligence, his credibility is profoundly </p><p>damaged. If he believed in the intelligence because his </p><p>subordinates misled him, the credibility of the entire </p><p>administration is damaged. The ones who </p><p>benefit from the controversy are those who seek to </p><p>delegitimize the deployment of U.S. power. The next </p><p>time Mr. Bush sounds the alarm about a mad dictator or </p><p>terrorist organization, critics will ask why they </p><p>should believe him.... As we and others argued from the </p><p>beginning, Saddam\'s fetish for ugly weapons was only </p><p>one of the reasons why he had to go. Liberating </p><p>millions of Iraqis, and trying to light the spark of </p><p>democratization and reform in the Arab world, were - </p><p>and still are - worthy goals." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "Small Lies" </p><p>Editorialist Mario Roy wrote in the centrist La Presse </p><p>(7/12):  "It has now been proven that 10 Downing Street </p><p>and the White House lied about Iraq. Lied on relatively </p><p>minor points. But that is not what it important.... The </p><p>unilateralism of the American offensive, its real </p><p>justification which was to launch a new and dangerous </p><p>preventive strike strategy, the lack of post-war </p><p>planning and consequently the present situation in </p><p>Iraq...which was predictable and had been predicted by </p><p>the international community tends to give credence to </p><p>an almost brutal thesis: the Bush administration is not </p><p>fit to govern such a big, influential, powerful </p><p>nation.... This administration is showing itself to be </p><p>unable to correctly absorb the long term shock of </p><p>September 11, the toughest ever taken by the Americans </p><p>since the Civil War. Add to this the economic </p><p>quagmire...and you reach a wish, a prayer, a necessity: </p><p>George W. Bush must not be reelected in 2004." </p><p> </p><p>AFRICA </p><p>4.   "Blame America for conflict in Liberia" </p><p>Writer Gerald Caplan observed in the leading Globe and </p><p>Mail (7/11): "...The Bush administration now believes </p><p>it needs Africa to combat terrorism, as a giant market </p><p>for American products, and for its abundance of high- </p><p>quality oil. It needs Liberia to be stable. But after a </p><p>century of American-backed regimes and corporations, </p><p>the Liberian people also need to become a nation </p><p>again - an enormously difficult and expensive project. </p><p>Mr. Bush should intervene not out of great humanitarian </p><p>motives, but out of basic accountability. For damages </p><p>knowingly incurred, his country owes Liberians </p><p>compensation in full." </p><p> </p><p>5.   "Trip to Africa" </p><p>The conservative Saskatoon StarPhoenix commented (7/8): </p><p>"...While campaigning, Bush complained about how the </p><p>U.S. was overextended overseas. Yet, since being </p><p>elected, he has used the U.S. army more than any other </p><p>president since the Vietnam war but so far has been </p><p>unsuccessful at destroying al-Qaida, catching its </p><p>leaders or even corralling Saddam Hussein. Despite </p><p>this, his stock continues to be high with Americans. </p><p>One wonders, however, how long that can continue. As he </p><p>hops through five African nations this week (adding the </p><p>likes of Senegal, Uganda and Botswana to the list of </p><p>countries - unlike Canada - to which he\'s had a state </p><p>visit), Bush must hope he can deflect attention from </p><p>the final leg of his current mandate.... The </p><p>continent is awash in small and medium arms. Basic </p><p>family and community infrastructures have been </p><p>destroyed by war and disease. Both conditions have </p><p>been made worse by Bush\'s decision to stop aid to </p><p>groups advocating birth control (and hence battling </p><p>AIDS and promoting of women\'s rights in Africa) </p><p>and his withdrawal from global efforts to curb small- </p><p>arms trade. He has further alienated would-be democrats </p><p>by trying to coerce countries (all of </p><p>the Caribbean, for example) which refuse to exempt the </p><p>U.S. from terms of the International Criminal Court. It </p><p>would be dangerous to underestimate the determination </p><p>of Americans to carry the war on terror to a decisive </p><p>conclusion. It would be equally dangerous to believe </p><p>that an American president can indefinitely get away </p><p>with riding the economy into the ground, alienating </p><p>allies and allowing U.S. interests and GIs to get </p><p>picked off one at a time without delivering tangible </p><p>results. Bush\'s African trip promises to be the </p><p>harbinger of an interesting year." </p><p> </p><p>6.   "Going into Liberia" </p><p>The leading Globe and Mail opined (7/4): "The United </p><p>States appears poised to send troops into Liberia at </p><p>the head of a multinational peacekeeping force. </p><p>President George W. Bush says he will not be hurried </p><p>into a decision, but the longer he waits the more dire </p><p>the humanitarian crisis grows.... As the Liberian </p><p>violence escalates, the flood of refugees poses yet </p><p>another threat to regional stability. And here\'s a </p><p>point made by several U.S. experts: Chaos, violence and </p><p>the lack of economic opportunities create a </p><p>prime breeding and recruiting ground for killers and </p><p>terrorists, as the Americans found in Somalia. All of </p><p>this adds up to a compelling case for a U.S.-led rescue </p><p>mission. And the sooner the better." </p><p> </p><p>7.   "\'George Bush, save Liberia\'" </p><p>Columnist Marcus Gee commented in the leading Globe and </p><p>Mail (7/4): "In a world ablaze with anti-Americanism, </p><p>the Liberians\' plea for U.S. intervention is more than </p><p>just a curiosity. It is a golden opportunity.... A </p><p>forceful intervention in Liberia by the world\'s </p><p>superpower would demonstrate that the United States is </p><p>genuine when it says that it stands for human rights </p><p>and democracy.... If Mr. Bush listens to his allies and </p><p>does the right thing in Liberia, it will help show that </p><p>his country is indeed a benevolent - not just a self- </p><p>interested - superpower. If he doesn\'t, skepticism </p><p>about American motives will only rise. The UN\'s Mr. </p><p>Annan put it best: All eyes, he said, are on the United </p><p>States." </p><p> </p><p>ICC </p><p>8.   "U.S. speaks loudly and carries a big stick to </p><p>dodge international court" </p><p>Columnist Jonathan Manthorpe wrote in the left-of- </p><p>center Vancouver Sun (7/10): "...Having failed to </p><p>convince much of the world that the International </p><p>Criminal Court, established a year ago in the Hague, is </p><p>a dangerous piece of political tomfoolery, Washington </p><p>has moved to arm-twisting and bribery to limit the </p><p>court\'s effectiveness. The administration of President </p><p>George W. Bush, with the backing of Congress, intends </p><p>to withdraw military aid to about 37 of its allies </p><p>because they refuse to exempt American servicemen and </p><p>women from possible prosecution by </p><p>the ICC.... If the reaction to America\'s attempt to </p><p>protect its people is over the top, so too is </p><p>Washington\'s analysis of the dangers of the </p><p>international court. The Rome treaty is full of </p><p>safeguards - many injected by the U.S. - against </p><p>frivolous, politically inspired prosecutions. </p><p>Moreover, the court is designed to function only in </p><p>those areas where national governments are unwilling or </p><p>unable to act. The court is staffed by highly qualified </p><p>judges and prosecutors, none of whom wants to waste </p><p>time or effort on anti-American witch hunts. The </p><p>court\'s concern is systematic abuses of human rights in </p><p>places where local people have no other recourse to </p><p>justice. So its focus is on places like the Balkans, </p><p>Congo, Burma and West Africa. It would be a travesty if </p><p>this valuable effort at justice-without-borders was </p><p>undermined because of hysterical political </p><p>campaigns on both sides." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
