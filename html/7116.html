End summary. </p><p> </p><p>CENTER SEES VICTIMS FROM BOTH SIDES </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On March 27 and 28, PolOff and the Deputy Director </p><p>of Special Programs Office for the USAID Mission met with Dr. </p><p>Bidur Osti, Program Director of the USAID-supported Center </p><p>for Victims of Torture (CVICT) in the southern city of </p><p>Biratnagar, Morang District.  Originally founded in the early </p><p>nineties to address torture as defined by the Convention </p><p>Against Torture (CAT), the center initially offered aid </p><p>primarily to victims of the police or other government </p><p>entities.  As insurgency-related violence has escalated, </p><p>however, CVICT has expanded its activities to offer legal, </p><p>medical and counseling services to men and women victimized </p><p>by government forces and/or the Maoists, as well as </p><p>occasional victims of other crimes. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) USAID supports CVICT through a USD $600,000 </p><p>cooperative agreement.  The agreement covers medical and </p><p>psychosocial treatment for 500 torture victims at the </p><p>Biratnagar sub-center; twelve mobile clinics; six </p><p>fact-finding missions to investigate and report on incidents </p><p>of abuse; training for 100 medical professionals in the </p><p>examination, identification, documentation and reporting of </p><p>torture cases; and a facility in Kathmandu for shelter-based </p><p>treatment of female trauma victims.  Under the program to </p><p>date, 93 torture survivors have received treatment at the </p><p>Biratnagar sub-center, and 231 have been treated by the </p><p>mobile clinics.  A total of three fact-finding missions has </p><p>been conducted, while 100 medical professionals have </p><p>completed training. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Osti reported that the center has been doing brisk </p><p>business, especially now that restrictions on travel have </p><p>been lifted as a result of the cease fire.  The courtyard of </p><p>the small building that houses the center is regularly full </p><p>of victims waiting for their chance to see the doctors and </p><p>counselors that the center provides free of charge.  Osti has </p><p>worked at the center for three years, and says that the </p><p>profile of victims has changed over time.  While in the past </p><p>the center rarely saw victims of torture by the Maoists, the </p><p>number has increased dramatically, and the brutality of the </p><p>cases is very high.  Cases perpetrated by the army, which </p><p>were almost unheard of three years ago, are now more numerous </p><p>as well. </p><p> </p><p>FEW LEGAL CASES FILED </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Very few of the victims pursue legal action, despite </p><p>the possibility of compensation of up to 100,000 NRs (1300 </p><p>USD).  According to the center\'s legal advisor, only about 10 </p><p>percent of CVICT\'s clients file complaints.  The large </p><p>majority of victims choose to avoid the possibility of </p><p>provoking additional harassment by accusing their torturers, </p><p>while those who do choose to file are often threatened, </p><p>pressured or bribed into withdrawing their cases.  Though </p><p>CVICT offers medical and counseling services to victims of </p><p>both sides of the conflict, legal cases are filed only </p><p>against government perpetrators.  Maoist violence does not </p><p>fall under the definition of torture in the CAT and, more </p><p>practically, Maoist perpetrators are both difficult to bring </p><p>to court and unlikely to pay any compensation. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) For many of the clients who puruse legal cases </p><p>despite threats against their persons and property, the goal </p><p>is psychological gratification more than monetary </p><p>compensation.  According to Osti, security forces in the </p><p>region "operate with complete impunity."  Soldier or police </p><p>who are accused of improper behavior are rarely punished by </p><p>their superiors, Osti said, and victims often want nothing </p><p>more than to see them declared guilty. Even in cases where </p><p>compensation is awarded by the courts, some victims choose </p><p>not to accept the money, especially since accepting it would </p><p>mean a trip to the police station to submit related </p><p>paperwork.  "It\'s enough that I won the case," said one such </p><p>victim, according to Osti. "I don\'t want the money. I don\'t </p><p>ever want to see the police again." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Stories from a few of the victims illustrate the </p><p>reasons for the fear and mistrust of at least some of the </p><p>police in the region.  A journalist at the center had been </p><p>imprisoned for fourteen months during the nine-month State of </p><p>Emergency, apparently on suspicion of being a Maoist.  No </p><p>charges were ever filed against him.  He was at the center to </p><p>file a legal case against the Superintendent of Police (SP) </p><p>in another district, and had already been threatened with </p><p>violence by the SP in an attempt to force him to withdraw the </p><p>charges.  An elderly villager who arrived at the center for </p><p>medical treatment had spent eleven months in jail in the same </p><p>district, also with no official charges or explanation.  He </p><p>is filing a case against the same SP.  The officer in </p><p>question has a history with CVICT, Osti said, charging that </p><p>when he was stationed in Chitwan, the SP was accused of a </p><p>brutal beating.  He lost the case, and was forced to pay </p><p>compensation. </p><p> </p><p>WOMEN AND CHILDREN AMONG WORST-AFFECTED </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Most of the victims who seek assistance from CVICT </p><p>are men.  Only about 12-15 percent of the center\'s clients </p><p>are women, despite estimates that 30 percent of torture </p><p>victims are women.  Part of the reason for the disparity is </p><p>the difficulty faced by women traveling alone.  More often, </p><p>however, female victims simply have a hard time convincing </p><p>their husbands that they need medical assistance.  The </p><p>problem is compounded if a women seeks psychological </p><p>counseling, Osti said. "Women are just told that they are </p><p>lazy and don\'t want to work, and that is why they are trying </p><p>to get counseling.  Psychosocial problems are just not </p><p>considered a health issue in our country, and especially not </p><p>for women." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Though CVICT does not typically treat young children, </p><p>the center has treated a large number of Maoist cadres </p><p>between the ages of 14 and 18.  Osti said he had no solid </p><p>evidence of organized recruitment of minors by the Maoists, </p><p>but he admits that the insurgency has had a devastating </p><p>effect on Nepal\'s children.  In one illustrative incident in </p><p>Bandipur, central Tanahu district, a CVICT fact-finding </p><p>mission came across a 12-year-old boy drunk at 10 o\'clock in </p><p>the morning.  He told the CVICT team that he started drinking </p><p>a year ago, and now drinks every day.  When asked why, the </p><p>boy replied that if the Maoists see him drunk, they will </p><p>think he is a "spoiled child" and not suitable for their </p><p>ranks.  If the army sees him drunk, they will think he is not </p><p>a Maoist, and will leave him alone. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) In studies carried out in Nepalganj, Surkhet and </p><p>Dolakha, CVICT found that children had stopped playing </p><p>typical games like football and cricket, and instead </p><p>exclusively played "Army versus the Maoists."  At least one </p><p>boy had cut his sister with a knife because she was cast as a </p><p>Maoist in their daily game.  "If the cease fire holds, there </p><p>is a need for a massive program of psychosocial </p><p>rehabilitation," said Osti about the coming generation. </p><p>"Everything is about revenge for these kids." </p><p> </p><p>LOCAL EFFECTS OF CEASE FIRE; </p><p>GON TOLERANCE AND GON OBSTRUCTIONS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) For Osti, the most significant effect of the </p><p>recent cease fire has been the reduction in the amount of </p><p>terrorist violence around Biratnagar.  Though incidents of </p><p>violence still occur, Osti says that many of the perpetrators </p><p>are actually hooligans. "They were here robbing and causing </p><p>trouble before the Maoists ever were, and they don\'t obey the </p><p>Maoist commanders," he said.  Osti added that while there is </p><p>much hope that the cease fire and peace talks will succeed, </p><p>there is also a great deal of suspicion about the motives on </p><p>both sides of the negotiating table. </p><p>12.  (U) Also as a result of the cease fire, travel </p><p>restrictions have been eliminated, and victims have been able </p><p>to move more freely.  An increasing number have sought help </p><p>from the center in Biratnagar and from CVICT mobile clinics </p><p>set up in district headquarters around the country.  The </p><p>clinics have had their share of problems, however.  In one </p><p>case, a district prison authority asked CVICT to organize a </p><p>mobile clinic to treat prisoners who were released at the end </p><p>of the State of Emergency.  As soon as the all-day clinic was </p><p>completed and the CVICT team left the area, however, the </p><p>authorities confiscated all of the medication that had been </p><p>handed out to the prisoners. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) The center has occasionally met with disapproval </p><p>from individual members of government, and has instituted a </p><p>secret filing system to protect the identities of their </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>clients from authorities seeking to intimidate.  In general, </p><p>however, the center enjoys the GON\'s tolerance and support by </p><p>many members.  The reason is clear, according to Osti: about </p><p>one-third of elected officials are CVICT\'s former clients. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) CVICT has a well-deserved reputation for neutrality </p><p>in treating victims of torture from both sides of the </p><p>conflict, but the sample of people seeking treatment at the </p><p>center in Biratnagar is not necessarily an accurate profile </p><p>of torture victims nationwide.  The prevalence of alleged </p><p>victims of state violence seeking CVICT\'s help should not be </p><p>taken as a definitive indication that victims of Maoist </p><p>violence are fewer in number, or have been treated less </p><p>severely, any more than the prevalence of men indicates that </p><p>women and children have not suffered.  On the contrary, </p><p>anecdotal evidence suggests that the brutality of Maoists in </p><p>the field has left many of their victims terrified and </p><p>unwilling to risk retaliation.  CVICT\'s challenge under the </p><p>cease fire and in the future will be to reach those victims </p><p>who cannot or will not seek out assistance on their own. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
