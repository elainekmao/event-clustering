HARARE 1081 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Reports continued on June 5 that security forces beat </p><p>MDC activists in high-density suburbs around Harare on the </p><p>previous night; there were numerous unconfirmed reports that </p><p>riot police even beat patients, and bystanders at the Avenues </p><p>Clinic in central Harare on June 4.  The MDC called for </p><p>nationwide marches on June 6, but it is unclear whether the </p><p>MDC expects its membership to show up in force, or whether </p><p>their strategy is simply to cause people to be cautious on </p><p>Friday and stay home.  Police seized weapons at the house of </p><p>an MDC activist on June 4; the MDC MP for the area said they </p><p>were planted.  Most businesses appeared to be open as normal </p><p>on June 5.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Reports of Beatings </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) There were reports from several sources that riot </p><p>police beat patients and bystanders at the Avenues Clinic in </p><p>downtown Harare on June 4.  Elisabeth Sibotshiwe, the </p><p>Principle Matron on duty at the time, acknowledges that </p><p>police did visit Avenues on that day, but denies that they </p><p>assaulted anyone inside the building.  There were unconfirmed </p><p>reports that riot police questioned, beat, and arrested two </p><p>people outside the clinic.  The police then allegedly entered </p><p>the waiting area shouting, and assaulted patients, </p><p>journalists and bystanders with fists and batons. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) MDC Presidential Advisor, Gandi Mudzingwa, and MDC MP </p><p>for St. Mary\'s Job Sikhala reported that security forces beat </p><p>MDC activists for the second night in a row in the </p><p>high-density suburbs of Highfield, Budiriro, Glen Norah and </p><p>Chitungwiza near Harare on the night of June 4 - 5.  They </p><p>both acknowledged that fewer people were beaten on that night </p><p>than on the previous one.  Sibotshiwe said that Avenues was </p><p>"quiet"; she was not seeing an above average number of </p><p>beating victims in the Avenues Clinic casualty ward on June 5. </p><p> </p><p>Marches? </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The MDC ran a full-page ad in the independent Daily </p><p>News on June 5 calling for marches into centers of town on </p><p>June 6.  According to Mudzingwa, the marches were to start at </p><p>10 am, and were likely to be small-scale events with the </p><p>leadership and primary activists participating.  Sikhala said </p><p>that most activists who had been arrested earlier in the week </p><p>had been released, and were organizing for the marches. </p><p>Mudzingwa said that even with the earlier arrests, there was </p><p>still considerable enthusiasm within the party faithful to </p><p>march.  When confronted with the possibility that security </p><p>forces might prevent a march before it even started, Sikhala </p><p>suggested that the strategy was to promote the march and at </p><p>the very least people might be afraid to leave their homes - </p><p>helping to log the stayaway as a full week\'s exercise. </p><p> </p><p>Weapons Seized </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On June 5, the government-owned The Herald reported </p><p>that a cache of weapons was found at the house of an MDC </p><p>activist in St. Mary\'s (a high-density suburb of Harare). </p><p>The GOZ did not claim that these weapons were intended for </p><p>use in this week\'s demonstrations, but state media used the </p><p>seizure as part of its propaganda effort to paint the MDC as </p><p>a violent party.  Sikhala confirmed that the weapons were </p><p>found, but he said that police planted them previous to the </p><p>seizure.  The Herald reported that police seized 22 sticks of </p><p>dynamite, 5 kilograms of fertilizer, one nine mm round of </p><p>ammunition, 22 electric detonators, electric wires, and other </p><p>less dangerous items.  Sikhala did not confirm what weapons </p><p>were actually seized. </p><p> </p><p>Treason Trial </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) On June 4 in the treason trial of MDC President Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai, the state asked the judge to change Tsvangirai\'s </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>bail conditions to bar him from making inflammatory </p><p>statements that might cause public disorder.  The State was </p><p>referring to Tsvangirai\'s comments, reported in the press, </p><p>urging Zimbabweans to participate in the June 2 - 6 mass </p><p>action.  The Defense argued that the law under which the </p><p>State argued its case, Section 24 of the draconian Public </p><p>Order and Security Act (POSA), was too vague, and therefore </p><p>unconstitutional.  Justice Paddington Garwe said he would </p><p>deliver his judgment on the issue on June 6. </p><p> </p><p>Business Almost as Usual </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Driving around Harare on June 5, Poloff observed that </p><p>only about 15 percent of shops in downtown Harare, and 50 </p><p>percent of businesses in the light industrial areas of Harare </p><p>were closed.  Pedestrian and vehicle traffic in downtown </p><p>Harare seemed normal.  Activity in the high-density suburb of </p><p>Mbare seemed normal. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) One or two groups of 3 police officers were visible </p><p>in downtown Harare on June 4; they assumed very relaxed </p><p>postures. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) According to Richard Pope, a furniture manufacturer in </p><p>Bulawayo, about 30 percent of his workers did not show up on </p><p>June 5.  His factory was open, but running at reduced </p><p>capacity.  He said many other factories nearby were open and </p><p>operating, most with an average of 75 percent of their normal </p><p>workforces.  He said activity around Bulawayo seemed almost </p><p>normal with most banks and businesses open. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) There are various factors influencing whether the </p><p>June 6 marches come off.  MDC activists are shell-shocked </p><p>from arrests and beatings earlier this week, but still </p><p>enthusiastic, and even angrier now because they could not get </p><p>earlier marches off the ground.  Security forces are now </p><p>practiced in methods to quell marches before they happen. </p><p>With failed marches earlier this week, MDC leaders are not </p><p>confident a march can be pulled off on June 6.  But it </p><p>appears they are going ahead with the plan, under the notion </p><p>that at least preparation efforts on both sides will cause </p><p>ordinary Zimbabweans to stay at home and thus make the </p><p>stayaway a week long exercise.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
