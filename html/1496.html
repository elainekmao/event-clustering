(C) SUMMARY: THE DCM OF THE BELGIAN EMBASSY IN </p><p>HARARE PROVIDED A READOUT TO A SMALL GROUP OF DIPLOMATS </p><p>OF PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S MEETING WITH BELGIAN FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER LOUIS MICHEL, WHICH TOOK PLACE THE EVENING OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00522  01 OF 02  251556Z </p><p>JANUARY 24.  MUGABE AND MICHEL DISCUSSED ALMOST </p><p>EXCLUSIVELY THE SITUATION IN THE DRC, AND AGREED IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT TO GIVE PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE JOSEPH KABILA TIME </p><p>TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF AND FORMULATE HIS OWN POLICIES. </p><p>MUGABE TOLD MICHEL THAT ZIMBABWE HAD BOLSTERED ITS </p><p>FORCES IN THE DRC BY SEVERAL THOUSAND TROOPS AFTER </p><p>WITHDRAWING SEVERAL THOUSAND LATE LAST YEAR.  ZIMBABWE </p><p>SENT TROOPS TO KINSHASA FOLLOWING KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION </p><p>TO PRESERVE STABILITY AND PROTECT FOREIGNERS AND </p><p>DIPLOMATS, THE PRESIDENT STATED.  MUGABE WAS ALSO </p><p>CRITICAL OF UGANDA AND RWANDA.  THE HEAD OF STATE AND </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER DISCUSSED THE INTERNAL POLITICAL </p><p>DYNAMICS IN THE DRC GOVERNMENT AND THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF </p><p>VARIOUS FACILITATORS, INCLUDING THE BELGIANS AND FORMER </p><p>SENEGALESE PRESIDENT DIOUF, IN REJUVENATING THE LUSAKA </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  MICHEL CAME AWAY FROM THE MEETING WITH </p><p>THE IMPRESSION THAT ZIMBABWE DOES NOT KNOW THE CONGOLESE </p><p>SITUATION VERY WELL AND HAS HANDLED ITS INVOLVEMENT </p><p>THERE IN A "CLUMSY" WAY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ON JANUARY 25, BELGIAN DCM ALEXIS DE </p><p>CROMBRUGGHE PROVIDED A READOUT OF PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S </p><p>MEETING WITH BELGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER LOUIS MICHEL THE </p><p>NIGHT BEFORE TO CHARGE AND POLOFF, AND THE AUSTRALIAN </p><p>AND CANADIAN HIGH COMMISSIONERS.  FOLLOWING HIS </p><p>ATTENDANCE AT LAURENT KABILA\'S FUNERAL, MICHEL EMBARKED </p><p>ON A WHIRLWIND TOUR OF AFRICAN CAPITALS, FIRST STOPPING </p><p>IN LUANDA, THEN HARARE, ON JANUARY 24.  (NOTE: MICHEL IS </p><p>PROCEEDING TO KIGALI AND KAMPALA JANUARY 25, THEN </p><p>LIBREVILLE, AND MAY STOP AGAIN IN KINSHASA BEFORE </p><p>RETURNING TO BRUSSELS.  END NOTE.)  IN THE EVENING OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00522  01 OF 02  251556Z </p><p>JANUARY 24, MICHEL WAS MET BY ZIMBABWE FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>STAN MUDENGE AT HARARE\'S AIRPORT, WHERE THEY TALKED FOR </p><p>NEARLY AN HOUR, BEFORE PROCEEDING TO A HASTILY ARRANGED, </p><p>EARLY EVENING MEETING WITH THE ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT.  THE </p><p>TWO, ACCOMPANIED BY THE BELGIAN DCM, MET AT MUGABE\'S </p><p>RESIDENCE.  DE CROMBRUGGHE REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT </p><p>WAS CHARMING, AND APPEARED ENERGETIC AND IN GOOD HEALTH, </p><p>DESPITE RECENT REPORTS TO THE CONTRARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN FOREIGN MINISTER MICHEL </p><p>AND MUGABE AND MUDENGE FOCUSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE </p><p>DRC SITUATION.  MUGABE AND MICHEL AGREED THAT IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT TO GIVE JOSEPH KABILA TIME TO ESTABLISH </p><p>HIMSELF AND FORMULATE HIS OWN POLICIES.  THE TWO AGREED </p><p>THAT THE JUNIOR KABILA COULD NONETHELESS ENHANCE HIS </p><p>LEGITIMACY BY OPENING A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THE </p><p>POLITICAL OPPOSITION.  MUGABE STATED THAT HE SHOULD AT </p><p>LEAST SEND A SIGNAL TO THE REBELS TO INDICATE HE IS </p><p>INTERESTED IN NEGOTIATING.  MUGABE NOTED THAT THE ELDER </p><p>KABILA HAD BEGUN A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS IN </p><p>LIBREVILLE.  THE ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT DID NOT EXPECT THE </p><p>DRC GOVERNMENT TO IMMEDIATELY OPEN UP TO THE OPPOSITION, </p><p>BUT SAID HE WOULD NOT GET "PUSHY" WITH KABILA.  MUGABE </p><p>WAS NON-COMMITTAL ABOUT JOSEPH KABILA, AND IMPLIED A FEW </p><p>TIMES THAT HE IS A TRANSITIONAL FIGURE, ACCORDING TO DE </p><p>CROMBRUGGHE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MUGABE TOLD MICHEL THAT ZIMBABWE NOW HAS ABOUT </p><p>13,000 TROOPS IN THE DRC.  THE GOZ HAD WITHDRAWN BETWEEN </p><p>3,000 AND 5,000 TROOPS LATE LAST YEAR, BUT WAS FORCED TO </p><p>REAUGMENT ITS FORCE WHEN PWETO FELL TO THE REBELS AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00522  01 OF 02  251556Z </p><p>WHEN KABILA WAS ASSASSINATED, MUGABE SAID.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT FURTHER EXPLAINED THAT WHEN THE REBELS TOOK </p><p>PWETO, THEY TRAPPED SEVERAL HUNDRED ZIMBABWEAN TROOPS </p><p>BETWEEN LAKES MWERU AND TANGANYIKA.  THE TROOPS WERE </p><p>INSTRUCTED NOT TO FIGHT BUT TO RETREAT ACROSS THE BORDER </p><p>INTO ZAMBIA.  MUGABE HINTED AT SOME UNHAPPINESS WITH THE </p><p>ELDER KABILA WHEN HE UNILATERALLY DECIDED TO ATTACK </p><p>PEPA, AND THE RWANDAN COUNTERATTACK RESULTED IN THE FALL </p><p>OF PWETO. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MUGABE STRESSED TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE SENT MORE TROOPS TO KINSHASA IN THE WAKE OF </p><p>KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION TO "MAINTAIN LAW AND ORDER" AND </p><p>TO PROTECT RESIDENT FOREIGNERS AND DIPLOMATS.  MUGABE </p><p>BLITHELY SUGGESTED THAT THE WEST CONTRIBUTE FINANCIALLY </p><p>TO ZIMBABWE\'S INTERVENTION, SINCE IT WAS COSTING </p><p>ZIMBABWE SO MUCH TO PROVIDE THIS VALUABLE SERVICE.  THE </p><p>GOZ WAS FORCED TO INTERVENE "BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY DID NOT DO THE JOB," MUGABE REMARKED. </p><p>BESIDES, ZIMBABWE CANNOT LEAVE A POLITICAL VACUUM IN </p><p>KINSHASA, NOR CAN IT RISK THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7207 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00522  02 OF 02  251556Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------BB8127  251556Z /38 </p><p>O 251553Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8086 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>RWANDA COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY LIBREVILLE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000522 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 X5 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: READOUT ON MEETING BETWEEN ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT </p><p>AND BELGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>STARTING SOME KIND OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT MASS ACTION, HE </p><p>TOLD MICHEL.  MUDENGE EARLIER REPORTEDLY ADMITTED IT IS </p><p>A "NIGHTMARE" TO MAINTAIN SO MANY TROOPS IN THE DRC WHEN </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S OWN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS FAST </p><p>APPROACHING. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  MUGABE AND MUDENGE WERE FAIRLY CRITICAL OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00522  02 OF 02  251556Z </p><p>RWANDA, UGANDA AND THEIR REBEL SURROGATES.  MUDENGE </p><p>NOTED THAT EVEN THOUGH RWANDA HAD PROMISED TO WITHDRAW </p><p>ITS FORCES 200KM, IT INSTEAD ADVANCED 200KM TO TAKE </p><p>PWETO.  ZIMBABWE IS ALSO WORRIED THAT BEMBA\'S FORCES </p><p>CONTINUE TO ADVANCE IN NORTHERN DRC.  MUDENGE REMARKED </p><p>THAT BEMBA\'S WAR IS REALLY UGANDAN PRESIDENT MUSEVENI\'S </p><p>WAR, AND THAT MUSEVENI IS THE KEY TO RESOLVING THAT PART </p><p>OF THE CONFLICT.  MUDENGE WENT AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE </p><p>U.S. HAS GIVEN MUSEVENI CARTE BLANCHE IN NORTHERN CONGO </p><p>IN ORDER TO KEEP SUDAN OUT.  MUGABE STATED THAT UGANDA </p><p>AND RWANDA SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THEIR CONGOLESE </p><p>BORDER PROBLEMS VIA BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DRC. </p><p>AS FOR THE RCD-GOMA REBEL GROUP, MUDENGE OPINED THAT </p><p>THEY WOULD NEVER ACCEPT A DEMOCRATIC CONGO BECAUSE THEY </p><p>ARE SO UNPOPULAR AND WOULD LOSE IN ANY ELECTION. </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER MICHEL SAID HE WOULD TRY TO PERSUADE </p><p>RCD-GOMA TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONGOLESE DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ON THE LUSAKA PEACE PROCESS, MUDENGE SAID </p><p>ZIMBABWE HAS ENCOURAGED JOSEPH KABILA TO KEEP FORMER </p><p>BOTSWANA PRESIDENT MASIRE AS PEACE FACILITATOR, BUT </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED TO MICHEL THAT CREATIVITY WAS NEEDED IN </p><p>FINDING A WAY TO SUPPLEMENT HIS EFFORTS.  MUGABE </p><p>INTERJECTED, SAYING THAT THE PEACE PROCESS SHOULD NOT </p><p>DEPEND ON MASIRE ENTIRELY, ESPECIALLY SINCE HE DOES NOT </p><p>SPEAK FRENCH.  GABON PRESIDENT BONGO ADDS A NEW </p><p>DIMENSION TO THE PEACE PROCESS, BUT FORMER SENEGALESE </p><p>PRESIDENT ABDOU DIOUF MAY ULTIMATELY BE A BETTER </p><p>FACILITATOR, MUDENGE OFFERED.  FOREIGN MINISTER MICHEL </p><p>STATED THAT BELGIUM SUPPORTS MASIRE, AND SUGGESTED </p><p>BRUSSELS COULD ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN GETTING THE PEACE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00522  02 OF 02  251556Z </p><p>PROCESS GOING AGAIN.  HE INVITED MUDENGE TO BRUSSELS TO </p><p>FURTHER THE DIALOGUE.  MUDENGE REPORTED THAT HE IS GOING </p><p>TO NEW YORK FOR THE FEBRUARY 21 UN SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>MEETING OF FOREIGN MINISTERS INVOLVED IN THE DRC WAR. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE BELGIAN DELEGATION COMMENTED AMONG </p><p>THEMSELVES, AND LATER TO US, THAT THEY DO NOT BELIEVE </p><p>THE ZIMBABWE LEADERSHIP HAS A VERY GOOD GRASP OF THE </p><p>POLITICAL DYNAMICS INSIDE THE DRC.  THEY NOTED THAT THE </p><p>GOZ IS MORE CLOSELY LINKED TO THE OLD GUARD FIGURES OF </p><p>INTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER KAKUDJI AND JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>KONGOLO.  THE BELGIAN AMBASSADOR IN KINSHASA REPORTS </p><p>THAT THE CONGOLESE AMBASSADOR TO ZIMBABWE, KIKAYA BIN </p><p>KARUBI, IS PART OF THE SO-CALLED "NEW GUARD" OF UP-AND- </p><p>COMERS.  THE GOZ\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH THE POLITICAL </p><p>OPPOSITION FIGURE AND INTELLECTUAL ARTHUR ZAHIDI NGOMA </p><p>AS A POTENTIAL PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSOR DISPLAYS THEIR </p><p>NAIVETE, THE BELGIANS REMARKED.  MICHEL COMMENTED TO HIS </p><p>STAFF LATER THAT HE THINKS ZIMBABWE\'S HANDLING OF THE </p><p>CONGO INTERVENTION HAS BEEN "CLUMSY" FROM THE START. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
