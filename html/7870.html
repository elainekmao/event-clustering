<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001284 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, PARM, CA, Missile Defense </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN CABINET DISCUSSES MISSILE DEFENSE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) OTTAWA 1123 (B) OTTAWA 492 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The Canadian Cabinet discussed missile defense </p><p>cooperation with the U.S. in its May 6 meeting, but reached </p><p>no conclusion and will continue discussions on May 13. </p><p>Foreign Minister Graham and Defense Minister McCallum briefed </p><p>Cabinet and encouraged a decision to engage in missile </p><p>defense negotations with the U.S.  Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>Manley told the Ambassador after the meeting that a consensus </p><p>seems to be forming in favor of missile defense negotiations, </p><p>and that some Cabinet officials whom he expected to be </p><p>opposed were grudgingly supportive.  He also noted that </p><p>Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, who is publicly opposed to </p><p>Canadian participation in missile defense, did not attend the </p><p>meeting. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Foreign Affairs sources told us that the lack of a </p><p>Cabinet decision did not indicate a change in course.  Given </p><p>"differing views" and other topics on the Cabinet agenda, </p><p>there simply was not enough time to hear from all Cabinet </p><p>members who wanted to speak on missile defense.  They </p><p>cautioned that there will be intense debate in the days </p><p>ahead, including at the Liberal MPs\' weekly caucus meeting on </p><p>May 7.  But they expected Cabinet to approve a negotiating </p><p>mandate on May 13, and said that senior Canadian officials </p><p>(probably Foreign Affairs Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) Jim </p><p>Wright and Defense ADM Ken Calder) would want to visit </p><p>Washington in the following days for preliminary discussions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Up until now, the GoC has carefully avoided taking a </p><p>position on missile defense.  Chretien made his first </p><p>positive public comments on May 5, telling Commons that </p><p>"there has been an evolution in this file" with Russia and </p><p>China toning down their opposition, and saying that the GoC </p><p>is reconsidering the program.  A few Liberal and opposition </p><p>MPs immediately responded, criticizing missile defense as </p><p>leading to a new arms race.  The chairman of the Foreign </p><p>Affairs Committee recalled that the Committee had recommended </p><p>against participation as recently as December. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Missile defense has also become an issue in the race </p><p>to succeed Chretien, which will be decided at the Liberal </p><p>Party leadership convention in November.  Last week, </p><p>leadership frontrunner Paul Martin announced his support for </p><p>missile defense cooperation with the U.S., which prompted </p><p>Heritage Minister Copps, another leadership candidate, to </p><p>reiterate her opposition.  Deputy Prime Minister Manley, the </p><p>third Liberal leadership contender, is known to support </p><p>Canadian participation in missile defense but has not yet </p><p>gone public. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: Graham and McCallum agreed in October that it </p><p>made sense for Canada to participate in North American </p><p>missile defense, but this proposed policy shift has been </p><p>closely held until now (reftels).  Martin\'s endorsement </p><p>lessens opposition within caucus, as most Liberal MPs want to </p><p>stay onside with him.  There will be much criticism in coming </p><p>days by opposition MPs and journalists, who charge that the </p><p>Government\'s shift is an attempt to curry favor with the U.S. </p><p>after the fallout over Iraq.  But with Chretien apparently on </p><p>board, we expect to finally get a decision from Cabinet on </p><p>May 13 to proceed with negotiations. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
