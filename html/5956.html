<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000374 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DRL FOR CRANER; DEPT FOR NEA-ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, YM, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: 2002 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT FOR YEMEN MUST BE CREDIBLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  The Human Rights Report is a vital tool in </p><p>Post\'s efforts to improve human rights in Yemen, and its </p><p>credibility is central to that effort.  The draft 2002 Human </p><p>Rights Report for Yemen is in danger of a damaging lack of </p><p>credibility unless the report reflects the facts more </p><p>accurately.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The Human Rights Report (HRR) is taken seriously in </p><p>Yemen, both by the government and the public.  In the last </p><p>couple of years, it was translated and published in several </p><p>newspapers in its entirety.  Several conferences were held, </p><p>and the ROYG published a point-by-point response to the 2001 </p><p>report in both Arabic and English newspapers. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Post\'s experience is that the HRR is the best tool </p><p>available in encouraging improvements in Yemen\'s human </p><p>rights.  Progress was made in several areas over the last few </p><p>years, at least in part because of the HRR and Post\'s </p><p>engagement on the issue.  For example, Post has witnessed a </p><p>marked improvement in the treatment of detainees and </p><p>prisoners by the Political Security Organization (PSO), in </p><p>part due to highlighting abuse in past HRRs and training </p><p>their forces in human rights during counter-terrorism </p><p>training.  Citizens\' ability to change their government has </p><p>also improved over the last few years, with the establishment </p><p>of local government and more widespread competition between </p><p>political parties. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Because of the importance of the HRR tool in </p><p>pressing the ROYG for changes in its human rights practices, </p><p>the HRR must be strongly credible or the chance for change is </p><p>diminished.  There are several areas of the draft 2002 report </p><p>where credibility is in danger, including the following: </p><p> </p><p>--    Terrorist suspects detained by the ROYG at U.S. </p><p>government request:  Post suggests an acknowledgment be made </p><p>by using phrasing that alludes to "partners in the war on </p><p>terrorism." </p><p> </p><p>--    Prosecution of the USS Cole detainees was delayed at </p><p>U.S. government request to allow time for investigation: </p><p>Post suggests language that alludes to "international law </p><p>enforcement partners" in explaining why detainees were held </p><p>beyond normal time limits. </p><p> </p><p>--    Yemeni security forces did not kill persons this year </p><p>in an unlawful or extrajudicial manner.  All instances of </p><p>death by security forces in the draft report came about </p><p>during legitimate law enforcement activities pursuing </p><p>terrorists, including the November 3 attack on al-Qaeda. </p><p>Post suggests that the language "Members of the security </p><p>forces killed a number of persons during the year" be changed </p><p>to "There were no reports of arbitrary or unlawful </p><p>deprivation of life committed by the Government or its </p><p>agents." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  In President Bush\'s State of the Union address, the </p><p>predator attack on November 3 against al-Qaeda was </p><p>highlighted as a significant success in the war on terror. </p><p>It is inconsistent that a report from the Department of State </p><p>would indicate that the same killing is extrajudicial or </p><p>unlawful. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
