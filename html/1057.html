<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ATHENS 001917 </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE PASS TO S/SA JIM DOBBINS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL:  04/18/02 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, ECIN, ZL, GR </p><p>SUBJECT:  ENGAGING GREECE ON THE BALKANS: WHAT A DIFFERENCE A </p><p>YEAR CAN MAKE </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION TERRY R. SNELL, REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) LAST APRIL OUR EMBASSY ENDURED DAILY DEMONSTRATIONS, MANY </p><p>OF THEM VIOLENT, BY ANGRY GREEKS PROTESTING THE NATO AIR CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST SERBIA.  EMOTIONS RAN HIGH WITH ANTI-AMERICANISM AND PRO- </p><p>SERB EMOTIONALISM OFTEN TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>POLLS INDICATED OVER 90 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION OPPOSED THE AIR </p><p>STRIKES, PRIME MINISTER SIMITIS AND FOREIGN MINISTER PAPANDREOU </p><p>PERFORMED A DELICATE BALANCING ACT BY KEEPING GREECE FROM </p><p>RUPTURING THE NATO CONSENSUS.  THE GREEK GOVERNMENT ON APRIL 21- </p><p>22 WILL BE UNOFFICIALLY CO-HOSTING A SERB OPPOSITION LEADERS </p><p>CONFERENCE IN ATHENS.  NO ONE IN THE GREEK GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS </p><p>THE PREMISE THAT THE MILOSEVIC REGIME MUST GO.  GREEK DIFFERENCES </p><p>WITH THE U.S. ARE CENTERED ON THE APPROPRIATE TACTICS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>THE EFFICACY OF CONTINUED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST BELGRADE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) TEN DAYS AGO, LARGELY FOR DOMESTIC ECONOMIC REASONS, </p><p>VOTERS RE-ELECTED THE SIMITIS GOVERNMENT FOR A SECOND TERM.  WITH </p><p>PASOK THE WINNER IN THE LAST THREE ELECTIONS, PM SIMITIS IS </p><p>STARTING TO STRIP THE PARTY OF ITS ANDREAS PAPANDREOU LEGACY AND </p><p>FIRMLY ESTABLISH GREECE IN EUROPE\'S PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL CENTER. </p><p>DESPITE SOME CHANGES AT THE SUBMINISTERIAL LEVEL, THE FOREIGN AND </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTRIES CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE PROMOTING </p><p>RAPPROCHEMENT WITH TURKEY, AN INCREASED GREEK ROLE IN THE BALKANS </p><p>AND A PRODUCTIVE, COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) PM SIMITIS WILL BE PRESENTING THE NEW GOVERNMENT\'S PROGRAM </p><p>TO THE PARLIAMENT ON APRIL 21.  GREECE WILL JOIN THE EUROPEAN AND </p><p>ECONOMIC MONETARY UNION (EMU) IN JANUARY AND MUCH OF SIMITIS\'S </p><p>PROGRAM WILL BE DEVOTED TO STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN THE </p><p>REQUIRED MACROECONOMIC DISCIPLINE IMPOSED BY EMU AND A </p><p>RESTRUCTURING OF GOVERNMENT SOCIAL PROGRAMS IMPORTANT TO MOST </p><p>GREEKS AND ESPECIALLY PASOK\'S CONSTITUENCY.  SIMITIS BELIEVES IN </p><p>CABINET GOVERNMENT AND FM PAPANDREOU WILL TAKE THE LEAD IN </p><p>SHAPING GREECE\'S FOREIGN POLICY.  AS IN THE LAST GOVERNMENT, </p><p>IMLEMENTATION OF ANY NEW INITIATIVES ARE LIKELY TO BE SLOWED BY </p><p>AN INEFFICIENT AND UNCOORDINATED GREEK FOREIGN MINISTRY </p><p>BUREAUCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN YOUR MEETINGS WITH PAPANDREOU AND DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>TSOHATZOPOULOS, YOUR OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE TO ENCOURAGE GREECE TO </p><p>TAKE ON A GREATER LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMING </p><p>SOUTHEAST EUROPE.   WHILE RECOGNIZING GREECE\'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO </p><p>STABILITY IN THE REGION, YOU MAY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR </p><p>GREATER FOLLOW THROUGH BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>PERFORMANCE MATCHES PUBLIC RHETORIC.  THE FOLLOWING POINTS COVER </p><p>SOME OF THE SPECIFIC BALKAN ISSUES YOU MAY WANT TO RAISE: </p><p> </p><p>-- APPRECIATE GREECE\'S CONTRIBUTION OF TROOPS TO KFOR AND SFOR. </p><p>GREEK SUPPORT FOR MODERATE SERB KOSOVARS CAN PROVE VITAL IN </p><p>BUILDING A MULTI-ETHNIC SOCIETY IN KOSOVO. </p><p> </p><p>-- REITERATE U.S. POLICY ON NO CHANGE OF BORDERS IN THE BALKANS. </p><p> </p><p>-- IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON MILOSEVIC REGIME THROUGH </p><p>STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.  MUST ISOLATE BELGRADE </p><p>AND CUT-OFF HARD CURRENCY EARNINGS USED TO PROP UP THE REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>-- HIGHLIGHT NEED FOR SUPPORT IN EU TO ACCELERATE ECONOMIC </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO MONTENEGRO. </p><p> </p><p>-- ENCOURAGE GREATER PUBLIC SUPPORT BY GREECE FOR SERB </p><p>OPPOSITION, INCLUDING NGOS AND OTHER CIVIL GROUPS AS WELL AS </p><p>PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN TO HIGHLIGHT MILOSEVIC\'S REPRESSIVE </p><p>TACTICS AGAINST MEDIA AND CRITICS. </p><p> </p><p>-- NOTE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF MEETINGS WITH LEADERS OF GREECE\'S </p><p>NEIGHBORS (ALBANIA, FYROM AND BULGARIA) AND PROSPECTS FOR GREATER </p><p>COOPERATION ARISING FROM THESE IMPROVED RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- SUGGEST INCREASED GREEK ROLE IN REGIONAL INITIATIVES SUCH AS </p><p>SECI (BUCHAREST ANTI-CRIME CENTER), STABILITY PACT (TABLE ONE ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS) AND SEDM. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) OVER THE HORIZON, PAPANDREOU AND TSOHATZOPOULOS WILL BE </p><p>LOOKING TO HEAR A BRIEF ARTICULATION OF YOUR VIEWS ON THE U.S.- </p><p>GREECE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  WE SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THE ANNUAL BILATERAL CONSULATIONS BEGUN </p><p>BY A/S GROSSMAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- SEEK COMMITMENT FOR MORE FREQUENT VISITS AT DAS LEVEL TO </p><p>FOLLOW-UP ON POLICY INITIATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>-- ENCOURAGE GREEKS TO ADD SUBSTANCE TO, DEFEND, AND PROMOTE THE </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>-- NOTE UPCOMING REPORTS (NEXT WEEK) ON IPR AND TERRORISM; GREECE </p><p>NEEDS TO RESOLVE THE WTO IPR CASE AND MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS </p><p>ON COUNTER-TERRORISM TO MOVE OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP FORWARD. </p><p>A COUNTER-TERRORISM BREAKTHROUGH IS IMPORTANT FOR AMERICANS\' </p><p>SECURITY IN GREECE. </p><p> </p><p>-- STRESS NEED TO NAIL DOWN DECISION ON F-16 ENGINES; PUSH FOR </p><p>GREEK DECISION TO PURCHASE U.S. M1-A2 TANKS - THE BEST IN THE </p><p>WORLD (WITH TSOHATZOPOULOS ONLY). </p><p> </p><p>-- SUPPORT CONTINUED GREEK RISK-TAKING TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH </p><p>TURKEY AND REACH POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ON CYPRUS.  STRESS </p><p>WILLINGNESS OF U.S. TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS </p><p>POSSIBLE.  EMPHASIZE THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH ANKARA FOR A </p><p>CONCRETE TURKISH STEP TO IMPROVE GREEK-TURKEY RELATIONS AND PUSH </p><p>FORWARD CYPRUS TALKS. </p><p> </p><p>-- ENCOURAGE GREECE TO FACILITATE FULL TURKISH PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>NATO EXERCISE "DYNAMIC MIX;"  WOULD REBOUND TO GREECE\'S CREDIT. </p><p> </p><p>-- PREVIEW OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED BY PAPANDREOU-CEM-ALBRIGHT </p><p>MEETINGS IN TWO WEEKS IN NEW YORK TO MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS ON </p><p>GREECE-TURKEY-CYPRUS ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>BURNS </p><p></p></div>
