REASONS: </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION MDC LEADERSHIP ARE </p><p>MORE COMFORTABLE WITH PRESIDENT OBASANJO\'S EFFORTS TO FACILITATE </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH ZANU-PF THAN WITH PRESIDENT MBEKI\'S.  THE PARTY\'S </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL, WELSHMAN NCUBE, ADVISED THE USG AGAINST </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PRESSING PUBLICLY FOR A NEW ELECTION AT THIS STAGE, INSTEAD </p><p>ENCOURAGING US TO PUSH SOUTH AFRICA AND NIGERIA TO TAKE THE </p><p>PUBLIC LEAD ON THIS ISSUE.  NCUBE DESCRIBED THE PARTY\'S </p><p>INTERACTIONS WITH THE CANADIAN COMPANY AT THE CENTER OF THE </p><p>ALLEGED ASSASSINATION PLOT AGAINST PRESIDENT MUGABE.  DANGER </p><p>SIGNS OF A SETUP WERE EVIDENT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE COMPANY\'S </p><p>APPROACH TO THE MDC, AND THE PARTY\'S FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE THOSE </p><p>AT THE TIME REVEALS A SURPRISING POLITICAL NAIVETE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF, </p><p>MET AT HIS RESIDENCE ON MARCH 22 WITH MDC SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p>WELSHMAN NCUBE.  NCUBE WAS JOINED BY THE MDC\'S SHADOW FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER AND MP TENDAI BITI. </p><p> </p><p>TALKS WITH MBEKI, OBASANJO </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WE ASKED TENDAI BITI, WHO HAD PARTICIPATED IN MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S POST-ELECTION TALKS ON MARCH 18 WITH PRESIDENTS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00786  01 OF 02  261323Z </p><p>MBEKI AND OBASANJO (REF B), FOR HIS IMPRESSIONS OF THOSE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  BITI APPROVINGLY DESCRIBED OBASANJO AS A CONSUMMATE </p><p>BRIDGE-BUILDER WHO DID AN IMPRESSIVE JOB OF BREAKING THE ICE IN A </p><p>MEETING WHICH WAS AWKWARD AT FIRST.  HE THOUGHT MUCH LESS OF </p><p>PRESIDENT MBEKI, WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS A "COLD, CALCULATING </p><p>POLITICIAN."  BITI CONFIRMED THAT THE TWO PRESIDENTS DID NOT </p><p>PRESS FOR A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY AS THE WAY FORWARD BUT </p><p>DID ENCOURAGE AN MDC-ZANU-PF DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) NCUBE NOTED THAT THE FACILITATORS NAMED BY MBEKI AND </p><p>OBASANJO -- ANC SECRETARY-GENERAL KGALEMA MOTHANTHE AND NIGERIAN </p><p>ACADEMIC PROFESSOR ADBEYO ADEDEJI -- HAD ARRIVED IN ZIMBABWE AND </p><p>WERE CURRENTLY TOUCHING BASE WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF BOTH PARTIES. </p><p>THE MDC HAD SHARED ITS NEGOTIATING PRINCIPLES WITH THE </p><p>FACILITATORS AND WOULD WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE OTHER SIDE CAME UP </p><p>WITH.  ASKED WHETHER THE FACILITATORS WERE FAIR BROKERS, NCUBE </p><p>SAID HE DID NOT KNOW THE NIGERIAN BUT HAD HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT </p><p>HIM.  IT WAS TOO EARLY TO TELL, HE SAID, WHETHER THE ANC </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL WOULD PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE.  HE WAS PLEASED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THAT MOTHANTHE HAD STATED HIS OBJECTIVE AS PROMOTING SUFFICIENT </p><p>RECONCILIATION TO HAVE A UNITY GOVERNMENT BEFORE AND AGAIN AFTER </p><p>NEW ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>WAY FORWARD: NEW ELECTION? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ASKED WHAT THE MDC\'S CURRENT OBJECTIVES WERE, BITI SAID </p><p>HE SUPPORTED FORMATION OF AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT, THEN DRAFTING OF </p><p>A NEW CONSTITUTION WHICH WOULD GOVERN NEW ELECTIONS.  BITI </p><p>INSISTED THAT THE CONSTITUTION-DRAFTING PROCESS WOULD NOT TAKE </p><p>LONG, AS SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL HAD BEEN GLEANED SINCE THE MOVE FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00786  01 OF 02  261323Z </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM BEGAN IN 1999.  NCUBE ADDED THAT KEY </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE PARTY LEADERSHIP WOULD BE GATHERING AT A RETREAT </p><p>NEAR BULAWAYO OVER THE WEEKEND TO STRATEGIZE ON NEXT STEPS. </p><p>(COMMENT: HEAVY SURVEILLANCE BY POLICE AND CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZATION AGENTS OF THE PLANNED VENUE IN THE MATOBO HILLS </p><p>TOURIST AREA FORCED PARTICIPANTS TO RECONVENE IN BULAWAYO.  WE </p><p>WILL BE SEEKING A READOUT OF THE LEADERSHIP\'S DISCUSSIONS.  END </p><p>COMMENT.)  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHETHER IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR </p><p>THE UNITED STATES TO PRESS PUBLICLY FOR A NEW ELECTION.  NCUBE </p><p>SAID SUCH AN APPROACH AT THIS EARLY STAGE WOULD BE </p><p>COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, PLAYING INTO MUGABE\'S EFFORTS TO DEMONIZE THE </p><p>WEST.  HE ADVISED US TO ENCOURAGE SOUTH AFRICA AND NIGERIA </p><p>QUIETLY TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS ISSUE.   ASKED WHETHER THE MDC </p><p>HAD IN PLACE A PLAN IN CASE ITS LEADERSHIP WAS ARRESTED, NCUBE </p><p>SAID THE SIMPLE ANSWER WAS "NO, WE HAVE NO PLAN B TO DEAL WITH </p><p>SUCH A SCENARIO." </p><p> </p><p>DICKENS AND MADSON SAGA </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.

NCUBE TOLD US THAT THE COMPANY AT THE CENTER </p><p>OF THE ALLEGED PLOT, DICKENS AND MADSON, HAD HIRED RUPERT </p><p>JOHNSON, A LONG-TIME FRIEND OF GASELA\'S, TO MAKE THE INITIAL </p><p>PITCH TO THE MDC.  ACCORDING TO NCUBE, JOHNSON WAS AN UNWITTING </p><p>PAWN IN THE WHOLE AFFAIR -- HE WAS RECRUITED TO WORK IN DICKENS </p><p>AND MADSON SOME MONTHS EARLIER; IT TURNS OUT ONLY TO SET UP </p><p>TSVANGIRAI AND HE HAS SINCE BEEN DISMISSED BY THE COMPANY. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ACCORDING TO NCUBE, DICKENS AND MADSON HAD APPROACHED THE </p><p>MDC WITH AN OFFER TO REPRESENT THE PARTY IN THE UNITED STATES AND </p><p>CANADA.  THE COMPANY CLAIMED TO HAVE EXCELLENT CONNECTIONS AT THE </p><p>VERY HIGHEST LEVELS OF THOSE GOVERNMENTS.  DICKENS AND MADSON </p><p>CLAIMED FURTHER TO HAVE RAISED MONEY FROM DISGRUNTLED ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>LIVING ABROAD AND SAID IT WOULD SIMPLY DEDUCT ITS LOBBYING FEES </p><p>OUT OF THESE FUNDS.  THE MDC ONLY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TRANSFER A </p><p>SMALL SUM OF MONEY TO THE COMPANY, AS THEY WERE TOLD PROOF OF </p><p>SUCH A TRANSFER MUST BE PRESENTED WHEN A LOBBYING GROUP REGISTERS </p><p>IN THE UNITED STATES TO REPRESENT A FOREIGN ORGANIZATION.  IN A </p><p>PROPHETIC STATEMENT, THE MDC\'S TREASURER INITIALLY BALKED AT </p><p>MAKING THIS PAYMENT, COMMENTING THAT HE HOPED THE PARTY WOULD NOT </p><p>COME TO REGRET ITS ASSOCIATION WITH DICKENS AND MADSON. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) NCUBE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT, IN RETROSPECT, DANGER SIGNS </p><p>WERE EVIDENT FROM THE MOMENT DICKENS AND MADSON CONTACTED THE </p><p>PARTY.  THE MDC IGNORED THEM, HOWEVER, AND REFRAINED FROM </p><p>VERIFYING THE COMPANY\'S BONA FIDES AND THOSE OF ITS DIRECTOR, ARI </p><p>BEN-MENASHE, BECAUSE IT TRUSTED GASELA\'S LONGSTANDING PERSONAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH RUPERT JOHNSON.  NCUBE ADMITTED THAT THAT HAD </p><p>TURNED OUT TO BE A COLOSSAL MISTAKE. HE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00786  02 OF 02  261323Z </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT THE CHARGES WOULD NOT HOLD UP IN COURT AND RELISHED </p><p>THE PROSPECT OF CROSS-EXAMINING BEN-MENASHE.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>NOTED THAT THE USG HAD A GREAT DEAL OF DEROGATORY INFORMATION </p><p>ABOUT BEN-MENASHE, AND ENCOURAGED NCUBE IN FUTURE TO APPROACH US </p><p>WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT COMPANIES OR INDIVIDUALS CLAIMING TO HAVE </p><p>SENIOR CONNECTIONS WITHIN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) TENDAI BITI\'S PREFERENCE FOR A NEW ELECTION HELD ONLY </p><p>AFTER NATIONAL ENDORSEMENT OF A NEW CONSTITUTION IS NOT PARTY </p><p>POLICY.  MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS CALLED FOR A NEW ELECTION HELD </p><p>UNDER INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION, BUT THE PARTY HAS NOT DETERMINED </p><p>THAT A NEW CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE A PREREQUISITE FOR ANOTHER </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  WE SHARE FOR NOW NCUBE\'S VIEW THAT A </p><p>VISIBLE USG ROLE IN PUSHING FOR A NEW ELECTIONS COULD BE </p><p>COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AT THIS STAGE AND THAT WE SHOULD, INSTEAD, </p><p>ENCOURAGE THE SOUTH AFRICANS AND NIGERIANS TO TAKE THE LEAD ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE.  THE MDC DEMONSTRATED A SURPRISING POLITICAL NAIVETE </p><p>IN ITS HANDLING OF THE DICKENS AND MADSON AFFAIR, WHICH HAS </p><p>PROVIDED THE GOZ WITH A LEGAL EXCUSE -- NO MATTER HOW THIN -- TO </p><p>GO AFTER THE PARTY LEADERSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
