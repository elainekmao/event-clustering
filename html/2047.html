<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002560 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/08/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, EFIN, KCRM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS01: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED ON TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 170698 </p><p>     B. STATE 175419 </p><p>     C. STATE 170551 </p><p>     D. ABUJA 2521 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by PolCouns and </p><p>PolMilOff, called on NSA Aliyu Mohammed on October 8. Foreign </p><p>Minister, Sule Lamido, Kaduna Governor Makarfi, Adobe Obe, </p><p>Foreign Affairs advisor to President Obasanjo, and LTC Idris </p><p>also attended.  This message covers their conversation on </p><p>U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan and counter-terrorism, </p><p>including anti-money laundering efforts and the upcoming </p><p>bilateral law enforcement meeting.  Segments on Sudan, DRC </p><p>and Burundi are covered septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY CONTINUED: The NSA stated the GON would make a </p><p>supportive public statement on U.S. military actions the </p><p>afternoon of October 8 (which was done).  He took note of the </p><p>need for MLAT ratification and the urgent need to bolster </p><p>Nigeria\'s anti-money laundering legal regime. While </p><p>supportive of a change in venue for the bilateral law </p><p>enforcement meeting, the NSA stated the Minister of Justice </p><p>had the final word.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>Bin Laden and the U.S. Response </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) After summarizing his October 7 conversation with </p><p>President Obasanjo about the impending military strikes, the </p><p>Ambassador emphasized to the NSA that U.S. actions had been </p><p>and would continue to be measured.  Moreover, the action </p><p>against Taliban military targets were coupled with large </p><p>dollops of humanitarian support for the Afghani people. </p><p>Describing generally the information contained Ref A as </p><p>strong evidence of the complicity of Bin Laden and Al-Qa\'ida </p><p>in the September 11 infamy and previous attacks against the </p><p>U.S., the Ambassador stressed that the global reach of the </p><p>organization threatened all nations, including Nigeria.  NSA </p><p>Mohammed, noting that Bin Laden had struck in Africa before </p><p>he struck in America, stated that the GON took the threat </p><p>seriously.  Now that "the heat is on these groups," he was </p><p>concerned they would "melt into Africa" where the borders </p><p>were porous and the banking system lacked controls. President </p><p>Obasanjo was talking to other African Heads of State about </p><p>the need to improve their abilities to counter this threat, </p><p>Mohammed remarked. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador Jeter recalled that one of the September 11 </p><p>terrorists had apparently been in Nigeria.  The NSA responded </p><p>the Nigerian visa in the terrorist\'s passport was a forgery. </p><p>Noting that the passport also bore entry and exit stamps, the </p><p>Ambassador remarked that the question of why Nigerian travel </p><p>entries were in the passport at all needed to be answered. </p><p>Shifting the focus from the Ambassador\'s inquiry, the NSA </p><p>offered that the GON would make a statement endorsing the </p><p>U.S. military actions.  Thanking the NSA, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>urged that the statement explicitly tie our action to the </p><p>right to self-defense as contained in the UN Charter. </p><p>(COMMENT: Press reports on the statement do not mention </p><p>reference to the UN Charter.  Nonetheless, the statement is </p><p>supportive, reiterating that the U.S. is targeting </p><p>terrorists, not innocent Muslims.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==================================== </p><p>COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS IN NIGERIA </p><p>==================================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Discussing Nigeria\'s counter-terrorism apparatus, the </p><p>NSA explained that he chaired a weekly meeting of the Nigeria </p><p>Intelligence Agency, the State Security Service and the </p><p>Defense Intelligence Agency, the Special Nigerian "Task </p><p>Force" that has been mentioned in previous reporting. </p><p>Additionally, his office was developing a seminar for the </p><p>police, customs, immigration, and port officials to increase </p><p>awareness of the threat of terrorism.  A second seminar was </p><p>also being arranged to raise awareness of officials at the </p><p>local and state levels.  Separately, the President planned to </p><p>establish an interagency National Security Commission, but </p><p>this would be designed to handle internal security matters </p><p>only, such as preventing inter-communal conflicts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=========================== </p><p>FAFT - STILL NOT GETTING IT </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Remarking that preventing money laundering was </p><p>cardinal in the fight against terrorism, the Ambassador </p><p>pointed out that Nigeria, decertified by the FATF, was now on </p><p>a list of non-compliant countries (Ref C).  The current </p><p>money-laundering regime, which focused only on monies derived </p><p>from the narcotics trade, was insufficient to combat the </p><p>financial arm of terrorism.  The bank regulatory system was </p><p>weak and there was no way to track the funds flowing through </p><p>Nigeria,  Jeter noted.  Moreover, Nigeria had tarried in </p><p>responding to the FATF questionnaire.  Nigeria needed to move </p><p>decisively to cure these flaws in order to maintain its </p><p>position in the vanguard against terrorism, the Ambassador </p><p>asserted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Surprised the FATF questionnaire had not been </p><p>answered, the NSA promised to get the relevant departments to </p><p>quickly complete the task.  He also requested our help in </p><p>identifying the curative measures Abuja must take to overcome </p><p>the decertification.  The NSA rushed to mention that the </p><p>President\'s plan for an agency to deal with financial crimes </p><p>(the Financial Crimes Commission) was being vetted by the </p><p>Federal Executive Council (Cabinet) and then would be passed </p><p>to the National Assembly for approval.  The process should be </p><p>completed by year\'s end, Mohammed offered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In an attempt to save face, the NSA complained Nigeria </p><p>had thus far received "zero support from the U.S." to recover </p><p>the Abacha funds.  Ambassador Jeter responded that the </p><p>Embassy\'s LEGATT was working with his GON counterpart.  Now </p><p>that forensic documents had been shared with Washington, he </p><p>hoped progress would be visible soon.  However, Nigeria had </p><p>not ratified the 1989 MLAT, which the U.S. ratified in early </p><p>2001.  The MLAT would ease cooperation in this area, the </p><p>Ambassador contended.  The NSA, noting that the U.S. took </p><p>over 10 years to ratify the treaty, said, "Our Senate will do </p><p>it in three months." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================================= </p><p>BILATERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MEETING </p><p>================================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Explaining that the U.S. law enforcement community\'s </p><p>attention was focused on counter-terrorism, the Ambassador </p><p>told the NSA that the U.S. hoped to shift the venue for the </p><p>November bilateral law enforcement meeting to Washington. </p><p>The NSA stated that he understood but must remain officially </p><p>neutral as a venue change would have to be agreed to by the </p><p>Minister of Justice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) COMMENT: The GON continues to privately and publicly </p><p>support U.S. counter-terrorism efforts.  Recent events have </p><p>clearly focused the attention of this government on its own </p><p>needs to address this threat.  Inertia and lack of </p><p>communication and coordination between Ministries </p><p>notwithstanding, we will keep pressing and hope to see some </p><p>action from the GON, particularly on the money laundering </p><p>front.  Due to President Obasanjo\'s penchant for regional </p><p>initiatives, we expect that, through ECOWAS or an ad hoc </p><p>grouping of African nations, Obasanjo will push for a </p><p>political consensus to restrict the ability of terrorists to </p><p>operate in the sub-region.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
