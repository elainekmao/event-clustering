<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000965 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Department for D (Gastright), INR/MR, I/RW, I/REC, SA </p><p>(Camp, Waller), SA/PD (Brennig, Irwin, Scensny), SSA/PAB, </p><p>SSO (pass to D) </p><p>Tokyo (Hara, Bryan) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY (JUNE 5):  TOKYO CONFERENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  In the run-up to the Tokyo conference, June 5 </p><p>coverage is apprehensive.  Will the LTTE go to Tokyo?  Will </p><p>the conference, donor contributions, and the peace process </p><p>itself be adversely affected if the Tigers aren\'t there? </p><p>Headlines are anxious.  Vernacular editorialists are silent </p><p>on the issue, but one English daily dilates on a recent </p><p>survey suggesting that 86 percent of the Sri Lankan public </p><p>supports "a negotiated settlement."  So what?  "It is </p><p>incumbent on everyone," says the editorialist, "to stand up </p><p>and be counted.  Civic organizations everywhere need to </p><p>channel the people\'s energies ... lest the spoilers of </p><p>peace wrest the initiative in moves to charter the future." </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>2.  Headlines. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>DAILY MIRROR (independent English daily) is pessimistic, </p><p>saying "LTTE again rejects PM\'s plan, but ready for talks" </p><p>and "Tigers refuse to budge." </p><p> </p><p>DAILY NEWS (government-owned English daily) quotes a chief </p><p>GSL negotiator, G. L. Peiris:  "Resumption of direct talks </p><p>[is] vital for compromise." </p><p> </p><p>DINAMINA (government-owned Sinhala daily) wants it both </p><p>ways.  "Donations would not be affected even if LTTE does </p><p>not come to Tokyo," it reports, then proceeds to quote "EU </p><p>special delegates" as saying:  "LTTE participation in </p><p>Confab is extremely vital." </p><p> </p><p>LANKADEEPA (independent Sinhala daily) simply reports: </p><p>"Prime Minister leaves for Tokyo Conference Tomorrow ... </p><p>will lead Sri Lanka Government delegation...." </p><p> </p><p>SUDAR OLI (independent Tamil daily) has Peiris holding a </p><p>plum to the north and east:  "Aid received at Tokyo </p><p>Conference is also for North and East with Tigers\' </p><p>initiative - Minister G. L. Peiris" </p><p> </p><p>Both THINAKARAN (government-owned Tamil daily) and </p><p>THINAKKURAL (independent Tamil daily) have LTTE leader S. </p><p>P. Tamilselvan saying that the LTTE is "prepared to go to </p><p>Tokyo ... if assurances are given through Norway regarding </p><p>Interim Administration...." </p><p> </p><p>And VIRAKESARI (independent Tamil daily) leads with </p><p>another, but more enigmatic, statement from Tamilselvan: </p><p>"Tigers have not completely rejected participation in the </p><p>Tokyo Conference." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>3.  Editorials </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>Under the headline "How the people could help out" the </p><p>DAILY NEWS (government-owned English daily) commented: </p><p> </p><p>Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>One thing which continues to provide hope for the future is </p><p>the substantial public backing for "peace by peaceful </p><p>means"....  According to the ... latest survey, public </p><p>support for a negotiated settlement of the ethnic conflict </p><p>stands at an encouraging 86 percent, indicating that the </p><p>majority of Lankans is continuing to be solidly behind the </p><p>current peace endeavor.... </p><p> </p><p>The need ... is great for a profound awakening of the </p><p>public conscience, covering North, South, East and West. </p><p>It is incumbent on everyone ... to stand up and be counted. </p><p>Civic organizations everywhere need to channel the people\'s </p><p>energies for beneficial, purposive change, lest the </p><p>spoilers of peace wrest the initiative in moves to charter </p><p>the future. </p><p> </p><p>Close excerpts. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>4.  Radio/Television </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>Radio and television newscasts report only that a "top- </p><p>level delegation" will represent Sri Lanka in Tokyo.  As </p><p>MTV (independent English telecaster) puts it:  "Heading the </p><p>top-level delegation will be Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremasinghe.  The delegation consists of Finance </p><p>Minister Choksy, Economic Reforms Minister Milinda </p><p>Moragoda, leader of SLMC Rauf Hakeem, and G. L. Peiris." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>5.
