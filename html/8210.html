REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Over the past month, the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) has </p><p>been conducting a series of one-week civil affairs programs </p><p>in 25 Maoist-affected districts in the east and mid-west of </p><p>the country.  While most of the programs so far feature </p><p>mobile medical clinics, in some areas the RNA has carried out </p><p>limited infrastructure development as well.  Local civilian </p><p>government authorities are participating in the programs, </p><p>according to the RNA.  The RNA has also begun conducting its </p><p>own "cultural" programs, focusing on themes of peace and </p><p>development, to counter the Maoists\' extensive rural </p><p>propaganda network.  The purpose of the campaign, says the </p><p>RNA\'s Director of Military Intelligence, is to reassert a </p><p>government presence in areas where civil authority has been </p><p>eroded by the Maoist presence.  The RNA reports that the </p><p>programs have so far been well received by the local </p><p>population--and even, in some areas, by local Maoist </p><p>cadres--and hopes to expand them to cover all 75 districts. </p><p>The apparent success may have been one factor underlying the </p><p>Maoist negotiators\' May 9 demand that the RNA not venture </p><p>farther than 5 km from their bases.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>CEASEFIRE BRINGS RENEWED HEARTS-AND-MINDS PUSH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Since the January 29 announcement of a ceasefire </p><p>between the Government of Nepal (GON) and Maoist insurgents, </p><p>the Maoists have mounted a vigorous campaign to recapture </p><p>some of the initial public good will and support they </p><p>squandered by breaking off negotiations and increasing </p><p>violence in late 2001.  Reports from the field--including </p><p>from emboffs who have traveled recently to outlying districts </p><p>(Refs B-E)--indicate that the Maoists are attempting to </p><p>rebuild their diminished popular support by holding </p><p>round-table meetings with local mainstream party officials, </p><p>staging "cultural" programs that feature revolutionary </p><p>song-and-dance spectacles, helping local farmers with the </p><p>harvest and even undertaking some minor development work, </p><p>such as repairing roads and footpaths.  While the Maoists are </p><p>actively and openly campaigning for hearts and minds in areas </p><p>where they have an established presence, they reportedly are </p><p>denying the same freedom of movement to representatives of </p><p>mainstream political parties and to GON officials.  According </p><p>to an official at the Ministry of Local Development, in </p><p>several districts the Maoists continue to interdict any and </p><p>all local government activities from taking place outside of </p><p>the district headquarters (septel). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) According to Brig. Gen. Dilip Rayamajhi, Director of </p><p>Military Intelligence (DMI), the leadership in the Royal </p><p>Nepal Army (RNA) saw the ceasefire as an opportunity for a </p><p>civil affairs campaign to regain public confidence in the </p><p>GON\'s ability to provide services in Maoist-affected areas. </p><p>Despite the ceasefire, he noted, GON officials are </p><p>constrained by the lack of security and fiscal resources from </p><p>restoring disrupted services.  In the initial phases of the </p><p>program, the RNA can fill this gap by (a) providing scarce </p><p>manpower and even scarcer materials and (b) by providing a </p><p>security shield.  Rayamajhi said the RNA developed the plan </p><p>internally and then disseminated it to local commanders, </p><p>ordering them to coordinate its operation with local civilian </p><p>government authorities.  (Note:  He said that a copy of the </p><p>plan has been forwarded to the National Planning Commission, </p><p>with no response to date.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The campaign, which began in April, has so far been </p><p>conducted in communities in 25 districts (15 in the east and </p><p>10 in the Maoist heartland in the mid-west).  Company-sized </p><p>units are deployed into target communities for one week at a </p><p>time.  According to Rayamajhi, the local commander chooses </p><p>the community in consultation with local government </p><p>authorities, who accompany the RNA unit on its one-week </p><p>expedition to the field. So far, the programs have generally </p><p>focused on providing medical care, but other services, such </p><p>as infrastructure development or distribution of educational </p><p>materials, have also been performed.  Col. Victor Rana of the </p><p>Department of Military Operations provided the following </p><p>break-down of services given under the program so far: </p><p>--Medical assistance to 25,103 patients; </p><p>--Medical evacuation of 7 patients; </p><p>--One family planning camp established; </p><p>--Distribution of educational/recreational materials to 28 </p><p>schools; </p><p>--Distribution of food to 25 schools; </p><p>--Repair of 6 educational facilities; </p><p>--Distribution of construction materials to 6 communities; </p><p>--Seeds distributed to 1,586 families; </p><p>--Veterinary care provided to 5,583 animals; </p><p>--Citizenship services provided in 20 districts (through the </p><p>Chief District Officer); </p><p>--15 "Cultural" programs conducted; </p><p>--Two water pipes repaired; </p><p>--One bridge built; </p><p>--One small dam built. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>RESOURCES, WORK SHARED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The RNA has no special budget to conduct these </p><p>programs, Rayamajhi said, but is using existing resources, </p><p>supplies and manpower, supplemented by donations from the </p><p>local business community, NGOs, and/or occasional materials </p><p>or funding from the local government.  Rayamajhi depicted the </p><p>effort as a joint endeavor between the military and the </p><p>civilian authorities, stressing that district health posts </p><p>contribute medicines and doctors to the mobile medical </p><p>clinics, and that Local Development Officers and Chief </p><p>District Officers have assisted in other programs.  The </p><p>civilian police and Armed Police Force also participate.  The </p><p>RNA hires members of the local community to provide the labor </p><p>for their infrastructure development programs.  In some </p><p>districts, such as Baitadi and Darchula, Maoist cadres have </p><p>also turned out to assist in the RNA-sponsored development </p><p>work, while in other locations insurgents have turned up as </p><p>patients at the medical clinics.  Rayamajhi said the RNA </p><p>accepts all comers to these projects--even Maoists.  Rana </p><p>said the Maoists have not prevented the RNA from conducting </p><p>programs in any area.  (Note:  According to local news </p><p>reports, however, in some locations, like the eastern </p><p>district of Panchthaar, the Maoists have prevented local </p><p>residents from participating.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  As a companion piece to its civil affairs </p><p>operation, the RNA has also begun launching its own </p><p>"cultural" programs to counter the Maoists\' propaganda </p><p>campaign.  Featuring song and dance, the material is </p><p>apolitical, Rayamajhi said, focusing primarily on the themes </p><p>of "peace and development."  He reported an enthusiastic </p><p>local response to the programs. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>BENEFITS/DISADVANTAGES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Rana said the RNA hopes eventually to expand its </p><p>civil affairs programs to all 75 districts.  He cited </p><p>positive media coverage and high local attendance </p><p>rates--despite Maoist threats--as key measures of the </p><p>successs of the campaign.  The program has enhanced good </p><p>relations between the security forces and their civilian </p><p>counterparts at the local level, improved the Army\'s image, </p><p>and promoted popular confidence in the GON\'s ability to </p><p>provide service and security, while increasing the RNA\'s </p><p>ability to gather intelligence in certain areas.  The major </p><p>drawback, in Rayamajhi\'s view, is the GON\'s inability to </p><p>continue the programs.  At the conclusion of each one-week </p><p>program, the local development officials typically retire to </p><p>the relative safety of the district headquarters, unable and </p><p>unwilling to venture into Maoist-dominated territory without </p><p>the security provided by the RNA, leaving the communities to </p><p>lapse back into neglect and isolation. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The ceasefire offers an opportunity, at least </p><p>temporarily, for the GON to resume basic services in areas </p><p>long neglected as a result of the insurgency.  In some areas, </p><p>however, the Maoists continue to deny GON officials entry and </p><p>to threaten and intimidate them (septel), making it virtually </p><p>impossible to re-establish a civilian goverment presence. </p><p>The effectiveness of the program in countering the Maoists\' </p><p>appeal may be indicated by local guerrillas warning </p><p>(unsuccessfully) the roving medical teams away from some </p><p>villages and by the persistent efforts of Maoist negotiators </p><p>to gain GON agreement to restrict the movement of army </p><p>personnel in the countryside (Ref A).  While some RNA </p><p>officers in the past have expressed disdain for the GON\'s </p><p>inability to provide services in outlying areas, Rayamajhi </p><p>and Rana seemed genuinely sympathetic to the financial, </p><p>security and staffing constraints their civilian counterparts </p><p>face in the field.  In the short term, we see little </p><p>likelihood that either civilian staffing or budgets will be </p><p>beefed up as long as security--and the outcome of the peace </p><p>talks--remain uncertain.  The RNA\'s civil affairs campaign </p><p>offers no permanent solution, but as long as it continues to </p><p>incorporate elements of the civilian government, it seems a </p><p>good interim first step. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
