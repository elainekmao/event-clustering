Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During a December 7 meeting with Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate provided a </p><p>tour d\'horizon of sub-regional issues, including Sierra </p><p>Leone, Liberia, and the upcoming ECOWAS Summit.  While noting </p><p>recent hiccups on disarmament, Kouyate was optimistic about </p><p>Sierra Leone.  He was less sanguine about reconciliation in </p><p>Liberia.  He expressed strong concern about Guinea-Bissau\'s </p><p>President Yala, and hoped to convene a mini-Summit on </p><p>Guinea-Bissau on the margins of the ECOWAS Summit in Dakar. </p><p>Kouyate stated that his initial concern about Wade\'s </p><p>ascension to the ECOWAS Chair had been allayed.  Other major </p><p>issues on the Summit agenda include terrorism, human </p><p>trafficking, and sub-regional harmonization.  His remarks on </p><p>his own future are reported septel (Ref D).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============ </p><p>SIERRA LEONE </p><p>============ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Kouyate expressed some concern about reports of </p><p>recalcitrance in carrying out disarmament in the diamond </p><p>producing areas; he ventured that the foot-dragging was born </p><p>of uncertainty.  If the RUF disarms, they have an uncertain </p><p>future.  Electoral prospects are nil because the RUF is </p><p>singularly unpopular.  Kouyate was unsure if the recent </p><p>hesitance was a major tear in the disarmament process or a </p><p>last-gasp attempt to wrench more assistance from the </p><p>international community before disarming (see also Ref B and </p><p>C).  Unsure of the magnitude of the foot-dragging, Kouyate </p><p>planned to speak with President Kabbah and SRSG Adeniji.  He </p><p>also noted some concern that, because of the intensified </p><p>fighting in Lofa County, Taylor might press the RUF to slow </p><p>down the DDR process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SPECIAL COURT: The temporal jurisdiction of the Court </p><p>had been discussed during his recent visit to New York, but </p><p>without resolution.  Kouyate was unconcerned about the delay, </p><p>believing it serendipitous.  He asserted that the disarmament </p><p>process should be completed before the Court starts its work. </p><p> Otherwise, the prospect of looming criminal prosecution </p><p>would cause many RUF combatants to balk at disarmament. </p><p>(COMMENT: Kouyate did not seem to be aware of the recent </p><p>decision by the GOSL, bringing closure to this issue.  END </p><p>COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) RUF LEADERSHIP: The RUF appeared to be fragmenting as </p><p>the peace process moved forward.  According to Kouyate, this </p><p>fragmentation was in some ways a good sign, although it </p><p>complicated dialogue with the RUF.  Issa Sessay, since he led </p><p>the largest group of fighters, was the most important person </p><p>in the hierarchy but seemed incapable of consolidating the </p><p>RUF.  Omre Golley had resigned his role as the spokesman, but </p><p>this was only a game to garner funds and attention, Kouyate </p><p>said.  As soon as money was dangled, Golley\'s ambition and </p><p>avarice would compel his return to the fold. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) RUF AND AL-QAIDA: Kouyate said ECOWAS simply did not </p><p>have the intelligence capabilities to investigate the </p><p>Washington Post article.  Guinea\'s Conte called the report </p><p>true, but Conte\'s response was visceral and not likely based </p><p>on fact, Kouyate chuckled.  The Post article probably would </p><p>be discussed at the Summit by Obasanjo, Kabbah, Konare and </p><p>Conte.  Kouyate asked the USG to share information on this </p><p>issue with ECOWAS; without it, there was little ECOWAS could </p><p>do.  He did note that if Ibrahim Bah were involved in illicit </p><p>transfers of diamonds, the center of the operation was </p><p>Ouagadougou. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>====================================== </p><p>LIBERIA - SANCTIONS AND RECONCILIATION </p><p>====================================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Kouyate recalled a recent meeting where President </p><p>Taylor had agreed to participate in an all-Liberia Conference </p><p>outside of the country.  The non-Liberia site was needed to </p><p>attract key Liberian political figures who had been charged </p><p>with treason by Taylor, including Ellen Sirleaf Johnson and </p><p>Alhaji Kromah, who were too uncomfortable to return home </p><p>despite the dismissal of the charges against them.  Taylor </p><p>agreed to free more political prisoners before the conference </p><p>began.  As a result, Kouyate had sent Taylor a missive </p><p>outlining a two-day conference.  The first day would be among </p><p>opposition parties, and the second day would involve </p><p>everyone, including Taylor, Konare and Obasanjo.  Only a few </p><p>days ago, Foreign Minister Monie Captan had called, saying </p><p>that Taylor, despite his earlier acquiescence, now furiously </p><p>objected to an all inclusive conference outside of Liberia </p><p>because it would give implicit recognition to those fighting </p><p>in Lofa County.  Captan was embarrassed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Liberians were tired of suffering because of Taylor\'s </p><p>venal leadership.  Kouyate added that fighting in Lofa County </p><p>was growing, with some of it not attributed to the LURD. </p><p>Clashes between the army and Taylor\'s Anti-Terrorism Unit </p><p>(ATU) had also intensified.  The army was incensed about </p><p>having to fend for itself, and not being paid, while the ATU </p><p>was relatively flush with money and equipment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) SANCTIONS: Kouyate stated that the Liberia sanctions </p><p>were having an effect.  First, Taylor did not like anything </p><p>that diminished his self-perception before other Heads of </p><p>State.  The psychological impact was telling.  Second, the </p><p>Liberian dollar had precipitously declined against its U.S. </p><p>counterpart.  Finally, the travel ban was having a </p><p>significant impact.  Most states were enforcing the measure, </p><p>Kouyate said.  Ghana was going a step further, even sending </p><p>back suspicious Liberians although their names were not on </p><p>the list. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============= </p><p>GUINEA-BISSAU </p><p>============= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Kouyate expressed strong concern about the situation </p><p>in Guinea-Bissau.  President Yala was becoming increasingly </p><p>erratic and irrational.  Yala had arrested numerous perceived </p><p>opponents in what appeared to be a contrived coup threat. </p><p>President Konare had sent an envoy to restore some balance, </p><p>but the emissary was rebuffed by Yala.  Wade and Obasanjo </p><p>were also concerned, and had offered to send envoys.  Kouyate </p><p>had asked Obasanjo and Konare, who had planned a "drop in" </p><p>visit on Yala, to wait.  He believed that a mini-Summit on </p><p>the margins of the ECOWAS Summit might provide a better forum </p><p>for a discussion, and appear less of a threat to Yala. </p><p>Kouayte underscored the need to calm Yala and harness </p><p>tensions in Guinea-Bissau -- lest the distemper spill into </p><p>Cassamance to everyone\'s chagrin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================================= </p><p>DAKAR SUMMIT DATES, TOPICS, AND OUTCOME </p><p>======================================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Kouyate explained the Summit schedule: the technical </p><p>level meetings would take place on December 15-16, followed </p><p>by the Ministerial on December 17.  Heads of State would </p><p>assemble on December 20-21.  In addition to sub-regional </p><p>security issues, the Summit would also address human </p><p>trafficking, further harmonization between ECOWAS and UEMOA, </p><p>and terrorism.  Ambassador Jeter passed the Executive </p><p>Secretary a list showing the implementation status of the </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>dozen major counter-terrorism conventions by all sub-regional </p><p>states.  Kouyate reviewed the document carefully, noting that </p><p>it would be a useful basis for discussions on terrorism at </p><p>the Summit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============================================= ==== </p><p>THE NEXT CHAIRMAN - NO LONGER AN UNGUIDED MISSILE </p><p>============================================= ==== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Kouyate acknowledged that Wade would take the ECOWAS </p><p>Chair.  Wade was selected despite initial apprehension by </p><p>some, including Kouyate himself.  Kouyate was convinced that </p><p>Wade could do well for ECOWAS.  Describing Wade as an </p><p>"unguided missile" at times, Kouyate explained that he had </p><p>recently met the Senegalese leader, who had not been </p><p>adequately informed of ECOWAS efforts towards regional </p><p>economic integration.  After briefing him privately for two </p><p>hours, Kouyate was no longer concerned that Wade would </p><p>short-change ECOWAS in favor of the West African Economic and </p><p>Monetary Union (UEMOA).  According to Kouyate, Wade\'s </p><p>reluctance to fully embrace ECOWAS was understandable in </p><p>part.  In ECOWAS, Senegal is not primus inter pares given the </p><p>presence of Nigeria and Ghana.  In UEMOA, Senegal is the </p><p>heavyweight.  "It is better to be the head of a cat than the </p><p>tail of a tiger," Kouyate quipped.  As long as the ECOWAS </p><p>Secretariat maintained close contact with Wade, Kouyate said, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>he would do fine.  In fact, Wade\'s leadership of ECOWAS may </p><p>be very timely.  Wade is singularly positioned to provide the </p><p>leadership that bridges the gap between ECOWAS and UEMOA and </p><p>to eliminate redundancy between the two organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Kouyate showed Jeter a Note from the Russian Embassy </p><p>requesting accreditation to ECOWAS for Russia\'s Ambassador to </p><p>Nigeria, and sought Ambassador Jeter\'s reaction.  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter thanked Kouyate, noting that the U.S. also hoped to </p><p>present its request for accreditation to ECOWAS in the very </p><p>near future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) COMMENT: Kouyate was open and relaxed, clearly close </p><p>to the end of his very successful tenure as ECOWAS Executive </p><p>Secretary.  As he heads off, Kouyate believes ECOWAS is </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>stronger now than when it was handed to him.  We agree. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: Now that the Konare-Kouyate duo is </p><p>preparing its exit from the ECOWAS epicenter, it will be </p><p>imperative to engage Wade and the new Executive Secretary -- </p><p>who will be selected at the Summit -- as early as possible. </p><p>The U.S. worked well with Konare and Kouyate and we got good </p><p>mileage from our efforts.  We must now seek an even stronger </p><p>relationship with those who are taking charge.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
