<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001004 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS, DS/OP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA </p><p>LONDON FOR REIDL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, PGOV, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL POLICE CLAIM VICTORY AGAINST MAOIST VALLEY </p><p>LEADERSHIP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Speaking before a group of Nepal Police officers at </p><p>an Embassy-sponsored presentation, police chief Rana claimed </p><p>a victory over Maoist leadership in the Kathmandu Valley, </p><p>stating police efforts had netted the valley bureau leaders. </p><p>Afterwards, RSO queried Rana over the veracity of local press </p><p>reports that Krishna Sen, acting Maoist valley bureau chief, </p><p>had been arrested.  (Note: his predecessor was arrested </p><p>approximately one month ago in a joint army and police </p><p>action).  Rana confirmed the reports and added with pride </p><p>that it was his officers who had captured most of the valley </p><p>leadership over the last two months. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) COMMENT: If Rana\'s claim regarding the insurgent\'s </p><p>valley leadership is true, it is likely that lower level </p><p>cadre in Kathmandu will be ineffective in mounting any </p><p>coordinated campaign for the next several weeks (a period </p><p>that coincides with the anniversary of the palace killings </p><p>last year).  While this does not rule out isolated incidents </p><p>in the city, it is very welcome news. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
