(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA </p><p>FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Post does not believe that the proposed </p><p>listing of Pacha Wazir or Haji Wali Muhammad will </p><p>pose any difficulties for the UAEG.  However, we </p><p>are very concerned about the potential for a strong </p><p>negative reaction from the UAEG with regard to </p><p>Human Appeal International.  Human Appeal, based in </p><p>Ajman, is one of the largest charitable </p><p>institutions in the UAE and is closely associated </p><p>(and operates under the patronage of) the ruling </p><p>family of Ajman Emirate.  Any public listing of </p><p>Human Appeal as a terrorist financing entity will </p><p>create serious difficulties for the UAE Government </p><p>and could result -- at minimum -- in a substantial </p><p>reduction in our heretofore stellar partnership </p><p>with the UAE on terrorist financing issues. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  We are aware that Human Appeal in the </p><p>past provided assistance to certain Chechen </p><p>organizations subsequently deemed to be </p><p>inappropriate by the USG.  We took that matter to </p><p>the UAE authorities and they promptly took action, </p><p>promising that these activities would cease.  We </p><p>are also aware of allegations by Bosnian officials </p><p>with regard to the operations of the Bosnia office </p><p>of Human Appeal.  However, we have not seen any </p><p>evidence to suggest that Human Appeal as an </p><p>organization is male fide or deliberately and </p><p>primarily involved in terrorist financing; if there </p><p>is such evidence we would like to see it.  Should </p><p>such evidence exist and be compelling, we would </p><p>still argue that, as in the past here, the UAE </p><p>authorities would no doubt strongly prefer to act </p><p>against the organization themselves -- forcefully, </p><p>but quietly -- upon the presentation of our case. </p><p>But to publicly embarrass such a prominent </p><p>organization, and one with close connections to the </p><p>rulers of Ajman, by publicly designating it would </p><p>be an affront which Emirati authorities could not </p><p>accept. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  We would note that, subsequent to the </p><p>9/11 attacks, the Emirate of Dubai established a </p><p>council tasked with vetting the activities of all </p><p>the various charitable organizations based in the </p><p>northern Emirates.  We have also been told that </p><p>overseas transfers of funds by UAE-based charities </p><p>are now closely scrutinized and that the boards of </p><p>directors of charities have been subjected to </p><p>background checks by the UAE\'s State Security </p><p>Department.  Clearly, Emirati officials are well </p><p>aware of the importance of preventing the misuse of </p><p>charitable funds by terrorists and terrorist </p><p>financers.  We suggest Human Appeal be dropped </p><p>entirely from consideration for designation. </p><p>However, should the Terrorist Financing PCC believe </p><p>there to be a compelling, documentable case against </p><p>Human Appeal, we believe a private approach to the </p><p>UAEG will likely prove far more effective than </p><p>public designation -- and will reflect the spirit </p><p>of our ongoing cooperation on terrorist financing </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
