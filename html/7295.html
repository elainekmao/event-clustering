<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000660 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: A SWING THROUGH THE NORTHWEST </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (B & </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Poloff completed a pre-election trip toigeria\'s </p><p>northeast region, the home of incumbent Vice President </p><p>Atiku Abubakar and a key to President Obasanjo\'s re- </p><p>election bidPoloff found crumbling infrastructure, </p><p>pessimism about the elections and worried Obasanjo-Atiku </p><p>campaign officials.  Political violence has occurred in the </p><p>area, with the worst conflicts in Adamawa.  INEC\'s pre- </p><p>election groundwork was minimal; the sense was that the </p><p>elections would produce an Obasanjo victory, whether he </p><p>actually won or not. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ADAMAWA </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Adamawa State, the home of Vice-President Atiku </p><p>Abubakar, is an important electoral battleground.  The </p><p>incumbent governor, Boni Haruna, facing his first ever </p><p>election, might lose.  (NOTE:  Haruna assumed the </p><p>governor\'s office when Atiku vacated it after being </p><p>selected as Obasanjo\'s running mate.  END NOTE.)  Most </p><p>local observers rank Atiku\'s election in 1999 as suspect, </p><p>with his victory the result of manipulating the vote count. </p><p>The man he beat, Bala Takaya, is the AD candidate this </p><p>time.  The ANPP candidate is an established, somewhat </p><p>popular politician, Adamu Mu\'azu Modibbo.  Adding to Boni\'s </p><p>difficulties, Bala hails from the same hometown.  But </p><p>Boni\'s heaviest baggage has been his non-performance. </p><p>Roads are decaying, electrical and water supplies are </p><p>sporadic; the state government has been remiss in paying </p><p>salaries on time.  The state paid two months of arrears to </p><p>pensioners and bureaucrats last week, leaving them only six </p><p>months behind.  The roads are so bad, according to one PDP </p><p>member, that Haruna and the Vice President took a </p><p>helicopter to a town about 150 km. away from the capital </p><p>last week to "avoid pieces of the road being tossed at </p><p>them" by residents along the route. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BAUCHI </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ANPP presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari and </p><p>current Vice-President Atiku held campaign rallies in </p><p>Bauchi in the past week.  Buhari attracted thousands of </p><p>supporters on arrival at the local airport.  According to </p><p>one man who attended the rally, Buhari was late due to the </p><p>throng blocking the route from the airport to the stadium, </p><p>a scene allegedly repeated at most Buhari campaign </p><p>whistlestops throughout the north and northern middlebelt. </p><p>In contrast, members of Atiku\'s campaign entourage </p><p>complained to Poloff that the Obasanjo-Atiku ticket was a </p><p>hard sell.  "We have to pay local government chairmen to </p><p>hire busloads of people to attend rallies," one lamented. </p><p>Further, Bauchi\'s traditional rulers refused to attend the </p><p>Atiku rally, declining due to "illness."  The PDP governor </p><p>of Bauchi Mu\'azu faces serious opposition from an ANPP </p><p>candidate backed by the traditional rulers and the </p><p>conservative elements of the Bauchi communities.  His </p><p>detractors claim that he is an unpopular candidate who </p><p>"stole" the 1999 elections.  His supporters say he is </p><p>popular on the ground, and that the assets of incumbency </p><p>combined with a solid track record of community </p><p>achievements will allow him to prevail. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BORNO </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Buhari\'s rally in Maiduguri, capital of Borno </p><p>state, was one of the few Buhari events which gained some </p><p>media attention.  According to a PDP activist in Borno, the </p><p>stadium was overflowing and en route to the city, Buhari </p><p>was stopped by cheering reporters.  Incumbent Governor Mala </p><p>Kachalla, who jumped to the AD after losing the ANPP </p><p>nomination, faces a serious challenge by both the PDP and </p><p>ANPP candidates.  In spite of lapses in paying salaries and </p><p>neglect of the development of vast areas of the state, </p><p>traditional and conservative elements in Borno support him, </p><p>but that may not be enough to carry the day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOMBE </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  When Obasanjo arrived in Gombe for a campaign </p><p>appearance, he found a party in disarray.  According to a </p><p>PDP senator, virtually the entire PDP membership has moved </p><p>to the ANPP.  Both Buhari and Atiku appeared there, with </p><p>tales similar to those from Bauchi being repeated.  While </p><p>the state has a larger Christian population than some of </p><p>its neighbors, Buhari seems to transcend the religious </p><p>divide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>YOBE AND TARABA </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Yobe and Taraba states comprise the northern and </p><p>southern extremes of the Northeast.  In Yobe, the ANPP </p><p>holds the cards, with an incumbent governor and a </p><p>conservative populace.  PDP candidates complained of </p><p>harassment and attacks, but compared to other areas, these </p><p>are of minor scale.  In Taraba, where the religious divide </p><p>is most evident, Buhari received an outpouring of support </p><p>on his visits to the state.  The incumbent PDP governor is </p><p>increasingly isolated from the national party and is </p><p>vulnerable; however, opposition candidates are not very </p><p>attractive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMON THEMES </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Violence is present throughout the area, with the </p><p>worst conflicts occurring in Adamawa.  Most common are </p><p>localized clashes between PDP and ANPP supporters and </p><p>attacks on motorcades.  In Adamawa, the grandson of the </p><p>Vice-President\'s father-in-law was arrested on the orders </p><p>of the incumbent governor for alleged "anti-government </p><p>activities;" he was caught distributing ANPP posters in the </p><p>capital of Yola.  Throughout the region, INEC has yet to </p><p>complete preparations for displaying a voters list or a </p><p>candidates list.  While everyone assumes that the polling </p><p>places will be the same as the September registration </p><p>sites, much concern remains about last minute </p><p>substitutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT: Regardless of party, there is widespread </p><p>disenchantment with incumbent office holders at all levels. </p><p>However, most people believe election rigging is inherent </p><p>in the political culture and note manipulation will keep </p><p>far more incumbents in office than actually deserve to </p><p>return.  On the presidential election, Obasanjo and Atiku </p><p>might not attract the crowds that Buhari has, but they have </p><p>the assets of incumbency and some real support as well. </p><p>However, it appears that Buhari has captured the momentum </p><p>in this region and will carry it into election day.  This </p><p>represents a reversal of fortune from several months ago. </p><p>Immediately after the PDP and ANPP party conventions in </p><p>January, Obasanjo would likely have carried the region. </p><p>Now, a growing number of northeasterners believe that the </p><p>only way Obasanjo can take the region is by tampering with </p><p>the vote count. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
