<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002986 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL AND AF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEA FOR OFE -- TOM WADE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: ADDITIONAL NARCOTICS CERTIFICATION </p><p>NOTES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ABUJA 02865 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  In addition to reftel\'s report card, Post wishes </p><p>to provide the following information on Nigeria\'s drug </p><p>control efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Major Traffickers: The initial report card </p><p>submitted by Post (reftel) should be revised to show </p><p>that Nigeria has arrested and is prosecuting at least </p><p>one major trafficker.  In January 2002 NLDEA personnel </p><p>at MMIA arrested a Nigeria Airways flight attendant </p><p>and seized 1.7 kilograms of heroin.  An ensuing </p><p>investigation by the NDLEA led to the arrest on April </p><p>17, 2002 of Anthony Onyechesi, the trafficker </p><p>providing the heroin for this and other shipments to </p><p>the U.S.  The NDLEA also seized assets belonging to </p><p>this trafficker, including four vehicles.  DEA </p><p>confirms that Onyechesi is a significant trafficker. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The Nigerian and Filipino cocaine traffickers </p><p>arrested in connection with the August 27, 2001 </p><p>seizure of 60 kilograms of cocaine at Lagos\' Tin Can </p><p>Island Port, on October 25, 2002, were convicted on </p><p>all three criminal counts with which they were charged </p><p>and sentenced to nine years imprisonment.  They are </p><p>currently serving their terms in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Extraditions:  Attorney General Kanu Agabi is </p><p>committed to the successful extradition of Nigerian </p><p>fugitives to the U.S.  He has assigned the MOJ\'s most </p><p>experienced extradition prosecutor to the US cases and </p><p>has pledged to appear in court himself to argue the </p><p>extradition cases.  He has consulted the new Chief </p><p>Judge of the High Court, Rosaline Ukeje, for </p><p>assistance in assigning competent judges to hear the </p><p>U.S. extradition cases.  The MOJ has not established a </p><p>formal extradition unit, but this informal system of </p><p>giving U.S. extradition requests preferential </p><p>treatment shows promise and unprecedented commitment. </p><p>MOJ officials believe that the creation of a formal </p><p>unit is inappropriate at this time given the modest </p><p>workload of US extradition requests, though such a </p><p>unit could be created if the pace picks up. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The extradition case currently before the court -- </p><p>Daniel Oruhiu -- opened in early October under a </p><p>temporary judge who could not finish the case before </p><p>she went on leave.  Therefore, the case last week was </p><p>transferred back to the Chief Judge of the High Court, </p><p>who assigned it to the "High Court Annex #2" on </p><p>October 28, 2002.  The judge\'s name will be known </p><p>shortly and proceedings should commence shortly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Asset Forfeiture </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  The NDLEA Chairman recently submitted a proposal </p><p>to the President, asking that the NDLEA be allowed to </p><p>keep a percentage of the proceeds from drug </p><p>traffickers\' assets forfeited and auctioned off by the </p><p>NDLEA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  In the prosecution of the Nigerian and Filipino </p><p>traffickers associated with the August 27, 2001 </p><p>seizure of 60 kilograms of heroin (para 3), the court </p><p>ordered the forfeiture of 8.54 million naira </p><p>(approximately USD 67,250) in funds identified in two </p><p>Nigerian banks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Controlled Deliveries </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. DEA\'s Lagos Office clarifies that controlled </p><p>deliveries can only be initiated after a viable </p><p>opportunity of drug trafficking to Nigeria has been </p><p>identified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. The NDLEA in early October announced publicly that </p><p>it is investigating three major commercial banks for </p><p>laundering drug proceeds.   According to DEA, it is </p><p>working with the NDLEA on a joint investigation of </p><p>suspected money launderer (name to be supplied by </p><p>classified email). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Regional Narcotics Cooperation </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. The NDLEA has shown a strong commitment to greater </p><p>cooperation in the West African sub-region and </p><p>throughout the continent.  An extradition agreement </p><p>was inked with South Africa in October 2002, building </p><p>on a bilateral drug and crime control agreement forged </p><p>last year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. DEA reports that the NDLEA has been the catalyst </p><p>in the West African Joint Operation (WAJO) which </p><p>brought together drug enforcement personnel from the </p><p>entire sub-regional and led to the successful </p><p>execution of a coordinated surge operation at air- and </p><p>sea ports.  164 drug arrests were recorded during the </p><p>six weeks of this regional enforcement initiative. </p><p>This initial success is encouraging greater </p><p>cooperation in the sub-region, and useful, </p><p>collaborative links are being established among </p><p>counter-narcotics officials.  The NDLEA has also </p><p>increased cooperation with its neighbor Benin, with </p><p>DEA assistance.  In early October the NDLEA and </p><p>Beninese Police conducted a joint drug interdiction </p><p>operation at the busy Seme border land border crossing </p><p>between the two countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
