END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>2. (U) FORMOSA MAGAZINE\'S FIRST ISSUE APPEARED ON AUGUST </p><p>29, 1979 AND SOLD MORE THAN 110,000 COPIES. CIRCULATION </p><p>QUICKLY INCREASED AND BY THE THIRD ISSUE HAD REACHED </p><p>NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES. THE MAGAZINE\'S </p><p>KAOHSIUNG OFFICE OPENED ON SEPTEMBER 28. THE MAGAZINE\'S </p><p>EXPLODING CIRCULATION AND ITS FOCUS ON DEMOCRACY AND </p><p>TAIWANESE IDENTITY UNNERVED A KMT LEADERSHIP ALREADY </p><p>SHAKEN BY THE UNITED STATES\' DECEMBER 1978 DECISION TO </p><p>SWITCH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS FROM THE ROC TO THE PRC. </p><p>AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE DECISION BY THE MAGAZINE\'S </p><p>STAFF TO ORGANIZE A MARCH AND RALLY TO COINCIDE WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS DAY ON DECEMBER10 LED TO THE </p><p>VIOLENT CONFRONTATION WITH POLICE ND TROOPS FROM THE </p><p>TAIWAN GARRISON COMMAND, AND TO THE SUBSEQUENT CRACKDOWN. </p><p>THESE EVENTS LAUNCHED THE CAREERS OF MANY OF TODAY\'S DPP </p><p>LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>DECEMBER 9: THE KUSHAN INCIDENT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>3. (U) THE EVENT WHICH HELPED SPARK THE VIOLENCE OF </p><p>DECEMBER 10 WAS THE ARREST AND BEATING OF SEVERAL OF THE </p><p>MAGAZINE\'S STAFF WHO WERE PUBLICIZING THE NEXT DAY\'S </p><p>MARCH AND RALLY. SHORTLY AFTER DARK ON DECEMBER 9, </p><p>SEVERAL VOLUNTEERS ON THE STAFF, INCLUDING CURRENT DPP </p><p>LEGISLATOR DAI ZHEN-YAO, SET OFF IN SPEAKER TRUCKS FOR </p><p>KAOHSIUNG\'S KUSHAN DISTRICT. AS THE DRIVERS ENTERED A </p><p>NARROW STREET, THEY ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL LOCAL POLICE </p><p>OFFICERS WHO ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE TRUCKS BY LYING DOWN </p><p>ACROSS THE ROAD. AFTER A BRIEF STAND-OFF THE MAGAZINE </p><p>STAFF BODILY REMOVED THE POLICE FROM THE ROAD AND </p><p>CONTINUED ON THEIR ROUTE. A SHORT DISTANCE ON, THE ROAD </p><p>WAS BLOCKED FORE AND AFT BY POLICE VEHICLES AND POLICE </p><p>OFFICERS WHO BROKE ONE TRUCK\'S WINDSHIELD AND BEAT THE </p><p>DRIVER. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) IN THE FIGHT THAT FOLLOWED, TWO OF THE MAGAZINE </p><p>STAFF WERE ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO KUSHAN POLICE STATION. </p><p>WHEN WORD OF THE ARRESTS SPREAD, A CROWD OF SOME SIXTY </p><p>PEOPLE INCLUDING DPP ELDER AND FORMER PARTY CHAIRMAN SHIH </p><p>MING-TE (THEN THE MAGAZINE\'S GENERAL MANAGER), SURROUNDED </p><p>THE STATION AND DEMANDED THE RELEASE OF THE PRISONERS. </p><p>THE MOOD OF THE CROWD TURNED VIOLENT WHEN IT WAS LEARNED </p><p>THAT THE PRISONERS HAD BEEN DRAGGED UPSTAIRS BY THE FEET </p><p>AND THAT ONE HAD SUFFERED A CONCUSSION. ACCORDING TO </p><p>DAI, POLICE ARMED WITH RIFLES AND BAYONETS SURROUNDED THE </p><p>CROWD, WHICH HAD REFUSED ORDERS TO MOVE ON. THE TWO WERE </p><p>EVENTUALLY RELEASED AT ABOUT 2:00 AM AND THE CROWD </p><p>DISPERSED. THOUGH THERE WERE NO SERIOUS CONFRONTATIONS </p><p>WITH POLICE AT THE STATION, THE INCIDENT INCREASED </p><p>TENSIONS AND SET A CONFRONTATIONAL TONE FOR THE FOLLOWING </p><p>DAY. </p><p> </p><p>DECEMBER 10: THE KAOHSIUNG RIOT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>5. (SBU) THE DECEMBER 10 MARCH WAS TO HAVE BEGUN AND </p><p>ENDED AT KAOHSIUNG ROTARY PARK, TAKING A CIRCULAR ROUTE </p><p>PAST THE HSIN HSENG POLICE STATION. APPROXIMATELY SIX </p><p>HUNDRED MARCHERS SET OFF. ONLY TWO HUNDRED METERS INTO </p><p>THE MARCH, THE DEMONSTRATORS ENCOUNTERED A SOLID WALL OF </p><p>RIOT POLICE WHILE THE ROAD ON BOTH SIDES WAS OCCUPIED BY </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 400 LIUMANG ALLEGEDLY RECRUITED BY THEN </p><p>KAOHSIUNG MAYOR WU YU-YUN. ACCORDING TO SEVERAL OF OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS, THE TWO LEADERS OF THE GANGSTER ELEMENTS </p><p>WERE TSAI SUNG-HSIUNG, WHO IS NOW DEPUTY SPEAKER OF THE </p><p>KAOHSIUNG CITY COUNCIL, AND CHANG HSING-WU, WHO IS ALSO A </p><p>CITY COUNCILMAN. (NOTE: WU YU-YUN HAS CONSISTENTLY </p><p>DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT IN RECRUITING GANGSTERS TO DISRUPT </p><p>THE MARCH. END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) WHILE THE ENSUING SEQUENCE OF EVENTS IS NOT </p><p>ENTIRELY CLEAR, WITNESSES AND PARTICIPANTS AGREED THAT </p><p>THE GANGSTERS ACTED AS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS, ATTACKING </p><p>BOTH POLICE AND MARCHERS WITH BAMBOO POLES AND IRON RODS. </p><p>IN THE MELEE THAT ENSUED THE POLICE USED TEAR-GAS AND </p><p>RIOT STICKS TO BREAK UP THE MARCH. REPORTS OF INJURIES </p><p>RANGE FROM THE HUNDREDS TO MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND WITH </p><p>ONE DEMONSTRATOR LATER DYING OF HIS INJURIES. OVER THE </p><p>NEXT MONTH, MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARTICIPANTS </p><p>AND SYMPATHIZERS WERE ROUNDED UP. SHIH MING-TE AND SIX </p><p>OTHERS WERE TRIED IN MILITARY COURTS AND SENTENCED TO </p><p>PRISON TERMS OF BETWEEN TWELVE YEARS AND LIFE. SEVERAL </p><p>INTERVIEWEES TOLD US THAT ONLY PRESSURE FROM US </p><p>CONGRESSMEN AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS </p><p>PREVENTED SHIH MING-TE FROM BEING SENTENCED TO DEATH. </p><p>THIRTY-FOUR OTHERS WERE TRIED IN CIVILIAN COURTS AND </p><p>SENTENCED TO TERMS OF FOUR TO SIX YEARS. THE ARRESTS </p><p>EFFECTIVELY SILENCED THE OPPOSITION UNTIL ITS LEADERS </p><p>WERE PAROLED IN 1987. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) COMMENT: THE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE </p><p>MEILIDAO INCIDENT IS THAT IT WAS THE CRUCIBLE IN WHICH </p><p>THE CAREERS OF TODAY\'S OPPOSITION LEADERS WERE FORGED. </p><p>THE LIST OF THOSE ARRESTED AND JAILED IS A WHO\'S WHO OF </p><p>THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT. AMONG THEM ARE DPP VICE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ANNETTE LU (LU HSIU-LIEN), FORMER </p><p>DPP CHAIRMAN AND PARTY CO-FOUNDER SHIH MING-TE, CURRENT </p><p>DPP CHAIRMAN LIN YI-HSIUNG, DPP FOUNDING FATHER HUANG </p><p>HSIN-CHIEH, LEGISLATOR DAI ZHEN-YAO AND NATIONAL POLICY </p><p>ADVISOR CHOU PING-TE. OTHERS, INCLUDING DPP PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATE CHEN SHUI-BIEN AND KAOHSIUNG MAYOR FRANK HSIEH </p><p>(HSIEH CHANG-TING), GOT THEIR POLITICAL START AS </p><p>ATTORNEYS DEFENDING THE ARRESTED ACTIVISTS. ONE </p><p>COMMENTATOR SAID THAT HE BELIEVES THAT PRESSURE FROM THE </p><p>UNITED STATES ON KMT-RULED TAIWAN TO DEMOCRATIZE </p><p>INCREASED AFTER 1979 AND LED DIRECTLY TO THE END OF </p><p>MARTIAL LAW, THE END OF THE BAN ON POLITICAL PARTY </p><p>FORMATION AND THE END OF RESTRICTIONS ON THE PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) COMMENT (CONT.) OUR INTERLOCUTORS AGREED THAT </p><p>THE MELIDAO INCIDENT WAS THE TURNING POINT IN TAIWAN\'S </p><p>DEMOCRATIZATION. THE IDEOLOGICALLY FRACTURED TANG-WAI </p><p>WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A COHERENT POLITICAL PARTY CAPABLE </p><p>OF FORMING A VIABLE OPPOSITION. THE INCIDENT AND THE </p><p>OPEN TRIAL OF THE ACCUSED RAISED POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS </p><p>IN TAIWAN AND BROUGHT HOME THE VALUE OF DEMOCRACY. THIS </p><p>IN TURN LED THE ELECTORATE TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVISTS, </p><p>THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR DEFENSE TEAM AT THE BALLOT BOX </p><p>ENABLING MANY OF THEM TO BECOME ELECTED OFFICIALS AT ALL </p><p>LEVELS. TAIWANESE OVERSEAS ORGANIZED INDEPENDENCE </p><p>MOVEMENTS WHILE SCORES OF TAIWAN GRADUATE STUDENTS </p><p>ABANDONED THEIR STUDIES IN THE US, EUROPE, AND JAPAN TO </p><p>RETURN HOME AND JOIN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. THUS WERE </p><p>SET IN MOTION THE FORCES WHICH HAVE MADE TAIWAN A </p><p>VIBRANT, MULTIPARTY DEMOCRACY, AND PUT THE OPPOSITION DPP </p><p>IN THE POSITION OF MOUNTING A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO </p><p>CONTINUED KMT RULE IN THE MARCH, 2000 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>DUNN. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
