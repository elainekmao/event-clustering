<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000941 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PA/OBS/BS G. SANTULLI; INFO NEA/PPD C. </p><p>BOURGEOIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KPAO JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SUBJECT:  TV CO-OP PROPOSAL:  BILATERAL AND </p><p>REGIONAL ISSUES IN U.S.-JORDANIAN RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  Embassy Amman proposes a TV Co-op with a </p><p>three-person crew from Jordan Television, the </p><p>government-owned and sole local television station in </p><p>Jordan, to produce original news features in the </p><p>United States on the role of the Arab and Jordanian </p><p>community in the United States, with specific </p><p>attention paid to the role of women; issues related to </p><p>Jordanian students in the United States; and issues </p><p>related to implementation of the historic U.S.-Jordan </p><p>Free Trade Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Background:   At a time when great misperceptions </p><p>have emerged in the Arab world, including Jordan, </p><p>regarding the lives of Arabs and Muslims in the United </p><p>States, we see a great need for honest, in-depth </p><p>reporting from the source that will correct some of </p><p>those misperceptions.  Jordan is one of the U.S.\' </p><p>principal allies in the Arab world.  The U.S. and </p><p>Jordanian governments enjoy excellent relations on all </p><p>levels, and the relationship has begun to expand and </p><p>deepen with the entry into force in 2001 of a </p><p>bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  In addition, </p><p>according to figures from AMIDEAST, some 2000 </p><p>Jordanian students are resident in the United States </p><p>each year, a percentage of the total Arab student </p><p>population well above Jordan\'s size.   That said, </p><p>there remains, in particular in the wake of the </p><p>September 11 attacks in the U.S., an ignorance among </p><p>much of the Jordanian population about ordinary life </p><p>in America, and in particular among Jordanians and </p><p>other Arabs resident in the U.S.  Reports of wide- </p><p>spread harassment and even religious persecution </p><p>against Arabs and Muslims in the United States have </p><p>had great impact here, creating misperceptions that </p><p>are difficult to dispel through traditional PD </p><p>programs.  A TV-coop with Jordan TV, the country\'s </p><p>only local broadcast station, from which are produced </p><p>feature stories on the lives of Arabs and Muslims in </p><p>the U.S., in particular women; the experiences of </p><p>Jordanian students at U.S. colleges and universities; </p><p>and a focus on the growing U.S.-Jordan trade </p><p>relationship in the wake of passage of the FTA could </p><p>directly address for a wide audience some of these key </p><p>misperceptions. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Themes:  Jordan TV plans to focus on two themes. </p><p>The first theme involves the Arab and Muslim community </p><p>in the United States and its role in bridging the </p><p>widening gap between the Arab and Muslim world on one </p><p>hand and the West on the other.  Two sub-themes of </p><p>this topic are the role of Arab and Muslim women in </p><p>the U.S. and the experiences of Jordanian students </p><p>resident in the U.S.   The second theme involves the </p><p>growth of U.S.-Jordanian economic and trade relations, </p><p>a subject of major interest in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Theme Details: </p><p>a.  The Arab and Muslim Community in the United </p><p>States:  Jordan TV would like to focus on the life of </p><p>Arabs and Muslims in American society:  their life, </p><p>work and their impact on the American opinion of Arabs </p><p>and Muslims around the world.  A first sub-theme of </p><p>this topic is an exploration of the role of Arab and </p><p>Muslim women in the United States:  does it differ </p><p>from their role in traditional Arab or Muslim </p><p>societies? What are the stereotypes they are faced to </p><p>confront in American society, and have they had any </p><p>success in changing those stereotypes?    Jordan TV </p><p>would also like to focus on Jordanian students </p><p>resident in the United States:  their place in </p><p>American life as a bridge between two cultures and how </p><p>they portray their own society and causes/issues </p><p>important to them.   The underlying focus of these </p><p>topics will be how each of these groups (Arabs, women, </p><p>students) may  influence American society, or serve to </p><p>close the gap between Arab and American societies. </p><p> </p><p>b.  U.S.-Jordanian Economic Relations:  Jordan TV </p><p>would like to explore the impact in the United States </p><p>of the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, an issue of </p><p>great interest to Jordanians, but one rarely viewed </p><p>from a U.S. perspective.  Jordan is only the fourth </p><p>country to sign an FTA with the United States, and </p><p>trade ties between the two countries have only </p><p>recently emerged as a central issue.  The FTA is not </p><p>only a meaningful symbol of the importance attached by </p><p>the United States to its relationship with Jordan, but </p><p>is an increasingly important element to Jordan\'s </p><p>future economic development.  Jordan TV would like to </p><p>explore this issue and elucidate sectors and areas </p><p>where Jordan might do better in taking advantage of </p><p>this historic opportunity. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Logistics:  Jordan TV plans to send a three-person </p><p>crew to take part in the Co-op.  They will pay the </p><p>international airfare for this crew. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Broadcasting:  Jordan Television has committed to </p><p>airing these feature programs on its prime-time news </p><p>broadcasts, in addition to airing some of them on its </p><p>weekly "60 minutes" news feature program, Jordan\'s </p><p>most popular news-based show. </p><p> </p><p>7.
