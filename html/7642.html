(SBU) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  ALBERTA ENERGY </p><p>SECTOR LEADERS SUPPORT U.S. GOALS IN IRAQ, ARE VERY </p><p>PLEASED THE U.S. ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (EIA) </p><p>HAS BEGUN TO TREAT OIL SANDS AS PROVEN RESERVES AND ARE </p><p>CONCERNED THAT NORTH AMERICA IS BECOMING OVERLY RELIANT </p><p>ON NATURAL GAS FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>HARDLY SURPRISING IN U.S.-FRIENDLY ALBERTA, DURING </p><p>MEETINGS THE WEEK OF APRIL 7, CALGARY CG CHAVERA AND </p><p>EMBASSY ENERGY OFFICER ALL BUT HAD TO CUT OFF PRO- </p><p>WASHINGTON, ANTI-OTTAWA TIRADES BY BOTH PROVINCIAL </p><p>MINISTERS AND ENERGY EXECUTIVES, WHO NOT ONLY BROADLY </p><p>SUPPORT U.S. POLICY IN IRAQ, BUT EVEN MORE INTENSELY </p><p>RESENT THE FACT THAT "THEIR MINISTER" (FEDERAL NATURAL </p><p>RESOURCES MINISTER HERB DHALIWAL) CALLED THE PRESIDENT A </p><p>"FAILED STATESMAN" AND WAS NOT REBUKED BY PRIME MINISTER </p><p>CHRETIEN.  CG AND ENERGY OFFICER ASSURED THEM THAT WHILE </p><p>THE DISAPPOINTMENT AMBASSADOR CELLUCCI EXPRESSED WITH THE </p><p>GOC OVER IRAQ POLICY IS VERY REAL AND OUR DISMAY AT </p><p>DHALIWAL\'S STATEMENT IS DEEP, OUR FRUSTRATION HAS NOTHING </p><p>TO DO WITH OUR ENERGY RELATIONSHIP, WHICH WE VALUE </p><p>GREATLY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A NUMBER OF THESE SAME INTERLOCUTORS NOTED HOW </p><p>PLEASED THEY WERE BY EIA\'S NEW DATA SHOWING CANADA WITH </p><p>180 BILLION BARRELS OF TOTAL PROVEN RESERVES, SECOND ONLY </p><p>TO SAUDI ARABIA AND WELL AHEAD OF NUMBER THREE IRAQ.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME THEY RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT FUTURE PIPELINE </p><p>AND REFINERY CAPACITY FOR HEAVY CRUDE, ESPECIALLY AS OIL </p><p>SANDS OUTPUT NEARS ONE MILLION BARRELS PER DAY (BPD) AND </p><p>STARTS ON WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A 5-10 YEAR ROAD TO THE </p><p>SECOND MILLION.  WE ALSO HEARD GREAT ENTHUSIASM FOR </p><p>BRINGING THE ARCTIC GAS RESERVES OF CANADA\'S MACKENZIE </p><p>BASIN (FIRST) AND THEN ALASKA\'S PRUDHOE BAY TO MARKET, </p><p>COUPLED WITH CONCERN THAT EVEN THESE LARGE DEPOSITS WILL </p><p>ONLY HELP NORTH AMERICA TO KEEP TREADING WATER ON GAS </p><p>SUPPLIES AS WE BUILD MORE AND MORE GAS-FIRED GENERATION. </p><p>THE ALBERTA LEADERSHIP ALSO CONTINUES TO HAVE CLIMATE </p><p>CHANGE AND CANADA\'S KYOTO IMPLEMENTATION PLANS MUCH ON </p><p>ITS MINDS, BUT SEEMS NOW TO FEEL THAT THE "DAMAGE COMING </p><p>FROM OTTAWA" CAN BE MANAGED.  PROVINCIAL ENERGY MINISTER </p><p>MURRAY SMITH LOOKS FORWARD TO A PLANNED EARLY JUNE TRIP </p><p>TO WASHINGTON AT WHICH TIME HE HOPES TO MEET WITH U/S </p><p>LARSON AND A/S WAYNE.  WE RECOMMEND GRANTING SMITH AT </p><p>LEAST ONE OF THESE MEETINGS AS HE IS VERY WELL-INFORMED </p><p>AND INFLUENTIAL.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>OIL SANDS: GOOD NEWS AND FUTURE WORRIES </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) MINISTER SMITH, CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF </p><p>PETROLEUM PRODUCERS (CAPP) PRESIDENT PIERRE Alvarez_ AND </p><p>EXECUTIVES FROM BP AND PETROCANADA WERE UNITED IN </p><p>EXPRESSING PLEASURE AND APPRECIATE FOR U.S. EIA\'S RECENT </p><p>DECISION TO REFERENCE THE "OIL AND GAS JOURNAL\'S" </p><p>TREATMENT OF OIL SANDS AS "PROVEN RESERVES" ON THE ORDER </p><p>OF 175 BILLION BARRELS.  THEY HAILED THIS AS A BIG WIN </p><p>FOR THE OIL SANDS INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND AT LEAST A </p><p>SYMBOLIC VICTORY FOR NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY.  AT </p><p>THE SAME TIME, BP CANADA CEO TIM FAITHFUL AND OTHERS </p><p>NOTED THAT WITH MOST OIL SANDS PROJECTS RUNNING WELL OVER </p><p>BUDGET THAT THE INDUSTRY IS GOING THROUGH A TOUGH </p><p>DIGESTION PROBLEM AS IT APPROACHES ONE MILLION BPD IN </p><p>OUTPUT.  MINISTER SMITH, CAPP OFFICIALS AND FAITHFUL ALL </p><p>NOTED THAT THE STRAINS ON LABOR SUPPLIES WILL BECOME </p><p>GREATER IN THE NEXT FIVE OR TEN YEARS AS OIL SANDS OUTPUT </p><p>REACHES TWO MILLION BPD.  SOME ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN </p><p>THAT WITH NO NEW REFINERIES BUILT IN NORTH AMERICA IN </p><p>DECADES THAT OUR CAPACITY TO SHIP AND REFINE ALL THIS </p><p>HEAVY CRUDE WILL BE CHALLENGED.  SOME NOTED THAT WITH </p><p>MORE BLENDS OF EVER CLEANER GASOLINE REQUIRED, THAT </p><p>LOOKING STRATEGICALLY AT PIPELINE AND REFINING CAPACITY </p><p>WILL BE NEEDED FOR INCREASING OIL SANDS PRODUCTION IN THE </p><p>FUTURE, ESPECIALLY FURTHER OUT AS IT MOVES BEYOND TWO </p><p>MILLION BPD.  IN THEIR VIEW, COORDINATED </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL/AIR QUALITY POLICIES WILL BE INCREASINGLY </p><p>IMPORTANT AS WE DEAL WITH RISING OUTPUT AND USE OF HEAVY </p><p>CRUDE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) SMITH AND OTHERS ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT </p><p>THE USG IS AWARE THAT OVER TIME THERE WILL BE TREMENDOUS </p><p>ELECTRICITY CO-GENERATION AVAILABLE AS A RESULT OF THE </p><p>HUGE THERMAL NEEDS OF THE OIL SANDS REFINING PROCESS. </p><p>THIS COULD OVER TIME MAKE SIGNIFICANT NEW ELECTRICITY </p><p>EXPORTS AVAILABLE TO THE UNITED STATES, BUT AT LEAST FOR </p><p>NOW THERE IS LIMITED CAPACITY TO MOVE THIS WEST AND THEN </p><p>SOUTH THROUGH BRITISH COLUMBIA AND ON TO OUR PACIFIC </p><p>NORTHWEST.  THERE IS ALMOST NO CAPACITY TO MOVE IT SOUTH </p><p>INTO THE U.S. ROCKY MOUNTAIN STATES AND MARKETS FURTHER </p><p>AFIELD.  ALBERTANS SEE THIS AS A PROMISING ISSUE FOR </p><p>FUTURE PROVINCIAL-STATE, WASHINGTON-OTTAWA AND REGULATOR </p><p>TO REGULATOR COORDINATION. </p><p> </p><p>ARCTIC GAS IS GREAT, BUT WHERE IS THE REST? </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) AS ALWAYS, ALBERTANS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR ARE </p><p>FOLLOWING ARCTIC GAS DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING ON THE </p><p>LEGISLATIVE FRONT IN WASHINGTON, VERY CLOSELY.  THE </p><p>WIDELY HELD VIEW IN ALBERTA THAT THE SMALLER MACKENZIE </p><p>LINE WILL BEAT THE MAMMOTH PRUDHOE BAY PROJECT TO THE </p><p>PERMITTING PROCESS AND TO MARKET IS VIEWED AS GOOD NEWS </p><p>FOR CANADA AND FOR BILATERAL RELATIONS.  ALBERTA, AS A </p><p>TRANSIT POINT FOR ANY PRUDHOE BAY LINE, LOOKS FORWARD TO </p><p>SEEING THAT PROJECT BUILT AS WELL, BUT OFFICIALS SUCH AS </p><p>SMITH AND SENIOR INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES REMAIN CONCERNED </p><p>THAT WASHINGTON NOT APPROVE A FISCAL REGIME FOR PRUDHOE </p><p>BAY GAS THAT CREATES INVESTMENT DISINCENTIVES FOR OTHER </p><p>BASINS OR THAT ARTIFICIALLY CREATES A HUGE, SUDDEN JUMP </p><p>IN SUPPLY.  THE KEY TO MOLLIFYING AT LEAST CANADIAN </p><p>ENERGY ELITES IN ALBERTA SEEMS TO LIE IN FINDING A SET OF </p><p>FISCAL AND REGULATORY MEASURES FOR PRUDHOE BAY THAT D0ES </p><p>NOT APPEAR TO DEPART TOO SEVERELY FROM THOSE DEPLOYED </p><p>ELSEWHERE.  THUS, LOAN GUARANTEES AND ACCELERATED </p><p>DEPRECIATION SEEM ACCEPTABLE, WHILE AT LEAST LAST YEAR\'S </p><p>VERSION OF A PRICE FLOOR OR GUARANTEE CAUSES OFFENSE. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) AT THE SAME TIME AS THESE SOPHISTICATED </p><p>OBSERVERS WORRY ABOUT AN OVERLY-GENEROUS PRUDHOE REGIME </p><p>BRINGING TOO MUCH GAS ON-LINE TOO SUDDENLY AND WITH TOO </p><p>LITTLE RISK, THEY ALMOST ALL WORRY THAT NORTH AMERICA IS </p><p>BECOMING OVERLY RELIANT ON NATURAL GAS FOR ELECTRICITY </p><p>GENERATION.  MANY ARGUE THAT EVEN MACKENZIE PLUS PRUDHOE </p><p>BAY WOULD ONLY SUPPLY ABOUT ONE THIRD OF WHAT NORTH </p><p>AMERICA MUST REPLACE EVERY YEAR JUST TO TREAD WATER. </p><p>ELDER STATESMAN AND GAS EXPERT JIM GRAY, IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>JUST DOES NOT SEE WHERE ALL THE GAS WILL COME FROM FOR </p><p>OUR INCREASINGLY GAS-DRIVEN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY GROWTH. </p><p>AND ON ARCTIC GAS, HE VARIES FROM THE CROWD IN BELIEVING </p><p>THAT LNG IS MORE ECONOMIC THAN PRUDHOE BAY AND WONDERS IF </p><p>WE WILL NOT MOVE TO LNG AND GAS AS A "GLOBAL COMMODITY" </p><p>LONG BEFORE A PRUDHOE BAY LINE IS BUILT.  MINISTER SMITH </p><p>IS CONCERNED THAT BY THE TIME THE U.S. IS IN FULL </p><p>ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT INADEQUATE GAS SUPPLIES COULD </p><p>CHOKE OFF GROWTH, WHICH HE NOTES IS JUST WHAT THE VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S 2002 REPORT WARNED ABOUT AND CALLED FOR </p><p>MEASURES TO AVOID.  TRANSCANADA PIPELINE SENIOR VP ROBERT </p><p>DAY THINKS GAS DEMAND WILL SO OUTSTRIP SUPPLY FROM </p><p>TRADITIONAL NORTH AMERICAN SOURCES THAT BOTH ARCTIC </p><p>RESERVES AND LARGE IMPORTS OF LNG WILL BE THE TREND OVER </p><p>THE NEXT TEN YEARS.  ALL OF THESE GENTLEMEN CAUTION THAT </p><p>RATHER THAN VIEWING THE WINTER OF 2003 AS AN UNUSUALLY </p><p>COLD ONE, WE SHOULD VIEW IT AS MERELY A RETURN TO </p><p>NORMALCY AND VERY HIGH GAS DEMAND. </p><p> </p><p>CLIMATE CHANGE: BETTER MADE IN EDMONTON THAN OTTAWA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) WHILE DISTRUST OF OTTAWA ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND </p><p>KYOTO IMPLEMENTATION (AND MOST OTHER THINGS) REMAINS THE </p><p>NORM IN ALBERTA, THE EXTREME HOSTILITY TO OTTAWA-DRIVEN </p><p>POLICY OF A FEW MONTHS AGO HAS MODERATED.  FROM WHAT </p><p>ALBERTA ENVIRONMENT MINISTER LOREN TAYLOR TOLD US, </p><p>ALBERTA IS HOPING TO HAVE ITS "MADE IN ALBERTA" CLIMATE </p><p>CHANGE PROGRAM (PERHAPS INCLUDING EMISSIONS TRADING) UP </p><p>AND RUNNING LONG BEFORE OTTAWA HAS ITS KYOTO </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OPERATIONAL.  THE ALBERTA PLAN WOULD </p><p>BE MODELED IN MANY RESPECTS ON THE MARKET-DRIVEN U.S. </p><p>"EMISSIONS EFFICIENCY" APPROACH RATHER THAN THE MORE </p><p>"COMMAND AND CONTROL" VERSION THEY SEE AS COMING FROM </p><p>OTTAWA.  TAYLOR ALSO EXPRESSED ENTHUSIASM FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S CLEAN SKIES INITIATIVE TO REDUCE NOX, SOX AND </p><p>MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS AND IS INTERESTED IN </p><p>A SIMILAR MODEL FOR ALBERTA AND CANADA.  FOR THEIR PART, </p><p>WHILE SUCH INDUSTRY LEADERS AS CAPP\'S Alvarez_, BP\'S </p><p>FAITHFULL AND MIDDLE-MANAGERS AT PETROCANADA ARE ANYTHING </p><p>BUT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT OTTAWA APPROACH TO KYOTO, THEY </p><p>VIEW IT AS MERELY ONE MORE FORM OF RISK TO BE MANAGED. </p><p>MOST SEEM TO TAKE THE VIEW THAT BY THE TIME </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION IS FAR ADVANCED "PAUL MARTIN WILL BE PM\' </p><p>AND HE "UNDERSTANDS AND SUPPORTS" THE OIL AND GAS </p><p>INDUSTRY.  IN THE MEANTIME, THEY ARE NEGOTIATING </p><p>FURIOUSLY WITH WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS A STILL DEEPLY </p><p>FRACTURED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHILE WORRYING AS MUCH OR </p><p>MORE ABOUT COST-OVERRUNS AS THEY ARE ABOUT KYOTO.  FROM </p><p>OUR END, WE HAVE TO AGREE THAT THE NATURAL RESOURCES </p><p>CANADA-ENVIRONMENT CANADA FEUD THAT KYOTO RATIFICATION </p><p>LAST DECEMBER WAS SUPPOSED TO END, IS ALIVE AND WELL AND </p><p>PROBABLY TAKING MORE VICTIMS.
