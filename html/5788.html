<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000351 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:12/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MASS, NI, IV, FR, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: OULD ABDALLAH ON COTE D\'IVOIRE </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Abidjan 271 </p><p>-     USUN 314 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: Amadou Ould-Abdallah February 6 told </p><p>Ambassador Jeter that several factors had engendered the </p><p>post-Marcoussis disarray.  Ould-Abdallah thought Kufuor </p><p>would be more effective as ECOWAS Chairman than Wade had </p><p>been.  The French had leverage but were losing a little </p><p>every day by failing to use it.  Ould-Abdallah said Albert </p><p>Tevoedjre\'s appointment was a positive step but felt the </p><p>Beninois relied too heavily on prayer rather than </p><p>diplomacy.  Nigeria could and should play a useful role, </p><p>but Gbagbo\'s prevarications early on had discouraged them. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Over breakfast at the Ambassador\'s Residence on </p><p>February 6, UN West Africa Special Representative Amadou </p><p>Ould-Abdallah told Ambassador Jeter that he had been </p><p>spending a disproportionate share of his time on Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire.  He thought the appointment of Benin\'s Albert </p><p>Tevoedjre would allow him more time for other issues, such </p><p>as advancing implementation of the ICJ ruling on the </p><p>Nigeria-Cameroon border dispute (septel).  Ould-Abdallah </p><p>called Tevoedjre experienced and learned but commented that </p><p>the Beninois sometimes put too much faith in the power of </p><p>prayer to bring antagonists together. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Ould-Abdallah thought Ghana\'s John Kufuor would be </p><p>a more effective ECOWAS Chairman than Senegalese President </p><p>Abdoulaye Wade had been.  Kufuor "speaks frankly, but he is </p><p>friendly and not lecturing."  While Wade had a strong sense </p><p>of the issues at play in Cote d\'Ivoire, he presumed too </p><p>much as a result of his title as ECOWAS Chairman, signing </p><p>letters in that capacity without having first thoroughly </p><p>vetted them with his colleagues, for example.  But his </p><p>heart was in the right place, and he sought a just outcome. </p><p>Ould-Abdallah was less sure of Eyadema\'s motivations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ould-Abdallah sharply criticized Eyadema\'s efforts </p><p>to undermine Wade.  The Ivoirian had wanted international </p><p>mediation "to become African under Eyadema."  This was a </p><p>"very cheap" ploy that had been intended to "play African </p><p>against African."  Ould-Abdallah thought that Kufuor\'s </p><p>accession to the ECOWAS Chairmanship would eventually </p><p>reduce Eyadema\'s role as Gbagbo had more confidence and </p><p>trust in Kufuor than in Wade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s question, Ould- </p><p>Abdallah contended that Gbagbo and others had not focused </p><p>on the implications of the rebels\' request for the Defense </p><p>and Interior Ministries.  "Bedie and Gbago wanted the money </p><p>portfolios - Agriculture, Finance and Works," Ould-Abdallah </p><p>said.  He conceded that the rebels\' alacrity in telling the </p><p>media of their coup had aggravated the problem but was not </p><p>the decisive issue.  "Anyway, the demonstrations [by Gbagbo </p><p>backers] were not really spontaneous; we have reason to </p><p>think he (Gbagbo) encouraged them" (see also ref A).  There </p><p>was also the problem of those who rebelled against lawful </p><p>authority in essence now becoming that authority over the </p><p>heads of those who had fought to uphold it, as well as </p><p>personality issues associated with Guillaume Soro and </p><p>Louis-Andre Dakourey.  Finally, Gbagbo\'s wife, a power in </p><p>Parliament herself, was taking a hard line. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Was there a role for Ouattara?, the Ambassador </p><p>asked.  Ould-Abdallah responded with sharp criticism of </p><p>Ouattara for his failure to "bring people on board" after </p><p>his electoral victory.  Ouattara had scarcely lived in </p><p>Africa and was "too much an international civil servant" to </p><p>identify effectively with the Ivorian people.  However, the </p><p>GOCI and its political allies had "so demonized" Ouattara </p><p>that he was now a symbol of northern resistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Ambassador Jeter regretted that contention at the </p><p>highest levels of Ivorian politics, and between Togo and </p><p>Senegal had precluded a quick success for ECOWAS efforts. </p><p>Ould-Abdallah opined that in circumstances that come close </p><p>to civil war, those who can inspire fear and those who can </p><p>offer something to meet a need have leverage.  The French, </p><p>he said, have leverage on both scores but are unable to use </p><p>it effectively.  As a result, their leverage is slowly </p><p>being attenuated.  The Nigerians were the first to come to </p><p>Gbagbo\'s assistance, but he lied to them, so Obasanjo </p><p>effectively withdrew from the fray.  Ould-Abdallah was </p><p>pleased to see Abuja slowly re-engaging: Nigeria could and </p><p>should play a continuing diplomatic role; it would be </p><p>difficult to find a durable solution without Nigerian </p><p>participation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  We concur in Ould-Abdallah\'s assessment </p><p>of the need for strong Nigerian engagement on the Cote </p><p>d\'Ivoire, and we have done what we can to promote stronger </p><p>and more persistent Nigerian diplomatic engagement. </p><p>Obasanjo and others in the GON now seem to be paying close </p><p>attention to Cote d\'Ivoire.  Gbagbo may be more comfortable </p><p>with Kufuor as ECOWAS Chairman than he was with Wade in </p><p>that role.  That fact too may facilitate mediation. </p><p>However, alone among ECOWAS states, Nigeria possesses the </p><p>military muscle and political weight to apply real pressure </p><p>to recalcitrant players. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
