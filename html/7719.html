<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 002529 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDANIAN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS SET FOR JUNE 17; </p><p>ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT ANNOUNCES IT WILL RUN </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) AMMAN 2402 (B) AMMAN 2504 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) In a conversation with the Ambassador on April 25, </p><p>King Abdullah confirmed that Jordan will hold Parliamentary </p><p>elections on June 17, as PM Ali Abul Ragheb had publicly </p><p>affirmed a week earlier (ref A).  The King told the </p><p>Ambassador that although some voices had been advising him to </p><p>delay the elections once again until the autumn, he was </p><p>committed to the June 17 date.  The King noted that GID </p><p>Director Sa\'ad Kheir has been strongly supportive of the </p><p>decision to go ahead with the elections, evaluating that the </p><p>U.S.\'s swift and decisive victory in Iraq has left the </p><p>Jordanian political opposition "off balance" and has </p><p>increased the odds that pro-government candidates will fare </p><p>well if elections are held sooner rather than later. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Subsequent to the Ambassador\'s conversation with the </p><p>King, the Islamic Action Front (IAF) -- the political wing of </p><p>the Muslim Brotherhood and Jordan\'s only real opposition </p><p>political party -- announced April 25 that it had decided to </p><p>end its 1997 boycott of parliamentary elections.  In an </p><p>emergency meeting on April 25, all 120 members of the IAF\'s </p><p>Shura Council voted that the Party should participate in the </p><p>June elections.  IAF Shura Council leader Abdul Latif </p><p>Arabiyat told the Jordan Times that the party decided to </p><p>review its position on participating in the elections because </p><p>of political developments and "the dangers facing the entire </p><p>region."  He added "we hope our decision to rescind the </p><p>boycott will be appreciated and looked at positively by the </p><p>other side (i.e. the GOJ)."  On April 27, the Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood\'s 50-member Shura council echoed the IAF\'s </p><p>decision by announcing in a statement that the MB had also </p><p>endorsed participation in the June 17 elections. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The King\'s thinking on elections clearly appears to </p><p>have solidified over the past couple of weeks as the Iraq </p><p>crisis has subsided.  His decision to hold to the June 17 </p><p>electoral date -- only a few days prior to the just-announced </p><p>convening of a special session of the World Economic Forum in </p><p>Jordan (ref B) -- indicates  confidence that changed </p><p>circumstances in the region will enable both elections and </p><p>the WEF meeting to take place and highlight Jordan\'s </p><p>moderate, pro-reform positions. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
