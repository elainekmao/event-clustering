(S) On March 13, polmiloff met with Ferhat Alkan of the </p><p>MFA\'s Iraq Desk and delivered Ref A points.  Alkan remarked </p><p>that the information was "news" to the MFA.  He promised to </p><p>pass the information immediately to the Turkish National </p><p>Intelligence Agency (TNIO), the Turkish General Staff, and </p><p>via the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade, to Turkish Customs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Polmiloff pressed Alkan regarding the mechanics of </p><p>the GOT\'s preventing the exports and the method by which it </p><p>would prevent third-country trans-shipments.  Alkan responded </p><p>that, depending on the stage of the business transaction, </p><p>either the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade would refuse the </p><p>export permit, or Turkish Customs would attempt to intercept </p><p>an outbound shipment.  In response to polmiloff\'s reminder </p><p>regarding Ref D, Alkan said that Foreign Trade had stopped </p><p>exports of atropine autoinjectors in response to Post\'s </p><p>February demarche and that the sole Iraqi-related shipment </p><p>had been in August 2002.  In regard to Ref B, he told </p><p>polmiloff that Foreign Trade is alert to the import and/or </p><p>export of the meteorological balloons, but had not yet </p><p>encountered them.  He noted that the TNIO has and would look </p><p>into all firms that we have brought to the GOT\'s attention. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
