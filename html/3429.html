<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 004304 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA -- MCDONALD, PIPATANGUL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/25/2007 </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN TRADE MINISTER\'S IRAQ TRIP "ONLY FOR </p><p>APPEARANCES" </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  According to the number two Ministry official, Trade </p><p>Minister Salah al-Bashir\'s July 19-23 visit to Baghdad was </p><p>primarily for show, and added little to the bilateral </p><p>economic relationship.  He noted that some adjustments had </p><p>been proposed to the bilateral oil and trade protocols to </p><p>offset prospective imbalances resulting from the increase in </p><p>global oil prices.  There was discussion of a bilteral FTA, </p><p>but no progress toward that end.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>IT\'S ATMOSPHERICS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Trade Ministry Secretary General Samer Tawil told </p><p>Econoff July 25 that the July 19-23 trip to Baghdad on which </p><p>he accompanied Trade Minister Salah al-Bashir was little more </p><p>than damage control following Prince Hassan\'s recent surprise </p><p>appearance and comments at the meeting of exiled Iraqi </p><p>officers in London.  Tawil said local publicity surrounding </p><p>the trip was a GOJ gesture to a peeved Iraqi leadership. </p><p>Tawil added that the political nature of the trip, and the </p><p>desire of the GOJ to steer clear of substantive negotiations </p><p>with Iraq on trade issues, mean that technical level people </p><p>on the GOJ side were not included on the trip. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Tawil reported that the Iraqis asked that the </p><p>ceiling on 2002 Jordanian exports to Iraq be raised to </p><p>compensate for the increase in crude prices (now over $25/bbl </p><p>compared to about $19/bbl when the protocols were signed). </p><p>Tawil said he tentatively agreed, but said that Jordanian </p><p>suppliers of extra exports (above the previously agreed </p><p>ceiling) would be paid by the GOJ in 2003 (i.e., some letters </p><p>of credit to Jordanian suppliers approved in the fourth </p><p>quarter of 2002 would only be issued in 2003).  Thus, </p><p>increased outlays to Jordanian suppliers would not impact </p><p>Jordan\'s 2002 budget. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Tawil added that other "agreements" announced after </p><p>Bashir\'s visit, like the removal of 14 Jordanian companies </p><p>from Iraq\'s "black list" of normalizers, were either </p><p>overblown, were announcements of deals completed far in the </p><p>past, or both.  Finally, he told Econoff that, while the </p><p>issue of a Jordan-Iraq FTA was raised by the Iraqis, no </p><p>progress was made or even seriously attempted. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Through this sleight of hand, Tawil hopes that the </p><p>cost of greater Jordanian exports in 2002 will be postponed </p><p>until next year, to be paid for out of Iraqi oil shipped then </p><p>(using cash raised by the oil\'s sale by the GOJ to the </p><p>refinery company).  Indeed he probably hopes to minimize the </p><p>impact by adjusting the still to be negotiated agreed level </p><p>of 2003 exports.  In a way, however, Tawil\'s scheme could end </p><p>up backfiring if 2003 subsidized oil imports are interrupted </p><p>for any reason, including a U.S.-Iraq confrontation.  In that </p><p>event, the GOJ would still owe suppliers, but not have the </p><p>income stream to provide the cash.  Indeed, this could come </p><p>at just the time when extra funds are needed to buy oil on </p><p>the market. </p><p>Berry </p><p></p></div>
