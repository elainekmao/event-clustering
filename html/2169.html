CHI </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT MUCH OF THE SUMMIT\'S DISCUSSIONS WERE </p><p>CENTERED ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND HOW TO COPE WITH IT. </p><p>CHI SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN IMPRESSED THAT ASEAN, AN </p><p>ORGANIZATION THAT HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN FAIRLY WED TO A PRE- </p><p>DETERMINED AGENDA PLANNED MONTHS IN ADVANCE, HAD BEEN ABLE </p><p>SO QUICKLY TO INCORPORATE A FOCUS ON THIS TOPIC AFTER THE </p><p>EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11.  HE CLAIMED THAT PM KHAI MADE A PUSH </p><p>TO URGE ALL MEMBERS TO RATIFY ALL 12 CONVENTIONS AGAINST </p><p>TERRORISM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND WAS ALSO INSTRUMENTAL IN </p><p>PUTTING FORWARD THE SUCCESSFUL PROPOSAL THAT ASEAN CONVENE </p><p>MINISTERIAL CONFERENCES AT THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER LEVELS, PROBABLY IN FEBRUARY AND APRIL </p><p>RESPECTIVELY, TO DISCUSS THE CURRENT THREAT AND CONCRETE </p><p>MEASURES TO COUNTER TERRORISM.

HE SAID THAT THE LEADERS FOCUSED ON COUNTER- </p><p>MEASURES AGAINST TERRORISM IN THE REGION INSTEAD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO CHI, LEADERS DISCUSSED CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>ASEAN\'S FUTURE GIVEN DEVELOPMENTAL GAPS BETWEEN THE "OLD" </p><p>AND "NEW" MEMBERS.  CHI STATED THAT ASEAN COULD NOT "MOVE </p><p>FORWARD IF NEIGHBORS ARE TOO POOR."  HE CITED THE DISPARITY </p><p>BETWEEN THAILAND AND MYANMAR AS A CASE IN POINT.  CHI NOTED </p><p>PARTICULAR GAPS WITHIN ASEAN REGARDING INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>(INCLUDING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY) AND HUMAN RESOURCES </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  HE SAID THE LEADERS HAD ALSO DISCUSSED THE </p><p>NEED TO PROMOTE INTRA-ASIAN TRADE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE </p><p>GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN.  HE POINTED TO CAMBODIAN PRIME </p><p>MINISTER HUN SEN\'S PROPOSAL TO CREATE ANOTHER GROWTH </p><p>TRIANGLE FOR THE MEKONG REGION AS AN EXAMPLE.  LEADERS ALSO </p><p>DISCUSSED THE NEED TO COMPLETE SINGAPORE-KUNMING RAIL LINKS </p><p>(VIA CAMBODIA AND VIETNAM). </p><p> </p><p>5.

(SBU)  CHI EXPLAINED THAT LEADERS HAD DISCUSSED, WITHOUT </p><p>CONCLUSION, THE IDEA OF AN ASEAN SUMMIT WITH INDIA, ON AN </p><p>ANNUAL OR BIANNUAL BASIS.  HE SAID THAT SOUTH KOREA, WITH </p><p>SUPPORT FROM JAPAN AND MALAYSIA, HAD SOUGHT TO STRENGTHEN </p><p>THE ASEAN+3 PROCESS (MUCH ALONG THE LINES OF THE EARLIER </p><p>EAEC CONCEPT), WHILE SINGAPORE REMAINED OPPOSED TO SUCH </p><p>ACTION.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE ONLY DISCUSSION OF THE </p><p>SPRATLEYS DURING THE ASEAN+3 MEETING CAME WHEN CHINA AND THE </p><p>PHILIPPINES SEPARATELY EXPRESSED HOPES FOR THE CONCLUSION OF </p><p>A CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THE REGION.  CHI ALSO SAID THAT IN </p><p>ORDER TO EXPAND ASEAN\'S EXTERNAL RELATIONS FURTHER, THE </p><p>"MYANMAR PROBLEM" WILL HAVE TO BE RESOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) CHI RATED THE MEETINGS AS "FULLY SUCCESSFUL" AND </p><p>NOTED THAT VIETNAM WAS "FULLY SATISFIED."  HE GAVE GOOD </p><p>MARKS TO BRUNEI\'S ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP.  THE ONLY </p><p>GLITCH CAME DURING THE LAO PRIME MINISTER\'S REMARKS, MOST OF </p><p>WHICH FOR SOME REASON WERE NOT TRANSLATED SO THE OTHER </p><p>LEADERS COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
