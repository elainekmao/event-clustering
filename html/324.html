(U)  THE FOLLOWING WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT WAS ISSUED </p><p>AT 0140 HOURS DECEMBER 20: </p><p></p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p></p><p>THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED UNITED STATES FORCES TO </p><p>EXECUTE AT 1:00 AM THIS MORNING PRE-PLANNED MISSIONS IN </p><p>PANAMA TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES, RESTORE THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PROCESS, PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL </p><p>TREATIES, AND APPREHEND MANUEL NORIEGA. </p><p></p><p>THE SITUATION IN PANAMA UNDER NORIEGA HAS REACHED A </p><p>CRISIS.  DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN THWARTED, </p><p>AMERICAN LIVES HAVE BEEN ENDANGERED.  THE INTEGRITY OF </p><p>THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES IS AT RISK.  NORIEGA IS UNDER </p><p>INDICTMENT FOR DRUG-RELATED CHARGES.  THE PRESIDENT HAS </p><p>MADE EVERY EFFORT PEACEFULLY TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION </p><p>THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AND LATIN AMERICAN </p><p>LEADERS.  NORIEGA HAS REJECTED ALL THESE EFFORTS. </p><p></p><p>LAST FRIDAY, NORIEGA DECLARED A STATE OF WAR WITH </p><p>THE UNITED STATES.  THE NEXT DAY THE PDF SHOT TO DEATH </p><p>AN UNARMED AMERICAN SERVICEMAN, WOUNDED ANOTHER, SEIZED </p><p>AND BEAT ANOTHER SERVICEMAN AND SEXUALLY THREATENED HIS </p><p>WIFE.  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PRESIDENT DECIDED </p><p>HE MUST ACT TO PREVENT FURTHER VIOLENCE.  OUR TROOPS </p><p>WILL USE ONLY THE FORCE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE </p><p>OBJECTIVES AND WILL BE WITHDRAWN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. </p><p></p><p>AT APPROXIMATELY MIDNIGHT TONIGHT, THE </p><p>DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED LEADERS OF PANAMA--PRESIDENT </p><p>ENDARA AND VICE PRESIDENTS ARIAS CALDERON AND FORD--WERE </p><p>SWORN IN AND ASSUMED THEIR RIGHTFUL POSITIONS.  THEY </p><p>WELCOME AND SUPPORT OUR ACTIONS AND HAVE STATED THEIR </p><p>INTENTION TO INSTITUTE A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT </p><p>IMMEDIATELY.  THE UNITED STATES HAS RECOGNIZED THAT </p><p>GOVERNMENT, IS RESTORING NORMAL RELATIONS, AND WILL </p><p>COOPERATE TO REBUILD A FREE AND PROSPEROUS PANAMA.  END </p><p>TEXT. </p><p></p><p>4.  (C)  YOU SHOULD ALSO MAKE THE FOLLOWING POINTS: </p><p></p><p>--  THE PRESIDENT TOOK THIS ACTION ONLY AFTER </p><p>EXHAUSTING EVERY AVAILABLE DIPLOMATIC AND MULTI-LATERAL </p><p>MEANS TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS. </p><p></p><p>--  IN RECENT DAYS, THE CRISIS HAS GROWN FAR MORE </p><p>DANGEROUS.  NORIEGA HAS ACTED INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE, </p><p>UNPREDICTABLE, AND DANGEROUS. </p><p></p><p>--  THE U.S. HAD INCREASING FEAR OF NEW  MORE </p><p>THREATENING ACTS OF VIOLENCE DIRECTED AGAINST AMERICANS. </p><p></p><p>--  THE U.S. WILL ONLY USE FORCE AS REQUIRED TO </p><p>ARREST NORIEGA AND RESTRAIN THE PDF FROM COMING TO HIS </p><p>RESCUE.  THE U.S. HOPES TO WITHDRAW ITS FORCES AS </p><p>QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. </p><p></p><p>--  THE U.S. CONSULTED WITH THE LEADERS OF THE </p><p>PANAMANIAN OPPOSITION ELECTED IN THE MAY 7TH ELECTIONS </p><p>AND THEY APPROVED OF THIS ACTION.  THEY HAVE BEEN SWORN </p><p>IN AND HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY WILL BE FORMING A GOVERNMENT </p><p>IMMEDIATELY.  THE U.S. HAS RECOGNIZED THIS GOVERNMENT. </p><p></p><p>--  THESE LEADERS WERE UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, INCLUDING OBSERVERS FROM DOZENS </p><p>OF NATIONS, AS THE RIGHTFUL VICTORS IN THE PANAMANIAN </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THEY WARRANT RECOGNITION BY HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>AND THE U.S. URGES HOST GOVERNMENT TO EXTEND SUCH </p><p>RECOGNITION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  THIS WILL IN ITSELF </p><p>HELP STABILIZE THE SITUATION, REDUCE THE PROSPECTS FOR </p><p>ADDITIONAL VIOLENCE, AND PERMIT THE U.S. TO WITHDRAW ITS </p><p>FORCES QUICKLY. </p><p></p><p>--  THE U.S. IS FULLY COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE </p><p>PANAMA CANAL TREATIES.  INDEED, ONE ADDITIONAL REASON </p><p>THE PRESIDENT HAD TO ACT WAS TO SAFEGUARD THE CANAL AND </p><p>UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY OF THE TREATIES. </p><p></p><p>--  THE PRESIDENT TOOK THIS ACTION ONLY AS A LAST </p><p>RESORT.  HE DID SO FOR 4 REASONS: </p><p></p><p>I. TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES; </p><p>II. TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY; </p><p>III. TO ARREST AN INDICTED DRUG TRAFFICKER; AND </p><p>IV. TO DEFEND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES. </p><p></p><p>--  WE HOPE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT THIS </p><p>ACTION.  IT IS IMPORTANT, IN PARTICULAR, THAT THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RALLY AROUND THE NEW DEMOCRATIC </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA, JUST AS IT DID AROUND ENDARA, </p><p>ARIAS CALDERON, AND FORD WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED AND </p><p>BRUTALIZED FOLLOWING THE MAY 7 ELECTIONS. </p><p></p><p>--  THE U.S. INTENDS TO HELP THE NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p>RESTORE PANAMA\'S ECONOMY.  YOUR SUPPORT WOULD BE </p><p>IMPORTANT AND WELCOME IN THIS EFFORT. </p><p></p><p>--  U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU INFORMED AS </p><p>EVENTS DEVELOP. </p><p></p><p>5.  FOR NICARAGUA AND CUBA: </p><p></p><p>THE SECURITY OF YOUR DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN PANAMA IS </p><p>NOT THREATENED IN ANY WAY.  THE U.S. HAS NO INTENTION TO </p><p>ENLARGE THIS ACTION BEYOND PANAMA AND WE EXPECT YOUR </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO ACT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p></p><p>6.  FOR NICARAGUA ONLY: </p><p></p><p>THE U.S. REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE ESQUIPULAS, TESORO </p><p>BEACH, AND TELA ACCORDS AND TO RESPECT THE RESULTS OF A </p><p>FREE AND FAIR ELECTION IN NICARAGUA NO MATTER WHO WINS. </p><p>THIS ACTION IN PANAMA SHOULD NOT DIVERT EITHER OF OUR </p><p>NATIONS FROM PURSUING A DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>RESOLUTION TO THE CONFLICTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
