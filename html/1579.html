PALMA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE RESPONSES TO MALLOCH- </p><p>BROWN LETTER </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 783 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES EARL M. IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) THE MARCH 14 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE (GOZ)-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" NEWSPAPER </p><p>REPORTED THAT ON MARCH 13 THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS, STAINSLAUS MUDENGE, HANDED TO UNITED NATIONS </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP) RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>VICTOR ANGELO THE LETTER CONTAINING THE GOZ\'S RESPONSE </p><p>TO THE DECEMBER 15 LETTER OF UNDP ADMINISTRATOR MARK </p><p>MALLOCH BROWN.  ALTHOUGH THE PRO-GOVERNMENT DAILY DID </p><p>NOT REVEAL THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER, IT REPORTED </p><p>THAT ANGELO "PLEDGED TO STUDY THE RESPONSE </p><p>\'POSITIVELY,\'" AND FORWARD IT IMMEDIATELY TO MALLOCH </p><p>BROWN IN NEW YORK.  THE ARTICLE FURTHER STATED THAT </p><p>MUDENGE HAD TOLD UN SYG KOFI ANNAN AND MALLOCH BROWN </p><p>AT A RECENT MEETING AT THE UN IN NEW YORK THAT THE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS IN MALLOCH BROWN\'S LETTER HAD ALREADY </p><p>BEEN OVERTAKEN BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE "FAST- </p><p>TRACK" PROGRAM, AND THAT WHAT THE UNDP SHOULD NOW BE </p><p>CONSIDERING WAS HOW TO AID THE "70,000 PEOPLE" THAT </p><p>THE GOZ CLAIMS HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY RESETTLED UNDER </p><p>THE PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SPEAKING TO CHARGE ON MARCH 14, ANGELO WAS </p><p>CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT THE GOZ RESPONSE PROVIDED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01016  141229Z </p><p>AN OPENING WITH WHICH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>COULD WORK.  HE REPORTED THAT THE ZIMBABWEANS HAD </p><p>ACCEPTED PLACEMENT OF THE TECHNICAL UNIT WITHIN UNDP </p><p>PREMISES AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE ON </p><p>THE LAND REFORM PROCESS WAS NECESSARY AND THAT IT </p><p>SHOULD TAKE PLACE UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>ECONOMIC CONSULTATIVE FORUM.  THE UNDP RESREP SAID </p><p>THAT THE GOZ\'S LETTER CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTED THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF A TRUST FUND MANAGED BY UNDP. </p><p>FINALLY, THE LETTER MADE AN APPEAL FOR HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO THE VICTIMS OF FLOODING AS A RESULT OF </p><p>EXCESSIVE RAINS IN ZIMBABWE.  ANGELO CONCLUDED WITH </p><p>HIS ASSESSMENT THAT THE GOZ HAD ADVANCED SOME </p><p>"POSITIVE HYPOTHESES" IN ITS RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: THE GOZ\'S RESPONSE TO THE MALLOCH </p><p>BROWN LETTER, BASED ON MUDENGE\'S COMMENTS IN "THE </p><p>HERALD" ARTICLE, WILL LIKELY NOT PROVIDE A WAY FOR THE </p><p>GOZ TO GET OUT OF THE CORNER THEY HAVE PLACED </p><p>THEMSELVES IN ON THE LAND ISSUE.  ANGELO\'S ACCOUNT, </p><p>WHILE ADMITTEDLY HURRIED, IS SILENT ON THE GOZ\'S </p><p>RESPONSE TO MALLOCH BROWN\'S RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING </p><p>THE FOLLOWING: THE NEED FOR A RETURN OF THE RULE OF </p><p>LAW ON THE OCCUPIED COMMERCIAL FARMS, AGREEING THAT </p><p>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LAND FOLLOWS THE RULES </p><p>ESTABLISHED BY LAW WITH OWNERS HAVING FULL RIGHT TO </p><p>COURT-ORDERED REMEDIES, COMMENCING SETTLEMENT ON LANDS </p><p>ALREADY STATE-OWNED AND LEGALLY ACQUIRED, ACCEPTING </p><p>AND SUPPORTING COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES TO LAND REFORM </p><p>BY LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, AND ACCEPTING THAT THE </p><p>OVERARCHING GOAL OF LAND REFORM SHOULD BE REDUCING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01016  141229Z </p><p>POVERTY IN RURAL AREAS AND THAT ITS BENEFACTORS BE </p><p>SELECTED WITH THAT IN MIND IN A TRANSPARENT MANNER. </p><p>OUR MOST RECENT SOUNDINGS OF THE GOZ POSITION SUGGEST </p><p>THE LATTER WILL CONTINUE TO ESCHEW ADVICE FROM THE </p><p>UNDP AND DONOR NATIONS AND PROCEED WITH THE CHAOTIC, </p><p>POLITICALLY DRIVEN "FAST-TRACK" RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE. </p><p>WHILE THE EVER SUNNY ANGELO MAY SEE A LIGHT AT THE END </p><p>OF THE TUNNEL, FROM WHAT WE KNOW OF THE GOZ\'S POSITION </p><p>AND THE LIKELY CONTENTS OF THE RESPONSE TO THE MALLOCH </p><p>BROWN LETTER, THE UNDP INITIATIVE ON LAND REFORM IS </p><p>DEAD ON THE GROUND IN ZIMBABWE.  UNDER THESE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, WE WOULD BE LOATH TO PROVIDE ANY </p><p>FURTHER MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR THE TSU OR ANY OTHER UN </p><p>INITIATIVES ON THIS SUBJECT AT THIS TIME.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
