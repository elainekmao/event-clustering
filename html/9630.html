TEGUCIGALPA 861 </p><p>     B. TEGUCIGALPA 1309 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Section Chief, Francisco Palmieri; Reasons 1.5 </p><p> (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  (SBU) On July 9, Human Rights Commissioner for </p><p>Honduras, Ramon Custodio, presented the results of the </p><p>Commission\'s investigation into the April 5 massacre of 68 </p><p>prisoners at the El Porvenir Prison, located outside of the </p><p>Caribbean port city of La Ceiba.  The report supported </p><p>allegations that elements of the police and military were </p><p>involved in the deaths of prisoners, charging that security </p><p>forces executed unarmed gang members who attempted to </p><p>surrender to authorities (Reftel B).  The report states that </p><p>the 25 individuals who burned to death (23 Mara-18 members </p><p>and 3 female visitors) witnessed the execution of other </p><p>inmates who had surrendered, and thus, may have chosen to </p><p>remain in their burning cells, rather than face summary </p><p>execution.  The report alleges that prior to the arrival of </p><p>military and police forces, only 10 of the 68 deaths had </p><p>occurred.  It charges that nearly all of the remaining deaths </p><p>can be attributed to police and military forces. </p><p>Furthermore, the report implicates the police in a cover-up </p><p>of the executions committed by military and police units, </p><p>while also faulting the Public Ministry\'s shoddy forensics </p><p>testing and mishandling of the crime scene.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>The Violence Begins </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  According to the report, the violence began when </p><p>between five and ten Mara-18 gang inmates brandishing </p><p>firearms, shot and killed several prison "trusties" (non-gang </p><p>member inmates charged with enforcing discipline in the </p><p>prison).  (Note:  The report suggests as a possible motive </p><p>for the attack, that gang members may have sought retribution </p><p>for a prison raid on April 3 in which trusties and prison </p><p>security confiscated 4 machetes, 16 knives and 8 firearms </p><p>from cells 2 and 6, where gang members resided.  "Trusties" </p><p>and prison security authorities then sentenced gang members </p><p>to 48 hours of solitary confinement.  The report notes that </p><p>the gang members were released from isolation the morning of </p><p>the massacre.  Furthermore, the report also places blame on </p><p>an unauthorized transfer of 30 Mara-18 inmates from a federal </p><p>prison at Tamara to El Porvenir on February 6, 2003, which </p><p>may have disturbed the balance of power between gang and </p><p>non-gang members, leading to conflict. Separately, </p><p>conventional wisdom here is that this importation was a </p><p>showdown between different prison elements over control of </p><p>the drug trade in the prison.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Police, Military Forces Arrive, Chaos Ensues </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The report contends that when prison security units </p><p>arrived, only five individuals had been killed.  Shortly </p><p>after prison security deemed the area under control, numerous </p><p>different police and military forces arrived, including the </p><p>Preventive Police Special Forces (COBRA), elements of the </p><p>First Battalion of Marine Infantry, Tourist Police, prison </p><p>police, and members of the Fourth Infantry Battalion, who </p><p>were apparently confronted by a mob yelling for the police to </p><p>kill Mara-18 gang members.  According to the Commission\'s </p><p>report, security forces entered the prison and opened fire on </p><p>unarmed gang members and either condoned or encouraged the </p><p>remaining trusties to kill those gang members who lay wounded </p><p>throughout the prison courtyard.  Subsequently, the </p><p>"trusties," set fire to the cellblocks where the majority of </p><p>gang members resided.  Some witness testimonies indicate that </p><p>kerosene from the prison kitchen was used to ignite the fire, </p><p>while others point to the use of gasoline. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The report further contends that police and military </p><p>authorities then ordered inmates in cellblocks 2 and 6 to </p><p>surrender.  The prisoners surrendering, who were unarmed and </p><p>with hands in the air, were then summarily executed by armed </p><p>security agents, who have since alleged that they were </p><p>following orders from "trusties."  Autopsy reports confirm </p><p>eyewitness testimonies that police units were responsible for </p><p>the deaths of unarmed prisoners.  Direct testimony also </p><p>exists implicating a COBRA in the killing of an unarmed, </p><p>wounded man. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>25 Burn to Death, Others Executed </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The report states that, according to witness </p><p>testimonies, most of the gang members were not involved in </p><p>the violence and voluntarily returned to their cells once </p><p>shooting began.  Gang members who retreated to their cells </p><p>left cellblock doors open with the exception of cell block 6, </p><p>whose door was partially obstructed, trapping prisoners </p><p>inside.  The report suggests that many of the remaining </p><p>inmates witnessed or heard the executions of those who had </p><p>surrendered, and subsequently chose to remain in their </p><p>burning cellblocks, rather than face execution.  22 inmates </p><p>and 3 female visitors burned to death as the fire consumed </p><p>two contiguous cell blocks. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Crime Scene Contaminated, Investigation Incomplete </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  According to the report, the integrity of the crime </p><p>scene was compromised by prison "trusties" and police who </p><p>moved bodies and "tampered" with evidence prior to the 11AM </p><p>orders from Commissioner Henriquez not to contaminate the </p><p>crime scene.  Additionally, the report outlines a litany of </p><p>criticisms of the Public Ministry\'s investigation.  Bodies </p><p>prematurely removed from the crime scene were left to </p><p>decompose in the heat for days before being analyzed by </p><p>forensic experts.  Limited forensics testing was conducted to </p><p>determine the cause of death of most victims, and no analysis </p><p>was done of the carbon dioxide levels in the blood of the </p><p>deceased (to determine if the cause of death was fire).  Most </p><p>of the bullets were not removed from the bodies of the </p><p>deceased.  Consequently, without the requisite forensic </p><p>analyses, x-rays or comprehensive ballistics tests, the exact </p><p>cause of death of most victims was never adequately </p><p>determined. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The autopsies that were conducted largely document </p><p>external, rather than internal lesions, indicating only a </p><p>superficial examination of the bodies.  To date, 15 bodies </p><p>remain in the San Pedro Sula morgue and have yet to be </p><p>officially identified, nor has any fingerprint testing been </p><p>employed as a means of identification.  According to the </p><p>report, ballistics investigators failed to identify the types </p><p>of arms used during the riot, and thus, were unable to </p><p>determine the exact cause(s) of death. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Public Ministry Faulted For Incomplete Investigation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The report also directed criticism at the Public </p><p>Ministry for its failure to execute a swift, thorough and </p><p>proper investigation.  The report urges the Public Ministry </p><p>to expedite the four cases it has developed against specific </p><p>individuals involved in the violence and to clarify the </p><p>charges it intends to bring against the individuals. </p><p>Additionally, the report calls for new ballistics tests, </p><p>autopsy reports and asks the Minister of Security to present </p><p>prosecutors with a complete list of all individuals present </p><p>during the killings.  Additionally, the report recommends a </p><p>revamping of the discipline system in the prison and the </p><p>elimination of the role of prison "trusties."  The report </p><p>asks police to identify the trusties killed and investigate </p><p>all of the parties involved.  Finally, it criticizes the </p><p>Director of MOPS Special Preventative Services for ordering </p><p>the premature and unauthorized relocation of Mara 18 gang </p><p>members from the prison to other prisons on February 6. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Comment.  The Honduras Human Rights Commission is a </p><p>well respected institution that works closely with Post on a </p><p>number of issues.  The Commission\'s findings support the </p><p>Honduran Internal Security Council\'s May 9 report that </p><p>assigned responsibility to GOH security forces for the vast </p><p>majority of the deaths at El Porvenir prison on April 5.  The </p><p>Commission\'s report, however, arrives at much more damaging </p><p>and far-reaching conclusions, including the identification of </p><p>the specific military units that were involved.  It remains </p><p>to be seen exactly what corrective and prosecutorial measures </p><p>the GOH plans to pursue regarding the incident, apart from </p><p>the mere window dressing of changing the prison warden. </p><p>Unfortunately, the extreme unpopularity of gang members, who </p><p>are seen by the Honduran public as the source of much of the </p><p>violence plaguing Honduras today, is unlikely to evoke </p><p>broader public outcry on human rights grounds.  End Comment. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
