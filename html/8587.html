<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000994 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, INR/NESA </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  06-09-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PINS, PHUM, SOCI, CE, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Domestic Politics Update:  Meeting between PM- </p><p>presidential aide stirs questions; MPs acting badly </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 975, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of Sri Lanka\'s domestic </p><p>political situation reviews the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- In meeting, prime minister and key presidential aide </p><p>reportedly discuss coalition government </p><p> </p><p>-- Supreme Court ruling puts provincial chief ministers </p><p>in jeopardy </p><p> </p><p>-- Sri Lanka debates whether to lift long-standing </p><p>moratorium and re-impose the death penalty </p><p> </p><p>-- Cricket board election hurts political prospects of </p><p>Opposition\'s bright new star </p><p> </p><p>-- Governing party MPs acting badly </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>Coalition Government Discussed? </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) There are reports that the GSL and the </p><p>Opposition may have discussed forming a coalition </p><p>government.  Key presidential advisor Lakshman </p><p>Kadirgamar was reported to have proposed a coalition </p><p>between the president\'s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) </p><p>and the ruling United National Front (UNF) during talks </p><p>with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe on June 6. </p><p>(Note:  The SLFP is the key constituent element of the </p><p>People\'s Alliance party.  Kadirgamar is a former foreign </p><p>minister.)  The press reports also indicate that </p><p>President Kumaratunga was considering naming Kadirgamar </p><p>as "interim prime minister" under this coalition </p><p>proposition.  In remarks cited by the press on June 8, </p><p>Kadirgamar denied the "coalition proposal" report. </p><p>Early June 9, presidential spokesman Harim Peiris gave </p><p>some validity to the report, telling us that the concept </p><p>of the SLFP and UNF working closer together "probably </p><p>surfaced" during the PM-Kadirgamar discussion.  Peiris </p><p>stressed, however, that the conversation probably did </p><p>not involve a proposal for a joint government. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  What exactly took place during the </p><p>PM/Kadirgamar discussion is a bit mysterious.  In the </p><p>past, there has been off-and-on talk of the two major </p><p>parties, i.e., the UNF and the SLFP, forming some sort </p><p>of "national" government, but those proposals went </p><p>nowhere.  In fact, the SLFP has been discussing a formal </p><p>alignment with the radical Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP) party of late, which would preclude a link with </p><p>the UNF.  While it is possible that the reports are some </p><p>sort of trial balloon put out by someone, our guess is </p><p>that a UNF-SLFP linkage is not in the cards at this </p><p>point, as there is too much bad blood between the two </p><p>sides.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>========================= </p><p>Ruling re Chief Ministers </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In a ruling with potentially wide political </p><p>ramifications, Sri Lanka\'s Supreme Court has ruled </p><p>against the legality of the chief minister of Uva </p><p>province\'s right to hold his office.  (Note:  FYI.  Uva </p><p>is a tea growing region located in Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>southeast.)  The ruling stated that the minister, a </p><p>member of the opposition People\'s Alliance (PA) party, </p><p>was not eligible to be nominated for the vacancy because </p><p>he was not originally a candidate during the 1999 </p><p>provincial council election.  While the ruling </p><p>technically addresses only the Uva province chief </p><p>minister\'s slot, two other PA-party chief ministers (for </p><p>the Western and the North-Central provinces) were </p><p>selected in the same way that the court ruled against. </p><p>We understand that the Uva chief minister is planning to </p><p>appeal the ruling. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT:  Sri Lanka has seven provincial </p><p>councils, with the PA controlling six of them.  The </p><p>provincial councils and their chief minister positions </p><p>are not very powerful at this time.  That could change, </p><p>especially if the GSL and the Tamil Tigers agree to form </p><p>a semi-autonomous set-up in the north/east, which could </p><p>lead to devolved powers in the rest of the country.  In </p><p>any case, the ruling is a black eye for the PA, which </p><p>controls most of the councils now.  President </p><p>Kumaratunga is said to be upset by the ruling and </p><p>considering next steps.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>==================== </p><p>Death penalty debate </p><p>==================== </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Sri Lanka continues to debate whether to lift a </p><p>long-standing moratorium and re-impose the death </p><p>penalty.  A parliamentary debate recently took place on </p><p>the issue.  The June 5 debate was introduced by eight </p><p>MPs from the ruling UNF who are in favor of bringing the </p><p>death penalty back.  The eight argued that Sri Lanka has </p><p>a law-and-order problem and needs the death penalty as a </p><p>deterrent.  Other UNF members, including Foreign </p><p>Minister Tyronne Fernando, stated their opposition to </p><p>the death penalty.  MPs from the opposition People\'s </p><p>Alliance (PA) also came down on both sides of the issue. </p><p>Regarding President Kumaratunga\'s views, presidential </p><p>spokesman Harim Peiris is quoted as saying the president </p><p>continues to oppose the death penalty. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  Sri Lanka has not had an execution </p><p>since 1976 and it is not likely to have one anytime soon </p><p>in spite of the debate on the issue.  Even if the UNF </p><p>government decides that the death penalty should be </p><p>brought back (and it is not clear where the PM stands on </p><p>the issue), the matter is ultimately in the hands of the </p><p>president, who, per Peiris\' comments, seems dead set </p><p>against re-imposition.  All that said, some in the UNF </p><p>are genuinely worried by rising crime -- and also </p><p>clearly see a lot of political mileage to be gained by </p><p>raising the issue and using it to get at the president. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>============================================ </p><p>Cricket Board election hurts Opposition Star </p><p>============================================ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The June 6 election of officers for Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>national cricket board has hurt the political prospects </p><p>of the Opposition\'s bright new star.  (Note:  The </p><p>technical name of the body is "Board of Control for </p><p>Cricket in Sri Lanka."  The election involved the </p><p>tabulation of votes of members of cricket clubs around </p><p>the country.)  In the election for president of the </p><p>board, Arjuna Ranatunga, an MP for the president\'s </p><p>People\'s Alliance (PA) party, lost the race in decisive </p><p>manner, polling less than five percent of the votes. </p><p>The loss was a bitter defeat for Ranatunga, a well-known </p><p>former cricketeer, who as captain of the team led Sri </p><p>Lanka to the 1996 world championship.  The winner of the </p><p>race, Thilanga Sumathipala, is a businessman, who </p><p>maintains close ties with the governing UNF. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  Cricket is Sri Lanka\'s most popular </p><p>sport, maintaining the combined popularity that our "big </p><p>four" sports -- football, baseball, basketball, ice </p><p>hockey -- have all wrapped into one.  As such, the </p><p>cricket board presidency is a very prestigious job, </p><p>which has been held in the past by powerful politicians, </p><p>including Foreign Minister Tyronne Fernando.  The fact </p><p>that Ranatunga, a protege of President Kumaratunga, lost </p><p>the race in a landslide dulls his political star a bit. </p><p>That said, Ranatunga is good on the hustings and could </p><p>recover a bit of his previous lustre over time.  It is </p><p>not clear whether or not the winner of the race, </p><p>Thilanga Sumathipala, has political ambitions.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>================================ </p><p>Governing Party MPs acting badly </p><p>================================ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) A recent spate of alleged criminal activities </p><p>by parliamentarians has hit the newspapers.  Almost all </p><p>of the cases involve members of the UNF governing </p><p>coalition, although there have been some involving </p><p>members of other parties.  Recent incidents include: </p><p> </p><p>--  On June 6, Minister of Fisheries Mahinda Wijesekara </p><p>is alleged to have publicly threatened a reporter who </p><p>wrote a negative article about the minister some 18 </p><p>months ago.  The incident allegedly took place at a local </p><p>restaurant.  Wijesekara, with a bit of a wink and a nod, </p><p>has repeatedly denied threatening the reporter. </p><p> </p><p>--  June 1 newspaper reports accused Minister of State </p><p>Transport Upali Piyasoma with assisting visa fraud. </p><p>Piyasoma was accused of interfering with his daughter\'s </p><p>effort to obtain a visa to the UK by telling lies about </p><p>her status.  She was ultimately refused a visa. </p><p> </p><p>--  On May 25, UNF MP Dulip Wedaarchi fired shots outside </p><p>a wedding reception at a hotel in Colombo.  No one was </p><p>injured in the firing.  Wedaarchi said he was upset and </p><p>decided to shoot off his gun. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) COMMENT:  The prime minister is said to be very </p><p>angry over these reports and has called for his party to </p><p>create a code of conduct for MPs.  A draft code is </p><p>currently being hashed out.  Few people, however, </p><p>believe that the proposed code will put a stop to such </p><p>incidents.  Indeed, if past patterns hold up, some </p><p>observers expect that the incidents will continue to </p><p>pile up the longer the government is in power.  (Note: </p><p>By the end of its time in power in late 2001, the </p><p>previous PA government -- which had already been in </p><p>power for seven years -- was experiencing a recurring </p><p>nightmare of violence-tinged incidents involving MPs. </p><p>These incidents seriously hurt its reputation.)  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
