(C) SUMMARY.  IN AN APRIL 24 MEETING WITH </p><p>AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, GERMAN AMBASSADOR FRITZ FLIMM </p><p>PASSED INFORMATION ABOUT AN ONGOING FARM OCCUPATION </p><p>THAT HAD SEEN UPWARDS OF A THOUSAND SO-CALLED "WAR </p><p>VETERANS" THREATEN A GERMAN NATIONAL AND OTHER FARM </p><p>RESIDENTS WHILE OCCUPYING A LARGE: COMMERCIAL FARM </p><p>NEAR HARARE.  FLIMM THOUGHT IT DEBATABLE WHETHER </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE WANTS A SOLUTION TO THE LAND </p><p>CRISIS, SINCE IT APPEARS TO BE HIS POLITICAL </p><p>CAMPAIGN THEME FOR THE UPCOMING PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION.  IN KEEPING WITH THIS, HE SUSPECTED THE </p><p>UPCOMING CONFERENCE IN LONDON MAY BE DESIGNED TO </p><p>FAIL.  HE ALSO THOUGHT THE EU WOULD OFFER TO SEND </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS, BUT THE FINAL DECISION WILL </p><p>REST WITH THE GOZ WHEN IT CHOOSES WHETHER OR NOT TO </p><p>ACCEPT THE OFFER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AMBASSADOR FLIMM CALLED C)N AMBASSADOR </p><p>MCDONALD TO PASS ALONG INFORMATIC)N ON AN ONGOING </p><p>FARM OCCUPATION NEAR HARARE THAT, BECAUSE THE FARM </p><p>MANAGER WAS BEING HELD AGAINST H]-S WILL, WAS </p><p>GARNERING SIGNIFICANT MEDIA ATTENTION.  HE ALSO </p><p>SOUGHT A READOUT ON THE RECENT S/E WOLPE VISIT. </p><p>DCM AND TDY POLOFF (NOTETAKER) ALSO ATTENDED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) FLIMM HAD BEEN IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02230  01 OF 02  261126Z </p><p>FARM MANAGER DURING THE OCCUPATION BECAUSE THE </p><p>OWNER IS A GERMAN NATIONAL.  HE SAID THE SITUATION </p><p>ON THE 20,000 HECTARE FARM (THE LARGEST TOBACCO </p><p>FARM IN THE COUNTRY) HAD DEVELOPED ON THE MORNING </p><p>OF APRIL 23, WHEN THE RESIDENT MANAGER HAD CALLED </p><p>FOR ASSISTANCE WHEN HE SAW TWO COLUMNS OF FARM </p><p>OCCUPIERS APPROACHING THE MAIN PROPERTY.  THEY WERE </p><p>USING EQUIPMENT THEY HAD STOLEN FROM NEARBY </p><p>OCCUPIED FARMS AS TRANSPORTATION.  AT THE HEIGHT OF </p><p>THE OCCUPATION, ABOUT 1,000 SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS </p><p>WERE PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE FARM MANAGER ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT HALF </p><p>OF THE OCCUPIERS WERE NOT PARTICIPATING </p><p>VOLUNTARILY.  HE ALSO THOUGHT THAT MOST OF THEM </p><p>WERE NOT FROM THE AREA AROUND THE FARM, BUT HAD </p><p>INSTEAD COME FROM THE NORTHERN REGION OF ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AMBASSADOR FLIMM AND THE FARM MANAGER HAD </p><p>BEEN CONFIDENT THE OCCUPATION WOULD NOT BE A MAJOR </p><p>WORRY BECAUSE THE AMBASSADOR HAD PREVIOUS </p><p>ASSURANCES FROM MASHONALAND CENTRAL PROVINCIAL </p><p>GOVERNOR AND ZANU-PF HEAVYWEIGHT BORDER GEZI THAT </p><p>IT WOULD BE PEACEFUL.  WHEN THE OCCUPATION TURNED </p><p>VIOLENT AND THE MANAGER AND OTHER FARM RESIDENTS </p><p>WERE BEING THREATENED, AMBASSADOR FLIMM HAD BEEN </p><p>ABLE TO BRING THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL BY AGAIN </p><p>APPEALING TO GEZI.  IN THE END, THE WAR VETS LEFT A </p><p>TOKEN HANDFUL OF OCCUPIERS ON TH|: FARM AND HAD </p><p>TAKEN ADDITIONAL FARM EQUIPMENT TO TRANSPORT </p><p>THEMSELVES TO OTHER PROPERTIES IN THE AREA. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02230  01 OF 02  261126Z </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) REFLECTING ON THIS OCCUPATION AND THE </p><p>RECENT COURSE OF EVENTS NATIONWIDE, FLIMM OPINED </p><p>THAT IT IS HIGHLY DEBATABLE WHETHER PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE ACTUALLY WANTS A RESOLUTION TO THE LAND </p><p>OCCUPATION CRISIS.  FLIMM SEES THE OCCUPATIONS, THE </p><p>ATTENDANT PUBLICITY, THE INTIMIDATION OF RURAL </p><p>VOTERS, AND MUGABE\'S ABILITY TO  PROJECT A TOUGH </p><p>PUBLIC IMAGE, AS ALL PART OF A PACKAGE THAT MUGABE, </p><p>FOR NOW AT LEAST, FINDS TO HIS LIKING.  IN ESSENCE, </p><p>THE CRISIS HAS BEEN AN ELECTION PLOY BY MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) FLIMM THOUGHT IT LIKELY THAT MUGABE INTENDS </p><p>FOR THE COMING LONDON CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN A </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN MINISTERIAL TROIKA AND BRITAIN TO FAIL. </p><p>AS FLIMM SEES IT, A WASHOUT AT THE LONDON </p><p>CONFERENCE GIVES MUGABE TWO THINGS: HE CAN CONTINUE </p><p>TO PORTRAY THE BRITISH AS INTRANSIGENT, AND HE </p><p>KEEPS THE FARM OCCUPIERS, WITH THEIR VALUABLE </p><p>POLITICAL MUSCLE, ON THE FARMS WHERE THEY CAN HELP </p><p>DELIVER ZANU-PF VOTES.  IN SHORT, FLIMM THINKS </p><p>MUGABE WANTS TO KEEP UP THE PRESSURE WITH THE </p><p>OBJECTIVE OF SMASHING HIS MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY, </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4013 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02230  02 OF 02  261127Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EUR-01   VC-01    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NEA-00   NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    USIE-00  SA-00    PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------5005B3  261128Z /38 </p><p>R 261130Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5860 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC </p><p>SECDEF WASHINGTON DC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002230 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR AF A/S SUSAN E.

(C) FLIMM ALSO INFORMED THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE </p><p>EU IS IN FAVOR OF SENDING OBSERVE:RS FOR THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  THE EU WILL MAKE THE OFFER </p><p>TO THE GOZ, WHICH WILL THEN HAVE THE FINAL DECISION </p><p>ON WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT THE OBSERVERS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) FLIMM SOUGHT INFORMATION FROM THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ABOUT THE RECENT SERIE:S OF MEETINGS </p><p>BETWEEN THE AMBASSADOR, S/E WOLPE:, AND GOZ </p><p>OFFICIALS INCLUDING MUGABE.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>PROVIDED A READOUT OF THE MEETINGS HE HAD </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN ALONG THE LINES OF REFTEL. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) WE BELIEVE THAT AT THIS TIME, MUGABE HAS </p><p>LITTLE REAL INTEREST IN SOLVING THE LAND CRISIS. </p><p>IT IS, AT BOTTOM, A POLITICAL MOVE HE HAS </p><p>ACQUIESCED IN IF NOT DESIGNED.  T\'HE ABILITY OF </p><p>GOVERNOR GEZI TO TURN OFF VIOLENCE APPARENTLY AT </p><p>WILL IS ANOTHER SIGN, IF ONE WERE NEEDED, THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT CAN INDEED CONTROL THE COURSE OF EVENTS </p><p>HERE WHEN IT SO DESIRES.  MOREOVER, THE PEOPLE </p><p>SUFFERING THE HARD KNOCKS ARE MUGABE\'S POLITICAL </p><p>OPPONENTS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) IT ALSO IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL WE HAVE </p><p>SEEN THAT MUGABE WISHES FOR THE LONDON CONFERENCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02230  02 OF 02  261127Z </p><p>WITH BRITAIN TO FAIL.  SUCCESS WOULD BRING HIM </p><p>INTERNATIONAL APPROBATION, BUT WOULD STYMIE HIM IN </p><p>THE ONE CLEAR COURSE HE HAS CHARTED IN TRYING TO </p><p>APPEAL TO THE ZIMBABWEAN VOTER--AND AT THE MOMENT </p><p>POLITICAL SURVIVAL OUTWEIGHS ALL OTHER CONCERNS FOR </p><p>MUGABE.  IF THE TALKS DO NOT SUCCEED, HE CAN </p><p>CONTINUE TO BLAME OTHERS FOR HIS COUNTRY\'S </p><p>PROBLEMS, RAIL AGAINST THE COLONIAL PAST, AND KEEP </p><p>THE POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE WAR VETERANS OCCUPIED </p><p>WITH A TASK THEY APPARENTLY FIND TO THEIR LIKING. </p><p>IN THE EVENT THE TALKS DO PRODUCE SOME SETTLEMENT, </p><p>MUGABE WILL CROW ABOUT HIS SUCCESS, BUT WE STILL </p><p>WOULD NOT EXPECT TO SEE RAPID PROGRESS ON THE </p><p>GROUND TOWARD PACIFYING THE FARM OCCUPIERS, A MOVE </p><p>THAT WOULD REQUIRE HIM TO THINK OF A NEW ELECTION </p><p>STRATEGY.  END COMMENT. </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
