<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000768 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI, SADC </p><p>SUBJECT: TSVANGIRAI WELCOMES MULUZI INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 767 B) STATE 98702 C) PRETORIA 2012 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: In an April 17 conversation with the Ambassador, </p><p>Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai </p><p>welcomed the initiative by President Muluzi to encourage </p><p>political dialogue in Zimbabwe and expressed hope that it </p><p>might help forestall further mass action -- and its </p><p>unpredictable consequences -- planned by the MDC.  He said </p><p>Muluzi should facilitate talks between ZANU-PF and the MDC </p><p>while leaving substantive details of potential agreements to </p><p>the two parties.  The MDC leader enouraged the USG to make it </p><p>clear to the Zimbabwean armed forces that we would not accept </p><p>military intervention in favor of any one political party. </p><p>The Ambassador once again expressed concern about reports </p><p>that individuals are planning violence and claiming senior </p><p>MDC endorsement of their activities.  Tsvangirai promised to </p><p>make clear the MDC\'s opposition to violence internally and to </p><p>consider issuing a statement condemning violence as a means </p><p>of achieving political change and anyone advocating such an </p><p>approach in the name of the MDC.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Ambassador met on April 17 to deliver points in </p><p>reftel B to Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) President </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai. He emphasized that the USG sees the </p><p>upcoming April 24 visit by Presidents Muluzi and Mbeki as a </p><p>potentially constructive development that could lead to an </p><p>interim coalition government.  He stressed our view that any </p><p>agreement resulting from this initiative should provide for </p><p>President Mugabe\'s departure; restore the rule of law; </p><p>provide a legitimate role for the MDC and prevent domination </p><p>by ZANU-PF in an interim government; and pave the way for </p><p>new, free and fair elections.  The Ambassador indicated that </p><p>we were prepared to be helpful in this effort, by offering </p><p>incentives or maintaining international pressure.  He asked </p><p>whether Tsvangirai agreed that an interim coalition would </p><p>represent a useful way forward.  Tsvangirai confirmed that </p><p>our conditions reflected MDC views on how a transition might </p><p>proceed. </p><p> </p><p>Muluzi involvement "positive" </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Tsvangirai said the Malawian High Commission in </p><p>Harare had been in touch with him to arrange a meeting with </p><p>President Muluzi.  He was not aware of President Mbeki\'s </p><p>plans to attend, but said Mbeki\'s participation would be </p><p>welcome. (Note: We later confirmed that the South African </p><p>High Commissioner here is aware of Mbeki\'s planned </p><p>participation and will head to South Africa on April 18 to </p><p>consult on the visit.  End Note.)  Tsvangirai described the </p><p>Muluzi initiative as a positive development which could help </p><p>avoid looming confrontation in Zimbabwe, and said it was </p><p>consistent with the three-phased solution long advocated by </p><p>the MDC.  First, Mugabe\'s departure was a necessary first </p><p>step which would reduce tensions between the parties and </p><p>increase the chances for a serious negotiation.  Second, an </p><p>interim period was essential, during which time a number of </p><p>confidence-building measures would be implemented, laying the </p><p>groundwork for an environment conducive to a free and fair </p><p>election.  The last phase would be a new election held under </p><p>international supervision. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Ambassador noted that Muluzi had told us he had </p><p>some concerns about the MDC\'s receptiveness to his </p><p>engagement.  If Tsvangirai considered Muluzi\'s involvement </p><p>positive, it was important for him to encourage the Malawian </p><p>president in his efforts.  Tsvangirai said he had done so via </p><p>the Malawian High Commission.  Mugabe, he reported, was </p><p>trying to "throw a spanner" into the Muluzi visit, dictating </p><p>when and where the SADC heads of state could meet with </p><p>Tsvangirai.  Tsvangirai underscored that they preferred </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Muluzi to be a "facilitator" rather than a "negotiator," </p><p>finding a way to engage the two sides in direct talks but not </p><p>focusing on substance.  Any substantive details regarding the </p><p>way forward should be addressed by the two parties during the </p><p>dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>MDC negotiating position getting stronger </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Tsvangirai said he hoped Muluzi could convince </p><p>ZANU-PF to engage in serious talks, as he preferred the route </p><p>of dialogue to a sustained nationwide mass action whose </p><p>outcome was unpredictable.  He noted that the longer ZANU-PF </p><p>continues its repression and the longer the economic decline </p><p>continued, reconciliation would become increasingly hard to </p><p>achieve.  ZANU-PF\'s negotiating position was weakening by the </p><p>day, he said, while the MDC\'s was getting stronger.  The </p><p>Ambassador cautioned against allowing overconfidence to </p><p>preclude a willingness to talk to the other side, and </p><p>Tsvangirai agreed.  Asked how the U.S. could be helpful, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Tsvangirai replied that, although there was no need for a </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>USG-led Baghdad-like intervention in Zimbabwe, after Iraq the </p><p>USG was now better placed to exert pressure on the regime in </p><p>Harare.  The MDC leader urged the Ambassador to make it clear </p><p>to Zimbabwe Defense Forces Chief General Zvinavashe that the </p><p>United States would consider unacceptable any military </p><p>intervention in support of any one political party.  The </p><p>Ambassador agreed to look for ways to make that point. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  We briefed Tsvangirai on ZANU-PF spokesman Nathan </p><p>Shamuyarira\'s remarks to us regarding Mugabe\'s willingness to </p><p>retire (ref A).  Tsvangirai found it interesting that Mugabe </p><p>may be prepared to leave office early, although the MDC finds </p><p>an interim transitional arrangement more appealing than an </p><p>immediate election. </p><p> </p><p>MDC Violence </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The Ambassador revealed that we continue to hear </p><p>reports of MDC-associated individuals planning violence, </p><p>claiming party endorsement for their activities, and said the </p><p>USG might be forced to distance itself from the party if such </p><p>activities occurred.  The Government of Zimbabwe believes it </p><p>has firm evidence of the opposition party\'s instigation of </p><p>some of the violence during the mid-March stayaway.  The </p><p>Ambassador added that four people had approached our embassy </p><p>in Pretoria on April 16 (ref B) claiming they had </p><p>authorization from the highest levels of the MDC to carry out </p><p>violent attacks, and he provided Tsvangirai with their names. </p><p> Tsvangirai looked at their names, appeared not to recognize </p><p>them, and undertook to look into their allegations and get </p><p>back to us with a response.  Tsvangirai stated that he is </p><p>planning to make remarks at an upcoming celebration of the </p><p>party\'s recent parliamentary by-election victories strongly </p><p>criticizing anyone advocating violence in the MDC\'s name. </p><p>Encouraged by the Ambassador to issue a public statement with </p><p>the same message, Tsvangirai agreed to consider this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
