<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001843 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, TH, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: THAI AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ PROVIDES MORE </p><p>INFORMATION ON SITUATION IN BAGHDAD </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 1581 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) On March 26, Thai Ambassador to Iraq (also accredited </p><p>to Jordan) Tawatchai Piyarat (please protect) invited A/DCM </p><p>and A/Pol to his temporary Amman residence to discuss ongoing </p><p>events in Iraq.  Piyarat said that he was speaking in a </p><p>personal capacity and not on instructions from Bangkok, and </p><p>was motivated to provide any help he could "to end the war </p><p>quickly and end the suffering of the Iraqi people." (Note: </p><p>Piyarat had earlier provided us the information contained </p><p>reftel.) </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Piyarat began by noting that the Iraqis are "tough, </p><p>smart, and will fight you with all they\'ve got."  He noted </p><p>that before he departed Baghdad on 3/11, he saw Baath party </p><p>officials distributing weapons to party members and other </p><p>Saddam loyalists.  Such tenacity notwithstanding, he offered </p><p>the following observations to help coalition military </p><p>personnel define targets: </p><p> </p><p>-- Every Mukhabarat building has a pole with red and white </p><p>stripes.  He noted that care must be taken as many of these </p><p>buildings are co-located in residential areas (the </p><p>Mukhabarat\'s HQ -- long since relocated to a building near </p><p>the UNDP HQ -- is only 30 meters from the official Thai </p><p>residence.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Iraqi Generals and senior officials drive white Mercedes </p><p>320S sedans.  Government vehicles have blue license plates, </p><p>however GOI officials drive in regular white plated vehicles </p><p>as well making identification difficult. </p><p> </p><p>-- Many senior Iraqi officials have homes near the park by </p><p>the Parade Grounds (where the large crossed swords monument </p><p>is located).  Most of these officials have moved out of their </p><p>residences and have commandeered buildings along the river </p><p> </p><p>-- There are many underground roadways in Baghdad.  He says </p><p>that Thai workers have told him of being blindfolded, put on </p><p>a bus, and then arriving at an underground construction site </p><p>where they would labor in six month rotations.  He noted </p><p>specifically that under the garden and "pool" of the palace </p><p>beside Saddam tower is an underground roadway.  Piyarat did </p><p>not specify where the road went or what its use is but </p><p>offered that "perhaps another \'bunker buster\' can finish it </p><p>off." (DAO Comment: This reporting is similar to reports of </p><p>Chinese laborers working on underground facilities in the </p><p>1990s.) </p><p> </p><p>-- In attacking Baghdad, the U.S. should consider attacking </p><p>or gaining access to the city by using the river: "they </p><p>expect you to come by land or by air, but not by water." </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Piyarat offered the following additional thoughts on a </p><p>range of topics. </p><p> </p><p>-- Iraq\'s strategy: Piyarat assessed that "they will lure you </p><p>into Baghdad and then take down a lot of people with them." </p><p> </p><p>-- WMD labs: He has no doubt they exist, but the Iraqis have </p><p>been very smart in breaking down individual factories into </p><p>very small units, each of which produces only a small part of </p><p>the overall item. </p><p> </p><p>-- The average Iraqi\'s psychological state:  Among the </p><p>younger people "they\'ve created a generation of hatred, they </p><p>hate America" but among older Iraqis a reservoir of good </p><p>feelings about America still exists.  "Its about 50/50." (DAO </p><p>Comment: Past DAO reporting has indicated a similar </p><p>generational divide in Iraq regarding attitudes toward the </p><p>U.S.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Radio/TV: Iraqis listen to Iranian radio and watch Iranian </p><p>TV, both of which they can receive well in Baghdad.  He </p><p>suggested that the coalition should take out Iraqi TV as soon </p><p>as possible.  Saddam uses that to "create instant casualties" </p><p>whenever he wants.  Piyarat suggested that an area in the </p><p>desert west of Baghdad would be a good place to locate radio </p><p>or TV transmitters that could reach Baghdadis. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Power of Giving:  As a final observation, Piyarat </p><p>commented on how much of Saddam\'s power derives from favors </p><p>which he can provide or deny:  "When Saddam gives, he\'s good. </p><p> When he doesn\'t give, he\'s bad.  That\'s the way it is." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
