<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L LAGOS 000673 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y -- PARAGRAPH MARKINGS ADDED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, KDEM, NI, PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH NLC TO DISCUSS </p><p>UNION PLANS TO STRIKE ON APRIL 1 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador Jeter met with the Acting President of the </p><p>National Labour Congress (NLC), Joseph Akinlaja, on Thursday, </p><p>March 27, 2003, to discuss, inter alia, NLC plans to begin a </p><p>nationwide civil service strike on April 1.  Akinlaja, who is </p><p>also General Secretary of the National Union of Petroleum and </p><p>Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), issued a 14-day ultimatum to </p><p>the GON on March 13 to either implement a September 2002 </p><p>agreement to increase government salaries by 12.5 percent or </p><p>face a nationwide indefinite strike by Nigeria\'s civil </p><p>servants.  The decision to call the strike was made while NLC </p><p>President Adams Oshiomhole was in Geneva attending an </p><p>International Labor Organization conference.  Oshiomhole </p><p>returned to Nigeria on March 30. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During the meeting, the Ambassador emphasized the </p><p>importance of peaceful, transparent elections as the nation </p><p>moves toward its first successful civilian-to-civilian </p><p>transition. He expressed concern that a strike could increase </p><p>tensions in an already volatile environment, adding that </p><p>whatever happens in Nigeria will affect the rest of West </p><p>Africa.  Akinlaja explained that GON mismanagement created </p><p>the dispute; although the NLC tried to remain flexible in the </p><p>interest of moving democracy forward, workers were no longer </p><p>willing to make unnecessary sacrifices.  He dismissed claims </p><p>that the GON could not afford the increase and stated that </p><p>state governments were consulted when the decision was made </p><p>to reduce the salary increase from 25 percent to 12.5 percent </p><p>since many states are already behind in paying their civil </p><p>servants.  Akinlaja assured the Ambassador that despite </p><p>growing unhappiness among workers the NLC favors peace.  As </p><p>many as 4000 NLC members will register to serve as election </p><p>monitors; this fact is clear evidence, Akinlaja said, of the </p><p>NLC\'s commitment to lead Nigeria toward free and fair </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Laboff spoke to Akinlaja on Monday, March 31, as the NLC </p><p>finalized plans for the April 1 strike.  Akinlaja said the </p><p>NLC would not call off the strike unless the GON reopens </p><p>negotiations before midnight on March 31.  If the GON does </p><p>not respond by midnight, civil servants will begin a </p><p>three-day warning strike.  NLC leaders are meeting today to </p><p>plan their next steps if the issue is not resolved by April </p><p>4.  Akinlaja said that after the three-day warning strike the </p><p>NLC could suspend further action until after the elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Although Oshiomhole returned to Nigeria only </p><p>three days before the scheduled strike, he should still have </p><p>enough time to work with President Obasanjo to defuse this </p><p>impending strike action.  Oshiomhole has little to gain from </p><p>a major labor crisis two weeks before the elections. While a </p><p>three-day warning strike or symbolic protest is likely, a </p><p>disruptive strike could exacerbate tensions and lead to </p><p>accusations that the NLC, which has championed preservation </p><p>of democracy, is purposely trying to sabotage the process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Obasanjo may approve the increase only if he thinks the </p><p>issue will derail the elections.  However, a GON-approved pay </p><p>raise that state governments could not fund could be more </p><p>destabilizing.  We therefore think that Oshiomhole will press </p><p>for a solution that does not compromise his credibility </p><p>within the NLC.  While a symbolic or three-day warning strike </p><p>is probable, Oshiomhole will likely play up labor\'s </p><p>commitment to free and fair elections in order to convince </p><p>NLC members to postpone further action related to the 12.5 </p><p>percent increase until after the post-election transition in </p><p>May. Oshiomhole may argue that as a quid pro quo for the </p><p>NLC\'s deferring the strike, Obasanjo should agree to pay </p><p>salary arrears and incremental salary increases until the </p><p>12.5 percent agreement is fully implemented.  End Comment. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
