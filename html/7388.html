The DART APU met with the leadership of the CA </p><p>Brigade responsible for public security in Iraq, and with </p><p>representatives of the Free Iraqi Forces in separate </p><p>meetings.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>DART UPDATES FROM UMM QASR </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The DART met with the newly established town council in </p><p>Umm Qasr with the aim of assisting them in taking up their </p><p>new responsibilities on 9 April.  During the meeting, the </p><p>supply of office equipment, repair of the partially damaged </p><p>town hall, and assistance to the council in spreading a </p><p>message of stability and peace were discussed.  The DART </p><p>will hold a follow-up meeting with the council on 12 April. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  On 10 April, the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) will hold </p><p>a high-level meeting in Rome to discuss the current food </p><p>pipeline for Iraq, including donor contributions and how the </p><p>Oil for Food (OFF) program, under United Nations Security </p><p>Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1472, may offset certain </p><p>requirements as outlined in the U.N. consolidated appeal. </p><p>WFP staff from Larnaca will meet with WFP Executive Director </p><p>Morris and Deputy Graisse.  The purpose of the meeting will </p><p>be to identify viable OFF contracts, the practicality of </p><p>revalidating those contracts, and getting the food shipped </p><p>within the 45-day timeframe laid out in UNSCR 1472.  WFP </p><p>will determine which commodities under current contracts are </p><p>needed immediately and how to expedite their arrival.  By </p><p>close of business in Rome on 11 April, WFP will finalize an </p><p>official letter to be released to the donors on 14 April </p><p>that will incorporate feasible OFF contracts into the </p><p>pipeline. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Even though UNSCR 1472 has passed, and the clock on the </p><p>45 days began ticking on 28 March, there remain many </p><p>technicalities that must be clarified between the Office for </p><p>Iraq Program (OIP) in New York and WFP.  Until new </p><p>procedures are clarified, the current OFF contracts and </p><p>commodities cannot be assumed by WFP.  WFP must renegotiate </p><p>each contract with the supplier as previous contract details </p><p>are null and void.  Once a contract has been renegotiated, </p><p>WFP must seek approval from OIP and negotiate the amount of </p><p>associated costs that OIP will cover.  WFP associated costs </p><p>will be higher than those negotiated previously with the </p><p>Government of Iraq (GOI), as the GOI staff were responsible </p><p>for internal transport, storage, and milling costs.  The </p><p>UNSCR 45-day timeframe will also limit the number of </p><p>contracts that will be viable.  Finally, Phase XIII of the </p><p>OFF expires on or about 6 June (a new phase begins every six </p><p>months). </p><p> </p><p>5.  WFP program manager, Tarek Elguindi, is arriving in </p><p>Kuwait on 10 April to assume management of the program </p><p>aspects of OFF\'s public distribution system (PDS).  Elguindi </p><p>served as program manager of WFP/Iraq for nine months prior </p><p>to the war.  He is very familiar with the PDS and will move </p><p>into Iraq as soon as security allows.  He will be </p><p>accompanied by three to four junior WFP program managers. </p><p>In addition, WFP\'s Deputy Regional Coordinator and </p><p>Operations, Amer Daoudi, will arrive in Kuwait on 15 April. </p><p>The DART\'s food officer in Larnaca will travel to Kuwait at </p><p>the same time.  Daoudi is coming to Kuwait to clarify </p><p>operational responsibilities of WFP staff in Kuwait and lay </p><p>out the plan for the coming weeks. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WFP will send two consultants to the region to assess </p><p>the feasibility of using rail to transport commodities to </p><p>and inside Iraq.  One will go to Kuwait to check the rail </p><p>between Umm Qasr and Baghdad, while the other will go to </p><p>Syria to check the Syria to Iraq route. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WFP will post a milling expert to Kuwait to assess the </p><p>functionality of the eleven mills in Basrah, Iraq when </p><p>security permits.  Three additional milling experts will </p><p>follow. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>ABUSE PREVENTION UNIT </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  On 7 April, the DART Abuse Prevention Unit (APU) met </p><p>with the leadership of the Civil Affairs (CA) Brigade </p><p>responsible for public security in Iraq.  The Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) also </p><p>participated in the meeting.  All participants stressed the </p><p>importance of strong interaction between the APU, ORHA, and </p><p>CA units operating in Iraq.  The APU also learned about a </p><p>report from one Coalition-controlled village where the </p><p>police stayed on the job and were allowed to keep their </p><p>uniforms and weapons.  At this moment, it is not clear in </p><p>which town this took place, and the APU does not expect this </p><p>to be a trend countrywide.  CA representatives inquired </p><p>about the potential role that the DART health team could </p><p>play in assessing prison conditions throughout the country. </p><p>The APU was also asked to assist in arranging future </p><p>meetings between CA, the DART, and ORHA.  Finally, the CA </p><p>representatives suggested a joint CA/APU assessment in An </p><p>Nasiriyah. </p><p> </p><p>9.  The APU also met with representatives of the Free Iraqi </p><p>Forces (FIF) on 7 April.  FIF offered its assistance in </p><p>identifying potential flashpoints and providing technical </p><p>expertise, including interpretation and liaison services, to </p><p>the APU. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
