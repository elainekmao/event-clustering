<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000547 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/IP/SA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, DSERCC and SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES FOR RSOS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, CASC, CE, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: SRI LANKA DEMONSTRATION ACTIVITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   (U) On March 28, 2003, approximately 2000 people </p><p>     protested the U.S. position on Iraq.  The demonstration was </p><p>     organized by the left-wing JVP political party, but </p><p>     according to the police, principally attended by Sri Lankan </p><p>     Muslims.  The protesters were given permission to congregate </p><p>     no further than a site approximately one kilometer from the </p><p>     Embassy.  The group did, however, exceed the permissible </p><p>     protest area and attempted to march to the Emabassy. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   (U) The police prevented the demonstrators from </p><p>     approaching the Chancery.  As the crowd did not readily </p><p>     respond to police instructions, the police used water </p><p>     cannons and dispensed 15 canisters of tear gas to force the </p><p>     crowd to disperse.  According to the Deputy Inspector </p><p>     General of Police (DIG) present at the scene, one of the </p><p>     canisters did not detonate and was thrown back at the police </p><p>     where the gas was released. The DIG was slightly injured and </p><p>     was taken to a hospital for medical treatment. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   (U) The Embassy also received unconfirmed reports of </p><p>     demonstrations in at least six other locations in the </p><p>     country.  No violence was reported and no reliable numbers </p><p>     are available. </p><p> </p><p>  4.   (U) Post continues to closely monitor demonstration </p><p>     activity - particularly to see if numbers grow and violence </p><p>     begins to permeate. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
