<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 COLOMBO 01041 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, PINR, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  INSIDE THE LTTE:  A LOOK AT THE TIGERS\' </p><p>          COMMAND STRUCTURE AND REGIONAL LEADERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: 86 COLOMBO 6174 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  PRABHAKARAN HAS DIVIDED HIS LIBERATION </p><p>TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM INTO FIVE POLITICO-MILITARY </p><p>REGIONS, EACH COMMANDED BY A REGIONAL LEADER RESPONSIBLE </p><p>TO PRABHAKARAN.  IN TURN THESE REGIONAL COMMANDERS HAVE </p><p>SUBORDINATE AREA COMMANDERS UNDER THEIR CONTROL.  THE </p><p>LTTE STRUCTURE IS A TIGHT PYRAMID, WITH POWER CONCEN- </p><p>TRATED AT THE APEX--PRABHAKARAN.  HIS LIEUTENANT IN </p><p>JAFFNA IS KITTU, WHO SPORTS A LEOPARD-SKIN HOLSTER, </p><p>KEEPS A PET MONKEY, AND IS GENERALLY KNOWN AS </p><p>PRABHAKARAN\'S "ENFORCER."  THE TOP MAN IN MANNAR IS </p><p>RADHA, THE REPUTED LEADER OF THE LTTE RAID ON </p><p>ANURADHAPURA IN 1985 THAT LEFT 150 SINHALESE CIVILIANS </p><p>DEAD.  IN BATTICALOA THE LTTE LEADER IS KUMARAN, A </p><p>WILY GUERRILLA WHO HAS NARROWLY ESCAPED CAPTURE OR </p><p>DEATH TWICE IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS.  GIVEN WHAT WE </p><p>KNOW OF THE LTTE\'S STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS, IF AN </p><p>LTTE-CONTROLLED TAMIL EELAM WERE TO BE ESTABLISHED, </p><p>IT WOULD BE DOMINATED BY PRABHAKARAN, WOULD BE </p><p>HIGHLY CENTRALIZED AND AUTHORITARIAN (ALTHOUGH NOT </p><p>VERY IDEOLOGICAL), AND BE PLAGUED BY CLEAVAGES BASED </p><p>ON REGION, CASTE, AND RELIGION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  INTRODUCTION:  THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL </p><p>EELAM (LTTE) ARE NOW INDISPUTABLY THE PREDOMINANT </p><p>TAMIL SEPARATIST ORGANIZATION, HAVING COWED RIVAL </p><p>MILITANT GROUPS, SUPPLANTED THE MODERATE TULF </p><p>AS THE LEADING POLITICAL LIGHT OF THE TAMIL CAUSE, </p><p>SLIPPED THE BONDS OF INDIAN TUTELAGE, AND ESTABLISHED </p><p>A FUNCTIONING (IF LIMITED) CIVIL ADMINISTRATION IN </p><p>TERRITORY UNDER THEIR CONTROL.  EMBASSY COLOMBO IN </p><p>PAST WEEKS HAS FOCUSED ON THE LTTE POLITICO-MILITARY </p><p>STRUCTURE IN SRI LANKA AND ON THE LOCAL LTTE LEADERS </p><p>WHO OPERATE UNDER PRABHAKARAN\'S DIRECTION IN THE </p><p>NORTH AND EAST.  REFTEL CONTAINS BIOGRAPHIC </p><p>INFORMATION ON THE LTTE LEADER, VELUPILLAI PRABHAKARN, </p><p>WHO RECENTLY RETURNED TO JAFFNA AFTER 3 YEARS OF EXILE </p><p>IN TAMIL NADU.  THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS DESCRIBE THE </p><p>LTTE COMMAND STRUCTURE AND GIVE PROFILES OF SOME </p><p>OF THE LTTE REGIONAL AND SUB-REGIONAL COMMANDERS. </p><p>THIS MESSAGE SEEKS TO PROVIDE A GLIMPSE INSIDE THE LTTE </p><p>AND INFORMATION ON CHARACTERISTIC LOCAL COMMANDERS. </p><p>EMBASSY HAS INFORMATION ON THREE OF THE FIVE REGIONAL </p><p>COMMANDERS AND WILL INFORM ADDRESSEES IF SUBSEQUENT </p><p>DATA ON TRINCOMALEE AND VAVUNIYA LTTE LEADERS COMES </p><p>TO LIGHT.  INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS FROM OPEN, </p><p>PUBLISHED SOURCES, AS WELL AS FROM THE SRI LANKAN </p><p>POLICE, MILITARY, FOREIGN AND SRI LANKAN JOURNALISTS </p><p>WHO HAVE TRAVELED IN THE NORTH AND EAST, AND LOCAL </p><p>PRIVATE CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>4.  LUCKY FIVE; A REGIONAL COMMAND STRUCTURE: </p><p>THE LTTE HAS DIVIDED THE NORTH AND EAST INTO FIVE </p><p>REGIONAL COMMAND STRUCTURES, EACH WITH AN OVERALL </p><p>REGIONAL COMMANDER WHO REPORTS DIRECTLY TO PRABHAKARAN. </p><p>EACH OF THE FIVE REGIONS IS FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO </p><p>SMALLER AREAS, WITH A DESIGNATED LOCAL LEADER WHO </p><p>REPORTS TO THE REGIONAL COMMANDER.  THE FIVE REGIONS </p><p>ARE JAFFNA, MANNAR, VAVUNIYA (COMPRISED OF VAVUNIYA, </p><p>KILINOCHCHI, AND MULLAITTIVU DISTRICTS), TRINCOMALEE, </p><p>AND BATTICALOA (BATTICALOA AND AMPARAI DISTRICTS). </p><p>THE NUMBER FIVE IS CONSIDERED TO BE VERY LUCKY IN </p><p>TAMIL HINDU MYTHOLOGY, AND ONE MILITARY CONTACT SAYS </p><p>PRABHAKARAN SET UP FIVE REGIONAL COMMANDS FOR THIS </p><p>REASON.  THE FIVE REGIONAL COMMANDERS SIT ON THE </p><p>LTTE\'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE, ALONG WITH PRAKHAKARAN AND </p><p>A FEW SELECT OTHERS.  THE REGIONAL COMMANDERS ARE </p><p>CONCURRENTLY MILITARY AND POLITICAL LEADERS; THERE IS </p><p>NO DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE LTTE\'S POLITICAL AND </p><p>MILITARY HIERARCHY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  HIGHLY CENTRALIZED:  THE LTTE OPERATIONAL COMMAND </p><p>STRUCTURE IS HIGHLY CENTRALIZED AND IS DOMINATED BY </p><p>PRABHAKARAN.  JAFFNA PLAYS THE KEY ROLE OVERALL, BOTH </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE LTTE CONTROL AND FREEDOM OF OPERATION </p><p>THERE, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT JAFFNA TAMILS DOMINATE </p><p>THE LTTE\'S RANKS.  THE TIGERS RUN A SOPHISTICATED </p><p>RADIO COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK BETWEEN THE REGIONAL </p><p>COMMANDS AND JAFFNA, A SYSTEM WHICH MANY CLAIM IS A </p><p>PRIMARY REASON FOR THE  LTTE\'S CENTRALIZED COORDINATION, </p><p>DISCIPLINE, AND EFFECTIVENESS.  THE REGIONAL COMMANDERS </p><p>ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN THEIR AUTHORITY BY MEANS OF </p><p>STRICT CONTROL OF ALL MUNITIONS AND SUPPLIES DISTRIBUTED </p><p>THROUGH THE LTTE STRUCTURE. SUB-REGIONAL COMMANDERS HAVE </p><p>GUNS, AMMO, AND OTHER SUPPLIES DOLED OUT TO THEM BY THE </p><p>REGIONAL COMMANDERS.  ONE POLICE CONTACT CLAIMED THAT THE </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL RANSOM COLLECTIONS MADE BY THE LTTE ARE ALL </p><p>IMMEDIATELY SENT BACK TO JAFFNA, FOR LATER DISTRIBUTION </p><p>FOR THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION AS PRABHAKARAN SEES FIT. </p><p>ACCORDING TO A PRESS REPORT, "EVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO </p><p>TAKE AN OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO PRABHAKARAN.  THE REGIONAL </p><p>LEADERS ARE HANDPICKED BY PRABHAKARAN HIMSELF ON THE </p><p>BASIS OF TRUST, LOYALTY, AND EXPERIENCE." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>JAFFNA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>6.  KITTU; MACHO ANIMAL LOVER: </p><p>THE JAFFNA REGION COMMANDER AND REPUTEDLY THE </p><p>SECOND MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE LTTE IS KITTU </p><p>(WHOSE REAL NAME IS SATHASIVAM KRISHNAKUMAR). </p><p>KITTU, 27, IS SAID TO BE A CLOSE RELATIVE OF </p><p>PRABHAKARAN AND IS FROM THE SAME FISHERMAN </p><p>CASTE (KARAYAR) AND HOMETOWN (VALVEDDITURRAI). </p><p>HE IS REPORTED TO SPEAK ONLY TAMIL--ALTHOUGH </p><p>HE MAY UNDERSTAND SOME ENGLISH--AND TO HAVE </p><p>COMPLETED THE "ORDINARY LEVEL" EXAMS (10 YEARS </p><p>OF EDUCATION).  PICTURES HAVE APPEARED IN THE </p><p>COLOMBO PRESS OF KITTU HOLDING HIS PET MONKEY, </p><p>"BILL," AND ONE FOREIGN JOURNALIST WHO INTERVIEWED HIM </p><p>SAID HE WAS CONSTANTLY SURROUNDED BY A PACK OF </p><p>FRIENDLY DOGS.  HE IS A NOTORIOUSLY BAD DRIVER; THE </p><p>JOURNALIST CITED ABOVE CLAIMED KITTU TOOK HIM FOR A </p><p>HAIR-RAISING RIDE AROUND JAFFNA.  GSL REPORTS IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER 1986 THAT KITTU HAD BEEN BADLY WOUNDED </p><p>BY MORTAR FIRE WERE BASED ON THE FACT THAT, ACCORDING </p><p>TO TAMIL SOURCES, KITTU HAD SMASHED UP HIS LEG RATHER </p><p>SERIOUSLY IN AN AUTO WRECK.  RECENT REPORTS FROM JAFFNA </p><p>OF KITTU ZIPPING AROUND ON A SCOOTER INSTEAD OF HIS </p><p>CAR HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO (1) A DEMOTION WITHIN THE </p><p>LTTE HIERARCHY, OR (2) EFFECTS OF THE GSL FUEL EMBARGO </p><p>IN JAFFNA.  IT MAY BE THE CASE, HOWEVER, THAT KITTU </p><p>SIMPLY HAS SMASHED UP HIS CAR ONCE AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  KITTU, DESCRIBED BY ONE JOURNALIST AS LOOKING LIKE </p><p>"AN ECCENTRIC BUT RICH UNDERGRADUATE," ALSO HAS A </p><p>DARKER, TYRANNICAL SIDE.  ONE CONTACT SAID HE HAD A </p><p>"MACHO SWAGGER" AND CARRIES A .45 IN A LEOPARD-SKIN </p><p>HOLSTER (ANOTHER REPORT IDENTIFIES HIS SIDE-ARM AS </p><p>A .357 MAGNUM).  THE JOURNALIST CITED IN PARA 6 </p><p>SAID THAT WHILE ON A TOUR OF THE JAFFNA AREA, KITTU </p><p>WOULD STOP THE CAR, PULL OUT HIS PISTOL, AND BLAST </p><p>AWAY AT CROWS ("HE NEVER HIT ANYTHING," THE JOURNALIST </p><p>ADDED).  HE ALSO REPORTEDLY WEARS A POTASSIUM CYANIDE </p><p>CAPSULE AROUND HIS NECK IN ORDER TO COMMIT SUICIDE IF </p><p>CAPTURED, A PRACTICE COMMON WITH LTTE CADRE.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO A VARIETY OF SOURCES, KITTU  IS RUTHLESS WHEN DEALING </p><p>WITH TAMILS SUSPECTED OF COOPERATING WITH THE GSL; ONE </p><p>INTERVIEWER STATED, "THE HEADMASTER OF A WELL-ESTABLISHED </p><p>JAFFNA SCHOOL WAS KILLED ON KITTU\'S ORDERS FOR THE CRIME </p><p>OF PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH THE ARMY."  (WE ASSUME THIS </p><p>TO REFER TO EDWIN ANANDRAJAM, THE PRINCIPAL OF ST. </p><p>JOHN\'S COLLEGE, WHO WAS SHOT AND KILLED JUNE 26, 1985. </p><p>HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW TOLD POLCOUNS THAT THE LTTE HAD </p><p>EXECUTED HIM FOR HAVING ALLOWED HIS SCHOOL TO PLAY </p><p>AGAINST AN ARMY TEAM.)  A GSL SOURCE, IN COMMENTING </p><p>ON KITTU\'S TEMPER AND VIOLENT NATURE, SAID THAT A </p><p>RECENT MEETING TOOK PLACE AT KITTU\'S HOUSE WITH A </p><p>DOZEN OR SO LTTE CADRE.  MANY OF THE CADRE HAD PARKED </p><p>THEIR BICYCLES OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE, AND WHEN A GSL </p><p>HELICOPTER FLEW OVER THE AREA KITTU ORDERED THE MEN </p><p>TO MOVE THEIR BICYCLES FOR SECURITY REASONS.  WHEN </p><p>HIS ORDERS WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY CARRIED OUT, KITTU </p><p>GOT AN AX, WENT OUTSIDE, AND DEMOLISHED THE BICYCLES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  KITTU\'S POLITICAL LEANINGS ARE NOT WELL KNOWN; IT </p><p>MAY BE THAT BEYOND MILITANT TAMIL NATIONALISM HIS </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL COMMITMENTS ARE THIN.  IN AN AUGUST 1986 </p><p>INTERVIEW WITH JON SWAIN OF THE "SUNDAY TIMES" KITTU </p><p>IS QUOTED AS SAYING, "THE TIGERS ARE REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>SOCIALISTS WHOSE ULTIMATE AIM IS THE CREATION OF A </p><p>ONE-PARTY SOCIALIST STATE." </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE COLOMBO PRESS IN PAST MONTHS HAS PLAYED UP THE </p><p>ALLEGED FALLING OUT BETWEEN KITTU AND PRABHAKARAN. </p><p>NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REPORTED THAT KITTU HAD VANISHED AND </p><p>MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED IN LTTE IN-FIGHTING, CHAFFED AT </p><p>HAVING PRABHAKARAN RETURN TO JAFFNA AFTER KITTU HAD </p><p>BEEN TOP DOG THERE FOR 3 YEARS, AND THAT KITTU WAS TO </p><p>MARRY A TAMIL DOCTOR AND WAS NOW MORE INTERESTED IN </p><p>MAKING LOVE THAN WAR.  MANY OBSERVERS FEEL THAT THE </p><p>KITTU-PRABHAKARAN RIFT WAS EITHER INVENTED BY THE GSL, </p><p>OR MAGNIFIED IN ORDER TO FOSTER THE PERCEPTION THAT </p><p>THE TIGERS WERE GOING TO BE TORN ASUNDER. </p><p> </p><p>10.  RAHIM; TRILINGUAL ARISTOCRAT: </p><p>KITTU\'S PURPORTED NUMBER TWO, INTERPRETER, AND </p><p>JAFFNA REGION LTTE SPOKESMAN IS REPORTEDLY 22 </p><p>YEARS OLD, ALTHOUGH HIS AGE IS OFTEN GIVEN AS 19 BY </p><p>FOREIGN MEDIA.  HIS REAL NAME IS BALASUBRAMANIAM </p><p>CANAGARATNAM.  WHEN THE JULY 1983 COMMUNAL RIOTS </p><p>BROKE OUT, RAHIM WAS A SECONDARY STUDENT AT TRINITY </p><p>COLLEGE IN KANDY.  HIS FATHER WAS A SENIOR PLANTER </p><p>ON A STATE TEA PLANTATION AND EVIDENTLY BORE THE </p><p>BRUNT OF SINHALESE IRE IN THE AREA.  RAHIM IMMEDIATELY </p><p>QUIT SCHOOL AND MOVED TO JAFFNA WITH HIS FAMILY AND </p><p>SHORTLY THEREAFTER JOINED THE LTTE.  RAHIM HAS TWO </p><p>UNCLES WHO ARE WELL-KNOWN SURGEONS, HIS GRANDFATHER </p><p>WAS SRI LANKA\'S AUDITOR-GENERAL, AND THE FAMILY IN </p><p>GENERAL WAS PART OF THE "ASSIMILATED" TAMIL ESTABLISH- </p><p>MENT.  RAHIM, A MEMBER OF A HIGH JAFFNA TAMIL CASTE, </p><p>SPEAKS ENGLISH, TAMIL, AND SINHALA FLUENTLY.  HE </p><p>BECAME SOMEWHAT OF AN ISLAND-WIDE PERSONALITY DURING </p><p>RECENT VISITS TO JAFFNA OF A SINHALESE POLITICIAN WHO </p><p>MADE A VIDEO TAPE OF HIS TRIP WHICH WAS DISTRIBUTED </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  IN THIS VIDEO TAPE RAHIM </p><p>APPEARS AS THE HANDSOME, SLENDER, ARTICULATE LTTE </p><p>SPOKESMAN, IN CONTRAST TO THE PUDGY, BALDING, </p><p>BESPECTACLED, AND MONOLINGUAL KITTU.  RAHIM\'S COMBAT </p><p>EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>BATTICALOA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>11.  KUMARAN:  SIXTH SENSE: </p><p>THE LTTE COMMANDER IN CHARGE OF THE BATTICALOA AND </p><p>AMPARAI DISTRICTS GOES BY THE NOM DE GUERRE KUMARAN </p><p>(OR AT TIMES IS REFERRED TO AS KUMARAPPAN).  WE </p><p>DO NOT KNOW HIS REAL NAME.  HE IS SAID TO BE A </p><p>SUPERB TACTICIAN AND LOGISTICIAN, RUNNING A CLASSIC </p><p>GUERRILLA OPERATION FAR FROM HIS SOURCE OF SUPPLIES </p><p>AND REINFORCEMENTS.  KUMARAN, A HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT, </p><p>WAS RAISED IN BATTICALOA.  HIS MOTHER WAS A BATTICALOA </p><p>TAMIL, WHILE HIS FATHER WAS FROM JAFFNA, THUS MAKING </p><p>HIM ACCEPTABLE TO THE BATTICALOA CADRES AS WELL AS THE </p><p>JAFFNA-DOMINATED CENTRAL STRUCTURE.  ON A NUMBER OF </p><p>OCCASIONS HE HAS BARELY AVOIDED CAPTURE OR DEATH.  ONE </p><p>SERIOR GSL SECURITY OFFICER TOLD POLOFF OF AN AMBUSH </p><p>SET SPECIFICALLY TO KILL KUMARAN.  THE AUTHORITIES </p><p>LEARNED THAT KUMARAN WAS PERSONALLY TO COME COLLECT </p><p>A KIDNAPPING RANSOM FROM A TAMIL FAMILY OUTSIDE OF </p><p>BATTICALOA.  THE FAMILY COOPERATED WITH THE GSL, WHO </p><p>SET UP AN AMBUSH SITE ON THE ROAD TO THE FAMILY\'S HOUSE. </p><p>KUMARAN AND ANOTHER MAN CAME DOWN THE ROAD ON A MOTOR- </p><p>CYCLE TOWARD THE AMBUSH, WHEN FOR NO APPARENT REASON </p><p>KUMARAN STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, GOT OFF, LOOKED DOWN </p><p>THE ROAD, AND THEN TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK THE </p><p>WAY HE HAD COME.  THE SECURITY OFFICER SAID, "I DON\'T </p><p>KNOW HOW HE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY SPOTTED THE AMBUSH-- </p><p>HE MUST HAVE SOME SIXTH SENSE."  HE ALSO NARROWLY ESCAPED </p><p>THE STF DURING A LATE JANUARY RAID ON AN LTTE BASE CAMP </p><p>IN BATTICALOA.  THE TROOPS REPORTEDLY MANAGED TO CAPTURE </p><p>HIS COMMAND VEHICLE IN THE RAID--A 4-WHEEL DRIVE CAMOU- </p><p>FLAGED PICKUP WITH THE WORD "BEIRUT" STENCILED ACROSS </p><p>THE HOOD. </p><p> </p><p>12.  DAVID; POLICE BARBER\'S SON: </p><p>KUMARAN\'S SUBORDINATE IN CHARGE OF SOUTHERN BATTICALOA </p><p>DISTRICT AND NORTHERN AMPARAI DISTRICT IS DAVID (REAL </p><p>NAME NOT KNOWN TO US),  THE SON OF A BARBER FROM POTUVIL </p><p>IN AMPARAI DISTRICT WHO REGULARLY SERVED AS THE POLICE </p><p>BARBER IN THE AREA.  THE COMMANDANT OF THE STF TOLD </p><p>POLOFF IN AUGUST 1986 THAT DAVID HAD A BAND OF 12 TO 15 </p><p>MEN WHO OPERATED IN SOME OF THE LEAST ACCESSIBLE JUNGLES </p><p>ON THE ISLAND.  THE COMMANDANT STATED THAT THE TROOPS </p><p>HAVE FREQUENTLY ZEROED IN ON DAVID\'S RADIO COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>BUT HAVE NEVER MANAGED TO RESPOND QUICKLY ENOUGH TO NAB </p><p>THE GUERRILLA BAND.  THE REPORTED MASSACRE OF SOME 40 </p><p>SINHALESE CIVILIANS IN FEBRUARY 1987 OCCURRED IN THE </p><p>AREA OF DAVID\'S COMMAND, BUT IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER HE </p><p>LED OR DIRECTED THE KILLINGS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>MANNAR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>13.  RADHA; BUTCHER OF ANURADHAPURA: </p><p>THE MANNAR REGIONAL COMMANDER, RADHA (REAL NAME, </p><p>ANTHONY KATHTHIAR), IS A HIGH-CASTE HINDU FROM </p><p>ARIALAI IN THE JAFFNA PENINSULA.  APPROXIMATELY </p><p>24 YEARS OLD, HE ASSUMED THE MANNAR COMMAND IN </p><p>OCTOBER 1986 FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF VICTOR, THE </p><p>POPULAR MANNAR COMMANDER.  VICTOR, A CATHOLIC </p><p>FROM MANNAR (CATHOLICS CONSTITUTE 42 PERCENT OF </p><p>MANNAR DISTRICT\'S POPULATION, HINDUS 25 PERCENT </p><p>AND THE REMAINDER ARE MUSLIM)  HAD A STRONG PERSONAL </p><p>FOLLOWING AMONG THE LTTE FIGHTERS IN MANNAR.  WHEN </p><p>PRABHAKARAN CHOSE A JAFFNA HINDU TO REPLACE HIM, </p><p>A NUMBER OF LTTE MEMBERS TRIED TO RESIGN.  PRABHAKARAN </p><p>ALLEGEDLY DISPATCHED KITTU TO REMIND THE DISAFFECTED </p><p>MANNAR "BOYS" THAT NOBODY RESIGNS FROM THE LTTE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO A MILITARY SOURCE, THE LTTE HAS UNDER- </p><p>TAKEN NO OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS EXCEPT FOR THREE LAND- </p><p>MINE EXPLOSIONS IN MANNAR DISTRICT SINCE RADHA REPLACED </p><p>VICTOR IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR.  THE OFFICER ADDED </p><p>THAT IT WAS RADHA, THEN WORKING UNDER VICTOR\'S COMMAND, </p><p>WHO ORGANIZED AND EXECUTED THE ATTACK IN MAY 1985 ON </p><p>THE HOLY BUDDHIST TOWN OF ANURADHAPURA IN WHICH OVER </p><p>150 CIVILIANS WERE KILLED.  RADHA REPORTEDLY SPENDS </p><p>A GOOD DEAL OF TIME IN VALVEDDITTURAI ON THE JAFFNA </p><p>PENINSULA.  BEFORE ASSUMING THE MANNAR COMMAND </p><p>HE WAS IN SOUTH INDIA FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD, IN </p><p>CHARGE OF TRAINING THE "FOURTH BATCH" OF LTTE RECRUITS. </p><p> </p><p>14.  SHAHJAHAN; MANNAR DANDY: </p><p>RAHDA\'S DEPUTY IS SHAHJAHAN, A LOCAL FROM MANNAR DISTRICT </p><p>WHO HAS TAKEN VICTOR\'S PLACE AS THE POPULAR FAVORITE </p><p>AMONG LTTE SUPPORTERS IN MANNAR.  HE IS REFERRED TO AS </p><p>"THE INDIAN MOVIE STAR" BOTH BECAUSE OF HIS NOM DE </p><p>GUERRE AND DASHING GOOD LOOKS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  SALIM; CORRUPT COMMISSAR: </p><p>SALIM, ANOTHER LEADER IN THE MANNAR LTTE STRUCTURE, HAS </p><p>BEEN TASKED WITH ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS SUCH AS "TAX </p><p>COLLECTION," MAGISTERIAL DUTIES, PROPAGANDA EFFORTS, ETC. </p><p>ACCORDING TO ONE SOURCE, RADHA HAS COMPLAINED TO PRABHAK- </p><p>ARAN THAT SALIM IS EMBEZZLING FUNDS AND IS GENERATING </p><p>POPULAR RESENTMENT IN THE AREA AGAINST THE LTTE.  IF </p><p>TRUE, SALIM\'S TENURE IS LIKELY TO BE SHORT-LIVED, ACCORD- </p><p>ING TO THIS REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>CONCLUSIONS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>16.  THE PRIMACY OF VELUPILLAI PRABHAKARAN IN NEARLY </p><p>EVERY ASPECT OF THE LTTE\'S ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES-- </p><p>BE IT APPOINTING REGIONAL COMMANDERS, DIVYING UP </p><p>RANSOM MONEY, DECIDING ON THE QUANTITIES OF MUNITIONS </p><p>AND SUPPPLIES FOR THE VARIOUS REGIONS, ETC.--BECAME </p><p>QUICKLY APPARENT AS WE LOOKED AT THE LTTE\'S FUNCTIONING </p><p>STRUCTURE IN SRI LANKA.  IF PRABHAKARAN WERE TO LEAVE </p><p>THE SCENE FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN </p><p>TO THE LTTE?  KITTU IS BEST PLACED TO TAKE OVER THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION, BEING THE COMMANDER OF THE MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>REGION AND GENERALLY  RECOGNIZED AS PRABHAKARAN\'S </p><p>DEPUTY.  HOWEVER, IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR IF KITTU </p><p>HAS THE PERSONAL AND/OR ORGANIZATIONAL AUTHORITY TO </p><p>DICTATE TO THE ORGANIZATION AS PRABHAKARAN THUS FAR HAS </p><p>BEEN ABLE TO.  THE IRON DISCIPLINE AND EFFECTIVE </p><p>COORDINATION OF THE LTTE, ONE KEY TO THE TIGERS\' </p><p>SUCCESSES SO FAR, WOULD PROBABLY BE WEAKENED IN A POST- </p><p>PRABHAKARAN POWER STRUGGLE. </p><p> </p><p>17.  IF THE CURRENT POLITICO-MILITARY "MANAGEMENT STYLE" </p><p>OF THE LTTE COMMAND STRUCTURE IS ANY INDICATION (AND </p><p>WE BELIEVE IT IS), THEN IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT OF THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF AN LTTE-CONTROLLED TAMIL EELAM WE WOULD </p><p>MOST LIKELY SEE AN AUTHORITARIAN, HEAVILY CENTRALIZED </p><p>ADMINISTRATION.  THE REGIME IS APT TO BE A MILITARY </p><p>DICTATORSHIP IN THE GUISE OF A (REHETORICALLY) SOCIALIST </p><p>ONE-PARTY SYSTEM, BEING NEITHER PARTICULARLY BENEVOLENT </p><p>NOR IDEOLOGICAL.  A MORE LIEKLY PROSPECT IS THAT </p><p>PRABHAKARAN COULD BECOME THE NORTHERN PROVINCE CHIEF </p><p>MINISTER UNDER SOME DEVOLUTION SCHEME.  UNDER THIS </p><p>SETUP HIS AUTHORITARIAN TENDENCIES WOULD PROBABLY BE </p><p>ATTENUATED TO SOME DEGREE BY THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM </p><p>OUTLINED IN THE GSL\'S PROVINCIAL COUNCIL PROPOSALS. </p><p> </p><p>18.  CLEAVAGES ALREADY VISIBLE WITHIN THE LTTE WOULD BE </p><p>EXACERBATED IN THE EVENT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TAMIL </p><p>EELAM UNDER LTTE CONTROL.  DOMINATION BY LOW- AND MIDDLE- </p><p>CAST HINDUS FROM JAFFNA, CURRENTLY THE CORE OF LTTE POWER </p><p>WOULD  RANKLE MANY TAMILS, ONCE "DOMINATION" BY THE </p><p>SINHALESE BUDDHISTS WERE THROWN OFF.  RIFTS WOULD LIKELY </p><p>APPEAR BETWEEN JAFFNA--NON-JAFFNA TAMILS, HINDUS-- </p><p>CHRISTIANS, BETWEEN CASTE GROUPINGS, EASTERNERS- </p><p>NORTHERNERS, ETC.  THE NONDEMOCRATIC INCLINATION OF </p><p>PRABHAKARAN WOULD LEAVE LITTLE OR NO  OUTLET FOR </p><p>DISSENT BASED ON THESE CLEAVAGES.  IN SHORT, AN </p><p>LTTE-CONTROLLED TAMIL EELAM WOULD LIKELY BE AN </p><p>UNHAPPY PLACE FOR MANY TAMILS, EVEN MANY OF THOSE </p><p>SUPPORTIVE OF THE SEPARATIST MOVEMENT TODAY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SPAIN </p><p></p></div>
