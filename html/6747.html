<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000609 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IZ, PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Bush, Blair are villains" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily Chronicle" called </p><p>      for broadcast of "more gory pictures of </p><p>      mutilated British and American soldiers on our </p><p>      television screens," in its March 25 editorial. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .We wish to see more gory pictures of </p><p>      mutilated British and American soldiers on our </p><p>      television screens.  This will serve as a lesson to </p><p>      those who believe that they can control the world and </p><p>      bully everybody.  It is disappointing that the world </p><p>      has stood by and let George Bush and his partner in </p><p>      crime, Tony Blair, kill innocent civilians under the </p><p>      guise of promoting democracy. . .  We will not support </p><p>      the bullying of smaller nations by those who believe </p><p>      that they can police the world. . .  We are relieved </p><p>      that there are reports that the U.S.-led forces face </p><p>      fiercer-than-expected resistance, quashing hopes of a </p><p>      swift victory. . .  We urge the immediate resignation </p><p>      of Tony Blair and George bush for crimes of war and </p><p>      crimes against humanity." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Comment: This editorial, truly sick even by the </p><p>      Chronicle\'s notoriously low standards, contrast </p><p>      harshly to the Zimbabwean information minister\'s </p><p>      locally ballyhooed March 24 complaint that western </p><p>      media coverage of Iraq abuses ethical and audience </p><p>      standards by showing violent images. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
