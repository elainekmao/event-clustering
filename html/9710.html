Under headline "U. S. shows unparalleled savagery, </p><p>      contempt for human life" the July 28 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" carried the </p><p>      following article by Barry Grey, in which he </p><p>      criticizes the American Government for sanctioning </p><p>      the emblazoning of the corpses of Saddam Hussein\'s </p><p>      two sons, Uday and Qusay.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The world was subjected to a gruesome and barbaric </p><p>      spectacle on Thursday when the Bush administration </p><p>      released photographs of the mutilated corpses of </p><p>      Saddam Hussein\'s sons, Uday and Qusay, ambushed and </p><p>      killed by American forces on July 22. . .The </p><p>      overwhelming majority of people around the world, </p><p>      and especially in the U. S., will feel only </p><p>      revulsion and shame at this exhibition of sadism. </p><p>      Whatever one thinks of the deposed Iraqi ruler and </p><p>      his sons. . .the actions of the Bush administration </p><p>      in slaughtering Uday and Qusay Hussein and then </p><p>      gloating over their dead bodies demonstrate that the </p><p>      U. S. ruling elite has nothing to learn from its </p><p>      enemies when it comes to savagery and contempt for </p><p>      human life. . .The fact that those who wield power </p><p>      in Washington are blind to the mass revulsion that </p><p>      will arise in response to the showing of these </p><p>      photos highlights the insular and degenerate </p><p>      character of the American ruling elite.  These </p><p>      traits are concentrated in the man who sits atop the </p><p>      government.  The political calculations of Bush and </p><p>      his associates. . .are of the most crude and </p><p>      backward sort.  It is no exaggeration to say they </p><p>      reflect a criminal mentality.  Bush\'s inner circle </p><p>      was intimately involved in the decision to massacre </p><p>      the Hussein sons and release the photos of their </p><p>      corpses. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
