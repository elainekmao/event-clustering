<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 271057 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS, MCAP, PREL, US, XF, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT:  STAYING THE COURSE IN THE PERSIAN GULF </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  WITH THE APPROACH OF THE FORMAL CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN </p><p>IRAN AND IRAQ ON AUGUST 20, SOME ARE SUGGESTING THAT THE </p><p>U.S. HAS ALREADY DECIDED TO BEGIN SOON TO REDUCE ITS </p><p>NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE GULF.  RECENT STORIES IN THE U.S. </p><p>PRESS HAVE FUELED THIS SPECULATION.  AS APPROPRIATE, </p><p>POSTS SHOULD USE THE TALKING POINTS PROVIDED BELOW TO </p><p>BRIEF THEIR HOST GOVERNMENTS (ESPECIALLY GCC STATES, </p><p>EUROPEAN ALLIES WITH A NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE GULF, AND </p><p>IRAQ) ON U.S. POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  TALKING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>--WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED </p><p>SETTLEMENT TO THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR.  WE ARE PLEASED WITH GCC </p><p>AND ALLIED COOPERATION AND BELIEVE IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN </p><p>THE POSITIVE RESULTS OF OUR MUTUAL EFFORTS--THE </p><p>CEASE-FIRE AND PROGRESS TOWARD FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF 598. </p><p> </p><p>--WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED THAT OUR FORCE </p><p>AUGMENTATION AND THAT OF OUR ALLIES WAS DIRECTLY RELATED </p><p>TO THE THREAT POSED TO OUR SHIPPING, AND TO THE SECURITY </p><p>AND STABILITY OF OUR FRIENDS IN THE REGION.  WE HAVE ALSO </p><p>CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED THAT, SHOULD THE THREAT ABATE, WE </p><p>ARE PREPARED TO REVIEW AND, AS APPROPRIATE, TO REDUCE OUR </p><p>NAVAL DEPLOYMENTS IN THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>--GIVEN THE CLOSE COOPERATIVE AND SUPPORTIVE NATURE OF </p><p>OUR PRESENCE, THAT OF OUR ALLIES, AND OUR FRIENDS IN THE </p><p>GULF, WE WILL ONLY DO SO AFTER CONSULTING CLOSELY WITH </p><p>THE GCC STATES AND AFTER COORDINATING WITH OUR EUROPEAN </p><p>ALLIES.  WE WILL NOT TAKE PREEMPTIVE OR UNILATERAL </p><p>ACTIONS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONSULT WITH YOU AS WE </p><p>ASSESS THE SITUATION IN VIEW OF THE IMMINENT CEASE-FIRE. </p><p> </p><p>--AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE, THE U.S. HAS HAD A NAVAL </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE PERSIAN GULF FOR OVER FORTY YEARS.  THAT </p><p>PRESENCE CLEARLY PRE-DATES THE GULF WAR; WE INTEND TO </p><p>MAINTAIN AN APPROPRIATE NAVAL PRESENCE, EVEN AFTER THE </p><p>PROBLEMS BETWEEN IRAN AND IRAQ ARE RESOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>--THE U.S. INTENDS TO STAY THE COURSE IN THE GULF.  OUR </p><p>POLICY REFLECTS OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AS WE HAVE DEFINED </p><p>THEM OVER MORE THAN EIGHT ADMINISTRATIONS.  IT HAS STRONG </p><p>BIPARTISAN AND PUBLIC SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>(END TALKING POINTS) </p><p> </p><p>4.  FYI ONLY:  THE SIZE AND STRUCTURE OF OUR AUGMENTED </p><p>NAVAL FORCES WILL REMAIN COMMENSURATE WITH THE THREAT. </p><p>AS THAT THREAT DIMINISHES, WE WILL REDUCE THE FORCE AS </p><p>APPROPRIATE.  THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ADVISE WHEN </p><p>FORCE LEVEL CHANGES ARE ANTICIPATED IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE </p><p>EMBASSIES TO CONSULT WITH THE STATES OF THE REGION AND </p><p>OUR ALLIES.  END FYI. YYY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
