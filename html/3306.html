INDEPENDENT, MASS-APPEAL </p><p>ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM REPORTED ON THE FRONT PAGE </p><p>AS WOLFOWITZ\'S STATEMENT THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE A </p><p>KURDISH STATE IN THE NORTH OF IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>SEMI-OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI REPORTED </p><p>AN AMERICAN PLAN TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE QUADRIPARTITE </p><p>MEETING IN WASHINGTON, WHICH AIMS TO LIMIT THE POWERS </p><p>OF ARAFAT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARIES </p><p> </p><p>-- WILL THE QUADRIPARTITE MEETING BECOME A QUINTET? </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST MAHMOUD AL-RIMAWI WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON JULY 15: </p><p>"INTERNATIONAL PARTIES, INCLUDING RUSSIA, ARE WORRIED </p><p>THAT THE QUADRIPARTITE COMMITTEE MAY COLLAPSE BECAUSE </p><p>OF THE ENORMOUS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE </p><p>OTHER MEMBERS. HOWEVER, THESE DIFFERENCES, NO MATTER </p><p>HOW SHARP, ARE BETTER THAT WASHINGTON SUCCEEDING IN </p><p>FORCING ITS WILL ON RUSSIA AND/ OR EUROPE.  THIS </p><p>HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ARAB PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>THE COMMITTEE FOR TWO REASONS:  THE FIRST IS TO AFFIRM </p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL POSITIONS ON THE </p><p>CONFLICT, AND THE SECOND TO RESTORE SOME DIALOGUE </p><p>BETWEEN THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE REST OF THE </p><p>U.S. ADMINISTRATION, WHICH HAS COMMITTED ITSELF TO THE </p><p>LETTER OF THE ISRAELI AGENDA, THUS MAKING THE U.S. A </p><p>PARTNER IN THE OCCUPATION." </p><p> </p><p>-- AMERICAN REFORMS BETWEEN DICTATORSHIPS, TERRORISM, </p><p>AND CORRUPTION </p><p>COLUMNIST ARAFAT HIJAZI WROTE A LENGTHY COMMENTARY IN </p><p>CENTER-LEFT, INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR ON </p><p>JULY 15 IN WHICH HE SAID: "THE U.S. POSES AS THE SELF- </p><p>APPOINTED GUARDIAN OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE WORLD, WHICH </p><p>IS PROMPTED BY HUMANITARIAN REASONS TO LIBERATE THE </p><p>DOWNTRODDEN PEOPLE FROM THEIR CORRUPT AND VILE </p><p>DICTATORS, ALL OF WHOM HAPPEN TO BE ARABS OR MUSLIMS. </p><p>BUSH THE FATHER COULD NOT FIND A SINGLE DICTATOR IN THE </p><p>WORLD EXCEPT IRAQ, SO HE DESTROYED THE IRAQI POWDERED </p><p>MILK FACTORY, THE AMIRIYAH SHELTER WHERE WOMEN AND </p><p>CHILDREN WERE HIDING FROM THE AMERICAN BOMBING, AND </p><p>PLACED IRAQ UNDER A SIEGE THAT KILLED OVER A MILLION </p><p>CIVILIANS. THEN THE U.S. MOVED TO FIGHT TERRORISM, SO </p><p>IT DESTROYED A PHARMACEUTICAL FACTORY IN SUDAN AND </p><p>BOMBED THE HOVELS OF THE POOREST COUNTRY ON EARTH, </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  FINALLY, BUSH THE SON DECLARED HIS WAR ON </p><p>CORRUPTION, AS DEFINED BY THE PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP, </p><p>AND GAVE A MANDATE TO THE WAR CRIMINAL AND MASS </p><p>MURDERER SHARON TO USE AMERICAN WEAPONS TO DESTROY IT. </p><p>THE ISRAELI ARMY DID NOT ASSASSINATE OR ARREST A SINGLE </p><p>CORRUPT PALESTINIAN.  INSTEAD THEY PROCEEDED TO </p><p>MASSACRE WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND DESTROY THEIR HOUSES, </p><p>AS THE AMERICANS DID IN AFGHANISTAN. THESE WARS ARE </p><p>PRETEXTS FOR THE REAL WAR THAT BUSH THE SON DECLARED </p><p>SOON AFTER TAKING POWER, AND WHICH HE LATER DESCRIBED </p><p>AS A SLIP OF THE TONGUE, WHEN HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD </p><p>LEAD A CRUSADE TO BRING PEACE TO THE WORLD, AS IF </p><p>POINTING TO MUSLIMS AS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL IN THE </p><p>WORLD."
