<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003564 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, EAID, ECON, PHUM, IR, IZ, IT, KWAC </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY ON "FUTURE OF IRAQ" EXPERT WORKING GROUPS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03564  181424Z </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 130333 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DCM THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE GOI GENERALLY SUPPORTS OUR "FUTURE OF </p><p>IRAQ" WORKING GROUPS PROPOSAL </p><p>AND IS ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THE AREAS OF PUBLIC HEALTH </p><p>AND CULTURAL PRESERVATION. </p><p>WHILE ITALY VERY MUCH WANTS A DIFFERENT IRAQI GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>POWER, IT IS CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>WHO WILL SUCCEED SADDAM.  IN THE VIEW OF THE ITALIANS, EITHER </p><p>THE ISLAMISTS GAINING POWER </p><p>IN IRAQ OR THE DESTABILIZATION OF THE PERSIAN GULF REGION </p><p>WOULD BE AS BAD AS -- OR WORSE THAN -- </p><p>SADDAM\'S CURRENT REGIME.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) POLOFF DELIVERED REF DEMARCHE TO LUIGI MACCOTTA, THE </p><p>MFA\'S OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR FOR THE PERSIAN GULF AND ROGUE STATES, AND EMANUELE </p><p>FARRUGIA, </p><p>DEPUTY OFFICE DIRECTOR AND DESK OFFICER FOR IRAQ.  ON THE </p><p>PRIORITIES OF THE WORKING </p><p>GROUPS, FARRUGIA SUGGESTED THAT THE FOREIGN AND NATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY POLICY GROUP </p><p>COME FIRST TO ALLOW THE UNCONDITIONAL RETURN OF UN WEAPONS </p><p>INSPECTORS.  ON </p><p>ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE, FARRUGIA EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT THE GOI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03564  181424Z </p><p>FOCUSES -- AND WILL LIKELY FOCUS -- ITS EFFORTS IN IRAQ ON </p><p>TWO DOMAINS: PUBLIC HEALTH AND CULTURAL </p><p>PRESERVATION.  IT IS NOT EASY TO DEAL WITH THE BUREAUCRATIC </p><p>IRAQI GOVERNMENT </p><p>THAT CONSIDERS ANY NGO PART OF AN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, </p><p>COMMENTED FARRUGIA. </p><p>THAT SAID, THE ITALIAN EXPERTS IN IRAQ HAVE DEVELOPED GOOD </p><p>CONTACTS IN ORDER TO </p><p>FACILITATE THEIR TASKS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AMONG EU COUNTRIES, ITALY HAS BEEN ONE OF IRAQ\'S MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT TRADING </p><p>PARTNERS FOR MANY YEARS.  THIS CHANGED AFTER SEPTEMBER 11. </p><p>ITALY\'S EXPORTS TO </p><p>IRAQ FELL FROM 5% TO 1% OF THE OIL FOR FOOD PROGRAM ALLOWANCE </p><p>OVER THE PAST </p><p>YEAR, EXPLAINED FARRUGIA.  THAT WAS THE ECONOMIC PRICE ITALY </p><p>PAID FOR ITS POLITICAL DECISION TO REDUCE OFFICIAL CONTACTS </p><p>WITH IRAQ, WHICH DID NOT TAKE A CLEAR STAND ON TERRORISM, HE </p><p>SAID. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) FARRUGIA STRESSED THAT A MILITARY ATTACK WOULD NOT BE </p><p>ITALY\'S FIRST OPTION FOR </p><p>DEALING WITH SADDAM, DUE IN PART TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE </p><p>STABILITY OF THE REGION. </p><p>ABSENT CAREFUL PLANNING, STRESSED FARRUGIA, THERE IS A REAL </p><p>POSSIBILITY </p><p>FOR THE DESTABILIZATION OF IRAQ AND THE REGION POST-SADDAM. </p><p>THE GOI IS "KEEN </p><p>ON SUPPORTING SECULAR REGIMES, EVEN IF THEY ARE DICTATORIAL </p><p>IN NATURE, OVER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03564  181424Z </p><p>ISLAMIC REGIMES."  THAT IS WHY THE GOI IS SUPPORTING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS IN TUNISIA </p><p>AND ALGERIA.  IF THE SECULAR SADDAM REGIME FALLS, ARGUED </p><p>FARRUGIA, IRAQ </p><p>RUNS THE RISK OF BECOMING A RADICAL SHIITE SOCIETY.  HE ADDED </p><p>THAT THE IRANIAN </p><p>RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES RELY HEAVILY ON THE IRAQIS IN EXILE </p><p>IN IRAN, WHO TEND </p><p>TO BE MOST RADICAL.  AN IRAQ SHIITE STATE REPLACING SADDAM\'S </p><p>REGIME COULD </p><p>PRODUCE ANOTHER IRAN AND BLOCK THE WAY OF REFORM, STRESSED </p><p>FARRUGIA. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE KURDISH ISSUE IS SO IMPORTANT THAT IT OUGHT TO </p><p>HAVE ITS OWN WORKING </p><p>GROUP, ARGUED FARRUGIA.  THE KURDS OUGHT TO ENJOY THEIR </p><p>CULTURAL AUTONOMY. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE KURDS COULD PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE </p><p>STABILIZATION OF A POST-SADDAM </p><p>IRAQ.  THEY ARE USUALLY SUNNIS AND SECULAR, AND THUS COULD </p><p>ENSURE THE </p><p>CONTINUITY OF A SECULAR IRAQ POST-SADDAM, STATED FARRUGIA. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03564 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
