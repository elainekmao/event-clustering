(C) SUMMARY: IN A NOVEMBER 15 MEETING WITH ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY SUSAN E. RICE, FOREIGN MINISTER STAN MUDENGE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SIGNALED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) IS READY </p><p>TO RETURN TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE 1998 DONORS </p><p>CONFERENCE AGREEMENT ON LAND REFORM.  THE MINISTER </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MISTAKES HAD BEEN MADE IN THE FARM </p><p>DESIGNATION AND ACQUISITION PROCESS, AND THAT THERE IS </p><p>AN "ADJUSTMENT EXERCISE" UNDERWAY TO DELIST THE MOST </p><p>PRODUCTIVE COMMERCIAL FARMS.  MUDENGE ALSO SAID THAT THE </p><p>GOZ IS NEGOTIATING WITH THE MANAGERS OF THE SAVE </p><p>CONSERVANCY TO FIND AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION TO THE </p><p>OCCUPATION OF THAT IMPORTANT TOURIST DESTINATION BY WAR </p><p>VETERANS.  MUDENGE SAID THAT THE GOZ VIEWS THE UNDP PLAN </p><p>AS THE WAY FORWARD ON LAND REFORM.  THE GOZ\'S DECISION </p><p>TO ABIDE BY THE SUPREME COURT ORDER DECLARING THE FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS ILLEGAL (REF A) IS INTENDED AS A SIGNAL THAT </p><p>THE GOZ IS SERIOUS ABOUT RESOLVING THE LAND ISSUE </p><p>AMICABLY.  IF THE DONORS ARE WILLING TO COME BACK AND </p><p>FUND LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE, THE GOZ WILL EFFECTIVELY </p><p>AND IMMEDIATELY, IF NOT EXPLICITLY, BACK AWAY FROM ITS </p><p>FAST-TRACK RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM ACCORDING TO MUDENGE. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, MUDENGE BELIEVES PRESIDENT MUGABE MAY WELL </p><p>BE PREPARED TO LEAVE OFFICE ONCE THE LAND ISSUE IS </p><p>WORKED OUT, AND AFTER A REASONABLE FACE-SAVING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06644  01 OF 03  281616Z </p><p>INTERLUDE.  HE CAUTIONED HOWEVER, THAT MUGABE WILL PUSH </p><p>THE COUNTRY OVER THE PRECIPICE IF MASS ACTION BY THE </p><p>OPPOSITION BACKS HIM INTO A CORNER.  THE SECURITY FORCES </p><p>HAVE BEEN GIVEN ORDERS TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE, SHORT </p><p>OF USING LETHAL FORCE, TO STOP MASS ACTION, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON NOVEMBER 15, ASSISTANT SECRETARY SUSAN E. </p><p>RICE, ACCOMPANIED BY OFFICE OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN AFFAIRS </p><p>DIRECTOR ARLENE RENDER, SPECIAL ASSISTANT DON GATTO, </p><p>AMBASSADOR TOM MCDONALD, DCM, AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER), </p><p>MET MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS STAN MUDENGE. </p><p>ACCOMPANYING THE FOREIGN MINISTER WERE POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC AFFAIRS DIRECTOR DR. NGONI CHIDEYA, AFRICA AND </p><p>MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR GODFREY MWEDZI, UNDERSECRETARY FOR </p><p>EUROPE AND AMERICAS JONATHAN WUTAUNASHE, AND U.S. DESK </p><p>OFFICER RICHARD CHIBUWE.  THE MEETING OPENED WITH A </p><p>DISCUSSION ON DRC MATTERS, WHICH WILL BE REPORTED </p><p>SEPTEL. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>GOVERNMENT WILL PLAY BY ITS OWN RULES </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE FOREIGN MINISTER THEN OFFERED TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>LAND ISSUE.  HE OPENED BY SAYING THAT ERRORS HAD BEEN </p><p>MADE IN THE GOZ\'S DESIGNATION AND ACQUISITION OF FARM </p><p>PROPERTIES FOR RESETTLEMENT.  IN FACT, AN "ADJUSTMENT </p><p>EXERCISE" IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY TO REMOVE A NUMBER OF </p><p>AGRI-BUSINESS FARMS FROM THE ACQUISITION LIST. </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 200 OF THE COUNTRY\'S MOST PRODUCTIVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06644  01 OF 03  281616Z </p><p>TOBACCO FARMS, WHICH PRODUCE A GOOD DEAL OF ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>FOREIGN EXCHANGE, WOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE LIST, </p><p>MUDENGE STATED.  THE GOZ WOULD AUTOMATICALLY DELIST </p><p>OTHER FARMS THAT DO NOT MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PURPOSES.  THE GOZ WOULD ALSO NOT LIST NEW </p><p>PROPERTIES FOR ACQUISITION TO REMOVE THE "CLOUD OF </p><p>DOUBT" HANGING OVER THE REMAINING FARMS SO THAT THEY CAN </p><p>PLANT AND HARVEST THEIR CROPS WITH CONFIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) NONETHELESS, THE GOZ EXPECTED SOME OWNERS OF </p><p>LISTED FARMS TO RESIST COMPULSORY ACQUISITION, THE </p><p>MINISTER CONTINUED.  THE GOZ WOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE </p><p>REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE 90 DAYS </p><p>NOTICE OF ACQUISITION AND THAT ALLOW UP TO A 60-DAY </p><p>APPEAL PROCESS IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE COURT.  FARMERS </p><p>COULD SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGE THE ACQUISITION OF THEIR </p><p>FARM IF THEY COULD SHOW THAT THE FARM WOULD NOT BE USED </p><p>FOR RESETTLEMENT PURPOSES.  MUDENGE CLAIMED THAT SOME </p><p>FARMERS HAD ALREADY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THEIR </p><p>PROPERTIES DELISTED BY WAY OF THE APPEAL PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE CONCERNS THAT AMERICAN </p><p>INVESTORS IN THE AREA OF THE SAVE CONSERVANCY HAVE OVER </p><p>THE OCCUPATION OF THE GAME PARK BY WAR VETERANS.

MUDENGE </p><p>STATED THAT THE CONSERVANCY IS NEAR THE DISTRICT HE </p><p>REPRESENTS IN PARLIAMENT (MASVINGO NORTH), AND THAT HE </p><p>HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE PARK MANAGERS AND OTHER </p><p>INTERESTED PARTIES IN THE AREA.  HE STATED THAT THE </p><p>MEDIA HAD EXAGGERATED THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE </p><p>SQUATTERS, BUT THAT HE WAS TRYING TO WORK OUT A DEAL TO </p><p>SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  THE WHITE MANAGERS HAD PROPOSED AN </p><p>ARRANGEMENT WHERE SOME OF THE PROCEEDS GENERATED FROM </p><p>THE PARK WOULD GO TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.  THE MINISTER </p><p>COUNTERED THAT THAT WOULD STILL LEAVE THE CONSERVANCY A </p><p>"WHITE ISLAND," A STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT WAS NOT </p><p>ACCEPTABLE.  NONETHELESS, HE FELT THE TWO SIDES WERE </p><p>CLOSER TO REACHING AN AMICABLE AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>UNDP INITIATIVE IS THE WAY FORWARD </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE GROUP THEN BROKE UP SO THAT ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY RICE AND THE MINISTER COULD HAVE A PRIVATE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MEETING.  IN THAT ONE-ON-ONE, MUDENGE TOLD THE SECRETARY </p><p>THAT THE GOZ SEES THE UNDP LAND REFORM INITIATIVE AS THE </p><p>WAY FORWARD.  HE SAID THAT THE UNDP PLAN (REF C) IS IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES AGREED UPON AT THE 1998 </p><p>DONORS CONFERENCE ON LAND.  IT IS ALSO IN ACCORDANCE </p><p>WITH THE RULE OF LAW, TRANSPARENCY, AND ECONOMIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06644  02 OF 03  281602Z </p><p>VIABILITY.  IF THE DONORS AGREED TO COME BACK TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO FUND LAND REFORM, THE GOZ WOULD EFFECTIVELY, </p><p>ALTHOUGH NOT EXPLICITLY, DROP ITS FAST-TRACK LAND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM "LIKE A HOT POTATO."  THE GOZ ONLY </p><p>ADOPTED IT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN BACKED INTO A CORNER AND </p><p>SAW NO OTHER WAY OUT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>RULE OF LAW WILL RETURN </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) THE MINISTER CHARACTERIZED THE GOZ\'S DECISION TO </p><p>ABIDE BY THE SUPREME COURT\'S CONSENT ORDER DECLARING THE </p><p>FARM OCCUPATIONS ILLEGAL (REF A) AS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND </p><p>WOULD LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE UNDP LAND REFORM </p><p>INITIATIVE.  HE SAID THE DECISION WAS HOTLY DEBATED IN </p><p>CABINET, BUT ULTIMATELY IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE GOZ </p><p>COULD NOT AFFORD TO DISOBEY ITS OWN LAWS OR BE PERCEIVED </p><p>AS DOING SO.  (COMMENT:  OF COURSE, THIS WOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>BEEN THE FIRST TIME.  END COMMENT.)  HE STATED THAT BY </p><p>AGREEING TO THE RULING, THE GOZ AGREED TO ABIDE BY THE </p><p>RULES AND REGULATIONS ALREADY SPELLED OUT IN THE LAND </p><p>LEGISLATION.. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>MUGABE WILL GO, BUT DON\'T PUSH </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WHEN ASKED IF MUGABE WILL RETIRE, MUDENGE </p><p>REPLIED THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY WELL BE PREPARED TO GO IF </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE IS WORKED OUT FIRST.  HE SAID THAT MANY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06644  02 OF 03  281602Z </p><p>IN ZANU-PF WON\'T LET HIM GO UNTIL THE LAND ISSUE IS </p><p>RESOLVED ONCE AND FOR ALL.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE OTHERS IN </p><p>THE RULING PARTY WHO ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE PARTY\'S </p><p>SURVIVAL.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER STATED THAT MUGABE\'S </p><p>CURRENT THINKING IS THAT HE WILL RUN AGAIN FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY IN 2002, AND THEN ONCE RE-ELECTED, STEP DOWN </p><p>AFTER A YEAR OR TWO. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) MUDENGE CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, THAT IF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION ENGAGES IN MASS ACTION, IT WILL PUSH MUGABE </p><p>INTO A CORNER.  IF MUGABE IS PUSHED TOO HARD, HE WILL </p><p>TAKE THE COUNTRY OVER THE CLIFF, MUDENGE WARNED.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT A STATE OF EMERGENCY, SUSPENSION OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT, OR MARTIAL LAW ARE ALL POSSIBILITIES IF MASS </p><p>ACTION COMES TO PASS.  THE MINISTER STATED THAT HE </p><p>BELIEVES THE BRITISH ARE ENCOURAGING MASS ACTION IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE AND THAT THE EU HAS LOST ALL INFLUENCE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE BECAUSE IT HAS ALIGNED ITSELF WITH THE BRITISH. </p><p>THE GOZ IS TRYING NOT TO PROVOKE THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE </p><p>THE MDC IS TRYING TO BAIT THE GOVERNMENT INTO USING </p><p>VIOLENCE.  THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE BEEN GIVEN ORDERS TO </p><p>USE ALL MEANS NECESSARY, BUT EXPLICITLY NOT/NOT LETHAL </p><p>FORCE, TO STOP THE PLANNED MASS ACTION (REF B).  THE </p><p>MINISTER HINTED THAT THESE ORDERS COULD BE IGNORED--OR </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6670 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  06644  03 OF 03  281603Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  COME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------A4AB5A  281603Z /68 </p><p>O 281353Z NOV 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7715 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 006644 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USTR FOR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/28/10 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, ECON, EAGR, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER SIGNALS POSSIBLE SHIFT IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  06644  03 OF 03  281603Z </p><p>ZIMBABWE LAND REFORM POLICY </p><p> </p><p>CHANGED--IF THE THREAT TO THE GOVERNMENT BECAME DIRE, </p><p>HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>SOME SIGNS OF RATIONALITY </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT: MUDENGE\'S COMMENTS COULD SIGNAL A </p><p>MAJOR SHIFT IN THE GOZ\'S LAND REFORM POLICY, AND </p><p>POSSIBLY A BROADER WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN TURNING AROUND ITS FREE- </p><p>FALLING ECONOMY.  MUDENGE\'S STATEMENTS MEAN MORE SINCE </p><p>HE IS A ZANU-PF HARDLINER AND HAS BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF </p><p>THE DONORS\' STANCE ON LAND REFORM.  RULING PARTY LEADERS </p><p>MAY HAVE FINALLY COME TO RECOGNIZE THE UNSUSTAINABILITY </p><p>OF ITS LAND REFORM "PROGRAM" AND THE DISASTROUS EFFECTS </p><p>IT HAS HAD ON THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMY AND ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>POPULARITY.  THE CHANGE IN DIRECTION APPEARS TO GO </p><p>DEEPER THAN PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS WHEN MINISTERS GAVE ORDERS </p><p>TO REMOVE FARM OCCUPIERS WHEN MUGABE WAS OUT OF COUNTRY, </p><p>ONLY TO BE REVERSED WHEN MUGABE RETURNED.  MUGABE WAS IN </p><p>COUNTRY WHEN MUDENGE TALKED WITH THE ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY, AND THE DECISION TO ABIDE BY THE SUPREME </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>COURT RULING MUST HAVE BEEN MADE WELL BEFORE MUGABE LEFT </p><p>FOR LIBYA NOVEMBER 11. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: THE REAL TEST OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S RESOLVE, HOWEVER, REMAINS IN ITS </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO REIGN IN WAR VETERANS AND OTHERS WHO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06644  03 OF 03  281603Z </p><p>CONTINUE TO ATTACK FARMERS AND ITS WILLINGNESS TO EXPEL </p><p>THOUSANDS OF SQUATTERS FROM OCCUPIED FARMS, MANY OF WHOM </p><p>HAVE BUILT PERMANENT HOUSES.  RECENT ATTACKS ON WAR </p><p>VETERANS IN THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA COULD </p><p>PRESAGE THE END OF THEIR HEYDAY ON THE COMMERCIAL FARMS. </p><p>THE EMBASSY THINKS MUGABE MAY FINALLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF COMMERCIAL FARMING, ALONG WITH LAW AND </p><p>ORDER AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN </p><p>HIS, AND HIS PARTY\'S, UNDOING. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: FINALLY, CONTRARY TO THE </p><p>MINISTER\'S ASSERTIONS, RELIABLE EMBASSY SOURCES TELL US </p><p>THAT THE SAVE CONSERVANCY PROBLEM IS NOT CLOSE TO BEING </p><p>SOLVED AND THAT THE MINISTER IS POLITICALLY ALLIED WITH </p><p>THOSE OFFICIALS WHO ARE PREVENTING RESOLUTION.
