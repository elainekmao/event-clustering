Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b/d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: While problems remain in the U.S. bilateral </p><p>military relationship with Nigeria, significant signs of </p><p>improvement are evident.  The relationship between the </p><p>Embassy and Ministry of Defense has improved as a result of </p><p>the February 2001 creation of Minister of State positions for </p><p>each Service.  Closer coordination between the Ministry and </p><p>the Services appears to be the result, leading to fewer </p><p>instances of bureaucratic inertia hindering bilateral </p><p>efforts.  The new Service Chiefs are more open and available </p><p>than the old, and at least on the face of it, appear to </p><p>closely follow the directions and intent of the civilian </p><p>government.  The MPRI team has had greater success in recent </p><p>months in working with their counterparts and senior </p><p>officials.  The different levels of cooperation seen between </p><p>Phase 1 and Phase 3 of Operation Focus Relief epitomize these </p><p>changes.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>===================================== </p><p>SLOW CHANGE, BUT CHANGE JUST THE SAME </p><p>===================================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) We have seen real progress in our military </p><p>relationship with Nigeria in a number of areas.  This is in </p><p>part due to the level of engagement over the last year, </p><p>through OFR, MPRI and our general security assistance (SA) </p><p>programs.  It is also due to the key input of some new </p><p>cooperative players (the Army Minister and new Service </p><p>Chiefs), and the removal of some others (particularly the </p><p>testy former Chief of Army Staff). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Even so, problems remain in the bilateral military </p><p>relationship with Nigeria, and will not go away quickly. </p><p>Civilian authority over the military is still being </p><p>established, bureaucratic inertia and slipshod coordination </p><p>between the MOD and Services remains problematic, and the </p><p>desire among many to shrug off assistance in favor of </p><p>contracts where kickbacks are available continue to hamper </p><p>assistance efforts.  Emerging from a history of military </p><p>governments where the Chief of Army Staff was essentially </p><p>number three in the national decision-making </p><p>chain-of-command, and often appointed Ministers (including </p><p>the Minister of Defense), Nigeria is working to establish </p><p>civilian control of the military.  This is a sensitive area, </p><p>and the GON is proceeding cautiously.  The Services resist </p><p>accountability to the Ministry, and some Ministry officials </p><p>remain focused on money-making from contracts rather than </p><p>genuine reform.  Furthermore, real engagement between the MOD </p><p>(read Federal Government) and the National Assembly remains </p><p>tenuous.  This hinders national defense planning and force </p><p>development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================================ </p><p>DEFENSE COOPERATION - BABY STEPS </p><p>================================ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) A biweekly defense cooperation meeting between the </p><p>Office of Defense Cooperation, Ministry of Defense and </p><p>Services, was created by the DATT to improve defense </p><p>cooperation communication (Reftel).  The biweeklies, used to </p><p>discuss FMS/FMF cases, IMET and other assistance programs, </p><p>have brought about progress in SA and have improved Nigerian </p><p>understanding of SA programs.  Additionally, a week-long </p><p>DISAM security assistance workshop has begun for Ministry of </p><p>Defense and Service members.  Initial attendance at the </p><p>workshop is around 30 people, a number that reflects genuine </p><p>interest within the Ministry and Services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) At a November biweekly meeting, while reviewing </p><p>upcoming IMET courses with members of the MOD and Services, </p><p>it was revealed that one Army course had been cancelled, and </p><p>that three other Army slots were at risk, for lack of </p><p>nominees.  Expressing profound dissatisfaction, the Army </p><p>representative demanded to know why MOD was sending Army </p><p>nomination letters to the office of the Chief of Defense </p><p>Staff, rather than to the Army. (COMMENT: Normally, proper </p><p>procedure dictates that a written letter is delivered to the </p><p>Army Staff from the Joint Services Department (JSD) through </p><p>the Chief of Defense Staff (CDS), and the reply to ODC must </p><p>go through the CDS and DIA.  If this procedure is not </p><p>followed, the Army will not take action for fear of the CDS\'s </p><p>wrath.  Previously, these meetings could not occur, as the </p><p>Acting ODC Chief, like the DATT, was not allowed direct </p><p>contact with the Ministry or Services without DIA approval, </p><p>which often took weeks to receive.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) General dissatisfaction was expressed at the lack of </p><p>timely action by the Office of the CDS.  After some hand </p><p>wringing over "proper procedure," the group decided that all </p><p>course offerings would be sent directly to the Service for </p><p>action, with an info copy to the CDS.  In subsequent </p><p>meetings, this decision was reversed, but the spirit of </p><p>speeding the process by bypassing delays remained. </p><p>Additionally, the DATT has suggested to the Services that a </p><p>biweekly meeting be held at their level to discuss </p><p>Service-specific issues.  Thus far, only the Air Force has </p><p>responded favorably. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============================== </p><p>OPERATION FOCUS RELIEF - </p><p>A BILATERAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE </p><p>=============================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The positive change in the relationship is perhaps </p><p>most visibly exemplified by Operation Focus Relief (OFR). </p><p>Planning and executing Phase 1 of the program, which trained </p><p>and equipped two Nigerian battalions, were extremely labor </p><p>intensive and difficult.  While the units themselves, </p><p>grudgingly at first, accepted the training and benefited </p><p>tremendously, the civilian GON had a difficult time driving </p><p>the program forward.  Although approved by the President </p><p>himself, and supported (with varying degrees of enthusiasm) </p><p>by Minister of Defense Danjuma, National Security Advisor </p><p>Aliyu Mohammed and Chief of Defense Staff Admiral Ibrahim </p><p>Ogohi, the Army hierarchy, controlled by (then) Chief of Army </p><p>Staff, Lieutenant General S. Victor Malu, did everything </p><p>possible to block successful execution.  Pressure was placed </p><p>on brigade and battalion commanders by the Army Chief to </p><p>cause delays in the program.  In fact, the relationship </p><p>during Phase 1 was so difficult that Nigeria was not included </p><p>in Phase 2.  A high-level meeting between senior USG and GON </p><p>Officials in April 2001 was required to settle numerous </p><p>issues raised by the Chief of Army Staff in his effort to </p><p>derail engagement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) However, after each Service got its own Minister of </p><p>State (Deputy Minister) in February and the retirement of the </p><p>three Service Chiefs in June 2001, cooperation between the </p><p>Embassy and GON on defense-related programs improved </p><p>tremendously.  Chief of Defense Staff Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi </p><p>acted like a weathervane.  Ogohi, who had been reasonably </p><p>supportive of engagement when not in Malu\'s presence but </p><p>whose support went south when Malu was around, became a </p><p>strong supporter with the appointment of the new Deputy </p><p>Ministers and Service Chiefs.  Execution of Phase 3 became a </p><p>cooperative venture between the GON, Nigerian military and </p><p>USG.  The new Chief of Army Staff, LTG Alexander Ogomudia, </p><p>warmly welcomed the 3SFG 3 Battalion Commander during his </p><p>initial visit, approved the Program of Instruction (POI), </p><p>addressed concerns of his staff, and even suggested a joint </p><p>U.S.-Nigerian Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) </p><p>visit to the Phase 1 troops in Sierra Leone.  After stating </p><p>he had not approved participation of one of the three </p><p>battalions selected for Phase 3, he immediately reversed </p><p>course and approved their inclusion when he learned that camp </p><p>construction had already begun.  Public Affairs coordination </p><p>between the Embassy and the Defense Headquarters bloomed soon </p><p>after Minister Danjuma\'s assent to a public affairs workshop </p><p>that exposed the senior Public Relations Officers of the </p><p>Nigerian Services to conventional military public affairs </p><p>doctrine. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Throughout OFR Phase 3, the GON and Nigerian Army were </p><p>supportive and flexible.  In response to September 11, the </p><p>Army increased force protection to the U.S. trainers.  The </p><p>Air Force provided space for a logistics and administrative </p><p>Forward Operating Base (FOB) and was responsive and </p><p>supportive of medical evacuation contingencies.  The Army </p><p>opened its doors to the DATT in ways not seen in Nigeria for </p><p>at least a decade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>========================== </p><p>COMMENT: A WHOLE NEW WORLD </p><p>========================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) COMMENT: While these changes perhaps appear small </p><p>from an outside perspective, they are significant for defense </p><p>cooperation in Nigeria.  For almost two years, all </p><p>correspondence had to go through Nigerian DIA.  This blockage </p><p>was removed by Army Minister Batagarawa (reftel).  When the </p><p>office of the CDS was not acting in a timely fashion on IMET </p><p>courses, mid-ranking officers and MOD staff sought to </p><p>circumvent the blockage.  For mid-ranking officers to bargain </p><p>for slots and usurp the province of the CDS is unheard of in </p><p>this "big man" culture.  The biggest stakeholders in this </p><p>process, the Services, now appear to be taking a stand, to </p><p>the benefit of the IMET program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) COMMENT CONT: Many problems, such as the MOD\'s </p><p>inability to complete the OFR MOI (until very near the end of </p><p>OFR Phase 3) or pay the remaining FY01 MPRI amount in a </p><p>timely manner, remain and are visible reminders of the need </p><p>for further significant reform.  However, there is a </p><p>beneficial aspect to security assistance and programs like </p><p>OFR that should not be overlooked.  Years of military rule, </p><p>ironically, caused the Ministry and Services to atrophy.  By </p><p>pushing U.S. defense cooperation programs through the </p><p>Nigerian bureaucratic process, the pipes are being cleared of </p><p>blockages.  Moreover, the MOD and the Services are starting </p><p>to see and respond to the benefits of U.S. assistance.  Graft </p><p>is difficult with U.S. programs.  This was a disincentive to </p><p>those who might have supported engagement with the U.S. </p><p>However, the qualitative improvement in capabilities (as seen </p><p>with OFR) appears to have convinced many in the MOD and </p><p>Services to reassess the costs and benefits of engagement. </p><p>They appear to have come to the conclusion that, even with </p><p>the loss of graft, engagement with the United States is </p><p>worthwhile. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) DAO COMMENT: Despite the new era of cooperation, the </p><p>security assistance program, the largest in sub-Saharan </p><p>Africa, is behind schedule.  This is due to the earlier </p><p>problems and lack of access and information exchange. </p><p>Basically, the FMF program is one year behind schedule. </p><p>However, since the majority of these assistance cases have </p><p>been designed by the DATT to be "roll-over" year-to-year </p><p>cases, the LOAs can be extended rather than regenerated. </p><p>Such cases include: C-130 technical assistance, spare parts, </p><p>safety and other publications and training; U.S. Coast Guard </p><p>Balsam-Class Buoy Tenders exchange; MPRI; and the combat </p><p>simulation center.  Given the improving relationship, it </p><p>would be unfortunate and counter-productive if the Nigeria </p><p>FMF budget were redirected.  END DAO COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
