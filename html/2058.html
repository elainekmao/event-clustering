<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002591 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/12/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: TFUS01: CALL TO PRESIDENT OBASANJO REGARDING AIR </p><p>STRIKES </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C)  I spoke by phone with President Obasanjo soon after </p><p>his October 7 telephone call from the White House during </p><p>which Vice President Cheney informed Obasanjo of our imminent </p><p>air strikes against terrorist targets in Afghanistan. </p><p>Obasanjo stated that he saw the value in VP Cheney\'s request </p><p>to call key West African Heads of State to shore up their </p><p>support for our action.  To this end, the President said he </p><p>would immediately call his Senegalese, Malian and Ghanaian </p><p>colleagues that evening. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C)  Looking a bit closer to home, Obasanjo speculated that </p><p>Zamfara, Kano, Sokoto and possibly Kaduna could experience </p><p>public demonstrations as a result of our actions.  As a </p><p>precaution, he had ordered security to be beefed up and </p><p>placed on heightened alert in those areas.  I suggested that </p><p>he include often tumultuous Lagos in the increased security </p><p>coverage and emphasized the need for Nigerian security forces </p><p>to pay special attention to the protection of American lives </p><p>and property at this critical moment.  Obasanjo said that he </p><p>understood our concern.  He suggested that we share as much </p><p>information as possible with his security agencies, promising </p><p>that those agencies would reciprocate.  Obasanjo requested </p><p>that I stay in close touch with his National Security </p><p>Advisor, Aliyu Mohammed, which I assured him I would do. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
