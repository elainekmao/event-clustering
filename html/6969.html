<p>UNCLAS SANAA 000628 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NEA/ARP FOR MIKE MILLER AND PAT HEFFERNAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EFIN, YM, DEMARCHE </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMENI DEMARCHE ON MONEY CONVERSION PROBLEMS IN </p><p>INDIA </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is an action request.  See para 5. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) According to the Yemeni Foreign Ministry, the State </p><p>Bank of India has, at USG request, adopted restrictions </p><p>affecting the ability of the Yemeni Embassy in New Delhi to </p><p>transfer funds abroad.  Abdul Salaam Al-Awadhi, Director of </p><p>the Two Americas Department at the MFA in Sanaa, convoked the </p><p>DCM March 31 to raise this problem and request our assistance </p><p>in clarifying and resolving it. Al-Awadhi, acting upon </p><p>instructions of FM Al-Qirbi in making this demarche, added </p><p>that the Yemeni Embassy in New Delhi had informed Sanaa of </p><p>this problem about a week ago. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Al-Awadhi said the Yemeni Embassy had made </p><p>inquiries at the Indian Foreign Ministry and was told that </p><p>the Indian MFA had not conveyed any instructions or </p><p>information to the State Bank of India vis-a-vis the Yemeni </p><p>Embassy.  Asked if the Yemeni Embassy had contacted the U.S. </p><p>Embassy in New Delhi, Al-Awadhi replied that his report from </p><p>New Delhi made no mention of this.  He added that the </p><p>restriction by the State Bank of India is causing problems </p><p>for personnel at the Yemeni Embassy and for Yemeni students </p><p>in India.  DCM said that Embassy Sanaa had received no </p><p>information from Washington or New Delhi about this issue, </p><p>and would report the problem and request a response. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Al-Awadhi provided a "non-paper" that he said </p><p>summarized the report Sanaa had received from its Embassy in </p><p>New Delhi.  Following is our unofficial translation: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text:  The Embassy of the Yemeni Republic in New Delhi </p><p>has reported that the State Bank of India, with which the </p><p>Embassy has dealings, has informed it that it is not </p><p>permitted for (the Embassy) to transfer any amounts outside </p><p>of India -- except through the Embassy\'s official account or </p><p>through the personal accounts of the two (Embassy) </p><p>representatives, without a statement of the purpose of the </p><p>transfer, for example, the name of the person or agency, and </p><p>the nature of the connection or relationship, and the reason </p><p>for the transfer.  The Embassy contacted the director of the </p><p>above-mentioned bank and was informed that this measure was </p><p>undertaken based upon a request from the government of the </p><p>United States of America.  End Text. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Action Request: We would appreciate Department </p><p>assistance in obtaining information, from Treasury and/or </p><p>Embassy New Delhi, with which we can respond to the Yemeni </p><p>request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
