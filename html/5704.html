Not for Internet Distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is an action message.  See para   . </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  Turkish officials announced that the </p><p>temporary suspension of new phytosanitary regulations </p><p>implemented on January 3, 2003 that have impacted </p><p>agricultural trade with Turkey.  Post expects official </p><p>announcement shortly.  Pressure from Turkish poultry and </p><p>feed representatives, trading companies and foreign </p><p>governments played a major role in this decision.  At </p><p>subsequent meetings between USDA and Turkish officials </p><p>agreement was reached on a number of technical issues which, </p><p>if implemented, will ensure continued access to the Turkish </p><p>market for U.S. commodities and plant products.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Suspension of Phyto Regulations </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (SBU)  On February 6, Vedat Uzunlu, Turkey\'s Deputy </p><p>Under Secretary for Agriculture and Rural Affairs told USDA </p><p>officials that Turkey\'s new phytosanitary regulations </p><p>implemented on January 3 (Ref A) would be suspended until </p><p>July.   The announcement was made during a meeting with USDA </p><p>officials including representatives from Animal and Plant </p><p>Health and Inspection Service (APHIS) and Federal Grain </p><p>Inspection Service (FGIS).  APHIS and FGIS officials were in </p><p>Ankara to discuss U.S. concerns about the new regulations </p><p>with Turkish officials.  Dr. Uzunlu noted that the Turkish </p><p>government would be reviewing the regulations over the next </p><p>several months with industry and foreign governments in the </p><p>hope that new regulations could be announced in July that </p><p>would not impact trade.  Uzunlu welcomed any help USDA could </p><p>provide in furthering these discussions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  It appears that pressure from industry groups as </p><p>well as foreign governments persuaded Ministry of </p><p>Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) officials to take </p><p>action to rescind these regulations.  Since they were </p><p>implemented in early January, the regulations had severely </p><p>impacted agricultural trade and in turn Turkey\'s domestic </p><p>agriculture industries.  At a meeting with the Turkish </p><p>poultry producers association, MARA officials were informed </p><p>that the poultry industry would soon run out of feed unless </p><p>the regulations were lifted.  U.S. exports of corn were </p><p>completely halted as a result of the regulations which left </p><p>Turkey\'s feed and poultry industries without any raw </p><p>materials.  According to traders, corn prices had increased </p><p>by close to $40 a ton during the month the regulations were </p><p>in place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>Confirmation from Other Sources </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Post was contacted by industry officials as well </p><p>as representatives from the Hungarian and EU delegations in </p><p>Turkey who had received the same information about the </p><p>suspension.  According to DUS/Uzunlu the suspension would be </p><p>announced shortly in the Official Gazete which is the </p><p>equivalent to the U.S. Federal Register.  Post is monitoring </p><p>this publication for this announcement and will inform </p><p>Washington immediately. Unfortunately, due to the Muslim </p><p>holiday, publication may be delayed until the week of </p><p>February 17th. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>USDA Technical Discussions </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>5.  (SBU)  On February 6, the USDA delegation met with </p><p>Protection and Control officials to discuss their concerns </p><p>with the new regulations.  USDA officials stressed the </p><p>importance of greater more communication between U.S. and </p><p>Turkish technical staffs as a way of exchanging information </p><p>and avoiding any misunderstandings in the future. </p><p>6.  (SBU) Technical concerns in grains, seeds, wood </p><p>products, oilseeds and vegetables were discussed.  In each </p><p>case, the Turkish officials agreed in principal to change </p><p>the regulations after a further review.  However, until </p><p>these changes are officially announced, it is not certain </p><p>that they will actually be accepted and implemented.  Post </p><p>will work with APHIS officials on a follow-up letter to </p><p>confirm these changes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUEST: TIRF Proposal </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) During the technical discussions in Ankara, it </p><p>became clear that current Turkish quarantine and research </p><p>officials had little understanding of the U.S. grain </p><p>inspection system and the U.S. approach to phytosanitary </p><p>issues.  APHIS/FGIS/FAS delegation suggests that a </p><p>delegation of Turkish technical officials would greatly </p><p>benefit from visits to grain inspection and testing </p><p>facilities. FAS/ITP along with APHIS officials will prepare </p><p>a proposal under the Technical Issues Resolution Fund (TIRF) </p><p>with the hope of sending a Turkish team to the United States </p><p>in April.  Post supports this proposal as a first step in </p><p>improving communications between U.S. and Turkish Officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Comment:  Timing is Everything </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The combination of immediate pressure from </p><p>Turkey\'s domestic industries along with foreign governments </p><p>played a major role in the suspension of the phytosanitary </p><p>regulations.  In addition, the lack of feed in Turkey and </p><p>the absence of alternative corn imports also helped Turkish </p><p>officials to respond positively on these issues.  The timely </p><p>visit of the APHIS/FGIX team to Ankara added additional </p><p>weight and legitimacy to these concerns.  By responding to </p><p>the situation quickly the team was able to maximize these </p><p>factors. The new Turkish Ministry of Agriculture officials </p><p>appears to be more open to discussions, at least initially. </p><p>(Septel) It is essential that the meetings between USDA and </p><p>Turkish agriculture officials this past week only be the </p><p>first step in order to ensure continued cooperation and </p><p>access to this market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MARCIEL </p><p></p></div>
