<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001934 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, ECON, PHUM, PGOV, ZI, Land Reform </p><p>SUBJECT: DISPLACED FARM WORKERS: UNADDRESSED HUMANITARIAN </p><p>CHALLENGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary:  The arrests and evictions of commercial </p><p>farmers continue, with most farmers being released on bail </p><p>with varying conditions.  Some farmers are having their </p><p>Section 8 acquisition  orders overturned on technicalities, </p><p>but this seems to be a temporary reprieve at best.  The fate </p><p>of the farm workers on these farms remains in limbo, although </p><p>"war vet" pressure for retrenchment packages -- with the war </p><p>vets reportedly retaining 30-40% of the remuneration for </p><p>their efforts -- continues to complicate the situation. </p><p>Credible reports of well-connected and wealthy black </p><p>Zimbabweans taking possession of desirable farms from white </p><p>Zimbabweans continue to be published in the independent media </p><p>and through Justice for Agriculture (JAG), an agricultural </p><p>advocacy coalition.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Although the momentum has slowed down due to various </p><p>factors -- including, in some cases, the absence of relevant </p><p>landowners -- arrests of commercial farmers are continuing, </p><p>and the GOZ-controlled press continues to trumpet that "there </p><p>is no going back on land reform."  The process continues to </p><p>follow the pattern of arrest and a brief stay in jail, </p><p>followed by a bail hearing and continuation of the </p><p>proceedings until a later date. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Several farmers have used variations on the strategy </p><p>of opposing the preliminary Section 5 and final Section 8 </p><p>notices of acquisition based on the GOZ\'s failure to notify </p><p>other interested parties, as required by the GOZ\'s own law </p><p>and regulations.  Judges and magistrates in the lower courts </p><p>have had some sympathy for these arguments.  In some cases, </p><p>the farmers are arguing that the acquisition orders should be </p><p>overturned since the bondholder or mortgage holder was not </p><p>notified of the GOZ\'s intention to acquire the subject </p><p>property.  In at least one case, a sugar cane grower </p><p>successfully argued that his acquisition notices were invalid </p><p>due to the existence of a water servitude and the failure of </p><p>the GOZ to notify Hippo Valley, one of the main sugar growing </p><p>plantations, which is also the local administrator of the </p><p>sugar cane irrigation scheme.  Other farmers have </p><p>successfully gained reprieve by arguing that the GOZ could </p><p>not prove service of preliminary Section 5 or final Section 8 </p><p>notices of acquisition on the farmers. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Notorious war veteran Joseph Chinotimba, who led </p><p>some of the extortionate factory invasions as well as farm </p><p>invasions during the past two years, has reportedly been </p><p>hired by a wealthy Zanu-PF land recipient to forcibly evict a </p><p>commercial farmer who successfully had his Section 8 order </p><p>nullified by the High Court.  Chinotimba, in his role as </p><p>vice-president of the GOZ-controlled organization Zimbabwe </p><p>Federation of Trade Unions (ZFTU), has been implicated in </p><p>extorting money from commercial farmers by coercing farm </p><p>workers into demanding exorbitant "exit packages" from </p><p>dispossessed commercial farmers -- for a healthy fee. </p><p>Farmers Vince and Monica Schultz, who are still engaged in </p><p>forex-earning horticultural operations, report that </p><p>Chinotimba descended upon their farm on August 22 with a </p><p>group of Zanu-PF youth militia members to demand that they </p><p>pay astronomical retrenchment packages to their 135 farm </p><p>workers, and that they vacate the farm despite the court </p><p>order allowing them to remain.  As in other reported cases, </p><p>Chinotimba is likely to  retain 30% to 40% of each </p><p>retrenchment package for his efforts.  Interestingly, the </p><p>farmers report that the beneficiary of this particular farm </p><p>seizure, Bright Matonga, the CEO of parastatal bus company </p><p>the Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (ZUPCO), has visited </p><p>the farm several times and informed the workers that since he </p><p>is now the owner, they would now be working for him -- </p><p>obviating the argument that the workers have lost their </p><p>employment and are thus due exit packages even if the </p><p>Schultzes are forcibly dispossessed.  The Schultzes have not </p><p>yet complied with the demand that they vacate their home, </p><p>although Matonga has threatened to return with a battalion of </p><p>militia if they do not. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Grace Mugabe, wife of President Mugabe, is one of the </p><p>more high-profile beneficiaries of the fast-track </p><p>resettlement effort.  According to a number of press reports, </p><p>Mrs. Mugabe has chosen a farm roughly 30 km northwest of </p><p>Harare which happens to be the site of a new 27-room mansion, </p><p>valued at over Zim $100,000,000 (roughly US $1.6 million), </p><p>fronted by a 2 hectare "well-manicured garden."  The </p><p>dispossessed couple, both in their seventies, described the </p><p>house and grounds as their "lifetime\'s work."  Mrs. Mugabe </p><p>reportedly visited the farm last week, found it acceptable, </p><p>and the couple was notified yesterday that Mrs. Mugabe would </p><p>be sending people to fetch the keys for her. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) In all of this, the fate of the 500,000 or so </p><p>commercial farm workers remains unclear.  Some reports </p><p>indicate that the impoverished people displaced by the newest </p><p>wave of GOZ actions could be as high as 100,000.  Other </p><p>reports indicate that some displaced farm workers are </p><p>informally joining settlers on other occupied farms since </p><p>they have no food, no place in the communal lands, and </p><p>nowhere else to go.  In an indication that the GOZ does not </p><p>want the enormity of this problem to be recognized, post </p><p>received yet another report that a tent city being erected by </p><p>an NGO outside of Harare for some of the dispossessed farm </p><p>workers was abruptly shut down by the Zimbabwe Republic Army </p><p>with claims that "This land belongs to us...."  There are no </p><p>authoritative numbers, but the problem of internally </p><p>displaced persons is growing and the precarious situation of </p><p>these forgotten victims will undoubtedly be exacerbated by </p><p>the growing food shortages. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment:  Although the reports of displacement and </p><p>arrests of commercial farmers have tapered down, there is </p><p>little doubt that the GOZ will continue along this path. </p><p>Many commercial farmers remain determined to challenge their </p><p>forced removal from their property in the courts, and the </p><p>courts are displaying varying degrees of support for the </p><p>farmers\' arguments.  However, police, settlers, and war vets </p><p>are showing no respect for court orders or judgments, and </p><p>their stance mirrors the GOZ\'s pronouncements that it will </p><p>only recognize judgments with which it agrees.  The numbers </p><p>of displaced farm workers could grow very quickly over the </p><p>next several weeks, and the international community should be </p><p>prepared to respond to their needs.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
