(C) Further to Reftel, Poloff February 7 discussed the </p><p>lack of attorney/family access to jailed PKK/KADEK leader </p><p>Abdullah Ocalan with Kaan Esener, head of the MFA\'s </p><p>Department of Council of Europe Affairs.  Esener claimed that </p><p>a series of mechanical failures and high seas have grounded </p><p>the ferry that shuttles visitors every Wednesday to Imrali </p><p>Island in the Sea of Marmara, where Ocalan is the only </p><p>prisoner.  Ocalan last received visitors November 27.  "None </p><p>of Ocalan\'s attorneys or relatives" had been denied </p><p>permission to visit.  MFA is concerned about Ocalan\'s </p><p>isolation, and the strong reaction it has evoked in the </p><p>southeast.  MFA officials have contacted their counterparts </p><p>in the Justice and Interior ministries and urged them to find </p><p>a way to arrange a visit as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In response to a question, Esener said he is aware of </p><p>rumors that Ocalan is dead, but said Justice Ministry </p><p>officials have assured MFA that Ocalan is in good health. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
