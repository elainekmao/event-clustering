Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) On March 31, the GON awarded Motorola a $49.9 </p><p>million contract to expand Nigerian </p><p>Telecommunications\' (NITEL) cellular telephone </p><p>network. This award is a major advocacy victory for </p><p>the Mission as well as an important landmark on </p><p>Nigeria\'s road to greater transparency.  It is the </p><p>most significant U.S. investment in the non-oil sector </p><p>in recent years.  However, this achievement was not </p><p>easy.  Some important players within the GON did not </p><p>want Motorola to get this attractive slice of the </p><p>cellular network. President Obasanjo had to reverse a </p><p>late February decision by the Federal Executive </p><p>Council (FEC) that awarded the lion\'s share of the </p><p>network expansion to traditional non-U.S. telecom </p><p>companies and he reopened bidding after complaints </p><p>that the GON\'s bid tendering process had not been </p><p>transparent.  Motorola believes it is now well </p><p>positioned to take advantage of Nigeria\'s booming </p><p>telecom sector.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT MAKES THINGS RIGHT </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>2. (C) On March 6, the GON retracted its February </p><p>announcement awarding the three largest contracts for </p><p>NITEL\'s Global System Mobile (GSM) expansion to </p><p>Siemens, Alcatel and ZTE.  Losing bidders (Motorola, </p><p>Ericsson) and diplomatic missions had expressed </p><p>concern that the selection process was not </p><p>transparent. Oronsaye admitted to the Ambassador that </p><p>NITEL and Communications Ministry officials had </p><p>brokered side deals favoring certain telecom </p><p>companies, business-as-usual in the Nigerian telcom </p><p>sector that had cost the country billions of dollars </p><p>and deprived the consumer an expansive and efficient </p><p>telcom network.  Oronsaye said President Obasanjo was </p><p>unhappy with the situation and was determined to </p><p>correct it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) On March 10, Oronsaye held a lengthy meeting </p><p>at the Presidential Villa where all bidders </p><p>technically pre-qualified by NITEL and the Ministry of </p><p>Communications resubmitted their final offers. </p><p>Oronsaye and his staff judged each bid solely on price </p><p>and financing. Econoff, who attended the session, </p><p>observed that Oronsaye made every attempt to clarify </p><p>the process and ensure each bidder was treated </p><p>equally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MOTOROLA WINS $49.9 MILLION CONTRACT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>4. (SBU) At the end of the meeting, Oronsaye released </p><p>spreadsheets to the participants indicating Motorola, </p><p>Ericsson, and ZTE were the low-bidders for each part </p><p>of the three-phase expansion. The GON awarded Motorola </p><p>a $49.9 million contract to implement Phase II of </p><p>NITEL\'s $155.5 million GSM three-phase infrastructure </p><p>expansion. Motorola will also supply an additional $7 </p><p>million in equipment to NITEL\'s other partners. </p><p>Motorola, Ericsson (Phase I), and ZTE (Phase III) won </p><p>almost equal shares in the expansion which will add an </p><p>additional 1.2 million mobile lines over the next six </p><p>months to NITEL\'s present 118,500 GSM line network. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) By reopening the bidding process the GON </p><p>saved over $21 million. The initial NITEL/GSM awards </p><p>totaled $176.7 million compared to the renegotiated </p><p>award total of $155.5 million. Representatives from </p><p>ZTE, Siemens and Huawei confirmed to Econoff that the </p><p>GON received rock bottom prices, but since Nigeria\'s </p><p>potential GSM market is so large, companies were </p><p>willing to initially lose money or give considerable </p><p>discounts in order to establish a market share. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SORE LOSERS </p><p>----------- </p><p>6. (C) Following the announcement that Motorola, </p><p>Ericsson and ZTE had won, Embassy sources indicated </p><p>that Siemens tried to overturn Oronsaye\'s decision. A </p><p>Siemens\' official revealed to Econoff in mid-March </p><p>that the company had already spent $6 to $7 million on </p><p>the deal, apparently on bribes. The French Ambassador </p><p>lobbied senior GON officials on Alcatel\'s behalf. </p><p>Oronsaye said he and other officials at the Presidency </p><p>came under intense pressure from Vice President Atiku </p><p>to favor Siemens. Vice President Atiku has strong </p><p>financial connections to both Siemens and Ericsson. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: A LANDMARK ON THE ROAD TO TRANSPARENCY FOR GON </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>7. (SBU) The award to Motorola marked a symbolic and </p><p>important step on Nigeria\'s road to greater </p><p>transparency in awarding government contracts. Spurred </p><p>by the President, senior-level Nigerian officials, at </p><p>least in this case, refused to conduct business as </p><p>usual.  Now a key will be whether this is a harbinger </p><p>of things to come or just a unique and unfortunately </p><p>isolated instance of priority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MOTOROLA SAYS MISSION ADVOCACY EFFORTS KEY TO SUCCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>8. (SBU) During 2001, the Mission advocated for </p><p>Motorola\'s bid on the initial NITEL GSM roll-out </p><p>contract. Under a process that lacked transparency, </p><p>Motorola lost the contract (Refs. B, C, and D). In </p><p>late September 2002, Motorola Country Director Raphael </p><p>Udeogu told the Ambassador his concern that Motorola\'s </p><p>original $230 million bid to expand NITEL\'s GSM </p><p>infrastructure was not assessed fairly by the GON </p><p>(Ref. A).  Motorola filed an advocacy request with the </p><p>Department of Commerce Advocacy Center, and shortly </p><p>after, Ambassador Jeter and EconOff met Udeogu to </p><p>discuss how to move. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) In December 2002, the Ambassador wrote </p><p>President Obasanjo asking the GON to consider </p><p>Motorola\'s NITEL proposal. The letter stated that, </p><p>"giving the contract to less competitive and less </p><p>qualified bidders would not serve anyone\'s interest, </p><p>and frankly creates an impression that American </p><p>companies outside of the oil sector are not welcome in </p><p>Nigeria". On January 14, Secretary of Commerce Evans </p><p>wrote a similar letter to Communications Minister </p><p>Bello. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Throughout early 2003, the Mission remained </p><p>in regular contact with Motorola officials. In mid- </p><p>March, the DCM telephoned Vice President Atiku, </p><p>stressing the need to treat Motorola\'s bid fairly. The </p><p>Ambassador also spoke with Oronsaye on several </p><p>occasions on Motorola\'s behalf. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) On April 4, the Ambassador met with </p><p>Motorola\'s Nigeria Country Director Raphael Udeogu, </p><p>Regional Finance Director Ben Melican, Senior </p><p>Technical Sales Manger Noel Kirkaldy, and Systems </p><p>Integration Manager Manuel Millan for a final readout </p><p>of the NITEL/GSM deal. The team thanked the Ambassador </p><p>and the entire Mission for our advocacy on Motorola\'s </p><p>behalf. The team agreed with the Ambassador that this </p><p>contract presented a huge opportunity for Motorola and </p><p>was a turning point in Nigerian telecom. Udeogu stated </p><p>that without the Mission\'s and Washington\'s efforts, </p><p>Motorola probably would have not secured this </p><p>important contract. After over two years advocating </p><p>for U.S. companies, Motorola\'s contract marked the </p><p>Mission\'s first major transaction outside the oil </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND: NIGERIA\'S MASSIVE TELECOM POTENTIAL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>12. (SBU) Motorola\'s Noel Kirkaldy stressed to the </p><p>Ambassador the importance Motorola attached to winning </p><p>the NITEL/GSM bid. Kirkaldy stated that Motorola, with </p><p>this contract, was only scratching the surface of the </p><p>Nigerian market. Nigeria is on the verge of a </p><p>telecommunications explosion; now Motorola is well </p><p>placed to participate in the boom. Motorola is </p><p>projecting that the Nigerian market will expand to 13 </p><p>million lines in 5 years, adding an additional 20 </p><p>million lines in 10 years, Udeogu stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) The low teledensity in Nigeria offers telecom </p><p>companies enormous profit opportunities. Mobile </p><p>players have an advantage, given NITEL\'s decaying </p><p>fixed-telecom infrastructure. Even conservatively, </p><p>most analysts say the Nigerian market could grow to </p><p>over 10 million cellular subscribers in a few years. </p><p>Moreover, mobile providers in Nigeria have charged </p><p>some of the highest per minute rates in Africa. Most </p><p>telecom companies have recouped their initial </p><p>investments in Nigeria in six months to two years. </p><p>14. (U) With Nigeria\'s 126 million population, </p><p>Nigerians will likely benefit when per minute rates </p><p>begin to fall the more new users sign-up for service. </p><p>(When Obasanjo assumed office in 1999, investment in </p><p>the telecom sector was $50 million compared to over </p><p>$2.1 billion in 2002). With NITEL\'s GSM expansion, </p><p>NITEL itself can now share in the profits of Nigeria\'s </p><p>expanding telecom sector. Motorola is also well poised </p><p>to tap into the business created by 35 to 40 million </p><p>cell phone users by 2013. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  This transaction has been a win-win outcome </p><p>for everyone; Motorola will profit handsomely; the </p><p>Nigerian consumer stands to reap benefits from the </p><p>availability and declining costs of telcom services; </p><p>finally, after years of non-transparency in the telcom </p><p>sector which have drained Nigeria of billions of </p><p>dollars, the chain of corruption, by government </p><p>officials and companies alike, finally may have been </p><p>broken. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
