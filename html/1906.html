<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002115 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/22/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KCRM, KWMN, NI, WCAR </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED DICUSSES THE WCAR, </p><p>TRAFFICKING AND HIV/AIDS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 1921 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 2113 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by PolMilOff, called on </p><p>NSA Aliyu Mohammed on August 22.  LTC Idris, the NSA\'s </p><p>Military Advisor also attended.  This message summarizes </p><p>their discussion on the WCAR, trafficking in persons, and </p><p>HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==== </p><p>WCAR </p><p>==== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Mohammed stated that he had talked to Dr. Condoleeza </p><p>Rice and to NSC Senior Africa Director Frazer on the WCAR. </p><p>Nigeria planned to attend the conference in Durban (the </p><p>President would lead the delegation), but would not support </p><p>any demands for reparations, point fingers at Israel, or </p><p>equate Zionism with racism.  He hoped the U.S. would attend </p><p>the conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador Jeter thanked Mohammed for Nigeria\'s </p><p>commendable efforts at the Geneva PrepCom to make the WCAR </p><p>forward looking rather than dwelling on the past.  It was </p><p>clear that some progress had been made in Geneva, but it </p><p>appeared that hard-line positions on the Middle East might </p><p>still overshadow the good that might come out of the </p><p>conference.  This was particularly unfortunate since it could </p><p>detract from a serious international effort to work against a </p><p>serious international problem.  Mohammed said the GON would </p><p>continue to do all it could to move the WCAR in a positive </p><p>direction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============================================= ====== </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKING CONFERENCE: INVITATION TO PRESIDENT </p><p>BUSH </p><p>============================================= ====== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Mohammed stated that Nigeria was planning to host an </p><p>international conference on human trafficking in May, April </p><p>or June of 2002.  President Obasanjo took trafficking very </p><p>seriously, and was planning to meet with some of the 40 women </p><p>returned from Italy via Guinea that afternoon.  He noted that </p><p>three witnesses were being brought from Guinea to assist in </p><p>the prosecution of the traffickers, but lamented that Nigeria </p><p>did not have a strong law against traffickers or their </p><p>illegal activities.  He said, however, that the President was </p><p>sending a Bill to the National Assembly to increase the </p><p>penalties against traffickers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The NSA then mentioned President Bush\'s letter </p><p>responding to President Obasanjo\'s invitation to visit </p><p>Nigeria (dated July 2, 2001).  Mohammed, smiling, said that </p><p>if President Bush came to Africa next year, the GON hoped he </p><p>would visit Nigeria.  If President Bush were planning a trip </p><p>to the Continent, the GON would schedule the trafficking </p><p>conference to coincide with his visit so the President could </p><p>address the gathering, if President Bush desired to do so. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Ambassador Jeter said he would pass this message to </p><p>Washington.  The Ambassador informed the NSA that the Embassy </p><p>would host an inter-Mission conference on trafficking in </p><p>October in Lagos, to begin the development of a USG strategy </p><p>on trafficking involving West Africa.  The NSA was very </p><p>supportive, and stated that after President Obasanjo\'s trip </p><p>to China, he would like the Embassy to sit down with him and </p><p>his staff to plan the agenda for the 2002 international </p><p>conference.  (NOTE: Later that evening, Ambassador Jeter </p><p>mentioned the Embassy\'s trafficking conference to the World </p><p>Bank Representative, Mark Tomlinson.  Tomlinson stated that </p><p>the World Bank would be most interested in joining this </p><p>event.  END NOTE). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======== </p><p>HIV/AIDS </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador Jeter said he was very concerned that not </p><p>enough was being done to make ordinary Nigerians aware of the </p><p>risks of HIV/AIDS, or the GON\'s clear commitment to fighting </p><p>the disease.  He informed the NSA that he planned to suggest </p><p>to the President that he hold a conference with all 36 </p><p>governors to raise the profile of the HIV/AIDS issue in </p><p>Nigeria, a proposal that had been put to him by several </p><p>health NGO\'s working in Nigeria.  The NSA said the President </p><p>had allocated USD 10 million to the Nigerian Council on </p><p>HIV/AIDS, of which the President is Chairman.  He also said </p><p>that President Obasanjo had directed that free condoms be </p><p>distributed to all Nigerian soldiers participating in </p><p>peacekeeping missions. </p><p>8. (U) Freetown minimize considered. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
