(C) ITALIAN MFA ARMS CONTROL EXPERTS, MEETING WITH A/S </p><p>RADEMAKER ON SEPTEMBER 25, WELCOMED THE NEW US POSITION ON </p><p>THE 5TH BWC REVCON.  AFTER RECEIVING CLARIFICATION OF THE </p><p>PHILOSOPHY UNDERLYING THE US APPROACH TO THE BWC, AND </p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR SKEPTICISM THAT THE NAM WOULD ACCEPT AN </p><p>AGREED WESTERN GROUP POSITION, ITALY PROMISED TO WORK TOWARD </p><p>ONE IN NEW YORK.  US UNWILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE DID NOT SIT </p><p>WELL, HOWEVER, AND ITALY REMAINS SKEPTICAL THAT THE BWC CAN </p><p>BE STRENGTHENED WITHOUT SOME SORT OF VERIFICATION REGIME. </p><p>THE MFA\'S LEAD ARMS CONTROL NEGOTIATOR TOLD A/S RADEMAKER </p><p>THAT A 10 MINUTE MEETING AT THE NOVEMBER 11 REVCON WOULD BE </p><p>DISASTROUS FROM A PUBLIC RELATIONS PERSPECTIVE.  MFA </p><p>POLITICAL DIRECTOR ARAGONA SAID THE WG SHOULD WORK TOWARD A </p><p>COMMON POSITION IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO INSURE THAT </p><p>THE ONUS OF FAILURE AT THE REVCON WOULD NOT FALL ON IT.  HE </p><p>ASSURED THE A/S THAT ITALY\'S BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH THE US </p><p>WOULD IN NO WAY BE DAMAGED BY DIFFERENCES OVER THE BWC. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON CTBT, ITALY WILL CONTINUE ITS PUSH FOR </p><p>UNIVERSALIZATION AND BELIEVES THAT US NON-RATIFICATION GIVES </p><p>PAKISTAN AND INDIA AN EXCELLENT EXCUSE FOR NOT JOINING THE </p><p>NPT.  ITALY IS COMMITTED TO REINVIGORATING THE OPCW AND WANTS </p><p>THE 2003 CWC REVCON TO FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON EVALUATING ITS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04887  01 OF 03  080737Z </p><p>WORK RATHER THAN OPENING UP A REVIEW OF THE CONVENTION. </p><p>ESPECIALLY AFTER THE NATO-RUSSIA SUMMIT, ITALY BELIEVES THE </p><p>ALLIES SHOULD BE MORE SENSITIVE TO RUSSIA\'S VIEWS ON CFE. </p><p>THE RUSSIANS WILL NOT MOVE UNTIL THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT THE </p><p>POLITICAL WILL TO RATIFY THE ADAPTED TREATY EXISTS, ONE </p><p>ITALIAN OFFICIAL ARGUED.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>PARTICIPANTS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  ON SEPTEMBER 25, A/S RADEMAKER MET WITH MINISTER </p><p>CARLO TREZZA, MFA COORDINATOR FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND </p><p>DISARMAMENT.  TREZZA WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MINISTER ALESSANDRO </p><p>CEVESE, DIRECTOR OF THE MFA ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT </p><p>OFFICE, AND COUNSELOR PAOLO CUCULI, A MEMBER OF CEVESE\'S </p><p>STAFF.  POL-MIL COUNSELOR ROBBINS AND POLOFF (NOTETAKER) ALSO </p><p>PARTICIPATED.  FOLLOWING THE CONSULTATIONS, A/S RADEMAKER MET </p><p>BRIEFLY WITH MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS </p><p>(ALSO POLITICAL DIRECTOR), GIANCARLO ARAGONA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>BWC 5TH REVCON - GRASPING OPPORTUNITY </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  A/S RADEMAKER BEGAN THE DISCUSSION BY CONVEYING REF </p><p>(B) POINTS.  IN DOING SO, HE STRESSED THAT THE US IS NOT OPEN </p><p>TO NEGOTIATION, BUT WILL CONSIDER PROPOSALS IN THE HOPE THAT </p><p>A COMMON WESTERN GROUP POSITION CAN BE AGREED.  IN THAT VEIN, </p><p>THE A/S LEFT NO ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT THE US EXPECTED WG </p><p>MEMBERS TO STAND BY AN AGREED POSITION THROUGHOUT THE REVIEW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04887  01 OF 03  080737Z </p><p>PROCESS.  HE REFERRED HIS INTERLOCUTORS TO THE NINE ELEMENTS </p><p>OF THE 2001 US PAPER FOR IDEAS ON WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THE US RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CALL FOR A SHORT </p><p>MEETING ON NOVEMBER 11 IF THIS NEW WAY FORWARD SPUTTERS OR </p><p>OTHERWISE RUNS UP AGAINST US REDLINES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  TREZZA EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE GESTURE, BUT </p><p>SAID HE WANTED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PHILOSOPHY UNDERLYING </p><p>THE US APPROACH TO THE BWC BEFORE MOVING INTO SPECIFICS. </p><p>VERIFICATION, TREZZA SUGGESTED, HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ESSENTIAL </p><p>ELEMENT OF ARMS CONTROL TREATIES.  INDEED, ITALY HAS ALWAYS </p><p>INSISTED ON IT.  RESPONDING TO TREZZA\'S CONCERN THAT "US </p><p>SKEPTICISM TOWARD THE VALUE OF INSPECTIONS AND VERIFICATION </p><p>APPEARS TO BE GROWING," A/S RADEMAKER RESPONDED THAT THE US </p><p>COMMITMENT TO A ROBUST OPCW AND IAEA ENFORCEMENT ROLE SHOULD </p><p>BE SUFFICIENT TO DISPROVE THAT IDEA. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  SATISFIED THAT VERIFICATION IS STILL A CORE CONCEPT </p><p>IN THE US APPROACH TO ARMS CONTROL, TREZZA ASKED WHY THE BWC </p><p>STANDS OUT AS AN EXCEPTION.  A/S RADEMAKER EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS ARE UNIQUE; BIO-DEFENSE WORK--ALLOWED </p><p>UNDER THE BWC--IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM PROHIBITED OFFENSIVE </p><p>WORK.  THE LAWFULNESS OF SUCH ACTIVITY TURNS ON INTENT, WHICH </p><p>IS NOT READILY SUSCEPTIBLE TO VERIFICATION.  MOREOVER, THE </p><p>BIOTECH SECTOR IN THE UNITED STATES HAS A POWERFUL INTEREST </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4105 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04887  02 OF 03  080738Z </p><p>ACTION AC-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   M-00     NRRC-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SS-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------F33A8D  080738Z /38 </p><p>P 080701Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6209 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION UNVIE VIENNA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 004887 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR A/S RADEMAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, CBW, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S RADEMAKER\'S ITALY CONSULTATIONS </p><p> </p><p>IN PROTECTING AGAINST INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE.  CEVESE ALLOWED </p><p>THAT THIS LATTER CONCERN HAD ALSO BEEN RAISED BY ITALIAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04887  02 OF 03  080738Z </p><p>INDUSTRY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) TREZZA AVERRED THAT ALL MAJOR MULTILATERAL ARMS </p><p>CONTROL TREATIES TO DATE HAVE BEEN BASED ON DEALS.  CAN WE </p><p>AVOID COMPROMISING OVER THE BWC, HE ASKED?  EXACTLY, A/S </p><p>RADEMAKER RESPONDED, WE PROBABLY COULD NOT; THIS IS WHY THE </p><p>US IS OPPOSED TO THE PROTOCOL.  ADVANCED INDUSTRIALIZED </p><p>NATIONS WOULD HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING TO THE NAM IN EXCHANGE </p><p>FOR AN UNVERIFIABLE PROTOCOL -- A VERY BAD BARGAIN INDEED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MOVING PAST THEOLOGY, TREZZA FIRST DISMISSED THE </p><p>NOTION OF HOLDING A "10 MINUTE SESSION" AS LACKING IN </p><p>CREDIBILITY.  WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO CRITICISM FROM THE PRESS </p><p>AND FROM PUBLIC OPINION IF WE GO DOWN THAT ROAD, HE ARGUED, </p><p>ADDING THAT THE WESTERN GROUP WOULD APPEAR TO BE ON THE </p><p>DEFENSIVE IF IT SHOWS UP IN GENEVA UNPREPARED TO DISCUSS </p><p>SUBSTANCE.  ITALY ALSO BELIEVES THAT "NAMING NAMES" IS </p><p>PROBLEMATIC.  IT IS NOT OPPOSED TO BEING EXPLICIT IF CALLING </p><p>COUNTRIES ON THE CARPET CAN BE DONE THROUGH AN AGREED </p><p>INSTRUMENT, BUT DOES NOT VIEW UNILATERAL STATEMENTS AS </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IN TERMS OF ARRIVING AT A COMMON POSITION, WESTERN </p><p>STATES HAVE ALWAYS DEFENDED THE POSITION OF VERIFICATION, </p><p>ACCORDING TO TREZZA, WHO ADDED, "IT WILL BE RATHER </p><p>EMBARRASSING TO REVERSE THIS POSITION SIMPLY BECAUSE THE US </p><p>DOES NOT AGREE."  CEVESE WAS FLUMMOXED BY THE US "TAKE IT OR </p><p>LEAVE IT" APPROACH AND WAS CLEARLY CONCERNED THAT THE US </p><p>DELEGATION IN NEW YORK FOR THE FIRST COMMITTEE SESSION CANNOT </p><p>NEGOTIATE.  NEVERTHELESS, HE PROMISED THE A/S THAT ITALY </p><p>WOULD EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF ARRIVING AT A COMMON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04887  02 OF 03  080738Z </p><p>POSITION. CEVESE SAID THAT IF THE US COULD NOT BE MOVED TO </p><p>SHOW EVEN MORE FLEXIBILITY, IT WOULD BE ESSENTIAL TO PROVE </p><p>THAT THE BWC IS IMPORTANT EVEN WITHOUT A VERIFICATION </p><p>MECHANISM.  A REALISTIC FOLLOW UP PROCESS AT THE EXPERT LEVEL </p><p>IS NEEDED, HE ARGUED.  CEVESE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>USEFUL TO CREATE A MECHANISM WITHIN THE BWC TO FURTHER THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) CUCULI RAISED SEVERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES.  ITALY </p><p>UNDERSTANDS THAT ROUTINE VISITS COULD ENDANGER INTELLECTUAL </p><p>PROPERTY RIGHTS, BUT LIMITING INSPECTIONS TO SEVERE </p><p>VIOLATIONS MIGHT BE LESS HARMFUL.  EXPOSING VIOLATORS IS THE </p><p>CRUX OF THE MATTER AND BWC ARTICLE 6 PROCEDURES HAVE NOT </p><p>WORKED.  ITALY IS CONFIDENT THAT THE US, FRANCE, AND THE UK </p><p>WILL NOT PLAY THE VETO CARD IN THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, BUT </p><p>IS LESS SANGUINE ABOUT RUSSIA AND CHINA.  IF WE REJECT A NEW </p><p>VERIFICATION REGIME DO WE REALLY WANT TO RELY ON NATIONAL </p><p>LEGISLATION?  THE CASE OF CUBA, WHICH HAS TOUGH LEGISLATION </p><p>ON THE BOOKS, SHOULD BE INSTRUCTIVE, CUCULI ARGUED.  ITALY </p><p>SUPPORTS THE PROTOCOL BECAUSE THE BWC DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH </p><p>PROTECTION. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE US IS NOT PERSUADED THAT OTHER STATES SHARE OUR </p><p>SKEPTICISM ON INSPECTIONS, A/S RADEMAKER RESPONDED, WHICH IS </p><p>WHY THE US HAS LIMITED ITSELF TO ARTICLE V UNDER THE BWC. </p><p>THE US POSITION IS THAT THE BWC IS UNVERIFIABLE; TO TRY AND </p><p>MAKE IT SO IS TECHNICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>CTBT - STILL PERPLEXED </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04887  02 OF 03  080738Z </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  CEVESE SAID ITALY BELIEVES THE CTBT WOULD BE AN </p><p>IMPORTANT DETERRENCE MECHANISM, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT IS </p><p>POSSIBLE TO DETECT WHETHER NUCLEAR TESTING IS BEING </p><p>CONDUCTED.   ITALY STRONGLY SUPPORTS UNIVERSALIZING THE CTBT </p><p>AND IS "DEMARCHING EVERYONE" ON THE SUBJECT.  CEVESE </p><p>INSINUATED THAT US NON-RATIFICATION IS AN IMPEDIMENT TO ARMS </p><p>CONTROL IN SOUTHWEST ASIA.  WHY SHOULD INDIA AND PAKISTAN </p><p>RATIFY IF THEY KNOW FULL WELL THAT THE US HAS NO INTENTION OF </p><p>DOING SO?  AT THE 2000 NPT REVCON ALL STATES PARTIES AGREED </p><p>THAT THE CTBT WAS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF A SUCCESSFUL NPT. </p><p>WITH A FUNCTIONING CTBT IT MIGHT EVEN BE POSSIBLE BRING INDIA </p><p>AND PAKISTAN INTO THE NPT, CEVESE ARGUED. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  IN RESPONSE, A/S RADEMAKER ASSURED CEVESE THAT THE </p><p>US SHARES ITALY\'S CONCERNS ABOUT INDIA AND PAKISTAN, ALTHOUGH </p><p>IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT STRIPPING AWAY PRETEXTS WILL </p><p>CONVINCE EITHER COUNTRY TO JOIN THE NPT.  THE US SUPPORTS A </p><p>FISSILE MATERIAL CUTOFF TREATY (FMCT) IN PART AS A MEANS OF </p><p>ADDRESSING THE NUCLEAR PROBLEM IN SOUTHWEST ASIA. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>CWC -- FOCUS ON OPCW </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4106 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04887  03 OF 03  080738Z </p><p>ACTION AC-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   M-00     NRRC-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SS-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SSD-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------F33A92  080738Z /38 </p><p>P 080701Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6210 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION UNVIE VIENNA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 004887 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR A/S RADEMAKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/07/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, CBW, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S RADEMAKER\'S ITALY CONSULTATIONS </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  ITALY IS COMMITTED TO TURNING AROUND OPCW, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR REESTABLISHING A ROBUST VERIFICATION SYSTEM.

IT IS NOT </p><p>TIME TO MODIFY THE CWC, CEVESE ASSERTED.  ITALY WANTS TO </p><p>AVOID GIVING THE NAM AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN DISCUSSION OF THE </p><p>CONVENTION AS SUCH, AND EXPECTS CHINA TO HONOR ITS </p><p>PRINCIPLES.  CEVESE ALSO RAISED THE ISSUE OF THIRD COUNTRY </p><p>CHALLENGES, AND SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO MILITARY VESSELS IN </p><p>ITALIAN WATERS.  HE ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION OF THE US </p><p>POSITION.  A/S RADEMAKER AGREED TO CHECK ON SPECIFICS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>CFE -- WINKING AT RUSSIA </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) ITALY EXPECTED THAT SOMETHING IMPORTANT WOULD HAVE </p><p>CHANGED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE  NATO-RUSSIA SUMMIT.  WE </p><p>SHOULD TRY TO BE MORE POSITIVE AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION </p><p>RUSSIAN CONCERNS, CEVESE SUGGESTED.  THE ARGUMENT THAT THE </p><p>ADAPTED TREATY CANNOT ENTER INTO FORCE UNTIL GEORGIA AND </p><p>MOLDOVA RATIFY IT IS FALLACIOUS, BECAUSE "ALL CONCERNED" KNOW </p><p>THAT PRESSURE FROM NATO MEMBERS WILL BRING THEM AROUND.  WE </p><p>NEED TO DEMONSTRATE TO RUSSIA THAT THERE IS POLITICAL WILL </p><p>BEHIND RATIFICATION BEFORE MOSCOW WILL INITIATE ITS OWN </p><p>PROCESS, CEVESE SAID.  ITALY, HOWEVER, REJECTS ANY LINKAGE </p><p>BETWEEN ENLARGEMENT AND RATIFICATION BY THE BALTIC STATES. </p><p>A/S RADEMAKER INFORMED CEVESE THAT THE US POSITION IS </p><p>STRAIGHTFORWARD: RUSSIA FIRST NEEDS TO IMPLEMENT FULLY ITS </p><p>ISTANBUL COMMITMENTS.  HE URGED CEVESE TO CONSIDER THE </p><p>HARMFUL EFFECTS IF NATO SOLIDARITY ON THIS CORE ISSUE </p><p>DISINTEGRATES. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04887  03 OF 03  080738Z </p><p>--------- </p><p>LANDMINES </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) CEVESE ASKED IF ITALY COULD EXPECT ANY FORTHCOMING </p><p>CHANGE IN THE US POSITION ON THE OTTAWA CONVENTION.  A/S </p><p>RADEMAKER SAID THAT WHILE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT </p><p>REVERSE THE US POSITION, LANDMINE POLICY WAS UNDER REVIEW AND </p><p>ITALY WOULD PROBABLY LIKE THE CONCLUSIONS THAT SHOULD BE </p><p>RELEASED SOON. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>ARAGONA MEETING </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.

NEVERTHELESS, AFTER LISTENING TO A/S </p><p>RADEMAKER\'S REVIEW OF THE NEW US POSITION, HE DIRECTED CEVESE </p><p>TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO ARRIVE AT A COMMON POSITION.

NEVERTHELESS, HE WAS UNEASY ABOUT THE US NOTION </p><p>THAT A COMMON POSITION MUST BE CAST IN STONE BECAUSE THIS </p><p>WILL MAKE CONDUCTING NEGOTIATIONS DIFFICULT.  ARAGONA </p><p>REASSURED A/S RADEMAKER THAT ITALY\'S CURRENT DIFFERENCES WITH </p><p>THE US OVER THE BWC WILL NOT AFFECT BILATERAL RELATIONS. </p><p>INDEED, ITALY WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SAFEGUARD AND </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04887  03 OF 03  080738Z </p><p>18.
