SUMMARY - ACTING PERMREP AND AG COUNSELOR MET WITH TOP </p><p>LEVEL FAO OFFICIALS TO EXPRESS GRAVE CONCERN WITH </p><p>GUIDANCE THAT IS BEING DISSEMINATED IN SOUTHERN AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTRIES BY FAO REPRESENTATIVES.   FAO\'S MIXED MESSAGE </p><p>HAS MADE LOCAL GOV\'T OFFICIALS MORE RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT </p><p>U.S. FOOD AID LIKELY TO CONTAIN GENETICALLY MODIFIED (GM) </p><p>CORN.  US PERMREP URGED FAO TO CLARIFY GUIDANCE TO THE </p><p>FIELD.   FAO OFFICIALS PROMISED TO INFORM DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>(DG) JACQUES DIOUF OF U.S. DEMARCHE, BUT WE BELIEVE </p><p>RESPONSE MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO REMOVE DOUBTS ABOUT GM </p><p>CONTENT OF FOOD AID.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. US PERM REP AND AG COUNSELOR MET ON AUGUST 7 WITH SENIOR </p><p>ADVISOR TO FAO DG MICHEL SAVINI AND ASSISTANT DG LOUISE </p><p>FRESCO TO URGE FAO TO TAKE THE LEAD IN ALLEVIATING </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT GM CONTENT OF U.S. FOOD AID TO SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICAN COUNTRIES.  THE UNITED STATES HAS RECEIVED A </p><p>NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT REPORTS FROM RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS </p><p>IN THE FIELD INDICATING THAT FAO REPRESENTATIVES IN THE </p><p>REGION HAVE BEEN ADVISING GOVERNMENTS ON FOOD SAFETY </p><p>ASPECTS OF GM CORN.  FURTHERMORE, WHAT IS MOST DISTURBING </p><p>IS THAT THIS ADVICE MAY BE CONTRARY TO ACCEPTED FAO </p><p>POLICY.  IT APPARENTLY DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT </p><p>CURRENT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE CONCEDES THAT THERE IS NO RISK </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03899  01 OF 02  090535Z </p><p>TO HUMAN HEALTH FROM GM FOODS, A RESULT WHICH IS </p><p>ESPECIALLY CRUCIAL IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT CRISIS IN </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICA.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN </p><p>CONFUSED ABOUT POTENTIAL RISKS WHICH HAS GENERATED FEAR </p><p>AND LED TO INACTION. </p><p> </p><p>3. SAVINI AGREED WITH U.S. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SITUATION </p><p>IN SOUTHERN AFRICA BUT STATED FAO HAD ALREADY TAKEN </p><p>REMEDIAL ACTION.  HE CITED THE DG\'S LETTER DATED JULY 25 TO </p><p>UN UNDER SECRETARY FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS OSHIMA </p><p>(ALSO SENT TO U/S ALAN LARSON UNDER A SEPARATE COVER </p><p>LETTER DATED JULY 31) WHICH AIMED AT CORRECTING </p><p>MISINFORMATION CONTAINED IN HIS JULY 10TH LETTER.  THE </p><p>EARLIER LETTER\'S REFERENCE TO THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL </p><p>APPEARS TO BE AMONG REASONS FOR MISLEADING INFORMATION </p><p>BEING PROVIDED BY FAO REPRESENTATIVES TO AFRICAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  IN THE U.S. VIEW, THE JULY 25 LETTER </p><p>STILL PROVIDES NO CLEAR GUIDANCE ON FOOD SAFETY ASPECTS </p><p>OF GM FOODS. </p><p> </p><p>4. FODAG OFFICIALS URGED FAO TO ISSUE CLEAR GUIDANCE TO </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES IN ALL SOUTHERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES </p><p>AFFECTED BY DROUGHT IMMEDIATELY TO COUNTERACT CURRENT </p><p>CONFUSION.   SAVINI REMARKED THAT THE DG COULD NOT </p><p>ENDORSE GMO\'S BEFORE THE REVIEW PROCESS UNDERWAY IN </p><p>CODEX ALIMENTARIUS IS COMPLETED WITHOUT RISKING </p><p>POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS AT THE NEXT FAO COUNCIL MEETING. </p><p>U.S. REP COUNTERED THAT THERE COULD ALSO BE ADVERSE </p><p>REACTION IF PEOPLE ARE STARVING DUE TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS </p><p>RELUCTANCE TO ACCEPT U.S. FOOD AID.  ADG FRESCO COMMENTED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03899  01 OF 02  090535Z </p><p>THAT AT MOST, THE FAO COULD SAY THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE </p><p>THAT ANY ILL EFFECTS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO GMO\'S SINCE </p><p>GMO\'S APPEARED ON THE U.S. MARKET IN THE 1990\'S. </p><p> </p><p>5. THE U.S REPRESENTATIVES AGAIN URGED FAO TO USE ITS VOICE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RESPECT AND AUTHORITY TO SPEAK OUT </p><p>CLEARLY AND FORCEFULLY TO POLICY MAKERS AND OTHER </p><p>OPINION LEADERS ON THE SCIENTIFIC REALITY OF GM FOODS.  THE </p><p>UNITED STATES BELIEVES THIS COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN </p><p>RELIEVING HUMAN SUFFERING IN THE CURRENT CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>6. SAVINI ASKED FOR SPECIFIC INSTANCES WHERE MISINFORMATION </p><p>ALLEDGEDLY HAD BEEN PROVIDED TO HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS BY THE FAO.  THE U.S. REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT WAS </p><p>BESIDE THE POINT.  RATHER, ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN TO </p><p>CORRECT MISINFORMATION PROMULGATED TO DATE.  SAVINI </p><p>PROMISED TO CONVEY U.S. CONCERNS TO DG DIOUF, WHO IS OUT </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY, BUT COULD NOT PREDICT HIS WHAT HIS </p><p>REACTION MIGHT BE. </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENT - WE ARE NOT OPTIMISTIC TANGIBLE ACTION WILL </p><p>RESULT FROM OUR DEMARCHE, BUT WE BELIEVE WE DID BREAK </p><p>THROUGH THE FAO\'S COMPLACENT ATTITUDE.  WE ARE MORE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTO5911 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03899  02 OF 02  090535Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  USNW-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00   OIGO-00  E-00     UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01     SSA-01   TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /013W </p><p>                  ------------------D6CFF1  090535Z /38 </p><p>R 090531Z AUG 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5324 </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>SADC COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 003899 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM US MISSION TO UN AGENCIES ROME </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR IO, PRM, DEPT.
