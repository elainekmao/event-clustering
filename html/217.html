<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TUNIS 05278 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, TS </p><p>SUBJECT:  RAMADAN IN TUNISIA:  OBSERVANCE AND </p><p>          TOLERANCE </p><p> </p><p>1. C O N F I D E N T I A L -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN ITS FIRST RAMADAN SINCE COMING TO POWER LAST </p><p>FALL, THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS BROKEN WITH THE </p><p>SECULARISM OF THE PREVIOUS REGIME AND ACTIVELY </p><p>PROMOTED RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES.  IN DOING SO, HOWEVER, </p><p>IT HAS ENCOURAGED TOLERANCE OF NON-FASTING MOSLEMS </p><p>AND TOURISTS.  GOT\'S MEASURES CREATED AN </p><p>UNPRECEDENTED ESPRIT DE CORPS AMONG TUNISIANS WHO </p><p>OBSERVED THE HOLY MONTH.  THE PROMOTION OF SUCH </p><p>RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES REFLECTS NOT ONLY PIETY, BUT </p><p>ALSO A DESIRE TO STEAL THE THUNDER FROM ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>GOT PROMOTES RAMADAN </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. PRESIDENT ZINE EL ABIDINE BEN ALI AND HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAVE BROKEN WITH THE PREVIOUS REGIME\'S </p><p>SECULAR APPROACH TO RAMADAN.  UNDER BOURGUIBA, GOT\'S </p><p>OFFICIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE HOLY MONTH WAS AT BEST </p><p>NEUTRAL.  ONCE, WHEN THE FORMER PRESIDENT APPEARED ON </p><p>NATIONAL TV DRINKING A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE AND </p><p>DISPARAGING RAMADAN AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO DEVELOPMENT, </p><p>IT WAS OPENLY HOSTILE.  THIS DISTANCING FROM RAMADAN </p><p>OBSERVANCE WAS ALWAYS OUT OF STEP WITH THE FOLKWAYS </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY.  TUNISIANS, HOWEVER, HAD SUCH RESPECT </p><p>FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT THAT HIS SECULARISM DID NOT </p><p>POSE A MAJOR POLITICAL PROBLEM UNTIL LATE IN HIS RULE. </p><p> </p><p>4. BY CONTRAST, THIS YEAR THE GOT HAS ACTIVELY </p><p>REVIVED TUNISIA\'S CUSTOMS AND FOLKWAYS REGARDING </p><p>RAMADAN.  EARLY ON THE GOT DROPPED THE CALENDAR </p><p>METHOD (BASED ON SCIENTIFIC CALCULATIONS) USED BY THE </p><p>PREVIOUS REGIME TO DETERMINE THE ONSET AND END OF THE </p><p>MONTH AND OPTED FOR THE SIGHTING METHOD (BASED ON </p><p>ACTUAL HUMAN SIGHTING OF THE NEW MOON) WHICH IS </p><p>CONSIDERED MORE TRADITIONAL.  (ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS HAD LONG CHAMPIONED THE SIGHTING </p><p>METHOD).  GOT ALSO RETURNED TO THE TUNISIAN CUSTOM OF </p><p>USING CANON BLASTS TO ANNOUNCE THE BEGINNING AND </p><p>BREAKING OF THE DAILY FASTS.  FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE </p><p>FRENCH LANGUAGE TELEVISION STATION CARRIED A LARGE </p><p>NUMBER OF RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS.  FURTHER, GOT ORDERED </p><p>THE REHABILITATION OF 190 MOSQUES AND SPONSORED </p><p>CONCERTS AND OTHER CULTURAL ACTIVITIES AT NIGHT IN </p><p>THE TUNIS MEDINA DURING THE ENTIRE MONTH.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS PROMINENTLY </p><p>ATTENDED LOCAL CEREMONIES. </p><p> </p><p>5. TOWARDS NON-FASTING MOSLEMS AND TOURISTS, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE GOT FOLLOWED THE TOLERANT POLICY OF THE PREVIOUS </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THIS RAMADAN (17 APRIL - 15 MAY) </p><p>CORRESPONDED WITH THE START OF THE TOURIST SEASON, </p><p>AND THE HOTELS AND OTHER FACILITIES THAT CATER TO </p><p>TOURISTS OPERATED NORMALLY.  AS UNDER BOURGUIBA, </p><p>DRINKING AND SMOKING OUTSIDE CAFES WERE EFFECTIVELY </p><p>DISCOURAGED, BUT THE LARGER CAFES WERE PACKED INSIDE </p><p>WITH NON-FASTING TUNISIANS.  PUBLIC BARS STOPPED </p><p>SERVING ALCOHOL, AND ONE MAJOR BAR DOWNTOWN WAS </p><p>VEILED TO HIDE CLIENTS SMOKING CIGARETTES AND </p><p>DRINKING SOFT DRINKS.  SOME OF THE SMALLER </p><p>RESTAURANTS AND CAFES CLOSED BY PERSONAL CHOICE.  AS </p><p>BEST WE CAN DETERMINE, THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAJOR </p><p>EXCEPTION.  ISLAMISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY HARASSED </p><p>STUDENTS WHO DID NOT OBSERVE THE FAST, BUT SUCH </p><p>HARASSMENT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RESTRICTED TO THE </p><p>CAMPUSES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>FOR THE PUBLIC, A "LIGHT" RAMADAN </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. SEVERAL AVERAGE TUNISIANS HAVE DESCRIBED THIS </p><p>YEAR\'S RAMADAN TO US AS "LIGHT" (KHFIF), IE, AN EASY </p><p>ONE.  THE MILD WEATHER OVER THE PAST MONTH </p><p>CONTRIBUTED SOMEWHAT.  THE GOT\'S MEASURES, HOWEVER, </p><p>CREATED AN ESPRIT DE CORPS AMONG THOSE WHO BORE THE </p><p>INCONVENIENCE OF THE FAST THAT DID NOT EXIST UNDER </p><p>BOURGUIBA.  EXPLAINING THIS ESPRIT DE CORPS, </p><p>TUNISIANS MENTION THE SIGHTING METHOD WHICH ENABLED </p><p>EVERYONE TO START AND END RAMADAN AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>THUS AVOIDING THE SOCIAL AWKWARDNESS OF SOME FASTING </p><p>AND OTHERS NOT.  THEY ALSO SAY THAT GOT\'S REVIVAL OF </p><p>LOCAL TRADITIONS, WITH THE NOSTALGIA AND AWARENESS OF </p><p>A SHARED CULTURAL HERITAGE THE TRADITIONS EVOKED, </p><p>FOSTERED A SENSE OF TOGETHERNESS.  PARENTS HAVE </p><p>REMARKED, FOR EXAMPLE, THEIR SATISFACTION IN TAKING </p><p>CHILDREN OUT TO LOOK FOR THE NEW MOON AND EXPLAINING </p><p>ITS SIGNIFICANCE.  BEN ALI\'S APPEARANCE AT RELIGIOUS </p><p>CEREMONIES AND THE UNPRECEDENTED MEDIA COVERAGE </p><p>SHOWED THAT THEY WERE NOT ALONE IN FASTING.  AT </p><p>EMBASSY FUNCTIONS, WESTERNIZED TUNISIANS OF THE ELITE </p><p>WHO ORDINARILY DRINK ALCOHOL ABSTAINED AND REMARKED </p><p>THAT MORE OF THEIR FRIENDS WERE OBSERVING RAMADAN </p><p>THAN BEFORE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>COMMENT: GOT GETS IN SYNC WITH POPULAR RELIGION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>7. GOT\'S APPROACH TO RAMADAN IS THE LATEST INDICATION </p><p>THAT IT WANTS TO GET IN SYNC WITH POPULAR RELIGIOUS </p><p>SENTIMENT.  EARLIER EXAMPLES INCLUDED BEN ALI\'S </p><p>NUMEROUS GESTURES TO ISLAM AND AND THE HEAVY COVERAGE </p><p>OF THE RELIGIOUS RITES HE PERFORMED WHILE ON A FORMAL </p><p>VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p> </p><p>8. PART OF THIS APPROACH MAY STEM FROM PERSONAL </p><p>PIETY, BUT PART ALSO STEMS FROM A DESIRE TO PREVENT </p><p>ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS FROM BECOMING A GREATER </p><p>POLITICAL FORCE.  GOT HAS ADOPTED THOSE ITEMS OF THE </p><p>ISLAMIC AGENDA THAT MESH WITH TUNISIA\'S TOLERANT </p><p>FOLKWAYS (EG, ISLAMIC INCANTATIONS, VIP ATTENDANCE AT </p><p>RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES, PROMOTION OF RAMADAN, ETC.) BUT </p><p>ESCHEWED THOSE PURITANICAL ITEMS (REVISION OF THE </p><p>PERSONAL STATUS CODE, RESTRICITIONS ON TOURISTS) THAT </p><p>WOULD RADICALLY CHANGE TUNISIA. </p><p> </p><p>PELLETREAU </p><p></p></div>
