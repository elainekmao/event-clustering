<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000646 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/31/2004 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, ELAB, YM, ECON/COM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN\'S ECONOMY: THINKING BEYOND OIL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political/Economic Officer Jill E. Hutchings, for reason </p><p>s 1.5 B. and D. </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) Summary: A forthcoming World Bank sectoral analysis </p><p>of fish, transportation, tourism and labor markets is a </p><p>potential road map for donor projects and steps that the ROYG </p><p>must take in order to diversify and strengthen Yemen\'s </p><p>economy.  The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study examines </p><p>four potential sources of revenue that could make up the </p><p>difference of a projected 30% loss to GDP when oil reserves </p><p>run dry in the next twenty years. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Integrated Framework Program of the World Bank </p><p>will present to the Ministry of Industry and Trade this month </p><p>a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study on four sectors of the </p><p>Yemeni economy: fisheries, transportation, tourism and labor. </p><p>The following is a summary of the report\'s major findings on </p><p>the four sectors with information about under-reported </p><p>aspects of the Yemeni economy. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>FISHERIES </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The fishing industry is the second largest export for </p><p>the ROYG behind oil, employing 42,000 people and supporting </p><p>250,000 dependents. In 2001, the ROYG earned $70 million in </p><p>revenue from the export of fish, contributing 2% to GDP. </p><p>While there are several prospects for expanding this market, </p><p>the report warns against rapid expansion that would deplete </p><p>fish stocks. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) According to the study, Yemeni fish exports are unable </p><p>to receive adequate prices in foreign markets because </p><p>fishermen are unable to maintain the quality of their </p><p>product.  Inadequate storage on boats, transport delays, and </p><p>poor quality control all contribute to a decline in the price </p><p>exporters receive for Yemeni fish.  The most pointed example </p><p>of this problem is the fact that most of the fish bound for </p><p>European markets is shipped out of Sanaa, a four to six hour </p><p>drive from most ports.  Once in Sanaa, exporters rely on </p><p>Yemenia Airlines, whose flight schedule is unreliable and </p><p>ill-equipped to ship large stocks of frozen fish.  In </p><p>response, the World Bank is investing in a project to upgrade </p><p>al-Rayyan airport near Mukallah to allow for more direct </p><p>shipment routes from Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The report also encourages the ROYG to establish a </p><p>Fisheries Council to effectively monitor fish resources </p><p>because, according to the World Bank, the Ministry of </p><p>Fisheries is not adequately staffed or resourced to handle </p><p>its required role. The ROYG is considering, and the Bank </p><p>recommends, privatization of the General Corporation for Fish </p><p>Services and Marketing (CFC), that manages landing slips and </p><p>fish auctions, as a way to raise the standards of quality </p><p>control and fish processing. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Transportation </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Yemen has one of the lowest percentages of paved roads </p><p>in the World (comparable to Niger and Rwanda); therefore </p><p>enhancement of the transport sector is vital to broader </p><p>economic development. The sectoral analysis also notes that </p><p>80% of the Yemeni population live in isolated, rural </p><p>communities and that road injuries cost the ROYG 1-3% of GDP. </p><p> According to the report, women are not attending school and </p><p>entering the workforce because the existing public </p><p>transportation is not considered appropriate for their use. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The chapter on transportation also strongly recommends </p><p>that the ROYG improve port management.  Such improvements are </p><p>necessary because there is increasing competition for the </p><p>Port of Aden. The port managers of Jebel Ali in Dubai are </p><p>beginning to invest heavily in Djibouti, adding more </p><p>competition for the Port of Aden, which has been already seen </p><p>much of its traffic move to Jeddah and Sallalah after the </p><p>October 2002 attack on the French tanker Limburg. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Tourism </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Tourism in Yemen has vast potential and many hurdles, </p><p>including inadequate hotels, few flights from European </p><p>markets, and fears about security. Nevertheless the sector </p><p>may still become a significant contribution to the Yemeni </p><p>economy. The tourism sectoral analysis states that in 2001, </p><p>tourism accounted for 1.7% of GDP and employed 14,000 people. </p><p> After September 11, 2001, tourism decreased by 80%.   The </p><p>biggest area identified for growth was adventure tourism. </p><p>The World Bank recommends increased investment in and </p><p>improvement of rest houses (hotels aimed at tourists) in </p><p>tourism regions, and encouraging conservation efforts which </p><p>could in turn attract more tourists. </p><p>----- </p><p>Labor </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  In 2001, remittances from foreign workers amounted to </p><p>1.2 billion USD, bringing in more foreign currency than oil </p><p>revenues. In 1999, for example, the report states that oil </p><p>revenue was 967 million USD.  The importance of remittances </p><p>is compounded by high domestic unemployment. The 2000 five </p><p>year plan by the ROYG estimated that unemployment was around </p><p>25%, and the Yemen Center for Studies and Research estimates </p><p>that unemployment in 2000 was about 50.3 % of the labor </p><p>force.  (Note: The ROYG\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper </p><p>states that the unemployment rate is about 11.5% of the labor </p><p>force.) Comment: Despite large statistical discrepancies, </p><p>clearly unemployment is a huge challenge for the ROYG. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>10. (C) Female employment, however, continues to grow at a </p><p>rate of about ten percent a year. In 2000, there were nearly </p><p>one million females employed in Yemen. The number of female </p><p>graduates also increased by 189% in ten years with 3,759 </p><p>female graduates in 2,000. The number of women registered at </p><p>universities increased by 153% in ten years to 34,994 in </p><p>2000. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) According to the report, Yemen\'s continued population </p><p>growth will greatly impact its prospects for continued </p><p>economic development. In 2001, 7.8 million (50%) of the </p><p>population were of working age; by 2016, 16.5 million people </p><p>will be of working age.  The World Bank study recommends that </p><p>for the ROYG to find jobs for a doubled work force, it must </p><p>improve its foreign direct investment climate. Furthermore, </p><p>the study encourages the ROYG to expand agreements with other </p><p>countries to increase the number of Yemeni guest workers </p><p>employed in other countries. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Comment: The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study </p><p>prepared by the World Bank for the Ministry of Industry and </p><p>Trade does not explicitly state that its goal is to find </p><p>non-oil revenue sources. However, economists are well aware </p><p>that barring any new discoveries, there is less than twenty </p><p>more years of oil output for Yemen. Planning has clearly </p><p>begun by donor agencies and the Ministry of Industry and </p><p>Trade to find new sources of revenue to compensate for the </p><p>expected loss of oil revenue, which presently accounts for </p><p>32% of Yemen\'s GDP. This report has already served as the </p><p>basis for some of Posts\' planning on how to prioritize future </p><p>development assistance.  Our contacts at the World Bank have </p><p>asked that we keep the analysis confidential until its </p><p>release at the end of April. End Comment. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
