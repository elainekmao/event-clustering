<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 000139 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INL/C: RIGGS AND WERKSMAN, WHA/PPC: HAMANN, </p><p>AND WHA/USOAS: STICKLES. </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCOR, KCRM, SNAR, PREL, PGOV, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: THIRD ANNUAL CORRUPTION REPORT - GUATEMALA </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 STATE 239506 </p><p> </p><p> 1. Summary: Guatemala made limited progress in 2002 in </p><p>implementing its commitments under the Inter-American </p><p>Convention Against Corruption.  The primary obstacle to </p><p>greater progress was the lack of effective leadership on the </p><p>part of the Executive in fighting corruption, and the </p><p>political polarization that heightened confrontation between </p><p>the GOG and its growing number of critics. Transparency </p><p>International rated Guatemala near the bottom (81st out of </p><p>102 countries) of its annual review of public perceptions of </p><p>corruption.  On October 10, 2002, then-WHA Assistant </p><p>Secretary Otto Reich testified to the U.S. Congress that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>corruption has increased under the Portillo Administration </p><p>and had become the primary impediment to the strengthening of </p><p>democracy in Guatemala.  Guatemala\'s cooperation in the war </p><p>on drugs also fell to historically low levels in 2002, in </p><p>large part due to pervasive corruption.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Accomplishments by the Government of Guatemala </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>2. There were a limited number of successes in the GOG\'s </p><p>efforts to control corruption in 2002.  Congress passed two </p><p>important pieces of legislation which make it easier to </p><p>prosecute government officials for corruption.  Both laws </p><p>will come into force in early 2003.  Several other </p><p>transparency measures were proposed in Congress, including </p><p>whistle-blower protections and a mechanism for the </p><p>participation of civil society auditing government </p><p>expenditures, but Congress had not passed these bills by the </p><p>end of the year.  One of the most concrete accomplishments in </p><p>2002 was the implementation of currency declaration forms at </p><p>the International Airport.  This initiative, which was </p><p>intended to help implement new money laundering legislation, </p><p>made it possible for the GOG to prosecute individuals who </p><p>attempt to bring into the country or out of it more that </p><p>10,000 USD without declaring the funds to customs officials. </p><p>While there have been no convictions yet, numerous arrests </p><p>have been made and several cases are going forward to </p><p>prosecution.  The measure creates a significant disincentive </p><p>for money laundering. </p><p> </p><p>3. A further potential accomplishment was the announcement by </p><p>the Attorney General\'s Office that investigations had been </p><p>opened into the activities of five former military officers </p><p>who are believed to be involved in organized crime -- all of </p><p>the individuals are believed to have ties to senior GOG </p><p>officials.  The GOG also announced in 2002 the establishment </p><p>of an ambitious National Anti-Corruption Plan which it </p><p>drafted in coordination with World Bank experts.  This </p><p>project has not yet advanced significantly.  Another </p><p>accomplishment was the disbanding of the special </p><p>counter-narcotics police (the DOAN) in the wake of </p><p>extra-judicial killings and mounting evidence that the DOAN </p><p>was engaged in selling seized drugs.  One of the most </p><p>promising recent accomplishments was the GOG\'s naming of a </p><p>blue-ribbon Transparency Commission composed of several </p><p>respected members of civil society.  GOG efforts to </p><p>manipulate the commission, however, have led to threats by </p><p>several members to resign and have brought into question the </p><p>efficacy of the commission. </p><p> </p><p>Accomplishments of Civil Society </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Civil society was an active player in the anti-corruption </p><p>debate in Guatemala in 2002.  Some civil society actors were </p><p>motivated by their focus on strengthening the democratic </p><p>institutions and processes of the state, and others by a more </p><p>partisan interest in discrediting a government whose levels </p><p>of corruption have been higher than Guatemalans are used to. </p><p>The primary accomplishment of civil society groups in </p><p>anti-corruption efforts in 2002 has been to keep the issue of </p><p>government corruption in public view, primarily through use </p><p>of the news media.  This initiative has helped overcome </p><p>traditionally high levels of apathy on the part of the </p><p>general population.  Press coverage of corruption scandals </p><p>was relentless.  In February, the "Foro Guatemala," a civil </p><p>society organization encompassing representatives of most </p><p>organized sectors of Guatemalan society, held a major </p><p>conference on the effects of corruption.  The results of </p><p>several studies were compiled and released with great </p><p>fanfare.  The theme of the conference has not had the </p><p>expected resonance among the population, however, and shortly </p><p>after the conference a national opinion poll found that only </p><p>41% of Guatemalans agreed that acts of corruption should be </p><p>denounced when detected.  A banking scandal involving shell </p><p>corporations in Panama established in the names of the </p><p>President and Vice President, among others, resulted in the </p><p>formation of a loose coalition of small political parties and </p><p>civil society leaders known as the Civic Movement Aganist </p><p>Corruption ("Moviemento Civico Contra la Corrupcion").  The </p><p>movement did not take root, however, when they failed to </p><p>mobilize significant participation in anti-corruption </p><p>protests on the Presidential Palace to demand the resignation </p><p>of the President and Vice President. </p><p>Hamilton </p><p></p></div>
