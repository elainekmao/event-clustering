<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BEIJING 007008 </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR LIEBERTHAL/KEITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/22/2009 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, CH </p><p>SUBJECT:  FALUN GONG CRACKDOWN, DAY THREE </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  A) BEIJING 6941, B) FBIS OW2207035699, </p><p> </p><p>(U)  CLASSIFIED BY JAMES F. MORIARTY, ACTING DEPUTY CHIEF </p><p>OF MISSION.  REASON:  1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  IMPLEMENTING A DECISION OF THE POLITBURO STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ON JULY 22 OFFICIALLY </p><p>ANNOUNCED A BAN ON THE FALUN GONG SECT, DECLARING IT AN </p><p>"ILLEGAL" ORGANIZATION.  THOUSANDS OF SECT MEMBERS TOOK </p><p>TO BEIJING\'S STREETS IN DEMONSTRATIONS THAT WERE </p><p>NOTEWORTHY FOR THE GENERAL RESTRAINT AMONG PROTESTERS AND </p><p>POLICE ALIKE.  FEW PRACTITIONERS OFFERED RESISTANCE AS </p><p>POLICE CORRALLED AND LOADED THEM ONTO BUSES.  MANY </p><p>REPORTEDLY ARE BEING HELD IN STADIUMS IN WESTERN BEIJING, </p><p>ALTHOUGH FOR NOW WE BELIEVE THESE ARE TEMPORARY HOLDING </p><p>SITES, FROM WHICH PROTESTERS WILL SOON BE SENT HOME.  THE </p><p>REGIME\'S STRATEGY APPEARS TO BE TO SEEK TO NEUTRALIZE THE </p><p>FALUN GONG BY DECAPITATING ITS CORE LEADERSHIP, WHILE </p><p>REFRAINING FROM REPRESSION OF ORDINARY MEMBERS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>BEIJING CLEARLY HOPES THAT THE CULT WILL DISAPPEAR </p><p>WITHOUT RESISTANCE, IT MAY HAVE TO RECONSIDER THIS </p><p>STRATEGY IF PRACTITIONERS CONTINUE TO TAKE TO THE STREETS </p><p>AND GATHER IN PARKS FOR DAILY EXERCISES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p></p><p>FALUN GONG OFFICIALLY ILLEGAL </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  DURING A NATIONAL BROADCAST AT 3:00 P.M. ON JULY </p><p>22, CHINA CENTRAL TELEVISION (CCTV) ANNOUNCED AN OFFICIAL </p><p>BAN ON THE FALUN GONG MOVEMENT.  CCTV READ A CIRCULAR </p><p>ISSUED BY THE MINISTRIES OF CIVIL AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY WHICH DECLARED THAT FALUN GONG WAS AN "ILLEGAL" </p><p>ORGANIZATION AND BANNED FURTHER PUBLIC GATHERINGS. </p><p>CHINESE MEDIA REPORTEDLY PLAN TO REPEAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>REGULARLY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  AN MFA SPOKESWOMAN </p><p>ALSO ANNOUNCED THE BAN DURING THE MINISTRY\'S REGULAR </p><p>PRESS BRIEFING THIS AFTERNOON. </p><p> </p><p>POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE DECISION </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  ACCORDING TO A WELL-CONNECTED SOURCE, THE </p><p>POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE APPROVED THE SUPPRESSION OF </p><p>FALUN GONG DURING A JULY 19 MEETING.  AS REPORTED REF A, </p><p>SECURITY FORCES ARRESTED DOZENS OF SECT LEADERS </p><p>NATIONWIDE THE NEXT DAY.  AS OF JULY 21, GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>PARTY OFFICIALS HAD BEGUN TO ATTEND MANDATORY SESSIONS TO </p><p>STUDY AN AUTHORITATIVE STATEMENT ON THE FALUN GONG </p><p>DELIVERED BY STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBER HU JINTAO ON JULY </p><p>19.  HU REPORTEDLY ASSERTED THAT THERE WERE 2.1 MILLION </p><p>FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS, OF WHOM ONE-THIRD WERE PARTY </p><p>MEMBERS.  THE OFFICIAL GUIDANCE INSTRUCTED PARTY MEMBERS </p><p>WHO PRACTICED FALUN GONG EITHER TO HALT THEIR INVOLVEMENT </p><p>IN THE SECT OR RESIGN FROM THE PARTY.  THOSE WHO FAILED </p><p>TO COMPLY WOULD BE EXPELLED FROM THE PARTY. </p><p> </p><p>JIANG "PREOCUPPIED" BY FALUN GONG </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4 (C)  IN HIS STATEMENT, HU JINTAO REPORTEDLY CITED KEY </p><p>REMARKS ON THE FALUN GONG BY PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY </p><p>JIANG ZEMIN.  ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE, JIANG ASSERTED </p><p>THAT HE HAD RECENTLY BEEN "PREOCCUPIED" WITH THE PROBLEM </p><p>OF FALUN GONG BECAUSE ITS FOUNDER, LI HONGZHI, WAS A </p><p>"SWINDLER OF THE HIGHEST ORDER."  THE PARTY GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY REPORTEDLY ACCUSED LI HONGZHI OF EXPLOITING </p><p>"DECEITFUL TRICKS AND HERESY TO CONFUSE PEOPLE AND TALK </p><p>NONSENSE."  "SOME" PRACTITIONERS, JIANG CLAIMED, </p><p>"OBSTINATELY STUCK TO THE WRONG COURSE," AND FALUN GONG </p><p>WAS AN "IMMENSELY HARMFUL" (WEIHAI JIDA) GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>FOCUSING ON THE LEADERSHIP </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  MEDIA REPORTS SUGGESTED THAT THE CHINESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAD DETAINED THOUSANDS ACROSS CHINA ON JULY 21 </p><p>AND 22, AS PRACTITIONERS TOOK TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST </p><p>THEIR LEADERS\' ARRESTS.  AFP ANNOUNCED THAT LARGE </p><p>DETENTION CENTERS HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN STADIUMS IN </p><p>WESTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN BEIJING (REF B).  OUR WELL- </p><p>CONNECTED CONTACT PREDICTED THAT THE AUTHORITIES WOULD </p><p>RELEASE THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THESE PERSONS. </p><p>CITING A TRADITIONAL CHINESE SAYING THAT A MASS OF </p><p>DRAGONS WAS EASILY COWED WHEN IT HAD NO LEADERS (QUN LONG </p><p>WU SHOU), HE ASSERTED THAT BEIJING BELIEVED THE SECT </p><p>COULD EASILY BE CONTROLLED ONCE ITS CORE LEADERSHIP WAS </p><p>NEUTRALIZED.  HU JINTAO, HE NOTED, HAD DECLARED THAT THE </p><p>PARTY INTENDED TO STRIKE HARD AGAINST "A VERY SMALL </p><p>NUMBER" OF PRACTITIONERS. </p><p> </p><p>FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS:  BUSINESS AS USUAL </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  DESPITE THE CRACKDOWN, HUNDREDS OF FALUN GONG </p><p>MEMBERS AGAIN GATHERED IN MAJOR CITY PARKS THIS MORNING </p><p>TO CONDUCT THEIR DAILY PROGRAM.  POLOFFS OBSERVED GROUPS </p><p>NUMBERING AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED IN THE TEMPLE OF </p><p>EARTH, TEMPLE OF HEAVEN, AND PURPLE BAMBOO GARDEN PARKS </p><p>(IN NORTHERN, WESTERN, AND SOUTHERN BEIJING, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY).  AS USUAL, PRACTITIONERS OF OTHER SCHOOLS </p><p>OF QIGONG REMAINED DISTINCTLY SEPARATE FROM THE FALUN </p><p>GONG AND EACH OTHER.  IN THE TEMPLE OF EARTH PARK, POLOFF </p><p>WATCHED AS PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY PERSONNEL OBSERVED AND </p><p>VIDEOTAPED FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS.  APPARENTLY </p><p>UNCONCERNED ABOUT THIS OFFICIAL ATTENTION, THE SECT </p><p>MEMBERS WORKED THROUGH TO THE CONCLUSION OF THEIR PROGRAM </p><p>AND SOCIALIZED BRIEFLY BEFORE QUIETLY BREAKING UP. </p><p> </p><p>PROTESTS NEAR ZHONGNANHAI CONTINUED </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  THE AUTHORITIES WERE, NONETHELESS, WELL-PREPARED </p><p>TO DEAL WITH CONTINUED PROTESTS.  AT ABOUT 8:00 A.M., </p><p>POLOFF OBSERVED A CROWD OF APPROXIMATELY 500 </p><p>PRACTITIONERS GATHERED ON XI\'ANMEN STREET NEAR THE </p><p>NORTHWESTERN CORNER OF THE ZHONGNANHAI LEADERSHIP </p><p>COMPOUND.  ITS MEMBERS WERE PACKED SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER </p><p>ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE DEEP ON THE SIDEWALK, WITH THEIR BACKS </p><p>TO THE SHOPS ALONG THE STREET.  ABOUT 200 UNIFORMED </p><p>POLICE OFFICERS SURROUNDED THEM ON THE OTHER THREE SIDES. </p><p>OBSERVING THIS STAND-OFF FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, POLOFF </p><p>WITNESSED NO VIOLENCE FROM EITHER SIDE.  THE </p><p>PRACTITIONERS REMAINED LARGELY SILENT, WHILE THE POLICE </p><p>OFFICERS MOSTLY CHATTED AMONG THEMSELVES.  THE POLICE </p><p>PERMITTED REGULAR PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE TRAFFIC TO PASS </p><p>THE AREA UNHINDERED. </p><p> </p><p>FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS ALLOWED TO COME AND GO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  THE ATMOSPHERE AT THIS SITE WAS COMPARATIVELY </p><p>RELAXED.  IN FACT, POLICE OFFICERS PERMITTED ABOUT A </p><p>DOZEN PRACTITIONERS TO CROSS THE SECURITY PERIMETER AND </p><p>LEAVE THE SCENE AND ANOTHER DOZEN OR SO TO JOIN THE </p><p>CROWD.  POLOFF OBSERVED PRACTITIONERS ENGAGING IN BANTER </p><p>AND EVEN EXTENDED CONVERSATIONS WITH POLICE OFFICERS. </p><p> </p><p>FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS CHEERED AS BUSED AWAY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  TWO LARGE ARTICULATED BUSES ARRIVED AT THE SCENE </p><p>AT ABOUT 8:15 A.M., AND POLICE OFFICERS PROMPTLY BEGAN </p><p>LOADING THE CROWD ONTO THEM.  FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS </p><p>APPARENTLY BOARDED VOLUNTARILY.  WHEN THE FULLY-LOADED </p><p>BUSES PULLED OUT, THEIR PASSENGERS AND SECT MEMBERS </p><p>REMAINING ON THE STREET CHEERED AND APPLAUDED.  THIS </p><p>SCENE REPEATED ITSELF APPROXIMATELY EVERY 15 MINUTES, </p><p>UNTIL BUSES HAD CARRIED AWAY THE REMAINDER OF THE CROWD. </p><p> </p><p>PROTESTERS FROM THE NORTHEAST, GOING BACK </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) DURING A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF, A POLICE </p><p>OFFICER ON BREAK SAID HE HAD BEEN AT THE SCENE SINCE </p><p>ABOUT 6:00 A.M.  AT ITS PEAK, THE OFFICER STATED, THE </p><p>CROWD HAD TOTALED APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND </p><p>PRACTITIONERS.  MOST, HE STATED, WERE FROM OUTSIDE OF THE </p><p>BEIJING MUNICIPAL REGION. (AN ELDERLY RESTAURANT WORKER </p><p>SEPARATELY TOLD POLOFF THAT THE PROTESTERS WERE FROM </p><p>NORTHEASTERN CHINA).  ASKED WHERE THE BUSES WERE CARRYING </p><p>THE PRACTITIONERS, THE PSB OFFICER SAID MERELY THAT THE </p><p>PROTESTERS WOULD BE SENT BACK TO WHERE THEY HAD COME </p><p>FROM. </p><p> </p><p>ONE INCIDENT OF STRONG-ARM TACTICS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  POLOFFS OBSERVED ONLY ONE ACT OF POLICE VIOLENCE </p><p>IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY.  AT A POLICE STATION NEAR </p><p>ZHONGNANHAI, OFFICERS REPEATEDLY STRUCK A 60-YEAR OLD MAN </p><p>ON HIS BACK WITH A NIGHT STICK WHEN HE REFUSED TO BOARD A </p><p>BUS.  THE MAN QUICKLY GAVE IN AND JOINED HIS FELLOW </p><p>PROTESTERS ON THE VEHICLE. </p><p> </p><p>SCENE REPEATED THROUGHOUT THE DAY </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C)  WE BELIEVE THAT PROTESTS OCCURRED THROUGHOUT </p><p>BEIJING DURING THE COURSE OF JULY 22.  A WESTERN NEWS </p><p>MAGAZINE\'S BUREAU CHIEF TOLD US THAT SHE HAD OBSERVED </p><p>POLICE DETAIN AND BUS AWAY A CROWD THAT INITIALLY </p><p>NUMBERED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE.  DRIVING THROUGH </p><p>DOWNTOWN BEIJING IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON, POLOFF COUNTED </p><p>DOZENS OF EMPTY BUSES PARKED ALONG CHANG\'AN BOULEVARD -- </p><p>THE MAIN EAST-WEST ARTERY -- IN DOWNTOWN BEIJING.  THE </p><p>POLICE HAD SET UP TEMPORARY POSTS AT INTERSECTIONS, AND </p><p>POLOFF OBSERVED OFFICERS STOPPING PEDESTRIANS AND </p><p>INSPECTING THEIR IDENTIFICATION CARDS.  ACROSS THE STREET </p><p>FROM THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO ZHONGNANHAI, POLOFF WATCHED AS </p><p>POLICE LOADED APPROXIMATELY EIGHT CITIZENS INTO A POLICE </p><p>VAN.  TWO OF THE EIGHT BRIEFLY ARGUED WITH THE POLICE, </p><p>BUT NONE OFFERED ANY PHYSICAL RESISTANCE AND ALL QUICKLY </p><p>BOARDED THE VEHICLE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)  THE CRACKDOWN ON FALUN GONG IN BEIJING TODAY </p><p>APPEARED TO BE REACTIVE, AS AUTHORITIES DETAINED </p><p>PRACTITIONERS WHO TOOK TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST THE JULY </p><p>20 ARRESTS.  ALTHOUGH WE DOUBT THAT THE INCIDENT CITED IN </p><p>PARA 11 WAS THE SOLE OCCASION WHEN POLICE EMPLOYED </p><p>VIOLENCE, BOTH THE FALUN GONG AND THE POLICE DISPLAYED </p><p>NOTEWORTHY RESTRAINT IN WHAT WAS CLEARLY A POTENTIALLY </p><p>UNSTABLE SITUATION.  FOR NOW, WE ARE INCLINED TO ACCEPT </p><p>OUR CONTACT\'S ASSERTION THAT THE AUTHORITIES WILL SOON </p><p>RELEASE THE MANY RANK-AND-FILE FALUN GONG MEMBERS </p><p>DETAINED SO FAR DURING THE PROTESTS.  THE SITUATION </p><p>NONETHELESS WILL REMAIN FLUID FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT FEW </p><p>DAYS.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN, FOR INSTANCE, IF FALUN GONG </p><p>PRACTITIONERS -- HOWEVER ORDERLY -- REFUSE TO RETURN HOME </p><p>AND ABANDON THEIR PROTESTS?  NOW THAT FALUN GONG </p><p>ACTIVITIES ARE BANNED, HOW WILL THE REGIME DEAL WITH CULT </p><p>MEMBERS WHO OPENLY GATHER IN PARKS TO CONDUCT DAILY </p><p>EXERCISES?  BEIJING SURELY HOPES THAT THE SECT WILL GO </p><p>QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT, BUT THIS ALMOST CERTAINLY IS </p><p>WISHFUL THINKING.  ZHONGNANHAI MAY SOON DECIDE IT HAS NO </p><p>CHOICE BUT TO ABANDON ITS COMPARATIVE RESTRAINT IN FAVOR </p><p>OF A TOUGHER APPROACH. </p><p> </p><p>MCCAHILL </p><p></p></div>
