<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 001333 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA SENIOR ADVISER JENDAYII FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ZI, ZANU-PF </p><p>SUBJECT: SIMBA MAKONI ON ZIMBABWEAN CRISIS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5b/d </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Former Finance Minister and still ZANU-PF Politburo </p><p>member Simba Makoni called on the Ambassador July 1.  Makoni, </p><p>who recently lost his 23-year old son to suicide, told the </p><p>Ambassador July 1 that he was focused on family and his </p><p>growing consultancy business and  relatively disconnected </p><p>from politics these days.  Makoni, who has relatively little </p><p>political power, is rumored likely to lose his politburo seat </p><p>soon.  He is mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, </p><p>most often as the candidate of ZANU-PF heavyweight Solomon </p><p>Mujuru to stop the presidential candidacy of Emmerson </p><p>Mnangagwa.  Makoni said that President Mugabe\'s recent public </p><p>statement calling for an open and above-board campaign for </p><p>presidential succession had stimulated more open discussion </p><p>of succession in the party. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C)  Makoni acknowledged that another factor was slowing </p><p>down resolution of Zimbabwe\'s crisis.  The fact that no clear </p><p>succession path exists in ZANU-PF has tended to slow any </p><p>actual progress toward transition.  Makoni said that this </p><p>absence of a solution  often makes it seem like the GOZ </p><p>leadership feels no urgency at all to deal with the country\'s </p><p>crisis.  Makoni believed that the South Africans and other </p><p>Africans were in the best position to deliver ar a solution </p><p>in Zimbabwe.  But he compared the efforts of President Mbeki </p><p>seeking to find a solution with Mugabe to that which he often </p><p>faced as Finance Minister in dealing with President Mugabe on </p><p>economic issues. The President would say: "yes, yes, yes" as </p><p>they discussed a possible solution, but then never act to </p><p>implement what they had discussed.  Makoni said it was as if </p><p>the economic and political crises were beyond the Zimbabwean </p><p>leadership\'s ability to solve or even confront. Nonetheless, </p><p>Makoni thought that African leaders were in the best position </p><p>to advance and help deliver a resolution.  He added that </p><p>Secretary Powell\'s mention (in his "OP-Ed") of US and other </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>donor assistance to a transitional Zimbabwean Government was </p><p>positive. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C)  Makoni was aware of the debate over how effective a </p><p>coalition transitional government could be prior to new </p><p>elections.  He hoped that it could be effective in laying out </p><p>the path to realistic and pragmatic economic and political </p><p>solutions.  He also believed that in addressing the damage of </p><p>the land redistribution exercise, a transitional government </p><p>might be better positioned than an elected ZANU-PF or MDC </p><p>government to set a new direction.  Makoni believed that the </p><p>existing land review commission headed by former Cabinet </p><p>Secretary Charles Utete would do a good and respectable job </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>of assessing problems in the land redistribution exercise, </p><p>but had no ability to implement the necessary corrections. </p><p>Nor did Makoni believe that the current Mugabe Government had </p><p>the political will to implement tough recommendations. </p><p>Makoni said: "One more Commission report to sit on the </p><p>shelf." </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment:  Makoni has little political weight of his own </p><p>and is not in position to advance his own political </p><p>ambitions.  If his name emerges as a serious candidate, it </p><p>will be because others like Mujuru push him forward. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
