<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000030 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAGR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: FOOD CLASHES IN URBAN AREAS </p><p> </p><p> 1.  SUMMARY: Last week, police, national youth service </p><p>members, and ordinary citizens clashed over food in two of </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s most populous cities--Bulawayo and Chitungwiza. </p><p>The two incidents signal an increased level of tension </p><p>surrounding food availability and access, particularly in the </p><p>case of Bulawayo where ZANU-PF youths and war veterans </p><p>attacked the Grain Marketing Board depot. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>BULAWAYO: ZANU-PF VS. ZANU-PF - A BATTLE FOR ACCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>2.  On January 2, police tear-gassed about 4000 people--led </p><p>by ZANU-PF militia (Green Bombers) and war veterans--who had </p><p>besieged the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) depot demanding </p><p>transparency in the distribution of corn, according to the </p><p>independent newspaper The Daily News.   Daily News reporter, </p><p>Chris Gande, told us that the demonstrators had complained to </p><p>him that the corn was only going to the top ZANU-PF </p><p>politicians. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Thirty-nine people were arrested on Friday, January 3, </p><p>placed in custody and were being arraigned on Monday, January </p><p>6, when PolOff spoke with Gande.  Gande said the Green </p><p>Bombers and war veterans tried to hold another demonstration </p><p>near the courthouse on January 6 but were dispersed by riot </p><p>police.  Gande also claimed riot police and roadblocks had </p><p>been deployed on roads leading to the courthouse.  (NOTE: </p><p>PolOff has not been able to corroborate this last claim. END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  Welshman Ncube, MDC Secretary-General and MP of Bulawayo </p><p>North East, told us the demonstrators were attacked by police </p><p>at the GMB depot.  Ncube said demonstrators told him they </p><p>were frustrated and despondent over the lack of food in the </p><p>city. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>CHITUNGWIZA: ZANU-PF VS. POLICE - A BATTLE FOR CONTROL </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>5.  In Chitungwiza, ZANU-PF youth attacked police manning a </p><p>corn meal queue at an area shopping center on January 5. </p><p>According to Executive Mayor of Chitungwiza, Misheck Shoko, </p><p>the youths wanted to control the distribution of the corn </p><p>meal.  Members of the public helped the police fend off the </p><p>Green Bombers, who sought refuge in a nearby church.  After </p><p>getting reinforcements from the church members, the Green </p><p>Bombers returned and attacked people and shops </p><p>indiscriminately. </p><p> </p><p>6.  In a telephone conversation with PolOff, Shoko said he </p><p>had spoken with police and asked them why they had not </p><p>arrested anyone.  The police claimed they could not arrest </p><p>the youths and church members because they were outnumbered </p><p>and would be overwhelmed.  Shoko also told PolOff that some </p><p>members of the church had been arrested after they went to </p><p>the police station claiming that the MDC instigated the </p><p>melee.  Shoko--who witnessed the entire event--said there </p><p>were no discernible MDC members in the area--just ordinary </p><p>residents trying to buy corn. </p><p> </p><p>7.  PolOff asked Shoko about the mood in Chitungwiza and </p><p>whether he thought additional food disturbances might be </p><p>expected.  Shoko said the situation is very tense but that he </p><p>does not think riots will happen in the near future.  He said </p><p>the army is patrolling the shopping center in question and </p><p>that people are too afraid to be at the forefront of a battle </p><p>with the police or armed forces.  Even though Shoko did not </p><p>believe riots were imminent, he did think that one day the </p><p>GOZ would be unable to control the frustrations and </p><p>desperation of area residents and riots would ensue. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>8.  Although independent press reports somewhat overplayed </p><p>these incidents, the food clashes over the last week suggest </p><p>a growing popular frustration with food shortages and with </p><p>profiteering by ruling party politicians with access to </p><p>scarce supplies.  The Bulawayo incident with ZANU-PF </p><p>supporters marching on the ZANU-PF-run GMB to demand </p><p>transparency in distributions is most likely indicative of </p><p>the sentiments of a larger proportion of the ruling party </p><p>constituency.  In Chitungwiza, the intervention of ordinary </p><p>residents on behalf of the police suggests a diminishing </p><p>threshold for willingness to confront their tormentors.  The </p><p>incidents in Bulawayo and Chitungwiza reveal the potential of </p><p>growing food queues as likely flashpoints for civil unrest. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
