<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 004987 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMBASSADOR MCDONALD FOR AF/S DIRECTOR RENDER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/07/10 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S HEALTH </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MCDONALD.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 171074 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04987  080946Z </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) WE HAVE HEARD RECENT RUMORS CIRCULATING IN HARARE </p><p>THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE COLLAPSED -- IN PRIVATE -- THREE </p><p>TIMES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS -- ONCE IN MAPUTO AND </p><p>TWICE MORE IN TRIPOLI WHILE EN ROUTE TO NEW YORK FOR THE </p><p>MILLENIUM SUMMIT.  PRESS REPORTS, CITING ANONYMOUS SOURCES </p><p>IN THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE, HAVE SPECULATED THAT MUGABE </p><p>SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK, A STROKE, OR A SUICIDE ATTEMPT. </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN GEORGE CHARAMBA DISMISSED THE </p><p>SPECULATION, ATTRIBUTING IT TO "APRIL FOOLS," AND </p><p>PRONOUNCED MUGABE "FIT AS A FIDDLE." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WE CANNOT CONFIRM WHETHER MUGABE DID IN FACT </p><p>COLLAPSE, BUT WE DO NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE </p><p>COULD BE SUFFERING FROM FATIGUE OR EXHAUSTION.  HE HAS HAD </p><p>A FULL TRAVEL SCHEDULE DURING THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS, WITH </p><p>VISITS TO MAPUTO, TRIPOLI, PARIS, AND NEW YORK.  WE NOTE </p><p>THAT, FROM OUR DISTANT PERSPECTIVE, THE PRESIDENT DID NOT </p><p>APPEAR TO HAVE ANY SERIOUS PHYSICAL AILMENT DURING HIS BUSY </p><p>SCHEDULE OF PUBLIC APPEARANCES WHILE ON HIS CURRENT VISIT </p><p>TO NEW YORK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) RUMORS ABOUT MUGABE\'S HEALTH SURFACE REGULARLY </p><p>HERE.  WE, HOWEVER, HAVE SEEN OR HEARD NOTHING TO SUGGEST </p><p>THAT THE 76 YEAR-OLD PRESIDENT IS SUFFERING FROM </p><p>DEBILITATING HEALTH PROBLEMS OR A DETERIORATION IN MENTAL </p><p>ACUITY (HE DID HAVE SURGERY FOR THROAT PROBLEMS IN 1996 AND </p><p>RECEIVED TREATMENT FOR A URINARY TRACT DISORDER IN 1994). </p><p>HE REMAINS PHYSICALLY ACTIVE, DOING DAILY EARLY MORNING </p><p>SIT-UPS, AND APPEARS AS PHYSICALLY VIGOROUS AND AS MENTALLY </p><p>SHARP AS EVER IN HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCES HERE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04987  080946Z </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
