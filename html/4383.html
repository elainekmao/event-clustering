(C) THE HOLY SEE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF CIVIL </p><p>VIOLENCE IN VENEZUELA IN THE COMING MONTHS, AND THE POPE </p><p>HIMSELF HAS URGED THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS TO "COOL IT" ON </p><p>POLITICAL ACTIVISM AND INSTEAD TO ENCOURAGE DIALOGUE.  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE VIEWED THE BISHOPS\' OCTOBER LETTER ENCOURAGING </p><p>DIALOGUE, READ IN VENEZUELAN CHURCHES, AS A POSITIVE STEP. </p><p>HOLY SEE DIRECTOR OF CARIBBEAN AFFAIRS MSGR. GIORGIO LINGUA </p><p>WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE VENEZUELAN CHURCH WAS FACILITATING </p><p>POLITICAL DIALOGUE IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN BY PROVIDING A VENUE </p><p>FOR TALKS.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HOPES VENEZUELANS WILL </p><p>REFRAIN FROM DANGEROUS STREET PROTESTS AND AN INCONCLUSIVE </p><p>CONSULTATIVE REFERENDUM, AND INSTEAD MAKE FULL USE OF THE </p><p>TIME TO PREPARE FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL RECALL REFERENDUM IN </p><p>AUGUST.  IN LIGHT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR CHAVEZ AMONG THE </p><p>VENEZUELAN POPULATION, LINGUA WAS NOT SANGUINE ABOUT THE </p><p>OPPOSITION\'S CHANCES OF SUCCESS, EVEN IF THEY CONCENTRATE </p><p>FULLY ON ORGANIZING FOR AN AUGUST RECALL REFERENDUM. LINGUA </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CARDINAL ARCHBISHOP VELASCO GARCIA OF </p><p>CARACAS HAD BEEN TOO CLOSE TO THE COUP PLOTTERS LAST APRIL. </p><p>FORMER VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR QUINTANA TOLD AMBASSADOR </p><p>NOVEMBER 18 HE FEARED A VIOLENT DENOUEMENT IN VENEZUELA.

(C)  POLOFFS MET WITH HOLY SEE DIRECTOR FOR CARIBBEAN </p><p>AFFAIRS MSGR. GIORGIO LINGUA NOVEMBER 7 AND AGAIN NOVEMBER 14 </p><p>TO DISCUSS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\'S VIEWS OF THE DEVELOPING </p><p>CIVIL CONFRONTATION IN VENEZUELA.  LINGUA SAID HE WAS WORRIED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05607  01 OF 02  191053Z </p><p>ABOUT THE DETERIORATION OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION, AND </p><p>INDICATED THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD COUNSELED THE VENEZUELAN </p><p>CHURCH TO BACK OFF FROM WHAT HAD BEEN AN OVERLY VISIBLE </p><p>PRESENCE DURING THE APRIL 2002 ATTEMPTED COUP.  LINGUA TOLD </p><p>US THAT WHEN THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS MADE THEIR "AD LIMINA" </p><p>VISIT TO REPORT TO THE POPE IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR (NOTE: THESE </p><p>OCCUR ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE, ROUGHLY EVERY FIVE YEARS), THE </p><p>POPE HAD TOLD THEM TO "COOL IT" ON THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVISM. </p><p>LINGUA, SMILING, THOUGHT THE MESSAGE FROM THE POPE "MIGHT NOT </p><p>HAVE SUNK IN."  HE ADMITTED THAT CARDINAL ARCHBISHOP VELASCO </p><p>GARCIA OF CARACAS WAS PERHAPS TOO CLOSE TO THE COUP PLOTTERS, </p><p>AND DEMONSTRATED POOR JUDGMENT IN PARTICIPATING IN THE </p><p>CARMONA "INAUGURATION CEREMONY." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  THE HOLY SEE WOULD PREFER THAT THE VENEZUELAN CHURCH </p><p>NOT ENGAGE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS DIRECTLY, BUT RATHER SEEK </p><p>TO STIMULATE A PEACEFUL DIALOGUE BETWEEN VENEZUELA\'S </p><p>POLITICAL ELEMENTS.  TO THAT END, THE HOLY SEE, THROUGH ITS </p><p>NUNCIO, HAD WORKED WITH THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE TO </p><p>DRAFT A LETTER READ OCTOBER 20 FROM ALL VENEZUELAN PULPITS. </p><p>LINGUA SHOWED US A SPANISH LANGUAGE TEXT OF THIS LETTER AND </p><p>SAID IT WAS A CONSTRUCTIVE STEP.  THE LETTER MADE AN </p><p>"ANGUISHED APPEAL" TO THE PEOPLE TO OVERCOME THE MOUNTING </p><p>TENSIONS IN THE NATION AND CALLED FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION. </p><p>THE BISHOPS REAFFIRMED "THE IMPERATIVE TO AVOID ALL VIOLENCE, </p><p>WITH ITS FATAL CONSEQUENCES, AND TO TAKE POSITIVE STEPS </p><p>TOWARD UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENTS THAT WILL MAKE </p><p>COEXISTENCE POSSIBLE." AT THE SAME TIME THE LETTER EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT "THERE IS A RIGHT TO GIVE ONE\'S OPINION, TO ASSOCIATE, </p><p>AND TO PROTEST FREELY," AND REMINDED PARISHIONERS THAT IT WAS </p><p>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE PUBLIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05607  01 OF 02  191053Z </p><p>SECURITY AND ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  ASKED ABOUT THE POLITICAL ROAD AHEAD, LINGUA SAID </p><p>THE HOLY SEE HOPES VENEZUELANS WILL REFRAIN FROM DANGEROUS </p><p>STREET PROTESTS AND AN INCONCLUSIVE CONSULTATIVE REFERENDUM, </p><p>AND INSTEAD MAKE FULL USE OF THE TIME TO PREPARE FOR A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL RECALL REFERENDUM IN AUGUST.  POINTING OUT </p><p>THAT CHAVEZ STILL ENJOYS CONSIDERABLE, THOUGH ERODING, </p><p>POPULAR SUPPORT, LINGUA WAS NOT SANGUINE ABOUT THE </p><p>OPPOSITION\'S CHANCES OF SUCCESS, EVEN IF IT CONCENTRATES </p><p>FULLY ON ORGANIZING FOR AN AUGUST RECALL REFERENDUM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>FACILITATING DIALOGUE BUT NO MORE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.

LINGUA </p><p>DOWNPLAYED THE EXTENT OF THE CHURCH\'S ROLE, INDICATING IT HAD </p><p>ONLY PROVIDED A MEETING SPACE AND HAD NOT MEDIATED ANY OF THE </p><p>DISCUSSIONS.  AT ANY RATE, HE SAID, THE MEETING SPACE AT THE </p><p>SEMINARY OUTSIDE OF CARACAS PRESENTED LOGISTICAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05607  02 OF 02  191054Z </p><p>DIFFICULTIES, AND SO THE PARTICIPANTS WOULD NO LONGER MEET </p><p>THERE.  HE EXPRESSED SOME SATISFACTION THAT CHAVEZ HAD AGREED </p><p>TO USE THAT FACILITY, BUT INSISTED THAT CHURCH/GOV RELATIONS </p><p>WERE "NO BETTER AND NO WORSE THAN IN APRIL" (I.E. PRETTY </p><p>BAD).  HE INDICATED THAT CHAVEZ GOONS CONTINUE TO HARASS SOME </p><p>CLERGY, BUT AS YET NONE HAD BEEN PHYSICALLY HARMED.  HAVING </p><p>SAID THAT, HE BACKTRACKED A BIT FROM HIS EARLIER INSISTENCE </p><p>ON A HANDS-OFF ROLE FOR THE CHURCH, AND SAID THE HOLY SEE </p><p>WOULD SUPPORT A FORMAL CHURCH ROLE IN FACILITATING POLITICAL </p><p>DIALOGUE, "ONLY IF BOTH SIDES FORMALLY REQUEST IT." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  WE MENTIONED TO LINGUA POLLING DATA THAT INDICATED A </p><p>MAJORITY OF VENEZUELANS THOUGHT THE CHURCH COULD INDEED PLAY </p><p>A FACILITATING ROLE.  HE WAS SURPRISED, ADMITTING THE HOLY </p><p>SEE BELIEVES IT HAS ALMOST NO SUPPORT AMONG VENEZUELAN POOR. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE SAID THE HOLY SEE WOULD STICK WITH ITS ORIGINAL </p><p>ANALYSIS -- POLITICAL ORGANIZING SHOULD FOCUS ON A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL RECALL REFERENDUM FOR AUGUST NEXT YEAR.  IN </p><p>THE MEANTIME, CHAVEZ\' SUPPORT CONTINUES TO ERODE, AND THE </p><p>MORE HE DEMONSTRATES HE CAN\'T DELIVER, THE MORE HIS </p><p>POPULARITY WILL SLIP.  ASKED WHETHER THE NUNCIO MAINTAINS A </p><p>REGULAR DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION, LINGUA SAID NO MORE </p><p>THAN HE HAS WITH ANY OTHER ELEMENT OF VENEZUELAN SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  AT A LUNCH WITH AMBASSADOR, NOVEMBER 18, FORMER </p><p>VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR (AND FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE) </p><p>IGNACIO QUINTANA EXPRESSED FEARS THAT CONDITIONS WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE IN VENEZUELA.  QUINTANA SAID HE </p><p>THOUGHT THAT CHAVEZ WOULD EVENTUALLY BE TAKEN OUT BY A COUP. </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY WHETHER BLOOD WOULD BE </p><p>SHED, QUINTANA SAID "YES, UNFORTUNATELY." </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05607  02 OF 02  191054Z </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE HOLY SEE FINDS ITSELF IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE </p><p>SITUATION VIS-A-VIS VENEZUELA.  CLEARLY, THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH\'S RELATIONS WITH POPULIST PRESIDENT CHAVEZ ARE POOR </p><p>AND RISK GETTING WORSE.  THE HOLY SEE, WHICH RETAINS VIVID </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL MEMORIES OF LEFTIST SUPPRESSION OF CLERGY IN </p><p>SPAIN AND MEXICO, WOULD NEVER WISH TO SEE RELATIONS </p><p>DETERIORATE TO THE POINT WHERE THE CLERGY AND THE FAITHFUL </p><p>WERE AT RISK OF PHYSICAL HARM.  NONETHELESS, THE HOLY SEE </p><p>WOULD JUST AS CLEARLY PREFER TO SEE CHURCH/STATE RELATIONS IN </p><p>VENEZUELA RETURN TO THE SITUATION THAT EXISTED IN THE </p><p>PRE-CHAVEZ ERA.  LINGUA WAS ACUTELY AWARE OF IRONY OF THE </p><p>CHURCH\'S LACK OF SUPPORT AMONG THE POORER CLASSES IN </p><p>VENEZUELA -- AND OF CHAVEZ\' PUBLIC ACCUSATION LAST JANUARY </p><p>THAT THE CHURCH WAS A "CANCER ON VENEZUELAN SOCIETY" BECAUSE </p><p>OF ITS ASSOCIATION WITH THE "OLIGARCHS."  RECALLING THAT </p><p>CHAVEZ\' OUTBURST WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE PAPAL NUNCIO\'S ANNUAL </p><p>GREETING ON BEHALF OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, LINGUA ONLY </p><p>HALF-JOKINGLY SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT </p><p>REACTIONS WOULD BE TO WHAT THE NUNCIO WOULD SAY THIS COMING </p><p>JANUARY. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  COMMENT CONTINUED:  THE CONTINUED ACTIVISM OF THE </p><p>VENEZUELAN CLERGY IN THE FACE OF THE POPE\'S CAUTION DOES NOT </p><p>SURPRISE US.  EVEN THE POPE HAS LIMITED SWAY OVER WHAT A </p><p>BISHOP DOES IN HIS OWN DIOCESE, UNLESS HIS POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVITIES DIRECTLY THREATEN THE DOCTRINE AND MORALS OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05607  02 OF 02  191054Z </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH OR THE HOLY SEE\'S FOREIGN POLICY.  WE WOULD </p><p>WELCOME EMBASSY CARACAS\'S ASSESSMENT OF HOW RESPONSIVE TO THE </p><p>POPE\'S INSTRUCTIONS THE VENEZUELAN BISHOPS HAVE BEEN.  FROM </p><p>WHERE WE SIT, THEIR OCTOBER 20 LETTER TO PARISHIONERS SEEMS </p><p>AN EFFORT TO MEET THE POPE AT LEAST HALFWAY. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA05607 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
