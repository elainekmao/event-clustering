<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 001018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, CU, CA, UNCHR-1, Cuba </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA-CUBA: FOREIGN MINISTER STRONGLY PROTESTS </p><p>TRIALS OF CUBAN OPPOSITION MEMBERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. OTTAWA 00964 B. STATE 86002 C. OTTAWA 00897 </p><p> </p><p>     D. STATE 75175 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On April 7, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Bill </p><p>Graham called in Cuba\'s ambassador to Canada to formally </p><p>protest the recent arrests and trials of Cuban opposition </p><p>members.  According to Louise Branch, DFAIT\'s Deputy Director </p><p>for Central America and Cuba, who was present at the meeting, </p><p>Minister Graham told Ambassador Fernandez de Cossio Dominguez </p><p>that the prison sentences imposed on opposition members were </p><p>beyond comprehension, and that the government of Cuba was </p><p>making a colossal error. Minister Graham also gave the </p><p>ambassador a letter for Cuban Minister of Foreign Relations </p><p>Felipe Roque in which Graham expressed Canada\'s extreme </p><p>concern about the curtailment of human rights and freedom of </p><p>expression in Cuba. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Branch told poloff on April 8th that Canada\'s </p><p>ambassador in Havana had made an official request to the </p><p>government of Cuba, before the trials began, for a list of </p><p>those arrested, the charges against them, and the rationale </p><p>behind the charges.  The Canadian ambassador also asked that </p><p>a Canadian embassy representative be allowed to attend the </p><p>trials.  The Cuban government refused these requests on the </p><p>basis that the persons on trial were not Canadian citizens, </p><p>and further explained that no diplomatic representatives </p><p>would be allowed to attend the trials. In his letter to the </p><p>Cuban foreign minister, Minister Graham expressed profound </p><p>disappointment in this decision by the Cuban government. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Branch said that Ambassador Dominguez defended his </p><p>government\'s actions during the meeting, asserting that </p><p>opposition members were not arrested for exercising their </p><p>freedom of expression, but because they were </p><p>counter-revolutionaries working with the U.S. The ambassador </p><p>referred to the arrests and trials as a national security </p><p>matter for Cuba.  Minister Graham specifically mentioned a </p><p>prison sentence of 25 years imposed on one of the opposition </p><p>members, saying this was more in line with a sentence for </p><p>murder. According to Branch, the Cuban ambassador responded </p><p>that, no, 30 years was the usual sentence imposed for murder </p><p>in Cuba. Branch said that Ambassador Dominguez complained </p><p>about Principal Officer Cason during the meeting, stating </p><p>that Cason is openly encouraging dissent but Cuba can\'t expel </p><p>him because it would mean the loss of the migratory agreement. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) With reference to the Cuba resolution in the U.N. </p><p>Human Rights Commission (which Canada intends to co-sponsor), </p><p>Branch confirmed that Canada\'s delegation wants tougher </p><p>language, and wants the arrests mentioned specifically. She </p><p>further indicated that Canada has begun promoting the idea of </p><p>a stronger resolution with other UNCHR delegations, </p><p>particularly the Latin American delegations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
