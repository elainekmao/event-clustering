<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000931 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PREL, CH, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT: SETTING VIETNAM\'S IDEOLOGICAL COURSE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  FBIS SEP20020307000012 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY POL/C SCOTT BELLARD, REASON: 1.5 </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY.  THE CPV\'S CENTRAL THEORETICAL </p><p>RESEARCH COUNCIL IS STRUGGLING TO REDEFINE VIETNAMESE </p><p>SOCIALISM IN THE FACE OF MARKET-DRIVEN ECONOMIC </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBALIZATION, AS WELL AS INTERNAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00931  01 OF 03  160954Z </p><p>CHALLENGES STEMMING FROM OVERLY BUREAUCRATIC PRACTICES </p><p>AND CORRUPTION.  ENTRY INTO THE CPV OF PRIVATE </p><p>ENTREPRENEURS REMAINS A CONTENTIOUS THEORETICAL ISSUE. </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL ORGANS ARE LIKELY DESPERATE TO RETAIN </p><p>INFLUENCE IN AN ERA WHEN THEORIES ARE OF LITTLE IF ANY </p><p>INTEREST TO MOST OF THE PUBLIC AND WHEN THE IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE CPV IS INCREASINGLY IRRELEVANT TO </p><p>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REALITIES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  IN A MEETING WITH POL/C ON APRIL 15, DR. DAO </p><p>DUY QUAT, VICE CHAIRMAN OF COMMISSION FOR IDEOLOGICAL </p><p>AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) AND SIMULTANEOUSLY A </p><p>MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL THEORETICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, </p><p>DESCRIBED THE MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND PRIORITIES OF THE </p><p>COUNCIL.  HE WAS JOINED BY DR. NGUYEN VIET THONG, </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE THEORETICAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OF THE </p><p>COMMISSION FOR IDEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS, AND </p><p>MS. PHAM THI DAO, AN EXPERT IN ITS DEPARTMENT FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND POPULARIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) DR. QUAT STRESSED THAT ALL THE WORK OF THE </p><p>COUNCIL WAS PREMISED ON THE NECESSITY FOR THE CPV TO </p><p>"HOLD POWER" AND TO RETAIN ITS "DECISIVE PATH-SETTING" </p><p>VIS-A-VIS POLICIES FOR VIETNAM.  THE COUNCIL ACTS AS AN </p><p>"ADVISER" TO THE POLITBURO, CENTRAL COMMITTEE, AND CPV </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH ON THE THEORETICAL </p><p>BASIS FOR EXISTING AND NEW POLICIES, ALTHOUGH HE SAID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00931  01 OF 03  160954Z </p><p>THAT THE COUNCIL MEMBERS DO NOT OFFER SPECIFIC POLICY </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS PER SE.  THE COUNCIL ALSO ADVISES THE </p><p>CPV ON IDEOLOGICAL CAMPAIGNS TO IMPLEMENT CPV </p><p>DECISIONS, SUCH AS TO PROMOTE VIETNAM\'S ECONOMIC </p><p>MODERNIZATION UNDER "DOI MOI" AND ITS INTEGRATION INTO </p><p>THE WORLD ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE SELECTED FOR FIVE YEAR </p><p>TERMS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH NEW PARTY CONGRESS.  DR. </p><p>QUAT WAS ELECTED TO HIS SECOND TERM AT THE NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS IN 2001, WHEN THE COUNCIL WAS EXPANDED FROM 23 </p><p>TO 36 MEMBERS.  THE COUNCIL DID NOT EXIST UNDER THIS </p><p>NAME OR WITH ITS CURRENT FUNCTIONS BEFORE THE 7TH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS, ALTHOUGH DR. QUAT INDICATED THAT OTHER CPV </p><p>ORGANS BEFORE THEN HAD HANDLED RELATED FUNCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE COUNCIL INCLUDES FIVE OFFICES:  POLITICS, </p><p>ECONOMICS, CULTURE AND SOCIETY, PARTY-BUILDING, AND </p><p>DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY.  (NOTE:  EMBASSY </p><p>UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE ALSO FIVE PERMANENT STAFF </p><p>MEMBERS, ALTHOUGH DR. QUAT DID NOT DISCUSS THEIR </p><p>EXISTENCE OR ROLE. END NOTE)  EACH MEMBER IS FOCUSED ON </p><p>ONE MAIN SPECIALTY, WHILE EXPECTED ALSO TO BE ABLE TO </p><p>CONTRIBUTE ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE COUNCIL\'S WORK. </p><p>COUNCIL MEMBERS MAY INDIVIDUALLY OR JOINTLY UNDERTAKE </p><p>"RESEARCH" PROJECTS, WHICH APPEAR MOSTLY TO TAKE THE </p><p>FORM OF VISITS AND INSPECTIONS (BOTH TO CENTRAL ORGANS </p><p>IN HANOI AND IN THE COUNTRYSIDE), AS WELL AS LIAISON </p><p>AND EXCHANGES OF VIEWS WITH FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS.  DR. </p><p>QUAT EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN CONTACTS WITH A RESEARCH </p><p>ORGANIZATION UNDER THE "RULING PARTY" OF THE UNITED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00931  01 OF 03  160954Z </p><p>STATES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  THE COUNCIL MEETS IN PLENUM FOR ABOUT A WEEK </p><p>EVERY THREE MONTHS, DR. QUAT SAID, FOR GENERAL </p><p>DISCUSSION ON TWO OR THREE SELECTED THEORETICAL ISSUES. </p><p>IT USUALLY PREPARES A WRITTEN DOCUMENT FOR REFERENCE </p><p>PRIMARILY BY THE POLITBURO AND GENERAL SECRETARY; HE </p><p>ADMITTED THAT THESE DOCUMENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR </p><p>PUBLIC PURVIEW OR DISCUSSION.  THE POLITBURO ISSUES </p><p>GENERAL GUIDANCE ON THEORETICAL PRIORITIES AT THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF EVERY PARTY CONGRESS, BUT HE ADDED THAT </p><p>THE COUNCIL RECEIVES MORE UPDATED GUIDANCE REGULARLY AS </p><p>PRIORITIES CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>TASKS FOR 2002 </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE COUNCIL CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE TO </p><p>ARTICULATE A "CLEAR THEORY" ABOUT THE NATURE AND </p><p>DIRECTION OF SOCIALISM IN A MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMY, </p><p>DR. QUAT ADMITTED.  HE NOTED THE THEORETICAL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9929 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00931  02 OF 03  160955Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------86CD26  160955Z /38 </p><p>R 160912Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6195 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HANOI 000931 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DIFFICULTIES IN DEFINING THE LEADING ROLE OF THE PARTY </p><p>IN AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INCREASINGLY DRIVEN BY THE </p><p>ROLE OF MARKETS.  HE POINTED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>THE US-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT, AS WELL AS TO </p><p>THE EFFECTS OF GLOBALIZATION ON VIETNAMESE AGRICULTURE, </p><p>AS OTHER COMPLICATING FACTORS IN THIS THEORETICAL </p><p>DEBATE.  HOWEVER, HE STRESSED THAT THE SIGNING AND </p><p>RATIFICATION OF THE BTA, AS WELL AS ONGOING EFFORTS BY </p><p>VIETNAM TO JOIN THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, CLEARLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00931  02 OF 03  160955Z </p><p>WERE THE RESULTS OF, AND REFLECTED, CPV POLICY AND </p><p>PRIORITIES.  HE ALSO POINTED TO THE "LONG TERM POSITIVE </p><p>EFFECTS" OF BTA ON VIETNAM\'S ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND SAID </p><p>THAT ITS IMPLEMENTATION WAS UNDOUBTEDLY IN THE BEST </p><p>INTERESTS OF BOTH COUNTRIES.  HE NOTED EXPLICITLY THAT </p><p>HE WAS "NOT OFFERING PERSONAL OPINIONS." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  STRENGTHENING THE IDEOLOGICAL LEVEL OF PARTY </p><p>AND GOVERNMENT CADRES WAS ANOTHER KEY TASK FOR 2002, </p><p>DR. QUAT SAID.  HE NOTED THAT "THE REALITY IS THAT SOME </p><p>PARTY MEMBERS AND SOME CADRES ARE WEAK" IN THIS DOMAIN. </p><p>HE CLAIMED NONETHELESS THAT THE PARTY WAS "MAKING </p><p>PROGRESS" IN THIS EFFORT.  (REFTEL PROVIDES TEXT OF CPV </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY MANH\'S SPEECH TO A JANUARY 29 MEETING </p><p>OF THE COUNCIL, AS REPORTED IN TAP CHI CONG SAN, THE </p><p>BIMONTHLY THEORETICAL JOURNAL OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, </p><p>IN WHICH HE DISCUSSES THIS PROBLEM EXTENSIVELY.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  ANOTHER ONGOING DEBATE REVOLVED AROUND PARTY </p><p>MEMBERSHIP BY PRIVATE ENTREPRENEURS, DR. QUAT SAID IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO A QUESTION.  HE NOTED THAT THE COUNCIL HAD </p><p>FOLLOWED CLOSELY THE DEBATE WITHIN THE CHINESE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY ON THIS ISSUE, BUT THAT THE CCP WAS </p><p>FURTHER AHEAD IN ITS DECISION-MAKING.  (HE ADDED THAT </p><p>HE WAS LEAVING ON APRIL 16 FOR THE PRC TO EXCHANGE </p><p>VIEWS ON THIS AND OTHER THEORETICAL ISSUES WITH CCP </p><p>COUNTERPARTS.)  DR. QUAT REMARKED THAT THE "BIG </p><p>DISAGREEMENTS" WITHIN THE CPV ON THIS SUBJECT STEMMED </p><p>FROM THE CPV\'S SELF-IDENTIFICATION WITH THE "WORKERS" </p><p>AND NOT WITH THE "BOSSES" OR "EXPLOITERS."  MANY CPV </p><p>MEMBERS, OR AT LEAST "A PART" OF THE CPV, FELT STRONGLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00931  02 OF 03  160955Z </p><p>THAT THE CPV SHOULD MAINTAIN THIS SOLIDARITY.  HOWEVER, </p><p>THE CPV LEADERSHIP HAS ALREADY AGREED THAT CURRENT CPV </p><p>MEMBERS MAY ENGAGE IN PRIVATE BUSINESS, ACCORDING TO </p><p>DR. QUAT, WHILE DEFERRING FOR NOW ANY DECISION ON </p><p>WHETHER ANY NEW MEMBERS MAY COME FROM THE RANKS OF </p><p>PRIVATE BUSINESS OR ENTERPRISE.  HE PREDICTED FINAL </p><p>RESOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE BEFORE THE 10TH PARTY CONGRESS </p><p>IN 2006. </p><p> </p><p>CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTURE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  DR. QUAT SAID THAT ESSENTIAL TO THE CPV\'S </p><p>FUTURE WOULD BE THE CPV\'S AND GVN\'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AT SUITABLE LEVELS.  THE COUNCIL </p><p>IS SEEKING TO FRAME THE THEORETICAL UNDERPINNINGS UNDER </p><p>MARXIST-LENINIST THOUGHT FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF AN </p><p>INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY BY 2020 UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE </p><p>CPV, HE ADDED.  THE OTHER MAIN CHALLENGE OVER THE NEXT </p><p>FEW YEARS WILL BE THE CPV\'S ABILITY SUCCESSFULLY TO </p><p>COMBAT "BUREAUCRATICISM AND CORRUPTION."  WHILE </p><p>STRESSING THAT ALL SOCIETIES AND SYSTEMS FACE SUCH </p><p>PROBLEMS, HE ADMITTED THAT IF THE CPV FAILS AT THIS </p><p>TASK -- OR IS PERCEIVED AS FAILING -- IT WOULD BE "VERY </p><p>DANGEROUS" FOR THE CPV\'S MONOPOLY ON POWER.  WHEN ASKED </p><p>IF HE WAS "OPTIMISTIC" THAT THE CPV WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL </p><p>IN THIS FIGHT, HE RESPONDED ONLY THAT "WE BELIEVE WE </p><p>CAN SOLVE" THESE PROBLEMS.  HE POINTED TO RECENT </p><p>REQUIREMENTS ON THE DECLARATION OF ASSETS BY OFFICIALS </p><p>AS EVIDENCE OF THE CPV\'S DETERMINATION, WHILE ADMITTING </p><p>THAT CULTURAL PRACTICES AND LACK OF ADEQUATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00931  02 OF 03  160955Z </p><p>SUPERVISION MADE IT DIFFICULT TO ENSURE FULL </p><p>DISCLOSURE.  DR. QUAT ALSO CLAIMED THAT </p><p>"DEMOCRATIZATION" WOULD PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THIS </p><p>STRUGGLE, AND THAT A LARGER ROLE FOR THE MEDIA IN </p><p>INVESTIGATING SUCH PROBLEMS COULD BE VALUABLE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  COMMENT:  THE CPV\'S IDEOLOGICAL ORGANS </p><p>PROBABLY REMAIN AMONG THE LAST BASTIONS OF COMMUNIST </p><p>CONSERVATISM, ALONG WITH ELEMENTS OF THE DEFENSE AND </p><p>SECURITY HIERARCHY.  AS SUCH, THEY LIKELY ARE </p><p>STRUGGLING TO RETAIN THEIR IDENTITY AND A USEFUL ROLE </p><p>IN THIS RAPIDLY CHANGING SOCIETY, IN WHICH THE </p><p>DIRECTIVES AND THEORETICAL DEBATES OF THE CPV ARE, OR </p><p>MAY APPEAR TO BE, OF INCREASINGLY IRRELEVANCE TO THE </p><p>LIVES OF MOST VIETNAMESE CITIZENS.  WITH MARKET FORCES </p><p>REPLACING CPV DIKTATS AS THE BASIS FOR ECONOMIC </p><p>DECISIONS, THE LEADERSHIP ROLE OF THE CPV IS </p><p>NECESSARILY CIRCUMSCRIBED, EVEN THOUGH THE CPV, </p><p>DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE GVN, RETAINS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>COERCIVE AND/OR PUNITIVE CAPACITIES.  FOR ALL THE </p><p>PUBLICITY IN THE MEDIA GIVEN TO THE "THREATS" FROM </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9931 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00931  03 OF 03  160955Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  DS-00    FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------86CD2B  160955Z /38 </p><p>R 160912Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6196 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HANOI 000931 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>"HOSTILE FORCES" OR FROM "PEACEFUL EVOLUTION," IT IS </p><p>NOTABLE THAT DR. QUAT DID NOT CITE SUCH ISSUES AS </p><p>PRIORITY TASKS FOR 2002 OR FUTURE CHALLENGES FOR THE </p><p>CPV.  THIS MAY INDICATE THAT EVEN THE CPV DOES NOT TAKE </p><p>ITS OWN PROPAGANDA TOTALLY SERIOUSLY (OR THAT ITS </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL LEADERS SEE NO POINT IN DISCUSSING DIRECTLY </p><p>WITH A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE USG). </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00931  03 OF 03  160955Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
