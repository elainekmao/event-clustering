<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BEIRUT 003820 </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR LEAF </p><p>NICOSIA FOR ERDMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 10/01/08 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINR, PREL, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  LEBANESE PARLIAMENT ELECTS ARMY COMMANDER EMILE </p><p>          LAHUD AS PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  A) STATE 190962  B) DAMASCUS 6387 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR DAVID M. SATTERFIELD. </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY:  RATIFYING THE NAME WHICH EMERGED FROM LAST </p><p>WEEK\'S SUMMIT BETWEEN LEBANESE PRESIDENT HRAWI AND SYRIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT ASAD, THE LEBANESE PARLIAMENT TODAY ELECTED LAF </p><p>COMMANDER EMILE LAHUD AS LEBANON\'S ELEVENTH PRESIDENT BY A </p><p>QUASI-UNANIMOUS VOTE OF 118 (AND 10 ABSTENTIONS).  WHILE </p><p>UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES NO PRESIDENT COULD BE CHOSEN </p><p>WITHOUT DAMASCUS\' BLESSING, LAHUD APPEARS TO BE A GENUINE </p><p>NATIONAL CONSENSUS CANDIDATE -- WITH MOST LEBANESE TAKING </p><p>HOPE FROM LAHUD\'S REPUTATION AS THE CORRUPTION-FREE </p><p>REBUILDER OF A DECONFESSIONALIZED NATIONAL ARMY AND ABOVE </p><p>ALL, A LEADER FROM OUTSIDE THE LARGELY DISCREDITED POLITICAL </p><p>CLASS.  WITH MONTHS OF FEVERED SPECULATION OVER THE IDENTITY </p><p>OF THEIR NEXT PRESIDENT NOW ENDED, AN EQUALLY INTENSE FOCUS </p><p>WILL NOW TURN ON LAHUD\'S POLITICAL PROGRAM AND THE </p><p>COMPOSITION OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT.  LAHUD AND HIS SOON-TO- </p><p>BE COLLEAGUES IN THE TRIPARTITE PRESIDENCY, PM HARIRI AND </p><p>SPEAKER BERRI, WILL UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE THEIR OWN IDEAS ABOUT </p><p>THE NEW GOVERNMENT SHOULD RUN -- AS WILL DAMASCUS. </p><p>EXPECTATIONS OF POSITIVE CHANGE ARE RUNNING HIGH HERE, AS IS </p><p>SKEPTICISM OVER WHETHER ANY OF THE PARTIES CONCERNED TRULY </p><p>WANT TO SEE SUCH CHANGE TAKE PLACE.  OUR CONTINUED PUBLIC </p><p>AND PRIVATE EMPHASIS ON STRENGTHENING LEBANON\'S INSTITUTIONS </p><p>AND GOOD GOVERNANCE WILL BE IMPORTANT, BUT WHETHER LEBANESE </p><p>(AND OUR OWN) HOPES WILL BE FULFILLED REMAINS VERY MUCH TO </p><p>BE SEEN.    END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT: WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY (IN </p><p>DAMASCUS) MAKES </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  MONTHS OF INTENSE SPECULATION AMONG LEBANON\'S </p><p>POLITICAL ELITES REGARDING THE IDENTITY OF THE NEXT </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC WERE ENDED WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT </p><p>LATE ON OCTOBER 5 -- FOLLOWING PRESIDENT HRAWI\'S SUMMIT WITH </p><p>SYRIAN PRESIOENT ASAD -- THAT ARTICLE 49 OF THE LEBANESE </p><p>CONSTITUTION WAS TO BE AMENDED TO PERMIT SENIOR GOVERNMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS (LAF COMMANDING GENERAL EMILE LAHUD, FOR EXAMPLE) </p><p>TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT.  WHILE HRAWI CERTAINLY WAS SEEKING </p><p>ASAD\'S APPROVAL FOR AN AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE 49, IN HIS CASE </p><p>TO PERMIT ANOTHER EXTENSION IN OFFICE, THE GENERAL CAME AWAY </p><p>THE WINNER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: ARTICLE 49 WAS ADDED AT THE TIME OF THE </p><p>TAIF ACCORD TO PRECLUDE THE POSSIBLE CANDIDACY OF THEN </p><p>(REBEL)  LAF COMMANDER LTG MICHEL AOUN.  IRONICALLY, TODAY\'S </p><p>VOTE  COINCIDED WITH THE ANNIVERSARY OF AOUN\'S FORCED </p><p>DEPARTURE FROM LEBANON\'S PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AT THE HANDS OF </p><p>THE SYRIAN MILITARY AND THEIR LEBANESE ALLIES (EN ROUTE TO </p><p>ULTIMATE EXILE IN FRANCE) ON 13 OCTOBER 199O.  AOUN TOLD THE </p><p>PRESS IN PARIS THAT HE IS PREPARED TO RETURN TO LEBANON </p><p>SHOULD LAHUD MAKE THE REQUEST -- AN UNLIKELY SCENARIO.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) ACTING IN RECORD TIME AND WITH A VIGOR USUALLY </p><p>UNKNOWN HERE, PRESIDENT HRAWI AND THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS </p><p>PROMPTLY SENT TO THE PARLIAMENT THE REQUISITE AMENDMENT OF </p><p>ARTICLE 49 WHICH WOULD PERMIT "FOR ONE TIME ONLY" AND ON AN </p><p>EXCEPTIONAL BASIS THE CANDIDACY OF A SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT. </p><p>MP BOUTROS HARB, A MEMBER OF THE JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE OF PARLIAMENT AND A DECLARED PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATE, VOTED AGAINST THE AMENDMENT IN COMMITTEE.  LEGAL </p><p>ANALYSTS, INCLUDING A MEMBER OF LEBANON\'S CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>COUNCIL, TOLD EMBOFFS THAT THE DEBATE CENTERED ON WHETHER </p><p>THE ONE-TIME EXCEPTION CLAUSE PROPOSED BY HRAWI WAS </p><p>SUFFICIENT TO NULLIFY THE REQUIREMENT, EMBODIED IN LEBANESE </p><p>ELECTORAL LAW, THAT THE CANDIDATE MUST HAVE BEEN OUT OF </p><p>ACTIVE MILITARY DUTY FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS.  SINCE THE </p><p>AMENDMENT WAS NOT SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>COUNCIL, THE POINT BECAME MOOT (ASSUMING THAT, UNDER THE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, CONSTITUTIONAL SUBSTANCE AS OPPOSED TO FORM </p><p>WAS EVER AT ISSUE) WHEN THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE APPROVED </p><p>IT ON 12 OCTOBER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) ON 14 OCTOBER THE FULL PARLIAMENT PASSED THE </p><p>AMENDMENT BY A VOTE OF 113 TO 4 AGAINST (WITH 11 ABSTENTIONS </p><p>-- COMPRISED MOSTLY OF DRUZE LEADER WALID JUMBLATT\'S </p><p>PROGRESSIVE SOCIALIST PARTY AND ITS ALLIES).  FORMER PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, MP OMAR KARAME, CONTINUED HIS TWO-YEAR BOYCOTT OF </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY SESSIONS AND REFUSED TO ATTEND THE SESSION </p><p>DESPITE HIS PERSONAL SUPPORT FOR GENERAL LAHUD.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THE HASTY AMENDMENT PROCESS DID HAVE ONE POSITIVE OUTCOME: </p><p>IT BROUGHT PM HARIRI AND SPEAKER BERRI TO TALK WITH EACH </p><p>OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY MONTHS.  THE UNVEILING OF A </p><p>STATUE OF LEBANON\'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER AND INDEPENDENCE </p><p>HERO, RIYAD SOLH, ON 14 OCTOBER, ALSO PROVIDED AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TWO POLITICAL FOES TO COME TOGETHER, </p><p>THIS TIME TO BASH THE TURKS (RECALLING OTTOMAN HEGEMONY AND </p><p>OPPRESSION OF LEBANESE PATRIOTS SUCH AS AL-SOLH).  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) MP NASSIB LAHUD, AN UNDECLARED CONTENDER FOR THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY, ARGUED FOR SIMPLY ABOLISHING THE PROBLEMATIC </p><p>CLAUSES OF ARTICLE 49 RATHER THAN ADD A "ONE-TIME ONLY" </p><p>PROVISION WHICH IN HIS VIEW WEAKENED THE CONSTITUTION.  "BY </p><p>AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION FOR ONE TIME ONLY AND </p><p>EXCEPTIONALLY ON THE EVE OF EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, IS </p><p>A STATE OF LAW AND INSTITUTIONS BEING BUILT?" HE TOLD THE </p><p>PRESS (A SENTIMENT OTHER POLITICIANS AND ANALYSTS HERE HAVE </p><p>EXPRESSED TO US PRIVATELY.)  HOWEVER, LAHUD, ESTRANGED </p><p>COUSIN OF EMILE, SUBSEQUENTLY INDICATED HIS INTENTION TO </p><p>VOTE FOR THE GENERAL. </p><p> </p><p>ELECTION DAY ATMOSPHERICS:  A GOOD TIME HAD BY ALL </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS WERE SUMMONED TO ATTEND THE </p><p>ELECTORAL SESSION OF PARLIAMENT AT 110O ON 15 OCTOBER.  WITH </p><p>ALL BUT TEN (MOSTLY ALLIES OF DRUZE LEADER AND MINISTER OF </p><p>DISPLACED WALID JUMBLATT) OF THE 128 DEPUTIES IN THEIR </p><p>SEATS, SPEAKER NABIH BERRI MADE THIS TRAIN RUN ON TIME.  A </p><p>SHOUT OF "WHY CAN\'T WE JUST DECLARE THIS THING DONE" WAS MET </p><p>BY MIXED LAUGHTER AND CRIES OF "GIVES US THE BALLOTS." </p><p>AFTER COLLECTION OF THE SEALED UNMARKED ENVELOPES CONTAINING </p><p>THE MPS\' CHOICE, DEPUTY SPEAKER FERZLI OPENED EACH AND READ </p><p>ALOUD (118 TIMES) THE NAME "EMILE LAHUD."  THIS PROCESS </p><p>ELICITED STILL MORE GALES OF LAUGHTER AND BANTERING ON THE </p><p>FLOOR, WITH BERRI AT ONE POINT ORDERING FERZLI TO "SPEED IT </p><p>UP."  AT 11:25, EMILE LAHUD WAS DECLARED THE PRESIDENT- </p><p>ELECT.  AS THE DIPLOMATS AND DEPUTIES DECAMPED, FRENCH </p><p>AMBASSADOR JOUANNEAU SUMMED UP THE PROCEEDINGS FOR THOSE </p><p>PRESENT BY DRYLY NOTING "QUELLE SURPRISE." </p><p> </p><p>HOPES FOR LAHUD </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  WHILE MOST LEBANESE RESENT SYRIAN DIRECTION OF THE </p><p>ELECTORAL PROCESS AND THE HASTY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, </p><p>THERE IS NEAR (AND TO US GENUINE) CONSENSUS SUPPORT FOR </p><p>GENERAL LAHUD AS LEBANON\'S NEXT PRESIDENT -- AND AS A </p><p>CATALYST FOR MUCH-NEEDED CHANGE.  THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AND </p><p>CAVEATS IN THIS SUPPORT, HOWEVER.  JUMBLATT AND HIS DRUZE </p><p>ALLIES REMAIN DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE MILITARY AND HIS </p><p>RELATIONS WITH LAHUD CAN BE EXPECTED TO BE (AT BEST) </p><p>PROBLEMATIC.  WHILE MOST MARONITES SEE LAHUD AS AMONG THE </p><p>BEST OF THE POSSIBLE CANDIDATES (THEIR HEARTS WERE WITH </p><p>NASSIB LAHUD OR BUTROS HARB) AND FAR SUPERIOR TO THE LIKES </p><p>OF JEAN OBEYD OR ELIE HOBEIQA, THERE IS A RESERVOIR OF </p><p>CONCERN THAT SYRIA WILL NOW DICTATE THE CHOICE OF LAHUD\'S </p><p>SUCCESSOR IN THE LAF AND WILL THUS HAVE BOTH THE PRESIDENT </p><p>AND ARMY CHIEF BEHOLDEN TO THEIR WILL. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) ALTHOUGH FORMER PRESIDENT CHARLES HELOU TOLD THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR ON 14 OCTOBER THAT HE VIEWED A LAHUD PRESIDENCY </p><p>WITH GREAT OPTIMISM, MANY FROM HIS POLITICAL GENERATION </p><p>RECALL THE REIGN OF PRESIDENT FOUAD SHEHAB (ALSO LAF </p><p>COMMANDER BEFORE HIS ELECTION) WHOSE USE OF THE LAF G-2 TO </p><p>MONITOR AND SHAPE POLITICAL DECISIONS WAS WIDELY RESENTED </p><p>AND FEARED.   DESPITE SUCH RESERVATIONS, FROM HIZBALLAH TO </p><p>THE MARONITE LEAGUE, LAHUD HAS A WIDE BODY OF SUPPORT ACROSS </p><p>CONFESSIONAL LINES AND AMONG THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  KEY </p><p>LEADERS IN THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT, NOTABLY PM HARIRI, HAVE </p><p>BEEN QUICK TO PLEDGE PUBLICLY THEIR DESIRE TO COOPERATE WITH </p><p>THE NEW PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>ITS THE ECONOMY, STUPID (AND THE SOCIETY, AND POLITICS) </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE UNANSWERED QUESTION HERE IS WHAT, PRECISELY, </p><p>THE NEW PRESIDENT INTENDS TO DO WITH THIS SUPPORT.  LEBANON </p><p>FACES A VARIETY OF SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES:  THE NEED FOR </p><p>URGENT ECONOMIC REFORMS, AN ALMOST WHOLLY DISCREDITED AND </p><p>CORRUPT SPOILS SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND CONTINUING DRIFT IN </p><p>SEARCH OF A NEW, POST-CIVIL WAR IDENTITY AND SENSE OF </p><p>NATIONHOOD.  NOT ONE OF LEBANON\'S MANY POLITICIANS, </p><p>ECONOMISTS OR JOURNALISTS CLAIM TO KNOW WHAT IS IN LAHUD\'S </p><p>MIND OR WHETHER, IN FACT, HE HAS A PROGRAM FOR GOVERNANCE. </p><p>THE ROLE AND AUTHORITY OF THE POST-TAIF PRESIDENT IS ITSELF </p><p>AMBIGUOUS.  UNLIKE THE PRIME MINISTER AND SPEAKER OF THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT, WHO HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED EXECUTIVE AND </p><p>LEGISLATIVE POWERS AND PREROGATIVES, THE PRESIDENT -- BY THE </p><p>TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION -- PLAYS A LARGELY SYMBOLIC ROLE. </p><p>PERSONAL CORRUPTION, LACK OF INTEREST AND LIMITED </p><p>CREDIBILITY AS A NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL STATESMAN </p><p>RENDERED CURRENT PRESIDENT HRAWI UNFIT OR UNABLE TO TAKE ON </p><p>ANY LARGER, MORE EFFECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES.  MANY HERE </p><p>ARGUE THAT LAHUD CAN INDEED ASSUME A SIGNIFICANT ROLE AS AN </p><p>EXEMPLAR OF PERSONAL ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT AND, BUILDING ON </p><p>HIS SUCCESS WITH THE LAF, IN REBUILDING AND REINFORCING THE </p><p>INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) ASSUMING THAT LAHUD DOES HAVE A CONCEPT OF WHAT HE </p><p>WISHES TO DO AS PRESIDENT (THERE ARE SOME WHO ASSERT THAT </p><p>LAHUD WANTS VERY MUCH TO BE PRESIDENT, BUT DOES NOT HAVE A </p><p>CLEAR VISION OF WHAT HE WILL DO ONCE THERE), HE WILL FACE A </p><p>FORMIDABLE CHALLENGE IN THE PERSON OF PM HARIRI -- WHO IS </p><p>VIRTUALLY CERTAIN TO CONTINUE AS PRIME MINISTER -- TO ANY </p><p>ATTEMPT TO ACT IN A MANNER WHICH HARIRI WILL VIEW AS </p><p>THREATENING HIS OWN PREEMINENCE.  FOR ALL HARIRI\'S TALK OF </p><p>SUPPORT FOR LAHUD AS "A STRONG PRESIDENT," THE CLEAR SUBTEXT </p><p>IS "STRONG PRESIDENT, YES" BUT AS AN ASSET FOR HARIRI\'S USE </p><p>TO COUNTER SPEAKER BERRI.  THE PM TOLD AMBASSADOR SHORTLY </p><p>BEFORE THE ELECTION THAT "I HOPE LAHUD WILL BE AN ALLY.  BUT </p><p>IF HE THINKS HE CAN DICTATE TO ME ON HOW A NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p>WILL BE FORMED OR TRIES TO BLOCK ME, I WILL CRUSH HIM." </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) FOR HIS PART, BERRI WANTS A NEW GOVERNMENT COMPOSED </p><p>OF PARLIAMENTARIANS.  FORMER SPEAKER HUSSEIN HUSSEINI -- NO </p><p>FRIEND OF BERRI BUT LOYAL TO THE PARLIAMENT AND ITS ROLE -- </p><p>TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON 14 OCTOBER THAT HE, TOO, FAVORED A </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF DEPUTIES REPRESENTING ALL CONFESSIONS "IN THE </p><p>SPIRIT OF TAIF."  THIS IS IN CONTRAST, HUSSEINI SAID, TO THE </p><p>KNOWN INTENT OF THE PRIME MINISTER TO CREATE A CABINET OF </p><p>"TECHNOCRATS." </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA:  WHAT DOES ASAD WANT? </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) EMBASSY DAMASCUS\' EXCELLENT DISCUSSION (REFTEL) OF </p><p>THE VARYING INTERPRETATIONS POSSIBLE FOR SELECTION OF LAHUD </p><p>MATCHES OUR OWN (AND OUR INTERLOCUTORS) UNCERTAINTY WHETHER </p><p>DAMASCUS SEES IN LAHUD A STABILIZING FORCE IN THE BEST SENSE </p><p>(STRENGTHENED POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION) OR THE WORST </p><p>(LAHUD AS YET ANOTHER PLAYER TO BE MANIPULATED IN ORDER TO </p><p>PREVENT EMERGENCE OF ANY INDEPENDENT AND THUS THREATENING -- </p><p>TO SYRIA -- LEBANESE POLITY).  THOSE WHO BELIEVE THE LATTER, </p><p>E.G. MINISTER HOBEIQA, STATE FLATLY THAT THE SYRIANS WILL </p><p>CONTROL THE OVERALL PROCESS OF FORMING A NEW GOVERNMENT -- </p><p>WHICH WILL MERELY BE A "RESHUFFLING" OF THE MINISTERIAL </p><p>DOSSIERS RATHER THAN ANY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN APPROACH TO </p><p>GOVERNANCE IN LEBANON.  HOBEIQA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON 9 </p><p>OCTOBER THAT HE RECOGNIZED THAT "THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN </p><p>SYRIA," BUT BELIEVED THAT IS PRECISELY WHY THE SYRIANS WANT </p><p>A PRESIDENT LIKE LAHUD WHO HAS PROVEN HIMSELF PREDICTABLE, </p><p>AND RELIABLE AS AN ALLY TO ASAD\'S SON BASHAR IN DAYS TO </p><p>COME.  HOBEIQA (SPEAKING HERE FOR A WIDE SPECTRUM OF </p><p>LEBANON\'S POLITICAL CLASS) DID NOT THINK LAHUD HAD THE </p><p>EXPERIENCE NEED TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE.  "WHO MAKES CHANGE </p><p>HERE?," HOBEIQA ASKED SARCASTICALLY.  "I HOPE THE GENERAL IS </p><p>A GOOD TACTICIAN.  I AM SURE HE IS NOT.  PEOPLE SAY HE IS A </p><p>GOOD GENERAL.  WHAT DOES IT MEAN?  HE NEVER HAD TO FIGHT, </p><p>AND HE WILL FACE TESTS AHEAD." </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C) MOST LEBANESE HOPE LAHUD\'S LEADERSHIP WILL MARK AN </p><p>END TO THE SQUABBLING, INEFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT OF THE </p><p>"TROIKA" (I.E., THE PRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTER, AND SPEAKER). </p><p>INDEED, REPORTS ARE CIRCULATING HERE THAT THE SYRIANS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY ASAD HIMSELF, DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE RECEIVING </p><p>STREAMS OF LEBANESE VISITORS PLEADING THEIR CASES AND </p><p>PROBLEMS IN DAMASCUS.  LAHUD MAY WELL PUT AN END TO SOME OF </p><p>THIS ACTIVITY (JUST AS HE FORBADE JUNIOR OFFICERS TO HAVE </p><p>CONTACT WITH THE SYRIANS OUTSIDE OF LEBANON).  BUT HERE </p><p>AGAIN, THERE IS A DARKER READING OF SYRIAN INTENTIONS FROM </p><p>SOME OF LEBANON\'S MOST ASTUTE ANALYSTS, INCLUDING </p><p>EDITORIALIST SARKIS NAOUM AND FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER FOUAD </p><p>BUTROS.  THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT BEYOND HIS PROVEN RECORD AS </p><p>A DEPENDABLE PARTNER TO SYRIA AND AN ASSET FOR THE FUTURE, </p><p>SYRIA CHOSE LAHUD BECAUSE HE REPRESENTED THE MOST POTENT </p><p>COUNTERWEIGHT THAT COULD BE POSED AGAINST HARIRI -- WHOSE </p><p>PERCEIVED INDEPENDENCE NEEDED A MORE EFFECTIVE BALANCE THAN </p><p>HRAWI COULD PROVIDE.  THEY ASSERT "LAHUD IS SEEN BY THE </p><p>SYRIANS AS AN ANTI-HARIRI." </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C) COMMENT:  WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR US?  LAHUD </p><p>REMAINS A POLITICAL ENIGMA AND SYRIAN INTENTIONS IN </p><p>PERMITTING HIS ELECTION -- ALBEIT TO POPULAR ACCLAIM -- ARE </p><p>EVEN HARDER TO READ.  MUCH OF THE SKEPTICISM PREVALENT HERE </p><p>IS WORTH TAKING ON BOARD, BUT LAHUD WILL STILL HAVE SOME </p><p>TIME TO NAME A NEW GOVERNMENT AND ELABORATE HIS PROGRAM. </p><p>WHETHER THIS WILL AMOUNT TO THE FORMATION OF A "THIRD </p><p>REPUBLIC" CHARACTERIZED BY MORE EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>LESS VENAL POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, OR MORE OF THE SAME SORT OF </p><p>TURF BATTLES BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE TROIKA REMAINS TO BE </p><p>SEEN.  WE CLEARLY HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE FORMER.  THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT STATEMENT WELCOMING LAHUD\'S ELECTION AND </p><p>EXPRESSING OUR HOPE THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE AND STRENGTHENING </p><p>OF INSTITUTIONS WILL MARK HIS TENURE MAKES THE RIGHT POINTS. </p><p>WE WILL BE PRESSING THOSE SAME THEMES IN OUR OWN DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH LAHUD AND IN OUR ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH HIS FUTURE </p><p>COLLEAGUES BERRI AND HARIRI.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>SATTERFIELD </p><p></p></div>
