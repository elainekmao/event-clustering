<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000271 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, ECON, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S BANKS: HOPING FOR THE BEST, EXPECTING THE </p><p>WORST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. RANGOON 249 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 30 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Week two of the banking crisis started with </p><p>grand hopes of a resolution to liquidity problems, but closed </p><p>with little change in the overall situation.  The GOB started </p><p>the week strong, with the apparent extension of Central Bank </p><p>loans on the 24th, but remained disturbingly silent and </p><p>inactive the rest of the week.  Banks continue to hemorrhage </p><p>deposits, and are maintaining, and in some cases reducing, </p><p>their withdrawal limits.  Despite a stalled economy, and </p><p>without significant assistance from the banks, companies </p><p>scrimped and saved to ensure payday passed on the 28th with </p><p>no apparent disruption.  However, it appears employers may </p><p>have used up their last reserves to meet payroll, and may </p><p>have little left to face any future shocks.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Banks Still in Doldrums </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Rumors at the beginning of the week that Burma\'s </p><p>private banks would lift their weekly withdrawal limits by </p><p>February 26 proved to be greatly exaggerated.  It is clear </p><p>that some private banks are having more trouble than others, </p><p>but all are in increasingly desperate straits.  All private </p><p>banks maintained withdrawal ceilings throughout the week. </p><p>However, until February 27, some were still able to provide </p><p>500,000 kyat (about $500) per week to customers.  By fiat of </p><p>the Myanmar Banking Association, as of February 27 all banks </p><p>were told to reduce their weekly limits to no more than </p><p>100,000 kyat (though some banks were reportedly only able to </p><p>provide 50,000 kyat per customer/week).  Bankers report </p><p>dismal conditions at branches across Burma, though the </p><p>tightest situations remain in Rangoon and Mandalay. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to our calculations, over the course of this </p><p>week the combination of tokens and withdrawal limits applied </p><p>by the banks allowed for withdrawals of at most 30 billion </p><p>kyat.  In fact, banking sources say that net outflows were </p><p>likely quite close to the full 30 billion -- a bad sign for </p><p>the banks.  AWB, KBZ, and the other large banks have been </p><p>willing in a very few cases to lift their withdrawal limits </p><p>slightly for major depositors who needed emergency cash to </p><p>meet their payrolls.  However, the amounts that the banks </p><p>actually allowed to be withdrawn were reportedly far lower </p><p>than their customers demanded.  Two bankers reported that </p><p>military intelligence insisted on vetting all requests for </p><p>emergency withdrawals, approving very few. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On the plus side, bankers reported some return of </p><p>deposits (mostly into so-called "guaranteed" accounts). </p><p>However, the number of returnees was relatively </p><p>insignificant.  Likewise, businesspeople report that the </p><p>banks asked borrowers to repay immediately between 25-40 </p><p>percent of their outstanding balances.  However, business and </p><p>banking sources have told us that borrowers have no ability </p><p>to repay since commerce has slowed to a halt and companies </p><p>are conserving every kyat on hand to pay employees and other </p><p>current expenses.  We\'ve heard rumors as well that banks have </p><p>sold or are trying to sell some of their real assets in an </p><p>effort to bolster cash reserves. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) All in all, the total estimated withdrawals this week </p><p>make the total outflow over the last two weeks roughly 230 </p><p>billion kyat (about 200 percent of estimated cash on hand in </p><p>all private banks at the beginning of the crisis).  In </p><p>response, the GOB this week reportedly extended 33 billion </p><p>kyat in loans to the three most troubled banks (AWB, Yoma, </p><p>KBZ).  The Central Bank also allegedly loaned 20 billion kyat </p><p>to three second-tier banks (MUB, MOB, and Mayflower). </p><p>However, comments from some bankers (including Yoma Bank\'s </p><p>General Manager) have raised some questions as to whether all </p><p>of these Central Bank advances ever were actually made. </p><p> </p><p>Wages Will Be Paid, But No Thanks to Banks </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The limited exceptions to the withdrawal limits </p><p>described above were not adequate to bail out most companies </p><p>facing payroll on February 28.  Despite this, businesspeople </p><p>were nervously optimistic that they would be able to pay </p><p>their workers on time.  Garment firms, and other </p><p>export-oriented industries, are paid in foreign exchange. </p><p>These industries have cashed in some of their dollar reserves </p><p>(at a relatively poor exchange rate) to get enough kyat to </p><p>pay salaries.  Other firms with kyat revenues are following </p><p>the same model, cashing in real assets or borrowing money </p><p>from private lenders using these assets as collateral. </p><p>Traders are cutting back on their purchases this week, at a </p><p>cost to commerce, in order to conserve cash for payday.  The </p><p>bottom line as of the end of February 28th, is that we\'ve not </p><p>seen or heard any evidence that employers have failed to meet </p><p>their obligations. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The mad dash to cash in dollars combined with people\'s </p><p>high expectations and the disappointing reality have had a </p><p>strong impact on the dollar/kyat market.  After dipping </p><p>briefly to 800 kyat last week, the dollar recovered on </p><p>expectations of firm government action, back up to 1060 on </p><p>February 25.  When withdrawal limits did not come off, and </p><p>when employers realized they were on their own, the dollar\'s </p><p>value dropped rapidly to 950 kyat/dollar on February 27, </p><p>where it remained through February 28. </p><p> </p><p>How Long Can it Last? </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Economists, bankers, and businesspeople are unclear </p><p>how long the crisis will last, though there is no optimism </p><p>that a solution is in the offing.  Though Burma has suffered </p><p>nearly every economic indignity imaginable, a banking crisis </p><p>is relatively uncharted waters.  Bankers continue to hope </p><p>that at a minimum the GOB will be willing to add new money to </p><p>meet demands for liquidity.  Even the most optimistic </p><p>observers, though, are less sure that the government will </p><p>take the correct steps to fully heal the patient (e.g., by </p><p>liberalizing the conditions under which the banks operate) </p><p>when and if the bleeding is stanched. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
