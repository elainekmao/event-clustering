<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 DAMASCUS 006308 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PREL, ETRD, BEXP, US, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  ASAD INSIDER SEES BASHAR COMING TO HELP, </p><p>          WANTS TO SELL U.S. AIRPLANES </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  MUHAMMAD MAKHLUF TOLD US HIS NEPHEW </p><p>BASHAR AL-ASAD IS RETURNING TO DAMASCUS SOON (AFTER </p><p>MILITARY TRAINING IN HIMS) TO TAKE UP FULL TIME HIS </p><p>LATE BROTHER BASIL\'S FORMER PORTFOLIO IN DOMESTIC </p><p>AFFAIRS.  HE DOES NOT, HOWEVER, SEE MUCH OF A ROLE </p><p>FOR BASHAR IN LEBANON.  MAKHLUF SAID THAT, AFTER </p><p>PEACE, SYRIA WOULD WITHDRAW FROM LEBANON, OR REMAIN </p><p>ONLY AT LEBANESE INSISTENCE.  ACCORDING TO MAKHLUF, </p><p>SYRIA WILL CONTINUE TO REJECT SECRET TALKS WITH THE </p><p>ISRAELIS, AND WILL INSIST ON A CONTINUED U.S. ROLE, </p><p>WHICH IT SEES AS ESSENTIAL THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. </p><p>HE ADDED THAT THE U.S. WAS NAIVE TO PROMOTE DIRECT </p><p>ISRAELI/ARAB CONTACTS BECAUSE THEY WOULD PROMOTE </p><p>ONLY ISRAELI, NOT U.S. INTERESTS.  ON AFFAIRS </p><p>CLOSER TO HIS POCKETBOOK, MAKHLUF SAID THAT HE </p><p>WOULD BE THE ONLY EFFECTIVE AGENT FOR BOEING. </p><p>MAKHLUF\'S WORDS REFLECT BOTH THE TYPE OF VIEWS THAT </p><p>ASAD HEARS AND HIS CURRENT POLICY LINE.    END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN A DECEMBER 15 CONVERSATION WITH THE DCM AND </p><p>ECONOFF, PRESIDENT ASAD\'S BROTHER-IN-LAW, MUHAMMAD </p><p>MAKHLUF, SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S OLDEST LIVING </p><p>SON, BASHAR WOULD SOON TAKE UP FULLY HIS DECEASED </p><p>OLDER BROTHER BASIL\'S FORMER ROLE AS THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S EYES AND EARS IN SYRIAN SOCIETY. </p><p>BASHAR RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM AN ARMOR SCHOOL IN </p><p>HIMS AND WILL RETURN TO DAMASCUS ON DECEMBER 20. </p><p>ACCORDING TO MAKHLUF, BASHAR WILL BE PRIMARILY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE PROPER OPERATION OF </p><p>SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, MANY OF WHICH, SAID </p><p>MAKHLUF, ARE RIVEN WITH INCOMPETENCE AND </p><p>CORRUPTION.  PRESIDENT ASAD, MAKHLUF NOTED, HAD HAD </p><p>TO CARRY TOO LARGE A BURDEN SINCE BASIL\'S DEATH, </p><p>AND BASHAR SHOULD NOW BE IN A POSITION TO SHOULDER </p><p>SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF RULING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN RESPONSE TO THE DCM\'S QUESTION, MAKHLUF </p><p>INDICATED THAT, UNLIKE BASIL, BASHAR WOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN LEBANON (SEE REPORTING IN </p><p>OTHER CHANNELS POINTING TO HIS AND LEBANESE </p><p>LEADERS\' EFFORTS TG BUILD TIES TO ONE ANOTHER), AND </p><p>WOULD FOCUS ON THE SYRIAN INTERNAL SCENE.  MAKHLUF </p><p>SAID THAT THE PRESS OF FOREIGN POLICY, INCLUDING </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS AND INTENSIFIED RELATIONS WITH </p><p>EGYPT, LEFT LITTLE TIME FOR ASAD TO DEAL WITH </p><p>DOMESTIC ISSUES, THUS CREATING A VACUUM, WHICH </p><p>BASHAR WOULD NOW BE EXPECTED TO FILL.  MAKHLUF </p><p>EMPHASIZED BASHAR\'S FITNESS FOR HIS NEW ROLE, </p><p>CLAIMING THAT A FEW MONTHS OF TRAINING HAD MADE HIM </p><p>A "REAL MILITARY MAN."  (COMMENT:  SINCE MOST </p><p>POLITICAL FIGURES OF ANY CONSEQUENCE IN SYRIA HAVE </p><p>MILITARY BACKGROUNDS, BASHAR\'S HAVING THEORETICALLY </p><p>BECOME A SOLDIER LENDS HIM AT LEAST A FACADE OF </p><p>CREDIBILITY.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>SYRIA WANTS OUT OF LEBANON, UNLESS... </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  ON THE SUBJECT OF SYRIA\'S PRESENCE IN LEBANON, </p><p>MAKHLUF COMPLAINED ABOUT THE COSTS, BOTH FINANCIAL </p><p>AND IN LOSS OF READINESS, FOR THE SYRIAN MILITARY. </p><p>HE SAID THAT, WITH PEACE, SYRIA WOULD WITHDRAW FROM </p><p>LEBANON.  MAKHLUF FOLLOWED THIS SEEMINGLY EMPHATIC </p><p>STATEMENT WITH THE QUALIFIER THAT THIS POLICY WAS </p><p>FIRM, UNLESS, OF COURSE, THE GOL "INSISTED" THAT </p><p>SOME SYRIAN FORCES REMAIN. HE ADDED THAT, WITH </p><p>PEACE, HIZBALLAH WOULD BE "ELIMINATED" (AS A </p><p>MILITARY ENTITY) BY THE LEBANESE ARMED FORCES, </p><p>WITH SYRIAN SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFITS TO LEBANON OF </p><p>SYRIA\'S PRESENCE IN LEBANON, MAKHLUF CITED ACTIVITY </p><p>AGAINST THE "POISON" OF NARCOTICS, SAYING THAT </p><p>SYRIA HAD SUCCEEDED IN ELIMINATING NARCOTICS </p><p>CULTIVATION IN ITS NEIGHBOR\'S LAND, WHERE THE U.S. </p><p>HAD FAILED IN SIMILAR ATTEMPTS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN REPONSE TO THE DCM\'S STATEMENT THAT WE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE SYRIA\'S AND LEBANON\'S EFFECTIVE ACTIONS </p><p>AGAINST CULTIVATORS, BUT WANT MORE DONE AGAINST THE </p><p>UBIQUITOUS PROCESSING LABS, MAKHLUF CLAIMED THAT </p><p>SYRIA DID NOT WANT TO INTERFERE WITH LEBANON\'S </p><p>DAILY OPERATIONS BECAUSE SUCH ACTIVITIES INEVITABLY </p><p>LED TO CRITICISM OF SYRIA FOR DEROGATING LEBANESE </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY, A FACTOR WHICH HE ALSO CLAIMED KEPT </p><p>SYRIAN TROOPS FROM CONDUCTING LARGE, VISIBLE </p><p>TRAINING OPERATIONS IN LEBANON.  INSTEAD, SYRIA </p><p>PREFERRED TO KEEP ITS TROOPS LARGELY IN THEIR </p><p>GARRISONS AND RESPOND ONLY TO LEBANESE REQUESTS FOR </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  MAKHLUF LAMENTED SYRIA\'S INABILITY TO </p><p>PUBLICIZE ITS "GOOD DEEDS" IN LEBANON, SUCH AS </p><p>RECONCILING ITS LEADERS OR COMBATTING DRUGS BECAUSE </p><p>SUCH WORDS WOULD BE EXPLOITED TO CRITICIZE SYRIA\'S </p><p>BENEFICENT ROLE. </p><p> </p><p>LATEST LINE ON THE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  MAKHLUF LARGELY STUCK TO THE CURRENT SYRIAN </p><p>PUBLIC LINE ON THE PEACE PROCESS.  THE PRESIDENT, </p><p>INDEED, HAD MADE A STRATEGIC DECISION FOR PEACE, </p><p>BUT HE WOULD INSIST THAT IT BE WITH DIGNITY AND </p><p>HONOR.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT SYRIA INSISTS ON A </p><p>CONTINUED U.S. ROLE AND THAT SECRET, DIRECT TALKS </p><p>WITH ISRAEL WERE UNACCEPTABLE.  MAKHLUF REITERATED </p><p>ASAD\'S COMMITMENT TO THE PEACE PROCESS UNDER U.S. </p><p>AUSPICES, BUT CONSTANTLY EXPRESSED SUSPICIONS ABOUT </p><p>ISRAEL\'S ULTIMATE INTENTIONS.  CHARACTERISTICALLY, </p><p>HE DERIDED THE ISRAELI AGREEMENTS WITH THE PLO AND </p><p>JORDAN.  MAKHLUF SAID THAT ASAD WOULD ONLY LOOK FOR </p><p>A STRATEGY OTHER THAN U.S. MEDIATION IF HE FELT </p><p>THAT SUCH MEDIATION ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT WORK. </p><p>(COMMENT:  THIS LAST EXPRESSION WAS AMBIGUOUS, BUT </p><p>IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY TO BE AN IMPLICIT THREAT OF </p><p>RENEWED PROXY VIOLENCE, THAN CONSIDERATION OF </p><p>DIRECT TALKS.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>9.  MAKHLUF SAID THAT A FRIEND OF HIS VISITING THE </p><p>U.S. HAD BEEN APPROACHED BY A "SENIOR AMERICAN JEW" </p><p>WHO SAID THAT SYRIA COULD DO FAR BETTER DEALING </p><p>DIRECTLY WITH ISRAEL THAN THROUGH THE U.S., AND </p><p>OFFERED TO BROKER SUCH CONTACTS.   MAKHLUF SAID HE </p><p>HAD SENT HIS FRIEND TO TELL HIS STORY TO THE </p><p>FONMIN, BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO CHANGE IN ASAD\'S </p><p>POLICY ON THE BASIS OF THIS OR ANY OTHER ISRAELI </p><p>APPROACH.  MAKHLUF SAID THAT SYRIA WANTS A REAL </p><p>PEACE, NOT A FAKE OR A FANTASY PEACE, AS EXISTS </p><p>BETWEEN ISRAEL AND SOME OF THE OTHER ARABS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  MAKHLUF ADDED THAT HIS READING OF HISTORY </p><p>CONVINCED HIM THAT THE ISRAELIS/JEWS ONLY PROTECTED </p><p>THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND THAT THE U.S. WAS </p><p>DISPLAYING "NAIVETE" IN PROMOTING ISRAELI/GULF </p><p>CONTACTS.  (COMMENT:  THIS REMARK ALLUDES TO AN </p><p>EARLIER CONVERSATION MAKHLUF HAD WITH US IN WHICH </p><p>HE WARNED THAT ISRAEL SOUGHT TO DOMINATE TRADE IN </p><p>THE REGION\'S OIL TO THE DETRIMENT OF U.S. STRATEGIC </p><p>AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS.)  MAKHLUF EXPRESSED </p><p>MYSTIFICATION AS TO WHY THE ISRAELIS WOULD WANT </p><p>DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH SYRIA, SINCE WITHOUT U.S. </p><p>SUPPORT, THERE WOULD BE NO ISRAEL. </p><p> </p><p>MAKHLUF WANTS "TO HELP" BOEING </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  AFTER A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE DESIRABILITY </p><p>OF INCREASED U.S. PARTICIPATION IN THE SYRIAN </p><p>ECONOMY, MAKHLUF QUICKLY TURNED THE DISCUSSION TO </p><p>BOEING\'S INTEREST IN SELLING CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT TO </p><p>SYRIAN ARAB AIRLINES (SAA).  AFTER STATING THAT </p><p>BOEING\'S CURRENT LOCAL AGENT WAS HIS "FRIEND," </p><p>MAKHLUF WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT COMPETENT TO </p><p>MAKE THIS DEAL.  AIRBUS, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAD </p><p>MADE SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS IN ITS PROPOSED DEAL </p><p>WITH SAA AND WAS NEARLY READY TO SIGN.  IN ANSWER </p><p>TO ECONOFF\'S QUESTION ABOUT THE UTILITY OF ANY </p><p>AGENT SINCE THE PRESIDENT WOULD DECIDE PERSONALLY </p><p>ABOUT THIS PURCHASE, MAKHLUF SAID THAT EVEN THE </p><p>PRESIDENT COULD NOT DECIDE ON BOEING IF AIRBUS </p><p>OFFERED A MUCH BETTER DEAL, AND THE RIGHT AGENT </p><p>COULD ENSURE THAT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE.  NOT </p><p>SURPRISINGLY, MAKHLUF THEN SAID THAT HE AND HIS SON </p><p>WANTED VERY MUCH TO MEET WITH BOEING.  ECONOFF SAID </p><p>HE WOULD CONVEY THIS INFORMATION TO BOEING. </p><p> </p><p>12.  COMMENT:  MAKHLUF, WHO IS NOT WITHOUT A </p><p>CERTAIN ROGUISH CHARM, NEVERTHELESS WEARS HIS </p><p>BIGOTRY AND AVARICE ON HIS WELL-TAILORED SLEEVE. </p><p>WE CONVEY HIS VIEWS AS AN INDICATION OF WHAT ASAD </p><p>IS LIKELY TELLING TO AND HEARING FROM THOSE AROUND </p><p>HIM.  HIS COMMENTS ON THE NEED FOR BASHAR TO BECOME </p><p>MORE ACTIVE ON THE DOMESTIC SCENE ARE CONSISTENT </p><p>WITH ALL OTHER REPORTING AVAILABLE TO US.  HOWEVER, </p><p>DESPITE MAKHLUF\'S COMMENTS TO THE CONTRARY </p><p>PRESIDENT ASAD SEEMS TO BE USING BASHAR AND GID </p><p>OPERATIVE NASSIF AS COUNTERWEIGHTS TO KHADDAM AND </p><p>SHIHABI IN LEBANON.  AS FOR THE PEACE PROCESS, </p><p>MAKHLUF\'S BLUNT COMMENTS ACCURATELY REFLECT THE </p><p>SUSPICIONS WITH WHICH ASAD AND HIS INNER CIRCLE </p><p>VIEW ISRAELI INTENTIONS, AND THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>THE WEAKNESS OF THEIR OWN MILITARY/DIPLOMATIC </p><p>POSITION VIS A VIS ISRAEL.  FOR THEM, THE U.S. ROLE </p><p>IS ESSENTIAL AND THE DEALS CONCLUDED BETWEEN ISRAEL </p><p>ON THE ONE HAND AND JORDAN AND THE PLO ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAVE ONLY REINFORCED THIS CONVICTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROSS </p><p></p></div>
