<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 001769 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IRAQ TASK FORCE, ALSO NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, </p><p>PRM/ANE, AND IO/UNP </p><p>KUWAIT FOR HOC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: UAEG OFFERS MEDICAL TREATMENT TO </p><p>INJURED IRAQIS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABU DHABI 1662 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  The Office of the Chairman of the General Health </p><p>Authority for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi Hamed bin Zayid </p><p>Al-Nahyan publicly announced on April 13 that the UAE </p><p>Red Crescent Authority (RCA) has been authorized to </p><p>transport wounded Iraqi civilians to the UAE for </p><p>medical treatment.  The spokesman said that the UAEG </p><p>recognizes that Iraqi hospitals are simply overwhelmed </p><p>by the number of patients, and the types of trauma </p><p>encountered, since the onset of hostilities in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>2.  According to press reports, each state-run hospital </p><p>in Abu Dhabi Emirate reserves part of its facilities to </p><p>treat foreign patients in extraordinary circumstances. </p><p>The medical care would be provided free of charge, and </p><p>the RCA would arrange for the transport of the wounded </p><p>from Iraq.  Comment: The announcement is not unusual </p><p>for the UAEG, which also offered free medical treatment </p><p>to wounded Palestinians following the devastation of </p><p>the Jenin refugee camp last year.  We will seek to </p><p>coordinate this effort with the RCA through the </p><p>Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) in Kuwait, and </p><p>provide further details when we receive them.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
