<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 HARARE 000939 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AID FOR DCHA/FFP LANDIS, CRUMBLY, MUTAMBA, PETERSEN </p><p>DCHA/OFDA FOR KHANDAGLE, BORNS, HALMRAST-SANCHEZ </p><p>AFR FOR COPSON, FORT, BAKER, MACNAIRN </p><p>STATE/AF FOR RAYNOR, DELISI </p><p>PRETORIA FOR DIJKERMAN, HELM, DISKIN </p><p>NAIROBI FOR DEPREZ, RILEY, HALE </p><p>LILONGWE FOR RUBEY </p><p>LUSAKA FOR GUNTHER </p><p>MAPUTO FOR POLAND, BLISS </p><p>MASERU FOR BELLEGARDE </p><p>MBABANE FOR KENNA </p><p>ROME FOR FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, EFIN, PREL, US, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  POOR 2003 AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION </p><p>PROSPECTS MEAN CONTINUED FOOD INSECURITY IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  A USAID BUREAU FOR DEMOCRACY CONFLICT AND </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE (DCHA) PRELIMINARY RAPID </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF PROSPECTS FOR THE CURRENT HARVEST </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT PARTS OF ZIMBABWE ONCE AGAIN FACE </p><p>FAILED HARVESTS AND LIMITED MARKET ACCESS TO FOOD </p><p>DUE TO A COMBINATION OF POOR RAINFALL, COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARM CLOSURES, LACK OF INPUTS, AND COUNTER </p><p>PRODUCTIVE FOOD MARKETING POLICIES.  ADDITIONALLY, </p><p>THE GMB IS EXPECTED TO HAVE LESS CAPACITY (FOREX) </p><p>TO IMPORT FOOD OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  WHILE IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT NATIONAL AGGREGATE </p><p>PRODUCTION WILL BE MARKEDLY HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR, </p><p>IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION </p><p>WILL IMPROVE FOR MANY HOUSEHOLDS, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>THE SOUTH WHERE MUCH OF THE CEREAL CROP HAS BEEN A </p><p>COMPLETE WRITE-OFF.  MISGUIDED GOZ MARKET POLICIES </p><p>CONTINUE TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ACCESS MAIZE AND </p><p>WHEAT IN MARKETS, AFFECTING NEARLY EVERYONE IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  GENERAL ECONOMIC DECLINE, POLITICAL </p><p>TUMULT AND HIV/AIDS ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIFFICULT </p><p>FOOD SECURITY SITUATION. DIFFERING CROP FORECASTS </p><p>HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE, THE FAMINE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM NETWORK </p><p>AND THE COMMERCIAL RARMERS UNION, RANGING FROM </p><p>800,000 MT TO 1.5 MILLION MT. ALTHOUGH MORE </p><p>DEFINITIVE ASSESSMENT RESULTS ARE STILL SEVERAL </p><p>WEEKS AWAY [SEE MISSION COMMENT, PARA 16.], </p><p>INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO POST AT THIS POINT </p><p>SUGGESTS THAT MANY COMMUNAL FARMERS WILL REMAIN </p><p>DEPENDENT ON FOOD AID FOR MUCH OF 2003.  IT IS NOT </p><p>POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE A BINDING ESTIMATE OF NEED </p><p>UNTIL FINAL HARVEST FIGURES BECOME AVAILABLE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN MOST AREAS, FOOD AID NEEDS WILL BE REDUCED </p><p>AS A RESULT OF THE MAY/JUNE HARVEST.  DURING THIS </p><p>TIME, FOCUS SHOULD BE ON IMPROVED TARGETING OF FOOD </p><p>AID, INCLUDING FOOD-FOR-WORK, TO REACH THE MOST </p><p>VULUNERABLE MORE EFFECTIVELY.  NON-FOOD ASSISTANCE </p><p>PRIORITIES INCLUDE SEEDS AND OTHER INPUTS FOR </p><p>COMMUNAL FARMERS, AND SUPPORT FOR U.N. HUMANITARIAN </p><p>COORDINATION AND MONITORING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>OVERVIEW OF ASSESSMENT MISSION </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. AS PART OF A LARGER USAID REGIONAL ASSESSMENT TO </p><p>DETERMINE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE NEEDS FOR 2003/04, </p><p>TWO TEAMS COMPOSED OF OFFICERS FROM THE OFFICES OF </p><p>FOOD FOR PEACE (FFP) AND U.S. FOREIGN DISASTER </p><p>ASSISTANCE (OFDA) AND A FAMINE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM </p><p>(FEWSNET) ADVISOR UNDERTOOK A QUALITATIVE FOOD </p><p>SECURITY ASSESSMENT THROUGHOUT ZIMBABWE MARCH 17 TO </p><p>28.  TEAMS INTERVIEWED MORE THAN 60 FARMER </p><p>HOUSEHOLDS IN EIGHT PROVINCES AS WELL AS UN, NGO </p><p>AND GOZ REPRESENTATIVES.  HOUSEHOLD INTERVIEWS </p><p>FOCUSED ON COMMUNAL AREAS, WITH ONLY A HANDFUL OF </p><p>INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED IN RESETTLED FARMING AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR THIS YEAR\'S HARVEST </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE MAJORITY OF FARMERS INTERVIEWED ESTIMATED </p><p>THAT THIS YEAR\'S HARVEST WOULD BE SOMEWHAT BETTER </p><p>THAN LAST YEAR\'S, WITH PRODUCTION COVERING ZERO TO </p><p>SIX MONTHS\' NEEDS.  OBSERVATIONS OF STANDING CROPS </p><p>IN THE FIELD CONFIRMED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF </p><p>HOUSEHOLDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE MATABELELAND </p><p>PROVINCES AND THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF MIDLANDS AND </p><p>MASVINGO PROVINCES, WOULD REALIZE LITTLE OR NO </p><p>PRODUCTION THIS YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IN THE GENERALLY MORE PRODUCTIVE PROVINCES OF </p><p>MASHONALAND (EAST, CENTRAL AND WEST) AND </p><p>MANICALAND, LATE RAINS IMPROVED PRODUCTION </p><p>PROSPECTS.  TOTAL AREAS PLANTED, HOWEVER, HAVE </p><p>DECLINED FROM PRIOR HISTORICAL AVERAGES, AND NGOS </p><p>POINTED OUT NUMEROUS PREVIOUSLY PRODUCTIVE FIELDS </p><p>LYING IDLE. WHILE THIS SURVEY DID NOT INCLUDE FARMS </p><p>CONFISCATED UNDER THE FAST-TRACK LAND </p><p>REDISTRIBUTION PROGRAM, SOURCES INTERVIEWED </p><p>INDICATED THAT PRODUCTION LEVELS ON THESE FARMS, </p><p>WHICH PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR BETWEEN 25 TO 45 </p><p>PERCENT OF TOTAL MAIZE PRODUCTION -- MUCH FOR ON- </p><p>FARM CONSUMPTION AND STOCK FEED-- WOULD BE POOR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  OVERALL, AGGREGATE NATIONAL MAIZE PRODUCTION IS </p><p>EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR, ALTHOUGH WELL </p><p>BELOW NATIONAL CONSUMPTION NEEDS.  EARLY </p><p>INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE HARVEST WILL BE IN THE </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD OF ONE MILLION MT OR MORE.  IF </p><p>CORRECT, THIS ESTIMATE WOULD BE ROUGHLY 60 PERCENT </p><p>OF NATIONAL CONSUMPTION REQUIREMENTS, AND ABOUT </p><p>HALF THE LEVEL OF 2000 (ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE </p><p>ROUGHLY DOUBLE THE 2002 LEVEL). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD SECURITY AND LIVELIHOODS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>8.  WHILE MOST HOUSEHOLDS HAVE WEATHERED THE CRISIS </p><p>UP TO NOW, AS ZIMBABWE ENTERS ITS THIRD CONSECUTIVE </p><p>YEAR OF POOR HARVESTS, FOOD SHORTAGES AND ECONOMIC </p><p>DECLINE, TEAMS ENCOUNTERED CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>COPING MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY DEPLETED. </p><p>MANY HOUSEHOLDS, PRIOR TO RECEIVING FOOD AID, WERE </p><p>RESORTING TO ADVERSE COPING MECHANISMS SUCH AS </p><p>SELLING PRODUCTIVE ASSETS, CONSUMING UNHEALTHY </p><p>FOODS, WITHDRAWING CHILDREN FROM SCHOOL AND </p><p>PROSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  MANY OF THE HOUSEHOLDS VISITED WERE </p><p>CHARACTERIZED BY UNUSUALLY HIGH NUMBERS OF ORPHANS, </p><p>ABSENCE OF WORKING AGE MEN AND DISPROPORTIONATE </p><p>NUMBERS OF WIDOWS, ELDERLY AND CHILD HEADS OF </p><p>HOUSEHOLDS.  IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GENERAL </p><p>DISINTEGRATION OF THE ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY, FURTHER </p><p>DEPLETION OF RURAL HOUSEHOLD ASSETS AND EROSION OF </p><p>BASIC RURAL LIVELIHOODS COULD LEAD TO INCREASED </p><p>MORTALITY AND REDUCED CAPACITY TO RECOVER IF AND </p><p>WHEN CONDITIONS BECOME MORE FAVORABLE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>PROJECTED EMERGENCY FOOD NEEDS IN 2003/04 </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  UNDER THE 2002/03 EMERGENCY OPERATION (EMOP), </p><p>WFP ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL POPULATION IN NEED OF </p><p>FOOD AID WOULD PEAK AT 7.2 MILLION BY MARCH 2003 </p><p>AND THEN DROP OFF IN APRIL 2003 AS THE NEW HARVEST </p><p>CAME IN.  WFP ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION LEVELS WERE </p><p>CONSISTENTLY FAR LESS THAN PLANNED LEVELS DUE TO </p><p>PIPELINE AND CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>WFP DISTRIBUTED 53,000 MT IN MARCH 2003 TO 4.6 </p><p>MILLION BENEFICIARIES (DISTRIBUTIONS THROUGH OTHER </p><p>PIPELINES BROUGHT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES </p><p>TO 5.7 MILLION).  DISTRIBUTION LEVELS ARE EXPECTED </p><p>TO FALL BY ABOUT 60 PERCENT IN MAY AND JUNE 2003. </p><p>WFP HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL USE THIS HARVEST </p><p>PERIOD TO DEVELOP MORE REFINED TARGETING CRITERIA </p><p>TO ENSURE THAT AID IS PROVIDED TO THOSE MOST IN </p><p>NEED.  THIS SITUATION WILL REQUIRE RENEWED EMPHASIS </p><p>ON MONITORING WFP AND OTHER NGO PROGRAM OPERATIONS </p><p>TO ENSURE THAT MORE SPECIFIC TARGETING CRITERIA ARE </p><p>PROPERLY ADHERED TO. </p><p> </p><p>11.  GIVEN THE COMBINATION OF POOR PRODUCTION, </p><p>DISFUNCTIONAL FOOD MARKETS AND THE BROADER EFFECTS </p><p>OF THE HIV/AIDS AND ECONOMIC CRISES, THE TOTAL </p><p>NUMBER OF ZIMBABWEANS REQUIRING FOOD AID BETWEEN </p><p>JULY 2003 AND MARCH 2004 WILL BE SIGNIFICANT, </p><p>ALTHOUGH AT THIS TIME THE NUMBER IS UNQUANTIFIABLE. </p><p>SEVERE SHORTAGES OF FOOD IN LOCAL MARKETS REMAIN A </p><p>MAJOR ELEMENT OF THE CRISIS.  AT THE CORE OF THE </p><p>FOOD AVAILABILITY PROBLEM ARE GOZ POLICIES, </p><p>INCLUDING THE GMB MONOPOLY ON MAIZE IMPORTS AND </p><p>SALES AND UNREALISTICALLY LOW FIXED PRICES FOR </p><p>STRATEGIC FOOD COMMODITIES SUCH AS MAIZE AND WHEAT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WHILE GMB\'S PERFORMANCE OVER THE PAST YEAR WAS </p><p>AT BEST ERRATIC, IT NONETHELESS DID DELIVER A </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL TONNAGE OF FOOD (APPROXIMATELY DOUBLE </p><p>THE AMOUNT OF INTERNATIONAL FOOD AID) INTO THE </p><p>MARKETS (BOTH THROUGH OFFICIAL SALES AND BLACK </p><p>MARKET DIVERSIONS).  BUT GIVEN THE DIRE FOREIGN </p><p>EXCHANGE POSITION IN WHICH THE GOZ NOW FINDS </p><p>ITSELF, THE GMB IS EXPECTED TO HAVE LESS CAPACITY </p><p>TO IMPORT FOOD OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  WHILE </p><p>MAIZE PRODUCTION MAY IMPROVE THIS YEAR IN MORE </p><p>PRODUCTIVE AREAS, HOUSEHOLDS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE </p><p>WILLING TO SELL TO GMB AT CONTROLLED PRICES UNLESS </p><p>COERCED.  THESE FACTORS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE </p><p>MARKET MAIZE AND WHEAT SUPPLIES, MAKING IT </p><p>INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR HOUSEHOLDS IN BOTH URBAN </p><p>AND RURAL AREAS TO ACCESS FOOD. </p><p> </p><p>13. AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE, THE PLIGHT OF UP TO </p><p>1.5 MILLION EX-COMMERCIAL FARM WORKERS AND THEIR </p><p>FAMILY MEMBERS REMAINS A PRIORITY HUMANITARIAN </p><p>CONCERN.  LACK OF ACCESS TO EX-COMMERCIAL FARMS </p><p>REMAINS AN OBSTACLE TO CONDUCTING A CREDIBLE </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  FOR ZIMBABWE TO EMERGE FROM THE CURRENT FOOD </p><p>SECURITY CRISIS, EMERGENCY FOOD AID IN 2003-04 </p><p>WOULD HAVE TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY SERIOUS POLICY </p><p>REFORMS TO IMPROVE THE SUPPLY OF GRAIN FOR SALE IN </p><p>LOCAL MARKETS AND ENSURE ACCESS TO INPUTS NEEDED TO </p><p>INCREASE PLANTED AREAS.  THE FOLLOWING ARE DCHA </p><p>TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS: </p><p> </p><p>A.  PROVIDE TARGETED FOOD AID FOR THE PERIOD JULY </p><p>2003 THROUGH MARCH 2004 FOR RURAL AREAS WHERE </p><p>ASSETS HAVE BEEN DEPLETED AND CURRENT YEAR </p><p>PRODUCTION PROSPECTS ARE POOR. </p><p> </p><p>B.  BEGIN A TRANSITION FROM GENERAL FOOD </p><p>DISTRIBUTIONS TO MORE TARGETED DISTRIBUTION </p><p>MECHANISMS INCLUDING FOOD-FOR-WORK. </p><p> </p><p>C.  EXPLORE WAYS TO PROVIDE FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR </p><p>VULUNERABLE URBAN/PERI-URBAN HOUSEHOLDS THROUGH </p><p>MARKET CHANNELS. </p><p> </p><p>D.  CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE PROVISION OF SEEDS FOR </p><p>COMMUNAL FARMERS, AND SUPPORT FOR HUMANITARIAN </p><p>COORDINATION AND MONITORING OF DONOR FOOD </p><p>DISTRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>E.  MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON THE GOZ TO PROVIDE ACCESS </p><p>TO RESETTLED FARM AREAS SO THAT THE UNMET NEEDS OF </p><p>EX-COMMERCIAL FARM WORKERS CAN BE MET BEFORE THEIR </p><p>SITUATION DETERIORATES FURTHER. </p><p> </p><p>F.  MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON THE GOZ TO ENACT POLICY </p><p>REFORMS THAT ALLOW FOOD MARKETS TO OPERATE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY AND INCREASE MARKET AVAILABILITY OF </p><p>FOOD. </p><p> </p><p>G.  DEVELOP A MEDIUM-TERM FOOD SECURITY RECOVERY </p><p>STRATEGY FOR ZIMBABWE THAT PROMOTES CROP </p><p>DIVERSIFICATION (MORE EXTENSIVE USE OF DROUGHT- </p><p>TOLERANT CROPS/VARIETIES) AND IMPROVED WATER </p><p>MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES. </p><p>--------------- </p><p>MISSION COMMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  IT MUST BE NOTED THAT ESTIMATES OF PROJECTED CROP </p><p>HARVESTS AND SHORTFALLS ARE CURRENTLY A PRIME OBJECT OF </p><p>SPECULATION IN HARARE.  FEWSNET HAS RELEASED ESTIMATES THAT </p><p>PROJECT A MAIZE HARVEST OF APPROXIMATELY 1.3 MILLION MT.  IN </p><p>SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEWS WITH USAID/HARARE STAFF, HOWEVER, </p><p>FEWSNET SAID THAT THE FIGURE IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO 1.1 </p><p>MILLION MT, AS THEIR PREVIOUS (MARCH) ESTIMATES HAD NOT </p><p>SUFFICIENTLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF </p><p>FAILED LATE-YEAR PLANTINGS.  (IN ADDITION, THE GOZ CLAIMS TO </p><p>HAVE CONTRACTED FOR AN ADDITIONAL 225,000MT NOT YET </p><p>DELIVERED.)  ON THE OTHER HAND, CURRENT NON-OFFICIAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES RANGE AS HIGH AS 1.5 MILLION MT; </p><p>HOWEVER, THE CREDIBILITY OF THESE LATTER ESTIMATES SUFFERS </p><p>SERIOUSLY DUE TO GOVERNMENT\'S KNOWN DESIRE TO CLAIM SUCCESS </p><p>IN ITS DISASTROUS LAND REDISTRIBUTION PROGRAM.  A MORE </p><p>ACCURATE DETERMINATION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION YIELDS AND </p><p>ASSISTANCE NEEDS WILL BE POSSIBLE ONCE ON-GOING ASSESSMENTS </p><p>ARE COMPLETED.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND CREDIBLE OF THESE IS </p><p>THE JOINT WFP/FAO CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY ASSESSMENT MISSION </p><p>(CFSAM) NOW UNDERWAY (WITH FEWSNET ASSISTANCE), WITH RESULTS </p><p>EXPECTED BY LATE-MAY.  IN ADDITION, MULTIPLE U.N. AGENCIES, </p><p>GOZ, NGOS, FEWSNET AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE CURRENTLY </p><p>COMPLETING THE LATEST UPDATE OF THE NATIONAL VULNERABILITY </p><p>ASSESSMENT (VAC), WITH RESULTS EXPECTED ALSO BY LATE-MAY. </p><p>FINALLY, THE RESULTS OF THE NATIONAL NUTRITION AND EPI (CHILD </p><p>IMMUNIZATION) SURVEY, COMPLETED BY UNICEF AND THE GOZ, ARE </p><p>ALSO EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED SHORTLY.  HENCE, THE MISSION </p><p>EXPECTS TO HAVE MORE CREDIBLE INFORMATION ON THE </p><p>CURRENT/PROJECTED COUNTRY FOOD SECURITY SITUATION WITHIN THE </p><p>NEXT FEW WEEKS.  WE WILL ADVISE WHEN RECEIVED.
