<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000695 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, CASC, PINR, NP, Nepali Government Policy </p><p>SUBJECT: STATE OF EMERGENCY RELAXED; ANTI-TERRORISM BILL </p><p>PASSES; ATTORNEY GENERAL RESIGNS </p><p> </p><p>REFS: A) KATHMANDU 672, B) 01 KATHMANDU 2302 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary.  Nepal\'s King on April 4 approved five </p><p>directives from the Cabinet easing restrictions on civil </p><p>liberties imposed under the state of emergency.  The </p><p>directives allow criticism - so long as it is not </p><p>"demoralizing" - of the security forces; restore press </p><p>freedoms, but not in the service of terrorism; and permit </p><p>recognized political parties to hold public gatherings. </p><p>In reaction, Nepal\'s Attorney General resigned April 4 in </p><p>apparent protest.  Also on April 4, Nepal\'s Parliament </p><p>passed the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control </p><p>and Punishment) Bill, which would codify an ordinance, </p><p>targeted against the Maoists, that was promulgated by the </p><p>Cabinet at the time the state of emergency was declared. </p><p>This bill now awaits the King\'s seal.  April 4\'s events </p><p>show that a measure of acceptance of the emergency </p><p>measures exists within Nepal\'s democratic institutions; </p><p>however, the new directives are unlikely to loosen the </p><p>ties of self-censorship currently restraining the Nepali </p><p>media.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Emergency Restrictions Eased </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Nepal\'s King Gyanendra gave his pro forma assent </p><p>April 4 to five Cabinet directives relaxing restrictions </p><p>on civil liberties imposed under the state of emergency </p><p>that began November 26, 2001.  The directives allow public </p><p>criticism of the security forces provided it is not </p><p>"demoralizing"; allow the publication and transmission of </p><p>news reports, articles or commentaries so long as they do </p><p>not aid terrorism; permit recognized political parties to </p><p>hold public meetings with the permission of district-level </p><p>authorities; and provide for the resumption of normal </p><p>procedures for civil service assignments and transfers. </p><p>The fifth directive specifies that matters not mentioned </p><p>in the bill shall be dealt with according to existing </p><p>laws.  The Prime Minister had been under pressure both </p><p>from within his own party and from opposition parties on </p><p>both ends of the ideological spectrum to ease restrictions </p><p>- especially those on political rallies (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>Attorney General Steps Down </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In reaction to the King\'s issuance of the </p><p>directives, Nepal\'s Attorney General resigned April 4 in </p><p>apparent protest.  A contact in the Attorney General\'s </p><p>Office confirmed that the AG had resigned because of </p><p>ongoing disagreements with the government over the </p><p>imposition of the legal framework for the emergency.  One </p><p>observer speculated that the AG had resigned because he </p><p>objected specifically to the loosening of restrictions </p><p>under the emergency.  Other sources told us that the </p><p>Attorney General - a political appointee - frequently </p><p>clashed with other Cabinet members.  A replacement is </p><p>expected to be named soon. </p><p> </p><p>Anti-Terrorism Bill Passes House </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Also on April 4, Nepal\'s Parliament passed the </p><p>Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and </p><p>Punishment) Bill.  The bill would codify a Royal Ordinance </p><p>declared along with the state of emergency last November </p><p>(Ref B).  It now goes to the Palace for the King\'s assent. </p><p>The law would then remain in effect for two years. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Parliament\'s acceptance of the anti-terrorism </p><p>ordinance promulgated along with the state of emergency </p><p>late last year shows that Nepal\'s democratic institutions </p><p>are accepting of the steps taken thus far to address the </p><p>country\'s current crisis.  The newly issued directives </p><p>will promote normalcy in some areas, as in the civil </p><p>service personnel system.  However, the measures related </p><p>to freedom of expression remain sufficiently ambiguous </p><p>that Nepal\'s press will likely continue to steer clear of </p><p>controversial reporting, including constructive criticism </p><p>of the security forces. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
