<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001802 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, AF/EX </p><p>USAID FOR AFR/SA MCOPSON; DCHA/FFP LLANDIS, DSKORIC </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/05/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, EAGR, PREL, PGOV, EFIN, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: OFFICIAL GOZ FIGURES ON FOOD IMPORTS AND PROJECTED </p><p>NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 01664 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHG REWhitehead due to 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  A senior Ministry of Finance official shared </p><p>with Charge details on GOZ food imports, and the gap still to </p><p>be filled.  The GOZ has purchased nearly 1,000,000 metric </p><p>tons (MT) of maize but, even with current projected donor </p><p>contributions factored in, still faces a shortfall of </p><p>approximately 600,000 MT over the March 2002 to June 2003 </p><p>period.  A number of GOZ projections seem to err toward </p><p>optimism, as does much of the plan for filling the remaining </p><p>gap.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On August 2, Ministry of Finance and Economic </p><p>Development Permanent Secretary Nick Ncube (strictly protect) </p><p>passed charge a full list of contracted GOZ maize purchases </p><p>and a brief worksheet totaling projected needs against </p><p>projected stocks.  Somewhat to our surprise, this material </p><p>indicates that the GOZ has already purchased 982,112 MT of </p><p>corn.  Ncube stated that the GOZ has already paid in full for </p><p>this amount from cash on hand and forex sequestered by the </p><p>Reserve Bank from tobacco sales.  Of the total amount, </p><p>347,870 MT have already arrived in country; an additional </p><p>637,011 MT will be delivered over the next months. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ncube provided a list of sellers that include Cargil </p><p>(sic) (253,000 MT contracted, 255,585 MT already delivered), </p><p>FSI Petta Trading (4,255 MT of which 3,850 delivered), </p><p>Farmers World (10,000 MT of which all but 29 delivered), ADM </p><p>Agri (10,000 MT of which all but 4 delivered), Blazepoint </p><p>(4,637 MT delivered), Holbud (209,000 MT of which 63,649 </p><p>delivered), CBZ Sentry (456,250 not yet delivered), Timpani </p><p>(25,000 MT not yet delivered), and Taminsa (10,000 MT not yet </p><p>delivered).  Based on the fact that the CBZ Sentry shipment </p><p>references a US contract number, we presume that this </p><p>shipment cannot be certified GMO-free. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ncube said that imports and committed imports added to </p><p>the estimated 500,000 MT of domestic production from last </p><p>spring yielded a total of 1,482,112 MT, balanced against </p><p>consumption needs of 2,400,000 MT over the March 2002 to June </p><p>2003 period, based upon a consumption figure of 150,000 MT </p><p>per month.  This leads to a shortfall of 917,888 MT.  The GOZ </p><p>was banking on potential early deliveries from January 2003 </p><p>to March 2003 of 200,000 MT from irrigated winter cultivation </p><p>and early green maize.  On top of this, they projected donor </p><p>contributions as 150,000 MT based upon an assumed figure of </p><p>USD 41 million, and maize imports running USD 250/MT.  This </p><p>left a shortfall of 567,888 MT.  Ncube said that these </p><p>figures were based upon belt-tightening, with most </p><p>Zimbabweans eating only breakfast and supper, and increased </p><p>maize substitution with potatoes, rice, wheat, sorghum, and </p><p>other grains. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Ncube said that he projected the following steps as </p><p>the way forward to closing the 600,000 MT gap, which would </p><p>cost an estimated USD 150 million.  First and foremost, the </p><p>GOZ hoped to mobilize additional donor support for 300,000, </p><p>which he admitted was an optimistic figure.  The second step </p><p>would be mobilization of the private sector for the remaining </p><p>300,000 MT, assuming that the GOZ would allow private sector </p><p>imports.  Finally, and most improbably (even Ncube admitted </p><p>this), the GOZ hoped to establish a foreign currency trust </p><p>account where donor groups would deposit their money for </p><p>maize supplied from the GOZ Grain Marketing Board (GMB), the </p><p>parastatal monopoly that is responsible for the 982,112 MT of </p><p>maize already purchased. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment:  We were surprised to learn that the GOZ has </p><p>scraped up the forex to pay for nearly 1,000,000 MT of maize, </p><p>but even this leaves a significant gap.  A number of the GOZ </p><p>assumptions about filling the shortfall also appear to be </p><p>overly optimistic.  The 200,000 MT from potential early </p><p>deliveries is by no means a certainty.  Donor contributions </p><p>will predictably continue to increase over the next months, </p><p>although it is too soon to predict if they will reach the </p><p>450,000 MT mark posited by the GOZ.  Private sector </p><p>participation remains a phantasm at this time, given the </p><p>absurdly skewed exchange rate, the concomitant unrealistic </p><p>GOZ-fixed price for maize meal, and continued GMB monopoly </p><p>over grain imports.  The foreign currency account, which </p><p>would presumably replace the proposed UN forex trust account </p><p>for the private sector, would directly funnel donor forex </p><p>into government accounts and does not bear further </p><p>consideration.  Ncube himself admitted that the blueprint for </p><p>addressing the food crisis contained a number of internal </p><p>contradictions, but intimated that political sensitivities </p><p>had required this approach.  What Ncube did not mention is </p><p>the strain that the GOZ maize purchases will put on other </p><p>sectors that require forex to function:  fuel, electricity, </p><p>medicines, et al.  The bottom line is that the GOZ will be as </p><p>much as USD 1.5 billion of forex short of what it needs </p><p>through June 2003, as outlined reftel.  End comment. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
