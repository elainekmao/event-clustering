This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for February 7, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  ERDOGAN AK PARTY\'S FIRST-LISTED CANDIDATE IN </p><p>SIIRT </p><p>(Tercuman/Dunya/Cumhuriyet/Turkiye)  AK Party </p><p>informed the Higher Election Council (YSK) that </p><p>its first-listed candidate in the March 9 Siirt </p><p>elections will be AK Party leader Recep Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan.  Necati Cetinkaya of the AK Party </p><p>submitted documents regarding Erdogan\'s candidacy </p><p>to YSK on February 6.  Mervan Gul, AK Party\'s </p><p>first-listed candidate from Siirt in the November </p><p>3 Parliamentary elections, had withdrawn from the </p><p>March 9 elections for Erdogan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  TURKEY\'S MISSILE SHIELD INSUFFICIENT </p><p>(Tercuman)  Turkish Military Electronics Industry </p><p>(ASELSAN) Secretary General (ret.) Colonel Serdar </p><p>Erdurmaz, in his book entitled "Weapons of Mass </p><p>Destruction in the Middle East, Weapons Control, </p><p>and Turkey," has written that Turkey\'s defenses </p><p>against nuclear, biological, and chemical warhead </p><p>attacks are inadequate.  However, Erdurmaz </p><p>pointed to two trump cards Turkey has:  its air </p><p>force and the deployment of anti-ballistic </p><p>missile systems in eastern and southeastern </p><p>Turkey, under the U.S. National Missile Defense </p><p>System. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>(Evrensel)  A cockfight was held in Elazig to </p><p>highlight protest against a possible U.S. attack </p><p>against Iraq.  Two roosters named "Saddam" and </p><p>"Bush" were made to fight, which ended with the </p><p>victory of "Saddam."  Also, a group of youths </p><p>issued an anti-war press release in front of </p><p>Elazig\'s Post Office.  Regarding a possible U.S.- </p><p>led war in Iraq, they said that remaining silent </p><p>in such a situation meant being involved in the </p><p>massacre of thousands of people in Iraq.  In </p><p>addition, the Tunceli Anti-War Platform decided </p><p>to stage new anti-war demonstrations on February </p><p>5.  Under the new decision, the Platform will </p><p>form "a peace chain against war" in the </p><p>provincial capital on Saturday.  The Platform </p><p>will also ask local merchants to close their </p><p>places of business for an hour. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  BOMB HOAX ON DIYARBAKIR PLANE </p><p>(Cumhuriyet/Turkiye/Diyarbakir)  A telephone call </p><p>that there was a bomb on Turkish Airlines\' (THY) </p><p>mid-February 6 Diyarbakir-Ankara plane caused </p><p>panic.  Shortly after take-off, the plane </p><p>returned to the airport and the passengers were </p><p>evacuated under intense security measures.  Bomb </p><p>experts searched the plane, but could not find </p><p>anything suspicious.  The plane took off again an </p><p>hour later, with its 99 passengers and crew. </p><p>Former State of Emergency (OHAL) Gokhan Aydiner, </p><p>who has been appointed the new Security Director </p><p>General, and former Diyarbakir Governor Cemil </p><p>Serhadli, were also on the plane. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  CONTINUED PRO-OCALAN DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE </p><p>SOUTHEAST </p><p>(Evrensel)  Hunger strikes launched in protest of </p><p>the isolation of jailed KADEK/PKK leader Abdullah </p><p>Ocalan continue in the Southeastern provinces of </p><p>Batman, Hakkari, Van, and Gaziantep.  Illegal </p><p>pro-Ocalan demonstrations were also held in those </p><p>provinces.  In Adana, ten women arrested for </p><p>staging a pro-Ocalan sit-down demonstration in </p><p>front of the Adana chapter of the AK Party were </p><p>released.  In addition, the HADEP Mayor of </p><p>Adana\'s Kucukdikili district, Mehmet Yasik, </p><p>called for support from all sectors so Turkey\'s </p><p>internal peace is not disrupted.  Yasik claimed </p><p>Ocalan\'s isolation and a possible U.S. attack </p><p>against Iraq were related. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  DIVORCED WOMAN KILLED FOR "WALKING AROUND </p><p>WITH MEN" </p><p>(Sabah)  In Diyarbakir, two brothers strangled </p><p>their 19-year-old sister, Gulseren T. on January </p><p>27, 2002, due to rumors that she was meeting with </p><p>men.  Gulseren had gotten divorced two years ago. </p><p>After killing Gulseren, they melted nylon on her </p><p>face in an attempt to make her body </p><p>unidentifiable and threw the body near a local </p><p>school.  The next day, teachers and students </p><p>found the body and informed the police, who </p><p>interrogated Gulserens\'s parents, who revealed </p><p>that Gulseren\'s two brothers had murdered her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  PULUMUR EARTHQUAKE </p><p>(Evrensel)  A delegation of professors from </p><p>Elazig\'s Firat University Geology Department </p><p>prepared a report regarding the January 27 </p><p>earthquake in Tunceli\'s Pulumur district.  The </p><p>report attributed most damage to the district\'s </p><p>public buildings to their construction on a slope </p><p>on an active fault line and their being multi- </p><p>storey structures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  SOUTHEASTERN TURKEY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT </p><p>(Dunya/Radikal/Evrensel)  The Turkish Garment </p><p>Industrialists Association (TGSD) and the </p><p>Southeastern Anatolia Industrialists and </p><p>Businessmen\'s Association (GUNSIAD) jointly </p><p>organized a meeting entitled "Effects of A </p><p>Possible War on the Turkish and Regional Economy" </p><p>in Diyarbakir.  Participants focused on ways of </p><p>getting out of a possible war with the least </p><p>loss.  Industrialists called for a regional </p><p>development plan.  TGSD President Umut Oran </p><p>pointed to the vital significance of qualified </p><p>industrial zones under the law number 4325, which </p><p>he wanted implemented as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  NEW CLA SIGNED IN MALATYA MUNICIPALITY </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Malatya Municipality has signed a </p><p>new collective labor agreement (CLA) covering its </p><p>500 employees.  CLA foresees a 15% increase in </p><p>the employees\' salaries within the first six </p><p>months and a 10% increase within the second six </p><p>months.  In addition, Adana\'s Agricultural </p><p>Complex (Cukobirlik) has paid its workers a total </p><p>of TL 1.5 trillion (approx. USD 900,000) under a </p><p>recent CLA signed between Cukobirlik and a labor </p><p>union. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  COURT REVERSES WATER PRICE HIKE </p><p>(Hurriyet)  The Adana Metropolitan Municipality\'s </p><p>Water and Sewage Administration (ASKI) "secretly" </p><p>increased the price of its drinking water, as </p><p>well as wastewater discharged from homes and </p><p>places of business, by 360% in 2002.  Three </p><p>Municipal Council members petitioned the Adana </p><p>Administrative Court to reverse the price hike. </p><p>The court reached a verdict reversing the price </p><p>hike.  Also, the Council of State upheld the </p><p>verdict.  Now, ASKI is expected to repay the </p><p>amount collected unjustly. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
