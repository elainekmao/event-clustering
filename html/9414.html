(U) The UAE representative to the weekly Iraq </p><p>reconstruction teleconference had provisionally offered to </p><p>have the UAE host the October donors\' conference for Iraq. </p><p>In a meeting with the Ambassador, Minstate for Foreign </p><p>Affairs Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed said that the UAEG is </p><p>formally offering to host the conference in Abu Dhabi and </p><p>would like USG support for the initiative.  He said that </p><p>Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed had </p><p>officially blessed the proposal and wants to hold it in Abu </p><p>Dhabi. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Comment and Action Request:  Post understands that </p><p>there has been some discussion of the venue for the </p><p>conference.  We believe that the UAE would be an </p><p>appropriate host for the conference.  The UAE has the </p><p>advantage of its regional location and good air </p><p>connections.  As the only Arab member of the "core group", </p><p>it can provide an additional level of legitimacy in the </p><p>Arab world for efforts to rebuild Iraq.  Post recommends </p><p>strongly that the USG consider supporting the UAEG offer. </p><p>End Comment and Action Request. </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
