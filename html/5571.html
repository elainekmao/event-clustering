Finn for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In a chance meeting with the Ambassador and Security </p><p>Coordinator MG Karl Eikenberry at the presidential palace on </p><p>February 4, a clearly pleased Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani </p><p>noted that Japan had come through with pledged funding the </p><p>day before.  As a result, Afghanistan was no longer in </p><p>arrears to the IFIs.  Canada was following through with </p><p>pledged funding as well, said Ghani, who asked the Ambassador </p><p>to pass his thanks on to Under Secretary Larson and Treasury </p><p>Under Secretary John Taylor for their efforts on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ghani said the defense budget would require intensive </p><p>work in the coming days.  He had made some progress with the </p><p>Defense Ministry on projected army size, and planned to </p><p>impose a sliding scale on the defense budget, with </p><p>progressively smaller amounts budgeted for salaries each year </p><p>until attrition reduced the total army size to a target </p><p>level.  Besides dealing with the defense budget, reducing the </p><p>total number of government ministries also was an imperative, </p><p>Ghani said. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Noting another step forward, Ghani said the Finance </p><p>Ministry had received 2 million USD in customs revenues from </p><p>Herat province.  This is in addition to 2 million USD Herat </p><p>gave the center last fall. </p><p>FINN </p><p></p></div>
