<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 002196 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR DEPUTY USTR AMBASSADOR HUNTSMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EINV, CE, USTR, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA: FIRST JOINT COUNCIL MEETING UNDER </p><p>NEW TIFA </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary: In the first Joint Council meeting under </p><p>the US - Sri Lanka TIFA, the GSL identified its goal as </p><p>an eventual Free Trade Agreement, and, in the interim, </p><p>stronger ties in the bilateral trade relationship and </p><p>in the WTO.  The US representatives focused on the USG </p><p>commitment to closer cooperation on the global trade </p><p>agenda and in the bilateral relationship, noting that </p><p>the peace process will bring confidence, which will </p><p>lead to new opportunities for the US private sector. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The first Trade and Investment Council meeting </p><p>under the recently-signed Trade and Investment </p><p>Framework Agreement was held in Colombo on November 20, </p><p>led by Deputy USTR Ambassador Jon Huntsman and Sri </p><p>Lankan Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, </p><p>Minister Ravi Karunanayake.  Representatives on the US </p><p>side included Ambassador Wills, USTR Senior Director </p><p>Elena Bryan, and Embassy Economic Officers.  The Sri </p><p>Lankan delegation of over 20 members included Minister </p><p>of Enterprise Development and Industrial Policy GL </p><p>Peiris, Board of Investment (BoI) Chairman Arjunna </p><p>Mahendran, Ambassador-Designate to the US Davinda </p><p>Subasinghe, the GSL representative to the WTO, KY </p><p>Weerasinghe, and many members of the Department of </p><p>Commerce. </p><p> </p><p>3. Minister Karunanayake stated at the start that the </p><p>ultimate goal of the GSL was a Free Trade Agreement </p><p>with the US, as soon as possible.  He outlined some </p><p>steps the GSL was taking which would make it a more </p><p>attractive FTA partner, including good governance, </p><p>pursuit of peace, closer relations with the US and </p><p>privatization.  Minister Peiris emphasized the </p><p>important role of trade and economic freedom in the </p><p>current GSL peace efforts, and said Sri Lanka needs a </p><p>stronger trade relationship with the US.  Ambassador </p><p>Huntsman outlined the US goals, including the desire to </p><p>strengthen ties, use the TIFA as a building block to </p><p>further shared commitments, and establish broad </p><p>cooperation on the global and bilateral trade agenda. </p><p>Ambassador Huntsman also explained his desire to bring </p><p>back a positive message to the US private sector about </p><p>new developments and opportunities in Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>Investment Opportunities </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>4. In the overview, BoI Chairman Mahendran said Sri </p><p>Lanka is taking advantage of the high profile recently </p><p>created by the peace process and the Prime Minister\'s </p><p>investment promotion trip to New York.  He said Sri </p><p>Lanka is fully compliant with labor best practices, and </p><p>ILO conventions.  He thought new opportunities for US </p><p>investment would be found in infrastructure projects </p><p>(especially ports and airports) to make Sri Lanka a </p><p>regional logistics hub, tourism, mineral extraction, </p><p>information and communications technology, apparel and </p><p>textiles, and agriculture.  When asked about </p><p>restrictions on foreign purchase of land and import of </p><p>seed varieties, Minister Karunanayake promised an </p><p>answer within two weeks. </p><p> </p><p>5. Ambassador Huntsman urged the GSL to act soon in </p><p>attracting US investors, and advised that a </p><p>predictable, stable, and transparent environment would </p><p>be critical.  Once the GSL had targeted specific </p><p>infrastructure needs, focused trade missions could come </p><p>from the US.  While describing the President\'s trade </p><p>agenda, Ambassador Huntsman emphasized that the Doha </p><p>Agenda was a high priority. </p><p> </p><p>IPR </p><p>--- </p><p>6. Dr. Karunanratne from the GSL IPR Office briefed the </p><p>Council on new IPR legislation that is expected to be </p><p>approved by Parliament by early next year.  He said it </p><p>goes beyond TRIPS, and incorporates comments submitted </p><p>by interested US parties.  Karunaratne said the GSL was </p><p>progressing aggressively on enforcement problems by </p><p>planning to train lawyers, judges, and enforcement </p><p>personnel, by designating the Commercial High Court for </p><p>cases, and by conducting public outreach.  He said the </p><p>GSL needed technical assistance in this area.  Both </p><p>Ambassador Wills and Ambassador Huntsman promised to </p><p>examine areas for possible US assistance. </p><p>WTO </p><p>--- </p><p>7. KJ Weerasinghe said that the solution to outstanding </p><p>issues is in implementation, and that Sri Lanka wants </p><p>to be constructive in accomplishing the Doha agenda. </p><p>On agriculture, he said, Sri Lanka agrees to </p><p>liberalization, but wants to protect poor, rural </p><p>farmers.  On tariff and subsidy reductions, the GSL </p><p>does not have these supports, but wants flexibility to </p><p>accommodate rural farmers and to mitigate the price </p><p>increase that net food importers would experience as </p><p>the new WTO proposals are adopted.  Sri Lanka does not </p><p>have any instrument, other than tariff levels, to </p><p>protect against import surges.  He relayed that the EU </p><p>had asked for the GSL\'s support on this.  He also said </p><p>the US proposal does not address special and </p><p>differentiated (S and D) treatment for LDCs. </p><p> </p><p>8. Ambassador Huntsman responded that it is important </p><p>to meet the March deadlines, and the US would work with </p><p>the GSL on these issues.  This was the only chance to </p><p>get agriculture on an international agenda.  He </p><p>continued that the US does not want a two-track system </p><p>with S and D countries, rather the same goals for all, </p><p>with the S and D treatment applying to the length of </p><p>the transition periods.  If there are two tracks, he </p><p>said, one may be seen as lower quality. </p><p> </p><p>9. Services: Weerasinghe said the current government </p><p>wants Sri Lanka to become a services hub and plans to </p><p>eliminate measures that would create market </p><p>impediments.  It had already liberalized many sectors, </p><p>and is currently looking at a strategy to open the </p><p>tertiary education and wholesale/retail sectors and </p><p>review the GATS commitment.  Both Minister Karunanayake </p><p>and Ambassador-designate Subasinghe noted that </p><p>education was a sensitive area.  Under services, </p><p>Weerasinghe said the GSL wants also to look at the </p><p>movement of persons to support and provide services </p><p>outside Sri Lanka.  He noted that Sri Lanka\'s list of </p><p>sectors to be liberalized, which would include air </p><p>transport, call/service centers and exchange controls </p><p>in the financial sector, would be ready by December. </p><p> </p><p>10. Market access: Weerasinghe said the GSL was waiting </p><p>to see what proposal would be made for reduction </p><p>commitments, and that Sri Lanka would have the same </p><p>problems as with agriculture if the Swiss formula is </p><p>applied.  He said there was a lack of clarity about the </p><p>removal or elimination of tariffs.  Ambassador Huntsman </p><p>replied that the US plans to take a comprehensive </p><p>approach and will submit its package in early December. </p><p> </p><p>11. Government procurement: Weerasinghe noted a number </p><p>of issues of concern: that it covers government but not </p><p>market aspects, the application to foreign procurement, </p><p>threshold adjustments for different size countries, </p><p>flexibility allowed for procurement objectives, and </p><p>whether a WTO decision could override a domestic </p><p>decision.  He said that the GSL would comment on the US </p><p>proposal the following week.  Ambassador Huntsman </p><p>conveyed his appreciation for Sri Lanka\'s commitment to </p><p>the process, and hoped that by the time of the Cancun </p><p>meeting differences would be resolved.  He continued </p><p>that the US would like to see Sri Lanka be a leader in </p><p>this area. </p><p> </p><p>12. Small Economies and Geographic Indicators: </p><p>Weerasinghe said that Sri Lanka should be included in </p><p>the group that would address problems and recommend </p><p>solutions, and that population should not be the </p><p>judgement criteria for membership.  Ambassador Huntsman </p><p>said that would be a practical approach, and that the </p><p>different transition periods would address the </p><p>different needs, rather than a two-tiered system.  On </p><p>Geographic Indicators, Weerasinghe said the GSL wanted </p><p>protection for items in addition to wine and spirits, </p><p>e.g., spices and tea.  Ambassador Huntsman cautioned </p><p>the GSL, saying it must be careful to consider what is </p><p>already protected under TRIPS (and the US Patent </p><p>Office), and make the most of that protection.  Since </p><p>the EU had tabled thousands of items for protection, </p><p>proliferation of geographic indicators could become a </p><p>nightmare for WTO. </p><p> </p><p>13. SPS and TBT: On SPS and TBT Agreements, Weerasinghe </p><p>said Sri Lanka had difficulties implementing the </p><p>provisions because it lacks administrative capacity, </p><p>personnel and equipment.  He requested Technical </p><p>Assistance to help Sri Lanka fulfill its obligations, </p><p>and later submitted a list outlining the GSL requests. </p><p>Ambassador Huntsman noted that the US intends to make </p><p>use of a variety of resources to assist, and that the </p><p>US team wants to hear how effective the WTO and USG </p><p>assistance is.  There are many sources of help, he </p><p>said, including aid, universities, businesses, and </p><p>trade associations.  He wanted to hear what worked and </p><p>what the Sri Lanka priorities are. </p><p> </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>---------- </p><p>14. Wrapping up, Minister Karunanayake said Sri Lanka </p><p>wants to receive the benefits of LDC status, and wants </p><p>an international partner in sectors such as phosphate </p><p>mining, tea and port building.  Sri Lanka, he said, </p><p>must show its commitment to carry out reforms, and work </p><p>toward a FTA with the US.  Ambassador Huntsman said </p><p>though that could be the ultimate goal, he warned </p><p>against getting ahead of the TIFA process and building </p><p>unrealistic expectations.   An incremental pace of </p><p>engaging the US, including developing the interest and </p><p>trust of the private sector, generating political </p><p>support and reducing the trade deficit (currently 10:1 </p><p>in Sri Lanka\'s favor) should be the GSL\'s medium term </p><p>goals.  Ambassador Huntsman said that the next Council </p><p>meeting could take place in WDC in Spring 2003.  He </p><p>committed to accompanying the Sri Lanka delegation to </p><p>Chambers of Commerce, and to help deepen and broaden </p><p>cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>Amselem </p><p></p></div>
