<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000681 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: INEC UNREADY AS BUHARI AND OBASANJO </p><p>CONTEST IN CLOSE RACE IN BENUE </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: POLOFF visited local party officials, </p><p>domestic and international election monitors, </p><p>academics, and local INEC officials during an April 3- </p><p>4 trip to Benue State.  Most believed violence is </p><p>likely if electoral manipulation is obvious.  Only a </p><p>few people believed INEC is prepared for the election. </p><p>Conversations confirmed that President Obasanjo is </p><p>still highly unpopular among significant numbers of </p><p>the Tiv, Benue\'s largest and one of Nigeria\'s biggest, </p><p>ethnic groups, because of the October 2001 massacre of </p><p>over 200 civilians at Zaki-Biam.  Obasanjo may win </p><p>Benue, but his victory is not assured.  Despite his </p><p>recent illness and convalescence in Europe, PDP </p><p>Governor George Akume is likely to be reelected.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On April 4, POLOFF paid an unannounced visit </p><p>to the Makurdi INEC headquarters.  The lack of </p><p>activity at the office was surprising considering less </p><p>than a week remained before the National Assembly </p><p>election.  Nevertheless, INEC officials claimed they </p><p>were ready and they did not expect problems on </p><p>election day.  POLOFF noted 20 cardboard boxes of </p><p>election materials drying in the sun after being </p><p>soaked in the pervious night\'s rain.  The INEC </p><p>administrative officer explained that these were </p><p>pamphlets and other "non-sensitive" materials.  He </p><p>said the actual ballots and other tamper prone items </p><p>were under lock and key at the Central Bank branch and </p><p>would be delivered to polling places on the morning of </p><p>the election.  Despite the poor condition of their </p><p>vehicular "fleet," the INEC officials expected to have </p><p>no trouble delivering the ballots on time so that the </p><p>polls could open as scheduled. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) INEC\'s optimism was extreme, but not </p><p>infectious.  Most other interlocutors were </p><p>pessimistic.  Opposition party members and election </p><p>monitors worried that rigging in certain Local </p><p>Government Areas (LGAs) (specifically, Kwande, </p><p>Katsina-Ala, Tarka and Gboko) would spark violence. </p><p>Both Nigerian and international election monitors </p><p>worried that the governing Peoples Democratic Party </p><p>(PDP) would attempt to manipulate the vote in the ANPP </p><p>or UNPP strongholds within the state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Conversations with Tiv, Jukun and Idoma </p><p>politicians, election monitors, and academics revealed </p><p>that President Obasanjo remains unpopular among the </p><p>populous Tiv because of the October 2001 Zaki-Biam </p><p>massacre.  The Tiv blame Minister of Defense T.Y. </p><p>Danjuma, a Jukun, for Zaki-Biam.  By extension, they </p><p>blame Obasanjo.  The comment "a vote for Obasanjo is a </p><p>vote for Danjuma" was made often.  Former Chief of </p><p>Defense Staff Gen. (Ret.) Victor Malu, whose home was </p><p>burned and relatives killed during the violence at </p><p>Zaki-Biam, been campaigning against Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Although from a different ethnic group in </p><p>another state, Vice President Atiku was given an </p><p>important traditional honorary title by the Tiv and </p><p>enjoys wide popularity, however, his positive standing </p><p>is insufficient to diminish Tiv anger.  While Obasanjo </p><p>may yet win in Benue, he cannot count on a large </p><p>margin.  He will have to win significant Tiv votes, </p><p>then count on the Jukun and Idoma to carry him.  With </p><p>PDP National Chairman Audu Ogbeh being Idoma, Obasanjo </p><p>will count on strong support from that quarter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) On the other hand, ANPP Presidential candidate </p><p>Muhammadu Buhari has encountered some friction from </p><p>the prickly Tivs.  When he attempted to campaign in </p><p>Benue a few months ago, some Tiv leaders cautioned him </p><p>to bypass the state.  They said many Tivs were angered </p><p>when stones were thrown at Vice President Atiku\'s </p><p>motorcade at an event in Kano late last year.  They </p><p>blamed Buhari supporters for Atiku\'s rough treatment </p><p>and warned Buhari might get similar treatment if he </p><p>came to Benue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The gubernatorial race features the incumbent </p><p>George Akume (PDP) and challengers Paul Urongo (ANPP) </p><p>and Mike Mku (UNPP).  Despite his recent illness and </p><p>convalescence in Europe, Akume is likely to hang on to </p><p>his position in a close race with Urongo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT: The problems INEC faces in Benue are </p><p>not unique.  Few outside INEC\'s own offices believe </p><p>its administrators and its newly trained poll workers </p><p>are prepared for the elections.  Obasanjo will be in a </p><p>competitive battle with Buhari to capture this </p><p>populous state.  Obasanjo will hope that the </p><p>antagonistic Tiv will stay home rather than vote for </p><p>Buhari.  If so, Obasanjo\'s assured support among the </p><p>Idoma and Jukun should write his ticket.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
