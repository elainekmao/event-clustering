<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 07 MAPUTO 001007 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/FO, AF/S, AF/RSA </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EAID, EINV, MZ, HIV/AIDS/PEPFAR </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S END-OF-TOUR REPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Sharon P. Wilkinson, for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary. Bilateral political and economic relations </p><p>between the U.S. and Mozambique have improved and deepened. </p><p>At a political level, bilateral cooperation is excellent, </p><p>with Washington acknowledging the impressive transition to </p><p>democracy and the GRM willing to cooperate with the U.S., for </p><p>example on Article 98. The Mozambican profile will rise with </p><p>the assumption of the AU Presidency in July. On the economic </p><p>front, Mozambique is one of the continent\'s best performers, </p><p>albeit from a low base, with the U.S. now poised to take a </p><p>larger role in trade and investment. The recent "B" </p><p>sovereign credit rating and OPIC engagement enhance the </p><p>potential. The country remains dependent on donor support, </p><p>where the U.S. takes a leading role. Reduction of absolute </p><p>poverty is the priority, and our efforts are focused on </p><p>economic growth, limiting the effects of HIV/AIDS and other </p><p>diseases, and strengthening governance. The U.S. has also </p><p>successfully led the effort to address the landmine problem. </p><p>Corruption is one of the greatest threats to continued </p><p>progress on the economic and political fronts. The GRM has </p><p>taken encouraging action to address the problem, and the U.S. </p><p>actively supports these efforts with inter-agency assistance. </p><p>Key areas where we need to maintain focus are corruption, </p><p>HIV/AIDS, further consolidation of democracy, education and </p><p>counter terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary continued. 2003 municipal and 2004 national </p><p>elections when President Chissano will step down will change </p><p>the political landscape. RENAMO will have at least moderate </p><p>success in the municipal elections, assuming governing </p><p>responsibilities for the first time; the party is not well </p><p>prepared for this eventuality. The 2004 races are too </p><p>distant to predict, however, both Presidential candidates </p><p>face significant hurdles. FRELIMO candidate Armando Guebuza </p><p>has credible experience, but must address negative public </p><p>association in the perceptions of past corruption and tough </p><p>policies during the Samora Machel administration. Voters may </p><p>also make the emotional decision that after 30 years of </p><p>FRELIMO rule, it is time for a change. The perennial </p><p>opposition leader and Presidential candidate, RENAMO Afonso </p><p>Dhlakama, lacks credibility, experience, and financing. </p><p>Likely third-party candidate Raul Domingos will not win but </p><p>could be the swing vote. Regardless of the outcome, the U.S. </p><p>will have no difficulty in maintaining the positive </p><p>engagement with the government and people of Mozambique that </p><p>we have enjoyed to date. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL RELATIONS </p><p>=================== </p><p>3. (U) Political relations between the U.S. and Mozambique </p><p>improved and deepened over the last three years. The U.S. </p><p>has appropriately acknowledged President Chissano\'s vision </p><p>and personal efforts which have been instrumental in the </p><p>transition to a stable multi-party, free-market oriented </p><p>democracy. The GRM greatly values this recognition and </p><p>high-level attention from Washington, including last year\'s </p><p>Southern African Mini Summit and President Bush\'s </p><p>participation with President Chissano in last month\'s </p><p>Corporate Council on Africa Washington Summit. Examples of </p><p>the GRM\'s commitment to our bilateral relationship include </p><p>our recent conclusion of an Article 98 Agreement and GRM </p><p>ratification of all 12 UN counter-terrorism conventions. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) On the regional stage, Mozambique has played an </p><p>increasingly visible role. Maputo has just successfully </p><p>hosted the second African Union (AU) Summit and President </p><p>Chissano assumed the AU Presidency for the next year. We </p><p>expect the GRM to expand on the active role played during its </p><p>chairmanship of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defense and </p><p>Security, where Chissano and FM Simao placed Mozambique at </p><p>the center of diplomatic efforts in Zimbabwe, Burundi, DROC, </p><p>and the Comoros. The AU Presidency will be an ideal forum </p><p>for President Chissano to bolster his already high stature as </p><p>one of the continent\'s elder statesman, before retiring from </p><p>office in 2004. We expect Chissano will be a forceful </p><p>advocate for NEPAD with its inherent focus on good </p><p>governance, peer review, and African solutions for African </p><p>problems. He is unlikely to speak out publicly against </p><p>President Mugabe\'s policies, leaving that to President Mbeki </p><p>and President Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND INVESTMENT </p><p>=================================== </p><p>5. (U) The economy grew at 8 percent in 2002 and is poised </p><p>to remain between seven and ten percent over the next few </p><p>years. Inflation fell from over 20 percent in 2001 to nine </p><p>percent in 2003 due to a tightening of monetary policy and </p><p>the gradual recovery from the devastating 2000 floods. This </p><p>growth, the result of sustained reforms and sound </p><p>macroeconomic management, as mandated by the IMF and World </p><p>Bank, have made Mozambique a viable destination for foreign </p><p>direct investment (FDI), particularly in sectors exploiting </p><p>the country\'s vast but largely untapped natural resources. </p><p>Confirmation of this positive picture is the "B/B " credit </p><p>rating assigned to Mozambique by Fitch Ratings in July 2003 </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Mozambique receives substantial FDI, but, so far, </p><p>the U.S. has not been one of the major players. (By 2001 </p><p>revenues, Mobil Oil is the 12th largest firm in country, </p><p>Coca-Cola 13th, with four others in the top 100.) This </p><p>situation is set to change. OPIC is providing nearly $30 </p><p>million for a U.S.-led consortium rehabilitation of the port </p><p>and rail facilities and acquisition of the concessions to run </p><p>the operations in the Nacala Corridor, a crucial </p><p>transportation route linking Northern Mozambique, Malawi, and </p><p>Zambia. The efficient operation of the route should engender </p><p>substantial investments in areas such as mining and </p><p>agriculture. OPIC is also involved in a major eco-tourism </p><p>project; eco-tourism is an industry set to boom in Mozambique </p><p>and it is a USAID focus area for export-led growth and job </p><p>creation. A U.S. construction firm has been contracted to </p><p>build a $200million mineral sands project in Nampula </p><p>province and a U.S./Norwegian partnership just signed an </p><p>agreement to prospect for natural gas in Sofala province. </p><p>Several other U.S. investments are also in the pipeline. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Mozambique has had moderate success in taking </p><p>advantage of AGOA. In 2002, 750,000 garments were exported, </p><p>up from a base of none the year before. Last month, the </p><p>first-ever exports of top-quality Mozambican prawns arrived </p><p>in the U.S. We recently learned of new legislative </p><p>initiatives to remove import duties for certain categories of </p><p>components for products made in Mozambique. </p><p> </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AND DONOR PARTNERS </p><p>========================================= </p><p>8. (U) Donor partners fund approximately 60 percent of the </p><p>national budget through either direct budget support or </p><p>through programs and projects designed to supplement </p><p>GRM-provided services. About 23 bilateral donors and a </p><p>string of smaller partners contribute to the disbursed aid </p><p>funds. In addition, 25 multilateral agencies and up to 150 </p><p>international NGOs/PVOs offer grants, loans, or technical </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) USAID and the other donor partners do not operate in </p><p>a vacuum in Mozambique. There is a clear trend among donors </p><p>in Mozambique to move toward harmonized forms of aid, whether </p><p>through budget support or through pooling and sector-wide </p><p>approaches. Donor funding for 2002 included budget support </p><p>($100 million); sector and pooled support ($100 million) and </p><p>other projects ($500 million). Apart from pooling funding </p><p>and technical assistance, organized dialogue between donors </p><p>and between government and donors illustrates another form of </p><p>harmonization and coordination. USAID is an integral part of </p><p>this process. With our donor partners, we are encouraging a </p><p>greater focus on corruption, and support for conditionality </p><p>of assistance in return for policy reform. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) As the role of USAID has expanded over the last </p><p>nearly 20 years, our strategies have been fine-tuned. </p><p>USAID\'s Country Strategic Plan from 1996 to present focused </p><p>on increasing rural incomes, making government accountable to </p><p>citizens, improving health, and creating a better business </p><p>environment. The new strategic plan for 2004-2010 will build </p><p>on this experience to create broad-based, rapid economic </p><p>growth sustained through expanded capacities and </p><p>opportunities. The five strategic objects that will be </p><p>utilized to achieve this are increasing rural economic </p><p>growth, focusing on labor intensive exports, helping local </p><p>government become more democratic, improving health services </p><p>for children and reproductive health, and finally working </p><p>towards behavior changes which will result in preventing new </p><p>cases of HIV/AIDS while also caring for those already </p><p>suffering from this disease. With this central and strategic </p><p>objectives in mind, USAID stays true to its support of the </p><p>GRM PARPA (Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty) </p><p>as each objective contributes to at least one of the PARPA\'s </p><p>priorities. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The GRM is, of course, anxiously awaiting </p><p>appropriation of the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) </p><p>funds. We fully expect Mozambique to qualify; failure to do </p><p>so would be a major blow, given the country\'s impressive and </p><p>sustained policy strides of the last ten years. </p><p> </p><p>HIV/AIDS AND HEALTH </p><p>=================== </p><p>12. (SBU) The Mozambican Government has been an outspoken </p><p>advocate in the battle against HIV/AIDS, led by Prime </p><p>Minister Mocumbi who heads the National AIDS Council. </p><p>(Comment. A European trained physician, Mocumbi last year </p><p>ran a strong but ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the </p><p>World Health Organization Director Generalship. It is an </p><p>open secret that Mocumbi, at ease in the international arena, </p><p>is interested in exploring outside job possibilities and </p><p>could well end up elsewhere in the international health </p><p>field. End Comment.) The GRM is committed to forceful </p><p>action and outspoken advocacy as essential to contain and </p><p>diminish the infection rate, which is currently 12 percent. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) The U.S. is actively engaged in the health sector, </p><p>both through growing USG programs as well as private </p><p>organizations, including the Gates Foundation, Clinton </p><p>Foundation, and numerous NGOs. USAID direct assistance has </p><p>provided technical assistance, training, and commodities to </p><p>improve the public health system and enable key Mozambican </p><p>organizations to lead HIV/AIDS prevention. This assistance </p><p>has been successful in shifting health service delivery from </p><p>international to local institutions, including a revitalized </p><p>Ministry of Health (MOH). Similarly, CDC has enjoyed success </p><p>in its dealings with the MOH in the implementation of </p><p>surveillance of HIV, voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), </p><p>and planning, monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS </p><p>activities. In calendar year 2004, the CDC Global AIDS </p><p>Program (GAP) will begin support to the MOH in the </p><p>implementation of prevention of mother-to-child transmission </p><p>activities, including the treatment of AIDS patients. The </p><p>Department of Labor is funding $900,000 to address HIV/AIDS </p><p>in the workplace and Peace Corps works actively in HIV </p><p>prevention through classroom instruction and other outreach </p><p>programs. In calendar year 2004 they will welcome the first </p><p>group of volunteers in the health sector. For all the </p><p>efforts and success needs remain high and Mozambique is </p><p>poised and eager to participate in President Bush\'s $15 </p><p>million Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. </p><p> </p><p>DEMINING </p><p>======== </p><p>14. (U) Landmines, both from the colonial struggle and the </p><p>civil war, have taken an enormous toll on Mozambique, both </p><p>economically and socially. The USG, first through DOD ($11.5 </p><p>million) and for the last 3-4 years primarily through PM/HDP </p><p>($10.5 million), has been one of the leading donors helping </p><p>the GRM to demine. We have supported numerous demining </p><p>projects implemented by RONCO, based in Beira, Sofala </p><p>province. Support has also included capacity-building of the </p><p>National Demining Institute (IND) and the Mozambican Armed </p><p>Forces (FADM) Demining Brigade in the form of training and </p><p>equipment. This year, at the request of the GRM, RONCO </p><p>completed demining the Sena rail line, a once flourishing </p><p>transportation route linking Dondo (near Beira port) to the </p><p>Malawi border, which now can be refurbished. This year our </p><p>focus shifted from the central provinces to the north, with </p><p>$2.5 million in PM/HDP funds going to clear Portuguese-laid </p><p>minefields along the border with Tanzania. After more than </p><p>ten years of effort, Mozambique is approaching, but not yet </p><p>at, the point where the high-impact mine problem will have </p><p>been sufficiently overcome. Though we expect funding levels </p><p>for Mozambican demining to decrease due to the obvious need </p><p>to deal with new mine hotspots like Afghanistan, Iraq and </p><p>Angola, we need to stay the course to ensure the completion </p><p>of this task, essential for Mozambican development. </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) We are particularly pleased with the work of the </p><p>Department of State-funded Quick Reaction Demining Force </p><p>(QRDF), also operated by RONCO; we have worked actively to </p><p>publicize its successes. QRDF teams, with virtually all </p><p>Mozambican deminers, have been successfully deployed to </p><p>Sudan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and, now, Iraq. While not </p><p>deployed, QRDF teams have completed high-priority tasks </p><p>inside Mozambique, such as recent power line demining work </p><p>that was requested by the Governor of Sofala province. The </p><p>effectiveness of the Mozambican teams in challenging </p><p>international environments is on source of pride for </p><p>Mozambique and an example of our bilateral cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORTS </p><p>======================= </p><p>16. (SBU) Corruption is pervasive in Mozambique. It not </p><p>only hampers development of trade and investment, but has a </p><p>nexus with money-laundering and trafficking in narcotics and </p><p>persons. A 2001 survey, funded by USAID and carried out by </p><p>the local civil society organization, ETICA, showed that 66 </p><p>percent of respondents had paid or been solicited for a bribe </p><p>by a public official in the prior six-month period. This </p><p>had never been done before in Mozambique, and was a useful </p><p>tool for opening public discussion of corruption. Conflicts </p><p>of interest for senior public officials are common, where </p><p>they use public office to benefit private business interests. </p><p>Prosecutions for corruption-related offenses are still rare. </p><p>The assassinations of investigative journalist Carlos </p><p>Cardoso and bank official Antonio Siba-Siba Macuacua, both </p><p>linked to corruption at failed banks in which the government </p><p>exercised significant control, have galvanized public opinion </p><p>against corruption. </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) The appointment of a new Attorney General, Joaquim </p><p>Madeira, a former Supreme Court Justice, signaled a </p><p>noticeably stronger official stance against corruption. </p><p>Madeira shocked the political establishment in his 2001 </p><p>parliamentary address, promising to take strong action </p><p>against corruption. He fired members of his own staff, </p><p>forced the removal of judges, and created a specialized </p><p>anti-corruption unit to pursue corruption cases. With USAID, </p><p>INL and other funding, we have actively supported this unit, </p><p>renovating offices, donating equipment, and providing </p><p>extensive training, FBI courses and OPDAT advisor visits. </p><p>This unit is an increasingly important anti-corruption </p><p>player. Its resources are dwarfed by the scale of the </p><p>problem, and we plan continued and expanded support for it. </p><p>In addition to the work with the anti-corruption unit, we </p><p>have built a constructive relationship with the National </p><p>Police Academy (ACIPOL), supported by INL funds, where we </p><p>expect that enhancing law enforcement capacity, beginning </p><p>with fresh recruits, will in the long run strengthen </p><p>anti-corruption efforts. A measure of success is the request </p><p>for training from the Director of Customs, one of the most </p><p>corrupt organizations in Mozambique. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) The highly publicized Cardoso trial, which many </p><p>thought would never happen, was a watershed in the fight </p><p>against corruption, but it was only an initial step. Those </p><p>implicated in ordering the assassination, including President </p><p>Chissano\'s son, have yet to be brought to justice. Other </p><p>high-profile cases are also pending. Perception of </p><p>widespread corruption among the political elite in Maputo is </p><p>one of the areas where FRELIMO is most vulnerable heading </p><p>into upcoming elections. RENAMO and the smaller opposition </p><p>parties harp constantly on corruption, but many sanguine </p><p>observers believe that, if in power, RENAMO would also be </p><p>plagued by corruption. </p><p> </p><p>THE POLITICAL FUTURE </p><p>==================== </p><p>19. (C) Municipal elections, scheduled to be held in </p><p>November 2003, will mark a new phase in Mozambican democracy </p><p>when, for the first time, some RENAMO candidates should find </p><p>themselves in governance positions. No scientific polling </p><p>exists in Mozambique, but based on our own up-country travel </p><p>and 1999 election results, we expect RENAMO to win </p><p>approximately 15 of the 33 races. FRELIMO should retain all </p><p>10 municipalities in the three southern provinces and most in </p><p>the traditional northern strongholds of Cabo Delgado as well </p><p>as Niassa. However, RENAMO should have a strong showing in </p><p>the central provinces of Sofala, Manica, Zambezia, and Tete, </p><p>as well as the five municipalities in Nampula. Though </p><p>municipalities do not yet play a large political or economic </p><p>role in a still very centralized Mozambique, RENAMO gaining </p><p>at least some power will have the symbolic importance of </p><p>shattering the myth of FRELIMO invincibility. </p><p>20. (C) To some extent, the municipal election outcomes </p><p>will be harbingers of the December 2004 national elections. </p><p>While we believe the 2004 elections are FRELIMO\'s to lose, we </p><p>are not yet ready to call the winner. With only one year </p><p>between the contests, a particularly strong showing by RENAMO </p><p>in the municipal contests, perhaps a better than expected </p><p>showing in the north and central and/or a win in a </p><p>traditionally FRELIMO stronghold in the south, would be a </p><p>strong indicator of Mozambicans\' desire for change at a </p><p>national level. Conversely, FRELIMO holding RENAMO to ten or </p><p>fewer municipalities in their traditional central strongholds </p><p>would bode well for FRELIMO\'s chances in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>PARTY LEADERSHIP </p><p>================ </p><p>21. (C) FRELIMO Secretary General and Presidential </p><p>candidate Armando Guebuza is known as a decisive, capable </p><p>leader. He has impressive government credentials as a former </p><p>Minister of Interior, Minister of Transportation, and </p><p>parliamentary leader. He has been one of FRELIMO\'s most </p><p>forceful backers of free market structural reforms and in the </p><p>90s became one of the country\'s wealthiest and most </p><p>successful businessmen. However, Guebuza faces several </p><p>electoral challenges. Foremost are the rumors of corruption, </p><p>both from shenanigans during the privatization of government </p><p>companies as well alleged involvement in other illicit </p><p>activities. We expect Guebuza will make cracking down on </p><p>corruption a top campaign priority to counter this image. He </p><p>has already given indications of this in public and private </p><p>gatherings. Though engaging on a personal level, Guebuza is </p><p>less charismatic than Chissano. Also, regional equities may </p><p>work against him. Though born in Nampula to a northern Makua </p><p>mother, Guebuza is much more closely associated with the </p><p>south, having a southern father and having been raised in </p><p>Maputo. The perception in the central and northern regions </p><p>is that the south has received the lion\'s share of </p><p>development resources, and another southerner (like Chissano </p><p>and Machel) would only continue this pattern. </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) RENAMO leader Afonso Dhlakama also faces </p><p>challenges. First, there is a credibility issue, as both he </p><p>and his party lack any governing experience. Also, RENAMO </p><p>lacks the financial resources to wage an effective campaign. </p><p>FRELIMO controls the government apparatus and patronage which </p><p>it will fully use to its advantage. RENAMO has yet to </p><p>articulate an election strategy or platform. After more than </p><p>ten years in Maputo, Dhlakama has earned an image of </p><p>perennial opposition leader, living the life of leisure in </p><p>Maputo, increasingly out of touch with his rural base in the </p><p>central region. Nevertheless, he has enormous name </p><p>recognition and will draw support not only from diehard </p><p>RENAMO backers, but also from disenchanted FRELIMO members </p><p>and, potentially, new voters. </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) A huge unknown for the 2004 presidential and </p><p>legislative contest is what role former RENAMO number two </p><p>Raul Domingos will play. Domingos, on track with what he has </p><p>told us over the last year, is on his way to forming his own </p><p>political party. Still a member of the National Assembly, </p><p>Domingos remains in the public spotlight, and he has been </p><p>traveling extensively throughout the country. Based on our </p><p>travels, the presence of the NGO Domingos founded, IPADE, </p><p>particularly in Tete and Manica provinces, has been notable. </p><p>However, IPADE is very weak or non-existent in other parts of </p><p>the country. How much support Domingos and his party would </p><p>have at a national level is unclear, but we do not seeing him </p><p>getting more than 5-10 percent of the vote. A Domingos </p><p>candidacy is likely to play a spoiler function. Though </p><p>Domingos could conceivably take some votes from FRELIMO </p><p>members unhappy with corruption and other problems, Dhlakama </p><p>is the more likely victim of a Domingos run. Dhlakama\'s </p><p>autocratic style and perceived distancing from his rural, </p><p>grassroots support could cost him votes. Also, an ethnic </p><p>split is conceivable, with Senas abandoning Ndau Dhlakama for </p><p>fellow Sena Domingos. The source of Domingos\' funding, for </p><p>IPADE and his future party, is unclear. RENAMO leadership </p><p>and media outlets have insinuated that FRELIMO is backing </p><p>Domingos in order to split the opposition, a charge not </p><p>without some plausibility. </p><p> </p><p>PLAYERS IN A GUEBUZA OR DHLAKAMA ADMINISTRATION </p><p>============================================= == </p><p>24. (C) Regardless of who wins in 2004, most of the </p><p>interlocutors Washington and the Mission have come to know </p><p>well will change. Under Guebuza, we would expect to see most </p><p>Chissano-appointed ministers gone, certainly Prime Minister </p><p>Mocumbi, Foreign Minister Simao, Finance Minister Diogo, </p><p>Transport Minister Salomao, Health Minister Songane and </p><p>Agriculture Minister Muteia, and possibly Industry and </p><p>Commerce Minister Morgado. Possible holdovers are Mineral </p><p>Resources and Energy Minister Langa and Defense Minister Dai, </p><p>Guebuza\'s brother-in-law, though with different portfolios. </p><p>Prominent governors from Sofala, Nampula, and Cabo Delgado </p><p>could also turn up as ministers. </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) Though they are unlikely to take a cabinet or </p><p>otherwise public position, influential FRELIMO members will </p><p>continue to play crucial policy roles behind the scenes. </p><p>First on this list is President Chissano, who will remain </p><p>head of FRELIMO. Other major players in FRELIMO\'s central </p><p>committee, including Alberto Chipande and Rafael Maguni </p><p>(respectively Ministers of Defense and Information under </p><p>Samora Machel), will likewise continue behind the scenes. </p><p>Another major player, and a potential 2009 Presidential </p><p>candidate, is Graca Machel, Samora Machel\'s widow and the </p><p>current wife of Nelson Mandela. </p><p> </p><p>26. (C) A Dhlakama victory would bring many challenges for </p><p>RENAMO. One of the first would be coming up with capable, if </p><p>not experienced, personalities for key positions. Dhlakama\'s </p><p>autocratic style has driven out major players such as </p><p>Domingos and former RENAMO Secretary General Joaquim Vaz. </p><p>Dhlakama has continually given us the encouraging message </p><p>that technocratic-level public workers would be retained. </p><p>But the sheer number of political-level appointments required </p><p>- Minister, Vice Minister, National Directors at 22 </p><p>ministries, governors, and Ambassadors - dwarfs such </p><p>assurances. In their meeting following his May 2003 U.S. </p><p>visit, Dhlakama told the Ambassador that a committee of 44 </p><p>individuals already existed, drawn from business and </p><p>academia. Presumably, political appointees would be drawn </p><p>from this group. RENAMO\'s relationship with its Electoral </p><p>Union (UE) coalition partners remains fractious. However, </p><p>ultimately we would expect to see small party leaders, many </p><p>of whom provide the intellectual backbone of the opposition, </p><p>take on important portfolios. Attorney Maximo Dias of MONAMO </p><p>and engineer Lutero Simango of PCN fall into this category. </p><p>We would expect no current FRELIMO ministers to participate </p><p>in a Dhlakama administration in any way. </p><p> </p><p>27. (C) Should RENAMO win in 2004, an orderly political </p><p>transition would demonstrate the solidity of Mozambican </p><p>democracy, specifically FRELIMO\'s commitment to it. A </p><p>graceful loss would confirm its own self-proclaimed </p><p>commitment to democracy and peace. While a RENAMO win might </p><p>be a good democracy story, it would certainly make for </p><p>difficult times in Mozambique. On policy, RENAMO would </p><p>likely continue the positive reforms of FRELIMO and perhaps </p><p>move closer to U.S. position in other areas (e.g., allowing </p><p>land ownership, support for the U.S. in Iraq, a harder line </p><p>on Mugabe, etc.). However, the expected disarray of a </p><p>Dhlakama administration, at least initially, would require </p><p>not only patience but significant additional support. </p><p>Implementation of our myriad assistance programs would be </p><p>extremely challenging, especially if FRELIMO-aligned </p><p>technocrats were replaced with less experienced or </p><p>unqualified RENAMO functionaries. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT THE USG SHOULD FOCUS ON </p><p>============================ </p><p>28. (U) The FY-05 MPP lays out the Mission\'s overall key </p><p>objectives. There are several areas in particular the USG </p><p>should concentrate its efforts. One is elevating the policy </p><p>dialogue on corruption. Failure to win this battle could </p><p>derail all the other important economic reforms Mozambique </p><p>has implemented, and reduce foreign investment incentives </p><p>needed to generate economic growth. For significant poverty </p><p>reduction, Mozambique must reduce red tape and other </p><p>barriers. Continued USG support for the HIV/AIDS battle is </p><p>crucial to staunch, then reverse, the ravages of the </p><p>pandemic. Finally, though Mozambique has been a model for </p><p>the transition to democracy, we should not lose sight of just </p><p>how young the democracy is. Beyond just election monitoring, </p><p>we should continue efforts to consolidate the gains made. A </p><p>foreseeable need is governance training for new RENAMO </p><p>leaders. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON IF WE HAD EXTRA $$$ </p><p>=========================================== </p><p>29. (C) Needs in Mozambique are enormous, but there are two </p><p>areas where additional resources could mostly usefully be </p><p>applied. The first area is counter-terrorism. The GRM is </p><p>fully cooperative at the political level, and the Mission </p><p>actively engages with police, military, banking, and </p><p>diplomatic contacts. We fully participate in training </p><p>opportunities such as ILEA. However, major resources are </p><p>needed to help the GRM address the many weaknesses that </p><p>include a large Muslim population that is extremely poor and </p><p>vulnerable to outside influence, notoriously porous borders </p><p>with all its neighbors, a 1500-mile unpatrolled coastline for </p><p>which the GRM has zero monitoring capacity, and a severely </p><p>limited response ability in the event of a terrorist attack. </p><p>The GRM\'s heavy dependence upon South Africa and the Indian </p><p>navy for security during the AU Summit bore witness to these </p><p>weaknesses. </p><p> </p><p>30. (U) The second is education, which, though part of </p><p>Peace Corps\' stock and trade, has not been a major focus of </p><p>the USG. The lack of human capacity is a serious limiting </p><p>factor we consistently encounter in all sectors. Many </p><p>Mozambicans, in and out of government, are well-trained, </p><p>English-speaking and competent, but that expertise is </p><p>extremely thin. While we have successfully cultivated </p><p>Mozambican institutions of higher education through linkages, </p><p>Fulbright, etc., there remain innumerable opportunities for </p><p>meaningful assistance in secondary and university education, </p><p>in addition to girls\' education at the primary level. </p><p>WILKINSON </p><p></p></div>
