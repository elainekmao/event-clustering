<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KAMPALA 02314 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL PINS PNAT PTER PGOV EPET PLO UG WI LY IR XA SX </p><p>SUBJECT:  MUSEVENI AND THE RADICAL MUSLIMS. </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -  ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  UGANDA\'S RELATIONS WITH LIBYA CONTINUE TO </p><p>INTENSIFY.  PRESIDENT MUSEVENI HAS MET WITH DELEGATIONS FROM </p><p>THE PLO AND SAHARAN ARAB DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC (SADR); GOU </p><p>HAS NORMALIZED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE LATTER </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  NRM HAS ALSO RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO </p><p>FEELERS FOR IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH IRAN.  THIS RAPPRO- </p><p>CHEMENT WITH RADICAL MUSLIM STATES --AND IT IS A </p><p>RAPPROCHEMENT SINCE MOST ENJOYED GOOD RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THE AMIN GOVERNMENT-- STEMS FROM AN NRM PERCEPTION THAT </p><p>IT WILL ENHANCE ITS ATTRACTIVENESS TO POTENTIAL MUSLIM </p><p>DONORS AND A FUNDAMENTAL IDENTITY OF VIEWS ON SELF- </p><p>DETERMINATION FOR THE PALESTINIANS AND BLACK SOUTH </p><p>AFRICANS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE PACE OF LIBYAN-UGANDAN RELATIONS IS INTENSIFYING. </p><p>IN RECENT MONTHS THE LIBYANS HAVE SENT A TRADE DELEGATION, </p><p>A FINANCIAL TEAM AND MEDICAL TEAM.  GOU HAS ANNOUNCED THAT </p><p>MUSEVENI HAS HELD TALKS WITH A DOCTOR MUKHTAR ALI ON THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF SETTING UP A JOINT HOLDING COMPANY TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH THE UGANDA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION.  THE </p><p>GOU HAS ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>OF CREATING AN OIL COMPANY IN COOPERATION WITH THE GOL. </p><p>ON JULY 4,THE GOU ACKNOWLEDGED IT WAS RECEIVING DONATED </p><p>DRUGS FROM THE GOL. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE LIBYAN PEOPLES BUREAU HAS EXPANDED IN SIZE </p><p>TO SIX , AND THE STAFF HAVE ADOPTED A HIGHER PROFILE ROLE </p><p>IN KAMPALA.  THE LIBYANS ARE LIKELY TO SOON RAISE RELATIONS </p><p>TO THE AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL (SINCE THE 1979 WAR AGAINST AMIN </p><p>THE LIBYAN MISSION HAS BEEN HEADED BY A CHARGE). </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  THE HOLDING COMPANY AND OIL COMPANY WILL </p><p>ALLOW THE LIBYANS TO ENLARGE THEIR COMMUNITY, SOMETHING </p><p>THEY WERE UNABLE TO DO DURING THE OBOTE/OKELLO PERIOD. </p><p>THE UGANDANS PROBABLY BELIEVE SINCERELY-- ALBEIT NAIVELY-- </p><p>THAT THEY CAN GENUINELY BENEFIT FROM LIBYAN LARGESSE AND </p><p>STILL RETAIN CONTROL OF THE RELATIONSHIP.  THE OIL COMPANY </p><p>IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE AND FITS NICELY WITH NRM ECONO- </p><p>MIC PLANNING.  AS A LANDLOCKED COUNTRY, TOTALLY DEPENDENT </p><p>ON IMPORTED POL, UGANDA HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>ITS VULNERABILITY TO BEING CUT OFF FROM POL SUPPLIES. </p><p>TRADITIONALLY THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN TO </p><p>TREAT THE PRIVATE OIL COMPANIES VERY WELL BY THIRD WORLD </p><p>STANDARDS.  THEY WERE ALLOWED TO BE PROFITABLE AND INDEPEN- </p><p>DENT IN RETURN FOR GUARANTEEING UGANDA\'S SUPPLY OF POL. </p><p>THE NRM DISTRUSTS THE TRADITIONAL MODUS OPERANDI AND IS </p><p>IDEOLOGICALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS PERCEIVED AS </p><p>VULNERABILITY TO MULTINATIONAL CAPITALISM.  THE GOU WOULD </p><p>LIKE LIBYAN ASSISTANCE TO SET UP A GOU CONTROLLED OIL </p><p>COMPANY TO GUARANTEE ITS SECURITY OF SUPPLY, MUCH AS IT </p><p>HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PURCHASING A SHARE OF THE </p><p>MOMBASA REFINERY FROM GOK FOR SIMILAR REASONS.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO AN OIL COMPANY SOURCE IN KAMPALA, THE PROPOSED COMPANY </p><p>IS LIKELY TO BE A PARASTATAL OIL PROCUREMENT COMPANY OF </p><p>THE TYPE COMMON IN AFRICA.  IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR </p><p>SUCH A COMPANY TO BE PROFITABLE, ACCORDING TO SOURCE, UNLESS </p><p>THE LIBYANS PROVIDE A MASSIVE SUBSIDY EITHER IN THE FORM OF </p><p>ESSENTIALLY FREE OIL, OR MONETARY EQUIVALENT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MUSEVENI HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED A PLO DELEGATION.  THIS </p><p>IS PROBABLY A UNILATERAL INITIATIVE ON THE PART OF PLO TO </p><p>REESTABLISH THE FAVORABLE POSITION IT HELD UNDER THE AMIN </p><p>REGIME WHEN THE PLO OPERATED A FARM AND TRAINING CAMPS IN </p><p>UGANDA.  COMMENT:  THIS IS NOT A SURPRISING DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>FROM DAY ONE OF THE MUSEVENI GOVERNMENT THE PRESIDENT HAS </p><p>MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE WILL TREAT WITH NEITHER THE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN OR ISRAELI GOVERNMENTS; HIS SYMPATHIES ARE CLEARLY </p><p>WITH THE PALESTINIANS, WHO HE FEELS HAVE BEEN EVICTED FROM </p><p>THEIR HOMELAND BY ISRAELI MILITARY MIGHT.  HE BELIEVES THE </p><p>PLO IS JUSTIFIED IN FIGHTING FOR ITS RIGHTS, BUT FIRMLY </p><p>DRAWS THE LINE AGAINST THE USE OF TERRORIST TACTICS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY ATTACKS AGAINST CIVILIANS WHETHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE </p><p>OF ISRAEL.  HE POINTS WITH PRIDE TO THE FACT HE NEVER RESORTED </p><p>TO TERRORISM DURING HIS FIVE YEAR STRUGGLE.  BY ALLOWING THE </p><p>PLO TO REESTABLISH ITS PRESENCE IN UGANDA, HE SIMPLY REJOINS </p><p>THE RANKS OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF AFRICAN STATES.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  MUSEVENI RECENTLY RECEIVED A DELEGATION FROM THE SAHARAN </p><p>ARAB DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC (SADR) AND ISSUED A PUBLIC STATE- </p><p>MENT INDICATING THAT HE WOULD ESTABLISH RELATIONS IN </p><p>-ACCORDANCE WITH UGANDA\'S POLICIES OF MAINTAINING GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH ALL FRIENDLY COUNTRIES.  ACCORDING TO AN </p><p>EGYPTIAN SOURCE, THE MEETING RESULTED FROM AN INITIATIVE </p><p>BY THE ALGERIANS.  COMMENT:  THE ACT OF RECOGNIZING </p><p>THE SDAR IS MORE SIGNIFIC?NT THAN EMBRACING THE PLO, AS </p><p>BY SO DOING MUSEVENI HAS TAKEN SIDES ON AN ISSUE WHERE </p><p>THERE I? NO OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS IN AFRICAN AND ARAB </p><p>CIRCLES. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT AND CONCLUSION: </p><p> </p><p>SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT MUSEVENI\'S RAPPROCHEMENT WITH </p><p>THE RADICAL ARABS (AND PERHAPS PERSIANS) ARE IN ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>--  FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES AND </p><p>LIBERATION ORGANIZATIONS, MUSEVENI\'S EMBRACE REPRESENTS </p><p>THE REESTABLISHMENT OF A FORMER POSITION.  THE PLO AND </p><p>LIBYANS WERE REPRESENTED HERE AND WERE QUITE INFLUENTIAL </p><p>DURING THE AMIN YEARS.  INCIDENTALLY, THEY ARE NOT REMEM- </p><p>BERED FONDLY BY THE BULK OF UGANDANS. </p><p> </p><p>--  MUSEVENI IS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE WESTERN DONOR </p><p>RESPONSE TO HIS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE REQUEST OF DOLS </p><p>160 MILLION; TO DATE, LESS THAN DOLS 40 MILLION HAS BEEN </p><p>PLEDGED.  WHILE WE HAVE NO FIRM FIGURES, IF THE LIBYANS ARE </p><p>PLAYING TRUE TO FORM THEY PROBABLY ARE BRANDISHING ABOUT </p><p>RATHER SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS THAT, IF DELIVERED, WOULD MAKE </p><p>THEM THE MOST IMPORTANT BILATERAL DONOR ON THE LOCAL SCENE. </p><p> </p><p>--  THERE IS AN IDEOLOGICAL COMPONENT TO MUSEVENI\'S FAVORING </p><p>THE RADICAL MIDDLE-EASTERNERS; THEY ARE PERCEIVED AS BEING </p><p>TRULY NON-ALIGNED AND NOT DOMINATED BY EITHER WESTERN OR </p><p>EASTERN BLOCS.  THIS MAY BE NONSENSE, BUT THIRD WORLD </p><p>SOLIDARITY IS CLEARLY EMERGING AS A MAJOR THEME OF MUSEVENI\'S </p><p>IDEOLOGY.  MORE IMPORTANTLY THE ARAB\'S SHARE MUSEVENI\'S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO MAJORITY RULE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, AND HE </p><p>THEIRS OF SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE PALESTINIANS. </p><p> </p><p>--  INCIDENTALLY, THE STYLE OF ARAB RELATIONS IS WELL </p><p>SUITED TO THE MUSEVENI REGIME, WHICH IS HIGHLY PERSONAL </p><p>AND CENTERED AROUND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.  TO ARRANGE </p><p>LIBYAN ASSISTANCE MUSEVENI NEED ONLY TELEPHONE THE COLONEL, </p><p>NOT ENGAGE IN THE SLOW PERSUASION AND BUREAUCRATIC CONCENSUS </p><p>BUILDING NECESSARY FOR WESTERN ASSISTANCE. </p><p> </p><p>--  BY HOSTING AN EXPANDING RADICAL ARAB PRESENCE MUSEVENI </p><p>IS INVITING PROBLEMS WITH A HOST OF COUNTRIES WHO HAVE BEEN </p><p>VICTIMS OF LIBYAN-SUPPORTED SUBVERSION AND TERRORISM, </p><p>NOTABLY EGYPT, ZAIRE, KENYA AND THE WESTERN NATIONS.  WHILE </p><p>MUSEVENI HAS SAID HE HAS TOLD THE LIBYANS HE WOULD NOT </p><p>COUNTENANCE EXTRA-LEGAL ACTIONS ON UGANDAN TERRORITY, THE </p><p>LIBYANS INEVITABLY WILL CHEAT AND WILL CREATE PROBLEMS FOR </p><p>MUSEVENI WITH MOBUTU AND MOI. INTERNALLY, LIBYAN SUPPORT </p><p>FOR LOCAL MUSLIM GROUPS WILL CREATE PROBLEMS AS WELL, AND </p><p>WILL WORK AGAINST MUSEVENI\'S EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE SECTARIAN- </p><p>ISM AS A FACTOR IN LOCAL POLITICS. </p><p> </p><p>--  IN SUM, MUSEVENI IS GAMBLING THAT HE CAN STEER AND </p><p>CONTROL THE RELATIONSHIP; THAT HE CAN USE THE RADICALS </p><p>WITHOUT HIMSELF BEING VIOLATED.  THE REAL DANGER TO </p><p>AMERICANS IN UGANDA WILL COME WHEN THE LIKES OF THE LIBYANS </p><p>CONCLUDE THAT THE VALUE OF THE MUSEVENI RELATIONSHIP DOES </p><p>NOT OUTWEIGH THE OPPORTUNITY TO STRIKE LOCALLY AT U.S. </p><p>INTERESTS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOUDEK </p><p></p></div>
