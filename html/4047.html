<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 006154 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/14/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS: STATUS OF JSCR; MB DEMONSTRATION </p><p>TACTICS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 5838 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 5576 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION GREGORY L. BERRY.  REASONS:  1.5 </p><p> (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY  The President of the Jordanian Society for </p><p>Citizens\' Rights (JSCR) told us October 14 that despite the </p><p>recent reports of a GOJ "walkback" from its threat to close </p><p>the JSCR (reftel A), he remains concerned that the JSCR will </p><p>be rendered ineffective by a rumored new GOJ-appointed board </p><p>of directors.  In addition, he reported that the MB is </p><p>planning to organize anti-USG demonstrations outside of Amman </p><p>in areas where tribal influence is high in order to obviate a </p><p>potentially harsh GOJ response.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>THE FATE OF THE JSCR </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) JSCR President Fawzi Samhoury told PolOff October 14 </p><p>that, although the GOJ now states that the JSCR can remain </p><p>open if it complies with the law, he is still worried about </p><p>the final outcome of GOJ action.  Samhoury said there are </p><p>rumors that the JSCR will have to accept a new board </p><p>appointed by the GOJ, and is worried that such a move would </p><p>emasculate the JSCR.  "If they take away the independence of </p><p>my society, I will not participate in it anymore," he said. </p><p>Hinting that GOJ scrutiny of the JSCR was in retaliation for </p><p>his reporting on human rights, Samhoury said he recently met </p><p>with Dr. Khaled Tahayneh of the Foreign Ministry, who told </p><p>him that the GOJ is in particular upset that the USG\'s Human </p><p>Rights Report for 2001 contained information about </p><p>Palestinian-Jordanians who have lost their passports due to </p><p>implementation of disengagement laws.  "They know that I am </p><p>your source for this information," he said. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>MB ORGANIZING DEMONSTRATIONS OUTSIDE AMMAN </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Samhoury reported that the MB is planning to organize </p><p>anti-USG demonstrations outside of Amman, "where there are </p><p>fewer Palestinians and the tribal leaders have greater </p><p>control."  He said that the MB believes security forces will </p><p>be less likely to use excessive force against demonstrators </p><p>in tribal-controlled locations and thus people will be less </p><p>inhibited from demonstrating.  Samhoury reported that the </p><p>hawkish Ahmed Kawfahi of the MB gave a speech last Friday at </p><p>the local mosque in Tafileh in an attempt to organize a </p><p>future demonstration there.  When a local Ministry of </p><p>Religious Affairs-appointed Imam objected, Kawfahi physically </p><p>pushed him aside.  Samhoury said that the MB plans to hold </p><p>several demonstrations in small cities such as Tafileh, but </p><p>his sources had no further specifics. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  This was our first meeting with Samhoury since the </p><p>GOJ signaled that it may not, after all, dissolve the JSCR. </p><p>Samhoury is still patient, but is worried about the future of </p><p>the JSCR and the potential for it to be emasculated by a </p><p>rumored GOJ-appointed board of directors.  We have not heard </p><p>any indications from other sources that the GOJ is </p><p>considering such a move, but will closely monitor the </p><p>situation. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
