<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000533 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, PM/B, L </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL: 03-28-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KTIA, MV, External Relations, Maldives </p><p>SUBJECT:  Status of Maldivian non-surrender of nationals </p><p>agreement </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) SA/INS-Colombo 03/27/03 class e-mail </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 512, and previous </p><p>-      (C) State 74061 (all Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons: 1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Per Ref B and previous, Mission has been in </p><p>close and constant touch with the Maldivian government, </p><p>pressing it to sign the non-surrender of nationals </p><p>agreement as soon as possible.  The Maldivian MFA has </p><p>told us that the plan is to have Foreign Minister Jameel </p><p>sign it.  (Note:  The Maldivians have, so far, made it </p><p>very clear to us that they want Jameel to be the </p><p>principal who signs the document for their side.)  Once </p><p>that is done, the document would then be sent to Embassy </p><p>Colombo for signature by the Ambassador. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) We are not sure why the Maldivians are taking so </p><p>long to complete this process, since agreement on the </p><p>text was completed last week.  (Note:  Per Ref B, the </p><p>final text is that proposed by the Maldivians and </p><p>approved by Washington in Ref C.)  It is possible that </p><p>the war with Iraq has somehow affected Maldivian </p><p>thinking on this issue (although we do not think this is </p><p>the case).  It is also possible that there is </p><p>bureaucratic confusion leading to inertia in the </p><p>government (which is endemic in the GoRM), or that </p><p>Jameel is busy and just has not got around to signing </p><p>the document.  In any case, as noted, we are pressing </p><p>the Maldivians hard to wrap this up ASAP. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) That said, Mission has forwarded Ref A request </p><p>that the Maldivians sign the document during Ambassador </p><p>Lino\'s visit to New York next week.  The MFA is closed </p><p>today, as it is Friday (the start of the weekend in the </p><p>Maldives), and Mission has not received a response to </p><p>this request.  We suggest that Washington continue to </p><p>work this issue with the Maldivian Mission in New York. </p><p>We will continue to be in close contact with the MFA on </p><p>this important matter. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
