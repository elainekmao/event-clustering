(U) ON NOVEMBER 24, ZIMBABWE\'S SUPREME COURT </p><p>OVERRULED THE NOVEMBER 20 HIGH COURT DECISION TO GIVE </p><p>"INTERIM RELIEF" TO FARM SQUATTERS FACING EVICTION FROM </p><p>OCCUPIED FARMS.  IN RESPONDING TO A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT </p><p>ON BEHALF OF RURAL PEASANT FARMERS (REF B), THE HIGH </p><p>COURT\'S JUDGE PRESIDENT, GODFREY CHIDYASIKU, IN EFFECT </p><p>TRIED TO SUSPEND THE SUPREME COURT\'S CONSENT DECREE, </p><p>WHICH ORDERED POLICE TO REMOVE ILLEGALLY SETTLED </p><p>SQUATTERS FROM COMMERCIAL FARMS.  ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>NOVEMBER 25 "THE HERALD," THE SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY </p><p>RULED THAT THE HIGH COURT DECISION "IS INVALID AND OF NO </p><p>FORCE AND EFFECT" AND THAT THE HIGH COURT HAS NO </p><p>AUTHORITY TO OVERRULE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS.  SINCE </p><p>THE CLASS ACTION WAS MADE AS A CHALLENGE ON </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS, CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY GUBBAY, </p><p>ASKED THE CLAIMANT RHETORICALLY WHY THE CASE WAS NOT </p><p>BROUGHT BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH IS THE ONLY </p><p>COURT EMPOWERED TO HEAR CONSTITUTIONAL CASES. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) IN SPEAKING TO DCM AND POLOFF NOVEMBER 28, BRIAN </p><p>RAFTOPOULOS, RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES, STATED THAT </p><p>THE HIGH COURT JUDGE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO CREATE </p><p>CLEAVAGES IN THE JUDICIARY.  THE PROCESS TO REMOVE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06660  281636Z </p><p>JUSTICES IS TOO SLOW FOR PRESIDENT MUGABE, RAFTOPOULOS </p><p>CONTINUED, SO HE IS LOOKING FOR OTHER WAYS TO UNDERMINE </p><p>THE JUDICIARY.  OTHER INTERLOCUTORS HAVE TOLD US THAT </p><p>JUSTICE CHIDYASIKU IS ONE OF SEVERAL JUSTICES ON THE </p><p>HIGH COURT LOYAL TO ZANU-PF.  RAFTOPOULOS BELIEVES THAT </p><p>JUSTICES SYMPATHETIC TO THE RULING PARTY MAY IN THE </p><p>FUTURE TRY TO EXPLOIT AMBIGUITIES IN THE LAW TO FURTHER </p><p>ITS CAUSE.  THE ATTORNEY REPRESENTING THE CLASS ACTION </p><p>CLAIMANTS HAD ARGUED TO THE SUPREME COURT THAT THE HIGH </p><p>COURT HAD "INHERENT JURISDICTION AS A COURT OF JUSTICE </p><p>TO PREVENT A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: THE JUDGE PRESIDENT\'S ATTEMPT TO </p><p>OVERRULE THE SUPREME COURT, AND THE WAR VETERANS\' BRIEF </p><p>INVASION OF THE SUPREME COURT BUILDING ON NOVEMBER 24 </p><p>(REF A) COULD PRESAGE AN INTENSIFIED ZANU-PF CAMPAIGN </p><p>AGAINST THE JUDICIARY.  DESPITE THE BLATANT ATTEMPT TO </p><p>INTIMIDATE THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES BEFORE THEIR </p><p>RULING, THE JUSTICES QUICKLY REGROUPED AND DECISIVELY </p><p>STRUCK DOWN A HIGH COURT RULING THAT HAD LITTLE LEGAL </p><p>MERIT.  IN SOME CASES, POLICE HAVE BEGUN ISSUING </p><p>EVICTION ORDERS TO FARM SQUATTERS, BUT NO LARGE-SCALE </p><p>ACTION IS BEING TAKEN TO IMPLEMENT THE SUPREME COURT\'S </p><p>CONSENT ORDER TO REMOVE THE SQUATTERS. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
