(C) PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S NATIONAL HEROES\' DAY ADDRESS </p><p>TO A LARGE BUT LISTLESS CROWD AT HEROES\' ACRE WAS </p><p>DEFIANT IN TONE AND UNCHANGED IN SUBSTANCE.  MUGABE </p><p>LAMBASTED THE BRITISH FOR THEIR HISTORICAL SINS AND TOOK </p><p>AIM AT THE U.S. OVER THE SENATE PASSAGE OF ZDERA.  HE </p><p>TALLIED UP FIGURES FOR LAND ACQUIRED AND PEOPLED </p><p>RESETTLED IN THE FAST TRACK LAND PROGRAM AND WARNED </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS NOT TO RESIST.  MUGABE CALLED ON </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS TO COOPERATE AND IMPLIED TROUBLE IF </p><p>THEY DID NOT.  IN FOLLOWING CONVERSATIONS, UK HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER DONNELLY TERMED THE ADDRESS "AN OLIVE </p><p>BRANCH WITH THORNS."  OTHER WESTERN DIPLOMATS WITH MORE </p><p>SEASONING IN ZIMBABWE WONDERED IF THIS WERE NOT AN </p><p>OVERLY OPTIMISTIC READ. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>THE ANGLO-SAXON CONSPIRACY </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) A CROWD ESTIMATED BETWEEN 4,000 (OPPOSITION </p><p>PRESS) AND 10,000 (GOVERNMENT PRESS) WERE TREATED TO AN </p><p>HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES OF PRESIDENTIAL RHETORIC ON </p><p>AUGUST 11.  A HEARTY LOOKING MUGABE, WHO DELIVERED HIS </p><p>ADDRESS IN FIRM TONES, BEGAN WITH A CONDEMNATION OF </p><p>WESTERN HYPOCRISY.  HE ACCUSED THE DEMOCRATIC WORLD OF </p><p>NOT RAISING A FINGER IN THE PAST AS THE "BRITISH RACIAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02397  01 OF 02  141201Z </p><p>AUTOCRACY" BRUTALIZED AND TRAUMATIZED BLACK ZIMBABWEANS. </p><p>HE ACCUSED THE COLONIALISTS OF PILLAGING THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>MINERAL WEALTH AND FORCING THE ZIMBABWEANS TO WORKS THE </p><p>LAND "TO FEED THEIR (BRITISH) CHILDREN."  HE ACCUSED UK, </p><p>US, AND GERMAN MERCENARIES OF FIGHTING ON THE SIDE OF </p><p>THE RHODESIANS DURING THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE, USING </p><p>NATO WEAPONS AGAINST THE POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) MUGABE DELIVERED A DIATRIBE AGAINST THE </p><p>AMERICAN SENATE AND CONGRESS, WHO HE STATED HAD NEVER </p><p>CONSIDERED IMPOSING SANCTIONS AGAINST THE UDI </p><p>RHODESIANS.  INSTEAD, THE U.S. HAD ASKED TO BE EXEMPTED </p><p>FROM UN SANCTIONS IN ORDER TO BUY CHROME FROM THE IAN </p><p>SMITH REGIME, REFUSING THE OPTION OF BUYING FROM THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION, WHICH WAS "A FREE STATE AT THAT TIME."  HE </p><p>CHARGED THE SAME SENATORS OF WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION </p><p>TODAY ON THE "INFAMOUS ZDERA."  HE ASKED RHETORICALLY </p><p>WHAT CRIME ZIMBABWE HAD COMMITTED TO CAUSE TALK OF </p><p>SANCTIONS, THEN ANSWERED BY SAYING HOW DARE A BLACK </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITH A WHITE COMMUNITY CHALLENGE THE KIN OF </p><p>THE GOD-CHOSEN ANGLO-SAXONS.  THIS WAS SEEN AS </p><p>PRACTICING TERRORISM AND AUTOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>A WALLOW IN COLONIAL HISTORY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) MUGABE NEXT TOOK DIRECT AIM AT THE BRITISH, </p><p>NOTING THAT VICE PRESIDENT MUZENDA HAD BEEN TORTURED </p><p>WITH NEEDLES WHILE IN INCARCERATION.  SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT MNANGAGWA WAS HARD OF HEARING DUE TO BEATINGS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02397  01 OF 02  141201Z </p><p>FROM PRISON AUTHORITIES.  MUGABE THEN READ FROM THE </p><p>JOURNALS OF COLONIAL AUTHORITIES ABOUT THE 1897/1898 </p><p>EXECUTION IN SALISBURY OF TWO MEN AND A WOMAN CONVICTED </p><p>OF MURDERING AN ASSISTANT DISTRICT COMMISSIONER.  HE </p><p>CONTINUED BY CRITICIZING BRITISH REFUSAL TO RETURN THE </p><p>HEAD OF AN EXECUTION VICTIM STILL HELD IN (THE) BRITISH </p><p>MUSEUM.  MUGABE DESCRIBED THE BURNING OF CROPS BY </p><p>BRITISH SOLDIERS IN 1896/7 AND HOW INVADERS HAD CAUSED </p><p>"ARTIFICIAL HUNGER." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>HOLDING FIRM ON LAND </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) MUGABE SEGUED INTO THE LAND ISSUE, EMPHASIZING </p><p>THAT "WE WILL NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE GOAL OF </p><p>CONTROLLING THE LAND."  HE REPEATED THE STANDARD LINE ON </p><p>THE FAST TRACK PROGRAM, CALLING COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE </p><p>UNFAIR, INEFFICIENT, AND NOT ENVIRONMENTALLY </p><p>SUSTAINABLE.  HE DENOUNCED "RACIAL, IMPERIALIST </p><p>DOMINANCE" BUT NOTED THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT PARTS OF THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) HAD CHANGED THEIR HEARTS </p><p>AND WANTED TO JOIN THE GOVERNMENT IN REFORM.

IN THE PAST, HOWEVER, FARMERS HAD EMPLOYED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02397  02 OF 02  141202Z </p><p>WILES AND SUBTERFUGE AND WORKED WITH THE "SO-CALLED" </p><p>OPPOSITION TO EXTEND BRITISH HEGEMONY BY PROCURING UK </p><p>MONEY FOR THE OPPOSITION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) HE SPOKE DIRECTLY TO RECENT EVENTS IN </p><p>CHINHOYI, CHARGING THAT THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS HAD </p><p>ORGANIZED TO ATTACK LANDLESS SETTLERS.  HE STATED: "WE </p><p>WARN THEM (FARMERS) TO DESIST."  MUGABE SAID THAT WHITE </p><p>FARMERS ARE WELCOME TO STAY BUT ONLY IF THEY OBEY THE </p><p>LAW.  HE SAID THAT THE GOZ WILL NOT BUDGE ON LAND </p><p>REFORM, AND WILL PROCEED WITH THE REFORM PROGRAM WITH OR </p><p>WITHOUT CFU COOPERATION AND INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS. </p><p>MUGABE THEN READ A LIST OF THE NUMBER OF FARMS GAZETTED, </p><p>ACREAGE TOTALS, AND PEOPLE RESETTLED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>QUOTING HIMSELF ON RECONCILIATION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) MUGABE STRESSED THAT WHAT ANGERS AND DISTURBS </p><p>THE CIO, POLICE, AND ZDF MOST IS THE FACT THAT THE </p><p>FARMERS NOW PROVOKING INCIDENTS ARE THE SAME ONES WHO </p><p>FOUGHT AGAINST THE CURRENT AUTHORITIES IN THE LIBERATION </p><p>STRUGGLE.  HE OBSERVED THAT IF HE HAD DONE AS THE </p><p>MILITANTS HAD WANTED IN 1980, THE (FORMER RHODESIAN </p><p>FIGHTERS) WOULD HAVE BEEN "DECAPITATED" AND WOULD NOT </p><p>"BE WRIGGLING BACK TO LIFE AGAIN."  HE SAID THAT WE </p><p>(ZIMBABWEANS) WERE BETTER, MORE MORAL, AND HAD INSTEAD </p><p>EXTENDED THE HAND OF FRIENDSHIP AND RECONCILIATION. </p><p>MUGABE QUOTED HIMSELF FROM 1980 ON BEATING SWORDS INTO </p><p>PLOWSHARES BEFORE CONCLUDING WITH SOME PORK BARREL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02397  02 OF 02  141202Z </p><p>POLITICS -- INCREASED SCHOOL (AND OTHER) ALLOWANCES FOR </p><p>THE WIDOWS AND CHILDREN OF HEROES -- AND A FINAL </p><p>CONCLUDING SHOT AT ZDERA AND THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) MUGABE WAS IN FINE FETTLE, AND HIS PERFORMANCE </p><p>-- DEMAGOGIC THOUGH IT OFTEN WAS -- PUTS TO REST FOR NOW </p><p>TALK THAT HE IS TOTTERING ON THE BRINK OF PHYSICAL </p><p>COLLAPSE.  WESTERN DIPLOMATS WHO HAVE BEEN TREATED TO </p><p>PAST PERFORMANCES NOTED THAT THERE WAS AN UNUSUALLY </p><p>LARGE COMPONENT OF UNIFORMED MILITARY IN THE AUDIENCE </p><p>THIS YEAR.  THE CROWD CHEERED ON CUE, BUT THERE WAS A </p><p>NOTABLE LACK OF ENTHUSIASM OVERALL. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IN A FOLLOWING CONVERSATION, BRITISH HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER DONNELLY SPOKE ON THE CHINHOYI SITUATION AS </p><p>WELL AS HIS TAKE ON THE SPEECH.  HE SAID THAT THE CFU </p><p>TEAM NEGOTIATING THE LAND ISSUE WITH THE GOZ HAD </p><p>REPORTED A "GOOD" MEETING WITH MUGABE ON AUGUST 19, </p><p>ALBEIT ONE THAT HAD BROUGHT NO BREAKTHROUGH.  CONNELLY </p><p>CALLED THE SPEECH AN "OLIVE BRANCH WITH THORNS." </p><p>SEVERAL OF HIS WESTERN COUNTERPARTS WHO HAVE BEEN IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE FOR LONGER PERIODS TOLD CHARGE THAT THEY HAD </p><p>PERCEIVED MORE THORN THAN OLIVE BRANCH AND FELT THAT </p><p>MUGABE\'S POSITION REMAINS UNCHANGED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) THE SENATE\'S PASSAGE OF ZDERA HAS CLEARLY </p><p>CAUGHT MUGABE\'S ATTENTION.  DONNELLY OBSERVED THAT WHILE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02397  02 OF 02  141202Z </p><p>THE UK\'S SINS HAD BEEN MOSTLY HISTORICAL THIS TIME </p><p>AROUND, THE U.S. WAS NOW GRABBING TOP BILLING IN THE </p><p>AREA OF CURRENT EVENTS. </p><p> </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
