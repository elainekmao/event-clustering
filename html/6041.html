<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001345 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR (D) ARMITAGE, (P) GROSSMAN, (EUR) JONES </p><p>NSC FOR HADLEY, FRIED </p><p>OVP FOR EDELMAN </p><p>OSD FOR WOLFOWITZ, FEITH </p><p>JCS FOR CJCS MYERS </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKISH PARLIAMENT REJECTS U.S. TROOP </p><p>DEPLOYMENT </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson. Reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) On March 1, in closed session, the Turkish Parliament </p><p>rejected a motion that would have allowed the U.S. to deploy </p><p>troops for operations against Iraq.  Of the 533 members </p><p>present, 264 voted in favor and 250 against.  19 MPs </p><p>abstained.  Article 96 of the Constitution requires that an </p><p>absolute majority of the MPs present support a motion to </p><p>secure passage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Speaker Bulent Arinc adjourned Parliament until </p><p>Tuesday, March 4.  Though there are time limits for the </p><p>resubmission of law that fail to pass parliament, motions are </p><p>not subject to such limits.  Therefore, it is possible for </p><p>the GOT once again to bring this motion to Parliament for a </p><p>vote.  Whether the GOT will pursue this option, however, is </p><p>not predictable at this moment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The failure to secure the necessary votes to pass the </p><p>motion is a serious blow to the AK government -- in </p><p>particular to AK leader R. Tayyip Erdogan, who had put his </p><p>prestige as party leader behind the motion\'s success.  Ahead </p><p>of the vote, the opposition Republican People\'s Party (CHP) </p><p>had made it clear that its MPs would vote against the motion </p><p>as a bloc.  CHP has 177 members of Parliament and the </p><p>governing AK Party has 363.  We do not yet know the party </p><p>membership of the 16 members of Parliament who were not </p><p>present for the vote.  Nonetheless, at least 90 AK MPs, or </p><p>approximately 25 percent of the AK parliamentary delegation, </p><p>failed to support the government. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
