<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001357 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: FRG NOMINATES RIOS MONTT FOR PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1172 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The ruling Guatemalan Republican Front </p><p>(FRG) nominated its founding leader, Efrain Rios Montt, for </p><p>President; former Agriculture Minister Edin Barrientos for </p><p>Vice President; and corrupt former Minister of Public Works </p><p>Luis Rabbe was nominated for Mayor of Guatemala City by a </p><p>party conclave on May 24.  The selection of Rios Montt does </p><p>not ultimately resolve the issue of whether he will be the </p><p>FRG standard-bearer, as constitutional challenges are </p><p>expected to emerge once the FRG registers his candidacy with </p><p>the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.  For the moment, however, </p><p>Rios Montt\'s candidacy could help unify a fragmented </p><p>opposition.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) At a party assembly on May 24, the ruling FRG </p><p>nominated retired General and former de facto head of state </p><p>Efrain Rios Montt for President, and Edin Barrientos for Vice </p><p>President.  Party leaders announced that they will decide by </p><p>the end of May when they will officially register their </p><p>candidate with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE).  The NGO </p><p>Center for the Defense of the Constitution (CEDECON) has </p><p>already announced that it will challenge the </p><p>constitutionality of Rios Montt\'s eligibility to run for </p><p>President, in the event the TSE allows him to register.  The </p><p>Constitutional Court ruled against Rios Montt\'s presidential </p><p>candidacy in 1990, based on Constitutional Article 186 (a), </p><p>which prohibits candidates who attained power through </p><p>extra-constitutional means from eligibility to run for </p><p>president.  The composition of the Constitutional Court has </p><p>changed, however, and under Guatemalan law, decisions of the </p><p>Constitutional Court are not binding on future decisions. </p><p>Rios Montt has assembled a "dream team" of constitutional </p><p>lawyers, including former Foreign Minister Gabriel Orellana, </p><p>to argue his case.  They will argue that the constitutional </p><p>principle of non-retroactivity should be applied to this </p><p>case, since the Constitution took effect in 1985, after Rios </p><p>Montt had been installed by coup d\'etat and served as head of </p><p>government in 1982-83. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Edin Barrientos, Rios Montt\'s running-mate, had </p><p>served as Agriculture Minister and previously worked as a </p><p>consultant to USAID.  The FRG gave prominent billing at its </p><p>assembly to Luis Rabbe, the FRG candidate for Mayor of </p><p>Guatemala City.  Rabbe has been the subject of numerous </p><p>lawsuits for his mishandling of state funds while he was </p><p>Minister of Public Works. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) A Prensa Libre-commissioned political opinion poll </p><p>published May 27 put GANA coalition presidential nominee </p><p>Oscar Berger in front of voter preferences with 39%, followed </p><p>by Alvaro Colom of the National Unity of Hope Party (UNE) at </p><p>9% and Rios Montt at only 4%;  33%  of the 1,200 people </p><p>polled nationwide were undecided and 7% said they would not </p><p>vote for anyone.  The poll was also reported that widespread </p><p>confusion over Berger\'s abandonment of the National </p><p>Advancement Party (PAN); 32% believe that Berger is still the </p><p>PAN candidate, and the PAN ranked as the highest chance of </p><p>winning the elections, with 39%.  (Note:  Berger left the PAN </p><p>after differences with party secretary Leonel Lopez Rodas on </p><p>May 1 (RefTel).  He now heads the GANA coalition comprised of </p><p>the Patriotic Party (PP), the Reform Movement (MR), and the </p><p>National Solidarity Party (PSN). End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The FRG\'s affirmation of Rios Montt as its </p><p>presidential standard-bearer sets the stage for the General </p><p>to face constitutional challenges head-on in the five months </p><p>remaining before the elections.  It shifts the political </p><p>focus to the Constitutional Court, which is expected to rule </p><p>on his candidacy by the end of June.  If challenges are </p><p>raised and the court rules in Rios Montt\'s favor, he will be </p><p>free to run.  The selection of Barrientos for the vice </p><p>presidency helps balance (i.e. improve) the FRG\'s image with </p><p>the electorate, but FRG insiders tell us that Barrientos is </p><p>not viewed as a possible substitute for Rios Montt.  The more </p><p>revealing move, in our view, was the FRG\'s selection of </p><p>notoriously corrupt former Public Works Minister Luis Rabbe </p><p>for Mayor. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The recent poll, commissioned and executed by </p><p>anti-government media, is consistent with previous polls </p><p>showing the FRG and Rios Montt as also-rans, though we would </p><p>warn that polls are often misleading in Guatemala.  Berger </p><p>cannot be too sanguine about his lead, however, as the polls </p><p>also reflect his precipitous drop since entering the race as </p><p>the presumptive PAN candidate in October, 2002.  (Note:  In </p><p>1999, Berger also entered the race the favorite, left the PAN </p><p>and then returned, and lost in a landslide to the FRG\'s </p><p>Portillo.  End Note.)  Nevertheless, Berger will benefit from </p><p>the FRG\'s nomination of Rios Montt, which is likely to </p><p>polarize the presidential race between FRG and anti-FRG </p><p>forces.  Berger is attempting to broaden his coalition by </p><p>courting the Left, and Rios Montt\'s long-awaited decision to </p><p>run may lead some to overcome their scruples and join with </p><p>Berger in the hopes that unifying the opposition is the only </p><p>way to defeat Rios Montt. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
