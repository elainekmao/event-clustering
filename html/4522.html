<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 005166 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/FO, NEA/ARP </p><p>DEPT FOR DS, DSS, DS/OP/NEA, INR/B, INR/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, PTER, PINR, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: (U) CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP AT STATE SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM FRANK URBANCIC; REASON: 1.5 (B, D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Kuwait\'s Assistant Under Secretary for State </p><p>Security Affairs (i.e. head of Kuwait State Security, KSS) </p><p>Shaykh Mishaal al-Jarrah al-Sabah was not renewed in his </p><p>position when his term expired November 17.  He has been </p><p>replaced on an acting basis by Major General Abdallah </p><p>Abdul-Rahman al-Faris. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The decision not to renew Shaykh Mishaal was taken </p><p>by First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Shaykh </p><p>Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who is the de facto ruler given </p><p>the poor health of the Amir and the Crown Prince.  Two </p><p>senior members of the ruling family separately told the </p><p>Ambassador that the move was a matter of ruling-family </p><p>politics:  Shaykh Sabah is feuding with Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister and Interior Minister Shaykh Mohammed al-Khaled </p><p>al-Hamad al-Sabah (Shaykh Mishaal\'s boss), and Shaykh </p><p>Mishaal got caught in the middle.  According to Minister of </p><p>State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed al-Sabah al- </p><p>Salem al-Sabah, one reason for Shaykh Sabah\'s displeasure </p><p>was that the security services had not prevented the </p><p>October 8 Failaka attack in which one US Marine was killed </p><p>and another wounded.  Both Dr. Mohammed and Shaykh Nasser </p><p>Mohammed al-Ahmed al-Sabah, Minister of State for Amiri </p><p>Diwan Affairs, assured the Ambassador that nothing would be </p><p>allowed to affect Kuwait\'s counter-terrorism cooperation </p><p>with the United States. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The new acting head of KSS is approximately two </p><p>years shy of the mandatory retirement age of 65. Major </p><p>General al-Faris is a career CID officer who rose through </p><p>the ranks to become General Director of CID before being </p><p>named Assistant Under Secretary for Security Services </p><p>Support in 1996 or 1997.  He retains that post (a not- </p><p>uncommon arrangement in Kuwait).  Al-Faris has not had much </p><p>exposure to counter-terrorism, force-protection, or Iraq </p><p>issues.  The Ambassador has impressed upon Shaykh Sabah </p><p>personally the vital importance of supporting the security </p><p>services both materially and politically. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
