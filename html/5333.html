<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 000649 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, NEA/NGA, EUR/SE, PRM/ANE AND PM (PM ACTION </p><p>TEAM); OSD FOR ISA AND ISP; JCS FOR J5 AND J3, EUCOM FOR </p><p>J3, J4, J5 AND POLAD; CENTCOM FOR J3, J5 AND POLAD; NSC FOR </p><p>KHALILZAD AND B. MILLER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ:  TGS REQUESTS ANSWERS TO PHASE IV QUESTIONS </p><p>BY JAN 30 MIL TALKS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) ANKARA 629 B) ANKARA 625 C) ANKARA 539 AND </p><p>        PREVIOUS D) STATE 18029 </p><p>     B. E) STATE 261517 (NODIS) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action message.  See para 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) The Turkish General Staff (TGS) provided visiting </p><p>CENTCOM/EUCOM planners January 23 questions (see para 4) </p><p>concerning Phase IV operations in Iraq.  TGS requested that </p><p>appropriate USG authorities respond to the questions during </p><p>the next round of mil-to-mil talks (January 30) in Ankara. </p><p>January 27-Jan 31 is a key week for Turkish decision-making </p><p>on Iraq.  Turkish concerns and questions about Phase IV have </p><p>dominated the US-Turkey political and military discussions on </p><p>Iraq to date.  Many of these questions involve non-military </p><p>issues.  These are also the questions we anticipate the Turks </p><p>will raise with the USG Humanitarian Planning Team (January </p><p>27-29) and that we need to answer in preparing for </p><p>trilateral/quintilateral talks.  Post recognizes that senior </p><p>USG officials are still formulating positions on some of the </p><p>issues addressed in TGS\'s questions, and that we are not </p><p>likely to have definitive answers to many of these questions </p><p>by the next mil-to-mil meeting January 30.  However, we </p><p>believe that our ability to provide detailed responses (where </p><p>possible) will go a long way toward increasing pressure on </p><p>TGS to provide the GOT its views on the larger USG requests </p><p>regarding Turkey\'s role in a possible Iraq operation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Embassy recommends that the Department, in conjunction </p><p>with other appropriate USG agencies, provide EUCOM and </p><p>Embassy Ankara answers to as many of TGS\'s questions as </p><p>possible no later than COB January 29 (Washington time). </p><p>Post further recommends that Washington\'s response to this </p><p>request include a reiteration of the USG invitation (ref e) </p><p>for the GOT to include the appropriate civilian and military </p><p>planners in the planning process, both at CENTCOM and here in </p><p>Turkey.  End action request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>TGS\'S QUESTIONS ON PHASE IV </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Below are the questions that TGS provided </p><p>CENTCOM/EUCOM planners last week during the planning talks </p><p>(note:  Embassy only received the questions January 25): </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>QUESTIONS RELATED TO PHASE IV OF POSSIBLE IRAQI OPERATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Below are some questions that need to be answered for the </p><p>next mil-mil discussions during the last week of January </p><p>2003.
