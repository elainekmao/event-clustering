<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 TEGUCIGALPA 001259 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR L/CID </p><p>FOR EB/IFD/OIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, EFIN, PGOV, KIDE, KSPR, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: 2003 EXPROPRIATION REPORT: HONDURAS </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 83098 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) </p><p>HONDURAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     The United States Government is aware of thirteen (13) </p><p>claims of United States persons that may be outstanding against </p><p>the Government of Honduras (GOH).  The U.S. Government is also </p><p>aware of numerous other investment disputes involving U.S. </p><p>investors, the majority of which have arisen out of inadequate </p><p>titling procedures and involve disputes between U.S. citizens and </p><p>private Honduran citizens. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Eight of the claims described below involve the Honduran </p><p>National Agrarian Institute (INA) and land invasion by squatters. </p><p>Land invasions are common for both Honduran and foreign </p><p>landowners.  According to the National Agrarian Reform Law, idle </p><p>land fit for farming can be expropriated and awarded to the </p><p>landless poor.  Generally, an INA expropriation case begins after </p><p>squatters target and invade unprotected property. The squatters </p><p>then file for the land with the INA under the Agrarian Reform </p><p>Law.  In most cases, pursuing the subsequent legal avenues have </p><p>proven to be costly and time consuming, and have rarely lead to </p><p>positive results.  The U.S. Embassy is actively engaged in </p><p>dialogue with the INA and claimants in order to encourage </p><p>progress toward resolution of outstanding disputes.  Most cases </p><p>reported below require further legal action in Honduran courts by </p><p>the claimants or decisions by the court. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) a) Claimant A </p><p> </p><p>     b) 1985 </p><p> </p><p>     c) Claimant A\'s family land known as Jerico was taken over </p><p>by the Mayor of Trujillo in 1985.  That same year, the </p><p>Municipality began titling and selling off parcels of Claimant </p><p>A\'s land.  By 1991 Claimant A had won every court case up through </p><p>the Supreme Court level, thereby declaring Claimant A\'s family as </p><p>the legal owners of Jerico lands.  Claimant A requested that the </p><p>public registrar\'s office inscribe the court\'s rulings and </p><p>correct the situation in the public registry, having falsely </p><p>registered the illegal titles. </p><p> </p><p>To date the Municipality of Trujillo has not returned the </p><p>parceled sections of land to Claimant A\'s family.  In May 2002, </p><p>after Embassy advocacy, the public registrar informed the Embassy </p><p>that Claimant A\'s lands were officially inscribed in the </p><p>registry.  Legally, that office can no longer register titles </p><p>issued by the Municipality for Jerico lands.  Claimant A alleges </p><p>that the Municipality continues to title and sell Jerico lands </p><p>under a different name. </p><p> </p><p>In April 2003, the Embassy informed Claimant A of the GOH\'s new </p><p>arbitration procedure (Decreto No. 349-2002) that allows the </p><p>government and claimants to jointly submit disputes for </p><p>arbitration as an alternative to continued legal proceedings. </p><p>Claimant A informed the Embassy the family is interested in </p><p>entering into arbitration with the Municipality, however the </p><p>Mayor is not.  The Mayor instead wishes to draft a private, extra- </p><p>judicial agreement with Claimant A\'s family.  The Embassy </p><p>continues to encourage the two parties to reach an agreement. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) a) Claimant B </p><p> </p><p>     b) 1984 </p><p> </p><p>     c) Claimant B inherited 2,417 acres of land from his father. </p><p>Claimant B\'s dispute started in 1963 when peasant groups squatted </p><p>on his father\'s land.  Allegedly in 1975, INA signed a letter of </p><p>intent to purchase the land but never did.  In 1984 when small </p><p>farmers began squatting on Claimant B\'s land near Nacaome, Valle </p><p>Department, Claimant B again offered to sell the land to INA. </p><p>Claimant B reported he has documents showing that the INA </p><p>intended to initiate expropriation proceedings in 1989, though it </p><p>is not entirely clear that this process was ever actually </p><p>started.  Claimant B reports that in 1992 INA responded it was no </p><p>longer interested in purchasing the land.  INA decided not to </p><p>follow through with the expropriation order, but instead </p><p>suggested that Claimant B sue to have the squatters removed. </p><p>Claimant B may remove the liens in civil-court procedures and get </p><p>a court order to remove the squatters.  Due to Claimant B\'s ill </p><p>health, legal proceedings were never initiated. </p><p> </p><p>In June 2002, Claimant B\'s son reported that a court case is </p><p>still an option. In April 2003, the Embassy informed Claimant B </p><p>of the GOH\'s new arbitration procedure (Decreto No. 349-2002) </p><p>that allows the government and claimants to jointly submit </p><p>disputes for arbitration as an alternative to continued legal </p><p>proceedings.  Claimant B indicated he will not pursue arbitration </p><p>due to his skepticism about the arbitration procedure.  The </p><p>Embassy considers this case inactive at this time, pending </p><p>further action by Claimant B. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) a) Claimant C </p><p> </p><p>     b) 1992 </p><p> </p><p>     c) In 1990 Claimant C\'s land in Cofradia, Cortes Department </p><p>was invaded by a group of squatters.  In 1992, the INA issued a </p><p>certification of occupation (title) to the squatters.  Claimant C </p><p>reports difficulty in discussing the case with GOH officials, who </p><p>claim not to have taken action against the land.  In 1995 INA </p><p>realized this land is classified as urban and therefore claimed </p><p>to have no authority to resolve the dispute.  The agency said it </p><p>can neither give the land to the squatters nor evict them.  In </p><p>1996 the INA also reported that others have claims to the land in </p><p>addition to the squatters and Claimant C.  In December 1998 INA </p><p>issued a resolution denying a petition presented by Claimant C to </p><p>annul the title (formerly issued by INA) held by the campesino </p><p>squatters.  Claimant C has not contested the granting of this </p><p>title in court. </p><p> </p><p>At various times in recent years the Embassy has assisted </p><p>Claimant C in communicating with INA concerning his claim.  In </p><p>June 2002, Claimant C reported that he may seek to evict the </p><p>squatters in court.  In April 2003, the Embassy informed Claimant </p><p>C of the GOH\'s new arbitration procedure (Decreto No. 349-2002) </p><p>that allows the government and claimants to jointly submit </p><p>disputes for arbitration as an alternative to continued legal </p><p>proceedings.  The Embassy has yet to receive a response from </p><p>Claimant C concerning arbitration and considers this case </p><p>inactive at this time, pending further action by the claimant. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) a) Claimants D </p><p> </p><p>     b) 1974 </p><p> </p><p>     c) Claimants D are a U.S. citizen brother and sister with 42 </p><p>hectares of property near Balfate, Atlantida Department. </p><p>Claimants D report squatter problems beginning in 1974 when the </p><p>INA reportedly placed squatters "temporarily" on their land. </p><p>Despite repeated promises from GOH officials, no action has been </p><p>taken to evict these squatters.  A group of squatters who arrived </p><p>more recently and who repeatedly threatened the owners was </p><p>removed by Honduran authorities at the request of the Embassy, </p><p>which has worked extensively on Claimants\' behalf.  According to </p><p>INA attorneys, in 1974 INA began proceedings to expropriate much </p><p>of the land belonging to Claimants D. </p><p> </p><p>In late 1995, INA officials told the Embassy that it was planning </p><p>formally to expropriate a portion of the property, not including </p><p>valuable beachfront, and compensate Claimants D.  In 1997, GOH </p><p>officials confirmed this remained their intention.  One of the </p><p>Claimants visited the Embassy and reiterated opposition to the </p><p>expropriation.  While in the past Claimants D had reportedly </p><p>contracted with a lawyer to prosecute their claim, the Embassy </p><p>has no current knowledge regarding the status of Claimants D\'s </p><p>legal actions.  The most recent information received by the </p><p>Embassy confirms that INA is in the final stages of expropriating </p><p>the property.  Despite not hearing from Claimants D since 1996, </p><p>the Embassy, through regular communication with the INA office in </p><p>Tegucigalpa, has advocated for a fair and transparent resolution </p><p>to this case. In April 2003, the Embassy informed Claimants D of </p><p>the GOH\'s new arbitration procedure (Decreto No. 349-2002) that </p><p>allows the government and claimants to jointly submit disputes </p><p>for arbitration as an alternative to continued legal proceedings. </p><p>The Embassy has yet to receive a response from Claimant D </p><p>concerning arbitration and considers this case inactive at this </p><p>time, pending further action by the claimant. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) a) Claimant E </p><p> </p><p>     b) 1975 </p><p> </p><p>     c) Claimant E contacted the Department of State in July </p><p>1996, alleging that his property, which he had leased from INA </p><p>and then developed into a large banana plantation, had been </p><p>invaded by squatters with the encouragement of GOH officials. </p><p>Claimant E explained that he had previously filed a lawsuit in </p><p>Honduran courts and lost.  Claimant E has exhausted all </p><p>administrative and legal avenues of recourse, culminating in an </p><p>unfavorable Supreme Court ruling. </p><p> </p><p>The Embassy has helped arrange meetings between Claimant E and </p><p>the President of the Supreme Court, the Vice-President of the </p><p>country and the INA Director.  The Department of State has </p><p>reviewed information and evidence provided by Claimant E </p><p>pertaining to his claim and his efforts to resolve it, and is </p><p>considering whether the circumstances of his case would support a </p><p>U.S. Government espousal action based upon a denial of justice </p><p>claim. </p><p> </p><p>Honduran government officials maintain that while Honduran law </p><p>requires the payment of compensation for improvements made on </p><p>leased land that is expropriated under Honduras\' land reform </p><p>laws, the Honduran Supreme Court decision against compensation </p><p>for Claimant E makes such a settlement impossible.  In 2002, the </p><p>Embassy has met with several high level representatives in the </p><p>Honduran government to push for consideration of possible forms </p><p>of resolution of this and similar cases.  GOH officials, however, </p><p>repeatedly state that since this case has been decided at the </p><p>Supreme Court level, there is nothing more that can be done for </p><p>Claimant E and they consider this case closed. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) a) Claimant F </p><p> </p><p>     b) 1991 </p><p> </p><p>     c) In 1991, a squatter group invaded Claimant F\'s property </p><p>near Guaimaca, Francisco Morazan Department.  INA issued the </p><p>squatters a "certificate of occupation" for the land in 1992. </p><p>The INA subsequently revoked the certificate when Claimant F </p><p>contested it, but the squatter group remained.  Claimant F later </p><p>offered to give the group a portion of the property to resolve </p><p>the dispute.  The squatters declined the offer, and did not allow </p><p>anyone to enter the land.  They threatened violence against </p><p>people seeking to evict them and several times threatened to kill </p><p>Claimant F. </p><p> </p><p>Claimant F contacted the Embassy in February 1998 to ask for </p><p>assistance in resolving the case. In April 1998, Claimant F </p><p>traveled to Honduras, met with the Embassy, and hired a new </p><p>attorney.  Claimant F, Embassy officers, and Claimant F\'s </p><p>attorney met with the INA\'s attorney several times to discuss the </p><p>case.  The INA agreed to work with Claimant F to persuade the </p><p>squatters to accept Claimant F\'s prior offer to avoid a court </p><p>battle. </p><p> </p><p>Working closely with the Embassy, the INA accepted Claimant F\'s </p><p>offer to donate 176 hectares of agricultural land to the INA to </p><p>give to the campesino squatters in return for INA\'s help in </p><p>evicting the squatters from the rest of his land.  In May 2001, </p><p>Claimant F filed a criminal suit against the squatters, who were </p><p>summarily evicted from the property.  However, a few of the </p><p>original squatters reinvaded the land several weeks later. </p><p>Claimant F indicated that the offer to donate substitute land was </p><p>conditioned on certain actions by the INA and that the offer had </p><p>expired. </p><p> </p><p>In January 2003, INA expropriated 176 hectares of Claimants F\'s </p><p>land and granted him 80,020.36 lempiras in compensation (USD </p><p>4,644.25 - roughly USD 10 per acre).  Claimant F has appealed to </p><p>the National Agrarian Counsel for a overturning of the INA\'s </p><p>resolution to expropriate his land.  Claimant F\'s appeal is </p><p>currently pending and he has yet to receive compensation due to </p><p>his pending appeal. In April 2003, the Embassy informed Claimant </p><p>F of the GOH\'s new arbitration procedure (Decreto No. 349-2002) </p><p>that allows the government and claimants to jointly submit </p><p>disputes for arbitration as an alternative to continued legal </p><p>proceedings. The Embassy has yet to receive a response from </p><p>Claimant D concerning arbitration. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) a) Claimant G </p><p> </p><p>     b) 1993 </p><p> </p><p>     c) Claimant G purchased land in Comayagua, Comayagua </p><p>Department, in 1993.  A group of campesino squatters subsequently </p><p>invaded the land and allegedly received INA support.  Claimant G </p><p>won a complaint before the INA and paid the squatters for </p><p>improvements they made on the land in anticipation of their </p><p>removal.  However, the INA ignored its own ruling, gave title to </p><p>the squatters, and moved to annul Claimant G\'s title.  On June </p><p>30, 1998, a court ruled against Claimant G and ordered to revoke </p><p>the title.  Subsequently, INA accepted the court\'s ruling and </p><p>annulled Claimant G\'s title.  In May 2000, Claimant G filed a </p><p>legal procedure asking for the Supreme Court to review the case. </p><p>In December 2000, per a Supreme Court request, the INA sent its </p><p>file to the Court.  The Embassy understands that this case is </p><p>still pending.  In April 2003, the Embassy informed Claimant G of </p><p>the GOH\'s new arbitration procedure (Decreto No. 349-2002) that </p><p>allows the government and claimants to jointly submit disputes </p><p>for arbitration as an alternative to continued legal proceedings. </p><p>The Embassy has yet to receive a response from Claimant G </p><p>concerning arbitration and considers this case inactive at this </p><p>time, pending further action by the claimant. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) a) Claimant H </p><p> </p><p>     b) 1998 </p><p> </p><p>     c) Claimant H owned a fishing boat registered in Florida. </p><p>When the boat arrived in Roatan, Bay Islands, Honduras, in 1987, </p><p>the Honduran Navy allegedly seized it without justification (the </p><p>claim that there was no justification for the seizure remains </p><p>unsubstantiated).  After years of litigation to recover the boat, </p><p>Claimant H was notified in 1996 that the Navy had sold the boat </p><p>in 1989 by executive decree.  However, the decree was not </p><p>published in the official gazette until 1996.  Claimant appealed </p><p>through the Honduran court system up to the Supreme Court, losing </p><p>each time on procedural grounds.  The Embassy is not aware of any </p><p>recent developments in this case. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) a) Claimant I </p><p> </p><p>     b) 1999 </p><p> </p><p>     c) Claimant I owns land near El Progreso, Yoro Department. </p><p>The land suffered from squatter invasions for more than 30 years. </p><p>In 1969, Claimant I\'s now-deceased husband signed an agreement </p><p>with INA, donating some land to distribute to squatters in return </p><p>for INA\'s promise to protect the rest of the land from further </p><p>invasions.  Notwithstanding the 1969 agreement, the INA </p><p>expropriated an additional parcel of land in 1987 that had been </p><p>occupied by a separate group of squatters.  The new group of </p><p>squatters subsequently illegally sold the land to a third party </p><p>not eligible to buy it under the land reform law. </p><p> </p><p>In 1999, INA confirmed that the property belongs to Claimant I </p><p>and in 2000 issued an eviction order to evict the third-party </p><p>occupants.  The police refused to recognize INA\'s eviction order. </p><p>In 2001, the local court rejected Claimant I\'s request for an </p><p>eviction and in June 2002, the Appeal\'s court again ruled against </p><p>Claimant I.  Claimant I informed the Embassy in late 2001 that </p><p>her attorney had received death threats regarding the case and </p><p>that the attorney\'s property had been damaged.  Claimant I may </p><p>appeal the unfavorable ruling in the Supreme Court.  The Embassy </p><p>routinely raises this case with Honduran court and government </p><p>officials and will continue to assist Claimant I\'s efforts to </p><p>recover the land.  In April 2003, the Embassy informed Claimant I </p><p>of the GOH\'s new arbitration procedure (Decreto No. 349-2002) </p><p>that allows the government and claimants to jointly submit </p><p>disputes for arbitration as an alternative to continued legal </p><p>proceedings. Claimant I responded she is not interested in </p><p>pursuing arbitration. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) a) Claimant J </p><p> </p><p>     b) 2000 </p><p> </p><p>     c) Since 1927, Claimant J\'s Honduran wife\'s family has owned </p><p>the title to 44 hectares of urban land in Trujillo, Colon </p><p>Department.  Beginning in the mid 1990s, the land was invaded by </p><p>squatters.  Over the years, Claimant J\'s family won a total of </p><p>seven eviction judgments, only to see the land invaded anew after </p><p>each eviction.  In 1999, Claimant J requested from the </p><p>Municipality of Trujillo permission to divide the property into </p><p>lots for development.  The permission was never granted.  In </p><p>2000, the property was invaded for the eighth time.  In late </p><p>2000, before the court ruled on the eviction, the Municipality </p><p>began expropriation proceedings, effectively freezing the </p><p>eviction procedure. </p><p> </p><p>Claimant J suspects that the squatters invaded the land with the </p><p>tacit approval of local political leaders.  In a May 2001 meeting </p><p>with an Embassy officer, the Mayor of Trujillo admitted that the </p><p>Municipality was expropriating the land, but contradicted himself </p><p>on the justification for the expropriation.  Legal documents and </p><p>correspondence show that Claimant J has not been offered </p><p>compensation.  While the Municipality has finished its </p><p>administrative procedure to expropriate the property, the case is </p><p>still pending resolution in court.  In a May 2002 meeting with </p><p>the Ambassador, municipal officials admitted that the previous </p><p>municipal administration may have made a mistake in expropriating </p><p>Claimant J\'s property.  The officials stated that the </p><p>Municipality of Trujillo would respect the decision of the court. </p><p>Embassy officers consistently urge Honduran court and government </p><p>officials to reach a fair resolution of this case.  Embassy staff </p><p>have stayed in touch with local law enforcement officials when </p><p>the situation appears to have potential for violence.  In April </p><p>2003, the Embassy informed Claimant J of the GOH\'s new </p><p>arbitration procedure (Decreto No. 349-2002) that allows the </p><p>government and claimants to jointly submit disputes for </p><p>arbitration as an alternative to continued legal proceedings. </p><p>Claimant J has shown some interest concerning arbitration, but to </p><p>date has not moved to file his request with the Attorney </p><p>General\'s office.  The request needs to be filed by July 29, due </p><p>to the short time frame designated by the law. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) a) Claimant K </p><p>     b) 1999 </p><p> </p><p>     c) Claimant K owned 41 hectares of property on Utila, Bay </p><p>Islands, to be used to develop a tourism project.  Claimant K </p><p>estimates the value of the property at approximately $2.9 </p><p>million.  In 1999, the Ministry of Public Works announced the </p><p>public tender to build a new airport in Utila on Claimant K\'s </p><p>land and subsequently expropriated Claimant K\'s property without </p><p>paying compensation.  Claimant K requested compensation from the </p><p>Ministry of Public Works in late 2001.  Embassy officials urged </p><p>the Ministry on three occasions in 2002 to effect prompt and </p><p>effective compensation.  Ministry officials solicited the court </p><p>in Utila to confirm the legal background regarding the </p><p>expropriated property.  The court has not yet issued its opinion. </p><p>In June 2002, Ministry officials said that Claimant K\'s case will </p><p>be submitted to an inter-agency commission for a determination of </p><p>the value of the land.  In a January 2003 meeting with Embassy </p><p>officials presidential legal advisors were informed of Claimant </p><p>K\'s case.  The advisors said that they would address the issue of </p><p>compensating Claimant K with the Minister of Public Works.  The </p><p>Embassy has not received any confirmation that this was done. </p><p> </p><p>In April 2003, the Embassy informed Claimant K of the GOH\'s new </p><p>arbitration procedure (Decreto No. 349-2002) that allows the </p><p>government and claimants to jointly submit disputes for </p><p>arbitration as an alternative to continued legal proceedings. </p><p>Claimant K\'s attorneys informed the Embassy that this case is in </p><p>its final stages.  They are waiting on a final evaluation to </p><p>calculate the economic compensation to be awarded. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) a) Claimant L </p><p> </p><p>     b) 1976 </p><p> </p><p>     c) Claimant L owns land on the southeastern edge of Honduras </p><p>in territory that once was Nicaragua until the two governments </p><p>moved the boarder in 1960.  In 1976, Claimant L\'s father (then </p><p>owner) filed to register his lands with the corresponding land </p><p>registry office in Honduras but never received any reply.  In </p><p>2003, when Claimant L inherited the property she discovered the </p><p>INA had parceled off and sold almost half of the 3,460 acres of </p><p>land. In April 2003, the Embassy informed Claimant L of the GOH\'s </p><p>new arbitration procedure (Decreto No. 349-2002) that allows the </p><p>government and claimants to jointly submit disputes for </p><p>arbitration as an alternative to continued legal proceedings.  On </p><p>April 10, 2003, Claimant L filed an administrative proceeding </p><p>with the INA with plans to file for arbitration.  Claimant L </p><p>hopes for eventual economic compensation for the invaded lands. </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) a) Claimant M </p><p> </p><p>     b) 1995 </p><p> </p><p>     c) In 1995, the Municipality of La Ceiba issued a title for </p><p>land owned by Claimant M to a local Honduran family.  This family </p><p>in turn sold the lands to a third party family with very strong </p><p>political influences.  Claimant M\'s attorney filed a law-suit to </p><p>cancel said transaction, without success.  Only after continued </p><p>Embassy advocacy was the case finally sent to the Attorney </p><p>General\'s office in early 2002. In May 2002, the Attorney General </p><p>sent the case back to the Municipality of La Ceiba for final </p><p>resolution, having issued his opinion in favor of Claimant M.  On </p><p>March 28, 2003, the Municipality voted to cancel the title </p><p>originally issued to the local Honduran family.  To date, </p><p>however, the municipality has failed to actually revoke the </p><p>title, and the Honduran party has renewed its appeal efforts. </p><p> </p><p>In April 2003, the Embassy informed Claimant M of the GOH\'s new </p><p>arbitration procedure (Decreto No. 349-2002) that allows the </p><p>government and claimants to jointly submit disputes for </p><p>arbitration as an alternative to continued legal proceedings. </p><p> </p><p>16.
