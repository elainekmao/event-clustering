<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KHARTOUM 10657 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON ALSO FOR AMBASSADOR CHEEK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, PINS, MARR, EAID, PHUM, PREL, EG, IZ, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOS COUNCIL REPUTEDLY SUPPORTS DISMANTLING </p><p>RELIEF, USE OF MUSTARD GAS IN CIVIL WAR, STRENGTHENED NIF </p><p>ROLE IN SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) KHARTOUM 10523, B) KHARTOUM 6823 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL--ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  DR. MAHGOUB EL TIJANI MAHMOUD (STRICTLY </p><p>PROTECT; BIO DISCUSSED REF A) TOLD POLOFF OCT. 6 THAT IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER THE GOS "NATIONAL DEFENSE COUNCIL" SUPPORTED </p><p>DISMANTLING OF RELIEF OPERATIONS, USE OF MUSTARD GAS </p><p>AGAINST THE SUDAN PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY (SPLA), AND A </p><p>STRONGER ROLE FOR THE FUNDAMENTALIST NATIONAL ISLAMIC </p><p>FRONT (NIF) IN SECURITY OPERATIONS.  MAHGOUB ALSO </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT NIF LEADERS ARE MEETING OFTEN WITH </p><p>SUDANESE CHIEF OF STATE GEN. OMAR HASSAN AL-BASHIR.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DR. MAHGOUB, WHO CLAIMS HE RECEIVED HIS INFORMATION </p><p>FROM SOURCES SYMPATHETIC TO THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FORUM </p><p>(NDF), AN UMBRELLA GROUP FOR OPPONENTS OF THE BASHIR </p><p>GOVERNMENT, TOLD POLOFF THAT A GOS COMMITTEE CALLED THE </p><p>"NATIONAL DEFENSE COUNCIL" MET SHORTLY BEFORE GEN. OMAR\'S </p><p>RECENT VISIT TO THE U.S.  ACCORDING TO MAHGOUB, THIS </p><p>GROUP DATES FROM BEFORE THE JUNE 30, 1989, COUP AND IS </p><p>INTENDED TO EXERCISE A GENERAL INFLUENCE OVER NATIONAL </p><p>SECURITY CONCERNS.  ITS MEMBERS ARE:  THE MINISTERS OF </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS, FINANCE, AND INTERIOR; THE ATTORNEY </p><p>GENERAL; THE STATE MINISTER OF DEFENSE; THE SUDANESE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S ARMED FORCES (SPAF) COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND THREE </p><p>OF HIS PRINCIPAL COLLEAGUES (INCLUDING THE DEPUTY CHIEFS </p><p>OF STAFF FOR OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION); AND GEN. </p><p>OMAR, WHO PRESIDED AT THIS MEETING.  HASSAN AL TURABI, </p><p>LEADER OF THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT, WAS PRESENT AT </p><p>OMAR\'S INVITATION.  BECAUSE TURABI IS NOT A MEMBER AND </p><p>THIS GROUP\'S DISCUSSIONS ARE CLOSELY HELD, HIS PRESENCE </p><p>PRODUCED SOME CONCERN AMONG THE REGULAR MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO MAHGOUB, TURABI WAS INVITED BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE GROWING ROLE OF THE NIF IN SUDANESE SECURITY </p><p>OPERATIONS.  MAHGOUB TOLD POLOFF THAT THE NIF HAS ITS OWN </p><p>SECURITY ARM (THE "\'AMN AL-THAWRA," OR "SECURITY OF THE </p><p>REVOLUTION"), SEPARATE FROM THE SUDAN SECURITY BUREAU OF </p><p>THE GOS.  ITS OPERATIVES, WHO CARRY SPECIAL IDENTITY </p><p>CARDS, ARE USUALLY YOUNG AND DRESS IN WESTERN-STYLE </p><p>CLOTHES TO AVOID BEING IDENTIFIED AS NIF CADRE.  MAHGOUB </p><p>SAID THEY ARE ESPECIALLY ACTIVE AT NIGHT, PATROLLING THE </p><p>STREETS IN GROUPS ON FOOT OR IN SMALL CARS TO APPREHEND </p><p>CURFEW VIOLATORS OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DRINKING. </p><p>(MAHGOUB DESCRIBED A RUN-IN HE HAD HAD WITH THEM AFTER HE </p><p>HAD HIMSELF BEEN DRINKING.)  ACCORDING TO MAHGOUB, THE </p><p>"SHABAAT AL BINA" (YOUTH FOR RECONSTRUCTION), A RECENTLY </p><p>REPORTED INFORMAL SECURITY GROUP, IS AN NIF AUXILIARY </p><p>COMPOSED OF HIGH SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MAHGOUB SAID TURABI REPROACHED THE COUNCIL FOR </p><p>REFUSING TO STRENGTHEN NIF SECURITY ORGANS AND FOR </p><p>ACCORDING GREATER SUPPORT INSTEAD TO THE SUDAN SECURITY </p><p>BUREAU.  HE ARGUED THAT IT WAS TIME TO GIVE GREATER SCOPE </p><p>TO NIF SECURITY OPERATIONS AND ARGUED FOR A RENEWED DRIVE </p><p>AGAINST DISSIDENTS IN SUDAN--IN PART OUT OF A BELIEF THAT </p><p>WESTERN NATIONS WOULD NOT ALLOW THE BASHIR REGIME TO </p><p>REMAIN IN POWER LONG.  TURABI ALSO SUPPORTED RENEWED </p><p>ACTIVITIES TO DESTABILIZE EGYPT BY SENDING AGITATORS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY STUDENTS, TRAINED IN SUDAN INTO EGYPT TO </p><p>FOMENT UNREST BY CAUSING DISCORD BETWEEN EGYPTIAN MUSLIMS </p><p>AND COPTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACCORDING TO MAHGOUB, OMAR AGREED WITH TURABI\'S PLEA </p><p>ABOUT NIF SECURITY FORCES BUT SAID THAT THE MONEY TO </p><p>REINFORCE NIF SECURITY WAS NOT AVAILABLE.  OMAR POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT THE GOS HAD AGREED TO FUND IMAMS AND MUEZZINS AT </p><p>CONSIDERABLE COST.  (NOTE:  ON SEPT. 19 THE GOS ANNOUNCED </p><p>THAT IMAMS WOULD BE PAID 400 SUDANESE POUNDS PER MONTH </p><p>AND MUEZZINS 350 POUNDS--USDOLS 90 AND 78 RESPECTIVELY AT </p><p>THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE OF 4.45 POUNDS TO THE DOLLAR. </p><p>END NOTE.)  OMAR ADDED THAT THE INVASION OF KUWAIT BY </p><p>IRAQ HAD RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF USDOLS 140 MILLION OF </p><p>EXPECTED KUWAITI CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ISLAMIC DAW\'A IN </p><p>SUDAN, FROM WHICH MONEY FOR NIF SECURITY FORCES WAS TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN DRAWN.  ALTHOUGH UNABLE TO PROVIDE GREATER </p><p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE "SECURITY OF THE REVOLUTION," </p><p>THE COUNCIL ACCORDED TURABI SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED </p><p>INFLUENCE OVER SECURITY ACTIVITIES IN SUDAN.  NO CHANGE, </p><p>HOWEVER, WAS MADE IN THE FORMAL SECURITY STRUCTURE; </p><p>TURABI\'S ROLE IS TO BE LARGELY INFORMAL THOUGH NOT </p><p>WITHOUT INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  MAHGOUB SAID THE COUNCIL ALSO DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM </p><p>OF THE SOUTH.  THE MEMBERS AGREED THAT WESTERN RELIEF </p><p>AGENCIES POSE A BARRIER TO VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF THE </p><p>CIVIL WAR.  THEY AGREED ON A PROGRAM OF HARASSMENT AND </p><p>OBSTRUCTIONISM OF RELIEF EFFORTS INTENDED TO FORCE RELIEF </p><p>AGENCIES TO WITHDRAW FROM THE SOUTH, PREFERABLY BY THE </p><p>END OF DECEMBER 1990.  THIS PROGRAM COULD ESCALATE TO </p><p>AMBUSHES OF RELIEF WORKERS OR DESTRUCTION OF RELIEF </p><p>AIRPLANES, ESPECIALLY IF THESE ACTIONS COULD BE BLAMED ON </p><p>THE SUDAN PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY (SPLA).  WITH THE </p><p>RELIEF AGENCIES GONE, THE SUDANESE MILITARY COULD EMPLOY </p><p>IN THE CIVIL WAR ZONE SOME FIVE TONS OF "KHARDALAH" </p><p>(MUSTARD) GAS GIVEN TO SUDAN BY IRAQ.  (SEE COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>8.  MAHGOUB CONFIRMED THAT NIF LEADERS OFTEN MEET WITH </p><p>GEN. OMAR TO DISCUSS GOS POLICY.  MAHGOUB SAID THEY ALSO </p><p>MEET AS A GROUP TO COORDINATE THEIR VIEWS--OFTEN DURING </p><p>THE CURFEW PERIOD AT NIGHT TO AVOID OBSERVATION.  APART </p><p>FROM TURABI, THEY INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>-     MOHAMMED YOUSIF MOHAMMED, AN ATTORNEY AND FORMER </p><p>SPEAKER OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY (CA) NOW ACTIVE IN </p><p>THE ISLAMIC-AFRICAN RELIEF ORGANIZATION; </p><p> </p><p>-     ALI OSMAN MOHAMMED TAHA, NIF DEPUTY GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY; </p><p> </p><p>-     DR. IBRAHIM AHMED OMER, FORMER NIF DEPUTY IN THE CA </p><p>AND NOW HEAD OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION; </p><p> </p><p>-     DR. NAFI ALI NAFI, FORMER AGRICULTURE PROFESSOR AND </p><p>CURRENTLY A MAJOR FIGURE IN SUDANESE SECURITY; </p><p> </p><p>-     IBRAHIM SENUSSI, A MAJOR FIGURE IN THE NIF\'S MOTHER </p><p>ORGANIZATION, THE MOSLEM BROTHERS; </p><p> </p><p>-     AHMED SULEIMAN, FORMER COLUMNIST FOR THE NIF PARTY </p><p>PAPER "AL RAYA" ("THE PILLAR") AND NOW COLUMNIST IN TWO </p><p>GOS-CONTROLLED DAILIES; </p><p> </p><p>-     MOHAMMED MOHAMMED SADIQ AL KARORI, PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>HIGHER ADVISORY COUNCIL OF THE NIF; </p><p> </p><p>-     HAFIZ AS-SHEIKH ZAKI, CURRENTLY DEAN OF THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF KHARTOUM SCHOOL OF LAW; </p><p> </p><p>-     AHMAD MAHJOUB HAG NUR, AN INFLUENTIAL LEADER OF THE </p><p>NIF\'S RADICAL WING. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH NEVER CONFIRMED, ACCOUNTS OF </p><p>POSSESSION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY THE GOS HAVE BEEN RIFE </p><p>FOR YEARS.  INTELLIGENCE SOURCES DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>SAF, IF THEY HAVE CHEMICAL WEAPONS, I.E. MUSTARD GAS, </p><p>NAPALM, ARE CAPABLE OF MIXING THE CHEMICALS, STORING THEM </p><p>WITHOUT HARM TO THEMSELVES OR DELIVERING THEM TO AN </p><p>ENEMY.  GOS OBSTRUCTIONISM ON RELIEF, RECENTLY </p><p>ESCALATING, IS A MATTER OF RECORD.  MAHGOUB\'S COMMENTS </p><p>CONFIRM MANY PREVIOUS REPORTS (MOST NOTABLY IN REF B) </p><p>ABOUT THE DOMINANT ROLE OF THE NIF WITHIN THE GOS, </p><p>INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE OF NIF SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS AND </p><p>GEN. OMAR\'S CLOSE CONNECTIONS WITH THE NIF.  NIF LEADERS, </p><p>INCLUDING TURABI, NOW OPENLY AVOW THE IDENTITY BETWEEN </p><p>THEIR VIEWS AND THOSE OF THE GOS.  MANY OF THE NAMES ON </p><p>MAHGOUB\'S LIST HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN THE PAST AS MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE "COUNCIL OF FORTY," A SHADOWY GROUP WHICH </p><p>ALLEGEDLY HAS DIRECTED THE GOS SINCE THE JUNE 30, 1989 </p><p>COUP.  DETAILS ABOUT THE GROUP REMAIN ELUSIVE, BUT MOST </p><p>SUDANESE (INCLUDING OFFICIALS) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT </p><p>UNOFFICIAL SOURCES WIELD CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE. </p><p>TURABI\'S ALLEGED SECURITY ROLE INDICATES THAT THE </p><p>"REORGANIZATION" OF GOS SECURITY ORGANS SEVERAL MONTHS </p><p>AGO, WHICH STRIPPED THE RELATIVELY MODERATE BRIG. IBRAHIM </p><p>NAIL EIDAM OF HIS SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES, WAS INTENDED </p><p>TO BRING THAT SECTOR AS WELL UNDER GREATER NIF INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>O\'NEILL </p><p></p></div>
