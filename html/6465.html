<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 TEGUCIGALPA 000674 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA, WHA/CEN, EB, PM, OES, S/CT AND CA </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, EFIN, EAID, ETRD, KJUS, PREL, ELAB, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: ECONOMIC TOUR D\'HORIZON WITH HONDURAN MINISTER OF </p><p>THE PRESIDENCY LUIS COSENZA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR LARRY PALMER; REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a March 12 call on Honduran Minister of the </p><p>Presidency Luis Cosenza, DCM and Econcouns discussed the top </p><p>economic items on the bilateral agenda.  Cosenza committed to </p><p>campaigning for the repeal of the teacher and nurse </p><p>"estatutos" that have caused the rapid increase in government </p><p>expenditures over the past five years (and impeded the </p><p>attainment of an IMF program this year).  He expressed </p><p>interest in the Millenium Challenge Account, and in ways to </p><p>include incentives for new foreign investment in the Central </p><p>America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) negotiations.  DCM urged </p><p>rapid ratification of the ICC Article 98 Agreement and two </p><p>OAS counter-terrorism conventions, and a raft of important </p><p>economic legislation. Both sides agreed on the importance of </p><p>improvement to port security, Honduras\' investment climate </p><p>and the rule of law.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Bilateral and Regional Relationships </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) DCM expressed USG satisfaction with the March 11 </p><p>suspension by the Nicaraguan Congress of the 35 percent </p><p>retaliatory tariff and appreciation for Honduran restraint </p><p>over the past three years, indicating that the USG had been </p><p>quietly urging this move in the interest of integration. </p><p>Cosenza attributed much of the credit to Nicaraguan President </p><p>Bolanos.  Asked if he thought that the Honduran Congress </p><p>would proceed with the enactment of sanctions (and immediate </p><p>suspension) as some in the business community were urging, </p><p>Cosenza shook his head no.  He indicated that President </p><p>Maduro was advising against such a move; if the Nicaraguan </p><p>tariff were reinstated, the Honduran Congress could easily </p><p>enact countermeasures at that time. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Cosenza indicated that President Maduro will try to </p><p>meet with the IMF, World Bank and IDB on the margins of the </p><p>April 11 meeting of the Central American Presidents with </p><p>President Bush on CAFTA.  He asked for suggestions on other </p><p>meetings. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Negotiations with the IMF </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Asked about the status of fiscal measures needed to </p><p>reach agreement with the IMF on a new Poverty Reduction and </p><p>Growth Facility program, Cosenza replied that the package of </p><p>tax measures was ready and will be submitted in early April, </p><p>between the President\'s trips to Italy (which may now be off) </p><p>and Washington.  Emboffs complimented him on his clear </p><p>presentation on the need to repeal the wage and benefits </p><p>provisions of the special laws (called "estatutos") governing </p><p>teacher and medical worker pay.  Cosenza confirmed that the </p><p>GOH had concluded that this was absolutely necessary to </p><p>regain control over government finances and reach agreement </p><p>with the IMF, and had decided to fight as hard as possible to </p><p>attain this goal.  He noted that the move could come within </p><p>the next week; the GOH is currently discussing which estatuto </p><p>will be first.  Comment: The government may be working with </p><p>the Supreme Court to have the estatutos found </p><p>unconstitutional.  This would allow them to avoid the </p><p>difficult task of building </p><p>the needed consensus for repeal of the laws in the Congress. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Econcouns provided Cosenza with a copy of the </p><p>Embassy\'s March 10 notification to the Minister of Finance, </p><p>per instructions from Washington, that lack of payment of USD </p><p>12,000 on July 15 or USD 1.7 million on September 3 for debt </p><p>service on Department of Defense loans could trigger a </p><p>cessation of new USG foreign assistance under the Brooke </p><p>Amendment.  The looming debt service payment deadline was one </p><p>more important driver for reaching an agreement with the IMF </p><p>that would put the GOH back on the road to HIPC debt relief. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Millennium Challenge Account </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) DCM provided Cosenza with a copy of the fact sheet on </p><p>the Millennium Challenge Account program and outlined the </p><p>currently envisaged system of qualifying for MCA eligibility </p><p>and emphasized the importance of paying special attention to </p><p>measures that might help the GOH meet the good governance </p><p>criteria.  Cosenza expressed his appreciation for the </p><p>background on the program and indicated that the eligibility </p><p>criteria are all important issues that the GOH is already </p><p>working to address for the sake of the country\'s own </p><p>well-being.  He requested a list of the countries that are </p><p>likely to be considered for eligibility during the first year </p><p>of the program, in order to start getting an idea of how </p><p>Honduras compares to its low-income peers. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Agriculture Issues </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) DCM noted that there would be a decision on Honduras\'s </p><p>request for wheat under the Food for Progress Program </p><p>shortly.  If Honduras is approved, it will be important for </p><p>the Ministry of Agriculture (SAG) and USDA  to work closely </p><p>on a agreement on the use of the local currency proceeds from </p><p>the sale of the wheat.  Cosenza asked if the funds could be </p><p>used for low-income housing.  Econcouns explained that they </p><p>are more commonly used for agricultural projects.  She took </p><p>the opportunity to emphasize the importance of completion of </p><p>the last major USDA-SAG project, the transfer of the mango </p><p>hot-water treatment plant in Comayagua to an association of </p><p>mango producers.  She explained that the legislation creating </p><p>this association had been stalled in Congress and that </p><p>Emboffs had been talking to the Minister of Agriculture about </p><p>the importance of completion of the transfer.  Cosenza </p><p>promised to look into it. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>CAFTA </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Econcouns gave an overview of the current status of </p><p>the Central American Free Trade Agreement negotiations and </p><p>asked about GOH plans to build up the permanent, technical </p><p>trade policy staff.  Cosenza said that the GOH is supporting </p><p>Minister of Industry and Trade Norman Garcia\'s efforts to </p><p>hire and train negotiators and reiterated his strong belief </p><p>that the only way to keep well-trained negotiators after a </p><p>change in administration would be to create a non-political </p><p>public-private institute.  He discounted the possibility that </p><p>Congressional approval of a Civil Service law would prevent </p><p>large-scale turnover in government agencies after the next </p><p>election; Cosenza acknowledged that the law would be an </p><p>important step, but emphasized that it would take time to </p><p>change the political culture. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Econcouns noted that there would be sensitivities on </p><p>agriculture on both sides, but that the two countries could </p><p>work together in the WTO toward the goal of reducing trade </p><p>distorting subsidies without affecting the USG\'s ability to </p><p>implement food aid and agricultural credit programs that are </p><p>available to countries like Honduras. She confirmed that the </p><p>Embassy is working closely with the Trade Ministry to </p><p>identify areas in which cooperation in the WTO negotiations </p><p>would be particularly helpful, such as the TRIPS moratorium, </p><p>the agriculture negotiations and the services talks. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Econcouns also mentioned that during the course of </p><p>the negotiations, the USG will be warning the Central </p><p>Americans that some issues can not bend because of their </p><p>importance to gaining U.S. congressional ratification for an </p><p>eventual CAFTA, such as compliance with labor and environment </p><p>language in the Trade Promotion Authority legislation.  The </p><p>GOH can expect that some of the trade rule chapters may </p><p>require changes to Honduran legislation. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Cosenza asked about the possibility of including in </p><p>the CAFTA a provision allowing U.S. investors to deduct </p><p>income taxes paid in Honduras from their U.S. tax returns </p><p>(thus allowing the GOH to start levying income tax on these </p><p>maquila companies).  Econcouns explained that the Treasury </p><p>Department is the key contact for discussion of a prospective </p><p>Double Taxation treaty.  The GOH could forward a request </p><p>directly to Treasury (and she had provided this information </p><p>to the Ministry of Finance previously).  She also explained </p><p>that in considering these requests, Treasury places priority </p><p>on those countries that the U.S. private sector has </p><p>identified as important.  As far as the elimination of the </p><p>Honduran income tax exemptions for companies located in free </p><p>zones, Econcouns noted that it was generally the </p><p>Honduran-owned maquila companies (comprising about 40-50 </p><p>percent of the textile and apparel firms in Honduras) that </p><p>have pushed for maintenance of these tax incentives. </p><p>Investment incentives will be an importa </p><p>nt topic of negotiation in the CAFTA talks.  Cosenza then </p><p>backtracked and expressed the GOH\'s view that continued </p><p>maintenance of the free zones would be important to keeping </p><p>the textile and apparel industry in Central America. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Cosenza also asked about the possibility of the </p><p>inclusion of tax incentives by the USG for U.S. companies to </p><p>invest in Honduras and other Central American companies, </p><p>along the lines of incentives provided for Puerto Rico (an </p><p>apparent reference to Section 936 exemptions from federal </p><p>taxes for Puerto Rican based subsidiaries of U.S. companies). </p><p> He talked at length about the importance of a CAFTA </p><p>agreement that promotes additional investment so that it does </p><p>not just represent at the end another broken dream. </p><p>Econcouns countered that U.S. companies who critique the </p><p>investment climate in Honduras never mention the need for tax </p><p>incentives - instead they point to issues such as the high </p><p>cost telecommunications and energy, the weak judicial system, </p><p>crime, and regulatory and administrative delays.  Cosenza was </p><p>adamant that the GOH will be seeking some type of foreign </p><p>investment incentive program from the USG in the context of </p><p>the CAFTA negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Investment Climate, Commercial Disputes and Needed Legislation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Continuing the discussion on needed improvements in </p><p>the investment climate, DCM commented on the impressive </p><p>presentation made by Vice President Vicente Williams on March </p><p>11 during the rollout of the Competitiveness Council\'s </p><p>workplan.  An important element affecting the investment </p><p>climate is the relatively weak judiciary.  The DCM thanked </p><p>Cosenza for the government and Supreme Court\'s help in </p><p>pushing for resolution of outstanding commercial disputes. </p><p>Post saw a number of cases resolved in late 2002, although </p><p>there had been significant backsliding in three of the cases </p><p>in early 2003.  The DCM also emphasized that no progress had </p><p>been made to date in arbitration of outstanding Amcit land </p><p>disputes involving the Honduran government or municipalities. </p><p> Econcouns reminded Cosenza that the GOH had adopted a law </p><p>allowing the state to engage in arbitration in selected cases </p><p>during a short window of six months.  As the law went into </p><p>effect on January 16, there are only approximately four </p><p>months left to make of </p><p>fers to the Amcit claimants.  Cosenza indicated that he would </p><p>look into the issue. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The DCM mentioned pending legislation that we see as </p><p>important.  On the economic side, these include passage of </p><p>the civil service reform law, a civil aviation law, </p><p>restructuring of the telecommunications and power sectors, </p><p>creation of a unified land registry, and the legislation </p><p>creating the mango plant association.  On the political side, </p><p>the DCM emphasized the critical importance of ratification of </p><p>ICC Article 98 Agreement and two pending OAS conventions on </p><p>counter-terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Port Security </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Emboffs also emphasized the importance of vastly </p><p>improved port security, in the post September 11 environment. </p><p> They urged Cosenza to ensure that the GOH prepares the </p><p>country\'s ports over the next year to meet new legislation </p><p>for maritime traffic to the U.S., even if this requires </p><p>partial or total concession of port operation and security </p><p>functions.  Cosenza responded that the GOH is fully committed </p><p>to doing so, and in fact do hope to concession Puerto Cortes </p><p>during this administration.  The Customs Service is currently </p><p>working on the purchase of container X-ray equipment that </p><p>will be used to scan both incoming and outgoing containers. </p><p>He took on board Emboffs comments about the importance of </p><p>also strengthening port perimeter security and creation of an </p><p>independent security force. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>Roatan </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Econcouns summarized the diverse problems that Post </p><p>is seeing on the island of Roatan, including egregious land </p><p>disputes, lack of arrests in Amcit murder cases, drug </p><p>trafficking, flouting of U.S. fishing laws, and lack of </p><p>environmental enforcement.  She acknowledged that the rule of </p><p>law has traditionally been weak in the Bay Islands but </p><p>explained that the treatment of Amcits in Roatan is becoming </p><p>intolerable; Consenza indicated that he concurred. </p><p>She explained that there had been no progress to date in the </p><p>Moore land case and at the same time, she noted, the </p><p>islanders are benefiting from U.S. dollars in a variety of </p><p>ways - tourism, real estate tax revenues, fishery exports to </p><p>the U.S. and dockings by U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) Cosenza, fairly frankly, discussed the wide-ranging </p><p>challenges they faced in improving the rule of law in the </p><p>islands.  He noted that the USG perhaps has the strongest </p><p>leverage of all, such as our ability to deny or revoke visas </p><p>for presumption of illegal activity and capacity to invoke </p><p>sanctions for violations of U.S. laws such as the TEDS/shrimp </p><p>decertification.  Cosenza indicated that the GOH would </p><p>understand if the USG takes targeted moves, and asked only </p><p>that we not harm the reputation of the country or cut off </p><p>U.S. tourism.  DCM noted that we will stay in close touch on </p><p>these issues. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Comment: The discussion was cordial and relaxed, and </p><p>provided a good opportunity to ensure that President\'s top </p><p>staff is aware of the top economic issues on the USG\'s </p><p>agenda. Cosenza appeared sincerely intent on tackling the </p><p>estatutos, one of the major reasons for the GOH\'s structural </p><p>and growing budget deficit.  Although he had received </p><p>briefing material on the Millennium Challenge Account from </p><p>the Honduran Ambassador in Washington, he appreciated the </p><p>opportunity to discuss the envisioned process in greater </p><p>detail.  The discussion also gave Emboffs an opportunity to </p><p>focus on the Honduran need to make stronger efforts on good </p><p>governance and anti-corruption.  The GOH, if found eligible, </p><p>can be expected to make MCA proposals for large </p><p>infrastructure projects and funding of low-income housing. </p><p>Cosenza also seemed sincerely interested in improving port </p><p>security in order to assure Puerto Cortes\' continued </p><p>importance for shipping between the U.S. and the isthmus. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) Comment continued: Cosenza\'s push for USG incentives </p><p>for companies investing in Central America reflects the lack </p><p>of understanding in the Honduran government of U.S. trade </p><p>policy and sensitivities in the U.S. about claims that trade </p><p>agreements lead to an export of jobs.  In the discussions </p><p>about the investment climate and Roatan, he expressed the </p><p>GOH\'s frustration with their inability to make more rapid </p><p>progress in changing the status quo.  Embassy will continue </p><p>to urge the GOH to focus on the details of the CAFTA </p><p>negotiations, including the trade capacity building </p><p>discussions, and to move on reforms that will improve the </p><p>investment climate in Honduras (including moving on long </p><p>standing investment and commercial disputes).  We will also </p><p>continue to encourage the Hondurans to be more active in </p><p>support of our mutual interests in the FTAA and WTO </p><p>negotiations.  End Comment. </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
