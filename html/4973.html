<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 OTTAWA 000035 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>JCS FOR J-5 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPKO, PREL, MASS, CA, UK, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S./CANADA/U.K. TRILATERAL PEACEKEEPING MEETING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) The U.S. participated in annual talks on peacekeeping </p><p>with Canada and U.K. in Ottawa on December 10-11, 2002 in </p><p>which a broad range of peacekeeping issues were addressed. </p><p>Canada\'s Director General of International Security, </p><p>Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade </p><p>(DFAIT), Jill Sinclair, welcomed U.S. and U.K. participants </p><p>and made opening remarks.  Canada\'s chairperson for the </p><p>talks, Barbara Martin, Director, Regional Security and </p><p>Peacekeeping Division, DFAIT/IDC, made additional welcoming </p><p>comments and kicked off the discussions.  The discussions </p><p>addressed several ongoing UN peacekeeping missions and a </p><p>number of other topics related to current peacekeeping </p><p>issues.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Civil-Military Cooperation </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Participants agreed that impartial civil-military </p><p>cooperation is essential to bringing peacekeeping operations </p><p>to a successful conclusion.  Military operations achieve </p><p>little beyond temporary ceasefires.  Creating the conditions </p><p>for a more durable peace and the exit of military </p><p>participants requires the involvement of a wide range of </p><p>civilian actors from the UN, NGOs, and civil society. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Civilian players should be involved in early planning </p><p>along with military planners.  Civilian liaison personnel </p><p>should be co-located with military units, both at </p><p>headquarters and in the field.  Civilian-military operation </p><p>centers should be established.  Civilian-military cooperation </p><p>at the highest levels is essential to ensure unity of purpose </p><p>and to ensure that headquarters and field operations </p><p>implement civilian-military cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Participants agreed that cooperation between the UN </p><p>Secretariat and other UN agencies through the Administration </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Coordination Committee (ACC) should be encouraged and that </p><p>the use of Integrated Management Task Forces (IMTF) at UN </p><p>headquarters in New York be complemented by the formulation </p><p>of parallel structures in UN field operations. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Responsibility to Protect </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Canada summarized the Report of the International </p><p>Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty which </p><p>examined the question of when, if ever, it is appropriate for </p><p>states to use force against another state simply to protect </p><p>at-risk inhabitants of that other state.  U.S. head of </p><p>delegation Will Imbrie noted that the report raises important </p><p>issues for authorization for intervention in humanitarian </p><p>crises.  He said the challenge is to make the link between </p><p>theory and practice, thus closing the gap between think-tank </p><p>types and operators. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Overview of Selected UN Peacekeeping Operations </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Participants discussed the current state of affairs </p><p>and way forward for three UN peacekeeping operations: the UN </p><p>Observer Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC), </p><p>the UN Assistance Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), and the </p><p>UN Mission in East Timor (UNMISET). </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) MONUC: Participants acknowledged the unique </p><p>opportunity at hand, but noted several significant challenges </p><p>ahead.  The redeployment of forces from surrounding nations </p><p>is a very positive development which the international </p><p>community should take advantage of.  The Security Council </p><p>decision to increase the troop ceiling to 8,700 was </p><p>appropriate, as were the safeguards imposed to ensure the </p><p>second task force is not deployed before it is actually </p><p>needed.  Several challenges remain: the issue of third </p><p>country settlement; addressing the remaining hardcore </p><p>fighters that do not want to disarm; selection of a new SRSG </p><p>and appointment of capable assistants; and review of the UN </p><p>policy on HIV-AIDS to reduce the threat of spreading the </p><p>virus through UN peacekeepers. </p><p>8. (SBU) UNAMSIL: The U.K. reviewed progress since the </p><p>elections and believes that UNAMSIL can end in mid-2004. </p><p>Further work is needed to develop Sierra Leone police forces </p><p>and the Sierra Leone Army, establish control over the diamond </p><p>producing areas, and reintegrate former fighters into the </p><p>economy.  The U.K. continues to conduct military training </p><p>under the International Military Assistance Training Team </p><p>(IMATT) program and exercise its over-the-horizon force with </p><p>regular joint exercises, a practice to be continued after </p><p>UNAMSIL\'s exit.  The U.K. also continues to provide police </p><p>training.  The U.K. noted the need to strengthen security </p><p>measures when the Special Court issues indictments. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) UNMISET - Timor Leste: The U.K. reviewed </p><p>developments in Timor-Leste, noting that the police and </p><p>justice sectors still require significant work.  Recent riots </p><p>in Dili signal problems in the security sector and weakness </p><p>in the Timor-Leste Police. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Situation in Burundi </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Despite the recent signing of a ceasefire agreement </p><p>by one faction of the FDD, there was consensus that the </p><p>situation in Burundi is not right for a UN peacekeeping </p><p>operation.  Imbrie stressed that while the ceasefire </p><p>signatories have requested a peacekeeping force, the </p><p>ceasefire is by no means comprehensive and that the U.S. </p><p>could not support a Chapter VII mission, stating that </p><p>"deploying a mission under the current circumstances would </p><p>put peacekeepers in a live fire situation."  He noted that </p><p>the U.S. had consulted with the U.K. and France on potential </p><p>contingency operations in the event of a mass genocide </p><p>scenario, but none are prepared to commit at this point, and </p><p>all would prefer an intervention force from African nations </p><p>with possible support from developed nations. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Speaking for the U.K. delegation, Mr. Stephen </p><p>Pollard, Head of Overseas Secretariat, MOD, responded that </p><p>Britain was reluctant to take on a new mission at this time, </p><p>citing manpower and budgetary constraints.  He stated that </p><p>the UK could provide "small scale" support to a mission in </p><p>areas such as logistics or command and control.  He noted </p><p>that South Africa, Ghana, and Senegal were prepared to </p><p>provide forces for a mission, but only under a U.S.-supported </p><p>UN mission, after a comprehensive ceasefire had been </p><p>achieved, and with assurances that a feasible evacuation plan </p><p>was in place. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>SHIRBRIG Update </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Colonel Gaston Cote, Director of Peacekeeping Policy, </p><p>Canadian Department of National Defense, provided an overview </p><p>of the Standby High Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG).  Colonel </p><p>Cote noted that SHIRBRIG is the only operationally ready </p><p>brigade-sized unit exclusively available for United Nations </p><p>deployment.  The unit has about 5,000 troops that can deploy </p><p>up to six months under a Chapter VI mandate.  Brigade </p><p>elements are on call, but  planning element consisting of the </p><p>Commanding General, Chief of Staff, and section heads is </p><p>permanently stationed in Denmark.  The Brigade participates </p><p>in two exercises per year with either the UN or the planning </p><p>element developing the scenario.  The headquarters has an </p><p>objective of deploying within 14 days of notification.  The </p><p>remaining units of the brigade have an objective of deploying </p><p>within 30 days of national approval. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Canada will assume presidency of the SHIRBRIG </p><p>steering committee in January 2003.  Key agenda items for </p><p>their presidency will be to: focus on prospective new members </p><p>(Chile, Brazil, Senegal), strengthen the rapid reaction </p><p>capability of the brigade, foster better communications </p><p>between SHIRBRIG, individual states and international </p><p>organizations, and include civilian personnel (humanitarian </p><p>assistance) in the planning element or incorporate them in </p><p>the on-call list.  Members also intend to more actively </p><p>promote SHIRBRIG as a model for regional organizations. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Building African Peacekeeping Capacity </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Delegations presented update briefings on respective </p><p>initiatives to enhance African capacity for supporting peace </p><p>operations.  The U.S. discussed the African Contingency </p><p>Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program and </p><p>reviewed accomplishments under the African Crisis Response </p><p>Initiative (ACRI) and Operation Focus Relief (OFR).  The U.K. </p><p>gave an update on the IMATT initiative, and Canada presented </p><p>information about ongoing efforts in the G8 to promote </p><p>African peacekeeping capacity.  Participants agreed on the </p><p>need to more closely coordinate respective efforts to ensure </p><p>efficiency and avoid giving African countries "confusing </p><p>signals." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Peacekeeping Reform - Brahimi Implementation </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The group was unanimous that implementation of </p><p>peacekeeping reform measures was not "a done deal" and that </p><p>we should work together to keep attention focused on </p><p>implementation efforts.  The U.K. delegation drove the point </p><p>home with an exceptionally detailed statement outlining </p><p>numerous areas where much work remains to be done. Key points </p><p>included the importance of monitoring the UN Secretariat, </p><p>particularly DPKO, to ensure new posts are being used </p><p>effectively; continuing to improve the working relationships </p><p>between troop contributors, the Security Council, and the </p><p>Secretariat; improving the inter-relationships between </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>departments/agencies; and improving UN capacity for complex </p><p>peacekeeping.  The group responded favorably to suggestions </p><p>from the U.S. for a mid-term review of DPKO by Logistics </p><p>Management Incorporated (LMI) and establishment of a "Friends </p><p>of DPKO" group in New York to accomplish these goals. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Security Sector Reform - Case Study: Afghanistan </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Col. Baltazar of OSD/SOLIC/Stability Operations led </p><p>the discussion, focusing on development of the Afghan </p><p>National Army (ANA) and Ministry of Defense.  He gave the </p><p>current U.S. thinking that about eight years would be needed </p><p>to develop a civilian-controlled military capable of securing </p><p>Afghanistan\'s borders and ensuring government control of all </p><p>the territory within those borders.  He stated that the most </p><p>immediate challenge is funding.  Current estimates hold that </p><p>$1.84 billion is required to establish the envisioned </p><p>70,000-strong ANA and Border Control forces.  Baltazar noted </p><p>that only $50 million is available now, and pledges from </p><p>other countries have not been forthcoming.  Recruiting and </p><p>retention to achieve an ethnically-balanced force and </p><p>ultimately displace the warlord system was noted as an even </p><p>longer term challenge. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) UKUN delegate Glyn Berry said upcoming elections </p><p>could be problematic if, as expected, they result in a </p><p>majority Tajik and fundamentalist government which would be </p><p>difficult for the Pashtun population to accept.  He </p><p>underscored the importance of ensuring ethnic balance in the </p><p>force, and of ANA ability to "outbid" competing employers </p><p>(warlords and drug traffickers) for soldiers.  He also raised </p><p>the issue of DDR, noting that viable employment opportunities </p><p>were required for those mujahideen not selected for the ANA </p><p>to keep them from returning to their old ways. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) The U.K.\'s Pollard resumed the discussion, stating </p><p>U.K. willingness to assist by providing niche skills and </p><p>other capabilities not resident in the U.S. plan.  As an </p><p>example, the U.K. will provide an officer to the UN </p><p>Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) to advise Brahimi </p><p>on security sector reform and assist in development of a </p><p>National Security Council to integrate the various aspects of </p><p>reform.  On the issue of funding, he noted that the U.K. had </p><p>set aside 10 million pounds to support ANA salary payments, </p><p>but that release of the funds was conditioned on the size, </p><p>shape and ethnic balance of the ANA, as well as other </p><p>reforms. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Future of Complex Peacekeeping </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) Major General Cam Ross, Director General of </p><p>International Security Policy for the Canadian Department of </p><p>National Defense, presented Canada\'s view on the issue of </p><p>whether future complex peacekeeping operations would be </p><p>conducted by the UN or multinational coalitions.  General </p><p>Ross contrasted pre- and post-cold war trends of </p><p>peacekeeping, noting the shift from fewer interstate and more </p><p>intrastate conflicts.  He highlighted the UN\'s important and </p><p>unique role in both scenarios and concluded that UN </p><p>peacekeeping would continue to perform a key role in future </p><p>peacekeeping requirements. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>CIVPOL - Transition to Local Police Forces </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) The U.S. noted that along with the exit of UN </p><p>Civilian Police (CIVPOL), there will often be a need for a </p><p>follow-on mechanism to complete improvements initiated by the </p><p>UN.  As an example, the European Union Police Mission (EUPM) </p><p>is on track to assume the IPTF mission in January 2003; a </p><p>similar mechanism will be needed in Timor-Leste after </p><p>UNMISET\'s exit.  CIVPOL only addresses one portion of the </p><p>justice system.  Other parts, such as laws, courts, judges, </p><p>prosecutors, defense lawyers, and jails, will likely need </p><p>continuing development in post-conflict situations. </p><p>Peacekeeping operations are ill-suited to address such </p><p>long-term development tasks. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Role of the UNSC Working Group/Consultations with TCCs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>21. (U) Participants noted that a positive and effective </p><p>relationship between Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs), the </p><p>Secretariat and the Security Council is a worthwhile </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>objective and agreed to continue working toward improvements. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>22. (U) In closing, Canada suggested the possibility of </p><p>expanding the trilateral forum to include other countries. </p><p>Australia was specifically mentioned as a potential prospect. </p><p> Participants agreed to consider the proposal and discuss </p><p>this further at a later date.  Delegates from respective </p><p>missions to the UN were encouraged to conduct a "trial" of </p><p>this concept in New York.  The U.S. announced its intention </p><p>to host the talks in early December 2003 and said a proposed </p><p>agenda would be on the table for review by mid-October 2003. </p><p>GALLAGHER </p><p></p></div>
