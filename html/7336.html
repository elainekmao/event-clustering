Under headline "Give Iraqis the peace they </p><p>      deserve" the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" </p><p>      used its April 10 editorial to accuse the United States </p><p>      and Britain of "butchering" journalists "at will" in </p><p>      the ongoing war to free Iraq.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "A bloodbath of calamitous proportions is taking </p><p>      its toll on Iraqi citizens. . .in the ongoing illegal </p><p>      war in the Gulf. . .  While the Americans and British </p><p>      have continued to celebrate the success of their air </p><p>      strikes, what they fail to notice is that the rest of </p><p>      the world is restless, and the anger is building up </p><p>      against the two countries\' leaders over their open </p><p>      defiance of all nations of the world just to build up </p><p>      their egos. . .  While some of the newspapers openly </p><p>      supported the attack on Iraq, no one should celebrate </p><p>      the death of journalists, though their deaths should </p><p>      save as a wake-up call to the countries involved in the </p><p>      war. . .   The same Americans and British are always </p><p>      singing and chastising other countries over their </p><p>      treatment of journalists that they are butchering at </p><p>      will in the Gulf. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
