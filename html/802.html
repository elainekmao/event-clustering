<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RIYADH 005221 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR TUELLER </p><p>PARIS FOR ALLEGRONE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356: DECL:  11/30/15 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINS, SA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SAUDI ARABIA:  WHAT IF THE KING REMAINS </p><p>          INCAPICITATED? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) RIYADH 5218; (B) RIYADH 5219 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.  CLASSIFIED BY DCM </p><p>THEODORE KATTOUF - 1.5 B,D. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE CURRENT MEDICAL PROGNOSIS FOR KING FAHD, </p><p>ALBEIT INCOMPLETE AND TENTATIVE, SUGGESTS THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF MEDIUM-TERM OR EVEN PROLONGED RECOVERY </p><p>FROM WHAT IS DESCRIBED DEFINITIVELY BY OUR MEDICAL </p><p>SOURCES AS A STROKE.  AT THIS STAGE, WITHIN HOURS OF </p><p>FAHD ENTERING THE HOSPITAL, THE KING\'S CONDITION DOES </p><p>NOT REPEAT NOT APPEAR IMMEDIATELY LIFE-THREATENING </p><p>(ALTHOUGH IT COULD LATER MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION). </p><p>INDEED, OUR RMO ALSO NOTES THAT RAPID AND FULL RECOVERY, </p><p>EVEN WITHIN A DAY OR TWO, IS ALSO ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. THE </p><p>KING\'S PERSONAL SECRETARY STRONGLY IMPLIED IN A CALL TO </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR THAT SUCH AN UPBEAT PROGNOSIS IS </p><p>WARRANTED (SEE REF B). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ASSUMING, HOWEVER, THAT SOME DEGREE OF </p><p>INCAPACITATION PERSISTS, PERHAPS OVER A PERIOD OF WEEKS, </p><p>THE ISSUE OF ITS IMPACT ON DECISION-MAKING AND ON </p><p>INTERNAL DYNAMICS WITHIN THE AL SAUD MUST BE FACED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ASSUMING THAT FAHD DOES NOT SHOW IMMEDIATE SIGNS </p><p>OF FULL RECOVERY WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS, THE </p><p>COUNCIL OF ELDERS, CONSISTING OF THE MEMBERS OF THE AL </p><p>SAUD AND MOSTLY OF THE SENIOR SURVIVING SONS OF ABDUL </p><p>AZIZ, WILL LIKELY GATHER INFORMALLY AND QUIETLY TO </p><p>ASSESS THE KING\'S CONDITION.  THEY WILL BE MOTIVATED TO </p><p>PROJECT AN AURA OF STABILITY, CONTINUITY, FAMILY UNITY, </p><p>AND CONTINUED LOYALTY TO KING FAHD.  ALMOST CERTAINLY, </p><p>THE IMMEDIATE CONSENSUS WILL BE THAT CROWN PRINCE </p><p>ABDULLAH SHOULD BE ASKED TO ACT IN THE NAME OF THE </p><p>KING.  SENIOR ULEMA, THE OTHER PILLAR OF THE SAUDI </p><p>REGIME, ARE LIKELY TO TACITLY AGREE.  THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>MINISTERS, COMPOSED PARTLY OF NONROYALS, WILL NOT PLAY A </p><p>ROLE IN ANY DECISION THAT IS REACHED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) OUTSIDE THE FAMILY CONSULTATIONS, THE SAG IS </p><p>LIKELY TO KEEP MEDIA REPORTS AND SPECULATION ABOUT THE </p><p>KING\'S HEALTH TO A MINIMUM.  POSITIVE BULLETINS ARE </p><p>LIKELY TO BE STANDARD FARE.  WE CAN ALSO EXPECT EVEN </p><p>MORE STEPPED-UP SECURITY PRECAUTIONS AT PUBLIC BUILDINGS </p><p>AND IN THE COUNTRY GENERALLY, IN A BID TO MINIMIZE </p><p>CHANCES OF A SECOND TERRORIST ATTACK OR OTHER POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE IN A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WEEKS, ASSUMING </p><p>FAHD\'S CONDITION REMAINS STABLE, ABDULLAH IS UNLIKELY TO </p><p>BE DESIGNATED AS REGENT, IF ONLY BECAUSE THE ONLY </p><p>PRECEDENT FOR THE NEW SITUATION IS THE FAMILY\'S DECISION </p><p>TO TRANSFER KING SAUD\'S POWERS TO CP FAYSAL AS REGENT IN </p><p>1964.  THE CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SITUATIONS </p><p>IS THAT SAUD WAS REMOVED BECAUSE OF INCOMPETENCE AND NOT </p><p>FOR REASONS OF PHYSICAL INCAPACITY.  CROWN PRINCE </p><p>ABDULLAH REGULARLY CHAIRS THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND </p><p>HAS LONG BEEN PROJECTED TO THE NATION, AND TREATED, AS </p><p>THE CLEARLY ESTABLISHED NO. TWO BEHIND THE KING.  WE </p><p>HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD NOT EFFECTIVELY </p><p>STEP FORWARD, WITH FULL FAMILY BACKING, AT THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ADDING TO THE INNATE CONSERVATISM OF THE AL SAUD </p><p>AND THE FAMILY\'S LONG TRADITION OF MAINTAINING COHESION </p><p>AND SOLIDARITY WILL BE CONCERN WITH TH SECURITY </p><p>ENVIRONMENT FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER 13 OMBING ATTACK ON </p><p>OPM/SANG.  BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN WIDELY VIEWED AS AN </p><p>ATTACK ON THE REGIME AS MUCH AS ON THE U.S., THE SENIOR </p><p>PRINCES WILL BE FURTHER ENCOURAGED TO AVOID ANY </p><p>APPEARANCE OF DISUNITY BY DEVIATING FROM THE ESTABLISHED </p><p>LINE OF AUTHORITY OR SUCCESSION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) IN SUM, IN THE SHORT TERM (DEFINED AS OVER THE </p><p>NEXT 30 OR SO DAYS), WE ANTICIPATE A SMOOTH AND PEACEFUL </p><p>EMPHASIS ON MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO. </p><p>DECISION-MAKING, NEVER A RAPID PROCESS IN SAUDI ARABIA, </p><p>MAY SLOW DOWN CONSIDERABLY, ESPECIALLY AS ABDULLAH WILL </p><p>CAREFULLY AVOID ANY SIGN OF PRESUMING FAHD\'S PERMANENT </p><p>REMOVAL FROM OFFICE OR BY INAPPROPRIATELY ACTING AS IF </p><p>HE WERE KING. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) LOOKING AHEAD FURTHER THAN A MONTH, THE KING\'S </p><p>ACTUAL MEDICAL CONDITION WILL DETERMINE WHAT DECISIONS </p><p>THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS WILL TAKE.  A PROGNOSIS OF A SLOW </p><p>BUT SURE RECOVERY OF FAHD\'S FACULTIES WILL UNDOUBTEDLY </p><p>LEAD THE ELDERS TO CONCUR IN THE NEW STATUS QUO.  A </p><p>PROGNOSIS OF PROLONGED OR PERMANENT INCAPACITATION WOULD </p><p>FORCE THE COUNCIL, I.E. THE AL SAUD, TO THEN ADDRESS THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF ACTUAL SUCCESSION.  AT THIS </p><p>JUNCTURE, WE HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE PRIME OBJECTIVE </p><p>AGAIN WILL BE TO PROJECT AN IMAGE OF CONTROL, STABILITY, </p><p>AND CONTINUITY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) SHOULD FAHD\'S MEDICAL CONDITION DETERIORATE AND </p><p>HE DIE, THE INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM OUTLINED ABOVE WOULD </p><p>ALSO COME INTO PLAY.  UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE ROLE </p><p>OF THE ULEMA MIGHT BE MORE VISIBLY ENHANCED AS THE NEW </p><p>KING - CP ABDULLAH RAISED TO THE THRONE - WOULD REQUIRE </p><p>THEIR FORMAL SANCTION.  IN A SENSE, THE KING\'S DEATH, </p><p>WHILE PRECIPITATING COMPLEX SCENARIOS OF POWER TRANSFER </p><p>TO CP ABDULLAH AND SPECULATION ABOUT WHO WILL FOLLOW </p><p>ABDULLAH, WOULD BE SIMPLER, IF ONLY BECAUSE THE CURRENT </p><p>LINE OF SUCCESSION IS SO WELL ESTABLISHED.  WE SEE </p><p>LITTLE CHANCE THAT THE CP COULD OR WOULD BE PUSHED </p><p>ASIDE; NOR, IN FACT, DO WE BELIEVE THAT MINDEF SULTAN, </p><p>CURRENTLY THIRD IN LINE TO THE THRONE, WOULD MAKE SUCH A </p><p>PLAY.  EVEN LESS LIKELY WOULD BE AN ATTEMPT BY ANOTHER </p><p>PRINCE - WHETHER ANOTHER SON OF ABDUL AZIZ OR A GRANDSON </p><p>- TO SECURE POWER. </p><p> </p><p>MABUS </p><p></p></div>
