(SBU)  Summary:  European Central Bank (ECB) senior </p><p>officials do not foresee any obstacles to Jean-Claude </p><p>Trichet becoming the next President of the European </p><p>Central Bank.  Finance Ministers are scheduled to make </p><p>their official recommendation at the Ecofin meeting on </p><p>July 15.  The ECB Governing Council and Parliament will </p><p>then be consulted and give their opinions.  Final </p><p>approval by heads of state should take place at the </p><p>European Council on October 16-17.  Trichet is expected </p><p>to be in office by the end of October, early November. </p><p>End Summary </p><p> </p><p>Thessaloniki Council Jumps the Gun </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  The Presidency\'s conclusions of European </p><p>Council meeting of June 19-20 in Thessaloniki  states </p><p>that the Heads of State or Government "have decided on </p><p>the candidacy of Jean-Claude Trichet for the presidency </p><p>of the European Central Bank."  They went on to "invite </p><p>the Council (ECOFIN)," at its next session, to initiate </p><p>the necessary procedures under the Treaty. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  While this was a clear political signal, a </p><p>senior ECB official points out that the Council got a </p><p>bit ahead of itself.  Under the Treaty the ECOFIN has </p><p>the responsibility to take the initiative for </p><p>recommending a new ECB president.  The Council\'s </p><p>conclusions have no binding effect. </p><p> </p><p>Appointment Process and Schedule </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  According to the ECB official, at the July 15 </p><p>Ecofin meeting Finance Ministers should make their </p><p>recommendation for Trichet to become the next ECB </p><p>President.  Under Article 11 of the ECB\'s statutes, </p><p>before this recommendation goes to the Heads of State </p><p>or Government for a decision, the Governing Council of </p><p>the ECB and the European Parliament have to be </p><p>consulted.  Both issue non-binding opinions. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) There had been some discussion that the </p><p>Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (EMAC) of the </p><p>Parliament would hold a special hearing in July, </p><p>according to the ECB official.  However, he reports </p><p>that EMAC decided that no special session was necessary </p><p>and will hold its hearing in the second half of </p><p>September (Note: EMAC has sessions scheduled for </p><p>September 10 and 30).  The hearing will afford an </p><p>opportunity for committee members to pose questions to </p><p>Trichet. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Given the timing of the anticipated Ecofin </p><p>recommendation and the EMAC hearing, the Governing </p><p>Council of the ECB would render its opinion either at </p><p>its meeting on July 31 or its August 21 session.  Heads </p><p>of State or Government at the October 16-17 European </p><p>Council meeting could then give their formal </p><p>endorsement. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  According to this ECB official, Trichet </p><p>should be able to be in the ECB\'s President\'s office in </p><p>late October, early November.  He said, "No obstacles </p><p>are foreseen in this process." </p><p> </p><p>8.
