<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 008380 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S NEW FOREIGN MINISTER: YASAR YAKIS </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Turkey\'s 58th government, announced Nov. 18, includes </p><p>former career diplomat and three-time ambassador Yasar </p><p>(Yashar) Yakis (Yah-kish) as Foreign Minister.  Bio below. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A mostly conventionally-minded, retired 39-year </p><p>veteran of the MFA, Yakis is now AK Vice Chairman for foreign </p><p>affairs.  He not in the inner circle of AK Chairman Erdogan\'s </p><p>advisors; according to a number of younger AK officials, some </p><p>of them among Erdogan\'s closer advisors, Erdogan considers </p><p>Yakis useful as a barbarian handler/liaison to the Kemalist </p><p>foreign policy establishment but will keep his own counsel; </p><p>indeed, Erdogan has now appointed as his foreign policy </p><p>advisor Egemen Bagis, who spent 17 years in the U.S. and is </p><p>intimately familiar with, and a promoter of, the American way </p><p>of doing things. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Yakis was born 1938 in Akcakoca on the Black Sea.  Of </p><p>Laz extraction (an ethnic minority related to Georgians; </p><p>known for their mixture of cleverness and otherworldly sense </p><p>of humor and often the butt of jokes by other Turks). </p><p>Graduated from Ankara U. Political Science Faculty, which at </p><p>the time was the premier institution for training high civil </p><p>servants and a bastion of Kemalism.  Entered the Turkish </p><p>Diplomatic Service 1962.  Served in the following positions </p><p>until 1988: Antwerp Consulate General; Lagos; NATO Defense </p><p>College; Counselor at Turkey\'s Permanent Mission to NATO; </p><p>Counselor in Damascus; head of the Economic and Commercial </p><p>Cooperation Permanent Committee of the Islamic Conference </p><p>Organization in Jiddah; formed and headed the ISEDAK </p><p>Coordination Bureau in Turkey\'s State Planning Organization. </p><p>From 1988-92 Ambassador to Riyadh; 1992-95 MFA Deputy </p><p>Undersecretary for Economic Affairs; 1995-98 Ambassador to </p><p>Cairo; 1998-2001 Permanent Representative at Turkey\'s Mission </p><p>to the UN in Vienna.  Retired 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Married, one child.  Speaks French, Arabic, fluent </p><p>English.  Recipient of the Saudi Government\'s King Abdulaziz </p><p>Award (first degree).  Several publications, inter alia on </p><p>Middle East water issues, Histadrut, and Turco-Egyptian </p><p>Relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Yakis is described by both AK officials and MFA </p><p>officials as liable to be captured by the MFA establishment </p><p>if, as expected, he becomes Foreign Minister.  One MFA </p><p>contact described him as someone who would not be strong at </p><p>the MFA helm.  From Embassy contacts with him he strikes us </p><p>as extraordinarily protocol-conscious and as having a chip on </p><p>his shoulder with regard to the MFA: at once eager to return </p><p>at a higher rank than his former colleagues and at the same </p><p>time anxious to prove that his talents were unrecognized </p><p>during his career.  He has told us he wants to take a fresh </p><p>look at Turkey\'s rocky relations with its Arab neighbors and </p><p>Iran. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) The one area where we have seen him move beyond </p><p>conventional thinking is Iraq.  He has expressed a strong </p><p>preference for a peaceful solution, but also engaged in </p><p>creative thinking in our presence about how to handle the </p><p>problem of the Kurds in Northern Iraq, floating the idea that </p><p>perhaps the creation of two independent states there would </p><p>help keep the Kurds in check. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
