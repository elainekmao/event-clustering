<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002957 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/MTA/IPC - WILSON AND EUR/SE </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR DBIRDSEY/KALVAREZ, PATENT AND </p><p>TRADEMARK OFFICE FOR URBAN, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS FOR TEPP </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KIPR, TU, USTR, WTO </p><p>SUBJECT:  Special 301 Demarche Delivered; GOT Plans to </p><p>Address Data Exclusivity Soon </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  State 111529 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Noting outstanding issues in </p><p>pharmaceuticals, copyright and trademark protection, </p><p>Emboffs informed GOT interlocutors that Turkey will </p><p>remain on the Special 301 Watch List this year.  In a </p><p>change from its earlier position that data exclusivity </p><p>is not required by the TRIPS Agreement, the Health </p><p>Ministry told us it intends to implement this </p><p>protection, with a decision on the modalities to be </p><p>taken in June.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Emboffs met with officials from the Health and </p><p>Foreign Ministries and the Customs Undersecretariat in </p><p>connection with the U.S. decision to maintain Turkey on </p><p>the Special 301 Watch List.  We stressed Turkey\'s </p><p>obligation under the WTO TRIPS Agreement to implement </p><p>data exclusivity protection for pharmaceuticals as well </p><p>as continuing concerns on enforcement of copyrights and </p><p>trademarks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In a reversal of the Health Ministry\'s prior </p><p>position on this subject, Hayriye Mihcak, General </p><p>Director for Pharmaceuticals, acknowledged the </p><p>obligation to implement data exclusivity under TRIPS and </p><p>the EU Customs Union.  She stated that the issue had </p><p>been discussed at a GOT meeting with the private sector </p><p>and EU representatives on April 10.  Following that </p><p>meeting, the GOT solicited input from the private sector </p><p>as to the financial impact of implementing data </p><p>exclusivity.  Pharmaceuticals industry associations </p><p>committed to providing their input on this issue by mid- </p><p>June.  Mihcak told Econoff she expects the GOT to decide </p><p>on when and for what period to implement data </p><p>exclusivity by mid-June, before she leaves for the </p><p>United States on an International Visitors Program on </p><p>IPR issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) In a subsequent meeting, Health U/S Necdet </p><p>Unuvar confirmed that Turkey considers itself obligated, </p><p>under both TRIPS and the terms of its Customs Union </p><p>Agreement with the EU, to implement data exclusivity. </p><p>He indicated the MFA was now looking at legal issues </p><p>involved in data exclusivity implementation, but offered </p><p>no timeline for it.  Unuvar also said the GOT was still </p><p>studying the period of protection that data exclusivity </p><p>would provide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Oya Karakas, MFA Head of Department, </p><p>Multilateral Economic Affairs, told Econoff that the GOT </p><p>would work toward removal of Turkey from the Special 301 </p><p>Watch List.  In coming weeks, MFA would meet with </p><p>relevant GOT institutions to develop a plan to address </p><p>intellectual property concerns.  She said the GOT </p><p>intends to implement data exclusivity, but would like to </p><p>obtain private sector input as to the best way of doing </p><p>this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Mehmet Gucuk, MFA Deputy Director General for </p><p>Bilateral Economic Affairs, told Econoff that the Health </p><p>Ministry believes data exclusivity is not required by </p><p>the TRIPS Agreement.  As for the EU Customs Union </p><p>requirement on data exclusivity, Gucuk acknowledged that </p><p>this issue was prominent in Turkey\'s economic dialogue </p><p>with the EU.  However, he related that many in the GOT </p><p>believed that Turkey had been overly hasty in making </p><p>commitments to harmonize economic legislation under the </p><p>customs union, including for data exclusivity, and that </p><p>other EU candidate countries had succeeded in obtaining </p><p>lead times to implement data exclusivity.  Comment: </p><p>Gucuk does not follow IPR issues closely, and probably </p><p>did not represent the GOT\'s current position on data </p><p>exclusivity.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Ercan Saka, General Director for EU and Foreign </p><p>Relations at the Customs Undersecretariat, stated that </p><p>improving the intellectual property regime was a high </p><p>priority for the GOT, but did not elaborate on the GOT\'s </p><p>plans in this area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Alp Sevindik, Director for Corporate Affairs, </p><p>Pfizer, confirmed that the Health Ministry has told the </p><p>private sector that it plans to implement data </p><p>exclusivity.  He attributes this to EU pressure, </p><p>including a threat to launch a WTO case.  Sevindik </p><p>expressed concern that, if the GOT decides on delayed </p><p>implementation of data exclusivity, generic producers </p><p>may rush to register products which will gain protection </p><p>before the implementation date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Embassy plans to meet with the Culture Ministry </p><p>on copyright issues identified in the Special 301 </p><p>announcement in the near future. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
