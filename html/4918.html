<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 000011 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OPIC FOR CYNTHIA HOESTLER, JIM HANSLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/31/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EINV, JO, OPIC </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN: POST VIEWS ON ENLARGING INTERARAB FUND </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 ( </p><p>b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Summary.  In response to proposals to increase the </p><p>size and nature of OPIC\'s support for the Amman-based </p><p>InterArab Fund, Embassy staff took a hard look at the Fund\'s </p><p>current activities as well as the factual basis of persistent </p><p>local rumors about improprieties involving the Fund\'s </p><p>management.  We found nothing to substantiate these </p><p>allegations and indeed found evidence to disprove most of </p><p>them, but we conclude that the InterArab Fund suffers from </p><p>inadequate management and oversight that has prevented it </p><p>from making a significant contribution to increasing foreign </p><p>investment in Jordan.  We believe that these deficiencies can </p><p>be addressed by reorganizing and professionalizing the </p><p>management of the Fund, putting an enlarged InterArab Fund in </p><p>a better position to make a significant contribution to </p><p>Jordan\'s economic development and U.S. interests here.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  In light of Washington\'s consideration of the </p><p>possibility of increasing the size and scope of OPIC\'s </p><p>support for the InterArab Fund, post is providing the </p><p>following background on the local activities and reputation </p><p>of the Fund.  The Amman-based Fund is an OPIC-supported </p><p>investment fund that has a mandate to invest in Jordan, Oman, </p><p>and the Palestinian territories.  Its current authorized size </p><p>is $45 million, two-thirds of which can be borrowed from </p><p>OPIC, with one-third from private investors.  We understand </p><p>that OPIC staff is considering a proposal that would increase </p><p>the maximum size of the fund to $105 million and allow the </p><p>fund to invest all of its assets in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>FDI in Jordan Low Despite Reforms </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  The success of the InterArab Fund in catalyzing </p><p>private foreign direct investment in Jordan would be an </p><p>important complement to the growing bilateral economic </p><p>relationship between the United States and Jordan.  The </p><p>success of the economic relationship undergirds the United </p><p>States\' unique political and security relationship with </p><p>Jordan.  It reinforces moderate policies and strengthens the </p><p>hand of King Abdullah and his governments in dealing with the </p><p>homegrown extremism that has its roots in persistent </p><p>underemployment and poverty.  In the region, Jordan\'s </p><p>economic success serves as a model to show how open, </p><p>pro-growth economic policies can foster economic development, </p><p>poverty alleviation and political stability. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Over the past decade, Jordan has made impressive </p><p>strides in opening its economy to foreign trade and </p><p>investment while maintaining sound macroeconomic policies. </p><p>Its list of economic reforms and initiatives is impressive, </p><p>including accession to the WTO, negotiation of a free trade </p><p>area with the United States, a partnership agreement with the </p><p>European Union, and bilateral investment treaties with the </p><p>United States and European countries.  In addition, </p><p>considerable progress has been made in modernizing and </p><p>deregulating domestic financial and goods markets.  The U.S. </p><p>Government has supported nearly all of these initiatives </p><p>through technical assistance and policy-conditioned cash </p><p>grants provided through USAID. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  Jordan\'s investment performance has been </p><p>disappointing despite these reforms and a recent surge in </p><p>export-led GDP growth.  A recent country survey by the Atlas </p><p>Investment Group concluded, "In recent years, gross fixed </p><p>investment, measured as a percent of GDP, has remained </p><p>relatively flat and insufficient, averaging around 25% of GDP </p><p>in the period 1997-2000.  Moreover, investments have </p><p>typically been channeled into non-productive sectors such as </p><p>construction."  While this observation applies to both </p><p>domestic investment and FDI, foreign investment has been </p><p>particularly disappointing.  With the exception of large </p><p>inflows associated with the privatization of the telephone </p><p>and cement companies, there has been little foreign </p><p>investment in Jordan\'s manufacturing and nascent high-tech </p><p>sectors, despite a dynamic young entrepreneurial sector, a </p><p>relatively skilled and available local workforce and the </p><p>successful example of the QIZ initiative.  (The largest U.S. </p><p>investment, a joint venture between the Abelmarle Co. of </p><p>Richmond and the Arab Potash Company is in the mining sector.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Disappointing Contribution So Far </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  In this light, the performance of the InterArab </p><p>Fund in attracting new foreign investment to Jordan has been </p><p>less than impressive.  In four years, the Fund has invested </p><p>in four projects in Jordan for a total of approximately $12.7 </p><p>million.  None of these investments currently appears to be </p><p>generating a return for the Fund or for the Jordanian </p><p>economy.  According to InterArab Fund manager Dr. Fuad Abu </p><p>Zayyad, the limited use of available funds is explained by </p><p>existing geographical restrictions on fund investments (only </p><p>one third of the $45 million could be invested in Jordan </p><p>under the current structure). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  At the same time, Abu Zayyad says that the narrow </p><p>range of the Fund\'s investments is explained by a limited </p><p>supply of investment grade projects in Jordan.  While this is </p><p>a common complaint of local banks and investors, it appears </p><p>from embassy\'s soundings that the InterArab Fund is not </p><p>well-known in the local business and financial communities as </p><p>a potential source of financing.  Bankers, including those </p><p>favorable to the fund, describe the fund as inactive, and as </p><p>not being a partner in the financial community.  Thus, the </p><p>Fund does not appear to be a port of call for investors </p><p>seeking financing for viable projects.  Abu Zayyad </p><p>acknowledges this, and says the Fund needs to become more </p><p>active in the community, although he says he has faced </p><p>resistance as an outsider on the local scene. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Allegations of Improprieties Not Substantiated </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  There are also persistent rumors of improper </p><p>activities and business practices associated with the </p><p>InterArab Fund management.  Sources of these rumors include </p><p>bankers and investors as well as past and present senior </p><p>government officials.  The most significant allegations are, </p><p> </p><p>1) That companies in which the fund has invested have paid </p><p>inflated amounts for land and equipment to parties who are </p><p>related to fund management. </p><p> </p><p>2) That companies in which the fund has invested have sold </p><p>equipment to parties related to fund management at prices </p><p>below their value and that the companies themselves are not </p><p>functioning businesses. </p><p> </p><p>3) That fund management is receiving management fees out of </p><p>line with the fund agreement. </p><p> </p><p>4) That there is circular investment among companies in which </p><p>the fund has invested and the fund itself.  That is, that </p><p>fund management has agreed with companies in which it plans </p><p>to invest that if those companies invest in the fund </p><p>(generating contributions from OPIC), the fund will invest in </p><p>companies at more than their actual value. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (sbu)  Post has worked to carefully assess these </p><p>allegations and has discussed them extensively with both </p><p>independent parties and with Dr. Abu Zayyad.  We have not </p><p>been able to find any evidence to substantiate these claims. </p><p>For example, an allegation that the Jordan Valley Fisheries </p><p>Company (in which the fund has invested $4.8 million) paid an </p><p>excessive amount for the land on which it is located appears </p><p>to be untrue.  The Fund was able to produce documents showing </p><p>that the fishery leases its land from the Jordan Valley </p><p>Authority at a nominal rate. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (sbu)  Similarly, we were not able to substantiate the </p><p>allegation that fund companies have sold equipment and are </p><p>not actually operational.  Post officers visited three of the </p><p>fund\'s Jordanian investments (the fishery and the two </p><p>internet-based ventures) and found each of them to be ongoing </p><p>enterprises with impressive management, existing sales and </p><p>business, and prospects for additional business.  We were not </p><p>able to visit the Modern Agricultural Investment Company, </p><p>located south of the Dead Sea, in which the fund has invested </p><p>1.1 million (8% of its assets).  Abu Zayyad admits that this </p><p>is the least promising of the four investments in Jordan and </p><p>that the company has had difficulty finding competent </p><p>management.  Nevertheless, Abu Zayyad says the MAIC\'s </p><p>original Israel-sourced greenhouses are still being used and </p><p>that the company is under new management and will hopefully </p><p>turn the corner in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (sbu)   It was not evident from a brief examination of </p><p>the fund\'s financial statements Fund management is receiving </p><p>fees in excess of those provided for in the fund agreement. </p><p>In fact, it appears that the InterArab management company has </p><p>reinvested a substantial portion of the fees it has received </p><p>back into the Fund. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (sbu)  The suggestion of circular investment appears to </p><p>be the most serious allegation, and the one that is most </p><p>difficult for post to assess.  Dr. Abu Zayyad asserts that it </p><p>is the Fund\'s clear policy not to engage in this practice. </p><p>In support of this, he showed Econ/C a list of current fund </p><p>investors.  None of those listed were companies in which the </p><p>fund had an investment interest.  However, the 2001 financial </p><p>statement of Aregon (one of the internet investments) </p><p>contained a note stating that Aregon had invested in the </p><p>InterArab Fund.  Abu Zayyad and Aregon\'s general manager said </p><p>that this was an error.  However, both acknowledged that some </p><p>stockholders in Aregon were also investors in the Corex </p><p>group, an investor in the InterArab Fund.  Since the embassy </p><p>was not given copies of these documents, we recommend that </p><p>OPIC look into this issue to its satisfaction, if it has not </p><p>already done so. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Conclusion: Management Needs Strengthening </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  (sbu)  The very allgegations of improprieties -- </p><p>combined with the facts that the fund is not well-known or </p><p>respected in the local business and financial communities and </p><p>that the fund\'s investments have yet to generate a return -- </p><p>suggests that something has not been working.  To some extent </p><p>the fund\'s poor local image seems to be a function of the </p><p>fact that nearly all of the investors in the fund are </p><p>associated with Dr. Abu Zayyad either through family or </p><p>previous business relationships.  In Jordan\'s factional, </p><p>family-centered business community, this no doubt contributes </p><p>to some of the sniping.  But in embassy\'s view, the most </p><p>fundamental basis of the Fund\'s problems is inadequate </p><p>management and oversight.  Dr. Abu Zayyad is basically a "one </p><p>man show," as he admits, and has been seriously ill for much </p><p>of the last year.  He is not supported by an experienced </p><p>staff and does not seem to have business experience in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (sbu)  Post understands that an OPIC consultant who </p><p>visited Amman in October 2002 prepared a report suggesting a </p><p>number of ways to improve fund management and oversight. </p><p>These include hiring professional senior management staff and </p><p>creating stronger internal controls by strengthening the </p><p>Fund\'s investment and advisory committees (expanding the </p><p>latter to include prominent Jordanians unconnected to the </p><p>Fund or to Abu Zayyad).  We believe that implementing the </p><p>changes called for in this report will go a long way toward </p><p>improving the management and the local image of the fund.  In </p><p>addition, a higher profile, strengthened management and </p><p>broader fundraising should encourage a broader base of </p><p>investment in the fund.  Finally, while allegations of </p><p>improprieties have not been substantiated, OPIC officials </p><p>should continue to actively examine and supervise the Fund\'s </p><p>activities and investments. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (sbu)  Once the proposed organizational and oversight </p><p>changes have been implemented, and strengthened professional </p><p>management is in place, Post believes that enlarging OPIC\'s </p><p>financial support would help put the InterArab Fund in an </p><p>excellent position to make a positive contribution to </p><p>Jordan\'s business and financial community, and thereby </p><p>contribute to spurring greater foreign and domestic </p><p>investment in the Jordanian economy.  Such a fund would find </p><p>synergies with USAID-supported programs and with other </p><p>investment funds being created in Jordan.  A new $50 million </p><p>"Jordan Fund," for example, is financed by the Jordanian </p><p>government and managed by the local Foursan Group with help </p><p>from Deutschebank New York.  Jordan Fund management told us </p><p>that while they would look forward to working with a </p><p>professionally managed InterArab Fund, and that both funds </p><p>would be strengthened by the competition to find good </p><p>projects.  The Embassy would look forward to working with </p><p>OPIC and a reinvigorated InterArab Fund to help make it </p><p>another important piece of the U.S.-Jordan economic success </p><p>story. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
