<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001434 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FROM AMBASSADOR WILLS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:  08/06/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, ECON, CE, LTTE - Peace Process, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT:  Scenesetter for your upcoming visit to </p><p>Sri Lanka </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills:  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) I want to extend a very warm welcome to you on </p><p>your August 22-23 visit to Sri Lanka.  The Country Team </p><p>and the entire Mission community eagerly look forward to </p><p>your visit. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Your visit to Sri Lanka comes at an exciting </p><p>time.  The ongoing ceasefire is the longest break that </p><p>Sri Lankans have had from the ethnic conflict since it </p><p>began in 1983.  There are hopeful signs that the </p><p>government and the Tamil Tigers may sit down for </p><p>negotiations at some point later this year.  The </p><p>situation remains fluid, however, with Tiger intentions </p><p>unclear.  The peace process could also be undermined by </p><p>foes in the south, possibly working in tandem with </p><p>President Kumaratunga, who has increasingly tense </p><p>cohabitation relations with the government.  The </p><p>government is also working hard on economic reforms. </p><p>Overall, this is a period of tremendous opportunity and </p><p>volatility in Sri Lanka.  It is also a time of </p><p>significant U.S. influence.  Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe wants to work closely with the U.S., as </p><p>he made clear during his recent visit to Washington. </p><p>Your visit will help cement the gains made in U.S.-Sri </p><p>Lankan relations, while underscoring our strong support </p><p>for the peace process.  As events in coming days could </p><p>be consequential regarding cohabitation ties, I may </p><p>update you with another message before your arrival. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Status of the Peace Process </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The election of a new government in </p><p>December 2001 heralded in an exciting period in </p><p>Sri Lanka.  The United National Front (UNF) government </p><p>headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has taken </p><p>an activist posture, particularly regarding the peace </p><p>process.  In short order, the government and the </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) re-initiated the </p><p>stalled Norwegian government facilitation effort and put </p><p>unilateral ceasefires into effect in December 2001.  The </p><p>government also took rapid steps to ease tensions by </p><p>lifting roadblocks and checkpoints, and ending bans on </p><p>medicine and other items entering LTTE-controlled </p><p>territories.  Continuing the trend of the past several </p><p>years, the government\'s performance on human rights </p><p>issues has also been a strong one, with many fewer </p><p>Tamils complaining of mistreatment at the hands of the </p><p>security forces.  (Note:  There is still an appearance </p><p>of impunity in some cases that the GSL needs to deal </p><p>with, however.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In a benchmark event, the GSL and the LTTE </p><p>concluded a formal ceasefire accord in February.  The </p><p>accord led to the reopening of a key road link </p><p>connecting Jaffna to the south in April.  The LTTE, </p><p>however, has complained that the GSL has not done enough </p><p>to implement the accord in other areas, such as by </p><p>vacating temples and public buildings in the north and </p><p>east.  The government says (accurately) that it is </p><p>trying hard to comply with the terms of the accord.  The </p><p>accord is being monitored by the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka </p><p>Monitoring Mission (SLMM), which has performed capably, </p><p>but is thin on the ground (roughly 50 personnel total). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) All of these steps have had a dramatic effect in </p><p>decreasing tensions in the country, bringing relief to a </p><p>war weary populace.  Already, the ongoing ceasefire is </p><p>the longest break that Sri Lankans have had from the </p><p>ethnic conflict since it began in 1983.  This new spirit </p><p>was symbolized by PM Wickremesinghe\'s visit to Jaffna in </p><p>March, the first such visit by a GSL leader in years. </p><p>Assistant Secretary Rocca joined Wickeremesinghe for </p><p>part of this visit, underscoring U.S. support for the </p><p>peace process.  A/S Rocca\'s visit also led to the </p><p>arrival of a demining team sponsored by the U.S., which </p><p>has been clearing mines in Jaffna since April. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) At this time, the focus of the peace process is </p><p>"talks on talks," i.e., trying to reach agreement on </p><p>modalities for face-to-face negotiations on a permanent </p><p>settlement of the conflict.  The GSL has indicated its </p><p>readiness for talks for some months now, but the LTTE </p><p>has been holding back its agreement to a date certain </p><p>for starting them.  In a positive sign, senior Minister </p><p>Milinda Moragoda held talks with LTTE spokesman Anton </p><p>Balasingham in London on July 27.  The talks were </p><p>constructive, and Moragoda believes that high-level </p><p>negotiations could begin at some point in September or </p><p>October.  (Note:  The two sides have already agreed that </p><p>the venue of the talks will be Thailand.)  Balasingham </p><p>is due to visit LTTE-controlled areas in the north in </p><p>late August, around the same time that Norwegian Deputy </p><p>Foreign Minister Helgesen is scheduled to visit Colombo. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Despite so much progress in so short a time, GSL </p><p>interlocutors will be the first to tell you that the </p><p>situation is fluid.  One key reason for this is lack of </p><p>confidence in the LTTE.  While it is clear that the LTTE </p><p>is worried about further international isolation in the </p><p>aftermath of September 11, it is not clear whether the </p><p>organization is simply looking for a hiatus to wait out </p><p>the storm.  Some of the LTTE\'s activities raise </p><p>questions about its commitment to peace, including </p><p>forced recruitment for its military (some of it of </p><p>children), and the widespread extortion of money from </p><p>Tamils and Muslims.  The LTTE also remains authoritarian </p><p>in structure and has not renounced terrorism. </p><p>Nonetheless, the GSL -- fully realizing it is taking a </p><p>big risk -- has made the decision that it wants to test </p><p>the LTTE to determine whether it is for real. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Cohabitation Friction </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Another factor that could unravel the peace </p><p>process is domestic opposition in the south.  The </p><p>radical, Sinhalese chauvinist Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP) has engaged in rallies and demonstrations against </p><p>the ceasefire accord.  A potentially more ominous threat </p><p>to the peace process is President Kumaratunga and her </p><p>party, who have sent mixed signals, at times </p><p>constructive, at times critical.  Kumaratunga\'s attitude </p><p>seems largely bound up in the cohabitation tensions that </p><p>flare between her and Prime Minister Wickremasinghe\'s </p><p>government.  Of late, these tensions have only climbed </p><p>higher, and the GSL is threatening to call snap </p><p>elections if the president does not back down.  At the </p><p>same time, there is talk that the president may try to </p><p>force the government out, suspend Parliament, and call </p><p>for elections.  None of these rumblings is good for the </p><p>peace process, especially during this sensitive period </p><p>when the modalities of negotiations are being debated </p><p>with the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Economic Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Turning to economic issues, Sri Lanka has the </p><p>most open economy in South Asia and a relatively high </p><p>per capita income (USD 837).  Still, economic growth in </p><p>Sri Lanka has been uneven and is mostly confined to the </p><p>greater Colombo region, while the conflict areas in the </p><p>north and the east suffer severe economic degradation. </p><p>A litany of problems in 2001 conspired to produce the </p><p>country\'s first year of GDP contraction since </p><p>independence (minus 1.4 percent).  The new UNF </p><p>government appears committed to putting the right </p><p>policies in place to re-ignite economic growth.  The </p><p>main test of this commitment came in its 2002 budget, </p><p>presented in March.  This budget contained many </p><p>substantive reform measures and was key to restarting </p><p>the suspended payments of the IMF\'s Standby Arrangement. </p><p>The government is now implementing many of these </p><p>reforms, while trying to minimize the burden of </p><p>increased prices on the population.  We expect 2002 to </p><p>be a rebuilding year, with growth of 1-2 percent. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) On the commercial side, Sri Lanka has </p><p>historically had a large trade imbalance with the </p><p>U.S. (10:1 in recent years).  The recently signed Trade </p><p>and Investment Framework Agreement will formalize </p><p>discussions on opportunities and problems in bilateral </p><p>trade.  The Prime Minister is planning a trip to New </p><p>York in September that will focus, in part, on </p><p>attracting investors and stimulating U.S. interest in </p><p>doing business in Sri Lanka.  You may hear from GSL </p><p>contacts about Sri Lanka\'s interest in negotiating a </p><p>Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.  We are encouraged by </p><p>the signals from Washington that Sri Lanka may be on the </p><p>list for a FTA in the future, but are aware, as is the </p><p>GSL, that this will not happen in the near-term.  Sri </p><p>Lanka is also very interested in the Millennium </p><p>Challenge Account. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) This exciting period in Sri Lanka provides many </p><p>opportunities for the U.S.  Per the recent policy </p><p>review, USG teams are due to visit Sri Lanka soon to </p><p>review enhanced defense cooperation, economic and </p><p>commercial issues, and the possible return of the Peace </p><p>Corps.  As he made clear during his recent visit to </p><p>Washington, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe wants to work </p><p>closely with the U.S.  Your visit will help cement U.S.- </p><p>Sri Lankan relations and underscore our strong support </p><p>for the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) We suggest that you make the following key </p><p>points in your meetings with GSL and other </p><p>interlocutors: </p><p> </p><p>-- Express U.S. support for the peace process and </p><p>Norwegian facilitation.  GSL needs to be bold; keep up </p><p>momentum.  Sri Lanka is a vital symbol of movement </p><p>toward peace and stability in a troubled region. </p><p> </p><p>-- Stress that U.S. wants to assist GSL on both peace </p><p>and economic fronts in concrete ways.  U.S. demining </p><p>assistance continues in Jaffna, for example, and Peace </p><p>Corps is assessing possible return. </p><p> </p><p>-- All parties should work in national interest on peace </p><p>process and on economic reform.  It is important that </p><p>peace process not falter because of political </p><p>infighting. </p><p> </p><p>-- Human rights issues important; GSL has shown </p><p>significant improvement; need to work to end appearance </p><p>of impunity. </p><p> </p><p>-- Would like to see increased opportunities for U.S. </p><p>exports and investment; GSL needs to follow through on </p><p>economic reform agenda in order to foster a competitive </p><p>environment and create growth. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) As events in coming days could be </p><p>consequential regarding cohabitation ties, I may update </p><p>you with another message before your arrival. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
