<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000651 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, ASEC, PTER, IZ, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  "MASS" PEACE RALLIES IN HANOI </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A. HANOI  409    B.  HANOI 396    C. HCMC 157 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Similar to the pro-peace meeting they organized on </p><p>February 18 in Hanoi (ref b), the Vietnam Fatherland Front </p><p>(VFF), the Vietnam Peace Committee, the Committee for Asian- </p><p>African-Latin American Solidarity and Cooperation, and the </p><p>Vietnam-Iraq Friendship Society jointly sponsored another </p><p>anti-war protest in Hanoi on March 15.  According to </p><p>official press accounts, between 2,000-5,000 people from all </p><p>walks of life attended, including busloads of schoolchildren </p><p>as well as representatives of religious groups, workers, </p><p>intellectuals, etc.  The protest was notable mostly for its </p><p>location: outdoors in the Indira Gandhi Park adjacent to the </p><p>downtown Hoan Kiem Lake. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Organizers formally referred to this occasion a </p><p>"meeting" rather than a rally or demonstration.  In true </p><p>Communist style, even this outdoor gathering "passed a </p><p>resolution" opposing military action by the U.S., the UK, </p><p>and other "warlike forces" and calling for "political </p><p>measures" in order to avoid "additional hardships" for the </p><p>Iraqi people.  VFF chief Pham The Duyet, a former CPV </p><p>Politburo member, called for the UN and all "responsible </p><p>governments" to do everything in their power in accordance </p><p>with international law, as well as in the "common interests </p><p>of peace-loving peoples," to protect the independence and </p><p>sovereignty of all nations, including Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Separately, the Vietnam Women\'s Union, another mass </p><p>organization under the VFF, held a rally also on March 15 </p><p>similarly to express its hope for peace, its opposition to </p><p>war, and its "complete sympathy" with the women and people </p><p>of Iraq.  The representatives called on all parties to </p><p>"prevent war in time" and to find "fair political measures" </p><p>for the Iraqi problem consistent with the UN Charter and </p><p>international law. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Comment:  These mass gatherings may lack the </p><p>spontaneity or non-official nature of anti-war protests </p><p>elsewhere in the world (which have been reported extensively </p><p>in the state media here), but do reflect a carefully </p><p>cultivated popular suspicion of US motives and a deep </p><p>aversion to US-led military action against Iraq.  More </p><p>official and semi-official protests and rallies can be </p><p>expected if military action against Iraq begins (with or </p><p>without UN Security Council approval).  The GVN and CPV may </p><p>even go so far as to orchestrate protests at or near US </p><p>diplomatic facilities.  Nonetheless, Embassy continues to </p><p>believe that GVN public security forces will ensure that any </p><p>protests do not threaten our facilities or personnel. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
