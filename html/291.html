<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 CAIRO 16206 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR MILLIKEN, PARIS FOR WINN, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DEC:OADR </p><p>TAGS: KISL, PGOV, PINS, KPRP, EG </p><p>SUBJECT: MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD:  DEFANGED BUT REHABILITATED </p><p> </p><p>REF:  FBIS JN2505152689 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  TWO YEARS AGO, MUBARAK BET THAT BY </p><p>ADMITTING THE OUTLAWED MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB) TO THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY, THE GROUP WOULD BE COOPTED AND THUS </p><p>UNDERMINED AS THE CATALYST OF AN ISLAMIC OPPOSITION </p><p>MOVEMENT.  NOW, THE BET IS PAYING OFF: THE MB HAS </p><p>GAINED IN STATUS IN THE RAREFIED ESTABLISHMENT </p><p>POLITICAL ARENA, BUT HAS BEEN DEFANGED AS A THREAT TO </p><p>THE REGIME.  EXTERNAL AND DOMESTIC FACTORS ALSO HAVE </p><p>HELPED DIMINISH ANXIETY OVER THE MB IN PARTICULAR AND </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY ISLAM IN GENERAL:  THE FAILURE OF ISLAMIC </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN IRAN; THE COLLAPSE OF THE "ISLAMIC" </p><p>INVESTMENT COMPANIES; DISSENSION BETWEEN THE MB AND ITS </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTNERS AND MORE EXTREME ISLAMIC RIVALS; </p><p>AND A STRING OF MB PROGRAM FAILURES UNDER A GERIATRIC </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  YET, THE MB ALSO HAS BENEFITED FROM </p><p>PLAYING THE REGIME\'S GAME:  IN PART, THE REHABILITATION </p><p>OF THE MB IS A STRATEGIC SUCCESS OF THEIR OWN ATTEMPT </p><p>TO APPEAR RESPONSIBLE AND ESTABLISHMENTARIAN.  THAT </p><p>THEY AIM CLEARLY AT THE POLITICAL CENTER IS CLEAR FROM </p><p>THEIR MOST RECENT, REMARKABLY MODERATE-SOUNDING </p><p>PLATFORM.  THUS, THEY MAY BE SUCCEEDING IN TRANSFORMING </p><p>FROM A PERCEIVED POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY FORCE INTO A </p><p>MORE SUBTLE BUT STILL SUBSTANTIAL THREAT TO THE </p><p>REGIME:  A POTENTIALLY PLAUSIBLE, "MODERATE" CIVILIAN </p><p>ALTERNATIVE.  THOUGH THEY ARE STILL FAR FROM ACHIEVING </p><p>SUCH A DEGREE OF CREDIBILITY, WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE, </p><p>DISCIPLINE, MONEY, LINGERING POPULARITY, AND YOUNGER </p><p>TALENT WAITING RESPECTFULLY IN THE WINGS, THE MB SEEM </p><p>THE OPPOSITION ELEMENT MOST LIKELY TO ENDURE IN </p><p>EGYPTIAN POLITICS.  MOREOVER, IT IS NOT YET CLEAR </p><p>WHETHER THE MB HAVE DETERMINED TO STAY WITHIN THE </p><p>SYSTEM.  MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNMENT REMAINS A FAR MORE </p><p>INFLUENTIAL FORCE THAN THE MB OR ANY OTHER POLITICAL </p><p>GROUP IN THE BROADER, CULTURAL RELIGIOUS REAWAKENING. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>REHABILITATION FOR REGIME PURPOSES </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  LEGAL LIMBO:  OVER ITS 60 YEARS OF EXISTENCE, THE </p><p>MB HAS USUALLY SPRAWLED MORE (BUT NOT ENTIRELY) TO ONE </p><p>SIDE OR THE OTHER OF THE AMBIGUOUS DIVISION BETWEEN </p><p>UNDERGROUND AND ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS.  TODAY, IT IS </p><p>ALL BUT COMPLETELY INTO THE MAINSTREAM POLITICAL ARENA, </p><p>FORSWEARING UNDERGROUND ACTIVITY AND POSSESSING ALL THE </p><p>EARMARKS AND ACTIVITIES OF A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL PARTY </p><p>EXCEPT THE OFFICIAL LICENSE TO CALL ITSELF ONE.  THE MB </p><p>MAINTAINS THAT THE 1954 DECREE DISSOLVING IT WAS LATER </p><p>RESCINDED.  THE GROUP CONTINUES TO SLOG ALONG WITH AN </p><p>ARRAY OF LEGAL CASES AIMED AT GAINING FORMAL PARTY </p><p>STATUS AND RECOVERING VARIOUS SUSPENDED PUBLISHING </p><p>LICENSES.  AT THE SAME TIME, INTERIOR MINISTER ZAKI </p><p>BADR LOSES NO OPPORTUNITY TO PROCLAIM THE MB IS </p><p>ILLEGAL, CRIMINAL, SUBVERSIVE -- AND DOES NOT EVEN </p><p>EXIST; IF IT DID EXIST, ITS MEMBERS SHOULD BE IN JAIL, </p><p>NOT STANDING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  POLITICAL PAWNS:  SADAT BEGAN THE MB\'S </p><p>REHABILITATION WHEN, IN THE MID-1970S, HE RELEASED </p><p>THOSE OLDTIME MB PERSONALITIES WHO HAD SURVIVED </p><p>NASSER\'S PRISONS.  HIS OBJECTIVE WAS TO HELP ESTABLISH </p><p>HIS CREDENTIALS AS THE "BELIEVER PRESIDENT", AIMING TO </p><p>USE ISLAM TO CRUSH THE REMNANTS OF LEFTIST INFLUENCE. </p><p>MUBARAK FURTHER EXPANDED THE MB\'S ACCESS TO </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS BY ALLOWING ABOUT SIX OF THEM TO </p><p>BE ELECTED TO THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY UNDER THE </p><p>OPPOSITION WAFD PARTY IN 1984.  ZAKI BADR\'S VIEWS </p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING, IN 1987, MUBARAK ALLOWED ABOUT 35 MB </p><p>DEPUTIES TO BE OPENLY IDENTIFIED AND ELECTED AS SUCH </p><p>(WITH ONLY THE THINNEST OF LEGAL COVERS AS TECHNICAL </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY).  MUBARAK\'S </p><p>MOTIVES WERE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM SADAT\'S: UNDER HIS </p><p>CONCEPT OF "DEMOCRACY" (ESSENTIALLY MEANING FREEDOM OF </p><p>SPEECH) AS A "SAFETY VALVE", HE EVIDENTLY CALCULATED </p><p>THAT THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY THREAT PERCEIVED IN </p><p>THOSE TIMES WOULD PROVE MORE MANAGEABLE ABOVE GROUND, </p><p>WITH THE MB AS THE PRINCIPAL VOICE OF POLITICAL ISLAM. </p><p>OVER TWO YEARS AFTER MUBARAK WAS ACCUSED OF A DANGEROUS </p><p>GAMBLE, IT APPEARS THAT THE CALCULATIONS BEHIND HIS BET </p><p>WERE CORRECT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  DE FACTO PARTY: TODAY, THE MB RECEIVE FOREIGN </p><p>DIPLOMATS AND JOURNALISTS -- WITHOUT THE ADVANCE </p><p>APPROVAL OF THE INTERIOR MINISTRY UPON WHICH THEY USED </p><p>TO INSIST AS RECENTLY AS 1986 -- AND CONDUCT OTHER </p><p>ORDINARY POLITICAL PARTY BUSINESS AT A WELL-KNOWN HQ IN </p><p>DOWNTOWN CAIRO.  THEY PUBLISH A MONTHLY MAGAZINE (LIWA\' </p><p>AL-ISLAM, THE BANNER OF ISLAM) AND HAVE DIRECT ACCESS </p><p>TO SEVERAL OTHER INDEPENDENT MONTHLIES AND WEEKLIES </p><p>(AL-\'ETISAM, AL-MOKHTAR AL-ISLAMI, AL-NUR, AL-SHAAB). </p><p>MB MEMBERS ALSO ARE IDENTIFIED AS SUCH ON THE BOARDS OF </p><p>THE PHYSICIANS AND JOURNALISTS\' SYNDICATES AND, UNTIL </p><p>RECENTLY, THE LAWYERS\' SYNDICATE.  THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>RECOGNITION OF THE MB AS A POLITICAL PARTY REMAINS </p><p>THEIR IDENTITY AS AN INDEPENDENT GROUP IN THE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>ASSEMBLY UNDER THEIR OWN DELEGATION LEADER, FORMER </p><p>SENIOR JUDGE MA\'MUN AL-HODEIBY (SON OF AN EARLY SUPREME </p><p>GUIDE).  THE MB NOW ARE THE LARGEST (THERE ARE ABOUT </p><p>33) AND CERTAINLY THE MOST COHESIVE BLOC OF OPPOSITION </p><p>DEPUTIES IN THE ASSEMBLY.  MOREOVER, THE MB AND THE </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT, RELATIVELY SECULAR NATIONALIST WAFD, ARE </p><p>THE ONLY TWO LEGAL OPPOSITION GROUPINGS WITH ANY PROVEN </p><p>HISTORIC STAYING POWER AND SIGNIFICANT POPULAR </p><p>FOLLOWING FROM ASWAN TO ALEXANDRIA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>GETTING MIRED IN THE MAINSTREAM </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.   JOINING THE OPPOSITION DOLDRUMS:  THIS STATUS, </p><p>HOWEVER, REMAINS FAR FROM SATISFACTORY TO THE MB.  AS </p><p>IS TRUE FOR ALL EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION GROUPINGS, THE MB\'S </p><p>FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ACCESS TO THE MEDIA AND ASSEMBLY </p><p>DO NOT CONSTITUTE GENUINE POLITICAL ENFRANCHISEMENT. </p><p>LACKING THE RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY\'S (NDP) </p><p>ACCESS TO THE STATE BUREAUCRACY AND ITS ABILITY TO </p><p>DISTRIBUTE JOBS, EDUCATION, HOUSING, AND OTHER GOODS </p><p>AND SERVICES, THE MB (OR ANY OTHER OPPOSITION GROUPING) </p><p>IS UNLIKELY EVER TO BE VOTED INTO POWER, EVEN IF THE </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTRY WERE TO PERMIT GENUINE ELECTIONS. </p><p>THE MB AND OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES CAN OFFER ONLY </p><p>SLOGANS; THE RULING PARTY -- ANY RULING PARTY -- OFFERS </p><p>TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  DEFANGING:  THUS, AS THE REGIME MUST HAVE HOPED, </p><p>THE MB\'S PARTICIPATION IN THE FORMAL POLITICAL "SYSTEM" </p><p>OF THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS DEFANGED THE GROUP AS THE </p><p>PRETENDERS TO LEADERSHIP OF A NEW ISLAMIC ERA:  IN THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY AND IN THEIR PRESS, THEY HAVE LOOKED AND </p><p>SOUNDED MUCH LIKE THE OTHER OPPOSITION POLITICAL </p><p>PARTIES; THEY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED NO MORE THAN THE </p><p>OTHERS, AND HAVE PROVED NO MORE OF A THREAT TO THE </p><p>AUTHORITY OF THE STATE.  IN SUM, EVEN EGYPTIAN </p><p>SECULARISTS AND CHRISTIANS NO LONGER LIVE IN IMMEDIATE </p><p>DREAD OF THE MB.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE ISLAMICISTS </p><p>HAVE SHOWN GREATER INDEPENDENCE OF THE MB: NOW IN THE </p><p>LEGITIMATE POLITICAL THEATRE THERE ARE A GAGGLE OF MORE </p><p>PROMINENT ISLAMIC "INDEPENDENTS", AND A NEW (MORE OR </p><p>LESS FRIENDLY) RIVAL PARTY IN THE ISLAMIC WING OF THE </p><p>BELEAGUERED SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>EBBING OF REVOLUTIONARY ISLAM? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  EXTERNAL FACTORS -- IRAN:  THE DEFLATION OF THE </p><p>PERCEIVED THREAT FROM THE MB TAKES PLACE IN THE BROADER </p><p>CONTEXT OF A RELAXATION OF PERCEPTIONS OF A THREAT FROM </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY ISLAM IN GENERAL.  THE MB, LIKE EGYPT\'S </p><p>OTHER ISLAMIC POLITICIANS, EVIDENTLY FAILED IN THEIR </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO PICK AND CHOOSE ONLY THOSE ASPECTS OF </p><p>KHOMEINISM WITH WHICH THEY WISHED TO BE ASSOCIATED. </p><p>EVEN THOSE EGYPTIANS WHO PERCEIVE AND RESENT WESTERN </p><p>CULTURAL OR POLITICAL DOMINATION SEEM MORE REVOLTED BY </p><p>THE ISLAMIC "ALTERNATIVE" MODELED BY "HANGING JUDGE" </p><p>KHAMENEI, THE NEAR-HERESY AND VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH </p><p>SHI\'ISM, AND, PERHAPS MOST OF ALL, IRAN\'S PERCEIVED </p><p>"LOSS" OF THE WAR WITH IRAQ.  "NEITHER EAST NOR WEST" </p><p>-- A KHOMEINI SLOGAN BORROWED BY THE MB FOR ITS 1987 </p><p>ELECTION CAMPAIGN -- HAS A SUPERFICIAL APPEAL TO BOTH </p><p>LEFTIST AND ISLAMICIST INTELLECTUALS, BUT EVEN THEY </p><p>JOIN THE MASSES IN SETTING THE WEST AND EAST ON VERY </p><p>DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FRIENDSHIP AND ATTRACTION: FOR THE </p><p>VAST MAJORITY OF EGYPTIANS, THE WEST IS NO SATAN AND </p><p>THE EAST IS NO FRIEND.  THUS, EXCEPT AMONG THE </p><p>COMMITTED MINORITY, THE APPEAL OF POLITICAL ISLAM IN </p><p>EGYPT HAS FALLEN WITH ITS FORTUNES IN IRAN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  DOMESTIC SETBACKS:  OTHER UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS </p><p>HAVE ADDED TO THE MB\'S MISFORTUNES.  MOST </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY, THE CRASH OF THE ISLAMIC PONZI SCHEMES </p><p>IN 1988 DEALT A SHATTERING BLOW TO THE ATTRACTION OF </p><p>POLITICAL ISLAM TO THE LITTLE MAN, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>SOMEHOW HAS MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE ANTICIPATED BACKLASH </p><p>FROM THE THOUSANDS OF RUINED SMALL INVESTORS.  AS </p><p>RECOGNIZED CAPITALISTS, THE MB PERHAPS UNFAIRLY WAS </p><p>IDENTIFIED WITH THESE COMPANIES; IT HAD KNOWN CLOSE </p><p>TIES ONLY TO "SHERIF", THE MOST LEGITIMATE OF THE </p><p>"ISLAMIC" COMPANIES AND THE ONLY ONE THAT SEEMS TO HAVE </p><p>SURVIVED.  MOREOVER, THE ONGOING, BITTER FACTIONALISM </p><p>THAT SHATTERED THE SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY THIS SPRING </p><p>WAS WIDELY BLAMED ON THE INFECTION OF POLITICAL ISLAM </p><p>IN GENERAL, AND ON THE SLP\'S DALLIANCE WITH THE MB IN </p><p>PARTICULAR.  MEANWHILE, OVER THE PAST YEAR AND ONE </p><p>HALF, THE MB HAS FACED SHARP, SOMETIMES EVEN VIOLENT </p><p>ATTACK FROM ITS MORE EXTREME RIVALS FOR LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>POLITICAL ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>10.  FAILURES:  FINALLY, THE MB HAS HAD A STRING OF </p><p>PROGRAM FAILURES, PROBABLY AT LEAST PARTLY DUE TO THE </p><p>AGING LEADERSHIP\'S INABILITY TO CUT DEALS WITH STRONGER </p><p>ADVERSARIES.  THE MB LOST ITS TWO SEATS ON THE BOARD OF </p><p>THE LAWYERS\' SYNDICATE.  THEY FAILED TO NEGOTIATE WITH </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT EVEN A TOKEN SEAT IN THE SHURA COUNCIL </p><p>ELECTIONS AND APPOINTMENTS.  MOREOVER, AS THE </p><p>SECULARISTS ARE CROWING, THE MB HAVE LITTLE IN THE WAY </p><p>OF TANGIBLE ISLAMIC ACHIEVEMENT TO SHOW FOR THEIR TWO </p><p>YEARS IN PARLIAMENT:  THE MOST ONE MB DEPUTY COULD </p><p>CLAIM WAS SUCCESS IN "PRESENTING ISLAMIC IDEAS WITH </p><p>CLARITY."  IN PRIVATE, THE MB LEADERS ARE FAR MORE </p><p>DISGRUNTLED.  WE EXPECT THAT MANY IN THE MB WILL BE </p><p>REASSESSING THEIR STRATEGY OF PLAYING WITHIN THE </p><p>SYSTEM -- ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE INSULT AND INJURY </p><p>THEY SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE REGIME DURING THE </p><p>SHURA COUNCIL ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>WHOSE STRATEGIC SUCCESS? </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  DE-RADICALIZATION:  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MB\'S </p><p>PRESENT UNTHREATENING PUBLIC IMAGE MAY REPRESENT AS </p><p>IMPORTANT A STRATEGIC SUCCESS FOR THEM AS FOR THE </p><p>SECULAR STATE.  IF MUBARAK HAS WON HIS OBJECTIVE OF </p><p>DEFLATING THE REVOLUTIONARY THREAT FROM THE MB AND </p><p>EXTREMIST POLITICAL ISLAM, THE MB ALSO HAS COME FAR </p><p>TOWARD ITS GOAL OF LOOKING MODERATE, RESPONSIBLE, AND </p><p>ESTABLISHMENTARIAN.  SINCERE OR NOT, THE MB LEADERS\' </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS REITERATE THE GROUP\'S REJECTION OF </p><p>ASSOCIATION WITH KHOMEINISM, EGYPTIAN RADICAL GROUPS, </p><p>VIOLENCE, OR EVEN URGENCY IN THE ISLAMIC REFORMS FOR </p><p>WHICH THEY CALL.  THUS, WHILE EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTIES MARCH LEMMING-LIKE FOR THE EDGES OF PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION, THE MB CALMLY AND METHODICALLY AIMS FOR DEAD </p><p>CENTER.  IN FACT, BY EGYPTIAN STANDARDS, THE MB\'S </p><p>PROGRAM PUBLISHED DURING THE SHURA COUNCIL ELECTION </p><p>"CAMPAIGN" LAST MAY IS A MODEL OF BOTH RHETORICAL AND </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE MODERATION.  MANY OF ITS POINTS ARE NEAR OR </p><p>IDENTICAL TO NDP POSITIONS.  THUS THE MB DIRECTLY </p><p>CHALLENGE THE CLAIM OF THE REGIME AND ITS PARTY TO THE </p><p>LOYALTY OF THE MASS CENTER  -- PERHAPS ONE REASON THE </p><p>MB WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE SHURA COUNCIL IN 1989. </p><p>ALTHOUGH SUCH AN IDEOLOGICAL CHALLENGE HAS LITTLE </p><p>PROMISE OF SHAKING THE BEDROCK OF MASS PERSONAL AND </p><p>COMMUNAL INTERESTS THAT ADD UP TO SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>REGIME, IT MERITS EXAMINATION AS A REFLECTION OF THE </p><p>MB\'S READING OF THE MINDSET OF THE BROADER CONSTITUENCY </p><p>THEY MUST HOPE ONE DAY TO WREST FROM THE REGIME. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>THE MB\'S PROGRAM TODAY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE MOST RECENT, DETAILED AND COMPREHENSIVE </p><p>STATEMENT OF THE MB\'S PROGRAM WAS THEIR MAY 1989 SHURA </p><p>COUNCIL ELECTION PLATFORM (REF FBIS).  IT IS NOTABLY </p><p>SHORT ON ISLAMIC CANT AND LONG ON THE EVERYDAY, </p><p>LIBERAL, CENTRIST BROMIDES THAT ARE THE STUFF OF BOTH </p><p>THE WAFD AND THE NDP\'S PITCHES TO POPULAR POLITICAL </p><p>DEMANDS.  THE MB CANDIDATES PLEDGE TO FIGHT, "IN </p><p>SOLIDARITY WITH ALL HONORABLE ELEMENTS WITHIN THE </p><p>NATIONALIST FORCES," FOR ACHIEVEMENTS IN: </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL REFORM; GRADUAL IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>OF ISLAMIC LAW; ELIMINATING CORRUPTION; EDUCATION, </p><p>MEDICAL CARE, HOUSING AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES; </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS: </p><p> </p><p>-- CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL REFORM:  THE MB CALLS FOR </p><p>DIRECT ELECTION OF A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT FROM </p><p>AMONG SEVERAL CANDIDATES, AS WELL AS ELECTION OF MAYORS </p><p>AND GOVERNORS.  THEY WANT ABOLISHMENT OF THE EMERGENCY </p><p>LAW AND ALL OTHER "ANTI-DEMOCRATIC" LAWS AND PRACTICES; </p><p>COMPLETE FREEDOM FOR FORMATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES (IN </p><p>OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS, HOWEVER, THEY STATE THEIR </p><p>CONTINUING OPPOSITION TO THE NASSERITES, NO DOUBT DUE </p><p>TO THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL SCARS INFLICTED ON THEM </p><p>BY NASSER); SEPARATION OF THE RULING PARTY FROM STATE </p><p>ORGANS; GUARANTEES OF THE FAIRNESS OF ELECTIONS; AND </p><p>REPRESENTATION OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS  (IRONICALLY, </p><p>THE WESTERNIZED LIBERALS SUCH AS THE WAFDISTS SEE THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF THE UNEDUCATED AS ONE OF THE CRITICAL </p><p>WEAKNESSES OF EGYPTIAN "DEMOCRACY;" HERE, THE </p><p>PROPERTIED MB ARE CASTING A BONE TO THE LEFT.)  THEY </p><p>CALL FOR STRENGTHENING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE </p><p>JUDICIARY, AND PUTTING IT IN CHARGE OF PRISONS IN ORDER </p><p>TO END TORTURE AND INDEFINITE PREVENTATIVE DETENTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- ISLAMIC LAW:  THE MB CALL FOR "IMMEDIATE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION" OF THE ARTICLE OF THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>WHICH STATES THAT ISLAM IS THE RELIGION OF THE STATE </p><p>AND "THE PRINCIPLES OF ISLAM ARE THE MAIN SOURCE OF </p><p>LEGISLATION."  (MORE RADICAL ISLAMICISTS WANT THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION TO STATE THAT ISLAM IS THE ONLY/ONLY </p><p>SOURCE OF LEGISLATION.)  THEY DEFLATE THE URGENCY OF </p><p>THEIR APPEAL, HOWEVER, BY CALLING ONLY TO "BEGIN THE </p><p>REPEAL OF LAWS THAT CLEARLY VIOLATE ISLAMIC LAW."  TO </p><p>FURTHER ASSUAGE THE MODERATE CENTER, THEY EMPHASIZE </p><p>THAT "ISLAM IS A STATE AND CIVILIZATION OWNED BY ALL </p><p>WHO CONTRIBUTED TO IT.  THUS THE BROTHER COPTS IN </p><p>PARTICULAR AND THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK IN GENERAL HAVE </p><p>THE SAME RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AS MUSLIMS." </p><p> </p><p>-- CORRUPTION:  THE MB IDEALISTICALLY EXHORT PEOPLE, </p><p>ESPECIALLY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, TO BE GOOD, AND URGE </p><p>OFFICIAL ENCOURAGEMENT, EDUCATION, PROHIBITIONS AND </p><p>SANCTIONS TO THIS END.  SIGNIFICANTLY, THE MB DO </p><p>NOT/NOT CALL FOR THE "HUDUD" - CHOPPING OFF HANDS OF </p><p>THIEVES, STONING OF ADULTERERS, ETC, THAT THE RADICALS </p><p>PUT AT THE HEART OF ISLAMIC LAW.  THE MB WOULD CLOSE </p><p>ALL GOVERNMENT-OWNED ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE FACTORIES (NO </p><p>REFERENCE TO PRIVATELY OWNED PRODUCERS), STOP GAMBLING, </p><p>AND ISSUE NO MORE LICENSES FOR "BUFFOONERY AND </p><p>ENTERTAINMENT ON THE PRETEXT OF ENCOURAGING TOURISM." </p><p>PRESUMABLY, CURRENT LICENSES FOR BUFFOONERY WOULD BE </p><p>UNAFFECTED. </p><p> </p><p>-- EDUCATION AND CULTURE:  THE MB CALL FOR RADICAL </p><p>EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENT TO PERMIT EGYPT TO "FOLLOW THE </p><p>REQUIREMENTS OF THE SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION."  ANY CALL </p><p>FOR INTENSIFYING ISLAMIC INDOCTRINATION OR CENSORSHIP </p><p>IS NOTABLY OBSCURE, IF NOT ABSENT;  THE MB LIMIT </p><p>THEMSELVES TO URGING STATE PROPAGANDA EFFORTS AIMED AT </p><p>SPREADING RELIGIOUS VALUES AND OVERCOMING ALIENATION. </p><p>THEY ALSO CALL FOR FREEING THE MEDIA FROM GOVERNMENT </p><p>OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- SOCIAL SERVICES AND ECONOMIC REFORM:  THE MB URGE </p><p>"SERIOUS ... SOLUTIONS THAT DO NOT DEPEND ON THE </p><p>GUIDANCE OF THE IMF OR USAID."  THE STATE SHOULD </p><p>"BEWARE OF INTERFERENCE BY FOREIGNERS" IN ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICY AND "GUARD AGAINST THEIR CONTROL OF ECONOMIC AND </p><p>PRODUCTIVE GUIDANCE CENTERS."  DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE </p><p>BASED ON "SELF-RELIANCE" AND "ISLAMIC PRIORITIES." </p><p>THEY WOULD STOP PRINTING NEW BANKNOTES TO COVER THE </p><p>DEFICIT; REDUCE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ON LUXURIES; </p><p>"LIQUIDATE MONEY-LOSING ECONOMIC ESTABLISHMENTS"; </p><p>REFORM THE TAX SYSTEM TO SOAK THE RICH AND REDUCE THE </p><p>BURDEN ON THE POOR; RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE; MAINTAIN </p><p>SUBSIDIES OF BASIC COMMODITIES; AND ENCOURAGE THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR TO JOIN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN BUILDING </p><p>LOW- AND MEDIUM- INCOME HOUSING.  THE MB MAKE THE FIRST </p><p>CAMPAIGN REFERENCE WE HAVE SEEN IN EGYPT TO THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE, CALLING FOR REDUCING POLLUTION AS </p><p>A PREVENTATIVE MEDICAL STEP.  THEY WOULD ENCOURAGE </p><p>EGYPTIAN INVESTMENT IN EGYPT, AND COOOPERATE WITH ARAB </p><p>ECONOMIES, BUT THEY MAKE NO REFERENCE TO ENCOURAGING </p><p>"FOREIGN" (I.E. NON-ARAB) INVESTMENT.  ORGANS OF THE </p><p>STATE SHOULD "URGE" CITIZENS TO CONSUME LESS AND </p><p>PREVENT WASTE.  THE STATE SHOULD INTERVENE IN ECONOMIC </p><p>AFFAIRS, WITH LONG- AND SHORT- TERM PLANS.  THE PUBLIC </p><p>SECTOR IS THE "NERVE CENTER" OF THE ECONOMY, BUT IT </p><p>MUST GET OUT OF FIELDS THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN </p><p>HANDLE. </p><p> </p><p>-- FOREIGN RELATIONS:  THE MB SUPPORT THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>ARMED FORCES.  THEY URGE COMMITMENT TO THE NAM POLICY </p><p>OF "BALANCED RELATIONS WITH BOTH EAST AND WEST" (IN </p><p>CONTRAST TO THE ISOLATIONIST "NEITHER EAST NOR WEST" </p><p>LINE OF RADICAL ISLAM).  THEY MERELY URGE "CARE" IN </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., IN LIGHT OF ITS "FLAGRANT" </p><p>PRO-ISRAELI STANDS; "FREEZING", NOT ABROGATION, OF THE </p><p>CAMP DAVID ACCORDS; A "COMPREHENSIVE BOYCOTT OF THE </p><p>ISRAELI PRESENCE IN EGYPT,"  BUT WITHOUT CALLING FOR A </p><p>BREAK IN BILATERAL RELATIONS; AND CALL ONLY FOR SUPPORT </p><p>OF THE "POLITICAL JIHAD", NOT THE VIOLENT STRUGGLE, </p><p>"BEING WAGED BY OUR PALESTINIAN BROTHERS,"  AND OF </p><p>"THEIR RIGHT TO ESTABLISH THEIR INDEPENDENT STATE ON </p><p>THEIR SOIL."  THEY OPPOSE FRAGMENTATION AND </p><p>SECTARIANISM IN LEBANON AND SECESSIONISM IN SUDAN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>MUTUAL BENEFIT OF THE MB-GOVERNMENT DEAL </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  CONCLUSION:  BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND MB EVIDENTLY </p><p>HAVE GOT MUCH OF WHAT THEY WANTED FROM THEIR 1987 </p><p>DEAL:  THE MB GAINED SOMETHING CLOSE TO LEGITIMACY, </p><p>ACCESS TO THE NATIONAL MEDIA (INCLUDING TELEVISED </p><p>PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY DEBATES), AND A VALUABLE IMMUNITY </p><p>FROM OUTRIGHT REPRESSION, REGARDLESS OF THE INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER\'S OUTSPOKEN VIEWS.  THEIR POSITION AS THE ONLY </p><p>PLAUSIBLE ISLAMIC POLITICAL MOVEMENT, HOWEVER WEAK, IS </p><p>STRENGTHENED:  WITH THEIR PRIVATE WEALTH, LINGERING </p><p>MASS APPEAL, DISCIPLINE, AND AT LEAST A FEW DEDICATED </p><p>YOUTHFUL LEADERS WAITING IN THE WINGS, THE MB ARE MORE </p><p>LIKELY THAN ANY OF THE ESTABLISHED PARTIES TO ENDURE AS </p><p>A FORCE IN EGYPTIAN POLITICS.  FOR THE REGIME\'S PART, </p><p>IN RETURN FOR ENDURING MORE VOCAL PUBLIC CRITICISM FROM </p><p>ISLAMIC POLITICAL QUARTERS, IT HAS SPLIT THE ISLAMIC </p><p>OPPOSITION INTO A COMFORTABLY-MANAGED MAINSTREAM </p><p>ELEMENT (THE MB) AND A "CRIMINAL" ELEMENT ("THE ISLAMIC </p><p>GROUP" AND THE LIKE) THAT IT IS STERNLY REPRESSING WITH </p><p>LITTLE SIGN OF BROAD PUBLIC REACTION.  MEANWHILE, AS </p><p>ALL THIS OCCURS AT THE RAREFIED POLITICAL LEVELS, A </p><p>CULTURAL RELIGIOUS REVIVAL CONTINUES IN FITS AND STARTS </p><p>IN THE BROADER EGYPTIAN SOCIETY.  THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS </p><p>TO HAVE MUCH MORE INFLUENCE ON THAT LARGER CULTURAL </p><p>PROCESS THAN HAVE THE MB, OR ANY OTHER POLITICAL OR </p><p>RELIGIOUS GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WISNER </p><p></p></div>
