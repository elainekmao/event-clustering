END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>PARLIAMENT OPENS </p><p>---------------- </p><p>2.  Parliament resumed on May 6, after a two-month </p><p>adjournment.  Top among the bills for debate in this final </p><p>sitting of the Third Session of the Fifth Parliament are </p><p>amendments to the Access to Information and Protection of </p><p>Privacy Amendment Bill and the Electoral Amendment Bill.  The </p><p>bills were announced in the official Zimbabwe journal--the </p><p>first step in the bill making process--in October and March </p><p>2002, respectively, and are at the Parliamentary Legal </p><p>Committee (PLC) stage.  The Access to Information Bill was </p><p>referred to the PLC in November and no report has yet been </p><p>issued.  The Electoral Amendment Bill received an adverse </p><p>report. </p><p> </p><p>NOTE: According to the Parliamentary process, bills are fist </p><p>published (gazetted) in the government gazette at least two </p><p>weeks before they are introduced in Parliament.  After </p><p>gazetting, the bill is referred to the appropriate </p><p>parliamentary portfolio committee, which assesses whether the </p><p>bill is practical and then conducts a hearing with members of </p><p>the public to get their input.  Independent of the portfolio </p><p>committee, the appropriate minister makes the first reading </p><p>of the bill before the House and then the bill is referred to </p><p>the Parliamentary Legal Committee--the committee charged with </p><p>determining the constitutionality of the bill.  At the second </p><p>reading stage, the minister explains the bill, the portfolio </p><p>committee presents its report, and debate on the bill </p><p>follows.  After the second reading, the House goes through </p><p>the bill line by line and adopts any changes to it before it </p><p>proceeds to the third reading when Parliament passes the bill </p><p>and it goes to the Head of State for assent into law.  END </p><p>NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>AIPPA </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>3. The Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act </p><p>(AIPPA) became law in March 2002.  The Act places Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>independent journalists and media companies under government </p><p>control and restricts the operation of foreign journalists </p><p>and media in Zimbabwe.  (See Reftel).  Critics of the bill </p><p>contend that it contravenes the constitutional right of </p><p>freedom of expression and is meant to gag the independent </p><p>media.  The Independent Journalists Association of Zimbabwe </p><p>(IJAZ) is challenging the constitutionality of AIPPA, but no </p><p>judgment has yet been rendered by the Supreme Court.  IJAZ </p><p>challenges the accreditation of journalists as being </p><p>arbitrary and an impediment to journalists practicing their </p><p>craft.  IJAZ also contends that AIPPA puts the journalism </p><p>profession under government control.  Supreme Court Chief </p><p>Justice Chidyausiku, whose allegiance to President Robert </p><p>Mugabe is without question, is believed to be sitting on the </p><p>case.  The Media Institute of Southern Africa, an NGO </p><p>dedicated to the promotion of free, independent, and </p><p>pluralistic media, is now running a &Justice delayed is </p><p>justice denied8 campaign through advertisements in the local </p><p>papers. </p><p> </p><p>4. If passed, the amendments would expand the list of mass </p><p>media products under the government\'s control to include </p><p>electronically transmitted materials and periodically printed </p><p>publications; tighten the restrictions on foreign media </p><p>operations and limit accreditation of foreign journalists to </p><p>a 30-day period; and remove the provision for journalists and </p><p>media houses to nominate members to the Mass Media Commission </p><p>(MMC). </p><p> </p><p>--Expanding the List of Monitored Products: The bill proposes </p><p>to extend the provisions of AIPPA to a wider segment of </p><p>society by inserting a number of new definitions.  The </p><p>amendment expands the list of definitions that apply to the </p><p>whole Act by moving some that were originally applicable to </p><p>the regulation of mass media services.  As written, the bill </p><p>could cover the publication of and contributors to church </p><p>magazines, bank newsletters, and web pages.  The bill could </p><p>also conceivably regulate private advertisements, e-mails, </p><p>and web pages. </p><p> </p><p>--Restricting Journalistic Access: The amendment limits the </p><p>time in which foreign journalists may be accredited to thirty </p><p>days.  AIPPA states only that accreditation will be for a </p><p>limited time.  The amendment also permits a foreign mass </p><p>media service to set up an office for twelve months. </p><p> </p><p>--Removing the Journalist Nominations to MMC: The amendment </p><p>would get rid of the requirement that the association of </p><p>journalists and media houses nominate at least three of the </p><p>five to nine members on the commission.  Prior to passing </p><p>AIPPA in March 2002, ZANU-PF MP and Chairman of the PLC </p><p>Eddison Zvobgo fought to include the provision that </p><p>journalists nominate at least three members. </p><p> </p><p>5. The committee responsible for reviewing the AIPPA </p><p>amendments, the Portfolio Committee on Transport and </p><p>Communication, completed a report in mid-February in which </p><p>they expressed concern that the general implications of the </p><p>amendments go against the ideas of encouraging media </p><p>businesses to operate.  The Committee pointed out that </p><p>accreditation denies publishers the certainty of knowing the </p><p>journalists they employ will be able to work.  The Minister </p><p>of Information is given the power to determine for how long a </p><p>journalist will be in employment.  The Committee also </p><p>reported that: </p><p>     -Accreditation forces journalists to live in fear of </p><p>being arrested, </p><p>     -The amendment stifles the smooth flow of business with </p><p>its two-year licenses for media houses, </p><p>     -The $Z500,000 registration fee is excessive, </p><p>     -The Media Commission should be representative of and </p><p>accountable to the profession, and </p><p>     -The Commission should be independent of the politics of </p><p>the day, lest it use its power to censor journalists. </p><p>(NOTE: The Committee comprises five MDC parliamentarians </p><p>(MP), five ZANU-PF MPs, and a chief from Binga in </p><p>Matabeleland North, an overwhelmingly MDC stronghold.  An MDC </p><p>MP is chairperson.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. The Electoral Amendment Bill incorporates many of the </p><p>clauses that were in the General Laws Amendment Act, passed </p><p>in January 2002, but subsequently declared invalid by the </p><p>Supreme Court just before the 2002 Presidential elections. </p><p>The Bill received an adverse report from the PLC, but it </p><p>remains to be seen how the ruling party will handle it. </p><p>(NOTE: In January 2002, the PLC issued an adverse report on </p><p>AIPPA, which resulted in Zvobgo butting heads with Jonathan </p><p>Moyo, the Minister responsible for AIPPA, and Patrick </p><p>Chinamasa, Minister of Justice.  After several weeks of </p><p>Zvobgo refusing to table the report in the House, the PLC and </p><p>Chinamasa conferred for two weeks to resolve some of the </p><p>issues Zvobgo and the PLC had with the Bill.  In the end, the </p><p>PLC tabled the bill and Parliament passed AIPPA. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>7. The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Justice, Legal, </p><p>and Parliamentary Affairs held a public hearing on March 13, </p><p>in which all the high level MPs on the committee and </p><p>representatives from Zimbabwe Election Support Network, the </p><p>Electoral Supervisory Commission (ESC), the National </p><p>Constitutional Assembly, the Registrar-General (RG), and the </p><p>MDC election directorate were present.  The Committee </p><p>comprises five MDC MPs, four ZANU-PF MPs, one ZANU-Ndonga MP, </p><p>and two chiefs.  A ZANU-PF MP chairs the committee. </p><p>According to a March preliminary report on submission on the </p><p>Bill, none of the stakeholders was satisfied with the Bill as </p><p>it is currently written. </p><p> </p><p>8. Some of the proposed Electoral Act changes include: </p><p> </p><p>-Giving the ESC exclusive power to appoint and accredit </p><p>election monitors whom the Registrar-General must verify. </p><p>The amendment stipulates that monitors be drawn from the </p><p>public service cohort. In the past, the ESC drew monitors </p><p>from civic society organizations and did not need to furnish </p><p>the RG with proof of their appointment. </p><p> </p><p>-Vesting the power to invite election observers in two </p><p>ministers, the Minister of Foreign Affairs for foreigners and </p><p>the Minister of Justice for Zimbabweans.  In the past, the </p><p>ESC accredited local observers and the Election Directorate </p><p>accredited foreign observers.  The Ministry of Information </p><p>decided which foreign journalists would be allowed to report </p><p>on elections.  (COMMENT: This particular minister would </p><p>certainly use this clause to go against media houses and </p><p>individual journalists from the foreign media.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>-Making the ESC solely responsible for voter education. </p><p>However, political parties may still provide their own voter </p><p>education programs.  The amendment makes it a criminal </p><p>offense, with a penalty of $Z10,000 and/or six months </p><p>imprisonment, to provide voter education without ESC </p><p>registration or to receive foreign funds for said voter </p><p>education.  Previously, there were no restrictions on civic </p><p>organizations conducting voter education and they were to </p><p>receive local and foreign funding.  This clause is meant to </p><p>limit the content of voter education and the process itself. </p><p> </p><p>-Restricting postal voting to members and their spouses away </p><p>on duty with the disciplined forces or government service and </p><p>officials and spouses away on election duty.  In the past, </p><p>persons unable to go to polling stations because of ill </p><p>health or infirmity; residing more than 20 kilometers from </p><p>the nearest polling stations; and those who had good reason </p><p>to believe they would not be in their constituency on polling </p><p>day were allowed to vote by mail.  Zimbabweans studying or </p><p>temporarily working outside the country could apply to vote </p><p>by mail. </p><p> </p><p>-Allowing electoral officers to seal and open ballot boxes </p><p>and count votes even if all the monitors, observers, election </p><p>and polling agents who are entitled to be present are not. </p><p>(COMMENT: In the 2002 presidential elections, polling agents </p><p>and civil society observers were barred from observing </p><p>counting in some areas.  The GOZ now seeks to legitimize this </p><p>practice.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>-Making it a criminal offense to place a bill, placard, </p><p>poster, pamphlet, etc. on any house, building, wall, fence, </p><p>lamppost, gate, or elevator without the consent of the owner. </p><p> The penalty is a fine of up to $Z100,000 and/or imprisonment </p><p>for up to five years. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>OTHER BILLS </p><p>----------- </p><p>9. On February 14, the Citizenship of Zimbabwe Amendment Bill </p><p>was gazetted.  The bill exempts persons of Southern African </p><p>Development Community parentage, who may be citizens of these </p><p>countries by descent, from compliance with the dual </p><p>citizenship prohibition and the requirement to renounce the </p><p>foreign citizenship in order to keep Zimbabwean citizenship. </p><p>The bill also stipulates that the SADC parent immigrated into </p><p>or the Zimbabwean parent emigrated out of Zimbabwe to work as </p><p>a general laborer, farm laborer, mineworker, or domestic </p><p>employee in order for the exemption to apply.  COMMENT: The </p><p>Citizenship Amendment Bill appears to be a way for ZANU-PF to </p><p>try and regain the support of Zimbabweans of SADC heritage. </p><p>In its carefully worded text, the Bill deliberately excludes </p><p>white Zimbabweans from claiming citizenship without first </p><p>denouncing a GOZ-perceived allegiance to the country of </p><p>ancestry.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  On March 14, the Minister of Justice, Chinamasa, </p><p>gazetted the disbursement of money to the MDC and ZANU-PF </p><p>under the Political Parties (Finance) Act.  The allocation </p><p>covers the year June 26, 2002 to June 25, 2003 and is based </p><p>upon the number of votes cast for the party\'s candidates in </p><p>the preceding general election (June 2000) or in </p><p>by-elections.  ZANU-PF was allocated Z$127.5 million (51 </p><p>percent of total votes cast) and MDC allocated Z$122.5 </p><p>million (49 percent of total votes cast). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>11. If the amendments to AIPPA pass, they would make the </p><p>draconian laws on journalistic freedom even more repressive. </p><p>The independent media continues to be a problem for the GOZ, </p><p>and this would provide the GOZ a way to further limit the </p><p>independent media\'s influence.  As drafted, the amendment is </p><p>vague and open to broad interpretation.  It also seeks to </p><p>frustrate the independent media and limit its ability to </p><p>appeal freely. </p><p> </p><p>12. If passed, the Electoral Act Amendment Bill would block </p><p>any move towards a freer electoral environment.  If the GOZ </p><p>is allowed to decide whom to invite as observers, there is </p><p>the likelihood that the system will be politically </p><p>manipulated, since the Ministers could only invite foreign </p><p>journalists and observers who are perceived to be sympathetic </p><p>to the government of the day and who will turn a blind eye to </p><p>any election irregularities.  The clause about putting up </p><p>campaign posters makes it almost impossible for </p><p>electioneering materials to be posted prior to an election. </p><p>It is unreasonable and impractical to demand that the </p><p>permission of the municipality or the property owner outside </p><p>whose property the material is to be posted be given for </p><p>every posting. Given the propensity for selective application </p><p>of the law by the GOZ, ZANU-PF candidates will no doubt be </p><p>allowed to put up posters, while MDC and other opposition </p><p>posters will be met with the full might of the law. END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
