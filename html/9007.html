<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 OTTAWA 001812 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE for EB/ESC/IEC, WHA/CAN, NP/NE </p><p>DEPT pass USTR (Chandler) </p><p> </p><p>USDOC For ITA/MAC - Office of NAFTA Affairs </p><p> </p><p>DOE for Int\'l and Policy (Person), IE-141 (Deutsch) and BPA </p><p>(Atkins) </p><p> </p><p>Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of International </p><p>Programs (Rosales-Bush) </p><p> </p><p>DOE For Energy Information Administration </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EMIN, ETRD, ENRG, KNNP, CA </p><p>SUBJECT: Canada\'s Uranium: A primer </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. Canada is the largest uranium producer in the world - in </p><p>2002 production was 11,607 metric tonnes of uranium, about </p><p>one-third of total world production.  Canada typically </p><p>provides 20 to 30 percent of uranium used in the United </p><p>States.  The two main players are Cameco, a Canadian-based </p><p>publicly traded company and COGEMA, the mining arm of the </p><p>international nuclear group, AREVA. Despite low uranium </p><p>prices in the late 1990\'s and early 2000\'s, these mining </p><p>firms have invested in new mines and plants, and the </p><p>development of new high-grade deposits means that Canadian </p><p>producers are well positioned to capitalize on future market </p><p>opportunities.  With U.S. electric utilities looking to </p><p>extend their existing plant operating licenses, increase </p><p>("uprate") their power output, and possibly build new </p><p>nuclear plants, Canada\'s uranium deposits may become even </p><p>more significant for U.S. energy interests in the coming </p><p>years.  Concern does exist within the Canadian uranium </p><p>mining industry, however, that low uranium prices will </p><p>curtail exploration and could scuttle plans to bring new </p><p>deposits fully on line.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>CANADA\'S URANIUM DEPOSITS & PRODUCTION </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Canada is the world\'s largest producer of uranium. In </p><p>2002, production, at 13,689 metric tonnes (t) of uranium </p><p>oxide concentrate (representing 11,607 t Uranium), was about </p><p>a third of total world production. Its value was about C$ </p><p>600 million.  All of the active mines, as well as the vast </p><p>reserves, are located in the Athabasca basin region in the </p><p>northernmost quarter of the province of Saskatchewan. </p><p> </p><p>3. Canada\'s low cost uranium reserves (Reasonably Assured </p><p>Resources plus Estimated Additional Resources) are 515,000 </p><p>metric tonnes of uranium oxide (U3O8) (437,000 tonnes </p><p>Uranium, 14 percent of world total).  (Note that Australia </p><p>has approximately double the reserves of Canada.) </p><p> </p><p>4. Some C$539 million (one C$ currently equals approximately </p><p>US$0.74) was spent on uranium exploration in Canada from </p><p>1986 to 1997 and this led to a sharp increase in recoverable </p><p>resources. Despite depletion from mining, resources have </p><p>further increased slightly since 1997.  Exploration </p><p>expenditure in 1998 was C$60 million, then $49 million in </p><p>1999 and 2000, mostly at established projects. </p><p> </p><p>5. Australia\'s uranium reserves are the world\'s largest, </p><p>with 28% of the world\'s total (estimated at about 750,000 </p><p>metric tonnes of uranium).  Australia is the world\'s second- </p><p>largest producer of uranium, responsible for about 19% of </p><p>total global production in 2002, with 6888 metric tones of </p><p>uranium.  In 2002 the United States was the world\'s eighth </p><p>ranked producer of uranium, producing 919 metric tonnes of </p><p>uranium from mines (as opposed to use of HEU from former </p><p>national military stockpiles). </p><p> </p><p>6. Currently, Canada supplies 20 to 30 percent of uranium </p><p>used in the United States - typically this is shipped to the </p><p>United States as Uranium Hexaflouride, which is then </p><p>enriched to become fuel for American light water reactors. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>THE MAJOR PLAYERS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. Two producers account for over 90 percent of Canadian </p><p>uranium production. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco is </p><p>the largest producer in the world with 5479 metric tonnes of </p><p>uranium produced in Canada in 2002.  Cameco was created in </p><p>1988 by the merger of two government corporations, the </p><p>Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation and El Dorado </p><p>Nuclear Limited.  Cameco is now fully owned by private </p><p>investors after the government of Saskatchewan sold its 10 </p><p>percent share in 2002.  The company\'s 56 million shares are </p><p>traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol - CCO) and the </p><p>New York Stock Exchange (symbol - CCJ).  Cameco also </p><p>operates uranium mines in Wyoming and Nebraska.  The company </p><p>produces nuclear electricity as an owner of, and the sole </p><p>fuel supplier to, Bruce Power\'s operating nuclear reactors </p><p>in Ontario (four currently operating, two soon to re-start). </p><p> </p><p>8. Uranium ore mined by Cameco in Saskatchewan is milled </p><p>into "yellowcake" (a uranium oxide concentrate) at </p><p>facilities also located in northern Saskatchewan.  The </p><p>milled "yellowcake" is then shipped to Cameco\'s refining </p><p>plant at Blind River, Ontario and conversion plant at Port </p><p>Hope, Ontario for processing into uranium dioxide for use as </p><p>fuel in the Canadian built heavy-water "CANDU" reactors </p><p>located in Canada, Korea, China, and elsewhere. The Port </p><p>Hope facility also produces uranium hexafluoride which is </p><p>shipped to the United States and elsewhere for enrichment </p><p>into fuel for light-water reactors.  The facility at Port </p><p>Hope has a capacity to convert 12,500 metric tonnes of </p><p>uranium per year into uranium hexaflouride. </p><p> </p><p>9.   COGEMA Resources Incorporated (CRI) is a wholly owned </p><p>subsidiary of Paris-based COGEMA, itself wholly owned by the </p><p>international nuclear industrial group, AREVA.  CRI is the </p><p>second largest producer of uranium in Canada, with 5425 </p><p>metric tonnes of uranium produced in 2002. CRI\'s activities </p><p>in Canada are limited to mining and milling uranium into </p><p>yellowcake; CRI has no conversion facilities in Canada, but </p><p>exports yellowcake for conversion and enrichment (to France </p><p>and the United States).  CRI\'s principal mines are McClean </p><p>Lake, and its part ownership in the mines at Cigar Lake and </p><p>McArthur River, all in Saskatchewan. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>NEW HIGH GRADE MINES STARING TO PRODUCE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Canada is in the midst of a transition from second- </p><p>generation uranium mines (started 1975-83) to new high-grade </p><p>ones, all in northwestern Saskatchewan.  In 1999-2000, mines </p><p>at McArthur River and McClean Lake commenced production, </p><p>producing some 3700 metric tonnes of uranium and 2300 tonnes </p><p>of uranium respectively.  Three more mines (Cigar Lake, </p><p>Midwest and Dawn Lake) are planned.  The Cigar Lake mine is </p><p>closest to opening and is expected to produce 7000 metric </p><p>tonnes of uranium annually once it is on line, around 2006. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING URANIUM INDUSTRY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>11.  Production at Cameco\'s McArthur River mine, said to be </p><p>the world\'s largest, was temporarily suspended in April 2003 </p><p>due to underground flooding.  Cameco anticipates that </p><p>production at McArthur River will resume in July 2003.  The </p><p>company forecasts that 2003 net earnings will decline by $4 </p><p>to $5 million for every month the mine remains inoperable. </p><p>However, Cameco expects to fully deliver on its 2003 sales </p><p>contracts through its inventory and other supply sources. </p><p> </p><p>12.  The first labor dispute in the history of Canada\'s </p><p>uranium mining industry ended after a brief, five-day work </p><p>stoppage in June 2003.  Unionized workers at CRI demanded </p><p>wage increases to be on par with their counterparts at </p><p>Cameco.  Though still below Cameco pay levels, CRI workers </p><p>negotiated a 10.5 percent increase in wages over a three- </p><p>year term.  The short stoppage is not expected to affect </p><p>CRI\'s production forecasts. </p><p> </p><p>13.  CRI is currently appealing a September 2002 Canadian </p><p>Federal Court ruling that cancelled their 1999 operating </p><p>license for the McClean Lake project on the grounds that CRI </p><p>had not conducted an adequate environmental review under the </p><p>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.  In November 2002, </p><p>the Federal Court of Appeal granted a stay of the previous </p><p>decision while the case is appealed.  Currently, the McClean </p><p>Lake mine is operating under a four-year operating license </p><p>issued in 2001 that increased the mine\'s production capacity </p><p>up to 3600 metric tonnes of U3O8 per year.  A shutdown of </p><p>the McClean Lake mine would eliminate a significant portion </p><p>of CRI\'s current uranium production. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>SECURITY OF URANIUM SUPPLY WILL REQUIRE PRICE INCREASE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  It is not a sure bet, however, that Cigar Lake, Midwest </p><p>and Dawn lake will come on stream as scheduled - or that </p><p>other new resources will be developed.  During a speech to </p><p>investors in March 2003, the CEO of Cameco, Gerald Grandey, </p><p>noted that forecast uranium production will fall short of </p><p>the uranium market\'s requirements by 300 million pounds over </p><p>the next 10 years.  Although secondary sources (such as </p><p>inventory from ex-military stockpiles) do provide a </p><p>significant amount of uranium for fuel, this contribution, </p><p>according to uranium industry advocates, is still not </p><p>sufficient to make up the shorfall in uranium supply. </p><p>Grandey\'s analysis is that the capital investment needed to </p><p>cover the deficit "will require higher sustained prices" and </p><p>that he is "convinced it is a case of when, not if, prices </p><p>improve."  Currently, the spot price of uranium is </p><p>recovering from an historic low of US$7 per pound in 2000 to </p><p>almost US$11 per pound currently (though far from the high- </p><p>water marks of US$16 per pound in 1988 and 1996). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15. Canada\'s high-grade uranium deposits in northern </p><p>Saskatchewan offer a secure fuel supply for American nuclear </p><p>power plants.  To ensure that known deposits are brought to </p><p>production, and to encourage further exploration will, </p><p>however, require an increase in the price of uranium, </p><p>according to industry analysts.  GoC officials and industry </p><p>contacts remain interested in maintaining a close dialogue </p><p>with USG in order to address important uranium market issues </p><p>and presumably to encourage uranium industry investment in </p><p>mines and exploration. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
