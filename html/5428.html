Reasons:  1.5 (B and </p><p>D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) "Prime Minister" </p><p>Barham Salih briefed Operation Northern Watch POLAD in Ankara </p><p>Jan. 29 and 31 on his recent travel in Europe and his Jan. 30 </p><p>meetings with Turkish officials.  Salih said his talks with </p><p>Turks were mostly positive, with the exception of the Turkmen </p><p>issue.  Salih told the Turks he believed Turkey was making a </p><p>"big mistake" by tying themselves only to the Iraqi Turkmen </p><p>Front (ITF).  In the long run Turkey would need the support </p><p>and friendship of Iraqi Kurds and Arabs more than the </p><p>Turkmen, who would always support Turkey in any case.  In </p><p>addition, he told the Turks, the ITF was defining Turkmen </p><p>rights on an anti-Kurd platform, an unhelpful and dangerous </p><p>move that indicated the ITF\'s political immaturity.  MFA </p><p>Under Secretary Ziyal told Salih that Turkey would permit </p><p>journalists to transit Turkey en route to the February </p><p>opposition conference in northern Iraq.  Finally, echoing </p><p>what Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Barzani told us </p><p>January 9 (reftel), Salih objected to Turkish troops </p><p>participating in military operations in northern Iraq unless </p><p>under US command, and even then, he was uncomfortable with </p><p>the notion.  "They are looking for a mission.  We don\'t want </p><p>to be their mission."  Salih said he hoped PUK leader Jalal </p><p>Talabani could discuss this bilaterally with Amb. Khalilzad </p><p>in Ankara on Feb. 6.  Salih also raised the release of Ansar </p><p>al-Islam leader Mullah Krekar and the PUK\'s current economic </p><p>crisis.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>PUK Raises Turkmen Problems with GOT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) PUK "PM" Barham Salih briefed ONW POLAD January 29 and </p><p>31 on his travel to Europe and his Jan. 30 meetings with </p><p>Turkish MFA, TGS and TNIO officials.  He characterized his </p><p>meetings with Turks as good, with one problematic issue: the </p><p>Iraqi Turkmen.  Salih told the Turks they needed to cultivate </p><p>friendships with the Iraqi Arabs and Kurds, and that Turkey\'s </p><p>limited focus on Iraqi Turkmen was alienating other Iraqis. </p><p>"People in Iraq are exasperated with the Turks" he told us. </p><p>"We know they are one of the keys to our future and provide a </p><p>good example of secular democracy, but Turkish support of the </p><p>ITF and discussion of Turkish military involvement in Iraq </p><p>are creating many complications."  Calling the ITF </p><p>politically immature, Salih complained that ITF leaders are </p><p>defining Turkmen rights on an anti-Kurd platform, which was </p><p>ultimately dangerous, given Turkey\'s support for the ITF and </p><p>plans for military presence in northern Iraq.  Salih said the </p><p>KDP, PUK and other Iraqi opposition groups should give Turkey </p><p>assurances on everything they want, including on Kirkuk, to </p><p>avoid Turkish military involvement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Salih Opposes TGS Involvement in Iraq </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Salih asked us if Turks in northern Iraq would be </p><p>under US military command.  When we told him we could not </p><p>answer that question at this stage and urged him and/or </p><p>Talabani to raise the matter with Presidential Special Envoy </p><p>Khalilzad during the latter\'s visit here Feb. 5-6, Salih </p><p>replied that he had consistently told US officials that he </p><p>and the PUK would be concerned about any increased Turkish </p><p>military presence in northern Iraq.  "They have no business </p><p>there."  Such a presence could only be acceptable under US </p><p>command, and even that made the Iraqi Kurds uncomfortable. </p><p>Repeating some themes raised with us by KDP leader Barzani </p><p>reftel, Salih said if the Turkish military comes into </p><p>northern Iraq, they will never leave.  Their presence will </p><p>draw in the Iranians, he said.  They will try to force the </p><p>undemocratic ITF down the Kurds\' throats and restrict Iraqi </p><p>Kurds\' political aspirations.  In short, he said, the Turkish </p><p>military "is looking for a mission.  We do not want to be </p><p>their mission." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Views on US-Turkey-Iraqi Kurds Talks </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) When we discussed the Feb. 5-6 multi-party talks to be </p><p>led on the US side by PSE Khalilzad, Salih said the Iraqi </p><p>Kurds were interested in talking with the Turks about what </p><p>happens during military operations, but not about what </p><p>post-Saddam Iraq would look like.  He said if the Turks think </p><p>they have a say in that discussion they will think they can </p><p>"run" northern Iraq.  "That discussion is for Iraqis, not </p><p>foreigners."  He was very firm on the point and said that the </p><p>Turks want the Iraqi Kurds to be Iraqis first.  But when they </p><p>behave like Iraqis and try to discuss Iraq\'s future, Turkey </p><p>identifies them as Kurds and insists on inserting itself in a </p><p>discussion where Turkey does not belong.  Turkey, he said, </p><p>cannot have it both ways on this point.  Salih said that </p><p>including the ITF - even as observers - in the multi-party </p><p>talks will complicate things and could degenerate into </p><p>KDP-ITF bickering.  But more seriously, inclusion of the ITF </p><p>would give the Turks baseless claims to insist on getting </p><p>their way on every point "to protect the interests of the </p><p>Turkmen."  That said, he realized we may need to find a way </p><p>to check the ITF box in order to keep the Turks in the talks, </p><p>but he was decidedly unenthusiastic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Turks: Conference Invite Should Come From KDP/PUK/ITF </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Turning to the upcoming Iraqi opposition conference, </p><p>Salih said MFA U/S Ziyal told him Turkey would permit </p><p>journalists to attend via Turkey.  Salih invited Ziyal to </p><p>send a GOT rep to the conference.  Ziyal said he would </p><p>consider the invitation.  TGS, Salih said, pushed him to have </p><p>the invitation to the conference jointly issued and signed by </p><p>KDP leader Barzani, PUK leader Talabani and ITF leader Sanan </p><p>Aga.  Salih told us the PUK was considering having the </p><p>invitation issued by all the opposition groups based in Iraq </p><p>to avoid a problem over this.  He said that including the ITF </p><p>in all the Advisory Committee sub-groups should not be a </p><p>problem.  "It is in our interest to have the ITF in all of </p><p>the opposition work, but not to have them shoved down our </p><p>throats by outsiders."  He noted that ITF leader Aga had in </p><p>the past supported autonomy for the region of "Iraqi </p><p>Kurdistan" and had even served on the region\'s autonomous </p><p>legislative council before the Gulf War.  That he now was </p><p>opposed to autonomy for the region was an interesting </p><p>indicator of his own lack of autonomy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Readout from Davos - Surprising Support </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Salih said that the Iraqi opposition delegation at </p><p>Davos, in which he participated, got a great hearing and </p><p>spoke to a large and surprisingly supportive crowd.  He </p><p>complained that the European governments are "useless" on </p><p>Iraq.  He said that KDP/PUK cooperation was excellent and </p><p>that there was no way the parties would return to </p><p>confrontation with each other during hostilities.  "Those who </p><p>suggest so are hoping we will, but we\'re all playing this </p><p>smart."  The KDP and the PUK finally opened liaison offices </p><p>in each other\'s territory last week, fulfilling a Washington </p><p>Agreement reconciliation requirement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Mullah Krekar - Offer of Additional Info </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Salih asked us why the Dutch had released Ansar </p><p>al-Islam leader Mullah Krekar and why the US had not tried to </p><p>extradited him.  Salih suggested Krekar had al-Qaeda </p><p>connections that should be sufficient for the US to hold him. </p><p> Salih offered to provide any info necessary to help get him </p><p>in appropriate custody and said that Krekar and his relatives </p><p>are desparately looking for a way to get Krekar back to </p><p>Biyara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>PUK Econ Crisis - Appeal for Currency Assistance </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Finally, Salih said that the PUK regional </p><p>administration was in urgent need of economic assistance, was </p><p>grateful for what it had already received, but was now unable </p><p>to pay for public services and had a major currency crisis. </p><p>He said they could in theory go to a mostly USD-based economy </p><p>(many salaries are already paid in dollars), but they had </p><p>virtually no small denomination bills which made it </p><p>impossible to use the USD for daily commerce.  He asked if we </p><p>could help infuse into the region small USD bills.  He also </p><p>said the UK is holding a large amount of frozen Iraqi </p><p>accounts in old dinars and wondered whether there was any </p><p>chance of getting those released into circulation.  He said </p><p>he would follow up on this matter by phone with appropriate </p><p>USG officials. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
