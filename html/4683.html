(SBU) Summary: Jade mining and smuggling are big business </p><p>in Kachin State.  Concession sales provide revenue for both </p><p>the government and the Kachin ethnic cease-fire groups. </p><p>However, little trickles down to the average citizen.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>Jade Mining Ain\'t What it Used to Be </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Kachin State has the world\'s only pure jadeite </p><p>mines.  However, according to Kachin jade miners and various </p><p>community leaders, the jade industry is not what it used to </p><p>be.  In the past, the jade mines (focused on the town of Hpa </p><p>Kant, northwest of Myitkyina) were the employer of last </p><p>resort for local people.  If all else failed, it was always </p><p>possible for an individual to try his luck at jade mining. </p><p>Now, the jade mines have been re-organized by the government </p><p>to cater to larger mining companies that rely more on heavy </p><p>machinery than manpower.  While this has cleaned up the wild </p><p>west image of Hpa Kant, the economic outlet and opportunities </p><p>for local people have also declined significantly. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Most Kachin mining executives started as small time </p><p>prospectors, making their money as independent miners and </p><p>traders.  Now they have companies that, while capital-poor, </p><p>are able to offer experience and knowledge of the local </p><p>mining conditions.  Engineers and geologists are shunned in </p><p>the Kachin jade fields, while a nose for the rock is rewarded </p><p>handsomely.  The capital, and heavy equipment, necessary for </p><p>today\'s mining industry comes from three primary sources: (1) </p><p>Chinese investors from the PRC operating at arms length or </p><p>with illegally acquired Burmese ID papers; (2) the Burmese </p><p>military\'s Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd.; or, (3) </p><p>businesses from the Wa, Kokang, or Pa-O cease-fire groups who </p><p>have the cash to buy the heavy equipment, but not the </p><p>expertise to mine effectively. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) On the surface, the SPDC\'s Ministry of Mines </p><p>operates a rational bidding system.  Periodically, the </p><p>government auctions off surprisingly short 3-year leases on a </p><p>number of plots (of varying size) for prospecting and </p><p>development.  Bidders must put down a 100,000 kyat (about </p><p>$100) deposit for each bid, which is returned if the bid is </p><p>not successful.  The government establishes a minimum bid for </p><p>each plot (usually 1 million kyat ($1,000), but can be up to </p><p>55 million kyat ($55,000) for the best areas).  The bidding </p><p>process is far from transparent, as bidders are not allowed </p><p>to be present when the Ministry of Mines unseals the bids. </p><p>Not surprisingly, those with the best connections usually get </p><p>the best plots.  The Kachin miners say that partnering with </p><p>UMEHL ensures the best results during the bidding process, </p><p>but that the company is an unreliable partner that takes far </p><p>more than its share of the profits. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) In areas of the state that are under the </p><p>semi-autonomous control of the ethnic Kachin cease-fire </p><p>groups, the process is a bit different.  For plots not </p><p>specifically put up for bid by the SPDC, Kachin Independence </p><p>Organization (KIO) business representatives told us that they </p><p>are free to negotiate directly with private firms.  Non-KIO </p><p>Kachin jade miners and businessmen told us that dealing with </p><p>the KIO is often easier than negotiating with the SPDC </p><p>because the smaller bureaucracy means fewer bribes. </p><p> </p><p>Taking the Backdoor </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) There are two ways to get high-quality jade stones </p><p>onto the market.  The first, and more popular, route is to </p><p>hire couriers to illegally bring stones over the border </p><p>directly, or via Mandalay, to buyers in China or Thailand. </p><p>This bypasses the government\'s ostensibly rigid controls on </p><p>the sale of gems, and also the government\'s taxation system. </p><p>The second, legal, route is to pay an up front 20 percent tax </p><p>to the Ministry of Mines, bring the stones to Rangoon for </p><p>sale at the semi-annual gem emporium, and then pay taxes on </p><p>the profits (as well as various bribes along the way). </p><p>According to the miners, the only benefit of the second </p><p>route, besides its legality, is that foreign exchange profits </p><p>from these sales are "white" and thus can be used for </p><p>importing, etc. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Comment:  The restructuring of the jade mining </p><p>industry has brought about some positive short term </p><p>reductions in drugs and prostitution in mining towns. </p><p>However, these short term localized benefits are overshadowed </p><p>by increasingly serious economic and social ills across the </p><p>state.  Though NGOs can and do make a difference, until the </p><p>government and KIO focus on turning mining profits into </p><p>economic development, and creating economic alternatives for </p><p>local people, the humanitarian problems in Kachin State will </p><p>continue to expand.  End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
