<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 002323 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, T, PM, IO, DS; NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  12-18-12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, ECON, MV, KICC, UN, Maldives, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  During Mission visit, Maldivian MFA says it is </p><p>carefully reviewing proposed ICC Article 98 agreement </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 2180, and previous </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) State 250990 </p><p>-      (C) State 243173 </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 1926 (All Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of Mission. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF) SUMMARY:  During a December 17 meeting in </p><p>Male, Polchief urged the Maldivian government to sign an </p><p>ICC Article 98 agreement with the U.S.  MFA Permanent </p><p>Secretary Shaheed replied that the GoRM continued to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>review the proposal, which it viewed in a "favorable </p><p>light."  Shaheed made a strong pitch for a meeting </p><p>between Presidents Bush and Gayoom next year.  He </p><p>appreciated the information about Guantanamo access and </p><p>urged the U.S. to continue to support the Maldives\' </p><p>designation as a "developing country" at the UN.  In our </p><p>estimation, after repeated USG efforts, the Maldivians </p><p>seem to be inclining toward possibly concluding an </p><p>Article 98 agreement, but their review of the issue will </p><p>take time.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Proposed ICC Article 98 Agreement </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Polchief visited the Maldives, December 16-17. </p><p>During a December 17 meeting in Male, he discussed </p><p>several pressing bilateral issues with Dr. Ahmed </p><p>Shaheed, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs.  (Note:  See Septel re the Maldivian </p><p>domestic political situation, including the upcoming </p><p>presidential selection process.)  The first issue raised </p><p>in the meeting involved the U.S. proposal that the </p><p>Maldives sign an International Criminal Court (ICC) </p><p>Article 98 agreement.  As the Deputy Secretary, SA A/S </p><p>Rocca, and Mission have done repeatedly (see Ref A), </p><p>Polchief reiterated U.S. arguments urging the Maldives </p><p>to sign such an agreement as soon as possible.  Polchief </p><p>noted that Sri Lanka, a close friend of the Maldives, </p><p>had signed such an agreement on November 22.  The </p><p>Maldives would gain significant credit with the U.S. the </p><p>sooner it joined with us on this vital issue. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In response, Shaheed said the GoRM continued to </p><p>carefully review the proposal, which it viewed in a </p><p>"favorable light."  Additional Maldivian intra- </p><p>governmental study was necessary, however.  This review </p><p>would take at least several weeks.  One of the reasons </p><p>the review would take time was the fact that President </p><p>Gayoom had a busy travel schedule and would only be back </p><p>in Male in mid-January.  Polchief asked whether any </p><p>additional information re the U.S. proposal was needed. </p><p>Shaheed replied that the GoRM had enough information at </p><p>this point, and was just weighing whether the U.S. </p><p>proposal "conformed with Maldivian law" and was in the </p><p>country\'s "foreign policy interest."  (Note:  Ambassador </p><p>Wills plans to visit the Maldives in the January </p><p>timeframe and will take up the Article 98 issue with top </p><p>GoRM officials then, if it has not yet been settled.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Request for Meeting with President Bush </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Shifting focus, Shaheed noted President Gayoom\'s </p><p>strong interest in meeting with President Bush next year </p><p>(see Ref D).  Shaheed remarked that no GoRM leader had </p><p>ever had the privilege of meeting an American President </p><p>since the country obtained independence from Britain in </p><p>1965.  President Gayoom, who had been in office almost </p><p>25 years, would deeply appreciate the honor of even a </p><p>very short meeting.  The planned visit to the U.S. was a </p><p>part of a larger visit to Western Europe, and the GoRM </p><p>was confident that PM Blair and President Chirac would </p><p>meet with Gayoom.  Shaheed added that President Gayoom </p><p>was up for re-election next year and, as a politician, a </p><p>meeting with President Bush was especially important to </p><p>him at this time.  (Note:  Gayoom has been in power </p><p>since 1978.  Per the Maldives\' presidential selection </p><p>system, a popular referendum on the nominee of the </p><p>Parliament for the next five-year term in office is </p><p>scheduled to take place in mid-2003.  Per Septel, Gayoom </p><p>has not formally announced his candidacy, but he is </p><p>widely expected to run again.)  Polchief replied that </p><p>the U.S. is reviewing the Maldivian request, and will </p><p>get back to the GoRM at a later date.  Polchief also </p><p>provided Shaheed the original copy of the letter to </p><p>President Gayoom from President Bush, which was </p><p>contained in Ref C. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Guantanamo Access </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF) Per Ref B, Polchief reviewed with Shaheed the </p><p>information the GoRM has to provide the USG re the one- </p><p>to-three-person delegation it wants to send to </p><p>Guantanamo.  (Note:  The GoRM has requested access to </p><p>Ibrahim Fawzy, a prisoner held at Guantanamo who is a </p><p>Maldivian national.)  Shaheed said the government will </p><p>gather the information needed and provide it to the USG </p><p>as soon as possible.  He expected that the officials on </p><p>the proposed GoRM team would be from the National </p><p>Security Service (NSS).  (Note:  DATT met with the Chief </p><p>of the NSS last week and offered to escort to Guantanamo </p><p>any NSS officials the GoRM chooses to send there, should </p><p>the visit be approved.)  (Note:  In a separate meeting, </p><p>a NSS representative told Polchief that Fawzy is from </p><p>Baa Atoll located to the northwest of Male and had no </p><p>record of previous extremist behavior.  Fawzy went to </p><p>study in Pakistan some time back and the GoRM had lost </p><p>track of him there.  Mission is also faxing to SA/INS an </p><p>undated report that surfaced on the anti-GoRM website </p><p>"Sandhaanu" re the Fawzy matter.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>"Developing Country" Designation </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The final matter discussed at the meeting </p><p>concerned the Maldivian government\'s desire that it </p><p>continue to be designated a "LDC" (less developed </p><p>country) for purposes of the UN.  Shaheed said the issue </p><p>was due to be reviewed again in the UN Committee for </p><p>Development Policy (CDP) in April 2003.  Shaheed said </p><p>the GoRM would appreciate strong U.S. support on this </p><p>issue, as it had received in the past.  Polchief replied </p><p>that the U.S. wanted to be helpful, but was still </p><p>reviewing the issue.  Any additional information the </p><p>GoRM could provide re its position would be greatly </p><p>appreciated.  Shaheed said the MFA would send Mission a </p><p>detailed rationale of its stance soon.  (Note:  In a </p><p>meeting with Polchief, UN Resident Coordinator Minh Pham </p><p>related that he thought there was strong support at the </p><p>UN for the Maldives\' receiving another three-year </p><p>extension in LDC status.  He thought that some </p><p>countries\' would demand that the GoRM develop an "exit </p><p>strategy," however, given rising economic indicators.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C/NF) In our estimation, after repeated USG </p><p>efforts, the Maldivians seem to be inclining toward </p><p>possibly concluding an Article 98 agreement with the </p><p>U.S.  Their review of the issue will take time, however: </p><p>Gayoom is out of the country a great deal and things </p><p>just move slowly in the Maldives.  As we have emphasized </p><p>before, Mission recommends strongly a brief meeting for </p><p>Gayoom with President Bush next year, if at all </p><p>possible.  Relations between the U.S. and the Maldives, </p><p>a moderate Islamic country, have drawn closer since </p><p>September 11, 2001, and we think that even a brief </p><p>meeting would bring ties to another plane altogether. </p><p>Such a meeting would also help in terms of solidifying </p><p>Maldivian agreement to blanket overflight and ship </p><p>clearances, which might prove especially important </p><p>should there be a confrontation with Iraq (the Maldives </p><p>archipelago lies astride important Indian Ocean sea- </p><p>lanes and is located due north of Diego Garcia).  We </p><p>also recommend favorable consideration of the Maldives\' </p><p>request for continued "developing country" status at the </p><p>UN, which is an issue of the highest import to the </p><p>government.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
