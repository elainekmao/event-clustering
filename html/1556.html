BRUCE WHARTON FOR REASONS 1.5B AND D. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) IN ITS INTENSIFYING EFFORT TO CONTROL INFORMATION </p><p>AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC, THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO </p><p>HARDEN ITS APPROACH TOWARD THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) IS PURSUING A TWO-PRONGED </p><p>APPROACH: CAREFUL CONTROL OF THE CONTENT AND "SPIN" OF </p><p>NEWS REPORTED BY THE STATE-OWNED MEDIA; AND CONSTANT </p><p>CHALLENGES TO THE INDEPENDENT AND FOREIGN MEDIA\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO WORK.  BEHIND-THE-SCENES EFFORTS BY THE </p><p>STATE-OWNED AND THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA CONTINUE AS BOTH </p><p>SIDES JOCKEY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR POSITIONS.  THE GOZ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00897  01 OF 02  070830Z </p><p>CONTINUES TO PURSUE ITS AUTHORITARIAN INCLINATIONS WHILE </p><p>THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA CONTINUE TO SHOW COURAGE AND </p><p>TENACITY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>GOVERNMENT SYMPATHIZER ANNOUNCES NEW DAILY PAPER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THE WEEKLY "MIRROR" ANNOUNCED IN ITS FEBRUARY 23 </p><p>EDITION THAT IT WOULD LAUNCH "THE DAILY MIRROR" ON MAY </p><p>1.  "THE MIRROR" IS PUBLISHED BY PROFESSOR IBBO MANDAZA, </p><p>A ZIMBABWEAN POLITICAL SCIENTIST AND DIRECTOR OF THE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY SERIES (SAPES) TRUST, </p><p>A HARARE-BASED POLITICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTION.  THE </p><p>PUBLISHER IS PRACTICED IN THE ART OF DECEPTION. </p><p>ALTHOUGH MANDAZA DENIES THAT "THE MIRROR" SUPPORTS THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND ZANU-PF, EDITORIALS, THE WEEKLY ANONYMOUS </p><p>"SCRUTATOR" COLUMN (WRITTEN BY MANDAZA) AND EDITORIAL </p><p>DECISIONS LEAVE LITTLE DOUBT OF THE NEWSPAPER\'S </p><p>POLITICAL ORIENTATION.  "THE MIRROR\'S" TARGET AUDIENCE </p><p>IS EDUCATED, URBAN ZIMBABWEANS.  "THE MIRROR" CLAIMS </p><p>CIRCULATION OF ABOUT 20,000 PER WEEK (PROBABLY </p><p>OPTIMISTIC), AND CONTAINS VERY LITTLE ADVERTISING. </p><p>SINCE ITS LAUNCH IN EARLY 1999, ITS ABILITY TO SURVIVE </p><p>FINANCIALLY HAS BEEN SOMETHING OF A MYSTERY.  THE PAPER </p><p>INITIALLY RECEIVED SOME SUPPORT FROM THE SOUTHERN AFRICA </p><p>MEDIA DEVELOPMENT FUND (SAMDEF), BUT WAS TURNED DOWN IN </p><p>2000 FOR FUNDING FOR A DAILY PAPER.  SPECULATION IN </p><p>HARARE IS THAT "THE MIRROR\'S" OPERATING COSTS ARE </p><p>SUBSIDIZED BY SAPES REVENUES AND THROUGH FINANCIAL </p><p>SUPPORT FROM ZANU-PF.  IF "THE DAILY MIRROR" DOES APPEAR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00897  01 OF 02  070830Z </p><p>AS ADVERTISED ON MAY 1, IT WILL OFFER A MORE </p><p>SOPHISTICATED COUNTERPART TO THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED </p><p>DAILY "THE HERALD."  IT WILL ALSO BE SOMETHING OF A </p><p>FINANCIAL WONDER, THE ZIMBABWEAN MEDIA EQUIVALENT OF THE </p><p>MIRACLE OF THE LOAVES AND FISH. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>TIGHTENING ACCREDITATION OF FOREIGN JOURNALISTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE JOHANNESBURG-BASED REGIONAL CORRESPONDENT FOR </p><p>THE "WASHINGTON POST," JON JETER, TOLD US THAT HE </p><p>ENCOUNTERED A NEWLY CUMBERSOME PROCESS FOR GAINING A </p><p>PRESS CREDENTIAL IN ZIMBABWE.  SINCE JUNE 2000 THE </p><p>PROCESS HAS BEEN SIMPLE AND FAST, IF SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE. </p><p>IN THE PAST, FOREIGN JOURNALISTS SIMPLY HAD TO GO TO THE </p><p>INFORMATION MINISTRY, PRODUCE A PHOTO ID AND LETTER FROM </p><p>THEIR EMPLOYER, PAY (U.S.) $100 (IN US CURRENCY, </p><p>PLEASE), AND WERE ISSUED A WORK PERMIT ON THE SPOT. </p><p>THAT PERMIT WAS GOOD FOR UP TO 3 MONTHS.  UPON ARRIVAL </p><p>IN HARARE ON FEBRUARY 27, JETER FOUND A MORE COMPLICATED </p><p>PROCEDURE.  HE WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE DETAILS ABOUT THE </p><p>STORIES HE INTENDED TO FILE, THE PEOPLE HE WANTED TO </p><p>MEET, AND THE AREAS HE WISHED TO VISIT.  HIS PRO-FORMA </p><p>LETTER FROM THE "WASHINGTON POST" WAS ALSO QUESTIONED </p><p>AND HE WAS TOLD THAT FOR FUTURE VISITS HE NEEDED TO </p><p>PROVIDE A MORE SPECIFIC LETTER, ON OFFICIAL COMPANY </p><p>LETTERHEAD.  JETER WAS GIVEN A CREDENTIAL, BUT IT TOOK </p><p>24 HOURS INSTEAD OF THE HERETOFORE-USUAL 30 MINUTES. </p><p>JETER WAS ALSO TOLD BY AN OFFICIAL OF THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY THAT THE PROCESS WAS LIKELY TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HARARE  00897  01 OF 02  070830Z </p><p>BECOME MORE DIFFICULT WHEN NEW REGULATIONS GOVERNING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO6904 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00897  02 OF 02  070831Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   COR-01   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  USNW-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------CEA13E  071115Z /38 </p><p>R 021132Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8336 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000897 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D COPY - CLASSIFIED BY LINE ADDED </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S, AF/PD (COX, HOWARD, SANDERS) </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00897  02 OF 02  070831Z </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SA C.

JETER\'S EXPERIENCE AND THE WARNING OF </p><p>TOUGHER NEW ACCREDITATION PROCESSES ARE CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY MINISTER MOYO\'S STATEMENTS </p><p>AFTER THE FEBRUARY EXPULSION OF THE BBC AND "WEEKLY MAIL </p><p>AND GUARDIAN" CORRESPONDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>"DAILY NEWS" CLOSE TO ACQUIRING NEW PRINTING PRESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE "DAILY NEWS," WHICH HAS HEROICALLY PUBLISHED </p><p>AN EDITION EVERY DAY SINCE THE JANUARY BOMBING AND </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF ITS PRESSES, IS ON THE VERGE OF SIGNING A </p><p>CONTRACT FOR THE PURCHASE OF A NEW (U.S.)$4 MILLION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00897  02 OF 02  070831Z </p><p>PRINTING PRESS.  PRIVATE DONATIONS AND CORPORATE </p><p>FINANCIAL RESOURCES HAVE RAISED ABOUT ONE-HALF OF THE </p><p>PURCHASE PRICE.  THE BALANCE IS BEING PROVIDED VIA A </p><p>LOAN FROM THE SOROS FOUNDATION\'S MEDIA DEVELOPMENT ARM, </p><p>THE OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATION.  DELIVERY AND SET-UP OF THE </p><p>PRESS WILL TAKE ABOUT 6 MONTHS FROM THE TIME THE </p><p>CONTRACT IS SIGNED.  IMPORTATION OF THE PRESS MAY BE A </p><p>CHALLENGE IF THERE IS ANY SUBSTANCE BEHIND MINISTER </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO\'S THREATS TO BAN FOREIGN DONATIONS TO THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN BUSINESSMEN SHORE UP INDEPENDENT MEDIA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ZIMBABWE\'S TWO MOST SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS, </p><p>STRIVE MASIYIWA (ECONET WIRELESS) AND NIGEL CHANAKIRA </p><p>(KINGDOM FINANCIAL HOLDINGS) HAVE MADE MAJOR INVESTMENTS </p><p>IN THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA.  THE TWO HAVE CREATED A </p><p>HOLDING COMPANY, THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA GROUP (IMG) THAT </p><p>HAS BOUGHT CONTROLLING SHARES IN ASSOCIATED NEWSPAPERS </p><p>OF ZIMBABWE (ANZ), THE PARENT COMPANY OF THE "DAILY </p><p>NEWS."  IMG HAS ALSO BOUGHT LARGE, THOUGH NOT </p><p>CONTROLLING AMOUNTS, OF STOCK IN THE "ZIMBABWE </p><p>INDEPENDENT" AND THE "STANDARD."  THESE ARE IMPORTANT </p><p>INVESTMENTS AS THEY PROVIDE A MUCH-NEEDED FINANCIAL </p><p>CUSHION TO ALL THREE PAPERS AND BRING THEM INTO THE </p><p>ORBIT OF ZIMBABWE\'S MOST TALENTED AND SUCCESSFUL </p><p>BUSINESSMEN.  (NB: BOTH MASIYIWA AND CHANAKIRA WERE </p><p>THREATENED BY GOZ-ENGINEERED LAWSUITS IN 2000 WHEN IT </p><p>BECAME APPARENT THAT NEITHER OF THE MEN SUPPORTED ZANU- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00897  02 OF 02  070831Z </p><p>PF.
