<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 RANGOON 000309 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, G/TIP, G, INL, DRL, IWI, AND EAP/RSP </p><p>PACOM FOR FPA </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, ELAB, KCRM, KFRD, KWMN, PHUM, PREF, PREL, SMIG, BM, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA: THIRD ANNUAL TIP REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 22225 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The following report responds to the checklist </p><p>provided in reftel requesting information on trafficking in </p><p>persons activities in Burma.  The report will also be </p><p>forwarded to EAP/BCLTV in Word format. </p><p> </p><p>Begin Report: </p><p> </p><p>Overview of Country\'s Activities - </p><p> </p><p>A. Burma is a country of origin for international trafficking </p><p>of men, women, and children, primarily for sexual </p><p>exploitation but also for labor exploitation.  Internal </p><p>trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labor also </p><p>occurs throughout the country.  There are no reliable </p><p>estimates of the magnitude of the international or internal </p><p>trafficking.  The government does not effectively collect </p><p>such information and, due to strict government controls over </p><p>information flow, there are no independent assessments of the </p><p>problem.  The government estimates that only 46 women were </p><p>trafficked to Thailand in 2002, for instance, while other </p><p>sources generally estimate that there are thousands of </p><p>trafficking victims to Thailand each year.  Sources for </p><p>information on trafficking include government affiliated </p><p>non-governmental organizations, international </p><p>non-governmental organizations, UN offices in Burma, and </p><p>international non-governmental organizations in Thailand. </p><p>Women and girls are the primary international trafficking and </p><p>internal sex trafficking victims while internal forced labor </p><p>trafficking appears to include victims of all ages and both </p><p>sexes. </p><p> </p><p>B.  Internationally, Burmese men, women, and children are </p><p>trafficked primarily to Thailand but also reportedly to </p><p>China, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Malaysia and Japan. </p><p>Internally, sex trafficking of women and girls occurs from </p><p>villages throughout the country to urban centers and to other </p><p>centers for prostitution such as trucking crossroads, fishing </p><p>villages, border towns, and mining and military camps. </p><p> </p><p>C.  There has been no discernible change in the direction or </p><p>extent of trafficking in recent years, although, as </p><p>mentioned, there is no effective monitoring of the problem. </p><p> </p><p>D.  The Myanmar National Working Committee on Women\'s Affairs </p><p>(MNCWA), a self-sustaining (does not receive government </p><p>funding) government organization, in conjunction with the UN </p><p>Interagency Project on Trafficking in the Sub-Mekong Region </p><p>(UN-IAP) plans to collect data on trafficking in selected </p><p>townships this year.  The results of this survey are not </p><p>available for this year\'s report.  On the extent of forced </p><p>labor in the country, the International Labor Office believes </p><p>that it still occurs wherever the military has a presence, </p><p>but there is no accurate estimate of the number of victims </p><p>per year. </p><p> </p><p>E.  Burma is not a destination country for trafficking in </p><p>persons. </p><p> </p><p>F.  Poverty is the driving force behind trafficking in </p><p>persons for sex and exploitative labor practices in Burma. </p><p>Victims are either attempting to make a better living for </p><p>themselves or, more commonly, attempting to make money to </p><p>provide a better standard of living to their family.  Young </p><p>girls in families are the most common targets.  The </p><p>traffickers at the village level are often older women who </p><p>provide "a connection" for the local girls.  Once out of the </p><p>village the girls may pass through several brokers before </p><p>they end up in a brothel in another part of Burma or in a </p><p>foreign country (most frequently Thailand).  Victims are </p><p>generally trafficked by the cheapest means available, in the </p><p>back of trucks or in buses.  Because of tight controls over </p><p>travel near border areas, victims would typically require </p><p>false documentation or bribes to make it through military, </p><p>immigration, and customs check-points, or through the many </p><p>"unofficial" border crossings controlled by cease-fire and </p><p>anti-government groups. </p><p> </p><p>G.  During the year, the government has greatly increased its </p><p>commitment to combating sex trafficking, focusing on media </p><p>awareness campaigns and the arrest and prosecution of </p><p>traffickers.  On the issue of forced labor, however, the </p><p>government has continued to do the minimal necessary to avoid </p><p>the implementation of sanctions by ILO member organizations. </p><p>A particularly sensitive aspect of the military\'s continuing </p><p>use of forced labor is the use of forcibly conscripted child </p><p>soldiers, a practice that has been highlighted in the press, </p><p>which continues but is difficult to quantify, and which the </p><p>government denies.  There have been no prosecutions to our </p><p>knowledge of government officials linked to TIP or against </p><p>Army personnel involved in forced labor.  It is very </p><p>difficult to identify any funding specifically allocated for </p><p>TIP.  The government generally tasks groups to achieve policy </p><p>initiatives without providing sufficient funding.  For </p><p>instance, the most active government organization on sexual </p><p>trafficking, the MNCWA, is "self-sustaining," meaning it </p><p>depends on donations and volunteers to implement its </p><p>programs. </p><p> </p><p>H.  Yes, there is undoubtedly some complicity of government </p><p>officials in sexual trafficking, although it is probably </p><p>limited to local or regional officials attempting to </p><p>supplement meager salaries by turning a blind eye to </p><p>trafficking activities.  There are some reports that Military </p><p>Intelligence (the internal intelligence service) controls </p><p>some brothels and, by extension, would be involved in </p><p>trafficking.  We do not have reliable information on the </p><p>extent to which this is happening.  Military officials and </p><p>township officials are directly involved in trafficking for </p><p>forced labor inside the country.  This practice remains </p><p>common throughout the country, but is worst in the border </p><p>areas.  We are aware of no prosecutions of government </p><p>officials for either sex or forced labor trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>I.  The government\'s ability to address sex trafficking is </p><p>limited by the lack of funding allocated for social programs. </p><p> Burma is among the lowest ranked countries in the world for </p><p>per capita expenditures on health and education services, for </p><p>instance.  The government over the past 14 years has </p><p>drastically cut funding for social services in order to fund </p><p>military priorities.  This trend continues still. Also, </p><p>because of the government\'s serious economic mismanagement, </p><p>poverty and widespread corruption have become the norm. </p><p>Economic desperation is continually cited as the root cause </p><p>of sex trafficking in the country; people do things they </p><p>would not have considered if they had better economic </p><p>opportunities. </p><p> </p><p>Prevention: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Yes, the government this year has begun to acknowledge </p><p>that sex trafficking is a serious problem.  However, the </p><p>government has not publicly acknowledged, especially inside </p><p>the country, that forced labor continues to be a serious </p><p>problem. </p><p> </p><p>B.  The Ministry of Home Affairs is the lead agency in </p><p>anti-trafficking actions for sexual trafficking with support </p><p>from the Ministries of Social Welfare, Immigration, and </p><p>Labor, the Supreme Court, and the Attorney General.  The </p><p>Labor Ministry is the lead agency on forced labor. </p><p> </p><p>C.  Yes, the MNCWA has conducted seminars, produced and shown </p><p>videotapes on television, and developed radio programs </p><p>highlighting the perils of trafficking.  On forced labor, the </p><p>government has posted in public places directives issued in </p><p>1999 and 2000 prohibiting the use of forced labor.  There has </p><p>been no assessment of the effectiveness of the sexual </p><p>trafficking awareness campaign.  Forced labor appears to be </p><p>continuing unabated in spite of the posting of the directives </p><p>against it. </p><p>D.  Although the MNCWA and other social services </p><p>organizations have programs to provide women with income </p><p>generating skills and to encourage women to take a greater </p><p>role in the community, these programs are dwarfed by the </p><p>desperate conditions of most women in the country.  Given the </p><p>government\'s absence of funding for these programs (they are </p><p>largely "self-sustaining"), they reach only a small </p><p>percentage of the women in need. </p><p> </p><p>E.  Prevention has been the focus of the government\'s efforts </p><p>this year, with public awareness campaigns, workshops, and </p><p>township "talks."  There is no specific budget for these </p><p>activities, however, they are just included in the policy </p><p>programming of relevant Ministries and organizations within </p><p>existing resources. </p><p> </p><p>F.  The government attempts to control "civil society" and </p><p>ensure that all citizens support the policies of the regime. </p><p>Local township organizations are extensions of the military </p><p>junta and use a combination of a spoils system and </p><p>intimidation to ensure support for government policies.  As a </p><p>result, the citizenry generally attempts to minimize its </p><p>contacts with these organizations.  On the issue of </p><p>trafficking, citizens are encouraged to attend workshops and </p><p>talks in order to show support for the government policies. </p><p>Because these government programs are self-sustaining, </p><p>citizens are, at least in some cases, also required to make </p><p>cash "donations" to support the programs. </p><p> </p><p>G.  The borders with neighboring countries are porous.  While </p><p>the government controls numerous official border crossings, </p><p>there are probably hundreds of other crossings under the </p><p>control of cease-fire groups, anti-government groups, and </p><p>smugglers.  We are not aware of any monitoring of immigration </p><p>or emigration patterns, or the analysis of this data for </p><p>patterns of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>H.  Yes, there is a multi-agency task force under the </p><p>guidance of the Home Ministry to address sexual trafficking </p><p>in persons and a Convention 29 Implementation Committee under </p><p>the Ministry of Labor to address forced labor.  (See </p><p>Prevention - B.)  There is no public corruption task force. </p><p> </p><p>I.  The MNCWA participates in regional and world conferences </p><p>on women\'s issues, including trafficking.  However, there has </p><p>not been any regional coordination on specific interventions </p><p>to prevent, monitor, or control sex trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>J.  Yes, there is a national plan to address sexual </p><p>trafficking in persons, which has been disseminated by hand. </p><p>The MNCWA developed the plan in coordination with the </p><p>relevant ministries including Social Welfare, Immigration, </p><p>and Home Affairs.  The plan was not coordinated with </p><p>international NGO\'s working on TIP.  There is no national </p><p>plan to address the issue of forced labor. </p><p> </p><p>K.  The Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, Brigadier General </p><p>Thura Myint Maung, is the Chairman of the Human Trafficking </p><p>Prevention Work Committee.  The Minister of Labor is the </p><p>person responsible for addressing forced labor. </p><p> </p><p>Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers: </p><p> </p><p>A.  No, there is no law specifically prohibiting trafficking </p><p>in persons.  As was the case last year, the laws used to </p><p>prosecute human traffickers are a combination of laws against </p><p>kidnapping and prostitution.  The government is considering </p><p>whether to adopt new legislation specifically addressing </p><p>trafficking in persons but a decision is still pending.  The </p><p>Attorney General\'s office said it believes existing laws are </p><p>adequate to prosecute traffickers while the Ministry of Home </p><p>Affairs stated a new law may be necessary. </p><p>B.  Sentences for trafficking in persons have ranged from </p><p>five to twelve years, with most cases carrying a sentence of </p><p>seven years imprisonment. </p><p>C.  Penalties for prostitution are up to ten years </p><p>imprisonment, sexual assault of an adult is up to two years, </p><p>and sexual assault of a minor is up to ten years. </p><p> </p><p>D.  The government states that it has prosecuted 93 cases </p><p>against human traffickers.  It states that it has arrested </p><p>160 trafficking brokers.  It has provided the Embassy and </p><p>G/TIP with extracts of 30 of the prosecutions.  Some of these </p><p>prosecutions appear to be against traffickers while others </p><p>appear to be against migrant smugglers.  There have been no </p><p>prosecutions relating to forced labor. </p><p> </p><p>E.  Human trafficking for sexual exploitation appears to be </p><p>primarily small-scale operations using village contacts that </p><p>feed into more established trafficking "brokers."  There is </p><p>no evidence of travel or tourism agencies being involved in </p><p>the trafficking.  We have no information on where profits </p><p>from this kind of trafficking end up.  Human trafficking </p><p>relating to forced labor is directed by the military and </p><p>supported by township officials who arrange to meet the </p><p>military\'s requirements. </p><p> </p><p>F.  The prosecutions of traffickers that we have reviewed </p><p>indicate that most arrests occur as the result of "tip-offs" </p><p>to local police rather than investigations.  While the </p><p>government maintains extensive and intrusive controls over </p><p>the population, trafficking in humans is not the target of </p><p>these efforts. </p><p> </p><p>G.  The government does not provide this specialized training </p><p>but the UN-IAP has conducted workshops that touch on this </p><p>aspect of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>H.  No, there is no evidence that the government is </p><p>cooperating with other governments on the investigation and </p><p>prosecution of trafficking cases.  When G/TIP and Emboff </p><p>recommended greater cooperation with Thailand on this issue, </p><p>government officials were non-committal. </p><p> </p><p>I.  No, there have been no extraditions of human traffickers </p><p>to other countries.  Burmese law prevents the extradition of </p><p>nationals except under exceptional circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>J/K.  Given the pervasive government control that exists over </p><p>the activities of all citizens, there has to be some </p><p>tolerance and/or collusion of government officials in sexual </p><p>human trafficking in order for the practice to continue on a </p><p>large scale.  The National Committee Against Human </p><p>Trafficking told G/TIP and Emboff, however, that there have </p><p>been no arrests or prosecutions of government officials </p><p>involved in trafficking.  On forced labor, the military is </p><p>the driving force behind the practice, and there have been no </p><p>related arrests or prosecutions. </p><p> </p><p>L.  No, the government has not signed any of these </p><p>international instruments. </p><p> </p><p>Protection and Assistance to Victims </p><p> </p><p>A.  The MNCWA and the Ministry of Social Welfare assist </p><p>returning trafficking victims.  The assistance largely </p><p>consists of counseling and job training at care centers </p><p>before the women are returned to their families.  The MNCWA </p><p>states that in 2002 a total of 15 victims were counseled at </p><p>these facilities before being returned to their families, </p><p>while 122 victims were transferred directly back to their </p><p>families. </p><p> </p><p>B.  No, the government does not provide funding to foreign or </p><p>domestic NGOs for services to victims.  Foreign NGOs have </p><p>provided some services and support to the government and </p><p>local NGOs beginning this year.  For the first time, </p><p>international NGOs have coordinated a limited number of </p><p>victim repatriations with the government and local NGOs and </p><p>provided public awareness materials to the government </p><p>(pamphlets to the Ministry of Home Affairs at its request). </p><p> </p><p>C.  There appears to be a growing understanding of the need </p><p>to protect victims, especially those returning from </p><p>international trafficking.  We have heard of no returning </p><p>victims being arrested or jailed. </p><p> </p><p>D.  There has not been much focus on this aspect of sexual </p><p>human trafficking in public awareness campaigns to date and </p><p>we know of no case in which the victims have filed suit </p><p>against traffickers.  In the area of forced labor, victims do </p><p>not have an adequate mechanism for lodging complaints or </p><p>seeking prosecutions. </p><p> </p><p>E.  We do not have any information on the level of protection </p><p>the government can or does provide witnesses in trafficking </p><p>cases. </p><p> </p><p>F.  The UN-IAP has established an excellent workshop for </p><p>government officials on the recognition and provision of </p><p>assistance to victims of sexual human trafficking.  The </p><p>workshops are intended to be self-sustaining, with government </p><p>officials becoming the workshop trainers.  The workshops </p><p>appear to be very effective and are being offered to an </p><p>ever-expanding number of officials who interface with the </p><p>trafficking issue (police, social workers, immigration </p><p>officials, etc.).  The training has not been provided to </p><p>Burmese Embassy staff in other countries and we have no </p><p>information that these staff have instructions on engaging </p><p>with NGOs working with trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p>G/H. See "A" and "B" above; also "Overview - I." </p><p> </p><p>End Report. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  The Embassy point of contact on TIP is Poloff John </p><p>Haynes, tel. 95-1-256-020, fax 95-1-256-018, e-mail </p><p>haynesjd@state.gov.
