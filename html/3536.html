<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 004697 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/20/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETRD, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR WORRIED ABOUT BANKS\' </p><p>EXPOSURE TO OIL FOR FOOD TRADE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Summary.  Jordan\'s central bank governor is worried </p><p>that a sudden interruption in Oil for Food exports via Jordan </p><p>to Iraq in the event of military action in Iraq could leave </p><p>the Jordanian banking system seriously exposed.  He requested </p><p>U.S. views on possible mechanisms that would help banks cope </p><p>with this problem.  Jordanian ministries are working on an </p><p>assessment of the likely economic fallout of a disruption in </p><p>trade with Iraq, which, the governor expects, would be </p><p>difficult, but manageable at a high cost.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Central Bank Governor Umayya Touqan told econ chief </p><p>August 19 that an inter-ministerial group led by the finance </p><p>ministry at the behest of the Prime Minister is working on </p><p>economic planning for managing the fallout on Jordan of a </p><p>possible military strike on Iraq.  He said the group was </p><p>preparing a short paper, which should be forwarded to the </p><p>U.S. and other governments soon. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  One area of specific concern to the Central Bank </p><p>that Touqan said he had discussed with the Prime Minister </p><p>(who had also raised it with the Ambassador) is the exposure </p><p>of Jordanian commercial banks to UN Oil for Food program </p><p>exports to Iraq.  At any one time, Touqan said, Jordanian </p><p>banks have USD 400-500 million in letters of credit </p><p>outstanding to finance this trade.  Under current procedures, </p><p>UN officials in Baghdad confirm receipt of goods in Iraq </p><p>before BNP as the bank managing the oil for food account </p><p>releases payment for OFF contracts to Jordanian banks.  If </p><p>this system were unable to function because of military </p><p>activity, Jordanian banks could be left holding the bag. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Touqan said that the USD 400-500 million estimated </p><p>in outstanding Jordanian bank credit is concentrated in and </p><p>makes up a substantial part of the assets of 4-5 Jordanian </p><p>commercial banks.  He did not think these banks, or by </p><p>extension the banking system as a whole could absorb the </p><p>shock of having so much liquidity tied up in the event of an </p><p>extended conflict. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Two possible mechanisms for dealing with this had </p><p>occurred to Jordanian officials:  1)  UN inspectors could be </p><p>stationed at the Jordan-Iraq border to take control of </p><p>incoming goods.  In this case, banks could be paid and goods </p><p>could be held at the border until delivered to their ultimate </p><p>destination.  2) Alternatively, goods could be stored in </p><p>Jordan with the Jordanian banks keeping or acquiring title to </p><p>them.  This would allow the banks to use the goods as </p><p>security in order to raise funds.  Touqan said that there </p><p>were no doubt other ways to deal with this problem and would </p><p>appreciate the U.S. government\'s opinion. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Overall, Touqan described the impact on Jordan of a </p><p>disruption in its trade with Iraq as difficult, but </p><p>ultimately manageable.  He said the central bank would act </p><p>aggressively by raising interest rates to counter any </p><p>inflationary tendencies arising from a likely increase in the </p><p>government deficit.  This would result from the expected loss </p><p>of the Iraq oil grant, a drop in tax revenue due to a </p><p>contraction in economic activity, and increased emergency </p><p>spending to help companies and individuals cope in such a </p><p>crisis.  At the same time, remittances, export earnings, and </p><p>tourism receipts would drop sharply.  Jordan would use its </p><p>resources, including its foreign reserves, but obviously, </p><p>Touqan said, the more quickly military action was over, the </p><p>easier it would be for Jordan to absorb such a massive shock. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S)  Comment:  Touqan, an economist and former diplomat, </p><p>is not prone to dramatization; but the scenario he paints </p><p>sounds like a recipe for shutting down the financial system </p><p>for possibly an extended period.  We would appreciate being </p><p>able to convey to him and to the Prime Minister Washington\'s </p><p>views on the issue Touqan raises. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
