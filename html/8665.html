<p>UNCLAS ROME 002646 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IT, IS, KPAL, IZ, EU </p><p>SUBJECT: FM FRATTINI ON THE MEPP, IRAQ, AND TRANSATLANTIC </p><p>RELATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: ON JUNE 11, FM FRATTINI GAVE A SPEECH ENTITLED </p><p>"NEW SCENARIOS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE PERSIAN GULF, AND </p><p>TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS" AT THE CENTER FOR DEFENSE STUDIES IN </p><p>ROME.  HE URGED THE ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS TO SEIZE </p><p>THE MOMENTUM OF THE AQABA SUMMIT, STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>    REVIVING THE PALESTINIAN ECONOMY, AND SPOKE OF THE LONG-TERM </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF ISRAEL JOINING THE EU.  HE PRAISED THE WORK OF </p><p>THE ITALIAN MOD AND MFA IN IRAQ DURING AND AFTER THE MILITARY </p><p>INTERVENTION.  HE ALSO INVITED THE EU TO RAISE DEFENSE </p><p>SPENDING AND COOPERATE WELL WITH THE US TO SOLVE OUR COMMON </p><p>PROBLEMS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>-------- </p><p>THE MEPP </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>2. FRATTINI SAID THAT THE MEPP WILL BE ONE OF ITALY\'S HIGHEST </p><p>PRIORITIES DURING ITS EU PRESIDENCY (SECOND HALF OF 2003). </p><p>PM BERLUSCONI\'S DEEP PERSONAL INTEREST IN ADVANCING THE MEPP </p><p>IS DERIVED NOT ONLY FROM THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CAUSE BUT IS </p><p>ALSO THE PRODUCT OF PRESIDENT BUSH\'S PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO </p><p>HIS TWO-STATE VISION AND THE STRONG PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL </p><p>TIES BETWEEN BERLUSCONI AND BUSH, SAID FRATTINI.  THE SHARM </p><p>EL SHEIKH AND AQABA SUMMITS CREATED A "WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY" </p><p>THAT MUST BE SEIZED IMMEDIATELY, SAID FRATTINI.  PM SHARON </p><p>MUST CONTINUE DISMANTLING THE ILLEGAL SETTLEMENTS, PM ABBAS </p><p>MUST SPARE NO EFFORT TO END TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE.  FRATTINI </p><p>PRAISED THE PRESIDENT\'S DECISION TO SEND THE FIRST GROUP OF </p><p>AMERICAN OBSERVERS TO THE REGION, SAYING THAT THE ROADMAP </p><p>CANNOT BE CARRIED OUT UNLESS THERE WAS A MONITORING MECHANISM </p><p>ON THE GROUND.  HE ADDED THAT ITALY, WITH A DEMONSTRATED </p><p>EXPERTISE IN MONITORING WORK, STANDS READY TO ASSIST IF </p><p>CALLED UPON BY THE US.  FRATTINI ALSO INVITED THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT PALESTINIAN POLICE </p><p>FORCES HAVE THE MEANS NECESSARY TO FIGHT TERRORIST GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE MARSHALL PLAN: NO DURABLE PEACE IN THE REGION CAN </p><p>    HAPPEN AS LONG AS THE CURRENT ECONOMIC GAP BETWEEN ISRAELIS </p><p>(AVERAGE PER CAPITA INCOME OF $18,000 PER YEAR) AND THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS (AVERAGE PER CAPITA INCOME OF $1,400 PER YEAR) </p><p>PERSISTS, ARGUED FRATTINI.  THAT IS WHY PM BERLUSCONI CAME UP </p><p>WITH THE IDEA OF A "MARSHALL PLAN" TO HELP REBUILD THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN ECONOMY.  AT THE EVIAN SUMMIT, THE G8 DECIDED TO </p><p>STUDY SPECIFIC TERMS FOR HELPING THE PALESTINIAN ECONOMY. </p><p>"TERRORISM CAN NEVER BE JUSTIFIED; BUT IT DOES HAVE REASONS, </p><p>AND ECONOMIC DESPERATION IS ONE OF THEM," SAID FRATTINI. </p><p> </p><p>4. ISRAEL AS FUTURE MEMBER OF THE EU: WHEN ASKED TO COMMENT </p><p>ON BERLUSCONI\'S STATEMENT IN JERUSALEM ON JUNE 9 THAT ISRAEL </p><p>SHOULD JOIN THE EU, FRATTINI SAID THAT BERLUSCONI\'S STATEMENT </p><p>WAS MORE THAN A POLITICAL ONE.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>WAS TRYING TO HELP PALESTINE UNDERGO THE INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REFORMS NEEDED TO BECOME A DEMOCRACY, SO WHY NOT OFFER THE </p><p>ONLY REAL DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ISRAEL, WHICH SHARES </p><p>MANY VALUES WITH THE WESTERN WORLD, THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>JOINING THE EU, ASKED RHETORICALLY FRATTINI.  HE THEN SAID </p><p>THAT THIS WOULD BE A LONG-TERM PLAN. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>5. FRATTINI PRAISED THE GOI\'S ROLE DURING AND AFTER THE IRAQ </p><p>MILITARY INTERVENTION.  "ITALY WAS NOT NEUTRAL IN THE </p><p>CONFLICT, AND WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO SEND HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE AND STABILIZATION FORCES TO IRAQ AFTER THE </p><p>MILITARY INTERVENTION.  ITALY WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE POLITICALLY </p><p>AND MORALLY TO THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF IRAQ," SAID FRATTINI. </p><p>    HE PRAISED THE "EXEMPLARY COORDINATION" BETWEEN THE ITALIAN </p><p>MOD AND MFA WHICH HAS ENABLED, FOR INSTANCE, THE DEPLOYMENT </p><p>OF AN ITALIAN FIELD HOSPITAL IN BAGHDAD WHICH HAS TREATED </p><p>4,300 PATIENTS IN ITS FIRST MONTH ON THE GROUND. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. FRATTINI SAID THAT ITALY HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE </p><p>EXCELLENT RELATIONS WITH BOTH THE US AND THE EU.  HAVING </p><p>COMMON VALUES WITH THE US IS NOT ENOUGH THOUGH, SAID </p><p>FRATTINI, WHO INVITED THE EUROPEANS TO TAKE COMMON ACTIONS </p><p>WITH THE US IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM, THE SPREAD OF </p><p>WMD, AND IN THE MEPP.  HE ALSO CALLED ON THE EU TO INCREASE </p><p>ITS DEFENSE SPENDING TO BECOME "PRODUCERS OF SECURITY" AND </p><p>NOT JUST "CONSUMERS OF SECURITY" AND TO LOWER ITS DEPENDENCE </p><p>ON THE US.  "WE (AMERICANS AND EUROPEANS) WILL REACH OUR </p><p>COMMON GOALS BETTER WHEN WE ARE BOTH STRONG AND COOPERATE </p><p>WELL TOGETHER," SAID FRATTINI. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME02646 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
