ATTORNEY ESSA MOOSA WHO SPOKE WITH HIM LAST WEEK, </p><p>SAYS MANDELA FULLY EXPECTS THAT ON FEBRUARY 2 DE KLERK </p><p>WILL ANNOUNCE THE UNBANNING OF THE ANC, PAC AND OTHER </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, </p><p>THE RETURN OF POLITICAL EXILES TO SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        CAPE T  00097  01 OF 03  182017Z </p><p> </p><p>RELEASE OF SEVERAL POLITICAL PRISONERS INCLUDING MANDELA </p><p>HIMSELF.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WOULD COME </p><p>SWIFTLY AFTER DE KLERK\'S SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  THE SAG IS CONCERNED OVER ANC RELATIONS WITH THE SACP </p><p>AND OVER THE WORKING DEFINITION OF "ONE MAN ONE VOTE," </p><p>AMONG OTHER "WHITE FEARS" ISSUES.  MANDELA HAS PASSED </p><p>DE KLERK\'S "PROPOSALS" ON THESE TOPICS TO THE ANC. </p><p>THE ORGANIZATION\'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT IS WILLING TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE EVEN WHILE APARTHEID LAWS REMAIN IN PLACE MAY </p><p>BE PART OF THE ANC\'S REPLY TO THE SAG. </p><p> </p><p>4.  TENSIONS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>REDUCED BY THE SAG\'S TACTIC OF OPENING DIALOGUE AND A </p><p>COMMITMENT SHARED BY THE MDM TO REDUCE CONFRONTATIONS. </p><p>WHILE MAINLY OF BENEFIT TO THE SAG, THIS PERIOD OF CALM </p><p>COULD ALSO FAVOR THE ANC\'S NEW STRATEGY OF PRAGMATISM. </p><p> </p><p>5.  RAISING THE PENDING VISIT OF JESSE JACKSON, MOOSA </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT IT WOULD BE BAD FOR THE STRUGGLE </p><p>IF JACKSON ADVOCATED LIFTING SANCTIONS UPON HIS RETURN TO </p><p>THE US.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>- </p><p>6.  IN A HALF HOUR CONVERSATION WITH POLECONOFF. ESSA </p><p>MOOSA. THE WESTERN CAPE UDF\'S LAWYER AND ONE OF THE </p><p>ATTORNEYS WHO MET WITH MANDELA LAST WEEK, MADE THE F0LLOW- </p><p>ING REMARKS: </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>MANDELA RELEASE WILL BE ANNOUNCED FEBRUARY 2 IN PARLIAMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>7.  MANDELA MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT HE FULLY EXPECTS </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        CAPE T  00097  01 OF 03  182017Z </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT FW DE KLERK TO MAKE SEVERAL MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS </p><p>IN HIS FEBRUARY 2 SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT. </p><p>DE KLERK WILL ANNOUNCE: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE UNBANNING OF THE ANC, PAC AND OTHER POLITICAL </p><p>-  ORGANIZATIONS; </p><p> </p><p>-- THE END OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY; </p><p> </p><p>-- THE RETURN OF POLITICAL EXILES TO SOUTH AFRICA; </p><p> </p><p>-- THE RELEASE OF A NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS, </p><p>-  INCLUDING NELSON MANDELA. </p><p>- </p><p>8.  THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT ALL </p><p>THE ITEMS LISTED WILL TAKE EFFECT AS OF THE TIME OF THE </p><p>SPEECH.  BUT FIRM PLANS AND A COMMITMENT TO CARRY THEM OUT </p><p>SWIFTLY WILL BE PART OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>WHERE WILL MANDELA BE RELEASED? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>9.  MOOSA SIDESTEPPED A QUESTION ABOUT WHERE MANDELA\'S </p><p>HOME BASE WOULD BE UPON HIS RELEASE.  HE ONLY REMARKED </p><p>THAT MANDELA CAN TELL THE SAG WHERE HE WANTS TO BE </p><p>RELEASED AND WHERE HIS FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE WOULD THUS </p><p>TAKE PLACE.  SENTIMENTALLY, SAID MOOSA, PAARL (WHERE </p><p>MANDELA IS NOW IN PRISON) SEEMED TO APPEAL TO MANDELA. </p><p>(COMMENT:  BUT POLITICALLY AND PRACTICALLY THIS MAKES </p><p>LITTLE SENSE.  JOHANNESBURG SEEMS BY FAR THE MOST </p><p>SUITABLE VENUE. END COMMENT.) </p><p>- </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>R 171512Z JAN 90 </p><p>FM AMCONSUL CAPE TOWN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5366 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMCONSUL JOHANNESBURG </p><p>AMCONSUL DURBAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 CAPE TOWN 00097 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR KOLKER, PARIS FOR FENDRICK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM. SF </p><p>SUBJECT:  ESSA MOOSA TALKS ABOUT MANDELA AND OTHER TOPICS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>DE KLERK-ANC COMMUNICATION THROUGH MANDELA </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  WHEN HE MET SEVERAL WEEKS AGO WITH MANDELA, DE KLERK </p><p>PROVIDED A SET OF PROPOSALS AND ASKED FOR THE ANC\'S </p><p>RESPONSE.  MANDELA HAS NOT DISCUSSED THOSE PROPOSALS </p><p>IN ANY DETAIL WITH PEOPLE HERE (AT LEAST HE DID NOT DO SO </p><p>WITH THE LAWYERS\' GROUP OF WHICH MOOSA WAS A MEMBER) BUT </p><p>HE DID TRANSMIT THEM TO ALFRED NZO AND THABO MBEKI. </p><p>MOOSA BELIEVES (PIECING TOGETHER STRAY REMARKS WHERE AND </p><p>THERE) THAT THE PROPOSALS RELATED PRINCIPALLY TO THE NEED </p><p>TO ALLAY WHITE FEARS.  SPECIFICALLY, HE THINKS ONE ISSUE </p><p>WAS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE ANC TO THE SACP (SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY) AND ANOTHER WAS THE DEFINITION OF ONE MAN </p><p>ONE VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  ASIDE FROM BEING AN EFFORT TO SEIZE THE MORAL HIGH </p><p>GROUND BY PUBLICLY DEMONSTRATING FLEXIBILITY, THE ANC\'S </p><p>RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT IS PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE </p><p>EVEN WHILE APARTHEID LAWS LIKE THE GROUP AREAS ACT REMAIN </p><p>IN PLACE MAY BE PART OF THE ORGANIZATION\'S REPLY TO DE </p><p>KLERK. </p><p> </p><p>12.  MOOSA UNDERSTANDS MANDELA TO HAVE WORKED OUT A </p><p>GAME PLAN FOR "NEXT STEPS" IN A NEGOTIATION WITH DE KLERK </p><p>SO AS TO ENSURE THAT HE IS NOT RELEASED FROM PRISON </p><p>INTO A VACUUM. </p><p> </p><p>13.  MANDELA HAS TOLD VARIOUS VISITORS THAT HE HAS A GOOD </p><p>OPINION OF DE KLERK AS A SINCERE INDIVIDUAL EVEN THOUGH </p><p>HE REGARDS HIM AS STILL THE LEADER OF THE NATIONAL PARTY </p><p>AND NOT MORE THAN THAT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>COMMITMENT ON SAG AND MDM SIDE TO REDUCE CONFRONTATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  MOOSA AGREED THAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS MUCH LESS TENSE </p><p>THAN EVEN SIX MONTHS AGO.  FOR EXAMPLE, LAST YEAR THE </p><p>RETURN TO SCHOOL RESULTED IN THE USUAL ACCUSATIONS AND </p><p>PHYSICAL CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>EDUCATION AND TRAINING (DET), AIDED BY THE POLICE, </p><p>AND STUDENTS SUPPORTED BY PARENTS, TEACHERS AND THE MDM. </p><p>THIS YEAR THERE IS AN EVEN WORSE CRISIS DUE TO LACK OF </p><p>SPACE IN BLACK SCHOOLS AND THE FAILURE OF OVER 100,000 </p><p>STUDENTS TO PASS THEIR "MATRIC EXAMS." YET THERE IS A NEW </p><p>SPIRIT OF DIALOGUE AT THE DET AND ACTIVISTS ARE </p><p>THEREFORE ABLE TO CHANNEL STUDENT FRUSTRATIONS IN A CON- </p><p>STRUCTIVE MANNER. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE SAG\'S NEW "TACTIC" OF ALLOWING DISSENT AND </p><p>ENGAGING IN DIALOGUE INSTEAD OF STONEWALLING "IS WORKING </p><p>FOR THEM," MOOSA SAID.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER, THAT IT </p><p>COULD ALSO, IF DEALT WITH POSITIVELY, WORK FOR THE MDM </p><p>AND ANC.  THOUGH AN ABSENCE OF DIRECT CONFRONTATION IS </p><p>"DEMOBILIZING FOR THE MASSES," FEWER RAW NERVES AMONG </p><p>ACTIVISTS COULD MAKE THEM MORE AMENABLE TO THE ANC\'S </p><p>INCREASINGLY PRAGMATIC STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THE SAG. </p><p>THAT STRATEGY, MOOSA SAID, IS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY MANY </p><p>ACTIVISTS, ESPECIALLY YOUTH, WHO FEAR A SELL-OUT OF THEIR </p><p>CAUSE.  THERE REMAINS A LOT TO DO TO EXPLAIN THE VIRTUES </p><p>OF FLEXIBILITY TO THEM. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>PAC AND BC -- A THORN IN THE SIDE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  MOOSA DESCRIBED THE CONFERENCE ON A DEMOCRATIC </p><p>FUTURE AS "NOT A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE IN COOPERATION." </p><p>HE OPINED THAT THE PAC AND BC COULD TURN OUT TO BE A </p><p>REAL PROBLEM.  HE EXPECTS THEM TO REMAIN ALOOF, SNIPING </p><p>AT THE ANC\'S POSITIONS FROM THE SIDELINES AND STIRRING </p><p>UP YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>JESSE JACKSON VISIT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  MOOSA INQUIRED ABOUT THE DATES FOR JESSE JACKSON\'S </p><p>VISIT AND EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT JACKSON HAD MET WITH </p><p>THE PRESS AT SOUTH AFRICAN AMBASSADOR KOORNHOF\'S </p><p>RESIDENCE.  MOOSA FEARED THAT THE SAG WAS GOING TOO GOOD </p><p>A JOB OF CULTIVATING JACKSON AND THAT HE MIGHT RETURN </p><p>TO THE US AND ANNOUNCE THAT SANCTIONS SHOULD BE LIFTED. </p><p>MOOSA APPEARED TO HAVE GREATER CONFIDENCE IN KOORNHOF\'S </p><p>PERSUASIVE ABILITY THAN IN THAT OF THE SACC LEADERSHIP </p><p>WHICH IS HOSTING THE JACKSON VISIT. </p><p> </p><p>BAQUET </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
