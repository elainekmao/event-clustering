<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001319 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION POWELL OP-ED ON ZIM UNDER FIRE; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Powell is a slow learner" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" dedicated </p><p>      its June 27 editorial to criticizing Secretary of </p><p>      State Colin Powell for penning a critical op-ed in </p><p>      the "New York Times" on Robert Mugabe\'s government. </p><p>      Excerpts follow: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "American Secretary of State Colin Powell, despised </p><p>      throughout the world as a boot-licking Uncle Tom by </p><p>      all self-respecting people of color, is a </p><p>      disappointing slow learner. . .Several important </p><p>      facts must have struck Powell when he was dismissed </p><p>      in South Africa if he had been endowed with a bit of </p><p>      wit.  The first is that he is not as powerful and as </p><p>      popular as he fancies himself.  The second and most </p><p>      important one is that while the U. S., Britain and </p><p>      Australia top the list of a few countries rabidly </p><p>      opposed to the land reform program in Zimbabwe, they </p><p>      are not the international community. . .We feel that </p><p>      Powell, who is part of the Bush regime, which </p><p>      invaded Iraq and mercilessly slaughtered thousands </p><p>      of unarmed, innocent civilians including women and </p><p>      children, is not the best person to lecture anyone </p><p>      on democracy, rule of law and human rights. . .If </p><p>      Powell really cares about these values, why was he </p><p>      party to the Iraqi invasion?  Why is he silent on </p><p>      the dire situation in the DRC and Liberia?  As a </p><p>      starting point towards being useful, Powell should </p><p>      advise his cronies in the Bush regime to apologize </p><p>      to the world and the Iraqi people for lying about </p><p>      the situation in Iraqi and waging a senseless and </p><p>      cruel war against that country. . .South African </p><p>      Foreign Affairs spokesman Mr. Ronnie Mamoepa, </p><p>      commenting on Powell\'s hate campaign against </p><p>      Zimbabwe, said: `I would urge you to ignore Powell.\' </p><p>      We concur." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
