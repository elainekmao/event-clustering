<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002371 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>COMMERCE FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>USAID FOR MSCOVILL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, JO, WTRO, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: EU ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT DOES LITTLE FOR JORDAN\'S </p><p>ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Jordan\'s Association Agreement with the EU entered </p><p>into force May 1 after a five-year ratification process that </p><p>had frustrated Jordan and embarrassed EU diplomats here. </p><p>While both sides have publicly lauded the agreement as a </p><p>catalyst for investment and trade, privately the GOJ, EU and </p><p>business community are far less enthusiastic about the </p><p>agreement\'s potential for boosting Jordanian economic </p><p>development.  Instead, the most likely effect of the </p><p>agreement will be a stronger push by the EU to bring Jordan </p><p>into conformity with European positions on WTO regulatory </p><p>issues like GMO labeling and technical standards and </p><p>certifications.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (FINALLY) LAUNCHED </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  On May 1, an Association Agreement between the EU </p><p>and Jordan, signed in 1997,  entered into force.  The </p><p>agreement, which is part of the broader "Euro-Mediterranean </p><p>Partnership" that also includes political, security and </p><p>cultural elements, will eliminate tariffs on most traded </p><p>goods over a twelve-year phase-in period.  Ratification of </p><p>the agreement was quick on the Jordanian side, but was held </p><p>up for five years in the EU due to delays and quibbles from a </p><p>number of EU member parliaments (Belgium alone held up the </p><p>agreement for roughly a year).  The EU mission here plans a </p><p>low-key launching event, noting with chagrin that they prefer </p><p>not to highlight the fact that it took so long to finalize </p><p>the agreement.  They added that future Association </p><p>Agreements, such as the one recently signed by Algeria, will </p><p>not require ratification by all member state parliaments. </p><p> </p><p>PUBLIC PLAUDITS </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Jordanian Trade Minister Salah al Bashir welcomed </p><p>the agreement, expressing hope that it would help attract </p><p>foreign investment into the kingdom and increase the </p><p>competitiveness of Jordanian businesses through competition </p><p>and technology transfer.  European Commissioner for External </p><p>Affairs Chris Patten added his enthusiasm for the agreement </p><p>in a half-page feature in the English-language Jordan Times </p><p>on May 9.  Patten\'s comments put the advantages under the </p><p>agreement in the broader context of the "Euro-Mediterranean </p><p>Partnership," joining free trade with human rights, migration </p><p>issues, and security cooperation.  Patten\'s statement </p><p>envisaged a free trade area where "a fabric could be produced </p><p>in France or Egypt, dyed in Hungary and made into a dress in </p><p>Jordan for export to Ireland without paying any duty." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (u)  The agreement undoubtedly offers some initial </p><p>benefits to Jordan.  It opens to Jordanian goods a large, </p><p>developed market that is much closer than the US, and hence </p><p>allows for lower shipping costs.  In addition, the agreement </p><p>immediately opens the European market to select Jordanian </p><p>agricultural exports, including oranges, grapefruit, and </p><p>dried vegetables - though none of these is a major Jordanian </p><p>export.  And the promise of a free trade area probably helped </p><p>spur Jordanian pharmaceutical companies to expand into the </p><p>European market.  Europe is now a major growth market for </p><p>Jordanian pharmaceuticals, with five different Jordanian </p><p>firms obtaining European health authority approval to market </p><p>specific products in the EU in 2001.  That said, total </p><p>Jordanian exports to the EU have fallen in three of the last </p><p>four years, and in 2001 were less than JD 50 million ($70 </p><p>million), or three percent of Jordan\'s exports.  In contrast, </p><p>Jordanian exports to the US in 2001 were over JD 164 million </p><p>($231 million), up from JD 44.8 million ($63 million) in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>PRIVATE RESERVATIONS </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Whatever was said in public, contacts in the Trade </p><p>Ministry, the EU mission, and the business community all </p><p>concur that the agreement has some serious shortcomings that </p><p>will keep it from having a measurable impact on bilateral </p><p>trade or Jordanian economic development.  First, because </p><p>trade benefits are tied into a broader political and security </p><p>dialogue, those benefits can be held up at the whim of any EU </p><p>member country that has a human rights or immigration dispute </p><p>with Jordan.  They note that while this might not affect </p><p>Jordan directly, it could affect other Euromed partners like </p><p>Egypt, which could in turn affect Jordan\'s ability to secure </p><p>inputs for products to be sold to EU countries.  Our EU </p><p>mission contacts admitted this could be a stumbling block </p><p>down the road. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Second, the rules of origin provisions of the </p><p>agreement are too restrictive to be of much benefit.  Trade </p><p>Ministry Secretary General Samer Tawil provided an </p><p>illustrative example:  under US textile rules of origin (and </p><p>hence under the QIZ and FTA), fabric from a third country </p><p>that is doubly substantially transformed can count as </p><p>Jordanian for the purposes of country of origin </p><p>determination.  Europe has no such provision for double </p><p>substantial transformation.  Thus any garment made in Jordan </p><p>for export under the Association Agreement must be made of </p><p>cloth from Jordan or another Euromed country.  Since Jordan </p><p>has no cotton crop and produces little cloth, it would have </p><p>to buy from Egypt or France, making production </p><p>cost-prohibitive.  Since Jordan has little in the way of </p><p>natural resources, it would have to source most of its inputs </p><p>from Europe, eliminating any comparative advantage it had in </p><p>labor cost. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  Third, market access is restricted on those products </p><p>that Jordan might reasonably have a shot at exporting </p><p>competitively.  In agriculture, most products are subject to </p><p>"gradual liberalisation" following a "reciprocal approach," </p><p>according to Patten.  The agreement provides for quota </p><p>restrictions on many agricultural products, with access to </p><p>the EU market restricted to certain times of the year. </p><p>According to our EU contacts, a number of EU members have </p><p>already blocked access for sensitive agricultural products </p><p>from Mediterranean countries, notably Spain\'s action to </p><p>restrict olive oil imports.  With Jordan\'s few key </p><p>agricultural exports directly competitive with sensitive EU </p><p>sectors, the opportunites for greater trade are limited. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  While the trade and investment opportunities created </p><p>by the Association Agreement are limited, there is likely to </p><p>be more movement on institution-building issues.  As our EU </p><p>contact noted, this agreement is more about regulatory </p><p>capacity building than anything else.  Patten\'s statement </p><p>emphasized "a process of alignment of policies and </p><p>regulations...with a view to create a single </p><p>Euro-Mediterranean market, for example in the fields of </p><p>technical standards, conformity assessments and </p><p>certifications."  In short, we can expect the EU to use this </p><p>agreement to try to mold partner countries in their own image </p><p>on issues of trade policy.  This could have significant </p><p>downstream impacts on positions with regard to labeling, </p><p>GMO\'s, SPS, and similar issues in the WTO.  We will continue </p><p>to monitor these efforts, and to work closely with the GOJ to </p><p>ensure it maintains its close partnership with the US on </p><p>central WTO issues. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
