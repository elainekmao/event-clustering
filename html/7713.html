However, General Franks turned </p><p>this disappointment into an advantage by ordering U.S. </p><p>vessels to leave Turkish waters, Rumsfeld said.  Papers also </p><p>carry in detail meetings held by Congressman Robert Wexler, </p><p>the Cochairman of the Turkey Caucus.  Wexler said that the </p><p>U.S. was `shocked\' to see that Ankara was approaching Iran </p><p>and Syria while the war with Iraq was going on, raising </p><p>concerns in Washington that Turkey might join the `other </p><p>front.\'  In a meeting with Wexler, opposition party CHP </p><p>deupty Onur Oymen reminded Wexler that a former U.S. </p><p>Secretary of State had paid 22 visits to Damascus, skipping </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Ankara each time, when Syria was openly supporting </p><p>terrorism.  Wexler said that Prime Minister Erdogan and </p><p>Foreign Minister Gul reaffirmed Turkey\'s commitment to the </p><p>strategic partnership with the U.S., and added that question </p><p>marks about U.S. ties with Turkey had been removed.  Foreign </p><p>Minister Gul is due in Damascus, Syria on Tuesday.  Turkey, </p><p>Iran and Syria, neighboring countries with significant </p><p>Kurdish populations, are worried that a division of Iraq </p><p>might produce an independent Kurdish state.  Ankara has been </p><p>careful to avoid the impression of forming a bloc with </p><p>Tehran and Damascus, but now aims to strengthen ties with </p><p>them since the U.S. is ambiguous about the future of Iraq. </p><p>Gul is expected to urge theSyrian leadership to reduce </p><p>tension with the U.S., papers speculate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Greek Cypriots queued up for 13 km in their cars to </p><p>visit the Turkish side on Monday.  An estimated 100,000 </p><p>Greek Cypriots crossed the border to the Turkish Cypriot </p><p>sector in one week.  The Greek Cypriot administration is </p><p>expected to announce new incentives for Turkish Cypriots, </p><p>such as granting work permits or allowing marketing of </p><p>Turkish goods in South Cyprus.  The Greeks are also </p><p>considering a deal with Turkish GSM companies to expand </p><p>mobile phone communication in Cyprus.  The two communities </p><p>on the island are expected to celebrate May Day together for </p><p>the first time since 1974.  Tuesday\'s TV reported that the </p><p>Turkish Cypriot administration has decided to allow Greek </p><p>Cypriots visiting the north to stay in hotels for up to </p><p>three days.  The Turks have also decided to open two new </p><p>border crossings to ease passage of Greek Cypriots. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New package for EU criteria: Papers report that Ankara is </p><p>preparing new reforms to meet the Copenhagen Criteria, and </p><p>thus begin accession talks with the EU in 2004.  According </p><p>to the package, the role of the National Security Council </p><p>(NSC) will be restricted, and Article 8 of the anti-terror </p><p>law -- one of the main obstacles to freedom of expression -- </p><p>will be scrapped.  The ban on Kurdish names will be removed, </p><p>and broadcast in Kurdish will be allowed.  International </p><p>observers will be allowed to monitor elections in Turkey. </p><p>Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said the government will </p><p>cooperate with NGOs to meet the political criteria for </p><p>accession.  EU expansion commissioner Verheugen said that </p><p>accession talks with Ankara could begin in the first half of </p><p>2005.  Verheugen stressed that the significance of the </p><p>military in Turkey is clear, but that new regulations are </p><p>needed to rearrange the role of the TGS in politics.  He </p><p>added that no military representatives should take part in </p><p>education and broadcast institutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: Post Saddam governance </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rebuilding Iraq" </p><p>Turgut Tarhanli wrote in the liberal-intellectual Radikal </p><p>(4/29): "It seems that the US is inclined to keep the United </p><p>Nations out of the picture in the future of Iraq\'s political </p><p>structure.  As for the rebuilding, it is odd to see that </p><p>American firms are given the major share in construction </p><p>projects by the US, which happens to be the occupying force </p><p>in the country.  . It remains to be seen to what extent the </p><p>US will be successful in establishing a legitimate political </p><p>and administrative structure in Iraq while at the same time </p><p>remaining as an occupation force.  Initial signs are not </p><p>promising though, because Washington is busy with correcting </p><p>the remarks by a retired American general who is designated </p><p>to be the chief of the Iraqi restructuring mission. . The </p><p>question yet to be answered: How will the US be able to </p><p>legitimize the restructuring process even though the </p><p>operation itself was suffering from a lack of legitimacy to </p><p>begin with?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"To take a look at Iraq once again" </p><p>Omer Celik, an MP of the ruling AKP (and a close advisor to </p><p>PM Erdogan) wrote in the tabloid Star (4/29): "Turkey did </p><p>not see the full picture on the Iraq issue, and made a </p><p>mistake when designing its `red lines.\'  Turkey viewed the </p><p>entire issue through the prism of northern Iraq, and the </p><p>northern Iraq issue itself was minimized to the `Turkoman </p><p>card.\'  Northern Iraq is certainly more important to Turkey </p><p>than to other countries in the region.  However, the Turkish </p><p>strategy for Iraq requires a wider perspective. . First of </p><p>all, the military operation against Iraq has ended by </p><p>turning the US into an immediate neighbor for Turkey.  It </p><p>seems that the US presence will be longer and will include a </p><p>different strategy. . Turkey should pay attention to the </p><p>policies the US will pursue in Iraq.  It is very likely </p><p>that, just as France and the UK adopted their models </p><p>everywhere they went, the US will try to adapt its federal </p><p>system to the conditions in Iraq.  The US began the </p><p>operation without legitimacy, so the legitimacy issue will </p><p>have to be sorted out during the restructuring of Iraq. </p><p>During this process, the US will be more `pragmatic\' and </p><p>`flexible\' in its own red lines.  As for Turkey, it is wrong </p><p>to pursue a solid and static stance regarding Ankara\'s `red </p><p>lines\' which prevents Turkey from adapting itself to the </p><p>regional dynamics. . Turkey is in a process which calls for </p><p>the reevaluation of its regional perspectives." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
