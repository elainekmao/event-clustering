<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000803 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CA/OCS/ACS/NESA, DS/OP/NEA AND DS/DSS/ITA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, PTER, ASEC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT:  New Peril on the Trails - Maoist Banditry </p><p>Against Foreigners </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  01 Kathmandu 2323 </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary.  Three recent incidents of Maoists demanding </p><p>"donations" from American citizens in Nepal\'s </p><p>backcountry, coupled with an increase in reported </p><p>robberies from other Western tourists, create a new area </p><p>of concern for the security of American citizens </p><p>traveling in Nepal\'s remote areas.  Questions about </p><p>whether previous robberies were perpetrated by local </p><p>hoodlums rather than Maoists no longer apply.  Clear </p><p>evidence indicates that in all three of these attacks </p><p>against American citizens (and other Westerners who have </p><p>been robbed recently) the perpetrators were Maoists. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Sudden End for Karnali River Raft Trips </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2. ConOff received a phone call this weekend from an </p><p>anxious AmCit requesting Embassy assistance to get out </p><p>of Nepal early after his rafting excursion was held up </p><p>by armed Maoists on the Karnali River in Western Nepal. </p><p>The incident occurred two days prior to the end of the </p><p>nine-day raft trip, below the confluence of the Seti and </p><p>Karnali Rivers in Kailali District when armed Maoists </p><p>(first five, then 30 in number) entered the group\'s </p><p>evening camp. </p><p> </p><p>3. The raft company\'s managing director later confirmed </p><p>to ConOff that the Maoists, armed with guns and socket </p><p>bombs, spouted Maoist philosophy to his staff while </p><p>demanding they give up one of the expedition\'s rafts "as </p><p>help for the country".  The Maoists\' initial demands </p><p>also included 50 USD per "client"  -- they settled for </p><p>10,000 rupees total (approx. 130 USD) plus several life </p><p>jackets.  The raft company\'s director, who also serves </p><p>as President of Nepal\'s Rafting Association, has told </p><p>all other rafting companies to cease running the Karnali </p><p>River for the indefinite future.  This rafting run is in </p><p>a rather remote area within striking distance of the </p><p>Maoist heartland.  We were frankly surprised to learn </p><p>that the Karnali River was still being run by rafting </p><p>expeditions. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists Hit Climbing Expeditions to Makalu </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>4. On April 20, a Nepali daily newspaper reported an </p><p>American climber\'s web-site description of Maoist </p><p>robberies hitting three international expeditions during </p><p>their approach to climb the world\'s fifth highest peak, </p><p>Makalu.  The Himalayan Times story, entitled "Now, </p><p>Maoists target tourists", states in pertinent part: </p><p> </p><p>     According to the Associated Press, one of the </p><p>     mountaineers, who wrote about the incident on the </p><p>     Internet website on Friday, said climbers belonging </p><p>     to three teams were forced to give Rs 10, 000 ($128) </p><p>     each to the guerrillas.  The teams were robbed on </p><p>     their way to the base camp, from where they posted </p><p>     their report on the website. [Note: website is </p><p>     located at EverestNews.com] </p><p> </p><p>     "A group of five Maoists - four wearing special </p><p>     jackets and carrying grenades along with an armed </p><p>     Maoist carrying an automatic rifle - came to our </p><p>     camp on April 5 morning," Raymond Coughron, an </p><p>     energy management consultant from Berkeley, </p><p>     California, said.  In the beginning, the guerrillas </p><p>     demanded Rs. 5,000 ($64) plus cameras, binoculars </p><p>     and altimeters, but after some negotiations, they </p><p>     settled for Rs 10,000 ($128) per member, Coughron </p><p>     said. </p><p> </p><p>     "It was clear that they were not alone. In the </p><p>     surrounding forests, hundreds of their comrades </p><p>     could be seen," he said.  "After our expedition </p><p>     members paid them the amount and received a receipt, </p><p>     the Maoists went to members of the Swiss expedition </p><p>     team and repeated the act. The Spanish expedition </p><p>     was approached the night before," he stated. </p><p> </p><p>Fulbrighter Threatened and Robbed, Reportedly Because of </p><p>USG Sponsorship </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. American Fulbright scholar Jeffrey Potter reports that </p><p>on February 23, he and his fianc  were visited in their </p><p>residence "by the local Maoist commander and 23 of his </p><p>armed friends". Potter, a University of Wisconsin grad </p><p>student who formerly served as a Peace Corps volunteer </p><p>here, was conducting ethnographic research in the small </p><p>village of Benchan located in remote Sankhuwasaba </p><p>District .  During the ensuing half-hour lecture, the </p><p>commander informed Potter that the Maoists liked him </p><p>personally, but that they didn\'t like the U.S. Government </p><p>and, because he was sponsored by the USG it was time for </p><p>him to go.  The Maoists also relieved Potter of 2,000 </p><p>rupees (26 USD) and his camera.  He left the village </p><p>immediately and continues to write up his research within </p><p>the confines of the Kathmandu Valley. </p><p> </p><p>Incidents on the Rise -- Maoists or Hoodlums? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Although robberies of Westerners on the trail have </p><p>been reported several times in the past, it was </p><p>previously unclear whether some of these incidents were </p><p>perpetrated by actual Maoists or simply local gangs of </p><p>youths.  There are, undoubtedly, thefts by hoodlums. </p><p>However, the circumstances of recent incidents strongly </p><p>indicate that Maoist cadres are committing many, if not </p><p>most, of the rising spate of robberies in Nepal\'s </p><p>hinterlands.  Weapons and uniforms are not the only </p><p>indicators of Maoist affiliation.  Maoists </p><p>characteristically detain their victims for some time - </p><p>they don\'t just take the money and run.  The often spend </p><p>hours haranguing the Westerners\' Nepali guides and </p><p>porters about Maoist philosophy, ridiculing them for not </p><p>taking part in the "great work" and attempting to convert </p><p>them to the cause.  They often provide printed "donation </p><p>receipts" embossed with the likenesses of Mao, Lenin, </p><p>Stalin, Marx and Engels. </p><p> </p><p>7. Another telling proof of Maoist involvement is the </p><p>increase in the number of robberies that have occurred </p><p>since the end of November when the Maoists abrogated </p><p>their cease-fire with the GON.  In the same week as the </p><p>first large scale attacks, including the battle in Phaplu </p><p>where an AmCit student spent the night hiding under a </p><p>stairwell (see Reftel), there were three separate </p><p>instances where Dutch trekkers were held up and robbed of </p><p>cameras and money by Maoists in nearby Salleri.  Within </p><p>the past four months more than a dozen Western trekking </p><p>parties have been detained and robbed. </p><p> </p><p>8. On March 5, armed Maoists stopped a trekking party on </p><p>the previously heavily traveled Milkedanda trail near </p><p>Chainpur, Sankhuwasaba District.  After confiscating </p><p>cameras and money the trekkers were told "Thank you for </p><p>your donation, but never come to this area again".   In </p><p>Mugu District, German trekkers were robbed by a well- </p><p>armed group of young attackers (reportedly all aged </p><p>between 9 - 20 years and mostly girls).  Other German </p><p>parties have recently been held up and robbed by armed </p><p>groups in Rowailing Valley (Dolakha District) and in </p><p>Humla District, where Westerners often embark for the </p><p>overland "pilgrimage" route to Mount Kailash in Tibet. </p><p>[Note: ConOffs arranged an emergency helicopter </p><p>evacuation of Americans from Simikot, Humla two months </p><p>ago in the midst of a battle between Maoists and GON </p><p>forces.  End Note]  A British climbing group headed </p><p>toward Kanchanjanga Base Camp (in the far eastern </p><p>district of Taplejung) was also robbed and most of its </p><p>equipment was carried off by alleged Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>9. Because of the number of recent trail robberies and </p><p>other security concerns, the French Embassy has issued a </p><p>warning advising French travelers to confine their Nepal </p><p>forays solely to the Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Chitwan </p><p>National Nature Reserve and the Annapurna, Langtang and </p><p>Everest treks.  [Note: Last Thursday Maoists bombed and </p><p>destroyed a major bridge on the only road linking </p><p>Kathmandu with the Langtang trek trailhead, effectively </p><p>cutting off access for the time being.  We expect that </p><p>the bridge will be restored fairly soon. End Note.]  In </p><p>an effort to bolster lagging tourist arrivals, the GON </p><p>last Fall opened approximately 100 new mountains as </p><p>"trekking peaks" with lowered climbing fees. </p><p>Unfortunately, most of these new "trekking peaks" are </p><p>located in regions where we cannot presently advise U.S. </p><p>citizens that it is safe to travel.  Royal Bardia </p><p>National Park is virtually closed down, because of Maoist </p><p>activities in the area.  The adventure experience in </p><p>Nepal is swiftly becoming constricted. </p><p> </p><p>10. [Comment] The sudden rash of international tourists </p><p>accosted during expeditions and treks by Maoists for </p><p>money and equipment is a major new area of concern for </p><p>the security of Americans visiting Nepal.  The Embassy\'s </p><p>current advice for Americans is to avoid all nighttime </p><p>road travel outside the Kathmandu Valley, to limit road </p><p>travel outside the Valley to the greatest extent possible </p><p>and to contact the Embassy before undertaking travel to </p><p>outlying areas.  If security conditions continue to </p><p>worsen, we may be forced to tighten the caution </p><p>concerning travel outside the Valley even further. </p><p>Malinowski </p><p></p></div>
