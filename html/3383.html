<p>UNCLAS ROME 003680 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, IT, ITALIAN POLITICS </p><p>SUBJECT: PM BERLUSCONI WILL ALSO REMAIN FM BERLUSCONI "FOR </p><p>A FEW MORE MONTHS" </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ROME 03651 B) ROME 3600 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  DESPITE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MUSINGS FROM VARIOUS </p><p>SOURCES IN THE GOI (REPORTED REFTELS), PM BERLUSCONI WILL NOT </p><p>RELINQUISH HIS POST AS INTERIM FOREIGN MINISTER ANY TIME </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03680  251544Z </p><p>SOON.  REFTELS REPORTED THAT THE PM WAS LIKELY TO ANNOUNCE </p><p>SOON THE APPOINTMENT OF CURRENT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC </p><p>ADMINISTRATION AND SECURITY FRANCO FRATTINI AS FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  DURING HIS ADDRESS TO A CONFERENCE FOR ITALIAN </p><p>AMBASSADORS IN ROME ON JULY 24, HOWEVER, BERLUSCONI SAID THAT </p><p>HE WOULD KEEP THE MFA INTERIM POST "FOR A FEW MORE MONTHS, OR </p><p>MAYBE EVEN LONGER."  HE EXPLAINED THAT HE IS THE HEAD OF A </p><p>COALITION GOVERNMENT, AND THAT "WITHIN THIS COALITION, THE </p><p>CONDITIONS TO APPOINT A NEW FOREIGN MINISTER HAVE NOT YET </p><p>RIPENED."  BERLUSCONI ASSURED THE AMBASSADORS THAT HE WOULD </p><p>TRY TO BE "MORE PRESENT, MORE UP TO THE TASK, TO MEET YOUR </p><p>EXPECTATIONS."  HE ALSO ADMITTED THAT WHEN THE TIME FINALLY </p><p>COMES TO GIVE UP THE MFA, HE WILL MISS THE JOB. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  COMMENT.  IN CITING THE COALITION GOVERNMENT AS </p><p>THE REASON FOR DELAYING HIS DECISION ON A NEW FM, BERLUSCONI </p><p>PROBABLY HAD IN MIND THE FACT THAT GIVING FRATTINI THE MFA </p><p>WOULD MEAN THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES </p><p>(FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENSE, ECONOMY, AND INTERIOR) WOULD BE </p><p>RUN BY FORZA ITALIA (FI - BERLUSCONI\'S PARTY) MEMBERS.  WE </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS IN THE COALITION, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, ARE PUSHING FOR MORE POSITIONS.  THIS DOES NOT </p><p>BODE WELL FOR FRATTINI\'S CHANCES.  THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF </p><p>THE PARTIES COMPRISING THE COALITION WILL NOT CHANGE OVER THE </p><p>NEXT FEW MONTHS.  BARRING A MAJOR SHUFFLE IN THE CABINET </p><p>(SOMETHING BERLUSCONI HAS SAID HE IS RELUCTANT TO DO), IT MAY </p><p>BE THAT BERLUSCONI IS STALLING FOR TIME TO CAST HIS NET WIDER </p><p>IN THE SEARCH FOR A CAPABLE AND, FROM PARLIAMENT\'S </p><p>STANDPOINT, ACCEPTABLE FM. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03680  251544Z </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  COMMENT CONTINUED.  DESPITE BERLUSCONI\'S PROMISE </p><p>TO BE MORE VISIBLE AT THE MFA, IT WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO HANDLE BOTH THE PM AND FM JOBS </p><p>EFFECTIVELY.  "A FEW MORE MONTHS" MEANS HE WILL RETAIN THE FM </p><p>POSITION AT LEAST UNTIL JUST BEFORE, OR THROUGH, THE NATO </p><p>SUMMIT IN PRAGUE.  GIVEN THE DETAILS TO BE HAMMERED OUT ON </p><p>ENLARGEMENT IN THE RUN-UP TO PRAGUE, THE LACK OF A FULL TIME </p><p>FM COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR THE GOI.  IN ADDITION, THE MFA </p><p>HAS STARTED PREPARATIONS FOR ITALY\'S EU PRESIDENCY IN JULY </p><p>2003.  BERLUSCONI MAY FIND THAT THE BURDEN OF TWO CABINET </p><p>POSITIONS WILL FORCE HIM TO EXPEDITE HIS CHOICE FOR FM. </p><p>RESPECTED MEDIA ANALYSTS ARE INCREASINGLY SUGGESTING JUST </p><p>THIS. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03680 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
