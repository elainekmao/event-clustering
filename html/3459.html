<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 003880 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE, EUR/RPM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, MARR, XF, IZ, MOPS, MARR, XF, IZ, IT, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ:  MARTINO CAUSES STIR OVER ITALIAN SUPPORT </p><p>FOR U.S. MILITARY INTERVENTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ROME 3760 B) ROME 3795 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DCM THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY:  ITALIAN DEFENSE MINISTER MARTINO CAUSED A </p><p>STIR AMONG ITALIAN POLITICAL LEADERS AND COMMENTATORS BY </p><p>SUGGESTING THAT ITALY WOULD "AUTOMATICALLY" SUPPORT U.S. </p><p>MILITARY INTERVENTION IN IRAQ.  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT ITALY </p><p>WOULD ONLY PARTICIPATE IN THE MILITARY EFFORT IF THERE IS </p><p>"PROVEN EVIDENCE" OF IRAQ\'S CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE WEAPONS OF </p><p>MASS DESTRUCTION (WMD).  OPPOSITION FORCES REACTED WITH </p><p>OUTRAGE, WHILE OTHER GOI OFFICIALS HASTENED TO TONE DOWN </p><p>MARTINO\'S MESSAGE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED IN THE AUGUST 8 ISSUE OF </p><p>THE CENTRIST NEWS WEEKLY "PANORAMA," ITALIAN MOD ANTONIO </p><p>MARTINO SAID THAT, AT A RECENT NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS MEETING </p><p>IN BRUSSELS, HE AND HIS EUROPEAN COLLEAGUES DISCUSSED WITH </p><p>SECRETARY RUMSFELD THE PROBABLE EXISTENCE OF WMD PLANTS IN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>IRAQ.  MARTINO SAID THAT IT WOULD BE "IRRESPONSIBLE" NOT TO </p><p>TAKE ACTION IF THERE IS POSITIVE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH </p><p>PRODUCTION FACILITIES EXIST. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) CAUTIOUS AS USUAL WHEN IT COMES TO COMMITTING </p><p>ITALIAN MILITARY PARTICIPATION, HOWEVER, MARTINO REMARKED </p><p>THAT THE "LITMUS TEST" ON WHETHER OR NOT TO ENGAGE IN </p><p>MILITARY ACTIVITY AGAINST IRAQ IS THE ISSUE OF UN INSPECTORS. </p><p> IF SADDAM HUSSEIN ALLOWS THE UNCONDITIONAL RETURN OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03880  01 OF 02  071000Z </p><p>INSPECTORS, HE ARGUED, THERE WILL BE NO NEED FOR MILITARY </p><p>INTERVENTION.  IF, INSTEAD, THE IRAQI LEADER CONTINUES TO </p><p>BLOCK THEIR RETURN, MARTINO INFERRED THAT THIS WOULD BE </p><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR MILITARY ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) ACCORDING TO PRESS STATEMENTS, MARTINO BELIEVES THE </p><p>U.S. IS RIGHT IN NOT WANTING TO WAIT INDEFINITELY BEFORE </p><p>STRIKING, GIVEN THE POSSIBLE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL THREAT </p><p>FROM IRAQ.  STILL, HE DOES NOT BELIEVE U.S. ACTION IS </p><p>IMMINENT, SINCE WASHINGTON WILL FIRST WANT TO BUILD THE </p><p>WIDEST POSSIBLE INTERNATIONAL COALITION -- POSSIBLY WIDER </p><p>THAN DESERT STORM IN 1991, AND INCLUDING THE RUSSIAN </p><p>FEDERATION.  MARTINO SAID THAT, IF THE U.S. EVENTUALLY </p><p>DECIDES TO ATTACK, ITALY, AS A CLOSE U.S. ALLY, WOULD </p><p>"AUTOMATICALLY" MAKE ITS AIR SPACE AVAILABLE.  THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF ITALIAN TROOPS WOULD DEPEND, HOWEVER, "ON </p><p>THE PROVEN EVIDENCE OF IRAQ\'S WAR PLANS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) RESPONDING TO MARTINO\'S STATEMENTS AND RESULTING </p><p>OPPOSITION CRITICISM, ALFREDO MANTICA, MFA UNDER SECRETARY </p><p>FOR THE MIDDLE EAST, AND MARGHERITA BONIVER, MFA UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY FOR ASIA, TOLD THE PRESS THAT MILITARY INTERVENTION </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BY AN INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE WOULD REQUIRE A UN RESOLUTION. </p><p>THEY ALSO SAID ITALY WOULD MAKE ITS DECISION ON WHETHER TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS EUROPEAN PARTNERS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH BONIVER OPINED THAT ITALY WOULD ULTIMATELY BACK THE </p><p>U.S. IF ASKED BY PRESIDENT BUSH.  ONE RULING COALITION MEMBER </p><p>IN THE SENATE CAUTIONED THAT ANY DECISION INVOLVING AN </p><p>ITALIAN MILITARY COMMITMENT MUST GO BEFORE PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) THEIR STATEMENTS DID LITTLE TO PACIFY THE OPPOSITION, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03880  01 OF 02  071000Z </p><p>WHICH PROTESTED MARTINO\'S "DISCONCERTING" STATEMENTS AND </p><p>"SUBMISSIVE" ATTITUDE TOWARD THE UNITED STATES.  OVER 70 </p><p>LEADERS OF THE LEFT AND CENTER-LEFT SIGNED A PETITION </p><p>OPPOSING MILITARY INTERVENTION IN IRAQ.  MANY COMMENTATORS </p><p>POINT TO THE DANGERS OF AN ATTACK ON IRAQ ON MIDDLE EAST </p><p>STABILITY AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, WHILE OPPOSITION FORCES ARE </p><p>CALLING FOR AN END TO THE UN EMBARGO AGAINST IRAQ AND ARE </p><p>APPEALING TO OTHER LEFTIST FORCES IN EUROPE TO TAKE POLITICAL </p><p>ACTION TO MAKE CLEAR EUROPE\'S OPPOSITION TO AN EXTENSION OF </p><p>THE CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) SOME IN ITALY SPECULATE THAT THE U.S. REQUEST FOR </p><p>MORE ITALIAN TROOPS IN OEF IS AN EFFORT TO FREE UP U.S. </p><p>TROOPS AND THUS A SIGNAL OF U.S. INTENTIONS TO ATTACK IRAQ. </p><p>ALTHOUGH BONIVER CALLED THIS INTERPRETATION A "CREDIBLE </p><p>HYPOTHESIS," MARTINO DENIED IT, SAYING THAT ITALIAN SOLDIERS </p><p>WOULD REPLACE BRITISH, NOT AMERICAN, TROOPS AS PART OF AN </p><p>ON-GOING SIX-MONTH ROTATION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT. THE GOI UNDER PM BERLUSCONI HAS BEEN A </p><p>STRONG SUPPORTER OF U.S. MILITARY POLICY.  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>HOWEVER, IT IS EQUALLY COMMITTED TO A COMMON EUROPEAN DEFENSE </p><p>POLICY AND THEREFORE RELUCTANT TO GUARANTEE ACTIVE MILITARY </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN IRAQ -- IF AND WHEN IT BECOMES NECESSARY -- </p><p>IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EU CONSENSUS.
