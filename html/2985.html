<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 001290 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/CM, AND EAP/RSP-TC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/21/07 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, CM, VM, CVR, APEC </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM, THE PRC, AND TAIWAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01290  01 OF 03  210840Z </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RAYMOND BURGHARDT, </p><p>REASON: 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  SUMMARY.  VIETNAM HAS HAD AN OFTEN-TORTUOUS </p><p>HISTORY WITH CHINA, INCLUDING WITH THE PRC, AND IS </p><p>AWARE OF THE DISPARITY OF THE IMPORTANCE WITH WHICH THE </p><p>TWO COUNTRIES VIEW ONE ANOTHER.  MANY HERE MINIMIZE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THE PRC AS A POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC MODEL </p><p>(ALTHOUGH IT IS).  RELATIONS WITH BOTH BEIJING AND </p><p>TAIPEI ARE NOW BACK ON TRACK.  THE SOUTH CHINA SEA IS </p><p>SEEN AS VIETNAM\'S GREATEST EXTERNAL SECURITY THREAT, IF </p><p>NO LONGER AN IMMINENT ONE.  VIETNAM WATCHES WITH </p><p>INTEREST AND CONCERN EVENTS IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT, </p><p>RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL FOR REGIONAL INSTABILITY THAT </p><p>WOULD AFFECT VIETNAM.  WHILE FORMALLY COMMITTED TO A </p><p>POLICY OF "ONE CHINA," VIETNAMESE LEADERS PROBABLY DO </p><p>NOT CARE DEEPLY ABOUT WHETHER REUNIFICATION EVER TAKES </p><p>PLACE, AS LONG AS THE TWO SIDES CONTINUE TO IMPROVE </p><p>RELATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH VIETNAM.  SEPTEL </p><p>WILL EXAMINE ECONOMIC AND OTHER RELATIONS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  VIETNAM\'S SHORT-, MID-, AND LONG-TERM </p><p>INTERESTS ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON AN INCREASINGLY </p><p>COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRC, ON AVOIDANCE OF </p><p>TERRITORIAL CONFLICTS WITH THE PRC IN THE SOUTH CHINA </p><p>SEA AND THE LAND BORDER, AND ON PEACE AND PROSPERITY ON </p><p>BOTH SIDES OF THE TAIWAN STRAIT.  YET ONLY A DECADE </p><p>AGO, THE GVN WAS BARELY ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH THE PRC, </p><p>GIVEN LINGERING ENMITY OVER THE 1979 BORDER WAR AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01290  01 OF 03  210840Z </p><p>STAUNCH DISAGREEMENT OVER VIETNAM\'S OCCUPATION OF </p><p>CAMBODIA.  IN THAT SAME ERA, THE GVN HAD ONLY FLEDGLING </p><p>UNOFFICIAL TIES WITH TAIWAN, NOW PROBABLY VIETNAM\'S </p><p>LARGEST INVESTOR.  (TAIWAN DID NOT OPEN ITS </p><p>"UNOFFICIAL" OFFICE HERE UNTIL 1993; ITS TIMING </p><p>PROBABLY HAD SOME CONNECTION WITH THE EXPECTED LIFTING </p><p>OF THE US TRADE EMBARGO.)  CHINA SCHOLARS HERE HAVE </p><p>SAID THAT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HANOI TO SEEK DIPLOMATIC </p><p>RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN DURING THE NADIR OF VIETNAM/PRC </p><p>RELATIONS IN THE 1980\'S, NOR EVEN TO COURT UNOFFICIAL </p><p>TIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE DOI MOI PERIOD </p><p>BEGAN. </p><p> </p><p>HISTORY HURTS </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  VIETNAMESE FREELY ADMIT THE PERVASIVE </p><p>SOCIETAL, CULTURAL, AND LINGUISTIC INFLUENCE OF CHINA\'S </p><p>THOUSAND-YEAR OCCUPATION OF THE NORTHERN PARTS OF WHAT </p><p>IS NOW VIETNAM.  OFFICIAL HISTORIES, HOWEVER, ALSO TEND </p><p>TO HIGHLIGHT THE VALIANT AND EVENTUALLY SUCCESSFUL </p><p>VIETNAMESE EFFORTS TO WARD OFF CHINESE AGGRESSIONS, </p><p>BOTH IN THE "REGAINING" OF INDEPENDENCE IN THE MID- </p><p>TENTH CENTURY A.D. AND IN SUBSEQUENT CHINESE INVASIONS </p><p>THROUGH THE 15TH CENTURY.  MANY VIETNAMESE TALK ABOUT </p><p>THIS HISTORY AS IF IT WERE FRESH IN THEIR MEMORIES </p><p>RATHER THAN EVENTS FROM VIETNAM\'S SOMEWHAT MYSTIC PAST; </p><p>IT WOULD APPEAR THAT A THINLY VEILED RESENTMENT OF THE </p><p>BIG DRAGON TO THE NORTH IS DELIBERATELY INCULCATED IN </p><p>VIETNAMESE STUDENTS.  THE SLIGHTS AND MISFORTUNES </p><p>SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE CHINESE PLAY WELL INTO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01290  01 OF 03  210840Z </p><p>VIETNAM\'S NOTABLE VICTIM MENTALITY, WHICH ALSO </p><p>EVIDENCES ITSELF WHEN TALKING ABOUT FRENCH COLONIALISM </p><p>AND THE "AMERICAN WAR." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  IN MORE RECENT HISTORY, VIETNAMESE ARE OFTEN </p><p>PRICKLY WHEN PEOPLE MAKE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE PRC\'S </p><p>SUCCESSFUL MODERNIZATION SINCE 1978 AND VIETNAM\'S STILL </p><p>MORE MODEST DOI MOI SINCE 1986.  THEY ARE CORRECT IN </p><p>ASSERTING THAT VIETNAM\'S OWN COURSE IS TAILORED TO ITS </p><p>UNIQUE NATIONA CHARACTERISTICS, WHILE NONETHELESS </p><p>EXPRESSING ADMIRATION FOR THE PRC\'S SUCCESSES.  THEY </p><p>WILL ADMI PRIVATELY TO WATCHING CLOSELY POLICY DEBATES </p><p>WIHIN THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) -- MOST </p><p>REENTLY, ON THE TENDENTIOUS TOPIC OF ADMISSION INTO </p><p>THE PARTY OF CAPITALISTS -- AND THERE IS LITTLE IF ANY </p><p>DOUBT THAT DOI MOI WAS INITIALLY GRAFTED FAILY </p><p>DIRECTLY FROM DENG XIAOPING\'S EARLIEST REFORM.  YET </p><p>DENGIST THEORIES AND THOUGHT -- MUCH LESSMAOIST </p><p>WRITINGS -- RECEIVE SCANT ATTENTION IN </p><p>IETNAMESE IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING (STILL A MUST FOR </p><p>HIGHER EDUCATION AS WELL AS FOR ADVANCEMENT WITHIN HE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4141 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01290  02 OF 03  210840Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AIT-03   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  PERC-00 </p><p>      DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  DSCC-00  NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------B16459  210848Z /38 </p><p>R 210705Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6535 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>AIT TAIPEI 0690 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>AMCONSUL GUANGZHOU </p><p>AMCONSUL HONG KONG </p><p>AMCONSUL SHANGHAI </p><p>AMCONSUL SHENYANG </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HANOI 001290 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/CM, AND EAP/RSP-TC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01290  02 OF 03  210840Z </p><p>CIVIL SERVICE).  THE FOCUS REMAINS INSTEAD HEAVILY ON A </p><p>COMBINATION OF TRADITIONAL MARXIST/LENINIST THEORY AND </p><p>HO CHI MINH THOUGHT. </p><p> </p><p>FELLOW TRAVELERS OF TWO SORTS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  SINCE RELATIONS WITH THE PRC HAVE IMPROVED IN </p><p>THE 1990\'S, VIETNAM HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE SOLIDARITY OF </p><p>SOCIALIST COUNTRIES AS A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE NOW CLOSER </p><p>TIES BETWEEN BEIJING AND HANOI.  THERE ARE A STEADY </p><p>STREAM OF PARTY AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN BOTH </p><p>DIRECTIONS, AND IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE PRC WAS </p><p>ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTRIES THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV), NONG DUC MANH, </p><p>VISITED AFTER TAKING OFFICE IN 2001.  (WE HAVE HEARD OF </p><p>NO PLANS FOR HIM TO VISIT THE UNITED STATES, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, DESPITE THE 2001 ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE US- </p><p>VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT.)  ONE VIETNAMESE </p><p>CHINA EXPERT NOTED THAT VIETNAM\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE </p><p>PRC IS "MOSTLY IMPORTANT ON A POLITICAL LEVEL," SINCE </p><p>ECONOMIC AND TRADE TIES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE </p><p>FAR MORE MODEST THAN WITH THE U.S. OR JAPAN.  BEIJING\'S </p><p>AMBASSADOR HERE, NOW ON HIS THIRD TOUR IN VIETNAM AND A </p><p>HANOI UNIVERSITY GRADUATE, MAY BE THE MOST FLUENT </p><p>VIETNAMESE SPEAKER IN THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  YET AS THE VIETNAMESE HAVE TURNED MORE TO A </p><p>MARKET-STYLE ECONOMY, HANOI HAS ALSO BEEN KEEN TO COURT </p><p>TAIWAN AND TAIWANESE INVESTORS.  IT NOW MAINTAINS A </p><p>LARGE AND SURPRISINGLY ACTIVE "UNOFFICIAL" OFFICE IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01290  02 OF 03  210840Z </p><p>TAIPEI, HEADED BY A SENIOR FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICER. </p><p>IN ADDITION TO TRADE WORK, THE ELEVEN VIETNAMESE </p><p>EMPLOYEES AT THE OFFICE ARE PARTICIPANTS AT CHINA- </p><p>WATCHING ACTIVITIES AT TAIWAN "GOVERNMENT-RUN" THINK </p><p>TANKS.  THE TAIPEI ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL OFFICE (TECO) </p><p>IN HANOI IS MUCH SMALLER, AND WITH NO FLUENT VIETNAMESE </p><p>SPEAKERS ON ITS STAFF, BUT OBSERVERS HAVE NOTED THE </p><p>AGGRESSIVENESS OF TECO STAFF IN SEEKING CONTACTS AND </p><p>INFORMATION HERE.  THE DIRECTOR WHO LEFT EARLIER THIS </p><p>YEAR HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN THE HEAD OF TAIWAN\'S MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT.  THE TAIWAN TRADE MINISTER, </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY A LARGE ENTOURAGE OF BUSINESS LEADERS, </p><p>USUALLY VISITS VIETNAM EVERY YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>THREAT LEVEL </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  ACCORDING TO ONE VIETNAMESE ACADEMIC </p><p>SPECIALIZING IN CHINA STUDIES, "THE US AND VIETNAM ARE </p><p>THE TWO COUNTRIES THAT ARE MOST CONCERNED WITH CHINA." </p><p>(IN CONTRAST, VIETNAM IS PROBABLY NOT EVEN IN THE TOP </p><p>FIVE OR TEN OF BEIJING\'S CONCERNS, THEY ADMIT.) </p><p>DESPITE THE SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATION OF THEIR LAND BORDER </p><p>DEMARCATION IN 1999, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TONKIN GULF </p><p>MARITIME BORDER AGREEMENT HAS BEEN DELAYED BY </p><p>DIFFICULTIES IN REACHING AGREEMENT ON FISHING RIGHTS. </p><p>BOTH THE LAND AND MARITIME AGREEMENTS GENERATED </p><p>LEADERSHIP CONTROVERSY HERE, POSSIBLY CONTRIBUTING TO </p><p>LE KHA PHIEU\'S EARLY REMOVAL AS PARTY LEADER LAST YEAR. </p><p>THE AGREEMENTS ARE FAVORITE TARGETS OF CRITICISM BY </p><p>OVERSEAS VIETNAMESE AND SOME INTERNAL ACTIVISTS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01290  02 OF 03  210840Z </p><p>ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL CHINA WATCHERS HERE, CONFLICTING </p><p>CLAIMS IN WHAT THE VIETNAMESE REFER TO AS THE "EAST </p><p>SEA" -- COMMONLY KNOWN ELSEWHERE AS THE SOUTH CHINA SEA </p><p>-- REMAINS THE "BIGGEST SECURITY PROBLEM" FOR VIETNAM. </p><p>ONE OBSERVER CLAIMED THAT "YOU CAN\'T SAY IT WILL NEVER </p><p>BE RESOLVED," WHILE ADMITTING THAT SUCCESS IN THIS </p><p>ENDEAVOR MIGHT WELL NOT TAKE PLACE IN HIS LIFETIME. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  ANOTHER ACADEMIC POINTED TO THE INHERENT </p><p>DIFFICULTIES IN SEEKING RESOLUTION EVEN IN AN ASEAN </p><p>FRAMEWORK, AS NOW SEEMS TO BE THE HOPE.  SOME OBSERVERS </p><p>-- BUT NOT MANY -- HAVE OPINED THAT US OR JAPANESE </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THIS ISSUE COULD SPEED ITS RESOLUTION. </p><p>IN ANY EVENT, FEW CHINA WATCHERS HERE PUT THE RISK OF </p><p>ARMED CONFLICT OVER THE EAST SEA AS HIGH, AND NOW </p><p>(UNLIKE SEVERAL YEARS AGO) ASSUME THAT BEIJING AND </p><p>HANOI WOULD NOT ALLOW ISOLATED INCIDENTS AS MIGHT TAKE </p><p>PLACE TO ESCALATE INTO LARGER CONFLICT OR JEOPARDIZE </p><p>BILATERAL TIES. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4142 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01290  03 OF 03  210840Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AIT-03   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DS-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  IRM-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  NFAT-00  SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------B1645D  210848Z /38 </p><p>R 210705Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6536 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>AIT TAIPEI 0691 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>AMCONSUL GUANGZHOU </p><p>AMCONSUL HONG KONG </p><p>AMCONSUL SHANGHAI </p><p>AMCONSUL SHENYANG </p><p>USCINCPAC HONOLULU HI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HANOI 001290 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/CM, AND EAP/RSP-TC </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01290  03 OF 03  210840Z </p><p>10.  (C)  WHILE CLOSELY WATCHING THE SITUATION IN THE </p><p>TAIWAN STRAIT, CHINA EXPERTS IN VIETNAM RATE THE THREAT </p><p>LEVEL TO VIETNAM AS FAR LOWER THAN THE EAST SEA ISSUE. </p><p>THEY ACKNOWLEDGE, HOWEVER, THAT ANY TENSIONS OR </p><p>CONFLICT IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT WOULD NECESSARILY AFFECT </p><p>SHIPPING IN THE REGION, AND HENCE VIETNAM\'S ABILITY TO </p><p>PURSUE EXPORT-LED GROWTH. </p><p> </p><p>ONE CHINA -- DO WE CARE? </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  WHILE REGULARLY AND OPENLY EXPRESSING SUPPORT </p><p>FOR "ONE CHINA," VIETNAM PROBABLY DOES NOT CARE DEEPLY </p><p>ABOUT WHETHER OR WHEN THE TWO SIDES REUNIFY, AS LONG AS </p><p>THEY AVOID OPEN CONFLICT, CONTINUE THE IMPROVEMENT OF </p><p>TIES WITH EACH OTHER -- AND WITH VIETNAM -- AND DO NOT </p><p>POSE A THREAT TO REGIONAL TRADE AND SECURITY.  MOST </p><p>OBSERVERS HERE SEE THE PRC AS BEING INCREASINGLY </p><p>"FLEXIBLE" IN ITS APPROACH TO TAIWAN.  SOME, HOWEVER, </p><p>EXPRESS GROWING DOUBT THAT THE YOUNGER GENERATION OF </p><p>MAINLANDERS HAS THE SAME ZEAL FOR REUNIFICATION AS </p><p>THEIR ELDERS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  GVN POLICY ADVISERS CLAIM THAT VIETNAMESE </p><p>LEADERS NEVER OFFER OPINIONS TO BEIJING OR TAIPEI ABOUT </p><p>REUNIFICATION (DESPITE VIETNAM\'S EXPERIENCE WITH ITS </p><p>OWN REUNIFICATION).  CHINA WATCHERS HERE SO FAR DO NOT </p><p>EXPECT ANY SURPRISES ON TAIWAN POLICY -- OR OTHER </p><p>POLICIES -- IN BEIJING EVEN AFTER PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN </p><p>STEPS DOWN; THEY USUALLY STRESS WHAT THEY SEE AS THE </p><p>COLLECTIVE PRC AND CCP LEADERSHIP, WHICH MITIGATES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01290  03 OF 03  210840Z </p><p>AGAINST BOLD OR EXTREME MEASURES.  (FEW WOULD DARE </p><p>OPENLY DRAW THE NATURAL COMPARISON WITH VIETNAM\'S OWN </p><p>LEADERSHIP, HOWEVER.) </p><p> </p><p>PROGNOSIS:  GOOD </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  FEW STORM CLOUDS (OTHER THAN THE DIMINISHING </p><p>PROSPECT OF SOUTH CHINA SEA CONFLICT) APPEAR ON THE </p><p>HORIZON IN HANOI\'S RELATIONS WITH BEIJING AND TAIPEI. </p><p>THE PRC\'S GROWING RELATIONSHIP WITH ASEAN IS SEEN HERE </p><p>AS A PLUS, AS IS THE PARTICIPATION OF BEIJING, TAIPEI, </p><p>AND HANOI IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION </p><p>FORUM.  INCREASED FLOWS INTO VIETNAM OF CHINESE </p><p>TOURISTS, BUSINESSPEOPLE, AND INVESTORS AND EXCHANGES </p><p>OF OFFICIALS (OR NON-OFFICIALS, AS THE CASE MAY BE WITH </p><p>TAIWAN) NOT ONLY IMPROVE VIETNAMESE BILATERAL TIES WITH </p><p>EACH BUT ALSO BUTTRESS THE OVERALL TREND IN VIETNAMESE </p><p>FOREIGN POLICY SINCE 1990 OF DIVERSIFICATION AND </p><p>MULTILATERALIZATION.  BUT WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE TO LET DOWN THEIR GUARD ENTIRELY OVER THE </p><p>LONG-TERM ASPIRATIONS OR DESIGNS OF THEIR LOOMING </p><p>NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
