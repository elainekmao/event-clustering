<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002358 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ODIP, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: SEVERAL MISSIONS REQUEST U.S. HELP TO </p><p>PROTECT OR REESTABLISH THEIR DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN BAGHDAD </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Counselor Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The Polish Charge called the Ambassador April 17 to </p><p>present a formal request from the Polish government for U.S. </p><p>assistance in reestablishing its diplomatic presence in </p><p>Baghdad.  On April 16 we also received a formal diplomatic </p><p>note from the Romanian Embassy in Amman requesting that </p><p>Coalition forces protect the Romanian Embassy in Baghdad </p><p>which, according to the note, was looted on April 10.  The </p><p>Japanese Charge to Iraq also told us April 17 that the </p><p>Japanese Embassy in Baghdad has been looted within the past </p><p>week. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  In the past two days we have received numerous </p><p>similar inquiries from other diplomatic missions in Amman. </p><p>The Thais, Nigerians, Japanese, Belgians, Romanians, and </p><p>Poles have all asked us to help protect their facilities in </p><p>Baghdad, and provide them with information on the safety of </p><p>Baghdad and the road from Amman to Baghdad so they can </p><p>determine the proper time to send their diplomatic personnel </p><p>back to Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  COMMENT:  Since most missions in Baghdad supported </p><p>their Iraq operations from Amman, we anticipate a steady </p><p>stream of queries from other embassies about when it will be </p><p>safe for their people to travel to Baghdad to open or reopen </p><p>missions there.  We also anticipate further requests for </p><p>Coalition forces to protect diplomatic facilities in Baghdad. </p><p> We would appreciate any information the Department can </p><p>provide so we can respond to these queries. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
