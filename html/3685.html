<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001682 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, INR/NESA, S/CT; </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD; LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09-11-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINR, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Biographic sketches of members of Tamil Tiger </p><p>negotiating team slated to attend upcoming talks </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Para two contains brief biographic sketches of </p><p>the members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) team attending the upcoming talks with the Sri </p><p>Lankan government.  (Note:  The talks are scheduled to </p><p>take place in Thailand, September 16-18.)  The four </p><p>members of the LTTE team are:  Anton Balasingham, head </p><p>of delegation and LTTE spokesman; Adele Balasingham, </p><p>secretary for the team (she is the spouse of Anton </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Balasingham); Jay Maheswaran, a development expert; and </p><p>Viswanathan Rudrakumar, a LTTE legal adviser based in </p><p>the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Brief biographic sketches of the LTTE delegation </p><p>members follow: </p><p> </p><p>-- Anton Balasingham, age 60, is the LTTE\'s London-based </p><p>spokesman and the head of the group\'s delegation to the </p><p>Thailand talks.  He is originally from the coastal town </p><p>of Point Pedro in Jaffna.  Before becoming active in </p><p>Tamil militant politics in the early 1970s, he was a </p><p>journalist at the "Virakesari" Tamil newspaper and later </p><p>an information specialist at the British High Commission </p><p>in Colombo, where he was responsible for Tamil language </p><p>translation services, among other duties.  He has done </p><p>some post-graduate work in London and worked as a </p><p>lecturer at a university in the UK.  He holds UK </p><p>citizenship.  His first wife (a Sri Lankan Tamil) died </p><p>in the mid-1970\'s and he married Adele, a nurse from </p><p>Australia, in 1978 (see below).  Balasingham has very </p><p>serious kidney problems and is also believed to suffer </p><p>from diabetes.  He speaks excellent English, Tamil, and </p><p>Sinhalese. </p><p> </p><p>According to those who have met him, Balasingham is </p><p>intelligent and well mannered.  He is dogmatic regarding </p><p>the Tamil nationalist cause and is generally leftist in </p><p>his politics.  He seems willing to listen to the views </p><p>of others, however, and is considered up-to-date on </p><p>world events.  An experienced negotiator, he was the </p><p>head of the LTTE\'s team that negotiated with the GSL </p><p>from 1988-90.  One of the highest ranking LTTE </p><p>officials, he has long been a key and loyal adviser to </p><p>LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran.  He served as translator </p><p>during Prabhakaran\'s press conference in April 2002, </p><p>often expanding on his leader\'s generally clipped </p><p>responses. </p><p> </p><p>-- Adele Balasingham, 52, an Australian national and </p><p>nurse by profession, is Anton Balasingham\'s spouse </p><p>(marrying him in 1978; they have no children).  Her </p><p>maiden name is Wilby and her mother is believed to live </p><p>in Victoria state.  She is secretary of the LTTE team </p><p>going to Thailand.  Based on all reports, she came from </p><p>a middle class background in Australia, and became </p><p>involved in LTTE and radical politics only after her </p><p>marriage.  Adele Balasingham is considered extremely </p><p>dogmatic and inflexible regarding LTTE issues.  A </p><p>"Marxist-feminist" (to use her term), she had for years </p><p>been deeply involved in the LTTE women\'s wing.  Her key </p><p>party duty now (ironically) is serving as assistant to </p><p>her husband, who needs constant medical attention for </p><p>his kidney ailment. </p><p> </p><p>-- Dr. Jay Maheswaran, who is in his early 50\'s, is a </p><p>key figure in the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization </p><p>(TRO), a pro-LTTE development assistance organization. </p><p>He is believed to be an Australian national.  He is a </p><p>development expert and NGO activist, who often visits </p><p>Sri Lanka from his home in Australia.  He is probably </p><p>the LTTE\'s key adviser on rehabilitation/resettlement </p><p>issues.  He represented the TRO during a large demining </p><p>meeting hosted by the GSL on August 29, 2002.  U.S. </p><p>officials present at the meeting found him articulate, </p><p>apparently well-educated, and capable of presenting the </p><p>LTTE\'s views in a constructive manner.  He speaks </p><p>excellent English and Tamil. </p><p> </p><p>-- Mr. Viswanathan Rudrakumar, 45, is considered a key </p><p>adviser for the LTTE on legal issues.  He hails from </p><p>Jaffna and is the son of former Jaffna Mayor Raja </p><p>Viswanathan (who now lives in Canada).  A lawyer, he was </p><p>educated at Jaffna Central College, receiving his legal </p><p>degrees from Colombo University and Southern Methodist </p><p>University in Texas.  He also studied comparative and </p><p>constitutional law for a period at Harvard, and has </p><p>expertise in immigration law.  He now lives in the U.S. </p><p>and is apparently an American citizen.  He is probably </p><p>the LTTE\'s chief representative in the U.S., meeting </p><p>with State Department officials on a number of </p><p>occasions.  Rudrakumar was involved in initiating legal </p><p>action  against the U.S. decision to ban the LTTE in </p><p>1997, an effort that proved unsuccessful. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
