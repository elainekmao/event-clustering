(C/NF) Summary:  In a July 31 meeting, Milinda </p><p>Moragoda, a senior GSL minister, provided the Ambassador </p><p>a detailed readout of his recent talks with Anton </p><p>Balasingham, the spokesman of the Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  The atmospherics were excellent, he </p><p>related.  On substantive issues, productive discussions </p><p>were held on many topics, including the scope and timing </p><p>of proposed negotiations, and ceasefire pact </p><p>implementation.  The LTTE side also sounded out Moragoda </p><p>about the PM\'s recent visit to the U.S.  Overall, the </p><p>London meeting seems to have provided a solid foundation </p><p>for next steps in the peace process.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Meeting in London </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C/NF) In a July 31 meeting with the Ambassador, </p><p>Milinda Moragoda, a senior GSL minister, provided a </p><p>detailed readout of his July 27 talks with Anton </p><p>Balasingham, the LTTE spokesman.  The meeting took place </p><p>at the Norwegian Embassy in London.  Moragoda was the </p><p>only GSL representative present.  Balasingham and his </p><p>(Australian) wife, Adele, represented the LTTE. </p><p>Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Vidar Helgesen, </p><p>Special Envoy Erik Solheim, Norwegian Ambassador to Sri </p><p>Lanka Jon Westborg, and Norwegian MFA official Lisa </p><p>Golden were also present at the meeting as observers. </p><p>(Note:  Ref A contains Golden\'s readout of the meeting. </p><p>Her remarks track with Moragoda\'s.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Positive Atmospherics </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) Moragoda said the atmospherics of the meeting </p><p>were excellent.  The Tigers had requested the meeting </p><p>and they seemed to want to make it work.  Balasingham </p><p>gave the impression that he wanted to settle </p><p>differences.  Throughout the meeting, he seemed </p><p>"sincere, amiable, flexible."  He was much easier to </p><p>deal with and less dogmatic than Moragoda had thought he </p><p>would be.  He was even "disarming."  At one point in the </p><p>discussion, for example, Balasingham jokingly (and </p><p>accurately) used the term "extortion" in referring to </p><p>his organization\'s so-called "taxation" policies.  It </p><p>was possible, Moragoda allowed, that Balasingham was </p><p>being "duplicitous" and "putting on an act" in order to </p><p>gain some sort of advantage in the talks.  If that was </p><p>the case, Balasingham did his best to hide any such </p><p>ulterior motives. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Discussion re Proposed Talks </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C/NF) On matters of substance, the talks were quite </p><p>productive, according to Moragoda.  He noted that there </p><p>was a brief discussion of when proposed face-to-face </p><p>high-level negotiations between the GSL and the LTTE </p><p>might be held.  Moragoda\'s general impression was that </p><p>the talks might kick off at some point in September or </p><p>October, but it was still not clear and there had been </p><p>no agreement on the issue.  (Note:  The two sides have </p><p>already agreed that the venue of the proposed talks will </p><p>be Thailand.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C/NF) The two sides also discussed the scope of </p><p>possible negotiations.  Balasingham seemed intent that </p><p>the proposed talks focus primarily on the setting up of </p><p>an interim council for the north and east, as opposed to </p><p>focusing on a final settlement of the dispute.  He </p><p>specifically said the LTTE did not want "countless </p><p>lawyers" being involved in the talks.  That would only </p><p>complicate matters.  Moragoda replied that the GSL </p><p>wanted all issues to be on the table.  He also told </p><p>Balasingham, however, that it would be possible for </p><p>certain issues -- including the interim council -- to be </p><p>dealt with more quickly than other, so-called "core </p><p>issues."  Balasingham seemed relieved to hear this. </p><p>(Note:  Moragoda told the Ambassador that Ambassador </p><p>Westborg had mentioned to him the best way forward </p><p>regarding an interim administration may be to revive the </p><p>"north-east council" structure.  The council -- a </p><p>product of the 1987 Indo-Sri Lankan accord -- is no </p><p>longer active, but is already codified in the 13th </p><p>amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C/NF) In an interesting aside on the LTTE\'s long- </p><p>term objectives, Balasingham told Moragoda that the </p><p>Tigers were mulling over ideas such as "internal </p><p>autonomy, federalism and confederalism."  Moragoda </p><p>thought that this was positive in that Balasingham had </p><p>not mentioned the word "separatism."  He admitted that </p><p>he was not sure what the LTTE might mean by these terms, </p><p>however, as they were all subject to various </p><p>interpretations. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Other Issues Covered </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C/NF) Moragoda said there was also a constructive </p><p>give-and-take on a wide variety of additional subjects </p><p>related to the peace process, including: </p><p> </p><p>-- Ceasefire Accord Implementation:  Balasingham </p><p>stressed that it was important that the Sri Lankan </p><p>government adhere to the terms of the February ceasefire </p><p>accord.  He indicated that the matter was not a "deal </p><p>breaker," however -- the LTTE just wanted to see more </p><p>progress.  In particular, the Sri Lankan military had to </p><p>do a better job of vacating temples and schools.  In </p><p>addition, the LTTE was concerned about the "high </p><p>security zones," the large swaths of the north and east </p><p>currently controlled by the Sri Lankan military.  These </p><p>areas should be made smaller, so that Tamil civilians </p><p>had increased access to public lands.  Moragoda replied </p><p>that the government would look into the issue, although </p><p>the zones were technically permitted under the ceasefire </p><p>accord. </p><p> </p><p>-- Sea-related Issues:  Balasingham told Moragoda that </p><p>the LTTE was concerned that Sri Lanka Naval (SLN) </p><p>vessels were transiting too close to LTTE shore-based </p><p>positions off the Mullaitivu region on Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>northeast coast.  LTTE guns had a range of up to 10 </p><p>miles in that area.  It was important that the SLN not </p><p>spark an incident.  The LTTE had also recently purchased </p><p>trawlers in India and was using them to fish.  The GSL </p><p>should allow this activity.  Moragoda replied that the </p><p>Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) should look into </p><p>these issues; that was what the group was there for. </p><p>The issue of transit by LTTE boats was also discussed. </p><p>The LTTE had backed off its formerly hard-line stand. </p><p>It now seemed willing to accede to a compromise </p><p>formulation developed by the SLMM that would allow less </p><p>than fully armed LTTE cadre to travel via LTTE boats. </p><p>LTTE boats could also carry a specified amount of </p><p>ammunition for their fixed guns, per the SLMM proposal. </p><p> </p><p>-- LTTE Cadre Held Prisoner:  Balasingham also requested </p><p>that LTTE personnel held prisoner by the government be </p><p>released as soon as possible.  Moragoda said he would </p><p>look into the matter.  (Note:  Balasingham estimated </p><p>that the GSL held hundreds of its cadre prisoner. </p><p>Moragoda said he had been told by GSL contacts that the </p><p>number was less than a hundred.) </p><p>-- LTTE request re Banking:  On behalf of LTTE financial </p><p>chief "Thamil Enthy," Balasingham requested that the </p><p>government open up banks that would provide loans to </p><p>farmers and others living in Tiger-controlled areas. </p><p>This would help increase economic activity in the area. </p><p>Moragoda told Balasingham he would review this.  He </p><p>noted to the Ambassador that he was checking on whether </p><p>a defunct GSL-backed micro-credit bank could be revived </p><p>in order to focus on this matter. </p><p> </p><p>-- Muslim Issues:  Balasingham complained that Sri Lanka </p><p>Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader Rauf Hakeem had been asked </p><p>by the LTTE to keep in touch with LTTE eastern commander </p><p>Karuna.  Hakeem, however, continued to demand that his </p><p>only LTTE interlocutor be the group\'s leader, V. </p><p>Prabhakaran.  This was a problem and was leading to a </p><p>breakdown in LTTE-SLMC relations.  In fact, the LTTE was </p><p>increasingly avoiding the SLMC altogether and dealing </p><p>directly with other Muslim groups. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Query re U.S. Visit </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C/NF) The LTTE side also wanted to know about Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe\'s July 21-25 visit to the U.S., </p><p>with Adele Balasingham specifically asking about the </p><p>PM\'s meeting with President Bush.  Moragoda replied that </p><p>President Bush had given the PM his full vote of </p><p>confidence and had expressed support for a negotiated </p><p>solution of the conflict.  (Anton) Balasingham commented </p><p>that this was fine with the LTTE, as the group </p><p>understood that the U.S. and India had key roles to play </p><p>in the peace process.   Moragoda briefly mentioned U.S. </p><p>assistance on military matters, commenting that a more </p><p>secure Sri Lankan military would only benefit the peace </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Balasingham\'s Schedule </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C/NF) The London meeting wrapped up with a brief </p><p>discussion of Balasingham\'s schedule.  Balasingham said </p><p>he would be in London until mid-August (apparently his </p><p>mother-in-law was in town).  He planned to travel to </p><p>Oslo around August 15 to give a speech.  He wanted to </p><p>travel to Canada at some point, too, but it was not </p><p>clear whether the Canadian government would permit him </p><p>to visit.  Around August 20, he planned to travel to Sri </p><p>Lanka to visit the LTTE leadership in the north. </p><p>Balasingham noted that in doing this he would like to </p><p>transit India, but it was not clear whether India would </p><p>allow him in the country.  (Note:  The Indian government </p><p>has previously given Balasingham a firm "no" in reply to </p><p>his pleas to enter the country.)  Adele Balasingham </p><p>noted that her husband\'s health was poor and that India </p><p>should be helpful and offer him medical treatment if he </p><p>needed it while in northern Sri Lanka.  (Note:  India </p><p>has said no to this before, too.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C/NF) Moragoda told the Ambassador that he had </p><p>invited Balasingham to transit Colombo on his way to the </p><p>north, but Balasingham had turned down the offer, saying </p><p>"not at this time."  Moragoda added that he had heard </p><p>from the Norwegian side that Helgesen might make a trip </p><p>to Sri Lanka in late August, around the same time as </p><p>Balasingham\'s planned trip. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C/NF) Overall, the London meeting seems to have </p><p>provided a solid foundation for next steps in the peace </p><p>process.  Moragoda, for one, appeared confident that the </p><p>talks had gone well.  That said, he made clear that he </p><p>did not want to make too much of the meeting and that he </p><p>remained cautious, given the difficulty of reading the </p><p>LTTE\'s true intentions.  Certainly, the meeting -- the </p><p>highest-level GSL-LTTE contact in years -- was an </p><p>important benchmark.  The notion of high-level </p><p>representatives of the GSL and the LTTE discussing </p><p>issues face-to-face in a productive give-and-take is a </p><p>new and positive development.  In addition, the fact </p><p>that the talks took place at all was important for the </p><p>GSL in underscoring to Sri Lankans that its peace </p><p>initiative still maintains traction and is not sliding </p><p>backwards.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
