(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a 19 February meeting with the Ambassador, </p><p>MFA Asst U/S Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuaimi provided a candid </p><p>readout on the Arab League Extraordinary Ministerial held </p><p>in Cairo 15-16 February.  Noting that he attended because </p><p>he thought it would be a "good show", Al-Nuaimi commented </p><p>that there was much disagreement at the Ministerial, which </p><p>ended in frustration for most attendees. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Al-Nuaimi stated that it became quickly apparent </p><p>there was no consensus on Iraq and the Ministers did not </p><p>intend to issue a statement at the conclusion of the </p><p>Ministerial.  In the end it was pushed through by some, </p><p>namely Syria with Lebanon for cover in the President\'s </p><p>chair.  The UAEG official commented that attendees allowed </p><p>the statement\'s issuance, even though it did not reflect </p><p>the opinion of the majority, because given the deep </p><p>divisions "it\'s just a paper and doesn\'t mean much."  Al- </p><p>Nuaimi continued that "We all want a unified Arab position, </p><p>but one that is realistic and not just rhetoric to be </p><p>written in the newspapers.  Now is not the time for such </p><p>rhetoric!"  Al-Nuaimi added that he doubted very much a </p><p>Summit would be held at the end of the month.  "There was </p><p>total disagreement at the Ministerial level, why embarrass </p><p>the Heads of State?" </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
