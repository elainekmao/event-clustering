<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002974 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR FRAZIER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/23/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MOPS, PGOV, CG, RW, UG, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER KINGIBE SEES A </p><p>CRITICAL PERIOD IN THE CONGOLESE PEACE PROCESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary: During a November 4 encounter, former </p><p>Foreign Minister and informal peace process advisor Baba Gana </p><p>Kingibe told Polcouns that last month\'s Inter-Congolese </p><p>Dialogue (ICD) derailed primarily because of Kabila </p><p>government duplicity.  The next ICD would not take place </p><p>until January. Kingibe worried that, during the interregnum, </p><p>the Congolese rivals would spend too much time flexing their </p><p>muscles and seeking military advantage.  Kingibe claimed </p><p>Kagame and Museveni were malefactors in this process, </p><p>contributing not only to the martial air in the Congo, but </p><p>inching closer to an imprudent collision themselves.  Kingibe </p><p>believed it incumbent on Nigeria, the U.S. and other nations </p><p>to pressure Kabila, the major faction leaders, Kagame and </p><p>Museveni to focus attention on the issues of peace instead of </p><p>grasping for balance of power advantages on the ground.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Inter-Congolese Dialogue - A Stalling Game </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The October Inter-Congolese Dialogue in Addis was </p><p>handicapped by several factors, Kingibe noted. Lack of </p><p>funding was a problem.  Western donors pledged money but </p><p>actual funding was late or did not come at all.  This </p><p>short-fall inhibited the ability to pay for the travel and </p><p>lodging of all participants; because of the funding gap, the </p><p>conference got off to a bad start and could never regain </p><p>momentum.  African mediators, nonetheless, pushed the </p><p>conference forward, fearing that delay would send the wrong </p><p>signal to the international community and undermine donor </p><p>confidence in the peace process.  Kingibe also felt that </p><p>Masire had not done sufficient preparatory work with the </p><p>major Congolese participants to make sure the conference </p><p>would yield results. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Despite these problems, the conference might have </p><p>succeeded but for Kabila government duplicity.  During </p><p>earlier stages of conference planning, Kinshasa wanted a </p><p>truncated ICD, gathering only the major faction leaders and a </p><p>few prominent representatives from civil society.  At the </p><p>eleventh hour, however, Kabila\'s people did an abrupt </p><p>volte-face.  The DROC security chief, who headed the </p><p>delegation, insisted that the Addis session only deal with </p><p>procedural or technical issues since all Congolese groups, </p><p>large and small, were not present.  The Kabila team argued </p><p>that substantive discussions would be futile during an </p><p>abbreviated session, since the participants would have to </p><p>rehash the same issues once a more inclusive ICD took place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  By the time more participants arrived, the Kabila </p><p>team simply began to stonewall, according to Kingibe.  Their </p><p>change on the conference make-up was a willful dilatory </p><p>tactic.  Kinshasa had asked them to stall because it was </p><p>expecting a large shipment of military equipment (helicopters </p><p>from France and weapons from China.)  Kabila planned to arm </p><p>the Mai Mai "to the teeth" and dangle the promise of weapons </p><p>in front of factional warlord Mbusa, Kingibe stated.  Once </p><p>the team in Addis received word the equipment had arrived, </p><p>they closed their briefcases and essentially deep-sixed the </p><p>ICD.  The Kabila team believed the new arms would shift the </p><p>power balance, opening the door for them to win by force </p><p>concessions they could not then obtain at the negotiating </p><p>table. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>The Game of Shifting Alliances </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Kingibe rued the unsatisfactory ending of the ICD. </p><p>While some talked of holding the next session in November, </p><p>Masire told him that time was required to pick up the pieces. </p><p> Masire did not contemplate another meeting until January, </p><p>particularly since that session had to be universal in </p><p>attendance.  While the Facilitator would be slogging through </p><p>the tedium of conference planning, the Congolese factions </p><p>would be counting their weapons and looking to acquire more </p><p>real estate to exchange for more favorable political </p><p>concessions later, Kingibe predicted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  While all the parties agreed that Kabila could remain </p><p>as a caretaker President, they also wanted to maximize their </p><p>positions in the interim government and, thus, situate </p><p>themselves for subsequent elections.  Waxing philosophical, </p><p>Kingibe said that "Where you are in the afternoon, and how </p><p>fast you travel, will dictate where you rest in the evening. </p><p>Ultimately, all the faction leaders wanted to rest in the </p><p>biggest bed in the Presidential palace."  Kingibe lamented </p><p>that the power-oriented focus of the Congolese leaders might </p><p>far outweigh Masire\'s ability to push the peace process by </p><p>himself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Adding Nigeria\'s confirmation to what we have </p><p>learned,  Kingibe stated that Kabila and Museveni had struck </p><p>a deal, rendering Kagame the odd-man-out.  The deal was good </p><p>for Kabila because it lessened the heat from Kampala.  As a </p><p>by-product of the deal and of recent arms shipments, Kabila </p><p>resupplied the Mai Mai.  Kabila and Museveni were also </p><p>enticing Mbusa.  Meanwhile, Kagame has not been sitting idle </p><p>himself.  He has brought Bemba\'s MLC and Onusumba\'s RDC-G </p><p>closer to him.  He too is courting Mbusa, who, according to </p><p>Kingbe, is relishing his "nonaligned" role and concomitant </p><p>ability to pit both sides in a bidding war for his hand in a </p><p>marriage of convenience. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Meddling Neighbors </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Kingibe chastised Kagame and, to a greater extent, </p><p>Museveni for the irksome role they are playing in the Congo. </p><p>Kingibe thought Kagame\'s intervention was more understandable </p><p>than Museveni\'s, given the presence of the FAR and </p><p>Interahamwe and the tragedy that was Rwanda a few years ago. </p><p>Museveni, on the other hand, had let the scope of his </p><p>ambition exceed his sense of proportion and Uganda\'s national </p><p>interests.  Moreover, several Ugandan generals were profiting </p><p>from illicit trafficking in Eastern Congo.  These mercantile </p><p>officers encouraged Museveni\'s over-extension in the Congo to </p><p>perpetuate their enrichment, Kingibe offered.  On a lesser </p><p>level, Zimbabwe still remained engaged despite its internal </p><p>woes.  Kabila\'s Justice Minister, Kingibe pointed out, was </p><p>close to several Zimbabwean leaders, including Mugabe. </p><p>Because these Zimbabweans were making money in the Congo, </p><p>they would come to the aid of Kabila, politically and even </p><p>militarily, to the extent they could.  Kingibe dismissed </p><p>Angola as progressi </p><p>vely disinterested and dwindling in importance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Raising the Problem of Peace </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Kingibe believed that preventing major slippage in </p><p>the peace process during the IDC hiatus would require skilled </p><p>diplomacy.  While not costing much materially, nations </p><p>claiming to support the Congolese peace process must </p><p>demonstrate political will at this time.  Given the major </p><p>actors\' proclivity for military diversions, he contended a </p><p>sustained diplomatic effort was needed to keep the issues of </p><p>peace on the front burner and to prevent the Congolese actors </p><p>from tinkering too heavily with the balance of power on the </p><p>ground.  Every hour you force them to discuss peace is one </p><p>less hour they can play at war, Kingibe declared.  Kingibe\'s </p><p>strategy included: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Pressuring Kagame and Museveni to play more positive roles </p><p>and not use the Congo as a proxy for bilateral power plays. </p><p>They must discourage the armed groups within their spheres of </p><p>influence from an escalation of hostilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Urging Masire to travel the region to discuss with all key </p><p>players the issues for the next ICD and solicit their views. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Encourage the Zambian government to hold a senior-level </p><p>conference in December to review progress on implementing the </p><p>Lusaka Accord. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Kingibe thought these efforts would help moderate the players </p><p>while filling in time until the ICP could resume.  Kingibe </p><p>also felt the USG could best use its diplomatic weight to </p><p>encourage Museveni and Kagame to behave better.  For its </p><p>part, Nigeria was arranging a meeting in Abuja of the Kabila, </p><p>Bemba, Onusumba trio as soon as their travel schedules </p><p>coincide. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Kingibe confirmed, from the Nigerian perspective, </p><p>much of what we already knew.  It is helpful to know that </p><p>Abuja views events in the Congo much the same as we do. </p><p>Kingbe\'s assessment that the ICD hiatus might invite a period </p><p>of heightened adventurism bears attention.  Some diplomatic </p><p>pressure at this juncture may be worthwhile to prevent a </p><p>slide in the peace process.  End comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
