END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>SHARED TRI-MISSION GOALS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) THE PRINCIPAL GOALS OF THE TRI-MISSION </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY WORKING GROUP ARE TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND TO PROMOTE </p><p>THE TECHNOLOGY AS A USEFUL TOOL IN ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT IN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  FOR THE </p><p>BILATERAL MISSION, WE HAVE ANALYZED THE GOI POLITICAL STAKES, </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR PROGRESS, AND SUGGESTED DEPARTMENT ACTION IN 02 </p><p>ROME 6137.  THIS MESSAGE ACCORDINGLY FOCUSES ON FURTHERING </p><p>THESE GOALS WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. </p><p> </p><p>SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) FODAG AND EMBASSY VATICAN LEAD THE ROME EFFORT TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN THE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF BIOTECHNOLOGY AND </p><p>ITS POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  THE DIRECT VOICES </p><p>OF SCIENTISTS AND LEADERS FROM THE DEVELOPING WORLD ARE VITAL </p><p>IN HELPING TO PERSUADE A SKEPTICAL CATHOLIC CHURCH THAT </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY REPRESENTS PART OF THE PATHWAY TO A BETTER LIFE </p><p>IN SOME OF THE WORLD\'S POOREST AND HUNGRIEST COUNTRIES.  OUR </p><p>AIM IS TO HAVE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PLAY A POSITIVE/PROACTIVE </p><p>ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY ON BEHALF OF THE </p><p>DEVELOPING WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) IS </p><p>RESPECTED AS A NEUTRAL, SCIENCE-BASED SOURCE OF INFORMATION </p><p>ON AGRICULTURE AND HAS CREDIBILITY THAT NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS </p><p>OR THE PRIVATE SECTOR MAY LACK.  THE FAO\'S FIELD PRESENCE IN </p><p>MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES GIVES IT AN ENORMOUS POTENTIAL FOR </p><p>OUTREACH.  FURTHERMORE, MOST OF THE FAO\'S MEMBER NATIONS </p><p>MAINTAIN PERMANENT MISSIONS IN ROME, MANY OF WHICH ARE </p><p>STAFFED WITH OFFICIALS WITH EXPERTISE IN AGRICULTURE AND/OR </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.   HOWEVER, FAO HAS NOT FULFILLED ITS </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE ITS MEMBER NATIONS STAKEHOLDERS </p><p>WITH ACCURATE AND UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p> </p><p>ACTION STR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   EVG-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00   E-00     FAAE-00  UTED-00 </p><p>      VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   NASA-01  AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OES-00   OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   OPIC-01  PER-00   PM-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00   DRL-01   G-00     SAS-00     /011W </p><p></p><p>P 071555Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8141 </p><p>USDA FAS WASHDC 2524 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY MEXICO </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION UNVIE VIENNA </p><p></p></div>
