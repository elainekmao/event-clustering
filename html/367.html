<p>S E C R E T BAGHDAD 03340 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PINS, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: COUP RUMORS: IRAQI EXILES AND IRAN FABRICATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 187203, (B) FBIS LD0106133190, </p><p>(C) KUWAIT 3083 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  A NUMBER OF RUMORS ARE CIRCULATING IN </p><p>THE REGION ABOUT RECENT ABORTIVE COUP ATTEMPTS. </p><p>THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE RUMORS ARE NOT FRIENDS </p><p>OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT.  FOR EXAMPLE: </p><p> </p><p>--AL TAYYAR AL-JADID (IRAQI SHI\'A OPPOSITION </p><p>PAMPHLET IN LONDON): ARRESTS IN MAY OF "HUNDREDS" </p><p>OF ARMY OFFICERS AND CIVILIANS, INCLUDING </p><p>SADDAM\'S ADVISOR AND RELATIVE, FADIL BARRAK </p><p>(FORMER HEAD OF IRAQI CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE); </p><p> </p><p>--TEHRAN DOMESTIC SERVICE: 17 PILOTS EXECUTED </p><p>IN EARLY APRIL; </p><p> </p><p>--TURCOMAN (TURKISH PUBLICATION, PRESUMABLY </p><p>BY TURKOMANS):  ARRESTS AND EXECUTIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING OF A GENERAL OFFICER NAMED DHIA </p><p>AL-KAN\'AN (THERE IS A TURCOMAN FAMILY OF THAT </p><p>NAME IN KIRKUK). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  DESPITE THE OBVIOUSLY SUSPECT PROVENANCE </p><p>OF THESE ASSERTIONS, WISHFUL THINKING BY </p><p>ANTI-SADDAM GROUPS GIVE SUCH STORIES MORE </p><p>CURRENCY THAN THEY DESERVE.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>EMBASSY KUWAIT REPORTS THAT THE INTELLIGENT </p><p>AND SENSIBLE KUWAITI MINISTER OF OIL HAS TOLD </p><p>TWO RECENT AMERICAN VISITORS THAT SADDAM\'S NEW, </p><p>TOUGH PUBLIC POSTURING ON FOREIGN POLICY MAY BE </p><p>A REACTION TO "INTERNAL PRESSURES AND </p><p>INSTABILITY OF HIS REGIME."  IN THIS, SHAYKH ALI, </p><p>WE BELIEVE, IS ENTIRELY WRONG.  THE KUWAITI </p><p>AMBASSADOR HERE SHARES OUR ASSESSMENT THAT SADDAM </p><p>IS DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, BUT THESE DO </p><p>NOT INCLUDE ANY SPECIAL OR NEW CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>COUP PLOTTING. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THERE ARE </p><p>NOT OCCASIONAL "DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS" HERE. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRESIDENT\'S LONG-TIME KURDISH </p><p>ADC, SABAH MIRZA, UNDOUBTEDLY BLOTTED HIS COPY </p><p>BOOK THIS YEAR.  HE WAS ARRESTED AND MAY BE </p><p>DEAD.  NOR ARE WE SUGGESTING THAT AN ABORTIVE </p><p>COUP WOULD NECESSARILY BE DETECTED BY WESTERN </p><p>EMBASSIES HERE.  WE DO NOT, HOWEVER, HAVE ANY </p><p>EVIDENCE OF A GROUND SWELL OF ACTIVE ANTI-SADDAM </p><p>SENTIMENT OR ACTIVITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  FURTHER, SADDAM IS WORKING HARD TO </p><p>DO WHAT HE CAN TO RELIEVE HIS NEED TO DEPEND </p><p>ENTIRELY ON HIS VERY EFFECTIVE SECRET SERVICES. </p><p>CURRENT EXAMPLES ARE HIS HIGHLY PUBLICIZED </p><p>AND PERSONAL WORK ON REVIEW OF THE DRAFT </p><p>CONSTITUTION AND HIS TIRELESS WALKABOUTS </p><p>IN OBSCURE VILLAGES AND MAJOR TOWNS TO INSPECT </p><p>AND IMPROVE CITIZENS\' WELFARE. THE PARTY </p><p>HAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT THOUSANDS </p><p>OF CHEERING ARAB (NOT KURDISH) IRAQIS TO </p><p>GREET THEIR PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  FINALLY, WE INVITE ATTENTION TO </p><p>UNEVALUATED INTELLIGENCE ON THESE ISSUES. </p><p>A GOODS-OR BAD-- EXAMPLE IS IIR 2 762 0096 90 </p><p>(CDRUSAOPSGP), WHICH HAS BARRAK  ARRESTED </p><p>AND DEAD IN 1989, A PERIOD WHEN HIS PICTURE </p><p>APPEARED IN THE PRESS WITH SADDAM AND MORE THAN </p><p>ONE AMERICAN HAD LUNCH WITH HIM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p></p></div>
