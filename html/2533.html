SUMMARY: ITALYS TRANSITION TO THE EURO WENT </p><p>SMOOTHLY, WITH A FEW SNAGS  PRINCIPALLY IN THE SOUTH. </p><p>ITALIANS STOPPED USING LIRE ON FEBRUARY 28, ALTHOUGH </p><p>BANKS, AT THE REQUEST OF THE BANK OF ITALY, HAVE </p><p>EXTENDED THE DEADLINE FOR EXCHANGING LIRE FOR EUROS </p><p>UNTIL JUNE 30. OPINIONS ARE MIXED ABOUT THE </p><p>INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE CHANGEOVER. OFFICIAL DATA </p><p>SHOW A MODEST IMPACT, WHILE CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS </p><p>ARGUE THAT THE INFLATIONARY EFFECT WAS FAR HIGHER, BUT </p><p>T </p><p>NOT CAPTURED BY OFFICIAL STATISTICS. ITALYS FIRST </p><p>COUNTERFEIT EUROS HAVE BEEN FOUND. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A LONG CHANGEOVER </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE ITALIAN EURO CHANGEOVER PERIOD WAS ONE OF THE </p><p>LONGEST AMONG THE 12 EU COUNTRIES THAT ADOPTED THE NEW </p><p>CURRENCY.  GERMANY, NETHERLANDS, IRELAND AND FRANCE </p><p>ALREADY FINISHED THEIR CHANGEOVER.  ITALY WAS TO HAVE </p><p>FINISHED BY FEBRUARY 28, BUT, AT THE REQUEST OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL BANK, THE ITALIAN BANKING ASSOCIATION EXTENDED </p><p>THE CHANGEOVER PERIOD FOR FOUR ADDITIONAL MONTHS UNTIL </p><p>THE END OF JUNE. THE EURO WILL BE THE ONLY LEGAL </p><p>CURRENCY IN ITALY STARTING MARCH 1, BUT CUSTOMERS MAY </p><p>CHANGE LIRE INTO EURO, FREE OF CHARGE, AT BANKS UNTIL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01059  01 OF 04  281501Z </p><p>JUNE 30.  THERE WILL BE SOME CONDITIONS: THE MAXIMUM </p><p>ALLOWED PER EXCHANGE WILL BE 1,000,000 LIRE (516 EURO) </p><p>PER DAY FOR CHECKING ACCOUNT HOLDERS BUT ONLY 500,000 </p><p>(258 EURO) DAILY FOR OTHER CUSTOMERS.  LARGER </p><p>TRANSACTIONS WILL REQUIRE MORE NOTICE.  POST OFFICES, </p><p>WHICH ACCEPT CURRENCY PAYMENTS FOR UTILITIES, SAVINGS </p><p>PLANS, ETC., ARE CONSIDERING EXTENDING THE CHANGEOVER </p><p>PERIOD. AFTER MID-JUNE, CUSTOMERS MAY STILL CHANGE </p><p>LIRE INTO EUROS AT BANK OF ITALY BRANCHES UNTIL </p><p>FEBRUARY 2012, FREE OF CHARGE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ITALY IS NOT THE ONLY COUNTRY OF THE EURO-ZONE </p><p>THAT HAS EXTENDED THE CHANGEOVER PERIOD FOR BANKS. </p><p>BANKS IN FRANCE, LUXEMBOURG, PORTUGAL, AND SPAIN WILL </p><p>EXCHANGE NATIONAL CURRENCY FOR EUROS, FREE OF CHARGES, </p><p>UNTIL END-JUNE.  ANOTHER FOUR COUNTRIES (AUSTRIA, </p><p>FINLAND, GREECE AND IRELAND) ARE DISCUSSING A POSSIBLE </p><p>EXTENSION.  IN THE NETHERLANDS, EXCHANGE WILL BE </p><p>POSSIBLE UNTIL THE END OF 2002. </p><p> </p><p>CHANGEOVER DATA </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE ITALIAN CHANGEOVER WENT SMOOTHLY, BUT THERE </p><p>ARE STILL LIRE BANKNOTE CIRCULATING, NOTICEABLY IN </p><p>SUPERMARKETS, SHOPPING CENTERS, MALLS AND RESTAURANTS. </p><p>THE OVERALL VALUE OF LIRE CIRCULATING IN ITALY AT THE </p><p>END OF 2001 WAS 120 TRILLION LIRE, EQUIVALENT TO 62 </p><p>BILLION EURO. ACCORDING TO THE BANK OF ITALY, MORE </p><p>THAN 1.6 BILLION LIRE BANKNOTE HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN </p><p>FROM CIRCULATION, VALUED AT ABOUT 90 TRILLION LIRE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01059  01 OF 04  281501Z </p><p>(46.5 BILLION EURO).  THERE ARE REMAINING 30 TRILLION </p><p>LIRE (15.5 BILLION EURO) OR 25 PERCENT OF LIRE VALUE </p><p>STILL IN CIRCULATION. MOST LARGE LIRE BANKNOTES HAVE </p><p>BEEN EXCHANGED FOR EUROS. DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF THE </p><p>CHANGEOVER, 1.5 BILLION LIRE IN BANKNOTES ARE EXPECTED </p><p>TO REMAIN IN CIRCULATION AFTER FEBRUARY 28, MOSTLY IN </p><p>SMALL DENOMINATIONS.  THE EXTENSION OF THE LIRA/EURO </p><p>EXCHANGE DEADLINE IS EXPECTED TO HELP SMALL </p><p>SHOPKEEPERS, THE ELDERLY AND OTHER GROUPS THAT HAVE </p><p>BEEN SLOW TO ACCEPT THE EURO CHANGEOVER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ACCORDING TO THE ITALIAN BANKING ASSOCIATION, </p><p>DURING THE CHANGEOVER, ITALIAN BANKS HAVE WITHDRAWN </p><p>100 TRILLION LIRE (51.6 BILLION EURO) SO FAR AND ARE </p><p>EXPECTED TO WITHDRAW ANOTHER 110 TRILLION (56.8 </p><p>BILLION EURO) BY THE END OF FEBRUARY. (COMMENT: THE </p><p>DATA REFER TO LIQUIDITY CONVERTED FROM LIRE TO EURO SO </p><p>FAR, WITH NO IMPACT ON OVERALL LIQUIDITY.) </p><p> </p><p>ONE- AND TWO-CENT COINS DEBATE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.

BUT THE MINISTER, WHO WAS </p><p>CRITICIZED AS A EURO-SKEPTIC IN THE WAKE OF HIS COOL </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW SINGLE </p><p>CURRENCY, STRESSED THAT SUCH DECISIONS SHOULD NOT BE </p><p>UNILATERAL. CALLS FOR SUCH A PRACTICE ARE GAINING </p><p>MOMENTUM IN ITALY.  THE MAYOR OF THE NORTHEASTERN CITY </p><p>OF TREVISO, GIANCARLO GENTILINI, SAID THAT HE HAD </p><p>WRITTEN TO TREMONTI URGING THE ELIMINATION OF THE </p><p>COINS.  GENTILINI SAID HE HAD HAD NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS </p><p>FROM CITIZENS EXASPERATED BY THESE TWO MICROSCOPIC </p><p>COINS.  OUR WALLETS ARE ALREADY STUFFED TO </p><p>OVERFLOWING WITH THE BIGGER COINS.  THE CENTS WERE </p><p>FINE BEFORE WORLD WAR II, WHEN MANY PEOPLE DIED </p><p>OPLE DIED </p><p>WITHOUT EVER TASTING THE JOY OF HANDLING A THOUSAND </p><p>LIRE BANKNOTE. </p><p> </p><p>7. GIANCARLO DEL BUFALO, OF THE EURO COMMITTEE OF THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE, DEFENDED THE EURO- </p><p>CENTS, WHICH ALLOWED A MORE PRECISE CONVERSION OF LIRE </p><p>PRICES INTO EURO PRICES.  ECHOING THE OPINION OF </p><p>FINANCE MINISTRY UNDERSECRETARY VITO TANZI, DEL BUFALO </p><p>SAID THE MARKET WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE ARBITRATOR OF </p><p>THE TYPE OF COINS USED. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01059  02 OF 04  281502Z </p><p>PUBLIC OPINION </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. ACCORDING TO A MID-FEBRUARY SURVEY BY THE UNION OF </p><p>ITALIAN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND THE POLLING COMPANY </p><p>TAGLIACARNE INSTITUTE, THE CHANGEOVER WAS SMOOTH. THE </p><p>SUPPLY OF EUROS IN BANK CHANNELS WAS SUFFICIENT IN </p><p>MOST CASES: ONLY 17 PERCENT OF THOSE POLLED HAD </p><p>PROBLEMS WITH OBTAINING EUROS AT BANKS. POST OFFICES </p><p>DID EVEN BETTER: ONLY 11 PERCENT OF THOSE POLLED HAD </p><p>PROBLEMS OBTAINING EUROS AT POST OFFICES.  WITH </p><p>RESPECT TO PRICE HIKES, 37 PERCENT SAID THAT EURO </p><p>PRICES FOR GOODS AND SERVICES HAD INCREASED FROM THE </p><p>LIRE PRICES. (THIS CONTRASTS WITH A MUCH GREATER </p><p>NUMBER -- 55 PERCENT OF THOSE SURVEYED  WHO SAID IN </p><p>JANUARY THAT EURO PRICES WERE HIGHER.) THE POLL SHOWED </p><p>A LARGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN ITALY </p><p>IN TERMS OF EURO SUPPLY AND PRICE INCREASES.  FORTY- </p><p>ONE PERCENT OF THOSE SURVEYED IN THE SOUTH SAID THEY </p><p>HAD SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES AT THE POST OFFICE, WHILE </p><p>ANOTHER 32 PERCENT SIGNALED THE SAME DIFFICULTIES AT </p><p>BANKS.  SEVENTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE SURVEYED </p><p>IN THE SOUTH LAMENTED UNJUSTIFIED PRICE INCREASES. </p><p> </p><p>9. IN THE SOUTH, LONG LINES AT BANKS AND POST OFFICES </p><p>PERSISTED THROUGH THE END OF JANUARY.  EVEN AS THE </p><p>FEBRUARY 28 DEADLINE APPROACHED, MANY TRANSACTIONS IN </p><p>SMALL SHOPS WERE STILL BEING CARRIED OUT IN LIRE. </p><p>TAXIMETERS, WHICH HAD BEEN CONVERTED TO EUROS IN ROME </p><p>SOON AFTER THE NEW YEAR, STILL SHOWED PRICES IN LIRE </p><p>IN NAPLES AS RECENTLY AS LATE FEBRUARY.  SHOPKEEPERS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01059  02 OF 04  281502Z </p><p>IN NAPLES FREQUENTLY HAVE PROBLEMS MAKING CHANGE, AS </p><p>MOST CASH DRAWERS CONTAIN FAR MORE LIRE THAN EUROS. </p><p>DESPITE THE INITIAL CONFUSION, AND THE CONTINUING </p><p>RESISTANCE TO THE NEW CURRENCY, BANCO DI NAPOLI </p><p>OFFICIALS MINIMIZED THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CHANGEOVER </p><p>IN THE SOUTH.  THEY BELIEVE THAT THE PROCESS OF </p><p>ADAPTATION WILL ACCELERATE QUICKLY ONCE THE LIRA LOSES </p><p>ITS VALUE AS LEGAL TENDER. </p><p> </p><p>INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE CHANGEOVER </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT, IN SEVERAL SECTORS, </p><p>PRICES WERE ROUNDED UP TO FACILITATE THE EURO </p><p>CONVERSION.  ONLY AFTER FIRST QUARTER RESULTS ARE IN </p><p>WILL A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE BE POSSIBLE.  OFFICIAL </p><p>STATISTICS INDICATE A 0.5 PERCENT INCREASE IN PRICES </p><p>FROM THE PREVIOUS MONTH BOTH IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY. </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, PRICE FIGURES FROM TWENTY ITALIAN </p><p>CITIES, RELEASED ON FEBRUARY 21, INDICATE THAT THE </p><p>YEAR-TO-YEAR INFLATION RATE INCREASED FROM 2.4 PERCENT </p><p>IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY TO 2.5 PERCENT IN FEBRUARY. </p><p>CENTRAL BANK CONTACTS SAY A 0.7 PERCENT INCREASE IN </p><p>INFLATION IS LIKELY IN THE FIRST QUARTER BECAUSE OF </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1827 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01059  03 OF 04  281502Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  E-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PC-01    ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  USIE-00  FMP-00   SNIS-00  NISC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------6D4A41  281502Z /38 </p><p>R 281430Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 2492 </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 001059 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA </p><p>DEPT PASS TREAS FOR OASIA HARLOW, JONES </p><p>STATE PASS FRB FOR GUST </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, IT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01059  03 OF 04  281502Z </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE EURO CHANGEOVER IN ITALY </p><p> </p><p>THIS ROUNDING UP. THIS INCREASE WILL NOT BE EASILY </p><p>ABSORBED DURING THE YEAR AND COULD PUSH THE YEARLY </p><p>AVERAGE INFLATION RATE CLOSE TO TWO PERCENT.   THERE </p><p>WAS SOME ROUNDING DOWN AS WELL, WHICH COMPENSATED FOR </p><p>A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE ROUNDING UP. </p><p> </p><p>11. THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT OF ITALYS LARGEST </p><p>INDUSTRIAL ASSOCIATION, CONFINDUSTRIA, CONSIDERS THE </p><p>ACCELERATION OF INFLATION A TEMPORARY EFFECT OF THE </p><p>CHANGEOVER, AND BELIEVES THAT THE DECELERATION WILL </p><p>START IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS.  HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF </p><p>THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 2002, THE CONFINDUSTRIA </p><p>ESTIMATE OF AN INFLATION RATE OF 1.5 PERCENT IN 2002 </p><p>HAS HAD TO BE REVISED UPWARD TO ABOUT 2.0 PERCENT. </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE AND THE MINISTRY </p><p>OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES CONTINUE TO TRUST IN THE </p><p>ANTI-INFLATIONARY MECHANISMS SET UP BY THE GOI, AND </p><p>PREDICT THAT THE CHANGEOVER WILL HAVE ONLY A MODEST </p><p>INFLATIONARY IMPACT.  OTHER GOI CONTACTS PREDICT THAT </p><p>ADDITIONAL PRICE INCREASES MAY OCCUR ON MARCH 1, WHEN </p><p>THE LIRA IS TAKEN OUT OF CIRCULATION.  CARLO RIENZI, </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE LEADING CONSUMER ASSOCIATION, </p><p>CODACONS, FORESEES SUBSTANTIAL PRICE INCREASES </p><p>STARTING MARCH 1, WHEN LIRE PRICES WILL NO LONGER BE </p><p>POSTED FOR COMPARISON. FROM THAT DAY, JUNGLE LAW WILL </p><p>PREVAIL, RIENZI SAID. </p><p> </p><p>12. THE CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS, ADICONSUM, CODACONS AND </p><p>UNIONE CONSUMATORI, SAY THAT THE INFLATIONARY IMPACT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01059  03 OF 04  281502Z </p><p>IS HIGHER THAN THE GOI HAS REPORTED. THESE </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS PLAN TO APPEAL TO ISTAT, THE CENTRAL </p><p>INSTITUTE OF STATISTICS, WHICH IS IN CHARGE OF THE </p><p>CALCULATION AND THE PUBLICATION OF THE PRICE DATA, </p><p>REQUESTING THE COMPOSITION OF THE NEW INDEX AND THE </p><p>METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION OF PRICE INCREASES. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATIONS, THE JANUARY DATA DO NOT </p><p>MEASURE THE REAL INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE EURO </p><p>CHANGEOVER, WHICH, THEY SAY, MAY EQUAL AN AVERAGE </p><p>INFLATION OF THREE PERCENT THIS YEAR.  THE </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS ESTIMATE THAT PRICES WILL INCREASE BY 14 </p><p>PERCENT IN 2002 ON AVERAGE, WITH A LOSS OF PURCHASING </p><p>POWER OF 557.77 EURO (USD 490) A YEAR PER HOUSEHOLD, </p><p>, </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 40 TO 50 EURO PER MONTH.  THE CONSUMER </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS RECENTLY PUBLISHED A PAMPHLET </p><p>HIGHLIGHTING PRICE INCREASES.  HIGHWAY TOLLS ROSE BY </p><p>2.21 PERCENT, NATIONAL TELEVISION FEES BY 1.46 </p><p>PERCENT, LOTTERY TICKET PRICES BY 16 PERCENT FROM </p><p>5,000 LIRE (EURO 2.58) TO THREE EUROS.  IN MILAN, </p><p>PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TICKETS INCREASED BY 29.1 </p><p>PERCENT, FROM 1,500 LIRE (EURO 0.77) TO ONE EURO. </p><p> </p><p>MONEY-LAUNDERING AND COUNTERFEITING </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. THE EURO HAS BLACK-MARKET BENEFITS THAT THE DOLLAR </p><p>CANNOT MATCH.  THE SINGLE CURRENCY GLIDES WITHOUT A </p><p>TRACE ACROSS A NEWLY BORDER-LESS EUROPE IN BILLS </p><p>DENOMINATED IN LARGE VALUES SCARCELY SEEN IN THE </p><p>REGION.

WHETHER </p><p>MEASURED BY WEIGHT OR VOLUME, THIS MEANS MORE EUROS </p><p>CAN BE JAMMED INTO A BRIEFCASE THAN DOLLARS OR OLD </p><p>EUROPEAN CURRENCIES. ACCORDING TO THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>ECONOMY AND FINANCE, THE ARRIVAL OF THE EURO </p><p>INCREASED THE RISKS OF MONEY-LAUNDERING.  THE PERIOD </p><p>OF DOUBLE CIRCULATION LIRA-EURO REPRESENTS THE LAST </p><p>CHANCE FOR HOLDERS OF ITALIAN LIRE OF ILLICIT ORIGIN </p><p>TO TRY TO RECYCLE THROUGH THE CONVERSION IN EURO OR </p><p>THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF GOODS AND INVESTMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>14. ON FEBRUARY 19, LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SEIZED </p><p>NEAR ROME 25,000 COUNTERFEIT 50 AND 200 EURO </p><p>BANKNOTES.  THIS IS THE FIRST SEIZURE OF COUNTERFEIT </p><p>BANKNOTES IN ITALY, WHICH WERE APPARENTLY OF HIGH </p><p>QUALITY.

THANKS TO THE </p><p>SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE OLD 500 LIRE COINS AND THE TWO- </p><p>EURO COINS (BOTH BI-METALLIC AND WITH ALMOST THE SAME </p><p>WEIGHT) IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THE CHANGEOVER, MANY OLD </p><p>500 LIRE COINS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FOR SMALL PAYMENTS </p><p>IN PLACE OF THE TWO-EURO COINS. THE 500-LIRE COIN IS </p><p>VERY SIMILAR, BUT IS WORTH ONLY ONE-EIGHTH (26 EURO </p><p>CENTS) OF A TWO-EURO COIN. </p><p> </p><p>16. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS ANOTHER THREAT.  THE THAI </p><p>10-BAHT COIN IS A PERFECT TWIN OF THE TWO-EURO COIN, </p><p>BUT IS WORTH ONLY 25 EURO CENTS.  ANECDOTALLY, WE HAVE </p><p>HEARD THAT SOME TEN-BAHT COINS HAVE BEEN USED IN </p><p>AUTOMATIC CIGARETTE AND BEVERAGE DISPENSING MACHINES. </p><p> </p><p>ROME MISCELLANY </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>17. FEWER THAN ONE THIRD OF ROMES 365 AUTOMATIC BUS </p><p>TICKET DISPENSERS ACCEPT EURO COINS.

AN ESTIMATED </p><p>ED </p><p>FIVE- PERCENT OF GASOLINE STATIONS DID NOT ACCEPT EURO </p><p>BANKNOTES BY THE END OF FEBRUARY. BY MARCH 1, ALL </p><p>PARKING METERS WILL ACCEPT THE EURO. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18. DESPITE THE INITIAL INCONVENIENCE, THE ITALIAN </p><p>TRANSITION WAS SMOOTHER AND FASTER THAN EXPECTED AND </p><p>MORE ITALIANS ACCEPTED EUROS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED. </p><p>TOO MANY SMALL LIRE BANKNOTES STILL CIRCULATE OR AT </p><p>LEAST REMAIN TO BE EXCHANGED.  THE BANKING </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS DECISION TO PROLONG THE ACCEPTANCE </p><p>PERIOD FOR LIRE SEEMS WISE, GIVEN THE 1.6 BILLION LIRA </p><p>BANKNOTES (WITH AN OVERALL VALUE OF 15.5 BILLION EURO) </p><p>IN CIRCULATION. THE ORIGINAL FEBRUARY 28 DEADLINE FOR </p><p>EXCHANGING THESE NOTES MIGHT HAVE MEANT A LAST MINUTE </p><p>CRUNCH, WHICH COULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS DELAYS IN </p><p>BANKS AND POST OFFICES.  WE ARE MONITORING THE </p><p>INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE CHANGE TO EUROS, AND WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE MONTHS AHEAD.  WE WILL ALSO </p><p>KEEP ON EYE ON WHETHER THERE IS ANY DOWNWARD PRESSURE </p><p>ON PRICES (OR INCREASED DEMAND FOR GREATER </p><p>EFFICIENCIES) AS ITALIANS BEGIN TO NOTICE COST </p><p>DIFFERENTIALS FOR THEIR HIGH-PRICED GOODS AND SERVICES </p><p>COMPARED TO THEIR EURO-ZONE NEIGHBORS.
