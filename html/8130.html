<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000910 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W </p><p>STATE PASS OPIC, TDA, AND EXIM </p><p>STATE PASS USTR AND DOT </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA/MAC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EINV, EAIR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ECONOMIC ROUNDUP MAY 16 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ABUJA 576 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 440 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. This periodic economic report from Abuja and Lagos </p><p>includes: </p><p>--GON Approves World Airways </p><p>--Ministry of Aviation Launches Nigerianglobal </p><p>--Nigeria Bans Ice Cream Imports </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GON Approves World Airways </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>2. Minister of Aviation Kema Chikwe announced at an April 10 </p><p>press conference that U.S. carrier World Airways had been </p><p>approved to begin charter service between Lagos and New York, </p><p>Atlanta, and Houston. World Airlines had hoped to begin </p><p>flying in March but experienced difficulty securing landing </p><p>rights (Ref A). Minister Chikwe attributed the delay in </p><p>approval to the Ministry\'s desire to perform "due diligence" </p><p>on the airline. World Airways would be the first American </p><p>carrier to establish direct service under the 1999 Open Skies </p><p>Agreement. With Nigeria Airways not now flying, the new </p><p>service would be the only direct passenger and air cargo link </p><p>between the United States and Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Chikwe had written the Ambassador April 16 stating that </p><p>Nigeria had approved World Airways to operate flights in and </p><p>out of Nigeria. However, the letter also said "a technical </p><p>and economic assessment of the airline and its Nigerian agent </p><p>would be undertaken by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority </p><p>(NCAA) to facilitate the commencement of operations." A </p><p>diplomatic note dated April 28 conveyed the same information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. We replied to clarify that the terms of the Open Skies </p><p>Agreement give the sending country the authority to designate </p><p>an airline; the role of the receiving country is to grant </p><p>operating authority with minimum procedural delay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. On May 15, Minister Chikwe told the Ambassador and then </p><p>announced to the media at an event to mark a U.S. donation of </p><p>security equipment to Nigeria that World Airways had been </p><p>approved and there were no further requirements for World </p><p>Airways to begin service. She said the letter informing us of </p><p>additional requirements was sent in error. World Airways is </p><p>set to make its inaugural flight to Lagos on May 29, </p><p>inauguration day in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ministry of Aviation Launches Nigerianglobal </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>6. The Ministry of Aviation signed an agreement with Swiss </p><p>firm Triaton AG to operate a new airline called </p><p>Nigerianglobal. The airline, slated to begin operations late </p><p>this month, would assume the international routes of Nigeria </p><p>Airways. We have not received formal word whether </p><p>Nigerianglobal intends to serve the United States. However, </p><p>Triaton\'s business proposal indicates the company plans to </p><p>fly all Nigeria Airways routes, including flights to the </p><p>United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Comment: This is the second time in less than a year that </p><p>Minister Chikwe has tried to create a new national carrier. </p><p>In 2002, a controversial deal with a U.K.-based firm to form </p><p>a new airline from Nigeria Airways\' liquidated assets failed </p><p>after the National Assembly and the Bureau of Public </p><p>Enterprises, alleging a lack of transparency and that the </p><p>Minister had outstripped her authority by unilaterally </p><p>approving the deal (Ref B). The Nigerianglobal deal may face </p><p>the same stiff opposition, including from labor unions </p><p>seeking compensation for Nigeria Airways employees. However, </p><p>President Obasanjo reportedly favors Nigeria having a </p><p>state-owned "national carrier," so some carrier is likely to </p><p>be established. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria Bans Ice Cream Imports </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>8. Director General of the National Agency for Food and Drug </p><p>Administration and Control wrote FAS in Lagos on May 2 that </p><p>ice cream imports would be banned. The letter said that </p><p>"edible ices are delicate products requiring special </p><p>handling" and that "international standards on edible ices </p><p>have been abolished." Therefore, the agency "has discontinued </p><p>the registration of edible ices." The letter concludes: </p><p>"Interested companies have been advised to set up local </p><p>factories for the production of edible ices for the ease of </p><p>monitoring and compliance with national standards." (Note: In </p><p>2002, the United States exported $144,000 in ice cream to </p><p>Nigeria. The makers of "Blue Bunny" ice cream, a brand </p><p>popular in the midwest United States and in Nigeria as well, </p><p>have plans to operate a factory in Nigeria. No timetable for </p><p>the proposed investment is available. End Note.) </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
