<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KHARTOUM 05791 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.:12356:DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, PINS, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  DIRECT ELECTION OF SUDANESE PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.)  STATE 2331119; B.) 89 KHARTOUM 11662 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  ALTHOUGH THE GOS REGULARLY </p><p>REPEATS ITS PLEDGE TO CONDUCT DIRECT ELECTIONS FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL NEED TO BE </p><p>APPROVED BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (CURRENTLY AN </p><p>APPOINTED BODY).  THIS INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT </p><p>ONLY THOSE PERSONS ENJOYING THE GOS SEAL OF APPROVAL </p><p>WILL BE ABLE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  REF A REPORTS THAT FINANCE MINISTER HAMDI </p><p>TOLD DAS HOUDEK THERE WOULD SHORTLY BE "MOVES TOWARD </p><p>A DIRECT ELECTION" OF A SUDANESE PRESIDENT.  DIRECT </p><p>ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A PUBLIC, AND </p><p>REPEATED, GOS PROMISE SINCE THE GOS BEGAN TOUTING </p><p>SUDAN\'S NEW POLITICAL SYSTEM IN 1989 (REF B).  (THE </p><p>WORDS "DIRECT ELECTIONS" ARE ENCASED IN THE BIGGEST </p><p>BLOCK IN THE COLORED LEAFLET, ENTITLED "SUDAN\'S </p><p>POLITICAL SYSTEM," WHICH CONTAINS A DIAGRAM OF THIS </p><p>SYSTEM.  COPY OF LEAFLET WAS POUCHED TO AF/E) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, PRESIDENT BASHIR </p><p>TOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT "THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A </p><p>NEW POLITICAL SYSTEM THROUGH ELECTIONS AND THE </p><p>ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>REPUBLIC WILL TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS, </p><p>BEFORE THE CELEBRATION OF THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF </p><p>THE SUDANESE NATIONAL SALVATION REVOLUTION OF 30 </p><p>JULY."  OBVIOUSLY THIS TIMING, AS WITH MUCH ELSE </p><p>HAVING TO DO WITH THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE SLIPPED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  WE ALSO NOTE THAT (GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED) </p><p>SUDAN NEWS AGENCY\'S "WEEKLY REVIEW" PUBLICATION </p><p>(DATED JUNE 7, 1991) CONTAINED AN ARTICLE ON THE </p><p>POLITICAL SYSTEM\'S STATUTES AND GENERAL PLAN.  THE </p><p>ARTICLE STATES:  "THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC </p><p>SHOULD BE SUDANESE, 35 YEARS OF AGE OR MORE AND </p><p>SHOULD SATISFY THE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS NEEDED FOR </p><p>THE JOB.  ANY ELIGIBLE CANDIDATE SHOULD BE </p><p>RECOMMENDED BY AT LEAST 60 PER CENT OF THE MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE BASIC CONGRESS HE BELONGS TO.  CANDIDATES FOR </p><p>THE POST SHOULD HAVE THE APPROVAL OF AT LEAST 60 PER </p><p>CENT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS. </p><p>CANDIDACY SHOULD BE APPROVED BY THE NATIONAL </p><p>CONGRESS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  APPROVAL OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BY THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, WHICH IS CURRENTLY AN APPOINTED </p><p>ONE, WOULD THUS LIKLELY ASSURE THAT ONLY </p><p>GOS-APPROVED PERSONS COULD RUN.  GOVERNMENT CONTROL </p><p>OF PARTICIPANTS HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT FEATURE IN </p><p>NEARLY EVERY MAJOR PUBLIC FORA ORGANIZED BY THIS </p><p>REGIME (E.G. THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE CONFERENCE, THE </p><p>POLITICAL SYSTEM CONFERENCE, THE TRANSITIONAL </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AMONG OTHERS).  EVEN WHEN THERE </p><p>WAS LESS INTERFERENCE WITH SELECTION OF </p><p>PARTICIPANTS, SUCH AS IN THE NATIONAL FOUNDING </p><p>CONFERENCE ON THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>EXERCISED FIRM CONTROL OVER THE OUTCOME OF THE </p><p>SESSION.  THUS FAR, DESPITE FINANCE MINISTER HAMDI\'S </p><p>OPTIMISM, THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE </p><p>RCC/NIF HAS ANY INTENTION OF OFFERING GENUINE </p><p>POLITICAL CHOICE TO ITS CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHEEK </p><p></p></div>
