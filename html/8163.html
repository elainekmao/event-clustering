DART Field Team West traveled to Karbala to meet with </p><p>local officials and gather assessment information on 15 </p><p>May.  The population is generally friendly and happy with </p><p>the Coalition presence.  There have been neither threats to </p><p>Coalition forces nor targeted incidents.  Sixty Iraqi police </p><p>officers have been trained by Coalition forces with police </p><p>experience.  There are a total of 830 police officers now </p><p>active in Karbala.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The DART met with U.N. World Food Program (WFP) staff, </p><p>Ministry of Trade (MOT) silo manager, and Coalition forces. </p><p>The DART discussed overall food needs in Karbala area and </p><p>confirmed positive WFP assessment of the public distribution </p><p>system (PDS), observed initial arrivals of WFP rice </p><p>deliveries, and confirmed wheat grain stocks in the Karbala </p><p>grain silo. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WFP\'s ten-person national staff is established and </p><p>operational at the MOT warehouse. Two additional staff, </p><p>office and communications equipment, and other operational </p><p>support are due to arrive soon.  WFP has assisted MOT in </p><p>planning initial PDS activities, including the release of </p><p>wheat grain for milling, followed by a flour delivery to </p><p>beneficiaries beginning on 17 May and a rice distribution to </p><p>begin the first part of June. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DART confirmed that the Coalition has vacated the </p><p>grain silo property.  The MOT silo manager claims that </p><p>Coalition forces removed property from the silo grounds and </p><p>has presented an inventory of missing items to battalion </p><p>headquarters.  The DART discussed this issue with a </p><p>Coalition representative who stated that he would follow-up </p><p>to determine a course of action.  Among the items on the MOT </p><p>list are two tractor-trailer cabs, tools, several computers, </p><p>office furniture, and cash from the office safe. </p><p>WFP staff and silo manager asked DART to inquire about </p><p>security assistance from Coalition forces during the </p><p>upcoming food deliveries.  The Coalition source told the </p><p>DART that frequent patrols and visible presence by Coalition </p><p>forces in the area of the silo and warehouses could be </p><p>established and stated that he would follow-up for possible </p><p>action. </p><p> </p><p>5.  WFP stated that public service messages regarding PDS </p><p>had been received and should be improved. Information should </p><p>be focused on instructions to food agents and should include </p><p>precise dates for ration distributions, the per person </p><p>quantity of food to be received and the ration basket </p><p>contents. Beneficiaries will be expecting this information </p><p>as a normal function of PDS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WFP and DART discovered unexploded ordnance (UXO) in one </p><p>area of the MOT warehouse complex.  DART requested and </p><p>received an initial UXO assessment by Coalition forces that </p><p>confirmed UXO contamination.  A request for UXO removal and </p><p>a general mine sweep of the warehouse area has been made </p><p>with a planned sweep set for 18 May. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The DART confirmed that all MOT staff in Karbala </p><p>received USD 20 emergency payments and is in contact with </p><p>MOT Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SECURITY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Challenges in Karbala include a large minefield near the </p><p>"Karbala gap" close to the main cemetery; significant </p><p>amounts of UXOs in the city; and the "Karbala Protection </p><p>Force" (KPF) who are to be disbanded by Saturday and have </p><p>acted as a separate, vigilante type police force with </p><p>considerable criminal element.  There are, however, joint </p><p>patrols with Coalition forces, the police, and the KPF. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  There are newspapers in Karbala, and the former state TV </p><p>station is operating six hours per day. Included in the </p><p>broadcast are UXO and public health messages.  Of Karbala\'s </p><p>population, 40 to 50 percent own televisions, and the rest </p><p>rely on coffee shops and restaurants to get TV news and </p><p>programming. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Interviews with local residents provided mixed reviews </p><p>of Radio SAWA.  The biggest complaints were repetitive news </p><p>and music.  The most popular news broadcast was BBC.  Many </p><p>asked the DART why they could no longer receive Voice of </p><p>America. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>COALITION PRIORITIES FOR KARBALA </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The DART witnessed a well-organized and proficient </p><p>effort by Coalition forces to restore services to Karbala. </p><p>The DART was briefed on several rehabilitation priorities </p><p>for Karbala including: </p><p> </p><p>--  Police professionalism and training:  A 30-officer </p><p>training cadre has been established to increase proficiency </p><p>of local police forces.  Coalition forces are supporting the </p><p>Karbala Police Department by providing uniforms, </p><p>communications equipment, vehicles, weapons and ammunition. </p><p> </p><p>--  Disbanding former militia:  The Karbala Protective Force </p><p>has been deemed antagonistic to rehabilitation efforts and </p><p>will be disbanded by Coalition forces. </p><p>--  Water:  The water system is functioning, but it is </p><p>contaminated and contributes to chronic gastro-intestinal </p><p>problems among Karbala populace.  Four water purification </p><p>units have been provided for Karbala hospitals. The water </p><p>administration headquarters functions at 50 percent and a </p><p>secure chlorine supply is needed.  The International Rescue </p><p>Committee and CARE are present and working on water </p><p>problems. </p><p> </p><p>--  Electricity:  Electricity is reported at pre-war levels </p><p>of 75 percent.  Coalition forces are repairing suspension </p><p>and transmission lines. </p><p> </p><p>--  Education:  One hundred-thirty school buildings have </p><p>been cleared of UXO, and battalion teams have begun </p><p>renovation of five school buildings for various levels of </p><p>students, including adults. Textbooks and curriculum </p><p>development were identified as priority needs. </p><p> </p><p>--  Fuel:  There have been no LPG deliveries in the last 30 </p><p>days and benzene is in short supply. </p><p> </p><p>--  Refuse and Sewage:  Coalition forces have established a </p><p>garbage landfill outside town limits, but it is under- </p><p>utilized.  The former regime flooded the sewage system with </p><p>diesel fuel rendering the system inoperable. </p><p> </p><p>--  UXO and mines are considered a serious and long-term </p><p>issue.   Coalition forces have been mapping UXO sites, and </p><p>removal teams are in the area. </p><p> </p><p>--  Civil Administration:  A city council has been </p><p>appointed, but it is untrained and not yet vetted. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Many of these priorities will increase employment </p><p>opportunities.  Coalition forces estimate unemployment to be </p><p>as high as 85 to 90 percent. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
