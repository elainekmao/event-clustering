<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L PRETORIA 07087 </p><p> </p><p>CAPE TOWN ALSO FOR EMBASSY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: MANDELA REPORTED "FURIOUS" AT TOP ADVISER FOR </p><p>         THWARTING THATCHER MEETING </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) - ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  NELSON MANDELA IS "FURIOUS" WITH TOP ADVISER </p><p>ZWELAKHE SISULU FOR PERSUADING THE ANC LEADERSHIP TO </p><p>VETO HIS PLANS TO MEET MARGARET THATCHER IN LONDON IN </p><p>MID-APRIL, ACCORDING TO A CLOSE SISULU ASSOCIATE. </p><p>GABU TUGWANA (PROTECT), SISULU\'S DEPUTY AT THE "NEW </p><p>NATION" NEWSPAPER, TOLD USIS OFFICER APRIL 27 THAT </p><p>SISULU HAD BEEN THE MOST PERSUASIVE SPEAKER AT THE </p><p>ANC EXECUTIVE MEETING WHICH DECIDED THE ISSUE OF </p><p>WHETHER TO MEET THATCHER.  WE UNDERSTAND MANDELA WAS </p><p>KEEN FOR A THATCHER MEETING, BUT THAT SISULU ARGUED </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST IT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  SISULU, WHO HAS BEEN SECONDED FROM THE "NATION" </p><p>TO WORK AS MANDELA\'S APPOINTMENTS SECRETARY, HAS ALSO </p><p>DRAWN FIRE FROM ANC RANK AND FILE FOR HIS HANDLING OF </p><p>MANDELA\'S SCHEDULE.  WE ARE REGULARLY SURPRISED AT </p><p>HOW OPENLY ACTIVISTS DISPARAGE SISULU\'S MANAGEMENT OF </p><p>MANDELA\'S SCHEDULE TO US.  TRANSKEI LEADER BANTU </p><p>HOLOMISA BECAME SO FRUSTRATED BY DEALING WITH SISULU </p><p>FOR MANDELA\'S VISIT THERE APRIL 21-27, HE TOLD US HE </p><p>INSISTED ON COMPLETE CONTROL OF MANDELA\'S SCHEDULE AS </p><p>THE PRICE FOR THE TRANSKEI GOVERNMENT\'S COOPERATION </p><p>WITH THE VISIT.  SISULU RELENTED.  FOR OUR PART, </p><p>SISULU HAS BEEN NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE IN ARRANGING </p><p>MEETINGS BETWEEN MANDELA AND US OFFICIALS -- IT TOOK </p><p>SEVEN WEEKS OF STEADY HOUNDING TO OBTAIN AN </p><p>APPOINTMENT FOR AMBASSADOR SWING WITH MANDELA.  IN AN </p><p>IRONIC TWIST, THE FORMERLY UNDEPENDABLE WINNIE HAS </p><p>NOW BECOME ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE CHANNELS TO </p><p>MANDELA. </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENT: TUGWANA\'S STORY ABOUT THE ARGUMENTS OVER </p><p>THE THATCHER VISIT RINGS TRUE.  MANDELA HAS ON </p><p>SEVERAL OCCASIONS EXPRESSED HIS EAGERNESS FOR AN </p><p>EARLY MEETING WITH THATCHER TO EXPRESS THE ANC\'S </p><p>OBJECTIONS TO HER POLICY.  WE WERE CONSEQUENTLY </p><p>SURPRISED WHEN THE MEETING DIDN\'T MATERIALIZE ON HIS </p><p>MID-APRIL VISIT TO LONDON, AND SUSPECTED THAT ANC </p><p>HARDLINERS HAD NIXED MANDELA\'S PLANS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SISULU IS A MAN OF MANY TALENTS, AND WE DON\'T </p><p>DOUBT HE HAS THE INTELLECTUAL FORTITUDE TO CONVINCE </p><p>HIS SENIORS IN THE ANC OF ALMOST ANYTHING.  BUT THE </p><p>OVERWHELMING JOB OF KEEPING MANDELA\'S APPOINTMENT </p><p>BOOK IS TAKING ITS TOLL.  "MANDELA NEEDS A GOVERNMENT </p><p>AROUND HIM, NOT JUST ME, TO HANDLE HIS SCHEDULE," HE </p><p>RECENTLY LAMENTED TO US.  WITH THE STILL TIGHT </p><p>COMPETITION FOR INFLUENCE IN THE MANDELA ENTOURAGE, </p><p>SISULU\'S LACK OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACUMEN COULD PROVE A </p><p>DISTINCT LIABILITY. </p><p> </p><p>SWING. </p><p></p></div>
