<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 09557 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL/OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, TU, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA SPECULATION ON MOTIVES FOR NEVE SHALOM </p><p>         ATTACK </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. DURING A LUNCHEON ON SEPTEMBER 15, MFA OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR FOR THE LEVANT AND NORTH AFRICA, SOLMAZ </p><p>UNAYDIN, OBVIOUSLY STILL APPALLED AT THE WANTON </p><p>SLAUGHTER, TOLD POLOFF THAT THE MFA IS AT A LOSS TO </p><p>EXPLAIN THE MOTIVES FOR THE NEVE SHALOM MASSACRE. </p><p>CONSIDERING THE PECULIAR AWFULNESS IN MUSLIM EYES OF </p><p>KILLING PEOPLE AT PRAYER, SHE SAID, IT WAS HARD TO </p><p>UNDERSTAND WHAT ANY ARAB OR OTHER MUSLIM GROUP COULD </p><p>HAVE HOPED TO GAIN.  THE OFFICIAL ADMITTED THAT IT </p><p>WAS POSSIBLE THAT SOME MILITANT GROUP COULD HAVE </p><p>WISHED TO EMBROIL TURKEY IN THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT, </p><p>BUT SHE BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN </p><p>ONLY A SUBSIDIARY MOTIVE.  SIMILARLY, SHE ARGUED THAT </p><p>IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PARTLY AN ATTEMPT TO SEPARATE </p><p>TURKEY FROM THE UNITED STATES OR--LESS </p><p>LIKELY--ISRAEL.  THIS WAS NOT THE MOST PROBABLE </p><p>THEORY, SHE CONTENDED, BECAUSE THE PREDICTABLE NET </p><p>EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN WHAT IN FACT TRANSPIRED, </p><p>INCREASED COOPERATION AGAINST TERRORISM AMONG THE </p><p>THREE NATIONS, AND A GREATER IMPETUS TOWARD SIMILAR </p><p>COOPERATION BETWEEN TURKEY AND THE WESTERN EUROPEAN </p><p>STATES. </p><p> </p><p>3. MRS. UNAYDIN BELIEVES THAT IT IS MOST SIGNIFICANT </p><p>THAT WITHIN ONLY A FEW DAYS BOTH TURKEY AND PAKISTAN, </p><p>THE MOST STABLE AND MODERATE MUSLIM ALLIES OF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES IN THE REGION, SHOULD HAVE BEEN </p><p>ATTACKED IN THIS WAY.  SHE SPECULATED THAT THE </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO EMBARRASS </p><p>THE TWO STATES, AND TO CONSTITUTE SOME SORT OF </p><p>WARNING AGAINST THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS OR AGAINST ANY ACTIONS CONTRARY TO THE </p><p>INTERESTS OF MILITANT MUSLIMS. </p><p> </p><p>4. WHILE SHE COULD NOT SAY WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE, </p><p>UNAYDIN ASKED POLOFF WHETHER THE UNITED STATES HAD </p><p>ANY BETTER INFORMATION THAN TURKEY ABOUT THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY THAT ABU NIDAL HAD BEEN BEHIND THE TWO </p><p>EVENTS.  THEY BOTH SEEMED TO BEAR HIS GROUP\'S </p><p>HALLMARKS: CAREFUL PLANNING AND EXECUTION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STRAUSZ-HUPE </p><p></p></div>
