Gnehm for reasons 1.5(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ambassador Gnehm visited newly elected Speaker of the </p><p>Parliament, Saad Hayel Srour, and discussed issues related to </p><p>the new Parliament including the ongoing debate on temporary </p><p>laws, Iraq, and the peace process and U.S.-Jordanian </p><p>relations.END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>INITIAL PRAISE FOR MPs </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On Saturday, August 2, Ambassador Gnehm and PolOff </p><p>paid a courtesy call on the newly elected Speaker of the </p><p>Parliament, Saad Hayel Srour.  After an initial exchange of </p><p>pleasantries, the Ambassador asked Srour about his views on </p><p>the new Parliament.  Srour confided that although the start </p><p>of the special session had not been easy, things were going </p><p>well and he was happy with the overall level of cooperation </p><p>from members.  He explained that only 20 percent of the new </p><p>members were from the old parliament and this created </p><p>continuity problems but praised new members for their high </p><p>levels of education. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>DEBATE AND PASSAGE OF TEMPORARY LAWS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador stressed his strong support for the </p><p>bold steps taken by the GOJ regarding economic reform and </p><p>hoped there would be speedy movement in the Parliament to </p><p>ratify temporary laws related to the economy.  Srour said he </p><p>expected things to go the "right way", and highlighted that </p><p>there is agreement in principle by many MPs to ratify most of </p><p>the temporary laws.  Some 35 temporary laws, he added, have </p><p>been sent to committees for discussion.  Although optimistic, </p><p>he does expect some proposed amendments. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>VOTE OF CONFIDENCE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Srour advised that the Parliament will meet after </p><p>August 6 to debate the new reshuffled government (refs b and </p><p>c) and expected the deliberations to take 4-5 days.  He </p><p>viewed this development as a positive step and one which will </p><p>allow MPs to express to the GOJ their views on the new </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>ISLAMIST MPs </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador expressed interest in reaching out to </p><p>all factions in the Parliament, particularly the Islamists. </p><p>He emphasized the need to explain to them about the Embassy\'s </p><p>programs and how they benefit Jordan.  Srour encouraged the </p><p>Ambassador to reach out to the Islamists.  He described them </p><p>as "difficult" people, while also characterizing some of them </p><p>as politically well educated.  Of the 17 Islamic Action Front </p><p>(IAF) MPs, he classified 2-3 as particularly difficult and </p><p>the rest as moderates.  He said some are willing to talk and </p><p>are not hard to deal with, and promised to encourage them to </p><p>talk with Embassy officials. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>JORDAN\'S TWO HEADED SERPENT: OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AND IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  On Iraq, the Ambassador told Srour that although </p><p>things have moved slowly, progress is being made though not </p><p>reported by the press.  He said that most of our difficulties </p><p>have been in an area north and west of Baghdad.  The </p><p>situation in the Shi\'a south and in the north is much better. </p><p> The challenge now for the U.S. is to find credible Sunni </p><p>contacts.  He stressed the U.S. wants the Governing Council </p><p>to make the tough decisions.  Srour hoped to see continued </p><p>progress and linked reconstruction in Iraq to an improvement </p><p>in Jordan\'s economy.  He believes that Jordan\'s unskilled and </p><p>unemployed workers, which he estimated at between 60-70,000, </p><p>would benefit if economic opportunities opened up in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) On the peace process, the Ambassador stated how </p><p>U.S.-Jordanian cooperation positively influenced the </p><p>direction of policy on this issue.  He also focused on the </p><p>close relationship between President Bush and the King. </p><p>President Bush, the Ambassador added, is committed to an </p><p>independent Palestinian state and had pressed PM Sharon on </p><p>settlements and the security fence.  The Palestinians, the </p><p>Ambassador concluded, must keep the peace and fight violence. </p><p> Srour emphasized how the Palestinian issue had a direct </p><p>impact on Jordan\'s economy.  If people don\'t believe or trust </p><p>that there will be progress, he explained, they hold back on </p><p>spending.  If they see hope, they spend their money and </p><p>strengthen the economy.  He felt that both PM Abu Mazen and </p><p>the Palestinian Authority, as well as PM Sharon, could do </p><p>more to explain the delicate issues and highlight progress to </p><p>give people hope. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>U.S. - Jordanian relations </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  The Ambassador again reiterated U.S. government </p><p>support for the King\'s economic program and highlighted the </p><p>U.S. aid provided to Jordan this year.  Although the level of </p><p>aid would not remain at the same level next year, Ambassador </p><p>Gnehm explained, the U.S. would continue to support the </p><p>King\'s economic programs so that Jordan\'s poor could benefit </p><p>from economic progress. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Srour expressed concern that American policy is not </p><p>clear to many parliamentarians.  He felt that their </p><p>understanding is often based on what they read in the local </p><p>media, thus their impressions are formed by what the media </p><p>interprets as U.S. policy.  He felt more could be done to </p><p>improve this situation and encouraged the Ambassador to </p><p>connect future visiting CODELS with MPs to establish a </p><p>communication "bridge" between U.S. and Jordanian lawmakers. </p><p>This would further help parliamentarians understand economic </p><p>laws and how they relate to global issues. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
