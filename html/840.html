THE ELABORATE RETIREMENT CEREMONY </p><p>WAS ACTUALLY A POLITICAL EVENT MADE PALATABLE BY A </p><p>PATINA OF MILITARY POMP. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. IN A CEREMONY AT 22 JULY SQUARE IN DOWNTOWN BANJUL, </p><p>RECENTLY PROMOTED (EFFECTIVE DATE 28 AUGUST) COLONEL </p><p>YAHYA JAMMEH RETIRED, WITH SUITABLE POMP AND </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCE, FROM THE GAMBIAN ARMY.  THE CEREMONY WAS </p><p>A COMBINATION OF BRITISH MILITARY TRADITION AND AFRICAN </p><p>SPICE.  OFFICIALLY TERMED A PARADE, THE BACKDROP WAS </p><p>PROVIDED BY A SHARP-LOOKING UNIT OF ABOUT 250 FATIGUE- </p><p>CLAD SOLDIERS AND A 30-PIECE ARMY BAND.  THE TROOPS </p><p>MARCHED WELL, AND THEIR OFFICERS AND NCO SHOUTED </p><p>COMMANDS IN THE BEST BRITISH ARMY SQUARE BASHING </p><p>MANNER. </p><p> </p><p>3. JAMMEH, AS IS HIS WONT, ARRIVED ABOUT ONE HOUR LATE </p><p>IN THE USUAL MULTI-VEHICLE CONVOY FROM HIS COMPOUND </p><p>DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE SQUARE.   EVEN THOUGH HE HAD </p><p>NOT YET OFFICIALLY RETIRED, HE APPEARED IN HIS </p><p>ELECTIONEERING ENSEMBLE (A GREEN BRIMLESS AFRICAN HAT </p><p>SET UPON AN ORANGE BURNOOSE-LIKE AFFAIR AND A LIGHT </p><p>BLUE BOU BOU, WITH A TRADITIONAL DESERT WARRIOR\'S SWORD </p><p>HELD IN HIS RIGHT HAND) RATHER THAN THE FULL COLONEL\'S </p><p>UNIFORM ONE WOULD EXPECT FOR A RETIREMENT CEREMONY. </p><p>THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES READ A SHORT, BUT EXHAUSTIVE </p><p>LIST OF THE COLONEL\'S MILITARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS, </p><p>INCLUDING HIS MILITARY POLICE OFFICER COURSE AT FORT </p><p>MCCLELLAN, ALABAMA (WHICH HE COMPLETED AS A FIRST </p><p>LIEUTENANT IN EARLY 1994, JUST BEFORE HIS METEORIC RISE </p><p>THROUGH THE RANKS BEGAN). </p><p> </p><p>4. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A SHORT SPEECH BY THE CHAIRMAN </p><p>IN WHICH HE STATED THAT WHILE HE WOULD ALWAYS BE A </p><p>SOLDIER AT HEART, HE WAS GIVING IN TO THE WISHES OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE AND RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  THIS MENTION OF HIS </p><p>CANDIDACY BROUGHT SUSTAINED CHEERING FROM HIS MANY </p><p>SUPPORTERS IN THE CROWD.  HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE </p><p>PEOPLE LOOKED TO THE MILITARY AND POLICE TO MAINTAIN </p><p>THE PEACE DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN.  HE FINISHED BY </p><p>ASSURING THE TROOPS  "THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE DONE TO </p><p>IMPROVE YOUR CONDITIONS." </p><p> </p><p>5. HE THEN INSPECTED THE TROOPS WHILE WHAT WAS </p><p>DESCRIBED AS A 21-GUN SALUTE BY THE MC WAS FIRED IN THE </p><p>BACKGROUND.  THE SALUTE SEEMED TO RUN CLOSER TO ABOUT </p><p>13 GUNS, AND THE GUNS THEMSELVES WERE NOT ACTUALLY </p><p>GUNS, BUT SOMETHING CLOSER TO FIRECRACKERS, WHICH THREE </p><p>SOLDIERS AT A FAR COSNER OF THE SQUARE LIT AND TOSSED </p><p>ABOUT 15 FEET, WHERE THEY EXPLODED WITH FLASHES, BANGS </p><p>AND SMOKE.  UPON HIS RETURN TO THE VIEWING STAND, THE </p><p>TROOPS MARCHED OFF THE FIELD WITH THE BAND PLAYING AULD </p><p>LANG SANG, FOUR BAGPIPERS PLAYED A MEDLEY, AND THEN A </p><p>GROUP OF ABOUT 60 SOLDIERS RETURNED TO THE FIELD FOR A </p><p>MARTIAL ARTS DEMONSTRATION. </p><p> </p><p>6. THIS LAST WAS CHOREOGRAPHED BY ONE OF A TRIO OF </p><p>NORTH KOREAN MILITARY MEN LURKING IN THE BACKGROUND OF </p><p>THE CEREMONY.  STANDING ON A CHAIR AND GIVING A SERIES </p><p>OF HAND SIGNALS, THE COMRADE HAD HIS CHARGES CHOPPING, </p><p>KICKING, FENDING OFF AND GENERALLY FIGHTING, IF NOT AS </p><p>WELL VAN DAMME, AT LEAST AS WELL AS A GRADUATING CLASS </p><p>AT ANY NORTHERN VIRGINIA JHOON RHEE KARATE DOJO.  THE </p><p>CROWD LOVED IT.  THE FINALE, A BRICK BREAKING </p><p>DEMONSTRATI0N, REALLY BROUGHT THEM TO THEIR FEET. </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENT. THERE WERE PROBABLY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE </p><p>IN THE SQUARE AND ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND LOOKING ON </p><p>THROUGH THE BARRED PERIMETER FENCE.  MOST OF BANJUL, </p><p>HOWEVER, APPEARED NOT TO CARE LESS ABOUT WHAT HAD TO BE </p><p>THE BIGGEST EVENT IN TOWN ON THAT DAY.  THE STREETS </p><p>WERE FULL OF PEOPLE GOING ABOUT THEIR NORMAL BUSINESS </p><p>WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SQUARE, </p><p>GIVING THE NOISY GOINGS ON A SECOND GLANCE.  WHETHER </p><p>THEY WERE JUST TOO BUSY OR REALLY NOT ALL THAT FOND OF </p><p>JAMMEH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROHN </p><p></p></div>
