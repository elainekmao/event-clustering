<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BRASILIA 004227 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/BSC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, BR, Economic Policy & General Analysis </p><p>SUBJECT: A/S REICH\'S MEETING WITH LULA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLOFF RICHARD REITER FOR REASONS 1.5(b) AND (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) SUMMARY. Assistant Secretary Reich had warm and </p><p>productive meetings in Brasilia November 20-21 with </p><p>President-elect Lula da Silva, his senior advisors in the PT, </p><p>and Brazilian congressional leaders.  Both Ambassador Reich </p><p>and Lula expressed great interest in working together across </p><p>a range of issues, particularly trade.  The PT team floated </p><p>the idea of concluding a bilateral trade pact with the US, </p><p>but will first consult with their Mercosul partners and then </p><p>likely raise some proposals during Lula\'s December 10 visit </p><p>to Washington.  Lula is eager to meet President Bush, sure </p><p>that "two politicians like us will understand each other when </p><p>we meet face to face."  In keeping with efforts by Lula to </p><p>distance himself from Castro and Hugo Chavez, PT leader </p><p>Aloizio Mercadante sought to downplay his participation in </p><p>the "Sao Paulo Forum" as an attempt to set a democratic </p><p>example for other Latin American leftists.  Ambassador Reich </p><p>also met with Brazilian congressional leaders, who similarly </p><p>expressed eagerness to strengthen ties with the US in order </p><p>to help address pressing economic and social needs.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>RELATIONSHIP OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) WHA Assistant Secretary Otto Reich led a delegation to </p><p>Brasilia November 20-21 that included WHA/BSC Director James </p><p>Carragher, Special Advisor William Perry, and Michael Zarin </p><p>of S/P.  The group, accompanied by Ambassador Hrinak and </p><p>Poloff (notetaker), met November 21 with President-elect Lula </p><p>da Silva and his three senior advisors: Jose Dirceu, Workers\' </p><p>Party (PT) President and Federal Deputy from Sao Paulo; </p><p>Aloizio Mercadante, PT Federal Deputy and Senator-elect from </p><p>Sao Paulo; and Antonio Palocci, who resigned this week as </p><p>mayor of Riberao Preto (SP) to devote full time to leading </p><p>Lula\'s transition team.  All three will have high profile </p><p>positions in the new government. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The messages on both sides were extremely positive. </p><p>Before Lula joined the meeting, Jose Dirceu expressed the </p><p>interest of the incoming government in strengthening </p><p>Brazil/US ties.  He said the December 10 visit by Lula to </p><p>Washington should focus on items on both countries\' agendas, </p><p>including FTAA and free trade, protectionism, terrorism, and </p><p>the possibility of war in Iraq, which would have economic </p><p>consequences for Brazil. </p><p> </p><p>LET\'S GET BEYOND THE HEADLINES </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>4. (C) Assistant Secretary Reich commented that even after </p><p>9/11 the US will continue to pursue a range of interests </p><p>(commercial, economic, political, security) in the </p><p>hemisphere.  President Bush\'s phone call to Lula after the </p><p>Brazilian elections and invitation to the White House are </p><p>strong signals of the USG\'s desire to strengthen ties to </p><p>Brazil under Lula.  The message, Reich emphasized, is that </p><p>the US and the incoming Brazilian government need to get </p><p>beyond any preconceptions we may have had about each other </p><p>and focus on things that bring us together.  The media often </p><p>highlight policy differences, he added, but it is President </p><p>Bush who sets the USG\'s direction, and he wants to strengthen </p><p>the US/Brazil relationship.  Reich also reviewed the US </p><p>position on Iraq, noting that there would not have been the </p><p>current need to force compliance if Saddam Hussein had </p><p>complied with the sixteen UN resolutions since 1991. </p><p> </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE PACT ON THE HORIZON? </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>5. (C) Commenting on Mercadante\'s remark to D/USTR Peter </p><p>Allgeier the day before that the US seems unwilling to </p><p>negotiate a bilateral trade agreement with Brazil, Reich said </p><p>the US was flexible on the best approach to free trade but </p><p>that his impression was that Brazil was not interested in </p><p>such a bilateral pact.  Mercadante noted that Mercosul </p><p>partners Argentina and Uruguay are currently in crisis, which </p><p>has scared foreign investors throughout South America.  Thus </p><p>Brazil\'s two highest priorities with the US are: obtaining US </p><p>support in gaining increased access to commercial credit (and </p><p>demonstrating that Brazil is a better risk than Argentina); </p><p>and secondly, to increase foreign trade, and particularly to </p><p>double trade with the US in the next four years.  How, </p><p>Mercadante asked, can the US/Brazilian trade total only $30 </p><p>billion per year? </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Mercadante urged that the US and Brazil sit down to </p><p>discuss a range of bilateral trade issues, for example, IPR </p><p>and music piracy, ethanol sales, and aircraft exports.  He </p><p>added that FTAA ("ALCA" in Portuguese) will be a much more </p><p>difficult project, but that the bilateral talks could start </p><p>immediately.  Reflecting the PT\'s dedication to regional </p><p>partners, Mercadante urged that the US seek a trade pact with </p><p>Mercosul.  Ambassador Reich said he was pleased to hear of </p><p>Mercadante\'s interest in such talks, noting that the US is </p><p>open to bilateral pacts (e.g., Chile) as well as pacts with </p><p>sub-regional groups (e.g. the Central American states). </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador Hrinak asked Mercadante if Lula would be </p><p>extending an invitation to bilateral talks during the </p><p>Washington visit.  Jose Dirceu answered before Mercadante </p><p>could, saying that the bilateral talks were important but </p><p>would have to be approached in the context of Brazil\'s </p><p>regional commitments.  Dirceu admitted that the incoming </p><p>government would like to conclude a bilateral pact quickly, </p><p>but as Brazil is the only stable economic force in South </p><p>America, they would have to proceed cautiously and in concert </p><p>with regional partners.  Mercadante said that Lula will </p><p>travel to Argentina on December 3, and then there will be a </p><p>December 5-6 meeting of Mercosul presidents in Brasilia. </p><p>Lula would use these opportunities to sound out the Mercosul </p><p>partners on future negotiating mechanisms --for example a </p><p>Mercosul 4 1 with the US.  After these talks, Mercadante </p><p>said, it is possible Lula would arrive in Washington with </p><p>"some initiatives".  Dirceu summed up by noting that while </p><p>Brazil must consult its regional partners, it "does not want </p><p>to be held hostage by them." </p><p> </p><p>LULA WANTS STRONG TIES AND TOUGH NEGOTIATING </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>8. (C)  President-elect Lula then joined the meeting and </p><p>enthusiastically stated his interest in strong bilateral </p><p>relations across the range of issues.  That, he said, is what </p><p>is motivating him to travel to Washington on December 10. </p><p>Appearing upbeat, smartly-dressed and rested, Lula expressed </p><p>hope that after his visit, US officials will no longer </p><p>misunderstand the PT.  Looking forward to meeting President </p><p>Bush, he said "I think two politicians like us will </p><p>understand each other when we meet face to face."  Brazil\'s </p><p>image has suffered in recent years, he said, and the PT wants </p><p>to consolidate its democracy and rescue it from the </p><p>perception that Brazilian officials are a "bunch of </p><p>irresponsible thieves" and "Brazil is another Colombia." </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The PT has the sense that Brazil can play an important </p><p>role but can only reach its potential in cooperation with the </p><p>US.  In a left jab at the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, Lula </p><p>echoed remarks that he has made in public: "I want to do for </p><p>Brazilians what you US diplomats do for your citizens --fight </p><p>for their interests.  But I think Brazilian diplomacy has not </p><p>been tough enough, not like yours.  We have sometimes made </p><p>bad deals."  Dirceu added that the Brazilian government is </p><p>committed to abiding by all agreements that it inherits, "We </p><p>do not need any more headaches" that we would get by breaking </p><p>deals, he said.  The PT team has emphasized its interest in </p><p>negotiating FTAA with the US, but doing so by vigorously </p><p>defending Brazil\'s interests.  After the meeting, Mercadante </p><p>told the press. "The Americans always played tough, and now </p><p>they have a Brazilian administration that is going to play as </p><p>tough as they do." </p><p> </p><p>"WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF THE PT" </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>10. (C) Ambassador Reich congratulated Lula on his election </p><p>victory, adding that his own visit was designed to follow up </p><p>on President Bush\'s post-election phone call and lay the </p><p>groundwork for the December 10 visit.  Ambassador Reich </p><p>expressed support for Lula\'s social agenda ("Your commitment </p><p>to three meals a day for every Brazilian is something that </p><p>all Americans will want to support."), adding that </p><p>democratization, human rights, economic progress, and </p><p>transparency are key issues for the US public and policy </p><p>makers.  Reich concluded, "We are not afraid of the PT and </p><p>its social agenda". </p><p> </p><p>PALOCCI\'S ECONOMIC MESSAGE:  CREDIT, CREDIT, CREDIT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>11. (C) After Lula was called away, Transition Director </p><p>Antonio Palocci picked up on the economic themes.  He stated </p><p>unequivocally that the PT government will focus on combating </p><p>inflation and working smoothly with the IFIs.  Modifying </p><p>Mercadante\'s two priorities a bit, Palocci said Lula would </p><p>take two messages to Washington.  First, that Brazil really </p><p>has three short-term priorities: credit, credit, and credit; </p><p>and second, that Brazil will seek clear understandings and </p><p>strong relations with the US in order to develop and grow. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Ambassador Reich observed that the USG does not </p><p>direct banks to extend credit, but that the Brazilians </p><p>themselves were doing the right things to gain access to </p><p>loans.  Reich noted that "since the elections you have been </p><p>sending the right messages", adding that Brazilian/US </p><p>cooperation will reinforce these messages by conveying to the </p><p>financial markets US confidence in Brazil\'s economy. </p><p> </p><p>"THE PT IS A MODEL FOR LATIN AMERICAN LEFTISTS" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Ambassador Reich asked Mercadante about the "Sao </p><p>Paulo Forum", which Mercadante has addressed and which has </p><p>included FARC and Cuban participants, among others. </p><p>Mercadante downplayed the PT\'s work in the Forum, explaining </p><p>that his primary interest is in developing the left in Latin </p><p>America, and that many of the participants in the Forum are </p><p>unreconstructed "outdated" leftists who can learn a lot from </p><p>the PT\'s democratic model and emphasis on economic </p><p>development.  He added that the Forum had issued a </p><p>declaration after 9/11 condemning the terrorist attacks and </p><p>defending the right of the US to respond in self-defense. </p><p>"We are democratic," Mercadante assured us, "Washington needs </p><p>to hear our ideas and our arguments." </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) On Colombia, Dirceu said that the FARC needs to </p><p>understand that if they cross into Brazilian territory, </p><p>Lula\'s government will use the military and "treat them as </p><p>enemies."  He added that groups such as the FARC that operate </p><p>outside of democratic processes "do not interest us".  After </p><p>Ambassador Reich outlined the range of human rights concerns </p><p>in Cuba, Dirceu responded that "the strongest force in the </p><p>world for changing Cuba is US trade", but he concluded that </p><p>"we will simply have to agree to disagree" on Cuba policy. </p><p> </p><p>WASHINGTON AGENDA </p><p>----------------- </p><p>15. (C)  Mercadante said that he will accompany Lula to </p><p>Washington.  The rest of the travel team has not been </p><p>decided, and the agenda will be finalized only after </p><p>consultations with the Brazilian embassy in Washington, </p><p>though Ambassador Barbosa has been consulting in Brasilia </p><p>this week. </p><p> </p><p>INAUGURATION LIKELY JANUARY 1 </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>16. (C)  In response to a question from Ambassador Reich, </p><p>Dirceu stated that the inauguration will be on January 1. </p><p>(N.b., Dirceu himself was a big proponent of moving the date </p><p>to January 6 and had been urging his congressional colleagues </p><p>to take quick action on the required constitutional </p><p>amendment, so his statement on the January 1 date may well be </p><p>the last word.)  Minister Pedro Parente, head of the outgoing </p><p>administration\'s transition team, also told us November 21 </p><p>that the inauguration would be January 1. </p><p> </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL MEETINGS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>17. (C) Earlier, Ambassador Reich\'s group met with outgoing </p><p>Chamber Speaker and PSDB leader Aecio Neves and separately </p><p>with PT Senate leader Eduardo Suplicy from Sao Paulo and PT </p><p>Deputy Waldir Pires from Bahia.  Neves, who will take over as </p><p>Governor of Minas Gerais in January, focused his remarks on </p><p>Brazil\'s economic plight.  He noted that he had supported the </p><p>economic plan of President Cardoso, which had prevented </p><p>Brazil from suffering the same fate as Argentina.  He also </p><p>stressed that the PSDB and other opposition parties expect to </p><p>support many of Lula\'s initiatives.  Suplicy stressed the </p><p>importance of President Bush\'s understanding the Brazilian </p><p>democratic process and the fact that Lula\'s 61% electoral </p><p>support demonstrated that he has overwhelming legitimacy to </p><p>address social and economic issues.  Both Suplicy and Pires </p><p>spoke at length on the importance of addressing Brazil\'s deep </p><p>social inequities.  Suplicy added that Lula may be a useful </p><p>bridge in improving US relations with Cuba, to which </p><p>Ambassador Reich replied that relations will improve as soon </p><p>as Castro holds free elections. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>18. (C)  Lula and the senior PT officials are clearly eager </p><p>to get down to work with us, and this visit went a long way </p><p>toward reassuring them that the feeling is mutual.  Though </p><p>they have not yet thought through their floater for bilateral </p><p>trade talks, we can expect some sort of proposal in </p><p>Washington, after they have consulted more deeply with their </p><p>Mercosul partners as well as internally. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) The PT leaders have contrasting and complementary </p><p>personalities.  Mercadante\'s former radicalism lies not far </p><p>from the surface.  He speaks to convince rather than explain, </p><p>often pointing a finger at his listeners.  Yet he is </p><p>courteous and clearly focused on specific bilateral projects. </p><p> Dirceu is much smoother.  He never corrected Mercadante but </p><p>sometimes stepped in to qualify his remarks.  Dirceu seems to </p><p>be the first among equals and is rumored to become Lula\'s </p><p>Chief-of-Staff if he does not stay in Congress to become the </p><p>Speaker of the Chamber.  Palocci, whose star has risen </p><p>rapidly in recent months, is perhaps the most pragmatic of </p><p>the group.  He speaks slowly and calmly --often about </p><p>economic issues-- clearly aware of the effect of his words. </p><p>His is a voice seemingly designed to reassure the markets. </p><p>In a November 21 meeting with U/S Larson (septel), Cardoso </p><p>administration minister Parente expressed great admiration </p><p>for Palocci and hoped that we would become Minister of </p><p>Finance.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) AMBASSADOR REICH CLEARED THIS CABLE. </p><p></p></div>
