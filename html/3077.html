<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002954 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>IIP/G/NEA (BDURANT); NEA/PPD (JBAROODY, CBOURGEOIS, </p><p>JGAFFNEY); NEA/ARN (SZIADEH) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP,  OEXC,  SCUL,  JO </p><p>SUBJECT: DVC Program on "The Protection of Webs Sites on the </p><p>Internet": Program Evaluation </p><p> </p><p>1.   Summary: In cooperation with the National </p><p>Center for Intellectual Property (NCIP), PAS Amman conducted </p><p>the third DVC program of a series on IPR on Monday, June 3 </p><p>at 1400 GMT.  Audience consisted of over sixty lawyers, </p><p>judges, businessmen, and academicians who displayed great </p><p>interest in the topic of discussion. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Description of Activity: The 90 minute session took </p><p>place in the Public Affair\'s Auditorium. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Date: June 3, 2002; Third Quarter FY-2002 </p><p> </p><p>4. Justification and Objectives: The DVC program helped </p><p>introduce a number of issues of large concern to the </p><p>different professions in our audience, such as law </p><p>enforcement in protecting web sites and the advantages of </p><p>protecting web sites.  Mr. Christopher Merriam underlined </p><p>the legitimacy of downloading programs and other material </p><p>from the internet.  He also emphasised that "IPR fosters the </p><p>growth of industries" in particular the music and games </p><p>industries which also widely advertise on line. </p><p> </p><p>5. MPP Goal: This program supported the MPP goals on </p><p>economic reform and promoting understanding and appreciation </p><p>of U.S society and values. </p><p> </p><p>6. Result/impact: Good.  The Jordanian audience seemed </p><p>pleased with the discussion directed by the four panelists </p><p>in the program, Mr. Christopher Merriam, Mr. Stevan </p><p>Mitchell, Ms. Maria Luisa Simpson and Mr. Robert Hunter. </p><p>They felt that it explained a lot of their queries and </p><p>helped clarify certain issues of copyright legitimacy to </p><p>them.  However, the panelists\' talks were rather longwinded, </p><p>which led the audience to become fairly bored and restless, </p><p>as this session is intended to be interactive. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Mitchell who was the first to speak introduced the </p><p>Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) and its role </p><p>as a trade association.  He mentioned that IDSA is the </p><p>private publisher of over thirty games and explained its </p><p>role in protecting its\' customers\' web sites on the internet </p><p>and in preventing copyright infringement.  Mr. Hunter spoke </p><p>about E-businesses such as Napster, which was deactivated. </p><p>He compared the downloading of music from it as similar to </p><p>stealing a CD from a music store but mentioned that no one </p><p>was ever prosecuted for using it.  Ms. Simpson spoke of </p><p>copyright law in the United States and justified the </p><p>rationale behind its evolution.  However, she mentioned that </p><p>she could not comment further on the implementation of </p><p>copyright law in Jordan because each country has its </p><p>legislators who decide what laws best fit its economy with </p><p>regards to its nature. </p><p>Mr. Merriam also touched on the seriousness of copyright </p><p>infringement and counterfeiting under U.S. law and mentioned </p><p>that counterfeiting is a felony for which a ten year prison </p><p>sentence can be ruled, as well as a $2 million fine. </p><p>A member of the audience amused by the high technology </p><p>discussed throughout the course of the program, commented on </p><p>the existence of "cyber cops" saying that "Jordan doesn\'t </p><p>have standard regular cops, let alone cyber cops!"  He also </p><p>went on to say that much of what was discussed in the </p><p>program was invaluable but unfamiliar to most Jordanians. </p><p>Him being a U.S. graduate and a regular visitor of IT fairs </p><p>in the U.S. and Europe, found that the program unveiled many </p><p>new topics related to copyright laws and approaches to the </p><p>protection of web sites on the internet. </p><p> </p><p>7. Comments: Three ISDN lines were used to make the </p><p>connection.  These ISDN lines yielded a very good picture, </p><p>resolution and sound.  The connection was not obstructed at </p><p>all during the program. </p><p> </p><p>8. Quality of Support: Excellent.  PAS Amman appreciates the </p><p>support of IIP/G/NEA and NEA/PPD.  Many thanks go to Ms. </p><p>Inga McMichael for her continuous support.  We look forward </p><p>to future cooperation and success on the last DVC program of </p><p>this quarterly series on IPR.
