<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000563 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>AF/S FOR RAYNOR </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION U.S. BLAMED FOR ZIM\'S WOES; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "MDC lacks respect for human life" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" used its March 19 </p><p>      editorial to accuse the United States of stirring up the </p><p>      current socioeconomic and political turbulence in Zimbabwe. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .As if to give credence to claims by the white </p><p>      Commonwealth, Britain and the United States that the </p><p>      situation in Zimbabwe was deteriorating, the MDC has </p><p>      gone on an orgy of violence and terror against its </p><p>      perceived enemies.  Two innocent lives have been </p><p>      lost so far at the hands of the MDC in the battle </p><p>      for the Kuwadzana constituency.  While the MDC is </p><p>      petrol-bombing its opponents, burning down buses or </p><p>      deliberately running over innocent pedestrians and </p><p>      firing weapons indiscriminately like lawless </p><p>      hoodlums. . .the American Government is, on the </p><p>      other hand, encouraging this lawlessness with its </p><p>      renewed onslaught on Zimbabwe.  By targeting </p><p>      sanctions on the Zimbabwean government as part of </p><p>      measures to remove the ruling ZANU PF from power, </p><p>      the United States has effectively provided cover to </p><p>      the opposition to carry on with its wanton killing, </p><p>      beatings and torture of innocent Zimbabweans. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .As if to cheer the MDC on, the United States </p><p>      started running an illegal radio station this week </p><p>      to support dissent in Zimbabwe.  The pirate radio </p><p>      station was also meant to give impetus to </p><p>      yesterday\'s mass action. . .  The United States also </p><p>      announced the renewal of a so-called executive order </p><p>      by President George W. Bush renewing sanctions and a </p><p>      freeze on alleged assets owned by President Mugabe </p><p>      and 76 other ZANU PF officials.  The U.S. freeze has </p><p>      been in place for more than a year but the Americans </p><p>      know full well that there are no such assets in </p><p>      their country.  The sanctions are, however, meant to </p><p>      destroy the Zimbabwean economy and instead blame it </p><p>      on the ZANU PF government.  Working with the British </p><p>      and a few other European Union countries, the U.S. </p><p>      has managed to squeeze the Zimbabwean economy, </p><p>      shutting its normal offshore loans, grants and </p><p>      investments, resulting in acute shortages of foreign </p><p>      currency that have led to scarcity in fuel and other </p><p>      essential imports. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
