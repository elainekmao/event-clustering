<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 001978 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/RA, NEA/NGA, PRM/ANE, AND </p><p>IO/UNP </p><p>KUWAIT FOR HOC AND ORHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL 04/26/08 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: UAE RED CRESCENT: READY TO DO MORE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABU DHABI 1938 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) In a 4/26 meeting with Econchief, UAE Red </p><p>Crescent Authority (RCA) Secretary General San\'a Al- </p><p>Kitbi confirmed press reports that an RCA ship loaded </p><p>with 700 tons of food and medicine and 12 ambulances </p><p>left the UAE 4/25 for Umm Qasr.  RCA teams already </p><p>operating in southern Iraq will distribute the aid. </p><p>This was the second such shipment from the RCA to </p><p>Iraq, with the first having arrived on 4/11.  Al-Kitbi </p><p>said that the RCA is in the process of loading </p><p>supplies for a third shipment to Umm Qasr. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Although Al-Kitbi is pleased that the RCA is </p><p>aiding the Shi\'ite Muslims in southern Iraq, she noted </p><p>that the Red Crescent must assist all needy Iraqis -- </p><p>including the Sun\'ni and the Kurds.  She reaffirmed </p><p>the RCA\'s desire to airlift supplies to Baghdad, but </p><p>added that the RCA would be prepared to send aid to </p><p>Mosul, as well.  For supplying Baghdad, Al-Kitbi asked </p><p>our opinion of the overland route via Kermanshah in </p><p>Iran.  She said the Iranian Red Crescent has invited </p><p>the RCA to fly into Kermanshah and will waive any fees </p><p>or tariffs incurred during the transport of the cargo </p><p>to Iraq.  Econoff later informed Al-Kitbi that the </p><p>Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) in Kuwait said </p><p>the overland route from Iran is feasible, and noted </p><p>that the ICRC and the UN currently truck supplies to </p><p>Baghdad via Kermanshah. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment:  Al-Kitbi undertook to inform us when </p><p>the RCA initiates a third shipment to Umm Qasr, or </p><p>transports humanitarian supplies to Kermanshah and </p><p>overland to Baghdad.  We will inform the HOC and </p><p>CENTCOM of these RCA operations when we receive the </p><p>details.  Subsequent to our meeting with Al-Kitbi, we </p><p>were apprised that Baghdad International Airport is </p><p>now open to humanitarian flights.  We have passed this </p><p>welcome news, plus details on modalities for securing </p><p>clearances, to the RCA.  We expect that we will </p><p>shortly receive requests to facilitate flights into </p><p>Baghdad, and will work closely with the HOC to obtain </p><p>clearances for the RCA to deliver humanitarian </p><p>supplies via charter or UAE military aircraft.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
