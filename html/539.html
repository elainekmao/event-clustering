<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KHARTOUM 07039 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KISL, SU </p><p>SUBJECT:  SUDAN\'S TURABI ON "INTERNATIONALISM OF </p><p>          ISLAM," AL BASHIR ON "A NATION OF MESSAGE" </p><p> </p><p>1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY:  THE LEADER OF SUDAN\'S NATIONAL ISLAMIC </p><p>FRONT SPELLED OUT TO THOUSANDS OF HIS FOLLOWERS HERE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 14TH, THE INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER OF ISLAM </p><p>AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE NEED FOR MUSLIMS TO USE THE </p><p>RELIGION AS A SHIELD AGAINST THE POWER OF THE WEST. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN A LONG SERMON BILLED AS A LECTURE IN THE </p><p>QURAN UNIVERSITY\'S SEMINAR ON THE "INTERNATIONALISM </p><p>OF ISLAM," NIF LEADER DR. HASSAN AL TURABI TOLD AN </p><p>OVERFLOW CROWD THAT ISLAM ENCOMPASSES EVERYTHING IN </p><p>LIFE AND IS A WIDELY SPREADING FAITH ALL OVER THE </p><p>WORLD.  HE SAID MUSLIMS SHOULD PROSELYTIZE WITH </p><p>THEIR RELIGION JUST AS OTHER RELIGIONS PRESENT </p><p>THEMSELVES TO THE MUSLIM WORLD.  HE URGED MUSLIMS TO </p><p>"UNDERSTAND ISLAM PERFECTLY" AND TO WORK FOR UNITY, </p><p>JUST AS HE SAID THE WEST HAS DOING. </p><p> </p><p>4.  TAKING ON THE NEW WORLD ORDER, TURABI TOLD HIS </p><p>AUDIENCE THAT MUSLIMS SHOULD BE MOTIVATED TO </p><p>ESTABLISH AN "ISLAMIC SYSTEM" IN THEIR COUNTRIES </p><p>BECAUSE OF ATTEMPTS BY THE WEST TO "IMPOSE" THE NEW </p><p>WORLD ORDER, ITS OWN SYSTEM, ON THEM.  THE WEST, HE </p><p>SAID, INTENDED TO EXTEND THE NEW WORLD ORDER </p><p>UNIVERSALLY; "NO COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT OR OPTION TO </p><p>APPLY ANOTHER SYSTEM." </p><p> </p><p>5.  TURABI UNLOOSED A STREAM OF CRITICISM OF AMERICA </p><p>AND WESTERN EUROPE.  CALLS FOR DEMOCRACY AND JUSTICE </p><p>WERE HYPERCRITICAL, HE SAID; THE WEST DOES NOT IN </p><p>FACT PRACTICE THESE.  INTERNATIONAL LAW, ITSELF A </p><p>WESTERN CONCEPT, IS APPLIED BY THE WEST ONLY WHEN IT </p><p>SERVES WESTERN ADVANTAGE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  TURABI GAVE FOR AN EXAMPLE THE CASE OF THE </p><p>LIBYANS ACCUSED OF BOMBING PAN AM 103.  THE CASE </p><p>SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF </p><p>JUSTICE BUT THE WEST INSTEAD USED THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH IT "DOMINATES," AS ITS TOOL </p><p>TO PRESS LIBYA.  THE SECURITY COUNCIL, HE </p><p>ELABORATED, HAD "A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE ENGLAND" </p><p>"PRIVILEGED" TO HAVE A PERMANENT SEAT WHILE INDIA </p><p>AND NIGERIA WITH LARGER POPULATIONS DID NOT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  AS HE HAS OFTEN DONE BEFORE, TURABI HEAPED SCORN </p><p>UPON LEADERS OF MUSLIM COUNTRIES WHO "SURRENDER" TO </p><p>THE WEST AND "ABANDON ISLAMIC GUIDANCE."  TURABI </p><p>SAID THESE MEN (HE NAMED NO NAMES) FED FALSE </p><p>INFORMATION TO THE WEST TO "DISFIGURE" ALL ISLAMIC </p><p>MOVEMENTS.  THESE LEADERS, HE SAID, CARE ONLY FOR </p><p>POWER AND POSITION, BOTH OF WHICH THEY WILL LOSE </p><p>WHEN ISLAMIC RULE COMES TO THEIR COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>8.  CALLING ON THE SUDANESE TO LIVE THEIR LIVES IN </p><p>ACCORD WITH ISLAM SO AS TO SERVE AS MODELS FOR </p><p>MUSLIM PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, TURABI CONCLUDED BY </p><p>WARNING ALL MUSLIM NATIONS TO APPLY ISLAM AS A </p><p>SYSTEM TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST THE NEW WORLD </p><p>ORDER AND THE UNITY OF THE WEST. </p><p> </p><p>9.  DOUBTLESS TAKING HIS CUE FROM DR. TURABI, </p><p>SUDAN\'S PRESIDENT, LT. GEM. OMAR HASSAN AL BASHIR IN </p><p>A SERIES OF SPEECHES FOLLOWING THE </p><p>"INTERNATIONALISM" SEMINAR, SOUNDED CONVERGENT </p><p>THEMES.  TO A MASS RALLY OF STUDENTS ON THE 15TH, AL </p><p>BASHIR SAID SUDAN\'S REVOLUTION SOUGHT TO "UNLEASH </p><p>THE ENERGIES OF THE SUDANESE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY </p><p>WILL BE A SOURCE OF VIGOR AND POWER TO ALL THE </p><p>OPPRESSED PEOPLES ON THE EARTH."  THE SUDANESE, </p><p>ASSERTED AL BASHIR, ARE AN EXAMPLE TO BE FOLLOWED BY </p><p>THE OPPRESSED COUNTRIES AND "A NATION OF MESSAGE." </p><p> </p><p>10.  ON THE 20TH, TO A QURAN FESTIVAL, AL BASHIR </p><p>CALLED FOR "STRENGTHENING TIES BETWEEN ISLAMIC </p><p>PEOPLES SO AS TO SPOIL THE INTRIGUES PLANNED AGAINST </p><p>THE ISLAMIC PEOPLES BY THE POWERS OF AGGRESSION AND </p><p>ATHEISM."  CITING THE WEST\'S INDIFFERENCE TO THE </p><p>SUFFERING OF MUSLIMS IN BOSNIA AND HERCEGOVINA, </p><p>IRAQ, LIBYA AND SOMALIA, HE SAID THESE COUNTRIES\' </p><p>SITUATIONS REVEAL "INTRIGUES AGAINST ISLAM AND THE </p><p>MUSLIMS," ALL BEING "WITNESSED BY THE NEW WORLD </p><p>ORDER." </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT: TURABI\'S THEMES, AND THEIR FAITHFUL </p><p>ECHO IN THE PRESIDENT\'S REMARKS, ARE NOT NEW.  NOR </p><p>IS TURABI\'S PREFERRED ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL IMAM. </p><p>HIS SERMONISING STYLE SUITS THOSE SUDANESE, WHO, </p><p>LIKE SOME OTHER FUNDAMENTALISTS, ENJOY A ROUSING </p><p>PREACHER GOING AFTER SIN AND THE WORKS OF THE </p><p>DEVIL.  AL BASHIR, NO ORIGINAL THINKER, BUT A USEFUL </p><p>SIDE-MAN FOR AMPLIFYING A THEME, ADDS HIS PART.  BUT </p><p>TURABI\'S MESSAGE IS NOT BENIGN AND THE DEVIL HE IS </p><p>ATTACKING IS US. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PETTERSON </p><p></p></div>
