<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KUALA LUMPUR 004130 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: (OCTOBER 20, 2007) </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MY </p><p>SUBJECT: MAHATHIR FEUDING WITH ISLAMIC CONSERVATIVES </p><p> </p><p>1. CLASSIFIED BY JOHN R. MALOTT, AMBASSADOR.  REASON: </p><p>1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY.  AS MALAYSIA\'S CURRENCY HAS TUMBLED AND </p><p>ITS SKIES HAVE FILLED WITH HAZE, PM MAHATHIR HAS STILL </p><p>FOUND TIME FOR A NASTY DISPUTE WITH ISLAMIC </p><p>CONSERVATIVES.  RECENT ACTIONS BY ZEALOUS RELIGIOUS </p><p>OFFICIALS LED THE PM TO ANNOUNCE A PLAN TO UNIFY SYARIAH </p><p>LAW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL (STRIPPING POWER FROM STATE </p><p>RELIGIOUS OFFICIALS) AND TO CALL PUBLICLY FOR A MORE </p><p>MODERATE, MODERN ISLAM.  OUTRAGED MOSLEM CLERICS HAVE </p><p>CIRCULATED ANONYMOUS LITERATURE ATTACKING THE PM AND THE </p><p>RULING PARTY AND HAVE CRITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT IN FRIDAY </p><p>SERMONS.  THE PROMINENT MUFTI OF SELANGOR STATE EVEN </p><p>CALLED MAHATHIR AN APOSTATE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS REACTED </p><p>BY SACKING THE MUFTI, WARNING OTHER ISLAMIC LEADERS, AND </p><p>CURTAILING OPEN DISTRIBUTION OF ISLAMIC OPPOSITION PARTY </p><p>LITERATURE.  THE WIDER MALAY COMMUNITY SHARES SOME OF THE </p><p>CLERICS\' CONCERNS, THOUGH FAR LESS ACUTELY; WOMEN </p><p>ACTIVISTS SEEM TO BE THE SOLE MOSLEM CONSTITUENCY </p><p>SQUARELY BACKING THE PM.  DESPITE MAHATHIR\'S BIZARRE </p><p>OUTBURSTS AGAINST "THE WEST" DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, </p><p>IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING THE PM ADVOCATES A VERSION OF </p><p>ISLAM THAT SERVES U.S. INTERESTS IN MALAYSIA AND IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC COMMUNITY.  IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER </p><p>MAHATHIR\'S HEIR APPARENT, DEPUTY PM ANWAR, WHO IS SO </p><p>REASONABLE ON MANY ISSUES, HAS THE POLITICAL POSITION OR </p><p>THE DESIRE TO TAKE ON MOSLEM CONSERVATISM AS VIGOROUSLY </p><p>AS MAHATHIR HAS DONE.  IN THE LONG RUN, THE GROWING </p><p>PROPORTION OF  MALAYS IN  MALAYSIA\'S ETHNIC  MIX WILL </p><p>PROBABLY LEAD INEXORABLY TO THE FURTHER ISLAMIZATION OF </p><p>MALAYSIAN SOCIETY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MAHATHIR ATTACKS CONSERVATIVE ISLAM </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) PM MAHATHIR, LIKE MANY OTHER WESTERN-EDUCATED </p><p>MALAYS OF HIS GENERATION, IS AN OBSERVING MOSLEM WITH A </p><p>MODERATE, LARGELY SECULAR WORLD VIEW.  SEVERAL INCIDENTS </p><p>INVOLVING ZEALOUS ISLAMIC AUTHORITIES HAVE ANGERED THE PM </p><p>OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS.  IN JULY, A UNIT OF THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION PROPOSED MAKING THE STUDY OF </p><p>"ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION" COMPULSORY FOR ALL STUDENTS, </p><p>INCLUDING NON-MALAYS (IN MALAYSIA, MALAYS ARE NEARLY ALL </p><p>MOSLEMS AND, EXCEPT FOR SOME INDIAN MOSLEMS, NON-MALAYS </p><p>ARE NEARLY ALL NON-MOSLEMS).  AFTER PROTESTS (AND THE </p><p>PM\'S INTERVENTION), THE REQUIRED COURSE WAS BROADENED TO </p><p>"ASIAN CIVILIZATION."  IN AUGUST, SELANGOR STATE </p><p>RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES LED THREE MALAY WOMEN AWAY IN </p><p>HANDCUFFS FOR TAKING PART IN A BEAUTY PAGEANT, ATTRACTING </p><p>THE ATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS.  ALSO IN </p><p>AUGUST, SARAWAK ISLAMIC AUTHORITIES WARNED SEVERAL MALAY </p><p>MEN NOT TO TAKE PART IN A BODYBUILDING COMPETITION THAT </p><p>INCLUDED POSING IN BRIEF OUTFITS.  THE BODYBUILDERS </p><p>IGNORED THIS WARNING AND NEVER RECEIVED PUNISHMENT, </p><p>HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AFTER THE MESSY BEAUTY CONTEST INCIDENT, THE PM </p><p>SAID THAT BY EARLY 1998 THE GOVERNMENT WOULD UNIFY </p><p>SYARIAH LAW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THUS SHARPLY CURBING THE </p><p>AUTONOMY OF LOCAL RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES.  THE PM SAID </p><p>VARYING STATE INTERPRETATIONS OF ISLAMIC LAW "CONFUSED </p><p>THE PEOPLE" AND ORDERED ALL ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES </p><p>SUSPENDED PENDING THE REVIEW OF STATE LAWS.  HE ALSO </p><p>ORDERED STATE MUFTIS TO REVIEW ALL PROPOSED DECREES WITH </p><p>AN ADVISORY PANEL THAT MUST INCLUDE WOMEN </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES.  THEORETICALLY, THE GOVERNMENT\'S PLAN </p><p>FOR STANDARDIZATION OF SYARIAH LAW WILL REQUIRE THE </p><p>AGREEMENT OF THE STATES\' RULING SULTANS, BUT SUCH </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL NICETIES HAVE RARELY DELAYED THE PM </p><p>BEFORE.  THE "UNIFICATION" OF SYARIAH LAW EARLY NEXT YEAR </p><p>IS ALREADY A FAIT ACCOMPLI AND CONSERVATIVE CLERICS KNOW </p><p>IT, BUT DON\'T LIKE IT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IN EARLY SEPTEMBER, MAHATHIR UNEXPECTEDLY TOOK UP </p><p>THE ISLAMIC ISSUE IN HIS KEYNOTE SPEECH AT THE UMNO </p><p>(MALAYSIA\'S RULING PARTY) GENERAL ASSEMBLY.  IN HIS </p><p>SPEECH, MAHATHIR CALLED ON MALAYS TO REJECT EXTREMISM AND </p><p>NOTED THE RESULTS OF SECTARIAN VIOLENCE IN BOSNIA AND THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST.  HE SAID MOSLEMS NEEDED TO MODERNIZE THEIR </p><p>BELIEFS AND PRACTICES IN ACCORD WITH THE CHANGED </p><p>CONDITIONS OF MODERN LIFE.  HE ALSO CRITICIZED MOSLEMS </p><p>WHO PUT MORE STOCK IN OUTWARD APPEARANCES (SUCH AS </p><p>TRADITIONAL CLOTHES AND BEARDS FOR MEN AND HEADSCARVES </p><p>FOR WOMEN) THAN IN LEADING A MORAL LIE.  SUCH A SPEECH </p><p>MIGHT SOUND SENSIBLE ENOUGH TOWESTERN EARS, BUT BY ALL </p><p>ACCOUNTS IT WAS A DISASER WITH THE LARGELY MALAY </p><p>AUDIENCE (MANY OF THE EN IN WHICH, INCLUDING DEPUTY PM </p><p>ANWAR, SPORTING RADITIONAL DRESS AND GOATEES AND MOST OF </p><p>THE WOMN, INCLUDING ANWAR\'S WIFE, WEARING HEADSCARVES). </p><p>PRESS COMMENT AND PUBLICDISCUSSION OF THE KEYNOTE </p><p>SPEECH, IN PREVIOUS YEARS A PROMINENT ITEM OF PULIC </p><p>DEBATE, WAS VIRTUALLY NIL.  UMNO MEMBERS QUOTED IN THE </p><p>PRESS WERE NON-COMMITTAL, WITH ONE SAYIG ONLY THAT THE </p><p>TOPIC REQUIRED SERIOUS THOUGHT. AS ONE ANALYST SAID, NO </p><p>ONE BUT MAHATHIR WOULD DRE TOUCH SUCH A SUBJECT. </p><p> </p><p>CONSERVATIVES COUNTER-TTACK </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) UNLIKE UMNO MEMBERS, SOME CONSERVATIVES DID NOT </p><p>HESITTE TO EXPRESS THEIR OUTRAGE OVER MAHATHIR\'S ATTACK </p><p>ON "EXTREMIST" ISLAM.  MALAYSIA\'S SOLE ISLAMIC PPOSITION </p><p>PARTY, PAS, ISSUED A POINT FOR POINT REBUTTAL ON ITS WEB </p><p>SITE AND IN THE PARTY NEWSPAPER.  THE PAS PARTY NEWSPAPER </p><p>ALSO DROPPED A BOMBSHELL BY REPORTING THAT THE PROMINENT </p><p>MUFTI OF SELANGOR STATE HAD CALLED MAHATHIR AN APOSTATE. </p><p>THOUGH THE MUFTI LATER DENIED THE REPORT, MANY (SECOND </p><p>HAND) SOURCES CLAIM THE QUOTATION WAS ACCURATE.  ONE </p><p>SOURCE NOTED THAT THE SELANGOR MUFTI NOW GETS A WARM </p><p>RECEPTION WHEN HE VISITS RELIGIOUS LEADERS THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  REPORTEDLY, FRIDAY SERMONS AT MANY MOSQUES HAVE </p><p>INCLUDED BOTH OBLIQUE AND DIRECT CRITICISM OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THE POLICE CONFIRMED PUBLICLY THAT ANONYMOUS </p><p>"POISON PEN" LITERATURE CRITICIZING THE PM IS CIRCULATING </p><p>AT MOSQUES. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT TIGHTENS SCREWS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) THE GOVERNMENT HAS RESPONDED FIRMLY TO AGITATION </p><p>BY RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES.  AFTER THE APOSTATE REPORT, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED IT WOULD ENFORCE A PREVIOUSLY </p><p>IGNORED BAN ON STREET SALES OF THE PAS NEWSPAPER (UNDER </p><p>MALAYSIAN LAW PARTY PUBLICATIONS MAY ONLY BE DISTRIBUTED </p><p>TO PARTY MEMBERS).  MAHATHIR SAID "SINCE WE FIND THE </p><p>TABLOID IS LIBELOUS, WE WILL ENFORCE THE BAN </p><p>IMMEDIATELY."  ON OCTOBER 14, GOVERNMENT MINISTER IN THE </p><p>PM\'S DEPARTMENT  ABDUL HAMID OTHMAN WARNED MOSLEM GROUPS </p><p>NOT TO "UNDERMINE THE GOVERNMENT."  HE SAID THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WAS AWARE OF SOME RELIGIOUS LEADERS\' ATTEMPTS </p><p>TO FOMENT TENSION IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS AND WAS </p><p>MONITORING MOSLEM GROUPS.  ON OCTOBER 15, THE UMNO- </p><p>CONTROLLED STATE GOVERNMENT OF SELANGOR ANNOUNCED THE </p><p>TERM OF THE MUFTI OF SELANGOR WOULD NOT BE EXTENDED.  THE </p><p>CHIEF MINISTER OF SELANGOR SAID THE STATE NEEDED A MUFTI </p><p>WHOSE VIEWS "WERE ACCEPTABLE TO ALL."  GRUMBLING IN THE </p><p>RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY LED ABDUL HAMID TO SAY ON OCTOBER 19 </p><p>THAT THE "DECISION IS FINAL" AND WAS TAKEN BECAUSE OF THE </p><p>MUFTI\'S ADVANCED AGE.  THE MINISTER\'S STATEMENT WAS A BIT </p><p>CURIOUS FOR TWO REASONS: 1) CURTAILING OF THE MUFTI\'S </p><p>TERM WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN A STATE, NOT A FEDERAL </p><p>DECISION; AND 2) THE PM HIMSELF HAS REPEATEDLY STATED </p><p>THAT HE WILL NOT STEP DOWN, THOUGH HE IS ONE YEAR OLDER </p><p>THAN THE MUFTI. </p><p> </p><p>VIEWS FROM THE STREET </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) MANY MALAYS, ESPECIALLY IN URBAN AREAS, SYMPATHIZE </p><p>SOMEWHAT WITH THE PM\'S VIEWS ON RELIGIOUS ZEALOTRY.  THE </p><p>BEAUTY PAGEANT CASE STRUCK MANY AS INDEED EXTREME (IT </p><p>TURNED OUT THAT RELIGIOUS POLICE HAD BOUGHT TICKETS TO </p><p>THE SHOW AND EATEN THE DINNER PROVIDED BEFORE SLAPPING </p><p>HANDCUFFS ON THE MALAY WOMEN IN A WAY DESIGNED TO BE </p><p>HUMILIATING).  PROPONENTS OF CONSERVATIVE ISLAM ARE THUS </p><p>A VOCAL MINORITY, THOUGH WITH SUBSTANTIAL RESERVOIRS OF </p><p>SUPPORT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, ON THE EAST COAST, AND AMONG </p><p>SOME POCKETS OF RELIGIOUS URBAN DWELLERS.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>MAHATHIR\'S REMARKS AT THE UMNO GENERAL ASSEMBLY RAISED </p><p>CONCERNS EVEN AMONG MORE SECULARLY MINDED MALAYS.  ONE </p><p>PROMINENT UMNO POLITICIAN ASKED US RHETORICALLY: "WHAT </p><p>WILL THE PM SAY NEXT, THAT WE SHOULD EAT PORK?"  THIS IS </p><p>PERHAPS NOT A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION OF MAHATHIR\'S VIEWS, </p><p>BUT IT SHOWS THE ANXIETY THAT EVEN MODERATES FEEL ABOUT </p><p>THE TONE AND DIRECTION OF HIS IDEAS ON "MODERNIZING" </p><p>ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WOMEN AND ISLAM </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) ISLAMIC WOMEN ACTIVISTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE </p><p>FULLY BEHIND MAHATHIR.  GROUPS LIKE "SISTERS OF ISLAM" </p><p>HAVE LONG BEEN AGITATING FOR MANY OF THE SAME REFORMS </p><p>MAHATHIR HAS PROPOSED.  THE MODERNIZATION OF ISLAMIC </p><p>ATTITUDES TOWARD WOMEN AND THE CREATION OF LEGAL AND </p><p>SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT BETTER PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF </p><p>MOSLEM WOMEN ARE FULLY CONSONANT WITH MAHATHIR\'S IDEAS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) THE PM HAS BEEN ON A VERBAL RAMPAGE LATELY, </p><p>UTTERING BIZARRE REMARKS (LIKE HIS ANTI-SEMITIC COMMENTS </p><p>LAST WEEK) THAT ALMOST SEEM PURPOSELY SELF-DESTRUCTIVE. </p><p>WHILE WE FOCUS ON MAHATHIR\'S ANTI-WESTERN REMARKS, IT IS </p><p>WORTH REMEMBERING THAT MAHATHIR LASHES OUT AGAINST </p><p>ANYTHING HE DOESN\'T LIKE, FROM LITTERBUGS TO "RADICAL </p><p>ISLAM."  HE CONSISTENTLY ADVOCATES A MODERATE ISLAM </p><p>SQUARELY IN LINE WITH U.S. INTERESTS AND VALUES.  THE PM, </p><p>FOR BETTER OR WORSE, IS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON ANYONE, </p><p>INCLUDING CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC GROUPS THAT GENERALLY HAVE </p><p>NEGATIVE VIEWS TOWARD THE U.S.  MAHATHIR IS ALSO </p><p>IMPORTANT AS A VOICE OF MODERATION WITHIN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC COMMUNITY.  THOUGH THE PM\'S HEIR </p><p>APPARENT, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ANWAR, IS THE PM\'S "GOOD </p><p>CONSCIENCE," ANWAR HAS NOT PROVEN HE HAS EITHER THE </p><p>POLITICAL STANDING OR THE DESIRE TO TAKE ON CONSERVATIVE </p><p>ISLAM.  ANWAR STARTED HIS CAREER AS A MOSLEM ACTIVIST AND </p><p>SEEMS LOATH TO CONFRONT HIS FORMER ASSOCIATES.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, ANWAR\'S REACTION TO THE BEAUTY PAGEANT INCIDENT, </p><p>WHICH HAPPENED WHILE THE PM WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND </p><p>ANWAR WAS IN CHARGE, WAS MUCH LESS VIGOROUS.  MOREOVER, </p><p>ANWAR, IF HE DOES BECOME THE NEXT PM, WILL NOT HAVE </p><p>MAHATHIR\'S ALMOST UNQUESTIONED AUTHORITY.  THUS, FOR </p><p>POLITICAL REASONS HE MAY BE RELUCTANT TO TAKE STRONG </p><p>STANDS THAT UPSET THE VOCAL RELIGIOUS CONSTITUENCY. </p><p> </p><p>IN THE LONG RUN ... </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) IN THE LONG RUN DEMOGRAPHICS WILL PROBABLY </p><p>DICTATE AN INCREASED ROLE FOR ISLAM IN MALAYSIA.  MALAYS </p><p>NOW CONSTITUTE 55 PERCENT OF MALAYSIA\'S POPULATION. </p><p>GOVERNMENT PRO-NATALIST POLICIES FOR MALAYS ARE PREDICTED </p><p>TO LEAD TO A 70 PERCENT MALAY MAJORITY BY 2020.  SOME </p><p>ANALYSTS SAY THAT URBANIZATION AND ECONOMIC MODERNIZATION </p><p>WILL LEAD TO AN INCREASINGLY SECULAR MALAY COMMUNITY. </p><p>RECENT EVENTS SHOW THE OPPOSITE ALSO COULD HAPPEN, </p><p>HOWEVER.  AS THE OUTSIDE WORLD IMPINGES ON TRADITIONAL </p><p>MALAY CULTURE, MANY MALAYS SEEM TO BE REACTING BY TURNING </p><p>BACK TO THEIR ISLAMIC ROOTS -- AT LEAST IN EXTERNAL FORMS </p><p>OF OBSERVANCE.  FOR INSTANCE, OVER THE PAST DECADE </p><p>NOTICEABLY MORE MALAY WOMEN NOW WEAR HEADSCARVES.  THIS </p><p>ISLAMIC RESURGENCE, EVEN IN ITS MILD MALAYSIAN FORM, </p><p>WORRIES MALAYSIA\'S NON-MALAY COMMUNITIES.  GIVEN </p><p>POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER </p><p>MAHATHIR\'S SUCCESSOR (WHETHER ANWAR OR SOMEONE ELSE) WILL </p><p>HAVE SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO MAKE SURE DIFFERENCES DO NOT </p><p>GET OUT OF HAND.  WE EXPECT, THEREFORE, ISLAMIC ISSUES </p><p>BECOME TO BECOME MORE PROMINENT IN COMING YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>MALOTT </p><p></p></div>
