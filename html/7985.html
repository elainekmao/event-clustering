<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002788 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON SECSTATE VISIT AND </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S SPEECH </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- The lead story in all papers today, May 11, is </p><p>Secretary Powell\'s visit to Israel and the West Bank. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Reports highlight the fact that the Secretary met with </p><p>Abu Mazen, the new Palestinian Prime Minister, and </p><p>"ignored" Arafat.  All reports also highlight Israel\'s </p><p>rejection of "any withdrawal that would threaten </p><p>security". </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Familiar objectives" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (05/11) editorializes:  "U.S. President </p><p>George Bush\'s initiative for the establishment of a </p><p>free trade area between the United States and the </p><p>Middle East might not be original, but it is timely </p><p>and promising..  Unless solid foundations for peace </p><p>are laid, free market reforms have few chances.  Peace </p><p>remains a prerequisite for development, prosperity and </p><p>stability." </p><p> </p><p>-- "America proposes trade openness o Middle East </p><p>countries" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(05/11), commenting on President Bush\'s May 9 address </p><p>at the South Carolina University:  "The U.S. President </p><p>realizes that America\'s image, as a state biased in </p><p>favor of Israel and against the rights of the </p><p>Palestinian people and as a state occupying a very </p><p>important Arab country, has reached rock-bottom.  Arab </p><p>people must, therefore, be appeased and America\'s </p><p>image must be improved in the Arab public opinion. </p><p>Politically, Bush stressed the need for Israel to deal </p><p>with the Palestinians with dignity and respect, to </p><p>stop the settlements and to accept the concept of two </p><p>states in accordance with roadmap.  This is firm </p><p>language that the Arab side would welcome if it is </p><p>followed by action.  Economically, Bush presented a </p><p>grand project for establishing a free trade area </p><p>between the Middle East and America.  This is the </p><p>first step towards reshaping the map of the Middle </p><p>East..  If the American President wants to bribe the </p><p>Arabs, then finding a just solution to the Palestinian </p><p>cause is the way to do that." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Who believes that Powell would succeed" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(05/11):  "Very few Arabs would wager on the success </p><p>of Secretary of State Powell\'s visit to Tel Aviv.. </p><p>The bitter reality in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict </p><p>remains as is.  The reason for that is not the </p><p>brutishness of the rulers of Israel and their </p><p>legendary steadfastness in the face of pressures, but </p><p>because these pressures never really paralleled the </p><p>task, namely ending a 36-year-old occupation, and </p><p>never compared with the daily crimes that were </p><p>committed by this occupation against the Palestinian </p><p>people.  In short, the Americans did nothing for the </p><p>Palestinian cause when they were miles away.  So why </p><p>would they do anything now when they are occupying and </p><p>controlling the largest and strongest Arab country. </p><p>We are going to hear how Sharon fought off Powell\'s </p><p>pressures, and how Bush plans to receive Sharon to </p><p>exercise more pressure on him.  Many Arabs will </p><p>believe that.  Yet, the fact remains: the occupation </p><p>is stands with its daily killings and degradation of </p><p>the Palestinians and the Arab nation.  Talk of </p><p>expected American pressures on Israel to accept the </p><p>roadmap without amendments is a joke." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Dr. George Bush" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Basem Sakijha writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(05/11):  "The speech of President Bush at the South </p><p>Carolina University may well be the clearest in </p><p>declaring the American commitment to the political </p><p>plan vis--vis the Middle East.  He speaks of two </p><p>states, a Palestinian state and an Israeli state.  He </p><p>focuses on democracy in the region.  He paves the way </p><p>for Secretary Powell\'s regional trip.  This </p><p>straightforward declaration coincides with talk about </p><p>economic partnership..  Language used in Bush\'s speech </p><p>seems to be more firm when it comes to what is </p><p>required from Israel.  This is new.  Yet, the region </p><p>will continue to doubtful of American declarations and </p><p>announcements until it sees implementation on the </p><p>ground.  Everyone is convinced that without American </p><p>pressure on Tel Aviv, the current situation would </p><p>continue to prevail." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
