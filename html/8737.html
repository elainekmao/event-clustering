(U) Summary and comment.  UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA) </p><p>Secretary General Sana\'a Al-Kitbi forwarded to Econoff 6/15 a </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>retrospective on the RCA\'s work in Iraq from the present </p><p>until shortly before the war began.  The RCA has contributed more </p><p>than USD $18 million in humanitarian supplies and services to the </p><p>people of Iraq since November 2002, and continues to answer the </p><p>Humanitarian Operations Center\'s appeals for emergency assistance. </p><p>The RCA is forging ahead with is major hospital refurbishment </p><p>program in Iraq, and has agreed to accept more Iraqi children for </p><p>medical treatment in the UAE.  We expect the final price tag for </p><p>RCA humanitarian assistance programs in Iraq to far exceed the </p><p>USD $18 million already spent. </p><p>End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>Phase I: Pre-War Stockpiling, $826,000 </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) A few months prior to the war in Iraq, and in response to </p><p>appeals from the ICRC and the Iraqi Red Crescent Society, the </p><p>UAE RCA sent four delegations between November 2002 and April </p><p>2003 to help build emergency stockpiles of food and medical </p><p>supplies in Iraq.  The RCA delegations purchased these products </p><p>from the local economy, and either warehoused the goods or </p><p>distributed them to hospitals and villages through existing United </p><p>Nations distribution networks.  The value of this </p><p>pre-war mission totaled about USD $826,000. </p><p> </p><p>Phase II: Emergency Humanitarian Aid, $5.5 Million </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) During and directly after the war, the RCA shipped </p><p>more than 1700 tons of medical equipment and supplies, food </p><p>parcels, dates, tents, emergency vehicles and four water tankers </p><p>to Iraq in two separate shipments to Umm Qasr.  The RCA </p><p>dispatched by road from Kuwait, Jordan, and Turkey 55 trucks of </p><p>approximately 1100 tons of basic foodstuffs, shoes and clothing, </p><p>mattresses, pillows, and blankets to Iraq.  The UAEG also donated </p><p>three heavy trucks to aid other NGOs in Iraq with the </p><p>distribution of their assistance.  More than 250 tons of dates </p><p>were sent to Iraq by air from the UAE once military aircraft were </p><p>permitted to land in Basrah and Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The RCA also contributed thousands of dollars to </p><p>rebuilding the infrastructure in southern Iraq.  The RCA built </p><p>a water treatment plant with 200,000-gallon capacity in Basrah, </p><p>and has begun construction of three other water treatment plants </p><p>with 25,000-gallon capacity in the surrounding areas. </p><p>The RCA also donated a generator for the Saba Nissan water station </p><p>on the Tigris river that provides clean water to </p><p>approximately 1.5 million people.  The RCA likewise </p><p>identified and refurbished an office in Iraq from which ICRC staff </p><p>could operate, and donated to the ICRC a refrigerated truck for </p><p>use in its medical logistic operations in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) In the UAE, the RCA provided emergency food and shelter to </p><p>hundreds of Iraqis who were stranded in Dubai at the onset of </p><p>the war in Iraq.  The stranded Iraqis remained in Dubai until the </p><p>beginning of June, at which time the RCA paid for </p><p>the Iraqis to return to Iraq overland via Jordan.  This second </p><p>phase of humanitarian assistance in Iraq cost the RCA more than </p><p>USD $5.5 million. </p><p> </p><p>Phase III: Air Bridge, $1.6 Million And Counting </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>6.  (U) As reported reftel, the RCA began an "air bridge" of </p><p>humanitarian flights to Baghdad, Basrah, and Mosul on 4/27 </p><p>to support Iraqi hospitals and dispatch about 255 </p><p>tons of medicines, medical items, children\'s nutrients and </p><p>other necessities.  As of 6/3, the RCA had sponsored 17 such </p><p>flights at a cost of more than USD $1.6 million. </p><p>Post receives notification from the RAMCC that these RCA flights </p><p>to Iraq continue on an almost daily basis. </p><p> </p><p>Phase IV: Hospital Renovation, $10.8 Million </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) In May, the RCA began the complete renovation and </p><p>refurbishment of six hospitals in Iraq.  A UAE medical team headed </p><p>this effort, and remains in Iraq to manage the administration of the </p><p>Shaykh Zayid Hospital in Baghdad -- which the RCA rehabilitated in </p><p>April.  The RCA\'s hospital rehabilitation program has </p><p>cost nearly USD $10.8 million to date. </p><p> </p><p>Phase V: Treatment Of Wounded Iraqis...Priceless </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The RCA has not yet estimated the total cost of </p><p>evacuating in May nearly 40 wounded children and their parents </p><p>to the UAE for medical treatment. The Humanitarian Operations </p><p>Center (HOC) in Kuwait asked the RCA to arrange for and </p><p>cover all costs associated with the special medical evacuation </p><p>flights -- the first of which was a presidential Amiri flight -- </p><p>accommodations and food for the parents while in the UAE, all </p><p>related medical treatment and rehabilitation, and a return </p><p>trip home once the patients have recovered.  Requests from the HOC </p><p>continue, and the UAE may accept up to 25 additional patients </p><p>identified by the HOC as requiring medical treatment available </p><p>in the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The RCA also is seeking more advanced medical treatment </p><p>in the United States for one of the Iraqi patients, and is </p><p>likely to cover the child\'s hospital costs and travel expenses. </p><p>While at this point the total cost for medical treatment for these </p><p>Iraqi patients is unknown, we estimate it is in the range of </p><p>several million dollars. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
