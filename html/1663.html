(U) CLASSIFIED BY ECONOMIC COUNSELOR ROBERT W. </p><p>DRY, REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY: RECENT CONGRESSIONAL VISITS TO </p><p>VIETNAM GAVE HIGH PRIORITY TO LABOR ISSUES.  IN </p><p>MEETINGS WITH VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS AND THE ILO, THE </p><p>VISITORS HEARD WHAT VIETNAM IS DOING TO MOVE FORWARD </p><p>IN WORKERS RIGHTS AND WHAT MORE VIETNAM PLANS FOR THIS </p><p>AREA.  SEVERAL STAFFERS SYMPATHETIC TO THE LINKAGE OF </p><p>LABOR OBLIGATIONS AND TRADE AGREEMENTS FOCUSED ON </p><p>DEVELOPING IDEAS ON HOW THIS MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE CONTEXT.  THEY LEARNED FROM THEIR </p><p>DISCUSSIONS THAT ANY SUCH EFFORTS WOULD BE A </p><p>DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, UNDERTAKING WHICH WOULD </p><p>LIKELY JEOPARDIZE VIETNAM\'S PROGRESS ON TRADE </p><p>LIBERALIZATION AND OUR ABILITY TO MOVE THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>FORWARD ON LABOR ISSUES IN THE CHANNELS WE CURRENTLY </p><p>HAVE.  NONETHELESS, WE FOUND LISTENING TO THEIR </p><p>CONCERNS USEFUL.  ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ARE A BIT </p><p>CONCERNED HOW THE GVN WILL INTERPRET THIS RATHER </p><p>CANDID DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEED FOR LABOR PROGRESS BY </p><p>CERTAIN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.  THE GVN\'S GOAL IS TO SEE </p><p>THE BTA RATIFIED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE.  THE </p><p>LABOR DISCUSSION MAY HAVE FURTHER HEIGHTENED ANXIETY </p><p>ABOUT THE TIMING OF BTA RATIFICATION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) POST HOSTED A VISIT BY REP. PHILIP CRANE (R- </p><p>IL) APRIL 10-15 AND A STAFF DELEGATION LED BY EARNEST </p><p>"CHUCK" CHARLES ATKINS, CHIEF OF STAFF FOR REP. BART </p><p>GORDON (D-TN) APRIL 15-19.  DURING BOTH OF THESE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01026  031511Z </p><p>VISITS, LABOR ISSUES AND WORKERS\' RIGHTS WERE GIVEN </p><p>HIGH PRIORITY.  (SEE SEPTELS FOR OTHER REPORTS ON THE </p><p>DELEGATIONS\' VISITS.)  VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS RESPONDED </p><p>BY ARRANGING SURPRISINGLY HIGH LEVEL MEETINGS GIVEN </p><p>THAT MOST SENIOR OFFICIALS WERE THEN DEEPLY INVOLVED </p><p>IN IMPORTANT MEETINGS IN THE RUN-UP TO THE NINTH PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS.  REP. CRANE AND HIS DELEGATION MET WITH THE </p><p>FIRST VICE MINISTER FROM THE MINISTRY OF LABOR, </p><p>INVALIDS AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS (MOLISA) MR. NGUYEN LUONG </p><p>TRAO, AS WELL AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE ILO HANOI OFFICE, </p><p>MS. ROSEMARIE GREVE.  INTERESTED MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>STAFFDEL ALSO MET WITH MR. TRAO AND MS. GREVE.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THEY MET WITH VICE CHAIRMAN DR. DANG NGOC </p><p>CHIEN OF THE VIETNAM GENERAL CONFERDERATION OF LABOR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE DELEGATION MEMBERS THAT TOOK THE </p><p>GREATEST INTEREST IN THE WORKERS RIGHTS TOPIC WERE </p><p>STAFFDEL MEMBER MR. TIM REIF, DEMOCRATIC CHIEF TRADE </p><p>COUNSEL, AND CODEL MEMBER MS. VIJI RANGASWAMI, </p><p>DEMOCRATIC TRADE COUNSEL, BOTH OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND </p><p>MEANS COMMITTEE.  BOTH WERE ATTEMPTING TO GATHER </p><p>INFORMATION TO SUPPORT A PLAN TO LINK PASSAGE OF THE </p><p>BTA TO VIETNAMESE AGREEMENT TO NEGOITATE A DOCUMENT, </p><p>PREFERABLY A TEXTILES AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD OBLIGATE </p><p>VIETNAM TO IMPROVE ITS PROTECTION FOR WORKER RIGHTS, </p><p>THEREBY BRINGING IT MORE CLOSELY INTO LINE WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS.  MS. RANGASWAMI TOLD </p><p>POST\'S LABOR OFFICER PRIOR TO EMBASSY\'S COUNTRY TEAM </p><p>MEETING, THE OPENING EVENT OF MR. CRANE\'S VISIT, THAT </p><p>HER GOAL WAS TO \'FIND A SOLUTION\' TO THE VIETNAM </p><p>\'LABOR ISSUE\' DURING THE TRIP. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01026  031511Z </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) MS. ANGELA ELLARD, STAFF DIRECTOR FOR THE </p><p>WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE, ALSO PARTICIPATED ACTIVELY </p><p>IN THE LABOR-ORIENTED PORTION OF THE SCHEDULE, SHAPING </p><p>QUESTIONS THAT DREW ATTENTION TO WHAT THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>WERE DOING THEMSELVES TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THIS AREA, </p><p>AS WELL AS THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE UNDER OUR </p><p>BILATERAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU)ON LABOR </p><p>COOPERATION AND DIALOGUE.  IN THE MEETING WITH MOLISA </p><p>VICE MINISTER TRAO, SHE SAID THAT MEMBERS BELIEVED THE </p><p>MOU WAS AN "EXCELLENT BASIS FOR MOVING FORWARD ON </p><p>LABOR ISSUES".  MIKE MESSMER, STAFFER FOR RICHARD </p><p>GEPHARDT (D-MO), ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE STAFFDEL\'S </p><p>LABOR MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) WE THOUGHT BOTH MEETINGS WITH MOLISA VICE </p><p>MINISTER TRAO WENT WELL.  AFTER BRIEF INTRODUCTORY </p><p>REMARKS, TRAO INVITED THE VISITORS TO POSE QUESTIONS. </p><p>AFTER LISTENING TO A SERIES OF QUESTIONS, HE DEFTLY </p><p>ADDRESSED THEM WHILE PROVIDING INSIGHT INTO THE GVN\'S </p><p>EFFORTS TO REFORM AND IMPROVE THE LABOR LAW AND </p><p>WORKERS PROTECTIONS.  IT WAS CLEAR FROM HIS </p><p>PRESENTATION THAT, WITH OVER A MILLION NEW ENTRANTS </p><p>INTO THE JOB MARKET ANNUALLY, HIS GOVERNMENT GAVE TOP </p><p>PRIORITY TO EMPLOYMENT GENERATION.  BUT, HE ALSO MADE </p><p>IT CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT TOOK AN INTEREST IN THE </p><p>QUALITY OF THOSE JOBS AND IN THE MANNER WORKERS WERE </p><p>TREATED ON THE JOB.  HE TOLD BOTH DELEGATIONS THAT THE </p><p>GVN WAS CIRCULATING FOR COMMENT DRAFT AMENDMENTS TO </p><p>THE LABOR CODE WHICH WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW TO </p><p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN MAY.  AND, IF ALL GOES WELL, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 05        HANOI  01026  031511Z </p><p>IT WOULD BE SUBMITTED FOR FINAL ASSEMBLY APPROVAL BY </p><p>MAY 2002.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT VIETNAM WAS AN ILO </p><p>MEMBER, HAD RATIFIED 15 CONVENTIONS, THREE OF WHICH </p><p>WERE CORE CONVENTIONS, AND THAT VIETNAM PLANNED TO </p><p>RATIFY TWO ADDITIONAL CONVENTIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE, </p><p>INCLUDING CORE CONVENTION NO. 138 ON THE MINIMUM AGE </p><p>FOR WORK.  MOREOVER, HE SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WAS FULLY </p><p>AWARE OF THE NEED TO STUDY RATIFICATION OF THE </p><p>REMAINING CORE CONVENTIONS AND, WHERE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS NOT YET IN COMPLIANCE, TO BEGIN INCORPORATING THEIR </p><p>OBLIGATIONS INTO THE DOMESTIC LABOR SYSTEM.  TRAO </p><p>SPOKE HIGHLY OF INITIAL PROGRESS UNDER THE U.S.- </p><p>VIETNAM MOU AND SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT LOOKED </p><p>FORWARD TO THE COMPLETION OF THE SPECIFIC PROJECT </p><p>PROPOSALS DEVELOPED IN MARCH (REF) THAT WOULD BREATHE </p><p>LIFE INTO THE PROJECT PLAN. HE STRESSED HIS </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE "COOPERATIVE APPROACH" ON LABOR </p><p>ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) IN THE STAFFDEL MEETING WITH TRAO, TIM REIF </p><p>NOTED THAT THE U.S. HAD INCLUDED LANGUAGE ON TRADE AND </p><p>LABOR STANDARDS IN RECENT TRADE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING </p><p>THE FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH JORDAN AND THE TEXTILES </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH CAMBODIA.  HE ADDED THAT MANY MEMBERS - </p><p>NAMING CHARLES RANGEL (D-NY) AND GEPHARDT, </p><p>SPECIFICALLY - EXPECT THAT ONE OF THESE WILL SERVE AS </p><p>A MODEL FOR "HOW WE DEAL WITH THE LABOR STANDARDS </p><p>ISSUE WITH VIETNAM."  FURTHERMORE, HE SUGGESTED IN </p><p>THIS MEETING AND OTHERS THAT RESOLUTION OF LABOR </p><p>ISSUES WAS REQUIRED BEFORE THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL </p><p>TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA) WOULD BE SENT TO THE HILL FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 06        HANOI  01026  031511Z </p><p>APPROVAL (SIC).  TRAO EXPRESSED GRATITUDE FOR MEMBERS\' </p><p>FOCUS ON VIETNAM\'S LABOR REGIME.  BUT, HE SAID HE WAS </p><p>SURE THAT WHEN MEMBERS AND THEIR STAFF STUDIED </p><p>VIETNAM\'S "PROGRESSIVE" LABOR CODE THEY WOULD BE </p><p>CONVINCED TO SUPPORT THE BTA.  HE PLEDGED TO WORK WITH </p><p>THE U.S. TO PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT WAS NEEDED ON </p><p>VIETNAM\'S LABOR REGIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE VOTE ON </p><p>THE BTA\'S PASSAGE IN CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) AFTER THE MEETING, KEY MOLISA CONTACT NGUYEN </p><p>MANH CUONG (PLEASE PROTECT) REMARKED PRIVATELY TO </p><p>ECONOFF THAT TRAO\'S REMARKS WERE INTENDED TO CONVEY </p><p>THE MESSAGE THAT THE GVN WOULD NOT AGREE TO CHANGES IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S LABOR REGIME AS CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL OF </p><p>THE BTA.  FURTHER, HE WARNED THAT, IN HIS OPINION, ANY </p><p>LINKAGE OF LABOR TO ANY FUTURE TRADE AGREEMENT, </p><p>INCLUDING THE TEXTILES AGREEMENT, WOULD BE </p><p>"IMPOSSIBLE" AND MIGHT JEOPARDIZE NOT ONLY CONCLUSION </p><p>OF THAT AGREEMENT BUT ALSO VIETNAM\'S OWN APPORVAL OF </p><p>THE BTA.  EVEN WORSE, HE FEARED THAT SUCH ACTION MIGHT </p><p>INDUCE A DECISION TO SLOW OR HALT THE COOPERATION ON </p><p>LABOR ALREADY UNDERWAY. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) ILO HANOI DIRECTOR GREVE BRIEFED THE </p><p>DELEGATIONS ON THE ILO\'S VIEWS ON VIETNAM\'S LABOR </p><p>REGIME AND THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE ORGANIZATION </p><p>IS UNDERTAKING.  SHE ADMITTED CANDIDLY THAT VIETNAM\'S </p><p>LABOR REGIME FELL SHORT OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR </p><p>STANDARDS BUT ASSERTED THAT VIETNAM HAD MADE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN IMPROVING COMPLIANCE SINCE RE- </p><p>JOINING THE ILO IN 1992.  MOREOVER, SHE SAID THAT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 07        HANOI  01026  031511Z </p><p>COUNTRY WAS "COMMITTED" TO GRADUALLY AND DELIBERATELY </p><p>CONTINUING TO BRING LABOR RIGHTS MORE CLOSELY INTO </p><p>COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS.  IN RESPONSE </p><p>TO QUESTIONS ABOUT ADDITIONAL PRIORITY AREAS IN WHICH </p><p>VIETNAM NEEDED AND WAS PREPARED TO ACCEPT ILO </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISINTACE, MS. GREVE LISTED STRENGTHENING </p><p>LABOR STATISTICS AND MARKET INFORMATION AND COLLECTIVE </p><p>BARGAINING, ESPECIALLY AT THE ENTERPRISE LEVEL.  AS </p><p>THE ILO IS NOT A FUNDING AGENCY, SHE NOTED THAT </p><p>FUNDING FOR SUCH PROJECTS MUST COME FROM MULTILATERAL </p><p>OR BILATERAL DONORS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) THE STAFFDEL MEETING WITH VIETNAMSES LABOR </p><p>CONFIDERATION (VGCL) VICE CHAIRMAN CHIEN PROVIDED A </p><p>PICTURE OF HOW THE LABOR CONFEDERATION ENVISIONS ITS </p><p>ROLE AND WHAT IT THINKS ARE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS </p><p>FACING VIETNAMESE WORKERS.  IN HIS REMARKS, CHIEN </p><p>REFLECTED THE VGCL\'S TRADEMARK SCHIZOPHRENIA BETWEEN </p><p> </p><p>OLD ATTITUDES AND METHODS, WHICH CHARACTERIZED TRADE </p><p>UNION ACTIVITY IN VIETNAM\'S COMMAND ECONOMY AND A </p><p>GROWING UNDERSTANDING OF AND DESIRE TO ADAPT THE LABOR </p><p>REGIME TO CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY THE MORE MARKET- </p><p>ORIENTED ECONOMY OF TODAY.  WHEN SPEAKING ABOUT THE </p><p>TRADE UNION\'S ROLE, HE STATED IT IN TERMS OF VGCL\'S </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT THE NATION\'S ECONOMIC GOALS </p><p>OF EXPANDED GROWTH AND JOB CREATION BY "SUPERVISING </p><p>AND REPRESENTING THE INTEREST OF LABORERS." </p><p>NEGOTIATION AND CONCILIATION WITH EMPLOYERS ON THE </p><p>WORKERS BEHALF SYMBOLIZED THE VGCL\'S PREFERRED </p><p>APPROACH TO ADDRESSING LABOR DISPUTES. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 08        HANOI  01026  031511Z </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) HOWEVER, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, CHIEN NOTED </p><p>PROBLEMS THAT FACE WORKERS AND BY EXTENSION THE VGCL, </p><p>ESPECIALLY, HE CLAIMED, IN FOREIGN-INVESTED </p><p>ENTERPRISES (FIE\'S).  SOME EMPLOYERS FAVOR SHORT-TERM </p><p>CONTRACTS EVEN WHEN THE WORKERS ARE CLEARLY LONG-TERM </p><p>EMPLOYEES.  SOME EXPECT WORKERS TO WORK MORE OVERTIME </p><p>THAN THE 200 HOURS/YEAR PERMITTED UNDER THE LABOR CODE </p><p>THEREBY FAILING TO CREATE NEW JOBS.  (NB:  THIS </p><p>REQUIREMENT IS FAR BELOW THE ILO/SA8000 STANDARD OF </p><p>600 HOURS/YEAR OVERTIME AND THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS FOR </p><p>ITS REVIEW DURING THE COMMENT PERIOD ON THE DRAFT </p><p>LABOR CODE AMENDMENTS.  IT APPEARS THE INTENT OF </p><p>LIMITING THE NUMBER OF OVERTIME HOURS IS LESS WORKER </p><p>PROTECTION THAN A DESIRE ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>TO FORCE EMPLOYERS TO CREATE MORE JOBS.)  CHIEN NOTED </p><p>CASES EXIST IN WHICH OWNERS AND MANAGERS DISCOURAGED </p><p>THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FORMATION OF UNIONS BY THE </p><p>VGCL IN THEIR ENTERPRISES.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE </p><p>PENALTIES FOR ENTERPRISES THAT VIOLATE THE LABOR CODE </p><p>WERE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO ACT AS A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>DETERRENT.  OTHER PROBLEMS INCLUDED FAILURE TO PAY TET </p><p>HOLIDAY BONUSES, INSUFFICIENT COMPENSATION FOR </p><p>OVERTIME, AND AN UNDULY STRESSFUL WORKLOAD.  (COMMENT: </p><p>THESE SAME PROBLEMS EXIST IN THE DOMESTIC PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR AND, TO SOME EXTENT, IN THE STATE-OWNED </p><p>ENTERPRISES, BUT MANY LABOR OFFICIALS, IN BOTH THE </p><p>VGCL AND MOLISA, TEND TO RAISE THESE ISSUES ONLY IN </p><p>THE CONTEXT OF FIE\'S.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>12  (C) COMMENT: THESE VISITS AFFORDED THE EMBASSY A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 09        HANOI  01026  031511Z </p><p>WELCOME OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH IMPORTANT </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS INVOLVED IN THE DEBATE ON THE </p><p>LABOR DIMENSIONS OF TRADE. SEVERAL OF THESE STAFFERS </p><p>ON BOTH DELEGATIONS SEEMED TO OPERATE UNDER THE </p><p>MIQAKEN ASSUMPTION THAT THE EMBASSY IS IN A POSITION </p><p>TO JOIN IN FORMULATING A LABOR STRATEGY THAT COULD, AT </p><p>LEAST IN PART, BE COMPLETED PRIOR TO A VOTE ON THE </p><p>BTA.  ONE OF THESE STAFFERS CONTINUES TO TELEPHONE </p><p>REGARDING LABOR ISSUES IN VIETNAM.  WE HAVE REPEATEDLY </p><p>MADE IT CLEAR WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE POLICY </p><p>COMMITMENTS; THIS IS NOT OUR ROLE IN THE FIELD. </p><p>RATHER THIS IS A JOB FOR THE ADMINISTRATION, OF WHICH </p><p>WE ARE A VERY SMALL PART.  HOWEVER, WE SHARE WITH </p><p>THESE STAFFERS INTEREST IN ASSURING THAT VIETNAM\'S </p><p>WORKERS ENJOY PROTECTIONS AND THAT THEY WILL NOT </p><p>SUFFER ANY DETERIORATION IN THEIR SITUATION AS A </p><p>RESULT OF THE BTA COMING INTO FORCE.  YET, WE HAVE </p><p>CONSISTENTLY ARGUED THAT TO LINK TRADE BENEFITS TO </p><p>PROGRAM ON LABOR WILL TORPEDO THE BTA AND TRADE </p><p>LIBERALIZATION GENERALLY IN VIETNAM.  THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>WILL NOT STAND FOR IT AND WE THINK VIETNAM\'S SITUATION </p><p>IS SUFFICIENTLY UNIQUE THAT A COOKIE CUTTER TEXTILE </p><p>AGREEMENT MODELED ON THE ONE THE U.S. ENTERED INTO </p><p>WITH CAMBODIA IS THE WRONG APPROACH FOR VIETNAM.  THE </p><p>BILATERAL MOU ON LABOR WITH THE VIETNAMESE IS OFF TO A </p><p>GOOD START.  IF THE ADMINISTRATION DETERMINED THAT </p><p>LABOR RIGHTS IN VIETNAM NEED FURTHER BOLSTERING, WE </p><p>RECOMMEND ATTEMPTING TO FUND ADDITIONAL PROJECTS UNDER </p><p>THE MOU.  SEVERAL STAFF MEMBERS\' DESIRES TO LINK BTA </p><p>PASSAGE WITH GREATER PROGRAMS ON WORKERS\' RIGHTS WAS </p><p>NOT LOST ON THE VIETNAMESE.  VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS ARE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 10        HANOI  01026  031511Z </p><p>ALREADY ASKING SERIOUS QUESTIONS CONCERNING WHEN THE </p><p>U.S. WILL FORWARD THE BTA TO CONGRESS.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT LABOR BROUGHT BY THE </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATIONS MAY HAVE INCREASED GQ </p><p>ANXIETY ON THE BTA RATIFICATION PROCESS EVEN MORE. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p></div>
