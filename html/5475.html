He added that the U.S. </p><p>wanted to begin upgrading Turkish bases and ports before </p><p>February 10, and that a related draft would be submitted to </p><p>the parliament in two or three days.  If approved by the </p><p>parliament on February 6, the government will ask the TGS to </p><p>sign a related protocol with the U.S..  The U.S. will step </p><p>up pressure on the government for a swift parliamentary </p><p>approval, whereas the AKP will delay a decision to avoid </p><p>reaction from its grassroots, according to dailies. </p><p>Opposition CHP\'s leader Baykal said his party would approve </p><p>deployment of Turkish troops in Northern Iraq, but would </p><p>object to the stationing of U.S. troops in Turkey.  The </p><p>Turkish military\'s buildup on the Iraqi border continued </p><p>over the weekend.  Friday\'s National Security Council (NSC) </p><p>meeting advised the government to get parliamentary approval </p><p>for deployment of U.S. troops in Turkey, and for sending </p><p>Turkish troops to Northern Iraq.  Reports speculate that the </p><p>government will seek parliamentary approval for war only </p><p>after all peace attempts are exhausted and a new UN decision </p><p>is reached.  Sunday\'s dailies write that the U.S., unhappy </p><p>with the GOT\'s intention to wait for a resolution by the </p><p>UNSC, is urging the Turkish side to make a decision before </p><p>the Sacrifice Holiday that begins this weekend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: In an exclusive to "Sabah," U/S of State Marc </p><p>Grossman has urged the sides to exert effort for the </p><p>approval of the UN-sponsored Cyprus peace plan before the </p><p>February 28 deadline.  Grossman refrained from criticizing </p><p>Denktas.  If the Cyprus issue is resolved, Grossman said, </p><p>the EU\'s full membership negotiations with Turkey might even </p><p>start earlier than the scheduled date of December 2004. </p><p>Grossman made clear that the U.S. would oppose any agreement </p><p>that would carry the island back to the pre-1974 situation. </p><p>In response to a NSC warning that statements which might </p><p>weaken Denktas\' hand should be avoided, AKP leader Erdogan </p><p>said that Turkey\'s interests require a compromise in Cyprus, </p><p>and that the Annan plan was an opportunity that must be </p><p>seized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Edelman slated as new U.S. envoy to Turkey: Dailies cite a </p><p>NYT story which claimed that Vice President Cheney\'s </p><p>advisor, Eric Edelman, was the candidate to replace U.S. </p><p>Ambassador to Ankara, Robert Pearson.  A specialist on </p><p>Russia, Edelman could be assigned to Ankara this summer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan critical of autonomous boards: In response to press </p><p>reports criticizing the Banking Supervisory and Control </p><p>Board (BDDK) protocol with the bankrupt Pamukbank, which </p><p>relieves the owner Mehmet Emin Karamehmet of his $5.2 </p><p>billion debt, AKP leader Erdogan said that the government </p><p>had nothing to do with the operation.  `We prefer autonomous </p><p>boards to be subject to political authority.  Bankrupt banks </p><p>have already put a $50 billion burden on the economy, and </p><p>such moves add to that amount,\' Erdogan complained. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The plans for northern Iraq and Ankara\'s delay" </p><p>Washington correspondent of mass appeal Milliyet, Yasemin </p><p>Congar wrote (2/3): "Mark your calendar for the meeting in </p><p>Erbil on February 15.  The Iraqi opposition meeting will </p><p>determine the fate of the Iraqi regime once Saddam is gone. </p><p>. Despite the ongoing full-speed planning in Washington </p><p>about the future shape of Iraq, Turkey has still not </p><p>finalized its decision.  The AKP apparently has felt an </p><p>enormous burden over its responsibility on this issue, yet </p><p>this is only causing Ankara to become less influential on </p><p>the process. . The Bush administration is watching the </p><p>Turkish parliament very closely.  If the AKP administration </p><p>decides to call a parliamentary session after the religious </p><p>holiday, it might have a negative affect on Washington\'s </p><p>operational plans as well as Ankara\'s plans about northern </p><p>Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Matter of weeks, or maybe days" </p><p>Hasan Unal wrote in Islamic-intellectual Zaman (2/3): "The </p><p>statements of Bush and Blair provide a clear indication </p><p>about the timing of the coming war.  The US will evidently </p><p>not sit and watch after its immense military build-up.  The </p><p>current conditions indicate the start of a war within the </p><p>February-March period.  . The war might begin despite all of </p><p>Turkey\'s efforts for a diplomatic solution.  Once the war </p><p>starts, Turkey will be inevitably on the US\'s side, yet the </p><p>delayed action will prevent Turkey from making its case </p><p>about Iraq to its allies.  It will not only work against </p><p>Turkey\'s interests, but also bring a lot trouble in the near- </p><p>term.  In the event that Turkey persists in opposing a war, </p><p>the US will act unilaterally, and the reshaping of Iraq will </p><p>certainly be against Turkey\'s interests and security </p><p>concerns. . Both of these options are very dangerous for </p><p>Turkey. . The best option seems to be Turkey\'s full </p><p>involvement in this affair after very good bargaining with </p><p>the US based on Turkey\'s interests and benefits.  Yet time </p><p>is running out for us to achieve such a goal.  We do not </p><p>have the luxury to waste time or consume our energy with </p><p>ideological rationale.  At least the AKP government should </p><p>stay away from the anti-war debates based on ideological </p><p>justifications.  Otherwise we will face not only undesired </p><p>developments in Iraq but also lose America\'s friendship." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
