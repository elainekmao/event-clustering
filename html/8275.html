<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 002266 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, MAY 19-27: TERRORISM; </p><p>KUWAITI ELECTIONS; KUWAITI POWS; RECONCILIATION WITH IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: In contrast to the strongly pro-American tone </p><p>of commentary during Operation Iraqi Freedom, free style US </p><p>bashing has returned to some corners of Kuwait\'s Arabic </p><p>press.  Dr. Sadeq al Bassam writes in liberal Al-Qabas that </p><p>the US "bears responsibility" for the massacres Saddam </p><p>committed after the liberation of Kuwait and states that US </p><p>officials who were decision-makers twelve years ago should </p><p>be put on trial.  All papers report an allegation by a </p><p>Kuwaiti MP that "foreign embassies" are engaged in vote- </p><p>buying in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in July. </p><p> </p><p>One liberal commentator calls for Arab governments to adopt </p><p>"a perspective that recognizes that terrorism is a domestic </p><p>phenomenon," while another editor defends his paper\'s report </p><p>that the Kuwaiti Minister of Awqaf publicly referred to </p><p>Americans as "executioners" in a speech given several months </p><p>ago during a conference on "Dialogue Among Civilizations." </p><p>Kuwaiti POWs remain a front-page issue, with intensifying </p><p>public pressure for results. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: The Kuwaiti POW issue continues to </p><p>dominate the front pages this week. Al-Qabas reports that </p><p>families and relatives of Kuwaiti POWs are scheduled to </p><p>stage a sit-in in front of the National Assembly building on </p><p>May 26 to urge greater government efforts in accounting for </p><p>the POWs. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan front pages a report that two Iraqis told a Kuwaiti </p><p>team searching for POWs that they know of the location of a </p><p>mass grave in Kuwait. Al-Seyassah banners a report of a </p><p>"Kuwaiti POW found in Iraq" on May 26. </p><p> </p><p>Under the front-page headline, "MPs: Embassies and Sheikhs </p><p>Interfere in the Elections," Al-Seyassah reports on May 27 </p><p>accusations by certain MPs of vote-buying in the run-up to </p><p>the July Parliamentary elections. The newspaper quotes MP </p><p>Ahmad Al-Saadoun\'s warning to the Minister of Interior: </p><p>"This [vote-buying] is dangerous to the ruling system, </p><p>especially since money is available to many parties, </p><p>including foreign embassies." </p><p> </p><p>In response to the denial by Minister of Justice and Islamic </p><p>Affairs, Ahmad Baqer, of an Al-Watan report (see para. 4) </p><p>claiming Baqer referred to Americans as "executioners" in a </p><p>public speech, Al-Watan published on May 27 a transcript of </p><p>the speech with the offending remarks highlighted. </p><p> </p><p>The budget earmarked for the Kuwaiti team assigned to search </p><p>for Kuwaiti POWs in Iraq is KD 5 million (approx. USD 15 </p><p>million), Al-Qabas reports on May 25. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "Terrorism In The Gulf" </p><p>Liberal Kuwait University Political Science Professor, Dr. </p><p>Shamlan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (5/19): </p><p>"The recent terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia and Morocco </p><p>were not a surprise for many observers. Saudi Arabia and </p><p>many GCC nations adopted polices supportive of the </p><p>fundamentalist currents. They allowed the Arab Mujahedeen </p><p>from the Gulf to travel to Afghanistan, and then to Kosovo. </p><p>Then, these `Gulf Afghans\' returned home and began to </p><p>activate sleeping cells in order to fight against the US. </p><p>Combating terrorism requires a perspective that recognizes </p><p>that terrorism is a domestic phenomenon." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Baqer Should Not Be Blamed-- He Has Done Worse" </p><p>Liberal Editor-in-Chief of Al-Watan newspaper, Mohammad Al- </p><p>Jassim, opined (5/26):  "I cannot blame the Minister of </p><p>Justice and Islamic Affairs, Ahmad Baqer, for exploiting his </p><p>ministerial position to benefit his interests during the </p><p>upcoming elections. Baqer has done worse, yet no one held </p><p>him accountable. A few months ago, during a conference </p><p>entitled `Towards a Constructive Dialogue Among </p><p>Civilizations\', Minister Baqer gave a speech in which he </p><p>accused Americans of being `executioners\' [western values </p><p>being imposed on other cultures]. "Recently the </p><p>excecutioners have intensified ideology since fall of </p><p>communism and under influence of Zionism." I do not care </p><p>when any other Salafi accuses the Americans of being </p><p>`executioners,\' for this is their opinion. However, when </p><p>this is stated by a Minister in the Kuwaiti government, </p><p>claiming to represent the government\'s view, then this is </p><p>extremely dangerous. If the Minister views the Americans as </p><p>`executioners\', how can we blame any individual who adopts </p><p>Baqer\'s ideology when deciding to undertake a terrorist </p><p>operation?" </p><p> </p><p>5.  "The Arabs and Inhumane Feelings" </p><p>Lawyer Dr. Badria Al-Awadi wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(5/21):  "Regrettably, some Arab governments have exploited </p><p>the terrorist attacks in order to limit the freedom of their </p><p>citizens under the pretext of ensuring security for their </p><p>countries. They use the term `combat terrorism\' to end any </p><p>political opposition against them. The use of such a method </p><p>to combat terrorism by these inhumane governments only </p><p>encourages extremists to conduct terrorism in response, as </p><p>what happened in Saudi Arabia and Morocco." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "The Mass Graves in Iraq" </p><p>Dr. Sadeq Al-Bassam wrote in independent Al-Seyassah </p><p>(5/21):  "The US should bear the responsibility for these </p><p>massacres which occurred in 1991 after the liberation of </p><p>Kuwait. The US, and the entire world, must put the people </p><p>who carried out these massacres on trial to be punished. It </p><p>is also the responsibility of the US to offer compensation </p><p>and assistance to the families who lost their loved ones </p><p>over the past 12 years. Justice can be only achieved if the </p><p>US officials who were decision makers 12 years ago are also </p><p>put on trial, because they kept silent about the massacres </p><p>by Saddam." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "Partners in Crime" </p><p>Dr. Yasser Al-Saleh wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(5/27):  "A few days ago, some satellite [television] </p><p>channels broadcast the execution of three Iraqis who did not </p><p>support Saddam. This crime took place in 1983, which was the </p><p>golden age of Iraqi-American relations. It was also the year </p><p>Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld visited Iraq to offer military </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>cooperation to Saddam. The American administration cannot </p><p>deny that they knew exactly what was happening inside Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "What Every Iraqi Must Know" </p><p>Liberal Secretary General of the Kuwait Journalist\'s </p><p>Association, Faisal Al-Qanai wrote in independent Al- </p><p>Seyassah  (5/21):  "For the past 12 years, Saddam convinced </p><p>the Iraqi people that Kuwait was the country responsible for </p><p>Iraq\'s economic sanctions and Iraq\'s destruction and </p><p>poverty. One of the best ways to reveal the truth to the </p><p>Iraqis is to highlight the positive role in Kuwait\'s </p><p>assistance to the people of Iraq. The media is the most </p><p>appropriate weapon for clearing up any misunderstanding and </p><p>therefore, we must continue to demonstrate Kuwait\'s </p><p>[positive] position towards the Iraqi people." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "We Have to Take Care of Iraq\'s Children" </p><p>Liberal Faisal Al-Qanai wrote in independent Al-Seyassah </p><p>(5/24):  "If we really want to raise a common generation </p><p>between Iraq and Kuwait, then we have to focus on Iraq\'s </p><p>children. Saddam sowed the seeds of this problem in the </p><p>minds of those children. He made them hate Kuwait and the </p><p>Kuwaitis, and forced them to believe that Kuwait is the </p><p>cause for their suffering. The children of Iraq must feel </p><p>that Kuwait\'s children are their friends, and that Saddam </p><p>was the one responsible for their dilemma. Likewise, the </p><p>children of Kuwait must come to realize that the Iraqi </p><p>children are innocent of Saddam\'s crimes." </p><p> </p><p>10.  "Welcome, Mr. President" </p><p>Dr. Salah Al-Atteeqi wrote in independent Al-Qabas (5/24): </p><p>"A great leader who had a great role in the liberation of </p><p>Iraq and Afghanistan will be visiting Kuwait soon. We should </p><p>receive President Bush with all the respect and appreciation </p><p>he deserves, and we should remember that the US and the </p><p>allied countries were the only ones which stood with us </p><p>during the Iraqi occupation." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
