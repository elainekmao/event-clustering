(C) IN A MAY 18 CONVERSATION WITH UNPROFOR </p><p>OFFICIAL MIKAEL MAGNUSSON, MAGNUSSON SAID THAT WHILE </p><p>CROATIAN FORCES WERE HOLDING TO AGREEMENTS IN SECTOR </p><p>EAST, THE JNA APPEARED TO BE BENDING THE AGREED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00780  01 OF 03  191250Z </p><p>TIMETABLE.  CROATIAN ARMY AUTHORITIES WERE UPSET BY </p><p>REPORTS OF AN EXTENSION GRANTED TO THE JNA BY </p><p>UNPROFOR TO WITHDRAW JNA HEAVY ARTILLERY FROM SECTOR </p><p>EAST.  MEANWHILE, CROATIAN VICE PRESIDENT MILAN </p><p>RAMLJAK COMPLAINED BITTERLY TO UN GENERAL NAMBIAR </p><p>ABOUT THE ALLEGED EXPULSION OF 98 CIVILIANS FROM </p><p>SECTOR EAST BY SERB FORCES AFTER UNPROFOR TOOK OVER </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE REGION.

IN FRANK AND ADMITTEDLY UNOFFICIAL </p><p>COMMENTARY, MAGNUSSON TOLD US THAT OPERATIONS IN THAT </p><p>SECTOR WERE PROCEEDING "STICKINGLY".  WHILE CROATIAN </p><p>FORCES WERE ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TIMETABLE </p><p>FOR WITHDRAWAL OF THEIR FORCES FROM THE REGION, THE </p><p>JNA, EXPLAINED MAGNUSSON, WAS APPARENTLY TRYING TO </p><p>"BEND" THE TIMETABLE.  WHILE THE REASONS FOR JNA </p><p>RELUCTANCE TO WITHDRAW WERE NOT CLEAR, MAGNUSSON\'S </p><p>UNDERSTANDING (THOUGH HE COULD NOT CONFIRM THIS) WAS </p><p>THAT THE JNA HAD RECEIVED UNPROFOR PERMISSION TO </p><p>EXTEND THE DEADLINE BY WHICH HEAVY ARTILLERY WAS TO </p><p>BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE UNPA.

UNPROFOR PATROLS WERE COVERING ALL OF </p><p>SECTOR EAST, HE EXPLAINED, AND RANDOM PATROLS WERE </p><p>BEING RUN IN CRISIS AREAS OUTSIDE THE UNPA.  SO FAR, </p><p>SAID MAGNUSSON, UN PEACEKEEPERS WERE "TAKING NAMES, </p><p>BUT NOT KICKING ASS."  THEY HAD FILED COMPLAINTS WITH </p><p>THE JNA CONCERNING THE SLOWNESS OF ITS WITHDRAWAL. </p><p> </p><p>CROATIAN REACTION TO THE EXTENSION </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00780  02 OF 03  191251Z </p><p>4.  (U) IMMEDIATE CROATIAN REACTION TO THE </p><p>UNPROFOR-GRANTED EXTENSION CAME FROM THE DEPUTY </p><p>CROATIAN COMMANDER OF THE OSIJEK OPERATIONAL ZONE </p><p>BRANIMIR GLAVAS.  GLAVAS TOLD REPORTERS THAT CROATIAN </p><p>FORCES WERE OPPOSED TO AGREEMENTS IN WHICH THEY WERE </p><p>NOT CONSULTED (NOTE:  REPORTEDLY, THE CROATIAN ARMY </p><p>WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS </p><p>REGARDING THE EXTENSION).  GLAVAS ADDED THAT THE ARMY </p><p>WOULD DO WHAT ITS GOVERNMENT ASKED IT TO DO BUT THAT </p><p>IT WOULD NOT BE NAIVE.  HE CONTINUED BY SAYING THAT </p><p>"IF BY PEACEFUL MEANS, CROATIAN TERRITORY CANNOT BE </p><p>LIBERATED, THEN WE WILL THANK UNPROFOR AND SAY DEAR </p><p>SIRS, NOW IT IS FOR US TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE."  GLAVAS </p><p>CONCLUDED THAT THROUGH ACTIONS SUCH AS THE EXTENSION, </p><p>UNPROFOR WAS LOSING ITS POLITICAL CREDIBILITY. </p><p> </p><p>CROATIAN ANGER OVER MORE EXPULSIONS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.
