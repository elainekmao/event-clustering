Necip Hablemitoglu, </p><p>an associate professor at Ankara university known for his </p><p>investigations about Fethullah Gulen and foreign </p><p>foundations, reportedly had been receiving death threats for </p><p>some time, but had not requested protection.  "Sabah" </p><p>implies that the murder was reminiscent of political </p><p>killings in the recent past. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: "Milliyet" reports that Turkey is concerned about the </p><p>future of Mosul and Kirkuk, and is afraid that after the </p><p>deployment of US and British troops in Northern Iraq, </p><p>foreign troops could control the Mosul-Kirkuk region.  "Yeni </p><p>Safak" reports that there has been a great deal of </p><p>bargaining over Northern Iraq.  Turkey reportedly wants to </p><p>send its own troops into Northern Iraq, and is against the </p><p>deployment of British troops in the region.  However, the US </p><p>has rejected the Turkish proposal.  The sensationalist </p><p>"Star" newspaper also covers the issue on its front page. </p><p>"Star claims that `in order to stop the refugee influx, </p><p>Turkey wants to enter Northern Iraq.  But the US will </p><p>prevent this move because it has promised the Pehmerges to </p><p>invade Northern Iraq and establish a Kurdish State there. </p><p>"Hurriyet" reports that the Turkish General Staff has denied </p><p>press reports that the Turkish army is deploying extra </p><p>troops to the border, and that foreign troops had crossed </p><p>Turkish territory on their way to Northern Iraq.  The TGS </p><p>stressed that only routine preparations for a possible </p><p>operation were taking place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus:  All papers report that the Foreign Ministry has </p><p>released a harsh statement to the EU yesterday on the Cyprus </p><p>issue.  "Milliyet" reports that the Foreign Ministry has </p><p>accused the EU of violating international agreements and </p><p>making unilateral decisions about the future of the island. </p><p>All papers report that during the summit at the Presidential </p><p>Palace yesterday, TRNC president Denktas was urged by </p><p>Turkish officials to continue the negotiations and to seek a </p><p>settlement on Cyprus. </p><p>Turkey-Armenia:  "Cumhuriyet" reports a gesture from Turkey </p><p>to Armenia.  Turkey has been imposing sanctions to Armenia </p><p>by not allowing its airspace to be used for civilian </p><p>flights, and preventing Armenia from becoming a member of </p><p>Eurocontrol.  The veto on the Eurocontrol membership was </p><p>lifted, even though Azerbaijan had not yet joined the </p><p>organization. </p><p>Kurdish Broadcasting: The new regulation which allows </p><p>broadcasts in languages other than Turkish, including </p><p>broadcasts in Kurdish, was issued in the Official Gazette. </p><p>TRT will begin limited broadcasts in Kurdish on both </p><p>television and radio. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Iraq </p><p>b) Cyprus </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wrong move and Baghdad" </p><p>Fehmi Koru wrote in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak (12/19): </p><p>"There is a paradox on the Iraq issue.  The more reasons </p><p>there are to make an operation illegitimate, the more the </p><p>chances for a US operation increase.  Despite the lack of </p><p>convincing evidence about an Iraqi link with terrorism as </p><p>well as Iraq\'s possession of weapons of mass destruction, </p><p>Washington has not changed its policy.  The determination to </p><p>strike Iraq at all costs continues. . One has to be blind to </p><p>not see this fact: The US plan for Afghanistan in the post- </p><p>September 11 period will be implemented in Iraq as well. </p><p>Following the Iraq operation, the US will militarily expand </p><p>toward a vast geography, from the Philippines to Georgia </p><p>under the pretext of an Al-Qaeda link.  . In the absence of </p><p>a second UN resolution, the AKP government cannot support a </p><p>US military operation against Iraq.  Washington should not </p><p>take Ankara\'s support for granted.  Instead, efforts for a </p><p>peaceful solution should be pushed even harder." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Last tango in Cyprus" </p><p>Sami Kohen emphasized in mass appeal Milliyet (12/19): "It </p><p>appears impossible that the two leaders of Cyprus will not </p><p>come to the negotiating table.  There is simply no option </p><p>for them in the midst of an immense push from the EU and the </p><p>UN. . For the Greek Cypriot side, there is a deadline for a </p><p>settlement by February 28.  The EU does not want to see a </p><p>divided island, and the Greek Cypriot administration cannot </p><p>ignore a settlement just because it has been assured of EU </p><p>membership. . As for the Turkish Cypriots, there are some </p><p>factors which work in favor of a solution as well.  The </p><p>Turkish Cypriots are fed up with the `unsettled\' Cyprus </p><p>issue.  In the case of a continuation of no-settlement </p><p>situation, we might see some migration from the Turkish side </p><p>to the Greek side.  If that happens, the Turkish Republic of </p><p>Northern Cyprus will continue to be isolated and alienated </p><p>from the international community, not to mention the </p><p>challenges that Ankara will have to face vis--vis the EU, </p><p>the UN, and the US. . A long-lasting and good solution can </p><p>be found as long as the two leaders of Cyprus act with </p><p>common sense.  Both Denktas and Clerides are senior figures, </p><p>and the current process is probably their last chance for </p><p>peace." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
