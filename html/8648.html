CENTAF contacted Embassy\'s Assistant Air Attache in </p><p>connection with the objective of establishing agreements </p><p>allowing civilian air traffic control between Turkey and </p><p>Iraq.  With respect to air traffic between Turkey and </p><p>Iraq, CENTAF is proposing a Letter of Agreement between </p><p>the Area Control Centers of Ankara and Kirkuk (see para </p><p>5 for draft text) to govern air traffic control between </p><p>the two countries.  CENTAF provided Embassy with a draft </p><p>LOA for submission to Turkish civair authorities and </p><p>proposes a visit to Ankara to complete this process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Action Request:  Embassy is prepared to work with </p><p>GOT authorities and CENTAF on this issue, but has </p><p>received no front-channel instructions.  Embassy </p><p>requests Department provide instructions for </p><p>transmitting the draft LOA to Turkish civil and military </p><p>authorities, and other steps as necessary to help </p><p>conclude this agreement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Begin Text Letter Of Agreement Between the Area </p><p>Control Centre of ANKARA, TURKEY and KIRKUK, IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Subject:  Procedures relating to the coordination and </p><p>routing of IFR air traffic between the ACC </p><p>of Ankara and Kirkuk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   INTRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.1  Effective Date: DRAFT - TO BE COMPLETED BY TURKISH </p><p>AUTHORITIES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.2  Objective:  This Letter of Agreement (LOA) </p><p>documents agreement of provisions for enroute air </p><p>traffic control service between the CTA/FIR of Ankara </p><p>and Baghdad.  It delineates coordination procedures, </p><p>establishes routing of IFR aircraft, and identifies </p><p>transfer of control for aircraft movement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.3  Scope:  This agreement applies to the United States </p><p>Air Force Air Traffic Control Area Control Center at </p><p>Kirkuk ("FREEDOM CONTROL") and Ankara Area Control </p><p>Center "ANKARA CONTROL".   The procedures contained in </p><p>this operational letter of agreement that supplement or </p><p>detail, when so required, the procedures prescribed by </p><p>ICAO in the pertinent documents, shall be applied to all </p><p>IFR aircraft that cross the common boundary of the </p><p>CTA/FIRs of Ankara and Baghdad.   Each ACC facility is </p><p>responsible for the implementation of and compliance </p><p>with the procedures contained within this Letter of </p><p>Agreement (LOA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  CONTROL PROCEDURES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.1  Routing of Air Traffic:  ATS route VR21/V21 shall </p><p>be the only ingress/egress route for Iraq.  The air </p><p>traffic between the CTA/FIRs of Ankara and Baghdad shall </p><p>be established within the confines of this ATS route </p><p>prior to KABAN Intersection as outlined in the AIP, </p><p>Baghdad FIR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.2  Separation </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.2.1 Vertical:  Reduced Vertical Separation (RVSM) </p><p>shall not be permitted within the lateral confines of </p><p>Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.2.1.1   All transferring aircraft that enter the </p><p>respective ACC\'s CTA/FIR on ATS route VR21/R21 shall be </p><p>in level flight at an appropriate altitude for direction </p><p>of flight unless verbally coordinated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.2.2     Longitudinal:  During the transfer of control, </p><p>longitudinal separation shall be established between </p><p>aircraft at the same level, equal to or greater than </p><p>ICAO minimums.  Speed control will be applied between </p><p>aircraft that are at or near the minimum longitudinal </p><p>separation standards to prevent loss of separation. </p><p>This will ensure that separation is maintained until </p><p>another form of separation applied. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.2.2.1   The minimal longitudinal separation to be used </p><p>between aircraft flying at the same altitude on the same </p><p>ATS route shall be fifteen (15) minutes.  If navigation </p><p>aids permit frequent determination of position and </p><p>speed, separation may be reduced to ten (10) minutes or </p><p>twenty (20) miles if each aircraft utilizes the same "on </p><p>track" DME station and DME readings are checked at </p><p>frequent intervals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.2.3     Transfer of Control Point (TCP): </p><p>ATS  Route VR21/R21      KABAN (CTA/FIR Boundary) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.2.3.1   ACC\'s shall assume total control of aircraft </p><p>once it has been positively established that the </p><p>aircraft has passed KABAN Intersection and is inside the </p><p>CTA/FIR lateral limits unless verbally coordinated </p><p>otherwise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   CO-ORDINATION PROCEDURES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.1  General </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.1.1.    The coordination between the ACC of Ankara and </p><p>Kirkuk shall be effected in accordance with the </p><p>Standards, Recommended Practices, and procedures </p><p>prescribed by ICAO. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.1.2.    The Ankara/Kirkuk (identify land line to be </p><p>used - TO BE COMPLETED BY TURKISH AUTHORITIES) telephone </p><p>line circuit shall be used as the primary means of </p><p>coordination for all active IFR air traffic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.1.1.1   In the event the above procedures cannot be </p><p>carried out because of failure of the Ankara/Kirkuk </p><p>circuit, co-ordination of all IFR air traffic shall be </p><p>effected as follows: </p><p>a) (Develop Alternate Plan - TO BE COMPLETED BY TURKISH </p><p>AUTHORITIES) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.1.2     Positions serving as co-ordination points: </p><p>ATS Route             Point </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VR21/R21       KABAN (CTA/FIR Boundary) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.1.3     All coordination involving active IFR air </p><p>traffic shall be forwarded to the appropriate ACC at </p><p>least ten (10) minutes prior to the aircraft\'s estimate </p><p>for the position serving as the coordination point for </p><p>the ATS route involved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.1.3.1   The following coordination information shall </p><p>be passed: </p><p>a)   Aircraft Identification </p><p>b)   Type of Aircraft </p><p>c)   True Airspeed (TAS) </p><p>d)   Beacon Code </p><p>e)   Pilot\'s Estimated Time of Arrival Over KABAN </p><p>f)   Altitude </p><p>g)   Route of Flight (Departure airport and all routing </p><p>after coordination fix.) </p><p>h)   Any Other Pertinent Information </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.1.4     Emergencies:  The various circumstances </p><p>surrounding each emergency situation preclude the </p><p>establishment of exact detailed procedures.
