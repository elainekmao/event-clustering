<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001325 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PINS, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: KIDNAPPING OF NIGERIAN CHEVRON WORKER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 1535 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) Embassy\'s Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) </p><p>spoke July 31 with Ijaw national leader Chief Edwin K. Clark, </p><p>who confirmed press reports that two Ijaw men (Egbema clan) </p><p>involved in the kidnapping of the Nigerian Chevron employee </p><p>(reported reftel), who we understand was released on the </p><p>morning of August 1, have been arrested in Warri.  According </p><p>to Clark, the two Egbema youth appeared at a July 30 meeting </p><p>of the Delta State Security Council held by Delta State </p><p>Government James Ibori in Warri.  (Note: This forum is </p><p>normally restricted to government officials but the Governor </p><p>has included ethnic leaders since the outbreak of </p><p>inter-ethnic violence in Warri in March 2003.  end note) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) When Clark recognized the two as leaders of the group </p><p>claiming responsibility for the kidnapping, he identified </p><p>them to Ibori. Ibori promptly ordered their arrest, claims </p><p>Clark.  Ibori also reportedly issued an ultimatum to the </p><p>other kidnappers: release the Chevron officials within 48 </p><p>hours or risk police action.  Clark stressed the Egbema youth </p><p>involved in this extortion had neither his support nor that </p><p>of Egbema elders.  "They\'re just criminals," he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) CRO also spoke July 31 with Chevron\'s Abuja-based </p><p>General Manager for Governmental and Public Affairs, Sola </p><p>Omole, who explained  that PENGASSAN, the union of </p><p>white-collar Nigerian oil workers, had written to Chevron </p><p>urging the company to produce the release of its kidnapped </p><p>member within 72 hours.  He said the PENGASSAN letter cited </p><p>concerns for the employee\'s well-being, but the union never </p><p>threatened to strike over this matter. In Omole\'s words: "if </p><p>they\'ve threatened to strike, we don\'t know about it." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) Comment:  This was a criminal act, carried out by </p><p>youth acting outside the guidance of recognized Ijaw leaders, </p><p>even outside the Ijaw militant group "FNDIC."  This is not an </p><p>outgrowth of the ongoing Warri crisis, which centers on </p><p>fighting between the Itsekiri and the Ijaw Gbaramatu clan </p><p>over political representation and control of the oil-rich </p><p>Warri region.  Apparently, this also was not a case of the </p><p>union flexing its muscle to demand that Chevron win the </p><p>release of its member.  The story of a PENGASSAN threat was </p><p>likely the brainchild of an irresponsible journalist.  Given </p><p>PENGASSAN\'s lack of eagerness to join the recent national </p><p>labor strike against the fuel increase, it never seemed </p><p>likely that PENGASSAN would halt oil production now. Oil </p><p>production was never threatened by this kidnapping. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LIBERI </p><p></p></div>
