<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001542 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/PDA, IIP/G/WHA, AND WHA/CEN </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, PREL, MOPS, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTIONS ON DAN FISK\'S OP-ED, JUNE 30, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1. Op-ed by Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle (former Minister of Culture </p><p>in a Liberal Party administration) in San Pedro Sula-based </p><p>liberal daily "Tiempo" (owned by former and future Liberal Party </p><p>presidential candidate Jaime Rosenthal) on 6/30 entitled </p><p>"Honduras and the U.S.: Stick and Carrot II".  "I believe the </p><p>U.S. has the right to ask us to help them improve their security, </p><p>if they actually help us solve our most urgent problems." </p><p> </p><p>"Mr. Fisk inappropriately uses the words `us\' and `we\' as if he </p><p>was part of the collectivity he is referring to.  I find this </p><p>condescending." </p><p> </p><p>"U.S. policy doesn\'t have to be the best according to our </p><p>interests, it is just what it is.  We need to go further, rebuild </p><p>the Central American state, which will increase our chances to </p><p>effectively face criminal governments dominated by a militarist </p><p>and corrupt elite.  Only when we have a united Central American </p><p>state we can sit down with Mr. Under-secretary to tell him that </p><p>economic integration can go on." </p><p> </p><p>"I agree with Mr. Fisk that it is key to dispose of any surplus </p><p>personnel within our armies and all secret arsenals, even though </p><p>it is paradoxical that this comes from the government that </p><p>formed, trained and armed our armed forces. the most evident </p><p>threat for Central America is not any terrorist organization, it </p><p>is our hunger and structural hopelessness." </p><p> </p><p>" I\'m delighted that the U.S. wants to support the political </p><p>reforms we urgently need and I don\'t disagree with their </p><p>prescription: demilitarization, training, coordination and </p><p>reequipping police personnel to face the new challenges, among </p><p>them fighting against corruption." </p><p> </p><p>2. Op-ed by Edgardo Dumas Rodriguez (former Minister of Security </p><p>in a Liberal Party administration) in Tegucigalpa-based liberal </p><p>daily "La Tribuna" on 6/30 entitled "The military\'s raison </p><p>d\'etre". " Definitely, Mr. Fisk describes an innovative vision of </p><p>what our American friends think of how the Central American </p><p>militaries should be constituted." </p><p> </p><p>"Undoubtedly, we have made efforts whose results are obvious. </p><p>It\'s up to us to decide if we are pleased and satisfied with </p><p>them, or, if on the other hand. it\'s urgent to take the </p><p>appropriate steps to overcome this crisis, to ensure auspicious </p><p>and peaceful expectations by having security forces such as those </p><p>proposed by Mr. Fisk." </p><p> </p><p>"Finally, it\'s worthwhile reminding ourselves that the U.S. has </p><p>always helped us to shape our armed forces.  Will they be willing </p><p>to help us prepare the armed forces we need now?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
