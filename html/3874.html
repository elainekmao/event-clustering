CLASSIFIED BY A/DCM SCOTT BELLARD, REASON 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) VIETNAM SUPPORTS THE ASEAN "10 MINUS X" FORMULA, SO </p><p>LONG AS IT IS CONFINED TO THE ECONOMIC REALM AND DOES NOT </p><p>INTERFERE WITH POLICY OR POLITICAL AFFAIRS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>MFA ASEAN DEPARTMENT DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL PHAM HUU CHI, </p><p>VIETNAM ACCEPTS THE WISH OF OTHER ASEAN MEMBERS TO MOVE </p><p>FORWARD WITH THE 10 MINUS X POLICY AS A MEANS OF ADVANCING </p><p>"SEPARATE BUT COMPATIBLE AGENDAS."  HANOI\'S MAIN CONCERN IS </p><p>THAT THIS FORMULA NOT ENCROACH INTO AREAS DEALING WITH </p><p>POLITICAL FORMULATIONS, CHI NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  UNDER THE CURRENT DESIGN, CHI SAID THAT ALL MEMBER </p><p>STATES WOULD BE FREE TO JOIN OR AVOID SIGNING ANY ASEAN </p><p>INITIATIVE AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION.  HANOI BELIEVES THIS </p><p>FORMULA COULD WORK WITH AN X VARIABLE OF 2 TO 3 COUNTRIES, </p><p>BUT "ANY MORE WOULD BE TOO MUCH, AND WOULD JUST NOT WORK." </p><p>IF 5 TO 6 MEMBERS DECIDED AGAINST AGREEING TO A PLAN, THEN </p><p>"THAT INITIATIVE WOULD SIMPLY BE UNTENABLE UNDER ASEAN </p><p>STANDARDS," HE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) WHEN ASKED HOW THIS MIGHT AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>GAP, CHI STATED THAT HE DID NOT THINK IT WOULD HAVE MUCH OF </p><p>AN EFFECT AS LONG AS THE MORE AFFLUENT AND DEVELOPED </p><p>MEMBERS CONTINUED TO PROVIDE THE DEVELOPING STATES WITH </p><p>EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND INFRASTRUCTUAL ASSISTANCE. </p><p>CHI ADDED THAT VIETNAM WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MINUS X </p><p>FORMULA GROW TO INCLUDE AREAS OF SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02385  030850Z </p><p>COOPERATION AS WELL AS ECONOMICS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CHI ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS A NEW PROPOSAL AND WOULD </p><p>TAKE TIME TO REFINE.  HE SAID THAT "SOME MEMBERS WERE MORE </p><p>EAGER THAN OTHERS" IN MOVING THIS INITIATIVE FORWARD AND </p><p>THAT FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THIS TOPIC IS STILL NEEDED. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
