<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001273 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA/ARP, DS/ICI/PII, DS/IP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, PREL, CASC, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: FOLLOW-UP ON JANUARY 21 TERROR ATTACK IN KUWAIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 00222 </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 00225 </p><p> </p><p>(U) LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE; PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The following is an update on judicial actions taken </p><p>against those involved in the January 21 terrorist attack on </p><p>U.S. citizens near Camp Doha.  The GOK moved quickly to </p><p>apprehend the gunman and other suspects, however two </p><p>accessories remain at large and the Kuwaitis have had little </p><p>success in locating them.  The wheels of justice in Kuwait </p><p>sometimes spin slowly; the trial has already been postponed </p><p>from March 12 to April 2, and again from April 2 to April 7. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>PRIME SUSPECT: SAMI AL-MUTAIRI </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Sami Al-Mutairi faces charges of felony murder and </p><p>attempted murder (as well as a variety of weapons charges) as </p><p>a result of the January 21, 2003 shooting of two American DoD </p><p>contractors, Michael Rene Pouliot and David Caraway.  Pouliot </p><p>and Caraway were shot in their vehicle as they sat at a red </p><p>light near Camp Doha; Pouliot was killed instantly while </p><p>Caraway sustained multiple gunshot wounds.  Pouliot and </p><p>Caraway were employees of Tapestry Solutions, a San Diego </p><p>based defense contractor involved in the development of </p><p>software applications used in military training. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Al-Mutairi attempted to flee to Saudi Arabia, but </p><p>was apprehended at a Saudi border checkpoint on January 22. </p><p>He confessed twice while in Saudi custody and was turned over </p><p>to Kuwait State Security (KSS) later that morning, at which </p><p>time he offered a third confession.  Al-Mutairi was a social </p><p>worker employed by the GOK at the time of the shooting.  A </p><p>known Islamic extremist, his passport was seized in late 2001 </p><p>by KSS after he made an unsuccessful attempt to travel to </p><p>Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban.  Arrested in Iran, </p><p>Al-Mutairi (and other young Kuwaitis) spent two months in </p><p>jail there before being deported back to Kuwait.  At his </p><p>first hearing on February 2, Al-Mutairi recanted, claiming </p><p>his confessions were coerced.  He was held pending further </p><p>investigation, and remains in custody today.  Al-Mutairi\'s </p><p>trial was first scheduled to begin March 12, but was </p><p>postponed at that time until April 2.  The trial opened </p><p>briefly on April 2 before being postponed again until April 7. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Sami al-Mutairi is being charged with felony murder </p><p>and attempted murder.  It is likely his trial could last for </p><p>one year; the trial begins when the public prosecutor files </p><p>the indictment with the competent criminal court and ends </p><p>when a judgement is rendered by the Court of First Instance. </p><p>Once a criminal judgement is rendered, either the prosecutor </p><p>or the defendant can appeal the decision to the Court of </p><p>Appeals.  At both the Court of First Instance and the Court </p><p>of Appeals, a panel of three judges will hear the case; there </p><p>is no trial by jury in Kuwait.  If the Court of First </p><p>Instance returns a guilty verdict and imposes the death </p><p>penalty, the case will automatically be heard again by the </p><p>Court of Appeals.  The appellate process is likely to last </p><p>one year before a final and enforceable judgement is </p><p>rendered.  If the death penalty is ordered, the judgement </p><p>cannot be carried out without the endorsement of the Amir, </p><p>who has the discretion to pardon the defendant or to commute </p><p>the sentence. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>ACCOMPLICES </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Abdullah Amr Al-Utaybi trained Al-Mutairi in the </p><p>operation of the AK-47 used in the attack.  According to </p><p>Al-Mutairi\'s confession, after the attack, he invited himself </p><p>to Al-Utaybi\'s farm where he revealed his involvement in the </p><p>shooting.  Al-Utaybi praised Al-Mutairi for the attack and </p><p>agreed to help him escape into Saudi Arabia.  Employed by </p><p>Arab Oil Company, Al-Utaybi crossed the border on his company </p><p>ID after dropping Al-Mutairi off at the Kuwaiti border </p><p>checkpoint.  He planned to meet Al-Mutairi at a gas station </p><p>on the Saudi side of the border, but Al-Mutairi was detained </p><p>by Saudi police before reaching the rendezvous point.  KSS </p><p>believes Al-Utaybi is hiding in Saudi Arabia, and is working </p><p>with the Saudis to find and extradite him for questioning </p><p>regarding his involvement in the shooting. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Badi Kruz Al-Ajami was arrested by KSS for </p><p>transferring the AK-47 which Al-Mutairi used in the attack. </p><p>Kruz is a known Islamic extremist with a criminal history; he </p><p>was arrested in 2000 for attacking a Kuwaiti female whose </p><p>face was uncovered, and served time for involvement with the </p><p>Muhammed Al-Dusari terrorist case from November 2000.  He </p><p>remains in custody at this time pending further investigation. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Rajih Hassan Al-Ajami is charged with transporting </p><p>the AK-47 from Kruz to Al-Mutairi.  His current location is </p><p>unknown,but he is believed to have possibly fled Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Khalifa Al-Dihani was arrested for selling 700 </p><p>rounds of ammunition to Al-Mutairi.  He remains in custody </p><p>pending further investigation. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>COMPENSATION </p><p>------------ </p><p>9. (U) In Kuwait, the victim of a crime (or his heirs) are </p><p>entitled to claim civil compensation before the criminal </p><p>court which is handling the case.  The civil claimant is </p><p>entitled to representation during the trial and may appeal </p><p>the civil judgement.  The criminal court has the discretion </p><p>to postpone the civil component of the trial until after </p><p>sentencing if it determines the simultaneous consideration of </p><p>both criminal and civil components will delay disposition of </p><p>the criminal element.  If the Amir chooses to pardon the </p><p>defendant or to commute his sentence, that will have no </p><p>bearing on the civil element of the case and will not prevent </p><p>payment of compensation to the victim (or his heirs). </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Both Tapestry Solutions and David Caraway have </p><p>contacted post to indicate their desire to seek compensation, </p><p>and both have retained local counsel to pursue their claims. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Since the shooting on January 21, post has been </p><p>actively involved in this case.  An FBI team arrived in </p><p>Kuwait on January 24, and remains in country participating in </p><p>the investigation.  The team is in regular contact with KSS </p><p>and the public prosecutors, underlining U.S. determination to </p><p>see those responsible for this attack punished.  ConOff </p><p>maintains close contact with David Caraway, Tapestry </p><p>Solutions, and Michael Pouliot\'s widow Carol, and furnishes </p><p>regular updates on the progress of the investigation. </p><p>Although the Kuwaitis are eager to see Sami Al-Mutairi held </p><p>accountable for the shooting, progress in arresting </p><p>accessories has been limited and the final disposition of the </p><p>case cannot be predicted.  Post will continue to closely </p><p>monitor this case and keep up the pressure on Kuwait and </p><p>bring all those involved in this attack to justice. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
