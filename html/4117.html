<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 006333 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MURDER OF USAID\'S LAURENCE </p><p>FOLEY IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>                 Print Media Coverage </p><p> </p><p>-- The assassination of Laurence Foley dominated the </p><p>Jordanian dailies on Tuesday October 29.  The stories </p><p>included a strong condemnation of the act by the </p><p>Minister of Information, and by Jordanian political </p><p>parties, most notable among them the Islamic Action </p><p>Front, and professional associations. </p><p> </p><p>Semi-official influential Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i devoted </p><p>its entire front page to various reports on the story </p><p>that highlighted the "soundness" of Jordan\'s security, </p><p>and the satisfaction of the U.S. with Jordanian </p><p>authorities\' reaction to the assassination.  Headlines </p><p>included: "U.S. Ambassador lauds the efficacy of </p><p>Jordan\'s security measures;" "Gnehm affirms his </p><p>confidence in Jordan\'s ability top protect diplomatic </p><p>missions;" "U.S. Administration lauds the Jordanian </p><p>authorities\' cooperation;" "American citizens in </p><p>Amman: This was an isolated incident."  In addition, </p><p>the political editor wrote a piece in which he argued </p><p>that: "Whoever killed Foley wanted to attack the </p><p>Jordanian model of moderation and faithfulness to </p><p>national strength.  The objectives of the crime go </p><p>beyond the innocent American and touch every Jordanian </p><p>in his security and livelihood." </p><p> </p><p>The centrist, influential among the elite English </p><p>daily Jordan Times concentrated more on Foley\'s life, </p><p>quoting as headline Ambassador Gnehm\'s description of </p><p>the Foley as "A man dedicated to helping others." </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>reported the strong condemnations of the attack, which </p><p>were the subject of its lead headline, but its </p><p>coverage concentrated more on the details of the </p><p>crime.  Elements of the report included interviews </p><p>with the neighbors, who said that this might have been </p><p>the work of a professional, and that Foley\'s two dogs </p><p>did not bark at the assailant. It also reported </p><p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair\'s comment that the </p><p>attacks in Moscow, Bali, and Amman are faces of the </p><p>same terror. </p><p> </p><p>Independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al- </p><p>Yawm\'s coverage resembled that of Al-Dustour, but </p><p>included a prominent piece by Islamic writer Samih Al- </p><p>Ma\'aytah who wrote: "It would be unacceptable to </p><p>hesitate in condemning such violence." </p><p> </p><p>              Jordan Television Coverage </p><p> </p><p>-- Jordan TV\'s main Arabic newscast at 8:00 p.m. on </p><p>Monday, October 28 carried the assassination of Larry </p><p>Foley in Amman as its first news report.  The 18- </p><p>minute report included 4 minutes of condemnations </p><p>expressed by the Minister of Information and </p><p>representatives of various political parties and a </p><p>local newspaper columnist Mr. Samih Ma\'aytah from Al- </p><p>Arab Al-Yawm.  The report then carried one and a half </p><p>minutes featuring excerpts from Ambassador Gnehm\'s </p><p>news conference held at the U.S. Embassy, with Arabic </p><p>voice-over, focusing on the late Larry Foley\'s work </p><p>within USAID and on the condolences the Embassy had </p><p>received from the King and other Jordanian officials. </p><p>A seven-minute feature then followed highlighting </p><p>USAID programs in Jordan in the three main sectors, </p><p>water, economy and health.  The feature included </p><p>statements by the Minister of Water and Irrigation, </p><p>the Minister of Health, and an official from the Aqaba </p><p>Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) praising </p><p>USAID\'s important developmental role in Jordan.  In </p><p>studio and following the report, Minister of Planning </p><p>Dr. Bassem Awadallah was interviewed live, where he </p><p>offered his condolences and highly praised USAID\'s </p><p>important role in the various development sectors in </p><p>Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>--Jordan TV\'s English "News at Ten" on Monday, October </p><p>28, carried a report similar to the one carried in the </p><p>main Arabic newscast.  The 10 minute report included 3 </p><p>minutes of condemnations expressed by the Minister of </p><p>Information and representatives of the Professional </p><p>Associations Union, the Islamic Action Front and the </p><p>Jordanian Communist Party; one and a half minutes from </p><p>Ambassador Gnehm\'s news conference; followed by a </p><p>three and a half minute feature in English </p><p>highlighting USAID programs in Jordan.  Like the </p><p>Arabic, the feature included footage of various USAID- </p><p>funded projects in Jordan and statements by the </p><p>Ministers and an ASEZA official </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "An attack on Jordan\'s image and reputation" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i </p><p>(10/29):  "The assassination of the American diplomat </p><p>yesterday morning in front of his house in the heart </p><p>of Amman was not directed against America but against </p><p>the image and reputation of Jordan as a country of </p><p>security where foreigners need no guards to be safe. </p><p>Every day, we criticize the U.S. policies in the </p><p>region, particularly in as far as they are related to </p><p>the blind bias in favor of Sharon\'s measures against </p><p>the innocent Palestinian people, who have been </p><p>struggling under the duress of the Israeli occupation </p><p>for the past 35 years, as well as to siege imposed </p><p>against the Iraqi people and threat to launch war </p><p>against Iraq.  But, criticizing America\'s policies in </p><p>one thing and assaulting the life of an American </p><p>citizen is another.  The first is acceptable, but the </p><p>second is terrorism to be rejected." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Terrorism will not scare and those who tamper with </p><p>Jordan\'s security will pay" </p><p> </p><p>Semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Ra\'i </p><p>(10/29) editorializes:  "The ugly crime against the </p><p>American diplomat yesterday revealed the black hatred </p><p>and rage that the perpetrators of this crime have for </p><p>Jordan, its security, its people and its active role </p><p>in the region and in the international world.  These </p><p>games and terrorist strikes will not affect us, will </p><p>not terrorize us and will not make us change our path </p><p>of supporting our nation\'s just causes, peace and </p><p>dialogue." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Amman too" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(10/29):  "Terrorist military activity has never had </p><p>any successes in Jordan, but this is maybe due to the </p><p>fact that Jordan was never seriously targeted.  Under </p><p>the current circumstances, it seems that Jordan has </p><p>moved to that list of countries where the American and </p><p>western presence would be targeted.  Assassinations </p><p>seems to be the easiest to execute, and although we </p><p>cannot conclude that the assassination is connected </p><p>with Al-Qa\'eda, the possibility cannot be ignored, and </p><p>this in itself requires more vigilance." </p><p> </p><p>-- "An enemy of himself" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Basem Sakijha writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(10/29):  "Those who shot the American diplomat </p><p>yesterday did not help themselves and did not help our </p><p>cause.  It is an act that perpetuates the image that </p><p>everyone has of us [as Arabs and Muslims]; and an act </p><p>that supports the American right-wing and the Zionist </p><p>lobby in their campaign to defile our image and </p><p>reputation." </p><p>-- "A despicable crime and Jordan is the target" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(10/29):  "Jordan\'s national security and stability </p><p>are the targets of such crimes.  Under no </p><p>circumstances should there be justification or </p><p>reasoning for not condemning such crimes, and we </p><p>should not settle for one explanation or another to </p><p>justify these crimes.  If we settle for this, then we </p><p>would be justifying the fact that some people </p><p>committed a murder like yesterday\'s, against an </p><p>official who works for a developmental agency that has </p><p>provided Jordan with millions of dollars over the </p><p>years to upgrade less fortunate areas of the Kingdom." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Act of treachery" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (10/29) editorializes:  "The </p><p>assassination of a U.S. diplomat credited to Jordan </p><p>yesterday morning is a despicable and cowardly act. </p><p>Whoever is behind the killing aimed not only to take </p><p>the life of an innocent person, one whose work here </p><p>involved providing financial and economic assistance </p><p>to the country, but also to discredit and destabilize </p><p>the Kingdom.  The Kingdom has not and will not allow </p><p>itself to be a sanctuary for those seeking to commit </p><p>acts of violence against anyone, especially diplomats </p><p>serving in Amman.  The people of the country must </p><p>stand shoulder to shoulder with the government and all </p><p>its agencies and security apparatuses in the search </p><p>for the killer or killers and bring them to justice as </p><p>a matter of highest priority." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
