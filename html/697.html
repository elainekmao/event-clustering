C - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  PROMINENT CAMBODIAN-AMERICAN LEADER SICHAN SIV </p><p>(PROTECT) HAD A ONE-ON-ONE SESSION DECEMBER 6 WITH </p><p>SECOND PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN.  THE PRIME MINISTER WAS </p><p>RELAXED AND DEMONSTRATED A GOOD GRASP OF DETAIL, </p><p>ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE.  HIS PRINCIPAL POINTS WERE AS </p><p>FOLLOWS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  RELEASE OF COUP PLOTTER SIN SEN.  THE TWO PRIME </p><p>MINISTERS WERE SIMPLY UNABLE TO SAY NO TO THE KING\'S </p><p>REQUEST.  IN ANY CASE, ONLY THE KING HAS THE POWER TO </p><p>PARDON OR REDUCE SENTENCES.  ONE HOPES THAT SIN SEN WILL </p><p>NOT BE RELEASED UNTIL THE APPEAL THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN </p><p>FILED IS HEARD. </p><p> </p><p>4.  DEMOCRACY.  RESPONDING TO CONCERN THAT MOVES MAY BE </p><p>AFOOT TO LIMIT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OR OTHER BASIC </p><p>FREEDOMS, THERE WAS AGREEMENT THAT DEMOCRACY MUST BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO FLOURISH AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION MAINTAINED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  STATE OF THE CPP.  RUMORS OF A SPLIT BEGAN IN </p><p>1985-86.  THEY WERE NOT TRUE THEN, NOR ARE THEY TRUE </p><p>NOW.  IT WAS HE, HUN SEN, WHO HELPED DEVELOP OVER THE </p><p>YEARS AND BRING TO THE FOREFRONT TWO PARTY LEADERS, SAR </p><p>KHENG AND SAY CHHUM, THIS REGARDLESS OF THEIR MARRIAGES </p><p>TO CHEA SIM\'S SISTERS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MILITARY SITUATION.  IN GENERAL, IT REMAINS GOOD. </p><p>PHNOM KULEN (ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF PREAH VIHEAR </p><p>PROVINCE) WAS CAPTURED, SIEM REAP PROVINCE IS UNDER </p><p>CONTROL, BATTAMBANG IS NOT SEEING TOO MUCH ACTIVITY, </p><p>KOMPONG THOM IS QUIET, AND KAMPOT IS IN HAND.  THE </p><p>NUMBER OF KR DEFECTORS HAS BECOME QUITE LARGE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  RICE.  THE SHORTFALL IS SERIOUS, ESPECIALLY IN THE </p><p>EASTERN PROVINCES.  HE IS TRYING TO PERSUADE FARMERS TO </p><p>PLANT DRY SEASON RICE TO MAKE UP THE DEFICIT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT.  SIV ADMITTED THAT HE COULD NOT TELL HOW </p><p>GENUINELY SUPPORTIVE HUN SEN WAS OF BASIC FREEDOMS OR </p><p>HOW MUCH HE WAS IN AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE HIS GUEST </p><p>FEEL GOOD.  SIV REMINDED HUN SEN THAT CAMBODIANS ABROAD </p><p>NEED FAR MORE NEWS THAN THE GLOOM AND DOOM CARRIED IN </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS AND REQUESTED THAT THE RCG MAKE </p><p>AN EFFORT TO GET THE NEWS OUT TO THEM.  HUN SEN PROMISED </p><p>TO MAKE SURE THAT SIV AND OTHERS ARE INFORMED OF </p><p>IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>TWINING </p><p></p></div>
