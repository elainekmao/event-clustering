<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L USUN NEW YORK 03978 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, XK, UNSC, OAS, PM, </p><p>SUBJECT: TFPM02: MEETING WITH SC PRESIDENT ON PANAMA </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 403831 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  AMB PICKERING MET WITH SC PRESIDENT </p><p>(COLOMBIA) DEC 20 TO ASK THAT A LETTER SETTING FORTH THE </p><p>REASONS FOR U.S. ACTIONS IN PANAMA AND A COPY OF </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S STATEMENT BE CIRCULATED AS OFFICIAL UN </p><p>DOCUMENTS.  PICKERING ALSO ARGUED AGAINST PREMATURE </p><p>ACTION BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL, SUGGESTING THAT THE SC </p><p>WAIT TO SEE WHAT ACTION THE OAS WOULD TAKE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AMBS PICKERING AND WATSON, TOGETHER WITH POL AND </p><p>LEGAL COUNSELORS, MET WITH SC PRESIDENT ENRIQUE PENALOSA </p><p>(COLOMBIA) MORNING DEC 20.  PICKERING DELIVERED TO </p><p>PENALOSA COPIES OF PRESIDENT BUSH\'S STATEMENT MADE </p><p>7:20AM DEC 20 AND A LETTER SETTING FORTH THE REASONS FOR </p><p>U.S. ACTION IN PANAMA.  HE ASKED THAT BOTH BE CIRCULATED </p><p>AS OFFICIAL SC DOCUMENTS.  PENALOSA AGREED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  PENALOSA SAID HE NEEDED U.S. ADVICE REGARDING THE </p><p>NICARAGUAN REQUEST FOR AN IMMEDIATE MEETING OF THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL.  HIS OWN INCLINATION WOULD BE TO HOLD </p><p>INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS OF THE WHOLE COUNCIL AT 11:00AM, </p><p>THEN FOLLOW WITH AN OPEN MEETING WHERE THE U.S., THE </p><p>NICARAGUANS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES DELEGATIONS </p><p>COULD MAKE STATEMENTS.  HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE THE </p><p>COUNCIL TAKING ANY IMMEDIATE ACTION, BUT OVER THE NEXT </p><p>FEW DAYS THAT HE WOULD REMAIN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE </p><p>MEMBERS, SEE HOW THE SITUATION DEVELOPS, AND DETERMINE </p><p>IF A FURTHER MEETING AND ANY OTHER ACTION IS NECESSARY. </p><p>PENALOSA ALSO SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE THE LATIN MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE COUNCIL COULD PREPARE A PROPOSAL.  PICKERING </p><p>INDICATED IT WAS PREMATURE TO CONSIDER SUCH AN APPROACH. </p><p> </p><p>5.  PICKERING STRESSED THAT IT IS IMPRACTICAL TO HAVE </p><p>CONSULTATIONS OF THE WHOLE COUNCIL SO EARLY.  A NUMBER </p><p>OF QUESTIONS NEEDED TO BE CONSIDERED.  HE SAID THE </p><p>DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA HAD </p><p>APPOINTED A NEW PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE AND THAT HIS </p><p>CREDENTIALS WOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE SYG VERY SHORTLY. </p><p>THE U.S. FEELS STRONGLY THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE </p><p>NORIEGA REGIME SHOULD NOT SPEAK IN THE COUNCIL AND THAT </p><p>THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA SHOULD BE SEATED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  PICKERING ALSO SAID THAT THE OAS WAS CONSIDERING THE </p><p>ISSUE.  HE ARGUED THAT SINCE THE OAS IS THE REGIONAL </p><p>FORUM FROM WHICH, UNDER ARTICLE 52 OF THE CHARTER, THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD TAKE ITS LEAD.  HE SUGGESTED </p><p>THAT PENALOSA MAY WANT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE </p><p>COLOMBIAN AMBASSADOR AT THE OAS IN ORDER TO LEARN FOR </p><p>HIMSELF WHAT STEPS THE OAS WAS PLANNING TO TAKE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  PICKERING CONCLUDED BY SUGGESTING THAT PENALOSA </p><p>CONSULT WITH INTERESTED MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL </p><p>BILATERALLY AND SCHEDULE ANOTHER MEETING WITH THE U.S. </p><p>LATER IN THE DAY TO DISCUSS THE POSITIONS OF THE MEMBERS </p><p>OF THE COUNCIL.  PICKERING EMPHASIZED THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>PREMATURE TO RUSH AHEAD WITH CONSULTATIONS OF THE WHOLE </p><p>THIS MORNING. </p><p> </p><p>8.  PICKERING NOTED THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAD SPOKEN BY </p><p>TELEPHONE WITH PRESIDENT BARCO (WHO SAID HE WOULD TRY TO </p><p>BE HELPFUL), PRIME MINISTERS MULRONEY AND THATCHER AND </p><p>OTHER LEADERS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT PRELIMINARY REPORTS </p><p>INDICATE THAT A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE READY TO </p><p>RECOGNIZE THE NEW GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT.  IN AN EFFORT TO DELAY SC CONSIDERATION OF </p><p>THE ISSUE AND ALLOW THE PERMREP OF THE DEMOCRATIC </p><p>PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TO PRESENT HIS CREDENTIALS, USUN </p><p>IS ATTEMPTING TO PROLONG THE PERIOD OF BILATERAL </p><p>CONSULTATIONS.  AT OUR REQUEST, THE UK, FRENCH, AND </p><p>CANADIAN DELEGATIONS HAVE ALSO REQUESTED BILATERAL </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH THE SC PRESIDENT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PICKERING </p><p></p></div>
