<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008079 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, TU, POLITICAL PARTIES </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: CHP ELECTION POSTMORTEM </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 7766 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass.  Reason: 1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The Nov. 3 Parliamentary elections were a </p><p>major defeat for CHP at the hands of AK.  Although CHP joins </p><p>AK as one of only two parties in Parliament, CHP officials </p><p>and activists are deeply disappointed by their distant </p><p>second-place finish.  Much of the blame has been placed on </p><p>CHP leader Baykal, who failed to overcome a reputation for </p><p>"factionalist" divisiveness, and star CHP candidate Kemal </p><p>Dervis.  The CHP suffered from its image as a party of an </p><p>elite Establishment out of touch with the average, more </p><p>conservative Turkish voter.  A chastened CHP in Parliament </p><p>will have a chance to demonstrate its willingness to </p><p>refashion the party along more social democratic and less </p><p>overtly Kemalist lines.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Failure Disguised as Success </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Deniz Baykal\'s effort to emphasize the successful </p><p>return of his Republican Peoples\' Party (CHP) to Parliament </p><p>on Nov. 3 belies what is widely acknowledged to be CHP\'s </p><p>trouncing at the hands of the Islam-influenced Justice and </p><p>Development (AK) Party (reftel).  After three years in the </p><p>political wilderness, CHP returned to the legislature with </p><p>19.3% of the vote, 178 seats, and as the sole opposition </p><p>party.  Nevertheless, the election results were met with </p><p>shock, disbelief, and disappointment at CHP headquarters, </p><p>where many had expected the party to capture the 25%-30% of </p><p>the vote traditionally apportioned to left-of center parties </p><p>in Turkey.  CHP blew some significant advantages.  Turkish </p><p>observers point out that although the party had long been </p><p>preparing for elections, was not tainted with the previous </p><p>Parliament\'s perceived failings, had no center-left </p><p>challengers to its position as champion of the Establishment </p><p>and "alternative" to AK, it fell short of the 20% mark. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Much of the blame has been directed at Baykal and </p><p>former state minister Kemal Dervis, CHP\'s star candidate. </p><p>Offering a representative views, Former Deputy Speaker of </p><p>Parliament and Democratic Left Party (DSP) Izmir deputy </p><p>Atilla Mutman acknowledged to poloff that while voters had </p><p>lost faith in P.M. Ecevit\'s DSP, they stayed home on election </p><p>day rather than vote for a Baykal widely regarded as </p><p>quarrelsome and "factionalist."  Former Independent (earlier </p><p>DSP) Ankara deputy Uluc Gurkan also pointed to Baykal\'s </p><p>unpopularity, as well as to CHP\'s generally weak candidate </p><p>list.  Gurkan marveled that CHP\'s vote barely surpassed AK by </p><p>even 1.4% in Ankara\'s First District, a normally center-left </p><p>stronghold.  On Nov 8. a former staffer at the Turkish NSC, </p><p>now with a Istanbul-based think tank, echoed to us comments </p><p>from numerous observers that Dervis\' candidacy had played </p><p>poorly in the rural Anatolian heartland, and was in his view </p><p>the key reason for CHP\'s defeat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Comment: The New Face of Fundamentalism? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Though CHP finished first in only 12 of Turkey\'s 81 </p><p>provinces, the leadership appears baffled by Turkish voters\' </p><p>decision to opt for AK over the party of Ataturk.  Where in </p><p>other countries the left prides itself on its role as </p><p>champions of the oppressed or the have-nots, the </p><p>"respectable" left in Turkey has largely become the </p><p>standard-bearer of the elite widely regarded as out of touch </p><p>with, and in some cases even hostile to, ordinary Turks. </p><p>(When invited to an Ramazan iftar (fast-breaking) dinner in </p><p>honor of departing poloff, newly elected CHP Ankara deputy </p><p>Yilmaz Ates declined, noting that he does not fast and so in </p><p>principle does not attend "these kinds of events.") </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Despite its failings, CHP is in Parliament, and thus </p><p>has a chance to demonstrate its willingness to refashion </p><p>itself along more social democratic and less Kemalist lines. </p><p>For now, Baykal is promising to work constructively with the </p><p>next (AK) government.  After meeting with President Sezer on </p><p>Nov. 7 Baykal declared that CHP will support amending the </p><p>constitution\'s Art. 76 -- which could pave the way for the </p><p>restoration of Erdogan\'s political rights.  Meanwhile, the </p><p>Kemalist "Cumhuriyet" daily, CHP\'s de facto mouthpiece, </p><p>sought to reassure Establishment voters through Nov. 7 </p><p>headlines trumpeting the reactivation of the "West Working </p><p>Group" -- which was in the forefront of the "February 28 </p><p>Process" under which the Islamist-led government of Prime </p><p>Minister Erbakan was ousted in 1997.  The key question is </p><p>whether Baykal, aware of the voters\' desire for change, will </p><p>allow his pragmatic streak to prevail over the combative </p><p>traits and Establishment pressures that, over time, may </p><p>encourage him to sharpen differences between a "secularist" </p><p>CHP and the "Islamic" AK. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
