<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 006444 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>ROME FOR CASLO </p><p>USDOC/4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, AMGT, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: DELTA DISCUSSES CODESHARING WITH ROYAL JORDANIAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. PLEASE PROTECT BUSINESS </p><p>INFORMATION.  NOT FOR INTERNET. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary.  A Delta sales executive left Amman this </p><p>week saying that he was prepared to make a positive </p><p>presentation to Delta President Fred Reid on codesharing for </p><p>Royal Jordanian\'s new non-stop Amman-New York service.  He </p><p>asked RJ to provide detailed projections of passenger and </p><p>cargo loads to support such a case, which would include </p><p>projections of potential USG travel.  Delta is also working </p><p>with Air France to improve the quality of service on their </p><p>current codeshare between Paris and Amman, which is heavily </p><p>used by U.S. government travelers and has been plagued by </p><p>problems with lost and delayed luggage.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Jimmy Eichelgruen, Delta Airline\'s London-based </p><p>GSA sales manager for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was </p><p>in Amman on October 29 for meetings with Royal Jordanian </p><p>Airlines (RJ).  The main subject was RJ\'s requests for a </p><p>codeshare arrangement with Delta.  Eichelgruen came with the </p><p>message that given the financial difficulties the U.S. </p><p>airline is currently facing, Delta saw this as a time for </p><p>consolidation, not new ventures.  He added that Delta was </p><p>willing to look at improvements in its existing interline </p><p>agreement with Royal Jordanian, short of a full-fledge </p><p>codeshare agreement. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Eichelgruen\'s meeting with RJ CEO Samer al-Majali </p><p>seemed, however, to make progress toward a codeshare </p><p>arrangement.  Majali described the advantages that would </p><p>accrue to Delta of RJ\'s plans to expand its role as an </p><p>aviation hub for the Levant countries, using a new fleet of </p><p>long and short range jets.  In addition, Majali argued that </p><p>RJ\'s new non-stop Amman-New York service, for which Delta </p><p>currently provides ground services at its JFK terminal, would </p><p>be a natural feeder for domestic Delta flights in the United </p><p>States.  He highlighted what he called the poor quality of </p><p>current service to Amman by European carriers. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Eichelgruen told Majali that the fact that Delta </p><p>currently codeshares with Air France between Paris and Amman </p><p>would not be inconsistent with a possible codeshare with RJ </p><p>to the United States.  He asked Majali and his staff to </p><p>provide more detailed information on projected passenger and </p><p>cargo traffic that he could use to make what he said would be </p><p>a presentation with a positive recommendation to Delta </p><p>President Fred Reid.  Eichelgruen said that projected </p><p>revenues from U.S. government travel to Jordan and to the </p><p>region should be part of that presentation.  He asked for the </p><p>Embassy\'s help in estimating the amount of such travel. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Eichelgrun also met with Ambassador Gnehm and </p><p>embassy staff.  We reviewed the embassy\'s unhappiness with </p><p>the level of service on the current Air France/Delta </p><p>codeshare flight to Amman, in particular chronic problems </p><p>with lost and delayed luggage.  Eichelgrun said that Delta </p><p>was unhappy with this aspect of its relationship with Air </p><p>France and had let Air France know it.  He said transfer </p><p>problems at Charles de Gaulle airport were hurting all of </p><p>Delta\'s business in the Middle East region.  Delta and Air </p><p>France were currently working to address the multiple causes </p><p>for the problems at CDG. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The Ambassador also highlighted our interest in </p><p>seeing RJ find a codeshare arrangement with a U.S. airline </p><p>for the non-stop Amman-New York service.  This would be a </p><p>vehicle for the growing business travel and air cargo traffic </p><p>under the various bilateral trade initiatives, as well as a </p><p>concrete symbol of closeness of the bilateral relationship. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
