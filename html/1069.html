(C) AS CURRENTLY INVOKED BY PRESIDENT MUGABE AND </p><p>SENIOR RULING ZANU-PF PARTY OFFICIALS, THE LAND REFORM </p><p>ISSUE IS A CANARD.  IN OUR JUDGMENT, THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PRESIDENT AND PARTY DO NOT WANT A NEAR TERM RESOLUTION </p><p>TO THE LAND QUESTION, BUT RATHER WANT TO KEEP THE </p><p>SITUATION ON THE GROUND UNSETTLED.  CONSEQUENTLY, WHILE </p><p>WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO URGE THE GOZ TO RETURN TO THE </p><p>AGREEMENTS REACHED AT THE SEPTEMBER 1998 DONORS\' </p><p>CONFERENCE, WE SHOULD NOT SEARCH FOR NEW OFFERS TO PUT </p><p>ON THE TABLE, IN RESPONSE TO MUGABE\'S BLACKMAIL.  THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT IS BANKING ON THE FACT THAT BETWEEN </p><p>APPEALING TO BLACK NATIONALIST SENTIMENT AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02221  01 OF 04  251426Z </p><p>INTIMIDATING WHITES, AND, INCREASINGLY MORE BRUTALLY, </p><p>BLACK FARM WORKERS, HIS PARTY WILL WIN THE STILL </p><p>UNSCHEDULED PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  FROM THE LITTLE WE </p><p>HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ELICIT ON THE SUBJECT, REGIONAL </p><p>LEADERS MEETING MUGABE IN VICTORIA FALLS ON APRIL 22 </p><p>LIKELY SAID THAT THE SPECTACLE OF VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE </p><p>AND ITS ATTENDANT BAD PUBLICITY WAS HURTING THE SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICAN REGION.  WE ARE CONCERNED THAT MUGABE MAY HAVE </p><p>INTERPRETED THEIR MESSAGE TO MEAN THAT HE MUST KEEP HIS </p><p>INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN BELOW THE RADAR SCREEN.  WE THINK </p><p>MUGABE MIGHT YIELD TO INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IF IT COMES FROM A GROUP LIKE THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH.  WE SHOULD HELP FACILITATE THAT, ALTHOUGH </p><p>NOT TAKE THE LEAD.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE SHOULD CONTINUE </p><p>OUR OWN CAMPAIGN OF QUIET DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE ON THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT COMBINED WITH EFFORTS AIMED AT BUILDING </p><p>BRIDGES AMONG POLITICAL ADVERSARIES IN ZIMBABWE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE IS A SMOKESCREEN </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ROBERT MUGABE HAS RESUSCITATED HIS OLD STANDBY, </p><p>THE LAND ISSUE, AS A WAY TO DRUM UP NATIONALIST </p><p>SENTIMENT AND GARNER VOTES IN THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTION.  IN OUR RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND WITH FOREIGN MINISTER STANISLAUS MUDENGE </p><p>WE HAVE REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT, AS CURRENTLY USED </p><p>BY THE SENIOR ZANU-PF LEADERSHIP, THE ISSUE IS LITTLE </p><p>MORE THAN A SMOKESCREEN AND ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02221  01 OF 04  251426Z </p><p>INTIMIDATE AND DIRECT THE NATION.  SUGGESTING STEPS THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT MIGHT TAKE, AMBASSADOR MCDONALD </p><p>ASKED PRESIDENT MUGABE POINT BLANK WHETHER HE WAS </p><p>INTERESTED IN RESULTS OR POLITICKING.  THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>CHIEF EXECUTIVE DEMURRED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) IN OUR VIEW, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE LAND AND ITS </p><p>WHITE OWNERSHIP IS BEING USED AS A VERY BLUNT POLITICAL </p><p>INSTRUMENT BY MUGABE, WHO HAS PERSONALLY TAKEN CHARGE OF </p><p>THE ISSUE, TO BLUDGEON THE NATION TO DECLARE ITS NEAR- </p><p>UNANIMOUS FEALTY TO HIMSELF.  IF THE GOAL OF JUST LAND </p><p>REFORM WERE TO BE PURSUED HONESTLY AND WITH DUE CONCERN </p><p>FOR ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY </p><p>CONCERNS, THE PRINCIPLES AND ACTION PLAN HAMMERED OUT IN </p><p>THE SEPTEMBER 1998 LAND DONORS CONFERENCE WOULD BE </p><p>ADHERED TO.  THEY, HOWEVER, HAVE BEEN CAST ASIDE ALONG </p><p>WITH DUE PROCESS, LAW AND ORDER ENFORCEMENT AND RESPECT </p><p>FOR THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.  APPROPRIATE LAND REFORM IS A </p><p>MATTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, BUT THERE IS NO ECONOMIC CASE </p><p>FOR WILLY-NILLY LAND REDISTRIBUTION.  IN FACT THE </p><p>OPPOSITE IS TRUE, AS THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS ARE </p><p>EFFICIENT AND PRODUCE THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>EXPORT EARNINGS WHILE LOOKING AFTER THE ASSET.  THE </p><p>POLITICAL ELEMENT IS STRONG, ESPECIALLY BEFORE AN </p><p>ELECTION WHERE THERE IS A VIABLE OPPOSITION AND WHEN THE </p><p>MANIFESTATIONS OF THE ECONOMIC CALAMITY WROUGHT BY </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO9667 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02221  02 OF 04  251426Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  COME-00 </p><p>      CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-01   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-01    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     AC-01 </p><p>      NEA-00   NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  SA-00    R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------4FA764  251426Z /38 </p><p>O 251430Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5843 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 002221 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR SA/INS - STEVEN KRAFT </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR A/AID R.

THESE ARE MADE WORSE BY THE REALIZATION THAT </p><p>TWENTY YEARS OF PROMISES TO THE PEASANTRY ON LAND </p><p>REDISTRIBUTION HAS ONLY SEEN MUGABE\'S CRONIES BECOME </p><p>SOME OF THE LARGEST LAND OWNERS OF ALL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) OBSERVERS AND PARTICIPANTS ON ALL SIDES AGREE </p><p>THAT PROGRESS SINCE THE SEPTEMBER 1998 CONFERENCE HAS </p><p>BEEN SLOWER THAN ENVISIONED.  THE GOZ\'S SMALL BUDGET </p><p>ALLOCATION DID NOT GO FAR, A FACT THAT SLOWED DOWN DONOR </p><p>SUPPORT.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR IN A </p><p>SEPARATE MEETING APRIL 22 THAT THE SEPTEMBER 1998 LAND </p><p>DONORS\' CONFERENCE WAS NOT ONLY A WASTE OF TIME BUT A </p><p>"FAILURE," STATING THAT SINCE THE DONORS DID NOT PONY UP </p><p>CASH TO BUY LAND, ZIMBABWE\'S INTERESTS WERE NOT MET BY </p><p>IT.  MUDENGE CONTINUED, "WHAT PROGRESS HAVE WE SEEN ON </p><p>LAND ACQUISITION SINCE THE CONFERENCE?  NONE.  THE </p><p>FARMERS HAVE BLOCKED IT IN THE COURTS AND THE BRITISH </p><p>HAVE ACTIVELY STOPPED THE WORLD BANK FROM PROVIDING </p><p>FUNDS.  NOW, WITH THE NEW LAW, WE WILL FINALLY HAVE </p><p>PROGRESS." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02221  02 OF 04  251426Z </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>MOVING THE GOALPOSTS AND STIRRING THE POT </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THERE ALSO HAS BEEN MOVEMENT ON THE FARM </p><p>INVASION FRONT.  INITIALLY, SENIOR GOVERNMENT MINISTERS </p><p>ASSURED US THE WAR VETERANS OCCUPATION WOULD BE RESOLVED </p><p>ONCE THE CONSTITUTION WAS AMENDED WITH A LAND CLAUSE. </p><p>NOW THE GOAL POSTS HAVE MOVED: THE INVASIONS WILL BE </p><p>CALLED OFF WHEN 841 PREVIOUSLY DESIGNATED FARMS, WHOSE </p><p>DESIGNATION WAS CHALLENGED IN COURT, ARE WILLINGLY </p><p>TURNED OVER TO THE GOVERNMENT WITHOUT CONCERN FOR THE </p><p>PETTY DETAIL OF PAYMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) MUGABE AND COMPANY HAVE A STAKE IN KEEPING THE </p><p>TEMPERATURE HIGH ON THIS TOPIC.  HE IS SENDING THREE </p><p>CABINET MEMBERS, INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE MINISTER NATHAN </p><p>SHAMUYARIRA, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND HOUSING MINISTER JOHN </p><p>NKOMO AND MUDENGE, TO LONDON TO DISCUSS A COMPENSATION </p><p>PLAN WITH THE BRITISH.  HE KNOWS THAT THE TALKS WILL END </p><p>IN FAILURE BECAUSE HE HAS MADE MAXIMALIST DEMANDS THAT </p><p>SIMPLY CANNOT BE MET: FULL PAYMENT FOR 5 MILLION </p><p>HECTARES OF LAND TO CONSUMMATE HIS LAND REFORM AND </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM (THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>COLLECTIVELY OWN ABOUT 11 MILLION HECTARES).  WE WOULD </p><p>WAGER THAT THE MINISTERS ARE GOING WITH THE INSTRUCTION </p><p>TO BRING HOME ALL OR NOTHING.  IF THOSE TALKS FAIL, </p><p>MUGABE COULD WELL POINT OUT TO HIS DOMESTIC </p><p>CONSTITUENCY, "YOU SEE, IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME TO TALK </p><p>TO THE BRITISH," AND PERHAPS ORDER AN EVEN MORE </p><p>INTENSIFIED INVASION OF WHITE-OWNED LAND. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02221  02 OF 04  251426Z </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>DOES MUGABE REALLY CONTROL THE WAR VETERANS? </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) JUST HOW MUCH CONTROL OVER THE "WAR VETERANS" </p><p>MUGABE ACTUALLY HAS IS NOW THE 64,000 DOLLAR QUESTION. </p><p>OCCUPATIONS OCCUR IN WAVES IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY, WHILE IN OTHER PARTS IT\'S QUIET.  POLICE AND </p><p>OTHER SECURITY SERVICE MEMBERS SEEM TO WATCH THE GOINGS </p><p>ON WITHOUT HINDERING IT, BUT OCCASIONALLY COACH THE "WAR </p><p>VETERANS" ON WHAT FARMS TO TAKE AND WHICH TO AVOID. </p><p>INSTEAD OF RELYING ON THE GOVERNMENT OR PARTY TO </p><p>TRANSPORT THEM, WAR VETERANS NOW HAVE "REQUISITIONED" </p><p>VEHICLES FROM THE PROPERTIES THEY\'VE OCCUPIED FOR </p><p>MOBILITY.  MOREOVER, EMBOLDENED BY THE PROTECTION THEY </p><p>HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR MISDEEDS, </p><p>THE WAR VETERANS HAVE TAKEN TO ISSUING THREATS ON WHICH </p><p>THEY DELIVER.  THE TWO WHITE FARMERS RECEIVED DEATH </p><p>THREATS BEFORE THEY WERE KILLED.  INDIVIDUALS NAMED IN A </p><p>PURPORTED WAR VETERANS\' HIT LIST, INCLUDING BUSINESSMEN </p><p>STRIVE MASIYIWA, NIGEL CHANAKIRA, EDDIE CROSS AND ERIC </p><p>BLOCH, TAKE THE THREATS SERIOUSLY.

(C) THE LESSENING -- FOR NOW -- OF ATTACKS ON WHITE </p><p>FARMERS IS WELCOME, BUT THIS HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>CONTINUING OCCUPATIONS OF FARMS AND NEW OCCUPATIONS OF </p><p>PREVIOUSLY UNTOUCHED PROPERTIES.  MOREOVER, THERE HAS </p><p>BEEN AN APPARENT TACTICAL SHIFT.  AS IF RECOGNIZING THAT </p><p>THE WHITE FARMERS ARE A MINISCULE PART OF THE </p><p>ELECTORATE, INTIMIDATION NOW SEEMS FOCUSED ON THE BLACK </p><p>FARM WORKERS, WHOSE LARGE NUMBERS MAKE THEIR VOTING </p><p>PREFERENCE, IN A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION, THE REAL PRIZE. </p><p>THESE WORKERS APPEAR TO HAVE SUFFERED INCREASING NUMBERS </p><p>OF BEATINGS, BURNINGS, MUTILATIONS, AND VERBAL THREATS </p><p>IN RECENT DAYS.  ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTS REACHING THE </p><p>PRESS AND SOURCES OF THE EMBASSY, THESE ATTACKS HAVE </p><p>BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY WARNINGS THAT AFFILIATION WITH THE </p><p>MDC IS WHAT PLACES PEOPLE AT RISK; BY RECANTING AND </p><p>SUPPORTING ZANU-PF PEOPLE CAN BUY PROTECTION.  IN ONE OF </p><p>THE LESS VIOLENT INCIDENTS COVERED IN THE LOCAL PRESS, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, ZANU-PF WORKERS DUG A PIT THEY TERMED </p><p>"TSVANGIRAI\'S GRAVE," AND FORCED FARM WORKERS TO THROW </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02221  03 OF 04  251426Z </p><p>INTO IT ALL THEIR MDC MEMBERSHIP CARDS, STICKERS, </p><p>PLACARDS, AND SO FORTH, WHICH THEN WERE BURNED. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>THE NEIGHBORS WEIGH IN </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT TRANSPIRED BETWEEN REGIONAL </p><p>LEADERS ON THE ZIMBABWE LAND OCCUPATION ISSUE AT THE </p><p>RECENT VICTORIA FALLS CONFERENCE, BECAUSE THE GOZ </p><p>REFUSES TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT WITH US (REF A).  WE </p><p>SUSPECT, HOWEVER, THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN AT LEAST A </p><p>SUGGESTION FROM THE REGIONAL LEADERS THAT THE </p><p>OCCUPATIONS, VIOLENCE AND THE ATTENDANT BAD PUBLICITY </p><p>ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE REGION.   PRESIDENT MBEKI, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, FACES LIKELY ECONOMIC FALLOUT FROM AN </p><p>ACCELERATION OF THE ZIMBABWE MESS, AND ALREADY HAS FELT </p><p>THE IMPACT OF THE WORLD PERCEPTION OF THE PROBLEM AS </p><p>BEING ONE FOR ALL OF SOUTHERN AFRICA (REF B).  U.S. </p><p>POLICYMAKERS, HOWEVER, MUST BE ALERT TO THE POSSIBILITY </p><p>THAT THIS MESSAGE, HOWEVER DELIVERED, WAS INTERPRETED BY </p><p>MUGABE TO MEAN THAT PUBLICITY ABOUT ATTACKS AND CHAOS </p><p>WAS THE BAD THING.  BY SEEKING TO FRIGHTEN THE LARGELY </p><p>VOICELESS BLACK FARM WORKERS, MUGABE MAY HAVE THUS FOUND </p><p>A MEANS TO SLIP HIS CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATION BELOW THE </p><p>RADAR SCREEN OF WORLD PRESS AND REGIONAL LEADERS, AND </p><p>MEET HIS NEIGHBORS\' CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>WHAT IS TO BE DONE? </p><p>------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02221  03 OF 04  251426Z </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT MUGABE DOES YIELD TO </p><p>PUBLIC PRESSURE.  REGIONAL LEADERS HAVE TOLD HIM TO </p><p>ALTER HIS BEHAVIOR AND FROM EARLY SIGNS HE HAS, ALTHOUGH </p><p>TO A MORE SINISTER MODE.  IN ADDITION TO REMAINING </p><p>ENGAGED WITH MUGABE AND ALL RELEVANT FIGURES ACROSS THE </p><p>POLITICAL SPECTRUM HERE, WE MUST KEEP HIS FEET TO THE </p><p>FIRE THAT HIS CAMPAIGN IS UNACCEPTABLE.  WE HAVE ALREADY </p><p>RECOMMENDED THAT THE PRESIDENT PLACE A CALL IN THIS </p><p>CONNECTION TO MUGABE.  IN ADDITION TO MUGABE HEARING </p><p>FROM HIS NEIGHBORS AND OURSELVES, A SIMILAR MESSAGE IS </p><p>LIKELY TO BE FORTHCOMING FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, </p><p>POSSIBLY DELIVERED IN PERSON BY A TROIKA CONSISTING OF </p><p>THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF PORTUGAL AND FRANCE AND THE </p><p>HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION.  WHILE THE LATTER ARE </p><p>DOING THE RIGHT THING, THEIR ACTION IS LIKELY TO HAVE </p><p>MINIMAL IMPACT, AS THE MESSAGE WILL BE FROM THE RICH </p><p>WHITE MAN\'S CLUB.  A TOUGH MESSAGE THAT MUGABE CANNOT </p><p>CONTINUE TO HIDE BEHIND A LEGITIMATE DEVELOPMENT ISSUE </p><p>IN ORDER TO COMMIT CRIMES FROM THE COMMONWEALTH, </p><p>HOWEVER, MIGHT BE THE WAY TO GO.
