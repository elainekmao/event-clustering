<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 001253 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON THE ARAB SUMMIT AND THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S 02/26 SPEECH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead coverage in all papers March 2-3 is dedicated </p><p>to the Arab summit meeting in Sharm el-Shaikh.  All </p><p>papers March 2 carry banner headlines highlighting the </p><p>summit meeting\'s final communiqu declaring </p><p>"rejection" of military action against Iraq.  All </p><p>papers also highlight details of King Abdullah\'s </p><p>speech to the summit meeting.  Majority of editorial </p><p>commentary March 2 reiterates the King\'s remarks </p><p>stressing the need to "use all means to spare this </p><p>region a war".  Other commentaries focus on the </p><p>success of the summit in achieving a "unified" Arab </p><p>stand against a war on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>        Editorial Commentary on The Arab Summit </p><p> </p><p>-- "Serious talks at the Sharm el-Shaikh summit" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Tarek Masarweh writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/03):  "The categorical Arab agreement against the </p><p>war says something more serious than that.  It is </p><p>saying that the American and British presence on Arab </p><p>territories is, from a practical viewpoint, an </p><p>occupation.  Since Kuwait, Saudi, Qatar and Bahrain </p><p>reject the war that the United States and Britain mean </p><p>to wage against Iraq, then the military build-up on </p><p>their territories.is an abuse of security treaties, </p><p>which were approved for the purpose of protecting </p><p>(these countries)  against outside aggression, and not </p><p>for the purpose of becoming bases and launch-pads for </p><p>aggression against neighboring countries." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The summit\'s decisions, who will buy them?" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Sultan Hattab writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/03):  "The United States does not want advice on </p><p>what it needs to do from the Arab summit.  It rather </p><p>wants the Arab summit to help carry out American </p><p>schemes.  Since this did not happen, it is expected </p><p>that the United States will either respond to the </p><p>summit\'s decisions or completely ignore them, and turn </p><p>its attention to its bilateral contacts and </p><p>relationships with Arab countries and to what has </p><p>already been achieved in those areas and not stated in </p><p>the summit\'s communiqu..  The war is coming and the </p><p>Arab summit\'s decisions are powerless and lack action. </p><p>They have come too late." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The summit of fears and contradictions and </p><p>agreement" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(03/03):  "The only value of the Sharm el-Shaikh </p><p>communiqu is that it has shown all the Arabs </p><p>rejecting the war.  Despite the fact that American </p><p>armies will in reality launch operations from Arab </p><p>territories, the consensus agreement gives the </p><p>impression that the United States is abusing its </p><p>security agreements with the Arab countries to serve </p><p>its own wars and interests that contradict the </p><p>interests and desires of the Arabs.  Arab leaders had </p><p>their backs against a wall and they would not have </p><p>been able to survive the failure of the summit </p><p>meeting.  They had no choice but to agree to the final </p><p>communiqu.  This shows that the Arab countries feel </p><p>that the war on Iraq carries so much danger for </p><p>themselves that they have to put aside their conflicts </p><p>and disagreements.  Everyone in Sharm el-Shaikh was </p><p>realistic, particularly after President Bush\'s most </p><p>recent speech where he said that Iraq would be the </p><p>beginning of change in the Middle East.  This means </p><p>s </p><p>that America\'s intervention in the future of Arab </p><p>regimes will not be limited to Iraq and Palestine but </p><p>will affect other Arab countries..  The summit can be </p><p>described as a summit of pressures, worry, fear, </p><p>conflicts and contradictions, but it did breakthrough </p><p>towards a unified stand of rejecting the war.  This, </p><p>in itself, is important because it denies Washington </p><p>legitimacy for its war." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  Editorial Commentary on President Bush 02/26 Speech </p><p> </p><p>-- "Nothing but a promise" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Dr. Musa Keilani writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (03/02):  "U.S. President George W. </p><p>Bush\'s promise to turn his attention to Palestine </p><p>after Iraq . reminds us of a similar pledge by his </p><p>father in 1990 ad of what actually happened since </p><p>then.  Indeed, Bush the father fulfilled half of that </p><p>pledge by arranging the 1991 Middle East peace </p><p>conference in Madrid where what was then described as </p><p>historic peace talks began between the Arabs and </p><p>Israel.  What do we have in our sights today to expect </p><p>a situation different under Bush the son?  We have yet </p><p>to see a commitment on the part of Bush Jr. to ending </p><p>the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and we see it as </p><p>unlikely that Washington has new ideas to advance this </p><p>quest.  Bush\'s promise is not worth much unless </p><p>accompanied by a clear outline of the process that </p><p>would lead to the realization of the quartet\'s </p><p>`roadmap for peace\'.  We do appreciate that the </p><p>ultimate point in that `roadmap\' is a Palestinian </p><p>state.  But we have no idea what it would take for the </p><p>Palestinians to get there.  More importantly, we have </p><p>no assurance that pressure would be applied on Israeli </p><p>to accept reason, logic, international legitimacy and </p><p>a desire for peace based on the genuine rights of the </p><p>Palestinians..  Until and unless we see concrete signs </p><p>of a paradigm shift in the U.S. approach and </p><p>Washington\'s acceptance of the truth that it is its </p><p>blind backing for Israel that has distorted any </p><p>sincere and honest search for peace, we are afraid </p><p>that Bush\'s promise is nothing but just that - a </p><p>promise." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Bush and the `post-war speech\'" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/02):  "The `post-war speech\' delivered by the U.S. </p><p>President at the American Enterprise Institute </p><p>sketched the outlines of U.S. strategy in the Middle </p><p>East and highlighted the principles of `post-Saddam </p><p>Hussein Iraq\'..  A federal, democratic, modern Iraq, </p><p>serving to bring security and stability to the region, </p><p>providing the example for political reform for the </p><p>entire Middle East; an Iraq that will  be able to </p><p>export oil to world markets and add a modern ruling </p><p>regime to the Middle East.  An Iraq of this kind </p><p>cannot be under occupation and military rule, unless </p><p>we are talking about a short transitional period.  An </p><p>Iraq that lives under American generals or even </p><p>civilian rulers could become an agent for the </p><p>Americans, and then with time turn into the core of </p><p>instability in the region and a source for a new wave </p><p>of terrorism.  Our problem with the `American vision\' </p><p>of Iraq lies in three aspects:  The first is that the </p><p>advancement of Iraqi democracy will not replace the </p><p>need for advancement on the Palestinian political </p><p>track.  The second is that U.S. policy in general has </p><p>always been characterized by pragmatism and a short </p><p>attention span.  It is not unlikely that Washington </p><p>would renege on all its pledges and promises at the </p><p>first signs of a crisis or resistance.  The third </p><p>aspect is that U.S. foreign policy is greatly </p><p>influenced by domestic calculations and considerations </p><p>that are determined by opportunist pressure groups </p><p>that have their own interests to serve." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
