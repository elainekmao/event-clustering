<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000659 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR POL -- J. MAXSTADT </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, MOPS, EPET, ASEC, CASC, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NAVY MINISTER SAYS MILITARY MUST TAKE </p><p>STRONG STAND IN THE DELTA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 236 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During a March 27 meeting with Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, Minister of State for Defense (Navy) Chris Agbobu </p><p>discussed the recent violence in Delta State.  He </p><p>attributed the fighting to political power struggles </p><p>between the Ijaw and Itsekiri ethnic groups, Ijaw </p><p>dissatisfaction with Delta State Governor James Ibori, and </p><p>Ijaw illegal oil bunkering.  Agbobu claimed Ijaw "youth" </p><p>used money from illegal bunkering to acquire small arms and </p><p>some heavy weapons.  These weapons and the overall weakness </p><p>of the military and police forces in Delta State have </p><p>emboldened the militants.  Agbobu believed only a show of </p><p>force by the military would resolve the matter.  He </p><p>suggested the navy hold "exercises" to demonstrate the </p><p>GON\'s power to impose peace in the region as a way to push </p><p>the Ijaws toward dialogue.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>VIOLENCE IN THE DELTA </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a March 27 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Minister of State for Defense (Navy) Chris Agbobu discussed </p><p>the causes of and possible solutions to the recent violence </p><p>in Delta State.  Agbobu described the causes of the </p><p>violence as "two fronts."  First, long-standing disputes </p><p>between Ijaw and Itsekiri over the creation of new Local </p><p>Government Areas (LGAs) had created friction between the </p><p>two ethnic groups.  The situation has been further inflamed </p><p>by Delta State Governor James Ibori\'s support for the </p><p>creation of new LGAs, favoring the Itsekiri. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The second, and perhaps most important cause, </p><p>according to Agbobu, is Ijaw oil bunkering.  Agbobu claimed </p><p>the Ijaw used their illicit profits to purchase weapons. </p><p>Agbobu did not know the source of the weapons, but </p><p>hypothesized they were being shipped into Nigeria on the </p><p>very same ships that smuggled the bunkered oil out. </p><p>Calling the Ijaw "terrorists," Agbobu said their attacks on </p><p>the Itsekiri were designed to divert the GON\'s </p><p>military/police task force in Delta State from the Ijaw\'s </p><p>illegal bunkering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Lamenting the condition of the Navy and that Ijaw </p><p>fighters were often better armed than the military, Agbobu </p><p>said only a show of force by the military would deter the </p><p>Ijaw\'s continued aggression.  He suggested that the </p><p>military conduct "exercises" to demonstrate that the GON </p><p>could impose peace in the region if militants did not </p><p>submit to government authority.  Agbobu complained that </p><p>Obasanjo\'s ultimatum to local combatants that they </p><p>immediately cease all attacks and hand over those guilty of </p><p>perpetrating prior violence was merely "Abuja talk."  "How </p><p>would the President enforce the ultimatum," Agbobu asked? </p><p>Agbobu said the President should refit the Navy and supply </p><p>soldiers and police with the tools they need to combat </p><p>lawlessness in the Delta. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>U.S. SECURITY ASSISTANCE AND BENUE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Turning to U.S. security assistance, the Ambassador </p><p>told Agbobu that the suspension of the IMET and FMF </p><p>portions of the U.S./Nigeria Defense Cooperation program </p><p>had nothing to do with the GON\'s position on the war in </p><p>Iraq.  The Ambassador explained the funds were withdrawn </p><p>because the GON had not made sufficient progress in </p><p>bringing to justice those responsible for the October 2001 </p><p>civilian massacre at Zaki-Biam, Benue State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Agbobu said U.S. assistance was the "bedrock of </p><p>reforming the Ministry of Defense" and he was sorry to see </p><p>the program diminished.  While Agbobu accepted that the </p><p>assistance suspension had nothing to do with Iraq, he was </p><p>quick to criticize the U.S. position on Benue.  Agbobu </p><p>spoke emotionally about the killing and mutilation of the </p><p>19 soldiers that precipitated the massacre in Benue.  He </p><p>expressed great concern that no one seemed to care about </p><p>the fate of the soldiers.  Driving his point home, the </p><p>Minister said, "If I were President (Zaki-Biam) would have </p><p>been erased." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Agbobu said he did not think the soldiers at Zaki- </p><p>Biam acted with the sanction of higher command.  He </p><p>believed after seeing what happened to their comrades, the </p><p>soldiers did not need orders to act.  Discussing the status </p><p>of the GON\'s investigation into the Benue incident, Agbobu </p><p>said the military would overthrow President Obasanjo if he </p><p>indicted any officer for his role in the massacre. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Agbobu\'s influence in the military may not be as </p><p>great as his position implies.  He is a political appointee </p><p>selected to insure ethnic balance in the MOD.  However, his </p><p>opinions on both the Delta and Benue are probably </p><p>representative of opinions both in the military hierarchy </p><p>and the rank-and-file.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
