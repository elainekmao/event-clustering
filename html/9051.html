<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001692 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, PGOV, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: MAJOR COCAINE SEIZURE IN GUATEMALAN HIGHLANDS </p><p> </p><p>1. At 09:45 local time on June 27 a Bell 212 helicopter </p><p>carrying 757 kilos of cocaine crashed near the town of San </p><p>Francisco el Alto, in Totonicapan Department, near the border </p><p>with Mexico.  Its three crew members, injured in the crash, </p><p>escaped and remain at large.  Local police immediately </p><p>arrived at the scene and informed the SAIA (Guatemalan </p><p>counter-drug police) and the Public Ministry, which came and </p><p>took charge of the drugs and the investigation.  The cocaine </p><p>was transferred to the SAIA headquarters in Guatemala City </p><p>where it is being cataloged as evidence before being </p><p>destroyed.  Minister of Government Reyes Calderon told </p><p>reporters that the SAIA had knowledge of and was </p><p>investigating this cocaine shipment, which was destined for </p><p>Mexico and had apparently been delayed by bad weather. </p><p> </p><p>2.  This seizure brings the GOG\'s total cocaine seizures for </p><p>the first six months of 2003 to 3,668 kilos (611 kilos a </p><p>month); up from a total of 2,400 kilos seized in all of 2002. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
