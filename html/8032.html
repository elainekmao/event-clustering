Local NGOs </p><p>have been active in anti-corruption issues, and the World </p><p>Bank began a program in 2001 working on judicial reform and </p><p>corruption issues. </p><p> </p><p>While Yemen has fundamentally sound investment laws, labor </p><p>laws, customs tariff regulations and tax laws, transparency </p><p>of implementation and enforcement is elusive.  The next steps </p><p>required in Yemen\'s civil service and administrative reform </p><p>process are to clarify procedures, create implementing </p><p>regulations and build a mechanism to enforce these standards. </p><p> The formal judicial system is widely regarded as inefficient </p><p>and corrupt.  Parliament has not passed a pending financial </p><p>disclosure law, and Central Bank oversight of government </p><p>accounting practices is considered weak.  End Answer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>N.
