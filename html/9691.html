<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001904 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR WHA/CEN AND WHA/USOAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ASEC, PHUM, KDEM, PINR, PINS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: FRG PROTESTS CONTINUE </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1900 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 pro-Rios Montt protesters </p><p>remained overnight at several locations in the capital and </p><p>continue to surround the Constitutional Court, the Supreme </p><p>Court, and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal building.  A tense </p><p>calm has returned to Guatemala City for the moment, with very </p><p>light traffic flowing and no tires burning as of 8:30 a.m. </p><p>local time.  Radio reports indicate that busses with FRG </p><p>supporters have left Coban, Totonicapan and the south coast </p><p>bringing more protesters into Guatemala City.  Protests are </p><p>expected to resume later this morning. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Around 6:00 PM, July 24, security forces successfully </p><p>evacuated some 900 people from a commercial center owned by </p><p>opposition financier Dionisio Gutierrez.  Protesters later </p><p>withdrew from the entrance of La Canada, allowing numerous </p><p>officials, politicians, and diplomats to reach their </p><p>residences.  All U.S. mission personnel were able to spend </p><p>the night in their own homes. The Embassy opened on July 25 </p><p>with essential personnel only. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Rios Montt gave a press conference at 8:00 PM on July </p><p>24 in which he implausibly denied that the disturbances were </p><p>organized by "the Executive Committee of the FRG," while </p><p>acknowledging that the protesters were his supporters.  He </p><p>dodged questions about the activities of FRG Congressmen, </p><p>such as Juan Santa Cruz, who were shown on television </p><p>coordinating activities of the protesters. When asked why the </p><p>FRG protesters had targeted the offices of Dionisio </p><p>Gutierrez, he said "I didn\'t send them to (Gutierrez\'s </p><p>office), I told them to go to the Supreme Court."  Caught in </p><p>the apparent contradiction with his earlier statement that he </p><p>had not been involved in the organization of the protests, </p><p>his handlers called an immediate end to the press conference </p><p>and removed the 76 year old former general from the room. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) President Portillo gave a seven minute address to the </p><p>nation on the afternoon of July 24, saying that the police </p><p>and army would maintain order and protect private property. </p><p>There was a noticeable absence of police, however, throughout </p><p>the day at most protest locations. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) On the evening of July 24, the Ambassador met with </p><p>representatives of civil society, the private sector and </p><p>political parties (at their request).  Participants, whose </p><p>spirits were clearly inflamed by the violent events of the </p><p>day, accused the GOG of being complicit along with the FRG in </p><p>the violence, noting that despite public assurances from </p><p>President Portillo and Minister of Government Reyes Calderon, </p><p>police did nothing to stop the violence.  Many saw the </p><p>violent protests as aimed at intimidating the opposition by </p><p>showing them that the FRG knows where they live and work, and </p><p>the police will do nothing to protect them.  Several civil </p><p>society leaders noted that the FRG\'s willingness to use </p><p>violence makes it important that the election observation </p><p>effort be expanded.  Others said it was time for the OAS to </p><p>call a special Permanent Council session and invoke the </p><p>Democratic Charter.  The Ambassador told the opposition, </p><p>civil society and private sector leaders that our efforts in </p><p>the immediate term would be aimed at securing the restoration </p><p>of public order, and that following the return of normalcy it </p><p>would be important to take stock of where the electoral </p><p>process stands. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Ambassador is seeking meetings on July 25 with </p><p>Foreign Minister Gutierrez, Minister of Government Calderon, </p><p>and National Pol </p><p></p></div>
