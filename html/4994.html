<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000029 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON WWII REMAINS RECOVERY IN BURMA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CHIEF OF MISSION CARMEN M. MARTINEZ; REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The recovery of the remains of some 600 </p><p>WWII missing personnel (mostly crews of aircraft that crashed </p><p>while flying "the hump" from India to China) is an important </p><p>USG priority in Burma.  With fairly good cooperation from the </p><p>Government of Burma, the recovery operation is moving ahead </p><p>more or less on schedule.  The limited availability of </p><p>helicopters this dry season is a major obstacle and has </p><p>probably reduced significantly the operation\'s chances of </p><p>dramatic success in the initial phases.  There are many </p><p>policy and public diplomacy minefields that Post will try to </p><p>help the operation avoid while working in this sensitive </p><p>area.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) PROGRESS TO DATE:  Following the September 2002 </p><p>framework agreement reached between visiting DASD Jennings </p><p>and S1 General Khin Nyunt, three Burmese officials traveled </p><p>to the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory, Hawaii </p><p>(CILHI) for a familiarization visit.  A well-attended Joint </p><p>Planning Meeting held in Rangoon in October ironed out many </p><p>technical details of the operation.  The U.S. side included </p><p>CILHI, DoD\'s Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office </p><p>(DPMO), and Embassy Rangoon -- both State and DAO.  A health </p><p>and logistics advance team visited Burma in December to </p><p>establish medevac and other logistical procedures.  The team </p><p>to scout out potential recovery sites, the Investigative </p><p>Element (IE), is scheduled to arrive in Rangoon January 12. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) THE IMPORTANCE OF HELICOPTERS:  Most of the </p><p>probable crash sites are located in Kachin State in the far </p><p>north of Burma.  Dense jungles, high mountains (up to 19,000 </p><p>ft.), and poor roads make travel by land difficult. </p><p>Poisonous snakes, bandits, drug traffickers, thousands of </p><p>armed members of the Kachin Independence Army, and rugged </p><p>terrain make off-road travel in this area difficult. </p><p>Helicopter medevac capability would be important for any </p><p>sustained trek to a crash site by a recovery team.  Normally </p><p>both the scouting team, the IE, and the actual recovery team </p><p>(the Recovery Element, RE) would use helicopters extensively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE LACK OF HELICOPTERS:  The Burmese air force has a </p><p>fleet of Soviet-era helicopters and a small number of </p><p>helicopters given by the USG to the GOB two decades ago for </p><p>drug eradication purposes.  Given maintenance and repair </p><p>practices, the reliability of these aircraft is unknown. </p><p>Further, during the October technical talks the Burmese air </p><p>force\'s opening rental price was $16,000 per blade hour, </p><p>which they quickly dropped to $8,000/hr. after the loud, </p><p>unison guffaw from the U.S. side.  This is still two to three </p><p>times the going commercial rate.  Rather than be fleeced to </p><p>rent helicopters of uncertain reliability, the COM and DATT </p><p>strongly recommended that commercial helicopters be used to </p><p>augment GOB helicopters in the recovery efforts. </p><p>Unfortunately, it appears that the DoD-certified helicopter </p><p>lease companies in the region are booked up until mid to late </p><p>February.  This means the January IE will be restricted to </p><p>land transport. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) LIMITATIONS OF A LAND-BASED IE:  Locating and </p><p>excavating promising recovery sites is no mean feat. </p><p>Normally an IE would helicopter to a potential site </p><p>identified by a combination of aerial reconnaissance and </p><p>local human information.  If the site looked promising to the </p><p>IE after its helicopter-borne visit, a landing zone would be </p><p>cut and larger helicopters would ferry in the RE to work the </p><p>site.  If the January IE were restricted to Kachin State\'s </p><p>road network, a general impression of the topography of the </p><p>possible crash site would be about all an IE could glean in </p><p>the field.  The IE also will interview inhabitants who claim </p><p>to know of crash sites.  It seems likely that CILHI will need </p><p>to conduct further investigations in late February just prior </p><p>to the beginning of the recovery effort when commercial </p><p>helicopters are available.  This compressed and restricted </p><p>scouting phase will make it more difficult, but not </p><p>impossible, to achieve a major recovery success this year. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) POLITICS, SENSITIVITIES, AND PUBLIC DIPLOMACY:  Post </p><p>is keenly aware of the sensitivities of working (on any </p><p>issue) in Burma.  The remains recovery operation in Kachin </p><p>State is a particularly complex, sensitive, and difficult </p><p>case. </p><p> </p><p>--  The 1.2 million Kachin have a particular affinity for </p><p>Americans; over 10,000 fought alongside U.S. troops in WWII </p><p>and U.S. Baptist missionaries have converted many Kachin to </p><p>Christianity.  A long-running Kachin separatist movement, </p><p>spearheaded by the 20,000-strong Kachin Independence Army, </p><p>has signed a cease-fire with Rangoon\'s military government </p><p>but retains its weapons and controls much of Kachin State. </p><p>As one observer bluntly put it, "Kachins like Americans but </p><p>distrust (ethnic) Burmese."  The investigative and recovery </p><p>teams will likely pass back and forth between territory </p><p>controlled by Burmese soldiers and armed KIA members. </p><p>Interviewing Kachins who claim knowledge of crash sites in </p><p>front of ethnic Burmese members of Military Intelligence also </p><p>poses some challenges. </p><p> </p><p>-- While S1 General Khin Nyunt, who heads Burma\'s military </p><p>intelligence, is the point man for the GOB on the recovery </p><p>efforts, it will be the regional military commander in Kachin </p><p>State (who doesn\'t report to Khin Nyunt) who controls the </p><p>military resources on the ground.  Just as there appeared to </p><p>be a different approach on helicopter rental between MI and </p><p>the Burmese air force, we could possibly see independent </p><p>action in Kachin State not in keeping with the outline agreed </p><p>to with MI.  However, the DATT held coordination discussions </p><p>27 DEC 02 with military commander Maung Aye and S1 Khin Nyunt </p><p>to help head off any such difficulties. </p><p> </p><p>-- Post personnel are aware of standard procedures routinely </p><p>employed by MI in Burma.  For example, MI apparently </p><p>attempted to dragoon an English-speaking local to translate </p><p>for the December logistics visit.  A member of the DAO took </p><p>note, and asked that the man be released from his translating </p><p>duties, which he was.  This same officer saw MI brusquely </p><p>interrogating a Kachin interlocutor just after his discussion </p><p>with the American.  The officer approached his MI minders and </p><p>told them to stop harassing the man, which they did.  Post, </p><p>DPMO, and CILHI have discussed in detail with the GOB the </p><p>serious negative ramifications of any forced labor or forced </p><p>contributions being used to support this project.  The main </p><p>concern is that some local Burmese commander might not get </p><p>the word from on high. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  We are optimistic that the remains recovery </p><p>effort will be successful.  It is important that the Embassy </p><p>- State and DAO - play an active leading role in the </p><p>operation to help avoid potential local pitfalls.   Perhaps </p><p>the most promising sites (some of which are extremely remote) </p><p>can only be investigated and excavated next dry season, after </p><p>thorough analysis of local knowledge and a </p><p>helicopter-assisted IE.  Nevertheless, the recovery of even a </p><p>few remains this year is important, both in itself and to </p><p>establish procedures for an ongoing recovery effort.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
