<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 SANAA 001455 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, MARR, PREL, MNUC, MASS, KN, YM, MARITIME SECURITY </p><p>SUBJECT: U/S BOLTON\'S VISIT TO YEMEN: MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER,  MOD CHIEF OF STAFF, AND DEMINING AUTHORITY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charge Alan G. Misenheimer for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Begin summary:  During a day of official meetings on </p><p>June 17, Under Secretary for Non-Proliferation and </p><p>International Security John R. Bolton met with Foreign </p><p>Minister Abubaker al-Qirbi and MOD Chief of Staff Major </p><p>General Mohammed al-Qasami to discuss Yemen\'s relations with </p><p>the DPRK and to encourage the ROYG to sign an Article 98 </p><p>agreement (FM Qirbi Article 98 conversation reported septel). </p><p> Minister of State Qassim Ahmed al-Ajjam also briefed U/S </p><p>Bolton on Yemen\'s humanitarian demining program and the </p><p>impact of U.S. participation on its success.  During his </p><p>visit to Yemen, U/S Bolton also met with President Saleh and </p><p>his atomic energy advisor, Dr. Bahran -- see septels.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Foreign Minister Qirbi </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  U/S Bolton, accompanied by Charge, Special </p><p>Assistant Mark Groombridge, Jodie Green,OSD, and PolOff, </p><p>began his meeting with Foreign Minister Abubaker al-Qirbi by </p><p>discussing North Korea\'s nuclear program.  Bolton noted that </p><p>since last summer\'s confirmation of the DPRK,s </p><p>proliferation, the USG has worked hard to promote peaceful </p><p>nuclear disarmament.  Unfortunately, he added, the DPRK has </p><p>progressively escalated the conflict.  The USG will continue </p><p>to pursue a diplomatic solution, but, the flow of money which </p><p>is funding the DPRK,s nuclear program must be reduced, if </p><p>not stopped entirely.  To this end, the U.S. is forming a </p><p>partnership of people around the world to denounce the </p><p>DPRK,s unacceptable behavior.  Yemen\'s participation in this </p><p>partnership is very important because of ROYG SCUD missile </p><p>purchases from the DPRK, highlighted by last year\'s So San </p><p>incident.  Bolton said that it is time for Yemen and the U.S. </p><p>to place pressure on the DPRK and deny it the ability to </p><p>amass WMDs. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  Bolton expressed his belief that a way can be </p><p>found to deal peacefully with the DPRK.  Citing a recent </p><p>conference in Madrid, Bolton noted that the U.S. is prepared </p><p>to do more than just ask countries to cut off aid and stop </p><p>transactions.  During the meeting in Madrid, eleven </p><p>countries, all willing to bear the associated financial </p><p>burden, are preparing to conduct operations to intercept </p><p>suspect shipments from the DPRK.  However, it would be less </p><p>problematic if there were no purchases at all.  Because of </p><p>DPRK,s record of continued deception, the U.S. is concerned </p><p>about the sale of WMDs, including plutonium and uranium.  The </p><p>U.S. goal is to shut down DPRK sales of weapons and drugs, by </p><p>working with Yemen and others in the region. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Yemen and the DPRK - No Love Story </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NF)  Foreign Minister Qirbi said that ROYG has been </p><p>following the DPRK WMD problem and is ready to cooperate with </p><p>the U.S.  There is no love between ROYG and North Korea: the </p><p>relations are pragmatic, based on the low cost North Korea </p><p>offers on arms and construction.  Qirbi stressed that the </p><p>last shipment of SCUDS to Yemen was in December 2002, and </p><p>ROYG is not upgrading the SCUDS in its possession.  There is </p><p>an outstanding order for spare parts, totaling about $3-4 </p><p>million, and ongoing negotiations with DPRK for the </p><p>construction of naval base. (Qirbi quickly added that ROYG is </p><p>open to alternatives on the latter.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF)  Qirbi also said that ROYG has no interest in </p><p>providing the DPRK with any money for the development of </p><p>WMDs, particularly in light of the threat to Japan - a major </p><p>donor to Yemen.  Bolton noted that the U.S. has talked to </p><p>China and Russia on this issue.  The U.S. is in a race to </p><p>resolve the problem before the DPRK,s weapon status becomes </p><p>even more advanced. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF)  Qirbi responded by noting that ROYG still needs </p><p>to explore ways in to develop their coastal defense in the </p><p>absence of the DPRK.  While the problem of the Yemen-Saudi </p><p>border is being addressed by new security agreements with the </p><p>Saudis, Yemen has over 2,000 kilometers of coastline which is </p><p>difficult to control and must be secured.  Before </p><p>unification, Yemen had a limited naval capacity, and </p><p>currently has almost none.  The estimated cost for a new </p><p>naval base in Aden or Hodeidah was $80-100 million.  U/S </p><p>Bolton expressed an interest in pursuing this issue further. </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>MOD Chief of Staff Qasami and the DPRK </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF)  U/S Bolton was originally scheduled to meet with </p><p>Minister of Defense Abdullah Ali Aliwa, who was called away </p><p>on short notice in response to a border incident near Marib </p><p>(septel).  Chief of Staff Major General Qasami began by </p><p>apologizing for the Minister,s absence while noting ROYG,s </p><p>satisfaction with U.S.-Yemen cooperation in the war against </p><p>terror.  Training by U.S. forces has greatly improved </p><p>Yemen,s capabilities and with time, will advance them even </p><p>more. </p><p>8.  (S/NF)  U/S Bolton noted that, while the U.S. has no </p><p>intention of infringing upon Yemen,s legitimate defense </p><p>needs, it is important that the U.S. and Yemen work together </p><p>to cut off the flow of funding for the DPRK,s nuclear </p><p>program.  The U.S., he said, seeks a firm political agreement </p><p>that Yemen will have no additional procurement from the DPRK, </p><p>and will work with the U.S. to monitor and exchange </p><p>information on the DPRK and their sales in the Middle East. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S/NF)  Qasami noted that ROYG has discussed this issue </p><p>before, notably with Secretary Powell, and hopes the U.S. </p><p>understands Yemen\'s position.  The purchase of the SCUDS was </p><p>initiated in 1994 just before Yemen\'s civil war.  ROYG </p><p>subsequently asked for the money back, but, he said, the </p><p>request was ignored.  In the end ROYG decided to take the </p><p>SCUDS. Qasami emphasized that no more SCUDS will be purchased </p><p>and the ROYG will not upgrade those it already possesses. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Negotiations with DPRK for a Navy Base </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (S/NF)  Reviewing the same list of ongoing matters as FM </p><p>Qirbi, Qasami mentioned an agreement with the DPRK for </p><p>maintenance of missiles and coastal defenses and negotiations </p><p>on the possible construction of a naval base. U/S Bolton </p><p>noted that the U.S. would like to cut off these transactions </p><p>as well, and asked about alternative bidders -- perhaps from </p><p>Eastern Europe.  Qasami replied that ROYG looked at Eastern </p><p>European contractors but they were expensive and they all </p><p>wanted cash.  As for the contract for maintenance of coastal </p><p>defenses, that had been signed and partially paid, but the </p><p>amount -- about seven million dollars-- is not large.  The </p><p>ROYG will stop that contract, he offered, if the U.S. will </p><p>reimburse them. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  COS Qassimi again noted that ROYG will stop </p><p>negotiations with the DPRK for the naval base if the U.S. is </p><p>willing to assist.  He lamented the many problems facing ROYG </p><p>-- smuggling, Somali refugees, drug trafficking, and illegal </p><p>fishing -- as well as the lack of the facilities and </p><p>equipment necessary to deal with them.  What happened to the </p><p>Cole and the Limberg must not happen again, but the ROYG </p><p>needs U.S. assistance to prevent future terrorist attacks. </p><p>U/S Bolton replied that he did not question the ROYG,s </p><p>assessment of their needs; the U.S. is prepared to work with </p><p>Yemen and others interested in solving the North Korean </p><p>problem. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>The MOD View of Article 98 </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  Article 98:  Qasami noted that the Article 98 issue </p><p>was being worked between the MFA and the Ministry of Legal </p><p>Affairs.  If they ask the MOD for advice, he would support an </p><p>agreement.  Charge added that this should be an important </p><p>issue for MOD because if Yemen ratifies the ICC before </p><p>signing an Article 98 agreement, it will result in the loss </p><p>of military funding.  Qasami concluded by expressing his </p><p>appreciation for U.S cooperation on military assistance and </p><p>demining, noting that 95% of demining staff are recruits from </p><p>the MOD. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Demining: Successful Program with "A Long Way to Go" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>13.  (C)  Minister of State and Chairman of the National Mine </p><p>Action Committee (NMAC) Qassim Ahmed al-Aajam thanked U/S </p><p>Bolton for United States support to the ROYG\'s humanitarian </p><p>demining program.  American assistance was the "fundamental </p><p>basis" for demining\'s achievements over the past few years, </p><p>but continued USG engagement was crucial.  Mansour al-Azi, </p><p>the Executive Director of the NMAC, gave a presentation on </p><p>Yemen\'s humanitarian demining program overall and the impact </p><p>of U.S. contributions specifically.  After the presentation, </p><p>U/S Bolton spoke about the long-term needs of the demining </p><p>program, and  offered to check the status of current USG </p><p>funding for Yemen upon his return to Washington. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Development: The Key to Security in Yemen </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  Development was the main topic during U/S Bolton\'s </p><p>lunch with Ahmad Soufan, Deputy Prime Minister/Minister of </p><p>Development and International Cooperation, Foreign Minister </p><p>Qirbi and Charge.  Soufan and Qirbi both emphasized that </p><p>progress in development was the key to security and stability </p><p>in Yemen.  Development is the most important issue for the </p><p>people of Yemen, because they need hope for the future and </p><p>progress they can see in their daily lives.  Qirbi also </p><p>raised the Millennium Challenge Account, noting that Yemen is </p><p>on the list of eligible countries.  Both Ministers were </p><p>relaxed and cordial during the lunch, and thanked U/S Bolton </p><p>for coming to Yemen.  Soufan emphasized that U.S. visitors do </p><p>not come to Yemen frequently enough. </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
