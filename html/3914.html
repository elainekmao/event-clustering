(C) I want to extend a warm welcome to you on your </p><p>upcoming visit to Sri Lanka.  Your visit comes at an </p><p>exciting time, with many of the positive trends we </p><p>briefed you on during your January visit gaining </p><p>increased traction.  A ceasefire has been in place since </p><p>December 2001, and the government and the Tamil Tigers </p><p>just sat down for constructive face-to-face talks, which </p><p>are due to continue later this year.  The situation </p><p>remains fluid, however, with the intentions of the Tamil </p><p>Tigers still unclear.  The peace process could also be </p><p>undermined by domestic fissures, such as cohabitation </p><p>stresses between the PM and the President, and tensions </p><p>between the Muslim community and the LTTE.  The </p><p>government is also dealing with a delicate economic </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) This period of tremendous opportunity and </p><p>volatility in Sri Lanka is also a time of significant </p><p>U.S. influence.  Prime Minister Wickremesinghe wants to </p><p>work closely with the U.S.  Your visit will help cement </p><p>the gains made in U.S.-Sri Lankan relations by </p><p>underscoring our strong support for the peace process. </p><p>It will also help consolidate our human rights dialogue </p><p>with Sri Lanka.  Since the advent of the peace process, </p><p>the human rights situation continues to improve, as </p><p>conflict-related friction has steadily abated.  That </p><p>said, despite some progress, the GSL needs to do more </p><p>work to end the appearance of impunity from prosecution. </p><p>The Tiger\'s human rights record also continues to be </p><p>very poor, although the group recently released some </p><p>child soldiers.  While noting the significant progress </p><p>that has been made by the GSL, and how that progress has </p><p>reinforced the peace process, we suggest you underscore </p><p>our hope for additional forward movement.  This would be </p><p>in addition to your discussions focused on multilateral </p><p>human rights issues, per Sri Lanka\'s election to the </p><p>UNHRC earlier this year.  END EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Status of the Peace Process </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The election of a new government in </p><p>December 2001 heralded in an exciting -- and potentially </p><p>momentous -- period in Sri Lanka.  The United National </p><p>Front (UNF) government headed by Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremasinghe has taken an activist posture, </p><p>particularly regarding the peace process.  In short </p><p>order, the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) re-initiated the stalled Norwegian </p><p>government facilitation effort and put unilateral </p><p>ceasefires into effect in December 2001.  The government </p><p>also took rapid steps to ease tensions by lifting </p><p>roadblocks and checkpoints, and ending bans on medicine </p><p>and other items entering LTTE-controlled territories. </p><p>The government\'s performance on human rights issues has </p><p>also been a strong one, with many fewer Tamils </p><p>complaining of mistreatment at the hands of the security </p><p>forces.  (Note:  There is still an appearance of </p><p>impunity in some cases that the GSL needs to do more to </p><p>grapple with, however.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Continuing the positive trend, the GSL and the </p><p>LTTE went on to conclude a formal ceasefire accord in </p><p>February.  The accord is being monitored by the </p><p>Norwegian-run Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), which </p><p>has performed capably, but is thin on the ground.  In a </p><p>benchmark event, the two sides met face-to-face in </p><p>Thailand, September 16-18.  Before the talks took place, </p><p>the GSL met the long-standing demand of the LTTE and </p><p>lifted its ban on the organization, effectively </p><p>legalizing the LTTE as a political entity in Sri Lanka. </p><p>The talks -- though preliminary -- were constructive, </p><p>and set the stage for further talks slated to take place </p><p>later this year.  In a press conference held at the end </p><p>of the talks, the chief LTTE negotiator also made </p><p>remarks that seem to have edged away from an outright </p><p>demand for a separate state for Tamils.  In a very </p><p>recent development, the two sides also exchanged </p><p>prisoners for the first time since the war began. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) All of these steps have had a dramatic effect in </p><p>decreasing tensions in the country, bringing relief to a </p><p>war weary populace.  Already, the ongoing ceasefire is </p><p>the longest break that Sri Lankans have had from the </p><p>ethnic conflict since it began in 1983.  This new spirit </p><p>was symbolized by PM Wickremesinghe\'s visit to Jaffna in </p><p>March, the first such visit by a GSL leader in years. </p><p>SA Assistant Secretary Rocca joined Wickeremesinghe for </p><p>part of this visit, underscoring U.S. support for the </p><p>peace process.  A/S Rocca\'s visit also led to the </p><p>arrival of a demining team sponsored by the U.S., which </p><p>has been clearing mines in Jaffna since April.  The </p><p>Deputy Secretary also made a highly successful visit to </p><p>war-ravaged Jaffna during his August visit to Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>LTTE Intentions not clear </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Despite so much progress in so short a time, GSL </p><p>interlocutors will be the first to tell you that the </p><p>situation is fluid.  One key reason for this is lack of </p><p>confidence in the LTTE (which has been listed on our </p><p>Foreign Terrorist Organization list since 1997).  While </p><p>it is clear that the LTTE is worried about further </p><p>international isolation in the aftermath of September 11 </p><p>(there are indications that intensified international </p><p>pressure has decreased its funding, for example), it is </p><p>not clear whether the organization is simply looking for </p><p>a hiatus to wait out the storm.  Some of the LTTE\'s </p><p>activities raise questions about its commitment to </p><p>peace, including forced recruitment for its military </p><p>(some of it of children), the widespread extortion of </p><p>money from Tamils and Muslims, and a pattern of low- </p><p>level harassment of the Sri Lankan military.  The LTTE </p><p>also remains authoritarian in structure and has not </p><p>renounced terrorism (although there have been no </p><p>reported LTTE-sponsored terrorist attacks this year). </p><p>With full knowledge of these risks, the GSL has made the </p><p>decision that it wants to test the LTTE to determine </p><p>whether it is for real and, so far, this policy is </p><p>generating favorable results. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Cohabitation Stresses and Muslim issue </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Another factor that could unravel the peace </p><p>process is domestic opposition in the south.  The </p><p>radical, Sinhalese chauvinist Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP) party has engaged in rallies and demonstrations </p><p>against the ceasefire accord.  A potentially more </p><p>ominous threat is President Kumaratunga and her party, </p><p>who have sent mixed signals, at times constructive, at </p><p>times critical.  Kumaratunga\'s attitude seems largely </p><p>bound up in the cohabitation tensions that flare between </p><p>her and Prime Minister Wickremasinghe\'s government.  We </p><p>recently heard that the PM and the president plan to </p><p>meet regularly to discuss peace process and national </p><p>security issues, which is a positive development. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Muslim community and the LTTE also share a </p><p>tense relationship.  The two sides have long been at </p><p>loggerheads, particularly in the ethnically mixed </p><p>Eastern Province.  Based on first-hand observation by </p><p>Mission personnel and other reports, some Muslims are so </p><p>angered at efforts by the LTTE to marginalize their </p><p>community that the possible growth of Islamic extremism </p><p>needs to be closely monitored.   Taken together, all of </p><p>these tensions are not positive for the peace process, </p><p>especially during this sensitive period when the </p><p>negotiation track with the LTTE is just starting up. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Economic Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Turning briefly to economic issues, Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>situation is delicate.  While it has the most open </p><p>economy in South Asia and a relatively high per capita </p><p>income (USD 837), economic growth has been uneven and is </p><p>mostly confined to the greater Colombo region.  A litany </p><p>of problems in 2001 conspired to produce the country\'s </p><p>first year of GDP contraction since independence (minus </p><p>1.4 percent).  The new UNF government appears committed </p><p>to putting the right policies in place to re-ignite </p><p>economic growth.  The main test of this commitment came </p><p>in its 2002 budget, presented in March.  This budget </p><p>contained many substantive reform measures and was key </p><p>to restarting the suspended payments of the IMF\'s </p><p>Standby Arrangement.  The government is now implementing </p><p>many of these reforms, while trying to minimize the </p><p>burden of increased prices on the population.  We expect </p><p>2002 to be a rebuilding year, with growth of 2-3 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Our trade relationship with Sri Lanka entered </p><p>a new phase with the signing of a bilateral Trade and </p><p>Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in July.  The TIFA </p><p>sets up a council, jointly chaired by USTR and the Sri </p><p>Lankan Ministry of Commerce, to discuss trade and </p><p>investment issues.  The first council meeting is to take </p><p>place in November with the visit to Sri Lanka of Deputy </p><p>USTR Ambassador Huntsman.  The U.S. intends to use the </p><p>TIFA process to improve the investment climate in Sri </p><p>Lanka and win greater business here for American firms. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Human Rights:  A Record of Progress </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Regarding human rights issues, our assessment is </p><p>that this has been a year of clear progress.  Since the </p><p>advent of the peace process in December 2001, the human </p><p>rights situation continues to improve, as conflict- </p><p>related friction has steadily abated.  One tangible </p><p>example of this trend is that hundreds of Tamils -- </p><p>incarcerated under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) </p><p>-- have been released from jail.  (Note:  The issue of </p><p>the PTA is increasingly subject to political </p><p>negotiations between the GSL and the LTTE.  This </p><p>tentative discussion of PTA/POW/MIA issues shows signs </p><p>of veering toward an examination of whether the two </p><p>sides might consider a general amnesty for conflict- </p><p>related crimes or consider setting up a South Africa- </p><p>style "truth and reconciliation" commission as part of a </p><p>final settlement.  The discussion of these potentially </p><p>combustible issues is at its very, very early stages, </p><p>but we wanted to flag it for you.  End Note.)  On a day- </p><p>to-day level, with the removal of many roadblocks and </p><p>checkpoints, Tamils as a whole are also less subject to </p><p>petty harassment than in the past.  Progress has also </p><p>been made in a number of long-term cases.  Indictments, </p><p>for example, have been handed down in the "election day" </p><p>incident involving the killing of ten Muslims on </p><p>December 5, 2001.  One of those indicted was a former </p><p>deputy minister who is a close relative of President </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s.  Indictments were also handed down in the </p><p>"Bandarawela" incident in which over 20 Tamils were </p><p>killed in ethnic-based attacks in October 2000 in </p><p>central Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Despite this solid track record, human rights </p><p>observers agree that the GSL can make more progress in </p><p>ending the appearance of impunity from prosecution for </p><p>those acting in the name of the GSL.  Another emerging </p><p>issue, which has been a long-standing problem (if </p><p>somewhat obscured by the prior near-total focus on </p><p>conflict-related violations), has been police brutality </p><p>during interrogation of criminal suspects.  The human </p><p>rights situation in LTTE areas also remains very poor, </p><p>although the group has recently released some child </p><p>soldiers. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) This exciting period in Sri Lanka provides many </p><p>opportunities for the U.S.  Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremesinghe wants to work closely with the U.S.  Per </p><p>the recent policy review, various USG agencies are in </p><p>the process of visiting Sri Lanka to review economic and </p><p>commercial issues, and study the possible return of the </p><p>Peace Corps, in addition to visits focused on enhanced </p><p>defense cooperation.  Your visit will also help </p><p>consolidate the human rights dialogue with Sri Lanka, </p><p>which you commenced in January.  While noting the </p><p>significant progress that has been made by the GSL, and </p><p>how that progress has reinforced the peace process, we </p><p>suggest you underscore our hope for additional forward </p><p>movement. You could also solicit ideas on ways to </p><p>improve the human rights situation in LTTE-controlled </p><p>areas.  This would be in addition to your discussions </p><p>focused on multilateral human rights issues, per Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s election to the UNHRC earlier this year. </p><p>(Note:  Mission plans to issue a brief press statement </p><p>announcing your visit, but we are not planning any press </p><p>events for you.  If you encounter any press during the </p><p>trip, however, we recommend that you speak freely about </p><p>the purpose of the visit.) </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) We suggest that you make the following key </p><p>points in your meetings with Sri Lankan officials: </p><p> </p><p>-- Express strong U.S. support for the peace process and </p><p>Norwegian facilitation. </p><p> </p><p>-- GSL needs to keep up momentum;  Sri Lanka is a vital </p><p>symbol of movement toward peace and stability in a </p><p>troubled South Asian region. </p><p> </p><p>-- All parties should work in national interest on peace </p><p>process and on economic reform.  It is important that </p><p>peace process not falter because of political </p><p>infighting. </p><p> </p><p>-- Human rights issues important; GSL has shown </p><p>significant improvement.  Progress in this area is </p><p>helping reinforce peace process. </p><p> </p><p>-- Despite some progress in this area, more needs to be </p><p>done to end appearance of impunity from prosecution for </p><p>those acting in the name of the GSL. </p><p> </p><p>-- Another emerging issue has been police brutality </p><p>during interrogation of criminal suspects. </p><p> </p><p>-- Need to find ways to improve human rights situation </p><p>in LTTE-controlled areas. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
