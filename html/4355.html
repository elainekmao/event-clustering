<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 006706 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/I, NEA AND PRM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/17/2020 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, KPAL, KWBG, IS, JO, KPRP </p><p>SUBJECT: PALESTINIAN REFUGEES AND THE RIGHT OF RETURN:  THE </p><p>VIEW FROM JORDAN (C-NE2-01206) </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 209364 </p><p> </p><p>     B. AMMAN 5912 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 1805 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Following more than two years of Israeli-Palestinian </p><p>violence and Israel\'s intense and still ongoing military </p><p>operations in the West Bank and Gaza, few if any Palestinian </p><p>refugees in Jordan are focused on the right of return.  In </p><p>the eyes of Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Israeli </p><p>government policies and the evisceration of the Palestinian </p><p>Authority have made any discussion of final settlement </p><p>irrelevant for the moment.  Moreover, with new Israeli </p><p>elections and the possibility of war in Iraq looming, most </p><p>Palestinian refugees in Jordan are deeply worried that the </p><p>Israeli Government will seize the opportunity to move large </p><p>numbers of Palestinians from the West Bank (ref b).  Although </p><p>the GOJ continues to plan its position for final status </p><p>talks, questions of compensation and right of return are not </p><p>the most important issues on Palestinian refugees\' minds </p><p>these days.  Nevertheless, we offer the following in response </p><p>to ref a request for information. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  The vast majority of the 1.7 million registered </p><p>Palestinian refugees resident in Jordan enjoy citizenship and </p><p>(nearly) full rights.  We believe that a sizeable majority -- </p><p>especially those Palestinian-Jordanians who are economically </p><p>well-established -- would not/not seek to exercise their </p><p>right of return in the event of a political settlement.  An </p><p>estimated 100,000 Gazans, concentrated in Jerash and Aqaba, </p><p>do not hold Jordanian citizenship.  These, as well as less </p><p>economically advantaged refugees who still live in the camps, </p><p>would be more inclined to accept an offer of return to a new </p><p>Palestinian state. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  The public GOJ position and public statements made </p><p>by refugees themselves insist on the right of return, and </p><p>these public positions are unlikely to change.  However, </p><p>private discussions with GOJ officials and refugees alike </p><p>reveal a general acceptance of the notion that most </p><p>Palestinian refugees in Jordan would not exercise that </p><p>theoretical right.  While most refugees would like the right </p><p>to travel to historical Palestine (including ancestral homes </p><p>inside Green Line Israel), most privately acknowledge that </p><p>their lives and livelihoods are irreplaceably rooted in </p><p>Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  For Palestinian refugees resident in Jordan, the </p><p>most contentious issue in final status talks likely would be </p><p>the question of who would receive financial compensation for </p><p>relinquishing the right of return.  Palestinian refugees in </p><p>Jordan, according to several prominent Palestinian </p><p>politicians we have spoken to over the past two years, will </p><p>expect direct cash payments for their personal relinquishment </p><p>of the right of return.  A "flash" payment of the sort </p><p>envisioned in the Taba talks likely would prove acceptable to </p><p>Palestinian refugees resident in Jordan; any settlement that </p><p>would not include a direct payment would provoke serious </p><p>discontent. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  The GOJ, still plugging away at research in </p><p>anticipation of a settlement, will also seek compensation for </p><p>its own substantial expenditures for "hosting" Palestinian </p><p>refugees since 1948.  Then-GOJ peace process coordinator </p><p>Marouf Bakhit (now the Jordanian Ambassador in Ankara) told </p><p>PolCouns in September that the GOJ continues to work on </p><p>"credible" numbers for use in negotiations on compensation, </p><p>calculating the number of refugees and displaced persons at </p><p>1.46 million.  The GOJ reports that it has already expended </p><p>nearly USD 4 billion on health care and education for </p><p>Palestinian refugees and would seek matching compensation. </p><p>Bakhit said the GOJ would use a significant portion of any </p><p>compensation to rehabilitate refugee camps in Jordan, since </p><p>they generally fall below the standards of other Jordanian </p><p>urban areas for services, and symbolize the "outsider" status </p><p>of Palestinian refugees. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  The rejectionist groups resident in Jordan have been </p><p>surprisingly quiet on all political questions following the </p><p>GOJ\'s stern April 2002 warning against any activities that </p><p>could threaten internal stability (ref c).  GOJ Department of </p><p>Palestinian Affairs Director Abdulkarim Abulhaija has </p><p>repeatedly told RefCoord that rejectionist groups understand </p><p>that GOJ security services will react "quickly and cruelly if </p><p>necessary" to maintain order, and they are keeping a low </p><p>profile.  As a result, there have been few and only minor </p><p>protests or other organized political activities in the </p><p>refugee camps in the last six months.  Although we are not </p><p>privy to internal discussions of rejectionist groups, we </p><p>suspect that they -- like the Palestinian refugee population </p><p>at large -- are focused more on current Israeli government </p><p>policies and perceived strategic threat to the Palestinian </p><p>people and far less on the question of final status </p><p>negotiating positions. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
