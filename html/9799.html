(S)  PolCouns July 28 covered with Samer Dabbas, Iraq </p><p>action officer in FonMin Muasher\'s Private Office, ref points </p><p>requesting that the GOJ tighten its border controls with </p><p>Iraq.  Dabbas said that he believed considerable GOJ </p><p>resources had already been devoted to border control with </p><p>Iraq, but that many of them might be concentrated around the </p><p>Karama-Trebil crossing point.  He asked that the U.S. provide </p><p>Jordan with specific USG concerns about smuggling and illegal </p><p>transit across the Jordan-Iraq border so the GOJ can </p><p>understand the problem the U.S. sees and move to counter it </p><p>effectively. </p><p> </p><p>3.

(S)  COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST:  USG cooperation with </p><p>the GOJ on border security is very close.  We would </p><p>appreciate any details available of the smuggling and illegal </p><p>transit activity that the USG believes is occurring through </p><p>Jordan so we can pinpoint for the GOJ how it can counter such </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>5.
