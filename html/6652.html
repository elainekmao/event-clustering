(C)  Finance Minister Marto told us privately that plans </p><p>were in the works to raise domestic gasoline and fuel oil </p><p>prices.  The increase was included in the 2003 budget and an </p><p>initial gasoline price increase of 25 fils/liter (13 </p><p>cents/gallon) was to have gone into effect on Friday, March </p><p>21.  However, Marto said that King Abdullah decided the </p><p>moment was not right politically.

(U)  King Abdullah delivered an address on national TV at </p><p>approximately 2000 local time March 21.  The King stressed </p><p>the importance of "placing our national interest above all </p><p>interests and considerations," and the primacy of maintaining </p><p>Jordan\'s security and stability.  He stated that </p><p>demonstrations in support of "the brotherly Iraqi people" </p><p>should be "expressed in a civilized manner," and that such </p><p>"expressions should reflect the true belonging to beloved </p><p>Jordan."  The King ended his address by urging Jordanians to </p><p>go to work and carry on with daily life, and with assurance </p><p>that the GOJ was taking measures to ensure the continuity of </p><p>normal daily life in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>5.

(C)  Embassy contacts reported at 2030 local time March 21 </p><p>that demonstrations were continuing in the southern Jordanian </p><p>city of Ma\'an.  According to these sources, one PSD officer </p><p>was injured in the demonstrations.  Media reports of March 22 </p><p>indicated "spur of the moment" demonstrations were held March </p><p>21 in various locations throughout the country, with some </p><p>reportedly calling for "Arab armies" to come to the aid of </p><p>Iraq and Saddam.  A Media report indicated that protesters </p><p>demanded the expulsion of US troops and the US Ambassador at </p><p>an unlicensed March 21 afternoon demonstration in downtown </p><p>Amman. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.
