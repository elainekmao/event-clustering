Mr. Uzor Daniel, father of Ms. Isioma </p><p>Daniel, the journalist whose controversial article sparked </p><p>the recent riots in Nigeria, came to the Consulate General </p><p>in Lagos on December 2 seeking help for his daughter to </p><p>gain refugees status and subsequent entry into the U.S. </p><p>He confirms that Ms. Daniel remains in hiding in Benin </p><p>Republic.  He fears his daughter is not safe in Africa, and </p><p>requests that we not share this information with Nigerian </p><p>authorities for fear that his daughter\'s safety will be </p><p>compromised.  Amnesty International subsequently contacted </p><p>Poloff to discuss the case following Mr. Daniel\'s visit; he </p><p>says he is in touch with a Conoff in her present location. </p><p>Simon Gbenga Kolawole, the editor of This Day and his </p><p>family, face a similar threat.  We believe that Ms. Daniel </p><p>confronts a well-founded fear of persecution.  We recommend </p><p>that the Department explore means to provide assistance. </p><p>We lack sufficient information to address whether any other </p><p>person associated with this episode, including members of </p><p>the Daniel and Kolawole families, face well-founded fear of </p><p>persecution.   End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Background.  Many people in Nigeria blame Ms. </p><p>Daniel\'s article "The World at their Feet," published in </p><p>ThisDay Newspaper on November 15, for sparking rioting </p><p>which reportedly killed 150-250 persons and injured or </p><p>displaced hundreds more in Kaduna and Abuja beginning </p><p>November 20 and lasting for several days. The article, </p><p>considered blasphemous by the Muslim community, has </p><p>attracted international criticism from as far as India and </p><p>Kenya.  Deputy Governor Mamuda Shinkafi of Zamfara State </p><p>and other individuals have pronounced a "fatwah" sentence </p><p>of death against Ms. Daniel.  The Federal Government has </p><p>called the fatwah a nullity.  Other religious and political </p><p>leaders questioned the legitimacy of the purported fatwah. </p><p>On November 28, Dr. Lateef Adegbite, Secretary General of </p><p>the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), </p><p>declared Zamfara State\'s fatwah sentence against Ms. Daniel </p><p>illegitimate and stated that it "should not be followed." </p><p>Reports quoted Adegbite as welcoming Ms. Daniel to return </p><p>to Nigeria and expressed his "surprise that she fled the </p><p>country."  Other Islamic religious leaders have also </p><p>criticized the fatwah, stating it has no force or effect; </p><p>many have urged Muslims to accept ThisDay\'s statements of </p><p>apology and remorse.  However, the Zamfara Deputy Governor </p><p>has not retracted his fatwah, and Governor Ahmed Sani, on </p><p>Umrah, apparently has not spoken out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) On December 2, Mr. Uzor Daniel, CEO of SoundHaus </p><p>International, LTD. approached the Consulate General in </p><p>Lagos, claiming he was the father of Ms. Daniel.  He </p><p>delivered a letter addressed to the Consul General under </p><p>the heading "re: Application for Political Asylum for Miss </p><p>Isioma Daniel (Journalist)." Text follows. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Quote.  My name is UZOR DANIEL and I am the father </p><p>of Miss Isioma Daniel, 21, the journalist with THIS DAY </p><p>newspaper who wrote the controversial Miss World article </p><p>that resulted in the Kaduna/Abuja riots.  In the heat of </p><p>the crisis I spirited her across the border to brothers in </p><p>the Republic of Benin for safety.  Following the death </p><p>sentence passed on her by the Zamfara State </p><p>Islamic Government, we contacted Amnesty International, </p><p>London, and through the help of their Mr. Enrique Restoy </p><p>(+447986858272) she has applied to the USA embassy in </p><p>Cotonou for political asylum in USA.  However, since she is </p><p>not normally resident in that country, we wish to approach </p><p>your embassy to kindly assist in every way possible to get </p><p>her out of reach any harm as quickly as possible.  If it </p><p>were possible for her to be with the embassy there, while </p><p>her application is being processed, that would be </p><p>appreciated.  She can be reached on 009-229 95 21 59 in the </p><p>meantime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Quote continued.  Secondly, for the rest of us in </p><p>the family, myself and two teenage children, (my wife is </p><p>currently visiting the US), I also wish to request that in </p><p>case there is any extension of hostilities to us as result </p><p>of this controversy, we shall be asking for your protection </p><p>as well.  So far we have not had any cause to fear for </p><p>ourselves, even though our identity is being very closely </p><p>guarded.  My contact phone is 08023161437.  I will like to </p><p>know who to call in case of emergency.  Thank you and God </p><p>bless.  Yours sincerely, [signed] Uzor Daniel.  End quote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Mr. Daniels explained to Conoffs that he told his </p><p>daughter to return to his home after violence broke out </p><p>against the ThisDay newspaper office on November 20.  He </p><p>said the State Security Service (SSS) was unable to find </p><p>and question her before Mr. Daniel spirited her into hiding </p><p>out of concerns for her safety.  Mr. Daniel said his </p><p>daughter was schooled in the UK, but her student visa had </p><p>expired.  Her Nigerian passport had also expired, he said, </p><p>and had not been renewed.  He said he took her across the </p><p>Nigerian-Benin border without authorization from the </p><p>authorities of either country.  Because he fears that </p><p>Nigerian authorities might publicly disclose the location </p><p>of his daughter, he does not want to approach the Nigerian </p><p>authorities to request a passport renewal or to discuss her </p><p>case.  He placed her in the home of a trusted friend </p><p>in Benin for safe-keeping while he tried to seek asylum on </p><p>her behalf through Amnesty International.  Amnesty is in </p><p>touch with her there, he said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Poloff inquired whether anyone had asked his </p><p>daughter to make the statement which was construed as </p><p>blasphemous in order to provoke a violent societal </p><p>reaction.  Mr. Daniel insisted that the statement was of </p><p>her own creation and had not been intended to offend </p><p>anyone.  He indicated that the article was an isolated </p><p>mistake on the part of a very young adult in a new </p><p>profession. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Later on December 2, the Information Resource </p><p>Officer at the Consulate\'s Public Affairs Section received </p><p>a request for visa assistance for the editor of ThisDay, </p><p>Simon Gbenga Kolawole, his wife, Abimbola Sherifat </p><p>Kolawole, and their six month old daughter, Fiyinfoluwa </p><p>Naomi Kolawole.  The "head of travels" of ThisDay, who </p><p>passed the Kolawole family\'s request on to the Consulate, </p><p>said the family is under the same threat as Ms. Daniel.  We </p><p>do not know if the family is in hiding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Comment.  Despite public assurances by various </p><p>leaders that the fatwah is improper, subsequent reports </p><p>call into question the Government\'s ability to contain </p><p>public sentiment against the reporter and prevent violence </p><p>against her person.  On November 29, one 57 year old civil </p><p>servant from Zamfara stated to the press, "If she comes to </p><p>northern Nigeria, I\'ll do my duty as a Muslim.  I\'ll kill </p><p>her."  Another Zamfara trader remarked, "That woman must </p><p>die, I\'m ready to take care of it myself."  Extremists in </p><p>some parts of Nigeria may therefore choose to honor the </p><p>previously issued fatwah calling for Ms. Daniel\'s death. </p><p>Regarding the Zamfara Deputy Governor\'s purported fatwah, </p><p>Hardline Islamic leader Shehu Maishanu said, "He simply </p><p>said what is in the Koran, that is that someone who insults </p><p>the Prophet must die.  It\'s the duty of all Muslims to kill </p><p>her.  It\'s too late for excuses.  The only way she can </p><p>escape her punishment is to convert [to Islam]." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Comment continued: Because of the statements of </p><p>Zamfara Deputy Governor Shinkafi and of some Islamic hard- </p><p>liners, we believe that Ms. Daniel has a reasonable and </p><p>well-founded fear of persecution.  The threat of violence </p><p>against her here remains real.  We believe the USG should </p><p>support her application for refugee status.  While no </p><p>"fatwah" has been pronounced against Mr. Kolawole, it would </p><p>be difficult to contend that he, as the editor responsible </p><p>for the offensive edition, would not have a well-founded </p><p>fear of persecution should he assert it.  We therefore </p><p>would support refugee status for Mr. Kolawole, as well, </p><p>should he seek it.  We lack the information necessary to </p><p>determine whether other persons, including Uzor Daniel, </p><p>face a well-founded fear of persecution.  We are not aware </p><p>of any threats against them, but we will further explore </p><p>this question and report if such threats exist. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
