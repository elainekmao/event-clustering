<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000752 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DRL and EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>USDA/FAS for ICD and G&F </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, SNAR, EAGR, VM, ETMIN </p><p>SUBJECT:  Turning Highlanders into Rice Farmers </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  Summary:  Many efforts to improve the living </p><p>standards of highland ethnic minorities center on </p><p>transforming their way of life from slash-and-burn </p><p>agriculture to sedentary farming, particularly production of </p><p>rice and, increasingly, cash crops.  This agricultural </p><p>transformation complements GVN attempts to integrate </p><p>minorities into the country\'s economic and political fabric, </p><p>provide better services in remote areas, and eliminate opium </p><p>production.  Turning highland minorities such as the Hmong </p><p>and the Dao in Lao Cai and Yen Bai provinces into irrigated </p><p>rice farmers more closely resembling the majority Kinh is </p><p>likely overall well-meaning as well as yet another way to </p><p>cement the "national great unity bloc."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Provincial Overview </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  According to Lao Cai provincial director of Ethnic </p><p>Minority Affairs Lu Huy Chi, about 70 percent of this </p><p>northwestern province\'s 600,000 residents are members of one </p><p>of 17 different ethnic minorities.  Provincial </p><p>implementation of central government programs for minorities </p><p>and remote communities has been crucial in cutting the </p><p>poverty rate from around 26 percent in 2000 to the current </p><p>19 percent, Chi claimed.  He and his colleagues indicated </p><p>that almost the entire budget for these programs comes from </p><p>the central government. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Yen Bai Province\'s head of Ethnic Minority Affairs, </p><p>Duong Van Vanh, separately confirmed to poloffs that </p><p>minorities make up slightly over half of the province\'s </p><p>710,000 residents.  Tay and Thai people comprise about half </p><p>the minorities and tend to live in the lowlands with the </p><p>majority Kinh people.  Dao and Hmong account for most of the </p><p>upland minorities; others include Muong, Nung, and Cao Lan. </p><p>Except for the Hmong concentrated in the western portion of </p><p>the province, minorities are scattered throughout the </p><p>province.  Per capita annual income is about three million </p><p>VND (less than $200) and half that in remote areas.  Almost </p><p>15 percent of households suffer from periodic hunger, with </p><p>the percentage twice as high in remote areas.  About 90 </p><p>percent of funds for development in the province come </p><p>directly from the central government, Vanh added. </p><p> </p><p>Agricultural Transformation </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The Hmong, Dao, and some other ethnic minority </p><p>groups traditionally practiced slash-and-burn agriculture, </p><p>according to authorities in both provinces.  With </p><p>significant GVN assistance, authorities claimed, members of </p><p>these minority groups had begun to cease these practices and </p><p>to become proficient at creating rice terraces and growing </p><p>irrigated rice.  Various GVN provisions -- such as the </p><p>centrally-funded Program 135 for mountainous and ethnic </p><p>minority areas -- provide subsidies and material support for </p><p>building materials as well as some agricultural inputs such </p><p>as improved seeds, fertilizer, and insecticides.  Other </p><p>infrastructure projects have built irrigation systems, </p><p>access roads, and markets.  Provincial branches of the </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development have </p><p>reportedly targeted increased agricultural extension </p><p>services to help swidden farmers learn sedentary </p><p>agriculture. </p><p> </p><p>Community-Level Implementation in Lao Cai </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Lao Cai Province\'s Sapa District, now one of </p><p>Vietnam\'s main tourist destinations, traditionally produced </p><p>opium.  Major efforts over the past decade have reduced this </p><p>cultivation to almost nothing, according to district </p><p>officials.   The challenge has been to finding suitable cash </p><p>crops to replace opium; new cash crops brought in only a </p><p>part of the lost income from opium.  Officials indicated </p><p>that government subsidies and temporary employment on </p><p>infrastructure project construction have contributed much of </p><p>the rest of the lost income. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Sapa District People\'s Committee Chairman Hoang Kim </p><p>Thai and other Sapa officials explained further that </p><p>"community-based" development efforts to spread the benefits </p><p>of tourism more evenly throughout the district and to </p><p>improve rural incomes had given local people a fuller sense </p><p>of participation in development efforts.  They described </p><p>local people as very concerned about income generation; in </p><p>lieu of opium, they increasingly recognized tourism as a </p><p>relatively easy source of income. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  Tourism promotion has also gone hand-in-hand with </p><p>efforts to discourage slash-and-burn farming, which leaves </p><p>the land scarred and is less and less sustainable with </p><p>larger populations.  Instead, authorities are touting </p><p>irrigated rice cultivation on terraces, supplemented by </p><p>fruit trees, soybeans, and other crops.  Officials were </p><p>quick to point out "new" rice terraces and fruit tree groves </p><p>on mountain slopes outside Sapa.  Commune-level officials </p><p>claimed efforts to stop swidden practices had already made a </p><p>lot of headway compared to four or five years before, when </p><p>people used to "burn freely."  Even so, many fires were </p><p>still burning on the slopes on Sapa Valley during poloffs\' </p><p>February visit, and there were recent signs of slash-and- </p><p>burn practices in Lao Cai\'s Bao Thang and Bao Yen districts </p><p>as well.  Some small fires burning near Sapa had also spread </p><p>into reforestation zones. </p><p> </p><p>Infrastructure and Services </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Irrigation systems are critical to make rice </p><p>farming really worthwhile in these mountainous areas, </p><p>according to officials; without irrigation, only one rice </p><p>crop can be grown per year.  Corn and soybeans are the </p><p>favored dry season crops, but do not yield as much income or </p><p>food as irrigated rice.  As yet, irrigation systems cover </p><p>relatively little upland area; in Yen Bai Province\'s Viet </p><p>Cuong commune, only 170 of 714 hectares of agricultural </p><p>land, for example, or a little more than 100 hectares of </p><p>over 5,000 total hectares in Lao Cai Province\'s So Pa </p><p>commune.  Rugged terrain and scarce funding have limited the </p><p>average size of irrigation projects to about 20 hectares in </p><p>Viet Cuong and roughly half that in So Pa.  Furthermore, </p><p>Program 135 -- the source of much infrastructure funding in </p><p>upland areas -- finances only small-scale irrigation </p><p>projects. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  Officials in both provinces told poloffs that </p><p>agriculture extension efforts centered primarily on </p><p>irrigated rice and fruit trees.  Agricultural extension </p><p>workers concentrated on introducing new varieties of rice </p><p>and teaching farmers how to use the fertilizers and </p><p>insecticides supplied by the GVN free or below cost, they </p><p>noted.  Many Hmong were not experts at rice culture crops, </p><p>authorities in both provinces said, but were learning </p><p>quickly.  Lao Cai district-level officials mentioned that </p><p>marketable flower production remained under consideration, </p><p>but more improvements in the road system would be needed to </p><p>make this more feasible.  Some reforestation and forest </p><p>protection efforts are also underway, more noticeably in Yen </p><p>Bai than in Lao Cai. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  Lao Cai and Yen Bai officials reviewed other </p><p>benefits ethnic minority farmers may receive in addition to </p><p>free or subsidized agricultural inputs.  According to </p><p>authorities, all of the farmers in So Pa and Viet Cuong </p><p>communes have already received long-term (usually 25-30 </p><p>years) land use certificates for the land they currently </p><p>cultivate.  All of So Pa\'s residents were free from land-use </p><p>taxes, and only a handful of Viet Cuong\'s populace paid land- </p><p>use taxes, according to their respective commune heads. </p><p>Residents of poor and remote communes may also receive low </p><p>interest credit to buy equipment under Program 135.  Yen Bai </p><p>Province\'s Vanh further claimed that all residents in the </p><p>province\'s 70 poorest communes now receive free medical </p><p>treatment.  He added that the GVN even subsidized the price </p><p>of salt and cooking oil so that they cost no more in rural </p><p>areas than in town markets. </p><p> </p><p>Resettlement </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  Promoting sedentary agriculture has gone in </p><p>parallel with efforts to move people from widely scattered </p><p>homes into villages, again following the ethnic Kinh norm in </p><p>Vietnam.  Authorities stressed that such concentrations make </p><p>provision of education, health care, electricity, access to </p><p>markets, electricity, and other services much easier.  They </p><p>denied forced resettlement, instead stressing the use of the </p><p>major incentive of land use certificates.  However, the </p><p>scarcity of level ground complicated the construction of </p><p>large settlements, Yen Bai\'s Vanh admitted, with most level </p><p>ground already in use for rice paddies. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Critics of the GVN are quick to assume sinister </p><p>motives from many GVN programs related to ethnic minorities, </p><p>especially anything that disrupts traditional practices or </p><p>"infringes" upon the "sovereignty" of mountainous areas </p><p>where ethnic minorities had lived with little central </p><p>government oversight for hundreds of years.  After meeting </p><p>with these provincial and district officials, we are more </p><p>inclined to credit officials with largely good faith efforts </p><p>to improve local living standards for these poorest of the </p><p>poor, who happen to be ethnic minorities.   At the same </p><p>time, these expanded roles and presence by officials are </p><p>part and parcel of larger GVN and CPV efforts to ensure </p><p>solid control throughout the country, thereby, they hope, </p><p>diminishing the possibility of what officials claim are </p><p>"plots" by "hostile forces" aimed at sabotaging "national </p><p>solidarity." </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
