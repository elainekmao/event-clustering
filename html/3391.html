<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 001465 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, SOCI, PTER, PREL, NP, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL\'S NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION FLOUNDERS </p><p>AS MEMBER EJECTED FOR ETHICAL PROBLEMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Summary:  A founding member of Nepal\'s National Human </p><p>Rights Commission (NHRC) was suspended from the body on July </p><p>24 for "behavior unbecoming the glory of the post."  The </p><p>incident underlines serious flaws in the NHRC:  members\' </p><p>strong political affiliations have led to a polarization of </p><p>the body, a lack of impartiality, and infighting.  Perceived </p><p>Maoist sympathies have created a distrust of the NHRC in the </p><p>government, fueling non-cooperation and underfunding. </p><p>Because of conflicts between members, lack of support from </p><p>the government, and competing pressures from the human rights </p><p>community, the NHRC has been largely unsuccessful in its </p><p>efforts to alleviate human rights problems in Nepal.  To be a </p><p>more effective body, the Commission requires increased </p><p>funding, changes in the appointment process, and a renewed </p><p>commitment by its members to the principles of impartiality </p><p>and transparency.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Founding Member Booted Off </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The July 24 suspension of National Human Rights </p><p>Commission (NHRC) member Kapil Shrestha has brought to light </p><p>the weaknesses and internal conflicts that plague Nepal\'s </p><p>NHRC.  According to press reports, both an NGO activist and a </p><p>former NHRC employee had charged Shrestha with ethical lapses </p><p>which included "misbehaving" with a Dalit woman.  (Note: </p><p>Dalits are a low-caste group widely discriminated against in </p><p>Nepal.  End Note.)  Rumors of this indiscretion, which </p><p>reportedly took place while Shrestha and the woman were </p><p>abroad at an international conference, had been circulating </p><p>in the capital for some time.  Shrestha has denied the </p><p>allegations.  The other NHRC members decided amongst </p><p>themselves to suspend Shrestha and refer his case to the </p><p>Speaker of the House of Representatives for action on his </p><p>continued tenure.  (Note:  Ordinarily, the House\'s Human </p><p>Rights Committee would take up the case, but Nepal\'s </p><p>Parliament has been dissolved pending new elections later </p><p>this year.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Only Two Years Old, Human Rights Body Riven By Conflict </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  The Commission has been steeped in controversy since </p><p>its beginnings.  Mandated by an Act of Parliament in 1997, it </p><p>was not established until June 5, 2000 following a massive </p><p>campaign by the human rights community.  Commission members </p><p>are appointed by the King on the advice of a Recommendation </p><p>Committee made up of the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of </p><p>the Supreme Court, and the leader of the opposition party in </p><p>the House of Representatives.  Though appointed by political </p><p>parties, the appointees are supposed to maintain neutrality. </p><p>The NHRC carries out its mandate through the conduct of </p><p>inquiries and investigations and by undertaking research and </p><p>education initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  The NHRC\'s founding membership consists of Chairman </p><p>Nayan Khetri, an elderly man described by members as unable </p><p>to make strong decisions; Indira Rana, a moderate with links </p><p>to the Nepali Congress Party and a good track record for </p><p>transparency; Sushil Pyakurel, a opposition-party-affiliated </p><p>radical with a long history of far-left activism; and Gouri </p><p>Shankar Lal Das, a pre-democracy era public health official </p><p>who has remained almost invisible in NHRC activities.  Kapil </p><p>Shrestha, the suspended founding member, is a self-proclaimed </p><p>"independent" who has been increasingly at odds with other </p><p>members. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Politicization and Infighting </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  According to the members themselves, the NHRC is </p><p>seriously flawed on account of its members\' polarized </p><p>political leanings.  This polarization has led to partiality, </p><p>infighting, and low productivity.   Founding member Indira </p><p>Rana views that NHRC members are divided along party lines </p><p>and are therefore reluctant to investigate allegations made </p><p>against members of their own parties.  The Commission\'s </p><p>impartiality and credibility have been impaired as a result. </p><p>Members admitted to us that they had difficulty being </p><p>impartial in large part because they obtained their positions </p><p>at the recommendation of political party representatives. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Rana added that political differences have led to </p><p>infighting between Commission members and staff.  Conflict is </p><p>a constant issue in the NHRC, and it was arguments over work </p><p>that led to the accusations that forced Kapil Shrestha\'s </p><p>suspension.  Infighting and the questionable behavior of some </p><p>members has hurt the NHRC\'s reputation at a time when trust </p><p>and support is vital to its survival, Rana stated.  Rana also </p><p>feels marginalized and overruled by the increasing </p><p>assertiveness of members Sushil Pyakurel and, before his </p><p>suspension, Kapil Shrestha. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  In an interview not long before his suspension, Kapil </p><p>Shrestha acknowledged the deep animosity between Commission </p><p>members.  After his suspension, he declared the action taken </p><p>against him "a consipracy."  Shrestha also admitted to us </p><p>that the NHRC tends to take a sympathetic attitude towards </p><p>the Maoists, particularly in the last six months.  This, he </p><p>said, was due to the dominance of left-leaning members. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  Prakash A. Raj, a well-respected professional writer </p><p>who worked for the NHRC on its annual human rights report, </p><p>quit for this very reason.  He says that the five team </p><p>members assigned under him were appointed by Sushil Pyakurel, </p><p>a Communist Party-affiliated member.  Raj believes that one </p><p>team member was secretly a Maoist.  Raj quit because his team </p><p>refused to emphasize Maoist human rights violations in the </p><p>report and was trying to move the content away from the </p><p>insurgency entirely.  He says that the Commission\'s political </p><p>leanings prevent it from taking a balanced view of human </p><p>rights conditions. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Government Mistrust </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  Initially reluctant to establish the Commission, the </p><p>government has provided only minimal funding since its </p><p>establishment.  Even so, last year,s allocation was the </p><p>largest so far at Rs. 5.6 million.  According to Kapil </p><p>Shrestha, the NHRC has to cope with a "largely </p><p>non-cooperative response by government workers."  He ascribes </p><p>an adversarial relationship between the NHRC and the rest of </p><p>the government to the fact that Commission members have been </p><p>unable to shed their party affiliations, which draws its </p><p>credibility into question.  He also notes that the Chairman, </p><p>Nayan Khatri, a pre-democracy era politician, has no </p><p>relationship with political leaders, and so those leaders </p><p>have no confidence in the NHRC.  Moreover, some members say </p><p>that apparent Maoist sympathies have created mistrust of the </p><p>Commission in the government, which feels overly criticized </p><p>by the body.  They add that the Commission\'s lack of </p><p>objectivity has resulted in widespread doubts about its </p><p>credibility.  A number of high-ranking military and police </p><p>officials have told us of their belief that Sushil Pyakurel </p><p>and his brother, a human rights activist, are covert Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Relationship With NGOs Strained </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  Inadequate government funding has forced the NHRC to </p><p>seek the help of a variety of NGOs, further compromising its </p><p>impartiality, says Kapil Shrestha.  According to him, because </p><p>of the influence that comes along with NGO funding, </p><p>information, and research, "impartiality on a number of </p><p>occasions has been compromised."  In general, the NHRC has a </p><p>very close relationship with Nepali NGOs, and relies on them </p><p>for the bulk of its information regarding human rights abuses. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  The human rights community as a whole has </p><p>unrealistically high expectations for the NHRC and expects it </p><p>to take over much of their own duties, according to the </p><p>British Embassy\'s Human Rights Officer.  Indira Rana agrees </p><p>that some NGOs are "not holding up their end" by providing </p><p>consistent and accurate reporting, and they expect the NHRC </p><p>to make up the difference.  Krishna Pahadi of the Human </p><p>Rights and Peace Society (HURPES) expressed the view that </p><p>certain members of the Commission were not responsive to NGOs </p><p>and would "cover-up" issues.  He reports that HURPES will </p><p>help strengthen the Commission only when the issue of its </p><p>credibility and competence have been resolved. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Limited Accomplishments, "Judicial Teeth" </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C)  The NHRC has repeatedly failed to submit reports on </p><p>time or at all, to account for the money they have received, </p><p>and to get any response to or respect for their inquiries, </p><p>insiders say.  Says one, "I don,t want to say that we,ve </p><p>totally failed, but the Commission,s capacity is extremely </p><p>limited, and our activities have become largely symbolic or </p><p>confined to Kathmandu."  British Emboff also feels that the </p><p>NHRC suffers from a lack of "judicial teeth," and so without </p><p>the cooperation of other government departments their work </p><p>does not mean much.  Despite its many shortcomings, the NHRC </p><p>has managed to produce an annual Human Rights Report, </p><p>organize several discussion seminars, and meet with </p><p>government officials to urge them to respect human rights </p><p>during the current state of emergency. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Strengthening the Commission </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)  Because it is a government body, the Commission has </p><p>tremendous potential as a driving force for human rights in </p><p>Nepal, NGOs believe.  They add that its serious flaws must be </p><p>addressed for that potential to be realized.  To that end, </p><p>NHRC member Indira Rana suggests changing the appointment </p><p>process of members to allow for open competition, and </p><p>eliminating the minimum age of 40 years. She also would like </p><p>to see another woman on the Commission so that more attention </p><p>is given to women\'s issues, which are a vital human rights </p><p>concern in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  Several members also mentioned the need for more </p><p>funding to reduce the NHRC,s reliance on NGO support and to </p><p>hire competent staff members.  The NHRC has been long </p><p>suffering from staff shortages because of both a lack of </p><p>funds and a shortage of government-provided staff.  Increased </p><p>funding could also be used to improve the Commission\'s </p><p>dilapidated, run-down offices.  The British, Norweigian, and </p><p>Danish Embassies have all provided funding for investigation </p><p>purposes.  The British say that supporting the NHRC is not </p><p>very expensive, and only "limited funding is needed." </p><p> </p><p>15. (C)  Commission members also suggested that the </p><p>international community put pressure on the government to </p><p>respond to the inquiries of the NHRC in a truthful and timely </p><p>manner and to make a pledge of general support.  All agree, </p><p>however, that the most important step to strengthening the </p><p>Commission is for the members to work out their political </p><p>differences, examine their practices to ensure transparency, </p><p>and work to enforce impartiality at all levels. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) The NHRC\'s flaws are cause for serious concern.  Its </p><p>public reputation is already poor, and the suspension of </p><p>Kapil Shrestha, rather than raising confidence in the NHRC by </p><p>its stand against inappropriate behavior, seems only to have </p><p>brought the infighting out into the open.  Unless its </p><p>credibility improves, it will be difficult for the Commission </p><p>to gain a higher level of government support and cooperation, </p><p>and realize its role as both a human rights watchdog and a </p><p>check against government abuses.  We have encouraged the </p><p>Nepali government to follow the stipulations of the Human </p><p>Rights Commission Act of 1997 and cooperate fully with NHRC </p><p>investigations.  We have also maintained a close working </p><p>relationship with the NHRC and urged it to take a more </p><p>balanced and professional approach to its mission. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
