<p>UNCLAS DAMASCUS 003036 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  ASAD:  ISRAEL DOES NOT DESIRE PEACE </p><p> </p><p>REF(S):  FBIS EUP2001070700109 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: ACCORDING TO A LENGTHY INTERVIEW WITH </p><p>GERMAN NEWS MAGAZINE DER SPIEGEL 7/9, SYRIAN PRESIDENT AL- </p><p>ASAD ACCUSED ISRAELI PM SHARON OF PUSHING THE REGION </p><p>TOWARDS WAR; ASSERTED THAT SYRIA WANTED PEACE BUT WOULD NOT </p><p>SHY AWAY FROM WAR IF FORCED INTO IT; AND WAS UNAPOLOGETIC </p><p>ABOUT SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR HIZBALLAH.  ASAD, WHO DEPARTS 7/10 </p><p>FOR A STATE VISIT TO BERLIN, ALSO OFFERED A TORTURED </p><p>DEFENSE OF HIS CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS REGARDING JEWS DURING </p><p>THE POPE\'S VISIT TO DAMASCUS LAST MAY.  THE INTERVIEW IS </p><p>PART OF THE SARG\'S EFFORT TO BURNISH ASAD\'S CREDENTIALS </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY AND PAVE THE WAY FOR HIS TRIP TO GERMANY. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) HIGHLIGHTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- PM SHARON: "IT\'S OBVIOUS THAT SHARON AND HIS GOVERNMENT </p><p>ARE SEEKING A WAR.  THEY WISH TO PLUNGE THE WHOLE REGION </p><p>INTO CONFLICT." </p><p> </p><p>-- HIZBALLAH:  "POLITICALLY AND MORALLY, WE TOTALLY SUPPORT </p><p>HIZBALLAH AND ITS JUST CAUSE OF REGAINING THOSE TERRITORIES </p><p>IN LEBANON WHICH ARE STILL UNDER OCCUPATION...SYRIA DOES </p><p>NOT CONTROL THE ACTIONS OF HIZBALLAH" </p><p> </p><p>-- CONFLICT WITH ISRAEL:  "SO LONG AS WE REMAIN COMMITTED </p><p>TO THE PEACE STRATEGY, WE WILL NOT LET OURSELVES BE DRAWN </p><p>INTO WAR.  BUT NEITHER WILL WE SHY AWAY FROM IT, SHOULD WAR </p><p>BE FORCED UPON US.  MOREOVER, THERE IS A WHOLE RANGE OF </p><p>THINGS THAT WILL HIT ISRAEL HARDER THAN WAR.  WE HAVE ONE </p><p>OR TWO IN OUR LOCKER." </p><p> </p><p>-- INTIFADA:  "ARAFAT HAS NEVER BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>INTIFADA....THE INTIFADA IS NOT THE WORK OF ONE MAN, ONE </p><p>STATE, OR ONE PARTY, IT IS THE REVOLT OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>-- PROSPECTS FOR PEACE WITH ISRAEL: ASAD DENIED THAT SYRIA </p><p>SUPPORTED A NEW "CALL TO DRIVE THE ISRAELIS INTO THE SEA." </p><p>"THIS IS NOT OUR REASONING...WE ACCEPT THE REASONING OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND SAY, AS YOU DO IN GERMANY [AND] </p><p>IN THE U.S. THAT ISRAEL MUST HAND BACK THE TERRITORIES IT </p><p>OCCUPIED IN 1967.  THE [HARSHER] TONE WE\'RE ADOPTING IS IN </p><p>LINE WITH THE CHANGING CONDITIONS [I.E., CURRENT TENSION IN </p><p>THE REGION].  IN TERMS OF POLICY, WE STICK BY OUR </p><p>PRINCIPLES [I.E., NEGOTIATIONS BASED ON MADRID TERMS OF </p><p>REFERENCE]. </p><p> </p><p>-- ANTISEMITIC REMARKS:  "WE SYRIANS OPPOSE THE TERM ANTI- </p><p>SEMITISM...SEMITES ARE A RACE...WE ARE AT ITS CORE...I </p><p>MERELY COMPARED CHRIST\'S AGONIES WITH THE SUFFERINGS OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS."  ASKED IF HE HAD MEANT THAT JEWS WERE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR CHRIST\'S AGONIES, ASAD REPLIED THAT "THESE </p><p>ARE HISTORICAL FACTS WHICH WE CANNOT DENY.  BUT HOW CAN </p><p>ANYONE ATTRIBUTE AN ANTI-JEWISH ATTITUDE TO ME, WHEN WE </p><p>ALSO HAVE JEWISH CITIZENS HERE IN SYRIA, AND WE AS MUSLIMS </p><p>RECOGNIZE THE JEWISH RELIGION?" </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ECONOMY:  "SYRIA IS STILL A SOCIALIST COUNTRY, BUT </p><p>WE DO OF COURSE HAVE A VISION FOR THE FUTURE...WE ARE </p><p>BUILDING DEVELOPMENT POLICY ON TWO PILLARS: CREATING MORE </p><p>JOBS, AND RAISING STANDARDS OF LIVING.  WE WILL CONSIDER </p><p>ANYTHING THAT HELPS TO ACHIEVE THIS.  BUT WE WILL NOT SELL </p><p>THE STATE SECTOR." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) COMMENT:  ASAD\'S PERSONAL ATTACKS AGAINST SHARON AND </p><p>HIS THREATS TO RESPOND TO FURTHER ISRAELI STRIKES ARE </p><p>HARSHER AND MORE EXPLICIT THAN HIS RECENT PUBLIC REMARKS ON </p><p>THESE ISSUES.  THIS PROBABLY REFLECTS THE INCREASING </p><p>PRESSURE HE FEELS, FROM BOTH DOMESTIC CONSTITUENCIES AND </p><p>OTHER ARAB LEADERS, TO RESPOND MORE DIRECTLY IF ATTACKED </p><p>AGAIN.  HE IS LIKELY FRUSTRATED THAT THE ANTI-SEMITISM </p><p>ISSUE HASN\'T GONE AWAY AND CONCERNED THAT PROTESTS COULD </p><p>MAR WHAT HE HOPES WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL TRIP TO BERLIN THIS </p><p>WEEK.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>PEARCE </p><p></p></div>
