If the </p><p>US were to deploy 60,000 troops in Northern Iraq, according </p><p>to the report, Turkey will deploy even a larger number of </p><p>troops to show its intention to prevent the establishment of </p><p>a Kurdish State there.  Turkey is reportedly against the </p><p>deployment of British troops in Northern Iraq under any </p><p>circumstances.  "Cumhuriyet" reports that discussions </p><p>between the US and Turkey about the use of Turkish resources </p><p>in a possible war are continuing.  Within this framework, a </p><p>US military-technical delegation will be coming to Turkey </p><p>this week to examine the airports in Diyarbakir, Mus, </p><p>Batman, and Malatya.  "Yeni Safak" reports that during the </p><p>Iraqi opposition meeting in London, opposition leaders </p><p>agreed that they are against the presence of a foreign </p><p>military power in Iraq after the fall of Saddam. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: "Radikal" reports that TRNC president Denktas is </p><p>seeking new ways to prevent a settlement in Cyprus.  Denktas </p><p>met with TRNC officials in Ankara yesterday to discuss a new </p><p>strategy to counteract pressure for a settlement.  The paper </p><p>adds that the EU decision to open the accession doors to the </p><p>Greek Cypriots has created tension in the TRNC.  Opposition </p><p>parties in the TRNC have asked Denktas to step down and </p><p>transfer his responsibilities as negotiator to someone else. </p><p>"Sabah" reports that there are rumors in Cyprus that Denktas </p><p>will resign.  "Hurriyet" reports that Turkey has started </p><p>work to achieve a settlement in Cyprus by February 28. </p><p>Turkish officials have already informed the UN about their </p><p>intention to support talks for settlement, and they will be </p><p>meeting with TRNC president Denktas today. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF: "Hurriyet" reports that a visiting IMF delegation will </p><p>hold contacts in Turkey until the end of this week.  The IMF </p><p>has been bothered by some aspects of the government\'s Urgent </p><p>Action Plan, a proposed package on tax amnesty, high </p><p>hazelnut support prices, and the public tender law.  The IMF </p><p>delegation will return to Turkey in January. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Cyprus </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Time for a solution" </p><p> Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (12/17): </p><p>"Following the Copenhagen summit, it is inevitable that </p><p>negotiations on Cyprus will begin based on the Annan plan. </p><p>A settlement within the next 2.5 months will make both sides </p><p>of Cyprus a member of the EU. . There are two opposing views </p><p>in both Turkey and in Northern Cyprus.  One view calls for a </p><p>settlement before the EU deadline, while the other advocates </p><p>a process of integration with Turkey.  . The AKP government </p><p>seems to favor a settlement to the issue.  This is certainly </p><p>the best option for both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots. </p><p>It is indeed the time for a settlement on the island.  It is </p><p>time to look ahead with a broad horizon, and to leave </p><p>skepticism and old mentalities behind us." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The Cyprus test for AKP" </p><p>Cengiz Candar wrote in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(12/17): "The Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas should be given </p><p>a last chance for a settlement.  He should feel obliged to </p><p>declare that he considers the Annan plan as a basis for an </p><p>agreement, not only a basis for negotiations.  If he is </p><p>reluctant to do that, and if the AKP really wants to be in </p><p>charge, Turkey should withdraw its support for Denktas, and </p><p>the Turkish Cypriots should go to either an election or a </p><p>referendum. . Cyprus is very much Turkey\'s business, thus </p><p>Ankara does not have the luxury of saying to Denktas: `do </p><p>whatever you think is right.\'  The Cyprus policy should be </p><p>formulated in Ankara, and implemented accordingly." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
