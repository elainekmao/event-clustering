(U) FOREIGN MINISTER STANISLAUS MUDENGE, IN AN </p><p>ADDRESS TO PARLIAMENT ON APRIL 4, THREATENED THAT THE </p><p>GOZ COULD DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY IF INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SANCTIONS WERE IMPOSED ON ZIMBABWE, ACCORDING TO BOTH OF </p><p>HARARE\'S DAILY NEWSPAPERS ON APRIL 6.  MUDENGE </p><p>REPORTEDLY STATED THAT "IN MOST CASES, DUE TO THE </p><p>DEMANDS FOR NATIONAL SURVIVAL, COUNTRIES UNDER SANCTIONS </p><p>USUALLY RESORT TO DECLARING STATES OF EMERGENCY.  I DO </p><p>NOT SAY ZIMBABWE WILL NECESSARILY FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE BY </p><p>DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY, BUT ONE CANNOT RULE IT </p><p>OUT."  THE FOREIGN MINISTER WENT ON TO SAY THAT RULE BY </p><p>DECREE "NEITHER PROMOTES DEMOCRACY NOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE, THE PURPORTED OBJECTIVES OF THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY BILL BEFORE THE USA </p><p>SENATE." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT: IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT SPARKED THIS </p><p>OUTBURST BY THE FOREIGN MINISTER, WHO RARELY SPEAKS IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  HIS REMARKS, HOWEVER, REFLECT FRUSTRATION </p><p>AT ZIMBABWE\'S GROWING ISOLATION AND AT THE MOVES BY SOME </p><p>-- INCLUDING THE U.S. CONGRESS, THE COMMONWEALTH, AND </p><p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT -- TO TURN UP THE HEAT ON THE </p><p>MUGABE REGIME.  MUDENGE, ONE OF THE REGIME\'S MORE HARD- </p><p>LINE FIGURES, IS KNOWN FOR MAKING BLUSTERY STATEMENTS </p><p>THAT REFLECT THE GOVERNMENT\'S GROWING DESPERATION.  WE </p><p>SUSPECT WE WILL HEAR A LOT MORE NOISE IN THIS CONNECTION </p><p>AND ALREADY HAVE SEEN SOME HAM-HANDED ATTEMPTS BY </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO ABRIDGE CONSTITUTIONALLY-GUARANTEED </p><p>FREEDOMS.  WE ALSO HAVE HEARD THIS SORT OF TALK BEFORE. </p><p>THE DIFFERENCE THIS TIME IS THAT MUDENGE WENT STRAIGHT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01259  060935Z </p><p>TO A PUBLIC FORUM TO LEVEL HIS THREAT.
