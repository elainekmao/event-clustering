(C) ON MARCH 24, THE RIJEKA COUNTY COURT FOUND FORMER </p><p>CROATIAN ARMY GENERAL MIRKO NORAC AND TWO CO-CONSPIRATORS </p><p>GUILTY OF INDIVIDUAL AND COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MURDER </p><p>OF OVER 50 ETHNIC SERBS AND CROAT CIVILIANS IN THE TOWN OF </p><p>GOSPIC IN 1991.  THE LANDMARK VERDICT, WHICH THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT WILL HEAR ON DEFENSE APPEAL, MARKS THE FIRST TIME THAT </p><p>SENIOR CROATIAN MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN CONVICTED IN A </p><p>CROATIAN COURT FOR WAR CRIMES.  CROATIA\'S RIGHT WING -- </p><p>INCLUDING HDZ PRESIDENT SANADER -- CONDEMNED THE DECISION; </p><p>PRIME MINISTER RACAN AND VIRTUALLY THE REST OF THE GOC </p><p>COALITION OFFERED NO COMMENT.  THE ICTY, WHICH CONTINUES TO </p><p>HAVE INTEREST IN NORAC FOR HIS ROLE IN WAR CRIMES COMMITTED </p><p>DURING THE 1993 MEDAK POCKET OPERATION, TELLS US IT WELCOMES </p><p>THE RULING. </p><p> </p><p>2.

END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A LANDMARK RULING </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON MARCH 24, RIJEKA COUNTY COURT JUDGE IKA SARIC, </p><p>SENTENCED FORMER CROATIAN GENERAL MIRKO NORAC, LOCAL CIVILIAN </p><p>LEADER TIHOMIR ORESKOVIC, AND FORMER CROATIAN ARMY COLONEL </p><p>STJEPAN GRANDIC TO 12, 15 AND 10 YEARS OF PRISON, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY, FOR THEIR ROLES IN ORGANIZING AND MURDERING AT </p><p>LEAST 42 ETHNIC SERB AND ETHNIC CROATS IN THE TOWN OF GOSPIC </p><p>IN 1991.  THE CASE MARKS THE FIRST TIME SENIOR CROATIAN </p><p>MILITARY OFFICIALS WERE CONVICTED OF WAR CRIMES IN A LOCAL </p><p>PROSECUTION.  A FOURTH INDICTEE, IVICA ROZIC, WAS ACQUITTED </p><p>DUE TO LACK OF EVIDENCE, WHILE THE PROSECUTION DROPPED </p><p>CHARGES AGAINST A FIFTH INDICTEE, MILAN CANIC, IN MID-MARCH. </p><p>(IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING HIS ACQUITTAL, THE GOSPIC PROSECUTOR\'S </p><p>OFFICE INDICTED ROZIC FOR PLANTING 13 EXPLOSIVE DEVICES IN </p><p>THE HOMES OF ETHNIC SERB RETURNEES FROM 1996 TO 1998, KILLING </p><p>SIX.  CROATIAN DIRECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE RANKO OSTOJIC TOLD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00680  01 OF 04  260700Z </p><p>US THAT THE POLICE BELIEVE ROZIC ALSO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>AUGUST 2000 MURDER OF ICTY WITNESS MILAN LEVAR, ALTHOUGH THEY </p><p>HAVE INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE HIM.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAID THEY WOULD APPEAL THE CASE TO </p><p>THE SUPREME COURT, ARGUING THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT </p><p>EVIDENCE TO CONVICT THE SUSPECTS.  THE SUPREME COURT HAS THE </p><p>RIGHT TO ANNUL THE VERDICT OR TO REDUCE (OR INCREASE) THE </p><p>SENTENCE.  DORIS HRAST, LEAD PROSECUTOR IN THE CASE, TOLD US </p><p>THAT THE PROSECUTION WOULD APPEAL THE ROZIC ACQUITTAL AND </p><p>ARGUE THAT THE SUPREME COURT UPHOLD THE SENTENCES AGAINST THE </p><p>OTHER THREE FELONS.  THERE IS NO INDICATION AS TO WHEN THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT MIGHT ISSUE ITS VERDICT -- PROSECUTION APPEALS </p><p>IN OTHER WAR CRIMES CASES HAVE BEEN PENDING FOR OVER FIFTEEN </p><p>MONTHS.  COUNTING THE TWO-PLUS YEARS NORAC SERVED IN </p><p>DETENTION AWAITING AND DURING TRIAL, HE WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR </p><p>PAROLE IN FIVE YEARS (AFTER HALF THE SENTENCE IS SERVED). </p><p> </p><p>IF ALL CROATIAN JUDGES WERE LIKE SARIC... </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.

SHE EMPHASIZED </p><p>THAT THERE WAS NO JUSTIFICATION WHATSOEVER FOR THEIR </p><p>"LIQUIDATION."   APOLOGIZING TO THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS, </p><p>SARIC SAID THAT SHE HOPED THE SENTENCE WOULD BRING THEM SOME </p><p>COMFORT.  SHE RECOMMENDED TO THE PROSECUTION THAT OTHERS WHO </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN PLANNING AND EXECUTING THE CRIMES BE TRIED AS </p><p>WELL.  (ACCORDING TO VARIOUS WITNESSES, UP TO 15 PERSONS </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING THAT ORESKOVIC AND NORAC CHAIRED </p><p>IN WHICH ETHNIC SERB AND ETHNIC CROAT NON-COMBATANTS IN THE </p><p>GOSPIC AREA WERE MARKED FOR EXECUTION.)  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>SARIC SAID THAT MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES -- NORAC\'S YOUTH AND </p><p>INEXPERIENCE, HIS RECORD OF "VALOR" IN DEFENSE OF GOSPIC, AND </p><p>PRIOR SERB WAR CRIMES AGAINST ETHNIC CROATS -- COMPELLED HER </p><p>NOT TO EXTEND THE MAXIMUM PUNISHMENT OF TWENTY YEARS AGAINST </p><p>THE THREE CONVICTED DEFENDANTS.  (WHILE A MODEST SENTENCE BY </p><p>U.S. STANDARDS, THE GOSPIC VERDICT WAS IN LINE WITH STANDARDS </p><p>BOTH LOCALLY AND ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE.) </p><p> </p><p>CROATIAN POLITICIANS, ICTY REACT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) POLITICIANS OF ALL STRIPES IGNORED JUDGE SARIC\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00680  02 OF 04  260700Z </p><p>MESSAGE THAT CROATIANS NEED TO BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR WAR </p><p>CRIMES THEY COMMITTED.  CALLING NORAC A "GREAT CONTRIBUTOR TO </p><p>THE DEFENSE OF THE HOMELAND," HDZ PRESIDENT IVO SANADERS SAID </p><p>THAT HE RECEIVED THE VERDICT WITH GREAT "SORROW."  HE SAID HE </p><p>WAS "HOPEFUL" THAT "TRUTH AND JUSTICE" WOULD PREVAIL IN THE </p><p>SUPREME COURT.  SANADER CRITICIZED THE GOC FOR FOMENTING A </p><p>CLIMATE THAT "CRIMINALIZES BOTH WAR VETERANS AND CROATIA\'S </p><p>INDEPENDENCE WAR."  (COMMENT:  BY PLAYING TO THE NATIONALIST </p><p>RIGHT YET AGAIN, SANADER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE </p><p>THAT HE IS SINCERE IN HIS ATTEMPTS TO MODERNIZE AND TRANSFORM </p><p>THE HDZ.  WE HAVE LET THE HDZ KNOW OF OUR DISAPPOINTMENT AND </p><p>OUR RESOLVE NOT TO GIVE SANADER THE VALIDATION HE SEEKS FROM </p><p>US UNLESS HIS PUBLIC RHETORIC MATCHES HIS PRIVATE ASSURANCES </p><p>OF REFORM.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) PRIME MINISTER RACAN AND OTHER LEADING COALITION </p><p>FIGURES REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE JUDGMENT, BUT CALLED ON </p><p>CROATIANS TO RESPECT THE JUDICIAL PROCESS AND NOT TAKE TO THE </p><p>STREETS IN PROTEST.  HE SAID THAT THE PROCESS "CONFIRMED THAT </p><p>CROATIA IS A STATE IN WHICH RULE OF LAW PREVAILS."  ONLY IVO </p><p>BANAC, PRESIDENT OF THE TINY COALITION LIBERAL PARTY (LS), </p><p>HAD THE COURAGE TO STATE THAT CRIMES WERE COMMITTED IN GOSPIC </p><p>AND THAT THE RIJEKA COURT\'S RULING DEMONSTRATES THE </p><p>SERIOUSNESS OF THOSE CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) ICTY ZAGREB HEAD OF OFFICE THOMAS OSORIO TOLD US THAT </p><p>ICTY PRIVATELY WELCOMED THE RULING, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD REFRAIN </p><p>FROM PUBLIC COMMENT, AT THE VERY LEAST UNTIL IT HAS A CHANCE </p><p>TO READ AND REVIEW SARIC\'S WRITTEN VERDICT.  (THE WRITTEN </p><p>VERDICT IS NOT EXPECTED FOR AT LEAST A MONTH).  DESPITE THE </p><p>GOSPIC CASE RULING, ICTY STILL MAY INDICT NORAC FOR HIS ROLE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00680  02 OF 04  260700Z </p><p>IN WAR CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE CROATIAN MILITARY DURING THE </p><p>1993 "MEDAK POCKET" OPERATION, OSORIO SAID.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>CROATIAN PROSECUTOR HRAST, THERE IS NO LEGAL OBSTACLE TO </p><p>NORAC SERVING HIS CROATIAN SENTENCE WHILE AWAITING TRIAL IN </p><p>THE HAGUE. </p><p> </p><p>IMPLICATION FOR LOCAL PROSECUTIONS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) RACAN AND OTHER GOC OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT THE GOSPIC </p><p>CASE DEMONSTRATES THAT CROATIAN COURTS ARE CAPABLE OF </p><p>DELIVERING JUSTICE IN HIGHLY SENSITIVE WAR CRIMES CASES. </p><p>HOWEVER, NOT TO DETRACT AT ALL FOR THE REAL COURAGE OF JUDGE </p><p>SARIC AND OTHER INVOLVED IN BRINGING A HIGHLY COMPLEX AND </p><p>SENSITIVE CASE TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION, GOSPIC REMAINS THE </p><p>EXCEPTION, NOT THE RULE IN CROATIAN JURISPRUDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) AS REPORTED REFTELS, OTHER WAR CRIMES CASES AGAINST </p><p>ETHNIC CROATS -- SUCH AS THE NOTORIOUS LORA CASE -- HAVE </p><p>ENDED IN FIASCO.  CHIEF PROSECUTOR MLADEN BAJIC RECENTLY </p><p>COMPLAINED TO US THAT LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS INCREASINGLY ARE </p><p>OBSTRUCTING NEW WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST ETHNIC </p><p>CROATS.  BAJIC ADDED THAT HE FINDS IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT </p><p>TO CONTROL HIS LOCAL PROSECUTORS IN WAR-AFFECTED AREAS SUCH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1808 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00680  03 OF 04  260701Z </p><p>ACTION SWCI-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      USNW-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EUR-00   VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------4AD0DA  260701Z /38 </p><p>P 260700Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 9818 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF JUSTICE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 ZAGREB 000680 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/WCI, EUR/SCE, INL/AAE, EUR/ACE, AND DRL </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OPDAT AND ICITAP </p><p>SARAJEVO FOR KONTOS AND TILMAN </p><p>BELGRADE FOR BROWN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00680  03 OF 04  260701Z </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE/WHEATON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ICTY, KAWC, KJUS, PREL, UNSC, HR </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA WAR CRIMES: GOSPIC CASE ENDS IN CONVICTION </p><p> </p><p>AS OSIJEK, GOSPIC AND SISAK. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) THE GOSPIC TRIAL WAS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF A UNIQUE </p><p>CONFLUENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES: </p><p> </p><p>-- IKA SARIC PROVED TO BE THE RIGHT JUDGE FOR THE CASE. </p><p>STRONG WILLED AND PROFESSIONAL, SHE WAS ABLE TO WITHSTAND </p><p>UNRELENTING RIGHT-WING PRESSURE AND THREATS.  LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS IN RIJEKA TELL US THAT AT LEAST ONE OTHER WAR </p><p>CRIMES CASE THERE HAS STAGNATED BECAUSE INVESTIGATORS FEAR </p><p>RIGHT-WING RETRIBUTION AGAINST THEIR FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- PROSECUTORS IN RIJEKA WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP SUFFICIENT </p><p>PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO CORROBORATE AND TO COMPEL CONVINCING </p><p>EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY.  THIS COMBINATION OF REINFORCING </p><p>MATERIAL AND WITNESS TESTIMONY HAS BEEN LACKING IN OTHER </p><p>CASES, MOST NOTABLY THE LORA WAR CRIMES TRIAL IN SPLIT. </p><p>-- THE PROSECUTION SKILLFULLY USED THE TESTIMONY OF SUSPECT </p><p>STJEPAN GRANDIC AGAINST NORAC AND ORESKOVIC. </p><p> </p><p>-- IN ADDITION TO ETHNIC SERBS, NORAC AND HIS CO-CONSPIRATORS </p><p>ALSO MURDERED ETHNIC CROATS WHOM THEY BELIEVED WERE NOT </p><p>SUFFICIENTLY "RELIABLE."  ACCORDING TO HRAST, THE MURDER OF </p><p>CROATS HELPED INDUCE A NUMBER OF KEY WITNESSES TO STEP </p><p>FORWARD AND TESTIFY, DESPITE INTENSE INTIMIDATION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00680  03 OF 04  260701Z </p><p> </p><p>-- UNLIKE SOME OTHER WAR CRIMES CASES, THE DOCUMENT TRAIL IN </p><p>THE GOSPIC CASE WAS EXTENSIVE, TO INCLUDE RECORDED BRIEFINGS </p><p>TO BOTH PRESIDENT TUDJMAN AND DEFENSE MINISTER SUSAK.  THIS </p><p>DOCUMENT TRAIL MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE DEFENDANTS TO </p><p>COVER THEIR TRACKS AND FOR WITNESSES TO DEVELOP "AMNESIA." </p><p> </p><p>-- EARLY IN THE TRIAL PROCESS, THE CASE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM </p><p>GOSPIC TO RIJEKA, WHERE THE TRIAL COULD BE HELD IN A </p><p>RELATIVELY BENIGN ENVIRONMENT.  HRAST WAS CONVINCED THAT HAD </p><p>THE TRIAL BEEN CONDUCTED IN GOSPIC -- CROATIA\'S "TWIN PEAKS" </p><p>EQUIVALENT -- THE PRESSURE ON THE JUDGES AND WITNESSES WOULD </p><p>HAVE BEEN SO INTENSE AS TO PRECLUDE ANY CHANCE OF CONVICTION. </p><p> HOWEVER, THE GOC -- FOR DOMESTIC POLITICAL REASONS -- HAS </p><p>BEEN RELUCTANT TO TRANSFER OTHER WAR CRIMES CASES TO "SAFER" </p><p>COURTS.  ALL OTHER WAR CRIMES PROSECUTIONS AGAINST ETHNIC </p><p>CROATS IN CROATIA HAVE BEEN HELD IN THEIR ORIGINAL </p><p>JURISDICTIONS.  ALL HAVE ENDED WITH VERY QUESTIONABLE </p><p>RESULTS. </p><p> </p><p>LESSONS LEARNED </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) THE BOTTOM LINE, ACCORDING TO HRAST AND, SEPARATELY, </p><p>CHIEF PROSECUTOR MLADEN BAJIC, IS THAT -- BARRING SIGNIFICANT </p><p>LEGISLATIVE REFORM AND INCREASED POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THOSE </p><p>PRESSING FORWARD WITH WAR CRIMES TRIALS -- THE GOSPIC CASE </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE EXCEPTION AND NOT THE RULE.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, THEY POINT OUT THAT THE GOSPIC CASE IS AN </p><p>INSTRUCTIVE LESSON FOR OTHER CROATIAN JUDGES.  JUSTICE SARIC, </p><p>WHO HAILS FROM THE SAME AREA OF CENTRAL DALMATIA AS ICTY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00680  03 OF 04  260701Z </p><p>FUGITIVE ANTE GOTOVINA, IS EFFECTIVELY OSTRACIZED FROM HER </p><p>COMMUNITY AND MUST LIVE UNDER A CONTINUING CLOUD OF THREAT </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION FROM THE RIGHT-WING. </p><p>13. (C) OUR CONTACTS MAINTAIN THAT UNLESS CROATIA\'S ELITE </p><p>BEGINS TO ENFORCE RIGOROUS JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE AND ETHICAL </p><p>STANDARDS, CROATIAN JUDGES ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO EMULATE </p><p>LOZINA RATHER THAN SARIC.  UNFORTUNATELY, CHIEF SUPREME COURT </p><p>JUSTICE IVICA CRNIC IS NOT A LEADER, AND HE AND OTHER JUDGES </p><p>ARE OVERLY SENSITIVE TO OUTSIDE CRITICISM.  THEY ARE SLOW TO </p><p>DISCIPLINE THEIR OWN, EVEN WHEN IT IS A CASE AS EGREGIOUS AS </p><p>JUSTICE LOZINA. </p><p> </p><p>14.

AS A NEXT STEP, WE ARE SCHEDULED TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>GOSPIC CASE AND VARIOUS PROPOSALS TO CREATE A SPECIAL WAR </p><p>CRIMES COURT WITH MINISTER OF JUSTICE ANTICEVIC-MARINOVIC </p><p>APRIL 2. </p><p> </p><p>17 (C) DOMESTIC WAR CRIMES TRIALS CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE </p><p>WAS A DARKER SIDE TO CROATIA\'S INDEPENDENCE WAR AND HELP </p><p>NEUTRALIZE A HOT-BUTTON ELECTORAL ISSUE THAT THE POLITICAL </p><p>RIGHT MIGHT OTHERWISE EXPLOIT.  ULTIMATELY, LOCAL PROSECUTION </p><p>OF WAR CRIMES TRIALS WILL STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW AND HELP </p><p>PRODUCE A MORE STABLE AND SELF-ASSURED CROATIA THAT IS </p><p>CAPABLE OF TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE REGION.  IF </p><p>SANADER\'S STATEMENT IS ANY INDICATION, WE CAN EXPECT THAT </p><p>BAJIC AND OTHER ACTIVISTS WILL BE REMOVED OR SIDELINED AND </p><p>THIS IMPORTANT PROCESS WILL STOP, IF CROATIA\'S </p><p>UNRECONSTRUCTED RIGHT RETURNS TO POWER. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
