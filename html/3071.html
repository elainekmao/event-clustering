<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001675 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KAMPALA FOR AID - DAWN LIBERI; RIYADH FOR POL - R. </p><p>HANKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 5/23/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EINV, ETRD, BTIO, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO NOT WILLING TO OVERTURN </p><p>TARIFF -- PROCTOR AND GAMBLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1594 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE TIM ANDREWS. REASON 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) During a late evening May 18 conversation with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter (rest of meeting reported reftel), </p><p>President Obasanjo remarked that he would not reverse </p><p>the decision raising the tariffs on detergent, </p><p>including Proctor and Gamble\'s Ariel brand. While </p><p>wanting to encourage Proctor and Gamble (P&G) to </p><p>invest heavily in Nigeria, he would not tilt the </p><p>economic playing field in the company\'s favor, he </p><p>stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ambassador Jeter explained that P&G wanted to </p><p>invest but the only way the investment was feasible </p><p>would be if P&G made a profit from their Ibadan </p><p>operation. By decimating Ariel\'s price </p><p>competitiveness, the tariff would reduce sales and </p><p>profits, thus rendering the company\'s investment plan </p><p>unworkable. Obasanjo responded that he could not show </p><p>favoritism to P&G just because it was an American </p><p>company. That was not the free market and fair </p><p>competition, he quipped. Other detergent manufacturers </p><p>faced the same situation but had built production </p><p>facilities here. Lifting the tariff would unfairly </p><p>penalize these companies, something Obasanjo said he </p><p>was not prepared to do. Despite his opposition to </p><p>Proctor and Gamble\'s position, Obasanjo stated that he </p><p>would be willing to talk to Proctor and Gamble </p><p>officials when he visited Washington in mid-June. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
