<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KINSHASA 000061 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/30/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: VERDICT IN LAURENT KABILA ASSASSINATION TRIAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: KINSHASA 793 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF LAURA ENGELBRECHT, REASONS 1.5 B & D </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) ON DECEMBER 7, JUDGES FOR THE HIGHEST DRC MILITARY </p><p>COURT HANDED DOWN THEIR VERDICT IN TRIAL OF PERSONS ACCUSED </p><p>IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF FORMER PRESIDENT </p><p>LAURENT KABILA.  OF THE 130 PERSONS ON TRIAL: </p><p> </p><p>-- 30 WERE GIVEN THE DEATH PENALTY (SIX OF WHOM FLED THE </p><p>COUNTRY IN 2000 AND WERE SENTENCED IN ABSENTIA), </p><p>-- 29 WERE GIVEN LIFE IMPRISONMENT, </p><p>-- 45 WERE ACQUITTED, </p><p>-- 24 RECEIVED PRISON SENTENCES BETWEEN 6 MONTHS AND 20 </p><p>YEARS, </p><p>-- ONE WAS ACQUITTED OF TREASON BUT WILL BE RECHARGED WITH </p><p>THEFT (IN CIVILIAN COURTS), AND </p><p>-- THE CAUSE OF DEATH OF ASSASSIN RACHIDI MIZELE -- WHO WAS </p><p>IN TURN KILLED ON THE SPOT BY EDDY KAPEND (SEE PARA 3 BELOW) </p><p>-- WAS RULED "EXTINCTION BY PUBLIC ACTION." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) LAURENT KABILA\'S ECONOMIC ADVISOR M. MOTA, WHO WAS </p><p>THE ONLY DIRECT WITNESS TO THE ASSASSINATION AND WHO WAS </p><p>ARRESTED DURING THE TRIAL FOR GIVING CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY, </p><p>REMAINS UNDER CONTINUING INVESTIGATION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) AMONG THOSE CONDEMNED TO DEATH ARE COLONEL EDDY </p><p>KAPEND, LAURENT KABILA\'S AIDE-DE-CAMP; GENERAL YAV NAWEJ, </p><p>FORMER GENERAL IN CHARGE OF ARMY FORCES IN KINSHASA; GEORGES </p><p>LETA, FORMER HEAD OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY; AND 6 </p><p>OTHER PRIMARY SUSPECTS WHO FLED THE COUNTRY IN 2000 AND WERE </p><p>TRIED AND SENTENCED IN ABSENTIA.  AMONG THOSE ACQUITTED WERE </p><p>THE WIVES OF SUSPECTS WHO HAD FLED THE COUNTRY; THEY HAD BEEN </p><p>CHARGED WITH FACILITATING THEIR HUSBANDS\' ESCAPE FROM PRISON. </p><p> (SEE REF A FOR A SUMMARY OF KEY PLAYERS IN THE TRIAL.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WHILE THE VERDICT ADDRESSED THE SPECIFIC CHARGES </p><p>AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS, IT DID NOT GIVE A "FINAL" VERSION OF </p><p>EVENTS IN THE ASSASSINATION.  THE COURT ANNOUNCED THAT, </p><p>DESPITE THE HANDING DOWN OF 130 VERDICTS, AN OFFICIAL </p><p>INVESTIGATION WOULD CONTINUE TO "CLARIFY AREAS THAT REMAIN </p><p>SHADOWED" IN THE ASSASSINATION.  IN THE VERDICT, THERE WAS NO </p><p>MENTION OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY OTHER WESTERN COUNTRY AS </p><p>BEING COMPLICIT IN THE ASSASSINATION, AN ISSUE OF SOME </p><p>CONCERN AT THE START OF THE TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) THE MILITARY COURT HAS NO APPEALS PROCESS; HOWEVER, </p><p>BEFORE THE DEATH SENTENCES CAN BE CARRIED OUT, PRESIDENT </p><p>KABILA MUST GIVE PERSONAL APPROVAL.  ALL OF THE LOCAL PAPERS </p><p>-- INCLUDING PRO-OPPOSITION TITLES -- COVERED THE VERDICT </p><p>EXTENSIVELY, AND MOST EDITORIALS APPROVED OF THE RESULTS, </p><p>CALLING IT "BALANCED" AND EVIDENCE THAT THE COURT WORK </p><p>INDEPENDENTLY (SINCE THE PROSECUTOR CALLED FOR 115 DEATH </p><p>SENTENCES AND ONLY 30 WERE HANDED OUT).  HARDLINE </p><p>PRO-GOVERNMENT \'L\'AVENIR\' WAS CRITICAL OF THE VERDICT FOR </p><p>FAILING TO ADDRESS WHAT IT TERMED THE "INTERNATIONAL PLOT" </p><p>THAT LED TO LAURENT KABILA\'S DEATH.  THIS SAME EDITORIAL </p><p>PREDICTED  THAT INTERNATIONAL NGOS WILL LIKELY ASK FOR </p><p>CLEMENCY FOR THOSE CONDEMNED TO DEATH, SHOWING THAT THEY </p><p>DON\'T UNDERSTAND THAT KILLING A HEAD OF STATE IS SUCH A </p><p>SERIOUS CRIME THAT IT DEMANDS DEATH.  SO FAR, INTERNATIONAL </p><p>NGOS SUCH AS ICRC AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAW GROUP HAVE NOT MADE </p><p>STATEMENTS ON THE TRIAL; THEY ARE EXAMINING THE VERDICT TO </p><p>ASSESS THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE SENTENCES IN EACH CATEGORY </p><p>AND ARE LIKELY TO URGE PRESIDENT KABILA TO SUSPEND THE DEATH </p><p>SENTENCES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT:  THE TRIAL STAGE IN THE DRAMA OF THE LAURENT </p><p>KABILA ASSASSINATION HAS BEEN CONCLUDED, ALTHOUGH MANY </p><p>QUESTIONS REMAIN AND THE COURT HAS ORDERED A CONTINUED </p><p>INVESTIGATION INTO KABILA\'S DEATH.  ALL EYES ARE NOW ON </p><p>JOSEPH KABILA CONCERNING THE DEATH PENALTIES -- WILL HE </p><p>SUSPEND THEM OR ALLOW THE EXECUTIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT? </p><p>INTERNATIONAL NGOS AND THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY IN COUNTRIES </p><p>OPPOSED TO THE DEATH PENALTY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY PLACE PRESSURE </p><p>ON KABILA TO SUSPEND THE SENTENCES.  HOWEVER, THERE IS AT </p><p>LEAST SOME POPULAR PRESSURE AMONG THE CONGOLESE TO CARRY THEM </p><p>OUT, PARTLY TO PROVE THAT HE IS "TOUGH" AND TAKES THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF HIS FATHER SERIOUSLY.  SINCE INHERITING THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY, JOSEPH KABILA HAS SUSPENDED ALL DEATH SENTENCES </p><p>PRONOUNCED BY THE MILITARY OR CIVILIAN COURTS.  HE HAS GIVEN </p><p>NO INDICATION HOW HE WILL PROCEED WITH THIS POLITICAL HOT </p><p>POTATO INVOLVING THOSE FOUND GUILTY IN HIS OWN FATHER\'S DEATH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p></p></div>
