<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 GUATEMALA 001596 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, MOPS, PREL, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: LAST CHANCE FOR JUSTICE IN MACK CASE </p><p> </p><p>REF: GUATEMALA 1535 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Human Rights Officer Katharine Read, reasons 1.5 (B and </p><p>D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: On June 19, Helen Mack, the prosecution, and </p><p>the defense presented oral arguments before the Supreme Court </p><p>for the final appeal in the case against the three retired </p><p>military officers allegedly responsible for ordering the </p><p>murder of Myrna Mack in September 1990.  All three officers </p><p>were released from jail by the Fourth Appeals Court on May 7, </p><p>and will continue to remain so unless the Supreme Court </p><p>convicts them and orders their detention.  Representatives </p><p>from fifteen different diplomatic missions were present, </p><p>including 11 Ambassadors whom the Ambassador personally </p><p>recruited to show widespread international support for </p><p>securing justice in Guatemalan human rights cases.  The </p><p>Supreme Court expects a verdict within ten to fifteen days, </p><p>though Mack doubts deliberations will be that swift.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Setting the Stage </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On June 19, the Supreme Court held the public audience </p><p>for the oral arguments in the case against the so-called </p><p>"intellectual authors" of anthropologist Myrna Mack\'s </p><p>September 1990 murder.  The defendants, (ret.) General Godoy </p><p>Gaitan, (ret.) Colonel Valencia Osorio, nor (ret.) Colonel </p><p>Oliva Carrera, did not attend the proceedings, but were </p><p>represented by their lawyers.  Prosecutor Mynor Melgar, </p><p>lawyer Roberto Romero, and Helen Mack presented the appeal </p><p>(casacion in Spanish) of the Fourth Appeals Court\'s May 7 </p><p>decision, which overturned the conviction they won against </p><p>Valencia Osorio on October 3, 2002. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador made calls to resident ambassadors </p><p>urging them to attend the trial to demonstrate the </p><p>committment of the international community to securing </p><p>justice in this long delayed case.  Chiefs of Mission from </p><p>the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Argentina, Sweden, </p><p>Mexico, Germany, Chile, Norway, France, Canada, and Japan, as </p><p>well as representatives from Denmark, Switzerland, and </p><p>MINUGUA attended the trial.  The international community\'s </p><p>presence was noted in local press and given much fanfare. </p><p>The attendance of a number of Latin American ambassadors -- </p><p>including Mexico -- to a human rights trial in Guatemala was </p><p>historic. </p><p> </p><p>The Lawyers Proceed </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Prosecutor Mynor Melgar and Mack Foundation lawyer </p><p>Roberto Romero argued that the Fourth Appeals Court emitted </p><p>an erroneous, illegal sentence that was not based on the </p><p>appeals of either the defense of the prosecution.  They asked </p><p>that the Supreme Court uphold the October 2003 conviction of </p><p>Valencia Osorio and also convict Godoy Gaitan and Oliva </p><p>Carrera. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The defense for Valencia Osorio argued that the </p><p>October 3, 2002, sentence was contradictory because it did </p><p>not clarify the discrepancy between individual and </p><p>institutional responsibility; while admitting that Valencia </p><p>Osorio transmitted an order to convicted material author Noel </p><p>de Jesus Beteta Alvarez to murder Myrna Mack, the defense </p><p>argued that he was not the "author" of the crime.  Therefore, </p><p>Valencia Osorio\'s lawyer asked that the Supreme Court confirm </p><p>the May 7, 2003, decision of the Fourth Appeals Court and </p><p>leave his client free. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The defense for Godoy Gaitan and Oliva Carrera argued </p><p>that both the Third Sentencing Court and the Fourth Appeals </p><p>Court absolved their clients of guilt and that this Supreme </p><p>Court appeal (casacion) should not apply to either one. </p><p> </p><p>Helen Mack\'s Final Words </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Helen Mack, as the private plaintiff and family </p><p>representative in the case, spoke last.  Mack passionately </p><p>recounted the thirteen-year quest for justice in her sister\'s </p><p>case, then moved to the need for real reform in Guatemala\'s </p><p>rule of law and access to justice.  She said the Supreme </p><p>Court had one final opportunity to demonstrate the integrity </p><p>of the Guatemalan judicial system by giving out a just </p><p>sentence, applying the penal code to the credible evidence </p><p>she and her team had presented. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Sources at the Supreme Court and in the press </p><p>speculate that the Supreme Court will reach a verdict within </p><p>ten to fifteen days, though Romero and Mack expect the judges </p><p>to drag their heels. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Mack has told us that this is the final stage in the </p><p>legal battle she and her team will fight in Guatemala, while </p><p>the case remains pending in the Inter-American Court.  We </p><p>will continue monitoring both processes with great interest </p><p>and support. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The real challenge for the Supreme Court seems to be </p><p>deciding the precedent that their ruling will set.  If the </p><p>judges rule that Valencia Osorio can be held accountable for </p><p>intellectual authorship in the murder of Myrna Mack, this </p><p>could have profound repercussions for other cases against </p><p>high-ranking military leaders involved in ordering or </p><p>transmitting orders for countless murders, massacres, and </p><p>disappearances of civilians during the internal conflict. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) On the other hand, if the judges decide that material </p><p>authorship alone constitutes guilt, these individual leaders </p><p>will be absolved for acting in line with state policies. </p><p>Such a ruling by the Supreme Court would be a setback for </p><p>domestic justice in human rights cases involving the internal </p><p>conflict, forcing Guatemalan activists to consider other </p><p>avenues for reconciliation and reparations. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
