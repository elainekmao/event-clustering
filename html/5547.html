<p>UNCLAS ROME 000473 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IZ, IT, PREL, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY SUPPORTIVE OF POWELL\'S FEB. 5 UNSC </p><p>PRESENTATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 31246 </p><p> </p><p>     B. ROME 444 </p><p>     C. SECSTATE 34169 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: PM BERLUSCONI ENDORSED SECRETARY POWELL\'S </p><p>FEB. 5 PRESENTATION AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND CALLED FOR </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO REMAIN UNITED AND KEEP THE </p><p>PRESSURE ON SADDAM TO DISARM.  WHILE SAYING THAT WAR SHOULD </p><p>BE THE VERY LAST MEASURE, THE PM CONTINUES TO STATE CLEARLY </p><p>THAT THE ONLY WAY FOR SADDAM TO AVOID A WAR IS TO DESTROY </p><p>IRAQ\'S WMDS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE FOLLOWING IS AN INFORMAL TRANSLATION OF THE GOI </p><p>STATEMENT FOLLOWING THE SECRETARY\'S FEB. 5 SPEECH AT THE UNSC: </p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p>PRIME MINISTER SILVIO BERLUSCONI EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR </p><p>THE CONTENT OF THE SPEECH TODAY BY U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE </p><p>POWELL.  POWELL AUTHORITATIVELY DEMONSTRATED WITH A WEALTH OF </p><p>AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIAL THAT IRAQ DID NOT COOPERATE ACTIVELY </p><p>WITH THE INSPECTORS, DID NOT PROVIDE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF THE </p><p>ELIMINATION OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS OF MASS </p><p>DESTRUCTION IN ITS POSSESSION, AND DID NOT PROVIDE THE </p><p>CERTAINTY OF THE ACTUAL FREEZING OF HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  THE </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE HAS INSTEAD DEMONSTRATED THAT THE IRAQI </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>REGIME HAS REPEATEDLY OBSTRUCTED THE WORK OF THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS MISSION AND CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN A CONNECTION WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  IRAQ\'S MANIFEST AND REPEATED </p><p>VIOLATION OF THE UN RESOLUTIONS, WHICH WAS TODAY FURTHER </p><p>DEMONSTRATED BEFORE THE SECURITY COUNCIL, CONFIRMS THE NEED </p><p>FOR A RESOLUTE ATTITUDE BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO </p><p>PRESERVE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO PROTECT </p><p>PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE WORLD.  END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) FOLLOWING OUR REQUEST FOR SUPPORTING THE SECRETARY\'S </p><p>FEB. 5 UNSC PRESENTATION (REF B,) BERLUSCONI MADE THE </p><p>FOLLOWING POINTS ON IRAQ IN A FEB. 4 PRESS CONFERENCE IN ROME </p><p>WITH THE PORTUGUESE PM: </p><p>-- SADDAM HUSSEIN MUST PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT IRAQ HAS </p><p>DESTROYED OR IS DESTROYING ITS CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  ONLY THEN </p><p>CAN HE BE CERTAIN TO AVOID WAR. </p><p>-- AN ATTACK AGAINST IRAQ WOULD PROBABLY NOT INCREASE THE </p><p>THREAT OF TERROR ATTACKS.  "I THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE ALREADY </p><p>HAVE THEIR REASONS FOR HATE." </p><p>-- "IF THERE WILL BE AN INTERVENTION, I HOPE THERE WILL BE A </p><p>UN RESOLUTION TO LEGITIMIZE THAT INTERVENTION." </p><p>-- IF SADDAM HUSSEIN WERE FREE OF FAULT, IT WOULD BE EASY FOR </p><p>HIM TO SAY WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  THIS IS </p><p>WHY IRAQ HAS TO STOP PRETENDING IT IS HELPING THE INSPECTORS. </p><p> IT HAS THE OBLIGATION TO SAY WHERE THESE WEAPONS ARE. </p><p>-- NATO HAS GUARANTEED YEARS AND YEARS OF PEACE TO THE WORLD, </p><p>HENCE OUR "GRATITUDE."  "WE MUST HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY THAT </p><p>DURING THE LAST 60 YEARS WE HAVE LIVED AT THE EXPENSE OF </p><p>AMERICAN TAXPAYERS.  IT IS THANKS TO THEM THAT WE ARE FREE </p><p>FROM DICTATORSHIPS." </p><p>-- "THE SITUATION IS SERIOUS, WE ARE NOT HIDING OUR HEAD </p><p>UNDER THE SAND.  WE WANT PEACE, BUT WE ALSO WANT TO DEFEND </p><p>OUR POPULATIONS FROM TERRORISM." </p><p>-- THE CHOICE OF WAR IS FOR SADDAM TO MAKE.  "HE MUST START </p><p>TO COOPERATE SERIOUSLY WITH THE INSPECTORS.  SADDAM HUSSEIN </p><p>HAS THE CHOICE OF WHETHER TO OPEN UP TO THE INSPECTORS OR TO </p><p>ACCEPT EXILE AND AN IMMUNITY GUARANTEED BY A FURTHER UN </p><p>RESOLUTION.  IF HE WILL NOT MAKE THIS CHOICE, I THINK IT WILL </p><p>BE DIFFICULT NOT TO INTERVENE." </p><p>-- THERE IS NO NEED TO FIND THE SMOKING GUN TO DRAFT ANOTHER </p><p>UN RESOLUTION AND LEGITIMIZE A WAR AGAINST IRAQ.  PASSIVE </p><p>RESISTANCE ON SADDAM\'S PART AND UNWILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE </p><p>WOULD BE ENOUGH TO ATTACK. </p><p>-- ON ITALY\'S AVAILABILITY ON IRAQ, IT WILL BE TO PROVIDE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, LOGISTIC SUPPORT AND MILITARY POLICE </p><p>DUTIES TO GUARANTEE SECURITY AFTER THE WAR. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) BERLUSCONI IS SCHEDULED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE CHAMBER </p><p>OF DEPUTIES AND THE SENATE IN ROME FEB. 6 AT 1600 LOCAL TIME. </p><p> HE IS EXPECTED TO ONCE AGAIN ENDORSE THE SECRETARY\'S </p><p>PRESENTATION AT THE UNSC FEB.5.  HE IS ALSO EXPECTED TO SAY </p><p>THAT A SECOND UN RESOLUTION WOULD BE NEEDED TO "FULLY </p><p>LEGITIMIZE" A MILITARY INTERVENTION AGAINST IRAQ.  BERLUSCONI </p><p>IS EXPECTED TO SAY THAT ITALY HAS NOT BEEN ASKED TO DEPLOY </p><p>COMBAT FORCES TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTION </p><p>BUT WOULD PROVIDE PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES FOR HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE, LOGISTICAL SUPPORT, AND MILITARY POLICE TO </p><p>GUARANTEE SECURITY AFTER THE WAR. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003ROME00473 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
