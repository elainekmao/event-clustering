Papers comment that U.S. has the </p><p>IMF `trump card\' in hand against Turkey.  U.S. might go </p><p>further and bar Turks from entering northern Iraq, and </p><p>cooperate with the Kurds in the region, papers say.  U.S. </p><p>might also withdraw support from Turkey on crucial issues </p><p>like the EU, Cyprus, and Armenian genocide, papers indicate. </p><p>However, closing of northern front will claim more money and </p><p>lives on the U.S. side, comments note.  U.S. cannot afford </p><p>to break the U.S., Israel, Turkey triangle or let Turkey </p><p>join the Germany, France axis in Europe, papers add. </p><p>"Hurriyet" says the visiting U.S. House of Representatives </p><p>delegation did not attend a scheduled meeting with Turks at </p><p>the MFA on Thursday as a reaction to Turkey\'s demands for </p><p>more economic aid.  Prime Minister Gul is expected to make a </p><p>statement about Turkey\'s position after talks with the </p><p>Americans today.  Observers expect the parliament to approve </p><p>soon deployment of U.S. troops in Turkey. Papers agree that </p><p>the U.S. has presented an ultimatum to Turkey, but then </p><p>chose to tone down.  "Hurriyet" quotes a `senior AKP </p><p>official\' as saying Turkey could not wait for the </p><p>Congressional approval of aid, and that the money should be </p><p>transferred to Turkey via private banks.  "Aksam" claims </p><p>that in talks, the U.S. was putting the emphasis on the </p><p>status of U.S. troops to be deployed in Turkey, exemption of </p><p>troops from VAT, and the cost of ID cards for American </p><p>soldiers.  Meanwhile, following reports about Iran deploying </p><p>5,000 special troops in northern Iraq, Turkey sent 7,000 </p><p>soldiers to control strategic points in the region, </p><p>"Cumhuriyet" reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas strongly criticized </p><p>the UN Cyprus envoy De Soto for presenting the third Annan </p><p>plan to Ankara before submitting it to the Turkish Cypriots, </p><p>say papers.  Denktas said the revised plan has increased the </p><p>number of Greek Cypriots to be settled in the Turkish sector </p><p>to 85,000 from the previous 60,000.  Under the new plan, </p><p>Turkish Cypriots will be given the status of `protected </p><p>minority,\' Denktas reportedly said.  U.S. Special Cyprus </p><p>Coordinator Tom Weston is expected in Ankara over the </p><p>weekend before proceeding to the island next week, papers </p><p>say. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan eligible to run in by-elections:  High Election </p><p>Board (YSK) has rejected objections to AKP leader Erdogan\'s </p><p>participation in Siirt by-elections on March 9, and </p><p>announced that Erdogan was eligible to run for parliament. </p><p>Siirt elections might clear the path for Erdogan to the post </p><p>of the Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Standoff with Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ankara\'s stance" </p><p>Murat Yetkin noted in liberal-intellectual Radikal (2/21): </p><p>"Ankara refrains from giving an image as if declaring a war </p><p>to its neighbor in the absence of a UNSC resolution.  The </p><p>Turkish decision experiences delay also due to both NATO and </p><p>the EU\'s failure to reach a unanimous stance on the Iraq </p><p>issue.  On the other hand, keeping up the good relations </p><p>with the US is a major concern for Ankara.  Turkey does not </p><p>want to see bilateral relations get hurt.  It looks like </p><p>there is a formula to be applied in order to break the </p><p>current deadlock.  The government might prepare the </p><p>authorization request for the movement of US troops in </p><p>Turkey, and send it to the parliament.  Due to the </p><p>parliamentary calendar, the Parliament will reconvene on the </p><p>25th, which practically provides an extra four days for both </p><p>the ongoing negotiations between Turkey and the US and the </p><p>ongoing efforts for a peaceful settlement with Iraq.  As it </p><p>seems, Washington is not going to decline such a formula." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"If Turkey says `yes\'" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (2/21): "Regardless </p><p>of whether Turkey stays in or out, the war will present </p><p>Turkey with a series of serious economic losses. </p><p>Cooperation with the US is the only way to be able to </p><p>compensate the loss to a certain degree.  In the case of a </p><p>`no\' answer, Turkey will have to deal with this issue alone. </p><p>What the government is doing right now is actually a neck-to- </p><p>neck bargaining to provide the best possible compensation </p><p>plan for Turkey. . Yet it is very important not to be </p><p>eccentric or excessive with the demands and not to push the </p><p>other side\'s limits of tolerance.  Despite some tactical </p><p>mistakes along the way, Ankara pursued a good negotiation </p><p>process with the US on military, political and economic </p><p>issues.  . Once Turkey comes up with a clear `yes\' answer, </p><p>it will also help Turkey for the implementation of a policy </p><p>on northern Iraq and the whole Iraq based on Turkey\'s </p><p>interests and security concerns. . To be able to have an </p><p>active say in the regional reshaping, Turkey should be able </p><p>to act under the requirements of its geo-strategic </p><p>importance." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
