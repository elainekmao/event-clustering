SUMMARY:  This cable summarizes the strategies </p><p>and activities undertaken by USAID and CDC to build </p><p>national and local capacities to alleviate the </p><p>impact of HIV/AIDS and reduce the stigma and </p><p>discrimination associated with the disease.  Key to </p><p>USAID and CDC\'s efforts are technical assistance </p><p>to the National Action Committee on AIDS (NACA) and </p><p>its nascent state and local counterparts (i.e. SACAs </p><p>and LACAs) as well as the Federal Ministry of Health </p><p>(FMOH); capacity building for non-governmental </p><p>organizations (NGOs); care and support of people </p><p>living with AIDS (PLWA) and people affected by AIDS </p><p>(PABA) and the central involvement of PLWAs in all </p><p>activities; the training of voluntary counseling and </p><p>testing (VCT) personnel and the development of VCT </p><p>centers; the involvement of faith based </p><p>organizations and religious leaders; and the use of </p><p>mass media and advocacy.  With our increase in </p><p>HIV/AIDS funding, USAID will become the largest </p><p>financial donor in FY 03, followed by the World </p><p>Bank.  CDC is the major source of technical </p><p>assistance to the FMOH.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Overview: The first case of AIDS in Nigeria was </p><p>reported in 1986, and the Government of the Federal </p><p>Republic of Nigeria (GON) conducted the first HIV </p><p>sentinel sero-prevalence survey in 1990.  In </p><p>1990/91, the national prevalence rate was roughly </p><p>1.8%.  Over the past twelve years this rate has </p><p>steadily risen to 5.8% in 2001 - an increase of more </p><p>300 percent.  Currently, there are roughly over 3.5 </p><p>million Nigerians living with HIV/AIDS.  Nigeria has </p><p>the highest number of HIV/AIDS infected adults in </p><p>West Africa and accounts for 11% of worldwide </p><p>HIV/AIDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Working with the Government: Two years ago, </p><p>President Olusegun Obasanjo established the National </p><p>Action Committee on AIDS (NACA), a policy and </p><p>coordination body that reports directly to him and </p><p>pursues a multisectoral approach to HIV/AIDS.  USAID </p><p>and CDC have supported NACA since its inception, </p><p>supplying technical assistance to the organization </p><p>on many occasions.  For example, the USAID-funded </p><p>policy Project assisted NACA to develop the HIV/AIDS </p><p>Emergency Action Plan (HEAP) that provides the </p><p>framework for the national effort and helped NACA </p><p>draft the National HIV/AIDS policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  In July, seemingly out of frustration for NACA\'s </p><p>inability to move as quickly as he had hoped, </p><p>President Obasanjo disbanded NACA to create a new </p><p>coordination and implementation structure under the </p><p>Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), the National AIDS </p><p>Prevention and Control Agency (NAPCA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  USAID, the World Bank, and Britain\'s Department for </p><p>International Development (DfiD), the three major </p><p>HIV/AIDS donors in Nigeria, were concerned that creation </p><p>of NAPCA under the FMOH might hamper the </p><p>multisectoral national effort and that there was an </p><p>inherent conflict of interest in a national </p><p>structure that both coordinated and implemented </p><p>programs.  The three donors endorsed an effort </p><p>leading to the re-establishment of NACA under a more </p><p>energetic leadership with greater direct access to </p><p>the President through the reactivation of the </p><p>Presidential Committee on AIDS (PCA).  USAID is </p><p>attempting to help the new NACA leadership with </p><p>provision of technical assistance to:  a) map donor </p><p>supported HIV/AIDS activities nationwide;  b) develop </p><p>an advocacy campaign in support of the bill to make </p><p>NACA a legal entity;  and c) develop a national media </p><p>campaign to combat stigma and discrimination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Working to improve NACA is only part of USAID\'s </p><p>efforts to build institutional capacity.  We realize </p><p>the relationship and division of responsibilities </p><p>between NACA and state and local government </p><p>structures are still evolving and that tensions exist. </p><p>To facilitate and expedite the development process, </p><p>both USAID and the CDC have developed projects that </p><p>provide technical assistance and support to the </p><p>SACAs and LACAs in four USAID focus states (Lagos, </p><p>Kano, Taraba and Anambra). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  The CDC provides funding to the National </p><p>Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors </p><p>(NASTAD) to work with NACA and SACA representatives </p><p>to develop models of state level organizations </p><p>appropriate to Nigeria.  In a complementary fashion, </p><p>the USAID-funded IMPACT (Implementing AIDs </p><p>Prevention and Control Activities) Project works to raise </p><p>the level of political awareness and commitment of policy- </p><p>makers in support of HIV/AIDS programs at the local </p><p>level.  Technical assistance to the LACA includes </p><p>training in management, advocacy and community </p><p>mobilization, and monitoring and evaluation.  The </p><p>success of this project will be measured by </p><p>increased funding from the local governments to the </p><p>LACA and by increased referrals and coordination </p><p>among the groups working in HIV/AIDS.  Although </p><p>neither the CDC nor IMPACT efforts are mature enough </p><p>to be evaluated at this point, preliminary observations </p><p>are encouraging.  Other donors are monitoring these </p><p>projects with an eye to replication in other states </p><p>and local government areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  Cooperating with Civil Society:  Civil society </p><p>organizations suffered enormously during military </p><p>rule.  One of the greatest challenges facing the </p><p>Mission is building the capacity of local non- </p><p>governmental organizations (NGOs) and community- </p><p>based organizations (CBOs).  In the HIV/AIDS arena, </p><p>USAID supports over 60 local NGOs to build capacity. </p><p>The 60-plus local NGOs receiving this intensive </p><p>capacity building will increase access to better </p><p>quality HIV/AIDS services in their areas.  Target </p><p>populations include sex workers and their clients, </p><p>transport workers, religious organizations, youth, </p><p>trade unions and the uniformed services. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Raising Public Awareness - PLWA/PABA:   USAID is </p><p>recognized as the major donor to projects for people </p><p>living with AIDS (PLWA) and people affected by AIDS </p><p>(PABA).  Some USAID-supported projects have a </p><p>national reach while others are localized.  The </p><p>focus of these projects includes documenting general </p><p>human rights violations as well as the </p><p>discrimination faced by PLWA at medical facilities. </p><p>It also includes radio call-in shows run by PLWA </p><p>to local support groups run by PLWA to community- </p><p>based care and support projects for PLWA and PABA. </p><p>USAID, for example, piloted the first two community- </p><p>based projects for orphans and vulnerable children </p><p>(OVC) in Nigeria.  These projects, located in areas </p><p>with the highest HIV prevalence in the country, will </p><p>not be formally evaluated until October.  However, it </p><p>is obvious that these projects have galvanized </p><p>support for PLWA and PABA and have lessened the AIDS </p><p>stigma while energizing open discussion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Previous to project implementation, the stigma </p><p>of HIV was so great in Benue State that there were </p><p>instances of violent demonstrations against anyone </p><p>who spoke publicly on the issue.  As a result of the </p><p>OVC project, traditional and political leaders in </p><p>Benue now hold meetings and openly discuss the </p><p>gravity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in public fora. </p><p>USAID also funded Population Services </p><p>Internationals\' highly acclaimed televised anti- </p><p>discrimination campaign during the World Cup and </p><p>USAID will support NACA to develop a national media </p><p>campaign to combat stigma.  In another project, </p><p>USAID is supporting the production of videos </p><p>containing testimonials of PLWA that will be used </p><p>extensively to put a human face to the epidemic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. The CDC is a major donor in terms of supplying </p><p>technical assistance to the FMOH and NACA to improve </p><p>prevention, care and treatment services to PLWA. </p><p>For example, the CDC recently assisted the FMOH to </p><p>complete site assessments of the three university </p><p>teaching hospitals that that will serve as training </p><p>centers for different cadres of health workers on </p><p>comprehensive patient care including home-based </p><p>care. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Faith-Based Approaches:  Other successful </p><p>strategies that USAID has utilized to overcome </p><p>stigma and discrimination is support to faith-based </p><p>initiatives and the recruitment of religious leaders </p><p>to advise  non-faith based projects.  Muslim and </p><p>Christian clergy alike have considerable influence </p><p>on the beliefs and attitudes of their followers. </p><p>USAID funded projects recognize this influence and </p><p>enlist these leaders in most undertakings.  For </p><p>instance, a required component of all community- </p><p>based projects supported through the USAID-funded </p><p>IMPACT Project is a Project Advisory Committee </p><p>(PAC).  A PAC is composed of local leaders who meet </p><p>monthly.  They advise on project activities and how </p><p>to present a project\'s objectives before the </p><p>community.  Religious leaders are always included as </p><p>PAC members.  Thus, the project with the Kano State </p><p>branch of the National Transport Workers Union has </p><p>several Muslim and traditional leaders whose counsel </p><p>has allowed project staff to promote condom use in a </p><p>socially acceptable manner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. Other USAID-supported projects target the </p><p>religious leaders themselves for interventions. </p><p>The project with Church of Christ in Nigeria </p><p>(COCIN), a major social and political force in the </p><p>Middle Belt region, is an outstanding example of </p><p>this approach. Due to USAID-sponsored interventions, </p><p>COCIN\'s leadership has dramatically changed its </p><p>original stance that equated HIV infection with </p><p>punishment from God and forbade condom use.  The </p><p>COCIN hierarchy now accepts that HIV/AIDS is a major </p><p>danger to the church and its members; they actively </p><p>support people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); and </p><p>promote condom use within the confines of marriage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. Another critical component of USAID\'s effort to </p><p>alleviate stigma and discrimination is the training </p><p>of voluntary testing and counseling (VCT) personnel and </p><p>the establishment of the first two dedicated </p><p>voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) centers in </p><p>Nigeria.  The USAID-funded IMPACT Project recently </p><p>opened the country\'s first VCT center in a densely </p><p>populated area of Lagos and will soon open the </p><p>second center in the second largest city, Kano. </p><p>These two urban VCT centers located in the country\'s </p><p>two most populated states serve approximately 37% </p><p>and 32% of their respective state populations. </p><p>There are no other facilities in the country where a </p><p>client can receive pre-test counseling, a rapid HIV </p><p>test and post-test counseling, including referral to </p><p>other services as necessary.  VCT is a critical element </p><p>in prevention.  Those who test negative need to be </p><p>counseled and motivated to maintain or adopt behaviors </p><p>to keep them safe; those who are positive need to be </p><p>counseled to adopt behaviors to protect others from </p><p>infection and themselves from reinfection.  Positive persons </p><p>also need to be referred to services such as support </p><p>groups and treatment for opportunistic infections. </p><p>Some experts believe that decrease in HIV prevalence </p><p>in Uganda is attributable in part to the dramatic </p><p>increase in people receiving VCT services. The </p><p>IMPACT Project has also established 22 other </p><p>Voluntary Counseling Centers (i.e., clients receive </p><p>counseling but must go elsewhere for testing and </p><p>referral to other services) and these represent a </p><p>large proportion of the total counseling centers </p><p>nationwide.  The CDC also supports the FMOH to </p><p>develop models for VCT services in public </p><p>facilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. CONCLUSION:  The national, state, and local </p><p>structures created to lead the HIV/AIDS effort </p><p>across the country and most local NGOs are still primarily </p><p>in their developmental stages but USAID and the CDC are </p><p>major actors in building their capacity.  Discrimination </p><p>against PLWA remains high and is deep seated in Nigeria </p><p>but here again USAID is at the forefront of efforts to </p><p>reduce the stigma.  Another major contribution of the </p><p>CDC has been technical assistance to the National </p><p>Sero-prevalence survey, which provides critical information </p><p>for program development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  Much remains to be done in Nigeria to combat </p><p>the spread of HIV/AIDS and to halt the increase in </p><p>Nigeria\'s HIV prevalence.  AIDS in Nigeria has had a </p><p>terrible personal and familial impact on PLWA and </p><p>PABA.  Increasingly, it is having social and </p><p>economic and political impact that has made Nigerian </p><p>policy-makers take notice.  Appropriate </p><p>programming of  the $90 million World Bank loan, the </p><p>$70 million from the Global Trust Fund and the $40 </p><p>million from the Government of Nigeria budget will </p><p>help but more resources, planning, and personnel as </p><p>well as the political will of all levels of government </p><p>will be needed.  The USG, through USAID and CDC, is </p><p>working with the Government of Nigeria and other </p><p>donors to improve the response to HIV/AIDS and </p><p>ensure services will be in place.  With half the </p><p>population of Nigeria under the age of fifteen, </p><p>another more damaging  wave of the epidemic is </p><p>looming.  The need to mount sufficient remedial and </p><p>prevention efforts in order to face this challenge </p><p>cannot be overstated. Jeter </p><p></p></div>
