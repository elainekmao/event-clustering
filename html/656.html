(U) THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL </p><p>(A).  SEE PARAGRAPH 2. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUESTED: USNS KANE IS </p><p>CONDUCTING UNCLASSIFIED MILITARY SURVEY OPERATIONS, NOT </p><p>MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (MSR), IN THE EEZS OF VARIOUS </p><p>BALTIC STATES INCLUDING SWEDEN.  KANE IS MEASURING </p><p>CURRENTS AND BOTTOM PROFILES, AND COLLECTING WATER AND </p><p>BOTTOM SAMPLES, AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS FOR MILITARY </p><p>PURPOSES.  MILITARY SURVEYS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COASTAL </p><p>STATE CONTROL.  KANE WILL RETURN TO THE SWEDISH EEZ TO </p><p>CONTINUE ITS SURVEY ON OR ABOUT APRIL 16.  DRAWING ON THE </p><p>TALKING POINTS IN PARAGRAPH 5, EMBASSY MAY DELIVER TO </p><p>APPROPRIATE GOS OFFICIALS THE PAPER IN PARAGRAPH 6 WHICH </p><p>PROVIDES A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE LEGAL DIFFERENCES </p><p>BETWEEN SURVEYS AND MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (MSR)  AND </p><p>WORLDWIDE USG POLICY AND PRACTICE WITH RESPECT TO MILITARY </p><p>SURVEYS.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) DEPARTMENT APPRECIATES EMBASSY\'S VIGOROUS AND </p><p>ARTICULATE REACTIONS AND THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THE </p><p>SITUATION REPORTED REFTELS (A) AND (B) REGARDING THE </p><p>UNEXPECTED SWEDISH REACTION TO USNS KANE\'S SURVEY </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN ITS EEZ (REFTEL (C)).  WE HAVE PREPARED A </p><p>DETAILED LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION WHICH IS SET OUT </p><p>IN THE PAPER IN PARAGRAPH 6 THAT MAY BE SHARED WITH </p><p>APPROPRIATE GOS OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) USNS KANE IS SCHEDULED TO COMPLETE ITS PORT VISIT </p><p>IN DENMARK ON 8 APRIL 1994 AND TO ENTER THE WESTERN WATERS </p><p>OF THE SWEDISH EEZ TO CONTINUE MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES </p><p>ON OR ABOUT 16 APRIL.  KANE WILL MEASURE CURRENTS AND </p><p>BOTTOM PROFILES, AND WILL COLLECT WATER AND BOTTOM </p><p>SAMPLES, INCLUDING CORES, AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS FOR </p><p>MILITARY PURPOSES.  IF CHALLENGED DURING THESE ACTIVITIES, </p><p>KANE HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO RESPOND (QUOTE) I AM CONDUCTING </p><p>MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL </p><p>LAW AS REFLECTED IN THE 1982 LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION. </p><p>(UNQUOTE) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) BEGIN TALKING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU A PAPER THAT DESCRIBES THE </p><p>U.S. POSITION ON SURVEY ACTIVITIES IN EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC </p><p>ZONES (EEZ). </p><p> </p><p>-- THIS PAPER DETAILS WHY THE ACTIVITIES OF THE USNS KANE, </p><p>A U.S. NAVAL AUXILIARY, IN YOUR EEZ OVER THE PAST WEEK ARE </p><p>FULLY CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND OUR </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF SWEDISH LAW. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE AGREE THAT A COASTAL STATE MAY REQUIRE ANYONE </p><p>SEEKING TO CONDUCT MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (MSR) IN THE </p><p>COASTAL STATE\'S EEZ OBTAIN APPROVAL IN ADVANCE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>AS THIS PAPER MAKES CLEAR, THE KANE\'S MILITARY SURVEY </p><p>ACTIVITIES ARE NOT MSR. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE MISSION OF THE USNS KANE IN THE SWEDISH EEZ IS TO </p><p>MEASURE CURRENT AND BOTTOM PROFILES, AND TO COLLECT WATER </p><p>AND BOTTOM SAMPLES, INCLUDING CORES, AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS </p><p>FOR MILITARY PURPOSES. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PURPOSE OF THIS MILITARY SURVEY IS TO SUPPORT </p><p>SECURITY IN THE BALTIC SEA, AN ISSUE ON WHICH THE U.S. AND </p><p>SWEDEN SHARE A COMMON CONCERN. </p><p> </p><p>-- SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES AND AS </p><p>SUCH CAN BE UNDERTAKEN IN THE EEZ OF A COASTAL NATION </p><p>WITHOUT PRIOR NOTIFICATION OR APPROVAL BY THE NATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE WANT TO REACH A SHARED UNDERSTANDING WITH YOU ON </p><p>THIS ISSUE.  HOWEVER, WE MUST EMPHASIZE THAT OUR MILITARY </p><p>SURVEY OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ARE CONDUCTED WORLDWIDE ON THAT </p><p>BASIS.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OUR EEZ SURVEY OPERATIONS, </p><p>INCLUDING THAT OF THE KANE, ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE HOPE THAT THIS PAPER PROVIDES YOU WITH THE LEGAL </p><p>FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT OUR POSITION.  WE ARE </p><p>AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER WITH YOU IF YOU WISH. </p><p> </p><p>IF ASKED WHETHER THE USG IS WILLING TO SHARE THE DATA </p><p>COLLECTED, YOU SHOULD RESPOND THAT THE USG DOES NOT SHARE </p><p>DATA COLLECTED ON A MILITARY SURVEY AS A CONDITION OF </p><p>ENTRY INTO THE EEZ.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE ESTABLISHED </p><p>MECHANISMS FOR DATA EXCHANGES BETWEEN OUR TWO </p><p>GOVERNMENTS.  (FYI: EMBASSY MUST AVOID IMPLYING ANY USG </p><p>COMMITMENT TO SHARE THE DATA COLLECTED IN THIS SURVEY BY </p><p>THE KANE.  END FYI) </p><p> </p><p>IF ASKED WHETHER THE KANE PLANS TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS IN </p><p>THE EEZ OFF SWEDEN\'S WESTERN COAST, YOU SHOULD RESPOND </p><p>THAT THE KANE WILL CONTINUE ITS MILITARY SURVEY OPERATIONS </p><p>WITHIN THE SWEDISH WESTERN EEZ NEXT WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>IF PRESSED TO SEND THE KANE BACK INTO THE EEZ TO RECOVER </p><p>THE CURRENT METERS, YOU SHOULD RESPOND THAT THE KANE WILL </p><p>RETRIEVE THEM WITHIN 30 DAYS.  YOU SHOULD STATE THESE </p><p>CURRENT METERS ARE NOT PERMANENTLY FIXED MONITORING </p><p>FACILITIES, AS ALLEGED BY GOS OFFICIALS, BUT ARE METERS </p><p>THAT ARE COLLECTING DATA ON BALTIC CURRENTS AND WILL BE </p><p>RETRIEVED TO OBTAIN THE DATA COLLECTED. </p><p> </p><p>IF PRESSED THAT CORING IS MSR, YOU SHOULD RESPOND THAT </p><p>CORING ACTIVITIES FOR RESEARCH ARE MSR, BUT CORING </p><p>ACTIVITIES FOR MILITARY PURPOSES CONSTITUTE A MILITARY </p><p>SURVEY ACTIVITY.  YOU MAY EXPLAIN THAT, WHILE THE MEANS OF </p><p>DATA COLLECTION USED IN MILITARY SURVEYS MAY SOMETIMES BE </p><p>THE SAME AS THAT USED IN MSR, INFORMATION FROM SUCH </p><p>ACTIVITIES, REGARDLESS OF SECURITY CLASSIFICATION, IS </p><p>INTENDED NOT FOR USE BY THE GENERAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, </p><p>BUT BY THE MILITARY.  END TALKING POINTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>    SURVEY ACTIVITIES IN THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES THE RIGHT OF SWEDEN TO </p><p>REQUIRE PRIOR PERMISSION FOR FOREIGN SHIPS TO CONDUCT </p><p>MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (MSR) IN ITS EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC </p><p>ZONE (EEZ).  THE UNITED STATES IS PLEASED TO PROVIDE THE </p><p>FOLLOWING EXPLANATION WHY HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS AND </p><p>MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES ARE NOT MSR AND DO NOT REQUIRE </p><p>PRIOR NOTIFICATION TO OR THE PERMISSION OF THE COASTAL </p><p>STATE BEFORE OTHER STATES MAY CONDUCT SUCH SURVEYS IN THE </p><p>EEZ. </p><p> </p><p>THE LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION </p><p>------,---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW, AS REFLECTED IN THE 1982 UNITED NATIONS </p><p>CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA (LOS CONVENTION), </p><p>AUTHORIZES COASTAL STATES TO CLAIM LIMITED RIGHTS AND </p><p>JURISDICTION IN AN EEZ.  THE JURISDICTIONAL RIGHTS RELATE </p><p>PRIMARILY TO THE EXPLORATION, EXPLOITATION, AND </p><p>CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES, MSR, AND THE MARINE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT.  BEYOND THE TERRITORIAL SEA (IN WHICH THE </p><p>COASTAL STATE ENJOYS FULL SOVEREIGNTY), ALL STATES ENJOY </p><p>THE FREEDOMS OF NAVIGATION AND OVERFLIGHT AND OTHER </p><p>RELATED USES OF THE SEA WITHIN THE EEZ, PROVIDED THAT THEY </p><p>DO SO WITH DUE REGARD TO THE RIGHTS OF THE COASTAL STATE </p><p>AND OTHER STATES.  SEE ARTICLE 58 OF THE LOS CONVENTION. </p><p> </p><p>SURVEY ACTIVITIES VS. MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH </p><p>--------------------------------,------------ --- </p><p> </p><p>THE RIGHTS ALL STATES ENJOY INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT </p><p>SURVEY ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE EEZ.  SURVEY ACTIVITIES ARE </p><p>NOT MSR.  THE LOS CONVENTION DISTINGUISHES CLEARLY BETWEEN </p><p>THE CONCEPTS OF "RESEARCH" AND "MSR" ON THE ONE HAND AND </p><p>"HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS" AND "SURVEY ACTIVITIES" ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND.  ARTICLE 19(2)(J) OF THE LOS CONVENTION </p><p>INCLUDES "RESEARCH OR SURVEY ACTIVITIES" AS INCONSISTENT </p><p>WITH INNOCENT PASSAGE IN THE TERRITORIAL SEA.  ARTICLE </p><p>21(1)(G) AUTHORIZES THE COASTAL STATE TO ADOPT LAWS AND </p><p>REGULATIONS, IN CONFORMITY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE </p><p>CONVENTION AND OTHER RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, RELATING </p><p> </p><p>TO INNOCENT PASSAGE THROUGH THE TERRITORIAL SEA IN RESPECT </p><p>OF "MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS". </p><p>ARTICLE 40, ENTITLED "RESEARCH AND SURVEY ACTIVITIES," </p><p>PROVIDES THAT IN TRANSIT PASSAGE THROUGH STRAITS USED FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL NAVIGATION, FOREIGN SHIPS, INCLUDING "MARINE </p><p>SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY SHIPS", MAY </p><p>NOT CARRY OUT "ANY RESEARCH OR SURVEY ACTIVITIES" WITHOUT </p><p>THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OF THE STATES BORDERING STRAITS. </p><p>THE SAME RULE APPLIES TO SHIPS ENGAGED IN ARCHIPELAGIC SEA </p><p>LANES PASSAGE (ARTICLE 54). </p><p> </p><p>ON THE OTHER HAND, PART XIII OF THE LOS CONVENTION FULLY </p><p>REGULATES MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH; IT DOES NOT REFER TO </p><p>SURVEY ACTIVITIES AT ALL.  ARTICLE 246 OF THE LOS </p><p>CONVENTION PROVIDES THAT COASTAL STATES, IN THE EXERCISE </p><p>OF THEIR JURISDICTION WITHIN THE EEZ, HAVE THE RIGHT TO </p><p>REGULATE, AUTHORIZE AND CONDUCT MSR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE </p><p>RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE CONVENTION.  IT SPECIFIES THAT </p><p>MSR IN THE EEZ SHALL BE CONDUCTED WITH THE CONSENT OF THE </p><p>COASTAL STATE.  SWEDEN HAS SO PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 9 OF </p><p>LAW SFS 1992:1140. </p><p> </p><p>AND WHILE THE CONVENTION, BY ITS TERMS, LIMITS SURVEY </p><p>ACTIVITIES DURING PASSAGE IN THE TERRITORIAL SEA, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL STRAITS AND ARCHIPELAGIC SEA LANES, THE </p><p>CONVENTION DOES NOT LIMIT THE ACTIVITIES OF SURVEY SHIPS </p><p>IN THE EEZ.  RATHER, THE CONDUCT OF SURVEYS IN THE EEZ IS </p><p>AN EXERCISE OF THE FREEDOMS OF NAVIGATION AND OTHER </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY LAWFUL USES OF THE SEA RELATED TO THOSE </p><p>FREEDOMS, SUCH AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATIONS OF </p><p>SHIPS, WHICH ARTICLE 58 OF THE LOS CONVENTION GUARANTEES </p><p>TO ALL STATES. </p><p> </p><p>INDEED, SWEDEN HAS RECOGNIZED THIS RIGHT IN PARAGRAPH 10 </p><p>OF LAW SFS 1992:1140, WHICH IN ENGLISH TRANSLATION READS </p><p>"THIS LAW, AS WELL AS THE PROVISIONS AND CONDITIONS WHICH </p><p>ARE TRANSMITTED IN SUPPORT OF THE LAW. SHALL NOT CONTAIN </p><p>ANY RESTRICTION OF THE EXISTING RIGHTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW FOR FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION IN THE </p><p>EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE, FOR OVERFLIGHT OF THE ZONE, OR </p><p>FOR PLACEMENT OF CABLES AND PIPELINES IN THE ZONE, OR FOR </p><p>ANY OTHER RIGHTS WHICH ARE COMMONLY ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW." </p><p> </p><p>THIS CONCLUSION, THAT MSR IS DISTINCT FROM SURVEY </p><p>ACTIVITIES, IS SUPPORTED BY OTHER RESPECTED PUBLICATIONS </p><p>ON THIS SUBJECT.   FOR EXAMPLE, A 1991 PUBLICATION </p><p>PREPARED BY THE UN OFFICE FOR OCEAN AFFAIRS AND THE LAW OF </p><p> </p><p>THE SEA, ENTITLED "THE LAW OF THE SEA: MARINE SCIENTIFIC </p><p>RESEARCH: A GUIDE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RELEVANT </p><p>PROVISIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF </p><p>THE SEA" (UN PUBLICATION SALES NO. E.91.V.3), NOTES THAT </p><p>"\'SURVEY ACTIVITIES\' ... ARE PRIMARILY DEALT WITH IN OTHER </p><p>PARTS ... OF THE CONVENTION RATHER THAN IN PART XIII. </p><p>THIS COULD INDICATE THAT THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT FALL </p><p>UNDER THE REGIME OF PART XIII." (PAGE 1). </p><p> </p><p>PROFESSOR ALFRED H.A. SOONS, DIRECTOR OF THE NETHERLANDS </p><p>INSTITUTE FOR THE LAW OF THE SEA, IN HIS BOOK "MARINE </p><p>SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THE LAW OF THE SEA" (1982), HAS </p><p>WRITTEN: "FROM ARTICLES 19, 21 AND 40, WHICH USE THE TERM </p><p>\'HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING\' SEPARATELY FROM \'RESEARCH\', IT </p><p>FOLLOWS THAT THE TERM "MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\'. FOR </p><p>THE PURPOSES OF THE DRAFT CONVENTION, DOES NOT COVER </p><p>HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING ACTIVITIES." (PAGE 125)  LATER IN </p><p>THE SAME BOOK, PROFESSOR SOONS WROTE:  "WITH RESPECT TO </p><p>HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING (AN ACTIVITY WHICH IS NOT TO BE </p><p>CONSIDERED MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, ALTHOUGH IT IS </p><p>SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO IT ...), IT IS SUBMITTED THAT THIS </p><p>ACTIVITY, WHEN IT IS CONDUCTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF </p><p>ENHANCING THE SAFETY OF NAVIGATION ... , MUST BE REGARDED </p><p>AS AN INTERNATIONALLY LAWFUL USE OF THE SEA ASSOCIATED </p><p>WITH THE OPERATIONS OF SHIPS ... IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>ARTICLE 58, AND CAN THEREFORE BE CONDUCTED FREELY IN THE </p><p>EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE....." (PAGE 157) </p><p> </p><p>DEFINITIONS </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>THE LOS CONVENTION DOES NOT DEFINE THE TERMS "MARINE </p><p>SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH", "SURVEY ACTIVITIES", "HYDROGRAPHIC </p><p>SURVEY", OR "MILITARY SURVEY".  HOWEVER, THE CONCEPTS ARE </p><p>DISTINCT. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES ACCEPTS THAT "MARINE SCIENTIFIC </p><p>RESEARCH" IS THE GENERAL TERM MOST OFTEN USED TO DESCRIBE </p><p>THOSE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN IN THE OCEAN AND COASTAL </p><p>WATERS TO EXPAND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE MARINE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT.  MSR INCLUDES OCEANOGRAPHY, MARINE BIOLOGY, </p><p>FISHERIES RESEARCH, SCIENTIFIC OCEAN DRILLING AND CORING, </p><p>GEOLOGICAL/GEOPHYSICAL SCIENTIFIC SURVEYING, AS WELL AS </p><p>OTHER ACTIVITIES WITH A SCIENTIFIC PURPOSE. </p><p> </p><p>THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED MODERN INTERNATIONAL INTERPRETATION </p><p>OF "HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY", WHICH IS SHARED BY THE UNITED </p><p>STATES, IS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FOR THE MAKING OF </p><p> </p><p>NAVIGATIONAL CHARTS AND SAFETY OF NAVIGATION.  IT INCLUDES </p><p>DETERMINATION OF ONE OR MORE OF SEVERAL CLASSES OF DATA IN </p><p>COASTAL OR RELATIVELY SHALLOW AREAS--DEPTH OF WATER, </p><p>CONFIGURATION AND NATURE OF THE NATURAL BOTTOM, DIRECTIONS </p><p>AND FORCE OF CURRENTS, HEIGHTS AND TIMES OF TIDES AND </p><p>WATER STAGES, AND HAZARDS FOR NAVIGATION--FOR THE </p><p>PRODUCTION OF NAUTICAL CHARTS AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS TO </p><p>SUPPORT SAFETY OF NAVIGATION. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERS THAT MILITARY SURVEYS REFER TO </p><p>ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN IN THE OCEAN AND COASTAL WATERS </p><p>INVOLVING MARINE DATA COLLECTION (WHETHER OR NOT </p><p>CLASSIFIED) FOR MILITARY PURPOSES.  MILITARY SURVEYS CAN </p><p>INCLUDE OCEANOGRAPHIC, MARINE GEOLOGICAL, GEOPHYSICAL, </p><p>CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND ACOUSTIC DATA.  EQUIPMENT USED </p><p>CAN INCLUDE FATHOMETERS, SWATH BOTTOM MAPPERS, SIDE SCAN </p><p>SONARS, BOTTOM GRAB AND CORING SYSTEMS, CURRENT METERS AND </p><p>PROFILERS.  WHILE THE MEANS OF DATA COLLECTION USED IN </p><p>MILITARY SURVEYS MAY SOMETIMES BE THE SAME AS THAT USED IN </p><p>MSR, INFORMATION FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES, REGARDLESS OF </p><p>SECURITY CLASSIFICATION, IS INTENDED NOT FOR USE BY THE </p><p>GENERAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, BUT BY THE MILITARY. </p><p> </p><p>MILITARY SURVEYS ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE LOS </p><p>CONVENTION AND THERE IS NO LANGUAGE STATING OR IMPLYING </p><p>THAT MILITARY SURVEYS MAY BE REGULATED IN ANY MANNER BY </p><p>COASTAL STATES OUTSIDE THEIR TERRITORIAL SEA OR </p><p>ARCHIPELAGIC WATERS.  THE UNITED STATES THEREFORE </p><p>CONSIDERS IT TO BE FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE LOS </p><p>CONVENTION THAT SUCH SURVEYS ARE A HIGH SEAS FREEDOM AND </p><p>THE UNITED STATES RESERVES THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN MILITARY </p><p>SURVEYS ANYWHERE OUTSIDE FOREIGN TERRITORIAL SEAS AND </p><p>ARCHIPELAGIC WATERS.  TO PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE OR REQUEST </p><p>PERMISSION WOULD CREATE AN ADVERSE PRECEDENT FOR </p><p>RESTRICTIONS ON MOBILITY AND FLEXIBILITY OF MILITARY </p><p>SURVEY OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THESE DEFINITIONS CLEARLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN MSR, WHICH </p><p>THE COASTAL STATE CAN REGULATE, AND HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY </p><p>AND MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE FREEDOMS THE </p><p>COASTAL STATE CANNOT REGULATE OUTSIDE ITS TERRITORIAL SEA. </p><p> </p><p>MILITARY ACTIVITIES </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTION AS TO THE CONDUCT OF "MILITARY </p><p>ACTIVITIES" IN THE EEZ WITHOUT COASTAL STATE CONSENT.  IN </p><p>THE VIEW OF THE UNITED STATES, THE LOS CONVENTION </p><p>RECOGNIZES THAT ALL STATES HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT </p><p>MILITARY ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE EEZ, PROVIDED THAT THEY DO </p><p>SO WITH DUE REGARD TO THE RIGHTS OF THE COASTAL STATE AND </p><p>OTHER STATES.  APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE LAUNCHING </p><p>AND LANDING OF AIRCRAFT, OPERATING MILITARY DEVICES, </p><p>INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION, WEAPONS EXERCISES, AND MILITARY </p><p>SURVEYS.  THERE IS NO GENERAL COMPETENCE OF THE COASTAL </p><p>STATE OVER MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN THE EEZ.  IT FOLLOWS </p><p>THAT MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED OUTSIDE FOREIGN </p><p>TERRITORIAL SEAS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COASTAL STATE </p><p>REGULATION.  SEE ARTICLE 56 OF THE LOS CONVENTION AND </p><p>OXMAN, THE REGIME OF WARSHIPS UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA, VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW, VOL. 24, AT PAGE 847 (1984). </p><p> </p><p>U.S. MILITARY SURVEY VESSELS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE USNS KANE IS ONE OF A CLASS OF U.S. NAVAL AUXILIARY </p><p>VESSELS (T-AGS) DESIGNED FOR AND OPERATING AS MILITARY </p><p>SURVEY VESSELS.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT EXERCISES OUR HIGH </p><p>SEAS FREEDOMS WITH RESPECT TO MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITY IN </p><p>THE EEZ OF COASTAL STATES WORLDWIDE CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW AS REFLECTED IN THIS PAPER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHRISTOPHER </p><p></p></div>
