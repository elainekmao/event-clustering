(SBU) Summary:  Zimbabwe\'s free-falling economy has </p><p>taken a turn for the worse.  Fuel, electricity and even </p><p>bank notes are becoming scarcer.  Business leaders who </p><p>laid hopes on the GOZ\'s economic reform process a few </p><p>months ago are increasingly joining the Movement for </p><p>Democratic Change (MDC)\'s call for a "final push."  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>De-Industrialization Continues </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>2. (SBU) Incredible as it sounds, Harare\'s fuel lines </p><p>have grown longer, often reaching 4 kilometers.  In many </p><p>rural areas, motorized transport is dying out, leaving </p><p>Zimbabweans to hike as far as 30 kilometers for food </p><p>purchases or donations.  There are workers whose monthly </p><p>salary will not cover a single disposable razor from </p><p>South Africa.  The Reserve Bank lacks funds for imported </p><p>ink and paper to print new bank notes.  Several banks </p><p>have stopped servicing cash withdrawals.  Others are </p><p>limiting withdrawals to US$ 35 or stacks of Z$ 50 notes </p><p>(worth about 2 U.S. cents each/bring a shopping cart). </p><p>Even parastatal Air Zimbabwe is toying with no longer </p><p>accepting newly-worthless Zimdollars. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Other than the export and financial sectors, </p><p>which are still above-water, the business community is in </p><p>deep despair.  Even the GOZ\'s relaxing of most price </p><p>controls last week failed to inspire optimism. </p><p>Businessmen cite the GOZ\'s corruption, botched </p><p>normalization of fuel prices and inability to rescue an </p><p>imploding infrastructure.  (The </p><p>Transportation/Communications PermSec told us most of the </p><p>National Railway of Zimbabwe\'s locomotives are sidelined </p><p>due to lack of spare parts.)  Business reps now consider </p><p>the GOZ incapable of guiding economic reform and are </p><p>gradually joining the MDC\'s calls for a "final push" that </p><p>would end Robert Mugabe\'s 23-year rule. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) This seems to represent a sea change in business </p><p>attitudes over the past months.  The latest 65 percent </p><p>devaluation of the Zimdollar was a painful blow for many, </p><p>who have now abandoned hope that the GOZ can liberalize </p><p>economics but ignore politics.  While they would not </p><p>welcome additional 2-3 day stayaways, businessmen seem </p><p>willing to swallow even an indefinite stayaway if it ends </p><p>this ordeal. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
