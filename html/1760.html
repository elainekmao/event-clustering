PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF BULGARIA\'S JUNE 17 ELECTIONS </p><p>SHOW A COMMANDING LEAD FOR THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT SIMEON </p><p>II, WITH AN OUTRIGHT MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT SEEMINGLY </p><p>LIKELY BUT NOT YET ASSURED.  THE UDF OF PM KOSTOV HAS </p><p>SUFFERED A SERIOUS DEFEAT, AND HE IS EXPECTED TO RESIGN </p><p>AS PARTY LEADER SHORTLY.  THE SOCIALISTS AND THE ETHNIC </p><p>TURKISH MRF DID SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN EXPECTED.  A FIFTH </p><p>POLITICAL GROUPING, GERGYOVDEN-VMRO, FELL JUST SHORT OF </p><p>THE NECESSARY FOUR PERCENT OF THE VOTE TO ENTER </p><p>PARLIAMENT, BUT MAY REQUEST A RECOUNT.  FINAL RESULTS </p><p>ARE EXPECTED ON JUNE 20, BUT TALK OF POSSIBLE </p><p>COALITIONS HAS ALREADY BEGUN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>PRELIMINARY RESULTS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  WITH OVER 99 PERCENT OF PRECINCTS REPORTING, THE </p><p>NATIONAL MOVEMENT SIMEON II (NMS2), POLITICAL VEHICLE </p><p>OF THE FORMER TSAR, HAS A COMMANDING LEAD IN ELECTIONS </p><p>TO BULGARIA\'S 240-SEAT UNICAMERAL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. </p><p>BALLOTS CAST ABROAD HAVE NOT YET BEEN COUNTED AND </p><p>OFFICIAL RESULTS ARE NOT EXPECTED UNTIL WEDNESDAY, JUNE </p><p>20, BUT IF THESE NUMBERS HOLD UP, NMS2 WILL PROBABLY </p><p>HAVE AN OUTRIGHT MAJORITY (SUBJECT TO THE VAGARIES OF </p><p>BULGARIA\'S 31-DISTRICT PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION </p><p>SYSTEM). </p><p> </p><p>3.  PRELIMINARY RESULTS ANNOUNCED BY THE CENTRAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        SOFIA  03033  01 OF 03  180953Z </p><p>ELECTION COMMISSION EARLY ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 18 ARE </p><p>AS FOLLOWS (A PARTY OR COALITION MUST RECEIVE 4 PERCENT </p><p>OF THE VOTE NATIONWIDE TO ENTER PARLIAMENT): </p><p> </p><p>PARTY       PCT.

BASED ON THESE FIGURES, FOUR COALITIONS ARE CERTAIN </p><p>TO ENTER THE NEW PARLIAMENT:  NMS2; THE UNITED </p><p>DEMOCRATIC FORCES (UTDDF) LED BY OUTGOING PM IVAN </p><p>KOSTOV\'S UNION OF DEMOCRATIC FORCES (UDF); THE </p><p>COALITION FOR BULGARIA LED BY THE BULGARIAN SOCIALIST </p><p>PARTY (BSP); AND THE MRF-LIBERAL-EUROROMA COALITION LED </p><p>BY THE PREDOMINANTLY ETHNIC-TURKISH MOVEMENT FOR RIGHTS </p><p>AND FREEDOMS (MRF).  THE FATE OF THE FIFTH COALITION, </p><p>GERGYOVDEN-VMRO, AND WITH IT A POSSIBLE NMS2 OUTRIGHT </p><p>MAJORITY, HANGS IN THE BALANCE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  THE NMS2 VICTORY WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN </p><p>MORE RESOUNDING WERE IT NOT FOR VOTER CONFUSION.  TWO </p><p>FRINGE COALITIONS UNAFFILIATED WITH THE TSAR ADDED THE </p><p>WORDS "SIMEON II" TO THEIR NAMES, AND MANAGED TO GRAB </p><p>MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE VOTE BETWEEN THEM (ONE CAME </p><p>WITHIN HALF A PERCENT OF ENTERING PARLIAMENT!).  IN </p><p>OTHER WORDS, ALMOST 50 PERCENT OF VOTERS TRIED TO CAST </p><p>THEIR BALLOTS FOR SIMEON.  END COMMENT. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        SOFIA  03033  01 OF 03  180953Z </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>VOTING FREE AND FAIR AT HOME, PROBLEMATIC ABROAD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE OSCE ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSION WILL HOLD A </p><p>PRESS CONFERENCE LATER TODAY (JUNE 18).  BASED ON MEDIA </p><p>ACCOUNTS AND THE REPORTS OF EMBASSY PERSONNEL WHO </p><p>PARTICIPATED IN THE OBSERVATION EFFORT, THERE WERE NO </p><p>SERIOUS IRREGULARITIES IN BULGARIA ITSELF.  COMPLAINTS </p><p>HAVE BEEN MADE, HOWEVER, ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THE </p><p>ELECTION ABROAD.  THESE CONCERN MAINLY A LACK OF </p><p>ORGANIZATION AND INSUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF BALLOT </p><p>PAPERS AT POLLING PLACES IN TURKEY, SPAIN, GERMANY AND </p><p>ELSEWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>HARD LOSS FOR THE UDF </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE UDF DID SOMEWHAT WORSE THAN EXPECTED, AND CAME </p><p>PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO FALLING PAST THE BSP INTO THIRD </p><p>PLACE OVERALL.  NMS2 BEAT UDF IN EVERY REGION, </p><p>INCLUDING THE PARTY\'S TRADITIONAL STRONGHOLDS SOFIA AND </p><p>PLOVDIV.

KOSTOV CONCEDED DEFEAT AND IS EXPECTED TO TENDER </p><p>HIS RESIGNATION AS PARTY LEADER SHORTLY, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>MAY WELL STAND FOR THAT POST AGAIN.  IN CONGRATULATING </p><p>SIMEON, KOSTOV SAID HE EXPECTS NMS2 TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT NECESSARY BUT PAINFUL REFORMS INITIATED BY </p><p>HIS ADMINISTRATION.  BECAUSE OF THESE REFORMS, KOSTOV </p><p>CONCLUDED, THE UDF LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF VOTERS BUT </p><p>BULGARIA WON THE CONFIDENCE OF THE WORLD:  "WE BUILT AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION, AND A GOOD BASIS FOR EUROPEAN </p><p>AND EURO-ATLANTIC INTEGRATION." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>MRF BOUNCES BACK; GERGYOVDEN-VMRO IN LIMBO </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE MAINLY ETHNIC TURKISH MRF BOUNCED BACK STRONGLY </p><p>IN THE LATTER STAGES OF THE CAMPAIGN, AND DID BETTER </p><p>THAN MOST POLLSTERS HAD EXPECTED.  IN FACT, THE MRF WAS </p><p>THE ONLY PARTY TO DO BETTER THAN NMS2 IN ANY REGION: </p><p>IT WON A MAJORITY IN KURDZHALI AND A PLURALITY IN </p><p>RAZGRAD, BOTH DISTRICTS WITH LARGE ETHNIC TURKISH </p><p>POPULATIONS AND IN WHICH NMS2 DID NOT CAMPAIGN </p><p>ACTIVELY.  IT APPEARS THERE WAS VERY HEAVY VOTING IN </p><p>TURKEY AS WELL, WITH PEOPLE STANDING IN LINE AS LONG AS </p><p>SIX HOURS AT POLLING STATIONS IN ISTANBUL AND </p><p>ELSEWHERE, ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  PENDING THE RELEASE OF FINAL RESULTS, THE </p><p>COALITION OF TWO MILDLY NATIONALIST FORMATIONS -- THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        SOFIA  03033  02 OF 03  180954Z </p><p>GERGYOVDEN MOVEMENT AND THE INTERNAL MACEDONIAN </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION (VMRO) -- REMAINS IN LIMBO. </p><p>EARLY RETURNS SHOWED THEM ABOVE THE FOUR PERCENT </p><p>THRESHOLD FOR ENTRY TO PARLIAMENT, BUT BY EARLY MONDAY </p><p>MORNING IT APPEARED THEY HAD FALLEN OUT OF CONTENTION. </p><p>GERGYOVDEN LEADER LYUBEN DILOV JR. SUGGESTED HE MIGHT </p><p>DEMAND A HAND RECOUNT.  IF THE RESULTS STAND AND </p><p>GERGYOVDEN-VMRO DOES NOT GET INTO PARLIAMENT, AN </p><p>OUTRIGHT MAJORITY FOR NMS2 APPEARS LIKELY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  COMMENT:  THE MRF, FOR ITS PART, CLAWED ITS WAY </p><p>BACK FROM THE EDGE OF POLITICAL OBLIVION, AND PARTY </p><p>LEADER AHMED DOGAN MUST BE BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF </p><p>AND RELISHING THE PROSPECT OF THUMBING HIS NOSE AT </p><p>KOSTOV FROM A LIKELY POSITION INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>GERGYOVDEN-VMRO, MEANWHILE, IF IT FAILS TO REACH FOUR </p><p>PERCENT, WILL PROBABLY SPLIT INTO ITS CONSTITUENT </p><p>PARTS.  VMRO -- WITH A LONG HISTORY, COHERENT IDEOLOGY </p><p>AND REPRESENTATION ON SEVERAL MUNICIPAL COUNCILS -- </p><p>WILL PROBABLY SOLDIER ON AT THE FRINGES OF POWER. </p><p>GERGYOVDEN -- A MUCH LOOSER FORMATION THAT COUNTED ON </p><p>THE PROTEST VOTE SUBSEQUENTLY VACUUMED UP BY SIMEON -- </p><p>IS MORE LIKELY TO FADE SLOWLY AWAY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>WHAT HAPPENS NOW? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  UNDER THE BULGARIAN CONSTITUTION, THE NEW </p><p>PARLIAMENT MUST ASSEMBLE WITHIN ONE MONTH.

THE NMS2 </p><p>LEADER IN PLOVDIV AND POSSIBLE FUTURE FINANCE MINISTER </p><p>MILEN VELCHEV SAID NMS2 WILL SEEK A BROAD COALITION </p><p>WITH PARTIES THAT CAN SUPPORT THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS </p><p>OF THE TSAR\'S PROGRAM (REF A), BUT WILL NOT WORK WITH </p><p>"CORRUPT OR DISCREDITED" INDIVIDUALS.  HE AND OTHER </p><p>NMS2 REPRESENTATIVES STRESSED THAT THE NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p>WILL PURSUE CONTINUITY IN FOREIGN POLICY, PARTICULARLY </p><p>AS REGARDS MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU AND NATO AND STABILITY </p><p>IN THE BALKANS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  SERIOUS COALITION NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNLIKELY UNTIL </p><p>FINAL ELECTION RESULTS ARE ANNOUNCED, PROBABLY ON JUNE </p><p>20.  IN THE MEANTIME, HOWEVER, FEELERS ARE ALREADY OUT. </p><p>JUST DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, KOSTOV DECLARED THAT HE </p><p>WOULD NOT ACCEPT A COALITION WITH NMS2.  AS THE RESULTS </p><p>CAME IN SUNDAY NIGHT, HOWEVER, OTHER PARTY LEADERS LEFT </p><p>THE DOOR OPEN.  UDF GENERAL SECRETARY EKATERINA </p><p>MIKHAILOVA SAID THE UDF IS WILLING TO TALK ABOUT A </p><p>COALITION WITH THE NMS2 IF THE LATTER INITIATES THE </p><p>DISCUSSION, AND PROVIDED THAT SUCH A COALITION DOES NOT </p><p>INCLUDE THE BSP.

WITH RESULTS STILL UNOFFICIAL AND A TSARIST </p><p>MAJORITY NOT YET CERTAIN, THE ONLY THING THAT CAN BE </p><p>SAFELY SAID ABOUT THE NEXT BULGARIAN GOVERNMENT IS THAT </p><p>IT WILL BE DOMINATED BY THE NMS2.  REFTELS ADDRESS THE </p><p>STATED PRIORITIES OF THE MOVEMENT (FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>CONTINUITY, ACCELERATED ECONOMIC REFORM AND MORE </p><p>ATTENTION TO SOCIAL NEEDS) AND THE DIFFICULTIES IT IS </p><p>LIKELY TO FACE IN PURSUING THEM.  AS NOTED IN REF B, </p><p>AND REITERATED BY NMS2 REPRESENTATIVES AS THE RESULTS </p><p>CAME IN, THERE ARE NO PLANS TO SEEK A RESTORATION OF </p><p>THE MONARCHY (AT LEAST FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE). </p><p> </p><p>15.  AS FOR THE OTHER PARTIES, THEY MUST LICK THEIR </p><p>WOUNDS AND AWAIT A CALL FROM SIMEON.  THIS WAS A </p><p>HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR THE UDF, AND KOSTOV IS ALL BUT </p><p>CERTAIN TO OFFER HIS RESIGNATION, BUT HIS RETURN TO THE </p><p>HELM OF THE PARTY CANNOT BE RULED OUT.  MUCH MAY DEPEND </p><p>ON HOW MUCH NMS2 WOULD BE PREPARED TO OFFER THE UDF TO </p><p>BRING IT INTO A NEW GOVERNMENT (OR AT LEAST SECURE ITS </p><p>SUPPORT ON KEY ITEMS OF SIMEON\'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA). </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE SOCIALISTS DID SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN EXPECTED, </p><p>WHICH SHOULD BOLSTER THE POSITION OF THEIR REFORMIST </p><p>CHAIRMAN GEORGI PURVANOV.  BUT THEY REMAINED BEHIND THE </p><p>UDF, THE PARTY\'S UNRECONSTRUCTED LEFT IS ALREADY </p><p>CALLING FOR PURVANOV\'S HEAD, AND THE PARTY COULD SPLIT. </p><p>STILL, FEW IN THE BSP EXPECTED TO WIN THE ELECTION, AND </p><p>THEY CAN TAKE SOLACE IN THE FACT THAT SIMEON ACHIEVED </p><p>THEIR MAIN OBJECTIVE FOR THEM:  REMOVING KOSTOV AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        SOFIA  03033  03 OF 03  180954Z </p><p>COMPANY FROM POWER.  WHILE AN NMS2-BSP COALITION IS </p><p>UNLIKELY, THE SOCIALISTS MAY STILL FIND COMMON GROUND </p><p>WITH SIMEON ON ISSUES SUCH AS WAGE AND PENSION </p><p>INCREASES, WHILE WORKING TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES AS THE </p><p>MOST CREDIBLE OPPOSITION PARTY.  (IN THAT CONNECTION, A </p><p>SECONDARY RESULT OF THESE ELECTIONS IS THAT THE BSP </p><p>FINDS ITSELF, FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST, WITH NO SERIOUS </p><p>COMPETITION ON THE POLITICAL LEFT:  THE BULGARIAN EURO- </p><p>LEFT PARTY, WHICH HAD HOPED TO EMERGE AS A SOCIAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC ALTERNATIVE TO THE BSP, GOT JUST ONE PERCENT </p><p>AND ITS LEADER, ALEXANDER TOMOV, PROMPTLY RESIGNED). </p><p> </p><p>MILES </p><p></p></div>
