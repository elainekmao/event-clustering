<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0137 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE AND NEA/NGA AND PRM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SE TURKEY HOPES FOR ECONOMIC TURNAROUND </p><p>FOLLOWING COALITION VICTORY IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This cable is sensitive but unclassified; please </p><p>protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary: Prominent Adana and Mersin </p><p>businessmen are optimistic for increased </p><p>economic opportunities relating to the </p><p>Coalition victory in Operation Iraqi Freedom. </p><p>They also are hoping to take advantage of the </p><p>SARS outbreak to export more textiles to </p><p>Europe.  While they believe there may be </p><p>openings in Iraq for Turkish companies and that </p><p>trade will soon resume with Iraq, they caution </p><p>that without significant steps by the GOT and </p><p>strong relations with the United States, Turkey </p><p>"has no chance" to improve its economic </p><p>situation.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Hopeful for business alliances with Iraq </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Prior to the beginning of Operation </p><p>Iraqi Freedom, southeastern Turkish businesses </p><p>were proving to be stagnant as the uncertainty </p><p>of the war, and its effects, loomed. </p><p>Businesses, mainly exporters, were finding </p><p>their international clients looking for </p><p>alternate suppliers in case Turkish companies </p><p>could not fulfill their orders.  However, </p><p>according to local business owners, while </p><p>Turkey remains in a deep economic crisis, the </p><p>war did not produce any direct negative </p><p>economic ramifications.  Rather, the </p><p>Coalition\'s victory in Iraq has the potential </p><p>to open many economic opportunities for Turkey; </p><p>"Iraq can, in the long term, buy services and </p><p>products from Turkey using its oil revenue." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) However, according to our contacts, the </p><p>re-establishment of Iraq as a major trading </p><p>partner depends upon the United States\' </p><p>willingness to encourage the new Iraqi </p><p>government to work with the Turks.  The failure </p><p>of Turkey to play a significant role in the war </p><p>may have denied Turkey an opportunity to </p><p>quickly improve its economic situation with </p><p>contracts in post-war Iraq and with the US </p><p>economic package.  Nonetheless, according to </p><p>some sources, the failure of the February 2003 </p><p>motion to allow US troops in Turkey did provide </p><p>two abstract economic benefits: (1) problems </p><p>with Turkey\'s neighbors who did not support the </p><p>Coalition did not materialize allowing Turkey </p><p>the opportunity to maintain, perhaps even </p><p>strengthen, these relationships; and (2) money </p><p>that would have been received from the USA </p><p>would have gone directly to the politicians and </p><p>not to the businesses and people who most need </p><p>it requiring the Turkish private sector to </p><p>continue to work hard to overcome the current </p><p>economic crisis.  Whether or not these </p><p>intangible "benefits" are true, many of our </p><p>contacts fear the strains caused by the </p><p>motion\'s failure in the US-Turkish relationship </p><p>will cause the US to `overlook\' Turkey in post- </p><p>war Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Blaming the USG and GOT for a Weak Turkish </p><p>Economy </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Some of our contacts expressed strong </p><p>anger towards the United States for </p><p>"sidelining" Turkey economically.  According to </p><p>these sources, the US\'s failure to lift all </p><p>textile quotas for Turkey, the US\'s </p><p>unwillingness to permit Turkey to play a vital </p><p>role in the reconstruction of Iraq, and the </p><p>US\'s failure to "live up to its promises" after </p><p>the end of the first Gulf War, produced a </p><p>strain on the US-Turkey relationship.  "Now, as </p><p>the GOT does everything it can to relieve </p><p>Turkey of its economic problems, the US, our </p><p>supposed ally, does not show her support (i.e., </p><p>in the form of waived quotas, guaranteed </p><p>contracts, et al)." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) "While it is easy to blame the </p><p>Americans," most businessmen believe Turkey\'s </p><p>current economic situation can only be resolved </p><p>if the GOT takes meaningful steps to streamline </p><p>its costs and improve the financial climate in </p><p>Turkey.  "Many Turks are frustrated because </p><p>while Turkey has the resources, people, and </p><p>knowledge it takes to improve the country, the </p><p>government has consistently failed to do so." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) According to our sources, four tasks must </p><p>be achieved by GOT to put Turkey on the road to </p><p>economic recovery: privatization, population </p><p>control, smaller government and streamlined </p><p>government spending, and improved foreign </p><p>investment policies.  Our contacts have </p><p>consistently stated that privatization would </p><p>allow for redundant governmental positions to </p><p>be eliminated and streamlined programs to be </p><p>implemented.  Population control, especially a </p><p>problem in the Southeast where low education </p><p>and high birth rates abound, could be achieved </p><p>with targeted education campaigns.   A more </p><p>manageable population would, in turn, produce </p><p>less strain on already strained governmental </p><p>programs.  Frustrated businessmen argue current </p><p>government practices to continue hiring people </p><p>in an effort to slow unemployment have created </p><p>false statistics and excessive government </p><p>spending.  Finally, prevailing GOT foreign </p><p>investment policies must be improved to reflect </p><p>willingness and desire to have foreign </p><p>investors in Turkey.  Currently bureaucratic </p><p>procedures involved in investing and </p><p>establishing foreign companies in Turkey </p><p>strongly deters would-be investors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>SARS: An Interesting Side Note </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  Our contacts also believe the SARS </p><p>outbreak will drive more contracts to Turkey as </p><p>people begin to turn away from the Far East in </p><p>fear of the disease.  According to Free Zone </p><p>leaders, while many Turkish businessmen have </p><p>sought out these types of contracts, many </p><p>textile contracts have sought out Turkey as a </p><p>future supplier. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
