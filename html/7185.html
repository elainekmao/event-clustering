<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000678 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/01/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, EFIN, PINR, YM, ECON/COM </p><p>SUBJECT: PROMINENT OPPOSITION BUSINESSMAN\'S VIEWS ON ROYG </p><p>ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by CDA Alan G. Misenheimer for </p><p>reasons 1.5 B. and D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: A prominent businessman believes civil </p><p>service reform is the most important change that the Yemeni </p><p>government must make to stem corruption.  According to Islah </p><p>party member and leading banking figure Mahfoodh Salem </p><p>Shammakh, attempts by the government, World Bank and other </p><p>lending agencies to reform the civil service have yet to </p><p>force the ROYG to take tough decisions such as laying off </p><p>workers and raising salaries. Shammakh also offered his views </p><p>on Yemeni education and the effects of qat on the economy. </p><p>End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Mahfoodh Salem Shammakh, Director of Shammakh and </p><p>Company, cofounder of the Yemeni Commercial Bank, and </p><p>prominent Islah Party moderate, outlined his ideas for </p><p>reforming the Yemeni economy, including civil service reform, </p><p>education overhaul, and land use reform. Shammakh is from </p><p>Hadrawmaut, educated in Aden and a member of several economic </p><p>committees, including the Ministry of Industry and Trade\'s </p><p>World Trade Organization accession advisory committee and the </p><p>Sanaa Chamber of Commerce. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Laws Help, but Civil Service Reform is Real Solution </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Shammakh supported passage of the anti-money </p><p>laundering law by the Yemeni parliament, while acknowledging </p><p>that his own accounting procedures may become more </p><p>complicated. Shammakh explained that his sugar business </p><p>suffered when a Lebanese merchant sold sugar in Yemen at </p><p>below market price, but accounted for the sugar at the </p><p>regular price, effectively laundering his money and harming </p><p>Shammakh\'s own sugar sales. Shammakh said acts like this may </p><p>be curtailed by the law, and his businesses may do better. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Shammakh concluded saying, "the law will never be </p><p>implemented." Shammakh contended that tribes make too much </p><p>money smuggling drugs and antiquities to allow for effective </p><p>implementation.  He claimed that many of the tribes were </p><p>smuggling Jewish texts out of the country, and in one </p><p>instance a dealer in Singapore was willing to pay 15 million </p><p>USD (sic) for a piece of ancient Hebrew scripture.  For the </p><p>tribes, this was too much money to forego and after a few </p><p>attempts to enforce the law, the government, he believes, </p><p>will lose interest in enforcement. Corruption by individuals </p><p>in the government, he added, could be stopped, but civil </p><p>service reform was the only solution. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Citing his experience with corruption he said, "I\'m a </p><p>merchant, and I know what things cost. None of the Ministers </p><p>could afford my refrigerators on their salaries, but they all </p><p>have them."  Shammakh continued by detailing the financial </p><p>requirements of a high official, and concluded that there was </p><p>no way a senior official could even afford food on the salary </p><p>provided by the Ministry.  The first step for reform is to </p><p>trim the bloated ROYG workforce and the second step is to </p><p>adequately compensate the workers the ROYG is able to keep. </p><p>Admitting this may be a painful and long process, Shammakh </p><p>said it was the most important factor in ending corruption in </p><p>Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Ill-prepared Workers </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Turning to other problems of doing business in Yemen, </p><p>he said, "I cannot find a secretary to hire." Complaining </p><p>that the Yemeni education system focuses too much on </p><p>impractical knowledge and little on career based education, </p><p>he said he and his colleagues found it extremely difficult to </p><p>find qualified people.  He said to counter this, the Islah </p><p>Party founded the Islahi Technical College to train students </p><p>in computer and job skills. To his disappointment, the </p><p>college has since become a university focused on producing </p><p>engineers and has strayed from its original purpose of </p><p>teaching job skills appropriate for the labor market in </p><p>Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Qat: the "Evil of Evils" </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  Qat, Shammakh said, was "the evil of evils."  He </p><p>blamed many Yemeni economic problems on Qat and the inability </p><p>of the Ministry of Agriculture to encourage the growth of </p><p>alternative crops. He said farmers needed micro-enterprise </p><p>projects, and not long-term studies.  Qat was taking valuable </p><p>land and water that could be used for cash crops.  Shammakh </p><p>owns a tannery and said he was unable to get suitable hides </p><p>in Yemen because people kill their cows too young. Blaming </p><p>this also on qat, he said that people would rather grow qat </p><p>than use the land to graze cattle or grow coffee or ginseng, </p><p>all profitable commodities for Yemen.  Shammakh himself left </p><p>the coffee business because he was unable find land to grow </p><p>enough beans to make production profitable. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: Shammakh focused his strong critique of the </p><p>ROYG on the ministries themselves, and never once mentioned </p><p>the Presidency. We have been reliably told that that </p><p>President Saleh had asked Shammakh to join the ruling GPC, </p><p>but that Shammakh told the President that he needed to stay </p><p>in the Islah Party to keep it moderate.  Shammakh politely </p><p>answered all of Pol/Econoff\'s questions on money laundering, </p><p>but took every opportunity to provide his own views on what </p><p>ails the Yemeni economy. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
