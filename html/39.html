<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BEIRUT 01645 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  JA\'JA\'S MOVEMENT COMMUNIQUE </p><p> </p><p>1.  ON MARCH 14, SAMIR JA\'JA\'S FORCES, NOW </p><p>CALLED THE "CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT," </p><p>ISSUED THE FOLLOWING COMMUNIQUE OUTLINING THEIR </p><p>AIMS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>"THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF QUERIES LATELY ABOUT WHAT </p><p>EVER HAPPENED TO THE AUTONOMOUS DECISION OF THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY, ON WHETHER THIS COMMUNITY </p><p>HAD ACTUALLY LOST THE INITIATIVE, ON WHETHER </p><p>SUBSISTANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL UPHEAVAL EMBODIED </p><p>BY BASHIR GEMAYEL\'S POLICY HAS BEEN OVERSTEPPED </p><p>BY TIME AND ON WHETHER CHRISTIAN INSTITUTIONS </p><p>FOR CONSULTATION AND DECISION HAVE BEEN CRIPPLED </p><p>OR HAVE JUST FALLEN INTO DISUSE, THE STATEMENT </p><p>SAID. </p><p> </p><p>"IN ANY CASE, WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE? THE STATE- </p><p>MENT ADDED.  SOME SAY IT SHOULD BE THE POLITICAL </p><p>COMPROMISES UNDERWAY WHILE OTHERS SPEAK, AFTER </p><p>THE FALL OF INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES, OF </p><p>REGIONAL GUARANTEES INSTEAD.  WHATEVER THE </p><p>CASE MAY BE, ALL THESE MATTERS CAN BE DISCUSSED. </p><p>BUT WHAT IS CRYSTAL-CLEAR IS THAT THERE CAN </p><p>BE NO SOLID POLITICAL SOLUTION UNLESS COUPLED </p><p>WITH AN ADEQUATE BALANCE OF FORCES BEARING </p><p>CLEAR-OUT FEATURES AND AN UNEQUIVOCAL POLITICAL </p><p>STRATEGY TO GO ALONG WITH AN AUTONOMOUS DECISION </p><p>FREED FROM ALL TRUSTEESHIPS. </p><p> </p><p>"THE RESTORATION OF THE DECISION AND THE SOCIAL </p><p>CENTRALIZATION OF IT CAN, ALONE, PROVIDE THE </p><p>PROPER FRAME FOR ANY SERIOUS DISCUSSION LIKELY </p><p>TO LEAD US TO THE KIND OF PEACE ASPIRED TO, </p><p>FOR WE REJECT THE PEACE RESULTING FROM SUBMITTING </p><p>TO OTHER PEOPLE\'S WILL. </p><p> </p><p>"THE CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT HAS PROVIDED THE </p><p>ANSWER TO ALL THESE QUERIES.  THIS MOVEMENT </p><p>ACTUALLY CONSTITUTES THE ORGANIZED EXPRESSION </p><p>OF THE WILL OF THE BASE OF ALL CHRISTIAN IN- </p><p>STITUTIONS IN RECUPERATING THE DECISION AND THE </p><p>INITIATIVE, AND THERE CANNOT BE, FROM THIS DAY </p><p>FORWARD, NO RELIANCE BUT ON THE AUTONOMOUS </p><p>DECISION AND NO GUARANTEE BUT THROUGH POLICIES THAT </p><p>INCARNATE THIS DECISION. </p><p> </p><p>"FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, THE SECURITY OF THE </p><p>CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE DEPENDING ANYMORE </p><p>ON THE CHANGES OF INTERNATIONAL OR REGIONAL </p><p>POLICIES AND THERE WILL BE NO POLITICAL WILL </p><p>LINKED TO THE MOODS AND DISPOSITIONS THAT </p><p>GOVERN POLITICAL INTERCOURSE IN THIS TORMENTED </p><p>COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>"FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, THERE WILL BE NO </p><p>CHRISTIAN SOCIETY WITH A CRIPPLED WILL AND KEPT </p><p>DEPRIVED OF POLICYMAKING AT HOME AND ON THE </p><p>REGIONAL PLANE AS WELL, AND RULED BY VIOLENT </p><p>WARRING STRATEGIES. </p><p> </p><p>"THE BASIS FOR AN OBJECTIVE COOPERATION WITH </p><p>A REALITY OF THE KIND WE HAVE DEPICTED IS CLEAR </p><p>AND CAN BE DEFINED, IN BRIEF, AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>"EXTREMISM CANNOT BE DETERRED OTHERWISE THAN </p><p>BY STEADFASTNESS, AND HEGEMONY AND DISCRIMINATORY </p><p>PHENOMENA CANNOT BE HANDLED BUT THROUGH CLEAR </p><p>POLITICAL WILLS AND IDEAS AND ADEQUATE EXECUTIVE </p><p>INSTRUMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>"ONLY WHEN THE CHRISTIAN FREEDOM OF DECISION IS </p><p>RESTORED AND THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF IT </p><p>CLEARLY DEFINED CAN NEGOTIATION AND INTERCOURSE </p><p>WITH ALL SIDES BECOME POSSIBLE, ON THE HOME FRONT </p><p>AND ON THE REGIONAL LEVEL.  OTHERWISE, WE WOULD </p><p>BE ENGAGED INTO A DANGEROUS TURNING POINT LIKELY </p><p>TO WIPE OUT WHAT IS LEFT OF OUR ENERGIES, OUR </p><p>CREDIBILITY AND OUR EFFICIENCY. </p><p> </p><p>"THE CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT CONSIDERS THAT </p><p>THE SETTING UP OF NEW BASES FOR DEALINGS AND </p><p>DIALOGUE HAS BECOME AN INDISPENSIBLE PRE- </p><p>REQUISITE FOR LIBERATING THE LEBANESE INDEPENDENT </p><p>DECISION WHICH, ALONE, IS CAPABLE OF ALLOWING </p><p>US TO FACE SUCCESSFULLY THE SECOND DECADE OF </p><p>OUR BITTER STRUGGLE.  TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE MUST: </p><p> </p><p>"FIRSTLY, RESHUFFLE THE ORGANIZATIONAL AND IN- </p><p> </p><p>STITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY; </p><p> </p><p>"SECONDLY, REBUILD THE SOCIAL SECURITY OF THE </p><p>CHRISTIANS ON NEW FOUNDATIONS BASED UPON: </p><p> </p><p>A)  AN INSTITUTIONAL AND CENTRAL CHRISTIAN </p><p>INDEPENDENT DECISION; </p><p> </p><p>B)  A CO-ORDINATING, CONSULTATIVE AND EXECUTIVE </p><p>FRAMEWORK GROUPING THE VARIOUS SOCIAL AND CHURCH </p><p>LEADERSHIPS; </p><p> </p><p>C)  ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRATEGIES OF A COMPLEMENTARY </p><p>NATURE AIMED OVERRUNNING ALL STANDING DIFFICULTIES. </p><p>AND THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THIS IS THE CORRECTION OF </p><p>THE STRUCTURES AS TO ENSURE THEIR ECONOMIC AND </p><p>SOCIAL EFFICIENCY; </p><p> </p><p>D)LEGAL INSTITUTIONS ACTUALLY PERFORMING THEIR </p><p>NATIONAL OVERALL REPRESENTATIVE ROLE; </p><p> </p><p>E)  AN ETHNIC AND CULTURAL IDENTITY WITH CLEAR- </p><p>CUT FEATURES AND CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL BALANCED </p><p>STRATEGIES. </p><p> </p><p>"CHRISTIAN LEBANESE, </p><p> </p><p>"WE ARE A PEOPLE WHOSE ENTITY IS BASED UPON RESPECT </p><p>AND COMMITMENT TOWARDS ALL CAUSES INVOLVING THE </p><p>FATE OF MAN OR HIS DIGNITY AND WHEREVER MAN\'S </p><p>LIBERTIES ARE JEOPARDIZED OR UNSECURE. </p><p> </p><p>"THERE CAN BE NO HAZARDS IN CHRISTIANITY BUT DECISIONS </p><p>INSPIRED BY THE HOLY GOSPEL, BY JESUS-CHRIST\'S OWN </p><p>WORDS:  SPEAK ALWAYS THE TRUTH AND BE STRAIGHT- </p><p>FORWARD:  NO FOR NO AND YEST FOR YES".
