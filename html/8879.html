<p>S E C R E T THE HAGUE 001595 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, IS, NL, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: DUTCH CANDIDATE FOR EU MIDDLE EAST ENVOY </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POL COUNSELOR MARY E. DALY FOR REASONS 1.5 B AND D </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Noting that Marcel Kurpershoek is one of two </p><p>finalists to replace Angel Moratinos, we want to share our </p><p>impressions and some biographic details.  Kurpershoek </p><p>currently is resident in Pakistan, where he serves as Dutch </p><p>ambassador to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, </p><p>Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan.  Previously, he headed the </p><p>MFA\'s middle east bureau. He also has served in Damascus, </p><p>Cairo, Riyadh, and Brussels. Kurpershoek is widely respected </p><p>for his expertise in the Middle East.  He taught at Leiden </p><p>University and has published frequently, including a book </p><p>based on his experiences living with Bedouins in Saudi </p><p>Arabia, and several works on Arab literature. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/N) In Pol Counselor\'s last conversation with </p><p>Kurpershoek before his departure for Pakistan, Kurpershoek </p><p>expressed great sympathy for the Palestinians.  Although he </p><p>obviously disapproved of terrorism as a political tool, he </p><p>cited the very difficult conditions under which Palestinians </p><p>live and their hopelessness as naturally leading to </p><p>terrorism.  Similarly, he was of the opinion that we were </p><p>expecting more from Arafat than Arafat could possibly </p><p>deliver.  The onus, he said, was on PM Sharon to stop </p><p>settlements and offer some hope to the Palestinians for a </p><p>political settlement.  Some of Kupershoek\'s statements no </p><p>doubt were deliberately calibrated to jolt the American pol </p><p>counselor.  That said, you can assume that if he gets the </p><p>post, his bias will be at least slightly toward the </p><p>Palestians.   The Israeli DCM (protect) in The Hague put it </p><p>succinctly, "he has the right curriculum vitae for the job </p><p>and the right contacts but I personally would not be happy. </p><p>He is not the best on even handedness and is not the Dutchman </p><p>the Israeli embassy would like to see in the job."  According </p><p>to the Israeli DCM, Kurpershoek\'s contacts with the Israeli </p><p>left are particular good.  Kurpershoek is allegedly the man </p><p>behind the efforts of former FM van Aartsen to start up </p><p>"secret talks" in The Hague among Israelis and Palestinians </p><p>early in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/N)  A senior official at the MFA says that the Dutch </p><p>government hopes Kurpershoek gets the job in order to </p><p>strengthen the Dutch role in EU deliberations on the Middle </p><p>East.  The Dutch government overall has been a very helpful </p><p>voice within the EU for keeping EU policy on the Middle East </p><p>in line with that of the U.S. and for ensuring a balanced </p><p>approach toward Israel.  FM de Hoop Scheffer is considered </p><p>"pro-Israel," and the government has successfully stopped </p><p>several efforts in parliament to ban the transport of weapons </p><p>to Israel via Schiphol. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
