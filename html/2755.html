<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001851 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM EST COUNSELOR MULENEX FOR OES </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENVSENV </p><p>SUBJECT: HUBS AND ENVIRONMENTAL DIPLOMACY </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 64043 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY. MY STINT AS EST HUB OFFICER IN COPENHAGEN </p><p>FOLLOWED MY ASSIGNMENT AS SCIENCE OFFICER IN TEL AVIV,AND </p><p>PRECEDED MY CURRENT ASSIGNMENT AS SCIENCE OFFICER IN ROME. </p><p>OF THE THREE, ONLY THE ROME ASSIGNMENT IS STRICTLY BILATERAL. </p><p>REGIONAL WORK, WHETHER ORGANIZED INFORMALLY, AS IN TEL AVIV, </p><p>OR FORMALLY, AS IN COPENHAGEN, PROVIDES MORE SCOPE FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01851  01 OF 02  121558Z </p><p>INFLUENCE THAN A BILATERAL ASSIGNMENT CAN, IF THE REGIONAL </p><p>WORK IS SUPPORTED BY DEPT. AND WASHINGTON AGENCIES AND BY THE </p><p>COUNTRY TEAMS OF ALL THE U.S. MISSIONS IN THE ASSIGNED </p><p>REGION. ADEQUATE PERMAMENT STAFF, MONIES SUFFICIENT TO </p><p>SUPPORT AT LEAST BI-MONTHLY TRAVEL TO ASSIGNED POSTS, AND </p><p>ENOUGH MONEY FOR REGIONAL SEED PROGRAMS ARE FUNDAMENTAL FOR </p><p>SUCCESS.  AN EFFECTIVE OFFICER WITHOUT THE CONFIDENCE AND </p><p>TRUST OF COLLEAGUES, OR WITHOUT THE RESOURCES TO GET A SEAT </p><p>AT THE MULTILATERAL OR REGIONAL PROJECT TABLE, WILL ENJOY </p><p>VERY LIMITED SUCCESS. IN EVERY CASE, THE SMALLNESS OF HUB </p><p>OPERATIONS REQUIRES CAREFUL SELECTION OF JUST A FEW ISSUES, </p><p>WHICH ARE HIGH INTEREST AND HIGH VALUE FOR THE REGION, AND ON </p><p>WHICH THE HUB CAN MAKE MEASURABLE PROGRESS. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>INSIDE, OUTSIDE, OR ON THE EDGE? </p><p> </p><p>2. THERE ARE THREE CONTEXTS IN WHICH A SUCCESSFUL HUB HAS TO </p><p>BE AN INSIDE PLAYER: (1) WITHIN THE COUNTRY TEAMS OF THE </p><p>EMBASSIES IN THE DESIGNATED REGION;(2)WITHIN THE RELEVANT </p><p>PARTS OF HOST GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL/REGIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, AND (3) WITHIN THE POLICY FORMATION AND </p><p>RESOURCE ALLOCATION PROCESS IN THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER USG </p><p>AGENCIES.  A WELL-STAFFED AND FUNDED HUB WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>SUCCEED BY DELIVERING POLICY POSITIONS AND PROGRAMMING OF </p><p>HIGH VALUE TO SERVICED EMBASSIES, BY REPRESENTING U.S. POLICY </p><p>AUTHORITATIVELY IN REGIONAL DISCUSSIONS, AND BY BECOMING THE </p><p>KEY COORDINATOR FOR USG AGENCIES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>U.S. EST POLICIES.  THE INTELLECTUAL INTERCHANGE BETWEEN THE </p><p>HUB AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO BE REAL--NOT OFF THE SHELF AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01851  01 OF 02  121558Z </p><p>GENERIC --AND THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO ACCEPT THE SPECIAL </p><p>OBLIGATION TO CONSULT WITH THE HUB ON ITS CORE ISSUES.  THIS </p><p>IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT FOR OES, WHERE MULTIPLE, OFTEN </p><p>MULTILATERAL TASKS TOO FREQUENTLY BECOME WASHINGTON-CENTRIC, </p><p>AND THE PRESS TO COORDINATE THE WASHINGTON INTERAGENCY </p><p>PROCESS, RESULTS IN A LACK OF TIMELY AND PROPERLY TARGETED </p><p>INFORMATION TO THE FIELD.  CATCHING THE HUB UNAWARE WITH A </p><p>CHANGE OF POSITION CAN BE A REAL PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT\'S THE RIGHT SIZE FOR HUBS? </p><p> </p><p>3. A HUB BY ITS NATURE IS NOT A BILATERAL CREATURE, BUT </p><p>ADDRESSES CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES. ITS RESOURCE PACKAGE MAY VARY </p><p>BETWEEN REGIONS, AND RESOURCES MAY BE APPLIED UNEVENLY TO </p><p>INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, OR PROGRAM ACTIVITIES, </p><p>E.G. CONCENTRATING ON WATERSHED MANAGEMENT RATHER THAN </p><p>COASTAL ZONES AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS.  A FIRST GENERAL RULE </p><p>MIGHT BE:  DON\'T COMPETE WITH INDIVIDUAL MISSION RESOURCES. </p><p>WHILE IN COPENHAGEN, I FOUND THAT EMBASSY STOCKHOLM ASSIGNED </p><p>AN ECONOMIC OFFICER ALMOST FULLTIME TO EST WORK, PROVIDING </p><p>MORE BREADTH AND DEPTH THAN I COULD HOPE TO WITH EVEN MONTHLY </p><p>VISITS.  A SECOND RULE IS TO RECOGNIZE IMPORTANT BILATERAL </p><p>EST ISSUES AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE BILATERAL MISSION IS BEST </p><p>PLACED TO FOLLOW THOSE ISSUES. IN NORWAY, WHALING WAS SUCH AN </p><p>ISSUE WHILE I WAS IN COPENHAGEN; SO WAS THE TRILATERAL WORK </p><p>ON NUCLEAR WASTE.  IN GENERAL, I BELIEVE ABOUT ONE-HALF FTE </p><p>IS NEEDED AT THE HUB FOR EACH POST TO BE SERVED.  LESS THAN </p><p>THIS MEANS THE HUB IS JUST ANOTHER TDY CIRCUIT-RIDER; MORE </p><p>THAN THIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER ADDITIONAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01851  01 OF 02  121558Z </p><p>POSITIONS, WHETHER FSN OR AMERICAN, SHOULDN\'T BE DEVELOPED </p><p>FOR SERVICED POSTS.  WHATEVER THE LEVEL OF HUB STAFFING, AN </p><p>EXTENDED TEAM CONCEPT IS NEEDED THAT ALLOWS RAPID EXCHANGE OF </p><p>INFORMATION AMONG POSTS IN THE HUB REGION ON CROSS-CUTTING </p><p>ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY THE HUB. </p><p> </p><p>LEADING BY TRAVELING,COMMUNICATING, AND NETWORKING LOCALLY </p><p> </p><p>4. WHAT MAKES A HUB VISIT DIFFERENT THAN A VISIT FROM A </p><p>WASHINGTON TECHNICAL EXPERT OR A POLICY OFFICIAL? IT\'S NOT </p><p>USUALLY SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION OR FIELD WORK, AND EVEN LESS </p><p>OFTEN THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE POLICY DECISIONS.  IT HAS TO BE </p><p>LOCAL KNOWLEDGE OF PROBLEMS, OF INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING </p><p>SPECIAL INTERESTS AND RIVALRIES), AND OF PEOPLE. IN PRACTICAL </p><p>TERMS, THIS MEANS A VISIT TO EACH HUB POST EVERY 6-8 WEEKS, </p><p>WHICH TELLS YOU ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY YOU NEED FOR TRAVEL AND </p><p>HOW MANY POSITIONS YOU NEED AT THE HUB. IN COPENHAGEN, I </p><p>LEARNED THAT THE REAL DECISIONS FOR BALTIC-NORDIC COOPERATION </p><p>WERE TAKEN IN A VARIETY OF EU AND OTHER REGIONAL FORA, AND </p><p>GAINING ACCESS TO THOSE MEETINGS AS A QUALIFIED OBSERVER WAS </p><p>THE KEY TO INTRODUCING U.S. IDEAS INTO PROGRAMS WE HAD FEW </p><p>FUNDS TO SUPPORT.  WE COULD HELP WITH EXPERTS IN MANY CASES, </p><p>AND BUILD JOINT WORKSHOPS AND TECHNICAL EXCHANGES.

THE HUB HAS </p><p>TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH ITS USG CONSTITUENCY AND ITS BROADER </p><p>NETWORK OF COOPERATING INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>POLICIES AND PROGRAMS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01851  02 OF 02  121559Z </p><p> </p><p>5. HUBS UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT RELIEVE SHORTSTAFFED MISSIONS OR </p><p>SEP POSTS OF THE BURDEN FOR PREPARING, DELIVERING AND </p><p>REPORTING ON DEMARCHES, ALTHOUGH THE HUB SHOULD BE A LOCAL </p><p>RESOURCE HELPFUL IN PROVIDING THE BACKGROUND TO AN ISSUE, OR </p><p>IN CLARIFYING THE SOMETIMES LENGTHY TECHNICAL INFORMATION </p><p>PROVIDED ON ISSUES LIKE CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT.  ON A FEW </p><p>OCCASIONS I WAS ASKED TO JOIN A SERVICED POST TEAM IN MAKING </p><p>A PARTICULAR DEMARCHE, BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT </p><p>COUNTRY WAS EXPECTED TO PLAY IN MULTILATERAL DISCUSSIONS. HUB </p><p>OFFICER SHOULD BE MORE CONVERSANT WITH EST ISSUES THAN MOST </p><p>OF THE OFFICERS ON THEIR REGIONAL TEAM.  FOR THIS REASON, IT </p><p>IS PROBABLY UNWISE TO NAME AN OFFICER TO A HUB WHO HAS </p><p>NEITHER DEPT., OTHER AGENCY, OR PREVIOUS OVERSEAS EST </p><p>EXPERIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>6. PROGRAMMATICALLY,THE SAME RULE APPLIES. AN EXPERIENCED </p><p>OFFICER IS MORE LIKELY TO BE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN DISCUSSIONS </p><p>WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS, NGOS,AND REGIONAL BODIES THAN A </p><p>NOVICE. EXPERIENCED OFFICERS ARE ALSO LIKELY TO HAVE A </p><p>NETWORK OF CONTACTS INTO OTHER AGENCIES WHICH ARE, FRANKLY </p><p>SPEAKING, MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SUPPORTING EXPERTISE AND </p><p>FINANCIAL RESOURCES. PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT WITH MULTIPLE </p><p>PARTNERS IS A COMPLEX UNDERTAKING, AND EXPERIENCE IS A REAL </p><p>ASSET IN SORTING OUT WHO DOES WHAT, WHEN, AND HOW.  I LEARNED </p><p>A GREAT DEAL ABOUT PROGRAM MANAGEMENT FROM MY WORK AS A GRANT </p><p>OFFICER FOR USAID PROGRAMS IN TEL AVIV, AND WITHOUT THE </p><p>EXPERIENCE OF RUNNING SCIENCE COOPERATIVE GRANTS IN TWENTY </p><p>COUNTRIES, I COULD NOT HAVE MANAGED THE COPENHAGEN START-UP. </p><p> </p><p>GLOBAL WARRIORS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY? </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01851  02 OF 02  121559Z </p><p> </p><p>7. SOME WILL RECALL THESE WORDS OF TIM WIRTH; THOSE WHO DO </p><p>RECALL THAT THE WORDS WERE JUST THAT.  THE HUBS REPRESENT A </p><p>HALFWAY HOUSE IN THE MOVE FROM OUR LONG-STANDING ADDICTION TO </p><p>BILATERAL ACTION IN A MULTILATERAL EST WORLD.  WHILE THERE </p><p>WILL REMAIN SOME NEED FOR BILATERAL APPROACHES AND  COUNTRY </p><p>SPECIFIC S&T RELATIONSHIPS, THE NEED FOR THE MOST EXPERIENCED </p><p>EST OFFICERS TO FILL EXCLUSIVELY BILATERAL JOBS MAY BE </p><p>CHANGING  IF THE PROGRAM ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY THE DEPT. </p><p>CONFIRMS MY EXPERIENCE, HUBS REPRESENT A VALID APPROACH TO </p><p>THE PERSONAL NETWORK BUILDING NEEDED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE </p><p>ACTION ON A REGIONAL LEVEL. PROBABLY MORE SUPPORT IN TERMS OF </p><p>POSITIONS, BUDGET, AND EQUIPMENT IS NEEDED, CONSISTENT WITH </p><p>WHAT I\'VE ALREADY SAID. </p><p> </p><p>8. IT\'S THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO PUT SOLID EXPERIENCED OFFICERS </p><p>IN THE HUBS. FROM MY BILATERAL POSITION IN ROME, I RUB UP </p><p>EVERY DAY AGAINST ISSUES WHICH I COULD WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY </p><p>ACROSS THE REGION. YET THE ROME BILATERAL POSITION IS MORE </p><p>SENIOR, RANK-WISE, THAN THE HUB POSITIONS WHICH OFFER MORE </p><p>SCOPE TO WORK OUR MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES. THIS IS AN ARTIFACT </p><p>OF A PRE-INTERNET, COLD WAR APPROACH TO EST "IN CAPITALS", AS </p><p>THE CABLES SAY. THE DEPT. MAY WANT TO USE THE HUB STUDY AS A </p><p>FOIL FOR A CAREFUL RECONSIDERATION OF OVERALL EST POSITIONS </p><p>ABROAD. </p><p> </p><p>9. A FINAL NOTE: THE HUBS ESTABLISHED TO DATE HAVE </p><p>GEOGRAPHIC, NOT INTELLECTUAL,PROPERTY. WHILE ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>PROBLEMS ARE LOCAL, THEY OFTEN HAVE REGIONAL OR GLOBAL CAUSES </p><p>AND INFLUENCES.  I HAVE LONG ADVOCATED THE NEED TO INTEGRATE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01851  02 OF 02  121559Z </p><p>SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY,AND PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR HUB WORK, AND </p><p>THAT WAS MY PRACTICE BOTH IN TEL AVIV AND COPENHAGEN. PERHAPS </p><p>IT\'S TIME TO CONSIDER THE MERITS OF A HUB THAT TAKES AS ITS </p><p>CORE WORK A MAJOR THEME, LIKE SUSTAINABILITY IN ALL ITS </p><p>MULTIPLE AND CONFLICTING MEANING, AND ITS CHALLENGES TO </p><p>SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, TRADE AND </p><p>INVESTMENT, INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. </p><p>THIS IS TAILOR MADE FOR THE U.S-EU AGENDA, AND FOR ITALY IN </p><p>PARTICULAR AS IT LOOKS TO THE MEDITERRANEAN BASIN AND TO </p><p>AFRICA. IT\'S MY MODEST SUGGESTION FOR A HUB WE COULD CREATE </p><p>AND STAFF TO SUPPORT THE POST-JOHANNNESBURG AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>9. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE IDEAS IN SUCH A </p><p>PERSONAL WAY. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01851 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
