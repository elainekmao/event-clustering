<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002809 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, ASEC, CASC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: RENEWED VIOLENCE IN EASTERN PLATEAU STATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) At approximately 16:00 on October 8, Conoff received </p><p>a report from an AmCit in Jos of ethnic fighting in eastern </p><p>Plateau State. According to the AmCit, the fighting that had </p><p>flared a few days ago in the Local Government Areas (LGAs)of </p><p>Langtang and Pankshin had rekindled with greater intensity. </p><p>The conflict essentially pits pastoral Fulani against farmers </p><p>from various other groups but has taken on a distinct </p><p>inter-ethnic tinge.  The Plateau State government has </p><p>downplayed the scope and severity of the reported violence. </p><p>When we tried to confirm the reports, Gabriel Makan, PA to </p><p>Governor Dariye, denied any outbreaks of violence on October </p><p>8.  We find the AmCit more credible than Makan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) According to the Amcit, small villages around Langtang </p><p>and Pankshin were most affected by the fighting. (Pankshin is </p><p>about 85 km South East of Jos and Lantang is  about 130 km </p><p>South East of Jos.) The Amcit also reported fighting in </p><p>Bukuru, about 12 kilometers southwest of Jos, had taken place </p><p>the morning of October 7.  Some distance from the both </p><p>Pankshin and Langtang, the Bukuru violence may not be related </p><p>to the incidents at the other locations. However, it </p><p>demonstrates that portions of Plateau State remain volatile, </p><p>and unrest can easily be sparked in these areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Governor Dariye\'s Assistant Makan confirmed the </p><p>village of Kumkwan in Kanam LGA had been substantially </p><p>destroyed but insisted the destruction occurred October 1. </p><p>Makan further asserted the conflict in Kumkwan was between </p><p>the ethnically related Tarok and Bagam tribes; Fulani were </p><p>not involved. (Note: The Plateau State Government has </p><p>publicly stated that order was restored days ago; However, </p><p>the Amcit report contradicts this.  In fact, it indicates </p><p>that the situation in the eastern part of the state may have </p><p>deteriorated, perhaps due to reprisal attacks by those caught </p><p>on the defensive in the earlier unrest. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) According to Makan, Bukuru was the site of a minor </p><p>incident on October 6.  The State Government has plans to </p><p>erect a permanent market but shop owners protested when their </p><p>make-shift stores were demolished to make room for the </p><p>permanent structure.  Makan stated the police quickly </p><p>restored order and no lives were lost.  Bukuru is close to </p><p>the Abuja-Akwanga-Jos highway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Plateau State is home to a significant number of </p><p>AmCits, mainly missionaries, and Post will continue to </p><p>monitor the situation and report any new developments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) There were no reports of any Amcits caught in the </p><p>unrest. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
