<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 VATICAN 005288 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI) </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN MESSAGE NO. 170/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/9/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AM, KZ, TU, RO, UP, BO, BU, VT </p><p>SUBJECT:  POPE\'S VISIT TO ARMENIA AND KAZAKHSTAN: VATICAN\'S </p><p>GEOPOLITICAL/RELIGIOUS MANEUVERING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR R. JAMES NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(A) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) SUMMARY:  VATICAN OFFICIALS AND OBSERVERS DESCRIBE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  05288  01 OF 03  111456Z </p><p>POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S SEPTEMBER 22-27 TRIP TO KAZAKHSTAN AND </p><p>ARMENIA AS SUCCESSFUL. THE VATICAN HAD THREE OBJECTIVES FOR </p><p>THIS TRIP: 1) CONTINUE THE PRESSURE ON THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCH TO ALLOW A VISIT TO MOSCOW; 2) BOLSTER THE "MODERATE </p><p>ISLAMIC" GOVERNMENT IN KAZAKHSTAN AND HOLD IT UP AS AN </p><p>EXAMPLE; 3) INCREMENTALLY MOVE FORWARD THE DIALOG BETWEEN </p><p>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH </p><p>WHICH THE POPE HOPES WILL LEAD TO REUNIFICATION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) EMBASSY OFFICERS MET WITH SEVERAL VATICAN OFFICIALS </p><p>AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC OBSERVERS IN WAKE OF POPE JOHN PAUL </p><p>II\'S VISIT TO KAZAKHSTAN AND ARMENIA SEPTEMBER 22-27. </p><p>VATICAN DIRECTOR FOR RUSSIA AND THE FORMER STATES OF THE </p><p>SOVIET UNION, ARCHBISHOP TRICARICO TOLD DCM THAT THE VISIT </p><p>WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN FURTHER ISOLATING RUSSIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>PATRIARCH ALEXI AND MAINTAINING PRESSURE TO PERMIT A VISIT </p><p>TO MOSCOW IN THE RELATIVELY NEAR FUTURE.  TRICARICO SAID </p><p>THAT WITH THE VISIT TO KAZAKHSTAN, THE ANNOUNCED 2002 VISIT </p><p>TO BULGARIA, AND PROBABLE VISIT TO BELARUS, THE POPE WILL </p><p>HAVE "SURROUNDED" ALEXI.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE POPE WILL </p><p>HAVE SHOWN ALEXI THAT RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CLAIMS OF </p><p>TERRITORIAL-CANONICAL PREROGATIVES ARE MEANINGLESS IN THE </p><p>MODERN WORLD.  IRONICALLY, ON OCTOBER 2, RUSSIAN EMBASSY TO </p><p>THE VATICAN DCM, DMITRI SHTODIN SECONDED THIS VIEW TO DCM. </p><p>SHTODIN SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS PUTTING "PRESSURE" ON </p><p>ALEXI TO INVITE THE POPE TO MOSCOW.  HE NOTED THE RELATIVELY </p><p>MODERATE STATEMENTS OF THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX\'S CHURCH </p><p>"MINISTER FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS" KYRIL CONCERNING THE POPE </p><p>VISIT TO KAZAKHSTAN AS AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>HAVING AN INFLUENCE.  (NOTE: THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH DID </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  05288  01 OF 03  111456Z </p><p>NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE POPE\'S VISIT TO ARMENIA AS THE </p><p>ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH IS NOT IN COMMUNION WITH THE </p><p>ORTHODOX CHURCH AND MOSCOW HAS NEVER CONSIDERED ARMENIA AS </p><p>BEING IN ITS CANONICAL TERRITORY). TRICARICO SAID THE POPE </p><p>DID NOT RAISE NAGORO/KARABACH WHILE IN YERAVAN.  HOWEVER, </p><p>WHEN DCM POSED THE SAME QUESTION TO RUSSIAN DCM SHTODIN THE </p><p>REPLY WAS THAT HE HAD SEEN A REPORTING CABLE WHICH STATED </p><p>THE ISSUE WAS DISCUSSED WITH THE ARMENIAN PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER MIGLIORE (SEPTEL), </p><p>TOLD POLOFF AND DCM THAT THE VATICAN IS CONVINCED THAT THE </p><p>RUSSIAN ORTHODOX ARE FEELING THE PRESSURE, AND THAT A TRIP </p><p>TO MOSCOW IS NO LONGER AN UNREACHABLE GOAL.  DCM ALSO MET </p><p>WITH FATHER GIOVANNI MATERA, THE RECTOR OF THE BASILICA OF </p><p>SAINT NICOLAS IN BARI, ON OCTOBER 8.  ALTHOUGH A ROMAN </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH, BARI AND THE CHURCH ARE THE CENTER OF </p><p>RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH\'S OFFICIAL REPRESENTATION TO ITALY </p><p>(HAVING REJECTED ROME BECAUSE OF THE POPE\'S PRESENCE). </p><p>FATHER GIOVANNI SAID THAT THERE WILL BE A CATHOLIC/ORTHODOX </p><p>MEETING HOSTED BY THE BASILICA ON NOVEMBER 25 WHICH </p><p>METROPOLITAN KYRIL IS EXPECTED TO ATTEND; THE QUESTION OF </p><p>THE POPE\'S VISIT TO MOSCOW IS ON THE AGENDA. </p><p> </p><p>4.(C) COMMENT: IN ADDITION TO FURTHER ISOLATING PATRIARCH </p><p>ALEXI, THE VISIT TO KAZAKHSTAN WAS DESIGNED TO EXTOL </p><p>RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE IN A PROMINENTLY MUSLIM COUNTRY. </p><p>KAZAKHSTAN IS THE FIRST MUSLIM COUNTRY WHICH HAS CONCLUDED A </p><p>CONCORDAT (EG. A TREATY REGULATING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF </p><p>THE CATHOLIC CHURCH) WITH THE VATICAN.  THE VISIT TO </p><p>KAZAKHSTAN IS PART OF THE VATICAN\'S AGENDA FOR THE POPE TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  05288  01 OF 03  111456Z </p><p>VISIT MODERATE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES TO BOLSTER THEIR POPULARITY </p><p>IN THE FACE OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) COMMENT CONT\'D: THE MAIN THRUST OF THE VISIT TO </p><p>ARMENIA WAS TO FURTHER THE PROCESS OF DIALOG BETWEEN THE </p><p>ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE APOSTOLIC CATHOLIC CHURCH.  A </p><p>SIDE BENEFIT WAS THE FACT THAT ARMENIA, BEING ANOTHER FORMER </p><p>SOVIET REPUBLIC, WAS AN ADDITIONAL BLATANT REMINDER OF THE </p><p>MOSCOW PATRIARCH\'S OBSTINACY.  THEOLOGICALLY, THE ROMAN </p><p>CHURCH AND THE ARMENIAN CHURCH HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN </p><p>ELIMINATING THEIR DIFFERENCES.  THE REMAINING PROBLEMS </p><p>INCLUDE THE ROLE OF THE POPE, AS WELL AS THE ARMENIAN </p><p>CHURCH\'S COMMUNION WITH THE COPTIC CHURCH WHICH WANTS TO GO </p><p>MUCH MORE SLOWLY ON ANY DISCUSSIONS ON REUNIFICATION WITH </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA05288 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
