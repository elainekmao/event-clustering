<p>S E C R E T TEGUCIGALPA 001499 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>FOR GENERAL HILL AND WHA/FISK FROM AMBASSADOR PALMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: OFFICIAL INFORMAL - RESUMPTION OF AIR-TRACKING </p><p>INFORMATION SHARING WITH THE GOH </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 144757 </p><p> </p><p>     B. USDAO TEGUCIGALPA 052246Z JUN 03 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Larry L. Palmer; </p><p>Reasons 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) General Hill: </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for your May 29 note in which you requested the </p><p>April 15 accident investigation report and a review of the </p><p>substantive actions taken be the Honduran military to prevent </p><p>a similar occurrence from happening in the future. I will </p><p>provide you a copy of the official accident report issued by </p><p>the Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF) to Honduran Minister of </p><p>Defense Federico Breve, coupled with an informal translation </p><p>completed by the Embassy.  (Note, the date of the report is </p><p>March 14, rather than April 15, due to an error by the GOH.) </p><p> </p><p>Regarding substantive actions taken by the HOAF to prevent a </p><p>similar incident from reoccurring, the HOAF recently </p><p>announced a shift from aerial interdiction to a ground </p><p>interdiction strategy (ref B).  While the HOAF could have </p><p>withdrawn entirely from any counter-drug participation during </p><p>the suspension of intelligence sharing, this strategy shift </p><p>demonstrates that they are still engaged, and is a direct </p><p>result of MOD Breve\'s new strategic focus to combat drug </p><p>trafficking while avoiding the pitfalls of shooting down a </p><p>plane.  I believe that a new and unequivocal understanding </p><p>exists between the HOAF and the senior Honduran civilian </p><p>leadership which will not permit a future shoot-down incident </p><p>to occur.  The Government of Hondurans and its Armed Forces </p><p>are ready to move forward in accordance with SOUTHCOM policy </p><p>on intelligence sharing. </p><p> </p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to work with you on this </p><p>important issue and look forward to the resumption of </p><p>air-track information sharing with the GOH at the earliest </p><p>possible opportunity. </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p> </p><p>Larry Palmer </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
