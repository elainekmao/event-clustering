<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABU DHABI 05867 </p><p> </p><p>FROM AMCONSUL DUBAI </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINR, PGOV, PREL, IR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  ENGINEER COMMENTS ON LIFE IN RASHT, AND THE </p><p>-         LIKELY LEADERS OF A POST-KHOMEINI IRAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  AN IRANIAN ENGINEER CLAIMED THAT WHILE SOME </p><p>INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES IN THE CITY OF RASHT HAVE BEEN </p><p>FORCED TO SEND EMPLOYEES TO THE WAR, THERE HAS BEEN NO </p><p>SHORTAGE OF VOLUNTEERS.  SINCE THE FIRMS WERE OPERATING AT </p><p>LESS THAN FULL CAPACITY, THEIR ABSENCE AFFECTED OUTPUT ONLY </p><p>MARGINALLY.  INDUSTRIAL CHIEFS IN THE REGION WERE ESCORTED </p><p>LAST SPRING THROUGH THE FAO PENINSULA.  WEST GERMANY IS </p><p>TRAINING MANY OF THESE ENGINEERS IN A "DIVIDEND-FOR-TRAIN- </p><p>ING" EXCHANGE PROGRAM.  KHOMEINI IS LIKELY TO BE SUCCEEDED </p><p>BY A "GROUP OF FIVE" THAT INCLUDES MONTAZERI, RAFSANJANI, </p><p>KHAMENEI, AHMAD KHOMEINI, AND MESHKINI.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON NOVEMBER 22, CONOFF DUBAI SPOKE WITH A U. S.- </p><p>TRAINED IRANIAN ENGINEER RESPONSIBLE FOR WATER SYSTEMS IN </p><p>A FACTORY IN BANDAR ANZALI, NEAR RASHT.  IRANIAN\'S OBSER- </p><p>VATIONS ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>4.  INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AND WAR RECRUITMENT:  OF THE THREE </p><p>MAJOR INDUSTRIES IN RASHT, THE TEXTILE AND PAPER MILLS ARE </p><p>RUNNING AT ONLY ONE-HALF CAPACITY, WHILE THE ELECTRIC POWER </p><p>PLANT CONTINUES AT FULL CAPACITY.  TEN PER CENT OF THE TEX- </p><p>TILE AND PAPER EMPLOYEES HAVE HAD TO SERVE AT THE WAR </p><p>FRONT, BUT THE POWER PLANT EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN EXEMPTED. </p><p>SOURCE CLAIMED THAT NO FORCE HAD TO BE USED TO COERCE EM- </p><p>PLOYEES TO JOIN THE MILITARY.  "BRAIN-WASHING" HAS BEEN SO </p><p>EFFECTIVE THAT "IN RASHT THERE IS NEVER A SHORTAGE OF </p><p>BASIJ."  VOLUNTEERS ARE GIVEN 45 DAYS OF TRAINING IN RASHT, </p><p>AND THEN ARE SENT FOR TWO TO FOUR WEEKS FURTHER TRAINING </p><p>NEAR TEHRAN.  HE SAID MANY IRANIANS BELIEVE THAT AN END TO </p><p>THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR WOULD NOT NECESSARILY MEAN AN END TO CON- </p><p>FRONTATION.  THEY SEE THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR INCAPABLE OF </p><p>ABSORBING IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND REASON THAT NEW CONFRONTA- </p><p>TIONS, PERHAPS WITH PAKISTAN, WOULD BE USED TO KEEP THE </p><p>SOLDIERS "OCCUPIED." </p><p> </p><p>5.  INDUSTRIAL HEADS VISIT FAO:  IN APRIL, 1986, THE GOI </p><p>ORGANIZED A TWO-WEEK TRIP TO THE FAO WAR FRONT FOR RASHT </p><p>INDUSTRIAL LEADERS.  THE TRIP HAD TWO OBJECTIVES:  FIRST, </p><p>TO FAMILIARIZE INDUSTRIAL HEADS WITH THE TYPES OF EQUIPMENT </p><p>BEING USED SO THAT THEIR FACTORIES COULD FABRICATE SPARE </p><p>PARTS.  SAMPLE EQUIPMENT AND PARTS WERE COLLECTED, BUT AT- </p><p>TEMPTS TO REPRODUCE THEM IN RASHT AND BANDAR ANZALI FAILED. </p><p>MOST SPARE PARTS, HE SAID, PARTICULARLY THOSE FOR HIGH </p><p>PRESSURE COMPRESSORS, ARE BEING FABRICATED FROM AMERICAN </p><p>AND BRITISH DESIGNS IN TURKEY, AND ARE BEING TRUCKED INTO </p><p>IRAN.  A SECOND OBJECTIVE WAS TO HAVE INDUSTRIAL LEADERS </p><p>WITNESS THE DETERMINATION OF THE MILITARY, AND CONVEY </p><p>FAVORABLE IMPRESSIONS TO THEIR NEIGHBORS AND EMPLOYEES IN </p><p>RASHT SO THAT THE FLOW OF BASIJ VOLUNTEERS WOULD CONTINUE </p><p>UNIMPEDED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  EXCHANGING EMPLOYEE TRAINING FOR DIVIDENDS:  SOURCE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THE GOI OWNS 25 PER CENT OF THE GERMAN COR- </p><p>PORATE GIANT KRUPP.  INSTEAD OF PAYING DIVIDENDS TO THE </p><p>GOI, THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT HAS WORKED OUT A SCHEME WHEREBY </p><p>IRANIAN ENGINEERS ARE SENT FOR INDUSTRIAL TRAINING IN </p><p>GERMANY INSTEAD.  SOURCE SAID THAT IN THE SUMMER OF 1985, </p><p>HE HAD RECEIVED A TWO-WEEK TRAINING COURSE IN WEST GERMANY </p><p>IN ASSORTED METHODS OF WASTE WATER TREATMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  HOW MANY AYATOLLAHS DOES IT TAKE TO REPLACE KHOMEINI?: </p><p>THIS SOURCE AND OTHER IRANIAN CONTACTS IN DUBAI BELIEVE </p><p>THAT MUCH OF AYATOLLAH MONTAZERI\'S RECENT DIFFICULTIES, IN- </p><p>CLUDING THE ARREST OF MEHDI HASHEMI, ARE TRACEABLE TO AN </p><p>UNWILLINGNESS AMONG OTHER LEADERS TO ACCEPT MONTAZERI AS </p><p>THE SOLE LEADER OF THE POST-KHOMEINI ERA.  THE IRANIAN </p><p>CONSTITUTION ALLOWS FOR A THREE-TO-FIVE-PERSON GROUP TO </p><p>LEAD THE NATION, AND THE LIKELY FIVE WHO WOULD SHARE THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP AFTER KHOMEINI\'S DEATH APPEAR TO BE:  (A) </p><p>AYATOLLAH MONTAZERI--HAVING BEEN CHOSEN BY KHOMEINI, HE IS </p><p>NOT LIKELY TO BE EXCLUDED.  HE IS SEEN BY MOST IRANIANS AS </p><p>A "COMPASSIONATE" LEADER, IN CONTRAST TO THE "DICTATORIAL" </p><p>KHOMEINI, DESPITE HIS EVIDENT LACK OF SOPHISTICATION OR </p><p>COHERENT WORLD VIEW. </p><p> </p><p>(B)  HOJJAT-OL-ESLAM RAFSANJANI--AS SPEAKER OF THE PARLIA- </p><p>MENT, HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO SHAPE EVENTS TO HIS OWN ADVANT- </p><p>AGE.  IRANIANS CONTINUE TO NOTE THAT IT IS "NO COINCID- </p><p>ENCE" THAT RAFSANJANI WAS ABSENT BOTH TIMES WHEN BOMBS </p><p>KILLED MANY OF HIS LIKELY RIVALS.  MANY IRANIANS BELIEVE </p><p>THAT HE WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO ASSURE HIS PLACE IN THE </p><p>"GROUP OF FIVE" AND THAT, IF HE HAS TO SHARE POWER, IT WILL </p><p>ONLY BE BECAUSE OF HIS WEAKER RELIGIOUS CREDENTIALS (HE IS </p><p>NOT AN AYATOLLAH). </p><p> </p><p>(C)  PRESIDENT ALI HOSEINI KHAMENEI--LIKE RAFSANJANI, </p><p>KHAMENEI HAS BEEN ABLE TO SOLIDIFY HIS ACCESS TO THE </p><p>ELITES FROM HIS POSITION AS PRESIDENT.  WHEN RAFSANJANI </p><p>WANTED TO LIMIT THE POWER OF THE COMITEHS TO MAKE DECI- </p><p>SIONS WITHOUT CONSULTING HIGHER LEVELS OF THE GOI, </p><p>KHAMENEI SUPPORTED THE COMITEHS\' INDEPENDENCE, WHOSE MEM- </p><p>BERSHIP ARE NOT LIKELY TO FORGET HIS SUPPORT FOR THEM. </p><p> </p><p>(D)  AHMAD MUSAVI-KHOMEINI--AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI\'S SON IS </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE THE ONLY PERSON WITH UNLIMITED ACCESS TO </p><p>THE IMAM.  EVERY PERSON WHO CALLS ON THE AYATOLLAH MUST </p><p>FIRST BE "APPROVED" BY "GATEKEEPER" AHMAD BEFORE HE IS AL- </p><p>LOWED TO SEE KHOMEINI.  WHILE AHMAD RARELY FIGURES IN </p><p>IRANIAN HEADLINES, IT IS BELIEVED THAT SINCE HE KNOWS ALL </p><p>THAT HAS TRANSPIRED BETWEEN THE IMAM AND HIS GUESTS, HE </p><p>WILL BE ABLE TO USE THIS KNOWLEDGE TO ASSUME HIS PLACE IN </p><p>THE "GROUP OF FIVE."  IN ADDITION, SOME IRANIANS IN THE </p><p>MAJLIS HAVE REPORTEDLY VOICED THE CONCERN THAT "WE CAN </p><p>NEVER ALLOW THE NAME \'KHOMEINI\' TO FADE FROM OUR VIEW." </p><p>ONE WAY OF ASSURING THIS IS TO KEEP AHMAD IN THE UPPER </p><p>LEVELS OF THE GOI. </p><p> </p><p>(E)  AYATOLLAH ALI AKBAR MESHKINI--SPEAKER FOR THE "COUNCIL </p><p>OF EXPERTS," HE RARELY MAKES NEWS.  HOWEVER, IRANIANS WE </p><p>HAVE TALKED TO IN DUBAI BELIEVE THAT HE IS ORCHESTRATING </p><p>MUCH OF THE CONTINUED ANTI-WEST, ANTI-AMERICAN RHETORIC. </p><p>SINCE HE ALLEGEDLY HAD A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN HELPING TO </p><p>CHOOSE MONTAZERI AS THE IMAM\'S SUCCESSOR, THE DEBT MONTA- </p><p>ZERI OWES HIM MAY WELL BE REPAID WITH A POSITION IN THE </p><p>"GROUP OF FIVE." </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  THESE OBSERVATIONS ON THE "GROUP OF FIVE" </p><p>COME FROM IRANIANS WHOSE INFORMATION HAS PROVED TO BE RELI- </p><p>ABLE IN THE PAST.  WHILE MONTAZERI, RAFSANJANI, AND KHA- </p><p>MENEI ARE MOST OFTEN CITED IN ANY DISCUSSION OF POST- </p><p>KHOMEINI LEADERS, THE NAMES OF AHMED KHOMEINI AND MESHKINI </p><p>HAVE APPEARED OFTEN ENOUGH TO WARRANT THEIR INCLUSION. </p><p> </p><p>MACK </p><p></p></div>
