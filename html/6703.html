<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001769 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON WAR ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- The war on Iraq continues to dominate the Jordanian </p><p>press today, March 24.  Lead stories include wire </p><p>service reports under huge banner headlines depicting </p><p>"fierce battles and ferocious resistance" between the </p><p>Iraqis and the Coalition forces.  All papers highlight </p><p>the capture of American POWs on their front pages, and </p><p>include photos taken from television footage.  One </p><p>paper\'s banner headline reads "A day packed with </p><p>losses for the American and British forces".  Another </p><p>lead story highlights remarks made by Jordanian Prime </p><p>Minister, Ali Abul Ragheb, during a press conference </p><p>held yesterday.  The Prime Minister spoke about the </p><p>expulsion of three Iraqi diplomats from Jordan and </p><p>stressed that there are no military activities against </p><p>Iraq from Jordan.  The Prime Minister also declared </p><p>that the government of Jordan would launch "extensive </p><p>efforts" to stop the war. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Brutal American raids" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek writes on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(03/24):  "They [Americans] say that they are not </p><p>targeting the Iraqi people but Saddam Hussein.  If </p><p>this true, then why are they dropping thousands of </p><p>bombs on Iraq?  If they knew where Saddam Hussein was, </p><p>they would only need a single bomb, but the dropping </p><p>thousands of bombs is meant against the Iraqi people. </p><p>The point is that they [the Iraqi people] become </p><p>shocked and awed by the brutality of the American </p><p>bombing, a brutality never before witnessed by the </p><p>world.  This war is not a secret one.  The world is </p><p>following it live on their television screens..  This </p><p>public coverage has exposed the level of brutality and </p><p>blood-thirsty nature for shedding Arab blood and has </p><p>produced great anger in not only Arabs and Muslims but </p><p>also in every honorable human being with a sense for </p><p>what is going on in the world.  America is not </p><p>standing in the face of only the Iraqi people, but </p><p>also in the face of all the people of this world. </p><p>America has come to isolate Iraq, but instead has </p><p>isolated itself.  It has come to disarm the weapons of </p><p>mass destruction, but instead became the biggest user </p><p>of those weapons.  It has come to implement Security </p><p>Council resolutions, but instead ended up bypassing </p><p>the Council, ignoring its will and acted unilaterally. </p><p>This is not the third Gulf war.  It is rather the </p><p>second American-Arab war.  Does Bush now know that his </p><p>actions make up the answer to his question:  "Why do </p><p>they hate us?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "Is there not a joint Arab action?" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/24) editorializes:  "The fourth day of the </p><p>American war on Iraq was not one of the `happy days\' </p><p>for Washington and London.  The media confusion and </p><p>the conflicting stories exposing much false </p><p>information and lies about the battles and the size of </p><p>losses showed without a shadow of a doubt that what is </p><p>happening on the ground is completely different from </p><p>what the American and British spokespeople are saying </p><p>and promoting..  The images of children and innocent </p><p>victims in Basra shook the minds and hearts and </p><p>thwarted the `fairy tale of a clean war\' that </p><p>Washington had promoted.  Yet, if the United States </p><p>resorts to excessive use of power in the coming days, </p><p>it would likely make this war, which already lacks </p><p>legitimacy, the ugliest war.  Such developments and </p><p>fears strengthen the need to launch diplomatic and </p><p>political initiatives that would put an end to this </p><p>crazy war and would restore respect to diplomacy and </p><p>international legitimacy, which were destroyed as a </p><p>result of America\'s arrogance and Washington\'s </p><p>determination to beat the drums of war without any </p><p>consideration to the Security Council, the U.N. </p><p>Charter and calls of millions of human beings to stop </p><p>the war." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Where is international legitimacy?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/24):  "The dust of battles, bombings and military </p><p>confrontations must not suggest that the war is matter- </p><p>of-fact or that it enjoys legitimacy.  The reality is </p><p>that three countries, the United States, Britain and </p><p>Australia, have acted militarily, and without Security </p><p>Council authorization, to invade another country that </p><p>is a member of the United Nations..  If the United </p><p>Nations fails to stand up to the big aggressor, then </p><p>its role and moral credibility are as good as </p><p>finished.  The responsibility now lies on the </p><p>shoulders of the Secretary General, the Security </p><p>Council and member states.  If they choose to live in </p><p>a jungle led by the United States, then they can avoid </p><p>their duties now; but if they want to restore respect </p><p>to the United Nations, then they must perform their </p><p>role of condemning and rejecting the American invasion </p><p>and stress the illegality and illegitimacy of this </p><p>invasion." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Iraq steadfastness and American confusion" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Yaser Za\'atreh writes on the op-ed </p><p>page of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al- </p><p>Dustour (03/24):  "It is a sure thing that the </p><p>American and British forces are trying hard to avoid </p><p>striking against civilians and are striving to be </p><p>accurate in selecting their military targets, despite </p><p>the fact that a large number of civilians have fallen </p><p>victims.  This concern does not stem from any </p><p>compassion for the Iraqi people, rather from fear of </p><p>the repercussions of the Arab and international public </p><p>opinion..  It is also safe to say that the Iraqi </p><p>resistance was a surprise, not only for the Americans </p><p>but also for all observers.  The silliness of remarks </p><p>about the Iraqi desire to embrace and receive the </p><p>invaders with open arms is proven.  This is in </p><p>addition to the presence of rejection that is enough </p><p>to stir a confrontation that, in turn, would not give </p><p>the Americans an easy victory..  The invaders are </p><p>confused, and their confusion is making them make more </p><p>mistakes.  It might not stop the course of occupation, </p><p>but it will make it difficult.  History will write </p><p>that Iraq did not surrender, but resisted with all its </p><p>might at a time when regimes were watching with folded </p><p>arms or opening their lands for the invaders." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
