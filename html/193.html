<p>S E C R E T BAGHDAD 01181 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, IZ, IR, US </p><p>SUBJ:  IRAQ-IRAN WAR: ESCALATION OF THE WAR: NEED TO </p><p>PRESSURE IRAQ TO DE-ESCALATE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SECRET-ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p> </p><p>2.  NOW THAT THE WAR OF THE CITIES HAS RESUMED </p><p>(REGARDLESS OF WHO ACTUALLY STARTED IT), THE IRAQIS </p><p>APPEAR TO FEEL THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1980-81 </p><p>THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE OVER </p><p>IRAN.  ALTHOUGH UNDERSECRETARY HAMDOON ARGUED TO ME </p><p>YESTERDAY THAT IRAQ WANTS TO ASSURE MUTUAL DETERRENCE </p><p>AGAINST HITTING THE TWO CAPITALS, THE IRAQIS ARE </p><p>SHOWING NONE OF THE MEASURED RESPONSE SUCH A GOAL </p><p>WOULD IMPLY.  RATHER THEY HAVE FIRED NINETEEN </p><p>MISSILES TO DATE, NAMED BY THEM PROVOCATIVELY THE </p><p>"HUSSEIN" AFTER SHIA ISLAM\'S MOST HOLY FIGURE, AND, </p><p>EVEN MORE PROVOCATIVELY, HAVE FIRED THE LATEST ONE </p><p>AGAINST THE HOLY CITY OF QUM. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE IRAQIS SEE THIS STRATEGIC </p><p>ADVANTAGE AND ARE PRESSING IT HOME.  IF THEY HAVE </p><p>STOCKPILED A LARGE SUPPLY OF MISSILES (WE ASSUME </p><p>BUT DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY ARE SOVIET SS-12\'S), THEY </p><p>HAVE BADLY OUTGUNNED THE IRANIANS WHO HAVE ONLY A </p><p>LIMITED SUPPLY OF OBSOLETE, SLOW-RELOADING SCUD B\'S </p><p>WITH A FEW LAUNCHERS.  THE IRAQIS ALSO KNOW THAT THEY </p><p>HAVE AN ADVANTAGE ON THE GROUND.  IRAN IS NOT READY </p><p>FOR AN ALL-OUT OFFENSIVE IN THE SOUTH.  IF IT IS </p><p>GOADED TO ATTACK WITH WHAT THEY HAVE, THEY FACE </p><p>ALMOST CERTAIN DEFEAT AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A </p><p>STRONG COUNTER-ATTACK FROM IRAQ.  THE WINDOW FOR </p><p>ATTACKING IS RAPIDLY RUNNING OUT FOR IRAN, SINCE THE </p><p>PRIME WINTER IAPYJV  S PQMF AILL BE OVER BY THE </p><p>END OF THIS MONTH, HARDLY ENOUGH TIME EVEN IF A NEW </p><p>RECRUITING OF BASIJ STIMULATED BY THE MISSILE ATTACKS </p><p>BEGINS IMMEDIATELY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE IRAQ MOTIVE IN FORCING AN ESCALATION OF </p><p>THE FIGHTING IS CLEARLY TO MAKE IRAN GIVE UP ITS </p><p>WAR AIMS.  FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE INITIAL AIR </p><p>RAIDS ON KHARG ISLAND THREE YEARS AGO, IRAQ SENSES </p><p>THAT IT REALLY HAS THE ABILITY TO FORCE AN END TO </p><p>HOSTILITIES, RATHER THAN JUST TO REACT.  UNDER THESE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS NOT LIKELY TO LISTEN TO APPEALS </p><p>TO EASE OFF. </p><p> </p><p>5.  OUR CONDEMNATION OF BOTH SIDES FOR ATTACKING </p><p>CIVILIAN TARGETS WAS JUST RIGHT.  I BELIEVE THAT, IF </p><p>THE ATTACKS GO ON ANOTHER DAY, WE SHOULD GO BEYOND </p><p>THE CONDEMNATION AND PRASS IRWY TT BE-ESCALATE.  I </p><p>AM NOT SANGUINE THAT THEY WILL LISTEN, SINCE THEY </p><p>SEE A VITAL OPPORTUNITY AND THEIR RECORD FOR LISTENING </p><p>TO OUR UNWELCOME ADVICE IS NOT ENCOURAGING.  BUT IN </p><p>THE INTEREST OF OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A QUICK </p><p>PEACEFUL END TO THIS CONFLICT AND ABOVE ALL TO </p><p>AVOID THE DANGERS OF AN INTENSIFIED WAR, I BELIEVE </p><p>WE SHOULD MAKE THE EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>NEWTON </p><p></p></div>
