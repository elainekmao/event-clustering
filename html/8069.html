<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003190 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBED, EB/ESC, NEA/NGA, IO, EUR/SE </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, ETTC, GG, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES PIPELINES, BOT PROJECTS WITH </p><p>ENERGY MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 2953 B) ANKARA 3036 C) 2997 (BTC) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Robert Pearson, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  Energy Minister Guler reiterated to </p><p>Ambassador May 13 his personal commitment to completing BTC </p><p>construction on time in Turkey, and thanked Ambassador for </p><p>his reassurance that U.S. support for BTC had not decreased </p><p>with the change in Iraq.  Ambassador requested GOT support </p><p>for the sanctions lift resolution, noting that passage of the </p><p>resolution would allow the oil from the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik </p><p>pipeline to be sold again.  Ambassador asked for the </p><p>Minister\'s help in resolving the dispute with U.S. BOT power </p><p>plant investors Doga and Trakya, emphasizing the importance </p><p>of a quick resolution to the U.S., particularly to OPIC and </p><p>ExIm, which had roughly USD 500 million invested in these </p><p>projects.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Ambassador began his May 13 meeting with Energy </p><p>Minister Guler by congratulating him on resolving the </p><p>outstanding management issues relating to construction of the </p><p>BTC pipeline in Turkey (ref C).  Guler emphasized that he was </p><p>personally following the project, and would ensure that the </p><p>pipeline was completed on time.  Ambassador also reiterated </p><p>continued U.S. support for BTC, noting that rumors that our </p><p>support had decreased with recent changes in Iraq and that </p><p>the U.S. was promoting a Kirkuk-Haifa pipeline were </p><p>unfounded.  Guler said he was happy to hear this directly </p><p>from the Ambassador; he did not believe U.S. support had </p><p>changed, but now he could more authoritatively answer </p><p>reporters, questions on this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Kirkuk-Yumurtalik and Sanctions </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Turning to the status on the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik </p><p>pipeline, which the GOT has raised with us previously (ref </p><p>B), Ambassador noted that the northern oil fields and the </p><p>pipeline were in good shape.  He said, the U.S. -- like </p><p>Turkey -- wanted to get the oil flowing again, but first U.N. </p><p>sanctions must be lifted.  Ambassador requested GOT support </p><p>for the sanctions lift resolution, the passage of which would </p><p>allow oil from the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline to be sold </p><p>again.  Guler said he would pass the request to the GOT </p><p>leadership, adding that quick resumption of the oil flow from </p><p>Iraq would be a "nice gesture" by the U.S. after our recent </p><p>bilateral problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BOT Projects </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador raised the current dispute involving the </p><p>U.S. build-operate-transfer (BOT) power plant investors Doga </p><p>Energi (Edison Mission) and Trakya Elektrik (Enron) (ref A). </p><p>He stated that the U.S. companies felt they were being forced </p><p>to make unilateral changes to their contracts, adding that </p><p>this atmosphere was not conducive to successful negotiations. </p><p> Ambassador noted that the U.S. government agencies OPIC and </p><p>ExIm Bank had invested roughly USD 500 million in these two </p><p>projects, and thus the U.S. had a strong interest in seeing </p><p>the current dispute resolved as soon as possible.  He pointed </p><p>out that the GOT knew from the earlier arrearages dispute </p><p>involving these same companies that OPIC would aggressively </p><p>defend its investment.  The U.S. also had an interest in the </p><p>continued, long-term participation of U.S. companies in </p><p>Turkey\'s energy sector.  Ambassador asked for the Minister\'s </p><p>help in resolving this issue during the May 14-16 visit of </p><p>OPIC, ExIm and the other export credit agencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Minister Guler responded that, although he believed </p><p>there were "irregularities" in these BOT contracts, he was </p><p>not pursuing a prejudiced approach toward the companies and </p><p>he was surprised they felt this way.  He said he believed the </p><p>irregularities were likely the fault of the Turkish partners, </p><p>not the foreign investors.  Guler pointed out that Turkey </p><p>simply could not afford to purchase electricity at 11-12 </p><p>cents per kilowatt hour from the BOTs when the world average </p><p>was closer to 4-5 cents per kilowatt hour.  With electricity </p><p>prices 3 times the world average, there was no way Turkey </p><p>could attract foreign investment, nor could its firms\' </p><p>products compete internationally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Guler said he believed that a contract was a contract, </p><p>which was why he had approached the companies to ask for a </p><p>"gesture" on their part, but the companies had refused.  He </p><p>said he had not gone to the press as some politicians might </p><p>have; rather, he had asked the companies several times in </p><p>private meetings if they would be open to renegotiating the </p><p>contracts.  Since the companies had refused to renegotiate, </p><p>he was now looking at the government\'s rights as a party to </p><p>the contracts.  Guler said he believed there were four </p><p>possible outcomes:  1) the contracts continue to be </p><p>implemented as is; 2) the contracts are canceled; 3) the GOT </p><p>buys out the companies; and 4) the parties enter into </p><p>international arbitration.  He said the Ministry of Energy </p><p>was reviewing all four options for each of the BOTs; they </p><p>would not be treated as a group.  Guler told the Ambassador </p><p>he would try to assure the companies that he was pursing a </p><p>positive approach, that he was only considering solutions </p><p>allowed by the contracts, and that he would seek a resolution </p><p>agreeable to all parties. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Electricity Prices and IMF Commitments </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador asked how the Minister planned to reconcile </p><p>his commitment to cut electricity prices with the GOT\'s </p><p>commitment to the IMF in the recent Letter of Intent to </p><p>increase electricity prices.  The Minister responded that the </p><p>Ministry of Energy had recently implemented several important </p><p>cost-saving measures, including shutting down the expensive </p><p>mobile power plants and moving to more hydro power, and </p><p>stopping the Blue Stream gas flow for six months as allowed </p><p>for the in the GOT\'s contract with the Russians.  The GOT had </p><p>also cancelled its contract to import electricity from </p><p>Bulgaria because the Bulgarians had not held up their end of </p><p>the bargain by giving priority to Turkish companies for </p><p>certain projects.  These steps had resulted in a USD two </p><p>million per day savings to Turkey. Guler said the Ministry of </p><p>Energy (MENR) had argued to Treasury that these savings </p><p>compensated for not raising electricity prices in 2003. </p><p>Treasury technicians were now working with MENR technocrats </p><p>to confirm their calculations. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
