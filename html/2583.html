<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000776 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR SIGNALS THAT </p><p>OBASANJO WILL RUN IN 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) President Obasanjo\'s Senate Liaison Officer </p><p>Kashim Imam told reporters March 5 at the National Assembly </p><p>that President Obasanjo will run in 2003 because "there is no </p><p>credible alternative to him." Imam added, "not only will he </p><p>run on the strength of our achievements, but also he will be </p><p>reelected because he has performed." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) According to PDP National Youth Director Ibrahim Sidi </p><p>Bamailli, Imam made his statement after the Presidential </p><p>Villa learned of a move led by House Speaker Na \'Abba for </p><p>several Representatives to send a joint missive to the PDP </p><p>leadership opposing Obasanjo as the party\'s Presidential </p><p>candidate in 2003. By making this pronouncement, they hoped </p><p>to place Obasanjo on the defensive, Bamailli maintained. If </p><p>he announced his candidacy after their action, he would be </p><p>viewed as the one splitting the party, the Na\'Abba group </p><p>felt. However, because many in this rival group were abroad </p><p>for the Hajj, the decision to send the statement was never </p><p>finalized. The Presidency decided that Imam should preempt </p><p>the mavericks by making a pro-Obasanjo statement before they </p><p>could re-assemble. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) During a March 5 breakfast meeting, Lino Adesanya, a </p><p>Lagos-based businessman with close contacts in the PDP, </p><p>confirmed to Ambassador Jeter that party rebels have been </p><p>seriously caucusing about making a public statement opposing </p><p>Obasanjo before he formally announces his reelection decision. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment : Imam\'s statement may be part reiteration, </p><p>part preemptive strike.  Presidential advisors periodically </p><p>make statements that Obasanjo will run again, preserving </p><p>their boss\'s flexibility on the question. Works Minister </p><p>Anenih\'s "there is no vacancy in the Villa" remark last year </p><p>was the most famous and set the tone.  While Obasanjo may </p><p>still be mulling over his choices, some advisors publicly </p><p>have lent their voices to the reelection option in hopes of </p><p>influencing Obasanjo and to remind the public that Obasanjo </p><p>has not decided against running. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: The timing of Imam\'s statement also may have </p><p>been influenced by news of the rebel group\'s intentions. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s people understand that the player who punches last </p><p>usually gets called for the foul. They may have felt it </p><p>important to strike first so that Na\'Abba and company will be </p><p>perceived as undermining party unity should they make an </p><p>anti-Obasanjo statement close on the heels of Imam\'s positive </p><p>one.  The choice of Imam, son of a major political figure in </p><p>Nigerian political history, was likely intended to stem </p><p>growing Northern opposition to a second Obasanjo term.  In </p><p>that regard, it will have little effect. While Imam\'s </p><p>statement may have prevented the Na\' Abba group\'s flanking </p><p>action this time, the battle has just started. Other </p><p>skirmishes between Obasanjo friends and foes are certain. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
