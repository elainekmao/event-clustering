<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L THE HAGUE 001926 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR KHARTOUM EMBASSY OFFICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/28/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, ETTC, SU, NL, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: SUDAN/UNSC: DUTCH BELIEVE THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS </p><p>ON THOSE PROPOSING TO LIFT SANCTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 121045 </p><p>     B. SECSTATE 117658 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by A/Polcouns Eric Lundberg, Reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(C) Responding to ref A demarche on 6/26, Dutch MFA UN </p><p>Political Affairs expert Marjolijn van Deelen told A/Polcouns </p><p>that the Dutch would look skeptically upon a UNSC resolution </p><p>calling for the lifting of sanctions on Sudan.  According to </p><p>Van Deelen, the burden of proof lies with those who maintain </p><p>Sudan is complying with UNSCR 1044.  The MFA, she said, would </p><p>study the ref B non-paper forwarded last week, but was prone </p><p>to agree with Washington that Khartoum had not done enough to </p><p>rein in terrorist group present in Sudan.  Along these lines, </p><p>Van Deelen said that the Dutch would be interested in a </p><p>readout of the ongoing U.S.-Sudan talks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Addressing Cairo\'s softened stance toward Khartoum, Van </p><p>Deelen was curious why the U.S. appraisal of Egyptian </p><p>terrorist groups EIJ and Al-Gama\'at al-Islamiyya differed </p><p>with Egypt\'s.  A/Polcouns countered that Cairo\'s policy was </p><p>based on its assessment of its own interests, which may or </p><p>may not take into account the existing threat to U.S. or </p><p>European interests, nor the language of UNSCR 1044. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Reviewing the Secretary\'s oral message, Van Deelen </p><p>quibbled only with an apparent parallel drawn between lifting </p><p>sanctions and rehabilitation of Sudan.  The lifting of </p><p>sanctions, she stressed, should be pegged to Sudanese </p><p>compliance with UNSCR 1044, she said.  Rehabilitation, </p><p>however, should come only with Khartoum\'s improved behavior </p><p>in a variety of areas in addition to terrorism, namely human </p><p>rights and the peace process. </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
