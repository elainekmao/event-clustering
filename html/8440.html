Following multiple trouble-shooting visits with WFP and </p><p>Ministry of Trade teams in the upper south region of Iraq, </p><p>the DART Field Team West Food Officer believes the public </p><p>distribution system is prepared to meet June distribution </p><p>expectations.  Upcoming visits to Al Muthanna and Wasit </p><p>Governorates are planned to monitor distribution progress. </p><p>DART cooperative-agreement partner CARE visited Al Hillah on </p><p>29 May to share its proposed water and sanitation </p><p>implementation plans, including a proposal to make emergency </p><p>repairs on a water treatment system in Al Hillah that serves </p><p>750,000 people. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DART Field Team West conducted a follow-up visit on 28 </p><p>May to a mass gravesite near Al Hillah to observe exhumation </p><p>processes, meet with a new human rights organization, and </p><p>update civil-military officers.  Civil Affairs (CA) officers </p><p>in Al Hillah reported on 27 May that a local newspaper </p><p>reporter was bludgeoned to death allegedly by a pro-Saddam </p><p>group that left a note warning locals against working with </p><p>the Coalition.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>3.  Progress on several public distribution system (PDS) </p><p>issues in Al Hillah are nearing resolution.  Once resolved, </p><p>the DART believes that the June distribution will be more </p><p>efficient.  The DART has facilitated an arrangement between </p><p>the civil-military operations center (CMOC) security </p><p>representatives and the Ministry of Trade (MOT) silo and </p><p>warehouse management to include MOT security personnel in a </p><p>four-day police and security guard training program.  The </p><p>MOT has prepared the list of names of its personnel and will </p><p>submit the list to the CMOC.  It is hoped that some of the </p><p>MOT security guards will be included in the 1 June class. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The DART has arranged for the CMOC to review a MOT </p><p>inventory list of missing or damaged items at the warehouse </p><p>facility for possible replacement.  According to the CMOC, </p><p>the validated items would be replaced or repaired. </p><p>Coalition forces had occupied portions of the warehouse </p><p>grounds until about 10 days ago. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The DART has notified the CMOC that some MOT warehouse </p><p>personnel have not received their USD 20 emergency payments. </p><p>CMOC will begin distributions of the USD 20 payments as soon </p><p>as MOT submits its list. </p><p> </p><p>6.  The DART has arranged for the issuance of a letter from </p><p>a Coalition commander in Babil Governorate to the MOT silo </p><p>manager stating that silo management has the authority to </p><p>purchase spare parts without requesting approval from the Al </p><p>Hillah governor\'s office.  This authority will expedite any </p><p>repairs needed during food arrivals and deliveries at the </p><p>silo, thus preventing work stoppage during high volume </p><p>periods. </p><p> </p><p>7.  As reported previously, the Governorates of Babil, </p><p>Karbala, An Najaf and Al Qadisiyah are prepared for the </p><p>planned 1 June start date for the June food distribution, </p><p>although some ration shortages exist.  As of 29 May, U.N. </p><p>World Food Program (WFP) national and international staff in </p><p>Al Hillah were awaiting instructions from WFP\'s leadership </p><p>detailing specific distribution start dates and the planned </p><p>release of ration commodities.  The DART plans to visit </p><p>Samawah, Al Muthanna Governorate on 31 May and Al Kut, Wasit </p><p>Governorate early next week, to better determine their food </p><p>distribution status.  The trip to Al Kut will serve as a </p><p>follow-on visit to that made by DART/South the week of May </p><p>19, when it was learned that PDS preparations were clearly </p><p>behind the other southern governorates and concerns about </p><p>aflatoxin levels in the wheat currently in the silos were </p><p>raised.  The DART has no new information on PDS status in Al </p><p>Anbar Governorate, particularly in the Ar Ramadi area. </p><p> </p><p>8.  WFP/Al Hillah said public announcements on local </p><p>television have announced that non-registered public- </p><p>distribution system beneficiaries should go to the </p><p>registration center in Al Hillah and register for the June </p><p>ration. </p><p> </p><p>9.  A recent 28,000 metric ton (MT) delivery of Russian </p><p>wheat (pre-war Oil for Food commodities) arrived in </p><p>Al Hillah during the last five days.  According to an Al </p><p>Hillah MOT silo manager, the wheat is old and probably not </p><p>suitable for human consumption.  WFP said the MOT silo lab </p><p>personnel would test the wheat to determine its quality. </p><p> </p><p>10.  WFP/Al Hillah is preparing a final stock list to </p><p>determine actual shortages of ration items.  In An Najaf, </p><p>WFP said it was short 750 MT of rice and 300 MT of vegetable </p><p>oil for the June ration. Pipeline deliveries of those two </p><p>items were expected soon, but actual delivery dates were not </p><p>available. </p><p> </p><p>11.  A Civil Military Operations Center (CMOC) </p><p>representative said there was a growing concern among </p><p>farmers in An Najaf over the lack of information on plans to </p><p>purchase the local harvest.  She said a clear plan from WFP </p><p>or the Grain Board would go far in alleviating growing </p><p>tensions.  The DART is trying to attain a schedule from the </p><p>Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance. </p><p> </p><p>12.  WFP/An Najaf said it has been requested by WFP/Basrah </p><p>to identify additional wheat-grain storage space.  The silo </p><p>manager in An Najaf believes he has found the required </p><p>additional space. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>AN NAJAF HEALTH SECTOR </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  Various Ministry of Health (MOH) employees met at the </p><p>CMOC in An Najaf on 28 May to complain about the An Najaf </p><p>Minister of Health, who has served as minister for the past </p><p>11 years.  They say he is corrupt and that he forces many </p><p>MOH workers to carry out fraudulent activities.  As a </p><p>result, the Coalition authorities will likely consider </p><p>postponing the election for the An Najaf Minister of Health </p><p>scheduled for 31 May. </p><p> </p><p>14.  According to the Coalition civil affairs health officer </p><p>in An Najaf, the General Hospital suffers from the city\'s </p><p>sporadic electrical power.  There is a 15-minute delay from </p><p>the time the city\'s power shuts down to the time the </p><p>hospital\'s generator starts, causing potential emergencies </p><p>in the operating room, in incubators, and for other patients </p><p>relying on electrical medical equipment. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>CARE </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>15.  The largest water treatment system (WTS) in Al Hillah </p><p>that serves 750,000 people is perilously close to failing </p><p>with three of six pumps in its primary pumping station down </p><p>and three pumps in poor condition.  The DART visited the </p><p>system on 30 May with cooperative agreement partner CARE, </p><p>which has submitted a plan to make emergency repairs on the </p><p>pumps and other failing or failed parts of the system. </p><p> </p><p>16.  The WTS optimally produces 130,000 cubic meters of </p><p>water per day.  CARE said it now runs at about 16 percent of </p><p>capacity.  Sporadic electricity in Al Hillah also affects </p><p>output.  The system can run a maximum of 20 hours per day, </p><p>although its backup generator can only perform for six hours </p><p>straight.  The other two WTSs in Al Hillah produce 16,000 </p><p>and 22,000 cubic meters per day.  CARE rehabilitated both of </p><p>these smaller systems in 2001. </p><p>Other non-functional elements at the plant are the flush </p><p>mixers, the six flocculaters, and two of four backwash </p><p>pumps.  Ninety of 160 filter valves are not working.  The </p><p>chlorinator is weak, but is currently operable.  Regarding </p><p>chlorine availability, a CARE water engineer warned that </p><p>there could be a shortage of chlorine in Iraq in two months </p><p>because the current stocks are not being replaced. </p><p>Additionally, CARE proposes to carry out the following water </p><p>and sanitation projects: </p><p> </p><p>--  Clear the blocked sewage system in the Maternity and </p><p>Pediatric Hospital in Al Hillah; </p><p> </p><p>--  Improve water supply in Khanaqin, Diyala; </p><p> </p><p>--  Remedy a serious sewage problem in Kamilya, Baghdad; </p><p> </p><p>--  Increase water capacity at two water treatment plants in </p><p>Qadissiya and one in Dorah, both in Baghdad; </p><p> </p><p>--  Repair four sewage pumping stations in Hay Saddam, </p><p>Baghdad; </p><p> </p><p>--  Rehabilitate water networks in Muqdadiya and Baquba, </p><p>Diyala; Anah and Hit in Al Anbar; and Hamza and Mahaweel, </p><p>Babil; </p><p> </p><p>--  Increase capacity at the old and new water treatment </p><p>plants in Muqdadiya, Diyala; and </p><p> </p><p>--  Make emergency repairs on a compact water unit and a </p><p>sewage pumping station damaged in the war in Central </p><p>Baghdad. </p><p> </p><p>17.  CARE reported that it was in the procurement stage of </p><p>its ongoing implementation plan for Al Anbar Governorate, </p><p>carrying out water-supply repairs in Ar Rutbah and Al </p><p>Qa\'im.  The Ar Rutbah project requires five generators, and </p><p>Al Qa\'im needs a chlorinator and boosting pumps.  All heavy </p><p>equipment is being procured in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>UPDATES FROM THE GOVERNORATE SUPPORT TEAM MEETING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>18.  The DART learned on 30 May at the Al Hillah GST meeting </p><p>that six truckloads of medicines arrived from Kimadiya- </p><p>Baghdad, the MOH drug distributor, to Al Hillah\'s MOH drug </p><p>warehouse on 27 May.  A truckload of medical supplies was </p><p>expected on 28 May.  Also reported at the meeting was that </p><p>40 tons of liquid propane gas was due to arrive in Al Hillah </p><p>everyday for five days.  It was unclear when the initial </p><p>shipment would come.  Al Hillah normally requires 100 tons </p><p>per day.  The LPG pipeline, barring breakages, should be </p><p>running in three weeks.  The Civil Affairs officer dealing </p><p>with security issues said that 260 new police officers </p><p>completed a four-day police training, and that 130 more </p><p>would be on the streets every four to five days following </p><p>completion of their trainings. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>BABIL PROTECTION ISSUES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  On 25 May, a local Al Hillah independent newspaper </p><p>office was attacked and a reporter bludgeoned to death by a </p><p>group calling itself the "The Knights of Saddam Hussein." </p><p>According to the Al Hillah CMOC, this was the only unbiased </p><p>newspaper in town.  The reporter was beaten to death and a </p><p>note was pinned on him that stated anyone cooperating with </p><p>the Coalition would be killed.  All the newspaper\'s </p><p>reporters and printing press workers have quit as a result </p><p>of this attack.  Local Iraqi translators for the Coalition </p><p>have also begun to be threatened, especially while at the </p><p>interim city hall where the CMOC and GST are </p><p>based.  None of the translators will identify who is </p><p>intimidating them for fear they or their families would be </p><p>harmed. </p><p> </p><p>20.  The DART visited a mass grave northwest of Al Musayyib, </p><p>Babil on 28 May with representatives from the Office of </p><p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance and USAID.  The </p><p>group also visited the youth center, which has been </p><p>converted into a morgue. </p><p> </p><p>21.  Thus far, over 600 bodies have been exhumed by the </p><p>community, including six women and one child.  According </p><p>to the local site supervisor, approximately 100 to 200 </p><p>bodies are being dug up everyday.  When asked if the local </p><p>digging crew needed any equipment for volunteer diggers, the </p><p>site supervisor gratefully declined and said what </p><p>they really wanted was a forensics team to begin proper </p><p>exhumations of the remaining bodies buried in the mass </p><p>grave.  A British forensics team previously visited the site </p><p>and will begin forensics investigations on the areas of the </p><p>site that have not been unearthed. </p><p> </p><p>22.  Exhumations by the local community continue to be </p><p>relatively organized.  After exhumation, all bodies are </p><p>identified either by identification cards or by clothing and </p><p>personal effects.  They are then taken to the youth center, </p><p>added to existing rosters and laid out for </p><p>families to identify.  While the DART was at the </p><p>youth center, three bodies were identified by family </p><p>members, including a woman whose husband was killed in </p><p>1991. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>NEW HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP IN AN NAJAF </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>23.  The DART also met on 28 May with the An Najaf-based </p><p>organization Human Rights for Iraq that was created by An </p><p>Najaf lawyers after the war.  The organization has 20 </p><p>members (two women) and its director is a candidate in the </p><p>upcoming mayoral election in An Najaf. </p><p> </p><p>24.  The Deputy Director said there are six identified mass </p><p>graves in the An Najaf area with an estimated 5,000 to </p><p>10,000 victims buried in them.  He suspects there are more. </p><p>His agency helped locate the gravesites, attempts to </p><p>identify bodies, and tries to provide care for the victims\' </p><p>families.  In addition to mass-grave activities, Human </p><p>Rights for Iraq does landmine removal and awareness.  The </p><p>Deputy Director would like to put landmine-awareness </p><p>announcements on An Najaf\'s television station, but has not </p><p>been successful in convincing the station\'s staff to do </p><p>so. </p><p> </p><p>25.  Other agency objectives include: the protection of </p><p>basic human rights, promotion of freedom of opinion, and the </p><p>collection and destruction of weapons in An Najaf, and </p><p>ideally working with the Coalition military.  The Human </p><p>Rights for Iraq\'s office is located in central An Najaf in </p><p>the Center for High Studies, a division of Kufa University. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>DART VISIT TO AN NAJAF COURTHOUSE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>26.  The DART visited the courthouse in An Najaf on 28 May. </p><p>The courthouse was looted and its records destroyed during </p><p>the time between the departure of the former regime and the </p><p>entry by Coalition forces.  Records were systematically </p><p>burned, causing considerable damage to the building </p><p>interior, though not destroying it.  Most of the furniture, </p><p>air conditioners, and fixtures were looted or damaged. </p><p>Electricity and plumbing need extensive replacement.  The </p><p>building is in reparable condition, but will require </p><p>considerable work. </p><p> </p><p>27.  Judges held elections last week and are currently </p><p>hearing a limited number of cases in the adjoining Juvenile </p><p>Court that was less damaged.  The DART met all of the </p><p>sitting judges as well as Coalition forces working to assist </p><p>in rebuilding the judiciary system in An Najaf.  They all </p><p>agree that the current courthouse should be </p><p>repaired, in the first instance because it is economically </p><p>viable, and second as a sign to the residents of An Najaf </p><p>that the judiciary suffered in the past, but its spirit has </p><p>been resurrected and the legal system is functioning to </p><p>benefit civil society. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
