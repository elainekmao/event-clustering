STATE 144906 </p><p>     B. STATE 139892 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 1025 </p><p>     D. ABUJA 989 </p><p>     E. ABUJA 905 </p><p>     F. ABUJA 552 </p><p>     G.

(C) During a June 11 meeting with President Obasanjo on </p><p>Article 98 and security assistance issues (SEPTEL), </p><p>Ambassador Jeter explained the ramifications of not </p><p>concluding an Article 98 agreement by the July 1 deadline. </p><p>Obasanjo said he was in favor of Article 98.  He thought </p><p>such agreements were necessary to "protect" Nigerian </p><p>soldiers and commented that Nigeria would "not participate </p><p>in peacekeeping" operations without such agreements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) These statements indicate that Obasanjo is thinking </p><p>differently than some of his former Ministers.  Former </p><p>Minister of Defense Danjuma told DCM June 7 that the inter- </p><p>ministerial committee set up to examine Article 98 opposed </p><p>the agreement (REF C).  During the Ambassador\'s </p><p>conversation with the President, however, Obasanjo seemed </p><p>uninformed about the inter-ministerial committee\'s </p><p>recommendation.  Also, there was some confusion amongst the </p><p>advisors present as to whether the inter-ministerial </p><p>committee had actually met. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: Obasanjo\'s support for an Article 98 </p><p>agreement is welcome but it does put him at odds with many </p><p>of his advisors.  Thus, this matter may not be settled </p><p>despite the strong indication given by Obasanjo in his </p><p>meeting with the Ambassador.  During a private aside at </p><p>that meeting, Ambassador Jeter mentioned to Obasanjo that </p><p>Danjuma had said Nigeria would follow South Africa\'s lead </p><p>and not sign Article 98 (REF C AND D).  Obasanjo retorted </p><p>that Nigeria was sovereign and would make its own decisions </p><p>based on its interests, not South Africa\'s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: In the final analysis, </p><p>Obasanjo\'s meeting with this ad-hoc committee or his </p><p>reaction to its report (should the meeting already have </p><p>taken place but not yet reported to Obasanjo) will likely </p><p>determine if Nigeria signs an Article 98 agreement.  While </p><p>it would not be unprecedented for the Obasanjo to disregard </p><p>the counsel of his advisors if he has his own strong </p><p>convictions about an issue, it is too soon to predict.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
