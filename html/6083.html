<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 000588 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, ECON, EAID, AORC, CA, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN VIEWS ON WSSD IMPLEMENTATION AND CSD </p><p>REFORM </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 41673 </p><p> </p><p>1. As requested in reftel, EST Counselor provided U.S. </p><p>discussion papers, talking points and Q and A paper to the </p><p>Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International </p><p>Trade (DFAIT) and to the GOC coordinating committee on WSSD </p><p>implementation.  Returning from an extended absence, our </p><p>main interlocutor in the GOC, Gary Pringle (DFAIT), told EST </p><p>Counselor that Canada is generally supportive of the </p><p>approach to CSD reform being proposed by the U.S.  He found </p><p>the Q and A paper particularly helpful in presenting the </p><p>case for some of the reform measures being proposed. </p><p>However, he indicated that the GOC is now focused on the CSD </p><p>Secretariat\'s paper of February 14 and would be interested </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>in USG comments on that paper. </p><p> </p><p>2. Pringle said the GOC would like to see future sessions of </p><p>the CSD address topics on the basis of "WEHAB Plus," which </p><p>he described as perhaps two topics pre-selected from the </p><p>WEHAB agenda and one topic selected from among other </p><p>competing areas of interest to CSD participants.  He noted </p><p>in particular that Canada thought the topics of "sustainable </p><p>cities" and "information technology" should be on future CSD </p><p>agendas for consideration, even though they were not </p><p>contained in the WEHAB formulation. </p><p> </p><p>3. Furthermore, Canada plans to propose that a review be </p><p>built into the revised CSD agenda after the first cycle (two </p><p>years).  This would allow participants to evaluate the </p><p>effectiveness of changes adopted and to make whatever </p><p>adjustments, large or small, may be called for. </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
