The groundwork for peace talks was laid with the </p><p>Government of Nepal reportedly sending a formal invitation </p><p>to the Maoists.  The Maoists announced their five-member </p><p>negotiating team for talks with the GON.  Human rights </p><p>organizations want the peace talks to focus on human rights </p><p>and creating a lasting peace in Nepal. UNICEF declared the </p><p>truce a ray of hope for children in Nepal and criticized the </p><p>Maoists "politicization" of the educational sector.  Narayan </p><p>Singh Pun, Minister For Physical Planning and Works and </p><p>government appointed negotiator, said that the priority of </p><p>the peace talks would be humanitarian issues and announced </p><p>plans to visit some of the districts hit hardest by the </p><p>insurgency.  The United Kingdom announced its plans to </p><p>continue military assistance to Nepal.  Criminal cases filed </p><p>against top Maoists are on hold, while some districts began </p><p>releasing suspected Maoists from prison.  Security personnel </p><p>arrested three journalists working for a pro-Maoist </p><p>newspaper.  An indefinite closure of educational </p><p>institutions, set to begin on February 13, has been called </p><p>off by the pro-Maoist student union.  Maoists killed a </p><p>police officer and are still forcibly collecting money from </p><p>villagers. </p><p> </p><p>GROUNDWORK FOR PEACE TALKS BEGINS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  According to local press reports, the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) sent an official invitation to the Maoists for </p><p>formal peace talks.  The press also reported that the </p><p>Maoists acknowledged the invitation and were expected to </p><p>accept it. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Dr. Baburam Bhattarai, the Maoists\' number-two leader, </p><p>will head a five-member team in peace talks with the GON. </p><p>In addition to Bhattarai, the team consists of four other </p><p>senior-level Maoists: military strategist Ram Bahadur Thapa </p><p>(aka "Badal"); Dev Gurung; Krishna Bahadur Mahara, who </p><p>participated in the 2001 negotiations; and Mitrika Prasad </p><p>Yadav.  The Maoists issued a statement through the local </p><p>press that there should be no suspicions about the ceasefire </p><p>and assured wary mainstream politicians that they believed </p><p>the role of political parties in the peace talks "cannot be </p><p>ignored." </p><p> </p><p>4.  According to local press reports, Narayan Singh Pun, </p><p>Minister For Physical Planning and Works and appointed </p><p>government coordinator for the negotiations, has already </p><p>held informal talks with Maoist leader Dr. Baburam Bhattarai </p><p>at an undisclosed location (According to a senior police </p><p>official, Bhattarai left India after the ceasefire and is </p><p>now in Nepal).  The informal meetings allegedly were held to </p><p>establish a code of conduct and agenda for peace talks. </p><p> </p><p>PEACE TALKS TO ADDRESS HUMANITARIAN ISSUES </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) appealed to </p><p>the GON and the Maoist party to turn the ceasefire into </p><p>lasting peace.  In separate letters to Prime Minister Chand </p><p>and Maoist leader Pushpa Dahal (aka "Prachanda"), the NHRC </p><p>said that the ceasefire would be meaningless if it did not </p><p>allow the people of Nepal to resume normal lives.  NHRC also </p><p>stressed the need for both sides to commit publicly to the </p><p>ceasefire and to establish a code of conduct for the period </p><p>of the ceasefire.  The NHRC offered to help draft a letter </p><p>of understanding for both sides to sign. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Amnesty International (AI) issued a statement on </p><p>February 1 appealing to both the GON and the Maoists to give </p><p>top priority to human rights issues when peace dialogue </p><p>begins.  AI urged both sides to "make human rights an </p><p>integral part of the agenda," and to enact measures that </p><p>would prevent any future killings, abductions and torture by </p><p>either side.  AI also called on the Maoists to return all </p><p>children recruited as soldiers to their homes. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of UNICEF, said the </p><p>ceasefire has provided a ray of hope for children in Nepal. </p><p>Bellamy urged all sides to make schools a zone of peace and </p><p>to put women and children at the center of the peace talks. </p><p>Bellamy criticized the apparent trend of politicising </p><p>schools, and said it is "unacceptable" that schools have not </p><p>been able to provide a safe haven for children. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The National Women\'s Commission (NWC) released a study </p><p>on February 6 detailing the sexual abuse against female </p><p>Maoists.  The NWC study reported that the women were often </p><p>sexually harassed and exploited by male insurgents.  Several </p><p>of the sexual assaults resulted in pregnancies, and some </p><p>women were later forced to give birth in caves.  The NWC </p><p>visited several districts in the mid and far western regions </p><p>of Nepal and found that women were often subjected to </p><p>repeated rapes by as many as six different men.  The NWC </p><p>said it would ask the government to investigate and treat </p><p>the women, many of whom claimed to have been framed, as </p><p>prisoners of conscience. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Narayan Singh Pun, Minister For Physical Planning and </p><p>Works, said that the priority of the peace talks would be </p><p>humanitarian issues.  Pun told the local press that </p><p>thousands of people had been left in a vulnerable state </p><p>because of the insurgency, and that he planned on visiting </p><p>some of the worst-hit districts. </p><p> </p><p>UK TO CONTINUE MILITARY AID TO NEPAL </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  The British Government welcomed the ceasefire between </p><p>the GON and the Maoists as an "important and positive </p><p>development." Despite the ceasefire, however, Britain </p><p>announced that it would continue providing military </p><p>assistance to Nepal.  The announcement follows a weeklong </p><p>visit to Nepal by a British mission consisting of senior </p><p>officials from the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Defense and </p><p>Department of International Development.  Members of the </p><p>commission told the local press that the focus would mainly </p><p>be on training the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA), but would also </p><p>address Nepal\'s development and its civilian police </p><p>capabilities.  Britain contributes almost fourteen million </p><p>dollars annually in bilateral assistance to Nepal and also </p><p>provides over four million dollars each fiscal year to the </p><p>Global Conflict Prevention Pool, which funds short-term </p><p>development projects. </p><p> </p><p>CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST MAOISTS IN LIMBO; </p><p>PRISONERS RELEASED </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  On January 13 the Government of Nepal (GON) filed </p><p>special court cases against ten senior Maoist leaders, </p><p>including Pushpa Dahal (aka Prachanda) and Dr. Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai, accusing them of being the "chief perpetrators of </p><p>crimes against the state" and demanded life imprisonment for </p><p>the Maoists (Ref A).  The status of these cases is now </p><p>unclear with the announcement of the ceasefire.  According </p><p>to local press reports, the GON has not withdrawn the cases, </p><p>and the court will not dismiss them until it receives </p><p>something in writing from the GON.  In its attempt to bring </p><p>the Maoists to the table for peace talks, the GON had </p><p>withdrawn the rewards offered for information leading to </p><p>their arrests and reportedly cancelled "red corner notices" </p><p>on them with Interpol. </p><p> </p><p>12.  On January 31 Minister Pun visited the Central Jail and </p><p>the jail at Hanuman Dhoka in Kathmandu, where he met with </p><p>imprisoned Maoists.  The GON is considering the possible </p><p>release of information on the whereabouts of Maoists </p><p>currently in jail.  The local press reported that Pun has </p><p>reassured Maoist leaders that all detained Maoists will be </p><p>released within a month.  It is estimated that there are </p><p>currently 9,000 suspected Maoists imprisoned throughout the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>13.  The District Administration in southwestern Dang </p><p>District, a Maoist stronghold, has begun releasing Maoists </p><p>from prison.  Eight Maoists were released from Tulsipur Jail </p><p>on orders of the government and, according to the </p><p>superintendent of police, more would be released after </p><p>processing is completed.  In northwestern Baglung District, </p><p>six suspected Maoists were released from jail after being </p><p>imprisoned for over a year under the Terrorist and </p><p>Destructive Acts legislation.  A journalist and two teachers </p><p>arrested under the same act remain in jail.  Four others </p><p>serving time on suspicion of being Maoists were also </p><p>released from Central Jail on orders of the Supreme Court. </p><p>In southern Rautahat District, security forces released a </p><p>secondary school teacher who had been in custody for </p><p>fourteen months on charges of participating in Maoist </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The editor of Janadisha, a newspaper considered to be </p><p>the mouthpiece of the Maoists, and two other journalists </p><p>from the same newspaper were arrested February 1 under the </p><p>Public Security Act.  Authorities had previously raided </p><p>Janadisha\'s offices after the imposition of the state of </p><p>emergency in November 2001 and arrested the staff. </p><p> </p><p>ANNISU-R WITHDRAWS CALL FOR EDUCATION STRIKE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  The All Nepal National Independent Students Union- </p><p>Revolutionary (ANNISU-R) withdrew its call for an indefinite </p><p>closure of schools (Ref B).  The strike was set to begin on </p><p>February 13.  Devendra Parajuli, President of ANNISU-R, said </p><p>he believed that the militant students\' demands could be met </p><p>through dialogue, and said the country\'s focus right now </p><p>should be on "resolving the current political crisis." </p><p> </p><p>CEASEFIRE DOESN\'T STOP VIOLENCE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  Maoists killed a police officer in Kanchanpur District. </p><p>His body was discovered on January 30, just a day after the </p><p>announced ceasefire.  The officer had been abducted by the </p><p>insurgents and held captive for almost two weeks. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Maoists in mid-western Arghakhanci District are still </p><p>forcibly soliciting donations from villagers despite the </p><p>ceasefire.  Farmers and small business owners report being </p><p>compelled to donate money to the insurgents.  A senior </p><p>police official claims that Maoists in Kathmandu Valley are </p><p>forcing residents to attend political indoctrination </p><p>meetings.  Maoist insurgents also declared a general strike </p><p>in southern Makwanpur District on February 4, putting a halt </p><p>to businesses, traffic and schools. </p><p> </p><p>18.  The Maoist Party issued a press release on February 5 </p><p>denying that it had been involved in any acts of theft or </p><p>looting since the declaration of the ceasefire.  The </p><p>statement follows a number of thefts and robberies allegedly </p><p>carried out in the name of the Maoists in southern </p><p>Nawalparasi District. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
