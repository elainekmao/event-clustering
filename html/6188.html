<p>UNCLAS HANOI 000554 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL/AAE; EAP/BCLTV; UNVIE FOR FISHER AND BARMON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, PREL, EAID, VM, CNARC </p><p>SUBJECT:  UNODC CONCERN OVER VIETNAM FUNDING </p><p> </p><p>REF:    02 Hanoi 2979 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action request - see paragraph 8. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  UNODC country representative Dr. Doris Buddenberg </p><p>contacted poloff on March 6 to express concern over </p><p>Department\'s decision to reprogram USD 740,000 originally </p><p>intended to fund UNODC\'s law enforcement project </p><p>"Interdiction and Seizure Capacity Building with Special </p><p>Emphasis on ATS and Precursors."  Embassy continues to </p><p>support the project, while understanding the apparent need </p><p>for more urgent programming elsewhere.  As a fallback, </p><p>Embassy would support the suggestion of  using USD 500,000 </p><p>intended for the now moribund Song Ma project for this law </p><p>enforcement project. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Vietnam continues to face numerous challenges </p><p>regarding the drug and crime situation, including: (1) the </p><p>lack of financing resources for technical drug control and </p><p>crime prevention activities; (2) the possible re-emergence </p><p>of opium poppy cultivation; (3) growing drug trafficking and </p><p>consumption problems; (4) rising crime concerns connected to </p><p>drugs, such as corruption, money-laundering and trafficking </p><p>in persons; and (5) restrictive internal policies regarding </p><p>the sharing of drug intelligence information with foreign </p><p>counterparts. </p><p> </p><p>  4. (U)  Within the UNODC country program for Vietnam, law </p><p>enforcement has always been - with support from the USG - an </p><p>important component of drug control.  Through law </p><p>enforcement projects such as this one, the UN and donor </p><p>agencies are in regular contact with the Ministry of Public </p><p>Security (MPS).  This allows foreign agencies to chip away </p><p>at one of the toughest problems in dealing with Vietnam\'s </p><p>drug problems - developing a cooperative counternarcotics </p><p>relationship with MPS.  Without a significant improvement in </p><p>MPS cooperation with foreign law enforcement agencies, this </p><p>project can serve as a useful conduit for better access to </p><p>information and influence on decision-making, thus helping </p><p>UNODC to implement the multifaceted approach to drug control </p><p>as envisaged by the UNODC mandate and the UN Conventions on </p><p>drug control, especially the UN Convention of 1988.  With </p><p>increased training, GVN law enforcement agencies should also </p><p>become more aware of issues such as human rights, </p><p>international dimension of criminal and drug activities, </p><p>international cooperation, and mutual legal assistance. </p><p>With the US-Vietnam counternarcotics agreement still </p><p>pending, contributions to UNODC\'s Vietnam projects are a </p><p>cost-effective way of advancing the mission\'s and USG\'s </p><p>counternarcotics and law enforcement goals. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Significantly, the project document includes a </p><p>provision on drug profiling, where GVN authorities agree to </p><p>heroin profiling being conducted by partner laboratories </p><p>abroad.  While the profiling is linked to heroin only in </p><p>this project, it opens the door for future cooperation in </p><p>other drug categories, such as ATS.  This activity will </p><p>enable law enforcement authorities to have a better idea </p><p>from where seized heroin is coming.  The GVN has been </p><p>extremely reluctant to cooperate with such profiling on a </p><p>bilateral basis. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Action request:  Embassy requests that INL consult </p><p>with UNODC headquarters and favorably consider funding the </p><p>UNODC project with the USD 500,000 available from Song Ma or </p><p>from other available sources. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
