<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 OTTAWA 001383 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN PNORMAN AND EB/DCT </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA GWARD AND CBUSQUETS </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR SCHANDLER </p><p>DEPT ALSO PASS FDA DAUTOR AND MECKLES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EIND, CA, Manitoba, Trade </p><p>SUBJECT: INTERNET PHARMACIES: MANITOBA LEADS THE WAY IN </p><p>EXPORTS TO THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL: 2002 OTTAWA 2048 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY - WITH STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND REGULATOR, MANITOBA HAS BECOME A HUB FOR </p><p>THE GROWING CROSS-BORDER TRADE IN PHARMACEUTICALS FROM </p><p>CANADA TO THE U.S.  CANADIAN INTERNET PHARMACIES, SOME OF </p><p>WHICH FILL MORE THAT 1000 PRESCRIPTIONS A DAY, HAVE BEEN </p><p>SUCCESSFUL IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE DISPARATE U.S. AND </p><p>CANADIAN MARKET PRICES FOR PHARMACEUTICALS AND LEGAL </p><p>UNCERTAINTIES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER.  MANITOBA\'S </p><p>STRONG PROMOTION OF THE INDUSTRY IS IN STARK CONTRAST </p><p>WITH THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH TAKEN BY OTHER PROVINCES, </p><p>ESPECIALLY ONTARIO.  THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY WILL </p><p>DEPEND ON THE INTERNET PHARMACIES\' ABILITY TO RESPOND TO </p><p>THE INCREASING PRESSURE ON THE SUPPLY OF PHARMACEUTICALS </p><p>AND NAVIGATE THE MURKY LEGAL AND ETHICAL WATERS </p><p>SURROUNDING THE TRADE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--PHARMACEUTICAL EXPORTS - A BOON FOR MANITOBA-- </p><p> </p><p>2. MANITOBA HAS BECOME A MAJOR HUB IN A GROWING TRADE IN </p><p>PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS FROM CANADA TO THE U.S., </p><p>MUCH OF WHICH IS NOW ORDERED OVER THE INTERNET AND </p><p>FULFILLED BY MAIL.  MANITOBA-BASED INTERNET PHARMACIES </p><p>ACCOUNT FOR WELL OVER HALF OF THE ESTIMATED USD 500 </p><p>MILLION WORTH OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SOLD TO THE U.S. FROM </p><p>CANADA LAST YEAR.  THE MANITOBA PHARMACEUTICAL </p><p>ASSOCIATION (MPA), WHICH REGULATES PHARMACIES IN THE </p><p>PROVINCE, ESTIMATES THAT 53 MANITOBA PHARMACIES ARE </p><p>INVOLVED IN CROSS-BORDER TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>THE INDUSTRY HAS CREATED UPWARDS OF 2000 JOBS IN TOWNS </p><p>THROUGHOUT THIS TRADITIONAL MANUFACTURING AND FARMING </p><p>PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>3. KRIS THORKELSON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF CANADA DRUGS, ONE </p><p>OF THE LARGEST INTERNET PHARMACIES IN MANITOBA, INVITED </p><p>MISSION PERSONNEL FOR A TOUR OF THE COMPANY\'S FACILITIES </p><p>TO HELP DEMONSTRATE THAT THE NEW INTERNET PHARMACIES ARE </p><p>NOT "FLY BY NIGHT" OPERATIONS, AND THAT THEY HAVE </p><p>INVESTED HEAVILY IN BRICKS AND MORTAR, AS WELL AS </p><p>SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER AND ELECTRONIC TRACKING SYSTEMS. </p><p>CANADA DRUGS FILLS OVER 1000 PRESCRIPTIONS A DAY, ALL FOR </p><p>EXPORT TO THE UNITED STATES.  CUSTOMERS INITIATE AN ORDER </p><p>BY FAXING OR MAILING TO CANADA DRUGS A COPY OF THEIR U.S. </p><p>PRESCRIPTION, TOGETHER WITH A POWER OF ATTORNEY FORM THAT </p><p>WAIVES THE CANADIAN PHARMACIST OF LIABILITY, AND A </p><p>PATIENT QUESTIONNAIRE.  AN IN-HOUSE PHARMACIST AT CANADA </p><p>DRUGS REVIEWS MATERIALS, A CANADIAN PHYSICIAN CO-SIGNS </p><p>THE PRESCRIPTION, AND THE PHARMACIST REVIEWS IT A SECOND </p><p>TIME AFTER A TECHNICIAN FILLS THE ORDER, AND ONCE MORE </p><p>BEFORE IT IS SHIPPED OUT.  EACH ORDER IS CONFIRMED BY </p><p>PHONE WITH THE CUSTOMER BEFORE IT IS SENT.  CANADA DRUGS </p><p>HAS 18 PHARMACISTS ON STAFF, OVER 40 PHARMACEUTICAL </p><p>TECHNICIANS, AND APPROXIMATELY 170 STAFF IN TOTAL. </p><p> </p><p>--PROVINCE STEPPING IN TO SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY-- </p><p> </p><p>4. THE GOVERNMENT OF MANITOBA (GOM) IS A STRONG SUPPORTER </p><p>OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL EXPORT INDUSTRY AND VIEWS THE NEW </p><p>BUSINESSES AS A KEY COMPONENT OF ITS PROVINCIAL GROWTH </p><p>STRATEGY.  EXPORTS FROM CANADA STILL ONLY ACCOUNT FOR </p><p>LESS THAN ONE-HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF THE U.S. </p><p>PRESCRIPTION DRUG MARKET.  THE GOM IS WORKING WITH THE </p><p>MPA AND THE MANITOBA COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS </p><p>(MCPS) ON SMOOTHING OUT THE REGULATORY PROCESS TO </p><p>LEGITIMIZE THE INDUSTRY.  AS FAR AS THE GOM IS CONCERNED, </p><p>EXPORTING PHARMACEUTICALS TO THE U.S. IS NOT ILLEGAL </p><p>UNDER CANADIAN LAW, AND THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN </p><p>ENFORCING U.S. PROHIBITIONS ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IF </p><p>THE FDA WILL NOT ENFORCE THEM.  THE GOM IS INSTEAD </p><p>FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT THE PRACTICE IS SAFE, MEETS </p><p>CANADIAN FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES, </p><p>AND THAT INTERNET PHARMACIES PROVIDE U.S. CONSUMERS WITH </p><p>THE SAME SAFEGUARDS AND LEVEL OF SERVICE AS CANADIAN </p><p>CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p>5. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS FOR THE PROVINCIAL </p><p>REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ACROSS CANADA HAS BEEN THE </p><p>PRACTICE OF CANADIAN PHYSICIANS CO-SIGNING, OR RE-WRITING </p><p>PRESCRIPTIONS FOR U.S. PATIENTS THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN. </p><p>REGULATORS HAVE QUESTIONED WHETHER SIGNING OFF ON </p><p>PRESCRIPTIONS WITHOUT PERFORMING AN APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL </p><p>EXAMINATION IS TANTAMOUNT TO PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT. </p><p>THE MPA HAS WORKED WITH THE MCPS TO CLAMP DOWN ON THE </p><p>MOST EGREGIOUS CASES WHERE PHYSICIANS WERE "RUBBER </p><p>STAMPING" MORE THAN 1000 PRESCRIPTIONS A DAY.  DESPITE </p><p>THESE CONCERNS, THE MPA, THE MCPS, AND MANITOBA\'S </p><p>INTERNET PHARMACIES RECENTLY SIGNED OFF ON A GOM PLAN TO </p><p>ELIMINATE CO-SIGNING BY A CANADIAN PHYSICIAN ALTOGETHER </p><p>AND TO ACCEPT PRESCRIPTIONS FROM U.S. PHYSICIANS ON PAR </p><p>WITH THOSE FROM CANADA.  THE GOM IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE </p><p>THEIR PROPOSAL SHORTLY AND SEEK THE NECESSARY LEGISLATIVE </p><p>CHANGES TO DO AWAY WITH CO-SIGNING IN THE FALL.  THE </p><p>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL LIKELY CHALLENGE THIS PROVINCIAL </p><p>LEGISLATION. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE STRONG PROMOTION OF THE INDUSTRY FROM MANITOBAN </p><p>OFFICIALS IS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH </p><p>OF OTHER PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS.  ONTARIO </p><p>HAS TAKEN THE STRONGEST STANCE AGAINST INTERNET </p><p>PHARMACIES, QUESTIONING BOTH THE LEGITIMACY OF THE CROSS- </p><p>BORDER TRADE IN PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS AND THE </p><p>ABILITY OF THE PROVINCIAL REGULATORS TO EFFECTIVELY </p><p>MONITOR THE SALE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SOUTH OF THE </p><p>BORDER.  THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS OF </p><p>ONTARIO, THE SELF-REGULATING BODY FOR THE PROVINCE\'S </p><p>MEDICAL PROFESSION, HAS STATED THAT "IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE </p><p>FOR A PHYSICIAN TO SIGN OR CO-SIGN A PRESCRIPTION WITHOUT </p><p>ATTENDING THE PATIENT."  THE ONTARIO COLLEGE OF </p><p>PHARMACISTS HAS ALSO WEIGHED IN STATING THAT PHARMACISTS </p><p>"SHALL NOT FACILITATE OR ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH </p><p>PHYSICIANS FOR THE PURPOSES OF CO-SIGNING OR REWRITING </p><p>PRESCRIPTIONS FOR OUT-OF-COUNTRY PATIENTS."  IN JUNE THE </p><p>ONTARIO COURTS WILL HEAR A CASE AGAINST A NUMBER OF </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS WITH AN ONLINE </p><p>PHARMACY, THE CANADIAN DRUG STORE INC., WHICH IS ACCUSED </p><p>OF UNLAWFULLY OPERATING AN UNACCREDITED INTERNET PHARMACY </p><p>AND FILLING PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN BY U.S. PHYSICIANS FOR </p><p>U.S. PATIENTS. </p><p> </p><p>--CLOUDS LOOMING OVER THE INDUSTRY-- </p><p> </p><p>7. DESPITE THE INDUSTRY\'S RECENT GROWTH, THE ENORMOUS </p><p>POTENTIAL FOR LOWER-PRICED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE U.S. </p><p>MARKETPLACE, AND STRONG SUPPORT FROM GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>REGULATORY OFFICIALS, THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF THE </p><p>CROSS-BORDER INTERNET PHARMACEUTICAL TRADE IS TENUOUS. </p><p>IN ADDITION TO A POSSIBLE CRACKDOWN ON IMPORTERS BY THE </p><p>FDA OR A LEGISLATIVE FIX BY CONGRESS TO PROVIDE SENIORS </p><p>WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE, THERE ARE SEVERAL </p><p>DOMESTIC FACTORS THAT COULD SEVERELY DAMAGE THE CANADIAN </p><p>INDUSTRY. </p><p> </p><p>8. BRITISH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURER GLAXOSMITHKLINE </p><p>(GSK), WHICH ANNOUNCED IN JANUARY THAT THEY WOULD NO </p><p>LONGER SUPPLY THEIR PRODUCTS TO CANADIAN PHARMACIES </p><p>SELLING TO THE U.S. MARKET, IS APPLYING THE GREATEST </p><p>PRESSURE.  PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURES ARE CONCERNED THAT </p><p>THE GROWING CROSS-BORDER TRADE COULD LEAD TO A NUMBER OF </p><p>PROBLEMS: SHORTAGES OF BOTH CANADIAN PHARMACISTS AND DRUG </p><p>PRODUCTS FOR CANADIAN CONSUMERS, DRUGS UNAPPROVED IN THE </p><p>U.S. BEING DISPENSED TO U.S. PATIENTS, INFRINGEMENT OF </p><p>U.S. PATENTS, AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR CANADIAN DRUG </p><p>COMPANIES.  IN PRIVATE WE HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT FOR </p><p>THE FIRST TIME COMPANIES HAVE EXPERIENCED DECREASED SALES </p><p>OF KEY DRUGS IN NORTHERN BORDER STATES. </p><p> </p><p>9. KRIS THORKELSON FROM CANADA DRUGS ADMITTED THAT </p><p>SUPPLIES OF SOME GSK DRUGS ARE STARTING TO RUN SHORT. </p><p>THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SECURE SUPPLIES THROUGH </p><p>OTHER CANADIAN PHARMACIES, BUT IS BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE </p><p>DELAYS AND IS CONCERNED THAT THEY MAY NO LONGER BE ABLE </p><p>MEET THE DEMAND.  EFFORTS BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL EXPORTERS </p><p>TO COUNTER GSK\'S ACTIONS WERE DERAILED WHEN CANADA\'S </p><p>FEDERAL COMPETITION BUREAU RULED IN MARCH THAT GSK HAD A </p><p>"REASONABLE BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION" TO BLOCK THE EXPORTS. </p><p>ASTRAZENECA\'S RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WILL LIMIT </p><p>SUPPLIES OF THEIR PRODUCTS TO CANADIAN PHARMACIES AND </p><p>WHOLESALERS HAS COMPOUNDED THE SUPPLY PROBLEMS FOR </p><p>INTERNET PHARMACIES. </p><p> </p><p>10. A RELATED, AND YET UNTESTED, QUESTION IS HOW FEDERAL </p><p>AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS WILL REACT IF THE DEMAND FROM </p><p>INTERNET PHARMACIES BEGINS TO AFFECT THE SUPPLY OF DRUGS </p><p>TO TRADITIONAL PHARMACIES SERVING CANADIAN PATIENTS.  THE </p><p>GOM IS PROMOTING A "MANITOBA FIRST" POLICY TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>MANITOBANS ARE NOT DENIED ACCESS TO DRUGS IF THERE IS A </p><p>SHORTAGE, BUT THE POLICY LACKS THE REGULATORY TEETH THAT </p><p>WOULD FORCE PHARMACIES TO SELL TO THE MANITOBA MARKET. </p><p>FEDERAL REGULATIONS DO NOT STIPULATE THAT PHARMACIES MUST </p><p>MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF DRUGS OR COMPEL THEM TO </p><p>GIVE FIRST PRIORITY TO CANADIAN CONSUMERS.  BOTH HEALTH </p><p>CANADA AND INDUSTRY CANADA ARE MONITORING THE CANADIAN </p><p>DRUG SUPPLY AND HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD INTERVENE </p><p>IN EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES, AS THEY DID WHEN THERE WAS A </p><p>RUN ON CIPRO DURING THE ANTHRAX SCARE IN 2001. </p><p> </p><p>11. PROVINCIAL EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE PHARMACEUTICAL </p><p>EXPORT INDUSTRY ARE ALSO BEING CLOSELY WATCHED BY THE </p><p>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  PROVINCIAL REGULATORS SET AND </p><p>ENFORCE THE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR PHYSICIANS AND </p><p>PHARMACISTS, BUT HEALTH CANADA, THROUGH THE HEALTH ACT </p><p>AND FOOD AND DRUG ACT, IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>SAFETY OF FOODS, DRUGS AND HEALTH PRODUCTS.  IN A RECENT </p><p>MEETING WITH USG OFFICIALS, DAVID EDWARDS, LEGAL COUNSEL </p><p>AT HEALTH CANADA, NOTED THAT ACCORDING TO THE HEALTH ACT, </p><p>A "PRACTITIONER" MUST BE A CANADIAN, AND THAT IT WOULD </p><p>NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE GOM TO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR A </p><p>CANADIAN DOCTOR TO CO-SIGN A PRESCRIPTION BEFORE IT COULD </p><p>BE FILLED BY A CANADIAN PHARMACIST. </p><p> </p><p>--COMMENT- </p><p> </p><p>12. DEPENDING ON WHOM ONE SPEAKS WITH AND THEIR RELATION </p><p>TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, BI-NATIONAL TRADE IN </p><p>PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS IS EITHER A MARKET WITH HUGE </p><p>GROWTH POTENTIAL FOR RURAL CANADIAN COMMUNITIES, OR A </p><p>LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE BUSINESS THAT HAS ACHIEVED TEMPORAL </p><p>SUCCESS ARBITRAGING GAPS IN REGULATIONS AND PRICES.  THE </p><p>LEGAL FRAMEWORK SURROUNDING THE CROSS-BORDER TRADE HAS </p><p>NOT BEEN SOLIDIFIED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BORDER, AND </p><p>UNTIL IT IS MANY OF THE ISSUES WILL REMAIN OPEN TO </p><p>INTERPRETATION.  OTHER PROVINCES ARE PAYING CLOSE </p><p>ATTENTION TO DEVELOPMENTS IN MANITOBA TO SEE HOW THE </p><p>INTERNET BUSINESS MODEL WILL RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE </p><p>MARKETPLACE AND WHAT IMPACTS THIS MAY HAVE FOR THE </p><p>CANADIAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI# </p><p></p></div>
