<p>S E C R E T ROME 003382 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, IT, NATO, ESDP </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY ON AUGUST 29 ESDP MEETING </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ROME 3368 B) PARIS 5097 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/POL MINISTER COUNSELOR GARY ROBBINS  REASON: 1.5 (B)(D </p><p>) </p><p> </p><p>GUIDANCE REQUEST - SEE PARA 5 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)     ON JULY 23, MFA CFSP COORDINATOR AND EUROPEAN </p><p>CORRESPONDENT SANDRO DEBERNARDIN BRIEFED POLOFF ON </p><p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE AUGUST 29 ESDP MEETING DISCUSSED </p><p>REFTELS.  THERE HAD BEEN SOME THOUGHT TO HOLDING THE MEETING </p><p>AT MINISTERS, LEVEL, AND THAT IS STILL A POSSIBILITY, BUT IT </p><p>IS MORE LIKELY THAT POLDIRS FROM THE 25 EXISTING AND NEW EU </p><p>MEMBER STATES WILL BE INVITED TO ROME TO DISCUSS EUROPEAN </p><p>SECURITY ISSUES, INCLUDING PROGRESS ON THE EUROPEAN SECURITY </p><p>STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  ACCORDING TO DEBERNARDIN, THE IDEA FOR THE MEETING </p><p>WAS GENERATED AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITHIN THE MFA, INCLUDING </p><p>WITH FM FRATTINI, ON THE BEST METHOD FOR DEALING WITH THE </p><p>PROPOSALS FROM THE FOUR-NATION APRIL 29 MINI-SUMMIT.  THE </p><p>ITALIAN PRESIDENCY WANTS TO "BUILD A BRIDGE" BETWEEN THE FOUR </p><p>AND THE REST OF THE EU AND "TAKE THE POISON OUT OF" THE </p><p>BRUSSELS DOCUMENT.  THE PRESIDENCY WANTS TO MAKE USE OF THE </p><p>POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THE MINI-SUMMIT CONCLUSIONS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>NEED FOR EUROPE TO DEVELOP CAPABILITIES AND A RAPID REACTION </p><p>FORCE, AND TO ELIMINATE SUPPORT FOR HARMFUL INITIATIVES IN </p><p>THE DOCUMENT SUCH AS ESTABLISHING A SEPARATE HEADQUARTERS FOR </p><p>ESDP. </p><p></p><p>3.  (C)  THE GOI FULLY AGREES WITH U.S. VIEWS THAT </p><p>BERLIN-PLUS MUST REMAIN THE FOUNDATION OF THE DISCUSSIONS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO DEBERNARDIN, THE BRUSSELS-FOUR SUPPORT THE </p><p>ITALIAN INITIATIVE FOR THE AUGUST MEETING, AND HE IS </p><p>OPTIMISTIC THAT A WAY CAN BE FOUND TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS </p><p>WITHOUT ESTABLISHING A SEPARATE HEADQUARTERS.  DEBERNARDIN </p><p>WOULD LIKE THE U.S. TO HELP, QUIETLY, IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS </p><p>GOAL, AND ASKED FOR OUR POINTS/INPUT AS ITALY PLANS FOR THE </p><p>MEETING DURING THE AUGUST BREAK. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S/NOFORN)  REQUESTING NOT TO BE QUOTED, DEBERNARDIN </p><p>(STRICTLY PROTECT) OPINED THAT FURTHER PUBLIC CRITICISM BY </p><p>THE US ON THE MINI-SUMMIT DOCUMENT COULD BE HARMFUL AND </p><p>JEOPARDIZE THESE ATTEMPTS AT COMPROMISE; IT COULD CAUSE THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE FOUR TO DIG IN THEIR HEELS ON THE HQ ISSUE. </p><p>POLOFF POINTED OUT THAT THE PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE </p><p>ESDP HQ FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE BERLIN-PLUS AGREEMENTS ON </p><p>NON-DUPLICATION, AND THE U.S. WOULD CONTINUE TO CRITICIZE </p><p>SUCH PROPOSALS WHENEVER THEY ARE RAISED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  COMMENT AND GUIDANCE REQUEST.  THE GOI IS MAKING A </p><p>GOOD FAITH ATTEMPT TO KEEP THE DEBATE ON ESDP AT 15(25), </p><p>WHERE IT BELONGS, AND WHERE US VIEWS HOLD GREATER SWAY.  POST </p><p>STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT WE TAKE DEBERNARDIN UP ON HIS OFFER </p><p>TO CONTRIBUTE (QUIETLY, IN ROME) TO THE PROCESS, WITH IDEAS </p><p>FOR THE AUGUST 29 MEETING\'S CONCLUDING DOCUMENT THAT ADDRESS </p><p>THE  PERCEIVED NEED FOR A SEPARATE ESDP HQ.  COUNCIL </p><p>SECRETARIAT DG ROBERT COOPER ALLUDED TO THE PROBLEM DURING </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE JULY 18 POLDIRS\' TROIKA (REF A)  WHEN HE SAID THAT SHAPE </p><p>DOES NOT YET FUNCTION AS A PLATFORM FOR BERLIN PLUS AND </p><p>PLANNING FOR EU OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>2003ROME03382 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
