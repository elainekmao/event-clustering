<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002296 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND C WILKINSON </p><p>USAID FOR MARJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EFIN, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  Zimbabwe Exporters May Bear Heavier Burden </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Zimbabwe\'s Reserve Bank will soon propose </p><p>measures that would further punish the country\'s </p><p>exporters, increasing an indirect revenue tax from 37 to </p><p>47 percent.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Embassy has acquired the Reserve Bank\'s </p><p>Foreign Exchange Task Force report, the GoZ\'s latest </p><p>attempt to address its foreign currency shortfall.  We </p><p>understand the working paper will soon move to the </p><p>Finance Ministry for vetting.  The paper advocates </p><p>stricter fiscal and monetary restraint, but its more </p><p>specific prescriptions are either counterproductive or </p><p>too meek to have an impact. </p><p> </p><p>The indirect export tax </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>3. (SBU) The plan would raise from 40-to-50 percent the </p><p>portion of revenue subject to mandatory conversion at the </p><p>official rate.  At present, exporters must exchange 40 </p><p>percent of earnings at this rate, which is just one- </p><p>fifteenth of the parallel rate.  The exchange requirement </p><p>amounts to a crippling 37 percent indirect tax on </p><p>revenue, not profit, in addition to Zimbabwe\'s more </p><p>conventional taxes and royalties.  For example, it means </p><p>Zimbabwean gold miners earn just US$ 175/ounce versus a </p><p>world price of US$ 318.  Plagued by this comparative </p><p>disadvantage, exporters -- the country\'s traditional </p><p>forex earners -- have already cut production to bare </p><p>bones.  The new plan would raise this exchange rate "tax" </p><p>from 37 to 47 percent. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) In addition, the plan would: </p><p> </p><p>- increase the exchange rate for imported luxuries from </p><p>300-400 percent, raising by one-third the value subject </p><p>to import duties.  (Many Zimbabweans purchase cars while </p><p>in South Africa.) </p><p> </p><p>- offer to sell Zimdollars to expatriate Zimbabweans as </p><p>well as Harare\'s diplomatic missions at a 320:1 rate. </p><p>(The USG has been buying Zimdollars in the U.S. at </p><p>860:1.) </p><p> </p><p>- restrict foreigners to fuel purchases at designated gas </p><p>stations.  (Foreign truckers frequently enter Zimbabwe to </p><p>load up on heavily-subsidized fuel.) </p><p> </p><p>- advocate a fuel conservation campaign.  (The paper </p><p>suggests that "there might be a need to adjust tariffs.") </p><p> </p><p>- suspend non-essential foreign travel for GoZ and </p><p>parastatal officials. </p><p> </p><p>- lease some of Air Zimbabwe\'s planes.  (The managing </p><p>director tells us that the airline, once slated for </p><p>privatization, has lost 30 percent of capacity since </p><p>2000.) </p><p> </p><p>- reduce Zimbabwe\'s foreign missions. </p><p> </p><p>- scale down GoZ shares in several parastatals (without </p><p>relinquishing a controlling interest). </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. (SBU) The proposal to raise the exchange requirement </p><p>indicates that the GoZ still believes it can print, tax </p><p>and expropriate its way to larger revenues.  While </p><p>several other measures gingerly challenge official </p><p>policy, there are no bold recommendations for floating </p><p>exchange rates, dollarized accounts, unsubsidized fuel or </p><p>genuine privatizations.  Saddled with steeper indirect </p><p>taxes, exporters will likely produce even less.  The GoZ </p><p>ends up with a larger slice of a smaller pie and no </p><p>appreciable balance-of-payments or forex gains. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) This is reason for concern in a country whose </p><p>export and manufacturing sectors are crumbling.  Since </p><p>the late-1990s, tobacco exports -- once tops in the world </p><p>-- may be down from US$ 400 to 105 million by next year; </p><p>gold mining falling 29 to just 14 tonnes; manufacturing </p><p>off 34 percent.  In spite of this tumble, the Reserve </p><p>Bank paper suggests that statist solutions still dominate </p><p>GoZ thinking, probably dashing hopes that the 2003 budget </p><p>will bring relief to producers. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
