SUMMARY: </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>THE LEAD STORY IN ALL PRO-GOVERNMENT MEDIA WAS </p><p>PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S INTERVIEWS WITH CNN\'S LARRY KING </p><p>AND THE BBC.  ALL PRO-GOVERNMENT HEADLINES EMPHASIZED </p><p>MUBARAK\'S RENEWAL OF THE CALL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONFERENCE ON FIGHTING TERRORISM; HIS URGING THAT AN </p><p>AMERICAN ATTACK ON ANY COUNTRY BECAUSE OF A SINGLE </p><p>PERSON MEANS THE KILLING OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS; AND HIS </p><p>STATEMENT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH PROMISED FURTHER EFFORTS </p><p>TO SETTLE THE MIDDLE EAST ISSUE; THAT THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION IS CERTAINLY AFFILIATED WITH </p><p>BIN LADEN. </p><p> </p><p>HOWEVER, THE BANNER IN OPPOSITION AL AHRAR READ, "WE </p><p>WILL NOT FIGHT WITH AMERICA," IN REFERENCE TO PRESIDENT </p><p>MUBARAK\'S STATEMENT THAT EGYPTIAN TROOPS WILL NOT </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN AN AMERICAN ATTACK IN AFGHANISTAN.  AL </p><p>AHRAR\'S FRONT PAGE FURTHER PUBLISHED A STORY THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH "IS TRYING TO SAVE HIS FRAGILE ALLIANCE" </p><p>BY MEETING WITH WORLD LEADERS ON THE PLANS TO RESPOND </p><p>TO THE ATTACKS IN THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>PROMINENT REPORTS ON PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO THE </p><p>ISLAMIC CENTER IN WASHINGTON APPEARED IN LEADING PRO- </p><p>GOVERNMENT AL AHRAM AND AGGRESSIVE PRO-GOVERNMENT AL </p><p>AKHBAR. </p><p> </p><p>-- ON ALL FRONT PAGES, PRESIDENT MUBARAK DISCUSSED THE </p><p>AMERICAN SITUATION WITH JORDAN\'S KING ABDULLAH, SYRIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT ASSAD AND OMAN SULTAN QABOOS. </p><p> </p><p>-- LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT AL AHRAM\'S FRONT PAGE </p><p>PROMINENTLY REPORTED THAT THE UNSC DEMANDED THE TALIBAN </p><p>SURRENDER BIN LADEN, WHILE THE U.S. FORMED "A WAR </p><p>GOVERNMENT" WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH AND SECRETARY POWELL </p><p>ARE CONDUCTING A DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN TO FORM AN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE AGAINST TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>-- LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT AL AHRAM QUOTED SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL\'S PRESS CONFERENCE SAYING THAT THE U.S. DOES NOT </p><p>INTEND HARM TO THE AFGHANI PEOPLE, AND BIN LADEN HAS </p><p>CELLS IN DOZENS OF COUNTRIES.  ALL PAPERS COVERED HIS </p><p>STATEMENT TO AL JAZIRA TELEVISION RULING OUT ISRAEL\'S </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE AMERICAN MILITARY RESPONSE AND </p><p>THAT THE ARAB WORLD IS NOT A TARGET OF AMERICAN ACTION </p><p>TO FIGHT TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>-- ALL FRONT PAGES REPORTED ON THE KILLING OF AN </p><p>EGYPTIAN COPT IN LOS ANGELES AS A REACTION TO THE </p><p>ATTACKS IN THE U.S.  COLUMNISTS CONTINUED TO CRITICIZE </p><p>THE "HATE CAMPAIGN" AGAINST ARABS AND MOSLEMS </p><p>WORLDWIDE. </p><p> </p><p>-- AN EDITORIALIST TACKLED THE ISSUE OF FREEDOM VERSUS </p><p>SECURITY AFTER THE ATTACKS.  ANOTHER QUESTIONED WESTERN </p><p>STANDARDS AND LIKENED THE U.S. CURRENT SITUATION TO </p><p>HITLER\'S GERMANY AND STALIN\'S RUSSIA.  WHILE THE </p><p>GENERAL EDITORIAL TREND IS TO CALL FOR THE EXERCISE OF </p><p>WISDOM AND NOT TO FOLLOW THE PREJUDGMENT AGAINST BIN </p><p>LADEN, ONE COLUMNIST ATTACKED THE TALIBAN FOR </p><p>PROTECTING BIN LADEN. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE MIDDLE EAST SITUATION, WHILE STILL ON ALL FRONT </p><p>PAGES, WAS EMPHASIZED IN PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S INTERVIEWS </p><p>WITH CNN AND BBC.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>2. QUOTE OF THE DAY </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>"THESE HAPHAZARD ACCUSATIONS THAT LACK FIRM EVIDENCE </p><p>MAKE THE TRAGEDY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- WITH WHOM </p><p>EVERYONE SYMPATHIZED -- A FARCE WITH WHICH NO ONE </p><p>SYMPATHIZES.  IS THIS WESTERN DEMOCRACY?.. I REGRET </p><p>WHAT IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA." LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT </p><p>AHRAM\'S REGULAR COLUMNIST HAZEM ABDEL RAHMAN </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>3. BLOCK QUOTES </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>-- "FREEDOM AND SECURITY" LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT AL </p><p>AHRAM\'S SENIOR MODERATE COLUMNIST AHMED BAHGAT (9/19): </p><p>DICTATORSHIPS DEEPLY DIFFER FROM DEMOCRACIES.  UNLIKE </p><p>THE CITIZEN IN THE TOTALITARIAN REGIMES, THE CITIZENS </p><p>IN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES ENJOY FREEDOM OF SPEECH, </p><p>MOVEMENT AND ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE.  THE PERPETRATORS OF </p><p>THE ATTACKS IN WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK EXPLOITED THESE </p><p>PRIVILEGES.. [HOWEVER,] AMERICANS ARE FEELING THAT </p><p>THEIR FREEDOM IS THREATENED BY FIRM SECURITY MEASURES.. </p><p>AMERICAN ANALYSTS BECAME AWARE OF THIS CRISIS AND </p><p>STRESSED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT LOSE THEIR FREEDOM FOR </p><p>SECURITY REQUIREMENTS..  WILL AMERICA SUCCEED IN </p><p>SOLVING THE EQUATION OF BALANCING FREEDOM WITH </p><p>SECURITY?.. THE ADVANTAGE OF DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES IS </p><p>THAT EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL WITHOUT FEELING </p><p>SECURITY.  WILL THIS IMAGE CHANGE?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "READY MADE ACCUSATION" LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT </p><p>AHRAM\'S REGULAR COLUMNIST HAZEM ABDEL RAHMAN (9/19): </p><p>"THE U.S. WILL NOT LOSE ANYTHING BY HITTING BIN LADEN\'S </p><p>BASES IN AFGHANISTAN.  IT DID IT IN 1998 AFTER THE </p><p>EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN NAIROBI AND DAR ESSALAM.  THE </p><p>PROBLEM IS THAT IT MAY FAIL AGAIN IN CAPTURING HIM.. ON </p><p>THE OTHER HAND, WHO SAID THAT HE IS THE SOLE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE PARTY IN THE NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON </p><p>ATTACKS?  HOW CAN THE CIA AND FBI BE TRUSTED SO RAPIDLY </p><p>AFTER PROVING THEIR UTTER FAILURE IN DETECTING THE </p><p>ATTACK AND REVEALING THE PERPETRATORS?..  AMAZINGLY, </p><p>THE U.S., A SOCIETY OF POLITICAL PLURALISM, HAS </p><p>SUDDENLY BECOME SIMILAR TO A NAZI SOCIETY IN HITLER\'S </p><p>TIME, OR A SOVIET SOCIETY IN STALIN\'S RULE: EVERYONE IS </p><p>MOBILIZED BEHIND THE ONE TREND AND ONE OPINION TO </p><p>RETALIATE AGAINST A SPECIFIC PERSON BEFORE THE </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS EVEN START.  CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE NOW </p><p>ACCUSED OF BEING TERRORISTS FOR THE MERE FACT THAT </p><p>THEIR NAMES WERE ON THE TRAVEL LISTS BECAUSE THEY ARE </p><p>ARABS OR MOSLEMS, OR POSSESSED BOOKS ON HOW TO FLY A </p><p>PLANE OR HOW TO BE A MOSLEM.  WHERE IS THE SERIOUSNESS </p><p>OF THE INVESTIGATIONS?  THESE HAPHAZARD ACCUSATIONS </p><p>THAT LACK FIRM EVIDENCE MAKE THE TRAGEDY OF THE </p><p>AMERICAN PEOPLE -- WITH WHOM EVERYONE SYMPATHIZED -- A </p><p>FARCE WITH WHICH NO ONE SYMPATHIZES.  IS THIS WESTERN </p><p>DEMOCRACY?  DOES IT CHANGE, AT THE TIME OF DANGER, TO A </p><p>BRAINWASH OPERATION AND AN OPEN FALSIFICATION OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE MOST MODERN NATION?  WHO </p><p>SAYS THAT ONLY ARAB MOSLEMS COMMIT SUICIDE?  WHERE ARE </p><p>THE KAMIKAZE PILOTS OR THE BUDDHISTS MONKS?..  I REGRET </p><p>WHAT IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA." </p><p> </p><p>-- "HATE CAMPAIGNS" LEADING PRO-GOVERNMENT AL AHRAM\'S </p><p>SENIOR INFLUENTIAL COLUMNIST SALAMA AHMED SALAMA </p><p>(9/19): "THE HATE CAMPAIGNS AND HARASSMENT OF ARABS AND </p><p>MOSLEMS IN AMERICA AND ALL THE WESTERN COUNTRIES IS </p><p>RISING DAY AFTER ANOTHER..  THAT IS WHY PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p>VISITED THE ISLAMIC CENTER IN WASHINGTON..  OUR FEAR IS </p><p>THAT THE STATEMENTS OF OFFICIALS IN AMERICA AND EUROPE </p><p>BECOME USELESS WITH THE WESTERN MEDIA CONTINUAL </p><p>MOBILIZATION OF FEELINGS AGAINST THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC </p><p>TERRORISM AND THOSE SAVAGE ARABS WHO WANT TO CRUSH </p><p>WESTERN CIVILIZATION..  THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS THE </p><p>USE OF ARAB DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS WORLDWIDE?  WHY DO THEY </p><p>NOT ADOPT A COLLECTIVE PROTEST POSITION AGAINST THESE </p><p>ATTACKS?  SILENCE WILL ONLY ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO </p><p>CONTINUE THE MISTREATMENT." </p><p> </p><p>-- "THE ISLAMOPHOBIA AND AMERICAN REVENGE" LEADING PRO- </p><p>GOVERNMENT AL AHRAM\'S COLUMNIST SALAH EDDIN HAFEZ </p><p>(9/19): "WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A TARGET OF ACCUSATIONS </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE TRADITIONS OF SUPERPOWER. IT FIRST </p><p>AVENGES ITS INJURED PRIDE, AND THEN THINKS ABOUT </p><p>INVESTIGATING THE ATTACKS..  THE RAPID EFFORT TO FORM </p><p>AN INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE OR CONFERENCE LED BY THE U.S. </p><p>TO FIGHT TERRORISM IS THANKFUL.. HOWEVER, WHERE WERE </p><p>THESE EFFORTS WHEN TERRORIST GROUPS KILLED AND BURNED </p><p>LAND IN [EGYPT AND ARAB COUNTRIES]?  WHERE WERE THESE </p><p>FEVERISH EFFORTS WHEN ISRAEL KILLS, BURNS AND DESTROYS </p><p>DAILY?..  IT IS GOOD TO SPEAK WITH AMERICA AND EUROPE </p><p>ABOUT PEACE, STABILITY, DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND </p><p>FIGHTING TERRORISM.  HOWEVER, THIS MUST BE BASED ON </p><p>UNIFIED STANDARDS AND BALANCED GUIDELINES.  WE SHOULD </p><p>REMEMBER WHEN THE U.S. RUSHED AND PRESSURED EVERYONE TO </p><p>HOLD AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FIGHTING TERRORISM </p><p>IN SHARM EL SHEIKH, EGYPT, IN 1996, WHEN IT TURNED OUT </p><p>TO BE AN AMERICAN ATTEMPT ONLY TO HELP ISRAEL\'S PERES </p><p>WIN THE ELECTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>-- "IF I WERE IN TALIBAN\'S SHOES" LEADING PRO- </p><p>GOVERNMENT AHRAM\'S COLUMNIST SALAH MONTASSER (9/19): </p><p>"WHEN BIN LADEN WENT TO AFGHANISTAN, HE RAISED THE </p><p>BANNER OF `STRUGGLING AGAINST THE INFIDELS;\' A CALL </p><p>THAT THE U.S. NOURISHED SO THAT IT WOULD BE USED </p><p>AGAINST THE SOVIETS INSTEAD OF DIRECT AMERICAN </p><p>INTERVENTION..  BIN LADEN WAS TEMPTED BY THE WEALTH HE </p><p>INHERITED, THE STRENGTH THAT EMERGED IN TRAINING CAMPS </p><p>AND INFLOW OF WEAPONS TO SERVE HIS OWN PURPOSE OF </p><p>FORMING THE LARGEST TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.FROM WHICH </p><p>EGYPT SUFFERED..  IN SUMMARY, BIN LADEN IS NOT THE </p><p>INNOCENT NATIONALIST WHO DESERVES THE PROTECTION OF ANY </p><p>COUNTRY.  IF I WERE IN TALIBAN\'S SHOES I WOULD QUESTION </p><p>FIRST BIN LADEN\'S SELFISHNESS AND ASK HIM WHETHER HE </p><p>ACCEPTS TO SURRENDER HIMSELF TO PROTECT AFGHANISTAN </p><p>FROM THE IMPENDING DESTRUCTION OR NOT." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WELCH </p><p></p></div>
