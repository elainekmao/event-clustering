<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 BELGRADE 000278 </p><p> </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME FOR MAUREEN GREWE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PBTS, MW, SR, YI </p><p>SUBJECT: "YUGOSLAVIA" OFFICIALLY DISAPPEARS, GIVES WAY </p><p>TO "SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO" </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  ON FEBRUARY 4, FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION OF THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER AND IMPLEMENTATION LAW, THE </p><p>YUGOSLAV PARLIAMENT OFFICIALLY PROCLAIMED THE END OF </p><p>THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA AND THE BEGINNING OF </p><p>THE STATE UNION OF "SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO." THIRTY </p><p>FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS IMMEDIATELY CEASED TO EXIST, SEVEN </p><p>-- INCLUDING THE NATIONAL BANK OF YUGOSLAVIA -- HAVE </p><p>BECOME SERBIAN BODIES, AND 15 SCIENTIFIC, CULTURAL, AND </p><p>TRANSPORTATION BODIES ARE NOW IN LIMBO. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE IMPLEMENTATION LAW SETS A CLEAR TIMETABLE FOR </p><p>THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE JOINT STATE. A NEW UNION </p><p>ASSEMBLY IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN PLACE WITHIN TWO WEEKS, </p><p>AND THE STATE UNION\'S FIRST PRESIDENT AND HIS CABINET </p><p>SHOULD BE APPOINTED BY MARCH 6. IN ADDITION, SERBIA AND </p><p>MONTENEGRO ARE OBLIGED TO AMEND OR REPLACE THEIR </p><p>CURRENT CONSTITUTIONS IN LINE WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>CHARTER BY JUNE 30, ALTHOUGH SERBIAN PRIME MINISTER </p><p>DJINDJIC ALREADY HAS POINTED TO SEPTEMBER AS A MORE </p><p>REALISTIC TIMELINE FOR THE ADOPTION OF A NEW SERBIAN </p><p>CONSTITUTION. THE ALREADY APPARENT DISREGARD OF KEY </p><p>OFFICIALS TOWARD THE PROVISIONS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION </p><p>LAW, AND THE NARROW MAJORITY THAT THE RULING SERBIAN </p><p>AND MONTENEGRIN COALITIONS WILL HAVE IN THE NEW UNION </p><p>ASSEMBLY, SUGGEST THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A </p><p>FUNCTIONING JOINT STATE WILL TAKE LONGER THAN </p><p>ENVISIONED. EU HIGH REPRESENTATIVE SOLANA IS DUE IN </p><p>BELGRADE ON FEBRUARY 6 TO TRY TO SUSTAIN MOMENTUM FOR </p><p>THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE JOINT STATE AND THE DRAFTING </p><p>OF A DETAILED ACTION PLAN FOR ECONOMIC HARMONIZATION, </p><p>DUE NEXT MONTH. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>FEDERAL PARLIAMENT PROCLAIMS CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>3.  ON FEBRUARY 4, BOTH CHAMBERS OF THE YUGOSLAV </p><p>PARLIAMENT VOTED TO ADOPT THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER </p><p>AND ITS ACCOMPANYING IMPLEMENTATION LAW, FOLLOWING </p><p>THEIR ADOPTION LAST WEEK BY THE SERBIAN AND MONTENEGRIN </p><p>PARLIAMENTS. THIS ACT WAS FOLLOWED IN THE EVENING BY A </p><p>PROCLAMATION CEREMONY OFFICIALLY MARKING THE END OF THE </p><p>FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA AND THE BEGINNING OF THE </p><p>STATE UNION OF "SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO." IN THE PROCESS, </p><p>THE FRY TRANSFERRED ALL OF ITS RIGHTS AND DUTIES TO THE </p><p>NEW STATE UNION. </p><p> </p><p>4. SUPPORT FROM SERBIA\'S RULING DOS COALITION AND THE </p><p>MONTENEGRO\'S TWO MAJOR PARTIES -- THE RULING DPS PARTY </p><p>AND THE OPPOSITION SNP PARTY -- GUARANTEED RELATIVELY </p><p>EASY PASSAGE OF THE TWO DOCUMENTS IN BOTH HOUSES OF THE </p><p>FEDERAL PARLIAMENT. AS IN THE SERBIAN PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>VOTE, YUGOSLAV PRESIDENT KOSTUNICA\'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY </p><p>OF SERBIA (DSS) WAS THE MOST NOTABLE DISSENTER, VOTING </p><p>FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER BUT AGAINST THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION LAW. </p><p> </p><p>FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS INSTANTLY TRANSFORMED OR DISSOLVED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>5. BASED ON ARTICLES 14, 15, AND 16 OF THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION LAW, THIRTY FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS -- </p><p>INCLUDING THE MINISTRIES OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS, FINANCE, </p><p>JUSTICE, AND TRANSPORT -- CEASED TO EXIST UPON THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT\'S PROCLAMATION OF THE CHARTER. ALSO </p><p>EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, SEVEN FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS -- </p><p>INCLUDING THE NATIONAL BANK OF YUGOSLAVIA AND THE </p><p>FEDERAL CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION -- HAVE BECOME SERBIAN </p><p>BODIES, ALTHOUGH THE SERBIAN PARLIAMENT STILL IS </p><p>OBLIGED TO PASS NEW REGULATIONS FORMALIZING THEIR PLACE </p><p>IN THE SERBIAN BUREAUCRACY. FIFTEEN SCIENTIFIC, </p><p>CULTURAL, AND TRANSPORTATION BODIES ARE NOW IN LIMBO, </p><p>REMAINING IN OPERATION AT THE JOINT-STATE LEVEL "UNTIL </p><p>THEIR FINAL STATUS IS DEFINED." </p><p> </p><p>OSTENSIBLY FIRM TIMETABLE SET IN MOTION </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  WITH ITS ADOPTION, THE IMPLEMENTATION LAW SETS A </p><p>CLEAR TIMETABLE FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE JOINT </p><p>STATE AND THE COMPOSITION OF ITS EXECUTIVE, </p><p>LEGISLATIVE, AND JUDICIAL STRUCTURES. THE FOLLOWING IS </p><p>A CALENDAR OF DEADLINES SET FORTH BY THE LAW, ALTHOUGH </p><p>PAST EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT NONE OF THESE DEADLINES </p><p>ARE LIKELY TO BE TREATED WITH STRICT OBEDIENCE: </p><p> </p><p>-- FEBRUARY 14: SERBIAN AND MONTENEGRIN PARLIAMENTS </p><p>PASS RESPECTIVE LAWS ON INDIRECT ELECTION OF DEPUTIES </p><p>TO THE NEW UNION ASSEMBLY </p><p> </p><p>-- FEBRUARY 19: INDIRECT ELECTION OF MPS TO THE UNION </p><p>ASSEMBLY </p><p> </p><p>-- WEEK OF 24 FEBRUARY: THE FIRST SESSION OF THE UNION </p><p>ASSEMBLY IS HELD (WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF ELECTION OF MPS). </p><p>THIS SESSION, WHICH IS LIKELY TO LAST SEVERAL DAYS, </p><p>WILL ELECT THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER AND VICE-SPEAKER AND </p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEW STATE UNION. IT WILL ALSO </p><p>ENACT THE LAW ON THE TEMPORARY FINANCING OF THE STATE </p><p>UNION. </p><p> </p><p>-- AROUND END OF FEBRUARY: PRESIDENT PROPOSES </p><p>COMPOSITION OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS (WITHIN 5 DAYS </p><p>OF THE PRESIDENT\'S ELECTION). </p><p> </p><p>-- MARCH 6: "ALL INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE UNION WILL </p><p>BE CONSTITUTED, I.E. WILL BE ELECTED." (THIS APPARENTLY </p><p>IS THE DEADLINE FOR THE ASSEMBLY TO APPROVE THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S PROPOSED CABINET). </p><p> </p><p>-- MID-MARCH: APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES TO THE "COURT OF </p><p>SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO (WITHIN 25 DAYS OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S ELECTION) </p><p> </p><p>-- MID-MARCH: ADOPTION OF OMNIBUS LAW REGULATING THE </p><p>"ORGANIZATION, MODE OF WORK, AND SUPERVISIONS" OF THE </p><p>JOINT STATE\'S INSTITUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- MARCH 31: COMPLETION OF DETAILED ACTION PLAN FOR THE </p><p>INTERNAL MARKET AND FOREIGN TRADE </p><p> </p><p>-- APRIL 5: FORMATION OF COMMISSION ON THE DIVISION OF </p><p>FRY PROPERTY AND ASSETS </p><p> </p><p>-- JUNE 30: REPUBLICS EITHER AMEND OR REPLACE CURRENT </p><p>CONSTITUTIONS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>CHARTER. </p><p> </p><p>-- JULY 4: PROPERTY AND ASSET COMMISSION MUST FORWARD A </p><p>DRAFT LAW TO THE SERBIAN AND MONTENEGRIN PARLIAMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- DECEMBER 31: REPUBLICS MUST HARMONIZE ALL OF THEIR </p><p>LAWS AND OTHER REGULATIONS WITH THE CHARTER AND THE </p><p>LAWS OF THE NEW UNION </p><p> </p><p>7.  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 22 OF THE IMPLEMENTATION LAW, </p><p>"ALL THE DEADLINES DEFINED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>CHARTER WILL COME INTO EFFECT FROM THE DAY THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER COMES INTO EFFECT." HENCE, </p><p>DIRECT ELECTIONS FOR THE UNION ASSEMBLY\'S DEPUTIES MUST </p><p>TAKE PLACE IN FEBRUARY 2005. LIKEWISE, NEITHER REPUBLIC </p><p>CAN SCHEDULE A REFERENDUM ON SECEDING FROM THE JOINT </p><p>STATE UNTIL FEBRUARY 2006, ALTHOUGH MONTENEGRO\'S PRO- </p><p>INDEPENDENCE PARTIES STILL MAY TRY TO POINT TO MARCH </p><p>14, 2005, THREE YEARS AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE BELGRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT, AS THE EARLIEST DATE WHEN THEY CAN SLATE </p><p>SUCH A REFERENDUM. </p><p> </p><p>COMPOSITION OF THE NEW UNION ASSEMBLY </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>8. THE NEW ASSEMBLY WILL COMPRISE 126 DEPUTIES, 91 FROM </p><p>SERBIA, 35 FROM MONTENEGRO. ACCORDING TO MIODRAG ISAKOV </p><p>OF SERBIA\'S RULING DOS COALITION, DOS WILL HAVE 47 </p><p>SEATS, DSS 16, THE SOCIALIST PARTY OF SERBIA (SPS) 12, </p><p>THE SERBIAN RADICAL PARTY 8, THE PARTY OF SERBIAN UNITY </p><p>4, NEW SERBIA 2, AND THE SPS SPLINTER SOCIALIST </p><p>PEOPLE\'S PARTY (SNP) 2. OF THE 35 MONTENEGRIN SEATS, </p><p>SOURCES SAY THAT 21 WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE </p><p>RULING COALITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF SOCIALISTS, </p><p>SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP), AND ETHNIC ALBANIAN </p><p>PARTY AND THE REMAINING 14 WILL GO TO THE OPPOSITION </p><p>TOGETHER FOR CHANGES BLOC. </p><p> </p><p>9. THE TWO RULING COALITIONS THEREFORE HOLD A FEW SEATS </p><p>MORE THAN THE 64 SEATS NECESSARY FOR A MAJORITY VOTE IN </p><p>THE NEW UNION ASSEMBLY. IF THE TREND OF COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN THE RULING SERBIAN AND MONTENEGRIN COALITIONS </p><p>ESTABLISHED DURING THE DRAFTING OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>CHARTER CONTINUES, OFFICIALS OF THE NEW UNION SHOULD BE </p><p>ABLE TO STICK CLOSELY TO THE TIMETABLE SET FORTH ABOVE. </p><p>NONETHELESS, THE 16 REMAINING PARTIES IN THE DOS </p><p>COALITION MAINTAIN VARYING DEGREES OF LOYALTY TO </p><p>SERBIAN PRIME MINISTER DJINDJIC, AND MONTENEGRIN PRIME </p><p>MINISTER DJUKANOVIC\'S COALITION PARTNERS HAVE ALREADY </p><p>SHOWED THEIR INDEPENDENCE BY VOTING AGAINST ADOPTION OF </p><p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER. </p><p> </p><p>SOLANA SEEKS TO SUSTAIN MOMENTUM </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>10. EU DELEGATION OFFICIALS CONFIRMED TO POST THAT EU </p><p>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE JAVIER SOLANA PLANS TO VISIT </p><p>BELGRADE AND PODGORICA ON FEBRUARY 6 TO CONGRATULATE </p><p>OFFICIALS IN BOTH CAPITALS ON THE OFFICIAL ADOPTION OF </p><p>THE CHARTER AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE UNION OF </p><p>SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO. HIS PRIMARY MESSAGE WILL BE THAT </p><p>THE REAL WORK OF ESTABLISHING A FUNCTIONING JOINT STATE </p><p>AND IMPLEMENTING AN ACTION PLAN FOR AN INTERNAL MARKET </p><p>AND FOREIGN TRADE HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>11. ALTHOUGH AN IMPORTANT EVENT, THE END OF </p><p>"YUGOSLAVIA" AND THE BEGINNING OF "SERBIA AND </p><p>MONTENEGRO" WAS GREETED WITH LITTLE JOY IN EITHER </p><p>SERBIA OR MONTENEGRO.  THE LONG DELAY IN CRAFTING THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER AND THE FRAGILITY OF THE NEW </p><p>UNION HAVE LEFT THE PUBLIC WITH AN APPREHENSIVE </p><p>FEELING.  IT IS INAUSPICIOUS (ALBEIT NOT SURPRISING) </p><p>THAT KEY OFFICIALS ALREADY BEGAN IGNORING PROVISIONS OF </p><p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER EVEN BEFORE ITS OFFICIAL </p><p>PROCLAMATION. FOR INSTANCE, SERBIAN PM DJINDJIC </p><p>INDICATED PUBLICLY THAT HE AND MONTENEGRIN PM </p><p>DJUKANOVIC HAVE AGREED THAT TWO SERBS WILL HOLD THE </p><p>FOREIGN AND DEFENSE MINISTER POSTS IN THE NEW UNION, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH ARTICLE 14 OF THE CHARTER SPECIFICALLY </p><p>STIPULATES THAT THESE TWO MINISTERS SHALL BE FROM </p><p>DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES.  SIMILARLY, ON FEBRUARY 1, </p><p>DJINDJIC SAID THAT SERBIA\'S NEW CONSTITUTION COULD BE </p><p>COMPLETED BY SEPTEMBER, EVEN THOUGH THE PARLIAMENT IS </p><p>OBLIGED BY THE CHARTER TO ADOPT THE NEW CONSTITUTION BY </p><p>JUNE 30. </p><p> </p><p>12. ON THIS BASIS ALONE, WE CAN BE EXPECT THAT SERBIA </p><p>AND MONTENEGRO WILL NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE FIRM </p><p>TIMETABLE FOR ESTABLISHING A FUNCTIONING JOINT STATE </p><p>SET FORTH IN THE IMPLEMENTATION LAW. THE MOST </p><p>COMPELLING INCENTIVES FOR THE TWO MEMBER STATES TO DO </p><p>SO, HOWEVER, WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROVIDED BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. IN THE NEAR-TERM, THE NEW </p><p>ASSEMBLY\'S ENACTMENT OF A LAW ON THE TEMPORARY </p><p>FINANCING OF THE STATE UNION IS A PREREQUISITE FOR THE </p><p>IMF BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO HOLD AN ALREADY TWICE-DELAYED </p><p>MEETING TO REVIEW COMPLIANCE WITH THE FUND\'S THREE-YEAR </p><p>EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT (EA) WITH SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO </p><p>AND TO APPROVE THE THIRD TRANCHE OF THE EA. IN </p><p>ADDITION, SOLANA IS LIKELY TO REMIND OFFICIALS THAT THE </p><p>LAUNCHING OF THE EU\'S STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION </p><p>PROCESS, STARTING WITH A FEASIBILITY STUDY, IS </p><p>CONDITIONED ON THE DRAFTING OF A DETAILED ACTION PLAN </p><p>OF ECONOMIC HARMONIZATION BY THE END OF MARCH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MONTGOMERY </p><p></p></div>
