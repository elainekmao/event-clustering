<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001805 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, CASC, CVIS, EAIR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: JORDANIANS\' RAGE AT US FOR IRAQ WAR DRIVEN </p><p>BY ARAB TELEVISION\'S WAR COVERAGE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Classified by: Acting DCM Doug Silliman. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: A survey of Embassy contacts shows an </p><p>increasing use of words like outrage, hostility, rage, </p><p>dismay, disillusion and impotence to describe the war in </p><p>Iraq.  Most Jordanians, across all age groups and social </p><p>classes, believe the Bush administration failed to provide </p><p>legitimate justification or international approval for the </p><p>war, and feel that it is protecting Israeli and U.S. </p><p>interests: controlling oil supplies, getting rid of Saddam, </p><p>and redrawing the map of the region.  They closely identify </p><p>with their long suffering Iraqi brothers and sisters who must </p><p>pay the price for "the US aggression."  Some Jordanians take </p><p>comfort in the anti-war demonstrations occurring throughout </p><p>the country, but are disillusioned with the government\'s </p><p>tight security controls and its perceived capitulation to </p><p>Washington\'s demands. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Jordanians glued to Arab television\'s War coverage </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Anywhere one goes in Jordan these days--a fruit stand, </p><p>small grocery store or a person\'s home--one finds everyone </p><p>glued to Iraq war coverage on Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya or </p><p>Lebanese television.  As soon as any news breaks, people rush </p><p>to their cell phones to either call or text message friends </p><p>and family members with their views and commentary.  Many </p><p>express solidarity with Iraqis resisting "the US aggression" </p><p>and wonder if the US soldiers know why they are fighting in </p><p>Iraq.  A middle class shopowner says he witnessed people </p><p>cheering when an American soldier is either caught or killed. </p><p> Older, war weary Jordanians express dismay at seeing both </p><p>Iraqi and American dead on their tv screens, and feel the </p><p>Bush Administration should have given diplomacy more time.  A </p><p>woman in her 50s says: Americans do not understand the Arab </p><p>mindset--"my brother and me against my cousin, and my </p><p>brother, my cousin and me against the enemy--Arabs must unite </p><p>against the U.S." </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Shock and Awe </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) This military campaign causes very negative "shock and </p><p>awe" to Jordanians when they view the military and </p><p>technological power being dropped on what they perceive to be </p><p>a defenseless population.  Although many, especially </p><p>university educated Jordanians, view Saddam as a tyrant and </p><p>oppressor of his people, many use the exact words to describe </p><p>President Bush.  Upper class Jordanians and Jordanians of </p><p>Palestinian origin laugh at arguments that the war\'s aim is </p><p>to free the Iraqi people of a repressive regime: they view </p><p>this war as an occupation of Iraq.  They question why the US </p><p>aided Saddam in the past when he has always been known to be </p><p>a ruthless dictator and butcher by the Iraqi people.  Many </p><p>argue this is only the beginning of a series of U.S. military </p><p>adventures: Afghanistan first, now Iraq.  Many Jordanians are </p><p>asking "who will be next?" </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Pol Fsn emphasized that this war has polarized people </p><p>against the US.  Many of what she described as moderate </p><p>friends in their late 20s who studied in the US and had very </p><p>favorable views of the US have now moved into the anti-US </p><p>camp. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Disillusioned with their government </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) A group of Jordanian men in their 30s from a large </p><p>Jordanian tribe expressed disillusionment with their own </p><p>government.  They don\'t trust what the government is saying, </p><p>don\'t believe its public statements, and see the King as </p><p>having capitulated to the US government.  As evidence they </p><p>cite the presence of the US military in Jordan, the King\'s </p><p>speech asking people to stay calm and calling the war </p><p>"regrettable", the announcement of the rescheduling of </p><p>Jordan\'s debt to the U.S., and the last straw, the expulsion </p><p>of several Iraqi diplomats.  Many Jordanians feel Jordan\'s </p><p>cooperation has been "bought" by the US and feel ashamed and </p><p>impotent to influence their government. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Public Demonstrations </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Hundreds of students have been demonstrating almost </p><p>daily at universities throughout Jordan.  Jordan University </p><p>was the site of a large anti-war protest on March 23, where </p><p>hundreds of students had to be contained by riot police using </p><p>water cannons and tear gas when they attempted to leave the </p><p>campus.  Several more "licensed" protests have been announced </p><p>as the government tries to allow a civilized means for people </p><p>to express their deep frustrations with the war.  The </p><p>government emphasizes that "licensed" public demonstrations </p><p>will be permitted but "unlicensed" demonstrations or acts of </p><p>violence will not be tolerated. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C)  This is the first time that Jordanians, and the Arab </p><p>world for that matter, are seeing the war played live and </p><p>uncensored on their t.v. screens.  Iraqi propaganda--images </p><p>of dead Iraqi children, appearances by Senior Iraqi leaders </p><p>who had been declared dead by the Western media, and scenes </p><p>of "heroic" resistance by irregular Iraqi forces--is not </p><p>being countered by pro-coalition images.   This new </p><p>phenomenon presents a difficult situation for the GOJ as </p><p>Jordanians form their opinion and decide to act to a large </p><p>extent based on what they are witnessing as each day of the </p><p>war progresses. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
