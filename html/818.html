THE GENERAL WARNED THAT ETHIOPIAN </p><p>MILITARY AUTHORITIES ARE WRONG TO ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE </p><p>THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL.  HE SUGGESTED THAT ONLY A </p><p>REGIONAL EFFORT, COORDINATED BEHIND THE SCENES BY THE </p><p>UNITED STATES, CAN DEFEAT THE WELL-FINANCED, HIGHLY </p><p>DISCIPLINED GUERRILLAS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ON 29 FEBRUARY POLOFF AND DEFENSE ATTACHE MET </p><p>WITH RETIRED SOMALI GENERAL JAMA "GREEN".  THE MEETING </p><p>WAS ARRANGED BY FREQUENT EMBASSY CONTACTS DR. FARAH </p><p>HUSSEIN MOHAMED AND MOHAMMED MURSAL SHIL.  SOMALILAND </p><p>SUPREME COURT JUSTICE MUSSA (FNU) WAS PRESENT FOR THE </p><p>FIRST FEW MINUTES, BUT THEN SLIPPED OUT OF THE MEETING </p><p>SAYING HE WOULD "TALK WITH POLOFF LATER." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>JAMA WELL-ACQUAINTED WITH AL\'ITTIHAD </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  GENERAL JAMA COMMANDED SOMALI FORCES WHICH HE </p><p>CLAIMED HAD DEFEATED THE AL\'ITTIHAD ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS IN JANUARY 1993.  THE GENERAL SAID THAT </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD AT THAT TIME WAS 10,000 STRONG AND BASED </p><p>PRIMARILY IN "SOMALILAND."  THE GENERAL SAID THAT HIS </p><p>FORCES CUT OFF MORE THAN 3,000 GUERRILLAS FROM THEIR </p><p>SOURCES OF SUPPLY IN A POCKET NEAR THE TOWN OF ERIGAVO </p><p>//GEOCOORDS:  1037N/4722E//.  JAMA SAID HIS UNITS KILLED </p><p>MANY OF THE AL\'ITTIHAD FIGHTERS BEFORE THE REMAINDER </p><p>SURRENDERED.  JAMA SAID HIS TROOPS ROUNDED THEM UP, </p><p>TRUCKED THEM INTO THE WESTERN DESERT, AND TOLD THEM TO GO </p><p>BACK TO THEIR CLANS.  THE GENERAL ESTIMATED THAT SOME </p><p>2,000 AL\'ITTIHAD MEMBERS FLED INTO ETHIOPIA, WITH MANY </p><p>SETTLING IN WARDER //GEOCOORDS: 0658N/4520E//, GODE </p><p>//GEOCOORDS: 0606N/4301E//, AND KEBRI DEHAR //GEOCOORDS: </p><p>0644N/4417E//. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD IS RISING FROM THE ASHES </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  GENERAL JAMA SAID AL\'ITTIHAD IS NOW REGROUPING </p><p>IN THE SOMALI REGIONAL STATE AND THAT THE EXTREMISTS ARE </p><p>BEING TRAINED IN THE REGION BY INSTRUCTORS FROM YEMEN, </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, AND IRAQ (NFI).  OTHER AL\'ITTIHAD MEMBERS </p><p>ARE RECEIVING TRAINING IN LIBYA, SUDAN, IRAN.  A FEW ARE </p><p>IN MOMBASA, KENYA.  THE GENERAL SAID HE HAS HEARD, BUT </p><p>CANNOT CONFIRM, THAT SOME ARE IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD THREATENS THE HORN </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE GENERAL DESCRIBED AL\'ITTIHAD AS THE MOST </p><p>DANGEROUS THREAT TO STABILITY IN THE HORN OF AFRICA.  HE </p><p>DESCRIBED AL\'ITTIHAD AS HAVING ITS ROOTS OUTSIDE SOMALIA </p><p>AND SAID THAT THE CHAOS FOLLOWING THE FALL OF SIAD BARRE </p><p>GAVE THE POLITICAL ISLAMISTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>PENETRATE THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  JAMA SAID THE FUNDAMENTALIST GOAL IS TO </p><p>ESTABLISH AN ISLAMIC STATE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT AL\'ITTIHAD IS COMPRISED OF DISCIPLINED </p><p>FANATICS WHO HATE INTELLECTUALS, CHRISTIANITY, WHITE </p><p>PEOPLE, AND LOCAL RELIGIOUS LEADERS.  HE SAID THEY </p><p>EXPLOIT THE IGNORANCE OF THE PEOPLE ABOUT RELIGION TO </p><p>SPREAD THEIR FALSE MILITANT VERSION OF THE KORAN. </p><p>(SOURCE COMMENT:  HENCE THEIR HATRED OF RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>EXTERNAL SUPPORT TO THE EXTREMISTS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  JAMA DESCRIBED SUDANESE LEADER AL TURABI AS THE </p><p>SPIRITUAL LEADER OF THE EFFORT TO CREATE AN ISLAMIC </p><p>STATE, AND SAID AL\'ITTIHAD RECEIVES ASSISTANCE FROM </p><p>SUDAN, IRAN, IRAQ, AND LIBYA.  HE SAID THEIR CURRENT </p><p>METHOD OF OPERATION IS TO FUNNEL AID THROUGH SOMALI </p><p>STRONGMAN MOHAMMED FARAH AIDEED, WHOM JAMA DESCRIBED AS </p><p>"A POWER-HUNGRY ANIMAL WHO CARES LITTLE ABOUT THE PEOPLE </p><p>OF SOMALIA."  JAMA ADDED THAT THE EMIR OF SHARIQAH (AS </p><p>HEARD) IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES ALSO SUPPORTS </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD. </p><p>                                                     - </p><p>9.  (C)  JAMA SAID AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO </p><p>TRACE THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD.  THE GENERAL SAID LITTLE MONEY IS SENT </p><p>DIRECTLY TO SOMALIA; MOST IS ROUTED THROUGH EUROPEAN </p><p>SOURCES (NFI), ADDING THAT "A LOT OF WESTERN MONEY IS </p><p>GOING TO AIDEED."  JAMA SAID THE INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC </p><p>RELIEF ORGANIZATION (IRO) IS PARTICULARLY SUSPECT, AND HE </p><p>CLAIMED THAT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE FLOWING, YET THE </p><p>"IRO REJECTED A LEGITIMATE PROPOSAL FOR A LIVESTOCK </p><p>PROJECT." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  POLOFF ASKED THE GENERAL ABOUT THE CARGO </p><p>CARRIED BY SUPPLY FLIGHTS TO AL\'ITTIHAD REPORTED BY DR. </p><p>FARAH.  JAMA CONFIRMED THAT TWO WEEKLY FLIGHTS DEPART </p><p>MOGADISHU FOR A DESERT AIRSTRIP ALONG THE ETHIOPIAN- </p><p>SOMALILAND BORDER (REFTEL).  THE GENERAL SAID RECENT </p><p>CARGOS INCLUDED NEW CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS AND SMALL ARMS </p><p>AMMUNITION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT UNDERESTIMATES THE THREAT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  THE DEFENSE ATTACHE ASKED JAMA WHY THE </p><p>ETHIOPIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE HAS CLAIMED THAT IT </p><p>CONTROLS THE REGION.  JAMA REPLIED THAT THE ETHIOPIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY ARE POORLY INFORMED ABOUT THE </p><p>TRUE SITUATION IN THE SOMALI REGIONAL STATE.  HE SAID THE </p><p>LARGELY TIGRAYAN MILITARY, IN PARTICULAR, HAS SURROUNDED </p><p>ITSELF WITH TRUSTED ETHNIC SOMALI ADVISORS WHO ARE NOT IN </p><p>TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE REGION.  AS A RESULT, JAMA </p><p>SAID THE MILITARY IN THE REGION OFTEN ARREST ALLEGED </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD MEMBERS AND SEIZE THEIR PROPERTY ON THE </p><p>FLIMSIEST OF EVIDENCE.  JAMA SAID THAT WHILE THE PEOPLE </p><p>DO NOT LIKE AL\'ITTIHAD, HEAVY-HANDED EFFORTS BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT ARE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>JAMA EXPLAINS HOW TO DEFEAT AL\'ITTIHAD </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  GENERAL JAMA SAID AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO </p><p>DEFEAT AL\'ITTIHAD IS ESSENTIAL, AND HE ADDED THAT ONLY </p><p>THE UNITED STATES CAN COORDINATE THE ENDEAVOR.  THE MOST </p><p>CRITICAL STEP, HE ARGUED, IS TO CLOSELY WATCH EXTREMIST </p><p>SUPPLY ROUTES THROUGH BERBERA AND DJIBOUTI.  JAMA ALSO </p><p>SUGGESTED MONITORING ARABIC LANGUAGE RADIO TRAFFIC, </p><p>COMMENTING THAT "THE BIG SHOTS LIKE TO TALK AT NIGHT." </p><p>HE SUGGESTED WATCHING HOTELS IN DJIBOUTI, SAYING THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS TEND TO CONGREGATE THERE.  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD MEMBERS OFTEN CHEW CHAT AND TEND TO TALK </p><p>OPENLY OF THEIR ACTIVITIES WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE. </p><p>FINALLY, JAMA SAID THE ETHIOPIA GOVERNMENT MUST OFFER </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO COUNTERBALANCE THE MESSAGE </p><p>OF THE EXTREMISTS, AND THE LARGELY TIGRAYAN LEADERS IN </p><p>ADDIS ABABA MUST EDUCATE THEMSELVES ABOUT THE SOMALI </p><p>NATIONAL STATE. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>BIO DATA </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  RETIRED GENERAL JAMA, 51, IS AN ETHNIC SOMALI </p><p>FROM THE DAROOD CLAN.  JAMA SAID HE SERVED AS A </p><p>BATTALION, BRIGADE, AND DIVISION COMMANDER DURING HIS 29- </p><p>YEAR CAREER IN THE SOMALI ARMY.  THE GENERAL PROMISED TO </p><p>PROVIDE HIS CURRICULUM VITAE TO POLOFF SOON (SEPTEL). </p><p>POL/ECON OAU OFFICER MET GENERAL JAMA DURING GENERAL </p><p>SCHWARZKOPF\'S VISIT TO MOGADISHU IN 1989.  HE REMEMBERS </p><p>HIM AS HAVING A RELATIVELY GOOD PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION, </p><p>BUT BEING OVERSHADOWED BY MORE FLAMBOYANT AND RUTHLESS </p><p>COLLEAGUES SUCH AS "MORGAN." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  OUR SOMALI CONTACTS WERE QUITE NERVOUS AND </p><p>AFRAID THAT AL\'ITTIHAD AGENTS MIGHT BE FOLLOWING THE </p><p>GENERAL.  THE MEETING WAS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED AS A LUNCH </p><p>HOSTED BY THE DATT BUT, ALTHOUGH THE RESTAURANT WAS </p><p>EMPTY, THE SOMALIS REFUSED TO DISCUSS BUSINESS THERE AND </p><p>INSISTED THAT WE ADJOURN TO A PRIVATE HOME.  THEY ALSO </p><p>INSISTED THAT THE AMERICANS DEPART FIRST TO THE FOLLOW-ON </p><p>MEETING.  WE LEFT THE RESTAURANT AND RECONVENED LATER IN </p><p>DR. FARAH\'S HOME.  ONCE THERE, THEY SAID THEY HAD TO BE </p><p>VERY CAREFUL "BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS WATCHING." </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  CLEARLY NONE OF THE SOMALIS FEARED BEING SEEN </p><p>BY ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES.  ALL OF THEM SAID THAT THE </p><p>FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA OFFERS THE BEST </p><p>HOPE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOMALI REGION.  THEY </p><p>COMMENTED THAT THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DARED TO MEET OPENLY </p><p>WITH AMERICANS DURING THE DERG OR EVEN UNDER EMPEROR </p><p>HAILE SELASSIE\'S REGIME. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  POLOFF AND DATT DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE GENERAL </p><p>TO THINK THE U.S. WOULD COORDINATE THE EFFORT TO DEFEAT </p><p>AL\'ITTIHAD.  WE TOLD HIM ONLY THAT WE WOULD REPORT HIS </p><p>REQUEST TO WASHINGTON.  THE GENERAL SEEMED SATISFIED AND </p><p>DID NOT PRESS THE ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>17. (U)  ASMARA MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HICKS </p><p></p></div>
