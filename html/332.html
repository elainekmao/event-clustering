<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HAVANA 00257 </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR ARA/CCA </p><p> </p><p>USIA FOR AR, P/G, VOA/MR, R/SE FOR GRANT, R/AR FOR LLACH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CU </p><p>SUBJECT:  CASTRO\'S CREED "SOCIALISM OR DEATH" </p><p> </p><p>REF:  EVANS/GRANT TELCON 1/2/90 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  WITH THE FALL OF EACH EASTERN EUROPEAN COMMUNIST </p><p>LEADER CASTRO\'S DEFENSE OF SOCIALISM HAS SEEMED TO BECOME </p><p>MORE RIGID.  SHORTLY BEFORE EACH COMMUNIST HEAD LEFT </p><p>OFFICE, CASTRO MADE AN OFFICIAL GESTURE INDICATING </p><p>SOME MEASURE OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS REGIME.  IN ROMANIA\'S </p><p>CASE, THE GOC SIGNED A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CEAUSESCU\'S </p><p>REPS JUST WEEKS BEFORE HIS DEMISE.  AS THESE COMMUNIST </p><p>GOVERNMENTS GO, CASTRO\'S CREED "SOCIALISM OR DEATH" </p><p>TAKES ON A MORE OMINOUS MEANING ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING </p><p>THE BLOODLETTING IN ROMANIA. </p><p> </p><p>CUBAN OFFICIALS EXPLAIN THAT FOR CUBA, IF FOR NO </p><p>OTHER NATION, SOCIALISM IS INEXTRICABLY LINKED WITH </p><p>INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY, NATIONAL IDENTITY AND </p><p>NATIONAL CULTURE.  WITHOUT SOCIALISM CUBA, IN OTHER </p><p>WORDS, WOULD BE EITHER OVERTAKEN OR ABSORBED BY THE </p><p>GIANT BOURGEOIS CAPITALIST STATE TO THE NORTH.  THE </p><p>REAL PURPOSE OF THE SLOGAN, OF COURSE, IS TO MAKE AN </p><p>ENEMY OF ANYONE WHO DOES NOT AGREE WITH CASTRO, TO </p><p>PAINT ANY OPPOSITION TO SOCIALISM AS TREASON, AND TO </p><p>BUILD POPULAR SUPPORT FOR INTOLERANCE AND SUPPRESSION </p><p>OF DISSENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  WE HOPE THE DEPARTMENT, USIA AND OTHER USG AGENCIES </p><p>WILL FIND WAYS TO FOCUS WORLD ATTENTION ON THIS RATHER </p><p>BIZARRE SLOGAN.  "PATRIA O MUERTE," WHICH CASTRO </p><p>ALSO STILL EMPLOYS, RAISES THE IMAGE OF DEFENDING ONES </p><p>COUNTRY AGAINST ALIEN INVADERS.  "LIBERTY OR DEATH" </p><p>SUGGESTS A CHOICE BETWEEN TYRANNY AND </p><p>FREEDOM.  BUT "SOCIALISMO O MUERTE" SIMPLY SUGGESTS </p><p>A STARK CHOICE BETWEEN ACCEPTING A MARXIST SOCIETY </p><p>OR ELSE DYING.  THIS INTERPRETATION IS REINFORCED </p><p>BY THE CONTEXT AND INDEED THE TARGET OF CASTRO\'S </p><p>SLOGAN, I.E., DECISIONS BY INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES AND </p><p>PEOPLES TO INSTITUTE SWEEPING DEMOCRATIC REFORMS </p><p>THAT HAVE DRASTICALLY ALTERED OR COMPLETELY DISCARDED </p><p>MARXIST-LENINIST SYSTEMS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WE WOULD HOPE THAT INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS,AND PRIVATE </p><p>AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS WOULD BEGIN TO </p><p>QUESTION THE MANICHEAN CRY OF THE CUBAN LEADER. </p><p>FOLLOWING ARE SOME SAMPLE QUESTIONS THAT COULD BE POSED: </p><p> </p><p>-- DOES "SOCIALISMO O MUERTE" MEAN THE CUBAN PEOPLE </p><p>HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT SOCIALISM NOW AND FOR </p><p>ALL TIME? </p><p> </p><p>-- DOES ANY CUBAN HAVE THE RIGHT PEACEFULLY TO ESPOUSE </p><p>ANOTHER POLITICAL-ECONOMIC SYSTEM; CAN HE MAKE SPEECHES, </p><p>PRINT ARTICLES, HAVE MEETINGS, ETC. TO PROMOTE </p><p>AN ALTERNATIVE TO SOCIALISM? </p><p> </p><p>-- CAN A CUBAN WHO IS OPPOSED TO SOCIALISM AND IN FAVOR </p><p>OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY BE A LOYAL CITIZEN? </p><p> </p><p>-- WHAT CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS DOES SUCH A PERSON </p><p>HAVE? </p><p> </p><p>-- IF A SOCIALIST REGIME SUCH AS THAT OF CEAUSESCU </p><p>SEES ITSELF ON THE VERGE OF BEING OVERTHROWN, DOES </p><p>IT HAVE THE RIGHT AND THE DUTY TO USE FORCE AGAINST </p><p>CIVILIAN, UNARMED DEMONSTRATORS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN </p><p>SOCIALISM? </p><p> </p><p>-- DO YOU BELIEVE THAT SOCIALISM REPRESENTS A </p><p>LINEAL PROGRESSION OF HISTORY AND THAT ONCE A COUNTRY </p><p>IS SOCIALIST IT MUST ALWAYS REMAIN SOCIALIST? </p><p> </p><p>-- DO YOU STILL SUPPORT THE WARSAW PACT INVASION </p><p>OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA IN 1968 AS HISTORICALLY CORRECT? </p><p> </p><p>-- WAS THE 1968 INVASION AN IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>"SOCIALISMO O MUERTE"? </p><p> </p><p>-- IS THERE ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BREZHNEV </p><p>DOCTRINE AND "SOCIALISMO O MUERTE"? </p><p> </p><p>-- WOULD YOU PREFER TO SEE CUBA SINK UNDER THE OCEAN </p><p>THAN TO SEE IT BECOME NON-SOCIALIST UNDER A </p><p>POPULAR MOVEMENT? </p><p> </p><p>-- YOU SAY SOCIALISM IS SYNONYMOUS WITH NATIONALISM </p><p>IN NBA.  DOES THIS MEAN THAT MEXICO, PERU AND OTHER </p><p>NON-SOCIALIST LATIN COUNTRIES ARE NOT EQUALLY NATIONALIST </p><p>AS CUBA? </p><p> </p><p>-- WHO HAS DECIDED SOCIALISM IS SYNONYMOUS </p><p>WITH NATIONALISM IN CUBA?  CAN ANY CUBAN OPENLY DISPUTE </p><p>THAT? </p><p> </p><p>-- IF THE UNITED STATES BECAME SOCIALIST (COMMUNIST), </p><p>WOULD IT THEN BE POSSIBLE FOR CUBA TO BECOME NON- </p><p>SOCIALIST?  WOULD THE SLOGAN "SOCIALISMO O MUERTE" </p><p>STILL BE VALID? </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  THESE QUESTIONS COULD BE POSED IN AN OPEN LETTER </p><p>TO CASTRO SUCH AS THE RECENT ONE ON A PLEBISCITE </p><p>SIGNED BY 400 INTELLECTUALS.  OTHER VEHICLES COULD </p><p>INCLUDE:  DISCUSSION PANELS ON RADIO MARTI; STATEMENTS </p><p>BY HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS, AND ARTICLES BY PROMINENT </p><p>INDIVIDUALS AND JOURNALISTS.  WE WOULD ALSO EXPECT </p><p>THAT "SOCIALISMO B MUERTE" WOULD MAKE AN INTERESTING </p><p>TOPIC FOR DISCUSSIONS IN GENEVA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TAYLOR </p><p></p></div>
