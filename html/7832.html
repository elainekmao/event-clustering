Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  A new sugar law implemented in September </p><p>2002 was supposed to eliminate the sugar industry\'s  rampant </p><p>overproduction, as well as GOT subsidies for its export, and </p><p>eventually move the industry toward the free market. </p><p>However, even as state-owned sugar company SEKER (its </p><p>privatization process is scheduled to begin in June) is being </p><p>reigned in, its lobbying efforts caused the GOT to include in </p><p>the sugar law quotas that hurt SEKER\'s competitors in the </p><p>cornstarch-based sweetener industry.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Quotas Aimed at Ending Overproduction </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Prior to the onset of the Sugar Law, SEKER </p><p>factories gave guaranteed procurement prices to Turkish sugar </p><p>beet farmers, causing rampant overproduction (these </p><p>guaranteed prices stemmed from a 1945 law).  To reduce its </p><p>stocks, SEKER needed significant GOT subsidies to export its </p><p>overproduction at competitive world prices.  (Beet sugar </p><p>prices are higher, on average, than sugar cane because the </p><p>costs of production are much higher.  When combined with </p><p>refining inefficiency, SEKER must sell its sugar at the rate </p><p>of $550/ton.  The world average is $260/ton.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The new Sugar Law, enacted in April 2001 and taking </p><p>effect in September 2002, was intended to meet market </p><p>liberalization criteria under the IMF Letter of Intent and </p><p>the EU Accession Partnership Accord.  The law ends guaranteed </p><p>procurement prices to farmers as well as GOT export subsidies </p><p>to SEKER and PANKOBIRLIK (Central Union of Sugar Beet </p><p>Producers Cooperatives).  The law establishes production </p><p>quotas for the sugar industry, synchronizing sugar production </p><p>with domestic demand each year until 2007 (at which time the </p><p>industry is supposed to be totally deregulated, in accordance </p><p>with Turkey\'s WTO obligations).  The quotas are assigned by </p><p>the Sugar Board, an independent regulatory body created under </p><p>the Sugar Law that consists of seven members -- three from </p><p>the GOT, three from the sugar-beet industry, and one from the </p><p>cornstarch-based industry (Cargill). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) This year (September 2002-August 2003), SEKER is </p><p>allowed to produce 1.67 million tons of sugar, PANKOBIRLIK </p><p>474,000 tons.  Next year\'s (September 2003-August 2004) </p><p>production quota for SEKER was supposed to be the same as </p><p>this year, but has been reduced to 1.3 million tons due to </p><p>320,000 tons of remaining excess refined sugar (in addition </p><p>to 220,000 tons of excess raw sugar).  Due to the high costs </p><p>of maintaining these stocks, our contacts say that, though </p><p>export subsidies have officially been eliminated, SEKER has </p><p>gotten special permission to export with the subsidy until </p><p>August 2003.  There is a substantial political push to </p><p>increase these quotas.  Since the Sugar Board was created </p><p>prior to AKP\'s electoral victory in November, rumors are </p><p>swirling that the new government is trying to abolish the </p><p>board.  These rumors have been confirmed by our contacts on </p><p>the Sugar Board. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Quotas for One, Quotas for All </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Even as sugar production quotas are theoretically </p><p>being brought down, subquotas mandated by the sugar law are </p><p>limiting production from the entire cornstarch-based </p><p>sweetener industry in Turkey to 10 percent of the total sugar </p><p>quota, or 234,000 tons (in 2002-2003), well below the </p><p>industry capacity of 468,000 tons.  (The industry capacity, </p><p>in turn, is below domestic market demand.)  Cargill reps have </p><p>told us that all of their corn syrup production goes to local </p><p>Pepsi and Coca Cola factories.  However, with such a low </p><p>production quota, they cannot meet the demand of the soft </p><p>drink makers.  Cargill reps claim that, should the low </p><p>production quotas continue, their Turkish operations cannot </p><p>survive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) This 10 percent quota was the result of a campaign </p><p>from sugar beet farmers (approximately 380,000 of them) and </p><p>SEKER to limit the competition during SEKER\'s transformation </p><p>process.  "There is a very strong political constituency to </p><p>maintain sugar beet factories and employment within them," </p><p>according to a World Bank official here.  The </p><p>cornstarch-based industry successfully lobbied the Council of </p><p>Ministers to increase the quota to 15 percent for this year, </p><p>or 351,000 MT.  The industry is pushing the Council of </p><p>Ministers to continue the 15 percent quota into next year - </p><p>the quota is scheduled to return to the 10 percent mark in </p><p>September. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Cornstarch-based industry reps are also complaining </p><p>that the GOT has assigned quota percentages for sugar and </p><p>cornstarch-based sweeteners under a common umbrella.  Most </p><p>countries, including those in the EU, have separate </p><p>production quotas for sugar and corn-starch based products. </p><p>That is because the weight of purified centrifugal sugar is </p><p>100 percent dry matter while fructose corn syrup is diluted </p><p>with 25 percent water.  Thus, by comparing the weights of </p><p>sugar and fructose corn syrup on a 1:1 scale, as the GOT </p><p>production quotas have done, the sugar industry has a </p><p>distinct advantage in how the quotas are weighed and </p><p>quantified, says Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) Turkish Rep. </p><p>Rint Akyuz.  "It\'s like measuring apples and oranges," he </p><p>said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SEKER Privatization Scheduled for 2004 </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The privatization of SEKER\'s sugar refineries, </p><p>which has been postponed twice in the past, is scheduled to </p><p>begin shortly.  In early April, State Minister for Treasury </p><p>Ali Babacan said the road map for the privatization of </p><p>SEKER\'s sugar factories was expected to be approved by the </p><p>High Privatization Council by the end of June. (The Council </p><p>is comprised of PM Erdogan, Babacan, Coskun, Finance Minister </p><p>Unakitan, and Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim. </p><p>Yildirim was the most recent appointee, unseating Deputy PM </p><p>Sener.)  Coskun said April 18 that the privatization calendar </p><p>for SEKER\'s 27 sugar refineries would be submitted to the IMF </p><p>by June 30.  He added that the GOT was planning to sell </p><p>redundant and unused assets, and use the proceeds to </p><p>strengthen the company and make it more attractive for </p><p>investors.  As an example of redundant assets, Coskun said </p><p>the GOT was planning to sell the farmland in Ankara Etimesgut </p><p>Sugar Factory to Ankara Municipality and the Union of </p><p>Chambers and Stock Exchanges (TOBB). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Ahmet Aksu, the Privatization Administration (PA) </p><p>official responsible for the SEKER sale, gave us similar </p><p>information on April 15.  He said the GOT is still working to </p><p>consolidate roughly $500 million in debts owed to the </p><p>Treasury Ministry.  He added that the 27 factories will most </p><p>likely be sold in 5-6 separate blocks.  SEKER\'s total assets </p><p>in 2001 were $1.4 billion (per website www.turkseker.gov.tr). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Political obstacles to liberalization and </p><p>privatization of Turkey\'s sugar industry are similar to those </p><p>of other state-owned monsters like TEKEL (reftel).  In this </p><p>case, Turkey\'s inefficient sugar industry employs some 20,000 </p><p>workers, as well as 380,000 farmers, and the political cost </p><p>of offending this constituency is huge.  The sugar </p><p>establishment is hindering GOT efforts to liberalize the </p><p>market, and the net effect are government losses in the form </p><p>of high storage prices, private industry losses in the form </p><p>of unjust production quotas, and consumer losses in the form </p><p>of higher prices.  Given the political pressure to continue </p><p>protective measures for the sugar industry, successful </p><p>privatization of SEKER over the next 12 months will be a true </p><p>test of the GOT\'s commitment toward free market reforms. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
