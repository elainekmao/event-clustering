(SBU)  SUMMARY.  THE VISIT BY PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG </p><p>TO BURMA UNDERSCORED A SHARED DETERMINATION TO ADVANCE THE </p><p>MODEST TIES BETWEEN THESE TWO FELLOW ASEAN STATES.  A MAJOR </p><p>FOCUS WAS ON THE STILL LIMITED ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP; </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE IS ONLY ABOUT USD 10 MILLION ANNUALLY. </p><p>NARCOTICS WERE APPARENTLY NOT ON THE AGENDA, BUT THE TWO </p><p>SIDES AFFIRMED THEIR SUPPORT FOR INCREASED EFFORTS TO </p><p>COUNTER INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, WHILE CAVEATING THAT SUCH </p><p>EFFORTS SHOULD NOT COMPROMISE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG VISITED BURMA FROM MAY 5-8 </p><p>AT THE INVITATION OF SENIOR GENERAL THAN SHWE, CHAIRMAN OF </p><p>BURMA\'S STATE PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL (SPDC).  HIS </p><p>DELEGATION INCLUDED FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY NIEN, </p><p>MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT LE HUY NGO, </p><p>AND THE DEPUTY MINISTERS OF DEFENSE, PLANNING AND </p><p>INVESTMENT, AND TRADE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>A "LANDMARK," SORT OF </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>.  (SBU)  MFA SENIOR ASIA II EXPERT PHAM NGO THUAN WHO </p><p>ACCOMPANIED THE DELEGATION, DESCRIBED THE VISIT AS A </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01279  01 OF 02  200954Z </p><p>"LANDMARK," NOTING THIS WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VISIT </p><p>FROM VIETNAM SINCE HO CHI MINH VISITED BURMA IN 1958.  ONE </p><p>BURMA EMBOFF NOTED THAT RANGOON HAD PUSHED FOR THE VISIT </p><p>BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY ASEAN COUNTRY THAT LUONG HAD YET TO </p><p>VISIT.  ACCORDING TO VU QUANG THIEN, SENIOR RESEARCHER AT </p><p>THE SOUTH EAST ASIA STUDIES CENTER, THE POLITICAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH BURMA IS "LONG AND ENDURING," WITH THE </p><p>CONSULAR RELATIONSHIP DATING BACK TO 1957 AND AMBASSADORIAL </p><p>TIES GOING BACK TO 1975. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  ANOTHER BURMA EMBOFF NOTED THAT THE TRADE VOLUME, </p><p>WHILE STILL "NEGLIGIBLE" AT USD 10 MILLION LAST YEAR, COULD </p><p>"EASILY INCREASE" TO USD 100 MILLION "WITHIN TWO TO THREE </p><p>YEARS," ESPECIALLY IF SOME JOINT VENTURES DISCUSSED DURING </p><p>THE VISIT WORK OUT.  THESE INCLUDED OIL EXPLORATION, GEM </p><p>MARKETING, AND RICE MARKETING.  HE INDICATED THAT IN THE </p><p>NEAR TERM, THE TWO SIDES WILL TRY TO INCREASE BARTER TRADE, </p><p>SINCE RAISING CAPITAL IS VERY DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY ON THE </p><p>BURMESE SIDE.  VIETNAMESE EXPORTS NOW INCLUDE BUILDING </p><p>MATERIALS, CERAMIC TILE, AND COMMODITIES SUCH AS PLASTICS, </p><p>INSTANT NOODLES, AND SOAP.  THE EMBOFF PREDICTED THAT </p><p>VIETNAMESE CONSUMER GOODS WOULD BE WELL RECEIVED IN BURMA </p><p>SINCE THEY WOULD BE CHEAPER THAN THOSE PRODUCED IN THAILAND </p><p>AND INDIA OR EVEN, IN MANY CASES, IN CHINA.  BURMESE EXPORTS </p><p>ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN LIMITED TO TIMBER AND SOME AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PRODUCTS.  CURRENTLY, TRADE RUNS HEAVILY IN VIETNAM\'S FAVOR, </p><p>WITH ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE VALUE OF TWO-WAY TRADE </p><p>CONSISTING OF VIETNAM\'S EXPORTS TO BURMA, ACCORDING TO </p><p>EMBOFF. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  THE TWO SIDES SIGNED AN MOU TO FORM A "JOINT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01279  01 OF 02  200954Z </p><p>ECONOMIC WORKING GROUP" TO PUSH BILATERAL TRADE.  THE FIRST </p><p>MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN HANOI THIS JULY.  THIS </p><p>GROUP WILL BE ORGANIZED THROUGH THE RESPECTIVE MINISTRIES OF </p><p>TRADE.  THE MFA\'S THUAN NOTED THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE </p><p>ECONOMIC WORKING GROUP IS "AN IMPORTANT STEP" TO IMPROVING </p><p>THE OVERALL RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>NO CONNECTION WITH AUNG SAN SUU KYI\'S RELEASE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  DURING THE VISIT, AUNG SAN SUU KYI WAS RELEASED </p><p>FROM HOUSE ARREST.  BOTH THE MFAS THUAN AND THE BURMA </p><p>EMBOFF NOTED THAT THE SIMULANEOUS RELEASE OF AUNG SAN SUU </p><p>KYI WAS ONLY A COINCIDENCE; NEGOTIATIONS HAD BEEN ONGOING </p><p>"FOR MONTHS."  ACCORDING TO THUAN, LUONG DID NOT COMMENT ON </p><p>HER RELEASE DURING ANY OF HIS TALKS WITH THE BURMESE </p><p>LEADERSHIP, NOR WAS THE SUBJECT RAISED BY HIS INTERLOCUTORS. </p><p>THUAN </p><p></p></div>
