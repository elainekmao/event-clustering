USAID/PPC\'S HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE ADVISOR VISITED ROME </p><p>JANUARY 20-23, 2002 TO PROMOTE THE USE OF CRUDE MORTALITY </p><p>RATE (CMR) AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF CHILDREN UNDER FIVE AS </p><p>PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN THE U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM\'S </p><p>(WFP) RELIEF ACTIVITIES. THESE MEETINGS RESULTED IN WFP\'S </p><p>AGREEMENT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE USE OF THESE INDICATORS </p><p>AT PILOT SITES.  THERE WAS GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT ONE OF </p><p>THESE SITES WOULD BE IN AFGHANISTAN, SUBJECT TO </p><p>CONSULTATIONS WITH WFP FIELD OFFICES WORKING DIRECTLY ON </p><p>THE AFGHANISTAN PROGRAM. WFP\'S WORKING GROUP ON THE RELIEF </p><p>INDICATORS WILL SELECT THE OTHER PILOT COUNTRIES IN </p><p>CONSULTATION WITH USAID. THIS CABLE REPORTS ON MAJOR </p><p>CONCLUSIONS AND OUTCOMES OF PPC\'S MEETINGS AT WFP AND THE </p><p>UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO).  IT ALSO </p><p>IDENTIFIES ISSUES AND CONCERNS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE </p><p>INDICATORS THAT WARRANT FURTHER DISCUSSION. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN 1999, USAID ADOPTED CRUDE MORTALITY RATE (NUMBER OF </p><p>DEATHS/10,000 PERSONS/DAY) AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS (WEIGHT </p><p>FOR HEIGHT) OF CHILDREN UNDER FIVE AS PERFORMANCE </p><p>INDICATORS FOR RELIEF ACTIVITIES.  SINCE THIS TIME, </p><p>USAID/PPC HAS SOUGHT COLLABORATION FROM STATE/PRM TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00817  01 OF 04  151703Z </p><p>JOINTLY WORK WITH USAID PARTNERS (PVOS/NGOS, INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER DONORS) TO ADOPT THESE INDICATORS; </p><p>IDENTIFY PILOT SITES; DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY FOR CONDUCTING </p><p>SURVEYS; AND INITIATE DATA COLLECTION. IN 2000, STATE/PRM </p><p>INCLUDED CMR IN ITS BUREAU PERFORMANCE PLAN AS ONE OF ITS </p><p>PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ANNE RALTE, USAID/PPC, MADE A TDY TO ROME, GENEVA AND </p><p>BRUSSELS ON JANUARY 20 - 31, 2002 TO ENCOURAGE ADOPTION OF </p><p>THESE INDICATORS TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE IN RELIEF </p><p>ACTIVITIES BY THE USG\'S HUMANITARIAN U.N. PARTNERS, </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE EU.  DURING THE TDY </p><p>MS. RALTE ALSO COORDINATED ON OPERATIONAL ISSUES SUCH AS </p><p>THE PROVISION OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING FOR DATA </p><p>COLLECTION, ANALYSIS AND REPORTING ON INDICATORS.  (NOTE: </p><p>MS. RALTE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY PAULA LYNCH, DEPUTY DIRECTOR </p><p>FOR POLICY AND RESOURCES, STATE/PRM, IN BOTH GENEVA AND </p><p>BRUSSELS.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN ROME, MS. RALTE FOCUSSED HER EFFORTS ON THE ADOPTION </p><p>OF THESE INDICATORS BY THE U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP), </p><p>BUILDING UPON PAST DISCUSSIONS WITH WFP ON THIS ISSUE. </p><p>(NOTE: MENTION WAS MADE OF THESE INDICATORS AT LAST YEAR\'S </p><p>WFP EXECUTIVE BOARD MEETINGS AND THEY WERE BRIEFLY </p><p>DISCUSSED AT USG/WFP BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS IN APRIL 2001. </p><p>AT THESE MEETINGS, WFP AGREED TO CONDUCT SOME PILOT STUDIES </p><p>USING THE INDICATORS SUBSEQUENT TO USAID/WFP TECHNICAL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE PLANNED FOR SEPTEMBER, BUT </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY POSTPONED BY USAID UNTIL JANUARY.)  MS. </p><p>RALTE\'S CONSULTATIONS INCLUDED INTRODUCTORY AND CLOSING </p><p>PLENARY SESSIONS AND MEETINGS WITH INDIVIDUAL STAFF MEMBERS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00817  01 OF 04  151703Z </p><p>COLLABORATING ON THIS EFFORT.  WFP DIVISIONS PARTICIPATING </p><p>IN THESE MEETINGS INCLUDED THE STRATEGY AND POLICY DIVISION </p><p>(SP), THE OPERATIONS DIVISION (OD), THE OFFICE OF </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS(OHA), THE VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS AND </p><p>MAPPING UNIT (VAM), THE OFFICE OF EVALUATION (OEDE) AND THE </p><p>RESOURCES MOBILIZATION SERVICE - AMERICAS, AUSTRALIA AND </p><p>ASIA (REA). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSIONS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. THE OUTCOME OF THESE MEETINGS WAS AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-- WFP AND USAID AGREED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DATA </p><p>COLLECTION FOR THESE INDICATORS AT PILOT SITES. </p><p> </p><p>-- THERE WAS TENTATIVE AGREEMENT THAT ONE OF THE PILOT </p><p>SITES WOULD BE IN AFGHANISTAN, SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION AND </p><p>CONCURRENCE FROM WFP\'S CLUSTER OFFICE FOR AFGHANISTAN IN </p><p>ISLAMABAD.  (SEE PARAS 9-11 BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF </p><p>AFGHANISTAN). </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0622 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00817  02 OF 04  151704Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00   OIGO-00  E-00     UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  VCE-00   NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  ECA-00   SNIS-00  NISC-00  PRM-00   SAS-00 </p><p>        /003W </p><p>                  ------------------67970F  151708Z /38 </p><p>P 151635Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 2263 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2548 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 04 ROME 000817 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO AND PRM </p><p>USAID FOR DCHA/FFP, DCHA/OFDA AND PPC </p><p>GENEVA FOR NKYLOH/USAID </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR KFULLER/USAID </p><p>USUN FOR LSHESTACK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, WFP, UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FOR RELIEF ACTIVITIES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00817  02 OF 04  151704Z </p><p> </p><p>-- THE POSSIBILITY OF SETTING UP PILOTS IN SUDAN AND THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO WAS ALSO DISCUSSED, BUT NO </p><p>DECISION WAS REACHED. THE REMAINING SITES WILL BE SELECTED </p><p>FROM A LIST OF TEN POSSIBLE COUNTRY SITES DEVELOPED BY AN </p><p>INTERNAL WFP WORKING GROUP.  FINAL SELECTION WILL BE BASED </p><p>ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING GEOGRAPHICAL </p><p>REPRESENTATION, TYPE OF PROGRAM (PRRO OR EMOP) AND </p><p>IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS. WFP WILL ALSO SEEK TO INCLUDE </p><p>COUNTRIES WHERE A VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT MAPPING UNIT </p><p>(VAM) IS PRESENT TO INCORPORATE FOOD SECURITY AND </p><p>VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT DATA. </p><p> </p><p>--  WFP AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN A WORKSHOP ON SURVEY </p><p>METHODOLOGY, BEING PLANNED BY USAID, STATE/PRM AND THE </p><p>CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY (CIDA).  THE </p><p>WORKSHOP, TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR JUNE/JULY 2002, WILL BE </p><p>AIMED AT STANDARDIZING NUTRITIONAL SURVEY METHODOLOGIES, </p><p>THAT INCORPORATE DATA COLLECTION ON CMR, TO ENSURE </p><p>RELIABILITY OF DATA. </p><p> </p><p>-- IF WFP FINDS COLLECTION OF DATA ON THESE INDICATORS </p><p>FEASIBLE, WFP WILL CONSIDER HOW IT CAN INTEGRATE THEM INTO </p><p>ITS STRATEGIC PLAN FOR 2003-2007, AS PART OF WFP\'S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO MAKE ITS STRATEGIC PLAN MORE RESULTS-BASED. </p><p>(NOTE:  THIS WOULD MEAN PILOT TESTING WOULD HAVE TO BE </p><p>COMPLETE BY THE FALL OF 2002.) </p><p> </p><p>-- WFP DID NOT FEEL IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO INCLUDE THESE </p><p>INDICATORS IN ITS MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU\'S) WITH </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00817  02 OF 04  151704Z </p><p>ITS NGO IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS UNTIL THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE </p><p>WITH PILOT TESTING THE INDICATORS. </p><p> </p><p>-- WFP AND FAO REPRESENTATIVES RECOMMENDED THAT NUTRITION </p><p>AND CMR DATA SHOULD BE INTERPRETED IN A MUCH WIDER CONTEXT </p><p>OF FOOD SECURITY AND VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>ISSUES </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  THROUGHOUT THESE CONSULTATIONS, WFP IDENTIED COST AS </p><p>THE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO WFP\'S INTEGRATING NUTRITIONAL </p><p>STATUS/CMR MONITORING INTO ALL ITS RELIEF PROGRAMS.  FOR </p><p>THIS REASON, WFP PLANNED TO TAKE A GRADUAL APPROACH, WHICH </p><p>WOULD ALLOW FOR FURTHER EVALUATION OF COSTS AFTER PILOT </p><p>TESTING. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE RELATED ISSUE OF TECHNICAL CAPACITY OF WFP AND ITS </p><p>IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION WAS ALSO </p><p>RAISED.  WFP CURRENTLY HAS VERY LIMITED FIELD STAFF </p><p>CAPACITY IN MONITORING AND NUTRITION AND HAS ONLY ONE (1) </p><p>MONITORING OFFICER AND TWO (2) NUTRITION OFFICERS AT ITS </p><p>HEADQUARTERS IN ROME. THE HIRING OF ADDITIONAL STAFF AND </p><p>TRAINING OF EXISTING STAFF ALL HAVE RESOURCE IMPLICATIONS. </p><p>IN ADDITION, WFP NOTED THAT MANY OF ITS NGO IMPLEMENTING </p><p>PARTNERS ARE FOCUSSED ON FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND LOGISTICS </p><p>RATHER THAN HEALTH AND NUTRITION.  ADDITIONAL RESOURCES </p><p>WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT GREATER NGO INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>HEALTH/NUTRITION ACTIVITIES. MS. RALTE EMPHASIZED THAT WFP </p><p>SHOULD TRY TO MAKE THE MOST OF ITS LINKAGES WITH TECHNICAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00817  02 OF 04  151704Z </p><p>PARTNERS TO COLLECT NUTRITIONAL/CMR DATA RATHER THAN </p><p>COLLECTING THESE DATA THEMSELVES. IN ADDITION, SHE </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT THESE INDICATORS BE INCORPORATED INTO </p><p>PROJECT MONITORING ON AN INCREMENTAL BASIS, WITH NEW </p><p>SITES/COUNTRIES ADDED EACH YEAR. PILOT TESTING OF THESE </p><p>INDICATORS WILL GIVE WFP AND USAID A BETTER IDEA OF </p><p>TECHNICAL NEEDS AND RELATED COSTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ANOTHER ISSUE IS THE DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>NUTRITIONAL STATUS MONITORING BETWEEN WFP AND ITS PARTNERS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY OTHER U.N. AGENCIES, SUCH AS UNICEF.  WFP\'S </p><p>CURRENT MOU WITH UNICEF GIVES UNICEF THE  RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR NUTRITIONAL SURVEYS IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE TWO AGENCIES </p><p>ARE WORKING.  BROADER ACCEPTANCE AND COLLABORATION ON THESE </p><p>INDICATORS BY OTHER U.N. AGENCIES AND OTHER DONORS WILL </p><p>FACILITATE WFP\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH ITS PARTNERS.  THE </p><p>DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR NUTRITIONAL MONITORING IS AN </p><p>ISSUE THAT PARTICULARLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN (SEE BELOW). </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>AFGHANISTAN </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0635 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00817  03 OF 04  151704Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  EB-00    EUR-00   OIGO-00  E-00     UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  VCE-00   DCP-01   NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   IRM-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  ECA-00   SNIS-00  NISC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------67973D  151709Z /38 </p><p>P 151635Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 2264 </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2549 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 000817 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO AND PRM </p><p>USAID FOR DCHA/FFP, DCHA/OFDA AND PPC </p><p>GENEVA FOR NKYLOH/USAID </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR KFULLER/USAID </p><p>USUN FOR LSHESTACK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, WFP, UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FOR RELIEF ACTIVITIES </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00817  03 OF 04  151704Z </p><p> </p><p>9.  MS. RALTE PARTICIPATED IN A SEPARATE SESSION WITH WFP </p><p>PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN WFP\'S AFGHANISTAN PROGRAM.  IN JULY/ </p><p>AUGUST 2001, WFP\'S VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS AND MAPPING UNIT </p><p>(VAM) CARRIED OUT A FOOD SECURITY ASSESSMENT IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>THAT ANALYZED THE EFFECTS OF THE DROUGHT FOR THE PAST THREE </p><p>YEARS ON FOOD PRODUCTION AND ON PEOPLE\'S ABILITY TO COPE </p><p>WITH THE SITUATION.  SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, WFP HAS BEEN </p><p>MAKING EFFORTS TO UPDATE THIS ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVE ITS </p><p>MONITORING CAPABILITIES IN AFGHANISTAN THROUGH THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF A AFGHANISTAN FOOD SECURITY UNIT (AFSU) IN </p><p>ISLAMABAD THAT WILL BUILD THE VAM UNIT\'S CAPACITY FOR FOOD </p><p>SECURITY ANALYSIS, INFORMATION SHARING AND NETWORKING. </p><p> </p><p>10.  CURRENTLY, WFP IS MONITORING BENEFICIARY LEVELS AND </p><p>VARIOUS TYPES OF FOOD SECURITY INFORMATION AND UPDATES THIS </p><p>INFORMATION ON A REGULAR BASIS.  WFP REVIEWS NUTRITIONAL </p><p>SURVEYS BEING CARRIED OUT BY VARIOUS NGOS WITH THEIR OWN </p><p>FUNDING SOURCES. METHODOLOGIES BEING USED ARE NOT </p><p>STANDARDIZED.  WFP IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS TO ESTABLISH A SUSTAINABLE NUTRITION </p><p>SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM THAT WILL ENSURE THERE IS </p><p>STANDARDIZATION AND COORDINATION AMONG VARIOUS GROUPS </p><p>CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING SURVEYS.  AS PART OF THIS EFFORT, WFP </p><p>IS WORKING OUT RESPONSIBILITIES WITH OTHER U.N. PARTNERS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY UNICEF. AS AN INTERIM MEASURE, UNTIL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES COULD BE BETTER DEFINED, WFP PROPOSED TO </p><p>ENGAGE A NEUTRAL, CREDIBLE INSTITUTION WITH WIDELY </p><p>RESPECTED EXPERTISE IN NUTRITIONAL SURVEYS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC), TO </p><p>COORDINATE SURVEYS WITH UNICEF AND ENSURE THAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00817  03 OF 04  151704Z </p><p>METHODOLOGIES ARE STANDARDIZED AND DATA ARE RELIABLE. THIS </p><p>PROPOSAL WAS ENDORSED BY USAID.  WFP AGREED TO DISCUSS THIS </p><p>PROPOSAL TO USE CDC WITH ITS CLUSTER OFFICE FOR AFGHANISTAN </p><p>IN ISLAMABAD. FRANCESCO STRIPOLI, THE DIRECTOR OF WFP\'S </p><p>OFFICE OF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS, WILL TAKE THE LEAD ON </p><p>FURTHER ARRANGEMENTS TO MEET IMMEDIATE PRIORITY NEEDS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>MEETING WITH FAO </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE U.S. MISSION ORGANIZED A CONSULTATIVE SESSION WITH </p><p>FAO, CHAIRED BY FAO\'S SPECIAL RELIEF OPERATIONS SERVICE </p><p>(TCOR), WHICH RECEIVES USAID OFFICE OF FOREIGN DISASTER </p><p>ASSISTANCE (OFDA) FUNDING.  THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING WAS </p><p>TO BRIEF FAO ON THESE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FOR RELIEF </p><p>PROGRAMS, EXPLAIN WHY THESE WERE SELECTED, AND DISCUSS HOW </p><p>THEY WERE BEING USED FOR MONITORING PROGRESS. USAID HAS NOT </p><p>REQUESTED THAT FAO REPORT ON THESE INDICATORS FOR FAO </p><p>RELIEF PROGRAMS FUNDED BY USAID. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THIS MEETING INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE </p><p>FOLLOWING OFFICES AT FAO: NUTRITION PLANNING, ASSESSMENT </p><p>AND EVALUATION SERVICE (ESNA); AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SERVICE (ESAE); FOOD SECURITY AND </p><p>AGRICULTURAL PROJECTS ANALYSIS SERVICE (ESAF); NUTRITION </p><p>PROGRAM SERVICES (ESNP); AND EVALUATION SERVICE (PBEE). FAO </p><p>ADVISED THAT IT IS IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING ITS SIX YEAR </p><p>MEDIUM PLAN AND FOUND THE CONSULTATION TIMELY AND HELPFUL. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00817  03 OF 04  151704Z </p><p>THEY APPLAUDED USAID, AS A MAJOR DONOR, FOR MAKING </p><p>NUTRITIONAL STATUS ONE OF ITS AGENCY GOAL INDICATORS.
