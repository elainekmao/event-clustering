Foreign Minister Graham </p><p>issued a press release on January 10 (available at </p><p>www.dfait.gc.ca) deploring this announcement, underscoring </p><p>the importance of the NPT, and urging the DPRK to reverse its </p><p>decision.  Ron Stansfield of Foreign Affairs\' Nuclear and </p><p>Chemical Disarmament Agency told us that the GoC also has </p><p>tried to contact the DPRK privately to encourage them not to </p><p>follow through, but has gotten no response.  Stansfield said </p><p>the GoC expected that after UN Security Council </p><p>consideration, action would move back to the IAEA, and </p><p>wondered what steps could be taken then.  He said the GoC </p><p>will continue to work in multilateral fora to encourage the </p><p>DPRK to step back before its NPT withdrawal becomes </p><p>"official" on April 9. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
