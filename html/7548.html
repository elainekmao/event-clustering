<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001679 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR TF, PMAT, EUR, EUR/WE, AND EUR/PRA </p><p>    PLEASE PASS TO OSD/POLICY, JOINT STAFF/YIKE, EUCOM/RIZZO, </p><p>CENTCOM, NSC/VOLKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, EAID, IT, IZ, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: ITALIANS DISCUSS BRIGADE AND CARABINIERI </p><p>FOR IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 98807 </p><p> </p><p>     B. ROME 1660 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING/DEPUTYCHIEF OF MISSION THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REA </p><p>SONS .5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE ITALIAN LNO AT TAMPA, GENERL SANTINI, IS EXPECTED </p><p>TO PRESENT THE ITALIAN MIITARY\'S PROPOSAL -- TO CONTRIBUTE A </p><p>BRIGADE AS WEL AS CARABINIERI UNITS FOR IRAQ OPERATIONS -- </p><p>TOCENTCOM AS EARLY AS APRIL 18, ONCE THE PLAN HAS BEN </p><p>APPROVED BY THE CHOD.  BASED ON OUR APRIL 17 METING WITH THE </p><p>UK EMBASSY\'S DCM, SCOTT WIGHTMAN,POL-MIL OFFICER NICK </p><p>HOPTON, AND RAF REPRESENTATIE CHRIS PURKISS, WE UNDERSTAND </p><p>THAT THE ITALIANSAND BRITISH HAVE HAD HIGH-LEVEL MIL-TO-MIL </p><p>DISCUSIONS ON THE PROPOSAL, MOST RECENTLY IN LONDON ON PRIL </p><p>15.  WIGHTMAN SAID THE ITALIANS HAVE OFFERE -- SUBJECT TO </p><p>GOI POLITICAL APPROVAL -- A BRIGADE THAT CAN DEPLOY WITHIN </p><p>ONE MONTH TO OPERATE WES OR NORTH OF BASRA IN THE BRITISH </p><p>ZONE.  OF THAT A UNIT OF 800 BERSAGLIERE SOLDIERS CAN DEPLOY </p><p>WTHIN 48 HOURS.  THE ITALIAN PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDESTHE </p><p>GARIBALDI HEADQUARTERS UNIT, AND 400-500 CARABINIERI PREPARED </p><p>TO SERVE AS MSUS IN THE BAGHDAD REA.  A TEAM OF BRITISH </p><p>MILITARY PLANNERS WILL BE IN ROME ON APRIL 23 TO WORK OUT </p><p>    ADDITIONAL DETAILS WITH THE ITALIANS.  THE BRITISH AND THE </p><p>ITALIANS WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE PROPOSAL FITS WITH CENTCOM </p><p>PLANNING. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) AFTER CONSULTING WITH LONDON LATER ON APRIL 17, HOPTON </p><p>SAID THAT HIS AMBASSADOR PLANNED TO ENCOURAGE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BERLUSCONI TO APPROVE A RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF THE BRIGADE AND </p><p>CARABINIERI TO THE BRITISH ZONE WHEN THEY MET AT AN EVENT </p><p>THAT EVENING.  HIS GOVERNMENT WAS CONFIDENT THAT THIS WOULD </p><p>RESULT IN THE POLITICAL APPROVAL THE ITALIAN MILITARY HAS </p><p>BEEN SEEKING, PARTICULARLY SINCE PM BLAIR AND BERLUSCONI HAD </p><p>DISCUSSED  THE IRAQ SITUATION (AND ESDP) IN ATHENS ON APRIL </p><p>16, HOPTON EXPLAINED.  (NOTE: THE BRITISH EMBASSY IS CLOSED </p><p>ON APRIL 18 AND WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REACH WIGHTMAN OR </p><p>HOPTON FOR A READ-OUT ON THE AMBASSADOR\'S EXCHANGE WITH THE </p><p>PM.  WE ARE FOLLOWING UP.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COMMENT.  THE MOD AND THE GOI\'S INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE </p><p>HAVE PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED A PREFERENCE TO HAVE ITALY\'S </p><p>NATIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS CO-LOCATED.  OUR DISCUSSIONS TO DATE </p><p>INDICATE, HOWEVER, THAT THE DEFENSE STAFF PROPOSES TO PUT A </p><p>BRIGADE IN THE BRITISH ZONE AND CARABINIERI IN THE BAGHDAD </p><p>AREA, WHILE THE TASK FORCE IS OFFERING A RED CROSS FIELD </p><p>HOSPITAL AND OTHER EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR BAGHDAD, TO BE </p><p>PROTECTED BY ITALIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL.  THE ITALIANS (AND </p><p>WE) HAVE BEEN SEEKING GUIDANCE ON WHERE CENTCOM WANTS TO </p><p>LOCATE THE BRIGADE, THE CARB UNITS AND THE FIELD HOSPITAL SO </p><p>THEY CAN TAILOR THEIR PROPOSAL ACCORDINGLY.  OUR BRITISH </p><p>COLLEAGUES PREDICT THAT, DURING THE MILITARY PLANNING MEETING </p><p>ON APRIL 23, THE GOI WILL ADJUST ITS PACKAGE SO THAT THE </p><p>BRIGADE AND THE CARABINIERI UNITS BOTH OPERATE IN THE BRITISH </p><p>    ZONE, ASSUMING THAT FITS WITH CENTCOM\'S PLAN.  WE NOTE </p><p>INFORMAL DEPARTMENT REPORTS THAT FIELD HOSPITALS ARE </p><p>ESPECIALLY NEEDED IN AREAS OTHER THAN BAGHDAD, AND ARE </p><p>HOPEFUL THAT THE ITALIANS MAY BE WILLING TO LOCATE THEIR </p><p>HOSPITAL (REFEL B) IN THE BRITISH ZONE IN ORDER TO </p><p>CONSOLIDATE ITALY\'S NATIONAL CONTRIBUTION.  IF THAT MEETS </p><p>CENTCOM OBJECTIVES, WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE TASK FORCE TO MAKE </p><p>THE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01679 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
