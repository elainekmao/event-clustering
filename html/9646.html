<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004590 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- Lead stories in all papers today, July 24, carry </p><p>reports about the U.S. Department of Defense\'s </p><p>confirmation of the death of Uday and Qusay, Saddam </p><p>Hussein\'s sons.  Major editorial commentaries </p><p>characterized the deaths as "killings" by U.S. forces </p><p>and offered praise for the resistance of the two sons, </p><p>irrespective of their acknowledged horrible treatment </p><p>of their fellow Iraqis when in power. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Reconciliation not blood" </p><p> </p><p>Centrist, influential among the elite English daily </p><p>Jordan Times (07/24) editorializes:  "The killing of </p><p>Saddam Hussein\'s two sons Uday and Qusay at the hands </p><p>of U.S. soldiers might be an important development, </p><p>but it certainly is nothing to brag about.  True, the </p><p>two Iraqis were on the `most wanted list\' and their </p><p>elimination may have brought the United States closer </p><p>to its declared objective of canceling any remnants of </p><p>the former Baath regime, but ending their lives will </p><p>not, by itself, restore law and order to Iraq. </p><p>Besides, summary executions and political killings </p><p>represent the way and style of governance of the old </p><p>Iraqi regime and must not be the hallmark of the new </p><p>Iraqi order.  Saddam\'s sons should have been brought </p><p>to justice for their terrible record of violence, </p><p>atrocities and repression against their people. </p><p>Arresting them would have served the interests of Iraq </p><p>much more than taking away their lives..  Uday and </p><p>Qusay\'s killing will not change the picture unless the </p><p>more basic issues and challenges are dealt with </p><p>appropriately." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The killing of the President\'s sons" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Jamil Nimri writes on the back-page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(07/24):  "I thought it was completely inappropriate </p><p>for official statements to be issued from capitals </p><p>such as Washington, London and Tehran expressing </p><p>`reassurance\' at the news of killing the sons of the </p><p>former Iraqi President.  Every killing incident is a </p><p>painful and tragic incident and must not be, </p><p>officially, expressed in terms of reassurance.  I can </p><p>understand that thousands of Iraqis wished to have the </p><p>most horrible act of vengeance against Uday for </p><p>instance because of his actions, but states apprehend </p><p>people to achieve justice and do not rejoice at </p><p>killings..  The killing of the President\'s sons and </p><p>grandson is received with a mixture of vague and </p><p>contradictory feelings..  In a regime of tyranny where </p><p>one official kisses up to those above and terrorizes </p><p>those below him, it is difficult to anticipate how </p><p>these people will behave at the end.  There are those </p><p>who, when in their position of power and authority, </p><p>are brutal and murderous, but turn into cowards and </p><p>scoundrels when their own life is at stake.  This is </p><p>what happened to the tens of leaders in Iraq, but it </p><p>is quite different with the President and his sons. </p><p>We have no idea what Saddam\'s end will be like, but we </p><p>do know that his sons were not finished off in a scene </p><p>of pity and contempt.  They did not allow themselves </p><p>to be humiliated, like running out of Iraq, getting </p><p>caught and handcuffed by the coalition forces, or even </p><p>surrendering..  It is a tragic existence.  We </p><p>reiterate our rejection of this type of character in </p><p>the ruling position [harsh and brutal], but we take </p><p>off our hats and bow in silence when a person who is a </p><p>fighter dies without bargaining or humiliation." </p><p> </p><p>-- "When the President falls" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan writes on the back-page of </p><p>independent, mass-appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>(07/24):  "The end of Uday and Qusay is in line with </p><p>their personal nature and their position in authority. </p><p>They fought the American occupation forces </p><p>courageously and did not surrender as others who have </p><p>shared Saddam\'s power for 34 years did.  And if there </p><p>is a link between them and resistance operations, then </p><p>the way they were killed will make them martyrs in the </p><p>eyes of their followers from the resistance..  The </p><p>phenomenon of the flourishing hypocrisy among Saddam\'s </p><p>supporters that followed his downfall stresses not </p><p>only that the dictatorship is corrupt, but also that </p><p>it is capable of creating an army of hypocrites who </p><p>would abandon the leader the minute he falls and would </p><p>set on the humiliating path of changing allegiances </p><p>and trying to win the new masters.  It is a valuable </p><p>lesson from third world countries that have had enough </p><p>of torture and humiliation from dictatorships and the </p><p>absence of democracy.  It is also a valuable lesson </p><p>for the dictator who finishes off his countrymen, </p><p>excludes them from authority and marginalizes the </p><p>people, and then when the tables are turned, there is </p><p>no one around him." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Why assassinate and not put on trial?" </p><p> </p><p>Columnist Ibrahim Absi writes on the op-ed page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(07/24):  "The assassination of Uday and Qusay at the </p><p>hands of the American forces raises a number of </p><p>questions about the American reasons for killing them </p><p>and eliminating them so quickly and so dramatically.. </p><p>Was assassinating and killing them in an unequal </p><p>battle an American requirement to add more mystery and </p><p>sensationalism to the American game in Iraq or the </p><p>American crime in Iraq?..  The most sensational </p><p>objective of all in killing the Iraqi President\'s sons </p><p>is the U.S. administration\'s desire to achieve a media </p><p>victory for the sake of American public opinion. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
