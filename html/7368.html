Turkey launched a </p><p>diplomatic effort after the Peshmerge incursion and </p><p>incidents of looting being reported from Kirkuk.  Foreign </p><p>Minister Abdullah Gul called US Secretary of State Colin </p><p>Powell and told him that Turkey was ready to help if the US </p><p>was not able to cope with the turmoil.  However, Secretary </p><p>Powell rejected the offer and assured Turkey that the United </p><p>States would take the situation under control within a very </p><p>short period of time.  Prior to FM Gul\'s phone call, Foreign </p><p>Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Ali Tuygan called US </p><p>Ambassador Pearson twice to share Turkish concerns and to </p><p>reiterate the conditions of the Ankara declaration signed by </p><p>US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.  "Radikal" reports that TGS Chief </p><p>General Ozkok also called his counterpart, General Richard </p><p>Myers, to highlight Turkey\'s concerns.  "Milliyet" reports </p><p>that after the harsh reactions from the Turkish side, </p><p>Peshmerge militants started to leave Kirkuk in the evening, </p><p>and US troops penetrated Kirkuk and began to assert control. </p><p>"Hurriyet", "Zaman", and "Sabah" report that Turkish </p><p>military observers will go to Northern Iraq to monitor </p><p>developments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EU Reform Package: "Radikal" reports that the government is </p><p>undertaking new measures to meet EU accession criteria. </p><p>Within this framework, a new package of reforms has been </p><p>prepared by the Government which covers the expansion of </p><p>language freedom, amendments to Radio and TV broadcast laws, </p><p>and changes in housing and development regulations. </p><p>According to Justice Minister Cemil Cicek, the new package </p><p>would permit political propaganda to be made in Kurdish and </p><p>eliminate the ban on Kurdish-language private television and </p><p>radio stations.  It would also sharply reduce the scope of </p><p>Article 8 of Turkey\'s anti-terror law, which penalizes </p><p>certain `speech\' and `thought\' crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Why did the U.S. let them?" </p><p>Sedat Ergin commented in mass appeal Hurriyet (4/11): "It\'s </p><p>no secret that the Iraqi Kurds see Kirkuk as their capital, </p><p>and consider the town as the `Jerusalem of Kurdistan.\' </p><p>Encouraged by Barzani and Talabani, they\'ve attempted to get </p><p>recognition as `Kirkuk\'s liberators.\'  It\'s no coincidence </p><p>that they first targeted the deed office in town. .  It\'s </p><p>significant that the U.S., having managed to deter Kurds </p><p>from Kirkuk thus far, has suddenly removed this pressure. . </p><p>It is clear that U.S. has not even attempted to block Kurds\' </p><p>access to Kirkuk, because the U.S. Administration believes </p><p>that after Baghdad, the fall of Kirkuk will bring a faster </p><p>victory.  This attitude will intensify the doubts prevailing </p><p>among Turkish decision-makers and the people about the U.S., </p><p>and will further shake bilateral relations.  By silently </p><p>winking at the Kurds, the U.S. has carried them to an </p><p>advantageous position regarding Kurdish claims on Kirkuk. </p><p>In this way, the loyalty of the Northern Iraqi Kurdish </p><p>groups is being rewarded." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Kirkuk and the Kurds\' Korea" </p><p>Cengiz Candar opined in mass appeal Tercuman (4/11): "The </p><p>Kurds have established a close solidarity with the U.S. in </p><p>Northern Iraq, a relationship comparable to the cooperation </p><p>that was established between the U.S. and Turkey in Korea in </p><p>1952. .  By denying access to the 4th Infantry, Turkey has </p><p>made its ally America\'s job more difficult in Iraq, </p><p>increasing both the human and material costs.  What is more, </p><p>Turkey is seeking a rapprochement with Iran and Syria, </p><p>countries which, as Secretary Powell put it, create </p><p>`uneasiness\' for the U.S.  Whether through ongoing confusion </p><p>or a deliberate attempt by this government to undermine </p><p>Turkey\'s relations with the West, Turkey appears to be </p><p>seeking a place in the Third World. .  Turkey has blocked </p><p>the Northern Front, and the war was carried out only from </p><p>the South, resulting in the fall of Baghdad and Kirkuk </p><p>without fighting.  Are you still dreaming that the U.S. will </p><p>fight against the Kurds just to please Turkey?  Do you think </p><p>Turkey will enter Northern Iraq even though the U.S., just </p><p>like Turkey, has drawn some `red lines\' in the region? . </p><p>After having fought, with American support, in its Southeast </p><p>for 15 years, do you think Turkey, at odds with the U.S., </p><p>should venture a conflict with an unpredictable ending in </p><p>Northern Iraq?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
