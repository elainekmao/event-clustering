<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 000951 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PGOV, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: GOB\'S CONCERNS OVER AUGUST 7 SECURITY INCIDENT </p><p> </p><p>1.  Post has received information from the Department that </p><p>uniformed Secret Service arrested 3 Burmese students at the </p><p>Burmese embassy the morning of August 7 after they tried to </p><p>use a ladder to remove the Burmese flag and replace it with </p><p>their own (a Burmese dissident report on the incident said </p><p>they were attempting to unfurl a banner from a balcony that </p><p>said "EXPEL THE AMBASSADOR NOW").  There is also a vigil </p><p>planned by the students for 8:00 p.m. on August 8.  Post </p><p>understands that SS has beefed up security at the chancery </p><p>and the Ambassador\'s residence and that the Burmese will </p><p>request a permanent fixed post. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The COM was called to the Foreign Ministry late Friday </p><p>afternoon, August 8, to meet with the Director General for </p><p>Political Affairs.  The reason for the summons was to </p><p>express the GOB\'s concern over the incident detailed below. </p><p>The DG confirmed that the Burmese Embassy was receiving a </p><p>response to their request for extra security but wanted to </p><p>reiterate the GOB\'s concern, especially as it relates to </p><p>the intrusion into diplomatic premises.  The DG said they </p><p>could "deal with protests" but were worried that "things </p><p>could get out of hand".  The COM assured the DG that the </p><p>U.S. Government took its responsibility for protecting </p><p>diplomatic missions with the utmost seriousness and that </p><p>she would relay the GOB\'s concern to the Department. </p><p> </p><p>3.  As frequently noted in post\'s reporting on security </p><p>issues, the GOB is very responsive to our requests for </p><p>ongoing security at the Chancery, the American Center, and </p><p>diplomatic residential compounds and they have responded </p><p>positively and quickly to requests for enhanced security </p><p>for special events.  The GOB also provided a bodyguard </p><p>detail for the COM (and offered the same for other Embassy </p><p>senior officers) during the run-up to Iraq and until the </p><p>active fighting was declared over. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Action Request:  Given the physical vulnerabilities of </p><p>our aging USG facilities here, we need continued GOB </p><p>cooperation on security issues.  Post urges that GOB </p><p>requests for upgraded security be met with a timely </p><p>and effective response. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
