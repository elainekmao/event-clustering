<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002568 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OBASANJO BELIEVES NIGERIA WILL REMAIN </p><p>CALM OVER AFGHANISTAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER, REASON 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S) SUMMARY:  DURING AN OCTOBER 9 MEETING, PRESIDENT </p><p>OBASANJO, JOINED BY SPECIAL ADVISOR ADOBE OBE, EXPRESSED </p><p>CONFIDENCE THAT NIGERIA WOULD NOT EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS AS A RESULT OF COALITION STRIKES IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  HOWEVER, HE ADMITTED THAT NIGERIA HAD ISLAMIC </p><p>RADICALS WHO BEAR WATCHING.  IN THIS VEIN, OBASANJO STATED </p><p>THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO REIN IN ZAMFARA STATE GOVERNOR SANI WHO </p><p>CONTINUED TO BREW A VOLATILE MIX OF RELIGION AND POLITICS IN </p><p>HIS ECONOMICALLY BACKWARD STATE. </p><p>COMMENDING NIGERIAN SUPPORT FOR OUR MILITARY ACTION, </p><p>AMBASSADOR JETER ADVISED OBASANJO THAT NIGERIA NEEDED TO </p><p>TIGHTEN ITS MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS AS PART OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO FINANCIALLY SUFFOCATE THIS </p><p>TRANSNATIONAL THREAT.  WHILE ASKING FOR U.S. ASSISTANCE ON </p><p>MONEY LAUNDERING, OBASANJO ALSO HINTED THAT NIGERIA COULD </p><p>MODESTLY INCREASE OIL PRODUCTION, SHOULD PERSIAN GULF </p><p>PRODUCERS EXPERIENCE DISRUPTIONS.   END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) INITIALLY FIDGETING AND COMPLAINING OF A COLD, </p><p>PRESIDENT OBASANJO QUICKLY WARMED AS THE MEETING PROGRESSED. </p><p>AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF HIS OFFICE TELEVISION BROADCASTING </p><p>NEWS OF COALITION OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN, OBASANJO </p><p>PREDICTED THAT NIGERIA WOULD REMAIN CALM IN RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>MILITARY OPERATIONS.  LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE, THE COUNTRY HAD </p><p>ITS FRINGE ELEMENTS WHO WOULD TRY TO STOKE THE GENERAL </p><p>POPULATION;  HOWEVER, THIS TINY BUT BOISTEROUS MINORITY WOULD </p><p>NOT BE ABLE TO STIR THE PEOPLE WITH THEIR SOUR RHETORIC, HE </p><p>FORECASTED.  YET, HE ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR, NIGERIAN </p><p>SECURITY AGENCIES WERE CLOSELY WATCHING THESE FIREBRANDS, </p><p>LEST THEY RUN AMOK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  GIVING THE SUBJECT A BIT MORE THOUGHT AND NUANCE, </p><p>OBASANJO CAVEATED THAT THE LONGER COALITION OPERATIONS </p><p>LASTED, PARTICULARLY IF COUPLED WITH REPORTS OF CIVILIAN </p><p>CASUALTIES OR AN EXPANDED THEATER OF OPERATION, THEN NIGERIA </p><p>MIGHT EXPERIENCE SOME ANTI-AMERICAN PROTESTS.  OBASANJO </p><p>ADVISED THAT WE MUST RECOGNIZED THAT OIL PRODUCTION IN THE </p><p>GULF COULD BE AFFECTED SHOULD THE BATTLE AGAINST TERRORISM </p><p>ESCALATE SIGNIFICANTLY.  ALTHOUGH NIGERIA WAS NEAR MAXIMUM </p><p>CAPACITY, HE SUGGESTED THAT THE COUNTRY COULD PROBABLY </p><p>INCREASE PRODUCTION MODESTLY -- BY A QUARTER MILLION BARRELS </p><p>DAILY -- SHOULD THE EMERGENCY ARISE. AMBASSADOR JETER THANKED </p><p>OBASANJO FOR THE GESTURE, AND SAID THAT HE WOULD </p><p>CONFIDENTIALLY PASS THE WORD ON TO WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THEN NOTED THAT NIGERIA\'S MOST </p><p>IMMEDIATE SECURITY CONCERN WAS ZAMFARA STATE, WHICH SEEMED </p><p>TENSE FOR PURELY LOCAL REASONS.  AGREEING, THE PRESIDENT </p><p>FORCEFULLY DECLARED, "I HAVE TO DEAL WITH ZAMFARA."  HE </p><p>REMARKED THAT GOVERNOR SANI SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS </p><p>BETTER SENSES.  INSTEAD OF GOVERNING TO BETTER HIS CITIZENS\' </p><p>MATERIAL LOT, SANI ERRANTLY MIXED POLITICS AND RELIGION.  IF </p><p>LEFT TO BREW, THIS UNFORTUNATE ALCHEMY COULD SPREAD TO OTHER </p><p>PARTS OF NIGERIA.  THAT NEGATIVE DYNAMIC HAD TO BE STOPPED, </p><p>OBASANJO DECLARED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF FURTHER ESTRANGING SANI, OBASANJO </p><p>SAID HE WOULD TRY TO REHABILITATE THE ZAMFARA GOVERNOR.  AS A </p><p>START, HE WAS CONVOKING FOURTEEN EMINENT PERSONS, INCLUDING </p><p>TWO EMIRS, TO ESTABLISH A FACT-FINDING AND RECONCILIATION </p><p>COMMITTEE.  THE COMMITTEE\'S OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE WOULD BE TO </p><p>INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES BEHIND LAST WEEK\'S RUCTIONS BETWEEN </p><p>APP AND PDP ACTIVISTS IN THE STATE.  THE REAL REASON, </p><p>HOWEVER, WAS TO USE THESE RESPECTED PERSONALITIES TO INJECT </p><p>SOME WISDOM INTO SANI\'S CONDUCT THUS MITIGATING HIS </p><p>INCREASINGLY RADICAL RELIGIOUS POPULISM. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  A PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF SANI\'S POLITICAL DISTEMPER WAS </p><p>THE GOVERNOR\'S "MORTAL FEAR" OF NSA ALIYU MOHAMMED, A NATIVE </p><p>OF ZAMFARA AND A CLEAR POLITICAL RIVAL.  OBASANJO RECALLED A </p><p>RECENT BRIEF MEETING WHERE THE GOVERNOR SPUTTERED THE NSA\'S </p><p>NAME "AT LEAST 20 TIMES."  SPECIAL ADVISOR OBE INTERJECTED </p><p>THAT MOHAMMED WAS NOT HELPING MATTERS BECAUSE HE TREATED SANI </p><p>WITH PALPABLE CONTEMPT.  AT THE CORE OF SANI\'S WOES, OBASANJO </p><p>CONFIDED, WAS MALFEASANCE.  TO BOLSTER HIS POPULARITY WITH </p><p>LOCAL CLERICS, SANI HAD DEPLETED THE STATE TREASURY BY GIVING </p><p>FUNDS TO THE ULAMAS.  NOW THAT THE COFFERS WERE BARE, HE HAD </p><p>NO FUNDS FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE, OBASANJO CONTENDED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  AMBASSADOR COMMENTED THAT SANI, SEEMINGLY CLUTCHING </p><p>AT STRAWS, HAD APPROACHED AN EMBASSY OFFICER, ASKING THE </p><p>EMBASSY TO INTERCEDE WITH NSA MOHAMMED ON HIS BEHALF.   A </p><p>BEMUSED OBASANJO QUIPPED THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A "CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>ENGAGEMENT" WITH SANI.  BECOMING MORE SERIOUS, HE ASKED THAT </p><p>WE MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH SANI IN HOPES THAT COMMUNICATION </p><p>WITH THE EMBASSY WOULD HAVE A MODERATING EFFECT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  TURNING FROM ZAMFARA, OBASANJO STATED THAT HE MET </p><p>THE KANO, KADUNA AND KATSINA STATE GOVERNORS OCTOBER 9 TO </p><p>ASSESS THE SECURITY SITUATIONS IN THESE THREE STATES.  KANO, </p><p>WITH ITS TEEMING POPULATION AND LARGE POCKETS OF UNEMPLOYED, </p><p>IS ALWAYS PROBLEMATIC.  PEOPLE IN KANO WANT TO SHOW THEY ARE </p><p>MORE DEVOUT MUSLIMS THAN THEIR BRETHRENS IN SOKOTO, THE </p><p>PRESIDENT COMMENTED.  FORTUNATELY, THE KANO GOVERNOR WAS GOOD </p><p>AND THE EMIR OF KANO WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE TRADITIONAL </p><p>LEADER IN THE NORTH.  THE EMIR WAS A STRONG BULWARK AGAINST </p><p>FANATICISM, OBASANJO MAINTAINED.  AMBASSADOR BROUGHT TO HIS </p><p>ATTENTION A PARTICULARLY INFLAMMATORY STATEMENT REPORTEDLY </p><p>MADE BY THE KANO STATE BRANCH OF THE ULAMA COUNCIL.  OBASANJO </p><p>IMMEDIATELY GOT ON THE PHONE TO CALL THE EMIR, BUT </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS NOT THERE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>MONEY LAUNDERING </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  AFTER COMMENDING NIGERIA\'S DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM COALITION, AMBASSADOR JETER STATED THAT </p><p>TERRORISM\'S ABILITY TO FINANCE ITSELF HAD TO BE STOPPED.  WE </p><p>HAVE TO SHUT THE DOOR ON MONEY LAUNDERING IN THIS REGARD. </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, NIGERIA LACKED ADEQUATE LEGISLATION AND AN </p><p>APPROPRIATE BUREAUCRATIC FRAMEWORK TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE, </p><p>JETER REMARKED.  OBASANJO REPLIED THAT THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>JUSTICE WAS DRAFTING LEGISLATION CREATING A FINANCIAL CRIMES </p><p>COMMISSION THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE MONEY LAUNDERING PROBLEM. </p><p>THE PRESIDENT REQUESTED USG ASSISTANCE IN DRAFTING </p><p>LEGISLATION AND ESTABLISHING A CORRECT INSTITUTIONAL </p><p>FRAMEWORK.  THE AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT WE WOULD SEEK TO HELP </p><p>WHERE POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>MPRI - LET\'S TRY IT ONE MORE TIME </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  JETER STATED THAT THE MPRI CONTRACT TO HELP REFORM </p><p>THE NIGERIAN MILITARY HAD REACHED A CRITICAL JUNCTURE.  BOTH </p><p>SIDES NEEDED TO DECIDE WHETHER THE PROGRAM SHOULD CONTINUE. </p><p>FROM THE U.S. PERSPECTIVE, THE NIGERIAN MILITARY LEADERSHIP </p><p>DID NOT APPEAR FULLY COMMITTED TO THE PROGRAM.  WITHOUT THEIR </p><p>SUPPORT, MPRI COULD DO LITTLE,  HE STRESSED.  CONSEQUENTLY, </p><p>RETIRED GENERALS VUONO AND SAINT, THE SENIOR MPRI EXECUTIVES, </p><p>NEEDED "TO SELL" THEIR PROGRAM TO THE NEW MILITARY LEADERSHIP </p><p>WHEN THE MPRI DUO VISIT NIGERIA LATER THIS WEEK.  IF THEY </p><p>COULD CONVINCE THE SERVICE CHIEFS ABOUT THE PROGRAM\'S </p><p>UTILITY, THEN IT MIGHT BE PRUDENT TO END THE PROGRAM. </p><p>OBASANJO OBSERVED THAT THE SERVICE CHIEFS HAD GRUMBLED TO HIM </p><p>THAT THEY HAD NOT SEEN ANY TANGIBLE BENEFITS FROM MPRI THUS </p><p>FAR.  JETER REMINDED THE PRESIDENT THAT MPRI\'S MANDATE WAS </p><p>INSTITUTIONAL REFORM;  THUS, TANGIBLE ITEMS LIKE EQUIPMENT OR </p><p>EVEN TRAINING WERE NEVER IN THE OFFING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  COMMENT. SUFFERING FROM A COLD, OBASANJO OTHERWISE </p><p>SEEMED AS FIT AND LIVELY AS EVER.  HE WAS WELL BRIEFED ON </p><p>SECURITY AND BELIEVED HE HELD MATTERS WELL IN HAND.  THE </p><p>SUPPORT THAT OBASANJO IS GIVING OUR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS ENCOURAGING.  HIS HINT AT INCREASED </p><p>OIL PRODUCTION, ALBEIT ONLY MODEST, IN THE WAKE OF POSSIBLE </p><p>PERSIAN GULF DISRUPTIONS IS AN IMPORTANT SYMBOLIC GESTURE. </p><p>WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAINTAIN AND FURTHER </p><p>CULTIVATED  OBASANJO\'S AND NIGERIA\'S SUPPORT IN THE GLOBAL </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
