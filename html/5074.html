<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 ANKARA 000286 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INL, EUR/SE </p><p>JUSTICE FOR OIA, AFMLS, AND NDDS </p><p>TREASURY FOR FINCEN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, SNAR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY:  2002 INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL </p><p>STRATEGY REPORT (INSCR) </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 240015 B) STATE 240035 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Following is the draft 2002 INSCR report for Turkey.  Post </p><p>will transmit any changes to addressees per reftels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I.  Summary: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey is a major transit route for Southwest Asian opiates </p><p>moving to Europe, and serves as a base of operations for </p><p>major narcotics traffickers and brokers.  Turkish law </p><p>enforcement organizations continue to focus their efforts on </p><p>stemming the traffic of drugs and intercepting precursor </p><p>chemicals.  Turkish forces cooperate closely with European </p><p>and U.S. agencies to combat trafficking.  While most of the </p><p>heroin trafficked via Turkey is marketed in Western European </p><p>countries, an increasing amount of heroin and opium also is </p><p>smuggled from Turkey to the U.S.  There is no appreciable </p><p>cultivation of illicit narcotics in Turkey other than </p><p>marijuana grown primarily for domestic consumption.  We are </p><p>unaware of any diversion from Turkey\'s licit opium poppy </p><p>cultivation and pharmaceutical morphine production program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey signed the UN Drug Convention in 1988 and formally </p><p>ratified the agreement in 1996.  Turkey is an active member </p><p>of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  The U.S. </p><p>terminated its USD 500,000 annual assistance program with </p><p>Turkey at the end of FY 1999, due to Turkey\'s refusal to </p><p>accept human rights language (related to the Leahy Amendment) </p><p>in the bilateral letter of agreement.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>II.  Status of the Country: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey is a major transshipment and opium conversion point </p><p>for heroin.  Turkey also serves as a base of operations for </p><p>international narcotics traffickers and associates who </p><p>control the smuggling and trafficking of opium, morphine </p><p>base, heroin, precursor chemicals and other drugs.  The </p><p>majority of these opiates originate in Afghanistan, and are </p><p>ultimately shipped to Western Europe.  A smaller but still </p><p>significant amount of heroin is trafficked to the U.S. via </p><p>Turkey, as well as indirectly through Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish law enforcement and anti-narcotics forces are </p><p>strongly committed to disrupting narcotics trafficking. </p><p>Turkish counter-narcotic forces continue to increase the </p><p>sophistication of their operations, including their ability </p><p>to conduct controlled deliveries domestically and </p><p>internationally.  The Turkish National Police remains </p><p>Turkey\'s most sophisticated counter-narcotics force, while </p><p>the Jandarma and Customs continue to increase their efficacy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish authorities continue to seize large amounts of heroin </p><p>and precursor chemicals, such as acetic anhydride.  It is </p><p>estimated that multi-ton amounts of heroin are processed in </p><p>or smuggled through Turkey each month. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey is one of the two traditional opium-growing countries </p><p>as recognized by the U.S. Government and the International </p><p>Narcotics Control Board (INCB).  There is no appreciable </p><p>illicit drug cultivation in Turkey other than marijuana grown </p><p>primarily for domestic consumption.  The Turkish Government </p><p>maintains strict control over its licit poppy program, which </p><p>provides opiates for the international pharmaceutical market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>III.  Country Actions against Drugs: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a) Policy Initiatives:  The Turkish Government devotes </p><p>significant financial and human resources to Turkish law </p><p>enforcement organizations to support counter-narcotics </p><p>activities.  In February 2002, DEA and the Turkish National </p><p>Police hosted the Southwest Asia Heroin Strategy Conference </p><p>in Ankara.  This meeting led to the development of Operation </p><p>Containment, a regional program aimed at reducing the flow of </p><p>Afghan heroin to Western Europe.  The DEA and Turkish </p><p>National Police then hosted a follow-up meeting in Ankara in </p><p>May 2002.  Turkey is playing a key role in Operation </p><p>Containment as well as in other regional efforts, assisting </p><p>with multi-nation controlled deliveries and providing </p><p>significant logistical support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In 2002, the government dissolved the Drug Monitoring and </p><p>Guidance Board and transferred its responsibilities to the </p><p>Turkish International Academy against Drugs and Organized </p><p>Crime (TADOC).  TADOC did not announce any new policy </p><p>initiatives in this area in 2002. </p><p>(b) Accomplishments:  The Turkish International Academy </p><p>against Drugs and Organized Crime (TADOC), which was </p><p>established under the initiative of the UN and the Turkish </p><p>National Police in 2000, trained 1,563 participants in 2002, </p><p>196 of them being international law enforcement officers. </p><p>International participants were from countries of the </p><p>Economic Cooperation Organization, Black Sea Economic </p><p>Cooperation and the Balkans.  The training program led to </p><p>enhanced cooperation and information sharing in law </p><p>enforcement among the participant countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Financial Crimes Investigation Board (FCIB/MASAK) issued </p><p>two communiques in 2002.  The first communique, dated Feb </p><p>2002, requires banks and financial institutions to report </p><p>suspicious transactions, pursuant to the recommendation of </p><p>the Financial Action Task Force.  This communique is an </p><p>important step for pursuing both money laundering and </p><p>terrorist financing cases.  The second communique calls on </p><p>banks and private financial institutions to appoint a liaison </p><p>officer as a point of contact for FCIB in order to better </p><p>track suspicious financial transactions.  The FCIB also </p><p>completed the "Financial Intelligence Database Project" in </p><p>2002, a database that is expected to increase FCIB\'s </p><p>efficiency. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(c) Law Enforcement Efforts:  During 2002, Turkish law </p><p>enforcement agencies, including the Turkish National Police, </p><p>the Jandarma, Customs and the Coast Guard, conducted </p><p>successful operations and seized over xx tons of heroin, xx </p><p>tons of hashish, and xx million pills (figures to be updated </p><p>1/31/03). In March 2002, Turkish authorities seized 7,454 </p><p>kilos of morphine base as a result of a DEA-Jandarma joint </p><p>investigation.  This was the largest seizure of morphine base </p><p>ever in Turkey.  Authorities made xx drug-related arrests in </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(d) Corruption:  The Anti-Corruption Supervisory Committee, </p><p>which was established in 2001, submitted an "Action Plan on </p><p>Increased Transparency and Efficient Administration in </p><p>Turkey" to the Council of Ministers in 2001.  The Council of </p><p>Ministers approved the action plan in January 2002 and </p><p>established a monitoring commission comprised of the related </p><p>ministers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The new government, which was elected in November 2002, </p><p>committed in its "action plan" to secure parliamentary </p><p>approval of the European Council\'s Criminal Law on Corruption </p><p>and the Civil Law on Corruption, and to participate in the </p><p>Group of Countries Against Corruption (GRECO). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(e) Agreements and Treaties:  Turkey ratified the 1988 UN </p><p>Drug Convention in 1996 and has been a member of the </p><p>Financial Action Task Force since 1991.  The government </p><p>signed the UN Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist </p><p>Financing in Sep 2001, and the Turkish parliament ratified </p><p>the convention in April 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(f) Cultivation/Production:  Illicit drug cultivation, </p><p>primarily marijuana, is minor and has no impact on the United </p><p>States.  Licit opium poppy cultivation is strictly controlled </p><p>by the Turkish Grain Board (TMO), with no apparent diversion </p><p>into illicit channels.  Farmers receive a higher return from </p><p>the sale of poppy seeds as a food product than the sale of </p><p>the low alkaloid poppy straw. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(g) Drug Flow/Transit:  Turkey remains a major route, as well </p><p>as a storage, production and staging area, for the flow of </p><p>heroin to Europe.  Turkish-based traffickers and brokers </p><p>operate directly and in conjunction with narcotic smugglers, </p><p>laboratory operators, and money launderers in and outside </p><p>Turkey.  They finance and control the smuggling of opiates </p><p>(whether in the form of opium, morphine base or heroin) to </p><p>and from Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Afghanistan is the original source of most of the opiates </p><p>reaching Turkey.  Morphine and heroin base are smuggled by </p><p>overland vehicles from Pakistan via Iran to Turkey. </p><p>Multi-ton quantities of opiates and hashish have been </p><p>smuggled by sea from Pakistan to points in Turkey along the </p><p>Mediterranean, Aegean, and/or Marmara seas.  Opiates and </p><p>hashish also are smuggled to Turkey overland from Afghanistan </p><p>via Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. </p><p>Traffickers in Turkey illegally acquire the precursor </p><p>chemical acetic anhydride, which is used in the production of </p><p>heroin, from sources in Western Europe, the Balkans and </p><p>Russia.  From July 1, 1999, to December 31, 2002, over 94 </p><p>metric tons of acetic anhydride was seized in or destined for </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish-based traffickers control and operate the illicit </p><p>laboratories refining morphine base into heroin at various </p><p>locations in Turkey.  Some of them reportedly have interests </p><p>in heroin laboratories operating near the Iranian-Turkish </p><p>border in Iran.  The ready availability of opiates </p><p>originating from Afghanistan and precursor chemicals from </p><p>other countries enables major traffickers in Turkey to </p><p>continue to operate illicit laboratories converting morphine </p><p>base into heroin.  These heroin laboratories enable </p><p>Turkish-based traffickers to control much of the heroin </p><p>marketed to Western Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(h) Demand Reduction:  While drug abuse remains low in Turkey </p><p>compared to other countries, the number of addicts reportedly </p><p>has increased in recent years.  Although the Turkish </p><p>Government appears to be increasingly aware of the need to </p><p>combat drug abuse, the agencies responsible for drug </p><p>awareness and treatment remain under-funded.  There are a </p><p>total of five Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment Clinics </p><p>(AMATEM) in Turkey, which serve as regional drug treatment </p><p>centers.  Due to lack of funds, only one of the centers </p><p>focuses on drug prevention as well as treatment.  The Health </p><p>Ministry has not conducted a drug abuse survey since 1995 due </p><p>to lack of resources. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IV.  U.S. Policies, Initiatives and Programs: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a) U.S. Policy Initiatives and Programs:  U.S. policy </p><p>remains to strengthen Turkey,s ability to combat narcotics </p><p>trafficking, money laundering and financial crimes.  Through </p><p>fiscal year 1999, the U.S. Government extended USD 500,000 </p><p>annually in assistance to provide:  commodity and training </p><p>assistance to the Turkish National Police and Jandarma; </p><p>training and equipment to Turkish Customs to improve border </p><p>interdiction; commodity and training to the Turkish Grain </p><p>Board and training to the Turkish Financial Crimes </p><p>Investigation Board. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(b) Bilateral Cooperation:  U.S. counter-narcotics agencies </p><p>report that their counterparts have continued excellent </p><p>cooperation with U.S. officials.  Turkish counter-narcotics </p><p>forces have developed technically, becoming increasingly </p><p>professional, in part based on the training and equipment </p><p>they received from the U.S. and other international law </p><p>enforcement agencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On February 7, 2002, DEA presented the Turkish National </p><p>Police and the Turkish Government with an asset sharing check </p><p>for USD 264,846.  This money was part of more than USD 2 </p><p>million seized by DEA in the course of a long-term, </p><p>multinational criminal investigation that culminated in 1995 </p><p>with coordinated arrests in the U.S., Turkey, Holland, and </p><p>Germany.  Turkish government cooperation was key to this </p><p>case; the Turkish National Police contributed critical </p><p>evidence without which many convictions would not have been </p><p>possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(c) Road Ahead:  With the election of a new government in </p><p>November 2002, many of the key government officials </p><p>responsible for counter-narcotics and money-laundering may be </p><p>replaced.  The U.S. Mission in Turkey intends to engage these </p><p>officials, and work with the new government to help combat </p><p>drug trafficking, money laundering, and corruption.  Should </p><p>the economic recession in Turkey continue, financial </p><p>resources available to law enforcement agencies may be </p><p>limited. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>V.

Money Laundering: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(a) General:  Turkey is not an offshore financial center and </p><p>does not have secrecy laws that prevent disclosure of client </p><p>and ownership information to bank supervisors and law </p><p>enforcement officials.  Turkey is an important regional </p><p>financial center, particularly for Central Asia and the </p><p>Caucasus, as well as for the Middle East and Eastern Europe. </p><p>Since the financial crisis of 2000, the Turkish Government </p><p>has taken over 19 of Turkey,s 81 banks, and has </p><p>significantly tightened oversight of the banking system </p><p>through an independent regulatory authority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The government has increased its focus on money laundering, </p><p>but has had difficulty obtaining convictions.  Since being </p><p>established in 1997, the Financial Crimes Investigative Board </p><p>(FCIB) has pursued more than 500 money laundering cases.  Of </p><p>those, 59 cases have been prosecuted, with only one case </p><p>resulting in a conviction.  Most of the cases involve </p><p>non-narcotic criminal actions or tax evasion; roughly 30 </p><p>percent are narcotics related. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It is believed that Turkish-based traffickers collect and </p><p>transfer money to pay narcotic suppliers in Pakistan and </p><p>Afghanistan, primarily by using money exchanges in Istanbul. </p><p>The exchanges in turn wire transfer the funds through Turkish </p><p>banks to accounts in Dubai and other locations in the United </p><p>Arab Emirates.  The money is then paid, often through the </p><p>underground banking system, to narcotics suppliers in </p><p>Pakistan and Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish Government broadened the definition of money </p><p>laundering in 2001, through adopting three conventions of the </p><p>Council of Europe:  the Strasbourg Convention on Laundering, </p><p>Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime; </p><p>the Criminal Law on Corruption; and the Civil Law on </p><p>Corruption.  By becoming a party to these conventions, the </p><p>Turkish Government agreed to include proceeds of all serious </p><p>crimes in the definition of money laundering, and to specify </p><p>corruption as a predicate offense for money laundering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish Government signed the UN Convention against </p><p>Transnational Organized Crime in 2001 and has submitted a </p><p>draft proposal to the UN to become a party to the UN </p><p>Convention against Corruption.  Turkey signed the Convention </p><p>on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in </p><p>International Business Transactions in 2000. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey cooperates closely with the U.S. and its neighbors to </p><p>support the development of a regional anti-crime center in </p><p>the Balkans under the Southeast Europe Cooperation Initiative </p><p>(SECI).  Turkey and the U.S. have a MLAT and cooperate </p><p>closely on narcotics investigations and proceedings.  Turkey </p><p>and the U.S. have worked closely on money laundering related </p><p>investigations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There is no significant black market in Turkey, but tax </p><p>evasion is a problem for the Turkish economy.  The GOT began </p><p>a joint study with the IRC in 2001 to improve its tax </p><p>collection.  Turkey has established systems for identifying, </p><p>tracing, freezing, seizing and forfeiting narcotics-related </p><p>assets.  Turkey,s laws allow for only criminal forfeiture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
