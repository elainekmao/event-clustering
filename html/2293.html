<p>S E C R E T ABUJA 003193 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF, AF/W, AF/RA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/13/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MARR, MOPS, BE, BY, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEMARCHE ON BURUNDI DEPLOYMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 210600 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 3039 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Post will raise points (Ref A) with the GON at the </p><p>earliest appropriate opportunity.  However, Minister of State </p><p>for Defense (Army) Lawal Batagarawa will be in Washington </p><p>this week for meetings on the Hill and with the Department. </p><p>Batagarawa, who attended preparatory meetings in Arusha and </p><p>Pretoria, has been in charge of planning for the deployment. </p><p>Batagarawa\'s presence in Washington provides an excellent </p><p>opportunity for the Department to seek his perspective on the </p><p>deployment, and to convey our understanding of the situation </p><p>in Burundi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) While we should raise concern, we believe that it </p><p>would be counter-productive to press the Nigerian Government </p><p>not to deploy to Burundi.  We should not be seen as speaking </p><p>for Burundi, or South Africa, for that matter.  In our view, </p><p>the best tack to pursue would be for us to convey to </p><p>Batagarawa an understanding that the South African contingent </p><p>is currently under-employed and ask Batagarawa if Abuja has </p><p>been in contact with Bujumbura about the deployment\'s timing. </p><p> Additionally, if Bujumbura does not want the Nigerian </p><p>deployment at this time, it would seem more appropriate that </p><p>the GOB directly communicate this preference to Pretoria and </p><p>Abuja.  If we are the only ones carrying this message to the </p><p>Nigerians, we will be seen as interlopers, and uninvited </p><p>intruders, at that. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Finally, Department should be prepared for Batagarawa </p><p>to raise his idea for a PKO deployment for debt swap </p><p>arrangement (Ref B). </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
