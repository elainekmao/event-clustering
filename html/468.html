CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  IN A REMARKABLE MONOLOGUE WHICH </p><p>REFLECTED MORE ABOUT THE CURRENT TORTURED THINKING OF </p><p>COMMUNIST APPARATCHIKS THAN REALITY, 0. L. ZOLOTAREV, </p><p>AIDE TO LENINGRAD COMMUNIST PARTY FIRST SECRETARY </p><p>GIDASPOV, ASSERTED AUGUST 28 THAT: </p><p> </p><p>- GIDASPOV HAD NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN THE AUGUST 19-21 </p><p>COUP, THOUGH HE HAD SERVED ON LENINGRAD\'S </p><p>"EXTRAORDINARY COMMITTEE;" </p><p> </p><p>- GIDASPOV HAD NOT KNOWN WHO HAD FORMED THE COMMITTEE </p><p>OR WHY HE WAS INVITED TO SERVE; </p><p> </p><p>- THE COMMUNIST PARTY WOULD RISE INEVITABLY AGAIN, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE "DIALECTIC;" </p><p> </p><p>- THE CURRENT "TIME OF TROUBLES" COULD ONLY END WITH </p><p>A CRACKDOWN OR "IRON FIST" WITHIN FIVE YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>ZOLOTAREV ALSO STATED THAT GIDASPOV WOULD VOLUNTARILY </p><p>COOPERATE WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE LENINGRAD </p><p>PROCURATOR\'S OFFICE INTO HIS ACTIVITIES DURING THE </p><p>COUP, DESPITE THE "ILLEGAL" SEIZURE OF COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY HEADQUARTERS BY THE CITY GOVERNMENT.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  LENINGRAD CONOFFS HAD AN IMPROMPTU MEETING AUGUST </p><p>28 WITH OLEG LEONARDOVICH ZOLOTAREV, AIDE TO FIRST </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE LENINGRAD OBKOM OF THE CPSU, BORIS </p><p>VENIAMINOVICH GIDASPOV.  ALONG WITH OTHER LENINGRAD </p><p>DIPLOMATS, CONOFFS HAD BEEN CALLED TO A "PRESS </p><p>CONFERENCE" WITH GIDASPOV; THE FIRST SECRETARY FAILED </p><p>TO APPEAR FOR THE MEETING BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN ASKED </p><p>TO SUBMIT TO A "VOLUNTARY" INTERROGATION BY THE </p><p>LENINGRAD PROCURATOR\'S OFFICE REGARDING HIS ROLE IN </p><p>THE AUGUST 19-21 COUP ATTEMPT.  INSTEAD, GIDASPOV\'S </p><p>ASSISTANT, ZOLOTAREV, GAVE AN OFF-THE-CUFF BRIEFING </p><p>ON THE LENINGRAD COMMUNIST PARTY\'S CURRENT TRAVAILS </p><p>-- AND OUTLOOK ON THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>SEIZURE OF SMOLNIY ILLEGAL? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  ZOLOTAREV BEGAN BY EXPLAINING THAT FIRST </p><p>SECRETARY GIDASPOV HAD GONE TO THE LENINGRAD </p><p>PROCURATOR\'S OFFICE TUESDAY, AUGUST 27, TO LODGE A </p><p>FORMAL COMPLAINT ABOUT THE "ILLEGAL" SEIZURE OF THE </p><p>SMOLNIY INSTITUTE, LENINGRAD\'S COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>HEADQUARTERS.  WHEN SMOLNIY HAD BEEN SEALED SATURDAY, </p><p>AUGUST 24, ZOLOTAREV COMPLAINED, THE MVD HAD NOT </p><p>SHOWN ANY PAPERS.  NOR HAD THERE BEEN A </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PROCURATOR\'S OFFICE PRESENT. </p><p>THE MILITIA HAD CLAIMED THEY WERE ACTING ON A DECREE </p><p>FROM YEL\'TSIN (COMMENT: PRESUMABLY YEL\'TSIN\'S DECREE </p><p>OUTLAWING THE COMMUNIST PARTY), ZOLOTAREV EXPLAINED, </p><p>BUT THEY DID NOT SHOW A COPY OF THE DECREE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  RETREATING SOMEWHAT, ZOLOTAREV ADMITTED THAT THE </p><p>CITY GOVERNMENT PROBABLY ENJOYED THE RIGHT TO </p><p>REOCCUPY THE SMOLNIY INSTITUTE AS IT WAS "CITY </p><p>PROPERTY" WHICH THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAD BEEN </p><p>RENTING.  "ANY LANDLORD CAN BREAK A LEASE," HE </p><p>EXPLAINED.  YET THIS RIGHT TO BREAK A LEASE, </p><p>ZOLOTAREV INSISTED, SHOULD BE EXERCISED ACCORDING TO </p><p>DUE PROCESS -- NOT BY UNILATERAL ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>GIDASPOV STILL IMMUNE? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  APOLOGIZING FOR GIDASPOV\'S INABILITY TO RECEIVE </p><p>THE DIPLOMATS, ZOLOTAREV EXPLAINED THAT A </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE PROCURATOR\'S OFFICE HAD </p><p>APPEARED UNEXPECTEDLY THAT MORNING AND REQUESTED TO </p><p>MEET WITH GIDASPOV.  THOUGH GIDASPOV STILL ENJOYED </p><p>IMMUNITY BY VIRTUE OF HIS STATUS AS A DEPUTY TO THE </p><p>USSR CONGRESS OF PEOPLE\'S DEPUTIES, ZOLOTAREV </p><p>EXPLAINED, GIDASPOV HAD VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO GIVE AN </p><p>"EXPLANATION" OF HIS ROLE IN THE AUGUST 19-21 COUP TO </p><p>THE PROCURATOR\'S OFFICE.  (COMMENT: POST NOTES THAT </p><p>SEVERAL OTHER SUSPECTED COUP PLOTTERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>RELIEVED OF THEIR IMMUNITY AFTER THEY REFUSED TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH SIMILAR INVESTIGATIONS; GIDASPOV </p><p>CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IF HE REFUSED TO </p><p>COOPERATE, HE WOULD SHORTLY HAVE BEEN STRIPPED OF HIS </p><p>IMMUNITY.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>GIDASPOV INNOCENT BYSTANDER </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  GIDASPOV, ZOLOTAREV CLAIMED, HAD KNOWN NOTHING OF </p><p>THE COUP BEFORE IT TOOK PLACE.  FURTHERMORE, HE HAD </p><p>NEVER ACTUALLY SUPPORTED IT; RATHER, HE HAD BEEN </p><p>CAUGHT UP IN EVENTS AND BEEN UNABLE TO EXTRICATE </p><p>HIMSELF FROM GUILT BY ASSOCIATION.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>ZOLOTAREV, GIDASPOV HAD AWOKEN AT 7:00 A.M. ON </p><p>MONDAY, AUGUST 19, AND HEARD ON THE RADIO NEWS OF THE </p><p>COUP.  GIDASPOV HAD IMMEDIATELY GONE TO HIS OFFICE </p><p>AND SPOKEN WITH COLONAL-GENERAL SAMSONOV, HEAD OF THE </p><p>LENINGRAD MILITARY DISTRICT, WHO HAD BEEN NAMED AS </p><p>HEAD OF LENINGRAD\'S PUTATIVE "EXTRAORDINARY </p><p>COMMITTEE."  DURING THE CONVERSATION, GIDASPOV HAD </p><p>LEARNED THAT HE, TOO, WAS A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>"EXTRAORDINARY COMMITTEE" FOR LENINGRAD.  GIDASPOV </p><p>SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE, ZOLOTAREV UNEQUIVOCALLY </p><p>ASSERTED, IN HIS CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF LENINGRAD\'S </p><p>MILITARY COMMITTEE AND NOT IN HIS CAPACITY AS FIRST </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE OBLAST CPSU.  GIDASPOV HAD ATTENDED </p><p>TWO MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE ON AUGUST 19, INCLUDING </p><p>ONE IN WHICH MAYOR SOBCHAK HAD ADDRESSED THE </p><p>COMMITTEE.  ZOLOTAREV BALDLY STATED THAT GIDASPOV HAD </p><p>AT NO TIME SUCCEEDED IN DETERMINING EITHER WHO HAD </p><p>CREATED THE COMMITTEE, WHO HAD NAMED ITS MEMBERS OR </p><p>WHY HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN NAMED A MEMBER.  (COMMENT: </p><p>ZOLOTAREV NEVER EXPLAINED WHY, IF GIDASPOV HAD NOT </p><p>SUPPORTED THE COUP AS CLAIMED, HE HAD NOT REFUSED TO </p><p>SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  ZOLOTAREV REPORTED THAT GIDASPOV SPENT THE NEXT </p><p>DAY OF THE COUP, AUGUST 20, "PREPARING FOR THE </p><p>UPCOMING PARTY PLENUM, AT WHICH HE WAS SCHEDULED TO </p><p>GIVE AN IMPORTANT REPORT."  GIDASPOV, ZOLOTAREV </p><p>ASSURED CONOFFS, HAD NEVER GONE TO MOSCOW (COMMENT: </p><p>AS WAS WIDELY REPORTED IN THE SOVIET PRESS) BUT HAD </p><p>REMAINED IN LENINGRAD.  THE REPORTS OF GIDASPOV\'S </p><p>PHANTOM MOSCOW TRIP WERE "DISINFORMATION," ZOLOTAREV </p><p>CLAIMED, AIMED AT "DISCREDITING" THE FIRST SECRETARY. </p><p> </p><p>LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTY NEWSPAPER DEFECTS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  ZOLOTAREV REPORTED MATTER-OF-FACTLY THAT THE </p><p>"WORKING COLLECTIVE" OF LENINGRAD PRAVDA, THE PARTY\'S </p><p>PRIMARY NEWSPAPER IN THE CITY, HAD DETERMINED TO </p><p>BECOME INDEPENDENT AND RENAME THE PAPER TO "SANKT </p><p>PETERBURGSKIYE VEDOMOSTI".   THE LOCAL PARTY HAD NOT </p><p>BEEN INVOLVED IN THE DECISION, ZOLOTAREV SAID, AND </p><p>HAD "NO COMMENT" ON THE PAPER\'S CHANGE OF STATUS. </p><p>HENCEFORTH, HE EXPLAINED, THE PARTY WOULD HAVE TO </p><p>RELY ON ITS NEWSWEEKLY "RABOCHIY LENINGRAD" TO GET </p><p>ITS VIEWS ACROSS TO THE PUBLIC.  (COMMENT: ACCORDING </p><p>TO CONSULATE\'S PRESS CONTACTS, THE ENTIRE WORKERS\' </p><p>COLLECTIVE OF THE PAPER WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FIRED AND </p><p>THE PAPER IS NOW BEING RUN BY THE LENINGRAD CITY </p><p>COUNCIL.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>PARTY UNREPENTANT, BUT CONFUSED </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  ZOLOTAREV THEN LAUNCHED INTO A RAMBLING, </p><p>SOMEWHAT CONFUSED DISCOURSE ON THE CURRENT POSITION </p><p>AND LIKELY FUTURE OF THE PARTY, DURING WHICH HE: </p><p> </p><p>- COMPARED THE CURRENT STATE OF THE SOVIET UNION TO </p><p>THE "TIME OF TROUBLES" (SMUTNOE VREMYA) DURING THE </p><p>REIGN OF BORIS GODUNOV.  THAT PERIOD OF CHAOS, </p><p>ZOLOTAREV CONFIDENTLY ASSURED CONOFFS, HAD ENDED WITH </p><p>AN "IRON FIST," AS WOULD THE CURRENT PERIOD OF CHAOS </p><p>INEVITABLY END WITH A CRACKDOWN "WITHIN FIVE YEARS." </p><p>INDEED, ZOLOTAREV REMARKED, THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO PERIODS WERE UNCANNY: "IN THE TIME OF </p><p>TROUBLES, THE RUSSIAN CHURCH HAD BEEN PERSECUTED AND </p><p>ROBBED.  SO TOO, TODAY, THE PARTY -- WHICH IS, IN A </p><p>SENSE, A CHURCH IN THAT IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>IDEOLOGY -- IS BEING PERSECUTED AND ROBBED OF ITS </p><p>PROPERTY;" </p><p> </p><p>- CLAIMED THAT, WHILE THE MEMBERSHIP OF LENINGRAD\'S </p><p>PARTY HAD FALLEN FROM 460,000 A YEAR AGO TO 300,000 </p><p>CURRENTLY, THE FALL WAS ONLY TEMPORARY.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>"THE DIALECTIC," THE PARTY WOULD INEVITABLY RISE </p><p>AGAIN.  IT WAS ONLY "A MATTER OF TIME." </p><p> </p><p>- ACCUSED SHEVARDNADZE, YAKOVLEV AND GORBACHEV OF </p><p>BECOMING THE "LIQUIDATORS" OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY. </p><p>THEY HAD LIQUIDATED THE PARTY IN THE PAST FEW YEARS </p><p>BY STIFLING "ALL INTIATIVE."  INDEED, THOUGH THERE </p><p>WERE OVER 100 SUPREME SOVIET DEPUTIES FROM THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY, THEY HAD BEEN "HELD BACK" BY THE </p><p>LIQUIDATORS.  AS A RESULT, THE COMMUNIST DEPUTIES HAD </p><p>NOT INTIATED "A SINGLE DECREE OR NEW LAW" DURING THE </p><p>PAST YEAR; </p><p> </p><p>- PREDICTED THAT THE LENINGRAD CITY COUNCIL WOULD </p><p>PROVE ITSELF USELESS AT ADMINISTERING THE CITY. </p><p>"NORMALLY," ZOLOTAREV CLAIMED, THE CITY COUNCIL HELD </p><p>A SPECIAL MEETING EVERY AUGUST 15 TO DISCUSS </p><p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE COMING WINTER.  THIS HAD NOT </p><p>HAPPENED THIS YEAR AND IT REFLECTED THE CURRENT CITY </p><p>LEADERSHIP\'S POOR ORGANIZATION; </p><p> </p><p>- COMPLAINED THAT THE ENTIRE LENINGRAD PARTY </p><p>ORGANIZATION DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE TELEPHONE.  THE </p><p>PARTY HAD BEEN LOCKED OUT OF THEIR OFFICES AND THEIR </p><p>OTHER PHONE LINES HAD BEEN CUT, ZOLOTAREV ADMITTED </p><p>RUEFULLY.  WE ARE LIVING, HE SAID, "UNDER THREAT" </p><p>(POD UGROZOI). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: YOU CAN\'T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>11.  APART FROM HIS WARNING ABOUT CITY PREPARATIONS </p><p>FOR THE WINTER, ZOLOTAREV\'S COMMENTS READ LIKE A PAGE </p><p>OUT OF THE THEATER OF THE ABSURD.  ONE CANNOT BUT </p><p>SAVOR HIS CLAIMS THAT GIDASPOV HAD NO IDEA HOW HE </p><p>CAME TO SERVE ON LENINGRAD\'S "EXTRAORDINARY </p><p>COMMITTEE."   NOR ARE ZOLOTAREV\'S BOAST THAT THE </p><p>PARTY WOULD "RISE AGAIN" ACCORDING TO THE "DIALECTIC" </p><p>OR HIS COMPARISON OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY TO ITS </p><p>ERSTWHILE ENEMY AND VICTIM, THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCH, ANY LESS AMUSING FOR THEIR HISTORICAL </p><p>IRONY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  BUT THE INTERVIEW HAS A MORE SERIOUS SIDE. </p><p>ZOLOTAREV\'S COMMENTS REFLECT THE INTELLECTUAL </p><p>STERILITY AND STUBBORN REFUSAL TO ABANDON DISCREDITED </p><p>IDEAS THAT CONTINUES TO CHARACTERIZE THE HIGHEST </p><p>LEVELS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY.  IT SEEMS THAT </p><p>LENINGRAD\'S COMMUNIST PARTY REMAINS UNREPENTANT AND </p><p>EVER-READY TO LIE, CHEAT AND SOW CONFUSION -- EVEN AS </p><p>IT SLIDES INTO THE GRAVE. </p><p> </p><p>GOSNELL </p><p></p></div>
