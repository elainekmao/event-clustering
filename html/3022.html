<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001037 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: KOIRALA CAMP CLAIMS CONSPIRACY IN DISSOLUTION OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1008 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Supporters of Nepali Congress Party President and </p><p>former Prime Minister G.P. Koirala are, predictably enough, </p><p>branding Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s unexpected </p><p>decision to dissolve Parliament (Reftels) a threat to </p><p>democracy.  The Koirala camp obviously miscalculated the PM\'s </p><p>likely response to the President\'s challenge and is now </p><p>scrambling for recovery.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>THE SPIN FROM THE KOIRALA CAMP </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Supporters of Nepali Congress Party President and </p><p>former Prime Minister G.P. Koirala are branding Prime </p><p>Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s move to dissolve Parliament and </p><p>call new elections (Reftels) a threat to democracy, and are </p><p>hinting darkly at behind-the-scenes Palace manipulation of </p><p>events.  The Koirala camp, which obviously miscalculated </p><p>Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s probable response to </p><p>Koirala\'s challenge to his authority, are now scrambling to </p><p>give the imbroglio an appropriate spin.  Koirala himself told </p><p>the Australian Ambassador May 24 that Deuba\'s move can only </p><p>be interpreted as a "conspiracy," and charged that the PM is </p><p>a "stooge" of the Army and the Palace.  Koirala claimed that </p><p>Deuba has been threatening the Nepali Congress MPs, saying </p><p>that he will form his own party, Koirala continued.  He asked </p><p>the Ambassador to warn his diplomatic colleagues that Deuba </p><p>will try to steal the elections, if they are held. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Former Foreign Minister and Party Central Working </p><p>Committee (CWC) Member Chakra Prasad Bastola sounded similar </p><p>themes, if on a somewhat softer note.  The split between </p><p>Deuba and Koirala was really only a trivial, technical matter </p><p>within the party, Bastola said, and should never have been </p><p>allowed to progress to the current state of rupture.  All the </p><p>Nepali Congress MPs were completely "taken aback" by Deuba\'s </p><p>decision to dissolve Parliament.  (Party General Secretary </p><p>Sushil Koirala told us the same thing, describing the </p><p>membership as "utterly shocked.")  Security in the country </p><p>has deteriorated to such a level that elections cannot be </p><p>held within six months, Bastola predicted.  Since there is no </p><p>constitutional provision for such a contingency, "Deuba has </p><p>facilitated direct action by the King" to fill the void. </p><p>(Note:  According to Bastola\'s interpretation, the King could </p><p>take such action under Clause 127 of the Constitution, which </p><p>authorizes him to "issue necessary orders" to resolve "any </p><p>difficulty" that might arise "in connection with the </p><p>implementation of this Constitution."  End note.)  When asked </p><p>what the King might possibly gain from such a move, Bastola </p><p>said he has wondered that himself and used to scoff at </p><p>others\' dark hints about the Palace. Now, he said, he fears </p><p>the conspiracy theorists may turn out to be right. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>SPEAKER:  SORROWED BY SPLIT </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Speaker of the House Taranath Ranabhat sounded a </p><p>sadder, less combative note.  Clearly troubled by the </p><p>"serious conflict" within the Nepali Congress, he retains </p><p>some hope that party patriarch K.P. Bhattarai will be able to </p><p>heal the rift.  None of the party\'s founding </p><p>fathers--including Koirala--should want it to be split.  The </p><p>confrontation arose because of mistakes on both sides, he </p><p>charged.  Their actions are "just not helpful to the </p><p>(democratic) system, the people, or the integrity of the </p><p>nation."  Because of the irresponsibility of both leaders, </p><p>the nation may face a constitutional crisis if elections are </p><p>not held in six months.  Their actions were motivated solely </p><p>by personal interests, he charged, inappropriate at any time </p><p>but particularly at such a time of crisis.   If Deuba had </p><p>faced a vote of no confidence and lost, it would have been "a </p><p>negative message for just one person."  Instead, by </p><p>dissolving Parliament and calling elections that may never be </p><p>held, Ranabhat said, the PM had done something "negative for </p><p>the whole country."  But he reserved his harshest criticism </p><p>for Koirala, holding him responsible for introducing "every </p><p>bad thing" into the corrupted political culture.  The folly </p><p>and selfishness of these leaders could obviate all the past </p><p>sacrifices of freedom fighters like himself--and, ironically, </p><p>Koirala and Deuba themselves.  "What nonsense,"  he lamented, </p><p>wiping away tears. </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  After their first miscalculations, the Koirala </p><p>faction is obviously spinning as fast as it can to show that </p><p>Deuba\'s call for elections--entirely within Constitutional </p><p>guidelines--is only a step in some nefarious, ill-defined </p><p>plot.  The comments of the Speaker, on the other hand, seemed </p><p>refreshingly free of spin and an eloquent, if pained, </p><p>analysis of the political culture.  The language in the </p><p>Constitutional clause cited by Bastola is so vague as to </p><p>have, in our view, no more particular relevance to the </p><p>current situation than to any other.  As reported reftel, the </p><p>King continues to reiterate to us his support for the </p><p>Constitution and the democratic system.  We have seen no </p><p>signs to the contrary. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
