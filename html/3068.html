<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001358 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS EFFECTIVE; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "Government in a state of denial of </p><p>    reality" the independent daily "The Daily News" </p><p>    dedicated its Tuesday 4 editorial to declaring that the </p><p>    travel restrictions imposed on Mugabe\'s government are </p><p>    effective.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   "The government\'s attempts to pretend that the </p><p>    whole world still loves it in spite of its violation of </p><p>    its citizens\' human rights are now bordering on the </p><p>    absurd.  Last month, President Mugabe led a high- </p><p>    powered delegation to New York to attend a United </p><p>    Nations conference on children.  Under the UN </p><p>    headquarters agreement the U.S. is obliged to let any </p><p>    head of state into the UN building unless they are </p><p>    banned or suspended from the UN.  That is the only </p><p>    reason why Mugabe and his retinue were able to travel </p><p>    to the US, in spite of the \'smart sanctions\' imposed on </p><p>    them by the US administration under the Zimbabwe </p><p>    Democracy and Economic Recovery Act.  If they had </p><p>    landed in Washington, DC or Seattle, in Washington </p><p>    State, on a shopping spree, it is doubtful that they </p><p>    would have been allowed to get off their plane.  But </p><p>    the government propaganda would have us believe that </p><p>    the government is winning its war against its </p><p>    detractors, that the sanctions are ineffective and that </p><p>    Zimbabwe is as squeaky clean, diplomatically, as it was </p><p>    before the bloodshed that began with the farm invasions </p><p>    of 2000 and culminated with the controversial </p><p>    presidential election last March.  All this </p><p>    misinformation may fool some people some of the time, </p><p>    but it won\'t fool all the people all the time. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
