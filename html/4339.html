<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008310 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AK PARTY MOVES STEP BY STEP TOWARD FORMING </p><p>GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8252 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) We understand from top AK Party official Bulent Arinc </p><p>that in his Nov. 15 call on President Sezer, AK Party </p><p>chairman Erdogan submitted AK number two Abdullah Gul\'s name </p><p>as AK\'s first choice for Prime Minister.  Arinc intimated </p><p>that Gul is AK\'s preferred candidate not only owing to his </p><p>popularity within the party\'s grassroots and experience both </p><p>in Parliament and foreign affairs, but also to maintain the </p><p>delicate balances among Erdogan\'s ambitious group of senior </p><p>advisors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) However, AK has seen that Sezer prefers to choose </p><p>candidates for senior positions not according to political </p><p>criteria but from among a narrow circle of statist </p><p>acquaintances from his university class.  In this regard, </p><p>Arinc noted Sezer\'s rectitude but said that Sezer, an </p><p>arch-statist, does not understand the political scene and in </p><p>fact deprecates the nature and role of politics (we have </p><p>heard the same from others).  Therefore, Erdogan offered the </p><p>name of former senior bureaucrat Vecdi Gonul, whom Sezer had </p><p>worked with previously and who is from Sezer\'s generation, as </p><p>an alternative.  Arinc opined that, if Sezer gives out the </p><p>mandate to form the government by Nov. 17, AK could have a </p><p>government in place by late Nov. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Arinc admitted obliquely that he had had hopes of </p><p>being tapped as Prime Minister but, laughing, said he had </p><p>withdrawn his name from consideration because he knew the </p><p>Deep State (ref) had even more compromising video tapes of </p><p>him in a (previously) radical Islamist mode than of Erdogan. </p><p>Saying he hopes to be elected Speaker of Parliament Nov. 19 </p><p>or 20, Arinc was caught off guard when we noted that just </p><p>before our meeting a leading TV news channel reported Sezer </p><p>wants to influence Parliament\'s choice of speaker.  Arinc </p><p>remarked uneasily that Sezer has no constitutional authority </p><p>over Parliament\'s decision. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
