<p>S E C R E T ROME 003386 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, PGOV, ETTC, IT, LY, IR, EXPORT CONTROLS </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN FAST BOAT EXPORTS TO IRAN, LIBYA </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 209602 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p> B AND D </p><p> </p><p> 1. (S) DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR POLITICAL-MILITARY </p><p>AFFAIRS ROBERT MAGGI, TOGETHER WITH ECMIN AND ECONOFF, RAISED </p><p>CONTINUING U.S. CONCERNS REGARDING ITALIAN EXPORTS TO IRAN </p><p>AND LIBYA (REFTEL) ON JULY 22 WITH MFA DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR </p><p>ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL AFFAIRS GIANDOMENICO MAGLIANO AND </p><p>NON-PROLIFERATION COORDINATOR UGO DE MOHR. THE MEETING </p><p>OCCURRED ON THE MARGINS OF BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS ON DUAL-USE </p><p>EXPORT CONTROLS, LED BY MAGLIANO AND MAGGI (TO BE REPORTED </p><p>SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>IRAN </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) IN RAISING THE POINTS ON IRAN, DAS MAGGI NOTED U.S. </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THE ATTENTION PAID TO OUR CONCERNS BY </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER FRATTINI AND OTHER GOI OFFICIALS, WHICH WE </p><p>UNDERSTOOD RESULTED IN THE ITALIAN FIRM FB DESIGN\'S PLACING A </p><p>TEMPORARY HOLD ON THE EXPORT OF ADDITIONAL PATROL BOATS TO </p><p>IRAN.  MAGGI URGED THE GOI TO ENSURE THAT THE HOLD BECOMES </p><p>PERMANENT. ECMIN STATED THAT WE ARE URGENTLY CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>THE STATUS OF THE SHIPMENTS THAT WERE PENDING AT THE TIME THE </p><p>GOI INFORMED US OF THE TEMPORARY HOLD. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) MAGGI SAID THAT THE U.S. RECOGNIZES THE GOI\'S </p><p>DIFFICULTY IN FORMALLY HALTING EXPORTS THAT DO NOT APPEAR TO </p><p>    FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ITALIAN EXPORT CONTROL LISTS. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE UNDERLINED HIGH U.S. ATTENTION TO FORCE </p><p>PROTECTION, PRESENTLY FOCUSED IN PARTICULAR ON IRAQ AND THE </p><p>PERSIAN GULF.  THE U.S. RAISES SUCH CONCERNS WITH OTHER </p><p>GOVERNMENTS WHENEVER WE BELIEVE AN EXPORT COULD BE A </p><p>POTENTIAL THREAT TO OUR FORCES. WE HAVE GONE AS FAR AS </p><p>CONFISCATING THE DELIVERY OF SIMILAR BOATS TO A COUNTRY IN </p><p>THE REGION, WHICH UNDERSCORES THE REAL THREAT SUCH VESSELS </p><p>CONSTITUTE.  EVEN IF IRAN CAN PROCURE SUCH BOATS ELSEWHERE, </p><p>AND EVEN GIVEN THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER THREATS, WE SHOULD WORK </p><p>TOGETHER TO STEM ANY THREATS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE, WHENEVER </p><p>WE CAN. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) MAGLIANO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF </p><p>POTENTIALLY THREATENING EXPORTS REQUIRED EFFORTS BY ALL </p><p>SIDES. HE NOTED HIS INTEREST TO HEAR OF OUR EFFORTS TO </p><p>PERSUADE OTHER COUNTRIES TO HALT THE TRANSFER OF SIMILAR </p><p>BOATS. HE THEN MENTIONED THE DELICATE NATURE OF ITALY\'S </p><p>LONGSTANDING TIES WITH IRAN, AND THE GOI\'S CONTINUED HOPES </p><p>FOR POSITIVE EVOLUTION WITHIN IRAN.  ITALY WAS CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT GIVING SIGNALS TO THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT THAT MIGHT </p><p>IMPEDE ITALIAN EFFORTS TO EFFECT POSITIVE CHANGES IN IRAN. </p><p>REGARDING FB DESIGN SPECIFICALLY, DE MOHR PROMISED TO CHECK </p><p>AGAIN ON THE STATUS OF THE SHIPMENT THAT HAD BEEN HALTED </p><p>EARLIER THIS YEAR, AND TO CONFIRIM THE FIRM\'S INTENTIONS </p><p>REGARDING ANY FUTURE EXPORTS TO IRAN. (DE MOHR SAID THE FIRM </p><p>PREVIOUSLY HAD TOLD HIM IT HAD NO INTENTION OF PURSUING </p><p>FURTHER BUSINESS IN IRAN.) </p><p> </p><p>LIBYA </p><p>----- </p><p></p><p>5. (S) MAGLIANO EMPHASIZED THE INCREASINGLY POSITIVE NATURE </p><p>OF ITALY\'S RELATIONS WITH LIBYA, INCLUDING LIBYA\'S </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH ITALY IN STEMMING ILLEGAL </p><p>IMMIGRATION, AN ISSUE OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE GOI.  UNLIKE </p><p>THE CASE OF IRAN, THE EXPORT OF PATROL BOATS AND RELATED </p><p>EQUIPMENT TO LIBYA WAS CLEARLY IN ITALY\'S NATIONAL INTERESTS. </p><p> ECMIN SAID THE U.S. UNDERSTANDS THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION </p><p>FROM NORTH AFRICA TO ITALY IS A MAJOR PREOCCUPATION OF THE </p><p>GOI.  NEVERTHELESS, THE U.S. CONTINUES TO HAVE VERY REAL </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT LIBYAN WMD DEVELOPMENT AND LINKS TO TERRORISM, </p><p>AND THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT\'S CONTINUED FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH </p><p>ALL UNSC PROVISIONS RELATED TO THE LOCKERBIE BOMBING. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) COMMENT: WHILE NEITHER MAGLIANO NOR DE MOHR OFFERED </p><p>ASSURANCES THAT THE TEMPORARY BLOCK ON FB DESIGN FAST BOAT </p><p>DELIVERIES WILL BECOME PERMANENT, THE PRESENTATION OF THE </p><p>DEMARCHE BY VISITING DAS MAGGI UNDOUBTEDLY IMPRESSED UPON THE </p><p>MFA WASHINGTON\'S CONTINUED CLOSE ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN CLEARED BY DAS MAGGI. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03386 - Classification: SECRET </p><p></p><p></p></div>
