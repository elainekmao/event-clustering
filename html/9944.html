<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 ABUJA 001340 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PGOV, PREL, KISL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>NEW CABINET AND ECONOMIC ADVISORS PART 2 </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1329 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE DAWN M. LIBERI; REASON: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) This is the second of Post,s biographic cables on </p><p>newly appointed GON ministers.  This cable focuses on the </p><p>President,s new economic team.  According to Embassy sources </p><p>and press reports, President Obasanjo is promoting his </p><p>economic team as a new generation of internationally </p><p>respected technocrats.  Nonetheless, several PDP insiders </p><p>have told Econoffs that Minister of Finance Okonjo-Iweala and </p><p>several economic advisers will likely not last long because </p><p>they are seen by many in the Cabinet as outsiders.  A </p><p>Minister of State confirmed that Obasanjo is seeking </p><p>international credibility with these new appointments but </p><p>will likely let his new appointees flounder as soon as they </p><p>have met their public relations usefulness. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Finance and Economy: Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A career bureaucrat, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was likely </p><p>appointed to her position by President Obasanjo because of </p><p>her contacts in and understanding of the Bretton Woods </p><p>Institutions and international reputation as a competent </p><p>administrator.  Some observers believe Okonjo-Iweala will </p><p>have a short tenure at Finance because many see her as an </p><p>outsider too removed from Nigeria\'s politics to survive. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Okonjo-Iweala threatened to resign in July for two </p><p>reasons.  One, President Obasanjo wanted to transfer the </p><p>control of the Budget and Planning function from the Ministry </p><p>to the Presidency.  The other was the designation of certain </p><p>ports for clearance of certain categories of imported goods </p><p>rather than giving the importers freedom to choose the ports </p><p>through which to bring in their goods.  The Minister withdrew </p><p>her resignation letter only after some assurances from the </p><p>President that she would have more monitoring power. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Praised by World Bank President James Wolfensohn for </p><p>her competence and professionalism, Okonjo-Iweala will likely </p><p>serve as Obasanjo\'s point person on debt relief with the </p><p>United States and Paris Club.  She will also likely act as </p><p>Obasanjo\'s chief negotiator with the Bank on its Nigeria </p><p>strategy for macroeconomic stability, improved systems for </p><p>budget formulation and execution and progress in overhauling </p><p>public procurement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Okonjo-Iweala joined the World Bank\'s Young </p><p>Professionals Program in 1982.  From 1982 to 2000, she worked </p><p>as an Economist and subsequently managed the East Asia, </p><p>Africa and Middle East portfolios.  Okonjo-Iweala is a board </p><p>member of several NGOs and think tanks including the African </p><p>Institute for Applied Economics, Enugu, Nigeria, which she </p><p>co-founded.  Okonjo-Iweala has participated in numerous </p><p>international conferences where she frequently speaks on </p><p>development issues confronting low-income countries </p><p>especially in Africa.  Dr. Okonjo-Iweala initially served the </p><p>Obasanjo Administration in 2000, when she took a leave of </p><p>absence to help Nigeria in managing its $28 billion foreign </p><p>debt, culminating in the setting up of the Debt Management </p><p>Office (DMO). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala graduated with an A.B. Magna Cum </p><p>Laude in Economics from Harvard University (1977) and holds a </p><p>Ph.D. in Regional Economics and Development from the </p><p>Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  In the last three </p><p>years, she has published several papers in development </p><p>journals and co-chaired a task force that examined how the </p><p>World Bank Group and the donor community can strengthen their </p><p>assistance to the poorest low-income countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Born in Ogwashi-Uku, Delta State, 49-year-old </p><p>Okonjo-Iweala is married to Nigerian surgeon and Emergency </p><p>Physician Ikemba Iweala and has four children.  Okonjo-Iwela </p><p>speaks English and several African Languages. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of State for Agriculture: Bamidele Dada </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Bamidele Dada was likely appointed to his post because </p><p>of his competence and extensive background in agriculture. </p><p>Until his nomination, Dada was the Food Agriculture </p><p>Organization (FAO) representative for Africa.  Prior to </p><p>working with FAO, Dada served in Nigeria\'s Federal Ministry </p><p>of Agriculture for 21 years.  Dada has written and spoken </p><p>extensively on methods for improving African agriculture </p><p>output. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Aviation: Isa Yuguda </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Competent and goal-oriented, Isa Yuguda is not an </p><p>aviation expert and was likely appointed to his position </p><p>because of his economic experience and close connection to </p><p>senior PDP officials.  Yuguda told U.S. officials in mid-July </p><p>that he wanted to improve relations with the United States </p><p>through the Department of Transportation, the FAA and the </p><p>Embassy.  He told Econoff that his main priority would be </p><p>improving Nigeria\'s aviation safety and security (and the </p><p>achievement of Category I Status). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Born in Bauchi State, Yuguda was Minister of State </p><p>for Transport from 2001 to 2003.  He was also Managing </p><p>Director/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of NAL Bank PLC after </p><p>his predecessor, Mr. Shamsudeen Usman, was appointed Deputy </p><p>Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria.  Yuguda became one </p><p>of NAL\'s branch managers at the age of 26 and was promoted to </p><p>bank MD at the age of 35.  By his own account, he was the </p><p>youngest MD in Nigeria\'s history.  Yuguda flaunts his wealth </p><p>with a fleet of luxury cars, beautiful homes and over 1,000 </p><p>head of cattle.  One on one, Yuguda is a quick read, engaging </p><p>and charismatic. </p><p>Ministry of Aviation, Permanent Secretary: Peter Okunromade </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) A well-respected career technocrat, Reverend Canon </p><p>Peter Okunromade has received high-marks from the Nigerian </p><p>press and Ministry of Aviation colleagues for his quiet and </p><p>effective leadership. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Okunromade graduated from the University of Lagos, </p><p>with a B.S. in Business Administration in 1972.  He worked </p><p>briefly for Shell Oil Company of Nigeria between from 1968 to </p><p>1969.  He then joined the Nigerian civil service, working his </p><p>way up through the ranks in the 1970s and 1980s.  He was </p><p>appointed Director, Planning Research and Statistics of the </p><p>Federal Capital Authority in 1988.  Before assuming his post </p><p>at the Ministry of Aviation, Okunromade served as Director </p><p>General of the Federal Ministry of Women and Youth </p><p>Development from 2001 to mid-2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Okunromade, an Anglican Church Minister, was born in </p><p>1944 in Ogun State.  He enjoys golf, singing and photography. </p><p> He is married with children. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Commerce: Alhaji Idris Waziri </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Former Nigerian Ambassador to Pakistan and career </p><p>diplomat Idris Waziri was a surprise choice by President </p><p>Obasanjo to head the Ministry of Commerce.  He is </p><p>well-connected in the PDP of Taraba State and wanted to </p><p>contest in the gubernatorial election against incumbent Jolly </p><p>Nyame.  Vice President Atiku personally persuaded Waziri to </p><p>drop his campaign, and this appointment is compensation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Communications: Chief Cornelius Adebayo </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Cornelius Adebayo is a respected politician, </p><p>technocrat and former Governor of Kwara State.  He was likely </p><p>appointed by President Obasanjo to gain another political </p><p>ally in Kwara State and because of Adebayo is Yoruba, but not </p><p>part of the Yoruba Afenifere organization that is often </p><p>opposed to Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) Adebayo graduated from Ahmadu Bello University and </p><p>the University of Ghana (Legon) in the 1960s.  Adebayo then </p><p>was a lecturer at the former University of Ife (now Obafemi </p><p>Awolowo University) in 1969.  He later founded the Department </p><p>of English at Kwara State College of Technology (Now Kwara </p><p>Polytechnics).  From 1973 to 1975, Adebayo was Commissioner </p><p>for Education in Kwara State and later headed the Department </p><p>of Information and Economic Development, respectively until </p><p>he went into politics and was elected Senator in 1979.  The </p><p>Minister was in the National Assembly until 1983, when he was </p><p>elected Governor of Kwara State, only to be ousted three </p><p>months later when the military dissolved Nigeria\'s Second </p><p>Republic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) In 1993, Adebayo shunned a ministerial offer by </p><p>Abacha\'s military regime, having been involved in </p><p>pro-democracy activism.  Abacha later detained him in Calabar </p><p>Prison, along with Chief Enahoro for championing Nigeria\'s </p><p>return to democratic government.  In 2000, when the AD needed </p><p>a respected and pragmatic politician to lead it, they </p><p>appealed to Adebayo to accept chairmanship of the party.  He </p><p>declined the offer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) Adebayo, who holds the traditional titles of Balogun </p><p>of Alla and Jajunmola of Oke-Onigbin, was born on February </p><p>24, 1941 in Igbaja.  Married with six children, the Minister </p><p>enjoys sports and traveling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Culture and Tourism: Franklin Ogbuawu </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) Ambassador Franklin Ogbuawu is a former local </p><p>government chairman and customs officer.  In 2003, he ran for </p><p>governor of Ebonyi State on the ANPP ticket and left the </p><p>party during the election process, which resulted in the </p><p>incumbent, Dr. Sam Egwu retaining the governorship.  He was </p><p>then rewarded with an ambassadorship to Greece. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Education: Fabian Osuji </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) Professor Fabian Ngozi Osuji was a member of the SDP </p><p>political machine and lost several elections to probable </p><p>machinations by former President Babangida and Senator </p><p>Nzeribe.  He most recently was teaching at the University of </p><p>Nigeria, Nsukka, where he was also chairman of the Governing </p><p>Council. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Environment: Bala Mande </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (U) Colonel Bala Mande, former military Governor of </p><p>Nasarawa State, ran this year on the PDP ticket for Governor </p><p>of Zamfara State where he lost to the incumbent Sanni Yerima. </p><p> Mande alleged widespread electoral malpractice as reasons </p><p>that led to his loss in the election.  His appointment was </p><p>likely a compensation for his loss in the last election. </p><p>Mande was Minister of State for Internal Affairs (1999-2003) </p><p>during Obasanjo\'s first term, and is close to National </p><p>Security Advisor Aliyu Mohammed. </p><p>Minister of Agriculture: Alhaji Adamu Bello </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) Alhaji Adamu Bello likely retained his portfolio </p><p>because of his political connections to Vice President Atiku; </p><p>both of whom are from Adamawa State.  It is widely thought </p><p>that the Vice President influenced Bello\'s 2001 appointment </p><p>as Minister of Agriculture because Bello was a close business </p><p>partner to the late Shehu Yar\'Adua, Atiku,s political </p><p>mentor.  Bello joined Habib Bank * owned by Yar\'Adua and his </p><p>family * in 1983 as Deputy Managing Director and served as </p><p>Chairman of the Board prior to becoming Managing Director in </p><p>1988.  Embassy sources stated that his reappointment to the </p><p>Ministry was disappointing because he has not been an </p><p>effective advocate of agriculture during the last two years. </p><p>For example, agricultural productivity has stagnated and </p><p>agriculture input prices, including fertilizers, have </p><p>increased dramatically. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. (U) The Minister attended Mayo Belwa Primary School, </p><p>Government Secondary School in Yola, and Ahmadu Bello </p><p>University, Zaria.  He also attended the University of </p><p>Pittsburgh and Harvard University.  He started his </p><p>professional career at the New Nigerian Development Company </p><p>(NNDC).  In addition to his interests in Habib Bank, Bello </p><p>holds significant shares in the Halal Fountain Hotel in </p><p>Kaduna and Intercity Bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) A Hausa-Fulani Muslim born on May 20, 1951, Bello is </p><p>married and holds the title Dan Iyan Adamawa.  He shies away </p><p>from political discussions and is more comfortable talking </p><p>about economic and business matters.  Despite his </p><p>shortcomings as an administrator, Bello is an intelligent, </p><p>friendly, engaging and articulate interlocutor.  Bello does </p><p>not have a strong background in agriculture and often defers </p><p>to his senior staff for expertise.  In talks with diplomats, </p><p>the Minister often tells his listener what they want to hear. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of State for Finance: Nenadi Esther Usman </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. (U) Nenadi Esther Usman was the Commissioner for Women </p><p>Affairs in Kaduna State and Governor Makarfi\'s Campaign </p><p>Coordinator. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Health: Professor Eyitayo Lambo </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26. (U) Eyitayo Lambo is an economist whose firm has </p><p>coordinated British donations for improving health services </p><p>in Africa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Housing/Urban Development: Mobolaji Osomo </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27. (U) Osomo was a former Minister of Education under the </p><p>Interim National Government (ING).  She has been touted as </p><p>having won the 1999 Alliance for Democracy gubernatorial </p><p>ticket in Ondo State but lost out to the tide of anti-Abacha </p><p>sentiments that held sway in the South-West at the time.  She </p><p>later joined the PDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Industries: Mogaji Mohammed </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>28. (U) Mogaji Mohammed, a former Permanent Secretary in four </p><p>different state ministries in Kaduna State, was most recently </p><p>Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.  Mogaji is also the father-in-law </p><p>of the current governor of Kaduna State, Mohammed Makarfi, </p><p>and has old ties to the PDM political machine. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Labor/Productivity: Husaini Zanuwa Akwanga </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>29. (U) A career civil servant, Husaini Zannuwa Akwanga was </p><p>the Secretary to the Governor of Nasarawa State from 1997 to </p><p>1998, and was Permanent Secretary for Internal Affairs from </p><p>1999 until retiring in March this year. </p><p>30. (U) Akwanga began his career as a classroom teacher, in </p><p>Nasarawa State in 1961 and continued teaching until 1984 when </p><p>he was transferred to the Federal Capital Development </p><p>Authority as Chief Inspector of Education. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>31. (U) Born on March 3, 1944, Akwanga graduated with a B.A. </p><p>(1976) and an M.Ed (1978) from Amadu Bello University. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Power and Steel: Liyel Imoke </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>32. (U) Liyel Imoke was the former Special Advisor on </p><p>Utilities, and was also a Senator in the early 1990\'s.  He </p><p>was the head of a taskforce charged with revamping the </p><p>Nigerian Electric Power Authority.  Much of the </p><p>responsibility for the lack of improvement in performance </p><p>during the last four years belongs to him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Science and Technology: Turner Isoun </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>33. (C) Professor Turner Isoun, first named Minister of </p><p>Science and Technology in September 2000, probably retained </p><p>his position in part because he is an ethnic Ijaw from the </p><p>politically volatile Bayelsa State.  He also has extensive </p><p>experience in the field and holds a Ph.D. in Veterinary </p><p>Pathology.  His home was destroyed during the Odi incident in </p><p>1999.  In 2000, Isoun replaced Chief Ebitimi Banigo, also </p><p>from Bayelsa, who was the first Minister in Obasanjo\'s </p><p>Cabinet to resign. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>34. (U) Isoun first met President Obasanjo in Nairobi 10 </p><p>years ago.  Isoun was pioneering a pan-African journal on </p><p>science and technology called Discovery Innovation and </p><p>Obasanjo was in Nairobi in connection with the Africa </p><p>Leadership Forum.  He interacted with Obasanjo on a number of </p><p>occasions at international academic conferences.  Isoun was </p><p>surprised when Obasanjo asked him to join the cabinet after </p><p>Banigo\'s resignation.  Like his predecessor, Isoun is a man </p><p>of integrity and well respected in the Niger Delta. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>35. (U) The Isouns\' home in Odi, Bayelsa was destroyed by a </p><p>joint military and police task force in November 1999.  After </p><p>Odi and before he became Minister, Isoun led a delegation of </p><p>residents of the town to see Obasanjo, during which Isoun </p><p>showed Obasanjo photographs of the devastation.  The </p><p>President reacted badly then, but Isoun says he refuses to </p><p>shy away from giving sound advice on sensitive issues.  Isoun </p><p>worked hard on Obasanjo\'s state visit to Bayelsa in March. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>36. (U) Isoun is an optimist by nature and takes great pains </p><p>not to criticize anyone directly.  His positive outlook makes </p><p>him particularly effective at motivating others.  He is </p><p>particularly proud of the newly launched National Strategy on </p><p>Information Technology.  Isoun just returned from Boston and </p><p>Seattle, where he gave speeches at the Harvard Business </p><p>School and at Microsoft. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>37. (U) Isoun holds a Ph.D. in Veterinary Pathology from </p><p>Michigan State University.  He returned to Nigeria and was </p><p>one of the founders of the Rivers State University of Science </p><p>and Technology in Port Harcourt.  Isoun became the </p><p>University\'s first Vice Chancellor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>38. (U) Isoun and his wife, Marian, run a non-governmental </p><p>organization called the Niger Delta Wetlands Center in Port </p><p>Harcourt.  The NDWC has a newly completed second office in </p><p>Yenagoa.  The NDWC focuses on environmental, human rights, </p><p>and conflict resolution issues and both Professor Isoun and </p><p>his wife are longstanding and reliable contacts on Delta </p><p>issues.  Marian, an American citizen, is one of our wardens </p><p>in Port Harcourt. Isoun was born on September 2, 1938. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Solid Minerals Odion Ugbesia </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>39. (U) Ugbesia is another returning minister and the only </p><p>Edo State representative in the Cabinet.  In Obasanjo\'s first </p><p>term he was the Minister of State for Internal Affairs, and </p><p>functioned more under the shadow of the former Works and </p><p>Housing Minister, Tony Anenih.  Ugbesia is often quiet and </p><p>goes unnoticed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>40. (U) He was more visible during the National Identity Card </p><p>registration exercise and ever since the exercise ended, </p><p>Ugbesia had reclined into his shell of silence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Transportation: Abiye Sekibo </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>41. (U) A medical doctor and prominent PDP politician from </p><p>Rivers State, Dr. Sekibo, was likely appointed to his post </p><p>due to his support in helping reelect Rivers State\'s Governor </p><p>Peter Odili. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>42. (U) Sekibo was the Secretary to Governor Peter Odili of </p><p>Rivers State, and has been blamed in some circles for the </p><p>murder of ANPP National Vice Chairman Marshall Harry in </p><p>March; his clinic was firebombed within a week of the murder. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Water Resources: Muktar Shagari </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>43. (C) Mukhtari Shagari, an Obasanjo loyalist and son of </p><p>former Head of State Shehu Shagari, was reappointed as </p><p>Minister of Water Resources.  Shagari likely retained his </p><p>position at the Ministry of Water Resources because he was </p><p>able to secure international assistance and domestic </p><p>investment to "improve" Nigeria\'s water resource during his </p><p>two years as Minister.  Shagari, who served as Minister of </p><p>Water Resources since June 2001, was one of President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s handpicked choices to return to the Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>44. (U) Shagari attended Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) in </p><p>Zaria.  Born in 1959, Mukhtari Shagari is from Sokoto State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Minister of Works: Adeseye Ogunlewe </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>45. (U) Former Senator Adeseye Ogunlewe was elected in 1999 </p><p>to the National Assembly under the Alliance of Democracy </p><p>(AD)ticket.  He later changed his allegiance to the PDP. </p><p>During the April elections, he lost his seat in the Senate to </p><p>the former Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, </p><p>Olorunimbe Mamora. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Economic Advisers: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Charles C. Soludo, Chief Economic Adviser to the President </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>46. (U) Charles C. Soludo, described by United States </p><p>officials as intelligent, worldly and energetic, was likely </p><p>appointed to his position by President Obasanjo because of </p><p>his international connections to leading economists and for </p><p>his pro debt relief stance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>47. (U) Before assuming his post, Soludo served as the </p><p>Executive Director of the African Institute for Applied </p><p>Economics (AIAE) Enugu, Nigeria.  He was also a Professor of </p><p>Economics at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.  Dr. Soludo </p><p>has consulted on debt relief and poverty reduction for the </p><p>Bretton Woods Institutions, UN agencies, and USAID. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>48. (U) Educated at Harvard University and Cambridge in the </p><p>United Kingdom, Soludo has co-edited numerous articles and </p><p>several books on African economic issues, including "African </p><p>Voices on Structural Adjustment" and "Sustainable Debt </p><p>Strategy in Nigeria".  Soludo is also a close friend of the </p><p>incoming Minister of Finance and Economy Dr. Ngozi </p><p>Okonjo-Iweala. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Senior Special Assistant, Head of Budget Monitoring and Price </p><p>Intelligence Unit: Dr. Oby Ezekwesili </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>49. (U) Oby Ezekwesili is an intelligent interlocutor who is </p><p>not afraid to speak-up or offer opinions.  According to </p><p>Embassy sources, President Obasanjo is promoting Ezekwesili </p><p>as part of a new generation of economic leaders in Nigeria. </p><p>Ezekwesili has been an advisor for more than two years, </p><p>lasting longer than thought possible by some insiders who </p><p>believed her position to be based only on the President\'s </p><p>short-term goal of presenting to the international community </p><p>that Nigeria\'s economic policy will improve under new and </p><p>respected advisers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Special Advisor/Director General Budget: Mr. Bode Augusto </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>50. (U) Before assuming his post, Augusto was Managing </p><p>Director of Augusto and Company Limited, a credit rating and </p><p>business information company.  He qualified as a chartered </p><p>accountant in 1981, obtaining the third prize in the overall </p><p>order of merit.  He worked with Price Waterhouse in Lagos and </p><p>London as an auditor, tax consultant and management </p><p>consultant. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>51. (U) Augusto also worked in Citibank Nigeria first as an </p><p>operations officer and later as a credit officer.
