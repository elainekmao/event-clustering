<p>UNCLAS ROME 001548 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR T, PM/DCT, NP/ECNP, PM/RSAT </p><p>DOD FOR OSD, PDASD/S&TR, DUSD/TSP, DIRDTSA/ST AND DTRSA/STP </p><p>DOD ALSO FOR USD (A&T)/ODUSD(I&CP) AND USD(A&T)/IDA </p><p>USDOC FOR BXA/EA/OAS AND BXA/EA/OSTFPC </p><p>NSC FOR TUCKER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, IT, KSTC, PARM, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY ON WASSENAAR HOS: NOT TO WORRY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01548  270942Z </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) MCBRIDE-VANSON 3/22 E-MAIL (B) VIENNA 449 </p><p> </p><p> 1. (U) ITALY SEES NO REMAINING SUBSTANTIVE WASSENAAR </p><p>ARRANGEMENT HEAD OF SECRETARIAT SUCCESSION ISSUE, MFA\'S </p><p>NONPROLIFERATION COORDINATOR UGO DE MOHR TOLD ECONOFF ON </p><p>MARCH 22.  ITALY ACCEPTS THAT THE SWEDISH CANDIDATE, </p><p>AMBASSADOR DANIELSSON, WILL BE THE NEXT HOS, AND DE MOHR SAID </p><p>ITALY IS FULLY SUPPORTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) DE MOHR ALLOWED THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME RECENT </p><p>"MISCOMMUNICATION" ABOUT ITALY\'S POSITION ON THE HOS SALARY </p><p>QUESTION.  ITALY AGREES THAT THE NEXT HOS SHOULD HAVE A </p><p>COMPENSATION PACKAGE EQUIVALENT TO A D2 RANK ON THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS PERSONNEL SCALE.  DE MOHR, HOWEVER, INSISTS THAT NO </p><p>REFERENCE BE MADE TO A D2 RANK IN THE FORMAL LETTER OF </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF THE HOS BECAUSE (1) WASSENAAR IS NOT PART OF </p><p>THE UN SYSTEM AND (2) REFERENCE TO A D2 RANK WOULD SEEM TO </p><p>THE WORLD TO BE A DOWNGRADING OF THE POSITION.  HE POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT THE LETTER OF APPOINTMENT PRESENTED FOUR YEAR AGO TO </p><p>INCUMBENT HOS LAURIOLA MADE NO REFERENCE TO RANK.  LAURIOLA, </p><p>LIKE DANIELSSON, CARRIES THE PERSONAL RANK OF AMBASSADOR, A </p><p>RANK DE MOHR BELIEVES LENDS USEFUL PRESTIGE TO THE HOS </p><p>POSITION.  ECONOFF COUNTERED THAT, IF THE POSITION CARRIED NO </p><p>EXPRESS RANK WHEN AMBASSADOR LAURIOLA OCCUPIED IT, IT COULD </p><p>HARDLY BE "DOWNGRADED" NOW. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) REPEATEDLY CHARACTERIZING THE HOS COMPENSATION </p><p>PACKAGE AS A MINOR ISSUE THAT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO </p><p>INTERFERE WITH THE ENHANCED IMPORTANCE OF WASSENAAR IN THE </p><p>POST 9-11 WORLD, DE MOHR NEVERTHELESS BELABORED THE MATTER. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01548  270942Z </p><p>HE COMPLAINED THAT THE TURKISH AND UKRAINIAN PLENARY CHAIRS </p><p>HAD NOT CIRCULATED A GOI LETTER OBJECTING TO THE DOWNGRADING </p><p>OF THE HOS POSITION.  ("THE TURKS," HE SAID, "LIED TO THE </p><p>UKRAINIANS FOR REASONS I WON\'T GO INTO.")  HE ALLEGED THAT </p><p>THE DRAFT COMPENSATION PACKAGE HAD IMPROPERLY BEEN SHOWED TO </p><p>A HOS CANDIDATE BEFORE BEING APPROVED BY THE MEMBERSHIP.  HE </p><p>DOUBTED THAT WASSENAAR WILL REALIZE A SAVINGS WITH THE NEW </p><p>CONTRACT BECAUSE THE NEW HOS MAY BE ENTITLED TO ADDITIONAL </p><p>BENEFITS (SEPARATION ALLOWANCE, ETC.) THAT CANNOT BE FULLY </p><p>CALCULATED UNTIL HE SUBMITS REQUISITE PAPERWORK.  HE, </p><p>HOWEVER, CONCLUDED THE SUBJECT ON AN UPBEAT NOTE, SAYING </p><p>"LET\'S NOT MAKE PROBLEMS THAT DON\'T EXIST" AS THE USG AND GOI </p><p>PREPARE TO WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER (AS WASSENAAR PLENARY CHAIR </p><p>AND EXPERTS COMMITTEE CHAIR RESPECTIVELY). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) COMMENT.  WE WON\'T PRESUME TO JUDGE WHETHER DE </p><p>MOHR\'S LATEST HOS FOOT-DRAGGING REFLECTS FURTHER </p><p>LAURIOLA-SAGA INTRIGUE OR WHETHER HE REALLY FEELS THE HOS </p><p>WOULD BE DIMINISHED BY AN EXPRESS D2 RANK.  IF APPROPRIATE AS </p><p>A WASSENAAR ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER, THE PATH OF LEAST </p><p>RESISTANCE WOULD BE TO SIMPLY DELETE ANY REFERENCE TO RANK IN </p><p>THE HOS LETTER OF APPOINTMENT.  DE MOHR MAINTAINS THAT\'S ALL </p><p>HE WANTS AND, NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THAT HAS GONE BEFORE IN THE </p><p>HOS MATTER, WE HAVE NEVER KNOWN HIM TO BE OVERTLY </p><p>DISINGENUOUS. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01548 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
