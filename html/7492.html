<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001098 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, CA, Liberal Party </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADIAN POLITICS: QUEBEC LIBERAL PARTY </p><p>VICTORY--WHAT DOES IT MEAN? </p><p> </p><p>REF: QUEBEC 55 </p><p> </p><p>1. By most accounts, the surprise victory of the Quebec </p><p>Liberal Party (QLP) in the  April 14 elections has sounded </p><p>the death knell for the separatist agenda.  In the words of </p><p>one pundit, QLP leader Jean Charest "is the first unambiguous </p><p>federalist to head a Quebec government in decades, a sign of </p><p>how much sovereignty (...) has turned into a dormant issue." </p><p>At the same time, Bloc Quebecois (the federal party) leader </p><p>Gilles Duceppe and others assert that 45 percent of Quebec </p><p>remains "sovereigntist" at heart and will keep the hope of a </p><p>separate Quebec alive by voting for the Bloc nationally. </p><p> </p><p>2. Both PM Chretien and his likely successor, Paul Martin, </p><p>have said they are pleased with the electoral outcome. </p><p>Martin graciously attributed this "federalist" victory in </p><p>Quebec to the retiring PM\'s tenacity on federation throughout </p><p>his tenure in politics.  Other observers of the </p><p>federal-provincial dynamic, however, caution that Charest, </p><p>for all his "federalist" credentials, is a strong proponent </p><p>of decentralization and thus likely to be more or a thorn in </p><p>the side of government on health care, housing, and other </p><p>issues that depend on federal funding allotments. </p><p>Nonetheless, the prospect of not having to deal with the </p><p>issue of sovereignty bodes well for Canada\'s next Prime </p><p>Minister, whoever he or she may be.  As the constitutional </p><p>critic for the Opposition (Canadian Alliance) told the press, </p><p>this is the first time in a long while that the threat of a </p><p>referendum "will not be hanging over our head." </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
