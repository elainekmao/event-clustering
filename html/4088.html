<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 006250 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS FOR ANE/MEA KIM FINAN </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PAUL THANOS </p><p>USDOC FOR 6400/ITA/TD/OEC/KFERGUSON </p><p>TREASURY FOR PIPATANAGUL </p><p>TDA FOR SIGLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ECPS, EAID, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ICT PROGRAMS IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) AMMAN 6060 B) STATE 203796 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Per REFTEL request, we are providing information on </p><p>telecom regulation, internet, and other IT-related questions </p><p>posed, as well as a description of ICT projects related to </p><p>education, business skills, business development, and </p><p>e-government in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>THE TRC: REGULATOR-IN-WAITING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Under the terms of the new Telecommunications Reform </p><p>Law passed last year, the Telecommunications Regulatory </p><p>Commission (TRC) becomes the sole regulator of telecom policy </p><p>in Jordan, now effective November 1, 2002.  As of that date, </p><p>the five member commission will be totally independent of the </p><p>Ministry of Information Communications and Technology </p><p>(MOICT).  The commissioners work full time, and are appointed </p><p>by the Council of Ministers under the recommendation of the </p><p>Minister of ICT, currently Dr. Fawaz Zu\'bi. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Unfortunately, various political and operational </p><p>considerations have delayed the appointment of the five </p><p>members, originally expected to have been made early in the </p><p>spring of 2002, until very recently, with a fifth slot yet to </p><p>be filled.  According to MOICT Policy Advisor Roger Guichard, </p><p>the TRC will be headed by Muna Nijem, former Director of Next </p><p>Generation Business Technology at Motorola.  Nijem will be </p><p>joined on the TRC by former TRC Director Mamoun Balqar, MOICT </p><p>Chief Information Officer Mahmoud Khasawneh, and Fadi Kawar, </p><p>Executive Director of Talal Abu Ghazaleh and Co.  The fifth </p><p>commissioner, designated as a lawyer slot, will be filled by </p><p>October 30, an earlier appointee having removed his name from </p><p>consideration. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) According to Guichard, Bob McDonald, formerly an </p><p>attorney for Regulatory Affairs for Sprint, has been hired to </p><p>work with the TRC on regulation and policy with USAID </p><p>funding.  Guichard said that now that the TRC is finally a </p><p>full-time, independent board, it can proactively address the </p><p>many challenging issues on its agenda, such as market </p><p>liberalization for mobile in 2004 and fixed-line in 2005, </p><p>interconnection rates, voice-over Internet Protocol, and pay </p><p>phone connection rates.  (Note: Guichard told us that Allo, a </p><p>major pay phone provider in Jordan, had its service cut off </p><p>by Jordan Telecom October 1 over a payment dispute.  As the </p><p>provision of this service is a public policy issue, the TRC </p><p>will step in and attempt to bring the parties to resolution. </p><p>End note) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Telecom Privatization </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Having begun the privatization of Jordan Telecom in </p><p>2000, with the support of the USAID-funded Executive </p><p>Privatization Commission, by selling 40% of the company to </p><p>France Telecom, 8 percent to the Social Security Corporation, </p><p>and 1 percent to the Jordan Telecom Employee Provident Fund, </p><p>the Government recently put up an additional 15% for sale via </p><p>an Initial Public Offering that closes on October 24. </p><p>Speculation on whether or not France Telecom will exercise </p><p>its option to buy a further 11% of JTC has been tempered by </p><p>the French company\'s announcement of a $12 billion loss for </p><p>the first half of 2002.  Under its new management, JTC has </p><p>succeeded in substantially reducing waiting time for new </p><p>lines and has expanded penetration.  Jordan Telecom\'s </p><p>fixed-line monopoly is set to expire in 2005, and a current </p><p>TDA-funded feasibility study is expected to show the need for </p><p>another market entrant to stimulate competition, improve </p><p>quality, and reduce costs, among the highest in the region. </p><p>Likewise, another feasibility study is likely to demonstrate </p><p>room for a third mobile operator, along side JT-owned </p><p>Mobilecom and Fastlink, a subsidiary of the Egyptian </p><p>conglomerate Orascom.  Mobile phone penetration has overtaken </p><p>fixed-line use in Jordan, with over 1.1 million mobile phones </p><p>currently in use and demand increasing.  The mobile duopoly </p><p>expires in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>COMMUNITY ICT CENTERS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) The Jordan Information Technology Community Centers </p><p>(JITCC) are small centers located throughout the country to </p><p>provide low-cost access to computers and computer related </p><p>technology.  To date, 40 of the planned 68 centers have been </p><p>established.  Open to all Jordanians, the centers provide </p><p>training courses that are tailored to the specific needs of </p><p>groups and individuals in the community.  Originally funded </p><p>by the UNDP, these centers are now funded by the King </p><p>Abdullah Fund and will receive technical assistance from </p><p>USAID\'s AMIR program and the Case Foundation.  USAID is </p><p>currently planning to conduct a sustainability study, which </p><p>it expects to conclude in six months.  The centers are </p><p>successful in that they provide IT access and training </p><p>previously unavailable in the more remote regions of Jordan. </p><p>The centers also host NetCorps, a training program designed </p><p>to field youth volunteers at the IT centers for up to six </p><p>months, and is supported by USAID.  INJAZ, the Jordanian </p><p>Junior Achievement Association, is using the centers for IT </p><p>access and training.  Computer Clubhouse is an IT program for </p><p>kids based at the centers. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Business development centers, known as Enterprise </p><p>Development Centers (EDCs) in Jordan,  are co-located with </p><p>the community ICT centers where appropriate.  The centers are </p><p>funded locally.  Business consultants are available through </p><p>the EDCs to offer support services and consultation also with </p><p>AMIR program support.  The EDCs are not yet self-sustaining. </p><p>Other activities under consideration include a comprehensive, </p><p>integrated, competitive placement based Women\'s </p><p>Entrepreneurial Development Center, a Women in ICT program </p><p>which aims to increase employment opportunities for women </p><p>through training on market needs, improving access to IT </p><p>technology, establishing linkages with IT companies, and a </p><p>review of Sector Based Training focusing training needs on </p><p>certain sectors with identified growth potential. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR NEEDS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The REACH program, the Jordanian government\'s </p><p>strategy for developing its IT sector, and INTAJ have created </p><p>an environment in which business and government work together </p><p>to develop a globally competitive IT industry in Jordan. </p><p>Having said that, a recent independent study of Jordan\'s IT </p><p>industry commissioned by the MOICT and conducted by IT </p><p>consulting firm McConnell International (REF A) asserted that </p><p>the needs of small and medium enterprises are not being </p><p>adequately addressed by the government or the private sector. </p><p> The report also states the ICT adoption rate among </p><p>businesses is low, as is the rate of credit card penetration </p><p>necessary for the growth of e-commerce.  While training </p><p>opportunities are increasing, via AMIR, INTAJ, and private </p><p>sector players such as INTEL and Microsoft, businesses </p><p>complain of a dearth of technically savvy IT professionals </p><p>with management and marketing skills.  In addition, the high </p><p>cost and low quality of international service has been a </p><p>deterrent to foreign investment and participation in global </p><p>e-commerce. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>INTERNET CAFES </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Internet cafes are prevalent in Jordan.  Privately </p><p>owned, these small shops typically contain 4 to 5 PCs and </p><p>generate small profits.  Under regulations now being more </p><p>zealously enforced by the government, cafes must register IDs </p><p>for users, as well as log sites visited and maintain the log </p><p>for 60 days pending inspection by officials of the Ministry </p><p>of the Interior, or risk paying large fines.  A number of </p><p>cafes, most recently in Irbid, have recently been closed due </p><p>to their inability to pay these fines. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>ICT PROJECTS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) The primary vehicle for USAID support to the ICT </p><p>sector in Jordan is the AMIR Program (Achievement of </p><p>Market-Friendly Initiatives and Results).  The objective of </p><p>AMIR\'s ICT initiatives is to support Jordan in becoming a </p><p>leading regional ICT hub and a competitive exporter of ICT </p><p>products and services.  These initiatives promote increased </p><p>ICT access and connectivity for all Jordanians, utilize IT to </p><p>facilitate the provision of government service, promote </p><p>increased business growth and employment in the sector, and </p><p>helps upgrade human resources with respect to IT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) Jordan,s IT Industry association, INTAJ, has </p><p>received grant support from USAID for staff training, </p><p>e-commerce workshops, lobbying in favor of IT-related </p><p>reforms, human resources development, and other projects.  In </p><p>addition, INTAJ, with the support of USAID, held the </p><p>successful ICT Forum (REF A) in Amman September 30-October 1. </p><p> The Forum, which attracted more than 1200 participants from </p><p>the Middle East, Europe, Asia and the United States, featured </p><p>INTEL CEO Craig Barrett, John Gage of Sun Microsystems, and </p><p>George Vradenburg form AOL-Time Warner as keynote presenters. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) USAID has assisted the government in producing the </p><p>REACH initiative, Jordan\'s national IT strategy.  The plan </p><p>calls for the creation of 20,000 IT-related jobs, $550 </p><p>million in IT exports, and $150 million in FDI, all by 2004. </p><p>With UNDP assistance, the Ministry of Education has invested </p><p>$67 million in an ongoing program to provide IT training to </p><p>6000 teachers.  The Ministry of Information Communications </p><p>and Technology (MOICT) has also introduced the Connecting </p><p>Jordanians initiative, a national campaign to improve and </p><p>ensure Internet access throughout the Kingdom. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) The Jordanian Government\'s e-government strategy is </p><p>also supported by USAID through the AMIR program.  A number </p><p>of infrastructure projects have been initiated, including the </p><p>secure government network government E-mail System, Operation </p><p>and Data Center, and portal website. Other e-services, such </p><p>as the Business Registration unit at the Ministry of Industry </p><p>and Trade and the Investment Promotion Information System are </p><p>expected to be ready in early 2003.  In addition, an </p><p>e-government Program Management Office (PMO) has been </p><p>established to coordinate e-government initiatives and to </p><p>implement other projects across the public sector. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) The MOICT has embarked on the ambitious task of </p><p>training government employees in computer literacy. To this </p><p>end, the Ministry has adopted UNESCO,s International </p><p>Computer Drivers Licensing (ICDL) program as an effective </p><p>vehicle for the promotion of computer literacy in  Jordan. </p><p>Likewise, to enable the use of e-Government applications and </p><p>services supported by AMIR, ICTI has provided management, </p><p>communication, logistical and other local support to </p><p>facilitate the provision of the ICDL Program. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (U) USAID\'s ICT support also extends to enhancing </p><p>computer education in universities, expanding the ministry of </p><p>Education\'s e-Learning Network, and providing technical </p><p>assistance to encourage outreach and innovation and increased </p><p>access throughout primary and secondary schools.  In 2001, </p><p>AMIR and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) </p><p>began working with the MoICT, Intaj, and other stakeholders </p><p>to develop a strategy for connecting Jordanians to the global </p><p>information superhighway, now known as the Connecting </p><p>Jordanians Initiative (CJI).  USAID has worked closely with </p><p>the stakeholders involved in CJI to develop and implement a </p><p>comprehensive connectivity business plan for Jordan.  The </p><p>first draft of this business plan was completed and presented </p><p>at the end of August 2002. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) In addition to USAID-funded assistance, the EU is </p><p>providing some industry-level support.  In the past, the </p><p>British, World Bank and EU have been involved in establishing </p><p>the TRC.  The UNDP is supporting the development of the </p><p>Jordan Information Technology Community Centers. In addition, </p><p>CIDA is working closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE) </p><p>in supporting the Ministry\'s e-learning strategic framework. </p><p>The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is also now </p><p>considering major support for the rollout of the MOE,s </p><p>e-learning network.  There are also a number of U.S. </p><p>corporate sponsors of Jordan,s ICT initiatives including </p><p>Microsoft, Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett Packard and </p><p>Oracle.  Given the important role of such firms in developing </p><p>Jordan,s ICT industry, strategic alliances involving the </p><p>GOJ, donors and U.S. ICT firms are becoming increasingly </p><p>important. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
