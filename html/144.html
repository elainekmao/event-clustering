<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 CAIRO 26111 </p><p> </p><p>E.O.:  12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, PINS, EG, US </p><p>SUBJ:  "NO NASSERISM, ONLY NASSERISTS" </p><p> </p><p>REF:  CAIRO 22742 </p><p> </p><p>1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  "NASSERISM" HAS GAINED PUBLICITY AND </p><p>TOPICALITY IN RECENT MONTHS (REFTEL), BUT NEITHER A </p><p>COHERENT IDEOLOGY NOR A BROAD BASED POLITICAL MOVEMENT HAS </p><p>EMERGED TO GIVE DEFINITION TO THE TERM.  THE MOST CREDIBLE </p><p>ATTEMPT TO FORM A MOVEMENT IS THE SQUARELY ANTI-U.S., </p><p>ANTI-ISRAEL  "ARAB SOCIALIST NASSERIST PARTY" (ASNP), NOW </p><p>IN THE LEGAL LIMBO OF "PARTY UNDER ESTABLISHMENT."  A NEW </p><p>WEEKLY NASSERIST NEWSPAPER CLAIMS INDEPENDENCE FROM THE </p><p>ASNP, BUT CLEARLY HAS LINKS TO IT OF DUBIOUS LEGALITY. </p><p>MUBARAK HAS TOLERATED BUT CAREFULLY CIRCUMSCRIBED THE </p><p>RE-EMERGENCE OF NASSERIST VISIBILITY.  THE NASSERISTS </p><p>CLEARLY POSE NO IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE REGIME, AND ARE </p><p>LOCKED IN HOSTILE COMPETITION WITH ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS IN </p><p>THE ATTEMPT TO BEND POPULAR ECONOMIC DISSATISFACTION INTO </p><p>POLITICAL SUPPORT.  THE NASSERISTS\' PRIMARY SIGNIFICANCE </p><p>IS THEIR THEORETICAL POTENTIAL TO INCITE OPPOSITION TO </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORM, ADDING TO MUBARAK\'S CAUTION IN ECONOMIC </p><p>DECISIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  NASSER\'S GHOST:  REFTEL REPORTED DIVERSE ELEMENTS OF </p><p>AN APPARENT RE-EMERGENCE OF  "NASSERIST " POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVITY, NOTABLY:  MOHAMMED HASSANEIN HEIKAL\'S </p><p>RE-APPEARANCE IN PRINT; ESTABLISHMENT OF A PLAINLY </p><p>NASSERIST WEEKLY NEWSPAPER; PROMINENT OFFICIAL </p><p>COMMEMORATION ON 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF NASSER\'S </p><p>NATIONALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL AND HIS SUBSEQUENT </p><p>EMERGENCE AS A NATIONAL HERO IN THE 1956 WAR; AND </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF A PROSPECTIVE NEW NASSERIST </p><p>POLITICAL PARTY.  THERE IS LINGERING, PERHAPS EVEN </p><p>MARGINALLY REVIVED POPULAR NOSTALGIA FOR ELEMENTS OF </p><p>NASSER\'S LEGACY.  NEVERTHELESS, THIS SELECTIVE NOSTALGIA </p><p>IS VOICED MAINLY AMONG INTELLECTUALS AND THE LOWER MIDDLE </p><p>CLASS PUBLIC SECTOR AND GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, WHO </p><p>PROSPERED UNDER NASSER.  EVEN THE DEMAGOGIC LEFTIST </p><p>OPPOSITION HAS AVOIDED PROMINENT PLAY OF NASSERISM AND THE </p><p>BRUITED NASSERIST REVIVAL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MUBARAK AND REVISIONIST NASSERISM:  IN HIS SPEECHES IN </p><p>SEPTEMBER AROUND THE ANNIVERSARY OF NASSER\'S DEATH, </p><p>MUBARAK LAID CLAIM AS THE TRUE HEIR OF NASSERIST </p><p>NATIONALISM AND INDEPENDENCE FROM SUPERPOWER DOMINATION, </p><p>BUT DISTINGUISHED HIS OWN APPROACH FROM NASSER\'S IN KEY </p><p>AREAS (PEACE WITH ISRAEL, DEMOCRACY, ECONOMIC REFORM). </p><p>BESIDES REVISING THE VALUES OF NASSERISM, THE MUBARAK </p><p>GOVERMENT IS TOYING WITH THE NEW "NASSERISTS."  IT </p><p>EFFECTIVELY HAS LURED THEM ABOVE GROUND BY PERMITTING </p><p>PRE-ORGANIZATIONAL POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND PRESS </p><p>INTERVIEWS, WHILE ARRESTING SOME ACTIVISTS AND WARNINQ AT </p><p>LEAST ONE WOULD-BE LEADER OF THE LIMITS ON HIS </p><p>ACTIVITIES.  THE NASSERISTS ARE THEMSELVES (UNADMITTED) </p><p>REVISIONISTS, CLAIMING TO PROMINENT PROSPECTIVE RECRUITS </p><p>THAT THEY HAVE DISCARDED NASSER\'S AUTHORITARIANISM. </p><p>EVIDENTLY THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE MEMORY OF NASSER\'S </p><p>OPPRESSION ALSO REMAINS VIVID FOR SOME. </p><p> </p><p>5.  NASSERISTS VS NASSERISM.  NASSER CONFIDANT AND </p><p>CHRONICLER MOHAMMED HASSANEIN HEIKAL APTLY HAS </p><p>CHARGED IN PUBLISHED INTERVIEWS AND PRIVATE CON- </p><p>VERSATIONS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS "NASSERISM, </p><p>BUT ONLY NASSERISTS" TAKING PERSONAL INITIATIVES. </p><p>ABSENT THE GREAT HERO HIMSELF OR A BODY OF SEMINAL </p><p>PUBLICATIONS TO GUIDE HIS HEIRS, NO COHERENT POLITICAL </p><p>PHILOSOPHY EXISTS TO UNIFY THEM.  COMPETING </p><p>NASSERISTS ARE ALLEGEDLY ACTIVE IN EACH OF THE </p><p>ESTABLISHED POLITICAL PARTIES; THE REMNANTS OF THE </p><p>DORMANT "EGYPT PARTY"; A PROSPECTIVE NEW NASSERIST </p><p>PARTY; A NEW WEEKLY NEWSPAPER; AND EVEN AMONG </p><p>ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS.   THE TERM "NASSERIST" IS </p><p>USED LOOSELY AND DISPARAGINGLY:  THE FREE-MARKET </p><p>WAFDISTS, LIBERALS, AND MEMBERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE </p><p>SIDE OF THE NDP REGULARLY ACCUSE MUBARAK OF TOLER- </p><p>ATING NASSERISTS (IF NOT OUTRIGHT MARXISTS) AMONG </p><p>HIS SENIOR ADVISORS, USING AS EXAMPLES (WITHOUT </p><p>EXPLANATION) OSAMA AL BAZ AND SPEAKER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT RIFA\'AT MAHGOUB.  THE RIGHT SUSPECTS </p><p>NEW PM ATIF SIDQI FOR HIS PAST ASSOCIATION WITH </p><p>NASSER THROUGH MAHGOUB.  ONE WELL-CONNECTED, INDE- </p><p>PENDENT POLITICAL SCIENTIST CLAIMED THAT THE NASSER- </p><p>ISTS ARE DELIBERATELY PURSUING THEIR OBJECTIVES IN </p><p>MULTIFARIOUS CHANNELS, NOT QUITE AT ODDS WITH EACH </p><p>OTHER BUT NOT QUITE COOPERATING EITHER, AS A </p><p>MEANS TO EVADE GOVERNMENT PRESSURE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  FARID ABDEL KARIM AND THE ASNP:  THE MOST PRO- </p><p>MINENT OF THE NASSER REVIVALISTS -- AND PERHAPS </p><p>LEAST LIKELY TO FAIL -- IS CONTROVERSIAL LAWYER </p><p>FARID ABDEL KARIM, THE "DEPUTY" OF THE NEW "ARAB </p><p>SOCIALIST NASSERIST PARTY" (ASNP).  THE ASNP IS NOW </p><p>IN THE LEGAL LIMBO DEFINED AS "UNDER ESTABLISHMENT." </p><p>THAT GIVES THE ASNP THE DISADVANTAGES OF BEING OUT </p><p>IN THE OPEN, AND HENCE EASY MONITORING BY THE GOVERN- </p><p>MENT -- WITHOUT THE ADVANTAGES THAT GO WITH BEING </p><p>COMPLETELY LEGAL:  HAVING A REGULAR PUBLIC VOICE (SEE </p><p>PARA 8), OR UNRESTRICTED ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES. </p><p>ABDEL KARIM TOLD POLOFF THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO IMPORTANT </p><p>POLITICAL FORCES IN EGYPT TODAY:  NASSERISM AND ISLAM, </p><p>NEITHER OF WHICH ARE REPRESENTED BY POLITICAL PARTIES. </p><p>ABDEL KARIM CLAIMS THE NASSERISTS BELIEVE IN TRUE </p><p>DEMOCRACY, AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PERMIT </p><p>ALL THOSE DESIRING POLITICAL PARTIES TO FORM THEM. </p><p>IN THIS CASE, THE ISLAMIC ELEMENTS WOULD QUICKLY </p><p>LOSE THEIR POPULARITY IN THEIR FRACTIOUSNESS.  ON </p><p>THE OTHER HAND, THE OVERWHELMING POPULAR SUPPORT </p><p>FOR NASSERISM -- ABDEL KARIM CLAIMS 100,000 FOUNDING </p><p>MEMBERS -- WOULD ASSURE THE PRIMACY OF HIS PARTY. </p><p>ABDEL KARIM SAID THE ASNP AIMS NOT TO TAKE POWER, </p><p>BUT TO UNITE THE NASSERISTS ONLY TO LEAD THE LEGI- </p><p>TIMATE OPPOSITION THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS.  HE PRO- </p><p>FESSED SATISFACTION AT THE RECENT GOVERNMENT PRESSURE </p><p>ON HIMSELF AND OTHER NASSERISTS, CLAIMING THAT THIS </p><p>IS A POWERFUL UNIFYING FACTOR.  HE EXPLAINED THAT HE </p><p>USES THE TITLE "DEPUTY" ("WAKEEL") -- ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>IS THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF THE NEW PARTY, BECAUSE </p><p>NO FORMAL ELECTION OF A PRESIDENT CAN BE HELD UNTIL </p><p>THE PARTY EMERGES FROM "UNDER ESTABLISHMENT." </p><p> </p><p>7.  FOREIGN POLICY:  AS IN HIS PUBLISHED INTERVIEWS, ABDEL </p><p>KARIM MADE CLEAR THAT TWO KEY ELEMENTS OF ASNP POLICY ARE </p><p>OPPOSITION TO U.S. "INFLUENCE" IN EGYPT AND TO PEACEFUL </p><p>EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI TIES.  HE CHARGED US PRESSURE IS THE </p><p>PRIMARY REASON THAT THE GOVERNMENT STILL HAS NOT PERMITTED </p><p>FULL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ASNP AND HAS SUSPENDED ITS </p><p>PUBLICATION, "AL ISHTIRAKI", AFTER ONLY TWO ISSUES </p><p>(PHOTOCOPIES POUCHED INR).  NONETHELESS, HE WELCOMED THE </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR A DIALOGUE, AND CLAIMED MANY PERSONAL </p><p>FRIENDSHIPS WITH AMERICANS.  HE ALSO IMPLIED THAT HE </p><p>OPPOSES U.S. INFLUENCE IN EGYPT PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF HIS </p><p>MANIFEST HATRED FOR ISRAEL, RATHER THAN FOR ANY PURELY </p><p>NATIONALIST OR IDEOLOGICAL MOTIVATION.  ABDEL KARIM DENIED </p><p>LINKS BETWEEN THE NASSERISTS AND QADDAFI, CHARGING THAT </p><p>QADDHAFI IS NASSERISM\'S WORST ENEMY.  HE SAID QADDHAFI </p><p>SEEKS ALLIANCE WITH NASSERISM TO DOMINATE IT, BUT THE </p><p>NASSERISTS REFUSE HIS BLANDISHMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  "SAWT AL ARAB":  AN EXAMPLE OF THE CONFUSED AND </p><p>COMPETING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG LEADING NASSERIST LIGHTS IS </p><p>THE CASE OF THE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED "SAWT AL ARAB" </p><p>NEWSPAPER AND ITS FOUNDER-EDITOR, ABDEL AZIM MANAF, WHO </p><p>HAS AVOIDED EMBASSY CONTACT.  HEIKAL (FOR ONE) DENIED THAT </p><p>"SAWT AL ARAB" IS A NASSERIST ORGAN, CHARGING (AS DO MANY </p><p>OF OUR INTERLOCUTORS) THAT MANAF IS ON THE LIBYAN </p><p>PAYROLL.  ONE OF MANAF\'S FORMER UNIVERSITY MENTORS SAID </p><p>MANAF IS A "FANATIC," BUT FIRMLY DENIED THE PREVALENT </p><p>BELIEF THAT MANAF GETS LIBYAN FUNDING, CLAIMING SAWT AL </p><p>ARAB IS INSTEAD SUPPORTED BY THE SONS OF NASSER.  FOR HIS </p><p>PART, FARID ABDEL KARIM DENIES LINKS WITH MANAF OR HIS </p><p>NEWSPAPER; HE ALSO DENIES THAT MANAF HAS POLITICAL </p><p>CONNECTIONS WITH LIBYA OR THE SONS OF NASSER. THE OFFICE </p><p>OF SAWT AL ARAB ALSO DENIES CONNECTIONS WITH ABDEL KARIM\'S </p><p>ASNP, ALTHOUGH THE PAPER HEAVILY COVERS ABDEL KARIM AND </p><p>TOUTS A NASSERIST LINE.  THE PRACTICAL BUT UNOFFICIAL LINK </p><p>BETWEEN THE ASNP AND SAWT AL ARAB IS DARING, BECAUSE UNTIL </p><p>THE ASNP IS FORMALLY ESTABLISHED IT MAY NOT LEGALLY </p><p>PUBLISH A REGULAR NEWSPAPER.  MININT ZEKI BADR COULD CLOSE </p><p>BOTH ORGANIZATIONS AT HIS PLEASURE ON THIS LEGAL BASIS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT.  WE DETECT NO CONSENSUAL UNDERSTANDING OF </p><p>WHAT THE TERM "NASSERISM" MEANS, AND NO POPULAR BASIS FOR </p><p>A REVIVAL OF NASSERISM AS A POLITICAL MOVEMENT, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN THE ABSENCE OF A SIMILARLY CHARISMATIC </p><p>NATIONAL HERO.  AS HEIKAL SUGGESTED, THE ESSENCE OF </p><p>NASSERISM, AND THAT FOR WHICH SOME NOSTALGIA REMAINS, WAS </p><p>THE MAN AND HIS IMAGE, RATHER THAN ANY COHERENT BODY OF </p><p>IDEAS.  MANY PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS AND GOVERNMENT </p><p>EMPLOYEES PROBABLY DO SHARE LEFTIST INTELLECTUALS\' </p><p>RESENTMENT AT THE PERCEIVED U.S. PRESSURE ON MUBARAK AND </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT ECONOMIC MEASURES THEY CONSIDER </p><p>INIMICAL TO THEIR INTERESTS.  MANY EGYPTIANS NO DOUBT ALSO </p><p>SHARE THE NASSERISTS\' BITTER ANTI-ISRAELI ATTITUDES, BUT </p><p>SUCH ATTITUDES ARE ALSO HELD BY ISLAMIC OPPONENTS OF </p><p>NASSERISM, AND DO NOT DETERMINE AN INDIVIDUAL\'S </p><p>IDENTIFICATION AS A "NASSERIST."  THE CHIEF IMPLICATION OF </p><p>LATTER DAY NASSERISM FOR U.S. INTERESTS IS ITS POTENTIAL </p><p>TO DIMINISH POPULAR SUPPORT, OR AT LEAST TOLERANCE, FOR </p><p>THE ECONOMIC REFORMS REQUIRED FOR EGYPTIAN STABILITY. </p><p>THEY LACK ORGANIZATION AND MASS APPEAL, SO THEIR </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS IN ACTUALLY INCITING THE PEOPLE AGAINST </p><p>ECONOMIC REFORMS PROBABLY WOULD BE ONLY MARGINALLY </p><p>INCREASED IF THEY EVENTUALLY ARE PERMITTED TO FORM A </p><p>LEGITIMATE PARTY (OR PARTIES) UNDER THE CURRENT INFORMAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WISNER </p><p></p></div>
