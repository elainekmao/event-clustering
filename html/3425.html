<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002321 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/PD (SKOP), IIP/G/AF (BOCHNER, HOWARD) </p><p>LAGOS FOR PAS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, SCUL, OIIP, PTER, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S. SPEAKER ANA ARANA: WORKSHOP BRINGS TO </p><p>LIFE STRATEGIES FOR INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY: A dozen journalists drawn from </p><p>independent and government-owned print and </p><p>electronic media in Abuja participated in a two-and- </p><p>a-half-day workshop on investigative journalism, </p><p>July 15-17.  Ana Arana, consultant for Inter- </p><p>American Press Association, used story ideas </p><p>suggested by the journalists and a simulated press </p><p>conference with a government official to lead </p><p>participants through a systematic process of </p><p>applying investigative journalism techniques. </p><p>Participants said at the end of the workshop that </p><p>they would put their newly acquired skills into </p><p>practice. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY: The workshop started </p><p>with a simple identification exercise where each </p><p>participant was asked to say why he/she became a </p><p>journalist.  From their responses Arana gave the </p><p>first lesson of the workshop: "Journalism is a </p><p>passion, not just a job."  This was followed by an </p><p>exercise on news values, and a mock press conference </p><p>with the chairman of the Nigerian Senate Aviation </p><p>Committee that probed his views on aviation safety </p><p>in Nigeria.  Afterward, Arana critiqued the skills </p><p>of the participants in asking questions and </p><p>identifying leads from the responses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The second day witnessed more intense discussions as </p><p>Arana took the class through the process of </p><p>organizing various story ideas, including aviation </p><p>safety, elections and religious violence. </p><p>Throughout, Arana emphasized that writing </p><p>investigative reports is a process that needs </p><p>organization, careful thinking and questioning.  The </p><p>program included tips on investigative techniques, </p><p>cultivating sources and principles of good </p><p>reporting.  The workshop concluded with a video clip </p><p>and discussion on journalistic ethics--a crucial </p><p>issue in Nigeria.  Most participants admitted that </p><p>they or their colleagues had received "brown </p><p>envelopes" in return for favorable coverage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  JUSTIFICATION AND OBJECTIVE: Nigeria may have </p><p>the most vibrant press in Africa, a press that </p><p>endured decades of military dictatorships and helped </p><p>to pave the way for the transition to democracy. </p><p>Since then, the press has shown a robust willingness </p><p>to criticize government policies, personalities and </p><p>programs. But reporting is short on accuracy and </p><p>long on sensationalism.  Journalists lack </p><p>investigative skills and a clear understanding of </p><p>the role of the press in ensuring responsible </p><p>governance.  The workshop was intended to provide </p><p>skills and attitudes that will help the press </p><p>fulfill its role. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. MPP UMBRELLA THEME AND AUDIENCE REACHED: </p><p>Strengthening of democracy.  Audience was a targeted </p><p>group of twelve journalists drawn from independent </p><p>and government-owned print and electronic media in </p><p>Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. USG SUPPORT: Excellent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. RESULT/IMPACT: Very good. Arana was effective in </p><p>communicating to participants that doing </p><p>investigative reporting is a process that needs </p><p>careful organization and specific skills which she </p><p>illustrated through exercises.  Her interactive </p><p>approach involved and energized the participants, </p><p>who left with a greater appreciation of the </p><p>importance of investigative reporting in ensuring </p><p>good governance.  Some said they would take up the </p><p>issue of aviation safety and we are waiting to see </p><p>how they will tackle this and other key issues </p><p>facing Nigeria. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
