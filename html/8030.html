MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  05/19/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, CE, TH, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Sri Lankan government requests assistance re </p><p>reported arrest of LTTE personnel in Thailand </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) SA/INS-Colombo 05/17/03 unclass e-mail </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) FBIS Reston Va DTG 131145Z May 03 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Over the May 17-18 weekend, key Sri Lankan </p><p>minister Milinda Moragoda spoke with Ambassador Wills </p><p>several times re the May 12 arrest of three suspected </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) members in </p><p>Thailand on weapons charges (see Para two for more </p><p>details).  Minister Morogoda expressed concern about the </p><p>situation, commenting that LTTE personnel had been </p><p>mysteriously released from custody in Thailand in </p><p>previous such cases.  Morogoda attributed this to the </p><p>LTTE\'s bribing of Thai officials.  Morogoda stressed </p><p>that the GSL wanted the suspects to remain in custody </p><p>while the case is investigated and prosecuted.  Morogoda </p><p>requested that the U.S. press the Thai government on </p><p>this matter, urging it to cooperate fully with the GSL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Based on what Mission has heard from news </p><p>reports and from contacts, the three suspected Tiger </p><p>personnel were arrested on May 12 in a hotel in the town </p><p>of Ranong, some 570 kilometers south of Bangkok.  The </p><p>men were reportedly in possession of 13 semi-automatic </p><p>pistols and nearly 50,000 rounds of ammunition.  The </p><p>three were identified as Asseervathan Sathyapavan (35), </p><p>Thevarajah Sasiharan (29), and Gunapala Sugiv (27).  The </p><p>men reportedly admitted obtaining the weapons for the </p><p>LTTE.  According to reports, the men were charged by </p><p>Thai authorities with illegal possession of firearms and </p><p>the carrying of firearms in public.  (Note:  In his </p><p>conversation with Ambassador Wills on May 16, Minister </p><p>Morogoda told the Ambassador that the GSL had </p><p>information that notorious Tiger supply head K. </p><p>Pathmanathan, a.k.a., "KP," was en route to Thailand, </p><p>apparently with the intention of securing the release of </p><p>the LTTE personnel through fair means or foul.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT:  Given Morogoda\'s deep concern, we </p><p>suggest that Embassy Bangkok urge the Thai government to </p><p>cooperate fully with the GSL on this matter.  (Note:  We </p><p>have heard unconfirmed press reports that Sri Lankan </p><p>government officials are already en route to Bangkok to </p><p>discuss the case with the Thai government.)  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
