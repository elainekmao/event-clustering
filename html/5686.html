<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 000967 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ASEC, SOCI, ECON, KPAL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PILLARS OF THE REGIME PART II OF IV: THE EAST BANK </p><p>TRIBES </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 6535 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Traditionally, the most important pillar of the </p><p>Hashemite regime has been its East Bank constituency, </p><p>including both Bedouin and non-nomadic tribes.  East Bank </p><p>tribes have also played an integral role in the other pillars </p><p>that have emerged--the military/security services and the </p><p>economic elite.  However, reform-minded King Abdullah may </p><p>face problems as he tries to move Jordan into the 21st </p><p>century while seeking to maintain the support of the most </p><p>conservative elements of Jordanian society--the East Bank </p><p>tribes.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>WHO ARE THE TRIBES? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The East Bank tribes of Jordan constitute roughly </p><p>35-45 percent of the total population of Jordan.  The </p><p>Bedouins--nomadic tribes--make up roughly seven percent of </p><p>the population.  The Bedouin tribes, including the </p><p>historically famous Howeitat (of Lawrence of Arabia fame), </p><p>were instrumental in the formation of the Hashemite regime </p><p>and continue today to serve in disproportionately large </p><p>percentages in the armed forces and security services.  They </p><p>also make up one of the Public Security Directorate (PSD)\'s </p><p>best-known units, the Badia, or desert, police.  The </p><p>semi-nomadic tribes--traditionally herders--make up roughly </p><p>13-15 percent of the population and include the single </p><p>largest tribe in Jordan, the Bani Hassan, who number over </p><p>200,000. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The non-nomadic tribes account for much of the rest of </p><p>the East Bank population and include such notable Jordanian </p><p>families as the Majalis and the Tarawnehs from Kerak, both of </p><p>whom have produced a number of Jordanian leaders and </p><p>Hashemite advisors.  These families, whose names are </p><p>instantly recognizable in Jordan, are very influential </p><p>elements of Jordanian political and economic life. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>THE HASHEMITE DEPENDENCE ON THE TRIBES </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) There has long been a symbiotic relationship between </p><p>the Hashemite rulers in Jordan and the East Bank tribes. </p><p>Jordan\'s tribes figured prominently in the Arab revolt </p><p>against the Ottoman empire, led by King Abdullah I\'s father. </p><p>Until recently, the tribes were unquestionably the </p><p>Hashemites\' most significant source of political power.  As </p><p>such, the Hashemites have cultivated personal relationships </p><p>with the tribes, while carefully maintaining the balance of </p><p>power between each.  Regular contact with the tribes became a </p><p>mainstay of Hashemite rule, beginning with King Abdullah I, </p><p>who received tribal representatives at his al-Ma\'wa palace </p><p>every Friday during his reign.  The Hashemites also often </p><p>bestowed generous cash payments on the tribes to ensure their </p><p>loyalty. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) King Hussein continued the tradition of nurturing the </p><p>relationship with the tribes.  He often camped with the </p><p>Bedouins and frequently visited individual tribes for mensaf </p><p>(the traditional East Bank Jordanian meal).  On many </p><p>occasions, he brought his sons, including King Abdullah and </p><p>Crown Prince Hamza, to instill in them the importance of </p><p>tribal ties.  At the same time, King Hussein ably used </p><p>historic tribal rivalries to check the power of individual </p><p>tribes, thus ensuring that no tribal sheikh could ever rival </p><p>his base of power. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The tribes in turn benefited from their exclusive </p><p>relationship with the Hashemites.  While West Bank </p><p>Palestinians are a majority of the population in Jordan, </p><p>political institutions favor members of the East Bank tribes. </p><p> While some ministerial positions traditionally are reserved </p><p>for Christians and others, Muslim East Bankers occupy almost </p><p>all the upper ranks of the Jordanian Armed Forces, the </p><p>General Intelligence Directorate, and the PSD, (their </p><p>children are favored in university admissions at Jordan\'s </p><p>competitive public universities); and they dominate almost </p><p>every level of Jordan\'s bureaucracy. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>KING ABDULLAH AND THE TRIBES </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) When King Abdullah II ascended to the throne, he </p><p>lacked his father\'s touch with the tribes and initially spent </p><p>little effort in shoring up their support. He also ascended </p><p>to a cash-strapped throne and, as some contacts have </p><p>insinuated, he was unable to continue with the generous </p><p>payments to the tribes.  In 2000, just over a year into the </p><p>King\'s reign, a tribal leader told us that the King had made </p><p>a poor first impression on the tribes; "...his father left </p><p>him a large political inheritance with the tribes, but he is </p><p>spending it quickly."  In 2001, during visits with the </p><p>Howeitat and the Bani Hassan, tribal members voiced support </p><p>for the Hashemites (and King Hussein), but rarely singled out </p><p>the King for praise.  To avoid direct criticism of the King, </p><p>tribal members criticized the King\'s advisors, blaming them </p><p>for what they perceived as the King\'s disappointing </p><p>performance. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) That said, support for the Hashemites never really </p><p>wavered.  Tribal contacts are quick to stress their loyalty </p><p>to the regime.  One Howeitat told Poloff that he and his </p><p>tribe would support the Hashemites down to Princess Salma </p><p>(King Abdullah\'s youngest child).  On a recent visit to the </p><p>Shihab tribe, one tribal member told the Ambassador that it </p><p>didn\'t matter if "we go to sleep hungry, it is fine with us" </p><p>as long as the King was okay. </p><p>9. (C)  Over the past two years, according to Palace </p><p>contacts, King Abdullah moved to strengthen his ties with his </p><p>tribal base.  The King has done this by shuffling the Palace </p><p>offices responsible for tribal relations, increasing </p><p>(somewhat) his personal contact with key tribal leaders, </p><p>greater attention to small tribal requests, and job-creation </p><p>programs in tribal areas (such as busing employees from </p><p>tribally-dominated areas such as Shobak, Kerak, and Tafileh </p><p>to QIZ factories). </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) These efforts have paid some dividends.  During one </p><p>outing last summer, the King met with almost 2,000 tribal </p><p>leaders.  In addition to pursuing closer contacts with the </p><p>tribes, he initiated his social and economic development </p><p>program, which targets the rural (more undeveloped) and </p><p>heavily tribal areas.  Sheikh Nawaf Eiton, a leader of the </p><p>Bani Hassan tribe, had sharply criticized those around the </p><p>King during a 2001 visit with Poloff.  By the Summer of 2002, </p><p>however, Sheikh Eiton was effusive about the King, telling </p><p>one Poloff that the King had begun to reach out to the "real" </p><p>tribal leaders (whom Eiton described as those leaders who </p><p>have a genuine or moral authority with the tribe.) </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Prior to the build-up to the Iraqi situation, King </p><p>Abdullah was also winning praise for his international </p><p>political sensibilities.  Politically savvy tribal members </p><p>have commented on the King\'s ability to shore up regional </p><p>alliances, secure economic and military assistance, and </p><p>become a player in the international arena.  Other tribal </p><p>leaders have also positively remarked on the influence that </p><p>King Abdullah has built in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CHALLENGES </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) King Abdullah will likely weather any tribal </p><p>discontent stemming from a U.S. offensive against Iraq, </p><p>though not without some difficulties.  Some Jordanian tribes </p><p>have  links to Iraq and/or extensive business ties.  However, </p><p>the desire for the stability and patronage offered by the </p><p>Hashemites will likely overcome any pro-Iraqi sentiment. </p><p>Looking into the future, however, the King will be challenged </p><p>to move forward with the political and economic progress he </p><p>envisions for Jordan while maintaining the support and </p><p>loyalty of the East Bank tribes, who may be displaced by this </p><p>progress. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) As the King attempts to move Jordan forward, his </p><p>political and economic reform efforts threaten to undermine </p><p>the patron-client relationship the tribes have traditionally </p><p>enjoyed.  Since King Hussein\'s "one man, one vote" electoral </p><p>reform in 1993, tribes have enjoyed increased proportional </p><p>representation in Parliament.  King Abdullah reaffirmed this </p><p>policy when he approved of a new electoral law in July, 2001, </p><p>which increased the number of seats in Parliament but did not </p><p>redistribute them.  Whereas one representative in the second </p><p>district of Amman represents roughly 500,000 people, one </p><p>representative in Ma\'an represents close to 50,000.  (The </p><p>Ma\'an governorate houses the Howeitat--one of the King\'s most </p><p>loyal tribes--although the non-Howeitat town of Ma\'an has </p><p>proved more troublesome to the Hashemites in the last decade. </p><p> See Ref.)  There has been intense pressure from those </p><p>underrepresented groups--namely West Bank-origin </p><p>Palestinians--to democratize the electoral system.  Thus far </p><p>the King has resisted the pressure to do so because it would </p><p>severely undercut the representation of the tribes--his most </p><p>loyal constituent--in Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Political reform has affected the tribes on the local </p><p>level.  Since the early 1990s, the Kingdom has moved to </p><p>decrease the number of municipal governments.  In 1991, there </p><p>were over 700 municipalities in Jordan, each with their own </p><p>government and employing thousands of people.  To increase </p><p>the solvency of the municipal governments (many of which were </p><p>bankrupt), King Abdullah moved in 2001 to again reduce the </p><p>328 municipalities to less than 100.  Tribal leaders </p><p>complained that this undermined their ability to secure </p><p>employment (and other patronage) for their members.  To </p><p>counter criticism from the tribes, the King ensured that </p><p>tribes would remain at the helm of municipal governments by </p><p>changing the law to allow the central government to appoint </p><p>mayors instead of electing them. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The King is also under domestic and international </p><p>pressure to decrease the prevalence of the patronage system </p><p>(wasta), the power base of the East Bank tribes.  As King </p><p>Abdullah moves (slowly) towards a merit-based system, the </p><p>tribes have the most to lose. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) The loyalty offered by the East Bank tribes may be </p><p>the most important component of Hashemite rule.  King </p><p>Abdullah in the future will have to engage in a very </p><p>important balancing act: moving forward in reforming </p><p>political and economic systems, which the majority of the </p><p>population demand, while maintaining the support of his most </p><p>important pillar, which benefits most from the status quo. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
