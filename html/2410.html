<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 08 ABUJA 000189 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: 2001 INCSR CHAPTER ON NIGERIA </p><p> </p><p>REF: 01 STATE 203719 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The following is post,s INCSR submission. </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nigeria </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Nigeria remains a hub of narcotics trafficking and money </p><p>laundering activity. Nigerian organized criminal groups </p><p>dominate the African drug trade, and transport narcotics to </p><p>markets in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some </p><p>of these criminal organizations  are engaged in Advance-Fee </p><p>Fraud, commonly referred to as "419 Fraud8 and other forms </p><p>of defrauding U.S. citizens and businesses.   Years of </p><p>military rule and an associated economic decline contributed </p><p>significantly to the expansion of drug-trafficking and </p><p>criminality in Nigeria. The resulting severe unemployment and </p><p>widespread corruption provided both an incentive and a </p><p>mechanism for Nigerian criminal groups to capitalize on </p><p>Nigeria\'s central location along the major drug routes and </p><p>access global narcotics markets. Southeast and Southwest </p><p>Asian heroin smuggled via Nigeria accounts for a significant </p><p>portion of the heroin imported into the United States. </p><p>Nigerian criminal elements operating in South America </p><p>transship cocaine through Nigeria on to Europe, Asia, and </p><p>Africa, mainly South Africa. Nigerian-grown marijuana is </p><p>exported to neighboring West African countries and to Europe, </p><p>but not in significant quantities to the U.S.  Aside from </p><p>marijuana, Nigeria does not produce any of the drugs that are </p><p>trafficked by its nationals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. During the past year, President Obasanjo,s public </p><p>denunciation of this criminal activity has been matched by a </p><p>number of steps he has taken to tackle drug-trafficking, </p><p>money-laundering and other organized criminal activities </p><p>while he seeks to improve the image of Nigeria abroad. </p><p>Funding of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) </p><p>--Nigeria,s sole drug control agency -- increased 200 </p><p>percent while the NDLEA,s dynamic leadership instituted a </p><p>number of internal reforms that have improved the </p><p>professionalism of the 3,500 men and women in the NDLEA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Nigeria,s effort to strengthen its commitment to drug </p><p>control and the fight against organized crime suffered a </p><p>tragic setback when Chief Bola Ige, the Attorney General and </p><p>Minister of Justice, was assassinated on December 23.  Chief </p><p>Ige, Nigeria,s top law enforcement official and the official </p><p>responsible for the NDLEA,s operations, was the catalyst </p><p>behind many of the new anti-drug and anti-crime initiatives </p><p>in the past year.  President Obasanjo has pledged to find and </p><p>prosecute those behind the assassination and to sustain the </p><p>reforms started by the late Attorney General. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. A campaign to root out corruption started shortly after </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s inauguration in May 1999 has this year </p><p>been sustained and strengthened.  In late 2001, the </p><p>Anti-Corruption Commission hired 93 investigators, </p><p>prosecutors and administrators ) its first batch of </p><p>dedicated personnel.  The Obasanjo Administration supports </p><p>the domestically controversial 1990 NDLEA Act Number 33. This </p><p>law dictates that Nigerians convicted of drug offenses abroad </p><p>will be arrested upon their deportation back to Nigeria, and, </p><p>if convicted, will be liable for a minimum of 5 years </p><p>additional imprisonment for harming the reputation of </p><p>Nigeria. But corruption embedded over 16 years of continuous </p><p>military rule continues to be a problem for an Obasanjo </p><p>Administration committed to rooting it out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Over the years, Nigerian law enforcement agencies have had </p><p>sporadic success in combating the various elements of the </p><p>drug trade. In 2001, however, the Obasanjo government took a </p><p>number of steps to strengthen the capacity of these agencies </p><p>to deal with organized crime.  Legislation was introduced </p><p>into the National Assembly to improve the existing 1995 Money </p><p>Laundering Act that only criminalizes money laundering </p><p>related to drug trafficking.  Following the June 2001 </p><p>designation of Nigeria by the Financial Action Task Force </p><p>(FATF) as a &Non-Cooperative Country or Territory,8 the </p><p>Nigerian Government acted quickly to respond to the FATF by </p><p>designing a new Anti-Terrorism, Economic and Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission that will serve as a strong centralized authority </p><p>to coordinate anti-money laundering efforts, specifically to </p><p>combat the financial activities of narcotics traffickers. </p><p>Legislation creating this new commission has been drafted and </p><p>is expected to be submitted and approved by the National </p><p>Assembly within the first quarter of 2002.  There have been </p><p>few arrests and no convictions under the existing Money </p><p>Laundering Decree.  In addition, asset forfeiture has not </p><p>been a successful deterrent against money laundering or drug </p><p>trafficking activities. Interdiction and enforcement efforts </p><p>are complicated by an absence of inter-agency cooperation and </p><p>a serious lack of resources. Years of neglect by successive </p><p>military regimes left the law enforcement community </p><p>demoralized and ill-equipped to deal with sophisticated, </p><p>international criminal networks. This problem is compounded </p><p>by pervasive corruption throughout all levels of government. </p><p>There have been a few arrests of major traffickers; however, </p><p>it can take years for a case to actually come to trial and no </p><p>mechanism exists to track cases. Cases are often lost within </p><p>Nigeria\'s judicial system. Nigeria did take a significant </p><p>step in November 2000 by transferring into U.S. custody four </p><p>fugitives wanted on serious narcotics and narcotics-related </p><p>charges, including two who are on the President,s List of </p><p>Significant Foreign Narcotics Traffickers under the Foreign </p><p>Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. Nigeria is a party to the </p><p>1988 UN Drug Convention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>II. Status of Country </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Nigeria produces no precursor chemicals or drugs that have </p><p>a significant effect on the United States. However, Nigeria </p><p>remains a major drug-trafficking transit country and Nigerian </p><p>criminal elements operate global networks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The law enforcement agency with sole  responsibility for </p><p>combating narcotics trafficking and drug abuse is the </p><p>National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). The NDLEA was </p><p>established in 1989, and works alongside Nigerian Customs, </p><p>the State Security Service, the National Agency for Food and </p><p>Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), the National </p><p>Police, and the Nigerian Immigration Service at the various </p><p>ports of entry. NDLEA\'s most successful interdictions have </p><p>taken place at Nigeria,s international airports.  The agency </p><p>has successfully apprehended individual drug couriers </p><p>transiting these airports and some of the drug traffickers </p><p>sponsoring these couriers.  An improved interdiction effort </p><p>at the Lagos international airport during 2001 has forced </p><p>smugglers to change tactics and ship contraband via Nigeria\'s </p><p>five major seaports or across its porous land borders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. In late 2001, the NDLEA carried out an unprecedented </p><p>seizure of 60 kilograms of cocaine at the Lagos seaport of </p><p>Tin Can Island.  Following this seizure, the President issued </p><p>an executive decree granting the NDLEA full operational </p><p>access to all of Nigeria,s international sea ports.   This </p><p>move, long called for by the U.S. Government, is expected to </p><p>greatly boost the NDLEA,s interdiction success. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. As specialists in moving narcotics and other contraband, </p><p>Nigerian criminal organizations are heavily involved in </p><p>corollary criminal activities such as document fabrication, </p><p>illegal immigration, and financial fraud. Their ties to </p><p>criminals in the United States, Europe, South America, Asia </p><p>and South Africa are well documented. Nigerian poly-crime </p><p>organizations exact significant financial and societal costs, </p><p>especially among West African nations with limited resources </p><p>for countering these organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>III. Country Actions Against Drugs in 2001 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Policy Initiatives. In 2001 the democratically elected </p><p>Obasanjo Administration  introduced a number of new </p><p>legislative and executive initiatives to combat narcotics </p><p>trafficking and organized crime.  These include:  drafting </p><p>new money laundering legislation; drafting of legislation to </p><p>create an &Anti-Terrorism, Economic and Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission8 to coordinate government-wide efforts against </p><p>money laundering and financial crimes; granting expanded </p><p>authority to the NDLEA to operate in the five major </p><p>international seaports of Nigeria and the formation of an </p><p>inter-agency anti-fraud committee to improve enforcement </p><p>efforts against financial fraud.  The draft bill to create an </p><p>Anti-Terrorism, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission </p><p>shows the Government,s commitment to meeting its </p><p>international obligations, particularly the criteria of the </p><p>FATF.  Nigeria\'s counter-narcotics policy is based on the </p><p>National Drug Control Master Plan (NDCMP), in place since </p><p>1998. This plan assigns responsibilities to various </p><p>government ministries and agencies as well as NGOs and other </p><p>interest groups. The master plan also outlines basic resource </p><p>requirements and time-frames for the completion of </p><p>objectives. Many of these goals have not yet been met. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Both chambers in the National Assembly have Narcotics </p><p>Affairs Committees, which monitor the performance of the </p><p>NDLEA and implementation of Nigeria\'s counter-narcotics </p><p>strategy. While past frequent leadership changes at the NDLEA </p><p>have  impaired the agency\'s interdiction activities, the </p><p>tenure since October 2000 of the current NDLEA Chairman, </p><p>Alhaji Bello Lafiaji has given the agency new life and much </p><p>greater direction.  Chairman Lafiaji has declared an all-out </p><p>offensive against drug trafficking and has instituted a </p><p>number of internal reforms to improve the professionalism of </p><p>NDLEA staff, including the retiring of officials suspected of </p><p>corruption and improving training and benefits for NDLEA </p><p>personnel.  Chairman Lafiaji also has called for the </p><p>harmonization of Nigeria\'s narcotics legislation and has </p><p>sought increased international assistance for his agency. The </p><p>NDLEA has also embarked upon a publicity campaign to combat </p><p>narcotics trafficking and drug abuse by staging various </p><p>contraband destruction events around the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Accomplishments.  Nigeria,s drug enforcement efforts </p><p>improved substantially in 2001.  With INL assistance, the </p><p>NDLEA launched a more aggressive drug interdiction campaign </p><p>at the Lagos international airport ) long known as a major </p><p>gateway for U.S.- and Europe-bound narcotics.   This effort </p><p>coincided with the resumption of direct (nonstop) flights </p><p>from Lagos to the U.S. in February, after a hiatus of eight </p><p>years.   The report of only one seizure made by U.S. </p><p>authorities at the port of entry of the flight (New York,s </p><p>JFK airport) is evidence of greatly improved screening by the </p><p>NDLEA in Lagos. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. The Nigerian Government also improved its record of </p><p>drug-related prosecutions.  Using special drug courts, a more </p><p>energetic effort by the NDLEA to prosecute drug traffickers </p><p>efficiently and successfully produced over 2,000 convictions </p><p>in calendar year 2001.   In a notable November 2001 case, the </p><p>NDLEA froze a bank account of 1.6 million naira that belongs </p><p>to a suspected drug-trafficker and money-launderer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. The Government of Nigeria also pledged to design a </p><p>mechanism to process U.S. extradition requests expeditiously </p><p>while observing due process under Nigerian law and in </p><p>accordance with the Nigerian constitution.  This mechanism </p><p>will include the creation of an exclusive extradition team of </p><p>public prosecutors and the designation of a special court and </p><p>a High Court judge dedicated to extradition cases.  While </p><p>extradition requests were formerly heard in any court, </p><p>including lower magistrates, courts, the Government has now </p><p>centralized the handling of all U.S. extradition requests in </p><p>the Federal High Court of Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. At the Government of Nigeria,s initiative, a high level </p><p>U.S.-Nigeria law enforcement dialogue was initiated in 2001. </p><p>The first meeting of this semi-annual forum, the Bilateral </p><p>Law Enforcement Committee, took place on November 9 in </p><p>Washington D.C. and covered the full range of U.S. and </p><p>Nigerian law enforcement interests: drug control; financial </p><p>fraud; trafficking in persons; corruption; immigration </p><p>crimes; police reform; extradition and money-laundering.  The </p><p>dialogue has already led to commitments by the Government of </p><p>Nigeria to take significant steps towards mutually agreed </p><p>goals by March 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Law Enforcement Efforts.  Nigerian counter-narcotics </p><p>efforts primarily focus on the interdiction of couriers </p><p>transiting Nigeria\'s air- and sea ports as well as a public </p><p>campaign focused on destroying plots of cultivated marijuana </p><p>throughout the country.  Improved drug interdiction efforts </p><p>at the Lagos airport and sea ports led to a 40 percent </p><p>increase in drug seizures over 2000.  43 kilograms of heroin </p><p>and 98 kilograms of cocaine were seized during 2001.  This </p><p>included a record seizure of 60 kilograms of cocaine at the </p><p>Lagos sea port of Tin Can Island.   The number of drug </p><p>related arrests increased to 3,592 and 2,041 drug convictions </p><p>were handed down during the last year.   Some major </p><p>narcotics-smugglers and their networks continue to elude </p><p>arrest and prosecution, even though the NDLEA recently began </p><p>an intensified effort to investigate major international drug </p><p>traffickers operating in Nigeria, in cooperation with the </p><p>DEA.  Attempts by NDLEA to arrest and prosecute major </p><p>traffickers and their associates often fail in Nigeria\'s weak </p><p>judicial system, which is subject to intimidation and </p><p>corruption. Asset seizures from narcotics-traffickers and </p><p>money-launderers, while permitted under Nigerian law, have </p><p>never systematically been utilized as an enforcement tool, </p><p>but some convicted traffickers have had their assets </p><p>forfeited over the years. However, the number of traffickers </p><p>so far penalized remains small. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. Corruption. Corruption is a pervasive problem in Nigerian </p><p>society. Estimated unemployment is over 25 percent. Civil </p><p>servants, salaries are low. In addition, salaries are </p><p>frequently months in arrears, compounding the corruption </p><p>problem. After its inauguration, the Obasanjo Administration </p><p>embarked on a public anti-corruption campaign. Legislation </p><p>was enacted and an Anti-Corruption Commission was formed. </p><p>This commission began prosecution of several minor officials </p><p>on corruption charges, and has initiated investigations into </p><p>allegations of high-level corruption have been launched.  The </p><p>commission also has hired its first dedicated staff of </p><p>prosecutors, investigators and administrators.  The U.S. </p><p>Government is providing the Commission with training and </p><p>technical assistance for its new staff.  A commission also </p><p>was established to review government contracts awarded by </p><p>past Administrations.  The Obasanjo Administration, however, </p><p>has made limited progress  towards transparency and openness </p><p>in its contracting and decision-making process.  A number of </p><p>criminal cases, launched by the Anti-Corruption Commission </p><p>against public officials accused of bribe-taking, are moving </p><p>forward and are expected to conclude early in 2002, although </p><p>an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the Commission,s </p><p>constitutionality has delayed these cases.   Meanwhile, </p><p>corruption remains a significant obstacle to </p><p>counter-narcotics efforts, especially in the judicial </p><p>process. While the NDLEA has attempted to purge its ranks of </p><p>officers suspected of corrupt practices, a fear of corruption </p><p>hampers inter-agency cooperation as agencies are often </p><p>distrustful and unwilling to share information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. Agreements and Treaties. Nigeria is a party to the 1988 </p><p>UN Drug Convention, the 1961 UN Single Convention and its </p><p>1972 Protocol,  the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic </p><p>Substances; and the 2000 UN Convention on Transnational </p><p>Organized Crime. The 1931 U.S.-UK Extradition Treaty, which </p><p>was made applicable to Nigeria in 1935, is the legal basis </p><p>for pending U.S. extradition requests.  Nigeria is a party to </p><p>the World Customs Organization,s Nairobi Convention, Annex </p><p>on Assistance in Narcotics Cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. Cultivation and Production. Cannabis is the only illicit </p><p>drug produced in any significant quantity in Nigeria. The </p><p>drug is produced in all 36 states. Major cultivation takes </p><p>place in central and northern Nigeria and in Delta and Ondo </p><p>states in the south. Marijuana, or "Indian Hemp" as it is </p><p>locally known, is sold in Nigeria and exported throughout </p><p>West Africa and into Europe. To date, there is no evidence of </p><p>significant marijuana imports from Nigeria into the United </p><p>States. The NDLEA has been engaged in an active eradication </p><p>campaign. Through November  2001, the NDLEA claimed cannabis </p><p>seizures in excess of 290 metric tons and eradication of </p><p>cannabis plants in the field in excess of 270 hectares. In </p><p>August 2001, the NLDEA invited dignitaries and the diplomatic </p><p>corps  to a narcotics destruction ceremony in Lagos to </p><p>highlight the agency,s seizures of narcotics throughout the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. Drug Flow/Transit. Nigeria is a major staging point for </p><p>Southeast and Southwest Asian heroin smuggled to Europe and </p><p>the United States and for South American cocaine transported </p><p>to Europe. While Nigeria remains Africa\'s drug transit hub, </p><p>there are indications that the preferred methods of </p><p>trans-shipment have changed. Improvement of the overall </p><p>security posture at Murtala Mohammed International Airport </p><p>has forced drug traffickers to ship by sea from Nigerian </p><p>seaports, concealing large quantities of contraband in </p><p>shipping containers, or use other West African airport with </p><p>laxer security controls. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. Demand Reduction. Local production and use of marijuana </p><p>have been a problem in Nigeria for some time; however, </p><p>according to the NDLEA and NGOs, the abuse of harder drugs </p><p>(e.g., cocaine, heroin) is on the rise. Heroin and cocaine </p><p>are readily available in many of Nigeria\'s larger cities. Law </p><p>enforcement officials admit that Nigeria remains a major </p><p>narcotics trans-shipment point, but some officials deny that </p><p>domestic drug abuse is on the rise. U.S. officials and </p><p>training instructors find that many Nigerian officials do not </p><p>understand that by serving as a transit point, Nigeria may </p><p>itself begin to suffer significant drug abuse problems. The </p><p>NDLEA continues to expand its anti-drug clubs at Nigerian </p><p>universities and distribute anti-drug literature. The NDLEA </p><p>also has instituted a teacher,s  manual for primary and </p><p>secondary schools, which  offers guidance on teaching </p><p>students about drug abuse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IV. U.S. Policy Initiatives and Programs </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. Policy Initiatives. U.S.-Nigerian counter-narcotics </p><p>cooperation focuses on interdiction efforts at major </p><p>international entry points and on professionalizing the NDLEA </p><p>and other law enforcement agencies. U.S. training and </p><p>material assistance have continued, with the NDLEA as the </p><p>primary target.  The U.S. DEA office deals with a small group </p><p>of NDLEA representatives to lessen the chance of compromise </p><p>by corrupt individuals. USG working-level representatives </p><p>enjoy good access to their counterparts and there is an </p><p>evident desire on both sides to strengthen these </p><p>relationships. The new NDLEA Chairman appears committed to </p><p>meeting agency goals and improving the morale of NDLEA </p><p>officers.  Bilateral discussions during the last year on the </p><p>need to reform Nigeria,s Police have presaged the planned </p><p>start in 2002 of a USG police reform program.   The Nigerian </p><p>Government has reviewed plans for reform and U.S. assistance </p><p>agencies have prepared their own suggestions for ways to </p><p>proceed, however, the task will be formidable as the police </p><p>lack so much in the way of equipment, and their morale has </p><p>suffered over the years as the situation deteriorated. For </p><p>example, salaries are low and frequently paid months late. </p><p>23. Bilateral Accomplishments.   In 2001, at the request of </p><p>the GON, a U.S.-Nigeria Bilateral Law Enforcement Committee </p><p>was created to advance mutual drug and crime control issues. </p><p>Co-chaired by Nigeria,s Attorney General and the State </p><p>Department,s Assistant Secretary for International Narcotics </p><p>and Law Enforcement Affairs, the group met for the first time </p><p>in November 2001 in Washington.  This meeting produced a </p><p>joint declaration containing Government of Nigeria pledges </p><p>to:  a) introduce new money laundering legislation; b) begin </p><p>investigation of at least one major drug trafficker in </p><p>cooperation with DEA; c) draft and introduce to the National </p><p>Assembly new legislation allowing for the civil forfeiture of </p><p>assets derived from organized crime or drug-trafficking; d) </p><p>commence extradition proceedings of individuals wanted for </p><p>prosecution by the U.S. Government; and e) boost resources </p><p>for the new Anti-Corruption Commission.  Meanwhile, The U.S. </p><p>DEA office in Nigeria continues to work with the NDLEA on </p><p>expanding their relationship.   New INL assistance to the </p><p>NDLEA allowed for a stronger interdiction posture at the </p><p>Lagos international airport ) Nigeria,s largest  drug </p><p>transit point ) forcing many traffickers to re-route drug </p><p>shipments through neighboring countries.   INL assistance has </p><p>also been provided to the Nigerian Police Force to improve </p><p>investigations and enforcement operations against criminal </p><p>organizations involved in advance fee or &4198 fraud, which </p><p>largely targets American citizens and businesses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. The Road Ahead. The U.S.-Nigerian relationship has </p><p>improved significantly with the reintroduction of democratic </p><p>government in Nigeria.  During the past year President </p><p>Obasanjo demonstrated his commitment to the international </p><p>drug fight by increasing the NDLEA,s budget by 200 percent </p><p>and giving this agency long-awaited operational access to </p><p>Nigeria,s sea ports. Nevertheless, much remains to be done </p><p>in the area of drug control and the Federal Government needs </p><p>to address key weaknesses, including the processing of U.S. </p><p>extradition requests and the local prosecution of major drug </p><p>traffickers.  As noted elsewhere in this report, the </p><p>narcotics and crime problems in Nigeria are deeply rooted in </p><p>Nigeria\'s present governmental system, and in Nigerian </p><p>society.  It will require strong political will and continued </p><p>international assistance for any Nigerian government to </p><p>confront these difficult issues and bring about meaningful </p><p>change. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. The U.S. government is working to aid Nigeria in its </p><p>counter-narcotics efforts. One area of prime concern is the </p><p>judiciary. Law enforcement efforts are often stymied by the </p><p>slow pace of the judicial system, which can be attributed to </p><p>both intimidation and corruption of the judiciary by criminal </p><p>organizations. The U.S. Agency for International Development </p><p>has implemented a "Rule of Law" program with the Nigerian </p><p>government to help strengthen and professionalize the </p><p>judiciary.  Through the framework of the new Bilateral Law </p><p>Enforcement Committee, the Nigerian Government has committed </p><p>itself to the establishment of  a reliable extradition </p><p>process that will allow extradition requests to be heard </p><p>expeditiously and fairly. Many U.S. extradition requests for </p><p>narcotics-traffickers have been outstanding for years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26. The U.S. Government is also concerned about fundamental </p><p>problems with the Nigerian Police Force and other law </p><p>enforcement agencies.   While President Obasanjo and his </p><p>advisors are aware of the need to modernize the Nigerian </p><p>Police as a key pillar of democratic consolidation, little </p><p>has been done to address key issues such as low salaries for </p><p>police and other law enforcement  personnel.  Salary arrears </p><p>also remain a problem.  The Government of Nigeria needs to </p><p>demonstrate a commitment of its own resources to the fight </p><p>against narcotics trafficking and transnational crime in </p><p>order to strengthen its case for additional foreign donor </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27. The U.S. government provided training for NDLEA personnel </p><p>on general investigative techniques and sent two NDLEA </p><p>officers responsible for drug interdiction at the Lagos </p><p>international airport to a specialized training course in the </p><p>United States.  Since narcotics-trafficking and financial </p><p>crimes are closely linked, the Government of Nigeria must </p><p>also strengthen and utilize its asset forfeiture legislation, </p><p>already in place. In addition, Nigeria must work to bring its </p><p>money-laundering laws into compliance with the FATF 40 </p><p>recommendations and work to regulate its banking industry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>28. The U.S. government will continue to actively engage </p><p>Nigeria on the issue of counter-narcotics and money </p><p>laundering. There have been incremental successes, but </p><p>long-term progress will only come about through the </p><p>continuation of serious dialogue and cooperation, and a </p><p>willingness on the part of Nigeria\'s government to confront </p><p>difficult issues. The underlying institutional and societal </p><p>factors that contribute to narcotics-trafficking and </p><p>money-laundering activities in Nigeria are deep-seated and </p><p>require comprehensive, long-term solutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============================================= === </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Money Laundering Chapter: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>29. Nigeria (Primary). The Federal Republic of Nigeria is a </p><p>hub of money laundering and  financial crime activity, not </p><p>only for the West African sub-region but also increasingly </p><p>for the entire continent. It is the most populous country in </p><p>Africa, dominating the West African sub-region economically </p><p>and militarily. Nigeria is also Africa\'s most significant </p><p>narcotics trans-shipment point. Nigerian criminal </p><p>organizations utilize sophisticated global networks to ship </p><p>narcotics via Nigeria to markets in the United States, </p><p>Europe, and other African countries. Nigerian </p><p>money-laundering is directly linked to narcotics-trafficking </p><p>as well as corollary activities such as document, </p><p>immigration, and financial fraud. Though the execution and </p><p>coordination of these criminal activities may be taking place </p><p>increasingly outside of Nigeria, the majority of the proceeds </p><p>from these illegal activities continues to be  repatriated to </p><p>Nigeria and these funds are often used to fund subsequent </p><p>criminal operations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>30. The combination of narcotics-trafficking and money </p><p>laundering, and the fact that Nigeria has failed to </p><p>adequately address corruption among law enforcement, customs, </p><p>immigration, other government agencies, and within </p><p>society-at-large, makes it unusually difficult to have an </p><p>effective anti-money laundering program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>31. In June 2001 the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) </p><p>declared Nigeria, along with 15 other countries, a </p><p>&Non-Cooperating Country or Territory8 (NCCT) for its </p><p>failure to address FATF concerns on international money </p><p>laundering. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>32. Nigeria is notorious for the various financial schemes </p><p>that originate there. Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud, commonly </p><p>known as "Four-one-nine Scams," (419 is the reference to </p><p>fraud in Nigeria\'s criminal code) has become highly lucrative </p><p>for criminal enterprises. With the help of phone books, </p><p>business directories, and email lists, Nigerian criminal </p><p>organizations fax, mail, and email targeted businesses and </p><p>individuals around the world with enticing "get rich quick" </p><p>offers. The proposed schemes take various forms, for example, </p><p>by promising a transfer of funds "from an over-invoiced </p><p>contract" in Nigeria to a target\'s bank account. The cash in </p><p>question might be profit from a crude oil sale that a </p><p>business person "needs help in transferring out of the </p><p>country" or the disbursement of funds for a specific charity </p><p>from the estate of a recently deceased individual. Often, </p><p>these 419 letters and schemes are written on "official" </p><p>letterhead stationary. An elaborate system may be utilized to </p><p>provide bogus references. Advance Fee Fraud perpetrators may </p><p>request bank account information to gauge the targeted </p><p>victim\'s level of trust and provide the impression that a </p><p>funds transfer is imminent. All 419 Scams eventually request </p><p>payment of a fee (or fees) so that the alleged transfer of </p><p>funds can be facilitated. While actual monetary losses by US </p><p>citizens are difficult to gauge -- many victims are reluctant </p><p>to report such activity to law enforcement agencies -- </p><p>conservative estimates place such losses by American citizens </p><p>and businesses in the hundreds of millions of dollars </p><p>annually. Substantial proof exists that narcotics traffickers </p><p>have utilized 419 Scams to fund their illicit smuggling </p><p>efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>33. The current anti-money laundering law, Money Laundering </p><p>Decree No. 3 of 1995, criminalizes narcotics-based money </p><p>laundering, but is useful only if the predicate offense is </p><p>narcotics trafficking. It requires banks to identify </p><p>customers, maintain records, and report large and suspicious </p><p>transactions to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). It also </p><p>provides for the seizure and forfeiture of drug-related </p><p>assets, although forfeiture requires a conviction and thus is </p><p>seldom effectively used. Enforcement of the legislation </p><p>relies on the effective record keeping of banks, submissions </p><p>of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and account holder </p><p>identification.  Enforcement of this banking oversight </p><p>responsibility, which is shared by the CBN and the National </p><p>Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has been weak and </p><p>inconsistent because of lack of training, excessive </p><p>bureaucracy, and corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>34. The NDLEA and the CBN,s Money Laundering Surveillance </p><p>Unit (MLSU) have the power to demand, obtain, and inspect the </p><p>books and records of a financial institution to confirm </p><p>compliance with the provisions of the money laundering </p><p>decree.  Yet, the effectiveness of this authority is hindered </p><p>by weak record keeping and analysis of bank records, </p><p>including account holder identification data, filing of SARs </p><p>and information on bank management staff and affiliate </p><p>overseas banks.  These deficiencies were highlighted by the </p><p>FATF in its declaration of Nigeria as a Non-Cooperative </p><p>Country or Territory (NCCT) in June 2001.   There have been </p><p>no money laundering convictions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>35. In response to international concerns, particularly the </p><p>NCCT status given Nigeria by the FATF, the GON has taken </p><p>steps to revise the 1995 money laundering law and create a </p><p>centralized unit under the Office of the Presidency to combat </p><p>money laundering and financial crimes.   It took the </p><p>initiative in late 2001 to engage the FATF in a dialogue on </p><p>how to improve Nigeria,s money laundering control regime, </p><p>including a GON-initiated  meeting with the FATF,s Africa </p><p>and Middle East Review Group in Rome in December 2001.  The </p><p>Nigerian government has also opened up a high-level law </p><p>enforcement exchange with the U.S. Government, covering a </p><p>wide array of issues, including money laundering and </p><p>financial crimes.  This forum, the U.S.-Nigeria Law </p><p>Enforcement Committee, first met in Washington in early </p><p>November 2001.  In 1998, the GON began cooperating with the </p><p>U.S. Postal Inspection Service to identify and crack down on </p><p>fraud operations through the mail. In addition, the U.S. </p><p>Secret Service has maintained an office in the U.S. Consulate </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>General in Lagos since 1995, and in June 2000, opened a </p><p>separate office to assist in the effort to combat Advanced </p><p>Fee Fraud and other illegal operations, including U.S. dollar </p><p>counterfeiting operations. In May 1999, a decree was issued </p><p>that, according to the NDLEA, altered the burden of proof in </p><p>money laundering cases to facilitate prosecution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>36. Nigeria is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in </p><p>December 2000, signed the United Nations Convention against </p><p>Transnational Organized Crime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>37. The steps taken to address the FATF,s concerns are </p><p>encouraging.  Nigeria urgently needs to enact and implement </p><p>the draft changes to its anti-money laundering law so that it </p><p>can meet international standards and protect itself against </p><p>financial crimes and money laundering. Nigeria also needs to </p><p>demonstrate its ability to take action against corruption and </p><p>fraud. In addition, Nigeria should move quickly to create a </p><p>centralized financial intelligence unit, something that the </p><p>proposed Anti-Terrorism, Economic and Financial Crimes </p><p>Commission might incorporate, that would receive and analyze </p><p>information and cooperate with foreign counterparts in money </p><p>laundering investigations so that Nigeria can protect its </p><p>financial system from widespread abuse by criminals and </p><p>criminal organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>============================================= === </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Nigeria Statistics Table </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Category . . .
