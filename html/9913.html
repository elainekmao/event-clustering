<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 003589 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EPET, ETRD, KU, IZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) GOK CLAIMS TURKS BUYING IRAQI OIL, </p><p>UNDERCUTTING KUWAITI MOGAS SALES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ADCM John G. Moran for reason 1.6 x 6. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para. 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During their July 27 meeting, MFA U/S Khaled </p><p>Al-Jarallah told the Ambassador that Turkish tanker trucks </p><p>carrying mogas into Iraq for the CPA under a Kellogg, Brown </p><p>and Root (KBR) contract were returning to Turkey laden with </p><p>Iraqi oil supplied to Turkey at below-market price.  Jarallah </p><p>claimed the profit from the sale of this cut-rate oil was </p><p>allowing the Turks to sell mogas to KBR at a discounted rate, </p><p>undercutting competing Kuwaiti consortium Altanmia.  Jarallah </p><p>asserted this was partially to blame for the fact that KBR is </p><p>now buying a larger share of mogas from Turkey than Kuwait. </p><p>When asked, Jarallah could not say who was selling the oil to </p><p>the Turks. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In a conversation with KBR COO for Government </p><p>Operations Thomas Crum, on July 31, Poloff was informed that </p><p>KBR\'s purchase of mogas from various sources is directed "in </p><p>writing" by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Mr. Crum said </p><p>the Corps\' decision to buy more fuel from Turkey was most </p><p>likely dictated by the legal requirement for the Corps to </p><p>provide security for the transport of the fuel, which it has </p><p>found difficult in Southern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Action Request/Commment:  Ongoing security concerns in </p><p>Southern Iraq are disrupting the transport of both mogas and </p><p>LPG from Kuwait into Iraq.  If left unaddressed, the lack of </p><p>security will continue to severely restrict the flow of much </p><p>needed LPG and mogas to Iraq from Kuwait.  Given the GOK\'s </p><p>strong operational support for the liberation of Iraq and its </p><p>continuing supply of fuel for U.S. forces in Iraq at no cost </p><p>to the USG, reduction of KBR\'s purchases of LPG and mogas </p><p>from Kuwait would be an irritant in bilateral relations that </p><p>could have significant negative repercussions for U.S. </p><p>operations in Kuwait and Iraq.  We recommend that steps be </p><p>taken to prevent this by providing sufficient security for </p><p>sustained shipments of mogas and LPG from Kuwait.  Please </p><p>advise. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
