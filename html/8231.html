<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001263 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EUR/AGS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, EAID, PHUM, PTER, GM, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  GERMAN CHANCELLOR REAFFIRMS STRONG RELATIONSHIP </p><p>--         WITH VIETNAM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY.  German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder\'s </p><p>visit to Hanoi focused on economics and concluded with a </p><p>number of economics-related agreements, but also touched, </p><p>albeit briefly, on a number of other issues, including Iraq, </p><p>transnational crime, and counterterrorism.  Schroeder did </p><p>not raise the issue of human rights, but in speech at Hanoi </p><p>Polytechnic University, he discussed the need for Vietnam to </p><p>allow a freer flow of information, especially via the </p><p>Internet.  A reciprocal visit by the GVN Prime Minister in </p><p>2004 "is possible."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  (U)  Schroeder is the second German Chancellor to </p><p>visit Vietnam in recent years.  In 1995, then-Chancellor </p><p>Helmut Kohl visited.  In 2001, Wolfgang Thierse, President </p><p>of the Federal Parliament visited.  On the Vietnamese side, </p><p>Former Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited in 1993; Prime </p><p>Minister Phan Van Khai visited in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Schroeder\'s visit to Vietnam came at the end of a </p><p>swing through Asia that included stops in Indonesia, </p><p>Malaysia, and Singapore.  According to press reports, the </p><p>long-planned visit to the region was in jeopardy due to </p><p>concerns over SARS.  However, the Chancellor decided to go </p><p>forward with the trip, albeit with a reduced entourage. </p><p>During his stay in Hanoi, Schroeder met with Prime Minister </p><p>Phan Van Khai, Communist Party Secretary General Nong Duc </p><p>Manh, and President Tran Duc Luong.  Schroeder also gave a </p><p>speech at the Hanoi Polytechnic University before about 750 </p><p>students, faculty, and alumni of German institutions. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The visit, originally planned for two days, ran </p><p>from the evening of May 14 through May 15.  The reason for </p><p>the shortened visit in Vietnam was Schroeder needed to </p><p>return to Germany to meet Secretary Powell.  According to </p><p>Dr. Bui Huy Khoat, Director of the Institute of European </p><p>Studies of the National Centre for Social Sciences and </p><p>Humanities, the GVN "was relieved" that Schroeder did not </p><p>cancel his visit.  Between the SARS crisis and the meeting </p><p>with Powell in Germany, it appeared that the short visit to </p><p>Vietnam might not take place at all.  Also, fewer officials </p><p>accompanied Schroeder than originally planned due to the </p><p>SARS threat.  Based on guidance from the German health </p><p>authorities, the entourage accompanying Schroeder was </p><p>reduced from 60 to 30, mainly at the expense of the German </p><p>business community.  Prominent officials accompanying </p><p>Schroeder included Minister of Economics and Labor Wolfgang </p><p>Clement and Heinrich von Pierer, the CEO of Siemens. </p><p>According to a German embassy contact, von Pierer </p><p>participated as the head of the Asia-Pacific Committee of </p><p>the German Business Association.  (Note:  According to the </p><p>German emboff, Siemens has an MOU with the Ministry of </p><p>Industry to conduct a feasibility study for construction of </p><p>a metrorail project in and around Ho Chi Minh City. End </p><p>Note). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  According to Dr. Khoat, the relationship with </p><p>Germany as "perhaps the most important within the EU for </p><p>Vietnam."  He noted that Vietnam and Germany have strong </p><p>ties due to the large (approximately 85,000) overseas </p><p>Vietnamese population.  In addition, Vietnam has "about </p><p>40,000" German speakers, most of whom studied or worked in </p><p>the former German Democratic Republic.  According to German </p><p>embassy figures, 7,000 Vietnamese academics have graduated </p><p>from German universities and in 2002, about 1,600 Vietnamese </p><p>were enrolled in German institutions of higher learning. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>AGREEMENTS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  At the conclusion of the visit, Germany and Vietnam </p><p>signed an aid package worth about USD 76 million, according </p><p>to the German embassy.  The package includes: </p><p>--Sanitation improvement in several provincial capitals (USD </p><p>52.5); </p><p>--hospital services improvement in northwest Vietnam (USD </p><p>10.5); </p><p>--flood damage repair in the Mekong region (USD 9.3); and </p><p>--upgrading of vocational schools (USD 3.5). </p><p>In addition to these measures, the two sides also signed a </p><p>joint statement on tourism cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>STRONG ECONOMIC TIES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Germany is Vietnam\'s largest European Union (EU) </p><p>trading partner.  In 2002, Germany accounted for 28 percent </p><p>of trade between Vietnam and the EU, with two-way trade </p><p>amounting to about USD 1.9 billion, according to press </p><p>reports.  According to the German embassy, Vietnam\'s exports </p><p>to Germany are about double its imports.  Vietnam\'s most </p><p>important exports to Germany include shoes, garments, and </p><p>coffee.  The leading German exports to Vietnam include </p><p>machinery and chemicals.  Germany is also an important </p><p>source of official development assistance for Vietnam and </p><p>its third largest bilateral donor.  In 2002, Germany </p><p>provided about USD 36 million of loans and grants to </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>BUSINESS COMMUNITY\'S VIEWS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Economics and Labor Minister Clement met with </p><p>representatives of the German business community (most of </p><p>whom traveled up from Ho Chi Minh City) for a breakfast </p><p>meeting on May 15.  According to the German emboff, the </p><p>businessmen raised "normal complaints" such as the lack of </p><p>transparency and the frustrations of dealing with the GVN </p><p>economic bureaucracy.  More importantly, they appeared </p><p>"somewhat frustrated" over what they perceive as having to </p><p>operate at a disadvantage since implementation of the U.S. - </p><p>Vietnam bilateral trade agreement in December 2001. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  According to our emboff contact, one of the </p><p>businessmen told Clement that since two-way trade with </p><p>Germany only increased by about three percent in 2002, </p><p>German business people were "disadvantaged" compared to </p><p>their US counterparts.  In a meeting with Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister (and former Trade Minister) Vu Khoan, Clement </p><p>raised this issue and received assurances from Vu Khoan that </p><p>Germany, as well as other European Union countries, "will be </p><p>treated equitably."  Clement also told his hosts that </p><p>Germany will continue to support Vietnam\'s accession to WTO, </p><p>according to the German emboff. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ON THE POLITICAL FRONT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  According to Dr. Khoat, Vietnam and Germany have </p><p>no "serious bilateral political issues."  During the </p><p>meetings, areas such as Iraq, counterterrorism, and </p><p>transnational crime were "touched upon."  The German emboff </p><p>said that Germany and Vietnam are "rather close" on Iraq and </p><p>counterterrorism to the extent that both countries share the </p><p>view that the United Nations should play a "key role." </p><p>Regarding crime, the leaders briefly discussed mutual </p><p>concerns regarding transnational crime and its connection to </p><p>the Vietnamese community in Germany, but the discussions </p><p>were "not substantive," according to our German embassy </p><p>contact.  Schroeder, however, did receive assurances from </p><p>his hosts that Vietnam would "continue to cooperate" with </p><p>German law enforcement authorities. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  Regarding human rights, Schroeder did not </p><p>specifically raise the issue with his hosts; however, he did </p><p>present Prime Minister Khai the EU\'s list of 24 prisoners of </p><p>concern.  According to our emboff contact, the Prime </p><p>Minister accepted the list without comment.  At a speech at </p><p>the Hanoi Polytechnic University, Schroeder did speak about </p><p>the need for Vietnam to have a "freer information flow, </p><p>particularly via the Internet."  According to the German </p><p>emboff, the event was "a highlight" of the visit because it </p><p>was the type of situation where Schroeder is "most </p><p>comfortable."  When Schroeder formally handed over five new </p><p>scholarships to the Polytechnic\'s rector, Schroeder received </p><p>a big laugh when he told the audience, "It is better to come </p><p>as an uncle bringing gifts than as an aunt who only plays </p><p>the piano." </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>WHAT\'S NEXT </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  Separately, Dr. Khoat and the German emboff said </p><p>that further high-level visits are unlikely this year. </p><p>However, Dr. Khoat predicted that the GVN Prime Minister </p><p>"might visit" sometime in 2004. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
