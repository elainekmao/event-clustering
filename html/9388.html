<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ROME 003214 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EU, IS, IT, KPAL, PREL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: MID-EAST PEACE PROCESS: WHAT TO EXPECT OF ITALY AS </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE EU ON THE MEPP </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ROME 2766 </p><p> </p><p>     B. ROME 2646 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASO </p><p>NS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Italy has identified the MidEast Peace </p><p>Process as among its top foreign policy priorities during its </p><p>EU Presidency (July-December 2003).  PM Berlusconi has </p><p>consciously upgraded Italy\'s relations with Israel to balance </p><p>its traditional close ties to the Palestinians and make the </p><p>GOI better able to collaborate closely with the USG within </p><p>the Quartet.  At the same time, it is conscious that EU </p><p>decision-making process, and continued Israeli distrust of </p><p>the EU, will limit its ability to innovate -- we should not </p><p>expect the Italians to single-handedly reverse the feeble EU </p><p>record in the peace process.  Italian hopes of replacing </p><p>Moratinos with an Italian candidate appear to be fading.  PM </p><p>Berlusconi and FM Frattini would like Italy to host the first </p><p>of two international peace conferences called for by the </p><p>roadmap in Sicily in Fall 2003 (Refs A-B).  Israeli, </p><p>Palestinian and Egyptian representatives in Rome share our </p><p>view that Italy\'s balanced ties at least give a basis for </p><p>hope that the Italian Presidency has an opportunity to make </p><p>the EU contribution to the peace process more visible and </p><p>productive.    End summary. </p><p> </p><p>BALANCING TIES WITH ISRAEL AND PALESTINE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Since taking office two years ago, Berlusconi has </p><p>consciously sought to improve Italy\'s ties with Israel. </p><p>Besides hosting PM Sharon early in their respective tenures, </p><p>Berlusconi has gone out of his way to keep in phone touch </p><p>with the Israeli leader.  Of greater substance, a succession </p><p>of Italian technical ministers (communications, industry, </p><p>transportation, science) have visited Israel or hosted their </p><p>Israeli counterparts and signed substantive cooperation </p><p>agreements.  This has been accompanied by a conscious shift </p><p>away from the traditional GOI support for Arafat, who </p><p>Berlusconi once courted with money from his own pocket. </p><p>Primarily at the request of President Bush, Berlusconi has </p><p>avoided direct contact with Arafat for over a year, and he </p><p>told visiting Israeli President Katsav last year that he </p><p>would "never" again see Arafat.  (This private comment was </p><p>immediately given to the press by the Israeli Embassy).  The </p><p>GOI has in turn balanced the shunning of Arafat with the </p><p>continuation of the annual subsidy that keeps afloat the </p><p>Palestinian "embassy" in Rome and -- more theoretically -- </p><p>with Berlusconi\'s proposal of a "Marshall Plan" for </p><p>Palestinian economic development.  This re-balancing is </p><p>consistent with Berlusconi\'s personal politics and with his </p><p>desire to align his foreign policy as close as possible to </p><p>President Bush\'s.  Italian diplomats have made clear that </p><p>they hope it has the added benefit of more Italian </p><p>credibility with the US - and a higher EU profile - within </p><p>the Quartet. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>WITHIN THE QUARTET, AND WITHIN THE EU </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>3. (C) The Italians are conscious -- as we should be -- that </p><p>their ability to make the EU a more effective player will be </p><p>limited by the EU\'s own history (which has led to Israel\'s </p><p>distrust of the EU) and tortured decision process.  For </p><p>example, Berlusconi was eager to make his recent visit to </p><p>Israel before assuming the EU Presidency, knowing that it </p><p>would be harder to keep his promise (made personally to </p><p>President Bush) not to see Arafat once he wore the EU </p><p>President\'s hat.  His haste to make the visit probably </p><p>contributed to the less-than-subtle way that he avoided an </p><p>Arafat meeting, which generated in turn criticism from the </p><p>French and other EU ministers that his snubbing was </p><p>inconsistent with agreed EU policy.  Though Berlusconi shot </p><p>back with a tried-and-true one-liner (De Villepin "missed a </p><p>great opportunity to keep quiet"), the fact remains that the </p><p>Italians start in a hole in terms of bringing the EU policy </p><p>around to a similar re-balancing.  FM Frattini has stated </p><p>publicly Italy\'s desire to have the EU gain a "higher </p><p>profile" within the Quartet.  If this is supported by the US </p><p>(Berlusconi may raise it in his July 20 call on the </p><p>President), it would vindicate Berlusconi\'s re-balancing </p><p>approach. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We expect the GOI will be closer to the USG, within </p><p>the Quartet, than recent EU presidencies.  In the Italian </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>view, the most positive factor in the current process is the </p><p>personal commitment of President Bush.  Berlusconi believes </p><p>that he can take advantage of a close personal relationship </p><p>with the President to support and share that commitment.  It </p><p>will do so by seeking to establish EU positions that will be </p><p>more consistent with the US view, and by coordinating closely </p><p>with the US on any diplomatic mission to the region.  It </p><p>should also be more willing than recent EU Presidents to - </p><p>rapidly - add the weight of the EU Presidency to any pressing </p><p>of either the Palestinians or Israel that the US finds </p><p>necessary.  The GOI will run the risk of being yanked back by </p><p>EU colleagues if it pushes too far (e.g., if Berlusconi were </p><p>again to snub Arafat).  They are realistic, knowing that the </p><p>real role of the Italian Presidency is limited, all the more </p><p>so as Solana appears determined to keep a tighter rein on the </p><p>process by naming as Moratinos\' successor someone more </p><p>dynamic and closer to Solana himself.  But this limitation </p><p>will not prevent the Italian representatives </p><p>(Director-General for Middle East Ricardo Sessa or Eastern </p><p>Med office director Luca Ferrari) at any Quartet meeting from </p><p>speaking out strongly.  Both have strong experience with the </p><p>region, the full confidence of the Berlusconi government, and </p><p>(especially Ferrari, the main architect of the GOI\'s </p><p>rebalancing) a pre-disposition to agree with the USG. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) More publicly, the GOI would like to make four </p><p>distinctly Italian contributions to the peace process, most </p><p>of them long shots: </p><p>-- The candidacy of Ambassador to Damascus Laura Mirachian to </p><p>replace Moratinos as special EU envoy, once hopeful, now </p><p>appears all but finished.  At best, the GOI looks forward to </p><p>working with a replacement who will be "more competent and </p><p>less jaded" than Moratinos. </p><p> </p><p>-- Second, they will continue to push the idea of a concerted </p><p>EU economic program for Palestinian development, particularly </p><p>if there is significant progress in Phase one of the roadmap. </p><p> MFA officials concede it has little chance of EU approval, </p><p>partly because of its close association with Berlusconi </p><p>himself, and partly because this is one area of foreign </p><p>assistance where EU states prefer to get the credit (and </p><p>leverage) for individual contributions, rather than through </p><p>the EU. </p><p> </p><p>-- Third, PM Berlusconi has restated his desire to host (in </p><p>Erice, Sicily) the international peace conference called for </p><p>in the second phase of the roadmap.  In his June meeting with </p><p>Berlusconi, Sharon did not object to the idea as long as the </p><p>situation on the ground corresponded to what it should be at </p><p>the end of phase I of the roadmap (Ref A). Luca Fratini, </p><p>Ferrari\'s deputy, recently outlined what the MFA saw as key </p><p>to reaching that goal: that the US encourage Israel to </p><p>continue the settlement freeze; that the US discourage Israel </p><p>from building a security fence; and the adequate functioning </p><p>of a multinational implementation monitoring mechanism.  (FM </p><p>Frattini, in a June 11 speech at the Center for Defense </p><p>Studies in Rome praised the President\'s decision to send the </p><p>first group of American observers to the region, saying that </p><p>the roadmap cannot be carried out unless there was a </p><p>monitoring mechanism on the ground.  He added that Italy, </p><p>with a demonstrated expertise in monitoring work, stands </p><p>ready to assist if called upon by the US (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>-- Fourth, Berlusconi has invited Abu Mazen to Rome, ideally </p><p>in July (at this moment, it seems unlikely that this will </p><p>occur before September).  At this point, the GOI has no </p><p>concrete objective for that meeting, but we are confident it </p><p>will consult closely with the USG as soon as the meeting is </p><p>scheduled. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>ISRAELI, PALESTINIAN AND EGYPTIAN VIEWPOINTS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Israel is optimistic about the Italian Presidency </p><p>because it will be a "balanced Presidency," said Ofer Bavly, </p><p>the spokesman of the Embassy of Israel in Rome. Israel </p><p>considers Berlusconi to be more balanced on the </p><p>Israeli/Palestinian issue than previous Italian governments </p><p>and EU presidencies.  Given Italy\'s excellent relations with </p><p>Israel and with the Arab world, Bavly expected Italy to play </p><p>a positive mediation role that other EU countries cannot. </p><p>Israel will always look to the US for the leading mediation </p><p>role in the MEPP, but does not mind a greater EU role in the </p><p>MEPP as long as the EU views are balanced and the EU plays a </p><p>complementary role to that of the US, said Bavly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) As far as tangible steps Italy could play during its </p><p>Presidency, Bavly suggested that the EU ought to apply </p><p>pressure on the PA, Syria, and other countries in the region </p><p>that get economic aid from the EU to commit seriously to </p><p>fighting terrorism.  He did not expect Italy to put any "real </p><p>pressure" on Israel during its Presidency because the </p><p>Berlusconi government has a "far greater understanding" of </p><p>Israel\'s security needs than did previous Italian governments </p><p>and EU Presidencies.  Bavly expected any concrete </p><p>achievements during the Italian Presidency to come through </p><p>the Quartet.  Israel expects Italy to coordinate well and not </p><p>to compete with the US in the Quartet.  Israel wants to see </p><p>the US and the EU work well together within the Quartet, not </p><p>the US supporting Israel and the EU supporting the Arabs, </p><p>said Bavly. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Nemer Hamad, the senior PA representative in Rome, </p><p>expected Italy to coordinate equally within the 15 EU members </p><p>and the USG on the MEPP during its Presidency.  It will not </p><p>be Italy as an individual country that is calling the shots, </p><p>predicted Hamad, but as the EU President within the Quartet </p><p>and in full coordination with the US.  Full unrestricted </p><p>acceptance of the roadmap by both parties is an indispensable </p><p>starting point for any serious progress in the region. </p><p>Without that, even the best intentions of the Quartet will be </p><p>of little help, insisted Hamad. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) As long as the EU does not have a common foreign </p><p>policy, it will not be able to exert useful pressure on </p><p>either side, said Hamad.  In order for the EU to serve as a </p><p>mediator in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, it must be </p><p>accepted by both parties.  In that sense, Italy, with its </p><p>excellent ties to both the Arab world and Israel, could play </p><p>a key coordination role within the Quartet, between the EU </p><p>and the US, having the trust of both Israelis and </p><p>Palestinians.  Italy\'s success during the Presidency will </p><p>depend primarily on Sharon\'s continued willingness to </p><p>implement the roadmap --the only possible road to an eventual </p><p>peace-- and the US\' willingness to pressure Sharon to do </p><p>that, said Hamad. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The real test for Italy and the international </p><p>community is the implementation of the roadmap, said Ahmed </p><p>Adel, NEA Watcher at the Embassy of Egypt in Rome.  The MEPP </p><p>will give Italy an opportunity to reunite the EU politically </p><p>after its political division over Iraq and will give </p><p>Berlusconi the opportunity to play an important and visible </p><p>leadership role at the international level.  Italy should use </p><p>its positive relations with Iran and Syria to convey actively </p><p>the US message that Iran and Syria should not disrupt the </p><p>progress of the MEPP.  Italy and the EU could and should play </p><p>a positive role in the monitoring mechanism because they </p><p>understand well the reality of the situation on the ground </p><p>both for Palestinians and for Israelis.  When implementation </p><p>of the roadmap proves difficult, Italy should play a balanced </p><p>role, acknowledging the reality and challenges faced by both </p><p>sides, said Adel. </p><p>Sembler </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME03214 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
