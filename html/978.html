<p>UNCLAS SEOUL 007019 </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, KS </p><p>SUBJECT: REPUBLIC OF KOREA: 1998 ANNUAL TERRORISM </p><p>REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 202128 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) NO PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL OR </p><p>DOMESTIC TERRORISM WERE CARRIED OUT IN THE REPUBLIC OF </p><p>KOREA (ROK) IN 1998, AND THE ROK DID NOT RECEIVE ANY </p><p>EXTRADITION REQUESTS FROM OTHER NATIONS FOR SUSPECTED </p><p>TERRORISTS.  ON DECEMBER 1, 1998, THE ROK NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY RATIFIED THE ROK-U.S. EXTRADITION TREATY; WHEN </p><p>THE U.S. RATIFIES THE TREATY, A POTENTIAL IMPEDIMENT TO </p><p>THE EXTRADITION OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS WILL BE REMOVED. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE ROKG HAS CONSISTENTLY MADE CLEAR ITS FIRM </p><p>OPPOSITION TO ALL FORMS OF TERRORISM, WHILE FOCUSING ITS </p><p>COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS ON PREVENTING SUCH ACTS BY THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE\'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA (DPRK).  THE ROKG </p><p>COOPERATES FULLY WITH THE U.S. IN CASES OF POTENTIAL </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  THE KOREAN GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY </p><p>CONDEMNED THE TERRORIST BOMBINGS OF U.S. EMBASSIES IN </p><p>TANZANIA AND KENYA, AND IN THE AFTERMATH OF THOSE </p><p>BOMBINGS, WHEN INFORMATION INDICATED THAT TERRORIST </p><p>ACTION MIGHT BE TAKEN AGAINST OFFICIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT </p><p>INSTALLATIONS AND/OR PERSONNEL IN THE ROK, THE ROKG </p><p>RESPONDED RAPIDLY, REINFORCING THE SECURITY PRESENCE </p><p>AROUND U.S. DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND </p><p>UNDERTAKING A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE THREATS. </p><p>THE ROK\'S SECURITY FORCES ALSO CONTINUE EFFORTS TO </p><p>IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO HANDLE POSSIBLE TERRORIST </p><p>INCIDENTS.  IN A RECENT EXERCISE ATTENDED BY FOREIGN </p><p>EMBASSY REPRESENTATIVES, A COUNTER TERRORISM TEAM PUT ON </p><p>AN IMPRESSIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THE ROKG\'S PREPARATIONS TO </p><p>DEAL WITH ANY POTENTIAL INCIDENTS AT THE 1999 ASIAN </p><p>WINTER GAMES TO BE HELD IN KOREA. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE ROKG DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR </p><p>INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, AND IT HAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY </p><p>CHANGED ITS STANCE TOWARD TERRORISM IN THE PAST YEAR.  IT </p><p>MAINTAINS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH LIBYA, IRAN, IRAQ AND </p><p>SUDAN, BUT NOT WITH CUBA, NORTH KOREA OR SYRIA.  IT DOES </p><p>NOT CONDONE TERRORIST ACTIVITY BY ANY OF THESE COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>BOSWORTH </p><p></p></div>
