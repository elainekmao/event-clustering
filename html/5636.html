(C)  HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINSTER ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN </p><p>TOLD VISITING DASD IAN BRZEZINSKI FEBRUARY 7 THAT THE GAP </p><p>BETWEEN THE U.S. AND HOLY SEE\'S POSITION WAS "NOT THAT BIG," </p><p>ADDING THAT THE HOLY SEE AGREES THAT THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE </p><p>FOR SADDAM AND THAT HE NEEDS TO COOPERATE.  FOR THE HOLY SEE, </p><p>THE POINT OF DIVERGENCE WITH THE U.S. WAS "WHETHER WAR WAS </p><p>THE ANSWER" TO THE SITUATION, AND, IF IT WAS, WHO WOULD MAKE </p><p>THE DECISION FOR WAR.  TAURAN EMPHASIZED THAT THE HOLY SEE </p><p>BELIEVES ONLY THE UN CAN MAKE THAT DECISION, AND HE STRONGLY </p><p>ENCOURAGED THE U.S. TO SEEK A SECOND UN RESOLUTION.  DASD </p><p>BRZEZINSKI URGED TAURAN TO ENSURE IRAQI FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>TARIQ AZIZ RECEIVED A CLEAR MESSAGE FROM THE POPE FEBRUARY 14 </p><p>THAT IRAQ HAD LITTLE TIME TO DEMONSTRATE ITS WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>DISARM.  TAURAN SAID THE HOLY SEE HAS ALREADY CONVEYED THAT </p><p>MESSAGE TO THE IRAQI AMBASSADOR AND WOULD REPEAT IT TO AZIZ. </p><p>TAURAN STRESSED TO BRZEZINSKI THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT </p><p>WAR, IF IT CAME, WOULD NOT BE PORTRAYED AS AN AMERICAN WAR, </p><p>BUT AS AN INTERNATIONAL OPERATION TO RESPOND TO THE </p><p>"MISBEHAVIOR" OF A UN MEMBER GOVERNMENT.  IN THIS REGARD, HE </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT ANY MILITARY ACTION BE CAST AS A "POLICE </p><p>ACTION" AS A WAY TO REINFORCE THE NEED FOR THE ACTION AND </p><p>MAKE IT MORE PALATABLE INTERNATIONALLY.  BRZEZINSKI ASSURED </p><p>TAURAN THAT THE U.S. WOULD ACT IN AN BROAD COALITION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>U.S.-HOLY SEE VIEWS NOT FAR APART </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00523  01 OF 02  100629Z </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN A FEBRUARY 7 MEETING, DASD IAN BRZEZINSKI (IN ROME </p><p>WITH SECRETARY RUMSFELD\'S DELEGATION) ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON EMPHASIZED TO HOLY SEE\' FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN THAT THE UNITED STATES REGARDS WAR AS THE </p><p>"LAST RESORT" TO DISARM IRAQ, BUT STRESSED THE URGENCY OF </p><p>ACTION IN THE FACE OF THE DANGEROUS NEXUS BETWEEN TERRORISM </p><p>AND IRAQ\'S WMD CAPABILITIES.  HE NOTED THAT SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL\'S UN PRESENTATION MADE CLEAR THAT SADDAM CONTINUED TO </p><p>DEVELOP HIS WMD CAPABILITIES, DESPITE HIS COMMITMENT TO </p><p>DISARM, WHICH LEFT "NO ROOM FOR ERROR."  HE EMPHASIZED THAT </p><p>UNSC 1441 WAS A FINAL RESOLUTION THAT LEFT SADDAM NO ROOM TO </p><p>ONCE AGAIN FLOUT THE WILL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) IN THE FACE OF A STEADY DRUMBEAT OF MEDIA REPORTS </p><p>SUGGESTING UNYIELDING VATICAN OPPOSITION TO WAR, TAURAN WENT </p><p>OUR OF HIS WAY TO EMPHASIZE THE COMMON GROUND IN THE U.S. AND </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S PERCEPTIONS OF THE IRAQ CRISIS.  "THE GAP IS NOT </p><p>SO BIG," HE ASSERTED, NOTING THAT THAT HOLY SEE AGREES THAT </p><p>THIS IS SADDAM\'S "LAST CHANCE" AND THAT HE NEEDS TO COOPERATE </p><p>IMMEDIATELY.  HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT BOTH THE UN AND HOLY </p><p>SEE HAVE EMPHASIZED THE CENTRAL ROLE OF THE UN IN RESOLVING </p><p>THE CONFLICT -- WHICH THE HOLY SEE REGARDS AS ESSENTIAL. </p><p>"THE POINT OF DIVERGENCE," HE CONTINUED, "IS WAR."  BUT IN </p><p>OUTLINING THE VATICAN POSITION, HE DID NOT ASSERT -- AS OTHER </p><p>SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE CURIA HAVE RECENTLY -- THAT THE HOLY </p><p>SEE IS COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO WAR AT ANY POINT.  RATHER, HE </p><p>SAID THE CRUCIAL ISSUE WAS WHO WILL SAY, "THE GAME IS OVER," </p><p>AND WHEN THAT DECISION SHOULD BE MADE.  IN ADDITION, HE NOTED </p><p>THAT THE HOLY SEE REMAINED DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00523  01 OF 02  100629Z </p><p>POSITION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE, AND STILL NEEDED TO BE </p><p>CONVINCED THAT WAR IS THE ONLY SOLUTION.  HE ALSO REITERATED </p><p>THE HOLY SEE\'S FEAR FOR THE REACTION OF THE ARAB WORLD, </p><p>CITING ARAB LEAGUE HEAD AMR MOUSSA\'S LINE THAT "THE DOORS OF </p><p>HELL WILL OPEN." </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>"NOT ONLY AN AMERICAN WAR" </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN HIS EFFORT TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKING </p><p>THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS, TAURAN EMPHASIZED THAT IT WAS </p><p>ESSENTIAL FOR THE U.S. TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ANY WAR WOULD NOT </p><p>BE "AN AMERICAN WAR," BUT AN INTERNATIONAL ACTION.  HE </p><p>REGRETTED THAT THE POPULAR PERCEPTION IN EUROPE AND MUCH OF </p><p>THE WORLD REMAINED THAT THIS WAS AN AMERICAN CONCERN NOT </p><p>SHARED BROADLY.  "IF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DEEMS THAT </p><p>THE TIME IS RIGHT," HE OBSERVED, "THEN THE COMMUNITY AS A </p><p>WHOLE SHOULD TAKE ACTION."  TO MAKE THIS CASE, HOWEVER, HE </p><p>BELIEVED AN ADDITIONAL UN RESOLUTION WOULD BE INDISPENSABLE. </p><p>DASD BRZEZINSKI COUNTERED THAT THE U.S. BELIEVED UNSC 1441 </p><p>PROVIDED ADEQUATE AUTHORITY TO UNDERTAKE MILITARY ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9173 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  00523  02 OF 02  100630Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00   PERC-00  DS-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   VCE-00   NEA-00 </p><p>      DCP-01   NSAE-00  PM-00    SSO-00   SS-00    PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-00   DRL-01   SAS-00   SWCI-00    /003W </p><p>                  ------------------3388DC  100630Z /38 </p><p>O 100546Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO EUROPEAN POLITICAL COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 000523 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE, NEA, OSD FOR DASD BRZEZINSKI, NSC FOR </p><p>ABRAHMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, VT, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: DASD BRZEZINSKI\'S MEETING WITH HOLY SEE FM </p><p>TAURAN:  VATICAN STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF ADDITIONAL UN </p><p>RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>WITHOUT DISPUTING THAT, TAURAN INSISTED THAT AN ADDITIONAL </p><p>RESOLUTION "WOULD BE BETTER."  BRZEZINSKI ALSO ASSURED TAURAN </p><p>THAT ANY ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A </p><p>BROAD INTERNATIONAL COALITION.  HE NOTED THAT ONLY THE DAY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00523  02 OF 02  100630Z </p><p>BEFORE TEN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAD </p><p>AFFIRMED THEIR SUPPORT FOR ACTION, JOINING THE EIGHT </p><p>EUROPEANS WHO HAD SIGNED THE EARLIER LETTER OF SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) REFLECTING THE HOLY SEE\'S SENSITIVITY ABOUT THE TERM </p><p>\'WAR,\' TAURAN WONDERED ALOUD WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE BETTER </p><p>TO CHARACTERIZE ANY MILITARY ACTION AS AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>"POLICE ACTION."  HE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING THE </p><p>POINT THAT ANY ACTION WOULD NOT BE DIRECTED AGAINST THE IRAQI </p><p>PEOPLE, BUT AGAINST A GOVERNMENT THAT IS A MEMBER OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT HAD "MISBEHAVED."  THIS WOULD </p><p>REINFORCE THE COMMUNAL RESPONSIBILITY OF ANY ACTION, HE </p><p>BELIEVED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>CLEARING UP MISUNDERSTANDINGS ON INSPECTIONS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) TAURAN SOUGHT TO CLARIFY WITH BRZEZINSKI THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE INSPECTION PROCESS.  TAURAN SAID </p><p>THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HANS BLIX HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO </p><p>DETERMINE WHETHER IRAQ WAS COOPERATING, BUT HE WAS UNCLEAR </p><p>WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE THE PROOF -- BLIX OR IRAQ. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI MADE CLEAR THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY RESIDES WITH </p><p>IRAQ, WHICH MUST FULLY COOPERATE, BUT HAS INSTEAD CONTINUED </p><p>TO DECEIVE.  THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT INSPECTORS ARE </p><p>NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING UNDER EVERY ROCK, BUT ARE SIMPLY </p><p>SUPPOSED TO VERIFY THE INFORMATION FREELY PROVIDED BY IRAQ. </p><p>TAURAN THEN ASKED IF INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS </p><p>WOULD STRENGTHEN THE SUCCESS OF INSPECTIONS.  BRZEZINSKI MADE </p><p>CLEAR THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF WILLING COOPERATION, NO NUMBER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00523  02 OF 02  100630Z </p><p>OF INSPECTORS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>DELIVERING A MESSAGE TO TARIQ AZIZ </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) FOLLOWING UP THE FEBRUARY 5 ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IRAQI </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER TARIQ AZIZ WOULD MEET THE POPE FEBRUARY 14, </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR URGED TAURAN TO DELIVER A FIRM MESSAGE TO AZIZ </p><p>THAT THE TIME FOR SADDAM TO GO HAD ARRIVED.  HE NOTED THAT, </p><p>IN THE ABSENCE OF SADDAM\'S DEPARTURE, HE SAW LITTLE CHANCE TO </p><p>AVOID WAR.  TAURAN RESPONDED THAT HE HAD ALREADY CONVEYED TO </p><p>THE IRAQI AMBASSADOR TO THE HOLY SEE THE MESSAGE THAT "THIS </p><p>IS NOT A GAME," AND THAT IRAQ NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH THE UN </p><p>RESOLUTIONS IMMEDIATELY.  HE PLEDGED TO DELIVER THE SAME </p><p>MESSAGE TO AZIZ NEXT WEEK. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) IN THE FACE OF EXTENSIVE MEDIA COVERAGE GIVEN TO PAPAL </p><p>AND OTHER CURIAL STATEMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO WAR, TAURAN WENT </p><p>OUT OF HIS WAY TO CONVEY THAT THE HOLY SEE DID NOT REGARD </p><p>ITSELF AS OPPOSING THE U.S., BUT RATHER SHARED U.S. CONCERNS </p><p>ON IRAQ.  WHILE HE REITERATED THE HOLY SEE\'S STRONG DESIRE TO </p><p>AVOID WAR, HIS STATEMENTS REFLECTED AN EVEN GREATER </p><p>UNDERSTANDING THAN WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY SEEN THAT WAR MAY BE </p><p>UNAVOIDABLE.  IN FACT, HIS POSITION STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST </p><p>TO A HOLY SEE-SANCTIONED ARTICLE -- APPROVED BY TAURAN -- </p><p>OPPOSING WAR IN IRAQ AND THE CONCEPT OF PREVENTIVE WAR, WHICH </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00523  02 OF 02  100630Z </p><p>WAS PUBLISHED IN CIVILTA CATTOLICA TWO MONTHS AGO (REFTEL), </p><p>AND WHICH VATICAN OFFICIALS HAVE REPEATEDLY TOLD US REFLECTS </p><p>OFFICIAL VIEWS.  BOTH PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY, HOWEVER, TAURAN </p><p>HAS BEEN CONSISTENT FOR MANY MONTHS THAT WAR CONDUCTED WITHIN </p><p>THE UN FRAMEWORK COULD BE CONSIDERED LEGITIMATE.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>HIS PREVIOUS AND MOST RECENT STATEMENTS PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK </p><p>WITHIN WHICH WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD BROADER ACCEPTANCE FROM </p><p>THE HOLY SEE FOR ANY EVENTUAL MILITARY ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) DASD BRZEZINSKI DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR </p><p>THIS MESSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA00523 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
