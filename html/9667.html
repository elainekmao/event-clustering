<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001882 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: NL, KSCA, SENV, OTRA, TPHY </p><p>SUBJECT: EPA/OIA FIDLER </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 213711 </p><p> </p><p>  1.  (U) Country Clearance is granted for Dave Goodwin, </p><p>Anhar Karimjee, Stephen Andersen, and Sally Rand for travel </p><p>to The Netherlands August 9 - August 14, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Embassy understands that no assistance is requested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY ADVISORY: </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Post provides the following threat assessment for The </p><p>Netherlands: The Department of State on April 21, 2003 issued </p><p>a worldwide caution to alert Americans of the need to remain </p><p>vigilant.  The Department of State reminds Americans that </p><p>tensions remaining from the recent events in Iraq may </p><p>increase the potential threat to U.S. citizens and interests </p><p>abroad, including by terrorist groups.  Terrorist actions may </p><p>include, but are not limited to: suicide operations, bombings </p><p>or kidnappings.  Possible threats include conventional </p><p>weapons such as explosive devices or non-conventional </p><p>weapons, including chemical or biological agents.  Terrorists </p><p>do not distinguish between official and civilian targets. </p><p>These may include facilities where American citizens and </p><p>other foreigners congregate or visit, such as residential </p><p>areas, clubs restaurants, places of worship, schools, hotels, </p><p>outdoor recreation events or resorts and beaches.  If </p><p>facilities cannot be avoided, U.S. citizens should increase </p><p>their security awareness at such locations.  Please consult </p><p>the Department\'s web site for text: http://travel.state.gov. </p><p>In light of this caution all visitors to The Netherlands are </p><p>encouraged to assess their security posture and be alert to </p><p>their surroundings for possible surveillance.  All visitors </p><p>should exercise caution while traveling abroad, as U.S. </p><p>citizens and facilities are often the target of groups </p><p>demonstrating opposition to U.S. foreign policy. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) A major concern for visitors is crime.  Most crimes </p><p>against official Americans are limited to pick-pocketing and </p><p>luggage theft.  However, burglary, vandalism to automobiles, </p><p>and theft from hotel rooms are not unknown.  Recently, theft </p><p>of laptop computers has increased, especially at Schiphol </p><p>airport and major train stations.  The thieves operate in </p><p>small groups, are determined and well practiced at </p><p>distraction theft.  Several official travelers have been </p><p>victimized lately, losing personal and unclassified </p><p>government computers, valuable software and data. </p><p>Regulations require the use of the diplomatic pouch for </p><p>shipment of classified equipment and information. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Streets can be walked in relative safety, but as in </p><p>any U.S. urban city, the same amount of caution should be </p><p>exercised after dark in the more populated cities of The </p><p>Hague, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam. Red-light districts and </p><p>public transportation hubs are common locations for incidents </p><p>of street crime. </p><p>RUSSEL </p><p></p></div>
