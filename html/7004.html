<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002130 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: PRIVATIZATION UPDATE: THE FIRST MAJOR SALE OF </p><p>YEAR; DEFENSE OF PRIVATIZATION JOB LAW </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 2010 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 2051 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: A top GOT Privatization Administration </p><p>(PA) official told us March 28 the GOT is on track to meet </p><p>its $4 billion sales target for 2003, which will result in </p><p>$2.6 billion in PA revenue this year and the rest to be paid </p><p>by installment.  The official defended the GOT\'s proposed law </p><p>to allow privatized state workers to convert to civil service </p><p>jobs, saying it will bring short-term savings by eliminating </p><p>the need to pay severance packages.  World Bank officials say </p><p>this law may violate the current IMF Letter of Intent under </p><p>negotiation by exceeding the GOT hiring cap.  The PA is also </p><p>preparing for next week\'s bid deadline for the purchase of </p><p>the first quarter\'s feature privatization - the petrochemical </p><p>giant PETKIM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On March 28, we met with new PA Vice President, </p><p>Kenan Isik, who had been an advisor to Deputy Prime Minister </p><p>Sener (Sener oversaw the PA until last week when the </p><p>privatization portfolio was officially moved to the Finance </p><p>Ministry - reftels).  Isik said that of the more than $4 </p><p>billion in expected privatization sales in 2003, about $2.6 </p><p>billion will be realized this year, with the rest to be paid </p><p>in installments in later years.  For large sales such as </p><p>TEKEL and PETKIM, high downpayments will be required </p><p>up-front.  Isik also noted that the GOT recently included the </p><p>National Lottery Administration, Istanbul Stock Exchange, </p><p>Halk Bank, and tollroad motorways into the privatization </p><p>portfolio. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Defense of "Privatization Job Law" </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Isik worked closely with Sener in drafting the </p><p>"Privatization Job Law," proposed in February (and currently </p><p>in Parliament), that would allow workers in state economic </p><p>enterprises (SEEs) scheduled for privatization to convert to </p><p>civil service jobs.  He claimed that this law is necessary to </p><p>reduce the resistance of unions that in the past have </p><p>successfully persuaded the High Privatization Board to cancel </p><p>privatization initiatives (for instance, PETKIM lawsuit - see </p><p>para 9).  In addition, he said this law would actually lead </p><p>to fiscal savings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Isik said there are approximately 67,000 workers </p><p>employed in SEEs under the PA portfolio.  He estimates that, </p><p>following privatization, 25,000 will convert to civil </p><p>service, 10,000 will stay with the privatized companies, and </p><p>the remainder will receive severance packages from the </p><p>Privatization Social Support Program, a joint GOT/World Bank </p><p>$250 million fund (the Bank funds 70 percent of this fund). </p><p>Civil service salaries are much less than the unionized State </p><p>Economic Enterprise (SEE) ones.  Several SEEs are virtually </p><p>not producing anything.  Isik estimates PA annual losses at </p><p>$250 million, largely salary expenses in unproductive </p><p>enterprises.  Isik calculated that paying salaries to the </p><p>25,000 people who enter the civil service will cost the GOT </p><p>less than paying their severance packages. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) World Bank official Ismail Arslan, however, stated </p><p>that the WB is adamantly opposed to this legislation.  "In </p><p>the short-run, conversion to civil service jobs might give </p><p>the impression of fiscal savings, but you\'re giving permanent </p><p>employment to these people and you have to consider the </p><p>medium and long-term implications," he said.  Arslan said </p><p>this legislation also appears to violate a condition of the </p><p>current IMF Letter of Intent which requires the GOT to cap </p><p>its civil service hiring at 35,000 for 2003.  He said that </p><p>from discussions with the GOT, most of these 35,000 jobs were </p><p>slotted for teachers, health professionals, and security </p><p>personnel (Isik stated that most of the 25,000 new civil </p><p>service employees would be inserted into the Health and </p><p>Forestry Ministries.  However, Arslan questions whether this </p><p>block of employees would have the qualifications for such </p><p>skilled positions as were initially proposed.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>First Major Sale of Year is PETKIM </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The Turkish state petrochemical company PETKIM is </p><p>slated for final sale by the end of this year.  Arslan said </p><p>the World Bank is watching this privatization closely, as </p><p>PETKIM is one of five state companies the GOT must sell to </p><p>meet the conditions of a World Bank economic reform loan, </p><p>totaling $760 million (roughly half has been disbursed </p><p>already).  Bid submissions are due April 2, and expected to </p><p>be made public that evening.  Though PA officials won\'t </p><p>disclose the bidders thus far, sources at PETKIM have </p><p>informed us that Russian oil companies GAZPROM and LUKOIL, </p><p>along with Saudi paristatal SABIC (Saudi Arabian Basic </p><p>Industries Group), are among the bidders.  Press reports from </p><p>March 23 indicate that the Turkish textile and construction </p><p>firm Sanko, based in Gaziantep, may bid for PETKIM as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Once the bids are in, a tender commission </p><p>consisting of five PA officials will narrow down the list by </p><p>examining the prospective companies\' partnership structures, </p><p>experience, investment strategies, and willingness to post a </p><p>$10 million deposit.  In June, those companies that survive </p><p>the first cut will participate in a PA-led auction that will </p><p>be broadcast live on national television in Turkey.  Once the </p><p>high bidder is selected, the PA will require a 40 percent </p><p>downpayment up-front. </p><p>8.  (SBU) PETKIM\'s net sales in 2002 were $643 million and </p><p>its total assets in 2001 were $727 million, according to </p><p>official GOT data.  Its most profitable years were in the </p><p>mid-1990s, when it brought in $1.2 billion profit in 1995 and </p><p>approximately $900 million in 1996 and 1997 (The decline in </p><p>profits over the past five years correlates to an overall </p><p>downturn in the petrochemicals industry. This is due in part </p><p>to the fact that operating costs for such companies are tied </p><p>to the price of crude oil).  PETKIM currently has 4,586 </p><p>employees and controls 35 percent share of Turkey\'s </p><p>petrochemicals market.  PA owns 89 percent of the company, </p><p>while PETKIM\'s pension fund owns 7 percent, and the remaining </p><p>4 percent is sold at the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISEM). </p><p>PA\'s plan is to have a block sale of anywhere between 51-89 </p><p>percent of the company, with the remainder to be publicly </p><p>offered at the ISEM.  Murat Celebi, a PA official working on </p><p>the PETKIM privatization, hopes to sell as much of the </p><p>company in the initial block sale as possible.  He added that </p><p>the new investor will most likely build a new facility in the </p><p>Adana-Ceyhan region so that it can better take advantage of </p><p>natural gas inflows. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PETKIM Workers File Lawsuit </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Like most large companies in the privatization </p><p>portfolio, PETKIM\'s workers are starting to make noise. </p><p>Press reported March 26 that Petrol-Is Labor Union (the oil </p><p>sector labor union) filed a lawsuit to cancel PETKIM </p><p>privatization, claiming that the GOT should specify the </p><p>amount of shares to be sold, instead of announcing sale of at </p><p>least 51 percent of the company\'s shares.  The union is also </p><p>claiming that PETKIM\'s sale should be held up because it is a </p><p>strategic company with products that many sectors rely on. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TEKEL Privatization Plan Approved </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) On March 31, the Privatization High Council </p><p>approved the PA\'s plan to sell the state alcohol and tobacco </p><p>company TEKEL.  This is one of the four remaining prior </p><p>actions under the IMF Fourth Review. It  allows the PA to </p><p>advertise the tender for TEKEL in June.  The Privatization </p><p>High Council, which consists of the PM, DPM Sener, MinState </p><p>Babacan, Finance Minister, and Industry and Trade Minister, </p><p>may get a facelift soon.  The GOT budget law that passed </p><p>March 29 contains an article that allows PM Erdogan to choose </p><p>the other four Council members from the GOT\'s Cabinet of 22 </p><p>ministers.  Ayhan Sarisu, the PA official leading the TEKEL </p><p>privatization program, said that Erdogan is expected to name </p><p>new Council members in the next few days. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
