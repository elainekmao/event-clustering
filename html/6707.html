<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BRASILIA 000907 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA - PLEASE PASS TO USTR - ALICIA GREENIDGE </p><p>USTR FOR AMAIN </p><p>DEPT FOR EB/TPP/MTA/MST AWHITTEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, WTRO, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) </p><p>SUBJECT: BRAZIL: SERVICES HELD HOSTAGE TO AGRICULTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 50753 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Econoff met on March 12 with Felipe Hees of the </p><p>Services, Investment and Financial Issues Division of </p><p>Itamaraty to discuss prospects for Brazil\'s submission of </p><p>services offers in the WTO (reftel) and FTAA negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>WTO - Submission by Deadline Is Doubtful </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Although Hees stressed that a final decision has not </p><p>been made, he confirmed reports that Brazil may not submit a </p><p>WTO services offer by March 31.  The hold-up would not be </p><p>technical.  Echoing comments made by Brazilian negotiators in </p><p>Geneva, Hees explained that the GOB is considering the </p><p>tactical pros and cons of withholding its services offer to </p><p>protest what it views as a lack of progress in areas of vital </p><p>interest for Brazil.  The most important of these areas is </p><p>agriculture, and the GOB sees little prospect that modalities </p><p>for the agriculture negotiations will be agreed to by the </p><p>March 31 deadline.  Hees laid blame for the difficulties in </p><p>the agriculture negotiations squarely on the European Union </p><p>(EU).  Econoff noted USG concerns that momentum for the Doha </p><p>Development Agenda (DDA) may unravel if a mounting number of </p><p>benchmarks are missed, but Hees responded that without </p><p>movement by the EU in agriculture, the DDA is dead anyway. </p><p>In discussions with Ambassador on March 17, Foreign Minister </p><p>Amorim suggested that if Brazil does submit a services offer </p><p>by March 31, it will be modest. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) While Brazil\'s principal focus is agriculture, Hees </p><p>claimed that missed deadlines in other sensitive areas (TRIPS </p><p>and Public Health, Special and Differential Treatment), and </p><p>low expectations for results on rules (antidumping, etc.) all </p><p>make it extremely difficult for the GOB to domestically </p><p>defend moving forward in negotiating areas where its posture </p><p>is more "defensive."  He restated the GOB position that all </p><p>areas of the DDA must progress together, rejecting as </p><p>improbable that a satisfactory agreement would result if </p><p>evaluation of the negotiations as a single-undertaking only </p><p>transpires at the end of the process. </p><p> </p><p>FTAA - Services Lever </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The GOB has already decided to use its services </p><p>offer within the FTAA as a tactical lever.  According to </p><p>Hees, the GOB had prepared its offer for the February 15 </p><p>deadline, but it was withheld at the last minute by order of </p><p>Foreign Minister Amorim, with the acquiescence of President </p><p>Lula.  While claiming that he is not privy to Minister </p><p>Amorim\'s reasoning, Hees said he understood from </p><p>conversations within the Ministry that the decision was a </p><p>reaction to disappointment with other aspects of the FTAA </p><p>negotiations. In particular, he noted the GOB\'s very negative </p><p>reaction to Canada\'s market access offers for goods, because </p><p>it excluded 97 agricultural products, including many key </p><p>Brazilian exports. </p><p>GOB Demands Respect </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Leaving aside Brazil\'s decision to delay submission of </p><p>its offer, Hees used the opportunity to express frustration </p><p>with the U.S. approach in FTAA services negotiations.  His </p><p>core accusation was that discussions between the U.S. and </p><p>Mercosul delegations are less than frank, within plenary as </p><p>well as within bilateral meetings.  He was particularly vexed </p><p>by what he portrayed as a lack of forthrightness in the way </p><p>the initial U.S. services offer was characterized in Panama. </p><p>According to Hees, the U.S. delegation described the U.S. </p><p>offer in plenary as covering "all levels of the USG," but </p><p>that after reading the text, the Mercosul delegation </p><p>concluded that it does not.  To illustrate, Hees cited an </p><p>exception given in Annex 1 (p.17) that allowed all </p><p>sub-federal levels of government to enact legislation that </p><p>did not accord national treatment.   By his read, this means </p><p>that any state within the United States would be able to </p><p>enact legislation that discriminates against Brazilian </p><p>service providers, without violating USG commitments.  Hees </p><p>said the GOB recognizes that the U.S. government structure </p><p>poses challenges for devising services commitments; he </p><p>suggested that the GOB would display more understanding </p><p>regarding this difficulty, if the exchanges between the U.S. </p><p>and Mercosul delegations would be more candid.  He also </p><p>claimed that information provided on U.S. willingness to </p><p>negotiate Mode 4 concessions was misleading.  Hees stressed </p><p>that more candid exchanges between the delegations could </p><p>reduce friction and help move the negotiations forward </p><p>through productive dialog. </p><p>6. (U) Hees also termed the U.S. "mantra" that offers be </p><p>constructed as "negative" lists as a source of friction. </p><p>Hees claimed that the GOB has not yet rejected the </p><p>possibility of using a negative list.  However, he asserted </p><p>that the U.S. delegation\'s insistence that the negative list </p><p>approach be adopted, without the benefit of a substantive </p><p>discussion of the pros and cons of other approaches, forces </p><p>Brazil to react defensively, taking a similarly rigid stance </p><p>in favor of a positive list.  More or less, Hees said that </p><p>Brazil has to be convinced ) not told -- that a negative </p><p>list approach is better.  He noted that Peru and Colombia had </p><p>constructed their offers in yet different ways and thought </p><p>these approaches might also have something to offer to the </p><p>debate. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Hees argued that the premise that a negative list </p><p>provides for more comprehensive commitments is basically </p><p>flawed, noting that some negative list offers submitted by </p><p>FTAA countries were far from comprehensive ) the devil being </p><p>in the details of the annexes ) including for future </p><p>services.  Countries intent on liberalizing can do so under </p><p>either approach, just as countries can also opt for keeping </p><p>their markets closed, he opined.  Furthermore, he claimed </p><p>that a negative list, at least according to the U.S. offer, </p><p>provides less, not more, specificity regarding restrictions. </p><p>He noted an annex entry covering "all sectors," which </p><p>identified applicable U.S. laws, but without indicating how </p><p>the laws would affect provision of the services in the </p><p>sector; there was no mention of the specific subsectors or </p><p>modes affected.  Expanding on this, Hees argued that there is </p><p>also real value to sticking to a system (GATS) that </p><p>government officials throughout the hemisphere now know how </p><p>to read and use, pointing out that they will have to be able </p><p>to explain to their exporters in detail what services </p><p>openings and restrictions they will face. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) In a final note, Hees asked that due respect be given </p><p>to Brazil considering the extent to which services have </p><p>already been liberalized in the country.  Hees complained </p><p>that the U.S. appears to approach Brazil much in the same way </p><p>as it approaches countries with closed services sectors, he </p><p>presumes because constitutional difficulties prevented </p><p>ratification of Brazil\'s GATS commitments.  He suggested that </p><p>acknowledgment of Brazil\'s current openness would create a </p><p>more positive environment for Brazil to consider requests for </p><p>improving access. </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
