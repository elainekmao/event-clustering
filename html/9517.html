<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001239 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MASS, MOPS, PINS, EPET, PGOV, TP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON THINKS SAO TOMEAN COUP LEADERS WILL </p><p>NEGOTIATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1230 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) MFA Permanent Secretary, Ambassador Daniel Hart and </p><p>Nigerian Ambassador to Sao Tome and Principe Saidu Pindar </p><p>discussed the Sao Tomean coup with A/DCM Brian Browne on </p><p>July 18.  Hart and Pindar stated that the proximate cause </p><p>of the putsch was sustained frustration over de Menezes\' </p><p>foot dragging in paying these soldiers, many of whom were </p><p>tough and battle-tested after having served in Angola as </p><p>mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Executive </p><p>Outcomes outfit.  However, due to the discreet </p><p>encouragement and intrigue of some opposition political </p><p>figures, their limited agenda quickly expanded to encompass </p><p>political demands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Hart explained that the coup leaders called </p><p>themselves the "Buffalo soldiers," the collective nom de </p><p>guerre earned as mercenaries in Angola.  At first, the coup </p><p>leaders claimed their sole reason for the take-over was to </p><p>recompense their back pay.  Apparently, President de </p><p>Menezes had stalled and broken promises to these soldiers </p><p>for quite some time.  Because the amount owed was a </p><p>relatively modest USD 70,000, Nigeria first offered to make </p><p>the payment.  However, by that time, demands had encroached </p><p>into the political realm.  Members of the political </p><p>opposition had gotten in contact with and transformed the </p><p>agenda of the coup leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Hart stated that many politicians were unhappy with </p><p>de Menezes and the public was apathetic.  The President did </p><p>not command strong loyalty.  De Menezes had failed to </p><p>implement the proposal of a constitutional review committee </p><p>because the recommendation called for a significant </p><p>reapportionment of power from the President to the Prime </p><p>Minister.  This recalcitrance had estranged de Menezes from </p><p>much of the political class, Pindar asserted.  Moreover, </p><p>many politicians were dissatisfied with the outcome of the </p><p>2002 parliamentary elections.  These politicians have been </p><p>angling for new elections, and many saw the coup as an </p><p>opening to achieve this aim.  Pindar added that the </p><p>political opposition is probably divided.  While none of </p><p>the opposition likes de Menezes, some do not want to broach </p><p>the subject of new elections because they are already in </p><p>parliament.  Thus, the opposition is divided on the role de </p><p>Menezes should play.  Some favored holding elections for </p><p>both Parliament and President, some for only Parliament and </p><p>still others would be satisfied with no election provided </p><p>Menezes honored the constitutional review committee\'s </p><p>recommendation.  Hart said rumors of Sao Tomean troops </p><p>threatening the Nigerian Embassy were false.  The coup </p><p>leaders assured the GON that the soldiers had been posted </p><p>to protect the Embassy.  More importantly, the coupists had </p><p>signaled their desire for Nigeria to be involved in </p><p>breaking the impasse.  Pindar added that the community of </p><p>Lusophone nations might also send envoys to Sao Tome. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) In any event, the coup leaders have shown </p><p>flexibility.  They had heard the widespread condemnation of </p><p>their action and realized they were surely against the tide </p><p>of African and international opinion, asserted Pindar. </p><p>They stated that de Menezes could return home to negotiate </p><p>with them and without fear for his personal security. </p><p>However, he would not be immediately returned to office and </p><p>would not, in their eyes, be negotiating as a sitting Head </p><p>of State.  They are adamant that the status quo ante is </p><p>untenable.  At the very least, de Menezes must implement </p><p>the constitutional changes for them to acquiesce in his </p><p>return to power, Pindar stated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Hart emphasized that the GON was exclusively </p><p>focused on a negotiated solution, but he also stressed the </p><p>importance of achieving one quickly.  The longer it takes, </p><p>the greater the likelihood that the coup leaders will grow </p><p>too accustomed to their new positions and the less willing </p><p>they will be to relinquish power.  He said Nigeria was </p><p>considering sending a delegation headed by Ambassador </p><p>Pindar to Sao Tome and Principe to join Ambassador </p><p>Moorefield and their Portuguese counterpart in talking to </p><p>the coup leaders. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
