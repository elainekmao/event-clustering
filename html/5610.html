Despite fierce protests by the opposition, the </p><p>parliament voted to approve the resolution in a closed </p><p>session by a count of 308 to 193.  44 AKP deputies did not </p><p>support the decision for upgrading the Bases.  Papers note </p><p>that the decision was praised by President Bush, who </p><p>described Turkey as `a brave friend and loyal NATO ally.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hurriyet" led with a story about military planning for a </p><p>`third front\' in Jordan.  General Aytac Yalman, Commander of </p><p>Turkish Land Forces, recently went to Jordan to represent </p><p>Turkey in a series of official meetings.  The story claims </p><p>that, as part of the long-term plan, there might be a third </p><p>front opened from Jordan in the event that a second front </p><p>from Turkey is approved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Northern Iraq meeting: All papers carry extensive details of </p><p>the meeting in Ankara between Turkey, the US, and </p><p>representatives of Iraqi Kurdish groups (PUK, KDP) and the </p><p>Turkomen.  The importance of Iraq\'s territorial integrity is </p><p>the main highlight.  "Hurriyet" notes a disagreement on a </p><p>possible post-Saddam structure in Iraq.  Reportedly, Turkey </p><p>and the Turkomen emphasized a strong central authority, </p><p>while the Kurdish groups favor a `loose, federal structure.\' </p><p>Papers highlight that the KDP opposes the possible military </p><p>presence of Turkey in northern Iraq, even for the </p><p>humanitarian purposes.  In a statement following the </p><p>meeting, Ali Tuygan, Deputy U/S at the Turkish Foreign </p><p>Ministry, said that efforts to work out a peaceful solution </p><p>to the problem in Iraq will continue.  "Milliyet" reports </p><p>that during the meeting, Tuygan said that Turkish troops in </p><p>the region should be regarded as a friendly force.  He </p><p>warned the Kurdish groups not to try to benefit from Iraq\'s </p><p>current turmoil.  US special envoy Khalilzad in turn urged </p><p>the Kurdish groups to consider these warnings seriously. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>John Taylor: Papers and television news highlight the visit </p><p>of US Treasury Undersecretary John Taylor to Ankara. </p><p>Reports speculate that Turkey and the US are about to </p><p>finalize a `compensation plan\' for Turkey.  Turkey seeks a </p><p>binding commitment from the US side.  Sedat Ergin of the </p><p>mass appeal Hurriyet argued that Taylor has a concrete plan </p><p>in hand, and that the two delegations will work on the fine </p><p>tuning.  According to his estimate, the US will provide 4 </p><p>billion dollars in grants and 10 billion dollars in </p><p>`conditional credits.\' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan to run for parliament:  "Hurriyet" reports that AKP </p><p>leader Erdogan applied to the Higher Electoral Board </p><p>yesterday to stand as a candidate in the Siirt election next </p><p>month.  The election could pave the way for Erdogan to win a </p><p>seat in Parliament and take up the post of Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Powell\'s presentation to the UNSC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Powell proved Washington\'s determination to strike" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (2/7): "As </p><p>expected, Secretary Powell\'s presentation to the UN divided </p><p>world opinion.  Yet those who consider the proof </p><p>`unconvincing\' constitute a larger group than those who take </p><p>it as credible evidence.  In addition, the overall majority </p><p>considers the documents not sufficient to justify a war.  In </p><p>fact, what Powell proved with his presentation was the </p><p>determination of Washington to strike Iraq. . Following the </p><p>second report by UNMOVIC to the UNSC, we shall see if there </p><p>will be a second resolution, which would set the legal basis </p><p>for the US military operation." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Cold peace" </p><p>Omer Celik, a deputy from AKP wrote in tabloid Star (2/7): </p><p>"The September 11 events brought a new political era which </p><p>can be called a `cold peace\', i.e. the reversal of the cold </p><p>war era\'s equilibrium.  As can be seen by the US reaction to </p><p>the 9/11 events, the cold peace requires an activist </p><p>approach to protection as well as a new international law </p><p>and order.  In this new era, the world system must be able </p><p>to cope with crises so that the global power equilibrium is </p><p>not shaken.  The clear indication of this danger can be seen </p><p>within the European Union, particularly about their stance </p><p>on the Iraq crisis. . The Iraqi regime failed to comprehend </p><p>the parameters of the cold peace, and neglected to rid </p><p>itself of weapons of mass destruction.  The Iraqi regime has </p><p>completely lost its credibility, especially in view of its </p><p>history of using WMD against Iran and its own people. </p><p>Nobody considers Saddam\'s regime as legitimate.  Currently, </p><p>the question centers on how to get rid of this regime in </p><p>Iraq. .  The UN has failed to be influential in the crisis, </p><p>and the EU has proven incompetent in its effort to resolve </p><p>it.  Thus the US is inclined to act and use force </p><p>unilaterally.  Actually, Saddam Hussein is doing his best to </p><p>provoke this process.  There is only one option left to stop </p><p>the process: Saddam Hussein must undertake active </p><p>cooperation with the UN." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
