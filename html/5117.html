<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000144 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EU, CA, BK, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA ON ESDI/P AND EU BALKANS OPERATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 9301 (B) 02 OTTAWA 1247 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Canada is pleased with the upswing in NATO-EU </p><p>relations in the wake of the Prague and Copenhagen summits </p><p>(reftel A), but shares our concern about unity of command </p><p>issues.  Lisa Helfand, Foreign Affairs Deputy Director for </p><p>Defense and Security Relations, told us that Canada still had </p><p>questions about how EU command will be embedded in NATO </p><p>command, and about EU access to NATO assets.  That said, </p><p>Canada will be "more than happy" if the EU is able to play a </p><p>greater security role in the Balkans.  Helfand said that </p><p>while Canadian Forces might participate in EU-led efforts in </p><p>the Balkans, they are overstretched globally and would </p><p>welcome a smaller commitment in the region. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Helfand noted that six Canadian police officers have </p><p>now arrived in Bosnia to serve in the EU Police Mission </p><p>there.  This cooperation is part of the Canada-EU modalities </p><p>agreement (reftel B), whereby the EU will consult with Canada </p><p>when planning operations and will invite Canada to </p><p>participate in operations where NATO assets are being used. </p><p>In a NATO-EU exercise later this year, Canada plans to </p><p>participate on both the NATO and EU sides, allowing it to </p><p>test out its new agreement with the EU. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
