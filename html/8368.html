<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003173 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PRINCE HASSAN HOSTS CONFERENCE OF IRAQI RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADERS IN AMMAN MAY 27-28 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Former Crown Prince Hassan hosted a conference in </p><p>Amman May 27-28 attended by 20 representatives of Iraqi </p><p>religious communities and 40 international religious figures. </p><p> Organized by the "World Conference on Religion and Peace," </p><p>(WCRP) participants included Iraqi Shi\'ite leaders Ayatollah </p><p>Muqtada al-Sadr, Sayyid Hussain al-Sadr, Ayatollah Mohammed </p><p>al-Sayyid al-Hakim, and individuals associated with Sayyed </p><p>Ali al-Sistani; Sheik Ahmed al-Qubiesy of Iraq\'s Sunni </p><p>community, and Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Baghdad </p><p>Emanual Deli.  The theme of the gathering was "Rejecting </p><p>Violence and Promoting Peace with Justice."  Key points </p><p>included a call to address the humanitarian situation in </p><p>Iraq, mutual acceptance and co-existence among all religious </p><p>groups, the role of the UN, and the responsibilities of the </p><p>Coalition forces as the occupying power.  At the conclusion </p><p>of the two-day event, the Conferees issued a joint statement </p><p>(for complete text see para 3.) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Comment:  The sight of Prince Hassan among an assembly </p><p>of Iraqi religious leaders has, inevitably, caught the </p><p>attention of many in Amman\'s political salons and, once </p><p>again, has brought to the fore the notion of Hashemite </p><p>ambitions in Iraq.  Whether there is anything to this remains </p><p>to be seen, but it only adds to previous speculation that </p><p>Prince Hassan is seeking ways to raise his visibility </p><p>vis-a-vis Iraq, and is looking for an organizational vehicle </p><p>that could carry him to Baghdad.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>3.
