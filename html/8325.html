This is a DART report.  Several thousand Iranian </p><p>refugees are being pressured to leave their homes in Iraq </p><p>and return to Iran, where some fear they will be killed, </p><p>jailed, or face other repressive measures by the Government </p><p>of Iran.  Since the Coalition defeated the former Government </p><p>of Iraq, armed Iraqis in the southern part of the country </p><p>have threatened the refugees, seized their homes and </p><p>farmland, and ordered them out of Iraq.  UNHCR has met with </p><p>Iranian refugee representatives and local Iraqi tribal </p><p>leaders, but there has been no noticeable reduction of </p><p>tensions between the two groups.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  This is a DART report.  The DART visited the town of </p><p>Dujaila-Al Hindia on 20 May, approximately 40 kilometers </p><p>(km) southeast of the Iraqi city of Al Kut.  The town is a </p><p>baked-brick compound built in the 1980s that currently </p><p>houses approximately 450 Iranian refugee families, or about </p><p>2500 refugees, and a handful of Iraqi squatters.  Some </p><p>Iranian refugees say Iraqi troops captured them during the </p><p>Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and forced them into Iraq.  Some </p><p>Iraqis complain that at least a few Iranians willingly moved </p><p>to Iraq because they were given large parcels of land by the </p><p>former regime. Other Iranians at the compound are </p><p>descendants of the original refugees who settled in the </p><p>area. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DART discussed the refugees\' issues with an </p><p>estimated 60 Iranian sheikhs and heads of households.  The </p><p>refugees acknowledged they were given a total of 17,000 </p><p>dunams of land by the former regime (one dunam equals 2500 </p><p>square feet) and had been cultivating the land for years </p><p>without interference, growing wheat, melons, cucumbers, and </p><p>tomatoes. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>INTIMIDATION BY LOCAL IRAQIS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Since the defeat of the former regime, the refugees said </p><p>gangs of Iraqis, brandishing automatic weapons, rocket- </p><p>propelled grenades, pistols, and hand grenades, have </p><p>threatened them several times and told them they must leave </p><p>Iraq.  One farmer said he had been told he could harvest his </p><p>wheat crop in the coming weeks but after that he would have </p><p>to leave the area.  Another farmer reported that Iraqis </p><p>seized his 75 dunams of land and allowed their cattle, sheep </p><p>and goats to graze on his vegetable crops.  Another farmer </p><p>said an Iraqi man and his seven brothers seized his 35 </p><p>dunams of land and brought their wives and children to the </p><p>land to show them their new property. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Because of the threats, approximately 500 Iranians fled </p><p>their homes near Al Kut in early April and established a </p><p>makeshift camp at the heavily-mined Sharhani border crossing </p><p>point, at the Iraq-Iran border, while they waited for Iran\'s </p><p>permission to enter the country.  The United Nations High </p><p>Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) negotiated the </p><p>repatriation on 22 May of 180 of the Iranian refugees from </p><p>the border post, the first such group allowed to return to </p><p>Iran in nearly one year.  Hundreds of other refugees refused </p><p>to cross back into Iran after border authorities told them </p><p>their livestock would not be permitted into the country. </p><p> </p><p>6.  UNHCR has been working with the Iranian government to </p><p>organize the refugees\' return, which was stopped by the </p><p>Iraqi government shortly before the war.  Before the program </p><p>was suspended, UNHCR had assisted in the return of 1,050 </p><p>Iranian refugees from Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The refugees in Dujaila- Al Hindia met recently with a </p><p>representative of UNHCR from Basrah to express their </p><p>concerns over the Iraqis\' intimidation campaign, and they </p><p>said the UNHCR official also met with Iraqi tribal leaders. </p><p>But they said there has been no discernible decrease of </p><p>tension within the community. </p><p> </p><p>8.  The tense atmosphere in the Dujaila-Al Hindia community </p><p>was underscored during the DART meeting with the </p><p>collective\'s Iranian leaders by the appearance outside the </p><p>meeting room of an Iraqi man, armed with an AK-47 automatic </p><p>weapon, who jumped into a waiting vehicle and sped off, and </p><p>the sound of a gunshot shortly thereafter.  The meeting </p><p>broke up, and two Iranian men, nervously speaking under </p><p>their breath, warned the DART that the shot was a </p><p>`provocation\' and that it would be better if the DART left </p><p>the area immediately, which it did. </p><p> </p><p>9.  According to refugees at Dujaila-Al Hindia, ten refugees </p><p>were killed and seven injured when a missile exploded ten </p><p>days ago at an Iranian refugee encampment at the Iran-Iraq </p><p>border crossing point 90 km northeast of Al Amarah.  The </p><p>encampment, with approximately 500 Iranian refugees, is in a </p><p>desert area surrounded by mines and unexploded ordnance left </p><p>over from the Iran-Iraq war. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Two of the refugee men at the 20 May meeting, both </p><p>farmers, traveled to Basrah and waited for three days to </p><p>meet again with the DART to seek help in securing refuge in </p><p>a country other than Iraq or Iran. </p><p> </p><p>11.  One of the men said he sold his wedding ring to raise </p><p>the 50,000 Iraqi dinars needed to make the roundtrip from </p><p>Dujaila-Al Hindia.  He said it was a small sacrifice if it </p><p>meant that he could appeal to the DART again to urge that he </p><p>and other families be resettled in a safer country, where </p><p>their children could grow up without having to face the </p><p>repression known by their parents. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>THREATS BY IRANIAN AGENTS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  One man told the DART that after the war began on 20 </p><p>March, the Iranian government sent five Iranian `agents\' to </p><p>the compound.  He said the men threatened the refugees and </p><p>their families, telling them that if they cooperated with </p><p>U.S. authorities or talked to any international agencies </p><p>about their situation they would be killed.  He said the </p><p>`agents\' have since left the compound and returned to Iran. </p><p>But he added that some refugees in Dujaila-Al Hindia </p><p>cooperate with Iranian authorities for fear they or their </p><p>families will be punished once they are repatriated.  The </p><p>man asked the DART several times to keep his identity </p><p>confidential and said, "If Iran knows we met you, we won\'t </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>see our families again." </p><p> </p><p>13.  The same man said that the majority of refugees at the </p><p>collective originally opposed the idea of going back to Iran </p><p>but changed their minds after the Iraqi threats and </p><p>intimidation. </p><p> </p><p>14.  The refugee said that 25 Iranian refugee families, or </p><p>approximately 150 people, living in the Dujaila collective </p><p>and in Diwaniyah continue to oppose the idea of returning </p><p>because of potential persecution by the Iranian government. </p><p>It is not a fear without foundation.  He and the other </p><p>farmer who met with the DART in Basrah returned to Iran </p><p>during the 1990s, and both were jailed for more than a year, </p><p>accused of being opponents of the Iranian government. </p><p> </p><p>15.  He said his neighbors are pleading with him to change </p><p>the names of his three children before they are repatriated </p><p>to Iran because their names are of Arab origin and not </p><p>Shiite.  He said he will refuse to do so, and will continue </p><p>to resist repatriation to Iran.   He said he is so opposed </p><p>to returning to Iran that he would willingly give up his </p><p>Shiite Muslim religion and resettle in Israel if permitted </p><p>to do so. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Those Iranian refugees who oppose repatriation say they </p><p>hope the United States can help arrange a safe haven for </p><p>them, away from the threats and harassment they now face in </p><p>Iraq and possibly in the future, if they are returned to </p><p>Iran. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
