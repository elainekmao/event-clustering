<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  DUSHANBE 1266 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, MASS, PINR, PTER, AF </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD:  THE AFGHANISTAN CONNECTION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 291823, B) DUSHANBE 1176 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  INTRODUCTION/SUMMARY: WE KNOW LITTLE OF INDIGENOUS </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ORGANIZATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN.  ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF NON-AFGHAN MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD ORGANIZATIONS ("IKHWAN") OPERATING </p><p>IN AFGHANISTAN USUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH ONE OR MORE OF THE </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST AFGHAN TANZIMS.  WE OFFER THE FOLLOWING WITH THE </p><p>CAVEAT THAT IT LACKS THE DETAIL WHICH SHOULD BE AVAILABLE </p><p>ELSEWHERE.  END INTRODUCTION/SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>TRENDS IN IKHWANI ACTIVITY IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE FOLLOWING REFLECTS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF RECENT </p><p>TRENDS IN IKHWAN ACTIVITY IN AFGHANISTAN.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THERE IS AN ETHNIC DIVISION OF IKHWANIS IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN WITH PASHTUNS COALESCING </p><p>AROUND GULBUDDIN AND TAJIKS UNITING BEHIND AHMED SHAH MASOUD. </p><p>EVER SINCE THE MURDER OF OVER 30 SHURA NAZAR COMMANDERS BY </p><p>GULBUDDIN\'S COMMANDERS IN 1989, THERE HAS BEEN A MOVEMENT OF </p><p>HEZBI ISLAMI - GULBUDDIN COMMANDERS WHO ARE ETHNIC TAJIKS </p><p>TOWARD AHMED SHAH MASOUD.  THIS TREND ACCELERATED IN 1992-93 WITH </p><p>THE GROWING CONFRONTATION BETWEEN GULBUDDIN AND MASOUD.  THE </p><p>RESULT HAS BEEN GROWING INFLUENCE OF THE IKHWANI WING WITHIN </p><p>MASOUD\'S FOLLOWERS IN SHURA NAZAR AND MORE GENERALLY WITHIN </p><p>JAMIAT-I ISLAMI. </p><p> </p><p>4.  AS REF B SOUGHT TO ELABORATE, THERE APPEARS TO BE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT DIVISION WITHIN THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND </p><p>WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST NETWORK </p><p>GENERALLY OVER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER TO SUPPORT GULBUDDIN </p><p>OR AHMED SHAH MASOUD. </p><p> </p><p>IKHWANI AND OTHER FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAMIC ACTIVITY </p><p>IN AFGHANISTAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>(GAMA AL ISLAMIA) </p><p> </p><p>5.  GAMA AL ISLAMIA AND GAMA AL JIHAD HAVE HAD SENIOR PARTY </p><p>FIGURES IN AFGHANISTAN SINCE THE EARLY-MID 1980\'S.  GAMA </p><p>AL JIHAD HAS IN THE PAST HAD TIES TO (AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT </p><p>FROM) THE ARAB FUNDAMENTALIST FINANCIER ASMANA BIN LADIN. </p><p>GAMA AL ISLAMIA WAS LONG UNDER THE DIRECTION/INFLUENCE OF </p><p>TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO FUNCTIONED AS COMMANDERS AS WELL AS </p><p>PARTY CADRE:  THESE WERE MOHAMMED SHAUQI ISLAMBULLI (WHOSE </p><p>BROTHER ORCHESTRATED THE SADAT ASSASSINATION) AND TALUT </p><p>FUAD KASSEM. ACCORDING TO ARAB JOURNALISTS BASED IN </p><p>PESHAWAR, THE TWO GAMA AL ISLAMIA LEADERS HAD GOOD </p><p>REPUTATIONS AS COMMANDERS AND LED FORCES OF APPROXIMATELY </p><p>300. </p><p> </p><p>6.  GAMA AL ISLAMIA WAS INVOLVED IN THE FAILED 1989 </p><p>OFFENSIVE AT JALALABAD, PLANNED AND ORGANIZED BY </p><p>THE ISID.  GAMA AL ISLAMIA WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL 1992 DRIVE ON KHOST.  GAMA AL ISLAMIA </p><p>WAS TIGHTLY ORGANIZED ON A CELL-LIKE BASIS AND SHUNNED </p><p>PUBLICITY.  MUCH OF THE LITTLE WE KNOW OF THIS ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>OPERATIONS SUGGESTS IT TENDED TO CONFINE ITSELF TO </p><p>NANGARHAR AND PAKTIA PROVINCES (THOUGH THIS MAY REFLECT </p><p>THE LIMITED RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE OF OUR SOURCES). </p><p> </p><p>7.  OUR INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT TALUT WENT TO SUDAN </p><p>IN 1992, AS RECENTLY AS FEBRUARY 1993, ISLAMABULI WAS </p><p>IN JALALABAD WHERE (IN FEBRUARY) HE GAVE AN INTERVIEW </p><p>TO A LONDON-BASED ARAB NEWSPAPER. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ANOTHER KEY FIGURE IN THE GAMA AL ISLAMIA IS </p><p>SHEIK OMAR ABDUL RAHMAN, WHOSE ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING BROUGHT GAMA AL ISLAMIA </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION.  SHEIK OMAR OPERATED OUT OF </p><p>PESHAWAR IN 1988 AND IN 1990 -- AND POSSIBLY IN INTERVENING </p><p>PERIODS. </p><p> </p><p>(HADIMAT ISLAMI) </p><p> </p><p> 9.  HADIMAT ISLAMI, ALSO KNOWN AS THE "SERVICE OFFICE," </p><p> WAS THE FIRST INTERNATIONALIST ISLAMIC OFFICE ESTABLISHED </p><p> TO ASSIST THE AFGHAN JIHAD.  ITS PRINCIPAL LEADER </p><p> WAS ABDULLAH AZAM, WHO WAS KILLED IN A CAR BOMB </p><p> ASSASSINATION IN PESHAWAR IN 1991.  THE SERVICE BUREAU, </p><p> WHICH WORKED WITH BUT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER THE </p><p> CONTROL OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, OPERATED REST HOUSES </p><p> IN THE PESHAWAR AREA FOR COURIERS AND FIGHTERS </p><p> TRAVELLING TO AND FROM AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE PUTATIVE CONCORDAT BETWEEN GENERAL DOSTUM\'S NORTHERN </p><p>ALLIANCE AND JAMIAT-I ISLAMI (AND SHURA NAZAR) AGAINST GULBUDDIN </p><p>POSES A DILEMMA FOR TAJIK IKHWANI\'S WHO MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR </p><p>ETHNIC KIN AND THEIR IDEOLOGICAL BROTHERS -- THE IKHWANI\'S WITH </p><p>GULBUDDIN.  MAKING THE CHOICE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT IS THE </p><p>BACKGROUND OF EX-NAJIBULLAH LEADER DOSTUM, WHOSE DEVOTION TO ISLAM </p><p>IS UNDERSTANDABLY SUSPECT AND WHO IS SURROUNDED BY MANY WATTAN </p><p>PARTY CADRE WHO SOUGHT HIS PROTECTION AFTER NAJIBULLAH\'S FALL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ESCUDERO </p><p></p></div>
