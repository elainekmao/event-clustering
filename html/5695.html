<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001033 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EB AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND MOWERY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY: IMF STAFF SEE LITTLE TO NO </p><p>PROGRESS ON FOURTH REVIEW </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On February 12, IMF resrep told us the IMF Mission </p><p>currently in Ankara has achieved little to no progress on the </p><p>Fourth Review.  On the budget side, there was agreement on </p><p>technical adjustments to the draft baseline that decreased </p><p>the primary surplus shortfall to about 2.25 percent of GNP </p><p>(about $4.6 billion), but no GOT acceptance of new measures. </p><p>There has been no progress on the structural reform </p><p>conditions (principally:  overstaffing in the public sector </p><p>workforce; privatization plan for TEKEL; direct tax reform; </p><p>banking sector reforms.). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) 2003 budget. IMF staff returned to Ankara to </p><p>complete the Fourth Review based on two understandings: that </p><p>the GOT agreed to the IMF assessment of a 3.1 percent of GNP </p><p>primary surplus shortfall in the draft 2003 budget (which was </p><p>reduced to 2.5 percent through additional measures); and that </p><p>the GOT was committed to identifying further measures, from </p><p>an IMF list of suggested measures, to close the shortfall. </p><p>Resrep told us there has been no progress on identifying new </p><p>measures.  Instead, the GOT officials led by Treasury U/S </p><p>Oztrak are arguing over definitions of primary spending, </p><p>trying to cut out of the baseline certain expenditures (the </p><p>main issue here is over foreign-financed in-kind supplies, </p><p>for instance, dam building equipment, which amounts to about </p><p>0.75 percent of GNP.)  IMF staff has agreed to several </p><p>technical adjustments to the baseline that bring down the </p><p>shortfall to 2.25 percent of GNP (about TL 8 quadrillion or </p><p>$4.6 billion). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Letter of Intent.  The GOT gave IMF staff a revised </p><p>LOI on February 10, drafted by Treasury and State Planning </p><p>staff without political level clearance.  IMF staff is now </p><p>re-drafting it.  State Minister Babacan told IMF Mission </p><p>Chief Kahkonen on Feb. 10 that he hadn\'t yet read the entire </p><p>LOI.  Resrep opined that this lack of cabinet-level approval </p><p>belies the AK claim of political ownership of the reform </p><p>program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment:  IMF resrep believes the GOT is stalling </p><p>in the hope that State Minister Babacan, now en route to </p><p>Washington, will obtain USG understanding (and consequent </p><p>pressure on IMF staff) to agree to "water down" the Fourth </p><p>Review conditions. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
