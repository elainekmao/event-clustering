<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000583 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GUATEMALA FOR COMATT: DTHOMPSON </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIS, SENV, ETRD, ECON, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOH PROPOSAL FOR SHRIMP RECERTIFICATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) SECSTATE 06760 (B) TEGUCIGALPA 116 (C) SECSTATE </p><p>54094 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary and Action Request.  On February 19, 2003, </p><p>the Honduran Ministry of Agriculture, along with the </p><p>Department of Fisheries, sent the Embassy their proposal for </p><p>improvement of enforcement of turtle excluder device (TED) </p><p>regulations (ref a) following the January 2003 decision to </p><p>decertify Honduras, effectively banning the exportation of </p><p>wild Honduran shrimp to the U.S.  Immediate tasks the GOH </p><p>plans to undertake include sanctioning vessels found in </p><p>violation of TEDs requirements, reactivation of an agreement </p><p>between private, military and government agencies to finance </p><p>patrolling and auditing of vessels, canceling fishing </p><p>licenses of boats found in violation of fishing regulations, </p><p>inspecting all fishing vessels in port during the off-season </p><p>prior to issuance of new licenses, and creation of new </p><p>fishing laws to give the GOH better legal grounds for </p><p>prosecution of boat owners found in violation.  The Minister </p><p>has requested assistance from the US for training of </p><p>officials and fishermen. Department is requested to provide </p><p>guidance for a response to this training request.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) EconOff notified GOH officials in January 2003 of the </p><p>failed TEDs inspection and subsequent pending de- </p><p>certification from exportation of Honduran commercially </p><p>harvested shrimp to the U.S. as a result of their failure to </p><p>comply with TEDs requirements (ref b).  In response to the </p><p>demarche and inspection report (ref a), the Ministry of </p><p>Agriculture, along with its Department of Fisheries, have </p><p>come up with a plan for improving fishing regulations and </p><p>compliance with TEDs requirements.  In order to avoid </p><p>evasion of the country\'s fisheries regulations, especially </p><p>that part dealing with TEDs devices, the GOH plans on taking </p><p>the following steps: </p><p> </p><p>     - The GOH is sanctioning and fining the ships that were </p><p>found in violation of TEDs with the nets sewn closed in the </p><p>amount of L 50,000.00 lempiras (approximately USD 2,900) </p><p>each for the vessels Wendy Weather, Admiral, and Carnival V. </p><p> </p><p>     - Reactivation of the agreement between the Department </p><p>of Fisheries (Digepesca), the National Merchant Marines, the </p><p>Honduran Naval Forces, and the Caribbean Association of </p><p>Fisheries in order to finance patrols, fishing controls and </p><p>auditing of fishing vessels, both aboard the fishing ships </p><p>and at the processing plants at the time of off-loading of </p><p>their catch. </p><p> </p><p>     - Canceling the fishing licenses of the shrimp boats </p><p>that fail to correctly install and/or utilize TEDs devices. </p><p> </p><p>     - Complete inspections of all shrimp fishing vessels </p><p>that will be in port during the off season from February 1, </p><p>2003 to July 16, 2003, in order to ensure that all boats </p><p>have the required TEDs devices installed prior to issuance </p><p>of a fishing license. </p><p> </p><p>     - Continue to convene periodic meetings between GOH </p><p>officials and representatives of the fishing industry </p><p>(APESCA) to establish a guide for better control and </p><p>performance of fishing activities. </p><p> </p><p>     - Immediate application of Ministerial Agreements for </p><p>regulation of acts which infringe on the National Fishing </p><p>Law, its regulations and annexes. </p><p> </p><p>     - Drafting and adoption of a new Fishing Law and </p><p>regulations in order to have a legal instrument that will </p><p>permit the GOH to severely sanction shrimp or other fishing </p><p>boat owners who are in violation of the law. </p><p> </p><p>     - Request assistance from the U.S. Fisheries Service </p><p>(through the State Department OES Bureau) for the training </p><p>of Honduran inspectors and fishermen in the installation, </p><p>manufacturing and maintenance of TEDs devices. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Note: EmbOff was approached on a 2/27 trip to Roatan </p><p>by several shrimp fishermen asking what the GOH was doing to </p><p>rectify Honduras\' failure of the TEDs inspection and </p><p>subsequent exclusion of importation of captured shrimp. </p><p>Both GOH officials and fishermen are aware of the potential </p><p>economic impact of the failed inspection and express a </p><p>desire to rectify the situation as expeditiously as </p><p>possible.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
