<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 008554 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/26/2010 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, PGOV, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: VIEWS OF GOMA UN WORKERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Economic Officer Katherine Simonds.  Reason: </p><p>1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Representatives of UN agencies in Goma </p><p>believe the international community in general and the UN in </p><p>particular are overly focused on the Congo war instead of on </p><p>the deeper rooted problems of the Congo.  While their </p><p>analysis may in part reflect their own tunnel vision, it </p><p>strongly suggests that ending the war will not end the need </p><p>for continued intense international involvement in the Congo. </p><p> On the other hand, in our view, unless the war is ended, </p><p>even unlimited international engagement will not be able to </p><p>solve the sub-region\'s problems.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Econoff\'s five day visit to Goma provided ample </p><p>opportunity for conversations with a wide range of officers </p><p>representing UN agencies in Goma.  Econoff found them to be </p><p>dedicated, professional, well-informed and well-coordinated. </p><p>They form a close-knit community that has developed its own </p><p>analysis of the crisis in the Kivus based on their day-to-day </p><p>experience and they feel alienated from their head offices in </p><p>Kinshasa.  Not surprisingly, they believe the resources they </p><p>have are inadequate to the task they face (a situation which </p><p>the UN acknowledges in its Consolidated Appeal for the DRC). </p><p>More disturbingly, however, they also feel hobbled by their </p><p>head offices in their ability to fulfill their basic </p><p>humanitarian mission.  This "malaise" (which caused the </p><p>resignation of OCHA\'s respected Goma coordinator) is shared </p><p>in different degrees by many UN officers working in Goma. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Clashes with Kinshasa Home Offices </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Charles Petrie, the departing OCHA coordinator, </p><p>devoted a significant amount of time over his last few days </p><p>in Goma to briefing Econoff on the complicated humanitarian </p><p>crisis in the Kivus.  Although he did not volunteer the </p><p>information, he responded frankly when asked why he was </p><p>leaving the UN.  He told Econoff he was tired of being </p><p>considered the enemy by Kinshasa.  (Asked what he meant by </p><p>Kinshasa, Petrie specified the UN system.  Petrie said that </p><p>his criticism of the UN in Kinshasa did not, however, extend </p><p>to MONUC or the SRSG.)  He said he and his colleagues had </p><p>been arguing for more than a year that a concerted effort to </p><p>promote reconciliation at the grassroots level in the Kivus </p><p>was crucial to avoid an escalation of violence.  Their advice </p><p>had been ignored, and they had been forced to watch as the </p><p>number of internally displaced in North Kivu rose by 700,000 </p><p>in the last year and 3-400,000 in the last few months. </p><p>Petrie said that the final straw motivating him to resign was </p><p>the accusation by UN colleagues in Kinshasa that he had </p><p>ghost-written the USG non-paper on the humanitarian crisis in </p><p>the DRC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>"Pacification"--A Question of Definition </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) A Goma-based UNHCR officer told Econoff that, in </p><p>recognition of the need to promote tolerance, the UN had </p><p>finally adopted a policy requiring that all development </p><p>projects contain a human rights component.  He referred to </p><p>this as a pacification campaign, and was surprised to be told </p><p>that, for an American, "pacification" implied encouraging the </p><p>population to accept the RCD/Rwandan administration.  For him </p><p>pacification referred to relations within the community of </p><p>Congolese civilians. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Conflicting interpretations of the word pacification </p><p>symbolize the gulf between the UN\'s Goma officers and their </p><p>colleagues in Kinshasa.  Officers in Goma generally agree </p><p>that the current war is fundamentally a Rwandan invasion, and </p><p>that the RCD is a largely incompetent and extremely unpopular </p><p>puppet regime.  They believe, however, that there are ethnic </p><p>differences (such as the Hema-Lendu conflict) which, though </p><p>they may have been aggravated by the war, long predate it. </p><p>They believe that a combination of development projects and </p><p>"pacification" can help communities of Congolese to live </p><p>together peacefully, both in the current context and longer </p><p>term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>NGOs and Politics </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Bukavu civil society is a prime candidate for this </p><p>human rights training, according to most UN officers in Goma. </p><p> They repeatedly told econoff that the RCD\'s ban on political </p><p>parties has turned politicians into NGO leaders.  Purported </p><p>human rights NGOs in Bukavu really pursue political agendas, </p><p>and these often include ethnically divisive policies.  Petrie </p><p>noted that the Swedes and the Dutch have stopped funding </p><p>Bukavu\'s civil society organizations for this reason.  The </p><p>UNHCR representative said he was trying to convince Human </p><p>Rights NGO\'s that they should preserve their credibility and </p><p>stop publishing undocumented and often wildly inflated </p><p>accounts of violations, such as the Katagota massacre.  (He </p><p>said that he believed a serious massacre of perhaps 40 </p><p>civilians had indeed occurred at Katagota, but that civil </p><p>society undermined its own interests by publishing accounts </p><p>claiming up to 400 victims.)  UN officers also believe that </p><p>political activism in Bukavu is exacerbating the economic </p><p>deprivation of residents of South Kivu by, for example, </p><p>declaring lengthy general strikes (villes mortes) which close </p><p>the markets in which many of the poor earn their daily living. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>A Plea for Roads </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Many of Econoffs Goma interlocutors, including UN </p><p>officers, said they believe the international community </p><p>should put more resources into road reconstruction in the </p><p>Kivus.  They believe better roads will immediately improve </p><p>the economic situation of rural communities by providing </p><p>access to markets, and that reducing economic deprivation </p><p>will reduce ethnic rivalry for scarce resources.  They also </p><p>believe that reducing the isolation of ethnically homogeneous </p><p>communities will promote tolerance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) From a distance, and with the cultural baggage of a </p><p>typical American, the resistance of Bukavu\'s civil society is </p><p>an admirable and appropriate response to occupation.  Calls </p><p>for road-building and pacification campaigns sound like </p><p>collaboration.  The near-unanimous and sincere arguments put </p><p>forward by UN officers in Goma, however, merit attention. </p><p>They at least suggest that, while currently focusing on </p><p>initiatives to end the Congo war, the international community </p><p>needs to prepare itself for a long and deep involvement in </p><p>the reconstruction of the Congo once the war is over.  In the </p><p>short term, however, ending the war remains the sine qua non </p><p>for resolving the Congo crisis. </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
