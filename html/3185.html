SUMMARY:  ESTOFFS MET WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>SPACE AGENCY (ASI), PROFESSOR SERGIO VETRELLA, ON JUNE 6, </p><p>2002.  VETRELLA PROVIDED UPDATES ON GALILEO, ITALIAN SPACE </p><p>PLAN, COSMO SKYMED, AND THE BIDDING PROCESS FOR THE AGILE </p><p>LAUNCHER.  IN PARTICULAR, HE STRESSED THAT ALL EXISTING </p><p>COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES WITH NASA WERE INCLUDED IN THE PLAN. </p><p>HE ALSO AGREED IN PRINCIPLE FOR ASI TO PARTICIPATE IN A </p><p>BILATERAL PUBLIC DIPLOMACY PROJECT TO COINCIDE WITH THE </p><p>CENTENARY OF THE FIRST FLIGHT OF THE WRIGHT BROTHERS.  AS A </p><p>COURTESY, ESTOFFS ALSO BRIEFED VETRELLA ON REFTEL USG </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE EUROPEAN REQUEST FOR A GOVERNMENT-LEVEL </p><p>MEETING ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS).  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>GALILEO </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  ESTOFFS INQUIRED ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE GALILEO GLOBAL </p><p>NAVIGATIONAL SATELLITE SYSTEM PROGRAM.  VETRELLA HAD RECENTLY </p><p>RETURNED FROM AN EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (ESA) MEETING IN PARIS </p><p>ON GALILEO.  ACCORDING TO VETRELLA, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION </p><p>(EC) AND ESA HAVE NOT YET REACHED AN AGREEMENT OF A DIVISION </p><p>OF LABOR AND RESPONSIBILITY OVER THE DESIGN PHASE OF GALILEO. </p><p> WITHOUT THIS AGREEMENT, THE EC AND ESA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO </p><p>BEGIN COOPERATION TO DEVELOP GALILEO AS A JOINT UNDERTAKING. </p><p>ONCE THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED, VETRELLA ESTIMATED THAT </p><p>IT WILL TAKE A YEAR AND A HALF TO ESTABLISH THE TECHNICAL </p><p>SPECIFICATIONS FOR GALILEO.  DURING THIS PROCESS, VETRELLA </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03036  01 OF 02  201700Z </p><p>EXPECTS THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO DEFINE FROM A TECHNICAL </p><p>POINT OF VIEW HOW GALILEO COULD BE FULLY INTEGRATED WITH GPS </p><p>AND GLONASS.  BUT THE LEVEL OF INTEGRATION BETWEEN THESE </p><p>SYSTEMS WILL BE ULTIMATELY SUBJECT TO A POLITICAL DECISION </p><p>WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU).  VETRELLA CLAIMED THAT THERE </p><p>IS NO SUPPORT IN ITALY FOR A "NON-OPTIMIZED" SOLUTION.  HE </p><p>DEFINED AN "OPTIMAL" SOLUTION AS ONE THAT ACHIEVED A </p><p>HIGH-LEVEL OF INTEGRATION WITH GPS AND GLONASS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ITALIAN SPACE PLAN </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE ITALIAN SPACE PLAN, </p><p>VETRELLA STATED THAT IT HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS (MUIR) FOR APPROVAL. </p><p>AN INTERMINISTERIAL COUNCIL WILL EXAMINE THE PLAN AND WILL </p><p>GIVE THE MINISTER OF UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS A </p><p>RECOMMENDATION.  ONCE THIS REVIEW PROCESS HAS BEEN COMPLETED, </p><p>IT WILL BE SUBMITTED TO PARLIAMENT FOR INCLUSION IN THE </p><p>BUDGET.  HE EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD BE PUBLISHED AS LAW BY </p><p>MID-JULY 2002.  ONCE APPROVED THE SPACE PLAN WILL COVER ASI </p><p>ACTIVITIES FOR THE 2003-2005 PERIOD.  HE STRESSED THAT ALL </p><p>COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES WITH NASA ARE INCLUDED IN THE PLAN. </p><p>IN PARTICULAR, VETRELLA NOTED THAT THE ITALIAN COMMITMENTS TO </p><p>THE SWIFT PROGRAM AND ISS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE PLAN.  IN </p><p>DESCRIBING THE CHANGES HE MADE TO THE DRAFT SPACE PLAN THAT </p><p>HAD BEEN COMPLETED AT THE TIME OF HIS ARRIVAL AT ASI, </p><p>VETRELLA STATED THAT HE HAD TO RE-PRIORITIZE ASI OBJECTIVES </p><p>AND LIMIT FUTURE PROJECTS IN ORDER TO STAY WITHIN BUDGETARY </p><p>CONSTRAINTS ESTABLISHED BY THE NEW CENTER-RIGHT GOVERNMENT. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03036  01 OF 02  201700Z </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>COSMO SKYMED </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO VETRELLA, THE DIVISION OF LABOR FOR COSMO </p><p>SKYMED PROJECT IS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION AMONG THE ITALIANS, </p><p>FRENCH AND GERMANS.  HE OFFERED TO PROVIDE THE MISSION WITH A </p><p>COPY OF ASI\'S IN-HOUSE STATUS REPORT ON COSMO SKYMED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>AGILE LAUNCHER </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  ESTOFFS ASKED VETRELLA TO CONFIRM THAT THE TENDER FOR THE </p><p>LAUNCHER FOR THE AGILE SCIENTIFIC SATELLITE HAD BEEN </p><p>WITHDRAWN BY ASI.  TWO US FIRMS ARE COMPETING TO PROVIDE THE </p><p>LAUNCHER FOR AGILE AS WELL AS ARIANE AND A RUSSIAN COMPANY, </p><p>AND MISSION HAS PERFORMED SOME ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE US </p><p>COMPETITORS.  VETRELLA CONFIRMED THAT HE HAD WITHDRAWN THE </p><p>BID PACKAGE BECAUSE HE DID NOT FEEL THAT THE BID PROCESS WAS </p><p>BEING HANDLED PROPERLY.  HE INTENDS TO OFFER ANOTHER TENDER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ8805 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03036  02 OF 02  201701Z </p><p>ACTION L-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      WHA-00   EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  UTED-00  VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OES-01   PM-00    ACE-00   SS-00    TEST-00  T-00     PMB-00 </p><p>      LBA-00   SAS-00     /003W </p><p>                  ------------------C02DDD  201701Z /38 </p><p>R 201721Z JUN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 4363 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>NASA WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 003036 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OES/SAT FOR BRAIBANTI, KARNER, OSTP FOR BRETT ALEXANDER, </p><p>NASA FOR JOHN SCHUMACHER, PARIS FOR NASA/FELDSTEIN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KTIA, TSPA, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: TOUR D\'HORIZON WITH ASI PRESIDENT VETRELLA </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03036  02 OF 02  201701Z </p><p>ONCE THE BID PROCESS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE HAS BEEN </p><p>REORGANIZED. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>FIRST FLIGHT CENTENARY </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  SCICOUNS REQUESTED ASI\'S COOPERATION IN A POTENTIAL </p><p>BILATERAL PROGRAM TO CELEBRATE THE CENTENARY OF THE WRIGHT </p><p>BROTHERS FIRST FLIGHT IN NOVEMBER 2002.  HE BRIEFED VETRELLA </p><p>ON ONGOING INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE MISSION AND THE </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE ITALIAN AEROSPACE MUSEUM IN NAPLES.  MISSION </p><p>BELIEVES THAT THIS EVENT WOULD PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE PUBLIC AWARENESS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE </p><p>ATLANTIC OF THE RICH HISTORY OF AEROSPACE COOPERATION BETWEEN </p><p>ITALY AND THE UNITED STATES.  MISSION WILL EXPLORE THE </p><p>POSSIBILITY OF JOINT PROGRAM BETWEEN THE NAPLES CENTER AND </p><p>THE NATIONAL AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM AND THE US AIR FORCE </p><p>MUSEUM.  MISSION INTENDS TO INVITE A SHUTTLE CREW TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THIS EVENT.  VETRELLA AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO </p><p>ASI PARTICIPATION IN THE EVENT.  EST SECTION WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>DISCUSS THIS PROJECT WITH OUR ASI CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>ISS GOVERNMENT-LEVEL MEETING </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  AS A COURTESY, ESTOFFS BRIEFED VETRELLA ON THE USG </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE EUROPEAN REQUEST FOR A GOVERNMENT-LEVEL </p><p>MEETING IN WASHINGTON ON THE FUTURE OF ISS.  VETRELLA WAS NOT </p><p>AWARE THAT THE REQUEST HAD BEEN MADE AND WAS LARGELY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03036  02 OF 02  201701Z </p><p>DISMISSIVE OF IT.  HE HAS NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE POLITICAL </p><p>AND BUDGETARY FACTORS IMPINGING ON USG ISS POLICY.  SINCE THE </p><p>MEETING CAN NOT BE HELD IN LATE JUNE 2002, VETRELLA BELIEVES </p><p>THAT A MEETING WILL PROBABLY NOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL AUTUMN 2002 </p><p>DUE TO THE GERMAN ELECTIONS.  ALSO, HE THINKS THAT IT IS </p><p>HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT ANY SUBSTANTIVE MULTILATERAL DECISION ON </p><p>ISS WILL TAKE PLACE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE YEAR. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03036 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
