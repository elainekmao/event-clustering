<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 176853 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/10/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AF, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN\'S POLITICAL FUTURE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A)STATE 175414 (NOTAL), (B)ISLAMABAD 5601 </p><p> </p><p>(U) CLASSIFIED BY: CHRISTINA B. ROCCA, ASSISTANT SECRETARY </p><p>FOR SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS; REASON: 1.5 (B AND D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ACTION ADDRESSEES SHOULD DRAW FROM POINTS BELOW IN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS REGARDING U.S. VIEWS ON </p><p>THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN. NOTING SPECIFICALLY </p><p>THAT THESE ARE PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS, ACTION ADDRESSEES </p><p>SHOULD REQUEST HOST COUNTRY INPUT. EMBASSY ISLAMABAD HAS </p><p>MADE A SIMILAR APPROACH (REF A) TO THE GOP BUT MAY USE THESE </p><p>EXPANDED POINTS TO AMPLIFY ITS DISCUSSION. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) BACKGROUND: </p><p> </p><p>-- AFGHANISTAN\'S STABILITY IS PREDICATED UPON HAVING A </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITHOUT TERRORIST TIES, FRIENDLY TO ITS </p><p>NEIGHBORS, AND ENGAGED IN OVERLL REGIONAL COOPERATION AND </p><p>ECONOMIC REHABILITATION. A FUTURE GOVERNMENT WILL LIKELY </p><p>EMERGE FROM THE "SUPREME COUNCIL" UNDER FORMER KING ZAHIR </p><p>SHAH\'S SYMBOLIC LEADERSHIP WITH NORTHERN ALLIANCE, MAJOR </p><p>ETHNIC, PARTICULARLY PASHTUN, AND SECTARIAN GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>AFGHANISTAN WILL NEED INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WITH A </p><p>SECURITY ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD PROVIDE STABILITY FOR </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY, INCLUDING HOLDING KABUL AND </p><p>OTHER URBAN AREAS, AND PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WORKERS FROM THOSE THAT SEEK TO </p><p>CONTINUE THE CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>-- AFGHANS WILL NEED HELP TO FORM A GOVERNMENT THAT IN </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN CLOSE DOWN </p><p>TERRORISTS OPERATIONS, ADHERES TO INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND </p><p>PRACTICES, PARTICULARLY HUMAN RIGHTS, ISSUES CONCERNING </p><p>WOMEN, AND FACILITATES SAFE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN AND </p><p>ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE. CONSULTATIONS WITH COALITION PARTNERS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY ISLAMIC COUNTRIES AND REGIONAL STATES, WILL BE </p><p>IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING AND IMPLEMENTING A SECURITY </p><p>ARRANGMENT THAT WOULD BE WELCOMED BY THE "SUPREME COUNCIL" </p><p>AND A FUTURE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) TALKING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>-- WITH EVENTS MOVING RAPIDLY, WE BELIEVE IT IMPERATIVE TO </p><p>DISCUSS THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN. WE ANTICIPATE </p><p>MANY FUTURE, DETAILED EXCHANGES OF VIEWS ON THIS IMPORTANT </p><p>TOPIC AS EVENTS PROCEED. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT </p><p>INTEND TO, NOR DO WE BELIEVE WE COULD, DETERMINE THIS </p><p>FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>-- AS YOU KNOW WE ARE PROVIDING HUMANITARIAN AID TO COMBAT </p><p>THE PRESENT CRISIS. WE AND OTHER COUNTRIES MADE GENEROUS </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNSYG\'S EMERGENCY APPEAL, BUT THERE IS </p><p>STILL MORE TO BE DONE. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, COULD WORK TO REBUILD THE ECONOMY </p><p>IN A FUTURE AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- USG WELCOMES APPOINTMENT OF AMBASSADOR LAKHDAR BRAHIMI </p><p>AS SECRETARY GENERAL\'S SPECIAL ENVOY FOR AFGHANISTAN AND </p><p>LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM. WE EXPECT TO ENGAGE IN </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM IN THE NEAR FUTURE REGARDING UN </p><p>ROLE IN BRINGING PEACE AND STABILITY TO AFGHANISTAN. WE </p><p>ENCOURAGE PAKISTANI CONTACTS WITH HIM AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE BELIEVE YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN SOLVING </p><p>THE PROBLEMS OF AFGHANISTAN. WE WELCOME INCREASED DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH THE FORMER KING AND BROADENED CONTACTS WITH </p><p>AFGHANS TO ENCOURAGE ANTI-TALEBAN UNITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE HAVE ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE FORMER KING AT A </p><p>HIGH LEVEL AND EXPECT TO BE ENGAGING IN SIMILAR DISCUSSIONS </p><p>WITH BOTH THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND OTHER </p><p>INDEPENDENTAFGHANS, PARTICULARLY PASHTUNS, INSIDE AND </p><p>OUTSIDE AFGHANISTAN. WE WELCOME THE FORMATION OF A SUPREME </p><p>COUNCIL FOR NATIONAL UNITY OF AFGHANISTAN COMBINING THE ROME </p><p>GROUP WITH THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND OTHER AFGHAN GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE ARE LOOKING AT PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE </p><p>ROME GROUP TO DEFRAY IMMEDIATE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. </p><p> </p><p>-- ULTIMATELY, IT IS UP TO THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN TO </p><p>DETERMINE THEIR OWN FUTURE. THAT SAID, WE BELIEVE THAT </p><p>THERE ARE CERTAIN GENERALLY ACCEPTED INTERNATIONAL </p><p>PRINCIPLES WHICH ANY GOVERNMENT WILL NEED TO ADHERE TO. IT </p><p>WILL NEED TO BE BROAD-BASED, MULTI-ETHNIC,AND GENERALLY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE, RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, END </p><p>ALL SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM, AND FOLLOW ACCEPTED STANDARDS </p><p>OF INTERNATIONAL BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>-- BY DEFINITION, ANY TRANSITION OR FUTURE GOVERNMENT </p><p>COULD NOT BE COMPOSED OF JUST ONE AFGHAN FACTION. TO BE </p><p>SPECIFIC, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE ALONE </p><p>COULD OR SHOULD RULE AFGHANISTAN GIVEN ITS LIMITED ETHNIC </p><p>COMPOSITION. THE NA WILL, OF COURSE, HAVE A ROLE IN ANY </p><p>FUTURE GOVERNMENT, AS SHOULD OTHER SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF </p><p>AFGHAN SOCIETY. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT AFGHANISTAN\'S NEIGHBORS HAVE </p><p>LEGITIMATE NATIONAL INTERESTS IN AFGHANISTAN. WE BELIEVE </p><p>THAT ANY FUTURE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE THOSE INTERESTS INTO </p><p>ACCOUNT. PAKISTAN DOES NOT WANT TO BE FACED WITH A HOSTILE </p><p>AFGHANISTAN WITH TERRITORIAL CLAIMS. IRAN WANTS THE SHI\'A </p><p>PROTECTED AND NO DRUGS. PAKISTAN AND IRAN WANT REFUGEES TO </p><p>RETURN HOME. UZBEKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN,AND TAJIKISTAN WANT </p><p>PEACEFUL BORDERS. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE WOULD NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT OTHER NEIGHBORING </p><p>COUNTRIES ALSO HAVE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS IN THE FUTURE </p><p>POLITICAL SETUP IN AFGHANISTAN. WE DO NOT SEE ANY </p><p>IRRECONCILABLE CONFLICT AMONG THESE INTERESTS AS LONG AS </p><p>AFGHANS AND OUTSIDE INTERESTS ARE FLEXIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE HAVE MADE THESE POINTS TO OUR AFGHAN CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- YOUR COOPERATION IS VITAL AND WELCOMED ON ALL </p><p>FRONTS. WE EXPECT TO BE IN FREQUENT CONTACT WITH YOU ON </p><p>THIS TOPIC AND WELCOME YOUR VIEWS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) BELOW ADDRESSEES SHOULD ADD THE FOLLOWING POINTS: </p><p> </p><p>FOR SIX PLUS TWO MEMBERS: </p><p> </p><p>-- YOUR COUNTRY, ALONG WITH AFGHANISTAN\'S OTHER NEIGHBORS, </p><p>HAS LEGITIMATE NATIONAL INTERESTS IN AFGHANISTAN THAT NEED </p><p>TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. YOUR COOPERATION IS VITAL TO THE </p><p>EMERGENCE OF A FUTURE PEACEFUL, STABLE AFGHANISTAN. </p><p>-- WE ARE CONSIDERING WHEN AND AT WHAT LEVEL THE SIX PLUS </p><p>TWO MIGHT MEET TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>FOR EMBASSY NEW DELHI: </p><p> </p><p>-- INDIA HAS A LONG HISTORY WITH AFGHANISTAN AS WELL AS KEY </p><p>INTERESTS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. INDIA, LIKE </p><p>PAKISTAN, SHOULD NOT BE FACED WITH A HOSTILE AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- INDIA\'S COOPERATION IS VITAL AND WELCOMED. WE ANTICIPATE </p><p>A DIALOGUE WITH INDIA ON REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS </p><p>TOPIC AS THE SITUATION DEVELOPS. </p><p> </p><p>FOR EMBASSY TOKYO: </p><p> </p><p>-- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR STRONG INTEREST IN THE </p><p>ECONOMICA AND POLITICAL FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE VALUE OUR BILATERAL EXCHANGES ON THIS ISSUE, BOTH IN </p><p>TOKYO AND IN WASHINGTON, AS WELL AS ON THE MARGINS OF RECENT </p><p>MEETINGS IN BERLIN AND GENEVA. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE ALSO THINK YOUR SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN AS IT GRAPPLES </p><p>WITH ITS ECONOMIC NEEDS IS VERY HELPFUL, ESPECIALLY AS </p><p>PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF HAS BEEN TAKING RISKS DOMESTICALLY BY </p><p>JOINING OUR INTERNATIONAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>-- WE VIEW YOU AS AN INTEGRAL PARTNER AS WE FOCUS ON AN </p><p>ASSISTANCE AND POLITICAL/ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN FOR A FUTURE </p><p>AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
