<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 000228 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, BM, Human Rights, ASSK </p><p>SUBJECT: AUNG SAN SUU KYI AVOIDS JAIL, CALLS REGIME\'S </p><p>BLUFF </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  Aung San Suu Kyi was found guilty of </p><p>wrongful restraint February 21 in a civil suit brought by </p><p>her cousin.  The NLD Chairman says the court\'s judgment was </p><p>"definitely politically motivated," and her lawyer outlined </p><p>several procedural irregularities.  Daw Suu reportedly </p><p>objected to the judgment and the process and was prepared to </p><p>go to jail for a week rather than admit guilt and pay a </p><p>nominal fine.  As two thousand people crowded around the </p><p>courthouse, the government backed off, issuing a "suspension </p><p>of judgment" decree, handing Aung San Suu Kyi another </p><p>principled victory, for the time being at least.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The Incident </p><p> </p><p>On May 8, 2002, two days after Aung San Suu Kyi was released </p><p>from house arrest, her maternal cousin, Soe Aung, appeared </p><p>on her housing compound and accosted her in front of the NLD </p><p>leadership.  He punched her and was banished from the </p><p>compound.  She sued him for "outraging the modesty of a </p><p>woman" and he counter-sued her for wrongful restraint.  The </p><p>cousin had once lived in a small building on the family </p><p>compound, and apparently wanted to move back in. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) "Politically Motivated" </p><p> </p><p>At a February 21 press conference at NLD HQ, Aung San Suu </p><p>Kyi\'s lawyer and the assembled party leadership detailed the </p><p>events of the day.  Both ASSK and her cousin were found </p><p>guilty and received small fines or short jail terms.  ASSK </p><p>objected to the process and judgment, refusing to pay the </p><p>small fine and claiming she would go to jail for the seven </p><p>days if necessary.  Her lawyer detailed some legal </p><p>irregularities.  When a U.S. reporter asked if the NLD </p><p>leadership thought the case was politically motivated, the </p><p>NLD Chairman answered, "It definitely was politically </p><p>motivated." </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) How\'s That? </p><p> </p><p>Soe Aung is said to have been put up to this by the regime. </p><p>Local political analysts tell us a number of ASSK\'s family </p><p>members have been approached by the SPDC and encouraged to </p><p>bring lawsuits against her.  Entangling her in tawdry civil </p><p>litigation with family members would diminish her status of </p><p>international icon.  We know of at least one other suit </p><p>filed against her by a family member. One also wonders how </p><p>Soe Aung could have gotten access to her compound, isolated </p><p>as it is by tight police checkpoints. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) So What? </p><p> </p><p>What was perhaps a regime-supported smear effort has </p><p>backfired, as ASSK once again stood by her principles and </p><p>called the government\'s bluff.  Given the tension in the </p><p>city arising from the ongoing banking crisis, the </p><p>authorities perhaps sensed that this event could have </p><p>sparked trouble.  The regime has backed down for now, but we </p><p>note the judgment was only suspended, not overturned. </p><p>MCMULLEN </p><p></p></div>
