<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002258 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2007 </p><p>TAGS: KBCT, PREL, ETRD, IS, US, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOJ TAKES ACTIONS TO DISCOURAGE BOYCOTT OF U.S. </p><p>PRODUCTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 2221 </p><p>     B. STATE 84703 </p><p>     C. AMMAN 2093 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Gregory L. Berry for Reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)   Responding to our earlier demarche on the local </p><p>call for a boycott of U.S. goods (ref a), Acting Foreign </p><p>Minister Shaher Bak told Charge and PolCouns May 8 that Prime </p><p>Minister Ali Abul Ragheb was trying to discourage the boycott </p><p>of U.S. goods in Jordan.  Bak reported that Abul Ragheb has </p><p>over the past two days spoken to prominent members of the </p><p>private sector and media, as well as the pro-boycott </p><p>professional associations, telling them that the boycott </p><p>hurts Jordanian companies and could cost Jordanian jobs.  Bak </p><p>said the PM had asked these groups to "take the interests of </p><p>Jordan and its economy into account" before calling for a </p><p>boycott of U.S. goods.  Holding up a copy of the Islamist </p><p>weekly paper al-Sabeel, however, Bak said it would be </p><p>impossible for the GOJ to convince Islamic activists to give </p><p>up their boycott calls. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  PolCouns separately covered the same ground with Ali </p><p>al-Ayed, Personal Assistant to FonMin Marwan Muasher. </p><p>PolCouns noted that several contacts had heard direct calls </p><p>for boycott of U.S. products in Amman mosques during Friday </p><p>prayers.  Ayed said that the Ministry would contact the </p><p>Ministry of Religious Affairs and ask that it discourage </p><p>leaders of prayer from repeating the boycott call during </p><p>Friday prayers. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
