<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005511 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/23/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: "FRIENDS OF AMERICA" DECRY LACK OF PUBLIC U.S. </p><p>CONDEMNATION OF MUQATAA SIEGE, U.S. FOCUS ON IRAQ TO THE </p><p>EXCLUSION OF ISRAEL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>WHY NO U.S. CONDEMNATION OF MUQATAA DESTRUCTION? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  A group of self-described "Friends of America" </p><p>representing the Amman World Affairs Council called on the </p><p>Ambassador and PolCouns September 22 to deliver a letter from </p><p>the WAC to President Bush (excerpts in para 7 below).  The </p><p>group members said that they had all lived and studied in the </p><p>U.S. and admired the "honesty, sincerity, and hopefulness" of </p><p>average Americans, as well as the open democratic U.S. system </p><p>of governance.  However, U.S. policy in the region in recent </p><p>months had caused them to "lose confidence in the principles </p><p>of U.S. life and government."  According to one group member, </p><p>"it is a difficult time for people who support the U.S." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The group expressed dismay that, unlike most of the </p><p>rest of the world, there had been no strong public U.S. </p><p>criticism of the Israeli destruction of much of PA Chairman </p><p>Yassir Arafat\'s Muqataa compound in Ramallah, and only </p><p>limited U.S. pressure on Israel to stop its actions.  One </p><p>group member said "the U.S. can stop Israel when it wants to </p><p>-- Eisenhower did it" (during the Suez Crisis of 1956).  What </p><p>is frustrating for Jordanians regarding this situation is, </p><p>they argued, that "the U.S. can do something to restrain </p><p>Israel but chooses not to." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>NOT ONLY WEAPONS CAUSE MASS DESTRUCTION </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The group expressed a lack of understanding of the </p><p>U.S. preoccupation with the urgency of the threat from Iraqi </p><p>WMD.  They noted a "contrast between U.S. policy on Iraq and </p><p>on Israel" regarding both WMD and enforcement of UNSCRs. </p><p>They argued that Israeli actions against Palestinians -- </p><p>"especially the Israeli curfew and blockade" -- are a more </p><p>imminent cause of mass destruction, and the threat is current </p><p>and on-going.  For example, the city of Nablus, they argued, </p><p>has been under nearly continuous curfew for more than 80 </p><p>days.  People cannot go out to shop for food or other basic </p><p>necessities.  The sick cannot see doctors or go to hospitals. </p><p> Most people cannot go to work, or children to school. </p><p>Israeli incursions into Nablus have caused not only the </p><p>destruction of police and security infrastructure, but also </p><p>the British era government center and health, education, and </p><p>land offices, where irreplaceable records were destroyed. </p><p>"Israel is trying to dismantle the infrastructure of daily </p><p>life in Palestine, as well as Palestine\'s history and its </p><p>future." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Given the "existential" nature of the targets that </p><p>Israeli forces have been destroying in the West Bank, the </p><p>group continued, more and more Jordanians were beginning to </p><p>believe that Ariel Sharon might even attempt to force the </p><p>transfer of Israeli Arabs into the West Bank, or even the </p><p>transfer of Palestinians from the West Bank into Jordan. </p><p>"Last year," one visitor commented, "I would have considered </p><p>myself paranoid for thinking this way.  Now I do not." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>"WE ASK FOR JUSTICE, NOT THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  World Affairs Council Executive Director and group </p><p>organizer, Fakhri Abu Shakra, concluded by saying that </p><p>Israeli actions are hurting the "70 percent" of Palestinians </p><p>who are peace-loving.  The actions of the Israeli government </p><p>and Palestinian terrorists, he argued, reinforce each other </p><p>and will prevent a solution -- unless the U.S. steps in.  He </p><p>asked that the U.S. put greater pressure on Israel to improve </p><p>the conditions for average Palestinians, and to reduce </p><p>actions that provoke a violent Palestinian response.  In the </p><p>end, Jordanians are asking "for justice, not the destruction </p><p>of Israel."  He cited the Arab League initiative and Quartet </p><p>roadmap as concrete ideas the U.S. must work with. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  This conversation was unexceptional, but drew </p><p>together the most commonly heard threads of Jordanian public </p><p>and elite opinion on the MEPP.  Despite loud public criticism </p><p>of U.S. policy, this conversation, like most with educated </p><p>Jordanians, concluded with a plea for continued (and even </p><p>increased) U.S. involvement in the MEPP. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>EXCERPTS OF WAC LETTER TO PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>7.  (U)  The group had earlier sent a two-page letter </p><p>critical of U.S. policy in the region addressed to President </p><p>Bush and dated September 10, 2002.  Following are excerpts </p><p>from that letter. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. President, </p><p> </p><p>We the undersigned represent a group of intellectuals, men </p><p>and women, Muslem and Christian, from different walks of </p><p>Jordanian society.  We cherish the values of freedom, human </p><p>rights, democracy, good governance, and political pluralism. </p><p>We believe in the basic rights and freedoms of man, including </p><p>his right to live free from oppression and persecution. </p><p> </p><p>Few weeks ago (sic), you called upon all nations to stop </p><p>terrorist killings....   However, when an Israeli F16 missile </p><p>attack on Gaza killed fourteen innocent civilians, nine of </p><p>them children, and wounded and maimed 180 other civilians in </p><p>one night, you were far less engaged, simply describing as </p><p>"heavy handed" the death and devastation caused by the </p><p>Israeli use of American arms. </p><p> </p><p>Sharon deliberately chose to launch that attack on the very </p><p>day Palestinian leaders of various factions were about to </p><p>sign a pledge to suspend violence, and Hamas leaders had </p><p>spoken publicly about ending suicide bombings.... </p><p> </p><p>US policy has stripped Palestinian violence of its context, </p><p>failing to appreciate that it is the response of a desperate </p><p>and horribly oppressed people against the appalling weight of </p><p>decades of military occupation.... Such unconditional support </p><p>for Israeli actions is heading to become the source of major </p><p>regional and global disorder. </p><p> </p><p>Yet the Palestinians remain the natural allies to your yet to </p><p>be realized vision, Mr. President, to move the region away </p><p>from mutual assured destruction, toward just and lasting </p><p>peace which future generations of Palestinians and Israelis </p><p>can accept and protect.  Such a vision will materialize into </p><p>reality when the relevant U.N. and Security Council </p><p>resolutions, combined with the Arab Summit Beirut initiative, </p><p>are articulated within a short term time-table for Israeli </p><p>withdrawal from all the Palestinian and Arab territories </p><p>occupied in 1967, the total dismantling of Israeli </p><p>settlements in East (Arab) Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza </p><p>Strip and the establishment thereon of the sovereign State of </p><p>Palestine. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. President </p><p> </p><p>You are a leader of a great and powerful country at decisive </p><p>times....Responsible statesmanship requires listening to the </p><p>proposed solutions of rational humanists rather than the </p><p>loose cannons of the military industrial complex warned </p><p>against by President Eisenhower. </p><p> </p><p>The world does not have to be made up of enemies, Mr. </p><p>President.  You are in a position to make the difference. </p><p> </p><p>(the letter was signed by 38 members of the World Affairs </p><p>Council including several former Ministers, Members of </p><p>Parliament, academics, and prominent businessmen) </p><p> </p><p>end text of letter. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
