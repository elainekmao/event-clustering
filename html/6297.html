<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 000896 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA/ARP, INR/NESA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: THIS WEEK AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KUWAIT 0099 </p><p>     B. KUWAIT 0466 </p><p>     C. KUWAIT 0800 </p><p> </p><p>1.  The Kheiran Pearls scandal (reftel A) continued to occupy </p><p>center stage at the National Assembly this week.  MP Mussalam </p><p>Al-Barak accused former Finance Minister Yousef Al-Ibrahim of </p><p>squandering public funds in relation to the project.  In his </p><p>first official statement since his resignation in January, </p><p>Al-Ibrahim defended himself against Al-Barak\'s accusations </p><p>and recommended he take the matter to the Minister\'s Court </p><p>for final resolution.  Al-Barak called Al-Ibrahim\'s </p><p>resignation an "escape from political accountability"  and </p><p>indicated the National Assembly will vote on March 17 to </p><p>refer Al-Ibrahim to the Minister\'s Court. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Press reports claimed that some of the ten MPs who last </p><p>week called for a vote of no-confidence in Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister and Minister of State for Cabinet and National </p><p>Assembly Affairs Mohammed Sharar (reftel C) are considering </p><p>withdrawing their support for the measure.  Fearing they will </p><p>not get the 24 votes necessary for the vote of no-confidence, </p><p>these MPs are reluctant to lose face publicly over this issue </p><p>during an election year.  Because a minimum of 10 signatures </p><p>is necessary for the motion to go forward, if any of the </p><p>signatories withdraw their support, there will be no vote of </p><p>no-confidence.  One of the signatories of the measure, MP </p><p>Abdul Mohsen Al-Midij, expressed his willingness to withdraw </p><p>support if the government revokes the Kheiran Pearls </p><p>contract.  If the government does not voluntarily revoke the </p><p>contract, the National Assembly is prepared to vote on a </p><p>recommendation to revoke the contract and to refer the file </p><p>to the Office of the Public Prosecutor. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MPs Mikhlid Al-Azmi and Abdulla Al-Arada submitted a </p><p>draft law to change the designation for passing dud checks </p><p>from a felony to a misdemeanor.  Designated as a legislative </p><p>priority in November 2002, the issue of dud checks has </p><p>already been addressed by the National Assembly, which passed </p><p>a law removing the criminal penalty for passing bad checks on </p><p>January 28.  The Amir vetoed that bill out of fear that the </p><p>reduction of the penalty would encourage people to pass bad </p><p>checks and undermine commercial ventures in Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Five Islamist MPs are proposing a new amendment to the </p><p>National Manpower Law of 2000 which would set a limit of </p><p>seven on the number of children for whom a citizen may </p><p>collect the children\'s allowance.  The original Manpower Law </p><p>set the number of children at five but the National Assembly </p><p>passed an amendment to the Manpower Law in January (reftel B) </p><p>that granted the allowance for an unlimited number of </p><p>children; this amendment was vetoed by the Amir.  The </p><p>compromise has not yet been put before the National Assembly </p><p>for a vote. </p><p> </p><p>5.  The government referred a draft law to the National </p><p>Assembly to allocate additional funds to various departments </p><p>for the current year.  The law includes an urgent request to </p><p>take KD 500 million from the general reserve of the state to </p><p>meet previously unforeseen expenses related to the current </p><p>crisis.  The Speaker of the National Assembly told the </p><p>Ambassador on March 11 that he did not anticipate any </p><p>problems gaining approval for this request. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
