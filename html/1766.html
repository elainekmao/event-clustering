<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 ABUJA 001419 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR USAID </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EAID, ENRG, EFIN, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: Nigeria\'s Macroeconomic Picture - </p><p>Where We Stand At Year Two of Democracy </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Abuja 1375, (B) Abuja 1374 (C) Abuja 1365 </p><p>       (D) Abuja 792,  (E) Abuja 742, (F) Abuja 129, </p><p>       (G) Abuja 127,  (H) Abuja 30, (I) Abuja 004 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Economic policy and performance in 2000 and so far </p><p>in 2001 have been mixed.  Growth may have been </p><p>sufficient to produce a small "democracy dividend" and </p><p>privatization is moving ahead.  The GON remains </p><p>committed to fuel deregulation.  Nevertheless, the </p><p>2000 and even more the 2001 budgets have created </p><p>problems.  No Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF has </p><p>been reached; inflation is up and interest rates are </p><p>rising; the Naira is under pressure.  Over-dimensioned </p><p>and prestige projects and investments in state-owned </p><p>enterprises raise questions about the GON\'s commitment </p><p>to creating a private sector-led economy.  Dialogue </p><p>with the GON on the budget is imperative, not only to </p><p>support IMF efforts to rein in excessive spending, but </p><p>also to encourage the GON to devote more funds to </p><p>poverty alleviation and growth.  The threatened re- </p><p>introduction of fertilizer subsidies is a serious </p><p>issue in agricultural policy.  Attempting to offset </p><p>these tendencies, the Mission is engaged in policy </p><p>advocacy across the board, including emphasis on </p><p>policy coordination, budget process reform, domestic </p><p>debt and interest rate issues, as well as </p><p>privatization.  The U.S. must take a long-view and </p><p>work with Nigerians who share our vision of reform; </p><p>our expectations of instant results may have to be </p><p>dampened.  Nevertheless, we should seek solid results </p><p>in the short-run, build capacity for the longer-term </p><p>and help our counterparts to develop an enabling </p><p>environment that fosters transparent, responsible and </p><p>democratic government.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>The Political Economy </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Nigeria is beginning a third year of a very </p><p>difficult transition after 30 years of military </p><p>misrule.  The new government faces an array of issues </p><p>that must be overcome if Nigeria is to make a </p><p>successful transition to a democratic market economy: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Pervasive poverty, unemployment and an attendant </p><p>lack of personal security coupled with the political </p><p>imperative to provide tangible results in order to </p><p>give democracy and the present government legitimacy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Weak institutional capacity at all levels of </p><p>government to execute coherent policies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Widespread corruption and an almost stagnant non- </p><p>oil economy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- A pervasive mindset that looks to government for </p><p>solutions to every problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Economic policy and performance in 2000 and, thus </p><p>far, in 2001 have been mixed.  Reforms have not yet </p><p>gone far enough to stimulate significant growth in </p><p>production or new investment.  Expansion in the </p><p>economy in 2000 seems to have been between 2.8 and 3.8 </p><p>percent (depending on statistical source), but not </p><p>clearly greater than the average of 2.9 percent since </p><p>1993, which was barely sufficient to keep up with </p><p>population growth.  Even the top end of the growth </p><p>range would allow for only a very small  emocracy </p><p>dividend - a significant increase in the average </p><p>Nigerian\'s standard of living expected as a result of </p><p>democratization -- and definitely less than the 5.9 </p><p>percent per annum achieved during 1987-93, the last </p><p>period of economic reform.  Moreover, it is unlikely </p><p>there ever will be a large "dividend" so long as so </p><p>much of the economy, especially energy production and </p><p>distribution, remain in State hands and insufficient </p><p>budgetary resources are devoted to poverty alleviation </p><p>and growth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Economic Setting -- Positive Elements: </p><p>Privatization, Deregulation, IMF Targets </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  The ongoing process of selling off parastatals: </p><p>(a) fourteen state-owned (or partially owned) </p><p>enterprises in the banking, cement, and fuel retailing </p><p>sectors have been sold; (b) the Government has </p><p>announced that consultants to start Phase II </p><p>privatization of Nigerian Airlines, vehicle assembly </p><p>plants, palm oil companies and fertilizer plants have </p><p>been selected; (c) the transparent and financially </p><p>successful January auction of GSM licenses for mobile </p><p>telephones was especially encouraging, both for the </p><p>prospect of rapid improvements in mobile telephone </p><p>service as well as a harbinger of the privatization of </p><p>NITEL itself, optimistically scheduled for September </p><p>2001. (Note: In a surprise move June 12, President </p><p>Obasanjo abruptly dismissed Minister of Communications </p><p>Mohammed Arzika, Minister of State for Power and Steel </p><p>Danjuma Goje, and Special Advisor for Economic Affairs </p><p>Philip Asiodu (Ref C).  Press reports have described </p><p>these advisors as dragging their feet on </p><p>privatization.  The removal of Asiodu, in particular, </p><p>leaves Vice President Atiku Abubakar a free rein to </p><p>exercise his broad supervisory authority over </p><p>privatization and deregulation.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  The attempt to liberalize fuel prices, even though </p><p>mishandled, and now delayed, shows recognition of the </p><p>non-sustainability of the current subsidy structure </p><p>costing in the neighborhood of 2.6 billion USD </p><p>annually (Ref E).  The Government continues to prepare </p><p>public opinion for an eventual deregulation of fuel </p><p>prices.  We are reassured in private, and leading GON </p><p>officials, e.g., Minister for Finance Ciroma, have </p><p>said publicly that deregulation is a done deal, that </p><p>it\'s not a question of whether but rather when. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  For the first time in over a decade, Nigeria </p><p>agreed to set macroeconomic targets under a 2000 </p><p>Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) with the International </p><p>Monetary Fund, although it was not expected that any </p><p>funds would be drawn under the arrangement.  As part </p><p>of this agreement, a mechanism was created to </p><p>stabilize government income by stashing away part of </p><p>the oil revenues for a "rainy day."  The Standby paved </p><p>the way for an agreement in principle with the Paris </p><p>Club to reschedule Nigeria\'s debt.  Otherwise, the SBA </p><p>process has been arduous and less than successful thus </p><p>far. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  The GON remains in conversation with the IMF about </p><p>the reestablishment of targets for a new SBA and quick </p><p>decisive action could still pull the economy from the </p><p>brink of macroeconomic instability.  In an attempt to </p><p>address the budget issue, the government has agreed </p><p>with the IMF to undertake a "due process" review of </p><p>the capital budget, where most of the problem lies. </p><p>Ostensibly, this review is merely to ensure that </p><p>correct procedures have and will be followed in the </p><p>contracting of works valued at over 250 million Naira. </p><p>This process is also the GON\'s attempt to address </p><p>transparency and corruption issues.  It is hoped that </p><p>due process review could prevent improper disbursement </p><p>of as much as 2 billion USD from the 2001 capital </p><p>budget. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Economic Setting -- Problem Areas: </p><p>Fiscal Policy, Inflation, Exchange Rates, Debt </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Implementation of the 2000 budget was problematic </p><p>and the 2001 budget is far in excess of what can be </p><p>prudently financed.  President Obasanjo had the </p><p>misfortune to come into office at a time of high oil </p><p>prices, which created unrealistic expectations and </p><p>temptations to spend on over-dimensioned and prestige </p><p>projects.  After low spending in the first half of </p><p>2000 because of the stalemate between the President </p><p>and the National Assembly, spending began in earnest </p><p>in the second semester.  Expenditures quickly exceeded </p><p>the agreed-to targets for the deficit, international </p><p>reserves, and other indicators of the SBA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  Disturbing signs continue in 2001.  The government </p><p>missed virtually all its targets under the 2000 </p><p>Standby and has not signed a new SBA with the IMF </p><p>because of disagreements over the 2001 budget, both </p><p>for its expansionary aggregate numbers and the </p><p>structure of expenditures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. The FY 2001 budget, as passed, calls for 910 </p><p>billion Naira (7.0 billion USD) in total spending for </p><p>the federal government, a 40 percent increase over the </p><p>year before.  Some sources forecast a 200 billion </p><p>Naira (1.53 billion USD) deficit for FY 2001, up from </p><p>a 137 billion Naira deficit (1.05 billion USD) in FY </p><p>2000.  This is largely a result of the capital </p><p>expenditures, which are almost three times as great as </p><p>the amount agreed for FY 2000 under the SBA and about </p><p>80 greater than budgeted in the year before.  To </p><p>further complicate matters, on top of the ordinary </p><p>budget, under pressure from the States, the Federal </p><p>Government has agreed to distribute about 60 percent </p><p>of the "rainy day" fund to the States and Local </p><p>Governments this year, about 900 million USD. </p><p>Moreover, plans seem to be afoot for a "supplementary" </p><p>budget that would further exacerbate the macro- </p><p>economic picture.  Nevertheless, GON senior advisors </p><p>maintained June 12 that the approximately 100 million </p><p>USD "supplementary budget" would have "absolutely </p><p>zero" net effect on capital spending for the year (Ref </p><p>A).  Notwithstanding that assurance, full execution of </p><p>the 2001 budget, with the additional pressure from a </p><p>supplementary budget, could threaten a macro-economic </p><p>meltdown. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. A review of the 2001 budget reveals unnecessary </p><p>spending on wasteful or over-dimensioned capital </p><p>projects like the national stadium, a huge water </p><p>supply project for Abuja, and investments in moribund </p><p>state-owned enterprises like the Ajeokuta steel mill </p><p>(Refs F&I).  A high proportion of the capital budget </p><p>goes to building Abuja, the new seat of government, </p><p>and the construction of government buildings in other </p><p>parts of the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. The government has announced re-introduction of </p><p>fertilizer subsidies even though these have never </p><p>reached the poor and are a fount of corruption (Refs </p><p>G&H). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  Signs of impending instability from budget </p><p>mismanagement abound.  During April, for example, the </p><p>Central Bank, in order to mop up the excess liquidity </p><p>from large capital projects, was forced to raise the </p><p>Minimum Discount Rate from 15.5 to 16.5 percent, the </p><p>Cash Reserve Requirement from 11 to 12.5 percent and </p><p>the Minimum Liquidity Ratio from 35 to 40 percent.  At </p><p>the time, CBN officials said the moves were very </p><p>temporary.  In a conversation with EconChief June 15, </p><p>however, CBN senior staff said the new rates could </p><p>remain in effect indefinitely and there would be </p><p>further hikes if the National Assembly were to show </p><p>further "irresponsibility."  In response to the CBN </p><p>actions, the inter-bank lending rates peaked in recent </p><p>weeks at 50 percent, but have dropped back to the 25- </p><p>35 percent range, still up from the February maximum </p><p>lending rate of 26 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. Inflation, which by the end of 1999 was virtually </p><p>zero, 2-4 percent, by April had climbed back to over </p><p>23 percent per annum.  It seems to have moderated </p><p>somewhat since then but still remains excessive, </p><p>particularly for food which accounts for two-thirds of </p><p>the "basket of good and services" the CBN uses in </p><p>computing the Consumer Price Index.  That measure of </p><p>price increase, according the Central Bank, is fully </p><p>17 percent higher today than it was at this time last </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  IMF and World Bank economists tell us that for </p><p>large GON capital undertakings, 65 to 85 percent of </p><p>the money actually spent on projects goes to foreign </p><p>inputs.  The total effect of purchasing these inputs </p><p>(denominated in U.S. dollars) and of exchanging Naira </p><p>skimmed from contracts has been to exert extreme </p><p>downward pressure on the value of the Naira, which the </p><p>CBN must defend in foreign exchange markets.  Thus far </p><p>in 2001, the Inter-Bank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) </p><p>rate has gyrated dramatically from near 100 Naira to </p><p>the dollar to almost 130 Naira per dollar.  A </p><p>disturbing and variable gap between the IFEM and </p><p>parallel market has developed, increasing the </p><p>incentives for corruption through "round-tripping," a </p><p>procedure by which funds obtained from the Central </p><p>Bank at preferential rates are then sold at a mark up </p><p>in the parallel market. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  Apart from the issues of deficit, soaring </p><p>inflation, and the plunging value of the Naira -- and </p><p>the political problems these will entail -- one cannot </p><p>but wonder if the FY 2001 budget represents a return </p><p>to the mentality of the 70s and 80s in which </p><p>government, not the private sector, was seen to be the </p><p>engine of economic growth.  As in previous years, the </p><p>budget systematically UNDER funds: primary health </p><p>care; education; farm-to-market road construction and </p><p>maintenance; collection, analysis, and publication of </p><p>data; the judiciary; and funding of the elections and </p><p>anti-corruption commissions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. At the end of 2000 Nigeria\'s external public </p><p>medium- and long-term debt was estimated at 32.2 </p><p>billion USD consisting of 28.4 billion USD to </p><p>bilateral and multilateral donors (less than 1 billion </p><p>to the U.S.) and 3.8 billion USD to commercial </p><p>creditors.  Debt service due in 2000 was 14.5 percent </p><p>of exports, not high for Africa, but actual payments </p><p>reached only 8.1 percent of exports.  Nigeria reached </p><p>an agreement in 2000 with the Paris Club to reschedule </p><p>22.7 billion USD.  Payments due under the agreement </p><p>were 700 million in 2000, not fully paid, and 1.0 </p><p>billion USD in 2001.  The Paris Club rescheduling also </p><p>is complicated by a stall in the bilateral </p><p>negotiations between Nigeria and 10 of it creditors. </p><p>Debt Management Office officials told EconChief June </p><p>12 that the GON would request a three-month extension </p><p>on the Paris Club bilaterals so that the U.S. and nine </p><p>other creditor nations might "develop reasonable </p><p>positions" on debt relief (Ref A).  Further, Nigeria\'s </p><p>argument that its development is strongly inhibited by </p><p>debt is undermined both by the current price of oil </p><p>and its record so far of failing to direct it\'s OWN </p><p>resources to poverty-reducing and developmental ends. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>The Way Ahead & USG Assistance </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. Should the overall picture discourage us?  No, </p><p>there are positive signs and a commitment in many </p><p>quarters to substantive reform.  The government has </p><p>reiterated is decision to deregulate fuel prices, for </p><p>instance, the first step in being able to privatize </p><p>fuel production, refining and distribution. </p><p>Privatization is moving into Phase II and has a strong </p><p>champion in President Obasanjo, Vice President </p><p>Abubakar and other leading government officials; the </p><p>BPE has a dynamic leader in Nasir el-Rufai. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. In macro-economic policy, we have seen CBN, with </p><p>the blessing of the Ministry of Finance, go to the </p><p>market with a new instrument, the CBN Certificate </p><p>issued in 180- and 360-day terms and bearing a better </p><p>rate than the traditional T-Bills.  CBN Director of </p><p>Research Joseph Nnanna up-dated EconChief on the </p><p>certificates program June 18.  Originally, the CBN had </p><p>planned on sterilizing 100 Billion Naira via the </p><p>certificate program.  Eighty billion of that goal was </p><p>reached through four public offerings by mid-term of </p><p>the second quarter.  Seventy-five percent of the </p><p>certificates sold pay 19 percent per annum on a 180- </p><p>day term; the balance pay 21.5 on a 360-day term. </p><p>Additionally, and due to three rediscount rate hikes </p><p>this year, the CBN had, as of June 15, sterilized an </p><p>additional 51 billion Naira via the sale of 90-day T- </p><p>Bills at 17 percent per annum. Although these </p><p>movements may not be enough in the short-run, they do </p><p>represent a change in interest rate policy that is </p><p>necessary for macroeconomic management in the future. </p><p>The CBN clearly is prepared to take the heat for its </p><p>increased prudence in managing macro-economic policy </p><p>development. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. The U.S. is actively engaged in seeking to </p><p>influence the course of Nigerian policy-making </p><p>procedures and economic performance.   Early in the </p><p>Obasanjo Administration, the US responded to an IMF </p><p>request for placement of a long-term advisor in the </p><p>nascent Economic Policy Coordinating Committee (EPCC) </p><p>in the Vice President\'s office.  The EPCC is a kind of </p><p>economic cabinet, covering a wide range of macro- </p><p>economic and poverty reduction issues.  The U.S. </p><p>advisor has been well received and put in charge of </p><p>chairing fortnightly meetings of the Technical </p><p>Committee, which he initiated.  This will be the first </p><p>time economic policies are discussed in an open forum </p><p>with all key Ministers present.  The EPCC also will </p><p>host public fora for discussions of inflation and </p><p>unpopular reforms such as petroleum price </p><p>deregulation.  Our Embassy is also developing programs </p><p>to engage labor leaders and others as constructive </p><p>interlocutors in the national economic policy dialog. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. The U.S. has also secured GON agreement to placing </p><p>two Treasury employees at critical interstices of the </p><p>GON\'s financial structure.  One, at the Ministry of </p><p>Finance, will provide assistance to the resurrected </p><p>Budget Office in developing a rational budget process </p><p>for the GON.  This is critical support for a </p><p>government without a formal budget process, where </p><p>individual Ministries hold private bank accounts, and </p><p>no one knows the actual number of Federal Government </p><p>employees.  The possibility of further support is </p><p>under consideration.  The second Treasury employee, </p><p>assigned to the recently re-structured Debt Management </p><p>Office, will provide domestic debt management </p><p>expertise, complementing a World Bank officer already </p><p>working the external debt account.  The assistance of </p><p>our advisor should prove critical in Nigeria\'s effort </p><p>to create a stable demand for Federal debt instruments </p><p>of extended maturity and at reduced interest rates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. The U.S. also has provided the Bureau of </p><p>Privatization (BPE) with a team of advisors </p><p>specializing in areas essential to a rational </p><p>privatization process, among them, valuation </p><p>procedures, transaction dynamics, labor retrenchment </p><p>issues and public awareness.  The U.S. is the leading </p><p>external supporter of the BPE.  Other donors see USG </p><p>assistance as a precondition for their own </p><p>involvement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. Even if the Nigerian economy is in for a rough </p><p>ride in the short and medium term -- higher inflation </p><p>and a soaring exchange rate  upporters of Nigeria </p><p>economic transformation </p><p>need to keep in view a longer- </p><p>term perspective, and perhaps even ratchet down </p><p>expectations of the possible in the short-run. </p><p>Democracy is a learning process and suffering the </p><p>consequences of mistakes can itself be a learning </p><p>experience.  We need to work with people -- and there </p><p>are a lot of them -- who share our vision of reform. </p><p>We should seek solid results that make a difference in </p><p>the short-run, that build capacity for the longer- </p><p>term, and that help our counterparts to fulfill </p><p>effectively their charge to ensure an enabling </p><p>environment that fosters transparent, responsible and </p><p>democratic government.  Our efforts must continue. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
