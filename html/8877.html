(SBU) SUMMARY:  In a move that has left Vietnamese IPR </p><p>agencies, foreign donors, and trademark holders/seekers </p><p>stunned and seriously concerned, the Government of Vietnam </p><p>has decided to transfer the trademark function from the </p><p>National Office of Industrial Property (NOIP) in the </p><p>Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) to the Ministry of </p><p>Trade (MOT).  This move increases the number of Ministries </p><p>involved in IPR from 2 to three and splits trademarks away </p><p>from patents (which remain under NOIP), contrary to </p><p>international trends in IP administration.  In addition, </p><p>copyright issues related to software will be moved from the </p><p>Copyright office (COV) at the Ministry of Culture and </p><p>Information (MOCI) to NOIP.  The decision was made at the </p><p>highest political level via Prime Ministerial Decree and </p><p>against the recommendations of IPR experts and donors. The </p><p>decree effectively strips NOIP of its responsibility for </p><p>trademarks and adds responsibility for copyright (except for </p><p>cultural and art works).  In addition, the decree changes </p><p>NOIP\'s name to the National Office of Intellectual Property. </p><p>Decree 54 was published in the Official Gazette on June 06 </p><p>and will become effective June 21. Therefore, as of Friday </p><p>June 20, 2003, Vietnam\'s ability to register, adjudicate or </p><p>enforce trademarks will be suspended for an indeterminate </p><p>period of time.  The adjudication of all pending </p><p>applications or complaints is already suspended and no new </p><p>applications are being accepted. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) While the political decision has been made, it </p><p>appears the GVN has not given much thought to how it will </p><p>implement these changes; as of June 20 no detailed plan has </p><p>been released regarding how this handover will be done - or </p><p>when.  Although there has been no announcement, NOIP </p><p>believes that all its trademark personnel and "movable" </p><p>facilities will be transferred to MOT and that a decree will </p><p>be issued next week. (MOT currently does not have any </p><p>trademark specialists on its staff.)  Even after the change </p><p>is effected, the consensus in the IPR community here is that </p><p>Vietnam is moving toward a more incoherent system of IPR </p><p>management. Although NOIP apparently made a valiant effort </p><p>to argue the merits of the proposed change, their factual </p><p>arguments (and those of other experts) have fallen on deaf </p><p>ears.  The changes put in jeopardy the extensive investment </p><p>international donors (particularly the Japanese and the </p><p>Swiss) have made in enhancing the capacity of NOIP. Vietnam </p><p>has not notified WIPO of the changes and may soon be in </p><p>violation of its international obligations, in particular, </p><p>to accept, process, and enforce trademark applications. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Embassy\'s attempts to clarify the status with MOT </p><p>have been unsuccessful.  No one in the GVN seems to know </p><p>what will happen or why Vietnam has chosen to reverse the </p><p>progress it has made. If there is a greater policy strategy </p><p>out there, no one in the IPR community here has been able to </p><p>discover it.  Although we hesitate to draw the simplest </p><p>conclusion, i.e. follow the money and power, it may be the </p><p>most accurate in this case.  The Minister of Trade\'s star </p><p>seems to be rising, partly because of his tough stance with </p><p>the U.S on catfish and textiles, as well as the success for </p><p>Vietnam of the BTA.  Few believe that the Prime Minister\'s </p><p>decision can be reversed but Embassy is working with local </p><p>experts and Embassies to take a concerted approach with the </p><p>GVN, registering our concern about the change, in particular </p><p>the effect on NOIP and Vietnam\'s ability to manage </p><p>trademarks, and outlining our expectations that Vietnam </p><p>fulfill its international obligations. In addition, </p><p>Embassies discussed recommending to the GVN that they assign </p><p>overall coordinating responsibility for IPR to the Office of </p><p>the Government under the Prime Minister (OOG), in the same </p><p>manner that OOG coordinates BTA implementation. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>History of a Questionable Decision </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Last year, the Ministry of Science and </p><p>Technology\'s  National Office of Industrial Property, other </p><p>international IPR experts and a number of donors proposed a </p><p>strengthening and consolidation of the IPR responsibilities </p><p>in the Vietnamese government (GVN).  Expectations were that </p><p>NOIP would receive more authority, including taking over </p><p>copyright from the Ministry of Culture and Information. </p><p>However, the Ministry of Trade (MOT) has apparently been </p><p>lobbying heavily with the Prime Minister\'s office to have </p><p>the trademark registration function of the trademark office </p><p>moved to MOT.  The Decree stipulate that trademark office in </p><p>its entirety is not moving, just the registration and </p><p>renewal function.  The remainder of trademark function and </p><p>patents will remain with NOIP, now to be renamed the </p><p>National Office of INTELLECTUAL Property.  The trademark </p><p>office generates revenues of about USD 3 million per year, </p><p>which constitutes 80 percent of NOIP\'s total revenues. NOIP </p><p>keeps about 20 percent of that total to finance the </p><p>operation of the patent and trademark office. Local IPR </p><p>experts assume that MOT will now keep those funds (and cite </p><p>it as a possible motivation for this move). Officially, the </p><p>GVN has not clarified how much - if any - of those funds </p><p>will be retained at NOIP to finance the rest of its </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) While the political decision has been made, it </p><p>appears the GVN has not given much thought to how it will </p><p>implement these changes. The change is set to take place on </p><p>June 23, however, no detailed plan has been released </p><p>regarding how this handover will be done - or when.  Neither </p><p>MOT nor MOCI have submitted to the Government the </p><p>legislation describing the parallel changes that need to be </p><p>made to their own organizational structure, although we have </p><p>heard that one on MOT is coming out soon.  No formal </p><p>announcement has been made regarding whether NOIP staff will </p><p>be transferred to MOT. MOT currently does not have trademark </p><p>specialists on its staff and, according to a number of </p><p>contacts, does not want to bring onboard NOIP\'s trademark </p><p>specialists.  However, we understand from NOIP that they </p><p>expect that personnel and "movable" facilities will be </p><p>transferred to MOT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Additionally, NOIP will apparently continue to be </p><p>in charge of the drafting of laws and provision of </p><p>information to the public related to trademarks. It is not </p><p>clear how the  adjudication and appeal functions will work </p><p>as MOT did not request their transfer.  The only thing that </p><p>is clear at this point is that NOIP won\'t be doing trademark </p><p>registration and renewals or collecting those fees. </p><p>Additionally, counter to the need to tighten search and </p><p>examination procedures with new registrations, one of MOT\'s </p><p>"selling points" was their promise to register trademarks in </p><p>15 days or less, which would make adequate search, </p><p>examination, and opposition periods impossible. While </p><p>officials from MOT have been quiet on the issue, officials </p><p>from both COV and MOST have expressed a great deal of </p><p>frustration with the decision. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Econ Counselor recently met with local IPR lawyers, </p><p>technical assistance experts, visiting experts from IPR </p><p>associations in Bangkok, and other donor Embassies.  All </p><p>are extremely concerned by this turn of events and all of </p><p>whom confirmed that they, like us, had been unable to obtain </p><p>any clarification of the GVN\'s plans, even though as of </p><p>Friday June 20, 2003, Vietnam will apparently cease to </p><p>issue, adjudicate, enforce, or initiate new trademarks. </p><p>Even after the change is effected, the consensus in the IPR </p><p>community here is that Vietnam is moving toward a more </p><p>incoherent system of IPR management. In the short- to medium </p><p>term  this reorganization will make both registration and </p><p>protection of IPR more complicated and difficult than it </p><p>already is.  Businesses will now need to go NOIP for pirated </p><p>computer software, the COV for pirated music CDs/DVDs and </p><p>movies, and the yet to be established trademark office under </p><p>MOT for counterfeit goods. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Most disturbing about this turn of events is that </p><p>NOIP apparently made a valiant effort to argue the merits of </p><p>the proposed change.  However, their factual arguments (and </p><p>those of other experts and donors) have fallen in deaf ears. </p><p>In particular, NOIP clarified for the PM\'s office that </p><p>registration of IP rights is a legal procedure for </p><p>establishment of IPR, not for administrative management, </p><p>that is, registration is the process of establishment of </p><p>trademark and appellation origin rights. They argued that </p><p>internationally, most countries have a combined office for </p><p>patents and trademarks, primarily because procedures for </p><p>registration of trademark, patent and design tend to be </p><p>uniform; splitting the offices will cause duplication and </p><p>redundancy and is counter to international norms. NOIP </p><p>argued that the move would cause trademark registration 350 </p><p>trademark applications/ week) to come to a standstill, as </p><p>the details of the move is sorted out.  Finally, NOIP argued </p><p>that at present, the most serious challenges for Vietnam are </p><p>raising awareness of IPR and enforcement of existing laws. </p><p>They argued that the focus of any change should be to give </p><p>higher priority to protection of IPR and improved service </p><p>quality from GVN agencies.  Specifically, several Ministries </p><p>and agencies (including MOT) already have significant </p><p>responsibility for protecting IPR which they have yet to </p><p>fulfill.  (MOT for example heads the Market Management </p><p>Bureau, which has responsibility for ensuring that IPR </p><p>infringing products are not being sold in stores.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) In a highly unusual move, the Director of NOIP </p><p>gave several candid interviews to major newspapers and and </p><p>TV news programs this week, where he was publicly critical </p><p>of the decision. (Note:  We understand that the Director was </p><p>"called in" to speak to his superiors following the </p><p>appearance of the articles.) In both his public statements </p><p>and his private discussions with the Embassy, he was </p><p>distraught over the dismantling of an organization that he </p><p>personally, as well as many others, have worked so hard to </p><p>improve over the last few years. He cited the waste of human </p><p>and infrastructure resources and he despaired over the </p><p>effect on NOIP\'s modernization project. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  The changes put in jeopardy the extensive </p><p>investment international donors (particularly the Japanese </p><p>and the Swiss) have made in enhancing the capacity of NOIP. </p><p>(Note: Both the Swiss and the EU in their donor status </p><p>unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade the GVN from making </p><p>these changes.)  Currently, NOIP handles about 10,000 patent </p><p>and trademark applications every year. Through JICA, Japan </p><p>has been funding the "Modernization of Industrial Property </p><p>Management Project", a 4-year, $4 million project to </p><p>computerize the patent and trademark office.  The JICA </p><p>representative who is seconded to NOIP told Econ Counselor </p><p>that Tokyo has said the project was targeted to NOIP and </p><p>that no resources can be transferred to MOT. When trademark </p><p>registration goes, JICA can no longer provide any technical </p><p>or resource assistance on trademarks. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) A visiting regional IP lawyer based in Bangkok </p><p>briefed Econ Counselor on his meetings with the GVN, UNDP, </p><p>and other IPR experts in Hanoi.  He noted that the GVN </p><p>seemed oblivious to their international obligations to </p><p>accept, process, and enforce trademark applications and have </p><p>not notified WIPO. (Note: The Bilateral Trade Agreement </p><p>(BTA) also addresses Vietnam\'s obligation to register and </p><p>protect trademarks in Chapter II, Article 6.)  He </p><p>characterized the GVN plan to separate registration from the </p><p>rest of the trademark function as "insane."  He also </p><p>predicted that breaking out registration and trying to do it </p><p>in 15 days would only result in increased litigation, as </p><p>there is no way to do due diligence in the search, </p><p>examination and opposition requirements.  He also noted his </p><p>concern over the GVN position that plant varieties are "not </p><p>IPR." (Note:  In the BTA, although Vietnam may exclude some </p><p>plants and animal varieties from patentability, it must </p><p>protect them under the UPOV Convention.)  Finally, he noted </p><p>that although this was a problem for all trademark </p><p>holders/seekers, it was a more serious one for Vietnamese </p><p>businesses, who can\'t easily go abroad to register their </p><p>marks but have only a domestic option. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) From a different perspective though, one expat IP </p><p>attorney told Econoff he believed the change could be good </p><p>for the processing and enforcement of trademarks in Vietnam. </p><p>The attorney expressed a great deal of frustration with </p><p>NOIP\'s handling of trademarks and noted that perhaps MOT </p><p>would "take trademarks in a different direction" - something </p><p>that could ultimately be good for Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) COMMENT AND NEXT STEPS:  Embassy\'s attempts to </p><p>clarify the status with MOT have been unsuccessful, with our </p><p>contacts telling us that literally, no one knows. The big </p><p>question is why Vietnam would choose to reverse the progress </p><p>it has made to consolidate, modernize, and professionalize </p><p>its trademark and other IPR functions. And the </p><p>responsibility would be shifted to MOT, which is currently </p><p>unable to carry out the functions it already has as it </p><p>struggles with BTA implementation, WTO accession, and </p><p>implementation of numerous bilateral trade agreements, such </p><p>as textiles. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU)  If there is a greater policy strategy out there, </p><p>no one in the IPR community here has been able to discover </p><p>it.  Although we hesitate to draw the simplest conclusion, </p><p>i.e. follow the money and power, it may be the most accurate </p><p>in this case.  The Minister of Trade\'s star seems to be </p><p>rising, partly because of his tough stance with the U.S on </p><p>catfish and textiles, as well as the success for Vietnam of </p><p>the BTA.  Washington agencies will remember that the current </p><p>Minister of Trade negotiated the BTA and took a lot of </p><p>criticism for "giving away" too much.  Now, he can point to </p><p>the enormous increase in exports and take credit. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU) Econ Counselor met with local IPR experts and </p><p>other embassy reps to discuss possible next steps.  Few </p><p>believe that the Prime Minister\'s decision can be reversed </p><p>but Embassy believes that it can be modified or at least its </p><p>impact lessened (although it\'s not easy, we\'ve done it </p><p>before). Embassies agreed to take a concerted approach with </p><p>the GVN, registering our concern about the change, in </p><p>particular the effect on NOIP and Vietnam\'s ability to </p><p>manage trademarks, and outlining our expectations that </p><p>Vietnam fulfill its international obligations.  In addition, </p><p>we discussed recommending to the GVN in the future that they </p><p>assign overall coordinating responsibility for IPR to the </p><p>Office of the Government under the Prime Minister (OOG), in </p><p>the same manner that OOG coordinates BTA implementation. </p><p>END COMMENT AND NEXT STEPS. </p><p></p></div>
