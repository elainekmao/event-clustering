<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002044 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/05/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 28 (4/05 1000 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 2033 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) The Embassy is closed April 5 for the Jordanian </p><p>weekend.  It will reopen for regular business on Sunday, </p><p>April 6.  The movement of American staff remains restricted. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Nothing new to report. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Nothing new to report. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Demonstrations were held in Amman April 4.  Between </p><p>5,000 - 7,000 participants marched from a downtown mosque to </p><p>a GOJ municipal building in a licensed demonstration.  PSD </p><p>and embassy contacts report the march was spirited and full </p><p>of anti-USG and "pro-Saddam" slogans, but was peaceful.  In </p><p>the Shmeisani area, a few hundred people marched in a </p><p>licensed march from the professional associations complex to </p><p>the UN headquarters. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Nothing new to report. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Jordan-Iraq border remains open.  REFCOORD </p><p>visited Ruwayshid April 5 and reported 246 third country </p><p>nationals currently at the UNHCR camp.  8 TCNs crossed into </p><p>Jordan during the night of April 3-4 9 TCNs crossed during </p><p>the night of April 4-5. As of April 5, three Palestinian </p><p>families attempting to transit into Jordan were waiting at </p><p>the border as their documents are sorted out. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  UNHCR reports GOJ authorities continue to allow </p><p>Iraqis with onward airline tickets, valid visas and </p><p>"sufficient funds" to transit Jordan en route to other </p><p>countries.  Reportedly, a "handful" of Iraqis enter Jordan </p><p>daily under these circumstances.  In one case where an Iraqi </p><p>family wanted to stay in Jordan prior to transiting out, GOJ </p><p>authorities were reportedly willing to permit their entry so </p><p>long as they registered with UNHCR as asylum seekers and </p><p>stayed in the refugee camp.  In this case, the family </p><p>reportedly refused to register as refugees and were returned </p><p>to Iraq.  UNHCR says they are tracking such cases "very </p><p>closely." </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Embassy received a phone call during the evening </p><p>of April 4 from Kate Rowland of the Italy-based humanitarian </p><p>group "Emergency."  Rowland said that a group consisting of </p><p>five persons (including a surgeon, nurse, and </p><p>anesthesiologist) planned to travel from Amman to Baghdad </p><p>either Sunday April 6 or Monday April 7 in a convoy of two </p><p>large trucks and two trailers carrying medical supplies. </p><p>Rowland said the trucks and trailers will bear the </p><p>"Emergency" logo.  Embassy Crisis Liaison Unit conveyed this </p><p>information to Task Force West personnel in the Embassy and </p><p>to the PRM duty officer at TF1 in Washington.  Kate Rowland\'s </p><p>contact information in Amman is as follows:  Sheraton Hotel </p><p>(962-6-593-4111), room 419, or international cell number </p><p>00393358189598.  Rowland said she would pass on additional </p><p>information on the convoy\'s travel plans when they become </p><p>available.  Based on the information provided, it appears </p><p>there are no AMCITS traveling in this group. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The convoy of three to four GMC suburban-type vehicles </p><p>carrying journalists from various western news organizations </p><p>that set out from Amman for Baghdad the morning of April 4 </p><p>reportedly arrived in Baghdad late night April 4 (reftel A). </p><p>There are no AMCITS in the group.  The US military public </p><p>affairs officer detailed to Jordan is aware of the situation. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Rounding out the government\'s three-day effort to </p><p>align its public stance more closely with the feelings of an </p><p>angry nation, Jordan\'s state-owned and influenced media April </p><p>4 played up the PM\'s convoking of the Ambassador as evidence </p><p>that the GOJ is taking tangible and meaningful steps to </p><p>translate into action the people\'s </p><p>opposition to the war (reftel B).  Local reporting on the </p><p>event also highlighted the Ambassador\'s remarks to the press </p><p>expressing a common concern for the welfare of Iraqi </p><p>civilians and a commitment to maintain that concern even as </p><p>we pursue the objective of removing the Baathist regime. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
