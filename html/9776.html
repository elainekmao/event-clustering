GNEHM, REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is a joint Amman-Jerusalem-Tel Aviv cable. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The Aqaba summit and the Dead Sea WEF conference have </p><p>generated new hopes for expanded economic activity between </p><p>Jordan, Israel and -- to a lesser extent -- the West </p><p>Bank/Gaza.  Jordan is particularly emboldened by the recent </p><p>events on its soil.  Israeli sources are also upbeat, but </p><p>caution against overblown expectations.  The Palestinians, to </p><p>a large extent, remain focused on the present economic </p><p>hardships caused by the Israeli closure measures. </p><p> </p><p>Currently, we see movement, or possible future movement, on </p><p>several fronts.  These include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Jordan and Israel have already begun exploring </p><p>improvements to make QIZs, the core of bilateral economic </p><p>relations, more competitive. </p><p> </p><p>-- Although Jordan has expressed interest in establishing </p><p>cumulation agreements with future U.S. FTA partners Morocco </p><p>and Bahrain, it may be hesitant to embrace cumulation, or an </p><p>FTA, with Israel.  Israel would likely be open to both </p><p>cumulation and a "Jordan River Free Trade Area" as part of </p><p>its policy to use economic ties to improve the general </p><p>political relationship.  The Palestinians, who already have a </p><p>customs union with Israel and enjoy duty free trade with both </p><p>the U.S. and the EU, tend to see trade with Jordan as a </p><p>zero-sum game and are not necessarily keen on a FTA with the </p><p>Jordanians. </p><p> </p><p>-- Jordan hopes for cooperation in tourism, civil aviation, </p><p>and water management, but Israeli interest will be </p><p>conditional on meeting economic and security concerns. </p><p>Palestinians also see opportunities for the joint marketing </p><p>of tourist sites in the future. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Our continued support for greater economic integration </p><p>would be a low cost way to support roadmap implementation, </p><p>and ultimately to support greater regional stability through </p><p>increased intra-regional trade, along the lines of the </p><p>President\'s Middle East Trade Initiative (METI).  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Business Mood Improving </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The end of the war in Iraq and the beginnings of an </p><p>Israeli-Palestinian dialog have created new hopes of improved </p><p>economic relations between Jordan, Israel and the West </p><p>Bank/Gaza.  Optimism and hopes appear to be most pronounced </p><p>in Jordan.  In Israel, optimism is accompanied by caution </p><p>born out of the disappointments of the 1990s, when economic </p><p>realities and ultimately the Intifada destroyed any dreams of </p><p>a New Middle East.  While some in the Palestinian business </p><p>community are hopeful that progress on implementing the </p><p>roadmap will improve economic conditions in WB/G, they remain </p><p>focused on internal obstacles to commerce, such as roadblocks </p><p>and closures, as well as barriers to trade with Israel and </p><p>the outside world imposed by the GOI. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Pronounced Optimism in Jordan </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In Jordan, both the GOJ and Jordan\'s private sector </p><p>have been more upbeat on prospects for local and regional </p><p>economic growth (ref a).  GOJ trade and investment promotion </p><p>officials were particularly emboldened by the Aqaba summit </p><p>and the Dead Sea World Economic Forum (WEF) that followed it. </p><p> They have been thinking, and in some cases have started </p><p>active discussions with Israeli counterparts, about </p><p>mechanisms to increase opportunities under the QIZ </p><p>initiative, the FTA, bilateral agreements, and other areas of </p><p>technical cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>In Israel, Cautious Optimism </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Israeli officials, too, returned from the WEF upbeat. </p><p>For them, the public appearances with Jordanian officials and </p><p>the positive Jordanian statements about Israel were of </p><p>important symbolic value, since they demonstrated a Jordanian </p><p>commitment to openly acknowledge relations with Israel.  As a </p><p>whole, Israeli businessmen share this new mood.  Both </p><p>government and business contacts hope the new mood will lead </p><p>to improved person-to-person contacts on a small scale, with </p><p>trade and investment increasing as a result.  Invariably, our </p><p>interlocutors in Israel caution against overblown </p><p>expectations.  Israel\'s highly developed, export-oriented </p><p>economy is not "a natural fit" with the Arab world, we </p><p>repeatedly hear, and even in the most peaceful of worlds </p><p>Israeli trade with Arab countries would remain small compared </p><p>to Israeli trade with the highly industrialized economies of </p><p>the world.  In addition, Israelis are downbeat when </p><p>commenting about the prospects for large-scale cross-border </p><p>projects.  Many such projects conceived in the 1990s were </p><p>politically attractive but did not make economic sense, we </p><p>are constantly told. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>In WB/G, Other Worries </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Even during more promising times before the latest </p><p>Intifada, Palestinians engaged in little trade with Jordan, </p><p>and focused their efforts on improving economic relations </p><p>with Israel and promoting exports to the United States and </p><p>Europe.  The Jordanian and Palestinian economies are </p><p>competitive, not complementary, and Palestinians tend to </p><p>think of trade with Jordan as a zero-sum game. However, they </p><p>enjoy a comparative advantage in labor costs with Israel. </p><p>This, combined with physical proximity to Israel, the common </p><p>Israeli/Palestinian market, and the difficulties of getting </p><p>goods to Jordan due to tariffs, Israeli security measures and </p><p>other non-trade barriers, explains why trade and labor flows </p><p>with Israel have long dominated the Palestinian economy. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>QIZs </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) QIZs remain at the center of Jordanian/Israeli </p><p>economic relations.  At meetings at the Dead Sea, Jordanian </p><p>and Israeli trade ministers agreed to restructure the Israeli </p><p>input calculations for QIZ exports.  The GOJ and GOI are now </p><p>close to inking an agreement to move away from a straight 8 </p><p>percent content requirement and replace it with a "sliding </p><p>scale" (ref b).   The aim is to attract higher-value, more </p><p>diversified products into the QIZ scheme by reducing the </p><p>total Israeli content necessary for higher-value goods. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>"Cumulation Agreements" </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) At the WEF, then-Trade Minister Salah Bashir told </p><p>A/USTR Novelli of Jordan\'s interest in pursuing cumulation </p><p>arrangements with new U.S. FTA partners including Morocco </p><p>and, eventually, Bahrain (ref c).  Jordan has been open to </p><p>such agreements with the WB/G, but its willingness to pursue </p><p>cumulation with Israel has waned since the outbreak of the </p><p>Intifada.  On the other hand, we expect Israel to be open to </p><p>any overtures.  The Israelis would likely argue that any </p><p>cumulation agreements would need to encompass both Israel and </p><p>the WB/G due to the Israeli/Palestinian customs union.  The </p><p>USG has never canvassed Palestinian officials about the </p><p>notion of Palestinian/Jordanian cumulation. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) On a related note, the GOJ recently reached </p><p>agreement to allow Israeli cumulation for textile goods </p><p>exported to Europe under the Association Agreement.  This </p><p>essentially allows Jordan to apply the QIZ model to exports </p><p>to Europe, but is also a rare example of Jordan-Israel </p><p>cooperation outside the U.S. market context, and could set a </p><p>precedent for further cooperation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>A "Jordan River Free Trade Area"? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) In ref d, Embassy Tel Aviv suggested exploring the </p><p>possibility of merging our existing FTAs with Israel and </p><p>Jordan into a trilateral agreement.  We believe the GOI would </p><p>be open to examining such an initiative, since it would fit </p><p>in well with Israel\'s policy of using economic relations to </p><p>further political ties.  Israeli business interests would </p><p>likely support the idea, although many smaller companies </p><p>would probably fear the Jordanian competition.  GOI contacts </p><p>tell us that Jordan is not yet keen on the idea, although </p><p>King Abdullah did speak out publicly in favor of an FTA with </p><p>Israel at the WEF. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Palestinian officials and business leaders have </p><p>voiced rhetorical support for the concept of increasing </p><p>intra-Arab trade and economic cooperation, partially in an </p><p>emotional response to increased Israeli restrictions on </p><p>bilateral trade.  Indeed, some Arab countries - albeit not </p><p>Jordan - have lowered or eliminated tariffs on exports from </p><p>the WB/G in an effort to aid the Palestinian economy, and a </p><p>limited number of Palestinians have taken advantage of this </p><p>largess.  But for the same reasons that intra-Arab trade is </p><p>so marginal, short-term opportunities for greater Palestinian </p><p>trade with Jordan and the Arab world remain extremely </p><p>limited.  Considering the similarity of the Palestinian and </p><p>Jordanian economies, the Palestinians will likely continue to </p><p>focus on developing trade with other non-Arab partners. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs):  Security Concerns </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Although bilateral trade has grown rapidly thanks to </p><p>the QIZs, important problems remain.  GOJ officials have said </p><p>repeatedly since the beginning of the Intifada that Jordanian </p><p>products are under-represented in the Palestinian and </p><p>Israeli-Arab markets.  They note that Jordanian products </p><p>traditionally sold well in these markets in the past.  The </p><p>GOJ says Israeli labeling and "back-to-back" shipping </p><p>requirements as well as periodic restrictions to cargo access </p><p>into/out of the West Bank have all combined to keep Jordanian </p><p>products out of "natural" markets in northern Israel and the </p><p>WB/G.   Israeli government officials say they are aware of </p><p>these concerns, but say any delays are purely security </p><p>related.  They have indicated little willingness to move on </p><p>the Jordanian wishes.  Palestinians argue that Jordanian </p><p>products are in low demand in the WB/G because their quality </p><p>is poor compared to the Israeli and domestically produced </p><p>goods that dominate their market. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>NTBs: Strike-related delays </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) The GOJ says the Israeli customs and port strikes in </p><p>spring 2003 did far more damage to QIZ exports and future </p><p>orders than the war being conducted in Iraq at the same time. </p><p> The GOJ now hopes for some sort of Israeli "national </p><p>security" exemption in the event of future strikes.  The GOI </p><p>tells us it tried to accommodate the QIZ goods by creating an </p><p>interagency committee to respond to Jordanian requests during </p><p>the strike.  They seem unwilling, however, to </p><p>institutionalize any sort of special treatment for QIZ goods. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>NTBs: Informal Boycotts </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) From the Israeli perspective, alleged latent </p><p>discrimination and outright boycotts of Israeli goods and/or </p><p>businessmen are the main NTB with Jordan.  In particular, the </p><p>GOI is angry at the Jordanian lawyers\' union refusal to </p><p>represent Israeli businessmen.  In effect, this boycott means </p><p>that Israeli businessmen cannot expect to enforce contracts </p><p>in Jordan.  With the help of offshore companies and Jordanian </p><p>partners, Israeli business interests are now learning to live </p><p>with this problem. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Red Sea Partners: Jordanian Hopes </p><p>and Israeli Reality </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU)  Various proposals have been floated to utilize </p><p>Aqaba airport to serve both Eilat and Aqaba.  The Aqaba </p><p>airport\'s close proximity to the border could be exploited to </p><p>create dual immigration, customs and security control points. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) As politically attractive as these ideas may sound, </p><p>they have collided with the political and economic realities </p><p>of the region.  Most importantly, Israel is worried about </p><p>losing jobs to Jordan if Eilat airport is closed.  The plan </p><p>has suffered from the deteriorated political environment </p><p>caused by the Intifada, as well as from Israeli environmental </p><p>concerns and Jordanian questions about sovereignty issues. </p><p>Israeli officials say the airport idea is not yet dead, </p><p>although they do admit that a proposal is being floated to </p><p>build a new airport for Eilat on Israeli soil. </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) An agreement allowing several hundred Jordanian </p><p>workers into Eilat to work at day jobs, mostly in </p><p>construction, has been a success in the eyes of the GOI.  A </p><p>further Israeli proposal to repeat the scheme farther north, </p><p>in the Arava valley, reportedly found no support with the </p><p>GOJ, which feared that Israel may have sought to replace </p><p>Palestinian workers shut out of Israel by GOI security </p><p>measures. </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) Opportunities in Iraq may be a further catalyst for </p><p>intensifying economic ties across the Jordan River. </p><p>Government officials, businessmen and NGOs have all </p><p>approached Embassy Tel Aviv in recent weeks about selling </p><p>Israeli products to Iraq via Jordanian intermediaries.  Post </p><p>has alerted these parties to contact addresses for Iraq </p><p>reconstruction, and has helped them network among themselves. </p><p> Post knows of at least one case where Jordanian and Israeli </p><p>business interests are actively negotiating with Iraqis over </p><p>the delivery of Israeli goods and services. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Tourism </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) Should violence in the region recede, </p><p>Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation could help revive </p><p>the flagging tourism sector.  A substantial increase in </p><p>cross-border traffic between Aqaba-Eilat and East </p><p>Bank-Jerusalem, which has dropped to the single digits when </p><p>measured in terms of tourists per day, would energize the </p><p>currently-depressed sector on both sides of the Jordan River. </p><p> Regional officials in Israel have suggested opening a new </p><p>border crossing in the Arava valley that would dramatically </p><p>reduce the travel time from Israel to Petra, and hence </p><p>increase the number of tourists to Jordan\'s prime historical </p><p>treasure.  The Jordanians reportedly balked, fearing that an </p><p>increase in day tourists would have a negative impact on </p><p>Jordanian hotels at Petra.  Palestinians are also </p><p>enthusiastic about the joint marketing of regional tourism </p><p>opportunities.  At the same time, Palestinian tourism </p><p>operators often complain that Israel engages in unfair </p><p>practices that serve to encourage tourists visiting Jerusalem </p><p>to spend their money in (Israeli) West Jerusalem, rather than </p><p>in (Arab) East Jerusalem or Palestinian tourist centers such </p><p>as Bethlehem. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Read Dead Redux </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) An ambitious and controversial plan to save the </p><p>Dead Sea by building a canal linking the Red Sea to the Dead </p><p>Sea has been re-energized by efforts beginning at the 2002 </p><p>World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, </p><p>followed up by the recent trilateral panel session at the WEF </p><p>(ref e), the first-ever public meeting of Israeli, Jordanian </p><p>and Palestinian representatives to discuss the project.  The </p><p>WEF panel did not directly address the $10-13 million cost of </p><p>a comprehensive feasibility study.  Only the Jordanian </p><p>Minister of Water and Irrigation hinted at the $1-2 billion </p><p>needed for the initial phase of the expected $5-6 billion </p><p>project, which, in its entirety, proposes recharging the </p><p>evaporating Dead Sea, generating hydro-electric power, </p><p>desalinating Red Sea water, and conveying potable water to </p><p>urban centers.  The project is widely viewed as being more </p><p>about water and regional cooperation than environmental </p><p>protection, and environmentalists and hydrologists are still </p><p>carefully examining the ecological consequences of mixing the </p><p>seas.   The GOI is cautious about the project, only saying </p><p>that it would greet a feasibility study while stressing that </p><p>it will not help pay for it. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>22. (C) The trade and technical cooperation opportunities </p><p>outlined above could be a catalyst for progress both on the </p><p>roadmap and on the President\'s METI agenda.  We will continue </p><p>to support local efforts to boost multilateral trade in the </p><p>region, and to promote joint marketing of tourism in the Holy </p><p>Land.  Actions can include supporting the QIZ initiative, </p><p>exploring, under Washington\'s guidance, the possibility of </p><p>establishing cumulation agreements and an FTA, facilitating </p><p>bilateral discussions to remove or soften trade barriers, and </p><p>supporting US trade and investment delegations to the region </p><p>and to future Fora like the WEF.  We also believe that a </p><p>high-level USG visit aimed at explaining and promoting the </p><p>METI would help us maintain the momentum and capitalize on </p><p>the current mood of optimism.  We welcome Washington agency </p><p>input on how we can contribute to strengthening the efforts </p><p>that are currently underway in the region. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
