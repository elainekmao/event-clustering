<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001564 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARLY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ANOTHTER MEDIA TRIAL BEGINS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The trial for independent "Daily News" reporter </p><p>      Lloyd Mudiwa, charged with violating the country\'s </p><p>      controversial Access to Information and Protection of </p><p>      Privacy Act (AIPPA), opens in Harare on June 20. </p><p>      Mudiwa is accused of having abused journalistic </p><p>      privilege by reporting false information.  His trial </p><p>      comes hard on the heels of Andrew Meldrum\'s trial that </p><p>      opened in Harare last week, also facing similar </p><p>      charges.  Meldrum, an U.S. national writing for </p><p>      Britain\'s "Guardian" newspaper, reproduced an article </p><p>      by Lloyd Mudiwa carried in the "Daily News" newspaper </p><p>      in April about a "beheaded woman."  The story has since </p><p>      been disproved. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Meanwhile, Andrew Meldrum, the first journalist to </p><p>      be tried under AIPPA, yesterday sought High Court </p><p>      permission to have his case referred to the Supreme </p><p>      Court of Zimbabwe as a constitutional matter.  He is </p><p>      challenging the constitutionality of AIPPA.  Yesterday </p><p>      the magistrate reserved judgment on the application, </p><p>      saying she needed time to examine the documents filed </p><p>      by Meldrum before making a ruling. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   In the meantime, journalists from Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>      private media this week vowed to defy a requirement </p><p>      that they register under a government-appointed media </p><p>      commission.  According to an article carried in the </p><p>      June 20 edition of the independent weekly "The </p><p>      Financial Gazette," members of the Independent </p><p>      Journalists Association of Zimbabwe (IAJ) resolved not </p><p>      to comply with the Media Commission requirements that </p><p>      journalists apply for accreditation.  Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>      journalists and media houses were given until June 16 </p><p>      to accredit or register with the Mahoso commission or </p><p>      risk being prosecuted for violating AIPPA provisions. </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Under headline "Zimbabwe journalism goes on trial </p><p>      today," the independent daily "The Daily News" </p><p>      dedicated its June 20 editorial to the significance of </p><p>      the Mudiwa trial. </p><p> </p><p>      "Today, our reporter Lloyd Mudiwa appears in </p><p>      court, charged under the AIPPA.  It is `The </p><p>      Daily News\' on trial. . .  The result, either </p><p>      way, will set a precedent with a potential to </p><p>      change the manner in which we speak or speak out </p><p>      against anything in our beleaguered country. . . </p><p>      The consequences of Mudiwa\'s case, preceded by </p><p>      that of Andrew Meldrum. . . are set to resonate </p><p>      beyond our borders.  They threaten to change the </p><p>      face of our journalism." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
