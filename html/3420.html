<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 002268 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 07/30/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MASS, MOPS, TP, CM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: A/S KANSTEINER MEETING WITH </p><p>BATAGARAWA </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  During a July 24 meeting with </p><p>Minister of State For Defense (Army) Lawal Batagarawa, </p><p>A/S Kansteiner raised the inquiry into the 2001 Benue </p><p>state massacre, the recent legislative hold on WASP </p><p>funding, the Army\'s response to violence in Plateau </p><p>State that has claimed a soldier and police officer, </p><p>and prospects for violence in the upcoming elections. </p><p>Batagarawa requested USG help to defuse potential </p><p>trouble in Bakassi, assistance on debt relief and more </p><p>police training.  In attendance at the meeting were </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, Kansteiner Senior Special Advisor </p><p>Jim Dunlop, Political Counselor, Pol/Mil officer and </p><p>DATT (notetaker).   End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>BENUE INQUIRY -- NEED FOR PROGRESS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) A/S Kansteiner met Minister of State for </p><p>Defense (Army) Lawal Batagarawa at the Ambassador\'s </p><p>residence on the evening of 24 July, after his arrival </p><p>from Libreville. A/S Kansteiner informed Batagarawa of </p><p>Senator Feingold\'s decision to place a legislative </p><p>hold on the proposed $2m program for post-Operation </p><p>Focus Relief (OFR) sustainment for the five US-trained </p><p>Nigerian peacekeeping battalions.  The legislative </p><p>action was prompted by the apparent lack of progress </p><p>in the inquiry into the army massacre of civilians in </p><p>Benue State last October.  Kansteiner added that the </p><p>Commission seemed dilatory and its proceedings </p><p>appeared to be open-ended.  He asked when the </p><p>proceedings would close. The Ambassador raised </p><p>concerns about the credibility of the Commission, </p><p>noting he was troubled by the delay in the Commission </p><p>actually going to the troubled areas to gather </p><p>evidence from local sources and people who could not </p><p>travel to Abuja.  He also cited the Commission\'s lack </p><p>of prosecutorial power as a concern. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Batagarawa responded that the lack of funding </p><p>delayed the initial start of the inquiry (Funding also </p><p>affected the start of a separate military </p><p>investigation on the events.)  The shift of the </p><p>Commission from Abuja to the locus of the violence was </p><p>also impeded by lack of money.  He agreed that the </p><p>Commission needed to visit the affected areas to give </p><p>the numbers of poor people who cannot to travel to </p><p>Abuja a chance to be heard and provide evidence. </p><p>Additionally, travel by the Commission would give its </p><p>members an opportunity to see first hand the sites of </p><p>violence. Constitutionally the Commission could not </p><p>have prosecutorial powers Batagarawa noted, but its </p><p>findings would be referred to the appropriate </p><p>authorities, including the Justice Ministry.  The </p><p>facts gathered could be used as evidence at trial. </p><p>Batagarawa stated that the internal army inquiry would </p><p>take place but would never be made public; however, he </p><p>offered to privately brief the Embassy and/or Senator </p><p>Feingold on its findings. A/S Kansteiner noted that </p><p>the in-house investigation and briefing of USG </p><p>officials would be helpful. Batagarawa volunteered to </p><p>travel to the U.S. in August to meet Senator Feingold </p><p>to discuss the status of the investigation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>NIGERIAN CONCERNS-BAKASSI IS NUMBER ONE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) Minister Batagarawa expressed deep concern </p><p>about the Bakassi peninsula.  The GON expected a </p><p>decision by the ICJ any time after September and </p><p>thought it would go against Nigeria. He pointed out </p><p>the difficult position the GON would be in </p><p>politically, particularly in the run-up to elections. </p><p>The GON needed a way out.  "We don\'t want to go to </p><p>war.  It would be bad for us, undermining our </p><p>credibility as a peacekeeper in the region."  He </p><p>agreed with Ambassador Jeter\'s assessment that it </p><p>would also destabilize the region.  The GON wanted to </p><p>negotiate a political solution in advance of the </p><p>decision, but Cameroon appeared disinterested. </p><p>President Obasanjo had made three separate attempts to </p><p>talk with Cameroon\'s Biya, but the latter rebuffed </p><p>Obasanjo each time.  The Minister added that the GON </p><p>requested French President Chirac\'s assistance as an </p><p>intermediary.  Chirac was unhelpful, stating there was </p><p>nothing he could do since he had little influence on </p><p>Biya. </p><p>5.  (S) A/S Kansteiner replied that dialogue with </p><p>Cameroon was crucial, and needed to occur before the </p><p>ICJ decision.  Afterwards, he said, the winner of the </p><p>judgment would not have any incentive to talk.  The </p><p>A/S offered U.S. assistance in conveying messages to </p><p>the Cameroonians, but assessed our influence as much </p><p>less than that of the French. The Ambassador noted </p><p>that much of this problem was personality driven, as </p><p>Biya purposefully isolated himself and was intractable </p><p>and stubborn.  (Note: This assertion was based on the </p><p>French Ambassador\'s and the GOF\'s assessment of Biya.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>OTHER POSSIBLE MILITARY VIOLENCE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The Minister stated he had no information </p><p>outside of press accounts about the reported killing </p><p>of Sierra Leonean civilians by Nigerian peacekeepers </p><p>in Freetown.  Regarding the continuing violence in </p><p>Plateau State and threats by military officers to </p><p>avenge the killings of a soldier there, the Minister </p><p>assured A/S Kansteiner that there would be no heavy- </p><p>handed response.  Both A/S Kansteiner and the </p><p>Ambassador emphasized that an overzealous, </p><p>unrestrained response by the military would </p><p>essentially seal the fate of USG military cooperation </p><p>with Nigeria.  The Minister explained the situation </p><p>had escalated beyond the police\'s ability to control, </p><p>requiring the military to restore order.  In fact, the </p><p>Minister stated that the publicized military threat </p><p>had been taken out of context by a journalist covering </p><p>a meeting designed to help restore calm to the area. </p><p>The journalist had been thrown out of the meeting and </p><p>retaliated by writing a negative story.  The Minister </p><p>noted that curbing the growth of armed banditry in the </p><p>area necessitated highly visible military maneuvers </p><p>and expressed concern about how such movements would </p><p>be exploited by an often irresponsible media. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment: Security forces report groups of </p><p>violent bandits roving in Plateau and neighboring </p><p>states all the way to the Chadian border. There was a </p><p>recent firefight between army units and criminals in </p><p>northern Plateau State during which several bandits </p><p>were allegedly killed. However, the recent spike in </p><p>violence in Plateau cannot all be attributed to </p><p>criminality. Most of the recent violence has been </p><p>communal or election-related. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ELECTIONS "ARE HEATING UP" </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Responding to A/S Kansteiner\'s question about </p><p>the election season, the Minister stated that things </p><p>were hot even though the season had not entered full </p><p>swing.  Regarding electoral violence, he said he was </p><p>most concerned about the Southeast, where the spirit </p><p>of compromise is almost nonexistent and there is no </p><p>strong traditional social hierarchy to control the </p><p>parties.  Batagarawa also expressed concerned about </p><p>parts of the Southwest and South-South (citing the </p><p>Chevron facility seizure) as well as Plateau State in </p><p>the Middle Belt. He added that he was much less </p><p>concerned with the rest of the Middle Belt or the </p><p>North. The Ambassador noted holding local government </p><p>elections on August 10 was logistically impossible, </p><p>and that November-December was a more realistic time- </p><p>frame.  The Ambassador also predicted that significant </p><p>violence could be expected for the gubernatorial </p><p>elections.  The Minister concurred with both </p><p>assessments. (Comment: Batagarawa was very concerned </p><p>about electoral violence because he knows all too well </p><p>that the army will be summoned to stem outbreaks </p><p>because the police have proven incapable. End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Debt Relief Once Again </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) The Minister asked about debt relief for </p><p>Nigeria, noting its importance to the economy. A/S </p><p>Kansteiner replied there was very little chance for </p><p>debt relief now; its eventuality would depend on the </p><p>GON reaching agreement with the IMF and sustaining </p><p>economic reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>More Help With Police Reform </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Minister requested increased USG </p><p>assistance in building an effective police force.  His </p><p>concern was that police ineffectiveness to contain </p><p>communal violence forced the military to intervene in </p><p>domestic security issues, increasing the potential for </p><p>the army to be accused of the excessive use of force. </p><p>He observed the police system currently allowed </p><p>officers with almost no training to rise to a high </p><p>rank, and that there was no vetting. This meant "bad </p><p>men" could enter the force with the expectation of </p><p>reaching its senior levels. Police ineffectiveness was </p><p>a systemic problem in need of a "MPRI"-style approach </p><p>to establish a training base and schools. He thought </p><p>the one full-time American slated to work in the </p><p>police headquarters as an advisor would be inadequate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The Ambassador pointed out that the full time </p><p>position was created solely to work on developing a </p><p>police training curriculum, to replace the </p><p>approximately sixty year old program currently being </p><p>used.  He highlighted the problems we had to overcome </p><p>to start this program, citing police resistance to the </p><p>USG advisor having an office in police headquarters </p><p>and to the location of a national information database </p><p>at the headquarters. Batagarawa surmised the police </p><p>were afraid the USG would use the advisor and the </p><p>database "to spy" on them. The Ambassador noted that </p><p>establishing a viable curriculum to train the force </p><p>was a critical first step to reforming the police. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) A/S Kansteiner mentioned the Department had </p><p>earmarked an additional five million dollars for </p><p>police reform for Nigeria and stressed this was an </p><p>important indication of our commitment to help with </p><p>Nigerian police reform, given our usual policy </p><p>reluctance toward providing police reform assistance. </p><p>He added that we anticipate the money being available </p><p>in four or five months; down the road a new survey of </p><p>the overall police system and an action plan for its </p><p>improvement might be considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Ronco Support </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) The Ambassador raised the issue of assistance </p><p>to the Ronco team working the clean-up of the Ikeja </p><p>ammunition transfer depot explosion. The Minister had </p><p>received Ronco\'s letter enumerating support </p><p>requirements; he stated the requests would be met </p><p>completely. He also accepted the Ambassador\'s </p><p>invitation to visit the site, noting they could also </p><p>visit the Oshodi resettlement center.  (Note: The trip </p><p>is now planned for August 2.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Sao Tome Patrol Boat </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) A/S Kansteiner told Batagarawa that, while in </p><p>Libreville, he was informed Sao Tome\'s lone patrol </p><p>boat reportedly had been hijacked to Nigeria by </p><p>"pirates."  The Assistant Secretary asked the Minster </p><p>about the existence of a defense cooperation agreement </p><p>between Nigeria and Sao Tome and whether Nigerian </p><p>troops were stationed there.  The Minister was not </p><p>aware of the stolen patrol boat.  He added that it was </p><p>unlikely Nigerian troops were already stationed in Sao </p><p>Tome because he thought the cooperation agreement had </p><p>not been formally concluded. He qualified his </p><p>statement, however, noting his knowledge may not be </p><p>current but that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had </p><p>the lead on this issue and could provide an accurate </p><p>update. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (S) The Minister of State for the Army is our </p><p>closest and most effective interlocutor at the </p><p>Ministry of Defense.  He has become the main GON </p><p>interlocutor on the Benue inquiry. Regarding Benue, we </p><p>underscored the seriousness of a credible </p><p>investigation and we believe Batagarawa fully </p><p>understands our position. In addition to our pressing </p><p>him on Benue, the Army Minister has two other very </p><p>serious potential concerns that may fall into his and </p><p>the army\'s lap -- security for elections and Bakassi. </p><p>On these and numerous other issues, we believe </p><p>Batagarawa has the ear of the President. They probably </p><p>discussed how to broach the sensitive issue of Bakassi </p><p>with us. Batagarawa knew A/S Kansteiner would meet </p><p>President Obasanjo. Batagarawa\'s discussion on the </p><p>Bakassi was likely a primer for the subsequent </p><p>Obasanjo-Kansteiner meeting (Septel.) Obasanjo might </p><p>have wanted an indication of our position before </p><p>deciding whether to raise it with the Assistant </p><p>Secretary. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
