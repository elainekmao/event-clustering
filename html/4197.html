<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003014 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, EFIN, ENRG, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: DESPITE UNTAPPED DAM, GOMBE STATE </p><p>MOVING SLOWLY FORWARD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: During an October 4-6 visit to </p><p>Gombe State, Ambassador Jeter surveyed Gombe\'s </p><p>power, water, education and health sectors with </p><p>Gombe State officials, in the course of a second Ambassadorial </p><p>foray to the Northeast.  With its agricultural </p><p>potential and good hydroelectric promise, Nigeria\'s </p><p>14-year old Dadinkowa Dam sadly remains unused </p><p>because the GON never completed the project\'s final </p><p>stages.  Gombe State is keen on finishing the GON- </p><p>owned dam (Nigeria\'s second largest), but has not </p><p>identified funding sources or investors.  While </p><p>completing a much-needed small water supply system, </p><p>the State\'s larger unfinished water project may soon </p><p>stagnate because of lack of funding. Since assuming </p><p>office in 1999, Gombe\'s Governor Hashidu has </p><p>improved his state\'s water supply, rural </p><p>electrification, and security. Hashidu is well </p><p>positioned to win re-election in 2003, but will then </p><p>have an uphill battle funding his more ambitious </p><p>projects. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>AGRICULTURE DEPENDENT </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by Econoff, </p><p>Staff Assistant, and EDDI Coordinator, visited Gombe </p><p>State (Northeast region) on October 4-6.  With over </p><p>80% of the State\'s population agrarian, Gombe\'s </p><p>economy is hamstrung by years of neglect of the </p><p>agriculture sector under military and civilian rule. </p><p>Situated in Nigeria\'s Savannah region, agriculture </p><p>production and revenue suffer from unpredictable </p><p>rainfalls and poor farm-to-market roads. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>DAM\'S POTENTIAL UNTAPPED </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Ambassdor Jeter visited Gombe\'s Dadinkawo </p><p>Dam on October 5 with state Water Commission </p><p>Executive Director Jamrlu Ishiyaku Gwamna. Operated </p><p>by the Federal Government\'s Upper Benue River Basin </p><p>Development Authority, Dadinkowa Dam is Nigeria\'s </p><p>second largest. The dam was originally planned to </p><p>furnish hydroelectric power and water to 66,000 </p><p>hectares of farmland.  However, the dam produces no </p><p>power and only irrigates 50-100 hectares through a </p><p>heavily silted 3-mile canal system. The canals, </p><p>originally designed to be 5 miles long, have never </p><p>been used for their original purpose.  The GON-owned </p><p>Dadinkowa was never fully operational because past </p><p>military regimes misappropriated money or never </p><p>funded installation of the turbines needed to </p><p>generate power for hydroelectricity and irrigation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>UNTAPPED POTENTIAL </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The GON announced in August 2001 that it </p><p>would allocate USD 32 million to refurbish </p><p>Dadinkowa. Abuja-based political opponents of </p><p>Governor Abubakar Hashidu however blocked the </p><p>funding, according to an Embassy source. A Gombe </p><p>State official told Econoff that they did not expect </p><p>any GON financing, Gombe now sought an Individual </p><p>Power Project (IPP) investor to install turbines, </p><p>establish a power grid, and sell electricity to a </p><p>local cement plant, light industries and consumers </p><p>in Gombe City. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) COMMENT: Navigating the bureaucratic maze </p><p>to get all the relevant GON agencies and offices to </p><p>agree to an IPP could be a difficult but not </p><p>impossible task.   Also, Gombe will have to figure </p><p>out how the IPP could tie into NEPA lines and how it </p><p>will fit in with plans for NEPA\'s eventual </p><p>privatization. An U.S.-based consulting firm, which </p><p>hopes to broker a deal to equip Dadinkawo, has </p><p>informed Econoff that General Electric (GE) Hydro </p><p>will visit Gombe next month to assess the viability </p><p>of the State Government\'s plan. END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The dam\'s design calls for installation of </p><p>2 turbines, 2 water cooled generators, a switch </p><p>yard, and 5 km transmission line to connect into </p><p>NEPA lines. It is estimated that the dam could </p><p>produce 34 MV of electricity. The cost to complete </p><p>Dadinkowa\'s power plant is approximately USD 30 </p><p>million. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>LONG-TERM WATER CONCERNS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The Ambassador and party also visited </p><p>Gombe State\'s proposed USD 65.5 million regional </p><p>water supply system under construction by the </p><p>Pakistani engineering firm Shaukat and Raza. The </p><p>regional scheme, which takes its supply from </p><p>Dadinkowa and designed to provide service to 11 </p><p>towns, has only reached 30% completion since </p><p>construction started in 1999.  Gwamna said the State </p><p>had financed the entire project until now, and hoped </p><p>to receive at least 10% from local governments.  He </p><p>was unsure whether the 30% due from the GON would be </p><p>forthcoming this year.  He added that the State </p><p>Government was paying just enough to keep the </p><p>contractors working, and would provide additional </p><p>funding in the future.  Even when the project is </p><p>completed, the state was not sure how it would </p><p>collect fees-for-service to keep the system </p><p>operating. (COMMENT: Like Dadinkawo Dam, this </p><p>ambitious water scheme remains unfinished. If the </p><p>GON does not furnish its 30% share or Gombe State is </p><p>unable to fund the entire project, the Pakistani </p><p>contractors may depart, leaving another costly </p><p>opportunity missed.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Ambassador also visited a new USD 5 </p><p>million 13-borehole deep water supply system.  Paid </p><p>for by the State Government and built by a Chinese </p><p>company subsidized by Beijing, the system supplies </p><p>about 40% of Gombe\'s capital city\'s water. (COMMENT: </p><p>Water scarcity will remain a problem for developing </p><p>Northeast towns like Gombe City. If Dadinkawo Dam is </p><p>not used as a water source, water scarcity will </p><p>hinder the capital city\'s economic development. END </p><p>COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Gombe\'s Commissioner for Education Dr. </p><p>Habu Dahiru briefed the Ambassador on the State\'s </p><p>campaign to enroll new students, noting that </p><p>enrollment has increased three-fold since 1999. </p><p>Dahiru stressed that, like most of Nigeria, the </p><p>State lacks classrooms and trained teachers.  The </p><p>Ambassador also visited a local health clinic where </p><p>Gombe had established an HIV/AIDS testing and </p><p>counseling facility, and an incubation facility for </p><p>day-old chicks which is going some way to satisfy </p><p>the growing demand for poultry in the State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) With growing school class sizes and </p><p>decrepit health clinics, Gombe State is hard pressed </p><p>to maintain its modest facilities without major </p><p>federal government intervention and investments. </p><p>Governor Hashidu has made some progress, providing </p><p>citizens improved drinking water, rural </p><p>electrification, and relative security for rural </p><p>residents, particularly the farmers who, for years, </p><p>were subjected to the armed cattle raiders and </p><p>banditry from marauding gangs.  Hashidu, who has a </p><p>strong chance of winning re-election in 2003, will </p><p>have an uphill battle finding investors to complete </p><p>Dadinkowa or finance his large water project. </p><p>Overall, however, the Gombe State Government is well </p><p>run and Hashidu is providing strong and honest </p><p>leadership.
