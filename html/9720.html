On his return from Washington, Gul said </p><p>that the US request for Turkish troops would be discussed </p><p>with the General Staff, but noted that the government will </p><p>make the final decision.  Sunday\'s Cumhuriyet, on the other </p><p>hand, reports that the military will make the final </p><p>decision.  It remains unclear whether the issue will be </p><p>discussed in parliament before the summer recess, scheduled </p><p>to begin August 1.  "Milliyet" predicts that a decision on </p><p>troops would  probably be delayed until September. </p><p>Following the FM\'s comments that the government would </p><p>consult the military before making a decision, the General </p><p>Staff tasked Lt.Gen. Koksal Karabay to prepare a risk </p><p>assessment for Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gul Visits US:  Today\'s "Milliyet" reports that the US </p><p>welcomed the messages given by Turkish FM Gul during his </p><p>visit to Washington.  According to the story, US officials </p><p>said they had `not heard such positive messages since the </p><p>death of Ozal.\'  Gul reportedly highlighted the government\'s </p><p>determination to establish a civilian political system, to </p><p>end the special military status in Iraq, and AKP\'s </p><p>determination to act in parallel with American values in </p><p>contrast to growing anti-American sentiments in Turkey. </p><p>Weekend papers also report that Gul met with DepSecDef </p><p>Wolfowitz at a farewell dinner in the Turkish Embassy and </p><p>had breakfast with A/S Marc Grossman before he left </p><p>Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Visit of Syrian Prime Minister Mustafa Miro:  Today\'s </p><p>"Hurriyet" draws attention to the positive messages of the </p><p>Syrian Prime Minister before his official visit to Turkey </p><p>tomorrow.  PM Mustafa Miro will be the first Syrian PM to </p><p>visit Turkey in the last 17 years.   "Hurriyet" predicts </p><p>that Miro will support an end to Turkish-Syrian tensions </p><p>over the PKK, water issues, and territorial claims.  Miro </p><p>will reinforce Syria\'s acceptance of Turkey\'s unitary </p><p>structure and reiterate the importance of Syrian-Turkish </p><p>relations.  Miro will also stress that improved ties with </p><p>Turkey are not intended as a challenge to the US.  In an </p><p>interview with Islamist-oriented "Yeni Safak," Miro said </p><p>that the Turkish government is `meeting our expectations </p><p>about Iraq.\'  Like Turkey, he said, Syria favors a stronger </p><p>UN role in the Iraq process.\'  Turkey and Syria are expected </p><p>to sign several political and economic agreements during the </p><p>visit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Repentance Law: "Yeni Safak" reports that the repentance law </p><p>will be re-debated in the parliament this week.  330 votes </p><p>are required to pass the draft.  Sunday\'s "Radikal" reported </p><p>that before the voting session, the draft will be explained </p><p>to AKP deputies in detail, and they will be urged to give </p><p>their full support. </p><p>7th Harmonization Package: Sunday\'s "Radikal" reports that </p><p>the 7th EU harmonization package will be discussed in the </p><p>parliament\'s justice committee today and will be sent to the </p><p>full parliament for a vote on Wednesday.  The Government </p><p>hopes to pass the package this week, before the parliament </p><p>recess now scheduled to begin August 2. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Political messages given by Gul" </p><p>Yasemin Congar observed in mass appeal Milliyet (7/28): </p><p>"U.S. officials, concerned about rising anti-American </p><p>sentiment in Turkey, complained to FM Gul that the AKP has </p><p>not given the Turkish nation a consistent message about the </p><p>joint interests of the U.S. and Turkey.  Gul assured the </p><p>U.S. side that the political line of AKP overlaps with </p><p>American values. .  Gul believes anti-Americanism is linked </p><p>to the spread of extreme nationalism, pointing to a threat </p><p>of rising national socialism in Turkey.  Like Gul, the </p><p>Americans believe that the CHP is feeding this rise in </p><p>nationalism.  Americans following Turkish politics hold </p><p>increasingly negative views of the CHP. .  Gul told </p><p>Wolfowitz in detail about the AKP concept of a `modern </p><p>Muslim political identity.\' .  He believes that an </p><p>`authentic and reformist\' political line can be an impetus </p><p>for change in Muslim countries." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Different views" </p><p>Asli Aydintasbas wrote in mass appeal Sabah: "Although </p><p>Turkey is not a significant priority of U.S. foreign policy </p><p>anymore, Gul\'s U.S. visit can be considered successful. . </p><p>Despite all the tension and disappointment in the </p><p>relationship, Cheney, Rumsfeld and other U.S. officials </p><p>established a very positive dialogue with Gul. .  U.S. </p><p>officials repeatedly voiced their request for Turkish troops </p><p>for a stability force in Iraq.  But they make it clear that </p><p>the U.S. side won\'t be engaging in a long negotiation </p><p>process as seen in the handling of the March 1 decree. . </p><p>Ankara might naturally win some concessions from the </p><p>Americans.  However, Ankara\'s hand is not strong enough to </p><p>impose conditions such as a Turkish deputy being assigned to </p><p>Bremer, influence on the form of the new Iraqi constitution, </p><p>or the disarmament of the Kurds. .  If Ankara wants to be in </p><p>the Iraqi equation, it must put forth swift and attainable </p><p>demands." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
