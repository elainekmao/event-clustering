<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HAVANA 06412 </p><p> </p><p>CINCLANT FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CU </p><p>SUBJECT:  CASTRO PROJECTING IMAGE OF OPTIMISM </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  A RECURRING THEME IN FIDEL CASTRO\'S </p><p>SPEECHES SINCE THE END OF THE OCHOA/ABRANTES </p><p>SCANDALS LAST SUMMER HAS BEEN THAT THE </p><p>TRAUMA HAS STRENGTHENED THE GOC RATHER THAN </p><p>WEAKENED IT.  KEEPING A HEAVY SCHEDULE OF VISITS </p><p>TO CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL SITES IN HAVANA </p><p>AND CENTRAL CUBA, HE HAS CLAIMED THAT CUBA </p><p>IS MAKING GREAT STRIDES TOWARD "DOING MORE WITH </p><p>LESS" AND REMEDYING ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  HE </p><p>AND THE PARTY-CONTROLLED PRESS HAVE ALSO </p><p>ENDEAVORED TO PORTRAY CUBA AS MUCH BETTER OFF </p><p>THAN THOSE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES EXPERIMENTING </p><p>WITH "UNWISE" POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS. </p><p>COUNTERING AN IMPRESSION OF ISOLATION IN THE </p><p>SOCIALIST WORLD, OFFICIAL MEDIA HAVE ALSO </p><p>BEEN STRESSING CUBA\'S CLOSE TIES TO GDR AND </p><p>CHINA.  THE JAWBONING WILL PROBABLY HAVE LIMITED </p><p>EFFECT ON PUBLIC ATTITUDES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>3.  FIDEL CASTRO HAS MADE, EVEN FOR HIM, A </p><p>LARGE NUMBER OF PUBLIC APPEARANCES AND SPEECHES </p><p>SINCE THE COMMUNIST PARTY DAILY, GRANMA, ON </p><p>SEPTEMBER 2 DECLARED THE OCHOA/ABRANTES CASES </p><p>CLOSED AND URGED THE NATION TO MOVE FORWARD </p><p>WITH THE LESSONS LEARNED OVER THE SUMMER. </p><p>CASTRO HAS TRAVELED AROUND HAVANA, MATANZAS </p><p>(AT THE VARADERO AIRPORT OPENING), AND THE </p><p>CENTRAL CUBAN PROVINCE OF VILLA CLARA TO SPEAK </p><p>MOSTLY TO CROWDS OF CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL </p><p>WORKERS.  MOST OF THE SPEECHES HAVE BEEN BROADCAST </p><p>OVER PRIME-TIME TV AND CARRIED IN GRANMA. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  AT EACH STOP, CASTRO HAS BEEN PREACHING </p><p>BASICALLY THE SAME LINE:  CUBA HAS EMERGED FROM </p><p>THE SCANDALS STRONGER THAN EVER AND IS MAKING </p><p>IMPORTANT PROGRESS TOWARD RESOLVING THE VARIOUS </p><p>PROBLEMS IT FACES.  SPEAKING AT AN IMPROMPTU </p><p>PRESS CONVERENCE AFTER A PEP TALK TO THE BLAS </p><p>ROCA CONSTRUCTION CONTINGENT ON SEPTEMBER 30, </p><p>CASTRO DECLARED THAT "THE SETBACKS WE HAD </p><p>WERE TURNED INTO VICTORIES."  HE WAS PARTICULARLY </p><p>INTENT ON PORTRAYING THE "TRAUMATIC PROCESS" OF </p><p>CLEANING UP THE INTERIOR MINISTRY (MININT) </p><p>AS MAKING THE ORGANIZATION STRONGER, MORE </p><p>DEDICATED AND MORE EFFICIENT.  MININT IS NOW </p><p>"DOING A GREAT JOB ...AND WILL BE A VERY IMPORTANT </p><p>INSTRUMENT OF THE REVOLUTION." </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  CASTRO ALSO HAS STATED THAT CUBA "HAS FEWER </p><p>PROBLEMS" THAN ANY OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRY EXCEPT </p><p>PERHAPS NORTH KOREA.  HE HAS REPEATEDLY EXPRESSED </p><p>DISDAIN FOR THE REFORMS OF THE "BEGINNER CAPITALISTS" </p><p>AND "BOURGEOUIS DEMOCRATS" IN EASTERN EUROPE </p><p>(I.E., PRO-REFORM SOVIETS, POLES AND HUNGARIANS). </p><p>THE CUBAN MEDIA, TAKING CASTRO\'S CUE, HAVE </p><p>PUBLISHED ARTICLES ALMOST DAILY DEPICTING THE </p><p>CHAOS CAUSED BY THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORMS IN THOSE COUNTRIES.  ON A TYPICAL DAY, </p><p>GRANMA REPORTS ON THE SOVIET UNION\'S NATIONALIST </p><p>AND LABOR STRIFE, POLAND\'S SERIOUS ECONOMIC </p><p>PLIGHT, AND HUNGARY\'S DESTABILIZING SHIFT TOWARD </p><p>A MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  CUBA, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS DOING QUITE </p><p>WELL, ACCORDING TO CASTRO.  WHILE REMAINING </p><p>LOYAL TO SOCIALIST PRECEPTS, IT IS "DOING MORE </p><p>WITH LESS."  HAVANA HAS FEWER RESOURCES THAN </p><p>EVER BEFORE AND ONLY HALF THE FOREIGN RESERVES </p><p>IT USED TO HAVE, CASTRO SAID, BUT THE NATION IS </p><p>"COMPENSATING WITH THE SPIRIT OF WORK."  TO COUNTER </p><p>THE IMPRESSION OF CUBA\'S ISOLATION IN THE SOCIALIST </p><p>WORLD, CASTRO AND THE MEDIA HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S RELATIONS WITH CLOSE AND HELPFUL </p><p>ALLIES.  THE GOC HAS SENT DELEGATIONS TO EAST </p><p>GERMANY, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, BULGARIA, LIBYA AND </p><p>NORTH KOREA IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS TO FIRM UP </p><p>BILATERAL TIES.  CUBA HAS INVESTED PARTICULAR ENERGY </p><p>IN IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH THE PRC, HAILING </p><p>EVERY DEVELOPMENT (INCLUDING CASTRO\'S ATTENDANCE </p><p>AT THE CHINESE NATIONAL DAY RECEPTION IN HAVANA) </p><p>AS A SIGN OF CLOSER TIES. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7.  AT THE SAME TIME, CASTRO IS PROJECTING OPTIMISM </p><p>IN HIS ABILITY TO COUNTER WHAT THE GOC IS </p><p>BILLING AS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN U.S. </p><p>AGGRESSION AGAINST CUBA:  THE LAUNCHING OF TV </p><p>MARTI.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION AT THE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 30 PRESS CONFERENCE, CASTRO SAID CUBA </p><p>HAD A STRONG FIGHTING SPIRIT AND WAS READY TO </p><p>"GIVE A GOOD CHUNK OF IT TO THOSE YANKIS." </p><p>WHILE SAYING THIS, HE FORMED HIS HANDS INTO A </p><p>SHAPE SUGGESTING A GUN AIMED AT AN IMAGINARY TARGET </p><p>IN THE SKY. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8.  CASTRO HAS EVEN BOASTED ABOUT HIS HEALTH. </p><p>HE ADMITTED THAT LAST SUMMER\'S SCANDALS CAUSED </p><p>HIM GREAT BITTERNESS, BUT HE SAID HE DID NOT </p><p>LET IT OVERCOME HIM.  "I ACTED WITH EQUANIMITY," </p><p>HE SAID, ADDING, "I AM VERY WELL.  I WORK A LOT </p><p>BUT THIS IS COMPENSATED BY THE SATISFACTION I </p><p>FEEL WHEN I SEE THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE </p><p>EVERYWHERE." </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>9.  COMMENT:  GROUPS LIKE THE BLAS ROCA CONTINGENT, </p><p>A MODEL WORK UNIT THAT ENJOYS PREFERENTIAL </p><p>ACCESS TO HOUSING AND FOOD, ARE AMONG THE </p><p>MOST LIKELY TO ACCEPT CASTRO\'S OPTIMISTIC </p><p>"MAKE-DO" ASSESSMENT, AS ARE OTHER WORKERS IN PRIORITY </p><p>INDUSTRIES THAT THE COMANDANTE HAS BEEN VISITING. </p><p>OVERALL, HOWEVER, THE JAWBONING WILL LIKELY </p><p>HAVE LITTLE EFFECT.  THE MESSAGE IS THAT </p><p>DOMESTIC POLICIES WILL REMAIN BASICALLY UNCHANGED </p><p>AND THAT THE COUNTRY WILL SIMPLY TIGHTEN ITS </p><p>BELT.  NEITHER THIS NOR THE NEWS THAT MININT </p><p>WILL NOW BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN IN THE </p><p>PAST ARE LIKELY TO INSPIRE JOY.  STILL, CASTRO IS </p><p>TRYING TO MAKE A VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT </p><p>DESPITE SHORTAGES IN CUBA OF FLOUR, GASOLINE, </p><p>MEDICINES, AND MANY OTHER ITEMS, THE PEOPLE </p><p>REMAIN FED AND AT WORK AND THERE IS NO </p><p>INFLATION NOR SOCIAL "DISINTEGRATION" AS IN THE </p><p>"BEGINNING CAPITALIST" STATES. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>10.  CASTRO\'S PUBLIC PUSH ALSO SUGGESTS AN </p><p>EAGERNESS TO REPAIR THE PRESTIGE -- THE </p><p>"MAGIC HOLD" HE HAS ENJOYED OVER HIS PEOPLE -- </p><p>THAT APPARENTLY WAS ERODED BY LAST SUMMER\'S </p><p>SCANDALS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TAYLOR </p><p></p></div>
