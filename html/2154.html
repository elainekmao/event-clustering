<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002841 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, EFIN, PTER, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN EFFORTS TO FREEZE TERRORIST ASSETS </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 185882 (B) ABUJA 2793 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Post provides the following responses to reftel questionnaire: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. President Obasanjo has issued a statement of support for </p><p>the global coalition against terrorism.  On October 8, the </p><p>Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a Circular directing all </p><p>financial institutions in Nigeria to identify accounts </p><p>connected to terrorists identified in Executive Order 13224. </p><p>Another Circular was issued October 17 to include the </p><p>terrorists identified by the Departments of State and </p><p>Treasury on October 12. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. Yes, the CBN issued the order on October 8, 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. No terrorist-related assets have been identified as of </p><p>November 2. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. (i) Nigerian domestic law does not require an UNSCR as a </p><p>prerequisite to freezing financial assets in Nigeria. </p><p>(ii) N/A </p><p>(iii) No action by a multilateral body is required to freeze </p><p>financial assets. </p><p>(iv) Specific anti-terrorism legislation does not currently </p><p>exist in Nigeria.  Draft legislation containing specific </p><p>reference to terrorism, is pending approval by the Executive </p><p>Council (equivalent to the U.S. Cabinet).  An interagency </p><p>committee comprised of officials from the Presidency, Federal </p><p>Ministry of Justice, Central Bank of Nigeria, National Drug </p><p>Law Enforcement Agency and the Federal Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs has been established to revise existing legislation </p><p>and implement UNSCRs 1267, 1333, 1368.  Even without the new </p><p>legislation, CBN Deputy Governor for International Operations </p><p>reported that the NDLEA Decree of 1989 and the Money </p><p>Laundering Decree of 1995 provide sufficient basis for </p><p>freezing terrorist-related assets.  The CBN can also freeze </p><p>accounts based on the order of a court of competent </p><p>jurisdiction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. UNSCRs require domestic legislative and executive action </p><p>to make them effective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F. The NDLEA Decree of 1989 and the Money Laundering Decree </p><p>of 1995 provide sufficient basis for freezing </p><p>terrorist-related assets.  The CBN can also freeze accounts </p><p>based on a court order. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. According to CBN Deputy Governor Ebi, yes, the legal </p><p>authority for a simultaneous freeze exists.  However, the </p><p>decision is ultimately political and would need to come from </p><p>President Obasanjo himself, Ebi states. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. GON has pledged to cooperate fully in preventing </p><p>terrorists access to financial assets in accordance with </p><p>UNSCR 1267.  The CBN has required all banks to identify and </p><p>report on accounts held by terrorist entities pursuant to </p><p>September 23 Executive Order and subsequent designations by </p><p>Secretaries of State and Treasury.  As of November 3, 50 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>banks had reported to the Central Bank. No accounts have been </p><p>identified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. Same as above (H). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>J. GON has not reported any difficulties with implementation </p><p>of UNSCR 1373.  It is noteworthy that the President, Vice </p><p>President, CBN Governor and key Ministers have all offered </p><p>full support in the fight against terrorism.  Draft </p><p>legislation (reported Ref B) criminalizes the financing of </p><p>terrorist organizations, but fails to identify terrorism or </p><p>terrorist groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>K.  Yes, the GON has agreed to freeze assets of the full list </p><p>of 39 persons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>L. (i) According to CBN Deputy Governor Ebi, there are no </p><p>legal restrictions with sharing financial account information </p><p>with foreign authorities.  Ebi has offered Embassy officers </p><p>full disclosure of all CBN files relating to its </p><p>investigation into terrorist accounts. </p><p>(ii) N/A </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>M. Federal Ministry of Justice recently completed draft </p><p>legislation to combat money laundering, financial crimes and </p><p>terrorism.  RNLEO MARK Taylor will carry copies of the draft </p><p>legislation to Washington the week of November 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>N. No GON agency is specifically tasked with implementing UN </p><p>Security Council resolutions.  It is likely that the GON does </p><p>not monitor most UNSCRs.  However, if the decision to </p><p>implement a UNSCR were made, the Federal Ministries of </p><p>Foreign Affairs and Justice would hold primary </p><p>responsibility.  Draft legislation, as described Ref B, </p><p>establishes a Financial Crimes Commission, which might </p><p>subsume responsibility for implementation of UNSCR 1267, </p><p>1333, and 1373. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>O. As described in para M and N above, draft legislation is </p><p>pending approval by the Federal Executive Council (equivalent </p><p>to U.S. Cabinet).  The legislation would then require </p><p>ratification by the National Assembly. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
