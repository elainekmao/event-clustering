<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 000724 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KJUS, SP, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: MENCHU CASE ADVANCES IN SPAIN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: With broad coverage in the Guatemalan press, the </p><p>Spanish Supreme Court reportedly accepted Spanish </p><p>jurisdiction for Nobel Laureate Rigoberta Menchu\'s case </p><p>against six Guatemalan military leaders and two civilian </p><p>officials linked to torture and murder of Spanish citizens in </p><p>Guatemala in the 1980\'s.  The Court reportedly rejected </p><p>jurisdiction for Menchu\'s allegation of genocide, however. </p><p>The Menchu Foundation here called the court decision a step </p><p>in the right direction, but vowed to appeal again.  The </p><p>accused, including President of Congress Efrain Rios Montt, </p><p>reacted calmly to the court decision and seem unconcerned </p><p>about standing trial.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Rigoberta Menchu filed the case upon which the Supreme </p><p>Court decision was based in the Spanish courts in December </p><p>1999.  She accused ex-military and police officials Benedicto </p><p>Lucas Garcia, Romero Lucas Garcia, Efrain Rios Montt, Angel </p><p>Anibal Guevara, Oscar Mejia Victores, German Chupina </p><p>Barahona, Pedro Garcia Arredondo, and Donaldo Alvarez Ruiz, </p><p>with genocide, torture, and terrorism, and the deaths of 200 </p><p>thousand people between 1962 and 1996.  In early 2002, says </p><p>the Menchu foundation, the Spanish National Court ruled it </p><p>would not hear the case, a decision that Menchu appealed.  In </p><p>June 2002, the Spanish Supreme Court accepted the appeal, </p><p>which argued for universal jurisdiction for crimes against </p><p>humanity under Spanish law. </p><p> </p><p>3. Menchu\'s case included the attack by Guatemalan security </p><p>forces on the Spanish Embassy on January 30, 1980, where </p><p>indigenous and guerrilla leaders, and 14 Spanish nationals </p><p>and diplomats, were killed. (Note: Menchu\'s father was among </p><p>those killed.)  The case also includes the murders of four </p><p>Spanish priests between July 1980 and August 1981.  These </p><p>events all occurred during the reign of President Romeo Lucas </p><p>Garcia. </p><p> </p><p>4. The Spanish Supreme Court reportedly ruled in an eight to </p><p>seven decision on March 3, 2003, to return the case to a </p><p>lower court for consideration. However, the Supreme Court </p><p>stipulated that the Spanish domestic courts should only </p><p>concern themselves with the crimes committed against Spanish </p><p>nationals.  The Menchu foundation issued a statement that </p><p>said they were "partially satisfied" the "door to justice was </p><p>left open" but they would appeal the decision to restrict the </p><p>case to Spanish subjects.  Gustavo Meono, Director of the </p><p>Menchu Foundation, said that the Foundation would argue in </p><p>the appeal that "authors of genocide are common enemies of </p><p>all humanity." </p><p> </p><p>ACCUSED TAKE NEWS IN STRIDE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. President of Congress Rios Montt is the only one of the </p><p>accused still serving in a public position.  Upon hearing of </p><p>the court decision, Rios Montt told the press he would </p><p>analyze the case with his lawyers, but that he did not "have </p><p>anything to do with genocide" and that he has disproved </p><p>repeated accusations of misdoing.  Benedicto Lucas Garcia, </p><p>chief of staff of the Army under his brother\'s regime, also </p><p>publicly claimed innocence. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. Press coverage of the Spanish Supreme Court\'s decision </p><p>could negatively affect Rios Montt\'s ongoing campaign for the </p><p>Presidency, but much will depend upon the speed the Menchu </p><p>Foundation\'s appeals move through the Spanish courts. </p><p>Justice for Guatemalan war crimes has moved at a snail\'s </p><p>pace; Menchu and her colleagues are prepared for a long legal </p><p>battle. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
