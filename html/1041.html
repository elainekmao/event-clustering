AN EDITED VERSION OF THIS ENTIRE REPORT IS </p><p>PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS.  NOTE: ALL FIGURES ARE </p><p>PRESENTED IN ZIMBABWE DOLLARS (Z$) WITH A CURRENT U.S. EXCHANGE </p><p>RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 40:1. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>PREAMBLE </p><p> </p><p>3. TROPICAL CYCLONE ELINE ORIGINATED, AS OTHER CYCLONES DO, IN </p><p>THE INDIAN OCEAN, REACHING ZIMBABWE ON FEBRUARY 21, BEFORE </p><p>ENDING OVER BOTSWANA AROUND MARCH 1.  IN ITS WAKE, ELINE LEFT A </p><p>TRAIL OF DEATH AND DEVASTATION THROUGH THE STORMS AND FLOODING, </p><p>THE EXTENT OF WHICH IS UNPRECEDENTED IN LIVING MEMORY. </p><p> </p><p>THE MAJOR AREAS WHICH BORE THE BRUNT OF THE STORMS AND THE </p><p>SUBSEQUENT INUNDATION ARE CHIPINGE AND CHIMANIMANI DISTRICTS IN </p><p>MANICALAND PROVINCE; CHIREDZI AND MWENEZI DISTRICTS IN MASVINGO </p><p>PROVINCE; AND ALL THE SIX DISTRICTS IN MATABELELAND SOUTH </p><p>PROVINCE, NAMELY, BEITBRIDGE, GWANDA, FILABUSI, ESIGODINI, </p><p>PLUMTREE AND KEZI.

ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS FROM THE MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY </p><p>AND COMMERCE, THE EFFECTS OF CYLONE ELINE WILL ADVERSELY </p><p>PERVADE THE ENTIRE ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY.

AN ESTIMATED TOTAL OF 4,400 HECTARES OF PINE TREES </p><p>WERE DESTROYED, REPRESENTING A LOSS TO INVESTMENT OF SOME Z$498 </p><p>MILLION.  WATTLE TREES, WHOSE BARK IS USED IN THE LEATHER </p><p>TANNING INDUSTRY, ALSO EXPERIENCED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE AMOUNTING </p><p>TO SOME Z$138 MILLION. </p><p> </p><p>-SUGAR OUTPUT, AS WELL AS THAT OF COTTON WILL REGISTER A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION AS A RESULT OF WATER-LOGGING. </p><p> </p><p>-THE DISTRIBUTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES WILL BE SERIOUSLY </p><p>AFFECTED SINCE THE MAJOR ROADS AND BRIDGES LEADING OUT OF THE </p><p>EASTERN HIGHLANDS HAVE BEEN DAMAGED. ZIMALLOYS AND ZISCO IN THE </p><p>MIDLANDS (MAJOR ZIMBABWE NATIONAL STEEL/METAL MANUFACTURERS) </p><p>HAVE HAD THEIR OPERATIONS AND EXPORT PROSPECTS SERIOUSLY </p><p>REDUCED, DUE MAINLY TO THE UNSERVICEABLE ROAD AND RAIL LINKS </p><p>WITH BEIRA AND MAPUTO IN MOZAMBIQUE. </p><p> </p><p>-DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRY, SUCH AS FURNITURE MANUFACTURING, WILL FEEL </p><p>THE IMPACT OF THE CYCLONE THROUGH A REDUCTION IN THE SUPPLY OF </p><p>TIMBER.  THIS WILL ALSO AFFECT THEIR EXPORT PERFORMANCE.  THE </p><p>RE-ROUTING OF EXPORTS THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA AND BOTSWANA WILL </p><p>LEAD TO LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS WHICH MIGHT AFFECT THE SCHEDULING OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01901  02 OF 07  070744Z </p><p>EXPORTS. </p><p> </p><p>GENERAL SCOPE OF THE PROBLEMS </p><p> </p><p>5. GENERALLY, THE ENTIRE POPULATION IN THE DISTRICTS UNDER THE </p><p>DECLARATION WAS AFFECTED IN VARYING DEGREES. THE DISRUPTION OF </p><p>THE ROAD NETWORK AND DAMAGE TO AND LOSS OF BRIDGES CUT OFF THE </p><p>POPULATION\'S LIFE-LINE OF SUPPLIES, SUCH AS FOOD, FUEL AND </p><p>SERVICES.  THE FELLING OF TREES BY THE STORMS SEVERED PTC </p><p>(POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION PARASTATAL) AND ZESA </p><p>LINES, RESULTING IN LOSS OF CONTACT WITH THE REST OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY AND POWER FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>-SIMILARLY, THE ENTIRE AFFECTED POPULATION SUFFERED AND, INDEED, </p><p>CONTINUES TO SUFFER FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE DAMAGE TO THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT.  THE MASSIVE LOSS OF TOPSOIL WILL HAVE FAR-REACHING </p><p>IMPLICATIONS ON AGRICULTURE IN THESE DISTRICTS.  THE DAMAGE TO </p><p>THE FLORA AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, THE FAUNA WILL LEAD TO SCARS </p><p>ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL LANDSCAPE WHOSE COST TO THE COUNTRY IS </p><p>INCALCULABLE. </p><p> </p><p>-MORE THAN 200,000 OF THE PEOPLE IN THE AFFECTED AREAS ARE </p><p>CONSIDERED VULNERABLE (THE OLD, THE YOUNG AND THE INFIRM OF BOTH </p><p>GENDERS), OUT OF A TOTAL ESTIMATED POPULATION OF SOME 2.7 </p><p>MILLION PEOPLE.  THE PERSONAL AND COLLECTIVE LOSSES RANGE FROM </p><p>LOSS OF LIFE OF IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS, TO LOSS OF HOUSEHOLDS, </p><p>CROPS AND LIVESTOCK, TO (ANTICIPATED SUBSEQUENT) LOSSES OF BOTH </p><p>LIFE AND LIVESTOCK TO DISEASES AFFLICTING THE SURVIVING </p><p>POPULATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION TO CLINICS, SCHOOLS, DRINKING WATER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01901  02 OF 07  070744Z </p><p>SOURCES, SUCH AS WELLS AND BOREHOLES, AS WELL AS IRRIGATION </p><p>SCHEMES, SERIOUSLY DISRUPTED THE LIVES OF THIS SEGMENT OF THE </p><p>POPULATION. </p><p> </p><p>-ON THE INFRASTRUCTURAL FRONT, MINOR REPAIRS TO ROADS AND </p><p>BRIDGES WERE PERFORMED TO INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY.  THE ARMY </p><p>ERECTED \'BAILEY\' BRIDGES ON MAJOR ROADS, SUCH AS THE CHANGAZI </p><p>AND NYANYADZI BRIDGES, TO IMPROVE ACCESS INTO THE HINTERLAND, </p><p>AND FARM LABOURERS WERE USED TO CLEAR ROADS OF TREES IN </p><p>CHIMANIMANI AND CHIPINGE DISTRICTS.

WHILE THE REHABILITATION IS STILL ONGOING, AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL Z$30 MILLION IN COSTS HAS BEEN INCURRED DUE TO </p><p>REVENUE LOSSES.

AN APPEAL HAS BEEN MADE </p><p>TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS AND UNDP, AND A NUMBER OF ENQUIRIES HAVE BEEN RECEIVED </p><p>FROM FOREIGN MISSIONS, NOTABLY FROM CANADA AND ITALY. </p><p> </p><p>SYNOPSIS OF THE RELIEF, RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION </p><p>STRATEGY </p><p> </p><p>6. FROM THE OUTSET, IT BECAME CLEAR THAT PRIORITIES HAD TO BE </p><p>SET AND STRATEGIES AGREED UPON TO EFFECTIVELY TACKLE THE SUPPLY </p><p>OF RELIEF AND GUIDE THE RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION </p><p>PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>-THE FIRST PRIORITY WAS TO CONDUCT INITIAL DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS </p><p>IN TANDEM WITH THE RESCUE OF MAROONED PEOPLE.  ACCESS BY ROAD </p><p>WAS GROSSLY LIMITED DUE TO DAMAGE TO ROADS AND BRIDGES.  THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE FORCES WERE THEN INVITED TO FLY SORTIES INTO THE </p><p>AREAS.  SIX HELICOPTERS WERE PUT AT (THE DEPARTMENT\'S) DISPOSAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01901  03 OF 07  070744Z </p><p>TOGETHER WITH TWO FIXED-WING PLANES.  THE ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC </p><p>POLICE\'S FIXED-WING SECTION ALSO PROVIDED SIX PLANES WHICH WERE </p><p>USED BOTH FOR RECONNAISSANCE AND AIRLIFTING OF FOODSTUFFS FROM </p><p>HARARE TO AERODROMES IN THE AFFECTED AREAS.  HELICOPTERS </p><p>RESCUED 605 TRAPPED PEOPLE AND ALSO FERRIED FOOD AND OTHER </p><p>RELIEF ITEMS FROM AERODROMES TO INACCESSIBLE AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>-ACCESS TO MOST AREAS IN THE AFFECTED DISTRICTS IS NOW POSSIBLE </p><p>BY LIGHT FOUR WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES, ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION </p><p>REMAINS FLUID WITH THE CONTINUING RAINFALL.  SATELLITE DEPOTS </p><p>HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN AREAS WHERE PEOPLE FROM INACCESSIBLE </p><p>AREAS CAN COME BY SCOTCH-CARTS, DONKEYS OR ON FOOT TO RECEIVE </p><p>RELIEF.  ALTERNATIVELY, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUT IN CAMPS TO ENSURE </p><p>EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF RELIEF SUPPLIES AND SUSTENANCE. </p><p> </p><p>-MEANWHILE, DONATIONS IN CASH AND KIND HAVE CONTINUED TO POUR </p><p>INTO THE COFFERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL PROTECTION AND THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE RED CROSS SOCIETY.  TO DATE, THE DEPARTMENT HAS </p><p>RECEIVED SOME Z$10,850,000 IN CASH, IN ADDITION TO DONATIONS OF </p><p>20 TONS OF MAIZE, 3 TONS OF MEALIE (MAIZE) MEAL, 5.8 TONS OF </p><p>MILK, BEANS, SUGAR, KAPENTA (FISH) AND OTHER FOOD ITEMS.  OTHER </p><p>ITEMS SUCH AS APPROX. 6,000 BLANKETS, 240 PLASTIC ROLLS, 110 </p><p>TENTS, SOAP AND USED CLOTHING WERE ALSO DONATED.  THE ZIMBABWE </p><p>RED CROSS SOCIETY HAS RECEIVED Z$11.3 MILLION IN CASH, AS WELL </p><p>AS VARIOUS DONATED COMMODITIES, SUCH AS 5 TONS OF SUGAR, 60 TONS </p><p>MEALIE-MEAL, KAPENTA, KITCHEN UTENSILS, PLASTIC SHEETING AND </p><p>BLANKETS.  OTHER ITEMS WERE DONATED DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED </p><p>AREAS BY NGOS AND CIVIC GROUPS.  HOWEVER, AS A CONTROL MEASURE, </p><p>MEASURES HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE WHICH ENABLE THE DISTRICT </p><p>ADMINISTRATORS AND PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATORS TO COMPILE </p><p>AGGREGATE CHARTS OF ALL DONATIONS DISTRIBUTED WITHIN THEIR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01901  03 OF 07  070744Z </p><p>RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS TO DATE. </p><p> </p><p>-THE APPEAL FOR RELIEF ITEMS CONTINUES, SINCE THE BULK OF THE </p><p>VULNERABLE POPULATION HAVE NO MEANS TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES WELL </p><p>INTO NEXT YEAR.  THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL WELFARE, WHICH HAS </p><p>SOME Z$12 MILLION IN THEIR (BUDGET) ALLOCATION, HAS BEEN </p><p>REQUESTED TO ASSESS THE FOOD REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE IN NEED FOR </p><p>THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>-IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM, THE STRATEGY ENVISAGES THE </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION OF HOMESTEADS, GRANARIES AND BLAIR TOILETS </p><p>DAMAGED OR DESTROYED BY THE FLOODS.
