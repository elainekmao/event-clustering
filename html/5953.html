O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Modest Hike in Fuel Prices </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 338 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary:  The GOZ has nearly doubled the price of </p><p>fuel, the first increase since June 2001.  The higher </p><p>pump price still reflects a heavy and unsustainable </p><p>subsidy, meaning the country\'s fuel shortage will </p><p>continue. Nonetheless, this is a small step toward market- </p><p>determined pricing.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Blend fuel now costs US$.46/gallon and diesel </p><p>.37/gallon, increases of 95 and 80 percent.  (Zimbabwean </p><p>motorists rarely use unleaded.)  The official press </p><p>reports that the GOZ is controlling diesel at a lower </p><p>rate to soften the blow on public transit users, who </p><p>mostly rely on diesel-operated vans. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) We briefly discussed the price increase with reps </p><p>from BP/Shell and Caltex this morning.  Each considers it </p><p>a welcome step, but too little to affect Zimbabwe\'s acute </p><p>fuel shortage.  Both downstream operators are partly </p><p>offsetting losses on infrequent retail and commercial </p><p>supplies from the national oil agency NOCZIM by signing </p><p>up new customers for direct-import service.  Companies </p><p>and organizations (like the U.S. Embassy) may engage oil </p><p>firms to import fuel for their operations and staff if </p><p>they pay in U.S. dollars.  The Caltex rep said virtually </p><p>every serious business in Zimbabwe is now either already </p><p>direct-importing, or exploring the possibility.  However, </p><p>a 3-4 fold increase in fuel cost is obviously a burden </p><p>for companies whose goods and services are price- </p><p>controlled. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Everyone in the oil business knows where </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s fuel market is heading.  Motorists will one </p><p>day buy unsubsidized fuel, imported by fuel companies and </p><p>overseen by a NOCZIM that will have evolved into a </p><p>regulatory agency.  However, the GOZ has a vested </p><p>interest in postponing that day of reckoning and </p><p>maintaining the economic distortion.  Confused by large </p><p>Zimdollar salaries and low controlled prices, most </p><p>Zimbabweans do not appreciate how little their US$ 5- </p><p>40/month salaries buy in the world market (ref).  As </p><p>distortions are stripped away, Zimbabweans will have to </p><p>come to terms with their acute impoverishment -- and how </p><p>they got there. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
