<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 001802 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/CT, EUR/SE, NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: INITIAL GOT RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON CLOSURE OF </p><p>IRAQI MISSION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 72921 B)ANKARA 1794 C) ANKARA 1743 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(u) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) During his March 20 meeting with MFA U/S Ziyal (ref </p><p>c), Ambassador followed up his recent requests for the GOT to </p><p>expel Iraqi intelligence officers (ref b) by urging the GOT </p><p>to suspend Iraq\'s diplomatic presence in Turkey on a </p><p>temporary basis and take steps to assure the prompt departure </p><p>of the leading representatives of Saddam Hussein\'s government </p><p>(ref a).  The Ambassador said that the USG specifically </p><p>requests that the GOT declare the Iraqi ambassador and other </p><p>suspected Iraqi intelligence officers still in Turkey persona </p><p>non grata, and ensure that they promptly leave Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF) Ziyal said the matter would require a political </p><p>decision and agreed to refer it to the proper authorities. </p><p>Ziyal went on to say that hypothetically speaking, if the GOT </p><p>were to agree to shut down the Iraqi mission and expel Iraqi </p><p>embassy staff, where would Turkey send them?  Ziyal said the </p><p>Iraqis could not be expected to return to Iraq. The </p><p>Ambassador responded that the real issue was for the GOT to </p><p>take the necessary steps now to disrupt the activities of the </p><p>Iraqi intelligence services who are threatening US personnel </p><p>and facilities in Turkey.  The best way to disrupt these </p><p>activities is to expel the high-level members of the Iraqi </p><p>diplomatic mission and the intelligence officers, and to shut </p><p>down temporarily the mission. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) Ziyal asked the Ambassador if the USG was making </p><p>the same request to other countries.  The Ambassador replied </p><p>yes.  Ziyal asked if we knew which countries could be </p><p>expected to receive the expelled Iraqis.  The Ambassador said </p><p>he did not know, but would refer the question to Washington. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
