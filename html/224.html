<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BAGHDAD 04559 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI COMMENTARY WARNS AGAINST TILT TOWARD IRAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS JN1808064588 (#) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: WE ARE SOMEWHAT PUZZLED BY IRAQ NEWS </p><p>AGENCY COMMENTARY, ALMOST CERTAINLY COMING DIRECTLY </p><p>FROM THE PRESIDENCY, ACCUSING "IMPERIALIST POWERS" </p><p>(I.E., UNITED STATES MOST OF ALL) OF PRESSING IRAN </p><p>TO ACCEPT UNSCR 598 IN ORDER TO PREVENT KHOMEINI\'S </p><p>COLLAPSE.  WE INTERPRET THIS BLUSTER AS SADDAM\'S </p><p>BULLYING WAY OF SAYING WHAT IS PATENTLY TRUE, THAT </p><p>THE UPCOMING PERIOD WILL BE A TEST OF IRAQ\'S RELA- </p><p>TION WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER EXTERNAL POWERS. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. BAGHDAD TELEVISION, RADIO, AND ALL NEWSPAPERS </p><p>AUGUST 18 PROMINENTLY CARRIED A VEHEMENT BUT MORE </p><p>THAN USUALLY INARTICULATE EDITORIAL (REF FBIS), </p><p>ATTRIBUTED TO THE POLITICAL EDITOR OF THE IRAQ NEWS </p><p>AGENCY, SHARPLY WARNING WORLD POWERS AGAINST GIVING </p><p>SUPPORT TO IRAN DURING THE CEASE-FIRE PERIOD.  FROM </p><p>ITS PROMINENCE, IT UNDOUBTEDLY EMANATED FROM THE </p><p>PRESIDENCY ITSELF.  THE COMMENTARY WARNED THAT "SOME </p><p>IMPERIALIST POWERS" (UNSPECIFIED BUT CLEARLY INCLUDING </p><p>THE UNITED STATES) WANT TO KEEP ARAB COUNTRIES </p><p>OCCUPIED IN DISPUTES WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS (I.E., </p><p>IRAN) IN ORDER TO PROTECT ISRAEL.  IT CLAIMED CERTAIN </p><p>POWERS HAD PRESSED IRAN TO ACCEPT RESOLUTION 598 </p><p>IN ORDER TO PREVENT KHOMEINI\'S COLLAPSE. </p><p> </p><p>3. COMMENT: WHILE WE KNOW THE IRAQIS FEAR THAT THE </p><p>U.S. WILL RESUME A PRO-IRANIAN POLICY TO THE DETRIMENT </p><p>OF IRAQI INTERESTS, THE PROMINENCE AND TIMING OF THE </p><p>EDITORIAL ARE CURIOUS.  WE HAVE REASSURAD THE IRAWI </p><p>AZ A HIGH GEVEL AND THROUGH DIFFERENT CHANNELS THAT </p><p>WE DO NOT CONTEMPLATE "TILTING" IN EITHER DIRECTION. </p><p> </p><p>4. WE CONCLUDE THAT THIS FORM OF INARTICULATE LASHING </p><p>OUT SERVES MORE THAN ANYTHING TO DEMONSTRATE IRAQ\'S </p><p>SENSE OF INSECURITY.  A NEW ERA IS EMERGING, AND IRAQ </p><p>IS NERVOUS ABOUT THE DEVELOPING ATTITUDES OF EXTERNAL </p><p>POWERS.  SADDAM\'S INSTINCTIVE REACTION IS TO WARN </p><p>WITH BLUSTERING, UNSPECIFIC THREATS.  TARIQ AZIZ </p><p>AND THE MFA DIPLOMATSSTRESS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE </p><p>SAME COIN, I.E., THEIR HOPE AND DESIRE THAT THE </p><p>POST-WAR PERIOD WILL WITNESS BROADER AND CLOSER </p><p>COOPERATION WITH THE USG THROUGHOUT THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p> </p><p>NOTE BY OC/T: (#) OMISSION IN REF.  CORRECTION TO FOLLOW. </p><p></p></div>
