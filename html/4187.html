FRANKFURT 3580 (NOTAL); B. FRANKFURT 5829; C. </p><p>FRANKFURT 6207 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: This report summarizes the events at the </p><p>Frankfurt terrorism trial from July to September 2002.  Four </p><p>Algerian and one Moroccan (listed below) are accused of </p><p>planning an attack on the Strasbourg Christmas market in </p><p>December 2000 and bomb building materials were found in </p><p>their Frankfurt apartments.  They were arrested in December </p><p>2000 and their trial began in Frankfurt, April 2002.  The </p><p>defendants have claimed that their intention was to bomb an </p><p>empty Jewish synagogue and not to kill anyone.  The court is </p><p>trying to determine a) what the intended target actually </p><p>was; b) if there was any connection to other terrorists or </p><p>terrorist organizations.  Two London contacts, presumed to </p><p>be Islamic extremists, have been mentioned: Abu Doha and </p><p>Noureddine.  Thus far, no firm Al Qaeda link has been found, </p><p>although a witness, Sadikki, mentioned that defendant </p><p>Beandali had contact with Abdul Rachman, described as "a </p><p>representative of Usama Bin Laden in London."  This report </p><p>will focus on the testimonies of the defendants, Beandali, </p><p>Boukari, Karimou, Maroni and Sabour and that of a witness, </p><p>Sadikki.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Defendants and Witnesses </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) We are repeating here the names, dates of birth and </p><p>known aliases of the defendants.  (Some variances in </p><p>spelling have been seen in different sources.) </p><p> </p><p>Defendants: </p><p>-    Aeurobui Beandali (also Deandali) DOB 12/10/1975; aka </p><p>  Ben Ali; aka Mustapha Mestpha Kelouili DOB 11/19/1978; aka </p><p>  Djilali Benali Correia DOB 7/15/1975; aka Djilali Adadi DOB </p><p>  6/5/1975.  (Presumed Algerian.) </p><p> </p><p>-    Samir Karimou (also Krimou) aka Ibrahim Ahmed, DOB </p><p>  12/18/1968. (Released from prison August 30, 2002. </p><p>  Continues to attend trial.) Moroccan. </p><p> </p><p>-    Lamine Moroni, DOB 1/10/1970; aka Benard Pascale, DOB </p><p>  7/25/1970. (Presumed Algerian.) </p><p> </p><p>-    Fouhad Sabour, DOB 2/13/1965; aka Hassene Benaimine DOB </p><p>  12/08/1967; aka Samir Bouinoual DOB 8/9/1978; aka Alain </p><p>  Dubois. (Born in France.) </p><p> </p><p>-    Salim Boukhari (also Boukari), DOB 8/8/1971; aka Hicham </p><p>  El-Haddad, DOB 4/30 1980; aka Claude Aman, DOB 8/8/1971; aka </p><p>  Karim Muscat DOB 8/8/1971; aka Messaoud (also Mesud) Zamali </p><p>  (also Zemani) DOB 8/4/1966.  (Presumed Algerian.) </p><p> </p><p>Witnesses: </p><p>-    Aknoush, in detention in France.  Beandali\'s attorney, </p><p>  Diebrucks and Aknoush\'s attorney have been in touch. </p><p>  Aknoush\'s written statements have been considered by the </p><p>  Frankfurt court although Aknoush has not yet appeared for </p><p>  questioning.  He is expected to testify in Frankfurt in the </p><p>  coming weeks. </p><p> </p><p>- Mohammed Sadikki, was in prison along with Marino and </p><p>  Beandali in two German prisons.  Beandali asked Sadikki </p><p>  to deliver messages to a mosque in Frankfurt. </p><p> </p><p>Aeurobui Beandali: The Bomb Builder </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Aeurobui Beandali was the first of the defendants </p><p>to testify before the court.  Beandali admitted he was an </p><p>expert in explosives and said it was his job to buy the bomb- </p><p>building materials.  He said he was specially trained in </p><p>Afghanistan in religion, light weapons, heavy weapons and </p><p>explosives (dates of his training are disputed but he </p><p>claimed about November 1999 - August 2000).  He explained </p><p>that the bomb was to be placed in a large Pakistan-made </p><p>steam pot, which he ordered in London.  He also bought large </p><p>amounts of potassium permanganate, which he said he </p><p>originally wanted to use for an attack in Algeria.  Beandali </p><p>claimed surprise that the target might be in France and said </p><p>he did not want to kill Europeans. </p><p> </p><p>Target: Christmas Market or Synagogue? </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Beandali claimed that Salim Boukhari, another </p><p>defendant and member of the group, was receiving orders from </p><p>London to attack a target in France.  According to Beandali, </p><p>Boukhari reassured Beandali that the target would be an </p><p>empty synagogue in Strasbourg.  Beandali ordered Boukhari </p><p>and Sabour to drive to Strasbourg and film the synagogue </p><p>both inside and outside so he could build the right size </p><p>bomb for the target.  When the completed videotape showed </p><p>the Christmas Market area instead of the synagogue, Beandali </p><p>said he became very angry and ordered Boukhari and Sabour to </p><p>try again a second time in Strasbourg, this time with a city </p><p>map.  They were arrested before they could make a second </p><p>trip.  (Note: The videotape was shown in court on August 27, </p><p>2002 and clearly showed the Strasbourg Christmas market and </p><p>surrounding area, panning the market and stalls several </p><p>times.  Audio comments were heard on the tape referring to </p><p>"the enemies of God." There was no synagogue on the </p><p>videotape. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Who is Noureddine and What Was His Role? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Beandali said he had started to wonder if </p><p>Boukari\'s plan to attack an empty synagogue was actually </p><p>true when the videotape showed the Christmas market area </p><p>near the cathedral.  Beandali said that when he learned that </p><p>a man named Noureddine in London was behind the plan, he </p><p>found it even more unlikely that the target was only an </p><p>empty building.  "A guy like Noureddine certainly had </p><p>something more spectacular in mind, something where people </p><p>could be hurt."  Beandali said he met Noureddine in </p><p>Afghanistan and noted he did not follow Islamic washing </p><p>rites.  He described Noureddine as an Algerian with a French </p><p>passport living in London.  He also claimed that Noureddine </p><p>was an undercover agent of French intelligence and that </p><p>Noureddine had told Beandali that the French secret service </p><p>had offered him money to inform on Algerians living in </p><p>London and Afghanistan.  Beandali also said that Noureddine </p><p>was flown out of the Balkans by the French government. </p><p>Noureddine was also interested in a man named Hischam, </p><p>Beandali claimed was wanted by the FBI.  Beandali said he </p><p>helped Hischam escape from Afghanistan to London, then to </p><p>Germany and Spain.  Eventually, Hischam was arrested in </p><p>Algeria and Beandali believes Noureddine turned Hischam into </p><p>authorities. </p><p> </p><p>Comment on Beandali\'s Statements </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Comment:  Beandali and Boukhari are in a mutual </p><p>blame game to show that the other is a) the leader of the </p><p>group; or b) in touch with a London contact giving the </p><p>orders for the group.  Beandali accuses Boukhari of being </p><p>the leader and knowing the "real" plan (i.e. to bomb the </p><p>Christmas market and kill people).  Beandali claims that </p><p>Boukhari hid this plan from Beandali.  So who is the leader, </p><p>Beandali, Boukhari, or someone in London?  Maroni, in one of </p><p>his rare statements, describes Beandali as the one giving </p><p>the orders for the group.  Regarding the target, Beandali is </p><p>the only one of the five defendants who openly questioned </p><p>the claim of the others that the plan was to attack an empty </p><p>synagogue.  The videotape showing only the Christmas market </p><p>in Strasbourg is compelling evidence.  By claiming he played </p><p>no part in selecting the "real target," Beandali seeks to </p><p>protect himself against charges of attempted murder. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Salim Boukhari </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The defendant Salim Boukhari appears to have been </p><p>somewhat of a geographic outsider to the Frankfurt cell, </p><p>with stronger connections to London.  He lived in London </p><p>starting about 1995 and married there twice.  After his </p><p>divorce in 1998, he stayed one or two months with Noureddine </p><p>in London.  Boukhari said he originally wanted to donate </p><p>money to the Algerian freedom struggle but instead used it </p><p>to go to Afghanistan (September 1999 - early 2000, but dates </p><p>unclear) where he trained in light and heavy weapons, </p><p>electronics and religion.  He moved to Germany in mid- </p><p>November 2000. </p><p> </p><p>Boukhari Tries to Implicate Beandali in Knowledge of Target </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Boukhari refused to answer questions from the </p><p>prosecution and only responded to those from the judges. </p><p>Boukhari\'s statements were often confusing and inconsistent. </p><p>Boukhari said that he intended to return to London in </p><p>December 2000 and it was uncertain whether he would be </p><p>present at the time of the attack.  Boukhari admits he was </p><p>the point of contact for Nourredine in London.  Boukhari </p><p>claims, however, that Nourreddine did not give orders or </p><p>designate a target but gave "only ideas."  Boukhari\'s </p><p>statements showed frequent inconsistencies in describing </p><p>Beandali\'s role and advance knowledge of the target.  First </p><p>Boukhari insisted Beandali knew about the bombing plans as </p><p>early as November, 2000.  Beandali vigorously denied this. </p><p>Then Boukhari changed this to say, "Beandali knew about a </p><p>phone call with Nourredine (in November)."  Again, Beandali </p><p>denied it, and seemed to want to distance himself from </p><p>Noureddine, whom he apparently distrusted as an informant </p><p>(see para 5). </p><p> </p><p>Was Boukhari the Leader?  He Admits Contact with London </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Boukhari contradicted Beandali on a question </p><p>about the use of the Baden Baden apartment.  Beandali said </p><p>the apartment was intended as a kind of "storage place" for </p><p>the materials for the bomb that was to be built in </p><p>Frankfurt.  Boukhari said he had intented actually to build </p><p>the bomb in Baden Baden.  Aknoush, a witness in detention in </p><p>Paris, stated that Boukhari was in contact with Abu Doha in </p><p>London.  Boukhari said he had spoken with Abu Doha but only </p><p>on the subject of renting rooms in Baden Baden.  Aknoush </p><p>also said that Boukhari was the assigned leader of the </p><p>Frankfurt cell. </p><p> </p><p>Sabour and Maroni: Maroni says Beandali was the Leader, </p><p>Sabour says Beandali was in Touch with London </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Fouhad Sabour\'s statement came haltingly and was </p><p>sometimes inconsistent with previous statements by the other </p><p>defendants.  Sabour\'s role in the plot is unclear. </p><p>Boukhari, in his statements, denied that Sabour had any </p><p>detailed knowledge of the advance planning of the bombing. </p><p>It seems Sabour was assigned some duties to help in carrying </p><p>out the attack together with Boukhari or Beandali.  Sabour </p><p>admitted having accompanied Boukhari on their trip to </p><p>Strasbourg to videotape the target.  Sabour also stated that </p><p>Beandali was assigned to participate in the attack together </p><p>with him.  In response to the question of who planned the </p><p>attack, Sabour delivered yet another version: the plan to </p><p>attack the synagogue in Strasbourg was entirely the decision </p><p>of the Frankfurt group.  But Sabour also mentioned that </p><p>Beandali was in frequent phone contact with London. </p><p>"Beandali phoned London," was among Sabour\'s favorite </p><p>phrases.  (Comment: Sabour seemed to regard Beandali as head </p><p>of the cell, though he did not specifically say so.  End </p><p>Comment.)  Maroni confirmed Sabour\'s statements and also </p><p>indicated he viewed Beandali as the group\'s leader.  Lamine </p><p>Maroni has not yet formally testified, though he announced </p><p>he would do so in the near future. </p><p> </p><p>Busid Karimou Released, Continues to Attend Trial </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Busid Karimou was released from detention on </p><p>August 30, 2002.  The court could not find any evidence he </p><p>was involved in the preparations for the bomb attack, thus </p><p>he was only charged with membership in a terrorist </p><p>organization.  This carries a one-to-ten year sentence. </p><p>Since Karimou has already served 17 months in detention and </p><p>the court apparently felt he would not get more than a two- </p><p>year sentence, he was released.  (Note: It is common </p><p>practice in the German legal system to release a well- </p><p>behaved prisoner after two-thirds of his sentence is over. </p><p>Further justification is required to keep Karimou for his </p><p>full length of sentence.  End Note.)  Born in Morocco, </p><p>Karimou went to Germany in February 1999, but later moved to </p><p>London.  From there he went to Afghanistan for training, a </p><p>fact that he denied in his previous statements.  He returned </p><p>to London after only three months of training and from there </p><p>moved to Frankfurt in July 2000.  Apparently his apartment </p><p>there was used as a meeting point for the group.  Karimou </p><p>refused to acknowledge any prior knowledge of the attack. </p><p> </p><p>Witness Mohammed Sadikki Claims Beandali had Al Qaeda </p><p>Contact in London: Abdul Rachman </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Mohammed Sadikki, who was not very impressive in </p><p>recalling details, was an inmate along with Maroni and </p><p>Beandali in two German prisons.  His statement revealed  the </p><p>rather lax conditions regarding contact between prisoners. </p><p>In both Kassel and Weiterstadt prison he easily established </p><p>contact with Maroni and Beandali, who both tried to win him </p><p>over for their group.  They also asked Sadikki to deliver </p><p>messages to contacts after his release.  Maroni told Sadikki </p><p>that Maroni knew secrets he had not told police.  Maroni </p><p>also admitted having participated in a number of terrorist </p><p>operations in the U.K.  According to Sadikki, Beandali asked </p><p>Sadikki to deliver a message to a mosque in Frankfurt and </p><p>talked of the need to fight Christians and Jews.  Beandali </p><p>mentioned a synagogue in Lille, France as a potential </p><p>target.  Beandali also said that his group planned further </p><p>attacks in Germany, France and Spain.  Beandali never </p><p>mentioned the Strasbourg Christmas market to Sadikki, but </p><p>Beandali said he would like to turn Rome, the cradle of </p><p>Christianity, into ashes. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Sadikki verified Beandali\'s role as bomb expert </p><p>and indicated that Beandali and other members of the group </p><p>coordinated their testimonies in prison before the trial </p><p>started.  Sadikki mentioned Usama Bin Laden twice.  Beandali </p><p>asked Sadikki to contact a man named Abdul Rachman in London </p><p>after his release.  Beandali described Rachman as "Usama bin </p><p>Laden\'s representative" in London, who had also promised to </p><p>take hostages to force the release of the members of the </p><p>Frankfurt cell from prison.  Beandali told Sadikki that the </p><p>camp in Afghanistan at which he was trained was run by Usama </p><p>bin Laden.  Sadikki said the Frankfurt group had 38 million </p><p>Deutsche marks at their disposal (which caused the other </p><p>defendants to laugh).  Sadikki also said that the group used </p><p>forged and stolen credit cards. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: Beandali Against the Rest </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  Several rounds of testimony have not resolved </p><p>key questions of the prosecution: What was the structure of </p><p>the group?  Who was the leader?  Was there an external (i.e. </p><p>London-based) leader, who gave instructions?  Whose idea was </p><p>the bombing plan and what exactly was its goal?  Did the </p><p>group intend to kill people at the Christmas market or did </p><p>they "only" want to bomb an empty synagogue?  This question </p><p>is crucial for deciding their sentence.  What has indeed </p><p>changed over the previous weeks is the strategy of the </p><p>defendants and the defense.  After first appearing to be a </p><p>concerted effort by the defendants, the trial now looks more </p><p>like a game of "Beandali against the rest."  Boukari, Maroni </p><p>and Sabour (who apparently dislikes Beandali) state that </p><p>Beandali was the group\'s leader.  It is relatively clear </p><p>that Beandali and Boukari are the key responsible figures, </p><p>though their exact roles are still shadowy. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Comment Continued: Another trend we noted in </p><p>recent trial sessions is that Beandali\'s lawyer, Diebrucks, </p><p>has developed into a leading voice for the defense.  He has </p><p>played a very proactive role.  This was shown, for instance </p><p>in the meeting between Diebrucks and the lawyer for Aknoush, </p><p>another key witness now in detention in France.  (Note:  To </p><p>add to the confusion, some journalists observing the trial </p><p>believe Aknoush may have been the leader of the Frankfurt </p><p>group.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Comment Cont: Beandali\'s Statements May Help Prosecution </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU) Comment Continued: Despite the confusing </p><p>allegations by others, Beandali\'s statements were the most </p><p>consistent.  Beandali claimed that Boukari planned the </p><p>attack and that he himself was "just the bomb builder." </p><p>Beandali\'s is the only one who, in his statements, has cast </p><p>doubt on the synagogue as the actual target.  His strategy </p><p>may be to save his skin by discrediting the other </p><p>defendants, which would also explain the opposition he faces </p><p>from the other accused.  Beandali\'s early cooperation with </p><p>the court could also work to his advantage.  In addition to </p><p>the strong evidence of the videotape, the prosecution has </p><p>found in Beandali\'s statements support for their case that </p><p>the target was the Christmas market -- and human victims. </p><p>After a rough start, the prosecution seems to be gaining </p><p>ground, though they still have a long way to go to make </p><p>their case.  The story of an attack on a synagogue has been </p><p>used consistently by all other defendants and witnesses </p><p>testifying thus far.  Aknoush\'s future testimony, and </p><p>eventually Maroni\'s, may result in better evidence for the </p><p>prosecution.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U) This message has been coordinated with Embassy </p><p>Berlin. </p><p> </p><p>BODDE </p><p></p></div>
