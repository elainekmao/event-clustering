(U) SUMMARY: AN OFDA-FUNDED DISASTER RELIEF PROJECT </p><p>HAS BROUGHT A SMALL MEASURE OF RELIEF TO POVERTY- </p><p>STRICKEN MEKONG DELTA FAMILIES, HARD HIT BY DROUGHT AND </p><p>FOREST FIRES IN KIEN GIANG PROVINCE, VIETNAM.  THESE </p><p>COMMUNITIES EKE OUT A MARGINAL EXISTENCE AROUND THE U </p><p>MINH THUONG NATIONAL PARK, WHICH IS ITSELF THREATENED </p><p>BY POACHING AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE POLICY DECISIONS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>USAID DISASTER ASSISTANCE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ON JULY 17, AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT AND AN </p><p>EMBASSY/CONSULATE GENERAL TEAM (DPO, ECONOFF, FSN </p><p>POL/ECON ASSISTANT, OFDA OFFICER/MANILA, AND A PRIVATE </p><p>WATER MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT) OBSERVED THE STARK </p><p>AFTERMATH OF DROUGHT AND FIRE IN THE U MINH THUONG </p><p>NATIONAL PARK IN KIEN GIANG PROVINCE.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>HAD DECLARED THIS AREA ELIGIBLE FOR DISASTER RELIEF </p><p>AFTER FIRES LAST MARCH BURNED DOWN MORE THAN 2300 </p><p>HECTARES, REDUCING THE COMPLEX FOREST ECOSYSTEM TO </p><p>BURNT PEAT AND CHARRED LOGS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) AT THE AMBASSADOR\'S REQUEST, USAID/OFDA PROVIDED </p><p>USD 50,000 FOR DISASTER RELIEF.  THE OFDA FUNDS </p><p>PROVIDED FRESH DRINKING WATER, ESTABLISHED INCOME- </p><p>GENERATING PROJECTS IN AQUACULTURE, BEE KEEPING, AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00779  01 OF 02  300824Z </p><p>BROOM-MAKING, AND DEVELOPED A WATER </p><p>SANITATION/ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.  IN </p><p>ADDITION TO THE OFDA DISASTER RELIEF PROJECT, CARE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ALSO MANAGES A FIVE-YEAR PROGRAM NEAR THE </p><p>U MINH THUONG PARK TO PROVIDE MICRO-LOANS AND CREDIT, </p><p>IMPROVE VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE, CONDUCT AGRICULTURAL </p><p>RESEARCH, AND REFOREST PARK AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>THE U MINH THUONG NATIONAL PARK </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) THE U MINH THUONG NATIONAL PARK (UMT) COVERS </p><p>8000 HECTARES OF MARSHLANDS AND "MELALEUCA" FOREST TO </p><p>THE CAMBODIAN BORDER.  "MELALEUCA" IS AN INDIGENOUS </p><p>TREE IN KIEN GIANG AND GROWS IN THE HIGHLY ACIDIC PEAT </p><p>SOIL HERE.  IN 1993, THE GVN DESIGNATED UMT AS A NATURE </p><p>RESERVE TO PRESERVE ITS THREATENED PLANT AND ANIMAL </p><p>SPECIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE TO THIS </p><p>AREA.  IN ADDITION TO HOSTING RARE TREES AND FERNS, UMT </p><p>IS THE ONLY REMAINING PEAT SWAMP FOREST ECOSYSTEM IN </p><p>VIETNAM.  THE AREA IS ALSO ONE OF THE LAST TWO </p><p>REMAINING HABITATS IN THE WORLD FOR THE ENDANGERED </p><p>HAIRY-NOSED OTTER, AND CONTAINS THE LARGEST WATER BIRD </p><p>COLONY IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>QUESTIONABLE LOGIC: RESETTLING A LANDLESS POPULATION </p><p>AROUND A NATURE RESERVE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) SHORTLY AFTER THE UMT RESERVE WAS CREATED IN </p><p>1993, THE GVN MOVED 3160 PREVIOUSLY LANDLESS HOUSEHOLDS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00779  01 OF 02  300824Z </p><p>(APPROXIMATELY 17,000 PEOPLE) INTO A 13,000-HECTARE </p><p>BUFFER ZONE.  THE GVN GAVE EACH FAMILY FOUR HECTARES OF </p><p>LAND FOR RICE PRODUCTION AND SMALL-SCALE AQUACULTURE. </p><p>IN RETURN FOR THE LAND, EACH HOUSEHOLD MUST REPAY THE </p><p>GVN USD 2,000 IN SEVEN YEARS (ALTHOUGH THE PAYMENT </p><p>SCHEDULE IS FLEXIBLE), AND GROW ONE HECTARE OF </p><p>"MELALEUCA" TREES, THUS REDUCING THEIR AVAILABLE LAND </p><p>TO THREE HECTARES.  IN ADDITION, THE FAMILIES MUST ALSO </p><p>PROTECT THE CORE ZONE FROM BEING ILLEGALLY HARVESTED. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) THE ALLOCATION OF FOUR HECTARES OF FERTILE </p><p>FARMLAND TO PREVIOUSLY LANDLESS FARMERS GENERATED HIGH </p><p>EXPECTATIONS, BUT IT APPEARS MOST DREAMS HAVE YET TO BE </p><p>FULFILLED.  THE WOODEN OR BAMBOO HOUSES, MANY WITH </p><p>THATCHED ROOFS AND WALLS OF PLASTIC SACKING, CONTAIN </p><p>THE BAREST ESSENTIALS AND WERE LITTLE MORE THAN SEMI- </p><p>ENCLOSED RAIN SHELTERS.  KITCHEN, BATHING AND RESTROOM </p><p>FACILITIES CONSIST OF PLATFORMS OVER THE CANALS THAT </p><p>CRISSCROSS THE BUFFER ZONE.  RESIDENTS LOOKED GAUNT AND </p><p>TIRED.  A FORMER TECHNICAL ADVISOR TO UMT PARK SAID </p><p>THAT BUFFER ZONE RESIDENTS OFTEN FAIL AT FARMING AND </p><p>LEASE THEIR PROPERTY TO OTHERS, BECOMING SQUATTERS ON </p><p>THEIR OWN LAND. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ0392 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HO CHI  00779  02 OF 02  300824Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  ITCE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EXME-00  E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  FDRE-01  VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  NSF-01   OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   SP-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------D1E5B9  300827Z /38 </p><p>P 300707Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6589 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY HANOI PRIORITY </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>USDA WASHDC </p><p>AMEMBASSY BANGKOK </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000779 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/PD </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR OES/ETC AND USAID </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/FAA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00779  02 OF 02  300824Z </p><p>OF THE MISERY IN VIETNAM\'S MEKONG DELTA </p><p> </p><p>BUT THERE ARE PLANS FOR A WAR MEMORIAL IN UMT PARK </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) THE GVN RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO DEVELOP A </p><p>SECTION OF THE CORE ZONE AS A WAR MEMORIAL AND TOURISM </p><p>SITE.  CARE INTERNATIONAL STAFF FEAR THAT THE ROAD </p><p>CONSTRUCTION WILL DAMAGE U MINH THUONG\'S ECOSYSTEM AND </p><p>FACILITATE POACHING.  THEY HAVE URGED THE KIEN GIANG </p><p>PROVINCE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE TO COMPLETE AN </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FOR THE ROAD, AS REQUIRED </p><p>UNDER VIETNAM\'S ENVIRONMENTAL LAW.  TO DATE, THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE HAS NOT ISSUED AN ASSESSMENT, WHICH </p><p>SOME CARE STAFF MEMBERS S ATTRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL- </p><p>LEVEL POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THE MEMORIAL. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH THE MEKONG DELTA PROVIDES </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF VIETNAM\'S RICE HARVEST, </p><p>CERTAIN AREAS, INCLUDING THE U MINH THUONG NATIONAL </p><p>PARK, REMAIN EXTREMELY POOR.  WHILE THE OFDA-FUNDED </p><p>PROJECT ALLEVIATED SOME OF THE IMMEDIATE MISERY </p><p>FOLLOWING THE FIRE, SUBSTANTIALLY MORE RESOURCES ARE </p><p>NECESSARY TO MEET BASIC HUMAN NEEDS.   AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, THE GVN\'S DECISION TO RESETTLE PEOPLE IN THE U </p><p>MINH THUONG NATIONAL PARK\'S BUFFER ZONE RAISES </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF THE PARK\'S </p><p>CONSERVATION MANDATE.  END COMMENT. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00779  02 OF 02  300824Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
