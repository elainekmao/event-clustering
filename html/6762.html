<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001789 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON WAR ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- The Jordanian print media today, March 25, </p><p>continues to focus on the war on Iraq.  Lead stories </p><p>focus on "fierce" battles in some Iraqi towns and the </p><p>resistance of the Iraqi people.  Another lead story, </p><p>carried under huge banner headlines, focuses on King </p><p>Abdullah\'s remarks to the Jordanian Upper House of </p><p>Parliament that Jordan will not allow its airspace "to </p><p>be used to attack Iraq". </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Be free, whether you like it or not!" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Nabil Sharif writes on the back page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/25):  "It is evident that America and Britain are </p><p>now feeling the crisis that the pro-Israel supporters </p><p>in the White House have put them in..  The Iraqi </p><p>people have thwarted the wagers of the invaders who </p><p>had wagered on a quick war with little resistance. </p><p>The most noble of `surprises\' achieved by the Iraqi </p><p>people that confused the invaders is probably this </p><p>determination to stand fast in Iraq and not to leave </p><p>Iraq.  Not a single Iraqi person left Iraq for the </p><p>refugee camps that were set up by international </p><p>organizations.  On the contrary, the border point </p><p>witnessed a mass Iraqi immigration back into Iraq to </p><p>participate with their people in the defense of their </p><p>homeland..  The invading forces are likely to escalate </p><p>the aggression and use excessive force to impose </p><p>`liberation\' on the Iraqi people, whether they like it </p><p>or not.  Despite the prevailing pessimism, now is the </p><p>time for creative diplomatic action that would find a </p><p>way for the invading forces out of their crisis and </p><p>would salvage the Iraqi people from the bloodbaths </p><p>that are planned by the invaders.  Is there anyone out </p><p>there who is willing to sound the bell to salvage the </p><p>Iraqi people?" </p><p> </p><p>-- "The gap between reality and expectations" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Urayb Rintawi writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/25):  "There is an American-British confusion in </p><p>managing the war on Iraq, a confusion that cannot </p><p>dampened by the `sure tone of voice\' of both </p><p>administrations in addressing their stances.  It is a </p><p>confusion that stems from the fact that the American </p><p>scheme has come in collision with a series of </p><p>surprises in the war operations..  Despite the misery </p><p>of the Iraqi media rhetoric and the Iraqi Minister of </p><p>Information\'s resort to the use of swear words, the </p><p>confidence in the Iraqi rhetoric so far is much higher </p><p>than that in the American and British rhetoric..  If </p><p>this continues, it is likely that the confusion is </p><p>going to escalate and then Washington would find </p><p>itself forced to adopt steps that would cover its </p><p>failure and the failure of its project.  The most </p><p>dangerous thing that could happen is for Washington to </p><p>resort to the use of impetuous and brute force to </p><p>speed up the conclusion of the battle.  This means </p><p>that promises of a quick and clean war would not be </p><p>abided by and that the coming unfolding chapters of </p><p>the war would carry the most serious of consequences." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The ferociousness of the media war and the loss of </p><p>the Arab media" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(03/25):  "Since the first day of the war, the </p><p>Americans adopted a media system that targets the </p><p>Iraqi people and tries to bring the people in line </p><p>with the American political rhetoric of `liberating </p><p>Iraq\'.  Yet, the credibility of the American media was </p><p>completely blown away when facts on the ground proved </p><p>the falseness of American claims..  The American anger </p><p>at publishing the photos of the dead and captured </p><p>Americans is justifiable, because, for the first time, </p><p>it showed the American people and the world that this </p><p>war is not picnic as envisaged by Mr. Rumsfeld.  Of </p><p>course, seeing dead people of any race or religion is </p><p>not amusing, and the American soldiers are, at the end </p><p>of the day, human beings with hopes and dreams </p><p>different from wanting to die so that American oil </p><p>companies can get contracts for the Iraqi oil or to </p><p>protect Israel.  However, publishing those photos was </p><p>a political necessity that made Mr. George Bush </p><p>realize that the war is not a computer game that can </p><p>be played without real American losses.  The problem </p><p>remains that truth is the first victim of the war, and </p><p>the conflict to win the media battle means that </p><p>professional and moral standards are going to be </p><p>thwarted." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
