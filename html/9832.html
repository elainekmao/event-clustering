<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004856 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: MORE ON DEHAP PLAN TO VISIT PKK/KADEK IN </p><p>IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 4848 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires a.i. Robert S. Deutsch. </p><p>Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) July 31, following delivery of reftel points to DEHAP </p><p>regarding the party\'s planned Aug. 4 delegation to PKK/KADEK </p><p>members in northern Iraq, Diyarbakir Mayor Feridun Celik, a </p><p>delegation leader, called in Ankara requesting a meeting. </p><p>(Note: as reported reftel, GOT officials had told us the </p><p>delegation was already in Iraq.  End note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) With Celik at the venue were two influential Kurds: 1) </p><p>Ihsan Arslan (strictly protect throughout), an AK Party </p><p>Diyarbakir M.P. and Kurdish activist close to P.M. Erdogan. </p><p>Arslan is also the de facto right-hand man of AK Vice </p><p>Chairman Firat on Kurdish issues; and 2) an independent </p><p>Kurdish source with excellent access to both Kurdish </p><p>nationalist and Islamic circles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) A/Polcouns reiterated reftel points to Celik, who </p><p>acknowledged them and offered the following: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The GOT\'s current reintegration law is like previous </p><p>versions and will not bring significant numbers of PKK/KADEK </p><p>members down from the mountains (note: a view shared by </p><p>Kurdish and other observers across the political spectrum. </p><p>End note); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The law comes in the context of rising tensions in the </p><p>Kurdish southeast.  The PKK/KADEK is preparing to go on the </p><p>offensive beginning September 1 unless the situation changes; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Consequently, the situation "is not as simple as just </p><p>passing a law calling for them (PKK/KADEK) to submit."  DEHAP </p><p>has legitimate political -- vice "propaganda" -- reasons for </p><p>making the trip: promoting peace and heading off a return to </p><p>violence.  The party\'s constituents are increasingly </p><p>concerned about the situation and are pressing for action by </p><p>DEHAP; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- DEHAP is fully aware that the elements of the Turkish </p><p>State could use the trip to retaliate against the party.  In </p><p>this regard, however, Celik noted that: 1) DEHAP is already </p><p>facing threat of closure; 2) "They (Turkish authorities) </p><p>already have Ocalan (incarcerated PKK leader), which means </p><p>they already have enough information" to shut DEHAP down at </p><p>any time; 3) DEHAP is convinced that it will not be allowed </p><p>to stand in the upcoming nationwide, local elections </p><p>(currently scheduled for spring 2004); DEHAP members are used </p><p>to having their parties shut down and going to jail. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Arslan: Could Be a Good Idea </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Arslan (strictly protect) offered that the DEHAP trip </p><p>might have a positive effect, though it entails risks.  It </p><p>may serve as a pretext for Turkish State pressure on DEHAP </p><p>that could also poison the general atmosphere in Turkey. </p><p>Celik interjected to A/Polcouns that senior AK members, </p><p>including Firat, had responded to DEHAP in a similarly </p><p>positive way regarding the planned delegation.  Arslan added </p><p>that the AK Government would never formally or publicly </p><p>endorse such a plan; nevertheless, he agreed to Celik\'s </p><p>request to try to broker another meeting for Celik with </p><p>Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Turkish press reports Aug. 1 that some 451 members of </p><p>a variety of terrorist organizations have applied for </p><p>"re-integration" under the law, even though it has yet to be </p><p>approved by President Sezer (and might in fact be vetoed). </p><p>The press also predicts that the figure may eventually reach </p><p>3,000; so far, there are no precise indications as to how </p><p>many of these applicants are or were once affiliated with the </p><p>PKK/KADEK.  In this context, it is worth noting, as the </p><p>Interior Ministry SecGen told us recently, that one feature </p><p>of the law is specifically designed to appeal to people still </p><p>in Turkey -- not, that is, hard-core PKK/KADEK elements in </p><p>Iraq -- who for various reasons may have provided food or </p><p>other support to PKK/KADEK and are now worried about their </p><p>situation.  The legal provision allowing such people to turn </p><p>themselves in without punishment is intended to last for only </p><p>six months after publication of the law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) There is clearly more going on here than a simple </p><p>DEHAP publicity stunt.  According to the independent Kurdish </p><p>source, Celik is trying to move DEHAP away from knee-jerk </p><p>response to PKK/KADEK equities; Celik\'s own comments to us </p><p>suggest as much.  The view of the AK official is particularly </p><p>noteworthy, given his connections and track record.  In 1996 </p><p>he visited northern Iraq as part of an unofficial delegation, </p><p>backed by then P.M. Erbakan, to make contact with PKK </p><p>representatives.  While AK would probably approve of anything </p><p>that would help bring the PKK down from the mountains, the </p><p>party brass will almost certainly ensure that their </p><p>fingerprints are nowhere near the DEHAP delegation -- should </p><p>DEHAP go though with its plan. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
