<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0417 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, TU, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  OHAL MENTALITY, IF NOT NAME, PERSISTS IN </p><p>TURKEY\'S SOUTHEAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ANKARA 8447;  (B) ANKARA 6116 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Although the GOT lifted the State of </p><p>Emergency in the Southeast (OHAL) November 30, vestiges </p><p>of OHAL rule and a siege mentality among security </p><p>personnel persist.  Kurds in the region continue to wait </p><p>for implementation of promised cultural freedoms, </p><p>including the right to teach the Kurdish language and </p><p>broadcast in Kurdish. This "wait-and-see" mentality </p><p>cannot be maintained indefinitely, and as time passes, </p><p>disappointment, and belief that meaningful reform will </p><p>not occur, grow.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>THE ROAD TO DIYARBAKIR </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) For years, four security checkpoints guarded the </p><p>road from Bingol to Diyarbakir.  According to Bingol </p><p>Mayor Feyzullah Karaaslan, people still are routinely </p><p>stopped, questioned about travel, and asked to produce </p><p>identification.  Karaaslan said he continues to be </p><p>subjected to significant unnecessary delays on this </p><p>route, which persist long after the ending of OHAL in </p><p>Bingol in 1997.  Passenger vehicles, trucks, tractors, </p><p>and buses are all regularly stopped.  In the case of </p><p>trucks, identification and cargo manifest must be </p><p>presented.  For buses, typically the driver must present </p><p>his identification and license. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Poloff was stopped for 20 minutes at one </p><p>checkpoint on the Bingol-Diyarbakir road, and questioned </p><p>about purpose of travel, parents\' names, previous </p><p>travel, length of time in Turkey, and point of arrival </p><p>in Turkey.  When asked why traffic jandarma had such </p><p>questions, they replied "for the safety of the people of </p><p>Diyarbakir.  How do we know you are who you say you </p><p>are?"  This, of course, despite the fact they were </p><p>holding a diplomatic ID issued by the MFA and could see </p><p>the vehicle\'s diplomatic plates.  At all checkpoints in </p><p>the three-hour drive, identification must be presented </p><p>and destination given. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>THE PERSISTENCE OF OHAL </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The State of Emergency lives on, both mentally and </p><p>bureaucratically, and there have been press reports </p><p>alleging the GOT plans to create a "Coordinating </p><p>Governorate" for the Southeast(see reftel A).  Whether </p><p>true or not, such reports raise doubts about the GOT\'s </p><p>future plans for the region.  Gov. Aydiner\'s OHAL </p><p>administration continues to exist in Diyarbakir, though </p><p>local political contacts indicated Aydiner has been </p><p>given approximately two months to close down and account </p><p>for all funding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Provincial governors with whom Poloff met in </p><p>Bingol, Elazig, and Malatya all said they are confident </p><p>that security in the region can be maintained post OHAL. </p><p>Bingol Deputy Governor Ibrahim Suha Karaboran said all </p><p>SUBJECT:  OHAL MENTALITY, IF NOT NAME, PERSISTS IN TURKEY\'S SOUTHEAST </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>concerns which OHAL oversaw could now competently be </p><p>handled on the provincial level.  Tunceli Governor </p><p>Mustafa Erkal concurred, saying that security issues had </p><p>taken a back seat to development and employment </p><p>concerns, and did not require super-provincial </p><p>authority.  (NOTE: Provincial governors have long found </p><p>their authority circumscribed by the OHAL </p><p>administration, and have an interest in defending their </p><p>security-based prerogatives.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>A KURD BY ANY OTHER NAME </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>6. (SBU) A raft of cultural-freedom laws was passed as part </p><p>of the August EU-harmonization package (reftel B). </p><p>However, implementation, both in the form of regulation </p><p>and mentality, has yet to occur.  No Kurdish-language </p><p>television broadcasts, radio programs, or courses are </p><p>yet in place.  Moreover, Kurds continue to chafe under </p><p>Birth Registry Law number 1587, which outlaws "names </p><p>which do not fit Turkey\'s national culture, moral rules, </p><p>customs or traditions, or which harm the general </p><p>public."  This law is often used to ban traditional </p><p>Kurdish names; the most recent case in which a parent </p><p>was charged with violation of this law was on November </p><p>26. In March, 25 Batman city council members were </p><p>acquitted on charges of separatist propaganda for </p><p>renaming local streets using Kurdish names. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) With or without OHAL, a restrictive mentality </p><p>persists among government and security officials in the </p><p>Southeast.  Promised reforms and expanded freedoms are </p><p>still pending.  Kurds\' expectations have been raised by </p><p>small liberalizing measures (like the increased </p><p>availability of Kurdish music on cassette and compact </p><p>disc), but could be easily dashed if promised reforms </p><p>are not followed through. End comment. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
