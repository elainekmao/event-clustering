<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 143823 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/07 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, UNSC, IZ, RU </p><p>SUBJECT: LETTER ON IRAQ FROM THE SECRETARY TO FM PRIMAKOV </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY NEA PDAS DAVID WELCH, REASON 1.5(B) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE FOR EMBASSY MOSCOW. SEE </p><p>PARA 4. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) BACKGROUND: ON AUGUST 4, THE SECRETARY RECEIVED A </p><p>LETTER FROM PRIMAKOV IN WHICH PRIMAKOV ASSERTED </p><p>CATEGORICALLY THAT IRAQ HAD ELIMINATED ALL WMD AND NO </p><p>LONGER RETAINED THE CAPACITY TO PRODUCE THEM, THAT BUTLER </p><p>HAD UNILATERALLY AND PREMATURELY CUT OFF TALKS WITH IRAQ, </p><p>AND THAT THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO TRANSITION THE NUCLEAR </p><p>FILE IMMEDIATELY. ON AUGUST 5, THE IRAQI REVOLUTIONARY </p><p>COMMAND COUNCIL ANNOUNCED THAT IRAQ WAS SUSPENDING </p><p>COOPERATION WITH UNSCOM AND IAEA, AND DEMANDING LIFTING </p><p>OFSANCTIONS AND A FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF UNSCOM. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACTION REQUESTED: EMBASSY MOSCOW SHOULD DELIVER THE </p><p>FOLLOWING LETTER TO FM PRIMAKOV AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. NO </p><p>ORIGINAL TO FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>DEAR YEVGENIY, </p><p> </p><p>I AM WRITING TO EXPRESS MY SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT IRAQ\'S </p><p>LATEST ACTIONS, AND TO RESPOND TO YOUR LETTER. </p><p> </p><p>I\'M CONFIDENT YOU ARE AS APPALLED AS I BY IRAQ\'S LATEST </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO EVADE ITS OBLIGATIONS AND TO UNILATERALLY </p><p>REWRITE THE RULES LAID DOWN BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL. THIS </p><p>ASSAULT ON THE INTEGRITY AND AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS CANNOT BE TOLERATED. WE MUST RESPOND WITH STRONG, </p><p>UNIFIED ACTION WHICH MAKES CLEAR THAT NO NATION HAS THE </p><p>RIGHT TO FLOUT ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND THE WILL </p><p>OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL. </p><p> </p><p>I AM SURE THAT YOU DID NOT ANTICIPATE IRAQ\'S ACTIONS WHEN </p><p>YOU WROTE YOUR LETTER WHICH IMPLIED THAT CHAIRMAN BUTLER </p><p>WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PRECIPITATING A BREAKDOWN. THE </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL\'S STATEMENT MAKES CLEAR THAT </p><p>IRAQ HAS NO RESPECT FOR UNSCOM, THE UNITED NATIONS AND </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE SECURITY COUNCIL, THE COUNCIL\'S </p><p>RESOLUTIONS, THE FEBRUARY 23 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING, </p><p>OR THE SECRETARY GENERAL WHO NEGOTIATED THAT AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WHEN IRAQ BEGAN THIS STANDOFF BY ISSUING UNREASONABLE </p><p>PRECONDITIONS FOR THE CONTINUATION OF TALKS, CHAIRMAN </p><p>BUTLER IMMEDIATELY CONSULTED WITH SECRETARY GENERAL ANNAN </p><p>AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL, BOTH OF WHOM </p><p>SUPPORTED THE DECISION TO DEPART IRAQ.   MR. BUTLER HAS NOT </p><p>SUSPENDED UNSCOM\'S ACTIVITIES IN IRAQ; TARIQ AZIZ BROKE OFF </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH THE UNSCOM CHAIRMAN. IRAQ HAS NOW </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS SUSPENDING COOPERATION WITH UNSCOM AND </p><p>THE IAEA. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ HAS CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL\'S REQUIREMENTS FOR FULL DISCLOSURE OF ITS WEAPONS </p><p>OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND MISSILE PROGRAMS. IT IS THIS </p><p>FAILURE TO COMPLY, TOGETHER WITH IRAQ\'S REFUSAL TO </p><p>COOPERATE WITH UNSCOM AND IAEA -- IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL\'S MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING AND U.N. </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1154 -- WHICH CONTINUE TO DELAY </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL ACTION, ESPECIALLY ACTION TO TRANSITION </p><p>THE NUCLEAR FILE. THE MAY SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>STATEMENT CLEARLY LAID OUT WHAT IS REQUIRED BEFORE THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL WOULD CONSIDER TRANSITIONING THE NUCLEAR </p><p>FILE. AS THE RECENT IAEA REPORT TO THE COUNCIL MADE CLEAR, </p><p>IRAQ HAS NOT RESPONDED TO ANY OF THE OUTSTANDING CONCERNS. </p><p>EVEN THOUGH IRAQ HAS NO DIFFICULTY CONVENING ITS SO-CALLED </p><p>PARLIAMENT TO DENOUNCE UNSCOM, IT HAS FAILED TO PASS A </p><p>PENAL LAW WHICH TARIQ AZIZ ACKNOWLEDGED WAS AN </p><p>"INESCAPABLE" PRECONDITION FOR TRANSITIONING THE FILE. </p><p> </p><p>YEVGENIY, THE FACTS CONTRADICT YOUR CLAIM THAT IRAQ DOES </p><p>NOT POSSESS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION OR THE CAPACITY TO </p><p>MANUFACTURE THEM, AND I FURTHER BELIEVE RUSSIA WOULD NOT </p><p>FIND SUPPORT FOR THAT OPINION ELSEWHERE. DESPITE IRAQI </p><p>CLAIMS THAT IT HAS COOPERATED FULLY WITH UNSCOM AND </p><p>PROVIDED FULL DISCLOSURE, UNSCOM HAS REPEATEDLY UNCOVERED </p><p>NEW EVIDENCE OF IRAQ\'S PROGRAM TO DEVELOP WEAPONS OF MASS </p><p>DESTRUCTION. AS UNSCOM\'S DISCOVERY IN JUNE OF WEAPONIZED </p><p>VX -- SOMETHING IRAQ HAD CONSISTENTLY DENIED HAVING -- </p><p>MAKES CLEAR, THE FULL EXTENT OF IRAQ\'S WEAPONS OF MASS </p><p>DESTRUCTION PROGRAM IS STILL UNKNOWN.   I FOUND YOUR </p><p>STATEMENTS AT THAT TIME TO BE VERY HELPFUL, AND AM </p><p>PERPLEXED AND SURPRISED THAT YOU WOULD TAKE A DIFFERENT </p><p>POSITION NOW. FOR THE SECURITY OF THE REGION, WE MUST KNOW </p><p>WHAT IRAQ HAS DEVELOPED AND IS CAPABLE OF DEVELOPING. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ\'S REFUSAL TO COOPERATE WITH UNSCOM AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE </p><p>THE LEGITIMACY OF RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL IS UNACCEPTABLE. UNTIL IRAQ RESUMES COOPERATION </p><p>WITH UNSCOM, THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE COUNCIL TO HOLD </p><p>SANCTIONS REVIEWS. THEREFORE, WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER FOR </p><p>A COUNCIL DECISION TO SUSPEND SANCTIONS REVIEWS </p><p>INDEFINITELY, UNTIL THEY RESUME FULL COOPERATION. THIS, </p><p>YEVGENIY, IS A MINIMUM NECESSARY FIRST STEP. UNLESS THE </p><p>COUNCIL ACTS RESPONSIBLY TO COUNTER IRAQ\'S OBSTRUCTIONISM, </p><p>WE WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER OTHER AVAILABLE OPTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>SINCERELY, </p><p>MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PICKERING </p><p></p></div>
