MLAT: The Ambassador, accompanied by Polchief </p><p>and POL FSN, met 5/31 with UAE Minister of Justice, </p><p>Awqaf and Islamic Affairs Muhammad Nakhira Al- </p><p>Dhaheri.  The Ambassador engaged Al-Dhaheri on the </p><p>draft Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, noting that, </p><p>following the exchange of proposed changes, the </p><p>U.S. was prepared to begin negotiations in the near </p><p>future.  The Ambassador proposed a discussion of </p><p>preliminary matters via video teleconference.  Al- </p><p>Dhaheri agreed on the need to proceed, but asked </p><p>that the VTC incorporate a discussion of </p><p>longstanding and unmet UAE requests to the USG </p><p>related to judicial matters.  The Ambassador </p><p>demurred that such a discussion should occur in a </p><p>separate forum.  (Note:  We will meet with Ministry </p><p>of Justice officials to ascertain the nature of </p><p>these concerns.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  EXTRADITION TREATY:  The Minister expressed the </p><p>UAEG\'s desire to move forward with negotiations on </p><p>a draft extradition treaty concurrent with MLAT </p><p>negotiations.  The Ambassador, noting the minor </p><p>changes to the MLAT suggested by both sides, hoped </p><p>that we could conclude that agreement and then open </p><p>discussions on an extradition treaty.  The Minister </p><p>took the Ambassador\'s point on board. </p><p> </p><p>3.  TIP:  The Ambassador asked the Minister for an </p><p>update on the status of the draft law criminalizing </p><p>the use of underage camel jockeys.  Al-Dhaheri </p><p>briefed that the legislation is with the Supreme </p><p>Council of Rulers pending the signature of the </p><p>rulers of all seven emirates.  Once the other six </p><p>emirate rulers have signed, the legislation will be </p><p>sent to UAE President and Abu Dhabi Ruler Zayid bin </p><p>Sultan Al-Nahyan\'s office for his signature.  With </p><p>Zayid\'s signature, the legislation becomes law. </p><p>Al-Dhaheri could not predict how long the process </p><p>would take, but did not expect it to be too drawn </p><p>out. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
