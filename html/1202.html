(C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD CALLED MINISTER OF JUSTICE, </p><p>LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS EMMERSON MNANGAGWA THE </p><p>AFTERNOON OF JULY 4 TO LEARN WHERE ZIMBABWE STANDS ON </p><p>THE QUESTION OF FORMER BOTSWANA PRESIDENT SIR KETUMILE </p><p>MASIRE REMAINING AS THE NATIONAL OIALOGUE FACILITATOR IN </p><p>THE CONGO.  NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION DIRECTLY, THE </p><p>MINISTER, WHO IS PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S POINT MAN ON </p><p>SENSITIVE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE CONGO, INFORMED THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HE, AND MAYBE A </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTRY REPRESENTATIVE, PLANNED TO TRAVEL TO </p><p>LUBUMBASHI AT A STILL UNSPECIFIED DATE THE WEEK OF JULY </p><p>10 TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT KABILA AND HIS ADVISORS TO </p><p>DISCUSS THIS AND OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO THE CONGO. </p><p>MNANGAGWA WOULD NOT BE DRAWN ON WHETHER PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>WOULD USE HIS INFLUENCE TO PUSH KABILA FURTHER TO </p><p>REVERSE HIS PUBLIC STAND AGAINST MASIRE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THEN TOLD THE MINISTER THAT </p><p>WASHINGTON WAS SEIZED WITH THE ISSUE AND HOPED THAT </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE COULD PREVAIL ON HIS CONGOLESE </p><p>COUNTERPART TO ACCEPT MASIRE.  THE MINISTER AND THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF SPECIAL ENVOY </p><p>HOWARD WOLPE VISITING HARARE SOON TO DISCUSS THESE </p><p>ISSUES AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT.

(C) COMMENT: CLEARLY MUGABE WANTS TO BRING HIS </p><p>TROOPS HOME, BUT WE SENSE THAT HE WILL NOT FALL ON HIS </p><p>SWORD TO PRESERVE MASIRE IN THE ROLE OF FACILITATOR. </p><p>MUGABE\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH KABILA IS TOO IMPORTANT TO </p><p>HIM TO SPOIL IT OVER AN ISSUE OF PRINCIPLE THAT PROBABLY </p><p>IS NOT VITAL TO ZIMBABWE.  WE WELCOME A VISIT BY S/E </p><p>WOLPE TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE, BUT SUGGEST HE NOT COME WITH </p><p>GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF PERSUADING THE ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>OTHERWISE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
