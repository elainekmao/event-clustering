<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 002456 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU, OVIP </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAITIS VERY DISAPPOINTED AT POTUS CANCELLATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) During their June 4 meeting, MinState for Foreign </p><p>Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed al-Sabah shared with the </p><p>Ambassador Kuwait\'s extreme disappointment at the </p><p>cancellation of POTUS\' visit to Kuwait.  Dr. Mohammed led off </p><p>the meeting by noting that the Kuwaiti people had looked </p><p>forward to the visit as an opportunity to show their </p><p>gratitude and sincere appreciation to President Bush, for </p><p>whom he said all Kuwaitis have "enormous respect." </p><p>Unfortunately, the height of their original expectations was </p><p>now matched by the depth of their disappointment. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador agreed that the opportunity for the </p><p>Kuwaiti people to personally show their support for the </p><p>President would have been a welcome one, but noted that the </p><p>President would be telephoning the Amir and Shaykh Sabah and </p><p>he understood they planned to discuss the possibility of a </p><p>future visit. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment:  The local popular impact of the cancellation </p><p>and importance of trying to reschedule such a visit should </p><p>not be underestimated.  Kuwaitis are genuinely and deeply </p><p>appreciative of all that the US has done for Kuwait under the </p><p>leadership of both POTUS and his father.  The special </p><p>relationship between our two countries is one that Kuwaitis </p><p>feel very personally, and they remain eager to show their </p><p>support for President Bush.  A POTUS visit to Kuwait at an </p><p>appropriate early date would be an enormous gesture of </p><p>goodwill, especially when one considers Kuwait\'s very </p><p>significant and very public support of the U.S. and coalition </p><p>efforts in Iraq. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
