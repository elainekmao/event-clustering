<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 FRANKFURT 005937 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SMIG, SOCI, PGOV, PREF, PHUM, GM </p><p>SUBJECT: "RUSSIAN-GERMANS": IMMIGRATION AND INTEGRATION </p><p>PROBLEMS IN SOUTHWEST GERMANY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: The immigration and integration of ethnic </p><p>Germans and their families from the former Soviet Union </p><p>(Aussiedler) is a major social problem in Germany. </p><p>Newcomers\' lack of German language skills makes them </p><p>unemployable and drug-related crimes and ghettoization are </p><p>endemic among Aussiedler youth.  Government efforts at </p><p>promoting Aussiedler well-being and integration focus on </p><p>programs intended to help them improve their German language </p><p>skills.  Although the number of Aussiedler has steadily </p><p>diminished since the early 1990s, the Aussiedler already in </p><p>Germany remain a festering social problem for which no </p><p>comprehensive solution has been implemented by the federal </p><p>or state governments. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Who are the "Aussiedler?" </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Aussiedler are descendents of Germans who were </p><p>immigrated to Russia beginning in the 18th century when </p><p>Czarina Catherine the Great, born into the German </p><p>aristocracy, invited Germans to settle in Russia.  There was </p><p>continuous migration of Germans to Russian lands up until </p><p>the beginning of the Soviet Union.  When Nazi Germany </p><p>invaded the Soviet Union, Stalin had the Aussiedler deported </p><p>to Soviet Central Asia.  The 1949 Constitution of the </p><p>Federal Republic of Germany re-codified the longstanding </p><p>ethnic concept of German nationality; ethnic Germans were </p><p>guaranteed the right to German residence and citizenship. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Following the fall of the Iron Curtain, ethnic </p><p>Germans from the Soviet Union were in a position to take </p><p>advantage of the citizenship law as well.  Beginning in the </p><p>1990s, whole communities left the former Soviet Union to </p><p>settle in Germany.  In addition to those who could prove </p><p>German ethnicity, family members including non-German </p><p>spouses and children were allowed to immigrate as well.  In </p><p>response to the sudden surge in immigrants, the FRG set a </p><p>cap of 220,000 Aussiedler immigrants per year in 1993, and </p><p>in the same year enacted a new regulation requiring ethnic </p><p>German principals to pass a German language competency test. </p><p>Approximately 30 percent of applicants fail the test, which </p><p>supplements genealogical data to establish the applicants\' </p><p>ethnic German bona fides.  The annual number of Aussiedler </p><p>moving to Germany has decreased steadily and the cap has </p><p>never actually been met.  In 2002, 91,000 Aussiedler </p><p>immigrated to Germany.  Germany had targeted aid to </p><p>Aussiedler communities abroad to improve local conditions </p><p>and stem the flow, for example to ethnic German families in </p><p>Kazakhstan who were interested in resettlement in Siberia or </p><p>the Volga region of Russia.  Such resettlement in Russia has </p><p>proved much less attractive to most of Centra Asia\'s ethnic </p><p>Germans than the possibility of starting a new life in </p><p>Germany. </p><p> </p><p>The Aussiedler in Southwest Germany </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Aussiedler were settled in Germany according to a </p><p>fixed formula in order to avoid what government officials </p><p>called in the mid-1990s "bunching."  Hesse accepted 7.2 </p><p>percent of all Aussiedler immigrants and Baden-Wuerttemberg </p><p>(B-W) 12.4 percent.  (In B-W, this meant 11,245 persons in </p><p>2002; 12,093 in 2001; and 11,749 in 2000.)  Almost 95 </p><p>percent comes from the former Soviet Union (statistics do </p><p>not distinguish between Russia and the central Asian </p><p>republics, but German government officials believe that </p><p>former Russian and Kazakh nationals dominate this group.) </p><p>Many Germans do not perceive Aussiedler as Germans and </p><p>normally refer to them as "Russians" regardless of their </p><p>actual ethnicity.  Only 25 percent of the Aussiedler are </p><p>actually ethnic Germans.  The remaining 75 percent are </p><p>spouses and family members, often with no German background </p><p>or German language skills at all. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Many Germans associate Aussiedler, particularly the </p><p>youth, with drugs and crime.  Media reporting, sometimes </p><p>exaggerated, perpetuates this view.  Aussiedler are </p><p>frequently mentioned in connection with organized crime. </p><p>The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported three cases of </p><p>human trafficking involving ethnic Germans from Russia in </p><p>recent months.  Papers in the Frankfurt area attribute the </p><p>emergence of a new and stronger form of heroin to Aussiedler </p><p>drug gangs.  The Associated Press reported that in July 2002 </p><p>four Aussiedler were caught attacking an Iranian woman and </p><p>her son near Frankfurt.  The article spoke of a "new breed </p><p>of right-wing extremism" growing among the Aussiedler </p><p>against other foreigners in Germany. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The "drugs and crime" stereotype contains some </p><p>truth: Aussiedler youth tend to be more involved in criminal </p><p>activity.  According to a 2002 police survey, every tenth </p><p>German juvenile offender was of ethnic Russian origin. </p><p>However, a spokesperson for the Frankfurt police cautioned </p><p>us not to view Aussiedler as more criminal than Germans. </p><p> </p><p>The Drug Problem </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Particularly worrying to local officials is an </p><p>increase in drug abuse and drug-related crimes among young </p><p>Aussiedler.  Rheinland-Pfalz (R-P) statistics document that </p><p>in urban areas with a high percentage of Aussiedler -- such </p><p>as the industrial city of Ludwigshafen home to the </p><p>multinational giant BASF -- every fourth person involved in </p><p>drugs is an Aussiedler.  The police in R-P and other states </p><p>have also noticed an increase in violent crimes and a </p><p>growing number of HIV and tuberculosis among incarcerated </p><p>Aussiedler.  One expert, Irene Troester, from Hohenheim </p><p>University near Stuttgart, states that there is a </p><p>misconception that young Aussiedler "imported" the drug </p><p>problem to Germany.  She is the author of a comprehensive </p><p>study on Aussiedler and says that almost all these young </p><p>immigrants become involved with drugs after they arrive in </p><p>Germany.  Troester, who immigrated from Kazakhstan at the </p><p>age of seven, says that young Aussiedler are under great </p><p>social and economic pressure.  Already steeped in social </p><p>customs of heavy drinking, they turn to alcohol at age 14 or </p><p>15 and are then easily lured to drugs. </p><p> </p><p>Social Isolation </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Many Aussiedler perceive an unwelcoming attitude </p><p>among native Germans, which probably contributes to the </p><p>social isolation of the community.  Most Aussiedler are </p><p>settled in groups of over 100 in dedicated, often </p><p>geographically isolated apartment complexes.  Cities </p><p>received subsidies for taking in Aussiedler in the 1990s and </p><p>built large housing complexes as the most economic means of </p><p>accommodation, and some were placed in renovated former </p><p>military facilities.  According to Troester, politicians </p><p>often preferred to concentrate Aussiedler in one area in </p><p>order to avoid social problems they feared would be </p><p>associated with contact between native Germans and the </p><p>immigrants.  "Then only one neighborhood goes bad," said </p><p>Troester. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Some Germans look upon the government\'s support of </p><p>Aussiedler with frustration and anger.  Aussiedler receive </p><p>more housing assistance than many Germans or other </p><p>immigrants.  Immigrants with large families, are entitled to </p><p>bigger homes.  This creates the perception that an </p><p>Aussiedler family with poor German and few marketable skills </p><p>receives preferential treatment while other Germans and non- </p><p>German immigrants receive less.  There is also a widespread </p><p>perception that many Aussiedler have fraudulently claimed </p><p>German ethnicity.  The problems of crime and drug abuse have </p><p>further increased calls for an end to the "coddling" of </p><p>Aussiedler and their families. </p><p> </p><p>Language As Key for Integration </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Government experts agree that acquiring language </p><p>skills is considered key for successful integration into </p><p>German society.  According to Herbert Rech (CDU), the B-W </p><p>commissioner for Aussiedler, young immigrants do not feel </p><p>sufficiently compelled to learn German.  The B-W Social </p><p>Democratic (SPD) Caucus Chief Wolfgang Drexler welcomed </p><p>Rech\'s comments saying, "The CDU is finally facing reality </p><p>concerning the Aussiedler community."  To improve the </p><p>integration of Aussiedler, B-W is running a model project </p><p>known as the "integration guide."  Newly arrived Aussiedler </p><p>sign a contract that lists their rights and obligations.  A </p><p>social worker then acts as an advisor for the immigrant and </p><p>assists in the integration effort.  B-W spends 4.4 million </p><p>Euro annually for integrating Aussiedler and is thus a </p><p>leader in southwest Germany. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Hesse has no comprehensive Aussiedler policy, but </p><p>spends 655,000 Euro to support so called "expellee </p><p>organizations" (Vertriebenenverbaende). (NOTE: The name </p><p>dates back to the ethnic Germans who were expelled from </p><p>Eastern Europe in the immediate postwar period and </p><p>subsequently formed support groups.)  Many Aussiedler do not </p><p>consider the associations helpful, however.  "They only care </p><p>for people, who fled after the war, not those coming today," </p><p>Troester said. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) The Aussiedler problem points up weaknesses in </p><p>German immigration policy.  The Constitutional requirement </p><p>and political pressures that led to Germany\'s acceptance of </p><p>large numbers of Aussiedler in the early 1990s marked the </p><p>first time in Germany\'s history that the government had to </p><p>develop a management plan for large-scale immigration and </p><p>integration.  As efforts to reform Germany\'s immigration law </p><p>continue, there is a tendency for experts as well as </p><p>politicians to call on approaches used to deal with </p><p>Aussiedler in handling other immigrants.  However, the </p><p>Aussiedler actually represent a very special type of </p><p>immigrant, quite different from the skilled workers that </p><p>German immigration experts increasingly point to as the </p><p>future of German immigration and, indeed, of the German </p><p>population.  Unlike economic migrants under a Canadian </p><p>immigration model, Aussiedler lack concrete reasons to learn </p><p>German and adapt to German society; they are both coddled </p><p>and isolated by the German government.  Although the number </p><p>of Aussiedler settling in Germany continues to decline, the </p><p>large number already living in Southwest German remain a </p><p>festering social problem.  There are indications that this </p><p>problem might be exacerbated by the Southwest\'s increasing </p><p>role as a preferred residence for Aussiedler originally </p><p>settled in Eastern states, whose native populations have </p><p>reputations for being especially unwelcoming.
