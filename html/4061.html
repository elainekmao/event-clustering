<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 005184 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/23/2007 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, PREL, PREL, IT, ITMOPS, ITMOPS, IRAQI FREEDOM </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTION TO ENDURING FREEDOM: U/S </p><p>FEITH\'S MEETING WITH MINDEF MARTINO, SEPT. 30 </p><p> </p><p>REF: ROME 4807 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLMINCOUNS THOMAS M. COUNTRYMAN, REASON 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  ON SEPTEMBER 30, ITALIAN MINDEF MARTINO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05184  01 OF 03  232138Z </p><p>REVIEWED OEF, ISAF/AFGHANISTAN DEVELOPMENTS, IRAQ, DEFENSE </p><p>PROCUREMENT, AND THE ICC WITH USD/P FEITH.  MARTINO </p><p>PINPOINTED MARCH 1 AS THE TARGET DATE FOR DEPLOYING THE </p><p>ALPINI TO AFGHANISTAN (COMMENT: PER REFTEL, THE PARLIAMENT ON </p><p>OCTOBER 3 APPROVED THE MISSION.)  ITALY\'S KFOR COMMAND ROLE </p><p>AND BUDGET CONSTRAINTS--WHICH MARTINO SAID WERE HAMPERING </p><p>DEFENSE PLANNING--WILL PREVENT THE GOI FROM TAKING ON ANY </p><p>ISAF OR ISAF-LIKE LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITIES AT THIS TIME. </p><p>THE THREAT OF MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ STRENGTHENS THE </p><p>UN, MARTINO SAID.  HE SPECIFIED THAT A DECISION TO USE FORCE </p><p>WAS A SEPARATE MATTER, BUT THOUGHT THAT IF THE U.S. MOVES TO </p><p>ASSEMBLE A MILITARY COALITION, FRANCE, RUSSIA, AND EVEN </p><p>GERMANY WOULD PARTICIPATE.  REGARDING ITALY\'S DESIRE TO SIGN </p><p>A DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES WITH THE U.S., FEITH NOTED THAT </p><p>COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH THIRD COUNTRIES WAS STILL AN ISSUE, </p><p>BUT SAID IT WAS SOLUBLE.  THE DEFENSE MINISTRY IS STUDYING </p><p>HOW TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE ICC ON PEACEKEEPING </p><p>OPERATIONS.  MARTINO CALLED AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT A GOOD, </p><p>IF IMPERFECT, STOPGAP TO MEET U.S. NEEDS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) USD/P FEITH MET SEPTEMBER 30 WITH ITALIAN MINDEF </p><p>MARTINO AT THE PARLIAMENT BUILDING IN ROME.  ALSO IN </p><p>ATTENDANCE WERE AMB. SEMBLER, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY PETER FLORY, MARTINO\'S DIPLOMATIC COUNSELOR </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>FRANCESCO TRUPIANO, AND POLMINCOUNS. </p><p> </p><p>ALPINI TROOPS TO OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) FEITH NOTED MARTINO\'S STATEMENT TO SECDEF SEPT. 23 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05184  01 OF 03  232138Z </p><p>THAT THE ALPINI BATTALION </p><p>THE GOI HAD PROMISED TO DEPLOY TO OEF WOULD ARRIVE IN MARCH, </p><p>AND STRESSED THAT AN </p><p>EARLIER ARRIVAL WOULD BE FAR MORE VALUABLE.  MARTINO SAID </p><p>AGAIN THAT THE TARGET </p><p>DATE WAS MARCH 1, SAYING THAT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE </p><p>ALPINI AND </p><p>ASSOCIATED UNITS HAVE THE TIME FOR INTEGRATED TRAINING.  HE </p><p>MENTIONED THAT </p><p>CONSTRAINTS ON THE DEFENSE BUDGET WERE ALSO A FACTOR. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MARTINO DESCRIBED THE GOI\'S APPROACH TO THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE ON OEF </p><p>AND AFGHANISTAN SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 3.  THERE WOULD BE NO </p><p>CONTROVERSY IF IT </p><p>WERE A QUESTION OF INCREASING ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTION TO ISAF. </p><p>HOWEVER, SOME </p><p>ELEMENTS OF THE LEFT IN ITALY HAVE CREATED A MYTH THAT </p><p>ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTION </p><p>OF OEF IS INTENDED TO FREE UP US ELEMENTS TO PROSECUTE WAR IN </p><p>IRAQ.  THE CLIMATE </p><p>HAS CHANGED SINCE THE PARLIAMENT VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY IN </p><p>NOVEMBER 2001 TO APPROVE </p><p>ITALIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO OEF.  NOW THE LEFT HAS RESURRECTED </p><p>ITS SLOGAN OF BEING </p><p>"PRO-PEACE" AND ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY </p><p>MARTINO, OF BEING WAR-MONGERS. </p><p>FEITH NOTED THAT THE IMPLICATION OF OPPOSING COALITION </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN OEF IS TO </p><p>PROMOTE WHAT THE LEFT CLAIMS TO REJECT: US UNILATERALISM. </p><p>SMILING, MARTINO SAID HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05184  01 OF 03  232138Z </p><p>PRESENTATION TO PARLIAMENT WOULD MAKE HIS FRIENDS ON THE LEFT </p><p>SQUIRM.  A VOTE ON OEF </p><p>WILL NOT ONLY SPLIT THE TWO MAIN OPPOSITION PARTIES - THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC LEFT (DS) AND </p><p>THE DAISY - BUT WOULD ALSO CAUSE AN INTERNAL SPLIT IN THE DS. </p><p> </p><p>ISAF </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MARTINO ASKED FOR LATEST US THINKING ON THE NEXT LEAD </p><p>NATION FOR ISAF: WOULD </p><p>IT BE THE GERMAN-DUTCH COMBINATION?  FEITH SAID HE HAD </p><p>DISCUSSED THIS IN BERLIN EARLIER </p><p>IN THE MONTH, BUT AFTER A WEEK ON THE ROAD, WAS NOT AWARE OF </p><p>THE LATEST THINKING </p><p>IN WASHINGTON.  A GERMAN-DUTCH OPERATION WOULD NEED SUPPORT, </p><p>AT LEAST INFORMALLY, </p><p>FROM NATO, WHICH RAISED SOME DIFFICULT QUESTIONS IN ITSELF. </p><p>WE WERE ALSO THINKING </p><p>ABOUT USING COALITION FORCES (FROM OEF) TO PERFORM ISAF-LIKE </p><p>FUNCTIONS IN CITIES </p><p>NOT CURRENTLY COVERED BY ISAF.  HE ASKED MARTINO IF ANY OTHER </p><p>NATION WAS READY TO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8606 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05184  02 OF 03  232139Z </p><p>ACTION PM-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------FD099D  232139Z /40 </p><p>P 231359Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6518 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 005184 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/23/2007 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTION TO ENDURING FREEDOM: U/S </p><p>FEITH\'S MEETING WITH MINDEF MARTINO, SEPT. 30 </p><p> </p><p>STEP FORWARD AND TAKE THE LEAD.  MARTINO NOTED THE IMMINENT </p><p>ITALIAN ASSUMPTION OF </p><p>KFOR COMMAND, AND REFERRED TO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AS A REASON </p><p>ITALY COULD NOT VOLUNTEER. </p><p> </p><p>AFGHANISTAN DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05184  02 OF 03  232139Z </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) FEITH DESCRIBED SOME OF HIS IMPRESSIONS FROM HIS </p><p>JUST-COMPLETED VISIT TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO SPEED THE TRAINING </p><p>OF THE AFGHAN ARMY </p><p>AND POLICE, SO THAT WE CAN GIVE THE GOA MORE RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR THE COUNTRY AND </p><p>AVOID CREATING A CULTURE OF OVERDEPENDENCE ON OUTSIDE HELP. </p><p>MARTINO AGREED, </p><p>NOTING THAT OVER-RELIANCE ON THE WEST WAS STILL A MAJOR </p><p>PROBLEM IN THE BALKANS. </p><p>FEITH SAID WE HAVE TO BUILD UP THE GOA\'S TOOLS, PARTICULARLY </p><p>THE POLICE AND A </p><p>MEANS FOR THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO BECOME THE CHIEF CONDUIT </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL AID. </p><p>WHEN HE MENTIONED HIS MEETING WITH MINDEF FAHIM KHAN, MARTINO </p><p>INTERJECTED THAT </p><p>FAHIM REMINDED HIM OF A REAL SICILIAN GODFATHER.  FEITH SAID </p><p>THAT OUR TASK WITH </p><p>FAHIM IS TO CONVINCE HIM THAT POLITICAL MANEUVERING WILL GIVE </p><p>HIM MORE OF A PAYBACK </p><p>THAN THE BRUTE FORCE HE IS USED TO WIELDING. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) FEITH SAID THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GIVING A GREAT </p><p>EAL OF THOUGHT TO </p><p>THE AFTERMATH OF SADDAM\'S REMOVL FROM POWER.  THERE WILL BE </p><p>A NEED FOR INTERNATONAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  05184  02 OF 03  232139Z </p><p>HELP IN ANY POST-CONFLICT STABILITY PHASE. MARTINO SAID IT </p><p>WAS IMPORTANT THAT </p><p>PUBLIC OPINON KNOW THAT THE US IS COMMITTED TO IRAQ\'S </p><p>STABIITY POST-SADDAM, </p><p>BECAUSE WE ARE CURRENTLY LOSING HE PROPAGANDA BATTLE.  HE </p><p>AGAIN COMPLAINED THAT </p><p>THE LEFT IS TRYING TO SIMPLIFY THE CHOICE BETWEEN"PEACE" AND </p><p>"WAR", WHEN IN FACT </p><p>IS WEIGHING TH RISK OF ACTION AGAINST THE RISK OF INACTION. </p><p>HESAID THAT THE US </p><p>WAS RIGHT TO CONTINUE THE PRESSUE ON BAGHDAD; WITHOUT THE </p><p>THREAT OF FORCE, THE U </p><p>WAS SEVERELY WEAKENED.  THE ACTUAL USE OF FORCE HE NOTED, </p><p>WAS A SEPARATE DECISION. </p><p>MARTINO SAD HE WAS LESS PESSIMISTIC THAN MOST ON THE </p><p>STRENTH OF A COALITION THE US </p><p>COULD ASSEMBLE: IN THE ED, HE BELIEVED THAT FRANCE, RUSSIA </p><p>AND EVEN GERMNY WOULD </p><p>NOT WANT TO BE LEFT OUT. </p><p> </p><p>BILATERAL: ECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) MARTINO SAID HIS DIRECTOR O ARMAMENTS HA ASKED HIM </p><p>TO RAISE WITH FEITH </p><p>ITLY\'S DESIRE TO SIGN A PROCUREMENT "DECLARATION OF </p><p>PRINCIPLES" SIMILAR TO THOSE </p><p>THE US HAD SIGNED ITH SPAIN AND OTHER ALLIES.  FEITH NOTED </p><p>THAT THRE WAS ONE </p><p>SENSITIVE ISSUE WITH REGARD TO COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH </p><p>THIR COUNTRIES THAT HAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05184  02 OF 03  232139Z </p><p>TO BE SETTLED, BUT THAT THISWAS A SOLUBLE ISSUE.  HE TOLD </p><p>MARTINO THAT HE HA </p><p>ALREADY ASKED EMBASSY ROME TO RESOLVE THIS. </p><p> </p><p>ITERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) REFERRING TO THE EUROPEAN UNION DCISION EXPECTED THE </p><p>SAME DAY ON NEGOTIATING </p><p>ARICLE 98 AGREEMENTS WITH THE US, FEITH SAID THAT TH ICC </p><p>WAS A RADICAL DEPARTURE </p><p>IN INTERNATIONAL LW.  THOSE WHO HAD BECOME PARTIES TO THE </p><p>STATUTE ERE LEGISLATING </p><p>FOR THOSE WHO HAD NOT; THE US COLD NOT ACCEPT SUCH AN </p><p>IMPOSITION.  MARTINO SAID HAT </p><p>HE HAD ASKED HIS STAFF TO ASSESS HOW TO MINIIZE THE IMPACT </p><p>OF THE ICC ON PEACEKEEPING </p><p>OPERAIONS, NOTING THAT AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WAS IMPEFECT </p><p>FOR THE US NEEDS, BUT </p><p>A GOOD STOP-GAP.  FITH SAID THAT THE USG WOULD BE OBLIGED TO </p><p>CONSIDR THE ICC AS </p><p>A NEW RISK FACTOR IN DECIDING WHICHMISSIONS TO EMBARK UPON; </p><p>IN MARGINAL CASES, IT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8607 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  05184  03 OF 03  232139Z </p><p>ACTION PM-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   CIAE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------FD09A9  232139Z /40 </p><p>P 231359Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6519 </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>INFO NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 005184 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/23/2007 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY\'S CONTRIBUTION TO ENDURING FREEDOM: U/S </p><p>FEITH\'S MEETING WITH MINDEF MARTINO, SEPT. 30 </p><p> </p><p>COULD BE THE FACTOR THAT CAUSES THE US NOT TO UNDERTAKE A </p><p>MISSION.  IT WILL ALSO </p><p>BECOME PART OF OUR DEFENSE RELATIONSHIP WITH FRIENDS. </p><p>MARTINO SAID THE WORLD WOULD </p><p>THEN BE THE LOSER, AND OFFERED TO HELP, PERHAPS BY WRITING AN </p><p>OP-ED COLUMN FOR THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  05184  03 OF 03  232139Z </p><p>ITALIAN PRESS.  FEITH SAID ITALY (AND THE UK) COULD BEST HELP </p><p>BY RAPIDLY CONCLUDING </p><p>AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH THE US, SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD SEE </p><p>THAT EVEN SUPPORTERS </p><p>OF THE ICC FIND NO CONTRADICTION IN SIGNING SUCH AN AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BUDGET WOES </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) FOR THE THIRD TIME, MARTINO LAMENTED THE EFFECT THE </p><p>JUST-SUBMITTED BUDGET </p><p>WOULD HAVE ON THE MINISTRY\'S PLANS.  ITALY WAS STILL SPENDING </p><p>JUST 1.05% OF ITS GDP </p><p>ON DEFENSE, ALTHOUGH THE GOI FULLY APPRECIATED THE NEED FOR </p><p>ITALY AND ALL OF EUROPE </p><p>TO SPEND MORE ON CAPABILITY-BUILDING.  THE GOVERNMENT HAD </p><p>MADE A COMMITMENT TO </p><p>IMPROVE THIS RATIO TO 1.5% BY 2006.  MARTINO HOPED THIS GOAL </p><p>WOULD BE ACHIEVED, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH THIS YEAR\'S BUDGET CONSTRAINTS MEANT NO PROGRESS </p><p>IN THAT DIRECTION. </p><p>HE QUOTED WHAT LORD ROBERTSON HAD SAID ABOUT ITALY\'S DEFENSE </p><p>CAPABILITIES IN A </p><p>RECENT MEETING WITH BERLUSCONI: "YOUR OUTPUT IS ADMIRABLE; </p><p>YOUR INPUT IS INADEQUATE." </p><p> </p><p>11.
