<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002813 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USCINCEUR FOR DCINC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 09/30/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PBTS, PREL, MOPS, MARR, PINS, IV, NI, UV </p><p>SUBJECT:  NIGERIA WANTS TIME TO IMPLEMENT BAKASSI </p><p>RULING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  A) ABUJA 2800, B) ABUJA 2787, </p><p>  C) USDAO ABUJA 2723, D) ABUJA 2721, </p><p>  E) USDEL SECRETARY 36, F) YAOUNDE 3401, </p><p>  G) STATE 196196 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  MFA convokes Ambassador, asserts GON </p><p>will eschew force in Bakassi, whatever the ICJ </p><p>decides, as long as Cameroon does the same.  However, </p><p>Abuja will want "time to study the verdict," a Joint </p><p>Implementation Committee and a second summit. </p><p>"Provocation" and "atrocities committed" by </p><p>Cameroonian gendarmes was Nigeria\'s justification for </p><p>putting military forces into Bakassi nearly a decade </p><p>ago, and other senior GON officials have sounded </p><p>harder lines.  Hence, the MFA demarche is not entirely </p><p>reassuring as a bellwether of events to come.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Acting on "instructions from a very high </p><p>level," MFA Permanent Secretary Dan Hart October 7 </p><p>convoked the Ambassador to "apprise [Nigeria\'s] </p><p>friends of our reaction" to the impending ICJ ruling </p><p>on the Cameroon/Nigeria border.  DCM accompanied the </p><p>Ambassador; Hart was alone.  Hart said the importance </p><p>of the GON message was such that it should normally </p><p>have been conveyed by a Minister, but both Sule Lamido </p><p>and Dubem Onyia were abroad, so it fell to him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Intimating that Abuja believed that the ICJ\'s </p><p>decision would go against Nigeria, Hart said Nigeria </p><p>would "ask for time to study the verdict." The GON </p><p>sought a "joint implementation committee" to manage </p><p>the post-decision process and might ask UNSYG Annan </p><p>"to convene another summit."  Nigeria would continue </p><p>with all confidence-building measures, ongoing and </p><p>planned, Hart assured. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ambassador Jeter replied that the USG looked </p><p>with favor on the revitalization of the Nigerian- </p><p>Cameroonian Bilateral Commission.  Hart confirmed that </p><p>the September 29-30 Ministerial meeting in Abuja had </p><p>gone well.  Hart explained that, contrary to some </p><p>media reports, Cameroonian President Paul Biya had </p><p>never been expected at the session.  The State Visit </p><p>to Nigeria discussed during the 5 September bilateral </p><p>Summit in Paris was envisaged for later in the year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Ambassador remarked that the Paris meeting </p><p>was a good start to a critical bilateral dialogue. </p><p>The U.S. knew of and appreciated Nigeria\'s previous </p><p>efforts to initiate bilateral negotiations, and we </p><p>commended the GOF and UNSYG for their facilitation of </p><p>discussions now underway.  We hoped for continued </p><p>(bilateral) progress toward a mutually-acceptable </p><p>outcome, regardless of the verdict. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Hart agreed that this process was "in the </p><p>African spirit of brotherhood" and averred that </p><p>Nigeria would continue to pursue it.  "It cannot be </p><p>otherwise," he continued.  "In view of the role we </p><p>play, we cannot be seen to be belligerent."  However, </p><p>he warned, if Cameroon were to prove belligerent, "we </p><p>are capable of standing up for ourselves." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Responding to a question from the Ambassador, </p><p>Hart opined that the French could have done more to </p><p>encourage bilateral dialogue.  The economic </p><p>relationship between France and Nigeria should have </p><p>made France "more positively assertive earlier."  But </p><p>Hart acknowledged the accuracy of French claims that </p><p>Biya was reclusive and often obdurate and commented </p><p>that a good personal relationship between Presidents </p><p>Chirac and Obasanjo had helped. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT: The case before the ICJ covers the </p><p>border from Lake Chad to the Gulf of Guinea.  However, </p><p>control of Bakassi and the adjacent waters lies at the </p><p>heart of the dispute.  Hart\'s demarche suggests that </p><p>the GON intends to delay functional implementation of </p><p>an ICJ decision that goes against Nigeria on the core </p><p>Bakassi issue as long as it possibly can.  Given the </p><p>stresses and constraints the ongoing electoral season </p><p>imposes, the GON stance should be understood in </p><p>Yaounde as about the most forthcoming Nigeria can be </p><p>at this time.  Others in the GON, including the </p><p>influential Minister of Defense (REF A) and his senior </p><p>deputy (REF B) have taken much harder lines.  As we </p><p>have reported previously, it is an article of faith </p><p>among most Nigerians, including their elected </p><p>representatives (REF B) that Bakassi is part of </p><p>Nigeria.  No government facing a near-term election, </p><p>especially one as embattled as Obasanjo\'s, can afford </p><p>to concede the correctness of an ICJ decision that </p><p>goes against Nigeria.  Given the ever-present danger </p><p>of a military skirmish or an incident between GOC </p><p>forces and Nigerian civilians escalating into </p><p>something worse -- a danger that will be heightened by </p><p>the decision, no matter its beneficiary -- the </p><p>importance of restraint and bilateral negotiations </p><p>(REF G) probably can never be repeated too often. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C-Rel NATO) DATT COMMENT:  Recent DAO Yaounde and </p><p>Abuja reporting contradicts Hart\'s assertion of a GOC </p><p>build-up of forces in the Bakassi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
