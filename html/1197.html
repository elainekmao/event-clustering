<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001420 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, INR/EAP/SEA, EB/TDC </p><p>SECDEF FOR ISA/EA/LSTERN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, VM, SR </p><p>SUBJECT: VISIT OF FRY FM JOVANOVICH TO HANOI:  MORE SYMBOLISM THAN SUBSTANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  99 HANOI 1241 </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY:  FRY FOREIGN MINISTER JOVANOVIC\'S JUNE 4-8 </p><p>VISIT TO VIETNAM FOCUSED ON LITTLE OF REAL SUBSTANCE.  THE </p><p>EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC "INFORMATION-SHARING" PROMISES LITTLE </p><p>FOR TRULY STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC RELATIONS.  HANOI\'S </p><p>COVERAGE OF THE VISIT WAS MEASURED AND REHASHED CRITICAL </p><p>RHETORIC FROM LAST YEAR\'S NATO KOSOVO INTERVENTION.  THE </p><p>VISIT WAS HEAVIER ON SYMBOLISM THAN SUBSTANCE.  THE SERBIANS </p><p>NO DOUBT FIND VIETNAM A RARE COUNTRY WHERE THE WELCOME MAT </p><p>IS OUT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   FRY FOREIGN MINISTER ZIVADIN JOVANOVIC VISITED VIETNAM </p><p>JUNE 4-8.  IT WAS THE SECOND VISIT BY A HIGH-LEVEL SERBIAN </p><p>OFFICAL IN FOURTEEN MONTHS (WHEN DEPUTY FM NOVAKOVICH PAID A </p><p>VISIT JUST AS NATO BEGAN ITS KOSOVO INTERVENTION).  HIS </p><p>DELEGATION VISITED HANOI AND THE NORTHERN SEASIDE RESORT OF </p><p>HA LONG BAY.  IN HANOI, JOVANOVIC MET WITH CPV POLITBURO </p><p>STANDING BOARD MEMBER PHAM THE DUYET, PRESIDENT TRAN DUC </p><p>LUONG, MINISTER OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT TRAN XUAN GIA, </p><p>MINISTER OF CONSTRUCTION NGUYEN MANH KIEM, VICE TRADE </p><p>MINISTER MAI VAN DAU, AND VIETNAM CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND </p><p>INDUSTRY CHAIRMAN DOAN DUY THANH, AS WELL AS HIS </p><p>COUNTERPART, FM NGUYEN DY NIEN.  JOVANOVIC CAME WITH A LARGE </p><p>BUSINESS ENTOURAGE WHICH HELD AN "INFORMATION-SHARING" </p><p>SEMINAR WITH RELATED VIETNAMESE COMPANIES.  THE VISIT </p><p>PRODUCED AN AGREEMENT ON VISA EXEMPTIONS FOR DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>OFFICIAL PASSPORT-HOLDERS, AND A PROTOCOL ON COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN THE TWO FOREIGN MINISTRIES.  NIEN AND LUONG ACCEPTED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01420  01 OF 02  300224Z </p><p>INVITATIONS FOR VISITS FROM JOVANOVIC AND MILOSEVIC. </p><p> </p><p>3.   PRESS ACCOUNTS ON BOTH SIDES CONTAINED PREDICTABLE </p><p>EXPRESSIONS OF FRATERNAL SOLIDARITY AND TRADITIONAL </p><p>FRIENDSHIP.  SPARSE AND RELATIVELY LACKLUSTER VIETNAMESE </p><p>COVERAGE INCLUDED DE RIGEUR LANGUAGE CONDEMNING NATO </p><p>INTERVENTION IN KOSOVO IN 1999, AND SUPPORTING THE FRY\'S </p><p>FULL RE-INTEGRATION INTO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THERE </p><p>WAS LITTLE TO NO DETAIL ON JOVANOVIC\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH </p><p>NIEN, OTHER THAN NOTING THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES DISCUSSED </p><p>BILATERAL AND INTERNATIONAL ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN AND </p><p>AGREED ON UNSPECIFIED MEASURES TO BOOST TIES.  FRY (BUT NOT </p><p>VIETNAMESE) ACCOUNTS NOTED THAT THESE TALKS WERE "HIGHLY </p><p>CORDIAL, WARM, AND FRIENDLY."  FRY MEDIA WERE ALSO FORWARD- </p><p>LEANING ON BILATERAL ECONOMIC POTENTIAL, OF WHICH MORE MUTED </p><p>MENTION WAS MADE IN THE VIETNAMESE PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>4.   ON JUNE 22, AFTER PERSISTENT REQUESTS, POLOFF MET WITH </p><p>MFA EUROPE 1 DEPARTMENT DEPUTY DIRECTOR TRAN HUU TUNG FOR A </p><p>READ-OUT OF THE VISIT.  TUNG STRESSED THAT THE VISIT WAS </p><p>WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF NORMAL EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR "OLD TRADITIONAL </p><p>FRIENDSHIP," AND WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH VIETNAM\'S POLICY OF </p><p>MULTILATERALIZATION OF ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.   TUNG SAID THE MAJOR FOCUS OF THE VISIT WAS EXPLORING </p><p>OPTIONS FOR INCREASING BILATERAL ECONOMIC TIES, WHICH </p><p>"SUFFERED DURING THE 1990S."   JOVANOVIC WAS ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>A BUSINESS GROUP REPRESENTING NINE LARGE FRY CORPORATIONS </p><p>SPECIALIZING IN FIELDS SUCH AS ELECTRONICS, MACHINERY, </p><p>CONSTRUCTION, OIL, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, FOOD PROCESSING, AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01420  01 OF 02  300224Z </p><p>TOBACCO MANUFACTURING.  THIS GROUP MET WITH VIETNAMESE </p><p>BUSINESSPEOPLE AND ATTENDED A BUSINESS CONFERENCE, THE </p><p>PURPOSE OF WHICH WAS TO LEARN ABOUT POTENTIAL FOR BILATERAL </p><p>COOPERATION IN VARIOUS FIELDS.  TUNG COMMENTED THAT PAST </p><p>INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL PARTNERS HAS BEEN VERY LIMITED, AND </p><p>THIS VISIT PRESENTED A VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY IN THAT IT WAS </p><p>THE FIRST CHANCE FOR MANY OF THE FRY COMPANIES TO GET TO </p><p>KNOW THEIR VIETNAMESE COUNTERPARTS.  ASKED TO COMMENT ON </p><p>JOVANOVIC\'S REMARK AT A HANOI PRESS BRIEFING THAT THE TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES HAD EXPLORED CONCRETE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TECHNOLOGY </p><p>TRANSFERS, HOWEVER, TUNG SQUIRMED BUT DID NOT OFFER ANY </p><p>DETAIL, SAYING THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE JUST AT THE </p><p>INFORMATION-EXCHANGING STAGE.  BUSINESSES FROM THE TWO SIDES </p><p>NEED MORE CONTACTS TO LEARN ABOUT EACH OTHER\'S CAPABILITIES, </p><p>AND TO WORK OUT SPECIFIC DETAILS OF ANY VENTURES.  (COMMENT: </p><p>TUNG CLEARLY APPEARED TO BE BACK-PEDALLING FROM JOVANIC\'S </p><p>STATEMENT.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  POLOFF ASKED TUNG FOR HIS VIEWS ON THE PROSPECTS FOR </p><p>BOOSTING OVERALL ECONOMIC TIES; TUNG REPLIED ONLY THAT </p><p>VIETNAM WISHES TO NORMALIZE ITS ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH ALL </p><p>COUNTRIES, INCLUDING YUGOSLAVIA.  HE DID COMMENT THAT </p><p>"EFFECTIVENESS," MEANING COMPATIBILITY, IS THE KEY IN ALL </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS.  COOPERATION IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF IT </p><p>MEETS THE WISHES AND INTERESTS OF BOTH SIDES.  VIETNAM\'S </p><p>WISH, OF COURSE, IS TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC TIES, BUT MANY </p><p>FACTORS HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, AND THE OUTCOME OF </p><p>BILATERAL EFFORTS REMAINS TO BE SEEN. </p><p> </p><p>7.   TURNING TO OTHER AREAS OF THE VISIT, TUNG SAID THAT </p><p>VIETNAM AND YUGOSLAVIA HAD CONSULTATIONS ON "BILATERAL </p><p>ISSUES AND TOPICS OF MUTUAL INTEREST," BUT DECLINED TO GO </p><p>INTO DETAIL.  HE SAID THAT THE MFA COOPERATION PROTOCOL </p><p>RESEMBLED THOSE REACHED WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, PROVIDING FOR </p><p>NORMAL ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS VISITS AND DIALOGUES, WHICH </p><p>VIETNAM CARRIES OUT WITH MANY NATIONS.  ASKED ABOUT </p><p>JOVANOVIC\'S ACTIVITIES IN QUANG NINH, TUNG SAID IT WAS </p><p>SIMPLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FOREIGN MINISTER, AS A FRIEND </p><p>FROM AFAR, TO SEE SOME OF VIETNAM\'S SCENIC BEAUTY.  (NOTE: </p><p>FRY PRESS ACCOUNTS STATED JOVANOVIC ALSO HAD A MEETING WITH </p><p>QUANG NINH PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE DEPUTY CHAIR NGUYEN </p><p>VAN MIEN.) </p><p> </p><p>8.   COMMENT:  AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE </p><p>SUBSTANTIVE PROGRESS IN VIETNAM-FRY RELATIONS SINCE DEP FM </p><p>NOVAKOVICH\'S VISIT TO HANOI IN MARCH 1999 (REFTEL).  MFA </p><p>OFFICIAL TUNG WAS GUARDED AND VAGUE IN HIS REMARKS AND HAD </p><p>LITTLE DETAIL TO OFFER ON THE VISIT.  HE SEEMED AT SOME </p><p>PAINS TO EMPHASIZE THE ROUTINE AND NON-NOTEWORTHY NATURE OF </p><p>THE VISIT AND ITS CONTENTS.  ALTHOUGH THE STATED FOCUS WAS </p><p>ON DEVELOPING ECONOMIC TIES, TUNG WAS ABLE TO OFFER LITTLE </p><p>OF A CONCRETE NATURE ON ACTUAL PROSPECTS OR MUTUAL BENEFIT. </p><p>THIS, ALONG WITH SPARSE COVERAGE IN VIETNAM\'S STATE- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01420  02 OF 02  300224Z </p><p>CONTROLLED MEDIA, UNDERSCORES HOW LITTLE EACH COUNTRY HAS TO </p><p>OFFER THE OTHER IN REAL ECONOMIC TERMS. </p><p> </p><p>9.  COMMENT CONT\'D:  A WESTERN DIPLOMAT WHO WATCHES FRY </p><p>ACTIVITIES HERE REMARKED THAT VIETNAM AND YUGOSLAVIA APPEAR </p><p>TO HAVE FEW CONCRETE MUTUAL INTERESTS OTHER THAN A STAUNCH </p><p>OPPOSITION TO THE NATO INTERVENTION IN KOSOVO.  SEEN IN THIS </p><p>LIGHT, THE VISIT WAS HEAVIER ON SYMBOLISM THAN SUBSTANCE. </p><p>IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER "INFORMATION-SHARING" ON TRADE </p><p>AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WILL LEAD TO REAL FORWARD </p><p>MOVEMENT ON BILATERAL ECONOMIC TIES.  THE FRY EVIDENTLY </p><p>FINDS IN VIETNAM A RARE COUNTRY WHERE THE WELCOME MAT IS OUT </p><p>FOR ITS OFFICIALS.  END COMMENT. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
