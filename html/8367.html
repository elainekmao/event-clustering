<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003172 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: KING ABDULLAH\'S MAY 26 NATIONAL DAY ADDRESS </p><p>FOCUSES ON UPCOMING ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS GMP20030525000102 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) King Abdullah devoted most of his May 26 National </p><p>Day address to preparations for the upcoming Parliamentary </p><p>elections scheduled for June 17, only giving "hot button" </p><p>regional issues such as Palestine and Iraq scant mention at </p><p>the conclusion of his remarks. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>Political Development -- the Message from on High </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The bulk of the King\'s May 26 address to the nation </p><p>focused on the theme of "political development" and the </p><p>responsibilities of all Jordanians to ensure that the </p><p>upcoming June 17 Parliamentary elections "promote our </p><p>democratic march."  The King stated "the time has come to </p><p>intensify our efforts in order to accelerate the political </p><p>development process, reinvigorate the role of political </p><p>parties, and continue to preserve public freedoms . . . </p><p>alongside economic and social development." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Turning more directly to the upcoming campaign, the </p><p>King called on "every brother and sister in this nation, to </p><p>perform their duties, and to practice their rights in </p><p>participating in these elections."  He then listed a set of </p><p>personal characteristics that voters should look for in </p><p>making their selection: "The capable representative  . . . </p><p>should be in possession of a certain measure of science, </p><p>knowledge and awareness, and integrity and genuine belonging </p><p>to this nation, one who places national interests above all </p><p>others, whether personal, partisan or factional.  I have full </p><p>confidence in your perception that is never fooled by </p><p>glittering mottos, ideologies or ideas that have been </p><p>outdated and proven failures." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Only Passing Mention of Palestine and Iraq </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Only at the conclusion of his remarks did the King </p><p>make direct reference to regional issues, noting that "Jordan </p><p>has been and will remain, Allah willing, devoted to its Arab </p><p>nation . . . in the forefront of which is the Palestinian </p><p>cause.  Based on this we will continue to support our </p><p>Palestinian brethren in their stance regarding the "roadmap," </p><p>that shall lead to the establishment of their independent </p><p>Palestinian state, on Palestinian soil.  As for Iraq, we will </p><p>do our utmost to ensure its territorial integrity . . . </p><p>sovereignty over their lands, their right to choose their own </p><p>independent leadership and future." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) A sampling of Embassy contacts noted that the most </p><p>notable aspect of the King\'s address was his almost complete </p><p>focus on political development, compared to previous messages </p><p>which centered more on economic and social issues.  Virtually </p><p>all welcomed the King\'s emphasis on encouraging political </p><p>participation and democratization.  That said, however, many </p><p>also commented that few Jordanians paid much attention to </p><p>this address.  Instead, the talk in coffee shops and around </p><p>dinner tables this week was not of abstract notions of </p><p>political development, but rather about news of a more </p><p>concrete nature: that the government intends to raise prices </p><p>on many staple goods in the days ahead. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
