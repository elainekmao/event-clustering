<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002982 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF, AF/W, AF/RA AND AF/E </p><p>DEPT ALSO PASS TO SPECIAL ENVOY DANFORTH </p><p>LONDON, PARIS, ROME, OSLO FOR AFRICA WATCHERS </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p>NSC FOR FRAZER AND MILLER </p><p>DIA FOR J.GERHARD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/26/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, CG, SU, BY, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NSA MOHAMMED DISCUSSES SUDAN, DROC, </p><p>BURUNDI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Jeter, accompanied by PolCouns and </p><p>PolMilOff, called on NSA Aliyu Mohammed on November 11. The </p><p>President\'s Special Coordinator for Sudan, Dr. Usman Bugaje </p><p>also attended.  This message covers their conversation on </p><p>Nigeria\'s foreign affairs efforts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY CONTINUED: Stymied on recent Sudan and DROC </p><p>efforts, NSA Mohammed and Bugaje described Nigeria\'s efforts </p><p>thus far, but without much sense of next steps.  The Sudan </p><p>conference is postponed, and Nigeria is looking to Senator </p><p>Danforth\'s trip for direction.  The key players on the DROC, </p><p>Kabila, Bemba and Osunumba, have agreed to another try for an </p><p>Abuja meeting, but no date has yet been set.  The NSA agreed </p><p>to pass a matrix outlining anti-terrorism treaty ratification </p><p>status to the President for review.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=============== </p><p>SUDAN POSTPONED </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Special Sudan Coordinator, Dr. Usman Bugaje, described </p><p>Nigerian efforts on Sudan.  Bugaje emphasized that Nigeria\'s </p><p>only goal in holding the now postponed conference was to </p><p>provide a venue for consensus-building; it was never intended </p><p>as a negotiating forum.  In the GON\'s view, the event was not </p><p>important, only the outcome.  Bugaje said that he believed </p><p>the GOS thought the process was moving too quickly; </p><p>therefore, it was better to postpone.  Asked about SPLM views </p><p>on the conference, Bugaje said that the SPLM had been "keen </p><p>to attend," and the NDA had even sought extra invitations, </p><p>but there were some (not further identified) who did not want </p><p>a resolution of the conflict, because "peace would cost them </p><p>their positions." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Ambassador Jeter noted that, in response to President </p><p>Obasanjo\'s request, the USG had explained to Egypt that </p><p>Nigeria was not trying to hijack the Sudan peace process, and </p><p>wondered what Egypt\'s concerns might have been.  Bugaje said </p><p>he thought that the Egyptians were afraid of any effort that </p><p>they could not control because they feared that such an </p><p>effort could lead to a divided Sudan.  President Obasanjo had </p><p>written to Mubarak to explain that Nigeria would never seek </p><p>division of Sudan; on the contrary, Nigeria supported greater </p><p>integration on the Continent, not fragmentation of existing </p><p>states.  In any case, Bugaje said that Nigeria looks forward </p><p>to hearing about Senator Danforth\'s upcoming trip, which </p><p>should inform the GON on the next steps it might take. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>================ </p><p>WHITHER BURUNDI? </p><p>================ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Complimenting the NSA on President Obasanjo\'s support </p><p>for peace in Burundi, the Ambassador asked about Nigeria\'s </p><p>next steps.  The NSA said Nigeria would send a battalion to </p><p>support the effort, but he was not sure when or where the </p><p>funding would come from.  He was also unsure who might </p><p>replace Mandela. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======================= </p><p>DROC - ANOTHER MEETING? </p><p>======================= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Agreeing that the Congolese National Dialogue meetings </p><p>in Addis were not successful, the NSA said he believed many </p><p>of the Addis participants would not attend the meeting in </p><p>South Africa.  Nigeria had tried to help with the disarmament </p><p>process by asking President Kabila to contain his Minister of </p><p>Security, but Kabila was a blood nephew of the Minister and </p><p>was not willing or able to challenge his senior uncle. </p><p>Nigeria was trying to schedule another meeting in Abuja with </p><p>Kabila, Bemba and Osunumba, but had not yet set a date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>========================== </p><p>ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTIONS </p><p>========================== </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Ambassador Jeter passed the NSA a matrix on the status </p><p>of signature and ratification of anti-terrorism conventions </p><p>of West African states, and requested that Nigeria work </p><p>toward signature and ratification of the treaties.  The NSA, </p><p>looking over the document (which makes for easy comparison </p><p>among ECOWAS states), said the matrix made it apparent that </p><p>Nigeria was not doing too well, and said he would pass the </p><p>paper to the President for review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: Most of Nigeria\'s recent conflict resolution </p><p>efforts have been stymied by unwilling participants. </p><p>Nevertheless, Nigeria will continue to engage on the </p><p>Continent.  Regional and indeed Continental stability remains </p><p>the watchword of Nigeria\'s foreign policy.  END COMMENT. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
