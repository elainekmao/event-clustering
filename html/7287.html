<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000658 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 DECL: 03/30/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ELECTION COMMISSION CHAIRMAN SAYS </p><p>EVERYTHING\'S ON SCHEDULE </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter, reason 1.5 (b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: During a March 12 meeting, Independent </p><p>National Election Commission (INEC) Chairman Abel Guobadia </p><p>told Ambassador Jeter that INEC preparations were on </p><p>schedule; INEC would be ready to conduct elections in April </p><p>and a postponement was not contemplated. To demonstrate </p><p>INEC\'s readiness, Guobadia said INEC had finalized 90% of </p><p>the voters list and was ahead of schedule on ordering </p><p>ballot boxes and ballot papers. However, he claimed INEC </p><p>needed an additional appropriation of 12 billion Naira (USG </p><p>approximately 920 million) for election day expenses </p><p>(travel expenses, workers stipends, etc.) Guobadia\'s </p><p>picture of readiness contrasted with one painted by </p><p>opposition political parties. They claim INEC is bumbling </p><p>and highly partisan; they also say the electoral fix is on. </p><p>The truth may lie somewhere between.  INEC has exerted </p><p>itself more than the suspicious opposition parties will </p><p>acknowledge; however, its performance in many areas, </p><p>especially voter registration, has been substandard.  Much </p><p>of the criticism of INEC continues to be legitimate even at </p><p>this late stage. Despite Guobadia\'s assurances, INEC has </p><p>must make a gigantic, late hour push before it is ready. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a March 12 meeting with INEC Chairman </p><p>Guobadia, Ambassador underscored the importance of </p><p>successful elections. Nigeria would take a momentous step </p><p>in the right direction by holding its first successful </p><p>elections under civilian government. INEC would have won </p><p>itself an enviable place when the history of this period is </p><p>written, the Ambassador stressed. The entire world is </p><p>watching and hoping.  He added that Nigeria likewise owed a </p><p>special duty to the sub-region, a region where its </p><p>leadership was preeminent and much needed.  Noting that </p><p>West Africa had become an increasingly troubled </p><p>neighborhood, Jeter emphasized that credible elections </p><p>could be a democratic fillip to Nigeria\'s neighbors. </p><p>Conversely, poor elections could dash the hopes of </p><p>democracy elsewhere in the region, and further afield on </p><p>the continent.  Failed elections would inevitably spark </p><p>greater unrest and violence at home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ambassador Jeter informed Guobadia that he had </p><p>hosted a March 11 meeting with political party leaders. </p><p>All the parties in attendance uniformly criticized INEC\'s </p><p>election management.  He suggested that INEC might consider </p><p>calling a special meeting of political party chairmen along </p><p>with the police, State Security Services (SSS) and the </p><p>Police Service Commission (PSC) to discuss the parties\' </p><p>concerns about electoral preparations and security.  Jeter </p><p>added that such a meeting could address numerous doubts and </p><p>misgivings the parties had about INEC.  Moreover, the </p><p>parties seemed keenly interested in such a meeting, the </p><p>Ambassador said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Chairman Guobadia responded that INEC stood ready to </p><p>meet the parties. In fact, he had hosted such a meeting </p><p>earlier that day but only 12 of the 30 parties attended. </p><p>At the previous regular meeting with the parties a few </p><p>weeks before, only four parties showed, the Chairman </p><p>asserted. (Comment: Guobadia\'s description of party </p><p>attendance was accurate.  After his meeting with Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, Guobadia met party leaders on March 17 to discuss </p><p>the anti-violence Code of Conduct. At the March 17 </p><p>unveiling of the Code, only nine parties attended the </p><p>session and signed the instrument. The ruling PDP and ANPP, </p><p>the two largest parties, failed to attend. During the March </p><p>19 special elections stakeholders meeting called by the </p><p>President, the remaining parties vowed their assent and all </p><p>but four have signed. Unfortunately, the PDP and ANPP have </p><p>yet to sign due to a feud over which one should go first. </p><p>End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Guobadia continued that INEC regularly conferred </p><p>with the Police, PSC and SSS regarding election day </p><p>security, particularly for INEC personnel and sensitive </p><p>election material such as ballots, ballot boxes and vote </p><p>tabulation sheets. He explained that the National Police </p><p>force had only 90,000 active officers, meaning a deployment </p><p>of less than one officer for each of the 120,000 polling </p><p>stations nationwide. To address the obvious gap, help would </p><p>be needed from the SSS and other security related agencies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Voter\'s Registration - Is The Cup Half Full Or Half Empty? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) On the all important issue of voter registration, </p><p>The Chairman claimed INEC was 90% finished with finalizing </p><p>the voters rolls. He claimed that most states had begun to </p><p>display the list. He added that 10% of the total voter </p><p>applications were discarded for being fraudulent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment: Guobadia\'s portrayal of voter\'s </p><p>registration was inaccurate almost to the point of </p><p>dissimulation. According to our best evidence, lists were </p><p>displayed in only a few states and only a few areas in </p><p>those states. INEC has yet to finalize and display the </p><p>voters list in every state. INEC announced subsequent to </p><p>this meeting with the Ambassador that the lists would be </p><p>displayed and voters cards made available the second week </p><p>in April, just a few days before the April 12 National </p><p>Assembly elections. This probably will not provide </p><p>sufficient time for the statutorily required period for the </p><p>public to raise objections to the list. Moreover, INEC had </p><p>announced in early March that the claims period was March </p><p>11-12, although the lists were not ready for the vast </p><p>majority of voters to review. The litany of grievances with </p><p>the registration process has caused the political parties </p><p>and much of the public to believe that INEC has already </p><p>significantly undermined the election and to suspect that </p><p>INEC will not be prepared to handle election logistics. End </p><p>Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Guobadia acknowledged that INEC\'s late release of </p><p>the voters rolls had not gone unchallenged.  The National </p><p>Democratic Party (NPD) had filed suit claiming INEC had </p><p>abrogated the electoral law by not publicizing the voters </p><p>lists at least 60 days before the April elections </p><p>commenced.  In a legal interpretation not previously heard </p><p>from INEC, the Chairman contended the law simply required </p><p>INEC to have concluded the actual process of receiving </p><p>registration applications from the voters 60 days prior to </p><p>the election.  INEC\'s contention was that the 60-day </p><p>requirement did not refer to displaying the voters roll. </p><p>(Comment: This interpretation is novel and expectant. </p><p>Simply put, INEC has not published the rolls. It needs to </p><p>defend itself from charges of flouting the law.  This new, </p><p>facile interpretation will further diminish INEC </p><p>credibility; INEC\'s original timetable had scheduled the </p><p>publication of the voters roll prior to February in </p><p>observance of the 60 day requirement.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>The Ballots Are Coming, The Ballots Are Coming! </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) On the positive side, Guobadia announced that the </p><p>delivery of ballot paper and ballot boxes was on schedule, </p><p>in fact, he claimed that vendor had wanted to send ballots </p><p>and boxes ahead of time.  Containers of ballot paper had </p><p>already been delivered but Guobadia had to inform his </p><p>suppliers in Canada, United Kingdom and Germany to halt </p><p>delivery as INEC lacked sufficient warehouse space. </p><p>Guobadia did not want the headache of procuring additional </p><p>storage space and he feared tampering if too many ballots </p><p>were in Nigeria too early.  Guobadia remarked that the </p><p>ballot papers would be significantly bulkier than the 1999 </p><p>version -- due to the increased number of parties this </p><p>time.  Consequently, new boxes, manufactured in China, with </p><p>larger openings would replace the ones used in 1999. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>I Need Money For Election Day </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) While stating that funding had been sufficient to </p><p>meet pre-election day needs, Guobadia warned INEC required </p><p>another 12 billion Naira for election day expenses, four </p><p>billion for each of the three contests.  (April 12 - </p><p>National Assembly, April 19 - Presidential and </p><p>gubernatorial, April 26 - possible run-off.) Major election </p><p>day expenses Guobadia mentioned were stipends and </p><p>transportation costs for several hundred thousand poll </p><p>workers, transport of material to and from polling stations </p><p>and logistical support at vote tabulation centers. </p><p>Guobadia expressed concern whether INEC would have </p><p>sufficiently qualified administrators to manage vote </p><p>tabulation centers properly.  These collation centers were </p><p>where the real problems would arise.  "Here is where a vote </p><p>of 1,000 can become 10,000," he contended.  Because of the </p><p>need for non-partisan, qualified managers at these sites, </p><p>INEC has resorted to a special call to the private sector </p><p>and retired senior civil servants to staff these crucial </p><p>positions on election day. (Note: Newspapers report that </p><p>INEC has received over 9 billion Naira from FY 03 </p><p>appropriations to help meet these expenses.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Monitors </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Guobadia stated the Foreign Ministry not INEC </p><p>would vet the names of the foreign monitors.  INEC\'s role </p><p>was limited to providing badges once the MFA had approved </p><p>the names. Regarding domestic monitors, INEC had the </p><p>primary responsibility to vet and clear these individuals. </p><p>INEC\'s main concern, in vetting the monitors, was that they </p><p>be non-partisan.  He added that domestic monitors would not </p><p>have to register at INEC\'s national headquarters but could </p><p>obtain accreditation at the various state headquarters. </p><p>(Comment:  Visiting Carter Center representatives expressed </p><p>fears about INEC\'s capacity to register and accredit the </p><p>expected 20,000-30,000 monitors.  Ambassador arranged a </p><p>meeting for them with Guobadia where they proposed that </p><p>INEC simply register the organizations and provide them </p><p>with numbered badges corresponding to the number of </p><p>observers each organization planned to field.  Guobadia </p><p>claimed he liked the idea, but we are uncertain if it was </p><p>implemented.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Guobadia put his best foot forward but the road is </p><p>long and the destination cannot be reached with only one or </p><p>two steps.  INEC is scrambling to be minimally ready for </p><p>the April 12 National Assembly election.  The National </p><p>Assembly contests, in and of themselves, have not elicited </p><p>much public interest; however, most people are interested </p><p>or at least curious not because of the contests themselves </p><p>but because the April 12 elections may provide INEC a dry- </p><p>run for the big test -- the Presidential and Gubernatorial </p><p>elections on April 19.   Thus, the quality of the National </p><p>Assembly will greatly influence perceptions going into the </p><p>Presidential contest. At this late date, INEC can do little </p><p>to improve voter registration.  However, INEC may be </p><p>forgiven many of its pre-election lapses if it is seen as </p><p>conducting the balloting and the vote tabulation as a </p><p>competent neutral agent.  This achievement is still within </p><p>INEC\'s reach but only if the Commission exerts itself </p><p>mightily during the last waning days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
