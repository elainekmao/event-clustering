<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 003309 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR STATE AF/PD, AF/W, PA </p><p>LAGOS FOR PAS, POL/ECON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, SOCI, AF </p><p>SUBJECT:  AFGHANISTAN RECONSTRUCTION AND THE NIGERIAN </p><p>PRESS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reftel:  STATE 251043 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Interest in Afghanistan and USG actions </p><p>in rebuilding the country is low among Nigeria\'s </p><p>southern journalists.  There is more interest in the </p><p>print media in Nigeria\'s mostly Muslim north, which </p><p>occasionally publishes Afghan-related material, mostly </p><p>in the context of stories on Iraq, which remains the </p><p>lead international story.  Radio newscasts of </p><p>continuing developments in Afghanistan are more </p><p>frequent, and have a much wider audience in Nigeria </p><p>than television or print journalism.  Common </p><p>misperceptions regarding Afghanistan center on Afghan </p><p>President Karzai as a U.S. puppet leader with no </p><p>popular support, as well as accusations of massive </p><p>Afghan casualties suffered during the removal of the </p><p>Taliban government.  Public affairs strategies to </p><p>improve Nigerian understanding of Afghanistan should </p><p>focus less on the USG and more on </p><p>commentaries/statements by UN officials, key Muslim </p><p>figures in Afghanistan, and regional leaders from </p><p>Islamic countries who support Karzai and continued USG </p><p>actions in Afghanistan.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Afghanistan Not a Media Priority in Nigeria </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Afghanistan is no longer a story that generates </p><p>much media attention in southern Nigeria, where </p><p>average Nigerians are far more focused on the upcoming </p><p>national elections, the continuing debate over the </p><p>riots surrounding the Miss World contest, and pressing </p><p>domestic economic and political issues.  In Nigeria\'s </p><p>mostly Muslim north, news regarding Afghanistan is </p><p>more common, although it largely consists of straight </p><p>news stories and statements by USG officials carried </p><p>on VOA and BBC.  Northern print journalists often </p><p>include references to Afghanistan within the context </p><p>of articles on Iraq, which remains the lead </p><p>international news story in the north and the south. </p><p>Public opinion among Muslims regarding the U.S. role </p><p>in Afghanistan tends to be negative and simplistic, </p><p>with the U.S. regarded as having imposed its will on </p><p>the country as part of its global war against </p><p>terrorism and Islam.  Afghan leader Hamid Karzai is </p><p>generally viewed as a puppet leader installed by U.S. </p><p>military force, and someone who lacks popular support </p><p>among the Afghan people.  Coverage on Afghanistan also </p><p>centers on the U.S. military role rather than on </p><p>reconstruction efforts.  Stories in the print media </p><p>continue to assert that Afghanistan suffered large </p><p>numbers of civilian casualties during the U.S. </p><p>military campaign against the Taliban.  A December 9 </p><p>story in the northern-based independent newspaper, </p><p>"Daily Trust," said that "the war, just like the </p><p>(terrorist) attack on the U.S., left thousands of so- </p><p>called terrorists and civilians dead, killed by "un- </p><p>smart" bombs in these days of "smart bombs." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  A USG public affairs strategy for Nigeria should </p><p>focus less on USG officials speaking on Afghanistan </p><p>and more on statements from UN officials, Afghans, and </p><p>Muslim leaders from the Middle East and South Asia. </p><p>While the U.S. is playing a positive role, focusing on </p><p>USG leadership in the reconstruction effort will </p><p>unfortunately reinforce negative perceptions of </p><p>unwanted USG domination of the Afghan people.  The USG </p><p>should emphasize the strong UN role in Afghanistan as </p><p>well as Afghan ownership of the Bonn process and </p><p>reconstruction strategy.  The USG role should be </p><p>viewed as supportive of the international community\'s </p><p>strategy for Afghanistan.  That said, we should </p><p>continue to make certain that the Nigerian public is </p><p>aware of international humanitarian contributions to </p><p>Afghanistan and America\'s leading role in prodding the </p><p>international community to do more.  We also need to </p><p>continue pressing the theme of how bad life was for </p><p>average Afghans under the Taliban and how hope for an </p><p>improved future exists today due to the Taliban\'s </p><p>ouster. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Public affairs strategies that would enhance the </p><p>Nigerian Muslim public\'s knowledge of the USG </p><p>commitment to Afghanistan could include Hausa language </p><p>radio interviews with Afghan religious leaders who </p><p>support Karzai and the USG, as well as interviews with </p><p>Kofi Annan and the UN Secretary General\'s Special </p><p>Representative Lakhdar Brahimi on the Bonn process, UN </p><p>activities in Afghanistan, and the continuing need for </p><p>USG support for Afghanistan.  Messages regarding </p><p>Iranian government support and that by other Islamic </p><p>leaders for Karzai would also be useful in countering </p><p>Karzai\'s image as a President whose appeal does not </p><p>extend beyond the United States.  The U.S. mission to </p><p>Nigeria publishes a Hausa-language magazine ("Magama") </p><p>that targets Hausa-speaking elites; excerpts or </p><p>digests of radio programming could be included in </p><p>upcoming issues.  Finally, we would suggest a press </p><p>tour in Afghanistan for a small group of African </p><p>journalists (preferably Muslims or those from Sub- </p><p>Saharan countries with large Muslim populations), </p><p>which would provide a first-hand opportunity to speak </p><p>with Afghans and international community officials on </p><p>how far Afghanistan has progressed in the post-Taliban </p><p>period. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
