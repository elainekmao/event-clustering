LOOKING AHEAD, THE TEAM WILL NOW FINALIZE </p><p>AND CIRCULATE THEIR REPORT IN WASHINGTON, THE GOZ </p><p>ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP WILL MEET WITH TOP FUND </p><p>MANAGEMENT IN PRAGUE, AND IN LATE NOVEMBER/EARLY </p><p>DECEMBER A FORMAL ACTION RECOMMENDATION WILL BE PUT </p><p>FORTH TO THE BOARD.

(C) THE IMF TEAM LEADER, PABLO NEUHAUS, PRESENTED </p><p>A CONCISE AND FAST-MOVING SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT </p><p>ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OUTLOOK.  THE HIGHLIGHTS ARE: </p><p>YEAR-END INFLATION PREDICTED AT ABOUT 80 PERCENT; THE </p><p>2000 GOVERNMENT DEFICIT ESTIMATED TO BE AT LEAST 23 </p><p>PERCENT OF GDP BASED ON THEIR AUDITS AND THE RECENTLY </p><p>RELASED SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET (LARGELY DUE TO INCREASES </p><p>IN WAGES, INTEREST AND DEFENSE SPENDING); AND AN </p><p>ESTIMATED 5 1/2 PERCENT REAL GDP SHRINKAGE THIS YEAR </p><p>WITH AT LEAST A 6 1/2 PERCENT DECLINE EXPECTED NEXT </p><p>YEAR.

"AT LEAST THEY ARE NO </p><p>LONGER IN DENIAL," SAID NEUHAUS, "AS THEIR </p><p>PREDECESSORS WERE."  WHETHER THEY WILL HAVE THE </p><p>LEEWAY TO BE MORE CONSISTENT AND RATIONAL "REMAINS TO </p><p>BE SEEN," HE SAID, AND THEIR ACTIONS OVER THE NEXT </p><p>MONTH OR TWO WILL BE EXTREMELY KEY IN DETERMINING IF </p><p>THE RELATIONSHIP AWAKES FROM "ITS PRESENT DORMANCY." </p><p> </p><p>4.
