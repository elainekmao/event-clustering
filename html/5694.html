Ref C requests a compliance update on OIG\'s post </p><p>inspection of Embassy Tegucigalpa, ref: ISP-I-02-26.  The </p><p>inspection was completed in February 2001 and has been in </p><p>the compliance reporting phase since that time. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Embassy is providing additional information on the </p><p>outstanding recommendations.  We are not repeating all </p><p>past exchanges for each recommendation -- only the </p><p>original recommendation itself is repeated for your </p><p>reference. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Recommendation 2:  The department should endorse </p><p>embassy Tegucigalpa\'s request for two additional Drug </p><p>Enforcement Administration special agents.  Action: INL, </p><p>in Consultation with Embassy Tegucigalpa. </p><p> </p><p>Updated post response:  In ref A post provided background </p><p>Information to INL on the need for these agents.  We also </p><p>included the new positions in the past two Mission </p><p>Performance Plans for Honduras.  We await further action </p><p>by the INL bureau. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Recommendation 5:  Embassy Tegucigalpa, in </p><p>coordination with the department, should establish </p><p>another junior officer position to do non-immigrant and </p><p>immigrant visa Work.  Action:  Embassy Tegucigalpa and </p><p>CA/EX. </p><p> </p><p>Updated post response:  CA/EX has established and filled </p><p>a new Consular JO position.  The new officer will arrive </p><p>in March 2003.  We assume that CA and WHA will add the </p><p>necessary position support costs to our budget base this </p><p>fiscal year. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Recommendation 6:  Embassy Tegucigalpa, in </p><p>coordination with the Department, should authorize </p><p>another consular FSN position to handle correspondence </p><p>and public inquiries.  Action:  Embassy Tegucigalpa and </p><p>CA/EX. </p><p> </p><p>Updated post response:  As stated in Ref A and </p><p>previously, post is willing to establish a new PSA </p><p>position.  Between WHA and CA, funding issues need to be </p><p>addressed so that post will have the ongoing program or </p><p>MRV budget money to fill this position. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Recommendation 10:  Embassy Tegucigalpa, in </p><p>coordination with the Department, should phase out </p><p>personnel management services provided to Joint Task </p><p>Force Bravo for their host country employees.  Action: </p><p>Embassy Tegucigalpa, in coordination with HR/OE. </p><p> </p><p>Updated post response:  In late September 2002, the </p><p>Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Resources </p><p>(M/DGHR/OE), with the concurrence of OIG/ISP, signed a </p><p>Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Undersecretary of </p><p>Defense for Personnel and Readiness.  Under the new MOA, </p><p>State agrees to exercise its PSA hiring authority for an </p><p>additional two-years with respect to the 62 Honduran </p><p>nationals working at JTF Bravo, with the understanding </p><p>that Defense will seek its own PSA authority from the </p><p>Congress during that time period.  Human resources </p><p>management services for the JTF Bravo Honduran employees </p><p>will continue under the US Mission\'s existing ICASS </p><p>arrangements until September 30, 2004. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
