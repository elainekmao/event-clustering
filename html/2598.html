(C) SUMMARY.  BASED ON OFFICIAL STATISTICS RELEASED </p><p>THUS FAR (WHICH WE HAVE NO WAY TO VERIFY), WE EXPECT </p><p>ZANU-PF TO CLAIM VICTORY IN THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS.  TURNOUT TO DATE, EVEN IN AREAS WHERE VOTING </p><p>HAS BEEN TRUNCATED, HAS EXCEEDED JUNE 2000 LEVELS IN ALL </p><p>PROVINCES SAVE BULAWAYO.  NEVERTHELESS, IT APPEARS LESS </p><p>THAN 60 PERCENT OF THOSE REGISTERED IN JANUARY TURNED UP </p><p>TO VOTE, AND AS WE PREDICTED EARLIER, A LOWER TURNOUT </p><p>FAVORS ZANU-PF.  VOTER INCREASES FROM THE 2000 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WERE HIGHEST IN ZANU-PF </p><p>STRONGHOLDS IN MASHONALAND, LIKELY SUPPLEMENTED BY ZANU- </p><p>PF\'S LAST-MINUTE REGISTRATION CAMPAIGN.  HIGH TURNOUTS </p><p>IN MANICALAND AND MASVINGO MAY PRESENT THE ONLY REAL </p><p>WILD CARD.  SIX MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION, COUPLED WITH THE DIFFICULTIES FACED BY </p><p>URBAN VOTERS, ARE THE ONLY REASONABLE EXPLANATIONS FOR </p><p>THE RELATIVELY LOW TURNOUT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>NUMBERS FAVOR MUGABE AND ZANU-PF </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) OFFICIAL VOTING STATISTICS RELEASED THUS FAR </p><p>IMPLY FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR THE RULING ZANU-PF TO </p><p>DECLARE VICTORY ONCE VOTING HAS CONCLUDED IN THE MARCH </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

(C) WE PREDICTED THAT WITH A 60 PERCENT TURNOUT, MDC </p><p>LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WOULD WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION, ALBEIT BY A NARROW MARGIN.  NUMBERS DO NOT </p><p>QUITE REACH THAT PERCENTAGE LEVEL, HOWEVER.  CURRENT </p><p>NUMBERS SHOW SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 53% OF REGISTERED VOTERS </p><p>TURNED OUT OVER THE WEEKEND THROUGH 5 P.M. ON MARCH 10. </p><p> </p><p>HIGHER PERCENTAGES IN ZANU-PF STRONGHOLDS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) MORE IMPORTANTLY, FROM THESE NUMBERS, IT APPEARS </p><p>THAT THE HIGHEST VOTER TURNOUTS OCCURRED IN TRADITIONAL </p><p>ZANU-PF STRONGHOLDS, THE MASHONALAND PROVINCES.  EACH </p><p>PROVINCE HAD WELL OVER 50% OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS TURN OUT, </p><p>FOR AN OVERALL VOTING TURNOUT AVERAGE OF 58% OF TOTAL </p><p>REGISTERED VOTERS.  MOREOVER, THE MASHONALAND PROVINCES </p><p>EXPERIENCED THE LARGEST INCREASE IN OVERALL VOTERS, </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 179,000 VOTERS.  WE ATTRIBUTE THIS </p><p>INCREASE TO ONE OR BOTH OF TWO FACTORS:  1) A SUCCESSFUL </p><p>EFFORT BY ZANU-PF TO GET OUT LOYAL SUPPORTERS, AND 2) </p><p>STUFFED BALLOT BOXES BY THE RULING PARTY IN THIS LARGELY </p><p>NO-GO AREA FOR THE MDC. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ1215 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00640  02 OF 02  111349Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   M-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /009W </p><p>                  ------------------7280AC  111349Z /38 </p><p>O 111257Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1173 </p><p>INFO OAU COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATE </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000640 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PRETORIA FOR A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR PDAS BELLAMY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/10/07 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: PRELIMINARY VOTING STATISTICS FAVOR </p><p>MUGABE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00640  02 OF 02  111349Z </p><p>TURNOUT IN MDC STRONGHOLDS LOWER THAN EXPECTED </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE MOST SURPRISING THING REFLECTED IN OFFICIAL </p><p>STATISTICS IS THE LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED TURNOUT IN </p><p>EXPECTED MDC STRONGHOLDS, ESPECIALLY IN BULAWAYO, THE </p><p>ONLY PLACE WHERE VOTER TURNOUT IS LOWER THAN IN THE JUNE </p><p>2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  WE EXPECT THAT ONCE </p><p>VOTING RECOMMENCES IN HARARE, THOSE NUMBERS WILL HEAVILY </p><p>FAVOR THE MDC.  PRESENTLY, OVERALL VOTER TURNOUT IN MDC </p><p>STRONGHOLDS IS AROUND 48.36%, WELL BELOW THAT PROJECTED. </p><p>AS REPORTED PREVIOUSLY, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THIS </p><p>DECLINE IS EXPLAINED BY THE GOZ DECISION TO PROVIDE A </p><p>REDUCED NUMBER OF POLLING PLACES IN A COMPLEX DOUBLE AND </p><p>TRIPLE-TIER ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>MASVINGO AND MANICALAND ONLY WILDCARDS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE ONLY OTHER PROVINCES WITH MORE THAN 50 </p><p>PERCENT VOTER TURNOUT WAS IN MANICALAND AND MASVINGO, </p><p>WHERE 55% AND 58%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THOSE REGISTERED </p><p>TURNED OUT TO VOTE.  MANICALAND SPLITS APPROXIMATELY 60- </p><p>40 FAVORING THE MDC OVER THE RULING ZANU-PF.  THE ZANU- </p><p>PF CANNOT AT PRESENT LAY CLAIM TO ITS HISTORICAL </p><p>STRONGHOLD IN MASVINGO HOWEVER, DUE TO THE WELL- </p><p>PUBLICIZED DISPUTE BETWEEN ZANU-PF STRONGMAN EDDISON </p><p>ZVOBGO AND PRESIDENT MUGABE.  WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS </p><p>THAT ZVOBGO ENERGIZED HIS SUPPORTERS TO GET OUT AND </p><p>VOTE, BUT FOR TSVANGIRAI INSTEAD OF MUGABE.  EVEN SO, </p><p>ZVOBGO NEVER EXPECTED THE MDC TO DO MORE THAN SPLIT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00640  02 OF 02  111349Z </p><p>MASVINGO VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO PREDICT A WINNER, AS </p><p>VOTING CONTINUES IN HARARE AND CHITUNGWIZA.  IT IS ALSO </p><p>IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE BASED ON </p><p>OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT FIGURES, WHICH MAY DIFFER VASTLY </p><p>FROM THE REAL VOTER TURNOUT.  THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH </p><p>THESE STATISTICAL RELEASES AND INFORMATION MINISTER </p><p>JONATHAN MOYO\'S ANALYSES ON RADIO, HAS SOUGHT TO BUILD </p><p>EXPECTATIONS FOR A LARGE RURAL AND SMALL URBAN TURNOUT. </p><p>OUR TEAMS NOTICED MASSIVE VOTER TURNOUTS IN MDC </p><p>STRONGHOLDS ON MARCH 9, WHICH RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE </p><p>RELIABILITY OF THE GOZ DATA.  NEVERTHELESS, SHOULD THE </p><p>DATA HOLD UP ON FURTHER REVIEW, IT APPEARS THAT THE </p><p>GOZ\'S 6 MONTH CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION, </p><p>COUPLED WITH THE CALCULATED CONFUSION WROUGHT BY </p><p>DECREASING URBAN POLLING STATIONS, INCREASING RURAL </p><p>STATIONS, AND CONFLICTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE VOTER </p><p>ROLLS, HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
