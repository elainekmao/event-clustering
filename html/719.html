<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TOKYO 003257 </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356:  DECL: 25 JUL 2025 </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, ASEAN, APEC, NPT, UNSC, BX, JA </p><p>SUBJECT:  BRUNEI FOREIGN MINISTER MOHAMED BOLKIAH\'S </p><p>          MARCH 7 - 9 VISIT TO JAPAN </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  BRUNEI FOREIGN MINISTER MOHAMED BOLKIAH </p><p>VISITED JAPAN MARCH 7 - 9 IN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY AND </p><p>VACATIONED IN TOKYO THROUGH THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND.  HE </p><p>MET WITH THE EMPEROR, CROWN PRINCE, AND GOJ FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER KONO.  WITH THE LATTER HE DISCUSSED THE ASEAN </p><p>REGIONAL FORUM (ARF) AND PMC, NORTH KOREA, NPT </p><p>EXTENSION, UN REFORM, APEC, AND BILATERAL ISSUES.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  MOFA 2ND SOUTHEAST ASIA DIVISION DEPUTY DIRECTOR </p><p>MAEDA ON MARCH 16 BRIEFED US ON BRUNEI FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER PRINCE MOHAMED BOLKIAH\'S MARCH 7 - 9 VISIT TO </p><p>JAPAN, DURING WHICH HE HAD AN AUDIENCE WITH THE </p><p>EMPEROR AND CROWN PRINCE AND MET AND JOINED IN A </p><p>WORKING DINNER WITH GOJ FM KONO.  MAEDA SAID THAT THE </p><p>JAPANESE HAD SUGGESTED MOHAMED\'S VISIT, PRIMARILY TO </p><p>DISCUSS ISSUES RELATED TO BRUNEI\'S 1995 CHAIRMANSHIP </p><p>OF ASEAN.  ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WIFE AND NINE OF HIS </p><p>CHILDREN, MOHAMED REMAINED IN JAPAN DURING THE </p><p>FOLLOWING WEEKEND, WHICH HE SPENT AT DISNEYLAND TO </p><p>CELEBRATE THE END OF THIS YEAR\'S RAMADAN SEASON. </p><p> </p><p>ASEAN </p><p>----- </p><p>4.  MOHAMED DISCUSSED MEMBERSHIP ISSUES PERTAINING TO </p><p>ASEAN AND ITS ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>ASEAN CURRENTLY SUPPORTS THE NOTION THAT, IF A COUNTRY </p><p>HAS OBSERVER STATUS AT AN ASEAN EVENT, SUCH A COUNTRY </p><p>SHOULD BE ALLOWED FULL MEMBERSHIP IN THE ARF.  THUS, </p><p>IN MOHAMED\'S VIEW (AND, ACCORDING TO HIM, IN ASEAN\'S </p><p>VIEW), CAMBODIA SHOULD BE ALLOWED FULL MEMBERSHIP </p><p>STATUS IN THE ARF RATHER THAN ITS HERETOFORE LESSER </p><p>STATUS.  MOHAMED SAID THAT AUSTRALIAN FM EVNS HAD </p><p>RECENTLY EXPRESSED AGREEMENT WITH THIS POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MOHAMED SAID THAT THE ASEAN COUNTRIES ALSO BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THE ARF MEETING LAST YEAR WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH AND </p><p>SHOULD BE EXTENDED.  ASEAN WOULD BE WILLING TO SHORTEN </p><p>THE PMC TO ACCOMMODATE THIS CHANGE.  MOHAMED SAID THAT </p><p>ASEAN IS NOW CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING </p><p>SUCH A CHANGE IN THE ARF/PMC SCHEDULE.  DECISION- </p><p>MAKING WITHIN ARF SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT ON A "STRICTLY </p><p>CONSENSUS BASIS," MOHAMED SAID.  THE "SPEED" OF THE </p><p>ARF\'S DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE SOMETHING WITH WHICH ALL </p><p>PARTICIPANTS ARE "COMFORTABLE," HE FURTHER ADVISED </p><p> </p><p>6.  MOHAMED SAID THAT IT WOULD BE "REASONABLE" FOR </p><p>NORTH KOREA AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE TO JOIN THE </p><p>ARF.  HE REFERRED TO ASEAN\'S POLICY OF ENGAGEMENT WITH </p><p>BURMA AND SAID THAT A SIMILAR POLICY OF INCLUSION </p><p>MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA. </p><p> </p><p>NORTH KOREA </p><p>----------- </p><p>7.  MOHAMED SAID THAT BRUNEI WOULD LIKE TO COOPERATE </p><p>WITH KEDO "AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE."  HE SAID THAT THE </p><p>ASEAN COUNTRIES WERE THINKING ABOUT ASKING TO JOIN </p><p>KEDO AS ASEAN AND NOT IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES. </p><p> </p><p>NPT </p><p>--- </p><p>8.  KONO EXPRESSED JAPAN\'S SUPPORT FOR THE UNLIMITED </p><p>EXTENSION OF THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY.  HE </p><p>ASKED THAT BRUNEI ADOPT A SIMILAR POSITION.  MOHAMED </p><p>COMMENTED THAT THE U.S. HAS BEEN ENERGETICALLY </p><p>LOBBYING BRUNEI TO SUPPORT UNLIMITED EXTENSION.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT BRUNEI\'S POSITION IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE </p><p>NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT BUT HE COMMENTED THAT, IN LIGHT </p><p>OF KONO\'S REQUEST, BRUNEI WOULD GIVE THE QUESTION OF </p><p>UNLIMITED EXTENSION "DUE CONSIDERATION." </p><p> </p><p>UN ISSUES </p><p>--------- </p><p>9.  MAEDA NOTED THAT BRUNEI HAS IN THE PAST EXPRESSED </p><p>SUPPORT AT THE WORKING-LEVEL FOR JAPAN\'S OBTAINING A </p><p>PERMANENT UNSC SEAT.  MOHAMED TOLD KONO THAT BRUNEI </p><p>SUPPORTS SUCH A SEAT FOR JAPAN.  MAEDA SAID THAT THE </p><p>JAPANESE WERE PLEASED WITH THIS UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT </p><p>AND THAT IT WAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SUPPORT JAPAN HAS </p><p>SO FAR RECEIVED FROM BRUNEI. </p><p> </p><p>APEC </p><p>---- </p><p>10.  BRUNEI\'S FOREIGN MINISTER EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR </p><p>JAPAN\'S "PARTNERSHIP FOR PROGRESS" CONCEPT OF REGIONAL </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS AN APEC ACTIVITY.  MOHAMED </p><p>SAID THAT HE WAS NOT OPPOSED TO OTHER SUGGESTED APEC </p><p>ACTIVITIES (E.G., TRADE LIBERALIZATION) BUT THAT IT </p><p>WAS IMPORTANT ALSO TO WORK ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS </p><p>JAPAN HAS SUGGESTED IN ITS PARTNERSHIP CONCEPT. </p><p> </p><p>BILATERAL ISSUES </p><p>---------------- </p><p>11.  THE JAPANESE THANKED MOHAMED FOR THE ASSISTANCE </p><p>(BOTTLED WATER, CLOTHES, FOOD) THAT BRUNEI PROVIDED IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE JANUARY KOBE EARTHQUAKE.  MAEDA </p><p>COMMENTED THAT BRUNEI LEASED TRUCKS AND DISTRIBUTED </p><p>THE GOODS ITSELF, WITHOUT INVOLVING THE GOJ.  HE SAID </p><p>THAT THE GOJ WELCOMED THE INITIATIVE BRUNEI TOOK IN </p><p>THAT REGARD.  MOHAMED THANKED JAPAN FOR ITS </p><p>COOPERATION IN HAVING SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED LAST FALL </p><p>A BILATERAL AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE REGULAR DIRECT </p><p>FLIGHTS BETWEEN OSAKA AND BRUNEI.  THERE ARE NOW TWO </p><p>FLIGHTS A WEEK.  MAEDA SAID THAT NO JAPANESE CARRIERS </p><p>HAVE ASKED TO FLY THIS ROUTE, ALTHOUGH THE JAPANESE </p><p>ARE ENTITLED UNDER LAST FALL\'S AGREEMENT TO DO SO IF </p><p>THEY WANT THEM.  THUS ONLY BRUNEI\'S CARRIER IS NOW </p><p>USING THE ROUTE. </p><p> </p><p>12.  KONO AND MOHAMED DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT BRUNEI </p><p>WILL SOON "GRADUATE" FROM THE OECD\'S DAC LIST AND WILL </p><p>THEREFORE BECOME INELIGIBLE FOR JAPANESE OFFICIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.  MAEDA SAID THAT THIS WOULD </p><p>OCCUR AROUND THE BEGINNING OF 1996.  BOTH SIDES WOULD </p><p>LIKE TO CONTINUE SOME FORM OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION TO </p><p>REPLACE JAPAN\'S ODA PROGRAM BUT NOTHING FIRM HAS BEEN </p><p>DECIDED.  MAEDA SAID THAT BRUNEI, BECAUSE OF A LACK OF </p><p>EXPERIENCE AND HUMAN RESOURCES, WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE </p><p>IN THE POSITION THAT SINGAPORE WAS WHEN JAPAN AND </p><p>SINGAPORE WORKED OUT THEIR ONGOING "PARTNERSHIP </p><p>PROGRAM."  UNDER THIS PROGRAM, JAPAN AND SINGAPORE ARE </p><p>TO CARRY OUT A FIVE-YEAR EFFORT, FUNDED INITIALLY IN </p><p>LARGE PART BY JAPAN BUT FUNDED TOWARD THE END MAINLY </p><p>BY SINGAPORE, UNDER WHICH JAPAN WILL ASSIST SINGAPORE </p><p>IN BECOMING AN ODA DONOR RATHER THAN RECIPIENT.  MAEDA </p><p>SAID THAT BRUNEI IS NOT AT A STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT </p><p>WHERE A SIMILAR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WOULD BE </p><p>APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  COMMENT:  CONSISTENT WITH MAEDA\'S ASSESSMENT, </p><p>MOHAMED\'S VISIT TO JAPAN APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FAIRLY </p><p>ROUTINE.  THE JAPANESE SIDE MADE ITS USUAL POINTS ON </p><p>UN ISSUES AND ON THE APEC "PARTNERSHIP FOR PROGRESS" </p><p>CONCEPT.  WE NOTE THAT IN RECENT HIGH LEVEL EXCHANGES, </p><p>THE JAPANESE HAVE BEGUN INCLUDING THE NPT EXTENSION </p><p>ISSUE AS AN AGENDA ITEM.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  MONDLE </p><p></p></div>
