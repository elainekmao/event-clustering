<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000781 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR EAP/BCLTV - LAWLESS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, JO, EG, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: EGYPTIAN QIZ\'S IN JORDANIAN PERSPECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>REF: CAIRO 846 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  SUMMARY:  Activating the QIZ initiative in Egypt </p><p>through parallel protocols would have profound effects on the </p><p>long-term viability of QIZ\'s in Jordan.  More seriously, such </p><p>a deal would cause deep concern within the GOJ about </p><p>equitable treatment for the politically tough decisions </p><p>Jordan has made with regard to normalizing relations with </p><p>Israel.  Especially at this sensitive time, we believe </p><p>activation of Egyptian participation in the QIZ initiative </p><p>should not be done in such a way as to expose the GOJ to </p><p>strong domestic criticism for giving up more than it had to </p><p>politically vis-a-vis Israel.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>ECONOMIC IMPACT PREDICTABLY BAD </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  We expect senior levels of the GOJ to react with </p><p>dismay when news that Egypt is activating its QIZ option gets </p><p>out.  Economically, this is predictable, as full Egyptian </p><p>participation in the QIZ initiative would severely curtail </p><p>QIZ sales and new investment in Jordan.  For example, the </p><p>Vice President for Sourcing of Target, in a recent visit to </p><p>Amman, told us that preferential access to the U.S. market </p><p>along the lines of the QIZ initiative would make Egypt\'s </p><p>vertically integrated textile industry a far more </p><p>advantageous place to source from than Jordan, which lacks </p><p>both the high-quality local cotton and the vertical </p><p>integration. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  In addition to the impact on the nascent </p><p>western-oriented business sector, diversion of QIZ business </p><p>to Egypt would have severe repercussions on Jordan\'s balance </p><p>of payments and the King\'s efforts to diversify the economy </p><p>away from dependence on foreign aid, remittances, and exports </p><p>to Iraq.  The QIZ\'s were responsible for over $400 million in </p><p>gross hard currency inflows in 2002 (5% of GDP and 20% of </p><p>total exports).  Exports of $600-800 million are possible </p><p>this year, more than combined U.S. military and economic </p><p>assistance.  According to a recent study by the EU assistance </p><p>mission, QIZ exports have the potential to reach $2.6 billion </p><p>annually as soon as 2007 -- under current conditions. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>POLITICAL COSTS EVEN MORE DAMAGING </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  More disturbing, though, is the major political </p><p>embarrassment that Egypt\'s participation in the QIZ </p><p>initiative on "easier" political terms could cause the GOJ. </p><p>Should Egypt activate its QIZ participation in the same </p><p>manner as the GOJ did, i.e. with an agreement between the GOE </p><p>and the GOI, Jordan would have no real political exposure. </p><p>If, however, the Egyptians use a parallel protocols mechanism </p><p>(reftel), we expect the GOJ to register deep concern.  The </p><p>GOJ took brave political risks to initiate the QIZ\'s, </p><p>invoking the ire of anti-normalization groups and provoking </p><p>death threats against some of the early investors.  Since </p><p>then, the success of the initiative has quieted </p><p>anti-normalization voices.  In addition, in providing jobs to </p><p>over 20,000 (primarily rural, conservative) Jordanians, the </p><p>QIZ\'s have played an important role in changing public </p><p>attitudes about working with Israel. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  All of these gains would be put at risk if Egypt was </p><p>seen by the GOJ as getting an "easier deal" than Jordan </p><p>received.  The GOJ will perceive this as favoritism toward </p><p>Egypt, obliging Jordan to make public and direct </p><p>government-to-government ties to Israel, while Egypt is not </p><p>asked to take similar risks.  This analysis, irrespective of </p><p>the economic impact of competition for QIZ sales and </p><p>investment, would light a hitherto smoldering fire under the </p><p>anti-normalizers.  Worse, it would dissuade forward-leaning </p><p>Jordanians from taking on new political risks vis-a-vis </p><p>Israel, on the assumption that, if they wait long enough, </p><p>they can get "Egyptian terms."  It will also dissuade liberal </p><p>Jordanian businessmen from reaching out to do business with </p><p>Israel out of fear they could be undercut later on by more </p><p>"favorable" treatment third countries receive.  Finally, it </p><p>will disappoint Jordanian workers (those that remain after </p><p>the economic effects reveal themselves), who will perceive </p><p>Egyptian workers as getting the benefits of the QIZ\'s without </p><p>having to work with Israel.  Whether or not this is true </p><p>would be irrelevant - the perception would be the same. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  While Egypt\'s long-overdue participation in the QIZ </p><p>initiative will cause serious economic disruption to Jordan\'s </p><p>nascent garment sector, this is a normal facet of the </p><p>cut-throat global textile industry.  Jordan has always known </p><p>it would need to deal with competition from abroad, and </p><p>should be expected to find ways to compensate for the </p><p>disruption (re-training, diversification, etc).  In any </p><p>event, there will still be a niche for Jordanian garment </p><p>exports: The inclusion of Egypt might even create new </p><p>partnership opportunities among QIZ exporters, and Jordan </p><p>will still be a good sourcing option for synthetic </p><p>fabric-based garments, where Egyptian advantages in cotton </p><p>and vertical integration are not as much in play.  The GOJ\'s </p><p>track record on QIZ investor support and on relations with </p><p>Israeli counterparts could also be a distinct advantage. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  That said, bringing Egypt into the QIZ fold needs to </p><p>be managed in such a way that it does not overturn the </p><p>political sacrifices Jordan made.  Preserving the momentum </p><p>the QIZ\'s have generated in beating back the </p><p>anti-normalization lobby means making sure that hard-won </p><p>benefits are not given to other countries that have not been </p><p>asked to make the same difficult decisions. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
