POPE </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) SUMMARY.  THE GOI WILL VIEW WITH GREAT INTEREST, AND </p><p>SOME CONCERN, PRECISE PLANS FOR RESTRUCTURING/DOWNSIZING OF </p><p>UNIFIL.  THIS STEMS IN LARGE PART FROM TODAY\'S HEIGHTENED </p><p>TENSIONS IN THE REGION, BUT IS ALSO LINKED TO ITALY\'S GENERAL </p><p>PREFERENCE FOR EMPLOYING MULTILATERAL PEACEKEEPING FORCES. </p><p>ABOVE ALL, THE GOI WISHES TO BE A PLAYER IN THE REGION WHILE </p><p>MAINTAINING A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE USG.  EARLY AND </p><p>CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH ITALY WILL BE THE KEY FACTOR IN </p><p>SECURING SUPPORT FOR US VIEWS ON UNIFIL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) REFTEL SEEKS POST\'S OPINION OF LIKELY ITALIAN VIEWS ON </p><p>UNIFIL DOWNSIZING.  WHILE ITALY IS AWARE OF UNIFIL\'S </p><p>SHORTCOMINGS -- AND WILL THEREFORE LIKELY BACK CONTINUED </p><p>RESTRUCTURING -- IT WOULD PROBABLY VIEW WITH CONCERN ANY </p><p>CHANGES THAT MIGHT/MIGHT LEAD TO GREATER INSTABILITY. </p><p>ACCORDINGLY, THE PRECISE NATURE OF THE RESTRUCTURING WILL BE </p><p>KEY, AS WILL ADDRESSING ITS LIKELY IMPACT ON THE SITUATION ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00066  041810Z </p><p>THE GROUND. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) EVEN IF PRESENT TENSIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST WERE TO </p><p>EASE, HOWEVER, ITALY\'S GENERALLY FAVORABLE ATTITUDE TOWARD </p><p>MULTILATERAL PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS WOULD BE A FACTOR.  SO </p><p>WOULD THE GOI\'S DESIRE TO EXERT INFLUENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST </p><p>AND PM BERLUSCONI\'S COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING WHAT HE VIEWS </p><p>AS A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH WASHINGTON. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN SUM, SECURING AND MAINTAINING ITALIAN SUPPORT FOR </p><p>US VIEWS ON UNIFIL WILL TURN IN LARGE PART ON EARLY AND </p><p>FREQUENT CONSULTATIONS AT SENIOR LEVELS.  SHOULD THESE FAIL </p><p>TO BEAR FRUIT, INTERVENTIONS AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL MAY BE </p><p>NECESSARY. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00066 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
