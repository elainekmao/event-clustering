(C)  SUMMARY:  AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM OF MEDICAL EXPERTS </p><p>TOLD DIPLOMATS JUNE 5, FOLLOWING A FACT-FINDING MISSION, THAT </p><p>THEY HAD FOUND "CLEAR OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMATIC </p><p>TORTURE" IN ZIMBABWE THAT IS ELECTION-RELATED.  AFTER </p><p>EXAMINING TEN PURPORTED VICTIMS OF PHYSICAL AND </p><p>PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE BY GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS, THE TEAM </p><p>DETERMINED THAT THEIR ALLEGATIONS WERE CREDIBLE.  THEY SAID </p><p>THAT SOME VICTIMS HAD BEEN TORTURED IN OR NEAR A MEDICAL </p><p>FACILITY OWNED BY WAR VETERAN LEADER CHENJERAI "HITLER" </p><p>HUNZVI, ALTHOUGH THEY DO NOT PLAN TO NAME HUNZVI SPECIFICALLY </p><p>IN THEIR PUBLISHED REPORT.  THE DOCTORS SAID THAT THESE CASES </p><p>AND OTHERS LIKE THEM, AS WELL AS PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE SUCH </p><p>AS FORCED REPUDIATION OF POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS, CONTRIBUTE TO A </p><p>CLIMATE OF WIDESPREAD INTIMIDATION AND TRAUMA.  THEY CALLED </p><p>ON THE GOZ TO ADHERE TO THE UN CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE, </p><p>ADOPT A POLICY OF REPARATION FOR VICTIMS AND APPOINT AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF </p><p>TORTURE.  THESE FINDINGS CERTAINLY TRACK WITH THE DISTURBING </p><p>INFORMATION WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MANDATE OF FACT-FINDING TEAM </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  AT THE REQUEST OF THE AMANI TRUST, A LOCAL NGO THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03029  01 OF 03  071024Z </p><p>ASSISTS VICTIMS OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT TORTURE IN ZIMBABWE, </p><p>A TEAM OF MEDICAL EXPERTS FROM THE COPENHAGEN-BASED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL REHABILITATION COUNCIL FOR TORTURE VICTIMS </p><p>CONDUCTED A FACT-FINDING MISSION TO EXAMINE ALLEGATIONS OF </p><p>WIDESPREAD STATE-SPONSORED TORTURE.  MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>DELEGATION, WHICH WAS LED BY INGE GENEFKE, A WIDELY RESPECTED </p><p>DANISH NEUROLOGIST, WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>ALLEGATIONS THAT DOCTORS AND HEALTH WORKERS WERE IMPLICATED </p><p>IN THE ONGOING ACTS OF TORTURE, AND ABOUT THE REPORTED </p><p>DISRUPTION OF HEALTH CARE DUE TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION IN THE RUN-UP TO THE JUNE 24-25 PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THE DELEGATION MET IN HARARE AND BULAWAYO WITH </p><p>VICTIMS, VICTIMS\' ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS, AND ORGANIZATIONS OF </p><p>HEALTH WORKERS.  DR. GENEFKE AND HER COLLEAGUES CONDUCTED AN </p><p>EU-HOSTED BRIEFING OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS JUNE 5 ABOUT THE TEN- </p><p>DAY FACT-FINDING MISSION.  THE DOCTORS PLAN TO ISSUE A REPORT IN </p><p>SEVERAL DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>VICTIMS OF PHYSICAL TORTURE </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  THE DOCTORS EXAMINED SIX VICTIMS OF TORTURE IN </p><p>BULAWAYO AND FOUR IN HARARE.  THEY TOLD THE DIPLOMATS THAT, </p><p>USING RELIABLE SCIENTIFIC METHODS, THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>CONFIRM THAT ALL TEN HAD BEEN VICTIMS OF PHYSICAL AND </p><p>PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE.  THE PERPETRATORS OF THE TORTURE, </p><p>ACCORDING THE TEAM, HAD NOT BEEN POLICE OR SOLDIERS, AS IS OFTEN </p><p>THE CASE IN OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT RATHER "REGULAR PEOPLE," </p><p>INCLUDING WOMEN, WHO ARE SUPPORTERS OF THE GOVERNMENT (AND </p><p>ZANU-PF).  PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS TEACHERS AND MEDICAL WORKERS </p><p>HAD, THEY SAID, BEEN SINGLED OUT FOR TORTURE, A COMMON TACTIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03029  01 OF 03  071024Z </p><p>WHEN PERPETRATORS ARE SETTING OUT TO DESTROY A COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  THE DOCTORS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL ONE CASE IN WHICH TWENTY </p><p>MEN ATTACKED AN OPPOSITION PARTY MEMBER AT HIS HOME, BEATING </p><p>HIM UNCONSCIOUS IN FRONT OF HIS WIFE AND FOUR-YEAR-OLD CHILD. </p><p>DAMAGE INCLUDED BOTH PHYSICAL WOUNDS, SUCH AS  CIGARETTE </p><p>BURNS AND INJURIES FROM BEATINGS, AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA </p><p>INCLUDING THE FOUR-YEAR-OLD\'S HOSTILITY TO HIS FATHER </p><p>FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT -- A COMMON, AND OFTEN LASTING, </p><p>REACTION BY CHILDREN WITNESSING THE TORTURE OF A PARENT. </p><p> </p><p>ABUSES BY HUNZVI </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ACCORDING TO THE DOCTORS, THEY HAD RECEIVED "VERY CLEAR </p><p>INFORMATION" THAT THE FOUR VICTIMS IN HARARE HAD BEEN </p><p>TORTURED IN OR NEAR A MEDICAL OFFICE RUN BY WAR VETERAN </p><p>LEADER CHENJERAI "HITLER" HUNZVI, WHO IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR.  THEY </p><p>SAID THEY DO NOT PLAN TO DISCUSS HUNZVI BY NAME IN THE REPORT, </p><p>BUT WILL DISCUSS HIS INVOLVEMENT WHEN THEY REPORT BACK TO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS.  ANTONY REELER, DIRECTOR </p><p>OF AMANI TRUST, SAID THAT THIS ISSUE IS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED </p><p>IN "DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS" BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL </p><p>HEALTH GROUPS.  HE NOTED THAT A SUPPORTER OF THE MOVEMENT FOR </p><p>DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) HAD BEEN BEATEN TO DEATH OUTSIDE </p><p>HUNZVI\'S MEDICAL OFFICE.  THE OFFICE HAS REPORTEDLY SINCE BEEN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5883 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03029  02 OF 03  071024Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-01  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00 </p><p>      INL-01   DODE-00  DOEE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------600078  071026Z /38 </p><p>P 071028Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6221 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY COPENHAGEN </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 003029 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR A/S RICE, P/DAS POWELL, DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p>AF/S FOR A.

(U)  THE DOCTORS SAID THAT THEY HAD FOUND "CLEAR OBJECTIVE </p><p>EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMATIC TORTURE," WHICH INCLUDED BOTH PHYSICAL </p><p>TORTURE AND THREATS AND INTIMIDATION THAT CONSTITUTE "MASS </p><p>PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE ON A VERY LARGE SCALE."  EXAMPLES OF </p><p>PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE INCLUDE DEATH THREATS AND FORCING </p><p>PEOPLE TO WITNESS THE TORTURE OF THEIR RELATIVES AND LOVED </p><p>ONES.  THE DOCTORS TOLD THE DIPLOMATS THAT INTIMIDATION SUCH AS </p><p>FORCED ATTENDANCE AT POLITICAL RALLIES AND FORCED </p><p>RENUNCIATION OF POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS AND BELIEFS CAN LEAVE </p><p>EMOTIONAL SCARS AS DEEP AS, AND MORE WIDESPREAD THAN, THOSE </p><p>CAUSED BY PHYSICAL TORTURE.  THEY ADDED THAT THEY HAVE </p><p>OBSERVED PHENOMENON OF "SELF-CENSORSHIP" WHEREBY VICTIMS ARE </p><p>UNWILLING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM FOR FEAR OF </p><p>RETALIATION.  THIS SILENCING IS "EXTREMELY DANGEROUS FOR THE </p><p>COUNTRY." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  THE PERPETRATORS OF THE VIOLENCE, THE DOCTORS SAID, HAD </p><p>TARGETED PROFESSIONALS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS, INCLUDING </p><p>TEACHERS AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS.  SINGLING OUT SUCH PEOPLE </p><p>FOR TORTURE AFFECTS NOT ONLY THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES, </p><p>BUT THE WHOLE SOCIETY.  "TORTURE," THEY CONTINUED, "IS THE MOST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03029  02 OF 03  071024Z </p><p>ATROCIOUS INSTRUMENT AGAINST DEMOCRACY." </p><p> </p><p>DISRUPTION OF HEALTH SERVICES </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  THE DOCTORS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE DISRUPTIVE </p><p>EFFECTS OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION ON THE HEALTH CARE </p><p>PROFESSION.  IN SOME CASES, HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>PREVENTED FROM PROVIDING TREATMENT TO VICTIMS.  WAR VETERANS </p><p>HAVE REPORTEDLY EXHIBITED THREATENING BEHAVIOR TOWARD </p><p>HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, INCLUDING ASSAULTING AND RAPING </p><p>NURSES.  TWO NURSES WERE ABDUCTED WHILE WORKING IN A </p><p>MATERNAL CARE WARD, DR. GENEFKE ASSERTED.  SEVERAL VICTIMS OF </p><p>TORTURE HAD SWITCHED HOSPITALS AFTER ENCOUNTERING COLD AND </p><p>INDIFFERENT BEHAVIOR ON THE PART OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. </p><p>THE BEHAVIOR OF THESE HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS, THE DOCTORS </p><p>MAINTAINED, WAS THE RESULT OF INTIMIDATION RATHER THAN </p><p>INDIFFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>SCALE OF VIOLENCE </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U)  ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF TORTURE VICTIMS, ANTONY </p><p>REELER OF AMANI TRUST SAID THAT NGO\'S HAD IDENTIFIED ABOUT 100 </p><p>VICTIMS OF PHYSICAL TORTURE SO FAR.  HE NOTED THAT THE ONLY </p><p>VICTIMS WHO HAD BEEN ABLE TO COME FORWARD WERE THOSE WHO </p><p>WERE BASED IN OR HAD MANAGED TO MAKE THEIR WAY TO URBAN </p><p>AREAS.  REELER BELIEVES THAT THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS WILL </p><p>EVENTUALLY BE FOUND TO NUMBER IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS. </p><p> </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03029  02 OF 03  071024Z </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  THE GROUP PLANS TO ISSUE A REPORT IN WHICH IT WILL </p><p>RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING COURSE OF ACTION FOR THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT (GOZ): </p><p> </p><p>-- IMMEDIATELY ACCEDE TO THE U.N. CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE. </p><p> </p><p>-- APPOINT AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-- IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM OF REPARATIONS, COMPENSATION, AND </p><p>REHABILITATION FOR VICTIMS OF TORTURE. </p><p> </p><p>ABUSES OF FOREIGN NATIONALS </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU)  MEMBERS OF THE FACT-FINDING MISSION ASKED THE </p><p>DIPLOMATS FOR INFORMATION ON ABUSES OF THEIR NATIONALS.  THE </p><p>DIPLOMATS RESPONDED AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>AMERICAN: AMERICAN RESIDENTS IN ZIMBABWE HAVE WITNESSED </p><p>SEVERAL INCIDENCES OF VIOLENCE, INCLUDING SOME COMMITTED BY </p><p>WAR VETERANS ON THEIR PROPERTY, BUT HAVE NOT THEMSELVES BEEN </p><p>VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5887 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03029  03 OF 03  071024Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-01  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------60009B  071026Z /38 </p><p>P 071028Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6222 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY COPENHAGEN </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 003029 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF FOR A/S RICE, P/DAS POWELL, DAS SCHNEIDMAN </p><p>AF/S FOR A.
