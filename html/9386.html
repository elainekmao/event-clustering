<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 004332 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINR, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: KING SAYS MINOR CABINET RESHUFFLE SOON, NEW </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN THE FALL </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>SMALL CABINET RESHUFFLE IN THE WORKS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  King Abdullah told the Ambassador July 13 that he </p><p>has been working with Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb on the </p><p>details of a small cabinet reshuffle to be announced in the </p><p>next few days.  The King said that Abul Ragheb had wanted to </p><p>change 5-6 ministers, but the King told him to limit it to </p><p>2-3.  Although Abul Ragheb had wanted to change some of the </p><p>"active" ministers -- including Minister of Planning Bassam </p><p>Awadallah -- the King commented that all of the progressive </p><p>ministers with which the U.S. is used to deal would remain in </p><p>the new cabinet.  "I cannot give Bassam an award for </p><p>organizing the WEF (World Economic Forum at the Dead Sea), </p><p>then scrap him as minister."  The King singled out Deputy PM </p><p>and Minister of Justice Faris Nabulsi as a cabinet member who </p><p>is "tired and wants to leave" the government. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>BUT NO NEW PM UNTIL THE FALL </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  The King said he had no intention of changing PM at </p><p>this juncture, but would wait until the convening of the </p><p>regular session of Parliament (likely in October, but could </p><p>be as late as December) before nominating a new government. </p><p>The King said he anticipated that any new ministers appointed </p><p>now would remain in a new government in the fall.  He </p><p>understands the importance of continuity in implementing </p><p>reform and government policy. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>GOJ MAY COME UNDER SOME FIRE FROM NEW PARLIAMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  With the opening of Parliament this week, we expect </p><p>to see calls for changes of individual ministers.  One </p><p>informed Jordanian told the Ambassador July 13 that Planning </p><p>Minster Awadallah, ITC Minister Zo\'bi, Education Minister </p><p>Touqan, Health Minister Maani, and Municipal and Rural </p><p>Affairs Minister Tubaishat would likely receive the most </p><p>criticism.  Parliamentary Speaker candidate Saad Hayel Srour </p><p>told PolCouns last week that, despite what he expected would </p><p>be a large number of ad hominem attacks on individual </p><p>ministers during the first few weeks of Parliament -- and </p><p>especially if the PM submits the government to the Parliament </p><p>for a vote of confidence -- he is certain that, at the end of </p><p>the day, the government would receive 70 plus votes of </p><p>confidence out of 110. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  The King implied, but did not state definitively, </p><p>that he would replace Abul Ragheb as PM in the fall.  Abul </p><p>Ragheb himself seems to have been trying to engineer a more </p><p>extensive government reshuffle now and put more of his people </p><p>in place to make it more difficult for the King to appoint a </p><p>new PM in the fall. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
