LIZ CHENEY, </p><p>NEA/PPD MACINESS, BOURGEOIS, </p><p>NEA/RA KWALKER, GGRAPPO, HPIERCE, BKEARY, MSPIRNAK; </p><p>NEA/ARN SZIADEH, </p><p>G/IWI </p><p>NEA/PI AROMANOWSKI, HPEIRCE, CBOURGEOIS, TSTASIUK, TWINCUP, </p><p>SFRANCESKI, RKAPLAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, EAID, BTIO, PGOV, SOCI, KWMN, PREL, KDEM, SCUL, BEXP, PHUM, KPAO, XF, JO, ETRO </p><p>SUBJECT:  Jordan MEPI Strategy </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) State 126550     B) Amman 01650 </p><p> </p><p>     C) State 145089     D) State 155970 </p><p> </p><p>1.   Following per State 126550 is the post\'s integrated </p><p>MEPI strategy divided into the three MEPI Pillars: A) </p><p>Economic Reform and Private Enterprise b) Political Reform </p><p>and C) Education. Our approach is based on the good </p><p>governance and citizen awareness strategy outlined in reftel </p><p>B plus the Jordan Mission Program Plan and USAID\'s proposed </p><p>activities in education. </p><p> </p><p>Economic Pillar (ECON) </p><p> </p><p>2. Situation Analysis </p><p>King Abdullah has made economic reform his highest priority </p><p>and has taken key (and sometimes politically costly) steps </p><p>to institute reform.  Beset by high unemployment and </p><p>population growth rates, modest per capita economic growth, </p><p>inadequate water and regional instability, Jordan is taking </p><p>energetic measures to attack its problems.  The Government </p><p>has focused on increasing the role of the private sector and </p><p>improving the country\'s investment climate by pursuing sound </p><p>economic policies and trade and investment liberalization, </p><p>including a landmark Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the U. </p><p>S. that went into effect December 2001.  GDP growth has </p><p>strengthened since 2000, yet high poverty and unemployment </p><p>rates remain significant problems. </p><p> </p><p>3. Strategy: Economic Pillar </p><p> </p><p>Jordan\'s efforts in confronting myriad problems hampering </p><p>economic growth and long-term prosperity are unique in the </p><p>region.  Our support of Jordan\'s efforts seeks to strengthen </p><p>Jordan as a stable partner within the MEFTA.  The ESF-funded </p><p>USAID program targets building economic opportunities, </p><p>health, population and education programs, and water </p><p>management aimed at bridging the hope gap and improving the </p><p>lives of the ordinary citizens, especially the youth.  An </p><p>OES-supported regional environmental hub officer is based in </p><p>Amman.  The above activities are underpinned by our ongoing </p><p>support for and encouragement of a sound, private sector </p><p>oriented economic policy framework that is conducive to </p><p>increased trade and investment flows between Jordan and the </p><p>rest of the world.  This effort pays special attention to </p><p>encouraging greater transparency in government and private </p><p>sector exchanges, including under the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade </p><p>Agreement and through Jordan\'s accession to the WTO\'s </p><p>Government Procurement Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>4.

Expected results and timeline </p><p> </p><p>     a) Trade and Investment promotion </p><p> </p><p>     2003:  US-Jordan bilateral trade equals $900 million </p><p>     2004:  US-Jordan bilateral trade equals $1.2 billion </p><p>     2005:  US-Jordan bilateral trade equals $1.3 billion </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     b) Health and Environment </p><p> </p><p>     2003:  Environment ministry formed; first meeting of </p><p>     Joint Environmental Forum held. </p><p> </p><p>     2004:  FDA formed and staffed, training of inspectors </p><p>     begins. </p><p> </p><p>     2005:  Jordanian food and pharmaceutical products </p><p>     cleared by Jordanian and U.S. FDA for export into US </p><p>     market at commercially significant levels. </p><p>     c) Economic policy framework support </p><p> </p><p>     2003:  Private sector complaints about contracting </p><p>     transparency decrease. </p><p> </p><p>     2004:  Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement signed </p><p>     between Jordan and U.S.; IPR infringement cases are </p><p>     brought before commercial courts, with commercially </p><p>     significant damages awarded in appropriate cases. Our </p><p>     major programs on population, health and water </p><p>     management, as well as our region-wide environment </p><p>     program, also look to our longer-term interests in a </p><p>     stable, prosperous Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>     2005:  Jordan accedes to WTO\'s Government Procurement </p><p>     Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>Political Reform Pillar (USAID) </p><p> </p><p>6.   Situation Analysis </p><p> </p><p>Regional tension and continuing economic distress have </p><p>presented the Government of Jordan (GOJ) with difficult </p><p>choices in balancing public order with open expression. </p><p>Jordan has a history as one of the more open political </p><p>systems in the region, but many critics have charged that </p><p>the government has backpedaled since the beginning of the </p><p>Palestinian Intifada in September 2000.  There are some </p><p>recent signs of greater liberalization, and we have </p><p>identified opportunities to strengthen democratic </p><p>institutions and attitudes.  In June 2003, for example, </p><p>Jordan held elections for the Lower House of the Parliament, </p><p>reserving six seats for female candidates.  While the </p><p>electoral process appeared to be clean and transparent, </p><p>critics complained that the legal basis for the elections </p><p>emphasized rural and tribal East Bank elements, which had </p><p>traditionally provided the strongest support for the </p><p>monarchy.  In addition, the King, the Justice and the </p><p>Planning Ministries, and other officials have indicated </p><p>under the Jordan First campaign that they seek more open and </p><p>participatory government through reforms, which will </p><p>reinforce its legitimacy. </p><p> </p><p>7.   Strategy </p><p> </p><p>The Mission\'s strategy aims to strengthen rule of law, </p><p>citizen awareness and activism through the legislative </p><p>branch, the courts and the public education system as well </p><p>as fledgling NGO and other community organizations.  Given </p><p>the political realities of Jordan, it will be necessary to </p><p>cooperate closely with the GOJ, or at least keep it informed </p><p>of activities that could involve its agencies, realizing at </p><p>the same time that democratic change can only come from an </p><p>enlightened and empowered Jordanian people.  Therefore we </p><p>must simultaneously support Jordanian efforts to reform </p><p>their official institutions while helping them raise the </p><p>awareness and participation of the people through NGOs </p><p>-especially women\'s and youth groups-- and other private, </p><p>civic organizations as well as the public and private </p><p>educational institutions.   We will also support Jordanian </p><p>efforts to strengthen the newly elected Parliament, the </p><p>courts and the regulatory agencies and to raise the accuracy </p><p>and relevance of the news media while working to advance </p><p>journalistic freedom. </p><p> </p><p>8.

Situation </p><p> </p><p>Currently in Jordan, most teaching is done through rote </p><p>learning with the use of a broad exam in the final year of </p><p>secondary school for use in admission to post-secondary </p><p>school education.  While the literacy rate in Jordan is </p><p>among the highest in the region at 89 percent, the </p><p>educational system does not produce the type of skills and </p><p>attitudes required in the global market. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Strategy </p><p> </p><p>To address the most critical issues in education in Jordan, </p><p>USAID/Jordan, using bi-lateral ESF funding, will focus on </p><p>early childhood education and specifically the participation </p><p>of girls; development of an information and communication </p><p>technology education stream in secondary education, as well </p><p>as other school-to-work curricula; development of standards </p><p>and accreditation together with teacher training and </p><p>curriculum development; continuation and expansion of the </p><p>INJAZ program which raises business awareness among young </p><p>people; Junior Achievement-type activity; life skills </p><p>development for adolescents; and, civic participation. </p><p>USAID\'s assistance to the education sector will be part of a </p><p>multi-donor effort to support the Government of Jordan\'s </p><p>initiative to improve education throughout the country.  The </p><p>specific areas in which USAID will work have been selected </p><p>in coordination with the Government and other donors. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Specific Activities will be determined after USAID\'s </p><p>country strategy is approved by the Mission and </p><p>USAID/Washington. </p><p> </p><p>13.    The timeline for the new USAID/Jordan education </p><p>strategy will be 2004 - 2009. </p><p></p></div>
