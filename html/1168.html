<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001867 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PRM, DRL, INR, EUR/ERA, EUR/UBI, INR/I </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, SMIG, CVIS, PINR, ASEC, CH, NL, EUN, KPRD </p><p>SUBJECT:  DUTCH RESPOND TO UK ALIEN SMUGGLING TRAGEDY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. THE GON REACTED WITH BOTH WORDS AND ACTIONS TO THE JUNE </p><p>19 DISCOVERY IN THE UK OF 58 VICTIMS OF ALIEN SMUGGLING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. BECAUSE THE TRUCK IN WHICH THE VICTIMS WERE DISCOVERED IS </p><p>OF DUTCH REGISTRATION AND THE DRIVER IS DUTCH, THE GON </p><p>BECAME IMMEDIATELY INVOLVED.  IT HAS SINCE ARRESTED BOTH THE </p><p>DUTCH FATHER OF THE DRIVER AND THE DUTCH OWNER OF THE </p><p>COMPANY THAT OWNS THE TRUCK.  FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS BY THE </p><p>GON INTO THE DUTCH CONNECTION TO THE TRAGEDY ARE ONGOING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. PM WIM KOK DESCRIBED THE DEATHS AS DEEPLY TRAGIC AND </p><p>IMMEDIATELY CALLED FOR STRONGER PUNISHMENTS FOR ALIEN </p><p>SMUGGLERS.  SINCE 1996, THE MAXIMUM PENALTY FOR ORGANIZED </p><p>ALIEN SMUGGLING HAS BEEN 8 YEARS IN PRISON.  STATE SECRETARY </p><p>COHEN OF THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, HOWEVER, CALLED FOR CLOSER </p><p>POLICE COOPERATION IN EUROPE TO COMBAT SMUGGLING RATHER THAN </p><p>STRONGER PENALTIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. DESPITE DUTCH EMPHASIS ON PUNISHING THOSE ARRESTED, THOSE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE MIGHT NOT BE PROSECUTABLE UNDER DUTCH LAW. </p><p>ALIEN SMUGGLING IS ONLY ILLEGAL IN THE NETHERLANDS IF THE </p><p>ACT OCCURRED IN THE NETHERLANDS OR THE PERSONS HAD BEEN </p><p>TRANSPORTED TO ANOTHER SIGNATORY COUNTRY OF THE SCHENGEN </p><p>TREATY.  BECAUSE THE UK IS NOT A SIGNATORY COUNTRY AND THERE </p><p>IS NOT YET PROOF THAT ANY ACT TOOK PLACE WITHIN THE </p><p>BOUNDARIES OF THE NETHERLANDS, PROSECUTION MIGHT NOT BE </p><p>POSSIBLE HERE DESPITE THE INVOLVEMENT OF DUTCH NATIONALS, A </p><p>DUTCH VEHICLE, AND A DUTCH COMPANY.  JUSTICE MINISTER </p><p>KORTHALS, HOWEVER, BELIEVES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PROSECUTE </p><p>ALIEN SMUGGLERS UNDER DUTCH LAW FOR ACTS OF SMUGGLING </p><p>COMMITTED OUTSIDE THE NETHERLANDS IN CASES WHERE THE CRIME </p><p>IS ACTUALLY ORGANIZED AND PLANNED IN THE NETHERLANDS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. ALIEN SMUGGLING CONTINUES TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS, AND COMBATING ALIEN SMUGGLING IS A HIGH </p><p>PRIORITY OF THE GON.  IN 1993, ALIEN SMUGGLING FIRST BECAME </p><p>A CRIME.  IN 1998, THE GON SET UP A SPECIALIZED TASK FORCE </p><p>TO COMBAT ALIEN SMUGGLING.  AS A RESULT, THE NUMBER OF </p><p>PERSONS CONVICTED FOR ALIEN SMUGGLING HAS INCREASED SIX FOLD </p><p>FROM 16 TO 102 SINCE 1995.  IN 1999 THERE WERE 221 ALIEN </p><p>SMUGGLING INVESTIGATIONS COMPARED TO 4 IN 1994. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
