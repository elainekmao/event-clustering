<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000818 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, EUR/SE, AND PM/LEGAL (CMDR MITCHELL); OSD FOR </p><p>ISP CAPT. WILKINS; JCS FOR J3, J5 AND CJCS DEPUTY LEGAL </p><p>COUNSEL CMDR BOOCK; EUCOM FOR J3, J4, J5, POLAD AND LEGAL; </p><p>CENTCOM FOR J3, J5 AND POLAD; TREASURY FOR LOEVINGER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ, EFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: MOU NEGOTIATING TEAM NEEDS TO BE READY START </p><p>TALKS IN ANKARA ON FEB 3 </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 788 (NODIS) B) ANKARA 673 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(u) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 2. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>SUMMARY/ACTION REQUEST </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Agreement with Turkey on a memorandum of understanding </p><p>(MOU) on US activities related to a possible Iraq operation </p><p>may be the long pole in the tent of our struggle to secure </p><p>full Turkish cooperation.  Both TGS and the MFA say an MOU is </p><p>a prerequisite for seeking parliamentary approval for site </p><p>preparations and inflow of forces.  The Turks will make this </p><p>negotiation only as urgently as we do.  They have said they </p><p>will mirror our team in composition and level.  Embassy </p><p>therefore strongly recommends that Washington dispatch an </p><p>Assistant Secretary-led team to Ankara to begin negotiations </p><p>with the Turks.  MFA Deputy U/S Ilkin told the Ambassador </p><p>during his January 30 meeting with the PM (ref a) that the </p><p>GOT intended to provide the USG its version of the MOU on </p><p>February 3.  TGS Deputy J5 for Agreements Maj. Gen. Acar </p><p>subsequently told ODC January 31 that the PM had approved </p><p>Turkey\'s draft MOU and the PM had authorized GOT officials to </p><p>begin negotiations with the US on Monday, February 3. </p><p>Therefore, our team needs to be ready to negotiate here in </p><p>Ankara by Monday morning.  The USG team should be authorized </p><p>maximum flexibility on the key issues (i.e. jurisdiction and </p><p>liability), and prepared to remain in Ankara as long as it </p><p>takes to reach an agreement with the GOT.  We also ask that </p><p>the Department provide us via front-channel the official US </p><p>delegation list, including the head of delegation.  End </p><p>summary/action request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>MOU STATE OF PLAY:  TURKS READY TO NEGOTIATE </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) During the Ambassador\'s January 30 meeting with Prime </p><p>Minister Gul (ref a), MFA Deputy U/S Ilkin said the MFA hoped </p><p>to be able to "finalize" its review of the MOU on January 31 </p><p>and be prepared to present its inter-agency approved views on </p><p>the MOU to the USG on February 3.  TGS Deputy J5 for </p><p>Agreements Maj. Gen. Acar subsequently told the Office of </p><p>Defense Cooperation (ODC) Turkey that the Prime Minister had </p><p>approved Turkey\'s proposed MOU and the PM authorized the GOT </p><p>to begin negotiations with the US on Monday, February 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>FEB 3: USG NEGOTIATIONS TEAM NEEDS TO BE IN ANKARA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) We understand that Washington currently is considering </p><p>having the negotiating team depart Washington Tuesday, </p><p>February 4.  This is too late.  We need to begin face-to-face </p><p>discussions with the GOT Monday, February 3.  If the team </p><p>departs on February 4, negotiations will not commence until </p><p>February 5 in the evening at the earliest.  Only two working </p><p>days would remain before the weekend and the week-long local </p><p>Turkish holiday beginning February 10.  To give the teams the </p><p>time they may need to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement </p><p>and put maximum pressure on the Turks, the US negotiating </p><p>team needs to be prepared to begin face-to-face negotiations </p><p>with the Turks on Monday, February 3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>TEAM COMPOSITION, FLEXIBILITY AND AUTHORITY KEY TO SUCCESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Based on our experience negotiating with the Turks </p><p>(including the recent negotiations over the site survey MOU </p><p>negotiations), we strongly believe that the USG negotiating </p><p>team needs to be headed at the Assistant Secretary level and </p><p>contain the necessary supporting civilian and military </p><p>technical experts to close the deal in-country.  The Mission </p><p>does not possess the resources or the expertise to negotiate </p><p>the MOU, and we believe that the USG delegation must be </p><p>headed by a senior policy civilian from Washington in order </p><p>to achieve success.  From the Turkish perspective, the higher </p><p>the level of the USG delegation chairperson, the more serious </p><p>they perceive the USG is about the negotiations.  Deputy U/S </p><p>Ilkin asked the Ambassador January 30 for the USG to provide </p><p>an official delegation list ASAP, saying the Turks would put </p><p>together a team of equal rank and composition.  An Assistant </p><p>Secretary-level chairperson from State or DOD should be </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>considered, but there is a risk to a DOD-lead: the Turks may </p><p>counter with a delegation led by an individual from a similar </p><p>but less influential organization (i.e. the Ministry of </p><p>National Defense, whose responsibilities encompass defense </p><p>procurement more than policy).  We understand the Turks </p><p>intend to include discussions of financial compensation </p><p>(including possibly the assistance package).  We believe the </p><p>USG team needs to be instructed to deal with that question. </p><p>We expect that such instruction would be to keep these issues </p><p>on the existing separate tracks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Given our experience in negotiating the site survey </p><p>MOU, we believe that the team needs to come to Ankara with </p><p>the maximum flexibility possible on the key issues of </p><p>jurisdiction and financial liability/compensation in order to </p><p>have a chance at concluding an mutually satisfactory </p><p>agreement in a reasonable period. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
