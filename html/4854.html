<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 003372 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 12/23/07 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, SOCI, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DECEMBER POLITICAL UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE TIM ANDREWS. REASONS 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This periodic update for political events in </p><p>Nigeria includes items of interest from recent weeks. </p><p>Topics covered in this edition include: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- INEC: 30 Political Associations for Registration </p><p>-- Cabinet Shake-Up </p><p>-- Rimi and Others Sue the PDP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>OPENING THE POLITICAL SPACE: 30 NEW POLTIICAL PARTIES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Pursuant to the Supreme Court decision that </p><p>previous guidelines for registering political parties </p><p>were unconstitutional and too stringent, the </p><p>Independent National Election Commission (INEC) </p><p>begrudgingly registered 24 new parties in December. </p><p>The new parties are: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>National Conscience Party (NCP), </p><p>People\'s Redemption Party (PRP), </p><p>Movement for Democracy and Justice (MDJ), </p><p>National Reformation Party (NRP), </p><p>All Peoples Liberation Party (APLP), </p><p>Better Nigeria Progressive Party (BNPP), </p><p>Community Party of Nigeria (CPN), </p><p>Democratic Alternative (DA), </p><p>Justice Party (JP), </p><p>Liberal Democratic Party of Nigeria (LDPN), </p><p>Masses Movement of Nigeria (MMN), </p><p>National Action Council (NAC), </p><p>National Mass Movement of Nigeria (NMMN), </p><p>New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), </p><p>New Democrats (ND), </p><p>Nigeria Advance Party (NAP), </p><p>Nigerian Peoples Congress (NPC), </p><p>Party for Social Democracy (PSD), </p><p>Peoples Mandate Party (PMP), </p><p>Peoples Salvation Party (PSP), </p><p>Progressive Action Congress (PAC), </p><p>Action Renaissance Party (ARP), </p><p>United Democratic Party (UDP), and </p><p>Green Party of Nigeria (GPN). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Many of these parties are insignificant and </p><p>barely exist outside the imagination of their </p><p>founders.  However, some are headed by respected </p><p>politicians such as former Kaduna Governor Balarabe </p><p>Musa (PRP), former Police Inspector M. D. Yusufu </p><p>(MDJ), human rights firebrand Gani Fawahenmi (NCP), </p><p>and perennial presidential contestant Tunji </p><p>Braithwaite (NAP).  Well-known human rights attorney </p><p>Olisa Agbakoba, a long-shot presidential candidate in </p><p>the PDP, jumped to the Green Party when it was allowed </p><p>to register.  None of these parties have a chance of </p><p>capturing the Presidency, and few have any chance of </p><p>winning many seats in State Assemblies, to say nothing </p><p>of the National Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) However, the inclusion of these parties </p><p>represents an opening of the political space. For many </p><p>Nigerians the new parties symbolize a possible </p><p>alternative to the monetized politics of the major </p><p>parties. Now less-affluent but more ideologically </p><p>oriented politicians can head parties and use these </p><p>parties as their platforms to address the public. Some </p><p>of these players and their parties have committed </p><p>pockets of followers, albeit relatively small, in key </p><p>areas. They might affect numerous local government </p><p>races and perhaps have limited impact in some state </p><p>level races. Most of these parties are Southern-based. </p><p>The five to seven best-organized new parties are </p><p>discussing an electoral alliance under the rubric of </p><p>the Coalition of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The danger always exists that proliferation of </p><p>parties will confuse the electorate or encourage </p><p>ethnic or regional politics. This was the rationale </p><p>used in the recent past to thwart registration of </p><p>these parties. However, most Nigerians welcomed the </p><p>registration of the parties. They see it as a vehicle </p><p>to improve grassroots participation. The advent of </p><p>these parties should engender a greater sense of </p><p>freedom of association and foster the perception that </p><p>politics need not be the exclusive reserve of the </p><p>wealthy. Additionally, pressure from the new parties </p><p>might help make INEC more transparent in its electoral </p><p>preparations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Cynical observers claim registration of the new </p><p>parties was not based on principle but expediency. </p><p>They contend the Presidency and PDP wanted to increase </p><p>the number of parties to fragment and dilute the </p><p>opposition. This argument has some merit and cannot be </p><p>completely ignored. Conventional wisdom within the PDP </p><p>is that the increase in parties favors them. However, </p><p>the PDP gaining advantage from this is not entirely </p><p>certain. Much will depend on the candidates these </p><p>parties may present and how they match up with PDP </p><p>candidates as well as the candidates from the other </p><p>previously registered parties, particularly the main </p><p>opposition party, the ANPP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>CABINET SHAKE-UP </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) President Obasanjo and the Federal Executive </p><p>Council (FEC) named new ministers to replace those who </p><p>resigned to participate in the upcoming elections. </p><p>Controversial Minister of Works and Housing Chief Tony </p><p>Anenih resigned to concentrate on his responsibilities </p><p>as Deputy National Coordinator of the Obasanjo/Atiku </p><p>reelection campaign. Minister of State Garba Madaki </p><p>replaces Anenih at the helm of Works and Housing. </p><p>Anenih\'s removal was one of the conditions Vice </p><p>President Atiku and former Head of State Babangida had </p><p>given to Obasanjo for supporting his reelection. While </p><p>intervening events make Babangida\'s support unlikely, </p><p>Anenih\'s resignation probably has made Atiku more </p><p>comfortable about remaining on the Obasanjo ticket. </p><p>Clearly there was no love lost between Atiku and </p><p>Anenih. That Anenih now serves directly under Atiku, </p><p>the de facto campaign manager, compounds the former </p><p>minister\'s diminution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Internal Affairs Minister Sunday Afolabi also </p><p>quit to join the reelection campaign. Minister of </p><p>State Mohammed Shata replaced him. (Afolabi is from </p><p>the Southwest and is expected to work on assuring </p><p>Obasanjo\'s base among the Yorubas.)  Minister of Power </p><p>and Steel Dr. Segun Agagu resigned to run for governor </p><p>in Ondo State. His replacement is a fellow Yoruba, Olu </p><p>Agunloye.  Minister of Commerce Alhaji Mustapha Bello </p><p>will contest the gubernatorial election in Niger </p><p>State. Bellow was replaced by Minister of State for </p><p>Water Resources, Precious Ngele. Current Niger State </p><p>Governor Kure, although in the PDP, is a Babangida </p><p>acolyte.  There was speculation that the contest </p><p>between Kure and Bello could turn into a proxy war for </p><p>Babangida and Obasanjo. However, true to the policy of </p><p>supporting incumbent PDP governors, public statements </p><p>from the Presidency have been supportive of Kure and </p><p>silent about Bello.  Meanwhile, Minister of Finance </p><p>Adamu Ciroma retains his portfolio despite his nominal </p><p>duties as the Obasanjo/Atiku campaign national </p><p>coordinator. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>RIMI SUES THE PDP </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Former Kano State Governor and long-shot PDP </p><p>presidential aspirant Abubakar Rimi has lodged two </p><p>legal complaints against his party. Joined by fellow </p><p>long-shot candidate Barnabas Gemade, Rimi complains </p><p>that the decision to zone the presidency to the South </p><p>contravened the party constitution. PDP Chairman Audu </p><p>Ogbeh, however, might have taken some of the wind from </p><p>this complaint by explaining that the decision to zone </p><p>the presidency to the three Southern political zones </p><p>was not final until approved by the party\'s National </p><p>Executive Committee. (Both Rimi and Gemade would be </p><p>eliminated if the presidency were zoned to the South. </p><p>Likewise, VP Atiku would be foreclosed as well. </p><p>Obasanjo and his most potent primary opposition, Alex </p><p>Ekwueme are both Southerners.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Rimi\'s suit contesting the allocation of </p><p>voting delegates to the national convention is perhaps </p><p>even more important. This suit seeks to overturn a </p><p>2001 amendment to the PDP constitution. The amendment </p><p>makes most classes of presidential appointees </p><p>(presidential advisors, ambassadors, heads of </p><p>parastatals, etc.) voting delegates at the national </p><p>convention that will select the party\'s presidential </p><p>candidate. Given the swollen number of advisors and </p><p>others appointees, this amendments provides Obasanjo </p><p>the very significant lead in recapturing the </p><p>nomination. (Comment: While motivated by selfish </p><p>reasons, Rimi\'s suits, if successful, would inject </p><p>greater openness into the PDP\'s presidential selection </p><p>process. Rimi\'s suits are not logically consistent. On </p><p>one hand, he grouses that zoning contravenes the party </p><p>constitution. In the second suit, be asserts that the </p><p>party constitution is wrong. The possibility of </p><p>winning either argument is uncertain but chances are </p><p>the courts will not let Rimi have it both ways. End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The party constitution also gives similar </p><p>favor to state governors.  Due to this provision and </p><p>other alleged irregularities, a group of non-incumbent </p><p>gubernatorial contestants in the PDP successfully won </p><p>a temporary injunction in early December stopping the </p><p>party\'s gubernatorial primaries. However, the Chief </p><p>Justice of the Federal High Court in Abuja reportedly </p><p>quashed the injunction on December 20, giving the PDP </p><p>a green light to conduct the gubernatorial caucuses. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
