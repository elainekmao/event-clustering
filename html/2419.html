<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000236 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR DS/DSS/ITA, DS/OP/AF, DS/PSP/FPD, AF/EX, AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, CASC, AMGT, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN ABUJA\'S MAIN MARKETPLACE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. A violent disturbance erupted this morning in </p><p>Abuja\'s Wuse New Market between vendors and Nigerian </p><p>National Police when the police attempted to dismantle </p><p>the numerous illegal shops and residences in the busy, </p><p>market area. As the police began their sweep, affected </p><p>vendors and residential squatters responded in protest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The protest quickly degenerated into rock and bottle </p><p>throwing. The confrontation spilled from the </p><p>marketplace into sections of several main thoroughfares </p><p>of the city, choking off traffic on some important </p><p>arteries in the area near the market.  Several parked </p><p>cars were set ablaze and passing vehicles and motorists </p><p>were pelted with stones and bottles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. One policeman was reportedly killed during the </p><p>melee.  As the violence escalated, the Police called in </p><p>reinforcements and they have been using tear gas and </p><p>gunfire to disperse the crowds and quell the </p><p>demonstration. We have no information about any </p><p>civilian casualties nor about the number of police </p><p>actually deployed.  It does not appear that any army </p><p>units have been called to assist. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. There are no reports of American citizens being </p><p>caught in the market upheaval.  The Embassy has </p><p>directed all employees and family members to avoid the </p><p>area until after the weekend.  A similar warden message </p><p>was issued this afternoon. (Para 6.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Post management will continue to monitor the </p><p>situation to determine if additional precautions are </p><p>warranted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Text of Embassy Warden Message: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>   "A serious disturbance occurred in the Wuse New </p><p>Market area this morning (January 25). The disturbance </p><p>later intensified and spread to Berger Junction. There </p><p>have been reports of gunshots and burning vehicles.  We </p><p>have one confirmed report that a police officer was </p><p>killed in the disturbance.  We urge all American </p><p>citizens to avoid the area from Wuse Market to Berger </p><p>Junction at least until the weekend.  Even after the </p><p>violence has ended, the area will be unsettled and </p><p>should be avoided as previously stated.  Please </p><p>exercise particular caution throughout Abuja this </p><p>weekend." </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
