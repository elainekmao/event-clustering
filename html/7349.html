<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 002344 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR OES/ETC, OES/PCI, EUR/SE </p><p>PLEASE PASS EPA/OIA (HHUYNH) </p><p>POSTS FOR ESTOFFICERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, GG, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  TURKEY MAKES GOOD PROGRESS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES </p><p>ON WETLANDS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary. With 71 wetlands of "international importance," </p><p>175 lowland wetlands and 1,000 alpine wetlands, Turkey hosts </p><p>one of the most significant collections of wetlands in </p><p>Europe and the Middle East.  The development of its first </p><p>five-year national plan and the implementation of its first </p><p>wetlands regulation represent recent impressive progress in </p><p>Turkey\'s wetlands management.  GOT also established a </p><p>national commission and blocked several projects that would </p><p>have negatively affected its wetlands. But the missing </p><p>elements are huge -- private sector involvement and </p><p>sufficient funding to implement plans. End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Four Milestones in Wetlands Management </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  Turkey become a party to the "Convention on Wetlands of </p><p>International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat" in </p><p>1994 and has made impressive progress in the past 15 months, </p><p>achieving four important milestones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (1) Turkey has completed its first National Wetlands </p><p>Strategy Plan, covering 2003-08.  Developed in cooperation </p><p>with four ministries (Environment, Forestry, Culture, </p><p>Agriculture), the State Water Works (DSI), and NGOs </p><p>(WWF/Turkey, Bird Researches Association), the strategy won </p><p>praise from the Ramsar Secretariat for its emphasis on </p><p>interagency cooperation and for being one of the first </p><p>national strategic policy documents focused strictly on </p><p>wetlands.  Actively engaged in plan development, WWF/Turkey </p><p>finds the plan quite fair in assigning responsibilities </p><p>among stakeholders and in setting realistic and supportable </p><p>objectives.  (Comment. The plan\'s principle drawback is that </p><p>it continues the practice of precluding the private sector </p><p>from participating in developing wetlands management plans. </p><p>End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (2) Effective January 2002, Turkey enacted Wetlands </p><p>Protection Regulation that set out guidelines for wetlands </p><p>protection and use.  What is most remarkable is that Turkey </p><p>has stopped several projects proposed by powerful ministries </p><p>(DSI, Agriculture) that would have harmed protected </p><p>wetlands. Among the blocked projects are the drainage of </p><p>12,000 hectares (ha) in Kizilirmak River basin near Samsun, </p><p>the irrigation of 48,000 ha in Beysehir Lake (Konya and </p><p>Isparta), and the construction of an international harbor in </p><p>Izmir\'s Gediz Delta.  Other projects have been sent back to </p><p>the drawing board, including a DSI project that would have </p><p>negatively affected the ecological integrity of Lake Seyfe </p><p>near Kirsehir, water flow plans for the Sultan Marshes in </p><p>Kayseri, and water plans for Lake Kus near Balikesir. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (3) Turkey established a 12-member National Wetlands </p><p>Commission, as required in its wetlands regulations.  MOE </p><p>heads the Commission whose members include the general </p><p>directors of government ministries, important NGOs and </p><p>academics. MOE believes that such a high level commission </p><p>will resolve conflicting interests among concerned </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (4) Turkey has designated 71 of its wetlands as </p><p>"internationally important" following Ramsar criteria for </p><p>fish and waterfowl.  These designations bolster recognition </p><p>of Turkey as host to one of the most significant collections </p><p>of wetlands in Europe and the Middle East.  In addition, </p><p>Turkey has nine designated Ramsar sites ("Ramsar </p><p>designations" are awarded to those sites with </p><p>internationally significant ecology, botany, zoology, </p><p>limnology or hydrology.) Fulfilling the requirements of its </p><p>wetlands regulations, GOT has identified protection areas </p><p>and buffer zones for many of the country\'s 250 lowland and </p><p>more than 1,000 alpine wetlands, many of which are barely </p><p>even mapped. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ramsar to Open Regional Center in Turkey </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>3.  WWF told us that the Ramsar Secretariat described </p><p>Turkey\'s regulations and its strategic plan as "models" for </p><p>other countries because they add management techniques </p><p>unique to Turkey to Ramsar\'s recommended global management </p><p>system.  Turkey will host the important international </p><p>Mediterranean Wetlands Initiative meeting in Izmir in June. </p><p>Following the meeting, MOE and Ramsar Secretariat will open </p><p>a Regional Ramsar Center to serve Turkey, the Caucasus and </p><p>Central Asian Countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s Wetlands Players </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>4.  In addition to the National Wetlands Commission, three </p><p>institutions are actively engaged in Turkey\'s wetlands </p><p>issues. </p><p>-- (1) MOE.  Through its Directorate General for </p><p>Environmental Protection, the MOE is Turkey\'s designated </p><p>Ramsar authority. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (2) NGOs.  NGOs, such as WWF, have taken the lead in </p><p>encouraging local communities to use wetlands wisely, a </p><p>particularly welcomed educational function that complements </p><p>a GOT-produced wetlands documentary. (Comment. Turkey\'s </p><p>engaging NGOs in wetlands activities is not surprising. It </p><p>follows Turkey\'s recognition for its "Worldwide Best </p><p>Practice" for effectively engaging civil society </p><p>institutions in the development of its WSSD report. End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- (3) DSI.  As the agency responsible for water supply and </p><p>distribution, DSI is clearly the most influential water </p><p>agency in Turkey.  DSI pressed to be the deciding voice in </p><p>wetlands planning during the early stages of the </p><p>regulation\'s implementation, despite MOE\'s official Ramsar </p><p>designation and GOT\'s own requirement that wetlands </p><p>regulations be prepared in coordination among ministries, </p><p>local authorities and others. However, the National Wetlands </p><p>Commission succeeded in deflecting the potential imbalance </p><p>of power. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wetlands: Their Threats and Resources </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>5.  The primary threat to wetlands in general is potential </p><p>destruction of delicate hydrologic balance.  The greatest </p><p>potential offenders are water suppliers and users.  In </p><p>Turkey, these are potentially DSI, the Ministry of Rural </p><p>Affairs, municipalities, local water users associations </p><p>(irrigation), and water companies.  Pollution (domestic, </p><p>industrial, agricultural) and habitat destruction are other </p><p>destructive influences.  Anthropogenic activity, another </p><p>threat, has all but destroyed the alpine wetlands in parts </p><p>of eastern Anatolia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Even with hundreds of wetlands in its territory, the GOT </p><p>has only three wetlands management plans (Goksu Delta, </p><p>Manyas Lake, Uluabat Lake) in effect.  The MOE aims to </p><p>develop and implement two to three additional wetlands plans </p><p>per year.  However, as a non-implementing agency, the MOE </p><p>has no funding for this purpose and instead relies entirely </p><p>on outside sources to fund the $65 - 75,000 it typically </p><p>costs to develop wetlands plans over the course of two </p><p>years. France and the Netherlands are currently partially </p><p>funding two new wetlands plans (Gediz Delta, Burdur Lake). </p><p>Implementation can be hugely costly as well, addressing </p><p>biology, sociology, biodiversity and other wetlands </p><p>elements. Turkey has identified future priorities -- </p><p>Kizilirmak Delta, Seyfe Lake, Sultan Marshes, Hazar Lake and </p><p>the Meric Delta -- but has not earmarked funding to address </p><p>their needs.  In addition to an absence of funding, </p><p>expertise within the MOE is limited. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Transboundary Projects on the Horizon </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>7.  Turkey has several potential opportunities for cross- </p><p>border cooperation: with Georgia (at Aktas Lake), Armenia (a </p><p>mountain wetlands), and Greece (the Meric Delta, a Ramsar </p><p>site on the Greek side of the border).  WWF/Georgia is </p><p>working on an eco-regional, transboundary conservation </p><p>project involving Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia and </p><p>Iran.  Although a transboundary Ramsar designation could be </p><p>achieved within five years, it is unclear if Turkey has </p><p>implemented the legal requirements to support transboundary </p><p>protection.  However, the plan proposes adding a </p><p>transboundary Ramsar site and a cooperative transboundary </p><p>management program to wetlands programming.  It is projected </p><p>that the transboundary site to be selected will be one </p><p>shared with Georgia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>8. Effective wetlands management requires a high level, long- </p><p>term commitment. The on-again, off-again merger of </p><p>ministries of Environment and Forestry has reduced momentum </p><p>somewhat on wetlands development but not deterred the MOE </p><p>team from pushing forward.  Although its first transboundary </p><p>wetlands management proposal is in the pipeline, Turkey </p><p>still lacks sufficient funding and technical resources to </p><p>implement its domestic programs.  The opening of a Regional </p><p>Ramsar Center later this year and Turkey\'s hosting a </p><p>regional wetlands conference may bring much needed exposure, </p><p>expertise and resources to Turkey\'s rich wetlands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
