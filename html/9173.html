PALMER FOR REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Summary and Action Request </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) For its entire year and a half in office, the Maduro </p><p>administration has struggled to reach agreement with the </p><p>IMF on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) </p><p>program that will put Honduras back on a growth track and </p><p>allow badly-needed permanent debt relief to resume.   With </p><p>the April adoption of a second tax package that should </p><p>increase tax receipts by USD 300 million annually, the GOH </p><p>made a major step toward an IMF agreement.  World Bank and </p><p>IDB approval of projects to strengthen the Honduran banking </p><p>system is another important milestone.  In the context of </p><p>work on the banking sector, the GOH has issued a long </p><p>analytical report on the new agricultural credit program </p><p>laying out a persuasive case that the law limits and </p><p>rationalizes (rather than expands) subsidies provided for </p><p>agricultural financing.  The most important requirement now </p><p>for an IMF program is enactment of a Civil Service </p><p>Framework Law that will put a brake on the unsustainable </p><p>growth in the central government\'s wage bill.  The IMF </p><p> </p><p>is urging measures that, as part of the creation of a </p><p>professional civil service, would fold in the public sector </p><p>teachers and medical workers into a single civil service </p><p>pay structure.   However, President Ricardo Maduro and his </p><p>top political advisors fear that change to the special </p><p>statutes governing teacher and doctor compensation will </p><p>provoke a strong, adverse political reaction; the President </p><p>has not yet approved the submission of the bill to Congress </p><p>(where it would indeed face a stiff fight).  In the </p><p>meantime, Honduras\' failure to reach an IMF agreement has </p><p>ended the technical deferral of Paris Club debt service </p><p>payments, once again putting overdue loan payments to the </p><p>U.S. into active status.  In late June, ExIm Bank took </p><p>Honduras off-cover for public sector loans.  Lack of </p><p>payment on overdue U.S. Department of Defense Loans in mid </p><p>July and early September could trigger Brooke Amendment </p><p>sanctions.  However, the GOH is not at liberty to pay only </p><p>one official creditor under Paris Club rules. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Action Request: Maduro badly needs reassurance that </p><p>(1) the civil service reforms (and the ensuing political </p><p>fight) are indispensable, (2) the international community </p><p>will support him if he does take this move, and (3) that an </p><p>IMF agreement would likely be forthcoming quickly after </p><p>passage of the law even if all IMF targets for reduction of </p><p>the public sector wage bill are not completely met.  Given </p><p>the importance of reaching an IMF agreement this summer, </p><p>the critical nature of this long-awaited structural reform </p><p>and the advances made in other areas, Post recommends a </p><p>full court press by the Embassy and Washington agencies to </p><p>provide this reassurance and urge that the Civil Service </p><p>Framework Law (and the related elimination of the </p><p>compensation provisions in the teachers and medical workers </p><p>laws) be introduced to Congress immediately.  End Summary </p><p>and Action Request. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>Projections Show that Second Tax Bill Will Deliver Promised </p><p>Revenue Increases </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As reported in ref A, on April 2, the Honduran </p><p>Congress adopted a second fiscal package (the first was </p><p>adopted in May 2002) designed to broaden the tax base, help </p><p>reduce chronic budget deficits and move the government on </p><p>the road to an IMF agreement.  Congress modified some </p><p>politically difficult provisions in the government-proposal </p><p>but increased taxes on tobacco and alcohol in order to </p><p>replace the foregone income.  The target had been an annual </p><p>increase of 3.5 billion lempiras (USD 202 million) - of </p><p>which about 2 billion lempiras (USD 116 million) would be </p><p>collected in the remaining months of 2003, but at the time </p><p>of passage IMF staff were skeptical that these targets </p><p>would be met by the revised bill. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Current GOH projections show that in fact the second </p><p>tax bill should almost exactly meet its targets.  Tax </p><p>revenue in 2003 is projected to rise from the baseline </p><p>level of USD 1.1 billion (16. 0 percent of GDP) to the </p><p>current 2003 projection of USD 1.23 billion  (17.5 percent </p><p>of GDP) and then to USD 1.43 billion in 2004 (18.6 percent </p><p>of GDP). </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Combined with earlier austerity measures taken in </p><p>2002 and 2003, the tax reforms should bring the central </p><p>government\'s fiscal deficit down from 5.6 percent in 2002 </p><p>to an estimated 3.5 percent of GDP in 2003, as predicted. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p>Civil Service Law and Modification of Estatutos Still Key </p><p>Sticking Point </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The most problematic issue remains: getting public </p><p>sector wages under control.  The IMF mission has emphasized </p><p>repeatedly the importance of enactment of a new civil </p><p>service framework law that will provide the GOH with </p><p>control over wage policy for all central government workers </p><p>by superseding the salary provisions in the </p><p>profession-specific laws (called estatutos) that were </p><p>adopted in the mid-1980s.  The Fund has also urged the GOH </p><p>to reduce the central government wage bill from 10.7 </p><p>percent to 10.1 percent of GDP in 2003 and reduce the wage </p><p>bill of the entire public sector by one percent of GDP </p><p>annually in 2004 and 2005. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Enactment of civil service reform was a key </p><p>(unfulfilled) condition in the previous three-year PRGF </p><p>agreement with the IMF, and has taken center stage in the </p><p>negotiations that have been going on between the Fund and </p><p>the GOH since early 2002.   Under the current regime, </p><p>doctors and teachers have received high salary increases </p><p>each year while non-unionized public sector workers have </p><p>seen their salaries frozen.  The salary provisions in the </p><p>teacher "estatuto" are particularly complex, with the </p><p>various provisions on salary and benefits resulting in </p><p>compensation increases at rates far above inflation.  This </p><p>issue took on added saliency in July 2002 when the GOH </p><p>reached an agreement with the majority of teachers to </p><p>provide a 44 percent salary increase over four years </p><p>(2002-2005), without affecting the concomitant increase in </p><p>the benefits (called colaterales).   Among other aspects </p><p>that rankled the IMF staff to no end, this agreement </p><p>provided the teachers with two separate wage increases in </p><p>2005. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) As seen in previous Embassy reporting, the Maduro </p><p>Administration has been promising to introduce the civil </p><p>service bill for many months, but kept breaking that </p><p>promise.  Behind the scenes, an intense debate was </p><p>occurring over the extent to which teacher, doctor and </p><p>nurse compensation would be covered by the new civil </p><p>service rules.  The GOH wanted to include only the basic </p><p>salary, while the IMF was adamant that all salary and </p><p>benefits provisions in the "estatutos" would need to be </p><p>eliminated if the law was to have its intended effect of </p><p>reining in the growth of the wage bill.  The Fund staff </p><p>also pushed for elimination of one of the scheduled teacher </p><p>raises in 2005.  At the same time, the GOH was negotiating </p><p>with the doctors to accept the revised pay structure. </p><p>Although doctor and nurse salaries comprise only a small </p><p>percentage of the government wage bill, their salary </p><p>demands are so obviously out of line with regional norms </p><p>that the GOH hoped they could be pressured (or shamed) into </p><p>an agreement.  This strategy was not successful and the GOH has </p><p>suspended negotiations for now. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Post understands that the IMF and the Finance </p><p>Ministry have now worked out language for the Civil Service </p><p>law that would eliminate all salary provisions in the </p><p>teacher and medical worker statutes except for the hardship </p><p>locality differential (called the zonaje) and the June and </p><p>Christmas bonuses.  Teachers would be covered by the new </p><p>law starting in June 2005 (allowing the government to avoid </p><p>that second pay increase for 2005).  The law would call for </p><p>establishment of civil service grades and pay scales within </p><p>six months of enactment of the law.  Those government </p><p>employees whose current salary exceeds the pay scale of </p><p>their new civil service grade would forego future raises </p><p>until such time as their salary was no longer above the </p><p>cap. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) This formulation for teacher compensation will be </p><p>politically difficult to sell, but at least allows the </p><p>government to avoid reducing any teacher salaries below </p><p>their current level (almost inconceivable in the Honduran </p><p>political climate).  The flip side is that maintenance of </p><p>current teacher salary levels means that the government </p><p>would have no room to provide any increases for other </p><p>government workers in 2004.  This could mean a third year </p><p>of a wage freeze for these other public sector workers, an </p><p>unpalatable but probably necessary result of the current </p><p>fiscal situation.  Low public sector salaries are one </p><p>important cause of corruption and incompetence in GOH </p><p>agencies. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>The Financial Sector and the Agricultural  Credits Law </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) In its Article IV review of Honduras, the IMF Board </p><p>noted the importance of addressing the extreme fragility of </p><p>the Honduran financial system.  In late June 2003, the </p><p>World Bank adopted an USD 11 million loan to address the </p><p>weaknesses identified in the recently concluded Financial </p><p>Sector review (FSAP).   Comment:  This push to analyze and </p><p>address the deep problems in the financial sector is a GOH </p><p>initiative (specifically by the current Banking and </p><p>Insurance Commission President Ana Cristina de Pereira). </p><p>It is a complicated task, and the difficulty of the task </p><p>should not be underestimated.  But, the Maduro </p><p>administration is making a far more serious attempt than </p><p>any previous Honduran government.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) The GOH appears to have been sincerely puzzled and </p><p>shocked by the controversy generated in the IMF and USG </p><p>over the adoption of Decree 68-2003, which consolidated the </p><p>agricultural loans, interest rate subsidies, amnesties and </p><p>other measures in three previous laws adopted by Congress </p><p>during 2000-2002.  The government believes that the new law </p><p>actually lowers the cost of its assistance to the </p><p>agriculture sector substantially and limits its exposure. </p><p>As previously promised, the Ministry of Finance and the </p><p>Banking and Insurance Commission have developed a 32-page </p><p>analysis of the four laws and their implications for </p><p>government finances.  During the week of June 23, this </p><p>analysis was sent to the IMF along with a computer disk </p><p>containing the names of all the beneficiaries.  A copy of </p><p>the paper, written in Spanish, is being faxed to State </p><p>(WHA/CEN/Brett Makens) and Treasury; a fuller summary will </p><p>be provided septel. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) The previous three laws, adopted starting in 2000, </p><p>were motivated by a wish to help farmers and the banks to </p><p>overcome the financial losses suffered during and in the </p><p>aftermath of Hurricane Mitch in late 1998 and the ensuing </p><p>stagnation in the sector.   According to the GOH report, </p><p>the measures provided interest rate subsidies for loans </p><p>totaling USD 252 million, loan forgiveness of USD 39.6 </p><p>million, financed by bonds, and commitments to extend these </p><p>benefits to an additional USD 83 million worth of loans. </p><p>The previous decrees also authorized automatic guarantees </p><p>for ag loans (50-70 percent) that represented an additional </p><p>contingent obligation for the government, estimated at USD </p><p>144.5 million. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Decree 68-2003 was developed to consolidate the </p><p>committed fiscal resources into one mechanism, in order to </p><p>rationalize the credit programs, avoid additional </p><p>contingent liabilities, relieve pressure on the banks with </p><p>large outstanding agricultural portfolios and encourage the </p><p>provision of new loans to the Honduran ag sector. </p><p>Delinquency in loan repayment and other high risk factors </p><p>have resulted in a rapid contraction of agricultural </p><p>lending by the Honduran financial system.  The GOH report </p><p>notes that new agriculture loans accounted for 8.3 percent </p><p>of bank lending in 1999 and only 4.1 percent in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) The IMF staff working on the Honduran program </p><p>reacted strongly and adversely in April to the news of </p><p>Decree 68-2003, terming it a new subsidy program that </p><p>benefited large, politically influential landowners that </p><p>would have an immediate negative impact on government </p><p>finances and the IMF program under negotiation.   The GOH </p><p>report is an attempt to demonstrate that this program is </p><p>not at all new and that the costs are actually lower than </p><p>would be the case under the previous system.  The </p><p>beneficiaries are limited to those individuals who already </p><p>were entitled under the previous three decrees.  Note: A </p><p>modification made by Congress in April to the bill would </p><p>have made the benefits available to additional (unlimited) </p><p>beneficiaries now and in the future; Econoffs heard in May </p><p>from members of the Bankers\' Association that this news was </p><p>resulting in widespread loan payment delinquency and new </p><p>requests for debt forgiveness.  The government subsequently </p><p>worked with the Congress to correct this issue in the final </p><p>version of the law, before it was signed by the President </p><p>and published.  End Note. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) The tables below provide the government\'s estimates </p><p>of the costs implicit in the earlier regime and the new </p><p>one.   The cash cost of the various agricultural credit </p><p>programs has been reduced slightly in nominal terms and </p><p>significantly in present value terms. </p><p> </p><p>Financial Costs of Previous </p><p>Scheme </p><p> </p><p>                       Nominal         Present Value </p><p>                     -----------     ----------------- </p><p>                    (USD million)      (USD million) </p><p> </p><p>Interest Subsidies         86                 65 </p><p>Interest on bonds          21                 13 </p><p>Transfers to BANADESA      33                 19 </p><p>Funding of FONGAC          28                 28 </p><p>Bond issue                 --                 17 </p><p>                       ------            ------- </p><p>                          168                142 </p><p> </p><p>Financial Costs of Current Scheme </p><p> </p><p>                       Nominal         Present Value </p><p>                     -----------     ----------------- </p><p>                    (USD million)      (USD million) </p><p> </p><p>Transfers to trust        98.0                 80.0 </p><p>Interest on bonds          9.6                  7.4 </p><p>Transfers to BANADESA     33.0                 19.6 </p><p>Funding of FONGAC         11.3                  -- </p><p>Subsidies already paid    11.0                  -- </p><p>                      --------             -------- </p><p>                         162.9                107.0 </p><p> </p><p>Note: The current exchange rate is 17.3 lempiras to the </p><p>dollar. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) Why wasn\'t there better consultation with the IMF </p><p>and USG?  The GOH explanation is that they did consult, but </p><p>they really didn\'t see it as a new program with new fiscal </p><p>costs.  The law was mentioned in passing by the Finance </p><p>Minister to IMF Mission chief and IMF permanent rep early </p><p>in the year.  Banking Commission President Ana Cristina </p><p>Pereira indicates she had discussed it with members of the </p><p>IMF-World Bank FSAP team, but the resident director of the </p><p>World Bank program is not aware of these discussions (the </p><p>FSAP included a large number of small teams working on </p><p>different aspects of the financial sector).  President </p><p>Maduro did not raise the issue during his meeting with US </p><p>Treasury Secretary Snow, probably for the same reasons.  In </p><p>response to complaints from Washington about the lack of </p><p>consultation, the GOH is now doing its best to put as much </p><p>information on the table as possible. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>The Implications for Debt Deferrals and Forgiveness </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C) In the meantime, Honduras\' failure to reach an IMF </p><p>agreement has ended the deferral of Paris Club debt service </p><p>payments, once again putting overdue loan payments to the </p><p>U.S. into active status.  In late June, ExIm Bank took </p><p>Honduras off-cover for public sector loans.  The Embassy </p><p>has informed the GOH that lack of payment on overdue </p><p>Department of Defense Loans -- USD 12,187 in mid July 2003 </p><p>and USD 1,762,150 in early September 2003 -- could trigger </p><p>Brooke Amendment sanctions.  Embassy also is exploring </p><p>whether other overdue loans could trigger 620Q sanctions. </p><p>The GOH is not at liberty to pay only one official creditor </p><p>under Paris Club rules.  According to the GOH\'s accounts, </p><p>outstanding debt service owed to the USG (Department of </p><p>Defense, Eximbank and AID) totals USD 17.7 million   Of </p><p>this amount, 8.1 million is over 6 months overdue and could </p><p>trigger Brooke or 620Q sanctions. </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Can the USG Help Push This to A Close? </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19. (C) In candid conversations with the Ambassador and </p><p>other USG officials, President Maduro and Minister of the </p><p>Presidency Luis Cosenza (and their political advisors) have </p><p>repeatedly emphasized (1) how difficult politically it </p><p>would be to change the teacher and medical worker statutes </p><p>and (2) how unfairly the IMF has treated the Maduro team, </p><p>when the very policies that have caused the underlying </p><p>fiscal problems were enacted by the two previous </p><p>administrations without protest from the IMF at the time. </p><p>For the last year and a half, while the macroeconomic team </p><p>has conducted the difficult negotiations with the Fund, the </p><p>top level of government has flailed around trying to get </p><p>high-level donor pressure on the Fund to back down on some </p><p>of its conditionality.  Many in the donor community </p><p>(including members of the EU and international financial </p><p>institutions) have expressed sympathy for the position. </p><p>But none of these urgent requests for flexibility have </p><p>helped soften the IMF position (recently confirmed during </p><p> </p><p>the Article IV consultations).  In addition, some have </p><p>suggested that it might be best for the GOH to request a </p><p>change in the IMF mission staff so that past differences of </p><p>opinion do not continue to color future negotiations.  The </p><p>GOH has asked the Embassy for its recommendations on this </p><p>rather sensitive suggestion. </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) Comment: There is a lot of truth to the GOH claims </p><p>that the underlying macroeconomic problems (such as the </p><p>statutes, the web of special tax exemptions and the ag debt </p><p>forgiveness programs, to name three) were inherited from </p><p>previous administrations and that the IMF perhaps should </p><p>have stood stronger against these policy lapses at the </p><p>time.  However, the problems are real and, if left </p><p>unaddressed, will continue to prevent the achievement of </p><p>macroeconomic stability and growth.  President Maduro needs </p><p>to get control over the public sector wage bill for the </p><p>good of the country, as well as for the purposes of an IMF </p><p>agreement.  Deep down, he knows this.  In addition to the </p><p>harm caused to efforts to balance the budget and invest in </p><p>the country\'s future, the statutes put the teachers and </p><p>doctors in a privileged class of public servants, to the </p><p>detriment of other public workers.  They must be changed at </p><p>some point. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) And, finally, the GOH has come a long way.  Post </p><p>believes strongly that now is the time for the USG to give </p><p>a little push.   Maduro badly needs reassurance from high </p><p>level USG officials that (1) the IMF-suggested civil </p><p>service reforms (and the ensuing political fight) are </p><p>indispensable, (2) the international community will support </p><p>him if he does take this move, and (3) that an IMF </p><p>agreement would likely be forthcoming quickly after passage </p><p>of the law even if all IMF targets for reduction of the </p><p>public sector wage bill are not completely met.  Post seeks </p><p>Washington agencies\' input and advice on whether this is </p><p>appropriate and how best to achieve it.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
