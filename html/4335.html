<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 008252 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, PINR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S DEEP STATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 7606 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 7230 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 2431 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 7682 </p><p>     E. ANKARA 7683 </p><p>     F. ANKARA 8165 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador W.R. Pearson; reasons: 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The Turkish Deep State, the behind-the-scenes </p><p>machinery and power relationships among selected members of </p><p>the military, judicial, and bureaucratic elite, has endured </p><p>as an essential factor in political life and in citizens\' </p><p>wary calculations of their relation to the State.  Now, </p><p>however, Deep State supremacy is being challenged step by </p><p>step with an openness rare in the history of the Turkish </p><p>Republic.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>The Apparat of the Turkish State </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Turks are statists in that they have been inculcated </p><p>to believe in an immanent, authoritative State power </p><p>disconnected from, and superior to, the role granted by the </p><p>constitution to elected politicians.  At the same time, the </p><p>great majority of Turks is frustrated, distrustful, even </p><p>fearful of the State as an increasingly out-of-date, </p><p>authoritarian, inefficient and unaccountable brake on their </p><p>freedoms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In describing this relationship, Ankara\'s reporting </p><p>has distinguished between the formal, Kemalist State, whose </p><p>unaccountability is problematic enough for the man in the </p><p>street, and what Turks refer to as the Deep State (derin </p><p>devlet), most recently in refs A and B.  Turks use the latter </p><p>concept to explain how real power is exercised -- through </p><p>informal, para-judicial governance motivated by an expansive </p><p>definition of national security.  Deep State views, </p><p>articulated through the military-dominated National Security </p><p>Council (NSC -- constitutionally only an advisory body) and </p><p>other organs, continue to shape the political landscape in </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) One former NSC staffer explained to us that the heart </p><p>of the Deep State is the presidency (which on paper has </p><p>limited powers), the military (which formally reports to the </p><p>P.M.), and the (formally independent) judiciary.  The </p><p>staffer, who was also a member of the West Working Group </p><p>which helped execute the "post-modern" coup against the </p><p>Islamist Erbakan government in 1997, explained further that </p><p>the elected government is only the Deep State\'s servant. </p><p>While the Deep State influences government activity, the </p><p>government has virtually no influence on the Deep State; if </p><p>the Deep State really wants to keep someone (the staffer was </p><p>referring to AK Party chairman Erdogan) out of power, that </p><p>person will stay out, he asserted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>The Special Problem of Unaccountability </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The lack of accountability in the Kemalist State in </p><p>general, and more specifically in the Deep State, is a legacy </p><p>from three sources.  First, centuries of Ottoman practice. </p><p>Second, the tradition of Muslim brotherhoods (tarikats) and </p><p>their emphasis on secrecy and discretion.  Third, the cadre </p><p>hierarchies of Marxism-Leninism and fascism, parallel to but </p><p>more authoritative than institutions of the state; these </p><p>models were prominent on the European stage in the 1920\'s as </p><p>the founders of the Republic of Turkey set up their state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A variety of political, academic, and journalist </p><p>contacts tells us that this unaccountability of the Deep </p><p>State manifests itself in different ways. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Senior politicians from several parties have described to </p><p>us the challenge Parliament faces in trying to keep track of </p><p>all aspects of the Deep State\'s activities, including the </p><p>budgets and expenditures of various military funds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Contacts remind us that at times the Deep State has relied </p><p>on extra-judicial enforcement of its views.  While this </p><p>usually means use of hints or indirect intimidation, in the </p><p>past it has also involved an unsavory nexus among security </p><p>and intelligence services; the armed forces; and groups -- </p><p>such as (Turkey\'s) Hizbullah and mafias -- fostered by them. </p><p>The Susurluk scandal, which broke in 1996, is emblematic of </p><p>this aspect of the Deep State (ref C and previous). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>The Military </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Turkish military has demonstrated its presence at </p><p>the heart of the Deep State not through any provision of the </p><p>constitution but through Article 35 of the Internal Services </p><p>of the Turkish Armed Forces Law, which states that the </p><p>military has the "duty to protect and safeguard the Republic </p><p>of Turkey."  It has carried out four coups in 42 years.  The </p><p>current (1982) constitution was drafted under military </p><p>direction.  Moreover, the military has expanded its oversight </p><p>by penetrating in a significant way into the industrial and </p><p>financial sectors through its officer pension fund Oyak. </p><p>This monitoring function shows itself in other ways as well. </p><p>Referring to a report in Nov. 7 Kemalist "Cumhuriyet" that </p><p>the West Working Group has been reactivated, our former </p><p>NSC/WWG staffer contact told us the group has been up and </p><p>running under a new name since May 2002 "in monitoring mode </p><p>for now." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) While new Chief of the TGS Gen. Ozkok is showing </p><p>patience at the beginning of AK\'s tenure, we are hearing </p><p>reports that institutional interests, pressures from younger </p><p>officers to take a harder line, and suspicions of some senior </p><p>commanders that Ozkok is "too liberal" are making their </p><p>presence felt in the military hierarchy.  That said, the </p><p>upper policy-making levels at TGS appear to share Ozkok\'s </p><p>perspective.  At the same time, retired Navy CNO Ilhami </p><p>Erdil, who had just made a round of the service chiefs, told </p><p>the Ambassador Nov. 6 that the military leadership will be </p><p>watching AK carefully, paying particular attention to the </p><p>appointments of the next P.M. and ministers of defense, </p><p>justice, interior, and education.  Erdil noted the importance </p><p>to the generals of "keeping parliamentarians in line" and </p><p>indicated that the generals have three red lines: Kemalism, </p><p>"secularism", and territorial integrity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>The Judiciary -- and the Establishment Press </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) A long-serving Justice of the Constitutional Court </p><p>(the Turkish Supreme Court) recently described to us the </p><p>workings and influence of the Deep State, by which he meant </p><p>primarily military domination of the Turkish system.  The </p><p>judiciary, he explained, is not independent, but a </p><p>subordinate, albeit important, part of the wider machinery </p><p>perpetuating the Kemalist status quo.  As he described it, </p><p>the legal educational system is set up to produce </p><p>unimaginative, narrow-minded judges and prosecutors </p><p>indoctrinated with the State\'s official Kemalist ideology. </p><p>More important, judicial fealty to Kemalism and to the Deep </p><p>State is the result of a fear so pervasive, the Justice </p><p>asserted, that it is "difficult for Americans to appreciate." </p><p> Mindful of the threat of force implicit in the Deep State\'s </p><p>orders to civilians, judges and prosecutors fear that if they </p><p>deviate from the orthodoxy they will be  entangled in </p><p>career-blunting reprimand procedures, demoted, hounded out of </p><p>office, or worse.  Those relatively few judicial officials </p><p>willing to resist such pressure usually are transplants to </p><p>the judicial bureaucracy from outside that system. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) The Justice explained that while the Deep State can </p><p>make its views clear by directly communicating them through </p><p>"telephone justice" to judicial officials, word is most often </p><p>promulgated indirectly through the National Security Council, </p><p>and by senior journalists who are known to have special </p><p>relationships with the powers-that-be: he acknowledged Sedat </p><p>Ergin of mass circulation "Hurriyet" as an exemplar (in a </p><p>subsequent conversation, AK Party vice chairman Mercan spoke </p><p>in similar terms about "paid agents" in the press such as </p><p>"Hurriyet"\'s Fatih Altayli).  According to the Justice, Deep </p><p>State pressure and influence has transformed Turkish </p><p>President Ahmet Necdet Sezer.  In his view -- and in our </p><p>experience -- Sezer was much more willing to promote </p><p>democratic freedom and human rights during his tenure as </p><p>Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court, where he served </p><p>before becoming Head of State.  As President, however, Sezer </p><p>has been pressured into adopting the more restrictive line </p><p>set by the military-dominated NSC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>The Bureaucracy at Large </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) In early October a 40-year-old Turk who has entered </p><p>center-right politics in the footsteps of his father after a </p><p>career in an elite ministry and in the presidency gave us </p><p>other insights into how the Turkish Deep State works.  He </p><p>explained that, in every bureaucracy and every ilce </p><p>(provincial county), the Deep State has individuals it can </p><p>rely on to (1) keep tabs on internal developments and (2) to </p><p>make clear the Deep State position on particular issues that </p><p>concern national security.  This system involves not only </p><p>ministries, such as Interior, that traditionally have been </p><p>associated with maintaining domestic peace and order, but </p><p>Education and others deemed to play an essential role in </p><p>maintaining the dominance of Kemalist institutions and ideas. </p><p> Someone in each ilce will have the keys to the local arsenal </p><p>("How do you think the right-wing nationalist MHP supporters </p><p>got their guns during the murderous clashes of the late </p><p>1970\'s?" he asked).  A local Education Ministry rep will know </p><p>that he is slated to become rector of a certain university </p><p>some years down the line if he carries out his Deep State </p><p>functions well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Deep State views continue to exercise leverage over </p><p>the political game in Turkey, and as such constitute a major </p><p>obstacle to democratization and reform.  However, Deep State </p><p>supremacy is not all-efficient: as one staunch secularist put </p><p>it, "the Deep State is very, very deep, like a diver under </p><p>the sea" (i.e., so deep it\'s unable to move in a supple way </p><p>in the faster-paced contemporary world).  And the Deep State </p><p>is beginning to be challenged with an openness rare in the </p><p>history of the Turkish Republic.  The push is step by step. </p><p>It must contend with centuries of ingrained habit and fear. </p><p>But various political strands, tapping the growing popular </p><p>dissatisfaction with the Kemalist status quo, are </p><p>slipstreaming behind Turkey\'s formal bid for EU membership to </p><p>push for sweeping changes in the current status of </p><p>civilian-military/individual-State relations and to challenge </p><p>other Kemalist verities (refs D,E). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
