<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 004540 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: IZ, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: MFA DENIES VISA TO THE IRAQI AMBASSADOR IN THE PRC </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 102827 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Action request at para 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a meeting between the DCM and Tahsin Burcuoglu </p><p>(Director-General for Middle East, OIC, and North Africa </p><p>Affairs at the MFA) on July 18, Burcuoglu noted that the MFA </p><p>had recently instructed the Turkish embassy in Beijing to </p><p>deny a visa to the Iraqi Ambassador to the PRC (Muwaffaq </p><p>Muhammad Jasem Al-Ani Al-Tikriti). This was on the basis of a </p><p>request from the USG (reftel) to deny safehaven, asylum, or </p><p>assistance in leaving or entering Turkey to a specific group </p><p>of individuals within the leadership of the former Iraqi </p><p>regime (other issues discussed in the meeting reported </p><p>septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Burcuoglu noted that, even though Al-Tikriti\'s stated </p><p>intentions were to return to Baghdad through Turkey with his </p><p>family, the MFA would continue to deny him a visa. However, </p><p>Burcuoglu also asked if the USG had made any "updates" to the </p><p>aforementioned list of individuals. Specifically, if </p><p>Al-Tikriti is now off the list for any reason, the GOT would </p><p>like to know. The DCM thanked Burcuoglu for the GOT\'s </p><p>assistance in this matter, and promised to ask for guidance </p><p>on USG interest in Al-Tikriti\'s whereabouts and plans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACTION REQUEST: Please advise if there is any update </p><p>regarding USG interest in Al-Tikriti. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
