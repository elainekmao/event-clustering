<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 001850 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/PDA (OHILTON), WHA/CEN, PD TASK FORCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, PREL, KPAO, PGOV, IZ, HO </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION ON IMF, AUGUST 4, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Op-ed by Roberto C. Ordoez in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily </p><p>"La Tribuna" on 8/4 entitled "What does the Fund want?". "The </p><p>last Letter of Intent of the Honduran government with the IMF was </p><p>signed by the Carlos Flores administration. In September 2001, </p><p>the IMF unilaterally broke the agreement when they proved that </p><p>none of the promises we made to tighten our belt had been </p><p>fulfilled. The current administration has been unable to sign any </p><p>Letter because, according to key public officials, the figures </p><p>the IMF used to reach the last agreement were inaccurate, which </p><p>is yet to be proved." </p><p> </p><p>"The omnipotent IMF is the key to opening the gates of </p><p>international funding.  Without their blessing, there\'s no debt </p><p>relief or new loans. What it wants is to reinvent the </p><p>governments. It\'s the only way to please it, because our current </p><p>governmental model is about to collapse, but with a bureaucracy </p><p>that still wants a large piece of the budget." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
