<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002938 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, PRM AND H </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, KPAL, KWBG, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: STAFFDEL BODLANDER AND MAKOVSKY:  MONITORING UNRWA </p><p>301(C) CERTIFICATION IN THE WEST BANK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) In a May 30 visit to UNRWA\'s West Bank field, House </p><p>International Relations Committee Staffers Deborah Bodlander </p><p>and Alan Makovsky investigated UNRWA\'s compliance with </p><p>section 301(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act (which prohibits </p><p>UNRWA from using any USG assistance to provide services to </p><p>terrorists), as well as the continued relevance of UNRWA\'s </p><p>mandate fifty-four years after the original Palestinian </p><p>refugee crisis.  They also visited Jenin refugee camp to </p><p>inspect damages incurred during the April battle in the camp. </p><p> The staffers met with UNRWA West Bank field director Richard </p><p>Cook, deputy director Guy Siri, special assistant for </p><p>emergency programs Patrick Barbieri and public information </p><p>officer Sami Mshasha.  They were accompanied by regional </p><p>refugee coordinator Joan Polaschik and ConGen poloff </p><p>Elizabeth Sallies. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) West Bank Director Cook told the staffers that only </p><p>25 percent of UNRWA\'s 600,000 registered refugees in the West </p><p>Bank reside in refugee camps.  Most of the West Bank camps </p><p>are quite small (the largest has only 20,000 residents) and </p><p>vary in nature from a small neighborhood within a larger </p><p>urban area (such as Jenin refugee camp or Shu\'fat camp, </p><p>located within East Jerusalem) to stand-alone rural villages </p><p>(Fawwar camp).  Cook explained that the camp boundaries are </p><p>delineated only on maps and that the only visible sign on the </p><p>ground of where camps begin and end may be the quality of </p><p>housing in a particular area.  Cook noted that UNRWA does not </p><p>administer or police the camps, but only provides services </p><p>within the camps to registered refugees.  Cook added that, </p><p>under the current emergency circumstances, UNRWA provides </p><p>services to some non-refugees, such as emergency health care, </p><p>or food and water to areas that were isolated for extended </p><p>periods.  (In a separate meeting with refcoord, UNRWA\'s </p><p>Director of Relief Services in the West Bank confirmed that </p><p>UNRWA\'s non-medical assistance to non-refugees is limited </p><p>only to food assistance, and constitutes no more than 12 </p><p>percent of UNRWA\'s overall emergency food aid programs in the </p><p>West Bank.  UNRWA does not provide direct cash support to </p><p>non-refugees.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) In response to a question from the staffers, Cook </p><p>explained that camp committees (originally established by the </p><p>PLO and now elected by camp residents, according to a </p><p>representative social and political mix for that specific </p><p>camp) are UNRWA\'s key interlocutors within the camps.  While </p><p>they do not administer the camps (civil administration is the </p><p>responsibility of local government -- either Palestinian or </p><p>Israeli), the camp committees are the primary vehicle for </p><p>UNRWA officials and camp residents to exchange views.  Cook </p><p>reported that he meets regularly with all West Bank camp </p><p>committees, and uses the occasion to reinforce UNRWA </p><p>policies, including those on the neutrality of all UNRWA </p><p>facilities. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Cook told the staffers that Israeli authorities never </p><p>have approached UNRWA with allegations that its West Bank </p><p>facilities have been misused by terrorists.  Although the </p><p>Israeli press has carried such allegations, including charges </p><p>that an UNRWA warehouse in Balata refugee camp had been used </p><p>to stockpile weapons, Cook reported that the allegations </p><p>"simply are not true."  He said UNRWA does not even have a </p><p>warehouse or other storage facility in Balata camp. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Cook reported that UNRWA has a number of clear </p><p>policies and procedures in place to ensure that its </p><p>facilities are not misused and that its staff are not engaged </p><p>in illegal activities.  He reported that any UNRWA staff </p><p>member found in violation of these policies is punished.  In </p><p>addition, any UNRWA employee who has been convicted of a </p><p>crime receives administrative punishment from UNRWA, which </p><p>varies with the severity of the crime.  In a recent example, </p><p>UNRWA summarily dismissed a staff member convicted of murder </p><p>and refused to reinstate him after his sentence was commuted. </p><p> With regard to UNRWA facilities, UNRWA international staff </p><p>conduct unannounced, unscheduled visits to all 160 UNRWA </p><p>facilities in the West Bank every six months.  During the </p><p>visits, UNRWA international staff complete a comprehensive </p><p>inspection of the facilities, opening all cabinets, unlocking </p><p>all doors, and ensuring that all UNRWRA facilities are </p><p>properly identified (signposted, flags flying).  Refcoord </p><p>noted that UNRWA Headquarters\' Audit and Inspection </p><p>Department also conducts similar unannounced, unscheduled </p><p>visits to UNRWA facilities, in addition to their regular </p><p>audits of UNRWA programs. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Cook reported that UNRWA also has a number of clear </p><p>policies and procedures in place to ensure that known </p><p>terrorists or convicted criminals do not receive UNRWA </p><p>assistance.  For example, UNRWA policy is not to rebuild the </p><p>homes of suicide bombers destroyed by the IDF or damaged in </p><p>"work accidents."  Cook told the staffers that in early May, </p><p>two refugee shelters in Balata camp were destroyed by a "work </p><p>accident."  UNRWA refused the families\' request for </p><p>assistance in rebuilding the shelters.  However, UNRWA as a </p><p>general policy provides emergency humanitarian relief </p><p>(blankets, tents) to refugees in dire need of shelter, </p><p>including those whose homes have been damaged in work </p><p>accidents or destroyed by the IDF following a suicide </p><p>bombing.  In this particular instance, UNRWA provided </p><p>emergency assistance to the families of the would-be </p><p>bombmakers.  Cook said that, due to its humanitarian mandate, </p><p>UNRWA could not refuse such basic needs to the families of </p><p>refugees engaged in illicit activities. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Cook emphasized that UNRWA utilizes a system of </p><p>stringent criteria and well-trained social workers to ensure </p><p>that only qualified, non-criminal refugees receive relief </p><p>assistance from UNRWA.  Before the current crisis began in </p><p>September 2000, only 8,000 refugee families -- five percent </p><p>of the West Bank refugee population -- received UNRWA\'s </p><p>"special hardship" assistance of food rations and some direct </p><p>cash assistance.  Today, 98,000 families receive food </p><p>assistance from UNRWA.  Cook assured the staffers that UNRWA </p><p>makes every effort to ensure refugees involved in illicit </p><p>activity do not receive UNRWA services.  For example, any </p><p>refugee serving a prison term is removed from UNRWA\'s special </p><p>hardship rolls, and his/her family\'s assistance is </p><p>subsequently reduced.  The staffers questioned Cook on the </p><p>procedures used by UNRWA to inform refugees of the penalties </p><p>and risks of involvement in terrorism, and suggested that </p><p>UNRWA could do a better job of informing refugees of the cuts </p><p>in services associated with involvement in illicit activity. </p><p>They said it would be helpful if UNRWA would reiterate its </p><p>relief policies in writing.  They also pressed UNRWA to </p><p>institute similar policies to ensure that convicted criminals </p><p>do not receive health or education services. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Finally, the staffers noted that some members of </p><p>Congress have suggested that UN Security Council Resolutions </p><p>governing the presence of armed elements in civilian refugee </p><p>camps may apply to UNRWA, especially those resolutions </p><p>requiring the UNSYG to report to the Security Council any </p><p>information regarding armed elements in UN camps.  While the </p><p>staffers acknowledged that the applicability of these </p><p>resolutions to UNRWA may be unclear, they urged UNRWA to do </p><p>everything possible to encourage an atmosphere of nonviolence </p><p>within Palestinian refugee camps.  They pressed UNRWA to </p><p>develop standard policies and procedures for handling </p><p>information regarding illicit activities in the camps (e.g., </p><p>how and to whom to report the information).  Cook said that </p><p>he personally was not sure whether such policies currently </p><p>existed, but was certain that UNRWA would be willing to </p><p>investigate the possibility of instituting such a policy. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) ConGen Jerusalem cleared this message. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
