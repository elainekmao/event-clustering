<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 KATHMANDU 001329 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, PGOV, PREL, KMDR, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: WEEKLY NEPAL MEDIA REPORT: JULY 8 - 14, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>-  STATE FOR NP, AC, PM </p><p>-  STATE FOR IN/R/MR </p><p>-  STATE FOR SA/INS, PM/CBM, PM/PRO </p><p>-  STATE FOR SA/PPD </p><p> </p><p> 1.  POLITICAL AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p> PEACE TALKS </p><p> </p><p> -- Government, Maoists hold talks: Members of the </p><p> negotiating teams of the government and the Maoists </p><p> held an informal meeting in Kathmandu to create a </p><p> congenial atmosphere for the third round of the peace </p><p> talks.  However, the talks failed to set a date for the </p><p> next round of the talks.  (Government-owned " Rising </p><p> Nepal," E/D, 7/14) </p><p> </p><p> -- Government formally calls Maoists to resume talks: </p><p> The government sent (7/13) a formal letter to the </p><p>Maoist leadership with the proposal for sitting down </p><p>for formal dialogue as soon as possible. (Media </p><p>reports, 7/14) </p><p> </p><p>-- Question mark looms over talks: A question mark </p><p>suddenly arose over the continuation of peace talks </p><p>between the Maoists and the government today (7/13) </p><p>with both the parties making moves and counter moves. </p><p>In a day of fast paced developments, the Maoists </p><p>threatened not to sit for the next round of peace talks </p><p>unless and until the government honored the agreement </p><p>it had reached with them over deployment of the army in </p><p>the second round of peace talks held in May, and also </p><p>freed three top Maoist leaders.  The government </p><p>responded to the Maoists\' threat by sending a letter </p><p>formally inviting them to the third round of talks. </p><p>But the letter was not written by Prime Minister Surya </p><p>Bahadur Thapa.  Nor was it addressed to the Maoist </p><p>supremo; it was signed by Information and </p><p>Communications Minister Kamal Thapa and sent to Maoist </p><p>talks team leader Dr Baburam Bhattarai. (pro-India </p><p>"Himalayan Times," E/D, 7/14) </p><p> </p><p>-- Movement reaches village level: The movement </p><p>launched by major political parties to make the king </p><p>less powerful but respectable has reached the village </p><p>level. (centrist "Deshantar," V/W, 7/13) </p><p> </p><p>-- Security tightened in mid-west: Security in most of </p><p>the districts in the mid-western region has been beefed </p><p>up.  This follows an atmosphere of uncertainty, </p><p>generated by a lull in the resumption of talks between </p><p>the government and the Maoists.  Meanwhile, the local </p><p>administration has issued a curfew order in Dang </p><p>district where the Maoists had carried out a massive </p><p>attack on the army base two-and-a-half years ago. </p><p>(Media reports, 7/13) </p><p> </p><p>-- Peace talks vulnerable: "The peace talks process is </p><p>at a vulnerable point". Despite the four rounds of </p><p>informal talks, the formal one is still uncertain... </p><p>The security wing is now specially alert and vigilant." </p><p>(centrist "Bimarsha," V/W, 7/11) </p><p>-- The joint movement is a big pain for Nepali </p><p>Congress. (centrist "Nepalipatra," V/W, 9/11) </p><p> </p><p>-- UML suspends senior party leader: The fourth central </p><p>committee meeting of the UML suspended (7/8) party </p><p>central committee member Radha Krishna Mainali from his </p><p>position for six months.  Mainali was charged of </p><p>protesting the joint movement launched against </p><p>regression, and supporting the king\'s retrogression </p><p>through his many articles published in the past. (Media </p><p>reports, 7/9) </p><p> </p><p>PALACE IN SEARCH OF PRIME MINISTER AGAIN </p><p> </p><p>-- Girija Prasad Koirala [former Prime Minister and </p><p>President of Nepali Congress] is set to be the next </p><p>Prime Minister.  Koirala is friendly with the Palace </p><p>now.  The joint movement is in a limbo.  (centrist </p><p>"Naya Kiran," V/W, 7/11) </p><p> </p><p>-- Girija Prasad Koirala is getting closer to the </p><p>Palace these days.  There has been a new political </p><p>consensus between the Girija clique and the palace in </p><p>the initiatives and directions of the Indian power </p><p>center.  Koirala is now </p><p> playing a double standard by </p><p>telling the Maoists that "the movement should be now </p><p>for the Republic State" and telling the palace that it </p><p>was he only who could save it from the crisis. (pro- </p><p>Maoists "Jana Dharana," V/W, 7/10) </p><p> </p><p>-- The Royal Palace is finally unsatisfied with Prime </p><p>Minister Thapa as he could not include any other </p><p>political party in the government.  The Palace is now </p><p>on the lookout for a new Prime Minister.  It has eyed </p><p>on three figures: Speaker of the House Taranath </p><p>Ranabhat, former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and </p><p>former Speaker of the House Daman Nath Dhungana. </p><p>(centrist "Ghatana Ra Bichar," V/W, 7/9) </p><p>2.  MAOIST ACTIVITIES </p><p> </p><p>-- Maoists confiscate citizenship certificates: Maoist </p><p>cadres confiscated citizenship certificates distributed </p><p>by a "Goodwill Team" of the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) in </p><p>Mugu district in mid July. (centrist "Kathmandu Post," </p><p>E/D and centrist "Kantipur," V/D, 7/12) </p><p> </p><p>-- Maoists restrict entry: The Maoists have imposed </p><p>restriction on entry to 10 remote VDCs of Kavre </p><p>district, as they declared them as a base area a week </p><p>ago. ("Kantipur," 9/11) </p><p> </p><p>3.  NEPAL-U.S. </p><p> </p><p>-- Nepal Trade Bill could still move in U.S. Senate: A </p><p>preferential legislation that would allow duty and </p><p>quota free access to Nepali garments could earn fresh </p><p>support from Senator Dianne Feinstein, provided </p><p>authorities in Nepal lend an assurance that they would </p><p>not deport Tibetan asylum-seekers in future, a </p><p>spokesperson at Senator Feinstein\'s office said today. </p><p>("The Kathmandu Post," 7/13) </p><p> </p><p>-- The bill: Industrialists are pressuring the </p><p>government to request U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein to </p><p>reintroduce the customs and quota free bill for Nepali </p><p>garments that she withdrew in May after 18 Tibetans </p><p>were deported back to China.  "They want a guarantee </p><p>from us that there will be no deportation in the </p><p>future," says a senior Foreign Ministry official.  "But </p><p>how can we issue such a guarantee?  We have accepted </p><p>more than 150,000 refugees in the country but if </p><p>someone arrives here illegally, we will have to deport </p><p>them."  Nepali garment manufacturers say the government </p><p>is not lobbying enough. (centrist "Nepali Times," E/W, </p><p>7/11) </p><p> </p><p>-- Violence and instability continue to depress U.S. </p><p>tourism to Nepal: The U.S. in a press release stated </p><p>that Nepal\'s violence and instability is having an </p><p>adverse effect on the number of American tourists </p><p>visiting Nepal.  "Unfortunately, continued political </p><p>turmoil and violent street demonstrations even after </p><p>the ceasefire have dampened thus far the expected </p><p>rebound in U.S. tourism," stated the release.  "Threats </p><p>and violence over the past two years from members of </p><p>the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) have caused a </p><p>dramatic decline in U.S. and other international </p><p>visitors.  As a direct result of Maoist violence and </p><p>threats, foreign tourism has declined by more than half </p><p>since 2000.  Instead of the 40,000 Americans, who </p><p>visited in 2000, only 16,000 U.S. visitors arrived in </p><p>Nepal in 2002."  The statement also cited reports of </p><p>trekkers being assaulted and robbed at gunpoint in </p><p>rural areas by Maoists. (Media reports, 7/11) </p><p> </p><p>-- Royal Nepal Army to be in Iraq: As U.S. soldiers are </p><p>being decimated because of Iraqi people\'s resistance, </p><p>it has asked for a military assistance from Nepal as </p><p>well.  The discussion the Thapa government is holding </p><p>on this makes it suspicious whether Nepal is longing to </p><p>deviate from its non-aligned foreign policy.  Experts </p><p>are saying that the sending off the Nepalese army to </p><p>Iraq would be a mistake and counterproductive. </p><p>However, top army officials are in consensus to send </p><p>Nepalese troops to Iraq.  The top officials had </p><p>stressed on sending the troops to Iraq, even if they </p><p>would be under the American command, when Prime </p><p>Minister Thapa asked them last week for an advice. </p><p>Their suggestion was based on two facts: U.S. military </p><p>assistance to suppress the Maoists and the economic </p><p>benefits the troops would make in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>-- Althou </p><p>gh the rulers of some Arab nations are U.S.- </p><p>supporters, the majority of people are anti-America. </p><p>If the troops are sent to Iraq, the lives of about half </p><p>million Nepalis will be unsecured.  The U.S. is asking </p><p>for Nepali troops only because it wants to keep its own </p><p>troops safe and use the Nepalis as mercenaries.  The </p><p>Americans want a very low casualty on its troops.  If </p><p>too many Americans die, President Bush will be an </p><p>unpopular figure. This will have a direct effect on the </p><p>next presidential elections. (leftist "Jana Aastha," </p><p>V/W, 7/9) </p><p> </p><p>-- Troops for Iraq: Pros and cons: The government is </p><p>reportedly considering the dispatch of an infantry </p><p>battalion to Iraq to join in the post-war </p><p>"stabilization force" there, as per a formal request by </p><p>the United States.  Given the grim state of </p><p>unemployment in the country, aided and abetted by </p><p>blatant misgovernance for twelve long years, can Nepal </p><p>really afford to turn a blind eye to the prospect of </p><p>thousands of valuable jobs in the massive re- </p><p>construction efforts that will be beginning very </p><p>shortly in Iraq?  Are there no dangers at all? Of </p><p>course, there are - as in UN peacekeeping operations! </p><p>For a professional Army that should not, however, be a </p><p>deterrent.  Instead, it should be treated as a valuable </p><p>opportunity to gain new experience that could stand the </p><p>nation in good stead in the future. (Op-ed in "The </p><p>Kathmandu Post, 7/9) </p><p> </p><p>-- USAID assistance to Nepal: The USAID has agreed to </p><p>Nepal with grant assistance worth 7.5 million dollars </p><p>to strengthen the rule of law in the country and </p><p>initiate anti-corruption measures.  The assistance </p><p>extending over three years will support Nepal\'s efforts </p><p>on strengthening the rule of law, enhancing access to </p><p>justice, and advancing accountability and anti- </p><p>corruption initiative. (Media reports, 7/9) </p><p> </p><p>4.  BHUTANESE REFUGEES </p><p> </p><p>-- Involve UNHCR in refugee verification: US envoy: </p><p>U.S. Ambassador Michael E Malinowski favors UNHCR\'s </p><p>involvement in the Bhutanese refugees\' verification </p><p>process.  In a letter to "The Kathmandu Post," </p><p>Malinowski said, "I strongly believe that UNHCR is </p><p>uniquely qualified to assist in the verification and </p><p>repatriation of the refugees."  The U.S. envoy added </p><p>that "the UNHCR is widely recognized by the </p><p>international community as having the expertise needed </p><p>to ensure that the repatriation and reintegration to </p><p>Bhutan is conducted in just and humane manner". </p><p> </p><p>-- He said this while expressing concern at the nature </p><p>and content of the report prepared by Nepal-Bhutan </p><p>Joint Verification Team (JVT) which was publicized on </p><p>June 18 amid much uproar among the Bhutanese refugees </p><p>in Nepal.  The report, which has huge inconsistencies </p><p>and thus leaves out a large number of Bhutanese </p><p>refugees as non-Bhutanese, rules out any chances of </p><p>their repatriation to Bhutan for all practical purposes </p><p>until their pleas are heard by the Druk authorities. </p><p>(The Kathmandu Post and others, 7/10.  Separate cable </p><p>sent earlier on this) </p><p> </p><p>-- Nepal, Bhutan discuss U.S. statement during </p><p>bilateral meet: A day after the U.S. ambassador to </p><p>Nepal expressed his dismay over the tardy progress in </p><p>the repatriation of the Bhutanese refugees from the </p><p>Khudunabari camp, Nepal and Bhutan discussed the U.S. </p><p>statement during their bilateral meet, held on the </p><p>sidelines of the SAARC Standing Committee meeting in </p><p>Kathmandu on Thursday. </p><p> </p><p>-- When reminded that the envoy had also issued a </p><p>veiled criticism of Nepal, Nepal\'s Foreign Secretary </p><p>Madhu Raman Acharya said, "I think what they are </p><p>reiterating...is the concerns of the refugees, which we </p><p>are also reiterating."  Meanwhile, Bhutan\'s officiating </p><p>Foreign Secretary S. T. Rabgye declined to make any </p><p>comment when "The Kathmandu Post" approached him for </p><p>his reaction to the U.S. statement.  "No comments," </p><p>said Rabgye, although he admitted that he had read the </p><p>reports in newspapers. </p><p>-- The refugee leaders, on the other hand, were upbeat. </p><p>The president of Bhutan National Democratic Par </p><p>ty and </p><p>the chief coordinator of the Association of Human </p><p>Rights Activists-Bhutan (AHURA, Bhutan) welcomed the </p><p>U.S. concerns. </p><p> </p><p>-- "This is very good news for us," said the president. </p><p>"This is the first time that the U.S. has expressed </p><p>such open support for us."  He added it was long </p><p>overdue in the light of the atrocities on the refugees. </p><p>The coordinator said that with U.S. showing interest in </p><p>the affairs of the refugees, things could be better for </p><p>the refugees.  There are more than 100 thousand </p><p>refugees in the UNHCR-run camps in eastern Nepal. ("The </p><p>Kathmandu Post," 7/11) </p><p>-- Bhutanese forum hails Ambassador Malinowski\'s </p><p>statement: "A two-day special meeting of the People\'s </p><p>Forum for Human Rights in Bhutan (PFHRB) concluded in </p><p>Siliguri, India, taking positively the U.S. Ambassador </p><p>Michael E. Malinowski\'s recent statement on the joint </p><p>verification team\'s report on Bhutanese refugee </p><p>categorizations. (The Kathmandu Post, 7/14) </p><p> </p><p>5.  PRESS AND MEDIA </p><p> </p><p>-- Private television channels launched: The Kantipur </p><p>Television Network (KTN) and the Image Metro Television </p><p>formally launched their transmissions on July 13.  The </p><p>KTN is the only channel in the private sector to have </p><p>acquired a license for the terrestrial transmission. </p><p>The Image TV will broadcast in and around the Kathmandu </p><p>Valley.  The KTN plans to expand its broadcast </p><p>throughout the nation and outside through satellite up- </p><p>link. (Media reports, 7/14) </p><p> </p><p>6.  REGIONAL </p><p> </p><p>-- Bhutto in Kathmandu: Former Pakistani Prime Minister </p><p>Benazir Bhutto, who is currently on a private visit to </p><p>Nepal, today said the main threat to democracy in South </p><p>Asia lies in periodic dictatorships, "which have shown </p><p>tendency to give birth to terrorism also." ("The </p><p>Kathmandu Post," 7/14) </p><p> </p><p>-- Pakistan accuses India of holding SAARC hostage: </p><p>Pakistan\'s Foreign Secretary Riaz H Khokhar rejected </p><p>(7/11) the Indian charge that his country was the </p><p>"slowest" member as far as SAARC economic agenda was </p><p>concerned and pointed out that this could be used as a </p><p>pretext by India to postpone the forthcoming Summit </p><p>once again.  He also blamed India for not holding </p><p>bilateral talks while the two countries\' foreign </p><p>secretaries were in Kathmandu.  On China\'s inclusion in </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>the SAARC, the Pakistani foreign secretary said, "We </p><p>would certainly welcome it" and claimed that "six out </p><p>of the seven members agree that China should be </p><p>associated, and if possible, made a member." (Feature </p><p>article in "The Kathmandu Post, 7/12) </p><p>-- SAARC Summit in January: All seven member-countries </p><p>of the SAARC agreed to hold the postponed 12th Summit </p><p>in Pakistan on January 4-6, with the preceding meetings </p><p>beginning at the end of December. (Media reports, </p><p>7/11)) </p><p> </p><p>7.  OTHERS </p><p> </p><p>-- Jurists slam Nepal\'s judicial set-up: The </p><p>International Commission of Jurists in a report says </p><p>that Nepal is perilously close to slipping from a </p><p>constitutional to an absolute monarchy as the integrity </p><p>of the Nepalese constitution is under severe strain, </p><p>with the king having failed to call elections. ("The </p><p>Himalayan Times," 7/13) </p><p> </p><p>-- Food shortage hits the eastern region: While the </p><p>food shortage has been a regular feature of remote far </p><p>western zone of Karnali, it now has extended to eastern </p><p>region as well, as five eastern districts including </p><p>Bhojpur, Khotang, Taplejung, Okhaldhunga and </p><p>Sankhuwasabha are facing with acute food-crunch </p><p>recently. ("The Kathmandu Post," 7/13) </p><p>-- 48 killed, 1,143 families affected: At least 10 </p><p>people were confirmed dead in separate incidents of </p><p>landslide and flood in various parts of the country on </p><p>Thursday.  The Home Ministry said (7/10) that 48 people </p><p>were killed and more than 1,140 families were affected </p><p>across the country since the onset of the rainy season. </p><p>("Kantipur," 7/11) </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
