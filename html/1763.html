<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001383 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NI, ECOWAS </p><p>SUBJECT: EUCOM BRIEFS DONORS AND ECOWAS ON ASSISTANCE </p><p>POSSIBILITIES </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  On June 12, EUCOM POLAD Ambassador Peter </p><p>Chaveas addressed a meeting of Diplomatic Missions in Abuja </p><p>interested in assisting ECOWAS in its peace-keeping and </p><p>conflict resolution activities.  Ambassador Chaveas briefed </p><p>the representatives on EUCOM\'s three pillars for ECOWAS </p><p>engagement; civilian control and defense reform, regional </p><p>capacity building, and military professionalism. </p><p>Representatives of the EU and other missions present spoke </p><p>briefly on their own current or planned programs with ECOWAS. </p><p> A general consensus emerged that ECOWAS, although </p><p>institutionally weak, had the political will to pursue its </p><p>peace-keeping and conflict resolution goals, and should be </p><p>supported with carefully targeted and mutually reinforcing </p><p>efforts by donor nations, especially efforts to strengthen </p><p>ECOWAS\' accountability, functional scope and institutional </p><p>capacity. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Chaveas also briefed ECOWAS Executive Secretary </p><p>Lansana Kouyate on June 13th on its three pillars of support. </p><p> Kouyate briefed in reply on the status of its initial steps </p><p>to erect the Mechanism on Conflict Prevention and Security, </p><p>including its four observation stations, central operations </p><p>center, Council of Elders, and stand-by units, all to be </p><p>financed by a 0.5% ECOWAS levy on imports from outside the </p><p>community.  Kouyate said a careful consideration of the </p><p>various EUCOM programs would bring a comprehensive response </p><p>by August.  He also agreed to a visit by the EUCOM DCINC the </p><p>same month.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On June 12, in a meeting hosted by Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, EUCOM POLAD Ambassador Peter Chaveas and EUCOM staff </p><p>briefed diplomatic missions interested in assisting ECOWAS on </p><p>the EUCOM outline of engagement with the ECOWAS Secretariat </p><p>in Abuja.  In attendance were the French DCM Gerard Gerold, </p><p>the Canadian Counselor, John McNeish, the German Ambassador </p><p>Armin Hiller and his DCM, Karlfried Bergner, The EU </p><p>Ambassador Veli Ollikainen, the Japanese Second Secretary </p><p>Matsumoto Koichiro, and the Dutch DCM, Michel Deelen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Chaveas began by cautioning the assembled diplomats </p><p>that, although EUCOM envisaged an ultimately broad engagement </p><p>with ECOWAS, for the moment EUCOM\'s relationship with ECOWAS </p><p>was "very embryonic."  EUCOM saw ECOWAS as the most promising </p><p>of regional organizations in regard to security issues, and </p><p>the proper initial forum for EUCOM\'s  desired sub-regional </p><p>engagement, a break from EUCOM\'s conventional focus on </p><p>bilateral endeavors.  An initial "get-acquainted" meeting </p><p>between ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate and EUCOM </p><p>DCINC General Fulford last October in Abuja was followed up </p><p>by a meeting with ECOWAS Chairman, President Oumar Konare of </p><p>Mali, in Bamako in February.  The meeting with Kouyate this </p><p>time, said Chaveas, would be the first real opportunity to </p><p>brief ECOWAS on existing program opportunities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Chaveas and EUCOM J-5 Division Chief Captain </p><p>Stephen Ewell then gave the assembled diplomats a rundown on </p><p>what EUCOM possibly could provide to ECOWAS, presented in the </p><p>form of three main themes of engagement: civilian control and </p><p>defense reform, regional capacity building, and military </p><p>professionalism.  Regarding civilian control and defense </p><p>reform, Chaveas and Ewell outlined the activities of the </p><p>Africa Center for Strategic Studies, and the various security </p><p>assistance programs available, FMS/FMF, EDA, and IMET. </p><p>Regional capacity building, Chaveas explained, could be </p><p>enhanced by participation in ACRI, Humanitarian Civic </p><p>Assistance, the Excess Property program, and other non-lethal </p><p>forms of assistance such as de-mining training, and </p><p>"Communications and Consequence Management".  Ewell briefly </p><p>described Operation Focus Relief\'s  training of individual </p><p>battalions for service in UNAMSIL operations in Sierra Leone. </p><p> Finally, Ewell briefed the diplomats on activities geared </p><p>toward military professionalism, including JCETs, ship </p><p>visits, FLINTLOCK and MEDFLAG exercises, and the prospective </p><p>African Regional Exercise Program, meant to integrate ACRI </p><p>and Focus Relief training into combined exercises for </p><p>regional entities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Canadian Counsellor John McNeish replied first, </p><p>noting that his government had plans underway to establish a </p><p>Child Protection Unit within ECOWAS, and to assist with the </p><p>establishment of a NGO network within the ECOWAS community to </p><p>feed information to its four "listening posts".  He cautioned </p><p>that ECOWAS could easily be overwhelmed by "too much support" </p><p>that was not carefully targeted.  German DCM Bergner stated </p><p>that the German Government was in a "fact-finding mode," as </p><p>the ECOWAS Secretariat was considered short-staffed and </p><p>disorganized, and "scrambling" to absorb many different </p><p>offers of assistance.  With only two military officers on its </p><p>staff, for example, ECOWAS headquarters had difficulty </p><p>planning for security contingencies as well as planning </p><p>actual deployments.  Institutional capacity-building appeared </p><p>an essential first step, said Bergner.  Some sort of aid for </p><p>an internal accounting system could be useful, he noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) EU Ambassador Ollikainen echoed the comments of the </p><p>first two speakers, saying that ECOWAS was very weak </p><p>institutionally.  The EU had a study underway of its various </p><p>capacities on political and economic issues, and was </p><p>considering some sort of budgetary support, although this was </p><p>a very preliminary idea, and the EU had considerable </p><p>misgivings about this.  The EU was also assisting with the </p><p>set-up of the four monitoring posts, now just underway, he </p><p>added.  Japanese Second Secretary Koichiro stated that the </p><p>Japanese Government had established a Japan-ECOWAS Trust Fund </p><p>with an initial one hundred thousand dollar contribution, to </p><p>be used for conflict prevention programs.  Koichiro noted </p><p>that ECOWAS did not lack ideas, but there was a dearth of </p><p>concrete initiatives to fund.  He also noted that the GOJ </p><p>preferred to deal through the UN, as funding restrictions </p><p>prevented the GOJ from working directly with ECOWAS on many </p><p>fronts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Dutch DCM Deelen said that direct Dutch cooperation </p><p>with ECOWAS was "very preliminary."  The Dutch Government had </p><p>donated trucks to UNAMSIL in Sierra Leone, indirectly </p><p>furthering ECOWAS endeavors, but direct assistance was not an </p><p>immediate prospect.  The Dutch Government had asked ECOWAS </p><p>for an "action plan."  Deelen commented that more funds for </p><p>assistance from the Dutch Government could be forthcoming, </p><p>but only if the capacity of ECOWAS to absorb it was clear. </p><p>French DCM Gerold also noted the institutional weakness of </p><p>ECOWAS, although the French Government was convinced of the </p><p>necessity to build cooperation with ECOWAS.  He noted the </p><p>very slow institutional decision-making structure of ECOWAS: </p><p>"Look how long it took to hire the new Deputy Director of the </p><p>Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, General Diarra," he asked </p><p>rhetorically.  (Comment: Filling this position has taken over </p><p>two years.  End comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Participants generally agreed on the importance of </p><p>assisting ECOWAS, despite its weak decision-making structure, </p><p>and its limited capacities on many levels.  ECOWAS had the </p><p>political will to take on regional conflict and attempt to </p><p>solve it, participants agreed, and this had to be nurtured. </p><p>The French and Canadian representatives noted the potential </p><p>harm in sending "mixed messages" to ECOWAS, supporting its </p><p>efforts generally while expressing distrust in particular </p><p>cases, most especially the plan to send an inter-positional </p><p>force to the Liberia-Guinea border area.  Both Ambassadors </p><p>Chaveas and Jeter strongly interjected that the great risks </p><p>of that plan, and the refusal of Guinea to allow deployment </p><p>on its soil, had far outweighed any slight to ECOWAS </p><p>sensibilities.  "We did not want to set up ECOWAS for </p><p>failure," said Chaveas.  As a final note, the diplomatic </p><p>representatives in attendance praised USG organization of </p><p>this first-ever donor meeting, and urged regular interactions </p><p>in the future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) On June 13, Ambassador Chaveas and Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, and EUCOM and Mission staff, met with Executive </p><p>Secretary Kouyate, Deputy Executive Secretary Diarra and </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>other ECOWAS officials.  Ambassador Chaveas noted at the </p><p>outset that EUCOM had "no great master proposal" for ECOWAS. </p><p>EUCOM and the USG wanted to hear fully from ECOWAS on its </p><p>needs and interests.  "Let us tell you what we have, so you </p><p>can better tell us what you need."  Ambassador Jeter </p><p>mentioned that ECOWAS was now fully certified to receive </p><p>direct U.S. assistance.  Captain Ewell then briefed on the </p><p>three pillars of program support outlined in paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  At the end of the briefing, Kouyate expressed </p><p>great interest in using IMET training for EOCWAS stand-by </p><p>force officers.  "The educational level of our troops in the </p><p>region is very low," he said.  "This sort of program is very </p><p>essential."  He also noted the complementarity of ACRI and </p><p>the French RECAMP programs, and said that ECOWAS wished the </p><p>stand-by units to ultimately train and exercise together, </p><p>with common airlift, logistics and command and control </p><p>mechanisms in place.  Regional training exercises would also </p><p>take care of the Nigerian "ego" problem of insisting its </p><p>troops already possessed full knowledge of modern tactical </p><p>and strategic concepts and were fully trained for regional </p><p>deployment.  Two regional depots, one coastal, one in the </p><p>interior, were envisaged to support joint deployments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Kouyate gave an overview of the ECOWAS Mechanism </p><p>for Conflict Prevention, Peace-Keeping and Security, noting </p><p>that three headquarters agreements had been already signed </p><p>for the four planned Observation Stations in Benin, Burkina </p><p>Faso, The Gambia and Liberia.  The Observation and Monitoring </p><p>Center at the ECOWAS Secretariat would, he said, ideally be </p><p>equipped with the latest equipment to ensure confidential </p><p>communications and real time information on regional events. </p><p>He noted that the UN was helping with the establishment of a </p><p>"data base" for this operations center.  He briefly described </p><p>the Council of Mediation and Security, and its sub-organs, </p><p>the Defense and Security Commission and the Council of </p><p>Elders.  He noted an ECOWAS-wide customs levy of 0.5% had </p><p>been agreed upon to fund the Mechanism, but "more funds" </p><p>would be needed to fully meet the needs of the Secretariat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Kouyate then said that his staff would digest the </p><p>EUCOM presentation, and develop a response by August. He also </p><p>pledged his willingness to receive an August visit by the </p><p>EUCOM DCINC, and hoped his staff would have its response </p><p>ready by that time.  Ambassador Chaveas replied that EUCOM </p><p>took a keen interest in enhanced ties with ECOWAS, and it </p><p>understood the heightened focus ECOWAS gave to early warning </p><p>systems with its Observation Stations and Observation Center. </p><p> He invited ECOWAS to send a representative to EUCOM </p><p>headquarters in Frankfurt to see how EUCOM manages its </p><p>operational responsibilities for 91 countries in Africa, </p><p>Europe and elsewhere.  Kouyate accepted, and the meeting </p><p>concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) Comment.  ECOWAS has just begun to bring the </p><p>Conflict Prevention and Security Mechanism to life.  Focused </p><p>and complementary assistance to ECOWAS by donor governments, </p><p>which does not exceed the organization\'s capacity to receive </p><p>it, and which enhances its ability to respond in an organized </p><p>and early manner to crises, appears the proper path to </p><p>pursue.  The universal judgement among interested diplomatic </p><p>missions in Abuja is that well-coordinated and targeted aid </p><p>will work best.  Although there is some hesitation among </p><p>interested Missions in Abuja regarding an organizationally </p><p>weak and under-staffed Secretariat, there is general </p><p>agreement that there is no alternative to ECOWAS and its role </p><p>in conflict prevention, resolution, and peacekeeping.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
