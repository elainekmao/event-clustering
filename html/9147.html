<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 THE HAGUE 001707 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AC/CB, NP/CBM, VC/CCB, L/ACV, IO/S </p><p>SECDEF FOR OSD/ISP </p><p>JOINT STAFF FOR DD PMA-A FOR WTC </p><p>COMMERCE FOR BIS (GOLDMAN) </p><p>NSC FOR CHUPA </p><p>WINPAC FOR FOLEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, RS, CWC </p><p>SUBJECT: CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION (CWC): RUSSIAN </p><p>COMMENTARY ON ABERDEEN DOCUMENTS AND ITS DESTRUCTION PROGRAM </p><p> </p><p>This is CWC-71-03. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1. In Delegation\'s view, during these meetings it became </p><p>clear that Russia does not intend, and perhaps never </p><p>intended, to abide by the present terms of the CTR MOU dated </p><p>14 March and signed by then-Director of the Russian Munitions </p><p>Agency Zinovy Pak.  The Russian delegation expressed its view </p><p>that the U.S. Aberdeen Chemical Destruction Facility </p><p>documents under consideration by the Council were </p><p>problematic, as written, because they identified a </p><p>non-contiguous commercial chemical facility as a declared </p><p>part of the Aberdeen destruction facility.  This was </p><p>problematic in that it set a precedent Russia would be unable </p><p>to follow.  Specifically, Russia could not declare the </p><p>various commercial facilities it intended to use to destroy </p><p>the "reaction mass" created by hydrolysis because it was </p><p>limited by law to declaring six destruction facilities. </p><p>Queried by the U.S. Delegation as to how this concern could </p><p>be reconciled with Russia\'s commitment, as embodied in the </p><p>March 14 MOU signed between the U.S. CTR program and t </p><p>he Russian Munitions Agency, to perform the final destruction </p><p>of such reaction mass as the CTR-funded Schuch\'ye facility, </p><p>the Russian delegation indicated that Russia would seek to </p><p>avail itself of the clause in the MOU which permitted the </p><p>parties to agree, in writing, to alternative arrangements. </p><p>In making this point, the Russian delegation indicated that </p><p>the MOU had been signed by Pak without the knowledge of other </p><p>interested officials in the Russian government and, in fact, </p><p>resulted directly in Pak fired. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Russian Federation is clearly of the view that all of </p><p>its CWPF conversions are "completed" except for buildings 352 </p><p>and 353 at Novocheboksarsk.  (These two buildings are </p><p>necessary to house equipment and operations associated with </p><p>the destruction of building 350).  All other conversion </p><p>requests, in the view of the Russian Federation, are complete </p><p>because the facilities are demilitarized.  The Russians, in </p><p>sharp contrast to the CWC, TS, US and others, do not accept </p><p>that a conversion is complete only when the agreed commercial </p><p>process is installed and producing "widgets."  This </p><p>difference will likely need to be aired at future EC\'s. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>"Problems" with U.S. Aberdeen Documents </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  On June 24, 2003, members of the U.S. delegation to the </p><p>33rd session of the OPCW Executive Council met with their </p><p>Russian counterparts to discuss a number of CWC-related U.S. </p><p>and Russian documents under consideration by the Council. </p><p>See wrap-up of EC-33, with final document outcomes, septel. </p><p> </p><p>4.  During the discussion, Russian representative Viacheslav </p><p>Kulebyakin, State Secretary of the Russian Munitions Agency </p><p>(RMA) indicated that the Russian Federation considers two of </p><p>the U.S. documents - the Facility Agreement and the Agreed </p><p>Detailed Plan for the Verification of Destruction of Chemical </p><p>Weapons at the Aberdeen Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, </p><p>Aberdeen, Maryland, to be problematic.  In particular, the </p><p>fact that the U.S. had declared a secondary treatment, </p><p>storage, and disposal facility at DuPont Chamber Works, as a </p><p>non-contiguous part of the Aberdeen destruction facility, </p><p>created a precedent that would cause Russia certain problems </p><p>(Note: The Aberdeen chemical weapon (CW) destruction facility </p><p>eliminates CW in a two-stage process.  In the first stage, CW </p><p>agent is neutralized through hydrolysis with water and Sodium </p><p>hydroxide at the Aberdeen Proving Ground facility in </p><p>Maryland. The resultant hydrolysate is subsequently </p><p>transported to the DuPont Chamber Works facility in </p><p>Deepwater, New Jersey, where it is irreversibly disposed of </p><p>through a biotreatment process.  In the interest of </p><p>transparency, the U.S. declared the DuPont facility as part </p><p>of the Aberdeen destruction facility, subject to verification </p><p>under the terms of the CWC.  End Note.)  Russia could not, </p><p>Kulebyakin concluded, join consensus on these two U.S. </p><p>documents during this session of the Council. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Kulebyakin noted that, inasmuch as Russia intended to </p><p>employ a similar process of hydrolysis for its nerve agent </p><p>stockpile, it would face the same prospect of having to </p><p>dispose of the hydrolysate, and intended to do so at </p><p>commercial facilities.  Moreover, under its laws Russia could </p><p>only maintain up to six CW destruction facilities.  It </p><p>followed from this that Russia could not declare all of the </p><p>commercial facilities it might use for final disposition to </p><p>be destruction facilities under the terms of the CWC, as the </p><p>U.S. had.  It was also not clear to Russia why the U.S. would </p><p>even want to do such a thing, given the additional burdens </p><p>(unelaborated) created by declaring a commercial facility to </p><p>be part of the Aberdeen production facility. </p><p> </p><p>6.  After discussing the issue internally, the U.S. </p><p>delegation pointed out that in a Memorandum of Understanding </p><p>(MOU) signed by former RMA Director Zinovy Pak, Russia had </p><p>committed to conducting final disposition of all nerve agent </p><p>at the U.S.-funded elimination facility at Schuch\'ye, as a </p><p>precondition for the release of $160M in CTR funds. </p><p>Therefore, the question of disposing of hydrolysate at </p><p>commercial facilities, over which Russia was expressing </p><p>concern, is moot. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Kulebyakin responded that Mr. Pak was no longer Director </p><p>of the RMA, and pointed to the clause in the MOU that allows </p><p>the parties to reach some alternative agreement in writing. </p><p>Ambassador Javits asked if he should report to Washingtonthat </p><p>Russia did not intend to abide by the terms of the MOU, i.e. </p><p>it did not/not intend to dispose of its nerve agent </p><p>hydrolysate at Schuch\'ye.  Kulebyakin responded that </p><p>Ambassador Javits should not, but also stated that Russia </p><p>intended to avail itself of the option to negotiate other </p><p>arrangements.  In doing so Kulebyakin asserted that Pak had </p><p>signed the MOU without the knowledge of anyone else, </p><p>including himself (Kulebyakin).  He said that when he </p><p>discovered what Pak had done, he was dismayed over the MOU\'s </p><p>contents. </p><p> </p><p>8. Kulebyakin stated that to ship hydrolysate to Schuch\'ye </p><p>from the various neutralization locations , would require the </p><p>expenditure of billions of dollars. The gas, electric and </p><p>water supply infrastructure at Schuch\'ye are inadequate for </p><p>the large-scale facility that would be required to do adhere </p><p>to the MOU.  Sizeable infrastructure upgrades would be needed </p><p>as well as the additional industrial facility, specifically </p><p>another destruction building.  Shipping hydrolysate across </p><p>thousands of kilometers of Russia would also mean that new </p><p>railroad track would have to be laid to avoid population </p><p>centers, since Russian law prohibits transporting such </p><p>material through population areas above a certain size. </p><p>Adequate rolling stock would also be required and is </p><p>extremely expensive to produce.  If the U.S. is willing to </p><p>pay for all this, it could be done.  Short of that, Russia </p><p>was simply not in a position to accommodate.  If the U.S. </p><p>wants it this way, the U.S. will need to pay for it - and the </p><p>price would be huge. </p><p> </p><p>9.  During bilateral consultations, Kulebyakin stated on </p><p>several occasions that the RF was having great difficulty in </p><p>attracting foreign investment to its converted facilities. </p><p>Deloff asked for a list of facilities that were having </p><p>difficulty in attracting foreign assistance.  RMA official </p><p>Michailov responded that chloroether, aminomercaptan, and </p><p>loading of sub-munitions into munitions at Novocheboksarsk </p><p>along with sarin production and soman production at Volgograd </p><p>do not have adequate foreign assistance.  The larger problem </p><p>is at Novocheboksarsk according to Michailov. </p><p> </p><p>10.  In a separate conversation, Mr. Valery Semin of the </p><p>Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed U.S. delegation </p><p>member David Weekman that Dr. Pak was fired by the Russian </p><p>Prime Minister and President Putin as a direct result of his </p><p>signing the 14 March CTR Amendment.  Semin claimed that this </p><p>agreement was not coordinated in Moscow.  (Comment: In </p><p>Delegation\'s view, during these meetings it became clear that </p><p>Russia does not intend, and perhaps never intended, to abide </p><p>by the present terms of the MOU.  The Russian Delegation\'s </p><p>comments during the June 23 destruction informals and during </p><p>the general debate at the EC (see septel) were consistent </p><p>with the approach they took in private meetings.  End </p><p>comment.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  Javits sends. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
