HALL FOR REASONS 1.5 ( </p><p>B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. WFP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JIM MORRIS HAS INFORMED ME THAT UP </p><p>TO 4.5 MILLION HUNGRY WOMEN, CHILDREN AND ELDERLY PEOPLE ARE </p><p>BEING CUT OFF FROM WORLD FOOD PROGRAM ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF A </p><p>LACK OF CONTRIBUTIONS. THESE ARE VULNERABLE PEOPLE THAT HAVE </p><p>BEEN RECEIVING FOOD AID ON A CONTINUAL BASIS AND WHO ARE NOW </p><p>BASICALLY HAVING TO FIND OTHER MEANS OF COPING IN THE MIDDLE </p><p>OF A HARSH KOREAN WINTER. </p><p> </p><p>2. MOREOVER, MORRIS IS CLEARLY WORRIED THAT PLEDGING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  06166  311117Z </p><p>SHORTFALLS COULD LEAD TO STEPS BACKWARD ON EVEN THE MODEST </p><p>GAINS THAT WFP HAS NEGOTIATED WITH THE NORTH KOREAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT SINCE 1995. IN THE WORST CASE, NORTH KOREA COULD </p><p>CLOSE THE WFP PROGRAM, RESULTING IN THE EXIT OF AROUND 50 </p><p>INTERNATIONAL STAFF, PRESENTLY POSTED THROUGHOUT A LARGE PART </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>3. HAVING VISITED NORTH KOREA SIX TIMES DURING MY YEARS IN </p><p>CONGRESS, I AM KNOWN TO THE PYONGYANG LEADERSHIP AND HAVE </p><p>BUILT UP A DEGREE OF ACCESSIBILITY AND TRUST WITH THEM. </p><p> </p><p>4. A HUMANITARIAN MISSION THERE IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE WOULD </p><p>PERMIT AN UPDATE ON RELIEF ASSISTANCE AND OTHER FRONTS AS </p><p>WELL.

THIS REQUEST IS PROMPTED BY YOUR STATEMENT, MISTER </p><p>SECRETARY, ON 12/29 THAT: "WE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>COMMUNICATE WITH THE NORTH KOREANS SO SOME SENSE CAN PREVAIL." </p><p> </p><p>6.
