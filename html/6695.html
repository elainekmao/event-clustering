<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000714 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR CA/OCS/ACS/EAP (DGOODING, SLAWRENCE) </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/EX JJENKINS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CASC, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: WARDEN MESSAGE - action request in paraS 1 and 5 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Mission has received and transmitted the travel warning ref </p><p>a.  However, Mission wishes to point out that the comment in the </p><p>third paragraph, ".the Department of State has suspended official </p><p>travel to Vietnam until further notice" is not the Mission\'s </p><p>understanding of the current situation.  Mission has merely </p><p>deferred non-essential TDY travel.  Some essential TDY travel </p><p>continues, and PCS and other official travel by officials </p><p>assigned to Mission continues as planned. </p><p> </p><p>Action requested:  Mission requests that the Department issue a </p><p>corrected travel warning immediately. </p><p> </p><p>2.  In addition, Mission sent the following update on the SARS </p><p>situation via the warden system on Monday afternoon (March 24th). </p><p>Mission would like to update and re-send the content of this </p><p>message daily. </p><p> </p><p>3.  BEGIN TEXT OF WARDEN MESSAGE SENT. </p><p> </p><p>Further to this morning\'s message, we will begin a daily update </p><p>of the SARS situation.  The picture is actually a bit improved </p><p>today: </p><p> </p><p>Authorized departure of Embassy family members: </p><p>Although WHO and CDC say the situation is confined and effective </p><p>steps have been taken to isolate those suspected of being </p><p>infected by SARS, in order to assure the peace of mind and safety </p><p>of mission families, especially those with children, the </p><p>Ambassador has requested, and the State Department has approved, </p><p>voluntary departure for dependents of Embassy and Consulate </p><p>staff.  (We do not yet have an indication of how many family </p><p>members, if any, intend to leave.) </p><p>The following statistics were taken from the World Health </p><p>Organization\'s (WHO) website.  This site is updated regularly and </p><p>can be found at www.who.int/csr.  Additional information can also </p><p>be found on the US Centers for Disease Control website at </p><p>www.cdc.gov. </p><p> </p><p>SITUATION AS OF MARCH 22, 2003 </p><p>Worldwide, all SARS cases are being classified based on whether </p><p>that case meets certain criteria based on serious symptoms </p><p>described on the WHO and CDC websites.  Although these symptoms </p><p>are strong criteria in an area with SARS, they may also pick up </p><p>some cases that are caused by other diseases unrelated to SARS. </p><p>While some laboratory data suggest possible viruses as being </p><p>responsible, it will still take some time to develop a test that </p><p>can positively detect SARS. </p><p> </p><p>Worldwide: </p><p>Number of cases worldwide:  386 </p><p>Number of deaths worldwide:  11 </p><p>Suspected and/or probable cases are found in the following </p><p>countries:  Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong Special </p><p>Administrative Region of China, Italy, Ireland, Singapore, </p><p>Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom, </p><p>United States, and Vietnam. </p><p>The WHO\'s website indicates 22 suspected cases in the United </p><p>States on March 22nd, CDC\'s website indicates 37. </p><p> </p><p>Vietnam: </p><p>(These figures do not include the "index patient" who came in </p><p>from Hong Kong, was later medically evacuated back to Hong Kong, </p><p>and sadly, died in Hong Kong.) </p><p>Number of cases in Vietnam: 63 </p><p>Number of deaths in Vietnam: 2 </p><p> </p><p>Unofficial Reports: </p><p> </p><p>Unofficial reports indicate that there were two new "probable" </p><p>cases admitted to Bach Mai hospital this weekend - both </p><p>epidemiologically linked to health care workers at the Hanoi </p><p>French Hospital. </p><p> </p><p>Unofficial reports further indicate: </p><p>-One patient who was on a mechanical respirator was extubated, </p><p>leaving 2 patients on ventilators and 4 patients in critical </p><p>condition. </p><p>-Most other patients remain stable and many are improving. </p><p>-Worldwide the rate of fatality among SARS cases is 3%. </p><p>-Two patients have recovered and been determined to be no longer </p><p>infectious to others and released to go home. </p><p>-The condition of the boy medically evacuated from Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City to Taipei continues to improve. </p><p>-The incubation period for SARS has passed and the boy\'s 65 </p><p>schoolmates who were on the same school trip have all been </p><p>determined not to have contracted SARS. </p><p>-There were two other possible SARS cases in Ho Chi Minh City, </p><p>but both have been ruled out. </p><p> </p><p>We hope this information is helpful.  Please look for further </p><p>updates each morning. </p><p> </p><p>4.  End text of warden message sent. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Given the time difference and the necessity to awaken OCS </p><p>duty officer to obtain clearance for warden messages, Mission </p><p>requests blanket clearance to update the content of the above </p><p>message and send the updated information each morning. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Mission also requests clearance to add the following </p><p>correction to tomorrow morning\'s warden message: </p><p>"Further to our warden message issued on the morning of March </p><p>24th, the following correction is necessary.  All official travel </p><p>to Vietnam is not suspended.  Some officials coming for non- </p><p>essential purposes have been asked to defer their travel. </p><p>Officials assigned to Vietnam and some official visitors continue </p><p>to travel to and from Vietnam.  The department of state remains </p><p>concerned about the unavailability of adequate healthcare in </p><p>Vietnam and continues to recommend that non-essential travel or </p><p>stays in Vietnam be deferred. </p><p> </p><p>7.  WHO and CDC, as well as the GVN, indicate that the outbreak </p><p>is confined in Vietnam and effective steps have been taken to </p><p>isolate those suspected of being infected by SARS. Barring any </p><p>new introduction of SARS to Vietnam, it does seem that the </p><p>situation is contained. </p><p> </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
