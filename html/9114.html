<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001148 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ASEC, PINS, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  HOSTAGE-TAKING IN THE DELTA </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) SUMMARY: Three third-country nationals employed by a </p><p>U.S. oil servicing firm were kidnapped June 23 by an Ijaw </p><p>criminal group in the swamps of Delta State.  Shell is </p><p>managing the crisis and claims it will not accede to  demands </p><p>of a ransom.  Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports indicate the </p><p>military is attempting a rescue.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU)  Anglo-Dutch Shell and Ft. Lauderdale-based Seabulk </p><p>International confirmed press reports of the June 23 </p><p>kidnapping of three expatriate staff on a Seabulk boat near </p><p>the Warri Southwest local government area (LGA).  The boat, </p><p>one of 24 vessels deployed in the Niger Delta by Seabulk, was </p><p>fulfilling a contract by Panama-based Willbros for Shell\'s </p><p>production and drilling platforms on the Yokri field in </p><p>Forcados.  The boat, manned by 12 expatriates (none </p><p>American), was confronted by 45 armed "pirates," according to </p><p>officials of both companies.  Reportedly the bandits were </p><p>from neighboring (to the east) LGAs of Borutu and Bomadi. </p><p>The German captain and two Filipino crew members were taken </p><p>by the pirates and are apparently being held in the creeks of </p><p>Borutu or Bomadi. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) Shell, the operator of the platform and an oil </p><p>company experienced in dealing with Niger hostage-takings, is </p><p>trying to resolve the incident with the consent of Seabulk </p><p>and Willbros, according to Seabulk\'s Port Harcourt-based </p><p>Operations Officer Tomasz Maczka.  In a June 30 conversation </p><p>with Embassy\'s Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO), Maczka </p><p>explained that Shell established an Emergency Response Team </p><p>(ERT) at its Warri Zonal Headquarters.  Shortly after the </p><p>hostage-taking, Shell received a letter  demanding an </p><p>immediate payment of 400,000 naira (approximately USD 3,000) </p><p>for food for the hostages and a ransom of 25 million naira </p><p>(approximately USD 200,000).  According to Maczka, Shell also </p><p>received photos of the hostages and passed these on to the </p><p>Seabulk General Manager, Roy Donaldson, who has moved to </p><p>Shell\'s Warri zonal headquarters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU)  Maczka expressed unhappiness with Shell\'s decision </p><p>to release a June 26 public statement giving details of the </p><p>kidnapping, enunciating Shell\'s policy of not paying ransom </p><p>to criminals, and appealing to the Nigerian government to </p><p>resolve the crisis.  He claimed that Shell did not consult </p><p>Seabulk or Willbros on the statement.  Maczka also drew a </p><p>connection between this publicity and June 30 press reports </p><p>that the Nigerian Army and Navy have deployed troops to </p><p>Borutu and Bomadi LGAs in an attempt to rescue the hostages </p><p>-- a move not welcomed by the Seabulk official. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) According to Shell\'s Director for External Relations, </p><p>Precious Omoku, Shell took the lead in this situation to </p><p>ensure that the two service contractors (Willbros and </p><p>Seabulk) did not pay ransom for the three expatriates.  He </p><p>confirmed that Shell was in contact with the hostage-takers </p><p>and was preparing through them food and medicine for the </p><p>hostages.  He claimed the Commander of the Army\'s 7th </p><p>Battalion in Warri has refuted the June 30 press report of a </p><p>military rescue operation.  Omoku further disclosed that the </p><p>chief of Shell\'s ERT was apparently shot at his residence the </p><p>night of June 28; cause of the shooting or identity of any </p><p>assailant is unknown.  To be safe, Shell has appointed a new </p><p>ERT chief. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) CRO on June 30 contacted Bello Oboko, President of </p><p>the Federated Niger Delta Ijaw Communities (FNDIC) -- the </p><p>group of armed Ijaw youth responsible for the ongoing </p><p>security crisis in the three Warri LGAs.  Oboko claimed he </p><p>was aware of the kidnapping but vowed his "boys" were not </p><p>responsible.  He attributed this act to Ijaw "pirates" </p><p>outside of FNDIC\'s area of operations.  Oboko expressed </p><p>annoyance with this action at a time when FNDIC is attempting </p><p>to guarantee the operational safety of oil company personnel </p><p>and facilities in order to resume production in the creeks of </p><p>Warri (to be reported septel).  The leader of the Warri </p><p>militants stated that he would find out who committed the </p><p>kidnappings and attempt to secure the hostages\' release. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(SBU) Ijaw leader Chief Edwin K. Clark told CRO July 1 that </p><p>he will soon host, at his Uhwelli residence, a meeting with </p><p>the Ijaw leaders of the Borutu and Bomadi villages in which </p><p>the hostage-taking "pirates" operate.  Disclosing that he </p><p>knows the boys behind the kidnapping, Clark said that he </p><p>opposed their "criminal behavior" and he would use this </p><p>meeting to pressure the communities to give up the hostages </p><p>and exert greater control over the criminal elements in their </p><p>ranks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(SBU) Comment:  Although the hostages are not AMCITS, this </p><p>new incident involves two U.S. companies with substantial </p><p>investments in the Niger Delta.   The companies\' decision to </p><p>allow Shell to take the lead is probably wise and hopefully </p><p>will lead to an outcome with no casualties or injuries. </p><p>However, we are concerned about the possibility of an </p><p>attempted military rescue effort.  The military lacks the </p><p>discipline and skills necessary to conduct a surgical rescue </p><p>in the harsh environment of the Delta.  The wild card in this </p><p>crisis is the FNDIC Ijaw militants, who may take on the </p><p>unusual role of rescuers as they seek to promote an image of </p><p>peace-makers and protectors. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
