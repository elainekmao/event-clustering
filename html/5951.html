<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000325 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSTIVE </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA, SA/INS/D </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  SRI LANKA CORE GROUP MEETING ON TOKYO DONOR </p><p>CONFERENCE/WASHINGTON  "SEMINAR" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p>1.   On February 25, Minister for Economic Reform, </p><p>Milinda Moragoda, chaired a meeting of the "Core Group" </p><p>to oversee the planning for the Donor Conference now </p><p>scheduled for Tokyo June 9-10.  Donors who have been </p><p>invited to co-chair the Tokyo meeting were requested to </p><p>be part of this Core Group.  Those attending the meeting </p><p>included the Japanese Ambassador and representatives of </p><p>JABEC, the Norwegian Ambassador, the Country directors </p><p>for the IMF, World Bank, ADB and UNDP and Ambassador </p><p>Wills and the USAID Director. The GSL representatives </p><p>included the Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Secretary </p><p>General of the Department of External Resources and </p><p>several key advisors in the Ministry of Policy </p><p>Development and Implementation. </p><p> </p><p>2.  In preparation for the Tokyo Conference, four pre- </p><p>Tokyo Seminars will be held, the first of which is </p><p>planned for Washington on April 14 for a half day. </p><p>Ambassador Wills pointed out that this seminar cannot </p><p>have LTTE representation. This was accepted by the </p><p>group.  When asked about US views on program content for </p><p>the Washington Seminar, the Ambassador deferred to the </p><p>GSL to determine what it wanted to accomplish at that </p><p>seminar.  Minister Moragoda stressed that he hoped that </p><p>the Washington event would feature attendance by </p><p>ministers attending the IMF and IBRD annual meetings. </p><p>He was especially interested in having ministers from </p><p>countries not attending any of the other seminars or the </p><p>Tokyo conference at the Washington meeting, i.e., Saudi </p><p>Arabia, the Gulf States, etc.  The second seminar will </p><p>be hosted by Brussels (and Norway); the third is planned </p><p>for Colombo on May 3 and the Japanese Ambassador said </p><p>the GOJ would like to host a fourth seminar in Tokyo </p><p>prior to the main conference in June. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The discussion covered a variety of topics including </p><p>the purpose and composition of the Wider Tokyo group, </p><p>the status and timing for the completion of key </p><p>documents to be presented in Tokyo and their </p><p>availability prior to the Conference, and preliminary </p><p>preparations for the seminars and outline for the Tokyo </p><p>Conference program.  There was considerable discussion </p><p>regarding the issue that is being raised in other fora </p><p>by several bilaterals about attaching conditionality to </p><p>pledges in Tokyo.  Ambassador Wills pointed out that the </p><p>LTTE needs to do something meaningful prior to Tokyo to </p><p>get maximum generosity from the donors and to bolster </p><p>the GSL\'s standing in the south. </p><p> </p><p>4..The next Core Group planning meeting to discuss in </p><p>more detail the programs and expected outcomes of the </p><p>four pre-Tokyo seminars and Tokyo Conference itself is </p><p>scheduled for March 10 and will be followed by an </p><p>information meeting with an Expanded Tokyo group. </p><p> </p><p>5. Comment:  We still don\'t know exactly what the GSL </p><p>wants to accomplish at the Washington seminar or at the </p><p>other three pre-Tokyo seminars.  But we expect this to </p><p>be clarified in the days ahead as the GSL focuses on the </p><p>matter.  This meeting was its first attempt to do so. </p><p>Our guess is that the Washington seminar will be an </p><p>occasion to attract high-level, preferably ministerial- </p><p>level donors to a discussion of the situation in Sri </p><p>Lanka.  No pledging will be involved.  We shall be pesky </p><p>to the point of obnoxiousness in seeking clarification </p><p>of what the GSL and the Core Group want to emerge from </p><p>the Washington seminar because we know the Department </p><p>and USAID are keen to be informed. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
