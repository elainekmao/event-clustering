<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 000352 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>YAOUNDE ALSO FOR EMBASSY BANGUI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:12/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PBTS, SENV, EPET, EFIS, NI, CM </p><p>SUBJECT:  Bakassi -- Meeting with Ould-Abdallah: Cameroon </p><p>Bound to a Reticent Biya and Nigeria\'s Commitment Uncertain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Yaounde 171 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER.  REASON: 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action message; see para 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary:  Nigeria\'s approach to its border dispute </p><p>with Cameroon is sophisticated, but its commitment to execute </p><p>what it negotiates less certain, UNSYG representative Ould- </p><p>Abdallah told Ambassador Jeter.  However, the Cameroonians </p><p>understood international boundary law less well and were </p><p>hobbled by Biya\'s odd combination of micro-management and </p><p>aloofness.  Ould-Abdallah thought continued confidence- </p><p>building measures (CBMs), together with an early Summit of the </p><p>near-moribund Lake Chad Basin Commission, would help advance </p><p>the process.  Ould-Abdallah asked us to encourage Biya to </p><p>visit Nigeria; reftel offers an opening.  See also </p><p>recommendation in para 10.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>MAKE HASTE SLOWLY </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) During a private breakfast meeting at the Residence, </p><p>UNSYG Representative to West Africa Amadou Ould-Abdallah </p><p>February 6 told Ambassador Jeter that Nigerian President </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo was personally interested in resolving </p><p>border issues affecting Nigeria\'s relationship with Cameroon. </p><p>However, Obasanjo faced internal pressures that forced him to </p><p>move deliberately.  The reconciliation process needed a firm </p><p>foundation resting on mutual confidence-building measures </p><p>(CBMs); without them, full implementation of the ICJ ruling </p><p>that awarded Bakassi and territory in and around Lake Chad to </p><p>Cameroon would be difficult.  Moreover, the Nigerian press </p><p>could prove especially nettlesome.  The sentiment that </p><p>"Bakassi is ours" prevails in many major Nigerian </p><p>institutions, including the military, the Ambassador also </p><p>noted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ould-Abdallah said Obasanjo would have to "go slowly" </p><p>until the national elections were over.  The UN envoy said he </p><p>had proposed an interim exchange of military liaison officers </p><p>but that Nigeria was "not interested for now."  Biya needed to </p><p>visit Abuja before the elections, Ould-Abdallah argued, </p><p>pointing out that Obasanjo had consistently made himself </p><p>available; it was time now for Biya to reciprocate.  The two </p><p>leaders could use their meeting to announce a Summit of the </p><p>near-moribund Lake Chad Basin Commission.  Cameroon\'s key </p><p>concern, Ould-Abdallah said, was the fate of its citizens </p><p>living in and around Lake Chad.  As the waters of this great </p><p>inland sea have receded over the past 50 years, Nigerians have </p><p>moved into Cameroonian territory, sometimes even receiving </p><p>what purported to be land titles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>IT\'S NOT JUST BAKASSI </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Resolving land tenure issues in the North could </p><p>ultimately prove more difficult than finding solutions for </p><p>Bakassi.  Ould-Abdallah agreed with the Ambassador that most </p><p>permanent residents of Bakassi identified themselves as </p><p>Nigerians.  However, contrary to Nigerian assertions of a </p><p>Bakassi population of 300,000-plus, the permanent residents </p><p>probably numbered 30,000-50,000, and a significant number were </p><p>Ghanaian or Beninois fishermen.  The seasonal surge, almost </p><p>all fishermen, was heavily Ghanaian and Beninois, according to </p><p>Ould-Abdallah. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In response to the Ambassador\'s query, Ould-Abdallah </p><p>confirmed that Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who opened the </p><p>Mixed Commission meeting for the GON, had affirmed Nigeria\'s </p><p>desire to settle the boundary dispute peaceably.  The key </p><p>question, Ould-Abdallah offered, was whether Nigeria would </p><p>stick to its commitments.  The Nigerian delegation was much </p><p>stronger and deeper, with a genuine international expert on </p><p>boundary issues (Prince Bola Ajibola) at its head while the </p><p>Cameroonians were led by a competent but far less expert </p><p>figure, Minister of Justice Amadou Ali.  At least, the UN </p><p>representative commented, Cameroon had had the good sense to </p><p>keep its unhelpful Permanent Representative to the United </p><p>Nations, Martin Belinga Eboutou, in New York.  Belinga\'s </p><p>deadlines and timetables were disruptive and destabilizing. </p><p>Moreover, Ould-Abdallah continued, Belinga was obsessed with </p><p>bringing implementation to conclusion before Cameroon\'s UNSC </p><p>term ended, falsely fearing that Yaounde would lose leverage </p><p>once 2003 comes to an end.  Biya, however, understood the need </p><p>for patience, grasping that Obasanjo faced elections and did </p><p>not have the freedom to act that Biya himself enjoyed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>CAMEROONIAN CHARM OFFENSIVE REQUIRED </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) What Biya apparently did not comprehend was that he </p><p>had to reach out to Obasanjo, to follow African diplomatic </p><p>traditions to resolve differences.  While Obasanjo had </p><p>received the Mixed Commission for 40 minutes during its Abuja </p><p>meeting, Biya had been unavailable during the Commission\'s </p><p>previous meeting in Cameroon.  As the "victor" in the dispute, </p><p>Biya had to make a conciliatory gesture toward Obasanjo.  He </p><p>needed, Ould-Abdallah repeated several times, to visit Abuja </p><p>before Nigeria\'s elections and to commit himself to attend a </p><p>follow-on extraordinary Lake Chad Basin Commission Summit. </p><p>Would the U.S. please use its influence with Biya to encourage </p><p>him in this direction?, Ould-Abdallah implored. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) COMMENT:  In this letter to President Bush (reftel), </p><p>Biya states, inter alia, "I would like you in person and your </p><p>country to help Nigeria and Cameroon to comply with and </p><p>enforce...the ruling.  Cameroon has been striving to show a </p><p>sense of moderation and patience so as to give peace and </p><p>justice a chance." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Biya\'s assertion is valid up to a point.  The </p><p>Nigerians, however, remain annoyed because they accepted </p><p>compulsory ICJ jurisdiction in the sixties while, they say, </p><p>Cameroon waited to do so until it was ready to file a case. </p><p>They see more studied calculation than goodwill in Yaounde\'s </p><p>behavior, and a decision in Cameroon\'s favor on key points in </p><p>the case magnifies their distrust.  We concur in Ould- </p><p>Abdallah\'s assessment, both that Obasanjo wants to resolve the </p><p>dispute with Cameroon peaceably and that he will be hard- </p><p>pressed to go further without a high-profile gesture from </p><p>Cameroon.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  ACTION REQUESTED:  That President Bush\'s response to </p><p>Biya explicitly urge him to pay a visit to Abuja before the </p><p>mid-April elections in order to give his Nigerian counterpart </p><p>the political cover he needs to take next steps, and that Biya </p><p>also be encouraged to engage Nigeria in the Lake Chad Basin </p><p>Commission.  END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>OTHER NEXT STEPS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Ould-Abdallah heard hopeful notes in Vice President </p><p>Atiku Abubakar\'s opening remarks.  The proposal to include </p><p>Equatorial Guinea in discussion about the demarcation of the </p><p>southern end of the maritime boundary bodes well for better </p><p>cooperation on resource management in the Gulf of Guinea.  The </p><p>call for "withdrawal of administrative and security personnel </p><p>of both countries in areas that are ceded to the other" hinted </p><p>at Nigerian willingness to let go of Bakassi, Ould-Abdallah </p><p>believed, cautioning once again that Nigeria\'s readiness to </p><p>stick with commitments might have to be tested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Ould-Abdallah clearly finds himself more at ease with </p><p>the Nigerian side.  He finds them more competent technically </p><p>and more engaged in the back-and-forth needed to discover the </p><p>foundations of compromise and to build them into fully-fledged </p><p>proposals.  His annoyance at Biya\'s detachment from the </p><p>process was also evident, as was his conviction that Biya </p><p>needed to practice the personal diplomacy traditional among </p><p>African Heads of State.  If the SYG\'s representative feels </p><p>this way, how much more so might the Nigerians, and how much </p><p>more useful even than Ould-Abdallah believes might be a visit </p><p>by Biya to Abuja.  Ould-Abdallah is right to be cautious when </p><p>the GON undertakes a commitment.  The solution is not </p><p>cynicism, however; it is to examine the proposed commitment </p><p>from every possible angle, avoiding exploitable gray areas. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  Obasanjo has told the Ambassador that he will not </p><p>meet with Biya again outside of the African Continent.  A Biya </p><p>visit to Abuja would build trust, and we believe, give </p><p>considerable impetus to peaceful resolution of the Bakassi </p><p>issue. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
