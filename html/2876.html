<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000886 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SEPT FOR INR/R, R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA, SA/PD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KMDR, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: Media Reaction: Ambassador Clarifies U.S. Goals Prior To </p><p>P.M. Deuba\'s May 7 Visit To Washington </p><p> </p><p>1.  "US Not Interested In Using Nepal As Military Base: </p><p>Malinowsky" </p><p> </p><p>Article, Kathmandu Post, (5/4): "Addressing a meeting organized by </p><p>the Confederation of Nepalese Industries, Ambassador Malinowski </p><p>clarified: "We do not want any defense base in Nepal, nor do we </p><p>want to use it as a springboard to jump against another country... </p><p>The U.S. interest in Nepal is to help protect democracy." </p><p> </p><p>Previously a number of opinion pieces in a number of publications </p><p>had speculated that the purpose of a military assessment team </p><p>visit to Nepal in April was to set the stage for the introduction </p><p>of U.S. troops into the country. </p><p> </p><p>2.   "Foreign Bogey Or Sincerity" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, Kathmandu Post, (5/6): "... U.S. Ambassador to Nepal </p><p>Michael E. Malinowski was forthright in dispelling these doubts </p><p>and fear as he said that America had no interest in having a </p><p>defense base or using the Himalayan Kingdom as a springboard </p><p>against China." </p><p> </p><p>3.   "PM\'s Visit Symbolic On Many Fronts" </p><p> </p><p>OpEd, Rising Nepal (5/4).  Nishchal Nath Pandey writes: "... </p><p>American assistance to the Nepalese government in order to fight </p><p>the menace of the Maoist insurgency will be invaluable and it is </p><p>further hoped that the visit will solidify the definitiveness that </p><p>is coming about in Nepal-US ties.  ...At the same time, the visit </p><p>is an indication that Nepal is not exclusively occupied with the </p><p>counter-insurgency operations that are currently underway.  We are </p><p>a mature democracy and issues of our children, cruxes that are </p><p>important for the upliftment of our export industries like carpet </p><p>and garment and vital industries such as the tourism industry are </p><p>still very much in our minds. </p><p> </p><p>4.   "Depressing Exports" </p><p> </p><p>Editorial, Kathmandu Post (5/4).  "A peep into the past four </p><p>months\' data reveal a 52 percent decline in garment exports to the </p><p>US, which alone absorbs around 85 percent of the total export... </p><p>The issue had been raised by The King and the Prime Minister when </p><p>Secretary Powell visited here four months ago...  Prime Minister </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Sher Bahadur Deuba during his visit to the US early next week will </p><p>no doubt seek the US and British assistance in the anti-terrorist </p><p>and developmental aspects.  An improved security situation will </p><p>attract more tourists.  Beside, this would also be the right </p><p>opportunity to seek US government\'s positive response to Nepal\'s </p><p>demand for a free access of its garments to their market..." </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
