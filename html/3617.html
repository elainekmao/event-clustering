(U) This is an action request.  See para. 6. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) SUMMARY: Under the patronage of King Abdullah, the </p><p>Ministry of Information Communications and Technology (MOICT) </p><p>and the Information Technology Association of Jordan (INTAJ) </p><p>are hosting an Information Communications Technology (ICT) </p><p>Forum September 30 - October 1 in Amman.  The Forum will </p><p>highlight opportunities for foreign investors in Jordan\'s </p><p>growing ICT industry, showcase the country\'s USAID-assisted </p><p>REACH initiative, a national strategy for developing the ICT </p><p>sector, and promulgate assessments of the sector\'s progress </p><p>to date.  Headlining this year\'s conference is Craig Barrett, </p><p>President and CEO of Intel Corporation.  Post requests </p><p>Washington agencies\' assistance in identifying potential </p><p>participants.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>AN IT EXTRAVAGANZA </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) INTAJ and the MOITC announced the agenda for this </p><p>fall\'s ICT Forum, to be held at the Grand Hyatt in Amman </p><p>September 30 - October 1.  In addition to the keynote address </p><p>by Barrett, Sun Microsystems\' John Gage will speak, and there </p><p>is a good possibility that AOL Time Warner\'s Steve Case and a </p><p>senior-level Microsoft representative will appear as well. </p><p>King Abdullah will hold a private VIP meeting with selected </p><p>dignitaries, and will address the conference opening day. </p><p>Minister of Information Communications and Technology Fawaz </p><p>Zu\'bi will open the conference with a welcome address and </p><p>will host a gala dinner September 30 at the Dead Sea. </p><p>Conference organizers also expect to announce some </p><p>significant IT projects involving American companies. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The agenda, available at www.jordanictforum.com, </p><p>includes panel discussions on the development of Jordan\'s IT </p><p>industry, Jordan as an investment destination, enabling IT </p><p>environment and infrastructure, human resources development, </p><p>and government support.  Roslyn Docktor, Vice President of </p><p>McConnell International, will present an assessment of </p><p>Jordan\'s "e-readiness".  Conference organizers will also </p><p>provide ample time and venues for networking and private </p><p>discussions. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>SPREAD THE WORD </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) At MOICT\'s request, we hosted a brainstorming session </p><p>August 27 on how to spread the word about the conference. </p><p>Commoff will prepare an International Market Insight Report </p><p>to help promote awareness of and participation in the event </p><p>by interested U.S. businesses.   USAID\'s AMIR program is </p><p>providing logistic and administrative support, and is sending </p><p>the invitations and arranging for accommodations. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Action Request: The ICT Forum will provide Jordan </p><p>with an opportunity to demonstrate its potential to be a </p><p>regional leader in IT and perhaps give foreign investment </p><p>here a much-needed boost.  The participation of such IT </p><p>luminaries as Barrett, Gage, and Case should lend the event </p><p>the gravitas it needs to attract investor interest. </p><p>Likewise, a favorable, public assessment of Jordan\'s IT </p><p>industry showing that the sector is on the right track, </p><p>coupled with some deliverables to be announced at the Forum, </p><p>can only inject some confidence into an economy that is </p><p>working hard to do the right thing in a difficult </p><p>neighborhood and challenging environment. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) We would appreciate Washington\'s advice and </p><p>assistance in spreading the word about this event to the U.S. </p><p>IT industry.  Input in developing a list of IT industry </p><p>associations with which INTAJ could work (both in promoting </p><p>this conference and establishing longer-term relationships) </p><p>would be particularly useful.  In addition, we encourage U.S. </p><p>government participation in the conference, both as potential </p><p>speakers and attendees.  We will be in touch with Commerce\'s </p><p>Technology Administration and State\'s International </p><p>Information and Communications Policy group (EB/CIP) to </p><p>follow up. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
