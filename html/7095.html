<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000629 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EPET, PREL, MOPS, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CONCERN FOR CRISIS IN THE DELTA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ABUJA 555 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During a March 26 evening meeting, </p><p>President Obasanjo, Ambassador Jeter and British High </p><p>Commissioner Philip Thomas discussed the ongoing </p><p>crisis in the oil-producing Niger Delta. Jeter and </p><p>Thomas expressed concern about the implications of a </p><p>continuing crisis on stability and on Nigeria\'s </p><p>economy. In the face of the violence that has already </p><p>taken place there, Jeter urged restraint by Nigerian </p><p>military units deployed to the area to contain the </p><p>Ijaw militants. Obasanjo inveighed against these </p><p>militants for killing several soldiers, commenting </p><p>that he would "do what I have to do as President" to </p><p>restore law and order.  Despite the air of toughness </p><p>and emotion that permeated this meeting, GON action </p><p>has been relatively measured thus far, consistent with </p><p>the line expressed in the Ambassador\'s earlier </p><p>discussion with the President (Reftel).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) During a late night March 26 discussion of the </p><p>upheaval affecting the key oil producing areas in </p><p>Delta State, Obasanjo explained that "troops with </p><p>armor" had been ordered into the area, and that the </p><p>Army and Navy would do everything necessary to ensure </p><p>security on Nigeria\'s waterways.  Accusing Ijaw </p><p>militants of killing four soldiers, Obasanjo condemned </p><p>them as "criminals," and said they would have to </p><p>answer for their misdeeds. As Head of State, it was </p><p>his duty to restore order. Jeter and Thomas expressed </p><p>concern that the conflict, if not properly handled, </p><p>could spill over into the entire Delta. Given the loss </p><p>of life and property destruction that has already </p><p>occurred, Ambassador Jeter counseled that the Nigerian </p><p>military show restraint and professionalism in </p><p>handling the local militants. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Clearly agitated and angered, Obasanjo bristled </p><p>that he would "do what I have to do as President." </p><p>Obasanjo asked rhetorically, "What should I do?"  He </p><p>then expressed his displeasure with the cutoff of </p><p>security assistance, something he did not do when </p><p>initially informed about the decision several weeks </p><p>ago. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Obasanjo rebuffed the notion that the violence </p><p>was politically motivated, asserting instead that </p><p>illegal oil bunkering was at the heart of the matter. </p><p>He claimed to have removed the top Naval commander in </p><p>Warri, as well as his deputy for collusion in the </p><p>illegal bunkering.  Obasanjo then stated that Delta </p><p>State Governor James Ibori had promised to apprehend </p><p>those responsible for killing the soldiers; if Ibori </p><p>did not produce the suspects, Obasanjo declared, "then </p><p>we will go in and find them." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Meeting Minister of Defense Danjuma the </p><p>following day, BHC Thomas was treated to an even more </p><p>emotional encore.  According to Thomas, Danjuma "blew </p><p>up."  "They killed four of our soldiers," Danjuma </p><p>repeatedly said, "and we must do what we have to do." </p><p>Danjuma chided Thomas by asking how he could offer </p><p>advice on the Delta region, "given what you are doing </p><p>in Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT: Obasanjo knows that he is in a </p><p>delicate position at the worst of all conceivable </p><p>times -- the eve of elections. On the one hand, he </p><p>wants to end this crisis quickly to get downstream oil </p><p>facilities back on line before the economy feels the </p><p>pinch. Taking strong action to punish the soldiers\' </p><p>killers and restore the authority of the army is added </p><p>incentive to talk tough and perhaps move quickly. </p><p>However, Obasanjo also knows that an aggressively </p><p>offensive strategy could produce another Odi or the </p><p>Zaki-Biam, a development that could dim his electoral </p><p>chances and further diminish Nigeria internationally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT CONT. This will be a complex dilemma </p><p>for Obasanjo. A key will be figuring out what exactly </p><p>the Ijaw militants want. After taking control of this </p><p>key oil producing area, it seems implausible that they </p><p>will drop their weapons and simply hand themselves </p><p>over to the authorities. More to the point, much </p><p>depends on the leeway Obasanjo feels he has to resolve </p><p>this issue. This has been a stiff challenge to GON </p><p>authority; the militants have bested some of his </p><p>soldiers and scared away international oil firms; by </p><p>possession of key oil installations, have held the </p><p>country\'s economy to ransom. Obasanjo cannot easily </p><p>swallow a deal that allows the culprits to walk away. </p><p>However, if the perpetrators know they will be </p><p>severely punished, they have little incentive to give </p><p>up. Resolution of crisis lies in Obasanjo\'s ability to </p><p>identify an out for both sides. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT CONT. Last, speculation is rife about </p><p>who is actually behind this crisis. For many, this </p><p>challenge looks too organized and strong to have been </p><p>entirely the work of local authors. Some people point </p><p>the finger at Delta Governor Ibori. Many others see </p><p>even more distant and powerful hands, including former </p><p>Head of State Babangida, in the mix. They believe </p><p>Babangida and his ilk stoked this turmoil as part of a </p><p>larger plan to create enough unrest that would scuttle </p><p>the elections. (Septel will provide a more detailed </p><p>analysis of these points.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
