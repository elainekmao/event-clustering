<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIRUT 00172 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINT, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:  CHRISTIAN CHURCHES BOMBED IN TRIPOLI </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ATTACKS AGAINST </p><p>CHRISTIAN INSTITUTIONS IN TRIPOLI DURING THE </p><p>PERIOD JANUARY 8-9.  TWO CHURCHES, MARONITE AND </p><p>GREEK ORTHODOX, WERE BOMBED ON TUESDAY, CAUSING </p><p>SERIOUS DAMAGE, WHILE ANOTHER GREEK ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCH AND AN EVANGELICAL INSTITUTION WERE DAMAGED </p><p>IN ATTACKS WEDNESDAY.  A CHRISTIAN CEMETARY WAS </p><p>ALSO BOMBED WEDNESDAY NIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  ISLAMIC UNIFICATION MOVEMENT (TAWHIID) </p><p>HAS ISSUED TWO CONSECUTIVE CONDEMNATIONS OF THE </p><p>ATTACKS, NOTING THAT TRIPOLI HAS TRADITIONALLY </p><p>BEEN AN EXAMPLE OF RELIGIOUS UNITY, AND DEPLORING </p><p>EFFORTS "TO FRIGHTEN THE CHRISTIANS OUT OF THE </p><p>CITY."  WEEKLY MEETING OF ISLAMIC DAR AL-FATWA </p><p>WEDNESDAY ALSO CONDEMNED THE BOMBINGS, AS DID </p><p>BRIG. OTHMAN OTHMAN, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF </p><p>INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES DURING A VISIT TO </p><p>TRIPOLI WEDNESDAY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  CHRISTIAN NOTABLE AND LEBANESE FORCES </p><p>CHARTER MEMBER, CHARLES MALIK, TOLD POLOFF THAT </p><p>FOUR CHRISTIANS HAVE, AS WELL, BEEN MURDERED ON </p><p>ROADS NEAR TRIPOLI, AND THAT CHRISTIAN RESIDENTS </p><p>OF AREA FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES.  HE SAID THAT </p><p>"LEBANESE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY" IS THINKING OF </p><p>PREPARING A DEMARCHE TO STATE DEPARTMENT ON </p><p>TRIPOLI VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENT (C):  AS ALWAYS IN BEIRUT, LIST OF </p><p>POSSIBLE PERPETRATORS OF THESE ATTACKS IS A LONG </p><p>ONE, BEGINNING WITH TAWHIID ITSELF.  MANY </p><p>OBSERVERS ATTRIBUTE BOMBINGS, WHICH COME SOON </p><p>AFTER RECENT DEPLOYMENT OF LAF INTO TRIPOLI </p><p>AS PART OF NORTHERN SECURITY PLAN, AS EFFORT </p><p>TO EMBARASS GOL (WHILE AT SAME TIME INTIMIDATING </p><p>CHRISTIANS).  ELABORATING ON THIS HYPOTHESIS, </p><p>CHRISTIAN LEBANESE EMBASSY EMPLOYEE FROM KOURA </p><p>REGION HAS TOLD US THAT MUCH BLAME IS BEING LAID </p><p>AT FEET OF STILL-ACTIVE COMMUNISTS IN TRIPOLI, </p><p>WITH RATIONALE BEING THAT LATTER ARE TRYING TO </p><p>DISRUPT SECURITY PLAN THERE AND PLACE THE BLAME </p><p>ON TAWHIID "PRINCE" SHA\'BAN, WHO RECENTLY </p><p>BOASTED IN A PUBLIC SPEECH THAT THE COMMUNISTS </p><p>HAD BEEN CRUSHED IN TRIPOLI.  A SIMILAR ARGUMENT, </p><p>HOWEVER, COULD BE MADE THAT TAWIID\'S MAIN RIVAL </p><p>IN TRIPOLI, THE ARAB DEMOCRATIC PARTY, IS </p><p>BEHIND BOMBINGS. </p><p> </p><p>BARTHOLOMEW </p><p></p></div>
