<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 000793 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA--MILLS/CHANG </p><p>USDOC 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/COBERG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EINV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: CBJ TAKES ACTION AS LOAN SCANDAL WINDS DOWN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) AMMAN 313 B) 02 AMMAN 687 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY: In the wake of last year\'s "Shemailah" </p><p>banking scandal involving unsecured bad loans by three </p><p>Jordanian banks (REF B), the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) has </p><p>assumed management of the two banks most weakened by the </p><p>losses.  The move signals a determination by the CBJ to use </p><p>newly-instituted minimum capital requirements to force </p><p>smaller banks with unhealthy balance sheets to merge.  It </p><p>also highlights the potential for greater challenges to the </p><p>sector in light of the same banks\' exposure to UN </p><p>Oil-For-Food Program contracts and the effects of even </p><p>isolated bank failures on the sector and the economy.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>THE HOUSECLEANING BEGINS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) According to CBJ officials, the CBJ dissolved the </p><p>Board of Directors at the Jordan Gulf Bank (JGB) and took </p><p>over the day-to-day operation of the bank on February 2. </p><p>This follows a similar action regarding the Philadelphia </p><p>Investment Bank (PIB) in late 2002.  The CBJ has also </p><p>recently referred the former chairman and general manager of </p><p>the PIB to the prosecutor general on suspicion of criminal </p><p>acts, most probably related to last year\'s Shemailah scandal. </p><p> Similarly to PIB, JGB will be run by an administrative </p><p>committee appointed by the CBJ.  CBJ Board member Thabet </p><p>Taher will head JGB\'s committee. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) As in the case of the PIB, the CBJ is looking to </p><p>merge the bank with another bank; according to the local </p><p>press, four local banks have expressed interest.  Dr. Mai </p><p>Khamis, the new Head of Banking Supervision at the CBJ, told </p><p>us that there was no intention to merge the two banks with </p><p>one another, as "the result would be one big weak bank </p><p>instead of two smaller weak banks."  Rather, successful </p><p>suitors for each of the banks would emerge from four banks </p><p>that have expressed interest.  Khamis expected the process to </p><p>take four to six months. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>A NEW TOOL </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) By using increased minimum capital requirements </p><p>instituted under the Banking Law approved last year, Khamis </p><p>said the CBJ is attempting to overcome the traditional </p><p>antipathy of smaller, family-run Jordanian banks to merge, </p><p>and to force the weaker small banks to combine with healthier </p><p>institutions.  She expects the new JD40 million ($28 million) </p><p>minimum capital requirement to push a number of smaller banks </p><p>to choose between merger and liquidation.  Khamis noted that </p><p>JGB failed to meet these requirements, and was greatly </p><p>weakened by its high exposure to the Shemailah scandal.  With </p><p>an eye to protecting depositors\' funds, the CBJ decided to </p><p>act.  (NOTE: According to Khamis, the investigation into the </p><p>Shemaileh case is continuing, but winding down.  The </p><p>Prosecutor General is currently questioning CBJ officials, a </p><p>process Khamis expects to end shortly.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Along the same lines, the Jordan National Bank </p><p>(JNB), the third bank exposed to the bad loans to Shemailah, </p><p>announced plans to raise its capital to JD 60 million via a </p><p>public subscription of 10 million shares (presently listed at </p><p>JD.94 per share on the Amman Stock Exchange).  8 million </p><p>shares had already been sold via private offering to the </p><p>Government of Kuwait, the Social Security Corporation, the </p><p>Mu\'asher Investment and Trading Company, and the Jordanian </p><p>Investment Center Company.  Khamis said of the three banks </p><p>most affected by the loan scandal, JNB was the strongest and </p><p>the most likely to survive. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Of Jordan\'s 21 banks, PIB and JGB are in the bottom </p><p>tier in terms of size.  Their combined assets of JD558 </p><p>million ($391 million) account for 2.3% of all assets in the </p><p>Jordanian banking sector.  The CBJ is clearly taking the </p><p>opportunity provided by the Shemailah scandal to force </p><p>consolidation in Jordan\'s over-crowded banking sector (to be </p><p>covered SEPTEL).  The moves also serve to heighten awareness </p><p>of the precarious health of a number of smaller Jordanian </p><p>banks, some with significant exposure to OFF contracts (such </p><p>as the Jordan National Bank) that face danger of collapse </p><p>should the contracts default as described in REF A.  (While </p><p>small in number and value relative to the sector as a whole, </p><p>OFF exposure is concentrated in a few banks.)  Coupled with </p><p>an expected short-term run on banks triggered by an outbreak </p><p>of war, default on OFF contracts due to inability to deliver </p><p>the goods in Iraq under current UN procedures could push some </p><p>of these banks over the edge, causing a potentially damaging </p><p>loss of confidence in Jordan\'s banking sector as a whole and </p><p>subsequent knock-on effects to larger banks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
