<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ABU DHABI 01208 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA DAS GNEHM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, ECON, IR, US </p><p>SUBJECT:  HARDLINERS CONTINUE ATTACK ON RAFSANJANI ON </p><p>          ECONOMIC PLANS, INSIST HOSTILITY TO AMERICANS </p><p>          MUST CONTINUE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) FBIS LONDON PM 2102110090 DTG 211100Z FEB 90 </p><p>-     (B) FBIS LONDON RD 2302161790 DTG 231617Z FEB 90 </p><p>-     (C) FBIS LONDON LD 2302164690 DTG 231646Z FEB 90 </p><p>-     (D) FBIS LONDON LD 2202111190 DTG 221111Z FEB 90 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p>- </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  MOHTASHEMI IS CONTINUING HIS DIRECT ATTACK </p><p>ON RAFSANJANI THROUGH THE FIVE-YEAR ECONOMIC PLAN.  HE </p><p>STRESSES THE NEED TO RELY ON FAITH AND MARTYRDOM AND TO </p><p>REJECT TECHNOLOGY AND DIPLOMACY AS WAYS OF DEALING WITH </p><p>THE WEST.  HE COUPLES THIS TO DEMANDS THAT "DEATH TO </p><p>AMERICA" REMAIN  A BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THE REVOLUTION. </p><p>ARDABILI ADDS FURTHER ATTACKS, AND BOTH ARE REINVIGORATING </p><p>THE CALLS FOR RUSHDIE\'S DEATH AND LINKING ANY WATERING </p><p>DOWN OF THIS POLICY WITH APPEASEMENT OF THE U.S. AND U.K. </p><p>WITH RAFSANJANI HAVING TO DEFEND HIMSELF ON THE ECONOMY </p><p>AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REVOLUTION IT IS UNLIKELY </p><p>THAT HE WOULD FIND THE MOMENT PROPITIOUS TO FIGHT ON A </p><p>SECOND FRONT AND TRY TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. </p><p>IN OUR VIEW, THIS IS THE CURRENT REALITY OF IRANIAN </p><p>POLITICS.  THE RECENT TEHRAN TIMES EDITORIAL (REF D) </p><p>CALLING FOR RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES HAS NEITHER BEEN </p><p>PICKED UP BY THE PERSIAN-LANGUAGE PRESS NOR ECHOED BY </p><p>RAFSANJANI.  WE DOUBT IT IS A SERIOUS INDICATOR OF </p><p>POLICY CHANGE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  IN AN EXTENSIVE INTERVIEW RUN IN KEYHAN HAVAI ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 7 (REF A), MAJLIS MEMBER AND FORMER INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTER MOHTASHEMI NEVER MENTIONS RAFSANJANI BY NAME </p><p>BUT LAYS DOWN CHALLENGES TO HIS PROGRAM.  MOHTASHEMI </p><p>BEGINS BY DENYING THAT ANY REEVALUATION OF THE </p><p>REVOLUTION IS NECESSARY; RATHER, IT IS BACKSLIDING FROM </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES WHICH HAS CAUSED IRAN\'S </p><p>WEAKNESS.  HE SAYS THAT WHEN IRAN DEPENDED ON HEZBOLLAH </p><p>AND MARTYRDOM IT SUCCEEDED; WHEN IT RELIED ON TECHNOLOGY </p><p>AND DIPLOMACY, IT FAILED. </p><p>- </p><p>4.  WITHOUT MENTIONING THE FIVE-YEAR PLAN DIRECTLY, </p><p>HE ATTACKS ITS BASIC DIRECTIONS, REPEATING CRITICISMS </p><p>MADE DURING THE MAJLIS DEBATES.  ONE OF HIS TARGETS IS </p><p>THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  "TODAY WE ARE AGAIN MOVING IN THE </p><p>WRONG DIRECTION."  PROFITS ARE BEING DIRECTED TO THE </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR.  "AS A RESULT, THE PROFITS WILL ONCE </p><p>AGAIN GO TO THE POCKETS OF A SPECIAL GROUP OF PEOPLE. </p><p>THE MASSES CANNOT BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM." </p><p>MOHTASHEMI WILL PROBABLY FIND SUPPORT FOR THIS ATTACK </p><p>SINCE PROFITEERS ARE BENEFITING FROM RAFSANJANI\'S FREE </p><p>MARKET POLICIES. </p><p>- </p><p>5.  ANOTHER TARGET IS THE PLAN\'S EMPHASIS ON INDUSTRIALI- </p><p>ZATION.  MOHTASHEMI ARGUES THIS WILL ONLY MAKE IRAN </p><p>DEPENDENT ON FOREIGNERS FOR PARTS AND MATERIALS.  THIS </p><p>IS A STRONG THEME IN A NATION WHICH BELIEVES OVER- </p><p>WHELMINGLY THAT THE HISTORY OF THE LAST 100 YEARS IS ONE </p><p>OF SUFFERING FROM FOREIGN DOMINATION, FIRST BRITISH AND </p><p>THEN AMERICAN.  MOHTASHEMI CALLS FOR A BASIC </p><p>REORIENTATION FROM FAVORING INDUSTRY TO FAVORING </p><p>AGRICULTURE AND SAYS THIS WAS KHOMEINI\'S COMMAND. </p><p>- </p><p>6.  HE DEALS AT LENGTH WITH THE NEED FOR HOSTILITY </p><p>TO AMERICA.  "DEATH TO AMERICA" IS A PRINCIPLE OF THE </p><p>IMAM.  SLOGANS ARE BASIC TO THE REVOLUTION.  IF THE </p><p>SLOGAN OF DEATH TO AMERICAN IS REMOVED, THE PEOPLE WILL </p><p>NOT RECOGNIZE THEIR ENEMY.  ANIMOSITY AND HATE MUST FIND </p><p>A PERMANENT PLACE IN PEOPLE\'S HEARTS.  WITHOUT </p><p>QUALIFICATION HE REJECTS RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>- </p><p>7.  MOHTASHEMI CRITICIZES THE AUTHORITIES FOR WEAKNESS </p><p>IN IMPLEMENTING THE DEATH DECREE ON SALMAN RUSHDIE, </p><p>THROUGH LACK OF DIRECT ACTION AND INADEQUATE THEOLOGICAL </p><p>DEFENSE OF THE DECREES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THE </p><p>RUSHDIE THEME IS PICKED UP AGAIN IN A FEBRUARY 23 SERMON </p><p>OF MUSAVI-ARDABILI (REF B), WHO ADDS, "THE ISSUE </p><p>CONCERNS AMERICA; THE ISSUE CONCERNS ENGLAND.  IT IS </p><p>ABOUT ATTEMPTS TO DELIVER BLOWS AT THE REVOLUTION." </p><p>- </p><p>8.  ARDABILI\'S SERMON IS ALSO NOTEWORTHY FOR ITS </p><p>COMPLETE ABSENCE OF MENTION OF RAFSANJANI AND KHAMENEI </p><p>ON AN OCCASION WHEN PRAISE OF THE RULERS IS TRADITIONAL. </p><p>ARDABILI DOES FIND ANOTHER WAY OF INDIRECTLY ATTACKING </p><p>RAFSANJANI IN DISCUSSING THE THREAT TO IRAN IMPLICIT </p><p>IN THE BREAKUP OF THE COMMUNIST EMPIRE.  HE STATES THAT </p><p>THE WEST IS HOPEFUL OF DEPOLARIZING THE WORLD, "THE </p><p>WOLVES HAVE SHARPENED THEIR CLAWS, GLOBAL ECONOMIC CENTERS </p><p>HAVE DRAWN UP CERTAIN PLANS."  THIS CONTRASTS WITH </p><p>RSFSANJANI\'S FEBRUARY 20 PRESENTATION OF THE BUDGET BILL </p><p>(REF C), IN WHICH HE SAW DANGERS IN THE CHANGES IN EUROPE </p><p>BUT ALSO A POSSIBILITY OF POSITIVE RESULTS FOR NATIONS </p><p>"LIKE US WHO WISH TO BE INDEPENDENT."  ARDABILI IS UNMOVED </p><p>BY RAFSANJANI\'S CAUTION AGAINST "ONE-SIDED JUDGMENT." </p><p>- </p><p>9.  THESE PUBLIC DECLARATIONS BY SUPPORTERS OF THE MOST </p><p>EXTREME POSITIONS OF THE LATE AYATOLLAH LAY DOWN AN </p><p>EXTENSIVE CHALLENGE TO RAFSANJANI.  THEY SUGGEST THAT </p><p>PASSAGE BY THE MAJLIS OF THE ECONOMIC PLAN WILL NOT GIVE </p><p>HIM AN EASIER ROAD THAN HE HAS HAD.  THE BUREAUCRATIC </p><p>DISORGANIZATION OF IRAN IS LIKELY TO PROVIDE AMPLE </p><p>FAILURES IN THE PLAN\'S AMBITIOUS GOALS.  RAFSANJANI </p><p>MUST EXPECT THAT EVERY SETBACK WILL BE UTILIZED BY </p><p>HIS OPPOSITION TO PROCLAIM THAT THE "MASSES" ARE NOT </p><p>BEING AIDED AND THAT IRAN IS SINKING DEEPER INTO FOREIGN </p><p>DEPENDENCE.  WITH SUCH A BATTLE ON HIS HANDS, IT IS MOST </p><p>UNLIKELY THAT RAFSANJANI WILL SEE THIS AS A SENSIBLE TIME </p><p>TO UNDERTAKE ANY WARMING TO THE UNITED STATES -- A </p><p>SECOND, AND RELATED, AREA ON WHICH THE HARDLINERS HAVE </p><p>STAKED OUT THEIR OPPOSITION AND WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN </p><p>THE BANNER OF THE DEPARTED IMAM. </p><p>- </p><p>10.  THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TEHRAN TIMES EDITORIAL OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 22 (REF D) CALLING FOR THE RELEASE OF THE </p><p>HOSTAGES IN LEBANON DOES NOT STRIKE US AS A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>BASIS FOR ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS.  THE PAPER IS PRIMARILY </p><p>A VEHICLE FOR SPEAKING TO THE WEST, NOT TO THE FORCES </p><p>THAT MAKE POLICY IN IRAN.  THE EDITORIAL, AS FAR AS WE </p><p>ARE AWARE, HAS NEITHER BEEN PICKED UP BY THE PERSIAN </p><p>PRESS NOR DISCUSSED IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS.  RAFSANJANI\'S </p><p>COMMENTS ON THE FOREIGN SITUATION BEFORE THE MAJLIS </p><p>(REF C) LIKEWISE MAKE NO MENTION OF THE HOSTAGES.  WHAT </p><p>HE DOES DO IS TO REJECT EXPLICITLY COMPROMISE WITH THE </p><p>WEST, ALTHOUGH HE NOTES THAT IRAN COULD IMPROVE ITS </p><p>ECONOMIC CONDITION IF "WE WERE PREPARED TO COMPROMISE </p><p>WITH THE ARROGANT POWERS OF THE WORLD." </p><p>- </p><p>11.  IRANIANS ARE ADEPT AT GOING IN ONE DIRECTION WHILE </p><p>KEEPING OTHERS OFF BALANCE BY THROWING OFF TANTALIZING </p><p>HINTS OF DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES IN FORA WHICH HOLD NO </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IRANIAN POLICY MAKERS.  WE BELIEVE </p><p>THE TEHRAN TIMES EDITORIAL IS ANOTHER SUCH RED HERRING. </p><p>THE PUBLIC CHALLENGES OF MOHTASHEMI AND ARDABILI </p><p>REPRESENT THE REALITY WITH WHICH RAFSANJANI WILL HAVE </p><p>TO COPE FOR SOME TIME TO COME. </p><p> </p><p>WALKER </p><p></p></div>
