<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 002133 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY APRIL 1:  MARKETS AWAIT IMF GOOD </p><p>NEWS EXPECTED THIS WEEK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2094 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Quiet; Awaiting IMF Good News </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Transactions volumes in Turkish financial markets </p><p>were very low  on April 1 am.  T-bill yields were unchanged </p><p>at 65 percent compounded, the lira appreciated slightly to TL </p><p>1,702,000, and the Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 index was up 1 </p><p>percent.   Stock market transaction volume has averaged at </p><p>about $100 million per day over the past week (normal average </p><p>daily volume is nearly $500 million).  Traders told us </p><p>markets are awaiting news on the IMF Fourth Review.  There is </p><p>also some  expectation in the local markets of a U.S. loan </p><p>package of $8.5 billion, with the first tranche coming in the </p><p>May/June time-frame, though TV news analysts are reporting on </p><p>April 1 am of concerns in Congress that may reduce this </p><p>package for Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF and World Bank Updates </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) IMF resrep told us Deputy Managing Director Krueger </p><p>received the LOI for review on the evening of March 31.  The </p><p>Turks had resolved the few remaining issues: they closed the </p><p>investigation into BRSA\'s intervention of Pamukbank; they </p><p>agreed to enhanced quarterly monitoring of the state banks by </p><p>BRSA bank auditors (this became necessary after the GOT </p><p>replaced the state bank board, reftel).  Resrep said there </p><p>were no other significant changes to the final LOI.  If IMF </p><p>senior management approve the LOI April 1, then the Turks </p><p>would plan to sign it April 2.  MinState Babacan is planning </p><p>a press conference to announce the signing, and would also </p><p>announce the revised schedule for eliminating redundant job </p><p>in the state enterprises (a 4th Review prior action).  IMF </p><p>staff also expect Babacan to press the Fund to announce a 4th </p><p>Review board date this week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Asked about Deputy PM Sener\'s press comments this </p><p>week promising a rescheduling of Ziraat Bank loans to </p><p>farmers, IMF resrep said he saw those comments and they were </p><p>nothing new.  This is a long-term project of the AKP.  If the </p><p>loans were rescheduled on commercial terms, that was okay; if </p><p>AKP plans a wholesale rescheduling of a class of loans, that </p><p>would contradict an LOI undertaking, and the IMF would </p><p>object. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) World Bank economist Parks told us April 1 that the </p><p>Bank had extended its pending adjustment loans to Turkey that </p><p>were due to expire March 31.  The revised 2003 disbursement </p><p>schedule over 2003 is:  $550 million in June; $825 million in </p><p>December.  (Comment:  One of the structural conditions for </p><p>the World Bank\'s June disbursement is privatization of </p><p>state-owned Vakifbank.  The World Bank has agreed to accept </p><p>Vakifbank\'s sale to its employees\' pension fund as meeting </p><p>this condition.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOT Proposes Voluntary "Sacrifice" Fund To Help Pay Debt </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Following the March 31 Cabinet meeting, GOT </p><p>spokesman Cicek announced that work was underway to create an </p><p>"Economic Sacrifice Fund," chaired by MinState Babacan, who </p><p>would publicize his efforts within one week.  The Fund would </p><p>allow Turkish citizens and corporations to donate money to </p><p>help the Government meet debt payments.  Last week PM Erdogan </p><p>told the press of a similar effort, in which each citizen </p><p>would be asked to voluntarily contribute $100 to help the GOT </p><p>meet debt payments.  The April 1 Radikal newspaper (low </p><p>circulation, aimed at intelligentsia) ridiculed what it </p><p>called "dream-like" solutions to Turkey\'s debt problems. </p><p>Bender Securities stock market analyst Golkan was more </p><p>direct, calling this project "horse-s." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
