<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002738 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ELAB, EPET, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OIL WORKERS\' STRIKE CAUSES SHORT-LIVED </p><p>GASOLINE SHORTAGES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2567 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. PENGASSAN, Nigeria\'s white collar oil and gas union, in </p><p>cooperation with the blue collar Nigerian Union of Petroleum </p><p>and Natural Gas (NUPENG), held a one day "warning strike" on </p><p>September 23 to protest the planned privatization of certain </p><p>downstream operations of the Nigerian National Petroleum </p><p>Corporation (NNPC) (Reftel).  In solidarity, oil tanker </p><p>drivers, who are NUPENG workers, stopped transporting </p><p>gasoline from September 20-23.  The strike was scheduled to </p><p>last through Tuesday, September 24, but was called off </p><p>earlier after the reported intervention of Minister of </p><p>Employment and Productivity Alhaji Musa Gwadabe.  In Lagos, </p><p>most gasoline stations had sufficient reserves to continue </p><p>pumping gasoline during the strike, though some refused to do </p><p>so for fear of NUPENG reprisals. In other parts of Nigeria, </p><p>the impact was more severe, with lines at the pumps reaching </p><p>more than one kilometer in Abuja.  There have been no reports </p><p>of violence associated with the strikes, and as of September </p><p>25, lines at fueling stations were returning to more typical </p><p>lengths of ten to twenty cars deep.  Comment: The unions </p><p>intended the warning strike to scare the GON into shelving </p><p>plans to privatize NNPC\'s refineries. If the unions cannot </p><p>secure an agreement they find satisfactory, they are likely </p><p>to follow through on their threats to strike again. </p><p>Privatization does not enjoy much domestic support.  With </p><p>elections quickly approaching, the President will almost </p><p>certainly postpone privatization plans for fear of the </p><p>political damage that would be caused by an extended fuel </p><p>strike. End comment. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
