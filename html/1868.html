(C) ON AUGUST 6, SENATE STAFFDEL, LED BY GARRETT </p><p>GRIGSBY, MET WITH THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02387  01 OF 02  101141Z </p><p>(MDC) LEADERSHIP IN THEIR NEW DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS. </p><p>MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WAS ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE, NATIONAL COORDINATOR </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ISAAC MAPOSA, INCOMING ELECTION COORDINATOR NOMORE </p><p>SIBANDA, PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS SECRETARY FORMAN FOTO, </p><p>AND PRESIDENTIAL ASSISTANT GANDI MUDZINGWA.  CHARGE </p><p>AUBREY HOOKS AND POLOFFS ACCOMPANIED STAFFDEL TO THE </p><p>MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>THE SITUATION </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AFTER INITIAL PLEASANTRIES, TSVANGIRAI OPENED BY </p><p>SAYING THE CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE IS </p><p>"UNPRECEDENTED" AND THE COUNTRY IS SLIDING INTO </p><p>DICTATORSHIP.  HE OUTLINED THE EVENTS LEADING TO THE </p><p>FORMATION OF THE MDC AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S HEAVY-HANDED </p><p>RESPONSE IN ATTEMPTING TO SUPPRESS THE OPPOSITION.  EVEN </p><p>AFTER THE MDC WON 57 OUT OF 120 ELECTED SEATS IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT -- AN ELECTION IN WHICH THE MDC WAS </p><p>SHORTCHANGED, HE ADDED -- THE GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES </p><p>TO DEAL WITH THE MDC AS A LEGITIMATE OPPOSITION PARTY. </p><p>TSVANGIRAI ARGUED THAT THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>ELECTION WILL BE THE MOST CRITICAL IN ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>HISTORY.  A FREE AND FAIR ENVIRONMENT IS CRUCIAL TO ITS </p><p>LEGITIMACY; IF THE ELECTION IS FRAUDULENT, ZIMBABWE </p><p>COULD "GO OVER THE PRECIPICE." </p><p> </p><p>THE BILL </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02387  01 OF 02  101141Z </p><p>3.  (C) ON THE ISSUE OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND </p><p>ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA), TSVANGIRAI AGREED WITH </p><p>THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE BILL HAS BEEN FORMULATED, BUT </p><p>HE FEARED THAT IT WOULD BE "POLITICIZED AS A SANCTIONS </p><p>BILL" BY THE GOVERNMENT.  HE SAID THAT THE MDC CANNOT </p><p>TELL THE U.S. HOW TO DRAFT THE LEGISLATION, BUT OPINED </p><p>THAT BROAD ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ARE "NOT AN OPTION" IN THE </p><p>CURRENT DETERIORATING ECONOMY.  THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS </p><p>"GIVEN HOPE TO ZIMBABWE," AND HAS FOCUSED MUCH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION ON THE COUNTRY, WHICH IT NEEDS </p><p>TO GO IN A NEW DIRECTION, HE REMARKED. </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS WILL BE CRUCIAL </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) ON THE ISSUE OF SENDING INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS </p><p>FOR NEXT YEAR\'S ELECTION, THE MDC PRESIDENT SAID THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST INSIST ON THEM, EVEN IF THE </p><p>GOZ OBJECTS AND CREATES OBSTACLES TO THEIR ARRIVAL. </p><p>ISAAC MAPOSA ADDED THAT THE U.S. SHOULD NOT TRY TO SEND </p><p>NDI, IRI, OR OTHER NGOS AS OBSERVERS BECAUSE THEY WILL </p><p>NOT BE ACCREDITED.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT OFFICIAL </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE USG, SUCH AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS </p><p>OR STATE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES, BE SENT AS THEY WILL BE </p><p>ACCREDITED IN THE END.  ONLY ACCREDITED OBSERVERS CAN </p><p>ENTER POLLING PLACES AND TRAVEL FREELY FROM PLACE TO </p><p>PLACE, MAPOSA NOTED.  THEY SHOULD ALSO COME A FEW TIMES </p><p>SEVERAL MONTHS AHEAD OF THE ELECTION BECAUSE THEY WILL </p><p>NOT LIKELY SEE ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY ON THE </p><p>POLLING DAYS.  EVEN A MONTH IN ADVANCE, THE CAMPAIGN </p><p>WILL BASICALLY BE OVER.  THE MDC PRESIDENT REMARKED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02387  01 OF 02  101141Z </p><p>THE PRESENCE OF OBSERVERS BEFOREHAND WILL GIVE </p><p>ZIMBABWEANS HOPE AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO GO OUT AND VOTE </p><p>ON ELECTION DAY.  WHEN ASKED IF SOUTH AFRICA PLANNED TO </p><p>SEND OBSERVERS, TSVANGIRAI THOUGHT IT WOULD.  SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA SENT A PARLIAMENTARY OBSERVER MISSION FOR LAST </p><p>YEAR\'S ELECTIONS.  A NUMBER OF TRADE UNIONS AND NGOS </p><p>FROM SOUTH AFRICA WENT AS WELL, BUT MAPOSA BELIEVED </p><p>THESE WOULD BE REFUSED ACCREDITATION THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) TSVANGIRAI CONTINUED, SAYING ZIMBABWE ALSO NEEDS </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO IMPROVE ITS ELECTORAL PROCESS, BECAUSE </p><p>ANYTHING LESS THAN MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY IN THE PROCESS </p><p>WILL ONLY AID THE RULING PARTY.  THE WEST SHOULD HELP IN </p><p>ENSURING THAT THE 1.5 MILLION ZIMBABWEANS LIVING OUTSIDE </p><p>THE COUNTRY ARE NOT DISENFRANCHISED AS THE GOZ IS </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO DO.  IT\'S NO SECRET THAT MOST OF THOSE WHO </p><p>HAVE LEFT ZIMBABWE ARE NOT SUPPORTERS OF THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>AND IT IS IN THE GOZ\'S INTEREST TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO </p><p>MECHANISM FOR THEM TO VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6460 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02387  02 OF 02  101141Z </p><p>ACTION H-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    DS-00    TEDE-00  SS-00    DSCC-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /001W </p><p>                  ------------------108420  101141Z /38 </p><p>R 101138Z AUG 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9449 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002387 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/10/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: GRIGSBY STAFFDEL MEETS WITH MDC </p><p>LEADERSHIP </p><p> </p><p>DON\'T LET THE GOZ OFF THE HOOK </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) WELSHMAN NCUBE OPINED THAT IN ITS DEALINGS WITH </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA AND OTHER SADC STATES, THE U.S. SHOULD MAKE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02387  02 OF 02  101141Z </p><p>CLEAR THAT IT WILL NOT BE "BUSINESS AS USUAL" WITH </p><p>ZIMBABWE IF IT HOLDS A FRAUDULENT ELECTION.  IT MUST </p><p>ALSO MAKE CLEAR THAT A COUP D\'ETAT WILL NOT BE </p><p>ACCEPTABLE, EITHER.  NCUBE STATED THAT ZANU-PF IS </p><p>PREPARING TO GO TO WAR IF THE MDC WINS THE ELECTION, AND </p><p>THAT THERE ARE MANY ZIMBABWEANS WHO WOULD RATHER STARVE </p><p>THAN RISK GOING BACK TO WAR. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY HELP </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) TSVANGIRAI STATED THAT THE MDC DOES NOT PLAN TO </p><p>HOLD ANY MORE PUBLIC RALLIES UNTIL THE DATE OF THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS ANNOUNCED.  PARTICIPANTS WILL </p><p>JUST BE TARGETS OF REGIME-SPONSORED VIOLENCE, HE </p><p>LAMENTED.  AS FOR THE MDC\'S OWN SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS, </p><p>TSVANGIRAI NOTED THAT IT HAS ITS OWN MECHANISMS IN </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PLACE, AND IT IS TRYING TO INCREASE THE QUALITY AND </p><p>NUMBERS IN ITS SECURITY APPARATUS.  THE MDC SOMETIMES </p><p>EVEN INFORMS THE POLICE OF ITS MOVEMENTS AND DEMANDS </p><p>ESCORTS, GAMBLING THAT IT WILL GET THEM AT LEAST SOME OF </p><p>THE TIME.  WHEN ASKED WHAT THE U.S. CAN DO TO HELP, </p><p>MAPOSA STATED THAT THE U.S. MAY BE LIMITED BY ZIMBABWE\'S </p><p>RESTRICTIVE POLITICAL PARTIES FINANCE ACT, BUT AN </p><p>ARMORED CAR FOR TSVANGIRAI IS ESSENTIAL, AND RADIOS, </p><p>BULLET-PROOF VESTS, PRINTING MATERIALS, AND A SATELLITE </p><p>COMMUNICATION PLATFORM ARE ALSO NEEDED.  GRIGSBY POINTED </p><p>OUT THAT THERE IS A U.S. LAW THAT PERMITS SECURITY </p><p>TRAINING FOR FOREIGN NATIONALS.  GRIGSBY SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>THE MDC, EVEN THE RULING PARTY, COULD BENEFIT FROM SUCH </p><p>TRAINING.  TSVANGIRAI APPEARED VERY RECEPTIVE TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02387  02 OF 02  101141Z </p><p>IDEA AND SAID HE WOULD BE IN TOUCH TO FIND OUT MORE </p><p>ABOUT IT. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) THE MEETING WAS VERY CORDIAL AND TSVANGIRAI </p><p>DELIVERED HIS POINTS IN A CONFIDENT AND REASONED MANNER, </p><p>WITH AN EYE TOWARD ELICITING GREATER SUPPORT FROM THE </p><p>U.S.  HIS DEPUTIES WERE ALSO WELL PREPARED WITH SPECIFIC </p><p>IDEAS ON HOW THE U.S. COULD AID THE MDC IN ITS CAUSE. </p><p>THE MDC IS CLEARLY MORE FOCUSED THAN IT WAS AT THE </p><p>BEGINNING OF THE YEAR ON WHAT IS NEEDED TO OVERCOME </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGES AS INCUMBENT. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) THIS CABLE WAS NOT CLEARED BY STAFFDEL BEFORE </p><p>ITS DEPARTURE FROM HARARE. </p><p> </p><p>HOOKS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
