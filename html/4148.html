QS MEMBERS QUICKLY </p><p>RESPONDED BY CANCELING THEIR DEMONSTRATION, WHILE THE AOUNIST </p><p>FREE PATRIOTIC MOVEMENT VOWED TO CARRY ON WITH ITS PLANS TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE DESPITE THE BAN.  MURR SAID HIS DECISION WAS </p><p>BASED ON THE NEED TO MAINTAIN CIVIL PEACE DUE TO THE </p><p>"REGIONAL SITUATION" AND TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF PARIS II. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  IN A MOVE AGAINST THE OPPOSITION, INTERIOR MINISTER </p><p>ELIAS MURR DECIDED ON OCTOBER 30 TO BAN ALL OCTOBER 31 </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS, INCLUDING QS\'S DEMONSTRATION, THE ISLAMIC </p><p>GATHERING\'S COUNTER-DEMONSTRATION AND ALL OTHER SCHEDULED FOR </p><p>THIS DATE.  MURR JUSTIFIED HIS DECISION ON THE BASIS OF </p><p>MAINTAINING CIVIL STABILITY AT A TIME WHEN THE REGIONAL </p><p>SITUATION IS VOLATILE AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF </p><p>THE UPCOMING PARIS II INTERNATIONAL DONOR\'S CONFERENCE. </p><p>DESPITE REPORTED DISAGREEMENT WITHIN QS ON WHETHER TO GO </p><p>AHEAD WITH THE DEMONSTRATION, QS ACTED QUICKLY TO CANCEL THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATION AND AVOID ARRESTS.  (COMMENT:  THE DECISION TO </p><p>CANCEL THE QS DEMONSTRATION ONCE THE GOL DENIED PERMISSION TO </p><p>PROTEST WAS ALMOST GUARANTEED.  QS LEADERS ARE ALREADY </p><p>NERVOUS ABOUT THE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS OF OPPOSITION </p><p>MEMBERS FOR "CONTACT WITH THE ISRAELI ENEMY" AND WERE NOT </p><p>LIKELY TO PUT THEMSELVES IN THE LINE OF FIRE OF THE INTERNAL </p><p>SECURITY FORCES (ISF).  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  THE FREE PATRIOTIC MOVEMENT, COMPRISED OF SUPPORTERS </p><p>OF EXILE GENERAL MICHEL AOUN, LIVED UP TO ITS PROMISE TO </p><p>DEMONSTRATE DESPITE THE BAN.  APPROXIMATELY 300 PEOPLE </p><p>DEMONSTRATED WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE INFORMATION </p><p>UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN FANAR, A VILLAGE NEAR BEIRUT, THE </p><p>AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 31.  FOLLOWING THE DEMONSTRATIONS, </p><p>PROTESTERS ATTEMPTED TO CONGREGATE IN THE STREETS BUT WERE </p><p>STOPPED BY THE ISF.  RSO SOURCES REPORT THAT ROCKS AND OTHER </p><p>OBJECTS WERE THROWN AT POLICE BUT AS YET WE HAVE NO </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT ANY ARRESTS.  NO OTHER DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>OCCURRED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT.  THE SAGA, WHICH BEGAN WITH THE CONTESTED </p><p>METN ELECTIONS, FOLLOWED BY THE MARONITE CONFERENCE IN LOS </p><p>ANGELES, THE CLOSURE OF MTV, AND THE DISINTEGRATION OF </p><p>ATTEMPTED RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN PRESIDENT LAHOUD AND THE QS, </p><p>CONTINUES UNABATED.  WHAT MANY BELIEVE STARTED AS A FAMILY </p><p>FEUD HAS ENGAGED THE ENTIRE NATION AND LED TO A RISE IN </p><p>SECTARIAN TENSIONS.  MURR\'S JUSTIFICATION ON THE GROUNDS OF </p><p>REGIONAL INSTABILITY AND PARIS II IS THIN AND MORE </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES REMAIN FOR THE ISSUE TO COME TO A HEAD.  THE QS </p><p>WILL MEET NOVEMBER 7 TO DECIDE ITS NEXT MOVE.  IN THE </p><p>MEANTIME, MTV LAWYERS HAVE MADE ANOTHER APPEAL OF THE </p><p>STATION\'S PERMANENT CLOSURE.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BATTLE </p><p></p></div>
