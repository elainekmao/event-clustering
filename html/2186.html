(U) IN ITS NOVEMBER 8-14 EDITION, THE INDEPENDENT </p><p>"FINANCIAL GAZETTE" IN A SPECIAL INSERT PUBLISHED THE </p><p>RESULTS OF A NATIONWIDE OPINION SURVEY IT COMMISSIONED </p><p>TO DETERMINE SUPPORT FOR ZIMBABWE\'S LEADING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>CANDIDATES.  THE RAW UNWEIGHTED DATA SHOW THAT 33.5 </p><p>PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS PLAN TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE, 30 PERCENT INTEND TO VOTE FOR MDC PRESIDENT </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, WHILE, SIGNIFICANTLY, 31.3 PERCENT </p><p>ARE STILL UNDECIDED; 5.2 PERCENT DO NOT PLAN TO VOTE. </p><p>THE UNWEIGHTED DATA ARE BIASED IN FAVOR OF MUGABE </p><p>BECAUSE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE REFUSED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE SURVEY OUT OF FEAR OF RULING PARTY </p><p>REPRISALS, ACCORDING TO THE "GAZETTE" ARTICLES.  WHEN </p><p>THE DATA IS WEIGHTED TO REMOVE THOSE RESPONDENTS WHO ARE </p><p>UNDECIDED AND WHO DO NOT INTEND TO VOTE, THEY SHOW THAT </p><p>52.9 PERCENT OF THE ELECTORATE WOULD VOTE FOR TSVANGIRAI </p><p>AND 47.1 PERCENT WOULD VOTE FOR MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>"SMALL VICTORY" FOR MDC </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) THE "GAZETTE" POLL SHOWS THAT AFTER WEIGHING THE </p><p>RESULTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MDC SUPPORTERS WHO REFUSED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE, THE MDC\'S SUPPORT HAS GROWN IN ALL </p><p>PROVINCES SINCE THE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, EXCEPT </p><p>IN BULAWAYO, WHERE ZANU-PF PICKED UP SOME SUPPORT.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, IN THE ZANU-PF STRONGHOLD OF MASHONALAND </p><p>CENTRAL, 28.8 PERCENT OF THE ELECTORATE PLANS TO VOTE </p><p>FOR TSVANGIRAI, UP FROM THE 20 PERCENT OF THE VOTES THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03398  01 OF 02  141508Z </p><p>MDC RECEIVED IN 2000, ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY. </p><p>IMPORTANTLY, HOWEVER, SUPPORT FOR MUGABE REMAINS ABOVE </p><p>50 PERCENT IN ALL THREE MASHONALAND PROVINCES.  IN THE </p><p>KEY BATTLEGROUND PROVINCE OF MASVINGO, MUGABE RETAINS </p><p>THE UPPERHAND WITH 56.6 PERCENT OF VOTERS BACKING HIM </p><p>COMPARED TO 43.4 PERCENT FOR TSVANGIRAI.  SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE MDC HAS GROWN SLIGHTLY IN HARARE AND THE </p><p>MATABELELAND PROVINCES.  IN BULAWAYO, THE "GAZETTE" </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT ZANU-PF\'S INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE </p><p>EXCLUSION OF INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES FROM THE SURVEY. </p><p>BULAWAYO HAD A LARGE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES IN </p><p>2000, AND MOST OF THEIR SUPPORTERS DECIDED TO THROW </p><p>THEIR WEIGHT BEHIND ZANU-PF RATHER THAN THE MDC. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON NOVEMBER 8, POLOFF SPOKE TO PROFESSOR </p><p>MASIPULA SITHOLE, A UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE LECTURER, </p><p>COLUMNIST, AND DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION.  SITHOLE CHARACTERIZED THE "GAZETTE" SURVEY AS </p><p>"A SMALL VICTORY FOR THE MDC."  THE RESULTS OF THE 2000 </p><p>REFERENDUM AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WERE NARROW -- </p><p>AND THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL BE AS WELL -- SO </p><p>ANY GAIN IN SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE MDC\'S CHANCES, </p><p>SITHOLE OPINED.  HE STATED THAT THE FIVE BY-ELECTIONS OF </p><p>THE LAST YEAR BROKE NO NEW GROUND FOR EITHER PARTY.  A </p><p>CRITICAL FACTOR IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL BE </p><p>VOTER TURNOUT.  IT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN LOW (45-50 </p><p>PERCENT) IN PRESIDENTIAL POLLS, BUT IS LIKELY TO BE MUCH </p><p>HIGHER THIS TIME AROUND, A FACTOR THAT FAVORS THE MDC, </p><p>HE STATED.  HIS INSTITUTE IS CURRENTLY TABULATING THE </p><p>RESULTS OF ITS OWN SURVEY (1800 RESPONDENTS), WHICH </p><p>FOCUSED ON VOTER APATHY AND VOTER TURNOUT.  THE RESULTS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03398  01 OF 02  141508Z </p><p>SHOULD BE RELEASED IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS, HE SAID.  THE </p><p>RESPECTED HELEN SUZMAN FOUNDATION, WHICH CONDUCTED THREE </p><p>IMPORTANT SURVEYS IN ZIMBABWE LAST YEAR, IS ALSO DUE TO </p><p>RELEASE ANOTHER ONE BY THE END OF THE MONTH, SITHOLE </p><p>NOTED. </p><p> </p><p>POLL METHODOLOGY </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE "GAZETTE" SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT BY THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT MARKETING RESEARCH ORGANIZATION TARGET </p><p>RESEARCH -- BASED IN SOUTH AFRICA -- BETWEEN AUGUST 17 </p><p>AND SEPTEMBER 28.  SITHOLE REMARKED THAT HE DOES NOT </p><p>KNOW TARGET RESEARCH WELL, BUT HE HAS HEARD THEY HAVE A </p><p>GOOD REPUTATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.  ITS RESEARCHERS </p><p>POLLED 3,013 PEOPLE NATIONWIDE -- THE LARGEST SURVEY OF </p><p>ITS KIND TO DATE -- AND THE RESULTS HAD A 2.7 PERCENT </p><p>MARGIN OF ERROR.  THE RESULTS WERE WEIGHTED AND </p><p>TABULATED ACCORDING TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING GENDER, </p><p>ETHNICITY, AGE GROUP, EDUCATION, AND URBAN/RURAL </p><p>LOCATION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT: THE RACE WILL BE CLOSE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5236 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03398  02 OF 02  141508Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  USNW-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PC-01 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /008W </p><p>                  ------------------3E1C42  141509Z /38 </p><p>P 141424Z NOV 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0272 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 003398 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/14/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW ZIMBABWE SURVEY PORTENDS CLOSE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03398  02 OF 02  141508Z </p><p>5.  (C) BEFORE PUTTING TOO MUCH STOCK IN THIS POLL, ONE </p><p>MUST CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING CAVEATS.  WE ARE UNABLE TO </p><p>PROVIDE MORE THAN A LAYMAN\'S ASSESSMENT OF EITHER THE </p><p>METHODOLOGY OR THE BONA FIDES OF TARGET RESEARCH.  THE </p><p>QUESTIONS USED BY THE POLLSTERS, WHICH IN THEMSELVES CAN </p><p>SKEW THE RESULTS, WERE NOT MADE AVAILABLE IN THE </p><p>PUBLISHED RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, THE "GAZETTE" CLAIMS </p><p>THAT IN 1999 MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY NAMED TARGET </p><p>RESEARCH ONE OF SIX "OUTSTANDING RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>IN EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA," A CLAIM THAT IS </p><p>APPARENTLY UNFOUNDED.  MOREOVER, THE "GAZETTE" APPEARS </p><p>TO ASSUME THAT THE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT </p><p>RESPOND TO THE SURVEY WOULD SUPPORT THE MDC.  THE SURVEY </p><p>DID NOT MAKE CLEAR HOW THE POLLSTERS DETERMINED WHO IS </p><p>AND WHO IS NOT AN MDC SUPPORTER AMONG THE </p><p>NONRESPONDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: ALTHOUGH SURVEY STATISTICS </p><p>CAN BE MANIPULATED TO SHOW ALMOST ANYTHING, THE </p><p>"GAZETTE" POLL DOES SHOW, NO MATTER HOW THE NUMBERS ARE </p><p>SLICED, THAT SUPPORT FOR THE TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES </p><p>APPEARS TO BE NEARLY EVENLY DIVIDED.  BOTH PARTIES </p><p>APPEAR TO BE HOLDING ONTO THEIR KEY REGIONS AND </p><p>DEMOGRAPHICS FOR SUPPORT.  MORE THAN A YEAR OF ECONOMIC </p><p>DECLINE AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAS ERODED SUPPORT FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE SOMEWHAT, BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT </p><p>MIGHT BE EXPECTED.  THE SURVEY RESULTS COULD EVEN </p><p>REPRESENT A TURNAROUND FOR ZANU-PF, WHICH A YEAR AGO WAS </p><p>AT ITS LOWEST SUPPORT LEVELS SINCE INDEPENDENCE, IF ONE </p><p>USES THE LAST HELEN SUZMAN FOUNDATION POLL AS A GUIDE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03398  02 OF 02  141508Z </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: THE KEY FACTOR IN THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL BE THE LARGE NUMBER OF </p><p>UNDECIDED VOTERS AND WHETHER THEY TURN OUT TO VOTE.  IT </p><p>IS UNKNOWN HOW MANY OF THESE MAY BE MDC SUPPORTERS </p><p>AFRAID TO EXPREC THEIR TRUE OPINION.  A SHOCKING 25 </p><p>PERCENT OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS REVEALED THAT THEY CHANGED </p><p>THEIR VOTING BEHAVIOR IN 2000 BECAUSE OF POLITICAL </p><p>INTIMIDATION (14 PERCENT DID NOT VOTE AND 11 PERCENT </p><p>VOTED FOR A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE).  THE "UNDECIDEDS" MAY </p><p>WELL DECIDE TO STAY HOME ON ELECTION DAY IF THEY FEEL </p><p>UNSAFE, WHILE ONLY THE DIEHARD SUPPORTERS OF BOTH </p><p>PARTIES CAST THEIR BALLOT.  WITH ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF </p><p>INCUMBENCY, IT WOULD THEN BE MUCH EASIER FOR ZANU-PF TO </p><p>MANIPULATE A CLOSE ELECTION.  NEW SURVEYS DUE OUT THIS </p><p>MONTH SHOULD SHED MORE LIGHT ON THE LIKELY ELECTION </p><p>OUTCOME.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
