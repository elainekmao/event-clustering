<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 001430 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MINISTER OF AVIATION REQUESTS U.S. </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO INVESTIGATE EAS AIRLINE CRASH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(u) Ambassador received an urgent call from the Nigerian </p><p>Minister of Aviation Kemi Chikwe with an appeal for </p><p>assistance in investigating the Saturday, May 4 crash of </p><p>the EAS BAC1-11-500 aircraft in Kano. The EAS aircraft </p><p>crashed almost immediately after takeoff, killing all 79 </p><p>passengers and crew on board and approximately 30 people on </p><p>the ground (SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (u) Chikwe requested an aviation expert in airworthiness </p><p>and an investigator for the crash site, which is spread </p><p>over several kilometers in a residential section of the </p><p>city of Kano. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (u) The Minister said that a Special Panel to </p><p>investigate the crash was being set up.  Chief Justice of </p><p>the Supreme Court Muhammad Uwais will head the Special </p><p>Panel.  The Panel will begin meeting next week and hopes to </p><p>complete its work in three or four weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (u) In addition to investigating the cause of the EAS </p><p>crash, Chikwe said that the Panel will also investigate the </p><p>sourcing of aircraft by domestic carriers as well as their </p><p>places of maintenance.  Chikwe also asked for assistance in </p><p>identifying better sources for aircraft and maintenance. </p><p>She said there are safety concerns about present sources </p><p>for both aircraft procurement and maintenance, which are </p><p>mainly British, American and Eastern European.  (Note: </p><p>There are also several airlines that use former Yugoslav </p><p>commercial aircraft. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (u) Comment: We would like to be responsive. If nothing </p><p>more, American experts can perhaps help the GON better </p><p>define its terms of reference and scope of work on what </p><p>appears, at first glance, to be an enormous and very </p><p>complex undertaking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (u) Chikwe\'s request, which was not unexpected, would </p><p>seem to fall squarely within our "safe skies" initiative. </p><p>The EAS aircraft was British manufacture, and we would be </p><p>surprised if Chikwe also has not approached the British for </p><p>assistance (we will endeavor to find out). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (u) We have long maintained that  most domestic </p><p>commercial airlines in Nigeria are unsafe. A thorough </p><p>investigation into aircraft procurement and maintenance </p><p>practices is long overdue. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
