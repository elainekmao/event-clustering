<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BEIJING 10642 </p><p> </p><p>NIACT IMMEDIATE FOR OPS CENTER ONLY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, CH </p><p>SUBJECT:  PRO-DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATORS FLOOD TIANANMEN </p><p>SQUARE IN SECOND NIGHT OF DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS FROM BEIJING </p><p>UNIVERSITIES FLOODED TIANANMEN SQUARE IN CENTRAL </p><p>BEIJING FOR A SECOND NIGHT ON APRIL 18.  THEY CROWDED </p><p>AROUND THE BASE OF THE MARTYRS MONUMENT AT THE CENTER </p><p>OF THE SQUARE CHANTING PRO-DEMOCRACY SLOGANS AND </p><p>SINGING PATRIOTIC SONGS.  TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND </p><p>PEACEFUL BUT SYMPATHETIC ONLOOKERS SURROUNDED THE </p><p>CORE OF STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS.  LATE IN THE EVENING </p><p>BETWEEN TWO AND THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS MARCHED TO </p><p>THE ZHONGNANHAI LEADERSHIP COMPOUND SEVERAL BLOCKS </p><p>FROM THE SQUARE AND SAT AT THE GATE.  ALTHOUGH POLOFF </p><p>AT THE SQUARE WITNESSED NO VIOLENCE, THE XINHUA NEWS </p><p>AGENCY REPORTED ON APRIL 19 THAT A POLICE OFFICER </p><p>SUSTAINED A MINOR INJURY WHEN A SMALL NUMBER OF </p><p>STUDENTS ATTEMPTED TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO </p><p>ZHONGNANHAI IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS AT ZHONGNANHAI REPORTEDLY DISPERSED </p><p>BETWEEN 4:00 AM AND 5:00 AM ON THE MORNING OF </p><p>APRIL 19.  NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  LAST NIGHT\'S DEMONSTRATION WAS AMONG THE LARGEST </p><p>UNOFFICIAL GATHERINGS AT THE SQUARE SINCE HUNDREDS OF </p><p>THOUSANDS OF BEIJINGERS FLOODED TIANANMEN TO </p><p>COMMEMORATE THE DEATH OF ZHOU ENLAI AND PROTEST THE </p><p>GANG OF FOUR IN APRIL, 1976.  TIANANMEN WAS ALSO THE </p><p>SCENE OF PRO-DEMOCRACY STUDENT GATHERINGS IN LATE </p><p>1985 AND LATE 1986.  A STUDENT ATTEMPT TO DEMONSTRATE </p><p>THERE FIZZLED IN MID-1988.  THIS TIME STUDENTS </p><p>APPEARED BETTER ORGANIZED THAN IN THE PAST, AS </p><p>EVIDENCED BY THE PREVALENCE OF STUDENTS WEARING DARK </p><p>MOURNING CLOTHES, COORDINATION OF THE ZHONGNANHAI </p><p>MARCH, AND SLOGANS APPARENTLY AGREED UPON IN ADVANCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE DEATH OF POLITBURO MEMBER AND OUSTED PARTY </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL HU YAOBANG PROVIDED DISCONTENTED </p><p>STUDENTS WITH A CONVENIENT PRETEXT FOR DEMONSTRATING. </p><p>THAT STUDENTS WERE ALLOWED TO GATHER AT THEIR </p><p>UNIVERSITIES TO ORGANIZE THE DEMONSTRATION AS WELL AS </p><p>THE SURPRISINGLY LIGHT POLICE PRESENCE AT TIANANMEN </p><p>SUGGEST THAT THE AUTHORITIES WILL TOLERATE STUDENT </p><p>SENTIMENT FOR THE MOMENT.  AN OFFICIAL MOURNING </p><p>CEREMONY FOR HU YAOBANG IS SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 22. </p><p>AUTHORITIES MAY WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE CEREMONY BEFORE </p><p>MOVING TO STOP THE DEMONSTRATIONS.  LIKE ITS </p><p>PREDECESSORS, THIS OUTPOURING MAY VERY WELL INTENSIFY </p><p>PRESENT LEADERSHIP DEBATES OVER POLICY AND PERSONNEL </p><p>ISSUES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE CROWD AT TIANANMEN </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>5.  THE APRIL 15 DEATH OF FORMER PARTY GENERAL </p><p>SECRETARY HU YAOBANG CONTINUES GENERATE STUDENT </p><p>ACTIVITY ON BEIJING CAMPUSES AND AT TIANANMEN </p><p>SQUARE.  ON APRIL 18, A CORE CADRE OF STUDENTS SPENT </p><p>THE ENTIRE DAY AT THE MARTYRS MONUMENT, A TALL STELA </p><p>AT THE HEART OF TIANANMEN SQUARE.  THEY WERE JOINED </p><p>IN THE EARLY EVENING BY OTHER STUDENTS FROMBEIJING, </p><p>QINGHUA, AND PEOPLE\'S UNIVERSITIES.  POLOFF PRESENT </p><p>AT TIANANMEN ALSO SAW STUDENTS FROM THE BEIJING </p><p>ENGINEERING UNIVERSITY ARRIVE AT THE SQUARE AT ABOUT </p><p>9:00 PM.  AT 9:30 PM STUDENTS THAT HAD PACKED </p><p>SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER AT THE BASE OF THE MONUMENT </p><p>NUMBERED BETWEEN TWO AND THREE THOUSAND </p><p>PEOPLE.  A PEOPLE\'S UNIVERSITY STUDENT TOLD POLOFF </p><p>THAT THE STUDENTS FROM HIS SCHOOL ALONE NUMBERED OVER </p><p>700. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MOST DEMONSTRATORS AT THE MONUMENT WORE DARK </p><p>CLOTHES OF MOURNING.  THEY CHANTED SUCH SLOGANS AS </p><p>"LONG LIVE DEMOCRACY" AND "OPPOSE OFFICIAL </p><p>CORRUPTION."  AT ONE POINT STUDENTS WHO HAD CLIMBED </p><p>THE MONUMENT\'S PEDIMENT RAISED A BANNER STATING </p><p>"OVERTHROW AUTOCRATIC BUREAUCRACY."  AT THE CENTER OF </p><p>THE MONUMENT FLEW A THIRTY FOOT BANNER RAISED BY </p><p>BEIJING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHICH STATED "ALWAYS </p><p>REMEMBER COMRADE HU YAOBANG."  AT THE BANNER\'S CENTER </p><p>STUDENTS HAD PAINTED THREE LARGE CHARACTERS FOR THE </p><p>PHRASE "CHINA\'S SPIRIT" (ZHONGGUO HUN). </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS ALSO ENTHUSIASTICALLY SANG PATRIOTIC </p><p>SONGS SUCH AS THE "INTERNATIONALE." </p><p> </p><p>7.  BETWEEN 10 AND 15 THOUSAND CURIOUS BEIJINGERS OF </p><p>ALL AGES AND ALL OCCUPATIONS THRONGED THE SQUARE </p><p>SURROUNDING THE STELA.  THE ONLOOKERS WERE PEACEFUL </p><p>BUT APPEARED LARGELY SYMPATHETIC TO THE STUDENTS. </p><p>THEY CHEERED EACH TIME A STUDENT CLIMBED THE </p><p>MONUMENT\'S HIGH PEDIMENT TO PLACE A MOURNING WREATH </p><p>OR A BANNER.  ON OCCASION, A LARGE NUMBER OF THE </p><p>ONLOOKERS CLAPPED OR SHOUTED IN APPROVAL OF THE </p><p>PRO-DEMOCRACY SLOGANS CHANTED BY THE DEMONSTRATORS. </p><p>SMALL GROUPS OF YOUTHS AND OTHERS GATHERED IN TIGHT </p><p>HUDDLES AROUND THE SQUARE TO DISCUSS POLITICS. </p><p>POLOFF WITNESSED A CROWD GATHER SPONTANEOUSLY AROUND </p><p>A MIDDLE AGED MAN WHO BEGAN TO DISCUSS WITH HIS </p><p>FRIEND THE PROS AND CONS OF THE STUDENTS\' ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THE MARCH TO ZHONGNANHAI </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>8.  AT 9:45 PM A CROWD OF BETWEEN 500 TO ONE THOUSAND </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS CARRYING A WREATH DESCENDED FROM THE </p><p>BASE OF THE MONUMENT AND PROCEEDED NORTH THROUGH THE </p><p>SQUARE TO CHANGAN AVENUE, BEIJING\'S MAIN </p><p>THOROUGHFARE.  FOLLOWED BY A HUGE NUMBER OF </p><p>ONLOOKERS, THEY TURNED TO MEET A PARADE OF BETWEEN </p><p>ONE AND TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED </p><p>AT THE SQUARE FROM THE UNIVERSITY DISTRICT IN BEIJING\'S </p><p>NORTHWEST SUBURBS, A TWO TO THREE HOUR MARCH AWAY. </p><p>THE MARCHERS, WHO APPEARED TO HAIL MOSTLY FROM BEIJING </p><p>AND QINGHUA UNIVERSITIES, CARRIED ANOTHER WREATH AND </p><p>A LARGE PRO-DEMOCRACY BANNER.  THE COMBINED CROWD </p><p>MARCHED ONCE AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE SQUARE AND </p><p>HEADED FOR THE XINHUA GATE, THE SOUTH ENTRANCE TO THE </p><p>ZHONGNANHAI LEADERSHIP COMPOUND.  (NOTE: A WESTERN </p><p>REPORTER ESTIMATED THE SIZE OF THE MARCH AT 4 </p><p>THOUSAND PEOPLE, BUT THIS IS ON THE HIGH END OF THE </p><p>SCALE.  TWO TO THREE THOUSAND SEEMS MORE LIKE IT. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  REACHING ZHONGNANHAI AT ABOUT 10:45 PM, THE LEAD </p><p>MARCHERS PLACED TWO OR THREE WREATHS HONORING HU </p><p>YAOBANG BEFORE THE DOORS OF THE GATE.  THEY THEN SAT </p><p>DOWN TO CHANT SLOGANS AND SING.  SEVERAL THOUSAND </p><p>ONLOOKERS CROWDED THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AVENUE AS </p><p>LATE NIGHT TRAFFIC IN THE AREA GROUND TO A HALT.  AS </p><p>OF POLOFF\'S DEPARTURE FROM THE SCENE AT 11:45 PM, THE </p><p>CROWD AT THE GATE HAD CONFINED ITSELF TO VERBAL </p><p>DISPLAYS OF ITS SYMPATHIES.  HOWEVER, AN APRIL 19 NEW </p><p>CHINA NEWS AGENCY (XINHUA) RELEASE REPORTED THAT AT </p><p>12:20 AM "A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE" HOLDING WREATHS </p><p>WERE STOPPED BY GUARDS AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO ENTER THE </p><p>GATE.  THERE WERE THREE SUCH ATTEMPTS, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE ARTICLE.  THE STORY ALSO STATED THAT ONE GUARD </p><p>WAS LIGHTLY INJURED WHEN SOME DEMONSTRATORS BEGAN </p><p>THROWING BOTTLES AND SHOES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  AT 4:20 AM ON WEDNESDAY, LOUDSPEAKERS IN THE </p><p>AREA BROADCAST A BEIJING CITY GOVERNMENT NOTICE </p><p>URGING MARCHERS TO RETURN HOME, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>XINHUA STORY.  THE ARTICLE QUOTES THE NOTICE AS </p><p>STATING THAT "IT IS ILLEGAL AND IMPERMISSIBLE TO </p><p>BREAK INTO PARTY AND GOVERNMENT ORGANS."  THE ARTICLE </p><p>REPORTED THAT BETWEEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND ABOUT </p><p>5:00 AM, THE CROWD DISPERSED AND ORDER IN THE AREA </p><p>HAD BEEN RESTORED.  WE BELIEVE THAT A CORE GROUP OF </p><p>STUDENTS REMAINED AT THE MONUMENT THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>NIGHT.  WE HAVE JUST HEARD REPORTS THAT AS OF MID-DAY </p><p>APRIL 19, SEVERAL THOUSAND STUDENTS REMAIN IN </p><p>TIANANMEN. </p><p> </p><p>POLICE PRESENCE DISCREET </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>11.  SURPRISINGLY, UNIFORMED POLICE WERE ALMOST </p><p>ENTIRELY ABSENT FROM TIANANMEN SQUARE ITSELF </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE EVENING\'S FESTIVITIES.  HOWEVER, </p><p>JUDGING FROM THE NUMBER OF OFFICIAL VEHICLES PARKED </p><p>IN FRONT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MUSEUM WHICH FLANKS THE </p><p>EAST SIDE OF THE SQUARE, A LARGE CONTINGENT OF PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY OFFICERS MAY HAVE GARRISONED THE MUSEUM\'S </p><p>SPACIOUS INTERIOR COURTYARD.  UNARMED POLICE ON THE </p><p>STREETS SURROUNDING TIANANMEN SQUARE MAINTAINED A </p><p>FORCE LEVEL SUFFICIENT ONLY TO DIRECT TRAFFIC.  MORE </p><p>PUBLIC SECURITY OFFICERS, AGAIN UNARMED, CIRCLED THE </p><p>CROWD OF DEMONSTRATORS AS THEY SAT BEFORE THE GATE AT </p><p>ZHONGNANHAI, BUT THEIR NUMBERS REMAINED INSUFFICIENT </p><p>TO CONTROL DEMONSTRATORS IN THE EVENT OF VIOLENCE. </p><p>POLOFF WITNESSED NO OVERT FRICTION BETWEEN </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS AND POLICE THROUGHOUT HIS STAY ON THE </p><p>SQUARE.  POLOFF ALSO SAW NO ARRESTS.  AS FAR AS WE </p><p>KNOW, NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY THE PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>STUDENTS SHOW IMPROVED ORGANIZATION </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>12.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE APRIL 18 DEMONSTRATION TO </p><p>HAVE BEEN AMONG THE LARGEST UNOFFICIAL GATHERINGS AT </p><p>TIANANMEN SINCE THE APRIL, 1976 RIOTS, WHEN </p><p>BEIJINGERS FLOODED THE CITY\'S CENTRAL SQUARE TO SHOW </p><p>SUPPORT FOR DECEASED PREMIER ZHOU ENLAI\'S POLICIES. </p><p>STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED AT TIANANMEN IN SEPTEMBER, 1985 </p><p>AND AGAIN IN DECEMBER, 1986.  IN JUNE, 1988 HUNDREDS </p><p>OF POLICE SUCCESSFULLY CORDONED OFF THE SQUARE TO </p><p>PREVENT PRO-DEMOCRACY BEIJING UNIVERSITY </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS FROM GATHERING. </p><p> </p><p>13.  LAST NIGHT THE STUDENTS DISPLAYED A DEGREE OF </p><p>ORGANIZATION HIGHER THAN IN PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS. </p><p>HUNDREDS OF DEMONSTRATORS CROWDING THE MONUMENT FROM </p><p>DIFFERENT SCHOOLS ALL WORE DARK CLOTHING.  STUDENTS </p><p>SEEM TO HAVE AGREED THAT THEIR SLOGANS SHOULD REMAIN </p><p>GENERAL AND NOT DIRECTLY STRIKE AT THE PARTY OR AT </p><p>INDIVIDUAL LEADERS.  IT APPEARS UNLIKELY THAT THE </p><p>MARCHERS WHO ARRIVED AT THE SQUARE LATE IN THE </p><p>EVENING TO LINK UP WITH THEIR CLASSMATES ALREADY </p><p>THERE COULD NOT HAVE PARADED AROUND THE SQUARE AND </p><p>HEADED FOR ZHONGNANHAI SMOOTHLY WITHOUT PRIOR </p><p>PLANNING. </p><p> </p><p>WHY NOW? </p><p>-------- </p><p>14.  THIS AND PAST DEMONSTRATIONS SUGGEST THAT </p><p>STUDENT FRUSTRATION WITH LEADERSHIP POLITICAL </p><p>RIGIDITY AND WITH THEIR OWN LOW PROSPECTS AND </p><p>STANDARD OF LIVING RUNS DEEP.  IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT </p><p>THEY WILL SCRIBBLE MORDANTLY CRITICAL BIG CHARACTER </p><p>POSTERS AND THREATEN TO DEMONSTRATE WHENEVER GIVEN </p><p>THE CHANCE.  LAST YEAR, BEIJING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS </p><p>NEARLY TOOK TO THE STREETS AFTER A GANG OF </p><p>DELINQUENTS MURDERED A GRADUATE STUDENT IN A SCUFFLE </p><p>OFF CAMPUS.  THIS YEAR, DISCONTENT HAD ALREADY MADE </p><p>ITSELF FELT DURING THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED NPC, WHEN </p><p>BEIJING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TACKED UP PRO-DEMOCRACY </p><p>POSTERS AND HELD UNAUTHORIZED POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS </p><p>ON CAMPUS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE DEATH OF HU YAOBANG, WHO WAS WIDELY THOUGHT </p><p>TO HAVE CHAMPIONED DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AS WELL AS </p><p>INTELLECTUAL AND STUDENT CAUSES, HAS PROVIDED </p><p>STUDENTS WITH A CONVENIENT PRETEXT FOR ACTION. </p><p>STUDENT GRIEF OVER HU\'S PASSING HAS BEEN EVIDENT AND </p><p>SINCERE.  BUT A STRONG DESIRE TO SEE SPEEDIER </p><p>DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR OWN </p><p>SITUATIONS LIES AT THE BASE OF THESE CURRENT </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS.  PRO-DEMOCRACY SLOGANS FAR OUTNUMBER </p><p>STUDENTS\' VOCAL EXPRESSIONS OF GRIEF FOR THE FALLEN </p><p>POLITBURO MEMBER.  THE KNOTS OF PEOPLE ABOUT THE </p><p>SQUARE WERE TALKING POLITICS, NOT EXCHANGING HU </p><p>YAOBANG REMINISCENCES. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT\'S THE PARTY TO DO? </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>16.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEADERSHIP HAS AT LEAST </p><p>TACITLY DECIDED TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO BLOW OFF STEAM </p><p>AT THE SQUARE AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT TURN VIOLENT, DO </p><p>NOT DIRECTLY ATTACK THE PARTY, AND GATHER OSTENSIBLY </p><p>TO MOURN HU YAOBANG.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT BEIJING </p><p>UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN UNDER PARTICULARLY TIGHT CONTROL </p><p>BY SECURITY ORGANS SINCE THE 1985 DEMONSTRATIONS. </p><p>OFFICIAL INTIMIDATION OF WOULD BE DEMONSTRATORS </p><p>APPEARS TO HAVE GREATLY HINDERED STUDENT ORGANIZING </p><p>SINCE THEN.  THAT BEIJING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ARE OUT </p><p>IN FORCE THIS TIME INDICATES TO US THAT UNIVERSITY </p><p>OFFICIALS AND SECURITY ORGANS MAY HAVE BEEN TOLD TO </p><p>PLAY IT COOL.  LIGHT POLICE PRESENCE ON THE SQUARE </p><p>ALSO SUGGESTS LEADERSHIP TOLERANCE OF THE </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS FOR THE TIME BEING. </p><p> </p><p>17.  THE LEADERSHIP MAY BE HOPING THAT THE FRENETIC </p><p>STUDENTS, MANY OF WHOM APPEAR TO HAVE CAMPED OUT ON </p><p>TIANANMEN FOR THREE DAYS NOW, MAY SIMPLY TIRE OUT AND </p><p>CALL IT QUITS.  THE AUTHORITIES HAVE DECIDED TO HOLD </p><p>AN OFFICIAL MEMORIAL CEREMONY FOR HU YAOBANG ON </p><p>SATURDAY, APRIL 22.  THIS WOULD BE THE LOGICAL DATE </p><p>BEYOND WHICH LEADERS COULD CEASE TO TOLERATE STUDENT </p><p>ACTIVISM.  THEY WOULD PROBABLY THEN CLAIM THAT THE </p><p>LEGITIMATE MOURNING PERIOD FOR HU HAD FINISHED AND </p><p>THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR FURTHER ACTIVITIES.  THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S UNIVERSITY STUDENT TOLD POLOFF THAT HE </p><p>THOUGHT STUDENTS WOULD GATHER AT THE SQUARE UNTIL THE </p><p>MEMORIAL CEREMONY. </p><p> </p><p>18.  HOWEVER THE PARTY SEEKS PUBLICLY TO CHARACTERIZE </p><p>THE ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE SO FAR CULMINATED IN THE </p><p>APRIL 18 DEMONSTRATION, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE STUDENTS </p><p>ARE VOICING SENTIMENTS ABOUT HU YAOBANG, THE </p><p>AUTOCRATIC BUREAUCRACY, AND INCREASED OFFICIAL </p><p>CORRUPTION THAT MANY REGULAR BEIJING CITIZENS SEEM TO </p><p>SHARE AT LEAST QUIETLY.  LIKE ITS PREDECESSORS, THIS </p><p>OUTPOURING MAY VERY WELL INTENSIFY PRESENT LEADERSHIP </p><p>DEBATES OVER POLICY AND PERSONNEL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LORD </p><p></p></div>
