<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 016445 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SMEC AND NEA/IAI </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PTER, PGOV, KPAL, KWBG, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  HAMAS/PA AGREEMENT: ON THE BRINK AGAIN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) TEL AVIV 15788, (B) TEL AVIV 10167 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT.  OADR BASED ON </p><p>INFORMATION FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENT SOURCES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY </p><p>(PA) AND HAMAS APPEARS IMMINENT.  REPORTEDLY, AFTER </p><p>A LOCAL HAMAS DELEGATION MET WITH OUTSIDE LEADERS, </p><p>CONSENSUS WAS REACHED ON THE ORGANIZATION\'S NEED TO </p><p>MOVE FROM ARMED OPPOSITION TO ISRAEL, TO POLITICAL </p><p>OPPOSITION IN ORDER TO AVOID BECOMING IRRELEVANT. </p><p>HAMAS LOST SUPPORT IN GAZA AFTER THE ISRAELIS AND </p><p>THE PA SUCCEEDED IN CEMENTING THE LINK BETWEEN HAMAS </p><p>MILITARY ACTIONS AND THE CLOSURE ON GAZA AND OTHER </p><p>ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUMBER OF </p><p>HAMAS MEMBERS WHO BELIEVE THAT POLITICAL </p><p>PARTICIPATION IS THE ONLY WAY FOR HAMAS TO REGAIN </p><p>POPULAR SUPPORT AND TAKE ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN </p><p>PALESTINIAN PUBLIC LIFE INCREASED.  THESE MODERATES, </p><p>HOWEVER, FACE HAMAS RADICALS INSIDE GAZA AS WELL AS </p><p>ABROAD, WHO REMAIN COMMITTED TO CONTINUING ARMED </p><p>STRUGGLE AGAINST ISRAEL AND WHO HAVE TRIED TO CAST </p><p>SUSPICION ON THOSE WHO WANT TO TRY OTHER METHODS. </p><p>EVEN WHEN THE ORGANIZATION TAKES A FORMAL DECISION </p><p>TO ABJURE MILITARY OPERATIONS, THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>ROGUE OPERATIONS REMAINS HIGH. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GAZANS WELCOME RESPITE FROM ATTACKS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA) OFFICIALS AND PRIVATE </p><p>GAZANS AGREE THAT PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR HAMAS MILITARY </p><p>ACTIONS HAS DECREASED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT MONTHS </p><p>(REF A).  UNTIL THE GOI IMPOSED THE LATEST CLOSURE </p><p>(WHICH HAS ALREADY LASTED MORE THAN A MONTH) GAZANS </p><p>HAD BECOME USED TO A MEASURE OF NORMALCY IN THEIR </p><p>DAILY LIVES AND A CHANCE TO ENJOY SOME OF THE </p><p>VISIBLE IMPROVEMENTS IN GAZA.  THESE INCLUDED THE </p><p>ABILITY OF THOSE WITH PERMITS TO GO TO THEIR JOBS IN </p><p>ISRAEL.  GAZANS HAVE ALSO WELCOMED THE SIGNS OF </p><p>INCREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN GAZA.  INCREASED </p><p>CONSTRUCTION IS THE MOST FREQUENT EXAMPLE.  WHILE </p><p>UNSURE WHO WILL LIVE IN ALL THE BUILDINGS GOING UP, </p><p>GAZANS SEE THEM AS PROOF THAT PEOPLE WITH MONEY HAVE </p><p>FAITH IN THE AREA\'S FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PA CAPITALIZED ON GOI PENALTIES </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  PALESTINIANS ARE UNANIMOUS IN THEIR BELIEF THAT </p><p>CLOSURES IN RESPONSE TO TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE A FORM </p><p>OF COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT.  AT THE SAME TIME, THEY </p><p>GRUDGINGLY AGREE THAT THEY WORKED.  ATTACKS STOPPED </p><p>DURING CLOSURES, AND THE PUBLIC SUFFERING FROM THE </p><p>ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES, LED MANY TO RESENT THE </p><p>ATTACKS THAT BROUGHT THE CLOSURES.  PA OFFICIALS AND </p><p>GAZANS WITH CLOSE CONTACTS TO HAMAS OFFICIALS </p><p>BELIEVE THAT ARAFAT WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE GAZANS THAT </p><p>HAMAS IS NOT ONLY CAUSING ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS ON </p><p>PALESTINIANS THROUGH ITS MILITARY ACTIONS, BUT HAS </p><p>ALSO FAILED--UNLIKE THE PA--IN THE PRIMARY </p><p>PALESTINIAN GOAL OF REGAINING TERRITORY FROM ISRAEL. </p><p>ALTHOUGH MOST GAZANS EXPECTED A LENGTHY CLOSURE </p><p>AROUND THE JEWISH HOLIDAYS, THE GOI PUBLIC </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT, THAT THE CURRENT CLOSURE (SCHEDULED TO </p><p>BE LIFTED OCTOBER 17) IS IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC </p><p>THREATS FROM RADICAL GROUPS, INCLUDING HAMAS, KEEPS </p><p>THE LINKAGE FRONT AND CENTER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHAT HAMAS WANTED FROM THE PA </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  HAMAS MEMBERS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEIR </p><p>STANDING AMONG GAZANS HAS FALLEN.  THAT, ALONG WITH </p><p>THE PA\'S DEMONSTRATED READINESS TO ENGAGE THEIR </p><p>MILITARY WING, ARREST AND ILL-TREAT THEIR MEMBERS </p><p>(INCLUDING THEIR POLITICAL SPOKESMEN), PRESSURE </p><p>THEIR SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND SHUT DOWN THEIR </p><p>PUBLICATIONS, LED THEM TO NEGOTIATIONS.  HAMAS HOPED </p><p>TO GAIN FACE-SAVING MEASURES IN EXCHANGE FOR HALTING </p><p>ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS.  ACCORDING TO PA OFFI </p><p>CIALS, THESE INCLUDED THE RELEASE OF ALL OF THEIR MEMBERS </p><p>IN DETENTION (REPORTEDLY, EVEN THOSE SENTENCED BY </p><p>THE SECURITY COURT); A GUARANTEE OF MID-LEVEL </p><p>POSITIONS IN THE PA; A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SEATS AFTER </p><p>PALESTINIAN GENERAL ELECTIONS; AND PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE </p><p>OF RESPONSIBILITY  FOR THE BLOODY CLASH IN 1994 </p><p>WHICH LEFT 16 PALESTINIANS DEAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OSLO II DRASTICALLY ALTERED THE BALANCE OF POWER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS THE OSLO II NEGOTIATIONS GOT UNDERWAY, </p><p>PRESSURE ON HAMAS TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE </p><p>PA MOUNTED.  WHILE PA OFFICIALS (INCLUDING PA </p><p>SECRETARY GENERAL TAYYIB ABDURRAHIM, JUSTICE </p><p>MINISTER FREIH ABU MIDDEIN AND PALESTINIAN POLICE </p><p>COMMANDER NASIR YUSIF) ALL MAINTAINED THAT HAMAS WAS </p><p>READY TO COME TO CLOSURE WITH THE PA, PROVIDED IT </p><p>DID NOT HAVE TO PUBLICLY SWEAR OFF ALL MILITARY </p><p>ACTIONS AGAINST ISRAELIS AND WAS PROMISED A REAL </p><p>VOICE IN THE AUTHORITY, ARAFAT WITHHELD AGREEMENT ON </p><p>A DRAFT ACCORD THAT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED.  YUSIF TOLD </p><p>US OCTOBER 12 THAT ARAFAT HAD REFUSED TO SIGN IN THE </p><p>BELIEF THAT HE COULD GET WHAT HE NEEDED FROM HAMAS </p><p>WITHOUT MEETING MOST OF THEIR DEMANDS.  YUSIF </p><p>BELIEVED THAT SUBSEQUENT EVENTS HAVE PROVED ARAFAT </p><p>RIGHT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PA AND HAMAS REPORTEDLY NOW ON THE BRINK OF </p><p>ANNOUNCING AGREEMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE CONCLUSION OF THE OSLO II AGREEMENT </p><p>APPARENTLY BOLSTERED THE MODERATES IN HAMAS AND A </p><p>TEAM OF HAMAS SUPPORTERS WAS DISPATCHED TO KHARTOUM </p><p>TO GAIN CONCURRENCE FROM HAMAS LEADERS ABROAD.  ABU </p><p>MIDDEIN TOLD US LATE OCTOBER 12 THAT THE TEAM HAD </p><p>BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  SIMILARLY, GAZA REUTERS CHIEF, </p><p>TAHER SHRITEH, TOLD US OCTOBER 13 THAT A SENIOR PA </p><p>OFFICIAL HAD TOLD HIM THAT THE HAMAS DELEGATION HAD </p><p>RETURNED FROM SUDAN WITH A NEW DRAFT AGREEMENT, AND </p><p>THAT AFTER A MIDNIGHT MEETING WITH PA OFFICIALS, </p><p>BOTH SIDES WERE WILLING TO SIGN IT.  SHRITEH SAID </p><p>BOTH SIDES WERE UNWILLING TO TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS </p><p>NOW, BUT HE EXPECTED AN ANNOUNCEMENT, IF NOT TODAY, </p><p>WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN THIS REGARD, IN PUBLIC REMARKS OCTOBER 13, </p><p>HAMAS LEADER MAHMOUD ZAHAR ALLUDED TO HAMAS\' (AND </p><p>OTHER PARTIES) OBJECTIONS TO THE DRAFT PARTIES LAW </p><p>(SEPTEL), HE SAID "WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN ANY ELECTION, BUT NOW WE CANNOT SPEAK </p><p>ABOUT ELECTIONS EXCEPT AFTER KNOWING WHAT ARE THE </p><p>DETAILS OF SUCH ELECTION."  RESPONDING TO A QUESTION </p><p>ABOUT WHETHER HAMAS WOULD PARTICIPATE IN A </p><p>GOVERNMENT WITH THE PA, ZAHAR REPLIED, "THIS </p><p>ACTUALLY WILL DEPEND ON THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION. </p><p>SO NO OBJECTION ACTUALLY TO RULE EVERYTHING IN THE </p><p>PROCESS OF RECONSTRUCTION."  ASKED WHETHER HAMAS </p><p>TERRORISM WOULD END AT SOME STAGE, ZAHAR SAID "WE </p><p>HOPE SO...." </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p></p><p>9.  ZAHAR\'S REMARKS ARE NOTEWORTHY COMING IN THE </p><p>DIRECT WAKE OF THE HAMAS DELEGATION\'S RETURN FROM </p><p>SUDAN.  HAMAS\' AGREEMENT TO REFRAIN FROM MILITARY </p><p>OPERATIONS WILL BE KEY TO IMPLEMENTING OSLO II.  IT </p><p>IS WORTH REMEMBERING HOWEVER, THAT IN ADDITION TO </p><p>ROGUE IZZADIN AL QASSAM CELLS, ELEMENTS IN </p><p>PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD REMAIN COMMITTED TO ARMED </p><p>STRUGGLE AGAINST ISRAEL.  OPERATIONS LIKE THE </p><p>JANUARY ATTACK AT BET LID MAKE CLEAR THAT EVEN WITH </p><p>HAMAS FORMALLY ON BOARD, OTHERS COULD PUT A SPANNER </p><p>IN THE WORKS OF OSLO II IMPLEMENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>INDYK </p><p></p></div>
