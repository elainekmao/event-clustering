(SBU) Embassy recommends continued placement of Vietnam </p><p>on USTR\'s Special 301 Watch List for 2003 as enforcement of </p><p>IPR in Vietnam remains weak and IPR violations are rampant. </p><p>We do not believe elevation to the Priority Watch List is </p><p>warranted, however, as: </p><p> </p><p>-- The U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) with its </p><p>major provisions on IPR, commits Vietnam to make its IPR </p><p>regime TRIPs-consistent by December 2003; </p><p> </p><p>-- Vietnam continued over the past year to make progress in </p><p>strengthening its IPR legal and enforcement regimes, with </p><p>new regulations supporting copyright issues for </p><p>architectural works as well as preparations for Vietnam\'s </p><p>accession to UPOV and other IPR-related conventions. </p><p> </p><p>-- the Government of Vietnam maintains a strong public </p><p>commitment to IPR protection; and, </p><p> </p><p>-- the size of the market for U.S. intellectual property </p><p>products in Vietnam remains small, given Vietnam\'s low GDP </p><p>per capita, one of the lowest in the world. </p><p> </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>Continued Placement on Special 301 Watch List Warranted </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Embassy recommends that USTR continue placement of </p><p>Vietnam on its Special 301 "Watch List" for the coming year </p><p>because IPR piracy in many product categories remains </p><p>rampant in Vietnam, despite continued progress in the </p><p>strengthening of Vietnam\'s IPR legal regime.  While Vietnam </p><p>did conduct some law enforcement actions against IPR </p><p>violations over the past year, IPR enforcement remains the </p><p>exception rather than the rule.  At the same time, market </p><p>access barriers, especially with regard to "cultural </p><p>products" continue to impede the availability of legitimate </p><p>product, further complicating efforts to combat piracy. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>BTA - Basis for Bilateral and Multilateral IP Cooperation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Chapter two of the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade </p><p>Agreement (BTA), which entered into force on December 10, </p><p>2001, codifies Vietnam\'s commitment to bring its IPR legal </p><p>regime and enforcement practices up to international </p><p>standards by December 2003, to protect IP consistent with </p><p>WTO TRIPs standards, and in some cases, such as protection </p><p>of satellite signals, to extend protection beyond TRIPs. </p><p>The BTA covers the fields of:  copyright and related rights, </p><p>encrypted satellite signals, trademarks (including well- </p><p>known marks), patents, layout designs of integrated </p><p>circuits, trade secrets, industrial designs, and plant </p><p>varieties.  The BTA incorporates by reference the major </p><p>substantive provisions of the principal international </p><p>conventions governing IP, as well as the WTO TRIPs </p><p>Agreement.  The BTA also commits Vietnam to join the key IP- </p><p>related conventions (it is not already a party to) by 2003. </p><p>Vietnam\'s leadership has expressed consistent and strong </p><p>support for implementing fully Vietnam\'s commitments in the </p><p>agreement, including the IPR chapter. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The BTA is viewed by many, including Vietnam\'s </p><p>leadership, as a roadmap for Vietnam\'s trade and investment </p><p>regime reform and WTO accession.  As such, Vietnam\'s BTA </p><p>commitments, including those on IPR, are widely seen as </p><p>steps Vietnam must take to integrate into the world economy </p><p>and get access to world markets and capital necessary for </p><p>Vietnam\'s economic growth.  In short, the BTA has provided </p><p>Vietnam for the first time with clear links between IPR </p><p>protection and Vietnam\'s ability to access and compete in </p><p>world markets. </p><p>5. (SBU) In addition, the BTA increases international </p><p>pressure on Vietnam in the IPR area.  First, by requiring </p><p>Vietnam to accede to a number of international IPR </p><p>conventions, the BTA\'s IPR commitments actually translate </p><p>into multilateral commitments to protect IPR.  In addition, </p><p>many of Vietnam\'s partners in WTO accession talks have </p><p>already indicated that they expect Vietnam to accord their </p><p>companies and nationals the same treatment in areas such as </p><p>IPR as that pledged to the U.S. in the BTA.  Thus, the BTA </p><p>has created strong expectations and commitments for Vietnam </p><p>in the IPR area vis--vis all of Vietnam\'s trade and </p><p>investment partners, again, significantly upping the ante </p><p>for Vietnam as it reforms its IPR regime. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Improvements in IPR Laws Continue </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Vietnam began extensive legal reforms to bring its </p><p>IPR laws and regulations into compliance with BTA (and </p><p>therefore TRIPs) standards even before entry-into-force of </p><p>the BTA. In 2002, Vietnam continued to make progress on </p><p>strengthening its legislative IPR regime.  The following </p><p>were developments on legal and regulatory reform in the IPR </p><p>sector over the past year: </p><p> </p><p>-- A May 17, 2002 official letter (Ministry of Trade </p><p>Official Letter No. 1901/TM-QLCL) regarding protection of </p><p>Vietnamese trademarks in foreign markets.  This official </p><p>letter seeks to coordinate efforts of ministries and </p><p>People\'s Committees to publicize law and regulations related </p><p>to IP and to research and disseminate legal regulations on </p><p>the registration of trademarks in other major markets </p><p>including the U.S., EU, Japan and ASEAN as well as </p><p>registration of international trademark protection under the </p><p>Madrid Agreement. </p><p> </p><p>-- A June 7, 2002 official letter (Ministry of Trade </p><p>Official Letter No. 2209/TM-QLTT) regarding establishing </p><p>guidelines for combating IPR violations.  This official </p><p>letter tasks the Market Management Bureaus (MMB) with </p><p>increasing the number of inspections related to imported </p><p>counterfeit goods; requires MMB to consult with the Ministry </p><p>of Trade before issuing a decision on a case involving </p><p>foreign goods; and tasks MMB, in coordination with other </p><p>agencies, to draft an inter-ministerial circular on </p><p>inspection and settlement of IPR cases. </p><p> </p><p>-- A June 11, 2002 decree (Government Decree 61/2002/ND-CP) </p><p>on copyright royalties.  This decree establishes guidelines </p><p>governing royalties for authors and owners of works.  The </p><p>decree provides specific grades and/or percentages for each </p><p>genre and scale of work. </p><p> </p><p>-- A July 22, 2002 official letter (Government Official </p><p>Letter No. 4029/VPCP-QHQT) requests the Ministry of Culture </p><p>and Information, in conjunction with other ministries, </p><p>provide the Prime Minister a report on Vietnam\'s accession </p><p>to the Berne Convention, the Brussels Convention, and the </p><p>Rome Convention.  This official letter also tasks the </p><p>Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in </p><p>coordination with other ministries, to submit to the Prime </p><p>Minister a proposal regarding Vietnam\'s accession to UPOV. </p><p> </p><p>-- A December 18, 2002 circular (Ministry of Finance </p><p>Circular No. 92/2002/TT-BTC) provides guidelines for the </p><p>collection of fees related to registration of new plant </p><p>varieties.  New varieties protection charges and a fee scale </p><p>are listed in the collection levels table issued with this </p><p>circular.  This circular is part of GVN preparations for </p><p>joining UPOV. </p><p> </p><p>-- A December 6, 2002 decision (Ministry of Agriculture and </p><p>Rural Development Decision No. 143/2002/QD-BNN) details the </p><p>procedures for conducting tests for distinctness, uniformity </p><p>and stability of varieties of rice hybrids, potatoes, </p><p>soybeans, rice, peanuts, corn and tomatoes. </p><p>-- A January 24, 2003 circular (Ministry of Culture and </p><p>Information and Ministry of Construction joint circular no. </p><p>04/2003/TTLT/BVHTT-BXD) on copyright issues related to </p><p>architectural works.  This circular provides definitions of </p><p>owners of architectural works and details the scope of </p><p>owners\' rights.  Registration procedures for copyright </p><p>protection are also introduced.  This is the first time this </p><p>issue has been addressed by the GVN. </p><p> </p><p>-- A regulation issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and </p><p>Rural Development on the uniformity and stability tests of </p><p>new plant varieties. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) In addition, a number of other laws and regulations </p><p>are in the draft stage including: </p><p> </p><p>-- A draft decree on the Protection of Layout Designs of </p><p>Integrated Circuits was submitted by the National Office of </p><p>Industrial Property (Ministry of Science and Technology) to </p><p>the Prime Minister\'s office in 2002.  The Office of the </p><p>Government is currently revising the draft.  The GVN expects </p><p>to promulgate the decree in early 2003. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Ministry of Justice, with the assistance of both USG- </p><p>funded technical assistance providers and the Japanese </p><p>International Cooperation Agency (JICA), is in the process </p><p>of revising the Civil Code provisions related to IPR.  The </p><p>draft revision is likely to be submitted to the National </p><p>Assembly this year. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Supreme People\'s Court continues to revise a draft </p><p>Civil Procedure Code which will include procedures necessary </p><p>for IPR enforcement. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Piracy Still Rampant </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) While significant progress on the legal and </p><p>regulatory regime continued at a rapid pace over the past </p><p>year, enforcement has had little obvious impact at the </p><p>street level, at least with regard to music, motion picture, </p><p>software and trademark violations.  Hanoi, HCMC and most </p><p>other major cities in Vietnam are rife with music CD, VCD </p><p>and DVD shops, with 100 percent of the U.S. product on sale </p><p>pirated.  Also rampant are video rental shops in which all </p><p>the videos rented are pirated.  Trademark violations are </p><p>also prevalent, with all types of clothing and other items </p><p>carrying unlicensed versions of famous trademarks available </p><p>at small shops and stands throughout the major cities.  None </p><p>of these areas of piracy appeared to be reduced over the </p><p>past year.  In one exceptional trademark case (reported in </p><p>June 02 - see ref (B)), the Ministry of Science and </p><p>Technology (MOST) fined a Hanoi candy shop approximately USD </p><p>460 for infringing the Mars candy trademark and ordered and </p><p>oversaw the removal of the infringing labels from 328 </p><p>packages. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Although nearly all unlicensed showing of U.S. </p><p>films on Vietnam\'s state-owned television stations ended </p><p>following implementation of the U.S.-Vietnam Copyright </p><p>Agreement in December 1997, local private and state-owned </p><p>television stations still violate this from time to time. </p><p>These exceptions, however, are generally infrequent.  Public </p><p>cinemas as well as private cafes sporadically show pirated </p><p>films, although this problem is not as widespread as the </p><p>retail sales of pirated DVD, VCD or videocassette versions </p><p>of the same films.  In one case, however, after a U.S. film </p><p>distributor\'s application to distribute the film "The Last </p><p>Castle" in Vietnam was rejected by the Ministry of Culture </p><p>and Information\'s censorship board, the film ended up not </p><p>only widely available in local DVD shops but was also shown </p><p>at a state-owned movie theater in HCMC. (Reftel (C)) </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) In terms of consumer and business software for PC\'s, </p><p>piracy appears to be the norm.  Anecdotal evidence and </p><p>industry sources suggest that Vietnam Government agencies </p><p>use mostly pirated software on PC\'s in government offices. </p><p>U.S. companies engaged in sales here of such software </p><p>complain that, even if they drop licensing charges to next </p><p>to nothing, Vietnamese businesses and government agencies </p><p>refuse to buy legitimate product because they have no budget </p><p>for software and because of the ready availability of </p><p>pirated versions.  Alternatively, some businesses and </p><p>government agencies purchase a limited number of legitimate </p><p>copies, which they then install on numerous machines (far </p><p>exceeding the limitations set by the licensing agreement). </p><p>Computer hardware retailers reportedly complain to U.S. </p><p>software companies that the PC market in Vietnam is so </p><p>competitive and their margins so slim, that to pay even </p><p>token licensing fees for software would not only wipe out </p><p>their profits but basically all their sales. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Enforcement Remains Weak </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Despite the commitment at the highest levels of </p><p>the Vietnamese Government to creating a body of law on IPR </p><p>consistent with international norms and meeting Vietnam\'s </p><p>international commitments, IPR enforcement remains weak. </p><p>Vietnam is just beginning to establish institutional </p><p>experience in enforcing IPR.  Thus far, IPR laws are only </p><p>really known and/or understood well by a few Ministries in </p><p>Hanoi particularly the Ministry of Science and Technology </p><p>(MOST), through its National Office of Industrial Property </p><p>(NOIP) which oversees patents and trademarks and the </p><p>Ministry of Culture and Information (MOCI), which oversees </p><p>copyrights.  However, these agencies are responsible only </p><p>for "administrative" enforcement of IPR laws, and are mostly </p><p>limited to issuing administrative findings and occasionally </p><p>issuing warnings either by letter or orally to small </p><p>retailers of pirated material. They have no law enforcement </p><p>arm and cannot conduct raids or seize goods.  At the local </p><p>level, Vietnam\'s enforcement personnel seem almost </p><p>completely uninformed on Vietnam\'s own laws and how to </p><p>implement them.  From the police to the courts, Vietnam\'s </p><p>judicial system is relatively unaware of the rights of IPR </p><p>holders or how to prosecute, adjudicate and enforce those </p><p>rights.  Currently there are no procedures in place to </p><p>provide recourse or compensation to rights holders whose </p><p>rights have been violated. The Market Management Bureau, an </p><p>enforcement agency within the Ministry of Trade, engages in </p><p>some IPR enforcement, usually in response to specific </p><p>complaints from IPR holders. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) In October 2002 the HCMC Market Management Board </p><p>(MMB) conducted a well-publicized illegal software raid in </p><p>Vietnam.  The MMB, in conjunction with Microsoft, raided 6 </p><p>or 7 (of the probably hundreds) of local computer shops </p><p>selling pirated software, seizing approximately 7000 disks. </p><p>The results of this raid demonstrate clearly some of the </p><p>weaknesses in Vietnam\'s enforcement regime.  The MMB teams </p><p>seized only disks clearly labeled Microsoft, leaving behind </p><p>blank CDs and blatantly pirated software of non-Microsoft </p><p>origin, such as Adobe.  There was a lack of consistency </p><p>among the various MMB teams - particularly with respect to </p><p>the officials\' understanding of what they were authorized to </p><p>seize.  Only nominal fees were levied (12 million Dong per </p><p>violator, or approximately USD 780), there has apparently </p><p>been no follow up by local authorities, and the shops </p><p>quickly re-opened.  (Reftel D) </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Vietnam\'s agencies do from time to time engage in </p><p>publicized enforcement campaigns that target unlicensed </p><p>goods, including those involving copyright and trademark </p><p>violations, but also those with "illicit or pornographic </p><p>content."  MOCI reported that in the first nine months of </p><p>2002 its inspectors carried out 12,791 surprise inspections, </p><p>identified 2,914 businesses in violation of the law and </p><p>suspended the business licenses of 96 companies as a result. </p><p>They confiscated 215,799 CDs, VCDs, and DVDs and 33,512 </p><p>videotapes. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>Lack of Availability of Legitimate Product </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Given the relative poverty of Vietnam, with a per- </p><p>capita GDP of around 400 dollars, the size of the market for </p><p>U.S. IP product is still relatively small.  While losses to </p><p>piracy are as high as 100 percent of the market, the dollar </p><p>value remains a tiny fraction of losses faced by U.S. IPR- </p><p>related companies in the rest of the region.  In addition, </p><p>some types of products, such as those deemed "cultural </p><p>products", are still subject to censorship and control </p><p>regulations that impede market access.  That said, Vietnam\'s </p><p>economy has much potential and, with a well-educated </p><p>population of 80 million, it will eventually become one of </p><p>the major economies in the region. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Growing Domestic Demand </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) One striking development over the last year has </p><p>been evidence of a growing awareness in many sectors of </p><p>Vietnam\'s economy of the value of IPR protection for </p><p>Vietnamese products both in Vietnam and abroad.  While this </p><p>understanding is still only evident among a small percentage </p><p>of the population, it is growing - among Vietnamese </p><p>agricultural exporters, apparel companies, software </p><p>developers, and artists for example.  This year there have </p><p>been multiple news articles and seminars touting the value </p><p>of brand names.  Also, for the first time, a Vietnamese </p><p>author threatened a lawsuit against a publishing house that </p><p>had published the author\'s work without authorization. These </p><p>groups are a long way from representing a critical mass in </p><p>Vietnam, but as their numbers increase, they will add to the </p><p>international pressure on the GVN to develop effective </p><p>enforcement capabilities in line with its international </p><p>commitments on IPR. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Technical Assistance helpful in Building Enforcement </p><p>Capacity </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  In 2002 Vietnam received considerable IPR-related </p><p>technical assistance from a number of foreign donors, NGO\'s </p><p>as well as multiple USG agencies including the Departments </p><p>of State and Agriculture, USAID, Customs, the U.S. Patent </p><p>and Trademark Office and the U.S. Copyright Office.  (For a </p><p>more complete discussion of IPR-related technical assistance </p><p>in Vietnam see reftel (E).)  This assistance included </p><p>conferences, seminars, training, study tours and </p><p>review/comments on draft pieces of legislation.  In 2003, </p><p>Vietnam will continue to receive a significant level of IPR </p><p>related technical assistance.  Of particular note, the </p><p>Support for Trade AcceleRation (STAR) Project, (the USAID- </p><p>funded technical assistance program specifically addressing </p><p>BTA implementation issues) plans to provide the following </p><p>technical assistance to the GVN: </p><p> </p><p>-- Support MOCI\'s development of regulations on optical disk </p><p>production and distribution; </p><p> </p><p>-- Provide detailed comments on the Ministry of Justice\'s </p><p>redrafting of the Civil Code chapter on IPR (Note:  The </p><p>Civil Code establishes the legal basis for IP protection in </p><p>Vietnam); </p><p> </p><p>-- Support GVN efforts to meet the requirements necessary to </p><p>accede to key IP conventions; </p><p> </p><p>-- Support GVN efforts to develop a civil procedure code - </p><p>particularly with respect to issues related to IPR </p><p>enforcement (such as provisional measures, injunctive </p><p>relief, ex-parte hearings, attorneys\' fees); and </p><p> </p><p>-- Support public education programs to raise awareness with </p><p>regard to the importance to Vietnam for improving the </p><p>protection of IP rights. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Conclusion and Recommendation </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) Vietnam will remain a market in which IPR </p><p>violations are of concern for at least the foreseeable </p><p>future.  That said, Vietnam\'s commitments in the BTA to put </p><p>into place over a short period of time an IPR regime that </p><p>meets world standards is impressive and rare for a country </p><p>at Vietnam\'s stage of development.  U.S. policy should </p><p>continue to work toward ensuring Vietnam\'s commitments are </p><p>translated into good law and regulation in the near term and </p><p>effective enforcement in the medium term.  This can be most </p><p>effectively achieved in Vietnam with a combination of </p><p>support for IPR reform and pressure at senior government </p><p>levels to translate good IPR law and regulation into real </p><p>IPR protection.  Further USG funding for technical </p><p>assistance in IPR, particularly with respect to building </p><p>capacity for IPR enforcement in Vietnam\'s law enforcement </p><p>and judicial organs, would greatly advance this objective. </p><p>At the same time, Mission intends to press senior GVN </p><p>officials at every opportunity to address IPR piracy in </p><p>Vietnam, highlighting the fact that legal reform is not </p><p>sufficient for Vietnam to meet its obligations -- it must </p><p>enforce those laws. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) RECOMMENDATION:  Embassy believes it important to </p><p>maintain pressure on Vietnam to enforce IPR, even as we </p><p>continue to recognize the progress Vietnam has made on legal </p><p>reform in this area.  For that reason, we recommend Vietnam </p><p>be maintained on USTR\'s Special 301 Watch List in 2003. </p><p>Burghardt </p><p></p></div>
