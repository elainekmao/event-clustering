<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002251 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PROPOSED MIDDLE EAST CONFERENCE GREETED WITH </p><p>SKEPTICISM </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA GREGORY L. BERRY FOR REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) A survey of political contacts suggests a general lack </p><p>of enthusiasm over the recent Quartet proposal to stage a </p><p>Middle East conference in the next few weeks.  The GOJ has </p><p>endorsed the proposal with some caveats.  While several </p><p>contacts condemned outright the idea of a conference, a few </p><p>made tentative suggestions about its content.  Most contacts </p><p>questioned the need for such a conference when there are a </p><p>number of previously agreed upon measures that have not been </p><p>implemented.  Most contacts were also deeply skeptical about </p><p>Israeli intentions if such a conference takes place.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>GOJ ENDORSES CONFERENCE PROPOSAL </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The GOJ has publicly reacted positively to the idea of </p><p>a conference, focusing on its content and its participants. </p><p>King Abdullah issued a public statement from Washington </p><p>saying that the conference should be based on relevant </p><p>international resolutions, President Bush\'s speech to the UN, </p><p>and the Saudi initiative.  King Abdullah also stressed that </p><p>all parties should participate in the conference.  Privately, </p><p>however, GOJ contacts have a number of questions about the </p><p>concept.    Foreign Minister Muasher\'s personal assistant Ali </p><p>al-Ayed, told PolCouns that it is the substance of a </p><p>conference and its necessary outcome--creation of a </p><p>Palestinian state--that would likely govern the level of the </p><p>GOJ\'s support.  Jordan, he said, would hope any conference </p><p>would not be "just another forum for expressing views," but </p><p>rather geared to concrete political accomplishments. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>JORDANIANS SUSPICIOUS OF CONFERENCE\'S PURPOSE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Outside the government, some Jordanians welcomed the </p><p>call for a conference with qualifications.  However, all were </p><p>concerned that the real purpose of the conference was to </p><p>change the rules of the peace process and annul Oslo, </p><p>Mitchell, and Tenet.  East Banker and former Minister Nasir </p><p>Lawzi endorsed the conference if the purpose was to find a </p><p>way to implement Mitchell and Tenet.  He urged the U.S. to </p><p>include Syria and Lebanon in the conference, so the entire </p><p>region would be onboard.  He also cautioned that no such </p><p>conference could be held without Arafat, a condition echoed </p><p>by many contacts.  Former Royal Court advisor Adnan Abu Odeh </p><p>favored the concept of a conference if it had the moral </p><p>authority to implement any results, but also thought the </p><p>conference would find little popular support in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Among less moderate Jordanians, the conference was </p><p>roundly criticized.  One PolFSN contact reinforced the </p><p>widely-felt distrust of Israeli intentions towards peace </p><p>negotiations, "Israel has its own agenda--if it really wanted </p><p>peace, why did it not agree to the Saudi plan?"  The same </p><p>source accused Israel of asking for this conference as a way </p><p>to delay and drag out the issues.  Faleh Taweel, former </p><p>Jordanian Ambassador to Iraq and an advocate of most </p><p>anti-Israeli conspiracy theories, said that "if the </p><p>conference is going to be based on the Saudi initiative, it </p><p>will be accepted."  Press coverage in Jordan was both </p><p>suspicious and skeptical of the conference, and more moderate </p><p>Palestinians appeared frustrated with the idea.  "Why not </p><p>implement what we\'ve already decided on?"  One press contact </p><p>viewed the conference as likely to be  insignificant if it is </p><p>held below the summit level.  Almost all contacts agree that </p><p>Arafat, Syria, and Lebanon must be involved if the conference </p><p>is to have any legitimacy. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While the GOJ endorses the idea of a conference, many </p><p>Jordanians view the proposal as ineffective--or worse, as a </p><p>U.S.-backed Israeli plan to dismantle previous agreements and </p><p>to deflect popular anger.  Our argument that a political </p><p>process is one necessary part of any progress is greeted with </p><p>deep skepticism.  The Jordanians\' comments reflect a growing </p><p>level of frustration with the drawn-out nature of the </p><p>political process, seen here as having gained little for </p><p>Palestinians over the past 9 years. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
