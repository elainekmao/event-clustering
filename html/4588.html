WFP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JAMES </p><p>MORRIS VISITED NORTH KOREA, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN </p><p>DURING NOVEMBER 2002, AND IS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED WITH THE </p><p>SIZEABLE RATCHETING DOWN OF BENEFICIARY COVERAGE (BY THREE </p><p>MILLION) DUE TO LACK OF DONOR SUPPORT. CLEARLY, LACK OF ANY </p><p>JAPANESE FOOD ASSISTANCE SUPPORT DURING 2002 (THEY </p><p>CONTRIBUTED 320,000 METRIC TONS IN 2001) - HAS HURT THE </p><p>PROGRAM. MORRIS\' STATEMENT TO THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL ON </p><p>DECEMBER 3 (WHERE HE WILL HIGHLIGHT INTER ALIA CURRENT FOOD </p><p>SHORTFALLS IN NORTH KOREA) AND SUBSEQUENT VISIT TO </p><p>WASHINGTON ON DECEMBER 5 WILL OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIRECT </p><p>DIALOGUE ON 2003 SUPPORT LEVELS AND THE CRITICAL NEED FOR </p><p>INCREASED WFP MONITORING AND ACCESS TO FOOD AID </p><p>DISTRIBUTIONS THROUGHOUT NORTH KOREA. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. IN 2003, WFP ESTIMATES THAT 6.4 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE DPR </p><p>KOREA - MAINLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN - WILL STILL NEED FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN SPITE OF A SLIGHT INCREASE IN PROJECTED </p><p>HARVESTS.  A JOINT FAO/WFP CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY ASSESSMENT </p><p>MISSION, WHICH VISITED THE DPRK IN SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2002 </p><p>HAS FORECAST A 4.9 PERCENT INCREASE IN 2002/03 (NOVEMBER- </p><p>OCTOBER) PRODUCTION OVER LAST YEAR\'S PRODUCTION.  WHILE THIS </p><p>HELPS THE NATIONAL FOOD BALANCE SHEET, DOMESTIC PRODUCTION </p><p>WILL AGAIN FALL BELOW MINIMUM FOOD NEEDS AND THE COUNTRY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05830  01 OF 03  031555Z </p><p>WILL AGAIN HAVE TO DEPEND ON SUBSTANTIAL EXTERNAL FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE FOR THE NEXT YEAR AS ITS CAPACITY TO IMPORT </p><p>COMMERCIALLY IS HIGHLY CONSTRAINED. </p><p> </p><p>3. SINCE 1995 WFP HAS DELIVERED ABOUT 3 MILLION TONNES OF </p><p>FOOD AID, MOSTLY CEREALS, TO THE DPRK. FOR 2002, UNDER </p><p>EMERGENCY OPERATION 10141.0, THE PROVISION OF 611,000 TONNES </p><p>OF FOOD AID WAS APPROVED TO ASSIST 6.4 MILLION PEOPLE AT A </p><p>TOTAL COST TO WFP OF USD 215.8 MILLION.  HOWEVER, THE </p><p>OPERATION REMAINED LARGELY UNDER RESOURCED THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>YEAR.  BY THE END OF 2002, LESS THAN 450,000 TONNES WILL </p><p>HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED.  WFP FOOD SHORTAGES HAVE BECOME MOST </p><p>ACUTE IN THE LAST QUARTER OF THE YEAR AND, WITH FEW PLEDGES </p><p>MADE IN LATE 2002 FOR ARRIVAL IN 2003, THERE WILL BE VERY </p><p>LIMITED CARRY-OVER STOCKS.  BY NOVEMBER, NEARLY 3 MILLION </p><p>NURSERY, KINDERGARTEN, PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL </p><p>CHILDREN, AS WELL AS PREGNANT AND NURSING WOMEN - ALL ON THE </p><p>WEST COAST - WERE DENIED WFP RATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>WFP\'S PROPOSED 2003 EMOP </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.

WFP\'S PROGRAMME WILL CONTINUE TO TARGET SPECIFIC GROUPS </p><p>WITHIN THE POPULATION, WHO HAVE SPECIAL DIETARY NEEDS AND/OR </p><p>HAVE NO WAY OF MEETING THEIR OWN MINIMUM ENERGY REQUIREMENTS </p><p>AND SOME OF THEIR MICRO-NUTRIENT NEEDS.  THESE INCLUDE </p><p>CHILDREN FROM 6 MONTHS TO 10 YEARS, PREGNANT AND NURSING </p><p>WOMEN, THE ELDERLY AND THOSE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY </p><p>NATURAL DISASTERS AND THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.  IN 2003, WFP </p><p>WILL SHIFT ITS TARGETING MORE TOWARDS THOSE DEPENDENT ON THE </p><p>PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, RESIDING PREDOMINANTLY IN URBAN </p><p>AREAS.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ORPHANS, WFP WILL  EXCLUDE </p><p>FROM ITS COVERAGE RESIDENTS OF CENTRAL PYONGYANG. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>WFP ACCESS AND MONITORING </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. WFP\'S POLICY OF "NO ACCESS, NO FOOD" WILL CONTINUE.  THIS </p><p>MEANS THAT ONLY THOSE COUNTIES/DISTRICTS WHERE WFP IS </p><p>GRANTED ACCESS WILL RECEIVE DISTRIBUTIONS.  DUE TO CHANGES </p><p>IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE SET-UP OF HAMHUNG CITY ANNOUNCED BY </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT IN LATE 2001, SEVEN DISTRICTS WERE MERGED </p><p>INTO TWO - HAMHUNG AND HUNGNAM CITIES.  THE ACCESSIBLE </p><p>COUNTIES AND TOTAL COUNTIES FIGURES WERE THUS ADJUSTED (I.E. </p><p>EACH REDUCED BY FIVE) TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE.  THEREFORE, </p><p>WFP CURRENTLY HAS ACCESS TO 163 OUT OF 206 </p><p>COUNTIES/DISTRICTS.  THIS ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 87 PERCENT OF </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05830  02 OF 03  031556Z </p><p>WHAT IS BELIEVED TO BE THE COUNTRY\'S TOTAL CIVILIAN </p><p>POPULATION OF 22.6 MILLION. </p><p> </p><p>8. NO NEW COUNTIES WERE OPENED TO WFP DURING 2002.  THE MOST </p><p>RECENT COUNTY TO BE DECLARED ACCESSIBLE - SAKJU, IN NORTH </p><p>PYONGAN PROVINCE - WAS DONE SO IN OCTOBER 2001.  WFP REMAINS </p><p>HIGHLY CONCERNED FOR THE PLIGHT OF POPULATION IN </p><p>INACCESSIBLE COUNTIES, AND IN 2003, WFP WILL CONTINUE ITS </p><p>EFFORTS TO GAIN ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL COUNTIES. </p><p> </p><p>9. WFP WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO SEEK WIDER ACCESS TO </p><p>INFORMATION ON FARMERS\' MARKETS AND PRICES IN ORDER TO </p><p>ACHIEVE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE HOUSEHOLD FOOD </p><p>SECURITY SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.
