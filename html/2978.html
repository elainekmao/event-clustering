<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000976 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>BEIJING PASS CHENGDU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PHUM, PREL, NP, Tibetan Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON TIBETAN REFUGEES </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 497 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski, Reasons 1.5 (b), (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  The Tibet border is "very quiet" and most </p><p>newly arrived refugees have not faced problems, according to </p><p>UNHCR and the Office of Tibet.  Nepali police garnered praise </p><p>for their efforts to escort a large group of Tibetans from </p><p>the Nangpa region to Kathmandu, an operation which UNHCR </p><p>hopes marks a return to "normal procedures."  News of the </p><p>troubling security situation in Nepal could be a factor in </p><p>the decline of refugee arrivals, UNHCR believes.  Lawyers </p><p>from a leading human rights organization plan to litigate the </p><p>case of eleven Tibetan refugees from India jailed on </p><p>immigration violations.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Return to "Normal Procedures" as Police Escort 29 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The refugee situation on the Tibet border is "very </p><p>quiet," according to both a UNHCR protection officer and the </p><p>Office of Tibet representative.  Most new arrivals have not </p><p>faced any problems.  During the week of May 12, police </p><p>escorted a group of 29 refugees from the Amdo region of Tibet </p><p>to Kathmandu without incident, UNHCR confirmed.  The group </p><p>had crossed into Nepal at Nangpa Pass.  The Office of Tibet </p><p>was "pleasantly surprised" to learn that the police treated </p><p>the group very well and even provided them with food and </p><p>water.  UNHCR noted that recently there have been few </p><p>instances of police escorting Tibetan refugees to the </p><p>capital.  UNHCR hoped that last week\'s incident marked a </p><p>return to the "normal procedures" previously in effect. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Tibet Office noted that in the previous week a </p><p>small group of five or six crossing at Nangpa Pass had been </p><p>robbed of all their money.  Even so, this group was able to </p><p>reach Kathmandu for onward processing. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The number of new arrivals at the Tibetan Reception </p><p>Center in Kathamndu continues to be off compared to previous </p><p>years.  UNHCR Kathmandu commented May 20 that explanations </p><p>for the decline vary, but it could be that people in Tibet </p><p>have heard news of the troubling security situation in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>Still No Prospects for Eleven Jailed Tibetans </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) There has been no change in the status of eleven </p><p>Tibetan refugees from India jailed by Nepal on immigration </p><p>charges (Reftel).  Lawyers from the Human Rights Organization </p><p>of Nepal (HURON) see litigation as the only possible solution </p><p>and plan to take the case to court. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
