<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005131 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR TUCKER ASKEW </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: APPREHENSION AND RESIGNATION:  A SENIOR JORDANIAN </p><p>ON THE U.S. AND IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 169304 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 4719 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  In an off the record session of the Amman World </p><p>Affairs Council attended by A/DCM on September 2, Royal Court </p><p>Chief Fayez Tarawneh gave the mostly East Bank audience one </p><p>of the most frank assessments of GOJ thinking on Iraq that we </p><p>have heard.  After being peppered by leading questions on the </p><p>strength of Jordanian support for Palestinians and opposition </p><p>to military action on Iraq, Tarawneh responded forcefully </p><p>with the GOJ\'s emerging "Jordan first" public line.  "I hear </p><p>about the Palestinian question; I hear about the Iraqi </p><p>question; but I never hear about the Jordanian question. </p><p>What about our interests?  Can we not be concerned about what </p><p>is best for Jordan?" </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  When asked if Jordan could influence a U.S. decision </p><p>to attack Iraq, Tarawneh said "of course we can influence the </p><p>U.S.  We are telling them (the Americans) about the great </p><p>economic and political impact that any attack on Iraq will </p><p>have on us here and about the great risk to stability in the </p><p>region.  However, the U.S. will make its final decision based </p><p>on its own interests, not on ours.  We are only one small </p><p>voice."  When the questioner pressed Tarawneh on whether the </p><p>GOJ had objected strongly enough to a U.S. strike, Tarawneh </p><p>shot back "If the U.S. decides to attack Baghdad, what are we </p><p>supposed to do?  Put up our F-16s so they can be shot down? </p><p>Should we commit suicide?" </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  When asked how Jordan calculates its interests in </p><p>the region, Tarawneh responded with a barrage of regional and </p><p>international trade data, ending by saying that combined U.S. </p><p>assistance to Jordan and Jordanian exports to the U.S. may </p><p>approach USD 1 billion this year.  "Like it or not," Tarawneh </p><p>concluded, "the U.S. is now economically more important for </p><p>us than Iraq.  We cannot ignore this fact.  Do other elements </p><p>go into our calculation?  Of course they do.  But American </p><p>trade and assistance help the lives of Jordanians and provide </p><p>them jobs." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  COMMENT:  Tarawneh\'s comments in this semi-public </p><p>forum show clearly the dilemma facing GOJ officials:  they </p><p>fear the consequences of any U.S. military action in Iraq, </p><p>but they do not want (and cannot afford) to jeopardize </p><p>Jordan\'s very close relations with the U.S.  The "Jordan </p><p>First" mantra is also a way to prepare the Jordanian public </p><p>for the nuances of the government\'s policy on Iraq in coming </p><p>months, building on the King\'s address to the nation August </p><p>15 (ref b).  As government officials frequently say in </p><p>private, "This is not 1990." </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
