SUMMARY:  LOCAL MEDIA CONTINUED TO COMMENT NEGATIVELY ON </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.  ONE EDITORIAL </p><p>CALLED FOR AN ARAB SUMMIT TO ELIMINATE THE NEW INTERNATIONAL LAW </p><p>OF THE JUNGLE.  ANOTHER EDITORIAL CLAIMED THAT AMERICA IS THE </p><p>ONLY NATION THAT PREVIOUSLY USED NUCLEAR AND OTHER </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY BANNED WEAPONS.  OTHER EDITORIALS NOTED THAT </p><p>BUSH\'S JUSTIFICATIONS FOR WAR ON IRAQ ARE NEITHER CONVINCING OR </p><p>TRUTHFUL.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON AN ARAB POSITION NEEDED TO AVERT WAR IN IRAQ, </p><p>SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/1: </p><p> </p><p>"...AN ARAB SUMMIT [IS NEEDED] THAT AIMS TO PROTECT [OUR] DESTINY </p><p>AND SPARES ARABS, AND THEIR FUTURE, GRAVE CONSEQUENCES.  WHAT IS </p><p>NEEDED NOW IS TO HAVE THE WILL TO ELIMINATE THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE </p><p>PROMOTED BY BUSH, BLAIR, AND SHARON. </p><p> </p><p>3.  CHIEF EDITOR OF THE BUSINESS-ORIENTED DUBAI-BASED ARABIC </p><p>DAILY "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/1: </p><p> </p><p>"...AMERICA IS THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD THAT USED ATOMIC </p><p>BOMBS TO DESTROY THE JAPANESE CITIES OF NAGASAKI AND HIROSHIMA. </p><p>AMERICA HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED THIS IN AFGHANISTAN AND VIOLATED THE </p><p>GENEVA TREATIES REGARDING INTERNATIONALLY BANNED WEAPONS ... IN </p><p>HIS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS PRESIDENT BUSH DELIVERED A MESSAGE </p><p>OF WAR ..." </p><p> </p><p>4.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "GIVE US YOUR EVIDENCE," ABU DHABI-BASED </p><p>PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL-ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON 2/1: </p><p> </p><p>"... WASHINGTON ENDEAVORS TO FABRICATE JUSTIFICATIONS TO LEGALIZE </p><p>ITS ILLEGAL WAR AGAINST IRAQ DESPITE THE SWEEPING GLOBAL </p><p>OPPOSITION FOUND EVEN INSIDE AMERICA ITSELF.  COMMENTING ON </p><p>BUSH\'S WAR PLANS, CONGRESSMAN TED KENNEDY SAID THAT AMERICA HAS </p><p>TURNED FROM A MODEL OF FREEDOM INTO A SYMBOL OF AGGRESSION AND </p><p>TYRANNY.  A CONGRESS MEMBER AND NOT AN IRAQI PARLIAMENTARIAN MADE </p><p>THIS COMMENT." </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "PROOF LACKS TRUTH", "AL-KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 2/2: </p><p> </p><p>"IT IS SO CLEAR THAT THE U.S. IS SEARCHING FOR ANY CLAIMS, NO </p><p>MATTER HOW TRIVIAL AND DEVOID OF TRUTH, TO JUSTIFY AN AGGRESSION </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ ... BASED ON THIS, ALL PROOF POWELL IS PRESENTING ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 5 TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL WILL BE FABRICATED </p><p>INTELLIGENCE DATA THAT WOULD DELUDE NO ONE.  THIS WAS ALSO THE </p><p>CASE IN BUSH\'S SPEECH FOLLOWING HIS MEETING WITH BLAIR ON A LINK </p><p>BETWEEN THE IRAQI REGIME AND THE 9/11 ATTACKS." </p><p> </p><p>WILLIAMS </p><p></p></div>
