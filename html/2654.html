(U) CLASSIFIED BY CONSUL GENERAL EMI LYNN YAMAUCHI, </p><p>HO CHI MINH CITY, FOR REASONS 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: A RELATIVELY MODERATE PASTOR FROM THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS SAID THE GVN IS WORKING TO IMPROVE </p><p>THE SITUATION FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES, ALTHOUGH PROBLEMS </p><p>REMAIN.  HE BELIEVES THE OVERWHELMING CAUSE OF </p><p>WIDESPREAD TENSIONS IS THE ECONOMIC DISPARITY BETWEEN </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITIES AND THE KINH VIETNAMESE MAJORITY. </p><p>HE CRITICIZED U.S. MONTAGNARD GROUPS WHO ENCOURAGE </p><p>PEOPLE TO LEAVE VIETNAM.  RETURNEES FROM THE REFUGEE </p><p>CAMPS IN CAMBODIA HAVE GENERALLY NOT BEEN PUNISHED, </p><p>EXCEPT FOR A FEW QINSTIGATORSQ WHO CONVINCED OTHERS TO </p><p>LEAVE.  HE STRESSED THE MEETING AND HIS IDENTITY </p><p>SHOULD BE KEPT SECRET.  SEPTEL REPORTS ON A BRIEF </p><p>SEPARATE DISCUSSION WITH HIS BROTHER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC DISPARITIES CAUSE TENSIONS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>3. (C) DPO AND CONOFF DISCUSSED CONDITIONS IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS MARCH 19 WITH A PROTESTANT PASTOR </p><p>FROM GIA LAI PROVINCE.  HE BELIEVES THE GVN\'S CURRENT </p><p>POLICIES TOWARD ETHNIC MINORITIES ARE GENERALLY BENIGN </p><p>AND WELL INTENTIONED.  THE POLICIES DEMONSTRATE THAT </p><p>THE GVN IS FINALLY INTERESTED IN PAYING ATTENTION TO </p><p>MINORITIES.  SOME LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE NOT ABIDED BY </p><p>THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT\'S POLICIES, BUT THE </p><p>OVERWHELMING CAUSE OF WIDESPREAD TENSIONS IS THE </p><p>ECONOMIC DISPARITY BETWEEN ETHNIC MINORITIES AND THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00652  01 OF 03  201147Z </p><p>KINH (VIETNAMESE) MAJORITY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE GVN\'S BASIC RELIGIOUS POLICIES ARE QUITE </p><p>GOOD.  INDIVIDUAL BELIEVERS CAN PRACTICE THEIR </p><p>RELIGION FREELY.  SOME PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, PERSIST. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS NO CHURCH IN THE PASTORQS </p><p>VILLAGE, ALTHOUGH THE BOARD HOPES TO BUILD A CHURCH IN </p><p>GIA LAI SOON. BELIEVERS ALSO FACE PROHIBITIONS ON </p><p>GATHERING TO DISCUSS THEIR FAITH OR TO PRAY TOGETHER. </p><p>THE REALITY OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, THEREFORE, IS THAT </p><p>ACTIVITIES ARE LIMITED TO THEIR HOMES.  BUT THE PASTOR </p><p>BELIEVES SUCH PROBLEMS ARE NOT SO EGREGIOUS THAT </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANTS MUST LEAVE VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE REAL COMPLAINT OF ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS IS ECONOMIC, NOT RELIGIOUS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE.  SPECIFICALLY, ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES ARE UPSET THAT THEIR LIVING CONDITIONS ARE </p><p>MUCH WORSE THAN THE KINH MAJORITY.  FREQUENTLY THERE </p><p>ARE LAND DISPUTES BETWEEN MINORITIES AND KINH, AND THE </p><p>REALITY IS THAT THE MINORITIES, BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR </p><p>AND NOT WELL CONNECTED, ALMOST ALWAYS LOSE IN LAND </p><p>DISPUTES WITH KINH.  THOSE MINORITIES WHO CAN STAND </p><p>SUCH SUFFERING REMAIN IN VIETNAM, WHILE OTHERS SEEK A </p><p>BETTER LIFE ELSEWHERE.  THIS LATTER GROUP IS EASY TO </p><p>EXPLOIT WITH PROMISES OF RESETTLEMENT TO THE U.S. OR A </p><p>FIGHT TO REGAIN THEIR LANDS. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ETHNIC MINORITIES WHO LEFT VIETNAM FOR </p><p>CAMBODIAN CAMPS FALL INTO FOUR CATEGORIES: (1) </p><p>POLITICAL ACTIVISTS; (2) RELIGIOUS ACTIVISTS; (3) </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00652  01 OF 03  201147Z </p><p>OPPORTUNISTS WHO HOPE TO RESETTLE IN THE U.S.; AND (4) </p><p>THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DUPED BY INDIVIDUALS BELONGING TO </p><p>CATEGORIES ONE AND TWO.  THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO </p><p>LEFT VIETNAM BELONG IN CATEGORY FOUR, AS DO ALMOST </p><p>EVERYONE WHO HAS RETURNED TO VIETNAM THUS FAR. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE REASON MANY PEOPLE LEFT VIETNAM IS THAT </p><p>THEY HEARD PROMISES FROM ETHNIC MINORITIES LIVING IN </p><p>THE U.S.--SPECIFICALLY SUPPORTERS OF KOK KQSOR, KQSOR </p><p>TAR AND KQSOR BLIK--OR THEIR ASSOCIATES IN VIETNAM. </p><p>THE PASTOR SAID IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER </p><p>THE PROMISES MADE ARE TRUTHFUL.  HE BELIEVES THE U.S. </p><p>GROUPS QHAVE CAUSED DISORDER FOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.Q  ONE OF THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>"MALEFACTORS" LINKED TO THE U.S.-BASED GROUP, A MR. </p><p>NGOL, TRIED TO CONVINCE OUR SOURCE TO LEAVE HIS </p><p>VILLAGE.  NGOL CLAIMED THAT IF MANY VILLAGERS FLED TO </p><p>CAMBODIA, THE U.S. AND UNHCR WOULD QHELP THE FIGHT TO </p><p>REGAIN LANDS TAKEN OVER BY THE KINH AND ESTABLISH AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT STATE.Q  (NOTE: WE CLARIFIED THAT QFIGHTQ </p><p>IN THIS CONTEXT MEANS AN ARMED UPRISING.)  HE ALSO </p><p>PROMISED MONEY AND A BETTER LIFE IN THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) LIFE IS NORMAL FOR MOST OF THOSE WHO HAVE </p><p>RETURNED FROM CAMBODIA.  IF THEY WERE DUPED, THEY ARE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8559 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00652  02 OF 03  201147Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01    FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------77E77F  201147Z /38 </p><p>O 201116Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5888 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BANGKOK </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HANOI 000652 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/PD/MSPEER </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR PRM </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00652  02 OF 03  201147Z </p><p>NOT PUNISHED OR DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.  A FEW PEOPLE </p><p>HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, BUT QTHEY DESERVE TO BE IN </p><p>DETENTION BECAUSE THEY LURED MANY PEOPLE TO LEAVE </p><p>THEIR VILLAGES.  THEIR DECEPTIONS CAUSED SOCIAL </p><p>DISHARMONY FOR THOSE WHO REMAINED BEHIND.Q  AT LEAST </p><p>ONE SUCH DECEIVER IS STILL IN CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) OUR SOURCE CONSIDERS IT NORMAL TO HAVE DISPUTES </p><p>WHEN DIFFERENT GROUPS LIVE TOGETHER.  THE SITUATION </p><p>BECAME MUCH MORE SERIOUS WHEN FULRO CALLED FOR AN </p><p>UPRISING TO TAKE BACK THE LAND.  THE RECENT SHIFT TO A </p><p>MARKET ECONOMY HAS MADE THINGS WORSE.  IN THE PAST </p><p>EVERYTHING WAS SUBSIDIZED.  NOW, THE MINORITIES ARE </p><p>BEING LEFT FARTHER BEHIND AND FEEL THEY CANQT CATCH </p><p>UP.  THE GVN HAS AGREED TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE, BUT IT </p><p>IS NOT ENOUGH YET. </p><p> </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS FOR PROTESTANTS, BUT PROBLEMS REMAIN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>10. (C) OUR SOURCE THINKS QNON-BELIEVERSQ  (NON- </p><p>CHRISTIANS) GET MORE HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAN </p><p>BELIEVERS.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR EDUCATION.  HE </p><p>ASKED THE HEAD OF THE GIA LAI PEOPLEQS COMMITTEE WHY </p><p>THERE WERE NO PROTESTANT STUDENTS IN ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>BOARDING SCHOOLS.  HE WAS TOLD THE SCHOOLS WERE </p><p>DESIGNED TO TRAIN FUTURE OFFICIALS FOR THE ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY COMMUNITY.  OTHER LOCAL OFFICIALS TOLD HIM </p><p>THAT AS LONG AS RESOURCES WERE SO SCARCE, THE SCHOOLS </p><p>WOULD FAVOR THE CHILDREN OF LOCAL MINORITY OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) CONDITIONS FOR PROTESTANTS HAVE IMPROVED SINCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00652  02 OF 03  201147Z </p><p>THE PROTESTANT CHURCH OF VIETNAM (SOUTH) (PCVS) WAS </p><p>RECOGNIZED.  BEFORE PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED FOR PRAYING </p><p>(INCLUDING OUR SOURCE IN 1992).  AS RECENTLY AS 1999, </p><p>THEY WERE OFTEN QINVITEDQ TO SPEAK WITH THE LOCAL </p><p>POLICE.  OUR SOURCE KNEW OF NO SUCH HARASSMENT IN 2001 </p><p>OR THIS YEAR.  ALTHOUGH THE LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTY AND </p><p>PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT HAVE SHOWN MORE UNDERSTANDING </p><p>LATELY, THEY HAVE ONLY ALLOWED A SMALL NUMBER OF </p><p>OFFICIAL PASTORS AND PARISHES/DIOCESES TO BE </p><p>ESTABLISHED SINCE THE PCVS WAS RECOGNIZED.  QWE </p><p>EXPECTED A LOT BUT HAVE ONLY BEEN ALLOWED A LITTLE.Q </p><p>THE SITUATION VARIES BY PROVINCE: GIA LAI IS A QLITTLE </p><p>BITQ BETTER THAN DAK LAK.  KON TUM IS THE MOST </p><p>DIFFICULT.  LAM DONG, THE FOURTH CENTRAL HIGHLAND </p><p>PROVINCE, IS QTOTALLY DIFFERENT,Q WITH OVER 100 </p><p>PASTORS. </p><p> </p><p>IS IT SAFE TO RETURN? </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>12. (C) DURING THE MEETING, OUR SOURCE RECEIVED A </p><p>PHONE REPORT REGARDING TWO PASTORS AND THE WIFE OF A </p><p>PASTOR WHO WERE PART OF A DELEGATION THAT ACCOMPANIED </p><p>A GROUP OF RETURNEES FROM THE MONDOLKIRI CAMP TO DAK </p><p>LAK PROVINCE.  THEY SAID LIFE WAS VERY DIFFICULT IN </p><p>THE CAMP AND THAT MANY MORE PEOPLE THERE WANTED TO </p><p>RETURN.  OUR SOURCE SAID HE HAD PERSONALLY SPOKEN WITH </p><p>MANY PEOPLE WHO HAD ALREADY RETURNED.  THOSE WHO CAME </p><p>BACK IN AN QORDERLYQ FASHION HAD NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS. </p><p>SOME WHO RETURNED ON THEIR OWN -- BEFORE THE </p><p>TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED -- HAD BEEN ARRESTED </p><p>BY CAMBODIAN SOLDIERS AND TURNED OVER TO VIETNAMESE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00652  02 OF 03  201147Z </p><p>SOLDIERS.  THEY WERE BEATEN BY THE SOLDIERS ON BOTH </p><p>SIDES, BUT WERE NOT BEATEN AGAIN ONCE THEY RETURNED </p><p>HOME. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) OUR SOURCE HAD BEEN ASKED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>TO GO TO THE CAMPS TO URGE PEOPLE TO RETURN, BUT HE </p><p>REFUSED BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY </p><p>FOR THEIR DECISION TO RETURN.  HAD HE GONE, HE WOULD </p><p>HAVE TOLD THE REFUGEES TO FOLLOW THE BIBLE BUT ALSO BE </p><p>GOOD CITIZENS AND FOLLOW THE GOVERNMENT\'S LAWS.  HE </p><p>MIGHT TELL THEM ABOUT THE TRUE SITUATION AT HOME -- </p><p>THAT EVERYTHING IS BASICALLY NORMAL -- BUT HE WOULD </p><p>NOT TELL THEM WHAT TO DO.  THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT\'S </p><p>SAFE TO RETURN AND HE WOULD NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT </p><p>BEING UNSAFE. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) ASKED HOW IT MIGHT BE UNSAFE, HE REPLIED THAT </p><p>THOSE WHO CROSSED THE BORDER CAUSED INSTABILITY.  WHEN </p><p>THEY RETURN, HE THINKS THAT THEY WILL BE WATCHED </p><p>CLOSELY.  AS FOR THOSE WHO CONVINCED OTHERS TO LEAVE, </p><p>HE BELIEVES THE AUTHORITIES WILL DEAL WITH THEM </p><p>QAPPROPRIATELY.Q  HE IS ALSO CONCERNED THAT OTHER </p><p>VILLAGERS WILL BE PREJUDICED AGAINST THOSE WHO LEFT, </p><p>COMPARING THIS TO A WOUND THAT LEAVES A SCAR BUT HEALS </p><p>AFTER A SHORT TIME.  IT WOULD BE WORSE IF PEOPLE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8561 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  00652  03 OF 03  201147Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01    FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------77E788  201147Z /38 </p><p>O 201116Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5889 </p><p>INFO USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BANGKOK </p><p>AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HANOI 000652 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/PD/MSPEER </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR PRM </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  00652  03 OF 03  201147Z </p><p>SETTLED IN THIRD COUNTRIES, SINCE THIS WOULD CAUSE </p><p>MORE PEOPLE TO LEAVE AND CREATE FURTHER INSTABILITY. </p><p>IN HIS OPINION, IT WOULD BE BEST FOR PEOPLE TO COME </p><p>HOME. </p><p> </p><p>GOOD INTENTIONS, BUT RHETORIC OUTPACES REFORM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>15. (C) OUR SOURCE SAID HE HAD CELEBRATED CHRISTMAS </p><p>WITHOUT INCIDENT.  ABOUT 150 BELIEVERS CAME TO HIS </p><p>HOUSE TO PRAY.  SOME LOCAL POLICE ARRIVED, BUT THEY </p><p>STAYED OUTSIDE AND DID NOT INTERFERE.  WHEN HE HAD A </p><p>CHRISTMAS PARTY, HE MADE A POINT OF INVITING SOME OF </p><p>THE LOCAL OFFICIALS INSIDE.  THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS. </p><p>THE SITUATION VARIED ACCORDING TO LOCALITY.  HE KNEW </p><p>OF ONE VILLAGE WHERE PEOPLE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO </p><p>GATHER AT CHRISTMAS.  IT WAS IN AN AREA WHERE THERE </p><p>HAD BEEN DEMONSTRATIONS IN FEBRUARY OF 2001, AFTER </p><p>WHICH SOME RESIDENTS HAD GONE TO CAMBODIA.  HE HAS </p><p>HEARD STORIES OF PROTESTANTS WHO WERE FORCED TO DRINK </p><p>PIG\'S BLOOD WITH WINE, BUT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THE </p><p>SOURCES AND NEVER WITNESSED SUCH TREATMENT HIMSELF. </p><p>HE THINKS THE PEOPLE THAT SPREAD THESE RUMORS HAVE </p><p>ULTERIOR MOTIVES. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) OUR SOURCE CONCLUDED THAT, IN HIS VIEW, THE </p><p>GVN IS TRYING TO IMPROVE ITS POLICIES TOWARDS ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES AND PROTESTANTS.  BUT RHETORIC OUTPACES </p><p>ACTUAL REFORMS.  HE THINKS RELIGIOUS LEADERS, WHEN </p><p>CONFRONTED WITH PROBLEMS, SHOULD SIT DOWN WITH </p><p>OFFICIALS TO WORK THINGS OUT.  THERE ARE TOO MANY </p><p>POLITICIANS, AND NOT ENOUGH FARMERS AND BUSINESSMEN, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00652  03 OF 03  201147Z </p><p>IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT.  THE MINORITIES IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>HIGHLANDS HAVE BEEN IGNORED SINCE BEFORE 1975.  EVEN </p><p>NOW THERE IS ALMOST NO WORK FOR THEM IN FACTORIES OR </p><p>ON THE COFFEE AND RUBBER PLANTATIONS.  THEY ARE LESS </p><p>EFFICIENT THAN ETHNIC KINH AND USUALLY GET FIRED FOR </p><p>THIS.  INSTEAD, THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN TRAINING.  AS FOR </p><p>EDUCATION, UNTIL THINGS CHANGE, PROTESTANTS SHOULD </p><p>QFAKE ITQ AND CHECK QNONBELIEVERQ ON THE ENTRANCE </p><p>FORMS. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) HE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE U.S.-BASED ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES BE MORE HELPFUL.  THEY SHOULD NOT TELL </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITIES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL HELP THEM </p><p>FIGHT TO REGAIN LAND FOR A DEGA STATE, WHICH CANNOT BE </p><p>ACHIEVED.  INSTEAD, THE U.S.-BASED GROUPS SHOULD </p><p>PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO DEVELOP THE ECONOMY AND IMPROVE </p><p>LIVING CONDITIONS FOR THE ETHNIC MINORITIES STILL IN </p><p>VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>18. (C) IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS INFORMATION ON THE </p><p>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  IT IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO </p><p>GENERALIZE FROM ANY SINGLE SOURCE SINCE LOCAL </p><p>CONDITIONS VARY WIDELY.  EVEN NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES </p><p>OFTEN DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT EACH OTHER.  THIS </p><p>SOURCE IS PART OF THE RECENTLY RECOGNIZED PCVS AND </p><p>CLEARLY FAVORS WORKING WITH THE GVN.  HE IS NOT </p><p>UNCRITICAL, HOWEVER, AND HE IS WELL PLACED TO PROVIDE </p><p>FIRST-HAND REPORTING.  HIS BASIC POINTS SEEM TO BE IN </p><p>LINE WITH OTHER CREDIBLE SOURCES.  ETHNIC MINORITIES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00652  03 OF 03  201147Z </p><p>IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS, MOST </p><p>OF THEM ECONOMIC.  THE GVN IS SUSPICIOUS OF ANY </p><p>ORGANIZED RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IF IT IS </p><p>TIED TO A FULRO PAST AND A DEGA STATE PRESENT.  YET </p><p>THERE IS CONSIDERABLE PERSONAL FREEDOM TO WORSHIP. </p><p>THERE ARE CASES OF INDIVIDUAL ABUSES, BUT SO FAR WE </p><p>HAVE NOT SEEN EVIDENCE OF WIDESPREAD FEAR OR SYSTEMIC </p><p>WHOLESALE REPRESSION. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
