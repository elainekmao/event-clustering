<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000622 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PF DOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IZ, PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Economic effect of war </p><p>      devastating" the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>      Herald" dedicated its March 27 editorial to denouncing </p><p>      the war to disarm Iraq, saying the invasion could sap </p><p>      the strength of the global economy for years to come. </p><p>      "Tougher times lie ahead unless ways are found to stop </p><p>      the war," the editorial warned.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Markets are bleeding profusely as U.S.-led troops </p><p>      drop bombs in Iraq, causing major economic </p><p>      reverberations throughout the whole world.  The Iraq </p><p>      invasion has so far proved disastrous, not only in </p><p>      terms of loss of life, but also on the global socio- </p><p>      economic landscape.  The U.S. arrogance, which it has </p><p>      once again demonstrated by ignoring peaceful and </p><p>      diplomatic resolution to the Iraq crisis, is having </p><p>      serious repercussions on the entire globe.  All the </p><p>      commodity, financial and equity markets are trembling </p><p>      and the global economy is already counting heavy </p><p>      losses, with only a week into the war. . .  As a direct </p><p>      result of the Iraqi crisis, world oil supply will </p><p>      dwindle substantially and the market is already feeling </p><p>      the jitters as reflected by the rise in oil prices </p><p>      since the war began last week. . .  Tougher times lie </p><p>      ahead unless ways are found to stop the war." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
