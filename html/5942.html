<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000371 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/EX, S/CT, CA, DS/DSS, </p><p>DS/IP/NEA, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII, CENTCOM FOR POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, AMGT, PREL, PTER, AADP, CASC, EAC, COUNTER TERRORISM </p><p>SUBJECT: SANAA EAC MEETING - 23 FEBRUARY 2003 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: RSO Tim Laas, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Begin summary: The Ambassador convened an EAC </p><p>meeting on February 23 to assess recent threat information </p><p>and discuss security-related issues.  Also mentioned was EAP </p><p>readiness and the need to prepare for a future conflict in </p><p>Iraq.  Key offices and personnel represented at the meeting </p><p>included: CHG, POL/ECON, CONS, ADMIN, PD, RSO, ORCA, OMC, SOC </p><p>YEMEN, RMO, FPD AND FBI.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The EAC began their discussion with a review of the </p><p>threat environment in light of the shooting of a British </p><p>defense contractor in Saudi Arabia.  EAC members noted that a </p><p>similar scenario could play out in Yemen.  Accordingly, the </p><p>EAC agreed that Mission personnel should again be urged to </p><p>vary their times and routes and avoid a predictable pattern </p><p>in any other way. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The EAC discussed the fact that the British Embassy </p><p>in Sanaa had drawn down to the to a minimal staff working out </p><p>of the Ambassador\'s residence.  According to the DCM this was </p><p>a pattern for British missions throughout the region, but </p><p>also reflected the British concern that their Chancery was </p><p>vulnerable because it lacked adequate standoff. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  The EAC noted that the U.S. mission granted </p><p>authorized departures for Embassy staff in Kuwait, Saudi </p><p>Arabia, Beirut, Syria, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem.  The Ambassador </p><p>asked the EAC if any members thought that American Embassy </p><p>Sanaa should consider requesting such a departure status at </p><p>this time.  The EAC unanimously recommended not requesting </p><p>authorized departure status at this time because the past has </p><p>been at high security alert for some time and has procedures </p><p>in place to manage the existing threat. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  EAC members were briefed about the large number of </p><p>FSN and Direct Hire American staff that had opted to receive </p><p>the Smallpox vaccination following excellent briefings </p><p>provided by a TDY State Department medical team in Sanaa. </p><p>The Ambassador noted that the likelihood of a biological </p><p>attack in Sanaa remained small but the potential existed for </p><p>someone regionally to become infected before traveling to </p><p>Yemen at which time he/she might expose inhabitants in Yemen </p><p>to the virus.  The RMO discussed the fact that Anthrax </p><p>inoculations would follow smallpox vaccinations at an </p><p>unspecified time in the future. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The Administrative Officer briefed the EAC that </p><p>Escape Masks being held by ROYG customs would be released </p><p>shortly.  The RSO noted that a training team was scheduled to </p><p>train Embassy personnel beginning on March 10, 2003.  (Note </p><p>the masks were in fact released to the Embassy on February </p><p>24.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  The DCM briefed EAC members on the success of First </p><p>Responder Training recently provided by the RMO. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  The RSO informed the EAC team that the EAP had been </p><p>finalized by TDY RSO Nick Mariano and was ready for EAC </p><p>Chairman review and approval before send-out. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  The DCM reminded EAC members about the newly updated </p><p>phone tree to be used in the event of a crisis. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU)  The DCM invited SOC-Yemen and other EAC members to </p><p>review and provide input into the recently revised Drawdown </p><p>List updated by the DCM, ADMOFF, COMSOFF and RSO. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU)  EAC members reviewed tentative "Hunker Down" </p><p>Guidelines in the event of hostilities between the U.S. led </p><p>coalition and Iraq.  Subjects covered included: </p><p> </p><p>     Sleeping Arrangements </p><p>     FSN Access </p><p>     Cafeteria </p><p>     Reminder to bring overnight bag to office NOW </p><p>     Have cash on hand </p><p>     Update POA as necessary </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU)  The EAC noted the success of a Safe Haven Drill </p><p>administered by the RSO on 20 February at 0900 hours with the </p><p>entire Embassy staff. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU)  The RSO noted that a Destruction Drill would be </p><p>held on February 25, 2003.
