REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) ZANU-PF HAS ESCALATED ITS INTIMIDATION OF OPPOSITION MDC </p><p>LEADERS AND SUPPORTERS, AND IS MOVING TO ELIMINATE MANEUVERING </p><p>ROOM FOR ALL OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS THAT MIGHT </p><p>THREATEN THE RULING PARTY\'S CONTINUED HOLD ON POWER.  IN THE LAST </p><p>SEVERAL WEEKS, ZANU-PF OR THOSE ACTING ON ITS BEHALF HAVE RAIDED </p><p>THE MDC\'S OFFICES IN HARARE AND BULAWAYO; BEATEN SEVERAL </p><p>OPPOSITION MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND PEOPLE CLOSE TO THEM; </p><p>DESTROYED THE HOUSE OF AN MDC MP; TARGETED MDC SUPPORTERS IN </p><p>TERROR CAMPAIGNS NATIONWIDE; AND INTENSIFIED REPRESSION OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS.  ALL OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE PART OF THE </p><p>RULING PARTY\'S INCREASINGLY VICIOUS BUT WELL-COORDINATED STRATEGY </p><p>TO REMAIN IN POWER BEYOND THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  IT IS </p><p>IMPORTANT THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DO ALL IT CAN TO HALT </p><p>THIS ONCE-PROMISING COUNTRY\'S SLIDE TOWARD TOTALITARIANISM.  AN </p><p>IMPORTANT STARTING POINT IS TO MAKE THE UPCOMING ELECTION A FOCAL </p><p>POINT OF OUR DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS AND TO EMPHASIZE TO PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE AND HIS ADVISORS PRECISELY WHAT CONSEQUENCES THEY WILL FACE </p><p>IF THE ELECTION IS NOT FREE AND FAIR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>ESCALATING HARASSMENT OF MDC OFFICIALS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON JULY 5, THE DAY AFTER A NATIONAL TWO-DAY LABOR STAYAWAY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02171  01 OF 04  130953Z </p><p>SHUT DOWN MUCH OF ZIMBABWE, UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS DESCENDED ON </p><p>ONE OF THE OFFICES OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC </p><p>CHANGE (MDC) IN DOWNTOWN HARARE.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, THE </p><p>ARMED POLICE BLOCKED THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE BUILDING, SEARCHED </p><p>AND DEMANDED IDENTIFICATION FROM EVERYONE COMING IN AND OUT.  MDC </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE, WHO WAS IN THE OFFICE AT THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>TIME OF THE RAID, TOLD US THAT POLICE SAID THEY WERE LOOKING FOR </p><p>ARMS OF WAR AND FOR ZANU-PF YOUTH BEING HELD HOSTAGE AND TORTURED </p><p>ON-SITE.  THE POLICE HAD NO SEARCH WARRANT, BUT PROCEEDED TO </p><p>SEARCH THE PREMISES BEFORE DEPARTING.  THEY DID NOT ARREST ANYONE </p><p>OR CONFISCATE RECORDS OR EQUIPMENT.  NCUBE WAS ALMOST NONCHALANT </p><p>IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH US, SAYING THAT HE HAS COME TO EXPECT </p><p>SUCH HARASSMENT FROM THE SECURITY SERVICES ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE </p><p>RULING PARTY AND ANTICIPATED SIMILAR INCIDENTS IN THE RUN-UP TO </p><p>THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  (COMMENT:  THE MDC\'S LEADERSHIP </p><p>HAS GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO EMPHASIZE AND LIVE UP TO ITS </p><p>COMMITMENT TO PEACEFUL CHANGE AND TO AVOID REACTING TO REGULAR </p><p>PROVOCATIONS.  IN THAT CONTEXT, THE POLICE OFFICERS\' CLAIM TO BE </p><p>LOOKING FOR ARMS OF WAR AND TORTURE VICTIMS IS ABSURD, AND </p><p>CONFIRMS THAT THIS PARTICULAR ACTION WAS NOTHING MORE THAN </p><p>HARASSMENT.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON JULY 6, PLAINCLOTHES POLICE OFFICERS ENTERED THE MDC\'S </p><p>OFFICE IN BULAWAYO, ZIMBABWE\'S SECOND-LARGEST CITY.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>MDC MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT DAVID COLTART, THE POLICE, WHO WERE </p><p>EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE, HAD NEITHER A SEARCH WARRANT NOR AN ARREST </p><p>WARRANT BUT REFUSED TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY WERE THERE.  THEY ARRESTED </p><p>THE MDC\'S TREASURER, FLETCHER DULINI-NCUBE, AND AN MDC DRIVER, </p><p>KHETHANI SIBANDA, AND CONFISCATED A 10-TON TRUCK BELONGING TO THE </p><p>OPPOSITION PARTY.  DULINI-NCUBE WAS RELEASED SEVERAL HOURS LATER, </p><p>BUT SIBANDA REMAINED IN DETENTION UNTIL JULY 9, WHEN HE WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02171  01 OF 04  130953Z </p><p>RELEASED ON BAIL. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN OTHER ACTIONS, IT IS CLEAR THAT MDC MEMBERS OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT ARE BEING SINGLED OUT FOR PHYSICAL ABUSE AND THEIR </p><p>PROPERTY TARGETED FOR DESTRUCTION.  ON JULY 7, PAUL THEMBA NYATHI, </p><p>THE MDC\'S DIRECTOR OF ELECTIONS, WAS FORCED OFF THE ROAD IN </p><p>BULAWAYO BY A CAR WHICH HAD BEEN FOLLOWING HIM FOR SOME TIME.  HIS </p><p>CAR ROLLED OVER SEVERAL TIMES, BUT HE MIRACULOUSLY AVOIDED SERIOUS </p><p>INJURY.  ACCORDING TO NYATHI, FOUR MEN DISEMBARKED FROM THE </p><p>VEHICLE WHICH HAD RAMMED NYATHI\'S TO INSPECT THE ACCIDENT SCENE, </p><p>THEN SPED OFF. ON JUNE 23, A GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY 200 WAR </p><p>VETERANS (SOME OF WHOM WORE ZANU-PF T-SHIRTS) USED STONES, BRICKS, </p><p>AND BOTTLES TO DESTROY THE HOUSE OF MDC MP WILLIAS MADZIMURE, WHO </p><p>REPRESENTS THE HARARE HIGH-DENSITY SUBURB OF KAMBUZUMA.  MADZIMURE </p><p>TOLD US THAT POLICE HAVE TAKEN NO ACTION AGAINST THE PERPETRATORS, </p><p>WHO ARE WELL-KNOWN BUT CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE FREELY.  ON JUNE 27, </p><p>MADZIMURE WAS ASSAULTED BY A GROUP OF ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS WHILE IN </p><p>A POLICE STATION FILING A COMPLAINT.  NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN </p><p>THAT INCIDENT.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, A SHOP OWNED BY MDC MP </p><p>JOB SIKHALA, WHO HAS BEEN BEATEN TWICE THIS YEAR BY ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS, WAS RANSACKED ON JUNE 27 BY 15 PEOPLE CARRYING AXES, </p><p>STICKS, BRICKS, AND STONES.  THE GROUP, LED BY A REPORTED ZANU-PF </p><p>ACTIVIST IN THE AREA, BEAT THE SHOP\'S TWO EMPLOYEES, ONE OF WHOM </p><p>REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4208 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02171  02 OF 04  130953Z </p><p>ACTION ECA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    JUSE-00  L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /009W </p><p>                  ------------------051A1B  130953Z /38 </p><p>O 130954Z JUL 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9302 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 002171 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 07/10/11 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE SLIDING OMINOUSLY TOWARD A POLICE STATE </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MDC SUPPORTERS ARE ALSO BEING TARGETED IN THE SWELLING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02171  02 OF 04  130953Z </p><p>WAVE OF GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED VIOLENCE.  IN THE HARARE HIGH- </p><p>DENSITY SUBURB OF EPWORTH, SIX PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE LAST </p><p>TWO WEEKS IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE PROVOKED BY SELF-STYLED WAR </p><p>VETERANS AND GOONS IN THE EMPLOY OF ZANU-PF.  THE LONG-SIMMERING </p><p>TENSIONS IN THIS TOWNSHIP HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED IN RECENT WEEKS BY </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS, WHO HAVE DRAGGED SUSPECTED MDC BACKERS OUT OF </p><p>THEIR HOMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND FORCED THEM TO WALK </p><p>SEVERAL KILOMETERS TO A BASE CAMP, WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN SEVERELY </p><p>BEATEN.  ON JULY 7, THREE MDC OFFICIALS WERE REPORTEDLY SERIOUSLY </p><p>INJURED IN RUSAPE, 170 KM SOUTHEAST OF HARARE, IN SEPARATE ATTACKS </p><p>ON THEM BY ZANU-PF YOUTHS.  THE RIGHT EYE OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS -- </p><p>NATION SAGWETE, THE MDC DISTRICT YOUTH CHAIRMAN FOR MAKONI EAST -- </p><p>WAS BLINDED IN THE SECOND ATTACK ON HIM IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS. </p><p>MEANWHILE ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS CONTINUE TO WAGE A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR </p><p>AGAINST RESIDENTS IN THE MASHONALAND CENTRAL CAPITAL OF BINDURA, </p><p>WHERE A PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTION IS SCHEDULED FOR JULY 28 AND 29. </p><p> </p><p>INCREASING REPRESSION OF COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE SITUATION ON COMMERCIAL FARMS NATIONWIDE IS HEATING </p><p>UP, AS THE GOVERNMENT APPEARS INTENT ON BEATING FARMERS -- IN SOME </p><p>CASES, QUITE LITERALLY -- INTO SUBMISSION.  DAVID HASLUCK, </p><p>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU), TOLD </p><p>ECON/COMMERCIAL CHIEF ON JULY 9 THAT THE ORCHESTRATED CAMPAIGN OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION TARGETING COMMERCIAL FARMERS HAS </p><p>INTENSIFIED IN RECENT WEEKS.  ACCORDING TO HASLUCK, THE GOZ HAD </p><p>RECENTLY ORDERED ITS GANGSTER MILITIA OF WAR VETERANS AND ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS (WHOSE TACTICS ARE BECOMING INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM </p><p>THOSE OF MUSSOLINI\'S BROWNSHIRTS) TO DELIVER A CLEAR MESSAGE TO </p><p>WHITE FARMERS THAT ANY RESISTANCE TO THE CHAOTIC LAND RESETTLEMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02171  02 OF 04  130953Z </p><p>PROGRAM WAS FUTILE AND WOULD ONLY RESULT IN INJURIES OR DEATH. </p><p>THE CFU DIRECTOR INFORMED US THAT 92-95% OF ALL WHITE-OWNED FARMS </p><p>IN ZIMBABWE HAVE NOW BEEN LISTED FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION, WITH </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AIMING FOR 100 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) SEVERAL RECENT INCIDENTS PROVIDE COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT </p><p>HASLUCK\'S SOURCES ARE RIGHT-ON IN THEIR ASSESSMENT OF A NEW GOZ </p><p>CAMPAIGN AGAINST FARM OWNERS.  IAIN KAY, A FARMER AND MDC ACTIVIST </p><p>RESIDENT IN MARONDERA, 75 KM SOUTHEAST OF HARARE, WAS HELD </p><p>HOSTAGE, ALONG WITH TWO NEIGHBORING FARMERS, IN HIS HOME FOR THREE </p><p>DAYS BY HOSTILE WAR VETERANS JULY 6-8.  LAST YEAR, KAY WAS </p><p>SEVERELY BEATEN AND LEFT FOR DEAD BY WAR VETERANS ANGRY THAT HE </p><p>HAD NOT BUILT SHACKS FOR SQUATTERS ON HIS PROPERTY.  IN THE MOST </p><p>RECENT INCIDENT, MDC MP DAVID COLTART TOLD US, A WELL-KNOWN </p><p>CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO) AGENT SUPERVISED THE </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THE WAR VETERANS, WHO ASSAULTED 20 OF KAY\'S FARM </p><p>WORKERS.  THEY ENTERED HIS HOUSE TWICE BUT WERE FORCED TO RETREAT </p><p>AFTER THE FARM OWNER FIRED A PISTOL INTO THE AIR.  THE WAR </p><p>VETERANS THREATENED TO KILL KAY IF HE DID NOT VACATE THE FARM </p><p>IMMEDIATELY.  THE TENSE STANDOFF WAS DEFUSED ON JULY 8 AFTER KAY </p><p>AND HIS NEIGHBORS WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE PREMISES, ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>WAR VETERANS HAVE INSISTED THEY WILL ASSUME CONTROL OF THE </p><p>PROPERTY WITHIN A MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) PHIL MATIBE, AN MDC ACTIVIST, COMMERCIAL FARMER, AND </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE IN THE JUNE 2000 POLLS, HAD HIS 650- </p><p>HECTARE FARM SEIZED AFTER HE REFUSED TO WITHDRAW HIS LEGAL </p><p>CHALLENGE OF ZANU-PF\'S VICTORY IN CHEGUTU.  THE VICTORIOUS ZANU-PF </p><p>CANDIDATE, WEBSTER SHAMU, HAD INSTRUCTED MATIBE TO WITHDRAW HIS </p><p>CHALLENGE OR HIS FARM WOULD BE SEIZED.  MATIBE TOLD POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION CHIEF THAT ON JUNE 7, THE DAY AFTER THE HIGH COURT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02171  02 OF 04  130953Z </p><p>SCHEDULED A DATE TO HEAR HIS CASE, A GROUP COMPRISING THE DISTRICT </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE WAR VETERANS, POLICE, </p><p>AND ZANU-PF APPEARED ON THE FARM AND GAVE MATIBE AND HIS FAMILY 24 </p><p>HOURS TO VACATE THE PREMISES.  (COMMENT:  THE FACT THAT MATIBE\'S </p><p>FARM HAD NOT BEEN LISTED FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION UNDER THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM, OR THAT HE IS BLACK, </p><p>DID NOT SEEM TO MATTER TO ANY OF THE GOZ PLAYERS.  END COMMENT.) </p><p>FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SQUATTER FAMILIES WERE DROPPED OFF SOON AFTER, </p><p>ERECTED TEMPORARY SHACKS, BURNED ALL OF HIS CROPS IN THE GROUND </p><p>(WHICH INCLUDED TOBACCO, BARLEY, AND MAIZE) AND DESTROYED MOST OF </p><p>THE INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE FARM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) ON JUNE 15, A MESSAGE WAS CONVEYED INDIRECTLY TO MATIBE </p><p>ORDERING HIM TO RESIGN FROM THE MDC AND TO WITHDRAW HIS LEGAL </p><p>CHALLENGE; OTHERWISE, HE AND HIS FAMILY WOULD FACE UNSPECIFIED </p><p>CONSEQUENCES.  ON JUNE 22, THE CIO PROVINCIAL DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>MASHONALAND WEST MET WITH MATIBE AND STATED EXPLICITLY THAT HE HAD </p><p>BEEN SENT AS AN ENVOY FROM PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S OFFICE.  THE CIO </p><p>DIRECTOR TOLD MATIBE THAT, IF HE WITHDREW HIS HIGH COURT PETITION, </p><p>HE COULD CHOOSE WHATEVER FARM HE WANTED ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY </p><p>AND THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BACK OFF IMMEDIATELY.  IF HE DECLINED THE </p><p>OFFER, THE ENVOY SAID, MATIBE WOULD BE CRUSHED.  THE SENIOR CIO </p><p>OFFICIAL CONTINUED THAT ZANU-PF WOULD ENSURE THAT ANY BUSINESS OR </p><p>OTHER ECONOMIC INITIATIVE MATIBE TRIED TO UNDERTAKE WOULD FAIL, </p><p>AND HIS PHYSICAL SECURITY AND THAT OF HIS FAMILY WOULD NOT BE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4211 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02171  03 OF 04  130954Z </p><p>ACTION ECA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    JUSE-00  L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /009W </p><p>                  ------------------051A2C  130954Z /38 </p><p>O 130954Z JUL 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9303 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 002171 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 07/10/11 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE SLIDING OMINOUSLY TOWARD A POLICE STATE </p><p> </p><p>GUARANTEED.

(COMMENT:  THE TREATMENT OF MATIBE PROVIDES THE MOST </p><p>GLARING EXAMPLE TO DATE THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAST TRACK </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM IS MORE ABOUT INTIMIDATING POLITICAL </p><p>OPPONENTS THAN RIGHTING HISTORICAL WRONGS OR EMPOWERING THE </p><p>PEASANTRY.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, WAR VETERANS AND ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS ARMED WITH SPEARS AND AXES WENT ON A RAMPAGE THE WEEK </p><p>OF JULY 2 IN MWENEZI, IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF MASVINGO, </p><p>BEATING UP FARM WORKERS WHOM THEY ACCUSED OF SUPPORTING THE MDC. </p><p>ONE BAFFLED FARMER IN THE AREA TOLD JOURNALISTS:  "IT IS VERY </p><p>DANGEROUS FOR US TO MOVE AROUND THE FARM BECAUSE THE WAR VETERANS </p><p>HAVE BECOME VERY HOSTILE.  THE WHOLE AREA HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A </p><p>BATTLEFIELD."  ON JULY 5, GROUPS OF AXE-WIELDING WAR VETERANS </p><p>REPORTEDLY BROUGHT THE TOWN OF PLUMTREE, A BORDER TOWN 100 KM </p><p>SOUTHWEST OF BULAWAYO, TO A STANDSTILL WHEN THEY HARASSED WORKERS </p><p>AT COMPANIES THEY ACCUSED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE JULY 3-4 </p><p>STAYAWAY ORGANIZED BY THE ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS </p><p>(ZCTU).  THE WAR VETERANS ALLEGEDLY THREATENED TO TAKE OVER THE </p><p>COMPANIES AND DEMANDED THE TRANSFER OF ALL OF THEIR MANAGERS.  ON </p><p>JULY 5, THE GAME RANCH OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WAS OCCUPIED BY WAR </p><p>VETERANS DROPPED OFF BY A POLICE LAND ROVER (REF A). </p><p> </p><p>DETENTION OF ZCTU SECRETARY-GENERAL </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) THE JULY 12 DETENTION OF WELLINGTON CHIBHEBHE, THE ZCTU\'S </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL, SIGNALED THE GOVERNMENT\'S UNHAPPINESS OVER THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>SUCCESS OF THE JULY 3-4 STAYAWAY AND ITS CONCERN OVER THREATS BY </p><p>THE LABOR ORGANIZATION TO CALL FOR AN INDEFINITE WORK STOPPAGE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02171  03 OF 04  130954Z </p><p>CHIBHEBHE WAS QUESTIONED FOR TWO HOURS BY POLICE, WHO ASKED ABOUT </p><p>HIS POLITICAL AFFILIATION, THE COMPOSITION OF THE ZCTU AND ITS </p><p>VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES, WHICH KEY FIGURES DECIDE TO </p><p>PROCEED WITH STAYAWAYS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ZCTU AND </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST ORGANIZATION.  ZCTU PRESIDENT LOVEMORE </p><p>MATOMBO CALLED THE QUESTIONING OF CHIBHEBHE "MERE HARASSMENT." </p><p>MDC SPOKESMAN LEARNMORE JONGWE HAD STRONGER WORDS, SAYING "THIS </p><p>HIGH-HANDEDNESS IN DEALING WITH LEGITIMATE DISSENT WILL NOT STOP </p><p>THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY FROM DEMANDING THAT THE ELECTED LEADERS </p><p>BEHAVE RESPONSIBLY." </p><p> </p><p>NEW CITIZENSHIP LAW </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U) ON JULY 6, PRESIDENT MUGABE SIGNED INTO LAW AN AMENDMENT </p><p>TO THE CITIZENSHIP ACT OF ZIMBABWE INTENDED TO STRENGTHEN ZANU- </p><p>PF\'S PROSPECTS IN THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS, ZIMBABWEANS HOLDING DUAL CITIZENSHIP </p><p>ARE REQUIRED TO RENOUNCE THEIR FOREIGN CITIZENSHIP WITHIN SIX </p><p>MONTHS OF THE ENACTMENT DATE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOREIGN </p><p>COUNTRY\'S LAWS.  PREVIOUSLY, ZIMBABWEANS HOLDING DUAL CITIZENSHIP </p><p>WERE ONLY REQUIRED TO RENOUNCE THEIR FOREIGN CITIZENSHIP UNDER </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN LAW, A RENUNCIATION WHICH SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES DID </p><p>NOT RECOGNIZE. </p><p> </p><p>13.
