REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary and Action Request:  The 14th bilateral </p><p>meeting between the Foreign Ministers of Nepal and Bhutan </p><p>concluded on May 22 without clarifying a number of crucial </p><p>issues, including the status of thousands of Bhutanese </p><p>refugees who must reapply for citizenship upon their return, </p><p>and the role of UNHCR in the repatriation process.  The two </p><p>governments plan to publish the results of the joint </p><p>verification report at the first refugee camp in June. </p><p>Although "logistical details" concerning repatriation are to </p><p>be addressed at the next ministerial, scheduled to be held in </p><p>August in Thimpu, key questions like where the refugees will </p><p>be resettled in Bhutan or what happens to those who do not </p><p>qualify for citizenship, do not appear to be on the agenda. </p><p>A rather optimistic timeline has the first refugees </p><p>repatriated to Bhutan in September.  The Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) is relying--we think somewhat naively--upon Bhutanese </p><p>"flexibility" and donor pressure to ensure that repatriation </p><p>proceeds smoothly.  Action Request:  Embassy requests that </p><p>the Department consider instructing embassies in Bhutanese </p><p>donor capitals to demarche their host governments to urge </p><p>Government of Bhutan to meet its commitments and engage the </p><p>UNHCR in repatriation.  A parallel demarche could be made </p><p>directly to Bhutanese officials in New Delhi.  End summary </p><p>and action request. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>GON HAILS 14TH MINISTERIAL A SUCCESS </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The 14th Ministerial Joint Committee Meeting between </p><p>the Foreign Ministers of Bhutan and Nepal to address the </p><p>Bhutanese refugee issue was held in Kathmandu from May 19 to </p><p>22.  The Ministerial adopted the findings of the Joint </p><p>Verification Team (JVT), which categorized the first 12,000 </p><p>refugees to be considered for possible repatriation to </p><p>Bhutan.  The Ministerial directed the JVT to verify the </p><p>status of 600 "absentee" refugees, to inform the 12,000 </p><p>residents of the first verified camp of the findings by </p><p>mid-June and to allow a two-week appeals process thereafter. </p><p>A 15th Ministerial, to be held in Thimpu from August 11-14, </p><p>will formally approve the JVT report.  Local press reports </p><p>quoted an unnamed Government of Nepal (GON) source </p><p>participating in the Ministerial as lauding the "significant" </p><p>progress toward resolution of the 13-year-old issue achieved </p><p>during the meeting. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>MOST RETURNEES MAY FACE CITIZENSHIP LIMBO </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) On May 23 poloff, accompanied by the First </p><p>Secretary from the UK Embassy, met with Dr. Madan Kumar </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Bhattarai, MFA Spokesman and Joint Secretary for South Asian </p><p>Affairs, for a readout on the Ministerial.  Bhattarai </p><p>sketched out a timeline for eventual repatriation of the </p><p>first tranche of verified returnees.  (Note:  Refugees were </p><p>"verified" to be in one of four categories: (i) those </p><p>forcibly evicted; (ii) those who voluntarily migrated; (iii) </p><p>non-Bhutanese; and (iv) criminals.  End note.)  The JVT will </p><p>announce the results of the first verification exercise in </p><p>Khundanabari Camp from June 8 to July 17 and will attempt to </p><p>verify the 600 refugees not present when the exercise was </p><p>conducted.  From June 18 to July 7, the JVT will accept </p><p>appeals from refugees disputing their categorization, </p><p>although only new "material evidence" will be reviewed.  From </p><p>July 8-31 the JVT will review the appeals and make </p><p>recommendations.  The 15th Ministerial (August 11-14) </p><p>meeting will be held in Thimpu to endorse the JVT\'s final </p><p>report and to address "logistical details" concerning </p><p>repatriation.  On August 25 the JVT will begin distributing </p><p>citizenship application forms and other documents to those </p><p>refugees in the second category who must reapply for </p><p>Bhutanese citizenship upon return.  If all goes according to </p><p>schedule, repatriation of the first tranche of returnees </p><p>could begin by September 25. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Bhattarai said that 75 percent of the refugees from </p><p>the first camp were determined to be Bhutanese eligible for </p><p>repatriation as members of either Categories I or II, which, </p><p>he indicated, is higher than what the GON had originally </p><p>anticipated (Ref E).  Because the overwhelming majority of </p><p>that number, he acknowledged, were determined to have </p><p>"voluntarily" migrated from Bhutan, they must reapply for </p><p>Bhutanese citizenship upon return.  Returnees from both </p><p>Categories I and II will go to "some camp for some </p><p>unspecified time," Bhattarai said; the questions of where and </p><p>for how long were not addressed in the latest Ministerial or </p><p>in any previous meeting.  The Government of Bhutan had </p><p>pledged in writing that returned refugees would be provided </p><p>some sort of "livelihood," Bhattarai confirmed, but no </p><p>further discussion of arrangements for their accommodation, </p><p>employment, or education has taken place.  Also not </p><p>discussed, apparently, was what might happen to Category II </p><p>returnees--the bulk of those to be repatriated--whose </p><p>reapplication for Bhutanese citizenship is ultimately turned </p><p>down.  Finally, the Ministerial did not take up the sticky </p><p>topic of UNHCR involvement in the repatriation process, </p><p>Bhattarai conceded.  When asked if these difficult questions </p><p>might be addressed in the August Ministerial, Bhattarai did </p><p>not seem hopeful. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>"TICKLISH" PROBLEM:  WHAT TO DO </p><p>WITH THOSE WHO WON\'T GO BACK </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Because all repatriation must be voluntary, the GON </p><p>is prepared to allow those refugees not wishing to return to </p><p>Bhutan to apply for Nepali citizenship, Bhattarai reported. </p><p>Poloff asked on what basis citizenship might be granted, </p><p>since under current law only the children of Nepali citizen </p><p>fathers qualify. (Note:  Even children born in Nepal of </p><p>Nepali citizen mothers do not qualify for citizenship if </p><p>their fathers are foreign.  End note.)  Bhattarai </p><p>acknowledged the legal hurdle, but reiterated that the GON </p><p>nonetheless has offered to allow the refugees to apply for </p><p>citizenship to address this "ticklish" problem. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>SUPPORT FROM DONORS, INDIANS NEEDED </p><p>TO ENSURE BHUTANESE "FLEXIBILITY" </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Poloff and the representative from the British </p><p>Embassy expressed concern that so many details, certain to be </p><p>important to refugees contemplating returning to Bhutan after </p><p>more than a decade, had been left unanswered.  They </p><p>speculated that the refugees would surely want information on </p><p>where they would be living, what they would be doing for a </p><p>living, whether their children would be educated, and some </p><p>assurance of international oversight of the repatriation </p><p>process before making a final decision.  Delegations from the </p><p>camps already have raised these questions and others in a </p><p>number of meetings with the diplomatic community in </p><p>Kathmandu, the emboffs noted.  If members of the first </p><p>tranche find inhospitable conditions upon their return to </p><p>Bhutan, word will get back to the rest of the camps, possibly </p><p>discouraging others from applying for repatriation and </p><p>leaving Nepal with a greater number of refugees to absorb, </p><p>they cautioned.  Poloff suggested that the international </p><p>community might find it difficult to support a repatriation </p><p>process that did not make provision for such oversight, a </p><p>role best performed by UNHCR.  (Note:  UNHCR in Kathmandu </p><p>confirmed to the Embassy on May 28 that the Government of </p><p>Bhutan has still not extended an invitation to special envoy </p><p>Jahanshah Assadi to visit.  End note.)  Bhattarai responded </p><p>that the Bhutanese had "privately assured" the GON of their </p><p>good faith in providing for returnees, as well as their </p><p>"flexibility" in applying their generally rigorous standards </p><p>for citizenship to refugees.  The Bhutanese Foreign Minister </p><p>had expressly asked his Nepali counterpart that questions </p><p>about the resettlement process in Bhutan "be left to the </p><p>Bhutanese side," Bhattarai said.  Pressure from the donor </p><p>community and the Government of India will be critical to </p><p>ensuring that Bhutan keep to its commitments, he concluded. </p><p>(MFA Foreign Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya urged the same </p><p>point to CDA on May 26.) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  After more than a year of no progress, the GON seems </p><p>pleased to have an agreement that, at least in theory, allows </p><p>for the repatriation of most of the refugees.  It seems </p><p>doubtful to us, however, that the refugees will feel </p><p>reassured by a repatriation process the implementation of </p><p>which is left exclusively to the same government that </p><p>expelled them 13 years earlier.  Our views are shared by our </p><p>colleagues in the diplomatic community, including the </p><p>British, the Germans, and the EU.  Given the number of </p><p>unknowns confronting prospective returnees--especially the </p><p>majority who are deemed to have forfeited Bhutanese </p><p>citizenship by "voluntarily" migrating--it seems difficult to </p><p>believe that a significant number will agree to go back.  We </p><p>are especially concerned that both governments seem prepared </p><p>to initiate a process that appears to exclude UNHCR.  The GON </p><p>is clearly looking to the international community (including </p><p>the Indians) to use its influence to hold the Bhutanese to </p><p>their commitment to conduct a good-faith repatriation effort. </p><p> At a minimum, we believe that effort must include a role for </p><p>UNHCR. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Demarche Request:  Embassy requests that the </p><p>Department instruct embassies in Bhutanese donor capitals to </p><p>demarche host nation governments to urge the Government of </p><p>Bhutan (GOB) to fulfill its bilateral commitment to </p><p>repatriation.  The GOB should be further encouraged to permit </p><p>full UNHCR involvement in the process, starting with a visit </p><p>by the UNHCR special envoy, to ensure compliance with </p><p>international human rights standards.  Embassy further </p><p>requests that the Department consider a parallel demarche to </p><p>GOB officials in New Delhi. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
