<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002830 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL/AAE, AF/W AND PM </p><p>. </p><p>TREASURY FOR ATF INTERNATIONAL TRAINING BRANCH (CLOWRY) </p><p>. </p><p>CUSTOMS FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAINING DIVISION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, MARR, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FIREARMS INTERDICTION TRAINING A HIT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- Protect Accordingly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) SUMMARY:  A September 23-27 course on firearms and </p><p>explosives identification and interdiction conducted in </p><p>Katsina by ATF and U.S. Customs trainers will help support </p><p>Nigeria\'s border controls and its commitment to the ECOWAS </p><p>Moratorium on Small Arms and Light Weapons.  Fify-five law </p><p>enforcement officers from five agencies stationed in </p><p>Nigeria\'s seven northern states with international borders, </p><p>attended the course funded by INL and organized by the INL </p><p>office in Nigeria.  Remaining INL funds for the ATF effort </p><p>will be used for a course in Lagos for border security </p><p>officials stationed in the southern states and possibly a </p><p>third iteration with a regional scope to include border </p><p>security officials from Togo, Benin, Ghana, Niger, Chad and </p><p>Cameron.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND -- THE ECOWAS CONTEXT </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) The ATF/U.S. Customs course is a product of </p><p>consultations between the Embassy and the GON\'s Ministry of </p><p>Cooperation and Integration in Africa (MCIA), which </p><p>coordinates an interagency body to implement the 1998 ECOWAS </p><p>Moratorium on Small Arms and Light Weapons.  In addition to </p><p>interdiction of illegal weapons, this body -- the National </p><p>Committee on Small Arms (NATCOM) -- seeks to create national </p><p>mechanisms for licensing and tracing legally-owned firearms </p><p>and conducting educational campaigns to curb the use of </p><p>weapons in communal or other internal conflicts in Nigeria. </p><p>During an introductory meeting in early 2002, the NATCOM </p><p>highlighted for RNLEO the need for physical security training </p><p>to strengthen interdiction efforts at the country\'s land </p><p>borders.  Support from INL and ATF\'s International Training </p><p>Branch helped reprogram existing INL training funds to meet </p><p>this need. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KATSINA -- THE SETTING </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(U) During an early August assessment visit to Abuja, </p><p>senior ATF trainer Patrick Clowry, RNLEO and NATCOM members </p><p>selected Katsina as the best venue for the training of </p><p>security officials in Nigeria\'s northern region.  Katsina </p><p>offered a large, relatively well-equipped hotel and is </p><p>centrally located among the seven states forming Nigeria\'s </p><p>northern geopolitical zone -- Borno, Kebbi, Katsina, Sokoto, </p><p>Zamfara, Jigawa, and Yobe States.  No participating state was </p><p>more than a five-hour drive from Katsina, and taken together </p><p>from the perimeter of Nigeria\'s expansive northern borders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(U) Participants were selected from key law enforcement </p><p>agencies charged with interdicting arms and contraband at </p><p>land borders and stationed in the seven states -- the Nigeria </p><p>Customs Service (NCS), the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), </p><p>the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), the Nigeria </p><p>Police and the State Security Service (SSS).  The USG </p><p>trainers adjusted to the remoteness of Katsina and attendant </p><p>challenges with good spirit and participants repeatedly </p><p>thanked them for making the journey to Katsina. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(U) This was the first ever USG law enforcement project </p><p>held in Katsina was warmly welcomed by the State Governor and </p><p>local officials.  In an opening statement, the Secretary to </p><p>the State Governor underscored Nigeria\'s serious problem of </p><p>violent crime, which has been fueled by smuggled weapons.  He </p><p>also noted the connection between weapons trafficking and </p><p>terrorism, expressing solidarity with the USG\'s fight against </p><p>terrorism, marked by the first anniversary of the September </p><p>11 attacks two weeks earlier. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COURSE CONTENT </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(U) ATF trainers Clowry, Jeffrey McGee, Eugene Fleming and </p><p>U.S. Customs agents Carolyn Okafor and Ronald Branch </p><p>alternated in presenting course sessions on: identifying </p><p>types of weapons most often smuggled in the region and </p><p>tracing (when possible) their origins; concealment </p><p>techniques; searching vehicles and cargo; explosives </p><p>components and identification; and methods of interdicting </p><p>and disarming guns and small arms traffickers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.(U) On September 26 participants and trainers boarded buses </p><p>for a practical exercise in nearby Jibiya, Katsina State -- </p><p>the Nigerian Government\'s busiest border post with Niger.  At </p><p>Jibiya, the U.S. Customs agents, using a borrowed vehicle </p><p>from the NDLEA, demonstrated possible concealment methods for </p><p>smuggling weapons into Nigeria by vehicle over land borders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NIGER OFFICIALS MAKE A CAMEO APPEARANCE </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8(U) Customs officials from Niger were present at the opening </p><p>of this practical exercise and Nigerien Central Inspector </p><p>Mohammed A. Abdourahamane expressed interest (speaking in </p><p>Hausa, the common language of the region) in expanded border </p><p>control cooperation with Nigeria and in assistance from the </p><p>USG.  The USG team discovered that current cooperation among </p><p>Customs, Immigration and other security officials of the two </p><p>countries is limited because of the lack of telephone lines </p><p>on either side of the border.  The American visitors </p><p>expressed hope that a future iteration of the course could be </p><p>offered to regional participants, of which Niger officials </p><p>would play a key role.  Chad would also be a prime candidate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT AND KUDOS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.(SBU) Delivering this course near the heart of Northern </p><p>Nigeria in a city with a small but noticeable fundamentalist </p><p>presence (reported septel) provided considerable logistical </p><p>and security challenges but proved to be key in enhancing the </p><p>impact of the training.  By bringing training in the field, </p><p>instead of asking trainees to travel to Abuja or Lagos, the </p><p>ATF/USCS course was able to capture a larger number of </p><p>working-level security agents who can best use these </p><p>interdiction skills.  This also allowed for substantial </p><p>savings in costs, which would have been 50-100% higher in </p><p>Abuja or Lagos.  The Embassy wishes to thank U.S.-based ATF </p><p>trainers Patrick Clowry, Jeffrey McGee and Eugene Fleming and </p><p>U.S. Customs trainer Carolyn Okafor for their professionalism </p><p>strong commitment and collegial attitude, and hopes that they </p><p>can return for the second iteration of the course in Lagos in </p><p>December or January. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
