<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 000541 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DRL/IRF, DRL, EAP/BCLTV </p><p>PASS TO US COMMISSION FOR INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, PINS, VM, HUMANR, ETMIN, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: DECEMBER 2002 GASSING INCIDENT IN LAI CHAU </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Reports of a gas attack on Hmong </p><p>Protestants in Lai Chau province on December 29, 2002 appear </p><p>to have a basis in fact.  However, the gas appears to have </p><p>been something like pepper spray or tear gas rather than more </p><p>lethal poison gas as claimed in some reports.  There are no </p><p>confirmed deaths as a result of this attack.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Two Protestant evangelists have shared with </p><p>Embassy reports they have gathered from various sources </p><p>regarding a single gassing incident that took place on </p><p>December 29, 2002 in Hoi Huong hamlet of Dien Bien district </p><p>of Lai Chau.  It appears that 23 local officials, primarily </p><p>police, came to the building where the Hmong had gathered to </p><p>worship.  One source said that when the authorities tried to </p><p>confiscate the worshipers\' Bibles and songbooks, the women </p><p>and children in the congregation left (apparently with some </p><p>of the Bibles and songbooks), leaving 90 men.  The </p><p>authorities then withdrew an unknown distance.  Then there </p><p>were two "explosions," immediately followed by some unknown </p><p>hot gas, which caused burning sensations in the mouth, nose, </p><p>and eyes, as well as difficulty breathing. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  According to one source, four men were </p><p>hospitalized as a result of the gas, but all were out of the </p><p>hospital by some time before February 19.  Accounts differ on </p><p>whether the victims included women.  One source has claimed </p><p>one woman miscarried after the attack. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  When asked on January 29 about reports of a gas </p><p>attack, the Lai Chau provincial People\'s Committee\'s Chief of </p><p>Chancery confirmed, "co su viec" ("there was something") but </p><p>stressed that what actually happened was "completely </p><p>different" from international reports.  However, he refused </p><p>to elaborate or to answer any more questions and referred </p><p>inquiries to the province\'s International Cooperation </p><p>Department (ICD).  Subsequent attempts to telephone the ICD </p><p>and the hospital where some gassing victims were reportedly </p><p>taken have been unsuccessful. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  After two Hmong eyewitnesses recounted the episode </p><p>to the Evangelical Church of Vietnam (North), church </p><p>officials in Hanoi arranged for a meeting with the Ministry </p><p>of Public Security, which reportedly promised to investigate </p><p>the incident.  However, as of February 26, there had been no </p><p>response. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  The two sources separately provided Embassy copies </p><p>of a report apparently written by Hoi Huong residents within </p><p>about two hours of the gassing.  They allegedly compelled </p><p>three local officials involved in the incident to sign as </p><p>witnesses.  The following is Embassy\'s informal translation. </p><p> </p><p>Quote: </p><p>Socialist Republic of Vietnam </p><p>Independence - Freedom - Happiness </p><p> </p><p>A Report by Witnesses </p><p> </p><p>Today, 29 December 2002 at about 9:00 AM, we citizens of Hoi </p><p>Huong hamlet, Muong Nha commune, Dien Bien District, Lai Chau </p><p>province, went to the house of Vu Say So to pray and worship. </p><p> The reason is because we are Protestant Christians belonging </p><p>to the Evangelical Church of Vietnam based at 2 Ngo Tram </p><p>Street in Hanoi.  At that time, a whole team of officials of </p><p>Dien Bien District Lai Chau, implementing Plan 184, came into </p><p>the house.  There were 23 people in this Plan 184 working </p><p>delegation.  At the same time we were about to start our </p><p>worship service, someone released a hot gas into the house. </p><p>It had a hot smell and it penetrated our mouths, noses, and </p><p>eyes, and it made us all collapse. </p><p> </p><p>Also at that time, three cadres came down the road from Dien </p><p>Bien or Da Dong.  Six people who saw them were Vu A Tu, Sung </p><p>A Vu, Vu A Lan, Vu Pha Sang, Vu Thi Lu, and Vu Sua Se.  These </p><p>six people heard the explosion set off by the three cadres, </p><p>who then helped each other out of the building covering their </p><p>faces and noses, laughing.  They were Vu Da Chu (illegible) </p><p>of Dien Bien district, Tra A Pao of Dien Bien district </p><p>police, and Lo Van Tien, Dien Bien district Youth Union </p><p>official.   They were seen laughing, Pao covering his mouth, </p><p>Tien holding his head high.  Meanwhile other cadres were </p><p>outside or in the house next door. </p><p> </p><p>At this time Mr. Vu Sung So, who was outside, saw three </p><p>cadres leave the house and run away. </p><p> </p><p>Those who were strongly affected by the gas include:  Giang </p><p>Thi My, Mua A Khoi, Sung Thi Do, Vu Thi Senh, Lau Thi Chu, </p><p>Lau Thi Mua, Vang Thi Do, Vu Thi Lia, and Mua Thi My.  There </p><p>were other people affected as well. </p><p> </p><p>The people named became very sick and were taken to the Ban </p><p>Khoan Hospital (in) Muong Nha commune. </p><p>If after this something bad happens, injury or death, then </p><p>the 184 working delegation (or unit) must bear responsibility </p><p>for the people sickened by the hot gas, and must compensate </p><p>them. </p><p> </p><p>We wrote this report before 11:15 a.m. the same day. </p><p> </p><p>Report prepared by Lau Phai Senh (signature) </p><p> </p><p>Representative of the village Vu A Cong (signature) </p><p> </p><p>Witnesses (signatures) </p><p>Vu Thi Lu </p><p>Vu A Lau </p><p>Sung A Vu </p><p>Vu A Da (or Dia) </p><p>Vu A Tu </p><p> </p><p>Affirmed by village chairman Vu Nha Ca (signature) </p><p> </p><p>Working group (or unit) 184 (signatures) </p><p>Vu A Chu </p><p>Chang A Pao </p><p>Lu Van Tien </p><p> </p><p>End quote. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Comment.  This incident underscores the mix of </p><p>rumor and fact that complicate balanced reporting on </p><p>religious freedom and practice in remote parts of Vietnam. </p><p>What may have been GVN crowd control techniques to break up </p><p>what appeared to local officials an illegal gathering under </p><p>Vietnam\'s strict regulations on assembly led to </p><p>unsubstantiated and apparently untrue international reports </p><p>of poison gas and Christian martyrs.  One of the most </p><p>important factors preventing a more accurate picture of what </p><p>really happened is the GVN\'s own self-defeating lack of </p><p>transparency. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
