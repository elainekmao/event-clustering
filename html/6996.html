Humanitarian assistance is beginning to flow into parts </p><p>of southern Iraq provided by both the Kuwaiti Red Crescent </p><p>and Coalition forces.  An UNSECOORD security assessment team </p><p>is expected to travel to Umm Qasr on 30 March to determine </p><p>whether the town can be deemed a permissive environment for </p><p>future U.N. humanitarian operations.

End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>HUMANITARIAN OPERATION CENTER (HOC) DAILY BREIFING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>2.  According to the Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC), </p><p>Coalition forces have reported an area of low, mud-hut </p><p>dwellings on the outskirts of Al Nasiriyah populated by an </p><p>unknown number of people in need of food and water.  In </p><p>response, Coalition forces plan to supply 20,000 </p><p>humanitarian daily rations and 24,000 liters of bottled </p><p>water to the population. </p><p> </p><p>3.  On 28 March, the Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society sent a </p><p>nine-truck convoy to Safwan.   Five trucks are carrying </p><p>daily rations and four trucks are transporting monthly </p><p>family rations.  The Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society has not </p><p>discussed operational plans with the HOC.  The Kuwaiti Red </p><p>Crescent Society also conducted a survey on 28 March to </p><p>determine the site for a field hospital within the UNIKOM </p><p>compound. </p><p> </p><p>4.  A UNICEF-sponsored three-truck convoy was expected to </p><p>leave on 29 March for Umm Qasr.  The convoy is transporting </p><p>water, water bladders, and health kits.  No UNICEF staff is </p><p>part of the convoy and funding is coming from private </p><p>sources using local drivers.   The International Committee </p><p>of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Children\'s </p><p>Fund (UNICEF) have agreed to send a convoy to Basra on 29 </p><p>March.   Several trucks will be carrying water and one ICRC </p><p>medical kit to the hospital.  ICRC is expected to be in </p><p>charge of the distribution. </p><p> </p><p>5.  An UNSECOORD security assessment team is expected to </p><p>travel to Umm Qasr on 30 March to determine whether the town </p><p>can be deemed a permissive environment for future U.N. </p><p>humanitarian operations. </p><p> </p><p>6.  UNICEF-sponsored water tanker deliveries were made to </p><p>Umm Qasr, Safwan, and Az Zubayr on 28 March.  In addition, </p><p>the convoys transported a number of 5,000 cubic meter water </p><p>bladders to the three locations.  The water bladders are </p><p>being pre-positioned to provide a continuous supply of water </p><p>to these vulnerable populations.  On 29 March, a water </p><p>delivery is being made to the town of Umm Qhayal, northwest </p><p>of Umm Qasr with a population of 30,000. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The three-kilometer pipeline being constructed from </p><p>Kuwait towards Umm Qasr is expected to be completed on 30 </p><p>March.  This new source of water will provide 2.4 million </p><p>liters of water per day to southern Iraq.  Water tankers </p><p>currently trucking water from inside Kuwait will be able to </p><p>use the new source to provide water to areas including Umm </p><p>Qasr, Safwan, Basra, Umm Qhayal, and Az Zubayr. </p><p> </p><p>8.  A U.S. military spokesman estimated that between 1,000 </p><p>and 2,000 residents fled the ongoing conflict in Basra on 28 </p><p>March.  There was no indication as to the current location </p><p>of the displaced, but they are reported to be in the local </p><p>area.  No information was provided on injuries or casualties </p><p>or whether they were forced to flee or voluntarily departed. </p><p>The spokesperson also reported that residents of Basra are </p><p>receiving approximately 100 liters of water per day instead </p><p>of the usual daily 300 to 350 liters per day.  The DART will </p><p>attempt to confirm daily water delivery levels with UNICEF </p><p>and/or ICRC representatives. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Sixty percent of the southern Iraqi oilfields are under </p><p>Coalition control.  Three oil wells remain to be </p><p>extinguished. </p><p> </p><p>10.  The daily HOC briefing is available on the Humanitarian </p><p>Information Center\'s website at www.agoodplacetostart.org </p><p>under the tabs Coordination Structures, Regions, Kuwait. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>USAID - RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  On 27 March, the ORHA / USAID Reconstruction Team </p><p>leaders met with representatives of CENTCOM and CFLCC to </p><p>prepare an integrated operations plan.  Functional groups </p><p>from all three entities prepared and presented concept </p><p>papers outlining their respective operations plans, </p><p>including assets available for implementation. </p><p>Additionally, the groups sought to identify operational gaps </p><p>and potential remedies.  Overall, USAID responses were well </p><p>received by the military and revealed no serious issues at </p><p>this point.  It was emphasized that the greatest impediment </p><p>to implementation remains the physical security situation in </p><p>Iraq, and until that changes for the better, plans will </p><p>remain on hold. </p><p> </p><p>12.  On 28 March, Ambassador Bodine chaired a daylong </p><p>planning session, which included representatives from all </p><p>relevant U.S. agencies and groups that will be on the ground </p><p>in the Central Region.  Most of the ORHA / USAID </p><p>Reconstruction Team leaders participated in the sessions, </p><p>aimed at identifying sectoral issues in water/sanitation, </p><p>health, transportation, municipal services, and other </p><p>management. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Upon reviewing the terms of the airport reconstruction </p><p>and operations contract, the military has advised that they </p><p>will not support any airport not under their control. </p><p>Therefore, the existing airport contracts may need to be </p><p>examined to assure inclusion of tower and approach </p><p>capabilities at all airports, including radar equipment and </p><p>maintenance, as well as FAA liaison. </p><p> </p><p>14.  By way of clarification, the USAID Mission did not </p><p>report any intention to implement plans to provide, on an </p><p>exceptional basis, 900,000 liters of bottled water to the </p><p>Iraqi population; rather the USAID Mission evaluated </p><p>available quick-response capabilities for providing drinking </p><p>water.  Such responses, under the Logcap logistics contract, </p><p>have been deemed doable, but there are no current plans to </p><p>activate them barring a clear need, assessment, and </p><p>coordination with the DART and others. </p><p> </p><p>15.  The USAID Mission plans to begin reporting a once- </p><p>weekly update on security beginning on 28 March in view of </p><p>the fact that the security environment may impact operations </p><p>from time to time. </p><p> </p><p>16.  The Port of Umm Qasr is still not considered permissive </p><p>for the entrance of USAID\'s Port Reconstruction Manager. </p><p>(EMBASSY NOTE:  The port was declared "permissive" on March </p><p>31.  END NOTE.) The Mission has investigated the operational </p><p>and logistic requirements for the manager\'s entrance. </p><p>Security and logistics arrangements have been made to assure </p><p>his arrival there as soon as the situation is deemed </p><p>permissive. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
