(U) Classified by Charge Richard A. Albright for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  This is an action message -- please see </p><p>paragraph five. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) At the initiative of MFA Minstate Shaykh </p><p>Hamdan bin Zayied, the UAE is sending a nine-member </p><p>delegation to Washington during the week of May 19 to </p><p>discuss Iraq reconstruction.  Growing out of the UAE\'s </p><p>participation in the informal consulting group on Iraq </p><p>reconstruction, the goal of the visit is to showcase </p><p>the capabilities of the UAE to assist in </p><p>rehabilitating certain key sectors in Iraq, and to </p><p>make initial contacts face to face with U.S. </p><p>policymakers involved in helping map out the </p><p>reconstruction agenda.  Timed to coincide with the </p><p>visit of UAE Chief of Staff LtgTG Shaykh Mughammad bin </p><p>Zayid, the reconstruction team will hew to a separate </p><p>schedule.  Participants will be: </p><p> </p><p>A.  Sultan bin Sulayem, Executive Chairman of the </p><p>Dubai Ports, Customs and Free Zones Authority; </p><p> </p><p>B.  Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuaimi, MFA Assistant </p><p>Undersecretary/Usec for pPolitical aAffairs; </p><p> </p><p>C.  Saeed Saif Al-Suweidi, Chairman of the UAE </p><p>Federation of Chambers of Commerce; </p><p> </p><p>D.  Muhammad Omran, Deputy CEO at UAE telecoms </p><p>monopoly Etisalat and also Chairman of the Board of </p><p>Directors of satellite telephone firm Thuraya; </p><p> </p><p>E.  Obeid Al-Tayer, Chairmanhead of the Dubai Chamber </p><p>of Commerce; </p><p> </p><p>F.  Finance A/Usec Khalid Al-Bustani, Assistant </p><p>Undersecretary, Ministry of Finance; </p><p> </p><p>G.  Saeek Al-Hamiz, Central Bank Executive Director </p><p>for Banking Supervision at the Central BankSaeed Al- </p><p>Hamiz; </p><p> </p><p>H.  Rashid Al-Suweidi, MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid\'s </p><p>representative on the UAE\'s interagency Iraq </p><p>reconstruction committee; and, </p><p> </p><p>I.  Ali Mubarak,  Director, Department of Origins, </p><p>Ministry if Commerce (largely involved in textile </p><p>quota issues). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Charge met with MFA A/USEC Abdullah Rashid </p><p>Al-Nuaimi May 12 to discuss the visit.  The UAE </p><p>official said that his government wishes to establish </p><p>direct contact with key USG decision-makers on Iraq </p><p>reconstruction and to showcase the significant </p><p>capabilities of the UAE, particularly in the fields of </p><p>shipping/customs pre-clearance, financial services, </p><p>and telecommunications.  Al-Nuaimi acknowledged that </p><p>these would largely be introductory meetings, but he </p><p>stressed that the UAEG considers it important now to </p><p>"open that first door."  Charge outlined possible </p><p>interlocutors, including the key USG participants in </p><p>the weekly Iraq reconstruction conference calls; the </p><p>MFA official said this would be an excellent place to </p><p>start. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  Comment and Action Request:  This visit has </p><p>high-level support here and while we have been careful </p><p>to seek to manage expectations (by, for example, </p><p>dissuading the Emiratis from having the Minister of </p><p>Economy and Commerce head the delegation, instead </p><p>emphasizing that this would be a series of </p><p>introductory calls on the key USG officials guiding </p><p>the Iraq reconstruction effort).  Nonetheless,, it is </p><p>clear that the UAEG sees this trip as a means to lay </p><p>out their capabilities and stake a claim to a piece of </p><p>the Iraq reconstruction pie.  Given the sensitivities </p><p>involved, post would very much appreciate the </p><p>Department\'s assistance in organizing a comprehensive </p><p>schedule for this short-notice, but significantmajor </p><p>Emirati delegation.  Activities beyond meetings with </p><p>conference call principals at DoD, Treasury and State </p><p>could include an activity with BCIU or the Arab-U.S. </p><p>Chamber, meeting with senior the USAID officials </p><p>Director, as well as possible side-bars for select </p><p>delegation members on Strategic Dialogue issues (such </p><p>as OPIC coverage for the UAE and ARBIFT).  We also </p><p>pulsed Abdullah Rashid on his availability for </p><p>meetings in the Department on broader Strategic </p><p>Dialogue issues (ICC Article 98, Trafficking in </p><p>Persons, etc.) and he said he would welcome this, but </p><p>that his primary focus would be to accompany the group </p><p>on Iraq reconstruction meetings. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  This message coordinated with Amconsul Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
