<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000674 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS ON APRIL 12 </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The April 12 National Assembly </p><p>elections will demonstrate if the Independent National </p><p>Electoral Commission (INEC) was right when it said it </p><p>was ready to hold these and the April 19 gubernatorial </p><p>and presidential polls.  In addition to being a </p><p>logistical "dry run" for the April 19 polls, the </p><p>National Assembly elections will indicate the </p><p>prevailing political mood.  We believe the ruling </p><p>People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) will lose some seats. </p><p>Increased competition resulting from the entry of new </p><p>political parties and unbridled aisle-crossing by </p><p>incumbents who lost primaries will diminish today\'s </p><p>substantial PDP majority.  However, if the PDP loses </p><p>too many seats, "bandwagon effect" for the opposition </p><p>could develop, spelling trouble for President Obasanjo </p><p>the following week.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>PDP Majority Likely To Diminish </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The ruling People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) </p><p>originally had a majority of 73 seats out of 109 (67 </p><p>percent) in the Senate and 216 seats out of 359 (60 </p><p>percent) in the House.  However, there will be many </p><p>new faces in the next National Assembly.  The current </p><p>National Assembly did not distinguish itself as a law- </p><p>making body.  Most Nigerians saw it as venal, </p><p>indifferent, and ineffective.  Some legislators from </p><p>all three parties in the National Assembly (PDP, ANPP </p><p>and AD) declined to seek party renomination because of </p><p>their unpopularity, others found their renominations </p><p>stymied by antagonistic governors.  Within the PDP, </p><p>the Presidency and PDP National Executive teamed to </p><p>foil the reelection ambitions of many other National </p><p>Assembly incumbents who had supported the impeachment </p><p>threat against President Obasanjo or had managed </p><p>through other means to get on the President\'s bad </p><p>side.  Only 30 percent of PDP incumbents were </p><p>renominated by the PDP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Citizens Frustrated </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Given the PDP\'s sizeable numerical advantage </p><p>some "leveling" was expected, under even the best </p><p>circumstances.  However, current political and </p><p>economic conditions have citizens seething.  Lengthy </p><p>queues for petrol have become a symbol of a general malaise </p><p>of ills.  Almost any incumbent would be nervous under </p><p>these emergent conditions, but the PDP will bear the </p><p>brunt of the electoral disaffection over a stagnant </p><p>economy, deteriorating public infrastructure (schools, </p><p>roads, hospitals, utilities), endemic corruption, </p><p>widespread communal violence and the failure of all </p><p>levels of government to meet their financial </p><p>obligations.  After all, the ruling party has </p><p>controlled the Presidency, 21 of 36 governorships and </p><p>both Houses of the National Assembly for nearly four </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>More Competition </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Moreover, competition has been more intense </p><p>than in 1999.  The fact that the number of parties has </p><p>increased from 3 to 30 since the last election means </p><p>the PDP will likely have a reduced share of the pie </p><p>this time around.  Credible candidates who were </p><p>reluctant to run in 1999 (perhaps because they feared </p><p>the Fourth Republic would quickly vanish) have changed </p><p>their minds.  Many of these candidates are running </p><p>under the banner of opposition parties.  Some of the </p><p>new parties, such as the Igbo-dominated All People\'s </p><p>Grand Alliance (APGA), would have trouble winning the </p><p>Presidency but can field popular candidates in some </p><p>races on their home turf.  These smaller parties can </p><p>give both the PDP and the main opposition All Nigerian </p><p>People\'s Party (ANPP) a real run for popular votes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Opposition from Governors and the Presidency </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Another factor is that the advantages of </p><p>incumbency are much weaker for National Assembly </p><p>members than Governors or the President.  Again, </p><p>because the PDP has such a large majority, it must </p><p>defend more seats.  Finally, popular PDP incumbents </p><p>who ran afoul of their governors or the Presidency </p><p>typically found themselves denied renomination. </p><p>Governors used their control of the PDP apparatus in </p><p>their states to defeat political opponents during </p><p>party caucuses late last year.  The Presidency more </p><p>than once weighed in with governors and other state- </p><p>level officials to stymie its opponents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Three of the four senior officers of the </p><p>National Assembly might not return.  Having lost a </p><p>battle for control of the Ebonyi PDP to Governor Sam </p><p>Egwu and having failed in his effort to impeach </p><p>Obasanjo for his support of Egwu, Senate President </p><p>Anyim decided not to seek re-election.  Speaker of the </p><p>House Ghali Umar Na\'Abba was able to secure </p><p>renomination despite Governor Kwankwaso\'s and </p><p>Obasanjo\'s opposition because of overwhelming popular </p><p>support for Na\'Abba in his Kano constituency. </p><p>However, the Kano PDP recently expelled Na\'Abba for </p><p>"anti-party" activity, an action that would have </p><p>forfeited the seat.  Sensing trouble, the national PDP </p><p>decided to "suspend" Na\'Abba, so his post-election </p><p>fate is far from clear, even if he wins his </p><p>constituency.  Deputy House Speaker Prince Chibudom </p><p>Nwuche\'s primary challenge failed to unseat Rivers </p><p>Governor Peter Odili, a strong Obasanjo ally.  Among </p><p>the top four National Assembly officers, only Deputy </p><p>Senate President Ibrahim Mantu (another Obasanjo ally) </p><p>seems certain to return. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Crossing the Aisle </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Popular politicians cast aside by the PDP </p><p>often joined another party.  Nwuche pitched his tent </p><p>with the ANPP, as did former Senate President </p><p>Okadigbo.  Nwuche continues to run for the Rivers </p><p>governorship and Okadigbo is now Buhari\'s running mate </p><p>on the ANPP Presidential ticket.  Other PDP National </p><p>Assembly members are seeking to return on the ticket </p><p>of another party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) INEC plans to formally announce the results of </p><p>the National Assembly elections on April 17, two days </p><p>prior to the presidential contest.  Informal but </p><p>accurate results may be known before then.  The timing </p><p>of the results\' announcement is extremely important. </p><p>If the results are actually announced prior to April </p><p>19, the legislative elections may take on aspects akin </p><p>to a "vote of confidence" or a referendum on the </p><p>President.  The PDP is expected to lose seats. </p><p>However, losing too many seats, particularly in areas </p><p>where the PDP was assumed to be strong, will be </p><p>perceived as a shift in electoral momentum heading </p><p>into the Presidential campaign.  It will be taken as </p><p>evidence that Obasanjo\'s strength is waning and could </p><p>produce a "bandwagon effect" away from the PDP.  The </p><p>principal beneficiary of this phenomenon would be ANPP </p><p>Presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
