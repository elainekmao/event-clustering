Ashley Wills: </p><p>REASONS:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Another in Sri Lanka\'s long series of </p><p>cohabitation crises has erupted as President Kumaratunga </p><p>has taken steps to take over the lucrative national </p><p>lottery board.  The GSL has resisted the move fiercely </p><p>and the dispute seems bound for the courts.  In the </p><p>meantime, the GSL is mulling over trying to impeach the </p><p>president or calling new elections.  It is not clear how </p><p>far both sides want to press this matter, but </p><p>cohabitation ties, which were bad, continue their </p><p>downhill slide.  Suggested "if asked" press guidance is </p><p>contained in Para 10.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>President Acts to Take Over Key Agency </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In the latest crisis involving Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>always tense cohabitation ties, President Kumaratunga </p><p>took steps May 9 to take over control of the Development </p><p>Lotteries Board from the government.  (Note:  The funds </p><p>this agency makes, and it is believed to run a large </p><p>profit, are supposed to be used for national development </p><p>projects.  Some of the money is also provided to the </p><p>"President\'s Fund," which is controlled by Kumaratunga </p><p>and was set up to make similar development-related </p><p>allotments.  Many observers consider the agency to be a </p><p>source of slush funds for those in government.  End </p><p>Note.)  The details are a bit sketchy, but the president </p><p>apparently signed an executive order late </p><p>May 9 taking over the board.  Copies of this order and a </p><p>letter signed by the president were duly sent to Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe and Minister of Economic Reform </p><p>Milinda Moragoda, who is chairman of the lotteries </p><p>board.  In her letter, the president explained her move, </p><p>asserting that she had to act because of reports she had </p><p>received of managerial malfeasance at the board (She did </p><p>not accuse Moragoda of any personal wrongdoing, </p><p>however).  She also argued that the agency should have </p><p>been transferred to presidential control at the time the </p><p>government switched hands in December 2001, and not been </p><p>put under the Prime Minister to begin with.  (Note:  We </p><p>also understand that the President was worried about </p><p>tentative plans to privatize the lotteries board, which </p><p>would deprive her of money for her "Presidents Fund.") </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>GSL Disputes Move </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Bitterly opposed to the president\'s action, the </p><p>GSL acted immediately to prevent the order from being </p><p>published in the government gazette.  (Note:  In Sri </p><p>Lanka, executive orders seem to need to be published in </p><p>the gazette in order to take effect, although the </p><p>president\'s office and her supporters are disputing this </p><p>-- see below.)  To do this, the government ordered </p><p>police and party supporters to go to the government\'s </p><p>main printing office in downtown Colombo late May 9 to </p><p>prevent publication of the order.  Amid what turned out </p><p>to be almost a mini-riot, the GSL made sure the order </p><p>was not printed.  Instead, the chief printer conveyed </p><p>the issue to the Attorney General, who is now looking </p><p>into the matter.  (Note:  As of May 12, the police are </p><p>still closing off roads in the vicinity of the </p><p>government\'s printing office in an effort to prevent </p><p>trouble.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) In arguing against her action, the prime </p><p>minister and Moragoda both immediately sent letters </p><p>(which were made public) to the president asserting that </p><p>the action she had taken was improper.  The PM\'s letter, </p><p>more legal in nature than Moragoda\'s, asserted that Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s constitution requires that the president </p><p>"consult" with the PM prior to taking moves involving </p><p>the government.  Moragoda\'s letter, meanwhile, asserted </p><p>that what the president had done cut completely against </p><p>the grain of the need for the president and the </p><p>government to work together to smooth out cohabitation </p><p>problems. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>GSL Contacts U.S. </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Per Ref A, the president\'s action also </p><p>precipitated a flood of requests by GSL personages for </p><p>U.S. help.  On May 9-10, the Ambassador received several </p><p>calls from Moragoda and one from the PM, for example, </p><p>requesting that the U.S. do what it could to stop what </p><p>they characterized as the president\'s "meddling" in the </p><p>government\'s business.  In response, the Ambassador </p><p>noted that the U.S. generally does not get involved in </p><p>specific issues involving Sri Lanka\'s internal political </p><p>and legal system.  He went on to underscore, however, </p><p>our long-standing position that the government and the </p><p>president need to work together in the national interest </p><p>in order to move the peace process and economic reform </p><p>forward. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In the course of discussions on this issue, </p><p>Moragoda told the Ambassador that he would quit all his </p><p>jobs in the government, including his position as a key </p><p>member of the GSL\'s peace negotiation team, if the </p><p>president\'s decision was put into effect.  The </p><p>Ambassador, noting Moragoda\'s importance to the </p><p>government and to the peace process, urged him not to </p><p>take such a drastic action. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Next Steps in Crisis </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) At this point, the government appears to remain </p><p>in charge of the lotteries board with Moragoda still </p><p>acting as chairman.  In the meantime, Attorney General </p><p>K.C. Kamalasabayson, who is considered a relatively </p><p>neutral figure, is reviewing the matter.  It seems that </p><p>he will either issue an advisory opinion on the issue or </p><p>directly refer it to the court system.  As noted above, </p><p>the GSL is arguing hard that the president had no right </p><p>to act without consulting the PM first.  The president </p><p>and her supporters, on the other hand, are arguing that </p><p>printing in the gazette is a mere technicality and the </p><p>order should be ruled as being in effect. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) As the legal angles play out, the situation has </p><p>charged up those in the governing United National Party </p><p>(UNP) who believe that the party should move against the </p><p>president in a political sense.  Moragoda has told the </p><p>Ambassador, for example, that there are some in UNP </p><p>circles who are talking of moving forward with long- </p><p>standing abuse of power charges against Kumaratunga with </p><p>the aim of impeaching her.  Others in the party are </p><p>thinking of calling new elections, which many in the UNP </p><p>believe will result in gains vis-a-vis the president\'s </p><p>People\'s Alliance (PA) party.  There is also talk of </p><p>seriously constraining her "power of the purse" by </p><p>starving her office of funding.  As of mid-day May 12, </p><p>it is not clear whether the prime minister has decided </p><p>to take any of these courses or under what conditions he </p><p>may do so.  In the meantime, others in the party are </p><p>counseling patience and a return to the status quo ante, </p><p>urging that the government work to convince the </p><p>president to rescind her order re the lottery. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) It is not clear how far both sides want to press </p><p>this matter.  Our sense, at this point, is that the </p><p>president and the GSL might back off and not choose to </p><p>make this matter a cause belli.  That said, after </p><p>periodic crises over the course of past months, it is </p><p>clear that cohabitation ties, which were bad, are </p><p>continuing their downhill slide.  This is very bad news </p><p>for the peace process, which is also in a trough because </p><p>of the Tamil Tigers\' recent decision to suspend their </p><p>participation in the peace talks.  Clearly, if the GSL </p><p>is engaged in fighting with the president, it will not </p><p>be able to give the process the full attention it </p><p>requires, especially during this sensitive timeframe. </p><p>(Note:  SA A/S Rocca is currently visiting Sri Lanka. </p><p>Her meetings, including comments in reference to co- </p><p>habitation, will be reported Septel.)  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Suggested Press Guidance </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Suggested "if asked" press guidance follows: </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p>Question: </p><p> </p><p>What is the U.S. position regarding the public fight </p><p>which has broken out between the president and the prime </p><p>minister in Sri Lanka over the control of a key agency? </p><p> </p><p>Answer: </p><p> </p><p>We are aware of the situation in Sri Lanka.  We continue </p><p>to urge all sides to work together in a cooperative and </p><p>conciliatory manner.  The focus must remain on the </p><p>national interest in moving the peace process and </p><p>economic reform forward. </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
