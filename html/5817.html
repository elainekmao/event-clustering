SUMMARY:  DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO IRAQ CONTINUED TO GENERATE </p><p>EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN THE UAE\'S MEDIA.  EDITORIALS LAUDED THE </p><p>FRENCH AND GERMAN POSITIONS AND URGED THE ARABS TO SUPPORT THESE </p><p>POSITIONS IN FACE OF U.S. DETERMINATION FOR A WAR AGAINST IRAQ. </p><p>THE EDITORIALS CRITICIZED ARABS\' FAILURE TO AGREE ON AN EMERGENCY </p><p>ARAB SUMMIT AT THIS CRUCIAL TIME.  HOWEVER, MANY COLUMNISTS </p><p>BELIEVE THAT A WAR AGAINST IRAQ WILL BE LAUNCHED WHETHER IRAQ </p><p>COOPERATES WITH THE UN INSPECTORS OR NOT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SHARJAH-BASED ARABIC PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED ON 2/18: </p><p> </p><p>"THE HUGE DEMONSTRATIONS THE WORLD WITNESSED LAST SATURDAY </p><p>REJECTING AN AMERICAN (LED) WAR AGAINST IRAQ HAVE RESTORED THE </p><p>HUMAN FACE OF OUR WORLD ... ALTHOUGH BRITISH OFFICIALS ARE AFRAID </p><p>OF THE MOVEMENTS IN THE STREET, WHICH SUPPORT JACK STRAW\'S </p><p>REMARKS THAT BRITAIN CANNOT TAKE PART IN A WAR WITHOUT POPULAR </p><p>SUPPORT, THOSE WHO BLOW THE TRUMPETS OF WAR ARE PERSISTENT, </p><p>WHETHER IN LONDON OR WASHINGTON.  WASHINGTON WILL NOT BE CONFINED </p><p>UNLESS IT SNATCHES A NEW RESOLUTION FROM THE UN TO MAINTAIN A </p><p>COVER FOR ITS AGGRESSION... UNLESS THE FRENCH, GERMAN, RUSSIAN </p><p>AND CHINESE POSITIONS ARE BACKED WITH A STRONGER AND PRACTICAL </p><p>ARAB STANCE, THE AMERICAN-BRITISH DECEPTION IS EXPECTED TO </p><p>SUCCEED.  AFTER ALL, NO ONE IN THE WORLD WILL BE MORE INTERESTED </p><p>IN ARAB INTERESTS THAN THE ARABS THEMSELVES." </p><p> </p><p>3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "AN ARAB EMERGENCY SUMMIT IS A MUST," ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL-ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON </p><p>2/18: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE ARAB FOREIGN MINISTERS\' FAILURE TO DECIDE A DATE FOR AN </p><p>EMERGENCY SUMMIT IS A REFLECTION AND AN EXTENSION OF THE ARABS\' </p><p>SITUATION, WHICH COULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ELIMINATE IN 10 </p><p>YEARS.  NEVERTHELESS, EFFORTS SHOULD CONTINUE TO CONVENE SUCH A </p><p>SUMMIT SO THAT THE ARABS DISCUSS THE EXCEPTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>FACING THEM.  WE BELIEVE A WAR AGAINST IRAQ IS A GRAVE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD DEEPLY SHAKE THE ENTIRE ARAB FOUNDATION." </p><p> </p><p>4.  COMMENTING ON REMARKS MADE BY BRITISH PREMIER TONY BLAIR ON A </p><p>LEGAL COVER FOR THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL TO DECIDE FOR WAR, ABU </p><p>DHABI-BASED SEMI-OFFICIAL ARABIC DAILY "AL-ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED </p><p>ON 2/18: </p><p> </p><p>"... IT SEEMS THAT THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DOES NOT KNOW THAT </p><p>THE UN AUTHORITY AND THE INTERNATIONAL LEGALITY FROM WHICH HE </p><p>SEEKS ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN HUMILIATED AND DESPISED BY A RACIST AND </p><p>TERRORIST ENTITY ... BRITAIN PLANTED ITS SEEDS IN THE REGION AND </p><p>AGAINST WHICH DOZENS OF RESOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN ISSUED, NONE OF </p><p>THEM WAS IMPLEMENTED..." </p><p> </p><p>5.  DR. AISHA AL-MARRI WROTE IN HER COLUMN IN "AL-ITTIHAD" ON </p><p>2/19: </p><p> </p><p>"THE INTENDED WAR AGAINST IRAQ IS A DARK COMEDY AND A MAZE WHERE </p><p>ALL ROADS WILL LEAD TO THE \'OPTION\' OF WAR.  IF IRAQ COOPERATES </p><p>WITH THE INSPECTORS AND REVEALS NEW INFORMATION REGARDING HIS </p><p>ARSENAL, IT IMPLIES THAT HE HAS BEEN HIDING THEM FOR A LONG TIME, </p><p>WHICH SUPPORTS U.S. CLAIMS AND BOOSTS THE OPTION FOR WAR.  BUT, </p><p>IF IRAQ DOES NOT REVEAL ANY NEW INFORMATION, IT MEANS THAT IT </p><p>STILL SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED... THIS MAZE CAN ONLY LEAD TO </p><p>THE OPTION OF WAR..." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
