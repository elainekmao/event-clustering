<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ISTANBUL 000162 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p>USDOC FOR 3133/USFCS/010/EUR AND 4212/MAC/OEURA/DEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY ALPHABET SOUP: ISTANBUL\'S MYRIAD BUSINESS </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Istanbul, Turkey\'s economic, commercial </p><p>and cultural capital, hosts a rich diversity of business </p><p>voices, all seeking to influence both government policy and </p><p>international perceptions of Turkey.  Leader of the pack is </p><p>the venerable TUSIAD-- Turkish Industrialists and </p><p>Businessmen\'s Association-- now in its fourth decade, which </p><p>has won widespread respect (and occasional government pique) </p><p>for its cogent policy critiques.  In recent years, a host of </p><p>other organizations has emerged.  Tellingly, for a country </p><p>and society still grappling with the proper boundaries of </p><p>religion and a secular order, many of them are more avowedly </p><p>religious.  Young business leaders have also stepped forward, </p><p>establishing groups to encourage entrepreneurship and to </p><p>enable them to step out from their elders\' shadow.  End </p><p>Sumary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Running the gamut: Business associations in Istanbul </p><p>come in a wide variety, beginning with those quasi-public </p><p>organizations used to organize the business sector, </p><p>continuing on to mixed organizations which seek to advance </p><p>such national goals as international trade and exports, to </p><p>the purely private and voluntary organizations that now crowd </p><p>the city scene.  Numerically, quasi-public organizations, and </p><p>particularly the local Chambers of Commerce and Industry, </p><p>still hold pride of place.  But given that membership is </p><p>compulsory (in that it is necessary for registration as a new </p><p>business entity), they have tended to have less of a lobbying </p><p>role.  Only in recent years has the umbrella (and </p><p>Ankara-based) Union of Chambers of Commerce (TOBB) begun to </p><p>make its voice heard.  Similarly, mixed organizations (such </p><p>as the Foreign Economic Relations Board and its affiliated </p><p>business councils) have focused on specific policy goals and </p><p>remained relatively uncontroversial.  Not so the private </p><p>organizations.  As exemplified by TUSIAD\'s recent </p><p>confrontation with the Gul government over both Iraq policy </p><p>and pursuit of economic reform, they have waded into the </p><p>thick of policy debates, and played an important role in </p><p>national politics.  Their importance is not new (some ascribe </p><p>the fall of one of Bulent Ecevit\'s early governments in the </p><p>late 1970s to TUSIAD\'s opposition).  But in an environment </p><p>where many perceive a lack of (or lackluster) political </p><p>opposition, they have assumed increasing importance.  "The </p><p>markets are the government\'s opposition," one leading </p><p>investment analyst told us recently, and by extension these </p><p>organizations play a similar role.  Inspired by TUSIAD\'s </p><p>success, the range of organizations has widened dramatically </p><p>in the last decade, and now encompasses "young" business </p><p>leaders, "independent" business leaders, and more avowedly </p><p>"religious" business leaders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The Heavyweight-- TUSIAD: If it has spawned a slew </p><p>of imitators, until TOBB recently began to take a more active </p><p>role, TUSIAD has had no serious challenger for the title of </p><p>Turkey\'s most influential business association.  Founded in </p><p>1971, its 471 members represent over 1300 of Turkey\'s largest </p><p>companies, producing 47 percent of the value added in Turkish </p><p>production and a similar percentage of Turkey\'s exports.  As </p><p>the numbers suggest, these members include the country\'s </p><p>largest industrial holdings.  Past chairmen have included a </p><p>number of Kocs and Sabancis, and other members of Turkey\'s </p><p>most exclusive business elite.  Once known as the "Bosphorus </p><p>Billionaires\' Club," the organization has evolved with the </p><p>times, incorporating both representatives of foreign </p><p>companies and the professional managers who have assumed the </p><p>reins of many Turkish companies from their original founders. </p><p> Currently headed by Tuncay Ozilhan, who recently reluctantly </p><p>agreed to extend his two-year tenure for a third year, TUSIAD </p><p>eschews partisanship but is politically active in lobbying </p><p>for business interests.  Recently it has focused on full </p><p>implementation of Turkey\'s ongoing economic reform program </p><p>and advancement of Turkey\'s candidacy for EU membership. </p><p>Based in Istanbul, the organization maintains permanent </p><p>offices in Brussels and Washington. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) While non-partisan, TUSIAD does not pull its </p><p>punches, as Ozilhan\'s mid-January critique of government </p><p>policy on both Iraq and reform showed.  Though both sides </p><p>drew back from confrontation (and privately many TUSIAD </p><p>members argue the media blew the dispute up out of </p><p>proportion), Ozilhan succeeded in laying down a clear marker </p><p>of the importance to Turkey\'s business community of both </p><p>continued economic reform and cooperation with the U.S. </p><p>Beyond its policy advocacy in Ankara and abroad (before </p><p>Copenhagen, TUSIAD delegations inundated European capitals), </p><p>TUSIAD also publishes academic and other papers on essential </p><p>political and economc issues.  A recent study on inflation </p><p>and growth dynamics, for instance, highlighted the economic </p><p>cost of the macro instability Turkey has experienced in </p><p>recent decades. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Flatterers-- MUSIAD: If imitation is the </p><p>sincerest form of flattery, TUSIAD has many admirers.  Its </p><p>success has spawned a slew of similar groups, though </p><p>organized around different operating principles.  Chief among </p><p>these groups is the Independent Industrialists\' and </p><p>Businessmen\'s Association (MUSIAD), which groups many </p><p>mid-rank companies, and is known for more of a "Muslim" </p><p>identity.  Founded in 1990, it currently has 3000 members, </p><p>divided among 30 branches throughout the country.  It </p><p>organizes regular international and local trade fairs and </p><p>trade missions, providing a key mechanism for companies that </p><p>are new to international markets to make a first foray into </p><p>them.  A less developed and structured organization than </p><p>TUSIAD, it consequently relies more on its leadership and its </p><p>views.  The current MUSIAD President, Ali Bayramoglu, has </p><p>adopted a high public profile, commenting on pending economic </p><p>and political issues.  Reflecting his constituency, however, </p><p>he has been less inclined to support the IMF consensus, and </p><p>more given to advocate populist measures.  Given a congruence </p><p>of views, MUSIAD has close ties with the AK party, and a </p><p>dozen organization members were elected to parliament in the </p><p>November elections. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Other groups include the Young Entrepreneurs </p><p>Association (GYIAD) and the Young Turkish Businessmen\'s </p><p>Association (TUGIAD), which both group the younger generation </p><p>of Turkish entrepreneurs.  Both groups have participated in </p><p>USG-organized programs, as has the Business Life Cooperation </p><p>Association (ISHAD).  The latter has taken part in several </p><p>trade missions to the United States, as well as a Public </p><p>Affairs organized Voluntary Visitor Program.  Like Musiad, </p><p>its members come from small to medium-sized enterprises and </p><p>are  Islamic influenced, though they follow modern business </p><p>practices, and do not circumscribe their business activities </p><p>for religious reasons. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) The Specialist-- YASED: While TUSIAD effectively </p><p>represents Turkey\'s largest economic actors, over the last </p><p>quarter-century the Foreign Investors Association (YASED) has </p><p>been similarly active in promoting the interests of foreign </p><p>companies in Turkey.  With 315 members representing 211 </p><p>companies, YASED has fought to improve Turkey\'s business </p><p>environment, focusing both on streamlining the torturous </p><p>procedures for approval of foreign investments and assisting </p><p>its members in their dealings with the Turkish government and </p><p>regulatory bodies.  Reorganized in 1998, YASED developed a </p><p>committee system to address specific sectoral and regulatory </p><p>needs.  It has played a leading role in efforts to draft a </p><p>new investment code and associated regulations and thereby </p><p>improve the investment climate in Turkey.  In a recent </p><p>meeting it reported significant progress, noting that while </p><p>serious issues remained, Turkey\'s new AK government has </p><p>proved much more receptive to its proposals than were its </p><p>predecessors.  (septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Hybrid-- DEIK: If most Turkish business </p><p>organizations are private, the current key actor in </p><p>developing and encouraging international trade had a mixed </p><p>character at its outset.  In its early years the Foreign </p><p>Economic Relations Board (DEIK) received state funding, from </p><p>which it has now graduated.  Instead it is financed </p><p>exclusively by its members and founding organizations, which </p><p>include TUSIAD and TOBB (TOBB\'s Chairman is always the </p><p>titular head of DEIK).   DEIK seeks to encourage </p><p>international trade through bilateral business councils with </p><p>Turkey\'s leading trade partners.  The current 66 councils </p><p>include 1134 representatives of 478 companies.  Generally, </p><p>participating companies have undertaken business activity </p><p>with the target country, or plan to do so.  DEIK essentially </p><p>acts as an intermediary between the public and private </p><p>sectors, due to its close working relations with both </p><p>government bodies and private sector institutions in Turkey. </p><p>It aims to encourage business development, to improve </p><p>conditions for bilateral trade, and to provide a forum for </p><p>delibersations on new avenues and forms of bilateral and </p><p>multilateral cooperation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) TUSBC: For the U.S., the key subset of DEIK (and the </p><p>first council formed) is the Turkish-U.S. Business Council, </p><p>which functions as the counterpart to the American Turkish </p><p>Council (ATC).  Founded in 1985, at the personal urging of </p><p>Turgut Ozal, TUSBC currently has around 100 members.  In </p><p>addition to the major international Washington Conference it </p><p>organizes each March with the ATC, TUSBC also organizes other </p><p>programs, including investment and business seminars </p><p>throughout the U.S. and Turkey visits for American business </p><p>and political leaders.  At its 2003 meeting, it adopted an </p><p>action plan to further strengthen its activities by creating </p><p>a consulting center and reinvigorating its sectoral </p><p>committees. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) TABA Amcham: While TUSBC is the American-Turkish </p><p>Council\'s counterpart, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\'s </p><p>officially certified partner is the Turkish-American Business </p><p>Association (TABA), which was founded at almost the same time </p><p>(1986).  Currently boasting 1000 (mostly Turkish) members in </p><p>7 chapters throughout the country, TABA has also sought to </p><p>enhance business relations and promote investment between the </p><p>two countries.  It has also focused in particular on </p><p>encouraging cooperation in the Caucasus region.  It focuses </p><p>on five sectors-- energy, telecommunication, transportation, </p><p>tourism, and environmental protection-- but has generally </p><p>been less active than its DEIK-affiliated counterpart. </p><p>Recognizing the complications and difficulties resulting from </p><p>the bifurcated organizational structure of Turkish-U.S. </p><p>business relations, some TABA members have recently </p><p>encouraged greater cooperation with TUSBC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Comment: Istanbul\'s diversity of business voices </p><p>provides a valuable resource to the Consulate, both in </p><p>seeking to advance U.S. business interests and in gleaning </p><p>business attitudes to issues of the day.  However, the </p><p>multiplicity of voices can also be confusing, and the mission </p><p>has encouraged greater unity and cooperation among the </p><p>various organizations. Turkey\'s major independent policy </p><p>voices seem determined to use their influence to fill the </p><p>void left by the perceived absence of an effective opposition </p><p>to the majority AK government.  While both sides will no </p><p>doubt try to avoid the heated clash of mid-February, there is </p><p>no doubt that TUSIAD and its counterparts will continue to </p><p>push their message at every opportunity.  End Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
