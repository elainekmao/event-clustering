<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 000535 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2003 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULES ERDOGAN NO LONGER AK </p><p>PARTY (AKP) CHAIRMAN; EXPECTED TO BE RE-ELECTED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by polcounselor John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 </p><p>(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Turkish Constitutional Court\'s 6-5 retroactive ruling </p><p>that AK Party (AKP) chairman Erdogan lost his chairmanship </p><p>when he was forced to resign as a founding member in October </p><p>throws another temporary barrier in Erdogan\'s path to the </p><p>Prime Ministership.  At the same time we understand from the </p><p>comments of a member of the Court that the ruling removes the </p><p>grounds on which the chief prosecutor had opened a case to </p><p>close AK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) From the public statements of Constitutional Court </p><p>justice Kilic and public commentary by legal experts, we </p><p>understand that: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--AK\'s founders\' council has ten days to meet and elect an </p><p>acting chairman; Erdogan is eligible to be elected; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--Once an acting chairman is elected, AK has 45 days in which </p><p>to call a party congress to elect a new chairman; Erdogan is </p><p>eligible to be elected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) We expect AK to elect Erdogan as acting chairman and </p><p>to re-elect him as chairman.  At the same time, the </p><p>continuing efforts of elements of the State to keep Erdogan </p><p>in limbo is causing contacts from across the spectrum to </p><p>begin to doubt that Erdogan will ever assume power </p><p>unencumbered.  The ruling is also generating more speculation </p><p>among AK\'s opposition in and out of parliament that the modus </p><p>vivendi between Erdogan and P.M. Gul, already under strain, </p><p>is breaking down. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The ruling leaves open the theoretical possibility </p><p>that (a) a suit could be filed to declare the Nov. 2002 </p><p>general elections void because Erdogan was listed as chairman </p><p>on the ballots; or (b) that a suit could be filed to </p><p>challenge any AK decision bearing Erdogan\'s signature as </p><p>chairman after he gave up his founding member status October </p><p>17. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Comment: However the technicalities play out, this </p><p>ruling creates further uncertainty about Erdogan\'s course to </p><p>the Prime Ministership.  We expect AKP, and therefore the AK </p><p>government, to be even more preoccupied with the balance of </p><p>power within AKP and between the AK government and the State. </p><p> This will have a dragging effect on an already-burdened </p><p>decision-making process on foreign policy questions of direct </p><p>concern to the U.S. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
