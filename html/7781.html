BEYOND THE </p><p>IMPACT OF WAR, AN ADDITIONAL IMPLICIT CONCERN WAS THE RISK </p><p>THAT AN IRAQ UNFETTERED BY SADDAM\'S REPRESSION COULD TAKE A </p><p>MORE FUNDAMENTALIST TURN THAT COULD LEAD TO NEW RESTRICTIONS </p><p>ON CATHOLIC AND OTHER CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES.  AS NEW </p><p>POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DEVELOPED, WE CAN EXPECT THE HOLY </p><p>SEE AND THE IRAQI BISHOPS TO REMAIN ACTIVE IN PROMOTING THE </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL GUARANTEES FOR </p><p>A MULTI-ETHNIC, RELIGIOUSLY TOLERANT GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA01880 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
