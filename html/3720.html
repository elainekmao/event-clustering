<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 004470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EUR/RUS, DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KIRF, SOCI, PL, RS, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: VATICAN IRE AT NEW RUSSIAN "NYET" TO ITS CLERGY </p><p> </p><p>1.   THE VATICAN HAS SHARPLY CRITICIZED THE RECENT EXPULSION </p><p>OF TWO POLISH PRIESTS FROM RUSSIA.  THIS BRINGS TO FIVE THE </p><p>NUMBER OF CATHOLIC CLERGY EXPELLED FROM RUSSIA THIS YEAR, </p><p>INCLUDING BISHOP JERZY MAZUR OF THE SIBERIAN DIOCESE OF ST. </p><p>JOSEPH.  A TERSE STATEMENT ISSUED SEPTEMBER 9 BY VATICAN </p><p>SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS WARNED, "THIS DEVELOPMENT IS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  04470  131302Z </p><p>SO SERIOUS THAT ALREADY SOME PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT A NEW </p><p>PERSECUTION."  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE HAD YET TO RECEIVE AN </p><p>OFFICIAL EXPLANATION FOR THE EXPULSIONS.  THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>NUNCIO IN MOSCOW, ARCHBISHOP GIORGIO ZUR, HAS PROTESTED TO </p><p>THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY AND VOICED THE VATICAN\'S </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS FOR </p><p>RUSSIA\'S CATHOLIC MINORITY.   THE HEAD OF RUSSIA\'S CATHOLIC </p><p>COMMUNITY, ARCHBISHOP TADEUSZ KONDRUSIEWICZ, APPEALED </p><p>SEPTEMBER 12 TO RUSSIAN AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>GROUPS TO PROTEST WHAT HE CALLED A "LARGE SCALE ANTI- </p><p>CATHOLIC CAMPAIGN."  THE ARCHBISHOP ALSO LAMENTED RECENT </p><p>ACTS OF VANDALISM AGAINST CATHOLIC PROPERTIES. </p><p> </p><p>2.   REFLECTING THE HOLY SEE\'S MOUNTING CONCERN WITH THE </p><p>SITUATION IN RUSSIA, HEADS OF ACCREDITED MISSIONS HAVE BEEN </p><p>CALLED TO A MEETING SEPTEMBER 16 DURING WHICH FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER TAURAN WILL BRIEF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S POSITION ON THE PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH IN RUSSIA. </p><p> </p><p>3.   COMMENT: THE CLERGY EXPULSIONS BEGAN AFTER THE VATICAN </p><p>ELEVATED THE STATUS OF FOUR RUSSIAN CATHOLIC ECCLESIASTICAL </p><p>JURISDICTIONS LAST FEBRUARY, A MOVE SEVERELY CRITICIZED BY </p><p>THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.  THE FACT THAT SOME RUSSIAN </p><p>CATHOLICS AND CLERGY ARE OF POLISH ORIGIN IS ALSO A FACTOR </p><p>IN THE TENSION.  POLISH CLERGY ARE ACCUSED BY THE ORTHODOX </p><p>OF BEING ANTI-RUSSIAN.  THEIR CRITICS SAY THEY CELEBRATE </p><p>MASS IN POLISH, FOMENT ANTI-RUSSIAN SENTIMENTS AND DON\'T </p><p>LEARN THE LANGUAGE. YET THE HOLY SEE SAYS THEY SEND POLISH </p><p>AND OTHER SLAVIC CLERGY TO RUSSIA BECAUSE A) THEY CAN LEARN </p><p>THE LANGUAGE EASILY, B) THEY UNDERSTAND RUSSIAN CULTURE AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04470  131302Z </p><p>C) THERE AREN\'T YET ENOUGH TRAINED RUSSIAN PRIESTS.  THE </p><p>ORTHODOX CHURCH NEVERTHELESS REGARDS CATHOLICISM AS AN </p><p>ELEMENT OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION THAT BOTH FASCINATES AND </p><p>DISTURBS.  AT A TIME WHEN SECULAR RUSSIA IS OPENING UP MORE </p><p>AND MORE TO THE WEST, THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, FOR WHICH SUCH </p><p>OPENNESS IS A THREAT TO THE NATIONAL, CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>IDENTITY OF RUSSIA, WILL EXERCISE ITS STILL CONSIDERABLE </p><p>INFLUENCE WITH THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES TO PROTECT ITS </p><p>POSITION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>HARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA04470 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
