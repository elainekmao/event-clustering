<p>S E C R E T  STATE 196513 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP EXCLUSIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:   DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:         PTER </p><p>SUBJECT:     IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET    ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE FOLLOWING SIRO ANALYSIS OF IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR </p><p>TERRORISM IS BEING SENT AS A PART OF A PACKAGE OF </p><p>INTELLIGENCE TO REINFORCE THE VICE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>PRESENTATION ON TERRORISM DURING HIS TALKS WITH HOST </p><p>COUNTRIES.  OTHER ANALYSES DEAL WITH LIBYA AND BEIRUT AND </p><p>WILL BE TRANSMITTED SEPTEL.  ADDRESSEE MISSIONS AND SIRO </p><p>SHOULD COORDINATE BEST MEANS TO COMMUNICATE CONTENTS OF </p><p>THESE STUDIES TO RESPONSIBLE, INTERESTED AGENCIES OF HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENTS AT APPROPRIATELY HIGH LEVEL.  REACTIONS </p><p>SHOULD BE REPORTED IN TERREP EXCLUSIVE CHANNELS AS WELL </p><p>AS OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  QUOTE: UPDATE ON IRANIAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM: 23 JUNE </p><p>1985.  IRANIAN-BACKED TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ALMOST 30 ATTACKS SINCE SEPTEMBER 1984. </p><p>IRAQ, FRANCE, AND THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO BE THE </p><p>PRIMARY TARGETS.  WHILE MOST OF THE RECENT INCIDENTS </p><p>ATTRIBUTABLE TO IRANIAN-BACKED GROUPS HAVE OCCURRED IN </p><p>THE MIDDLE EAST, THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT </p><p>IRANIAN OPERATIONAL ACTIVITY IS CONTINUING IN OTHER PARTS </p><p>OF THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>.  IRAQ HAS SUFFERED SEVEN OR EIGHT TERRORIST ATTACKS AT </p><p>THE HANDS OF IRANIAN-SPONSORED GROUPS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>ATTEMPTED BOMBING OF FOUR IRAQI DIPLOMATS\' CARS IN ATHENS </p><p>LAST DECEMBER.  A GREEK BOMB DISPOSAL EXPERT WAS KILLED </p><p>IN ONE OF THESE INCIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>.  THERE WERE ALSO THREE OR FOUR ATTACKS INSIDE IRAQ, </p><p>INCLUDING TWO BOMBINGS IN PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSAYN\'S </p><p>HOMETOWN OF TIKRIT. </p><p> </p><p>.  IRAN TRAINS AND FINANCES SEVERAL IRAQI DISSIDENT </p><p>GROUPS, SUCH AS THE ISLAMIC ACTION ORGANIZATION THAT </p><p>CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE BOMBINGS IN ATHENS, THAT ARE </p><p>DEDICATED TO OVERTHROWING IRAQI PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSAYN. </p><p>IF IRAN SUFFERS FURTHER SETBACKS IN ITS WAR WITH IRAQ, </p><p>TEHRAN MAY ACCELERATE ITS EFFORT TO HIT IRAQI TARGETS </p><p>WHEREVER THEY ARE VULNERABLE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE UNITED STATES AND FRANCE HAVE BEEN THE MAIN FOCUS </p><p>OF IRANIAN-SPONSORED TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN LEBANON.  OVER </p><p>THE PAST 10 MONTHS, THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT </p><p>PRO-IRANIAN SHI\'AS IN LEBANON HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>AT LEAST 19 INCIDENTS, INCLUDING EIGHT ATTACKS AGAINST US </p><p>AND SIX AGAINST FRENCH TARGETS: </p><p> </p><p>.  THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO REMOVE ANY REASONABLE </p><p>DOUBTS OF IRANIAN COLLUSION WITH LEBANESE SHI\'A </p><p>TERRORISTS WHO CARRIED OUT THE BOMB ATTACKS ON THE US </p><p>MARINE BARRACKS, THE AMERICAN EMBASSY AND THE FRENCH </p><p>MILITARY HEADQUARTERS IN BEIRUT IN L983.  THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>POINTS OF CONTACT BETWEEN THE TERRORISTS AND IRAN ARE THE </p><p>SHAYKH ABDALLAH BARRACKS IN THE BAQA\' VALLEY, CONTROLLED </p><p>BY THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD, AND THE IRANIAN </p><p>EMBASSY IN DAMASCUS, PARTICULARLY AMBASSADOR MUTASHAMIPUR. </p><p> </p><p>.  ISLAMIC JIHAD CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR KIDNAPPING </p><p>FOUR PRIVATE US CITIZENS, AND PRO-IRANIAN SHIAS ALMOST </p><p>CERTAINLY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ABDUCTING ANOTHER AMERICAN </p><p>ON 9 JUNE.  HIZBALLAH ELEMENTS NOW HOLD SEVEN AMERICANS </p><p>SOMEWHERE IN LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>.  RADICAL SHIA TERRORISTS PROBABLY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>THE MURDER OF THREE MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH OBSERVER FORCE </p><p>IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY, THE KIDNAPPING OF THREE FRENCH </p><p>DIPLOMATS IN MARCH--TWO OF WHOM ARE STILL BEING HELD BY </p><p>THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC JIHAD (HIZBALLAH), TOGETHER WITH </p><p>THE SEVEN AMERICANS--AND THE ATTEMPTED KIDNAPPING OF A </p><p>FRENCH JOURNALIST IN APRIL.  ISLAMIC JIHAD PUBLICLY </p><p>CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THREE OF THESE INCIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>.  RADICAL SHIAS MAY HAVE KIDNAPPED TWO BRITISH CITIZENS </p><p>IN WEST BEIRUT ON 14 AND 15 MARCH.  THE TWO WERE </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASED, PERHAPS BECAUSE THEIR CAPTORS </p><p>REALIZED THEY WERE NOT AMERICAN.  A BRITISH PROFESSOR AT </p><p>THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN BEIRUT WAS KIDNAPPED IN MAY, </p><p>PROBABLY BECAUSE HE WAS MISTAKEN FOR AN AMERICAN.  HE WAS </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND DEAD. </p><p> </p><p>.  THE RADICAL SHIA GROUPS IN LEBANON--FUNDED, SUPPLIED, </p><p>AND TRAINED BY IRAN--ARE DEDICATED TO BRINGING ABOUT AN </p><p>ISLAMIC REVOLUTION IN LEBANON.  THEY CONSIDER THE </p><p>ELIMINATION OF ANY WESTERN, PARTICULARLY AMERICAN, </p><p>PRESENCE IN LEBANON (SUCH AS THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>BEIRUT AND CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS </p><p>PRESBYTERIAN MISSIONARIES--AND THE CATHOLIC RELIEF </p><p>SERVICE) TO BE BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARD ACHIEVING THEIR </p><p>GOAL.  IN ADDITION, IRAN HAS ENCOURAGED ATTACKS AGAINST </p><p>FRENCH TARGETS BECAUSE OF FRANCE\'S SUPPORT FOR IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>PRO-IRANIAN TERRORISTS CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN WESTERN </p><p>EUROPE, ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN NO ATTACKS OTHER THAN </p><p>THE FOUR BOMBINGS IN ATHENS SINCE SEPTEMBER.  EVIDENCE </p><p>INDICATES IRAN USES ITS NETWORK OF DIPLOMATIC AND </p><p>CULTURAL MISSIONS TO SUPPORT THESE TERRORIST OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>.  LAST NOVEMBER, SEVEN PRO-IRANIAN LEBANESE SHIA WERE </p><p>ARRESTED IN LADISPOLI, ITALY FOR PLANNING A CAR BOMB </p><p>ATTACK AGAINST THE US EMBASSY IN ROME. </p><p> </p><p>.  IN FEBRUARY, TWO IRANIANS WERE CONVICTED IN SPAIN FOR </p><p>THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN A PLOT TO HIJACK A SAUDI AIRLINER. </p><p> </p><p>.  IN MARCH, SEVERAL IRANIANS WERE EXPELLED FROM FRANCE </p><p>FOR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>.  FRAGMENTARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS IRAN CONTINUES TO TRACK </p><p>ANTI-KHOMEINI EXILES IN EUROPE.  ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS </p><p>COULD OCCUR AT ANY TIME. </p><p> </p><p>.  THE TWO HIJACKERS OF TWA FLIGHT 847 THAT LEFT ATHENS </p><p>ON 14 JUNE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF HIZBALLAH, BUT </p><p>THEIR COMMUNIQUES CLEARLY INDICATED THE INFLUENCE OF </p><p>IRANIAN PROPAGANDA.  HIZBALLAH ELEMENTS IN LEBANON </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY TOOK CONTROL OF THE HIJACKING, HOWEVER, AND </p><p>NOW HOLD INDEPENDENTLY OF AMAL SOME OF THE REMAINING </p><p>AMERICAN PASSENGERS.  THE HIZBALLAH MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO </p><p>BLOCK ANY DECISION BY AMAL TO RELEASE THE AMERICAN </p><p>PASSENGERS UNDER THE LATTER\'S CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>THE HIJACKING OF TWA 847 AND THE FATE OF ITS PASSENGERS </p><p>HAS BECOME ENMESHED IN AN INTERNAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN </p><p>HIZBALLAH AND AMAL FOR DOMINANT INFLUENCE AMONG THE SHIA </p><p>COMMUNITY.  HIZBALLAH IS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH TEHRAN ON </p><p>THIS QUESTION.  THE LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS OF THIS </p><p>STRUGGLE FOR TEHRAN, SYRIA, ISRAEL AND THE ENTIRE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST ARE OBVIOUS, AND COULD BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. </p><p> </p><p>IRAN CONTINUES TO TRAIN AND PROVIDE OTHER SUPPORT TO </p><p>DISSIDENTS IN THE PERSIAN GULF, ASIA AND AFRICA. </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS COULD BE ENCOURAGED BY IRAN AT ANY TIME. </p><p> </p><p>.  SHIA DISSIDENTS FROM SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, AND BAHRAIN </p><p>ARE RECEIVING MILITARY TRAINING IN IRAN AND SOME HAVE </p><p>RETURNED HOME TO UNDERTAKE SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY.  RECENT </p><p>SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES IN BAHRAIN, TWO BOMBINGS CLAIMED BY </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD IN SAUDI ARABIA IN MAY, AND THE SUICIDE CAR </p><p>BOMB ATTACK ON THE AMIR OF KUWAIT INDICATE AN INCREASING </p><p>THREAT FROM IRANIAN-TRAINED TERRORISTS AGAINST MODERATE </p><p>ARAB REGIMES.  THIS THREAT COULD IMPACT DIRECTLY UPON THE </p><p>VITAL INTERESTS OF WESTERN EUROPE, SUCH AS ACCESS TO OIL </p><p>AND PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>.  IRAN IS INVOLVED IN AGITATION AND PROPAGANDA ACTIVITY </p><p>AMONG MUSLIM POPULATIONS IN COUNTRIES AS DIVERSE AS </p><p>NIGERIA, PAKISTAN, INDONESIA, AND THE PHILIPPINES. </p><p> </p><p>MANY ELEMENTS OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING </p><p>SEVERAL SENIOR OFFICIALS, ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN </p><p>TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  FOR EXAMPLE, DIRECT LINKS BETWEEN </p><p>TEHRAN AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES ABROAD ARE MAINTAINED </p><p>THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND THE PASDARAN </p><p>(REVOLUTIONARY GUARD).  SO LONG AS THE CHARACTER OF THE </p><p>CURRENT REGIME REMAINS THE SAME, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT </p><p>IRAN\'S POLICY OF SPONSORING TERRORISM WILL CHANGE.  WE </p><p>ARE THEREFORE FACING A LONGTERM PROBLEM OF HOW TO </p><p>MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF IRANIAN TERRORIST POLICIES, </p><p>PERSUADE IRAN TO ABANDON THEM, PROTECT MODERATE ARAB </p><p>REGIMES AND PREVENT TERRORISM FROM SPILLING OVER INTO </p><p>WESTERN EUROPE.  THERE ARE THREE AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR </p><p>WESTERN ACTION: </p><p> </p><p>.  FIND WAYS TO MAKE TEHRAN PAY A PRICE FOR ITS CONTINUED </p><p>SUPPORT OF TERRORISM; </p><p> </p><p>.  STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY AND WILL OF OTHER STATES TO </p><p>RESIST IRANIAN TERRORISM; </p><p> </p><p>.  TRY TO ENCOURAGE SYRIA, AFTER THE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL </p><p>FROM LEBANON, TO EXERT ITSELF MORE FORCEFULLY IN </p><p>CURTAILING IRANIAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM BASED IN LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>UNLESS RAPID DECISIVE COLLECTIVE ACTION CAN BE TAKEN SO </p><p>AS TO STEM THE GROWING RADICAL SHIA CANCER, STRONGLY </p><p>INFLUENCED AND DIRECTED FROM TEHRAN, IT IS LIKELY THAT </p><p>THERE WILL BE A STILL MORE RAPID SPREAD OF RADICALISM </p><p>INTO OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES, TOGETHER WITH AN INCREASED </p><p>SPILLOVER INTO WESTERN EUROPE AND OTHER COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ARMACOST </p><p></p></div>
