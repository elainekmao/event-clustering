<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 COLOMBO 000657 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PASS TO USAID AMBASSADOR WENDY CHAMBERLIN, AA/ANE; GORDON </p><p>WEST, DAA/ANE; BERNADETTE BUNDY, ANE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR D, SA, SA/INS, LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: REVISED DONOR STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES RE FOREIGN </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Colombo 606 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an ACTION request, please see para. 6. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary: This cable contains the latest draft of </p><p>the Donors\' statement of principles regarding provision of </p><p>foreign assistance to Sri Lanka as the peace process </p><p>proceeds.  The text has been agreed to (ad referendum) by </p><p>all of Sri Lanka\'s major donors at a meeting at Ambassador </p><p>Wills\' residence April 15.  The meeting produced only minor </p><p>revisions to the text agreed the week before and reported in </p><p>reftel.  The meeting did produce, however, a major change to </p><p>the manner in which the statement of principles will be </p><p>presented: donors agreed to defer the decision on whether to </p><p>make the document public at the June Tokyo Donor Forum.  The </p><p>donor group will first present the statement privately to </p><p>the GSL and LTTE, through the Norwegians, at the seventh </p><p>round of peace talks to begin April 29 in Thailand.  Based </p><p>on the reactions of the GSL and LTTE to the document, the </p><p>donor community will decide whether to make the statement </p><p>public at Tokyo or not.  Insofar as possible, the donors </p><p>will keep the document private unless agreed otherwise.  The </p><p>group also discussed a common press posture, should the </p><p>document become public.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The principal donors to Sri Lanka reconvened April </p><p>15 at Jefferson House to discuss proposed revisions by </p><p>capitals to the text agreed the previous week and reported </p><p>reftel.  The meeting produced only minor revisions to the </p><p>text itself (see para. 7).  The most significant revision to </p><p>the text was to insert an explicit distinction between </p><p>development assistance and humanitarian assistance: the </p><p>former would be linked to the statement of principles, but </p><p>the latter would not.  Most of the afternoon\'s discussion </p><p>focused on how best to present the statement to the GSL and </p><p>LTTE, so as not to alienate either party (especially the </p><p>LTTE) and thereby upset the peace process.  The Japanese </p><p>Ambassador had earlier in the day called a meeting of the </p><p>four co-chairs of the June Tokyo conference (Japan, US, the </p><p>EU and Norway) to discuss how the donor community should </p><p>handle the document.  The "quartet" decided that it would be </p><p>best to make the document a private message to the GSL and </p><p>the LTTE from the donor community, rather than make it </p><p>public in Tokyo in June (as agreed by the donor group the </p><p>previous week).  The quartet then presented that </p><p>recommendation for consideration by the wider donor </p><p>community during the all-hands meeting at Jefferson House. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Some donors (notably Canada and the Netherlands) </p><p>disagreed with the quartet and argued the document would be </p><p>effective only as a public declaration by the donor </p><p>community; others saw merit in a quieter approach.  The </p><p>group ultimately reached a consensus to present the </p><p>statement of principles privately to the GSL and LTTE, </p><p>through the Norwegian facilitators, at the Thailand peace </p><p>talks scheduled for April 29.  Both parties will then have a </p><p>chance to react to the document in subsequent weeks.  Based </p><p>on the reactions, the donor community will then decide </p><p>whether to make the document public at the June Tokyo Donor </p><p>Forum (as originally planned).  All agreed that it was </p><p>likely the document would be leaked at some stage, and </p><p>discussed a common press posture should the document become </p><p>public. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The donors agreed to consult capitals on the new </p><p>text as well as the new manner of presentation by April 23, </p><p>when the group will convene again at Jefferson House. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Action Request: Request Washington agencies\' </p><p>comments/concurrence prior to April 23 on the text in para. </p><p>7, the proposed manner for presenting the document described </p><p>in para. 8, and the "if asked" press guidance in para. 9. </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>Statement of Principles </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>7. (SBU) Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>                    DRAFT April 15, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>      Consensus Paper on Basic Principles for Peace and </p><p>                         Development </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Purpose </p><p>To ensure sustainable resources for peace and development in </p><p>Sri Lanka through a process that links development </p><p>assistance to adherence to basic principles. This is not </p><p>intended to prescribe but rather to take forward the </p><p>dialogue and partnership among GOSL, LTTE and donors, on </p><p>shared concerns. </p><p> </p><p>2. Background and Rationale </p><p>Sri Lanka is in a period of transition, somewhere between </p><p>war and peace but not yet definitively `post conflict.\' </p><p>Progress towards peace and political settlement must be </p><p>encouraged and supported by all parties. </p><p> </p><p>This paper highlights basic agreed principles and suggests </p><p>milestones that link development assistance to the peace </p><p>process. The principles and milestones relate to development </p><p>assistance, not humanitarian aid. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka can boast significant progress towards peace. The </p><p>ceasefire agreement is one year strong, regular peace </p><p>negotiations have demonstrated commitment to address core </p><p>issues such as a political settlement, human rights, </p><p>humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance and gender. </p><p>Development achievements are also noteworthy:  SIHRN has </p><p>been established and acknowledged by the international </p><p>community; NERF is operational; quick impact projects are </p><p>being approved; the paper, "Regaining Sri Lanka," along with </p><p>a multilateral group-supported assessment for immediate and </p><p>medium term rehabilitation needs, will be tabled at a </p><p>pledging conference in Tokyo in June 2003. </p><p> </p><p>The peace process and the development process are mutually </p><p>reinforcing.  There is need, therefore, to develop </p><p>mechanisms for ensuring they complement each other. </p><p> </p><p>3. Basic Principles </p><p> </p><p>3.1 Progress on Political settlement </p><p>The main message of the Oslo Declaration is that a viable </p><p>political settlement should be the desired outcome of the </p><p>peace process.    Through six rounds of talks, progress and </p><p>commitments have been made on substantive issues.  At the </p><p>Hakone talks, the parties to the negotiation reiterated </p><p>their commitment to develop a federal system based on </p><p>internal self-determination within a united Sri Lanka.  This </p><p>consensus paper recognises that this process will take time, </p><p>and aims to enhance this positive momentum. </p><p> </p><p>3.2 Respect for human rights and security </p><p>Human security is central to the post conflict peace </p><p>settlement process.  It encompasses freedom for civilians </p><p>from pervasive threats, ensures their protection and safety, </p><p>and promotes respect for human rights by all parties. </p><p> </p><p>The Hakone peace talks expressed the parties\' commitment to </p><p>respect and uphold human rights.  We encourage expeditious </p><p>development and implementation of the human rights roadmap. </p><p>There has also been ongoing substantive dialogue between the </p><p>LTTE and a coalition of organisations led by UNICEF on child </p><p>rights and children affected by war. </p><p> </p><p>Considerable commitments were made during 2002 regarding </p><p>land tenure and access issues in conflict-affected areas, </p><p>and on the rights of IDPs.  These positive initiatives now </p><p>require support and implementation.  Adoption of the Guiding </p><p>Principles on Internal Displacement would support these </p><p>initiatives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.3 Participation and Representation </p><p>The Oslo Declaration and SIHRN\'s Guiding Principles </p><p>underscore the importance of recognising the needs and </p><p>aspirations of all ethnic communities as well as actively </p><p>involving beneficiaries of development assistance in </p><p>planning their own development. </p><p> </p><p>At present, ordinary Sri Lankans need a better understanding </p><p>of the peace process.  Wider public knowledge and dialogue </p><p>on the negotiations would strengthen public support for </p><p>peace. </p><p> </p><p>Keys to effective engagement with international actors on </p><p>development, investment and trade will be establishing </p><p>pluralistic, representative government and open, market- </p><p>oriented economies in conflict-affected areas. In the latter </p><p>connection, the donors call on the parties to adopt economic </p><p>policies aimed at reducing poverty and encouraging private </p><p>sector activity. </p><p> </p><p>3.4 Democracy </p><p>The donors accept that it is for the parties to negotiate </p><p>constitutional arrangements with which the country as a </p><p>whole will be comfortable.   The donors\' concern is that the </p><p>system must be democratic, transparent and accountable. </p><p> </p><p>There is overwhelming support for a greater degree of </p><p>autonomy at local levels, with representative decentralised </p><p>local government that is accountable, responsive to local </p><p>needs, makes better use of available local resources and </p><p>delivers efficient services.    While this transition will </p><p>take time, developing and strengthening local government </p><p>structures expeditiously will help build trust within and </p><p>between communities and create an enabling environment for </p><p>increased donor support.  The Hakone proposal to prepare for </p><p>local government elections in the North and East is a </p><p>welcome initiative. </p><p> </p><p>3.5 Transparency and Management of Finances </p><p>With additional resources being committed in the conflict- </p><p>affected areas, the open and transparent management of these </p><p>resources would increase community and donor confidence. </p><p>While the guidelines for SIHRN and the NERF are positive </p><p>steps, the lack of clarity over systems of revenue </p><p>generation, resource distribution and taxation in conflict- </p><p>affected areas needs to be resolved.  The donors urge the </p><p>parties, in the management of public finance and development </p><p>assistance, to combat waste, fraud, and all other corrupt </p><p>practices. </p><p> </p><p>4. Reconciliation </p><p>Ultimately, the goal of the peace process will be </p><p>reconciliation between and among communities island-wide. </p><p>This will require the underlying causes of tensions between </p><p>and amongst communities island-wide to be addressed and </p><p>reconciled.  National frameworks such as that for Relief, </p><p>Rehabilitation and Reconciliation (3R) make important </p><p>recommendations which address both equity and access </p><p>imbalances in Sri Lanka.  Issues such as language policy, </p><p>education and public sector reform require immediate action, </p><p>additional resources and unwavering political commitment. </p><p> </p><p>5. Milestones </p><p>The success of the framework will depend on the setting of </p><p>realistic and achievable milestones.  The immediate </p><p>priorities include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Full implementation of the ceasefire agreement, including </p><p>unrestricted access by the SLMM. </p><p> </p><p>-- Underage recruitment: children no longer subject to </p><p>recruitment; progress on the reintegration of current and </p><p>former underage recruits into communities </p><p> </p><p>-- Adoption of the "plan" leading to a final political </p><p>settlement. </p><p> </p><p>-- Clarification of the respective roles of central and </p><p>local government in the administration of taxation and the </p><p>management of public funds. </p><p> </p><p>-- Respect for basic operating principles of international </p><p>humanitarian and development assistance agencies. </p><p> </p><p>-- Progress on settlement of land and livelihood issues on </p><p>occupied lands, including in the HSZ. </p><p> </p><p>-- Development of structures of governance at the sub- </p><p>national level that are representative, transparent and </p><p>accountable. </p><p> </p><p>-- No laying of new mines and increased mine clearance. </p><p> </p><p>As the peace process progresses, there will need to be </p><p>dialogue to establish further milestones in emerging areas </p><p>such as security and related matters. </p><p> </p><p>Annex 1 contains sample, illustrative milestones in support </p><p>of the above principles. </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>(Note: Donors agreed to label the document "Confidential," </p><p>not to classify the text per se, but to convey the shared </p><p>intention to keep the document private.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Proposed Manner of Presentation </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) As agreed by the donor group, the Norwegians will </p><p>present the statement of principles privately to the GSL and </p><p>LTTE at the Thailand peace talks scheduled for April 29. </p><p>Both parties will then have a chance to react to the </p><p>document in subsequent weeks.  Based on the reactions, the </p><p>donor community will then decide whether to make the </p><p>document public at the June Tokyo Donor Forum (as originally </p><p>planned). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>"If asked" Press Guidance </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Consistent with the common press posture agreed by </p><p>the donor group, Mission has developed the following "if </p><p>asked" press guidance in the event the statement of </p><p>principles becomes public. </p><p> </p><p>Question:  Is the donor community in Sri Lanka developing </p><p>"conditionalities" that link development assistance to </p><p>progress in the peace talks? </p><p> </p><p>Answer:  Development aid won\'t work unless conditions on the </p><p>ground permit development to occur.  Knowing this, the donor </p><p>community is moving toward consensus on links between </p><p>progress in the peace process and aid for peace. </p><p> </p><p>Question:  Why hasn\'t the donor community shared these </p><p>deliberations with the Sri Lankan public? </p><p>Answer:  We felt it appropriate for the donor community to </p><p>take its concerns directly and privately to the GSL and the </p><p>LTTE.  In turn, it is up to the GSL and the LTTE to </p><p>determine whether to make our concerns public. </p><p> </p><p>Question:  Why have you kept these discussions from the GSL </p><p>and the LTTE? </p><p> </p><p>Answer:  It was the donor community\'s intention to share its </p><p>concerns, through the Government of Norway, with the GSL and </p><p>the LTTE during the peace talks to be convened in Japan. </p><p> </p><p>Question:  What do you mean by "links"? </p><p> </p><p>Answer:  Again, this question is for the parties to answer. </p><p>Clearly, though, it is fruitless to rebuild schools when </p><p>children are still subject to recruitment.  Agricultural aid </p><p>will lead to prosperity, but not until promises to lay no </p><p>new landmines are kept and mine clearance activities are </p><p>enhanced.  More generally, international and development </p><p>assistance agencies cannot hope to work in conflict areas </p><p>unless their basic operating principles are respected. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
