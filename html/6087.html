<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000452 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INR/R/MR AND AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION NAM/IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "New challenges for NAM" the </p><p>      pro-government weekly the "Sunday Mirror" dedicated </p><p>      its March 2 editorial to calling on the Non Aligned </p><p>      Movement (NAM) to transform into "a reasonable, </p><p>      balanced and objective counter-force" in </p><p>      international issues.  "In this regard, the call by </p><p>      NAM for a peaceful resolution to the Iraq arms </p><p>      crisis becomes even more relevant," the editorial </p><p>      stated. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The NAM, created forty-eight years ago, was born to </p><p>      defend the freedom of those countries in the </p><p>      developing world that did not want to be constrained </p><p>      by allegiance to any of the super-powers of the </p><p>      time, namely the U. S. A. and the Soviet Union. </p><p>      Today, that bipolar scenario has changed with the </p><p>      demise of the Soviet Union, leaving the U. S. A. as </p><p>      the only superpower.  However, a unipolar situation </p><p>      has not made the world a safer place to live in and </p><p>      smaller nations, especially in the Third World, have </p><p>      become even more vulnerable.  Therefore, NAM becomes </p><p>      even more relevant as it now has to protect its </p><p>      members from being swallowed up by the one </p><p>      increasingly dictatorial superpower, the U. S. A. </p><p>      In this lopsided world order, the prospect of a </p><p>      world divided on lines of wealth, race or religious </p><p>      faith is real, but a calamitous one for human kind. </p><p>      Because of the diversity of its nationalities, NAM </p><p>      offers the only hope for a reasonable, balanced and </p><p>      objective counter-force.  But in order for that hope </p><p>      to be translated into reality, NAM members are </p><p>      required to strengthen their solidarity with each </p><p>      other. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .In order not be misunderstood, NAM needs to </p><p>      proclaim loudly and clearly that for which the </p><p>      movement stands.  First, it should acknowledge the </p><p>      supremacy of the United Nations while demanding that </p><p>      the world body be reformed so that its structures </p><p>      and actions follow modern concepts of democracy, </p><p>      which the developed world has been preaching to the </p><p>      rest of the world.  NAM should further affirm its </p><p>      adherence to the rule of law, while not only </p><p>      agitating for, but acting to ensure collective peace </p><p>      and human security.  In this regard, the call by NAM </p><p>      for a peaceful resolution to the Iraq arms crisis </p><p>      becomes even more relevant.  NAM reiterated its call </p><p>      to Iraq to comply with resolution 1441 of the U. N. </p><p>      Security Council, while at the same time condemning </p><p>      the planned unilateral military actions of the U. </p><p>      S., and a few of its allies who seek to plunge the </p><p>      world into catastrophe for no better reason than to </p><p>      secure for themselves the rich oil fields of the </p><p>      Gulf region.  In the final analysis, NAM should not </p><p>      only be aware of the economic motives of the latest </p><p>      imperialist wars of the U. S. and its allies, but </p><p>      should demand responses to the needs of the majority </p><p>      of the people of the world." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
