Description of the activity: A one-hour interactive AETN </p><p>Dialogue on "CAFTA". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Date: January 15, 2003; Fiscal year: FY-03, QTR 2 </p><p> </p><p>3. Objective:  To provide Dr. Barbara Bowie-Whitman an </p><p>opportunity to make clear to a wide Honduran audience the </p><p>historic importance of the CAFTA negotiations that began </p><p>January 8th. To provide a venue for a frank and open </p><p>discussion of the concerns of the Honduran government and </p><p>private sector in regard to Honduras\' participation in </p><p>CAFTA. To generate media coverage of the CAFTA negotiations </p><p>and the importance of USAID programs and the World Trade </p><p>Organization to that process. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MPP Goal: Promote the CAFTA process for regional </p><p>integration, Honduran economic development and agricultural </p><p>diversification, and U.S. exports. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Audience reached: 60 guests, Minister of Commerce and </p><p>Industry; Minister of Labor; Representative of the Honduran </p><p>Counsel for Private Enterprise (COHEP), trade advisors, </p><p>officials from the public and private sectors, labor </p><p>leaders, media and USAID and Economic officers. </p><p> </p><p>6. Result/Impact: Excellent/Excellent. Dr. Barbara Bowie- </p><p>Whitman was an excellent interlocutor with this panel of </p><p>high-ranking Government officials and private sector </p><p>panelists. She handled the questions in depth and was able </p><p>to discuss the CAFTA process from the perspective of a small </p><p>country. Her discussion of the important role of USAID was </p><p>on-target since we had invited the Director of USAID </p><p>Honduras to participate in the panel and in our post-AETN </p><p>press conference. The post-AETN press conference with USAID </p><p>officials and the panelists, all of whom stayed around for </p><p>about another half-hour, generated wide media coverage of </p><p>the AETN. </p><p> </p><p>7. The panelists were Norman Garcia, Minister of Commerce </p><p>and Industry, German Leitzelar, Minister of Labor, and Jesus </p><p>Canahuati from the Counsel for Private Enterprise. </p><p> </p><p>Tegucigalpa\'s participation in the January 15th AETN </p><p>dialogue on CAFTA with U.S FTAA Coordinator Dr. Barbara </p><p>Bowie-Whitman served to explain the importance of such </p><p>essential elements of free trade as security measures since </p><p>9/11 and how they affect the growing trade between Honduras </p><p>and the USA, the need for agricultural diversification and </p><p>the important role USAID programs play, not only in legal </p><p>reform projects, but in increasing competitiveness through </p><p>diversification. Dr. Barbara Bowie-Whitman made convincing </p><p>arguments for the benefits of CAFTA for all Hondurans. </p><p> </p><p>Following the AETN dialogue, the panelists and USAID </p><p>officers participated in a 15-minuts press conference. The </p><p>USAID Director highlighted Dr. Bowie-Whitman\'s statements </p><p>about the key role that USAID competiveness and agricultural </p><p>diversification projects play. Today\'s dailies headliners </p><p>included: "Tiempo": To lower subsides in 15 years is the </p><p>U.S. government goal" and "La Tribuna" - With CAFTA, U.S. </p><p>proposes to reinforce security in Central American ports." </p><p>The "El Heraldo"- U.S. won\'t eliminate all agricultural </p><p>subsidies - story focused on the need to reduce subsidies </p><p>world wide. The journalists quoted Dr. Bowie-Whitman </p><p>statements on this issue. The AETN program appeared on major </p><p>Honduran national television and radio news programs </p><p>Abriendo Brecha, TVC, TVN-Hondured, TV-66, TV-11, and Radio </p><p>America. </p><p> </p><p>PAS provided a copy of the AETN dialogue to the President of </p><p>the Honduran Supreme Court, the Minister of Agriculture, the </p><p>Minister of Commerce and the USDA Officer who covers </p><p>Honduras and Guatemala. Also we distributed packages to </p><p>journalists and participants with CAFTA and USTR articles. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Non-USG sources of funding:  None </p><p> </p><p>9.  Quality of USG support:  Excellent.  Post would like to </p><p>thank WHA/PDA Martha Buckley and PA/OBS/P Debra Schackner </p><p>for this initiative and for the quality of the panelist. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer. </p><p></p></div>
