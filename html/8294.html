SUMMARY.  WITH SUPPORT FROM PD, USAID AND USDA, MISSION </p><p>ITALY, AT THE INITIATIVE OF CONGEN FLORENCE, IS COSPONSORING </p><p>A FOUR DAY CONFERENCE ON AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY AT THE </p><p>UNIVERSITY OF BOLOGNA MAY 28-31. HEADLINING THE PROGRAM IS </p><p>NOBEL PRIZE PRIZE WINNER NORMAN BORLAUG, AND SWISS SCIENTIST </p><p>INGO POTRYKUS, THE INVENTOR OF GOLDEN RICE. OTHER LEADING </p><p>AMERICAN SCIENTISTS INCLUDE ROGER BEACHY, FROM THE DANFORTH </p><p>FOUNDATION FOR PLANT SCIENCE, AND THREE SPEAKERS SPONSORED BY </p><p>PD: ALLISON SNOW FROM OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY; CAL QUALSET FROM </p><p>UC-DAVIS; AND RON PHILLIPS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. </p><p>THE SUPPORT OF USAID HAS MADE POSSIBLE THE PARTICIPATION OF </p><p>LEADING FIGURES FROM AFRICA, INDIA, THE PHILLIPINES, </p><p>KAZAKHSTAN, BRAZIL, AND MEXICO. THE LAST DAY AND A HALF OF </p><p>THE CONFERENCE FOCUSES ON THE IMPORTANCE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR </p><p>THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND ON EU AND ITALIAN VIEWS OF </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY. THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE FROM SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>WILL SPEAK AT THE CONFERENCE ON THE ROLE OF BIOTECHNOLOGIES </p><p>IN REDUCING HUNGER. MISSION ITALY CONSIDERS THIS CONFERENCE </p><p>AND THE ASSOCIATED EVENTS WE HAVE PLANNED WITH SNOW, </p><p>PHILLIPS, AND QUALSET IN UDINE, MILAN, TURIN, AND NAPLES TO </p><p>BE A INTEGRAL PART OF OUR SUPPORT FOR U.S. SCIENCE-BASED </p><p>POLICY ON BIOTECHNOLOGY. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE ITALIAN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IN FAVOR OF AGRICULTURAL </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY IS SMALL, BUT INDEPENDENTLY MINDED, AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02331  01 OF 02  280807Z </p><p>UNABASHEDLY VOCAL IN ITS SUPPORT OF A MORE SCIENCE-BASED </p><p>POLICY--SOMETHING STILL FAR FROM THE MINDS OF ITALIAN </p><p>POLICYMAKERS. WE TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY WE CAN TO HIT HOME </p><p>FOUR OF THE SIX ELEMENTS PD HAS PROVIDED WITH THE ROLL-OUT OF </p><p>OUR REQUEST FOR WTO CONSULTATIONS ON THE EU MORATORIUM ON NEW </p><p>APPROVALS: THE SAFETY OF BIOTECH PRODUCTS; THEIR BENEFITS TO </p><p>THE ENVIRONMENT; THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO AGRICULTURAL </p><p>PRODUCTIVITY; AND THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF EU POLICIES ON THE </p><p>ADOPTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD. </p><p>SCIENTISTS ARE IN A GOOD POSITION TO SPEAK ON THSES ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>3. CONSULATES MILAN AND FLORENCE DREW THIS PLANNED PROGRAM TO </p><p>EMBASSY ATTENTION LATE LAST FALL, AND BY FEBRUARY EMBASSY HAD </p><p>AGREED TO UNDERTAKE SUPPORT OF THE CONFERENCE. PD WAS ABLE TO </p><p>SUPPORT THREE SPEAKERS, WHILE USDA AND USAID PROVIDED AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL USD 45,000 TO SUPPORT THE TRAVEL EXPENSES OF U.S. </p><p>AND DEVELOPING COUNTRY SPEAKERS. EMBASSY ESTCOUNS HAS WORKED </p><p>WITH THE UNIVERSITY IN SELECTING DEVELOPING COUNTRY SPEAKERS, </p><p>U.S. SPEAKERS, AND IN SHAPING THE POLICY-ORIENTED PARTS OF </p><p>THE PROGRAM, AND IN CONTACTING GOI OFFICIALS AND ITALIAN </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS.  ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OTHER COSPONSORS-- FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, THE BRITISH COUNCIL--OUR ROLE IN THE CONFERENCE </p><p>DESIGN HAS PROBABLY BEEN THE MORE IMPORTANT. OUR CONTACTS </p><p>WITH AFRICABIO, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS RESULTED IN THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE FROM SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>IN THE CONFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>4. IN SELECTING THE SPEAKERS WE WISHED TO SPONSOR, WE LOOKED </p><p>AT THE MOST PROBABLE REMAINING SCIENTIFIC DISPUTE ABOUT </p><p>AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY--LONG TERM EFFECTS ON </p><p>BIODIVERSITY, OR IN EU-SPEAK, COEXISTENCE. THIS IS AN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02331  01 OF 02  280807Z </p><p>ESPECIALLY SALIENT ISSUE FOR ITALIAN FARMERS, WHO HAVE BEEN </p><p>TOLD REPEATEDLY BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE THAT THE </p><p>MARKET FOR THEIR HIGH VALUE GEOGRAPHICALLY DENOMINATED OR </p><p>"TYPICAL PRODUCTS" COULD BE ENDANGERED BY "CONTAMINATION" </p><p>FROM BIOTECH CROPS AND VARIETIES.  ACCORDINGLY,WE INVITED </p><p>ECOLOGIST ALLISON SNOW FROM OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY TO ADDRESS </p><p>NAPLES. PROFESSOR SNOW IS KNOWN INTERNATIONALLY FOR HER GENE </p><p>FLOW STUDIES INVOLVING BIOTECH VARIETIES. ACCORDINGLY, WE </p><p>INVITED ECOLOGIST ALLISON SNOW FROM OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY TO </p><p>ADDRESS A TWO-DAY CONFERENCE ON BIOTECHNOLOGY IN NAPLES, MAY </p><p>27-28, SPONSORED BY THE CAMPANIE REGION AND THE NATIONAL </p><p>FARMERS ASSOCIATION.  KEY INTERLOCUTORS IN THE ITALIAN </p><p>BIOTECH DEBATE WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN THE CONFERENCE, </p><p>INCLUDING THE ITALIAN AGRICULTURE MINISTER.  PROFESSOR SNOW </p><p>IS KNOWN INTERNATIONALLY FOR HER GENE FLOW STUDIES INVOLVING </p><p>BIOTECH VAIRETIES AND POST RECOGNIZED AN IMPORTANT </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO INSERT SNOW\'S EXPERTISE INTO THE PROGRAM </p><p>AGENDA.  SHE WILL BE THE ONLY AMERICAN PRESENTER IN THE </p><p>NAPLES SPEAKER LINE-UP.  FOR THE SAME REASONS, WE INVITED </p><p>WHEAT BREEDER AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS CALVIN QUALSET (U. OF </p><p>CALIFORNIA DAVIS) TO GIVE A PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF </p><p>UDINE IN THE NORTHEAST AND MOST ANTI BIOTECH CORNER OF ITALY </p><p>NEAR THE AUSTRIAN BORDER.  IN ADDITION TO HIS CREDENTIALS AS </p><p>A PLANT BREEDER, PROFESSOR QUALSET FOUNDED THE GENETIC </p><p>RESOURCES CONSERVATION PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA.
