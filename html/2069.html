<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 001181 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, BTIO, ECON, ECIN, PREL, PGOV, PTER, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: CG\'S INITIAL MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN OF HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY.  ON OCTOBER 15, CG EMI YAMAUCHI MET WITH </p><p>LE THANH HAI, CHAIRMAN OF THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE (PC) </p><p>OF HO CHI MINH CITY (HCMC), ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF AND </p><p>CONOFF.  HAI EXTENDED A WARM WELCOME TO THE CG AND </p><p>EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT SHE WOULD BE BOTH COMFORTABLE </p><p>AND BUSY IN HCMC.  HE SAID THE BTA WILL RESULT IN </p><p>VIETNAMESE COMPANIES PREPARING THEIR GOODS FOR EXPORT, </p><p>AND INTEGRATING WITH U.S. AND GLOBAL MARKETS.  HE SAID </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  01181  01 OF 02  170608Z </p><p>HE WOULD LIKE TO INCREASE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT </p><p>(FDI) IN VIETNAM, AND HOPED THAT THE OVERSEAS PRIVATE </p><p>INVESTMENT CORPORATION (OPIC) WILL HELP TO ATTRACT </p><p>POTENTIAL INVESTORS TO HCMC.  HE WAS HOPEFUL THAT THE </p><p>USG AND OTHER COUNTRIES COULD ARRIVE AT A PEACEFUL </p><p>SETTLEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>------- </p><p>"I HOPE YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY BUSY DURING YOUR TENURE, </p><p>BECAUSE THAT WILL BE A GOOD SIGN." </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2. HAI WELCOMED CG TO HCMC, AND STATED OVER THE NEXT </p><p>THREE YEARS HE HOPED TO CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE GOOD </p><p>WORKING RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS ESTABLISHED WITH CG\'S </p><p>PREDECESSOR.  CG EXPRESSED HER DESIRE TO CONTINUE AND </p><p>STRENGTHEN THEIR RELATIONSHIP ON ALL FRONTS, NOT ONLY </p><p>THOSE RELATED TO TRADE.  SHE OFFERED TO ASSIST HAI WITH </p><p>EMERGING PROGRAMS OR INITIATIVES, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN </p><p>THE AREAS OF CULTURE AND EDUCATION.  HE AGREED THESE </p><p>WERE IMPORTANT AREAS TO SEEK COOPERATION, AS WELL AS </p><p>THE FIELD OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>"WE WANT TO INTEGRATE INTO THE U.S. AND GLOBAL MARKETS </p><p> AS SOON AS POSSIBLE." </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  LE STATED THE APPROVAL OF THE U.S.-VIETNAM </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01181  01 OF 02  170608Z </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT BY THE U.S. SENATE </p><p>DEMONSTRATES GREAT GROWTH AND POTENTIAL FOR THE U.S.- </p><p>VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP.  HE NOW SEES CHALLENGES FOR </p><p>VIETNAMESE ENTREPRENEURS, WHO NEED TO PREPARE THEIR </p><p>PRODUCTS FOR EXPORT, AND FOREIGN ENTREPRENEURS, WHO </p><p>NEED TO TRUST IN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  PRIOR TO RATIFICATION OF THE BTA, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS </p><p>ORGANIZED A DIALOGUE AMONG VIETNAMESE COMPANIES TO </p><p>EXCHANGE IDEAS ABOUT INTEGRATING INTO U.S. MARKETS. </p><p>ACCORDING TO HAI, ONE ISSUE THAT SURFACED IS THAT MANY </p><p>VIETNAMESE COMPANIES MUST IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR </p><p>PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN REGIONAL AND GLOBAL </p><p>EXPORT MARKETS.  HAI SAID THE HCMC TARGET FOR EXPORT </p><p>GROWTH FOR 2001 WAS 20 PERCENT; ALTHOUGH IN THE FIRST </p><p>SIX MONTHS IT REACHED 14 PERCENT, HAI SAID IT WILL BE </p><p>DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN THE BALANCE OF 6 PERCENT IN THE </p><p>CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  HAI SAID THE PC INTENDS TO INCREASE ITS SUPPORT FOR </p><p>AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN VIETNAM EFFORTS TO </p><p>EDUCATE U.S. COMPANIES ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRADE </p><p>WITH VIETNAM.  HE SAID AMERICAN INVESTMENT WOULD SPUR </p><p>GROWTH IN HCMC, AND HE SAID HE PLANNED TO MAKE HCMC A </p><p>MORE ATTRACTIVE DESTINATION FOR FDI.  HE WOULD LIKE </p><p>OPIC TO PLAY A GREATER ROLE IN FACILITATING INVESTMENT </p><p>IN VIETNAM.  DURING THE FIRST 9 MONTHS OF 2001, HCMC </p><p>ATTRACTED A TOTAL OF USD$700 MILLION IN FDI.  THIS WAS </p><p>THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN INVESTMENT OVER THE SAME PERIOD </p><p>LAST YEAR, BUT STILL FALLS SHORT OF TARGETS.  HAI SAID </p><p>HE PARTICULARLY WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP FDI IN THE FIELD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  01181  01 OF 02  170608Z </p><p>OF HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES IN HCMC, WHICH HAS THE LARGEST </p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MARKET IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>"HO CHI MINH CITY IS VIETNAM\'S GATEWAY TO THE WORLD. </p><p>EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD ECONOMY WILL AFFECT VIETNAM, </p><p>BUT IT WILL AFFECT US FIRST." </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  CG TOLD HAI THAT WHILE THE PC HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS </p><p>FOR GROWTH IN HCMC FOLLOWING PASSAGE OF THE BTA, SHE </p><p>WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO TEMPER ENTHUSIASM WITH </p><p>REALISM.  LE RESPONDED THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>ALSO ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HCMC\'S GROWTH RATE, </p><p>BECAUSE A ONE PERCENT INCREASE IN GDP IN HCMC </p><p>TRANSLATES TO GROWTH OF 0.3 PERCENT IN GDP FOR THE </p><p>ENTIRE COUNTRY.  HCMC PROVIDES THE GREATEST SHARE OF </p><p>THE GDP IN VIETNAM, AND WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED </p><p>BY THE ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS FROM 1997-1999.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE CITY\'S ECONOMY PICKED UP AGAIN IN 2000, HAI SAID HE </p><p>ANTICIPATES A SLOWDOWN DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2001 </p><p>DUE TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE. </p><p> </p><p>7.  HAI SAID THAT HCMC\'S SERVICES SECTOR OCCUPIES THE </p><p>LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL HCMC ECONOMY AND IS </p><p>VULNERABLE.  WHILE THE PC\'S AGENDA FOR DEVELOPMENT </p><p>INCLUDES IMPROVEMENTS IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE, </p><p>INCLUDING SEA AND AIRPORTS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, </p><p>BANKING, AND FINANCE, HAI SAID HE ALSO WILL PAY MORE </p><p>ATTENTION TO THE SERVICES SECTOR AND PREPARE SERVICE- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  01181  02 OF 02  170609Z </p><p>ORIENTED COMPANIES FOR EXPORT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>"I BELIEVE THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE SETTLED IN PEACE AND </p><p>COOPERATION, IN LINE WITH THE UN CHARTER, AND THINGS </p><p>WILL SOON BE BACK TO NORMAL." </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  CG ASKED HAI IF HE THOUGHT THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS </p><p>ON THE U.S. HAD AFFECTED THE SERVICES SECTOR IN </p><p>VIETNAM, AS IT HAD IN THE U.S.  LE WOULD NOT ATTRIBUTE </p><p>THE CURRENT SLOWDOWN TO EXTERNAL EVENTS OTHER THAN THE </p><p>GENERAL GLOBAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE OF LATE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  HAI ALSO EXPRESSED HIS PERSONAL CONCERN OVER THE </p><p>USG\'S RESORTING TO MILITARY ACTION TO RESOLVE ITS </p><p>CURRENT ISSUES WITH THE TALIBAN.  HE HOPED THAT SOMEHOW </p><p>A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION COULD BE FOUND, AND NOTED THAT </p><p>THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE "HAVE RECENTLY KNOWN THE MISERY </p><p>OF WAR TOO WELL."  CG REMINDED HIM OF THE USG POSITION </p><p>TO COMBAT ALL TERRORISTS, AND THAT LARGE NATIONS GRIEVE </p><p>FOR THEIR LOSSES AS WELL.  AT THIS HAI EMPHATICALLY </p><p>AGREED.  CG INFORMED HIM OF A PRESS REPORT CONCERNING </p><p>THE RECENT ARREST IN THE U.S. OF VO VAN DUC FOR HIS </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOMBING OF THE VIETNAMESE EMBASSY IN </p><p>BANGKOK IN JUNE.  HAI SAID THAT HE SHARES THE USG\'S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO STOP TERRORISM IN ANY FORM. </p><p> </p><p>10.  HAI CLOSED THE 45-MINUTE MEETING BY TELLING CG </p><p>THAT THE CONSULATE STAFF WAS LIVING IN THE BEST CITY IN </p><p>VIETNAM AND THAT THEIR SECURITY WAS ASSURED.  HE NOTED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  01181  02 OF 02  170609Z </p><p>THAT WHATEVER VIETNAM MAY LACK IN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND </p><p>SOPHISTICATION, IT MAKES UP IN SECURITY. </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENT.  HAI ASSUMED THE POST OF PC CHAIRMAN ONLY </p><p>THIS PAST MAY.  ALTHOUGH THAT MAKES HIM "MAYOR" OF </p><p>HCMC, HIS POSITION IS MORE AKIN TO THAT OF GOVERNOR OF </p><p>AN IMPORTANT PROVINCE, BECAUSE THE HCMC PC REPORTS </p><p>DIRECTLY TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  HIS POSITION </p><p>WIELDS EVEN GREATER INFLUENCE NOW THAT THE HCMC PC HAS </p><p>BEEN GIVEN MORE AUTONOMY TO GENERATE ITS OWN BUDGET. </p><p>CG LOOKS FORWARD TO FUTURE MEETINGS WITH HAI AS HE </p><p>PRESIDES OVER HCMC - VIETNAM\'S ENGINE OF GROWTH.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
