O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Harare\'s Commuter Blues </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  Zimbabwe\'s foreign exchange shortage has </p><p>sidelined most passenger vans, transforming a short </p><p>commute into a twice daily ordeal for residents of </p><p>Harare\'s high-density suburbs.  15-30 minute treks now </p><p>take 2-3 hours, a potential trigger for social unrest. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Few vans still operating </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>2. We recently observed the early morning commute from </p><p>Harare\'s townships and the evening return from the city </p><p>center.  Residents tell us their commute has never been </p><p>as grueling, with most privately-owned vans grounded for </p><p>want of parts or fuel.  Harare is still -- compared with </p><p>other developing world capitals -- small, sparsely- </p><p>populated and unchaotic.  By private vehicle, it only </p><p>takes 15-20 minutes to drive downtown from the city\'s </p><p>most distant townships.  In fact, many residents walk 6- </p><p>10 kilometers to/from work, although this often takes </p><p>several hours each way and is obviously less practical </p><p>for those in professional attire. </p><p> </p><p>Commuter Angst </p><p>-------------- </p><p>3. For most, getting a spot in a crowded van is a </p><p>cheerless and demeaning process.  In the morning, we </p><p>witnessed hoards of commuters, anxious about disciplinary </p><p>sanctions for tardiness, jockeying with each other for </p><p>the few vans that pulled up.  Many young men hang from </p><p>fenders and side-mirrors while the old and meek stand </p><p>little chance.  Most vans do not service more distant </p><p>suburbs like Kuwadzana and Dzivaresekwa, preferring to </p><p>cash in on more frequent runs between close-in suburbs </p><p>and downtown.  So some commuters say they walk an hour to </p><p>the close-in suburbs, then wait up to 2 hours for a van </p><p>to the city.  For the evening trip home, the mood turns </p><p>more somber, with stoic and dejected commuters sitting </p><p>for hours in curbside lines.  Few converse. </p><p> </p><p>4. Commuters say the worst element is uncertainty.  A </p><p>worker who begins at 8:00am might be lucky to get a ride </p><p>at 5:00am, then arrive at her office at 5:30am with 2.5 </p><p>hours to kill.  The next morning she will retrace her </p><p>steps and not get a lift until 8:00am.  By the late- </p><p>morning or evening, vans solicit 3-5 times the normal </p><p>fare from increasingly desperate workers, who tell us </p><p>employers and supervisors from low-density suburbs are </p><p>either oblivious or unsympathetic to their transport </p><p>woes. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>5. Commuters from high-density areas now appear more </p><p>stunned than angry that their lifestyles have so rapidly </p><p>deteriorated.  This -- along with undernourishment and </p><p>sheer exhaustion -- may account for their seeming </p><p>acquiescence.  If the situation worsens, however, we </p><p>suspect that stoicism could give way to rage. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
