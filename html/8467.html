<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000960 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, EUR/NB, EAP/J; NSC FOR </p><p>E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:   DECL:  06-04-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, EAID, CE, NO, JA, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  In response to PM\'s latest letter, Tigers do </p><p>not budge from their demand for an interim structure </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo-Ops Center 06/04/03 telecon </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo-SA/INS 06/04/03 class e-mail </p><p>-      (C) Tokyo 3490 (Notal) </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 949, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons:  1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  In their June 4 reply to the prime </p><p>minister\'s latest letter, the Tigers have not budged </p><p>from their demand that an interim administration be </p><p>created for the north/east.  The group says it is </p><p>willing to discuss the issue, but only if the GSL takes </p><p>steps toward meeting this demand first.  While the Tiger </p><p>reply did not explicitly mention the upcoming Tokyo </p><p>donors conference, it seems that the group does not plan </p><p>to reconsider its prior decision not/not to attend.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) TIGER RESPONSE:  The Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have responded to Sri Lankan Prime </p><p>Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe\'s June 1 letter to the </p><p>group.  (Note:  In his June 1 letter, the PM reviewed </p><p>the GSL\'s latest proposal regarding assistance delivery </p><p>to the north/east, inviting the group to hold a "clear </p><p>the air"-type of meeting on the subject.  The PM\'s </p><p>letter, and that of the Tigers\' today, is part of a long </p><p>skein of communications focused on ways to get the </p><p>Tigers to return to the peace talks and to attend the </p><p>June 9-10 Tokyo donors conference -- See Reftels.)  In </p><p>their response, which was posted on the pro-LTTE website </p><p>"TamilNet" on June 4, LTTE chief negotiator Anton </p><p>Balasingham told the PM that the Tigers had no intention </p><p>of backing down from their demand for the creation of a </p><p>Tiger-controlled interim administration in the </p><p>north/east.  (Note:  Ref B contains the text of </p><p>Balasingham\'s letter to the PM.  The text did not </p><p>mention the Tokyo conference -- See Para 8.)  The </p><p>London-based Balasingham said the group was willing to </p><p>discuss these matters, but only if the GSL took steps </p><p>toward meeting the LTTE\'s demands first. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Explaining the LTTE\'s stance, Balasingham hit </p><p>out hard against the government\'s recent proposal </p><p>regarding assistance delivery, essentially telling the </p><p>government that it was missing the point.  Making clear </p><p>that the LTTE wants an interim arrangement with </p><p>political responsibilities (not only involving </p><p>assistance), Balasingham states: </p><p> </p><p>"At the outset, we wish to point out that we seriously </p><p>differ in perception with what the LTTE leadership </p><p>proposes and what your government offers.  While our </p><p>leadership has proposed an interim administrative </p><p>framework, a politico-administrative structure for the </p><p>northeast with wider participation of the LTTE, your </p><p>government has offered a council with a structure and </p><p>mechanism for development of the region." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Regarding the details of the GSL\'s proposal, </p><p>Balasingham criticizes it as being overly complex, </p><p>stating: </p><p> </p><p>"This is not the end of this strange evolutionary </p><p>history of your government\'s committees and structures. </p><p>You are now suggesting a new and comprehensive and </p><p>substantial dialogue to clarify and expand the new </p><p>structure and to specify and situate the role of the </p><p>LTTE in the envisaged model.  We could only speculate as </p><p>to how many rounds of negotiations the parties would </p><p>have to undergo to arrive at a final formulation of this </p><p>new bureaucratic institution."  (Note:  Observers have </p><p>also commented on the almost absurd complexity of the </p><p>GSL\'s proposal, which involves an "apex body," a </p><p>"special commissioner," and a "management board," among </p><p>many other wedding cake layers.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Balasingham goes on to get in a solid lick at </p><p>the expense of the international community (Read:  the </p><p>U.S., India, etc.), asserting that even if the GSL </p><p>proposal is agreed to by the LTTE, it is quite possible </p><p>it would be blocked.  He states:  "The new structure </p><p>would require the endorsement of the international </p><p>community in order to mobilize adequate resources for </p><p>the reconstruction of the northeast.  This endorsement </p><p>may not be forthcoming since some of the powerful </p><p>international and regional players are prejudiced </p><p>against us and continue to deny our hard-earned status </p><p>as the true representatives of the people." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Wrapping up, Balasingham starkly underscores </p><p>that the government\'s proposals are "unsatisfactory and </p><p>therefore unacceptable."  Balasingham stresses that the </p><p>only way forward is to form an interim structure in the </p><p>north/east with heavy LTTE involvement, given the fact </p><p>that the government is not strong enough in the south to </p><p>bring about a final political settlement at this time. </p><p>He closes: </p><p> </p><p>"In conclusion, we wish to assure you that we are </p><p>prepared to resume negotiations if you reconsider your </p><p>position and offer us, for our consideration, a draft </p><p>framework for an interim administrative structure along </p><p>the lines proposed by our leadership.  We hope that you </p><p>will consider our suggestion favorably." </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) REACTION:  Because the Tiger letter just came </p><p>out, there has been precious little local reaction to it </p><p>as of yet.  (Note:  Visiting Deputy USAID administrator </p><p>Frederick W. Schieck and Ambassador Wills are meeting </p><p>with PM Wickremesinghe late June 4 afternoon.  If the PM </p><p>has any comments on the situation in the aftermath of </p><p>Balasingham\'s letter, we will pass them on to the </p><p>Department.)  Before the letter was posted on the web, </p><p>however, there were widespread rumblings that the Tigers </p><p>were not going to sign on to the government\'s assistance </p><p>proposal re the north/east, nor agree to a "clear the </p><p>air" meeting.  Joseph Pararajasingham, a pro-LTTE Tamil </p><p>National Alliance MP, told us early June 4 (before the </p><p>letter came out) that the LTTE remained very angry </p><p>because the government did not seem to be taking the </p><p>LTTE\'s proposal for an interim structure in the </p><p>north/east "very seriously."  Under the circumstances, </p><p>Pararajasingham said he did not think the group was in </p><p>the mood to be cooperative and meet with the GSL. </p><p>Polchief stressed to Pararajasingham that the LTTE\'s </p><p>current approach was not helpful, and if the group had </p><p>real substantive concerns it made much more sense to </p><p>discuss them face-to-face with the government. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) NO MENTION OF TOKYO:  As with the LTTE\'s most </p><p>recent communications, Balasingham\'s letter did not </p><p>mention the Tokyo donors conference in any way, shape, </p><p>or form.  Again, before the letter came out, </p><p>Pararajasingham told polchief that he saw "little </p><p>chance" that the LTTE would be represented in Tokyo.  In </p><p>a conversation also held before the Tiger letter came </p><p>out, Ambassador Bernard Goonetilleke of the Peace </p><p>Secretariat told us that he doubted that it was </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>"programmatically possible" for the LTTE to attend at </p><p>this point.  While the GSL hoped the Tigers changed </p><p>their minds, Goonetilleke said it seemed that the LTTE </p><p>was letting the timeframe "slip away" when practical </p><p>arrangements could be made for sending a delegation to </p><p>Tokyo. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  Balasingham\'s letter was not rude per </p><p>se, but it was pointed and he certainly made clear where </p><p>the LTTE stands, i.e., progress must be made on the </p><p>LTTE\'s demands before the group will cooperate.  Given </p><p>the hard-line edginess of the LTTE at this point, it </p><p>makes it tough for the GSL to respond favorably, even </p><p>though the government does not reject eventual formation </p><p>of an interim structure in the north/east per se. </p><p>Whatever happens, the whole issue almost certainly needs </p><p>weeks/months to work out and not mere days, as the </p><p>Tigers appear to think. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) All that said, it is interesting that there was </p><p>no mention of Tokyo.  The letter gave no/no hint that </p><p>the LTTE will reconsider its plan not/not to attend, </p><p>however, and there really does not seem to be a silver </p><p>lining in the fact that Tokyo went unmentioned.  After </p><p>weeks of feverish GSL, Norwegian, and Japanese efforts </p><p>to get the Tigers to Tokyo, it appears that the string </p><p>is running out -- per the LTTE\'s choice.  END COMMENT. </p><p>11.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
