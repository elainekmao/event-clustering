<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 CARACAS 01552 </p><p> </p><p>FOR ARA ABRAMS; INR ABRAMOWITZ </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS NSC FOR SORZANO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, CU, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: CUBA AFTER CASTRO -- ARE WE READY? </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION:  THIS CABLE ASKS THE </p><p>QUESTION: "IS THE UNITED STATES PREPARED FOR A </p><p>SUDDEN CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT IN CUBA?"  IT DOES NOT </p><p>ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, NOR DOES IT </p><p>SPECULATE ON THE PROBABILITY OF SUCH AN EVENT. </p><p>IT ALSO DOES NOT PROPOSE COURSES OF ACTION DESIGNED </p><p>TO BRING THAT EVENT ABOUT.  IT DOES SUGGEST THE </p><p>USG ESTABLISH A STUDY GROUP TO CONSIDER OUR OPTIONS </p><p>IN SUCH AN EVENTUALITY, AS UNLIKELY AS IT MAY APPEAR </p><p>TO BE AT THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  ALTHOUGH "EXPERTS" HAVE BEEN PREDICTING CASTRO\'S </p><p>DOWNFALL FOR ABOUT 29 YEARS, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE </p><p>THAT HE WILL NOT LAST FOREVER.  IF IT IS TRUE THAT </p><p>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN CUBA ARE VERY BAD </p><p>AND CONTINUING TO DETERIORATE; IF RECENT HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES DEFECTORS ARE </p><p>INDICATIVE OF A COLLAPSE OF THE "NOMENKLATURA"; </p><p>IF CASTRO\'S AGE BEGINS TO TAKE ITS TOLL, COULD WE </p><p>BE SEEING THE BEGINNING OF THE END?  MAYBE NOT, BUT, </p><p>IF SO, ARE WE READY TO SEIZE WHAT MAY BE A FLEETING </p><p>OPPORTUNITY BROUGHT ABOUT, FOR EXAMPLE, BY A MILITARY </p><p>COUP, AS FAR-FETCHED AS THAT IDEA SEEMS RIGHT NOW? </p><p>IT COULD BE A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT TO STUDY OUR </p><p>OPTIONS, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, THE QUESTION OF </p><p>WHAT COULD BE CALLED THE "DENAZIFICATION" OF CUBA. </p><p>THE U.S. HAS HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH "EXORCISING" </p><p>OTHER SOCIETIES OF MILITARIZED, HATE-FILLED </p><p>IDEOLOGIES WHICH MAINTAINED THEMSELVES IN POWER </p><p>BY TERROR AND BRUTALITY.  HAVE WE EXAMINED, ON THE </p><p>ONE HAND, THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN </p><p>NAZI GERMANY, FASCIST ITALY AND JAPAN, AND CUBA ON </p><p>THE OTHER?  IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE AND CERTAINLY </p><p>MORE THAN SIMPLY AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE.  STRANGER </p><p>THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN HISTORY, THAT A TYRANNY </p><p>SUDDENLY CEASES TO EXIST, DUE TO INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL </p><p>CAUSES.  IF THAT HAPPENS  IN CUBA, ARE WE PREPARED TO </p><p>WORK QUICKLY WITH WHATEVER CUBANS INSIDE THE ISLAND </p><p>MAY BE WILLING TO DETACH HER FROM THE SOVIET BLOC BEFORE </p><p>HARD-LINE COMMUNISTS AND CASTROITES CAN SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>REACT? IF WE ARE, CAN WE SUSTAIN THE EFFORT BY </p><p>BEGINNING A PROCESS OF UNDOING NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF </p><p>BRAIN-WASHING AND PROPAGANDA? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  WE COULD EXAMINE OUR EXPERIENCE  IN A MINOR </p><p>BUT MORE RECENT AND STILL RELEVANT CASE:  GRENADA. </p><p>WERE WE READY FOR A SUDDEN CHANGE IN GRENADA IN </p><p>1983?  ALTHOUGH THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DIFFERENT, </p><p>DID WE MAKE OUR TASK EASIER OR MORE DIFFICULT BY </p><p>OUR ADVANCE PLANS OR LACK THEREOF? </p><p>WHAT WAS OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AND </p><p>MONTHS AFTER THE RESCUE MISSION?  HOW WOULD IT HAVE </p><p>WORKED IN THE CASE OF A SPANISH-SPEAKING COUNTRY WITH </p><p>30 YEARS OF COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP INSTEAD OF 4 YEARS? </p><p>ALTHOUGH AN INVASION OR OCCUPATION OF CUBA BY U.S. </p><p>FORCES IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY, IT COULD BE THAT, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, UNDER A SCENARIO OF A SUCCESSFUL COUP BY </p><p>CUBAN MILITARY OFFICERS FOLLOWING, LET\'S SAY A CASTRO </p><p>HEART ATTACK, THAT THE PROVISIONAL CUBAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD ASK THE USG FOR ALL TYPES OF </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  IF WE ARE NOT READY TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY, </p><p>A COUNTER-COUP COULD BE LAUNCHED. THE FATE OF CUBA </p><p>FOR ANOTHER 30 YEARS COULD THUS BE DECIDED IN A </p><p>MATTER OF HOURS, WITH THE CORRESPONDING CONSEQUENCES </p><p>FOR U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY.  HOW MUCH HAS A COMMUNIST </p><p>BASE NINETY MILES FROM FLORIDA COST US IN THE PAST </p><p>THREE DECADES?  EVEN IF THERE IS NO VIOLENT </p><p>RESISTANCE TO THE "NEW" CUBAN GOVERNMENT, ARE WE </p><p>PREPARED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC (E.G., FOOD, </p><p>OIL) AND OTHER HELP WHICH THE NEW GOVERNMENT--ASSUMING, </p><p>OF COURSE, THAT IT IS PRN-US--SEEKS? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  A WASHINGTON-BASED TASK FORCE OR STUDY GROUP </p><p>CONSISTING OF THE PRINCIPAL USG AGENCIES WITH </p><p>KNOWLEDGE OF CUBA, AUGMENTED BY CONSULTANTS </p><p>INCLUDING TRUSTWORTHY CUBANS AND AMERICANS SUCH </p><p>AS LONG-TIME EXILES, RECENT DEFECTORS, ACADEMICS, AND </p><p>PERSONS FAMILIAR WITH ISSUES SUCH AS "DE NAZIFICATION" </p><p>IN POST WWII GERMANY, COULD PREPARE AN ACTION </p><p>PLAN WHICH COULD SAVE THE UNITED STATES MUCH </p><p>COST AND SUFFERING IN THE EVENTUALITY OF A SUDDEN </p><p>CHANGE IN CUBA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REICH </p><p></p></div>
