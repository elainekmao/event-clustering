<p>UNCLAS KUWAIT 001199 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SOCI, PREL, IZ, KU </p><p>SUBJECT: SADDAM\'S SECRET WEAPON: THE MIGHTY MENGASH! </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: The forced landing of a U.S. Apache attack </p><p>helicopter behind Iraqi lines in the early days of the war, </p><p>and the resulting implausible Iraqi claims that a heroic </p><p>farmer named Mengash was responsible, have spawned a cottage </p><p>industry of derision in Kuwait.  Today\'s date (April 01), and </p><p>Kuwaitis\' addiction to mobile-phone text messages, helped </p><p>turn the stream of jokes into a torrent.  The mocking of this </p><p>exaggerated Iraqi peasant hero is perhaps the most satisfying </p><p>way the Kuwaitis have found to respond to their growing </p><p>isolation in the Arab world, letting them vent their anger at </p><p>the hostile Arab \'street\' without losing their cool.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Those familiar with Kuwait are used to hearing the </p><p>incessant tones of incoming cellular phone calls and beeps of </p><p>newly received text messages.  Along with those beeps these </p><p>days, however, one is liable to hear the accompanying </p><p>laughter of Kuwaitis who have just received the latest </p><p>Mengash joke. </p><p> </p><p>3. Baghdad\'s rustic hero is sarcastically "credited" with </p><p>everything from fending off anthrax to shooting down the </p><p>space shuttle Columbia.  While we have yet to see Mengash </p><p>T-shirts on the streets, the phrase "I (heart) Mengash" has </p><p>already flashed across the screens of mobile phones </p><p>throughout the country and been printed in newspapers.  Why </p><p>did the latest missile attack on Kuwait fail?  It was </p><p>Mengash, joke the Kuwaitis, who mistook an outbound missile </p><p>for an inbound one and shot it out of the sky, such is his </p><p>skill!  He is the equal of ten Republican Guard Divisions and </p><p>an invincible leader!  He is so awesome, he even shot down an </p><p>American submarine!  The Iraqis should clone him!  In fact, </p><p>it\'s already being done!  Saddam started pumping money into a </p><p>cloning program to save his battered regime as soon as </p><p>Mengash performed his heroic feat.  Indeed, with his WWI era </p><p>rifle and a steady aim, Mengash is the source of all Iraqi </p><p>military victories, at least in the Kuwaiti telling. </p><p> </p><p>4. In Mengash, the Kuwaitis have found the perfect </p><p>psychological antidote to the Iraqi regime\'s over-the-top </p><p>propaganda.  While the rest of the Arab world swallows the </p><p>noxious brew, Kuwaitis, who recognize it for what it is, no </p><p>longer have to seethe, they can laugh it off. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
