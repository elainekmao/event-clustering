<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000146 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INR/R/MR AND AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION U.S./AFRICA TRADE; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "U. S. should treat Africa as single </p><p>      entity" the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" </p><p>      dedicated its January 19 editorial to cautioning the United </p><p>      States against the promotion of selective trade agreements, </p><p>      warning that such agreements "have the potential to divide </p><p>      Africa."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The United States and five Southern African Customs </p><p>      Union (SACU) members, last Monday agreed to start </p><p>      negotiating a free trade agreement (FTA), which is designed </p><p>      to lower trade barriers, open markets and stimulate </p><p>      economic growth and development.  U. S. trade </p><p>      representative, Robert Zoellick, said the FTA between his </p><p>      country and the five SACU countries "will provide new </p><p>      opportunities for the peoples of all our countries, and </p><p>      will particularly provide a boost to regional growth, </p><p>      development and prosperity.\'  SACY, which comprises </p><p>      Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland, </p><p>      will no doubt benefit quite significantly from the </p><p>      increased access to U. S. markets.  But, as pointed out by </p><p>      the secretary-general of the Common Market of East and </p><p>      Southern Africa (COMESA), Erasmus Mwencha, such </p><p>      negotiations have the potential to divide Africa and reduce </p><p>      its ability to negotiate in future trade deals. . .Indeed, </p><p>      such selective trade agreements do not fall in the way of </p><p>      closer economic integration at the continental level, and </p><p>      serve to put wedges and schisms in between individual </p><p>      African countries and regional blocs, as they strive to win </p><p>      favorable, exclusive concessions from powerful, rich </p><p>      countries." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
