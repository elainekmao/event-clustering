(C) ON FEBRUARY 13 NICHOLAS NCUBE, PERMANENT </p><p>SECRETARY - MINISTRY OF FINANCE, PAID A CALL ON US AT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OUR INVITATION TO DISCUSS ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS, AND THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  WE KNOW </p><p>NCUBE WELL, AS HE HAS BEEN A DEPENDABLE AND SOLID </p><p>EMBASSY INTERLOCUTOR FOR OVER A DECADE THROUGHOUT HIS </p><p>STRING OF GOVERNMENT POSITIONS.  IN THIS VEIN NCUBE </p><p>SAT DOWN AND ASKED, "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF US?"  CHARGE </p><p>INFORMED HIM FRANKLY AND DIRECTLY OF THE VERY SERIOUS </p><p>CONCERNS WE HAVE FOR THE MULTITUDE OF NEGATIVE </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING WITH DIRECT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT </p><p>AND BACKING.  WE ADVISED HIM THAT TOLERANCE THRESHOLDS </p><p>ARE BEING OVERWHELMED, AND THAT SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS </p><p>ON THE JUDICIARY, THE INDEPENDENT PRESS AND THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY ARE CAUSING SEVERE </p><p>DAMAGE TO ZIMBABWE\'S STANDING AND NATIONAL CHARACTER. </p><p>NCUBE TOOK OUR MESSAGE IN WITH LITTLE OR NO REBUTTAL </p><p>AND ADMITTED THAT HIS COUNTRY HAS EXCEEDINGLY GOOD AIM </p><p>WHEN IT COMES TO SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00750  141406Z </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON THE FINANCE MINISTRY\'S OPERATIONS AND </p><p>DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS NCUBE, TO OUR </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT, FED US A STRAIGHTFORWARD VERSION OF </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT LINE.  HE BOASTED THAT GOZ JANUARY </p><p>RECEIPTS WERE ABOVE BUDGET, PARTIALLY DUE TO THE VERY </p><p>HEFTY FEE INCREASES THEY HAVE BEEN PUSHING ACROSS THE </p><p>BOARD (FROM SPEEDING TICKETS TO BIRTH CERTIFICATE FEES </p><p>TO PHOTOCOPIES FOR THE PUBLIC).  HE FURTHER CLAIMED </p><p>THAT TOTAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING WAS "GOOD", AND EVEN </p><p>PROCLAIMED THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTRY WAS WITHIN ITS </p><p>BUDGET, DESPITE THE 50 PERCENT CUT (IN REAL TERMS) IT </p><p>SUFFERED IN THE 2001 BUDGET (REFTEL).  HOW THIS COULD </p><p>BE THE CASE, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE ADDITIONAL </p><p>TROOPS SENT TO THE CONGO AFTER THE KABILA </p><p>ASSASSINATION, WAS NOT FORTHCOMING FROM THE PERMSEC. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) HE ADMITTED TO DIFFICULTIES IN CARRYING OUT </p><p>PRIVATIZATION, CITING AS AN EXAMPLE THE PROCLAIMED </p><p>INABILITY OF THE RESPONSIBLE MINISTRY (READ </p><p>AGRICULTURE) TO FIND THE SHARE CERTIFICATES NEEDED TO </p><p>SELL OFF THE GOZ\'S MAJORITY STAKE IN COTTCO (A </p><p>PARTIALLY-PRIVATIZED PARASTATAL INVOLVED IN COTTON </p><p>PRODUCTION AND SALES).  HE LAMENTED THAT THE STOCK </p><p>MARKET PRICE WAS DROPPING OF LATE, AND JOKED THAT HE </p><p>HAD THREATENED TO MAKE UP ANY LOSSES CAUSED BY THE </p><p>DELAY FROM THE MINISTRY\'S OWN BUDGET.  NCUBE ALSO TOLD </p><p>US THAT THE NEW CASH PAYMENT SYSTEM INSTALLATION </p><p>(DESIGNED TO PREVENT MINISTRIES FROM SPENDING MORE </p><p>THAN THEIR BUDGET ALLOCATION) WAS GOING WELL, WITH </p><p>EDUCATION, AGRICULTURE, FINANCE AND THE CENTRAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00750  141406Z </p><p>PAYMENTS OFFICE ALREADY ONLINE.  COMING UP NEXT WAS </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENSE AND THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE. </p><p>THE FINANCE MINISTRY PLACES GREAT FAITH IN THE ABILITY </p><p>OF THE SYSTEM TO CONTROL OVERSPENDING, THOUGH WE WILL </p><p>RESERVE OUR JUDGMENT UNTIL WE SEE WHAT COMES OF WELL- </p><p>CONNECTED MINISTERS\' VISITS TO THE PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE, </p><p>TO PLEA FOR THAT SPECIAL, EXTRA, ONE-TIME-ONLY </p><p>ALLOCATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: NCUBE LISTENED CLOSELY AND WE HAVE NO </p><p>DOUBT THAT HE WILL COMMUNICATE OUR MESSAGE BOTH TO </p><p>MANAGEMENT AT HIS MINISTRY AND TO THE ORAL NETWORK OF </p><p>HIS GOVERNMENT COLLEAGUES.  HIS BLASE PRESENTATION OF </p><p>WHAT CAN ONLY BE CHARITABLY DESCRIBED AS HALF-TRUTHS </p><p>WAS A LETDOWN, BUT IT MIMICKED WHAT HIS BOSS, SIMBA </p><p>MAKONI, HAD DONE DURING HIS RECENT WASHINGTON VISIT. </p><p>WE WILL KEEP THE CHANNELS OPEN, AND WILL ONLY BELIEVE </p><p>FISCAL CONTROL SUCCESS WHEN WE SEE IT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
