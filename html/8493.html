<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000492 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, SOCI, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: NAM CAM TRIAL IN FINAL STAGES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HCMC 00189 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Convening after a 10-day recess that capped a trial which </p><p>ran from February 25 - May 24, the People\'s Court of Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City gathered June 4 to read the results of the case </p><p>investigations and the verdicts for the 155 defendants in the </p><p>trial of the underworld kingpin Truong Van Cam (a.k.a. Nam Cam). </p><p>As expected, all 155 defendants were found guilty.  Their </p><p>sentences will be delivered June 5 at 2:00 pm. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Post\'s repeated requests to gain access to the courtroom </p><p>or the press gallery to listen to the verdicts were denied, with </p><p>the External Relations Office (local branch of the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs) citing space limitations.  ConGenoffs were </p><p>permitted to enter a large courtyard outside the courthouse, </p><p>where hundreds of family members and onlookers gathered to listen </p><p>to the proceedings, broadcast by speaker from the courtroom. </p><p>People spoke in hushed tones, becoming still at the crucial </p><p>moment when the verdict for their family member was read or when </p><p>unexpected information was introduced from the case </p><p>investigations. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) At precisely 4:00 pm on June 4, a bell rang inside the </p><p>courtroom concluding the day\'s events.  After several people </p><p>filed out of the building, a crowd of around 30 police gathered </p><p>at the top of the steps to the courthouse, while about 30 more </p><p>flanked the perimeter fences keeping the crowds back and the </p><p>parking area clear.  A parade of trucks and armored vehicles, </p><p>escorted by roughly 40 traffic police and numerous riot police, </p><p>arrived to take the defendants back to prison.  The 155 prisoners </p><p>emerged, dressed in white and green striped uniforms, each with </p><p>an attendant police officer, and descended the courthouse steps </p><p>to the vehicles.  Members of the crowd called out to their </p><p>parents, siblings and children.  Nam Cam emerged, gaunt, gray- </p><p>haired, but smiling, to shouts and applause from the crowd, which </p><p>accorded him celebrity status.  Slowly the trucks started up, </p><p>turned on their sirens, and carried their cargo away. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Circulating among the members of the crowd and </p><p>listening to the proceedings, ConGenoffs perceived mixed feelings </p><p>about the trial and its outcome.  On the one hand, the trial </p><p>received broad local and some international media coverage, and </p><p>the proceedings were broadcast to the public in the courtyard and </p><p>will be televised during the reading of the sentences tomorrow. </p><p>One young lawyer said that the case gave him new hope for the </p><p>future of law and litigation in Vietnam.  For the first time, he </p><p>explained, the defense attorneys for the defendants in this case </p><p>were allowed to meet their clients prior to the trial, had access </p><p>to the statements that were collected during the case </p><p>investigations, and were able to present arguments in court that </p><p>were critical of the government\'s handling of the case and its </p><p>interpretation of the law. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) On the other hand, during a case investigation that was </p><p>read today, the court said it had to consider the patriotic </p><p>revolutionary past of the defendant\'s father as bearing weight in </p><p>determining the defendant\'s sentence.  Local newspapers also ran </p><p>several articles criticizing the defense attorneys for saying the </p><p>government had used illegal methods to conduct their </p><p>investigations. (Note: The Hanoi Bar Association reportedly spoke </p><p>out to defend these attorneys. End note.)  Finally, the verdicts </p><p>read by the court cited only the information revealed in the </p><p>investigation prior to the trial, not the arguments or facts put </p><p>forward during the trial by the defense attorneys. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) There is general agreement that the trial is important, </p><p>but mixed feelings about its wider implications for fighting </p><p>corruption.  One spectator, who lives in Nam Cam\'s neighborhood, </p><p>said he had considered him a "humanitarian," helping poor people </p><p>by providing coffins for their deceased relatives.  But he also </p><p>said that when he learned of the horrible things that Nam Cam had </p><p>done, he wanted to see justice served.  Another spectator said he </p><p>came to the courthouse to hear the verdict and sentence because </p><p>he didn\'t trust what might be printed in the newspapers.  Several </p><p>members of the crowd echoed this sentiment, adding they wanted to </p><p>be there at this moment in history, when justice was served in </p><p>Vietnam and even policemen and government officials were called </p><p>to account.  ConGenoffs will report on the trial in greater </p><p>detail after its conclusion. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
