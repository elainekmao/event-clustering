<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 ANKARA 008717 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OSD FOR DASD BRZEZINSKI AND CAPT WILKINS; DSCA FOR J. </p><p>FARMER AND LT. COL BUCHHOLTZ; STATE FOR EUR/SE AND PM/RSAT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, MARR, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: US-TURKEY HIGH-LEVEL DEFENSE GROUP MEETING FOLLOW </p><p>UP:  REQUEST TO CLOSE OUT PENDING ACTION ITEMS BEFORE </p><p>DECEMBER 16-18 WORKING GROUP MEETINGS. </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 6286 B) ANKARA 5767 C)ANKARA 3828 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On April 16-17, the USG and GOT convened the 17th </p><p>annual US-Turkey High-Level Defense Group (HLDG) meeting in </p><p>Istanbul.  The HLDG\'s two working groups--the </p><p>Political-Military Working Group (PMWG) and the Security </p><p>Assistance Work Group (SAWG)-- agreed on a number of action </p><p>items (ref c).  Since the 17th HLDG meeting, the USG has </p><p>initiated and, in some instances, completed action on a </p><p>number of items.  In early September, the USG submitted its </p><p>first quarterly written status report to the Turkish General </p><p>Staff (TGS) and the MFA (refs a-b). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) In October 2002, OSD and TGS agreed to convene </p><p>PMWG/SAWG meetings December 16-18 in Garmisch, Germany.  The </p><p>primary purpose of the PMWG/SAWG meetings will be to exchange </p><p>views on pol-mil/security assistance-related issues, review </p><p>the status of the action items from the 17th HLDG meeting, </p><p>and discuss the agenda for the 18th HLDG meeting in the US in </p><p>2003.  OSD DASD Brzezinski and TGS Deputy J5 for Agreements </p><p>MG Acar will co-chair the PMWG; DSCA Director for European </p><p>Affairs Jeanne Farmer and TGS Deputy J5 BG Dumanli will </p><p>co-chair the SAWG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>ACTION REQUEST </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Embassy/ODC recommend that the USG present its second </p><p>quarterly written status report to TGS at the December 16-18 </p><p>PMWG/SAWG meetings.  The more action items we can cross off </p><p>our list prior to the PMWG/SAWG meetings, the more persuasive </p><p>we will be in demonstrating to TGS leadership (which </p><p>questioned our commitment to the HLDG since the last HLDG </p><p>meeting in Istanbul) that we attach great importance to the </p><p>US-Turkish bilateral military relationship and the HLDG as a </p><p>forum to discuss issues of mutual concern to both countries. </p><p>Embassy/ODC therefore recommend that DOD, in coordination </p><p>with other agencies, complete action on as many of the </p><p>outstanding PMWG/SAWG action items listed in para 5 as </p><p>possible.  The Embassy recognizes that there may be some </p><p>instances where Washington may have taken action on issues </p><p>since the USG submitted its first quarterly status report in </p><p>September.  In these instances, Embassy/ODC would appreciate </p><p>any updated information that will assist us in drafting the </p><p>second quarterly action items status report.  Embassy/ODC </p><p>intends to submit for Washington\'s review a text of the </p><p>second quarterly report in early December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>OUTSTANDING PMWG/SAWG ACTION ITEMS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Below is a list of the outstanding action items from </p><p>the PMWG/SAWG that Embassy/ODC believe require action prior </p><p>to the PMWG/SAWG meetings.  There are other action items that </p><p>are technically "outstanding" (i.e. facilitate smooth ISAF II </p><p>to ISAF III transition) but where the USG has and will </p><p>continue to take action well beyond the December meetings. </p><p>We have elected not to focus on these items here, but intend </p><p>to record the actions taken the by USG in our second </p><p>quarterly status report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Outstanding Political-Military Working Group Action Items </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 2:  In order to complete the Space Cooperation </p><p>MOU prior to MOU negotiations the Statement of Intent between </p><p>the US and Turkish General Staff will be signed by the proper </p><p>authorities at the level of US Assistant Secretary of Defense </p><p>and Commander of the Turkish Air Force (TUAF). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation:  DOD and TUAF signed the Statement of Intent </p><p>on July 12, 2002.  Embassy/ODC understand that DOD </p><p>subsequently initiated the inter-agency review/approval </p><p>process to grant OSD permission to enter into MOU </p><p>negotiations with the GOT, and that process is still </p><p>underway.  Embassy/ODC recommend that appropriate Washington </p><p>agencies complete the review process and authorize DOD </p><p>(preferably prior to the PMWG December 16-18 meeting) to </p><p>begin MOU negotiations with the GOT. </p><p>Action Item 3: For space training courses, the US will </p><p>investigate ways to find financing solutions (e.g. IMET, FMS). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation:  During a November 20 meeting with visiting </p><p>DSCA\'s Lt. Gen. Walters, the Turkish Air Force (TUAF) </p><p>delivered a brief titled "Topics of Special Importance to the </p><p>Turkish Air Force."  One of the items on the list was Space </p><p>Training.  TUAF BG Yilmaz requested that the USG respond to </p><p>TUAF\'s request to receive the 45-day training course </p><p>(150C-200T) and also agree to provide military (as opposed to </p><p>civilian contractor-provided) courses to Turkish officers. </p><p>BG Yilmaz said that TUAF would raise the issue again at the </p><p>PMWG meeting in December.  Embassy/ODC recommend that OSD and </p><p>other appropriate USG agencies complete their review of </p><p>TUAF\'s request and, if possible, deliver a favorable response </p><p>to the TUAF at the PMWG meeting in December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 4:  The USG will provide a briefing on the way </p><p>ahead for the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and Operation </p><p>Enduring Freedom (OEF). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation:  While the USG provided GOT civilian and </p><p>military officials a number of briefings on the GWOT and OEF </p><p>earlier this year (ref c), Embassy recommends that the USG </p><p>provide the PMWG an updated briefing in December (with a </p><p>recommendation for a power-point presentation) on our current </p><p>GWOT/OEF activites as well as our current thinking for future </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 5: Bilateral Working Groups (Partnership in Space </p><p>Cooperation, Technical Experts Group, and the Caucasus </p><p>Working Group) will meet separately and report to the </p><p>HLDG/PMWG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation:  Embassy understands that all of the </p><p>bilateral working groups have met since the HLDG meeting in </p><p>April.  Embassy recommends that all three working groups </p><p>brief the PMWG in December on the results of these meetings </p><p>and outline future activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Outstanding Security Assistance Working Group (SAWG) Action </p><p>Items </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 1: The US agreed to look into the status of </p><p>Turkey\'s third-country transfer requests of US-origin </p><p>equipment to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Pakistan and report back </p><p>to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation: Embassy/ODC recommend that the State </p><p>Department, in conjunction with other appropriate agencies, </p><p>complete review of the GOT\'s requests and provide GOT </p><p>officials responses by NLT than the PMWG meeting.  If </p><p>Washington requires additional information from the GOT in </p><p>order to process the requests, we ask that Washington provide </p><p>us the details prior to the December meetings and the Embassy </p><p>will forward them to the GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 2: Turkey agreed to provide the US a list of open </p><p>third-country transfer requests and to encourage other </p><p>countries to sign the "blanket assurance" agreements with the </p><p>US. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Taken: Embassy/ODC have not received such a list, but </p><p>understand that DSCA and/or the State Department (PM/RSAT) </p><p>may have received one.  If Washington agencies have received </p><p>such a list, we recommend that Washington initiate (and where </p><p>possible complete) the inter-agency review process in time </p><p>for the SAWG meeting and inform the Embassy of any action </p><p>taken so it can be included in the second written quarterly </p><p>status report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 3: Turkey and the US agreed that issues related </p><p>to potential joint research and development and co-production </p><p>opportunities should be discussed at the Defense Industrial </p><p>Cooperation (DIC) Meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation:  Embassy/ODC believe this action item has </p><p>been overtaken by events.  On November 11, 2002, ODC received </p><p>a letter from TGS J5 Lt. Gen. Turgut advising that, as a </p><p>result of an inter-governmental study (including TGS and </p><p>MND), the GOT has decided to cancel the Turkish-US Defense </p><p>Industrial Cooperation (DIC) and fold discussion of </p><p>DIC-related issues into the HLDG\'s SAWG.  Given that the DIC </p><p>has not met since March 1998, and senior MND leadership have </p><p>resisted USG efforts to convene a meeting (they do not </p><p>believe it is necessary), we concur with TGS\'s decision and </p><p>recommend that Washington endorse it.  In our view, folding </p><p>DIC issues into the SAWG (which is controlled by TGS) offers </p><p>us the best chance to make progress on DIC-related issues. </p><p>If Washington concurs, we recommend that Washington agencies </p><p>come to the SAWG with a list of possible DIC-related areas of </p><p>cooperation to present to TGS to demonstrate our commitment </p><p>to furthering US-GOT defense industrial cooperation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 4: Turkey expressed a desire for the USG to </p><p>continue to review Ankara\'s request to forgive FMS debts and </p><p>interest due. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation:  This issue remains a top TGS priority. </p><p>Discussion of the issue within MFA and military circles has </p><p>increased recently as a result of press reports that the USG </p><p>is considering providing Turkey a large assistance package. </p><p>Embassy/ODC understand the difficulties associated with debt </p><p>forgiveness.  We also understand that the larger issue of </p><p>assistance to Turkey is being discussed in other fora.  That </p><p>said, we do not believe the USG can unilaterally drop the </p><p>issue of FMF debt relief from the HLDG agenda.   The key here </p><p>is to be honest and upfront with the Turks about the </p><p>possibility of debt relief.  Therefore, we recommend that </p><p>during the SAWG meeting in December, the USG brief TGS on our </p><p>current thinking on the possibility of providing Turkey debt </p><p>relief and inform them that assistance for Turkey in general </p><p>is being discussed in other fora. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 6:  The US will update Turkey on AEW&C Source </p><p>Code availability as soon as the USAF completes the </p><p>evaluation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation:  This is a high-priority and front-burner </p><p>issue for TUAF and TGS.  Senior TUAF officers most recently </p><p>raised this issue with Lt. Gen. Walters during his November </p><p>19-22 visit to Ankara.  Embassy/ODC understand Washington is </p><p>reviewing Boeing\'s request to reconsider some of the provisos </p><p>placed on its export license, and that the review process is </p><p>not likely to be complete until after December 4 -- the date </p><p>of contract effectivity for the AEW&C.  While TGS and TUAF </p><p>have told us they can "slightly" extend the contract </p><p>effectivity date while the USG completes its review (we </p><p>expect the same holds true for Boeing), they asked that the </p><p>USG complete its review and notify the GOT of the results as </p><p>soon as possible.  Embassy/ODC therefore recommend that the </p><p>relevant Washington agencies complete their review advise the </p><p>Turks of the decision, if possible before December 4, but NLT </p><p>the SAWG meeting in December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 7: The US will continue to monitor the status of </p><p>the EX-IM Bank Helicopter Guarantee Facility (HGF) loan </p><p>request for SEA Hawk Helicopters project and provide support </p><p>where possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation:  This issue continues to be one of TGS\'s </p><p>highest priorities (and the number one priority for the </p><p>Turkish Navy).  TGS CHOD Ozkok raised it during his November </p><p>5 meetings in Washington.  Embassy/ODC understand that </p><p>Washington has not re-engaged Congress on this issue since </p><p>Congress expressed its opposition to an extension some months </p><p>ago.  Sikorsky\'s President/CEO recently told DCM that </p><p>Sikorsky did not have alternative financing ideas.  He </p><p>expressed hope that, if the EX-IM HGF program could not be </p><p>extended, terms (especially the high exposure fee) of the </p><p>Defense Excess Loan Guarantee (DELG) program could be eased. </p><p>From our vantage point, we see two options: (1) re-engage </p><p>relevant members of Congress and make the case for an </p><p>extension or (2) not press for an extension, let the issue </p><p>die and examine alternative financing mechanisms to assist </p><p>the Turks acquire the helicopters.   In our view, maintaining </p><p>the current position -- "DOD supports an extension" -- is not </p><p>sustainable and in many ways is misleading the Turks.  We </p><p>understand that the extension of the HGF is one of the issues </p><p>that is under consideration as part of a larger assistance </p><p>package to Turkey.  We therefore recommend that Washington </p><p>agencies reach a consensus position on whether the </p><p>Administration intends to press for an extension of the HGF </p><p>and brief the Turks on our position during the PMWG/SAWG </p><p>meetings in December. </p><p>Action Item 10: The US agreed to provide status updates of </p><p>export license requests on specific licenses when requested </p><p>by the Turkish Embassy in Washington. </p><p>Action Taken: Embassy/ODC is not aware of specific requests </p><p>made by the Turkish Embassy in Washington.  That said, we </p><p>know TUAF, MFA and TGS are concerned about the status of </p><p>Washington\'s review of Boeing\'s request for proviso waivers </p><p>on its export license for the AEW&C program.  We therefore </p><p>recommend that Washington agencies provide the Turkish </p><p>Embassy in Washington regular updates on the inter-agency </p><p>review related to the AEW&C program, as well as respond to </p><p>any other outstanding requests from the Turkish Embassy that </p><p>may exist. </p><p>Action Item 11: The US agreed to investigate further to </p><p>determine the best forum for the C4ISR system, software radio </p><p>development and frequency management projects and inform </p><p>Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation: Embassy/ODC are unaware of any action taken </p><p>on this issue.  We recommend that the appropriate Washington </p><p>agencies undertake the necessary review and, if possible, </p><p>provide the GOT a formal response NLT the SAWG meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 14:  The US recognizes late apportionment of IMET </p><p>funds results in cancellation and loss of courses in January </p><p>and February and will make every effort to provide funding in </p><p>a timely manner.  This process is largely impacted </p><p>by the USG budget process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation:  Embassy/ODC recommend that Washington brief </p><p>the Turks at the SAWG meeting on the IMET funding and </p><p>disbursement process, including those factors that may impact </p><p>the timing of the disbursement of IMET funding.  We also </p><p>recommend that Washington explain to TGS the reason for any </p><p>delays that we may envision and, where possible, any steps </p><p>the USG intends to take to expedite the delivery of IMET </p><p>funding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 15:  For the pilot exchange program, a reply is </p><p>expected from the USG about the revised GOT proposal on UH-60 </p><p>utility helicopter pilot exchange program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation:  In our first quarterly written report, we </p><p>advised the GOT that the USG intended to provide the GOT a </p><p>response to its revised proposal on UH-60 utility helicopter </p><p>by September/October 2002.  It is our understanding that the </p><p>USG has not yet provided a response.  We recommend that the </p><p>USG provide the Turks a response NLT the SAWG meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 16:  The following HLDG will be hosted by the US </p><p>next year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation: Embassy/ODC understand that OSD intends to </p><p>host the 18th HLDG meeting in the US in spring 2003.  We </p><p>recommend that OSD deliver at the December 16-18 PMWG/SAWG </p><p>meetings a formal invitation from ASD Crouch to TGS D/CHOD </p><p>Gen Buyukanit (with a specific date and venue to be determine </p><p>later) offering to host the 18th HLDG in the US in spring </p><p>2003.  We believe that such a gesture will demonstrate the </p><p>importance we attach to the HLDG and our intention to follow </p><p>through on our commitment to host the 18th HLDG meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Item 17:  Turkey and the US agreed to provide a </p><p>quarterly written update (on the status of the action items). </p><p> The two sides agreed to meet in six months for another </p><p>update and discussion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recommendation:  Embassy/ODC recommend that the USG side </p><p>provide its second quarterly written update at the PMWG/SAWG </p><p>meeting in December. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
