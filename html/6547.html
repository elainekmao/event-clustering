<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ACCRA 000559 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, GH </p><p>SUBJECT: GHANA CHOOSES PUBLIC SILENCE ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 71798 (NODIS) </p><p> </p><p>     B. STATE 70678 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Mary C. Yates, reason 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  Ambassador Yates delivered reftel B demarche on </p><p>possible NAM involvement in a UNGA Special Session on Iraq to </p><p>Foreign Minister Hackman Owusu-Agyemang on March 19. </p><p>Ambassador stressed the counterproductive nature of any such </p><p>session while the Security Council remains seized with the </p><p>issue, and that the USG and its coalition partners had </p><p>sufficient legal authority to disarm Iraq under several </p><p>Security Council resolutions.  The Minister replied that </p><p>Ghana was, "off the record," in sympathy with the USG on </p><p>Iraq.  Given what he termed "national politics" and the </p><p>tremendous pressure the GOG was under from various sources, </p><p>NAM, Africa Group and others to oppose any intervention in </p><p>Iraq, the GOG would not make any public statement on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Owusu-Agyemang noted the confusion in the local media </p><p>over a false report of a call from the Presidency to the </p><p>White House expressing support for USG actions to disarm </p><p>Iraq.  There had been no such phone call made, he said. </p><p>Additionally, in violation of the GOG\'s decision to remain </p><p>silent publicly on Iraq, statements by a Presidency press </p><p>spokesman stating that more time should have been given to UN </p><p>inspectors had been repudiated by the Chief of Staff in later </p><p>remarks to the press, he noted.  Owusu-Agyemang said that the </p><p>local "anti-war machinery" was in "overdrive," and his </p><p>government had to exercise caution.  However, in regard to </p><p>any public demonstration that might threaten or impinge upon </p><p>Mission activities (none are planned that this Mission is </p><p>aware of), "it would be well contained." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Ambassador also delivered reftel A demarche on Iraqi </p><p>agents to the Foreign Minister, who pledged to communicate </p><p>our concerns to GOG security forces "immediately."  The </p><p>Ambassador thanked the Minister for the fine level of </p><p>cooperation on security matters.  The Minister concluded by </p><p>saying, "we recognize the depth of conviction of the United </p><p>States on Iraq," and reaffirmed the GOG\'s cooperation on </p><p>security matters.  He said he would be briefing the President </p><p>this afternoon on the details of these demarches. </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
