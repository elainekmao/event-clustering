<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 000173 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), IO/UNP </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN/MESSAGE NO. 006/02 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: PREL, VT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: SANT\'EGIDIO WANTS VOTE ON ITS ECOSOC CANDIDACY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE.  SANT\'EGIDIO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS SPECIALIST MARIO GIRO CALLED DCM </p><p>01/10 TO SEEK USG SUPPORT IN FORWARDING THE SANT\'EGIDIO </p><p>CANDIDACY TO BE AN OBSERVER NGO AT THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00173  111447Z </p><p>COMMITTEE OF THE UN (ECOSOC).  GIRO EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO BELIEVES IT HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE GREAT </p><p>MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES SITTING ON THE "NGO COMMISSION" OF THE </p><p>ECOSOC, INCLUDING OF THE UNITED STATES.  GIRO AVERRED THAT </p><p>ALGERIA OBJECTS TO THE SANT\'EGIDIO CANDIDACY, AND HAS </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY USED PARLIAMENTARY MANEUVERS TO POSTPONE THE </p><p>VOTE. GIRO SOUGHT SUPPORT FROM THE US DEL FOR MOVING THE </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO CANDIDACY TO A VOTE DURING THE UPCOMING SESSION </p><p>OF THE "NGO COMMISSION" STARTING 01/14/02.  IF THEIR </p><p>CANDIDACY WERE TO BE BROUGHT TO A VOTE, GIRO WAS CONFIDENT </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO WOULD PREVAIL. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) IN A PHONE CONVERSATION WITH MONS. DOMINIQUE </p><p>MAMBERTI, THE HOLY SEE DESK OFFICER WHO COVERS UN ISSUES, </p><p>POLOFF ASKED WHETHER THIS CANDIDACY IS ON THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>RADAR SCREEN.  MAMBERTI WAS FAMILIAR WITH SANT\'EGIDIO\'S </p><p>PROBLEMS IN ALGERIA, BUT KNOW OF NO OBJECTIONS TO ITS ECOSOC </p><p>CANDIDACY IN THE HOLY SEE.  AFTER ALL, HE SAID, "THEY ARE </p><p>NOT SEEKING A PLACE ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL!" </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) COMMENT: SANT\'EGIDIO IS A RELIABLE INTERLOCUTOR OF </p><p>THIS EMBASSY, AND ONE WHICH WE HAVE COLLABORATED WITH IN </p><p>AREAS AS DIVERSE AS FUNDING ITS INTER-COMMUNAL EDUCATION </p><p>EFFORTS IN KOSOVO AND SUPPORTING ITS EFFORTS A MEDIATING </p><p>PEACE IN MOZAMBIQUE.  WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH </p><p>SANT\'EGIDIO TO SEE WHETHER THEY MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE IN </p><p>SUDAN.  WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT SANT\'EGIDIO HAS NEVER MADE </p><p>A FALSE STEP -- ALGERIA BEING A CASE IN POINT.  IN THE MID- </p><p>1990S SANT\'EGIDIO GOT INTO HOT WATER IN ALGERIA BY </p><p>ORGANIZING A MEETING WITH ALGERIAN OPPOSITION WITHOUT </p><p>COORDINATING ITS "BOOTLEG DIPLOMACY" EITHER WITH THE GOA OR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00173  111447Z </p><p>THE HOLY SEE. BOTH REACTED NEGATIVELY, AND THE GOA SEEMS </p><p>STILL TO WISH TO PUNISH SANT\'EGIDIO.  NEVERTHELESS, FROM </p><p>WHERE WE SIT THE GROUP HAS DONE A LOT OF GOOD WORK; CLEARLY </p><p>IT CAN CONTRIBUTE IN A POSITIVE FASHION TO THE WORK OF THE </p><p>ECOSOC AND WE ENDORSE ITS CANDIDACY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) ACTION REQUESTED:  PLEASE PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON HOW </p><p>TO RESPOND TO SANT\'EGIDIO\'S REQUEST. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA00173 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
