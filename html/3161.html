<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003296 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR NED SAUMS </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>STATE PASS USAID FOR MSCOVILL </p><p>TREASURY FOR PIPATANAGUL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN:  TRADE MINISTRY IN TALKS WITH ISRAEL TO </p><p>RESTRUCTURE QIZ REQUIREMENTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, reasons 1.5(b,d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  GOJ Trade Ministry officials tell us they have begun </p><p>talking to their Israeli counterparts about improving current </p><p>QIZ operations and regulations.  The GOJ\'s proposals include </p><p>both improvements to existing logistical procedures as well </p><p>as changes to the structure of required Israeli inputs into </p><p>QIZ goods.  The GOJ hopes improvements agreed to through </p><p>these talks will help spur new investment in the QIZ\'s </p><p>following stagnation of new investment into the sector since </p><p>2001.  If proposed improvements take hold, there could be a </p><p>measurable impact on the sustained competitiveness of QIZ\'s </p><p>and some diversification of the manufacturing base under the </p><p>initiative.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  Jordanian Trade Ministry Secretary General Samer </p><p>Tawil said he is in active discussion with his Israeli </p><p>counterparts to improve the functioning of the QIZ </p><p>initiative.  The ministry is building its position around a </p><p>report on QIZ sustainability recently completed by a trade </p><p>expert contracted for the Ministry by the USAID-funded </p><p>Jordan-US Business PArtnership for that purpose (report to be </p><p>pouched to NEA/ARN).  The ministry\'s position also reflects a </p><p>number of long-standing concerns voiced by QIZ exporters over </p><p>the past two years about inefficiencies in QIZ procedures and </p><p>rules. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>New Procedures Sought </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Recommendations in the report fall into two broad </p><p>categories: procedural adjustments to current QIZ product </p><p>processing requirements, and adjustments to the </p><p>sub-regulations on rules of origin and Israeli content </p><p>requirements.  In the first category are a number of </p><p>seemingly sound recommendations.  The first is a </p><p>recommendation to extend and institutionalize the use of the </p><p>on-line QPR (qualifying product registration) approval </p><p>process developed with USAID assistance last year.  The </p><p>program is not widely used now, due in part to early </p><p>technical glitches and in part to lack of awareness among </p><p>exporters that the system is available.  Widespread use of </p><p>the system could greatly reduce QPR approval times on the </p><p>Jordanian side, and adaptation of the program to Israeli QIZ </p><p>auditing processes could have a similar effect on the Israeli </p><p>side. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  The second recommendation of the study is to </p><p>extend the validity of QPR\'s beyond the current period of 12 </p><p>months, which would allow exporters to continue production on </p><p>identical styles year-on-year without clogging the QPR </p><p>approval pipeline with what amount to pro-forma approvals. </p><p>The third recommendation is for more frequent meetings of the </p><p>Israel-Jordan joint committee for QIZ issues.  The committee, </p><p>which is also supposed to include observers from the USG as </p><p>needed, has met at best sporadically in the past two years, </p><p>according to Tawil.  Finally, the report recommends creation </p><p>of a storage facility at the Gateway QIZ for stockpiling </p><p>Israeli inputs.  Following the sharp spike in violence in the </p><p>West Bank in the spring, many manufacturers have concerns </p><p>about disruption of access to inputs during another regional </p><p>crisis.  Having a store of inputs at Gateway could ease those </p><p>tensions. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Most of the procedural recommendations make </p><p>intuitive sense, though some - like the Gateway project - are </p><p>probably better handled through private sector initiative. </p><p>More sweeping, though, are proposals for changes to current </p><p>Israeli content rules under the QIZ initiative.  Many of </p><p>these ideas are based on long-standing gripes from exporters </p><p>that Israeli inputs are too expensive and/or not of </p><p>acceptable quality, but must be used because of current </p><p>content requirements.  However, the GOJ\'s arguments are </p><p>becoming more sophisticated, and are even beginning to show </p><p>an interest in a solution that will benefit both sides. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>New Israeli Content Proposals </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>6.  (c)  The GOJ\'s opening position in its talks with Israeli </p><p>counterparts, says Tawil, will be to secure a straight </p><p>reduction in Israeli content from 8% to 4% for textiles, with </p><p>an offer by the GOJ to accept an "increase" of content </p><p>requirements on hi-tech, jewelry, and medical/surgical goods </p><p>to 11.7% (note: under the current agreement, the 8% content </p><p>requirement is a temporary measure, with content due to be </p><p>reset to 11.7% for all goods in February 2004.  End note). </p><p>According to MoIT officials, the fallback GOJ position (not </p><p>elucidated in the study) is to propose a sliding scale of </p><p>content requirements for textiles, starting at 8% (or more, </p><p>depending on the good) for low-end products like T-shirts and </p><p>underwear and sliding to 4% or even 2% for higher-end goods </p><p>including suits, evening wear, leather apparel, and the like. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  At the same time, the GOJ is making a parallel </p><p>proposal to move from per-item pre-production audits to </p><p>year-end cumulative audits to certify Israeli content.  The </p><p>end result of such a switch would be the same as a sliding </p><p>scale - the governments would need to verify only the 8% </p><p>Israeli content on total exports by a given company, allowing </p><p>them to produce some goods with more than 8% content, and </p><p>some with less, over the course of the year. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Jordan\'s New Approach </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  While the proposals are not shockingly new, the </p><p>rationale behind them is.  The GOJ argues, with some </p><p>accuracy, that the current set-up restricts the growth of the </p><p>QIZ\'s out of low-end garment production, due to the </p><p>difficulty of meeting the 8% content rule for high-end goods </p><p>due to the limited availability of suitable, </p><p>price-competitive inputs from Israel.  They argue that the </p><p>proposed changes in content rules will attract a wider </p><p>variety of manufacturers, which will in turn substantially </p><p>boost production, thereby leading to a net increase in </p><p>Israeli inputs sold, even at lower percentages.  The GOJ thus </p><p>sees lowering - but not eliminating - Israeli content as a </p><p>gain for both sides.  The GOJ also argues that, as the </p><p>U.S.-Jordan FTA matures, the relative benefit of production </p><p>under the QIZ initiative will vanish, leaving exporters in </p><p>Jordan with little incentive to continue doing business with </p><p>Israel, where input prices are seen as high and quality low. </p><p>Thus they will argue that making content requirements more </p><p>flexible will help make production of Israeli inputs a more </p><p>sustainable business. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (c)  With new investment in the QIZ\'s relatively stagnant </p><p>in 2001, the GOJ is eager to find a way to jump-start </p><p>interest in the QIZ\'s without undermining the basic </p><p>philosophy of Jordanian-Israeli cooperation that underpins </p><p>the initiative.  The GOJ has parroted for months the narrow </p><p>interest of exporters in minimizing Israeli content </p><p>requirements.  It seems they may have finally found a way to </p><p>package a proposal that will show the Israeli side its </p><p>interest in more flexible content rules, as well as boosting </p><p>the initiative as one of the benefits of the peace process </p><p>that is supporting economic growth and stability in Jordan. </p><p>Taken together, the content and procedural proposals could </p><p>indeed spark diversification in the QIZ\'s and as a result </p><p>increase business on both sides of the border.  Getting </p><p>there, though, will mean convincing Israeli input producers </p><p>to reduce their guaranteed business in what amounts to a </p><p>captive market.  It could also mean convincing Israel that it </p><p>should negotiate on the assumption that 8% is the proper </p><p>status quo, and not the temporary measure it was originally </p><p>designed to be. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
