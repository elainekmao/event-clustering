<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 000618 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MOPS, ELAB, SO, PREL, MOPS, ELAB, SO, IT, ITPGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: SOMALIA:  AN ITALIAN NGO\'S PLAN B FOR PEACE </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL M C THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.    (SBU) SUMMARY:  ANGELO MASETTI, SECRETARY OF A </p><p>UNION-ORGANIZED GROUP THAT WORKS WITH SOMALIS IN ITALY, </p><p>SHARED WITH POLOFF JANUARY 31 AN ALTERNATIVE VISION FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00618  01 OF 02  141432Z </p><p>ACHIEVING PEACE IN SOMALIA.  MASETTI OPINED THAT THE CURRENT </p><p>PROCESS, BASED ON COOPERATION BY WARLORDS WHO PROFIT FROM THE </p><p>STATUS QUO AND COORDINATED BY STATES WITH THEIR OWN AGENDA, </p><p>WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE.  INSTEAD, HE ADVOCATED FORMING A </p><p>STEERING COMMITTEE THAT WOULD SCRIPT A NATIONAL CONSTITUTION </p><p>IN CONSULTATION WITH THE U.S., EU, AND UN, AND CONVENING </p><p>CONFERENCES OF SOMALIS AT HOME AND ABROAD TO AGREE ON IT. </p><p>THE PROPOSAL, WHICH THE GOI IS CONSIDERING SUPPORTING IN </p><p>PART, IS IN ITS NASCENT STAGES AND MAY BE PRESENTED FORMALLY </p><p>TO THE USG AS EVENTS WARRANT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.    (U) MASETTI, WHOSE FULL-TIME JOB IS COVERING MIGRATION </p><p>POLICIES FOR THE UIL LABOR CONFEDERATION, REQUESTED A MEETING </p><p>WITH POLOFF TO OUTLINE HIS GROUP\'S STRATEGY IN THE EVENT THAT </p><p>THE CURRENT PEACE PROCESS FAILS, LIKE ITS TWELVE </p><p>PREDECESSORS.  MASETTI IS THE SECRETARY OF THE ITALY-SOMALIA </p><p>FORUM FOR PEACE AND RECONSTRUCTION (ISF), AN NGO SPONSORED BY </p><p>ITALY\'S THREE MAIN TRADE UNION CONFEDERATIONS AS PART OF </p><p>THEIR OUTREACH TO LOCAL IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES.  THE ISF IS A </p><p>"VERY INFORMAL VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION" WITH NO OFFICE SPACE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO MASETTI.  IT WAS FOUNDED IN NOVEMBER 2001 BY </p><p>GIOVANNI CONSO (PRESIDENT EMERITUS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>COURT), GIANNI DE MICHELIS (FORMER MINISTER OF LABOR), AND </p><p>RINO SERRI (FORMER SENATOR AND UNDERSECRETARY OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS).  COMMENT:  MASETTI -- WHO IS OF ITALIAN AND SOMALI </p><p>HERITAGE -- IS WELL AND FAVORABLY KNOWN TO THE EMBASSY, AND </p><p>THE FOUNDERS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE CREDIBLE PEOPLE WITHOUT A </p><p>PARTICULAR POLITICAL AGENDA.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>"WE HAVE TO NEUTRALIZE THE WARLORDS" ... AND IGAD </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00618  01 OF 02  141432Z </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>3.    (U) MASETTI SHARED HIS VIEW THAT A RESOLUTION OF THE </p><p>PROBLEM WOULD REQUIRE THE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE WARLORDS. </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD ERRED IN TRYING TO BUILD A </p><p>SOLUTION ON WARLORD COOPERATION, FORGETTING THAT THE SOMALIS </p><p>ARE OPPRESSED BY THE WARLORDS.  THE PREVIOUS TWELVE </p><p>CONFERENCES HAD FAILED BECAUSE "EVERYTHING WAS LEFT IN THE </p><p>HANDS OF THE WARLORDS AT THE END."  THERE HAD BEEN NO </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MONITORING TO COMPEL DISARMAMENT OR CONTROL AID </p><p>PROJECTS.  AFTER THE ARTA PEACE PROCESS, THE TRANSITIONAL </p><p>NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS LEFT TO FEND FOR ITSELF, AND IN A </p><p>YEAR, IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE ACCORD HAD FAILED. </p><p> </p><p>4.    (U) FOR THEIR PART, THE WARLORDS HAD NO PLANS TO CEDE </p><p>POWER TO CIVIL STRUCTURES -- QUITE THE OPPOSITE.  "THE </p><p>WARLORDS HAVE NO INTEREST IN PEACE AND ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY </p><p>UNABLE TO MAKE PEACE.  HOW CAN YOU ASK A THIEF NOT TO STEAL </p><p>ANY MORE? ...  THE WARLORDS STAND TO LOSE MORE THAN ANYONE </p><p>FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PEACE," MASETTI STATED.  HE </p><p>BELIEVES THAT THE WARLORDS ONLY COOPERATE IN PEACEMAKING IN </p><p>ORDER TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF AID PACKAGES PROVIDED </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AFTER EACH ACCORD.  TO SAY THAT "POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERS" ARE PRESENT AT ELDORET IS A MISNOMER, HE SAID, SINCE </p><p>THESE PEOPLE ARE REALLY WARLORDS AND CLAN LEADERS, NOT </p><p>POLITICIANS.  LIKEWISE, WHAT REMAINED OF SOMALI CIVIL SOCIETY </p><p>MUST BE SUPPORTED BUT CANNOT BE VIEWED AS REPRESENTATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>5.    (U) GIVING A MAJOR ROLE TO IGAD IS ANOTHER KEY ERROR, </p><p>MASETTI ASSERTED.  FIRST, IGAD MEMBERS ARE TOO WEAK TO LEAD A </p><p>PEACE PROCESS.  SECOND, SOME OF THEM -- KENYA, DJIBOUTI, AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00618  01 OF 02  141432Z </p><p>ETHIOPIA -- HAVE DIVERGENT INTERESTS AND VISIONS OF THE </p><p>PREFERRED OUTCOME. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>DIASPORA COULD BE THE SOLUTION </p><p>FOR DISARMAMENT AND PEACEMAKING </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.    (U) ACCORDING TO MASETTI, MANY OF THE POTENTIAL </p><p>PROTAGONISTS IN A PEACE AGREEMENT ARE ABROAD, THOUGH HE </p><p>ADMITTED THAT EVEN WITH EXILES, "WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL, </p><p>BECAUSE THE MENTALITY IS VERY FRACTIOUS," WITH SOMALIS </p><p>TENDING TO PUT CLAN AND PRIVATE INTERESTS AHEAD OF NATIONAL </p><p>ONES.  UNDAUNTED, THE ISF IS IN THE PROCESS OF NETWORKING TO </p><p>CREATE A WORLD-WIDE ORGANIZATION TO REPRESENT SOMALI SOCIETY, </p><p>AT HOME AND ABROAD, IN THE "NEXT PEACE CONFERENCE." </p><p> </p><p>7.    (U) THE SPECIFIC PLAN HAS TWO ASPECTS, DISARMAMENT AND </p><p>PEACEMAKING.  THE BEST WAY TO DISARM THE WARLORDS IS TO RAISE </p><p>A  SOMALI ARMY TRAINED AND READY TO DO SO, MASETTI SAID.  THE </p><p>FLEDGLING NATIONAL ARMY WOULD BE CONSTITUTED ABROAD AND </p><p>CALLED TO SOMALIA TO IMPLEMENT THE ACCORD UPON ITS </p><p>COMPLETION.  TO ARRIVE AT A WORKABLE PEACE ACCORD, THE ISF </p><p>PROPOSES HOLDING A YEAR-LONG SERIES OF MEETINGS OF SOMALIS IN </p><p>EIGHT COUNTRIES:  THE USA, CANADA, UK, SWEDEN, THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8003 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  00618  02 OF 02  141432Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    FAAE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      ECA-00   PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------364F76  141432Z /38 </p><p>R 141345Z FEB 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8271 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>IGAD COLLECTIVE </p><p>CIA WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 000618 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/13/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MOPS, ELAB, SO, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: SOMALIA:  AN ITALIAN NGO\'S PLAN B FOR PEACE </p><p> </p><p>NETHERLANDS, ITALY, SOMALIA, AND AUSTRALIA.  EACH MEETING </p><p>WOULD DISCUSS AND PROPOSE AMENDMENTS TO A DRAFT CONSTITUTION </p><p>TO BE DRAWN UP BY A STEERING COMMITTEE IN CONSULTATION WITH </p><p>THE U.S., EU, AND UN.  FINALLY, A REPRESENTATIVE GROUP OF </p><p>150-200 DELEGATES FROM THE NATIONAL MEETINGS WOULD MEET TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00618  02 OF 02  141432Z </p><p>FORM A PROVISIONAL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TO FINALIZE THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION.  THE PROPOSAL BE WOULD BUDGETED AT 1-1.5M EURO. </p><p> THIS PLAN WOULD HAVE THE ADDED BENEFIT OF EMPOWERING </p><p>INTELLECTUALS AND TECHNOCRATS, WHO WOULD THEN BE BETTER </p><p>PREPARED TO WORK ON POLITICAL AND SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>AFTERWARDS.  THE WARLORDS COULD PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS </p><p>BUT ONLY ON THE SAME TERMS AS EVERYBODY ELSE (WHEREAS "NOW </p><p>THEY\'RE IN CHARGE").  AT THE CONCLUSION, THEY WOULD BE FORCED </p><p>TO ACCEPT THE ACCORD OR BECOME OUTLAWS TO BE FORCIBLY </p><p>DISARMED AND PERHAPS TRIED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>NEXT STEPS TOWARD AN "INTELLIGENT SOLUTION;" MFA RESPONSE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.    (C) MASETTI STRESSED THAT THE ISF IS NOT AGAINST </p><p>ELDORET.  IT HOPES THAT ELDORET WILL SUCCEED BUT WANTS TO </p><p>BEGIN WORK ON A FALLBACK PLAN IN CASE IT DOES NOT.  MASETTI </p><p>HAD PRESENTED THE ISF\'S PROPOSAL TO THE MFA, BUT "THE </p><p>FARNESINA (MFA) IS LOYAL TO ELDORET," HE OBSERVED.  IN A </p><p>FEBRUARY 12 TELCON, MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR EAST AFRICAN </p><p>AFFAIRS PAOLA IMPERIALE SAID THAT THE MFA IS STUDYING THE </p><p>PROPOSAL.  IMPERIALE SAID THAT THE MFA WAS IN FACT INTERESTED </p><p>IN SUPPORTING A MEETING OF SOMALI EXILES IN ITALY IF THE ISF </p><p>COULD HOLD IT IN SUPPORT OF ELDORET, NOT IN COMPETITION TO </p><p>IT.  (ITALIAN LAW DOES NOT PERMIT THE MFA TO FUND MEETINGS </p><p>FOR EXILES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.)  HOWEVER, THE MFA QUESTIONED </p><p>THE PLAN TO HAVE EXILES CONSTITUTE A MAJORITY IN THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY.  "DO YOU THINK ITALIANS WOULD ACCEPT IT IF AN </p><p>ASSEMBLY DOMINATED BY ITALIAN AMERICANS AND ITALIAN BRITONS </p><p>WERE TO DECIDE ON ITS CONSTITUTION?" SHE ASKED. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00618  02 OF 02  141432Z </p><p> </p><p>9.    (U) MASETTI BELIEVES THAT "CONSTANT CONSULTATION WITH </p><p>THE U.S., EU, AND UN" IS THE "WISEST WAY TO PROCEED."  HE </p><p>HOPES TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ONGOING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION </p><p>WITH THE USG BUT IS NOT YET AT THE POINT OF REQUESTING </p><p>CONSULTATIONS IN WASHINGTON OR BACKING.  HE DID, HOWEVER, </p><p>MENTION THAT VISA FACILITATION WOULD BE APPRECIATED, AS TWO </p><p>MEMBERS OF HIS ORGANIZATION WERE PLANNING A MISSION TO THE </p><p>STATES TO CONSULT WITH SOMALI EXILES THERE ON THE PLAN.  IF </p><p>THE ISF DEVELOPS POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR ITS PLAN, IT WILL ASK </p><p>THE US AND EU FOR FUNDING. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  MASETTI\'S PLAN SEEMS STARRY-EYED IN </p><p>SEVERAL ASPECTS, NOT LEAST THE IDEA THAT AN ARMY DRAWING ON </p><p>SOMALIS IN DIVERSE COUNTRIES COULD BE TRAINED AND EQUIPPED IN </p><p>EXILE TO PARACHUTE IN AT THE MOMENT OF NEED.  NONETHELESS, </p><p>MASETTI HIMSELF, AS WELL AS ISF\'S FOUNDERS, ARE SERIOUS </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WITH GOOD INTENT.  WE REPORT THE IDEA AGAINST THE </p><p>DAY THE GROUP REQUESTS MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON FOR FURTHER </p><p>CONSULTATIONS.  THE PROPOSAL WILL BE E-MAILED TO AF/E. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00618 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
