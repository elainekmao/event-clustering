Boggs for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Ambassador Malinowski visited </p><p>UNHCR-administered camps in eastern Nepal during the weekend </p><p>of February 15-16 to assess the situation of the Bhutanese </p><p>refugees and to monitor the provision of food and other </p><p>assistance from donor countries including the United States. </p><p>The high-level delegation, including Ambassadors from the UK </p><p>and Australia, toured the camps, reviewed new administrative </p><p>procedures, and accepted petitions from refugee groups, </p><p>requesting donor pressure on Thimpu to take back the </p><p>refugees. The meetings followed a visit by the DCM in </p><p>December.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>APPEALS FROM THE REFUGEES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Joined by Ambassadors from the UK and Australia, as </p><p>well representatives from France, Germany, Norway, Finland </p><p>and the European Commission, Ambassador Malinowski toured </p><p>UNHCR-administered Bhutanese refugee camps in Eastern Nepal </p><p>on February 15-16.  The arrival of the eight-member </p><p>delegation was heralded with traditional Bhutanese trumpets </p><p>and garlands of flowers, but refugee leaders soon got down to </p><p>more serious business at a roundtable meeting in one of the </p><p>camp\'s community rooms.  Under handwritten signs saying "I </p><p>love my mother country Bhutan," and "Please consider our </p><p>plight," representatives presented several petitions, each </p><p>requesting that future financial aid to Bhutan be predicated </p><p>on demonstrated respect for human rights, and seeking </p><p>international efforts to persuade Bhutan to "take back its </p><p>citizens." </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Petitions from women\'s rights groups and the general </p><p>camp population included additional appeals, ranging from </p><p>cessation of allotment to other Bhutanese of land formerly </p><p>owned by refugees, to adoption of only two </p><p>categories--Bhutanese and non-Bhutanese--for use in the </p><p>verification process.  The latter issue is a particularly </p><p>sensitive one for many in the camps, who see the adoption of </p><p>four categories (those forcibly evicted from Bhutan, those </p><p>who left Bhutan voluntarily, criminals, and non-Bhutanese) </p><p>(ref C) as a ploy by Bhutan to avoid repatriating significant </p><p>numbers of  refugees.  Citing India\'s "better position" to </p><p>negotiate with Thimpu, the petitions also called on the </p><p>delegation to "persuade the government of India to use its </p><p>good office to resolve the crisis." </p><p> </p><p>STATE OF THE CAMPS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Administration of the camps has undergone significant </p><p>changes following accusations of sexual abuse of refugees by </p><p>NGO workers (ref D), and the condition of the camps is good. </p><p>In general, the demeanor of the refugees is peaceful, with no </p><p>sign of hostility or agitation.  Refugee services are </p><p>well-organized, and the camp residents are well-fed and </p><p>clothed.  At the food distribution point, weekly and </p><p>bi-weekly schedules are posted on large signs, and the </p><p>distribution process is orderly.  The warehouse is </p><p>well-stocked with pallets of rice and other supplies.  Though </p><p>employment inside the camp is minimal, a small textile </p><p>factory was operating during the delegation\'s visit, and some </p><p>women were engaged in the small-scale manufacture of </p><p>traditional fabrics. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Touring the camp, the Ambassador also visited a </p><p>children\'s play area, a school for the mentally challenged, </p><p>and a small elementary school with a burlap-covered floor, </p><p>where students, surrounded by pictures of birds and animals, </p><p>were boisterously participating in a language lesson. </p><p>Facilities for the children appear adequate, especially by </p><p>Nepali standards. </p><p> </p><p>CONSIDERING THEIR PLIGHT </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>6. (U) Despite the well-mannered population, the well-ordered </p><p>services and the well-stocked warehouse, life in the camps is </p><p>not without frustration.  The weavers working busily at their </p><p>hand-looms are prohibited from selling their products outside </p><p>the camps.  Employment opportunities for working-age refugees </p><p>are extremely limited, and children are deprived of any </p><p>chance for higher education.  After thirteen years of delay </p><p>and perceived duplicity by the Thimpu government, the </p><p>majority of refugees want to return to their homeland as </p><p>expeditiously as possible.  Impatience and dissatisfaction </p><p>are not far below the tranquil surface.  "We want to be </p><p>repatriated by 2003," read one of the signs at a rally of a </p><p>reported 35,000 refugee women on the day of the delegation\'s </p><p>visit.  Children\'s rallies, bicycle rallies and relay hunger </p><p>strikes are also planned by the refugee community as part of </p><p>a protest program to try to persuade donor countries to put </p><p>financial pressure on the GOB.  "We would like to urge your </p><p>Excellency to make sure that... financial aid to Bhutan is </p><p>being used for the welfare of its people," wrote 200 students </p><p>in grades three through ten.  Many of the children have lived </p><p>their entire lives in the camps, but still hope to "return" </p><p>to Bhutan. "We urge you all to help us go home." </p><p> </p><p>PREVIOUS VISIT BY DCM </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) The Ambassador\'s observations were supported by those </p><p>of the DCM, who accompanied Senior Senate Staff Member Jonah </p><p>Blank on a tour of three of the refugee camps in December. </p><p>The DCM and Blank found the camps impressively well organized </p><p>and self-governed, despite the recent revelations of sexual </p><p>abuse by several refugee employees.  Visits to a number of </p><p>randomly selected refugee homes suggested that many </p><p>(reportedly most) families have documents proving that they </p><p>had been legal citizens of Bhutan prior to 1990.  In meetings </p><p>with the governing councils of the camps, DCM and Blank </p><p>sounded out camp leaders on what possible solutions they </p><p>envisioned to their plight as refugees.  In every camp such </p><p>questions provoked confusion--if not incomprehension--about </p><p>any solution other than return to Bhutan.  Permanent </p><p>settlement in Nepal was a distant second choice, and </p><p>resettlement abroad appeared unimaginable.  Clearly, the </p><p>culture of the camps has preserved intact the notion that </p><p>every refugee would someday return to his/her homeland of </p><p>Bhutan.  Several refugees explained that their families had </p><p>been living in Bhutan for generations, since the grandfather </p><p>of the present king invited them to emigrate from Nepal to </p><p>settle Bhutan\'s lower hills, where up-country Bhutanese </p><p>ethnics refused to live.  Like the Ambassador, the DCM and </p><p>Blank found that the schools still teach Dzongka (Bhutan\'s </p><p>dominant language) and Bhutanese history although everyone in </p><p>the camps speaks Bhutanese-accented Nepali.  The notion that </p><p>Bhutan was their "home" was shared even by the 22 percent of </p><p>the refugees who were born in the camps. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The DCM and Blank held long discussions with </p><p>locally-based UNHCR staff and with the acting Country </p><p>Director, Abraham Abraham.  The UNHCR officers confirmed our </p><p>impressions that the camps are exceptionally well-managed and </p><p>quiescent by world standards.  Abraham explained, however, </p><p>that the completion of document verification among the 12,000 </p><p>residents of the camp at Khudunabari over a year ago with no </p><p>obvious progress toward repatriation had raised levels of </p><p>impatience and frustration in the camps.  The current hunger </p><p>strike in Khudunabari is just one symptom of growing </p><p>restlessness.  UNHCR security staff disclosed that Maoist </p><p>militants are believed to have transited several of the camps </p><p>under cover of darkness and may have spent the night in </p><p>refugee houses.  Youthful unemployment and frustration, they </p><p>warned, were likely eventually to make the camps receptive </p><p>recruiting grounds for the Maoists.  None of the UNHCR </p><p>officers believed that India would apply pressure on Bhutan </p><p>to accept at least some of the refugees.  They urged the USG </p><p>to work with Bhutan\'s international donors to expedite the </p><p>current bilateral negotiating process and press for early </p><p>implementation of a formula that would involve refugees being </p><p>settled in both Bhutan and Nepal, and possibly third </p><p>countries.  Abraham Abraham expressed repeatedly his anxiety </p><p>that growing funding fatigue among UNHCR\'s donors would soon </p><p>render the camps economically unsustainable. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) We share the view of local UNHCR officers that the </p><p>Bhutanese refugee camps are likely to become growing sources </p><p>of political agitation in the tri-border area of Nepal, </p><p>Bhutan and India if concrete steps toward a resolution of the </p><p>problem are not taken soon.  Although the Foreign Ministers </p><p>of Nepal and Bhutan appear to have made some progress during </p><p>their recent meeting in Kathmandu (Ref B), it is still not </p><p>clear that the bilateral process will move fast enough to </p><p>prevent the emergence of an increasingly explosive situation. </p><p> The bilateral process is essential, but international </p><p>pressure is necessary also to persuade the Bhutanese </p><p>Government that it can no longer evade its responsibilities. </p><p>Post looks forward to a full readout on the Bhutan donors </p><p>meeting in Geneva and the promised paper by UNHCR (Ref A). </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
