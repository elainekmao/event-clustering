VASQUEZ: THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) AND THE </p><p>UNITED STATES PEACE CORPS HAVE MUCH IN COMMON. THE STRENGTH </p><p>OF OUR COMMON INTERESTS LEADS ME TO PROPOSE THAT WE JOIN </p><p>TOGETHER IN A BOLD NEW PARTNERSHIP TO INVOLVE 1,000 PEACE </p><p>CORPS VOLUNTEERS IN WORLD FOOD PROGRAM ACTIVITIES BY 2004. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  05813  01 OF 03  031159Z </p><p>BOTH OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS WORK TO BETTER THE LIVES OF THE </p><p>POOREST PEOPLE IN THE POOREST COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.  WE </p><p>ARE BOTH COMMITTED TO EDUCATION, MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH AND </p><p>NUTRITION, ARRESTING THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF HIV/AIDS, AND </p><p>HELPING THOSE SUFFERING FROM NATURAL DISASTERS. </p><p> </p><p>THE PEACE CORPS AND WFP ARE WORKING IN ABOUT 40 OF THE SAME </p><p>COUNTRIES.  OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE ALREADY COLLABORATED </p><p>(ALBEIT ON A RELATIVELY SMALL SCALE), WITH VOLUNTEERS </p><p>WORKING IN WFP-ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AS NEGOTIATED </p><p>AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL, AND WITH CRISIS CORPS VOLUNTEERS </p><p>WORKING ALONGSIDE WFP IN SOME RECENT EMERGENCIES.  WFP HAS </p><p>ALSO HIRED FORMER PEACE CORPS STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS AND </p><p>EXCHANGED INFORMATION ON CROSS-CULTURAL AND SECURITY </p><p>TRAINING FOR OUR PERSONNEL. </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS ONE AREA IN PARTICULAR WHERE I THINK WE COULD HAVE </p><p>A TREMENDOUS IMPACT BY WORKING MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER.  TWO </p><p>YEARS AGO, WITH ALMOST 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND MUCH </p><p>SUCCESS IN THE FIELD, WFP UNDERTOOK A GLOBAL CAMPAIGN FOR </p><p>SCHOOL FEEDING. </p><p> </p><p>THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN SUPPORTED IN NO SMALL PART BY THE </p><p>UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.
