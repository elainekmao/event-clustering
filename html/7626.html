<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 000489 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, BM </p><p>SUBJECT:  A VISIT TO A WWII REMAINS RECOVERY SITE </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  COM, DASD Jerry Jennings (POW and MIA </p><p>Affairs), DATT, and others inspected ongoing WWII remains </p><p>recovery operations in Burma\'s northernmost Kachin State on </p><p>March 23.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  After flying from Rangoon to the Kachin capital of </p><p>Myitkyina aboard a USAF C-12 out of Bangkok, the USG </p><p>delegation paid a courtesy call on the Burmese military\'s </p><p>Northern Region Commander, Major General Maung Maung Swe. </p><p>The COM, DASD, and party then flew 30 miles northwest of </p><p>Myitkyina on a Lao West Coast leased helicopter to Burma 3, </p><p>the crash site of a C-47 lost during WWII. </p><p> </p><p>3.  The CILHI recovery operation was being carried out on a </p><p>steep slope at an altitude of approximately 7,500 feet. </p><p>Most of the airplane wreckage visible on photographs taken </p><p>some months earlier had been removed by pilferers prior to </p><p>the team\'s arrival.  Still, the photographs provided enough </p><p>identifying data to apparently correlate the crash site to a </p><p>C-47A lost on August 19, 1944, with a manifested crew of </p><p>seven. </p><p> </p><p>4.  After inspecting the recovery operation in Kachin State, </p><p>the group flew back to Rangoon and met with S-1 General Khin </p><p>Nyunt.  (NOTE: Khin Nyunt, the regime\'s third-ranking </p><p>official and Chief of Military Intelligence, has been a </p><p>staunch supporter of the remains recovery operation.  End </p><p>Note)  During the call, DASD Jennings thanked the GOB for </p><p>its good cooperation throughout the recovery operation and </p><p>for providing increased security for the American recovery </p><p>team due to the war in Iraq.  He asked the GOB to help </p><p>protect crash sites from pilfering to allow U.S. </p><p>anthropologists to better assess them, and to review the </p><p>possibility of using GOB helicopters in support of future </p><p>remains recovery operations. </p><p> </p><p>5.  General Khin Nyunt stated that the level of cooperation </p><p>for this project was possible because of the cease-fires the </p><p>GOB had reached with former ethnic insurgents that had long </p><p>battled the GOB in the area.  He also gave assurances that </p><p>the GOB would take measures to protect the sites from </p><p>pilferage. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment:  The GOB\'s willingness to assist and its </p><p>ability to gain cooperation from various cease-fire groups </p><p>in Kachin State increases prospects for the success of </p><p>future recovery operations.  Several probable crash sites </p><p>have already been identified for possible excavation in the </p><p>future.  Reporting of additional crash sites has already </p><p>risen as the U.S. presence in Myitkyina has sparked the </p><p>local population\'s interest in remains recovery operations. </p><p>End Comment. MARTINEZ </p><p></p></div>
