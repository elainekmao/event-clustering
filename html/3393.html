END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) ON JULY 24, AN ETHNIC CO TU (KATU) PROTESTANT </p><p>PASTOR AND AN ETHNIC RO NGAO (RENGAO) CONGREGATION </p><p>MEMBER FROM KON TUM PROVINCE - THE MOST REMOTE OF </p><p>VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS PROVINCES - TRAVELED DOWN </p><p>TO HCMC TO TELL CG AND POLOFF OF THE DIFFICULTIES THEY </p><p>ARE EXPERIENCING THERE.  AN HCMC RELIGIOUS CONTACT HAD </p><p>RECOMMENDED THAT THEY TRY TO SEE US.  (NOTE: POST IS </p><p>REFRAINING FROM NAMING SOURCES IN THIS SBU REPORT.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) THE PASTOR, WHO LIVES IN KON TUM CITY, SAID HE </p><p>HAS BEEN PREACHING TO SEVERAL FAMILIES IN A </p><p>PREDOMINANTLY CATHOLIC ETHNIC RO NGAO VILLAGE NAMED DAK </p><p>CHACH IN KON TUM PROVINCE\'S DAK HA DISTRICT FOR SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS.  THE CONGREGATION MEMBER, A RESIDENT OF THIS </p><p>VILLAGE, SAID DISTRICT AND VILLAGE POLICE HAD GATHERED </p><p>THE VILLAGERS TOGETHER ON MARCH 20, TO TELL THEM TO </p><p>GIVE UP PROTESTANTISM AND TO BEAT THE PASTOR AND </p><p>DESTROY HIS VEHICLE NEXT TIME HE CAME TO THE VILLAGE. </p><p>ON MARCH 30, DISTRICT AND VILLAGE POLICE TOLD THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00759  01 OF 02  290756Z </p><p>RESIDENTS THAT THEY EXPECTED THE PASTOR THE FOLLOWING </p><p>DAY AND REITERATED THEIR INSTRUCTIONS TO "GIVE HIM A </p><p>BEATING." </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) THE PASTOR AND CONGREGATION MEMBER DESCRIBED </p><p>THAT WHEN THE PASTOR CAME TO DAK CHACH VILLAGE ON APRIL </p><p>1, ABOUT 20 ETHNIC RO NGAO CATHOLIC RESIDENTS CORNERED </p><p>HIM AND BEAT HIM SEVERELY FOR THREE HOURS.  (POST NOTE: </p><p>POST HAS SEEN PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE PASTOR, ALLEGEDLY </p><p>TAKEN AFTER HE RETURNED TO KON TUM CITY.  HE IS CLEARLY </p><p>HEAVILY BRUISED AND SWOLLEN, WITH WELTS ON HIS BACK, </p><p>SIDES, AND BLACK EYES.)  THE CONGREGATION MEMBER CALLED </p><p>THE PASTOR\'S WIFE (WHO WAS 25 KILOMETERS AWAY) TO </p><p>NOTIFY HER.  THE PASTOR\'S WIFE CALLED PROVINCIAL AND </p><p>DISTRICT SECURITY OFFICES AND THE POLICE 113 EMERGENCY </p><p>NUMBER, BUT THEY TOLD HER IT WAS JUST A MINOR CLASH </p><p>BETWEEN CATHOLICS AND PROTESTANTS.  THE CONGREGATION </p><p>MEMBER SAID THAT WHEN HE AND HIS WIFE TRIED TO ASSIST </p><p>THE PASTOR, THEY WERE ALSO BEATEN BY THE VILLAGERS. </p><p>THE PASTOR RELATED THAT SOME VILLAGERS HAD APOLOGIZED </p><p>TO HIM AFTERWARDS, SAYING THEY HAD BEEN ORDERED TO DO </p><p>WHAT THEY DID. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) THE PASTOR SAID THAT AFTER HE RETURNED TO KON </p><p>TUM CITY, DAK HA DISTRICT POLICE INFORMED HIM THAT HE </p><p>WOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO PREACH IN THE DISTRICT -- </p><p>AND IF HE DID, THE LAW WOULD NOT PROTECT HIM.  HE HAS </p><p>NOT BEEN BACK TO PREACH. </p><p> </p><p>6.

BULLDOZER </p><p>TRACKS COULD BE CLEARLY SEEN.  HE SAID THE POLICE ALSO </p><p>CONFISCATED THE "RED BOOK," WHICH PROVES HIS OWNERSHIP </p><p>OF THE PROPERTY WHERE HIS HOUSE STOOD.  HE HAS BEEN </p><p>UNEMPLOYED SINCE APRIL, AND HAS BEEN LIVING WITH </p><p>FRIENDS OR RELATIVES FOR A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS, BEFORE </p><p>MOVING ON SOMEWHERE ELSE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS, THE PASTOR WAS </p><p>EMPHATIC IN ASSERTING THAT THE SIZABLE PROTESTANT </p><p>POPULATION OF KON TUM PROVINCE ARE MAINSTREAM BELIEVERS </p><p>WHO ONLY PRACTICE PRAYING TO GOD.  THERE ARE NO "DEGA </p><p>PROTESTANTS" - PROTESTANTS WITH A POLITICAL AGENDA - </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE PASTOR.  HE BELIEVES PROVINCIAL </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN KON TUM REFUSE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN </p><p>"DEGA" AND MAINSTREAM PROTESTANTS IN AN EFFORT TO </p><p>JUSTIFY "ELIMINATING" PROTESTANTISM IN THE PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  PREVIOUSLY, THIS PASTOR HAD SENT WORD THROUGH </p><p>OUR MUTUAL HCMC CONTACT THAT HE WOULD WELCOME A VISIT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ7256 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HO CHI  00759  02 OF 02  290757Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  SRPP-00  EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      ED-01    UTED-00  HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     NSAE-00  OIC-02   OPIC-01  PRS-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /009W </p><p>                  ------------------D16618  290757Z /38 </p><p>P 290644Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6568 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY HANOI PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000759 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/PD/KFOSTER </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR PRM </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00759  02 OF 02  290757Z </p><p>BY CONGENOFFS TO KON TUM.  WHEN ASKED FACE-TO-FACE </p><p>WHETHER SUCH A VISIT WOULD BE HELPFUL OR HURTFUL TO HIM </p><p>AND HIS CONGREGATION, HE HESITATED.  HE THEN RESPONDED </p><p>THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES </p><p>WILL REACT TO "INFORMAL" VISITS.  HE SAID HE WOULD LET </p><p>US KNOW AFTER HIS RETURN TO KON TUM. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) COMMENT: POST CANNOT GENERALIZE ABOUT SYSTEMIC </p><p>VIOLENT HARASSMENT OF MAINSTREAM PROTESTANTS IN KON TUM </p><p>PROVINCE BASED ON THIS SINGLE FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT.  BUT </p><p>WE BELIEVE IN THIS PASTOR\'S BONAFIDES.  ELEMENTS </p><p>DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT - BEATINGS OF PROTESTANT </p><p>PASTORS AND FOLLOWERS, POLICE HIRING OR ORDERING LOCAL </p><p>RESIDENTS AND/OR THUGS TO DO THE DIRTY WORK, AND </p><p>PROTESTANT RESIDENTS BEING EXPELLED FROM THEIR VILLAGES </p><p>- ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE WE HAVE HEARD IN NUMEROUS SECOND </p><p>AND THIRD-HAND REPORTS FROM THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND </p><p>OTHER PROVINCES.  THIS HAS BEEN THE FIRST FIRSTHAND </p><p>REPORT ABOUT AN ASSAULT ON A PROTESTANT PASTOR IN KON </p><p>TUM PROVINCE WITH CREDIBLE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
