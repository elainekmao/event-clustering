THE ONLY ARAB MEMBER OF THE </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL, YEMEN, DECLARED THAT IT WOULD NOT </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE DEBATE OR VOTE AS IT HAD NOT YET </p><p>RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS FROM ITS CAPITAL.  KUWAIT, IRAQ </p><p>AND NINE SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE </p><p>DEBATE; EIGHT SC MEMBERS IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. </p><p>CO-SPONSORED THE U.S. RESOLUTION CONDEMNING IRAQ, </p><p>CALLING FOR A WITHDRAWAL OF IRAQI FORCES AND </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS IN THE DISPUTE. </p><p> </p><p>3.

(U) IN THE EARLY MORNING FORMAL SESSION OF THE SC, </p><p>THE KUWAITI PERMREP SPOKE FIRST, EXPRESSING HIS </p><p>"BITTERNESS AND EMBARRASSMENT" TO BE IN THE POSITION OF </p><p>HAVING BEEN ATTACKED BY A "PREVIOUSLY FRIENDLY COUNTRY" </p><p>WHICH HAD IN THE PAST BEEN PRAISED FOR ITS ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>THE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN THE REGION.  HE </p><p>STATED THAT BAGHDAD RADIO HAD ANNOUNCED THE GOAL OF THE </p><p>INVASION AS A COUP DETAT AND THE ESTABLISHMENT IN KUWAIT </p><p>OF A GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD BE FRIENDLY TOWARD IRAQ.  THE </p><p>KUWAITI PERMREP CONTINUED THAT AMIR OF KUWAIT AND HEAD </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT WERE IN CONTROL.  HE URGED THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL TO CONDEMN THE FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF THE UN </p><p>CHARTER AND ASK FOR THE UNCONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL OF </p><p>IRAQI FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  THE IRAQI PERMREP FOLLOWED WITH A STATEMENT </p><p>THAT "THE EVENTS TAKING PLACE IN KUWAIT RELATED TO A </p><p>PURELY INTERNAL MATTER."  HE SAID THAT THE "FREE </p><p>PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT" OF KUWAIT HAD REQUESTED IRAQI </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER AND THAT IRAQ WANTED </p><p>ONLY GOOD RELATIONS WITH KUWAIT AND WOULD WITHDRAW ITS </p><p>FORCES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  DECLARING THAT "THOSE </p><p>SITTING IN THE CHAIR ARE NOT THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT," </p><p>THE IRAQI PERMREP SAID THAT U.S. SPONSORSHIP OF THE </p><p>RESOLUTION BEFORE THE SC PROVED THAT THE UNITED STATES </p><p>WAS IN COLLUSION WITH THE "PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>KUWAIT". </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) AMBASSADOR PICKERING LED OFF THE DEBATE WITH A </p><p>STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE IRAQI INVASION, WHICH WAS A </p><p>CLEAR INSTANCE OF AGGRESSION, AND MAKING CLEAR THAT THE </p><p>UNITED STATES WAS STANDING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH </p><p>KUWAIT.  PICKERING APPEALED TO THE COUNCIL TO ACCEPT ITS </p><p>FULL RESPONSIBILITIES, NEITHER VACILLATE NOR </p><p>PROCRASTINATE AND ADOPT IMMEDIATELY THE DRAFT </p><p>RESOLUTION.  THE FULL TEXT OF PICKERING\'S STATEMENT IS </p><p>AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p>AT ABOUT 6:30PM EASTERN DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME OR SHORTLY </p><p>AFTER MIDNIGHT IN KUWAIT AND IRAQ, IRAQI FORCES MOVED </p><p>INTO KUWAIT TERRITORY, ACCORDING TO REPORTS RECEIVED </p><p>FROM THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN KUWAIT.  THESE MILITARY </p><p>FORCES CROSSED OVER INTO KUWAITI TERRITORY ALL ALONG THE </p><p>FRONTIER ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS.  THE FORCES RAPIDLY </p><p>PROCEEDED TO KUWAIT CITY AND THEY ARE CURRENTLY PRESENT </p><p>IN THAT CITY. </p><p> </p><p>THERE WAS OPPOSITION TO THE MOVEMENT OF THESE MILITARY </p><p>FORCES, FIRING, AND COMBAT.  WE ARE NOT AWARE YET OF THE </p><p>EXTENT OF CASUALTIES, BUT WE ARE INFORMED THAT KUWAITI </p><p>FORCES ARE RESISTING THE ADVANCE OF THE IRAQIS. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE THE IRAQI INVASION WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED AND </p><p>PROFESSIONALLY EXECUTED, THE IRAQIS AT ONE POINT MADE A </p><p>SERIOUS MISTAKE.  INSTEAD OF STAGING A COUP D\'ETAT AND </p><p>INSTALLING THE SO CALLED FREE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT </p><p>BEFORE THE INVASION THEY GOT IT THE WRONG WAY AROUND. </p><p>THEY INVADED KUWAIT AND THEN STAGED THE COUP D\'ETAT IN A </p><p>BLATANT AND DECEITFUL EFFORT TO TRY TO JUSTIFY THEIR </p><p>ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS WITH GREAT HAPPINESS THAT I HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT </p><p>THE AMIR, CROWN PRINCE AND FOREIGN MINISTER ARE SAFE AND </p><p>DIRECTING THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WITHIN THE LAST FEW HOURS, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ISSUED </p><p>THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT: </p><p> </p><p>"THE UNITED STATES STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE IRAQI MILITARY </p><p>INVASION OF KUWAIT AND CALLS FOR THE IMMEDIATE AND </p><p>UNCONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL OF ALL IRAQI FORCES.  WE HAVE </p><p>CONVEYED THIS MESSAGE TO THE IRAQI AMBASSADOR IN </p><p>WASHINGTON AND TO THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT THROUGH OUR </p><p>EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD.  WE DEPLORE THIS BLATANT USE OF </p><p>MILITARY AGGRESSION AND VIOLATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>CHARTER.  TOGETHER WITH KUWAIT, WE ARE CALLING FOR AN </p><p>EMERGENCY SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL." </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES HAS MADE CLEAR THAT IT WILL STAND </p><p>SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH KUWAIT IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PRESENT AGGRESSION WAS </p><p>COMPLETELY UNPROVOKED.  THE UNITED STATES POLICY HAS </p><p>BEEN TO SUPPORT EVERY DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>PRESENT CRISIS.  THUS WE DID NOT ARRIVE LIGHTLY AT OUR </p><p>POSITION OF CALLING FOR A SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING OR </p><p>SEEKING AN IMMEDIATE RESOLUTION WHICH WOULD CONDEMN THE </p><p>IRAQI INVASION, CALL FOR THE IMMEDIATE UNCONDITIONAL </p><p>WITHDRAWAL OF IRAQI TROOPS, AND SUPPORT A PROCESS OF </p><p>NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IRAQ AND </p><p>KUWAIT AND PARTICULARLY THE EFFORTS BEING UNDERTAKEN BY </p><p>THE ARAB LEAGUE IN THIS REGARD. </p><p> </p><p>WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH MANY STATES IN THE REGION IN </p><p>AN EFFORT TO SEEK THEIR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>ACTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BRING ABOUT AN </p><p>END TO THIS HEINOUS ACT OF THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE </p><p>CONTRARY TO THE CHARTER, INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND ALL THE </p><p>FULLY ACCEPTED FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL BEHAVIOR. </p><p> </p><p>THE COUNCIL HAS SELDOM FACED A MORE BLATANT USE OF </p><p>FORCE.  THE COUNCIL SHOULD ACT IMMEDIATELY IN DEALING </p><p>WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THE UNITED STATES, PLEASED TO JOIN </p><p>WITH EIGHT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, IS PROPOSING A </p><p>DRAFT RESOLUTION TEXT FOR IMMEDIATE ADOPTION BY THE </p><p>COUNCIL.  THE COUNCIL CERTAINLY CAN DO NO LESS IN THIS </p><p>TIME OF PRESENT CRISIS THAN TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY AND </p><p>RAPIDLY WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM. </p><p> </p><p>WE ASK THE COUNCIL TO ACCEPT ITS FULL RESPONSIBILITIES </p><p>AND TO SUPPORT KUWAIT IN ITS HOUR OF NEED.  IT IS TIME </p><p>FOR PEACE AND DIPLOMACY, NOT THE TIME FOR WAR AND </p><p>AGGRESSION.  THE WORLD IS NOW WATCHING WHAT WE DO HERE </p><p>AND WILL NOT BE SATISFIED WITH VACILLATION AND </p><p>PROCRASTINATION. </p><p> </p><p>IN THIS TIME OF MOST SERIOUS CRISIS, I ASK ALL THE </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL CAREFULLY TO CONTEMPLATE </p><p>THE IMMENSE ISSUES BEFORE US AND TO ACT IN THE WAY IN </p><p>WHICH THEY AS MEMBERS OF THIS ORGANIZATION, AND STATES </p><p>COMMITTED TO ACT UNDER THE CHARTER, SHOULD ACT. </p><p> </p><p>THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  SEVEN OTHER SC MEMBERS SPOKE IN THE DEBATE. </p><p>COLOMBIA INDICATED THAT IT WAS SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTION </p><p>FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT IT SUPPORTED THE RESOLUTION </p><p>CONDEMNING THE INVASION OF PANAMA IN DECEMBER, MAINLY </p><p>ITS HISTORICAL OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF FORCE.  CANADA </p><p>CONDEMNED THE "BRUTAL IRAQI AGGRESSION" AND URGED THAT </p><p>THE "INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE BE CLEAR AND VIGOROUS." </p><p>FRANCE "UNRESERVEDLY CONDEMNED THE INVASION" WHILE </p><p>MALAYSIA STATED THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF NON-AGGRESSION IN </p><p>THE CHARTER WERE "SACROSANCT".  THE U.K. PERMREP, </p><p>REMARKING ON THIS "UGLY MOMENT IN WORLD AFFAIRS", SAID </p><p>THE "FULL-SCALE INVASION OF A SMALL AND VULNERABLE </p><p>NEIGHBOR BY IRAQ WAS A BREACH OF THE CHARTERS OF BOTH </p><p>THE UN AND THE ARAB LEAGUE."  HE WENT ON TO CONDEMN THE </p><p>"PHONY COUP D\'ETAT, INVASION AND PUPPET GOVERNMENT" AND </p><p>URGED THE SC TO PROTECT "THE SMALL, VULNERABLE AND </p><p>DEFENSELESS."  FINLAND, THE SOVIET UNION, CHINA AND </p><p>ROMANIA ADDED THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN AND </p><p>CONDEMNATIONS OF THE IRAQI INVASION. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THE SESSION WAS DELAYED BY THE INDECISION OF </p><p>YEMEN REGARDING ITS VOTE ON THE RESOLUTION.  THE NAM </p><p>CAUCUSED SEVERAL TIMES AND ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO SUPPORT </p><p>THE RESOLUTION, LEAVING YEMEN THE ALTERNATIVE OF </p><p>ABSTAINING.  IN THE EVENT, YEMEN CHOSE NOT TO ABSTAIN, </p><p>BUT RATHER NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEBATE AND VOTE. </p><p>THE YEMENI PERMREP EXPLAINED THIS DECISION BY HIS LACK </p><p>OF INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIS CAPITAL, BUT EXPRESSED HIS </p><p>SORROW AND EMBARRASSMENT THAT THE ISSUE INVOLVED TWO </p><p>ARAB COUNTRIES, BOTH MEMBERS OF THE ARAB LEAGUE, AND HE </p><p>ASSERTED THE NEED FOR STATES TO RESPECT EACH OTHER\'S </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY AND AVOID THE USE OF FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  THE U.S. WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN EIGHT CO-SPONSORS </p><p>OF THE RESOLUTION:  CANADA, COLOMBIA, COTE D\'IVOIRE, </p><p>ETHIOPIA, FINLAND, FRANCE, MALAYSIA, AND THE U.K.  USUN </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THE KUWAITI MISSION INFORMED OF </p><p>THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PICKERING </p><p></p></div>
