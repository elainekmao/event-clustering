<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 THE HAGUE 001794 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DRL/IL FOR CHRIS CAMILLO </p><p>DOL/ILAB FOR MARCIA EUGENIO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ELAB, EIND, PHUM, ETRD, SOCI, NL </p><p>SUBJECT: CHILD LABOR STUDY: REPORT ON THE NETHERLANDS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 100081 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  CHILD LABOR IS ILLEGAL IN THE NETHERLANDS.  THE COUNTRY </p><p>HAS COMPREHENSIVE LABOR AND SOCIAL LEGISLATION TO PROTECT </p><p>YOUNG PEOPLE AT WORK.  THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT TAKES A LEADING </p><p>ROLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHILD LABOR.  IN </p><p>MAY 2000, THE GON SENT A DRAFT LAW TO THE SECOND CHAMBER OF </p><p>THE DUTCH PARLIAMENT FOR DUTCH RATIFICATION OF ILO </p><p>CONVENTION 182 ON CHILD LABOR.  RATIFICATION IS EXPECTED </p><p>BEFORE THE END OF 2000.  DURING THE ILO NEGOTIATIONS, THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS ACTED AS COORDINATOR AND SPOKESPERSON FOR </p><p>INDUSTRIALIZED MARKET ECONOMY COUNTRIES (IMEC).  THE </p><p>NETHERLANDS ALSO ACTIVELY SUPPORTS THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM </p><p>ON THE ELIMINATION OF CHILD LABOR (ILO/IPEC). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>2.  THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FIGHT AIMED AT ELIMINATING ABUSIVE AND </p><p>EXPLOITATIVE CHILD LABOR AND PROMOTING PRIMARY EDUCATION FOR </p><p>CHILDREN.  THE DUTCH HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS LEADING UP TO THE ADOPTION OF ILO CONVENTION </p><p>182 IN JUNE 1999.  DUTCH RATIFICATION OF ILO CONVENTION 182 </p><p>IS EXPECTED BEFORE THE END OF 2000.  BETWEEN 1999 AND 2003, </p><p>THE NETHERLANDS WILL SPEND SOME FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PER </p><p>YEAR ON CHILD LABOR PROJECTS, INCLUDING ILO/IPEC PROJECTS. </p><p>THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE ILO\'S </p><p>STATISTICAL INFORMATION AND MONITORING PROGRAM ON CHILD </p><p>LABOR (SIMPOC). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NATIONAL EFFORTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p>3.  THE 1919 LABOR ACT PROHIBITS FORCED AND BONDED LABOR BY </p><p>CHILDREN IN THE NETHERLANDS, AND THIS PROHIBITION IS SHARPLY </p><p>ENFORCED.  THE MINIMUM AGE FOR EMPLOYMENT IS 16 YEARS, AND </p><p>FOR FULL-TIME WORK IT IS CONDITIONED ON COMPLETION OF THE </p><p>MANDATORY 12 YEARS OF SCHOOLING. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  HOLIDAY WORK AND AFTER-SCHOOL JOBS ARE TIED TO VERY </p><p>STRICT RULES, WHICH ARE SET IN THE WORK-TIME ACT, THE CHILD </p><p>LABOR REGULATION (FOR CHILDREN UNDER 16 YEARS), AND THE </p><p>WORKING CONDITIONS DECREE.  FOR INSTANCE, PEOPLE UNDER 18 </p><p>ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM WORKING AT NIGHT, OR IN AREAS </p><p>DANGEROUS TO THEIR PHYSICAL OR MENTAL WELL-BEING.  CHILDREN </p><p>OVER 12 YEARS ARE ALLOWED TO PERFORM SOME TYPES OF LABOR, AS </p><p>LONG AS THE WORK IS NOT DONE DURING SCHOOL HOURS, SUCH AS </p><p>WORK IN THE FRAMEWORK OF ALTERNATIVE SANCTIONS, LIGHT NON- </p><p>INDUSTRIAL WORK, LIGHT WORK IN CONNECTION WITH SCHOOL, AND </p><p>DELIVERING MORNING PAPERS.  OBSERVANCE OF THE RULES IS </p><p>CARRIED OUT BY THE DUTCH SOCIAL MINISTRY\'S LABOR INSPECTION </p><p>OFFICE.  DURING CONTROLS BY THE LABOR INSPECTION LAST </p><p>SUMMER, IT APPEARED THAT ONE OUT OF FOUR COMPANIES HAD </p><p>VIOLATED THE REGULATIONS APPLYING TO HOLIDAY WORK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDUCATION </p><p>--------- </p><p>5.  BASIC EDUCATION IS FREE FOR CHILDREN BETWEEN 4 AND 12, </p><p>ALTHOUGH SCHOOLS MAY ASK FOR A VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION FROM </p><p>PARENTS.  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IS ALSO FREE, EXCEPT FOR </p><p>COSTS OF SCHOOLBOOKS.  MANDATORY ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOLS ENDS </p><p>AT 16, OR AFTER AT LEAST 12 YEARS OF EDUCATION.  CHILDREN </p><p>ILLEGALLY RESIDING IN THE NETHERLANDS ARE ALSO UNDER THE </p><p>MANDATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CHILD SOLDIERS </p><p>-------------- </p><p>6.  THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT RECENTLY DECIDED NOT TO RAISE THE </p><p>MINIMUM RECRUITMENT AGE FOR THE DUTCH MILITARY TO 18, </p><p>DESPITE HEAVY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE.  THE </p><p>MINIMUM AGE FOR RECRUITMENT IS STILL 17, BUT SOLDIERS MUST </p><p>BE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD TO PARTICIPATE IN COMBAT.  THEY ARE </p><p>NOT SENT ABROAD UNTIL AGE 18. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SEXUAL ABUSE </p><p>------------ </p><p>7.  INTERNATIONAL SEX TOURISM INVOLVING THE ABUSE OF MINOR </p><p>CHILDREN IS PROSECUTABLE.  THE AGE OF CONSENT IS 16.  THE </p><p>PROSECUTION OF ADULTS FOR SEX WITH MINORS BETWEEN THE AGES </p><p>OF 12 AND 16 ONLY OCCURS WHEN A COMPLAINT IS FILED BY AN </p><p>INTERESTED PARTY.  IN 1996, THE NETHERLANDS TIGHTENED ITS </p><p>CRIMINAL LAW, QUALIFYING AS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE NOT ONLY THE </p><p>PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF CHILD PORN, BUT ALSO </p><p>MERE POSSESSION.  THE MAXIMUM PENALTY FOR SUCH OFFENSES WAS </p><p>RAISED FROM 3 MONTHS TO FOUR YEARS IMPRISONMENT, SIX YEARS </p><p>IN THE EVENT OF FINANCIAL GAIN, AND THE MAXIMUM FINE WAS </p><p>MORE THAN TRIPLED.  THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN PRIORITY </p><p>TO FIGHTING THE PROBLEM OF TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN AND </p><p>CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NGO ACTIONS </p><p>----------- </p><p>8.  DUTCH TRADE UNION FEDERATIONS AND OTHER NGOS ARE VERY </p><p>ACTIVE IN THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHILD LABOR.  THE FNV, THE </p><p>LARGEST DUTCH TRADE UNION FEDERATION WITH MORE THAN 1.2 </p><p>MILLION MEMBERS, TAKES A LEADING ROLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN.  THE </p><p>FNV SUPPORTS INTERNATIONAL TRADE UNION PROJECTS AGAINST </p><p>CHILD LABOR.  IT CONTRIBUTES TO PROJECTS IN INDIA, PAKISTAN, </p><p>BANGLADESH, NEPAL AND THE PHILIPPINES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE FNV AND OTHER NGOS, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS, CONSUMER AND WOMEN\'S GROUPS, AND THE FAIR </p><p>TRADE ORGANIZATION, HAVE INITIATED THE "CLEAN CLOTHES" </p><p>CAMPAIGN, WHICH SEEKS TO IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS IN THE </p><p>CLOTHING INDUSTRY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE "CLEAN CLOTHES" CAMPAIGN HAS USED THE EUROPEAN </p><p>SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP, CURRENTLY BEING HELD IN THE NETHERLANDS </p><p>AND BELGIUM, AS A PLATFORM TO PROTEST THE BAD LABOR </p><p>CONDITIONS IN COMPANIES PRODUCING SPORT SHOES, CLOTHES AND </p><p>FOOTBALLS.  FOR INSTANCE, THIS YEAR, THE FNV AND THE DUTCH </p><p>ALTERNATIVE CONSUMER ASSOCIATION STAGED PROTEST ACTIONS </p><p>DURING A NIKE SHAREHOLDERS MEETING AND DURING A RACE </p><p>SPONSORED BY NEW BALANCE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  THERE IS STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE DUTCH FOR THE USE OF </p><p>LABELS ON FOODS AND OTHER PRODUCTS (E.G., RUGMARK AND FAIR </p><p>TRADE LABELS) SHOWING THAT PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED WITHOUT </p><p>CHILD LABOR AND FOR FAIR WAGES.  FAIR TRADE SHOPS SPECIALIZE </p><p>IN SUCH PRODUCTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2000, THE DUTCH CLOTHING </p><p>CONCERN "WE INTERNATIONAL" ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL DEMAND </p><p>FROM ITS SUPPLIERS THE GUARANTEE THAT ALL "WE" CLOTHES ARE </p><p>MADE WITHOUT CHILD LABOR, FORCED LABOR, DISCRIMINATION, AND </p><p>UNDER HEALTHY AND SAFE LABOR CONDITIONS, USING THE "SOCIAL </p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY (SA) 8000 STANDARD."  OTHER CLOTHING </p><p>COMPANIES IN THE NETHERLANDS, INCLUDING C&A STORES, HAVE </p><p>ESTABLISHED THEIR OWN CODE OF CONDUCT. </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
