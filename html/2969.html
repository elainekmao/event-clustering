<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002475 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>S/ES-O FOR UNDER SECRETARY LARSON OOB 5/20 </p><p>TREASURY FOR UNDER SECRETARY TAYLOR AND MICHAEL KAPLAN </p><p>NSC FOR GARY EDSON/CLAY LOWERY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/20/2007 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: IMF MISSION VIEWS ON JORDAN DEBT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Summary.  IMF staff currently in Amman says that </p><p>Jordan needs a new Fund program that will allow it to </p><p>"refinace" its Paris Club debt in such a way as to guarantee </p><p>its graduation from the IMF process.  Given its low credit </p><p>rating and volatile neighborhood, Jordan does not have </p><p>market-based alternatives.  Being by far the largest </p><p>creditor, Japanese support for such a refinancing is </p><p>critical.  The IMF\'s points will be spelled out in staff </p><p>papers to be issued following the May 23 end of its current </p><p>mission to Amman. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  According to Ihsan Mansur, the leader of the IMF </p><p>mission that is currently in Amman to negotiate a new IMF </p><p>program, the IMF\'s timeline remains to have a new 2-year, </p><p>$105 million (SDR 85 million) stand-by program approved by </p><p>the IMF in July, followed immediately thereafter by a Paris </p><p>Club negotiation.  Mansur said the mission should wrap-up on </p><p>May 22 or 23 with a press conference.  The new director of </p><p>the IMF\'s Middle East department, George Abed, would fly in </p><p>to seal the deal on the new program and deal with the press. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  Mansur said that this agreement would mark Jordan\'s </p><p>"graduation" from the IMF.  Thus, Mansur stressed to Econ </p><p>chief, Jordan needs a Paris Club agreement that will allow it </p><p>to "refinance" its external debt in such a way that it will </p><p>never need to return to the Paris Club (i.e. the </p><p>"reprofiling" the Jordanians are seeking).  He said that if </p><p>Jordan does not obtain this refinancing, it will have to </p><p>borrow from the market at high interest rates.  This, plus </p><p>short market maturities, would leave Jordan financially </p><p>vulnerable to external events and periodic rollover crises. </p><p>These could be associated with political uncertainties in </p><p>Jordan\'s volatile "neighborhood."  All this, Mansur said, </p><p>increases the likelihood of a future debt or payments crisis </p><p>absent a refinancing (he cited Turkey and Lebanon as negative </p><p>examples). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  Mansur also stressed the importance of Japan\'s </p><p>support for such an approach, since it is by far the largest </p><p>creditor and has the highest interest rates on its debt </p><p>(relative to market rates).  They stressed that even if it is </p><p>willing to follow such an approach on its own debt, Japan </p><p>needs the multilateral cover of the Paris Club to take </p><p>action.  A member of the IMF mission with experience in Japan </p><p>described how it would create domestic political problems for </p><p>the Japanese to be seen as acting alone. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  Comment:  Mansur said that the IMF\'s financial </p><p>points would be spelled out in the staff papers that would be </p><p>distributed following the visit, but that it was up to </p><p>creditors to find the most appropriate mechanisms to meet </p><p>Jordan\'s needs.  Jordan\'s limited access to market finance </p><p>was highlighted by Standard and Poor\'s April 30 decision to </p><p>remove its "positive" outlook on Jordan\'s "BB-" credit </p><p>rating.  Recognizing Jordan\'s success in implementing </p><p>economic reforms, S and P cited the uncertain regional </p><p>situation as the main factor in its decision.  The rating is </p><p>now exactly at the same level as it was at the beginning of </p><p>Jordan\'s current IMF program, before it joined the WTO and </p><p>negotiated an FTA with the United States.  This suggests that </p><p>Jordan does not yet have a meaningful, affordable alternative </p><p>to the Paris Club for dealing with its medium-long term debt </p><p>exposure. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
