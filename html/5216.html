<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000154 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR PD/WHA (MBUCKLEY); IIP/G/WHA DIPASQUALE; EB/EPPD DCLUNE; </p><p>USTR AGASH </p><p>INFO IIP/T/ES </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, IOs, </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KPAO, HO, PA, ETRD, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: "CAFTA" AETN Program with Barbara </p><p>Bowie Whitman </p><p> </p><p>1. January 16 "La Tribuna," Liberal Party Tegucigalpa-based </p><p>daily, carried an article on CAFTA with the headline "U.S. </p><p>proposes to reinforce security at Central American Ports". </p><p> </p><p>2. "Tiempo," San Pedro Sula-based liberal paper owned by </p><p>businessman and congressional deputy Jaime Rosenthal, </p><p>carried a half-page story: "In CAFTA the U.S. goal is </p><p>lowering subsides in 15 years." </p><p> </p><p>3. "El Heraldo," moderate Tegucigalpa-based daily, carried a </p><p>half-page article entitled "U.S. won\'t eliminate all </p><p>agricultural subsidies."  The story focused on the U.S. call </p><p>for a worldwide reduction in subsidies". </p><p> </p><p>4. National TV and radio news programs gave full coverage to </p><p>the CAFTA program.  Nation-wide radio station Radio America </p><p>did a live transmission and retransmitted the entire program </p><p>on its nightly news. </p><p> </p><p>6. An editorial in "La Tribuna," 1/12/03, was entitled: </p><p>"Inch by Inch" "Representatives and Negotiators from the </p><p>Honduran Council for Private Enterprise said that Honduras </p><p>is not prepared for CAFTA. On the other hand the Costa Rican </p><p>and El Salvadoran economies are well poised to take </p><p>advantage of CAFTA." </p><p> </p><p>"As for Honduras and Nicaragua, their agricultural sectors </p><p>are more sensitive than countries with economies that have a </p><p>more developed economic system. Does the negotiation team </p><p>have the necessary qualified people who can meet the </p><p>challenges of CAFTA?  And prior to beginning negotiations, </p><p>has the government consulted with the other sectors to </p><p>present a consensus position at the negotiation table?  From </p><p>here, it looks as if no one is in a hurry to workout a </p><p>national position on this important issue that will </p><p>determine our economic and commercial future." </p><p> </p><p>"The fact is, we are lagging behind the process waiting </p><p>until someone else raises an issue or take action. We </p><p>remember that during the NAFTA negotiations with Mexico and </p><p>the Dominican Republic (sic), while other countries were </p><p>taking strong positions and fighting over every inch, here </p><p>everything was off the rails. </p><p> </p><p>7. Editorial in "El Heraldo" 1/12/03 entitled: "Honduras and </p><p>the Free Trade Agreement with the U.S."- "Since the Summit </p><p>meeting in 1994, the process for toward an FTAA has moved </p><p>forward silently, but unceasingly. Honduras along with other </p><p>countries has been involved in this process. But it is clear </p><p>that Honduras and Nicaragua are the two countries in the </p><p>region with the weakest economies when you compare them to </p><p>Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica." </p><p> </p><p>"But we are still have time to recover, if we are able to </p><p>strengthen the fragile economic bases, diversify and make </p><p>the economy more efficient, and emphasize our competitive </p><p>advantages -labor and nearness to U.S. Atlantic ports. But </p><p>these factors are not enough; we need a united position </p><p>among government, the private sector and labor." </p><p> </p><p>"It is necessary to eliminate corruption, end the delays in </p><p>legal procedures, offer legal and physical security, create </p><p>new dynamic opportunities, improve infrastructure, and train </p><p>the negotiation team. And only if we forgo both national and </p><p>special interest concerns can we hope to succeed within the </p><p>regional block. Otherwise we will be condemned to be just a </p><p>small consumer of foreign products and services." </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
