<p>UNCLAS STATE 229052 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: CVIS </p><p>SUBJECT: PASSAGE OF VWP LEGISLATION: WHERE DO WE GO FROM </p><p>HERE? </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 210639 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY: THE PRESIDENT SIGNED LEGISLATION MAKING THE </p><p>VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM PERMANENT. SEVERAL COUNTRIES </p><p>HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN BECOMING VWP PARTICIPANTS, AND </p><p>SEVERAL POSTS HAVE OFFERED SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGES TO THE </p><p>PROGRAM. GIVEN THE EXTENSIVE PREPARATORY WORK AND </p><p>COMPROMISE NEEDED TO OBTAIN A PERMANENT VISA WAIVER </p><p>PROGRAM, THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT ENVISION REQUESTING ANY </p><p>ADDITIONAL STATUTORY CHANGES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. THE DEPARTMENT INFORMED THE FIELD IN REFTEL THAT THE </p><p>PRESIDENT HAD SIGNED HR 3767, THE VISA WAIVER PERMANENT </p><p>PROGRAM ACT. THIS LEGISLATION MADE THE VISA WAIVER PILOT </p><p>PROGRAM (VWPP) A PERMANENT PROGRAM, NOW KNOWN AS THE VISA </p><p>WAIVER PROGRAM (VWP). THE PRESIDENT\'S SIGNATURE WAS THE </p><p>CULMINATION OF A LONG PROCESS IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT, </p><p>OTHER AGENCIES, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THEIR STAFFS MADE </p><p> </p><p>KNOWN THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND WHAT CHANGES </p><p>THEY WANTED IN THE STATUTE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>FURTHER CHANGES TO VWP LEGISLATION </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. AS POSTS WERE ABLE TO SURMISE BASED ON THE SEVERAL </p><p>EXTENSIONS OF THE PAROLE PROCEDURE FOR NATIONALS OF WAIVER </p><p>COUNTRIES AFTER VWPP AUTHORITY EXPIRED ON APRIL 30, </p><p>PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO EXTEND OR MAKE PERMANENT THE </p><p>VWPP WAS A CLIFFHANGER. THE FATE OF THE PROGRAM RISKED </p><p>BEING LEFT FOR AN END-OF-SESSION OMNIBUS WHERE ANYTHING </p><p>CAN HAPPEN. PASSAGE OF THE BILL REQUIRED A CONCERTED AND </p><p>COORDINATED EFFORT BY SEVERAL OFFICES IN THE DEPARTMENT, </p><p>PARTICULARLY IN THE BUREAU OF CONSULAR AFFAIRS, TO KEEP </p><p>THE BILL MOVING, TO MINIMIZE UNWANTED AMENDMENTS, AND TO </p><p>DEFLECT ATTEMPTS TO DERAIL OR MODIFY IT. </p><p> </p><p>4. AT THE OUTSET OF THE PROCESS, THE BUREAU OF CONSULAR </p><p>AFFAIRS WORKED CLOSELY WITH STAFF MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE </p><p>IMMIGRATION SUBCOMMITTEE, WHICH DRAFTED AND INTRODUCED THE </p><p>BILL, TO TRY TO GET IMPORTANT PROVISIONS INTO THE VWP </p><p>LEGISLATION, PARTICULARLY THOSE RAISED WITH US BY POSTS. </p><p>WHILE STAFF MEMBERS WERE SYMPATHETIC TO MANY OF OUR </p><p>REQUESTS, THE SUBCOMMITTEE WAS INUNDATED WITH SPECIAL </p><p>INTEREST REQUESTS FROM OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p>OUR INTERESTS, WHILE VIEWED SYMPATHETICALLY AND EVEN </p><p>FAVORABLY, WERE CAUGHT UP IN THE CAUSES OF EVERY GROUP </p><p>WITH ISSUES BEARING ON VWP. AS THE IMPORTANCE OF VWP </p><p>BECAME INCREASINGLY APPARENT ON THE HILL, THE BILL TURNED </p><p>INTO A "CHRISTMAS TREE," USED TO HANG ALL KINDS OF SPECIAL </p><p>INTEREST PROVISIONS, BOTH RELATED AND UNRELATED TO THE VWP </p><p>ITSELF. THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN PASSAGE OF AN EXTENSION OF </p><p>VWPP, LET ALONE A PERMANENT PROGRAM, WAS TO AVOID PRESSING </p><p>FOR FURTHER VARIATIONS. VWPP WAS SUFFICIENTLY </p><p>CONTROVERSIAL THAT ANY CHANGE OR ENHANCEMENT WAS HIGH RISK </p><p>-- THE RISK BEING LOSS OF THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>5. POSTS MAY ALSO BE AWARE THAT GREECE\'S STATUS IN THE VWP </p><p>WAS A SOURCE OF CONCERN FOR SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT WAS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TO CONGRESS ALL OF THE </p><p>DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE NOMINATION OF GREECE. CONGRESS </p><p>WAS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT ALL INTERESTED BUREAUS IN </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES HAD HAD AN OPPORTUNITY </p><p>TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS FULLY ON THE NOMINATION OF GREECE. </p><p> </p><p>AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MATERIAL WAS PROVIDED TO CONGRESS IN </p><p>THREE SEPARATE TRANCHES. </p><p> </p><p>6. THE DEPARTMENT IS OVERJOYED FINALLY TO HAVE A PERMANENT </p><p>VWP. NOW WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THE STATUTE, WHICH WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A DELICATE BALANCING OF MANY DIFFERENT </p><p>INTERESTS. THERE ARE NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO </p><p>CONGRESS, INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE ATTORNEY </p><p>GENERAL REVIEW EVERY VWP COUNTRY\'S PARTICIPATION AT LEAST </p><p>EVERY FIVE YEARS. REPORTS MUST ALSO BE MADE TO CONGRESS </p><p>ABOUT THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR </p><p>INCLUSION IN VWP. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ADDITIONAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES FOR DATASHARE WITH THE IMMIGRATION AND </p><p>NATURALIZATION SERVICE (INS) THROUGH THE USE OF </p><p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. </p><p> </p><p>7. OUR SENSE IS THAT CONGRESS INTENDS VERY FIRMLY TO LIMIT </p><p>THE VWP TO A SINGLE VISA CLASS WITH VERY STRICT </p><p>REQUIREMENTS AND TO MONITOR THE PROGRAM VERY CLOSELY. </p><p>GIVEN THIS IMPRESSION AND THE LACK OF APPARENT ENTHUSIASM </p><p>TO REOPEN THIS ISSUE ON THE HILL BY THOSE WHO WOULD </p><p>SUPPORT POSITIVE CHANGES, WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE </p><p>COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE TO SEEK FURTHER LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AT </p><p>THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>ADDING NEW COUNTRIES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. SOME POSTS HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED INTEREST IN </p><p>NOMINATING THEIR HOST COUNTRIES FOR VWP PARTICIPATION. </p><p>WHILE THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONSIDER ANY NOMINATIONS THAT WE </p><p>RECEIVE, WE MUST CAUTION POSTS NOT TO EXPECT A QUICK </p><p>RESPONSE. THE DEPARTMENT MUST CONSULT WITH THE </p><p>INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>OVERSEEING THE VWP TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW </p><p>REQUIREMENTS OF HR 3767. WE EXPECT THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>THE NEW REQUIREMENTS, REVISIONS TO THE NIV SOFTWARE TO </p><p>CAPTURE REFUSAL STATISTICS IN A DIFFERENT MANNER, REVIEW </p><p>OF THE CONSULAR CONSOLIDATED DATABASE TO DETERMINE IF ITS </p><p>OUTPUT MEETS OUR NEEDS, COORDINATION OF THE MANY NEW </p><p>REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND CONSULTATION WITH INS ON </p><p>DATASHARE WILL OCCUPY THE INTERAGENCY GROUP FOR SOME TIME. </p><p> </p><p>9. SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT THE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN THE VWP; I.E., EVEN THOUGH </p><p>THE NATIONALITIES INVOLVED ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSE IN THEIR </p><p> </p><p>ETHNIC MAKEUP THAN EVER BEFORE, IT IS STILL THE CASE THAT </p><p>22 OF THE 29 PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES ARE IN EUROPE. WE DO </p><p>NOT FORESEE THE ADDITION OF NEW COUNTRIES TO THE VWP IN </p><p>THE NEAR-TERM, SINCE WE DO NOT BELIEVE CONGRESS IS IN </p><p>FAVOR OF EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM. </p><p> </p><p>10. POSTS SHOULD CONTINUE TO REPORT THE HOST COUNTRY </p><p>NATIONAL (HCN) REFUSAL STATISTICS IF THEY BELIEVE THAT A </p><p>COUNTRY IS CLOSE TO MEETING, OR MEETS, THE REFUSAL RATE </p><p>CRITERION (NO MORE THAN A 3% REFUSAL RATE FOR HCNS </p><p>APPLYING FOR B VISAS, EXCLUDING 221(G) REFUSALS). THIS IS </p><p>REPORT 11E ON THE NIV SYSTEM. POSTS SHOULD SEND THE </p><p>REPORTS EVERY QUARTER VIA A CABLE SLUGGED FOR CA/VO/F/I. </p><p> </p><p>11. WE GENERALLY DO NOT RELEASE EXACT REFUSAL RATES. </p><p>SHOULD HOST GOVERNMENTS APPROACH POSTS WITH A REQUEST TO </p><p>PROVIDE THE "VWP REFUSAL RATE", WE RECOMMEND AGAINST </p><p>PROVIDING THE EXACT RATE. INSTEAD, POSTS SHOULD RESPOND </p><p>THAT REFUSAL RATES ARE MAINTAINED FOR INTERNAL DEPARTMENT </p><p>USE ONLY, AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL ADVISE THE HOST </p><p>COUNTRY (VIA POST) WHEN THE REFUSAL RATE AND OTHER INITIAL </p><p>CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET FOR NOMINATION PURPOSES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>INTERAGENCY NOMINATION AND APPROVAL PROCESS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. THE VWP NOMINATION PROCESS IS BASED ON A 1997 PROTOCOL </p><p>ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS OF STATE AND JUSTICE. </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS) INITIATES THE PROCESS BY </p><p>ADVISING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) OF ITS INTENT TO </p><p>NOMINATE A COUNTRY FOR CONSIDERATION FOR INCLUSION IN THE </p><p>VWP. ONCE DOS HAS ADVISED DOJ OF ITS INTENT TO NOMINATE A </p><p>COUNTRY, AN INTERAGENCY TEAM REVIEWS THE NOMINATION, </p><p>FOCUSING ON THE IMPACT INCLUSION OF THE COUNTRY IN VWP </p><p>WOULD HAVE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND </p><p>IMMIGRATION CONTROL. IF NO CLEARLY DISQUALIFYING </p><p>OBJECTIONS ARE RAISED DURING THIS PRENOMINATION REVIEW, </p><p>THE SECRETARY OF STATE SUBMITS A FORMAL WRITTEN NOMINATION </p><p>TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. </p><p> </p><p>13. AFTER A COUNTRY IS FORMALLY NOMINATED, INS LEADS A </p><p>SITE TEAM OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM INTERESTED AGENCIES TO </p><p>VISIT THE NOMINATED COUNTRY TO REVIEW PASSPORT AND </p><p>DOCUMENT SECURITY, BORDER AND IMMIGRATION CONTROLS, LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>CONDITIONS, AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT, IMMIGRATION, AND </p><p> </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS. BASED ON THE PRENOMINATION </p><p>REVIEW AND SITE VISIT, THE INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP </p><p>SUBMITS A RECOMMENDATION TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, IN WHOM </p><p>THE LAW VESTS ULTIMATE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE VWP </p><p>PARTICIPATION. </p><p>TALBOTT </p><p></p></div>
