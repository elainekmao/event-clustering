<p>UNCLAS ROME 004122 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MARR, U.S FORCES IN ITALY </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY STATIONING AND SOVEREIGNTY WORKING GROUP </p><p>MEETING MINUTES </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THE SEVENTH MEETING OF THE ITALY STATIONING AND </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY WORKING GROUP (ISSWOG) WAS HELD IN ROME ON MAY 7. </p><p> SENIOR US MILITARY OFFICIALS MET WITH EMBASSY ROME </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES TO DISCUSS ISSUES EFFECTING US PERSONNEL </p><p>STATIONED AT MILITARY FACILITIES IN ITALY.  PARTICIPANTS AND </p><p>AGENDA ITEMS ARE LISTED AT PARAGRAPH 32. </p><p> </p><p>ITALIAN POLITICAL OVERVIEW </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) THE DCM OPENED THE MEETING WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN POLITICAL SCENE. HE EMPHASIZED THE PRO-U.S. </p><p>TENDENCIES OF THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT BUT CAUTIONED THAT </p><p>ITALY,S COALITION POLITICS AND ITS PRO-EUROPE POLICIES MEAN </p><p>WE MUST HAVE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS.  THE U.S. WILL NOT </p><p>ALWAYS BE ABLE TO GET WHAT WE ASK FOR.  RESPECTING ITALY,S </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY REMAINS A CRUCIAL CONSIDERATION WHEN MAKING </p><p>REQUESTS OR DECISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) OTHER PARTICIPANTS ADDED THAT ISSWOG PROVIDES A USEFUL </p><p>OPPORTUNITY FOR GERMANY-BASED OFFICIALS TO HEAR PERSPECTIVES </p><p>FROM US AGENCIES IN ITALY THAT CAN SHAPE DECISIONS MADE IN </p><p>GERMANY.  SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF DOING BUSINESS ARE </p><p>SIMILAR IN ITALY AND IN GERMANY, AND SHARING INFORMATION AND </p><p>APPROACHES IS BENEFICIAL.  IN BOTH COUNTRIES, SOME ISSUES </p><p>REQUIRE A FEDERAL RESPONSE AND OTHERS ARE MORE CONSTRUCTIVELY </p><p>HANDLED AT A LOCAL LEVEL.  THE ITALIAN MILITARY OFTEN FACES </p><p>THE SAME POLITICAL LIMITATIONS AS THE US MILITARY.  WE NEED </p><p>TO KEEP THIS IN MIND, AND MAKE SURE OUR REQUESTS TO THE GOI </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04122  01 OF 05  221722Z </p><p>ARE REASONABLE, BALANCED AND EQUITABLE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) ISSWOG ALSO IMPROVES COORDINATION BETWEEN US MILITARY </p><p>AND EMBASSY OFFICIALS TO GIVE A MORE ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF </p><p>WHAT THE GOI IS DOING IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION ENDURING </p><p>FREEDOM (OEF) AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE WAR ON TERRORISM. </p><p>EUCOM CAN THEN PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO CENTCOM, WHICH CAN </p><p>PASS IT ON TO THE CONGRESS.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT A DOLLAR </p><p>VALUE ON ITALIAN SUPPORT, SUCH AS MOBILIZING THE GARIBALDI </p><p>AIRCRAFT CARRIER, FOREGONE RENT, AFNS FREQUENCY ALLOCATIONS, </p><p>OR CARABINIERI SUPPORT.  BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACCURATELY </p><p>REFLECT THE WIDE RANGE OF CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ITALY IS AND HAS </p><p>BEEN PROVIDING TO THE USG. </p><p> </p><p>BASING VISION UPDATE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>5. (SBU) THE JCS AND OSD ARE CONSOLIDATING ALL CINC BASING </p><p>STUDIES INTO ONE REPORT DUE DECEMBER 2002.  THE JROC OVERSEAS </p><p>PRESENCE STUDY, DUE OCTOBER 2002, WILL GIVE AN IDEA OF WHAT </p><p>THE DECEMBER REPORT WILL LOOK LIKE AND POSSIBLE </p><p>EUCOM-SPECIFIC CHANGES.  THE REPORTS ARE LIKELY TO EMPHASIZE </p><p>MORE JOINT BASING, AND TO RECOMMEND CONSOLIDATION OF </p><p>NONESSENTIAL INSTALLATIONS IN GERMANY WHERE POSSIBLE. </p><p>CENTRALIZING PEOPLE ONTO LARGER, CONSOLIDATED BASES WILL MAKE </p><p>IT MORE DIFFICULT TO BUILD RAPPORT AND POSITIVE CONNECTIONS </p><p>WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES.  THE US MILITARY WILL HAVE TO DO ANY </p><p>EVEN BETTER JOB OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH UNDER THESE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) NO BASES IN ITALY ARE BEING TARGETED FOR REALIGNMENT </p><p>AT THIS TIME.  THIS WILL BE REASSURING NEWS FOR THE GOI, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04122  01 OF 05  221722Z </p><p>WHICH HAS BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN THE US MILITARY,S </p><p>LONG-TERM PLANS FOR ITALY.  IT MIGHT MAKE DOING BUSINESS </p><p>EASIER IF THE GOI KNEW THAT THE US IS MAKING LONG-TERM </p><p>INVESTMENTS IN BASE IMPROVEMENTS IN ITALY.  FOR US MILITARY </p><p>PLANNING PURPOSES, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE PERIODIC </p><p>REPORTS BY EACH SERVICE THAT DETAIL EXPECTED FUTURE LAND </p><p>ACQUISITION NEEDS.  AT AN APPROPRIATE POINT, THAT INFORMATION </p><p>SHOULD BE SHARED WITH THE GOI. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) CAMP DARBY IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF AN EXISTING JOINT BASE </p><p>(AF, ARMY), WITH AVIANO, VICENZA AND DARBY FUNCTIONING AS A </p><p>JOINT OPERATION.  REPAIRS AT CAMP DARBY WILL LIKELY NEED TO </p><p>BE FUNDED BY THE USG BECAUSE NATO FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. </p><p>EUCOM IS WAITING FOR USAFE AND USAEUR SUGGESTIONS ON HOW BEST </p><p>TO USE THE FACILITY, WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO THE THEATRE AT </p><p>LARGE.  USAEUR HAS THE LEAD ON COMPILING A REPORT BY THE END </p><p>OF MAY 2002 ON WHERE THE SERVICES PREFER TO HAVE </p><p>PRE-POSITIONED STOCKS LOCATED.  THE DCM NOTED THAT, IF THE </p><p>MILITARY DECIDES TO CLOSE DARBY, IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO BE </p><p>CLEAR ABOUT WHY BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE A STRONG RESPONSE FROM </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5555 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04122  02 OF 05  221723Z </p><p>ACTION PM-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOTE-00  EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  UTED-00  TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  IRM-00   TEST-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------DCBE3A  221723Z /38 </p><p>R 221711Z AUG 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5540 </p><p>INFO SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE </p><p>NAS SIGONELLA IT </p><p>HQ MARFOREUR BOEBLINGEN GE </p><p>HQ EUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3-CI/ECJ23-H// </p><p>COMSIXTHFLT </p><p>COMFAIRMED NAPLES IT </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK </p><p>CDRUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE </p><p>CDR USASETAF VICENZA IT </p><p>CDR USAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE </p><p>16AF AVIANO AB IT </p><p>31FW AVIANO AB IT </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 05 ROME 004122 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MARR, IT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04122  02 OF 05  221723Z </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY STATIONING AND SOVEREIGNTY WORKING GROUP </p><p>MEETING MINUTES </p><p> </p><p>THE GOI. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) LA MADDALENA HAS SERVED AS AN IMPORTANT MAINTENANCE </p><p>SITE FOR THE EUROPEAN THEATRE FOR 28 YEARS.  THE NAVY HAS </p><p>DECIDED TO CONTINUE TO USE THE FACILITY FOR THE LONG-TERM, </p><p>BUT WANTS TO CONSOLIDATE OPERATIONS ONTO ONE PROPERTY INSTEAD </p><p>OF THE CURRENT 33 FACILITIES ON 17 SITES ON THREE ISLANDS. </p><p>THE CINC HAS SUBMITTED A REQUEST TO THE IDGS AND IS AWAITING </p><p>A RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) THE DCM ENCOURAGED PRODUCING A UNIFIED BASING STRATEGY </p><p>AMONG US MILITARY SERVICES WITHIN ITALY TO ENSURE THAT WHAT </p><p>WE DO AT ONE FACILITY DOESN,T INADVERTENTLY DISADVANTAGE </p><p>ANOTHER.  HE SUGGESTED THIS TOPIC BE UPDATED AT THE NEXT </p><p>ISSWOG MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>JMC REPORT AND INPUT </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>10. (U) JMC ORGANIZATION. FOLLOWING TWO USEFUL MEETINGS WITH </p><p>ITALIAN COUNTERPARTS, THE JOINT MILITARY COMMISSION (JMC) IS </p><p>WORKING EFFECTIVELY AND BEGINNING TO PRODUCE RESULTS. LOCAL </p><p>JMCS ARE BEING ORGANIZED TO ADDRESS LOCAL AND SHORT-TERM </p><p>ISSUES, INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING CIVILIAN COMMUNITIES. </p><p>BROADER ISSUES THAT ARISE WILL BE REFERRED TO THE FULL JMC, </p><p>WHICH CAN THEN PASS LONG-TERM, STRATEGIC BILATERAL ISSUES TO </p><p>THE ISSWOG FOR CONSIDERATION AS NECESSARY.  THE JMC IS A </p><p>MIL-MIL FORUM; THE ISSWOG WILL HANDLE THE POL-MIL ISSUES THAT </p><p>ARISE.  PARTICIPANTS NOTED THAT, WHEN USG PLANS AND PROPOSALS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04122  02 OF 05  221723Z </p><p>ARE FIRST DISCUSSED AT THE JMC (AFTER BEING VETTED BY US </p><p>COMPONENTS), THEY TEND TO BE BETTER RECEIVED BY ITALIAN </p><p>COUNTERPARTS BECAUSE THEY ARE APT TO BE SEEN AS A JOINT </p><p>DECISION TO PROCEED.  IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE JMC HAS THE </p><p>AUTHORITY TO TAKE ACTION AND DECISIONS ON THOSE ISSUES WITHIN </p><p>ITS PURVIEW. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) TECHNICAL ARRANGEMENTS (TAS): GENERAL PETROSKY </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT HE HAS AUTHORIZED THE JMC CHAIRMAN TO SIGN THE </p><p>TAS ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN COORDINATED WITH ALL SERVICES AND </p><p>LEGAL ADVISORS.  THE ITALIAN JMC CO-CHAIR ALREADY HAS THIS </p><p>AUTHORITY. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) SIGONELLA TA: ODC REPORTED THAT THE SIGONELLA TA IS </p><p>ABOUT 85% COMPLETE.  BOTH ITALY AND THE US WANT THE SIG TA </p><p>SIGNED; GEN. COCCOZZA, THE ITALIAN CO-CHAIR OF THE JMC, MADE </p><p>IT CLEAR AT THE JMC MEETING THAT THE GOI DOES NOT WANT TO </p><p>RENEGOTIATE EXISTING AGREEMENTS.  DISCUSSIONS ARE MOVING </p><p>FORWARD, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON RECONCILING THE US NEED FOR </p><p>FLEXIBILITY (AS PROVIDED UNDER THE SHELL AGREEMENT) AND THE </p><p>ITALIAN PREFERENCE FOR ELIMINATING AMBIGUITIES WHERE </p><p>POSSIBLE.  PARTICIPANTS AGREED THAT OPENING BROAD </p><p>RENEGOTIATIONS WOULD LIKELY JEOPARDIZE ADVANTAGES THAT EXIST </p><p>UNDER THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENT.  THE MORE SPECIFIC THE SHELL </p><p>AGREEMENT AND ANNEXES BECOME, THE LESS FLEXIBLE AND USEFUL </p><p>THEY ARE IN RESPONDING TO NEW SITUATIONS AND NEEDS.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, DESPITE A MORE PRO-AMERICAN SLANT, PRIME MINISTER </p><p>BERLUSCONI HAS BEEN LESS HELPFUL AND MORE CAUTIOUS ON ISSUES </p><p>WITH DOMESTIC IMPACT, SUCH AS US MILITARY PRESENCE IN ITALY. </p><p>HE MAY NOT BE IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT SOME USG REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04122  02 OF 05  221723Z </p><p>13. (U) RESIDUAL VALUE: THE ITALIANS MAINTAIN THAT THE GOI </p><p>HAS NOT OFFICIALLY ACCEPTED RETURNED INFRASTRUCTURE UNTIL THE </p><p>VALUE HAS BEEN DETERMINED, IN PART DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>INHERITING REPAIR/MAINTENANCE COSTS AND COSTS OF SECURING THE </p><p>PROPERTY.  THEY WOULD LIKE TO NEGOTIATE SOME CHANGES IN ANNEX </p><p>B TO THE SHELL AGREEMENT TO CLARIFY THE PROCESS.  US SENDING </p><p>STATE REPRESENTATIVES POINTED OUT THAT, WHILE THE JMC CAN </p><p>INTERPRET ANNEX B, IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE AUTHORITY TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE CHANGES.  TO DO SO WOULD REQUIRE REVISED CIRCULAR </p><p>175 NEGOTIATING AUTHORITY.  MILITARY LAWYERS ARE REVIEWING </p><p>THE SCOPE OF EXISTING CIRCULAR 175 AUTHORITY, WHICH WILL BE </p><p>USEFUL IN DEVELOPING PROCEDURES TO INTERPRET THE ANNEXES AND </p><p>SHELL AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) JMC CHAIR:  THE JMC RECOMMENDS THAT ADMIRAL MIKE </p><p>HOLMES SUCCEED GENERAL WAGNER AS THE US JMC CHAIR.  THE AIR </p><p>FORCE CONCURS.  THE NEXT JMC MEETING IS SCHEDULED FOR </p><p>SEPTEMBER AT SIGONELLA.  AN UPDATE ON JMC ACTIVITIES WILL BE </p><p>PROVIDED AT THE NEXT ISSWOG MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5558 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  04122  03 OF 05  221723Z </p><p>ACTION PM-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DOTE-00  EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  UTED-00  TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   L-00     DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  IRM-00   TEST-00  PMB-00   DRL-02   SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------DCBE44  221723Z /38 </p><p>R 221711Z AUG 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 5541 </p><p>INFO SECDEF WASHDC </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE </p><p>NAS SIGONELLA IT </p><p>HQ MARFOREUR BOEBLINGEN GE </p><p>HQ EUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3-CI/ECJ23-H// </p><p>COMSIXTHFLT </p><p>COMFAIRMED NAPLES IT </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK </p><p>CDRUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE </p><p>CDR USASETAF VICENZA IT </p><p>CDR USAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE </p><p>16AF AVIANO AB IT </p><p>31FW AVIANO AB IT </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 05 ROME 004122 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MARR, IT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  04122  03 OF 05  221723Z </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY STATIONING AND SOVEREIGNTY WORKING GROUP </p><p>MEETING MINUTES </p><p> </p><p>FORCE PROTECTION </p><p>---------------- </p><p>15. (U) THE FORCE PROTECTION WORKING GROUP MET IN AUGUST </p><p>2001, BEFORE THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, TO EXAMINE US FORCE </p><p>PROTECTION NEEDS IN ITALY.  ADM. HOLMES REPORTED THAT THE US </p><p>NAVY HAS SIGNED A FP MOU WITH SPAIN TO FORMALIZE EXISTING FP </p><p>MEASURES.  A SIMILAR MOU WITH ITALY HAS BEEN FORWARDED IN </p><p>DRAFT TO CINCUSNAVEUR FOR VETTING (BY END OF MAY).  ONCE </p><p>OTHER SERVICES IN ITALY HAVE REVIEWED THE MOU, IT WILL GO TO </p><p>THE EMBASSY FOR REVIEW AND THEN TO THE JMC AND ISSWOG. </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) WHILE THE SPANISH MOU COVERS US SHIPS AT MILITARY </p><p>FACILITIES AND NOT AT COMMERCIAL PORTS, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE </p><p>MAJORITY IN ITALY, THE SPANISH TEMPLATE IS A USEFUL STARTING </p><p>POINT.  KEEPING THE FLEXIBILITY THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IS </p><p>CRUCIAL; AN MOU THAT CREATES A NATIONAL POLICY THAT REDUCES </p><p>FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO EACH FACILITY,S PARTICULAR NEEDS </p><p>WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THE FPWG CAN REVIEW THE DRAFT MOU </p><p>AT ITS NEXT MEETING AND EVALUATE WHETHER A SERVICE BY SERVICE </p><p>MOU WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) PARTICIPANTS AGREED THAT THE GOI IS FULFILLING ITS FP </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES AND MEETING USG FP REQUIREMENTS.  THE </p><p>ITALIANS TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO </p><p>TEST THE SYSTEM; SOMEONE IS LIKELY TO BE FIRED IF A WEAKNESS </p><p>IS DISCOVERED DURING A TEST. </p><p> </p><p>18. (U) COVER LICENSE PLATE INITIATIVE.  SENDING STATE HAS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04122  03 OF 05  221723Z </p><p>WORKED WITH MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND MINISTRY OF </p><p>TRANSPORTATION CONTACTS TO AMEND ITALIAN LAW TO ALLOCATE 5000 </p><p>LICENSE PLATES TO THE US MILITARY TO MANAGE AND DISTRIBUTE </p><p>APPROPRIATELY.  AS OF MAY 3, THE BILL CONTAINING THE </p><p>AMENDMENT HAD BEEN APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND </p><p>IS WITH THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  ONCE THE BILL HAS BEEN </p><p>PASSED, SENDING STATE WILL WORK WITH THE GOI ON IMPLEMENTING </p><p>REGULATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) ACTION ON FORCE PROTECTION TOPIC FOR THE NEXT ISSWOG </p><p>MEETING: </p><p>--   THE FORCE PROTECTION WORKING GROUP WILL MEET AND REVIEW </p><p>THE DRAFT FP MOU PREPARED BY USN TO EVALUATE WHETHER A </p><p>SERVICE BY SERVICE MOU WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO ONE </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT.  UPDATE AT NEXT ISSWOG. </p><p>--  SENDING STATE WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK PROGRESS OF </p><p>LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENT AND WILL WORK ON IMPLEMENTING </p><p>REGULATIONS.  UPDATE AT NEXT ISSWOG. </p><p> </p><p>AFNS </p><p>---- </p><p>20. (SBU) ISSWOG PARTICIPANTS COMMENDED THE JMC FOR MAKING </p><p>GREAT PROGRESS ON RESOLVING THE DISPUTE WITH ITALY OVER </p><p>FREQUENCY ALLOCATION AND BROADCAST OF AFNS; FURTHER PROOF </p><p>THAT THE JMC IS A USEFUL BODY FOR RESOLVING ISSUES.  GENERAL </p><p>COCOZZA HAS NOT YET RESPONDED TO GENERAL WAGNER,S LETTER </p><p>REQUESTING A TWO YEAR EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT FREQUENCY </p><p>ALLOCATION.  THIS IS LIKELY TO BE THE LAST TIME THE IDGS WILL </p><p>LOAN THE FREQUENCY BECAUSE THE GOI NEEDS TO PROVIDE </p><p>FREQUENCIES TO ITALIAN FIRE, POLICE, ETC.  IF NO RESPONSE IS </p><p>RECEIVED BY SEPTEMBER, ODC AND POL-MIL WILL APPROACH THEIR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  04122  03 OF 05  221723Z </p><p>CONTACTS. </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) GENERAL RALSTON REQUESTED THAT OSD DEVELOP A </p><p>LONG-TERM SOLUTION, SUCH AS PURCHASING SATELLITES FOR </p><p>PERSONNEL.  OSD IS CONSIDERING THIS, ALONG WITH A FUNDING </p><p>REQUEST FOR $35 MILLION FOR EUROPE.  DOD LAWYERS AND THE </p><p>COMPTROLLER ARE CONCERNED ABOUT USING ONM MONEY FOR WHAT IS, </p><p>ESSENTIALLY, A PERSONAL PURCHASE.  J6 AND AFNS, DIRECTOR ARE </p><p>MEETING WITH THE LAWYERS AND COMPTROLLER.  FUNDING FOR </p><p>SATELLITE PURCHASES WILL BE A TOUGH SELL IN WASHINGTON. </p><p>EUCOM AGREED TO TALK WITH EUCOM PUBLIC AFFAIRS </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES ABOUT THEIR STRATEGY FOR SUPPORTING THIS </p><p>REQUEST: FORCE PROTECTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE ARE TWO </p><p>IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS UNDERLYING THE REQUEST FOR FUNDING. </p><p>ULTIMATELY, IF AFNS IS NOT ABLE TO REACH SERVICE PERSONNEL, </p><p>AFNS, REASON FOR BEING MAY BE QUESTIONED MORE FUNDAMENTALLY. </p><p> </p><p>22.

(U) AFTER 4 YEARS OF DELAY, MILNOISE TESTING AT AVIANO IS </p><p>MOVING FORWARD.  METHODOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ENSURE </p><p>THAT TESTS CONDUCTED WILL BE VALID ACCORDING TO STANDARDIZED </p><p>PROTOCOLS.
