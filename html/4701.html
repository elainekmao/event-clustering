<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 TEGUCIGALPA 003350 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR D, T, PM, WHA/PPC, WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/13/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MASS, MARR, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: CERRO LA MOLE RADAR--STILL AN UNREQUITED PACT </p><p> </p><p>REF: TEGUCIGALPA 01780 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolChief Francisco Palmieri, Reasons 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY:  Post reiterates the U.S. national interests </p><p>in fulfilling its obligations under the 1993 agreement with </p><p>the GOH regarding the maintenance of the radar located at </p><p>Cerro La Mole.  The U.S. agreed to pay 75% of all maintenance </p><p>costs up to a limit of $400,000 per year, while the GOH </p><p>agreed to pay 25% of the maintenance costs.  To date, the </p><p>U.S. has paid nothing under the agreement, while the GOH has </p><p>paid for all maintenance costs in excess of $800,000.  Post </p><p>recommends that the U.S. honor the spirit of the agreement by </p><p>either replacing it with a TPS-78 solid state version or with </p><p>another TPS-70, or repair the existing one.  In the wake of </p><p>the rapid Honduran accession to an Article 98 agreement, the </p><p>ongoing failure of the U.S. to fulfill its legal obligations </p><p>under the agreement is creating doubt about the U.S.\'s </p><p>commitment to international agreements at the very time we </p><p>are urging further Honduran cooperation.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>THE AGREEMENT </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In 1993 the U.S. and the GOH signed a Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding for the Expansion of the Radar Located in Cerro </p><p>La Mole in the Caribbean Basin Radar Network (MOU).  The </p><p>purpose of the MOU was to reaffirm the cooperation of the two </p><p>governments in the international battle against narcotics </p><p>trafficking by expanding the radar capability of the region </p><p>as set forth in the Caribbean Basin Radar Network agreement </p><p>(CBRN) signed by the U.S. and the GOH April 7, 1989.  The MOU </p><p>was designed to integrate the Cerro La Mole radar ("the </p><p>radar") into the operations of the CBRN. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The core provisions that are relevant to this </p><p>recommendation are as follows (NOTE: A more complete summary </p><p>of the core provisions of the MOU are found in Ref A. END </p><p>NOTE.): </p><p> </p><p>-The costs of operations and maintenance of the radar are to </p><p>be borne by the GOH. </p><p> </p><p>-The U.S. will have unrestricted access to the data from the </p><p>radar except in the case of a Honduran national emergency. </p><p> </p><p>-The U.S. will provide spare parts support and technical </p><p>assistance valued at a maximum of $400,000 per year, with the </p><p>GOH responsible for no less than 25 percent of the total </p><p>spare parts/technical assistance costs each year. </p><p> </p><p>-The MOU is effective until April 7, 2009. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>THE PROBLEMS OF NON-COMPLIANCE </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) There are a number of emerging diplomatic problems </p><p>due to the U.S.\'s failure to comply with the MOU.  The U.S. </p><p>has paid nothing under the terms of the MOU, while the GOH </p><p>has paid more than $800,000 in an attempt to maintain the </p><p>radar.  This is a source of tension between the Honduran </p><p>Armed Forces (HOAF) and the U.S. military personnel stationed </p><p>in Honduras.  Moreover, the situation has become a diplomatic </p><p>problem.  We understand that President Maduro had considered </p><p>raising it during the postponed visit of Secretary Powell in </p><p>October.  Ref A outlines the effects of the strained </p><p>relations that U.S. non-compliance has caused.  It is </p><p>difficult to ignore the GOH\'s argument that the agreement was </p><p>entered into between two sovereign nations, and that the U.S. </p><p>has a legal and moral obligation to abide by its terms. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The GOH is also raising the ante over the issue of </p><p>non-compliance.  Political and military relations are </p><p>becoming more and more bogged down with discussions about the </p><p>future of the MOU.  In a recent meeting between Ambassador </p><p>Palmer and Minister of Defense Fred Breve (MOD), when the </p><p>Ambassador discussed U.S. security assistance concerns, the </p><p>MOD responded by mentioning the U.S. failure to comply with </p><p>the MOU.  During the Conference of the Chiefs of the American </p><p>Air Forces, Colonel Ramos (Commander of the Honduran Air </p><p>Force), pressed General Jumper (Chief of Staff, U.S. Air </p><p>Force) for his support.  All political and military VIPs that </p><p>visit Honduras must field questions about our non-compliance. </p><p> MOD Breve raised it with WHA A/S Reich in August when the </p><p>A/S visited Honduras.  The situation has become increasingly </p><p>embarrassing for post and actually hampers productivity due </p><p>to the amount of time all mission military elements must </p><p>spend responding to HOAF questions.  Compliance with the MOU </p><p>would permit all country team elements to focus on more </p><p>important U.S. interests and priorities in Honduras, such as </p><p>working on counterterrorism and counterdrug training for the </p><p>HOAF, obtaining MOD support for counterterrorism treaties </p><p>languishing in Congress and designation of a GOH </p><p>counterterrorism coordinator. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR ARTICLE 98 </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The GOH recently signed an Article 98 agreement, </p><p>despite pressure from other Latin American countries to </p><p>decline.  Honduras was the first Central American country to </p><p>sign Article 98, and the Hondurans remain staunch supporters. </p><p> Post believes that the GOH should receive a tangible sign of </p><p>U.S. appreciation for signing the Article 98 agreement.  At </p><p>the recent USSOUTHCOM Security Assistance Conference (MILGP </p><p>Commanders\' Conference), Brigadier General Vincent Brooks, </p><p>Deputy Director, Pol Mil Affairs, WHEM, from Joint Staff J-5 </p><p>stated that our new approach would be the "carrot and the </p><p>stick"--in other words, the U.S. will help those countries </p><p>that sign Article 98 agreements and cut aid to those that do </p><p>not.  The radar issue is the U.S.\'s chance to demonstrate </p><p>that we will assist countries that support us on Article 98. </p><p>At the same conference, representatives from State and </p><p>Defense stated that U.S. interests are best served when each </p><p>country can best protect its own sovereignty.  The radar at </p><p>Cerro La Mole would enable Honduras to become a "full </p><p>partner" in the counterdrug and counterterrorism fights, </p><p>better protect its own sovereignty and allow for more </p><p>complete control of its airspace. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>SUPPORT FOR COUNTERDRUG/COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) More and more frequently, Honduran waters and air </p><p>space are used by narcotraffickers for transshipment of drugs </p><p>from Colombia to the U.S. and of illegal arms back to </p><p>Colombia.  Stopping this flow of arms to Colombian terrorist </p><p>groups is a direct and measurable contribution to the global </p><p>war on terrorism.  The U.S. regularly asks the GOH to assist </p><p>in the war against drugs.  The GOH has made a number of </p><p>strides in its counterdrug operations.  The Honduran Air </p><p>Force has begun to fly intercept missions, and maintains two </p><p>F-5s on fifteen-minute alert to scramble on counterdrug </p><p>flights.  Additionally, the Honduran Navy has returned at </p><p>least two patrol vessels to deep water service on the north </p><p>coast.  Honduras continues to grow as a transshipment zone </p><p>for illicit drugs, and the National Police are now having </p><p>some success in interdicting overland shipments.  An </p><p>operational TPS-70 at Cerro La Mole would allow the GOH to </p><p>become more fully engaged in regional counterdrug efforts, </p><p>since it would give Honduras the ability to track and pass </p><p>information to other governments in the region.  Drug </p><p>traffickers are increasingly exploiting the known hole in the </p><p>Cental American radar network to fly through the Cerro La </p><p>Mole radar coverage of the Honduras-Nicaragua-El Salvador </p><p>border areas. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Currently, the TPS-70 is non-operational and, </p><p>therefore, provides no intelligence directly to the U.S.  It </p><p>is part of SOUTHCOM\'s radar architecture, meaning it is tied </p><p>directly into our radar network.  A functional radar system </p><p>at Cerro La Mole would directly provide the U.S. a much </p><p>better view of Central America\'s illicit flights </p><p>(specifically, it would provide the U.S. with a means to </p><p>differentiate between friendly and unfriendly tracks provided </p><p>by the Relocatable Over the Horizon Radar (ROTHR) </p><p>system)--thus, buttresses the U.S. in its war against drugs. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>REGIONAL STABILITY </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) U.S. compliance with the MOU would ultimately </p><p>translate into increased regional stability by providing </p><p>Honduras with an increased capability for maintaining its </p><p>sovereignty.  Due to the geographical coverage of the radar, </p><p>it would provide advance warning of aggression against </p><p>Honduras, and thus provide a strong (yet peaceful) deterrent </p><p>to hostile military actions.  This would serve to reduce </p><p>misunderstandings between the Central American countries.  It </p><p>would also enhance identification of illicit flights skirting </p><p>the Honduras-Nicaragua-El Salvador border areas.  This has </p><p>become a serious problem because none of the three countries </p><p>can encroach on a 10-mile buffer zone along the borders under </p><p>terms of multi-national agreements.  A functioning TPS-70 may </p><p>lead to agreements among the three countries for better </p><p>cooperation in the buffer zones. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>HOAF EXPENDITURES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) During the last nine years, the GOH has spent more </p><p>than $800,000 to maintain the radar, but has lost the battle </p><p>in keeping it operational. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>ANSWERS TO OPPOSING ARGUMENTS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) There is stated DOD/SOLIC opposition to support for </p><p>this radar.  This mission contends the following--the </p><p>Hondurans are paying their fair share (paragraphs 4 and 10); </p><p>and, Cerro La Mole is now needed to improve radar collection </p><p>on a growing number of illicit drug flights that exploit the </p><p>Honduras-Nicaragua-El Salvador window (paragraphs 7 and 9). </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) We ask DOD/SOLIC to reconsider its previous position </p><p>and find a way to identify funds for this radar.  It is not </p><p>just the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do to </p><p>advance multiple U.S. interests in Central America. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>POST\'S RECOMMENDATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) Post recommends that the U.S. should immediately </p><p>begin honoring the MOU by either replacing the radar with a </p><p>solid state version (TPS-78) or with another TPS-70 </p><p>transferred from counterdrug programs.  This should be done </p><p>because we agreed to do so, to support counternarcotics </p><p>efforts in the region, and as a tangible sign of U.S. </p><p>appreciation to Honduras for its prompt signing of Article 98 </p><p>(the first in Central America). </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C) In the alternative, the U.S. could repair the radar </p><p>to operational status.  However, the radar is an older </p><p>300-series radar, and this approach may not be cost </p><p>effective.  Cost of replacement or repairs should be </p><p>evaluated to determine the most economical solution. </p><p>Moreover, post recommends that, pursuant to the MOU, the </p><p>radar be left in the control of the GOH, with all outputs </p><p>made available to the U.S. </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
