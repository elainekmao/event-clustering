(C) ON FEBRUARY 27, LABOFF MET WITH GEBRE </p><p>GEBREMARIAM, THE AMCIT REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE </p><p>AFL-CIO FUNDED AMERICAN CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL LABOR </p><p>SOLIDARITY IN HARARE, TO DISCUSS THE JUST-ENDED ZIMBABWE </p><p>CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS\' (ZCTU) FIVE-YEAR CONGRESS. </p><p>GEBREMARIAM INDICATED THAT THE ELECTION RESULTS AT THE </p><p>CONGRESS HAD PRODUCED A COMPLETE VICTORY BY THE MOVEMENT </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) IN MAINTAINING CONTROL OF </p><p>THE LABOR FEDERATION.  HE SAID THAT THE POLITICS </p><p>SURROUNDING THE ZCTU EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ELECTIONS </p><p>DOMINATED THE CONGRESS, AND THAT TRADITIONAL LABOR </p><p>ISSUES WERE CLEARLY SECONDARY.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>GEBREMARIAM, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE MDC COMMANDED </p><p>OVERWHELMING SUPPORT AMONG THE UNION DELEGATES WHO </p><p>ATTENDED THE CONGRESS.  IN HIS OPINION, AT LEAST 95 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE DELEGATES WERE VOCAL MDC SUPPORTERS, AND </p><p>THIS FIGURE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF MDC SUPPORT BY UNION </p><p>MEMBERS AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVELS.  HE EXPLAINED THAT </p><p>THIS SUPPORT IS NOT OPEN-ENDED AND WILL REQUIRE MDC </p><p>SUPPORT OF PRO-WORKER POLICIES, HOWEVER, ITS FIRM </p><p>FOUNDATION IS THE WIDESPREAD SENSE OF BETRAYAL AND </p><p>DISENCHANTMENT SHARED BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF UNION </p><p>MEMBERS TOWARDS PRESIDENT MUGABE AND ZANU-PF. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00862  01 OF 02  281850Z </p><p> </p><p>2.

THE PRO-MDC CANDIDATE </p><p>WILLARD CHIBHEBHE RECEIVED 81 VOTES, ANOTHER PRO-MDC </p><p>CANDIDATE GOT 36 VOTES, WHILE THE PRO-ZANU-PF CANDIDATE </p><p>ISIDORE ZINDOGA (WHO HAD BEEN ACTING SECRETARY GENERAL </p><p>FOR THE PAST 18 MONTHS) GARNERED JUST 35 VOTES. </p><p>GEBREMARIAM BELIEVES THAT ZINDOGA RECEIVED THESE VOTES </p><p>BECAUSE OF HIS SOLID CREDENTIALS AS A UNION ORGANIZER </p><p>AND NOT BECAUSE OF HIS PRO-ZANU-PF VIEWS, WHICH HE </p><p>PLAYED DOWN.  THE PRO-RULING PARTY CANDIDATE FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE ZCTU, SHANGWA CHIFAMBA, WHO DID NOT </p><p>DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM THE PARTY, RECEIVED ONLY A DISMAL </p><p>SEVEN VOTES OUT OF THE 152 CAST.  THE SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>MDC WAS ALSO SHOWN BY THE ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME THAT MDC </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND MDC VICE-PRESIDENT </p><p>GIBSON SIBANDA, BOTH FORMER UNION LEADERS, RECEIVED WHEN </p><p>THEY ADDRESSED THE CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) TRADITIONAL LABOR ISSUES AND OTHER ECONOMIC </p><p>MATTERS WERE RAISED AND DISCUSSED AT THE CONGRESS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO GEBREMARIAM, BUT IN ONLY A CURSORY MANNER. </p><p>THESE INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>= THE LEVEL OF DEATH, PENSION AND OTHER BENEFITS </p><p>  RECEIVED BY WORKERS FROM THE QUASI-GOVERNMENTAL </p><p>  NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (NSSA) </p><p> </p><p>= THE STATUS OF FUNDS RAISED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>  ZIMBABWE (GOZ) THROUGH THE AIDS LEVY TAX THAT IS PAID </p><p>  BY BOTH EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00862  01 OF 02  281850Z </p><p> </p><p>= RESTRUCTURING THE UNIONS IN ZIMBABWE TO CREATE FEWER, </p><p>  LARGER AND MORE POWERFUL UNIONS </p><p> </p><p>= THE PROBLEM OF RETRENCHMENT (LAYING OFF) OF WORKERS IN </p><p>  THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS </p><p> </p><p>= THE ISSUE OF PRIVATIZATION OF PARASTATAL ENTERPRISES </p><p>  AND THE EFFECT ON WORKERS </p><p> </p><p>= CREATING A SEPARATE ECONOMIC DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE </p><p>  ZCTU (OR AN AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH CENTER) TO PROVIDE </p><p>  INFORMATION ON THE ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p>= INCREASING UNION DUES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE </p><p>  FEDERATION\'S FINANCIAL SOLVENCY </p><p> </p><p>4.
