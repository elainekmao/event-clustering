TAX AND PENSION REFORM:  THE GOI IS AUTHORIZED TO </p><p>START WORK ON DRAFT REFORMS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>5. BERLUSCONI\'S ECONOMIC PROGRAM WAS ADVANCED BY THE </p><p>ENACTMENT OF THE 2002 BUDGET. DESPITE THE UNCERTAIN </p><p>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, THE GOI WAS ABLE TO GAIN APPROVAL OF A </p><p>STIMULUS PACKAGE AND AUTHORIZATION TO DRAFT REFORMS OF </p><p>THE TAX AND PENSION SYSTEMS. ONLY THE REFORM OF THE </p><p>BANKING FOUNDATIONS (REF D) CREATED SOME CONTROVERSY, </p><p>TRIGGERING TOUGH OPPOSITION FROM THE FOUNDATIONS </p><p>THEMSELVES AND CERTAIN CENTER-LEFT POLITICIANS. THIS AND </p><p>THE PARDON FOR ILLEGAL BUILDERS ON STATE PROPERTY ARE </p><p>EXAMPLES OF HOW THE BUDGET LAW CAN BE USED TO GAIN QUICK </p><p>PASSAGE OF CONTROVERSIAL LAWS WITHOUT A SERIOUS DEBATE IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT.  THE PARDON FOR ILLEGAL BUILDERS IS A </p><p>TRADITIONAL TYPE OF POLITICAL BENEFIT FOR VOTERS IN </p><p>SOUTHERN ITALY, WHERE SUCH ILLEGAL CONSTRUCTION IS </p><p>COMMON.  BERLUSCONI\'S COALITION, AND THE CDU/CCD IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, IS VERY STRONG IN SOUTHERN ITALY.
