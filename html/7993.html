(U) This cable contains an action request.  Please </p><p>see para 10. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Summary:  At a meeting to discuss the decision to </p><p>keep Turkey on the Special 301 Watch List, a Turkish </p><p>copyright official acknowledged increased copyright </p><p>piracy and outlined a series of steps to improve both </p><p>the legal/regulatory regime and enforcement.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Econoff and Econ Specialist met with Gunay </p><p>Gormez, of the Culture Ministry\'s Copyright Office, on </p><p>May 8 to deliver the Special 301 demarche for Turkey. </p><p>Gormez agreed that copyright piracy has worsened in some </p><p>areas, but outlined a series of measures that should </p><p>begin to turn this situation around. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Increased Piracy:  Gormez acknowledged a </p><p>general increase in pirated products in Turkish markets </p><p>over the last year.  She attributed this to:  1) </p><p>insufficient penalties for pirate producers, despite the </p><p>deterrent penalties included in the Copyright Law: </p><p>pirates have been assigned weaker penalties contained in </p><p>the older Cinema Law; 2) lack of training for the </p><p>judges, prosecutors, customs officers and for the </p><p>public; and 3) inadequate use of the provincial </p><p>copyright inspection units, caused by resource </p><p>shortages.  Pointing to the Business Software Alliance\' </p><p>success in cutting piracy in Turkey from 94 to 58 </p><p>percent over the last two years, Gormez opined that the </p><p>Ministry could achieve a sharp reduction in piracy in </p><p>other sectors by implementing the following measures: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) New Optical Media Regulation:  Gormez told us </p><p>the GOT had prepared a draft regulation calling for the </p><p>use of optical media codes in video and music products. </p><p>All recording facilities will be required to receive </p><p>authorization documents from the Ministry of Culture to </p><p>carry out their activities under this regulation, and to </p><p>use code numbers for all compact disks as a copyright </p><p>protection measure.  This should make it easier for the </p><p>law enforcement units and the Ministry of Culture to </p><p>detect pirated products, as well as the recording </p><p>facilities producing them.  The Ministry of Culture has </p><p>received favorable opinions from the professional unions </p><p>and other GOT agencies regarding this regulation and </p><p>hopes to issue it soon.  Econoff requested that Culture </p><p>provide us with a copy of the regulation as soon as </p><p>possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Registration Regulation:  Gormez reported that </p><p>the Ministry has developed a draft regulation on </p><p>mandatory/voluntary registration of copyright products. </p><p>Registration will be mandatory for musical and cinematic </p><p>works, and voluntary for others (such as some computer, </p><p>architecture and fashion designs).  The registration </p><p>system is to facilitate payment of royalties and </p><p>tracking of copyright. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Amendment to Cinema Law:  The Ministry is </p><p>preparing to amend the copyright-related parts of the </p><p>Cinema Law which will ensure that copyright violators </p><p>are subject to the more stringent penalties contained in </p><p>the Turkish copyright law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Training:  Gormez maintained that Culture </p><p>Ministry training for law enforcement officials dealing </p><p>with intellectual property will also help reduce piracy. </p><p>Last year, the Ministry briefed eight judges from </p><p>specialized intellectual property courts on copyright </p><p>protection.  These judges are currently on an EU- </p><p>financed, long-term training program in Europe.  The </p><p>Ministry is also planning to train Customs officers, </p><p>including at major border gates, and the provincial </p><p>copyright inspection teams.  The Ministry is working on </p><p>software to enable customs officers to check the </p><p>validity of banderoles for copyright products in </p><p>realtime.  Gormez added that the Culture Ministry has </p><p>received additional funds to support provincial </p><p>inspection units, and that law enforcement activities </p><p>will focus on Turkish resort areas during the summer </p><p>season. </p><p>9. (U) Embassy plans to meet with the Patent and </p><p>Trademark Institute on trademark piracy issues </p><p>identified in the Special 301 announcement in the near </p><p>future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Action Request for Department/USTR:  Please </p><p>provide Embassy with the text of model optical media </p><p>legislation, if available.  Pearson </p><p></p></div>
