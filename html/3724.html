<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 002675 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: DECL: 07/30/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VOTER REGISTRATION BEGINS SLOWLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASADOR HOWARD F.JETER. REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Voter registration began in Abuja </p><p>September 12 with little fanfare and not much of a </p><p>turnout. Previously postponed in July and August, </p><p>there was ample speculation the exercise would be </p><p>cancelled once more because of INEC\'s unpreparedness </p><p>and the injunction sought by unregistered political </p><p>parties. However, the lawsuit was decided in INEC\'s </p><p>favor, allowing registration to proceed. Poloff </p><p>observed registration at three local centers.  The </p><p>centers had sufficient registration materials but only </p><p>small numbers of people were queued to register. The </p><p>centers were poorly identified and difficult to </p><p>locate. On one level of analysis, that registration </p><p>began at all is welcome news. Yet, judging by what we </p><p>saw in Abuja, INEC was not fully prepared; a </p><p>significant portion of the first day and perhaps of </p><p>the next few days of this ten-day exercise will likely </p><p>be devoted  to concluding what should have been pre- </p><p>September 12 preparations. While some of the signs are </p><p>positive, this first day provided no clear indication </p><p>whether INEC can pull off a credible registration </p><p>exercise.   End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) For ten days (September 12-21), voter </p><p>registration is scheduled to take place  in  120,000 </p><p>centers throughout Nigeria. Centers are expected to </p><p>register 50 people a day for the entire period. Most </p><p>are open-air centers with no shelter. Poloff observed </p><p>the voter registration process at three centers in </p><p>Abuja.  There were no signs identifying the centers to </p><p>the general public. The sites  could only be picked </p><p>out by the small cluster of people gathered to </p><p>register. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The first center was inside a school compound; </p><p>once on campus, it took three inquiries to locate the </p><p>correct building. There were three registering </p><p>officials and representatives of the PDP and ANPP </p><p>present. At 1515, 24 people had been registered and </p><p>the process was taking 15 minutes per applicant. Only </p><p>three voters were waiting in line.  Poloff noticed </p><p>posters advertising the registration lying on the </p><p>floor but none had been displayed around the </p><p>neighborhood. The other centers visited had registered </p><p>45 and 112 people respectively. These two were easier </p><p>to find, because they were outside, but they were </p><p>likewise unmarked. A British High Commission (BHC) </p><p>Poloff found two out of three centers visited closed </p><p>due to rain, and the one that was open had relocated </p><p>to a nearby shelter. As with one of the sites observed </p><p>by Poloff, BHC Poloff found only two of the required </p><p>three officials present. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Although political party observers were mostly </p><p>pleased with the process there were complaints from </p><p>registrants that the centers were difficult to find. </p><p>They groused that a list of registration centers was </p><p>not available to the general public. The presiding </p><p>officials appeared to be conscientious; however, </p><p>inadequate infrastructure and equipment made it a very </p><p>difficult process. Information was first recorded </p><p>manually and then transferred to a computer readable </p><p>form.  Registrants were required to leave thumbprints </p><p>and then the thumb was marked with indelible ink (to </p><p>prevent multiple registrations).  A temporary card was </p><p>issued at the end of the process. (Note: INEC </p><p>guidelines originally required that the temporary </p><p>cards be laminated prior to issuance. Amended </p><p>requirements deleted this step.  Temporary cards </p><p>looked flimsy and easily damaged. End note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Poloff asked when permanent cards would be </p><p>issued. The officials replied only that there would be </p><p>an announcement when the cards were ready. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(U) Efforts to promote voter registration varied </p><p>across the country.  Media coverage was sparse as talk </p><p>of the presidential impeachment dominated the press. </p><p>Only a few radio advertisements promoting registration </p><p>were broadcast this week.  In Kano and Plateau States </p><p>September 12 and 13 were declared public holidays and </p><p>turnout appeared to be above the rate required per </p><p>polling sites. Turnout in Kaduna was reported as poor. </p><p>The Governor of Katsina  visited several centers to </p><p>encourage participation in his state. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Some governors reportedly threatened to </p><p>withhold salaries from civil servants who do not </p><p>register. (Note: Some of these states are already in </p><p>arrears of salary payments. The threat, to some </p><p>degree, is empty posturing for political purposes. </p><p>However, many governors want to maximize the number of </p><p>registered voters in their states. A larger pool of </p><p>voters translates into more political clout and the </p><p>potential for a larger share of federal funds down the </p><p>road. End Note.)  Osun, Ogun, Oyo, Edo and Bayelsa </p><p>States issued threats that September wages would be </p><p>paid upon presentation of a voter card.  The Nasarawa </p><p>State Governor purportedly told citizens that cards </p><p>would be required for medical treatment and school </p><p>admission.  Governor Ahmed Mu\'azu of Bauchi State </p><p>ordered senior government officials to return to their </p><p>places of origin in order to "aggressively mobilize </p><p>citizens to register." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.(C) The long awaited registration exercise was </p><p>greeted with relief. Its start was uncertain as late </p><p>as September 11. While our sampling of stations in </p><p>Abuja was not scientific we believe it was </p><p>sufficiently reflective of what happened in most of </p><p>Northern Nigeria. It showed that registration has </p><p>begun slowly and that INEC was not fully prepared. </p><p>Nevertheless, it was encouraging that centers were </p><p>open and that forms were available. The initial low </p><p>turnout was expected;  the turnout should rise over </p><p>the weekend and accelerate as the ten days progress. </p><p>Hopefully, information about the registration centers </p><p>will be better disseminated and their locations better </p><p>identified. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Given that ten days is a minimally adequate </p><p>time period to conduct registration in Nigeria, each </p><p>day it appears the pace of registration has been </p><p>slowed by INEC\'s lack of preparation lessens the </p><p>possibility that the exercise will be viewed as </p><p>successful by most Northern Nigerians. Many </p><p>Northerners already suspect INEC of trying to minimize </p><p>the numbers of voters registered in the North due to </p><p>the strong opposition to President Obasanjo that comes </p><p>from this region of the country. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
