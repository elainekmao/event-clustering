(SBU)  IN HIS REPLY TO SECRETARY POWELL\'S LETTER </p><p>REQUESTING A STRONG HOLY SEE STATEMENT REGARDING THE SAFETY </p><p>OF U.S. BIOTECH FOOD ASSISTANCE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA (REF B), </p><p>HOLY SEE FOREIGN MINISTER EQUIVALENT ARCHBISHOP JEAN-LOUIS </p><p>TAURAN GAVE NO INDICATION THAT THE HOLY SEE WOULD OFFER A </p><p>STRONG PUBLIC STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF U.S. FOOD ASSISTANCE, </p><p>BUT REAFFIRMED THAT THE VATICAN IS OPEN TO FULL ACCEPTANCE </p><p>OF BIOTECH FOOD TECHNOLOGY AFTER "PROPER" SCIENTIFIC STUDY. </p><p>FURTHERMORE, HE AGREED THAT BIOTECH FOODS SHOULD BE SHARED </p><p>WITH LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.  TAURAN\'S DEPUTY TOLD DCM </p><p>OCTOBER 3 THAT AS A RESULT OF THE LETTER, PAPAL NUNCIO\'S IN </p><p>THE REGION HAD BEEN PROVIDED THE CONCLUSIONS OF A 1998 STUDY </p><p>GROUP DOCUMENT OF THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE (WHICH WAS </p><p>GENERALLY POSITIVE TOWARD CONSUMPTION OF BIOTECH FOODS) AND </p><p>ASKED THAT THE NUNCIOS SHARE THIS WITH THE BISHOPS IN THE </p><p>REGION.  DESPITE THE CAUTIOUS TENOR OF THE LETTER AND ITS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR LABELING OF BIOTECH FOODS, POST REGARDS THIS </p><p>LETTER AS A SMALL STEP FORWARD IN OBTAINING THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR REJECTION OF </p><p>BIOTECH FOODS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  THE RESPONSE, COUCHED WITH CHARACTERISTIC VATICAN </p><p>CAUTION, CONVEYS THE HOLY SEE\'S APPRECIATION OF THE U.S. </p><p>ROLE IN OFFERING ASSISTANCE TO ALLEVIATE FURTHER HUNGER AND </p><p>STARVATION.  WHILE ASSERTING THAT THE HOLY SEE IS "NOT IN A </p><p>POSITION" TO EVALUATE WHETHER COUNTRIES SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT </p><p>USE SPECIFIC FOODS, IT OFFERS A NUMBER OF GENERALLY POSITIVE </p><p>"CONSIDERATIONS" LEADING TO THE VIEW THAT THERE IS NO REASON </p><p>FOR REJECTION OF BIOTECH FOODS, WHICH "SHOULD BE AVAILABLE </p><p>TO POPULATIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES."  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  04909  01 OF 02  081513Z </p><p>THE HOLY SEE INSISTED THAT THE USE OF BIOTECH FOODS SHOULD </p><p>BE ACCOMPANIED BY A "RIGOROUS AND PROPORTIONED CAUTION" AND </p><p>SHOULD BE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED FOR THE PUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  THE 1998 STUDY OF THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY FOR LIFE TO </p><p>WHICH TAURAN REFERS PROVIDED A GENERALLY POSITIVE ASSESSMENT </p><p>OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF BIOTECH FOODS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT </p><p>CONCEDED THAT BIOTECHNOLOGY WAS "WITHOUT DOUBT A FORMIDABLE </p><p>TOOL FOR PRODUCING MORE AND BETTER FOOD."  BUT IT ALSO SAID </p><p>THAT THE TECHNOLOGY "MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A RESPECT FOR </p><p>THE ENVIRONMENT," AND, "DEVELOPED COUNTRIES MUST FIND WAYS </p><p>TO SHARE BIOTECHNOLOGICAL CAPACITY WITH DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES."  THE REPORT CONCLUDES WITH NORMAN BORLAUG\'S </p><p>FAMOUS QUIP: "WE CAN\'T TURN BACK THE HANDS OF TIME AND ONLY </p><p>USE TECHNOLOGIES APPROPRIATE FOR A MUCH LESS POPULATED </p><p>WORLD."  WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE ACADEMY TO MOVE </p><p>THEIR ASSESSMENT BEYOND THIS STUDY BY DEVELOPING </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPOSE ITS STAFF AND MANAGEMENT TO VISITING </p><p>BIOTECH SCIENTISTS AND BIO-ETHICISTS.  WE WILL WORK WITH ITS </p><p>SISTER ACADEMY - THE PONTIFICAL ACADEMY OF THE SCIENCES - TO </p><p>SUPPORT A PROPOSED "STUDY WEEK" ON BIOTECHNOLOGY BY </p><p>COORDINATING THE PARTICIPATION OF RESPECTED US SCIENTISTS. </p><p> </p><p> 4. (U) IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PUSH TO HAVE THE HOLY SEE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THE STRONG MORAL ARGUMENT THAT U.S. FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE IS SAFE AND SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO HUNGRY </p><p>PEOPLE, THE AMBASSADOR TOOK ADVANTAGE OF AN OCTOBER 4 </p><p>CONFERENCE ON THE ETHICS OF GMO TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE </p><p>PHILIPPINES, ORGANIZED ON THE MARGINS OF THE CANONIZATION OF </p><p>JOSE MARIA ESCRIVA, FOUNDER OF THE OPUS DEI PRELATURE.  THE </p><p>AUDIENCE, CONSISTING OF PHILIPPINE BISHOPS AND SELECTED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  04909  01 OF 02  081513Z </p><p>BUSINESSMEN, WAS TREATED TO A GOOD PROGRAM OF EXPERTS IN </p><p>BIOETHICS AND BIOENGINEERING FROM VARIOUS PONTIFICAL </p><p>ACADEMIES IN SUPPORT OF GMO TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE </p><p>PHILIPPINES.  THE AUDIENCE WAS RECEPTIVE TO AMBASSADOR\'S </p><p>STRONG ARGUMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE MORALITY OF PROVIDING SAFE </p><p>U.S. FOOD ASSISTANCE TO THE HUNGRY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.  THE </p><p>ONLY SOUR NOTE WAS WHEN A VATICAN DESK OFFICER REPEATEDLY </p><p>INSISTED THAT THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>PONTIFICAL ACADEMIES WERE NOT THOSE OF THE VATICAN ITSELF </p><p>AND ASSERTED (FALSELY - SEE BELOW) THAT THE VATICAN HAS NO </p><p>POSITION ON BIOTECH FOODS.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRESENTATION, </p><p>A GROUP OF PHILIPPINE BISHOPS TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THEY FULLY </p><p>SUPPORTED HIS ARGUMENTS, AND BELIEVED THE PHILIPPINES SHOULD </p><p>MOVE AHEAD MORE AGGRESSIVELY TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE BIOTECH </p><p>FOODS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>TEXT OF TAURAN\'S LETTER </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ6103 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  04909  02 OF 02  081513Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  USNW-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  ITCE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    ED-01    EXME-00 </p><p>      E-00     FAAE-00  FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    FRB-00   HHS-01 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  NSF-01   OES-01   OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /015W </p><p>                  ------------------F38DD7  081513Z /38 </p><p>O 081436Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY MANILA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LILONGWE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUANDA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 004909 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT.
