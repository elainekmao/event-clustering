<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000779 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D, INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS(FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (FOR LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY:  International "Safety Net" for Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>Peace Talks </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The fate of the peace talks, together with </p><p>international efforts to coax the LTTE back to the </p><p>negotiating table, dominated the week\'s press.  English and </p><p>vernacular headlines chronicled a string of international </p><p>visitors who made their way to the Wanni to encourage the </p><p>LTTE to return to talks.  Predictably, government-owned </p><p>newspapers carried stronger, more positive headlines </p><p>regarding the "safety net" of international involvement in </p><p>the negotiations, while opposition and independent dailies </p><p>focused more on one implication of a continued LTTE absence </p><p>from the peace talks:  loss of donor money.  Frequent </p><p>editorials in the English opposition newspaper focused on </p><p>international involvement as" surreptitious attempts . to </p><p>compromise the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri </p><p>Lanka to keep the peace process on the track," although one </p><p>government-owned paper weighed in on this theme as well. </p><p>Early editorial comment in independent Tamil papers was </p><p>concerned with the continuation of the peace talks, but </p><p>later editorials became more outcome-oriented.  Considering </p><p>Assistant Secretary Rocca\'s impending visit, media coverage </p><p>of international involvement in the peace process will </p><p>likely continue over the weekend and into next week.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Headlines. </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  Throughout the week, all major newspapers chronicled </p><p>the activities of international visitors involved in re- </p><p>starting the peace talks.  The independent Tamil weekly, </p><p>VIRAKESARI, ran a representative headline (5/04): </p><p>"Important meetings this week in Vanni regarding the Tiger </p><p>stand in peace talks -- Bala, leaders of LTTE, diplomats </p><p>will take part."  The DAILY MIRROR (independent English </p><p>daily) continued on 5/5 with "Norway, Japan to try to </p><p>restart peace bid."  And two days later an independent </p><p>Sinhala daily, LAKBIMA, headlined "`Safety net of the </p><p>International Community supports us strongly\' - says PM in </p><p>the parliament." </p><p> </p><p>3. Predictably, government-owned newspapers carried </p><p>stronger, more positive headlines regarding international </p><p>involvement.  On 5/4 the SUNDAY OBSERVER (government-owned </p><p>English weekender) headlined "Peace activities shift to </p><p>Colombo & Vanni," and the Tamil weekly, THINAKARAN </p><p>VAARAMANJARI, also government owned, reported "U.S. </p><p>government interested in removing obstacles in peace </p><p>process."  On 5/5 the government-owned Sinhala daily, </p><p>DINAMINA, led with "Akashi, Helgerson, Solheim and Westborg </p><p>here:  Christina Rocca will arrive on 12th, Balasingham </p><p>came yesterday:  a series of vital talks this week between </p><p>GSL and LTTE."  And the DAILY NEWS (government-owned </p><p>English daily) wrote "Continuation of peace process -- </p><p>diplomatic moves gather momentum" (on 5/6) and "Global </p><p>Community will ensure resumption of peace process - PM" (on </p><p>5/7). </p><p> </p><p>4. Opposition and independent papers focused on the </p><p>implications of a continued LTTE absence from the peace </p><p>talks.  Under "UK to close doors for Bala if LTTE does not </p><p>attend peace talks," the independent Sinhala LANKADEEPA </p><p>SUNDAY wrote (on 5/4):  "Diplomatic sources say that Anton </p><p>Balasingham would be allowed to remain in the UK, which has </p><p>also listed LTTE as a terrorist organization, only if the </p><p>LTTE decides to attend the peace talks."  Concerned with </p><p>donor money, the opposition Sinhala daily, DIVAINA, </p><p>headlined:  "`Tokyo aid Conference vital for LTTE as well </p><p>for GSL - Yasushi Akashi."  And DIVAINA\'s English-medium </p><p>sister, the ISLAND, continued the theme on 5/8 with "Global </p><p>community will not pump funds if LTTE skips Tokyo confab - </p><p>Solheim." </p><p> </p><p>5. Late in the week, newspapers began to focus on the </p><p>results of international pressure to re-start the peace </p><p>talks.  The independent Tamil daily, VIRAKESARI, headlined: </p><p>"\'Talks only after the government implements the decisions </p><p>taken at talks\' - Prabhakaran informs Japanese Special </p><p>Envoy Akashi."  "Norway delegates speak plain words to </p><p>LTTE" said the government-owned Sinhala daily, DINAMINA. </p><p>And on 5/8 the independent Tamil daily, THINAKKURAL, wrote </p><p>"\'It is the duty of the International Community to get us a </p><p>proper reply from the government\' - Prabhakaran tells </p><p>Akashi at Kilinochchi," and "President unhappy that the </p><p>international community did not assure the continuation of </p><p>the talks without interruption." </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Editorials. </p><p>----- </p><p>6. Several editorials complained international involvement </p><p>was a threat to Sri Lanka\'s sovereignty. </p><p>- Under "Don\'t barter sovereign rights," the ISLAND </p><p>(opposition English daily) argued:  "a few select ministers </p><p>and top government officials along with representatives of </p><p>foreign nations . cannot barter away the sovereign rights </p><p>of the people of this country."  Excerpts: </p><p>"Right now Norway\'s Deputy Foreign Minister Vidar Helgesen </p><p>and Special envoy of the Japanese government, Yasushi </p><p>Akashi are in the Wanni attempting to negotiate on an issue </p><p>which is essentially an internal affair of Sri Lanka over </p><p>which the country is rapidly losing control. </p><p>"We have over the years, by permitting and inviting foreign </p><p>powers to come into the issue of quelling a terrorist </p><p>uprising internationalized the issue to an extent that the </p><p>sovereignty of this nation is being threatened by those </p><p>whom we have invited as\' facilitators\' and `peace keepers\'. </p><p>".Issues involving the sovereignty of the Sri Lankan nation </p><p>are for the Sri Lankan State to decide and are no concern </p><p>of foreigners. The president may keep mum and the prime </p><p>minister may acquiesce but such rights of the nation cannot </p><p>be surrendered in such a manner. </p><p>"All those involved in these so called peace negotiations </p><p>should realize that a few select ministers and top </p><p>government officials along with representatives of foreign </p><p>nations-- irrespective of their power-cannot barter away </p><p>the sovereign rights of the people of this country." </p><p>- Under the headline, "Meeting the Challenges of </p><p>Peacemaking," government-owned English DAILY NEWS, said </p><p>that, despite international assistance, "the Lankan parties </p><p>cannot shun the basic parameters of finding a solution." </p><p>Excerpts: </p><p>"True, we are receiving the constructive and amiable </p><p>assistance of foreign parties such as the Norwegian, </p><p>Japanese and US Governments and the majority of Lankans are </p><p>warmly appreciative of this help but the final peace could </p><p>be evolved by only the Lankan parties involved. </p><p>"It is the Lankans themselves who would be finally bearing </p><p>the burden of working out a power-sharing arrangement which </p><p>would be fair by all our communities. Our foreign friends </p><p>are only facilitators. This fact should be faced squarely </p><p>and remembered constantly. </p><p>"However, the Lankan parties cannot shun the basic </p><p>parameters of finding a solution: power-sharing within an </p><p>united Sri Lanka where every community could live in </p><p>dignity." </p><p>- Under "Wiles of Tiger allies" the ISLAND complained, "we </p><p>see surreptitious attempts being made to compromise </p><p>sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country to </p><p>keep the peace process on the track."  Excerpts: </p><p>"The Norway-led monitors seem to be never tired of working </p><p>overtime to sanitise LTTE terrorism. They are at present </p><p>labouring hard to elevate the so-called Sea Tigers to the </p><p>level of the Sri Lanka Navy under the pretext of preventing </p><p>clashes at sea. </p><p>"The peace process, we were told at the beginning was to </p><p>protect the country. But today we see surreptitious </p><p>attempts being made to compromise sovereignty and </p><p>territorial integrity of the country to keep the peace </p><p>process on the track." </p><p>"It is imperative that the President and the Prime Minister </p><p>put the country before the peace process. The best way they </p><p>can protect the national interest, which is under threat, </p><p>is to throw out the whole caboodle of terror-allies in </p><p>monitors\' garb." </p><p>And a third ISLAND editorial, "The choice:  Sovereignty of </p><p>the nation or the `Peace Process,\'" noted that </p><p>"Representatives of mighty nations" must be told to respect </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s integrity.  Excerpts: </p><p>"President Kumaratunga, the opposition and the people </p><p>cannot permit the government to cave into the demands of </p><p>the terrorists and endanger the lives of about 50,000 </p><p>soldiers in the north as well as the existence of the </p><p>security establishments. Yesterday, in parliament former </p><p>Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar made a scathing attack </p><p>on the government and pointed out in detail to the steady </p><p>erosion of the sovereignty of the country since the signing </p><p>of the Ceasefire Agreement. </p><p>"The point has now been reached for the government to </p><p>choose between safeguarding the sovereignty of the nation </p><p>and saving the `Peace Process\'. Prime Minister </p><p>Wickremasinghe, President Kumaratunga, the parliament and </p><p>the people have no choice because the \'peace Process\' is in </p><p>the interests of the nation and the nation cannot be </p><p>sacrificed for what ever cause. </p><p>"Representatives of mighty nations now pushing the </p><p>government on the HSZ must be firmly told that protection </p><p>of the sovereignty of the Sri Lankan nation supersedes all </p><p>other interests." </p><p>7. Editorial comment from Tamil newspapers was more </p><p>positive. </p><p> </p><p>- Under the headline  "Talks to resume talks," the </p><p>independent THINAKKURAL questioned "in what way are the </p><p>talks going to proceed?"  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"Even with Norway, Japan and some other members of the </p><p>international communities engaging in putting the talks on </p><p>track, they have failed to arrive at a firm decision. </p><p> </p><p>"At the moment the talks should be solely based on resuming </p><p>talks. If </p><p>Helgesen, Akashi, Bala, Professor Peiris, Milinda Moragoda </p><p>and others have to fly from country to country to get out </p><p>this situation, what and what will take place to bring </p><p>lasting peace." </p><p> </p><p>- Under the headline "Peace talks again," the independent </p><p>Tamil daily, VIRAKESARI, noted that international </p><p>shepherding of the peace process is a "good sign for the </p><p>resumption of talks."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"There were requests from all corners that the talks should </p><p>resume.  India, which abstained from taking part in any </p><p>talks, made a u-turn and said that the talks should resume </p><p>under any circumstance. Pressure built up not only from the </p><p>international community but also internally that the talks </p><p>should resume. </p><p> </p><p>"Soon talks will take place in Vanni with LTTE leader V. </p><p>Prabhakaran to clear the obstacles and resume peace talks. </p><p>LTTE theoretician Anton Balasingham, Norwegian Deputy </p><p>Foreign Minister Vidar Helgesen, Norwegian Special envoy </p><p>Eric Solheim, Former Norwegian Ambassador for Sri Lanka Jon </p><p>Westborg and Japanese Special envoy Ysushi Akashi will </p><p>participate in the discussions." </p><p> </p><p>"All these are good signs for the resumption of talks." </p><p> </p><p>- Finally, an editorial in the independent Tamil daily, </p><p>VIRAKESARI reminded the LTTE that it has "a duty to perform </p><p>in rebuilding North and East."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>"Liberation Tigers have its duty to perform in rebuilding </p><p>North and East.  Oslo Conference has given the Liberation </p><p>Tigers this responsibility and has expanded the role of the </p><p>international community. </p><p> </p><p>"Prime Minister had clarified that the international </p><p>community will support only if steps are taken to develop </p><p>not only North and East but the whole country." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
