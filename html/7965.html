The DART and WFP met with Coalition forces on 29 </p><p>April.  Coalition forces agreed to contact WFP </p><p>national staff and work with them to determine the </p><p>status of Ministry of Trade (MOT) buildings and </p><p>records, condition of silos, mills and warehouses, </p><p>water and electricity for these structures, IDPs, </p><p>and market prices for central and southern Iraq. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>LIST OF REQUESTS </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Further to reftel, the U.N. World Food Program </p><p>(WFP) Program Manager and DART met with Coalition </p><p>forces on April 29.  WFP laid out information </p><p>requirements integral to the revival of the public </p><p>distribution system (PDS) and requested that the </p><p>commander of the Coalition forces in each </p><p>governorate in central and southern Iraq (with the </p><p>exception of Basrah, An Nasiriyah, and Maysan where </p><p>WFP staff have already begun work) contact the WFP </p><p>national staff and collect the needed information. </p><p>WFP thus far has not been able to reach all its </p><p>national staff.  It is sending Thuraya phones to </p><p>different governorates so that communications with </p><p>national staff can improve.  WFP also asked </p><p>Coalition forces to relay to the Ministry of Trade </p><p>(MOT) staff that WFP is anxious to begin working </p><p>with them. </p><p> </p><p>3. WFP requested assistance in collecting answers to </p><p>the following questions: </p><p> </p><p>--  Does MOT staff have access to its offices? </p><p> </p><p>--  Does the Ration Center staff have access to its </p><p>offices?  (Note:  In Arabic, the registration center </p><p>is termed ration center.  It is the place where the </p><p>ration cards are issued and updated.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>--  What is the condition of the old records and </p><p>computer at each ration center? </p><p> </p><p>--  What is the condition of the silos, mills, and </p><p>warehouses?  WFP provided to Coalition forces a </p><p>checklist of items to review for each structure and </p><p>also asked that the Coalition focus on Baghdad, </p><p>Mosul, and Basrah, per ref tel.  The DART asked WFP </p><p>to prioritize the silos and mills in these three </p><p>cities as there are 39 in Baghdad, 16 in Mosul, and </p><p>9 in Basrah. </p><p> </p><p>--  What are the current stocks in the warehouses </p><p>and silos?  WFP recommended to Coalition forces that </p><p>it work with the MOT personnel in making this </p><p>determination. </p><p> </p><p>--  Does the warehouse have security, provided </p><p>either by the Coalition or by MOT security guards? </p><p> </p><p>--  Are there any MOT trucks in the warehouse? </p><p>(Note:  It has been discovered the MOT in Basrah </p><p>served as the central dispatch point for transport </p><p>for southern and central Iraq and operated a fleet </p><p>of 1,000 trucks.  MOT trucks were painted yellow. </p><p>WFP wants to determine how many of these trucks </p><p>still exist.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>--  Are there tanks of fuel stored in the warehouse? </p><p> </p><p>--  For how many weeks is the food in the household </p><p>expected to last? </p><p> </p><p>--  Are there any internally displaced persons </p><p>(IDPs)in the governorate?  Are they from within the </p><p>governorate or from another governorate?  What is </p><p>the reason for the movement?  Do they plan to return </p><p>home soon? </p><p> </p><p>--  According to hospital doctors, how many cases of </p><p>malnourishment exist in the hospital.  Are the rates </p><p>rising or falling? </p><p> </p><p>--  What is the status of the water and electricity? </p><p> </p><p>--  What are the market prices for the following </p><p>items:  rice, wheat flour, oil, sugar, meat, diesel </p><p>and cooking fuel? </p><p> </p><p>--  What is the exchange rate? </p><p> </p><p>4.  According to WFP, its national staff and the MOT </p><p>would handle questions regarding the food and flour </p><p>agents.  CARE also plans to assist with this, once </p><p>an agreement is reached between WFP and CARE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  DART learned from Coalition forces on 3 May that </p><p>guidance has been drafted to address these issues </p><p>and would be issued on 5 May.  Coalition forces are </p><p>forming U.N. "focus teams" in each governorate who </p><p>will work with WFP national staff to collect the </p><p>information as they have the institutional </p><p>knowledge. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
