HE WOULD NOT ESTIMATE HOW MANY BODIES HE </p><p>SAW.  THERE WERE MANY MORE BODIES, HE SAID, THAN COULD </p><p>HAVE POSSIBLY FIT INTO THE TRUCKS THERE.  A SERB VOICE </p><p>CALLED OUT AND TOLD THEM TO "CHOOSE A PLACE" TOGETHER IN A </p><p>LINE.  HE STOOD WITH THE OTHER FOUR MEN IN A LINE.  THEN A </p><p>VOICE ORDERED THEM TO FALL FORWARD.  AT THE SAME TIME, </p><p>N.A. FELT A SHARP PAIN IN HIS RIGHT ELBOW AND RIGHT SIDE. </p><p>HE FELL FORWARD IN EXTREME PAIN, AS HE THOUGHT HE WAS </p><p>DEAD.  A SERB CALLED OUT, "THIS IS ALLAH\'S STYLE OF WAR. </p><p>WE\'RE GOING TO EXCHANGE YOUR BODIES FOR THAT OF SILAJDIC." </p><p>HE LAY IN SEMI-CONSCIOUSNESS, HEARING PEOPLE SCREAMING </p><p>WITH PAIN.  THE SERBS CONTINUED TO SHOOT PEOPLE.  AS HE </p><p>LAY ALMOST DEAD, A STONE FROM THE GROUND RICOCHETED INTO </p><p>HIS LEFT FOOT.  HE HEARD A SERB ORDER AN OLD MAN TO SAY </p><p>ALLAH AL AKBAR, THEN SHOOT HIM WITH SEVERAL ROUNDS AS THE </p><p>OLD MAN SPOKE.  WHEN THE SHOOTING FINALLY STOPPED, A SERB </p><p>YELLED, "LOOK AT ALL THESE WELL-FATTED RABBITS.  IT\'S BEEN </p><p>A GOOD HUNT."  SOMEONE ORDERED THAT THE CORPSES BE CHECKED </p><p>TO SEE IF THEY WERE ALIVE.  ALTHOUGH SOLDIERS WALKED AMONG </p><p>THE GROUP, NO ONE TOUCHED N.A.

THE </p><p>MAN BIT THROUGH THE CORD TYING N.A.\'S HANDS, THEN N.A. </p><p>TRIED TO BITE THROUGH THE FOUR CORDS OF ROPE BINDING THE </p><p>OTHER.  AFTER HE HAD BROKEN TWO, THEY HEARD VEHICLES </p><p>COMING BACK.  THE OTHER MAN, O.H., ONLY SLIGHTLY GRAZED, </p><p>HELPED N.A., TO RUN TO THE WOOD.  THEY HID IN A SMALL </p><p>WOODED CREEK DOWNHILL FROM THE FIELD.  BOTH HEARD STRANGE, </p><p>THUD-LIKE NOISES AND SHOOTING, THOUGH MORE IRREGULAR THAN </p><p>PREVIOUSLY.  N.A.
