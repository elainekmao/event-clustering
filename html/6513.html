(SBU) In a meeting with Finance Minstate Dr. </p><p>Muhammad Khalfan bin Khirbash (the de facto Finance </p><p>Minister) on March 18, the Ambassador followed-up on </p><p>the issue of OPIC coverage for the UAE, first raised </p><p>by the UAEG last Fall in the context of the bilateral </p><p>Strategic Dialogue meetings in Washington.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that a number of U.S. companies have </p><p>expressed interest in seeing OPIC coverage extended to </p><p>the UAE.  Dr. Khirbash said the UAEG is still very </p><p>interested in securing OPIC coverage, particularly as </p><p>it might help attract additional U.S. foreign direct </p><p>investment (FDI). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Ambassador said the Labor Ministry\'s </p><p>recent drafting of a proposal to more formally </p><p>recognize workers rights (see reftels) is a positive </p><p>development.  Having these draft rules promulgated </p><p>might prove helpful in making the argument for a </p><p>return of OPIC coverage.  Dr. Khirbash agreed and said </p><p>he would contact the Labor Minister and push for rapid </p><p>approval of the proposed regulations. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Comment:  Having Dr. Khirbash weigh in may </p><p>help speed up the usually rather lengthy approval </p><p>process for regulations. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
