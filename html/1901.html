<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 PRETORIA 004997 </p><p> </p><p>C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y - PARA MARKINGS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/24/2011 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, SF </p><p>SUBJECT: NEXT STEPS IN THE "NEW AFRICAN INITIATIVE": THE </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN VIEW </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY ECONOMIC MINISTER/COUNSELOR ROBERT F. GODEC FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE AFRICAN UNION SUMMIT LAST JULY MERGED THE MAP AND </p><p>OMEGA DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES TO CREATE THE "NEW AFRICAN </p><p>INITIATIVE."  SAG DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS MAP/NAI </p><p>ISSUES COORDINATOR DAVID MALCOMSON BRIEFED EMBOFFS ON NEXT </p><p>STEPS IN THE EVOLUTION OF THIS PROCESS.  INITIALLY A 15 </p><p>NATION HEADS OF STATE GROUP WILL DEFINE THE TERMS OF </p><p>ADMISSION FOR OTHER COUNTRIES, REQUISITE CODES OF POLITICAL </p><p>AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR AND PRIORITY SECTORS AND PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CHOOSING THE 15 "FOUNDER" STATES WILL BE AN EARLY </p><p>DETERMINANT OF THE NASCENT INITIATIVE\'S INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CREDIBILITY.  THE NORTH AFRICAN GROUP WILL CHOOSE EITHER </p><p>TUNISIA OR LIBYA.  LIBYA\'S AU CLOUT IS CONSIDERABLE, BUT </p><p>MALCOMSON SAID "THE CHOICE MUST BE TUNISIA." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE "PRECONDITIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT" SECTION OF THE </p><p>"PROGRAMME OF ACTION," WHICH MALCOMSON SAID IS KEY TO THE </p><p>CREDIBILITY OF THE DOCUMENT, COMMITS THE LEADERSHIP TO </p><p>CONSIDER DETAILED AND COSTED MEASURES FOCUSED ON SUCH KEY </p><p>AREAS AS CONFLICT PREVENTION AND RESOLUTION, PEACEMAKING AND </p><p>ARMS PROLIFERATION.  SIMILARLY, THE "ECONOMIC AND CORPORATE </p><p>GOVERNANCE INITIATIVE" REQUIRES PARTICIPATING STATES TO PUSH </p><p>FOR A SET OF TIMEBOUND AND SPECIFIC PROGRAMS ENHANCING THE </p><p>QUALITY OF ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. </p><p>MALCOMSON NOTED THAT CONSIDERATIONS OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY </p><p>WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO FRUSTRATE PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING </p><p>THESE GOALS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MEMBERS OF THE MAP/NAI STEERING COMMITTEE WILL TRAVEL TO </p><p>WASHINGTON, NEW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA IN COMING WEEKS TO </p><p>PROMOTE AND BUILD SUPPORT FOR THIS INITIATIVE.  A FINANCING </p><p>SUMMIT IS SLATED FOR JANUARY 2002, A DATE WHICH MAY BE PUSHED </p><p>BACK TO ALLOW THE MAP/NAI SECRETARIAT TO COMPLETE WORK ON </p><p>DEFINING GOVERNANCE PRACTICES AND NEEDS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>THE "NEW AFRICAN INITIATIVE" IS BORN </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE JULY AFRICAN UNION SUMMIT IN LUSAKA ADOPTED A "NEW </p><p>AFRICAN INITIATIVE" MERGING THE RIVAL MAP AND OMEGA </p><p>DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES.  SOUTH AFRICAN DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS COORDINATOR FOR MAP/NAI ISSUES DAVID MALCOMSON </p><p>BRIEFED ECONOFF FREUND AND POLOFF MCNAMARA AUGUST 22 ON NEXT </p><p>STEPS ON THIS CENTRAL LEGACY INITIATIVE OF THE MBEKI </p><p>PRESIDENCY.  IN THE NAI (WHICH SOUTH AFRICA HOPES TO RENAME </p><p>MAP, IF ONLY BECAUSE "NAI" IS AN AFRIKAANS OBSCENITY) AN </p><p>INITIAL 15 NATION HEADS OF STATE GROUP WILL DEFINE THE TERMS </p><p>OF TERMS OF ADMISSION OF OTHER AFRICAN STATES, THEIR CODE OF </p><p>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR AND THE PRIORITY SECTORS AND </p><p>PROJECTS FOR FUNDING FROM BOTH INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>SOURCES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) THE FIFTEEN ORIGINAL STATES WILL BE DRAWN THREE EACH </p><p>FROM THE FIVE AFRICAN SUB-REGIONS, AND WILL INCLUDE THE </p><p>ORIGINAL MAP/OMEGA DRAFTERS SOUTH AFRICA, NIGERIA, ALGERIA, </p><p>SENEGAL, AND EGYPT. SADC HAS ALREADY AGREED THAT THE OTHER </p><p>TWO SOUTHERN AFRICAN STATES WILL BE MOZAMBIQUE AND BOTSWANA. </p><p>THE OTHER REGIONS WILL PROBABLY SELECT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>THROUGH CONSULTATIONS IN ADDIS ABABA, MALCOMSON EXPLAINED. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) A KEY EARLY TEST FOR THE PROCESS WILL BE NORTH AFRICA\'S </p><p>CHOICE.  WITH EGYPT AND ALGERIA ALREADY IN, AND MOROCCO NOT </p><p>AN AU MEMBER, THE CHOICE COMES DOWN TO TUNISIA AND LIBYA. </p><p>"THE CHOICE MUST BE TUNISIA", MALCOMSON CONFIDED </p><p>CONFIDENTIALLY.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT LIBYA HAS CONSIDERABLE </p><p>CLOUT WITHIN THE AU, (AND IS GENERALLY CREDITED WITH </p><p>TRANSFORMING THE OAU INTO THE AU), BUT LIBYAN MEMBERSHIP </p><p>WOULD SEVERELY DAMAGE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE NASCENT </p><p>INITIATIVE, MALCOMSON BELIEVED. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>PEACE AND GOVERNANCE ARE KEY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) MALCOMSON UNDERLINED THE SOUTH AFRICAN VIEW THAT THE </p><p>"PRECONDITIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT" SECTION OF THE MAP "PROGRAMME </p><p>OF ACTION" WAS KEY TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT. </p><p>(FULL TEXT AT WWW.MAPSTRATEGY.COM OR WWW.DFA.GOV.ZA)  IN </p><p>SPITE OF OPPOSITION BY SOME AFRICAN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING </p><p>SENEGAL\'S WADE, THE SAG INSISTED ON LANGUAGE MEMORIALIZING </p><p>THE "PEACE, SECURITY AND POLITICAL GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES" </p><p>AND THE "ECONOMIC AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INITIATIVE."  THE </p><p>FIRST COMMITS THE AFRICAN INITIATIVE LEADERSHIP TO CONSIDER, </p><p>WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF ITS ESTABLISHMENT, DETAILED AND COSTED </p><p>MEASURES IN EACH OF FOUR KEY AREAS: </p><p> </p><p>A)    PREVENTION, MANAGEMENT AND RESOLUTION OF CONFLICT; </p><p> </p><p>B)    PEACEMAKING, PEACEKEEPING AND PEACE ENFORCEMENT; </p><p> </p><p>C)    POST-CONFLICT RECONCILIATION, REHABILITATION AND </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION; AND </p><p> </p><p>D)    COMBATING THE ILLICIT PROLIFERATION OF SMALL ARMS, </p><p>LIGHT WEAPONS AND LANDMINES. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE MAP DOCUMENT SPECIFIES THAT THIS EXERCISE WILL </p><p>INCLUDE THE ACTIONS REQUIRED OF PARTNERS AND THE NATURE AND </p><p>SOURCES OF FINANCING FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES. </p><p> </p><p>10.(C) SIMILARLY, THE "ECONOMIC AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE </p><p>INITIATIVE" CALLS UPON THE AFRICAN INITIATIVE LEADERSHIP TO </p><p>"PROMOTE THROUGHOUT THE PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES A SET OF </p><p>CONCRETE AND TIMEBOUND PROGRAMMES AIMED AT ENHANCING THE </p><p>QUALITY OF ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AS WELL </p><p>AS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE."  BY WAY OF IMPLEMENTATION, A TASK </p><p>TEAM FROM MINISTRIES OF FINANCE AND CENTRAL BANKS "WILL BE </p><p>COMMISSIONED TO REVIEW ECONOMIC AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE </p><p>PRACTICES IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, AND MAKE </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS ON APPROPRIATE STANDARDS AND CODES OF GOOD </p><p>PRACTICE FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE HEADS OF STATE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE WITHIN SIX MONTHS." </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) MALCOMSON NOTED THAT THESE COMMITMENTS PLACE SECURELY </p><p>UPON AFRICAN COUNTRIES THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ESTABLISHING </p><p>AND PRESERVING AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO DEVELOPMENT. </p><p>POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN PARTICIPATING </p><p>COUNTRIES WILL BE SUBJECT TO SCRUTINY BY OTHER MAP STATES AND </p><p>ALL WILL HAVE A JOINT RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP BRING </p><p>NONCONFORMING GOVERNMENTS INTO COMPLIANCE WITH MUTUALLY </p><p>AGREED MINIMUM STANDARDS AND CODES OF GOOD PRACTICE. </p><p>MALCOMSON EMPHASIZED THAT, UNLIKE IN THE PAST, CONSIDERATIONS </p><p>OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO FRUSTRATE THE </p><p>PROCESS.  THERE WILL BE STRONG PRESSURE TO CONFORM TO AGREED </p><p>UPON STANDARDS AND THE AFRICAN INITIATIVE LEADERSHIP WILL NOT </p><p>HESITATE TO ENGAGE MEMBER STATES IN WAYS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN </p><p>CONSIDERED TOO INTRUSIVE IN THE PAST. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WILL WORK THROUGH A "YELLOW </p><p>CARD/RED CARD" MECHANISM DRAWN FROM THE WORLD OF SOCCER. THIS </p><p>MECHANISM WAS FIRST ADOPTED BY THE OAU IN 1999, AT SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA\'S URGING, WITH REGARDS TO NON-CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT.  A NON-CONFORMING COUNTRY IS FIRST WARNED </p><p>(YELLOW CARD) AND GIVEN ONE YEAR TO RECTIFY ITS BEHAVIOR. </p><p>FAILING THAT, IT IS TEMPORARILY EXPELLED FROM THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION (RED CARD). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION AND SECTORAL PRIORITIES </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) MALCOMSON RECALLED THAT DURING THE G8 MEETING IN GENOA </p><p>THE FOLLOWING SECTORAL PRIORITIES HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED: </p><p> </p><p>A)    INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT); </p><p>B)    MARKET ACCESS; </p><p>C)    DEBT RELIEF; AND </p><p>D)    COMMUNICABLE DISEASES - (HIV/AIDS, MALARIA AND </p><p>TUBERCULOSIS). </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) IT IS NOT CLEAR NOW WHETHER INITIATIVE LEADERS WILL OPT </p><p>TO FOCUS ON THESE PRIORITIES ON A SPECIFIC PROJECT BASIS OR </p><p>TO APPROACH THEM IN TERMS OF A BROADER,  "MACRO" STRATEGY. </p><p>HE INDICATED THAT A DECISION ON THIS WOULD LIKELY EMERGE FROM </p><p>THE UPCOMING MEETING IN ADDIS ABABA SEPTEMBER 13- 14, 2001. </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT OF TASK TEAMS TO BEGIN SECTORAL NEEDS </p><p>ASSESSMENTS AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND CONTINENTAL LEVELS ARE </p><p>SLATED TO TAKE PLACE SIX MONTHS AFTER THE ADDIS ABABA </p><p>MEETING.  HE ALSO SAID THAT SPECIAL TASK TEAMS TO FOCUS ON </p><p>THE HIGH PRIORITY PROGRAMS (INFECTIOUS DISEASES, </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE AND ICT) WOULD BEGIN WORK AFTER THE UN GENERAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY MEETING IN NEW YORK SEPTEMBER 20-24. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>MAP GOES TO WASHINGTON (AND PHILLY AND NEW YORK) </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) MALCOMSON SAID "MEMBERS" OF THE MAP STEERING COMMITTEE </p><p>WILL TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON FOLLOWING THE ADDIS ABABA MEETINGS </p><p>TO MEET WITH THE IMF, WORLD BANK, AND "STATE DEPARTMENT </p><p>OFFICIALS" (NFI) FROM SEPTEMBER 16 -18.  ON SEPTEMBER 19 THE </p><p>PRESIDENTS OF NIGERIA, ALGERIA AND SOUTH AFRICA WILL </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN A MEETING OF THE CORPORATE COUNCIL FOR AFRICA </p><p>IN PHILADELPHIA, POSSIBLY JOINED BY PRESIDENT WADE OF </p><p>SENEGAL.   THE TRAVELLING ROAD SHOW WOULD THEN MOVE ON TO NEW </p><p>YORK SEPTEMBER 20 -24 TO PRESENT ITS WORK ON THE MARGINS OF </p><p>EITHER THE UNGA OR THE UN CHILDREN\'S SUMMIT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>DONORS ON THE LINE IN EARLY 2002 </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) THE SHOW AND TELL EXERCISE WOULD CULMINATE IN A PLANNED </p><p>FINANCING SUMMIT OF WORLD LEADERS IN SENEGAL EARLY IN 2002. </p><p>THIS SUMMIT WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR NOVEMBER 2001, WHICH </p><p>WOULD HAVE CONFLICTED WITH SENEGALESE ELECTIONS, MALCOMSON </p><p>EXPLAINED.  A NEW TENTATIVE DATE OF JANUARY 2002 WAS SET. </p><p>POLOFF NOTED THAT THE MAP SECRETARIAT\'S OWN WORK ON DEFINING </p><p>GOVERNANCE PRACTICES AND NEEDS WAS NOT SCHEDULED TO CONCLUDE </p><p>UNTIL MARCH, SO A JANUARY SUMMIT TO APPEAL TO WORLD LEADERS </p><p>FOR FINANCING SOUNDED PREMATURE.  MALCOMSON TOOK THE POINT </p><p>AND SAID HE WOULD RAISE IT WITH MAP SECRETARIAT HEAD (AND </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ECONOMIC ADVISER) WISEMAN NKUHLU TO SEE IF THE </p><p>SUMMIT COULD BE PUSHED BACK. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) THE SAG IS WELL AWARE THAT MAP/NAI WILL FACE AN EARLY </p><p>AND CRITICAL TEST IN CHOOSING THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE 15 NATION </p><p>HEADS OF STATE GROUP.  MALCOMSON WAS QUITE BLUNT IN TELLING </p><p>US THAT THE CHOICE MUST BE TUNISIA, NOT LIBYA.  OTHERWISE THE </p><p>INITIATIVE\'S CREDIBILITY (AND PRESIDENT MBEKI\'S PRESTIGE) </p><p>COULD SUFFER A BLOW.  SOUTH AFRICA DOES NOT WANT MAP/NAI TO </p><p>END UP ON THE PILE OF FAILED AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES </p><p>AND WE EXPECT THAT THEY WILL DO ALL THEY CAN TO ENSURE THAT </p><p>LIBYA DOES NOT MAKE IT INTO THE INNER CIRCLE.  THE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICANS ALSO HOPE THAT THE USG WILL NAME A MAP/NAI </p><p>COORDINATOR BEFORE THE MAP STEERING COMMITTEE TRAVELS TO </p><p>WASHINGTON IN MID-SEPTEMBER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BLANEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
