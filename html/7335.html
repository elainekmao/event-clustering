<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000713 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>IRAQ PD FOR SMITH, PINESS AND ROOKARD </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: IZ, PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR IN IRAQ; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "What next for 26 million Iraqis </p><p>      after Saddam?" the independent daily "The Daily News" </p><p>      dedicated its April 10 editorial to the need for the </p><p>      UN to be engaged in the reconstruction of Iraq. </p><p>      Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "The United Nations is justified to be concerned </p><p>      at the future of the 26 million people of Iraq after </p><p>      the United States-British forces have routed Saddam </p><p>      Hussein and set up a `colonial\' administration.  The </p><p>      coalition seems undecided as to the role of the U.N. </p><p>      after the Iraqi dictatorship has finally been sent </p><p>      packing.  It is vital for the future of the U.N. for </p><p>      it to be given a role in the Iraq to be rebuilt after </p><p>      the war. . .  The world needs to restore its faith in </p><p>      the U.N., whose efficacy as the final arbiter of peace </p><p>      in the world has been sorely challenged by the U.S.-UK </p><p>      adventure in Iraq. . .  The morality of the military </p><p>      action against Saddam Hussein will be debated for a </p><p>      long time to come, along with the new doctrine of the </p><p>      U. S. Government of `regime change. . .\'   What does </p><p>      the future hold for what have been called `rogue </p><p>      regimes\' which ignore everything that can conceivably </p><p>      be seen as allowing for the freedom to the people to </p><p>      exercise their inalienable rights as citizens?  There </p><p>      are governments today, members of the U.N., who can be </p><p>      slotted into this category.  The U.N. itself has no </p><p>      power to act against them, unless there is consensus </p><p>      for such action among the five permanent members of </p><p>      the Security Council.  If there is no consensus, what </p><p>      happened to Saddam Hussein becomes an option, a </p><p>      dangerous option, but an option nevertheless." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
