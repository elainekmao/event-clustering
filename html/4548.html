<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008730 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA CROCKER, NEA/NGA AND EUR/SE; </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; </p><p>DAMASCUS FOR WALKER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTHERN IRAQ: TURKMEN FRONT AGREES TO ATTEND </p><p>OPPOSITION CONFERENCE, WANTS PRO-KDP TURKMEN COUNTED </p><p>AGAINST SOMEONE ELSE\'S NUMBERS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 8142 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 7993 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 7775 </p><p>     D. ANKARA 7550 </p><p>     E. ANKARA 7509 </p><p>     F. ANKARA 7148 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Pol-Mil Counselor Stuart Brown.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Operation Northern Watch POLAD met with Iraqi Turkmen </p><p>Front (ITF) Ankara rep and Executive Committee member Dr. </p><p>Mustafa Ziya November 29.  Ziya shared the text (see para 3) </p><p>of the opposition conference steering committee\'s response to </p><p>the ITF\'s complaint letter of November 5 (ref B).  ziya noted </p><p>that the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Supreme </p><p>Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) continued to </p><p>oppose granting ITF requests.  He said that the ITF had </p><p>agreed to participate in the London conference after ITF </p><p>Chairman Sanan Aga received a letter from four senior USG </p><p>official encouraging its participation.  Ziya added that the </p><p>ITF now had only one demand - that the pro-KDP Turkmen cited </p><p>ref A not be counted against the 6 percent of the seats </p><p>reserved for Turkmen (which, with the addition of the </p><p>independents, is now closer to 4 percent, he claimed).  "Let </p><p>them come as part of the KDP group, or as independents," he </p><p>said. Ziya hoped that, with USG help, this problem could be </p><p>solved.  We stressed that the ITF should not expect USG </p><p>intervention on this point.  Ziya then assured ONW POLAD that </p><p>ITF reps in London would continue to negotiate this with the </p><p>steering committee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ziya told us that the KDP and SCIRI had a "secret" </p><p>agreement to support each other\'s positions at the </p><p>conference, including on the KDP\'s draft constitution.  With </p><p>a total of 113 seats, Ziya said, the KDP and SCIRI would </p><p>drive the outcome.  Ziya worried that if the KDP draft were </p><p>approved, the federal structure would separate 4 million </p><p>Sunnis from the south/center of Iraq, leaving the </p><p>southern/central federal unit with 80 percent Shi\'a.  Ziya </p><p>also promised us an advanced copy of the ITF\'s presentation </p><p>for the conference, which he expected would win approval from </p><p>90 percent of the delegates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Text of Steering Committee Reply to ITF (As translated </p><p>by the ITF) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Preparation of the Iraqi Opposition Congress, London, 20/11/02 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ITF Responsibilities </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We received your letter on the Opposition Congress and we </p><p>analyzed your requests in detail during our meetings in a </p><p>positive manner.  Please find below our suggestions on your </p><p>requests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. All documents, statements and participation of branches, </p><p>emerging after the opposition congress will be considered </p><p>seriously by the preparation committee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Concerning your request on participating the preparation </p><p>activities; As you also know, the six person\'s group decided </p><p>on the August Washington meeting, not to enlarge the </p><p>preparation committee beyond their group and also to finance </p><p>the congress all by their own.  The commission is a technical </p><p>committee whose activities will have an end immediately with </p><p>the start of the congress.  The participation of any group </p><p>might be considered as an example for the others and our </p><p>former experiences have proved that large preparation </p><p>activities, participated by 20 groups or more are mostly </p><p>resulted nor practical neither beneficial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The participation rates of the 1992 Salahadeen congress </p><p>have been taken essential to the participation of the </p><p>political, national and religious trends for the coming </p><p>congress.  As there are no clear statistics about the </p><p>structure and population rates of the Iraqi community, the </p><p>determined participation rates might appear to be unfair. </p><p>All of us feel treated unjustly about this case.  It is hard </p><p>to change these rates at the moment since a change in favor </p><p>of one group will affect the others.  Actually the </p><p>participation rates will not affect the results of the </p><p>congress because the results will depend on political </p><p>conciliation, not on votes.  all documents will be presented </p><p>as drafts, open to discussion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. In order to ensure your participation to this congress </p><p>which is the hope of all Iraqi people, the commission </p><p>increased the number of the Turkmen delegation to 15 persons, </p><p>including 8 persons from the ITF.  This means a majority for </p><p>the Turkmen participation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We expect you positive contribution to this very important </p><p>congress which is expected forwardly by the Iraqi community </p><p>and also the whole district. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Preparation Committee </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
