WORLD FOOD </p><p>PROGRAM\'S SOON TO BE RELEASED NEW EMERGENCY OPERATION </p><p>FOR AFGHANISTAN </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ROME 00001 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY.  U.S. MISSION/ROME OFFICERS MET ON </p><p>THURSDAY, JANUARY 17 WITH THE U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM </p><p>(WFP) ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (AED) AND DIRECTOR </p><p>OF OPERATIONS, MOHAMED ZEJJARI TO EXPRESS U.S. CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT THE SOON TO BE RELEASED NEW EMERGENCY OPERATION </p><p>(EMOP) FOR AFGHANISTAN.  THE PRIMARY POINTS CENTERED </p><p>AROUND A LACK OF SUPPORTING DATA FOR THE PROPOSED </p><p>PROGRAMS AND THE NEED TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE </p><p>EFFECTS OF FOOD AID AND MAKE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS TO </p><p>WFP PROGRAMS.  WFP INCORPORATED THE SUGGESTED ADDITIONS </p><p>INTO THE EMOP WHICH IS TO BE RELEASED IN THE COMING </p><p>DAYS.  WFP REPORTED THAT U.S. REQUESTED SPOT-CHECKS TO </p><p>THE VAM FINDINGS ARE PLANNED FOR FEBRUARY.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  WFP PROVIDED THE U.S. MISSION/ROME AND </p><p>USAID/DCHA/FOOD FOR PEACE OFFICE (FFP) WITH AN ADVANCE </p><p>COPY OF WFP\'S NEW EMOP, WHICH BEGINS ON APRIL 2002 AND </p><p>ENDS DECEMBER 31, 2002.  THE VERSION PROVIDED WAS DATED </p><p>JANUARY 8.  AFTER READING THE DOCUMENT, THE U.S. </p><p>MISSION/ROME AND USAID/FFP HAD SOME CONCERNS.  ON </p><p>THURSDAY, JANUARY 17, U.S. MISSION/ROME OFFICERS </p><p>LAVELLE AND DAVIS MET WITH WFP\'S ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE </p><p>DIRECTOR (AED) AND DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS, MOHAMED </p><p>ZEJJARI, AND WFP\'S CHIEF OF THE OFFICE OF HUMANITARIAN </p><p>AFFAIRS (OHA), FRANCESCO STRIPPOLI, TO REVIEW U.S. </p><p>CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>CONCERNS VOICED </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  SENIOR EMERGENCY COORDINATOR (SEC) DAVIS RELAYED </p><p>TWO PRIMARY CONCERNS AND LEFT BEHIND A MEMO THAT </p><p>OUTLINED MORE DETAILED COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT EMOP.  THE </p><p>PRIMARY POINTS WERE THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>A.  WFP PROPOSES A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS IN THE NEW EMOP. </p><p>SOME ARE REVIVED PROJECTS FROM PRE-SEPTEMBER 11; OTHERS </p><p>ARE A CONTINUATION OF CURRENT RELIEF ACTIVITIES; AND </p><p>SOME ARE COMPLETELY NEW.  THESE PROJECTS ARE OUTLINED, </p><p>HOWEVER, WITH LITTLE TO NO SUPPORTING DATA TO JUSTIFY </p><p>THE NEED.  STATEMENTS ARE MADE ABOUT HIGH MORTALITY </p><p>RATES, HIGH MALNUTRITION RATES, AND THE NEED FOR </p><p>CONTINUED FOOD AID, BUT NO ACTUAL DATA IS PROVIDED. </p><p>ONE WOULD SURMISE FROM READING THE DOCUMENT THAT ONLY </p><p>ANECDOTAL INFORMATION EXISTS. </p><p>THE VULNERABILITY AND ANALYSIS MAPPING (VAM) UNIT HAS </p><p>ACCUMULATED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DATA, AND EVEN </p><p>THOUGH SEVERAL MONTHS OLD, NONE OF THAT DATA IS </p><p>UTILIZED.  THE PROGRAMS MAY INDEED BE VERY MUCH NEEDED </p><p>IN AFGHANISTAN, BUT THEY SHOULD BE SUBSTANTIATED. </p><p> </p><p>B.  THERE IS NO MENTION AS TO HOW THE AFGHANISTAN FOOD </p><p>SECURITY UNIT (AFSU, FORMER VAM) FINDINGS WILL BE </p><p>FOLDED INTO THE PROGRAMMATIC ACTIVITIES OR HOW PROGRAMS </p><p>MAY BE ADJUSTED EACH MONTH ON THE BASIS OF THE AFSU\'S </p><p>FINDINGS.  AND NO MENTION IS MADE OF TRACKING THE </p><p>IMPACT OF FOOD AID ON THE MARKETS TO ENSURE THAT FOOD </p><p>AID IS NOT HAVING A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ZEJJARI TOLD THE OFFICERS THAT MANY OF OUR DETAILED </p><p>CONCERNS HAD ALSO BEEN SHARED BY HIM AND HE HAD TWICE </p><p>REQUESTED RE-WRITES TO THE EMOP SINCE THE JANUARY 8 </p><p>VERSION.  ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SHARE THE MOST-RECENT </p><p>VERSION WITH THE OFFICERS, HE DID READ PARTS THAT </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES HAD TAKEN PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ZEJJARI WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE NEED TO ADD </p><p>LANGUAGE TO THE EMOP ABOUT POINT B ABOVE, HOWEVER HE </p><p>ARGUED THAT PROVIDING ALL THE DATA (POINT A) TO JUSTIFY </p><p>WFP\'S PROGRAMS WOULD MAKE THE EMOP DOCUMENT TOO LONG. </p><p>THE SEC COUNTERED THAT THERE IS A HAPPY MEDIUM BETWEEN </p><p>NO DATA AND AN OVERWHELMING QUANTITY.  COPIES OF THE </p><p>MEMO WITH THE DETAILED POINTS WERE LEFT WITH HIM AND </p><p>STRIPPOLI AND HAVE BEEN SENT TO USAID/FFP AND </p><p>USAID/DART/ISLAMABAD. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>SPOT-CHECKING THE VAM RESULTS </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS RELAYED IN REF TEL, MISSION OFFICERS HAD </p><p>ENCOURAGED WFP TO CONDUCT "SPOT-CHECKS" OF THE VAM </p><p>RESULTS IN A FEW DISTRICTS OF AFGHANISTAN THAT ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY ACCESSIBLE.  IN THE MEETING, THEY ASKED ABOUT </p><p>THE PROGRESS OF THIS EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ZEJJARI STATED THE VAM UNIT HAD RECENTLY BEEN </p><p>EXPANDED BY THREE STAFF.  THE UNIT IS TAKING JANUARY TO </p><p>PREPARE AND DO RESEARCH, AND IN FEBRUARY THE FIELD WORK </p><p>WOULD BEGIN.  THE FIELD WORK IS TO INCLUDE THE </p><p>REQUESTED SPOT CHECKS.  USAID/DART CONTINUES TO FOLLOW </p><p>THIS ISSUE WITH WFP STAFF IN ISLAMABAD. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>PROGRESS MADE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  ON FRIDAY, JANUARY 18, U.S. MISSION OFFICERS TALKED </p><p>WITH ZEJJARI DURING THE LUNCH AT WFP WITH CONGRESSIONAL </p><p>DELEGATION KOLBE.  HE SHOWED THE SEC WHERE WFP ALREADY </p><p>HAD INCORPORATED THE PRIMARY CONCERNS INTO THE EMOP. </p><p>WFP IS HOPING TO RELEASE THE NEW EMOP CONCURRENTLY WITH </p><p>THE TOKYO PLEDGING CONFERENCE ON AFGHANISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.  HEILEMAN </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002ROME00303 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
