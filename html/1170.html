Driesser reviewed recent Dutch forays on </p><p>the Shiraz defendants, including Foreign Minister Van </p><p>Aartsen\'s contentious meeting with Iranian FM Kharazzi in </p><p>Tehran on May 29 (ref B).  The EU, Driesser noted, had </p><p>consistently called for a transparent process and for full </p><p>access to defense lawyers for the defendants and had stressed </p><p>to Tehran that death sentences would be totally unacceptable. </p><p> A Dutch Embassy rep was present in Shiraz for all of the </p><p>press conferences and would return for the next press </p><p>conference two days prior to the sentencing.  While Driesser </p><p>pointed out that the EU had not gone as far as demanding the </p><p>"release" of the defendants, he agreed that the EU\'s </p><p>conditions had not been met.  He concurred that the U.S., EU </p><p>and other interested parties should engage in immediate </p><p>consultations following the verdict to fashion a coordinated </p><p>response. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agriculture Minister to Visit </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) In other business, Driesser told A/Polcouns that the </p><p>announced visit of Dutch Agriculture Minister Brinkhorst - </p><p>held off in order to give Van Aartsen primacy of place - </p><p>would go forward as announced July 1-4.  The combined </p><p>government/business delegation will focus on promotion of </p><p>sales of technology for the dairy, poultry, floral and </p><p>fisheries industries, as well as other areas.  We understand </p><p>that Trade Minister Ybema is also  mulling over a separate </p><p>visit, though no date has been set. </p><p>SCHNEIDER </p><p></p></div>
