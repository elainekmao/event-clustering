<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 000309 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, YM, DOMESTIC POLITICS, DEMOCRATIC REFORM </p><p>SUBJECT: SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT SHEIKH AL AHMAR TALKS </p><p>DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT WITH AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  Within the scope of ongoing post meetings </p><p>with senior political figures in the run-up to the April </p><p>parliamentary elections, the Ambassador called on Speaker of </p><p>Parliament (and leader of the Islamist-oriented Islah Party) </p><p>Sheikh Abdullah Hussein al-Ahmar at his home on January 30. </p><p>In a brief, cordial and low-key meeting, conversation </p><p>centered around democratic development, the upcoming </p><p>elections and U.S. development assistance.  Although often </p><p>intensely anti-American in his public rhetoric, the Sheikh on </p><p>this occasion assiduously avoided contentious subjects such </p><p>as Iraq, the Palestinian issue, U.S.-Yemen counterterrorism </p><p>cooperation or the arrest of Islah party Shura Council member </p><p>al-Moayed in Germany.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Along with Ambassador Hull and Sheikh al-Ahmar, the </p><p>1/30 meeting included Hamid al-Ahmar (son of Sheikh Abdullah, </p><p>Member of Parliament and prominent businessman) and </p><p>Abduleqawe al-Qaisi, Director of the Office of the Speaker, </p><p>as well as DCM and Acting Pol/Econ Chief (notetaker). </p><p>Discussion took place entirely in Arabic. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>Democracy </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Sheikh al-Ahmar expressed concerns about the ROYG </p><p>and ruling General People\'s Congress (GPC) using the </p><p>advantages of incumbency, particularly the media, to </p><p>influence the outcome of the April elections and marginalize </p><p>the opposition.  He said the GPC planned to take "all" the </p><p>seats. and made a point of contrasting Western democracies </p><p>and their often close races with leaders in the Middle East </p><p>and their desire to get all the votes possible.  The sheikh </p><p>laughed and acknowledged reference to Saddam\'s 100 percent </p><p>victory as a typical example, but did not take this opening </p><p>for any further discussion of Iraq.  Al-Ahmar expressed </p><p>concern about possible violence in the April elections, and </p><p>the Ambassador agreed that all must be done to prevent it. </p><p>The Ambassador made a point about the importance of ensuring </p><p>enough women candidates in the election, and the Sheikh </p><p>agreed and said that women candidates are taking part. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Development </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The Sheikh was receptive and positive in response to </p><p>the Ambassador\'s briefing of USG development activities and </p><p>the return of USAID.  He noted that health and education </p><p>programs in deprived rural areas were especially important. </p><p>Al-Ahmar added that he believed military assistance was not </p><p>really important and that it should play a secondary role in </p><p>U.S. relations with Yemen and other countries in the region. </p><p>The Sheikh complained that none of the countries in the </p><p>region had external enemies to arm against, but still </p><p>emphasized military build-up rather than development simply </p><p>in order to repress their own people. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The Sheikh said that he and President Saleh would go </p><p>on the Hajj together. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Comment:  It is striking that Sheikh al-Ahmar </p><p>avoided even passing reference to any contentious issue in </p><p>this latest meeting with Ambassador Hull.  While he is </p><p>renowned for the venomous anti-U.S. quality of his public </p><p>remarks, he made no mention of Palestine, Iraq or the arrest </p><p>of Sheikh al-Moayed in Germany.  When hewing to the high </p><p>road, as on this occasion, al-Ahmar strikes a convincing pose </p><p>as an advocate of democracy and government accountability. </p><p>Unfortunately the high road is seldom his chosen route.  His </p><p>party\'s public announcement, several days after this meeting, </p><p>that Islah would field no female candidates and opposed the </p><p>inclusion of women candidates in the parliamentary elections </p><p>-- his contrary remarks to the Ambassador notwithstanding -- </p><p>was an all-too-typical example of his tendency to play to the </p><p>lowest, most exploitative common denominator of Islamic </p><p>rectitude in order to stir and sustain the fervor of his </p><p>constituents. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MISENHEIMER </p><p></p></div>
