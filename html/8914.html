(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) SUMMARY:  Conveying a message from President </p><p>Bush, U/S Bolton laid out USG concerns on the </p><p>nuclear weapons programs of both North Korea and </p><p>Iran in a June 18 meeting with MFA Minstate Hamdan </p><p>bin Zayid.  In the case of North Korea, U/S Bolton </p><p>asked for the UAE\'s support in denying hard </p><p>currency to the regime by helping us curtail DPRK </p><p>weapons sales which could fund their nuclear </p><p>program.  Hamdan expressed his deep appreciation </p><p>for U/S Bolton\'s visit, noting that the U.S. and </p><p>the UAE have a "special" relationship which has </p><p>been significantly strengthened in the post-9/11 </p><p>period.  Hamdan pledged the UAE\'s complete </p><p>cooperation in deterring the North Korean and </p><p>Iranian threats as these countries\' programs </p><p>endangered not only the Middle East region but the </p><p>world.  He cited UAE intelligence reports that the </p><p>Iranians have recently redoubled their efforts and </p><p>are "working more actively" on a nuclear program, </p><p>particularly following U.S. and European </p><p>expressions of concern.  The UAE had raised its </p><p>concerns about Iranian-Russian cooperation with the </p><p>GOR directly but did not buy Moscow\'s argument that </p><p>the Iranians are not pursuing this technology for </p><p>military purposes.   Hamdan also promised his </p><p>personal engagement in obtaining an early signing </p><p>of a bilateral ICC Article 98 agreement (see </p><p>septel). END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Under Secretary for Arms Control and </p><p>International Security Assistance John R. Bolton </p><p>met with UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs </p><p>Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan June 18 in Abu </p><p>Dhabi.  Bolton was joined by the Ambassador, </p><p>Special Assistant Mark Groombridge, Foreign Affairs </p><p>Officer Jodi Greene and Polchief (notetaker). </p><p>Hamdan was joined by office assistant Abdulrahman </p><p>Al-Romaithi and Presidential translator Zaki </p><p>Nusseibeh. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>U/S BOLTON ON NORTH KOREA:  TIME IS NOT ON OUR SIDE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) U/S Bolton began with North Korea, laying </p><p>out USG concerns about its dramatically increasing </p><p>nuclear weapons capability.  President Bush had </p><p>instructed the State Department to find a peaceful </p><p>solution to the crisis, using multilateral </p><p>conferences, the UNSC and North Korea\'s neighbors. </p><p>However, Bolton explained, diplomacy is a complex </p><p>process and "time is not on our side."  The </p><p>President has decided that we must examine other </p><p>"influences" in order to slow down the North Korean </p><p>program.  The USG\'s judgment is that the North is </p><p>supporting its hard currency earnings via sales of </p><p>WMD material and equipment, as well as drugs and </p><p>gambling enterprises.  U/S Bolton explained that </p><p>his unpublicized trip to the ME region, with stops </p><p>in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Kuwait, provided </p><p>an opportunity to discuss our concerns with friends </p><p>and to work together to cut off North Korea\'s </p><p>external earnings.  We wished to create a </p><p>"partnership" so that countries in the ME region </p><p>would look elsewhere than North Korea to fulfill </p><p>their legitimate weapons needs.  U/S Bolton made </p><p>clear that we were not attempting to revisit the </p><p>issue of past transactions and that we appreciated </p><p>the UAE\'s termination of their military cooperation </p><p>with the DPRK in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Bolton sought UAE engagement with Iran and </p><p>Libya where the U.S. does not have formal relations </p><p>and with Syria, with whom we do have diplomatic </p><p>ties, but where we have not been able to exercise </p><p>much influence.  The U/S offered to share </p><p>intelligence as part of our counter-terrorism </p><p>cooperation on transshipments, noting that the </p><p>North Koreans typically sell components via </p><p>clandestine means, including smuggling.  Bolton </p><p>briefed Hamdan on the President\'s Proliferation </p><p>Security Initiative, unveiled in Krakow in late </p><p>May, in which the U.S. seeks to use existing and </p><p>new authorities to go beyond traditional export </p><p>control mechanisms to interdict shipments of WMD on </p><p>sea, air and land.  The U.S. wants to make it </p><p>harder for the North Koreans and others to complete </p><p>these transactions by dramatically increasing the </p><p>costs of doing business. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>HAMDAN: NORTH KOREA AN EXAMPLE TO ROGUE ACTORS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Hamdan began by noting that the UAE does not </p><p>have a diplomatic relationship with North Korea and </p><p>is fully committed to cooperation with the U.S. </p><p>with regard to the nuclear threat.  Any weapons </p><p>proliferation in Asia poses a "direct threat to the </p><p>national security of the UAE," the MFA Minstate </p><p>continued.  In his view, how we deal with North </p><p>Korea will determine whether other rogue actors </p><p>will seek to develop dangerous weapons programs. </p><p>Noting U/S Bolton\'s earlier meeting with Dubai </p><p>Ports and Customs Authority Executive Director </p><p>Sultan bin Sulayem (septel), Hamdan asked if the </p><p>U.S. had particular concerns about Dubai as a </p><p>transshipment point.  He noted that the UAE federal </p><p>government would raise such issues with Dubai Crown </p><p>Prince Muhammad bin Rashid Al-Maktoum if necessary. </p><p>U/S Bolton believed that Dubai was "doing the right </p><p>thing" by seeking training for their customs </p><p>officials in order to alert them to possible WMD </p><p>shipments.  The U.S. looked forward to sharing more </p><p>information with Dubai, the U/S continued, </p><p>particularly as those who traffic in WMD are </p><p>getting increasingly sophisticated. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) Hamdan doubted whether the UAE alone could </p><p>exert much influence on the Libyans, Syrians and </p><p>Iranians, given their recalcitrant and secretive </p><p>nature.  He did not believe these governments would </p><p>be responsive to any approaches regarding their </p><p>dealings with North Korea.  Bolton suggested that </p><p>the UAE use its leadership in multilateral forums, </p><p>such as the OIC, GCC and Arab League to express </p><p>these concerns. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>IRAN:  MULTILATERAL EFFORTS KEY TO STOPPING PROGRAM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) U/S Bolton contrasted the close consultation </p><p>between the U.S., the UK and France on the threat </p><p>posed by Iran with that on Iraq.  Pointing to the </p><p>last G-8 statement, he noted there is some evidence </p><p>that the Europeans are equally concerned.  Bolton </p><p>explained the U.S. desire to keep Russia and France </p><p>"close to us" on Iran.  Tehran\'s story that it is </p><p>developing a civilian nuclear energy program is not </p><p>consistent with its behavior.  The U.S. believed </p><p>that if Iran continues at the present rate, it will </p><p>be able to produce nuclear weapons by the end of </p><p>the decade.  The U.S., he continued, has worked </p><p>hard with Russia to stop the supply of fuel to the </p><p>Bushehr facility.  We\'ve made some progress with </p><p>the GOR, but not with regard to the private Russian </p><p>scientists working with the Iranians.  Putin had </p><p>pledged to the President that the GOR would not </p><p>supply fuel to Bushehr until questions regarding </p><p>Iran\'s intentions are resolved. </p><p> </p><p>9. (S) U/S Bolton noted the "devastating" IAEA </p><p>report which was important as it represented an </p><p>international, not just a U.S., assessment and laid </p><p>out a range of unanswered questions that the </p><p>Iranians are refusing to answer, including why Iran </p><p>is developing a heavy-water production facility. </p><p>Bolton said the U.S. hoped the upcoming IAEA Board </p><p>of Governors\' meeting to be chaired by Kuwait will </p><p>reflect consensus and call on Iran to open up to </p><p>inspections.  It is the U.S. view that Iran will </p><p>not be able to answer the IAEA\'s questions which </p><p>may result in the U.S. referring the matter to the </p><p>UNSC in September.  Hamdan noted that he had </p><p>discussed the UAE\'s concerns with IAEA DG Al- </p><p>Baradei, urging a clear international message. </p><p>Bolton said he had encourged Al-Baradei to just </p><p>"report the facts and refrain from political spin," </p><p>can send the wrong message to Iran. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>UAE BELIEVES IRAN IS STEPPING UP NUCLEAR PROGRAM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>10. (S) Hamdan said the UAE was deeply concerned </p><p>about Iran\'s nuclear and ballistic missile </p><p>programs.  According to UAE intelligence, the </p><p>Iranians have recently redoubled their efforts and </p><p>are "working more actively" on a nuclear program, </p><p>particularly following U.S. and European </p><p>expressions of concern.  Hamdan pleaded "don\'t let </p><p>Iran have this capability as this will be a </p><p>disaster for the region."  The UAE welcomed broader </p><p>cooperation on Iran, particularly with the Russians </p><p>and Europeans, who in Hamdan\'s words "need to be </p><p>with us."  The UAE had raised its concerns about </p><p>Iranian-Russian cooperation with the GOR directly. </p><p>The UAE did not buy Moscow\'s argument that the </p><p>Iranians are not pursuing this technology for </p><p>military purposes.  Hamdan estimated there was "no </p><p>way for Russia to control the Iranians."  He noted </p><p>that the GCC Foreign Ministers\' meeting held </p><p>earlier in the week in Jeddah issued for the first </p><p>time a clear statement -- aimed directly at Iran -- </p><p>calling for a Gulf/Middle East region free of WMD. </p><p>The GCC was worried about the internal situation in </p><p>Iran; Saudi FM Saud Al-Faisal had shared his view </p><p>that Khatami and Rafsanjani, who usually differ </p><p>widely on issues, have come together and are now </p><p>singing the "same tune." </p><p> </p><p>11. (S) U/S Bolton said there was "no doubt" about </p><p>the Iranian/Russian linkage.  While it was clear </p><p>Putin doesn\'t want to see a nuclear-equipped Iran, </p><p>his desires don\'t seem to be penetrating down </p><p>through the GOR bureaucracy.  Bolton noted the </p><p>inherent conflict of interest in the Russian Atomic </p><p>Energy Agency which on the one hand fully </p><p>understands the Iranian threat but on the other </p><p>desires to sell reactors and fuel for profit.  As </p><p>for the North Koreans, who were subject to a </p><p>ballistic missile test moratorium, the U.S. </p><p>believes they have an agreement with Iran to share </p><p>data on Iran\'s ballistic missile tests.  Bolton </p><p>hoped that the GCC would convey its concerns to </p><p>Russia and the Europeans. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) This cable has been cleared by U/S Bolton. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
