O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, PGOV, EINV, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Fuel Crisis Intensifies </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Zimbabwe\'s fuel supply continues to </p><p>worsen.  Most motorists are grounded, importing their own </p><p>or buying it at exorbitant black market prices.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Even though the GOZ has increased the leaded </p><p>fuel price 6-fold since February, it is still unable to </p><p>pay a diminished subsidy of around 25 percent.  Official </p><p>fuel imports have dwindled to a trickle.  The Caltex </p><p>(ChevronTexaco) rep responsible for Harare told us he has </p><p>been receiving 20-25,000 liters/day, while one of his 20 </p><p>stations could easily sell 100,000 liters. Some </p><p>Zimbabweans now leave cars 2 weeks in fuel lines.  At the </p><p>same time, there is a burgeoning black market for fuel, </p><p>with prices presently around US$.85 and occasionally </p><p>reaching US$ 1.40 per liter - 3-to-5 times the official </p><p>price. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The Caltex rep claimed the GOZ\'s latest scheme - </p><p>still unannounced - will limit motorists to 30 liters per </p><p>"fill-up."  While this will not add to the country\'s fuel </p><p>supply, it will spread it more broadly.  It will also </p><p>make it possible for service stations that receive a </p><p>delivery of, say, 5,000 liters to count off the 167 cars </p><p>in line that will get their share, then inform the other </p><p>drivers that they are out-of-luck.  (Many Zimbabweans are </p><p>frustrated spending hours/days in fuel lines only to </p><p>watch the pump run dry just before their turn. </p><p>Occasionally, violence ensues.)  The 30-liter limit will </p><p>also prevent drivers from outfitting cars with ultra- </p><p>expanded tanks.  (The Caltex rep witnessed one small </p><p>truck with a 600-liter tank - quite an engineering feat!) </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) Flummoxed Zimbabweans don\'t seem to have a clue </p><p>why they are paying Z$ 1200-2000 for the same liter that </p><p>cost Z$ 74 as recently as November when Libya was giving </p><p>it away.  Locals who earn Z$150,000 (US$100)/month and </p><p>consider themselves solidly middle-class are just </p><p>beginning to realize they lack the wherewithal to own </p><p>cars, even use public transport in excess.  The speed of </p><p>their downward mobility is dizzying. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
