<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 000189 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, D, SA/INS, LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL; NSC </p><p>FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PTER, PINR, PARM, CE, IN, ECONOMICS, Elections, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: INDIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER ON SRI LANKA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR E. ASHLEY WILLS.  REASONS 1.5 B, D. </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  I met for one hour today (2/3) with Indian </p><p>High Commissioner Nirupam Sen concerning the current state of </p><p>peace talks in Sri Lanka.  To my surprise, we agreed </p><p>completely on our analysis of the situation (the trend is not </p><p>positive); on the reasons why (LTTE aggressiveness, </p><p>cohabitation tensions, the economy and Muslim agitation in </p><p>the east); and on the need for close Indo-US consultation and </p><p>cooperation re Sri Lanka.  And we came close to agreeing on </p><p>what should be done to improve matters.  We both think the </p><p>LTTE needs to be told that it must accept phased </p><p>demobilization of its military; in this regard, a crucial </p><p>first step would be acceptance by the Tigers of international </p><p>supervision of their long-range weapons on the Jaffna </p><p>Peninsula.  But whereas Sen believes the government should </p><p>abandon its economic liberalization in the short run, </p><p>focusing instead on poverty alleviation and populist measures </p><p>to curb the cost of living, I believe we should keep the </p><p>pressure on the GSL to push ahead with reform.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) I called on High Commissioner Sen at the Indian High </p><p>Commission.  I wanted to see how his and our assessments of </p><p>current conditions in Sri Lanka compare.  It turns out we </p><p>agree completely on our analysis.  Sri Lanka\'s attempt at </p><p>peace has gone surprisingly well to this point but the </p><p>sprint-like pace of progress will now slow to a mosey.  This </p><p>slowdown traces to four factors, any one of which by itself </p><p>could undo the progress made thusfar. </p><p> </p><p>The Tigers </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The biggest danger remains the Tigers.  While Sen and </p><p>I agree that the Tigers have given up their push for an </p><p>independent Eelam, a de jure state, they want it de facto. </p><p>This explains their aggressiveness in establishing courts, </p><p>police forces, "civilian" LTTE authority in Sri Lanka\'s east </p><p>and their unwillingness to consider disarming or demobilizing </p><p>until a final peace deal is signed.  Tiger aggressivness also </p><p>traces to their sensing weakness in the south; they trust PM </p><p>Wickremesinghe still but they worry that his government might </p><p>not last.  If he does fall, they want to get themselves into </p><p>the best position they can geopolitically in the northeast. </p><p>And if he doesn\'t fall and the peace talks proceed eventually </p><p>to a negotiated settlement, the Tigers hope they will be in a </p><p>strong enough position to insist upon the maximal devolution </p><p>of power to the northeastern entity they expect to dominate. </p><p>(Sen also agreed with our Embassy\'s "sloppy scenario", in </p><p>which a final peace deal ultimately subverts the Tigers but </p><p>he, like we, thinks there is much work to be done, and much </p><p>luck needed, to reach that happy moment.) </p><p> </p><p>Cohabitation </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Sen is convinced, and I now tend to agree, that the </p><p>President can be expected to do whatever she can to unseat </p><p>Ranil in the months ahead.  If that means doing a deal with </p><p>the extreme left JVP, so be it.  If it means staging </p><p>demonstrations over the rising cost of living or on </p><p>privatization, so be it.  She will only prorogue Parliament </p><p>and go for a general election when she is convinced she can </p><p>win, but in the meantime she can unsettle the south by any of </p><p>several covert means while professing publicly to be for </p><p>peace. </p><p> </p><p>The Economy </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Ranil has long acknowledged that the attempt at peace </p><p>must be accompanied by rapid economic growth.  And so far, it </p><p>has not happened.  There was growth in 2002, his first year </p><p>in power, but not enough to create a sense of well-being </p><p>country-wide.  The President, the JVP and others in the </p><p>opposition will seize on this issue to put the PM on the </p><p>defensive and divert his attention away from the peace talks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Muslims </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  Sen presented me with a chart indicating linkages </p><p>between Muslim groups, mainly in Sri Lanka\'s east, and </p><p>Pakistan\'s ISI.  This does not consitute proof, of course, </p><p>but we on our own have noted growing radicalism among Muslims </p><p>in the east.  This may well be partly because of money coming </p><p>in from Pakistan and elsewhere in west Asia, but I am </p><p>convinced an equally important factor is LTTE stupidity in </p><p>pushing its aggressive agenda in Muslim areas.  Meanwhile, </p><p>the elected leaders of Sri Lanka\'s Muslims have been too busy </p><p>vying for power to bother with genuine efforts to improve </p><p>conditions for their constituents, much less think </p><p>imaginatively about how Muslim interests could be protected </p><p>in a final peace deal. </p><p> </p><p>What Can Be Done to Improve the Odds </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Dispensing with any pretense at modesty, Sen and I </p><p>agreed that India and the US are the two countries that </p><p>matter most to the GSL and the LTTE.  So it is very important </p><p>that we consult and cooperate closely on Sri Lanka.  We both </p><p>thought the visit of Indian Foreign Secretary Sibal to </p><p>Washington this week could be a good occasion for the two </p><p>sides to dwell on Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  As for specific steps, we reckoned that a positive </p><p>move by the LTTE on its weapons could have a dramatically </p><p>positive impact on southern politics and cohabitation.  In </p><p>particular, Sen and I thought it high time for the Tigers to </p><p>acknowledge publicly that they must begin a phased </p><p>disarmament and demobilization of their military.  If they </p><p>are truly committed to a peaceful, negotiated outcome, then </p><p>this should not be too much to expect of them.  Full </p><p>disarmament and demobliziation can await a final deal, but </p><p>the iterative process should begin now.  In this regard, a </p><p>first step that would be much admired would be their </p><p>accepting international supervision, presumably through the </p><p>Scandinavian-staffed Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, of their </p><p>long-range weapons on the Jaffna Peninsula.  (I did not </p><p>mention to Sen the Deputy Secretary\'s scheduled speech on Sri </p><p>Lanka on February 14, but this might present a good </p><p>opportunity for the US to call for such a move by the LTTE.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) On cohabitation, we felt that both India and the US, </p><p>and every other interested external party, should continue to </p><p>use every meeting with both the President and the PM to </p><p>emphasize the importance of a southern consensus on peace. </p><p>The President, in particular, should have no doubts about how </p><p>her attempts at destabilizing Ranil would be viewed by Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s friends.  It probably won\'t deter her, we calculated, </p><p>but we should be clear with her anyway. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Where Sen and I disagreed concerned the economy.  He </p><p>understandably worries that continued free-market reforms, </p><p>which will lead to temporary unemployment and certain price </p><p>increases, will give the President, the extreme left JVP and </p><p>others in the opposition convenient pretexts for agitating </p><p>against Ranil\'s government.  This agitation could at least </p><p>distract the GSL from pursuing peace and at most precipitate </p><p>the government\'s fall, Sen fears.  So he believes the </p><p>government should abandon liberalization, "at least for three </p><p>to six months", and pursue poverty alleviation and populist </p><p>measures aimed at curbing the rise in the cost of living and </p><p>creating employment. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) I share his concern but not his remedy.  By septel, </p><p>we will be reporting a conversation I had with Minister </p><p>Milinda Moragoda this weekend in which he asks for our help </p><p>in improving the terms of the IMF\'s planned Poverty </p><p>Reduction/Growth Program for Sri Lanka.  While I think we </p><p>should urge the IMF to be generous in its PRG loan for Sri </p><p>Lanka, I believe we must continue to insist on reforms that </p><p>have the best chance of growing the country\'s economy.  Sen\'s </p><p>proposal is a quick, budget-busting fix; liberalization will </p><p>take longer but it is only through further opening of the Sri </p><p>Lankan economy that big amounts of foreign direct investment </p><p>can be attracted.  With the government\'s finances already </p><p>severely constrained, the only possible source of funds for </p><p>growth is FDI. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Sen is an old-school, Nehruvian Indian diplomat, a </p><p>Bengali leftist for whom anti-Americanism must be </p><p>instinctive.  But his country has changed and so too has his </p><p>own attitude.  We were so much in accord that it was a little </p><p>surreal. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) But it is in any case welcome that we and India </p><p>assess Sri Lanka the same.  In the weeks coming, I hope we </p><p>can come to terms with the GOI concerning how we can jointly </p><p>or, more likely, separately exert constructive influence on </p><p>the parties involved in the Sri Lankan peace attempt. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
