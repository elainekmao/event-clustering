<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001275 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S (KRAFT), AF/PD (COX AND ROBERTSON) </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: "STANDARD" EDITOR ARRESTED FOURTH TIME </p><p> </p><p>1.   On May 28 Bornwell Chakaodza, editor of the </p><p>    independent weekly "Standard" was arrested for the </p><p>    fourth time in less than two weeks.  As has become </p><p>    customary, Chakaodza was picked up by police at his </p><p>    office, taken to Harare Central police station, and </p><p>    charged with violating Section 80 1.b. of the Access </p><p>    to Information and Protection of Privacy Act" (AIPPA). </p><p>    That section of AIPPA deal with "abusing journalistic </p><p>    privileges" by "publishing falsehoods.  "Standard" </p><p>    entertainment editor Fungayi Kanyuchi was also </p><p>    arrested on May 28 on the same charges.  The May 28 </p><p>    arrest was Kanyuchi\'s third in 12 days.  Both </p><p>    journalists  were released after being charged and </p><p>    posting bail.  Neither was mistreated. </p><p> </p><p>2.   According to the paper\'s lawyer, the May 28 </p><p>    arrests were for a column Kanyuchi wrote about the </p><p>    jail conditions he experienced when he was arrested </p><p>    with Chakaodza on May 16. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Chakaodza\'s previous arrests were on May 16, 22 </p><p>    and 23.  The sustained harassment of Chakaodza and his </p><p>    staff continues to bleed the "Standard" of time and </p><p>    money for bail and lawyers, but has also become a </p><p>    perverse point of pride for the paper.  Chakaodza and </p><p>    his colleagues remain upbeat and determined to </p><p>    continue publishing stories they believe to be true </p><p>    and in the public interest. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
