REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) ACTION REQUEST - PLEASE SEE PARA 7. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) AFTER SEARCHING THE MDC HEADQUARTERS ON SEPTEMBER </p><p>14 (REFTEL), HEAVILY ARMED POLICE EXPANDED THEIR SEARCH </p><p>TO TWO OTHER MDC OFFICES, ALSO ON SEPTEMBER 14, </p><p>INCLUDING THE ONE CONTAINING THE OFFICE OF PARTY </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI.  MDC LAWYERS PREVENTED THE </p><p>POLICE FROM TAKING AWAY DOCUMENTS,  POINTING OUT THAT </p><p>THEIR SEARCH WARRANT ONLY PERMITTED A SEARCH FOR "ARMS OF </p><p>WAR." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO MDC ADVISOR CLIVE PUZEY, TWO SENIOR </p><p>MDC OFFICIALS -- GANDI MUDZINGWA, TSVANGIRAI\'S RIGHT-HAND </p><p>MAN AND NELSON CHAMISA, CHAIRMAN FOR YOUTH -- WERE </p><p>DETAINED AT HARARE\'S CENTRAL POLICE STATION FOR SIX HOURS </p><p>ON SEPTEMBER 14, BUT WERE RELEASED AT 10:00 P.M.  THEY </p><p>WERE NOT BEATEN OR MISTREATED, BUT WERE ASKED REPEATEDLY </p><p>TO IDENTIFY THE LOCATIONS OF MDC WEAPONS CACHES.  PUZEY </p><p>INSISTED THAT THE MDC HAS NO ARMS CACHES  -- IT HAD ONLY </p><p>A PISTOL FOR THE PROTECTION OF TSVANGIRAI, WHICH THE </p><p>POLICE CONFISCATED BEFORE THE JUNE ELECTIONS.  POLICE </p><p>ALSO SEARCHED THE HOME OF THE PARENTS OF AN MDC MEMBER OF </p><p>PARLIAMENT AND THE OFFICES OF THE ZIMBABWE FRANCHISE OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  05214  151110Z </p><p>ERICSSON\'S TELEPHONE COMPANY, WHOSE OWNERS ARE MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  ACCORDING TO AN MDC PRESS RELEASE, TWO OTHER </p><p>MDC EMPLOYEES WERE ALSO DETAINED AND RELEASED -- THE </p><p>CHIEF OF SECURITY AND A SECURITY OFFICER. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) LATE ON SEPTEMBER 14, THE HIGH COURT GRANTED AN </p><p>INJUNCTION STOPPING FURTHER POLICE ACTION.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>PUZEY, HOWEVER, THE POLICE, AGAIN HEAVILY ARMED, RETURNED </p><p>TO MDC HEADQUARTERS AT 7:00 A.M. ON SEPTEMBER 15 WITH A </p><p>NEW WARRANT.  THIS ONE APPARENTLY AUTHORIZES A SEARCH FOR </p><p>DOCUMENTS RELATING TO "WEAPONS OF WAR," AND, AS OF THE </p><p>WRITING OF THIS CABLE, POLICE ARE RIFLING THROUGH THE </p><p>MDC\'S FILES. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY BEING SUBJECTED TO </p><p>SERIOUS AND CRITICAL PUBLIC SCRUTINY AND APPEARS TO BE </p><p>INCREASINGLY FED UP WITH IT.   THE POLICE ACTIONS OF THE </p><p>LAST TWO DAYS, HOWEVER, ARE AN OUTRAGEOUS ATTEMPT TO </p><p>INTIMIDATE A LEGITIMATE, POPULAR OPPOSITION PARTY AND </p><p>HAVE DISTURBING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE POTENTIAL GROWTH OF </p><p>DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE HERE.  PUZEY SPECULATED THAT THE </p><p>RECENT EMBARRASSMENT OF ZANU-PF MP -- AND MINISTER OF </p><p>RURAL RESOURCES AND WATER DEVELOPMENT -- JOYCE MUJURU ON </p><p>THE PARLIAMENT FLOOR BY AN MDC MP COULD HAVE SPARKED THE </p><p>POLICE CRACKDOWN.  ACCORDING TO PUZEY, AN MDC MP PUBLICLY </p><p>TOOK MUJURU TO TASK FOR FAILING TO RESPOND TO HER </p><p>CONSTITUENTS\' LONGSTANDING REQUEST FOR THE BUILDING OF A </p><p>BRIDGE.  MUJURU\'S HUSBAND, "REX" MUJURU, IS A RETIRED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  05214  151110Z </p><p>GENERAL WHO STILL RETAINS A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE WITH </p><p>SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUGABE, </p><p>AND COULD HAVE PRESSED FOR THE POLICE ACTION AS </p><p>RETRIBUTION. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD HAS REQUESTED A MEETING WITH </p><p>HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER JOHN NKOMO, WHOSE MINISTRY OVERSEES </p><p>THE POLICE.  THE AMBASSADOR IS ASKING LIKE-MINDED </p><p>AMBASSADORS TO JOIN HIM IN THIS MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ACTION REQUEST:  WE RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT </p><p>SPOKESMAN CONSIDER READING A STATEMENT FROM THE PODIUM </p><p>TODAY DEPLORING THIS BALD-FACED ATTEMPT TO INTIMIDATE THE </p><p>LEGITIMATE POLITICAL OPPOSITION.  A/S RICE WILL ALSO </p><p>WANT, IN HER UPCOMING MEETING WITH FM MUDENGE, </p><p>TO EXPRESS SERIOUS U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT THESE DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>OF THE LAST TWO DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
