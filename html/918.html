<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 WELLINGTON 001656 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/20/07 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, PINR, NZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  BIO REPORT: NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER JENNY SHIPLEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) WELLINGTON 1498; (B) WELLINGTON 1492 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY:  JOSIAH H. BEEMAN, AMBASSADOR. </p><p>REASONS: 1.5(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY: NZ\'S NEW (AND FIRST WOMAN) PRIME MINISTER JENNY </p><p>SHIPLEY IS AN ASTUTE POLITICIAN WHO BELIEVES IN LESS GOVERNMENT, </p><p>INDIVIDUAL EMPOWERMENT, AND A "SOFT HEART AND A HARD HEAD."  SHE </p><p>TAKES A MEASURED AND CONSULTATIVE APPROACH TO NEW ISSUES, BUT IS </p><p>NOT AFRAID TO TAKE RISKS WHEN SHE FEELS CONDITIONS MERIT ACTION. </p><p>A COMPLICATED PREGNANCY SPURRED SHIPLEY TO LEAVE THE FARM AND </p><p>BEGIN A CAREER IN POLITICS IN 1978.  ENTERING PARLIAMENT IN 1987, </p><p>SHE BEGAN A FAST RISE -- APPOINTED TO HER FIRST SHADOW CABINET </p><p>POSITION ONLY SEVENTEEN MONTHS LATER.  ONCE IN GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>1990, SHIPLEY INTRODUCED SWEEPING REFORMS IN SOCIAL WELFARE AND </p><p>HEALTH WHILE MASTERING THESE TWO DIFFICULT MINISTERIAL </p><p>PORTFOLIOS.  THE REFORMS EARNED HER THE PUBLIC\'S WRATH, BUT ALSO </p><p>THE RESPECT OF HER PARLIAMENTARY COLLEAGUES.  HER SUCCESSFUL </p><p>CHALLENGE TO BOLGER\'S LEADERSHIP OF THE NATIONAL PARTY -- WELL- </p><p>PLANNED, WELL-RESEARCHED, AND WELL-EXECUTED -- REFLECTS HER </p><p>POLITICAL CAREER TO DATE.  A HARD-WORKING POLITICIAN, RUTHLESS OR </p><p>PRAGMATIC AS NEEDED, SHIPLEY IS WELL-DISPOSED TOWARD THE U.S. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>PARSON\'S DAUGHTER </p><p>----------------- </p><p>3.  (C)  JENNIFER MARY ROBSON WAS BORN FEBRUARY 4, 1952, IN GORE, </p><p>ON NEW ZEALAND\'S SOUTH ISLAND.  SHE WAS THE SECOND OF FOUR </p><p>DAUGHTERS BORN TO A PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER AND HIS WIFE.  THE </p><p>FAMILY LIVED IN GORE AND THEN IN WELLINGTON FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER </p><p>SHIPLEY\'S BIRTH UNTIL THEY SETTLED IN BLENHEIM (NEAR THE NORTH </p><p>COAST OF THE SOUTH ISLAND), WHERE SHE SPENT THE BALANCE OF HER </p><p>CHILDHOOD.  THE FAMILY WAS NOT WEALTHY AND HAD SOME DIFFICULTY </p><p>MAKING ENDS MEET. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  SHIPLEY STATES THAT HER CORE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY ("A </p><p>SOFT HEART AND A HARD HEAD") WAS FORMULATED WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD, </p><p>WATCHING HER FATHER TEND TO HIS CONGREGATION.  HIS APPROACH, SHE </p><p>SAYS, WAS TO LEND A SYMPATHETIC EAR WHILE SHOWING PEOPLE HOW TO </p><p>EMPOWER THEMSELVES; AND TO FOCUS ON THE CAUSE OF PROBLEMS, NOT </p><p>THEIR SYMPTOMS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  SHIPLEY GREW INTO A TOMBOY AND A CHAMPIONSHIP SWIMMER </p><p>(SHE TOOK UP SWIMMING TO HELP COMBAT CHILDHOOD ASTHMA).  AN </p><p>UNDISTINGUISHED STUDENT (SHE BLAMES HER BAD GRADES ON HER LOVE </p><p>FOR SWIMMING), SHE BARELY PASSED HER HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM AND </p><p>FAILED HER UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE EXAM.  (COMMENT: SHIPLEY\'S POOR </p><p>ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND FAILURE TO PASS HER UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE </p><p>EXAM PROBABLY INDICATED A LACK OF AMBITION RATHER THAN ABILITY </p><p>AND A REALIZATION THAT, AT THE TIME, A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION WAS </p><p>NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR SUCCESS.  END COMMENT)  AT 17, SHE MET </p><p>BURTON SHIPLEY AND, TAKING THE INITIATIVE, ASKED HIM TO A BALL. </p><p>(THE COUPLE DATED FOR FOUR YEARS BEFORE GETTING MARRIED.)  AT 18, </p><p>SHIPLEY\'S FATHER DIED UNEXPECTEDLY, AND HER MOTHER BEGAN TO LIVE </p><p>ON A WIDOW\'S PENSION.  (AS SOCIAL WELFARE MINISTER MANY YEARS </p><p>LATER, SHIPLEY WOULD OVERSEE LEGISLATION THAT REDUCED THIS </p><p>BENEFIT.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>TRAUMATIC PREGNANCY SPURS CHANGE </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>6.  (C)  AFTER GRADUATING FROM CHRISTCHURCH TEACHERS COLLEGE IN </p><p>1971, SHIPLEY BEGAN TO SETTLE INTO A FAIRLY CONVENTIONAL LIFE FOR </p><p>A 19 YEAR OLD NEW ZEALAND WOMAN.  IN 1972, SHE BEGAN HER CAREER </p><p>AS A PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHER IN A CHRISTCHURCH SUBURB.  SHE JOINED </p><p>THE NATIONAL PARTY AND BECAME POLITICALLY ACTIVE, BUT IN CONTRAST </p><p>TO HER PEERS, WHO BECAME ACTIVISTS BECAUSE OF VIETNAM, SHE </p><p>FOCUSED HER ENERGIES ON COMMUNITY ISSUES (SPECIFICALLY, CHILD </p><p>CARE ISSUES: MANDATORY FENCES AROUND POOLS AND CHILD SEAT </p><p>RESTRAINTS).  AFTER MARRIAGE IN 1973, SHIPLEY SPENT THE NEXT </p><p>THREE YEARS JUGGLING HER TEACHING CAREER, FAMILY FARM DUTIES, </p><p>MARRIAGE AND INTEREST IN LOCAL POLITICS.  IN 1976, SHE DECIDED TO </p><p>QUIT TEACHING TO RAISE A FAMILY.  THE COUPLE HAD A GIRL, ANNA, IN </p><p>1977, AND A BOY, BEN, IN 1978. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  SHIPLEY HAD SEVERE DIFFICULTIES DURING BEN\'S BIRTH, </p><p>BEGAN TO HEMORRHAGE SHORTLY AFTER DELIVERY, AND WAS REPORTEDLY </p><p>NEAR DEATH.  ALONG WITH THE PHYSICAL TRAUMA, SHE WENT THROUGH A </p><p>PERIOD OF SEVERE POST-PARTUM DEPRESSION.  DURING HER </p><p>CONVALESCENCE, SHIPLEY CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT SHE WOULD NOT </p><p>BE CONTENT WITH HER LIFE AS IT WAS AND WOULD BE DOING A </p><p>DISSERVICE TO HERSELF AND HER FAMILY IF SHE DID NOT MAKE A </p><p>CHANGE.  MARRIAGE AND MOTHERHOOD, ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, BECAME </p><p>A THREAT TO HER IDENTITY.  WITH BURTON\'S BLESSING, SHIPLEY BECAME </p><p>MORE ACTIVE IN POLITICS AND MORE SERIOUS ABOUT A POLITICAL </p><p>CAREER. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  IN 1980, SHIPLEY MET HER PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATIVE, </p><p>RUTH RICHARDSON, A NATIONAL PARTY FAST-RISING RIGHT-WING ECONOMIC </p><p>RATIONALIST.  RICHARDSON, WHO ALSO HAD A FARMING BACKGROUND </p><p>(ALBEIT A WEALTHY ONE), TOOK A SHINE TO SHIPLEY AND BECAME HER </p><p>MENTOR AND GODFATHER.  RICHARDSON HELPED PAVE THE WAY FOR </p><p>SHIPLEY\'S ELEVATION FROM A CAMPAIGN EXTRA TO ELECTED POSITIONS </p><p>(THE MALVERN COUNTY COUNCIL AND THE NATIONAL PARTY\'S CANTERBURY- </p><p>WESTLAND POLICY COMMITTEE).  IN 1984, SHIPLEY RETURNED THE FAVOR </p><p>BY CAMPAIGNING HEAVILY FOR RICHARDSON\'S (SUCCESSFUL) RE-ELECTION. </p><p>(ALTHOUGH SHIPLEY SHARES RICHARDSON\'S DISLIKE FOR THE WELFARE </p><p>STATE AND PREFERENCE FOR MARKET-ORIENTED SOLUTIONS TO ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS, SHIPLEY\'S APPROACH IS LESS DOGMATIC AND SHE HAS BEEN </p><p>CAREFUL TO CHART HER OWN COURSE.  AFTER SHIPLEY ENTERED </p><p>PARLIAMENT, AND AS RICHARDSON\'S POLICIES AS AN OUTSPOKEN RADICAL </p><p>REFORMIST FINANCE MINISTER BECAME INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL, </p><p>SHIPLEY BEGAN TO PUBLICLY DISTANCE HERSELF FROM HER MENTOR.  SHE </p><p>IS NOW QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT SHE IS "NOT A RICHARDSON CLONE.") </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>QUICK RISER IN OPPOSITION... </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>9.  (C)  IN 1987, AT 35 YEARS OF AGE, SHIPLEY ANNOUNCED FOR AND </p><p>WON THE MARGINAL RURAL SEAT OF ASHBURTON (LATER RENAMED RAKAIA). </p><p>ALTHOUGH THE RETIRING NATIONAL INCUMBENT HAD HELD THE SEAT WITH A </p><p>500 VOTE MAJORITY, SHIPLEY INCREASED THAT MARGIN TO 5,000 VOTES </p><p>(THE BIGGEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE 1987 ELECTION FOR EITHER </p><p>PARTY AND AN IMPRESSIVE DEBUT).  UPON HER ELECTION, BURTON SOLD </p><p>THE FAMILY FARM AND BECAME A HOUSE-HUSBAND, WHILE SHIPLEY </p><p>COMMUTED TO PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  SHIPLEY BEGAN HER PARLIAMENTARY CAREER RANKED 38TH OUT </p><p>OF 40 NATIONAL MPS, SERVING ON THE EDUCATION AND SCIENCE </p><p>COMMITTEE.  SEVENTEEN MONTHS LATER, AFTER EXHIBITING THE HARD </p><p>WORK AND THOROUGH RESEARCH THAT HAVE BECOME HER TRADEMARK, </p><p>SHIPLEY WAS APPOINTED OPPOSITION ASSOCIATE SPOKESPERSON ON </p><p>EDUCATION BY NATIONAL LEADER JIM BOLGER (LEAP-FROGGING NATIONAL\'S </p><p>ENTIRE INTAKE OF MPS IN THE CLASS OF 1984).  A YEAR LATER, AT 39 </p><p>YEARS OF AGE, BOLGER APPOINTED SHIPLEY OPPOSITION SPOKESPERSON ON </p><p>SOCIAL WELFARE, A JUMP TO 11TH PLACE IN NATIONAL PARTY RANKINGS. </p><p>HER QUICK RISE BEGAN TO ATTRACT ATTENTION IN THE MEDIA, WHICH </p><p>DUBBED HER "MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>. . .THANKLESS GNZ PORTFOLIOS: SOCIAL WELFARE AND HEALTH </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>11.  (C)  UPON NATIONAL\'S ELECTION VICTORY IN 1990, SHIPLEY </p><p>BECAME MINISTER FOR SOCIAL WELFARE (THE GOVERNMENT\'S LARGEST </p><p>SPENDING PORTFOLIO) AND MINISTER FOR WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS.  IT WOULD </p><p>BE THE FIRST OF TWO POLITICALLY THANKLESS PORTFOLIOS PM BOLGER </p><p>WOULD HAND SHIPLEY (IN AN ATTEMPT BY BOLGER TO TEMPER HER </p><p>METEORIC RISE, ACCORDING TO SOME OBSERVERS).  AS MINISTER FOR </p><p>SOCIAL WELFARE, SHIPLEY PRESIDED OVER "THE MOST EXTENSIVE REVAMP </p><p>OF THE WELFARE STATE" TO DATE.  SHE FIRST CAPPED THEN CUT WELFARE </p><p>BENEFITS TO THE UNEMPLOYED, RETIREES AND WIDOWS BY AS MUCH AS 25 </p><p>PER CENT.  DURING THIS TIME, SHIPLEY DEVELOPED A REPUTATION FOR </p><p>RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY AND, IN SOME EYES, BECAME THE HARD FACE OF AN </p><p>UNCARING GOVERNMENT.  IN INSTITUTING DIFFICULT POLICY DECISIONS, </p><p>SHE EARNED THE PUBLIC\'S IRE (SHE WAS BURNED IN EFFIGY SEVERAL </p><p>TIMES), BUT ALSO ITS GRUDGING RESPECT AS WELL AS THE ADMIRATION </p><p>OF HER PARLIAMENTARY COLLEAGUES.  SHE ALSO DEVELOPED FINE </p><p>DEBATING SKILLS, IN CONFRONTING LABOUR\'S THEN SOCIAL WELFARE </p><p>SPOKESPERSON (AND CURRENT DEPUTY LEADER) MICHAEL CULLEN -- ONE OF </p><p>LABOUR\'S SHARPEST PARLIAMENTARY DEBATERS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  AFTER NATIONAL\'S SUCCESSFUL RE-ELECTION IN 1993, </p><p>SHIPLEY WAS REWARDED FOR HER DEFT HANDLING OF THE DIFFICULT </p><p>SOCIAL WELFARE PORTFOLIO WITH A JUMP IN CABINET (FROM 11TH TO 5TH </p><p>PLACE--THE BIGGEST PROMOTION IN THAT CABINET SHUFFLE), BUT WITH </p><p>ANOTHER DIFFICULT JOB.  AS MINISTER OF HEALTH, SHIPLEY WAS ASKED </p><p>AGAIN TO CAP AND THEN CUT PUBLIC SPENDING.  SHIPLEY MANAGED HER </p><p>PORTFOLIO WELL, AND INTRODUCED MANY OF THE CUTS IN UNIVERSAL </p><p>HEALTH BENEFITS THAT ARE ONLY NOW COMING INTO BEING -- TO THE </p><p>CONCERN OF MANY NEW ZEALANDERS.  (HEALTH CUTS REMAIN AN ACHILLES </p><p>HEEL FOR NATIONAL, AND WILL PROBABLY REMAIN A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE </p><p>IN THE RUN-UP TO THE NEXT ELECTION, REQUIRED NO LATER THAN </p><p>OCTOBER 1999.) </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C)  WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF MIXED-MEMBER PROPORTIONAL </p><p>(MMP) PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION IN THE 1996 ELECTION AND THE </p><p>FORMATION OF A NATIONAL-NEW ZEALAND FIRST (NZF) COALITION IN </p><p>DECEMBER 1996, SHIPLEY HAD REPORTEDLY HOPED FOR A RESPITE AND A </p><p>REWARD WITH A JUNIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO.  INSTEAD, SHE </p><p>BECAME MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT, STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES AND STATE </p><p>SERVICES (SHE WOULD LATER REGAIN THE WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO </p><p>AND RELINQUISH THE STATE SERVICES PORTFOLIO).  ONCE AGAIN, </p><p>HOWEVER, SHE THREW HERSELF INTO HER WORK, ACHIEVING OPEN SKIES </p><p>AGREEMENTS WITH THE U.S., SINGAPORE, MALAYSIA AND NEW AVIATION </p><p>LIBERALIZATION ACCORDS WITH THE UK AND SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (C)  UPON THE FORMATION OF THE COALITION, SUPPORT FOR PM </p><p>BOLGER BEGAN TO SLIDE WITHIN HIS PARTY AND IN PUBLIC OPINION </p><p>POLLS.  AT THE SAME TIME, SHIPLEY\'S STATURE BEGAN TO GROW WITHIN </p><p>THE PARTY AND ON THE STREET.  THE MEDIA PICKED UP THE DRUMBEAT </p><p>AND, FOR SOME TIME, PALACE COUP RUMORS AROUND PARLIAMENT BECAME </p><p>COMMONPLACE. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  SHIPLEY\'S STATURE WAS FURTHER ENHANCED AS SHE BEGAN TO </p><p>DISTANCE HERSELF PUBLICLY FROM NATIONAL\'S COALITION PARTNER AND </p><p>NZF\'S CONTROVERSIAL LEADER, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER </p><p>WINSTON PETERS.  AMIDST PETERS\'S DEMANDS DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>TO FORM THE COALITION, SHIPLEY ASKED, "HOW MANY RATS DO WE HAVE </p><p>TO SWALLOW?"  LATER, SHE PUBLICLY OPPOSED A REFERENDUM ON </p><p>COMPULSORY RETIREMENT SAVINGS CHAMPIONED BY PETERS THAT LOST BY </p><p>MORE THAN 90 PER CENT OF THE VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (C)  AMIDST BOLGER\'S LANGUISHING POLLS AND DURING HIS VISIT </p><p>TO THE COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING IN SCOTLAND AND </p><p>TO PARIS IN EARLY NOVEMBER, SHIPLEY LAUNCHED A SECRETIVE, WELL- </p><p>PLANNED AND SUCCESSFUL LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE IN THE NATIONAL </p><p>CAUCUS.  AFTER INTENSE BEHIND-THE-SCENES NEGOTIATIONS, BOLGER </p><p>RESIGNED IN FAVOR OF SHIPLEY AS PARTY LEADER ON NOVEMBER 3. </p><p>(SOME OBSERVERS SPECULATED AT THE TIME THAT THE BAD BLOOD BETWEEN </p><p>PETERS AND SHIPLEY WOULD PROVE INSURMOUNTABLE AND THAT PETERS </p><p>WOULD PULL OUT OF THE COALITION UPON SHIPLEY\'S ACCESSION. </p><p>INDEED, PETERS EXPLORED FORMING A GOVERNMENT WITH LABOUR AFTER </p><p>SHIPLEY BECAME NATIONAL\'S LEADER, BUT RETURNED TO THE COALITION </p><p>AFTER LABOUR TURNED HIM DOWN (REF A).  AFFIRMING THEIR </p><p>PRAGMATISM, SHIPLEY AND PETERS HAVE REPORTEDLY SINCE PATCHED OVER </p><p>THEIR DIFFERENCES.)  SHOWING A DEGREE OF SENSITIVITY, SHE GAVE </p><p>BOLGER A DECENT FINAL INTERVAL AS PM, ALLOWING HIM TO TRAVEL TO </p><p>THE VANCOUVER APEC SUMMIT AND TO VISIT CHINA AS SCHEDULED.  ON </p><p>DECEMBER 8, AFTER ONLY TEN YEARS IN PARLIAMENT, SHIPLEY WAS SWORN </p><p>IN AS NEW ZEALAND\'S FIRST WOMAN PRIME MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>SHIPLEY TODAY </p><p>------------- </p><p>17.  (C)  JENNY SHIPLEY DESCRIBES HERSELF AS "CONSERVATIVE </p><p>CENTER-RIGHT."  HER POLICY INTERESTS ARE MICROECONOMIC REFORM, </p><p>WOMEN\'S ISSUES, EDUCATION AND SOCIAL ISSUES.  WITHIN THE NATIONAL </p><p>PARTY, HER CREDENTIALS ON ECONOMIC REFORM ARE SOLID.  HOWEVER, </p><p>HER LIBERAL LEANINGS ON SOCIAL ISSUES (BIRTH CONTROL, SEX </p><p>EDUCATION, WOMEN\'S ISSUES, GAY RIGHTS) HAVE ALLOWED HER TO CLAIM </p><p>NEW TERRITORY FOR NATIONAL (WHICH MAY PROVE VALUABLE IN </p><p>ATTRACTING THE FEMALE UNDECIDED VOTE IN FUTURE ELECTIONS), BUT </p><p>HAVE ALSO OCCASIONALLY ANGERED SOME OF HER PARTY COLLEAGUES AND </p><p>AMUSED OTHERS.  (IN ONE UNUSUAL CAUCUS MEETING, SHIPLEY OFFERED </p><p>TO EDUCATE NATIONAL MPS ON HOW TO EXAMINE THEMSELVES FOR SEXUALLY </p><p>TRANSMITTED DISEASES.  HER EMBARRASSED COLLEAGUES DECLINED.) </p><p> </p><p>18.  (C)  SHIPLEY DESCRIBES HER APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE AS ONE OF </p><p>SELF-RELIANCE -- STRESSING INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND </p><p>DISCIPLINE.  SHE DEEMS HER COMMUNICATION SKILLS TO BE HER BEST </p><p>ASSET, ONCE BOASTING PUBLICLY THAT SHE COULD "SELL RICE TO A </p><p>CHINAMAN."  WHILE NOT AN ACADEMIC OR AN IDEAS PERSON, SHIPLEY HAS </p><p>POLITICAL SMARTS, SEIZES HER PORTFOLIO, LEARNS IT INSIDE AND OUT, </p><p>AND STAYS CURRENT.  SHE IS ALSO A GOOD MANAGER AND HAS ASSEMBLED </p><p>ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST, MOST LOYAL STAFFS IN PARLIAMENT.  OBSERVERS </p><p>HAVE CHARACTERIZED HER AS ICY, CORRECT, UNFLAPPABLE, AND ABLE TO </p><p>WORDLESSLY CONVEY THE SCHOOL-TEACHER-LIKE MESSAGE OF "DON\'T MESS </p><p>WITH ME."  SHIPLEY STATES THAT HER CHRISTIAN FAITH IS IMPORTANT </p><p>TO HER, BUT RARELY TALKS ABOUT RELIGION IN PUBLIC.  SHE IS </p><p>INTERESTED IN WATER SPORTS AND LIKES TO SPEND HER FREE TIME WITH </p><p>FAMILY, GARDENING, READING AND COOKING OUT ON THE BARBECUE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>SHIPLEY\'S FEELING TOWARDS THE U.S. </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>19.  (C)  THE PM HAS WARM FEELINGS TOWARDS THE U.S.  WHEN SHIPLEY </p><p>FIRST ENTERED PARLIAMENT, SHE OFTEN ATTENDED USG FUNCTIONS BUT </p><p>NOW DOES SO LESS FREQUENTLY DUE TO HER BUSY SCHEDULE.  IN APRIL </p><p>1989, SHIPLEY WENT TO THE U.S. ON A USIS IV GRANT TO LOOK AT </p><p>ORGANIC FOOD AND GREENHOUSE GAS ISSUES.  ALTHOUGH SHIPLEY IS </p><p>WELL-DISPOSED TO THE U.S., SHE IS HER OWN PERSON AND TAKES </p><p>POSITIONS THAT ARE IN HER OWN PERCEIVED INTEREST.  LIKE MANY OF </p><p>HER NATIONAL PARTY COLLEAGUES IN THE RUN-UP TO THE 1990 ELECTION, </p><p>SHE DID NOT OPPOSE NATIONAL\'S ADOPTION OF LABOUR\'S ANTI-NUCLEAR </p><p>POLICY (BELIEVING THAT TO DO SO WOULD HARM NATIONAL\'S ELECTION </p><p>PROSPECTS).  IN THE WAKE OF HER FIRST FOREIGN INTERVIEW AFTER </p><p>BECOMING PARTY LEADER, SHIPLEY TOOK TO THE FLOOR OF PARLIAMENT TO </p><p>REFUTE A SYDNEY MORNING HERALD ARTICLE THAT STATED SHE WOULD </p><p>RECONSIDER NZ\'S ANTI-NUCLEAR POLICY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>(REF B).  SHIPLEY\'S CLARIFICATION EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED (FOR THE </p><p>TIME BEING) ANY CHANCE THAT SHE MIGHT PUSH FOR A CHANGE IN NZ\'S </p><p>NUCLEAR POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>HUSBAND, BURTON SHIPLEY </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>20.  (C)  MARRIED TO SHIPLEY FOR 24 YEARS, BURTON SHIPLEY IS A 45 </p><p>YEAR OLD, MID-LEVEL FINANCIAL ADVISOR WITH WESTPAC BANK.  A </p><p>FARMER BY TRADE, HE BECAME A FULL-TIME HOUSEHUSBAND FOR TWO YEARS </p><p>(RAISING TWO CHILDREN), WHILE HIS WIFE COMMUTED TO PARLIAMENT. </p><p>ONCE THEIR CHILDREN ENTERED BOARDING SCHOOL, BURTON LEFT THE FARM </p><p>AND WORKED AS A LOBBYIST FOR THE DEER FARMERS\' ASSOCIATION, AND </p><p>THEN AS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR FOR MONEY MANAGERS BEFORE JOINING </p><p>WESTPAC.  AT 6\'4", BURTON IS OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR HIS WIFE\'S </p><p>BODYGUARD.  HE IS A FORMER BASKETBALL PLAYER (JUST MISSING OUT ON </p><p>NEW ZEALAND\'S NATIONAL TEAM), AND CURRENTLY ENJOYS SAILING.  NOT </p><p>SHY ABOUT VOICING HIS OPINIONS (TO HIS WIFE AND, AT LEAST BEFORE </p><p>HER ACCESSION TO PM, TO OTHERS), BURTON SAYS HE IS FURTHER RIGHT </p><p>THAN HIS WIFE AND GOOD AT IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS, BUT NOT THEIR </p><p>SOLUTIONS.  BOTH THEIR CHILDREN ATTEND CANTERBURY UNIVERSITY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID ABOUT SHIPLEY </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>21.  (C)  HOW OTHERS SEE SHIPLEY IS ILLUMINATING: </p><p> </p><p>-- NATIONAL PARTY PM ROBERT MULDOON DESCRIBED SHIPLEY AS: "...A </p><p>FRONT ROW RUGBY PROP...BASICALLY A NICE PERSON, BUT IF YOU THINK </p><p>A MIDDLE-AGED, OVER-WEIGHT FARMER\'S WIFE CAN REMAKE THE WELFARE </p><p>SYSTEM THEN YOU\'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND." </p><p> </p><p>-- LABOR DEPUTY LEADER AND FINANCIAL SPOKESPERSON MICHAEL CULLEN </p><p>CALLED SHIPLEY (AS SOCIAL WELFARE MINISTER): "THE MOST HATED </p><p>MINISTER IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY." </p><p> </p><p>-- FORMER NEW ZEALAND FIRST MP AND CURRENT NATIONAL COMMENTATOR </p><p>MICHAEL LAWS RECENTLY CALLED SHIPLEY: "THE HUMAN FACE OF THE </p><p>SPANISH INQUISITION...THE SILENT MENACE OF NEW ZEALAND </p><p>POLITICS...SHE CAN TELL YOU IN WONDERFUL WARM TONES HOW SHE IS </p><p>GOING TO GARROTTE YOU AND THEN THROW YOUR INTESTINES OVER HER </p><p>LEFT SHOULDER." </p><p> </p><p>-- FORMER LABOR PM DAVID LANGE RECENTLY DESCRIBED HER AS: </p><p>"...TOUGHER THAN ANY MAN IN CABINET...THE ONLY WORTHY NATIONAL </p><p>OPPONENT SINCE MULDOON...BEATING HER IS LIKE BEATING SOUTH AFRICA </p><p>(IN RUGBY)." </p><p> </p><p>22.  (C)  COMMENT:  IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO REDUCE SHIPLEY TO A </p><p>RICHARDSON-CLONE, A THATCHER-CLONE OR "BOLGER IN A FROCK."  SHE </p><p>IS A SMART, HARD-WORKING POLITICIAN, ALTERNATELY RUTHLESS AND </p><p>PRAGMATIC AS NEEDED.  SHE WILL TRY TO AVOID BOLGER\'S MISTAKE OF </p><p>BEING SEEN AS TOO CHUMMY WITH NZF AND PETERS AND ISOLATED FROM </p><p>NATIONAL\'S BACKBENCH.  NONETHELESS, THE NEW PM REALIZES THAT </p><p>UNDER MMP, NATIONAL\'S RE-ELECTION HOPES RIDE ON A WELL-RUN </p><p>COALITION THAT ADDRESSES IMPORTANT DOMESTIC ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>BEEMAN </p><p></p></div>
