<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 OTTAWA 002125 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, ENRG, TRGY, CA, Energy </p><p>SUBJECT: CANADA: HIGH ON HYDROGEN </p><p> </p><p>REF: REF: (A) STATE 146268 (B) OTTAWA 01721 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  This cable provides an overview of Canada\'s </p><p>public and private efforts to develop technologies for the </p><p>use of hydrogen as a fuel.  Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) </p><p>is drafting a detailed national plan for directing Canadian </p><p>hydrogen efforts ("Canadian Hydrogen Roadmap"), but it is at </p><p>least one year away from completion, according to GOC </p><p>officials.  On April 15, Industry Canada released its </p><p>"Canadian Fuel Cell Commercialisation Roadmap," a document </p><p>that will complement the expected "Hydrogen Roadmap." </p><p>Research teams at the National Research Council (NRC) labs in </p><p>Ottawa and Vancouver are working on the next generation of </p><p>PEM (proton-exchange membrane) and solid oxide fuel cell </p><p>(SOFC) components to find ways to lower the cost, reduce the </p><p>size, and improve the efficiency of fuel cells.  High-profile </p><p>Canadian corporations, some of them world leaders in their </p><p>field, are also doing their part to spur the development of </p><p>hydrogen-related technology and infrastructure in Canada (see </p><p>paras 10-11).  Given its expertise in some hydrogen </p><p>technologies, Canada could contribute significantly to the </p><p>development of the hydrogen economy in North America, and we </p><p>recommend continued close collaboration between governments </p><p>and the private sectors of the US and Canada.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GOC:  BRING ON THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Canadian Government (GOC) has made a multi-agency </p><p>commitment to developing the hydrogen economy.  Natural </p><p>Resources Canada\'s (NRCan\'s) hydrogen-related research and </p><p>development (H2 R&D) is handled by the CANMET Energy </p><p>Technology Centre (CETC).  Vesna Scepanovic, Hydrogen and </p><p>Fuel Cell Program Manager of the CETC, highlighted for Emboff </p><p>the GOC\'s strong interest in supporting private H2 R&D, as </p><p>well as performing some of its own.  She emphasized NRCan\'s </p><p>leading role in 20 years of H2 R&D for a total expenditure of </p><p>C$183 million (US$133 million), not including the new </p><p>Canadian Transportation Fuel Cell Alliance (see para 3).  She </p><p>pointed out that more recently involved GOC agencies include </p><p>Transport Canada, the National Research Council (NRC), and </p><p>Environment Canada.  Scepanovic said that Industry Canada and </p><p>the Department of National Defence (DND) are becoming more </p><p>interested in the use of hydrogen, as shown by Industry </p><p>Canada\'s release of the Fuel Cell Commercialisation Roadmap </p><p>in April (see paras 7-9).  Scepanovic mentioned that NRCan is </p><p>currently working on a Canadian Hydrogen Roadmap that will </p><p>take at least one year to develop.  She commented that it </p><p>should have predated the Fuel Cell Roadmap because the new </p><p>Hydrogen Roadmap will be a more comprehensive plan, </p><p>including, but not limited to, fuel cell technology. </p><p> </p><p>3.  In 2000, under the Canadian Climate Change Action Plan, </p><p>CETC created the Canadian Transportation Fuel Cell Alliance </p><p>(CTFCA).  The CTFCA is an organization that brings together </p><p>more than 60 universities, private companies, and government </p><p>agencies.  Richard Fry, CTFCA\'s Fuel Cell Infrastructure </p><p>Program Manager, told Emboff that his program will receive </p><p>C$23 million (US$17 million) over five years (ending in 2005) </p><p>through NRCan to fund projects on hydrogen fueling stations </p><p>and demonstrations of hydrogen production from methanol, </p><p>natural gas, electrolysis, and recovery of waste hydrogen. </p><p>Fry acknowledged some GOC interest in hydrogen production </p><p>from nuclear power sources and observed that Geoffrey </p><p>Ballard, founder of Canadian fuel cell producer Ballard </p><p>Power, publicly supports the idea.  However, Fry and other </p><p>officials indicate a preference for renewable sources of </p><p>hydrogen production, although current government funding of </p><p>wind and solar projects is weak.  For now Canada continues to </p><p>produce the majority of its hydrogen from fossil fuels. </p><p>Major CTFCA partners include Ballard Power Systems, Ford </p><p>Motor Company, Hydrogenics Corporation, QuestAir </p><p>Technologies, and Stuart Energy Systems (for more details on </p><p>these Canadian companies see para 10). </p><p> </p><p>4.  The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) does </p><p>significant research related to PEM (proton-exchange </p><p>membrane) fuel cells and SOFCs (solid-oxide fuel cells). </p><p>Senior researchers in Ottawa are applying their expertise and </p><p>lab capacity in materials science towards specific fuel cell </p><p>applications, while a more focused fuel cell program is </p><p>growing at NRC\'s Institute for Fuel Cell Innovation in </p><p>Vancouver.  One project involves reducing the amount of </p><p>platinum needed in fuel cell catalysts, which could </p><p>drastically lower their cost.  NRC officials emphasize that </p><p>they are a "crown corporation" distinct from the GOC (which </p><p>in any case provides most of their funding).  NRCan and its </p><p>CANMET labs form the epicenter of GOC hydrogen research and </p><p>policy. </p><p> </p><p>KYOTO RATIFICATION PROVIDES IMPETUS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>5.  The GOC ratified the Kyoto protocol in late 2002 and </p><p>views hydrogen as a potential tool for important reductions </p><p>in greenhouse gas emissions.  Technology Early Action </p><p>Measures (TEAM), a division of the Climate Change Action Fund </p><p>(CCAF), provides investment for technology that promises to </p><p>reduce emissions while sustaining social and economic </p><p>development.  TEAM, which encourages clean energy solutions </p><p>that can be marketed quickly, was initially budgeted C$60 </p><p>million (US$44 million) from its inception in 1998 to 2001. </p><p>An additional C$35 million (US$25 million) will see it </p><p>through to 2004.  In one example of hydrogen technology </p><p>investment, TEAM provided C$1.1 million (US$822,000) for an </p><p>Ontario Power Technologies project in 2000 to build a </p><p>prototype heat and power plant to run on fuel cells. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Hydrogen has also attracted attention and funding from </p><p>Technology Partnerships Canada (TPC), a loan program that </p><p>supports private sector R&D.  For example, TPC invested </p><p>C$4.34 million (US$3.24 million) in Stuart Energy Systems in </p><p>1999 for the design of a cost-effective refueling system for </p><p>hydrogen-powered buses. </p><p> </p><p>"CANADIAN FUEL CELL COMMERCIALISATION ROADMAP" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>7.  Industry Minister Allan Rock released the "Canadian Fuel </p><p>Cell Commercialisation Roadmap" on April 15 of this year </p><p>(information available at www.strategis.ic.gc.ca).  In it, </p><p>the GOC identifies the economic and environmental goals of H2 </p><p>fuel cell development, such as cleaner air and lower </p><p>climate-changing emissions levels (towards Kyoto </p><p>requirements).  It views hydrogen as an important energy </p><p>resource for transportation, heating, and power generation. </p><p>The GOC believes it holds a world leadership position in this </p><p>sector and endorses the roadmap as a way to maintain a </p><p>Canadian edge in a global hydrogen economy.  The Roadmap </p><p>profiles no fewer than 96 Canadian players, 42 of which are </p><p>GOC agencies (Environment Canada, TPC, NRCan\'s TEAM, Industry </p><p>Canada, Transport Canada) or NGOs (CHA, Fuel Cells Canada). </p><p>The other 54 profiles are broken into three categories:  Fuel </p><p>Cell Producers (Hydrogenics, Ballard Power), Parts and </p><p>Systems Suppliers (QuestAir, Vandenborre), and Fueling </p><p>Infrastructure (Stuart Energy).  (For details on these </p><p>participants see para 10). </p><p> </p><p>8.  Most economic data in the Roadmap is from 2001.  The GOC </p><p>estimates 1,800 Canadian jobs are directly connected and </p><p>dedicated to the fuel cell industry, 76% of which are located </p><p>in Western Canada (concentrated in British Columbia).  This </p><p>number is thought to have remained stable over the last two </p><p>years and represents mostly university and community college </p><p>graduates.  According to the GOC, 2001 fuel cell industry </p><p>revenues were estimated at C$96.9 million (US$70.1 million), </p><p>with 70% coming from Western Canada.  The GOC predicts 70% </p><p>revenue growth between 2001 and 2003, resulting in an </p><p>estimated C$165.2 million (US$119.5 million) in Canadian fuel </p><p>cell industry revenue this year.  For purposes of comparison, </p><p>the US fuel cell market is estimated to be worth about US$1.4 </p><p>billion this year (according to a report from the Business </p><p>Communications Company, Inc., website www.bccresearch.com). </p><p>Using those numbers, the Canadian fuel cell market is roughly </p><p>5% the value of the US fuel cell market, which may seem </p><p>insignificant until one realizes that 2002 nominal Canadian </p><p>GDP was about 7% of US GDP.  Thus one can see that the fuel </p><p>cell market is playing an equally important role in the </p><p>Canadian economy proportionate to the US fuel cell market and </p><p>economy. </p><p> </p><p>ROADMAP TO GREATER EFFICIENCY </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  The "Roadmap" recommends strategies to stimulate early </p><p>market demand by showcasing technology and educating the </p><p>public.  To improve product quality while reducing cost, the </p><p>Roadmap promotes information sharing and the adoption of </p><p>common performance and technical standards between </p><p>researchers and developers, the private sector, and academic </p><p>institutions.  To help in the financing of H2 fuel cell R&D, </p><p>the Roadmap proposes tax incentives and matching funds for </p><p>related investments.  The GOC intends to "take a lead role in </p><p>setting codes and standards for fuel, fuel cells, and fueling </p><p>systems."  The Roadmap concludes with the goal of "developing </p><p>a national fuel cell strategy within the next year" and </p><p>incorporating Roadmap working groups into Fuel Cells Canada, </p><p>an industry association that actually began as part of </p><p>Industry Canada (see para 14). </p><p> </p><p>SAMPLING OF CANADIAN COMPANIES RECEIVING GOC FUNDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>10.  The bulk of Canadian private sector H2 R&D efforts (87% </p><p>of all Canadian fuel cell R&D) is clustered around Vancouver, </p><p>British Columbia (B.C.), only 150 miles north of Seattle. </p><p>Another center of private hydrogen activity is in the Toronto </p><p>area.  Following is a summary of some major private sector </p><p>players with their location, their focus, and their GOC </p><p>funding: </p><p> </p><p>COMPANY:  Ballard Power Systems </p><p>   LOCATION:  Burnaby, B.C. (Vancouver area) </p><p>   FOCUS/PRODUCT:  World leader of PEM (proton exchange </p><p>                   membrane) fuel cell manufacturing. </p><p>   GOC FUNDING:  CETC funds in early 90s for fuel cells in </p><p>                 city buses; C$8m (US$5.8m) from NRCan, </p><p>                 Industry Canada, Environment Canada,and </p><p>                 Transport Canada for fuel cells in Ford </p><p>                 cars. </p><p> </p><p>COMPANY:  QuestAir Technologies </p><p>   LOCATION:  Burnaby, B.C. (Vancouver area) </p><p>   FOCUS/PRODUCT:  Hydrogen and methane harvesting through </p><p>                   gas purification and separation. </p><p>   GOC FUNDING:  C$9.6m (US$7m) from TPC for H2 </p><p>                 purification technology R&D.  Government </p><p>                 of British Columbia has also funded </p><p>                 QuestAir R&D. </p><p> </p><p>COMPANY:  Stuart Energy, owns Vandenborre Hydrogen </p><p>          Technologies (formerly Belgian) </p><p>   LOCATION:  Mississauga, Ontario (Toronto area) </p><p>   FOCUS/PRODUCT:  Hydrogen refueling and power back-up </p><p>                   systems.  Active in European and Asian </p><p>                   markets. </p><p>   GOC FUNDING:  C$5.8m (US$4.2m) from TPC and CCAF for </p><p>                 cost-effective and reliable method of </p><p>                 refueling hydrogen fuel cell buses. </p><p> </p><p>COMPANY:  Hydrogenics Corporation </p><p>   LOCATION:  Mississauga, Ontario (Toronto area) </p><p>   FOCUS/PRODUCT:  Constructs power generation systems </p><p>                   based on PEM fuel cells.  Named Canada\'s </p><p>                   fastest growing company during last 5 </p><p>                   years by PROFIT magazine. </p><p>   GOC FUNDING:  C$500,000 (US$364,000) from NRCan for </p><p>                 10-kilowatt fuel cell power module for use </p><p>                 in forklifts, utility and mining vehicles. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SOME CANADIAN COMPANIES ARE WORLD LEADERS IN THEIR FIELD </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  The above list details only four of a large group of </p><p>Canadian companies making significant steps forward in the </p><p>development of hydrogen technology.  The following Canadian </p><p>firms are considered to be among the world\'s leaders in their </p><p>fields: </p><p> </p><p>Ballard Power </p><p>     PEM (proton-exchange membrane) technology </p><p> </p><p>Dynetek </p><p>     Compressed hydrogen storage </p><p> </p><p>Greenlight Division of Hydrogenics </p><p>     Fuel cell systems testing </p><p> </p><p>HERA Hydrogen Storage Systems </p><p>     Hydrogen storage in light-weight hydride materials </p><p>     and R&D on carbon-based materials for H2 storage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HYDROGEN ECONOMY OFF TO A GOOD START </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>12.  The Canadian private sector foresees strong consumer </p><p>demand for hydrogen-powered products in the near future and </p><p>many products are already on the market.  Stuart Energy has </p><p>mobile and permanent hydrogen refueling stations running; </p><p>Hydrogenics offers portable and stationary hydrogen-run power </p><p>generators; Ballard fuel cells are in both Coleman Powermate </p><p>generators and Daimler/Chrysler buses and cars.  According to </p><p>Stuart Energy, modifying a current internal combustion engine </p><p>to run on hydrogen (cutting emissions dramatically) costs </p><p>only about US$700, meaning that large numbers of Canadians </p><p>(and Americans) could be driving hydrogen-powered vehicles </p><p>today.  Companies such as Stuart Energy that are not </p><p>primarily involved with fuel cell technology (whose practical </p><p>applications are still 15-20 years away) see the \'hydrogen </p><p>economy\' as a more immediate subset of the larger economy. </p><p>Instead of replacing contemporary energy sources, hydrogen </p><p>can complement them and help optimize their use through its </p><p>ability to store energy during off-peak hours for emergency </p><p>use during times of heavy demand. </p><p> </p><p>BUSINESS ACROSS THE BORDER </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  Private sector players in the US and Canada are showing </p><p>a healthy degree of teamwork with regard to hydrogen </p><p>technology and applications.  Companies on both sides of the </p><p>border belong to the same H2 industry organizations (Ballard </p><p>Power, for example, is a member of the Canadian Fuel Cell </p><p>Partnership, and Ford Motor Company is a partner of the </p><p>Canadian Transportation Fuel Cell Alliance).  Some companies </p><p>are conducting joint projects; for instance, US General </p><p>Motors is working with Canadian firms Hydrogenics and General </p><p>Hydrogen, and Ford is working with Stuart Energy and Ballard </p><p>Power.  Canadian and American businesses would both benefit </p><p>from a compatible, balanced and strong hydrogen </p><p>infrastructure on both sides of the border, so they have an </p><p>incentive to cooperate in working towards that goal.  GOC </p><p>officials confirmed that any multinational with an office </p><p>based in Canada qualifies for hydrogen-related government </p><p>funds, which might make American private investment in </p><p>hydrogen projects in Canada even more attractive. </p><p> </p><p>H2 INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS IN CANADA </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  A host of organizations have sprung up in efforts to </p><p>coordinate the hydrogen-related activities of industries, </p><p>universities, research institutions, the GOC and provincial </p><p>governments.  Two examples are Fuel Cells Canada (based in </p><p>the NRC\'s Institute for Fuel Cell Innovation in Vancouver) </p><p>and the Canadian Hydrogen Association (CHA, offices in </p><p>Toronto and Montreal).  Fuel Cells Canada, a non-profit </p><p>industry association that began with support from the </p><p>National Research Council (NRC), provides support and </p><p>services for continuing demonstration, development, and </p><p>deployment of hydrogen fuel cell technology.  The CHA, also </p><p>non-profit, sponsors and organizes meetings and conferences </p><p>for its members and promotes educational activities in </p><p>schools.  CHA members include Ballard Power, Dynetek, General </p><p>Hydrogen, Hydrogenics, and Stuart Energy.  These two </p><p>associations form the industry framework for plans like the </p><p>Fuel Cell Commercialisation Roadmap that call for a wide </p><p>variety of players dealing in different sectors of the </p><p>hydrogen economy. </p><p> </p><p>US-CANADIAN COORDINATION: KEEPING THE LIGHT ON </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>15.  Although NRCan already collaborates with DOE on hydrogen </p><p>safety standards and educational outreach projects, their </p><p>hydrogen managers at the working level are eager for further </p><p>bilateral coordination.  Fortunately NRCan officials say that </p><p>they do not feel they are duplicating US H2 R&D efforts. </p><p>While both countries\' scientists are researching many of the </p><p>same issues, they are "developing very specific </p><p>technologies."  In the recent bilateral energy consultations </p><p>held in Ottawa, the GOC committed to participation in the </p><p>International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy (IPHE, REF </p><p>A), despite concerns of potential overlapping with the </p><p>International Energy Agency\'s (IEA\'s) Hydrogen Control Group </p><p>(HCG) (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>16.  COMMENT:  While the GOC has a long track record of fuel </p><p>cell funding and research, its attention to the significant </p><p>matters of hydrogen production, storage, and transport is </p><p>relatively new.  These areas would benefit greatly from </p><p>USG-GOC coordination.  It is still unclear to some GOC </p><p>officials how best to engage in successful North American H2 </p><p>R&D collaboration with the US, which they all agree is very </p><p>desirable.  Post believes that US and Canadian bilateral and </p><p>multilateral cooperation on hydrogen technologies will help </p><p>cement both countries\' leading positions in the coming global </p><p>hydrogen economy.  END COMMENT. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
