(C) SUMMARY: ITALY\'S RAILWAY COMPANY, FERROVIE DELLO STATO </p><p>(FS), WHOSE HOLDINGS INCLUDE THE NATIONAL RAILWAY SERVICE AND </p><p>RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS, IS ON AN ECONOMIC UPSWING DUE </p><p>TO A FAVORABLE MARKET AND SMART MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.  TO </p><p>BOLSTER ITS BOTTOM LINE, FS IS FOCUSING ON INCREASING </p><p>CAPACITY, SPEED, AND RELIABILITY IN PASSENGER SERVICES, </p><p>MAINLY THROUGH THE CREATION OF A HIGH-SPEED RAIL NETWORK. </p><p>DESPITE THE MORE POSITIVE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF FS, THE GOI </p><p>HAS NO PLANS TO PRIVATIZE THIS GOI ASSET.  U.S. COMPANIES MAY </p><p>STILL FIND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SECTOR, INCLUDING </p><p>THE PROVISION OF HIGH-TECH GOODS AND SERVICES, AND IN THE </p><p>LOCAL AND REGIONAL PASSENGER AND CARGO MARKET.  FS OFFICIALS </p><p>REALIZE THAT THE RAILWAY NETWORK IS CRITICAL NATIONAL </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE THAT COULD BE TARGETED BY TERRORISTS AND HAVE </p><p>HEIGHTENED SECURITY MEASURES SINCE SEPTEMBER 11.  EMBOFFS </p><p>PLAN TO ATTEND, AS OBSERVERS, AN OCTOBER 2002 MEETING IN ROME </p><p>OF EUROPEAN RAILWAY SECURITY OFFICIALS TO ENGAGE THE GOI ON </p><p>THIS AND POSSIBLY OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>---------- </p><p>2. (SBU) ECONOFF HELD A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH SENIOR </p><p>RAILWAY OFFICIALS TO GAUGE THE STATE OF THE SECTOR\'S </p><p>LIBERALIZATION AND TO DISCUSS ITALIAN RAILWAY INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>SECURITY IN THE POST-9/11 WORLD.  OUR IMPRESSION IS THAT OF A </p><p>RAILWAY SECTOR ON THE ECONOMIC UPSWING, WITH BUSINESS </p><p>DIRECTORS MODERNIZING SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE, AND </p><p>WITH SECURITY DIRECTORS WHO HAVE IMPROVED SECURITY OVER THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02912  01 OF 04  141435Z </p><p>PAST YEAR.  INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM WE SPOKE INCLUDE: MARIA </p><p>COSTA, DIRECTOR OF FOREIGN RELATIONS OF FS (THE ITALIAN </p><p>NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY); VINCENZO SOPRANO, DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OF FS; ENZO CELLI, DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR </p><p>RAILROADS OF THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURES (MOT); GIOVANNI SATTA, DIRECTOR OF </p><p>FEDERTRASPORTO, A CONFEDERATION OF ITALIAN TRANSPORTATION </p><p>ASSOCIATIONS; DAMIANO TOSELLI, CORPORATE SECURITY DIRECTOR OF </p><p>FS; FRANCO FIUMARA, SECURITY DIRECTOR OF THE ITALIAN RAILWAY </p><p>NETWORK (RFI), AN FS HOLDING; AND RICCARDO MATTEI OF THE </p><p>RAILWAY CONSULTING FIRM STEER DAVIES GLEAVE. </p><p> </p><p>SNAPSHOT OF THE RAILWAY SYSTEM </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>3. (U) A CORPORATE HOLDING COMPANY 100 PERCENT OWNED BY THE </p><p>ITALIAN FINANCE MINISTRY, FERROVIE DELLO STATO WAS PART OF </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT UNTIL 1992 WHEN, AS MANDATED BY </p><p>EUROPEAN UNION (EU) DIRECTIVES (REF. A), IT BECAME A SEPARATE </p><p>STATE-OWNED HOLDING COMPANY.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH SIMILAR EU </p><p>DIRECTIVES CALLING FOR THE SEPARATION OF THE BUDGETS OF </p><p>RAILROAD INFRASTRUCTURES AND RAILROAD SERVICES, FS IN 2000 </p><p>CREATED TWO MAJOR HOLDINGS WITH SEPARATE MANAGEMENT AND </p><p>BUDGETS: TRENITALIA (THE PREDOMINANT ITALIAN RAILWAY SERVICE </p><p>COMPANY) AND RETE FERROVIARIA ITALIANA (RFI), THE NATIONAL </p><p>RAILWAY INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDER.  FURTHER FS HOLDINGS INCLUDE </p><p>GRANDI STAZIONI (THE HANDLING COMPANY OF 12 MAJOR TRAIN </p><p>STATIONS, MEDIE STAZIONI (THE HANDLING COMPANY OF 1,000 </p><p>ITALIAN MINOR STATIONS), AND TAV (ITALY\'S HIGH SPEED RAIL </p><p>COMPANY).  FERROVIE DELLO STATO REMAINS A MAJORITY </p><p>STAKEHOLDER IN MOST OF THESE HOLDINGS, AND A SIZABLE MINORITY </p><p>STAKEHOLDER IN THE OTHERS. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02912  01 OF 04  141435Z </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) SINCE THE FINANCE MINISTRY IS THE SOLE SHAREHOLDER OF </p><p>FS, THE ITALIAN INTERMINISTERIAL COMMITTEE FOR POLITICAL </p><p>ECONOMY (CIPE) EXERCISES CONTROL OVER ITS MAJOR ECONOMIC </p><p>TRANSACTIONS.  THE TRANSPORT MINISTRY CREATES POLICIES </p><p>RELATED TO SAFETY, QUALITY OF SERVICE, INFRASTRUCTURE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, AND COMMERCIAL COMPETITION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) VINCENZO SOPRANO, DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FOR </p><p>FS, PROVIDED US WITH A SNAPSHOT OF FERROVIE DELLO STATO, AND </p><p>SOME STATISTICS ON ITS TWO MAJOR HOLDINGS.  THROUGH </p><p>TRENITALIA AND RFI, FS OWNS AND OPERATES OVER 16,000 </p><p>KILOMETERS OF NATIONAL RAILWAY LINES, 4,500 LOCOMOTIVES, MORE </p><p>THAN 10,000 PASSENGER CARS AND 50,000 FREIGHT CARS, 2,500 </p><p>STATIONS, 570 CARGO AREAS, AND 367 ELECTRICAL STATIONS AND </p><p>SUBSTATIONS.  IT HAS APPROXIMATELY 110,000 EMPLOYEES, DOWN </p><p>FROM 160,000 A FEW YEARS AGO (MOSTLY THROUGH ATTRITION).  FS </p><p>EARNED APPROXIMATELY 6.9 BILLION EUROS IN REVENUES IN 2001, </p><p>AND HAD 4.7 BILLION EUROS IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  IT </p><p>TRANSPORTS APPROXIMATELY 90 MILLION TONS OF CARGO EACH YEAR </p><p>ON NEARLY 1,200 FREIGHT TRAINS PER DAY. </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE: TURNING THE CORNER? </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2633 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02912  02 OF 04  141436Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   MFA-00   AF-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    ITC-01   L-00     AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SA-00    EPAE-00  DSCC-00  G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------BD3F31  141437Z /38 </p><p>R 141500Z JUN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 4222 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 ROME 002912 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ELTN, KCIP, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN RAILWAY LIBERALIZATION AND SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) BOTH SOPRANO AND MARIA COSTA OF FS ARE OPTIMISTIC </p><p>ABOUT THE STATE-OWNED COMPANY\'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  FS </p><p>REGISTERED A MINUSCULE BUT SYMBOLIC PROFIT IN 2001 OF 20 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02912  02 OF 04  141436Z </p><p>MILLION EUROS -- ITS FIRST PROFIT EVER, UP FROM A LOSS OF 683 </p><p>MILLION EUROS IN 2000 AND 1.45 BILLION EUROS IN 1999. </p><p>SOPRANO AND COSTA ATTRIBUTE MUCH OF THIS SUCCESS TO THE </p><p>"PRIVATE-SECTOR CULTURE" IN TRENITALIA (WHICH MANAGES LONG </p><p>DISTANCE, REGIONAL, AND METROPOLITAN PASSENGER AND FREIGHT </p><p>SERVICES), NOTING THAT IT AND RFI MUST NOW OPERATE WITH THEIR </p><p>OWN BUDGET, RESOURCES, AND ABILITIES.  ACCORDING TO INTERNAL </p><p>FS STATISTICS, CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND CORPORATE IMAGE HAVE </p><p>IMPROVED AS WELL AS THE COMPANY\'S SAFETY RECORD.  SOPRANO </p><p>STATED THAT FS\' .28 ACCIDENTS PER MILLION KILOMETERS TRAVELED </p><p>(THE LOWEST IN A DOWNWARD TREND DATING FROM 1996) IS WELL </p><p>BELOW THE EUROPEAN BENCHMARK OF .6 - .7 ACCIDENTS </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) FS AIMS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE BY ENHANCING THE </p><p>CAPACITY, SPEED AND RELIABILITY OF ITS SERVICES, FOCUSING ON </p><p>PASSENGER (AS OPPOSED TO FREIGHT) TRAFFIC.  A KEY PART OF </p><p>THIS STRATEGY IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITALY\'S HIGH-SPEED RAIL </p><p>NETWORK THROUGH ONE OF ITS HOLDINGS, TAV (A PUBLIC-PRIVATE </p><p>PARTNERSHIP COMPANY FORTY PERCENT OWNED BY FS).  THE </p><p>HIGH-PEED RAIL NETWORK WILL BE CONCENTRATED AROUND ITAL\'S </p><p>FASTEST GROWING CITIES OF ROME, NAPLES, TURIN BOLOGNA, </p><p>FLORENCE, GENOA, AND VENICE.  WHILE THS DUAL GAUGE TRACK </p><p>SYSTEM IS DESIGNED FOR PASSENGR SERVICE, FS HOPES THAT THIS </p><p>"VERTICAL BACKBONE (EVENTUALLY PLANNED TO INCLUDE 1,300 </p><p>KILOMETERSOF TRACK) MAY ONE DAY TRANSPORT FREIGHT TRAFFIC AS </p><p>WELL.  (NOTE: BY SOME ESTIMATES, ITALIAN INTERNAIONAL </p><p>RAILWAY FREIGHT IS EXPECTED TO GROW BY SEVETY-FIVE PERCENT </p><p>BY 2005.  END NOTE). </p><p>8. (U) TA\'S INCREASING PORTION OF FS\' CAPITAL EXPENDITURES </p><p>(APPROXIMATELY 2 BILLION OF 4.7 BILLION EUROS IN 001) </p><p>INDICATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HIGH-SPEED AIL PROJECT IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02912  02 OF 04  141436Z </p><p>FS\' BUSINESS PLAN.  WHILE ONLY THE FLORENCE - ROME LINK IS </p><p>YET OPERATIONAL, THE RAILWAY COMPANY EXPECTS TO COMPLETE THE </p><p>HIGH-SPED LINK FROM ROME TO NAPLES IN 2004, TURIN TO MILA </p><p>IN 2005, FLORENCE TO BOLOGNA TO MILAN IN 2007, ND GENOA TO </p><p>VENICE IN 2010.  GRUPPO FERROVIARIO BEDA IS MANUFACTURING </p><p>THE FLEET OF SIXTY, 13-CAR,NON-TILTING TRAINS FOR USE ON THE </p><p>NETWORK. </p><p> </p><p>STATE OF PLAY: MARKET LIBERALIZATION </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>9. (U) THROUGH THE CREATION OF TRENITALIA AND RFI, ITALY HAS </p><p>TAKEN A BIG STEP IN FORWARD IN PUTTING ITS RAILWAY SECTOR ON </p><p>A MARKET BASED STANDARD.  NONETHELESS, THERE IS STILL A LONG </p><p>WAY TO GO.  IN SEPTEMBER 2001, A FREIGHT TRAIN OWNED BY </p><p>FERROVIE NORD WAS THE FIRST, NON-FS TRAIN TO TRAVEL ON THE </p><p>ITALIAN RAIL NETWORK.   TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE RAILWAY SERVICE </p><p>IN ITALY, AN INTERESTED COMPANY MUST FIRST ACQUIRE A LICENSE </p><p>FROM THE MOT AND A CERTIFICATE OF SAFETY AND SECURITY FROM </p><p>RFI.  WHILE APPROXIMATELY TEN COMPANIES (ALL CARGO PROVIDERS) </p><p>HAVE ACQUIRED THE REQUIRED LICENSE, ONLY FERROVIE NORD HAS </p><p>ACQUIRED BOTH THE NECESSARY  LICENSE AND SECURITY </p><p>CERTIFICATE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) REGARDING ANY FUTURE PRIVATIZATION, MOT DIRECTOR </p><p>GENERAL ENZO CELLI (AND OTHERS) EXPLAINED THAT THE GOI WOULD </p><p>NOT BE ABLE TO SELL ITS STAKE IN FS, OR ANY PART THEREOF, FOR </p><p>A PROFIT UNLESS FS COULD FIRST BE MADE MORE COMPETITIVE.  HE </p><p>STATED THAT IT WOULD BE YEARS BEFORE THE RAILWAY SECTOR IS </p><p>READY FOR PRIVATIZATION AND THAT THE SECTOR WOULD </p><p>REQUIRE HEAVY INVESTMENT IN THE MEANTIME TO BE MADE MORE </p><p>ATTRACTIVE TO BUYERS.  THIS INVESTMENT, HE EXPLAINED, IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02912  02 OF 04  141436Z </p><p>BEING MADE THROUGH THE HIGH-SPEED RAIL PROJECT (AMONG </p><p>OTHERS).  WITH AN EYE TOWARD A FUTURE MORE LIBERALIZED </p><p>MARKET, FS\' SOPRANO TOLD US THAT HIS STRATEGY IS TO INCREASE </p><p>SHAREHOLDER VALUE BY INCREASING THE RAILWAY NETWORK\'S </p><p>CAPACITY, IMPROVING EFFICIENCY IN RAILWAY OPERATIONS, AND </p><p>IMPROVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.  HE CONCURRED WITH CELLI, </p><p>THAT INCREASED LIBERALIZATION (AND EVEN PRIVATIZATION) WILL </p><p>BE IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT FIRST TAKING THESE STEPS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) CELLI AND SOPRANO BOTH NOTED THAT WHILE THE GOI MAY </p><p>EVENTUALLY SELL SOME OR ALL OF ITS SHARE IN TRENITALIA, THEY </p><p>WOULD LIKELY KEEP RFI STATE-OWNED.  THE PROVISION AND </p><p>MAINTENANCE OF RAILWAY INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT A PROFIT MAKING </p><p>ENTERPRISE THAT CAN EASILY ATTRACT PRIVATE INTERESTS, AND THE </p><p>STATE DOES NOT WANT TO SEE A DETERIORATION OF SERVICES </p><p>COMPARABLE TO THE BRITISH. </p><p> </p><p>MARKET OPENINGS FOR U.S. COMPANIES </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>12. (U) GIOVANNI SATTA OF FEDERTRANSPORTO, THE CONFEDERATION </p><p>OF ITALIAN TRANSPORT COMPANIES, BELIEVES THERE ARE MARKET </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES FOR U.S. FIRMS IN IT AND RAIL-TRAFFIC CONTROL </p><p>SYSTEMS.  HE STATED, AND SOPRANO OF FS CONCURRED, THAT FS </p><p>INTENDS TO IMPROVE SERVICES THROUGH THE MODERNIZATION OF ITS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2636 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02912  03 OF 04  141436Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   MFA-00   AF-00    AID-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOTE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00 </p><p>      EXIM-01  OIGO-00  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   MED-07   AC-01    NEA-00   DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    IRM-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  SA-00    EPAE-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  G-00     SAS-00     /015W </p><p>                  ------------------BD3F47  141438Z /38 </p><p>R 141500Z JUN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 4223 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>DEPT OF COMMERCE WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 ROME 002912 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/05/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ELTN, KCIP, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN RAILWAY LIBERALIZATION AND SECURITY </p><p> </p><p>ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) CAPABILITIES. </p><p>LIKEWISE, AS THE RAILWAY SECTOR LIBERALIZATION PROCESS </p><p>CONTINUES, U.S. FIRMS COULD PROVIDE SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02912  03 OF 04  141436Z </p><p>SERVICES TO NEW ENTRANTS IN THE ITALIAN RAILWAY MARKET.

A). </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY CONCERNS AND MEASURES </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>13. (C) ECONOFF MET WITH FS SECURITY MANAGER DAMIANO TOSELLI </p><p>AND, ALONG WITH POST\'S TSA SECURITY LIAISON OFFICER (CASLO) </p><p>KARL BROWN, WITH FRANCO FIUMARA, DIRECTOR OF SECURITY OF RFI, </p><p>TO DISCUSS ITALIAN RAILWAY SECURITY POST-9/11. (FIUMARA WAS </p><p>ALSO A SPEAKER AT THE EMBASSY-SPONSORED CRITICAL </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION CONFERENCE, SEE REF B.).  TOSELLI </p><p>CHARACTERIZED THE ITALIAN RAILWAY NETWORK (INCLUDING THE </p><p>THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS OF RAILWAY, TRAINS, TUNNELS, </p><p>STATIONS, PARKING FACILITIES, AND ASSOCIATED RESTAURANTS AND </p><p>SHOPS) AS HIGH-RISK INFRASTRUCTURE, SINCE IT CONSTITUTES AN </p><p>"OPEN" SYSTEM TO WHICH THE PUBLIC HAS ALMOST UNRESTRICTED </p><p>ACCESS.  HE EXPLAINED FS\' FOUR-PART PLAN TO PROTECT THE </p><p>RAILWAY SYSTEM FROM ATTACK: INTELLIGENCE INTEGRATION, </p><p>TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION, PROCEDURAL REVIEW, AND PERSONNEL </p><p>TRAINING.  THIS PLAN, HE EXPLAINED, IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH </p><p>THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT UNITS INVOLVED: </p><p>THE RAILWAY POLICE (PART OF THE NATIONAL POLICE FORCE), THE </p><p>RAILWAY COMPANY\'S PRIVATE SECURITY FORCE, VARIOUS MUNICIPAL </p><p>POLICE FORCES, AND THE ITALIAN MILITARY. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) TOSELLI EXPLAINED IN DETAIL THE ACTIONS TAKEN IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TO HEIGHTEN </p><p>SECURITY ON THE RAILWAY NETWORK.  THE NATIONAL RAILWAY POLICE </p><p>NOW CONDUCT INCREASED ONBOARD PASSENGER CHECKS, INCREASED </p><p>RAILWAY TRACK CONTROL WITH THE USE OF GROUND PERSONNEL AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02912  03 OF 04  141436Z </p><p>HELICOPTERS, AND INCREASED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE CHECKS WITH </p><p>CANINE ASSETS.  ITALIAN MILITARY FORCES SET UP INCREASED </p><p>GUARD SERVICES AND PATROLS AT SELECT BRIDGES AND TUNNELS AS </p><p>WELL AS AT KEY FACILITIES SUCH AS STATIONS AND MAINTENANCE </p><p>FACILITIES. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) THE ITALIAN RAILWAY CORPORATE SECURITY FORCE ALSO </p><p>TOOK ACTION, INCLUDING: </p><p>- PERFORMING A RISK EVALUATION, IN COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY FORCES, OF THE RAILWAY NETWORK\'S FIXED ASSETS </p><p>(STATIONS, TUNNELS, AND BRIDGES), </p><p>- CLOSING THE SELF-SERVICE LUGGAGE DROP-OFF PROGRAM (NOW </p><p>MONITORED BY THE POLICE), </p><p>- UPDATING THE EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS OF BOTH STATIONS AND </p><p>RAILWAY OFFICES, </p><p>- INCREASING PRIVATE SECURITY GUARD AND PATROL SERVICES AT </p><p>STATIONS, ROLLING STOCK YARDS, AND CHEMICAL AND HAZARDOUS </p><p>MATERIAL YARDS, </p><p>- ENHANCING SECURITY MEASURES IN POSTAL SERVICE AREAS (X-RAY </p><p>CONTROL AND THE USE OF MASKS FOR EMPLOYEES), </p><p>- CONDUCTING COMMUNICATION AWARENESS SEMINARS FOR RAILWAY </p><p>SECURITY STAFF, </p><p>- SECURING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS IN THE RAILWAY </p><p>COMPANIES DATA ELABORATION CENTER AND TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER </p><p>AND </p><p>- INCREASING RAILWAY STAFF TRAINING THROUGH SECURITY </p><p>AWARENESS SEMINARS AND EVACUATION DRILLS. </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) FIUMARA SPOKE SPECIFICALLY OF THE DIFFICULTY OF </p><p>PROVIDING SECURITY FOR ITALY\'S ENTIRE NATIONAL RAILWAY </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OVER 16,000 KILOMETERS OF TRACK AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02912  03 OF 04  141436Z </p><p>ALL RAILWAY STATIONS.  HE AND POST\'S CASLO SAID THAT THEY </p><p>WOULD CONSIDER INFORMATION AND PERSONNEL EXCHANGES IN THE </p><p>FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) BOTH TOSELLI AND FIUMARA EXPECT INCREASED </p><p>PARTICIPATION AND INTEREST IN THE OCTOBER 2002 MEETING, TO BE </p><p>HELD IN ROME, OF COLPOFER (COLLABORATION OF RAILWAY POLICE </p><p>AND SECURITY SERVICES), THE TWENTY-NINE MEMBER ORGANIZATION </p><p>OF EUROPEAN RAILWAY COMPANY SECURITY OFFICIALS AND RAILWAY </p><p>POLICE FORCES DEDICATED TO INCREASED COOPERATION ON RAILWAY </p><p>SECURITY ISSUES.  THEY SAID THAT THE EVENTS OF 9/11 HAVE </p><p>REVITALIZED WHAT WAS AT ONE POINT A LARGELY INACTIVE GROUP. </p><p>TOSELLI, THE CHAIRMAN OF COLPOFER, AND FIUMARA, THE SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL, WILL HOST THE UPCOMING MEETING AND INVITED EMBOFFS </p><p>TO ATTEND AS OBSERVERS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>18.
