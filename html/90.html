<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 ALEXANDRIA 00817 </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE PASS USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  ALEXANDRIA:  A "DEEPLY DIVIDED" CITY </p><p> </p><p>REFS:  (A)  ALEXANDRIA 435 </p><p>-      (B)  ALEXANDRIA 535 </p><p>-      (C)  ALEXANDRIA 771 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY. THE JULY 2 PRESENTATION, TO THE PEOPLES </p><p>ASSEMBLY, OF THE PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORT </p><p>ON ALEXANDRIA GOVERNOR FAWZI MA\'AZ\'S CONDUCT OF OFFICE </p><p>DID NOT STOP THE DEBATE.  INDEED, NEW CHARGES AND </p><p>COUNTER-CHARGES HAVE EMERGED DURING THE SUMMER </p><p>WHICH INDICATE THAT THIS ISSUE IS FAR FROM DEAD. </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO HIS TROUBLES, THE GOVERNOR HAD </p><p>REMOVED TWO OF ALEXANDRIA\'S TOP POLITICAL OFFICIALS, </p><p>LEAVING THE CITY WITH AN EMBATTLED GOVERNOR AND TWO </p><p>NEWCOMERS TO COPE WITH ALEXANDRIA\'S MOUNTING PROBLEMS. </p><p>HE HAS ALSO SUED WAFD PARTY AND NEWSPAPER LEADERSHIP </p><p>FOR LIBEL.  WHILE THERE AREN\'T TOO MANY HEROES IN THIS </p><p>STORY, THE EMERGING POLITICAL ROLE OF MINISTER OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE, YOUSSEF WALLY, IS WORTH NOTING.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p>- </p><p>- </p><p>3.  POLITICS, THIS SUMMER, IN THE VERY POLITICAL </p><p>CITY OF ALEXANDRIA, HAVE REVOLVED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY </p><p>AROUND THE PROBLEMS OF   GOVERNOR FAWZI MA\'AZ </p><p>(REFS A AND B).  WHILE THE GOE APPARENTLY ELECTED </p><p>TO CUBBY-HOLE THE REPORT PRODUCED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE (REF A), THIS WAS NOT ACHIEVED </p><p>WITHOUT A SOMEWHAT TUMULTUOUS LAST DAY OF PARLIAMENT-- </p><p>AND AT LEAST SOME DAMAGE, WE HEAR, TO THE REPUTATION </p><p>OF PEOPLES ASSEMBLY SPEAKER, RIFAAT AL MAHGOUB. </p><p>ALTHOUGH NO PUBLISHED ACCOUNT TELLS US WHAT HAPPENED </p><p>TO THE REPORT (SOME BELIEVE IT WAS REFERRED TO THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT; OTHERS THINK THE REPORT, </p><p>AND ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS, WENT TO THE </p><p>SOCIALIST PROSECUTOR), THE GOVERNMENT IS PERCEIVED </p><p>AS HAVING TAKEN NO ACTION IN THE MA\'AZ CASE, AND </p><p>ATTACKS IN THE WEEKLY "WAFD" HAVE CONTINUED UNABATED. </p><p>THE GOVERNOR HAS ENMESHED HIMSELF FURTHER BY GIVING </p><p>INTERVIEWS WHICH, FAR FROM EXONERATING HIM, HAVE NOT </p><p>ONLY KEPT THE DEBATE ALIVE, BUT PROVIDED NEW </p><p>AMMUNITION FOR CHARGES AND COUNTER-CHARGES. </p><p> </p><p>-- NEAR THE END OF THE SUMMER, AND BECAUSE OF PERCEIVED </p><p>WRONG ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE </p><p>SEWAGE DEBATE HAS RESURFACED, BOTH IN ALEXANDRIA AND </p><p>IN THE COLUMNS OF ALL NATIONAL DAILIES.  THIS PROUD </p><p>CITY IS NOT ONLY BEING HELD UP TO NATIONAL RIDICULE, </p><p>BUT THE APPARENT DRIFT AND INDECISIVENESS--ON BOTH THE </p><p>MA\'AZ CASE AND THE SEWAGE OUTFALL QUESTION--HAVE LEFT </p><p>BOTH OBSERVERS AND PARTICIPANTS WITH THE IMPRESSION </p><p>OF "A WEAK GOVERNMENT"--IN THE WORDS OF ONE OF MA\'AZ\'S </p><p>FELLOW GOVERNORS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE LAST DAY OF PARLIAMENT:  BY ALL ACCOUNT, THE </p><p>LAST DAY OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, JULY 2, WAS A LIVELY </p><p>OR "MELODRAMATIC" (IN THE WORDS OF "AL SHAAB" JULY 9) </p><p>OCCASION.  THE 41-PAGE REPORT ON GOVERNOR MA\'AZ </p><p>WAS DISTRIBUTED TO MEMBERS ONLY THAT MORNING.  TWO </p><p>NDP AND TWO WAFD MEMBERS WERE ALLOWED BRIEFLY TO DISCUSS </p><p>THE SANITIZED (ACCORDING TO THE "WAFD," JULY 18) REPORT. </p><p>THE LAST SESSION OF PARLIAMENT, HEAVILY MANAGED </p><p>BY SPEAKER RIFAAT AL MAGHOUB, LASTED ONLY TWO HOURS </p><p>AND 20 MINUTES AND SAW THE PASSAGE OF 6 NEW LAWS </p><p>AND THE APPROVAL OF 14 REPORTS.  THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL </p><p>ITEM WAS NOT EVEN ON THE AGENDA:  AT THE REQUEST GOVERNOR </p><p>MA\'AZ, THE NDP MOVED TO LIFT THE PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>IMMUNITY OF "WAFD" EDITOR, AND PA MEMBER FOR PORT SAID, </p><p>MOUSTAPHA SHERDY.  IN ALEXANDRIA, WE UNDERSTAND </p><p>THAT GOVERNOR MA\'AZ HOSTED AN INFORMAL RECEPTION </p><p>IN HIS OFFICE THAT DAY TO CELEBRATE THE EVENTS </p><p>THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN CAIRO.  COMMENT:  ANOTHER </p><p>LOCAL ECHO OF CAIRO\'S DRAMATIC EVENTS WAS THAT </p><p>MA\'AZ SENT HIS SECRETARY TO THE CONSULATE GENERAL </p><p>THAT DAY TO PROCURE A VISA FOR HIS SON:  "HE PROBABLY </p><p>IS ASKING FOR THIS NOW, BECAUSE HE WON\'T BE AROUND </p><p>MUCH LONGER," COMMENTED HIS SECRETARY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  LIFTING SHERDY\'S PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY:  BY </p><p>MOST ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING NDP, THE SUCCESSFUL ACTION </p><p>TO LIFT SHERDY\'S IMMUNITY (PROPOSED BY MA\'AZ DEFENDER </p><p>FAROUK  GARANA, SEE PARA 7), WAS EXTRA-PARLIAMENTARY. </p><p>IT PROVOKED A WAFD BOYCOTT OF PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S </p><p>TRADITIONAL TEA ON THE LAST DAY OF PARLIAMENT, A </p><p>ONE DAY RESIGNATION FROM THE WAFD LEADERSHIP BY </p><p>FOUAD SERAG EL DIN, AND A FIRESTORM IN NATIONAL </p><p>PRESS, MOST NOTABLY IN THE "WAFD," WHICH INTER ALIA, </p><p>CHALLENGED THE GOE TO SHOW ON TELEVISION THE </p><p>COMPLETE FOOTAGE OF THE LAST DAY OF THE PEOPLES </p><p>ASSEMBLY (A CHALLENGE NOT YET TAKEN UP).  AN </p><p>UNREPENTANT SHERDY HELD FORTH IN A PAGE ONE EDITORIAL </p><p>IN THE JULY 11 EDITION OF THE "WAFD," DECRYING </p><p>MAGHOUB\'S  MANAGEMENT OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY AND </p><p>ATTACKING THE SPEAKER IN STRONG LANGUAGE:  "THE DOG </p><p>AT THE CENTER OF POWER... KNOWS HE IS NOTHING BUT </p><p>A MERE CORPSE SITTING IN THE (SPEAKER\'S) CHAIR... WHOSE </p><p>PEN DISCHARGES NOTHING BUT PUS.  I WOULD LIKE TO TELL </p><p>HIM THAT MY FEELING TOWARDS HIM NOW IS THE FEELING OF </p><p>PITY."  THE SAME EDITORIAL ALSO (AND FINALLY) GOT TO </p><p>THE HEART OF WAFD CHARGES AGAINST MA\'AZ:  "MA\'AZ SHOULD </p><p>NOT SLIP AWAY FROM PUNISHMENT (BUT) MA\'AZ IS NOT </p><p>THE ONLY PROBLEM.  THE BIG PROBLEM IS THE PROBLEM OF </p><p>CORRUPTION IN EGYPT.  THE \'WAFD\' BELIEVES DEEPLY </p><p>THAT THE CAMPAIGN WE ARE STARTING IN ALEXANDRIA </p><p>SHOULD TEACH THE REST (OF THE COUNTRY) A GOOD LESSON." </p><p>COUNTER-ATTACKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT, MOUSSA SABRY </p><p>(AL AKHBAR, JULY 14)WROTE A PAEAN OF PRAISE FOR </p><p>MA\'AZ, REMINDED HIS READERS THAT SHERDY LIVED </p><p>"IN THE GULF COUNTRIES FOR 12 YEARS," AND ACCUSED </p><p>SHERDY OF THINKING THAT "THE PEN IS A CLEAVER IN THE </p><p>HAND OF A BUTCHER."  SABRY\'S EDITORIAL WAS ENTITLED </p><p>"CHAOS."  MA\'AZ AND ALEXANDRIA\'S LOCAL POPULAR </p><p>COUNCIL PRESIDENT, EZZAT KADDOUS (REF A) SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>BROUGHT LIBEL SUITS AGAINST WAFD PARTY LEADER </p><p>FOUAD SERAG EL DIN, AND THREE "WAFD" NEWSPAPER </p><p>STAFFERS, SHERDY, BADAWI AND THE NEWSPAPER\'S </p><p>CARTOONIST.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE.FIRST SITTING </p><p>OF THE TRIAL WILL BE IN THE GIZA DISTRICT COURT </p><p>OCTOBER 8.  BECAUSE SOME HARSH FEELINGS, REGARDING </p><p>THE JULY 2 SESSION OF THE PA, REMAIN, MOST </p><p>OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT THE GOE WILL WANT TO COMPLETE </p><p>(OR OTHERWISE GET PAST) THIS LIBEL CASE BEFORE </p><p>PARLIAMENT RECONVENES IN NOVEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MA\'AZ, "ATTEMPTING TO SAVE HIMSELF":  MA\'AZ </p><p>SPENT THE REMAINDER OF THE MONTH OF JULY GIVING </p><p>INTERVIEWS IN GOE-SPONSORED DAILIES AND MASS- </p><p>CIRCULATION MAGAZINES ATTEMPTING TO EXCULPATE </p><p>HIMSELF FROM THE CORRUPTION CHARGES:  THE THRUST </p><p>OF THE ATTACKS AGAINST HIM HAD MOVED FROM POOR </p><p>MANAGEMENT CHOICES REGARDING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS </p><p>(REF A) TO PROFITEERING ON LAND DEALS.  AFTER </p><p>THREE TIMES, IN THE COURSE OF THESE INTERVIEWS, </p><p>ATTEMPTING TO SHIFT BLAME TO A FORMER GOVERNOR </p><p>FOR PROFITEERING ON BEDOUIN LAND IN THE BEACH </p><p>RESORT AREA OF AGAMI, THE SON OF KAMAL EL DIB </p><p>(GOVERNOR OF ALEXANDRIA UNDER NASSER AND SADAT) </p><p>STRUCK BACK.  THE GOE-SPONSORED PRESS DECLINED </p><p>TO PUBLISH HIS STATEMENT, BUT ON AUGUST 28, THE </p><p>"WAFD" CARRIED A BANNER HEADLINE STORY, WHICH </p><p>INCLUDED A PHOTOCOPY OF A DEED SIGNED BY MA\'AZ. </p><p>COMMENT:  MOUFID EL DIB, THE SON OF THE FORMER </p><p>GOVERNOR, TOLD US THAT HE IGNORED THE FIRST MA\'AZ </p><p>CHARGE, BUT AS THE GOVERNOR EMBELLISHED THE STORY </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE S, HE FELT THAT HIS DECEASED </p><p>FATHER\'S HONOR, INDEED THAT OF THE WHOLE FAMILY, </p><p>WAS AT STAKE.  HE ALSO TOLD US THAT THE GOE OFFICIAL </p><p>IN CHARGE OF "STATE" (BEDOUIN) LAND IN AGAMI </p><p>(THROUGH WHO MA\'AZ CONDUCTED HIS LAND DEALS) WAS </p><p>RECENTLY REMOVED FROM HIS POST.  TO GIVE AN IDEA </p><p>OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROFITEERING, EL DIB </p><p>REPORTED THAT MA\'AZ (WHILE STILL A POLICE OFFICER) </p><p>HAD PAID THE STATE 173 PIASTERS PER SQUARE METER </p><p>FOR THE LAND, BUT THAT EL DIB--NOT HIS FATHER-- </p><p>HAD BOUGHT IT FROM MA\'AZ AT LE 200 PER SQUARE </p><p>METER.  END COMMENT.  WHILE SPEAKING PUBLICLY </p><p>ABOUT THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM, MA\'AZ MOVED QUIETLY </p><p>BEHIND THE SCENES TO RID HIMSELF OF TWO OF </p><p>ALEXANDRIA\'S POLITICAL BARONS--MEN WHOM HE </p><p>BELIEVED, ACCORDING TO OUR CONTACTS, HAD NOT </p><p>SUPPORTED HIM SUFFICIENTLY IN HIS TIME OF NEED. </p><p>IN SO DOING, HE HAS REMOVED FROM THE LOCAL SCENE </p><p>TWO OF THE MOST DYNAMIC, WELL-KNOWN NATIONALLY, </p><p>AND (BY MOST ACCOUNTS) EFFECTIVE, POLITICAL </p><p>LEADERS IN ALEXANDRIA:  ALEXANDRIA$S SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL (NUMBER TWO PERSON IN THE GOVERNORATE </p><p>AFTER MA\'AZ HIMSELF), SHAKER ABDEL SALAAM, AND </p><p>LOCAL NDP PARTY HEAD, MOHAMED ABDELLAH. </p><p> </p><p>7.  NDP PARTY LEADERSHIP:  A SMALL PAGE ONE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT, IN "AL AHRAM" AUGUST 12, INFORMED </p><p>READERS THAT MAHMOUD DAOUD, HEAD OF EGYPT\'S </p><p>COTTON BOARD AND MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE UNDER </p><p>SADAT, HAD REPLACED MOHAMED ABDELLAH AS NDP </p><p>PARTY CHIEF IN ALEXANDRIA.  WHILE THE BUSY ABDELLAH, </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE PA FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, </p><p>AND PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION LEADER FOR ALEXANDRIA, </p><p>HAD FOUR TIMES ATTEMPTED TO SUBMIT HIS RESIGNATION </p><p>FROM THE ALEX PARTY POST, HE WAS ACTUALLY FIRED </p><p>BY SOBHI ABDEL HAKIM, SHURA COUNCIL SPEAKER AND </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE NDP.  AT (WE ARE TOLD) </p><p>MA\'AZ\'S INSTIGATION, A TEN-PERSON DELEGATION </p><p>COMPRISED OF PA AND SHURA COUNCIL MEMBERS FROM </p><p>ALEXANDRIA, AND LED BY PA MEMBER (AND MA\'AZ ALLY) </p><p>FAROUK GARANA, SOUGHT A MEETING WITH SOBHI TO </p><p>COMPLAIN ABOUT ABDELLAH\'S NUMEROUS ABSENCES FROM </p><p>ALEXANDRIA, AND PARTY DRIFT HERE.  MUCH OF THE </p><p>SESSION HARKED BACK TO THE TUMULTUOUS MEETING AT </p><p>NDP ALEX HEADQUARTERS IN APRIL (REF A).  ABDELLAH, </p><p>IN TRUE ALEXANDRIAN FAS MANAGED TO HAVE </p><p>SEVERAL SUPPORTERS INCLUDED IN THE DELEGATION--WHO </p><p>SOUGHT TO EXPLAIN THE STEPS ABDELLAH HAD TAKEN SINCE </p><p>THAT TIME TO HEAL PARTY WOUNDS, AND MA\'AZ\'S </p><p>REFUSAL TO COOPERATE WITH ABDELLAH.  THE FACT OF </p><p>ABDELLAH\'S FREQUENT ABSENCES FROM ALEXANDRIA, </p><p>HOWEVER, COULD NOT BE DISPUTED, AS HE HAD JUST </p><p>RETURNED FROM PA TRIPS TO BOTH THE PRC AND THE </p><p>USSR (REF C).  ABDELLAH MAINTAINS HE WAS CONSULTED </p><p>ON HIS OWN OUSTER AND WAS GIVEN THE COURTESY OF </p><p>A PRIORI VETOES ON THREE POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS </p><p>(NOTABLY, GARANA).  MOST ACCOUNTS HOLD THAT IT </p><p>WAS ACTUALLY YOUSSEF WALLY, GOE MINISTER OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL OF </p><p>THE NDP, WHO SUGGESTED DAOUD AS THE NEW PARTY </p><p>LEADER FOR ALEXANDRIA--NOT ABDELLAH, AS ABDELLAH </p><p>NOW TRIES TO CLAIM.  ACCORDING TO DAOUD, HIS </p><p>COURTESY CALL ON NDP CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT MUBARAK, </p><p>REVOLVED LESS AROUND ALEXANDRIA\'S MOUNTING PROBLEMS, </p><p>THAN AROUND MUBARAK\'S HORTATORY (AND SOMEWHAT </p><p>MISPLACED, GIVEN THE MOODS IN ALEXANDRIA) COMMENTS </p><p>TO DAOUD TO BREATHE LIFE BACK INTO THE PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR IN ALEXANDRIA.  AT DINNER THE WEEK OF </p><p>HIS SELECTION, THE SOMEWHAT ELDERLY DAOUD </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS HE FACES </p><p>HERE, AND SAID HIS FIRST PRIORITY MUST BE TO HEAL </p><p>THE WOUNDS IN THIS "DEEPLY DIVIDED CITY." </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE SECRETARY GENERALSHIP:  THE FORMER </p><p>CLOSENESS OF FAWZI MA\'AZ AND SHAKER ABDEL SALAAM </p><p>(BOTH POLICE GENERALS) CANNOT BE EXAGGERATED. </p><p>THEY APPEARED EVERYWHERE TOGETHER AND ALL THE </p><p>CITY\'S PROBLEMS WERE ADDRESSED, IN A FASHION, BY </p><p>MA\'AZ NAMING SHAKER TO HEAD A"STUDY COMMITTEE." </p><p>SHAKER EVEN GAINED NATIONAL PROMINENCE AS HEAD </p><p>OF THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE FOR USAID\'S SUCCESSFUL </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD URBAN SERVICES (NUS) PROJECT IN THE </p><p>THREE URBAN GOVERNORATES OF CAIRO, GIZA AND </p><p>ALEXANDRIA.  SHAKER\'S DOOR AT THE GOVERNORATE </p><p>WAS ALWAYS OPEN TO CALLERS, WHEREAS THE ALOOF </p><p>MA\'AZ HOLDS ONLY TST PERFUNCTORY (AND </p><p>GENERALLY NON-SUBSTANTIVE) COURTESY SESSIONS </p><p>WITH VISITORS.  WE HAD EARLIER SPECULATED ON (WHAT </p><p>WAS VIEWED LOCALLY AS) THE NEAR MIRACLE THAT </p><p>SHAKER\'S NAME WAS NEVER ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF </p><p>MA\'AZ IN THE NUMEROUS "WAFD" ARTICLES, ALTHOUGH </p><p>SHAKER WAS PERCEIVED LOCALLY AS HEAVILY INVOLVED </p><p>IN PRIVATE BUSINESS DEALS, WHEREAS MA\'AZ (UNTIL </p><p>RECENTLY) WAS NOT.  WE ALSO RECEIVED INFORMATION </p><p>FROM VARIOUS ALEXANDRIANS THAT SHAKER WAS QUIETLY </p><p>BETRAYING THE GOVERNOR, IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE </p><p>HIMSELF; THESE SAME SOURCES REPORTED THAT THEY </p><p>HAD TOLD THE GOVERNOR THE SAME THING.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE ACTUAL CAUSE FOR SHAKER\'S SUDDEN TRANSFER TO </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN CAIRO REMAINS </p><p>UNKNOWN, IT IS CLEAR THAT HE WAS PUT OUT TO </p><p>PASTURE BY MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AND </p><p>ANOTHER FORMER POLICE GENERAL) ABU BASHA--AT THE </p><p>REQUEST OF MA\'AZ.  ALLEGEDLY FURIOUS AT HIS </p><p>TRANSFER TO THE NON-POSITION OF "SPECIAL ASSISTANT </p><p>TO THE MINISTER," SHAKER REPORTEDLY HAS RESIGNED </p><p>FROM THE GOVERNMENT.  COMMENT:  MA\'AZ APPEARS DETERMINED </p><p>TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES IN THE MIDST OF THIS </p><p>TURMOIL:  IN A MEETING WITH VISITING USG </p><p>OFFICIALS AUGUST 21, MA\'AZ POINTEDLY TOLD US </p><p>THAT SHAKER HAD RECEIVED A "BIG PROMOTION." </p><p>THE SAME DAY, THE GOVERNOR LED THE DELEGATION </p><p>TO THE FUNERAL IN ALEXANDRIA OF SHAKER\'S MOTHER. </p><p>END COMMENT.  ACCORDING TO ABDELLAH, A DISHEARTENED, </p><p>AND INCREASINGLY ISOLATED, MA\'AZ TOLD THE MINISTER </p><p>TO "NAME ANYONE" TO REPLACE SHAKER--A HIGHLY </p><p>UNUSUAL POSITION FOR ANY SENIOR MANAGER REGARDING </p><p>THE SELECTION OF HIS DEPUTY.  BUT, THAT IS WHAT </p><p>THE MINISTER DID:  FAYEZ OSMAN, FORMER HEAD OF THE </p><p>EASTERN ALEXANDRIA DISTRICT, IS ALEXANDRIA\'S </p><p>NEW SECRETARY GENERAL.  A FORMER ARMY OFFICER </p><p>WHO LOST HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE 1956 WAR, THE </p><p>CONGENIAL AND LOW-KEY OSMAN IS DUE FOR RETIREMENT </p><p>IN A YEAR OR SO.  THIS LEAVES THIS TROUBLED CITY </p><p>WITH AN EMBATTLED AND ISOLATED GOVERNOR, A </p><p>CARETAKER SECRETARY-GENERAL--AND A POLITICALLY </p><p>AWARE LOCAL POPULATION DRAWING UNFORTUNATE CONCLUSIONS </p><p>ABOUT ITS CENTRAL NMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9.  "MASSIVE" POLICE TRANSFERS:  WHILE EVERYONE </p><p>LOCALLY ASSOCIATES THE EARLY AUGUST TRANSFER OUT </p><p>OF ALEXANDRIA OF 132  POLICE OFFICERS ("THE </p><p>LARGEST SHAKEUP IN POLICE ANNALS" ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE "WAFD," AUGUST 22, AND CONFIRMED BY LOCAL </p><p>SOURCES) WITH THE GOVERNOR\'S PROBLEMS, WE HAVE </p><p>BEEN UNABLE TO ESTABLISH ANY DIRECT LINK--OTHER </p><p>THAN THE OBVIOUS ONE THAT, AS A RESPECTED FORMER </p><p>POLICE GENERAL, MA\'AZ MUST HAVE BEEN CONSULTED. </p><p>HOWEVER, RUMORS ALSO ABOUND THAT HIS CLOSEST </p><p>ALLIES IN THE POLICE FORCE WERE AMONG THOSE </p><p>TRANSFERRED.  A GOVERNOR OF ANOTHER DELTA </p><p>GOVERNORATE HAS EVEN MADE THE PRIVATE SUGGESTION </p><p>THAT THE ACTIVIST MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR, AHMED </p><p>ROUCHDY, WAS PREPARED TO TAKE ACTION ON "THE </p><p>MESS IN ALEXANDRIA," EVEN IF THE MINISTER OF LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT, ABU BASHA, WAS (OR COULD) NOT.  A </p><p>FINAL TWIST TO THE SPECULATION IS THAT THE MOI </p><p>WAS UNHAPPY WITH HOW THE SECURITY FORCES IN </p><p>ALEXANDRIA WERE COPING WITH THE FUNDAMENTALISTS\' </p><p>CHALLENGE HERE (SEE ALEX 546 AND 587).  COMMENT: </p><p>WE EARLIER REPORTED ON THE REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE IN </p><p>BEHAVIOR OF BOTH THE FUNDAMENTALISTS AND THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES AT THE RECENT KURBAN BAIRAM, AS </p><p>COMPARED TO THE RAMADAN BAIRAM (ALEX  799). </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>10.  HOW MUCH LONGER WILL MA\'AZ REMAIN?  WHILE </p><p>THERE ARE SOME LOCAL NOTABLES WHO CONTINUE TO </p><p>DEFEND MA\'AZ (USUALLY HARKING BACK TO HIS </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED EXCELLENCE AS A POLICE GENERAL), </p><p>THERE IS A GENERALIZED LOCAL SENTIMENT THAT HE </p><p>MUST GO:  HE HAS BEEN TOO DEBASED BY THE MONTHS- </p><p>LONG CAMPAIGN IN THE "WAFD" (ON WHICH THE GOE </p><p>HAS BEEN PUBLICLY SILENT) AND PERCEIVED INACTION </p><p>ON THE CITY\'S MOUNTING PROBLEMS (LED BY GARBAGE </p><p>AND SEWAGE QUESTIONS), TO BE ABLE TO LEAD THIS </p><p>RATHER RAMBUNCTIOUS CITY.  PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S </p><p>POSITION ON THE MA\'AZ TROUBLES REMAINS SOMEWHAT </p><p>OPAQUE:  WHILE WE HAVE HAD REPORTS (REF B) THAT </p><p>HE INTENDS TO LET THE GO TO TRIAL, HIS </p><p>REMARKS EARLIER THIS SUMMER TO THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>TENDED TO INDICATE THAT HE CONTINUES TO HAVE </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN MA\'AZ.  SINCE THAT TIME, HOWEVER, </p><p>NEW CHARGES HAVE EMERGED (SUCH AS IN PARA 6), PLUS-- </p><p>AND IMPORTANTLY-- THE PRESIDENT HAS SPENT THE </p><p>SUMMER IN ALEXANDRIA.  WHILE HE HAS NOT BEEN </p><p>SEEN SOCIALLY, MRS. MUBARAK HAS BEEN VISIBLE AT </p><p>(AND KNOWN TO HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT) THE CITY\'S </p><p>BEACHES, AND IN AGAMI.  AT THIS POINT, DECENCY </p><p>WOULD SEEM TO REQUIRE THAT MA\'AZ BE PERMITTED HIS </p><p>DAY IN COURT (PARA 4), BUT WE SUSPECT THAT HE WILL </p><p>BE REMOVED BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, PROBABLY </p><p>IN A CAMOUFLAGED TRANSFER OF SEVERAL GOVERNORS. </p><p>IF HE IS NOT, THE GOE, AND SPECIFICALLY PRESIDENT </p><p>MUBARAK, WILL FACE INCREASING CHARGES OF NEGLIGENCE </p><p>OF EGYPT\'S SECOND CITY, AND LOUDER COMPLAINTS THAN </p><p>WHAT WE ARE ALREADY HEARING THAT MA\'AZ IS BEING </p><p>PROTECTED BECAUSE HE IS FROM MENOUFIA (REF A), </p><p>AND HAS FAMILY TIES TO MUBARAK\'S PRIVATE SECRETARY, </p><p>ZAKI. </p><p> </p><p>11.  A FEW (INTERIM) CONCLUSIONS: </p><p> </p><p>-- WHILE TEMPERS ARE RISING HERE, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>REGARD TO THE SEWAGE ISSUE, THE GOE HAS PROBABLY </p><p>DISCOUNTED SOME OF THE GRIPES AS THEY COME FROM </p><p>A CITY WHICH TRADITIONALLY IS ON DIFFICULT TERMS </p><p>WITH THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  NEVERTHELESS, THE </p><p>IMPRESSION OF WEAKNESS, OR NEGLIGENCE, OF THE </p><p>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT REMAINS.  AND, ALEXANDRIA\'S </p><p>PROBLEMS--FOLLOWING THE ANNUAL SUMMER SOJOURN </p><p>HERE OF THE POLITICAL AND JOURNALISTIC LEADERSHIP </p><p>OF CAIRO--CAN NO LONGER BE CALLED "LOCAL." </p><p>INDEED, ALEXANDRIA AND ITS PROBLEMS, HAVE BEEN </p><p>REPEATEDLY FEATURED IN THE COLUMNS THIS SUMMER </p><p>OF ALL THE NATIONAL DAILIES AND HAVE APPEARED, AS </p><p>WELL WE UNDERSTAND, IN THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ARABIC LANGUAGE MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE POLITICAL CHANGES WHICH HAVE OCCURRED </p><p>HERE (PARAS 7-8), PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF THE </p><p>GOVERNOR\'S PROBLEMS, HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE: </p><p>APPARENT WEAK MEN HAVE REPLACED STRONG, NATIONAL </p><p>FIGURES.  WHILE DAOUD HAS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE </p><p>LEADER OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY, HE HAD A MIXED </p><p>REPUTATION AS MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE.  LOCALLY, </p><p>HE IS KNS INTELLIGENT, BUT A HEAVY DRINKER, </p><p>AND SOMEONE POOR ENOUGH (UNLIKE ABDELLAH) TO BE </p><p>TEMPTED BY PATRONAGE HE WILL NOW CONTROL. </p><p>THE NEW SECRETARY GENERAL WILL LIKELY BE NON-CORRUPT, </p><p>BUT NOT DYNAMIC ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THE CITY\'S </p><p>MOUNTING PROBLEMS, WHILE MA\'AZ CONCENTRATES ON </p><p>HIS LEGAL DEFENSES. </p><p> </p><p>-- AS IS ITS WONT, THIS CITY HAS ALSO HAD AN </p><p>IMPACT ON THE REPUTATION OF SEVERAL NATIONAL </p><p>LEADERS.  DUE NOT ONLY TO HIS MANAGEMENT OF THE </p><p>PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, BUT TO HIS PERSISTENT REPUTATION </p><p>LOCALLY AS A NASSERIST, RIFAAT AL MAGHOUB IS </p><p>VIEWED IN ALEXANDRIA AS ALMOST OUT OF THE RUNNING </p><p>TO REPLACE KAMAL HASSAN ALI AS PRIME MINISTER. </p><p>ON THE OTHER HAND, YOUSSEF WALLY, WHOSE ROLE </p><p>IN KING-MAKING IS KNOWN (IN ADDITION TO SELECTING </p><p>ABDELLAH\'S REPLACEMENT, WALLY IS ALLEGED PERSONALLY </p><p>TO HAVE PICKED THE NEW GOVERNOR OF DAMIETTA, AS </p><p>WELL AS SEVERAL OF THE MINISTERS IN MUBARAK\'S </p><p>CURRENT CABINET) AND HE IS NOW VIEWED LOCALLY AS </p><p>THE FRONT RUNNER AMONG THOSE LIKELY TO BECOME PM. </p><p>ADDITIONALLY, WALLY IS GENUINELY POPULAR IN THE </p><p>AGRICULTURAL DELTA.  FINALLY, AS HEAD OF GOVERNMENT, </p><p>THE OTHERWISE POPULAR KAMAL HASSAN ALI, HAS NOT </p><p>EARNED ANY KUDOS HERE THIS SUMMER--EITHER FOR HIS </p><p>LACK OF ACTION ON THE MA\'AZ CASE, OR FOR HIS MIS- </p><p>HANDLING OF THE CITY\'S SEWAGE PROBLEMS.  THAT TOPIC </p><p>WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF A SEPTEL ABOUT THE TROUBLED </p><p>SUMMER IN THIS CITY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COOK </p><p></p></div>
