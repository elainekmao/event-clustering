<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000458 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/IFD/OMA AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: IMF KRUEGER AND WORLD BANK LINN DELIVER TOUGH </p><p>MESSAGE ON ECONOMIC REFORM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary:  IMF Deputy Managing Director Krueger </p><p>delivered a tough message to Prime Minister Gul and the rest </p><p>of the GOT January 16, stressing that the government needed </p><p>to implement the economic reform program in light of its </p><p>"dangerous" financial situation.  She and World Bank VP Linn, </p><p>who told Ambassador January 17 that he would deliver an </p><p>equally tough message, warned the Turks that any third  party </p><p>assistance (i.e., from the U.S.) would only offset the impact </p><p>of an Iraq operation, and could not substitute for sound </p><p>policy.  Gul and others told Krueger that, while there had </p><p>been some problems, they were now focused on the need to </p><p>implement the program, and would be meeting January 18 to </p><p>consider additional fiscal measures to meet the 6.5 percent </p><p>primary surplus target.  However, proposed GOT amendments to </p><p>the Public Procurement Law and the GOT\'s "tax amnesty" remain </p><p>serious problems in the eyes of the Fund and Bank.    Fund </p><p>staff will review the situation again next week, based on the </p><p>expected new fiscal measures and hoped-for draft LOI. </p><p>Meanwhile, Embassy will continue to push the reform message </p><p>with GOT officials and parliamentarians (septel).  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Krueger Delivers Tough Message </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) IMF Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger started </p><p>with two meetings in Istanbul January 15: with TUSIAD </p><p>(Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen\'s Association) </p><p>Chairman Ozilhan, and Banks Association President Ozince. </p><p>Krueger\'s main point in those meetings - that any extra </p><p>financing that Turkey may receive in the event of an Iraq </p><p>operation is no substitute for good economic policy - was not </p><p>conveyed accurately to the Turkish press.  Ozilhan told the </p><p>press that the IMF was contemplating additional financing. </p><p>The IMF promptly issued press statements both in Ankara and </p><p>Washington denying that she said this.  (Comment: In </p><p>meantime, the Ozilhan statement temporarily buoyed local </p><p>financial markets.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In Ankara, Krueger met both senior government civil </p><p>servants  (Treasury Undersecretary Oztrak, Banking Board </p><p>Chairman Akcakoca, Central Bank Governor Serdengecti), and AK </p><p>Cabinet members (PM Gul, Deputy PM Sener, State Minister </p><p>Babacan, Finance Minister Unakitan).  IMF resrep said her </p><p>message on sticking with reforms got increasingly tough </p><p>throughout the day, and was especially tough by the time she </p><p>met with PM Gul in the evening, which was one of the most </p><p>substantive meetings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Krueger told Gul the IMF is concerned with the lack </p><p>of focus on economic policy, and that the financial situation </p><p>was "dangerous" given the GOT\'s precarious cash position. </p><p>This is no time to be complacent on reforms, she continued, </p><p>and financing from other sources (referring to potential U.S. </p><p>assistance in the event of Iraq) would help address </p><p>Iraq-related losses but would be no substitute for good </p><p>policy.  She said several issues need to be resolved before </p><p>the IMF can be completed,  mentioning the fiscal measures to </p><p>reach a 6.5 percent of GNP primary surplus, agreement on the </p><p>Pamuk and Yapi Kredi Banks, and implementation of the Public </p><p>Procurement Law. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Gul replied, per Resrep, that he had a lot of </p><p>issues, including Iraq, but he is now focused on economic </p><p>policy.  The Higher Planning Council (Note: a subset of the </p><p>full Cabinet) will meet on January 18 to consider a new set </p><p>of fiscal saving measures.  Gul said he is talking with the </p><p>Chairman of the Supreme Administrative Court (Danistay) to </p><p>get early court resolution of the Pamuk Bank case (though we </p><p>understand Danistay will not be able to hear the case </p><p>quickly).   Gul was less clear on the Public Procurement Law, </p><p>noting only that the law was in effect as of January 1, as </p><p>scheduled.  (Comment: The problem is that the law is not </p><p>being implemented, and AK has proposed legislative amendments </p><p>now in parliamentary committee to limit the law.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In response to Gul\'s question on what was needed to </p><p>bring the IMF Mission back to Turkey, Krueger did not give a </p><p>detailed response, per IMF resrep ("her role is not to </p><p>negotiate," he said, "but they know our concerns.")  But the </p><p>brief IMF press statement released after her meetings on </p><p>January 16 concluded with the sentence:  "As soon as the </p><p>government has clarified its concrete policy plans further, </p><p>we stand ready to send an IMF mission to Ankara to discuss </p><p>the 2003 budget another issues key to the program."  This </p><p>sentence was the local press lead on January 17 (and we </p><p>understand caused some concern among both Turkish officials </p><p>and emerging market bond traders in London). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Krueger\'s other interlocutors "read from the same </p><p>script" and kept to generalities.   Deputy PM Sener </p><p>highlighted the strong privatization program announced </p><p>January 15. (IMF is checking whether the TEKEL privatization </p><p>plan has been adopted by the High Privatization Council, </p><p>which would meet a Fourth Review prior action.)  Asked about </p><p>the "Tax Peace" or amnesty law passed by parliament January </p><p>17, resrep noted that the version as passed contained some </p><p>amendments proposed by IMF staff.  For instance, the cut-off </p><p>date for tax arrearages subject to the amnesty was pushed </p><p>back to 2001 (the original draft included arrearages </p><p>accumulated as recently as October 2002, right before the </p><p>elections.)  However, any tax amnesty needs to include </p><p>measures to strengthen tax administration, in order to send a </p><p>credible signal of resolve on tax collection. The IMF staff </p><p>would have to verify that the right amendments were included; </p><p>if so, the law would not be a "show stopper" for the Fourth </p><p>Review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Looking forward, Krueger will meet with AK Chairman </p><p>Erdogan in Davos to reiterate her tough message.  Following </p><p>the January 18 Higher Planning Council meeting, at which </p><p>fiscal measures are expected to be adopted, the IMF may send </p><p>out a team of technical fiscal experts to work with the GOT </p><p>on the budget.  The full 2003 budget is scheduled to be </p><p>submitted to the Higher Planning Council on January 28, and </p><p>be passed by parliament on February 5, before the Muslim </p><p>holiday.  Resrep believes the full IMF Mission may well be </p><p>delayed until after the February 11-14 holiday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>World Bank\'s Linn Equally Tough </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) In a breakfast meeting with the Ambassador January </p><p>17, World Bank Vice President Johannes Linn said he planned </p><p>to deliver a similarly tough message in his meetings, </p><p>including with PM Gul.  For the World Bank, adoption of the </p><p>Public Procurement Law amendments is a show stopper (i.e., it </p><p>would result in suspending some $900 million in public sector </p><p>adjustment loans scheduled for 2003). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Linn was pessimistic about the GOT\'s fiscal </p><p>sustainability, saying that even a 6.5 percent of GNP primary </p><p>surplus may not be sufficient for 2003.  Like the IMF\'s </p><p>Krueger, he planned to deliver a tough message on the </p><p>"Turkish perception of moral hazard in the potential U.S. </p><p>assistance package."  The Ambassador assured Linn that the </p><p>U.S. has many times told the GOT of the economic reform </p><p>conditionality in any potential U.S. assistance.  The Prime </p><p>Minister and others know that is our position. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Linn said the Bank will remind the Turks of World </p><p>Bank anti-poverty programs, which are an AK priority.  First, </p><p>the World Bank assists the GOT\'s Social Solidarity Fund, </p><p>which provides winter fuel, school supplies, and food to the </p><p>poorest segment of Turkish society (in 2002, this was only </p><p>funded at TL 875 trillion - about $500 million).  Second, the </p><p>Bank is supporting the Direct Income Support program for </p><p>farmers, currently funded at about 1 percent of GNP.  The </p><p>Bank says Turkish Treasury deliberately delays these </p><p>payments, in order to harness resources for other payment </p><p>needs, and the World Bank wants to improve delivery of this </p><p>key antipoverty measure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Linn concluded that World Bank assistance on this </p><p>and other GOT priorities is endangered by the Public </p><p>Procurement Law amendments, fiscal spending measures and </p><p>other concerns. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
