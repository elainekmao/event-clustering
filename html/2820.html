(C) Summary: Ruling party militants continue their </p><p>campaign of violent retribution against opposition </p><p>supporters, six weeks after Zimbabwe\'s presidential election </p><p>ended.  Since March 11, at least 18 people have died in </p><p>political violence, bringing the total for the year to at </p><p>least 54.  The number of internally displaced persons has </p><p>soared in the last month; at least 100,000 MDC sympathizers </p><p>have been made homeless since early March, according to local </p><p>NGOs.  Reports of systematic sexual abuse by ZANU-PF </p><p>militants against women are coming to light; one local NGO is </p><p>preparing legal action against ZANU-PF on this issue.  On the </p><p>commercial farms, the forcible eviction of farmers and </p><p>hundreds of their workers is accelerating.  In some areas, </p><p>the evictions are being conducted en masse, often with the </p><p>help of the police, to make way for military and GOZ </p><p>officials who were promised rewards for backing Mugabe.  The </p><p>eviction of commercial farmers has spread and is now a </p><p>nationwide phenomenon.  Property and legal rights are </p><p>essentially a thing of the past for Zimbabwe\'s white </p><p>minority, and basic human rights for the majority are </p><p>increasingly disregarded.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Political Violence Continues Unabated </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Six weeks after Zimbabwe\'s presidential election </p><p>ended on March 11, ruling party youth, militants, and war </p><p>veterans continue their campaign of violent retribution </p><p>against opposition supporters.  According to the Zimbabwe </p><p>Human Rights NGO Forum, an umbrella group of local human </p><p>rights groups, 54 people have died in political violence </p><p>since the beginning of this year; by our count, 18 of these </p><p>were killed after the election.  (Note:  Three additional </p><p>deaths not mentioned in the Forum\'s report have been reported </p><p>to us by other sources, which indicates that the actual death </p><p>toll could be higher.  End note.)  The Forum\'s April 15 </p><p>report showed that 35 of those killed were MDC supporters, </p><p>seven were ZANU-PF, two were war veterans, and ten were of </p><p>unknown political affiliation.  At least five of those killed </p><p>were MDC polling agents, including Petros Jeka, who was </p><p>stabbed to death by suspected ZANU-PF supporters near </p><p>Masvingo on April 4.  The April 23 edition of the independent </p><p>"Daily News" reported that ZANU-PF youth killed a 55th </p><p>victim, Brandina Tadyanemhandu, in her home on April 21 by </p><p>cutting her head off with an ax in front of her two young </p><p>daughters.  A Zimbabwe Republic Police spokesperson termed </p><p>the report a "grandiose lie." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Since January 1, the Forum\'s member organizations </p><p>have received reports of 945 cases of political beatings or </p><p>torture, 229 cases of intimidation or threats, 214 </p><p>kidnappings, 143 unlawful detentions, 29 disappearances, and </p><p>5 politically-motivated rapes. (Note: The number of rapes is </p><p>likely much higher due to the social stigma against reporting </p><p>rape. End note.)  The Zimbabwe Women Lawyers\' Association </p><p>(ZWLA) stated in an April 18 "Financial Gazette" article that </p><p>it is gathering evidence of systematic sexual abuse of women </p><p>at the hands of ZANU-PF supporters for a legal case against </p><p>the ruling party.  ZWLA stated that scores of women have been </p><p>raped in ZANU-PF militia camps around the country because of </p><p>their support for the MDC.  Frances Lovemore of the Amani </p><p>Trust human rights NGO told poloff that the problem is not </p><p>necessarily increasing, but is only being reported more now </p><p>with the ZWLA\'s involvement.  Many of the internally </p><p>displaced women who come to Amani do not report cases of </p><p>sexual abuse, many because they are afraid of being divorced. </p><p> Lovemore noted that farm workers are more frequently asking </p><p>NGOs for condoms, perhaps because they fear having relations </p><p>with a wife who has been attacked. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Number of Internal Refugees Skyrockets </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Speaking more generally of internally displaced </p><p>Zimbabweans, Lovemore told poloff April 22 that the problem </p><p>continues to spiral.  Just since the election, 53,000 have </p><p>been displaced in Mashonaland West province alone, and 69,000 </p><p>have been displaced from communal lands nationwide.  Another </p><p>10-12,000 are homeless in urban areas, and thousands of </p><p>commercial farm workers have been displaced, most in the </p><p>Mashonaland provinces, Lovemore stated.  She could not </p><p>estimate the total, but the figures she gave us put the total </p><p>number of internally displaced persons well above 100,000. </p><p>More continue to stream into Harare every day, Lovemore </p><p>reported; Amani Trust just set up another camp for 400 </p><p>commercial farm workers from Marondera on April 22.  Lovemore </p><p>informed poloff that local NGOs, partially with USAID </p><p>funding, are organizing a nationwide network of camps to </p><p>handle the increasing masses of displaced people.  As another </p><p>example of displacement, in an April 19 press release, the </p><p>MDC stated that 12 of its supporters in Makoni North were </p><p>assaulted and evicted from their homes earlier in the week; </p><p>their huts were burned down in the presence of the police, </p><p>who made no arrests. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Philip Muskwe, director of the non-partisan Uzumba </p><p>Development Trust (UDT) NGO, told poloff April 23 that </p><p>ZANU-PF militants have made at least 600 people homeless in </p><p>Uzumba-Maramba-Pfungwe (UMP) district (Mashonaland East) </p><p>alone.  Twelve homes belonging to MDC supporters, including </p><p>three polling agents, were recently burned down.  UDT is </p><p>cooperating with Amani and Tim Neill,s Zimbabwe Community </p><p>Development Trust to establish up to five refugee camps in </p><p>UMP district for up to 1,500 people, Muskwe stated.  Although </p><p>there are not many commercial farms in UMP, many resettled </p><p>farmers there are leaving their plots for the Macheke area </p><p>(75 km to the south), where many commercial farmers have been </p><p>expelled.  This is creating tension with the Macheke farm </p><p>occupiers, who complain that they are first in line for </p><p>Macheke property and the UMP settlers are "queue jumpers." </p><p>This merely reflects the chaotic and unorganized nature of </p><p>the farm seizures, Muskwe opined.  Political violence </p><p>continues unabated in UMP, Muskwe added; an MDC activist, </p><p>George Kamudzanga, was so severely beaten in an attack last </p><p>week that he is now permanently wheelchair-bound.  Many MDC </p><p>supporters, mostly youth living with their parents, are </p><p>attacked in the middle of the night and told never to return </p><p>to UMP. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Commercial Farmers Evicted En Masse </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The situation on the commercial farms continues to </p><p>deteriorate.  Over the last several weeks, war veterans and </p><p>ZANU-PF militia, often with the aid of the police, have </p><p>become more aggressive in forcibly evicting commercial </p><p>farmers and farm workers from their homes.  Many farm workers </p><p>have been beaten in the process.  The farmers are usually </p><p>given only a few hours to leave and take what personal </p><p>belongings they can.  They are not permitted to remove any </p><p>farm equipment, including tractors, trucks, generators, </p><p>irrigation works, or fertilizer (see REF A).  Usually the </p><p>farmhouses are ransacked and looted, sometimes before the </p><p>farmers can leave, and any harvested crops, tractors and </p><p>trucks are stolen.  The farm workers, homes are often burned </p><p>down.  The Marondera area (about 60 km southeast of Harare) </p><p>has been particularly hard-hit, where nearly every farm (some </p><p>30 in all) has been invaded and pillaged, regardless of </p><p>whether the farm was ever listed for acquisition or the </p><p>farmer served with a Section 8 eviction notice.  For every </p><p>farm attacked, 300-600 people have been displaced, according </p><p>to Mary Wood, a farmer in the area.  The evictions appear to </p><p>be spreading; we have received reports that farms or ranches </p><p>in Mazoe (35 km north of Harare), Gokwe (Midlands province), </p><p>Muzurabani (Mashonaland Central), Gwanda and Beitbridge </p><p>(Matabeleland South) have been similarly attacked.  In most </p><p>cases, the invasions appear to take place in the presence of </p><p>police details and at the behest of a local police commander, </p><p>government official, or military officer, who have been </p><p>promised plots or entire farms.  When farmers plead with the </p><p>police to intervene, they are usually told that it is a </p><p>political matter or a land issue and they should contact the </p><p>local district administrator or the Lands Committee in </p><p>Harare.  Some have done this, but to no avail. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Below is a compendium of some of the more egregious </p><p>commercial farm reports we have received in the last week: </p><p> </p><p>-- Ian and Kerry Kay, commercial farmers and MDC activists, </p><p>were forced off their farm on March 15 (REF C).  They have </p><p>been living in Harare ever since.  With the help of their </p><p>lawyers, they recently re-served the court order (initially </p><p>issued last year) requiring the farm occupiers to leave on </p><p>the provincial governor, provincial administrator, district </p><p>administrator and police.  All refused to receive it.  The </p><p>district administrator simply threw it back at them without </p><p>reading it.  When Ian attempted to return to the farm last </p><p>week, he found two army details present; they would not allow </p><p>him to enter the property.  He found out later that all of </p><p>his harvested tobacco and paprika and 250 head of cattle have </p><p>been stolen.  All his workers are now encamped in Harare. </p><p>The farm has essentially ceased to operate. </p><p> </p><p>-- On March 20, 15-20 occupiers locked themselves in the home </p><p>of Marondera farmer Mike Colahan, who summoned the police. </p><p>When they arrived, they were accompanied by Gerry Gatora, the </p><p>ZANU-PF provincial legal advisor, who orchestrated a </p><p>"kangaroo court" for Colahan.  Gatora accused Colahan of </p><p>making pangas (machetes) and petrol bombs on his property for </p><p>the MDC, but could produce no credible evidence.  On April </p><p>19, 25-30 militia members showed up, forced Colahan,s </p><p>workers out of their homes, and told Colahan he had two hours </p><p>to pack and leave.  When he returned later, he found his </p><p>house ransacked, his workers, houses looted and his tractors </p><p>and farm trucks missing.  His property has never been listed </p><p>for compulsory acquisition, he told poloff. </p><p> </p><p>-- Guy Cartwright told embassy officers that on April 6, </p><p>retired brigadier general Ambrose Mutinhuri showed up at his </p><p>Waltondale farm near Marondera with two police details and a </p><p>crowd of drunken, violent youth.  The youth threw most of his </p><p>personal belongings out of the house, and smashed or looted </p><p>what was left.  Twenty of his workers were "severely </p><p>assaulted."  The police escorted him back onto the property </p><p>days later to find his tractors and trucks gone; the police </p><p>told him he could not remove his tobacco crop, which is now </p><p>in curing sheds. </p><p> </p><p>-- Angry war veterans, accompanied by embarrassed GOZ </p><p>agricultural extension officials, arrived on the Tamba ranch </p><p>in Gwanda district for the first time on April 20 by smashing </p><p>the gate lock, John Darlow told poloff.  The war vets told </p><p>Darlow he should leave immediately as his property was being </p><p>pegged for resettlement.  Darlow had received a Section 8 </p><p>eviction notice on January 7 and has been fighting local </p><p>officials over it in the courts.  Darlow reported that War </p><p>Veterans Association Secretary for Projects Andrew Ndlovu </p><p>arrived in the area two weeks ago and has been instigating </p><p>actions against farm and ranch owners.  Three ranchers in the </p><p>area have already been forced off their property.  According </p><p>to Darlow, Shannon Wheeler,s large orange orchard in </p><p>Beitbridge district, was recently invaded, and Wheeler has </p><p>not been allowed to leave his house.  Occupiers there are </p><p>chopping down the orange trees and confiscating the oranges. </p><p> </p><p>-- Mack Gloss, another Matabeleland South rancher, told </p><p>poloff that on April 19, governor Stephen Nkomo stirred up </p><p>trouble by making stops along the main road in the district </p><p>and telling youth and war vets to begin taking over the </p><p>white-owned ranches.  Nkomo also warned the police not to </p><p>interfere.  Gloss stated that at least 20 farms and ranches </p><p>in Gwanda and Beitbridge districts have been affected. </p><p>Poaching has increased markedly--at least 100 animals a day </p><p>are being slaughtered for sale to local abattoirs; even two </p><p>giraffes were recently killed by poachers, Gloss reported. </p><p>All of this is being sanctioned by local GOZ officials, who </p><p>are doling out plots to themselves, policemen and local </p><p>ZANU-PF-affiliated businessmen.  Even Mr. Moyo, the dean of </p><p>Bulawayo Polytechnic Institute has been awarded a ranch. </p><p>ZANU-PF MP and Deputy Foreign Minister Abedinico Ncube has </p><p>already moved onto a neighbor\'s ranch after forcibly </p><p>expelling the rancher, Gloss stated. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) It is clear that Mugabe has no intention of cutting </p><p>back on political violence until he has eliminated his </p><p>political foes as a viable source of opposition.  Following </p><p>this script, there appears to be no end in sight to the </p><p>significant human rights violations that occur daily in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  Victims have increasingly little recourse as the </p><p>police more frequently turn a blind eye or dismiss acts of </p><p>criminality as "political matters."  On the land issue, a </p><p>massive new land grab is currently underway, and this grab </p><p>appears to be more a political reward for well-connected </p><p>ZANU-PF supporters than a real attempt to resettle communal </p><p>farmers or landless peasants.  Everyone from senior </p><p>government ministers to local government officials to </p><p>military officers are reaping the windfall of Mugabe\'s </p><p>tainted electoral win, sometimes at the expense of farm </p><p>occupiers who have been in place for two years.  Property and </p><p>legal rights are essentially a thing of the past for </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s white minority, and basic human rights for the </p><p>majority are increasingly disregarded as a tiny elite </p><p>tightens its repressive grip on the country.  End comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
