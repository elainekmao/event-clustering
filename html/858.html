<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ALGIERS 003262 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  11/20/2006 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, PINS, KISL, AG </p><p>SUBJECT:  RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS:  BLOODIER, BUT </p><p>          NOT INDICATIVE OF NEW TERRORIST STRENGTH </p><p> </p><p>REF:  ALGIERS 2884 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES JOSEPH </p><p>STAFFORD, AMEMBASSY ALGIERS, REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF NEARLY </p><p>FIVE YEARS OF SUSTAINED VIOLENCE HERE, NOVEMBER 1996 </p><p>HAS WITNESSED SOME PARTICULRLY GRUESOME TERRORIST </p><p>ATROCITIES, ESPECIALLY INCENTRAL ALGERIA.  RATHER </p><p>THAN TRYING TO PREVENT EWSPAPERS FROM PUBLISHING </p><p>STORIES ABOUT THE ATROITIES, THE GOVERNMENT APPEARS </p><p>TO BE ENCOURAGING HEM TO DO SO.  THESE LATEST </p><p>ATTACKS HAVE AGGRAVATD PUBLIC WORRIES ABOUT THE </p><p>SECURITY SITUATION, EPECIALLY IN THE MOUNTAINOUS </p><p>REGIONS OUTSIDE ALGIRS.  WE SENSE, HOWEVER, LITTLE </p><p>CHANGE IN CITIZEN\' DAILY ROUTINE IN ALGIERS OR EVEN </p><p>THE NEARBY BLDA REGION, SCENE OF SEVERAL OF THE </p><p>RECENT INCIDENS.  THIS LATEST UPTURN IN VIOLENCE </p><p>HAS NOT YET PROVIDED CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF NEW </p><p>CAPABILITIES ON THE PART OF EXTREMIST ELEMENTS, NOR </p><p>OF A GREATER THREAT TO REGIME STABILITY.  AT THIS </p><p>POINT, WE SEE NO/NO REASON TO REVISE OUR ASSESSMENT </p><p>THAT THE GOA IS MAKING PROGRESS IN REDUCING THE </p><p>INSURGENCY THREAT -- BUT LESS PROGRESS IN REDUCING </p><p>TERRORISM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  TERRORIST INCIDENTS AGAINST CIVILIANS </p><p>REMAIN FREQUENT IN ALGERIA, BUT NOVEMBER 1996 </p><p>APPEARS TO BE A PARTICULARLY HORRIFIC MONTH. </p><p>MURDERS OF CIVILIANS APPEAR TO HAVE INCREASED FROM </p><p>THE LEVELS EARLIER IN THE AUTUMN.  THE LIST OF </p><p>RECENT ATTACKS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE NOVEMBER 5 MASSACRE OF 13 CIVILIANS IN </p><p>DAOUDA, IN TIPAZA WILAYA; </p><p> </p><p>-- THE NOVEMBER 7 BOMBING IN A VILLAGE NEAR TLEMCEN, </p><p>IN WESTERN ALGERIA, WHICH KILLED FIVE, INCLUDING THE </p><p>VILLAGE MAYOR; </p><p> </p><p>--  THE NOVEMBER 8 SLAUGHTER OF 31 PERSONS IN SIDI </p><p>EL KEBIR VILLAGE, OUTSIDE OF BLIDA; </p><p> </p><p>--  THE NOVEMBER 10 BOMBING IN BIR KHADEM, OUTSIDE </p><p>OF ALGIERS, WHICH KILLED SEVEN (INCLUDING THE SISTER </p><p>OF AN EMBASSY FSN EMPLOYEE); </p><p> </p><p>--  THE NOVEMBER 12 ATTACK WHICH KILLED 14 PERSONS </p><p>NEAR OUED ALLEUG, IN BLIDA WILAYA; </p><p> </p><p>--  THE NOVEMBER 13 KILLINGS OF 29 PERSONS IN TWO </p><p>INCIDENTS IN MEDEA WILAYA; </p><p> </p><p>--  THE NOVEMBER 15 MURDER OF A BULGARIAN CITIZEN IN </p><p>ALGIERS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  FROM WHAT LITTLE WE CAN PICK EJFROM OUR </p><p>CONTACTS, THE RECENT SPATE OF INCIDENTS HAS </p><p>AGGRAVATED THE WORRIES OF MANY, ESPECIALLY IN THE </p><p>MOUNTAINS OUTSIDE OF ALGIERS, ABOUT SECURITY.  IN </p><p>SOME CASES, THESE INCIDENTS STIRRED VILLAGES TO </p><p>HASTEN CREATION OF LOCAL MILITIAS.  FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MASSACRE AT SIDI EL KEBIR, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT DISTRIBUTED ARMS TO VILLAGERS WHO </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY KILLED TWO ALLEGED TERRORISTS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS.  AN ALGERIAN WHO LIVES </p><p>IN A VILLAGE NEAR THE JUNCTIONS OF BLIDA, TIPAZA AND </p><p>ALGIERS WILAYAS TOLD POLOFF NOVEMBER 12 THAT MANY IN </p><p>HIS COMMUNITY FEAR AN ATTACK BY ARMED ISLAMISTS; HE </p><p>PREDICTED IT WAS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME.  IN </p><p>RESPONSE, THE VILLAGE HAS ASKED THE LOCAL MILITARY </p><p>AUTHORITIES FOR ARMS WITH WHICH TO ESTABLISH A </p><p>"SELF-PROTECTION" FORCE (SO FAR, AUTHORITIES HAVE </p><p>DECLINED TO SUPPLY WEAPONS). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  IN SOME CASES FAMILIES HAVE TAKEN FLIGHT. </p><p>A JOURNALIST WITH THE AVOWEDLY ANTI-ISLAMIST </p><p>NEWSPAPER LIBERTE TOLD US THAT ONE OF THEIR </p><p>REPORTERS SAW IN BLIDA ON NOVEMBER 18 HUNDREDS OF </p><p>PERSONS WHO HAD FLED THEIR HOMES IN REMOTE MOUNTAIN </p><p>LOCALES OUTSIDE OF THE CITY AND TAKEN REFUGE IN </p><p>DOWNTOWN BLIDA (ITSELF NOT THE SAFEST PLACE).  THE </p><p>REPORTER SAID THAT SEVERAL OF THESE PEOPLE TOLD HIM </p><p>THE ARMED GROUPS OPERATING IN THE MOUNTAINS HAVE </p><p>VOWED TO COMMIT MORE MASSACRES.  (ACCORDING TO PRESS </p><p>REPORTS, THE BAND WHICH COMMITED THE NOVEMBER 12 </p><p>MURDERS AT OUED ALLEUG LEFT A NOTE SIGNED BY THE </p><p>ARMED ISLAMIC GROUP (GIA) AND CONCLUDING WITH THE </p><p>EXPRESSION, "BLOOD, BLOOD, DESTRUCTION, </p><p>DESTRUCTION.") </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  THE GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED ITS MEDIA POLICY </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO THESE TERRORIST INCIDENTS.  (IT HAD </p><p>BEEN GENERALLY RESTRAINING NEWSPAPERS FROM </p><p>PUBLISHING STORIES ABOUT THE SECURITY SITUATION.)  A </p><p>JOURNALIST FROM AN ARABIC DAILY TOLD POLOFF NOVEMBER </p><p>19 THAT THE INFORMATION MINISTRY CALLED HIS </p><p>NEWSPAPER NOVEMBER 11 TO ASK WHY THE JOURNAL HAD NOT </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED THE SIDI EL KEBIR MASSACRE WITH A STORY </p><p>AND PHOTOS ON PAGE ONE LIKE OTHER NEWSPAPERS.  THIS </p><p>SOURCE STATED THAT THE MINISTRY ENCOURAGED THE </p><p>NEWSPAPER TO GIVE GREATER EMPHASIS TO TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS; THE JOURNALIST COULDN\'T EXPLAIN EXACTLY </p><p>WHY.  MEANWHILE, THE TELEVISION NEWS HAS REPORTED </p><p>THE MANY INCIDENTS (AFTER THE DAILY TAKE OF STORIES </p><p>ABOUT RALLIES IN FAVOR OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>REFERENDUM).  AFTER THE SIDI EL KEBIR MASSACRE, THE </p><p>TELEVISION EVEN RAN GRUESOME PICTURES OF BODIES, </p><p>REMINISCENT OF BROADCASTS FROM 1994. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  DESPITE THE SPATE OF RECENT INCIDENTS, WE </p><p>DETECT LITTLE CHANGE FROM CITIZENS\' DAILY ROUTINE IN </p><p>ALGIERS, ASIDE FROM A FEW EXTRA ROADBLOCKS.  A </p><p>SENIOR JOURNALIST FROM THE ARABIC DAILY EL-KHABER </p><p>STRESSED TO POLOFF NOVEMBER 18 THAT LIFE IN AND </p><p>AROUND BLIDA APPEARS TO BE MORE OR LESS AS IT WAS </p><p>EARLIER IN THE AUTUMN.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THE </p><p>SPARKLING WATER PRODUCTION PLANT IN SIDI EL-KEBIR IS </p><p>STILL OPERATING, FOR EXAMPLE.  THE AFP CORRESPONDENT </p><p>HERE CAUTIONED POLOFF NOVEMBER 19 THAT SOME OF THE </p><p>MOST PUBLICIZED RECENT INCIDENTS WERE HOUR-LONG </p><p>ASSAULTS AGAINST A FEW HOMES; HE CONTRASTED THIS </p><p>WITH 1993 AND 1994, WHEN LARGER GROUPS SOMETIMES </p><p>OCCUPIED WHOLE VILLAGES FOR AN ENTIRE NIGHT, OR </p><p>ATTACKED MILITARY CAMPS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  THIS SERIES OF TERRORIST ATTACKS DOES NOT </p><p>CAUSE US TO CHANGE OUR ASSESSMENT IN REFTEL THAT THE </p><p>GOA IS MAKING PROGRESS IN REDUCING THE INSURGENCY </p><p>THREAT -- BUT LESS PROGRESS IN REDUCING TERRORISM. </p><p>THE CENTRAL, MOUNTAINOUS WILAYAS OF BLIDA, TIPAZA, </p><p>AND MEDEA, WHERE MOST OF THE RECENT INCIDENTS TOOK </p><p>PLACE, HAVE LONG BEEN STRONGHOLDS OF ARMED </p><p>ISLAMISTS.  EVEN THERE, WE DO NOT SEE CONCERTED </p><p>ATTACKS AGAINST INFRASTRUCTURE, NOR ARE WE AWARE OF </p><p>A SHARPLY HIGHER NUMBER OF MILITARY--AS OPPOSED TO </p><p>CIVILIAN--DEATHS.  THUS, THE MANY INCIDENTS OF </p><p>NOVEMBER 1996 DO NOT YET PROVIDE EVIDENCE EITHER </p><p>THAT TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE GAINED SIGNIFICANT NEW </p><p>CAPABILITIES WITH WHICH TO THREATEN, MUCH LESS </p><p>TOPPLE, THE GOVERNMENT.  MOREOVER, GIVEN THE LONG </p><p>SERIES OF UP AND DOWN CYCLES OF VIOLENCE HERE SINCE </p><p>1992, THESE LATEST ATROCITIES DO NOT SIGNIFY THAT </p><p>THE ALGERIAN MILITARY\'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS HAS SUFFERED A SERIOUS REVERSE. </p><p>RATHER, NOVEMBER 1996 SERVES TO REMIND THAT ENDING </p><p>THE TERRORISM HERE WILL BE A LONG PROCESS AT BEST. </p><p>IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE RECENT INCIDENTS ARE </p><p>DESIGNED, AT LEAST IN PART, TO DISSUADE CITIZENS </p><p>FROM VENTURING FORTH TO VOTE IN THE NOVEMBER 28 </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM.  IF SO, WE HAVE GOTTEN NO </p><p>SENSE THAT THE EXTREMISTS\' INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN IS </p><p>HAVING MUCH IMPACT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STAFFORD </p><p></p></div>
