O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, KTEX, VM, SOE </p><p>SUBJECT: QUANG NAM GARMENT FACTORY:  TRYING TO MAKE IT IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE OF NOWHERE </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------------ </p><p>1.  Quang Nam Province is the home of the Quang Nam Garment </p><p>Company, a small state-owned enterprise with about 800 employees </p><p>and revenues of VND 20 billion per year (about US$1.3 million). </p><p>On a brief visit to the company by DPO and Econoff, they saw a </p><p>clean, well-lit, well-ventilated factory producing its last U.S. </p><p>order for the year.  The visit provides a glimpse of how a small </p><p>factory far from Vietnam\'s commercial and industrial centers is </p><p>dealing with U.S. quotas, competing with larger firms in Hanoi and </p><p>Ho Chi Minh City areas, and handling social accountability issues </p><p>and economic reforms. Interestingly, the company director was </p><p>enthusiastic about the possibility of equitization, or partial </p><p>privatization in this case. </p><p> </p><p>Quang Nam - One of the Poorest Provinces </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  Located south of Danang along the central coast of Vietnam, </p><p>Quang Nam is one of the poorest provinces in the South, with an </p><p>average per capita income of US$230 per year.  The province does </p><p>draw relatively large numbers of foreign tourists to its two </p><p>UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the picturesque town of Hoi </p><p>An and the ancient Cham ruins at My Son.  It is also the province </p><p>with the highest number of "Mothers of Revolutionary Heroes," </p><p>that is, mothers who lost children fighting in the war - against </p><p>us.  Outside of Hoi An, the province is relatively poor and has </p><p>little industry.  Quang Nam is working actively to change this, </p><p>with the development of the Chu Lai Open Economic Zone at the </p><p>southern edge of the province (more to come Septel). </p><p> </p><p>Company Does Assembly Only and is on Its Last U.S. Order </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>3.  Unlike most textile/garment firms in the Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>area, the Quang Nam Garment Company is a state-owned enterprise </p><p>(SOE).  It is one of three subsidiaries of the Hoa Tho Textile </p><p>Company based in Danang and is part of Vinatex, the huge textile </p><p>conglomerate controlled by the Ministry of Industry.  Quang Nam </p><p>Garment Company Director, Mr. Do Ngoc Phuong, showed us around the </p><p>facility.  He noted that the factory simply filled orders provided </p><p>by the mother company in Danang and did not have a separate sales </p><p>or marketing function.  Its traditional markets were Japan, Korea, </p><p>and Taiwan.  Marubeni, a well-known Japanese trading firm, is a </p><p>particularly large customer.  The company cuts and assembles </p><p>garments using fabric and other accessories coming directly from </p><p>the buyer.  The only components sometimes sourced locally are </p><p>thread and packaging materials.  Quang Nam Garment Company has </p><p>about 800 employees and generates revenues of about 20 billion VND </p><p>(about US$1.3 million), which amounts to only about US$1600 per </p><p>worker per year. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Director Phuong stated that after the BTA went into force the </p><p>company began to receive U.S. orders and had gradually shipped </p><p>more and more to the American market.  So far this year the </p><p>company had shipped 250,000 pieces to the U.S., he said.  But due </p><p>to U.S. quotas, the factory was finishing up what he expected </p><p>would be his last U.S. order for some time - a shipment of Dickies- </p><p>brand trousers.  Mr. Phuong stated that the parent company had </p><p>told him not to expect any additional quota or U.S. orders this </p><p>year.  (Note: It is not clear whether the parent company does not </p><p>expect to be allocated additional quota or if it just plans to </p><p>allocate what it receives to other subsidiaries.  End note.)  Mr. </p><p>Phuong said his company would once again focus on its traditional </p><p>export markets, even though these orders were less profitable. </p><p> </p><p>Low Pay, Reasonable Conditions Equals Good Jobs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>5.  Quang Nam Garment Company is located right up against busy </p><p>National Highway 1A.  Our meeting with the director was in a </p><p>shabby, drab administration building.  The factory itself, </p><p>however, was surprisingly clean, well lit, well ventilated, and </p><p>relatively cool on an extremely hot afternoon.  Some parts of the </p><p>factory were air-conditioned.  For the first time Econoff saw </p><p>Vietnamese men working at the sewing machines.  Typically in </p><p>factories near Ho Chi Minh only women fill these jobs.  Salaries </p><p>in Quang Nam are low, however.  Director Phuong reported that </p><p>workers earn VND600,000 per month (less than US$40), which he </p><p>believes is about 70% of the going rate in Ho Chi Minh City.  Mr. </p><p>Phuong noted, however, there was low turnover rate, because in </p><p>Quang Nam, these were considered good jobs with competitive </p><p>salaries.  Many of the factory workers in the Ho Chi Minh City </p><p>area come from places like Quang Nam.  But according to Mr. </p><p>Phuong, these workers -- even with lower pay -- would much rather </p><p>stay close to home where the cost of living is cheaper and </p><p>surroundings more familiar. </p><p> </p><p>6.  When asked about social accountability issues, Director Phuong </p><p>said the parent company handled any necessary certifications, </p><p>although he only knew of the firm obtaining an ISO certification, </p><p>not about meeting any social accountability standards.  He went on </p><p>to say, however, that the company had made a number of changes to </p><p>improve worker conditions for the U.S. market.  He particularly </p><p>noted improved lighting, ventilation, air-conditioning and </p><p>"modernization of some of the production." </p><p> </p><p>7.  Quang Nam Garment Company\'s low wages and stable workforce </p><p>give it a small competitive edge over firms in more expensive Ho </p><p>Chi Minh City.  But Mr. Phuong also noted his central Vietnam </p><p>location makes it more difficult for him to reach customers and </p><p>that shipping is slower and more expensive from there, than from </p><p>HCMC.  As other firms have also told us in central Vietnam, it is </p><p>easier and faster for a company to truck its goods down to Saigon </p><p>Port, rather than use port facilities in Danang, where ships call </p><p>much less frequently. </p><p> </p><p>Plans to Equitize </p><p>----------------- </p><p>8.  When asked about development or expansion plans, Director </p><p>Phuong stated the company was planning to be equitized by 2005, a </p><p>move he strongly supported.  He said he believed it would make </p><p>management and workers feel more personally responsible for the </p><p>company and its success, and would improve its financial position. </p><p>Equitization would only go so far, however.  When asked if he was </p><p>worried about his company going it alone when it had yet to build </p><p>up the most basic sales and marketing functions, he stated that </p><p>even after equitization the parent company would retain a 50% </p><p>interest in the company and would continue to perform those </p><p>functions. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>9.  In a poor, relatively remote provincial location, a steady job </p><p>paying less than US$40 per month is considered good. </p><p>Unfortunately, that appears to be this company\'s only competitive </p><p>edge.  Quang Nam Garment Company, even with its successes, </p><p>exemplifies the problem of many of Vietnam\'s garment firms.  They </p><p>are basically assembly operations capturing only a small portion </p><p>of the value of the final garment.   Although Director Phuong </p><p>realizes he could increase his revenues dramatically if his </p><p>company could do more than just assembly, he does not appear to </p><p>have any plan or means to do so.  Nonetheless, this little textile </p><p>firm in the center of Vietnam is able to compete in the global </p><p>market successfully and be an important employer in an </p><p>economically depressed area of the country.  And while the quota </p><p>on U.S. goods is limiting his ability to get higher profit orders, </p><p>Mr. Phuong seems confident that he can find buyers in his </p><p>traditional Asian markets. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
