SUMMARY: ON OCTOBER 3 AGATTACHE AND </p><p>AGSPECIALIST MET WITH MINISTRY OF </p><p>AGRICULTURAL POLICY DIVISION SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL KORAKAS DG SARROS AND TWO OTHER MINAG </p><p>EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIVISION OF </p><p>ARABLE CROPS TO DISCUSS GREECE\'S POSITION ON </p><p>THE MARGIN OF PREFERENCE (MOP). GREECE WILL </p><p>LIKELY SUPPORT REPLACEMENT OF THE MOP WITH </p><p>TARIFF RATE QUOTAS (TRQS)TO BOOST SUPPORT TO </p><p>THEIR WHEAT GROWERS. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE PROSPECT OF CHEAP WHEAT IMPORTS FROM </p><p>NEARBY BLACK SEA PORTS IS PERCEIVED BY THE </p><p>GOG AS A THREAT TO GREECE\'S PRIMARY SECTOR. </p><p>GREEK IMPORTS OF WHEAT FROM RUSSIA AND </p><p>UKRAINE CAN ARRIVE VIA THE BLACK SEA IN 24 </p><p>HOURS. THE GREEK MINAG PERCEIVES THAT PARTIES </p><p>BENEFITTING MOST FROM THESE SALES ARE </p><p>SHIPPERS AND TRADERS. THE GOG\'S OVERRIDING </p><p>CONCERN IS TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR WHEAT </p><p>PRODUCERS, NOT MILLERS, TRADERS, OR SHIPPERS. </p><p>IN ADDITION, SECRETARY GENERAL KORAKAS </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT UNDER EU POLICY REFORM </p><p>PROPOSALS OF THE MID TERM REVIEW (MTR), DURUM </p><p>PRODUCERS WOULD FACE SEVERE CUTS. THE GOG </p><p>WISHES TO PURSUE POLICIES TO SUPPORT ITS </p><p>WHEAT PRODUCERS. ACCORDING TO OUR </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS, GREECE ALSO SEES A POTENTIAL </p><p>THAT BLACK SEA IMPORTS COULD OPEN THE DOOR </p><p>FOR FUTURE COMPETITION FROM DURUM PRODUCERS </p><p>OF SYRIA OR TURKEY. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  04937  091606Z </p><p> </p><p>3.  MINAG GAVE NO INDICATION THAT IT HAD </p><p>CONSULTED WITH MILLERS OR TRADERS OF WHEAT TO </p><p>DETERMINE A POSITION, NOR DID MINAG REPS </p><p>CONSISTENTLY MAKE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN MARKET </p><p>EFFECTS OF TRQS ON TRADE AND PRODUCTION OF </p><p>SOFT, HARD, OR DURUM WHEAT.  GREECE PRODUCES </p><p>ABOUT 1.4 MILLION TONS OF DURUM WHEAT </p><p>ANNUALLY AND ABOUT 500,00 TONS OF SOFT WHEAT. </p><p>IN RECENT YEARS GREECE HAS IMPORTED NO US </p><p>WHEAT, BUT ANNUAL IMPORTS OF CANADIAN HARD </p><p>WHEAT USED FOR MIXING WITH DOMESTIC SOFT </p><p>WHEAT HAVE BEEN 60,000 TONS. THE MINAG IS </p><p>AWARE THAT IF THE MOP WERE REPLACED BY A TRQ, </p><p>AND THE PRICE OF DURUM WHEAT ON THE EU MARKET </p><p>WERE TO RISE, GREEK PRODUCERS WOULD LIKELY </p><p>RESPOND BY PLANTING MORE DURUM, SWITCHING </p><p>PRODUCTION FROM SOFT WHEAT AND OTHER LESS </p><p>PROFITABLE CROPS AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  MINAG DID NOT DIRECTLY RESPOND TO AGATT\'S </p><p>COMMENTS ON POSSIBLE UNINTENDED INFLATIONARY </p><p>ASPECTS OF TRQS, ALTHOUGH MINAG ACKNOWLEDGED </p><p>THAT INFLATION OF FOOD PRICES IS A CONCERN. </p><p>WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE TIMING OF ACTION ON </p><p>THE MOP, SECRETARY KORAKAS REMARKED THAT "THE </p><p>SOONER WE ESTABLISH REFERENCE PERIODS, THE </p><p>BETTER."  SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME04937 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
