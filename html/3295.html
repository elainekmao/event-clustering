<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 003819 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR S/CT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, CVIS </p><p>SUBJECT: HOMELAND SECURITY COORDINATOR </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 126082 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In response to Reftel, counterterrorism and homeland </p><p>security responsibilities fall to a number of agencies in </p><p>Jordan.  The General Intelligence Directorate (GID) is </p><p>responsible for internal security and most counterterrorism </p><p>operations in Jordan, and as such has disrupted several </p><p>terrorist cells in Jordan in the past few years.  The </p><p>Protective Security Directorate (PSD), in close cooperation </p><p>with the GID, is responsible for maintaining security at all </p><p>diplomatic facilities in Jordan.  The Jordanian Army, which </p><p>patrols Jordan\'s borders, has intercepted several groups of </p><p>terrorists trying to infilitrate the West Bank and Israel </p><p>with weapons and explosives.  The JAF\'s Director of Military </p><p>Security also conducts counterterrorism and internal </p><p>dissident surveillance operations against civilians in close </p><p>cooperation with the GID and PSD.  As responsibilities are </p><p>split between the agencies, there is no one "national </p><p>coordinator" for counterterrorism.  Said Kheir, as Director </p><p>of the GID, is the highest-ranking official with </p><p>counterterrorism responsibilities.  The Director of the PSD, </p><p>Tayseen Shurdom, is also an important point-of-contact on </p><p>counterterrorism issues. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
