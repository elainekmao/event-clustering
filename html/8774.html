The pervasive looting that occurred throughout Iraq in </p><p>the wake of the conflict created several challenges for </p><p>future humanitarian assistance and reconstruction efforts. </p><p>One of those challenges affecting many sectors was the loss </p><p>of official documentation for identification and operational </p><p>purposes.  From hospitals to courthouses, the loss of </p><p>important documents continues to complicate recovery </p><p>efforts.  In the wake of the conflict, the successful </p><p>protection of important documents by dedicated civil </p><p>servants and Coalition forces varied considerably by sector </p><p>and by governorate.  This variation exists for documents in </p><p>all government sectors throughout southern Iraq.  The </p><p>information contained in the ration card system of the PDS </p><p>could be a valuable resource to fill gaps in official </p><p>documentation as it is rebuilt.  Vulnerable groups that may </p><p>have lost their ration cards or other documents will need </p><p>special assistance in obtaining documentation necessary to </p><p>access much needed humanitarian assistance and basic </p><p>services.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS LOST </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  In the wake of the conflict and the looting that </p><p>followed, a significant portion of official documents housed </p><p>in government buildings were destroyed.  This included </p><p>documents from municipal or governorate offices, passport </p><p>offices, hospitals, food ration centers, schools, police </p><p>stations, prisons, and courthouses throughout southern Iraq. </p><p>There was variation across sectors and governorates in the </p><p>extent of document loss.    The case of courthouses </p><p>illustrates the variation.  In An Nasiriyah, nearly all </p><p>legal documents from the courthouse were burned.  In other </p><p>towns like Al Kut, staff protected the documents at the </p><p>courthouse by patrolling the grounds themselves during the </p><p>looting.  Other staff of courthouses such as in Al Amarah, </p><p>took documents, including property ownership files, home to </p><p>protect them. </p><p> </p><p>3.  As security improves and government buildings are </p><p>rehabilitated, civil servants in many sectors are bringing </p><p>computers and documents back to work.  While this will begin </p><p>to rebuild databases, the gaps from destroyed documents will </p><p>remain. This will create serious obstacles to the new civil </p><p>administration in such things as identifying citizens and </p><p>building an accurate census base. </p><p> </p><p>4.  In Basrah, looters destroyed many identification </p><p>documents at the civil courthouse. Some documents, however, </p><p>were identified and prioritized for protection by the </p><p>International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Coalition </p><p>forces.  IOM realized the importance of protecting the </p><p>remaining civilian identification files in Basrah because </p><p>the files were critical to identifying and protecting </p><p>internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq.  With the </p><p>support of the DART, IOM is implementing a project to help </p><p>local staff of the civil courthouse to collect and organize </p><p>the remaining identification documents for Basrah </p><p>Governorate.  Since there will undoubtedly be gaps in this </p><p>database, other sources of information on the population of </p><p>Iraq and their needs and vulnerability are needed. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>DOCUMENTATION FOR THE PDS RATION CARD SYSTEM </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  With the help of the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) and </p><p>the U.S. Government, the public distribution system (PDS) </p><p>for food and other rations is restarting across Iraq.  This </p><p>massive distribution system has been meeting the food needs </p><p>of Iraqis and is implemented and monitored through careful </p><p>record keeping on the numbers of individuals throughout the </p><p>country.  In Basrah, the ration  Ration Registration centers </p><p>(RRCs), Ministry of Trade (MOT) offices, and warehouses were </p><p>looted and many paper documents burned.  However, committed </p><p>staff took computers and the detailed ration card database </p><p>home for protection.  Once this data is back in use, it can </p><p>serve as an important resource for reassembling census and </p><p>other information on the population of Iraq.  Some form of </p><p>liaison between civil courts and the managers of the ration </p><p>card systemPDS database could facilitate appropriate </p><p>coverage of the population needing identity documents </p><p>reissued. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Since their access to food and other important </p><p>commodities such as pharmaceuticals was based on their </p><p>ration cards, Iraqis usually guarded these cards closely and </p><p>kept them up-to-date.  Families were quick to report new </p><p>births and careful to register changes in their place of </p><p>residence to ensure receipt of a proper ration.  Since the </p><p>conflict began, the staff at 34 ration centersRRCs in Basrah </p><p>Governorate has been proactively registering returnees </p><p>(including 10 newly returned prisoners of war from the Iran- </p><p>Iraq conflict, and ten families returning from Kirkuk), and </p><p>"exceptional" cases (ex-prisoners, draft dodgers, and </p><p>political dissidents).  Three hundred new infants have also </p><p>been registered.  They have also registered new families </p><p>arriving to the area. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The protection of ration cards by individual families </p><p>along with the well-designed and managed record </p><p>systemdatabase makes the ration card databaseit one of the </p><p>most accurate and up-to-date forms of documentation on the </p><p>population of Iraq.  Even before the conflict, ration cards </p><p>were often used by Iraqis for identification purposes when </p><p>applying for a passport or other special papers or </p><p>allowances from the government. </p><p> </p><p>8.  According to the Director of the Main Distribution </p><p>Center for Basrah Governorate, his database is safe and </p><p>complete.  The hardcopy ration cards held by individual </p><p>families list the name of the head of household, the number </p><p>of family members in the household, and the date of birth of </p><p>any children under one year of age.  It also lists the house </p><p>number, neighborhood, village, and district as well as the </p><p>name and reference number of the distribution food/flour </p><p>agent.  A neighborhood leader must certify that each family </p><p>lives in his area and new cards were issued every November </p><p>for the entire next calendar year.  The last cards were </p><p>issued in November 2002. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Further details on each family are recorded on the </p><p>computer database for the ration systemPDS.  The database </p><p>contains the name, gender, date of birth, and civil </p><p>identification number of each family member.  The computer </p><p>database also contains a record of movements of families </p><p>from town to town or governorate to governorate.  The ration </p><p>card database also contains information about people </p><p>arrested by the former regime.  Before the conflict, the MOT </p><p>would inform the ration centerRRC to temporarily delete an </p><p>individual sent to prison from a family\'s ration card.  The </p><p>ration center would then write a note for the food agent to </p><p>withhold the ration for that individual. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITHOUT RATION CARDS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  Under the old system, when a family moved they had to </p><p>request written proof from their old previous RRC ration </p><p>center that they had been deleted from that center\'s list </p><p>before being able to register in the town or neighborhood of </p><p>new residence.  They then had to take that certificate to </p><p>the ration centerRRC at their new residence before receiving </p><p>rations.  The transfer of registration used to take about </p><p>one month to process under the old system.  The disruption </p><p>caused by the conflict is already highlighting problems with </p><p>this system for IDPs who have recently moved.  Arabs </p><p>returning from the North to Basrah will have problems </p><p>getting written proof of their removal from the PDS in the </p><p>North before returning to the South.  Several such families </p><p>had turned up at the main ration centerRRC in Basrah by late </p><p>May and were denied new ration cards due to lack of proper </p><p>paperwork.  In June, with the assistance of WFP and support </p><p>of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) Lower South, it </p><p>was decided that those without ration cards, or registered </p><p>in a governorate to which they would not return, would be </p><p>provisionally registered in the governorate of their current </p><p>residence and receive a PDS ration in June.  Provisional </p><p>registration has begun in An Nasiriyah, Basrah, and Maysan. </p><p>WFP is also working with the MOT in Samawah to begin the </p><p>process there. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Other families to be enrolled provisionally in June </p><p>turned away from the ration center in Basrah include those </p><p>returning from Iran who have very old identification cards </p><p>from the early 1990s.  Many do not even have these.Three to </p><p>four such families were turned away by the ration center </p><p>staff in Basrah and told to get proper identification before </p><p>they can be registered for the PDS.  Provisional </p><p>registration of families lacking up-to-date identity, </p><p>citizenship, and marriage documentation is only a temporary </p><p>"fix\', and the issue of assisting families acquire </p><p>appropriate documentation is one yet to be addressed.  The </p><p>importance of addressing this issue is seen in Al Kut, where </p><p>, around the same time,Coalition Civil Affairs personnel </p><p>have received complaintswerereceiving complaints from IDP </p><p>families that the Director of Education would not let their </p><p>children register for school due to lack of proper </p><p>documentation. </p><p> </p><p>12.  In addition to IDP families that may lack the proper </p><p>paperwork needed to register for their food ration, non- </p><p>governmental organizations and WFP are also identifying many </p><p>families that had their ration cards taken away by the </p><p>former regime.  Marsh Arabs or families of opponents of the </p><p>former regime were reportedly punished by having their </p><p>ration cards revoked.  Estimates on the number of such </p><p>families vary widely from 20 percent of the population in </p><p>places like Al Amarah to only a handful of people in other </p><p>towns. These individuals and families will also be enrolled, </p><p>or reinstated into the PDS in June. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  The loss of documents in southern Iraq may pose special </p><p>challenges to the CPA\'s ability to provide basic services </p><p>and humanitarian assistance to the population.  As </p><p>assessments continue to determine who has what, the </p><p>rebuilding of data on the population of Iraq and their needs </p><p>will resemble assembling a complicated jigsaw puzzle. </p><p>Efforts are already ongoing to address this problem in each </p><p>sector, often as a component of individual humanitarian </p><p>assistance programs.  However, more targeted support to </p><p>projects that are specifically addressing this crosscutting </p><p>issue of documentation recovery and protection are needed. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
