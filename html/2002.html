INADVERTENTLY, BOTH BUSH AND HIS </p><p>    SECRETARY OF STATE, COLIN POWELL, HAD LIT THE FUSE </p><p>    WITH THEIR SELECTION OF THE SAUDI-BORN BILLIONAIRE </p><p>    DISSIDENT, OSAMA BIN LADEN, AS THEIR PRIME </p><p>    SUSPECT.  THE MAN IS AN ARAB AND A MUSLIM, ALBEIT </p><p>    ONE WHO BELIEVES IN A VERSION OF THE KORAN WHICH </p><p>    ESPOUSES VIOLENCE AS PART OF THE WORSHIP OF ALLAH. </p><p>    BUT THE WAVE OF ATTACKS ON MUSLIMS OR PEOPLE OF </p><p>    MIDDLE EASTERN APPEARANCE IN THE U.
