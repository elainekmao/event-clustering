<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000027 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:12/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  Why Nigeria\'s PDP Governors Could Not Lose </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Abuja 0012 </p><p>      01 Abuja 2878 </p><p>      Abuja 0016 </p><p>      Abuja 0015 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM TIMOTHY D. ANDREWS.  REASON: 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The PDP\'s national convention (Refs C and D) </p><p>was more competitive than caucuses that renominated every PDP </p><p>governor regardless of his popularity or lack of it.  However, </p><p>this praise is faint indeed, as the gubernatorial caucuses were </p><p>blatantly rigged while the national convention was more subtly </p><p>manipulated.  Each iteration of intrigue and manipulation helps </p><p>establish the context for the next one, and mutual knowledge of </p><p>one another\'s compromising behavior (not love of democracy) is </p><p>the tie that binds many senior political figures.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) While predicting a first-round victory for President </p><p>Olusegun Obasanjo at the January 3-5 national convention of the </p><p>ruling People\'s Democratic Party (PDP), Deputy Senate President </p><p>Ibrahim Mantu January 3 told DCM that the vote would not be as </p><p>lopsided as it was in late December\'s gubernatorial primaries. </p><p>Mantu commented that over 3,000 delegates had cast ballots in </p><p>the "primary" (caucus) that returned him as the PDP nominee for </p><p>the Plateau Central Senatorial District.  Since each senator </p><p>represented about one-third of the state, Mantu continued, it </p><p>would have been proportionate for the gubernatorial "primary" </p><p>to feature approximately 9,000 delegates.  Instead, Governor </p><p>Joshua Dariye was returned as the PDP nominee with only 212 </p><p>delegates participating in the caucus, most of whom were party </p><p>or state government officials beholden to him.  PDP members in </p><p>Plateau had directly elected just 51 delegates (three from each </p><p>of the 17 local government areas), and Dariye had a strong hold </p><p>on most of them also. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Mantu expressed disgust at the lack of fairness, </p><p>transparency and public accountability embedded in the </p><p>structure of the gubernatorial caucuses.  The "non-incumbent </p><p>aspirants who went to court to challenge the procedure were </p><p>right," Mantu said.  Never in his 23 years in politics had he </p><p>seen such a blatantly rigged nomination process.  The party\'s </p><p>national convention would be open and transparent, however, </p><p>Mantu averred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) He traced the origins of the gubernatorial nominating </p><p>process to the PDP convention of November 2001 that ousted </p><p>Barnabas Gemade as party chairman, replacing him with Audu </p><p>Ogbeh.  It was during the course of that convention that </p><p>amendments to the PDP constitution were adopted that reduced </p><p>the elected delegates to gubernatorial primaries from one per </p><p>ward to three per Local Government Area and increased the </p><p>number of ex-officio delegates.  The amendments were adopted by </p><p>voice vote with virtually none of the delegates ever having </p><p>seen the text, to say nothing of appreciating its implications, </p><p>said Mantu. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: Each LGA consists of least 20 wards, and the </p><p>average is about 24, so the new amendment cut popularly-elected </p><p>delegates by a factor of eight while increasing sharply those </p><p>likely to be beholden to incumbent governors.  This was part of </p><p>the price the Presidency paid to gain incumbent governors\' </p><p>support for dumping Gemade.  They knew (Ref B) that Gemade </p><p>would help them return to power and feared Ogbeh\'s reputation </p><p>for integrity, so they insisted on rules that would make it </p><p>difficult for any challenger to unseat them.  These changes </p><p>also gave the governors increased power over their delegations </p><p>to the national convention, creating the circumstances that </p><p>convinced aggrieved governors that they could successfully </p><p>challenge the President (Ref D).  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) While lauding Ogbeh as "honest" and "principled," Mantu </p><p>commented that his accession nonetheless was regrettably marred </p><p>by the same sort manipulation that had brought Gemade to power </p><p>before him (when the Presidency had wanted to prevent Sunday </p><p>Awoniyi from gaining the chairmanship).  When one gains office </p><p>through intrigue, Mantu continued, the victory is tarnished, </p><p>and one lacks the authority to act forcefully.  One may also be </p><p>forced to compromise one\'s principles in support of one\'s </p><p>patron, Mantu suggested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: Mantu makes a trenchant point; only those </p><p>genuinely elected in an open and transparent process possess </p><p>clear moral authority (mandate) to govern.  Everyone else is </p><p>diminished.  Public corruption plays a critical role also. </p><p>Many senior politicians have indulged in activities that they </p><p>would not want publicized and are thus compromised.  Mutual </p><p>knowledge of this compromise establishes limits on what </p><p>politicians can do: Politician A exposes Politician B\'s </p><p>acceptance of bribes at the risk of B telling the story of A\'s </p><p>contract over-invoicing scheme.  Since money drives the wheels </p><p>of politics and public corruption is a faster and easier route </p><p>to wealth than legitimate business, relatively "clean" </p><p>politicians tend to be a small minority and thus unable to </p><p>effect systemic change.  Meanwhile, many elites work within </p><p>this framework of mutual compromise; knowledge that everyone </p><p>else has a skeleton in the closet makes one less worried about </p><p>one\'s own secret shame.  Corruption surprises no one and, as </p><p>long as it is not too blatant, arouses little indignation.  The </p><p>Lagos-based "Guardian" January 6 carried a photo of a policeman </p><p>helping someone carry a heavily-laden "Ghana-Must-Go" bag.  The </p><p>woven plastic "Ghana-Must-Go" Bag is used to carry large sums </p><p>of cash and has become the symbol of money\'s role in politics. </p><p>The image of an officer of the law helping to enable corruption </p><p>may strike the Western observer as ironic or amusing, but most </p><p>Nigerian elites find it utterly mundane and normal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  President Obasanjo may or may not </p><p>be personally free of corruption.  Views on that subject vary, </p><p>and we\'ve seen nothing that would indict him.  However, his </p><p>acquiescence to associates\' use of monetary blandishments and </p><p>his own penchant for undermining the position of fellow PDP </p><p>members with whom he disagrees do nothing to build a stronger </p><p>base for genuine participatory democracy here.  The allegation </p><p>of Obasanjo\'s intent to stop the candidacies of some incumbent </p><p>governors (Ref D) that sparked the governors\' insurrection at </p><p>the national convention quite likely was a fabrication by an </p><p>Obasanjo antagonist at State House itself.  But the governors </p><p>believed the story because of Obasanjo\'s previous efforts to </p><p>unseat (or prevent the otherwise probable election of) fellow </p><p>party leaders with whom he was in conflict. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT CONCLUDED:  The PDP\'s national convention was </p><p>more competitive than the gubernatorial nomination process that </p><p>Mantu derided, but that is vanishingly faint praise.  Balloting </p><p>and vote-counting were transparent and open, but not much else </p><p>related to the convention was.  The critical accreditation </p><p>process was obviously manipulated, with respect both to its </p><p>timing and the acceptance of approximately 250 delegates (who </p><p>were in no original delegate count we ever saw and whose votes </p><p>ultimately were superfluous, Ref C).  Moreover, a requirement </p><p>that each delegate thumbprint his/her ballot made the secret </p><p>ballot far less so.  In November of 2001, we said (ref B) that </p><p>it was "now up to the President and the new party hierarchy to </p><p>continue to mend today\'s wounds and, perhaps, shift the party </p><p>to a more transparent and democratic tomorrow."  It still is. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
