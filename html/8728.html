(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Secretary Bolton:  Your visit to the UAE </p><p>will provide an excellent opportunity to discuss </p><p>our concerns about Iran with the UAEG.  We have </p><p>secured a meeting with de facto Foreign Minister, </p><p>Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan, who has primary </p><p>responsibility for the UAE\'s bilateral relationship </p><p>with Iran.  Unfortunately, Armed Forces Chief of </p><p>Staff LTG Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (with </p><p>whom you recently met in Washington) will not be in </p><p>the UAE at the time of your visit.  We have also </p><p>scheduled a meeting with the Executive Director of </p><p>Dubai Ports and Custom Authority, Sultan bin </p><p>Sulayem.  Bin Sulayem is our primary interlocutor </p><p>on Dubai-related exports controls issues. </p><p> </p><p>IRAN </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) The UAE has long viewed Iran as a far </p><p>greater threat to its existence than that posed by </p><p>Iraq.  With a small national population (between </p><p>600-700,000 Emirati citizens), ten percent of the </p><p>world\'s oil reserves and among the region\'s most </p><p>developed economies, the UAE\'s vulnerabilities are </p><p>not inconsiderable.  Chief of Staff Shaykh Muhammad </p><p>bin Zayid, in a June 11 meeting, briefed me that in </p><p>the recently held GCC Intelligence Chief\'s semi- </p><p>annual meeting, there was consensus that with </p><p>Saddam\'s regime removed, the primary threat in the </p><p>region is Iran.  The Emiratis have viewed with </p><p>alarm Iran\'s nuclear and WMD-collection effort and </p><p>have offered to work with us to coordinate on </p><p>intelligence-collection efforts. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S) The combination of Iran\'s robust illicit </p><p>arms collection effort and increasing domestic </p><p>instability has greatly unsettled the Emiratis.  De </p><p>facto FM Hamdan told me June 11 that the UAEG has </p><p>determined that Khatami -- in whom they held great </p><p>hopes -- has been completely sidelined by the </p><p>hardliners.  Hamdan shared that it is now President </p><p>Zayid\'s view that the Iranian leadership writ large </p><p>cannot be trusted.  For the UAE, this has </p><p>translated into a major setback in the resolution </p><p>of their dispute with Tehran over Iran\'s occupation </p><p>of three islands in the Gulf claimed by the UAE. </p><p>Hamdan had personally invested time and prestige -- </p><p>making several journeys to Tehran -- to hammer out </p><p>a resolution on the largest of the three islands, </p><p>Abu Musa.  At one point last year, Hamdan believed </p><p>that a resolution was close and had extended, on </p><p>behalf of President Zayid, an invitation to Khatami </p><p>to visit the UAE.  Those efforts now appear to have </p><p>been for naught, though Khatami\'s invitation still </p><p>stands.  On June 11, Hamdan briefed that relations </p><p>have soured to the point that the Iranians have </p><p>arrested an Emirati national of Iranian origins on </p><p>espionage charges.  This despite, in Hamdan\'s </p><p>words, the "hundreds of Iranian agentsz\' the UAEG </p><p>knows are operating in the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Despite the UAE\'s strained political </p><p>relationship with Iran, bilateral trade ties are </p><p>strong and growing.  The number one destination for </p><p>goods transshipped through Dubai is Iran, and the </p><p>UAE is a major destination for Iranian agricultural </p><p>and mass produced consumer products.  Abu Dhabi </p><p>shares production from an off-shore oil field with </p><p>Iran, and monthly consultative meetings proceed </p><p>cordially regardless of political developments. </p><p>Nonetheless, Abu Dhabi\'s political concerns </p><p>regarding Iran led to the decision to develop the </p><p>multi-billion dollar Dolphin project to pipe </p><p>natural gas to the UAE from Qatar -- despite the </p><p>fact that Iranian gas sources would certainly have </p><p>been cheaper, particularly for the northern </p><p>Emirates (including Dubai).  Business may be </p><p>business, but clearly there are limits (especially </p><p>for Abu Dhabi), and particularly when it comes to </p><p>sensitive national security items like fuel for the </p><p>UAE\'s massive power and water sector. </p><p> </p><p>IRANIAN MEDDLING IN IRAQ </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) The Emiratis have also expressed grave </p><p>concern about what they believe is outright Iranian </p><p>meddling in the internal affairs of Iraq.  The </p><p>Emiratis would like to see a democratic process </p><p>unfold in the post-Saddam era, one in which all of </p><p>Iraq\'s ethnic and religious elements are </p><p>represented.  They fear that Iranian intervention, </p><p>particularly via the Badr Corps, may tip the scales </p><p>in favor of those advocating a Shi\'a/Iranian-style </p><p>theocracy. </p><p> </p><p>GETTING TO YES ON AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Hamdan is committed to finalizing an Article </p><p>98 agreement with us, preferably via the exchange </p><p>of diplomatic notes.  We have traded suggestions on </p><p>language and are working through the often </p><p>laborious UAE interagency process to schedule a </p><p>video teleconference with PM/B.  While we had hoped </p><p>to have an agreement ready for signature by the end </p><p>of June, it now appears that an early fall signing </p><p>ceremony is more likely.  I recommend that you use </p><p>your meeting with Hamdan to press him on the need </p><p>for an early closure of this issue. </p><p> </p><p>EXPORT CONTROLS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The UAE political leadership is strongly </p><p>committed to working with us on export control </p><p>issues and fully recognizes that this is a top </p><p>bilateral priority.  Internal bureaucratic </p><p>wrangling at the federal level over which Ministry </p><p>should take the lead on this issue has now been </p><p>resolved in favor of the Ministry of Interior.  A </p><p>USG interagency team is visiting the UAE June 14-16 </p><p>to relaunch our comprehensive "road map" of export </p><p>controls and border security training programs, and </p><p>has found strong support at the federal level both </p><p>at the MFA and Interior Ministry.  The Dubai Ports </p><p>and Customs Authority (DPA, which runs Jebel Ali </p><p>and Port Rashid, together the 12th largest port in </p><p>the world) has separately indicated its interest in </p><p>working with us directly on EXBS issues, </p><p>particularly enforcement, and DPA is also pursuing </p><p>participation in Homeland Security\'s Container </p><p>Security Initiative (CSI). </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) This cable was coordinated with Amconsul </p><p>Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
