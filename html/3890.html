<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001848 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10-04-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PINR, CE, Political Parties, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  President Kumaratunga\'s swipe at the PM sparks </p><p>another cohabitation dustup </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 1828, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  In a recent speech, President </p><p>Kumraratunga accused Prime Minister Wickremesinghe of </p><p>soliciting bribes years ago.  The accusation has </p><p>prompted another cohabitation dustup, with the PM\'s </p><p>supporters responding with salvos of their own aimed at </p><p>Kumraratunga.  In a more muted fashion, Kumaratunga and </p><p>her advisers are also hitting out at the GSL\'s peace </p><p>initiative.  The sum result of the latest fracas is that </p><p>it probably strengthened the PM\'s determination to take </p><p>steps to rein in Kumaratunga\'s powers.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Kumraratunga Lashes Out at PM </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The cohabitation waters are riled again.  In a </p><p>September 29 speech given in the north-central city of </p><p>Anuradhapura, President Kumaratunga lashed out at Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe.  In widely publicized comments, </p><p>the president effectively accused Wickremesinghe of </p><p>soliciting bribes when he was education minister in the </p><p>late 1980\'s.  Without providing any evidence, she </p><p>asserted that the Wickremesinghe and his staff had </p><p>demanded that she (Kumaratunga) pay 25,000 Rupees </p><p>(roughly USD 260) in order to gain admittance for her </p><p>son, Vimukthi, to Royal College, a well-known local high </p><p>school.  The president asserted that she would not pay </p><p>the bribe and her son did not gain admittance. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) (((Note:  The latest presidential version of why </p><p>her son did not get into Royal College is a new one.  In </p><p>the past, she has asserted that Wickremesinghe had </p><p>blackballed her son from getting into the prestigious </p><p>school for political reasons.  She did not mention the </p><p>bribery charge.  Whatever the truth is regarding her </p><p>son\'s application to get into the school, it is apparent </p><p>that whatever happened made a deep imprint on </p><p>Kumrartunga, with many observers citing it as one of the </p><p>key reasons she does not get along with the PM.  End </p><p>Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Dustup Ensues </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The accusation has led to another cohabitation </p><p>dustup, with the PM\'s supporters harshly criticizing </p><p>Kumraratunga.  Commerce Minister Ravi Karunanayake, a </p><p>bitter foe of Kumaratunga\'s, was quoted as stating:  "We </p><p>know the president attacks us (other ministers in the </p><p>government) and we don\'t take those insults seriously, </p><p>but we will not allow her to cast aspersions on the </p><p>prime minister."  Buddhist Welfare Minister W.J.M. </p><p>Lokubandara stated:  "We must understand that we cannot </p><p>have cohabitation with the president under the present </p><p>circumstances."  According to press reports, the weekly </p><p>cabinet chaired by the PM on October 2 also turned into </p><p>a hotbed of anti-Kumaratunga invective.  In obviously </p><p>leaked reports, various ministers were cited as calling </p><p>for Kumraratunga\'s immediate impeachment, among other </p><p>things. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The ferocity of the response to her accusation, </p><p>including the generally negative press play it </p><p>generated, put the president a bit on the defensive. </p><p>Her staff asserted that she had been misquoted, but </p><p>video feed of the speech showed her making the bribery </p><p>claim.  Her staff then took another tack -- Harim </p><p>Peiris, one of the president\'s press spokesman, told us </p><p>that "she was just joking."  Be that as it may, the </p><p>damage had been done, with many finding the president\'s </p><p>remarks beyond the pale.  Taranjit Sandhu, polchief at </p><p>the Indian High Commission, told us that Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>comments "had badly backfired.  The PM is widely </p><p>respected and few people believe that he is corrupt. </p><p>Most people took the president\'s remarks as another sign </p><p>of her own instability." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Chipping away at the Peace Initiative </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) In a more muted fashion (compared with her </p><p>Anurahapura remarks in any case), the president and her </p><p>advisers have also been criticizing the GSL\'s peace </p><p>initiative.  In the latest salvo, the president\'s office </p><p>publicly issued a letter she had sent to the PM dated </p><p>September 27 in which she expressed concern over two </p><p>matters.  First, she warned the PM not to take any </p><p>rushed steps related to "high security zones" that might </p><p>affect "national security."   (Note:  At the recent </p><p>talks in Thailand, the two sides agreed to form a joint </p><p>body to examine high security zones in the north and </p><p>east, with the aim of allowing increased numbers of </p><p>displaced persons to return to their point of origin.) </p><p>Second, she asked to PM to look into press reports that </p><p>the Tamil Tigers had held a large graduation ceremony </p><p>for military cadets on September 19 in the Trincomalee </p><p>area (see Reftel). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) In addition to the president\'s letter, Harim </p><p>Peiris spoke to the press regarding the peace process, </p><p>stating that the Tamil Tigers needed to be disarmed </p><p>before the GSL agreed to the formation of an interim </p><p>administration for the north and east.  Explaining his </p><p>stance, he was quoted as commenting, "A heavily armed </p><p>LTTE taking over government-controlled areas is </p><p>untenable."  (Note:  It is widely expected that the </p><p>Tigers would dominate any interim administration formed </p><p>for the north and east.)  Reacting to Peiris\' comments, </p><p>Jehan Perera, the head of a local think-tank, told us </p><p>that the disarming of the Tigers could not even be </p><p>considered at this point as the group would not even </p><p>hear of it.  To make such a demand, "could end the peace </p><p>process," Perera averred. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) For his part, the PM did not publicly comment on </p><p>the president\'s accusation, although he was said to be </p><p>infuriated in private.  The sum result of the latest </p><p>fracas is that it probably strengthened the PM\'s </p><p>determination to take steps to rein in Kumaratunga\'s </p><p>powers.  Already, the PM is moving a bill in Parliament </p><p>meant to constrain the president\'s power to call new </p><p>elections.  It is not clear whether the bill has the </p><p>needed support, but the latest outburst by Kumaratunga </p><p>probably helped the PM\'s cause. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) In terms of the latest soundings re the peace </p><p>process, the president seems to be trying to appear as </p><p>skeptical and hard-line toward the Tigers as possible in </p><p>order to accuse the GSL of naivete if the process is </p><p>somehow derailed.  She seems a bit tentative on the </p><p>subject, however, perhaps because she does not want to </p><p>alienate a public which strongly supports the GSL\'s </p><p>peace initiative at this time.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
