(C) SUMMARY: DURING A MARCH 26 COURTESY CALL ON EU </p><p>AFFAIRS MINISTER ROCCO BUTTIGLIONE, THE AMBASSADOR DISCUSSED </p><p>THE EU CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AND THE POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC ISSUES SURROUNDING EU ENLARGEMENT.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE MINISTER\'S RECENT UNHELPFUL COMMENTS ON </p><p>IRAQ, AND POINTED OUT THAT THEY WERE OUT OF SYNC WITH THE </p><p>POSITION OF PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI. HE OFFERED TO GIVE THE </p><p>MINISTER A MORE DETAILED BRIEFING ON THE REASONS FOR THE U.S. </p><p>AND ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CONCERNS ABOUT IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) THE AMBASSADOR CALLED ON EUROPEAN UNION AFFAIRS </p><p>MINISTER ROCCO BUTTIGLIONE ON MARCH 26. THE MINISTER WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY HIS DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR. THE AMBASSADOR WAS </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY POLMC, A/ECMIN AND ECONCOUNS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE AMBASSADOR BEGAN THE MEETING BY NOTING THAT THE </p><p>U.S.-EU RELATIONSHIP WAS A CRUCIAL ONE, OF POLITICAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE TO THE U.S.  THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>BETWEEN ITALY AND THE U.S. IS VERY STRONG, HE EMPHASIZED. </p><p>THERE WILL, OF COURSE, ALWAYS BE TRADE ISSUES AND OTHER </p><p>IRRITANTS.  HOWEVER, THE OVERRIDING STRENGTH OF THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP IS THE CRUCIAL ELEMENT.  THE MINISTER AGREED, </p><p>NOTING THAT THE STRONG BILATERAL ALLIANCE ON ANTI-TERRORISM </p><p>AND THE PROTECTION OF PEACE, FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ARE KEY. </p><p>EVEN ON TRADE ISSUES SUCH AS STEEL, ITALY HAS KEPT IN MIND </p><p>THE CRUCIAL NATURE OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, AND REACTED </p><p>LESS DRAMATICALLY ON THE SPECIFIC TRADE ISSUE, SEEKING </p><p>DIALOGUE INSTEAD OF CONFRONTATION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01610  01 OF 03  291341Z </p><p> </p><p>ITALY WITHIN THE EU </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE MINISTER SUGGESTED THAT THE EU SHOULD BE </p><p>CONSIDERED AS ONE PART OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC COMMUNITY. </p><p>THE ITALIAN AND UK GOVERNMENTS AGREED ON THIS BASIC TENET, HE </p><p>STRESSED, WHILE OTHERS IN THE EU SEEMED LESS AWARE OF ITS </p><p>TRUTH.  "WE ARE MOVING FROM THE RHINE-CENTERED EU," HE SAID. </p><p>ONCE FRANCE AND GERMANY DOMINATED THE EU, AND ONCE THEY </p><p>DECIDED AN ISSUE, THE EU POSITION WAS DECIDED.  NOW, INSTEAD, </p><p>THERE IS A DIFFERENT LEADERSHIP MODEL. "ALTHOUGH THE UK HAS A </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF THE LEFT, WHILE WE ARE CENTER-RIGHT, WE ARE </p><p>UNITED BY OUR PERCEPTION OF THE CHANGING WORLD.  WE BOTH </p><p>UNDERSTAND THAT THE OLD MODEL NO LONGER WORKS IN A GLOBALIZED </p><p>WORLD."   POINTING TO THE WAY WORLD WARS I AND II HAD SEEN </p><p>TANKS AND AIRCRAFT DESTROY THE USEFULNESS OF TRENCHES AS </p><p>DEFENSES, BUTTIGLIONE REFERRED TO GLOBALIZATION AND LIBERAL </p><p>MARKET ECONOMIES, IN WHICH TARIFFS AND NON-TARIFF BARRIERS </p><p>COULD NO LONGER BE USED TO DEFEND DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES. </p><p>INSTEAD, "WE CAN ONLY DEFEND OUR WORKERS BY GIVING THEM </p><p>SKILLS AND EDUCATION AND HELPING THEM TO RETRAIN WHEN THEY </p><p>LOSE THEIR JOBS." </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ITALY AND GERMANY ARE THE TWO COUNTRIES MOST IN FAVOR </p><p>OF POLITICAL UNITY IN THE EU.  THIS POSITION, HE EXPLAINED, </p><p>WAS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE PARTY IN POWER BUT ON THE HISTORY OF </p><p>THE TWO NATIONS.  "THE MYTH OF THE NATION STATE COLLAPSED FOR </p><p>US IN WORLD WAR II, " SAID BUTTIGLIONE.  WHILE THE BRITISH </p><p>HAD SEEN THEIR RULING CLASS FACE THE SITUATION WITH COURAGE </p><p>AND DECISIVENESS, ITALY AND GERMANY SAW THEIR RULING CLASSES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01610  01 OF 03  291341Z </p><p>COLLAPSE.   WHILE THE BRITISH NATION STATE FADED GRADUALLY </p><p>OVER DECADES, THAT OF ITALY AND GERMANY IMPLODED OVERNIGHT. </p><p>ITALY AND GERMANY SAW THE EU AS A NECESSITY, WHILE THE </p><p>BRITISH DID NOT.  HOWEVER, BUTTIGLIONE ARGUED, "THE EU IS A </p><p>NECESSITY FOR THE UK TOO."  THE EU IS A CREATION OF ITS </p><p>MEMBER STATES\' NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTIES, WITHIN THE </p><p>TRANSATLANTIC FRAMEWORK. </p><p> </p><p>EU CONVENTION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AS FOR THE EU, THE MINISTER STATED, "WE MUST DO </p><p>TOGETHER ONLY THOSE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WELL TOGETHER." </p><p>HE INSISTED ON THE NEED FOR SERIOUS REFORMS.  THE EU HAS TOO </p><p>MUCH BUREAUCRACY, AND AT THE SAME TIME DOES NOT HAVE </p><p>SUFFICIENT DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OR TRANSPARENCY.  THESE </p><p>PROBLEMS NEED TO BE RESOLVED IN THE EU CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>CONVENTION. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) "I\'M A GREAT ADMIRER OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION," </p><p>CONFIDED BUTTIGLIONE.   HE CHARACTERIZED IT AS FLEXIBLE, </p><p>RESPONSIVE TO THE REAL NEEDS OF CITIZENS, UNENCUMBERED BY </p><p>PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS.   MOST IMPORTANTLY, HE ARGUED, IT HAS </p><p>SERVED THE U.S. FROM ITS EARLIEST DAYS THROUGH THE GROWTH OF </p><p>A POWERFUL FEDERAL STATE.   THE EU, HE INSISTED, NEEDS A </p><p>FLEXIBLE, RESPONSIVE AND PRACTICAL CONSTITUTION TO TAKE IT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4315 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01610  02 OF 03  291342Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXIM-01  OIGO-00  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01 </p><p>      PA-00    PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  EPAE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------7C6E66  291342Z /38 </p><p>P 291255Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 3024 </p><p>INFO ARAB LEAGUE COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CAIRO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TEL AVIV PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 001610 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EUN, PREL, ECON, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR TOUR D\'HORIZON WITH EU AFFAIRS MINISTER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01610  02 OF 03  291342Z </p><p> </p><p>FROM THE PRESENT DAY, THROUGH A EUROPE OF NATIONS TO THE </p><p>FEDERAL EUROPE THAT HE BELIEVED WOULD INEVITABLY BE CREATED </p><p>IN THE FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>THE TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE ATLANTIC COMMITMENT, SUGGESTED THE MINISTER, MUST </p><p>ALLOW US TO PARTICIPATE TOGETHER IN MAINTAINING FREEDOM AND </p><p>PEACE AND A SAFE PLACE FOR DEMOCRACIES TO EXIST.  BEFORE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11, HE ARGUED, THIS WAS NOT SO CLEAR.  BUT SINCE </p><p>SEPTEMBER 11, EUROPEANS HAVE EXPRESSED IN FAR GREATER NUMBERS </p><p>THE NEED FOR BOTH AN EU AND AN ATLANTIC COMMITMENT.   THE </p><p>EVENTS OF THAT DAY REMINDED EUROPEANS THAT THEY AND THE U.S. </p><p>SHARE A COMMON CIVILIZATION -- A COMMON CULTURAL, </p><p>JUDEO-CHRISTIAN HERITAGE.  "EVERY ITALIAN HAD EITHER BEEN TO </p><p>THE WORLD TRADE CENTER OR KNEW SOMEONE WHO HAD.  WE SAW THE </p><p>VICTIMS AS PEOPLE, NOT SYMBOLS, AND WE PARTICIPATED IN THE </p><p>GRIEF." </p><p> </p><p>EU ENLARGEMENT </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED ABOUT CANDIDATE COUNTRIES FOR </p><p>ENLARGEMENT.  WHICH WERE CERTAIN?  WHICH WERE STILL IN PLAY? </p><p>BUTTIGLIONE RESPONDED THAT ALL BUT CYPRUS AND TURKEY WERE </p><p>CERTAIN.  TURKEY WOULD NOT MAKE IT.  PROSPECTS FOR CYPRUS </p><p>WERE IMPROVING, BUT IT WAS NOT YET CERTAIN TO ENTER.  ASIDE </p><p>FROM THE GREECE-TURKEY ISSUES, CYPRUS HAD TO DO MORE AGAINST </p><p>ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01610  02 OF 03  291342Z </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) AS THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO RUSSIA, THE MINISTER </p><p>STATED THAT RUSSIA WOULD NOT BECOME A MEMBER OF THE EU IN THE </p><p>FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  HE COULD CERTAINLY SEE POSSIBILITIES OF </p><p>ASSOCIATION AND PARTNERSHIP FOR RUSSIA AND THE CIS, </p><p>STRENGTHEN.  HOWEVER, THE BOTTOM LINE WAS THAT THE EU COULD </p><p>NEVER AFFORD TO GIVE RUSSIA ACCESS TO THE GENEROUS COMMON </p><p>AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND STRUCTURAL FUNDS.  RUSSIA WOULD </p><p>BANKRUPT THE EU. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) MINISTER BUTTIGLIONE HAD MADE SOME UNHELPFUL </p><p>STATEMENTS REGARDING IRAQ, CLAIMING THAT U.S. MILITARY ACTION </p><p>AGAINST IRAQ WOULD BE INHUMANE AND SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED THE CONTEXT OF HIGH LEVEL </p><p>DISCUSSIONS ON IRAQ AMONG WORLD LEADERS, AND THAT PRIME </p><p>MINISTER BERLUSCONI WAS IN ACCORD WITH THE U.S. PRESIDENT. </p><p>EMBASSY POLMC SUGGESTED THAT THE MINISTER MIGHT FIND IT </p><p>HELPFUL TO BE BRIEFED ON IRAQ AND ITS PROGRAM TO BUILD </p><p>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, AS WELL AS THE EFFORTS THE U.S. </p><p>HAS MADE TO RESOLVE THIS.  THE MINISTER EXPRESSED INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) BUTTIGLIONE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT HIS COMMENTS IN </p><p>NO WAY INDICATED SUPPORT FOR IRAQ.  HE NOTED THAT ITALY WAS </p><p>NEAR ENOUGH TO IRAQ TO BE THREATENED WITH "NON-CONVENTIONAL </p><p>WEAPONS."  HOWEVER, HE SAW THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN SITUATION.  "IN ORDER TO CREATE A MILITARY </p><p>BUILD-UP AGAINST IRAQ, WE NEED TO CREATE A COALITION OF ARAB </p><p>STATES AS PART OF IT.  THERE IS NO WAY THEY WILL JOIN US </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01610  02 OF 03  291342Z </p><p>UNLESS WE HAVE SOLVED THE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM.  ONCE WE DO </p><p>SOLVE THE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM, SADDAM WILL SEE THAT HE HAS NO </p><p>SUPPORT, AND GIVE IN."  HE ADDED THAT ONCE THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>ISSUE WAS RESOLVED, ITALY PROPOSED A "MARSHALL PLAN" FOR THE </p><p>MID-EAST THAT WOULD STABILIZE THE REGION.  ALL THIS WOULD </p><p>LEAD TO EITHER AN OPENING FROM SADDAM OR A BREAKDOWN OF HIS </p><p>REGIME.  NO OUTSIDE FORCE WOULD BE REQUIRED. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) THE AMBASSADOR REJECTED THIS LINE OF REASONING.  HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT SADDAM HAS NO MORE INTEREST IN PALESTINE THAN </p><p>DOES OSAMA, AND REMINDED THE MINISTER THAT IRAQ HAS A PROGRAM </p><p>OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, AND THAT INSPECTORS ARE NOT </p><p>ALLOWED INTO THE COUNTRY.  HE RENEWED THE OFFER OF A BRIEFING </p><p>ON THE SITUATION, AND THE MINISTER ACCEPTED. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) COMMENT:  BUTTIGLIONE, PHILOSOPHER BY TRAINING, IS A </p><p>THOUGHTFUL COMMENTATOR WITH A DEEPLY HUMANISTIC -- AND ROMAN </p><p>CATHOLIC -- WORLD VIEW.  HIS ITALY IS GROUNDED IN EUROPEAN </p><p>GEOGRAPHY, BUT ALSO IN EUROPEAN CULTURE, RELIGION AND </p><p>HISTORY.  A LONGSTANDING CRITIC OF MILITARY ACTION AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ, HE APPARENTLY BELIEVES THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC </p><p>MEASURES CAN EFFECT CHANGES IN POLITICAL BEHAVIOR, EVEN IN </p><p>DIFFICULT CASES SUCH AS IRAN AND IRAQ.  HIS PREFERENCE FOR </p><p>DIALOGUE AND COMPROMISE OVER CONFRONTATION MAY PUT HIM </p><p>OCCASIONALLY AT ODDS WITH OUR MORE DIRECT STYLE, ALTHOUGH HE </p><p>CAN STILL BE COUNTED FIRMLY AMONG THE FRIENDS OF THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4316 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01610  03 OF 03  291342Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NEA-00   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------7C6E6A  291343Z /38 </p><p>P 291255Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 3025 </p><p>INFO ARAB LEAGUE COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY CAIRO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY TEL AVIV PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 001610 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EUN, PREL, ECON, PGOV, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR TOUR D\'HORIZON WITH EU AFFAIRS MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01610  03 OF 03  291342Z </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01610 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
