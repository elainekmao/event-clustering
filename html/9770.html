<p>UNCLAS HANOI 001933 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, VM, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT:  MFA SUGGESTS NEXT ROUND OF HR DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  In a meeting with A/DCM on July 30, MFA </p><p>International Organization Department Acting Director Pham </p><p>Binh Minh formally proposed that Vietnam host the next round </p><p>of US-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue, preferably in late </p><p>August 2003.  He suggested that Vietnam would be ready to up </p><p>the level of leadership to the Vice Ministerial level, </p><p>although he was unsure who would lead on the Vietnamese </p><p>side.  (He opined that VFM Le Van Bang might be the relevant </p><p>GVN official.)  He said that he was unsure who the U.S. </p><p>equivalent might be, but suggested an Undersecretary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  A/DCM cited Secretary Powell\'s recent letter to FM </p><p>Nien as describing growing concern over human rights </p><p>development in Vietnam and doubt over the efficacy of </p><p>dialogue.  He noted in particular that heavy prison </p><p>sentences since the 2002 dialogue on peaceful Vietnamese </p><p>activists, most recently Pham Hong Son, had been especially </p><p>disappointing and worrisome, as indicative of a negative </p><p>trend.  He urged Vietnam to take steps immediately to </p><p>improve the climate for dialogue, such as releasing peaceful </p><p>activists, providing more access to prisons and to court </p><p>proceedings, and becoming more transparent.  He expressed </p><p>appreciation for MFA IO\'s role in providing updates on some </p><p>prisoners of concern, and noted that some of this news dated </p><p>back several years; it would have been even more helpful to </p><p>receive updates at the time of the releases in several of </p><p>the cases. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (U)  Acting Director Minh responded that it was up to </p><p>the U.S. whether it wished to continue the dialogue or not; </p><p>A/DCM noted that the USG sought constructive dialogue that </p><p>led to an improvement in the human rights situation.  Minh </p><p>reiterated Vietnam\'s own commitment to human rights </p><p>dialogues, which it now conducts with the EU, Norway, and </p><p>Australia and is seeking to expand further, as well as a </p><p>desire to broaden and elevate participation.  He </p><p>specifically expressed a willingness to welcome Ambassador- </p><p>at-large for Religious Freedom Hanford to visit Vietnam in </p><p>the near future.  Responding to a question, he said that the </p><p>MFA had no plans at present to host a political dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Comment and action request:  The GVN seems to be </p><p>blocking out all of the cautionary but forceful messages on </p><p>human rights we have been sending since the last dialogue. </p><p>The MFA in particular seems to view dialogue for dialogue\'s </p><p>sake as a goal in and of itself.  In responding, it might be </p><p>advisable to provide a short list of near-term actions -- </p><p>short of releases of the most prominent activists, which we </p><p>cannot realistically expect soon -- the GVN could </p><p>conceivably undertake that would warrant continuation of the </p><p>dialogue, even at the same or lower level as in previous </p><p>years.  These could include, inter alia: </p><p>--  access by emboffs to notable prisoners of concern such </p><p>as Father Nguyen Van Ly, Pham Hong Son, Le Chi Quang, and </p><p>Nguyen Khac Toan; </p><p>--  access by emboffs to a type "A" Prison (for prisoners </p><p>serving over 20 year sentences; </p><p>--  access by emboffs, congenoffs, and international </p><p>journalists to upcoming trials of activists such as Tran Van </p><p>Que, Pham Van Duong, and Nguyen Dan Que; </p><p>--  MFA/MPS comments on previous human rights report and </p><p>international religious freedom report for corrections, </p><p>inaccuracies, etc.; </p><p>--  host visit by Ambassador Hanford; and, </p><p>--  invite Amnesty International and/or Human Rights Watch </p><p>on a fact-finding tour. </p><p>Please advise. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
