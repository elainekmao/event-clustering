HARARE 1802 </p><p>     B. HARARE 1812 </p><p>     C. HARARE 1820 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. (C) The Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ), WFP, U.S, UK, EU and </p><p>other NGOs are undertaking separate food relief efforts in </p><p>Zimbabwe.  The targets of the WFP, U.S., UK, EU and NGO </p><p>programs are the most vulnerable Zimbabweans.  We have heard </p><p>numerous reports that the GOZ distributes food to Zanu-PF </p><p>supporters, but there is no evidence that political </p><p>affiliation has influenced who gets U.S. food.  A range of </p><p>impediments, however, have hindered distribution of U.S. food </p><p>through the WFP program, including false press reports, </p><p>politicians\' media statements implying they are involved in </p><p>the NGO distribution process, and limited NGO capacity.  An </p><p>independent monitoring system is required to investigate and </p><p>prevent abuse, and we are working actively with other donors </p><p>in Harare to develop such a mechanism.  USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>coordination with OCHA and provision of funds for monitoring </p><p>are also critical.  Observers agree that even with planned </p><p>increases in the coming months, demand for food will outstrip </p><p>supply of food assistance.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Who\'s Distributing Food Here? </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) The GOZ, WFP, U.S, UK, EU and other NGOs are </p><p>undertaking separate food relief efforts in various areas of </p><p>the country.  Though we are unclear on all of the precise </p><p>sites, the GOZ is selling, exchanging for work, and handing </p><p>out maize meal through the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) </p><p>selectively in areas where it appears that Zanu-PF has done </p><p>well in recent elections.  The U.S. is currently contributing </p><p>about 40 percent of the WFP program which contracts four NGOs </p><p>for distribution: Care International (southeastern </p><p>provinces), Christian Care (north and eastern provinces), </p><p>World Vision (southwest, southeast, and northeast provinces) </p><p>and the Zimbabwean NGO ORAP (southern and western provinces). </p><p> The U.S. also has a bilateral program with World Vision (see </p><p>areas above).  The UK and EU have their own bilateral </p><p>programs.  In addition, there are other NGOs operating </p><p>independently of these efforts: Save the Children Fund UK </p><p>(western provinces), Oxfam (central provinces), Plan (eastern </p><p>provinces), and HelpAge (central provinces). </p><p> </p><p>Distribution Process and Criteria </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>3. (U) The fundamental criterion of all non-GOZ efforts is </p><p>targeting the most vulnerable Zimbabweans.  NGOs work with </p><p>local government officials (councilors etc.) traditional </p><p>leaders, church groups, and local NGOs to identify recipients </p><p>and reach a consensus list of beneficiaries.  Some basic </p><p>criteria are: lack of livestock, lack of income, single </p><p>mothers, non-working parents, orphans, HIV affected, elderly, </p><p>chronically ill, and disabled.  Once a list is developed, it </p><p>is discussed at a town meeting where any local resident can </p><p>comment, or appeal his case for inclusion.  Stocks may run </p><p>out before all eligible people are served, and the </p><p>identification process is subject to error or abuse, but it </p><p>is community based, and incorporates checks and balances that </p><p>allow for reconsideration and appeal. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Food </p><p>--------- </p><p>4. (C) There have been numerous reports in the local press, </p><p>and some Embassy election observers witnessed first hand the </p><p>Grain Marketing Board (GMB) distributing food primarily or </p><p>entirely to ruling party supporters.  However, there is no </p><p>evidence that political affiliation has influenced who gets </p><p>U.S.-donated food.  There is, furthermore, no indication that </p><p>so-called war vets have taken over feeding sites, or </p><p>padlocked any warehouses with U.S. food, or hijacked trucks </p><p>carrying U.S. food.  However, food assistance is becoming a </p><p>significant element in a rhetorical tug-of-war between </p><p>Zanu-PF and the MDC, which hampers the ability of contracting </p><p>NGOs to distribute U.S. food, and occasionally has delayed </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p>Political Rhetoric and the Impact on Food Distribution </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>5. (U) On August 6, Poloff met with Reverend Matonga, </p><p>Director of Christian Care in Zimbabwe, to discuss a recent </p><p>press report that war vets had skewed the list of Christian </p><p>Care food recipients in Muzarabani (Mashonaland Central </p><p>province) in favor of Zanu-PF supporters.  Christian Care </p><p>distributed 48 metric tons of WFP food in Muzarabani in July. </p><p> According to Matonga, the story was a complete fabrication </p><p>by the MDC, and he has been trying unsuccessfully to get a </p><p>meeting with MDC officials to set the record straight. </p><p>Christian Care has not had any difficulties with Zanu-PF </p><p>supporters since February 2000 when two of its employees were </p><p>beaten by war vets.  The organization subsequently received </p><p>an apology from the provincial governor. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Political statements from officials of both political </p><p>parties--although ZANU-PF is the worst culprit--illustrate </p><p>the charged environment in which food distribution is taking </p><p>place, and how politicians from both sides have fueled </p><p>allegations of politicization.  In May, for instance, the </p><p>Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, and MP Abednico Ncube </p><p>reportedly told villagers in Gwanda that "everyone will </p><p>receive food".  World Vision halted their Gwanda program, and </p><p>was forced to re-explain the beneficiary criteria to excluded </p><p>angry villagers who thought they would receive food.  Ncube </p><p>subsequently corrected that statement publicly, but told </p><p>villagers in Matabeleland in July that maize "will be </p><p>available only to those who dump the opposition and work with </p><p>ZANU-PF", and the party would "start feeding its children </p><p>before turning to those of the MDC".  On July 20, ZANU-PF MP </p><p>for Beitbridge, Kembo Mohadi, warned NGOs distributing food </p><p>in Gwanda that they would have to follow government </p><p>directives, and their equipment would soon be taken over by </p><p>local GOZ officials.  In an August 2 BBC article, Didymus </p><p>Mutasa, ZANU-PF Secretary for External Relations, complained </p><p>that Western influence comes along with donor food </p><p>distribution, and suggested that any food aid should be </p><p>distributed through government mechanisms.  See Ref. B for </p><p>further official objections to NGO food distribution. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) On August 6, under the headline, "Food Aid Prolongs </p><p>Nation\'s Suffering", the independent "Financial Gazette" </p><p>commented that food aid is perpetuating and prolonging deeper </p><p>suffering by giving Zimbabweans a false sense of food </p><p>security when instead they should be confronting the </p><p>political causes of their starvation. </p><p> </p><p>Straining NGO Resources </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>8. (C) Rudo Kwaramba, World Vision Country Director, has been </p><p>occupied with responding to questions from the international </p><p>community, setting the record straight in the local media </p><p>with interviews and press briefings, and persuading offending </p><p>politicians to correct their statements, all of which takes </p><p>time away from actually feeding the hungry.  WFP Director </p><p>Kevin Farrell also complained that checking every instance of </p><p>abuse is consuming a significant percentage of their time. </p><p> </p><p>Monitoring Mechanism </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>9. (C) USAID, the UK\'s DFID, EU and WFP agree that an </p><p>independent monitoring mechanism is required to investigate </p><p>and prevent abuse.  We understand that USAID/DCHA/OFDA in </p><p>Washington is pursuing, with the UN, the establishment of a </p><p>permanent OCHA presence here to handle this task.  The USAID </p><p>Mission here is working with other donors to develop a </p><p>strategy and mechanism for establishing such an independent </p><p>monitoring mechanism, in conjunction with local NGOs. </p><p>FOSENET, a consortium of local NGOs, has already initiated a </p><p>preliminary aid monitoring network with funding from several </p><p>donors. </p><p> </p><p>Ramp-Up - Bottlenecks? </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>10. (U) In conjunction with the new expanded consolidated </p><p>appeals, the WFP is in the process of expanding its program </p><p>coverage and partner NGOs.  WFP\'s plan is to increase its </p><p>food distribution from its current level of about 10,000 </p><p>metric tons per month, to 50,000 metric tons per month by </p><p>December 2002.  The national consumption is 135,000 to </p><p>150,000 metric tons per month.  According to Kevin Farrell, </p><p>WFP is working to designate more NGOs and registering them </p><p>with the GOZ, and ramping-up the capacities of the NGOs </p><p>currently registered.  Farrell believes currently registered </p><p>NGOs are reluctant to increase their staffs and logistics in </p><p>advance of the food actually arriving in country. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Under the enhanced WFP program, World Vision is </p><p>supposed to increase distribution to 12,186 metric tons a </p><p>month by December 2002.  However, World Vision finds the </p><p>terms of the WFP program difficult.  According to Kwaramba, </p><p>they receive a fixed fee of US$24,000 per month, and a </p><p>variable fee US$39.00 per ton distributed.  Submitting </p><p>invoices to get reimbursed for the variable fee takes time, </p><p>thus they are cash strapped at the same moment when they are </p><p>trying to scale-up their operations.  Also, their agreement </p><p>with WFP was to distribute 2,600 metric tons of food for the </p><p>month of July.  But WFP only delivered 2,100 metric tons. </p><p>Thus World Vision laid out the logistical costs to distribute </p><p>2,600 metric tons--but will only be paid for their actual </p><p>distribution of 2,100.  Additionally, WFP is proposing terms </p><p>for the enhanced program that would be even worse from the </p><p>World Vision perspective: an advance with most of the payment </p><p>by variable fee, and no fixed fee.  World Vision finds the </p><p>terms of the USAID bilateral program much easier--USAID hands </p><p>over the food and the money to distribute it at the outset. </p><p> </p><p>Severity of the Crisis </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>12. (C) Jean-Claude Mukadi, World Vision Relief Manager, </p><p>thinks that even the planned increase in supply of relief </p><p>food will not meet demand.  That is, if WFP were able to </p><p>ramp-up to 50,000 metric tons a month by the end of the year, </p><p>and the GMB distributes what they have in stock and in the </p><p>pipeline, and the smaller NGO and other programs continue or </p><p>are increased as planned--still there will not be enough. </p><p>The already high numbers of people suffering from </p><p>malnutrition are increasing daily, in one month, people will </p><p>be much worse Mukadi cautioned. (Note: We do not yet have </p><p>concrete malnutrition rates.  End Note.)  Ref. A also </p><p>predicts a shortfall. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>13. (C) The good news is that the barriers to GMO food </p><p>donations are coming down, (Ref. C), and the beneficiary </p><p>identification process and criteria are mostly transparent. </p><p>In addition, outright handing over of food along political </p><p>lines seems confined to the GOZ\'s own distribution programs. </p><p>An independent monitoring agency would undoubtedly contribute </p><p>to more equitable distribution, and we will continue to press </p><p>this issue actively.  However, the crisis is worsening, </p><p>putting strain on NGOs to increase capacity.  At the same </p><p>time responding to increased political rhetoric is also </p><p>straining limited NGO resources, necessarily taking time away </p><p>from actual food distribution.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
