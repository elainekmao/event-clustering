(SBU) SUMMARY.  Vietnam has strived to maintain good </p><p>ties with a number of the world\'s most troubling states, </p><p>including Cuba, Iraq, North Korea (DPRK), Iran, Libya, </p><p>Sudan, and Syria.  With the exception of Sudan and Syria, </p><p>all have embassies in Hanoi.  These relations are largely an </p><p>outgrowth of the material, financial, political, and moral </p><p>support given to Vietnam during the War years.  Apart from </p><p>trade with Iraq, most of the countries offer little, if any, </p><p>value economically to Vietnam.  Politically, these countries </p><p>also contribute little as Vietnam continues its push toward </p><p>the mainstream of the international diplomatic community. </p><p>The state media and GVN officials nonetheless continue a </p><p>drumbeat of support and undertake regular high-level </p><p>official visits with most of these diplomatic partners.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>FRIENDS WITH ALL </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  In accordance with a policy adopted in 1991 at </p><p>the Seventh Party Congress, Vietnam has moved steadily to </p><p>conduct a foreign policy that has at its core the goal of </p><p>establishing and maintaining good diplomatic and economic </p><p>relations with every nation.  In summing up 2002, Foreign </p><p>Minister Nguyen Dy Nien reaffirmed that "Vietnam is prepared </p><p>to be a friend and reliable partner of all countries in the </p><p>international community."  In perhaps one of the more </p><p>interesting examples of this track, Vietnam maintains </p><p>cordial diplomatic relations with Israel (which maintains a </p><p>small embassy in Hanoi) while showing great sympathy and </p><p>respect towards Yasser Arafat (who has visited Vietnam many </p><p>times) and the Palestine Authority, whose ambassador is the </p><p>dean of the Hanoi diplomatic corps and has served here </p><p>nearly 20 years (ref A). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>USG CONCERNS DO NOT IMPACT GVN FOREIGN POLICY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  According to Doan Ngoc Boi, Deputy Director </p><p>General of the MFA\'s West Asia and Africa Department (the </p><p>MFA section that covers most of the Middle Eastern countries </p><p>of concern), the MFA leadership understands the USG\'s views </p><p>about what are variously called "states of concern" and </p><p>"rogue states," but the MFA is charged with carrying out the </p><p>GVN\'s policy of maintaining good diplomatic relations "with </p><p>as many countries as possible."  Vietnam is "generally </p><p>sympathetic" to the US-led war on terrorism, but "this does </p><p>not affect our relations with traditional friends -- these </p><p>days, we have no enemies," he added. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>CUBA - "BROTHERLY" RELATIONSHIP </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Cuba and Vietnam have a close and long-standing </p><p>relationship and claim to share a kindred revolutionary </p><p>spirit.  Exemplifying Cuba\'s importance to Vietnam, Prime </p><p>Minister Pham Van Khai visited in October 2002.  In 2001, </p><p>Foreign Minister Nien and then-Vice President Binh also </p><p>visited.  Cuban President Castro has come to Vietnam twice, </p><p>in 1973 and 1995, and other high-level visits have occurred </p><p>at a regular pace.  Tran Thanh Huan, senior expert in the </p><p>MFA\'s Latin America section, predicted that Communist Party </p><p>of Vietnam General Secretary Nong Duc Manh might visit Cuba </p><p>during 2003.  In addition, Vietnam expects a reciprocal </p><p>visit from Cuba\'s foreign minister.  However, no dates have </p><p>been set for either visit, he added. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  In a briefing to the diplomatic community </p><p>following the Prime Minister\'s visit, MFA Assistant Foreign </p><p>Minister (AFM) Nguyen Duc Hung described the Cuba - Vietnam </p><p>relationship as "traditional, long-standing, and brotherly." </p><p>In addition, AFM Hung said that the two countries "continue </p><p>to look for ways to help each other."  AFM Hung explained </p><p>that Cuba has assisted Vietnam in the areas of medicine, </p><p>medical training, and Spanish language programs.  During the </p><p>Prime Minister\'s visit, Vietnam agreed to sell additional </p><p>rice to Cuba, AFM Hung noted.  In 2002, Vietnam exported </p><p>125,000 tons of rice to Cuba; the total volume for 2003 is </p><p>expected to rise to 150,000 tons, according to a press </p><p>report.  Another press report claimed that the rice will be </p><p>sold on "easy payment terms."  AFM Hung confirmed to poloff </p><p>on the margins of the briefing that Cuba would pay for the </p><p>rice with "hard currency." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The MFA\'s Huan separately noted that the GVN is </p><p>"paying more attention to developing the bilateral economic </p><p>potential."  In addition to rice, Huan said Vietnam would </p><p>like to export tea, footwear, and textiles to Cuba.  Vietnam </p><p>"will never forget" the help Cuba provided during Vietnam\'s </p><p>"revolutionary struggle," including hospitals, roads, and </p><p>other materiel support.  Two-way trade, however, remains </p><p>modest, at about USD 50 million per year.  Huan predicted </p><p>that if the USG were to lift the sanctions on Cuba, trade </p><p>would improve "substantially."  He said that Vietnam is </p><p>"totally against" sanctions and that "only the U.S." views </p><p>Cuba as a "rogue state."  There is no evidence that Cuba </p><p>possesses or is attempting to acquire nuclear or chemical </p><p>weapons, Huan added.  The head of the Vietnam-Cuba </p><p>Friendship Association on January 29 said that Vietnam </p><p>"strongly condemns the US outdated embargo against Cuba and </p><p>demands an immediate end." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>IRAQ:  OLD FRIEND, STRONG ECONOMIC TIES </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Unique in its relations with the various </p><p>countries of concern, Vietnam has a significant trade </p><p>relationship with Iraq.  The MFA\'s Boi said that in 2001 two- </p><p>way trade was about USD 750 million.  While final figures </p><p>for 2002 have not yet been compiled, he added that  two-way </p><p>trade may have reached USD one billion.  Boi reiterated that </p><p>all two-way trade activity is "within the UN framework."  He </p><p>admitted that Vietnam still owes Iraq about USD 100 million </p><p>from the Vietnam War-era.  He said that Vietnam would like </p><p>to increase humanitarian aid as a way to pay the debt, but </p><p>is hampered by the UN resolutions.  According to an Egyptian </p><p>emboff, the "strong relations" between the two countries </p><p>make it "unlikely" Iraq would ever attempt to collect on </p><p>this debt.  The Egyptian emboff added that Saddam Hussein </p><p>felt a "special warmth" toward Vietnam since Vietnamese </p><p>doctors helped his son recover from a near fatal automobile </p><p>accident several years ago. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  While the GVN "agrees" that Iraq should carry out </p><p>the appropriate UN resolutions, Boi reiterated that the GVN </p><p>opposes any military action against Iraq and "fully </p><p>supports" the "sovereignty and territorial integrity" of </p><p>Iraq.  In addition, the GVN has stated "on many occasions" </p><p>that internal issues "should be decided only by the Iraqi </p><p>people."  A US attack on Iraq "would also not be helpful" to </p><p>the US-Vietnam relationship, he predicted. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>DPRK:  RELATIONS ON THE UPSWING </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)   Vietnam\'s relations with the DPRK have seen </p><p>several ups and downs in recent years.  Pham Tien Van, </p><p>Deputy Director for MFA\'s Asia I bureau, noted that Vietnam </p><p>and the DPRK have "traditional ties" dating back to the </p><p>1950s.  Van described the bilateral relationship as </p><p>"excellent" from that era through the Vietnam War.  He added </p><p>that Vietnam remained "very grateful" for the moral and </p><p>materiel support the DPRK had provided.  In the years </p><p>following the war, relations were strained, according to </p><p>Van, because of Vietnam\'s actions in Cambodia.  At the time, </p><p>the DPRK sided with the PRC in opposing Vietnam\'s occupation </p><p>of Cambodia.  Relations took a further nosedive in 1992 when </p><p>Vietnam, as part of its policy of reaching out to the world </p><p>community, established diplomatic relations with the </p><p>Republic of Korea (ROK).  Ngo Xuan Binh, Director for the </p><p>Center for Korean Studies, noted that the DPRK subsequently </p><p>had made some "tentative overtures" to some western </p><p>countries and had "slowly become a little less isolated." </p><p>In that respect, Binh opined that perhaps the DPRK had been </p><p>influenced by Vietnam\'s own expanding foreign policy. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Illustrating the bilateral relationship\'s upward </p><p>trend, recent activity has included: (1) the reconvening of </p><p>the Joint Economic Committee in October 1991 for the first </p><p>time since Vietnam established diplomatic relations with the </p><p>ROK in 1992; (2) a visit by GVN President Tran Duc Luong in </p><p>May 2002 (ref C); and (3) other bilateral exchanges, such as </p><p>the visit to Vietnam by the Chairman of the DPRK National </p><p>Assembly in 2001 and the visit to the DPRK in October 2002 </p><p>by General Le Van Dung, Director of the General Political </p><p>Department of the People\'s Army of Vietnam.  Binh emphasized </p><p>that "Vietnam\'s relations with the DPRK are strong and </p><p>should continue to improve." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  The Korean Studies Center\'s Binh separately </p><p>opined that the recent increase in bilateral activity </p><p>stemmed from  DPRK recognition of the success Vietnam had </p><p>achieved with its market reforms.  Binh admitted, however, </p><p>that "it is very hard to know what they think."  Binh also </p><p>lamented that the DPRK\'s economy is in "such bad shape that </p><p>it has little, if anything to offer" in terms of trade. </p><p>Thus, the potential for two-way trade, currently at a "very </p><p>low level" is "not good," even under barter arrangements, he </p><p>predicted.  The MFA\'s Van said that Vietnam would continue </p><p>to assist the DPRK, noting that in 2002, Vietnam had donated </p><p>5,000 tons of rice.  Van added that, given the DPRK\'s dire </p><p>financial situation, it was "unlikely" that Vietnam would </p><p>collect on the USD 10 million debt the DPRK owed Vietnam </p><p>from a 1996 rice "sale." </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  Van noted that "more stability" on the Korean </p><p>Peninsula would also have a positive impact on Vietnam\'s </p><p>relations with both the DPRK and the ROK.  He added that </p><p>Vietnam wanted to see the region "nuclear-free."  A January </p><p>10 statement by the MFA further stated that Vietnam hoped </p><p>all parties would "exercise restraint" and engage in </p><p>dialogue that will result in "peace, stability, and a </p><p>nuclear-free status."  Van admitted, however, that Vietnam </p><p>was not "well placed" for an active mediation role in the </p><p>Korean Peninsula, while admitting that, during his visit to </p><p>the DPRK, President Luong had passed a message to his hosts </p><p>from the ROK leadership. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>IRAN:  TRADITIONAL FRIENDSHIP </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  From Vietnam\'s perspective, Iran remains one of </p><p>its trusted and traditional friends.  The MFA\'s Boi </p><p>described the bilateral political relationship as </p><p>"excellent," noting that "we have many common views and </p><p>interests, including a peaceful solution to the Iraq </p><p>crisis."  Boi added that Iran had even made overtures about </p><p>becoming a "dialogue partner" with ASEAN (ref E). </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  In 1995, Vietnam\'s president visited Iran, while </p><p>in 1996 Iran\'s president visited Vietnam.  Nong Duc Manh, </p><p>then-chairman of the National Assembly and now General </p><p>Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, visited Iran in </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>1999.  More recently, President Luong visited in October </p><p>2002 and, with his hosts, signed several agreements on </p><p>economic, technical, and cultural cooperation.  President </p><p>Luong invited the Iranian president to make a return visit, </p><p>but Boi declined to predict when such a visit will take </p><p>place. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  Economic activity lags behind the political </p><p>relationship.  Boi lamented that, despite "great economic </p><p>potential," two-way trade is running at only about USD 40 </p><p>million.  Boi suggested that the main factors inhibiting a </p><p>stronger economic relationship are: (1) Iran has established </p><p>stronger links with other countries that export products </p><p>similar to Vietnam (e.g. rice and textiles); and (2) Iranian </p><p>and Vietnamese businessmen "do not understand" each other </p><p>well.  Boi opined that a deterioration in the Iraq situation </p><p>could have a positive impact on the Vietnam - Iran economic </p><p>relationship, because if Vietnamese businessmen "lose" the </p><p>Iraq market, they will make stronger efforts to penetrate </p><p>the Iran market. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>LIBYA:  FRIENDLY, BUT NOT QUITE TRADITIONAL </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU)  The MFA\'s Boi described relations with Libya as </p><p>"good to normal."  While the two countries have diplomatic </p><p>missions in each other\'s capitals, there is "not much" </p><p>bilateral activity.  Boi said that Vietnam is "grateful" to </p><p>Libya for the political and economic support provided during </p><p>the Vietnam War and that the two countries share a </p><p>"revolutionary background."  Boi added that Vietnam also </p><p>watches carefully over the welfare of approximately 3,000 </p><p>Vietnamese contract workers in Libya employed by a Korean </p><p>company for a large irrigation project.  Two-way trade is </p><p>"under USD 10 million" and unlikely to increase more than </p><p>incrementally in the foreseeable future, Boi predicted. </p><p>Factors inhibiting the development of increased economic </p><p>relations, according to Boi, include: (1) a small market; </p><p>(2) strong competition from the PRC; (3) distance; and (4) a </p><p>harsh climate. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU)  A December 2002 visit by a Libyan parliamentary </p><p>delegation received significant coverage in Vietnam\'s state- </p><p>controlled media.  Foreign Minister Nien told his Libyan </p><p>guests that their visit "demonstrated Libya\'s desire to </p><p>strengthen ties with Vietnam."   Deputy Prime Minister Vu </p><p>Khoan urged both countries to work hard so that economic </p><p>ties could "reach their potential," according to a press </p><p>report.  Boi noted, however, that no other major visits are </p><p>planned over the next year. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>SUDAN AND SYRIA:  MOSTLY BELOW THE GVN\'S RADAR SCREEN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>18 (SBU)  According to the MFA\'s Boi, the offshore </p><p>ambassadors of Sudan and Syria (in Jakarta and Beijing, </p><p>respectively) have only ever visited Hanoi to present their </p><p>credentials.  An Egyptian emboff said that the Sudanese </p><p>ambassador had expressed little interest in advancing </p><p>Vietnam - Sudan relations during his December 2002 visit. </p><p>Assistant Foreign Minister Nguyen Phu Binh visited Sudan in </p><p>2001, during a trip that also included Tanzania and Angola. </p><p>Two-way trade between the two countries is "maybe USD one </p><p>million," Boi estimated.  Boi added that the one area for </p><p>potential cooperation is in agriculture.  Vietnam plans to </p><p>send agricultural experts to Sudan to help improve rice- </p><p>growing techniques in 2003.  Boi commented that Vietnam was </p><p>"grateful" to Sudan for the "political and moral" support </p><p>during the Vietnam War.  While the relationship is "not </p><p>especially close," Vietnam also sees Sudan as an important </p><p>part of its strategy to strengthen overall relations with </p><p>Africa. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU)  Tran Viet Tu, MFA Asia II expert, called </p><p>Vietnam\'s  bilateral relationship with Syria  "truly quiet." </p><p>Tu said that, while Syria had supported Vietnam during the </p><p>war years, the relationship had not significantly "moved </p><p>forward from there."  Tu said that in an effort to move the </p><p>relationship forward, then-GVN President Le Duc Anh visited </p><p>Syria in 1995, but there has never been a reciprocal visit. </p><p>Tu added that no visits are planned for 2003.  Tu suggested </p><p>that Syria had been "very much preoccupied" with Israel, and </p><p>has "never given much thought" to Vietnam since the end of </p><p>the Vietnam War.  Concerning trade, Tu said that the two-way </p><p>trade is "too low to estimate."  Vietnam does not view that </p><p>Syria is a state sponsor of terrorism, Tu claimed. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>20.  (SBU)  The key to understanding Vietnam\'s ongoing </p><p>relations with the world\'s "bad guys" is what a senior MFA </p><p>official called Vietnam\'s "sense of history."  The common </p><p>thread in bilateral relations with these countries is the </p><p>political, moral, and sometimes material and financial </p><p>support they gave to Vietnam during the war.   Vietnam will </p><p>continue to maintain good relations with these countries, </p><p>while at the same time seeking to become more involved in </p><p>the mainstream multilateral and regional environment.  GVN </p><p>senior leaders do not see a conflict in improving and </p><p>enhancing relationships with the U.S., western Europe, and </p><p>other countries while at the same time keeping up ties with </p><p>and voicing support for "old friends." </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
