<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 002394 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/SA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/15/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS\' TOP IDEOLOGUE BHATTARAI </p><p>BACK-PEDALS ON THREATS TO AMERICANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 2171 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  In a December 14 interview with the </p><p>Washington Times, Maoist ideologue Baburam Bhattarai appeared </p><p>to back-pedal from the implicit threat against American </p><p>diplomats conveyed in a November 15 communique issued by a </p><p>regional commander.  While it is always difficult to assess </p><p>the sincerity of Maoist statements--especially those conveyed </p><p>via Western media--Baburam\'s softer tone may reflect an </p><p>attempt by the insurgents to ward off a possible terrorist </p><p>designation by the USG.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  On December 14 the Washington Times website </p><p>carried the text of a December 7 e-mail interview by Chitra </p><p>Tiwari, a former Embassy FSN described in the byline as a </p><p>"Washington-based analyst of international affairs," and </p><p>Maoist ideologue Baburam Bhattarai.  (Note:  Tiwari recently </p><p>has acted as an apologist for Nepal\'s Maoists.  End note.) </p><p>In the interview, Bhattarai asserted that the six-year-old </p><p>insurgency "is now peaking toward a climax . . . and a </p><p>situation of strategic stalemate has developed in the overall </p><p>sense."  While preferring to resolve the conflict </p><p>"internally," Bhattarai stated that the Maoists "would not </p><p>mind facilitation or mediation of some genuinely neutral </p><p>international organizations" under certain conditions. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Nepal\'s "friends in the West should realize" that </p><p>true constitutional monarchy is not possible in the country, </p><p>Bhattarai claimed, and support the Maoists\' bid to establish </p><p>a "democratic republic"--not a communist republic--via </p><p>elections to a constituent assembly.  Discounting any </p><p>ideological or other ties to the Khmer Rouge, Bhattarai </p><p>alleged that the Maoists have "already resolved to discard </p><p>some of the negative and harmful experiences of the </p><p>international communist movement," claiming that the </p><p>insurgents are engaged in "a united fight with parliamentary </p><p>democratic forces against the feudal, autocratic monarchy . . </p><p>."  When confronted with frequent comparisons of Maoist </p><p>tactics with those of Cambodia\'s Khmer Rouge, Bhattarai </p><p>denied such comparisons and questioned the validity of the </p><p>many claims of gross human rights violations committed by Pol </p><p>Pot\'s Khmer Rouge. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Bhattarai denied that Maoists have extorted money </p><p>from foreign tourists in Nepal, asserting "It is just </p><p>impossible that our highly motivated and disciplined cadres </p><p>would commit such heinous crimes. . . .Foreign tourists are </p><p>completely safe in our areas, and will be so in future." </p><p>Nonetheless, he warned tourists not to patronize "big hotels </p><p>and so-called Nature Conservation Areas (which) are mostly </p><p>controlled by the ruling Shah-Rana families," and </p><p>acknowledged "some hazards of getting caught in the crossfire </p><p>in a situation of raging civil war." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) "U.S. government employees and American citizens--for </p><p>that matter all foreign employees and citizens--are </p><p>completely safe in Nepal," Bhattarai continued.  He parroted </p><p>the party line, first seen in the November 15 communique from </p><p>the Kathmandu Valley commander claiming responsibility for </p><p>the killings of two Embassy security guards (Reftel), that </p><p>the Maoists "have no policy of harming or attacking any </p><p>foreign national unless they are found working against the </p><p>revolutionary movement."  With respect to the assassinations </p><p>of the two guards, "the party has reviewed the cases and </p><p>resolved that henceforth, if any such charges are leveled </p><p>against any such employee, the concerned embassy would be </p><p>advised before action is taken.  However, we would caution </p><p>the enlightened American people to beware of the xenophobic </p><p>propaganda of the U.S. government to hide its nefarious </p><p>agenda." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment:  Since so many of the statements in the </p><p>interview, including the denial that Maoists extort money </p><p>from foreign tourists; the claim that the Maoists do not seek </p><p>a one-party Communist state; and the oblique defense of Pol </p><p>Pot, are patently false, it is difficult to have full </p><p>confidence in Bhattarai\'s pledge that the Maoists will </p><p>henceforth notify us before executing any of our employees. </p><p>It is clear, however, that the Maoists dislike being tagged </p><p>as terrorists (the Maoist student union has demanded the </p><p>government lift the terrorist label from their organization </p><p>as a condition for ending the current educational strike), </p><p>and are anxious to avoid the sanctions and international </p><p>opprobrium that would come with such a designation by the </p><p>USG.  Bhattarai\'s statements may reflect an effort, at least </p><p>by the Maoist leadership, to mollify the USG and avert such a </p><p>designation.  If his intent is to signal a lessened threat to </p><p>our Mission personnel and the American community, we welcome </p><p>it. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
