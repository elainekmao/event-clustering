<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ROME 001962 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NP/RA, EUR/PRA, EUR/RUS, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, EU, ETRD, EU, IT, WTO, ITPREL, WTO </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY WON\'T FORCE IRAN WTO ACCESSION ISSUE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01962  01 OF 02  191836Z </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 71421 (B) ROME 1355 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY ECOUNS KAREN MILLIKEN; REASON 1.5 B/D. </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT.  ITALY STRONGLY DISAGREES WITH </p><p>USG POLICY ON IRAN\'S POTENTIAL ACCESSION TO THE WORLD TRADE </p><p>ORGANIZATION BUT DOES NOT INTEND TO PUSH THE EU TO FORCE THE </p><p>ISSUE AT THE MAY 13 WTO GENERAL COUNCIL MEETING OR </p><p>THEREAFTER, ACCORDING TO MFA\'S WTO COORDINATOR.  ALTHOUGH THE </p><p>ITALIANS WILL NOT MAKE AN ISSUE OF IRAN\'S WTO AMBITIONS, </p><p>NEITHER CAN WE EXPECT THEM TO CARRY REF A\'S SUGGESTED MESSAGE </p><p>TYING CLOSER ECONOMIC TIES TO IMPROVED PERFORMANCE ON THE </p><p>LISTED ISSUES.  ON THE CONTRARY, WE CAN COUNT ON THEM TO </p><p>COMMISERATE WITH THE IRANIANS ABOUT PERCEIVED USG OBSTINACY </p><p>ON WTO AS BENEFITING CONSERVATIVES AT THE EXPENSE OF </p><p>REFORMERS.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ITALY ACCEPTS REF A\'S STRAIGHTFORWARD MESSAGE THAT WE </p><p>ARE NOT OPEN TO DISCUSSION OF IRANIAN ACCESSION TO THE WTO </p><p>AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ITALY SEES THE MATTER AS A NON-ISSUE FOR </p><p>THE MAY 13 WTO GENERAL COUNCIL MEETING, MAURIZIO ZANINI, </p><p>MFA\'S WTO COORDINATOR, TOLD ECONOFF ON APRIL 17.  ECONOFF </p><p>ASKED WHETHER ITALY, LONG A FACILITATOR OF IRAN\'S CONTACTS </p><p>WITH THE WEST, WOULD PRESS THE EU TO SPONSOR IRAN IN GENEVA. </p><p>ZANINI REPLIED THAT ITALY PICKS VERY CAREFULLY THE ISSUES ON </p><p>WHICH IT LOOKS TO LEAD THE EU AND, IN THE TRADE AREA, ITALY\'S </p><p>SINGLE PROACTIVE ISSUE IS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION </p><p>FOR GEOGRAPHICALLY DESIGNATED PRODUCTS.  HE SAID ITALY WILL </p><p>NOT SPEND ITS WTO CAPITAL IN THE EU ON IRANIAN ACCESSION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ALTHOUGH CONCEDING THE ESSENTIAL POINT OF OUR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01962  01 OF 02  191836Z </p><p>DEMARCHE, ZANINI LAMBASTED THE USG POSITION.  HE WANTED TO BE </p><p>SURE THE USG UNDERSTANDS THAT SUCCESS IN BLOCKING CONSENSUS </p><p>ON AN ACCESSION PROCESS FOR IRAN IS NOT TANTAMOUNT TO ITALY </p><p>OR THE EU ADOPTING WHAT HE SEES AS MISGUIDED U.S. POLICY.  HE </p><p>SAID ITALY, ON THE CONTRARY, "SUPPORTS EVERYONE FOR WTO </p><p>ACCESSION.  THE WTO\'S MOST COMPELLING ASPECT IS ITS </p><p>INCLUSIVENESS.  WHEN THE ISRAELIS SPEAK, FOR EXAMPLE, THE </p><p>ARABS DON\'T WALK OUT."  THE U.S., HE INSISTED, IS ASKING THE </p><p>WRONG QUESTION.  FOR ZANINI, THE QUESTION ISN\'T WHETHER </p><p>IRAN\'S POLITICAL CONDUCT WARRANTS WTO MEMBERSHIP BUT WHETHER </p><p>THE WORLD IS BETTER OFF WITH IRAN, NOTWITHSTANDING ITS </p><p>POLITICS, SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE RULES.  HE BELIEVES </p><p>IRAN\'S EVENTUAL WTO MEMBERSHIP WOULD HELP STABILIZE THE WORLD </p><p>TRADING SYSTEM AND, ESPECIALLY GIVEN MAJOR ITALIAN </p><p>INVESTMENTS IN IRAN, HE WOULD LOOK NO FURTHER FOR </p><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR LAUNCHING AN ACCESSION PROCESS.  IF THE USG </p><p>WANTS TO LOOK FURTHER, HE SUGGESTED, WE MIGHT CONSIDER </p><p>WHETHER ENHANCED STABILITY IN THE TRADING SYSTEM MIGHT NOT </p><p>FOSTER ENHANCED POLITICAL STABILITY AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ECHOING COMMENTS MADE BY MFA ACTING GULF STATES OFFICE </p><p>DIRECTOR EMANUELE FARRUGGIA TO POLOFF AND ECONOFF, ALSO ON </p><p>APRIL 17, ZANINI SAID THE DISCUSSION OF WTO ACCESSION FOR </p><p>IRAN IS, IN ANY EVENT, LARGELY SYMBOLIC.  MFA SEES THE </p><p>IRANIAN ECONOMY AS YEARS AWAY FROM A SERIOUS WTO RUN AND </p><p>FALLING EVEN FURTHER BEHIND AS WITNESSED BY IRAN\'S RECENT </p><p>FAILURE TO ENACT EVEN RUDIMENTARY FOREIGN INVESTMENT </p><p>INCENTIVES (SEE ALSO REF B).  NOTING THAT OUR DEMARCHE MAKES </p><p>NO MENTION OF THE OBVIOUS ECONOMIC BASIS FOR DENYING IRAN WTO </p><p>ACCESSION, FARRUGGIA SAID ITALY IS PRESSING IRAN HARD FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01962  01 OF 02  191836Z </p><p>BOTH ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REFORM BUT DOES NOT SEE ONE </p><p>EFFORT AS LEVERAGING THE OTHER. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) IN RESPONSE, EMBOFFS PRESENTED REF A POINTS, </p><p>EMPHASIZING THAT A LINKAGE BETWEEN CESSATION OF IRAN\'S </p><p>OBJECTIONABLE BEHAVIOR AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION COULD GIVE </p><p>IRANIAN REFORMERS BOTH A MEANS AND A MOTIVE TO AFFECT THE </p><p>BEHAVIOR OF CONSERVATIVES.  ECONOMIC COOPERATION UNLINKED TO </p><p>POLITICAL BEHAVIOR, WE CONTINUED, COULD LEAVE CONSERVATIVES </p><p>CONVINCED THAT IRAN\'S POLITICAL CONDUCT WAS OF NO CONCERN TO </p><p>WESTERN ECONOMIES.  FARRUGGIA ARGUED THE OPPOSITE POINT -- </p><p>THAT WITHHOLDING ECONOMIC COOPERATION WOULD BOLSTER THE </p><p>CONSERVATIVES\' CONTENTION THAT IRANIAN RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE </p><p>WEST IS ONE-SIDED. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) FARRUGGIA COMMENTED ON TWO OF REF A\'S POINTS IN </p><p>PARTICULAR -- IRAN\'S EVIDENT NUCLEAR AMBITIONS AND ITS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR VIOLENT OPPOSITION TO THE MEPP.  HE SAID IRAN HAS </p><p>SEEN A NUCLEAR WEAPON CAPACITY AS AN ESSENTIAL NATIONAL </p><p>INTEREST EVER SINCE THE SHAH\'S REGIME.  HE FEELS THAT ANY </p><p>EFFORT, THROUGH THE NONPROLIFERATION TREATY OR OTHERWISE, TO </p><p>DISSUADE IRAN FROM PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS MUST TAKE INTO </p><p>ACCOUNT THE VISCERAL PLACE THESE WEAPONS OCCUPY IN THE </p><p>IRANIAN NATIONAL PSYCHE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, HIS FREQUENT </p><p>CONTACTS WITH IRANIAN OFFICIALS HAS NOT LEFT HIM WITH A SENSE </p><p>THAT SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN NATIONALISM IS SIMILARLY CENTRAL </p><p>TO THEM. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2716 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01962  02 OF 02  191836Z </p><p>ACTION NP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AIT-03   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  CTME-00  INL-00   DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   MOFM-05 </p><p>      MOF-01   AC-01    NEA-00   DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-01 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  SA-00    EPAE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /023W </p><p>                  ------------------88ED59  191836Z /38 </p><p>P 191732Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 3357 </p><p>INFO IRAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001962 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NP/RA, EUR/PRA, EUR/RUS, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, EU, WTO, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY WON\'T FORCE IRAN WTO ACCESSION ISSUE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01962  02 OF 02  191836Z </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) COMMENT.  ITALY GENERALLY SAVORS ITS OCCASIONAL ROLE </p><p>AS WASHINGTON-TEHRAN MESSAGE CARRIER, MOST RECENTLY EVIDENT </p><p>WHEN ITALY CONVEYED IRAN\'S CONCERN ABOUT ITS PROFILE IN DOD\'S </p><p>NUCLEAR POSTURE REVIEW.   THE ITALIANS, HOWEVER, DRAW THE </p><p>LINE AT ADOPTING AS THEIR OWN THE USG-SUGGESTED LINKAGE </p><p>BETWEEN POLITICAL REFORM AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION.  THE </p><p>ITALIAN ENERGY GIANT ENI, BY ITSELF, HAS TEN BILLION DOLLARS </p><p>AT RISK IN IRAN AND THE GOVERNMENT OF ITALY, ENI\'S BIGGEST </p><p>SHAREHOLDER, ISN\'T ABOUT TO MAKE IT MORE AT RISK.  MFA WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO PUSH IRAN ON WMD, BALLISTIC MISSILES, SUPPORT FOR </p><p>TERRORISM, AND THE REST, BUT ECONOMIC RELATIONS WILL CONTINUE </p><p>ALONG A DIFFERENT PATH.  IN PARTICULAR, ITALY HAS LONG </p><p>SUPPORTED IRAN FOR WTO ACCESSION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO, </p><p>ALBEIT NOT TO THE POINT OF PROVOKING AN EU CONFRONTATION WITH </p><p>THE U.S.  WE SHOULD EXPECT, MOREOVER, THAT THE ITALIANS WILL </p><p>COMMISERATE FULLY WITH INEVITABLE IRANIAN COMPLAINTS THAT USG </p><p>OBSTINACY ON WTO ACCESSION PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE IN </p><p>IRAN WHO OPPOSE REFORM. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01962 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
