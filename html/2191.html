<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 HANOI 002980 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>SECDEF FOR ABLAGG </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ECON, VM, DPOL </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROCESS: WHAT\'S UP? </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  HANOI 2885     B.  HANOI 2914 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE 1992 SRV </p><p>CONSTITUTION REPRESENT ATTEMPTS TO ENABLE GREATER </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN ECONOMIC LIFE AND TO ADJUST THE ROLES OF </p><p>VARIOUS PARTS OF GOVERNMENT, WITH POSSIBLE MORE POWER TO THE </p><p>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA).   EXPECTED APPROVAL OF AT LEAST SOME </p><p>AMENDMENTS BY THE NA DURING ITS NOVEMBER/DECEMBER SESSION </p><p>WILL MARK THE NEXT PHASE OF AN ALREADY LENGTHY PROCESS OF </p><p>SEEKING PUBLIC INPUT AND REACTION.  WHILE THE SRV TOUTS THIS </p><p>AS AN EXERCISE IN DEMOCRACY, IT IS ONE FIRMLY TIED TO THE </p><p>IDEA OF "DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM" IN A ONE PARTY STATE. </p><p>INDEED, THE CPV SEEMS TO BE TRUNCATING THE PROCESS AFTER </p><p>SOME NA MEMBERS AND CITIZENS APPARENTLY BEGAN TO CALL FOR </p><p>MORE COMPREHENSIVE CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES.  SEPTEL WILL </p><p>PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE UPCOMING NA SESSION AND </p><p>IMPLICATIONS OF LIKELY OUTCOMES. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>WHY CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION? </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  THE OFFICIAL JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDING THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION IS TO "STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF </p><p>THE STATE APPARATUS (NOTE: I.E., ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM, END </p><p>NOTE) AND ADDRESS URGENT ECONOMIC, CULTURAL, EDUCATIONAL, </p><p>SCIENTIFIC, AND TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES."  THE NINTH NATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS FORMALLY IDENTIFIED THESE ISSUES </p><p>EARLIER THIS YEAR, BUT SEVERAL AMENDMENTS REPORTEDLY HAD </p><p>BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.  THE CENTRAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02980  01 OF 05  150123Z </p><p>COMMITTEE REAFFIRMED THE CPV\'S VIEW OF THE AMENDMENTS IN AN </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF ITS FOURTH PLENUM ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 13, STRESSING THAT "ONLY ISSUES CONSIDERED TO BE </p><p>URGENT AND UNANIMOUSLY AGREED UPON WILL BE AMENDED AND </p><p>SUPPLEMENTED." </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  THE AMENDMENT PROCESS ITSELF (SEE PARAS 19-22 FOR </p><p>DESCRIPTION) REPORTEDLY GENERATED OVER TEN THOUSAND PUBLIC </p><p>COMMENTS.  AMONG THEM WERE CALLS FROM NA MEMBERS AND OTHERS </p><p>FOR COMPREHENSIVE CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.  SOME COMMENTS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO TRAN NHUNG, AN EDITOR OF THE PEOPLE\'S ARMY </p><p>NEWSPAPER WHO SPOKE WITH POLOFF ON OCTOBER 17, WERE SHARPLY </p><p>CRITICAL, EVEN CLAIMING THAT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WERE "A </p><p>STEP BACKWARD FROM THE 1946 CONSTITUTION."  ONE PURPOSE OF </p><p>THE AMENDMENTS AND OF THE AMENDMENT PROCESS ITSELF IS TO </p><p>ALLOW THE SRV TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT CAN MANAGE "DEMOCRACY" </p><p>IN A ONE PARTY STATE, ACCORDING TO CHRISTINE JOHANSSON, A </p><p>SWEDISH DIPLOMAT WITH WHOM POLOFF SPOKE ON OCTOBER 31.   THE </p><p>AMENDMENT PROCESS, SHE SAID, SERVES AS A WAY TO RE-LINK THE </p><p>PARTY WITH "THE PEOPLE."  JOHANSSON ALSO SUPERVISES A </p><p>SWEDISH ODA PROJECT TO HELP THE NA IMPROVE ITS OWN </p><p>SUPERVISORY FUNCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, MANY OBSERVERS HAD </p><p>PREDICTED THAT THE UPCOMING SESSION OF THE TENTH NA WOULD </p><p>DISCUSS -- BUT NOT RATIFY -- THE AMENDMENTS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>THEIR ANALYSES, THE NEW NA TO BE ELECTED IN MID-2002 WOULD </p><p>FORMALLY ADOPT THE AMENDMENTS.   HOWEVER, ON NOVEMBER 13, </p><p>NGO ANH DUNG, VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE NA FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>COMMITTEE, IN A MEETING WITH POL/C AND POLOFF, CLAIMED THAT </p><p>THE NA\'S AD HHOC STEERING COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02980  01 OF 05  150123Z </p><p>AMENDMENTS (CHAIRED BY NGUYEN VAN AN, CONCURRENTLY POLITBURO </p><p>MEMBER, NA CHAIRMAN, AND NA STANDING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN) HAD </p><p>REACHED CONSENSUS WITH NA DELEGATES ON FOCUSING ONLY ON </p><p>URGENT ISSUES THAT NEEDED UPDATING FROM THE 1992 </p><p>CONSTITUTION.  HIS REMARKS REFLECTED THE LANGUAGE SIMILAR </p><p>USED IN THAT DAY\'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING </p><p>ITS VIEWS ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.  DUNG NOTED THAT THE </p><p>AMENDMENT PROCESS COULD CONTINUE NEXT YEAR OR OVER SEVERAL </p><p>YEARS, BUT THAT, LIKE THE MUCH OLDER US CONSTITUTION, TOO </p><p>MANY AMENDMENTS WERE PROBABLY NOT NECESSARY. </p><p> </p><p>PAST CHANGES </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  SOME OBSERVERS HAVE NOTED A PATTERN OF AMENDING </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION ROUGHLY EVERY TEN YEARS.  TRAN NHUNG, OF </p><p>THE PEOPLE\'S ARMY NEWSPAPER, AND HISTORIAN HUU NGOC, IN A </p><p>SEPARATE CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF ON OCTOBER 19, EMPHASIZED </p><p>THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF EACH CONSTITUTION CHANGE.  BOTH </p><p>SAID THAT THE 1959 CONSTITUTION HAD REFLECTED LESSONS </p><p>LEARNED BY AUTHORITIES MORE USED TO FIGHTING A WAR THAN </p><p>RUNNING A COUNTRY.  THAT LONG AND DETAILED SOVIET-STYLE </p><p>CONSTITUTION WAS BOTH DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT AND TO CHANGE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO NGUYEN SI DUNG, DIRECTOR THE NA\'S CENTER FOR </p><p>INFORMATION, LIBRARY, AND RESEARCH SERVICES, WHO MET WITH </p><p>POLOFF ON OCTOBER 5.  EACH SUBSEQUENT CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN </p><p>AN EVOLUTION OF THE 1959 DOCUMENT, HE CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  HISTORIAN NGOC RECALLED THAT THEN-HOSTILE </p><p>RELATIONS WITH CHINA STIMULATED THE 1980 CONSTITUTION\'S ANTI- </p><p>CHINESE PREAMBLE LANGUAGE.  NGOC AND NHUNG IDENTIFIED THE </p><p>EARLY PHASES OF "DOI MOI" WITH THE 1992 CONSTITUTION.  HUU </p><p>NGOC SAID THAT THE 1992 VERSION CAME AT A TIME WHEN VIETNAM </p><p>WAS TRYING TO COME OUT OF A LONG ECONOMIC CRISIS AND </p><p>REPRESENTED VIETNAM\'S ATTEMPT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CATCH UP </p><p>WITH ITS NEIGHBORS.  WHILE HE SAID THAT THE 1992 AMENDMENTS </p><p>TO THE CONSTITUTION FOCUSED ON THE STATE\'S ECONOMIC SYSTEM, </p><p>HE BLAMED NATURAL DISASTERS AND FOREIGN INVASIONS, RATHER </p><p>THAN THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM ITSELF, FOR VIETNAM\'S EARLIER </p><p>ECONOMIC WOES. </p><p> </p><p>WHY THESE CHANGES? </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  NGO BA THANH, A NON-PARTY NA MEMBER ON THE AD HOC </p><p>STANDING COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WHO SERVED </p><p>AS WELL ON THE 1980 AND 1992 AMENDMENT COMMITTEES AND WHO </p><p>MET WITH POL/C AND POLOFF ON OCTOBER 11, STRESSED THAT NEW </p><p>AMENDMENTS WERE NEEDED TO "IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY AND </p><p>EFFICIENCY IN THE STATE APPARATUS" IN ORDER TO BUILD THE </p><p>NATION.  EDITOR TRAN NHUNG HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED NOWADAYS FOR </p><p>MORE AMENDMENTS RELATED TO THE ECONOMY, PARTICULARLY </p><p>REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MARKET ECONOMY AND </p><p>INTEGRATION WITH THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  NHUNG IDENTIFIED AN </p><p>OVERALL THEME OF MOVEMENT AWAY FROM A COMMAND ECONOMY, AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02980  02 OF 05  150124Z </p><p>MORE GENERALLY AWAY FROM "THE STATE COMMANDING AND THE </p><p>PEOPLE DOING."  INSTEAD, HE SAID, THE STATE MUST </p><p>INCREASINGLY "ENCOURAGE" THE PEOPLE TO UNDERTAKE MORE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY AND INITIATIVE.  NHUNG LINKED AMENDMENTS ON </p><p>FORMS OF OWNERSHIP, EDUCATION, AND THE RULE OF LAW TO THIS </p><p>THEME.  THESE ARE NEEDED SO THAT VIETNAM CAN OPERATE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY IN THE GLOBAL MARKET AND CAN ATTRACT MORE </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTORS, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  HUU NGOC HIGHLIGHTED THE VALUE OF PROPOSED </p><p>AMENDMENTS IN VIETNAM\'S EFFORTS TO BALANCE GLOBALIZATION AND </p><p>ECONOMIC EXPANSION WITH PRESERVATION OF ITS CULTURAL AND </p><p>SOCIAL IDENTITY.  HE CITED AMENDMENTS REGARDING BUILDING A </p><p>MORE EFFECTIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM AS THE MOST IMPORTANT, NOT </p><p>ONLY TO ENABLE PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, BUT ALSO </p><p>TO MAINTAIN VIETNAMESE DISTINCTIVENESS.  HE SAID THAT "DOI </p><p>MOI" HAD ALREADY ENCOURAGED COMPETITION, WHICH HAD BEEN </p><p>ABSENT UNDER SOCIALISM.  BUT THIS HAD LED TO INDIVIDUALISM </p><p>AND MATERIALISM, TRAITS HE CHARACTERIZED AS NEGATIVE AND </p><p>"WESTERN" IN OPPOSITION TO TRADITIONAL COLLECTIVE VALUES. </p><p>THE NA\'S DUNG NOTED THAT THE NATION AND IN PARTICULAR ITS </p><p>ECONOMY HAD CHANGED FROM THE EARLY DAYS OF "DOI MOI" </p><p>REFLECTED IN THE 1992 CONSTITUTION, AND ADMITTED THAT </p><p>SUBSEQUENT PROBLEMS OF CORRUPTION AND BUREAUCRATISM SPARKED </p><p>SOME OF THE CURRENT PROPOSED CHANGES. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT IS AT STAKE? </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  OPINIONS VARY WIDELY OVER WHICH AMENDMENTS ARE </p><p>MOST IMPORTANT AND OVER WHAT THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECTS WOULD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02980  02 OF 05  150124Z </p><p>BE.  WHILE MOST PROPOSED AMENDMENTS RELATE TO THE </p><p>MODIFICATIONS IN THE "STATE APPARATUS," ECONOMIC-RELATED </p><p>AMENDMENTS SEEMED HAVE ATTRACTED MORE INTEREST.  PROPOSED </p><p>RULE OF LAW LANGUAGE ALSO STIMULATED MUCH COMMENT.  WITHIN </p><p>THE "STATE APPARATUS," THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS, THE </p><p>NA, AND THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD ALL APPEAR POTENTIALLY TO </p><p>GAIN MORE POWER FROM PROPOSED AMENDMENTS.  HUU NGOC SAID </p><p>THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WERE NOT SOMETHING THAT </p><p>"THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE, THE FARMERS," WERE INTERESTED IN, </p><p>BUT HAD AT LEAST ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION AND ENGAGEMENT OF </p><p>THE MIDDLE STRATA AND INTELLECTUALS.  MS. JOHANSSON NOTED </p><p>THAT THE DISCUSSION PROCESS HAD GENERATED MUCH PUBLIC </p><p>INTEREST AND REVEALED DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AND APPROACH </p><p>BETWEEN ACADEMICS AND ORDINARY CITIZENS.   PROVINCIAL </p><p>OFFICIALS WITH WHOM POL/C MET ON OCTOBER 25-NOVEMBER 2 </p><p>TRAVELS BETWEEN HO CHI MINH CITY AND HANOI UNIFORMLY CLAIMED </p><p>CONSIDERABLE LOCAL INTEREST IN THE AMENDMENT PROCESS, BUT </p><p>WERE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO CITE EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC </p><p>AMENDMENTS OF CONCERN FOR THEIR RESIDENTS (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  TRAN NHUNG CITED ECONOMIC ACTORS AS THE BIGGEST </p><p>BENEFICIARIES OF SOME OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS.  REFERRING </p><p>TO PROPOSED CHANGES TO ARTICLES 16 AND 21 AND TO A LESSER </p><p>EXTENT TO ARTICLES 15, 19, AND 24, HE SAID THAT THESE </p><p>AMENDMENTS WOULD MEAN THAT NEW CONSTITUTION WOULD RECOGNIZE </p><p>"ALL" FORMS OF OWNERSHIP AND ALLOW ALL FORMS TO COMPETE ON </p><p>AN EQUAL BASIS.  NGUYEN SI DUNG NOTED THE CHANGE FROM "STATE- </p><p>RUN ECONOMY" TO "STATE (OR NATIONAL) ECONOMY" IN ARTICLE 16 </p><p>AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AMENDMENT, BECAUSE THIS </p><p>WOULD SIGNAL A REDUCTION OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER THE </p><p>ECONOMY.  NHUNG SAID THAT THESE CHANGES WOULD BE OF GREAT </p><p>BENEFIT TO BUSINESS OWNERS, BUT WOULD PUT MORE PRESSURE ON </p><p>STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOE\'S).  HE INDICATED THAT </p><p>ADAPTABLE SOE\'S COULD BE MAJOR BENEFICIARIES, WHILE THEIR </p><p>INFLEXIBLE COUNTERPARTS WOULD BE THE BIGGEST LOSERS. </p><p>NONETHELESS, NHUNG SAID THAT THESE AMENDMENTS MOST DIRECTLY </p><p>ANSWERED THE CONCERNS OF COMMON PEOPLE.  NGO BA THANH </p><p>SEPARATELY AGREED, COMMENTING THAT "THE PEOPLE ARE NOT MUCH </p><p>INTERESTED IN THE STATE APPARATUS.  THEY ARE JUST INTERESTED </p><p>IN THEIR RIGHTS TO DO BUSINESS." </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  OF ALL OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS, "RULE OF LAW" </p><p>CHANGES TO ARTICLES 2 AND 12 PERHAPS GENERATED THE HIGHEST </p><p>LEVEL OF SCHOLARLY DEBATE.  ARTICLE 2\'S PROPOSED AMENDMENT </p><p>WOULD SPECIFY THAT VIETNAM IS A "LAW GOVERNED, SOCIALIST" </p><p>STATE.  THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE 12 WOULD ELIMINATE </p><p>"THE STATE ADMINISTERS SOCIETY BY MEANS OF LAW, UNCEASINGLY </p><p>STRENGTHENING THE SOCIALIST LEGAL SYSTEM" IN FAVOR OF </p><p>"BUILDING THE LAW GOVERNED SOCIALIST STATE OF VIETNAM IS THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY ORGAN, ORGANIZATION AND CITIZEN." </p><p>BUT, ACCORDING TO NGUYEN SI DUNG, ADOPTION OF SUCH NEW RULE </p><p>OF LAW LANGUAGE WOULD BE ONLY A FORMAL DECLARATION, WITHOUT </p><p>PRACTICAL EFFECT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  NGUYEN SI DUNG CLAIMED THAT HO CHI MINH HAD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02980  03 OF 05  150124Z </p><p>ORIGINALLY EXPRESSED THE IDEAL BEHIND THESE AMENDMENTS IN </p><p>TERMS OF DESCRIBING VIETNAM AS A "STATE OF LAW" IN THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT THERE IS NO CONSENSUS YET THAT VIETNAM IS READY TO PUT </p><p>THE LAW ABOVE THE STATE; IT IS STILL "RULED BY LAW," AN </p><p>IMPORTANT DISTINCTION.  SOME OBSERVERS COMMENTED THAT </p><p>CURRENT WORDING OF ARTICLE 12 MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE LAW.  NGO BA THANH, </p><p>OF THE AMENDMENT DRAFTING COMMITTEE, SAID THAT THE MAIN </p><p>PURPOSE OF THESE AMENDMENTS IS TO "RAISE THE SENSE OF LAW </p><p>COMPLIANCE FOR ALL PEOPLE."   SWEDEN\'S JOHANSSON NOTED THAT </p><p>THE PROPOSED NEW LANGUAGE MIGHT BOIL DOWN TO ASSERTING </p><p>CENTRAL CONTROL IN A COUNTRY WHERE LOCAL DECREES OFTEN </p><p>CONTRADICT THE CONSTITUTION. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU)  A PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE THE REFERENCE TO </p><p>"COMPULSORY, FREE EDUCATION" FROM ARTICLE 59 REPORTEDLY DREW </p><p>WIDESPREAD PUBLIC CRITICISM.  (NOTE:  EDUCATION IS ONLY </p><p>COMPULSORY AND FREE THROUGH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL --5TH GRADE -- </p><p>AT PRESENT.  END NOTE)  NGUYEN SI DUNG CLAIMED THAT THIS </p><p>AMENDMENT HAD BEEN INTRODUCED AT THE BEHEST OF THOSE WHO ARE </p><p>WEALTHY ENOUGH TO PAY FOR PRIVATE EDUCATION.  CLAIMING THAT </p><p>IT WAS THE MOST UNPOPULAR NEW AMENDMENT, HE PREDICTED THAT </p><p>IT WOULD NOT PASS.  TRAN NHUNG OF THE PEOPLE\'S ARMY </p><p>NEWSPAPER OPINED THAT THIS AMENDMENT WOULD HAVE TWO POSITIVE </p><p>EFFECTS:  1) TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR "SOCIAL GROUPS AND </p><p>INDIVIDUALS TO CONTRIBUTE TO PRIMARY EDUCATION" BY </p><p>ENCOURAGING MORE PRIVATE SCHOOLS (ALREADY LEGAL BUT STILL </p><p>RELATIVELY FEW); AND, 2) TO ALLOW GOVERNMENT EDUCATION </p><p>BUDGETS TO BE TARGETED TO HELP THE NEEDIER RURAL AND UPLAND </p><p>AREAS.  PRESS REPORTS HAVE NOTED THAT MANY CITIZENS OPPOSED </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02980  03 OF 05  150124Z </p><p>THIS AMENDMENT, FEARING THAT IT WOULD MEAN THE END OF FREE </p><p>PRIMARY EDUCATION.  NHUNG INSISTED THAT THIS WOULD NOT </p><p>HAPPEN, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>THE STATE APPARATUS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  AMENDMENTS CONCERNING ORGANIZATION OF THE "STATE </p><p>APPARATUS" (ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM) HAVE ATTRACTED RELATIVELY </p><p>LITTLE PUBLIC ATTENTION, BUT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SPOKE TO </p><p>POLOFF IDENTIFIED THESE AS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT PROPOSED </p><p>CHANGES.  THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE EMPHASIZED THESE AMENDMENTS </p><p>IN ITS NOVEMBER 13 ANNOUNCEMENT.  THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES, </p><p>ACCORDING TO NGUYEN SI DUNG AND MS. THANH, MANDATE MORE </p><p>"DECENTRALIZATION" OF POWER FROM THE CENTER TO THE </p><p>PROVINCES.  OTHER PROPOSED AMENDMENTS INCLUDE MEASURES </p><p>GIVING MORE POWER TO THE NA AND THE PRIME MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>15.  (SBU)  ONE EXAMPLE OF "DECENTRALIZATION" WOULD BE </p><p>PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO INCREASE THE AUTHORITY OF PROVINCIAL </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS BY GIVING THEM MORE BUDGET APPROPRIATION </p><p>AUTHORITY.  AN AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE 84 WOULD ACCOMPLISH THIS </p><p>BY SUBSTITUTING "CENTRAL" (TRUNG UONG) FOR "STATE" (NHA </p><p>NUOC) IN REFERENCE TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY\'S BUDGET </p><p>APPROPRIATION DUTIES.  IN THIS CONTEXT, "CENTRAL" MEANS THE </p><p>NATIONAL-LEVEL GOVERNMENT ONLY, WHILE "STATE" REFERS TO </p><p>GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS.  ACCORDING TO NGUYEN SI DUNG, THIS </p><p>WOULD CHANGE THE CURRENT PROVINCIAL FUNDING MECHANISM IN </p><p>WHICH THE PROVINCES RECEIVE EARMARKED FUNDING FROM THE NA </p><p>BASED ON REQUESTS PASSED THROUGH THE FINANCE MINISTRY.  IN </p><p>THE FUTURE, PROVINCES WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO ALLOCATE OR </p><p>REALLOCATE BLOCK APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE NA.  HE ADDED THAT </p><p>CENTRALIZED DECISION-MAKING HAD BEEN GOOD DURING WARTIME, </p><p>BUT MORE "DECENTRALIZATION" WOULD BE BETTER FOR PEACE.  THE </p><p>POINT OF THIS AMENDMENT, ACCORDING TO BOTH MS. THANH AND </p><p>NGUYEN SI DUNG, WOULD BE TO ENCOURAGE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS </p><p>TO TAKE MORE INITIATIVE AND RESPONSIBILITY.  (REF B REPORTED </p><p>ON THE DIFFICULTIES AND AMBIGUITIES OF "DECENTRALIZATION," </p><p>PARTICULARLY THAT PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS DO NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO UNDERTAKE ADDITIONAL </p><p>FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.)  NHUNG ADMITTED THAT NO ONE KNOWS </p><p>EXACTLY HOW THIS AMENDMENT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED, A PROBLEM </p><p>NGUYEN SI DUNG ALSO RAISED. </p><p> </p><p>16.  (SBU)  THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD POTENTIALLY GAIN </p><p>MORE POWER THROUGH OTHER PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLE 84, </p><p>MARKING A CONTINUATION OF A GRADUAL TREND TOWARDS A LARGER </p><p>FORMAL ROLE FOR THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  ONE OF THE PROPOSALS </p><p>WOULD GIVE THE NA THE RIGHT TO INITIATE NO-CONFIDENCE VOTES </p><p>ON OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE STATE PRESIDENT, THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, CABINET MINISTERS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME </p><p>PEOPLE\'S COURT, AND THE CHIEF PROCURATOR OF THE SUPREME </p><p>PEOPLE\'S PROCURACY.  NGUYEN SI DUNG CLAIMED THAT THIS IN </p><p>EFFECT WAS ONLY A STEP AWAY FROM A SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND </p><p>BALANCES, SINCE THE NA WOULD HAVE MORE EXPLICIT AUTHORITY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02980  04 OF 05  150124Z </p><p>OVER THE JUDICIARY BRANCH.  HE WORRIED THAT THESE AMENDMENTS </p><p>WOULD FURTHER UNDERMINE ALREADY WEAK JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, </p><p>HOWEVER.  OTHER OBSERVERS HAVE COMMENTED THAT THE AMENDMENTS </p><p>ARE SUPERFLUOUS SINCE THE 1992 CONSTITUTION\'S CHAPTER SIX </p><p>(WHICH INCLUDES ARTICLE 84 OF THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION) </p><p>ALREADY GIVES THE NA EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO "ELECT, RELEASE </p><p>FROM DUTY, REMOVE FROM OFFICE" THESE SENIOR STATE OFFICIALS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU)  MS. THANH SEPARATELY SAID THAT SHE REGARDED THE </p><p>AMENDMENTS ON THE NA AS A "DEVELOPMENT OF CENTRALIST </p><p>DEMOCRACY, BECAUSE THE NA, REPRESENTING GEOGRAPHICAL </p><p>DISTRICTS AND SOCIAL SECTORS, SHOULD BE ABOVE THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>AND JUDICIARY."  ACCORDING TO NGUYEN SI DUNG, THE INTENT OF </p><p>THESE AMENDMENTS IS TO INCREASE THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  OTHER AMENDMENTS WOULD GIVE THE NA </p><p>STANDING COMMITTEE MORE POWER TO ACT BETWEEN FULL ASSEMBLY </p><p>SESSIONS, BUT THESE PROPOSALS SEEM TO BE UNPOPULAR WITH MANY </p><p>ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU)  SOME PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD ALSO GIVE THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER MORE POWER, ESPECIALLY OVER LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENTS, THROUGH STRENGTHENED ABILITY TO APPOINT, </p><p>DISMISS, AND TRANSFER PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE </p><p>CHAIRPERSONS.  THE EXECUTIVES AT LOWER ECHELONS WOULD ALSO </p><p>GET CORRESPONDING AUTHORITY OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE SUB- </p><p>DIVISIONS.  MS. THANH AND NGUYEN SI DUNG EXPLAINED THAT THIS </p><p>WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE PROVINCIAL EXECUTIVES MORE ACCOUNTABLE </p><p>TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  NGUYEN SI DUNG COMMENTED THAT </p><p>THIS COULD ALSO MAKE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN </p><p>MORE BEHOLDEN TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND LESS RESPONSIVE TO </p><p>LOCAL NEEDS.  HOWEVER, NHUNG SAID THAT THIS AMENDMENT WOULD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02980  04 OF 05  150124Z </p><p>"ENHANCE STATE MANAGEMENT" BY ENCOURAGING LOCAL EXECUTIVES </p><p>TO BE MORE ANSWERABLE TO THE CENTER FOR THEIR ACTIONS.  IT </p><p>WOULD MAKE POSSIBLE, HE SAID, "PUNISHMENT AND CORRECTION" </p><p>FOR MISTAKES BY MOVING AWAY FROM A COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP </p><p>SYSTEM WHICH OBSCURES RESPONSIBILITY.  OTHER PROPOSED </p><p>AMENDMENTS WOULD REPLACE THE TERM "STATE OFFICIAL" WITH </p><p>"PUBLIC OFFICIAL" THROUGHOUT THE CONSTITUTION.   NHUNG SAID </p><p>THAT THESE CHANGES MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE PRIME MINISTER TO </p><p>EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER THE GOVERNMENT.  OTHER COMMENTATORS </p><p>HAVE NOTED THAT THE PROPOSED DESIGNATION MAKES CLEAR THAT </p><p>OFFICIALS SERVE "THE PEOPLE" DIRECTLY RATHER THAN WORKING </p><p>ONLY FOR THE STATE. </p><p> </p><p>THE AMENDMENT PROCESS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  (U)  AFTER THE NINTH PARTY CONGRESS CONCLUDED, THE AD </p><p>HOC STEERING COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS CHAIRED </p><p>BY NGUYEN VAN AN DRAFTED THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS, PUBLICIZED </p><p>THEM, AND INVITED PUBLIC COMMENT FROM AUGUST 16 TO SEPTEMBER </p><p>30.  THE AD HOC COMMITTEE CONDUCTED MEETINGS WITH VARIOUS </p><p>POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>AMENDMENTS.  THE PRESS COVERED NEGATIVE, AS WELL AS </p><p>POSITIVE, REACTIONS BY COMMON CITIZENS.  NA STAFF THEN </p><p>SUMMARIZED THE COMMENTS IN A REPORT THAT THE AD HOC </p><p>COMMITTEE REVIEWED FROM OCTOBER 8 TO 10. </p><p> </p><p>20.  (SBU)  THE PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE THEN REVIEWED THE </p><p>AMENDMENTS AND COMMENTS DURING ITS NOVEMBER 5-13 PLENUM.  AS </p><p>NOTED ABOVE, IT THEN CLEARLY INDICATED THAT IT WANTS TO </p><p>LIMIT CONSIDERATION TO THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED AT THE NINTH </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS, LIMITING THE SCOPE FOR DEBATE IN THE NA. </p><p>MS. THANH HAD EARLIER PREDICTED THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE NEXT </p><p>SESSION OF THE TENTH NA WOULD BE SPENT ON CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>AMENDMENTS, BUT IT IS NO LONGER CERTAIN THIS WILL BE TRUE. </p><p>THIS NA SESSION WILL ALSO TAKE UP THE BTA, CHANGES TO THREE </p><p>LAWS, AND THE BUDGET. </p><p> </p><p>21.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO TRAN NHUNG, THE PROCESS IS BROADLY </p><p>SIMILAR TO THE PROCESSES THAT LED TO THE 1980 AND 1992 </p><p>CONSTITUTIONS, BUT IS MORE OPEN AND INVOLVES GREATER PUBLIC </p><p>PARTICIPATION.  HE NOTED THAT A REPORT ON THE PUBLIC </p><p>COMMENTS WOULD BE PUBLISHED, UNLIKE PREVIOUSLY, AND </p><p>INDICATED THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY ACCOMPANY THE REPORT OF THE </p><p>AD HOC COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS TO THE NA </p><p>STANDING COMMITTEE.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE SCOPE FOR PUBLIC </p><p>COMMENT WAS LARGER THAN BEFORE, WITH MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR </p><p>PUBLIC COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>22.  (SBU)  SWEDEN\'S JOHANSSON CHARACTERIZED THE PROCESS AS </p><p>A "CONTROLLED DEBATE."  SHE SAID THAT IT ALLOWED MORE </p><p>INTERNAL CONSULTATION AND FEATURED MORE USE OF THE PRESS AND </p><p>MASS ORGANIZATIONS THAN BEFORE.  THIS REFLECTED MORE </p><p>ATTENTION TO "DEMOCRACY" IN A ONE-PARTY SYSTEM, SHE OPINED. </p><p>SHE ADDED THAT THE ONGOING PROCESS AT LEAST HELPED TO </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02980  05 OF 05  150125Z </p><p>STIMULATE MORE DEBATE ABOUT RIGHTS AND THE RIGHT TO COMPLAIN </p><p>THAN WOULD HAVE OCCURRED EVEN TWO YEARS AGO.  (NOTE:  ONE </p><p>COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT JOHANSSON MANAGES INCLUDES </p><p>FAMILIARIZING THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WITH THE SWEDISH </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S OMBUDSMAN.  SHE SAID THAT WHILE THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY FOUND THE IDEA INTRIGUING, SHE DID NOT EXPECT THEM </p><p>TO CREATE AN OMBUDSMAN ANY TIME SOON.  END NOTE.)  SHE </p><p>ASSESSED THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROCESS REFLECTED </p><p>THAT PARTY AND NA WORK HAD BECOME MORE OPEN, AT LEAST WITHIN </p><p>THE BOUNDARIES OF "DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM." </p><p> </p><p>EXPECTED OUTCOMES </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>23.  (U)  OPINIONS DIFFER OVER HOW MUCH THE AMENDMENTS MAY </p><p>CHANGE FROM THEIR ORIGINAL FORM TO WHATEVER THE NA ADOPTS, </p><p>AS WELL AS HOW MANY AMENDMENTS WILL MAKE IT THROUGH THE NA </p><p>APPROVAL PROCESS.  BOTH THE NOVEMBER 13 CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT AND NGO ANH DUNG\'S COMMENTS SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>THERE WILL BE LITTLE OR NOTHING IN THE WAY OF ADDITIONS TO </p><p>THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS DURING NA CONSIDERATION, APART FROM </p><p>SOME POSSIBLE DELETIONS OR MINOR CHANGES.  NGO BA THANH HAD </p><p>SAID THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGES BECAUSE "ALL" OF THE </p><p>AMENDMENTS ARE "NECESSARY" FOR VIETNAM\'S PROGRESS IN THE </p><p>21ST CENTURY.  NGUYEN SI DUNG PREDICTED THAT SOME OF THE </p><p>MOST UNPOPULAR AMENDMENTS WOULD NOT PASS, ESPECIALLY </p><p>REGARDING EDUCATION.  TRAN NHUNG HAD FORECASTED "HARD </p><p>DISCUSSIONS" DURING THE UPCOMING NA SESSION, GIVEN THE </p><p>EXPECTED UNFAVORABLE REACTIONS FROM SOME NA MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02980  05 OF 05  150125Z </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>24.  (SBU)  MUCH OF THIS AMENDMENT EXERCISE SEEMS DESIGNED </p><p>PRIMARILY TO CREATE A SENSE OF PUBLIC EMPOWERMENT AND/OR TO </p><p>VEST "THE PEOPLE" WITH A SENSE OF GREATER PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>THE POLITICAL SYSTEM.  MANY OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE </p><p>AT BEST SYMBOLIC, LIKE THE SUBSTITUTION OF "PUBLIC" FOR </p><p>"STATE" OFFICIAL, BUT AT LEAST REFLECT A WELCOME RECOGNITION </p><p>OF A GROWING CIVIL SOCIETY, INSTEAD OF A PURELY PARTY/STATE- </p><p>LED NATION.  IT IS NOT CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT THE SRV HAS </p><p>SUCCEEDED IN ENGAGING THE GENUINE ATTENTION OF ITS CITIZENS </p><p>IN THIS PROCESS, HOWEVER, OR THAT THIS PROCESS WOULD HAVE </p><p>ANY EFFECT ON MITIGATING PERCEPTIONS ABOUT ARBITRARY </p><p>OFFICIAL DECISION-MAKING OR WIDESPREAD CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>CORRUPTION BY PARTY AND STATE OFFICIALS.  AS MUCH AS THE SRV </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO PORTRAY THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROCESS AS </p><p>"DEMOCRATIC," IT WOULD BE A GREAT LEAP TO SAY THAT ITS FORM </p><p>OR CONTENT REFLECT ANY TRULY GRASSROOTS INITIATIVE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY AFTER THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE MADE CLEAR IT </p><p>SUPPORTED A FOCUSED RATHER THAN COMPREHENSIVE DEBATE ON </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
