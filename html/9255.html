Summary:  The 124th Session of the UN Food and </p><p>Agriculture Organization (FAO) Council met June 23-28 in </p><p>Rome.  In a successful outcome to a four-year campaign by </p><p>assorted OECD members, the Council agreed to transmit to </p><p>the 32nd FAO Conference an amendment to the FAO Basic </p><p>Texts to introduce a two-term, 10-year limit for the FAO </p><p>Director General (DG) position.  The G-77 (particularly </p><p>African members) pushed hard to have  Council explicitly </p><p>acknowledge the DG\'s eligibility to run again at the next </p><p>elections; after prolonged negotiations, USDel succeeded </p><p>in ensuring that the Council decision is silent </p><p>concerning the incumbent.  The Council also endorsed a </p><p>U.S. agenda item and proposal on improving reporting on </p><p>World Food Summit follow-up.  As expected, the Council </p><p>did not take a final position on the 2004-2005 budget </p><p>level, but did acknowledge the need for the Secretariat </p><p>to prepare a zero nominal growth (ZNG) budget scenario. </p><p>Although the DG may still choose not to prepare such a </p><p>scenario, this is an important step for the U.S. and </p><p>other ZNG supporters.  Citing budget woes at home, the </p><p>Japanese delegation requested a "less than ZNG scenario" </p><p>and argued (unsuccessfully) for the Council to consider </p><p>its proposal to increase Asian participation in the FAO </p><p>Finance and Program Committees.  The Japanese delegation </p><p>told USDel that their government was re-examining Japan\'s </p><p>continued participation in FAO.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The 124th session of the FAO Council met June 23-28, </p><p>2003 in Rome.  USDA Deputy Undersecretary Jim Butler </p><p>headed the U.S. delegation, with Ambassador Tony P. Hall </p><p>serving as Alternate.  The Independent Chair of Council, </p><p>Ambassador Aziz Mekouar (Morocco) chaired the session. </p><p>The United States represented North America in the </p><p>drafting committee. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Agenda item 1, Adoption of the Agenda. </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>The Council agreed to add new agenda items on "Reporting </p><p>on World Food Summit Follow-up" (U.S. proposal) and </p><p>"Composition of the Program and Finance Committees" </p><p>(Japanese proposal). </p><p> </p><p>4.  Agenda Item 3, Summary Program of Work and Budget </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>As expected, the Council did not take a final position on </p><p>the budget level for the Summary Program of Work and </p><p>Budget (SPWB) 2004-2005.  The United States, Australia </p><p>and Canada requested a ZNG scenario; the G-77 (with some </p><p>exceptions, notably Malaysia, which joined in requesting </p><p>a ZNG scenario) for the most part spoke in support of the </p><p>DG\'s real growth (RG) proposal. The EU requested the </p><p>Secretariat to consider a scenario somewhere between ZNG </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>and ZRG which covered exchange rate losses, but which </p><p>absorbed cost increases and a first tranche of funding </p><p>for after-service medical liabilities.  Other OECD </p><p>members also stressed the importance of addressing </p><p>unfunded after-service medical liabilities, albeit </p><p>without offering specific solutions.  Japan stated that </p><p>it would only be able to support a budget which saw a </p><p>"decline in Japan\'s assessment" and requested that a </p><p>"less-than-ZNG scenario" be prepared. </p><p> </p><p>5.  During Drafting Committee discussion of the SPWB, RG </p><p>supporters strongly objected to including a request for a </p><p>ZNG scenario.  After extensive negotiations between </p><p>supporters of ZNG, ZRG and RG, members finally agreed </p><p>that the Council would "acknowledged the need for the </p><p>Secretariat to prepare a ZNG scenario in order for </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>members to fully understand the implications of a </p><p>possible budget decisions."  Comment:  Budget Director </p><p>Tony Wade refused to comment on whether the Secretariat </p><p>would indeed prepare a ZNG budget based on the Report </p><p>language, indicating that the decision would be taken by </p><p>the DG.  Nonetheless, ZNG supporters considered the </p><p>language an important first step towards that end. End </p><p> </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Concerning priorities for the 2004-2005 budget, the </p><p>Council agreed that the International Plant Protection </p><p>Convention (IPPC) "should be funded to the level of the </p><p>biennial business plan, and that FAO should provide its </p><p>share of the additional resources required for the </p><p>accepted recommendations of the Joint FAO/WHO evaluation </p><p>of the Codex Alimentarius Commission to be implemented in </p><p>the full."  The report also notes that, as agreed at the </p><p>FAO Program Committee (reftel A), the proposed funding </p><p>for a "Food Chain Approach" which actually related to the </p><p>failed FAO proposal of the same name (reftel B) would be </p><p>reallocated to Codex activities. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Agenda Item 4, Report of the Committee on Commodity </p><p>Problems </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Reflecting the U.S. position taken during the Committee </p><p>on Commodity Problems (CCP), the Council endorsed the </p><p>report of the 64th Session of the CCP "recalling that one </p><p>member had disassociated from the consensus adoption of </p><p>the Report and had maintained that position." </p><p> </p><p>8.  Agenda Items 5 and 3, Committees on Forestry and </p><p>Fisheries </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>The Council endorsed the reports of the Committees on </p><p>Forestry and Fisheries. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Agenda Item 6, Report of the Committee on Agriculture </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>The Council endorsed the Report of the Committee on </p><p>Agriculture (COAG) and welcomed the announcement that the </p><p>DG would convene a special session of COAG in early 2004 </p><p>to review the Report of the Joint WHO/FAO Expert </p><p>Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of </p><p>Chronic Disease.  The Council noted the concerns of some </p><p>members that the recommendations could result in changes </p><p>in demand with adverse impacts on small producers and the </p><p>agricultural economies of developing countries.  Under </p><p>the Report of COAG and the Report of the Committee on </p><p>Commodity Problems, members also supported having the </p><p>Secretariat propose ways to reduce the total number of </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>days allotted to the two meetings, possibly by holding </p><p>them jointly or back to back.  A proposal along these </p><p>lines will be sent to the next Council session. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Agenda Item 7, Report of the Committee on World Food </p><p>Security </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>Ambassador Tony P. Hall delivered the U.S. intervention </p><p>on the Report of the Committee on World Food Security </p><p>(CFS). The Council considered the proposal to improve the </p><p>reporting format for the World Food Summit (WFS) follow- </p><p>up on the basis of the request put forward by the United </p><p>States and supported by the EU. The Council endorsed the </p><p>proposal that the CFS Secretariat, in close collaboration </p><p>with the Bureau, should: </p><p> </p><p>--analyze the difficulties and the underlying reasons in </p><p>the current reporting process; </p><p>-- examine ways of improving the existing reporting </p><p>system; </p><p>--identify a set of appropriate qualitative and </p><p>quantitative indicators based on experience with FIVIMS </p><p>and previous reporting mechanisms, including the impact </p><p>of HIV/AIDS on food security; </p><p>--supplement the report with case studies of successfully </p><p>country experiences from which lessons learned could be </p><p>extracted.  The reporting should be based on simplified </p><p>and improved methodology. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The Council recommended that the draft revised </p><p>format be developed in consultation with the CFS bureau </p><p>and submitted to the forthcoming session of the FAO </p><p>Council. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Agenda Item 8, Convening of the Second Global Forum </p><p>of Food Safety Regulators </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>The Council endorsed the proposal to hold a Second Global </p><p>Forum of Food Safety Regulators during the second half of </p><p>2004 on the main theme of "Building Effective Food Safety </p><p>Systems." The Government of Thailand offered to host the </p><p>Forum. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Agenda Item 9, Report of the World Food Program </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Ambassador Tony P. Hall delivered the U.S. intervention </p><p>on the Report of the World Food Program.  The Council </p><p>"reaffirmed its support for WFP\'s dual mandate to assist </p><p>the hungry poor in both emergency situations and in the </p><p>field of development and expressed its support for WFP\'s </p><p>innovative efforts to increase the level of resources </p><p>provided by non-traditional donors, particularly the </p><p>private sector." </p><p> </p><p>14.  Agenda Item 10, Preparations for the 32nd Session of </p><p>the FAO General Conference </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>The Minister of Agriculture and Trade of New Zealand will </p><p>chair the Conference.  The Vice-Chairs are: Austria (name </p><p>not yet known) and Iran (FAO Ambassador Nouri-Naeeni). </p><p>Canada will represent North America on the Credentials </p><p>Committee.  There will be three ministerial-level round </p><p>tables.  The Secretariat will contact regional groups </p><p>concerning proposed themes and logistics.  The deadline </p><p>for nominations for the Independent Chair of Council is </p><p>September 5; for election to Council, November 29 at </p><p>12:00. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Agenda Item 15, Report of the Finance Committee </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>The Council approved the proposed scale of assessments. </p><p>The Council took note of Argentina\'s request to have its </p><p>assessment be reduced along the lines of the reduction at </p><p>the UN, but took no action on the request.   Concerning </p><p>the Split Currency Assessment Proposal, the Council took </p><p>note of the differing views presented (including U.S. </p><p>objections) and agreed that the matter would need to be </p><p>considered in greater depth at the upcoming Finance </p><p>Committee session. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Under the Finance Committee Sub-Item on "Methodology </p><p>for Determination of Equitable Geographic Distribution," </p><p>the Council noted that the September 2003 Finance </p><p>Committee session would conduct a further analysis of the </p><p>options for the methodology prior to submitting a </p><p>recommendation to the Council at its next session. The </p><p>Report states the U.S. position as follows:  "Another </p><p>member stated that practices to promote adequate </p><p>representation of under-represented countries would need </p><p>to be implemented before looking at any proposal to </p><p>change the system of equitable geographic distribution." </p><p> </p><p>17.  Agenda Item 16, the Number and Length of Term of the </p><p>Office of the Director General </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>As reported in Reftel C, documentation for this agenda </p><p>was still not available at the opening of Council.  USDel </p><p>met numerous times during the week with the Friends of </p><p>the Chair, seeking to resolve the question of what would </p><p>be put before the Council for decision.  At the outset, </p><p>the G-77 and the EU supported having the Council </p><p>"approve" a report of the Friends of the Chair (provided </p><p>by the Chair on June 20). The Chair\'s June 20 report </p><p>contained language concerning the incumbent\'s eligibility </p><p>to run again which was inconsistent with the Group\'s </p><p>decision to be "silent" on the question of transition </p><p>measures.  (Comment: Other OECD members of the Friends </p><p>group -- Australia, New Zealand and Canada -- told USDel </p><p>privately that they could accept the language of the </p><p>report as a Council decision but were supportive duringTION 04 OF 05 ROME </p><p>003111 </p><p> </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/LYNN REICH AND DICK HUGHES </p><p>USDA/APHIS FOR JOHN GREIFER </p><p>USDA/FSIS FOR ED SCARBROUGH </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA SETH WINNICK AND IO/S GEORGE ABRAHAMS </p><p>USAID FOR RALPH CUMMINGS </p><p>PARIS FOR UNESCO </p><p>MONTREAL F </p><p>negotiations. End comment). </p><p> </p><p>18.  The Group finally agreed to put before Council: </p><p> </p><p>-- A Council decision (CL/124/13) which "agreed to </p><p>transmit the proposed amendment to Article VII.1 of the </p><p>Constitution that "the DG should be appointed for a term </p><p>of six years, renewable only once for a further term of </p><p>four years," to the FAO Committee on Constitutional and </p><p>Legal Matters, at its 75th Session, in October 2003, </p><p>along with document CL/123/INF/22 before being submitted </p><p>to the 32nd Session of the Conference for adoption." </p><p> </p><p>-- A Council information document (CL 124/INF/22) </p><p>containing the Report of the Friends of the Chair (with </p><p>improved language negotiated by USDel) </p><p> </p><p>19.  The Chair put the decision before the Council on </p><p>Thursday, June 27 after a brief introduction.  In his </p><p>introductory reports, the Chair did not mention the </p><p>content of the Report of the Friends of the Chair, and </p><p>made no reference to the incumbent. Te decision was </p><p>adopted by acclamation with no coments from the floor. </p><p> </p><p>20.  The Report of the Frinds of the Chair, in its final </p><p>form, provided th view of the Legal Counsel that, in the </p><p>absence f transitional measures, the Conference "would </p><p>hve the authority to elect under the new system anyof </p><p>the nominated candidates."  The rights of the ncumbent </p><p>are not specifically mentioned.  The Reort also states </p><p>that the revision of Article VII1 would apply to the </p><p>election at the 33rd Sessio of Conference in 2005 and </p><p>govern the mandates o the Directors-General from 1 </p><p>January 2006. (Commnt: the entry into force was already </p><p>agreed at te 123rd Council session which established the </p><p>madate of the Friends of the Chair Group.  End commet). </p><p> </p><p>21.  Agenda Item 16.5, Japanese request on omposition of </p><p>Finance and Program Committees </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>Japan, supported by the Republic of Korea, circulaed two </p><p>proposals to amend FAO\'s Basic Texts concrning </p><p>membership of the Program and Finance Commttees in order </p><p>to increase Asian representation o the Committees.  As </p><p>expected, the proposals wer strongly objected to by </p><p>other regions that saw  threat to their presence on </p><p>these Committees.  he Council agreed that the Asia </p><p>Regional Group culd continue to hold further </p><p>consultations with other regional groups to further </p><p>advance the issue  The Council did not agree to place </p><p>the item onthe agenda for the next session (as the </p><p>Japaneserequested). </p><p> </p><p>22.  Agenda Item 18 - Appointment t the UN Joint Staff </p><p>Pension Committee </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>The Concil confirmed the appointment of Mr. Bruce </p><p>Bertn, Alternate Permanent Representative of the Unite </p><p>States as a member to the Staff Pension Committe for the </p><p>period ending 31 December 2004 to replace and complete </p><p>the term of office of Mr. Chris Rchard. </p><p>23.  Comment: on Term Limits and Japanes participation </p><p>in FAO </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Council endorsemet of Term Limits represents a </p><p>successful outcome to a four-year campaign by assorted </p><p>OECD members,albeit, with one more hurdle to pass (the </p><p>32nd FAO Conference) and without a prohibition on the </p><p>incumbent running again (as U.S. had originally sought). </p><p>However, in its final form, the Report of the Chair is </p><p>neutral on the question of the incumbent and the Council </p><p>Decision itself makes no mention of transitional </p><p>measures. </p><p> </p><p>24.  The Japanese delegation expressed disappointed to </p><p>USDel at the outcome of Council and commented that </p><p> </p><p>Japan\'s continued participation in the FAO was being re- </p><p>examined in Tokyo.  The Japanese Perm Rep noted in this </p><p>context that Japan had not yet paid its 2003 assessment. </p><p>We understand that the FAO Director General appears to be </p><p>seriously seeking to increase Japanese staffing at the </p><p>FAO (another perennial source of unhappiness for the </p><p>Japanese).
