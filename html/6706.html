UPON RE-ENTRY, THEY WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE </p><p>IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MAJOR INTERVENTIONS THAT MAY BE </p><p>REQUIRED VIS-A-VIS THE PDS IN THE POST-CONFLICT SITUATION. </p><p>THESE TEAMS WILL BE FURTHER AUGMENTED WITH SUPPORT STAFF </p><p>(ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS) DEPLOYED THROUGH A PRIVATE </p><p>CONTRACTOR FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO MOTIVATE AND </p><p>ORGANIZE MINISTRY OF TRADE (MOT) STAFF STILL OPERATIONAL IN </p><p>EACH GOVERNORATE CAPITAL. COMMUNICATION WITH THE STAFF IN </p><p>THE INITIAL STAGE WILL BE BY A POUCH SYSTEM WITH ARRIVING </p><p>FOOD TRUCKS, AND ANY OTHER OPERATIONAL MEANS INCLUDING </p><p>TELEPHONE TRUNK LINES AND NGO HF FACILITIES WHERE AVAILABLE. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) DUE TO THE POSSIBLE DISRUPTION OF THE PDS, WFP </p><p>WILL BE EXPECTED TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE DISTRIBUTION </p><p>MECHANISM FROM EXTENDED DELIVERY POINTS (EDPS) TO THE FINAL </p><p>DELIVERY POINTS (FDPS) AND BENEFICIARIES, AND TO IDENTIFY </p><p>AND ADDRESS POSSIBLE BOTTLENECKS IN THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. </p><p>TO THIS EFFECT, WFP WILL EMPLOY NATIONAL STAFF IN EACH </p><p>GOVERNORATE AND INTENDS TO CONTRACT PRIVATE CONSULTANTS AND </p><p>ENGAGE NGOS TO BE DEPLOYED IN EACH GOVERNORATE, TO PROVIDE </p><p>SUPPORT TO THE MOT\'S MANAGEMENT AND LOGISTICS STRUCTURES, AS </p><p>WELL AS TO FOOD AGENTS. </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) SUPPORT MAY INVOLVE THE PROVISION OF FUEL TO FOOD </p><p>AGENTS TO ENABLE THEM TO CARRY ON THE COLLECTION OF </p><p>COMMODITIES FROM EDPS TO FDPS, DIVERSION OF LONG-HAUL TRUCKS </p><p>DIRECTLY TO FDPS WHERE NEEDED, AND/OR WFP PROVIDING </p><p>TRANSPORT CAPACITY THROUGH THE HIRING OF LOCAL TRANSPORT TO </p><p>EFFECT DELIVERIES TO FDPS. DURING THE CONFLICT, IT IS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01220  04 OF 05  241312Z </p><p>ENVISAGED THAT MOT STAFF MAY BE PROVIDED WITH IN-KIND </p><p>PAYMENTS OF FOOD IN LIEU OF CASH AS INCENTIVES, GIVEN THE </p><p>RISK EXPECTED IN MOVEMENT OF CASH FUNDS IN AN INSECURE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT AND THE POSSIBLE DISRUPTION OF GOVERNMENT </p><p>PAYROLL DISBURSEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) APPROXIMATELY 1,609,500 METRIC TONS OF FOOD </p><p>COMMODITIES WILL BE MOVED INTO IRAQ OVER A SIX-MONTH PERIOD. </p><p>GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE CONFLICT, THE REGIONAL </p><p>LOGISTICS STRATEGY IS CENTRED ON A DIVERSIFICATION OF </p><p>CORRIDORS, ROUTES AND MODALITIES AND A HIGH DEGREE OF </p><p>FLEXIBILITY TO SWITCH BETWEEN THEM AT SHORT NOTICE. WFP IS </p><p>ESTIMATING FOR PLANNING PURPOSES THAT FIVE PER CENT OF THE </p><p>FOOD REQUIRED FOR THIS OPERATION WILL BE PROCURED LOCALLY OR </p><p>REGIONALLY. A KEY ASSUMPTION FOR THIS EMOP IS THAT THE PORT </p><p>OF UMM QASR WILL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE INITIALLY.  HENCE, WFP </p><p>WILL RELY ON CORRIDORS THROUGH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. </p><p>LOGISTICS ARRANGEMENTS ARE IN ADVANCED STAGES IN THESE </p><p>COUNTRIES, WITH PORT AND ROAD CAPACITY ASSESSMENTS </p><p>FINALIZED, AND STANDBY TRANSPORT CAPACITY NEGOTIATED. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4022 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01220  05 OF 05  241312Z </p><p>ACTION AID-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  INL-00   USNW-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  UTED-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00   NEA-00   DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OES-00   OIC-02   IRM-00   TEST-00  TRSE-00 </p><p>      SA-00    EPAE-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------499DE5  241312Z /38 </p><p>P 241304Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8895 </p><p>INFO EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY AMMAN </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY DAMASCUS </p><p>AMEMBASSY KUWAIT </p><p>AMEMBASSY NICOSIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY CANBERRA </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 3173 </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 05 OF 05 ROME 001220 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01220  05 OF 05  241312Z </p><p> </p><p>FROM U.S. MISSION IN ROME </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR A/S PRM DEWEY, IO A/S HOLMES, EUR/NE, EUR/WE, </p><p>SA/INS, IO/EDA SWINNICK </p><p>USDA/FAS FOR U/S PENN, MCHAMBLISS AND RTILSWORTH </p><p>USAID FOR ADMINISTRATOR NATSIOS, AA/DCHA WINTER, D/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>BMCCONNELL, D/DCHA/FFP LANDIS </p><p>JOINT STAFF FOR JE/J4/J5 </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR USEU </p><p>NSC FOR JDWORKEN </p><p>USUN FOR AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE AND MLUTZ </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:     EAID, AORC, UN, PREF, EAGR, ECON, KUNR, WFP </p><p>SUBJECT: WFP TO LAUNCH IRAQ REGIONAL EMERGENCY OPERATION FOR </p><p>2003 - USD 1.23 BILLION </p><p> </p><p>21.
