<p>S E C R E T DAMASCUS 01746 </p><p> </p><p>TERREP EXCLUSIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER </p><p>SUBJECT:  CHANGES IN ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AN AMERICAN JOURNALIST (STRICTLY PROTECT) WITH WELL- </p><p>ESTABLISHED CONTACTS IN AMMAN AND DAMASCUS WITH DFLP AND </p><p>PFLP PERSONALITIES HAS BEEN TOLD BY HIS PALESTINIAN </p><p>SOURCES THAT THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION HAS OFFERED TO </p><p>MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN ITS ACTIVITIES.  THE OFFER </p><p>WAS EXTENDED DURING THE TALKS WITH QADHAFI AND THE </p><p>OTHER FIVE PALESTINIAN FACTIONS REPRESENTED AT THE </p><p>RECENT TRIPOLI CONFERENCE.  IN ORDER TO GAIN PARTICIPA- </p><p>TION AT THE UPCOMING ALGIERS PNC, ACCORDING TO PFLP AND </p><p>DFLP SOURCES HERE, ANO NUMBER TWO ATIF ABU BAKR AGREED </p><p>THAT HIS ORGANIZATION WOULD ADHERE IN THE FUTURE TO THE </p><p>1979 PLO DECISION FORBIDDING ARMED ACTIONS OUTSIDE THE </p><p>OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE DFLP AND PFLP OFFICIALS WHO PROVIDED THIS </p><p>INFORMATION STATED THAT THERE HAS BEEN FOR SOMETIME A </p><p>DEBATE GOING ON AMONG THE ANO LEADERSHIP AS TO ITS FUTURE </p><p>COURSE OF ACTION.  THEY FEAR THAT THE SARG, BOTH BECAUSE </p><p>OF WESTERN PRESSURES AND ITS OWN POLICIES, WILL INCREAS- </p><p>INGLY RESTRICT ANO OPERATIONS BASED IN SYRIA AND LEBANON, </p><p>AND THAT, IF EXPELLED FROM THESE SANCTUARIES, THEY WILL B </p><p>HARD PRESSED TO FIND A SATISFACTORY BASE OF OPERATIONS. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE ADVOCATING A CHANGE IN STRATEGY </p><p>HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE REPUTATION AMONG PALESTINIAN </p><p>YOUTHS THAT THEY HAVE GAINED THROUGH TAKING ONE OF THE </p><p>MOST ACTIVE ROLES IN THE DEFENSE OF THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>CAMPS AGAINST THE AMAL MOVEMENT.  THIS GROUP, REPORTEDLY </p><p>LED BY ATIF ABU BAKR, SUPPOSEDLY HAS DECIDED TO ADOPT </p><p>A MORE MODERATE ROLE IN ORDER TO GAIN POLITICAL RESPECTA- </p><p>BILITY AND REASSERT ITSELF DIRECTLY IN PALESTINIAN </p><p>COUNCILS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  A SMALLER, DIE-HARD FACTION, HOWEVER, REMAINS </p><p>COMMITTED TO AN ACTIVE INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ROLE.  NO </p><p>MATTER WHAT THE REST OF THE ORGANIZATION DOES, IT WILL </p><p>CONTINUE THEIR ACTIVITIES ALBEIT, PERHAPS, WITHOUT ALL OF </p><p>THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE NOW TO THE ANO.  THE BOTTOM LINE </p><p>IS, OF COURSE, THAT WE WILL STILL HAVE AN ANO EVEN IF IT </p><p>OPERATES UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE JOURNALIST SAYS THAT HIS PLFP CONTACTS INSIST </p><p>THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS CLOSED DOWN THE ABU NIDAL </p><p>OFFICES IN DAMASCUS AND EXPELLED ITS OFFICIALS FROM SYRIA </p><p>THE DFLP CONTACTS ON THE OTHER HAND SAY THAT THE ANO </p><p>OFFICES ARE OPEN BUT THAT ABU NIDAL PERSONNEL ARE </p><p>COMPLETELY RESTRICTED IN THEIR MOVEMENTS BY THE SYRIAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  ALL OF THE DAMASCUS PALESTINIANS </p><p>AGREE THAT WITHIN THE CAMPS IN LEBANON AND SYRIA TODAY </p><p>THE ANO ENJOYS PERHAPS GREATER PRESTIGE THAN ANY OTHER </p><p>PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATION AMONG THE YOUNGER GENERATION -- </p><p>WHAT THEY CALL THE SABRA/SHATILLA GENERATION.  ACCORDING </p><p>TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE "ONLY THE ANO IS DOING ANYTHING." </p><p>THE JOURNALIST SAYS THAT THIS IS A FACT REFLECTED IN HIS </p><p>OWN EXPERIENCES IN AMMAN WHERE THE CHILDREN OF HIS MIDDLE </p><p>CLASS PALESTINIAN FRIENDS VOCIFERIOUSLY SUPPORT ABU NIDAL </p><p>IN THE FACE OF THEIR MODERATE PARENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  WHILE SOME OF THE LOGIC OF THE ARGUMENT </p><p>THAT THE ANO MUST CHANGE ITS STRIPES OR RISK LOSING ITS </p><p>SANCTUARIES MAKES SENSE, FROM EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT </p><p>THE ANO, WE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT ATIF ABU </p><p>BAKR OR ANY OTHER LEADER IS WILLING TO ESCHEW </p><p>TERRORISM AGAINST ARABS AND OTHERS OUTSIDE ISRAEL AND </p><p>THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  WE HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN </p><p>OUR SOURCE, HOWEVER, AS HE IS AN ACCURATE AND EXPERIENCED </p><p>REPORTER WITH VERY GOOD TIES IN PALESTINIAN CIRCLES </p><p>AND CANNOT DISMISS HIS REPORT OUT OF HAND.  FURTHERMORE, </p><p>ANO -  IF IT THOUGHT IT FACED A LOSS OF ITS SYRIAN BASE - </p><p>MIGHT GO QUITE FAR TO KEEP ONE IN LIBYA AND ESTABLISH </p><p>ITS PALESTINIAN CREDENTIALS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO </p><p>EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO FOLLOW UP.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  DEPARTMENT SHOULD RETRANSMIT TO OTHER POSTS AS </p><p>APPROPRIATE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RANSOM </p><p></p></div>
