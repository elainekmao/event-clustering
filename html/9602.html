Wahba for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.(C) Senior Advisor Walter Slocombe and UAE Chief of Staff </p><p>Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan (MBZ) discussed the current </p><p>situation in Iraq and the workings of the governing council. </p><p>Mr. Slocombe reassured MBZ that the U.S. was committed to </p><p>rebuilding Iraq and to stay for the "long haul."  They discussed </p><p>the role of the UN and the international community in Iraq.  MBZ </p><p>was especially interested in the steps the coalition was taking </p><p>to restore security in Iraq and gave suggestions on how to seek </p><p>out "untainted" officers for the military.  He also raised the </p><p>Iranian threat and discussed how the coalition could deal with </p><p>the threat of Sunni and Shia extremism.  Mr. Slocombe gave an </p><p>interview to Abu Dhabi TV where he had the opportunity to </p><p>explain coalition activities in Iraq and the Iraq Governing </p><p>Council to a wider Arab audience.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE SECURITY SITUATION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Senior Advisor Slocombe, Ambassador Wahba, and DAS John </p><p>Scott Carpenter met with UAE Chief of Staff Lt. General Sheikh </p><p>Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan (MBZ) on July 23 to discuss current </p><p>developments in Iraq and the efforts of the Coalition </p><p>Provisional Authority (CPA) and the Iraq Governing Council (GC). </p><p>MBZ was very interested in the current security situation in </p><p>Iraq.  He asked whether the U.S had any evidence of foreign </p><p>participation in the attacks against coalition forces, and if </p><p>so, whether the foreigners had ties to Al-Qaeda.  Mr. Slocombe </p><p>explained that the coalition had no clear evidence of foreign </p><p>involvement in the post-war attacks.  He said that we believed </p><p>that most of the attacks were carried out by either Saddam\'s old </p><p>security forces or for pay.  He noted that, in a country where a </p><p>good monthly wage was USD $200, people were being paid $1,500 to </p><p>attack coalition troops. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) They discussed the Iranian threat to Iraqi stability. </p><p>MBZ said that he thought that the Iranians had a long-term and a </p><p>short-term strategy.   In the near term, he said that the </p><p>Iranians would provoke the Sunnis against the coalition </p><p>presence.  Their long-term strategy is to fully infiltrate and </p><p>build closer relations with Iraqi Shia.  He also advised Mr. </p><p>Slocombe that the best way for the coalition to co-opt the Shia </p><p>was to encourage them to think of themselves as Iraqis with </p><p>religious roots in Karbala not in Qom.  He noted that the </p><p>Iranians are working hard to convince the Shia to view the </p><p>Americans as invaders and present themselves as powerful allies </p><p>against the US.  DAS Carpenter noted that Iran was spending a </p><p>lot of money to build up support among the Iraqi Shia, but that </p><p>its money was not buying strong, widespread support. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) MBZ was interested in the steps that the CPA was taking </p><p>to rebuild security in Iraq.  He was pleased to hear that the </p><p>Iraqis are starting to take a more active role in maintaining </p><p>their own security.  (There are already approximately 35,000 </p><p>Iraqi police and plans to hire another 30,000.)  He was also </p><p>impressed by the plan to build three Iraqi divisions in three </p><p>years.  He suggested that it would be useful if the CPA could </p><p>convince Arab states (specifically mentioning Morocco and </p><p>Tunisia i.e. outside of the ME and GCC) to provide military </p><p>forces.  The participation of an Arab state, even in a "quiet </p><p>sector of Iraq" would encourage non-Arab countries to take a </p><p>more positive and active role in stabilizing Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>REBUILDING THE MILITARY </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) MBZ, in response to a question from Mr. Slocombe, </p><p>suggested how the CPA could find good military officers that </p><p>were not tainted by association with Saddam.  First, he said </p><p>that the coalition should "look to the north" since 70% of the </p><p>officer corps came from the Sunni tribes in the north.  If the </p><p>coalition wanted an officer corps of 30-40% Sunni, he said, it </p><p>needed to look in the area of greatest concentration.  Secondly, </p><p>he recommended that the coalition look for 2-3 good senior </p><p>officers - division or corps commanders or deputies - who had </p><p>been purged by Saddam "a long time ago."  They would be able to </p><p>find good junior and mid-level officers.  MBZ specifically </p><p>suggested that the coalition consider the governor of Mosul, </p><p>Ghanim Bessou who was a respected officer in the Iraqi military </p><p>and would know many others who were purged by Saddam. He told </p><p>Mr. Slocombe that in a recent conversation with him Ghanim spoke </p><p>very highly of the U.S. military forces and the level of </p><p>cooperation he enjoyed with them. </p><p>DEALING WITH RELIGION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The group also discussed the impact of religion in Iraq </p><p>and shared concerns about the efforts of religious groups to </p><p>take over the government\'s role in providing social services and </p><p>to dominate civil society. MBZ noted that it didn\'t matter how </p><p>balanced the governing council was if the religious extremists </p><p>dominated the society.  He also suggested that the CPA increase </p><p>its outreach efforts to religious leaders, noting that an Imam </p><p>could turn from a "nice guy" to a "Wahabi" overnight if he had a </p><p>reason.  He suggested that the U.S. bring in U.S. Muslim groups </p><p>to reach out to the Iraqi religious community by meeting with </p><p>clerics and attending Friday prayers etc.  He said that, if it </p><p>were him, he would monitor the Friday sermons continuously and </p><p>put the Imams on the payroll of a Muslim organization "I could </p><p>trust."  He noted that if the Imams were well salaried, they </p><p>would be less vulnerable to shifting loyalties.  MBZ then </p><p>suggested that the GC limit the number of new mosques through </p><p>building permits and designate those that could offer the main </p><p>Friday prayer sermons.  Only A-list mosques above a certain size </p><p>should have Friday prayer.  The rest would be open for regular </p><p>prayer.  (Note:  This would obviously facilitate monitoring of </p><p>the Friday sermons and limit large crowds to a designated number </p><p>of mosques. End note.)  He also gave a telling example of how </p><p>the UAE limits numbers and maintains supervision over mosques. </p><p>He said that the UAE was building a new housing complex of 3500 </p><p>homes.  When the government looked at the site, it found 46 </p><p>sites designated for mosques and worried that there was no way </p><p>to monitor that many mosques in one neighborhood.  The UAEG came </p><p>up with a religiously sanctioned answer by noting the saying </p><p>that "he who walks further to a mosque is more blessed" and </p><p>decreed that there would be a minimum distance of 1000 meters </p><p>between mosques. </p><p> </p><p>MEDIA OUTREACH </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. Mr. Slocombe also gave a brief interview to Abu Dhabi </p><p>television on the situation in Iraq.  Abu Dhabi TV is the second </p><p>most watched Arab television station behind Al-Jazeera.  This </p><p>was an important opportunity to reach out to a larger Arab </p><p>audience with our message on the situation in Iraq and on </p><p>coalition efforts there. </p><p> </p><p>ATTENDEES </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Other attendees at the meeting included MG Obaid and the </p><p>Director of the Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and </p><p>Research on the UAE side and the Defense Attach  the Chief of </p><p>the US Liaison Office, and Mr. Slocombe\'s military advisor on </p><p>the U.S. side. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C)  This visit was a very useful opportunity for the CPA to </p><p>discuss policy issues and to describe the situation on the </p><p>ground to a senior UAE official. The UAE leadership is very well </p><p>informed about events in Iraq, through their robust humanitarian </p><p>and reconstruction assistance there. While some of his comments </p><p>reflected UAE specific concerns, MBZ\'s recommendations and ideas </p><p>reflect his strategic thinking on the broader challenges of </p><p>stabilizing Iraq and the region. End Comment </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) This cable has been cleared by Senior Advisor Slocombe. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
