<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 003842 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/13/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: ARTICLE 98: GOT SAYS IT SUPPORTS AGREEMENT IN </p><p>PRINCIPLE, BUT WARY OF EU PRESSURE </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: GOT officials told a visiting State and </p><p>Defense Article 98 delegation June 10 that the GOT in </p><p>principle favors reaching an Article 98 agreement with the </p><p>US, but cannot do so at this time because of intense EU </p><p>pressure.  The officials noted that Turkey is not a signatory </p><p>to the International Criminal Court (ICC), and said the GOT </p><p>would not turn Americans over to the ICC.  The delegation </p><p>members noted that the EU had encouraged the US to reach </p><p>Article 98 agreements, and said the US is seeking fair </p><p>treatment, not impunity for war crimes.  They said the fact </p><p>that the US has reached Article 98 agreements with 42 </p><p>countries indicates the EU view is not universal.  They </p><p>argued that EU pressure will only increase as Turkey\'s EU </p><p>candidacy advances.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>EU Pressure Puts Turkey in "Awkward Position" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Daryal Batibay, Director General of the MFA Department </p><p>of Multilateral Political Affairs, and Tunc Ugdul, Batibay\'s </p><p>deputy, told Patricia McNerney, T Senior Advisor, and Col. Al </p><p>Ringgenberg, DOD/GC, that Turkey, as an EU candidate country, </p><p>is under high-level EU pressure not to sign an Article 98 </p><p>agreement with the US that violates the EU\'s September 2002 </p><p>Guiding Principles.  In May, they said, the EU sent a letter </p><p>to all candidate countries co-signed by EU Enlargement </p><p>Commissioner Verheugen and Greek FM Papandreou (in his </p><p>capacity as EU Council Chairman) "strongly recommending" </p><p>against such agreements.  Batibay said this put Turkey in an </p><p>"awkward position," because the Guiding Principles appear to </p><p>be a non-starter for the US.  McNerney said the Guiding </p><p>Principles are contradictory in parts and too narrow in scope </p><p>-- they would cover only Amcit military personnel directly </p><p>involved in a mission.  She said the Principles represent a </p><p>unilateral EU interpretation of the Rome Statute -- the fact </p><p>that the US has reached Article 98 agreements with 42 </p><p>countries, including a number of ICC members, indicates the </p><p>EU view is not universal.  Ringgenberg said that, due to the </p><p>efforts of some EU states, the Principles were designed to </p><p>make it as difficult as possible to reach Article 98 </p><p>agreements.  Nevertheless, the US is making progress with a </p><p>number of EU states that are sympathetic to the US view, he </p><p>said. He noted it was the EU that suggested the US pursue </p><p>Article 98 agreements.  McNerney said the US position has </p><p>been distorted; we are not seeking impunity for our citizens, </p><p>only for agreements preventing our personnel from being </p><p>surrendered to a Court to which the US does not belong.  She </p><p>said the US can prosecute any crime in the Rome Statute under </p><p>its domestic laws, and has a strong record of prosecuting war </p><p>crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>GOT: We Would Not Surrender Americans to ICC </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Batibay said the GOT would like to reach an Article 98 </p><p>agreement with the US, particularly in light of recent </p><p>tensions in the US-Turkey relationship.  Ugdul added that the </p><p>GOT agreed in principle with the US position on the ICC. </p><p>Sovereign nations should be primarily responsible for trying </p><p>war crimes suspects; the ICC should play only a supplementary </p><p>role, he said.  Unfortunately, however, the US position is </p><p>being distorted, especially in Europe, and has emerged as a </p><p>political controversy, he said.  The timing is not right for </p><p>Turkey to sign an agreement, he averred.  Batibay agreed, </p><p>suggesting that the GOT might be able to reach an Article 98 </p><p>agreement after the June 25 US-EU summit, provided the US and </p><p>EU can work out their differences on the issue.  In the </p><p>meantime, Batibay argued, an Article 98 agreement should not </p><p>be an urgent US-Turkey bilateral issue.  Unlike the other EU </p><p>candidate countries, Turkey is not a signatory to the ICC and </p><p>therefore is under no obligations to turn suspects over to </p><p>the Court, he noted.  As a NATO member and close US ally, the </p><p>GOT would not turn over Americans to the ICC, he said. </p><p>Batibay said Turkey will eventually have to join the ICC </p><p>before becoming a full EU member, but that is years away. </p><p>Ringgenberg said he understands the GOT is under pressure </p><p>from the EU.  However, he argued, this is the time to reach </p><p>an Article 98 agreement, because EU pressure will only </p><p>increase as Turkey\'s EU candidacy progresses.  Ringgenberg </p><p>suggested Turkey might be able to follow an approach pursued </p><p>by the Philippines, which in May reached an Article 98 </p><p>agreement with the US and at the same time announced its </p><p>intention to join the ICC.  Batibay said the GOT will </p><p>consider that approach. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
