<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001072 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR P, EUR, EUR/SE, NEA AND NEA/NGA; </p><p>NSC FOR AMB. KHALILZAD; </p><p>OSD FOR USDP LUTI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, PREF, PHUM, TU, IZ, UNSC, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTHERN IRAQ: TURKS, KDP, PUK AND ITF HOLD </p><p>"COORDINATION" MEETING IN SILOPI FEB. 17 - KURDS COMPLAIN </p><p>ABOUT TURKISH INTERVENTION PLAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S/NF) TGS and Turkish MFA reps discussed in general terms </p><p>with KDP, PUK and ITF reps Turkish plans and intentions to </p><p>coordinate deployment in northern Iraq with the Iraqi Kurdish </p><p>and Turcoman parties at a meeting in Silopi, on the </p><p>Turkish-Iraqi border Feb. 17.  The Iraqi Kurds told the Turks </p><p>they did not see a need for the planned Turkish deployment. </p><p>According to the Kurds, the Turkish side was not happy with </p><p>the response from the KDP and the PUK to their presentation, </p><p>although the sides agreed to a follow-up meeting that will </p><p>get into technical details in Salahadeen Feb. 25 or 26.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S/NF)KDP Ankara rep Safeen Dizayee contacted Operation </p><p>Northern Watch POLAD Feb. 17 to report on a just-concluded </p><p>meeting in Silopi between KDP, PUK, and Iraqi Turkmen Front </p><p>(ITF) reps and representatives of the Turkish General Staff </p><p>to coordinate military plans in an eventual Iraq operation. </p><p>PUK Ankara rep also provided a brief to ONW POLAD Feb. 18. </p><p>Attending for the KDP were "Deputy PM" Sami Abdul Rahman, </p><p>Politburo member Fadhil Merani, Dohuk region peshmerga </p><p>commander Babakir Zebari and Dizayee.  The PUK was </p><p>represented by PUK leader Jalal Talabani and former "Deputy </p><p>PM" and current PUK Irbil Office rep Adnan Mufti.  ITF was </p><p>represented by Chairman Sanan Aga (who arrived in a </p><p>helicopter, to the chagrin of the KDP and PUK reps).  (NOTE: </p><p>Turkish press insistently claimed, despite our denials, that </p><p>a US "general" also participated.)  The TGS emphasized the </p><p>need for logistical coordination to prepare for a </p><p>humanitarian emergency.  The 2/17 meeting only discussed </p><p>generalities.  The TGS offered a follow-up meeting 2/24 or </p><p>2/25 probably in Salahadeen to get into technical details. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) According to Dizayee, the Kurdish side repeated the </p><p>familiar points that they did not envision an exodus as in </p><p>1991, and if a displaced persons emergency did come about, </p><p>the Kurds would actively seek Turkish assistance.  But until </p><p>such a time, the Iraqi Kurds did not see a need for Turkish </p><p>military intervention, which, the Kurds asserted, would draw </p><p>in other regional powers.  The Turks responded that they also </p><p>did not foresee a mass exodus, but based on their 1991 </p><p>experience, they had to be prepared for the worst.  The ITF </p><p>used the meeting to complain about opposition conference </p><p>issues and demanded inclusion in the conference preparatory </p><p>committee.  The KDP and the PUK said this meeting was the </p><p>wrong forum for opposition conference discussions and </p><p>declined to take up the issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S/NF)  The issue of the ITF security officer arrested by </p><p>the KDP on terrorism charges was raised by the Turkish side. </p><p>The KDP stressed that the case was about an individual, and </p><p>was not part of a political vendetta against the ITF.  The </p><p>KDP told the Turks that they had evidence against the </p><p>individual in question showing he was working for "someone </p><p>else."  Dizayee added that the Turkish liaison in Irbil has </p><p>been to see the KDP leadership a few times and claims he has </p><p>a copy of a US report on the matter.  According to Dizayee, </p><p>the Turks asserted that the US agreed with Turkey that this </p><p>was a political act against the ITF. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S/NF) Galali said he had spoken by phone with his TGS </p><p>point of contact in Silopi, Itaz Pasha, who attended the </p><p>meeting.  Itaz Pasha told Galali the Turks were unhappy with </p><p>the results of the meeting and that this was the first time </p><p>in recent exchanges Turkey has been unhappy with Jalal </p><p>Talabani.  Talabani apparently told the Turks that not only </p><p>the Iranians, Syrians and Iraqi Arabs would oppose a Turkish </p><p>intervention in northern Iraq, but so would the Iraqi Kurdish </p><p>community.  Itaz Pasha said to Galali, "Tell Mam Jalal that </p><p>like Nelson Mandela, who worked hard for his country but </p><p>today is reduced to travelling around and giving lectures, if </p><p>Talabani adopts Barzani\'s attitude, he too will become like </p><p>Mandela, with no role."  When Itaz Pasha told Galali the </p><p>Turks only wanted to stop refugees from coming into Turkey, </p><p>Galali asked what the TGS would do if it got a call from </p><p>Sanan Aga to come help the ITF in Irbil.  Itaz Pasha replied </p><p>that the Turks would go to Irbil, as they would if Talabani </p><p>asked for help in Sulaymaniyah.  Galali told him that was why </p><p>the Iraqi Kurds opposed Turkish intervention and that a TGS </p><p>move to aid the ITF in Irbil would lead to chaos, to which </p><p>Itaz Pasha reportedly said "if a war starts, we will come </p><p>into the whole region and no one can stop us." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S/NF) Galali said to us, "the Turks want to make camps in </p><p>Iraq and send large numbers of troops.  They tell us they </p><p>want to cooperate with us, but if they send in 50,000 troops, </p><p>how can we stop them from doing what they want whether we </p><p>"cooperate" or not?  Why do they need tens of thousands of </p><p>troops in our area if they are not even participating in the </p><p>war against Saddam?"  Galali urged the US to tell the Turks </p><p>that the US did not need Turkish forces in northern Iraq. </p><p>Noting that the Turks needed to come to the US to get KDP and </p><p>PUK agreement to Turkish deployments in the north, he pleaded </p><p>"please tell them no."  He said that if the Turks decide not </p><p>to support a US operation, the US should send quickly as much </p><p>military force as possible to Harir and Sulaymaniyah by air </p><p>to show the Turks that the US can operate in northern Iraq </p><p>without Turkey\'s approval.   Galali said, "Every Iraqi Kurd </p><p>is unhappy about the prospect of a Turkish intervention, even </p><p>the PUK.  We know we cannot stop the Turks because the US is </p><p>trying to cooperate with them.  But Turkey must accept our </p><p>rights as the residents of the region.  The Turks now say </p><p>they have the key to the door in northern Iraq and will </p><p>decide who comes and goes.  You must show them you can do </p><p>things in northern Iraq without them.  They do not understand </p><p>your diplomatic language.  They understand power." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
