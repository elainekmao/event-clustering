<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001330 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  07-30-13 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  Tigers say report on plan to vacate base is </p><p>false, but contacts see thaw in their hard-line stance </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) FBIS Reston Va DTG 300259Z Jul 03 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) FBIS Reston Va DTG 300245Z Jul 03 </p><p>-      (C) SA/INS-Colombo 07-30-03 class e-mail sequence </p><p>-      (D) Colombo 1325, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by James F. Entwistle, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The Tigers have denied a press report </p><p>that they plan to vacate a new forward base in the east. </p><p>The monitors, who have ruled the base violates the </p><p>ceasefire accord, say they no indication that the group </p><p>is vacating the site; GoN facilitators are looking into </p><p>the matter.  Nonetheless, pro-Tiger MPs have told us </p><p>that they think the group may vacate the site soon. </p><p>While the Tigers are extremely unpredictable, we would </p><p>be surprised if they pushed this matter much further. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) DENIAL OF TV REPORT:  The Liberation Tigers of </p><p>Tamil Eelam (LTTE) organization has flatly denied that </p><p>it plans to vacate a forward base it has established </p><p>near the town of Trincomalee in eastern Sri Lanka. </p><p>(Note:  For further details re the controversy over the </p><p>base, which, confusingly, is variously referred to as </p><p>the "Kinniya," "Wan Ela," "Manrasakulam," and </p><p>"Kurankupanchan" camp -- see Ref D.)  The denial, which </p><p>was posted on "TamilNet," the pro-LTTE website on </p><p>July 30, was in response to a news report carried late </p><p>July 29 on the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation </p><p>(SLBC).  (Note:  The SLBC report was also carried by the </p><p>DAILY NEWS, a major English-language newspaper, on </p><p>July 30.) In the report, the SLBC said LTTE Political </p><p>Chief S.P. Thamilchelvam had traveled to the Trincomalee </p><p>area to discuss the issue with LTTE cadre after ordering </p><p>the full dismantlement of the base within the next 72 </p><p>hours.  In its denial, TamilNet also quoted the LTTE\'s </p><p>area commanders as stating that Thamilchelvam had not in </p><p>fact visited the Trincomalee area on July 29. </p><p>(Note:  In a rare foray away from the LTTE-occupied </p><p>Wanni region, Thamilchelvam has been visiting the </p><p>Batticaloa area the past several days.  It seems likely </p><p>that he may stop in Trincomalee today, July 30, based on </p><p>what we are hearing.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MONITORS CANNOT CONFIRM LTTE PLANS:  For its </p><p>part, the Norwegian-run Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission </p><p>(SLMM), which recently ruled that the LTTE\'s base had </p><p>been established in violation of the February 2002 </p><p>ceasefire accord, said it had received no word from the </p><p>group re its plans for the base.  Kurt Spur, Acting </p><p>Chief of the SLMM\'s Trincomalee office, told us that as </p><p>of mid-day July 30 the LTTE base was still there and </p><p>there were no signs of that it was being dismantled. </p><p>In a conversation with poloff, Hagrup Haukland, the </p><p>SLMM\'s Colombo-based Deputy Chief, said the monitors </p><p>continue to try to "reach out" to the LTTE on the issue, </p><p>but the group "is not reciprocating."  As he has stated </p><p>to the press on numerous occasions of late, Haukland </p><p>went on to remark that the LTTE\'s failure to vacate the </p><p>base promptly could lead the SLMM to "reconsider how it </p><p>does business."  When pressed by polchief re this </p><p>seeming threat, Haukland replied that the SLMM had no </p><p>plans to take any sort of drastic action over the issue, </p><p>such as withdrawing from Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The Norwegian government facilitators are also </p><p>looking into the situation.  Norwegian Ambassador Hans </p><p>Brattskar told the Charge that he could not confirm the </p><p>SLBC report that the Tigers had decided to vacate the </p><p>base.  He said he would look into the veracity of the </p><p>report (see Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) LTTE RELAXING STANCE?:  On the other hand, two </p><p>Tamil politicians with close links to the LTTE have told </p><p>us that they have heard that the group may be </p><p>reconsidering its stance on the base.  Joseph </p><p>Pararajahsingham and Gajan Ponnambalam, Tamil National </p><p>Alliance (TNA) MPs, told us that they had heard that the </p><p>LTTE planned to withdraw from the base in the next </p><p>several days.  Ponnambalam said the group was just </p><p>trying to "make a point" via its establishment of the </p><p>base, not undermine the peace process.  (Note:  Suiting </p><p>the opaque ways of the LTTE and its supporters, </p><p>Ponnambalam was vague on what this "point" might be.) </p><p>Pararajahsingham said the group certainly did not want </p><p>to provoke any sort of armed confrontation with the </p><p>government over the issue.  Polchief underscored to both </p><p>TNA MPs that, in the interest of the peace process, it </p><p>was absolutely vital that both parties fully honor the </p><p>rulings of the SLMM. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) (((Note:  Re the GSL\'s stance on this matter, </p><p>there is no indication thus far that the government is </p><p>planning any sort of military action meant to force the </p><p>LTTE from the base.  In public, the government has </p><p>sought to downplay the situation, seemingly going to </p><p>lengths not to ramp up the pressure on the LTTE.  In </p><p>private, however, the GSL has underlined that it wants </p><p>the matter resolved as soon as possible -- see Ref C. </p><p>End Note.))) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT:  While the Tigers are very, very </p><p>unpredictable, we would be surprised if they pushed this </p><p>matter much further.  Based on our soundings, the group </p><p>seems to be getting the message that its new base in the </p><p>east has harmed its relationship with the SLMM and </p><p>potentially courts some sort of armed confrontation with </p><p>the GSL.  If the Tigers do throw in their cards, it will </p><p>fit into their tactical style of trying to push the </p><p>envelope as far as it goes only to retreat in the face </p><p>of resistance.  All that said, the group\'s leadership is </p><p>mercurial to say the least and, although the base has no </p><p>apparent strategic value, it is possible the LTTE sees </p><p>some sort of obscure symbolic value in holding it.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
