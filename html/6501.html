<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 001724 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB/CBED, EB/ESC, EUR/SE </p><p>STATE PASS NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p>USDOE FOR PUMPHREY/ROSSI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ENRG, ECON, EPET, AJ, GG, KZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: CBED AMBASSADOR MANN\'S MARCH 12 VISIT TO ANKARA </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1448 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Econ Couns Scot Marciel, Reason 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  During CBED Ambassador Mann,s March 12 </p><p>visit to Ankara, MFA and Ministry of Energy officials </p><p>requested his intervention with the World Bank on the </p><p>negative pledge clause issue (reftel) and with Greece on the </p><p>Interconnector Turkey-Greece (ITG).  MFA Deputy U/S Kilic </p><p>also pressed for Ambassador Mann,s assistance in making </p><p>progress on the Balkan export route for Caspian gas to </p><p>Europe, suggesting a Turkey-Greece-U.S. meeting on this issue </p><p>on the margins of an April 3-4 conference in Istanbul.  In </p><p>meetings with MFA and Ministry of Energy Officials, as well </p><p>as with the President and Prime Minister,s advisors, </p><p>Ambassador Mann emphasized that BOTAS needed sufficient </p><p>authority to meet its obligations under the BTC turnkey </p><p>contract.  Ambassador Mann,s interlocutors uniformly </p><p>responded that they were aware of this issue and were working </p><p>to resolve it.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GOT Request for Help:  TPAO, Greece Connection </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a cordial, one-hour meeting on March 12, Ministry </p><p>of Energy Deputy U/S Nermin Berki and MFA Deputy Director </p><p>General Hakki Akil thanked Ambassador Mann for his continued </p><p>work toward the realization of the East West Energy Corridor. </p><p> Berki noted that February 2003 had been an important month </p><p>-- BTC had reached the "point of no return," the Shah Deniz </p><p>project had been sanctioned, and, on February 23, Turkey and </p><p>Greece had signed the Intergovernmental Agreement for the </p><p>Interconnector Turkey-Greece (ITG).  Berki and Akil asked for </p><p>Ambassador Mann,s assistance on two issues:  with the World </p><p>Bank on applicability of the negative pledge clause to TPAO </p><p>(reftel) and with Greece on the ITG. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Berki said the World Bank,s negative pledge clause, </p><p>which prohibits TPAO from pledging its potential future </p><p>revenues in order to secure financing, presented a real </p><p>problem for the GOT.  She said the World Bank had not yet </p><p>responded to the GOT,s request for a waiver of the clause, </p><p>but indications were that the waiver would be denied.  Berki </p><p>said the GOT would appreciate Amb. Mann\'s support with the </p><p>World Bank on this issue.  Amb. Mann responded that he could </p><p>not provide the formal USG position on a TPAO waiver without </p><p>further discussing the issue in Washington; however, he would </p><p>look into all the available options for TPAO with an eye </p><p>toward finding a positive way forward.  Mann also encouraged </p><p>the Ministry of Energy to send an expert team to Washington </p><p>to discuss TPAO,s alternatives directly with the World Bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Caspian Gas to Europe and the ITG </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On the Interconnector Turkey-Greece, Berki and Akil </p><p>requested that Ambassador Mann intervene directly with the </p><p>Greeks (DEPA) to 1) urge them to conclude the sales purchase </p><p>agreement with BOTAS as soon as possible; and 2) urge more </p><p>flexibility on price.  Akil noted that BOTAS was willing to </p><p>make concessions by not charging a transit tariff, but BOTAS </p><p>could not charge less than what it was paying for Shah Deniz </p><p>-- its cheapest -- gas.  He added that what Gazprom was </p><p>currently charging DEPA was not a "real price," and was </p><p>designed by Russia to undercut the East-West Energy Corridor. </p><p> Russia,s recent attempt to increase the volumes in its </p><p>Western lines into Europe was another concrete sign of its </p><p>policy to undercut Caspian gas.  Akil said the GOT was trying </p><p>to urge Greece to "think strategically" about its gas policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Ambassador Mann responded that he understood both the </p><p>Greek and Turkish positions on this issue -- Greece,s </p><p>Gazprom contracts were indeed cheaper than what BOTAS was </p><p>offering, but it was difficult for BOTAS to charge less than </p><p>the Shah Deniz price.  He emphasized that there must be a </p><p>sharing of incentives and risks.  Amb. Mann added that he </p><p>could be more effective on this issue if he were better </p><p>informed about gas pricing policies in Turkey.  Berki agreed </p><p>to try to send a BOTAS representative to Washington to </p><p>discuss these policies with Mann as soon as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) BOTAS General Manager Bildaci, who was unable to meet </p><p>with Ambassador Mann, told econoff March 17 that, in his </p><p>view, the most important ITG issue on which Amb. Mann could </p><p>help was getting DEPA to commit to taking 2-3 bcm of gas </p><p>annually through the ITG, ramping up over several years from </p><p>the 1/2 bcm to which DEPA was currently committed to taking </p><p>(reftel).  Bildaci emphasized to econoff that the volume </p><p>issue was more important than price.  Bildaci added that the </p><p>Russians, latest plan was to transfer the gas Gazprom was </p><p>currently exporting to Turkey through the two Russia West </p><p>pipelines to the Blue Stream pipeline; that way, he said, </p><p>Russia could use the West pipelines to increase its exports </p><p>to Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In a separate meeting, MFA Deputy U/S for Economic </p><p>Affairs Alev Kilic asked for Ambassador Mann,s thoughts on </p><p>"next steps" for exporting Caspian gas through Turkey to </p><p>Europe via the Balkans route.  Kilic emphasized the GOT </p><p>desire that the U.S., working together with Turkey and </p><p>Greece, engage to bring the Balkan countries rapidly and </p><p>concretely into their gas transportation network.  Akil noted </p><p>that the Greek Development Minister Aksi Tsohatzopoulos, who </p><p>could be helpful on this issue, would be attending the </p><p>TURKIOG Oil and Gas Congress in Istanbul April 3-4.  He said </p><p>the MFA had also formally invited Ambassador Mann to speak at </p><p>this conference, and thought this might be a good opportunity </p><p>for a U.S.-Turkey-Greece discussion of next steps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BTC:  Financing and BOTAS </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) In all of his meetings, including with Chief Advisor </p><p>to the Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Presidential Energy </p><p>Advisor Volkan Ediger, MFA Deputy U/S Alev Kilic, and MENR </p><p>Deputy U/S Nermin Berki, Ambassador Mann emphasized the need </p><p>for successful implementation of the BTC contract in Turkey. </p><p>Mann asked each of his interlocutors for their help in </p><p>ensuring that BOTAS had sufficient authority to meet its </p><p>obligations under the BTC turnkey contract.  Davutoglu told </p><p>Amb. Mann that he had discussed the "BOTAS problem" with </p><p>Energy Minister Guler, who was an old fried.  He said he </p><p>would raise the issue again with the Minister, and would do </p><p>his best to fix the problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Berki and Akil told Mann that Bildaci had presented a </p><p>comprehensive explanation of the problem at a recent lunch </p><p>with Foreign Minister Yakis and Energy Minister Guler.  Berki </p><p>said Guler is committed to resolving this issue as soon as </p><p>possible.  Ambassador Kilic also gave his reassurances that </p><p>the GOT was working on a resolution of this issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Kilic and Akil both thanked Amb. Mann for his </p><p>assistance in facilitating the recent </p><p>Turkish-Azeri-Georgian-BP visit to Washington to discuss </p><p>financing.  Both said there were still concerns about the </p><p>delay in finalizing the financing deal.  Ambassador Mann said </p><p>he felt confident that the financing arrangements were in </p><p>good shape.  The IFC had told President Aliyev it would make </p><p>a final decision on financing by September, and Mann believed </p><p>that date would stick. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meetings with Advisors and Parliamentarians </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) In a meeting with Chief Advisor to the Prime Minister </p><p>Ahmet Davutoglu, and lunch with Presidential Energy Advisor </p><p>Volkan Ediger and AK party parliamentarians,  Ambassador Mann </p><p>reviewed U.S. energy policy in the Caspian, noting that </p><p>U.S.-Turkish cooperation had been and would continue to be </p><p>key to the success of this policy.  Davutoglu began a </p><p>spirited discussion of Iraq.  Ambassador Mann strongly </p><p>reaffirmed the need to work positively within the U.N. to </p><p>deal with the threat proposed by the Iraqi regime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Ambassador Mann,s visit was extremely valuable in </p><p>getting the GOT to focus on BOTAS implementation of the BTC </p><p>contract in Turkey.  Mann,s interlocutors seemingly had </p><p>anticipated his raising the issue, and uniformly responded </p><p>that they were aware of the problem and were working to fix </p><p>it.  We note the MFA pressed hard to make progress on the </p><p>Balkan export route, directly requesting USG assistance on </p><p>next steps.  End comment. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
