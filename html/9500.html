<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001358 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, SA/RA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, PTER, NP, U.S-Nepali Relations </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER </p><p>THAPA </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 1138 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary.  In a meeting with Prime Minister Surya </p><p>Bahadur Thapa on July 16, the Ambassador, accompanied by the </p><p>ambassadors of the UK, India, Germany and France and leaders </p><p>of their respective bilateral chambers of commerce, discussed </p><p>their intention to issue a joint statement condemning growing </p><p>extortion demands by Maoists.  The Prime Minister expressed </p><p>gratitude for the ambassadors\' active involvement and </p><p>welcomed issuance of the joint statement.  He said he was </p><p>aware of escalating Maoist extortion, had voiced this concern </p><p>to the Maoists during informal talks, but had to balance his </p><p>government\'s commitment to law enforcement with its interests </p><p>in maintaining a peace dialogue.  Thapa also offered </p><p>reassurance to international companies in Nepal and pledged </p><p>to protect their interests.  The draft joint statement has </p><p>been approved by the chambers and ambassadors, except the </p><p>Indians, who wish to obtain New Delhi\'s approval before </p><p>joining the collective effort.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On July 16 Ambassador Malinowski called on Prime </p><p>Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa with other members of the </p><p>"Industrial Security Group," a collective comprised of the </p><p>ambassadors of the US, UK, India, Germany and France and </p><p>their respective bilateral chambers of commerce.  Chaired by </p><p>the British ambassador, the group was created several years </p><p>ago to share information and work collectively on the threat </p><p>that the Maoist insurgency posed to international businesses </p><p>in Nepal.  The meeting was requested by the ISG to raise with </p><p>the Prime Minister the Group\'s proposed release of a joint </p><p>statement condemning the recent drastic increase in extortion </p><p>by the Maoists against foreign and foreign-connected </p><p>businesses.  Our Embassy originally had raised the initiative </p><p>with the ISG and provided the draft joint statement. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) British Ambassador Bloomfield opened the meeting with </p><p>a quick overview of the activities and goals of the </p><p>Industrial Security Group.  He proceeded to voice serious </p><p>concern over the impact that the insurgency continued to have </p><p>on businesses despite the cease-fire, and expressed the </p><p>Group\'s desire to be helpful.  Ambassador Bloomfield stressed </p><p>that the Maoists were breaking systematically the "code of </p><p>conduct" agreed to by both sides as the basis of the current </p><p>cease-fire.  He reiterated Britain\'s support for the peace </p><p>process and cease-fire, but expressed concern over the </p><p>"dramatic rise" in Maoist exactions.  Ambassador Malinowski </p><p>added that the extortion activities by the Maoists hurt the </p><p>very "fabric of life" in Nepal, affecting not only the </p><p>businesses and the economy, but also humanitarian and </p><p>development groups, schools, NGOs and everyday people. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) German Ambassador Rudiger Lemp expressed concern that </p><p>international businessmen these days are wary of investing in </p><p>Nepal because of continued violence throughout the country. </p><p>He warned the Prime Minister that "capital is mobile," </p><p>businesses are risk-adverse and, therefore, foreign </p><p>businesses operating in Nepal may decide to leave the </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) French Ambassador Claude Ambrosini added that, </p><p>although there were relatively few French joint business </p><p>ventures in Nepal, he supported the joint statement fully. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Indian Ambassador Shyan Saran agreed in full with </p><p>these statements and pledged the Indian government\'s support </p><p>for GON efforts to end extortion.  He said that India has </p><p>many joint ventures in Nepal and a vested interest in seeing </p><p>companies protected.  Saran questioned the Prime Minister on </p><p>what the diplomatic community should tell their businessmen </p><p>to do when confronted by Maoists and what measures were being </p><p>taken to protect them.  In response, Prime Minister Thapa </p><p>pledged to protect the companies, but no specific plan of </p><p>action was discussed. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Representatives of the chambers of commerce spoke </p><p>bitterly about the "enormous and unrealistic amounts" of </p><p>money that the Maoists were demanding from major businesses. </p><p>Managers are threatened with beatings, kidnappings, and </p><p>murders if they do not comply.  In addition to extortion, the </p><p>Maoists are now penetrating the labor unions and pressing </p><p>them to demand untenable pay increases as populist measures. </p><p>Apart from the ethical dilemma that these demands pose, they </p><p>are a serious drain on business morale and threaten to drive </p><p>many companies out of business.  Discussions of leading </p><p>businessmen with Maoist leaders like Mahara indicate that the </p><p>latter see the US and the Royal Nepal Army as their principal </p><p>enemies.  US interests, the chambers believe, may be under </p><p>particular pressure.  The Maoists have made it clear that if </p><p>they decide to break off talks and go back to war, their </p><p>violence will be even worse than before. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Ambassadors presented to the Prime Minister a </p><p>draft of the ISG joint statement condemning Maoist extortion. </p><p> The Ambassador stressed that joint action, rather than </p><p>unilateral action, would be much more effective in pressuring </p><p>the Maoists to stop extorting from foreign businesses. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Prime Minister thanked everyone for their concern. </p><p> He said the GON was aware of the extortion attempts and had </p><p>increased its vigilance.  Extortion, he said, is a violation </p><p>not only of Nepali law but also of the code of conduct and </p><p>may challenge the viability of the state.  When government </p><p>negotiators had voiced their concern to the Maoists during </p><p>informal talks, the Maoists have justified the collections as </p><p>"donations."  The Prime Minister asserted that the Maoists </p><p>are in need of money to finance their return to warfare. </p><p>While he emphasized several times the need to keep the code </p><p>of conduct intact, the Prime Minister said the main goal of </p><p>the GON was two-fold: to keep the peace process moving </p><p>forward while preserving law and order.  The Prime Minister </p><p>disclosed that a high-level Maoist in Kathmandu, holding a </p><p>large sum of money, had been arrested on extortion charges </p><p>and would be prosecuted according to the law.  He welcomed </p><p>the idea of a joint statement and said it would have a </p><p>positive impact.  The Prime Minister reassured the group that </p><p>the Government of Nepal was committed to protecting foreign </p><p>business interests.  He approved a suggestion from a chamber </p><p>leader that a 24/7 command center be created in the Home </p><p>Ministry to coordinate information on extortion attempts and </p><p>oversee appropriate responses. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Comment.  The general consensus at the meeting was </p><p>that Maoist extortion demands are showing no sign of abating </p><p>despite the prohibition of such activity under the cease-fire </p><p>code of conduct.  Extortion demands are targeting companies, </p><p>individuals and associations, and the amounts demanded have </p><p>increased immensely.  It is clear to this Embassy, and all </p><p>the other members of the Industrial Security Group, that the </p><p>GON leadership feels constrained in reacting decisively to </p><p>combat this escalating criminal activity by its concern that </p><p>it not provide the Maoists with an excuse for breaking off </p><p>the peace talks.  All the ambassadors in the ISG are prepared </p><p>to endorse the joint statement against the extortion except </p><p>for the Indian, who wants to obtain New Delhi\'s approval. </p><p>Ambassador Saran has said he is hopeful that his government </p><p>will agree to sign as well.  Post expects a response from the </p><p>Indians soon, but is prepared to issue the statement with </p><p>other ISG members should the Indian government not approve. </p><p>The Prime Minister obviously is grateful for the diplomatic </p><p>community\'s firm public stand.  End Comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
