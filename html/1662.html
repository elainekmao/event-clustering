(U) YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, GENDER AND EMPLOYMENT </p><p>CREATION MINISTER BORDER GEZI WAS KILLED IN AN APRIL 28 </p><p>CAR ACCIDENT ON THE HARARE-MASVINGO ROAD.  GEZI\'S DRIVER </p><p>WAS ALSO KILLED, AND HIS AIDE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED.  A </p><p>TIRE BLOWOUT APPARENTLY CAUSED GEZI\'S OFFICIAL MERCEDES </p><p>TO SWERVE OFF THE HIGHWAY AND INTO A LARGE TREE.  THE </p><p>APRIL 29 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED "SUNDAY </p><p>MAIL" SHOWED GEZI\'S CAR AS A BADLY CRUMPLED WRECK, WITH </p><p>THE LEFT HALF OF THE CAR, WHERE GEZI WAS SEATED, MOSTLY </p><p>SHEARED AWAY.  GEZI HAD BEEN ON HIS WAY TO MASVINGO </p><p>TOWN, WHERE HE WAS DUE TO PRESENT ZIM$1.6 MILLION </p><p>(US$16,000) TO LOCAL OFFICIALS FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS </p><p>(NOTE: A MAYORAL ELECTION IS SCHEDULED IN MASVINGO FOR </p><p>MAY 12-13.  END NOTE.)  PRESIDENT MUGABE SAID A FULL </p><p>POLICE INVESTIGATION WOULD BE CARRIED OUT.  THE APRIL 30 </p><p>EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" SAID </p><p>THE ZANU-PF POLITBURO WOULD MEET TODAY (APRIL 30) TO </p><p>DECIDE WHETHER GEZI WOULD BE GRANTED NATIONAL HERO </p><p>STATUS AND BURIED IN HEROES\' ACRE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE SUDDEN DEATH OF GEZI CREATES A GAPING HOLE, </p><p>NOT ONLY IN CABINET, BUT ALSO IN THE RULING ZANU-PF </p><p>STRUCTURE.  GEZI WAS A POLITBURO MEMBER AND ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>NATIONAL POLITICAL COMMISSAR, AND AS SUCH, WAS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ORGANIZING PARTY ELECTIONS AND HAD LED </p><p>THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE PARTY\'S PROVINCIAL EXECUTIVES. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01470  301345Z </p><p>THE 36-YEAR-OLD MINISTER WAS KNOWN AS ONE OF THE PARTY\'S </p><p>MOST ENERGETIC PROMOTERS, AND HAS BEEN CREDITED WITH </p><p>REJUVENATING THE PARTY AFTER ITS ELECTORAL SETBACKS LAST </p><p>YEAR.  IN HIS PREVIOUS POST AS GOVERNOR OF MASHONALAND </p><p>CENTRAL PROVINCE, GEZI LED THE CAMPAIGN OF TERROR </p><p>AGAINST OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN HIS PROVINCE IN THE </p><p>RUN-UP TO THE JUNE 2000 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) GEZI\'S DEATH WILL ALSO RESULT IN A BY-ELECTION </p><p>FOR HIS BINDURA PARLIAMENTARY SEAT.  THE CONSTITUENCY </p><p>NORTH OF HARARE IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL WAS ONE OF THE </p><p>MOST BRUTALIZED CONSTITUENCIES IN LAST YEAR\'S ELECTION, </p><p>AND OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS ARE STILL ROUTINELY HARASSED </p><p>AND BEATEN THERE.  DESPITE THE VIOLENCE, GEZI WAS </p><p>ELECTED BY A MARGIN OF ONLY 2,000 VOTES, THE ONLY </p><p>MASHONALAND CENTRAL ELECTION WHERE THE MDC CAME EVEN </p><p>REMOTELY CLOSE TO WINNING.  THE BY-ELECTION, WHENEVER IT </p><p>IS HELD, WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE A VIOLENT AND BLOODY ONE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH IT\'S NOT CLEAR WHO WILL FILL </p><p>GEZI\'S SHOES, MT. DARWIN SOUTH MP SAVIOR "TYSON" </p><p>KASUKUWERE APPEARS WELL-POSITIONED FOR THE JOB. </p><p>KASUKUWERE WAS APPOINTED TO THE 30-MEMBER POLITBURO IN </p><p>FEBRUARY THIS YEAR AND GIVEN THE PARTY\'S PORTFOLIO OF </p><p>DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS.  THE YOUTHFUL </p><p>KASUKUWERE HAS A REPUTATION FOR ZEALOUSLY ATTACKING </p><p>PARTY OPPONENTS -- BOTH FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY -- </p><p>AND IS JUST THE SORT OF PERSON MUGABE WOULD PROBABLY </p><p>LIKE TO HAVE AS YOUTH DEVELOPMENT MINISTER.  GEZI IS </p><p>BELIEVED TO HAVE USED MINISTRY RESOURCES FOR </p><p>ESTABLISHING "TRAINING CENTERS" FOR ZANU-PF YOUTH AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01470  301345Z </p><p>OTHER PARTY SUPPORTERS.  ALTHOUGH GEZI\'S DEATH IS A BLOW </p><p>TO THE ZANU-PF ESTABLISHMENT, THERE ARE OTHER YOUNG </p><p>TOUGHS IN THE PARTY READY TO TAKE HIS PLACE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
