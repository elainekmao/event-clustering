(U) SUMMARY:  The U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) </p><p>funded Strategically Managing AIDS Responses Together </p><p>(SMARTWork) project officially commenced on January 23.  The </p><p>Charge and senior GVN officials spoke at the launch.  The </p><p>SMARTWork project focuses on the prevention of HIV/AIDS in </p><p>the workplace by working with the government, labor unions, </p><p>and employers to formulate effective workplace policies and </p><p>programs.  It is clear to the international community here </p><p>that over the last few years HIV/AIDS has become a </p><p>development issue.  Given its positive response to this </p><p>program, Vietnam finally appears ready to face and address </p><p>this reality.  Of the six USDOL projects falling under the </p><p>2000 MOU on labor cooperation, this program was the last one </p><p>approved by the GVN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Continuing implementation of the 2000 U.S.-Vietnam </p><p>Memorandum of Understanding on Labor and its accompanying </p><p>technical assistance programs described in reftel, the U.S. </p><p>Department of Labor (USDOL) funded Strategically Managing </p><p>AIDS Responses Together (SMARTWork) was officially launched </p><p>on January 23.  This 4-year, $600,000 program is being </p><p>executed by the Academy for Educational Development in </p><p>collaboration with Vietnam\'s Ministry of Labor, Invalids and </p><p>Social Affairs (MOLISA), the Vietnam General Confederation </p><p>of Labor (VGCL) the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry </p><p>(VCCI), and the Ministry of Health (MOH).  These bodies will </p><p>cooperate to carry out research, provide technical </p><p>assistance, develop communication materials and strategies, </p><p>and conduct national and provincial workshops for the </p><p>benefit of workers, managers and their families.  The </p><p>program calls on them to work together in the development of </p><p>workplace and national-level policies and in the provision </p><p>of support for workers and their families infected and </p><p>affected by HIV/AIDS. </p><p>3.  (U) At the official launch, speakers from the Embassy </p><p>and every agency present emphasized the importance of this </p><p>project.  Universally, they recognized Vietnam\'s growing </p><p>HIV/AIDS problem and appreciated the unique opportunity </p><p>provided by this program.  As the first attempt to address </p><p>the epidemic by bringing together the government, unions, </p><p>and employers, it will reach a larger audience and encompass </p><p>more viewpoints.  Charge Porter emphasized the need to </p><p>address HIV/AIDS in order to ensure that the considerable </p><p>progress made on poverty reduction and economic growth in </p><p>Vietnam is not reversed. </p><p>4.  (SBU) COMMENT: Although the program was originally </p><p>designed to work with twenty enterprises, it will probably </p><p>work with many more because of strong demand from the firms </p><p>themselves.  If the GVN was previously unsure of the need or </p><p>utility for such a project, clearly the demand exists as </p><p>Vietnam attempts to cope with its growing HIV/AIDS epidemic. </p><p>Over the last few years, the international community has </p><p>sought to address HIV/AIDS as a development issue, but the </p><p>GVN had resisted.  Given the GVN\'s positive response to this </p><p>program, Vietnam appears ready to finally face and address </p><p>this reality. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
