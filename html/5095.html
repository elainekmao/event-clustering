(REFS B-G NODIS SPARROW </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: (U) AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY:  This message summarizes </p><p>the current state of planning in Kuwait for humanitarian </p><p>aspects of Iraq contingency.  Most of this information has </p><p>been reported previously in greater detail.  Coordination is </p><p>ongoing among the Embassy, US military, GOK, Kuwait Red </p><p>Crescent (KRCS),  ICRC, and UNHCR.  The GOK is adamant that </p><p>no Iraqi Displaced Civilians (DCs) will be allowed to cross </p><p>the border, but it intends to provide and facilitate </p><p>assistance inside Iraq.  The GOK is keen to participate in </p><p>the Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC); it is exploring </p><p>alternatives after its initial offer to have KRCS host and </p><p>direct the HOC ran afoul of the Red Cross/Red Crescent </p><p>movement\'s principle of neutrality.  Elements of a large DART </p><p>team will begin arriving in Kuwait around January 15.   END </p><p>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The Embassy and the Civil Affairs branch (C-9) of </p><p>Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) have </p><p>participated in extensive coordination meetings with the GOK, </p><p>generally chaired by MFA with the participation of Ministry </p><p>of Defense and Ministry of Interior as well as KRCS.  The USG </p><p>inter-agency Humanitarian Planning Team (HPT) visited here in </p><p>December.  Elements of a large DART team will begin arriving </p><p>in Kuwait around January 15; their focus will be more on </p><p>reconstruction than immediate humanitarian assistance. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The GOK is adamantly opposed to allowing Iraqi DCs to </p><p>enter Kuwait, but it is willing to provide assistance to them </p><p>on the Iraqi side of the border, and to facilitate efforts of </p><p>IOs and NGOs to provide similar assistance.  It does not want </p><p>to play any role in providing security for DCs, for fear that </p><p>emotions between Kuwaitis and Iraqis still run high and could </p><p>lead to violent incidents.  (NOTE:  The constitution </p><p>prohibits Kuwaiti military forces from crossing the border, </p><p>and it would be a violation of the Demilitarized Zone for </p><p>Kuwaiti military to approach within 5 kms. of the Iraqi </p><p>border.  UNIKOM, the UN mission that monitors the DMZ, would </p><p>probably not be there to record any such violation, however, </p><p>as its plan calls for it to withdraw completely in the event </p><p>of conflict.  END NOTE.)  The GOK considers it politically </p><p>acceptable for KRCS personnel to cross the border (either </p><p>under ICRC auspices or in their own right) without exposing </p><p>Kuwait to charges of occupying Iraqi territory, because such </p><p>movement would be under cover of "friendly forces." </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The GOK is keen to participate actively in the </p><p>Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) which CFLCC intends to </p><p>establish in Kuwait.  The GOK initially offered to have KRCS </p><p>host and direct the HOC, but deferred to ICRC protests that </p><p>this would violate the principle of neutrality on which the </p><p>Red Cross/Red Crescent movement depends in order to be able </p><p>to operate on both sides during a conflict.  At this writing, </p><p>the GOK is exploring alternatives by which it can play an </p><p>active role in the HOC. </p><p> </p><p>5. ICRC is within "a few days" of having the logistical </p><p>capacity and materiel sufficient to provide aid to up to </p><p>27,000 DCs in an initial phase (out of a total of 100,000 </p><p>throughout Iraq), but it does not yet have the additional </p><p>personnel who would be needed.  ICRC says two major </p><p>logistical centers are being built up in Iran, whose Red </p><p>Crescent Society has "impressive capabilities." </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) UNHCR has made it clear that it is willing to assist </p><p>any DCs stranded near the border and unable to cross it (i.e. </p><p>not yet technically refugees, and therefore technically not </p><p>under UNHCR\'s mandate).  The regional director in Riyadh is </p><p>handling Iraq contingency planning.  The small office in </p><p>Kuwait is being reinforced with an Emergency Coordinator </p><p>(already here) and additional staff.  Logistics bases are in </p><p>Aqaba, Jordan and Iskenderun, Turkey. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) IOM and Mercy Corps are visiting Kuwait now, and IOM </p><p>has already announced its intention to open an office here. </p><p>We anticipate that other IOs and NGOs may decide to use </p><p>Kuwait as a base of operations for Iraq, once the HOC is </p><p>established. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT:  The state of coordination regarding </p><p>humanitarian contingency planning is quite advanced compared </p><p>to the run-up to Desert Storm.  The Embassy will continue to </p><p>press to maintain and accelerate this coordination in the </p><p>weeks ahead. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
