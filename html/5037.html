<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 000086 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/03/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, EU, IT, TX, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: OSCE: GOI ON IMPROVING U.S./EU COORDINATION; </p><p>TURKMENISTAN "MOSCOW MECHANISM" </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) STATE 02778 B) OSCE CIO WORK PLAN </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON: 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C) SUMMARY AND REQUEST FOR GUIDANCE.  DURING A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00086  100733Z </p><p>DISCUSSION ON TURKMENISTAN "MOSCOW MECHANISM" (SEE PARA 5), </p><p>MFA OSCE OFFICE DIRECTOR FABIO CRISTIANI STRESSED THE </p><p>IMPORTANCE OF U.S./EU COORDINATION ON OSCE ISSUES, AND </p><p>OFFERED TO TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO HELP FIND "COMMON GROUND" </p><p>BETWEEN THE U.S. AND EU ON REF B CIO WORK PLAN AND ANY OTHER </p><p>ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE IN THE COMING YEAR. POST REQUESTS </p><p>DEPARTMENT\'S PRELIMINARY VIEWS ON REF B DOCUMENT TO SHARE </p><p>WITH CRISTIANI.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  CRISTIANI SAID THAT OVERALL, THE GOI WAS PLEASED </p><p>WITH THE RESULTS OF THE DECEMBER OPORTO MINISTERIAL, DESPITE </p><p>DOWN-TO-THE-WIRE NEGOTIATIONS ON SOME OF THE STATEMENTS. </p><p>CRISTIANI WAS CONCERNED, HOWEVER, THAT THE EU WAS NOT </p><p>INVOLVED IN FINAL NEGOTIATIONS ON SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT </p><p>ISSUES, ESPECIALLY ON RUSSIA\'S ISTANBUL COMMITMENTS ON </p><p>GEORGIA AND MOLDOVA.  THE EU WAS LITERALLY "BEHIND CLOSED </p><p>DOORS" WHEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA WERE NEGOTIATING THE FINAL </p><p>DRAFTS.  CRISTIANI PLACED THE BLAME FOR THIS SITUATION </p><p>SQUARELY IN THE EU\'S COURT.  THE EU HAD NOT AGREED ON STRONG </p><p>INITIAL OR FALLBACK POSITIONS.  EU CAPITALS HAD BEEN </p><p>"PASSIVE" ON THESE ISSUES, HE LAMENTED, AND THE U.S. AND </p><p>RUSSIA WERE THEREFORE CORRECT IN MARGINALIZING THE EU WHEN IT </p><p>CAME TO CRUNCH TIME ON FINAL LANGUAGE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  ITALY WILL BE EU COUNCIL PRESIDENT DURING THE NEXT </p><p>OSCE MINISTERIAL, AND CRISTIANI HAS TAKEN IT UPON HIMSELF TO </p><p>MAKE SURE THAT THIS SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS DOES NOT REPEAT </p><p>ITSELF.  TO THAT END, HE SAID, THE EU SHOULD COORDINATE OFTEN </p><p>AND EARLY WITH THE U.S. ON KEY ISSUES WITHIN THE OSCE.  AS A </p><p>START, CRISTIANI ASKED FOR THE USG\'S PRELIMINARY VIEWS ON THE </p><p>TIMING AND SUBSTANCE OF THE 2003 WORK SCHEDULE PROPOSED BY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00086  100733Z </p><p>THE NETHERLANDS CHAIRMAN-IN-OFFICE, DISTRIBUTED TO OSCE </p><p>PARTICIPATING STATES ON JANUARY 6.  THE EARLIER WE KNOW EACH </p><p>OTHER POINTS OF CONVERGENCE AND DIVERGENCE, HE SAID, THE </p><p>EASIER IT WILL BE TO REACH COMMON POSITIONS.  CRISTIANI WILL </p><p>TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO HELP FIND "COMMON GROUND" BETWEEN THE </p><p>U.S. AND EU ON THIS DOCUMENT AND ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT MAY </p><p>ARISE IN THE COMING YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: ONE OF THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE RECENT </p><p>IN-HOUSE REVIEW OF U.S./EU RELATIONS WAS THAT WE NEED TO </p><p>COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY IN EU CAPITALS ON ISSUES IMPORTANT TO </p><p>THE USG -- BEFORE DEBATE BEGINS IN BRUSSELS.  CRISTIANI IS </p><p>OFFERING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO JUST THAT.  AS A FORMER </p><p>MINISTER AT ITALY\'S MISSION TO THE OSCE, AND CURRENT POINT </p><p>PERSON FOR OSCE-EU RELATIONS DURING THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY, </p><p>WE COULD NOT HAVE A BETTER ALLY IN OUR EFFORTS TO CRAFT </p><p>COMMON U.S.-EU POSITIONS ON OSCE ISSUES.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>TURKMENISTAN </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) POLOFF DREW ON POINTS REF A TO EMPHASIZE USG CONCERNS </p><p>REGARDING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TURKMENISTAN, AND TO REQUEST </p><p>GOI SUPPORT FOR INVOKING THE OSCE\'S "MOSCOW MECHANISM" TO </p><p>DEPLOY A FACT FINDING MISSION OF EXPERTS.  CRISTIANI SAID </p><p>THAT THE GOI SHARED OUR CONCERNS, AND AGREED THAT A DEMARCHE </p><p>TO THE GOT URGING COOPERATION WITH THE OSCE, AND A PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENT ALONG THE SAME LINES, WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MOVE </p><p>THE THUS-FAR INTRANSIGENT REGIME IN ASHKABAT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00086  100733Z </p><p>6.  (C)  CRISTIANI FELT THAT DELIVERING THE DEMARCHE AND </p><p>RELEASING THE STATEMENT THROUGH THE EU, SPECIFICALLY THE EU </p><p>TROIKA, WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A SERIES OF BILATERAL </p><p>APPROACHES AND INDIVIDUAL RELEASES.  THE EU WAS ENERGIZED ON </p><p>THE MATTER, HE CONTINUED, AND THE GOI WOULD MAKE SURE IT WAS </p><p>RAISED DURING THE LUNCH FOR EU OSCE PARTICIPATING STATES ON </p><p>JANUARY 9 IN VIENNA, AND AT THE EU POLITICAL-SECURITY AND </p><p>COREPER MEETINGS JANUARY 14 AND 15 IN BRUSSELS.  CRISTIANI </p><p>WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE GREEK PRESIDENCY WOULD AGREE TO A </p><p>STRONG TROIKA STATEMENT, WHICH WOULD BE APPROVED BY OTHER EU </p><p>MEMBER STATES.  HE SAID THE STATEMENT WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT </p><p>GOT REACTION TO THE JANUARY 3 LETTER SIGNED BY THE GERMAN, </p><p>U.S., FRENCH, UK, AND ROMANIAN AMBASSADORS TO TURKMENISTAN </p><p>URGING GOT COOPERATION. </p><p>SKODON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00086 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
