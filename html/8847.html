<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001139 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS, PRM/RMACKLER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, BT, NP, Bhutanese Refugees </p><p>SUBJECT: BHUTANESE REFUGEES STAGE PEACEFUL PROTESTS IN </p><p>KHUNDANABARI CAMP </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 977 </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  ON JUNE 18, THE NEPAL-BHUTAN JOINT </p><p>VERIFICATION TEAM ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF THE </p><p>KHUNDANABARI CAMP VERIFICATION.  THE RESULTS WERE </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH INFORMATION POST RECEIVED AFTER THE </p><p>FOURTEENTH JOINT MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE MEETING ON MAY 22 </p><p>(REFTEL).  HOWEVER, INCONSISTENCIES ABOUND IN THE </p><p>CLASSIFICATION OF FAMILIES.  CAMP RESIDENTS STAGED </p><p>PEACEFUL PROTESTS ON JUNE 19 AND HELD TALKS WITH GON CAMP </p><p>ADMINISTRATORS.  NON-VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS ARE EXPECTED </p><p>TO CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) ON JUNE 18, THE NEPAL-BHUTAN JOINT VERIFICATION </p><p>TEAM ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF THE KHUNDANABARI CAMP </p><p>VERIFICATION PROCESS.  UNHCR OFFICERS PRESENT AT THE CAMPS </p><p>REPORTED THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE DELIVERED </p><p>"PROFESSIONALLY AND ORDERLY" AT THE SECTORAL LEVEL </p><p>(ROUGHLY 2000 RESIDENTS PER SECTOR) WITH ONLY HEADS-OF- </p><p>HOUSEHOLD PRESENT.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAME LATE IN THE DAY </p><p>AFTER RESIDENTS HAD WAITED FOR HOURS IN THE HEAT.  UNHCR </p><p>DESCRIBED THE RESIDENTS\' REACTIONS AS "VERY CALM, TOO </p><p>CALM; PERHAPS THEY WERE IN A STATE OF SHOCK." </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) A WORLD FOOD PROGRAM OFFICER ALSO REPORTED THAT </p><p>RESIDENTS APPEARED CONFUSED ABOUT THE APPEAL PROCESS. </p><p>GUIDELINES AND APPEAL FORMS WERE DISTRIBUTED WITH THE JUNE </p><p>18 ANNOUNCEMENT.  THE GUIDELINES REQUIRE RESIDENTS TO SHOW </p><p>EVIDENCE OF A PROCEDURAL ERROR REGARDING THEIR </p><p>CLASSIFICATION OR NEW DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF THEIR </p><p>STATUS.  HOWEVER, UNHCR REPRESENTATIVES ARE NOT OPTIMISTIC </p><p>THAT ANY CAMP RESIDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO REVERSE THE </p><p>RULING; ALL RESIDENTS HAVE ALREADY PRESENTED ALL THEIR </p><p>DOCUMENTATION AND PROOF OF BHUTANESE CITIZENSHIP, UNHCR </p><p>REPORTED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) CLASSIFICATION OF KHUNDANABARI CAMP RESIDENTS INTO </p><p>THE FOUR CATEGORIES WAS AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-- CATEGORY I (BHUTANESE WHO WERE FORCED TO DEPART) 2.4 </p><p>PERCENT OR 293 PEOPLE OF 74 FAMILIES; </p><p> </p><p>-- CATEGORY II (BHUTANESE WHO LEFT VOLUNTARILY) 70.55 </p><p>PERCENT OR 8,595 PEOPLE OF 2,182 FAMILIES; </p><p> </p><p>-- CATEGORY III (NON-BHUTANESE) 24.2 PERCENT OR 2,948 </p><p>PEOPLE OF 817 FAMILIES; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- CATEGORY IV (CRIMINALS) 2.85 PERCENT OR 347 PEOPLE OF </p><p>85 FAMILIES. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) UNHCR IS CONCERNED THAT SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>INCONSISTENCIES EXIST IN THE CLASSIFICATION THAT WILL LEAD </p><p>TO THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES.  IN SOME CASES, FATHERS </p><p>WERE CATEGORIZED AS NON-BHUTANESE (CAT III), BUT THEIR </p><p>SONS WERE CATEGORIZED AS EITHER CRIMINALS (CAT IV) OR </p><p>BHUTANESE WHO DEPARTED VOLUNTARILY (CAT II).  UNHCR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT ENTIRE FAMILIES, </p><p>INCLUDING CHILDREN, HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS CRIMINALS </p><p>(CAT IV) EVEN THOUGH THE CHILDREN MAY HAVE NEVER SET FOOT </p><p>IN BHUTAN. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) ON JUNE 19, KHUNDANABARI CAMP RESIDENTS STAGED </p><p>PROTEST DEMONSTRATIONS AND HELD TALKS WITH CAMP </p><p>SECRETARIES.  (CAMP SECRETARIES FALL UNDER THE AUTHORITY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>OF THE GOVERNMENT OF NEPAL\'S HOME MINISTRY.)  CAMP </p><p>CHILDREN REFUSED TO ATTEND SCHOOL ON JUNE 19, BUT ALL </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS REMAINED NON-VIOLENT.  UNHCR PREDICTS THAT </p><p>THE PROTESTS WILL CONTINUE FOR 4-5 DAYS AT LEAST, BUT THAT </p><p>THEY WILL REMAIN PEACEFUL.  THE PROTESTORS\' GOAL APPEARED </p><p>TO BE TO ATTRACT INTERNATIONAL AND MEDIA ATTENTION TO </p><p>THEIR PLIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) ALSO ON JUNE 19, GUIDELINES FOR REPATRIATION WERE </p><p>READ ALOUD TO CATEGORY I AND II RESIDENTS.  UNHCR OFFICERS </p><p>REPORTED THAT THE GUIDELINES DID NOT PRESENT ANY NEW RULES </p><p>REGARDING CATEGORY II RESIDENTS\' REAPPLICATION FOR </p><p>BHUTANESE CITIZENSHIP.  THOSE RESIDENTS WHO IMMIGRATED </p><p>WITH PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO </p><p>REAPPLY FOR CITIZENSHIP AFTER A SUCCESSFUL 2-YEAR </p><p>PROBATION PERIOD AS LONG AS THE APPLICANT IS NOT </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>CATEGORY II RESIDENTS WHO IMMIGRATED WITHOUT PRIOR </p><p>APPROVAL OF THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR </p><p>CITIZENSHIP.  THE GUIDELINES REPORTEDLY SPECIFY THAT </p><p>APPLICANTS MUST BE PRESENT IN BHUTAN AT THE TIME OF </p><p>APPLICATION AND THAT IDENTIFICATION CARDS WILL BE ISSUED </p><p>FOR THE PROBATION PERIOD.  THE GUIDELINES ALSO REPORTEDLY </p><p>ASSURED RESIDENTS THAT ALL RETURNEES WOULD BE GUARANTEED </p><p>GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) COMMENT.  THE FATE OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>BHUTANESE REFUGEES REMAINS DOUBTFUL.  ALTHOUGH RESIDENTS </p><p>NOW HAVE 15 DAYS TO APPEAL, IT IS UNLIKELY ANY WILL </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY REVERSE THE VERIFICATION TEAM\'S RULING. </p><p>MOREOVER, THE GUIDELINES FOR REPATRIATION CONTINUE TO BE </p><p>VAGUELY WORDED, LEAVING MAJOR UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING HOW </p><p>MANY CATEGORY II RESIDENTS WILL RECEIVE BHUTANESE </p><p>CITIZENSHIP AFTER THE TWO-YEAR PROBATION PERIOD.  MANY </p><p>QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED REGARDING WHERE THE </p><p>REPATRIATED REFUGEES WILL LIVE AND HOW THEY WILL EARN A </p><p>LIVING.  THE POTENTIAL FOR A HUGE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN </p><p>BHUTAN REMAINS STRONG.  POST AGAIN URGES THE DEPARTMENT TO </p><p>APPROACH BHUTAN\'S DONOR GOVERNMENTS ABOUT PRESSURING THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF BHUTAN, PRIOR TO THE 15TH JOINT MINISTERIAL </p><p>ON AUGUST 11, TO ALLOW FOR INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>THE REPATRIATION PROCESS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
