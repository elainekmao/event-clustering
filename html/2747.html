(U) EMBASSY ROME CONCLUDES THAT IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE </p><p>TO DELIVER REF A DEMARCHE TO ITALY.  THE GOI IS ALREADY </p><p>MAKING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL, MILITARY, AND TROOP </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO OEF, THE STABILIZATION OF THE BALKANS, ISAF, </p><p>THE RECONSTRUCTION OF AFGHANISTAN, AND THE PROTECTION OF THE </p><p>FORMER KING OF AFGHANISTAN, IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTIONS TO </p><p>OTHER MULTILATERAL AND PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>--- </p><p>OEF </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ITALY HAS COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT ASSETS FOR OPERATION </p><p>ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF), INCLUDING: ITALY\'S ONE AIRCRAFT </p><p>CARRIER "GARIBALDI", EIGHT HARRIER JETS AND SIX TORNADO </p><p>RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT.  THE ITALIAN MILITARY HAS DEPLOYED </p><p>ONE OF THE FOUR LARGEST FORCES IN THE COALITION SUPPORTING </p><p>OEF, INCLUDING OVER 2,500 MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND IS ONE OF </p><p>THE FEW COALITION ALLIES TO MOVE ITS ASSETS TO THE THEATER </p><p>UNASSISTED.

THESE ACTIONS WERE TAKEN </p><p>WITHOUT PROMPTING BY US OFFICIALS AND WERE CLEARLY THE RESULT </p><p>OF DIRECTION FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE GOI.  THE GOI HAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01826  01 OF 02  151228Z </p><p>MADE ITS MILITARY FACILITIES READILY AVAILABLE FOR OEF </p><p>DEPLOYMENTS TO THE THEATER, A CONTRIBUTION THE US HAS MADE </p><p>CONSIDERABLE USE OF GIVEN ITALY\'S STRATEGIC LOCATION.

THE GOI RECENTLY AGREED TO </p><p>EXTEND ITS COMMITMENT TO ISAF WHEN ISAF\'S ORIGINAL MANDATE </p><p>WAS EXTENDED DESPITE ITALY\'S EXTENSIVE TROOP COMMITMENTS </p><p>ELSEWHERE.  ISAF HAS ESTABLISHED TWO QUICK-REACTION UNITS OF </p><p>PLATOON SIZE.  ONE OF THESE UNITS WILL BE MADE UP ENTIRELY OF </p><p>ITALIAN CARABINIERI.  THESE UNITS WILL BE DEDICATED TO </p><p>ASSISTING THE FORMER KING OF AFGHANISTAN IN THE EVENT OF </p><p>TROUBLE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION OF AFGHANISTAN </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.

ITALY HAS ALSO COMMITTED SOME 35 MILLION </p><p>EUROS (ABOUT 31 MILLION DOLLARS) TO BILATERAL ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01826  01 OF 02  151228Z </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  SOME OF THE BILATERAL EFFORTS ITALY EXPECTS TO </p><p>UNDERTAKE IN AFGHANISTAN INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF AFGHAN MINISTRIES, COOPERATION IN POLICE </p><p>TRAINING, AND SUPPORT FOR AFGHAN PARTICIPATION IN THE 2008 </p><p>OLYMPIC GAMES (REF C).  WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE SERIOUS </p><p>EARTHQUAKE THAT STRUCK THE PROVINCE OF BAGHLAN ON MARCH 25, </p><p>THE GOI SENT MEDICINE AND EMERGENCY GOODS AND ALLOCATED 2 </p><p>MILLION EUROS (ABOUT 1.8 MILLION DOLLARS) TO THE PRIMARY </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING IN THE AREA.  THE GOI </p><p>PLANS TO ASSIST IN CULTURAL REHABILITATION AND REVITALIZATION </p><p>OF AFGHANISTAN\'S JUDICIAL PROGRAMS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>THE PROTECTION OF THE FORMER KING OF AFGHANISTAN </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ITALY HAS EXPENDED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES IN PROVIDING </p><p>PROTECTION FOR THE FORMER KING OF AFGHANISTAN DURING HIS </p><p>30-YEAR EXILE IN ROME.  MUCH OF THIS ASSISTANCE, INCLUDING </p><p>FINANCIAL AID TO MAINTAIN AN OFFICE FOR THE "ROME GROUP" OF </p><p>AFGHAN MODERATE EXILES LEADING UP TO THE BONN NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>LAST DECEMBER, WAS PROVIDED AT THE BEHEST OF OR IN </p><p>COORDINATION WITH THE USG. </p><p> </p><p>6.

THE GOI ALSO AGREED TO </p><p>PROVIDE PROTECTION DIRECTLY TO THE KING UNTIL SUCH TIME AS </p><p>THE AFGHAN PROTECTIVE DETAIL WAS FULLY TRAINED AND CAPABLE OF </p><p>PROVIDING THE PROTECTION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01826  02 OF 02  151229Z </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>BALKANS </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) ITALY IS THE SECOND LARGEST TROOP CONTRIBUTOR IN THE </p><p>BALKANS, WITH ABOUT 7,500 SERVING IN BOSNIA (SFOR) AND KOSOVO </p><p>(KFOR), AND ANOTHER 1,200 AS PART OF COMZWEST IN ALBANIA (REF </p><p>D).  ITALIAN CARABINIERI CONSTITUTE MORE THAN HALF OF THE </p><p>MULTINATIONAL SPECIALIZED UNITS (MSUS) NEEDED FOR </p><p>LAW-ENFORCEMENT TASKS IN BOSNIA.  THE GOI IS ONE OF THE </p><p>LEADING BILATERAL PROVIDERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AID TO ALBANIA </p><p>WHERE THE DROP IN CLANDESTINE IMMIGRATION IS LARGELY DUE TO </p><p>ITALIAN POLICE ASSISTANCE (REF E). </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) ITALY COMMANDS COMZWEST, ONE OF FIVE SECTORS IN KOSOVO </p><p>CONTROLLED BY KFOR.  AN ITALIAN GENERAL (GENERAL CABIGIOSU) </p><p>ABLY COMMANDED KFOR FROM OCTOBER 2000-APRIL 2001, AND ANOTHER </p><p>ITALIAN IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE COMMAND OF KFOR IN OCTOBER 2002. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) THE GOI WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO OFFER TROOPS (750) FOR </p><p>TASK FORCE ESSENTIAL HARVEST TO RECOVER WEAPONS FROM ARMED </p><p>GROUPS IN MACEDONIA IN 2001.  ITALIAN SOLDIERS ARE CURRENTLY </p><p>ENGAGED IN TASK FORCE FOX (TFF), WHOSE MISSION IS TO PROVIDE </p><p>SECURITY FOR OSCE OBSERVERS IN MACEDONIA.  ITALY HAD OFFERED </p><p>TO TAKE COMMAND OF TFF THIS SPRING, HOWEVER GERMANY AGREED TO </p><p>RETAIN COMMAND UNTIL JUNE. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>ITALY IS DOING ITS BEST </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01826  02 OF 02  151229Z </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) ITALY CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE ITS FIRM COMMITMENT TO </p><p>THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM, TO THE NATO ALLIANCE AND TO </p><p>OTHER AVENUES FOR FOSTERING SECURITY IN EUROPE AND BEYOND, </p><p>INCLUDING PARTICIPATION IN BOTH UN AND NON-UN PEACEKEEPING </p><p>FORCES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  SINCE THE SEPTEMBER 11 </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS, THE GOI HAS BEEN A FULL PARTNER WITH THE </p><p>US IN ANTI-TERRORISM MEASURES IN THE DIPLOMATIC, </p><p>INTELLIGENCE, LAW ENFORCEMENT, FINANCIAL CONTROL AND OTHER </p><p>AREAS.  THE MOST VISIBLE DISPLAY OF THIS COMMITMENT WAS THE </p><p>DISPATCH OF TROOPS IN SUPPORT OF OEF, A DEPLOYMENT ENDORSED </p><p>BY NEARLY 90% OF THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT DESPITE THE </p><p>CONSIDERABLE STRAIN THAT ITALY\'S ACTIVE MILITARY ROLE PLACES </p><p>ON THE ITALIAN BUDGET (REF B). </p><p> </p><p>11.
