<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 003178 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR NEA, NEA/ARP, NEA/IPA, AND IO/UNP </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/08 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KPAL, KWBG, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: UAEG LARGEST AID DONOR TO THE PALESTINIANS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABU DHABI 3117 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary and comment: Despite ongoing humanitarian </p><p>assistance activities in Afghanistan and now Iraq, the UAEG </p><p>is continuing its robust aid programs to the Palestinians. </p><p>The UAEG already has channeled nearly USD 78 million in </p><p>project assistance to Palestinians in the West Bank and </p><p>Gaza Strip since September 2000, and pledged an additional </p><p>USD 42 million at the 2003 Sharm Al-Sheikh (USD 21 million) </p><p>and 2002 Beirut (USD 21 million) Summits -- making the UAE </p><p>the largest Arab aid donor to the Palestinians since the </p><p>Intifadah began more than two years ago (see reftel). </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Summary and comment continued: The majority of both </p><p>official and private contributions generally are funneled </p><p>through the government-controlled Red Crescent Authority </p><p>(RCA), which in turn provides the assistance to the </p><p>Palestinians in the form of project aid and goods -- not </p><p>cash.  The RCA created in August 2002 a separate oversight </p><p>committee consisting of RCA, UNRWA, and Palestinian </p><p>Authority representatives to track implementation of these </p><p>projects.  We are confident that oversight of RCA </p><p>operations is of a high standard.  As some measure of the </p><p>UAEG\'s desire to ensure that donations are not misdirected </p><p>or misused, Emirati officials have assured us time and </p><p>again that funds are transferred through legitimate </p><p>channels and no monies go to the families of </p><p>homicide/suicide bombers.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p>RCA Administers Official Aid </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The RCA, chaired by de facto Minister of Foreign </p><p>Affairs Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan, has provided </p><p>large amounts of humanitarian aid, such as blankets and </p><p>medicines, to the Palestinians in recent years, and </p><p>organized regional food and clothing drives across the UAE </p><p>in 2002.  The RCA also announced in August 2002 detailed </p><p>plans to rebuild 800 housing units and various </p><p>infrastructure facilities destroyed during Israeli </p><p>incursions into Jenin at a cost of USD 27 million.  As a </p><p>result of its positive efforts, the RCA is one of the few </p><p>Arab humanitarian organizations permitted by Israeli </p><p>authorities to continue working in Israeli occupied areas. </p><p> </p><p>Royal Family Contributions Are Significant... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Although we do not have official tallies, the </p><p>private donations of royal family members to the </p><p>Palestinians certainly total tens of millions of dollars. </p><p>Most recently, local press announced July 5 the generous </p><p>USD 1 million donation by Shaykha Fatima bint Mubarak Al- </p><p>Kitbi -- President Zayid\'s wife and UAE First Lady -- </p><p>toward the construction of the Shaykha Fatima </p><p>Rehabilitation Center For Disabled Children in Hebron.  The </p><p>RCA, the International Labor Organization, and the UN </p><p>Development Program are supervising the construction of the </p><p>USD 3.5 million facility, which will provide vocational </p><p>training to approximately 700,000 disabled Palestinians. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) President Zayid bin Sultan Al-Nahyan likewise </p><p>undertook in April 2002 to personally bear the cost of </p><p>repairing damage inflicted on the Church of the Nativity </p><p>and nearby Omar Mosque as a result of the three-week long </p><p>standoff between Israeli forces and Palestinians holed up </p><p>in the church compound.  Shaykh Zayid instructed the RCA to </p><p>initiate contact with mosque and church authorities in </p><p>Bethlehem and begin renovations immediately. </p><p> </p><p>...As Are Private Donations </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) There has also been an enormous outpouring of </p><p>private UAE donations to the Palestinians.  Fundraising </p><p>campaigns conducted in Abu Dhabi and Dubai raised close to </p><p>USD 100 million in 2002.  UAE embassies abroad and local </p><p>government offices have been encouraged to collectively </p><p>donate one day\'s salary to assist the Palestinian refugees </p><p>in Jenin, and students\' groups and other civic associations </p><p>have rallied to the cause.  Funds raised through such </p><p>public campaigns are funneled through the RCA in Abu Dhabi </p><p>or the Shaykh Mohammed bin Rashid Charitable Foundation in </p><p>the case of Dubai. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
