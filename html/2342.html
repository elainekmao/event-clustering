<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 003270 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR INL A/S BEERS AND AF A/S KANSTEINER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NARCOTICS CERTIFICATION DISCUSSIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU) I understand that A/S Beers chaired a December 13 </p><p>interagency meeting on the potential application of a new </p><p>narcotics certification standard for those countries on the </p><p>"majors" list, which includes Nigeria.  From what we have </p><p>heard, Nigeria was given the dubious distinction of joining </p><p>Burma, Afghanistan and Haiti as those that might meet the new </p><p>(lower) standard for decertification.  While I understand </p><p>that this was a preliminary, informal meeting, the new </p><p>standard is now law (with the December 20th passing of the </p><p>Foreign Operations Bill) and I am concerned about the </p><p>predilection of some to condemn Nigeria, even after an </p><p>unusually successful year of improvements on the law </p><p>enforcement front.  Let us not forget that a little over two </p><p>years ago we did not even have a dialogue with the NDLEA on </p><p>counter-narcotics issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) In the last 12 months, the GON has: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--increased funding for the NDLEA by 200 percent; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--introduced new money-laundering legislation and drafted </p><p>additional legislative proposals to centralize and coordinate </p><p>efforts to fight terrorism financing and financial crimes in </p><p>line with the FATF; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--increased drug seizures by almost 80 percent over 2000; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--started the investigation of a major Nigeria-based </p><p>trafficker in cooperation with DEA; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--effectively prevented drug trafficking on direct flights </p><p>from Nigeria to the U.S., which resumed in Frebuary (while we </p><p>note far greater U.S. Customs seizures of drugs from flights </p><p>originating in Ghana); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--granted NDLEA access to Nigeria\'s sea ports - a </p><p>long-standing USG demand; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--opened the NDLEA Training Academy in Jos, which will yield </p><p>a higher degree of professionalism within the Agency (the </p><p>first class of 248 cadets graduated December 20); </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--opened a high-level law enforcement dialogue with the USG, </p><p>covering the complete gambit of law enforcement issues (eight </p><p>categories); and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--engaged the Financial Action Task Force in an effort to </p><p>address the FATF\'s and USG\'s concerns on money laundering </p><p>(this includes taking the initiative of sending an Attorney </p><p>General-led delegation to Rome in early December to meet with </p><p>the FATF\'s Africa and Middle East Review Group). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU)  Underscoring the vastly improved GON performance on </p><p>drug control this year was a report I recently received form </p><p>the DEA Attache in Lagos:  on December 13 the NDLEA unit at </p><p>Murtala Mohammed International Airport made a 3.8 kilogram </p><p>seizure of cocaine hidden in the false bottom of a suitcase </p><p>belonging to a Rome-bound (via London on British Airways) </p><p>passenger.  The seizure marks the first made using one of the </p><p>INL-donated Itemisers.  Things have changed for the better. </p><p>Nigeria deserves our congratulations and certification, not </p><p>our condemnation and association with Burma and Afghanistan. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
