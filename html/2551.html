<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000572 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF, PDAS BELLAMY; ALSO FOR AF/S </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/23/03 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MORE ON TSVANGIRAI\'S ALLEGED "PLOT" TO </p><p>         "ELIMINATE" MUGABE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) HARARE 411 B) HARARE 501 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DCM REWHITEHEAD DUE TO 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  THE GOZ FIRED ANOTHER OFF-TARGET </p><p>SALVO IN ITS CONTINUING ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT MDC </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MORGAN TSVANGIRAI THROUGH </p><p>ACCUSATIONS THAT HE APPROACHED THE CANADIAN DICKENS AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00572  01 OF 02  051236Z </p><p>MADSON LOBBYING FIRM, HEADED BY ONE ARI BEN MENASHE, TO </p><p>ARRANGE THE "ASSASSINATION" OF PRESIDENT MUGABE (REFS A </p><p>AND B).  A MARCH 3 ZBC TELEVISION BROADCAST AGAIN SHOWED </p><p>FILM CLIPS OF TSVANGIRAI TALKING WITH BEN MENASHE AND </p><p>OTHER UNIDENTIFIED OBSERVERS.  A SECOND SEGMENT OF THE </p><p>ZBC PROGRAM FEATURED AIR FORCE COMMANDER PERENCE SHIRI </p><p>DESCRIBING A SECOND MEETING WITH MDC MPS JOB SIKHALA AND </p><p>TAFADZWA MUSEKIWA, WHOM SHIRI CLAIMED HAD OFFERED HIM A </p><p>HEFTY FEE TO ASSIST THE MDC WITH A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO </p><p>POWER AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  THE ENTIRE ZBC </p><p>PROGRAM WAS AMATEURISH TO THE EXTREME AND OFFERED LITTLE </p><p>CONVINCING EVIDENCE TO BUTTRESS THE GOZ\'S CASE (OR </p><p>ELECTORAL STRENGTH).  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION GLEANED </p><p>FROM CANADIAN DIPLOMATS SHEDS LIGHT ON TSVANGIRAI\'S </p><p>MOTIVE FOR MEETING BEN MENASHE AND COMPANY, BUT BRINGS </p><p>INTO QUESTION HIS JUDGMENT IN THIS AFFAIR.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>FIRING A DUD </p><p>------------ </p><p>2.  (U) THE MUCH ANTICIPATED TELEVISION EXPOSE ON MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S ALLEGED PLOT TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MUGABE TURNED OUT TO BE MUCH ADO ABOUT LITTLE.  THE </p><p>PROGRAM OPENED WITH A REBROADCAST OF THE GRAINY AND </p><p>OFTEN INAUDIBLE FILM CLIPS OF TSVANGIRAI, ARI BEN </p><p>MENASHE, BEN MENASHE\'S CONSULTING COHORT, AND TWO OTHER </p><p>INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD NOT BE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED IN THE </p><p>TAPE.  AN UNCONVINCING SPLICE JOB DID LITTLE TO ENHANCE </p><p>THE CREDIBILITY OF THE TAPE, IN WHICH TSVANGIRAI -- </p><p>FOLLOWING CONSIDERABLE PROMPTING AND POSSIBLY SPLICED </p><p>OUT OF CONTEXT -- REFERS TO THE "ELIMINATION" OF MUGABE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00572  01 OF 02  051236Z </p><p>AND A THREE-PHASE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD THAT INCLUDES </p><p>DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE EXPOSE NEXT FEATURED CLIPS OF TSVANGIRAI DENYING </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN ANY PLOT, THEN BEN MENASHE (AN OLD MUGABE </p><p>ACQUAINTANCE WHO FORMERLY HAD A BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT </p><p>WITH SHIRI) CALLING TSVANGIRAI A LIAR AND PIOUSLY </p><p>INTONING THAT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO DO THE RIGHT THING </p><p>AND EXPOSE THE PLOT.  AN AUSTRALIAN INVESTIGATIVE </p><p>FILMMAKER WHO HAD PRODUCED AN HOUR-LONG TELEVISION </p><p>SEGMENT OUT OF THE TAPE, LARGELY DEPENDING ON VOICE OVER </p><p>TECHNIQUES, DEFENDED HIS ROLE.  THE ZBC BROADCAST THEN </p><p>RETURNED TO THE NEWS ANNOUNCER, WHO OPENLY GLOATED OVER </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S PLIGHT.  AIR FORCE COMMANDER SHIRI WAS NEXT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>IN LINE.  FOLLOWING A TELEVISED PAN OF HIS FLEET OF </p><p>PLASTIC MODEL AIRPLANES, A CAMERA SHY SHIRI DESCRIBED </p><p>HOW MDC MPS SIKHALA AND MUSEKIWA HAD OFFERED HIM A 10 </p><p>MILLION ZIMBABWEAN DOLLAR FEE TO HELP THE MDC ENGINEER A </p><p>SMOOTH TRANSFER OF POWER FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS.  AS PROOF, SHIRI PLAYED A TAPE HE HAD MADE OF </p><p>THE MEETING.  THE RECORDING WAS SO INAUDIBLE THAT AT </p><p>MOST TIMES IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN WHAT LANGUAGE </p><p>THEY PARTICIPANTS WERE SPEAKING, LET ALONE WHAT THEY </p><p>WERE SAYING. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>A COMIC FARCE </p><p>------------- </p><p>4.  (C) THE ENTIRE BROADCAST CAME ACROSS AS FARCICAL. </p><p>IT BEGAN TWENTY MINUTES LATE AND WAS INTERRUPTED BY A </p><p>LONG PERIOD OF VIDEO MUSIC CLIPS BEFORE THE SHIRI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00572  01 OF 02  051236Z </p><p>SEGMENT BEGAN, PROMPTING ONE TO SPECULATE THAT SOMEONE </p><p>IN ZBC HAD SECOND THOUGHTS ON THE WISDOM OF EVEN AIRING </p><p>THE PROGRAM.  THE TSVANGIRAI/BEN MENASHE SEGMENT </p><p>INDICATED THAT TSVANGIRAI DID IN SOME CONTEXT USE THE </p><p>WORDS "ELIMINATE" AND "MUGABE" IN PROXIMITY, BUT WITH NO </p><p>CLEAR REFERENCE TO WHETHER THIS WAS POLITICAL IN NATURE, </p><p>OR OTHERWISE.  UNLIKE MANY OF HIS GOZ COLLEAGUES, SHIRI </p><p>IS NOT PARTICULARLY ADEPT AT PUBLICLY TWISTING THE TRUTH </p><p>AND CAME ACROSS AS MENDACIOUS AND ILL AT EASE.  WERE THE </p><p>SUBJECT MATTER AND THE STAKES NOT SO SERIOUS, THE ENTIRE </p><p>AMATEURISH PRODUCTION WOULD HAVE BEEN GENUINELY COMICAL </p><p>FARE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>5.  (C) CANADIAN DCM RONALD WILLSON PROVIDED THE DCM </p><p>WITH BACKGROUND ON THE BEN MENASHE MEETING THAT SHEDS </p><p>LIGHT ON HOW TSVANGIRAI HAD BEEN DUPED INTO THE </p><p>UNFORTUNATE ENCOUNTER IN THE FIRST PLACE.  WILSON SAID </p><p>THAT MDC SECRETARY GENERAL WELSHMAN NCUBE HAD CONFIDED </p><p>TO HIM THAT THE TWO UNIDENTIFIED MEN IN THE TAPE HAD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4659 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00572  02 OF 02  051236Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   VCE-00   NSAE-00  SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /002W </p><p>                  ------------------6FA3FB  051236Z /38 </p><p>O 051230Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1097 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY CANBERRA PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000572 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF, PDAS BELLAMY; ALSO FOR AF/S </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/23/03 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MORE ON TSVANGIRAI\'S ALLEGED "PLOT" TO </p><p>         "ELIMINATE" MUGABE </p><p> </p><p>BEEN INTRODUCED TO TSVANGIRAI PRIOR TO THE MEETING AS, </p><p>RESPECTIVELY, THE DEPUTY DIRECTORS OF THE CIA AND NSA. </p><p>ACCORDING TO NCUBE, TSVANGIRAI HAD TAKEN THE CLAIMS OF </p><p>THE TWO IMPERSONATORS AT FACE VALUE.  THE CANADIANS ALSO </p><p>INFORMED US THAT A SENIOR CIO OFFICIAL TRAVELED TO </p><p>MONTREAL AT THE TIME OF THE MONTREAL MEETING. STATE </p><p>SECURITY MINISTER GOCHE ALSO TRAVELED TO MONTREAL IN </p><p>FEBRUARY JUST PRIOR TO THE FIRST AUSTRALIAN AIRING OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00572  02 OF 02  051236Z </p><p>THE VIDEO. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>6.  (C) UNLESS MUGABE AND HIS BACKERS HAVE MORE </p><p>COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAN THAT PRESENTED IN THE </p><p>BROADCAST, IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT TSVANGIRAI </p><p>AND HIS ASSOCIATE ARE IN MUCH DANGER OF BEING CONVICTED </p><p>IN AN IMPARTIAL COURT OF LAW.  WE OBVIOUSLY DO NOT </p><p>DISCOUNT THE ABILITY OF THE GOZ TO STRING OUT THE CASE </p><p>AND HARASS TSVANGIRAI AT THE TIME OF ITS OWN CHOOSING. </p><p>THE MONTY-PYTHONESQUE NATURE OF THE ZBC BROADCAST OFFERS </p><p>LITTLE TO CONVINCE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE </p><p>ENTIRE AFFAIR IS MORE THAN JUST ANOTHER ITEM PULLED OUT </p><p>OF THE GOZ\'S BAG OF DIRTY TRICKS.  IN TERMS OF </p><p>ELECTIONS, WE THINK THAT THE ENTIRE AFFAIR IS A NON- </p><p>EVENT.  THOSE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THE TAPE PROBABLY WILL </p><p>DO SO, AND THOSE NOT SO INCLINED WILL NOT.  WE NOTE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT IN TERMS OF GOOD JUDGMENT AND ADEQUATE </p><p>STAFF WORK, THE MONTREAL MEETING WAS NOT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S FINEST HOUR. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
