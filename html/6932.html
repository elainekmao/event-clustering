<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001876 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2013 </p><p>TAGS: CASC, AMGT, ASEC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: REPORT FROM U.S. REPORTER EXPELLED FROM </p><p>BAGHDAD MARCH 29 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Acting DCM Doug Silliman. Reason 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY - MR. NATE THAYER, A REPORTER EXPELLED FROM </p><p>IRAQ, CALLED TODAY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON SITUATION IN </p><p>BAGHDAD.  HE SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED THAT HIS COMMENTS NOT/NOT </p><p>BE PROVIDED TO PRESS OR PUBLIC.  SITUATION IN BAGHDAD IS </p><p>CHAOTIC WITH NO ONE APPEARING TO BE IN CONTROL.  MS. MARY </p><p>CAPERTON BINGHAM WAS ARRESTED AND TAKEN FROM THE ROOM SHE </p><p>SHARED WITH MR. THAYER.  AT THE SAME TIME MR. MATTHEW </p><p>MCALLESTER, MR. MOISE SAMAN (BOTH OF NEWSDAY), MR. PHILIP </p><p>LATASA (PEACE GROUP MEMBER), AND MR. JOHAN SPANNER (A DANISH </p><p>REPORTER AND CITIZEN), ALL DISAPPEARED FROM THE HOTEL. </p><p>THAYER PRESUMES THAT THEY WERE ARRESTED IN THE SAME </p><p>OPERATION. THAYER STATES THAT THE FEELING IN THE STREET IS </p><p>100 PERCENT PRO-IRAQ, ANTI-BUSH, WITH MOST OF THE CITIZENRY </p><p>IN THE STREETS BEING ARMED WITH LIGHT WEAPONS.  HE STATED </p><p>THAT HE HAD BEEN "ALL OVER" BAGHDAD IN THE PAST FEW DAYS AND </p><p>SAW NO/NO ARMORED VEHICLES.  HE REQUESTED THAT OFFICERS OF </p><p>THE DAO CONTACT HIM FOR DISCUSSIONS. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  MR. THAYER REPORTED THAT THE OFFICIALS ARRESTING MS. </p><p>BINGHAM WERE "ELITE SECURITY" TYPES AND WERE VERY </p><p>PROFESSIONAL.  THEY CAREFULLY SEPARATED BINGHAM\'S BELONGINGS </p><p>FROM HIS AND BAGGED MANY OF HER BELONGINGS FOR FURTHER </p><p>ANALYSIS.  SHE WAS THEN FORCED TO PACK UP COMPLETELY, AS </p><p>THOUGH SHE WERE TO BE EXPELLED FROM IRAQ.  WHEN THAYER TOLD </p><p>THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT TAKE HER WITHOUT HIM, HE WAS BADLY </p><p>BEATEN.  HE HAS NOT SEEN HER SINCE.  THE OTHERS MENTIONED IN </p><p>PARA 1 DISAPPEARED THE SAME NIGHT AND THEIR HOTEL ROOMS WERE </p><p>THOROUGHLY CLEANED, AS THOUGH THEY HAD NOT BEEN THERE AT ALL. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  THAYER REPORTS THAT HE IS DOUBTFUL OF THE PUBLISHED </p><p>REPORTS THAT BINGHAM, ET.AL. HAVE ENTERED SYRIA.  HIS </p><p>PERSONAL BELIEF, FOR WHICH HE ADMITS HAVING NO SOLID </p><p>EVIDENCE, IS THAT THEY WERE TAKEN TO THE SYRIAN FRONTIER AND </p><p>ARE PROBABLY BEING HELD AT THE REFUGEE CAMPS IN THE </p><p>IRAQ/SYRIA NO-MAN\'S-LAND (NOTE - DAMASCUS REPORTS THAT </p><p>ALL/ALL CAMPS ARE WITHIN SYRIA AND THAT NO ONE IS ENCAMPED ON </p><p>THE IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER.).  HE STATES THAT HE HAS HEARD, </p><p>SINCE SECRETARY RUMSFELD\'S SPEECH YESTERDAY, THAT SYRIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES ARE NOT PERMITTING US OR BRITISH CITIZENS TO </p><p>CROSS INTO SYRIA FROM IRAQ.  HE EXCEPTS THOSE THAT ARE BEING </p><p>FORMALLY EXPELLED BY IRAQI AUTHORITIES.  HE DID NOT EXPLAIN </p><p>WHY THE SYRIANS WOULD HOLD BINGHAM AND COMPANY IF THEY WERE </p><p>FORMALLY EXPELLED.  HE DOUBTS THAT SHE HAS ENTERED SYRIA </p><p>BECAUSE THE FIRST THING SHE WOULD HAVE DONE IS CALL HER </p><p>SISTER.  HE CLAIMS THAT HAS NOT YET HAPPENED.  THAYER </p><p>BELIEVES SHE MAY HAVE CONTACTED A MR. CHRISTIAN BRIGGS, OF </p><p>LONDON, BY CELL PHONE.  MR. BRIGGS HAS SOME CONNECTION TO A </p><p>HUMAN SHIELD/PEACE ACTIVIST ORGANIZATION.  THE TELEPHONE </p><p>NUMBER FOR MR. BRIGGS, PROVIDED TO MR. THAYER IS </p><p>4477-8779-4230.  HE IS UNABLE TO GET A RESPONSE AT THAT </p><p>NUMBER AND IS UNCERTAIN THAT IT IS CORRECT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  THAYER STATES THAT ONE COMPLICATING FACTOR IN </p><p>BINGHAM\'S ARREST IS HER PREVIOUS POSITION AS PHOTOGRAPHER FOR </p><p>FORMER VICE PRESIDENT GORE.  HER ADDRESS BOOK AND PERSONAL </p><p>COMPUTER CONTAINED PHOTOS, ADDRESSES, AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS </p><p>FOR WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS.  IRAQI SECURITY MAY HAVE BELIEVED </p><p>THAT SHE HAD BEEN REPORTING TO THE WHITE HOUSE DURING HER </p><p>STAY. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  THAYER REPORTS THAT AFTER MS. BINGHAM\'S ARREST, HE </p><p>WAS HARASSED BY IRAQI SECURITY FORCES AND ORDERED EXPELLED ON </p><p>SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  EXPULSIONS HE WAS LATER ABLE TO REVERSE. </p><p>YESTERDAY HE FINALLY ACCEDED AND LEFT BAGHDAD.  HE REPORTS </p><p>NO/NO IRAQI CHECKPOINTS ON THE ROAD FROM BAGDHAD TO JORDAN. </p><p>HE RAN INTO A GROUP OF AUSTRALIAN SPECIAL FORCES WHO PASSED </p><p>HIM ON TO THE BORDER.  HE REPORTS THAT HE WAS AMAZED TO SEE </p><p>LOYAL IRAQI FORCES AT THE BORDER WHO TREATED HIM QUITE </p><p>NORMALLY, EVEN TO NOTING DOWN THE SERIAL NUMBERS OF HIS </p><p>CAMERAS AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  AMMAN PA SPOKE WITH LISA BARRON OF CBS RADIO WHO </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT HER REPORT THAT MS. BINGHAM, ET. AL. HAD </p><p>CROSSED INTO SYRIA WAS PREMATURE.  NO ONE CAN CONFIRM THAT </p><p>THEY HAVE CROSSED INTO SYRIA.  SHE DESCRIBED ONE NEW REPORT </p><p>AS HAVING THEM ENROUTE TO AMMAN AND ANOTHER HAVING THEM </p><p>ALREADY IN DAMASCUS.  NOTHING CAN YET BE CONFIRMED.  WE HAVE </p><p>NO FURTHER WORD ON THE OTHER GROUP OF SIX OR SEVEN AMCITS </p><p>FROM THE CHRISTIAN PEACEMAKER TEAM THAT HAS BEEN REPORTED </p><p>UNDERWAY TO AMMAN FROM BAGHDAD. </p><p>GHNEM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
