<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L  ZAGREB 001342 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR, EUR/SCE, EUR/BI AND S/WCI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 6/12/13 </p><p>TAGS: KAWC, PREL, BH, HR, UN, UNSC, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT: CROATIA/ICTY: PIFWC ANTE GOTOVINA GOES PUBLIC </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Poloff Robert Silberstein, reasons 1.5(b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) In an undated interview published June 10, ICTY </p><p>fugitive PIFWC Ante Gotovina reportedly told Ivo Pukanic, </p><p>editor of Croatian newsmagazine "Nacional," that he </p><p>acknowledged the authority of the Hague Tribunal.  Gotovina </p><p>said that he was willing to surrender to the ICTY on the </p><p>condition that the indictment against him is suspended and he </p><p>is given the opportunity to be interviewed as a suspect by </p><p>ICTY investigators in Zagreb.  Should the OTP then decide </p><p>that an indictment is warranted, Gotovina claimed that he </p><p>would surrender quietly to The Hague. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In the interview, Gotovina criticized Croatia\'s </p><p>former HDZ government, saying that it failed to inform him of </p><p>OTP requests to interview him as a suspect in 1998.  He was </p><p>milder in his critique of the current coalition government, </p><p>but said it too let him down as it failed to communicate with </p><p>him at all after coming to power in 2000.  In what can only </p><p>be termed revisionist history, Gotovina characterized himself </p><p>as a "victim of political manipulation" from both the right </p><p>and the left.  (Note: in early 2001, Gotovina was one of 12 </p><p>retired and active-duty generals who published an open letter </p><p>harshly attacking the Racan Government for its decision to </p><p>order the arrest of Croatian Army General Mirko Norac for war </p><p>crimes committed in the town of Gospic in 1991.  Norac was </p><p>convicted in 2003.)  Gotovina extended an olive branch to </p><p>President Mesic, saying that he deplored an incident at a </p><p>military barracks in Split in May 2001 when members of the </p><p>local guards brigade openly cursed Mesic during the </p><p>President\'s visit. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Prime Minister Racan, President Mesic and Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Goran Granic (day-to-day manager of the GOC\'s </p><p>relationship with ICTY) reiterated that Gotovina had no </p><p>choice but to appear in The Hague as an indictee.  Racan </p><p>offered Gotovina the GOC\'s full support in mounting a legal </p><p>defense once the PIFWC surrendered. </p><p> </p><p>Ready to surrender? </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ICTY Zagreb ResRep Thomas Osorio told us June 11 that </p><p>he believed the Gotovina interview was authentic and very </p><p>encouraging.  He interprets the interview as a clear sign </p><p>that recent stepped-up SFOR pressure in Bosnia (tightened </p><p>border controls, sweeps of areas in which Gotovina was </p><p>suspected of taking shelter, detention of suspected </p><p>collaborators) is having the desired psychological effect on </p><p>Gotovina.  So too is pressure from the international </p><p>community; Osorio speculated that Gotovina appears to be </p><p>coming to the conclusion that even if the HDZ returns to </p><p>power he would have to remain a fugitive as any Croatian </p><p>Government would be compelled to transfer him to the ICTY. </p><p>Therefore, Gotovina may have decided to take the plunge and </p><p>open what are in effect negotiations with the ICTY -- with </p><p>the press, the GOC and the Office of the President as </p><p>intermediaries -- on the modalities of an eventual surrender. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Osorio said the ICTY will not entertain Gotovina\'s </p><p>demand that the indictment against him be dropped or </p><p>suspended, even temporarily.  However, once he surrenders, </p><p>the OTP can proffer "face saving" options.  These included </p><p>launching a complete indictment review, in which Gotovina and </p><p>his legal team could participate, and rewording or dropping </p><p>elements of the indictment. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Separately, Osorio\'s deputy told us that they have </p><p>received no indication that the Croatian police have </p><p>developed new leads on Gotovina\'s whereabouts.  In a </p><p>statement to police on June 10, "Nacional" editor Pukanic </p><p>refused to disclose any details about where or when the </p><p>interview was conducted, other than to say that it was </p><p>outside Croatia  and that there were other "witnesses" </p><p>present. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Whatever his motivations for giving an interview -- </p><p>SFOR and IC pressure, a falling out with his right-wing </p><p>abettors or ennui of life as a fugitive -- Gotovina, by </p><p>acknowledging ICTY\'s jurisdiction, has embarrassed Croatia\'s </p><p>political right, which had made him the poster boy of </p><p>opposition to ICTY cooperation.  The GOC and President Mesic </p><p> </p><p>already have begun to make political hay of the interview, </p><p>hinting that had the HDZ facilitated Gotovina\'s interviewed </p><p>as a suspect in 1998, ICTY might have decided not to indict </p><p>him. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
