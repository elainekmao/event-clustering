<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004577 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: BIOS FOR NEW JORDANIAN CABINET MINISTERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 4533 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 4491 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman, per Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  The official Jordanian news agency, Petra, announced </p><p>21 July the release of a royal decree approving the new </p><p>government of Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb.  Five ministers </p><p>from the old cabinet have been removed, and eight new figures </p><p>have been brought in.  Of the newcomers, former jailed </p><p>lawmaker Samir Habashneh was made Interior Minister.  A </p><p>number of ministries were split, expanding the size of the </p><p>cabinet by three to 29 members. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  New members of the cabinet are: </p><p> </p><p>A.  (C)  Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs and </p><p>Minister of Administrative Development Mohammad Halaiqa: </p><p> </p><p>Muslim, West Banker.  Born in Shioukh in 1951, Halaiqa </p><p>obtained his B.Sc. in chemistry from the University of Jordan </p><p>in 1976 and a Ph.D. in industrial chemistry from University </p><p>of Leeds in the U.K.  At the Amman Chamber of Industry, he </p><p>served as director-general (1990-92) and director (1992-3). </p><p>He is past assistant secretary-general (1993-94) of the </p><p>Higher Council for Science and Technology and one-time </p><p>director-general of the Jordan Export Development Corporation </p><p>(1994-97).  From 1997 he was secretary-general of the </p><p>Ministry of Industry and Trade and later its Minister.  He </p><p>then served as Minister of State for National Economy. </p><p>Halaiqa also served as Jordan,s chief negotiator for </p><p>accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and is </p><p>generally regarded as one of the keenest economic minds in </p><p>the country.  The Embassy has a high opinion of his </p><p>professionalism, as demonstrated during successive rounds of </p><p>WTO talks. </p><p> </p><p>B.  (U)  Minister of State for Legal Affairs Abed Shakhanbeh: </p><p> </p><p>Muslim, East Banker.  Born in Madaba in 1950, Shakhanbeh </p><p>obtained his B.A. in law from Damascus University in 1971. </p><p>He earned his M.A. in law from the University of Jordan in </p><p>1987 and a Ph.D. from Cairo University in 1992.  He worked in </p><p>the Ministry of Justice from 1973 until 1992 when he was </p><p>appointed secretary-general of the Inspection and Control </p><p>Department.  For the past eight years, Shakhanbeh has served </p><p>as director of the department. </p><p> </p><p>C.  (U)  Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Tawfiq Kreishan: </p><p> </p><p>Muslim, East Banker.  Born in Ma an in 1947, Kreishan </p><p>obtained his B.Sc. in accounting and business administration </p><p>from the Arab University of Beirut in 1972.  He served as </p><p>director of the accounts department at the Jordan Petroleum </p><p>Refinery Company and, as a deputy in GOJ,s 12th Parliament </p><p>(1993-97), served as a member of the Foreign Affairs, </p><p>Agricultural and Water Affairs, and Rural and Badia Affairs </p><p>Committees.  He was Minister of Municipal, Rural, and </p><p>Environmental Affairs in 1994 and 1997. </p><p> </p><p>D.  (U)  Minister of the Interior Samir Habashneh: </p><p> </p><p>Muslim, East Banker.  Born in Bethlehem in 1951, Habashneh </p><p>earned his B.Sc. in Agricultural Engineering from Baghdad </p><p>University in 1974.  Upon graduation, he worked in the </p><p>cooperative society and then as a consultant at the Ministry </p><p>of Youth in 1992.  He became a deputy in the 12th Parliament </p><p>(1993-97) for Karak, was appointed Minister of Culture in </p><p>1995, and became a senator in 2001.  Habashneh was imprisoned </p><p>in 1976 for four years for links to a leftist group during a </p><p>ban on political parties.  He replaces Ghaftan Majali, </p><p>perhaps in response to allegations by the Islamic Action </p><p>Front (IAF) and unsuccessful candidates of irregularities in </p><p>the June 17 Parliamentary elections.  Others say his </p><p>appointment was aimed at easing anger toward a government </p><p>widely criticized for allegedly curbing public freedoms, </p><p>including restrictions on street protests in support of Iraq </p><p>and the Palestinians during the last three years.  (see ref A </p><p>for further commentary) </p><p> </p><p>E.  (C)  Minister of Information Dr. Nabil Sharif: </p><p> </p><p>Muslim, West Banker.  Born in Al Arish, Egypt, in 1952, </p><p>Sharif obtained his B.A. in English literature from Kuwait </p><p>University in 1977 and his M.A. and Ph.D. in the same field </p><p>from Indiana University (1981, 1982).  He taught English in </p><p>Kuwait in the late 1970s and was an assistant professor of </p><p>English literature first at Yarmouk University (1982-87) and </p><p>later at the University of Jordan (1987-91).  He worked as </p><p>the cultural affairs editor at Ad Dustour newspaper (1988-92) </p><p>and as a columnist for Jordan\'s Jerusalem Star (1985-88), </p><p>papers owned by the Sharif family.  For the past 15 years, he </p><p>has contributed a regular column to Ad Dustour and has been </p><p>its editor-in-chief since 1992.  He is the only Arab board </p><p>member of the Paris-based World Editors Forum and has </p><p>published a number of books in both English and Arabic. </p><p>Sharif is well known to the Embassy and can be characterized </p><p>as a secular leftist or pan-Arabist in his political outlook. </p><p> His paper has taken a generally critical stance toward U.S. </p><p>policies in the region, in particular during the war in Iraq </p><p>when his paper ran banner headlines in red accentuating the </p><p>resistance against U.S. forces and Iraqi civilian casualties. </p><p> He has expressed to PA offices a view that the government </p><p>should divest its media holdings and dismantle the Ministry </p><p>of Information as a way to encourage press freedom, but </p><p>Embassy does not anticipate much movement on those issues </p><p>even with him in the Minister\'s chair. </p><p>F.  (C)  Minister of Health Dr. Hakem Qadi: </p><p> </p><p>Muslim, East Banker.  Born in Mafraq in 1947, Qadi obtained </p><p>his B.Sc. M.Sc. in medicine in 1972 and 1974 from Ein Shams </p><p>University in Cairo.  He received his Ph.D. in the same field </p><p>from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and served at </p><p>the Royal Medical Services from 1972 until his retirement as </p><p>a major general in 2000.  Qadi, until his appointment, had </p><p>worked in a number of private hospitals and headed the King </p><p>Hussein Medical Center.  Qadi\'s service at the Center was, by </p><p>some accounts, undistinguished.  This is his first government </p><p>appointment.  (see ref A for further commentary) </p><p> </p><p>G.  (C)  Minister of Industry and Trade Dr. Mohammad Abu </p><p>Hammour: </p><p> </p><p>Muslim, East Banker.  Born in Salt in 1961, Abu Hammour </p><p>obtained his B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. in economics from </p><p>Yarmouk University (1984, 1990, 1997).  He worked at the </p><p>Central Bank of Jordan (1987-98) and the University of </p><p>Jordan, where he was a part-time lecturer and member of </p><p>committees discussing Master,s dissertations.  For several </p><p>years, he worked in a number of offices at the Finance </p><p>Ministry before becoming its secretary-general in late 2000 </p><p>-- a position which he held until his appointment.  Abu </p><p>Hammour is very well known to the embassy as a serious, if </p><p>perhaps not brilliant, financial technocrat.  He is extremely </p><p>hard working and was highly respected by the IMF in his </p><p>finance ministry job.  He is a master of budget management </p><p>and a strong supporter of economic reforms.  He has been </p><p>instrumental in successfully pushing the military pension </p><p>reform plan, balancing the political influence of the </p><p>military, and reducing the budget deficit to a sustainable </p><p>level. </p><p> </p><p>H.  (C)  Minister of Environment Dr. Hisham Gharaibeh: </p><p> </p><p>Muslim, East Banker.  Born in Irbid in 1948, Gharaibeh </p><p>obtained a B.Sc. from the Faculty of Commerce in Alexandria, </p><p>Egypt, in 1970.  He earned an M.B.A. and Ph.D. in business </p><p>administration from the University of Texas (1974, 1979).  He </p><p>served as a professor in administration and then became dean </p><p>of the economics and administrative sciences department.  He </p><p>worked as a consultant for the Arab Organization for </p><p>Administrative Development and as a consultant for several </p><p>Arab and international organizations, including the </p><p>International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Until his appointment, he </p><p>served as Vice-President of Yarmouk University from 2000. </p><p>Embassy feels that while his experience in matters of </p><p>environmental affairs is arguably limited, his extensive </p><p>managerial background may help the nascent ministry (formed </p><p>in January of this year) to develop the proper </p><p>infrastructure, personnel, and organizational chart. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Former National Economy Minister Samer Tawil was </p><p>made Minister of Tourism and Antiquities -* a portfolio that </p><p>he took over from Nader Dahabi, who until Sunday used to be </p><p>minister of both tourism and transport.  Dahabi retains only </p><p>the latter post.  Mohammad Adwan lost the Information </p><p>portfolio to Sharif but retained the post of Minister of </p><p>State for Political Affairs and acquired the new position of </p><p>Minister of State for Prime Ministry Affairs.  Rowaida </p><p>Maaitah, Minister of Social Development, remains the only </p><p>woman in the cabinet to the dismay of activists who hoped for </p><p>an increase in the number of women in government after the </p><p>introduction of a six-seat women\'s quota in the current Lower </p><p>House. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  In line with the tradition of sitting governments </p><p>stepping down after the election of a new Lower House of </p><p>Parliament, Abul Ragheb tendered his resignation on Sunday. </p><p>Parliament,s extraordinary session, which began 16 July, </p><p>will discuss a number of the 230 temporary laws passed by the </p><p>Abul Ragheb government during a two-year parliamentary hiatus. </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
