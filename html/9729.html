<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SANAA 001814 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, ETRD, EIND, ECON, YM, ET, COUNTER TERRORISM, ECON/COM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMENI PRESIDENT SALEH VISITS ETHIOPIA; MOVE TO </p><p>INCREASE TRILATERAL COOPERATION AMONG YEMEN-ETHIOPIA-SUDAN </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for reasons 1.5 (b and d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (c) In a July 27 meeting with the Ambassador, Foreign </p><p>Minister Qirbi said Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh,s </p><p>recent visit to Ethiopia paved the way for increasing </p><p>regional cooperation.  FM Qirbi deemed President Ali Abdullah </p><p>Saleh,s three day trip  successful in terms of strengthening </p><p>Yemeni-Ethiopian coordination on counter-terrorism, as well </p><p>as planning for economic development and increased trade.  He </p><p>claimed that the growing tripartite alliance that includes </p><p>the Sudan is not directed against any country, but is open to </p><p>all and designed to increase economic cooperation among the </p><p>HOA countries.  He also said that settling disputes by </p><p>peaceful means (e.g., in Somalia and the Sudan) would be a </p><p>major function of the alliance.  Noting that the Sudan and </p><p>Ethiopia already have a open trade zone and that the </p><p>Ethiopian market for Yemeni goods (oil and agricultural </p><p>products) is about $120 million, Qirbi said the goal is to </p><p>eventually have a Free Trade Area (FTA) and to develop a </p><p>common market.  The Ethiopian and Yemeni presidents also met </p><p>with businessmen to discuss improving the investment </p><p>environment. </p><p> </p><p>2. (c) The Ambassador mentioned General Robeson,s recent </p><p>visit to Yemen (septel), his interest in the HOA, training in </p><p>Yemen and other countries, and the possibility of future </p><p>regional exercises.  He also asked about Kenya,s inclusion </p><p>in the alliance.  According to Qirbi no other specific </p><p>countries or limitations on cooperation were discussed by the </p><p>presidents.  There is interest, however, in developing </p><p>stonger ties to Tanzania given the large Tanzanian population </p><p>in Yemen. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
