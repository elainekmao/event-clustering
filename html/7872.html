<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001177 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PREL, EAID, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: ANOTHER STEP FORWARD: FURTHER REDUCTION OF EMP </p><p>STAFF </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 GUATEMALA 3309 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: At a May 2 public event, President Portillo </p><p>officially demobilized 107 Presidential Guard (EMP) members </p><p>in the second phase of the peace accord-mandated process to </p><p>replace the EMP with a civilian agency.  The Ambassador </p><p>attended the ceremony at the National Cultural Palace, and </p><p>later discussed with the press the GOG\'s progress on peace </p><p>accord implementation, advocating prompt EMP dissolution and </p><p>other advances in the Peace Accord agenda.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) President Portillo announced on May 2 that the 107 </p><p>members of the EMP staff being retired would be absorbed by </p><p>other civilian agencies within the GOG.  Added to the first </p><p>staff reduction, which occurred on December 29, 2002 </p><p>(reftel), the EMP has now been reduced by 55 percent (204 </p><p>members) of its pre-Peace Accord size.  According to Portillo </p><p>and Peace Secretary Catalina Soberanis, the GOG will </p><p>demobilize the remainder of the EMP staff by October 31, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Ambassador attended the public ceremony along with </p><p>other chiefs of diplomatic missions.  After the event he told </p><p>the press that the demobilization of the EMP was a positive </p><p>sign of the GOG\'s commitment to fulfilling pending items on </p><p>the peace agenda.  He also expressed USG concern over the </p><p>lack of action so far towards completion of such peace accord </p><p>mandates as increasing the tax burden, creating a transparent </p><p>military budget, or increasing the budget of the Judiciary. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Ricardo Marroquin, director of the Secretariat for </p><p>Administrative Matters and Security (SAAS), the new civilian </p><p>agency tasked with taking over the bulk of the EMP\'s </p><p>functions, told PolMilOff that the former EMP members joining </p><p>his ranks were being very carefully screened before </p><p>admittance.  Marroquin also noted that he was pleased with </p><p>the transition thus far and that both he and the EMP staff </p><p>were on schedule to meet the October 31, 2003, demobilization </p><p>deadline. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) COMMENT: The continuing demobilization of the EMP is </p><p>encouraging, and has created expectations that the Portillo </p><p>Administration will meet its goal of completely demobilizing </p><p>the EMP and replacing it with a civilian agency by October. </p><p>While in recent years the EMP has not been accused of the </p><p>human rights abuses it was involved in during the internal </p><p>conflict, the total lack of transparency into its actions and </p><p>budget have led to concerns that it could be used, as it was </p><p>in the past, for corruption and even election-year dirty </p><p>tricks.  Its definitive departure later this year will be an </p><p>important step forward in the peace process. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
