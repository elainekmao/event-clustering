MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  12-30-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, MOPS, ECPS, CE, NO, LTTE - Peace Process, External Relations </p><p>SUBJECT:  President backs military on Jaffna security </p><p>zones; GSL defends role in import of equipment for LTTE </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  Colombo 2353, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Long Lee, Acting Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY:  President Kumaratunga has come out </p><p>strongly in favor of the Sri Lankan military\'s position </p><p>on the need to maintain "high security zones" in Jaffna. </p><p>For its part, the LTTE has announced that it wants to </p><p>discuss the security zone issue at the next round of </p><p>political-level talks.  In the meantime, the GSL has </p><p>issued a long document defending its role in the recent </p><p>import of radio equipment for the LTTE.  At this point, </p><p>despite real friction over the security zones, it is </p><p>positive that the GSL and the LTTE have so far indicated </p><p>a willingness to discuss the issue further.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Kumaratunga Enters the Fray </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) President Kumaratunga has come out strongly in </p><p>favor of the Sri Lankan military\'s position on the "high </p><p>security zones" in Jaffna.  (Note:  In a proposal </p><p>rejected by the LTTE late last week, the military </p><p>advocated that the zones only be opened to resettlement </p><p>if the LTTE agrees to strict conditions, including </p><p>disarming of any LTTE cadre entering them -- See </p><p>Reftels.  Mission is faxing SA/INS a map of the zones.) </p><p>Kumaratunga\'s involvement in the issue began late </p><p>December 27 when her office issued a press release </p><p>expressing concern about the LTTE\'s position and </p><p>announcing that she was cutting short her vacation in </p><p>order to return to Colombo to deal with the situation. </p><p>In dramatic tones, the statement ended by saying, "The </p><p>President\'s Office will keep the public further informed </p><p>as events unfold."  On December 28, Kumaratunga met Army </p><p>Commander Lt. General Balagalle and Major General </p><p>Fonseka, the Jaffna Army commander, to review the </p><p>matter.  According to leaks of what happened at the </p><p>meeting, Kumaratunga told the two that she was strongly </p><p>in support of the military\'s position that the security </p><p>zones were critical to the defense of Jaffna and should </p><p>not be dramatically reduced in size. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Queried about Kumaratunga\'s intervention, Jehan </p><p>Perera, the head of a local think-tank, told us that she </p><p>seemed to be "angling for cohabitation advantage." </p><p>Kumaratunga, he said, was clearly trying to create "a </p><p>crisis atmosphere" by warning the government that it </p><p>should not undermine the military\'s position by going </p><p>too far to accommodate the LTTE.  By publicizing her </p><p>position, Perera remarked that Kumaratunga had probably </p><p>"scored some political points" on the government.  He </p><p>thought that any damage to the GSL was limited, however, </p><p>as most people realized that the issue of the security </p><p>zones needed to be discussed with the LTTE.  It was not </p><p>enough simply to try to turn off debate, which was what </p><p>Kumaratunga seemed to be trying to do. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>LTTE Backs Further Discussion </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) After issuing its strongly worded rejection of </p><p>the military\'s proposal on the security zones (see </p><p>Reftel), the LTTE seems to be taking a more moderate </p><p>tack at this time.  In comments posted on the pro-LTTE </p><p>website "TamilNet" on December 29, LTTE senior </p><p>negotiator Anton Balasingham aimed some fire at the Sri </p><p>Lankan military, which he said was taking a "hard-line </p><p>attitude" on the security zone matter.  By taking its </p><p>stand, Balasingham asserted, the military was preventing </p><p>the resettlement of Tamil civilians in Jaffna.  That </p><p>said, Balasingham went on to stress that the LTTE was </p><p>still strongly in support of the peace process and </p><p>looked forward to discussing the security zone issue at </p><p>the January 6-9 round of talks in Thailand.  Queried </p><p>about a proposal put forward by the Sri Lanka Monitoring </p><p>Mission (SLMM), Balasingham said he did not know whether </p><p>a meeting of the Sub-Committee on De-Escalation and </p><p>Normalization focused on discussing the security zone </p><p>issue would "materialize."  He indicated that the LTTE </p><p>believed the sub-committee was "defunct," as it had </p><p>failed to make progress in solving the issue.  The group </p><p>now preferred to discuss the matter at the political- </p><p>level talks. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>GSL Defends Import of Radio Equipment </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Turning to another contentious issue, the </p><p>government has issued a long document explaining its </p><p>decision to allow the import of equipment upgrading the </p><p>LTTE\'s radio capabilities (See Reftels).  The document, </p><p>which received significant media coverage, stated that </p><p>the GSL allowed the import of the equipment only after </p><p>the LTTE agreed to apply for a license and to broadcast </p><p>subject to Sri Lankan government regulations.  The </p><p>document went on to note that:  "The public will </p><p>appreciate that the willingness of the LTTE to submit </p><p>itself to the authority of the government is a 180 </p><p>degree change from that which prevailed earlier when the </p><p>LTTE ran an illegal and unauthorized radio operation." </p><p>Responding to allegations that the Norwegian Embassy </p><p>should not have been involved in the import of the </p><p>equipment (it was consignee), the document made clear </p><p>that it was the GSL that asked the GoN to get involved </p><p>in the matter.  The document added that the Norwegians </p><p>only became involved when they became convinced that </p><p>helping facilitate the import of the equipment was in </p><p>the best interests of the peace process. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The government\'s document seems to have gone </p><p>some way in explaining to the public the circumstances </p><p>surrounding the import of the equipment.  Jehan Perera </p><p>said he thought that the controversy over the issue </p><p>would now die down to a large extent.  Perera added that </p><p>the government had handled the issue "clumsily" by not </p><p>taking the issue public earlier.  By its failure to get </p><p>its side of the story out earlier, the government had </p><p>also hurt the Norwegian facilitators, who had been made </p><p>to seem almost pro-LTTE by some elements in the press. </p><p>In a sign that the issue may not be going away soon, </p><p>Harim Peiris, a spokesman for President Kumaratunga, </p><p>told us that the government\'s explanation of its </p><p>involvement was "too little and too late."  Peiris added </p><p>that Kumaratunga wanted a "full accounting" and might </p><p>write to the Norwegian PM requesting an explanation of </p><p>the GoN role in the matter. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) As it tries to manage the blowups over the radio </p><p>equipment and Jaffna security zones, the GSL seems a bit </p><p>on the defensive.  With Kumaratunga and others hitting </p><p>out hard against the LTTE, the government is finding its </p><p>room for maneuver narrowing to some extent.  At this </p><p>point, however, it is positive that the GSL and the LTTE </p><p>have so far indicated a willingness to discuss the </p><p>security zone issue further, despite real friction over </p><p>how to resolve it.  Still acting in almost a binary </p><p>manner as far as the peace process is concerned, neither </p><p>side seems to want things to come to a crisis point </p><p>where they cannot negotiate a way out.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
