<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 NEW DELHI 006957 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS AND INR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 DECL: (1.6X1) </p><p>TAGS: KPRP, PINR, PTER, IN, PK </p><p>SUBJECT: JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (C-NA7-00565) </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 106548 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) CLASSIFIED SECRET BY NEW DELHI ACTING POLITICAL </p><p>COUNSELOR GORDON HELLWIG. REASON 1.5 (C). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) EMBASSY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE MORE INFORMATION ON </p><p>THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF) AS REQUESTED IN </p><p>REFTEL.  POST PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION, OBTAINED </p><p>BY THE REGIONAL SECURITY OFFICE THROUGH ITS CONTACTS IN THE </p><p>INDIAN INTELLIGENCE BUREAU IN THE HOME MINISTRY, WHICH </p><p>PROVIDED A WRITTEN REPORT ON THE JKIF.  POLOFFS HAVE HEARD </p><p>VERY LITTLE FROM CONTACTS IN KASHMIR VALLEY REGARDING THE </p><p>JKIF, AS MOST OF THEIR TERRORIST OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN </p><p>CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE VALLEY.  NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE </p><p>VARIOUS MILITANT GROUPS IN KASHMIR HAVE NEVER INCLUDED THE </p><p>JKIF AS A MILITANT GROUP OF PROMINENCE IN KASHMIR. </p><p> </p><p>BEGIN TEXT  (ENTIRE TEXT IS CONFIDENTIAL): </p><p> </p><p>JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF) </p><p> </p><p>THE GENESIS OF THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF) </p><p>DATES BACK TO 1989 WHEN ITS PRECURSOR, THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR </p><p>STUDENTS LIBERATION FRONT (JKSLF), WAS FLOATED BY HILAL BEG </p><p>FOLLOWING DIFFERENCES WITH YASIN MALIK, THE THEN COMMANDER- </p><p>IN-CHIEF OF JKLF.  THE JKSLF INDULGED IN HIGH-PROFILE </p><p>KIDNAPPING AND MURDER CASES.  LATER IN APRIL 1991, HILAL BEG </p><p>WAS PERSUADED BY PAKISTAN\'S INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE </p><p>DIVISION (ISI) TO RENAME THE JKSLF AS IKHWAN-UL-MUSALMEEN </p><p>(IUM).  THE IUM LED BY HILAL BEG WAS TASKED BY PAKISTAN ISI </p><p>TO CARRY OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE JAMMU AND KASHMIR. </p><p>FOR THIS PURPOSE, HILAL BEG CREATED A NETWORK OF HIS AGENTS </p><p>IN CALCUTTA, BIHAR, ANDHRA PRADESH, KATHMANDU, AND DHAKA. </p><p>THE ARREST OF FOUR MUSLIM TERRORISTS (INCLUDING 3 KASHMIRIS) </p><p>IN OCTOBER 1993 AT HYDERABAD AND CALCUTTA REVEALED THE PLANS </p><p>OF THE IUM TO STAGE BOMBAY-TYPE BLASTS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF </p><p>INDIA BY RECRUITING, TRAINING, AND ORGANISING GROUPS OF </p><p>SABOTEURS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>THE JKIF WAS FORMED IN SEPTEMBER 1995 BY ONE SAJJAD AHMED </p><p>KENU, WHO WAS A WELL-KNOWN ACTIVIST OF THE IUM.  SAJJAD KENU </p><p>HAD ESCAPED FROM SRINAGAR JAIL IN JUNE 1995 AND RESURFACED </p><p>AS THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE JKIF IN SEPTEMBER 1995. </p><p>SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE JKIF HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERABLE </p><p>PRESSURE FROM ITS PAKISTAN-BASED LEADERSHIP TO CARRY OUT </p><p>BOMB BLASTS OUTSIDE J&K, PARTICULARLY IN DELHI.  ON NOVEMBER </p><p>21, 1995, THE JKIF KINGPIN KHURSHEED AHMED, A.K.A. NAYEEM </p><p>(SINCE KILLED), ENGINEERED A HIGH INTENSITY BLAST WITH THE </p><p>HELP OF TWO SIKHS, NAMELY HARDEEP SINGH, A.K.A. NEELA, AND </p><p>HIS BROTHER RAJINDER, CLOTH VENDORS IN SRINAGAR.  THIS </p><p>EXPLOSION, IN THE CONNAUGHT PLACE AREA OF NEW DELHI, INJURED </p><p>23 PERSONS AND DAMAGED A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES AND SHOPS. </p><p>BEFORE THIS INCIDENT, ON SEPTEMBER 25, 1995, THE SAME SIKH </p><p>MILITANTS ALSO CAUSED TWO SIMULTANEOUS GRENADE EXPLOSIONS </p><p>NEAR THE RED FORT IN DELHI, INJURING 47 PERSONS.  THE JKIF </p><p>ALSO CAUSED ANOTHER EXPLOSION IN SADAR BAZAR, DELHI, ON </p><p>JANUARY 3, 1996, IN WHICH 7 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND 36 </p><p>INJURED. </p><p> </p><p>THE JKIF WAS CONTROLLED FROM PAKISTAN BY PAKISTAN ISI AND </p><p>TIGER MEMON (PRIME ACCUSED IN THE BOMBAY BOMB BLAST CASES OF </p><p>1993).  THEIR CONTACT IN PAKISTAN-OCCUPIED KASHMIR WAS BILAL </p><p>BEG, WHO WAS RUNNING AN INDOCTRINATION CAMP NEAR </p><p>MUZAFFARABAD, FUNDED EXTENSIVELY BY THE ISI TO CARRY OUT </p><p>TERRORIST ACTS IN INDIA, ONE COLONEL FAROOQ OF PAKISTAN ISI </p><p>TASKED BILAL BEG AND TIGER MEMON TO UTILISE KATHMANDU-BASED </p><p>ACTIVISTS LATEEF AND JAVED KRAWAH TO SET OFF BLASTS IN DELHI </p><p>BEFORE THE LOK SABHA [UPPER HOUSE OF THE INDIAN PARLIAMENT] </p><p>ELECTIONS.  A TEAM OF COMMITTED JKIF CADRES WAS GIVEN A TWO </p><p>WEEK SPECIALISED CAPSULE COURSE IN EXPLOSIVES NEAR THE </p><p>AFGHAN BORDER IN MARCH-APRIL 1996.  ON MAY 21, 1996, THIS </p><p>JKIF TEAM SET OFF A VERY HIGH INTENSITY EXPLOSION AT LAJPAT </p><p>NAGAR, NEW DELHI, IN WHICH 13 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND 40 </p><p>OTHERS INJURED.  THE RDX USED IN THIS BLAST WAS BROUGHT FROM </p><p>KATHMANDU.  ALTHOUGH OTHER ACCUSED, NAMELY FAROOQ KHAN, </p><p>A.K.A. ANWAR SADAT LATIF, JAVED CHHOTA, MEHMOOD KILLE, NAZA </p><p>(ALL KASHMIRIS) AND NAUSHAD (A DELHI MUSLIM) WERE ARRESTED, </p><p>JAVED KRAWAH AND RIAZ, A.K.A. RIAZ MULLA, MANAGED TO ESCAPE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE LATEST REPORTS, JAVED KRAWAH IS IN PAKISTAN </p><p>AT PRESENT.  THE SUBSEQUENT EXPLOSION IN A RAJASTHAN </p><p>ROADWAYS BUS NEAR DAUSA ON MAY 22, 1996 WAS ALSO ENGINEERED </p><p>BY THE JKIF.  ANOTHER JKIF TEAM UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>ABDUL GANI, A.K.A. ASSADULLAH, WAS SENT TO EXECUTE A BOMB </p><p>BLAST IN AHMEDABAD.  THE BLAST WAS PREVENTED BY THE TIMELY </p><p>ARREST OF TEAM MEMBERS IN AHMEDABAD AND THE SEIZURE OF THEIR </p><p>HIGH GRADE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL. </p><p> </p><p>JKIF AGAIN PLANNED A CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS IN DELHI BEFORE </p><p>REPUBLIC DAY 1997 AT THE BEHEST OF PAKISTAN ISI AND TIGER </p><p>MEMON.  ONE FAIYAZ AHMED SHAH, A.K.A. FAROOQ, TASKED BY </p><p>BILAL AHMED BEG AND JAVED KRAWAH IN PAKISTAN, WAS GIVEN 20 </p><p>KG OF RDX AND MONEY IN KATHMANDU.  BEFORE HE COULD EXECUTE </p><p>THE PLAN, FAIYAZ AHMED SHAH, A.K.A. FAROOQ, ALONG WITH </p><p>GHULAM RASOOL MIR, A.K.A. GOGA, AIJAZ AHMED CHOUDHARY, NAZIR </p><p>AHMED, AND MANZOOR AHMED DANPOSH, A.K.A. JAN, WERE ARRESTED </p><p>IN KATHMANDU ON DECEMBER 11, 1996. </p><p> </p><p>FOR ALL THESE VIOLENT ACTIVITIES, THE JKIF HAS BEEN </p><p>EXTENSIVELY USING KATHMANDU AS ITS BASE WITH THE ACTIVE </p><p>CONNIVANCE OF PAKISTAN ISI.  TO DISPATCH MEN AND MATERIAL, </p><p>AND TO EXECUTE EXPLOSIONS IN INDIA, KATHMANDU WAS INVARIABLY </p><p>MADE THE NODAL POINT AND JKIF EXPLOITED THE VULNERABLE </p><p>KATHMANDU-BASED KASHMIRI BUSINESSMEN FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES </p><p>SINCE THEY HAD A READYMADE AND CLEAN PAST.  JKIF KINGPIN </p><p>JAVED KRAWAH HIMSELF USED TO RUN A CARPET BUSINESS IN </p><p>KATHMANDU. </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT </p><p> </p><p>WISNER </p><p></p></div>
