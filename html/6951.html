(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Alright for </p><p>reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Summary: Red Crescent Authority (RCA) </p><p>Secretary General San\'a Al-Kitbi confirmed to </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Econchief on March 29 that RCA had sent three </p><p>delegations to Iraq during the last two months, the </p><p>most recent of which traveled to Iraq overland from </p><p>Jordan on March 23.  Highlighting the dangers of </p><p>humanitarian operations in Iraq, Al-Kitbi claimed that </p><p>-- despite clearances from the Jordanian and Iraqi Red </p><p>Crescent Societies -- the March 23 convoy of three, </p><p>clearly-marked vehicles came under Coalition small- </p><p>arms fire as it traveled overland towards Baghdad. </p><p>The group nonetheless was able to reach Baghdad (one </p><p>driver sustained minor injuries), where RCA officials </p><p>visited a number of hospitals and orphanages, </p><p>delivering blankets and medicine to the Iraqi Red </p><p>Crescent Society.  Al-Kitbi stressed that the RCA </p><p>would not publicize the alleged incident, but was </p><p>interested in guidance on ways to ensure better </p><p>deconfliction and asked whether the ICRC could serve </p><p>this purpose since the RCA is reluctant to deal </p><p>directly with governmental/military authorities. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Summary, continued:  The RCA Secretary-General </p><p>also requested a response from the USG with regard to </p><p>permission for the UAE Red Crescent to deliver </p><p>humanitarian aid to needy Iraqis -- wherever they may </p><p>be.  She noted that while the Iraqi regime would </p><p>likely reject aid convoys from Saudi Arabian and </p><p>Kuwaiti charities, the UAE Red Crescent believes it </p><p>can get permission to pass through Iraqi lines.  Would </p><p>the Coalition military authorities permit this to get </p><p>aid to desperate Iraqi civilians?  As her final point, </p><p>Al-Kitbi requested Post\'s assistance in facilitating a </p><p>large shipment of humanitarian supplies to Umm Qasr. </p><p>(Note:  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs </p><p>Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan told the Ambassador </p><p>on March 28 that getting this shipment to Iraq is a </p><p>top priority for the UAEG.  End Note.)  Econchief </p><p>stressed the importance of coordination for the safety </p><p>of all involved, and noted that while Umm Qasr is </p><p>currently closed to civilian shipping, this may change </p><p>in the next few days.  Subsequent to this meeting, </p><p>Econchief informed CENTCOM of the March 23 incident </p><p>near Baghdad, and initiated coordination between the </p><p>RCA and the Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) in </p><p>Kuwait to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian </p><p>supplies to Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>RCA Workers Enter Iraq To Distribute Aid... </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) According to Red Crescent Authority Secretary- </p><p>General San\'a Al-Kitbi, during a March 23-28 visit to </p><p>Iraq, an RCA delegation (working in partnership with </p><p>UNICEF) visited a number of hospitals and orphanages </p><p>to deliver emergency medical supplies and high-calorie </p><p>milk and biscuits valued at 500,000 AED ($136,000 </p><p>USD).  (Note:  They also delivered supplies of </p><p>blankets and medicine to the cities of Basra, Najaf, </p><p>and Mosul through the Iraqi Red Crescent Society, </p><p>according to press reports.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Al-Kitbi noted that the delegation also </p><p>distributed 20,000 loaves of bread to more than 5,000 </p><p>families in Baghdad.  The RCA hired local bakers to </p><p>make the bread and contracted with regional flourmills </p><p>to obtain the necessary ingredients.  RCA also </p><p>purchased 1,000 head of sheep and goats for slaughter, </p><p>and distributed the meat to needy Iraqi families. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>...But Experience The Dangers Of War First-Hand </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Al-Kitbi reported to Econchief that the three </p><p>vehicle convoy traveling overland from Jordan came </p><p>under alleged Coalition small arms fire nearly 60 </p><p>kilometers outside of Baghdad, although the delegation </p><p>traveled in clearly marked Red Crescent vehicles with </p><p>diplomatic plates.  The vehicles were armored and the </p><p>delegation came through largely unscathed, although </p><p>one driver was lightly wounded.  Al-Kitbi noted that </p><p>RCA had coordinated the visit with the UAE embassies </p><p>in Amman and Baghdad, working with the Iraqi and </p><p>Jordanian Red Crescent Societies and the ICRC.  She </p><p>had assumed that these entities had obtained the </p><p>necessary clearances from the Iraqi Government and the </p><p>U.S. military to allow safe passage for the aid </p><p>workers.  The RCA had no intention of publicizing the </p><p>incident, but would appreciate guidance on how to </p><p>prevent future such incidents (here Al-Kitbi noted </p><p>that, in general, the RCA prefers to coordinate via </p><p>non-governmental organizations, if that is possible). </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S) Al-Kitbi noted that Iraqi authorities had </p><p>urged the RCA to travel overland from Syria, as this </p><p>was a "safer and shorter" route, but the RCA </p><p>ultimately decided this was a bad idea.  Econchief </p><p>noted recent public statements by Secretary of Defense </p><p>Rumsfeld regarding military resupply of Iraq via </p><p>Syria.  Al-Kitbi smiled and again reiterated that the </p><p>RCA had ultimately decided not to do what had been so </p><p>strongly recommended by the Iraqis. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Eager To Move More Aid To Iraq -- Fast... </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Al-Kitbi confirmed that a RCA ship hoped to </p><p>depart soon for Umm Qasr in Iraq loaded with 1,000- </p><p>2,000 boxes (35 kilos each) of basic foodstuffs.  Al- </p><p>Kitbi presented a sample box containing sugar, dates, </p><p>pasta, milk, oil, cans of beans, baby formula, and </p><p>water to Econchief for examination.  Al-Kitbi </p><p>requested Post\'s assistance in facilitating the </p><p>shipment, but noted that the RCA could ship to </p><p>Kuwait\'s Mina Al-Shuwaikh and the supplies trucked 60 </p><p>kilometers overland to Iraq if it encountered problems </p><p>entering Umm Qasr. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>...And Where It Is Needed Most </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Al-Kitbi stressed that the RCA wants to </p><p>deliver its aid directly, not warehouse supplies for </p><p>subsequent delivery by others.  She also noted that </p><p>the RCA has as its mandate helping the neediest of the </p><p>needy; to that end, the RCA would like to receive </p><p>permission from the coalition to cross the lines and </p><p>deliver aid in regime-controlled territory.  The RCA </p><p>official stated that while the Iraqi authorities were </p><p>not likely to permit Kuwaiti or Saudi charities to </p><p>perform these activities, the UAE RCA has a long </p><p>history of working closely and cooperatively with its </p><p>Iraqi counterparts.  No official request has yet been </p><p>made, Al-Kitbi observed, but a positive response from </p><p>the Coalition side would clear the way for an approach </p><p>to be made to Baghdad.  Econchief responded that we </p><p>welcome the efforts of the RCA and will do all we can </p><p>to facilitate the delivery of aid to the needy in </p><p>Iraq.  While Umm Qasr is currently closed to civilian </p><p>shipping, that situation could change shortly.  We </p><p>will work closely with the HOC in Kuwait to get </p><p>answers as soon as possible.  Econchief noted that </p><p>continued close cooperation and sharing of information </p><p>would be vital to a successful effort; Al-Kitbi said </p><p>she welcomed such an exchange on an ongoing basis. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) The UAE Red Crescent Society is well- </p><p>financed, enjoys good operational contacts inside </p><p>Iraq, and is eager to play a role in getting </p><p>humanitarian aid to the Iraqis who need it most.  Post </p><p>is grateful for the initial positive responses we have </p><p>received from the HOC to our various requests; </p><p>facilitating UAE RCA operations, in our view, will </p><p>well serve both our immediate humanitarian goals as </p><p>well our longer-term policy objectives.  To that end, </p><p>we will continue to work closely with the RCA and will </p><p>report on its activities as appropriate. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
