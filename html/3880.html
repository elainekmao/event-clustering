<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 001925 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALI PM ASKS KING TO POSTPONE ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 1901 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 1781 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Sources at the Palace have informed the Ambassador </p><p>that on October 3 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, citing </p><p>the King\'s broadly worded authority under Clause 127 of the </p><p>Constitution to remedy "difficulties" arising in the </p><p>implementation of the Constitution, requested King Gyanendra </p><p>to postpone mid-term elections scheduled for November 13. </p><p>The Prime Minister was acting on the all-party </p><p>recommendation, formulated September 30, that the security </p><p>situation is too perilous to permit electons at this time </p><p>(Ref A). The Palace said the King will consult with </p><p>Constitutional experts and leaders of other political parties </p><p>before responding to the request.  The same source indicated </p><p>that the King will likely meet with the Ambassador October 4. </p><p> (Note:  The King met with former Opposition Leader Madhav </p><p>Nepal and former Prime Minister G.P. Koirala October 2.  End </p><p>note.)  A source at the Prime Minster\'s Office has told us </p><p>that the PM requested the polling date be deferred until </p><p>November 19, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Comment:  There appears to be a substantial </p><p>difference of expert opinion regarding the legality of </p><p>postponing elections.  The King is thus well advised to seek </p><p>the opinion of Constitutional experts before acting.  Members </p><p>of other political parties--including the Communist Party of </p><p>Nepal - United Marxist Leninist (UML)--have told us their </p><p>party would participate in an interim government--even one </p><p>headed by the Prime Minister.  The notable exception is </p><p>long-time Deuba rival and former Prime Minister G.P. Koirala, </p><p>who rescinded his party\'s endorsement of the all-party </p><p>recommendation a mere one day after it was issued.  If all </p><p>other political parties jump on the interim government </p><p>bandwagon--and start divvying up the more desirable </p><p>portfolios--G.P. may well find himself isolated. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
