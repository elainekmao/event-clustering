<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002620 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CNEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ELAB, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC MASS ACTION: NEXT STEPS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: polchief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>Mass Action </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>1.   (C)  Gandi Mudzingwa, special advisor to MDC leader </p><p>Morgan Tsvangirai, told polchief on November 20 that planning </p><p>for mass action is consuming most of his time and attention. </p><p>One element of the MDC\'s efforts on this front, he reported, </p><p>had occurred on November 14, when groups of 20 women each had </p><p>converged on police stations in Harare\'s high-density suburbs </p><p>to deliver a petition demanding that the people\'s human </p><p>rights be respected.  They invited the police to join them in </p><p>a prayer seeking divine assistance in extricating Zimbabwe </p><p>from its difficulties.  Mudzingwa said some of the women were </p><p>arrested on minor charges, such as obstructing traffic, but </p><p>that most of them were not, and police at some stations even </p><p>agreed to join in the prayer.  The objective of this action </p><p>was to help people overcome their fear of the police and to </p><p>provide a peaceful method for residents to express their </p><p>increasing anger and frustration. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Mudzingwa told us that the MDC is working closely </p><p>with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) to organize </p><p>a one-day national work stayaway on December 9.   The ZCTU, </p><p>he said, planned to announce the stayaway only "a couple of </p><p>days" in advance, so that the GOZ would not have significant </p><p>lead time in which to disrupt the action.  If the stayaway is </p><p>successful, Mudzingwa said the MDC would then "go for the </p><p>jugular."  Asked what he meant by that, Mudzingwa replied </p><p>that the next activity would be designed to force Mugabe from </p><p>office, but he declined to be drawn on what sort of activity </p><p>was being contemplated. </p><p> </p><p>Tsvangirai-Mbeki letter </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Mudzingwa told us that, the week of November 11, he </p><p>had personally met in South Africa with officials in the </p><p>office of South African President Thabo Mbeki to deliver a </p><p>letter from Morgan Tsvangirai to Mbeki.  The letter (the text </p><p>of which is conveyed septel) welcomes South African </p><p>engagement on Zimbabwe but expresses concern that the failure </p><p>of several recent visiting SAG delegations to engage with the </p><p>MDC "compromises your image as an impartial broker."  The </p><p>letter was particularly critical of recent public remarks by </p><p>Foreign Minister Zuma during her recent visit to Zimbabwe and </p><p>emphasizes the necessity of solving Zimbabwe\'s political </p><p>crisis.  "The Zimbabwe crisis is real and needs resolution </p><p>rather than management," Tsvangirai wrote. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Mudzingwa clearly believes that pressure in the form </p><p>of mass action stands the best chance of resolving Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>political crisis.  Judging from the November 14 effort at </p><p>peacefully targeting police stations, the MDC appears to be </p><p>proceeding very carefully in this direction, engaging in </p><p>small-scale forms of protest that provide an outlet for party </p><p>supporters while avoiding triggering the wrath of GOZ </p><p>security services.  A successful one-day stayaway would </p><p>demonstrate the ability of the labor movement to shut down </p><p>the country while avoiding the imposition of too heavy an </p><p>economic burden on workers who are already struggling to make </p><p>ends meet.  We are discreetly checking with our ZCTU sources </p><p>to learn more about the status of organizing efforts and will </p><p>then be able to provide a better assessment of the chances of </p><p>success and possible consequences. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) The Tsvangirai-Mbeki letter reveals an increasing </p><p>frustration in MDC circles that President Mbeki is more </p><p>interested in helping assuage Zimbabwe\'s economic implosion </p><p>than in brokering a sustainable resolution of the political </p><p>crisis which is responsible for it. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
