From 26 April to 13 June, DART Team West traveled </p><p>thousands of miles in Iraq, conducting assessments, liaising </p><p>with local Coalition forces and Coalition Provisional </p><p>Authority (CPA) personnel, identifying and funding emergency </p><p>and community activities, facilitating humanitarian </p><p>assistance, and encouraging the respect of human rights. </p><p>DART Team West\'s area of responsibility (AOR) was Al Anbar, </p><p>Babil, Karbala, An Najaf, Al Qadisiyah, Wasit, and Al </p><p>Muthanna governorates.  By mid-June, the team found </p><p>conditions in its seven western and south central </p><p>governorates to be near or at pre-war levels in the major </p><p>sectoral areas of water, sanitation, food, and health.  DART </p><p>Team West has also observed reduced fuel lines, improved </p><p>security, and reopened schools.  DART Team West witnessed </p><p>and supported the resurgence of local judiciaries and the </p><p>birth of human rights organizations in at least five of the </p><p>governorates.  With DART Team West assistance, the Public </p><p>Distribution System (PDS) resumed in June with only minor </p><p>problems, thus allaying fears of disruptions to the food </p><p>ration system that feeds the majority of Iraq\'s population. </p><p>In close collaboration with DART Team West, NGO cooperative </p><p>agreement partners have begun executing emergency response </p><p>activities in each of the seven AOR governorates.  In the </p><p>last several weeks, DART Team West has observed a growing </p><p>emergence of non-governmental organization (NGO) and </p><p>international organization (IO) involvement in responding to </p><p>regional humanitarian problems.  Several United Nations </p><p>agencies will be based regionally in Al Hillah by the end of </p><p>June.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Food Security </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   The Public Distribution System (PDS) continues to </p><p>supply Iraqi beneficiaries in the west and south central </p><p>governorates with full food rations during June without </p><p>major disruptions.  DART Team West conducted the following </p><p>food-security site visits: Al Hillah (daily), Karbala </p><p>(thrice), An Najaf (thrice), Ad Diwaniyah (twice), As </p><p>Samawah (once), and Al Kut (once).  However, DART Team West </p><p>was unable to visit the capital of Al Anbar governorate, Ar </p><p>Ramadi, due to insecurity, but it did visit several cities </p><p>elsewhere in the governorate. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Reports from the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) and the </p><p>Ministry of Trade (MOT) in DART Team West\'s AOR stated that </p><p>food supplies are arriving regularly from the major supply </p><p>pipeline corridors, and local food agents are collecting </p><p>commodities for distribution.  All relevant pipeline </p><p>dispatch data is maintained and distributed by WFP. </p><p>The first post-conflict food distributions began on or about </p><p>1 June in the south-central region through the operational </p><p>and monitoring support of WFP, MOT, the Coalition forces, </p><p>and USAID.  WFP is the lead agency providing oversight and </p><p>management support to the MOT and has established national </p><p>PDS teams in each governorate capital, as well as a WFP area </p><p>office in Al Hillah. </p><p>As expected, some PDS anomalies have developed, some endemic </p><p>in the south-central region, some isolated to a particular </p><p>governorate.  Most of these issues have been, or continue to </p><p>be, resolved through collaborative and persistent efforts </p><p>among the WFP, DART, MOT, and Coalition Civil Affairs (CA) </p><p>staffs. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Areas of Food Security Concerns </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   As the June distributions continue, DART Team West has </p><p>identified several minor areas of concern that could present </p><p>future hindrances in managing an efficient PDS: </p><p> </p><p>Communications: Links between the MOT offices in Baghdad and </p><p>the MOT offices in each governorate need to be </p><p>strengthened.  MOT warehouse managers, silo managers, grain </p><p>board managers and re-registration/ration center managers do </p><p>not have communication capabilities to receive instructions </p><p>from, or communicate inquiries to, a central authority. The </p><p>lack of adequate communication hampers the resolution of key </p><p>PDS issues including: </p><p> </p><p>-- Instructions regarding the program for the reception, </p><p>payment, and storage of locally grown wheat; </p><p> </p><p>-- Instructions to food agents, through MOT representatives, </p><p>on transportation cost reimbursements, and any changes in </p><p>distribution procedures; </p><p> </p><p>-- Instructions to MOT managers on procedures to provide </p><p>overtime payments for appropriate warehouse and silo </p><p>workers; and </p><p> </p><p>-- Instructions to MOT on general financial management </p><p>procedures to manage operation funds, particularly with </p><p>respect to the current $50,000 disbursement for MOT </p><p>operations. </p><p> </p><p>Communication should flow in both directions and MOT should </p><p>be able to consider the various governorate problems and </p><p>react accordingly.  As the PDS becomes more reliable and </p><p>less dependent on WFP in the coming months, MOT will need to </p><p>communicate to the governorate offices on a regular basis, </p><p>making timely communication an important part of efficient </p><p>food delivery. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Collaboration: MOT management personnel need to </p><p>understand the importance of collaboration and cooperation </p><p>in conducting the business of the PDS during this initial </p><p>phase of start up.  The MOT must cooperate more fully with </p><p>WFP national staff requests to improve management methods or </p><p>resolve problems.  DART Team West reports that in several </p><p>governorates, MOT management have made commitments with WFP </p><p>area office staff or WFP international staff, yet were </p><p>reluctant to make changes or implement the required actions </p><p>for improvement.  As the PDS continues, MOT personnel need </p><p>to understand the importance of implementing required </p><p>changes to the PDS management.  Establishing this precedent </p><p>now will become a key aspect of future changes in PDS as </p><p>Iraq becomes more economically stable and PDS phase-out </p><p>plans develop. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Re-registering Beneficiaries: The June distribution </p><p>will probably reveal weaknesses in the PDS.  Some of these </p><p>weaknesses are known, others will be learned, but one </p><p>probable concern will be identifying those Iraqi citizens </p><p>that have fallen out of the PDS.  Although the MOT re- </p><p>registration/ration centers are vigorously re-registering </p><p>beneficiaries in all the governorates, there will be </p><p>marginalized groups, such as prisoners of war, released </p><p>prisoners, refugee returnees, internally displaced persons </p><p>(IDPs), and others that missed the June ration for various </p><p>reasons.  WFP will be monitoring distributions at the </p><p>beneficiary level, but will need strong cooperation from MOT </p><p>in order to address the PDS needs of those groups and </p><p>individuals that missed the June distribution and to assure </p><p>they are included in the PDS for future distributions. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Working Parameters: It is important to reiterate DART </p><p>Team West\'s position within the current Coalition </p><p>Provisional Authority (CPA) structure in Al Hillah.  DART </p><p>Team West has performed a variety of reporting and liaison </p><p>activities among the different agencies working within the </p><p>PDS in this AOR and will continue to do so. (Note:  With </p><p>DART Team West\'s departure from Al Hillah on June 13, a new </p><p>DART Team South has been positioned in Al Hillah to continue </p><p>humanitarian monitoring and programming activities for Al </p><p>Anbar, Babil, Karbala, An Najaf, Al Qadisiyah, Wasit, Al </p><p>Muthanna, Maysan, Dhi Qar and Al Basrah governorates.  End </p><p>Note.)  The working relationships developed with CPA and </p><p>military Civil Affairs units within DART Team West\'s AOR </p><p>have been successful, in part, because of the understanding </p><p>that DART Team West operates and reports within the </p><p>parameters established earlier by USAID and CPA.  DART Team </p><p>West\'s independence in determining priority activities and </p><p>maintaining its reporting responsibilities is key to its </p><p>value to ongoing operations in its AOR and imperative for </p><p>its continued success in the region.  South central CPA has </p><p>been very supportive of these conditions and the new DART </p><p>Team South looks forward to continuing a strong and </p><p>productive relationship with CPA in Al Hillah under these </p><p>same conditions. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Human Rights and Protection </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.   Mass Graves: Dozens of mass graves have been uncovered </p><p>since the fall of the former regime.  Most of these mass </p><p>graves are a direct result of the killings that occurred in </p><p>1991 when Shiite Muslims were massacred by Iraqi military </p><p>forces after their uprising and buried within are the </p><p>remains of men, women, and children.  Residents had been </p><p>using their hands, shovels, and tractors to excavate the </p><p>bodies.  Community members, who have been working at these </p><p>sites and have been looking for the remains of family </p><p>members, claim that most bodies had either been shot or </p><p>buried alive; some had been tortured, and others were bound </p><p>and blindfolded prior to being killed. </p><p> </p><p>9.   The community has been able to identify remains in </p><p>three ways:  by photo identification (ID) card, by another </p><p>ID card with a personal number (similar to a social security </p><p>card), and by personal items such as clothing, jewelry, </p><p>etc.  Bodies not yet identified are either put in piles or </p><p>in plastic bags (two to three bodies per bag).  In some </p><p>areas, the non-identified remains have been re-buried. </p><p>Community members are eager to find the remains of their </p><p>loved ones in order to provide a proper Shiite religious </p><p>burial.  However, in many instances, they have agreed to </p><p>leave these gravesites untouched until proper forensics </p><p>teams can examine the areas and recover the remains </p><p>appropriately.  For the most part, the community understands </p><p>that uncoordinated exploitation of gravesites diminishes the </p><p>probability of identifying the missing and may fail to </p><p>preserve evidence that could bring perpetrators to justice. </p><p>"INFORCE", a British forensics team, is beginning its </p><p>assessments of the various gravesites in the region. </p><p>Exhumations thus far by the local community continue to be </p><p>relatively organized. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Human Rights Societies: There is an obvious absence of </p><p>civil-society groups in the south-central region.  Ba\'ath </p><p>Party members had controlled most, if not all, of these </p><p>groups (including the National Federation of Iraqi Women and </p><p>local youth groups) during the former regime.  After the end </p><p>of the recent conflict, human rights societies were stood up </p><p>(mainly through the local lawyers\' associations) in most of </p><p>the governorates, according to many of the Coalition Civil </p><p>Affairs units with whom DART Team West spoke.  Iraqis were </p><p>eager to monitor, prevent, and respond to past and current </p><p>human rights abuses.  Many explained they had been waiting </p><p>for years to reclaim their rights and freedom. </p><p> </p><p>11.  DART Team West visited local human rights societies in </p><p>Al Hillah, Karbala, and An Najaf.  Much of the work these </p><p>organizations are doing is quite impressive.  The </p><p>initiatives include: educating their communities on rights- </p><p>based approaches to conflict and violence; working on de- </p><p>mining and unexploded ordnance (UXO) prevention; locating </p><p>mass graves and assisting the community in identification of </p><p>loved ones; locating prisoners of war and missing soldiers; </p><p>and recording war damages for future compensation.  These </p><p>societies are also using local television, radio, and </p><p>newsletters to educate local and international communities </p><p>about their efforts.  However, despite all of the work that </p><p>these societies are accomplishing, there is a potential </p><p>problem that can hamper their effectiveness.  Communication </p><p>is quite difficult with many of these societies not having </p><p>working phones, and if they do, they can often only be </p><p>operational within their local area.  This limits the amount </p><p>of communication the societies can have with one another, </p><p>leading to potential tension among one another, as there is </p><p>a lack of standardization of activities and no clear </p><p>headquarters. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Retribution/Revenge:  There is evidence of small </p><p>pockets of hostility with regard to revenge and retribution </p><p>in communities in the south central region.  However, with </p><p>the help of religious leaders, human rights societies, and </p><p>Coalition forces, these incidents have not escalated to a </p><p>dangerous level.  For example, aides to a highly respected </p><p>Shiite religious leader distributed a flier that admonished </p><p>against any revenge violence and emphasized the need to work </p><p>through proper judicial systems.  As long as the insecurity </p><p>issue continues, however, the potential for escalating </p><p>violence among Iraqis will increase. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Human Rights and Protection: Next Steps </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  DART Baghdad, DART Team South and DART Team North will </p><p>need to continue to monitor human rights and protection </p><p>issues in all of Iraq\'s 18 governorates.  DART Team West is </p><p>providing a list of next steps for DART Baghdad, DART Team </p><p>South and DART Team North staff to use: </p><p> </p><p>-- Continue to monitor and report any human rights incidents </p><p>to proper Coalition forces, CPA, appropriate United Nations </p><p>agencies, and to Iraqi human rights societies and relevant </p><p>authorities; </p><p> </p><p>-- Continue liaising with the local community on the mass </p><p>graves issue and ensure that organizations involved in </p><p>protection and exhumation keep the communities informed of </p><p>their activities and involved in any decision-making; and </p><p> </p><p>-- Provide human rights societies with the necessary </p><p>capacity to enhance their work, including formal training on </p><p>human rights monitoring and on the Geneva Conventions, as </p><p>well as on organizational management.  Many also need basic </p><p>"office in a box" assistance in order to continue their good </p><p>work and to begin to forge links with other local and </p><p>international human rights groups. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Assistance to Vulnerable Groups </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  During the former regime, there was a small amount of </p><p>assistance provided to vulnerable groups such as the poor, </p><p>IDPs, widows, orphans, elderly, and the handicapped.  The </p><p>Ministry of Labor and Social Services had provided a small </p><p>stipend to many of these individuals depending on family </p><p>size.  In Al Hillah, for example, the Ministry had provided </p><p>its last quarterly payment of 15,000 to 22,500 Iraqi dinars </p><p>(1,500 Iraqi dinars = USD 1) in December 2002.  These groups </p><p>are already in a very vulnerable position.  Any long-term </p><p>delay in assistance will exacerbate their vulnerabilities </p><p>and will create undue hardships that can be avoided. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Despite what some may claim, many women and children </p><p>are treated as second-class citizens in Iraq.  It will take </p><p>time for women to reach an appropriate standard of living </p><p>and gain full access to basic services.  Their own </p><p>vulnerabilities are apparent, and it is critical to focus on </p><p>their exigencies, especially education, health, and </p><p>political participation.  Child labor is rife in Iraq, and </p><p>participation in post-primary education is not a certainty, </p><p>particularly for girls.  Poor economic conditions and </p><p>cultural norms weigh heavily on childhood opportunities. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Protection of Vulnerable Groups: Next Steps </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  DART Baghdad, DART Team South and DART Team North will </p><p>need to continue to monitor the protection of Iraq\'s </p><p>vulnerable groups.  The DART teams should: </p><p> </p><p>-- Ensure assistance to vulnerable groups is included in </p><p>CPA strategies and plans (short and long-term); </p><p> </p><p>-- Gather more information on the numbers and composition of </p><p>vulnerable groups in each governorate; and </p><p> </p><p>-- Guarantee these vulnerable groups are being assisted in </p><p>the short and long-term through NGOs, IOs, and/or CPA </p><p>initiatives and programs. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Refugee Returns </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  In preparation for possible repatriations to the south </p><p>central region of Iraq, DART Team West discussed refugee </p><p>repatriation issues with local leadership, NGOs, and WFP in </p><p>its AOR govern orates.  Overall, most basic service sectors </p><p>are up and running in the larger cities including water, </p><p>electricity, security, food, and health.  When asked if </p><p>refugees would be easily accepted back into the community, </p><p>most residents seemed supportive of returning Iraqis who </p><p>have either been expatriates, IDPs, or refugees, as long as </p><p>they bring skills that can help improve the governorates </p><p>where they relocate. If returnees have an identification </p><p>card that shows they are returning Iraqi citizens, they are </p><p>able to register with the governorate\'s ration center for a </p><p>food ration card.  While many of the urban sectors in the </p><p>south-central region are functioning at pre-war levels, </p><p>rural areas continue to lack proper electricity and water </p><p>and, in many cases, security, health, and sanitation are </p><p>below standard requirements. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee Returns: Next Steps </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  For refugee returns to be successful in Iraq: </p><p> </p><p>-- It will be critical to understand the makeup of these </p><p>returning refugees, including the number of extremely </p><p>vulnerable individuals, the breakdown of urban and rural </p><p>inhabitants, the composition of families, the numbers of </p><p>males and females, and the percentage with family or </p><p>relative support networks; </p><p> </p><p>-- Refugee repatriation should begin with a small number of </p><p>returnees and with those who have local host family support; </p><p>and </p><p> </p><p>-- Security will be an issue and assisting organizations, </p><p>such as UNHCR, should liaise and inform Coalition forces, </p><p>NGOs, and local community leaders to ensure that returnees </p><p>will have adequate assistance during the first few days of </p><p>relocation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Transition Activities </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  With the arrival in Al Hillah this past week of the </p><p>Office of Transition Initiatives\' (OTI) implementing </p><p>partner, the International Organization for Migration, many </p><p>projects already identified by Team West\'s OTI Officer are </p><p>expected to commence.  Other possible OTI projects will also </p><p>be considered for funding.  The Al Hillah projects include </p><p>office, communications, and computer equipment for the Human </p><p>Rights Association of Al Hillah and the Babil governorate </p><p>courthouse.  These two refurbishment projects are underway </p><p>after considerable OTI effort.  A funding level of $50,000 </p><p>was provided through the south-central CPA discretionary </p><p>funding mechanism.  These projects are a good example of </p><p>U.S. Government interagency cooperation to rebuild essential </p><p>governance and civic community infrastructure.  Other OTI </p><p>projects expected to be initiated in Al Hillah include: </p><p>support to the women\'s association; an orphanage project; </p><p>Internet connectivity at the Babylon University graduate </p><p>school; a city street lighting project; environment and city </p><p>clean up projects; repair of the telephone exchange; school </p><p>and medical facility rehabilitation; and support to an </p><p>independent newspaper, the local television station, and a </p><p>radio station. </p><p> </p><p>20.  DART Team West developed an excellent working </p><p>relationship with south central CPA, and was considered a </p><p>full team participant.  This is also true of the various </p><p>Coalition Civil Affairs personnel, and DART Team West\'s </p><p>automatic inclusion in the Civil Affairs units as </p><p>colleagues, working toward the same common goal.  Not enough </p><p>can be said for the support and cooperation received and </p><p>reciprocated in Al Hillah to make all U.S. Government work </p><p>much easier. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Major Sector Updates </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  Health: With some exceptions, most hospitals assessed </p><p>in DART Team West\'s AOR are functioning at pre-conflict </p><p>levels, albeit not at optimal standards.  Some governorate\'s </p><p>have received drugs and supplies from the Ministry of Health </p><p>in Baghdad, while others continue to wait.  For the first </p><p>time since 1997, drugs are being issued for free.  The </p><p>Ministry of Health\'s (MOH) dreaded "self-financing" system </p><p>has largely ended.  As a result, some health facilities have </p><p>seen a doubling in the number of patients being treated. </p><p> </p><p>22.  Through its cooperative agreement partners, DART Team </p><p>West has delivered emergency health kits to six of the seven </p><p>governorates in its AOR, and the NGO partners have begun </p><p>health activities in Wasit, Karbala, An Najaf, and Al Anbar </p><p>governorates.  Many governorates are holding first-ever </p><p>elections for MOH positions from technical department heads </p><p>to governorate-level general directors.  Babil governorate </p><p>health professionals recently voted out of office its acting </p><p>general director, a former Ba\'athist party member. </p><p> </p><p>23.  Concern remains for health facilities in rural areas. </p><p>DART Team West visited two rural, primary health centers </p><p>(PHC) and found a dearth of drugs, spartan conditions, and </p><p>abnormally high malnutrition rates among residents.  The </p><p>Coalition Civil Affairs officer for health issues in An </p><p>Najaf, recently traveled to several rural PHCs and "sub- </p><p>clinics" and said conditions ranged from inadequate to </p><p>abysmal.  "The farther we go out, the worse they get," he </p><p>said.  DART Team South and its implementing partners must </p><p>consider further assessments and interventions in these </p><p>areas, particularly among pockets of displaced populations. </p><p> </p><p>24.  Water and Sanitation:  Water supply in the south </p><p>central region appears to be mostly at pre-conflict levels, </p><p>although years of neglect has significantly reduced the </p><p>capacity and quality of water treatment systems and plants, </p><p>both in the urban and rural areas.  Conflict-affected </p><p>electrical systems limited the supply of water in many urban </p><p>areas, though water supply problems abated with recent </p><p>improvements in electrical output.  Chronic procurement and </p><p>funding challenges prior to the recent conflict proved to be </p><p>a major contributor to significant numbers of childhood </p><p>diarrhea cases.  Each hospital representative who DART Team </p><p>West interviewed reported that diarrhea was the number one </p><p>childhood health problem.  Some health facility </p><p>professionals stated that nearly all admitted children </p><p>suffered from some form of diarrhea, with roots abetted by </p><p>poor water and sanitation and exacerbated by malnutrition. </p><p> </p><p>25.  DART Team West\'s implementing partners are conducting </p><p>emergency water interventions in Wasit, Babil, An Najaf, and </p><p>Al Anbar, and will soon begin work in Al Qadisiyah and </p><p>Karbala governorates.  While NGOs have the capacity to carry </p><p>out relatively large-scale urban water projects, they are </p><p>perfectly suited to contribute in outlying urban and rural </p><p>areas.  With DART funds, CARE is rehabilitating the water </p><p>treatment system in Al Hillah that provides water to 750,000 </p><p>people.  When completed, the water quality will be improved </p><p>and the plant\'s overall capacity will increase from 16 to 75 </p><p>percent.  In rural areas, DART has a number of partners </p><p>active in emergency responses.  The International Rescue </p><p>Committee is rehabilitating the majority of all compact </p><p>water units in An Najaf, and Mercy Corps International is </p><p>improving water systems in villages surrounding Al Kut. </p><p>Most major city sewage systems are functional, but there are </p><p>isolated problems that need to be addressed, such as system </p><p>blockages at hospitals.  Overflowing septic systems, which </p><p>provide sewage needs for up to 70 percent of some city </p><p>populations, have caused health hazards in isolated </p><p>neighborhoods and could be addressed by NGOs in the short- </p><p>term. </p><p> </p><p>26.  Electricity: Electricity supplies have increased five- </p><p>fold in some neighborhoods of Al Hillah compared to before </p><p>the conflict, yet improved or optimal capacity has not been </p><p>reached in all areas in the south central region, and may </p><p>actually have diminished in some governorates.  Karbala and </p><p>Al Hillah will likely see reduced electrical supply by the </p><p>end of June given changes to and re-prioritization of the </p><p>regional and national electrical grid.  In some areas, </p><p>residents are receiving power in lieu of local factories. </p><p>Karbala\'s major industries are shutdown, yet residents are </p><p>getting more power than prior to the conflict.  Al Kut\'s </p><p>largest employer, the textile factory, is not operational </p><p>for lack of power. </p><p> </p><p>27.  Fuel: During its first week in Al Hillah, DART Team </p><p>West observed vehicle lines at gasoline stations of up to </p><p>one kilometer in length.  Tempers flared and security became </p><p>a major concern.  Coalition forces were dispatched at </p><p>gasoline stations to prevent further violence.  During the </p><p>last two weeks in Al Hillah, the gasoline crisis appears to </p><p>have receded.  The Coalition has paid for tankers to provide </p><p>fuel throughout the south-central region.  However, less </p><p>than half of the regional gasoline requirements are being </p><p>met.  Diesel fuel, on the other hand, is relatively </p><p>plentiful.  Since the conflict began on March 20, the </p><p>primary fuel for cooking, liquid propane gas (LPG), has been </p><p>extremely scarce throughout DART Team West\'s AOR.  The </p><p>largest propane gas supplier in the region sold 10,000 </p><p>cylinders per day before the conflict.  By mid-May, the </p><p>supplier was selling none.  The fuel pipelines from northern </p><p>and southern Iraq were not functioning, and no LPG tankers </p><p>were providing relief.  People were using kerosene as an </p><p>alternative, if it was available.  In some places, the cost </p><p>of LPG was beyond the means of many.  Others resorted to </p><p>cooking with wood, causing the partial denuding of urban </p><p>tree coverage in some cities and towns.  During the last two </p><p>weeks, the Coalition has funded the provision of LPG </p><p>deliveries, offering some immediate relief, but not </p><p>alleviating the serious shortage in the south-central </p><p>region. </p><p> </p><p>28.  Education: Most schools have been open for more than </p><p>one month, and nearly all students and teachers have </p><p>returned.  However, for security reasons, many schools are </p><p>holding abbreviated sessions and conclude early in the </p><p>afternoon.  Some teachers have left the classroom or are </p><p>working additional jobs to survive because of the small </p><p>amount paid in salaries.  In most governorates, April </p><p>salaries have been paid to all government workers, and a USD </p><p>20 emergency payment has been made.  A significant number of </p><p>May salaries have been paid by the Coalition, or are </p><p>expected to be paid by mid-June. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>29.  The number one problem reported to DART Team West at </p><p>every assessment has been insecurity.  Prior to the </p><p>conflict, crime was minimal even in Baghdad.  Following the </p><p>conflict, there was looting in every governorate in the DART </p><p>Team West\'s AOR.  Hospitals, warehouses, private businesses, </p><p>vehicles, orphanages, electric transmission lines, and </p><p>nearly everything of any value were susceptible to theft. </p><p>At the time of DART Team West\'s entry into Iraq on 26 April, </p><p>schools were closed, emergency services were limited at </p><p>health facilities, and businesses opened with restricted </p><p>hours and wary eyes.  Since the end of April, the team </p><p>observed a significant increase in trained police officers </p><p>on patrol and guarding essential facilities.  As of 7 June </p><p>in Al Hillah, Coalition forces had trained and armed 584 </p><p>local Iraqi police officers in four-day police academies. </p><p>Although more police training is ongoing, the Iraq people\'s </p><p>fear of insecurity appears to be waning, though they are </p><p>still not completely comfortable with current security </p><p>conditions. </p><p> </p><p>30.  UXOs and mines continue to be problematic, although </p><p>some awareness programs are underway.  UXO and mine- </p><p>awareness posters are visible in public areas, NGOs, </p><p>Coalition forces, the United Nations, and other agencies are </p><p>beginning education activities.  The El Hideria health </p><p>clinic, 40 kilometers north of An Najaf, has received more </p><p>than 30 patients injured by UXOs since the end of the </p><p>conflict, including three who sustained injuries last week. </p><p>By early May, Ar Rutbah in Al Anbar governorate also had 30 </p><p>victims of injuries sustained by UXO accidents. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>The Need for Coordination </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>31.  All organizations and groups conducting humanitarian </p><p>and development activities in the western and south central </p><p>regions of Iraq need to begin exchanging information and </p><p>providing mutual support.  Of vital importance is also to </p><p>include Iraqi departmental heads in all planning dialogues. </p><p>Iraqi participation in planning will help empower local </p><p>officials, increase their levels of responsibility, and most </p><p>likely provide the best sources of information.  DART Team </p><p>West has observed very limited involvement of local </p><p>officials in the humanitarian decision-making process.  DART </p><p>Baghdad, DART Team South, and DART Team North must encourage </p><p>more local involvement whenever and wherever possible. </p><p> </p><p>32.  In the early stages of DART Team West\'s assessments </p><p>within Iraq, nearly all humanitarian responses were being </p><p>conducted by Coalition Civil Affairs units.  They are still </p><p>doing the majority of the humanitarian work on the ground, </p><p>with relatively little funding.  A growing number of NGOs </p><p>and international relief organizations have opened offices </p><p>or begun field assessments in south-central Iraq, including </p><p>various U.N. agencies.  The World Food Program (WFP) has </p><p>been the only exception.  WFP\'s Iraqi staff has been </p><p>operating effectively for weeks.  USAID and CPA contractors </p><p>based in Al Hillah, including Bechtel and the Research </p><p>Triangle Institute, are visiting and assessing all south- </p><p>central governorates and are planning response initiatives. </p><p>To avoid redundancy, and for planning purposes, there must </p><p>be more interaction and information sharing among all </p><p>parties involved in the restoration of Iraq.  The DARTs can </p><p>help facilitate this coordination. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Waiting and Hoping </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>33.  When DART Team West\'s translator was asked to provide </p><p>his viewpoint on the condition of Iraq, he responded by </p><p>stating that conditions were improving in Iraq, yet people </p><p>were waiting for more livelihood improvements and were </p><p>apprehensive about the future.  He is content with the </p><p>changes the Coalition forces have brought to the residents </p><p>of Al Hillah and the surrounding governorates.  "My family, </p><p>my friends, we feel it is better," he said.  "You liberated </p><p>us from Saddam Hussein.  This is a better thing."  He </p><p>continued, "If there is a central, democratic government, I </p><p>hope it\'ll be okay.  (With) our oil, our wealth, our land, I </p><p>think it\'ll be fine."  But, there is a long way to go. </p><p>"Believe me there are some problems." </p><p> </p><p>34.  The DART Team West translator said people accept the </p><p>Coalition forces, for now.  "The Shia don\'t hate the </p><p>Coalition forces," he said, "because you\'re the people who </p><p>rid us of Saddam Hussein.  But we\'re waiting for you to do </p><p>your promises.  We\'re waiting for you to help us rebuild </p><p>Iraq, and have elections, and then leave.  Some people are </p><p>afraid they will never leave us.  People here are very poor </p><p>people.  If you don\'t hurt them, they will never hurt you. </p><p>If you help them, they will help you."  Before accepting the </p><p>translator position with the DART, he asked his local cleric </p><p>if it was acceptable to work with the Coalition forces.  "If </p><p>they\'re working for the Iraqi people," the cleric said, "you </p><p>can work for them."  However, the DART translator added, </p><p>there was some suspicion among Iraqis of Coalition motives. </p><p>"We don\'t know what (is) hidden in your mind," he said. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
