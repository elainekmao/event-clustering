<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 COLOMBO 001750 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR AMBASSADOR TAYLOR IN S/CT FROM CHARGE AMSELEM; ALSO </p><p>PASS SA/INS DIRECTOR GOOD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  09/17/12 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, ECON, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  Scenesetter for your upcoming visit to </p><p>Sri Lanka </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Charge d\'Affaires. </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) I want to extend a warm welcome to you on your </p><p>September 28-30 visit to Sri Lanka.  Your visit comes at </p><p>an exciting time.  A ceasefire has been in place since </p><p>December 2001, and the government and the Tamil Tigers </p><p>just sat down for constructive face-to-face talks, which </p><p>are due to continue later this year.  The situation </p><p>remains fluid, however, with the intentions of the </p><p>Tigers -- a FTO-listed organization -- still unclear. </p><p>The peace process could also be undermined by domestic </p><p>fissures, such as "cohabitation" stresses between the PM </p><p>and the President, and tensions between the Muslim </p><p>community and the LTTE.  The government is also dealing </p><p>with a delicate economic situation. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) This period of tremendous opportunity and </p><p>volatility in Sri Lanka is also a time of significant </p><p>U.S. influence.  Prime Minister Wickremesinghe wants to </p><p>work closely with the U.S.  Your visit will help cement </p><p>the gains made in U.S.-Sri Lankan relations by </p><p>underscoring our strong support for the peace process, </p><p>and by providing a forum to brief the GSL on the global </p><p>campaign against terrorism.  In addition, your visit </p><p>provides an opportunity to underscore our continuing </p><p>commitment to assisting the government in </p><p>counterterrorism training.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Status of the Peace Process </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The election of a new government in </p><p>December 2001 heralded in an exciting -- and potentially </p><p>momentous -- period in Sri Lanka.  The United National </p><p>Front (UNF) government headed by Prime Minister Ranil </p><p>Wickremasinghe has taken an activist posture, </p><p>particularly regarding the peace process.  In short </p><p>order, the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil </p><p>Eelam (LTTE) re-initiated the stalled Norwegian </p><p>government facilitation effort and put unilateral </p><p>ceasefires into effect in December 2001.  The government </p><p>also took rapid steps to ease tensions by lifting </p><p>roadblocks and checkpoints, and ending bans on medicine </p><p>and other items entering LTTE-controlled territories. </p><p>The government\'s performance on human rights issues has </p><p>also been a strong one, with many fewer Tamils </p><p>complaining of mistreatment at the hands of the security </p><p>forces.  (Note:  There is still an appearance of </p><p>impunity in some cases that the GSL needs to do more to </p><p>grapple with, however.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Continuing the positive trend, the GSL and the </p><p>LTTE went on to conclude a formal ceasefire accord in </p><p>February.  The accord is being monitored by the </p><p>Norwegian-run Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), which </p><p>has performed capably, but is thin on the ground.  In a </p><p>benchmark event, the two sides met face-to-face in </p><p>Thailand, September 16-18.  Before the talks took place, </p><p>the GSL met the longtime demand of the LTTE and lifted </p><p>its ban on the organization, effectively legalizing the </p><p>LTTE as a political entity in Sri Lanka.  The talks -- </p><p>though preliminary -- were constructive, and set the </p><p>stage for further talks slated to take place later this </p><p>year.  In a press conference held at the end of the </p><p>talks, the chief LTTE negotiator also made remarks that </p><p>seem to have edged away from an outright demand for a </p><p>separate state for Tamils. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) All of these steps have had a dramatic effect in </p><p>decreasing tensions in the country, bringing relief to a </p><p>war weary populace.  Already, the ongoing ceasefire is </p><p>the longest break that Sri Lankans have had from the </p><p>ethnic conflict since it began in 1983.  This new spirit </p><p>was symbolized by PM Wickremesinghe\'s visit to Jaffna in </p><p>March, the first such visit by a GSL leader in years. </p><p>SA Assistant Secretary Rocca joined Wickeremesinghe for </p><p>part of this visit, underscoring U.S. support for the </p><p>peace process.  A/S Rocca\'s visit also led to the </p><p>arrival of a demining team sponsored by the U.S., which </p><p>has been clearing mines in Jaffna since April.  The </p><p>Deputy Secretary also made a highly successful visit to </p><p>war-ravaged Jaffna during his August visit to Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>LTTE Intentions not clear </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Despite so much progress in so short a time, GSL </p><p>interlocutors will be the first to tell you that the </p><p>situation is potentially fluid.  One key reason for this </p><p>is lack of confidence in the LTTE (which has been listed </p><p>on our Foreign Terrorist Organization list since 1997). </p><p>While it is clear that the LTTE is worried about further </p><p>international isolation in the aftermath of September 11 </p><p>(there are indications that intensified international </p><p>pressure has decreased its funding, for example), it is </p><p>not clear whether the organization is simply looking for </p><p>a hiatus to wait out the storm.  Some of the LTTE\'s </p><p>activities raise questions about its commitment to </p><p>peace, including forced recruitment for its military </p><p>(some of it of children), and the widespread extortion </p><p>of money from Tamils and Muslims.  The LTTE also remains </p><p>authoritarian in structure and has not renounced </p><p>terrorism (although there have been no reported LTTE- </p><p>sponsored terrorist attacks this year).  With full </p><p>knowledge of these risks, the GSL has made the decision </p><p>that it wants to test the LTTE to determine whether it </p><p>is for real and, so far, this policy is generating </p><p>favorable results. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Cohabitation Stresses and Muslim issue </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Another factor that could unravel the peace </p><p>process is domestic opposition in the south.  The </p><p>radical, Sinhalese chauvinist Janantha Vimukthi Peramuna </p><p>(JVP) party has engaged in rallies and demonstrations </p><p>against the ceasefire accord.  A potentially more </p><p>ominous threat is President Kumaratunga and her party, </p><p>who have sent mixed signals, at times constructive, at </p><p>times critical.  Kumaratunga\'s attitude seems largely </p><p>bound up in the cohabitation tensions that flare between </p><p>her and Prime Minister Wickremasinghe\'s government. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Another level of tension involves the Muslim </p><p>community and the LTTE.  The two sides have long been at </p><p>loggerheads, particularly in the ethnically mixed </p><p>Eastern Province.  Based on first-hand observation by </p><p>Mission personnel and other reports, some Muslims are so </p><p>angered at efforts by the LTTE to marginalize their </p><p>community that the possible growth of Islamic extremism </p><p>needs to be closely monitored.   Taken together, all of </p><p>these tensions are not positive for the peace process, </p><p>especially during this sensitive period when the </p><p>negotiation track with the LTTE is just starting up. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Economic Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Turning briefly to economic issues, Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>situation is delicate.  While it has the most open </p><p>economy in South Asia and a relatively high per capita </p><p>income (USD 837), economic growth has been uneven and is </p><p>mostly confined to the greater Colombo region.  A litany </p><p>of problems in 2001 conspired to produce the country\'s </p><p>first year of GDP contraction since independence (minus </p><p>1.4 percent).  The new UNF government appears committed </p><p>to putting the right policies in place to re-ignite </p><p>economic growth.  The main test of this commitment came </p><p>in its 2002 budget, presented in March.  This budget </p><p>contained many substantive reform measures and was key </p><p>to restarting the suspended payments of the IMF\'s </p><p>Standby Arrangement.  The government is now implementing </p><p>many of these reforms, while trying to minimize the </p><p>burden of increased prices on the population.  We expect </p><p>2002 to be a rebuilding year, with growth of 2-3 </p><p>percent. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Our trade relationship with Sri Lanka entered </p><p>a new phase with the signing of a bilateral Trade and </p><p>Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in July.  The TIFA </p><p>sets up a council, jointly chaired by USTR and the Sri </p><p>Lankan Ministry of Commerce, to discuss trade and </p><p>investment issues.  The first council meeting is to take </p><p>place in November with the visit to Sri Lanka of Deputy </p><p>USTR Ambassador Huntsman.  The U.S. intends to use the </p><p>TIFA process to improve the investment climate in Sri </p><p>Lanka and win greater business here for American firms. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Counterterrorism training </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) One area of particular interest to the GSL will </p><p>be counterterrorism training.  The U.S. has engaged Sri </p><p>Lanka quite actively in this key area.  In addition to </p><p>military-to-military training, the ATA and INL programs </p><p>in Sri Lanka continue very successfully.  In FY-02, the </p><p>ATA program conducted five courses and spent </p><p>approximately USD 1.2 million to equip 80 police and </p><p>government of Sri Lanka officials with various anti- </p><p>terrorist skills.  In addition, INL, in conjunction with </p><p>the Department of Justice trained an additional 50 </p><p>criminal justice sector officials in investigation and </p><p>prosecution. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The government of Sri Lanka has responded </p><p>positively to the training.  Unlike some countries, Sri </p><p>Lanka takes pride in incorporating the training material </p><p>and pedagogy into its budding police training </p><p>curriculum.  But much work remains to be done -- and Sri </p><p>Lankans know it.  On the heels of the most recent ATA </p><p>counterterrorism legislation seminar, Sri Lanka has </p><p>identified areas where it needs further assistance. </p><p>From material assistance with creation of a national </p><p>criminal database to assistance with financial crimes </p><p>investigation skills, Sri Lanka awaits much needed -- </p><p>and appreciated -- ATA training.  As Ambassador Wills </p><p>noted in a recent message to you, we believe that Sri </p><p>Lanka should remain a priority country for such </p><p>training. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) This exciting period in Sri Lanka provides many </p><p>opportunities for the U.S.  Per the recent policy </p><p>review, USG agencies are in the process of visiting Sri </p><p>Lanka to assess possible enhanced defense </p><p>cooperation, review economic and commercial issues, and </p><p>study the possible return of the Peace Corps.  As he </p><p>made clear to President Bush during their meeting in </p><p>Washington in July and to the Deputy Secretary in </p><p>Colombo in August, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe wants </p><p>to work closely with the U.S.  Your visit will further </p><p>help cement U.S.-Sri Lankan relations by underscoring </p><p>our strong support for the peace process and by </p><p>providing a forum to brief the GSL on the global </p><p>campaign against terrorism.  In addition, your visit </p><p>provides an opportunity to underscore our continuing </p><p>commitment to assisting the government in </p><p>counterterrorism training. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) We suggest that you make the following key </p><p>points in your meetings with Sri Lankan officials: </p><p> </p><p>-- Express strong U.S. support for the peace process and </p><p>Norwegian facilitation.  GSL needs to keep up momentum; </p><p>Sri Lanka is a vital symbol of movement toward peace and </p><p>stability in a troubled South Asian region. </p><p> </p><p>-- All parties should work in national interest on peace </p><p>process and on economic reform.  It is important that </p><p>peace process not falter because of political </p><p>infighting. </p><p> </p><p>-- Express appreciation to Sri Lanka for its support of </p><p>the global campaign against terrorism.  Review with GSL </p><p>interlocutors the status of the global campaign. </p><p> </p><p>-- Review opportunities for additional U.S.-sponsored </p><p>counterterrorism training. </p><p>-- Human rights issues important; GSL has shown </p><p>significant improvement; need to work to end appearance </p><p>of impunity. </p><p>AMSELEM </p><p></p></div>
