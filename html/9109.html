<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 AMMAN 003991 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR NOVELLI/SAUMS </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>USDOC 4520/ITA/MAC/ONE/PTHANOS </p><p>PASS OPIC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EINV, JO, XF </p><p>SUBJECT: Secretary Powell/Trade Rep Zoellick Discuss </p><p>Middle East Free Trade Initiative with Arab Ministers </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Introduction and Summary </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) King Abdullah convened a breakfast meeting June </p><p>23 with Secretary Powell and Trade Representative </p><p>Zoellick at the World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in </p><p>Jordan to discuss the President\'s Middle East free trade </p><p>initiative with the heads of Arab delegations to the WEF. </p><p>Participating Arab ministers responded enthusiastically </p><p>to presentations by Secretary Powell and USTR Zoellick on </p><p>the President\'s free-trade vision and the steps required </p><p>to realize it.  They noted the linkages between trade, </p><p>economic and social development, and regional peace and </p><p>security.  They also made constructive points about the </p><p>practicalities of implementing the ambitious agenda and </p><p>the opportunity offered by free trade between the region </p><p>and the United States.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>King Abdullah Welcomes U.S. Initiative </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The King opened the discussion by welcoming the </p><p>trade initiative for the Middle East that the President </p><p>announced in his University of South Carolina speech.  He </p><p>described how Jordan\'s economy had benefited from opening </p><p>to international trade and investment, including the Free </p><p>Trade Agreement and Bilateral Investment Treaty it </p><p>concluded with the United States.  Annual trade between </p><p>the U.S. and Jordan increased from under $20 million to </p><p>over $500 million in five years.  Over 30,000 new jobs </p><p>were created and over $100 million in new Foreign Direct </p><p>Investment (FDI) was attracted to the country.  At the </p><p>same time, the King warned that opening an economy was </p><p>hard work: Jordan enacted new laws protecting </p><p>intellectual property, the environment and labor rights, </p><p>and had reformed its investment and trade laws and </p><p>regulations. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Secretary: Trade Part of the President\'s Vision for Region </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Secretary Powell described how the President\'s </p><p>goal of a free trade area in the Middle East within ten </p><p>years fits with  our vision for engaging with the region. </p><p>Building peace means creating economic security and </p><p>opportunity for the large number of young people entering </p><p>the region\'s workforce.  As countries drop trade </p><p>barriers, the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) </p><p>would help countries invest in their future through </p><p>programs supporting education, political reform and </p><p>empowering women.  The Secretary said that it was </p><p>important that countries act now, and pointed to Jordan </p><p>as an example of the great potential of trade to generate </p><p>income and jobs when a country takes the initiative to </p><p>change.  The President, the Secretary affirmed, is </p><p>totally committed to this vision for the region. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Zoellick:  A Step by Step Process to Regional Free Trade </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Foreshadowing the speech to the WEF plenary </p><p>assembly he would deliver later that morning, USTR </p><p>Zoellick took the floor to describe how the United States </p><p>foresaw realizing the President\'s regional trade vision. </p><p>He said that the United States needed first to listen and </p><p>learn from its partners in the region.  Since different </p><p>countries were at different stages in opening to </p><p>international trade, it would be necessary to customize </p><p>our interaction to their individual needs.  Thus, </p><p>Ambassador Zoellick foresaw the following order of </p><p>actions. </p><p> </p><p>  1) Working to bring countries not currently members of </p><p>     the WTO into that organization. </p><p> </p><p>  2) Expanding the region\'s use of Generalized System of </p><p>     Preferences (GSP) benefits.  (The Ambassador </p><p>     compared the $300 million the region currently </p><p>     exports to the U.S. under GSP with the $2 billion </p><p>     per year exported by Brazil under the program.) </p><p>  3) Negotiating Trade and Investment Framework </p><p>     Agreements (TIFAs) with countries that do not </p><p>     Currently have such agreements with the United </p><p>     States. </p><p> </p><p>  4) Concluding Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) with </p><p>     countries that do not yet have them. </p><p> </p><p>  5) Building a comprehensive FTA relationship with and </p><p>     among the countries of the region and the United </p><p>     States. </p><p> </p><p>In this process, countries like Jordan, Morocco, and </p><p>Bahrain -- which either already have or will be </p><p>negotiating and concluding FTAs with the United States -- </p><p>will serve as models and sub-regional hubs for building a </p><p>regional system. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) This process would, the Ambassador said, </p><p>encourage not only greater trade between the United </p><p>States and the region, but greater trade within the </p><p>region as well.  Cumulation of origin among countries </p><p>that are working toward FTA\'s with countries that already </p><p>have FTA\'s would be an important way to encourage intra- </p><p>regional trade.  Countries with cumulation might then be </p><p>drawn together into regional arrangements.  At the same </p><p>time, the United States would provide assistance, </p><p>particularly through the MEPI program, to help countries </p><p>develop their capacities to negotiate and implement free </p><p>trade agreements and to develop their economies and </p><p>societies to be ready to take greater advantage of a </p><p>stronger relationship with the international trading </p><p>system.  For example, U.S. assistance could help </p><p>countries develop stronger institutions to oversee </p><p>investment. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Arab Ministers Welcoming and Constructive </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Ministers from Arab countries attending the </p><p>breakfast joined King Abdullah in welcoming the </p><p>President\'s initiative and appreciated the presentations </p><p>of Secretary Powell and Ambassador Zoellick.  They also </p><p>made the following specific points: </p><p> </p><p>-- Palestinian Trade Minister Maher Masri said that there </p><p>had been an implicit agreement at the Camp David talks </p><p>that the PNA should become an observer in the WTO.  He </p><p>hoped that this would occur and appreciated the technical </p><p>and political support of breakfast participants to that </p><p>end.  Ambassador Zoellick called this an "excellent idea" </p><p>on which he hoped to work closely with Secretary Powell. </p><p>He noted the U.S. support provided through USAID to </p><p>reform Palestinian commercial law and promote small </p><p>business. </p><p> </p><p>-- Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassem of Qatar proposed a </p><p>committee be formed to meet on a regular basis to work </p><p>out how to solve issues in countries and regions and keep </p><p>up the momentum of the initiative.  Noting a hundred-fold </p><p>increase in U.S.-Qatari investment, he added that Qatar </p><p>was in the process of creating an investment authority. </p><p> </p><p>-- Observing that different counties were at different </p><p>stages in their discussions of FTAs with the U.S., </p><p>Egypt\'s Foreign Minister Muhammad Maher asked if the </p><p>President\'s idea was to have a set of bilateral </p><p>agreements that would eventually be bound up in a </p><p>regional agreement, or for the two processes to proceed </p><p>in parallel.  Ambassador Zoellick replied it was most </p><p>likely that bilateral agreements would be connected over </p><p>time, perhaps initially on a sub-regional level. </p><p>Referring to a recent move by the Egyptian foreign </p><p>ministry to overrule the trade ministry on a key trade </p><p>decision, Zoellick also said it was critical that </p><p>countries be completely committed to the process of </p><p>economic opening.  The initiative and momentum had to </p><p>come from the countries within the region, he said. </p><p> </p><p>-- Finance and National Economy Minister Saif of Bahrain </p><p>especially welcomed U.S. assistance on capacity building </p><p>and technical assistance to help increase trade flows. </p><p>He hoped agencies like the U.S. Export Import Bank and </p><p>OPIC would expand their activities in the region.  He </p><p>also suggested "offset" agreements were potentially </p><p>useful tools to encourage investment in the region. </p><p> </p><p>-- Omani Foreign Minister Yusef bin Alawi said Oman was </p><p>interested in "joining hands" with the United States, </p><p>potentially through a TIFA, but hoped the United States\' </p><p>commitment over time would match its words now. </p><p>Ambassador Zoellick said the President\'s effort to obtain </p><p>Trade Promotion Authority and extension of preferential </p><p>arrangements including GSP showed his commitment to free </p><p>trade.  Jordan had shown it was possible move quickly in </p><p>trade negotiations.  Waiting for legislation like the </p><p>Baucus/McCain proposals (which would legislatively create </p><p>new regional trade preferences) could take a long time, </p><p>Zoellick said. </p><p> </p><p>-- Foreign Cooperation Minister al-Fasi said Morocco had </p><p>been very pleased that in its FTA negotiations the United </p><p>States had been willing to take into account Morocco\'s </p><p>level of development and the sensitivity of certain </p><p>sectors, particularly agriculture.  He hoped programs </p><p>like the Millennium Challenge Account and MEPI would help </p><p>Morocco and other countries get through the difficult </p><p>period of social and economic transition to free trade. </p><p>Ambassador Zoellick agreed the key to success was </p><p>creating jobs, and noted the increased interest U.S. </p><p>companies were showing in investing in Morocco since the </p><p>start of FTA negotiations. </p><p> </p><p>-- Arab League Secretary General Amer Moussa said the </p><p>President\'s initiative was highly commendable and called </p><p>on Arab countries to engage.  He thought the Arab League </p><p>could play a role in helping members share experiences </p><p>and prepare for negotiations.  He added that he thought </p><p>regional negotiations with the U.S. would need to be </p><p>coordinated with parallel trade negotiations with the </p><p>European Union.  Finally, he hoped that these processes </p><p>would give "a shot in the arm" to the Arab League\'s </p><p>effort to negotiate a regional free trade agreement by </p><p>2005 (see 02 Amman 5212). </p><p> </p><p>-- Mohamed Jouini, Tunisia\'s Development and </p><p>International Cooperation Minister, pointed to Tunisia\'s </p><p>positive experience in opening its economy, having been </p><p>the first in the region to negotiate an EU Partnership </p><p>Agreement.  He highlighted the connection between trade </p><p>and investment and noted the importance of investing in </p><p>human resources, especially to take advantage of high </p><p>value-added opportunities. </p><p> </p><p>-- Taking the floor for the PNA, Foreign Minister Nabil </p><p>Sha\'ath called on Secretary Powell to make trade the </p><p>"first priority" in the Road Map to peace through </p><p>relaxations of controls on movements of Palestinians. </p><p> </p><p>-- Finally, Jordan\'s Trade Minister Salah al-Bashir </p><p>suggested that to keep up the momentum of this meeting, </p><p>ministers agree to meet again with U.S. representatives </p><p>to discuss ways to move forward. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Conclusion and Comment </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) In a press conference with Secretary Powell, </p><p>Ambassador Zoellick, and Trade Minister al-Bashir </p><p>immediately following the breakfast, Jordanian Foreign </p><p>Minister Marwan Muasher read an agreed statement that </p><p>expressed the hope that the dialogue begun over breakfast </p><p>would continue.  Participating Arab ministers seemed both </p><p>enthusiastic about the U.S. initiative and sober-minded </p><p>about the challenges such an effort would entail.  A </p><p>recurring theme of the breakfast was also the mutually </p><p>supportive relationships between the Free Trade </p><p>Initiative, MEPI and the efforts to establish broad peace </p><p>and security in the region. </p><p> </p><p>8.
