<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 000945 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR P, EUR, EUR/SE, NEA AND NEA/NGA; </p><p>NSC FOR RICE AND HADLEY; OSD FOR DEPSECDEF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, TU, IZ, Iraq </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKISH MFA U/S ZIYAL AND AMBASSADOR PEARSON </p><p>DISCUSS MILITARY AND POLITICAL MOU\'S </p><p> </p><p> (U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Ambassador met with MFA U/S Ugur Ziyal mid-afternoon </p><p>February 6 to press on several issues.  First, he got from </p><p>Ziyal a commitment to have the MFA, Treasury and other </p><p>concerned agencies available during the holiday next week </p><p>from Wednesday on to close on any outstanding questions. </p><p>Ziyal said he had given instructions to the MFA to have </p><p>critical, i.e., Iraq- related, offices staffed, and he knew </p><p>Treasury would also be available. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Secondly, Ambassador explained why a "political MOU" </p><p>was unacceptable, pointing out interalia the dangers to </p><p>Turkey if such a document were misinterpreted as a U.S.- </p><p>Turkey political blueprint for Iraq and the region.  He said </p><p>he understood, but that Turkey "is in a difficult spot."  "We </p><p>have to have," he said, a document that the "PM can use to </p><p>convince the Parliament that the political concerns of Turkey </p><p>have been met, and the U.S. and Turkey are in agreement."  He </p><p>asked for suggestions, and Ambassador told him to think in </p><p>terms of a statement.  He asked if "Statement of Political </p><p>Principles" might work?  (Note: Amb Khalilzad is currently </p><p>meeting with his Turkish counterpart on the substance of the </p><p>U.S. instructed paper, and we will have a fuller report to </p><p>forward from that meeting. End Note). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) On the third issue, Ambassador said the mil-to-mil MOU </p><p>negotiations needed closing instructions from the MFA </p><p>leadership.  In those talks, we now were trying to resolve </p><p>taxation, claims and criminal jurisdiction questions, </p><p>Ambassador said.  He explained that we were offering creative </p><p>solutions for taxation and claims questions, but that the </p><p>criminal jurisdiction issue is fundamental for the U.S. side. </p><p>  Ziyal said he would discuss these points with the Turkish </p><p>negotiator.  As Ambassador left Ziyal,s office, the Turkish </p><p>negotiator walked in, apparently to brief Ziyal on the </p><p>discussions.  (Note: the U.S. team, led by Ambassador Lino, </p><p>has informed the Turks that we will stay tonight as late as </p><p>possible to close on the issues.  End Note). </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
