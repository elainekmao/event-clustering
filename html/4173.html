<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 001933 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/31/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ISTANBUL\'S MARKET ANALYSTS COME TO TERMS WITH </p><p>PROSPECT OF AK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 7631 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 7681 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 7549 </p><p>     D. ISTANBUL 1923 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Consul General David Arnett.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: While much of Istanbul\'s secular </p><p>establishment remains wary and suspicious of Recep Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan\'s Justice and Development (AK) party, soundings among </p><p>market insiders in Istanbul on the eve of Sunday\'s polls show </p><p>a more nuanced view among the city\'s business elite.  In </p><p>contrast to the doom and gloom scenarios we heard earlier </p><p>this fall from market analysts who saw anything but a Kemal </p><p>Dervis-led post-election economic team as a catastrophe that </p><p>would swiftly lead to an economic meltdown, markets are </p><p>increasingly coming to terms with an AK government.  The </p><p>decline in political uncertainty will likely help the current </p><p>market rally.  But we have also heard concerns with the </p><p>economic policies of the new government, and with some of the </p><p>likely AK economic policy-makers.  We believe that following </p><p>elections, and a short honeymoon, these concerns will start </p><p>to grow.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Watchful Waiting: As ref B related, Istanbul\'s secular </p><p>establishment is resigned to the prospect of an AK victory in </p><p>Sunday\'s election, but remains deeply troubled about what it </p><p>bodes for the future of Turkey\'s secular republic. </p><p>Surprisingly, however, given their worries earlier this fall </p><p>and their tendency at that time to see former Minister of </p><p>State Kemal Dervis as the Turkish economy\'s only potential </p><p>savior, Istanbul financial circles now appear to be </p><p>increasingly at ease with the prospect of AK\'s coming to </p><p>power.  Analysts such as Global Director of Research Cem </p><p>Akyurek and Garanti Securities Executive Director David </p><p>Edgerly now indicate that an AK victory will not preclude a </p><p>short-term market rally, and can potentially even lead to a </p><p>"virtuous circle" in which interest rates decline and ease </p><p>the risk of a Turkish financing gap next year.  Testimony to </p><p>the Istanbul financial community\'s coming to terms with the </p><p>prospect of AK are the recent performance of major market </p><p>indicators: the Istanbul Stock exchange and interest rates </p><p>have all remained relatively stable, even in the face of </p><p>occasional gaffes by Erdogan and his deputies.  The market\'s </p><p>tolerant attitude has been, in the words of one banker, that </p><p>"better they make these mistakes before the election, than </p><p>after, when they might cause real trouble." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) "Market Friendly": Beyond the need to put the best </p><p>face on what appears to be inevitable, a number of factors </p><p>appear to be at play in the financial community\'s attitude </p><p>toward AK.  Many believe (as Edgerly told us) </p><p>"philosophically AK is market friendly,"  and by nature and </p><p>inclination will be supportive of the securities market </p><p>(though perhaps "less so" of debt markets).  A second factor </p><p>is the market\'s ever-present hope for stability, and desire </p><p>to avoid uncertainty, and the resultant genuine </p><p>attractiveness of the prospect of a strong one or at most </p><p>two-party government, even if it involves an untested player </p><p>like AK.  Perhaps most importantly, there is also the hope </p><p>that AK understands that its economic options are limited, </p><p>and that it has no alternative to continuing to implement the </p><p>country\'s economic reform program.  We heard this repeatedly: </p><p>from bankers, securities firms, and businessmen in the real </p><p>sector.  They argued that "AK is not stupid" and will stick </p><p>with the program, since it has no alternative, and since it </p><p>will want to show it can govern responsibly.  (Comment: Some </p><p>AK Economic officials, such as Vice Chairman Ali Coskun, do </p><p>not seem concerned that they have no alternative, per ref d.) </p><p> Dissent came only from the influential TUSIAD, where Deputy </p><p>Secretary General Umit Ismen reminded us of a board member\'s </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>admonition to "remember that we are viewing things </p><p>rationally, while politics does not always follow those </p><p>rules." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) A Weak Bench?: A more widespread concern in business </p><p>circles here is whether AK has the economic bench strength to </p><p>manage a complex economic challenge.  There is thus worry </p><p>about how sustainable any stability provided by an AK </p><p>government will be.  Global\'s Cem Akyurek told us recently </p><p>that the answers to two questions he had recently suggested </p><p>that a New York colleague ask a visiting AK delegation had </p><p>only reinforced his skepticism about the party.  When under </p><p>questioning the AK speaker indicated that he had been a REFAH </p><p>supporter and that his business experience consisted of a </p><p>brief stint in the textile industry, Akyurek\'s doubts were </p><p>confirmed.  "These are not the people who can solve Turkey\'s </p><p>problems," he argued.  There is some indication, however, </p><p>that AK\'s ability to move beyond its base and attract other </p><p>center-right wing supporters is easing this concern. </p><p>5. (C) Weak Opposition: Above all, AK is benefiting from its </p><p>opposition.  To be sure, Dervis and his Republican People\'s </p><p>Party (CHP) allies remain the market\'s preference, though </p><p>disappointment is widespread that he has not been more </p><p>effective politically.  Dervis\' recent Radikal interview, </p><p>which Ismen characterized as the "talk of the town," appears </p><p>to have done particular damage, reinforcing his "statist" </p><p>image and leaving a bad taste even among his business </p><p>backers, particularly with his claim never to have supported </p><p>the privatization of Turk Telecom.  AK has also benefited </p><p>from comparison to the other two parties that now appear to </p><p>have a chance to cross the threshold: Cem Uzan\'s Genc (Youth) </p><p>Party and Tansu Ciller\'s DYP (ref c).  In contrast to these </p><p>two parties\' populist promises and (in Ciller\'s case) </p><p>"stubborn refusal to learn from past mistakes" (by pledging </p><p>to return to a managed exchange rate), AK\'s campaign has </p><p>seemed "relatively responsible" in comparison.  Hence Dervis\' </p><p>charges that the party is using different messages for </p><p>different audiences has not resonated, as observers accept it </p><p>as part of politics, and in any case see AK\'s domestic </p><p>promises as much less dangerous than those of its rivals. </p><p>"Hurriyet" economic commentator Ege Cansen, for instance, </p><p>suggested recently in his column that Uzan is the pivotal </p><p>figure of this election, and that his most nefarious effect </p><p>has been to cause Ciller to adopt a similarly "pandering" </p><p>message.  Amplifying on these comments at a recent dinner for </p><p>visiting Johns Hopkins professor Francis Fukuyama, he saw a </p><p>particular danger in these "negative political influences" </p><p>and the possibility they might impel Erdogan to adopt similar </p><p>policies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Comment: Beyond making a virtue of necessity, </p><p>financial markets will likely be cautiously optimistic </p><p>following elections, on the back of declining political </p><p>uncertainty.  But at some point in the government formation </p><p>process, the concerns we are already hearing about likely GOT </p><p>policies (and about some of the likely AK policymakers) could </p><p>start to grow quickly.  End Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
