An alliance of the Canadian federal government, </p><p>Ontario provincial government, automotive sector </p><p>manufacturers and labor unions are working to define </p><p>and implement a long-term strategy to keep the Canadian </p><p>automotive sector competitive (Ref B).  At least one </p><p>element of the multi-prong strategy, the elimination of </p><p>the federal and provincial capital tax, has already </p><p>been embarked upon.  Implementation of the new strategy </p><p>is expected to be a multi-year process with no firm </p><p>timeline.  It is, however, very clear from statements </p><p>given by both the manufacturing sector and government </p><p>that all elements of the nascent auto strategy will </p><p>scrupulously comply with WTO and NAFTA ground rules. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>Scale of Automotive Industry in Canada </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. The importance of the automotive industry to the </p><p>Canadian economy cannot be overstated.  It is a major </p><p>contributor to the Canadian economy, creating more than </p><p>550,000 jobs, and generates approximately 12 per cent </p><p>of the manufacturing sector\'s contribution to Canada\'s </p><p>Gross Domestic Product.  The automotive sector also has </p><p>seen the highest capital investment of all </p><p>manufacturing industries.  Between 1991 and 2001, </p><p>capital investment averaged C$2.9 billion per year. </p><p>The Canadian automotive industry is fully integrated </p><p>into the North American market.  In 2001, the </p><p>automotive industry produced C$95 billion worth of </p><p>motor vehicles - 90 per cent of which were exported, </p><p>primarily to the United States. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>New Policy to strengthen automotive industry </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. The maintenance of this vital industrial sector is </p><p>important to the federal government and to the Ontario </p><p>provincial government, where most of the manufacturing </p><p>capacity is located.  It is, however, a collection of </p><p>government, labor, and corporate interests that </p><p>comprises the Canadian Automotive Partnership Council </p><p>(CAPC) that is in the process of developing a long-term </p><p>strategic vision for the industry to ensure its growth </p><p>and vitality.  Its membership includes the presidents </p><p>of Canada\'s automotive assembly companies; senior </p><p>executives from the parts, aftermarket, dealership and </p><p>academic sectors; the president of the Canadian Auto </p><p>Workers Union (Buzz Hargrove); and ministers of </p><p>industry and/or economic development for the federal, </p><p>Ontario and Quebec governments.  The Council is co- </p><p>chaired by Michael Grimaldi, President of General </p><p>Motors of Canada, and Don Walker, President of Intier </p><p>Automotive, one of Canada\'s most significant automotive </p><p>components manufacturers. </p><p> </p><p>4. CAPC members met in Toronto in mid-December 2002 and </p><p>reviewed a series of papers drafted by working groups </p><p>that address five key dimensions of the nascent </p><p>strategy: human resources; innovation; trade </p><p>infrastructure; fiscal and investment measures; and </p><p>regulatory harmonization.  These draft papers, and more </p><p>about CAPC are available at the following URL: </p><p> </p><p>http://www.strategis.ic.gc.ca/SSG/am01451e.ht ml </p><p> </p><p>5. The key questions raised in Ref A focus on fiscal </p><p>and investment measures, the relevant CAPC proposals in </p><p>this domain are outlined below. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>CAPC Fiscal & Investment Recommendations </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  The CAPC Fiscal and Investment Policy Work Group </p><p>recommends that the federal and provincial governments: </p><p> </p><p>-- Eliminate the federal Large Corporations Tax (a.k.a. </p><p>the Capital Tax) and provincial capital taxes to remove </p><p>a key impediment (see paragraph 9). </p><p> </p><p>-- Establish an Investment Tax Credit to encourage </p><p>investment in new manufacturing machinery and </p><p>equipment. </p><p> </p><p>-- Continue and expand the Manufacturing & Processing </p><p>(M&P) deduction (a 7% deduction exclusive to M&P </p><p>profits which the GoC is considering abolishing) to </p><p>reduce the effective federal and provincial rates to </p><p>gain a competitive tax advantage in NAFTA. </p><p> </p><p>7. The CAPC group makes clear that any effort to </p><p>provide an investment incentive must be transparent, </p><p>available to all on equal footing (unlike the exclusive </p><p>"Autopact" arrangements) and consistent with WTO and </p><p>NAFTA rules. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>What is the timetable for implementation? </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. On the question of a timetable, the message we </p><p>received from Guy Leclaire, Director of Automotive </p><p>Policy at the Department of Industry (Industry Canada) </p><p>is that the Canadian Automotive Strategy is a work in </p><p>progress and that there is no firm timetable for </p><p>implementation. </p><p> </p><p>9. Nevertheless, one major element has been embarked </p><p>upon.  The elimination of the federal capital tax </p><p>proposed in the federal budget of February 18, 2003 </p><p>implements a principal recommendation of the CAPC. </p><p> </p><p>10. Both the federal and provincial governments in </p><p>Canada levy taxes on the capital of corporations. </p><p>Unlike income taxes, which are paid when a corporation </p><p>has taxable income, capital taxes must be paid </p><p>regardless of whether a corporation is profitable.  The </p><p>federal capital tax is levied on all corporations with </p><p>more than $10 million of capital used in Canada; it is </p><p>reduced by the income surtax paid by the corporation </p><p>(Ref D). </p><p> </p><p>11. The February 2003 federal budget proposed to </p><p>eliminate the federal capital tax, as follows: - First, </p><p>the capital threshold at which the tax applies will be </p><p>raised, from $10 million to $50 million effective 2004. </p><p>As of 2004 medium-sized businesses under the $50- </p><p>million threshold will no longer have to pay the tax. </p><p>Second, the rate of the tax will be reduced in stages </p><p>over a period of five years so that by 2008, the tax </p><p>will be completely eliminated. </p><p> </p><p>12. At the provincial level, Ontario\'s 2003 budget </p><p>(delivered in late March) also promised to eliminate </p><p>the capital tax, though a 10% cut in 2004 and complete </p><p>phasing out by 2008, in line with the federal </p><p>government\'s plans (ref C).  Ontario\'s decision to </p><p>start phasing out capital taxes follows similar </p><p>decisions in Alberta and the three Territories, where </p><p>capital taxes already have been eliminated, as well as </p><p>in British Columbia and Quebec, where concrete cuts </p><p>have been announced in recent budgets (Ref D). </p><p> </p><p>13. According to the GoC the elimination of the capital </p><p>tax over five years will be fully legislated in order </p><p>to provide businesses and investors with the certainty </p><p>needed to factor the tax reduction into their business </p><p>decisions.  The GoC budget documents also allege that </p><p>when the federal capital tax is eliminated in 2008, the </p><p>average combined federal and provincial corporate tax </p><p>rate in Canada will be 6.6 percentage points lower than </p><p>in the U.S </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14. Leclaire emphasized that the Auto Strategy is </p><p>intended to be more than simply a wish list for </p><p>handouts from the government to industry.  Rather, </p><p>Leclaire expects it will be an effort largely to match, </p><p>or refine, existing government efforts (provincial and </p><p>federal) with industry requirements.  For example, </p><p>suggestions include eliminating regulatory impediments </p><p>to investment (such as different manufacturing </p><p>standards in USA and Canada); targeting more R&D funds </p><p>to the automotive sector and making more auto R&D </p><p>eligible for R&D tax credits; and providing more </p><p>targeted investment in technical education to provide </p><p>the workforce of the future. </p><p> </p><p>15. Most significantly, there is no proposal for a </p><p>local content requirement in any of the elements of the </p><p>CAPC proposals.  The musings of CAW chief Buzz Hargrove </p><p>(Refs A,B) in this respect are not indicative of the </p><p>eventual GoC policy direction, nor industry intentions. </p><p>And although the CAPC does recommend an Investment Tax </p><p>Credit to entice investment in physical plant, it </p><p>remains simply a recommendation whose form is not </p><p>elaborated and one that has not yet been seized upon by </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>16. The clear message we have received from GoC </p><p>interlocutors, one which is reiterated by CAPC, is that </p><p>whatever the eventual size and shape of the Canadian </p><p>Auto Strategy it will comply scrupulously with WTO and </p><p>NAFTA strictures. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
