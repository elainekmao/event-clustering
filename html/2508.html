<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000521 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, US, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: 9-11 DISASTER SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p>1. Post recently received the letter at para 3 (which </p><p>included a donation of 15,000 Naira, or USD140), which is </p><p>indicative of the messages of solidarity we have received </p><p>from ordinary Nigerians in support of the families affected </p><p>by 9-11.  We thought it important to inform the Department </p><p>how ordinary Nigerians have responded to the attacks on the </p><p>United States. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  On February 7, CG Lagos hosted a dinner for Nigerian </p><p>donors to victims of 9/11; most, but not all donations came </p><p>from Southern Nigerians.  The two largest donations of N1 </p><p>million (USD 8,770) each were received from a Pharmaceutical </p><p>firm and a Managing Director of a bank.  Many other donations </p><p>came from ordinary Nigerians. While the size of many of these </p><p>donations would be considered small by American standards, </p><p>for most Nigerians, they represent a significant gesture </p><p>(annual per capita GDP is N31,426 or USD285).  Perhaps our </p><p>most generous donor was 10-year old Dumebi Browne, who </p><p>explained to a rapt audience at the CG dinner that he had </p><p>donated N 1,000 to the 9/11 fund because "that was all he had </p><p>in his piggy bank." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To the American People c/o The Ambassador </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dear Sir: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>My family and I watched on television with unspeakable horror </p><p>the multiple terrorist attacks on symbols of your nation.  We </p><p>can only imagine for all eternity what manner of people these </p><p>are, what kind of womb brought people like these into the </p><p>world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It is easy at times like this to question the existence of </p><p>God but this is the time to emphasize the inscription on your </p><p>nation\'s currency which says for all eternity, "In God We </p><p>Trust."  In God we should trust for the souls of those lost. </p><p>In God we should trust for all those who have lost husbands, </p><p>wives, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, friends and </p><p>colleagues, for at times like this no words can fill the void </p><p>in our hearts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We are too far away to donate blood or help physically. </p><p>Please accept this check for the sum of N15,000 for the </p><p>American people for use in any way they deem fit to help </p><p>those in need. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is not an attack on the American people but on all </p><p>members of the human race who believe in the sanctity of the </p><p>human life.  For all of us, the unthinkable has happened, but </p><p>we all know that America will come out of this stronger.  The </p><p>New York skyline has changed but we know for sure that </p><p>someday the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center will rise </p><p>again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>God Bless the American People </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>/sgd/ </p><p>Okechukwu and Udo Nwobu </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
