<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000291 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POLITICAL ROUNDUP FEBRUARY 10 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter: Reason: 1.5(b) and </p><p>(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This periodic joint political report from Abuja and </p><p>Lagos includes: </p><p>--Second Round of Voter Registration </p><p>--New PDP Gubernatorial Caucuses </p><p>--Potential Party Coalition vs. Obasanjo </p><p>--Will AD Support Obasanjo? </p><p>--Counterfeit Voter Cards in Lagos </p><p>--Igbo Group Chooses Presidential Candidate </p><p>--Atiku Gets a New Title </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>SECOND ROUND OF VOTER REGISTRATION </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) </p><p>has completed its second round of voter registration for the </p><p>upcoming presidential elections.  While INEC has not </p><p>published the number of voters registered in this round, our </p><p>observations and discussions with numerous politicians </p><p>indicate the turnout was low.  Prior to this second round, </p><p>INEC reportedly gave the police the names of over two million </p><p>people who allegedly registered more than once during the </p><p>initial registration last September. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Perhaps further delaying finalization of the voters </p><p>list, press reports indicated the names of over one million </p><p>registrants in Kano state, the North,s most populous state, </p><p>might have been erased from INEC,s database due to computer </p><p>error.  INEC confirmed that it had experienced computer </p><p>errors, but declared the number of lost names to be </p><p>significantly less.  COMMENT: A Northern figure close to ANPP </p><p>candidate Muhammadu Buhari alleged that all Northerners in </p><p>INEC\'s computer department had been reassigned to other </p><p>duties and suggested that these moves were part of an effort </p><p>to manipulate upcoming polls.  Whether either part of this </p><p>allegation is true or not, many Northerners will decide to </p><p>believe it as it conforms to their fears.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>NEW PDP GUBERNATORIAL CAUCUSES </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) After protests two weeks ago at PDP Headquarters in </p><p>Abuja, the People,s Democratic Party leadership ordered new </p><p>gubernatorial caucuses in Kwara, Anambra, Osun and Borno. </p><p>The protests alleged material irregularities in the previous </p><p>caucuses in these states. The date has not been set yet for </p><p>Anambra and Osun.  The new primaries in Kwara and Borno took </p><p>place February 1 with results the same as the first caucuses. </p><p>No violence was reported.  No decision has been made </p><p>concerning protests of the Enugu caucus.  The party formally </p><p>approved the results of the Plateau caucus. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>POTENTIAL PARTY COALITION VS. OBASANJO </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Representatives from the majority of the new </p><p>political parties met in Abuja January 29 to discuss a </p><p>possible coalition.  The ostensible rationale for the </p><p>coalition was to oppose the two major parties and their </p><p>flagbearers, President Obasanjo and his fellow former </p><p>military Head of State, Muhammadu Buhari.  Several parties </p><p>had already convened presidential primaries and chosen their </p><p>candidates (UNPP, JP, NDP, and APGA).  As of right now, no </p><p>party has publicly committed itself to the idea, with its </p><p>suggestion of a joint opposition candidate.  Most of them </p><p>planned to "study" the concept further. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>WILL AD SUPPORT OBASANJO? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Riven by internal conflict, the already factionalized </p><p>AD may split again.  Much of the friction revolves around the </p><p>question of whether the party will support Obasanjo or field </p><p>its own candidate.  Apparently, most AD governors and the </p><p>faction loyal to National Chairman Abdulkadir support </p><p>Obasanjo.  However, two other factions opposed to Obasanjo </p><p>have issued public statements purporting that Abdulkadir has </p><p>been removed from office.  The Abdulkadir group is probably </p><p>larger than the other two factions combined.  Meanwhile, the </p><p>Yoruba leaders group, Afenifere, has been at loggerheads with </p><p>the AD governors for control of the party.  Partly because of </p><p>this competition and some longstanding antipathies between </p><p>Afenifere leaders and the President, Afenifere has delayed </p><p>enunciating its position on whether the AD should back </p><p>Obasanjo.  (COMMENT:  While the anti-Obasanjo factions in the </p><p>party do not seem to represent the majority, their activities </p><p>have made an untidy spectacle of the AD.  These factions may </p><p>be receiving support from Obasanjo opponents outside the </p><p>party.  In the end, the AD will likely support Obasanjo. </p><p>Although AD factionalism will diminish that endorsement\'s </p><p>value somewhat, it still will be seen by many as an </p><p>expression that Obasanjo is secure in the Southwest.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>COUNTERFEIT VOTER CARDS IN LAGOS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Newspapers reported the alleged confiscation of </p><p>two-five million fake voter registration cards last week. </p><p>Our contacts confirm that the actual event was the arrest of </p><p>a clerk who had been bribed to make five cards, with possibly </p><p>more on the way.  The clerk is still in detention, and no </p><p>other arrests have been made. (COMMENT: Once again the </p><p>sensationalist press got it wrong.  However, the publication </p><p>of such stories demonstrates how ready people are to believe </p><p>that electoral fraud will be on a massive scale and INEC is </p><p>either powerless to stop these designs or is complicit in </p><p>them. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>IGBO GROUP FAILS TO CHOSE CONSENSUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Ohaneze Ndigbo, the most influential Igbo leadership </p><p>group, has been unable to select a consensus candidate from </p><p>among the six Igbo candidates chosen by different parties. </p><p>The January 31 meeting Ohaneze held with the Igbo candidates </p><p>ended in stalemate.  APGA, the only predominately Igbo party, </p><p>argued that Ohaneze should first direct Igbos to the party </p><p>where their influence is the strongest, i.e. APGA.  If </p><p>APGA,s petition had been accepted, selection of its </p><p>candidate, controversial former Biafran leader Emeka Ojukwu, </p><p>would have been a foregone conclusion.  The other Igbo </p><p>candidates contended that Ohaneze should concentrate on </p><p>identifying the candidate most likely to win (clearly not </p><p>Ojukwu) and not on the parties.  (COMMENT: The fractious </p><p>nature of Igbo politics makes reaching a consensus very </p><p>difficult.  Ohaneze and the candidates will meet again in </p><p>Abuja the week of February 10-14 to continue discussions. </p><p>END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ATIKU GETS A NEW TITLE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Ooni of Ife, the preeminent Yoruba traditional </p><p>leader, conferred the Yoruba chieftancy title of &Aare </p><p>Adimula8 on Vice President Abubakar Atiku February 1 in an </p><p>apparent acceptance of the VP by the Yoruba leadership.  The </p><p>conferment was the Ooni,s way of repaying Atiku for standing </p><p>by Obasanjo during the PDP convention last month.  During the </p><p>ceremony, the Ooni stated that Atiku could be assured of </p><p>Yoruba support for &any future political activities,8 a not </p><p>too oblique reference to the 2007 presidential contest. </p><p>(COMMENT: Atiku February 7 told DCM he was very pleased with </p><p>the title and the implication of future support it conferred. </p><p> END COMMENT). </p><p>JETER </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
