<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001163 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LAGOS, PLEASE PASS TO FAS AND FCS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EFIN, EINV, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON IMPLEMENTS PROTECTIONIST TARIFF </p><p>SCHEDULE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 725 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1. (SBU) Introduction and Summary: On March 6, the </p><p>Government of Nigeria (GON) approved extensive, apparently </p><p>politically-motivated tariff amendments largely designed to </p><p>protect domestic special interests, particularly in </p><p>agriculture and the processed food sector.  Most domestic </p><p>manufacturers saw modest reductions in tariff rates on their </p><p>inputs while domestic manufacturers of some consumer goods </p><p>will benefit from large increases on the finished products of </p><p>their foreign competition.  A doubling of the tariff on rice </p><p>will ultimately translate into less disposable income for </p><p>urban Nigerians and added pressure on the consumer price </p><p>index.  Unfortunately, the new tariffs will do little to </p><p>improve domestic manufacturing or agricultural production, </p><p>and will not substantially augment revenue for the GON. </p><p>However, they do further damage to competitiveness in a </p><p>country that already has too many monopolistic forces at </p><p>work.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  ------------------ </p><p>PAY NOW, PAY LATER </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In the 2002 Fiscal Policy Measures and Tariff </p><p>Amendments, the GON sharply boosted tariff rates on a wide </p><p>range of processed food products contained within H.S. Code </p><p>Chapters 1-25.  In general, tariffs doubled for many </p><p>processed and unprocessed foods such as butter, cheeses, </p><p>vegetables, margarine, meat products, sugar (confectionary), </p><p>pasta, breakfast cereals, and chocolate.   The tariff on </p><p>polished milled rice (H.S. Code 1006.0000), an important </p><p>Nigerian staple, climbed from 75% to 100% in the Ministry of </p><p>Finance\'s March 6 tariff schedule.  Newspapers reported that </p><p>on March 27, the Federal Executive Council (cabinet) decided </p><p>to raise the tariff to 150%.  (Note: As of April 11, the </p><p>Ministry of Finance Deputy Director of Tariffs insisted that </p><p>the tariff was still 100%, though he said an amendment would </p><p>soon be released.  When pressed, he refused to say whether </p><p>rice tariffs would or would not be raised in the amendment. </p><p>A 150% tariff would have a much greater effect on the rice </p><p>market and consumer patterns than the currrent 100%.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) A few food products enjoyed tariff reductions. </p><p>Duties on all types of wheat (H.S. Code 1001.1000-9000) were </p><p>reduced from 10% to 5% -- a potential boost for U.S. wheat </p><p>exporters.  Flavoring and fruit juice concentrate (in bulk) </p><p>saw dramatic declines as the GON seeks to encourage more </p><p>domestic re-packaging operations.  (Nigerians consume </p><p>relatively large quantities of fruit juices.)  Domestically </p><p>produced Chivita brand fruit juices will not be heavily </p><p>impacted by the tariff reduction since it sources fruit </p><p>locally. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Luxury products were subjected to significant tariff </p><p>increases.  The rate on various tobacco products climbed from </p><p>80% to 150%.  However, Nigerians consume very little tobacco </p><p>per capita.  The higher tobacco tariff ultimately may benefit </p><p>British American Tobacco Company, which has proposed a $150 </p><p>million tobacco plant at Ibadan.  Duties on beverage items </p><p>(e.g. bottled water, wine, beer) went from 80-90 percent to </p><p>100 percent ) an adjustment designed to increase domestic </p><p>manufacturers\' competitiveness.  Again, in an attempt to </p><p>insulate domestic companies from cost-effective imports, </p><p>stiff tariff increases were registered on beauty </p><p>preparations, hair, and shaving products, as well as </p><p>furniture, cigarette lighters, scent and toilet sprays. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>Tariffs on Manufacturing Inputs Reduced </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) A wide range of inputs into the manufacturing process </p><p>recorded tariff reductions, including a reduction of duties </p><p>for all industrial machinery to a maximum 2.5% and exemption </p><p>from VAT.  Mean duties on many chemicals (H.S. Code chapters </p><p>25-40) were reduced from 15% to 10%, although the tariff on </p><p>aluminum sulphates (H.S. Code 2833.2400) doubled to 20% in an </p><p>apparent effort to stimulate production at the Aluminum </p><p>Smelting Plant (ALSCON) in Akwa-Ibom State.  Toilet paper </p><p>producer Star Paper Mill, Abia State, will most likely expand </p><p>its market share with the five-fold tariff increase on tissue </p><p>paper to 100% combined with lower tariffs on cellulose and </p><p>wood pulp.  Textile manufacturers benefit from higher tariffs </p><p>(65%-75%) on a range of woven fabrics both natural and </p><p>artificial.  Concurrently, base products for textile </p><p>production such as acrylics, nylons, viscoses, </p><p>polypropylenes, and vinyl fibers enjoy a lower 5% tariff. </p><p>Tariffs were adjusted both upwards and downwards on a wide </p><p>range of base metal products; the net effect should favor </p><p>heavy industry such as Nigerdock, Delta Steel, and the </p><p>unfinished Ajaokuta steel mill. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Obvious beneficiaries of the tariff amendments include </p><p>Nigerian pharmaceutical companies.  Lower tariffs of 5% </p><p>almost across the board will be applied to machinery and </p><p>electrical equipment (H.S. Code chapters 84-85), specifically </p><p>for "bona fide" pharmaceutical manufacturers.   The affected </p><p>items include injection molding and wrapping machinery, </p><p>software compact discs, and portable digital automatic data </p><p>processing machines.  Ironically, a special duty concession </p><p>granted last year to Procter & Gamble (manufacturer of </p><p>sanitary pads and diapers) enabling them to import assembly </p><p>line machinery at a 5% tariff, is now diluted by the lower </p><p>2.5% rate.  P&G had recently landed some machinery at the </p><p>higher 5% tariff.  In addition, P&G,s  strenuous attempt to </p><p>obtain a lower tariff on Ariel finished detergent proved </p><p>unsuccessful as the tariff jumped  from 40% to 100% (reftel). </p><p> This was clearly a victory for rivals Unilever and PZ </p><p>Industries, Plc., both U.K.- based companies producing </p><p>detergent in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Other fiscal policy measures included in the 2002 </p><p>Tariff Amendments include: imposition of an outright ban on </p><p>vehicles over 5 years old and used air conditioners (H.S. </p><p>Code 8418.2100) and compressors, prohibition of containers </p><p>originating in third countries entering Nigeria from its </p><p>neighbors, and continuation of the ban on imported bulk </p><p>vegetable oil.  The Nigerian Agency for Food and Drug </p><p>Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has implemented large </p><p>increases in fees for imported products as well as inspection </p><p>fees.  An export incentive in the form of a 5% grant is </p><p>offered for all agricultural cash crops -- of benefit to </p><p>potential exporters under AGOA.  The new measures terminate </p><p>pre-shipment inspection of imported goods by 1 July 2002; </p><p>Nigerian customs shall commence destination inspection on </p><p>that date ) it actually began 100% destination inspection in </p><p>June 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Back to the 70,s </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Import substitution would appear to be the major </p><p>theme of the 2002 tariff changes.  The GON officialdom </p><p>contends that the new rates will significantly reduce </p><p>domestic production costs, revitalize Nigeria,s industrial </p><p>sector, and expand agricultural production.  While lower </p><p>tariffs for capital equipment and inputs can augment </p><p>competitiveness, in the Nigerian context the impact may not </p><p>be significant.  As a portion of overall production costs, a </p><p>tariff decline of 15% to 5% for machinery or chemicals, for </p><p>example, may not be a sufficient fillip to reverse the </p><p>decade-long decline in Nigeria,s industrial productivity and </p><p>capacity utilization.  Other production costs, such as </p><p>maintaining generators, the high cost of access to capital, </p><p>other economic rents, security, and distribution bottlenecks </p><p>are as severe as ever. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Wealthy Nigerians and expatriates will likely pay more </p><p>for their food basket while the average Nigerian might </p><p>substitute local products for the higher priced imports. The </p><p>high-end consumers may be particularly galled to pay an even </p><p>more extortive price for products, such as cheese, that do </p><p>not have comparable domestic substitutes.  The ability of </p><p>middle class Nigerians to purchase processed food has been </p><p>dealt a severe blow.  Even locally-even produced items may </p><p>also see rent-seeking price increases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U)  Real economic harm may have come to Nigeria,s </p><p>increasingly hamstrung middle class.  While very few </p><p>Nigerians routinely purchase high value processed foods, </p><p>millions eat rice.  However, rice imports are notorious for </p><p>finding their way into the country below the full tariff </p><p>rate, through under-invoicing schemes and smuggling. </p><p>Importers report Nigerian customs collects a fixed "fee" per </p><p>ton for rice; a higher tariff will likely increase the "fee" </p><p>charged by Customs.  Ultimately, a portion of the higher </p><p>legitimate or illicit duty on rice will be passed to the </p><p>consumer.  Nigeria,s farmers are unable meet to Nigeria,s </p><p>appetite for rice, even with the benefit of this  new </p><p>protectionist measure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The tariff amendments are an attempt at a </p><p>comprehensive trade policy, but one based more on political </p><p>expediency than economic rationality.  As such, it will </p><p>likely result in higher food prices with little positive </p><p>impact on domestic manufacturing.  Moreover, the tariffs </p><p>appear to contravene West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) tariff </p><p>reduction objectives established last June.  GON tariff </p><p>policy has previously aimed at increasing GON revenue, but </p><p>there is a growing realization among some of the political </p><p>leadership that high tariffs merely encourage payment </p><p>avoidance.  Increased smuggling and tariff subterfuges are </p><p>more likely than increased revenue.  However, the GON appears </p><p>willing to stomach this consequence in order to score points </p><p>with important vested interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) In addition to the particulars of the tariff </p><p>increases and decreases, these changes as a group represent a </p><p>movement away from the principles of tariff reform: lower and </p><p>more uniform rates.  They appear to run counter to the trade </p><p>policy that was adopted last year with USAID\'s help.  As such </p><p>they may make eventual agreement on a new IMF program more </p><p>difficult, as the Fund was pushing for a 25% maximum as a </p><p>first step toward reform.  Also, to the extent the tariff </p><p>changes may reduce imports, they contribute to the </p><p>overvaluation of the Naira and make doing business with and </p><p>exporting from Nigeria more costly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) During a brief April 3 conversation with Ambassador </p><p>Jeter, Chief Economic Advisor Magnus Kpakol said that he had </p><p>argued against the amended tariff schedule up until its </p><p>approval at the last Federal Executive Council (Cabinet) </p><p>meeting.  Kpakol predicted that the higher tariffs would not </p><p>earn substantially more revenue.  He feared that even more </p><p>importers would seek to circumvent the new tariff structure, </p><p>particularly by bringing in items overland across Nigeria,s </p><p>porous borders.  Central Bank officials have expressed their </p><p>belief that Nigeria would earn more revenue from a low tariff </p><p>policy that encourages payment compliance, reduces the </p><p>incentive to evade payments, and ratchets down rent-seeking </p><p>opportunities and other corruptive behavior. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Perhaps the real tragedy surrounding the new policy </p><p>measures is that many Nigerians know they will not work. </p><p>Containers, old vehicles, and high tariff items will continue </p><p>to move across the border with Benin upon payment of the </p><p>appropriate "dash".   Nigerian manufacturers are likely to </p><p>gain little from their marginally reduced cost of production </p><p>inputs.  Meanwhile, protected companies will have no </p><p>incentive to increase efficiency and competitiveness but will </p><p>have a cushion to increase prices, especially on food </p><p>products. </p><p>15. (SBU) With elections now less than one year away, these </p><p>tariffs seem aimed at placing the Administration in the good </p><p>graces of various wealthy and influential special interests. </p><p>Apparently, in the Government,s electoral calculus, the </p><p>benefits of currying favor with this group outweigh the </p><p>grousing that will probably come from average Nigerians due </p><p>to higher tariffs and thus higher prices on consumer items </p><p>and food.  In short, the government decided to be politically </p><p>crafty but economically imprudent. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
