<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000137 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZVOBGO-AMBASSADOR MEETING </p><p> </p><p>REF: HARARE 64 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington.  Reasons: 1.5 ( </p><p>B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (C) ZANU-PF elder statesman Eddison Zvobgo told the </p><p>Ambassador January 15 that he preferred to keep his upcoming </p><p>trip to the U.S. focused primarily on personal business but, </p><p>at the Ambassador\'s suggestion, he agreed to consider </p><p>stopping in Washington.  Zvobgo discussed a faction within </p><p>the ruling party that wants Mugabe to resign, and named </p><p>General Solomon Mujuru and former Finance Minister Simba </p><p>Makoni as two of its most prominent members.  He said his </p><p>group planned to press for an extraordinary party congress to </p><p>deal with the national crisis and succession issues, and </p><p>solicited support for the group\'s efforts.  Zimbabwe, Zvobgo </p><p>believed, cannot survive another two years with Mugabe at the </p><p>helm without suffering irreparable damage.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On January 15, Amb and Poloff met with Eddison </p><p>Zvobgo, an elder statesman in the ruling party who has been </p><p>estranged from President Mugabe since 2000, to discuss the </p><p>political and economic future of Zimbabwe and ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Zvobgo lamented the deteriorating food situation and </p><p>commented that he had had to intervene on behalf of some of </p><p>his constituents/staff to procure corn from the Grain </p><p>Marketing Board (GMB).  Zvobgo told us that he had only </p><p>received 100 packets of corn meal yesterday, several weeks </p><p>after he contacted the GMB. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>TRIP TO THE US </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ambassador noted Zvobgo\'s planned trip to the U.S. </p><p>and suggested that Zvobgo stop in Washington.  Zvobgo at </p><p>first did not seem amenable to a Washington stop, stating </p><p>that he planned to go to Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago to </p><p>visit old friends but had not planned on pursuing a political </p><p>agenda.  He told us that he prefers to denounce and criticize </p><p>the government and ZANU-PF from within Zimbabwe thereby </p><p>exercising his rights of free speech.  Furthermore, he said </p><p>he did not see the point in such meetings in Washington as </p><p>the situation in Zimbabwe is debilitating.  The Ambassador </p><p>assured him that the meetings would not be public but </p><p>discreet.  In the end, Zvobgo agreed to discuss the utility </p><p>of such meetings with his wife and would let us know his </p><p>decision.  (NOTE: As reported reftel, Zvobgo previously told </p><p>poloff January 9 that he was traveling to the United States </p><p>in part to raise support for a rival faction within ZANU-PF. </p><p>END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>PARTY DISSENSION </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Zvobgo reiterated his earlier assertion to Poloff </p><p>that there exists a faction within the party that wants </p><p>Mugabe to resign.  The Ambassador asked who else was </p><p>involved.  Zvobgo named Solomon Mujuru, Simba Makoni, </p><p>Shadreck Beta from Manicaland, and a "Murerwa from Harare." </p><p>(Note:  The only Murerwa with which we are familiar is </p><p>Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa, who represents Goromonzi, a </p><p>consitutency which abuts Harare province, in Parliament.  End </p><p>Note). He did assure us that this faction was well </p><p>represented amongst veteran and younger party members. </p><p>Zvobgo said that the fight could best be carried from within </p><p>the party and that his group would press for an extraordinary </p><p>party congress to deal with the national crisis and </p><p>succession issues. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Zvobgo asked if the US might be willing to support </p><p>this </p><p>&party within a party.8  The Ambassador was noncommittal </p><p>but told Zvobgo that the US has nothing against ZANU-PF per </p><p>se but takes issue with the human rights and civil liberties </p><p>abuses perpetrated by the party leadership and the </p><p>government.  The Ambassador said the U.S. would be willing to </p><p>support groups of people who were working for a return to the </p><p>rule of law and a resumption of respect for human rights and </p><p>civil liberties.  Zvobgo seemed to accept this but wanted </p><p>assurances that any support would be discreet.  The </p><p>Ambassador reassured him on this count.  No specific types of </p><p>support were requested or discussed. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The Ambassador asked Zvobgo his opinion on the recent </p><p>press story about a possible Mugabe resignation.  Zvobgo </p><p>seemed to believe that the leak must have come from within </p><p>ZANU-PF, either someone who disliked the person rumored as </p><p>the heir apparent -- Speaker of Parliament Emmerson Mnangagwa </p><p>-- or who just wanted to shake things up.  He did not place </p><p>much credence in the story but agreed that Mugabe needs to </p><p>leave office before his term is up if Zimbabwe is to recover </p><p>economically.  Zvobgo was dismayed at the decline of </p><p>ZANU-PF\'s fortunes and blamed Mugabe.  The Ambassador </p><p>mentioned his meeting with General Mujuru on January 9 and </p><p>Mujuru,s proposal that Mugabe step down in two years, after </p><p>the parliamentary elections.  Zvobgo thought two years was </p><p>too long to wait--the country would be in ruins by that time </p><p>and the party would be irreparably damaged. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>PARLIAMENT </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Zvobgo told us he plans to propose a long-overdue </p><p>anti-corruption commission to Parliament after it resumes on </p><p>February 14.  This commission was called for in the 1990\'s </p><p>constitutional revision, but never implemented.  Zvobgo said </p><p>he has around seven ZANU-PF MPs who will support him.  He </p><p>said he had not introduced it sooner out of respect for the </p><p>younger MPs. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Zvobgo has long been dissatisfied with what has </p><p>happened to his party and he is a good source of information </p><p>on developments within ZANU-PF (He was a Politburo member for </p><p>20 years until being expelled by Mugabe in 2000 -- for honest </p><p>and public criticism of the Zimbabwean President -- and he </p><p>remains an MP and member of the somewhat less influential </p><p>Central Committee).  However, he told us several months </p><p>before the election that he was trying to coordinate public </p><p>statements from a number of ruling party heavyweights calling </p><p>on Mugabe not to contest.  As we know, no such statements </p><p>were ever issued, and Zvobgo sought temporary safehaven in </p><p>South Africa for a couple of months around that time after </p><p>expressing criticism of Mugabe.   Although he has had </p><p>difficulty in the past convincing others to follow in moves </p><p>against Mugabe and party leadership, further deterioration </p><p>here could push some of Zvobgo\'s more frightened party </p><p>colleagues finally to take a stand, purely out of </p><p>self-interest.  As we have reported recently, frustration is </p><p>growing within the Politburo, many members of which believe </p><p>Mugabe\'s departure is necessary, but none of whom have a </p><p>realistic plan or the guts to accomplish this, and none of </p><p>whom are interested in genuine reconciliation and cooperation </p><p>with the MDC. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
