(SBU) SUMMARY:  A State Department-sponsored Quick </p><p>Reaction Demining Force (QRDF) is preparing to leave </p><p>Sri Lanka after completing its program in war-torn </p><p>Jaffna.  U.S. involvement in sustained humanitarian </p><p>demining in Sri Lanka continues to earn rave reviews. </p><p>Mission looks forward to implementation of a follow-on </p><p>USG-sponsored demining program slated to kick off in </p><p>August.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) MISSION COMPLETED:  A State Department- </p><p>sponsored QRDF team is preparing to leave Sri Lanka </p><p>after completing its four-month program in war-torn </p><p>Jaffna.  (Note:  This is the second QRDF team that has </p><p>been deployed to Sri Lanka.  The first team worked in </p><p>Jaffna from April-October 2002.)  Since its deployment </p><p>to Jaffna in March 2003, the QRDF team made excellent </p><p>progress in humanitarian demining.  Operating near the </p><p>village of Sarasalai, roughly 20 kilometers east of </p><p>Jaffna town, the team -- which consisted of U.S. </p><p>managers from RONCO company, deminers from Mozambique, </p><p>and several dogs -- removed 244 mines and 106 pieces of </p><p>unexploded ordnance (UXO).  Total square meters cleared </p><p>as of July 17 -- the day the QRDF wrapped up its </p><p>demining program -- was 72,208. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) KUDOS FOR QRDF:  U.S. involvement in sustained </p><p>humanitarian demining in Sri Lanka continues to earn </p><p>rave reviews.  The Tamil community, for example, has </p><p>been effusive in its praise for the USG effort, noting </p><p>that the QRDF has assisted greatly in the safe return of </p><p>displaced persons to their points of origin. </p><p>(Note:  There are an estimated 500,000 IDPs left in Sri </p><p>Lanka, with about 300,000 returns since the advent of </p><p>the peace process in December 2001.)  Tamil contacts </p><p>have noted to us that the QRDF\'s efforts underscored </p><p>U.S. concern with the well-being of their community, as </p><p>well as USG support for the peace track.  "TamilNet," </p><p>the pro-Tamil Tiger website, has also placed a favorable </p><p>spotlight on the QRDF\'s activities in recent articles. </p><p>(Note:  TamilNet largely ignored the QRDF team that was </p><p>in Jaffna in 2002.)  Cooperation between the QRDF and </p><p>the Sri Lankan government has also been excellent. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) NEXT STEPS:  With respect to the USG\'s next </p><p>moves re demining, Mission is currently working with </p><p>PM/HDP to implement another State Department-sponsored </p><p>RONCO-led program in Sri Lanka.  Per Ref A, this </p><p>program, which is currently scheduled to begin in August </p><p>2003, would train Sri Lanka Army (SLA) deminers at a </p><p>facility in the southern part of the country.  This </p><p>"next step" program would assist in Jaffna demining, as </p><p>the SLA is implementing a large-scale demining program </p><p>in that area.  (Note:  SLA demining, in general, is not </p><p>up to international humanitarian standards, which is why </p><p>it needs extensive training.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) COMMENT:  As with its predecessor program in </p><p>2002, the QRDF has helped underscore strong U.S. support </p><p>for the peace process.  It has also helped undermine the </p><p>Tigers\' repeated assertion that international assistance </p><p>never gets through to Tamil majority areas.  Given the </p><p>importance of sustained involvement in this area, </p><p>Mission looks forward to implementation of the follow-on </p><p>USG-sponsored demining program described above.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
