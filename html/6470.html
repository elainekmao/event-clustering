(C) LOCAL EUROPEAN COMMISSION HOM WUNENBURGER TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT COMMISSIONER PATTEN, DURING A MARCH 13 VISIT </p><p>TO ZAGREB, EMPHASIZED THE GOC\'S NEED TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS ON </p><p>ICTY COOPERATION, REFUGEE RETURNS, JUDICIAL REFORM AND MEDIA </p><p>LEGISLATION.  MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT MESIC, PM RACAN AND KEY </p><p>PARLIAMENTARIANS WERE BRIEF DUE TO THE DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION </p><p>AND PATTEN\'S SUDDEN NEED TO VISIT BELGRADE. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN HIS PRE-BRIEF WITH WUNENBURGER, PATTEN EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN THAT IC PRESSURE ON SERBIA OVER ICTY HAD BEEN TOO </p><p>HARSH AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE ASSASSINATION.  THIS MAY ALSO </p><p>AFFECT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE EU PRESSES CROATIA ON ICTY. </p><p>THE COMMISSION WILL ISSUE ITS SAA IMPLEMENTATION REPORT ON </p><p>CROATIA IN ABOUT A WEEK.  WUNENBURGER RECOMMENDED SPECIFIC </p><p>BENCHMARKS ON RETURNS BE INCLUDED IN THE SAA REPORT TO GUIDE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00617  01 OF 03  181557Z </p><p>WORK ON THE AVIS ON CROATIA\'S APPLICATION OVER THE NEXT YEAR </p><p>BUT HE WAS UNSURE SUCH BENCHMARKS WOULD BE.  THE BENCHMARKS </p><p>HE LISTED WOULD MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE, BUT IN OUR VIEW </p><p>THE GOC WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO IMPLEMENT THEM. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) WUNENBURGER PERSONALLY BELIEVED THE GOC\'S UNHELPFUL </p><p>STANCE ON IRAQ HAD BEEN DRIVEN, IN PART, BY THE CALCULATION </p><p>THAT FRANCE WOULD BE DECISIVE WITH REGARD TO CROATIA\'S EU </p><p>APPLICATION.  WE SUSPECT HE IS RIGHT; TIME WILL TELL IF THE </p><p>GOC HAS JUDGED THAT RIGHT OR NOT AS THE EU EXPANDS TO 25 </p><p>MEMBERS, MOST OF WHICH ARE ON BOARD WITH THE IRAQ COALITION. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PATTEN\'S DIRECT MESSAGE </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) PATTEN\'S VISIT WAS LONG-SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS CROATIA\'S </p><p>EU APPLICATION AND ASSESS PROGRESS ON THE STABILIZATION AND </p><p>ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (SAA).  WHILE TRUNCATED DUE TO THE </p><p>DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION AND UNFORESEEN BELGRADE VISIT, PATTEN </p><p>WAS ABLE TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT MESIC, PM RACAN, AND SABOR </p><p>PRESIDENT TOMCIC TOGETHER WITH SABOR FOREIGN RELATIONS AND </p><p>EUROPEAN INTEGRATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS.  ALL MEETINGS WERE </p><p>BRIEF DUE TO THE BELGRADE IMPERATIVE.  NEITHER IRAQ NOR THE </p><p>DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION FIGURED MUCH.  IN EACH MEETING, PATTEN </p><p>STRESSED THE FOUR AREAS WHERE, HE SAID, CROATIA NEEDED TO USE </p><p>THE NEXT YEAR (UP TO ISSUANCE OF THE COMMISSION AVIS) TO MAKE </p><p>PROGRESS ON KEY POLITICAL AREAS: </p><p> </p><p>  --  FULL ICTY COOPERATION, NO FALTERING; </p><p>  --  ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT ACTUAL RETURNS OF REFUGEES; </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00617  01 OF 03  181557Z </p><p>  --  CONCRETE PROGRESS ON JUDICIAL REFORM; </p><p>  --  MEDIA LEGISLATION MEETING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THE GOC SIDE DID NOT PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT RESPONSES DUE </p><p>TO THE BREVITY OF THE MEETINGS, BUT MADE GENERAL ASSURANCES. </p><p>WITH REGARD TO THE GOC\'S ALLEGED FAILURE TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTS </p><p>REQUESTED BY THE ICTY PROSECUTOR, RACAN REPEATED THE GOC </p><p>POSITION THAT THIS IS BECAUSE ICTY\'S REQUESTS ARE TOO BROAD </p><p>AND VAGUE TO ANSWER -- WHICH, WUNENBURGER REMARKED, THE EC </p><p>KNOWS IS UNTRUE.  RACAN ASSERTED TO PATTEN THAT HE WOULD SHOW </p><p>HMG EVIDENCE PROVING THAT CROATIA\'S COMPLAINT ABOUT THE </p><p>NATURE OF THESE DOCUMENT REQUESTS WAS WELL FOUNDED WHEN HE </p><p>VISITED LONDON MARCH 18-19 (NOW CANCELLED).  ON RETURNS, THE </p><p>GOC GAVE GENERAL ASSURANCES. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) PATTEN ASSURED THE CROATIANS THAT THEIR APPLICATION </p><p>WOULD NOT BE IMPEDED BY THE RESURGENCE OF INSTABILITY IN </p><p>NEIGHBORING SERBIA; THAT BECAME THE MEDIA HEADLINES.  IN </p><p>FACT, WUNENBURGER COMMENTED, IT IS CLEAR TO HIM THAT THE </p><p>DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION WILL BOOST THE PROSPECTS FOR CROATIA\'S </p><p>APPLICATION -- HOWEVER GOOD OR BAD THE GOC\'S RECORD OF </p><p>MEETING THE EU\'S POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY -- BECAUSE THE EU </p><p>DOES SEE CROATIA AS, AND WANTS TO ENSURE IT REMAINS, A </p><p>COUNTRY OF RELATIVE STABILITY IN THE REGION.  ONLY A MAJOR </p><p>ICTY BLOWUP WOULD DERAIL THAT, IN WUNENBURGER\'S ASSESSMENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7143 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00617  02 OF 03  181557Z </p><p>ACTION SWCI-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  INL-00 </p><p>      USNW-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   E-00     VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  NSCE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------465D13  181601Z /38 </p><p>R 181546Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 9752 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERLIN </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>AMEMBASSY SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USOFFICE PRISTINA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 000617 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00617  02 OF 03  181557Z </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE/WHEATON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KAWC, ECIN, PREF, HR, EUN, SR </p><p>SUBJECT: PATTEN IN CROATIA:  DOUBTS OVER ICTY PRESSUE; WAY </p><p>AHEAD ON CROATIA\'S APPLICATION </p><p> </p><p>PATTEN: "TOO MUCH" PRESSURE ON WAR CRIMES? </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) WUNENBURGER SAID THAT PATTEN, IN THEIR PREBRIEF, </p><p>RUMINATED ABOUT THE TRAGEDY IN SERBIA AND HIS CONCERN THAT </p><p>THE ASSASSINATION MAY HAVE COME ABOUT IN PART DUE TO </p><p>EXCESSIVE IC PRESSURE FOR ICTY COMPLIANCE.  HE BELIEVED THIS </p><p>MIGHT INFLUENCE FUTURE COMMISSION (AND POSSIBLY EU) </p><p>APPROACHES NOT ONLY TOWARD SERBIA BUT ALSO TOWARD CROATIA AND </p><p>OTHER RELEVANT COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) FOR HIS OWN PART, WUNENBURGER EXPRESSED CONCERN LESS </p><p>ABOUT THE DEGREE OF PRESSURE ON CROATIA THAN ABOUT ICTY\'S </p><p>TACTICS HERE, WHETHER ITS INCLUSION OF BROAD HISTORICAL </p><p>ELEMENTS IN INDICTMENTS UNNECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL </p><p>PROSECUTIONS, ITS UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTIONS ABOUT GOTOVINA\'S </p><p>PRESENCE IN CROATIA OR ITS RELATIVELY LOWER PROFILE HANDLING </p><p>OF WHAT HE CALLED ITS MOST SERIOUS COMPLAINT, INADEQUATE </p><p>COOPERATION ON PROVIDING DOCUMENTS.  OTHER THAN THE </p><p>"HISTORICAL" ELEMENTS OF THE INDICTMENTS, WUNENBURGER\'S </p><p>CONCERNS CLOSELY MATCHED OUR OWN, ON WHICH WE HAVE RECENTLY </p><p>REPORTED (REFTELS).  HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH PATTEN RECENTLY MET </p><p>WITH CARLA DEL PONTE, WUNENBURGER UNDERSTOOD THAT PATTEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00617  02 OF 03  181557Z </p><p>RAISED NO SUCH CONCERNS WITH HER.  (THAT WAS BEFORE THE </p><p>DJINDJIC ASSASSINATION.) </p><p> </p><p>NEXT EU STEPS ON CROATIA </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) WUNENBURGER SAID THE COMMISSION SHOULD ISSUE ITS </p><p>ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF CROATIA\'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAA IN </p><p>ABOUT A WEEK.  IT WILL HIGHLIGHT AREAS OF PROGRESS AND </p><p>SHORTFALL ACROSS THE SAA BOARD, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE </p><p>POLITICAL CONDITIONS LISTED ABOVE.  THE SAA PROVIDES THE </p><p>COMMISSION WITH AN ADDED, CONCRETE FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING </p><p>ITS AVIS ON CROATIA\'S EU APPLICATION.  THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE </p><p>CASE WITH PREVIOUS APPLICATIONS.  (NOTE: CROATIA\'S </p><p>APPLICATION WAS SUBMITTED IN FEBRUARY; CROATIA HOPES IT WILL </p><p>BE FORWARDED BY THE COUNCIL TO THE COMMISSION FOR AVIS IN </p><p>APRIL BUT THIS MAY NOT OCCUR UNTIL JUNE.  A COUPLE OF </p><p>COUNTRIES, NOTABLY THE UK, HAVE NOT RATIFIED THE SAA YET AND </p><p>MAY SEEK TO IMPEDE COUNCIL ACTION ON THE APPLICATION.) </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) WUNENBURGER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR HE HAS RECOMMENDED </p><p>THE INCLUSION OF SPECIFIC RETURNS-RELATED BENCHMARKS IN THIS </p><p>YEAR\'S SAA REPORT: COMPLETION OF ALL PROPERTY RESTITUTION </p><p>THIS YEAR; ACTION ON ALL HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION APPLICATIONS </p><p>THIS YEAR; AND ESTABLISHMENT THIS YEAR OF A CONCRETE, </p><p>TRANSPARENT PROGRAM TO "COMPENSATE" THOSE WHO FORMERLY </p><p>ENJOYED OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS TO SOCIALLY-OWNED </p><p>PROPERTY.  HE SAID HE WAS UNSURE WHETHER THE COMMISSION WOULD </p><p>INCLUDE THESE. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) LOOKING AHEAD TO THE AVIS IN A YEAR OR SO, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00617  02 OF 03  181557Z </p><p>WUNENBURGER SAID THAT INCLUSION OF THESE BENCHMARKS AS WELL </p><p>AS THE GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF THE GOC\'S PERFORMANCE ON THE </p><p>POLITICAL CONDITIONS WOULD BE CENTRAL TO THE COMMISSION\'S </p><p>WORK.  DEPENDING ON THE COMMISSION\'S ASSESSMENT OF CROATIA\'S </p><p>(PERFORMANCE-PROVEN) READINESS TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>WITH THE EU, THE COMMISSION WOULD RECOMMEND TO THE COUNCIL </p><p>THAT THE APPLICATION BE ACCEPTED AND NEGOTIATIONS BEGUN; THAT </p><p>IT AND NEGOTIATIONS BE DEFERRED WITH SPECIFIC AREAS FOR GOC </p><p>EFFORT IDENTIFIED; OR THAT IT BE REJECTED.  THE LATTER WILL </p><p>NOT HAPPEN; HE WAS UNCERTAIN FROM HIS OWN VIEW OF CROATIA\'S </p><p>EFFORTS WHETHER IT WOULD GET A FAVORABLE OR A DEFERRED AVIS. </p><p>IN THE END, HE CAUTIONED, THE POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY WILL </p><p>WEIGH HEAVILY, BUT ALL FACTORS INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND LEGAL </p><p>ISSUES WILL BE "BALANCED," AND IN ANY CASE THE COUNCIL WILL </p><p>DECIDE; THE COMMISSION\'S AVIS IS JUST THAT, A RECOMMENDATION. </p><p> (THE COUNCIL ALMOST ALWAYS FOLLOWS COMMISSION </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS, HE NOTED, BECAUSE IT AND THE MEMBER STATES </p><p>ESSENTIALLY PRECOOK THE FINAL RECOMMENDATION.) </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) WE HOPE THAT WUNENBURGER\'S PROPOSED RETURNS </p><p>BENCHMARKS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE SAA REPORT.

IF THE GOC WERE TO ACT SERIOUSLY ON THOSE SPECIFIC </p><p>ISSUES, IT WOULD REPRESENT A SEA CHANGE IN ITS LACKLUSTER </p><p>RECORD ON RETURNS AND MERIT EU (AND OUR) RECOGNITION. </p><p>FRANKLY, HOWEVER, WE THINK THE GOC WOULD FAIL THE TEST, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN THIS ELECTION YEAR GIVEN THE INDIFFERENCE OR </p><p>HOSTILITY OF VOTERS TO DEVOTING GOC EFFORT AND RESOURCES TO </p><p>RETURNS. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) DOWN THE ROAD, HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE VIEWS </p><p>OF EU MEMBER STATES AND THEIR RELATIVE VIGOR IN PUSHING THEM </p><p>WITHIN THE COUNCIL WILL DECIDE THE FATE OF CROATIA\'S </p><p>APPLICATION.  IN THAT REGARD, WUNENBURGER\'S PERCEPTION THAT </p><p>THE GOC CHOSE TO SIDE WITH FRANCE AND GERMANY THIS WEEK ON </p><p>IRAQ BECAUSE IT SEES THEM AS THE MAIN ACTORS ON ITS </p><p>APPLICATION COUILD TURN OUT TO BE SIGNIFICANT, AND A MAJOR </p><p>ERROR.  CONSISTENTLY, THE GOC HAS FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT </p><p>THE EU HAS 15 -- SOON, 25 -- MEMBERS, AND THAT COUNTRIES SUCH </p><p>AS THE UK, SPAIN AND POLAND WILL ALSO DETERMINE THE FATE OF </p><p>ITS MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION.  BALKANS STABILITY CONSIDERATIONS </p><p>MAY LEAD THE LATTER GROUP TO SUPPORT CROATIA IN A YEAR\'S </p><p>TIME, OR THEY MAY NOT -- MUCH WILL DEPEND ON THE LENGTH OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00617  03 OF 03  181557Z </p><p>BRITISH AND SPANISH MEMORIES.
