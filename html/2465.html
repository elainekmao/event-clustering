<p>UNCLAS ROME 000603 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IT, IS, GZ, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN PROJECT ON TRACK II DIPLOMACY BETWEEN </p><p>ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SENSING THAT THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST HAS </p><p>REACHED "DESPERATE" MEASURES, THE ITALIAN MFA FUNDED AN </p><p>INITIATIVE CALLED "MEETING THE OTHER", A FORUM FOR ISRAELI </p><p>AND PALESTINIAN CIVIL SOCIETIES TO DIALOGUE.  THE FIRST OF </p><p>SUCH MEETINGS TOOK PLACE FEB 4. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) AMBASSADOR ANTONIO BADINI, THE MFA\'S DIRECTOR GENERAL </p><p>FOR THE MIDDLE EAST, OPENED THE MEETING BY STRESSING THAT </p><p>"MEETING THE OTHER" WAS NOT A VENUE FOR POLITICAL DEBATE, BUT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00603  090715Z </p><p>AN ATTEMPT TO PROMOTE CIVIL DIALOGUE IN DISCUSSING A POSSIBLE </p><p>COMMON FUTURE, AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO START A SOCIAL PROJECT </p><p>THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE IN THE REGION. </p><p>THERE WAS CONSENSUS AMONG THE AUDIENCE THAT EDUCATION OUGHT </p><p>TO BE THE TOPIC DISCUSSED IN THE NEXT MEETING (JUNE 2002). </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) MR. DAVID GROSSMAN, A WRITER, REPRESENTED THE ISRAELI </p><p>SIDE.  HE SAID THAT THE MAJOR CURRENT TRAGEDY IS THE ABSENCE </p><p>OF A LEADER, ISRAELI OR PALESTINIAN, WHO IS TRULY WILLING TO </p><p>OFFER HIS PEOPLE THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION: PEACE.  WHEN </p><p>ASKED IF THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT MAY PURSUE "UNILATERAL </p><p>SEPARATION", HE REPLIED THAT HE HOPED NOT.  EVEN THOUGH THE </p><p>ISRAELI PUBLIC IS TERRIFIED OF TERRORISM, GROSSMAN STRESSED </p><p>THAT THE HEART OF ZIONISM IS TO "ACHIEVE SOME NORMALITY, TO </p><p>BE ACCEPTED".  HE HOPED THAT THE ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP WOULD OPT FOR THE "MATURE BEHAVIOR": DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) PROFESSOR SARI NUSSEIBEH, DEAN OF AL QUDS UNIVERSITY, </p><p>REPRESENTED THE PALESTINIAN SIDE.  HE STARTED BY UNDERLINING </p><p>THAT YASSER ARAFAT IS INDEED THE ONLY LEADER OF THE PA AND </p><p>THAT HE OUGHT TO BE TREATED AS SUCH.  HE SAID THAT ONLY </p><p>PALESTINE CAN GIVE ISRAEL ITS "LEGITIMATE BIRTH CERTIFICATE", </p><p>AND THUS BOTH PEOPLE OUGHT TO THINK IN TERMS OF INCLUDING, </p><p>AND NOT EXCLUDING, EACH OTHER.  HE FINISHED BY STATING THAT </p><p>IT SERVES LITTLE PURPOSE TO TALK ABOUT THE PAST SINCE BOTH </p><p>PEOPLES ARE VICTIMS OF THE PAST.  WHAT MATTERS MOST, STRESSED </p><p>NUSSEIBEH, IS THE FUTURE AND THE ABILITY OF ISRAELIS AND </p><p>PALESTINIANS TO THINK IN TERMS OF "MUTUAL ACCEPTANCE". </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) COMMENT: EMBASSY WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW AND REPORT ON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00603  090715Z </p><p>"MEETING THE OTHER".  IT FITS WELL THE GOI THINKING: DEEP AND </p><p>GENUINE CONCERN ABOUT THE VIOLENCE; A WISH TO BE SUPPORTIVE </p><p>OF USG EFFORTS; AND A BELIEF THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS OF BOTH </p><p>ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS.  SUCH AN INITIATIVE FOR DIALOGUE </p><p>BETWEEN CIVIL SOCIETIES WILL NOT IN ITSELF SOLVE THE </p><p>ISRAELI/PALESTINIAN CONFLICT, BUT IT BROUGHT A COMFORTABLE </p><p>TONE TO AN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION.  "THERE IS MUTUAL TRUST </p><p>IN THIS ROOM BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS" WAS PERHAPS A </p><p>SLIGHTLY TOO OPTIMISTIC STATEMENT BY MR. GROSSMAN, BUT THERE </p><p>WAS CERTAINLY MORE "MUTUAL TRUST" IN THE CIVIL DIALOGUE THAN </p><p>IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL "DIALOGUE" BETWEEN SHARON AND </p><p>ARAFAT.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME00603 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
