<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000549 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:20MAR2013 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, CASC, KFLO, MARR, PREL, PINR, AMGT, IZ, NI </p><p>SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: NIGERIA: NO DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST IRAQ WAR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: 1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) SUMMARY: The critical Friday flashpoint has passed </p><p>quietly, with no reports of demonstrations against the U.S.- </p><p>led Coalition of the Willing (COW) taking place in Abuja or </p><p>elsewhere.  Stern warnings by the authorities and moderate </p><p>sermons in Juma\'at Mosques probably helped.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The critical Friday afternoon flashpoint (1330-1530) </p><p>passed quietly March 21, with no reports of demonstrations </p><p>against the U.S.-led Coalition of the Willing (COW) taking </p><p>place.  Public sentiment remains strongly against the attack, </p><p>with both Christians and Muslims condemning it.  Both northern </p><p>and southern press reports have concentrated on opposition to </p><p>the war, concentrating on statements by the Pope, the French </p><p>and anyone else with negative comments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Police officials had warned evening of March 20 that </p><p>demonstrations against the war on Iraq would not be allowed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Imams and pastors throughout the country have been </p><p>holding vigils, praying for the innocent victims of the war. </p><p>Until now, though, the message has been to remain calm, with </p><p>some Imams advising the faithful that, while the COW efforts </p><p>were an attack on Islam, demonstrations would only be hijacked </p><p>by those with ulterior motives.  The result would be injured </p><p>innocents and substantial property losses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: Stern warnings by authorities, the calls for </p><p>restraint by key Imams (including the Chief Imam of the Abuja </p><p>National Mosque) and some Emirs, a pervasive sense of fatalism </p><p>and the seemingly slow pace of the military campaign (and the </p><p>lack of credible reports of huge civilian casualties) have </p><p>combined to diminish the immediate impetus to demonstrate </p><p>against the COW\'s intervention in Iraq.  However, it is too </p><p>early to believe that the potential for protests, including </p><p>some that might turn violent, has passed.  The Embassy will </p><p>continue to monitor the security situation for developments </p><p>which might produce demonstrations as the Coalition campaign </p><p>continues. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
