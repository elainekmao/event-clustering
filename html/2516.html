(SBU) SUMMARY:   The Lower House of Parliament </p><p>ratified the state of national emergency by well over </p><p>the two-thirds majority necessary to continue the </p><p>emergency for another three months.  The three largest </p><p>Opposition parties voted with the ruling Nepali Congress </p><p>Party for ratification after Communist Party of Nepal - </p><p>United Marxist Leninist (UML) leader Madhav Nepal </p><p>extracted several concessions--including an agreement to </p><p>amend the Constitution to allow for an interim all-party </p><p>government during national elections--from Prime </p><p>Minister Deuba and Nepali Congress Party President G.P. </p><p>Koirala.  This rare display of national unity is a </p><p>heartening departure from the more typical politics of </p><p>self-interest that has helped weaken popular confidence </p><p>in democracy.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>A HARD DAY\'S NIGHT AT PARLIAMENT </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  After an all-day session, the House of </p><p>Representatives in Parliament voted at 8:00 p.m. Feb. 21 </p><p>to ratify the state of national emergency, declared by </p><p>King Gyanendra November 26, allowing its continuation </p><p>for an additional three months.  Of the 205-member </p><p>House, 194 MPs voted for ratification; 7 (from three </p><p>small far-left parties) voted against; 3 MPs were </p><p>absent; and 1 (Speaker Taranath Ranabhat) did not vote. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) MPs from the three largest Opposition parties-- </p><p>the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist Leninist </p><p>(UML); the Rastriya Prajatantra Pakshye (RPP); and the </p><p>Nepal Sadbhavana Pakshye (NSP) all voted with the </p><p>governing Nepali Congress (NC) Party.  Support from the </p><p>UML, which controls 64 seats in the House to the Nepali </p><p>Congress\' 113, was critical to Prime Minister Sher </p><p>Bahadur Deuba\'s bid for ratification, which requires a </p><p>two-thirds majority vote for passage. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>BACKROOM WHEELING, DEALING </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Although the party was not expected to block </p><p>ratification, up until the actual vote, the UML had not </p><p>publicly revealed its thinking on the emergency.  (Some </p><p>observers speculated its MPs might boycott the vote, </p><p>leaving the Nepali Congress with a two-thirds majority </p><p>of MPs present, thereby ensuring ratification of the </p><p>emergency without the UML actually having to articulate </p><p>support for the Government.)  According to Jhala Nath </p><p>Khanal, head of the UML\'s International Department, the </p><p>party had already consulted with and obtained consensus </p><p>from the RPP and the NSP on what changes (i.e., </p><p>concessions) from the Government of Nepal (GON) to ask </p><p>for as part of the ratification vote.  The UML had </p><p>already approached both Nepali Congress President and </p><p>former Prime Minister G. P. Koirala and current Prime </p><p>Minister Deuba separately with a similar pitch.  Deuba </p><p>"was a bit hesitant," Khanal said, fearing that former </p><p>PM and current Nepali Congress Party President G.P. </p><p>Koirala would use concessions granted to the Opposition </p><p>as ammunition in his ongoing efforts to oust Deuba. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>KOIRALA SAYS NEPALI CONGRESS MUST CLEAN HOUSE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The UML\'s proposed reforms include long-pending </p><p>anti-corruption legislation; legislation aimed at </p><p>expanding rights for women and members of the lower </p><p>castes; and amendments to the Constitution to allow for </p><p>an all-party interim government during national </p><p>elections and at times of national crisis.  The </p><p>Opposition also was pushing the GON to define more </p><p>clearly the parameters of the emergency, including which </p><p>activities are banned or permitted.  (Specifically, the </p><p>Opposition is hoping to have lifted for mainstream </p><p>political parties an indefinite, selectively applied ban </p><p>on political meetings.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  G.P. Koirala\'s address to Parliament Feb. 21 </p><p>indicated agreement--at least for now--with many of the </p><p>Opposition\'s proposed reforms.  Corruption should be </p><p>vigorously prosecuted, and the considerable assets </p><p>amassed by many former Ministers should be carefully </p><p>scrutinized, he said, beginning with the Nepali Congress </p><p>Party.  (He stopped short of saying the considerable </p><p>assets of former Prime Ministers should undergo similar </p><p>scrutiny.)  The size of the current cabinet should be </p><p>cut by half--to about 10 percent of the membership of </p><p>the Lower House.  All parties should unite together in </p><p>"a broader democratic alliance" to confront the socio- </p><p>economic problems in the country.  Finally, MPs should </p><p>be prepared to consider appropriate amendments to the </p><p>Constitution. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  In his speech UML General Secretary and </p><p>Opposition Leader Madhav Nepal condemned Maoist violence </p><p>and called on the insurgents to resume negotiations. </p><p>But he also criticized the GON for failing to deliver </p><p>promised reforms and economic development.  He asked for </p><p>a public commitment from the PM for greater progress on </p><p>these fronts.  The session then broke up just before the </p><p>PM was scheduled to speak while Madhav Nepal, along with </p><p>Deuba and Koirala, huddled together in the lobby, </p><p>according to a UML Central Committee member.  During </p><p>that conversation, Deuba reportedly gave Koirala and </p><p>Nepal the chance to look over and approve the draft of </p><p>his closing speech before the vote. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>DEUBA AGREES TO CONSIDER AMENDING CONSTITUION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  In Deuba\'s closing remarks before the House, he </p><p>committed to consider suggestions for amending the </p><p>Constitution and to present a thorough set of reforms, </p><p>including anti-corruption and administrative reform </p><p>legislation, during the current session of Parliament. </p><p>In addition, he agreed to issue clearer regulations </p><p>defining proscribed and permitted activities during the </p><p>state of emergency.  With these concessions in hand, the </p><p>80 Opposition MPs from the UML, RPP, and NSP voted with </p><p>their Nepali Congress colleagues to ratify the </p><p>emergency. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) When asked whether he expected Deuba to honor </p><p>those commitments, especially suggested amendments that </p><p>would allow a national government, the UML\'s Khanal said </p><p>the PM had "theoretically" agreed to the proposals.  The </p><p>UML will have to wait and see how that theoretical </p><p>acceptance translates into action when/if the GON brings </p><p>forward the amendments.  Other UML proposals, such as a </p><p>comprehensive land reform package, will be harder for </p><p>the Nepali Congress Party, which counts many wealthy </p><p>landlords among its members, to swallow, Khanal </p><p>predicted.  He added that the Nepali Congress has </p><p>previously broken commitments made to the UML on several </p><p>occasions; this time may be no different.  (Note: </p><p>Already variations in interpretation regarding what </p><p>exactly Deuba committed to are emerging.  For example, </p><p>although the UML proposed amendments allowing an all- </p><p>party interim government both during times of national </p><p>crisis and during national elections, two Nepali </p><p>Congress MPs both told us Deuba had undertaken to </p><p>consider the possibility of an interim government during </p><p>national elections only.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  Madhav Nepal had quietly let it be known </p><p>that the UML would not obstruct ratification of the </p><p>emergency, but Deuba obviously wanted the explicit </p><p>support of the Opposition to show a united front.  The </p><p>Opposition leader clearly saw an opportunity to wring </p><p>some public concessions from the PM--even if his own </p><p>people see scant chance of their fulfillment--before </p><p>consenting.  The shocking brutality of the attacks in </p><p>Achham, which left nearly 140 dead in just a few hours, </p><p>undoubtedly strengthened Deuba\'s hand in pushing for </p><p>ratification of the emergency.  The Maoists have shown </p><p>they are resolved to fight; mainstream political leaders </p><p>are apparently figuring out at long last that they will </p><p>have to show resolve as well.  Even Koirala appears to </p><p>have got the message to put his personal ambitions on </p><p>hold for the time being and desist from, at least for </p><p>now, the usual intra-party maneuvering.  This rare </p><p>display of national unity is a heartening departure from </p><p>the more typical politics of self-interest that has </p><p>helped weaken popular confidence in democracy.  End </p><p>comment. </p><p> </p><p>Malinowski </p><p></p></div>
