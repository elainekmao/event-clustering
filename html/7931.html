<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 001085 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR WHA/CEN AND EB </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p>LA PAZ - PLEASE PASS USAID FOR TODD SLOAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, EAID, PREL, SOCI, PINR, HO </p><p>SUBJECT:  CHANGING THE POLITICAL PARADIGM-MUNICIPAL </p><p>ASSOCIATION DEFEATS EFFORT TO IMPOSE A PARTISAN DIRECTOR </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Tegucigalpa 558 </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  The Honduran Municipal Association (AMHON) </p><p>preserved its political independence and nonpartisan </p><p>character by selecting a municipal development professional </p><p>as Executive Director despite a six month effort by the </p><p>Minister of Government and dark-side members of Congress to </p><p>impose a politically beholden Nationalist party member as </p><p>Executive Director.  This come-from-behind victory for the </p><p>maturing municipal government forces, who were aided by the </p><p>USG and other international donors, represents an important </p><p>political counterbalance to the Maduro Administration\'s now- </p><p>revealed efforts to reap maximum partisan advantage out of </p><p>its political decentralization program.  It is also a huge </p><p>step for the good government and anti-corruption forces </p><p>because the AMHON Board of Directors broke from established </p><p>political tradition, where decisions are made behind closed </p><p>doors based on partisan preferences, by using a professional </p><p>and transparent selection process.  This highly atypical </p><p>selection process for a Honduran institution could serve as </p><p>a model for other entities, furthering the development of </p><p>democracy and decentralization in Honduras.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  On April 29 the Honduran Municipal Association (AMHON) </p><p>Board of Directors (composed of 12 Nationalist Party Mayors, </p><p>11 Liberal Party Mayors, and one Christian Democrat Mayor,) </p><p>held a regularly scheduled meeting in Tela where they </p><p>selected a new Executive Director, Miguel Angel Munguia, to </p><p>replace the embattled Guadalupe Lopez (reftel).  AMHON </p><p>extended an invitation to international donors to attend the </p><p>meeting as observers in order to continue to provide </p><p>independent guarantees of transparency in the finalization </p><p>of the selection process.  A USAID Municipal Development </p><p>Officer attended, and was accompanied by Alfredo Stein </p><p>(Swedish aid agency) and Jose Antonio Samperi (Spanish aid </p><p>agency). </p><p> </p><p>3.  The reasoned debate that transpired during the meeting </p><p>was in stark contrast to previous gatherings during the last </p><p>four months where emotional partisan squabbles dominated the </p><p>discussion.  Particularly disruptive were the previous </p><p>provocations by Nationalist Mayors in AHMON to remove the </p><p>Executive Director (reftel).  It appears that this time, the </p><p>Board\'s decisions were based on genuine consensus and truly </p><p>reflected the will of the organization as a whole.  (Note: </p><p>Donors\' continued interest and follow-up on this issue, not </p><p>to mention their presence during the deliberations, were an </p><p>influence in this outcome.  Ambassador Palmer met on a </p><p>number of occasions separately with the Minister of </p><p>Government and select groups of mayors to help push this </p><p>process to its successful resolution. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>4. Four finalists for the position of Executive Director </p><p>were presented to the Board of Directors for their decision. </p><p>Although AHMON\'s by-laws state that a simple majority can </p><p>select an Executive Director, the board decided to reach a </p><p>consensus on the new candidate.  (Comment:  Throughout the </p><p>meeting, there were constant mentions of the need for the </p><p>board to get beyond the partisan positions that had been </p><p>dividing them in the past; almost a plea to get back to real </p><p>business.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>5. Members of the selection committee reported to the Board </p><p>of Directors on the interviews that were conducted and all </p><p>reaffirmed the transparent and professional nature of the </p><p>selection process, indicating that they learned a great deal </p><p>by going through this process.  Of the four finalists, </p><p>Miguel Angel Munguia was selected by consensus.  Mr. Munguia </p><p>currently works as a regional coordinator for the Honduran </p><p>Foundation for Municipal Development (FUNDEMUN).  Munguia </p><p>has a long history of working with municipalities in </p><p>technical positions and does not have an overt political </p><p>affiliation.  He has a reputation as a solid professional </p><p>and is well known to Post. </p><p> </p><p>6. COMMENT:  In a significant setback for Jorge Ramon </p><p>Hernandez Alcerro, the Minister of Government, many of the </p><p>Nationalist Party mayors who had towed the party line in </p><p>previous meetings have now distanced themselves from him and </p><p>the other Nationalist Party members of Congress who sought </p><p>to influence the selection of the new Executive Director. </p><p>In conversations both before and after the meeting, it </p><p>appears a number of Nationalist mayors decided to reject the </p><p>external partisan manipulation that was being applied to </p><p>them.  Further, it appears that this hiring decision could </p><p>prove to be an important moment for AMHON\'s growing </p><p>political independence in that Nationalist mayors, annoyed </p><p>by continued pressure from their party, are now willing to </p><p>stake out positions that are critical, yet constructive, on </p><p>real issues that are effecting their municipalities. </p><p>7. COMMENT CONTINUED:  The transparent selection of a new </p><p>AHMON Executive Director has been a highly atypical process </p><p>for a Honduran institution.  Normally, high-level </p><p>managerial/ministerial positions are essentially chosen </p><p>behind closed doors based on partisan preferences by the </p><p>party holding the majority.  AMHON\'s example may well serve </p><p>as a model for other Honduran entities to emulate, </p><p>especially in lieu of the relevance AMHON has for the </p><p>further development of democracy and decentralization in </p><p>Honduras.  U.S. mission support from the Ambassador to USAID </p><p>Municipal Development officer provided the critical measure </p><p>of support needed to overcome the intense political pressure </p><p>being exerted by Maduro Administration officials and </p><p>National Congress Members, including the Majority Leader of </p><p>the Congress and Party Whip.  END COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
