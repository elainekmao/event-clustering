<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 000714 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR D, INR/R/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS(FOR JWALLER); SA/PD (FOR LJIRWIN, LSCENSNY, </p><p>WREINCKENS); SSA/PAB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, PTER, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE, EGEN, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA PLAY - AMBASSADOR WILLS\' 4/24 REUTERS </p><p>INTERVIEW ABOUT LTTE SUSPENSION OF TALKS </p><p> </p><p>1.  On April 21, the LTTE announced it was suspending peace </p><p>talks. In a letter to the GSL, the LTTE listed its reasons </p><p>for suspending talks as: its exclusion from the 4/14 </p><p>Washington Conference, problems with the ceasefire accord </p><p>implementation, and that GSL had not focused enough on </p><p>rebuilding the economy of the North and East. On April 24, </p><p>Reuters ran an exclusive interview with Ambassador Wills </p><p>focusing on USG reaction to this letter.  The full text of </p><p>the interview was later released to the press (Reftel </p><p>Colombo 0707).  In addition to Reuters and Agence France- </p><p>Presse, nearly all major English, Tamil and Sinhala dailies </p><p>carried the story, some with the full text of the </p><p>interview.  Major television and radio stations did the </p><p>same.  There were no editorials.  Given the extensive </p><p>attention from the dailies, we expect less weekend paper </p><p>news coverage. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Television and Radio. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>2. In their 4/24 newscasts,  independent and government- </p><p>owned Sri Lankan telecasters (MTV, SLRC, ITN, Swarnavahini </p><p>and TNL) and radio stations carried the Ambassador\'s </p><p>interview as a headline story.  Ambassador Wills also spoke </p><p>with BBC World\'s television program Asia Today. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Newspapers. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>3. The Ambassador\'s comments were headlined by all major </p><p>English, Sinhala, and Tamil dailies.  The independent </p><p>English daily, the MIRROR ran the headline "Get back to </p><p>talks - US tells Tigers" with the full text of the </p><p>interview on the second page.  Government-owned English </p><p>DAILY NEWS ran "U.S., France urge return to peace table" </p><p>below the fold, and mentioned France only briefly.  Both </p><p>the MIRROR and DAILY NEWS articles highlighted the US </p><p>desire for the Tigers to return to negotiations, negative </p><p>Tiger behaviors, development assistance, and the need for </p><p>the LTTE to give up terrorism to gain international </p><p>recognition.  Opposition English daily, the ISLAND led </p><p>with,"LTTE should return to negotiating table - Ashley </p><p>Wills."   They covered the same topics, (but selected </p><p>excerpts somewhat more critical of the LTTE), and included </p><p>the full text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4/24 Tamil headlines were similar.  Independent Tamil </p><p>daily, Virakesari  reports:"US request Tigers to attend </p><p>talks" continuing "...if the Liberation Tigers wish to </p><p>represent the Tamil people in fulfilling their aspirations, </p><p>they cannot pull out but should participate at the peace </p><p>talks" and significant excerpts of the text.  Under the </p><p>headline,"Tigers should not pull out from talks; Must </p><p>attend Tokyo Conference" - requests US," Independent Tamil </p><p>daily, Thinakkural noted "Today, world\'s attention on Sri </p><p>Lanka is more than ever before. The international community </p><p>will be watching closely to see that no one\'s rights get </p><p>abused systemically once a final settlement is found. If </p><p>Tigers wish to be respected, they should accept the true </p><p>situation and work together with the government to build a </p><p>new Sri Lanka. Tigers should not pull out from talks with </p><p>the government. They also should attend the Tokyo Aid </p><p>Conference, said the US Ambassador for Sri Lanka Ashley </p><p>Wills."  State owned Tamil daily, Thinakaran\'s headline </p><p>article, "US informs Tigers to resume talks" continued with </p><p>"US requests Tamil militants to attend talks as that is the </p><p>only way to wipe out the sufferings of Tamil people.  LTTE </p><p>has informed that it is temporarily pulling out of peace </p><p>talks showing that nothing has been done to uplift the </p><p>standard of living of the Tamil people in the north and </p><p>East and for not being invited to the Washington </p><p>Meeting...If LTTE wishes to safeguard the welfare of the </p><p>Tamil people, they should not pull out but attend the peace </p><p>talks, said US Ambassador Ashley Wills....Further he said, </p><p>that the government and the LTTE should honor the </p><p>conditions in the ceasefire agreement during the time of </p><p>the suspension of talks." </p><p> </p><p>Headlines in the Sinhala dailies were more slanted against </p><p>the LTTE.   Government-owned Sinhala daily DINAMINA led </p><p>with "Return to negotiation table; announcement of </p><p>withdrawal from Japan talks is a great mistake - America </p><p>tells LTTE," and reported "America has pointed out to LTTE </p><p>that it has done a big mistake with this </p><p>announcement..Facts like assassination of opponents, child </p><p>soldier issues, ransom etc do not help build any confidence </p><p>on the LTTE.LTTE had earlier stated that exclusion from </p><p>Washington talks, no progress in the north development </p><p>process etc, paved way to their decision of withdrawal..But </p><p>Mr. Ashley Wills stated that the exclusion was because of </p><p>US\'s seeing them as terrorists .."  Independent Sinhala </p><p>daily LANKADEEPA led with, "America rejects tiger </p><p>reasoning" and reported "If they genuinely represent Tamils </p><p>they should not have flee from the negotiations table... </p><p>Did not LTTE engage in violations of MOU, ransoms, child </p><p>soldier recruitment?  American Ambassador requests to </p><p>return to peace talks.."  Independent Sinhala daily DIVAINA </p><p>ran, "If LTTE respects Tamil people\'s rights, they should </p><p>have not withdrawn from peace talks" - US Ambassador Ashley </p><p>Wills," and continued "If they are genuine on Tamil </p><p>people\'s interests, they should attend peace talks... Blame </p><p>should not be only on SLG... Solution only through </p><p>negotiations... Devolution of power a possible solution... </p><p>Sri Lanka should be one country... All ethnicities rights </p><p>can be protected only through a democratic system... Tiger </p><p>objective should be achieving peace as quickly as </p><p>possible... Their acts delay this... delay the day of Tamil </p><p>communities living in a peaceful environment... They have </p><p>already missed several opportunities..." </p><p> </p><p>International coverage began with the exclusive granted to </p><p>Reuters (4/23) , "U.S. urges Tamil Tigers to return to </p><p>peace table."  Agence France-Presse (4/24) also carried </p><p>excerpts from the interview under the headline "US slams </p><p>Tigers over pull out from Sri Lanka talks,"  and began with </p><p>"The United States Thursday slammed Tamil Tiger guerrillas </p><p>for suspending peace talks with the Colombo government and </p><p>warned the rebels they must renounce "terrorism" and resume </p><p>negotiations."  The Hindu of India (4/24) states, "LTTE </p><p>pursuing violent, separatist agenda: U.S." </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
