<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 12 AMMAN 004929 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB/IFD/OIA </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS TO USTR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, KTDB, KIDE, EFIN, ECON, ETRD, JO, OPIC </p><p>SUBJECT:  JORDAN: 2003 INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 128494 </p><p> </p><p>1. OPENNESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT </p><p> </p><p>SINCE KING ABDULLAH SUCCEEDED TO THE THRONE IN </p><p>1999, JORDAN HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ENCOURAGE FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTMENT.  KEY REFORMS HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN </p><p>THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TOURISM, AND SERVICES </p><p>SECTORS.  FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INVESTMENT LAWS </p><p>GRANT SPECIFIC INCENTIVES TO INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE, </p><p>HOTELS, HOSPITALS, MARITIME AND RAIL </p><p>TRANSPORTATION, LEISURE AND RECREATION PROJECTS, </p><p>CONVENTION AND EXHIBITION CENTERS, TRANSPORTATION </p><p>AND DISTRIBUTION OF WATER, GAS, AND OIL/OIL </p><p>DERIVATIVES USING PIPELINES WERE ADDED TO THIS </p><p>LIST.  THE LAWS ALSO ALLOW THE CABINET FLEXIBILITY </p><p>IN OFFERING INVESTMENT INCENTIVES TO OTHER SECTORS. </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN ACCEDED TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION </p><p>(WTO) IN APRIL 2000.  IN ADDITION, A U.S.-JORDAN </p><p>FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (FTA) ENTERED INTO FORCE ON </p><p>DECEMBER 17, 2001.  IN MAY 2001, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>CONVERTED THE AQABA PORT AND SURROUNDING AREA INTO </p><p>A SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE (SEZ) OFFERING SPECIAL </p><p>INCENTIVES TO INVESTORS (SEE BELOW).  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS REVAMPING THE INVESTMENT PROMOTION </p><p>SYSTEM IN JORDAN.  IT IS RE-EXAMINING INVESTMENT </p><p>INCENTIVES, AND IS CONSIDERATING THE CONSOLIDATION </p><p>OF ALL INVESTMENT PROMOTION ACTIVITIES UNDER A NEW </p><p>"JORDANIAN AGENCY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (JAED)". </p><p>THESE DEVELOPMENTS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO EXPANDED </p><p>INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN JORDAN FOR U.S. </p><p>INVESTORS. </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN\'S INVESTMENT LAWS TREAT FOREIGN AND LOCAL </p><p>INVESTORS EQUALLY, WITH THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS </p><p>(AS PER REGULATION NO. 54 OF 2000, ENTITLED "NON- </p><p>JORDANIAN INVESTMENTS PROMOTION REGULATION"): </p><p> </p><p>-- FOREIGN INVESTORS MAY NOT OWN MORE THAN 50 </p><p>PERCENT OF PROJECTS IN: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--CONSTRUCTION AND CONTRACTING; </p><p>-- WHOLESALE AND RETAIL TRADE; </p><p>--TRANSPORT  (MARITIME, AIR AND TRAIN </p><p>TRANSPORT) AND AUXILIARY SERVICES; </p><p>-- WASTEWATER TREATMENT; </p><p>--FOOD SERVICES; </p><p>--TRAVEL AGENT SERVICES; </p><p>--IMPORT AND EXPORT SERVICES; </p><p>--ADVERTISING SERVICES; </p><p>-- A NUMBER OF BUSINESS-RELATED AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>SERVICES; </p><p> </p><p>--UNDER THE TERMS OF THE U.S.-JORDAN FTA, FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTORS ARE LIMITED TO 60 PERCENT OWNERSHIP IN </p><p>PUBLISHING AND IN AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR </p><p>SERVICES. </p><p> </p><p>--FOREIGN INVESTORS MAY NOT HAVE WHOLE OR PARTIAL </p><p>OWNERSHIP OF: </p><p>--INVESTIGATION AND SECURITY SERVICES; </p><p>--SPORTS CLUBS (EXCEPT FOR HEALTH CLUBS) </p><p>--STONE QUARRYING FOR CONSTRUCTION PURPOSES </p><p>--CUSTOMS CLEARANCE SERVICES </p><p>--LAND TRANSPORTATION OF PASSENGERS AND CARGO </p><p>USING TRUCKS, BUSES AND TAXIS. </p><p> </p><p>A MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENT OF JD 50,000 (USD </p><p>70,000) IS SET FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS. THIS </p><p>REQUIREMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>PUBLIC SHAREHOLDING COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>BLIC SHAREHOLDING COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS NO FORMAL SCREENING OR HOST GOVERNMENT </p><p>SELECTION PROCESS FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT.  HOWEVER, </p><p>INVESTORS IN LARGE PROJECTS FIND THAT THE INFORMAL </p><p>APPROVAL OF LOCAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS </p><p>HELPS TO ENSURE GOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION IN PROJECT </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION. </p><p> </p><p>THE LAW STIPULATES THAT EXPROPRIATION IS PROHIBITED </p><p>UNLESS DEEMED IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.  IT PROVIDES </p><p>FOR FAIR COMPENSATION TO THE INVESTOR IN </p><p>CONVERTIBLE CURRENCY. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT MADE MODEST PROGRESS IN ITS </p><p>PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM, BEGUN IN 1998, IN 2002.  THE </p><p>GOJ SOLD ITS REMAINING 14.3% STAKE OF THE JORDAN </p><p>CEMENT FACTORIES COMPANY TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY </p><p>CORPORATION IN FEBRUARY 2002.  10.5% OF JORDAN </p><p>TELECOM SHARES WERE SOLD BY THE GOJ VIA AN INITIAL </p><p>PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) IN OCTOBER 2002.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SEEK A </p><p>STRATEGIC FOREIGN PARTNER TO BUY UP TO A 49 PERCENT </p><p>STAKE OF ROYAL JORDANIAN (RJ) AIRLINE\'S OPERATING </p><p>DIVISION.  RJ\'S ENGINE OVERHAUL FACILITY AND </p><p>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE DIVISION ARE FOR SALE; THE </p><p>FLIGHT TRAINING CENTER HAS BEEN SOLD IN PRIONCIPLE </p><p>TO BOEING, BUT THE TRANSACTION IS CURRENTLY ON </p><p>HOLD. </p><p> </p><p>IN 2002, THE GOVERNMENT BEGAN THE RESTRUCTURING OF </p><p>THE ELECTRICITY GENERATING AND DISTRIBUTION </p><p>COMPANIES (CEGCO, IDECO AND EDCO) AHEAD OF </p><p>PRIVATIZATION EXPECTED LATE 2003.  JORDAN HAS ALSO </p><p>ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO PRIVATIZE THE JORDAN </p><p>PHOSPHATE MINES COMPANY AND TO SELL A STAKE IN THE </p><p>ARAB POTASH COMPANY TO STRATEGIC PARTNERS.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING AN INTERNATIONAL INVESTOR TO </p><p>DEVELOP A 370 KM GAS-PIPELINE FROM AQABA TO ZARQA </p><p>ON A BOO BASIS.  THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS BEEN </p><p>TRANSFORMED INTO A PUBLIC SHAREHOLDING COMPANY </p><p>PENDING ITS EVENTUAL PRIVATIZATION. </p><p> </p><p>WHILE THESE EFFORTS HAVE COMBINED TO MAKE JORDAN\'S </p><p>INVESTMENT CLIMATE MORE WELCOMING, SOME LARGE U.S. </p><p>INVESTORS HAVE REPORTED THAT THERE WERE MANY </p><p>"HIDDEN COSTS" INVOLVED WHEN INVESTING IN JORDAN </p><p>DUE TO BUREAUCRACY, RED TAPE, VAGUE REGULATIONS AND </p><p>CONFLICTING JURISDICTIONS.  INVESTORS SHOULD </p><p>EXECUTE DUE DILIGENCE IN EXPLORING INVESTMENT </p><p>OPPORTUNITIES AND CONCLUDING PURCHASES. </p><p> </p><p>2. CONVERSION AND TRANSFER POLICIES </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN\'S LIBERAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE LAW ENTITLES </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTORS TO REMIT ABROAD, IN A FULLY </p><p>CONVERTIBLE FOREIGN CURRENCY, FOREIGN CAPITAL </p><p>INVESTED, INCLUDING ALL RETURNS, PROFITS, AND </p><p>PROCEEDS ARISING FROM THE LIQUIDATION OF INVESTMENT </p><p>PROJECTS.  NON-JORDANIAN ADMINISTRATIVE AND </p><p>TECHNICAL EMPLOYEES ARE PERMITTED TO TRANSFER THEIR </p><p>SALARIES AND COMPENSATION ABROAD. </p><p> </p><p>THE JORDANIAN DINAR IS FULLY CONVERTIBLE FOR ALL </p><p>COMMERCIAL AND CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS. THE JD IS </p><p>PEGGED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR AT AN EXCHANGE RATE OF </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 1 JD TO USD 1.41. </p><p> </p><p>LICENSED MONEY-EXCHANGERS ARE SUPERVISED BY THE </p><p>CENTRAL BANK, BUT ARE FREE TO SET THEIR OWN </p><p>EXCHANGE RATES DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. </p><p>UNLIKE BANKS, THEY DO NOT PAY THE CENTRAL BANK </p><p>COMMISSIONS FOR EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS, GIVING THEM </p><p>A COMPETITIVE EDGE OVER BANKS. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE REGULATIONS INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>--NON-RESIDENTS ARE ALLOWED TO OPEN BANK ACCOUNTS </p><p>IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.  THESE ACCOUNTS ARE EXEMPTED </p><p>FROM ALL TRANSFER-RELATED COMMISSION FEES CHARGED </p><p>BY THE CENTRAL BANK. </p><p> </p><p>-- BANKS ARE PERMITTED TO PURCHASE AN UNLIMITED </p><p>AMOUNT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FROM THEIR CLIENTS IN </p><p>EXCHANGE FOR JD ON A FORWARD BASIS.  BANKS ARE </p><p>PERMITTED TO ENGAGE IN REVERSE OPERATIONS INVOLVING </p><p>THE SELLING OF FOREIGN CURRENCY IN EXCHANGE FOR JD </p><p>ON A FORWARD DEAL BASIS FOR THE PURPOSE OF COVERING </p><p>THE VALUE OF IMPORTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF </p><p>FOREIGN CURRENCY THAT RESIDENTS MAY HOLD IN BANK </p><p>ACCOUNTS, AND THERE ARE NO CEILINGS ON THE AMOUNT </p><p>RESIDENTS ARE PERMITTED TO TRANSFER ABROAD. </p><p> </p><p>--BANKS DO NOT REQUIRE PRIOR CENTRAL BANK APPROVAL </p><p>FOR THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT- </p><p>RELATED TRANSFERS. </p><p> </p><p>3. EXPROPRIATION AND COMPENSATION </p><p> </p><p>THERE ARE NO KNOWN CASES WHERE THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>EXPROPRIATED THE PRIVATE PROPERTY OF AN INVESTOR. </p><p> </p><p>4. DISPUTE SETTLEMENT </p><p> </p><p>UNDER JORDANIAN LAW, FOREIGN INVESTORS MAY SEEK </p><p>THIRD PARTY ARBITRATION OR AN INTERNATIONALLY </p><p>RECOGNIZED SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES.  THE JORDANIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES DECISIONS ISSUED BY THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF </p><p>INVESTMENT DISPUTES (ICSID), OF WHICH IT IS A </p><p>MEMBER.  JORDAN IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK </p><p>CONVENTION OF 1958 ON THE RECOGNITION AND </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN ARBITRAL AWARDS.  IN CASES </p><p>WHERE THE GOVERNMENT (OR ITS AGENCIES) IS A PARTY </p><p>TO THE DISPUTE, IT GENERALLY PREFERS SETTLEMENT IN </p><p>LOCAL COURTS IF AN OUT-OF-COURT SETTLEMENT IS NOT </p><p>FORTHCOMING.  JORDAN ABIDES BY WTO DISPUTE </p><p>SETTLEMENT MECHANISMS.  DISPUTE SETTLEMENT </p><p>MECHANISMS UNDER THE FTA ARE CONSISTENT WITH WTO </p><p>COMMITMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>ARTICLE IX OF THE BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY </p><p>(BIT), SIGNED IN 1997, ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES FOR </p><p>DISPUTE SETTLEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>THERE IS CURRENTLY ONE OUTSTANDING DISPUTE BETWEEN </p><p>A U.S. INVESTOR AND THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT.  THE </p><p>DISPUTE IS CURRENTLY BEFORE AN ICSID TRIBUNAL AND </p><p>WITH A JORDANIAN APPELATE COURT. </p><p> </p><p>--JORDAN\'S LEGAL SYSTEM </p><p> </p><p>IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, DRAFT LAWS ARE PREPARED </p><p>BY VARIOUS MINISTRIES, WHICH ARE THEN SUBMITTED TO </p><p>THE CABINET AND SUBSEQUENTLY PRESENTED TO THE LOWER </p><p>HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT FOR CONSIDERATION. ONCE PASSED </p><p>BY THE LOWER HOUSE, DRAFT LAWS MUST BE APPROVED BY </p><p>THE SENATE.  ALL LAWS REQUIRE ROYAL ASSENT AND MUST </p><p>BE PUBLISHED IN THE NATIONAL GAZETTE BEFORE THEY </p><p>COME INTO FORCE. </p><p> </p><p>SINCE PARLIAMENT\'S DISSOLUTION IN MAY 2001, ALL </p><p>LAWS APPROVED BY THE CABINET AND GIVEN ROYAL </p><p>CONSENT ARE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY LAWS WHICH HAVE TO </p><p>BE SUBMITTED TO PARLIAMENT FOR DEBATE AND APPROVAL </p><p>ONCE IT RECONVENES.  PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS TOOK </p><p>PLACE IN JUNE 2003, AND PARLIAMENT RECONVENED IN </p><p>JULY 2003. </p><p> </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION, THE JUDICIARY IS </p><p>INDEPENDENT OF OTHER BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT. IN </p><p>SOME CASES, IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO POLITICAL PRESSURE </p><p>AND INTERFERENCE BY THE EXECUTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION CLASSIFIES THE JUDICIARY INTO </p><p>THREE CATEGORIES: RELIGIOUS COURTS, SPECIAL COURTS </p><p>(E.G. MILITARY COURT, CUSTOMS COURT, INCOME TAX </p><p>COURT) AND REGULAR COURTS.  VERDICTS RENDERED BY </p><p>THE JORDANIAN JUDICIARY ARE BASED ON DECISIONS MADE </p><p>BY A JUDGE OR A PANEL OF JUDGES. </p><p> </p><p>GENERAL LEGAL PROVISIONS ARE INCORPORATED WITHIN </p><p>THE CIVIL CODE, UNLESS A SEPARATE, MORE SPECIALIZED </p><p>LAW GOVERNS THE NATURE OF THE SPECIFIC </p><p>RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL CODE.  BUSINESS CONTRACTS, SUCH AS </p><p>COMMERCIAL AGENCY AND COMMISSION AGENCY CONTRACTS, </p><p>ARE SUBJECT TO THE CODE\'S PROVISIONS.  FINANCIAL </p><p>PAPERS SUCH AS CHECKS AND PROMISSORY NOTES ARE ALSO </p><p>DEALT WITH UNDER THE COMMERCIAL CODE. </p><p> </p><p>VARIOUS PROVISIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL CODE, THE </p><p>CIVIL CODE, AND THE COMPANIES LAW GOVERN BANKRUPTCY </p><p>AND INSOLVENCY.  A DRAFT BANKRUPTCY LAW HAS BEEN </p><p>APPROVED BY THE CABINET AND CAME INTO FORCE IN </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>5. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS/INCENTIVES </p><p> </p><p>FOLLOWING JORDAN\'S ACCESSION TO THE WTO, THE TRADE- </p><p>RELATED INVESTMENT MEASURES (TRIMS) AGREEMENT CAME </p><p>INTO FORCE.  INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL LAWS DO NOT </p><p>CONTAIN ANY TRADE-RESTRICTIVE INVESTMENT MEASURES </p><p>AND HAVE GENERALLY BEEN IN COMPLIANCE WITH TRIMS. </p><p> </p><p>INVESTMENT INCENTIVES TAKE THE FORM OF INCOME TAX </p><p>AND CUSTOM-DUTIES EXEMPTIONS, WHICH ARE GRANTED TO </p><p>BOTH JORDANIAN AND FOREIGN INVESTORS. </p><p> </p><p>THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED INTO THREE DEVELOPMENT </p><p>AREAS: ZONES A, B, AND C.  INVESTMENTS IN ZONE C, </p><p>THE LEAST DEVELOPED AREAS OF JORDAN, RECEIVE THE </p><p>HIGHEST LEVEL OF EXEMPTIONS. </p><p>HOWEVER, ALL AGRICULTURAL, MARITIME TRANSPORT, AND </p><p>RAILWAY INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS ZONE C, </p><p>IRRESPECTIVE OF LOCATION.  HOTEL AND TOURISM- </p><p>RELATED PROJECTS SET UP ALONG THE DEAD SEA COASTAL </p><p>AREA, LEISURE AND RECREATIONAL COMPOUNDS, AND </p><p>CONVENTION AND EXHIBITION CENTERS RECEIVE ZONE A </p><p>DESIGNATIONS.  QUALIFIED INDUSTRIAL ZONES (QIZS) </p><p>ARE CONSIDERED ZONE B PROJECTS UNLESS THEY FALL IN </p><p>ZONE C.  THE THREE-ZONE CLASSIFICATION SCHEME DOES </p><p>NOT APPLY TO NATURE RESERVES AND ENVIRONMENTAL </p><p>PROTECTION AREAS, WHICH ARE GRANTED SPECIAL </p><p>CONSIDERATION. </p><p> </p><p>SPECIFICALLY, THE INVESTMENT PROMOTION LAW ALLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-- EXEMPTIONS FROM INCOME AND SOCIAL SERVICES TAXES </p><p>OF UP TO TEN YEARS FOR PROJECTS APPROVED BY THE </p><p>INVESTMENT PROMOTION COMMITTEE (WHICH INCLUDES </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM THE MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND </p><p>TRADE, INCOME TAX DEPARTMENT, CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT, </p><p>THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE </p><p>JORDAN INVESTMENT BOARD), IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE </p><p>DESIGNATED ZONE SCHEME: </p><p> </p><p>         -- 25 PERCENT TAX EXEMPTION FOR ZONE A </p><p>         -- 50 PERCENT TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR ZONE B </p><p>         -- 75 PERCENT TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR ZONE C </p><p> </p><p>AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF THESE TAX EXEMPTIONS IS </p><p>GRANTED TO PROJECTS EACH TIME THEY UNDERGO </p><p>EXPANSION, MODERNIZATION, OR DEVELOPMENT RESULTING </p><p>IN A 25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THEIR PRODUCTION </p><p>CAPACITY FOR A MAXIMUM OF FOUR YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>-- CAPITAL GOODS ARE EXEMPT FROM DUTIES AND TAXES </p><p>IF DELIVERED WITHIN THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF </p><p>THE INVESTMENT PROMOTION COMMITTEE\'S APPROVAL.  THE </p><p>COMMITTEE MAY EXTEND THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD IF </p><p>NECESSARY. </p><p> </p><p>-- IMPORTED SPARE PARTS RELATED TO A SPECIFIC </p><p>PROJECT ARE EXEMPT FROM DUTIES AND TAXES, PROVIDED </p><p>THAT THEIR VALUE DOES NOT EXCEED 15 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>VALUE OF FIXED ASSETS REQUIRING SPARE PARTS.  THEY </p><p>SHOULD BE IMPORTED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE </p><p>PRODUCTION DATE. </p><p> </p><p>-- CAPITAL GOODS USED FOR EXPANSION AND </p><p>MODERNIZATION OF A PROJECT ARE EXEMPT FROM DUTIES </p><p>AND TAXES, PROVIDED THEY RESULT IN AT LEAST A 25 </p><p>PERCENT INCREASE IN PRODUCTION CAPACITY. </p><p> </p><p>-- HOTEL AND HOSPITAL PROJECTS RECEIVE EXEMPTIONS </p><p>FROM DUTIES AND TAXES ON FURNITURE AND SUPPLY </p><p>PURCHASES WHICH ARE REQUIRED FOR MODERNIZATION AND </p><p>RENEWAL ONCE EVERY SEVEN YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>-- INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF IMPORTED CAPITAL GOODS </p><p>ARE EXEMPT FROM DUTIES AND TAXES IF THE INCREASES </p><p>RESULT FROM HIGHER FREIGHT CHARGES OR CHANGES IN </p><p>THE EXCHANGE RATE. </p><p> </p><p>IN ADDITION TO THE INVESTMENT PROMOTION LAW, </p><p>ADDITIONAL EXEMPTIONS ARE GRANTED TO INVESTMENTS </p><p>WITHIN INDUSTRIAL ESTATES DESIGNATED AS SPECIAL </p><p>INDUSTRIAL ZONES: </p><p> </p><p>-- INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS ARE GRANTED EXEMPTIONS ON </p><p>INCOME AND SOCIAL SERVICES TAXES FOR A TWO-YEAR </p><p>PERIOD.  ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES THAT </p><p>RELOCATE TO AN INDUSTRIAL ESTATE ALSO RECEIVE THIS </p><p>BENEFIT. </p><p> </p><p>-- INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS ARE GRANTED PROPERTY TAX </p><p>EXEMPTIONS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIME. </p><p> </p><p>-- INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS ARE GRANTED PARTIAL OR FULL </p><p>EXEMPTIONS FROM MOST MUNICIPALITY AND PLANNING </p><p>FEES. </p><p> </p><p>TO PROMOTE EXPORTS, ALL EXPORTERS ARE GRANTED THE </p><p>FOLLOWING INCENTIVES: </p><p> </p><p>-- NET PROFITS GENERATED FROM MOST EXPORT REVENUES </p><p>ARE FULLY EXEMPT FROM INCOME TAX.  EXCEPTIONS </p><p>INCLUDE FERTILIZER, PHOSPHATE, AND POTASH EXPORTS, </p><p>IN ADDITION TO EXPORTS GOVERNED BY SPECIFIC TRADE </p><p>PROTOCOLS AND FOREIGN DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEMES. UNDER </p><p>THE WTO SUCH EXEMPTIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PHASED </p><p>OUT BY THE END OF 2002, BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS </p><p>SEEKING A TWO-YEAR EXTENSION. </p><p>-- FOREIGN INPUTS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF EXPORTS </p><p>ARE EXEMPT FROM CUSTOM DUTIES AND ALL ADDITIONAL </p><p>IMPORT FEES ON A REIMBURSABLE OR DRAWBACK BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTORS CAN BID FOR GOVERNMENT- </p><p>COMMISSIONED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT </p><p>ARE SLATED FOR INTERNATIONAL OR MIXED BIDDERS. </p><p>OTHERWISE, THEY HAVE TO FIND A JORDANIAN PARTNER. </p><p>THIS QUALIFICATION WILL BE DROPPED ONCE JORDAN </p><p>ACCEDES TO THE WTO\'S GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT </p><p>AGREEMENT (GPA), FOR WHICH IT IS CURRENTLY </p><p>PREPARING AN ENTITIES OFFER. </p><p> </p><p>6. RIGHT TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP AND ESTABLISHMENT </p><p> </p><p>IN GENERAL, THE LAWS ON INVESTMENT AND PROPERTY </p><p>OWNERSHIP PERMIT DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN ENTITIES TO </p><p>ESTABLISH AND OWN BUSINESSES AND ENGAGE IN </p><p>REMUNERATIVE ACTIVITIES.  HOWEVER, ACTIVITIES </p><p>RELEVANT TO MILITARY AND NATIONAL SECURITY ARE </p><p>SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT PROVISIONS AND PROCEDURES. </p><p> </p><p>FOREIGN COMPANIES MAY OPEN REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>(REGIONAL) AND BRANCH OFFICES; BRANCH OFFICES MAY </p><p>CARRY OUT FULL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WHILE REGIONAL </p><p>OFFICES MAY SERVE AS LIAISONS BETWEEN HEAD OFFICES </p><p>AND JORDANIAN OR REGIONAL CLIENTS.  THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>INDUSTRY AND TRADE MANAGES THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY </p><p>ON SETTING UP REGIONAL AND BRANCH OFFICES. </p><p> </p><p>NO FOREIGN FIRM MAY IMPORT GOODS WITHOUT APPOINTING </p><p>AN AGENT REGISTERED IN JORDAN.  THE AGENT\'S </p><p>CONNECTION TO THE FOREIGN COMPANY MUST BE DIRECT, </p><p>WITHOUT A SUB-AGENT OR INTERMEDIARY.  IN MID 2001, </p><p>A COMMERCIAL AGENTS AND INTERMEDIARIES LAW WAS </p><p>PASSED TO GOVERN THE CONTRACT BETWEEN FOREIGN FIRMS </p><p>AND COMMERCIAL AGENTS.  IT CLEARLY DELINEATES THE </p><p>DISTINCTION BETWEEN COMMERCIAL AGENCY AND </p><p>DISTRIBUTION CONTRACTS RELATIONSHIPS.  PRIVATE </p><p>FOREIGN ENTITIES, WHETHER LICENSED UNDER SOLE </p><p>FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OR AS A JOINT VENTURE, COMPETE ON </p><p>AN EQUAL BASIS WITH LOCAL COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>NON-ARAB FOREIGN NATIONALS ARE PERMITTED TO OWN OR </p><p>LEASE PROPERTY IN JORDAN, PROVIDED THAT THEIR HOME </p><p>COUNTRY DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST JORDANIANS </p><p>AND THE PROPERTY IS DEVELOPED WITHIN FIVE YEARS </p><p>FROM THE DATE OF APPROVAL.  THE CABINET IS THE </p><p>AUTHORITY ON LICENSING FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF LAND </p><p>AND PROPERTY.  AGRICULTURAL LAND IS NOT INCLUDED IN </p><p>THE PROVISIONS OF THIS LAW.  HOWEVER, A FOREIGN </p><p>COMPANY THAT INVESTS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN </p><p>JORDAN AUTOMATICALLY OBTAINS NATIONAL TREATMENT </p><p>WITH RESPECT TO OWNERSHIP OF AGRICULTURAL LAND, </p><p>ONCE REGISTERED AS A JORDANIAN COMPANY. </p><p> </p><p>7. PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p>INTEREST IN PROPERTY (MOVEABLE AND REAL) IS </p><p>RECOGNIZED, ENFORCED AND RECORDED THROUGH RELIABLE </p><p>LEGAL PROCESSES.  THE LEGAL SYSTEM FACILITATES AND </p><p>PROTECTS THE ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION OF ALL </p><p>PROPERTY RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>PRIOR TO ITS ACCESSION TO THE WTO, JORDAN PASSED </p><p>SEVERAL NEW LAWS TO IMPROVE PROTECTION OF </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR), PATENTS, </p><p>COPYRIGHTS, AND TRADEMARKS.    TRIPS (TRADE RELATED </p><p>ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS)-CONSISTENT </p><p>LAWS NOW PROTECT TRADE SECRETS, PLANT VARIETIES AND </p><p>SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP DESIGNS.  THE LAW REQUIRES </p><p>REGISTRATION OF COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS. </p><p>COPYRIGHTS MUST BE REGISTERED AT THE NATIONAL </p><p>LIBRARY, PART OF THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE.  PATENTS </p><p>MUST BE REGISTERED WITH THE REGISTRAR OF PATENTS </p><p>AND TRADEMARKS AT THE MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND </p><p>TRADE. </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN\'S PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY GENERALLY ABIDES </p><p>BY THE NEW TRIPS-CONSISTENT PATENT LAW.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, IN SIGNING THE FTA JORDAN COMMITTED TO </p><p>EVEN STRONGER ENFORCEMENT OF IPR, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>THE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR.  IT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO </p><p>ACCEDE TO THE WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY </p><p>ORGANIZATION (WIPO) TREATIES ON COPYRIGHTS (WCT) </p><p>AND PERFORMANCES AND PHONOGRAPHS (WPPT) BY THE END </p><p>OF 2002.  JORDANIAN FIRMS ARE NOW SEEKING JOINT </p><p>VENTURES AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH </p><p>MULTINATIONAL PARTNERS. </p><p>JORDAN\'S RECORD ON IPR ENFORCEMENT HAS IMPROVED. </p><p>HOWEVER, EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS AND LEGAL </p><p>PROCEDURES ARE YET TO BE FULLY ESTABLISHED.  AS A </p><p>RESULT, THE GOVERNMENT\'S RECORD ON IPR PROTECTION </p><p>REMAINS MIXED.  A SIZEABLE PROPORTION OF VIDEOS AND </p><p>SOFTWARE SOLD IN THE MARKETPLACE CONTINUES TO BE </p><p>PIRATED.  ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST AUDIO/VIDEO </p><p>AND SOFTWARE PIRACY IS IMPROVING, BUT REMAINS </p><p>SPOTTY. </p><p> </p><p>8. TRANSPARENCY OF THE REGULATORY SYSTEM </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT IS SLOWLY IMPLEMENTING POLICIES TO </p><p>IMPROVE COMPETITION AND FOSTER TRANSPARENCY.  THESE </p><p>REFORMS AIM TO CHANGE AN EXISTING SYSTEM THAT CAN </p><p>BE INFLUENCED GREATLY BY FAMILY AFFILIATIONS AND </p><p>BUSINESS TIES.  ALTHOUGH IN MANY INSTANCES </p><p>BUREAUCRATIC PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN STREAMLINED, RED </p><p>TAPE AND OPAQUE PROCEDURES STILL PRESENT PROBLEMS </p><p>FOR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INVESTORS.  THE ARBITRARY </p><p>APPLICATION OF CUSTOMS, TAX, LABOR, HEALTH AND </p><p>OTHER LAWS OR REGULATIONS, PARTICULARLY AT THE </p><p>LEVEL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, HAVE IMPEDED INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IN 2002, THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUED ITS AGGRESSIVE </p><p>STRATEGY TO PROMOTE E-GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAS PLEDGED TO MAKE ITS SERVICES, REGULATIONS, AND </p><p>PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES MORE ACCESSIBLE AND </p><p>TRANSPARENT VIA E-GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>9. EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS AND PORTFOLIO </p><p>INVESTMENT </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN\'S CAPITAL MARKET IS SMALL, WITH A </p><p>CAPITALIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY USD 7 BILLION </p><p>(AROUND 80 PERCENT OF GDP).  MAJOR RESTRUCTURING OF </p><p>THE MARKET WAS COMPLETED IN 2000. </p><p> </p><p>THE AMMAN FINANCIAL MARKET (AFM) IS DIVIDED AMONG </p><p>THE JORDAN SECURITIES COMMISSION (JSC), THE AMMAN </p><p>STOCK EXCHANGE (ASE) AND THE SECURITIES DEPOSITORY </p><p>CENTER (SDC).  THE SDC IS THE CUSTODIAN FOR ALL </p><p>TRANSACTION CONTRACTS, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT. </p><p>THE JSC WAS ESTABLISHED AS THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>SUPERVISORY AND MONITORING AGENCY FOR THE CAPITAL </p><p>MARKET IN JORDAN.  THE GOVERNMENT IS WORKING ON </p><p>FURTHER AMENDMENTS TO THE SECURITIES LAW THAT WILL </p><p>BRING IT MORE IN LINE WITH INTERNATIONAL BEST </p><p>PRACTICES. </p><p> </p><p>THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 24 BROKERAGE FIRMS AND 158 </p><p>LISTED PUBLIC-SHAREHOLDING COMPANIES ON THE ASE. </p><p>THIRTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF OWNERSHIP IS BY NON- </p><p>JORDANIAN, MOSTLY ARAB, INVESTORS. DESPITE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, MORE </p><p>REFORM IS NEEDED TO ESTABLISH A MARKET WITH </p><p>ADEQUATE LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND BEST PRACTICES </p><p>NORMS. </p><p> </p><p>THE ASE ALSO SUFFERS FROM INTERMITTENT LIQUIDITY </p><p>PROBLEMS, WHICH HAVE ENSURED THAT THE BOURSE </p><p>REMAINS PRONE TO SPECULATIVE MOVEMENTS.  STRUCTURAL </p><p>PROBLEMS (SUCH AS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND </p><p>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE DEARTH OF MUTUAL </p><p>FUNDS) HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE INSUFFICIENCY </p><p>OF INSTITUTIONAL BUYING AND WAVERING INVESTOR </p><p>CONFIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>THE CENTRAL BANK, ON BEHALF OF THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>FINANCE, CONDUCTS REGULAR AUCTIONS OF SIX-MONTH </p><p>TREASURY BILLS AND THREE-YEAR TREASURY BONDS. </p><p>TREASURY BONDS AND BILLS AND DEVELOPMENT BONDS </p><p>(EQUIVALENT TO TREASURY BONDS) ARE LISTED ON THE </p><p>ASE.  MONTHLY TRADING VOLUME AVERAGES JD 600,000 </p><p>(USD 840,000) AT FACE VALUE.  DESPITE THIS LOW </p><p>VOLUME, MARKETS ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED ON DEVELOPMENT </p><p>BONDS EACH TRADING DAY.  THESE QUOTES PROVIDE THE </p><p>BASIS FOR THE BENCHMARK YIELD CURVE PUBLISHED DAILY </p><p>ON THE CENTRAL BANK REUTERS PAGES AND IN THE LOCAL </p><p>ARABIC NEWSPAPERS.  THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE WILL BE </p><p>ISSUING BONDS OF DIFFERING MATURITIES LATER IN </p><p>2002, LENGTHENING THE YIELD CURVE.  THE CENTRAL </p><p>BANK ALSO INTRODUCED A PRIMARY DEALER PLAN DESIGNED </p><p>TO INCREASE LIQUIDITY IN THE SECONDARY MARKET.  A </p><p>NEW PUBLIC DEBT LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR AN INCREASE IN </p><p>THE VOLUME OF BOND AND BILL ISSUANCE BY THE </p><p>TREASURY CAME INTO FORCE IN SUMMER 2001. </p><p>GOVERNMENT BOND AND BILL OWNERSHIP IS STILL </p><p>REGISTERED IN BOOK-ENTRY FORM AT THE CENTRAL BANK, </p><p>BUT IT WILL BE HANDLED BY THE SDC SOMETIME IN 2003. </p><p>COMMERCIAL BANKS MAINTAIN SUB-REGISTRIES.  FOREIGN </p><p>INVESTORS ARE WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE IN AUCTIONS </p><p>AND TO PURCHASE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. </p><p> </p><p>THE CORPORATE BOND MARKET REMAINS UNDER-DEVELOPED, </p><p>AND CONTINUES TO BE OVER-SHADOWED BY TRADITIONAL </p><p>DIRECT LENDING. ONE REASON IS RIGID INTEREST RATES; </p><p>ANOTHER RELATES TO THE ABSENCE OF A SECONDARY </p><p>MARKET FOR SUCH ISSUES.  INCREASINGLY, HOWEVER, </p><p>SOME BANKS HAVE STARTED INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS </p><p>AND CORPORATE BOND ISSUES.  THE LATTER AMOUNTED TO </p><p>JD 69.8 MILLION (USD 98 MILLION) IN 2002. </p><p>ONE FLAW IN THE CREDIT MARKET IS THE LACK OF LONG- </p><p>TERM CREDIT, OWING TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF </p><p>BANKS\' DEPOSIT STRUCTURE.  ON AVERAGE, REGULAR </p><p>CORPORATE LOANS ARE EXTENDED FOR PERIODS OF 1-3 </p><p>YEARS, WHILE SYNDICATED LOANS MAY REACH UP TO 7 </p><p>YEARS.  LONG-TERM FINANCING HAS ALSO BEEN LONG </p><p>CURTAILED BY THE OTTOMAN-ERA LAW THAT STIPULATED </p><p>THAT TOTAL INTEREST PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF A </p><p>BOND MAY NOT BE GREATER THAN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. </p><p>THIS EFFECTIVELY IMPEDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONGER- </p><p>MATURITY FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS, EVEN THOUGH IT </p><p>WAS NOT EFFECTIVELY ENFORCED.  THE PUBLIC DEBT LAW </p><p>HAS SCRAPPED THIS REQUIREMENT, ALLOWING FOR LONGER </p><p>MATURITIES AND INCREASED VOLUMES. </p><p> </p><p>THE ABSENCE OF LONG-TERM CREDIT DISCOURAGES </p><p>PROJECTS REQUIRING LONG DEVELOPMENT PERIODS.  AS A </p><p>CONSEQUENCE, LARGE INVESTMENT PROJECTS OFTEN RESORT </p><p>TO FOREIGN MARKETS TO RAISE CAPITAL. </p><p> </p><p>THE CENTRAL BANK OF JORDAN (CBJ) IS THE BANKING </p><p>SYSTEM\'S REGULATORY AUTHORITY. AN ECONOMIC SLOW- </p><p>DOWN SINCE 1996 HAS TAKEN A TOLL ON JORDANIAN </p><p>BANKS, AND UNOFFICIAL ESTIMATES OF NON-PERFORMING </p><p>LOANS PUT THE TOTAL AT AROUND 30 PERCENT OF ALL </p><p>LOANS. </p><p> </p><p>A BANKING LAW, WHICH AIMS AT IMPROVING THE </p><p>INDUSTRY\'S EFFICIENCY, CAME INTO FORCE IN 2000. </p><p>THE NEW LAW PROTECTS DEPOSITORS\' INTERESTS, </p><p>DIMINISHES MONEY MARKET RISK, GUARDS AGAINST THE </p><p>CONCENTRATION OF LENDING, AND INCLUDES ARTICLES ON </p><p>NEW BANKING PRACTICES (E-COMMERCE AND E-BANKING) </p><p>AND MONEY LAUNDERING.  THE CBJ HAS ISSUED A NUMBER </p><p>OF CIRCULARS THROUGHOUT THE PAST YEAR TO IMPLEMENT </p><p>MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT </p><p>WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE OECD\'S FINANCIAL </p><p>ACTION TASK FORCE.  IT ALSO ALLOWS MARKET FORCES </p><p>GREATER INFLUENCE TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF </p><p>FINANCIAL MARKETS.  IN ADDITION, THE CBJ SET UP A </p><p>SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT DEPOSIT INSURANCE </p><p>CORPORATION IN LATE 2000, THAT ENSURES DEPOSITS OF </p><p>UP TO JD 10,000 (USD 14,000).  THE CORPORATION ALSO </p><p>ACTS AS THE LIQUIDATOR OF BANKS AS DIRECTED BY THE </p><p>CBJ. </p><p> </p><p>THE CBJ ESTABLISHED A CREDIT BUREAU FOR BOUNCED </p><p>CHECKS IN 2001.  THE BUREAU REQUIRES BANKS TO </p><p>REPORT ON A TIMELY BASIS THE NAMES OF ACCOUNT </p><p>HOLDERS WITH BOUNCED CHECKS.  FOLLOWING A THIRD </p><p>REPORT OF A BOUNCED CHECK, THE CBJ CIRCULATES THE </p><p>NAMES OF THE ACCOUNT HOLDERS TO ALL BANKS WITH </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS TO WITHHOLD CHECK-BOOKS AND ANY OTHER </p><p>FACILITIES FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME. </p><p> </p><p>AS OF THE END OF 2002, THE ARAB BANK AND THE </p><p>HOUSING BANK WERE THE TWO LARGEST BANKS IN JORDAN, </p><p>WITH ASSET BASES OF JD 19.3 BILLION (USD 27 </p><p>BILLION) AND JD 1.7 BILLION (USD 2.4 BILLION), </p><p>RESPECTIVELY.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR ASSET </p><p>BASES OWES TO THE VAST DIFFERENCE IN THEIR SCOPE OF </p><p>OPERATIONS; THE ARAB BANK HAS A WORLDWIDE PRESENCE, </p><p>WHILE THE HOUSING BANK\'S PRIME FOCUS IS THE LOCAL </p><p>MARKET.  ALTHOUGH THE CENTRAL BANK DISTINGUISHES </p><p>BETWEEN "INVESTMENT BANKS" AND "COMMERCIAL BANKS", </p><p>THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE </p><p>OPERATIONS OF THE TWO. </p><p> </p><p>BANKS OFFER LOANS, DISCOUNTED BILLS, AND OVERDRAFT </p><p>FACILITIES. INVESTMENT BANKS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO </p><p>EXTEND OVERDRAFT FACILITIES.  THE CENTRAL BANK </p><p>PERMITS BANKS TO EXTEND LOANS AND CREDIT FACILITIES </p><p>IN FOREIGN CURRENCY.  IN SUCH CASES, IT REQUIRES </p><p>DEBT REPAYMENT TO BE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY. </p><p> </p><p>A NUMBER OF BANKS HAVE ESTABLISHED MUTUAL FUNDS. </p><p>NEW CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER </p><p>AND CONVERTIBLE BONDS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION.  IN </p><p>ADDITION TO LONG-TERM INSTRUMENTS, SECURITIZATION, </p><p>SHORT-SELLING, AND TREASURY STOCKS ARE BEING </p><p>INTRODUCED IN SOME BANKS. </p><p> </p><p>A BANKING SCANDAL THAT REPORTEDLY INVOLVED </p><p>FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY AND EMBEZZLEMENT OF SOME USD </p><p>120 MILLION EMERGED IN FEBRUARY 2002 AND INVOLVED </p><p>SOME PROMINENT JORDANIANS AND LOANS DRAWN FROM </p><p>THREE BANKS.  HOWEVER, THE CENTRAL BANK TOOK </p><p>ADEQUATE ACTION TO REASSURE DEPOSITORS AND RESTORE </p><p>CALM TO THE MARKET.  IN ADDITION, THE SECTOR DID </p><p>NOT SUFFER ANY SIGNIFICANT SHOCKS DURING GULF WAR </p><p>II, EITHER DUE TO SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO TRADE </p><p>WITH IRAQ OR TO RUNS ON BANK DEPOSITS AT THE </p><p>OUTBREAK OF THE CONFLICT.  AS A RESULT, THE HEALTH </p><p>OF THE BANKING SYSTEM AND ITS RESILIENCE ARE NOT IN </p><p>QUESTION.  IRAQI GOVERNMENT ASSETS IN JORDANIAN </p><p>BANKS WERE FROZEN IN EARLY 2003. </p><p> </p><p>WITH RESPECT TO OWNERSHIP AND PARTICIPATION IN THE </p><p>MAJOR ECONOMIC SECTORS IN JORDAN, THERE IS NO </p><p>APPARENT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FOREIGN </p><p>PARTICIPATION.  IN FACT, MANY JORDANIAN BUSINESSES </p><p>SEEK FOREIGN PARTNERS, WHICH ARE PERCEIVED AS THE </p><p>KEY TO INCREASED COMPETITIVENESS AND EASIER ENTRY </p><p>INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. </p><p> </p><p>THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED </p><p>ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING FIRMS IN JORDAN.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING REGULATIONS </p><p>ARE CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND ARE </p><p>INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED. </p><p> </p><p>10. POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>SOME INCIDENTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND TERRORIST </p><p>ACTIVITIES HAVE OCCURRED IN JORDAN RECENTLY, THOUGH </p><p>THESE HAVE NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED FOREIGN BUSINESS </p><p>INTERESTS.  WHILE JORDAN ENJOYS POLITICAL </p><p>STABILITY, EVENTS IN THE REGION, PARTICULARLY IN </p><p>THE WEST BANK AND GAZA, CAN TRIGGER SMALL </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS AND ANTI-U.S. HOSTILITY. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN IS PROACTIVE IN </p><p>MAINTAINING PUBLIC SECURITY, CONTAINING </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS AND PREVENTING TERRORIST ATTACKS. </p><p>THE POTENTIAL FOR POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED VIOLENCE, </p><p>HOWEVER, REMAINS.  VISITORS SHOULD CONSULT CURRENT </p><p>STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>11. CORRUPTION </p><p> </p><p>CORRUPTION IS A CRIME IN JORDAN.  THE GENERAL </p><p>INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE (GID) HAS AN ANTI- </p><p>CORRUPTION DEPARTMENT THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR </p><p>COMBATING BRIBERY, EXTORTION, AND OTHER SIMILAR </p><p>CRIMES. </p><p> </p><p>INFLUENCE PEDDLING AND A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY HAVE </p><p>BEEN ALLEGED IN GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT AND DISPUTE </p><p>SETTLEMENT. "WASTA", THE USE OF FAMILY, BUSINESS, </p><p>AND OTHER PERSONAL CONNECTIONS TO ADVANCE BUSINESS </p><p>AND INTERESTS, IS ENDEMIC. </p><p> </p><p>12. BILATERAL TRADE/INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS </p><p> </p><p>A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (FTA) BETWEEN THE U.S. AND </p><p>JORDAN ENTERED INTO FORCE IN DECEMBER 2001.  THE </p><p>AGREEMENT MANDATES THAT A FREE TRADE AREA BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO COUNTRIES WILL BE ATTAINED FOLLOWING A </p><p>GRADUAL PHASING OUT OF IMPORT DUTIES AND OTHER </p><p>TRADE BARRIERS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.  THE </p><p>AGREEMENT INCORPORATES LABOR, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PROVISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>THE U.S. AND JORDAN SIGNED A BILATERAL INVESTMENT </p><p>TREATY IN 1997.  THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES RECIPROCAL </p><p>PROTECTION OF JORDANIAN AND U.S. INDIVIDUAL AND </p><p>CORPORATE INVESTMENTS AND ENTERED INTO FORCE IN </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN SIGNED THE TRADE AND INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK </p><p>AGREEMENT (TIFA) IN 1999.  UNDER THE TIFA, A U.S.- </p><p>JORDAN COUNCIL ON TRADE AND INVESTMENT WAS </p><p>ESTABLISHED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF WORKING TOWARDS </p><p>THE REMOVAL OF IMPEDIMENTS TO TRADE AND INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN IS A MEMBER OF A PAN-ARAB ACCORD ON </p><p>FACILITATING THE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL BETWEEN ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES.  COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SIGNED THE ACCORD </p><p>INCLUDE JORDAN, UAE, BAHRAIN, TUNISIA, SAUDI </p><p>ARABIA, IRAQ, OMAN, KUWAIT, LIBYA, EGYPT, MOROCCO, </p><p>QATAR, SYRIA, AND LEBANON. </p><p> </p><p>AN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN JORDAN </p><p>AND THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT ESTABLISHES FREE TRADE </p><p>OVER A TWELVE-YEAR PERIOD ENTERED INTO FORCE IN </p><p>2002.  THIS AGREEMENT CALLS FOR THE FREE MOVEMENT </p><p>OF CAPITAL, AS WELL AS COOPERATION ON DEVELOPMENT </p><p>AND POLITICAL ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>13. OPIC AND OTHER INVESTMENT INSURANCE PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p>INVESTMENTS IN JORDAN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR OVERSEAS </p><p>PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION (OPIC) INSURANCE AND </p><p>PRIVATE FINANCING. </p><p> </p><p>IN ADDITION, THERE ARE TWO OPIC-BACKED INVESTMENT </p><p>FUNDS THAT MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN BUSINESSES IN </p><p>JORDAN, THE WEST BANK/GAZA, AND OMAN.  THE WEST </p><p>BANK/GAZA AND JORDAN EMERGING FUND, WITH A TARGET </p><p>CAPITAL OF USD 60 MILLION, EXPECTS TO MAKE 40 </p><p>PERCENT OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN JORDAN.  IT IS </p><p>MANAGED BY INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL ADVISORS OF </p><p>VIENNA, VIRGINIA.  THE OTHER FUND IS THE INTERARAB </p><p>INVESTMENT FUND, MANAGED BY INTERARAB MANAGEMENT OF </p><p>PORTOLA VALLEY CALIFORNIA, WHICH EXPECTS TO INVEST </p><p>ONE-THIRD OF ITS USD 45 MILLION TARGET CAPITAL IN </p><p>JORDAN. </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE MULTILATERAL </p><p>INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY (MIGA), A WORLD BANK </p><p>AGENCY, WHICH GUARANTEES INVESTMENT AGAINST NON- </p><p>COMMERCIAL RISKS SUCH AS CIVIL WAR, </p><p>NATIONALIZATION, POLICY CHANGES, ETC.  THE PROGRAM </p><p>COVERS INVESTMENTS IN JORDAN IRRESPECTIVE OF THE </p><p>INVESTORS NATIONALITY, IN ADDITION TO COVERING </p><p>JORDANIAN INVESTMENTS ABROAD. </p><p> </p><p>SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE OFFICIAL DEBT-FOR- </p><p>EQUITY SWAP PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPEN TO INVESTORS OF </p><p>ALL NATIONALITIES. </p><p> </p><p>14. LABOR </p><p> </p><p>THE RATE OF POPULATION GROWTH (BIRTHS MINUS DEATHS) </p><p>IS ABOUT 2.4 PERCENT A YEAR.  ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF </p><p>THE POPULATION IS UNDER THE AGE OF 30.  IN GENERAL, </p><p>THE LABOR FORCE IS WELL EDUCATED.  LITERACY RATES </p><p>APPROACH 94.5 PERCENT FOR MEN AND 83.5 PERCENT FOR </p><p>WOMEN.  JORDAN HAS A LABOR FORCE OF 1.17 MILLION </p><p>AND A GOVERNMENT-ESTIMATED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 1 </p><p>PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>THE OFFICIALLY ESTIMATED 140,000 FOREIGN LABORERS </p><p>IN JORDAN WORK PRIMARILY IN UNSKILLED SECTORS, SUCH </p><p>AS CONSTRUCTION, AGRICULTURE, AND DOMESTIC SERVICE. </p><p>THEY CONSTITUTE AROUND 12 PERCENT OF THE LABOR </p><p>FORCE.  THE MINISTRY OF LABOR REGULATES FOREIGN </p><p>WORKER LICENSING, LICENSING FEES, PROHIBITED </p><p>SECTORS, AND EMPLOYER LIABILITY.  AMONG ITS </p><p>RESPONSIBILITES, THE MINISTRY APPROVES THE HIRING </p><p>OF PROFESSIONAL FOREIGN WORKERS BY PRIVATE </p><p>BUSINESSES. NON-CITIZENS ARE NOT PERMITTED BY LAW </p><p>TO JOIN UNIONS. </p><p> </p><p>LABOR UNIONS SERVE PRIMARILY AS INTERMEDIARIES </p><p>BETWEEN WORKERS AND THE MINISTRY OF LABOR, AND MAY </p><p>ENGAGE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ON BEHALF OF </p><p>WORKERS.  IN ORDER TO STRIKE, WORKERS MUST OBTAIN </p><p>PERMISSION FROM THE GOVERNMENT.  CURRENTLY, ABOUT </p><p>30 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL LABOR FORCE, INCLUDING </p><p>GOVERNMENT SERVICE, IS UNIONIZED.  HOWEVER, THIS </p><p>FIGURE INCLUDES NUMEROUS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS </p><p>WHERE MEMBERSHIP IS MANDATORY. </p><p> </p><p>ARTICLE 28 OF THE LABOR LAW SPECIFIES THE </p><p>CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH AN EMPLOYER CAN DISCHARGE A </p><p>WORKER WITHOUT NOTICE.  ARTICLE 31 ALLOWS EMPLOYERS </p><p>TO LAY OFF EMPLOYEES IF ECONOMIC OR TECHNICAL </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES NECESSITATE REORGANIZATION.  THE LAW </p><p>DOES NOT REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO INCLUDE RETIREMENT </p><p>PLANS IN THEIR EMPLOYMENT PACKAGE.  HOWEVER, IF THE </p><p>EMPLOYER AGREED TO PROVIDE RETIREMENT BENEFITS WHEN </p><p>THE WORKER WAS CONTRACTED, THE EMPLOYER MUST </p><p>FULFILL HIS/HER COMMITMENT.  THE SOCIAL SECURITY </p><p>LAW STIPULATES THAT IF THE EMPLOYER HAS MORE THAN </p><p>FIVE EMPLOYEES, THEY MUST BE ENROLLED IN THE SOCIAL </p><p>SECURITY SYSTEM.  THE LABOR LAW ALSO ADDRESSES </p><p>WORKER COMPENSATION AND OUTLINES COMPENSATORY </p><p>CATEGORIES FOR WORK-RELATED INJURIES.  ARTICLE 67 </p><p>PROVIDES UNPAID MATERNITY LEAVE FOR A MAXIMUM OF </p><p>ONE YEAR FOR MOTHERS WORKING IN FIRMS EMPLOYING 10 </p><p>OR MORE WORKERS, AND ARTICLE 70 REQUIRES FULL PAY </p><p>FOR 10 WEEKS OF MATERNITY LEAVE.  THE LAW PROVIDES </p><p>FOR 14 DAYS OF ANNUAL LEAVE FOR EMPLOYEES DURING </p><p>THE FIRST FIVE YEARS WITH THE EMPLOYER, AND 21 DAYS </p><p>AFTER FIVE YEARS OF SUCCESSIVE SERVICE.  THIS LAW </p><p>PLACES JORDAN IN COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL AND </p><p>ARAB LABOR AGREEMENTS. </p><p> </p><p>15. FOREIGN TRADE ZONES/FREE PORTS </p><p> </p><p>THE ZARQA FREE ZONE IS JORDAN\'S MAJOR FREE ZONE </p><p>AREA.  OTHER AREAS INCLUDE THE SAHAB INDUSTRIAL </p><p>ESTATE FREE ZOONE, QUEEN ALIA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT </p><p>FREE ZONE, AND THE GATEWAY QUALIFYING INDUSTRIAL </p><p>ZONE. </p><p> </p><p>IN MAY 2001, THE GOVERNMENT CONVERTED THE AQABA </p><p>PORT AND SURROUNDING AREA INTO A SPECIAL ECONOMIC </p><p>ZONE (SEZ) WITH STREAMLINED BURAEUCRACY, LOWER </p><p>TAXES, AND FACILITATED CUSTOMS HANDLING. </p><p> </p><p>BOTH JORDANIAN AND FOREIGN INVESTORS ARE PERMITTED </p><p>TO INVEST IN TRADE, SERVICES, AND INDUSTRIAL </p><p>PROJECTS IN FREE ZONES.  INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS MUST </p><p>FULFILL ONE OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: </p><p> </p><p>-- NEW INDUSTRIES WHICH DEPEND ON ADVANCED </p><p>TECHNOLOGY; </p><p> </p><p>-- INDUSTRIES REQUIRING RAW MATERIAL AND/OR LOCALLY </p><p>MANUFACTURED PARTS THAT ARE LOCALLY AVAILABLE; </p><p> </p><p>-- INDUSTRIES THAT COMPLEMENT DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES; </p><p> </p><p>-- INDUSTRIES THAT ENHANCE LABOR SKILLS AND PROMOTE </p><p>TECHNICAL KNOW-HOW; </p><p> </p><p>-- INDUSTRIES PROVIDING CONSUMER GOODS, AND THAT </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING MARKET DEPENDENCY ON </p><p>IMPORTED GOODS; </p><p> </p><p>THE FOLLOWING INCENTIVES ARE GRANTED TO INVESTORS </p><p>IN THE DESIGNATED FREE ZONES: </p><p> </p><p>-- PROFITS ARE EXEMPT FROM INCOME AND SOCIAL </p><p>SERVICES TAXES FOR A PERIOD OF TWELVE YEARS, WITH </p><p>THE EXCEPTION OF PROFITS GENERATED FROM STORAGE </p><p>SERVICES THAT INVOLVE GOODS RELEASED TO THE </p><p>DOMESTIC MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>-- SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES PAYABLE NON-JORDANIAN </p><p>EMPLOYEES ARE EXMEPT FROM INCOME AND SOCIAL </p><p>SERVICES TAXES. </p><p> </p><p>-- GOODS IMPORTED TO AND/OR EXPORTED FROM FREE </p><p>ZONES ARE EXEMPT FROM IMPORT TAXES AND CUSTOMS </p><p>DUTIES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GOODS RELEASED TO THE </p><p>DOMESTIC MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>-- INDUSTRIAL GOODS MANUFACTURED IN FREE ZONES </p><p>ENJOY PARTIAL CUSTOMS DUTIES EXEMPTION ONCE </p><p>RELEASED TO THE DOMESTIC MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE </p><p>PROPORTION OF THE VALUE OF LOCAL INPUTS AND LOCALLY </p><p>INCURRED PRODUCTION COSTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE EXEMPT FROM LICENSING </p><p>FEES AND URBAN PROPERTY TAXES. </p><p>-- FREE TRANSFER OF CAPITAL INVESTED IN FREE ZONES, </p><p>INCLUDING PROFITS. </p><p> </p><p>16. QUALIFYING INDUSTRIAL ZONES (QIZ) </p><p> </p><p>APPROVED GOODS PRODUCED IN A "QUALIFYING INDUSTRIAL </p><p>ZONE" (QIZ) CAN BE IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES </p><p>FREE OF DUTY IF THEY INVOLVE ECONOMIC COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN JORDAN AND ISRAEL, AND IF 35 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>PRODUCT\'S CONTENT COMES FROM THE QIZ, ISRAEL, </p><p>AND/OR THE WEST BANK/GAZA.  THIS MAKES INVESTMENT </p><p>IN A QIZ PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO INDUSTRIES </p><p>WHOSE PRODUCTS ARE ASSESSED WITH HIGH TARIFFS WHEN </p><p>THEY ARE IMPORTED INTO THE U.S.  THERE ARE </p><p>CURRENTLY TEN QIZS, THREE OF WHICH ARE PUBLICLY </p><p>OWNED AND THE REMAINING SEVEN ARE PRIVATELY OWNED. </p><p>FOUR ADDITIONAL ZONES ARE PLANNED.  AS OF JUNE, </p><p>2002, THE BULK OF QIZ EXPORTERS HAVE BEEN </p><p>CONCENTRATING ON TEXTILE AND GARMENT EXPORTS. </p><p>SINCE 1999, THE QIZS HAVE ATTRACTED USD 248 MILLION </p><p>IN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, GENERATED USD 273 MILLION </p><p>IN EXPORTS TO THE U.S., AND CREATED OVER 22,000 NEW </p><p>JOBS. </p><p> </p><p>17. FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT STATISTICS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL STATISTICS ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT </p><p>(FDI) ARE NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. </p><p>THE UNCTAD\'S WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2001 </p><p>ESTIMATES FDI INFLOWS INTO JORDAN AT (USD MILLION): </p><p>158, 300 AND 350 FOR 1999, 2000, AND 2001 </p><p>RESPECTIVELY. </p><p>THE AMOUNT AND VALUE OF REGISTERED FOREIGN CAPITAL </p><p>IS THE CLOSEST AVAILABLE INDICATOR FOR A MORE </p><p>DETAILED ANALYSIS OF FDI. </p><p> </p><p>THE FOLLOWING STATISTICS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS </p><p>INDICATING TRENDS RATHER THAN EXACT FIGURES.
