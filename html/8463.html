<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 HARARE 001130 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, DRL, EB/IFD </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR DIRECTOR FRAZER </p><p>STATE PASS USAID </p><p>STATE PASS EXIM/OPIC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/01/2005 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, ECON, EFIN, KDEM, PHUM, PREL, SENV, SOCI, ZI, EXIM </p><p>SUBJECT: AFTER MUGABE: POST RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A U.S. </p><p>RESPONSE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Econchief William Weissman.  Reason: 1.5 (b/d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (c) Summary: While it is still uncertain whether President </p><p>Robert Mugabe will depart in the next days or months, Post </p><p>considers it prudent to offer policymakers "day after" </p><p>recommendations at this stage.  Assuming a transition </p><p>government is committed to political and economic reform, the </p><p>U.S. should immediately assist with elections, humanitarian </p><p>needs and infrastructure loan guarantees.  A transition </p><p>government will not completely overcome the country\'s </p><p>political divisions or recession, but it could lay the </p><p>foundation for a viable democracy and market economy.  To </p><p>accomplish this, we suggest the U.S. establish the legal </p><p>groundwork for waiving the Brooke-Alexander Amendment and </p><p>620(q) at the appropriate time. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (c) Of course, it matters not just that Mugabe goes, but </p><p>who comes.  We do not recommend policy modification if Mugabe </p><p>remains in power behind the scenes or if a transition </p><p>government is headed by a "hard-liner" - at least until we </p><p>discern which way the wind is blowing.  It is possible that </p><p>such a government would entrench itself and further restrict </p><p>liberties.  Even under a reformist government, we emphasize </p><p>that there is no quick fix for Zimbabwe.  It may take a </p><p>decade of healthly growth before the economy returns to 1997 </p><p>levels.  Health and education systems might not reach </p><p>mid-1990s levels for a generation, if ever. </p><p> </p><p>Transition Headed by Bonafide Reformist </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>3. (c) If, on the other hand, a reform-minded transition </p><p>government comes to power, the U.S. has a role in assuring </p><p>that the transition to a freely-elected government occurs and </p><p>that essential political and economic reforms are begun.  In </p><p>general, we could help steady Zimbabwe\'s first-ever political </p><p>transition under very trying circumstances.  We could begin </p><p>to rebuild a strained bilateral relationship and selectively </p><p>lift travel and financial sanctions.  If appropriate, we </p><p>could revise travel warnings that affect tourist inflows. </p><p>Codel and high-level USG visits would also underscore our </p><p>enthusiasm for a reforming Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>Democracy Assistance </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>4. (c) More specifically, we could help the transition </p><p>government\'s most pressing task - carrying out free and fair </p><p>elections, our top Mission Performance Plan goal.  USAID </p><p>should provide assistance and expertise to establish an </p><p>Independent Electoral Commission.  In order to promote an </p><p>environment in which candidates and parties can wage open and </p><p>non-violent election campaigns, the GOZ will need to </p><p>repeal/amend an existing body of repressive legislation, </p><p>including the Public Order and Security Act, the Access to </p><p>Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Elections Act </p><p>and the Media and Broadcasting Act.  As the new election </p><p>approaches, USAID would fund the training and deployment of </p><p>election observers, polling agents for political parties, </p><p>transparent ballot boxes and computerized voter rolls.  We </p><p>would also continue Voice of America and independent media </p><p>support.  Using existing mechanisms such as National </p><p>Democratic Institute, International Republican Institute and </p><p>State University of New York/Albany, we estimate additional </p><p>total cost at $7 million.  Some of these costs could be </p><p>shared with other donors, although we think that USAID, NDI, </p><p>IRI, and SUNY are in the best position to lead these </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p>Humanitarian/Economic Assistance </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>5. (c) To begin the process of economic recovery, we would </p><p>strongly encourage a reformist transition government to </p><p>modify/remove macroeconomic distortions by: </p><p> </p><p>- adopting the Zimdollar\'s floating (parallel) rate for </p><p>exporters </p><p>- raising interest rates (currently over 150 percent </p><p>negative) above inflation </p><p>- eliminating universal fuel and electricity subsidies </p><p>- reducing public borrowing and spending </p><p>- curtailing price controls </p><p>- disbanding the government\'s grain monopoly </p><p> </p><p>During the initial 6-12 month reform phase, we believe the </p><p>Zimbabwean economy, currently shrinking by an annualized rate </p><p>of 16 percent, will continue to recede.  Zimbabweans will </p><p>suffer as the country moves from an interventionist to market </p><p>economy, triggering acute humanitarian needs.  For that </p><p>reason, we should supplement existing assistance efforts by </p><p>immediately drawing  upon $250 million in PL 480 funds for </p><p>additional urban and rural feeding programs, contingent on </p><p>agricultural policy reforms.  From Disaster Assistance Funds, </p><p>we suggest $6 million for water treatment/purification </p><p>chemicals (covering approximately 6 months for Harare and </p><p>Bulawayo), $20 million for seeds and other agricultural </p><p>inputs, and $10 million for the national health system.  Of </p><p>the $10 million, channeled through USAID and the Centers for </p><p>Disease Control and Prevention, we would devote $5 million to </p><p>essential drugs, supplies and equipment, $3 million to </p><p>anti-retroviral therapy (ARV) sustaining between 3,000 and </p><p>5,000 persons and $2 million to an integrated network of </p><p>clinics for voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) and </p><p>prevention of mother to child transmission (MTCT). </p><p> </p><p>Financial Assistance </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>6. (c) A caveat:  It is imperative the U.S. only provide </p><p>financial support if the GOZ first moves aggressively to tear </p><p>down the distortions cited above.  It is not in the U.S. </p><p>interest to broadly subsidize fuel or electricity </p><p>consumption.  For approximately a year, Libya\'s Tamoil </p><p>infused over $300 million into Zimbabwe through fuel </p><p>donations, perpetuating macroeconomic distortions and </p><p>stunting growth.  The U.S. should not take over Libya\'s role, </p><p>as Zimbabwean businesses and consumers need to come to terms </p><p>with real-world tariffs.  After the elimination of these </p><p>subsidies, however, the U.S. could assist the GOZ to finance </p><p>public transport and minimum-use electricity for low-income </p><p>households.  For this purpose, we propose an initial $60 </p><p>million for a half-year through the PL480 or 416(b) programs, </p><p>generating local currency through monetized food programs. </p><p> </p><p>7. (c) In a reform environment, we also recommend OPIC and </p><p>ExIm Bank consider loan guarantees for projects that promote </p><p>U.S. exports and shore up Zimbabwe\'s dilapidated </p><p>infrastructure (in spite of existing arrears - see next </p><p>paragraph).  This could involve badly-needed rejuvenation of </p><p>General Electric locomotives at the National Railway of </p><p>Zimbabwe, Caterpillar machines at coal-miner Wankie Colliery </p><p>and Boeing jets at Air Zimbabwe.  Furthermore, the country\'s </p><p>participation in African Growth and Opportunity (AGOA) </p><p>sessions as an observer (with full admission following free </p><p>and fair elections) would allow Zimbabwean firms to plan a </p><p>reentry into the U.S. market.  (Most U.S.-bound textile </p><p>production here has migrated to AGOA countries.)   We should </p><p>also explore possibilities for including Zimbabwe in free </p><p>trade negotiations with the Southern Africa Customs Union. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Funding Obstacles </p><p>----------------- </p><p>8. (c) The main obstacle to much of this support is the </p><p>Brooke-Alexander Amendment and 620(q), legislation </p><p>prohibiting assistance to the GOZ because of its default on </p><p>official U.S. loans.  Overcoming Brooke-Alexander and 620(q) </p><p>requires that the GOZ become current on outstanding debt to </p><p>the U.S., or obtain a waiver.  GOZ arrearages on two ExIm </p><p>Bank loans total about $17 million and on a USAID loan about </p><p>$127,000.  Understandably, an incoming transition government </p><p>would not make a priority of paying down the ExIm arrears. </p><p>Thus, we recommend that the GOZ pay off the small USAID </p><p>arrears and receive a waiver of the Brooke-Alexander and </p><p>620(q) restrictions for the ExIm loan.  Additionally, we </p><p>might wish to report to Congress on how changes in Zimbabwe </p><p>impact upon Zimbabwe Democracy Act (ZDERA) implementation. </p><p>Post suggests the U.S. undertake a comprehensive legal </p><p>analysis of this option now and, for rapid response, have a </p><p>strategy already in place as soon as Mugabe departs. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>9. (c) We have outlined "day after" recommendations above. </p><p>Following free and fair elections, the U.S. could do a great </p><p>deal more.  We assume only a democratically-elected </p><p>government will be able to tackle Zimbabwe\'s most daunting </p><p>issues, such as rationalizing land reform, privatizing </p><p>inefficient parastatals and restarting International Monetary </p><p>Fund and WorldBank support.  At that point, the U.S. could </p><p>reengage Zimbabwe across the spectrum - granting debt relief, </p><p>redeploying the Peace Corps, offering AGOA membership, </p><p>including the country in President Bush\'s HIV/AIDS </p><p>initiative, restoring International Military Education and </p><p>Training (IMET) and lifting all sanctions.  There will be </p><p>ample time to plan for this during the transition phase. </p><p> </p><p>10. (c) While the above appears the most likely scenario, we </p><p>would wish to be flexible in case the transition government </p><p>is able and willing to undertake more thorough and </p><p>comprehensive reforms.  (After all, it would likely be far </p><p>easier to roll back land redistribution abuses with ZANU-PF </p><p>collaboration than with ZANU-PF opposing such changes from </p><p>the outside.)  In the event of a seriously reformist </p><p>transition government, we would also wish to encourage </p><p>agreement with the International Monetary Fund/WorldBank and </p><p>to consider use of the U.S. Treasury Exchange Stabilization </p><p>Fund as a bridge to an IMF loan. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
