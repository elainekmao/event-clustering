<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001479 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, KDEM, PINR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: RIOS MONTT CANDIDACY FACES FIRST LEGAL CHALLENGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The GOG\'s Registry of Citizens announced </p><p>on June 6 its rejection of Efrain Rios Montt\'s presidential </p><p>candidacy.  Rios Montt announced his intention to appeal the </p><p>decision, a process involving several different institutions </p><p>which could take months.  The deadline for candidates to be </p><p>registered for the November 9 election is September 9.  On </p><p>June 4, Congress appointed a new magistrate to the Supreme </p><p>Electoral Tribunal, filling a vacancy which some argued could </p><p>have clouded the legitimacy of the electoral process.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) On June 6, the Registry of Citizens turned down Rios </p><p>Montt\'s request for a certificate that he meets all the </p><p>qualifications established in the Constitution to be a </p><p>candidate for President.  Obtaining this certificate is the </p><p>first step for any candidate before they can register their </p><p>candidacy with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE).  The </p><p>decision, based on Article 186(a) of the Constitution, which </p><p>prohibits candidates who took office as a result of </p><p>extra-constitutional means, was expected.  Rios Montt\'s </p><p>request was based on the principle that the 1985 Constitution </p><p>is not retroactive in its application to his de-facto </p><p>presidency, from March 23, 1982 to August 8, 1983.  The </p><p>Registry decision noted that Article 186(a) was written in </p><p>the past tense, indicating retroactivity.  The Registry had </p><p>previously rejected Rios Montt\'s eligibility to run for </p><p>president in 1990 and 1995. </p><p> </p><p>Reaction to Registry Decision </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) While the political opposition and constitutional </p><p>scholars applauded the Registry\'s ruling, Rios Montt said he </p><p>will appeal.  On June 7 he told reporters that the Registry </p><p>had exceeded its authority by making a legal interpretation </p><p>of his qualifications.  President Portillo also supported </p><p>Rios Montt\'s right to run, saying he knew of "no impediment" </p><p>to his candidacy.  On the campaign trail in Western </p><p>Guatemala, Rios Montt reportedly declared that "if they do </p><p>not permit me to participate, they will violate my rights, </p><p>the law is not retroactive and it will be the people who </p><p>elevate me to the Presidency."  Asked if the FRG was </p><p>considering a replacement candidate, he said "there is no </p><p>substitute."  The FRG reportedly filed an appeal with the </p><p>Registry after its decision on June 6.  Rios Montt drew a </p><p>crowd of 20,000 supporters in Totonicapan on June 6, and </p><p>continued to campaign over the June 7-8 weekend.  Civil </p><p>society and some opposition party representatives hailed the </p><p>Registry\'s decision as strengthening the rule of law in </p><p>Guatemala. </p><p> </p><p>The Appeal Process </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The Registry\'s rejection of Rios Montt\'s candidacy </p><p>can be appealed to the Department of Political Organizations </p><p>of the Registry of Citizens within three days.  (Note: Press </p><p>reported that the FRG sent documents to the Registry on June </p><p>6.  End Note.)  The director of the Registry has 8 days to </p><p>decide on the appeal.  If the Registry reaffirms its ruling, </p><p>the FRG can appeal to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.  The </p><p>Tribunal\'s ruling, in turn, can be appealed to the Supreme </p><p>Court\'s Court of Appeals.  Finally, the Supreme Court\'s </p><p>ruling can be appealed to the Constitutional Court, </p><p>constituted as the Extraordinary Tribunal of Injunction </p><p>("Amparo," in Spanish). </p><p> </p><p>Congress Fills a Gap on the TSE </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) On June 4 Congress elected Sergio Mijangos to fill a </p><p>vacancy on the TSE by 77 votes from the FRG and PAN. </p><p>Mijangos was elected to serve as the replacement for a judge </p><p>who never took office, creating a vacuum in the 5-member </p><p>court.  Mijangos had served as Registrar of Property and </p><p>Secretary General of the Public Ministry from 1994-96. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) The decision by the Registry of Persons is  a </p><p>significant, if expected, blow to Rios Montt\'s candidacy. </p><p>The Registry\'s legal challenge is significant in that it </p><p>forces Rios Montt (rather than his many opponents) to file </p><p>the appeal.  The FRG leadership has vowed to pursue appeals </p><p>at all levels to resolve the eligibility issue by September </p><p>9, the deadline for inscription of candidates.  Politically, </p><p>the Registry\'s ruling main significance is to show that at </p><p>least one Guatemalan official institution does not believe </p><p>that Rios Montt is constitutionally eligible to be a </p><p>candidate. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
