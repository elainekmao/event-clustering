<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ROME 002200 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM FOR J5, POLAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, PGOV, EAID, MOPS, MCAP, IZ, IT, IRAQI FREEDOM, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: MARTINO OUTLINES DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ FOR PARLIAMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  ITALIAN MOD MARTINO TOLD PARLIAMENT MAY 14 THAT </p><p>A CONTINGENT OF ABOUT 3000 MILITARY PERSONNEL WILL BE </p><p>DEPLOYED AND OPERATIONAL IN IRAQ BY MID-JULY.  TWO MINESWEEPS </p><p>THAT ARE ALREADY IN THEATER WILL BECOME OPERATIONAL SOONER. </p><p>AN ADVANCE TEAM WILL DEPART FOR IRAQ WITHIN DAYS TO ASSESS </p><p>ON-THE-GROUND NEEDS FOR THE TROOPS.  PARLIAMENT APPROVED </p><p>MILITARY SUPPORT IN AN APRIL 15 VOTE ON ITALY,S </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION, AND THE GOI IS FUNDING </p><p>THE DEPLOYMENT THROUGH AN EXPEDITED PROCESS.  THE TROOPS ARE </p><p>SEPARATE FROM THE UNIT OF CARABINIERI THAT DEPARTED MAY 15 </p><p>FOR IRAQ TO PROTECT THE ITALIAN RED CROSS FIELD HOSPITAL IN </p><p>BAGHDAD, ACCORDING TO MARTINO.  THE CENTER-RIGHT COALITION </p><p>PRAISED MARTINO FOR KEEPING PARLIAMENT FULLY INFORMED AND </p><p>APPROVED THE MISSION.  THE CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION CRITICIZED </p><p>THE GOI FOR ITS SUBSERVIENCE TO THE U.S.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>MISSION IS HUMANITARIAN, PARLIAMENT TO APPROVE FUNDING ONLY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  MOD MARTINO APPEARED BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE SENATE </p><p>AND CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENSE </p><p>COMMITTEES MAY 14 TO BRIEF ON THE PLANNED DEPLOYMENT OF </p><p>ITALIAN TROOPS TO IRAQ.  HE STRESSED THAT THE MISSION -- CODE </p><p>NAMED "ANCIENT BABYLONIA" -- IS FOR HUMANITARIAN AND </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION PURPOSES, AND TO PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT TO THE </p><p>LOCAL POPULATION.  HE STATED THAT IT IS EXPECTED TO LAST SIX </p><p>MONTHS LEAVING, HOWEVER, THE DOOR OPEN FOR A POSSIBLE </p><p>EXTENSION.  HE REMARKED THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY VOTE AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THE MISSION HAD </p><p>ALREADY BEEN AUTHORIZED BY PARLIAMENT IN ITS APRIL 15 VOTE, </p><p>BUT SAID PARLIAMENT WILL HAVE TO APPROVE FUNDING.  THE GOI IS </p><p>PROVIDING IMMEDIATE FUNDING THROUGH A DECREE LAW THAT WILL </p><p>SOON BE PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT FOR ITS DISCUSSION AND FINAL </p><p>APPROVAL.  MARTINO DID NOT INDICATE WHEN THE GOI WOULD </p><p>PRESENT THE DECREE, BUT SAID IT WILL INCLUDE CIVIL </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING COORDINATED BY THE </p><p>MFA. (NOTE: UNDER ITALY,S CONSTITUTION, DECREE LAWS ARE </p><p>TOOLS FOR URGENT MATTERS; THEY ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND </p><p>VALID FOR 60 DAYS.  PARLIAMENT HAS 60 DAYS TO DISCUSS, AMEND </p><p>AND APPROVE A DECREE LAW OR IT EXPIRES.  TO THE BEST OF OUR </p><p>KNOWLEDGE, THIS NEVER HAPPENS WITH DECREES INVOLVING FUNDING </p><p>FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE MISSIONS.

HE SAID THE TROOPS WILL BE </p><p>SUBJECT TO THE ITALIAN MILITARY CODE OF WAR AS IT WAS </p><p>RECENTLY AMENDED AND ASSURED PARLIAMENT THAT THEY WILL </p><p>EXERCISE THE LOWEST POSSIBLE USE OF FORCE, IN COMPLIANCE WITH </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ITALIAN LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  THE </p><p>TROOPS WILL BE UNDER THE OPERATIONAL COMMAND OF THE ITALIAN </p><p>CHIEF OF DEFENSE STAFF, "BUT THE BRITISH DIVISIONAL COMMAND </p><p>HEADQUARTERED IN BASRA WILL HAVE OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONTINGENTS, INCLUDING THE ITALIANS, IN THE </p><p>ENTIRE SOUTHERN SECTOR." </p><p> </p><p>MARTINO EXPLAINS TASKS... </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.
