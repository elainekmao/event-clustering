<p>S E C R E T LAGOS 000351 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DS/IP/ITA, DS/IP/AF, DS/ICI/PII </p><p>FBIHQ FOR CTD/WMDOU </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: X1.6 </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, PINS, PARM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: LOST RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: RSO J. Pelphrey.  Reason 1.5 (d) and (g) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Summary:  CG, LEGATT, and RSO met with Johan Bakker, </p><p>Vice President of Haliburton Nigeria on 02/18/03.  Mr. Bakker </p><p>advised the CG that a radioactive source used in logging </p><p>operations was missing.  Mr. Bakker advised that the material </p><p>was approximately 18.5 curries in strength and had been </p><p>missing since late November or early December.  Haliburton </p><p>and Chevrontexaco corporate investigators had been conducting </p><p>investigations, but they had not been able to determine who </p><p>took the material, exactly when or where it was taken.  In </p><p>view of the current world situation, Haliburton was notifying </p><p>the Consulate. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  CG, LEGATT, and RSO met with Johan Bakker, Vice </p><p>President of Haliburton Nigeria concerning missing </p><p>radioactive material.  The material was described as </p><p>approximately four to five inches in length and one to one </p><p>and a half inches in diameter with a strength of 18.5 </p><p>curries.  The radioactive material is used in the oil </p><p>industry for logging operations.  The material was placed in </p><p>a "pig", a cylinder approximately eighteen inches in diameter </p><p>and weighing ninety-four kilograms.  The "pig" was then </p><p>placed in a box with radioactive markings on the side. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  The radioactive material had been used in oilfield </p><p>operations at a  Chevrontexaco site and was supposed to be </p><p>transported back to Haliburton\'s operational base.  The "pig" </p><p>was stored at Escavros in late November and transported to </p><p>Warri where it was picked up for transshipment to Port </p><p>Harcourt on or about December 4th.  Although it is unclear </p><p>when the material was taken, the driver reportedly claimed to </p><p>a Haliburton investigator that the locks on the box </p><p>containing the "pig" were broken when the box was picked up </p><p>and placed on a flatbed truck for shipment.  No other items </p><p>on the flatbed were taken or disturbed during the trip. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  The flatbed stopped overnight in a village during </p><p>the transit from Warri to Port Harcourt.  Investigators, who </p><p>have tried to interview local villagers, have been </p><p>unsuccessful.  Initially, Haliburton officials believed the </p><p>material may have been taken for ransom, but no demands have </p><p>been made.  It is also believed that someone who may not know </p><p>what the material is may have thrown it away.  There is </p><p>concern that anyone who handled the material for any length </p><p>of time may have died or is critically ill.  A one meter </p><p>exposure for sixty-eight minutes is considered lethal </p><p>according to Mr. Bakker. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  Nigerian federal, state, and local authorities have </p><p>been notified of the missing radioactive material and the </p><p>IAEA has been contacted.  Nigerian police are continuing </p><p>their investigation.  Haliburton and Chevrontexaco brought in </p><p>investigators from London who have assisted with their </p><p>continuing investigations as well.  Local populations have </p><p>been offered a fifty thousand Naira (approximately 400 USD) </p><p>reward for information leading to the return of the material. </p><p> To date, only two attempts have been made to collect the </p><p>reward and neither was considered credible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  A report of Haliburton\'s attempts to recover the </p><p>material along with photos of the neutron pig and shipping </p><p>container has been forwarded to FBIHQ and will be forwarded </p><p>to the Department. </p><p>HINSON-JONES </p><p></p></div>
