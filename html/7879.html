SUMMARY:  PRESIDENT BUSH\'S NOMINATION OF AMBASSADOR PAUL </p><p>BREMER TO LEAD THE RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ, THE ROADMAP, AND </p><p>ISRAEL\'S DEMAND FOR SANCTIONS ON SYRIA DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE </p><p>PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  UAE COLUMNIST, DR. ABDULKHALEQ </p><p>ABDULLA NOTED IN "AL KHALEEJ" HOW SHAMEFUL IT IS THAT IRAQIS HAVE </p><p>MORE FREEDOM TO PURSUE LIBERTY THAN ARABS IN OTHER ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES.  IN "AL ITTIHAD," DR. SHAMLAN AL EISSA CRITICIZED THE </p><p>DOUBLE STANDARD OF GCC COUNTRIES DEMANDING AN END TO THE U.S. </p><p>PRESENCE IN IRAQ WHILE ALLOWING TROOPS IN THEIR COUNTRIES.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  COMMENTING ON THE FORTHCOMING UN CONFERENCE ON WMD IN GENEVA </p><p>AND ISRAEL\'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE CONFERENCE, DUBAI-BASED </p><p>BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 5/07: </p><p> </p><p>"... THIS ENTITY (ISRAEL) REFUSES TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT FOR </p><p>LIMITING THE SPREAD OF WMD AT A TIME WHEN BOTH SYRIA AND EGYPT </p><p>SUGGEST THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT TO CLEAR THE MIDDLE </p><p>EAST OF THESE WEAPONS.  REGRETTABLY, WASHINGTON REFUSED THIS </p><p>SUGGESTION.  THE SUPERVISION OF THE ZIONIST ENTITY AT THE GENEVA </p><p>CONFERENCE FOR REMOVING WMD IS AN INTERNATIONAL COMEDY THAT MAKES </p><p>THE UN NOT ONLY LOSE ITS CREDIBILITY, BUT ALSO ITS VISION, SINCE </p><p>IT CAN\'T SEE WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG IN AN ERA OF </p><p>AMERICAN EXPANSION." </p><p> </p><p>3.  CLAIMING THAT THE IRAQI PEOPLE IN U.S.-OCCUPIED IRAQ ARE MORE </p><p>FREE TO PURSUE THEIR LIBERTY THAN THE ARAB PEOPLE IN INDEPENDENT </p><p>ARAB COUNTRIES AND LABELING THIS A SHAMEFUL REALITY, UAE </p><p>COLUMNIST DR. ABDULKHALEQ ABDULLA WROTE IN SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB </p><p>DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" ON 5/06: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE IMPORTANT THING FOR ARABS IS THAT THE IRAQI EXAMPLE DOES </p><p>NOT REOCCUR.  THE PAINFUL EXPERIMENT IN IRAQ SHOULD NOT REOCCUR </p><p>IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE ARAB WORLD.  THE EQUATION OF LIBERTY </p><p>DURING OCCUPATION EQUALED BY TYRANNY DURING INDEPENDENCE COULD </p><p>LEAD TO THE REAPPEARANCE OF THIS EXPERIMENT IN IRAQ.  THE BEST </p><p>WAY TO STOP THIS IS THROUGH INTERNAL POLITICAL REFORM, IN </p><p>ADDITION TO IMPLEMENTING LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY, SOMETHING THAT </p><p>SHOULD BE ON THE TOP OF THE LIST OF NATIONAL PRIORITIES IN THE </p><p>PERIOD AFTER THE WAR ON IRAQ." </p><p> </p><p>4.  CRITICIZING THE GCC COUNTRIES\' POLICIES DEMANDING AN END TO </p><p>THE U.S. PRESENCE IN IRAQ WHILE ALLOWING U.S. TROOPS IN THEIR </p><p>COUNTRIES, COLUMNIST DR. SHAMLAN AL EISSA WROTE IN ABU DHABI- </p><p>BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" 5/06: </p><p> </p><p>"... WHAT WE REALLY REFUSE IS THE GCC COUNTRIES DOUBLE STANDARD </p><p>POLICY TOWARDS IRAQ.  ON ONE HAND THEY ACCEPT THE AMERICAN- </p><p>BRITISH-WESTERN PRESENCE IN THEIR COUNTRIES, WHILE ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, THEY REQUEST THAT THE U.S. TROOPS LEAVE IRAQ AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE.  WHY IS IT OKAY FOR THE GCC COUNTRIES TO HAVE U.S. </p><p>TROOPS TO PROTECT THEM WHILE IT IS FORBIDDEN FOR IRAQ TO HAVE ANY </p><p>OF THESE TROOPS ON ITS LANDS, ALTHOUGH IRAQ TODAY IS IN NEED OF </p><p>THE U.S. PRESENCE MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY BECAUSE OF ALL THE </p><p>CHAOS AND INSECURITY IN MOST CITIES IN IRAQ ..." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
