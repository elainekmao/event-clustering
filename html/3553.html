<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 001913 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT KANSTEINER/NATSIOS BRIEFING; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   The transcript of a press briefing by USAID </p><p>      Administrator Natsios and A/S Kansteiner on food aid to </p><p>      Southern Africa received prominent placement in the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald."  The </p><p>      independent weekly "The Financial Gazette" also </p><p>      published a Reuters account of the Natsios/Kansteiner </p><p>      press briefing. </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "Plot to oust President: U. S. </p><p>      masterminds plan; SADC states deny involvement" the </p><p>      "Herald" (08/22) carried the following lead story: </p><p> </p><p>      "The U. S. claims it is working with the </p><p>      European Union (EU) and three SADC countries to </p><p>      topple President Mugabe and his government from </p><p>      office but the African governments yesterday </p><p>      scoffed at the American claims.  U. S. Assistant </p><p>      Secretary for African Affairs Mr. Walter </p><p>      Kansteiner claimed his government was working </p><p>      with South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, the EU, </p><p>      several other countries throughout the world, </p><p>      civil society and some journalists in the </p><p>      private media in Zimbabwe to remove the </p><p>      President and government from office.  But South </p><p>      Africa, Botswana and Mozambique yesterday </p><p>      distanced themselves from Mr. Kansteiner\'s </p><p>      statement, saying they were not aware of any </p><p>      such plans. </p><p> </p><p>      "South Africa\'s presidential spokesman Mr. Bheki </p><p>      Khumalo said his government was not aware of any </p><p>      plans to remove the Zimbabwean government from </p><p>      office.  `I don\'t know anything about it.  I </p><p>      don\'t know where it (Mr. Kansteiner\'s statement) </p><p>      comes from,\' said Mr. Khumalo.  Botswana denied </p><p>      it was working closely with the U. S., South </p><p>      Africa and Mozambique to find ways of isolating </p><p>      President Mugabe.  `Botswana is not involved in </p><p>      such a scheme,\' Botswana foreign affairs </p><p>      spokesman Mr. Clifford Maribe told `The Herald.\' </p><p>      `We are not aware of these reports.  We will not </p><p>      participate in such schemes.  Issues related to </p><p>      Zimbabwe are being handled by Zimbabwe as a </p><p>      sovereign country,\' Mr. Maribe said.  `Botswana </p><p>      will never meddle in the internal affairs of </p><p>      another country.\'  Mozambique also denied the </p><p>      statement by the U. S. official, saying it was </p><p>      not aware of such a plan to remove the </p><p>      government of Zimbabwe from office.  `I am not </p><p>      aware of any initiative of that kind with us. </p><p>      Our approach to Zimbabwe is to bring everybody </p><p>      on board to find solutions,\' Reuters quoted </p><p>      Mozambican Foreign Affairs Minister Mr. Leonardo </p><p>      Simao as saying. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .USAID head Mr. Andrew Natsios, speaking at </p><p>      the same press conference, said the current food </p><p>      shortage in Zimbabwe were a result of drought </p><p>      but went on to attack the government\'s land </p><p>      reform program, claiming that white commercial </p><p>      farmers whose farms have been acquired for </p><p>      resettlement were being prevented from farming </p><p>      to feed the nation.  Statistics, however, show </p><p>      that smallholder and communal farmers produce a </p><p>      large proportion of Zimbabwe\'s staple crop, </p><p>      maize. . .  He also accused the government of </p><p>      distributing food along political lines.  But </p><p>      investigations by the EU and World Food Program </p><p>      offices in Zimbabwe have shown that aid was not </p><p>      being distributed according to political </p><p>      affiliation.  Representatives of the two </p><p>      organizations said at a recent Press conference </p><p>      in Harare that food was going to deserving </p><p>      cases." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "Club gears up to expel Zim" (a </p><p>      page-one report on the possibility that the </p><p>      Commonwealth could expel Zimbabwe), the "Financial </p><p>      Gazette" (08/22) also mentioned A/S Kansteiner\'s </p><p>      remarks: ".In a sign of growing impatience by the </p><p>      international community over Harare\'s conduct, U. S. </p><p>      Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Walter </p><p>      Kansteiner this week said Washington did not recognize </p><p>      Mugabe\'s presidency and wanted him isolated further. </p><p>      . . .Zimbabwe accused the U. S. and Britain </p><p>      yesterday of a `racist\' campaign to isolate </p><p>      Mugabe internationally and maintain white </p><p>      economic dominance in southern Africa. . .\'  The </p><p>      legitimacy of our political system or our </p><p>      President is not dependent on America, Britain </p><p>      or any other country but on Zimbabweans,\' a </p><p>      senior Zimbabwean official said.  `The bullying </p><p>      tactics that America and Britain are using </p><p>      against us are meant to frustrate our quest for </p><p>      social and economic justice, to stop our program </p><p>      to redistribute some of the very large tracts of </p><p>      land held by whites here to the indigenous black </p><p>      people,\' he said." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
