<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002559 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/21/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: COURT FINDS FORMER MP GUILTY OF SLANDERING </p><p>GOVERNMENT, SENTENCES HER TO  1 1/2 YEARS IN PRISON. </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm Reason: 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p> SUMMARY </p><p> -------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  The State Security Court May 16 sentenced former </p><p>Member of Parliament Toujan Faisal to one and a half years </p><p>in prison.  Because she was convicted of only </p><p>"misdemeanors," she has no right to appeal.  Faisal was </p><p>convicted on all of four charges levied against her:  1) </p><p>slandering the judiciary, 2) publishing false and </p><p>exaggerated news abroad deemed harmful to the country\'s </p><p>integrity, 3) publishing false material deemed harmful to </p><p>the country and its citizens and 4) insulting the faith of </p><p>another.  Faisal\'s prosecution appears to be the result of </p><p>a political vendetta by PM Abul Ragheb, against whom she </p><p>made public allegations of corruption.  Even though an </p><p>isolated incident, Faisal\'s conviction serves as an </p><p>unfortunate reminder that the GOJ still has the ability to </p><p>use the judicial system against its domestic critics -- at </p><p>least against those who, like Faisal, are unpopular and </p><p>politically isolated. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>BACKGROUND ) AN UNPOPULAR OPPONENT </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Toujan Faisal was elected to Parliament in 1993 -- </p><p>the only woman ever to be elected by popular vote.  She was </p><p>not reelected in 1997.  She was active in Jordanian media </p><p>and government before her tenure as an MP.  After her 1997 </p><p>electoral loss and prior to her March 16 arrest, Faisal was </p><p>seen almost universally as a political opportunist who had </p><p>little public support and who was essentially finished as a </p><p>politician.  Even the most ardent of Faisal\'s supporters </p><p>have abandoned her of late.  In a 19 May meeting with </p><p>POLOFF, Faisal\'s former campaign manager lamented the </p><p>former MP\'s political demise, stating that Faisal had blown </p><p>her opportunity to be the liberal )- as opposed to Islamic </p><p>)- opposition leader in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Among other public attacks on the GOJ, Faisal </p><p>accused Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb of corruption; her </p><p>specific charge was that he and his family were profiting </p><p>from a law that raised auto insurance premiums.  On a </p><p>recent venture to Iraq, Faisal publicly blasted the GOJ </p><p>from Baghdad, alleging in front of an Iraqi audience that </p><p>King Abdullah II and the PM were corrupt.  In addition, she </p><p>sent a letter to the King accusing several other officials </p><p>of corruption.  Following her arrest, Faisal was first </p><p>released following the intervention of prominent members of </p><p>the Circassian community with the PM.  However, following </p><p>further statements by Faisal critical of PM Abul Ragheb, </p><p>her Circassian supporters apparently absolved themselves of </p><p>any responsibility for her actions, and Faisal was </p><p>rearrested three days later and incarcerated pending trial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>VENDETTA POLITICS </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>  4. (C)  It appears that the notoriously thin-skinned PM, </p><p>despite efforts by senior GOJ officials to mollify his </p><p>anger, personally made the decision to punish Faisal for </p><p>her public allegations against him, the King and others. </p><p>PAO reports that, in a recent dinner with senior GOJ </p><p>officials, Minister of Tourism Taleb Rifai openly </p><p>challenged the tactics employed by the PM against Faisal; </p><p>Minister of Higher Education Walid Maani defended the PM\'s </p><p>actions and Minister of Telecommunication Fawaz Zobi sought </p><p>to moderate and tone down the heated discussion (which </p><p>occurred in the presence of senior Embassy officials).  The </p><p>Ambassador also raised the Faisal case during the course of </p><p>her trial with PM Abul Ragheb, who was unrepentant, </p><p>accusing Faisal of spreading lies about him and other </p><p>cabinet ministers. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Former MP and Islamic Action Front (IAF) member </p><p>Abdullah Akayleh told POLOFF in a May 15 meeting that the </p><p>whole event is an example of Jordanian politics at its </p><p>worst, with the PM actually raising the profile of and </p><p>lending credence to the allegation of a nearly forgotten </p><p>former MP.  In a 16 May meeting with POLOFF, a senior GOJ </p><p>official heatedly criticized the tactics of the PM, stating </p><p>that it was bad for Jordan and bad for the King.  This view </p><p>is widespread in political circles, although the PM </p><p>continues to hold support for his actions against Faisal, </p><p>in particular from former PM Zaid bin Shakr. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- -------------------- </p><p>THE VERDICT MAKES FAISAL INELIGIBLE TO SERVE IN PARLIAMENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>6.  (C)  The State Security Court May 16 found Faisal </p><p>guilty of all four misdemeanor charges levied against her </p><p>and sentenced her to 18 months in custody  Most people </p><p>familiar with the case expected Faisal to be given a six- </p><p>month sentence, although the Court had the authority to </p><p>sentence her for up to three years.  Since these crimes are </p><p>technically "misdemeanors," the amendments made to the </p><p>State Security Court law last September prohibit an appeal. </p><p>In addition, the eighteen- month sentence will likely </p><p>prevent her from running for the Parliament in the future: </p><p>the Constitution bars candidacy for all those who have </p><p>received a sentence in excess of one year.  In a 19 May </p><p>meeting with POLOFF, a local reporter indicated that there </p><p>is discussion about the possibility of the King commuting </p><p>Faisal\'s sentence. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Faisal is unpopular in the political establishment </p><p>and is seen by most as an obstreperous political </p><p>opportunist.  Over the years her traditional supporters, </p><p>i.e. educated, anti-islamist women, have essentially </p><p>abandoned her because of her abrasive manner and </p><p>ineffectiveness on key issues.  Nevertheless, PM Abul </p><p>Ragheb\'s politically motivated prosecution has made her </p><p>appear to be a victim of GOJ persecution, given her </p><p>allegations of corruption greater local political weight, </p><p>and -- at least temporarily -- raised her political </p><p>profile.  The harsh prison sentence -- likely given to </p><p>prevent Faisal from running for Parliament in the future -- </p><p>may make some Jordanians think twice about firing salvos </p><p>toward the government.  However, it has also emboldened </p><p>some regime critics ) ironically including her political </p><p>adversary the Islamic Action Front -- who have adopted </p><p>Faisal\'s case as a club to use to beat up the government. </p><p>While Faisal\'s case appears to be an isolated incident, her </p><p>prosecution, conviction, and harsh sentence show that </p><p>senior GOJ officials can still use the judicial system to </p><p>attack domestic critics. </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
