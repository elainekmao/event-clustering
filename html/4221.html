<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 003037 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR C.GURNEY -- PASS TO A/S KANSTEINER AND AMB. </p><p>JETER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 11/04/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AFENIFERE LEADER SAYS "NO" TO A NORTHERN </p><p>PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 2990 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: During an October 23 Lagos meeting </p><p>with Ambassador Jeter, Afenifere leader Senator </p><p>Abraham Adesanya labeled the impeachment threat </p><p>against Obasanjo a ruse to return national political </p><p>power to the North. Although not an Obasanjo </p><p>supporter, Adesanya was adamant that the Presidency </p><p>remain in Southern hands after the 2003 elections. </p><p>Adesanya felt a national conference was needed to </p><p>establish a national consensus before unbridled </p><p>political competition degenerated into something more </p><p>regrettable -- disunion. The Afenifere head believed a </p><p>key to alleviating the mounting tension surrounding </p><p>the 203 election was the swift enactment of a </p><p>constitutional amendment limiting the President and </p><p>Governors to one five-year term in office. End Summary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> --------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> OBASANJO TRICKED THE NORTH; NOW THEY WANT HIS JOB </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On October 23, Ambassador Jeter met Senator </p><p>Adesanya, head of "Afenifere," the preeminent Yoruba </p><p>socio-cultural organization, at Adesanya\'s Lagos </p><p>residence. Adesanya was joined by former Babangida era </p><p>Foreign Minister A. Bola Akinyemi (1985-87), now a </p><p>close Adesanya aide.  Ambassador Jeter was accompanied </p><p>by his Staff Assistant and PolCouns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Adesanya, a rather spry and energetic </p><p>octogenarian, began the substantive discussion by </p><p>claiming that Obasanjo was wandering in a political no </p><p>man\'s land because he had broken rank with the </p><p>Northern establishment who "selected" him into office </p><p>in 1999.  The North misread Obasanjo, thinking he was </p><p>the same malleable Head of State who allowed his </p><p>deputy Shehu Yar\'Adua, a Northerner, to call many of </p><p>the shots from 1976-79. In his second coming, Obasanjo </p><p>was bent on being his own man, to the chagrin of </p><p>Northern king makers who thought their electoral </p><p>support had tied enough strings to Obasanjo to control </p><p>him, Adesanya postulated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>TIME FOR A NATIONAL CONFERENCE IS NOW! </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) While visibly delighted that Obasanjo\'s </p><p>bullheadedness had foiled these perceived Northern </p><p>machinations, Adesanya nonetheless criticized </p><p>Obasanjo\'s stubbornness in not embracing the idea of a </p><p>national conference. Obasanjo was out of step with </p><p>dominant thought in his own Southwestern region, </p><p>Adesanya complained. The President\'s lack of </p><p>commanding support in Yorubaland was traceable, to a </p><p>large extent, to his ambivalence regarding a national </p><p>conference. Obasanjo was apprehensive the conference, </p><p>once convened, might veer from the stated purpose of </p><p>Nigerian unity to become the prelude to Nigeria\'s </p><p>dismemberment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Yet, most Yorubas supported the idea and still </p><p>wanted Nigeria to remain united; however, Adesanya </p><p>explained that his people were absolutely tired of </p><p>investing more in Nigeria than what they derived from </p><p>it while other areas (i.e. the North) gave little and </p><p>got much. A national conference was needed to </p><p>establish the heretofore-elusive national consensus. </p><p>The conference also was required to determine "who we </p><p>are and what we will do" as Nigerians, he expounded. </p><p>Without such a harmonizing conference, a terrible day </p><p>of reckoning awaited the country, Adesanya forecasted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Adesanya dismissed the present constitution and </p><p>its 1979 antecedent as not fitting the bill.  Both </p><p>instruments were, in part, the work of conferences of </p><p>eminent persons.  However, these conferences were </p><p>convened and controlled by then reigning military </p><p>governments. Moreover, military Heads of State, </p><p>including Obasanjo in 1979, could and did unilaterally </p><p>change the documents presented to him by the </p><p>deliberative assembly. Because these constitutions </p><p>were, from their inception, subject to the caprice of </p><p>a single individual, the documents never gained the </p><p>sanctity and the respect usually reposed in the </p><p>parchment containing a nation\'s organic law. </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>PATRIOTS TO THE RESCUE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Adesanya, also a key member of the "Patriots" </p><p>by virtue of his leadership of Afenifere, said he </p><p>endorsed the Patriots\' public statement asking </p><p>Obasanjo to forego a second term.  While asking </p><p>Obasanjo not to seek reelection, he stressed the </p><p>Patriots had opposed the impeachment threat against </p><p>Obasanjo. "Why did the House wait so long to object to </p><p>Obasanjo\'s alleged wrongdoings?" queried Adesanya. </p><p>Due to their prolonged silence on some matters and </p><p>active complacency on others, the House " was </p><p>estopped" from fustigating the President to the point </p><p>of seeking his removal.  If Obasanjo must go, the </p><p>lawmakers should go as well, declared Adesanya. At </p><p>this late stage in the electoral calendar, the </p><p>Patriots believed that impeachment was remarkably ill </p><p>timed. Adesanya denigrated impeachment advocates as </p><p>political "troublemakers" bent on shifting power from </p><p>the Southwest back to the North, since VP Atiku would </p><p>have assumed the Presidency upon Obasanjo\'s removal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) The Northern politicians mistakenly thought </p><p>they could threaten Obasanjo with impeachment because </p><p>they supported his 1999 election more than his own </p><p>Yoruba clan. However, on becoming President, Obasanjo </p><p>also came to represent the South\'s ability to govern </p><p>the nation. Thus, impeachment was not just about </p><p>Obasanjo and his alleged wrongs. Northern moves to </p><p>impeach him were tantamount to a coup in the eyes of </p><p>the South and thus had kindled regional antagonism, </p><p>Adesanya declared. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>A SOUTHERN PRESIDENT, JUST NOT OBASANJO </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) The Patriots believed power should remain in </p><p>Southern hands after the coming election.  Adesanya </p><p>explained the group was established several years ago </p><p>by Southwestern and Southeastern politicians </p><p>frustrated that the North had controlled national </p><p>politics by playing the two Southern zones against </p><p>each other.  In the Patriots, the Southwest was </p><p>represented mainly by members of Afenifere and the </p><p>Southeast by Ohaneze Ndigbo.  Later, the Union of </p><p>Delta States brought the South-South into the fold. </p><p>Membership was also extended to some key opinion </p><p>makers from the Middle Belt as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>FIVE TIMES ONE IS BETTER THAN FOUR TIMES TWO </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The Patriots backed the proposed </p><p>constitutional amendment of one five-year term for the </p><p>President and State Governors, believing the change </p><p>would reduce political tension.  Adesanya claimed that </p><p>politics was becoming too rabid because many office- </p><p>holders sought to secure second terms even in the face </p><p>of adamant, powerful opposition against their return. </p><p>The only way to avoid spiraling tension was to </p><p>constitutionalize the one-term requirement.  The </p><p>former Senator commented that the requirement had the </p><p>salutary benefit of postponing elections for a year -- </p><p>hopefully giving the woefully unprepared Independent </p><p>National Electoral Commission time to plan for </p><p>elections in 2004 instead of early 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Adesanya further explained that, if Obasanjo </p><p>were given an extra year but not allowed to contest </p><p>again, he would have an incentive to ensure that INEC </p><p>was effective and impartial. Obasanjo\'s political </p><p>legacy would not be based on his re-election but on </p><p>the quality of his oversight of the first successful </p><p>civilian-to-civilian election and transfer of power in </p><p>Nigeria\'s history.  Adesanya felt the amendment could </p><p>be passed quickly, provided the State Legislatures </p><p>acted fast. However, he acknowledged that most State </p><p>Governors would oppose the measure and that, unlike </p><p>the President\'s relationship with the National </p><p>Assembly, the state executives exercised great </p><p>influence over their respective Houses of Assembly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>NORTHERN CANDIDATES PROSPECTS IN THE SOUTH </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Responding to questions from Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Adesanya predicted that VP Atiku would have trouble </p><p>gaining support in the Southwest if he wrestled the </p><p>PDP nomination from Obasanjo. While Obasanjo was not </p><p>highly popular, he was Yoruba and "this transcended </p><p>personality."  Atiku\'s candidacy would be negatively </p><p>viewed as a premature " power shift" because </p><p>Northerners believed the Presidency was their </p><p>birthright and could not countenance seeing an </p><p>independent Southerner at the helm. Adesanya predicted </p><p>strong opposition would also confront Atiku in the </p><p>South-South and the Southeast. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) The Afenifere leader discounted that Atiku </p><p>could make inroads by selecting a Yoruba, such as </p><p>longtime Atiku friend Lagos State Governor Tinubu, as </p><p>his Vice Presidential running mate. Suggesting Tinubu </p><p>was already in Afenifere\'s doghouse, Adesanya quipped </p><p>Tinubu was having too much trouble running Lagos to </p><p>aspire to the headache of governing the rest of </p><p>Nigeria.  Adesanya doubted if Tinubu would have the </p><p>effrontery to team with Atiku. Chuckling "we will </p><p>cross that bridge when we get to it," Adesanya left </p><p>the clear impression that he would relish the chance </p><p>to teach the Lagos Governor a few old-fashioned </p><p>lessons about internal Yoruba politics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) Regarding former Head of State Babangida, </p><p>Adesanya said he would also find difficulty in the </p><p>Southwest. Adesanya expostulated that former Head of </p><p>State Mohammedu Buhari\'s candidacy was wholly bad and </p><p>incapable of generating support due to Buhari\'s </p><p>perceived Northern Moslem chauvinism. (Comment: Former </p><p>Babangida Foreign Minister Akinyemi told the </p><p>Ambassador in an aside before the meeting with </p><p>Adesanya that Babangida would win 40 percent of the </p><p>vote in the Southwest. While the old guard might </p><p>oppose Babangida, Akinyemi thought Babangida would be </p><p>supported by numbers of the younger-generation </p><p>politicians and the professional class. The extensive </p><p>network Babangida had developed and the favors doled </p><p>out over the years would help immensely in the </p><p>Southwest, Akinyemi thought. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Adesanya contended that any Southern </p><p>politician perceived as a front man for Northern </p><p>interests would have a difficult time gaining support </p><p>in the Southwest.  Reports that Alex Ekwueme was being </p><p>courted as a potential candidate by the Northern </p><p>establishment would hurt the esteemed Igbo in the </p><p>Southwest, Adesany gauged. The South, particularly the </p><p>Southwest, will no longer be duped by Northern </p><p>political maneuvering, Adesanya concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Senator Adesanya had the look and energy level </p><p>of a man a score or more younger than his eighty </p><p>years. (Adesanya recently celebrated his 80th </p><p>birthday.) Regarding President Obasanjo, Adesanya gave </p><p>a Yoruba perspective markedly different from that of </p><p>the Ooni of Ife\'s unabashed support for the President </p><p>(reftel).  While both men claim to represent the true </p><p>Yoruba perspective, the Ooni saw Obasanjo as </p><p>indispensable to Nigeria\'s stability; Adesanya said </p><p>Obasanjo could go but the Presidency must remain below </p><p>Nigeria\'s Mason-Dixon line, at least, for the next </p><p>presidential term. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (C) The point on which both the Ooni and Adesanya </p><p>agree is that Northern politicians are attempting to </p><p>recapture power in 2003.  Both men are allied in </p><p>asserting that the Yoruba Southwest will react </p><p>vehemently to this prospective retaking of political </p><p>power by the North.
