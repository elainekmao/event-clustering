<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002231 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR MILLS/CHANG </p><p>NSC/NEC FOR JASON SINGER </p><p>USUN FOR KONZET AND HILLMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETRD, EAID, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: LOCAL EXPORTERS FACE LOSSES FROM </p><p>SADDAM-ERA CONTRACTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 2159 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 1955 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Summary:  While the government meets with business </p><p>leaders to formulate a plan to mitigate the economic costs of </p><p>war in Iraq, local businesses are beginning to feel the </p><p>squeeze from the inability of the evaporating Saddam regime </p><p>to pay its bills.  Local exporters worry that a new Iraqi </p><p>government will not honor Saddam-era contracts, leaving them </p><p>holding the bag.  Balancing the need to offset real costs </p><p>incurred by Jordanian companies from the war against weaning </p><p>Jordan off of concessional trade relationships with its </p><p>neighbor will be a key consideration for the kingdom in a </p><p>post-war environment.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>Government Meets, Businesses Fret </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  King Abdullah has been meeting over the past two </p><p>weeks with senior representatives of all of Jordan\'s major </p><p>economic sectors, trade unions, and business associations to </p><p>gauge their losses from conflict in Iraq.  On April 1, PM </p><p>Abul Ragheb formed a special commission to study the issue </p><p>and prepare recommendations for the government to offset </p><p>those losses. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  As the government formulates a response, we have </p><p>begun to hear from business groups that have already felt, or </p><p>expect soon to feel, the economic consequences of war in </p><p>Iraq.  Irbid Chamber of Industry Chairman Maher al-Nasser </p><p>visited April 8 to voice concern over the exposure faced by </p><p>Jordanian companies trading under the Oil For Food program </p><p>and the bilateral oil and trade protocol with Iraq.  Nasser </p><p>said a number of companies are facing difficulties receiving </p><p>payments for goods delivered to Saddam Hussein\'s government, </p><p>while others were unable to deliver contracted goods and thus </p><p>could not present a delivery receipt to claim payment from </p><p>Jordan\'s Central Bank under the terms of the protocol.  This </p><p>second group of companies now has warehouses full of goods to </p><p>deliver, but no permission to make the trip to Baghdad and no </p><p>entity to receive the shipment in any case. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>GOJ Sticks to Its Legal Guns </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Nasser gave a list of companies facing </p><p>difficulties along with contract numbers to the Trade </p><p>Ministry.  This list estimates potential losses to 6 </p><p>companies of over $27 million (including $25 million in OFF </p><p>contracts and $2 million in protocol contracts).  In most of </p><p>these cases, the goods were contracted between Saddam\'s </p><p>government and the exporter, but applications to the OFF </p><p>program are either pending in committee or have not yet been </p><p>submitted.  According to Nasser, these companies are facing </p><p>increasingly stern demands from creditors to repay debts for </p><p>inputs that they accrued to manufacture the contracted goods. </p><p> This creates a "double whammy" of company failures due to </p><p>inability to move the goods, and increasing bad debt owed by </p><p>these companies to a handful of local banks.  We expect that </p><p>the Irbid-area companies listed by Nasser represent only a </p><p>fraction of companies country-wide facing similar losses. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  In an April 9 meeting with ECON Chief, Trade </p><p>Ministry Secretary General Farouk Hadidi said the GOJ is </p><p>ready to pay off any protocol contracts for which a receipt </p><p>can be produced as proof of delivery of goods to the </p><p>consignee in Iraq.  Any exporters who cannot provide proof of </p><p>delivery, though, will not be paid, he said, even if they can </p><p>produce a signed contract or L/C for the goods.  He said if </p><p>the GOJ started paying off these contracts for </p><p>undelivered/undeliverable goods, they would only open the </p><p>door to other abuses of the protocol and saddle the </p><p>government with a warehouse full of unsalable goods.  He </p><p>thought the GOJ would need to find other ways and resources </p><p>to meet these companies\' needs. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>A Plea for Assistance </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Nasser said that, for OFF contracts, Jordanians </p><p>would like to see a commitment from the UN to a) accept </p><p>applications for goods for which contracts had already been </p><p>signed between Saddam\'s government and the exporters; and b) </p><p>process those applications and pending applications </p><p>expeditiously, since for some of the companies these </p><p>contracts represent an entire year\'s worth of business.  For </p><p>protocol contracts, Nasser said the Chamber and individual </p><p>businesses will continue to try to work out a compensation </p><p>scheme with the GOJ.  As an alternative, Nasser said the </p><p>business community would appreciate assurances from the USG </p><p>that Saddam-era contracts would be honored and transactions </p><p>finalized with Jordanian exporters.  If that proved </p><p>impossible, Nasser hoped some other authority in Iraq would </p><p>honor these contracts instead. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (c)  Echoing remarks by FM Muasher to the Ambassador </p><p>April 8, Hadidi welcomed the decision to position UN OFF </p><p>inspectors from COTECNA in Aqaba.  He noted that Jordanian </p><p>OFF exporters would be incurring additional transportation </p><p>costs as a result of having to truck goods from northern </p><p>Jordan to Aqaba and back up to the Iraqi border (rather than </p><p>straight through as was previously the case), and asked if it </p><p>would be possible to put a "satellite" COTECNA office closer </p><p>to the Jordan-Iraq border to further facilitate the movement </p><p>of Jordanian goods into Iraq.  We told Hadidi we would pass </p><p>this request to Washington, and encouraged him to be in </p><p>direct contact with the Office of the Iraq Program and </p><p>COTECNA, which has a support office in Amman. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (c)  Nasser\'s questions raise the broader question of how </p><p>(or indeed, whether) a new government in Iraq will account </p><p>for obligations of Saddam\'s regime to Jordan and  Jordanian </p><p>companies. This applies not just to commercial contracts, but </p><p>more importantly to the continuation of the oil and trade </p><p>protocols, acknowledgment of Iraqi debt to Jordan, and </p><p>similar issues.  Several senior Jordanian officials have </p><p>raised their interest on the last point with the Ambassador. </p><p>They point out, for instance, that the current bilateral oil </p><p>and trade protocol expires at the end of December.  The </p><p>Ambassador has in response noted our mutual interest in </p><p>ending Jordan\'s economic dependence on concessional economic </p><p>relationships with Iraq. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
