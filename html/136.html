<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 00 ANKARA 09130 </p><p> </p><p>USINFO FOR P/M; EU; VOA-SMITH </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISTANBUL SYNAGOGUE ATTACK:  PRESS COVERAGE </p><p> </p><p>1.  THIS MESSAGE INCLUDES USIS CURRENT MEDIA REACTION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  IN PRESS COVERAGE, EDITORIALS AND PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENTS TURKISH REACTION TO THE BOMBING OF NEVE </p><p>SHALOM SYNAGOGUE IN ISTANBUL HAS BEEN ONE OF SHOCK AND </p><p>HORROR - AND CAUTION.  THE PRIME MINISTER "DAMNED" THE </p><p>ATTACK AS "BACKSTABBING," BUT THEN DECLARED THAT NO </p><p>EVIDENCE LINKED IT TO LIBYA AND WARNED ISRAEL AGAINST </p><p>RETALIATION.  THE PRESS HIGHLIGHTED CONDEMNATIONS OF </p><p>THE BOMBING BY THE PLO, LIBYA AND IRAN.  SPECULATION IS </p><p>RIFE, BUT FACTS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  PRESS COVERAGE OF THE ISTANBUL NEVE SHALOM </p><p>SYNAGOGUE ATTACK BEGAN ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 7 WITH FEW </p><p>FACTS OTHER THAN THOSE REPORTED IN THE WORLD PRESS. </p><p>AMID BLOODY PHOTOGRAPHS OF DISMEMBERED CORPSES, PAPERS </p><p>HEADLINED THEIR STORIES "LAKE OF BLOOD," "MASSACRE," </p><p>"MONSTROSITY," ETC.  THE TERRORISTS WERE IDENTIFIED AS </p><p>"ARABS" BY 17-YEAR OLD SURVIVOR GABRIEL SHAUL, WHO SAID </p><p>HE HEARD THEM SPEAKING ARABIC.  "MILLIYET" MADE THE </p><p>FOLLOWING SPECULATION:  "ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL </p><p>EVIDENCE, THE ATTACK ON THE SYNAGOGUE MIGHT BE AN </p><p>EXTENSION OF THE EVENTS IN KARACHI.  THE FACT THAT BOTH </p><p>OCCURRENCES USED THE SAME METHOD OF OPERATION </p><p>REINFORCES THIS OPINION.  EXPERTS ON TERRORISM DISCOUNT </p><p>THE POLICE\'S BELIEF THAT THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT </p><p>SOLELY BY TWO SUICIDE COMMANDOS."  THE PAPER ALSO </p><p>CARRIED A STATEMENT BY INTERIOR MINISTER YILDIRIM </p><p>AKBULUT THAT, "THE PRAYER HALL WAS 20 METERS BY 30. </p><p>THE TYPE OF BOMB THE TERRORISTS USED HAS AN EFFECTIVE </p><p>RANGE OF 50 METERS.  THEREFORE I CAN SAY THAT THE </p><p>TERRORISTS CERTAINLY CAME WITH THE AIM OF MOUNTING A </p><p>SUICIDE ATTACK."  ALL PAPERS NOTED THAT SATURDAY SAW </p><p>THE FIRST RELIGIOUS SERVICES HELD IN THE SYNAGOGUE </p><p>AFTER SIX MONTHS OF RENOVATION. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WITH THE FIRST NEWS CAME THE FIRST REACTIONS. </p><p>AFTER AN EMERGENCY CABINET MEETING, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ANNOUNCED ITS CONDEMNATION OF THE ACTION.  PRESIDENT </p><p>KENAN EVREN STATED, "AS A NATION WE REACT WITH PROFOUND </p><p>ABHORRENCE."  PRIME MINISTER TURGUT OZAL SENT A MESSAGE </p><p>TO TURKEY\'S CHIEF RABBI DAVID ASSEO REPORTEDLY </p><p>BEGINNING, "TURKEY VIOLENTLY DAMNS (SIC) THIS </p><p>BACKSTABBING ATTACK," AND ANNOUNCED, "IT IS </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE TO DO SUCH A THING TO THOSE PRAYING IN THE </p><p>HOUSE OF GOD."  SHP CHAIRMAN ERDAL INONU CALLED THE </p><p>EVENT "HORRIBLE," AND WARNED THE GOVERNMENT TO "ACT </p><p>SERIOUSLY," AS "CONDEMNATION IS NOT ENOUGH."  FORMER </p><p>PRIMIN ECEVIT IS QUOTED IN ALL PAPERS AS SAYING, "JUST </p><p>AS THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT THIS ACT HAVE NO RELATION TO </p><p>HUMANITY, THEY ALSO HAVE NO RELATION TO ISLAM, FOR </p><p>ISLAM DICTATES RESPECT FOR ALL RELIGIONS." </p><p> </p><p>5.  SUNDAY\'S "CUMHURIYET" INCLUDED A PAGE-1 STORY </p><p>ENTITLED "PLO CONDEMNS."  PLO ANKARA REPRESENTATIVE ABU </p><p>FIRAS RELEASED A STATEMENT FROM PLO NUMBER 2 MAN ABU </p><p>IYAD CONDEMNING THE ACTION AND ADDING, "THIS SORT OF </p><p>TERRORIST ACTION BENEFITS NO ONE BUT THE ZIONISTS." </p><p>THE PAPER ALSO CARRIED SHIMON PERES\' HOPE THAT "THE </p><p>TURKISH GOVERNMENT WILL DO ALL IT MUST TO FIND THE </p><p>KILLERS AND BRING THEM TO JUSTICE."  MEANWHILE, FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTRY OFFICIALS WERE QUOTED IN "HURRIYET" AS SAYING </p><p>THAT THERE WERE THREE POSSIBLE MOTIVES FOR THE ATTACK: </p><p>1)  A REACTION TO TURKEY\'S IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH </p><p>ISRAEL;  2)  THE ISLAMIC CIHAD TRYING TO SPREAD </p><p>INSTABILITY;  AND 3)  OPPOSITION TO ARAFAT\'S SOFTENING </p><p>THE PATRIARCHATE."  OKTAY EKSI, SEPT. 8 "HURRIYET": </p><p>THESE ACTS ARE WELL PLANNED, AND BEHIND THE PLANNERS </p><p>THERE ARE GREAT POWERS.  LOTS OF MONEY IS SPENT. </p><p>WITHOUT MAKING ANY CONNECTION TO THIS LAST EVENT, LET </p><p>ME SAY THAT JUST FOR THIS KIND OF ACTION THE CIA SPENT </p><p>$500 MILLION IN 1986... THE SYNAGOGUE HAD BEEN CLOSED </p><p>FOR SIX MONTHS;  THE FIRST IMPORTANT PRAYER AFTER THE </p><p>RENOVATION WAS THAT DAY.  IN OTHER WORDS, SOMEONE HAD </p><p>FOLLOWED DEVELOPMENTS AT THE SYNAGOGUE CLOSELY." </p><p> </p><p>10.  OTHER MEDIA REACTION: </p><p> </p><p>--  HALUK ULMAN OF HURRIYET (CIRC. 588,490 - MASS </p><p>APPEAL/INDEPENDENT), "THE LOGIC BEHIND THE MASSACRE": </p><p>" ... IN OTHER WORDS, THE RECENT U.S. CLAMOR AGAINST </p><p>LIBYA AIMS FOR \'DETERRENCE.\'  BUT EVIDENTLY IT IS FAR </p><p>FROM BEING SUCCESSFUL.  BECAUSE, AS IT WAS DEMONSTRATED </p><p>ONCE MORE, AND CONTRARY TO WHAT THE REAGAN </p><p>ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES, LIBYA DOES NOT HAVE THE </p><p>PRESUMED LEVEL OF INFLUENCE ON MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS....  ACCORDING TO INFORMATION RECEIVED, </p><p>THE PERPETRATORS OF BOTH THE PAN AM AND NEVE SHALOM </p><p>INCIDENTS ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS BASED IN LEBANON.  ONE OF THE REASONS </p><p>BEHIND THE FAILURE TO CURB VIOLENT INCIDENTS IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST IS THE EXISTENCE OF THE PALESTINE PROBLEM, </p><p>AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE CHAOS IN LEBANON.  ISRAEL HAD </p><p>TRIED TO FILL THAT VOID BY INVADING SOUTHERN LEBANON AND </p><p>TRYING TO ESTABLISH A PRO-ISRAELI ADMINISTRATION </p><p>THERE.  BUT IT FAILED, DESPITE THE SUPPORT FROM THE </p><p>U.S., AND WITHDREW.  LET\'S SEE WHAT THE ISRAELI </p><p>REACTION WILL BE.  IT WOULD NOT BE A SURPRISE IF </p><p>LEBANON-ISRAEL RELATIONS BECOME MUCH MORE NOISY </p><p>THAN AMERICAN-LIBYAN RELATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>-- ZAFER ATAY OF TERCUMAN (CIRC. 273,364 </p><p>-CONSERVATIVE), "THOSE BEHIND THE TERRORISM": </p><p>" ... IRAN SUPPORTS SHIITE-ORIGINATED </p><p>TERRORISM....   SYRIA IS THE GUARDIAN OF THE </p><p>SEPARATIST BANDITS, ASALA, ISLAMIC JIHAD; AND ABU </p><p>NIDAL....  THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT LIBYA IS ALSO IN </p><p>THIS....  I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION </p><p>THAT ALL THE RECENT TERRORIST INCIDENTS HAVE A </p><p>CONNECTION TO THE GREEK CYPRIOT SECTOR." </p><p> </p><p>-- TEOMAN EREL OF MILLIYET (CIRC. </p><p>255,822 -LIBERAL), "ARE WE READY FOR THE </p><p>CRISIS?":  " .... IT SEEMS THAT THE PERPETRATORS OF </p><p>THIS INHUMAN ATTACK RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM </p><p>MYSTERIOUS HELPERS LIVING IN TURKEY.  HOW DID THE </p><p>TERRORISTS KNOW THAT THE SYNAGOGUE WOULD BE OPEN ON </p><p>THE DAY OF THEIR ATTACK AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF </p><p>REPAIR?  ARE THERE PEOPLE WHO TRY TO COVER UP THE </p><p>WHOLE INCIDENT BY SAYING THAT \'THEY COMMITTED </p><p>SUICIDE, THERE WERE ONLY TWO PERSONS, AND ALSO </p><p>NOTHING MORE WAS FOUND,\' OR HAVE THOSE PEOPLE WHO </p><p>USED TO TELL THE STORY THAT TERRORISM WOULD ONLY </p><p>COME FROM THE LEFT, THOSE WHO BLAMED INONU AND THE </p><p>SHP EVEN FOR THE PKK (KURDISH SEPARATIST) </p><p>TERRORISM, FOUND THEMSELVES IN A DIFFICULT POSITION </p><p>NOW THAT THE NAME OF ISLAM IS INVOLVED IN AN </p><p>INCIDENT? ... WHILE WE ARE TRYING TO DOWNPLAY IT </p><p>FOR INTERNAL CONSUMPTION, WE MAY FOUND OURSELVES </p><p>IMMERSED IN THE \'NEW\' MIDDLE EAST CRISIS." </p><p> </p><p>- GUNERI CIVAOGLU OF GUNES (CIRC. </p><p>195,613 -POPULAR/FAMILY), "TERROR":  " ... IT IS </p><p>WRONG TO SEE TERRORISM AND THE STRUGGLE BY THE </p><p>STATE AGAINST IT AS ONLY A MATTER OF \'WEAPONS\' ... </p><p>AND \'POLICE MEASURES\'.  THIS KIND OF APPROACH CAN </p><p>ONLY BE IN THE SCRIPTS OF COWBOY FILMS....  THIS IS </p><p>A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL, BLOODY GAME, EXTENDING FROM </p><p>FULL-SCALE DEMOCRACY TO ALL THE YEARNING FOR </p><p>FREEDOMS ... ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, HOPES ... FOREIGN </p><p>CONNECTIONS AND AGENTS IN THE EVENTS ... ARMS </p><p>SMUGGLERS, MAFIA FATHERS, SECRET HANDS IN DRUG </p><p>TRAFFICKING." </p><p> </p><p>-- HASAN CEMAL OF CUMHURIYET (CIRC. 112, 673 -LEFT </p><p>OF CENTER), "WHAT CAN BE DONE?":  " ... WE SAY THAT </p><p>ALL THE POLITICAL POWERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONVERGE </p><p>ON THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR ON THE ISSUE OF </p><p>TERRORISM; THEY SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE NECESSITY FOR </p><p>SOLIDARITY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TYRANNY AND </p><p>VIOLENCE; THEY SHOULD START A REAL, CONSTRUCTIVE </p><p>DIALOGUE AMONG THEMSELVES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE." </p><p> </p><p>-- ERGUN BALCI OF CUMHURIYET, "SYNAGOGUE </p><p>MASSACRE":  " ... THE ATTACKS ON PAN AM AND THE </p><p>SYNAGOGUE IN ISTANBUL SEEM TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO </p><p>LEAD TO SERIOUS DEVELOPMENTS....  THE BOMBING OF </p><p>LIBYA BY THE U.S. MAY BE CONSIDERED CERTAIN IF </p><p>EVIDENCE OF LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE AFFAIR IS </p><p>FOUND.  AS A MATTER OF FACT, WASHINGTON DOES NOT </p><p>NEED EVIDENCE LIKE THIS IF IT HAD ALREADY DECIDED </p><p>TO BOMB LIBYA....  ISRAEL MAY RETALIATE AGAINST </p><p>SYRIA IN SIMILAR FASHION IF IT FOUND PROOF OF </p><p>SYRIAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE SYNAGOGUE AFFAIR.  IN </p><p>PARALLEL WITH THESE DEVELOPMENTS, INTENSIFICATION </p><p>OF ATTEMPTS TO PUSH TURKEY INTO A CRISIS AND TO </p><p>PULL TURKEY AND THE ARAB COUNTRIES AND PLO FURTHER </p><p>APART MAY BE EXPECTED.  A SERIES OF GLOOMY </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IS TAKING PLACE.  AND THIS IS ONLY THE </p><p>BEGINNING." </p><p> </p><p>--  MEHMET BARLAS OF MILLIYET REPORTED ON AN INTERVIEW </p><p>WITH PRIME MINISTER OZAL IN A COLUMN ENTITLED "THE AIM </p><p>IS TO PULL US INTO THE MIDDLE-EASTERN CRISIS," IN WHICH </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID THE </p><p>FOLLOWING:  " ... IF SOME STATES SUPPORT AND INCITE </p><p>TERRORISM, THIS MUST NOT BE TOLERATED.  TURKEY HAS </p><p>DECLARED ON MANY OCCASIONS THAT IT WILL NOT TOLERATE </p><p>THE ACTIONS OF THOSE STATES--IF THERE ARE ANY--WHICH </p><p>PERPETRATE TERRORISM ON TURKISH SOIL AND DIRECT IT AT </p><p>TURKISH CITIZENS.  FURTHERMORE, THOSE CIRCLES WHICH </p><p>HOPE TO PULL TURKEY INTO THE CONFLICTS OF THE </p><p>MIDDLE-EAST WILL CERTAINLY BE DISAPPOINTED....  TURKEY </p><p>WILL NOT FEEL DISPLEASURE IF MORE THAN ONE STATE, IN </p><p>LINE WITH THE UNITED NATIONS\' PRINCIPLES AND BASED ON </p><p>THE RIGHT OF SELF DEFENSE, CHOOSE TO ACT AGAINST THOSE </p><p>STATES WHICH SUPPORT AND INCITE TERRORISM". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STRAUSZ-HUPE </p><p></p></div>
