The GDP rose by 2 percent in 2002, which was lower than </p><p>economic growth rates in previous years of 2.7 percent in 2001 </p><p>and 4.8 percent in 2000.  Per capita income fell by 0.6 percent </p><p>during 2002, and the Consumer Price Index rose by 8 percent.  The </p><p>international reserves totaled USD 1.5 billion, and the gross </p><p>family remittances totaled USD 700 million.  The reference </p><p>exchange rate was 16.92 lempiras per dollar, which showed a </p><p>nominal depreciation of 6.3 percent for the year. Ref A contains </p><p>preliminary economic statistics for 2002. </p><p> </p><p>2003 Budget </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>2.   The 2003 budget adopted by Honduras\' National Congress in </p><p>December amounted to 60 billion lempiras (USD 3.5 billion).  The </p><p>Central Government was allocated 32 billion lempiras of the </p><p>budget and divided in the following order: 50 percent for social </p><p>expenditures, 13.6 percent for administration, 17.6 percent for </p><p>public debt service, 12.7 percent for the economic agencies, and </p><p>6.2 percent for security and defense.  Decentralized institutions </p><p>will receive 27.9 billion lempiras.  Taxes and other sources of </p><p>domestic income will fund 26.7 billion lempiras of the central </p><p>government budget.  Foreign assistance will provide the remaining </p><p>6.3 billion lempiras of the budget funding (4.8 billion lempiras </p><p>in loans and 1.5 billion lempiras in grants).  The GOH is </p><p>expected to submit amendments to the budget to Congress as part </p><p>of its fiscal package (due by the end of February).  Refs B and C </p><p>report on Honduran plans for new fiscal measures. </p><p> </p><p>GOH Housing Program Will Construct 30,000 Homes </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>3.   As part of its housing program, the GOH has set the goal to </p><p>construct 30,000 houses, worth 150,000 lempiras in 2003.  The </p><p>houses will go to low-income families and will be paid off over a </p><p>20-year period. </p><p> </p><p>GOH Eliminates the Commission for Privatization and Concessions </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.   The Commission for Privatization, which was created to </p><p>assist the government in privatizing public enterprises, has been </p><p>eliminated by the GOH.  The Vice-Minister of Finance explained </p><p>that the only successful operation of the Commission was </p><p>assisting in the concession to Interairports of international </p><p>airport operation.  He reported that both the Commission for </p><p>Privatization and the Commission for Modernization of the State </p><p>had overlapping jurisdictions. The decision was made to eliminate </p><p>the Commission for Privatization and allocate their task to the </p><p>Commission for Modernization. </p><p> </p><p>Growth in the Maquila Industry </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.   The Honduran Association of Assemblers for Export, an </p><p>organization that represents maquiladores, has reported a 4.5 </p><p>percent growth for the sector over the last year.  President </p><p>Maduro announced in January 2003, the maquila industry surpassed </p><p>its expected growth, with the creation of 8,000 jobs.  The growth </p><p>in jobs will come from new investment projects like cardboard, </p><p>stockings, chemicals, and electrical cables, which total USD 100 </p><p>million.  In the second quarter of 2003, a Taiwanese firm is </p><p>expected to construct a stockings factory. </p><p>Construction Sector Paralyzed Due to Higher Cost </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>6.   The Honduran Chamber of Construction has reported that 80 </p><p>percent of the sector is paralyzed due to higher prices of </p><p>materials and lack of funds to buy land.  The construction </p><p>industry currently employs more than 120,000 individuals compared </p><p>to the 600,000 it employed in the 1990\'s.  There is optimism </p><p>amongst leaders of the industry that new road and bridge projects </p><p>will induce growth, as well as GOH sponsored housing projects. </p><p> </p><p>Liquidation of Banco Capital </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.   The National Banking and Insurance Commission (CNBS) </p><p>liquidated Banco Capital and sold its deposit portfolio to Banco </p><p>Ficohsa on December 20, 2002, at an auction conducted by the </p><p>Deposit Insurance Fund.  The GOH is still working to sell off the </p><p>troubled loan portfolio of Banco Capital.  The GOH approved a </p><p>transfer of 517 million lempiras from Hondutel (the national </p><p>telephone enterprise) to guarantee the Capital deposits (full </p><p>report in Ref D). </p><p> </p><p>Sears Opens Store in Tegucigalpa </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.   Sears, Roebuck and Co. has invested close to USD 7 million </p><p>for the construction of its new facilities in Tegucigalpa and the </p><p>purchase of merchandise.  The company also intends to increase </p><p>the size of its operation in San Pedro Sula. </p><p> </p><p>Competition Forces Taca to Cut Prices Up to 50 percent </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>9.   Taca Airlines is now facing competition from Sol Air, a new </p><p>startup airline that offers service to Miami, Dallas, Honduras </p><p>and Nicaragua.  The loss of Taca Airline\'s monopoly on the </p><p>Central American airline market has forced the company to cut </p><p>prices up to 50 percent in order to stay competitive.  This has </p><p>benefited travelers to and from Honduras, who once paid USD 700 </p><p>and USD 800 and now pay USD 327 to USD 495.  Sol Air intends to </p><p>expand to other markets in Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, New </p><p>Orleans, and the Caribbean. </p><p> </p><p>Standard Fruit Company Announces New Investment for 2003 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  The GM of Standard Fruit Company in Honduras, Gerald </p><p>Brunelle, announced planned new investment of USD 11.7 million. </p><p>The money will be used in banana and pineapple production on the </p><p>Honduran Atlantic Coast.  The project will be completed within </p><p>two years, and Standard Fruit will hire an additional 1,100 </p><p>employees.  Total exports from this investment will be USD 17-18 </p><p>million for pineapples and bananas. </p><p> </p><p>AES Contract Approved </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  On January 31, the National Congress approved a contract </p><p>between the American-owned electrical company, AES of Honduras </p><p>and Honduran state-owned ENEE. The contract will provide the </p><p>incentive to build a USD 650 million power plant that would </p><p>provide 200 megawatts of electricity to both Honduras and El </p><p>Salvador.  AES expects to make a profit of USD 500 million over </p><p>12 years with additional profits coming from energy sales in El </p><p>Salvador.  The contract will become effective upon signature by </p><p>President Maduro and publication in the Gazeta. (See Refs E and F </p><p>for background on contract). </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
