<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005751 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/03/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, JA, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JAPANESE DIPLOMAT REPORTS BAGHDAD NORMAL, BASRA </p><p>BUSTLING, AND MFA HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT DIRECTOR COMING TO </p><p>THE REGION </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 5490 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Baghdad, Basra and Points In Between </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) On October 2, a source in the Japanese Embassy\'s Iraq </p><p>Division provided A/Polcouns a readout of his recently </p><p>completed three week visit to Iraq.  The source had been in </p><p>Iraq from September 7 to 27 and had traveled from Baghdad to </p><p>Basra and back by car September 14-16.  Overall, he said that </p><p>the atmosphere throughout the country was "remarkably </p><p>normal."  He didn\'t perceive any noticeable difference in </p><p>Baghdad from his last visit in June.  The security presence </p><p>in the city was unchanged from earlier in the summer </p><p>(offering a different impression from that of USINT Chief </p><p>Bernacki (ref)) and Baghdad\'s hotels were full of foreign </p><p>visitors (including a Japanese musical troupe -- a first, he </p><p>noted), there for the Babylon festival. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On his trip to the south, he said he was surprised by </p><p>the relatively good condition and bustle of Basra.  He had </p><p>expected to see a "devastated city."  Instead, he found a </p><p>city "full of street traffic and souks quite full of goods." </p><p>He saw no obvious military presence in the city during the </p><p>day he was there.  These impressions were very different, he </p><p>noted, from those he had of a trip to Mosul earlier in the </p><p>year where he had found streetlife comparatively quiet and </p><p>the military/security presence much stronger. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The 9/14-9/16 trip south took him through Karbala and </p><p>Najaf enroute to Basra and via Misan and Kut on the way back. </p><p> Karbala and Najaf, like Basra, were full of people -- both </p><p>Iraqis and Iranian pilgrims.  All the shops were open even </p><p>though the day they passed through both cities was a Friday. </p><p>The one area where he said he encountered an overt military </p><p>presence was "in the middle of Misan province" where he saw </p><p>quite a number of soldiers. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>Upcoming Regional Visit of Japanese MFA Humanitarian Chief </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On the issue of preparations for any possible U.S. </p><p>military action against Iraq, he told A/Polcouns that Tokyo </p><p>is dispatching a Mr. Kawakami, Director of the International </p><p>Humanitarian Support Division of the Japanese MFA, to the </p><p>region to assess potential needs and how Japan could help </p><p>address them.  Kawakami will arrive in Jordan from Syria on </p><p>October 12 and then depart to Israel on October 14.  While in </p><p>Amman he intends to meet with officials from the MFA, the </p><p>Ministry of Interior, and possibly the GID.  Kawakami will be </p><p>in Geneva October 7-8 to discuss Tokyo\'s humanitarian </p><p>strategy in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia with </p><p>Japanese diplomats from posts in those regions, and with </p><p>Geneva-based humanitarian agencies. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
