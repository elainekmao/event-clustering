(U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR JAMES BRUNO; </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: THE FIERCE JOCKEYING AMONG THE COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY (CPV) LEADERSHIP THAT PEAKED AT THE APRIL 19-22 NINTH </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS HAS BEEN BUILDING FOR MONTHS.  (REFTELS </p><p>DETAIL OUR EXPECTATION THAT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER MANH </p><p>WILL BE CROWNED AS THE NEW CPV GENERAL SECRETARY ON APRIL </p><p>22.)  THE IN-FIGHTING THAT HAS LED TO THE ECLIPSE OF </p><p>INCUMBENT PHIEU HAS BECOME PARTICULARLY FEVERISH SINCE </p><p>OCTOBER, WHEN THE THREE SENIOR ADVISORS CIRCULATED A LETTER </p><p>RECOMMENDING HE STEP DOWN FOR POOR AND UNEVEN LEADERSHIP. </p><p>OVER THIS PERIOD, THE EMBASSY HAS CONTINUED TO TRACK THE </p><p>PUBLIC APPEARANCES OF THE POLITBURO IN VIETNAMESE OFFICIAL </p><p>MEDIA, AND THESE ACCOUNTS GIVE US INSIGHTS ABOUT HOW THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP "CAMPAIGN" HAS BEEN PLAYED OUT.  IN RETROSPECT, </p><p>WE CAN SEE THAT PHIEU MADE A FURIOUS EFFORT, UNSUCCESSFUL </p><p>IN THE END, TO "BARNSTORM" THE COUNTRY BY VISITING KEY </p><p>PROVINCIAL PARTY LEADERS TO RALLY SUPPORT. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) SUMMARY (CONT\'D): AS NOTED IN EARLIER REPORTS </p><p>DRAWING ON OUR YEAR-LONG TRACKING PROJECT, ROUGHLY HALF OF </p><p>THE POLITBURO -- INCLUDING "THE ONCE AND FUTURE LEADERS" </p><p>WHO SEEM THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR THE NEXT GENERATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00952  01 OF 06  201134Z </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY, PRIME MINISTER AND PRESIDENT -- HAVE </p><p>HIGHLY VISIBLE PUBLIC ROLES.  THE OTHER HALF OF THIS </p><p>POWERFUL BODY, HOWEVER, CONTINUES TO OPERATE IN THE </p><p>SHADOWS, SHIELDED FROM PUBLIC VIEW.  THIS CABLE PROVIDES A </p><p>SNAPSHOT OF VIETNAM\'S NEW LEADERSHIP, WHICH COMES OUT OF </p><p>THE OLD POLITBURO; SUMMARIZES OUR TRACKING OF THE </p><p>INCUMBENTS OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS; AND INCLUDES IN-DEPTH </p><p>"PUBLIC PROFILES" OF OUTGOING GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU AND </p><p>HIS EVIDENT SUCCESSOR MANH.  (SEPTEL WILL PROFILE THE </p><p>REMAINING 16 MEMBERS OF THE POLITBURO.)  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>SNAPSHOT OF VIETNAM\'S NEW LEADERSHIP </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ON APRIL 21 THE DELEGATES TO THE NINTH COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY CONGRESS WILL FORMALLY CAST THEIR VOTES FOR A NEW </p><p>150-MEMBER CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  AS DETAILED REFTELS, </p><p>HOWEVER, THE DECISIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE, AND WHEN THE </p><p>RESULTS ARE ANNOUNCED OFFICIALLY APRIL 22, NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY SPEAKER NONG DUC MANH IS WIDELY ASSUMED TO BE </p><p>CONFIRMED AS THE NEW CPV GENERAL SECRETARY REPLACING LE KHA </p><p>PHIEU.  FOLLOWING THE OPENING SESSION OF THE CONGRESS APRIL </p><p>19, PHIEU GRANTED A RARE IMPROMPTU INTERVIEW TO THE REUTERS </p><p>CORRESPONDENT, VIRTUALLY CONFIRMING HE WAS STEPPING DOWN TO </p><p>MAKE WAY FOR YOUNGER LEADERSHIP.  (VIRTUALLY ALL OUR </p><p>SOURCES CONFIRM MANH\'S ELEVATION.)  ALSO NOTABLE IN PHIEU\'S </p><p>COMMENTS WAS HIS MENTION THAT NEITHER HE NOR THE THREE </p><p>CURRENT "SENIOR ADVISORS" -- FORMER GENERAL SECRETARY DO </p><p>MUOI, FORMER PRESIDENT LE DUC ANH, AND FORMER PM VO VAN </p><p>KIET -- WOULD SERVE AS SENIOR ADVISORS.  TWO SOURCES TELL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00952  01 OF 06  201134Z </p><p>US SEPARATELY THAT MANH ONLY AGREED TO TAKE THE JOB IF </p><p>THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY SENIOR ADVISORS LOOKING OVER HIS AND </p><p>THE REST OF THE POLITBURO\'S SHOULDERS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) REFTELS DETAIL THE LIKELY NEW ENTRIES TO THE </p><p>POLITBURO -- INCLUDING CPV MASS MOBILIZATION HEAD TRUONG </p><p>QUANG DUOC AND FORMER LABOR MINISTER NGUYEN DINH HOAN -- AS </p><p>WELL AS THE LIKELY RETIREMENT OF SEVEN PRIMARILY OLDER AND </p><p>LARGELY CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS.  (DEPUTY PM CAM IS A </p><p>REFORMIST EXCEPTION AMONG THOSE RETIRING, BUT EXPECTED </p><p>RETIREES PHIEU, HO CHI MINH POLITICAL ACADEMY HEAD BINH, </p><p>FATHERLAND FRONT HEAD DUYET, HANOI PARTY CHIEF TUNG AND </p><p>ARMED FORCES POLITICAL COMMISSAR NGAN ALL HAVE BEEN AMONG </p><p>THE CURRENT IDEOLOGICAL OR THE STABILITY-FIRST-REFORM- </p><p>SECOND CAMPS.)  IN ADDITION, THE NEW LEADERSHIP WILL HAVE </p><p>AN ENHANCED ROLE FOR TRADE MINISTER VU KHOAN, SET TO SERVE </p><p>AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER OVERSEEING FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND </p><p>TRADE ISSUES (NGUYEN MANH CAM\'S OLD POSITION) AND REPORTED </p><p>TO MOVE INTO AN IMPORTANT COORDINATING POSITION AS HEAD OF </p><p>THE RECONSTITUTED POLITBURO SECRETARIAT.  (COMMENT: ONE OF </p><p>THE MOST CAPABLE AND PRAGMATIC "REFORMERS" IN THE CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE, VU KHOAN OF COURSE WAS KEY TO SIGNING OF THE </p><p>BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S.  HIS ELEVATION TO A </p><p>POSITION OF GREATER INFLUENCE OVERALL CPV DECISION-MAKING </p><p>CAN ENHANCE THE REFORMIST CAUSE.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) ALL IN ALL, THESE CHANGES ADD UP TO A MORE </p><p>STREAMLINED LEADERSHIP THAT PROMISES TO BE MORE </p><p>PROFESSIONAL AND EFFICIENT.  SEVERAL FACTORS WILL </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO THIS: MANH, A PRAGMATIC MODERATE, HAS MUCH </p><p>BETTER SKILLS AS AN ADMINISTRATOR THAN PHIEU.  HE IS WIDELY </p><p>RESPECTED (INCLUDING AMONG HIS STRONGLY REFORM-MINDED MID- </p><p>LEVEL STAFF) FOR HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE ASSEMBLY OVER THE </p><p>PAST DECADE, DURING WHICH HE DEMONSTRATED HIS SKILLS AS A </p><p>COALITION BUILDER.  HE HAS SPENT THE PAST DECADE HELPING </p><p>GUIDE THE ASSEMBLY AS IT HAS ASSUMED AN INCREASINGLY </p><p>IMPORTANT ROLE IN CRAFTING LEGISLATION TO MEET NEW DEMANDS </p><p>AS VIETNAM HAS SHIFTED MORE TOWARD MARKET PRINCIPLES. </p><p>PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, IF THE SENIOR ADVISORS INDEED ARE </p><p>EXCLUDED FROM THE SCENE, THIS WILL BE A HUGE ADVANCE IN </p><p>ALLOWING THE POLITBURO TO FUNCTION MORE AS A MODERN PARTY </p><p>POLICY APPARATUS WITH MANH AS CEO. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ANOTHER KEY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE MILITARY LOOKS TO </p><p>HAVE ITS LOWEST SENIOR PROFILE IN MEMORY, PERHAPS EVER IN </p><p>THE HISTORY OF INDEPENDENT VIETNAM.  IF, AS LOOKS LIKELY, </p><p>DEFENSE MINISTER TRA WILL BE LEFT AS THE SOLE MILITARY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE ON A LEANER 15-MEMBER POLITBURO, THE </p><p>MILITARY\'S ABILITY TO WEIGH IN WITH "NATIONAL SECURITY" </p><p>ARGUMENTS FOR GOING SLOW ON REFORM AND GUARDING AGAINST </p><p>FOREIGN THREATS WILL BE MUCH LESS THAN HISTORICALLY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00952  02 OF 06  201135Z </p><p>FURTHERMORE, TRA IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENED PERSONALLY </p><p>FOLLOWING HIS SEVERE CENSURE BY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>EARLIER THIS MONTH FOR MISMANAGEMENT, IN PART BECAUSE OF </p><p>THE VIOLATION OF VIETNAMESE AIR SPACE BY VIETNAMESE- </p><p>AMERICAN ANTI-SRV ACTIVIST LY TONG.  (NOTE: IT APPEARS </p><p>PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTER HUONG WILL ALSO REMAIN IN THE </p><p>POLITBURO.  END NOTE.) IN ADDITION, THOUGH THIS HAS NEVER </p><p>BEEN PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED, SEVERAL SOURCES REPORT THAT </p><p>PART OF PHIEU\'S DOWNFALL -- AND THE CENSURE OF TRA AND ARMY </p><p>CHIEF OF STAFF DUNG -- OWED TO HIS MISUSE OF MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ASSETS TO EAVESDROP ON HIS POLITBURO AND </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE PEERS.  ANGER BY CENTRAL COMMITTEE </p><p>COLLEAGUES UPON DISCOVERY OF THIS REPORTED CAMPAIGN, </p><p>RUMORED TO BE A WEAPON IN PHIEU\'S CRITICISM/SELF-CRITICISM </p><p>INITIATIVE, MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE MILITARY\'S </p><p>WEAKENED LEADERSHIP PROFILE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>THE NEW LEADERSHIP GROWS OUT OF THE OLD: </p><p>"PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FACES" OF POLITBURO PRIOR TO CONGRESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) AS THE NEW VIETNAMESE LEADERSHIP IS UNVEILED THIS </p><p>WEEKEND, IT IS AN INSTRUCTIVE MOMENT TO ANALYZE WHAT </p><p>BROUGHT ABOUT THESE CHANGES.  SINCE THE POLITBURO IS SUCH </p><p>AN OPAQUE AND SECRETIVE BODY -- AND SUSPICION OF THE U.S. </p><p>CONTINUES TO RUN HIGH, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE SECURITY- </p><p>MINDED MINISTRIES AND CPV CADRE -- WE OFTEN OBTAIN ONLY </p><p>INDIRECT INSIGHTS INTO THE WORKINGS OF THIS GROUP.  AS PART </p><p>OF THE EMBASSY\'S ONGOING TRACKING PROJECT OF THE PUBLIC </p><p>FACES OF THE POLITBURO IN THE VIETNAMESE MEDIA OVER THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00952  02 OF 06  201135Z </p><p>PAST YEAR, WE HAVE CONTINUED TO TALLY HOW FREQUENTLY AND IN </p><p>WHAT MANNER VIETNAM\'S MAJOR DAILY PAPERS TRACK THE </p><p>APPEARANCES OF THE MOST SENIOR COMMUNIST PARTY (CPV) </p><p>MEMBERS.  (IN PARTICULAR WE EXAMINED THE CPV MOUTHPIECE </p><p>"THE PEOPLE" AND TWO LEADING DAILIES IN THE LARGEST CITIES: </p><p>"NEW HANOI" AND "SAIGON LIBERATION."  WHILE NOT A </p><p>COMPREHENSIVE LISTING, THIS GIVES US A GOOD SURVEY OF HOW </p><p>THE LEADERSHIP IS FEATURED IN THE MOST PROMINENT OFFICIAL </p><p>PUBLICATIONS.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS, FROM OCTOBER 1, 2000-MARCH </p><p>31, 2001, IN THE RUN-UP TO THE NINTH COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>CONGRESS, WE CONTINUED TO SEE THE SAME TRENDS ORIGINALLY </p><p>DOCUMENTED PREVIOUSLY: ROUGHLY HALF OF THE POLITBURO HAVE </p><p>POSITIONS WITH LARGELY "PUBLIC" FACES THAT INVOLVE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT APPEARANCES IN THE PUBLIC EYE.  THE OTHER HALF </p><p>WORKS LARGELY IN POSITIONS DEALING WITH INTERNAL CPV </p><p>AFFAIRS AND REGULAR FROM REGULAR PUBLIC EXPOSURE.  THUS, </p><p>TRACKING THE PUBLIC APPEARANCES OF THE POLITBURO IN THE </p><p>STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA GIVES ONLY AN INCOMPLETE, PARTIAL </p><p>VIEW OF THE ACTIVITIES AND IMPORTANCE OF SENIOR LEADERS. </p><p>BUT IT REVEALS HOW THE CPV WISHES TO CONVEY ITSELF TO ITS </p><p>PUBLIC, AND THUS IS A USEFUL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IN </p><p>ANALYZING THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEADERSHIP </p><p>ELITE. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) DURING THIS PERIOD, NOT SURPRISINGLY, AMONG THE </p><p>MOST PROMINENTLY FEATURED POLITBURO FIGURES IN THE MEDIA </p><p>WERE THE TOP FIVE OFFICIALS WHO CONSTITUTE THE STANDING </p><p>COMMITTEE.  EACH OF THEM HAS AN IMPORTANT "PUBLIC </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY" REPRESENTING THE CPV AND THE GOVERNMENT: </p><p>CPV GENERAL SECRETARY PHIEU, PRESIDENT LUONG, PRIME </p><p>MINISTER KHAI, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER MANH, AND </p><p>FATHERLAND FRONT CHAIR DUYET.  IN ADDITION, FIRST DEPUTY </p><p>PRIME MINISTER DUNG, HANOI PARTY CHIEF TRONG, HO CHI MINH </p><p>CITY PARTY CHIEF TRIET AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER CAM ALSO </p><p>MAINTAINED PROMINENT PUBLIC PROFILES IN THE MEDIA.  OF ALL </p><p>OF THESE MENTIONED ABOVE, THEIR PUBLIC PROFILE REFLECTS </p><p>GENERALLY THEIR RELATIVE CLOUT AS AMONG THE KEY "PLAYERS" </p><p>IN THE CPV LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNMENT.  DEPUTY PM CAM IS </p><p>PERHAPS THE ONE EXCEPTION.  AS DEPUTY PM OVERSEEING FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS AND TRADE ISSUES, HIS PUBLIC PROFILE IS DRIVEN BY </p><p>FOREIGN VISITORS.  HE ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL RETIRE AT THE </p><p>CPV CONGRESS. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) MOST ALL OF THE LEADERS MENTIONED ABOVE HAVE </p><p>FIGURED PROMINENTLY IN THE JOCKEYING OVER THE PAST MONTHS </p><p>FOR A SPOT IN THE NEW SLATE OF LEADERS TO BE APPROVED AT </p><p>THE CONGRESS -- PHIEU, MANH, LUONG, TRONG, DUNG AND TRIET. </p><p>IN FACT, ONLY ONE OTHER POLITBURO MEMBER APPEARS TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN CONSIDERED FOR A POSSIBLE SENIOR POSITION WHO IS NOT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00952  03 OF 06  201135Z </p><p>IN THIS "PUBLIC GROUP": CPV ORGANIZATIONAL AFFAIRS CHIEF </p><p>NGUYEN VAN AN.  AN, A FINALIST WHO LOST OUT TO PHIEU FOR </p><p>THE TOP JOB IN 1997, HAS REMAINED LARGELY IN THE SHADOWS </p><p>SINCE THEN.  IN THE ENDGAME TO SUCCEED PHIEU, HE AGAIN </p><p>PROVED TO BE THE MAIN ALTERNATIVE.  AT THE PRE-CONGRESS </p><p>MEETING APRIL 16 HE REPORTEDLY RECEIVED SERIOUS </p><p>CONSIDERATION FOR THE POST AFTER MANH INITIALLY DEMURRED. </p><p>(IN THE END, MANH APPARENTLY DID SO FOR TACTICAL REASONS, </p><p>IN PART TO SECURE THE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL SENIOR ADVISORS </p><p>FROM THE SCENE.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>PHIEU BARNSTORMED TO TRY TO SAVE HIS SKIN ... </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) LE KHA PHIEU, 69, HAS SERVED AS GENERAL SECRETARY </p><p>SINCE DECEMBER 1997.  A YEAR AGO HE SEEMED FIRMLY ENSCONCED </p><p>IN HIS POSITION AND LOOKED TO HAVE CONSOLIDATED POWER WITH </p><p>THE AID OF FORMER PRESIDENT ANH, HIMSELF A MILITARY MAN. </p><p>HOWEVER, ANH AND THE OTHER SENIOR ADVISORS TURNED AGAINST </p><p>PHIEU, OWING TO HIS POOR MANAGEMENT OF CPV AFFAIRS AND </p><p>MISCUES ON ECONOMIC REFORM AND RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND THE </p><p>U.S., AS WELL AS RUMORED MISUSE OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE </p><p>AGAINST HIS CPV SENIOR COLLEAGUES.  PHIEU ALSO MAY HAVE </p><p>OVERREACHED BY TRYING TO COMBINE THE PRESIDENCY WITH THE </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY POST -- A COMBINATION THAT WOULD HAVE </p><p>DISRUPTED THE TRADITIONAL, CAREFULLY BALANCED ARRANGEMENT </p><p>AMONG THE THREE TOP LEADERS REPRESENTING VIETNAM\'S THREE </p><p>REGIONS AND ALSO DIFFERENT POLICY LINES AND ORGANIZATIONAL </p><p>ENTITIES (CPV, MILITARY, GOVERNMENT).  THE COUP DE GRACE </p><p>MAY WELL HAVE BEEN HIS CALLING FOR ELIMINATING THE SENIOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00952  03 OF 06  201135Z </p><p>ADVISOR POSITIONS.  (IRONICALLY, IT APPEARS MANH WILL BE </p><p>SUCCESSFUL WHERE PHIEU FAILED, WITH THE SENIOR ADVISORS </p><p>AGREEING TO STEP BACK.  IN ADDITION, RUMORS CIRCULATE APRIL </p><p>20 THAT MANH ALSO MAY HAVE BEEN OFFERED THE TWO CONCURRENT </p><p>POSTS OF PRESIDENT AND GENERAL SECRETARY, WITH CURRENT </p><p>PRESIDENT LUONG RUMORED TO BE MOVING OVER TO NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY CHAIR.  WHILE POSSIBLE, WE DOUBT THIS WILL TAKE </p><p>PLACE AT THIS TIME.) </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU) IN OUR TRACKING SURVEY OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS, </p><p>PHIEU WAS FEATURED ON 79 DIFFERENT DATES IN PAGE ONE </p><p>ARTICLES IN THE MEDIA, AND BEFITTING HIS POSITION AS THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S MOST POWERFUL FIGURE, HE WAS DEPICTED LEADING THE </p><p>CPV AND NATION IN ITS POLITICAL LIFE.  ONE OF THE STRIKING </p><p>THINGS WE NOTE FROM OUR TRACKING PROJECT IS HOW ACTIVE </p><p>PHIEU WAS OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS IN "BARNSTORMING" THE </p><p>COUNTRY, VISITING LOCAL PARTY CONGRESSES IN FAR-FLUNG </p><p>PROVINCES AND ALL THE COUNTRY\'S MAJOR CITIES.  SOURCES TELL </p><p>US THIS HAS BEEN A KEY PART OF PHIEU\'S STRATEGY IN RALLYING </p><p>SUPPORT TO RESIST THE CAMPAIGN OF THE THREE SENIOR </p><p>ADVISORS, ANH, MUOI AND KIET, TO HAVE HIM STEP DOWN.  (OF </p><p>COURSE, THE LETTER OF THE SENIOR ADVISORS AND OTHER </p><p>BACKROOM POLITICKING THAT WOULD BE A STAPLE OF POLITICAL </p><p>REPORTING IN WASHINGTON, BANGKOK OR MANILA HAS NEVER BEEN </p><p>MENTIONED IN VIETNAMESE STATE-RUN MEDIA.  THE FOREIGN </p><p>CORRESPONDENTS BASED HERE HAVE REPORTED WIDELY ON THIS, OF </p><p>COURSE.) </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) AMONG OTHER CPV GATHERINGS, PHIEU WAS FEATURED </p><p>PROMINENTLY IN "THE PEOPLE" GIVING KEYNOTE ADDRESSES TO THE </p><p>PARTY CONGRESSES FOR KEY ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY\'S GENERAL POLICE DEPARTMENT </p><p>(NOV. 8), THE CPV CONGRESSES FOR MILITARY REGIONS 3 (NOV. </p><p>13) AND 5 (NOV. 21), AND THE CIVIL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION </p><p>(NOV. 28).  HIS KEYNOTE ADDRESSES OPENING AND CLOSING EACH </p><p>OF THE CPV CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUMS WERE REPRINTED IN THE </p><p>STATE MEDIA.  PHIEU WAS DEPICTED MEETING PRESIDENT CLINTON </p><p>NOV. 18, AND VIETNAMESE MEDIA WENT TO UNPRECEDENTED EFFORTS </p><p>TO DESCRIBE PHIEU\'S MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, INCLUDING </p><p>HIS STRIDENT DEFENSE OF SOCIALISM, WHICH PROVED TO BE ONE </p><p>OF THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE BROAD CRITICISM OF </p><p>PHIEU, PARTICULARLY FROM REFORMERS IN THE CPV. </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) PHIEU WAS ALSO FEATURED ADDRESSING PROVINCIAL </p><p>PARTY CONGRESSES AROUND THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING THOSE IN HA </p><p>GIANG IN THE FAR NORTH (DEC. 4), HO CHI MINH CITY (DEC. </p><p>19), HANOI (DEC. 28), NINH BINH AND THANH HOA (JAN. 2), </p><p>AMONG MANY OTHERS.  PHIEU ALSO ADDRESSED THE NATIONAL </p><p>MILITARY CONGRESS AND WAS AWARDED A GOLDEN STAR MEDAL BY </p><p>THE PAVN GENERAL POLITICAL DEPARTMENT, WHICH HE FORMERLY </p><p>HEADED.  IN ADDITION, PHIEU TRAVELED AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00952  04 OF 06  201136Z </p><p>MANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONAL FUNCTIONS; HE VISITED FLOODED </p><p>AN GIANG PROVINCE IN THE MEKONG DELTA IN EARLY OCTOBER AND </p><p>FLOODED REGIONS OF HCMC AT THE END OF THE MONTH.  HE MET </p><p>MANY OTHER VISITING DIGNITARIES, RANGING FROM THE ALGERIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT (OCT. 16), A VISITING CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>DELEGATION ATTENDING A WORKSHOP ON SOCIALISM (NOV. 11), THE </p><p>INDIAN PRIME MINISTER (JAN. 9), THE PRC DEFENSE MINISTER </p><p>(FEB. 9), THE CUBAN FOREIGN MINISTER (FEB. 24), AND RUSSIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT PUTIN (MARCH 2).  IN SUM, PHIEU MAINTAINED AN </p><p>ACTIVE PUBLIC SCHEDULE, PARTICULARLY WHEN ONE NOTES HIS </p><p>NURTURING OF KEY CPV ALLIES IN THE MILITARY, PUBLIC </p><p>SECURITY AND PARTY CADRE AREAS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>... WHILE MANH\'S ONGOING NETWORKING MADE ALLIES OVER TIME </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN NONG DUC MANH, 60, IN </p><p>CONTRAST TO PHIEU, SEEMS TO HAVE SLOWLY AND STEADILY </p><p>DEVELOPED A BROAD NETWORK OF ADMIRERS AND SUPPORTERS IN </p><p>SENIOR CPV RANKS.  IN THE END, HIS STRONG SUPPORT AMONG THE </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE DECISIVE FACTOR </p><p>IN BRINGING HIM TO HIS LIKELY "CORONATION" APRIL 22 AS THE </p><p>NEW GENERAL SECRETARY.  CONTRASTED WITH HIS PREDECESSORS </p><p>PHIEU, DO MUOI, TRUONG CHINH AND LE DUAN, WHO USED EITHER </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY OR MILITARY CREDENTIALS TO REACH THE TOP </p><p>SPOT, MANH\'S PATH TO THE SEAT OF POWER WAS BUILT PATIENTLY </p><p>THROUGH HIS WORK AS HEAD OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SINCE </p><p>1992.  TRADITIONALLY, THE ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN A WEAK </p><p>RUBBERSTAMP IN VIETNAMESE POLITICS, BUT MANH PRESIDED OVER </p><p>A PERIOD OF THE ASSEMBLY\'S ASSUMING MUCH GREATER PROMINENCE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  00952  04 OF 06  201136Z </p><p>AS A MORE GENUINELY DELIBERATIVE BODY.  ON OCCASION THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY HAS BUCKED THE POLITBURO\'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND </p><p>PRESSED FOR THE SACKING OF NOMINATED CANDIDATES DEEMED </p><p>INCOMPETENT.  ALSO DURING HIS TENURE THE ASSEMBLY BEGAN </p><p>LIVE QUESTIONING OF MINISTERS ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND </p><p>VIGOROUSLY DEBATED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES, WITH MEMBERS </p><p>STRONGLY DEFENDING THE INTERESTS OF THEIR LOCAL </p><p>CONSTITUENTS.  IF ANYTHING, MANH\'S PUBLIC VISIBILITY AND </p><p>THE ROLE HE WAS PLAYING TO MEET PUBLIC INTERESTS ENHANCED </p><p>HIS RECOGNITION IN LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS PUBLIC CIRCLES. </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) MANH\'S SMOOTH STYLE OF MANAGING THE ASSEMBLY -- </p><p>BUSINESS-LIKE AND COMMITTED TO BUILDING BROAD COALITIONS </p><p>AMONG THE CPV\'S DISPARATE FACTIONS AND SECTORAL GROUPS </p><p>REPRESENTED IN THE FATHERLAND FRONT -- HAS WON HIGH MARKS. </p><p>HIS STRONG "CORRIDOR REPUTATION" IN THE HALLS OF THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN BUILT PATIENTLY OVER A DECADE OF WORK; </p><p>CONSISTENTLY OVER THE PAST YEAR HE HAS POLLED AMONG THE </p><p>MOST RESPECTED MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  ONE KEY </p><p>LIEUTENANT AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SAYS MANH IS "DEVOTED, </p><p>WORK-ORIENTED AND CLEAN," WITHOUT THE CORRUPTION </p><p>ALLEGATIONS HANGING OVER HIM THAT OTHERS (INCLUDING PHEIU) </p><p>HAVE FACED RECENTLY.  MANH REPORTEDLY IS A "GOOD LISTENER," </p><p>AND WE HAVE NOTED HE IS AN ENGAGING INTERLOCUTOR FOR </p><p>VISITING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.  MANH\'S LIEUTENANT SAYS HIS </p><p>MENTOR, HOWEVER, MAY NOT HAVE DEEP SUPPORT FROM KEY </p><p>FACTIONS IN THE CPV\'S SENIOR RANKS -- THOUGH HE COMMANDS </p><p>BROAD SUPPORT -- AND THIS COULD COMPLICATE HIS EARLY TIME </p><p>IN OFFICE.  A DEPUTY HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITIES COMISSION, WHO FORMERLY WORKED FOR MANH, SAID HE </p><p>IS PRAGMATIC, COLLABORATIVE AND RESPECTFUL OF OTHERS, AND </p><p>THESE PERSONAL TRAITS ARE PART OF THE SOURCE OF HIS APPEAL. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) DURING THE OCTOBER-MARCH PERIOD, MANH WAS </p><p>FEATURED 53 TIMES IN THE THREE KEY VIETNAMESE PRESS ORGANS </p><p>WE ANALYZED.  ON NOVEMBER 14 HE OPENED THE FALL SESSION OF </p><p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, PRESIDING OVER THE BODY\'S BUSINESS </p><p>UNTIL ITS RECESS DECEMBER 9.  THE FALL SESSION PRIMARILY </p><p>FOCUSED ON DISCUSSION AND APPROVAL OF THE 2001 BUDGET AND </p><p>SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLAN, THOUGH LIKE OTHER SESSIONS IT INCLUDED </p><p>QUESTIONING OF MINISTERS AND A MODEST LAWMAKING AGENDA </p><p>(WHICH IN THE FALL SESSION IS GENERALLY LIGHTER THAN THE </p><p>SPRING\'S).

(COMMENT: </p><p>WHILE CLEARLY A PRAGMATIC, MORE MODERN LEADER THAN PHIEU, </p><p>MANH TO ALL APPEARANCES IS A LOYAL, COMMITTED COMMUNIST WHO </p><p>DOES NOT ENVISION ANY "EVOLUTION" TO A MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM. </p><p>END COMMENT.)  IN JANUARY MANH MET THE VISITING GEPHARDT </p><p>CODEL. </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) MANH ALSO CARRIED WATER FOR THE CPV IN ITS </p><p>INTERNAL PREPARATIONS FOR THE CONGRESS.

IN FEBRUARY HE WAS DEPICTED COMMEMORATING </p><p>THE 71ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CPV. </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU) AS PART OF HIS NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND CPV DUTIES, </p><p>MANH HAD A WIDE RANGE OF MEETINGS THAT CAN BE SEEN IN </p><p>RETROSPECT AS PART OF THE BROAD "CONSTITUENT BUILDING" HE </p><p>HAS DONE DURING THE PAST DECADE.  AS A GOOD LISTENER AND </p><p>ENGAGING CONVERSATIONALIST, MANH HAS BEEN QUIETLY BUILDING </p><p>A WELLSPRING OF GOOD OPINION THROUGH THESE KINDS OF </p><p>MEETING.  ON OCT. 19 HE ATTENDED THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF </p><p>THE FOUNDING OF THE VIETNAM WOMEN\'S UNION.  THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>PERIOD, HE WAS PICTURED IN THE PRESS MEETING WITH </p><p>VIETNAMESE GROUPS HANDLING THE PRESS, POVERTY REDUCTION </p><p>PROGRAMS, THE RAILWAY SERVICE, THE POSTAL SERVICE, WOMEN\'S </p><p>ISSUES, AND THE CPV YOUTH UNION, AMONG MANY OTHERS. </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) A MEMBER OF THE ETHNIC TAY MINORITY, AND THE ONLY </p><p>MINORITY MEMBER SERVING IN THE POLITBURO, MANH HELD A HIGH </p><p>PROFILE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD MEETING MINORITY MEMBERS.  HE </p><p>HELD WORKING SESSIONS WITH CPV LEADERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR </p><p>ETHNIC PEOPLE AND MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS, MET MINORITY </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FROM QUANG NINH AND DAKLAK PROVINCES IN </p><p>HANOI, AND VISITED SEVERAL PROVINCES WITH LARGE MINORITY </p><p>POPULATIONS.  FROM OCT. 12-16 HE VISITED FLOOD VICTIMS IN </p><p>NORTHWESTERN LAI CHAU PROVINCE AND HAD WORKING MEETINGS </p><p>THERE.  ON MARCH 9 HE SPOKE TO 60 ETHNIC MINORITY OFFICIALS </p><p>FROM DAKLAK WHO ARE ATTENDING THE PROVINCE\'S CPV POLITICS </p><p>SCHOOL.  MANH APPEALED TO MINORITIES TO OBEY THE LAW AND </p><p>COOPERATE WITH AUTHORITIES, PRAISED MINORITIES\' </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND URGED TEACHERS </p><p>TO FOCUS ON PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE IN THEIR CLASSES. </p><p>(COMMENT: PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF FEBRUARY\'S SOMETIMES- </p><p>VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, WE EXPECT </p><p>MANH WILL BE PUT FORWARD MORE FREQUENTLY AS A NEW SIGN OF </p><p>THE CPV\'S TOLERANCE INTEGRATION OF MINORITIES.  UNDER </p><p>MANH\'S LEADERSHIP WE DO NOT EXPECT DRAMATIC CHANGES IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S POLICIES TOWARD MINORITIES, HOWEVER.  SENIOR CPV </p><p>LEADERS ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK THE GVN WILL UNDERTAKE A </p><p>REINVIGORATED DEVELOPMENT PLAN TO HELP THE SEVERELY </p><p>IMPOVERISHED CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  CLEARLY THIS AREA HAS </p><p>GOTTEN THE ATTENTION OF SENIOR LEADERS, AND WE BELIEVE THEY </p><p>RECOGNIZE THAT DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LIVES OF THE </p><p>REGION\'S "MONTAGNARDS" ARE NEEDED IF THERE IS NOT TO BE </p><p>FURTHER RADICALIZATION OF THE CITIZENS.  HOWEVER, </p><p>TRANSLATING SUCH CONCERN INTO ACTION IS A HUGE CHALLENGE </p><p>FOR THE GVN.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  00952  06 OF 06  201136Z </p><p>23. (C) COMMENT: ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING INSIGHTS TO COME </p><p>FROM OUR TRACKING PROJECT IS HOW MANH HAS QUIETLY AND </p><p>CONSISTENTLY BEEN BUILDING PERSONAL SUPPORT AMONG THE CPV\'S </p><p>DISPARATE CONSTITUENT GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE PAST MONTHS AND </p><p>YEARS.  IN THE END, HIS WINSOME THOUGH NON-CHARISMATIC </p><p>PERSONALITY, HIS PRAGMATIC POLICY BENT, HIS PERSONAL LACK </p><p>OF "SCANDAL," AND HIS COLLEGIAL LISTENING SKILLS SEEM TO </p><p>HAVE WON THE DAY IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  LIKE ALL THOSE </p><p>WHO WIN CAMPAIGNS, HOWEVER, NOW COMES THE HARD PART.
