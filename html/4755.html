<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 007312 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: THE GOJ, PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND </p><p>ANTI-NORMALIZATION: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY? </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Since the middle of November, the Jordanian </p><p>Government has stepped up pressure on professional </p><p>associations to reform, with PM Abul Ragheb aggressively </p><p>championing the view that the associations should tend to the </p><p>needs of their members instead of engaging in political </p><p>activism on controversial subjects.  The issue of compulsory </p><p>membership in professional associations is once again a hot </p><p>topic of discussion among professionals we talk to.  In </p><p>addition, a November 28 decision annulled the latest </p><p>committee elections of the Jordanian Engineers\' Association </p><p>(JEA) and a GOJ-appointed caretaker committee called for new </p><p>committee elections to be held in February.  Although the GOJ </p><p>released three anti-normalization committee leaders from a </p><p>six week "interrogation", it made clear that </p><p>anti-normalization activities are illegal and will not be </p><p>tolerated.  The PM told a meeting of the presidents of the </p><p>professional associations that their complicity in organizing </p><p>anti-normalization committees and/or activities is unlawful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Street reaction is mixed.  Many professionals </p><p>support Abul Ragheb\'s position and also criticize compulsory </p><p>membership in the associations, but point to lack of </p><p>parliamentary elections (and of strong political parties) as </p><p>the ultimate reason for the associations\' growing influence </p><p>in the political realm.  Cynics (of which there are many) </p><p>suggest the GOJ is simply desperate to blunt the influence of </p><p>Islamists, whose supporters currently sit at the helm of the </p><p>most powerful of the professional associations.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>BACKGROUND:  HOW THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS GOT TO WHERE </p><p>THEY ARE </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Professional associations in Jordan first emerged in </p><p>the 1950s.  The associations were given wide latitude by the </p><p>GOJ to regulate their respective professions.   As political </p><p>parties were not given legitimacy in Jordan until 1989, the </p><p>professional associations assumed the role of surrogate </p><p>political vehicles for their memberships.  According to Raiq </p><p>Kamel (protect), a leftist former council member of the </p><p>Jordan Engineers\' Association, the associations were </p><p>dominated by leftist, pan-arabist leaderships until 1967. </p><p>Since then, Islamists have slowly but surely come to dominate </p><p>the leadership of the major professional associations </p><p>(engineers, lawyers, pharmacists, doctors, and others). </p><p>Currently, the leadership of the majority of the professional </p><p>associations consists nearly exclusively of Muslim </p><p>Brotherhood members and/or Islamists. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The anti-normalization "committee", established in the </p><p>mid 1990s, sprung from the ranks of the professional </p><p>associations (primarily the engineers\' association) as a </p><p>small group opposed to relations with Israel following the </p><p>signing of the Jordan-Israel Peace Treaty of 1994.  The </p><p>"committee", which has no official standing in Jordan as a </p><p>society or organization, has since grown in size and </p><p>influence, particularly since the breakdown of the peace </p><p>process in September 2000.  It has staged protests and </p><p>activities at the professional associations\' complex in </p><p>Shmesani, and has used "blacklists" of professionals as its </p><p>primary weapon of intimidation. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) All professionals must pay dues to their respective </p><p>professional associations in order to obtain, inter alia, </p><p>professional licenses and/or business registrations.  As the </p><p>associations have become increasingly vocal politically, </p><p>compulsory membership has not sat well with a number of </p><p>professionals, political whose views do not coincide with </p><p>those of their association.  Former Minister of Health Zaid </p><p>Hamzeh (protect) has consistently railed against compulsory </p><p>membership in the doctors\' association.  In an October </p><p>meeting with PolOff, he complained that a) many, if not most, </p><p>doctors do not subscribe to the political message carried </p><p>forth by the current leadership and b) the association has </p><p>done less and less over the years to regulate the medical </p><p>profession, thus neglecting their GOJ-mandated </p><p>responsibility.  Hamzeh noted that turnout at the doctors\' </p><p>association elections is less than 20 percent on average, </p><p>indicating apathy and disorganization among the moderate </p><p>majority of members.  According to Hamzeh, this is what </p><p>allows the organized Islamists the ability to win the </p><p>elections and operate the association for their political </p><p>ends. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>ABUL RAGHEB LEADS CHARGE </p><p>AGAINST ASSOCIATIONS </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  In November, PM Ali Abul Ragheb led a vocal call, </p><p>covered in the local press, for the professional associations </p><p>to reconsider their manifestations from regulatory bodies to </p><p>political machinery.  In subsequent conversations with </p><p>embassy officials, Abul Ragheb, an engineer by training, has </p><p>articulated his point of view with passion and at length. </p><p>Media columnists supportive of the GOJ have rallied to the </p><p>cause, with Al-Rai running a feature story December 9 on </p><p>unemployment among pharmacists, dentists, and engineers.  An </p><p>accompanying photo of the Professional Associations\' Complex </p><p>ran with the caption "By setting aside political activities </p><p>and by occupying themselves with the true concerns of the </p><p>profession, the professional associations would be able to </p><p>reduce unemployment." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>COURT ANNULS ENGINEERS\' ELECTIONS, </p><p>NEW ELECTIONS IN FEBRUARY </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) On November 28, the High Court of Justice annulled </p><p>the April elections of the Jordan Engineers\' Association </p><p>(JEA).  The court decision came after a number of association </p><p>members protested the elections because they were held before </p><p>new amendments to JEA bylaws were published in their Official </p><p>Gazette.  The court annulled the elections, and appointed a </p><p>caretaking committee that announced on December 4 that new </p><p>JEA elections would be held in February.  Note:  The </p><p>Islamists won all ten seats in the annulled April elections, </p><p>and have held a majority of JEA seats for more than ten </p><p>years. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>ANTI-NORMALIZATION COMMITTEE LEADERS </p><p>RELEASED, GOJ WARNS AGAINST FURTHER ACTIVITY. </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  In late November, the GOJ released three members of </p><p>the anti-normalization committee (and members of the Jordan </p><p>Engineers\' Association) after holding them since October 3 </p><p>for "interrogation".  The three members, which included head </p><p>of the anti-normalization committee Ali Abu Sukkar, were </p><p>detained for distributing anti-Israeli posters on school </p><p>grounds.  The PM told a meeting of the presidents of the </p><p>professional associations that their complicity in organizing </p><p>anti-normalization committees and/or activities is unlawful. </p><p>The Islamic Action Front issued a statement calling the GOJ\'s </p><p>stance "a violation of the public rights in resisting the </p><p>threats on the Zionist enemy on Jordan." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  On December 3, PolOff met with Ousauma Melkawi </p><p>(protect), former member of parliament and attorney.  Melkawi </p><p>criticized the professional associations and the </p><p>anti-normalization committee.  All professional associations </p><p>have been granted the right to regulate their professionals </p><p>by the GOJ, he said.  Thus, the GOJ has the right to step in </p><p>if the associations are not performing the tasks delegated to </p><p>them by the GOJ.  As for the anti-normalization committee, </p><p>Melkawi called it "unethical."  "Everyone in Jordan has the </p><p>right to a lawyer.  But if I, as a lawyer, represent an </p><p>Israeli businessmen who is here as a result of our peace </p><p>treaty, the anti-normalization committee will attack me, and </p><p>the JBA (Jordan Bar Association) can suspend me from the </p><p>practice of law."  Melkawi cited the case of Dr. Ahmad Zobi, </p><p>an attorney currently barred from the practice of law because </p><p>of his "contact" with Israelis.  Melkawi also pointed out </p><p>that the anti-normalization committee\'s "intimidation </p><p>tactics" are violating Jordanians\' right to association.  "A </p><p>Jordanian businessman can lose his business by associating </p><p>with Israelis.  We have a peace treaty with Israel. </p><p>Therefore, the anti-normalization committee is infringing on </p><p>our right to do business." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  For Melkawi, the solution to the issue of </p><p>professional associations is parliamentary elections, </p><p>followed by legislation calling for reform of the </p><p>associations, including the removal of the mandatory </p><p>membership requirement for professionals.  Melkawi believes </p><p>that if the GOJ passes a temporary law stripping the </p><p>professional associations of the mandatory membership </p><p>requirement, the incoming parliament will be under too much </p><p>pressure from the outset to deal with it.  There must be a </p><p>new parliament, and they themselves must pass new laws </p><p>governing the professional associations, he said. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) The tension between the professional associations </p><p>and the GOJ is nothing new, but the GOJ appears to be more </p><p>serious about confronting long-standing issues surrounding </p><p>the associations (and the anti-normalization committee) than </p><p>at any time in the recent past.  Cynics (primarily of the </p><p>Islamist variety) say the GOJ is merely attempting to mute </p><p>the voices of opposition.  With the extended delay of </p><p>parliamentary elections, residual anxiety from Ma\'an, and </p><p>regional tensions, this conclusion resonates well among the </p><p>economically marginalized. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Cynicism aside, the mandatory membership requirement for </p><p>professionals, many of whom do not agree with the political </p><p>agenda of their associations\' leadership, would be a </p><p>legitimate issue for the GOJ to confront.  Addressing the </p><p>"blacklist" intimidation tactics of the anti-normalization </p><p>committee is also a reasonable and expected concern for the </p><p>GOJ.  In the long-term, Jordanians will need more healthy </p><p>political vehicles through which they can express themselves. </p><p> Many here believe that parliamentary elections, and the </p><p>rehabilitation of political parties, will go a long way </p><p>towards this end. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
