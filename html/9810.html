<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 004848 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR A/S JONES AND NEA A/S BURNS. NSC FOR BRYZA. </p><p>OSD FOR ISA AND ISP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, PTER, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: AVOIDING DEHAP CONTACTS WITH PKK/KADEK, KDP, PUK, </p><p>AND THE USG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 4787 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 4017 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Charge d\'Affaires Robert Deutsch.  Reason: </p><p>1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Action Request:  MFA DG for Middle East Affairs </p><p>Burcuoglu called July 31 to inform Charge that members of </p><p>DEHAP (the political front of the PKK/KADEK) had entered Iraq </p><p>via Jordan and had already met with refugees at UNHCR\'s </p><p>Mahmour Refugee Camp.  According to the information, which </p><p>originally came from TGS, the DEHAP politicians also planned </p><p>to meet with KDP, PUK, PKK/KADEK, and possibly US officials. </p><p>Burcuoglu relayed U/S Ziyal\'s request that the Embassy </p><p>prevent any meeting with the PKK/KADEK.  Embassy Ankara does </p><p>not see any USG or GOT benefit in meeting the DEHAP </p><p>officials, thereby adding to their credibility.  DEHAP has </p><p>been unsupportive of the GOT\'s "amnesty" law and cannot be </p><p>relied upon to persuade PKK/KADEK members to take advantage </p><p>of this opportunity and avoid confrontation with US security </p><p>forces in Iraq.  Further it is clear that by meeting with </p><p>PKK/KADEK, DEHAP will: </p><p>-  create pressure against implementation of the GOT\'s </p><p>reintegration law, </p><p>-  increase pressure to ban DEHAP in Turkey with a resultant </p><p>impact on Turkey\'s political reform effort, </p><p>-  and increase questions about the US attitude toward the </p><p>PKK/KADEK in Iraq. </p><p>Embassy requests US officials in Iraq not meet with the DEHAP </p><p>delegation or, at least use any contact to argue against </p><p>DEHAP\'s meeting with PKK/KADEK.  Furthermore, we request the </p><p>KDP and PUK to advise the DEHAP del not to meet with the </p><p>PKK/KADEK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) A/PolCouns called DEHAP Vice Chairman Veli Buyuksahin </p><p>and made the following points 1) we understand the DEHAP </p><p>delegation was planning to meet with PKK/KADEK, which we </p><p>regard as a terrorist group; 2) the US Embassy will never </p><p>meet with any delegation member who has met with the </p><p>PKK/KADEK; 3) by meeting with PKK/KADEK, DEHAP as a party </p><p>will damage and could destroy its relationship with the US </p><p>Embassy; and 4) the relationship between DEHAP and the USG </p><p>will not protect the party from GOT retaliation.  He </p><p>acknowledged the points but made no comment. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
