ROME 1701 </p><p>     B. ROME 1679 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01731  01 OF 02  231651Z </p><p>     C. ROME 1618 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY.  MINDEF MARTINO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON APRIL </p><p>22 THAT ITALY WAS STILL LOOKING TO DEPLOY A FIELD HOSPITAL IN </p><p>BAGHDAD.  IT WOULD PROVIDE INTERNAL SECURITY, BUT HOPED THE </p><p>U.S. COULD ASSIST WITH PROTECTING THE PERIMETER.  THE GOI IS </p><p>WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE UK TO STAND UP AN ITALIAN ARMY </p><p>BRIGADE-SIZE FORCE IN THE BRITISH PHASE IV SECTOR.  SOME </p><p>400-500 CARABINIERI WILL ALSO BE DISPATCHED TO WORK ON </p><p>STABILIZATION TASKS NEAR BASRA.  THE AMBASSADOR URGED MARTINO </p><p>TO COORDINATE ALL OPERATIONAL DETAILS--HUMANITARIAN AND </p><p>MILITARY--WITH CENTCOM VIA THE ITALIAN LNO.  MARTINO ASSURED </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE LNO WOULD BE EMPOWERED TO ENGAGE </p><p>CENTCOM PLANNERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) MINDEF MARTINO REVIEWED ITALIAN PLANNING FOR LOCATING </p><p>A FIELD HOSPITAL AND PHASE IV DEPLOYMENTS DURING AN APRIL 22 </p><p>MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR.  MARTINO WAS ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR FRANCESCO TRUPIANO, WHO ELABORATED ON GOI </p><p>THINKING IN A FOLLOW-UP DISCUSSION WITH POLOFF. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR THANKED THE MINISTER FOR ITALY\'S </p><p>WELCOME EFFORTS TO ASSIST WITH RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ, AND </p><p>SAID HE WAS AWARE OF THE GOI\'S INTEREST IN DEPLOYING A FIELD </p><p>HOSPITAL TO BAGHDAD (REF A).  MARTINO NOTED THAT FM FRATTINI </p><p>WANTED THE HOSPITAL SITUATED IN THE IRAQI CAPITAL, ADDING </p><p>THAT HE HAD RECENTLY SPOKEN WITH THE ITALIAN CHOD, ROLANDO </p><p>MOSCA MOSCHINI, WHO RECOMMENDED DEPLOYMENT WITH EXTERNAL </p><p>PERIMETER SECURITY PROVIDED BY THE U.S. MILITARY.  THE MOD IS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01731  01 OF 02  231651Z </p><p>PREPARED TO BUNDLE SOME 30 CARABINIERI INTO THE PACKAGE TO </p><p>HANDLE "INTERNAL" SECURITY.  (NOTE: EMBASSY ECMIN COUNSELOR </p><p>RAISED THE SECURITY ISSUE DURING AN APRIL 23 MEETING WITH THE </p><p>GOI\'S IRAQ TASK FORCE DEPUTY DIRECTOR LUIGI MACCOTTA, </p><p>PRESSING THE POINT THAT ITALY NEEDED TO MAKE SURE ITS </p><p>HOSPITAL WAS SELF-PROTECTING.  MACCOTTA SAID HE CLEARLY </p><p>UNDERSTOOD ITALY NEEDED TO PROVIDE BOTH INTERNAL AND </p><p>PERIMETER SECURITY FOR THE FACILITY.  NEVERTHELESS, THE MFA </p><p>HOPED THE HOSPITAL COULD HAVE SOME CONNECTION TO U.S. </p><p>MILITARY FORCES OPERATING IN THE VICINITY, I.E. THAT U.S. </p><p>FORCES WOULD BE AWARE OF ITS PRESENCE AND GENERALLY KEEP AN </p><p>EYE OUT FOR THREATS TO ITALIAN PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT. END NOTE) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AMBASSADOR SEMBLER URGED MARTINO TO COORDINATE ALL </p><p>ITALIAN HUMANITARIAN AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE THROUGH CENTCOM, </p><p>INCLUDING ANY SECURITY-RELATED REQUESTS.  THE EMBASSY\'S </p><p>UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT ITALY\'S LNO, GENERAL SANTINI, HAD BEEN </p><p>EMPOWERED TO ENGAGE IN "TWO-WAY CONVERSATIONS" IN TAMPA. </p><p>MARTINO RESPONDED THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE SANTINI HAD BEEN SO </p><p>EMPOWERED, BUT, RETURNING TO THE POINT LATER IN THE </p><p>DISCUSSION, ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THE LNO WOULD HAVE THE </p><p>NECESSARY AUTHORITY TO WORK WITH CENTCOM PLANNERS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) MARTINO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ITALY IS COOPERATING </p><p>CLOSELY WITH THE UK ON DEPLOYING AN ITALIAN ARMY (ITA) </p><p>BRIGADE-SIZE FORCE IN THE BRITISH PHASE IV SECTOR AROUND </p><p>BASRA (REF B).  OPERATING UNDER UK COMMAND AUTHORITY WOULD </p><p>NOT BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE ITA HAS A GREAT DEAL OF </p><p>EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH ITS UK COUNTERPART.  TRUPIANO </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT A BRITISH MILITARY PLANNING TEAM WOULD MEET </p><p>WITH ITALIAN DEFENSE GENERAL STAFF (IDGS) OFFICERS ON APRIL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01731  01 OF 02  231651Z </p><p>23 TO IRON OUT DETAILS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ITALY IS ALSO INTERESTED IN DEPLOYING A 400-500 MAN </p><p>CARABINIERI CONTINGENT TO ASSIST WITH STABILIZATION EFFORTS. </p><p>THE IDGS IS INSISTING THAT ITALY\'S MILITARY FORCE PACKAGE BE </p><p>SELF-CONTAINED; THEREFORE, THE CARABINIERI UNITS WILL MOST </p><p>LIKELY DEPLOY TOGETHER WITH THE ARMY IN THE UK SECTOR. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) ASKED WHETHER THE GOI HAD RECEIVED SUFFICIENT </p><p>AUTHORITY FROM PARLIAMENT TO DEPLOY MILITARY FORCES (REF C), </p><p>MARTINO SAID APPROVAL TO DEPLOY UP TO 3000 TROOPS IN SUPPORT </p><p>OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE EFFORTS HAD BEEN GRANTED. (NOTE: </p><p>THE GOI IS ACTUALLY PLANNING TO PLACE SOME 1700-2000 BOOTS ON </p><p>THE GROUND. END NOTE)  HOWEVER, HE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK </p><p>BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE TO DEFINE THE GOVERNMENT\'S SPECIFIC </p><p>PHASE IV PLANS.  TRUPIANO LATER CLARIFIED THAT THE GOI WILL </p><p>DEFINITELY NEED PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL FOR THE BRIGADE AND </p><p>THE MAIN CARABINIERI DEPLOYMENT, IF NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCE ACCOMPANYING THE FIELD HOSPITAL.  HE </p><p>UNDERSCORED THAT BOTH LEGAL AND FINANCIAL AUTHORIZATION WOULD </p><p>BE REQUIRED, BUT THOUGHT THIS WOULD NOT BE PROBLEMATIC. </p><p>MARTINO WOULD PROBABLY GO BEFORE PARLIAMENT TO PRESENT THE </p><p>GOI\'S PLANS IN EARLY MAY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4556 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01731  02 OF 02  231652Z </p><p>ACTION NEA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DOEE-00 </p><p>      DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      VCE-00   MFLO-03  AC-01    NSAE-00  OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /007W </p><p>                  ------------------5A0985  231653Z /38 </p><p>O 231648Z APR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9386 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY LONDON IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY WARSAW IMMEDIATE </p><p>USCINCCENT MACDILL AFB FL IMMEDIATE </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9387 </p><p>NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 001731 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, EAID, IT, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: MINDEF MARTINO ON ITALIAN PLANS FOR FIELD </p><p>HOSPITAL, PHASE IV </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01731  02 OF 02  231652Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME01731 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
