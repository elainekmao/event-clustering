<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003261 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR,  JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON SHARM EL-SHEIKH AND AQABA </p><p>SUMMITS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                     News Reports </p><p> </p><p> -- All dailies on June 4 led with reports, continued </p><p>on the inside pages, on the Sharm  El-Sheikh summit. </p><p>In his address, King Abdullah stressed that the </p><p>Palestinian issue was the core of the Arab-Israeli </p><p>conflict and that this was a historic opportunity for </p><p>peace. President Bush\'s speech at the Sharm summit was </p><p>reported in frontpage headlines. He was quoted saying </p><p>that the world needs a Palestinian State and that a </p><p>free trade zone within the Middle East should be </p><p>established to guarantee stability. Another leading </p><p>report mentioned that Jordan is hosting the Bush-Abbas- </p><p>Sharon summit today in Aqaba and the mechanisms to </p><p>implement the Roadmap will be discussed. The center- </p><p>left, influential Arabic daily,  Al-Dustour, led with </p><p>the headline: "The King Hosts the \'Birth of A </p><p>Palestinian State\' Summit in Aqaba Today" All dailies </p><p>noted that the differences on the issue of "terrorism" </p><p>that delayed the Sharm El-Sheikh summit\'s opening </p><p>session and caused some participating leaders to </p><p>cancel the delivery of their scheduled speeches. </p><p> </p><p>Other related frontpage reports said that Secretary of </p><p>State Powell warned Palestinian President Arafat not </p><p>to do anything that would obstruct the peace process. </p><p>It was also reported that the Arab and U.S. statements </p><p>in Sharm agreed on the rejection of terrorism and </p><p>violence and called for concessions from Israel. </p><p>National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice was quoted </p><p>as saying that President Bush did not ask for the </p><p>return of the Egyptian and Jordanian ambassadors to </p><p>Israel. </p><p> </p><p>-- The G-8 Summit in Evian concluded. All dailies </p><p>carried either frontpage or inside page reports on the </p><p>conclusion of the G-8 summit, which issued a final </p><p>communiqu stressing on the sovereignty of Iraq, </p><p>expressing support for the Roadmap, and calling for </p><p>the combat of terrorism. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>Editorial commentaries dealt with the Sharm and Aqaba </p><p>summits. Commentators expressed cautious optimism over </p><p>the U.S. stand on the Palestinian issue and considered </p><p>the Aqaba summit a great historic opportunity for </p><p>peace, calling for the exertion of decisive U.S. </p><p>pressures on Sharon. Below are sample commentaries. </p><p> </p><p>-- "What Will Happen At the Aqaba Summit?" </p><p> </p><p>Chief Editor Taher Udwan wrote in independent,    mass- </p><p>appeal Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm (06/04): "There </p><p>are negative and positive aspects of the road map. The </p><p>first and most serious of those negative aspects is </p><p>the existence of a right-wing extremist government, </p><p>headed by Sharon, in Tel Aviv. A few weeks ago, </p><p>Israel\'s prime minister said that he is not concerned </p><p>with the Roadmap. One thing can only explain his </p><p>presence in Aqaba today and that is, President Bush\'s </p><p>strong pressures on him. One of the positive aspects </p><p>of the summit is that the U.S. president, who sent his </p><p>troops to occupy Iraq in the name of liberation and </p><p>democracy is asked to put an end to the plight of the </p><p>Palestinians." </p><p> </p><p>Udwan continues: "The Aqaba summit is a great and </p><p>historic opportunity for peace that will be crowned </p><p>with an independent Palestinian state. However, we </p><p>should not go overboard with out hopes and </p><p>expectations. Wagering on decisive U.S. pressures on </p><p>Sharon needs facts rather than analyses and hopes. </p><p>Moreover, the continued existence of Sharon and a </p><p>Likud government will remain a continuous threat to </p><p>the Roadmap and to empty it from its contents through </p><p>Israeli maneuvers, hurdles, and procrastinations. </p><p>However, we still must utilize this opportunity on a </p><p>Palestinian and Arab level and this is what will </p><p>happen at the Aqaba summit today." </p><p>-- "The Road Map At the Aqaba Summit" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Fahd Fanek wrote on the back page of </p><p>semi-official, influential Arabic daily Al-Rai </p><p>(06/04): "The presence of U.S. President Bush at the </p><p>Sharm   El-Sheikh and Aqaba summits is a sign of the </p><p>United States\' commitment this time. It also shows </p><p>U.S. willingness to exert enough pressure to accept </p><p>the Roadmap and to start implementing it without any </p><p>amendments - but also taking into consideration </p><p>Israel\'s fears as the president\'s reputation is </p><p>standing a test and he does not want to register any </p><p>failures on the eve of the next presidential </p><p>elections." </p><p> </p><p>Fanek continues: "If President Bush succeeds in </p><p>achieving peace in the Middle East, then this will be </p><p>a compensation for some of the negative repercussions </p><p>of the aggression against Iraq and his success in this </p><p>regard will serve the interests of all parties and </p><p>will be an accomplishment that no one can deny." </p><p> </p><p>He adds: "Bitter experiences in the past called for </p><p>caution. We are much more pessimistic than optimistic </p><p>and Sharon\'s acceptance of the Roadmap under pressure </p><p>may just be a mere tactic, after which Sharon will </p><p>jump at the first opportunity to back out and render </p><p>the plan a failure." </p><p> </p><p>-- "Will The Aqaba Summit Be A Turning Point?" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Rakan Majali wrote on the back page of </p><p>center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(06/04): A"We can say that President Bush came out of </p><p>Sharm El-Sheikh summit, carrying reassurances to the </p><p>Palestinians and Israelis that any agreement between </p><p>them at the Aqaba summit will receive the world\'s </p><p>blessings as expressed at the Evian summit and the </p><p>Arabs\' blessings as reflected at the Sharm summit." </p><p> </p><p>Majali continues: "It is hoped that the Aqaba summit </p><p>will be a turning point and, primarily, a starting </p><p>point for the United States to regain some of its </p><p>credibility, based on which a just and comprehensive </p><p>peace can be built and Arab-U.S. relations can be </p><p>improved. It is also the prelude to security and </p><p>stability in the region." </p><p> </p><p>-- "The Aqaba Summit" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bassem Sakejha wrote on the op-ed </p><p>page of the center-left, influential Arabic daily </p><p>Al-Dustour (06/04): "It is clear that the United </p><p>States\' way of dealing with the Israeli party will be </p><p>put Washington\'s image in the region to the test after </p><p>its occupation of Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>He adds: "We are cautiously optimistic about the U.S. </p><p>stand. Introductions do not always lead to logical </p><p>results. The introductions these days indicate that </p><p>George Bush does not need the Jewish vote to win in </p><p>the next election. They voted against him in the past </p><p>elections. He just came out of two great victories in </p><p>Afghanistan and Iraq and he is enjoying world support </p><p>for his Middle East plan. All this and that leads to a </p><p>logical result, that is, pressure on Israel and </p><p>imposing a solution in the region. But, as we have </p><p>said, results may not always be logical." </p><p> </p><p>Sakejha concludes: "It remains to be said that </p><p>selecting Aqaba as a venue for the summit has a </p><p>special significance. Jordan is the closest to the </p><p>Palestinian issue and its role has always been </p><p>pivotal. So, we should expect this role to increase in </p><p>the coming days." </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
