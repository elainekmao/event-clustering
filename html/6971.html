(SBU) DART Field Office/North hosted a 22 March NGO/IO </p><p>coordination meeting in Ankara to discuss the NGO </p><p>registration process with the Turkish government, memorandums </p><p>of understanding for working in or transiting Turkey, and </p><p>options for entering northern Iraq through other countries. </p><p>Sixteen international and non-governmental organizations </p><p>expecting to be involved in the humanitarian response in </p><p>Turkey or northern Iraq were represented.  Additionally, two </p><p>representatives of the U.S. military attended the meeting to </p><p>brief the humanitarian community on the military,s proposed </p><p>humanitarian activities and how it might cooperate with </p><p>humanitarian workers inside Iraq.  UN OCHA agreed to host </p><p>future coordination meetings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) UN OCHA hosted a subsequent NGO/IO coordination </p><p>meeting on 25 March.  UNHCR, IOM, UNICEF and WFP briefed the </p><p>representatives of eight NGOs, IFRC and the American Red </p><p>Cross on their current and proposed humanitarian activities </p><p>in Turkey and northern Iraq.  Following the briefings, NGOs </p><p>gave updates on their registration with the Turkish </p><p>government and presented their proposed activities in Turkey </p><p>and northern Iraq.  DART Field Office/North will continue to </p><p>attend and monitor these meetings while in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>NGOs Registering with the Turkish Government </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) At present, the registration process and the </p><p>timeframe for completing registration with the MFA remain </p><p>unclear.  In commenting on this process, UN OCHA declared it </p><p>quote a work in progress unquote.  The UN believed that the </p><p>MFA would provide answers to NGO questions about registration </p><p>the week of 24 March.  On 10 March IRC submitted its request </p><p>to both work in Turkey and transit through to northern Iraq, </p><p>and they hoped to receive an official response from the MFA </p><p>by the end of March (Comment: There has been no response from </p><p>MFA on either issue.  End comment).  A number of NGOs asked </p><p>if their concerns and their need to move forward could </p><p>somehow be relayed to the MFA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) While registration is in process, there remain a </p><p>number of outstanding issues for NGOs.  First, it is unclear </p><p>what bureaucratic actions will be necessary for each transit </p><p>or shipment of commodities through Turkey.  Second, it is </p><p>also unclear for how long a transit permit will be valid. </p><p>Some NGOs had the impression that the permit would be valid </p><p>for only one transit, but UN OCHA stated that the MFA was </p><p>looking at granting them for quote a window of time unquote. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The UN Joint Logistics Center representative stated </p><p>that UNJLC was evaluating the Syrian corridor for supplying </p><p>northern Iraq.  He reported that WFP and UNICEF were also </p><p>looking at the viability of this option.  International </p><p>Medical Corps representatives contacted the Syrian </p><p>authorities but were informed that international NGOs were </p><p>not being registered at this time.  In response, the UN </p><p>representatives said that this could be old information, and </p><p>that NGOs should inquire again.  The UN stated that if the </p><p>clearances through Syria were a problem, NGOs could possibly </p><p>use the UN umbrella. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Working in Turkey and northern Iraq </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) UNHCR,s deputy representative for Turkey noted that </p><p>the UN would be taking part in meetings at the Turkish </p><p>government,s Crisis Coordination Center in Diyarbakir </p><p>beginning the week of 24 March.  Daily meetings are scheduled </p><p>to deal with humanitarian issues in Turkey, including </p><p>refugees and border activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) UNHCR noted that there was now a new Crisis Management </p><p>structure that NGOs might use for registration, and that it </p><p>may prove faster than normal channels for moving registration </p><p>along.  UNHCR believes there is good will on the part of the </p><p>Turkish government and that the process may become more </p><p>efficient. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Several NGOs (the International Rescue Committee </p><p>(IRC), Northwest Medical Team International, World Relief - </p><p>through their local partner, Global Source Network - and </p><p>CARE) expressed an interest in working with UNHCR in Turkey </p><p>if the need arises.  Save the Children expressed interest in </p><p>community services, and Oxfam is looking at possible programs </p><p>along the Turkish-Iraqi border and over the border if UNHCR </p><p>works there.  While pleased with the interest, UNHCR informed </p><p>the NGOs that travel to the southeast region of Turkey was </p><p>restrictive, and people should not attempt to visit the </p><p>region without proper clearances from the MFA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Most of the NGOs present at the meetings said they </p><p>will work in northern Iraq.  They are CARE, SCF, IRC, the </p><p>International Medical Corps (IMC) and Shelter for Life </p><p>(formerly Shelter Now).  CARE, SCF, IRC and IMC have all </p><p>submitted proposals to USAID/OFDA for cooperative agreements </p><p>to work in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>U.S. Military </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) At the 22 March meeting, representatives from the </p><p>U.S. military spoke about the military,s civil affairs </p><p>program and the possibilities for cooperating with </p><p>humanitarian workers once their organizations were inside </p><p>northern Iraq.  Sharing security and assessment information </p><p>and logistical support, if available, were mentioned.  A </p><p>lively discussion followed the presentation, centering on the </p><p>diverse concerns and needs that the military and humanitarian </p><p>agencies have to reach their respective goals and objectives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Working in Turkey, continued </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) In the second coordination meeting in three days, </p><p>UNHCR,s representative for Turkey informed the NGOs that </p><p>planning for refugees and asylum seekers was ongoing with the </p><p>Turkish government and the Turkish Red Crescent Society </p><p>(Kizilay).  The representative stated that pre-positioning </p><p>supplies had been difficult, and that UNHCR was still seeking </p><p>clarification from the Turkish government on camp sites </p><p>within Turkey, border issues and possible activities inside </p><p>northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) UNHCR plans to pre-position commodities for up to </p><p>136,000 refugees.  They currently have tents and other </p><p>non-food items for 60,000-70,000 persons.  UNHCR is also </p><p>planning for 56,000 potential refugees or asylum seekers who </p><p>will arrive at the Turkish-Iraqi border but not be admitted </p><p>to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) Agreements have been made with partner UN agencies to </p><p>provide services to UNHCR in Turkey.  IOM will provide </p><p>transport, WFP will provide food and UNICEF will provide </p><p>services in health, nutrition and mine awareness.  UNHCR will </p><p>provide protection and community services.  The </p><p>representative asked the NGOs to consider what services they </p><p>might provide to UNHCR in Turkey if the need arises. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) WFP has pre-positioned 30,000 metric tons of dry </p><p>food stocks in two warehouses in Turkey that, according to </p><p>UNHCR, will provide them with four weeks of rations.  WFP </p><p>also has 6,200 metric tons of wheat flour, 3,600 metric tons </p><p>of vegetable oil and 3,000 metric tons of biscuits that they </p><p>are targeting for Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) IOM is responsible for caring for third-country </p><p>nationals in Turkey, although few are expected.  IOM also </p><p>will provide transport for refugees and medical services. </p><p>They have local medical staff but would require additional </p><p>medical support if a large influx of refugees was to occur. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Northern Iraq </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) The Northern Iraq Field Representative for UNICEF and </p><p>the WFP Logistics Officer stationed in Ankara spoke about the </p><p>situation in northern Iraq.  WFP and UNICEF have functioning </p><p>offices in northern Iraq, and they are in daily contact with </p><p>local staff members in Dohuk, Erbil and Sulaimaniyah. </p><p>Expatriate staff were evacuated before the start of the war. </p><p>WFP also has offices in Mosul and Kirkuk, but there has been </p><p>no contact since the war began. </p><p>17. (SBU) WFP has conducted assessments in northern Iraq, and </p><p>they are prepared to move 100,000 metric tons of food over </p><p>the border if it is needed.  Transport has been engaged for </p><p>this amount.  The Northern Iraq Field Representative for </p><p>UNICEF stated that there had been two years of good rain in </p><p>the region and that good harvest, complimenting the WFP food </p><p>stocks, will lessen food needs.  The Field Representative </p><p>went on to say, however, that a major influx of displaced </p><p>persons would strain this situation.  In preparing for a </p><p>possible influx of IDPs, UNICEF has moved some supplies away </p><p>the frontline.  Eighteen camp sites have been set up and, if </p><p>there is a need, public buildings have been identified and </p><p>could be made available. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) The UNICEF Field Representative informed the NGOs </p><p>and IOs present that following the onset of the war as many </p><p>as 600,000 people had moved in the Kurdish-controlled region </p><p>of Iraq.  People moved from cities to villages and into the </p><p>mountains, fearing that the Iraqi forces might shell the </p><p>cities.  After 48 hours, the vast majority of these people </p><p>returned to their homes.  The Field Representative stated </p><p>that there had been no movements toward the Turkish and </p><p>Iranian borders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) UNICEF reports that there are now 250,000 to </p><p>280,000 IDPs in the Kurdish-controlled region.  Local </p><p>authorities are trying to persuade people to return to their </p><p>homes.  They worry that if the frontline does open and there </p><p>is a large influx of people, empty homes could be occupied by </p><p>IDPs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (U) The UNICEF Field Representative noted that there are </p><p>potential problems in northern Iraq, as well as some </p><p>strengths in the communities.  There is a shortage of fuel </p><p>and it is three to four times its normal price.  There are </p><p>needs in shelter and medicine, particularly in pediatrics and </p><p>maternal care.  Budgets are tight, and there is a need for </p><p>training in the health sector as many qualified people have </p><p>either left the region or not had access to up-to-date </p><p>educational opportunities.  Strengths cited are good local </p><p>capacity (e.g., organization, management and skill levels) </p><p>and communications. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (U) UN OCHA will host another NGO/IO coordination meeting </p><p>on 2 April at UN House in Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
