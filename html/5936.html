<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000403 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO POL FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MASS, PREL, PGOV, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: BATAGARAWA ON MPRI; C-130 SPARE PARTS </p><p>FUNDING AND ELECTION PREPARATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 ABUJA 3156 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: During a February 20 meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Jeter, Minister of State for Defense (Army) </p><p>Lawal Batagarawa promised to discuss funding problems for </p><p>MPRI and the shipment of U.S. donated C-130 spare parts </p><p>with Minister of Finance Adamu Ciroma.  Turning to the </p><p>upcoming elections, Batagarawa said the military would be </p><p>ready to help the Nigerian National Police (NNP) in </p><p>maintaining order, but it would not take action unless the </p><p>NNP requested assistance.  Batagarawa also said that if </p><p>necessary, the military would provide logistical assistance </p><p>to the Independent National Elections Commission (INEC). </p><p>Finally, Ambassador expressed his concern that possible </p><p>U.S. military action in Iraq could lead to potentially </p><p>violent anti-American demonstrations.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) During a February 20 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, </p><p>Minister of State for Defense (Army) Lawal Batagarawa </p><p>promised to look into problems of obtaining GON funding for </p><p>MPRI (REFTEL) and the shipment of U.S. donated C-130 spare </p><p>parts.  Batagarawa said he would raise both issues with </p><p>Minister of Finance Adamu Ciroma on Friday, February 21 and </p><p>promised to update the Embassy on Monday, February 24. </p><p>(COMMENT: As of Tuesday, February 25, Post has not been </p><p>contacted by Batagarawa\'s office and ODC Abuja attempts to </p><p>elicit the information from the MOD\'s Office of Joint </p><p>Services have been unsuccessful.  Ambassador plans to </p><p>initiate a call to Batagarawa within the next few days.  END </p><p>COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) While Batagarawa said he was "embarrassed" by the </p><p>GON\'s inability to honor its commitments to these programs, </p><p>he expressed sympathy for Ciroma.  He noted that the </p><p>Minister of Finance is under tremendous pressure to release </p><p>funds at a time when cash flows into government coffers are </p><p>"extraordinarily poor".  Nevertheless, Batagarawa said he </p><p>would work to resolve the issue before the end of March. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Ambassador asked Batagarawa what the military was </p><p>doing to prepare for the April elections.  The Minister </p><p>said internal security was the responsibility of the NNP, </p><p>however, the military would be prepared to lend assistance </p><p>if the police requested it.  Batagarawa also said the </p><p>military was prepared to assist INEC in transporting </p><p>election materials throughout the country, if required. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Finally, Ambassador expressed his concern that </p><p>possible U.S. military action against Iraq could lead to </p><p>potentially violent anti-American demonstrations in Abuja </p><p>and elsewhere in Nigeria.  When asked how intense he </p><p>thought such protests might be, Batagarawa declined to </p><p>"speculate" and said he wanted more time to think about the </p><p>issue before making a statement.  (COMMENT: We plan to </p><p>follow-up with Batagarawa and other senior GON officials on </p><p>this issue.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Ambassador discussed MPRI funding with President </p><p>Obasanjo in November (REFTEL) and, like the problems </p><p>surrounding the shipment of the C-130 spare parts, he has </p><p>raised the issue with Batagarawa on multiple occasions. </p><p>Despite promises from all levels of the GON to resolve </p><p>these issues, little progress has been made thus far. </p><p>While there is some hope the GON will eventually make good </p><p>on its financial commitments to MPRI and take advantage of </p><p>the donated C-130 parts (The Ambassador raised the C-130 </p><p>spare parts issue on February 24 with President Obasanjo\'s </p><p>Permanent Secretary, who might be able to produce </p><p>results.), it is unlikely the GON will do anything until </p><p>after the distraction of the upcoming elections has receded </p><p>into the past. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) It is unlikely the NNP will be able to contain any </p><p>serious outbreaks of violence without the support of the </p><p>military.  Batagarawa\'s comments reflect both the hope </p><p>within the military that it will not be needed to maintain </p><p>order and the recognition that if electoral and communal </p><p>violence escalate during the run-up to elections the </p><p>military is the only dependable guarantor of peace in </p><p>Nigeria.  END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
