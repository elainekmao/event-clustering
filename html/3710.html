<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 002569 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>PLEASE PASS TO TREASURY - OFFICE OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAS: MONEY LAUNDERING IMPLEMENTATION GETS OFF </p><p>TO A GOOD START </p><p> </p><p>REF:  TEGUCIGALPA 725 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  Three Treasury consultants held a seminar on </p><p>money laundering and financial crimes from August 24-26 for </p><p>40 judges, prosecutors, police investigators, Banking </p><p>Commission officials and bank compliance officers.  The </p><p>seminar was well received by the Honduran participants and </p><p>the Treasury consultants commented that there is good </p><p>cooperation among the different GOH entities responsible for </p><p>enforcement of the law.  The Financial Information Unit is </p><p>up and running and investigating 25 cases of suspected money </p><p>laundering.  One of these cases is being prepared for </p><p>prosecution.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  From August 24-26, three consultants (Jim Parrott, </p><p>Ronald Cleaver and Gary Kruchten) from the Department of </p><p>Treasury\'s Office of Technical Assistance held a seminar in </p><p>Tegucigalpa on money laundering and financial crimes for 40 </p><p>judges, prosecutors, police investigators, Banking </p><p>Commission officials and bank compliance officers.  The </p><p>Treasury consultants commented that they were impressed with </p><p>the quality of the questions raised and the level of </p><p>interest among the participants.  The seminar was the third </p><p>money laundering technical assistance visit by Parrott to </p><p>support the GOH as it implements its strengthened money </p><p>laundering legislation (reftel).  In April, Parrot reviewed </p><p>the law that had been adopted by the National Congress and </p><p>met with Banking Commission officials, prosecutors, the </p><p>Supreme Court and the banking association to do a technical </p><p>assistance needs assessment.  He returned with an attorney </p><p>from NAS Guatemala to provide an overview of the operations </p><p>of an FIU and spent time with prosecutors and Banking </p><p>Commission officials reviewing draft implementing </p><p>regulations. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Treasury is currently planning a trip (tentatively </p><p>programmed for November) for Financial Information Unit </p><p>(FIU) officials and the prosecutor assigned to the FIU to </p><p>visit a successful FIU in Latin America (possibly Colombia). </p><p>Treasury is also talking with FINCEN about arranging for a </p><p>computer expert to travel to Tegucigalpa to advise Honduran </p><p>FIU officials on organizing and upgrading their computer </p><p>system.  Embassy hopes to continue to use Treasury </p><p>consultants to provide training to GOH authorities (banking </p><p>officials, prosecutors, judges, police) on money laundering, </p><p>financial crimes and investigative techniques and envisions </p><p>a one to two-year technical assistance program, provided </p><p>funding is available. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The FIU is up and running and currently investigating 25 </p><p>cases of suspected money laundering.  One of the cases is </p><p>being prepared for prosecution.  The FIU consists of five </p><p>officials, including three analysts and one full-time </p><p>prosecutor.  Both the prosecutors and Banking Commission </p><p>officials commented on the constructive working relationship </p><p>within the FIU. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Of concern to the Treasury consultants was the physical </p><p>security of the FIU.  There is currently uncontrolled access </p><p>to the computer systems and sensitive banking information, </p><p>compromising not only the security of the FIU but also </p><p>hindering information sharing among regional FIU\'s and </p><p>FINCEN.  Banking Commission President Ana Cristina de </p><p>Pereira agreed to take measures to improve the FIU\'s </p><p>physical security.  However, budget restrictions (the </p><p>Banking Commission\'s 2002 budget did not include money for </p><p>upgrades to the FIU) may limit what the Banking Commission </p><p>can do in the short-term to upgrade security.  Pereira </p><p>remarked that she would request money in the Commission\'s </p><p>2003 budget for a comprehensive FIU security upgrade. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Post would like to thank Treasury for its extremely </p><p>timely and helpful support in ensuring implementation of the </p><p>GOH\'s strengthened money laundering legislation. </p><p> </p><p>Pierce </p><p></p></div>
