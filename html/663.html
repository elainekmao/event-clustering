<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ADANA 0290 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PINS, MOPS, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  TURKEY DESTROYS PKK\'S ZALEH CAMP -- AGAIN </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) THE TURKISH PRESS REPORTED ON MAY 19TH THAT </p><p>TURKISH F-16S AND F-4S HAD AGAIN BOMBED THE PKK\'S ZALEH </p><p>CAMP IN NORTHERN IRAQ, AND BOASTED THAT THE CAMP WAS </p><p>"RAZED TO THE GROUND." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE TAF HAD PREVIOUSLY BOMBED ZALEH CAMP ON </p><p>JANUARY 29, AND AT THAT TIME CLAIMED THAT HUNDREDS OF PKK </p><p>PAGE 02 RUFTWPA1266 C O N F I D E N T I A L ADANA 0290 </p><p>MILITANTS WERE KILLED.  HOWEVER, THE PKK WAS WARNED OF THE </p><p>JANUARY RAID, ALLEGEDLY BECAUSE ADVANCE NOTIFICATION GIVEN </p><p>TO IRAQI KURDISH LEADER JALAL TALABANI WAS PASSED ON TO </p><p>THE PKK.  AS A RESULT, DESPITE TURKISH CLAIMS OF HUNDREDS </p><p>OF CASUALTIES IN THE JANUARY RAID, CONSULATE RECEIVED </p><p>CREDIBLE REPORTS FROM THE AREA THAT PUT THE NUMBER OF </p><p>FATALITIES AT A FRACTION OF THAT, PERHAPS AS LOW AS 10. </p><p>AT ANY RATE, THE PKK QUICKLY RECLAIMED THE CAMP AND MOVED </p><p>BACK. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THIS TIME, THERE WAS NO WARNING, AND THE TAF </p><p>CLAIMS OF HEAVY PKK CASUALTIES MAY BE MORE ACCURATE. </p><p>SECONDHAND REPORTS COMING OUT OF NORTHERN IRAQ INDICATE </p><p>THAT AS MANY AS 100-200 PKK MILITANTS MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED </p><p>IN THE RAID.  INJURED MILITANTS WERE REPORTEDLY BROUGHT AS </p><p>FAR AS DAHUK HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT, INDICATING THAT </p><p>FACILTIES CLOSER TO THE CAMP SITE MAY HAVE BEEN </p><p>OVERLOADED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: CONSULATE HAS BECOME EXTREMELY CYNICAL </p><p>PAGE 03 RUFTWPA1266 C O N F I D E N T I A L ADANA 0290 </p><p>ABOUT OFFICIAL CASUALTY FIGURES RELEASED AFTER LARGE </p><p>OPERATIONS LIKE THE AIR STRIKE AGAINST ZALEH CAMP, OR THE </p><p>RECENT CROSS-BORDER OPERATION.  IRRESPECTIVE OF THE TOTAL </p><p>CASUALTIES, HOWEVER, SUCH STRIKES MAY FORCE THE PKK TO </p><p>CHANGE ITS TACTICS, SCATTER ITS MILITANTS INTO SMALLER </p><p>OPERATING UNITS, AND STOP CONGREGATING IN LARGE CAMPS THAT </p><p>ARE EASILY RECOGNIZABLE AND HARD TO DEFEND FROM AIR </p><p>ATTACKS.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WAAREN </p><p></p></div>
