CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  CZECHOSLVOAKIA\'S "QUIET" </p><p>REVOLUTION, WITH THE CIVIC FORUM IN ITS </p><p>VANGUARD, HAS REALLY ONLY JUST BEGUN, BUT IT </p><p>HAS REACHED AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE IN FORCING </p><p>THE REGIME TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE.  THE FORUM\'S </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT  UNDERESTIMATE THE LONG </p><p>FIGHT AHEAD BEFORE THE LEGAL AND TACTICAL </p><p>ROADBLOCKS THE CPCZ WILL PUT IN THE WAY OF </p><p>ACHIEVING SUCH GOALS AS FREE ELECTIONS CAN BE </p><p>OVERCOME AND THE PRESENT TOTALITARIAN SYSTEM </p><p>CAN BE  GRADUALLY TRANSFORMED INTO A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>A NON-VIOLENT REVOLUTION </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  WHAT HAS OCCURRED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA OVER </p><p>THE PAST 12 DAYS IS NOTHING SHORT OF A POPULAR </p><p>REVOLUTION, BUT A NON-VIOLENT ONE.  IT IS A </p><p>REVOLUTION SPARKED BY STUDENTS AND ARTISTS IN </p><p>REACTION TO THE BRUTAL SUPPRESSION ON NOVEMBER </p><p>17 OF A STUDENT DEMONSTRATION AND THEN JOINED </p><p>BY WORKERS AND THE GREAT MASS OF THE PEOPLE. </p><p>LIKE THE PRAGUE SPRING OF 1968, THIS REVOLUTION </p><p>HAS ITS ROOTS IN THE GRADUAL LOSS OF FEAR BY </p><p>THE MAN IN THE STREET OF REGIME REPRESSION, </p><p>BUT DIFFERS FROM 1968 IN THAT IT ORIGINATED </p><p>FROM WITHIN THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND NOT SO </p><p>MUCH FROM REFORM ELEMENTS WITHIN THE CPCZ.  IT </p><p>THUS IS MORE OF A REJECTION OF THE 41 YEARS </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY\'S COMMUNIST PAST. </p><p> </p><p>THE FORUM:  A LOOSE COALITION </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  BUT IF THIS REVOLUTION BEGAN SPONTANEOUSLY, ITS </p><p>POPULAR FOCAL POINT QUICKLY BECAME THE "CIVIC FORUM," </p><p>SYMBOLIZED BY PLAYWRIGHT VACLAV HAVEL.  THE FORUM </p><p>HAS ARTICULATED POPULAR DEMANDS BUT DECLINED BECOMING </p><p>A POLITICAL PARTY.  ITS GREATEST SUCCESS, SO FAR, HAS BEEN </p><p>IN MOBILIZING MASS DEMONSTRATIONS AND SUPPORT FOR A </p><p>GENERAL STRIKE.  THESE TOPPLED THE OLD COMMUNIST </p><p>PARTY LEADERSHIP AND FORCED THE GOVERNMENT (AND THE </p><p>PARTY STANDING BEHIND IT) RELUCTANTLY INTO A DIALOGUE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE FORUM\'S REPRESENTATIVES ARE CAREFUL NOT TO </p><p>EXAGGERATE THE CONCESSIONS, SPECIFICALLY AN END TO </p><p>THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S "LEADING </p><p>ROLE," THAT THIS DIALOGUE HAS PRODUCED UP TO NOW. </p><p>THE FORUM\'S OBJECTIVES ARE MUCH BROADER.  IT WANTS </p><p>NOTHING LESS THAN TO PREPARE THE GROUNDWORK FOR FREE </p><p>ELECTIONS AND CONVERSION OF THE PRESENT </p><p>TOTALITARIAN SYSTEM TO DEMOCRACY.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE REGIME TO ACHIEVE THIS HAVE ONLY </p><p>BEGUN; THAT THEY WILL BE COMPLEX.  EVEN AFTER THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT PRODUCES A NEW COALITION OF "EXPERTS" ON </p><p>DECEMBER 3 AS PRIME MINISTER ADAMEC HAS PROMISED, THE </p><p>FORUM EXPECTS DELAYING TACTICS, PROVOCATIONS AND </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO PLAY ON ITS INTERNAL DIVISIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THOSE DIVISIONS ARE VERY REAL.  REPRESENTED WITHIN </p><p>THE FORUM ARE POLITICAL GROUPINGS THAT RANGE FROM </p><p>REFORM COMMUNIST (THE RENEWAL GROUP) TO LIBERAL </p><p>(THE DEMOCRATIC INITIATIVE).  SLOVAKS ARE REPRESENTED </p><p>BY THEIR OWN SEPARATE PRO-DEMOCRACY ORGANIZATION, </p><p>THE PUBLIC AGAINST VIOLENCE.  STUDENT GROUPS WHICH </p><p>BEGAN THE STRIKE FOR CHANGE SEEM IRRITATED THAT THE </p><p>FORUM HAS TAKEN OVER THE PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT </p><p>FROM THEM.  WORKERS, AFTER FLEXING THEIR MUSCLES IN THE </p><p>NOVEMBER 27 GENERAL STRIKE, SEEM READIER TO SUPPORT </p><p>MORE INDUSTRIAL ACTION THAN THE INTELLECTUALS AND </p><p>PROFESSIONALS HEADING THE FORUM. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE FORUM IS TRYING TO PLAY THESE DIVISIONS DOWN </p><p>BY EMPHASIZING ITS TRANSITIONAL, NON-POLITICAL </p><p>CHARACTER AND BY KEEPING ITS SUPPORTERS\' ATTENTION </p><p>ON ITS LONGER TERM GOALS FOR SOCIETY:  A MIXED </p><p>ECONOMY, A PLURALISTIC POLITICAL SYSTEM AND </p><p>CZECHOSLOVAKIA\'S INTEGRATION INTO WESTERN EUROPE. </p><p>INTERESTINGLY, THE FORUM\'S SEVEN CHAPTER PROGRAM </p><p>STATEMENT (PRAGUE 8312) NOT ONCE MENTIONS THE WORD </p><p>"SOCIALISM." </p><p> </p><p>THE COMMUNIST PARTY, DOWN BUT NOT OUT </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS OF THIS REVOLUTION, THE </p><p>CPCZ\' AUTHORITY AND CONTROL OF SOCIETY HAS BEEN </p><p>ENORMOUSLY ERODED.  INTERNAL SPLITS HAVE DEVELOPED. </p><p>A REFORM-MINDED PARTY GROUP HAS SET UP THE </p><p>"DEMOCRATIC FORUM," CALLING FOR A RE-EVALUATION OF </p><p>1968 AND RE-ADMISSION OF PURGED PRAGUE SPRING </p><p>FIGURES.  THE ELIMINATION OF PARTY CONTROL OVER THE </p><p>MEDIA HAS BEEN DRAMATIC, AS TELEVISION AND RADIO NEWS- </p><p>CASTERS OVERNIGHT BEGAN TO FUNCTION LIKE THEIR </p><p>WESTERN COUNTERPARTS.  THE PARTY HAS FORESWORN USE </p><p>OF FORCE IN A CENTRAL COMMITTEE RESOLUTION, THOUGH </p><p>QUALIFYING THIS COMMITMENT BY REFERRING TO A NEED </p><p>TO DEFEND LIFE, PROPERTY AND "THE FUNDAMENTALS OF </p><p>SOCIALISM." </p><p> </p><p>9.  ALTHOUGH REELING, THE PARTY IS NOT A SPENT </p><p>FORCE, HOWEVER, AND IT WILL NOT WILLINGLY </p><p>COMMIT POLITICAL SUICIDE BY MOVING TO FREE </p><p>ELECTIONS.  IN A SPEECH ON NOVEMBER 28, THE </p><p>NEW GENERAL SECRETARY KAREL URBANEK HAS CALLED </p><p>ON HIS CADRES TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE AND SEEK </p><p>TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE NOW LARGELY REFORM- </p><p>MINDED MEDIA.  HE HAS REJECTED RECENT CALLS BY </p><p>THE FORUM TO ABOLISH THE PEOPLE\'S MILITIA, </p><p>REMOVE PARTY FIGURES AS FACTORY MANAGERS AND </p><p>ELIMINATE BASIC PARTY ORGANIZATIONS IN </p><p>ENTERPRISES.  URBANEK PLANS TO TRAVEL TO MOSCOW </p><p>IN EARLY DECEMBER AND WILL CERTAINLY BE SEEKING </p><p>SOME SIGN OF GORBACHEV\'S SUPPORT FOR HIS PARTY </p><p>AND ITS FUTURE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  DESPITE ITS DISARRAY, THE CPCZ STILL HOLDS </p><p>SOME STRONG CARDS.  THE PARTY STILL DOMINATES </p><p>IMPORTANT SOCIETAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>SECURITY FORCES, AND STILL IS THE PREDOMINANT </p><p>FORCE IN THE NATIONAL FRONT, AND WILL CONTINUE </p><p>TO BE SO EVEN AFTER ITS LEGAL BASIS FOR THAT </p><p>CONTROL IS ELIMINATED.  IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT </p><p>THE REGIME HAS CHOSEN THE FRONT AS THE FRAMEWORK </p><p>FOR DIALOGUE WITH THE CIVIC FORUM, THEREBY </p><p>TRYING TO PRESENT THE FORUM AS THE "OPPOSITION" </p><p>TO ESTABLISHED, PARTY-CONTROLLED INSTITUTIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHERE THE REVOLUTION IS HEADED </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  VALTR KOMAREK, AN ECONOMIST TOUTED BY SOME AS </p><p>POSSIBLE MINISTERIAL CANDIDATE IN A NEW COALITION </p><p>GOVERNMENT, WAS ASKED THIS WEEK HOW LONG IT WOULD </p><p>TAKE CZECHOSLOVAKIA TO CONVERT INTO A WESTERN-STYLE </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  HE RESPONDED THAT THE COUNTRY DID NOT NEED </p><p>TO RECEIVE DEMOCRACY IN DRIBS AND DRABS; THE PEOPLE </p><p>COULD SWALLOW IT WHOLE.  IF THE COMMUNISTS CAN BE </p><p>FORCED TO LET THE COUNTRY\'S LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS </p><p>CONFORM TO THE PEOPLE\'S WILL, HE SAID, CZECHOSLOVAKIA </p><p>COULD RESUME ITS REFORMIST, DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS </p><p>ALMOST OVERNIGHT.  THAT IS AN ASSESSMENT THE </p><p>EMBASSY SHARES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE  BRAKE ON THIS TRANSITION WILL BE THE </p><p>ONE APPLIED BY THE PRESENT REGIME\'S LEADERSHIP AS </p><p>IT MANEUVERS TO DELAY THE DATE OF REFORMS, </p><p>PARTICULARLY FREE ELECTIONS.  THE REGIME HAS A NUMBER </p><p>OF ROADBLOCKS, POLITICAL AND LEGAL, IT CAN PUT IN THE </p><p>WAY.  AS GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY, </p><p>JAN SKODA, HAS POINTED OUT TO US, MOVING UP THE </p><p>DATE OF ELECTIONS WILL REQUIRE A TWO-THIRDS VOTE </p><p>OF THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY.  THIS IS SOMETHING THE </p><p>ASSEMBLY, A MAJORITY OF WHOSE MEMBERS ARE COMMUNIST </p><p>AND LIKELY TO BE VOTED OUT, MAY  BE UNREADY TO AGREE </p><p>TO.  HOWEVER, THE CZECH AND SLOVAK TENDENCY TOWARDS </p><p>CONSENSUS AND LOSS OF LEGITIMACY BY THE CPCZ </p><p>HIERARCHY SUGGEST THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS AS WELL </p><p>AS OTHER FUNCTIONARIES WILL MOVE RAPIDLY TO </p><p>SHOW "REFORMIST" COLORS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  QUICK ELECTIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN THE CIVIC </p><p>FORUM\'S INTEREST.  MANY OF THE POLITICAL GROUPS IT </p><p>REPRESENTS ARE ONLY IN AN EMBRYONIC STATE AND WILL </p><p>NEED MORE TIME TO ORGANIZE.  IN THE MEANTIME, AS </p><p>THE FORUM\'S LIST OF DEMANDS SUBMITTED TO ADAMEC ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 28 (SEPTEL) INDICATES, IT WILL FOCUS ON </p><p>THE PERSONNEL AND LEGAL CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM </p><p>NECESSARY TO ASSURE A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION </p><p>TOWARDS DEMOCRACY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RUSSELL </p><p></p></div>
