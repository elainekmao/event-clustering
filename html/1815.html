(U) THE ZIMBABWE SUPREME COURT DEFERRED INDEFINITELY </p><p>A DECISION IN OPPOSITION MDC PRESIDENT MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S CHALLENGE OF SECTIONS OF THE LAW AND ORDER </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>MAINTENANCE ACT (LOMA) AFTER HEARING ARGUMENTS FROM </p><p>TSVANGIRAI\'S AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S ATTORNEYS ON JULY 12. </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE HAS CHARGED TSVANGIRAI WITH </p><p>INCITEMENT AND TERRORISM FOR PUBLIC REMARKS IN SEPTEMBER </p><p>2000 IN WHICH THE MDC LEADER SAID ZIMBABWEANS WOULD </p><p>REMOVE PRESIDENT MUGABE BY FORCE IF HE DID NOT "GO </p><p>PEACEFULLY."  AFTER HEARING BOTH SIDES, JUSTICE WILSON </p><p>SANDURA NOTED THAT THE LOMA WAS PASSED BY THE RHODESIAN </p><p>REGIME IN AN ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS DEMOCRACY, ACCORDING TO </p><p>THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS."  CHRIS ANDERSEN, THE </p><p>ATTORNEY REPRESENTING TSVANGIRAI, REPORTEDLY STATED THAT </p><p>IF THE SUPREME COURT RULES THE LOMA SECTIONS </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL AND TSVANGIRAI\'S CASE GOES TO TRIAL IN </p><p>THE HIGH COURT, HE WOULD SUBPOENA ATTORNEY-GENERAL </p><p>ANDREW CHIGOVERA ON HIS SELECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE </p><p>LAW. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT:  TSVANGIRAI\'S CASE IS THE FIRST MAJOR </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL CASE TO COME BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>SINCE CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY GUBBAY STEPPED ASIDE IN </p><p>MARCH.  ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU HAS NOT </p><p>YET BEEN FORMALLY APPOINTED CHIEF JUSTICE, AND THIS </p><p>COULD BE A FACTOR IN THE COURT\'S DECISION TO DEFER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02173  131041Z </p><p>JUDGMENT.  IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER CHIDYAUSIKU, AS ACTING </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE AND A KNOWN ZANU-PF STOOGE, HAS THE CLOUT </p><p>TO CONVINCE THE OTHER JUSTICES THAT THE LOMA SECTIONS </p><p>ARE CONSTITUTIONAL.  RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OTHER </p><p>JUSTICES TELL US THE REST OF THE BENCH FAVORS STRIKING </p><p>DOWN THE LOMA SECTIONS IN QUESTION.  IT MAY BE </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU\'S INTENTION TO DELAY A JUDGMENT AS LONG AS </p><p>POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY HANGING OVER </p><p>THE MDC LEADER AND TO GIVE HIMSELF MORE TIME TO FIGURE </p><p>OUT HOW TO PRODUCE AN OUTCOME FAVORABLE TO THE RULING </p><p>PARTY.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>WOERNER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
