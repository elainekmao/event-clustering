<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L DAMASCUS 04001 </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, SY, LY, IR </p><p>SUBJECT:  ASAD CONGRATULATES QADHAFI ON RUPTURE WITH IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) DAMASCUS 3952, B) DAMASCUS 3787 </p><p>- </p><p>1.  (U) THE SYRIAN PRESS CARRIES AS SEPARATE ITEMS JUNE 27 </p><p>ASAD\'S TELEPHQNE CALL TO QADHAFI ON JUNE 26 AND THE NEWS </p><p>OF LIBYA\'S APPEAL FOR THE EXPULSION OF IRAQ FROM THE </p><p>ARAB LEAGUE AND ISLAMIC CONFERENCE ORGANIZATION.  TRIPOLI </p><p>RADIO (FBIS LD262238) ELUCIDATES THAT, IN HIS CALL, </p><p>ASAD "DENOUNCED" IRAQ\'S SEVERANCE OF RELATIONS WITH </p><p>LIBYA AND CONFIRMED SYRIA\'S SUPPORT FOR LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT:  FROM ASAD\'S PERSPECTIVE, QADHAFI HAS </p><p>COME BACK TO HIS SENSES, AND DONE SO IN AN EVEN BETTER </p><p>WAY THAN COULD HAVE BEEN HOPED FOR ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO. </p><p>TURAYKI\'S TRIP TO BAGHDAD, ON THE HEELS OF COMING TO </p><p>DAMASCUS, MUST HAVE GIVEN THE SYRIANS SOME PAUSE.  BUT </p><p>ANY SYRIAN CONCERN HAS BEEN MORE THAN WASHED AWAY IN A </p><p>FLOOD OF IRAQI-LIBYAN RECRIMINATIONS.  THE RAMADAN WAR </p><p>OF THE CAMPS, AS THE SYRIANS PORTRAY IT, HAS BEEN </p><p>SUCCESSFULY CONCLUDED; IN ANY EVENT, QADHAFI IS NO LONGER </p><p>TALKING ABOUT THE PALESTINIAN  PREDICAMENT IN LEBANON IN </p><p>WAYS THAT COME CLOSE TO ATTACKING SYRIA DIRECTLY.  WHILE </p><p>LEBANON WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM FOR SYRIA, </p><p>LIBYA, AND IRAN, THERE IS EVERY PROSPECT THAT THEY WILL </p><p>ALSO CONTINUE TO SEE EYE TO EYE ON IRAQ AND THE ARAB- </p><p>ISRAELI CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) BEIRUT MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. </p><p> </p><p>GLAGPIE </p><p></p></div>
