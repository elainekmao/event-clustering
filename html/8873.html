Maoists reportedly attacked a convoy headed to the far- </p><p>western district of Jajarkot to provide humanitarian </p><p>assistance.  In a meeting held this week, international aid </p><p>agencies reported increased Maoist activities that were </p><p>threatening aid projects. Kamal Thapa, Minister of </p><p>Information and Communications and newly appointed member of </p><p>the government\'s peace negotiating team, said the next round </p><p>of talks would be held soon, but offered no timeframe. </p><p>Senior-level Maoists reportedly are getting frustrated with </p><p>the delay in negotiating the third round of peace </p><p>negotiations, accusing both the Government of Nepal (GON) </p><p>and the USG for the delay.  Maoist negotiating team members </p><p>also have accused the GON of preparing to resume hostilities </p><p>with USG encouragement.  Insurgents abducted nine civilians </p><p>this week, allegedly torturing several of them during </p><p>captivity, and beat up several other civilians after </p><p>stealing grain and other goods from them.  The All Nepal </p><p>National Independent Students\' Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU- </p><p>R), the Maoist affiliated student organization, reportedly </p><p>is forcing young students to join its organization.  The </p><p>Royal Nepal Army (RNA) continues its "Hearts and Minds" </p><p>campaign (Reftel).  Seventeen more Maoists were released </p><p>from detention.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS ATTACK RNA HUMANITARIAN CONVOY </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  A convoy of Royal Nepal Army (RNA) soldiers, police and </p><p>civilians came under Maoist attack on June 18.  According to </p><p>press reports, the convoy was fired on by a group of three </p><p>hundred Maoists as it headed toward the far western district </p><p>of Jajarkot as part of the RNA\'s ongoing humanitarian </p><p>assistance efforts (Reftel).  According to an army </p><p>spokesman, the army returned fire and the confrontation </p><p>lasted over three hours.  (Note:  In the past, Maoists have </p><p>made attempts to disrupt health camps throughout different </p><p>districts, including issuing threats and orders against </p><p>villagers not to attend the camps, and cutting off water </p><p>supplies in the areas where the camps were being held. End </p><p>note).  In a statement released on June 19, the Ministry of </p><p>Defense strongly condemned the attack, and suggested it </p><p>would have adverse effects on the peace process.  There has </p><p>been no comment from the Maoists on the attack. The </p><p>humanitarian team said it will continue with the medical </p><p>camp as planned. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST ACTIIVITIES INCREASING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  In a meeting held this week, international aid agencies </p><p>presented alarming information on Maoist activity throughout </p><p>Nepal despite the ceasefire.  Extortion campaigns have </p><p>increased substantially, particularly during the past month, </p><p>and have disrupted some development projects and threaten to </p><p>halt others altogether.  Maoists reportedly also have </p><p>threatened to stop all foreign development projects if peace </p><p>talks fail, and have already prevented foreigners from </p><p>entering into one eastern district. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The international agencies also presented information </p><p>suggesting that Maoists have made it known that they oppose </p><p>employment projects because they interfere with Maoist </p><p>recruitment efforts. </p><p>THIRD ROUND OF TALKS TO BE HELD "SOON" </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>5.  Kamal Thapa, Minister of Information and Communications </p><p>and newly appointed member of the government\'s peace </p><p>negotiating team, said on June 14 that the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON) would hold the next round of talks "very soon," </p><p>but provided no specific timeframe.  Minister Thapa said he </p><p>was studying the agreements reached during the last two </p><p>rounds, and would sit for talks only after enough homework </p><p>had been done. </p><p> </p><p>MAOIST TEAM CRITICIZES DELAY IN TALKS; BLAMES U.S. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Senior-level Maoists reportedly are getting frustrated </p><p>with the delay in setting a date for the third round of </p><p>peace negotiations.  On June 17 Krishna Bahadur Mahara, </p><p>spokesman and member of the Maoist negotiating team, accused </p><p>the GON of delaying the peace talks under the pretext that </p><p>it needed time to study previous agreements.  Mahara claimed </p><p>the GON was "compelling the Maoists to go back to armed </p><p>struggle."  Mahara alleged the U.S. was responsible for the </p><p>delay in peace talks, but offered no further explanation. </p><p>However, the Maoist spokesman declared that the peace talks </p><p>would fail if the USG did not support them. </p><p> </p><p>7.  On June 14 Ram Bahadur Thapa, alias Badal, also a member </p><p>of the Maoist talk team, reportedly told a public gathering </p><p>in Sindhuli District that the GON was planning to announce </p><p>the collapse of the peace talks.  Badal accused the GON of </p><p>conspiring to get rid of the political parties and the </p><p>Maoists.  Matrika Prasad Yadav, a politburo member of the </p><p>Maoists, addressing a public rally in Bara District in the </p><p>Terai on June 14, concurred that by delaying the peace </p><p>process the GON was inviting war. </p><p> </p><p>MAOISTS CLAIM GON MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR WAR </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Maoist rhetoric of late is accusing the GON of preparing </p><p>to recommence hostilities.  Senior Maoists have lambasted </p><p>the RNA\'s purchase of new weapons, helicopters and ongoing </p><p>recruitment of additional personnel.  On June 14 Badal, </p><p>military chief of the Maoists, reportedly charged that the </p><p>GON is not only buying new weapons, but is also planning to </p><p>ask the USG for help to "crush the Maoists."  Badal </p><p>reiterated his previous accusations that preparations are </p><p>underway for the GON to impose military rule. </p><p> </p><p>INSURGENTS CONTINUE TERROR </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  A group of thirty-five armed Maoists reportedly abducted </p><p>four youths on June 17 in Sunsari District in the Terai, and </p><p>held them captive for twenty-two hours.  According to the </p><p>abductees, they were severely beaten and tortured during </p><p>their captivity.  Maoist cadres abducted the four and </p><p>accused them of being involved in the rape of a local woman. </p><p>Five laborers in Salyan District were abducted by insurgents </p><p>on June 15, and accused of digging without permission.  The </p><p>laborers had been repairing the roadside.  A journalist </p><p>working for a state-run newspaper was released on June 17 </p><p>after being held captive by the Maoists for twelve days. </p><p>Maoist cadres had abducted the journalist in Pokhara, </p><p>charging him with extorting money fraudulently in the name </p><p>of the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>10.  According to the local paper, Maoists in the districts </p><p>of Sindhuli and Siraha beat up several civilians and looted </p><p>their grain and other goods.  The estimated value of the </p><p>looted goods is almost two thousand dollars, a fortune in </p><p>the impoverished countryside. </p><p> </p><p>ANNISU-R FORCING STUDENTS TO JOIN ORGANIZATION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>11.  Karna Bahadur Shahi, President of National Private and </p><p>Boarding Schools Association Nepal (NPABSON), told the local </p><p>press on June 19 that the All Nepal National Independent </p><p>Students\' Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the Maoist </p><p>affiliated student organization, was forcing young students </p><p>to join its student group.  According to Shahi, members of </p><p>ANNISU-R storm into classrooms and threaten those who try to </p><p>resist.  Students are intimidated into providing their names </p><p>and phone numbers.  Shahi condemned these actions of the </p><p>ANNISU-R, and castigated them for using children as </p><p>political pawns. </p><p> </p><p>RNA MAKING LIFE BETTER </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) continues its "Hearts and </p><p>Minds" campaign(Reftel), providing humanitarian assistance </p><p>to some of the most remote and Maoist-affected districts of </p><p>Nepal.  On June 7 the RNA arrived in the mid-western </p><p>district of Baglung to provide medical assistance, and to </p><p>distribute clothes, paper supplies and food, and even gave </p><p>haircuts.  Assistance was also provided in obtaining </p><p>passports and citizenship papers.  According to press </p><p>reports, locals have welcomed the camps and declared that </p><p>"life has become much better." </p><p> </p><p>13.  On June 15 the RNA also held a two-day camp in Myagdi </p><p>District in mid-western Nepal.  Local press accounts </p><p>estimated that over fifteen thousand people received medical </p><p>help and relief supplies.  Farmers were given seeds for </p><p>planting and agricultural training.  According to the Chief </p><p>District Officer (CDO), the administration office </p><p>distributed citizenship papers to almost two hundred people. </p><p> </p><p>DISTRICT JAIL RELEASES ALL MAOIST PRISONERS </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  The District Administration Office (DAO) in Kapilvastu </p><p>reported on June 13 that its local jail now has no Maoist </p><p>prisoners following the release of seventeen Maoists on June </p><p>13. </p><p> </p><p>15.  On June 11 a joint team of army and police personnel </p><p>arrested seventeen Maoists in Kailali District on weapons </p><p>charges.  The insurgents reportedly were carrying grenades, </p><p>rifles and ammunition.  Police also arrested two student </p><p>members of the All Nepal National Independent Students\' </p><p>Union-Revolutionary (ANNISU-R), the Maoist-aligned student </p><p>organization, on June 14. </p><p> </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
