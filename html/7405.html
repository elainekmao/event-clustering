Ozturk said the EU has </p><p>not raised the issue with the GOT since August 2002, when </p><p>EU-candidate Romania\'s decision to sign an Article 98 </p><p>agreement led to EU demarches to the GOT and other </p><p>governments around the world.  He said the GOT is not facing </p><p>outside pressure to delay an agreement, and repeated reftel B </p><p>arguments that higher-level MFA officials believe the GOT </p><p>should delay an agreement due to the conflict in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
