(UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION OF DIPLOMATIC </p><p>NOTE IN PARA 4.)  HE CLAIMED THAT THIS RECOMMENDATION DID </p><p>NOT "SHOW GOODWILL," NOR WAS IT "USEFUL" IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>DIALOGUE ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.  HE </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT IT WAS "NOT GOOD" FOR THE PROMOTION OF </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONS, AND THAT IT WOULD "NOT HELP TO </p><p>ACCELERATE" THE PROCESSES OF DIALOGUE.  HE INSISTED THAT </p><p>INCLUDING VIETNAM ON THIS LIST WOULD BE "VERY BAD," ALTHOUGH </p><p>HE ADMITTED THAT DIALOGUE WAS BETTER THAN NO DIALOGUE.  HE </p><p>URGED AMBASSADOR TO CONVEY THIS CONCERN TO THE USG, WHICH </p><p>AMBASSADOR AGREED TO DO, WHILE ALSO REITERATING THE VALUE OF </p><p>DIALOGUE INCLUDING WHEN THE TWO SIDES DO NOT AGREE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  ACTOR:  AMBASSADOR RAISED THE CASE OF NOTED </p><p>VIETNAMESE ACTOR DON DUONG, WHO IS REPORTED BY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MEDIA (AS WELL AS IN NUMEROUS LETTERS FROM HOLLYWOOD </p><p>ENTERTAINMENT FIGURES) TO HAVE HAD HIS PASSPORT CONFISCATED </p><p>AND TO BE UNDER THE THREAT OF ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENTS BY </p><p>VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES.

(U)  APEC:  AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED TO AFM HUNG </p><p>ARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD BE IN PLACE AT THIS YEAR\'S APEC </p><p>LEADERS\' MEETING TO ALLOW FOR WHISPER INTERPRETERS AT THE </p><p>TWO SOCIAL EVENTS AND URGED THAT THE GVN PROVIDE ITS OWN </p><p>INTERPRETER FOR POSSIBLE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN PRESIDENT BUSH </p><p>AND PRIME MINISTER KHAI AT THE DINNER AND LUNCH.  AFM HUNG </p><p>NOTED THAT THE GVN HAD BEEN IN COORDINATION WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO ON THESE ARRANGEMENTS.

(UI)  INFORMAL TRANSLATION OF DIPLOMATIC NOTE: </p><p>NO. 407/NG-CM </p><p> </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF </p><p>VIETNAM PRESENTS ITS COMPLIMENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE </p><p>OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WOULD LIKE TO INFORM IT </p><p>THAT: </p><p> </p><p>ON 30 SEPTEMBER 2002, THE U.S. COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM SUBMITTED A REPORT TO RECOMMEND THAT THE </p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CLASSIFY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>VIETNAM IN A LIST OF COUNTRIES OF PARTICULAR CONCERN IN THE </p><p>AREA OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. THIS IS AN ACT THAT VERY MUCH </p><p>LACKS GOODWILL AND IS FULL OF FIXED VIEWS OF THE U.S. CIRF </p><p>TOWARD VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>IT NEEDS TO BE REAFFIRMED THAT IN VIETNAM THE RIGHT OF </p><p>FREEDOM OF BELIEF AND OF NON-BELIEF IS GUARANTEED BY THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION AND IS EXERCISED IN REAL LIFE IN THE SOCIALIST </p><p>REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM.  THE REALITY OF THIS RIGHT OF FREEDOM </p><p>HAS BEEN WIDELY RECOGNIZED BY THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC </p><p>OPINION, INCLUDING THE OBJECTIVE PUBLIC OPINION OF US </p><p>CITIZENS. </p><p> </p><p>IN THE LARGER INTERESTS OF VIETNAM-US RELATIONS, WHICH ARE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02369  01 OF 02  011045Z </p><p>EXPANDING, AND WITH AN ATTITUDE OF GOODWILL, VIETNAM </p><p>RECEIVED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE USCIRF IN FEBRUARY 2002 SO </p><p>THAT THEY COULD WITNESS BIG CHANGES IN VIETNAM WITH THEIR </p><p>OWN EYES.  THE COMMISSION ALSO RECEIVED ADDITIONAL </p><p>INFORMATION THROUGH MEETING WITH VIETNAM\'S DELEGATION OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN WASHINGTON IN MAY 2002.  HOWEVER, </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY THIS COMMISSION STILL DELIBERATELY EVALUATED </p><p>THE RELIGIOUS SITUATION IN VN INCORRECTLY AND SUBMITTED A </p><p>NON-CONSTRUCTIVE RECOMMENDATION.  WE DEEM THE ABOVE </p><p>RECOMMENDATION, IF ACCEPTED AND APPROVED, WILL NOT HELP THE </p><p>PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTIVE AND CANDID DIALOGUE AIMED AT </p><p>STRENGTHENING MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PEOPLES OF </p><p>THE TWO COUNTRIES, AND IT WILL AFFECT NEGATIVELY THE </p><p>BENEFICIAL AND DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VIETNAM AND </p><p>THE UNITED STATES. </p><p> </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF </p><p>VIETNAM STRONGLY REQUESTS THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE </p><p>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA NOT TO ACCEPT THE ABOVE- MENTIONED </p><p>RECOMMENDATION FULL OF FIXED IDEAS OF THE USCIRF. </p><p> </p><p>THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF </p><p>VIETNAM AVAILS ITSELF OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RENEW TO THE </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ4440 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02369  02 OF 02  011045Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  COME-00  DODE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      DS-00    EB-00    E-00     FBIE-00  UTED-00  VC-00    TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00   NSAE-00  OES-01   SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /004W </p><p>                  ------------------EF825E  011046Z /38 </p><p>R 011046Z OCT 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7671 </p><p>INFO AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY MEXICO </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002369 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EAP/BCLTV AND DRL/RF </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THE </p><p>ASSURANCES OF ITS HIGHEST CONSIDERATION. </p><p> </p><p>1 OCTOBER 2002 </p><p>END TEXT </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02369  02 OF 02  011045Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
