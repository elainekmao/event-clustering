<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 06 CAIRO 12383 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR ROSENBLATT, LONDON FOR MILLIKAN </p><p>DEPT ALSO FOR INR/B </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PINR, KISL, PINS, KPRP, EG </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE GREAT SHAYKHS:  THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND </p><p>THE RADICAL FRINGE </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. POLITICAL ISLAM IN EGYPT IS GENERALLY DIVIDED INTO </p><p>ESTABLISHMENT ISLAM REPRESENTED BY THE RELATIVELY </p><p>MODERATE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD (MB), AND THE RADICAL FRINGE </p><p>REPRESENTED BY OMAR ABDURRAHMAN AND COMPANY.  THESE </p><p>GROUPS COMPETE FOR RECRUITS, STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF THE </p><p>MOSQUES AND DEMONSTRATE DIFFERENT ATTITUDES TOWARD THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  THE DISTINCTIONS AMONG THEM, HOWEVER, ARE </p><p>NOT ALWAYS VERY TIDY.  STARTING FROM THE ISLAMIC </p><p>PRINCIPLES OF "SHURA" (CONSULTATION) AND "TASALUH" </p><p>(RECONCILIATION OF DIFFERENCES AMONG BELIEVERS), THERE </p><p>IS CONSIDERABLE DIALOGUE, DEBATE, AND EFFORT AT </p><p>RAPPROCHEMENT EVEN AMONG GROUPS THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN </p><p>BLOODY CLASHES WITH EACH OTHER.  THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </p><p>SEEMS TO HAVE CHARGED DEPUTY SUPREME GUIDE MUSTAFA </p><p>MASHHOUR WITH CONDUCTING LIAISON WITH THE EGYPTIAN AND </p><p>THE REGIONAL RADICAL FRINGE. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>PUSHING THE BROTHERHOOD TOWARD RADICALISM? </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  FOR YEARS THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD WAS AN UNDERGROUND </p><p>ORGANIZATION PRONE TO VIOLENCE.  IN THEORY, THE BROTHERS </p><p>RENOUNCED VIOLENCE IN 1987 AND DECIDED TO PLAY BY THE </p><p>RULES OF THE FORMAL EGYPTIAN POLITICAL GAME.  THIS </p><p>DECISION APPEARS NOT TO HAVE BEEN UNANIMOUS.  SOME OF </p><p>THE MORE MILITANT BROTHERS, MUSTAFA MASHHOUR FOREMOST </p><p>AMONG THEM, RETAIN AT LEAST A THEORETICAL ATTACHMENT TO </p><p>THE USE OF VIOLENCE FOR THE SAKE OF ISLAM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  INDEED, MANY ESTABLISHMENT ISLAMIC AND SECULAR </p><p>FIGURES INSIST THAT THE BROTHERHOOD\'S DECISION TO PLAY </p><p>THE POLITICAL GAME WAS A MERE PLOY -- THAT THE BROTHERS </p><p>ARE STILL INVOLVED IN ISLAMIC VIOLENCE OR AT LEAST </p><p>KINDLE THE OPTION TO USE FORCE.  MUSTAFA MASHHOUR, THEY </p><p>CLAIM, IS THE HEAD OF THE "AL-JIHAZ AL-SIRRI" ("THE </p><p>SECRET ORGAN") OF THE GROUP, AND AS SUCH, EITHER DIRECTS </p><p>OR COOPERATES IN THE ORCHESTRATION OF VIOLENT ACTS. </p><p>SOME SPECULATE THAT MASHHOUR LENDS PEOPLE AND ASSETS </p><p>(SAFE HOUSES FOR EXAMPLE) TO ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.  OTHERS </p><p>SAY HIS STRATEGY IS TO SEEK CONTROL OF THE RADICAL </p><p>GROUPS BY SENDING HIS FOLLOWERS TO JOIN AND EVENTUALLY </p><p>RISE TO POSITIONS OF INFLUENCE OR LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE </p><p>GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MASHHOUR ASPIRES TO BE THE SUPREME GUIDE OF THE </p><p>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SUCCEEDING THE FEEBLE OCTOGENARIAN </p><p>HAMED ABU AL-NASR.  TO DO SO, HE WILL HAVE TO BEAT BACK </p><p>THE CHALLENGE OF MAMOUN AL-HODEIBI, THE HEAD OF THE </p><p>BROTHERHOOD\'S PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION IN THE 1987-90 </p><p>PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY.  AL-HODEIBI, REPUTEDLY THE CHIEF </p><p>ADVOCATE OF PARTICIPATION IN EGYPT\'S POLITICAL GAME, </p><p>EARNED THE GRUDGING RESPECT OF NON-ISLAMISTS FOR HIS </p><p>WORK IN THE ASSEMBLY:  THE DEPUTIES HE SHEPHERDED PROVED </p><p>THE MOST COHESIVE AND HARDWORKING OF THE OPPOSITION </p><p>GROUPINGS.  AS LONG AS PARTICIPATION REMAINS THE </p><p>BROTHERHOOD\'S POLICY, AL-HODEIBI HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN THE </p><p>SUCCESSION STRUGGLE.  THE CYNICS -- AND IT IS HARD TO BE </p><p>TOO CYNICAL IN EGYPTIAN POLITICS -- SAY THAT MASHHOUR IS </p><p>TRYING HARD TO DIMINISH AL-HODEIBI\'S ADVANTAGE BY </p><p>PUSHING THE ORGANIZATION TOWARD CONFRONTATION WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND A CONCOMITANT RADICALIZATION.  THUS, IN </p><p>THE LAST FEW MONTHS MASHHOUR HAS ATTENDED RADICAL </p><p>ISLAMIC CONFERENCES IN PAKISTAN AND KHARTOUM, HAS </p><p>SPURNED HIS OLD FRIENDS IN SAUDI ARABIA, HAS URGED </p><p>WORLDWIDE JIHAD WITH THE LIKES OF SUDAN\'S AL-TURABI AND </p><p>TUNISIA\'S AL-GHANNOUSHI, AND HAS FORMULATED THE </p><p>BROTHERHOOD\'S STATEMENT ON PALESTINE, THE RADICAL </p><p>CONTENTS AND TONE OF WHICH ARE FAR FROM THE MB\'S </p><p>DOMESTIC FOCUS AND MODERATE RHETORIC OF THE RECENT PAST. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE BATTLE FOR LEADERSHIP WILL BE JOINED SOON.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS AWARE OF THE POLITICAL DYNAMIC AT WORK IN </p><p>THE BROTHERHOOD, AND WILL NO DOUBT TRY TO INFLUENCE THE </p><p>GROUP\'S DECISION.  A VICTORY BY AL-HODEIBI WOULD </p><p>PROBABLY PRODUCE A POLICY MUCH LIKE THAT OF THE LAST </p><p>FOUR YEARS:  RHETORICAL COOPERATION WITH OTHER </p><p>OPPOSITION ELEMENTS AND PATIENCE IN THE GRADUAL </p><p>ISLAMIZATION OF EGYPT\'S PUBLIC LIFE.  A VICTORY BY </p><p>MASHHOUR WOULD LIKELY PRODUCE A MUCH MORE STRIDENT TONE, </p><p>AND PERHAPS EVEN A DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THE FORMAL </p><p>POLITICAL GAME.  SUCH A MOVE WOULD SET IN MOTION A </p><p>RADICAL DYNAMIC WHICH REASONABLY COULD BE EXPECTED TO </p><p>END IN VIOLENCE, GIVING THE AUTHORITIES AN EXCUSE TO </p><p>CRACK DOWN. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>SPENT FORCES:  SALAMA, KISHK, AL-BADRI </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  DURING THE LATE SEVENTIES AND EARLY EIGHTIES, HAFEZ </p><p>SALAMA FROM HIS MOSQUES IN SUEZ AND CAIRO AND ABDEL </p><p>HAMID KISHK FROM HIS IN THE QUBBA QUARTER OF CAIRO, WERE </p><p>TWO OF THE MOST INCENDIARY CRITICS OF THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>PARTICULARLY ON CAMP DAVID AND EGYPT\'S SPECIAL </p><p>RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES.  BOTH STRESSED THE </p><p>NEED TO "STRUGGLE" -- USUALLY UNDERSTOOD AS A CODE WORD </p><p>FOR THE USE OF VIOLENCE -- FOR THE SAKE OF ISLAM. </p><p>SALAMA HAD EXTRA CREDIBILITY BECAUSE OF HIS RECORD AS A </p><p>HERO IN THE WARS AGAINST ISRAEL.  KISHK\'S CHARISMA WAS </p><p>MAGNIFIED THROUGH THE SALE OF TAPES OF HIS SERMONS.  AT </p><p>THE TIME, MANY THOUGHT THAT IF EGYPT WAS TO HAVE AN </p><p>ISLAMIC REVOLUTION, THESE TWO WOULD BE MAJOR FORCES </p><p>BEHIND AND BENEFICIARIES OF SUCH A DEVELOPMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  BOTH ARE STILL ACTIVE, BUT THEIR INFLUENCE HAS </p><p>WANED.  OTHER THAN BLEATING A FEW PERFUNCTORY REMARKS </p><p>ABOUT THE "SHAME" OF MUSLIM FIGHTING MUSLIM AND SALAMA\'S </p><p>REMARK ABOUT THE "SHAME" OF CALLING IN WESTERN </p><p>ASSISTANCE, BOTH WERE LARGELY SILENT DURING THE LONG </p><p>MONTHS OF THE GULF CRISIS.  SECURITY SURVEILLANCE </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY HELPS LIMIT THEIR ACTIVITIES, BUT AGE AND </p><p>ILL HEALTH -- TO WHICH THEIR RADICAL COLLEAGUE SALAH ABU </p><p>ISMAIL SURRENDERED LAST YEAR -- ARE ALSO PART OF THE </p><p>EQUATION.  BOTH ARE IN THEIR SIXTIES WITH THE </p><p>PREDICTABLE GERIATRIC PLAINTS SETTING IN.  KISHK SEEMS </p><p>TO BE FADING GRACEFULLY:  HIS NEWEST TAPES ARE DEVOID OF </p><p>POLITICAL CONTENT AND TEND TO WAX METAPHYSICAL ABOUT THE </p><p>MYSTERIES OF THE VIRGIN BIRTH OF THE PROPHET JESUS AND </p><p>THE PROPHET MOHAMMED\'S ASCENT TO HEAVEN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  BY CONTRAST, HAFEZ SALAMA IS NOT GOING GENTLY INTO </p><p>THE GOOD NIGHT.  INDEED, MOST REFERENCES TO SALAMA HAVE </p><p>HIM ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT OF TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH </p><p>HIM POLITICALLY OR PHYSICALLY.  HE HAS ACCUSED THE </p><p>INTERIOR MINISTRY OF FORCING THE EDUCATION MINISTRY TO </p><p>PLAY BUREAUCRATIC GAMES WITH THE LICENSING OF THE </p><p>PRIVATE SCHOOLS ASSOCIATED WITH HIS HEDAYA MOSQUE </p><p>COMPLEX IN SUEZ.  AT ONE POINT HE ACCUSED STATE SECURITY </p><p>OF ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION BY FORCING HIS CAR OFF THE </p><p>REMOTE SUEZ-CAIRO DESERT ROAD.  OTHER ISLAMIC </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS SUGGEST THAT SALAMA\'S MORE SERIOUS </p><p>ACCUSATIONS ARE TO GENERATE PUBLIC ATTENTION AND </p><p>SYMPATHY TO REVIVE AN ISLAMIC CAREER IN DECLINE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  ANOTHER ISLAMIC FIGURE WHO HAS RUN OUT OF POLITICAL </p><p>STEAM IS SHAYKH YOUSSEF AL-BADRI, FORMERLY A MEMBER OF </p><p>THE PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY.  SHAYKH YOUSSEF NEVER ACHIEVED </p><p>THE FOLLOWING OR REPUTATION OF KISHK OR SALAMA, BUT, AS </p><p>HIS ONGOING EFFORTS TO OBTAIN A LICENSE FOR A NEW </p><p>ISLAMIC POLITICAL PARTY ATTEST, HE ASPIRES TO ISLAMIC </p><p>GREATNESS.  CLEARLY, HOWEVER, AL-BADRI\'S FORTUNES HAVE </p><p>WANED.  A SO-CALLED "WORLD PRESS CONFERENCE" ON THE GULF </p><p>CRISIS ADVERTISED BY AL-BADRI LAST AUGUST DREW PERHAPS </p><p>TWO HUNDRED LISTLESS ATTENDEES INCLUDING TWO JOURNALISTS </p><p>AND ONE AMERICAN DIPLOMAT.  AL-BADRI\'S COUP DE GRACE </p><p>CAME IN LAST FALL\'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WHEN, IN THE </p><p>MOST FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN EGYPTIAN HISTORY, THE </p><p>SHAYKH SUFFERED AN EMBARRASSING DEFEAT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>ABDEL RASHID SAQR:  A HARSH NEW VOICE </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  ABDEL RASHID SAQR, THE FORMER IMAM OF THE SALAH </p><p>AL-DIN MOSQUE IN CAIRO\'S MANIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, IS A NEW </p><p>AND STRIDENT VOICE FOR ISLAMIC MILITANCY.  THE MAY 1990 </p><p>MARCH EMANATING FROM HIS MOSQUE WAS THE LAST SIGNIFICANT </p><p>ISLAMIC STREET ACTION IN CAIRO.  A MARK OF SAQR\'S </p><p>POLITICAL CLEVERNESS WAS HIS MELDING OF THE ISSUES OF </p><p>PROTEST:  HE USED FRIDAY PRAYERS TO URGE THE </p><p>CONGREGATION TO TAKE TO THE STREETS IN PROTEST OF BOTH </p><p>THE INTERIOR MINISTRY\'S ARREST POLICY AND A ROUND OF </p><p>PRICE INCREASES ON GOVERNMENT-SUPPLIED COMMODITIES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE DEMONSTRATION COST SAQR HIS MOSQUE AS THE AWQAF </p><p>MINISTRY TRANSFERRED HIM TO A "HALL-WALKER" SLOT IN THE </p><p>MINISTRY ITSELF, BUT OVER THE INTERVENING MONTHS THE </p><p>SHAYKH HAS SHOWN A TENDENCY TO BE VOCALLY RADICAL ON A </p><p>WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES.  KNOWING A JUICY ISSUE WHEN HE </p><p>SEES IT, SAQR IMMEDIATELY DENOUNCED THE INVASION OF </p><p>KUWAIT BUT WENT ON AT LENGTH AGAINST THE DISPARITIES IN </p><p>ARAB WEALTH THAT HAD "LED" TO THE DISASTER.  IN OTHER </p><p>STATEMENTS, SAQR HAS DECLARED THAT JERUSALEM WILL NEVER </p><p>BE RECOVERED BY NEGOTIATIONS, AND THAT STRUGGLE BETWEEN </p><p>MUSLIMS AND JEWS IS A POSTULATE OF LIFE FOR THE </p><p>FAITHFUL.  SAQR ALSO LIKES TO RE-PLAY ONE OF THE </p><p>FAVORITE CONSPIRACY THEORIES OF IGNORANT MUSLIMS:  E.G., </p><p>THAT THE MUSLIM WORLD IS BESET BY CHRISTIAN AND </p><p>"CHRISTIANIZING" SCHEMES.  PLAYING ON THE LOCAL TENDENCY </p><p>TO MISTRUST ANY FIGURE OF AUTHORITY, SAQR LIKES TO </p><p>EXPOUND ON THE THEME THAT AL-AZHAR -- WHICH SHOULD BE </p><p>THE SYMBOL OF ISLAMIC PURITY AND EGYPT\'S LEADERSHIP OF </p><p>WORLD.ISLAM -- IS RIFE WITH CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY. </p><p> </p><p>13.  SAQR SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING OF A LONER.  THERE ARE </p><p>RUMORS THAT HE WAS ONCE A MUSLIM BROTHER, BUT ON AT </p><p>LEAST A FEW OCCASIONS HE REPORTEDLY HAS LAMBASTED THE </p><p>MB\'S WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM.  HE DENOUNCES THE INTERIOR </p><p>MINISTRY\'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE RADICAL FRINGE.  BUT HIS </p><p>GOAL SEEMS MORE DENUNCIATION OF THE GOE THAN SUPPORT FOR </p><p>THE "AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYYA" (IG). </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>ADEL HUSSEIN:  A LINK TO SECULARISM </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  ADEL HUSSEIN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE SOCIALIST </p><p>LABOR PARTY\'S WEEKLY NEWSPAPER "AL-SHAAB," DIFFERS FROM </p><p>OTHER PERSONALITIES DISCUSSED IN THIS MESSAGE IN ONE </p><p>FUNDAMENTAL RESPECT:  HE ARGUABLY IS NOT EVEN AN </p><p>ISLAMIST.  ADEL SPENT LONG YEARS AS A SELF-DESCRIBED </p><p>"COMMUNIST," UNDERGROUND IN NASSER\'S AND SADAT\'S </p><p>PRISONS, AND AS AN OVERT HARD-LEFT JOURNALIST.  ADEL </p><p>INSISTS THAT HIS EXPOSURE TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERS IN </p><p>PRISON LED HIM TO THE LIGHT OF ISLAM, BUT MOST "REAL" </p><p>ISLAMISTS AND LEFTISTS SLIP HIM IN THE SAME POLITICAL </p><p>PIGEONHOLE AS SLP LEADER IBRAHIM SHUKRI:  I.E., A </p><p>POLITICIAN WHO SAW THE INTELLECTUAL EXHAUSTION OF THE </p><p>FITIES AND SIXTIES AND DECIDED TO RIDE THE ISLAMIC WAVE </p><p>LAPPING AT EGYPT\'S POLITICAL SHORES IN THE LATE </p><p>SEVENTIES.  NEVERTHELESS, HE MORE THAN ANY OTHER </p><p>EGYPTIAN PUBLICLY LINKS ISLAM TO CALLS FOR RADICAL </p><p>ACTION. </p><p> </p><p>15.  ADEL HUSSEIN HAS NO ISLAMIC FOLLOWING PER SE.  HE </p><p>IS NOT A SHAYKH, HAS NO FORMAL RELIGIOUS TRAINING, GIVES </p><p>SEMINARS AT SLP HEADQUARTERS RATHER THAN SERMONS AT </p><p>FRIDAY PRAYERS, AND -- PROOF POSITIVE OF HIS SECULARISM </p><p>TO ISLAMISTS -- HAS AN UNVEILED WIFE.  ADEL IS </p><p>POLITICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN ISLAMIC TERMS, HOWEVER, </p><p>BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW WHO SEEK TO UNIFY THE </p><p>ANTI-GOVERNMENT EFFORTS OF DISPARATE OPPOSITION ELEMENTS </p><p>BY USING THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR OF ISLAMIC </p><p>RHETORIC.  HE ALSO SEES THAT POLITICAL ISLAM HAS IGNORED </p><p>THE ECONOMIC ISSUES ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS THE MOST </p><p>VULNERABLE AND HAS TRIED IN "AL-SHAAB" TO SENSITIZE </p><p>ISLAMISTS TO THEIR OVERSIGHT.  WHILE CLEVER ENOUGH TO </p><p>KNOW THAT THE ODDS AGAINST IT ARE GREAT, WE SUSPECT </p><p>ADEL\'S IDEAL SCENARIO WOULD HAVE ISLAMIC AND SECULAR </p><p>ELEMENTS SUCCESSFULLY LINKED AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>WITH EMPTY ISLAMIC RHETORIC MASKING THE ENACTMENT OF A </p><p>HARD-LEFT SOCIAL AGENDA.  IN OLD-LINE COMMUNIST STYLE, </p><p>AN INTELLECTUAL/POLITICAL ELITE OF PEOPLE LIKE ADEL </p><p>WOULD THEN GUIDE THE MASSES ALONG THE PROPER PATH. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>OMAR ABDURRAHMAN:  GODFATHER OF THE FRINGE </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  FOR OVER A DECADE, DR. OMAR ABDURRAHMAN HAS SERVED </p><p>AS THE SPIRITUAL AND, PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY, THE </p><p>OPERATIONAL LEADER OF "AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYYA," A </p><p>RELATIVELY COHESIVE GROUPING ON THE ISLAMIC FRINGE </p><p>UNITED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT FORCE SHOULD BE USED TO </p><p>USHER IN THE ISLAMIC STATE.  RAISED IN ACCORDANCE WITH </p><p>AN OLD ISLAMIC TRADITION THAT BLIND BOYS BE TRAINED TO </p><p>RECITE THE QURAN TO ASSURE THEM A LIVELIHOOD, OMAR </p><p>ABDURRAHMAN HAS BEEN IN AN ALMOST STRICTLY ISLAMIC </p><p>MILIEU ALL HIS LIFE.  IN 1965, HE GRADUATED FROM </p><p>AL-AZHAR, WHERE HE APPARENTLY IMBIBED DEEPLY OF THE </p><p>THOUGHT OF MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD RADICAL SAYYED QUTB, WHO </p><p>NASSER EXECUTED THE SAME YEAR ON CHARGES OF ATTEMPTING </p><p>TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>17.  WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PURSUING HIGHER DEGREES FROM </p><p>AL-AZHAR, ABDURRAHMAN TAUGHT AT AL-AZHAR INSTITUTE IN </p><p>ASSIUT.  HIS RESIDENCE IN THE CITY ROUGHLY CORRESPONDED </p><p>TO SADAT\'S DRIVE TO BOLSTER ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS ON </p><p>EGYPT\'S CAMPUSES TO WEAKEN THE NASSERISTS.  WHETHER OR </p><p>NOT LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITTINGLY USED ABDURRAHMAN, HE </p><p>TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL INSTRUMENTS </p><p>OF THE ISLAMIZATION POLICY, PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO MANY </p><p>OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO HELPED TRANSFORM THE FORMER COPTIC </p><p>BASTION OF ASSIUT INTO AN ACKNOWLEDGED CENTER OF RADICAL </p><p>ISLAM.  THE MOST FAMOUS "FATWA" (RELIGIOUS JUDGMENT) </p><p>RENDERED BY ABDURRAHMAN WAS TO THE ASSASSINS OF </p><p>PRESIDENT SADAT:  I.E., IT IS ISLAMICALLY PROPER TO </p><p>ASSASSINATE AN INFIDEL OR APOSTATE RULER.  THIS FATWA </p><p>EARNED ABDURRAHMAN THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL DEFENDANT IN THE SO-CALLED JIHAD TRIALS </p><p>CONNECTED WITH THE CONSPIRACY TO MURDER SADAT. </p><p>ABDURRAHMAN WAS ACQUITTED IN 1984, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE </p><p>EVIDENCE WAS UNCLEAR ON WHETHER HE HAD DECLARED THAT </p><p>SADAT OR, MORE THEORETICALLY, ANY INFIDEL OR APOSTATE </p><p>RULER COULD BE KILLED. </p><p> </p><p>18.  FOLLOWING HIS ACQUITTAL, ABDURRAHMAN LIVED FOR A </p><p>WHILE IN SAUDI ARABIA, BUT RETURNED IN EARLY 1986 TO THE </p><p>PROVINCE OF AL-FAYYOUM.  SINCE THEN "AL-GAMA\'A </p><p>AL-ISLAMIYYA" (IG), THE GROUP OF WHICH HE IS THE </p><p>SPIRITUAL LEADER, HAS INSPIRED DOZENS OF INCIDENTS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, COPTS, LESS ZEALOUS </p><p>MUSLIMS, AND IN AT LEAST ONE INSTANCE WESTERNERS.  LESS </p><p>CLEAR IS HIS DEGREE OF OPERATIONAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>GROUP\'S ACTIONS.  IN AL-FAYYOUM IN APRIL 1989, IT SEEMS </p><p>CLEAR THAT, DESPITE A SUBSEQUENT ACQUITTAL ON </p><p>EVIDENTIARY GROUNDS, ABDURRAHMAN DIRECTLY URGED HIS </p><p>CONGREGATION TO GET OUT AND BATTLE THE SECURITY FORCES </p><p>IN THE STREETS.  WE HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT THE SPRING 1990 </p><p>BOUT OF SECTARIAN VIOLENCE WAS A STRATEGY CONCOCTED BY </p><p>ABDURRAHMAN.  AT THE SAME TIME, ONE SCHOOL OF OBSERVERS </p><p>OF THE RADICAL FRINGE BELIEVES THAT OTHER LEADERS IN THE </p><p>IG -- TALAAT FUAD QASSEM, RECENTLY RECAPTURED AL-MAHGOUB </p><p>ASSASSIN SAFWAT ABDEL GHANI, OR PERHAPS ABBOUD AL-ZUMOR </p><p>-- DEVELOP PLANS WHICH DR. OMAR MAY BLESS BEFORE OR </p><p>AFTER THE ACT.  WE HAVE NOT SEEN ABDURRAHMAN </p><p>DISASSOCIATE HIMSELF FROM ANY INCIDENT OF SELF-STYLED </p><p>ISLAMIC VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>19.  UNTIL RECENTLY, ABDURRAHMAN HAS BEEN IN </p><p>SELF-IMPOSED EXILE IN THE GREATER NEW YORK AREA.  HE IS </p><p>NOW BELIEVED TO BE IN JEDDAH.  HIS ABSENCE APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE CHANGED HIM AND, LESS CLEARLY, CHANGED THE DYNAMIC </p><p>AT WORK IN THE IG.  SOME HAVE IT THAT ABDURRAHMAN HAS </p><p>GONE FROM CONSIDERING HIMSELF THE SYMBOL OF ISLAMIC </p><p>RESISTANCE IN EGYPT TO FANCYING HIMSELF ONE OF THE </p><p>LEADERS OF THE WORLD ISLAMIC MOVEMENT.  AS SUCH, </p><p>ABDURRAHMAN, WHILE STILL EXCORIATING THE MUBARAK REGIME, </p><p>HAS EXPANDED HIS RADICAL MESSAGE TO DECLARE THAT ALL </p><p>ARAB AND ISLAMIC REGIMES ARE ROTTEN AND MUST BE </p><p>OVERTHROWN BY FORCE.  DURING HIS ABSENCE, HOWEVER, HIS </p><p>GRIP ON THE IG SEEMS TO HAVE LOOSENED PERHAPS BECAUSE </p><p>OTHER FIGURES HAVE SOUGHT TO EXPAND THEIR REPUTATIONS </p><p>AND POWER. </p><p> </p><p>20.  THERE ARE RUMORS THAT ABDURRAHMAN IS COMING HOME. </p><p>IF HE DOES RETURN, THE SAME GOVERNMENT WHICH LET HIM </p><p>LEAVE EGYPT EVEN WHEN STATE SECURITY CHARGES WERE </p><p>OUTSTANDING AGAINST HIM WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO </p><p>DETAIN HIM.  IF HE RETURNS AND IS NOT DETAINED, HE WILL </p><p>STICK TO HIS MOSQUE IN AL-FAYYOUM, RENDER ADVICE TO HIS </p><p>ACOLYTES, VIOLENCE WILL BE DONE IN HIS GROUP\'S NAME, AND </p><p>THE AUTHORITIES WILL WATCH CAREFULLY AND SOMETIMES </p><p>ARREST THE PERPETRATORS.  WHETHER AS SPIRITUAL OR </p><p>OPERATIONAL LEADER, HOWEVER, THIS 53-YEAR-OLD DIABETIC </p><p>WILL REMAIN A MAJOR THORN IN THE SIDE OF THE EGYPTIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT UNTIL ECLIPSED BY ANOTHER RADICAL OR BY POOR </p><p>HEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>ABBOUD AL-ZUMOR:  LEADING FROM HIS CELL? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  THE PLOT TO KILL SADAT AND INCITE INSURRECTION IN </p><p>ASSIUT IN THE WAKE OF THE ASSASSINATION MOST LIKELY OWES </p><p>ITS SUCCESS TO THE PLANNING AND ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS OF </p><p>ABBOUD AL-ZUMOR, A YOUNG MAJOR IN MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE.  IN 1979 OR 1980, ABBOUD AND HIS COUSIN </p><p>TAREQ BECAME ASSOCIATES -- PERHAPS FOLLOWERS -- OF ABD </p><p>AL-SALAAM FARAG, WHO TERMED HIS RADICAL SPLINTER GROUP </p><p>"AL-JIHAD" (AFTER AN EARLIER ALEXANDRIA-BASED </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF THE SAME NAME, HEADED BY ONE ALI IBRAHIM </p><p>SALAMA; WHEN THE ALEX-BASED GROUP WAS SMASHED BY THE </p><p>SECURITY AUTHORITIES, FARAG MOVED TO CAIRO AND STARTED </p><p>HIS GROUP).  EVEN THOUGH HE REPORTEDLY DISAGREED WITH </p><p>THE TIMING OF THE EVENT, ABBOUD USED HIS RECRUITING AND </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS -- WORKING ON THE FAMILIAR </p><p>EGYPTIAN BASIS OF KINSHIP TIES AND PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP </p><p>-- TO DEVELOP THE STRATEGY CULMINATING IN SADAT\'S </p><p>MURDER.  THE NUMER-TWO DEFENDANT IN THE SADAT TRIALS, </p><p>ABBOUD WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT AT HARD LABOR </p><p>IN 1984. </p><p> </p><p>22.  PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, THERE HAVE </p><p>BEEN REPORTS THAT AL-ZUMOR IS PLANNING AND/OR DIRECTING </p><p>ACTS OF ISLAMIC VIOLENCE FROM HIS CELL AT CAIRO\'S </p><p>AL-TORAH PRISON.  ON TWO OCCASIONS, HIS WIFE HAS BEEN </p><p>CAUGHT SMUGGLING RADICAL LITERATURE TO HIM WHICH </p><p>AUTHORITIES BELIEVE WAS FOR HIS CLEARANCE BEFORE </p><p>DISTRIBUTION.  RADICAL ISLAMIC ATTORNEY MONTASSER </p><p>AL-ZAYYAT ALSO REPORTEDLY ACTS AS MESSENGER BETWEEN </p><p>AL-ZUMOR AND HIS ADMIRERS ON THE OUTSIDE.  MOREOVER, IN </p><p>EARLY 1991 A SEARCH OF AL-ZUMOR\'S CELL REVEALED A LOOSE </p><p>PAVING STONE UNDER WHICH HIS JAILERS FOUND HANDWRITTEN </p><p>NOTES WHICH APPARENTLY WERE TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO AN </p><p>ANTI-REGIME PAMPHLET ON THE OUTSIDE.  THERE HAVE BEEN AT </p><p>LEAST TWO HAGIOGRAPHIES OF HIM BASED ON LENGTHY </p><p>INTERVIEWS IN PRISON.  RECENTLY, WE HAVE NOTICED THAT </p><p>AL-ZUMOR, SOMETIMES PURPORTING TO SPEAK FOR THE "JIHAD" </p><p>AND SOMETIMES FOR "AL-GAMA\'A AL-ISLAMIYYA," HAS SENT </p><p>CONDOLENCE MESSAGES AND CONGRATULATIONS TO ISLAMIC </p><p>FIGURES AND SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  THE </p><p>DEGREE TO WHICH AL-ZUMOR ACTUALLY IS SEEKING TO DIRECT </p><p>RADICAL ACTIVITIES FROM PRISON IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS. </p><p>WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT HE IS TRYING TO RAISE HIS PROFILE. </p><p> </p><p>23.  SOME OBSERVERS RELATE THE UPTICK IN AL-ZUMOR\'S </p><p>PUBLICITY TO ABDURRAHMAN\'S ABSENCE.  ONE SCHOOL OF </p><p>THOUGHT HAS IT THAT AL-ZUMOR IS ABDURRAHMAN\'S DISCIPLE, </p><p>AND THAT IN THE SHAYKH\'S ABSENCE ABBOUD IS TRYING TO </p><p>HOLD THE IG TOGETHER.   AN ALTERNATIVE ARGUMENT IS THAT </p><p>THE TWO ARE AT LOGGERHEADS, OR AT LEAST ARE SOMETIMES </p><p>RIVALS.  THE LATTER IS GROUNDED IN THE EVENTS OF THE </p><p>SADAT TRIALS.  THE TWO COOPERATED SMOOTHLY DURING THE </p><p>TIME LEADING UP TO THE KILLING, BUT AT THE TRIAL GAVE </p><p>CONFLICTING TESTIMONY ABOUT THE DETAILS OF ABDURRAHMAN\'S </p><p>"FATWA."  AL-ZUMOR, SO GOES THE STORY, TOLD HIS FELLOW </p><p>CONVICTS THAT THE GREAT DR. OMAR CHICKENED OUT, THAT HE </p><p>STOOD UP FOR ISLAMIC PRINCIPLE ONLY WHEN IT WAS </p><p>CONVENIENT. </p><p> </p><p>24.  DESPITE HIS INCARCERATION, ABBOUD AL-ZUMOR HAS </p><p>SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER ABDURRAHMAN.  SHOULD </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES DEVELOP SUCH THAT THE TWO BECAME REAL </p><p>RIVALS, AL-ZUMOR SHOULD HAVE THE UPPER HAND.  HE IS </p><p>YOUNG (FORTY-TWO) AND ROBUST.  ABDURRAHMAN IS SO </p><p>CORPULENT AND UNHEALTHY THAT FRIENDS AND ENEMIES ALIKE </p><p>AT ONE POINT FEARED HE WOULD DIE IN PRISON.  AL-ZUMOR\'S </p><p>MILITARY BACKGROUND IMBUED HIM WITH STRONG </p><p>ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS AND PERSONAL DISCIPLINE.  WHILE </p><p>ABDURRAHMAN IS THE VOICE OF BLIND, VIOLENT ISLAMIC RAGE, </p><p>AL-ZUMOR IS PATIENT AND METHODICAL, BUT EQUALLY </p><p>DEDICATED TO AN ISLAMIC STATE.  A FREED ABBOUD AL-ZUMOR </p><p>WOULD POSE A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO ABDURRAHMAN\'S STATUS </p><p>AS LEADER OF THE ISLAMIC RADICAL FRINGE. </p><p> </p><p>25.  COMMENT:  WHILE THE ISLAMIC LEADERS IDENTIFIED </p><p>ABOVE JOCKEY FOR POSITION, THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO POSE A </p><p>SERIOUS THREAT TO THE GOVERNMENT.  IF THEY BEGIN TO </p><p>COOPERATE EFFECTIVELY, OR ONE OF THEM SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>HARNESSES PUBLIC DISCONTENT, THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO </p><p>CRACK DOWN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EGAN </p><p></p></div>
