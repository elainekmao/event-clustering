<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000420 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, PINR, PHUM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: POLITICAL ROUNDUP FEBRUARY 28 </p><p> </p><p>Ref: a) Abuja 404 </p><p> b) Abuja 291 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reason: 1.5 </p><p>(b)and(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This periodic joint political report from Abuja and </p><p>Lagos includes: </p><p>--Political Violence Update </p><p>--Potential Party Coalition </p><p>--Will AD Support Obasanjo? </p><p>--ID Card Registration </p><p>--Sharia Amputation in Jigawa </p><p>--Traditional Ruler to be Prosecuted </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Political Violence Update </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) The convention honeymoon, a period of time with </p><p>little to no violence, is over.  An upswing in violence </p><p>throughout the country is now reaching levels we had </p><p>anticipated earlier.  Ref A details much of the last three </p><p>weeks of violence in Kwara State.  In addition, there are </p><p>reports of as many as 45 persons killed and scores of homes </p><p>destroyed in Warri in Delta State in two separate waves of </p><p>violence two weeks apart.  In Benue at least 7 persons were </p><p>killed in ANPP-PDP clashes that started on February 18, </p><p>apparently related to local government elections.  Sporadic </p><p>violence, including the burning of homes and offices, </p><p>continued for 4 days.  Seven people not indigenous to the </p><p>area, an ex-LGA chairman, and two chairmanship candidates </p><p>were arrested. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) In Owerri, Imo State, Theodore Emeka Agwatu, </p><p>Governor Udenwa\'s Principal Secretary, was murdered on </p><p>February 23.  His death follows that of ANPP senatorial </p><p>candidate Ogbonnaya Chijioke Uche, who died February 10 from </p><p>gunshot wounds received three days before.  Motives for </p><p>Agwatu\'s death remain unclear.  Uche\'s death is "being </p><p>investigated" by the police, who privately blame it on an </p><p>internal ANPP feud.  Police deny initial press reports that </p><p>the case was being treated as an armed robbery gone bad, </p><p>although they have not ruled out that possibility. ANPP has </p><p>publicly offered 2 million naira for information on the </p><p>culprit; the police have a similar reward of 100,000 naira. </p><p>Uche defected from the PDP in 2002 and was the immediate </p><p>past Commissioner for Lands, Survey, and Urban Planning in </p><p>Udenwa\'s government.  His wife and brother reportedly were </p><p>"shot at but not hit" the day after Uche was attacked. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) COMMENT: Not all this violence is directly tied to </p><p>elections and electoral politics.  The fighting in Warri has </p><p>more to do with a struggle between two local power brokers. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>POTENTIAL PARTY COALITION </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) There have been at least two other meetings between </p><p>representatives of the majority of new parties since Ref B, </p><p>but with no resolution.  Dr. Alex Ekwueme, the defeated PDP </p><p>candidate and one of the only people most feel would have a </p><p>chance against Obasanjo, has not indicated that he is </p><p>willing to leave the PDP.  Ekwueme continues to fight the </p><p>PDP\'s nomination of Obasanjo in court, even though his </p><p>original suit was thrown out on a technicality.  Chief Gani </p><p>Fawehinmi, candidate for the PRP, has been talking to the </p><p>press about the possibility of his taking on the role of </p><p>coalition candidate, but up to the meeting held on February </p><p>27 there has been no public backing of his candidature by </p><p>the other parties.  Gani\'s best chance to get the nod is </p><p>that, after Alex Ekwueme, he has the highest name </p><p>recognition value countrywide of any possible coalition </p><p>candidates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>WILL AD SUPPORT OBASANJO? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) As noted in Ref B, in the end, the AD will likely </p><p>support Obasanjo.  Numerous "secret" meetings have been held </p><p>between Obasanjo\'s camp and that of various factions within </p><p>the AD.  Some factions within the party are still holding </p><p>out against the alliance and have railed against the party </p><p>leadership for not choosing their own candidate before the </p><p>INEC presidential deadline February 21.  The decision is </p><p>dragging out and any indication from the PDP that they will </p><p>contest against incumbent AD governors could limit the level </p><p>of support the AD party structure is able to offer to </p><p>Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>ID Card Registration </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The National ID Card registration period has started, </p><p>with many of the same problems seen during the voter </p><p>registration process.  After the scheduled two weeks, a </p><p>reported 24 million people have been registered, and the </p><p>program has already been extended for an additional two </p><p>weeks.  The process has been marred by numerous stumbling </p><p>blocks: limitations on the computerized photograph storage </p><p>to 500 pictures at a time, accusations of bribery and the </p><p>selling of cards, and strikes by registration workers over </p><p>lack of pay, to name a few.  In addition, there have been </p><p>problems in some Muslim communities with women not willing </p><p>to remove facial coverings for pictures, and a mistaken </p><p>belief that the traditional henna painting of fingertips </p><p>precludes taking thumbprints.  A suit has been filed over </p><p>the process, which is registering only citizens over the age </p><p>of 18 rather than 10 years and up as required by the </p><p>implementing legislation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) COMMENT: The National ID Card is unlikely to provide </p><p>results any more accurate or reliable than the discredited </p><p>voter registration process a few months ago.  Besides people </p><p>being turned away from registration for not knowing their </p><p>blood type or having fingers roughened from labor in the </p><p>fields or even having an anglicized surname, there seems to </p><p>be some public resistance to the program that will likely </p><p>skew results further.  That said, it has taken more than 20 </p><p>years and hundreds of millions of dollars to begin this </p><p>National I.D. Card program, which seems to be broadly </p><p>accepted throughout Nigeria, even in the North which has </p><p>traditionally viewed this exercise as a way of undercounting </p><p>Northern Nigerians and thereby diminishing their influence </p><p>and resource entitlement in Nigeria. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Sharia Amputation in Jigawa </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) International, but not local, press have reported a </p><p>man in Jigawa State being sentenced by a Sharia court to a </p><p>cross amputation (right hand and left leg) for stealing. </p><p>Haruna Mohammed, a 35-year-old man, was convicted of </p><p>stealing 86,000 naira (USD 630) February 20 and was given 30 </p><p>days to appeal the sentence.  His lawyers appealed the </p><p>following day.  We have not been able to independently </p><p>confirm this sentence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Traditional Ruler to be Prosecuted </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) In a follow-up to an event reported in the Human </p><p>Rights Report for the last two years, the Kaduna State </p><p>Government has filed charges against a traditional ruler and </p><p>6 others for actions during the riots in Kaduna in October </p><p>2001.  Alhaji Ahmadu Mohammed Yakubu, the Sarkin Numana, </p><p>will be tried on a count of "inciting disturbance," while </p><p>the others are being indicted on heavier counts of criminal </p><p>conspiracy, unlawful assembly, and rioting. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
