Fearful residents want to know the fate of their </p><p>loved ones, but police have admitted to finding only one </p><p>body.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On December 10 police in Nkayi District (in </p><p>Matabeleland North Province) reportedly retrieved five </p><p>skeletons from an abandoned well near the town of Lukona. </p><p>The BBC, which also reported the story, and the Daily News </p><p>reported the site was a defunct "dip tank" (a tank usually </p><p>about six feet deep for dipping cattle in a pesticide bath). </p><p>But according to the government-owned weekly Bulawayo Sunday </p><p>News, and Nkayi MDC MP Abednico Bhebhe who is in touch with </p><p>local residents and a police officer in Nkayi, the site was </p><p>an abandoned well about 100 feet deep. </p><p> </p><p>Body Parts </p><p>---------- </p><p>3. (SBU) (Note: In April 2002, the independent weekly </p><p>Financial Gazette reported that residents of Lenkubini, </p><p>another village in Nkayi District, found a hand floating in a </p><p>dip tank there.  According to Shari Eppl of Amani Trust, a </p><p>local human rights NGO, and Bhebhe, residents reported that </p><p>police guarded the site overnight while two to three </p><p>skeletons were removed.  Later the official police report </p><p>said no bodies were found.  News reporters may be confusing </p><p>the two sites.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Missing Bodies </p><p>-------------- </p><p>4. (C) The Lukona investigation and finding arose when </p><p>villagers noticed that a ZANU-PF youth militia member, known </p><p>only as Mazolo, was missing from the area.  They questioned </p><p>and beat other ZANU-PF youths in the area, who eventually </p><p>confessed to killing their colleague and dumping his body in </p><p>the abandoned well.  The villagers informed Nkayi police, who </p><p>arrested ZANU-PF youth militia member Mandla Ncube. </p><p>According to Bhebhe, who has a contact inside the Nkayi </p><p>police department, Ncube confessed the killing to police and </p><p>revealed that war veterans had killed and dumped bodies of </p><p>MDC members in the well during the March 2002 election </p><p>period.  According to the government-owned Bulawayo Sunday </p><p>News the \'one\' skeleton found belongs to Freedom </p><p>Ncube--killed by cattle thieves for threatening to reveal </p><p>them. </p><p> </p><p>The Killer Next Door </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>5. (C) The Daily News reported that a local war veteran </p><p>commonly known as Khiwa accompanied police to the well at </p><p>Lukona on December 10.  According to Bhebhe, Mandla Ncube </p><p>fingered Khiwa as responsible for the deaths of those in the </p><p>well.  According to Bhebhe, two other MDC members abducted on </p><p>February 6, 2002 and tortured for a month at an underground </p><p>military-style bunker in Nguana (Nkayi District), Newman </p><p>Bhebhe and Van Dube, had subsequently reported in signed </p><p>affidavits to police that Khiwa (whose real name is Esa </p><p>Ngwenya) was their lead captor.  The two were abducted along </p><p>with a third MDC member, Tembendi Ndebele, who died during </p><p>the episode at the bunker.  Amani Trust interviewed Van Dube </p><p>and documented the medical evidence of his torture.  The </p><p>three had been sent to Mateme (Nkayi district) to set up an </p><p>MDC rally ahead of the presidential contest.  According to </p><p>Bhebhe, Khiwa is affiliated with the CIO, and investigated </p><p>alleged dissidents for the GOZ during the Matabeleland </p><p>Massacres in the 1980s. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Bhebhe reported that torture sites were also set up </p><p>in bush areas near Lukona, Bona and Isifisosikazulu (Nkayi </p><p>District) in the run-up to the March 2002 presidential </p><p>challenge. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>7. (C) Nkayi district witnessed some of the worst violence in </p><p>the country leading up to the March 2002 elections; dozens of </p><p>people are still missing.  Residents were visibly afraid to </p><p>talk to Poloff during a visit there in September 2002, but </p><p>they are also reportedly eager to know if any of the bodies </p><p>found belong to people they know.  Given that police are </p><p>admitting to finding only one body at Lukona, it seems </p><p>unlikely that the identities of the rest of the victims will </p><p>ever be revealed.  It is also disturbing that Khiwa, who </p><p>appears to have been implicated for torturing and killing MDC </p><p>members in other cases, accompanied police to the Lukona </p><p>well, and is able to move about freely.  Police seem to be </p><p>caught between grieving and fearful fellow residents who want </p><p>answers, and ZANU-PF authorities who would rather hide the </p><p>truth.  Ever more concerned with their own safety and putting </p><p>food on the table, it appears unlikely that rural Nkayi </p><p>residents would stand up to ZANU-PF authorities and insist on </p><p>a thorough investigation.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
