AFTER MUCH DITHERING BY THE 15- </p><p>NATION EU IN THE FAINT HOPE THAT MUGABE COULD SEE COMMON </p><p>SENSE, THE WORLD\'S LARGEST TRADING BLOC IS FINALLY </p><p>MAKING THE POINT THAT THE TIME FOR POLITICAL THEATRICS </p><p>AND SHEER MADNESS BY ZIMBABWE\'S LEADERS IS OVER. . . </p><p> </p><p>AS THE EU, THE COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN MINISTERS WHO ARE </p><p>GATHERING IN ZIMBABWE THIS WEEK MUST FORCEFULLY TELL </p><p>MUGABE THAT THE TIME FOR HIS DANGEROUS GAMES WITH THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND ZIMBABWEANS IS UP. </p><p> </p><p>. . .THUS THE VISITING COMMONWEALTH TEAM AND THE ENTIRE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BEAR THE GRAVEST MORAL AND LEGAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE THESE ACTS OF </p><p>MADNESS STOPPED WITHOUT DELAY BUT THAT ZIMBABWEANS DO </p><p>HAVE MINIMUM CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH A FREE AND FAIR </p><p>BALLOT CAN BE STAGED.

THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DID THE RIGHT THING IN REJECTING THE </p><p>ULTIMATUM, AND FORTHRIGHTLY TELLING THE EU THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p>IS A SOVEREIGN STATE. </p><p> </p><p>...THE EU SHOULD KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT IN RHODESIA.

WE REFER HERE TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE EU </p><p>MEMBERS WHO HAVE GIVEN ZIMBABWE AN ULTIMATUM ON THE </p><p>ISSUE OF ELECTION MONITORS.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE EU </p><p>HAS ALREADY CONCLUDED THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE RIGGED. </p><p>IT LEAVES US MORE THAN CONVINCED THAT THE EU HAS ALREADY </p><p>COME UP WITH ITS OWN \'PRESIDENT\' FOR THE COUNTRY AND </p><p>THAT IT WANTS TO SEND ITS AGENTS TO MANIPULATE THE </p><p>ELECTIONS TO SUIT ITS AGENDA... </p><p> </p><p>THE SAD THING IS THAT THE PERCEPTION PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTIONS WILL BE RIGGED IS A CREATION OF THE WESTERN </p><p>MEDIA AND THEIR AGENTS IN HARARE.
