<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001665 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EFIN, ETTC, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: FONMIN MUASHER AGAIN RAISES JORDANIAN </p><p>CONCERN ON O-F-F SUSPENSION; NEED FOR QUICK UNSC ACTION TO </p><p>AUTHORIZE COTECNA OPERATIONS OUTSIDE IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) During a March 19 meeting with Ambassador on a number </p><p>of subjects, FonMin Muasher raised the GOJ\'s concern with the </p><p>current suspension of the Oil For Food (OFF) program. </p><p>Muasher told the Ambassador that Jordan\'s mission in New York </p><p>has been told that shipments currently en route to Iraq must </p><p>be sent back because there is no Cotecna staff left in Iraq </p><p>to verify the arrival of the goods.  Jordan has long feared </p><p>that such a scenario would have a serious negative impact on </p><p>Jordanian banks, which have financed O-F-F exports to Iraq. </p><p>(Muasher\'s assistant Ali al-Ayed subsequently confirmed to </p><p>Econ/C that Jordan\'s UN Mission has raised Jordan\'s concerns </p><p>directly with the UN\'s Office of the Iraq Program.) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Muasher noted that its UN Mission understands that the </p><p>U.K. intends to put forward a resolution soon after </p><p>hostilities begin to revise procedures for the O-F-F program. </p><p> These would hopefully allow Cotecna to carry out its </p><p>functions in the countries neighboring Iraq.  "We need that </p><p>done quickly," Muasher stressed, "its extremely important to </p><p>us." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) We agree completely with Muasher that whatever UNSC </p><p>action is needed to resume the O-F-F program be done as </p><p>quickly as possible -- both to ensure the health of Jordan\'s </p><p>banking system, and more broadly to facilitate delivery of </p><p>humanitarian supplies to Iraq\'s civilian populations. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
