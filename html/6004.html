End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Little Improvement in Food Situation </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  A monthly monitoring report issued by the National NGO </p><p>Food Security Network (FOSENET) suggests little improvement </p><p>in the food security situation across the country due to </p><p>absolute scarcity of food--this in spite of increased levels </p><p>of WFP and other international food aid.  The report also </p><p>suggests increasing levels of politicization of Grain </p><p>Marketing Board (GMB) and commercial food and profiteering in </p><p>food distribution and access.  Absolute scarcity surpassed </p><p>cost and selective bias in access as major impediments to </p><p>food security.  FOSENET is a network of 24 Zimbabwean NGOs, </p><p>organized in March 2002 to monitor food needs, availability, </p><p>and access through NGOs based within districts, and through </p><p>community based monitors. </p><p> </p><p>3.  This was FOSENET,s fifth report.  It is based upon 133 </p><p>reports from 43 of Zimbabwe\'s 57 districts covering the </p><p>period December 2002 through January 2003.  The report covers </p><p>fewer districts than the November version, making comparisons </p><p>difficult.  NGO and community monitoring were combined in </p><p>this round, which led to more than one report being received </p><p>from more than 60 percent of districts. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Overall conclusions from the report are as follows: </p><p> </p><p>--Food security worsened in 27 districts, or 63 percent of </p><p>responding districts, in December and January.  In November, </p><p>75 percent of reporting districts reported increased food </p><p>insecurity when compared to October levels.  Only Nyanga in </p><p>Manicaland reported increased supplies, while in nearby </p><p>Mutare rural people were reported to be moving away from </p><p>their homes because of hunger. </p><p> </p><p>--Vulnerability dropped slightly from November with the share </p><p>of districts reporting everyone in need of food decreasing </p><p>from 51 percent in November to 47 percent in December/January. </p><p> </p><p>--Close to half of all districts (49 percent) reported </p><p>falling, erratic GMB supplies.  In November, two-thirds of </p><p>respondents reported falling GMB supplies.  In spite of this </p><p>seeming improvement in GMB supplies, the average volume of </p><p>deliveries per ward declined to 1.8 tons from 3.4 tons in </p><p>November and 9.3 tons in October.  Matabeleland North and </p><p>South and Mashonaland West have consistently reported one or </p><p>more districts with no GMB deliveries over the last six </p><p>months.  Hurungwe in Mashonaland West and Lupane in </p><p>Matabeleland North have reported wards that have not received </p><p>GMB deliveries since October and July, respectively.  Buhera </p><p>in Manicaland and Tsholotsho in Matabeleland North, with </p><p>several months of no delivery in November, did not report </p><p>this round. </p><p> </p><p>--Political barriers and procedural bias continued to be </p><p>obstacles to accessing GMB grain.  These barriers increased </p><p>from 38 percent of districts in November to 62 percent in </p><p>December/January.  The major barrier to food access was the </p><p>requirement to produce a ZANU-PF party card.  To get a letter </p><p>from the councilor or headman to certify residence, potential </p><p>beneficiaries had to demonstrate ruling party membership or </p><p>participation in ruling party activities. </p><p> </p><p>--The cost of GMB sales was a barrier to access in 10 percent </p><p>of districts, less than the 22 percent in November and 38 </p><p>percent in October.  The upper price range for a 10-kg bag of </p><p>corn meal was Z$260, 124 percent above the controlled price. </p><p> </p><p>--Reduced supply and political barriers were major reported </p><p>obstacles to commercially supplied food.  Political </p><p>interference in commercial sales, in particular the youth </p><p>militia and police controlling food queues or claiming </p><p>preferential access, increased since the November report. </p><p>This is most likely due to the increased scarcity of food. </p><p> </p><p>--The upper price range for a 10-kg bag of corn meal on the </p><p>informal market was Z$3000 in December/January, almost 25 </p><p>times the controlled price.  The price differential between </p><p>the official GMB price for a 10-kg bag of corn meal and the </p><p>informal market price has widened from Z$490 in July 2002 to </p><p>Z$2800 in January.  Even though the value of the Zimbabwe </p><p>dollar has fallen over the last seven months, this represents </p><p>a significant cost escalation for poor people whose incomes </p><p>have not kept pace with inflation. </p><p> </p><p>--The report indicated mixed results in terms of relief </p><p>supplies.  Six district sites reported an increase in relief </p><p>supplies, ten reported no change in supply, two (Zvimba and </p><p>Chivi) reported a fall, and at least eight (Hwedza, Seke, </p><p>Murewa, Goromonzi, Chikomba, Chinhoyi, Hurungwe, and Makonde) </p><p>reported no supplies at all.  The primary barriers to relief </p><p>aid were procedural and related to households not qualifying </p><p>for inclusion on beneficiary lists.  At least three districts </p><p>reported incidents of political bias or interference: Gutu in </p><p>Masvingo, Gweru in Midlands, and Makoni in Manicaland. </p><p> </p><p>Relief Food on Pace </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  World Food Program more than doubled its deliveries in </p><p>January from December and is poised to distribute close to </p><p>its target of 53,562 tons in February.  This would see an </p><p>increase in beneficiaries from 2.2 million in December to 4.3 </p><p>in February.  WFP anticipates all 48 WFP-designated districts </p><p>will receive food assistance during February so the next </p><p>FOSENET report should indicate either no change or an </p><p>increase in relief food aid.  The remaining nine rural </p><p>districts will be covered through other pipelines, including </p><p>the USG\'s C-SAFE program that covers seven districts. </p><p> </p><p>Transportation Woes Besiege Government Deliveries </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>6.  Deliveries of GMB supplies of corn meal are unlikely to </p><p>improve in the near term because of transportation </p><p>bottlenecks.  The state-sponsored newspaper, The Herald, </p><p>reported that the GMB was having problems bringing in </p><p>shipments from seaports, Beira and Maputo in Mozambique and </p><p>East London in South Africa.  The GMB has blamed neighboring </p><p>country rail networks, port facilities, the port operators </p><p>demanding foreign currency for the transportation </p><p>bottlenecks, and inadequacy and unreliability of the National </p><p>Railways of Zimbabwe.  More recently, the GOZ has indicated </p><p>its inability to compete with foreign exchange prices paid by </p><p>WFP and other international importers for limited available </p><p>transport services. </p><p> </p><p>7.  NGOs continue to insist that the current fuel shortage </p><p>has not and will not have an effect on food distributions. </p><p>This is counterintuitive, particularly since most </p><p>international donors contract independent truckers, who do </p><p>not have consistent access to fuel, to transport food. Of </p><p>greater concern to the NGOs is the shortage of spare parts. </p><p> </p><p>Political Bias in Food Access </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Since the last FOSENET report in November, both the </p><p>independent and state-owned press have reported more </p><p>incidents of political party members denying GMB food to </p><p>select groups of people and of people profiteering. </p><p> </p><p>--In Gweru, the Daily News reported the arrest and detention </p><p>of a city councilor after he failed to account for the </p><p>presence of 30 bags of corn meal in his home.  (NOTE: </p><p>Councilors nationwide have been given full responsibility to </p><p>collect meal from millers for distribution. END NOTE.) </p><p>--In Mutare, the Daily News reported an investigation of the </p><p>deputy mayor and a councilor (both ZANU-PF) for allegedly </p><p>distributing corn meal in a non-transparent way and along </p><p>political lines.  The Mutare mayor, who is a relatively </p><p>independent ZANU-PF figure, is leading the investigation. </p><p> </p><p>--In Mashava, the Daily News reported that ZANU-PF supporters </p><p>blocked food aid from going into town because they believe </p><p>the councilor for the district, who is a member of MDC, is </p><p>excluding ZANU-PF supporters. </p><p>--In Masvingo, a former ZANU-PF MP for Harare South was </p><p>arrested for having five metric tons of corn believed to have </p><p>come from the GMB under dubious circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>--In Gutu, The Herald reported Deputy Minister of Youth </p><p>Development, Gender, and Employment creation, Shuvai Mahofa </p><p>was fined for overcharging (by Z$2800) on corn in one of her </p><p>shops.  Police are also investigating 10 metric tons of corn </p><p>found at a mill she owns. Earlier in the month, the manager </p><p>of the Gutu GMB was charged with corruptly selling corn to </p><p>one of Mahofa,s mills. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>8.  At first glance, the smaller proportion of districts </p><p>reporting a deteriorating level of food security and no </p><p>deliveries of GMB food might lead one to believe that the </p><p>situation had improved significantly since November. </p><p>However, a meaningful comparison between this report and the </p><p>last one is difficult since this one queried ten fewer </p><p>districts than the previous one.  These ten districts could </p><p>change the overall conclusion of the report.  The seemingly </p><p>improved GMB coverage is also misleading in that it does not </p><p>factor in the decreased volume and frequency of deliveries. </p><p>Nonetheless, the food security situation should improve over </p><p>the next few months mainly because of increased food relief </p><p>supplies from international donors.  Unfortunately, this will </p><p>only benefit those sufficiently destitute to make it onto the </p><p>beneficiary rolls.  Logistical constraints and political bias </p><p>in distribution will limit food access of the remaining </p><p>people.  Too, the increased opportunities for profiteering on </p><p>the parallel market will continue to reduce available GMB </p><p>supplies.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
