<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 002586 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR IO/T, WHA/PPC, AND WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AORC, KSCA, TBIO, TPHY, HO, UNGA </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAS UNDECIDED ON CLONING CONVENTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 164566 </p><p>     B. STATE 160115 </p><p> </p><p>PolCouns demarched MFA Director General of Foreign Policy </p><p>Mario Fortin in August on the UN Convention to Ban Human </p><p>Cloning (ref B).  Fortin told PolCouns that the GOH also </p><p>believed that there should be a total ban on cloning.  PolOff </p><p>delivered Spanish talking points (ref A) September 5 to </p><p>Fortin who told PolOff September 11 that while cloning was a </p><p>complicated issue, he believed that the UN would arrive at an </p><p>accord.  He also said that initially the GOH had supported </p><p>the German and French approach that would ban only </p><p>reproductive cloning, a statement that contradicted his </p><p>earlier remarks.  Fortin told PolOff that the MFA was </p><p>studying the U.S. position and that he would leave </p><p>instructions to the Honduran Mission to the UN before he left </p><p>UNGA September 20. </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
