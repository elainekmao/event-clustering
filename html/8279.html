<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 003463 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKS FIRM IN THEIR SUPPORT FOR "OPTION TWO" FOR </p><p>NATO COMMAND RESTRUCTURING </p><p> </p><p>REF: ATHENS 01723 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Political-Military Counselor Stuart </p><p>Brown.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Polmiloff met with Fatih Ceylan, Head of the MFA NATO </p><p>and Euro-Atlantic Defense and Security Affairs Department, on </p><p>May 22 on the subject of NATO command restructuring. Ceylan </p><p>said that Turkey would be ready to approve the restructuring </p><p>plan at the NATO Ministerial in June if "Option Two" is the </p><p>plan being considered. "Option Two" allots an air component </p><p>command to Turkey (Izmir). Ceylan noted that the GOT has </p><p>always been opposed to a concentration of headquarters in any </p><p>one country, particularly now that the primary security </p><p>threats are asymmetrical in nature. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ceylan said the GOT understood that there was a </p><p>"gentlemen,s agreement" among Spain, Italy, Greece and </p><p>Turkey at the US-hosted Senior Officials Group (SOG) to </p><p>support "Option Two." However, Spain and Greece subsequently </p><p>emerged with demands for additional NATO facilities. Spain </p><p>insists on hosting a Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) in </p><p>addition to a land headquarters, and Greece wants another </p><p>entity, preferably NAVSOUTH, in addition to a CAOC. Ceylan </p><p>stressed that the MFA will not accept any plan that deviates </p><p>from "Option Two." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Embassy Ankara understands that the details of "Option </p><p>Two" are as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>      - SHAPE in Mons, BE; </p><p>- Joint Force Commands in Brunssum, NL and Naples, IT; Third </p><p>Joint HQ in Lisbon, PO; </p><p>      - Land Component Commands in Heidelberg, GE and Madrid, </p><p>SP; </p><p>      - Air Component Commands in Ramstein, GE and Izmir, TU; </p><p>- Maritime Component Commands in Northwood, UK and Naples, IT; </p><p>- CAOCs in Finderup, DA and Larissa, GR with co-located </p><p>CAOCs/Deployable CAOCs in Uedem, GE and Poggio Renatico, </p><p>  IT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
