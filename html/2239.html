<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 BOGOTA 010584 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/27/11 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, PGOV, CO </p><p>SUBJ: FARC RESISTS RE-STARTING TALKS/SLAMS U.N. </p><p> </p><p>1.  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON; REASONS </p><p>1.5 B,D. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) SUMMARY: DESPITE A SERIES OF ATTEMPTS SINCE MID- </p><p>NOVEMBER BY UNSYG OUTGOING REPRESENTATIVE JAN EGELAND, </p><p>GOC PEACE COMMISSIONER CAMILO GOMEZ, AND AMBASSADORS FROM </p><p>THE "GROUP OF FACILITATORS" COUNTRIES TO RE-START PEACE </p><p>TALKS WITH THE FARC, THE LATTER REMAIN INTRANSIGENT IN </p><p>THEIR DEMANDS.  THE FARC LEADERSHIP HAS STATED REPEATEDLY </p><p>THAT THEY WILL NOT NEGOTIATE UNTIL THE GOC RELAXES ITS </p><p>CONTROLS OVER THE "DESPEJE," ESPECIALLY THE ENTRY OF </p><p>THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS SYMPATHETIC TO THE FARC AND </p><p>COLOMBIAN MILITARY OVERFLIGHTS.  FARC SUPREME COMMANDER </p><p>MARULANDA HAS INVITED COLOMBIAN POLITICAL, JUDICIAL AND </p><p>BUSINESS LEADERS TO A JANUARY 15, 2001 MEETING IN THE </p><p>"DESPEJE" TO CLARIFY WHAT THE COLOMBIAN ESTABLISHMENT IS </p><p>WILLING TO NEGOTIATE.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ON NOVEMBER 26, FARC SUPREME COMMANDER MANUEL </p><p>MARULANDA SENT A LETTER THROUGH GOC PEACE COMMISSIONER </p><p>CAMILO GOMEZ TO PRESIDENT PASTRANA, IN WHICH HE ARGUES </p><p>THAT THE GOC HAS TAKEN ALL CONCRETE "NEGOTIABLES" OFF THE </p><p>TABLE, INCLUDING PLAN COLOMBIA, AERIAL ERADICATION OF </p><p>ILLICIT CROPS, THE ELECTORAL CALENDAR, PRISONER </p><p>EXCHANGES, AND INTERNATIONAL TREATIES SUBSCRIBED BY </p><p>COLOMBIA ON ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, JUDICIAL ISSUES, AND </p><p>EXTRADITION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) MARULANDA CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO </p><p>NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOC, AND CALLS FOR A MEETING ON </p><p>JANUARY 15, 2002 IN THE FARC "DEMILITARIZED ZONE" </p><p>("DESPEJE") WITH THE SENATE AND HOUSE SPEAKERS, THE </p><p>SUPREME AND CONSTITUTIONAL COURT PRESIDENTS, THE CHAMBERS </p><p>OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY PRESIDENTS, AND THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH HIERARCHY.  HE STATED HE EXPECTS THIS GROUP TO </p><p>EXPLAIN TO HIM "EXACTLY WHAT IS NEGOTIABLE." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) MARULANDA\'S LETTER FOLLOWS A SERIES OF LARGELY </p><p>UNSUCCESSFUL MEETINGS IN THE "DESPEJE" WITH UNSYG </p><p>COLOMBIA REPRESENTATIVE JAN EGELAND, GOC PEACE </p><p>COMMISSIONER CAMILO GOMEZ, AND EU AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY AMBASSADORS, RESPECTIVELY.  ON NOVEMBER 16, THE </p><p>FARC REFUSED JAN EGELAND\'S REQUEST TO MEET IN THE </p><p>DESPEJE.  INSTEAD, FARC SPOKESMAN RAUL REYES SENT EGELAND </p><p>A LETTER STATING THAT EGELAND WOULD NOT BE GIVEN AN </p><p>AUDIENCE UNTIL THE GOC LIFTED AN ORDER PROHIBITING FREE </p><p>ENTRY OF THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS INTO THE DESPEJE AS WELL </p><p>AS OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THE ZONE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) SEVERAL DAYS LATER, THE FARC CHANGED ITS MIND AND </p><p>MET ON NOVEMBER 22 WITH EGELAND AND NEWLY-DESIGNATED </p><p>UNSYG COLOMBIA REPRESENTATIVE JAMES LEMOYNE IN THE </p><p>"DESPEJE."  ALTHOUGH EGELAND TOLD LOCAL PRESS THAT BOTH </p><p>SIDES STILL HAVE THE WILL TO MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD, </p><p>EMBASSY CONTACTS SAID THAT THE MEETING WAS DIFFICULT AT </p><p>BEST, AND THAT FARC INTERLOCUTORS RAUL REYES AND JOAQUIN </p><p>GOMEZ TOLD EGELAND AND LEMOYNE IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT </p><p>TALKS COULD NOT PROCEED SO LONG AS THE GOC MAINTAINS ITS </p><p>NEW, TIGHTER CONTROLS OVER THE "DESPEJE."  ON NOVEMBER </p><p>23, CAMILO GOMEZ MET WITH REYES AND GOMEZ, AND WAS </p><p>REPORTEDLY GIVEN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME MESSAGE -- RELAX </p><p>CONTROL OVER THE ZONE AND THEN WE\'LL SEE. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ON NOVEMBER 25, A DELEGATION OF "GROUP OF </p><p>FACILITATORS" AMBASSADORS MET WITH REYES AND GOMEZ IN THE </p><p>"DESPEJE."  ON NOVEMBER 26, A FOREIGN DIPLOMAT WHO WAS </p><p>PRESENT AT THE MEETING TOLD POL/ECONCOUNS THAT THE </p><p>ATMOSPHERICS WERE "VERY FORMAL," THAT REYES AND GOMEZ </p><p>HAMMERED AT THE GOC SECURITY CONTROLS OVER THE DESPEJE, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THE OVERFLIGHTS, AND THAT THEY WERE FIRM ON </p><p>THEIR POSITION THAT CONTROLS HAVE TO BE RELAXED. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) THE DIPLOMAT SAID THE AMBASSADORS, LED BY FRENCH </p><p>AMBASSADOR PARFAIT (FRANCE IS NOW CHAIR OF THE "GROUP OF </p><p>FACILITATORS," UNDER A ROTATING CHAIR SYSTEM), TOLD THE </p><p>FARC THAT THE EU WILL MEET IN DECEMBER TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>ISSUE OF FARC VISAS AND EXPLAINED THAT SOME MEMBERS WERE </p><p>ADVOCATING A HARD LINE BASED ON THE FARC KIDNAPPINGS OF </p><p>FOREIGNERS.  ASKED WHETHER THE GROUP HAD GIVEN THE FARC </p><p>AN "ULTIMATUM" CALLING FOR THE FARC TO CHANGE ITS TACTICS </p><p>OR LOSE THE VISAS, THE DIPLOMATS ANSWERED THAT NEITHER AN </p><p>"ULTIMATUM," NOR A HARD MESSAGE HAD BEEN DELIVERED BY THE </p><p>EU. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE DIPLOMAT SAID THAT THE GROUP ASKED THE FARC </p><p>TO MAKE SOME TYPE OF "GESTURE" THAT WOULD HELP ADVANCE </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS.  IN THE END, THE FARC MADE NO PROMISES </p><p>TO EITHER MAKE A "GESTURE" OR TO AGREE TO A BROADER </p><p>MEETING WITH THE GOC NEGOTIATING TEAM AND FACILITATORS. </p><p>INSTEAD, THE FARC COMPLAINED THAT SUCH A MEETING WAS </p><p>UNLIKELY UNTIL/UNLESS THE GOC LIFTS SOME OF ITS SECURITY </p><p>CONTROLS.  THE DIPLOMAT SAID THAT, INSTEAD, REYES AND </p><p>GOMEZ USED THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAIL AGAINST THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS, WHICH THEY CHARACTERIZED AS AN UNREPRESENTATIVE </p><p>BODY BECAUSE "SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ARE NOT FAIRLY </p><p>REPRESENTED IN IT." </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) COMMENT: THE FARC LEADERSHIP CONTINUES TO PLAY </p><p>BRINKMANSHIP WITH THE PEACE PROCESS.  THEY HAVE NOT </p><p>BUDGED AT ALL IN THEIR DEMAND THAT THE GOC RELAX ITS </p><p>CONTROLS OVER THE "DESPEJE," BEFORE TALKS CAN RESUME. </p><p>THE FARC LIKELY FEELS VULNERABLE TO THE COLOMBIAN </p><p>SECURITY FORCES\' ADDED SURVEILLANCE OF THE ZONE, WHICH </p><p>THEY BELIEVE ADVERSELY IMPACTS THEIR ABILITY TO USE THE </p><p>ZONE AS A REPOSITORY FOR KIDNAP VICTIMS AND STOLEN CATTLE </p><p>AND VEHICLES; A REST AND RECUPERATION AND TRAINING AREA </p><p>FOR COMBATANTS, AND A COCA GROWING ZONE.  MARULANDA\'S </p><p>LATEST OFFER TO DELAY TALKS UNTIL NEXT JANUARY 15 IS </p><p>PROBABLY INTENDED TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE GOC AND THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY (ESPECIALLY THE EUROPEANS) TO </p><p>EASE UP ON CONTROLS OVER THE "DESPEJE" AND ON THE EU\'S </p><p>POSSIBLE REVOCATION OF VISAS TO LEVERAGE THE FARC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PATTERSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
