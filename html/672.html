<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DUSHANBE 02006 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS EUR/ISCA; </p><p>USMISSION USVIENNA FOR USDEL CSCE; </p><p>MOSCOW FOR POL (PLEASE PASS AMBASSADOR ESCUDERO) </p><p>WARSAW FOR JACK ZETKULIK </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: GOV, PREL, PINR, PHUM, TI, RS </p><p>SUBJECT: FORMER PRIME MINISTER ABDULLAJANOV NOMINATED FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT IN WHAT IS SHAPING UP AS A REAL HORSERACE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) MOSCOW 22287, B) DUSHANBE 2003, </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  THE LENINABAD REGION HAS OVERWHELMINGLY NOMINATED </p><p>FORMER PRIME MINISTER ABDULLAJANOV FOR PRESIDENT. HE JOINS </p><p>PARLIAMENT CHAIRMAN RAHMONOV IN THE RACE WHICH WILL BE DECIDED IN </p><p>THE SEPTEMBER 25 ELECTION.  ABDULLAJANOV, WHO SERVED BOTH THE </p><p>OPPOSITION AND THE RAHMONOV GOVERNMENTS AS PRIME MINISTER, </p><p>EMERGES AS A VERY STRONG CANDIDATE, POSSIBLY THE INITIAL </p><p>FAVORITE.  OPPOSITIONISTS\' PUBLIC CONCERNS/THREATS REGARDING THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES OF A ONE-MAN RACE APPEAR MOLLIFIED.  WE SEE </p><p>ABDULAJANOV LIKELY TO CAPITALIZE ON BROAD DISSATISFACTION WITH </p><p>THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS BEEN UNABLE TO STOP THE SLIDE </p><p>INTO ECONOMIC CHAOS AND IS WIDELY RESENTED FOR ITS CORRUPTION AND </p><p>HEAVY HANDEDNESS. PUBLIC CHARGES OF CORRUPTION AGAINST </p><p>ABDULAJANOV WILL UNDERMINE HIS CAMPAIGN AS WELL, HOWEVER.  THIS </p><p>IS A HIGH STAKES RACE IN WHICH BOTH SIDES ARE LIKELY TO PULL OUT </p><p>ALL STOPS.  INTERNATIONAL MONITORING COULD BE DECISIVE IN </p><p>DETERMINING WHETHER TAJIKISTAN\'S VOTERS HAVE A CHANCE TO CAST </p><p>THEIR VOTES IN A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE LENINABAD REGIONAL ASSEMBLY MEETING IN SPECIAL SESSION </p><p>AUGUST 6 NOMINATED ABDULMALIK ABDULAJANOV, FORMER PRIME MINISTER </p><p>AND CURRENTLY TAJIKISTAN\'S AMBASSADOR IN MOSCOW, AS THE REGION\'S </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.  HE JOINS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>(AND CURRENTLY CHIEF OF STATE) EMOMALI RAHMONOV IN THE RACE FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT TO BE DECIDED IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS SEPTEMBER 25 (REFS </p><p>A AND B). </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE KEENLY WATCHED LENINABAD SESSION PRODUCED THREE </p><p>CANDIDATES FOR THE REGIONAL NOMINATION: ABDULAJANOV, RAHMONOV AND </p><p>A PROMINENT UZBEK BUSINESSMAN FROM KANIBODAM DISTRICT (YUSUFJON </p><p>AHMADOV). AHMADOV IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW HIS NAME FROM </p><p>CONSIDERATION SETTING UP A HEAD-TO-HEAD CONFRONTATION BETWEEN </p><p>RAHMONOV AND ABDULLAJANOV.  IN A SECRET BALLOT, ABDULAJANOV WAS </p><p>THE EASY WINNER COLLECTING 137 VOTES TO RAHMONOV\'S 33. GOTI </p><p>CENTRAL MEDIA REPORTED THE LENINABAD ASSEMBLY RESULT ONE DAY </p><p>AFTER THE ACTION BUT OMITED THE FACT THAT THERE HAD BEEN A HEAD </p><p>TO HEAD CONTEST BETWEEN ABDULLAJANOV AND RAHMONOV AND THAT THE </p><p>ABDULLAJANOV HAD BEEN AS DECISIVE AS IT WAS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE LENINABAD ACTION CAME IN THE WAKE OF THE NOMINATION OF </p><p>RAHMONOV BY THE KHATLON REGIONAL ASSEMBLY AND BY THE NATIONAL </p><p>YOUTH FEDERATION (REF B).  BOTH BODIES HAD SENT FORMAL MESSAGES </p><p>TO THE LENINABAD REGIONAL SESSION URGING THAT IT JOIN IN A </p><p>CONSENSUS ENDORSEMENT OF RAHMONOV. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WHILE THERE HAS BEEN NO OPPOSITION REACTION TO ABDULAJANOV\'S </p><p>NOMINATION, STATEMENTS ON THE EVE OF THE LENINABAD NOMINATION HAD </p><p>INCLUDED WARNINGS ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF A ONE-MAN RACE FOR </p><p>PRESIDENT.  LEADER OF TAJIKISTAN\'S REFUGEE ORGANIZATION IN MOSCOW </p><p>AND OPPOSITIONIST HABIB SANGINOV WAS QUOTED ON RADIO KHORASAN </p><p>(IRAN) AS HAVING STATED THAT IF RAHMONOV EMERGED AS THE ONLY </p><p>CANDIDATE, THE SEPTEMBER 25 VOTE COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE A </p><p>REAL ELECTION.  OPPOSITION COMMANDER REDZUAN IN THE SAME </p><p>BROADCAST WAS QUOTED AS STATING THAT IF RAHMONOV WERE THE ONLY </p><p>NOMINEE THEN THE OPPOSITION WOULD CAST ITS VOTE WITH ROCKETS. </p><p>THERE WILL BE MUCH ATTENTION PAID TO THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL </p><p>OPPOSITION REACTION TO THE NOMINATION OF ABDULAJANOV, WHO WAS </p><p>PRIME MINISTER IN THE BRIEF OPPOSITION GOVERNMENT (SEPTEMBER- </p><p>NOVEMBER 1992) AS WELL AS PRIME MINISTER UNDER RAHMONOV (NOVEMBER </p><p>1992 - DECEMBER 1993).  (ABDULAJANOV WAS ALSO MINISTER OF BREAD </p><p>AND BRIEFLY PRIME MINISTER UNDER TAJIKISTAN\'S FIRST ELECTED </p><p>PRESIDENT, RAHMON NABIYEV.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  STILL TO COME ARE POSSIBLE NOMINATIONS BY THE GORNO </p><p>BADAKHSHAN AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS POSSIBLE </p><p>ACTION BY DUSHANBE AND OTHER DISTRICTS IN THE HISSAR AND GARM </p><p>VALLEYS.  THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE NEW POLITICAL PARTY, "THE </p><p>PARTY FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RENEWAL," AS WELL AS THE </p><p>NATIONAL LABOR FEDERATION MAY NOMINATE OTHER CANDIDATES ALTHOUGH </p><p>AT THIS POINT THAT APPEARS UNLIKELY. RATHER, IF THEY NINATE </p><p>ANYONE AT ALL, THEY WOULD LIKELY LINE UP BEHIND ABDULAJANOV OR </p><p>RAHMONOV. THE LABOR FEDERATION, DOMINATED BY KULYABIS, WILL </p><p>ALMOST CERTAINLY BACK RAHMONOV. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT/ANALYSIS:  WITH ABDULAJANOV IN THE CONTEST, THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES A REAL HORSE RACE. </p><p>WE ESTIMATE THAT ABDULAJANOV CAN COUNT ON STRONG SUPPORT IN HIS </p><p>HOME REGION OF LENINABAD, AND AMONG TAJIKISTAN\'S UZBEK COMMUNITY </p><p>WHICH MAKES UP APPROXIMATELY 24 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION.  OTHER </p><p>MINORITIES WILL LIKELY ALSO BACK ABDULAJANOV.  THE FORMER </p><p>OPPOSITION HOMELANDS IN THE GARM VALLEY, GORNO BADAKHSHAN AND THE </p><p>GARM AND PAMIRI COMMUNITIES IN FORMER KURGAN TYUBE REGION WOULD </p><p>ALMOST CERTAINLY PREFER ABDULAJANOV TO RAHMONOV -- IF THEY CHOOSE </p><p>TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTION.  THIS WOULD APPEAR TO LEAVE ONLY </p><p>THE LESS THAN UNITED KULYAB CLAN AS CLEARLY IN RAHMONOV\'S COLUMN. </p><p> </p><p>MOREOVER, THE RAPID SLIDE INTO ECONOMIC CHAOS ENTAILING UNPAID </p><p>SALARIES AND PENSIONS AND CURRENCY SHORTAGES WILL INEVITABLY CUT </p><p>DEEPLY INTO ANY PRO-RAHMONOV VOTE.  ON THE FACE OF IT, IT WOULD </p><p>APPEAR THAT ABDULAJANOV EMERGES AS THE EARLY FAVORITE IN THE </p><p>RACE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SEVERAL ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS MAY INTRUDE, HOWEVER. </p><p>THE CIVIL WAR OF 1992 BEGAN AS A NORTH-SOUTH CONFRONTATION </p><p>BETWEEN THE GARM/PAMIRI REGIONS AND THE NORTHERN (LENINABAD) </p><p>REGION. THE LENINABAD POLITICAL LEADERSHIP DREW THE KULYABIS INTO </p><p>THE STRUGGLE TRANSFORMING IT INTO A SOUTH-SOUTH CONFLICT WITH </p><p>LENINABAD ON THE SIDELINES.  RECENTLY, GROWING ANIMOSITY BETWEEN </p><p>KULYABIS AND UZBEKS HAD SEEMED TO BE PROVIDING THE BASIS FOR A </p><p>RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN KULYABIS AND GARMIS, NOTABLY IN THE FORMER </p><p>KURGAN TYUBE REGION AS POST HAS REPORTED (SEE DUSHANBE 1563). </p><p>HOWEVER, RECENT VERY HEAVY FIGHTING IN TAVILDARA DISTRICT HAS LED </p><p>TO NEW TENSIONS BETWEEN GARMIS AND KULYABIS (SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>10.  PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE HIGH STAKES INVOLVED IN THIS </p><p>RACE, MAKE IT LIKELY THAT BOTH SIDES WILL BE PREPARED TO USE </p><p>WHATEVER MEANS ARE NECESSARY TO SECURE VICTORY.  PHYSICAL </p><p>INTIMIDATION (OR WORSE) TARGETING CANDIDATES, CAMPAIGN WORKERS </p><p>AND VOTERS CAN NOT BE RULED OUT.  RAHMONNOV\'S ABILITY TO CONTROL </p><p>THE MEDIA FOR HIS PURPOSES IS LIKELY TO BE EXPLOITED.  ALREADY </p><p>HEROIC DESCRIPTIONS OF RAHMONOV AND SCANDAL MONGERING ATTACKS ON </p><p>ABDULAJANOV HAVE APPEARED IN THE GOTI CONTROLLED MEDIA.  THE </p><p>PUBLISHER OF THE PRO-ABDULAJANOV WEEKLY "TOJIKISTON" </p><p>HAS TOLD HIS EDITOR THAT FOR TWO MONTHS THE PAPER WILL NOT </p><p>PUBLISH.  HE EXPLAINED THAT IF THE PAPER TAKES A PRO-ABDULAJANOV </p><p>POSTURE THE STAFF WILL BE AT RISK.  HOWEVER, THE PAPER WILL NOT </p><p>SUBMIT TO PRESSURE TO BECOME A RAHMONOV MOUTHPIECE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  FINALLY, THE ROLE OF FOREIGN INTERESTS IS AS YET AN UNKNOWN. </p><p>A LENGTHY PAEAN TO RAHMONOV BY RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR SINKEVICH ON </p><p>NATIONAL TELEVISION AUGUST 7 PRESUMABLY DOES NOT SIGNAL A PRO- </p><p>RAHMONOV TILT BY THE RUSSIANS -- WHOM WE EXPECT TO BE EITHER </p><p>QUIETLY PRO-ABDULAJANOV OR NEUTRAL.  BOTH UZBEKISTAN AND RUSSIA </p><p>HAVE THE ABILITY TO TURN THE ECONOMIC SCREWS ON TAJIKSITAN -- OR </p><p>MAKE THINGS EASIER, TO INFLUENCE VOTES.  WE NOTE MOSCOW RADIO </p><p>COMMENTARY AUGUST 7 DESCRIBED ABDULLAJANOV AS LIKELY TO GET MOST </p><p>OF THE RUSSIAN MINORITY VOTE AS HE HAD CHAMPIONED BOTH USE OF </p><p>RUSSIAN AS AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE AND DUAL CITIZENSHIP FOR RUSSIANS </p><p>LIVING IN TAJIKISTAN. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE ONLY ASSESSMENT THAT CAN BE MADE WITH CONFIDENCE AT THIS </p><p>POINT IS THAT IT APPEARS THAT THERE WILL BE A HARD FOUGHT CONTEST </p><p>FOR PRESIDENT.  INTERNATIONAL MONITORING WILL BE CRITICAL IF </p><p>THERE IS TO BE ANY REALISTIC HOPE THAT THE VOTERS WILL HAVE A </p><p>CHANCE OF MAKING A FREE AND FAIR CHOICE. </p><p> </p><p>MCWILLIAMS </p><p></p></div>
