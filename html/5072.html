<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 000284 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NP, EUR/SE, AND DS/IP/EUR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PARM, ETTC, ASEC, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY REQUESTS ADDITIONAL BORDER CONTROL </p><p>ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. 02 ANKARA 7670 </p><p>     B. 02 STATE 165781 </p><p>     C. 01 STATE 101278 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Embassy Ankara received correspondence dated December 4 </p><p>from the Turkish Under Secretary for Customs requesting </p><p>additional radiation detection equipment be provided for </p><p>Turkish borders.  Embassy notes that the current NP/NDF </p><p>program completed its last installations in December 2002. </p><p>The Turks are requesting such cooperation be extended to </p><p>additional border posts beyond the end of the completed </p><p>program.  Embassy Ankara understands similar programs may be </p><p>possible through the EXBS program and/or the Department of </p><p>Energy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Text of the abovementioned correspondence is roughly </p><p>translated as follows: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To the US Embassy: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the MOU signed between our MFA and your Embassy </p><p>February 16, 2002, with the goal of preventing the smuggling </p><p>of radioactive and nuclear materials, your government has </p><p>completed the program to install 28 sets of radiation </p><p>detectors at 10 of our border points. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition, the work to install nuclear material detectors </p><p>at Istanbul Ataturk Airport, and Haydarpasa and Ambarli </p><p>seaports will be completed in December of 2002. </p><p>Installations will also occur at Gurbulak once the border </p><p>crossing renovations are completed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However, the Undersecretariat has considered correspondence </p><p>from our MFA dated November 15 regarding whether to continue </p><p>the radiation detector installations.  Given recent events, </p><p>likely terrorist activities and Turkey\'s geographic position, </p><p>we believe that the installation of radiation detectors at </p><p>Trabzon, Cesme, and Izmit/Derince seaports as well as Edirne </p><p>(Derekoy and Ipsala) Gaziantep (Oncupinar) border gate would </p><p>be appropriate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With the wish to increase existing mutual solidarity and </p><p>cooperation, I respectfully submit to you this information. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>/s/ </p><p>Dr. Nevzat Saygilioglu </p><p>Undersecretary </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Action Requested: Please advise on an appropriate response </p><p>to the Turkish request. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
