<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008635 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>STATE FOR EB/TPP/MTA/IPC - JURBAN AND EUR/SE </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR FOR DBIRDSEY/KALVAREZ </p><p>DEPT PASS PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KIPR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  Update on Intellectual Property Protection </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Econoff discussed intellectual property and </p><p>market access priorities with American pharmaceuticals </p><p>companies and with the copyright-based industry </p><p>associations in Istanbul.  The drug companies agreed </p><p>that they need to make the case with the new Turkish </p><p>Government on data exclusivity.  With the objective of </p><p>refuting GOT and generics producers\' arguments that data </p><p>exclusivity is too expensive to implement, Eli Lilly has </p><p>prepared detailed estimates of the cost of this policy </p><p>to the Turkish Government (approximately USD 3 million </p><p>annually).  Organizations representing the motion </p><p>picture, music and software industries continue to </p><p>identify enforcement as their main concern.  Some </p><p>interlocutors believe the new government will be more </p><p>receptive to their concerns, and these industries plan </p><p>to call on new policymakers in the near future.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Econoff met with representatives of U.S. </p><p>pharmaceuticals companies and the U.S. copyright-based </p><p>industries in Istanbul on November 21 and 22 to discuss </p><p>developments in intellectual property protection and </p><p>market access.  Econoff met with the pharmaceuticals </p><p>companies as a group, which included Eli Lilly, Pfizer, </p><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb, Wyeth, Abbott Laboratories, Merck </p><p>Sharp & Dohme, Schering Plough, Pharmacia Upjohn, </p><p>Janssen Cilag (Johnson and Johnson).  We also held a </p><p>group discussion on problems facing the copyright </p><p>industries with Erol Ozkur, Anti-Piracy Marketing </p><p>Manager, Microsoft/ Business Software Alliance (BSA); </p><p>Nasser Ali Khasawneh, Vice President, BSA; Baha </p><p>Ozyukseler, General Manager, AMPEC/ MPA (film industry); </p><p>Nilufer Sapancilar, General Manager AMPEC; and Daghan </p><p>Baydur, Chairman of MSG (composers/songwriters). </p><p>Econoff met separately with Mehih Ayracman, Sony Music </p><p>Managing Director and Board Member of MUYAP (Musical </p><p>Work Producers Society). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Drug Companies on Data Exclusivity, Price Discrimination </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In their roundtable meeting at the U.S. Consulate </p><p>on November 21, the pharmaceuticals firms did not, in </p><p>depth, address the question of reversing GOT cost-saving </p><p>measures in the health and pension funds favoring </p><p>reimbursement of generic drugs.  The discussion focused </p><p>primarily on data exclusivity and price controls and how </p><p>to address these issues with a new GOT.  Ahmed Esen, </p><p>Pfizer\'s General Manager, and Roberto Giusti, Eli </p><p>Lilly\'s General Manager, dominated the discussion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Data Exclusivity:  Roberto Giusti and his </p><p>Corporate Affairs Manager Sebnem Kocaalp made the case </p><p>that GOT implementation of data exclusivity would cost </p><p>the Turkish treasury as little as USD 3 million annually </p><p>in the form of higher reimbursements for pharmaceuticals </p><p>covered by the health and pension funds, well below the </p><p>USD 1 billion cost estimate promoted by Turkish generic </p><p>drugs manufacturers.  Lilly presented a detailed in- </p><p>house analysis to back up its estimate.  Other U.S. </p><p>companies responded very favorably to Lilly\'s analysis </p><p>and discussed various options for presenting it to the </p><p>GOT, including commissioning an independent study </p><p>through a Turkish university. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Price Discrimination:  There was less consensus </p><p>on the need to press the GOT on price controls, and even </p><p>on whether the controls discriminated against imports. </p><p>Ahmed Esen, Pfizer\'s General Manager, argued that the </p><p>entire system of price controls, for both local and </p><p>imported drugs, was not transparent and needed reform. </p><p>He suggested that a study be commissioned to examine the </p><p>impact of price controls on imported and local products. </p><p>Giusti contended that current price/margin controls were </p><p>clearly discriminatory, and noted that the European </p><p>pharmaceuticals industry association had examined the </p><p>issue and would report its conclusions in the near </p><p>future.  Roundtable participants were in general </p><p>agreement that the current margin control system, which </p><p>encourages companies to inflate costs to obtain </p><p>government approval for price increases, depresses </p><p>reported profits and tax payments by the industry. </p><p>Copyright Industries Focused on Improving Enforcement </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Representatives of the motion picture, music and </p><p>software industries maintained that small-scale street </p><p>sales of pirated material are the leading problem, </p><p>though they disagreed as to the adequacy of the GOT\'s </p><p>response.  Microsoft and BSA representatives opined that </p><p>the recently-formed, multi-agency inspection and control </p><p>committees for copyright products were functioning well </p><p>in the Istanbul region, which accounts for two-thirds of </p><p>Microsoft\'s sales in Turkey.  In a separate meeting, </p><p>Melih Ayracman, Sony\'s Managing Director told Econoff </p><p>that the committees existed largely on paper, and were </p><p>not equipped with appropriate tools (support staff, </p><p>vehicles) to fulfill their functions.  Ayracman also </p><p>raised the continuing problem of broadcast piracy. </p><p>MSG\'s Chairman told Econoff that delays and sometimes </p><p>uneven judgements from the Turkish judiciary were a </p><p>serious barrier. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Our interlocutors were cautiously optimistic that </p><p>the new GOT would take IPR protection seriously, and </p><p>they discussed making a coordinated approach to key </p><p>ministers and other officials in the near future.  Baha </p><p>Ozyukseler, of AMPEC, said it would offer to organize a </p><p>conference for judges and prosecutors on copyright </p><p>enforcement in the spring.  AMPEC pointed out that one </p><p>of the new government\'s first appointments was that of </p><p>Fikret Uccan, formerly Undersecretary in the Culture </p><p>Ministry, to the position of Undersecretary in the Prime </p><p>Ministry.  Ozyukseler opined that this might raise the </p><p>profile of IPR issues overall in the next GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Given the new government\'s interest in </p><p>attracting more foreign investment, we intend to </p><p>emphasize the link between improved IPR protection and </p><p>U.S. companies\' willingness to maintain or increase </p><p>investments in Turkey.
