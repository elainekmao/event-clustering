<p>S E C R E T COLOMBO 001016 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL: 06-11-13 </p><p>TAGS: CE, MV, AGMT, Human Rights </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 88  (06-11-03) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador E.Ashley Wills, Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  MALDIVIAN DIPNOTE RE GUANTANAMO </p><p>-          TWO SUSPECTED TIGERS NABBED IN COLOMBO </p><p> </p><p>MALDIVIAN DIPNOTE RE GUANTANAMO </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>1.  (S) Please see our class email dated 6/10/03 re a </p><p>dipnote received June 10 from the Maldives.  In this </p><p>dipnote, the Maldivian MFA states that it has heard that </p><p>a Maldivian national held at Guantanamo Bay may be </p><p>released soon.  The MFA would like the USG to clarify the </p><p>matter. (Note:  In asking this question, the Maldivian </p><p>MFA clearly wants to know whether to continue to push its </p><p>long-standing request to send a team to interrogate this </p><p>individual.)  Please get back to us with any information </p><p>re this matter ASAP.  Thank you. (POL) </p><p> </p><p>TWO SUSPECTED TIGERS NABBED IN COLOMBO </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (C) FYI: In a matter that is receiving a lot of press </p><p>play here, two suspected LTTE cadre were reportedly </p><p>stopped during a random police check in central Colombo </p><p>on the evening of June 10.  One of the suspects allegedly </p><p>took cyanide to avoid being captured alive and is said to </p><p>be in critical condition at a Colombo hospital.  The </p><p>other suspected cadre is in custody and is being </p><p>questioned. (Note:  It is possible that the suspects may </p><p>be involved in trying to assassinate anti-LTTE Tamils. </p><p>As we have reported, the LTTE has pretty clearly been </p><p>involved in well over a dozen killings that have targeted </p><p>Army informants and Tamil political opponents in recent </p><p>weeks/months.  This may be the first time that LTTE cadre </p><p>involved in these killings have been caught.) (Note:  In </p><p>what may prove to be a related development, two police </p><p>officers were reportedly captured by the LTTE late June </p><p>10 near Batticaloa in the east.   There is speculation </p><p>that the two policemen may be held by the LTTE until some </p><p>sort of exchange is worked out for the two cadre captured </p><p>in Colombo.) (POL) </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
