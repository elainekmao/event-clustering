O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, KTEX, VM </p><p>SUBJECT: VIETNAM: TEXTILE ALLOCATION BEGINS WITH CONFUSION </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) HO CHI MINH CITY 0500    B) HANOI 1467 </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>----------- </p><p>1.  (SBU) The textile quota allocation process, which began on </p><p>June 11, has drawn widespread complaints from buyers and producers </p><p>and has already gone through at least one revision.  In Phase I of </p><p>the allocation process - in which companies receive a share of </p><p>quota based on past performance - many companies received much </p><p>less quota than they expected, when compared with their </p><p>calculations based on their interpretation of the criteria earlier </p><p>publicized by the GVN.  In a meeting with a group of foreign </p><p>industry representatives, officials from VITAS, the Vietnam </p><p>Textile Apparel and Textile Association, acknowledged that the </p><p>Ministry of Trade (MOT) had been holding back or under-allocating </p><p>quota based on past performance.  At the meeting, industry reps </p><p>stated they were prepared to bring their concerns to the U.S. </p><p>Ambassador and to the Minister of Trade.  According to the foreign </p><p>industry reps, MOT officials then agreed to once again update </p><p>performance-based quota, this time using the criteria as </p><p>originally stipulated in the government circular.  (Post Note: MOT </p><p>has told Embassy Hanoi that they already apply these criteria). </p><p>Transparency is - apparently - a work in progress.  Post will </p><p>continue to monitor the business pulse in HCMC.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Better Late and Incomplete -- Than Never </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>2.  (SBU) On June 11, the GVN issued the first textile quota </p><p>allocations in "Phase I" of the quota allocation process. </p><p>According to foreign buyers and producers, as well as the Vietnam </p><p>Textile and Apparel Association (VITAS), the lists were late and </p><p>incomplete.  MOT released an updated list over the weekend, but </p><p>companies still complained to Congen Econoff that the quota </p><p>allocations were incomplete.  In this Phase I allocation, which </p><p>was to distribute 80 percent of the performance-based quota to </p><p>companies who had submitted timely documentation, several </p><p>companies told ConGen Econoff that they had received far less than </p><p>their preliminary calculations would have indicated.  Some </p><p>companies, many of whom documented substantial past performance in </p><p>the qualifying period, did not even appear on the list or were </p><p>missing quota allocations in key categories.  Companies have once </p><p>again begun making the pilgrimage to the Ministry of Trade in </p><p>Hanoi to plead their cases.  Many of these firms say they have </p><p>been assured by MOT officials that their quotas will be adjusted </p><p>or that, because "the list is not finished," their firms will be </p><p>added to the list.  Once again, textile firms are on pins and </p><p>needles (sorry) as they try to sort out exactly what is going on </p><p>and how to get a piece of the action. </p><p> </p><p>Apparently Transparent -- at First </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>3.  (U) In the past few months, GVN officials have stressed </p><p>repeatedly the goal of making the quota allocation process as fair </p><p>and as transparent as possible.  Various ministries accepted input </p><p>from buyers and producers as they developed the quota allocation </p><p>system.  The Ministries of Trade, Industry, and Planning and </p><p>Investment jointly issued a circular, which formally laid out the </p><p>criteria for allocation (ref A).  MOT posted this decree along </p><p>with other relevant regulations on the MOT website.  Export </p><p>figures by category were also posted and updated every few days so </p><p>that companies could see how much quota remained in each category. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) All of this transparency quickly became obscured, </p><p>however, when the first quota allocations were announced on June </p><p>11.  This was several days after the "end of May" deadline </p><p>specified in the aforementioned circular.  Many companies who had </p><p>complied with documentation requirements for quota allocation did </p><p>not receive any quota at all.  Some companies received </p><p>substantially less than the amounts they had anticipated.  In one </p><p>case, for example, an American firm received 93 percent of what it </p><p>expected in one category, but only about 40 percent in another. </p><p>The general manager of one Hong Kong firm complained to ConGen </p><p>Econoff that he had not slept for days because his firm was not </p><p>even on the list.  His firm later appeared on the updated list, </p><p>but received far less quota than anticipated and no quota at all </p><p>in several key categories.  The export figures by category have </p><p>not been updated since June 6 on the MOT website, adding to </p><p>business anxiety in HCMC. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Producers and buyers are reluctant to ascribe any of </p><p>this confusion to an attempt by GVN officials to unfairly allocate </p><p>quota to preferred firms.  Producers note that no group in </p><p>particular appears to have benefited from this initial allocation, </p><p>although unless one knows the past performance of each individual </p><p>company, one cannot be absolutely certain.  GVN officials have </p><p>told Embassy Hanoi officers that they have been overwhelmed by </p><p>this entire exercise and at the same time are trying to comply </p><p>with requests to provide detailed export data to U.S. Customs (ref </p><p>B). </p><p> </p><p>We feel your pain... </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>6.  (U) Interest in the U.S. textile and garment market is </p><p>enormous in Ho Chi Minh City, which is the center of the country\'s </p><p>textile and apparel industry.  With less than one week\'s notice, </p><p>an American Chamber of Commerce seminar on U.S. Customs </p><p>documentation requirements for textile imports drew more than 250 </p><p>participants.  At the meeting, the Secretary General of VITAS Mr. </p><p>Tran Duc Thinh acknowledged the frustrations of the entire </p><p>industry as the quota allocation process had begun.  He urged </p><p>companies to register their complaints and promised that VITAS </p><p>would call a meeting in a few days to review the situation with </p><p>its members.  He stated that the MOT was working hard to get </p><p>things right, but this was the first time MOT had to allocate </p><p>textile quota for the U.S. market. (Note: For several years the </p><p>GVN has been allocating a much smaller textile quota for the EU </p><p>market.) </p><p> </p><p>You bet you will! </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>7.  (SBU) According to one major American buyer in Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City, however, the ground may be shifting.  On June 16, this </p><p>buyer, along with representatives of several foreign business </p><p>groups in Ho Chi Minh City, met with Mr. Le Quoc An, the Chairman </p><p>of Vinatex and of VITAS, and Mr. Le Van Dao, the incoming </p><p>Secretary General of VITAS and former Deputy Director of the MOT </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Import-Export Department.  Foreign business groups have been </p><p>lobbying the GVN collectively on textile and quota allocation </p><p>issues. These businesses produce or purchase hundreds of millions </p><p>of dollars of garments here every year.  According to the American </p><p>buyer, An and Dao told her that the MOT had been using a </p><p>"different formula", not one based closely on the criteria in the </p><p>GVN circular outlining the process.   According to An and Dao, </p><p>using the current "formula" resulted in smaller quotas, by about </p><p>10% - 30%.  This allowed the MOT to withhold more quota for later </p><p>allocation. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) These foreign business representatives were highly </p><p>critical of this reported approach and informed An and Dao that </p><p>they were meeting separately later this week with U.S. Ambassador </p><p>Burghardt and with the Minister of Trade.  They wanted to give </p><p>them a good report, they said, but as the situation stood now, </p><p>this would not be possible.  According to the leader of this </p><p>textile group, An and Dao reacted by telephoning the new Deputy </p><p>Director of Import-Export at MOT (the key person in charge of </p><p>handling quota allocation for the U.S. market.)  According to the </p><p>business reps, An and Dao urged him in the strongest terms ("fix </p><p>this or your job in jeopardy") to release new quota figures based </p><p>on the "correct formula."   According to ConGen contact, An and </p><p>Dao told the foreign reps that yet another "revised" quota </p><p>allocation list should be released in a couple of days, this time </p><p>using the criteria "as set out" in the GVN circular. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------------ </p><p>9.  (SBU)   ConGen contact has been a good source of inside </p><p>information in the past.  However, neither An or Dao directly work </p><p>or speak for MOT, and every source in this cable has a horse in </p><p>this race.   Embassy contacted MOT officials who were in charge of </p><p>drafting the circular, creating and applying the criteria, and </p><p>allocating quota.  They stated they were unaware of any </p><p>conversation as reported by the American industry rep, and noted </p><p>that there is no specific formula advocated in the circular. </p><p>Rather, these officials said they set up a formula based on their </p><p>own criteria and, as previously reported, scheduled the allocation </p><p>in two phases.  The first phase was smaller than originally </p><p>announced and this has led to problems and unease among industry </p><p>reps. The second phase, which will now be larger than planned, </p><p>will happen later this month.  Depending which side of the fence </p><p>one sits on, this may also be the "revised" allocation that </p><p>industry reps are waiting for. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU)  That said, there is clearly unhappiness among the </p><p>foreign business community regarding the allocation of quota.  For </p><p>them, these recent quota allocations appear to concentrate power </p><p>for quota decisions in just a few hands.  Without any MOT </p><p>explanatory formula or calculations for allocating past </p><p>performance quota, the foreign business community has serious </p><p>concerns about the apparent disconnect between their expected </p><p>quota allocations (based on their own calculations) and what in </p><p>fact MOT has allocated to them.  If MOT can improve its </p><p>performance by responding to industry\'s concerns - ensuring that </p><p>the second phase more closely follows industry\'s recommendations </p><p>regarding the application of criteria and "formula" - it would be </p><p>excellent news for Vietnam.  Garment and textile producers would </p><p>get the performance-based quota they were promised, thus </p><p>strengthening the competitiveness of the industry here.  And, it </p><p>would be another step on the road to transparency.  Because the </p><p>GVN had issued a circular outlining quota criteria, buyers and </p><p>producers were able to lobby the MOT directly for its proper </p><p>implementation.  Of course, whether or not MOT will tweak its </p><p>method of allocation in Phase II, as well as increase </p><p>transparency, remains to be seen. </p><p> </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
