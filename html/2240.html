(U) This is an action request.  Please see para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU/NF) A Pacific Architects and Engineers (PA&E) </p><p>contract employee has alleged significant contract fraud on </p><p>the part of PA&E contract employees in Nigeria. PA&E is the </p><p>Department of State contractor for Operation Focus Relief </p><p>logistics. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU/NF) According to the employee, both expatriate and </p><p>host nation employees are involved in significant contract </p><p>fraud.  Specifically, the PA&E in-country headquarters </p><p>(Abuja) accountant, a Nigerian national, and her brother, are </p><p>alleged to have colluded with other Nigerian employees of </p><p>PA&E, as well as expatriate employees, to defraud the U.S. </p><p>government.  This is achieved by: overcharging for services </p><p>and equipment and pocketing the surplus; arranging for the </p><p>accountant,s extended family to be awarded contracts for </p><p>services and equipment in order to effect the overcharges; </p><p>ordering the destruction of receipts; and, threatening </p><p>expatriate employees with bodily harm if they blow the </p><p>whistle. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU/NF) The person who made the above allegations has </p><p>been hurriedly removed as a PA&E employee and has left the </p><p>country.  Other PA&E expatriate employees will leave over the </p><p>next three weeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU/NF) ACTION REQUEST: Embassy requests that the </p><p>Department quickly send a joint PA&E/Department of State </p><p>audit team to investigate the matter.  Time is of the </p><p>essence.  Operation Focus Relief ends December 15.  PA&E </p><p>Nigeria has begun shutting down operations and transferring </p><p>personnel.  The nature of the allegations, given the </p><p>extensive relationship between PA&E and the department, makes </p><p>this a serious issue. END ACTION REQUEST. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
