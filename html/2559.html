<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 000711 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA -- ZIMBABWE IN THE NEWS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter. Reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) To the apparent chagrin of President Obasanjo, news of </p><p>the President\'s late January discussions with President </p><p>Mugabe in Harare has leaked.  ThisDay February 26 reported </p><p>Presidential Special Assistant Tunji Oseni refuting rumors </p><p>that Obasanjo offered asylum to Mugabe. In his statement, </p><p>Oseni claimed that rumors of the offer and of Nigeria </p><p>positioning a helicopter in Harare to afford Mugabe a quick </p><p>exit should he lose the election were "baseless and untrue." </p><p>Oseni reportedly said the two Heads of State never discussed </p><p>the possibility of Mugabe\'s departure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Oseni\'s public disclaimer, however, does not jibe </p><p>exactly with what NSA Aliyu Mohammed told us privately. </p><p>During a February conversation with Ambassador Jeter </p><p>(septel), Mohammed stated that Obasanjo recommended to Mugabe </p><p>that he retire and not seek reelection. However, Mugabe said </p><p>he was committed to running and could not back down. The </p><p>Zimbabwean reportedly hinted that he might consider </p><p>retirement after winning the election. ( Mugabe\'s last </p><p>statement strikes us probably as unlikely as it is illogical.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Meanwhile, the Nigerian Labour Congress and the </p><p>Ghanaian Trade Union Congress, after a conference in Abuja, </p><p>issued a communique condemning electoral restrictions in </p><p>Zimbabwe. The communique described recent Government of </p><p>Zimbabwe measures as restrictive, repressive and calculated </p><p>to perpetuate Mugabe\'s tenure in office.  NLC castigation of </p><p>Mugabe is a noteworthy sign that the NLC leadership believes </p><p>its commitment to democracy should outweigh other </p><p>considerations that, in the past, often kept organized labor </p><p>from echoing Western criticism of many African leaders\' </p><p>undemocratic practices. The NLC also might have a more </p><p>parochial reason for the statement.  It probably wanted to </p><p>send a signal to domestic politicians that organized labor </p><p>also will not endorse electoral skullduggery at home in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Comment: Based on what Mohammed told us, Oseni\'s press </p><p>denial is not completely accurate. Because of Obasanjo\'s </p><p>involvement in Zimbabwe and his personal approach to </p><p>resolving crisis, it would not come as a shock if Obasanjo </p><p>offered asylum to Mugabe. (Nigeria has certainly harbored </p><p>deposed leaders before.) However, before broaching retirement </p><p>with Mugabe, Obasanjo would have given the issue some </p><p>thought. He would have had in mind that Mugabe would need a </p><p>place to retire to and that place would have to accept Mugabe </p><p>while being acceptable to him. In Obasanjo\'s mind, Nigeria </p><p>would be just as good if not a better option than any other </p><p>country. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
