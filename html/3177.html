<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003330 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: KISL, PHUM, PGOV, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: SHARIA PROFS DISMISSED, SOME REINSTATED; MYSTIFIED </p><p>JORDANIANS BLAME THE USG </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY.  Three Jordanian universities recently </p><p>dismissed 8 professors, most of whom were Sharia professors, </p><p>without explanation.  Most suspect the professors were </p><p>dismissed because of their political views and/or their </p><p>background as Saudi-educated \'Salafi\' proponents.  Media </p><p>reports and embassy sources indicate that four of those </p><p>dismissed have since been reinstated.  As there is no clear </p><p>explanation for the dismissals or subsequent reinstatements, </p><p>the Jordanian academic and political communities have been </p><p>left mystified, with many pointing, by default, to the USG as </p><p>somehow responsible.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>PROFESSORS DISMISSED FROM SHARIA FACULTY </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  At the beginning of June, Jordan University, Mu\'tah </p><p>University and Yarmouk University dismissed a total of seven </p><p>professors from their Sharia faculties (JU dismissed a </p><p>professor from its school of humanities as well).  All of the </p><p>Sharia professors dismissed were trained in Saudi Arabia in </p><p>the Salafi school of thought.  Fawzi Samhoury (protect) a </p><p>long-standing and reliable human rights contact, reports that </p><p>despite media characterizations of the group as \'moderates\', </p><p>in reality several of the professors had been preaching a </p><p>markedly virulent and anti-USG strain of Salafi thought prior </p><p>to their dismissals.  A few, such as Dr. Ali Al-Otoum (fired </p><p>from Yarmouk University) have long-standing ties to the </p><p>Muslim Brotherhood.  That said, not all of the 8 professors </p><p>could be characterized as political extremists.  Predictably, </p><p>Jordanians who are stridently anti-USG are more likely to </p><p>characterize the group as \'moderates\'.  In a June 13 meeting </p><p>with POLOFF, an anti-USG, US-educated sociology professor </p><p>reported that the group as whole was moderate, and that a </p><p>couple of the dismissed professors were so docile that many </p><p>had believed them to be "operatives" of the GOJ.  (NOTE: </p><p>This contact, after a short discussion of the dismissed </p><p>professors, used the remainder of the meeting as an </p><p>opportunity to revel in a hyperbolic rant against the USG). </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>REACTION: UNCLE SAM DID IT </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  As is usually the case with government intervention </p><p>in the universities, the dismissals received scant media </p><p>coverage, but have become a major topic of conversation in </p><p>political circles.  Dr. Ahmad al-Awayishah (dismissed from </p><p>JU) was quoted by the IAF weekly al-Sabil, saying "We will </p><p>continue to say that the people who carry out the martyrdom </p><p>operations are martyrs, who will be rewarded by almighty </p><p>God".  Both contacts above reported that, without a clear </p><p>explanation for the dismissals, people by default blame the </p><p>USG war on terrorism for the actions, with a conspiracy </p><p>theory now afloat that points the finger at the CIA.  A </p><p>well-connected and Islamic-leaning newspaper editor told us </p><p>the dismissals "clumsy" and ill-informed, and noted that more </p><p>radical voices in the university had not been touched.  Like </p><p>most Jordanians, he assumed the U.S. was somehow behind the </p><p>dismissals. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>REINSTATEMENT, FOR FOUR </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  In yet another twist, during the third week of June, </p><p>four of the professors (3 from JU and 1 from Mu\'tah) were </p><p>\'reinstated\'.  Samhoury confirmed that those reinstated were </p><p>the most moderate of the group, and the ones whose dismissals </p><p>had left him most confused.  Still, he remained concerned </p><p>that there has been no formal explanation about why any of </p><p>the dismissals or reinstatements occurred.  The IAF called </p><p>for the immediate reinstatement of the four who remain </p><p>ousted, and questioned the constitutionality of their </p><p>dismissals in the June 18 issue of al-Sabeel.  As a result of </p><p>these seemingly arbitrary dismissals/reinstatements, </p><p>professors report a sharpened concern about government </p><p>intervention and intimidation within the academic community. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  The fact that all 8 professors were dismissed at the </p><p>same time and from different universities has predictably </p><p>raised suspicions that this is part of an orchestrated </p><p>campaign to rid the academic community of undesirable, </p><p>extremist voices.  This, coupled with animosity toward USG </p><p>policies in the region, has led many critics to conclude that </p><p>the USG is in some way involved in the dismissals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
