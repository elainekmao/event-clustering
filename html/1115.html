(C) SUMMARY: SEVERAL WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND </p><p>BUSINESSPEOPLE TOLD AMBASSADOR MCDONALD JUNE 5 OF THE </p><p>CONTINUING POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THEIR OCCUPIED </p><p>PROPERTIES AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS, DURING PRIVATE </p><p>MEETINGS WITH THEM IN MASHONALAND WEST PROVINCE.  A </p><p>BLACK MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) OFFICIAL ALSO </p><p>INFORMED THE AMBASSADOR ABOUT THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE IN THIS AREA, WHICH HE SAID WAS ORCHESTRATED BY </p><p>SENIOR OFFICIALS OF ZANU-PF AND CARRIED OUT BY HIRED </p><p>THUGS ON BEHALF OF THE RULING PARTY.  THE BASIC MESSAGE </p><p>WAS THAT THE FARM OCCUPATIONS HAVE NOTING TO DO WITH </p><p>LAND REFORM, BUT MERELY PROVIDED A PRETEXT UNDER WHICH </p><p>TO MOVE "WAR VETERANS" ON TO COMMERCIAL AND COMMUNAL </p><p>LANDS IN ORDER TO TERRORIZE PEOPLE INTO SUPPORTING ZANU- </p><p>PF DURING THE RUN-UP TO THE JUNE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION. </p><p>THE CONSENSUS WAS THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO PURSUE </p><p>SERIOUS LAND REFORM DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03078  01 OF 04  071608Z </p><p>UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.  NEVERTHELESS, THESE CONTACTS </p><p>MAINTAIN THAT THE MDC CONTINUES TO HAVE BROAD SUPPORT IN </p><p>THESE COMMUNITIES AND WILL WIN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF </p><p>SEATS.  THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, IS MOVING TO </p><p>DISENFRANCHISE PRIMARILY WHITE VOTERS BY OMITTING THEIR </p><p>NAMES FROM THE VOTERS\' ROLLS AND MISINFORMING THEM ABOUT </p><p>THEIR RIGHT TO CORRECT SUCH OMISSIONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON JUNE 5 AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, ACCOMPANIED BY </p><p>POLOFF AND THE RSO ASSISTANT, TRAVELED TO SOME OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S MOST PRODUCTIVE COMMERCIAL FARMLAND, IN THE </p><p>MASHONALAND WEST PROVINCE IN THE TOWNS OF BANKET, </p><p>CHINOYI AND DOMA.  MANY OF THESE FARMS ARE ON THE LIST </p><p>OF 804 PROPERTIES PROPOSED FOR IMMINENT GOVERNMENT </p><p>ACQUISITION (REFTEL A).  THIS PROVINCE HAS ALSO SEEN </p><p>SOME OF THE MOST EXTREME POLITICAL VIOLENCE, INCLUDING </p><p>THE DEATH OF TWO MDC ORGANIZERS IN KARIBA TOWN, AND </p><p>BRUTALIZATION OF FARM WORKERS IN RAFFINGORA AND OTHER </p><p>AREAS (REFTEL B).  AMBASSADOR MCDONALD MADE UNANNOUNCED </p><p>CALLS ON SEVERAL BUSINESS PEOPLE WHO WERE EAGER AND </p><p>PLEASED TO TALK ABOUT THE ONGOING POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN </p><p>THE AREA.  IN BANKET WE STOPPED AT ITICON IRRIGATION </p><p>CONSULTANTS, WHICH SUPPLIES IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT TO MOST </p><p>OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS IN THE AREA.  THE MANAGERS </p><p>WITH WHOM WE SPOKE SAID THERE HAD BEEN WIDESPREAD </p><p>POLITICAL INTIMIDATION IN THE AREA, PARTICULARLY THE </p><p>COMMUNITY OF RAFFINGORA.  SIMILARLY, WE HEARD OF MORE </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OWNER </p><p>OF THE BANKET FARMERS\' CENTER, A PROSPEROUS LOOKING FARM </p><p>EQUIPMENT SUPPLY COMPANY, WHO IS AN ADMITTED MDC </p><p>ORGANIZER AND FINANCIAL BACKER IN THAT COMMUNITY.  YET </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03078  01 OF 04  071608Z </p><p>MORE ATTACKS AND INCIDENTS OF HUMILIATION OF FARM OWNERS </p><p>AND WORKERS WERE DESCRIBED TO US DURING A CALL ON </p><p>OFFICIALS AT THE ELECTRO-ELECT COMPANY IN CHINHOYI, </p><p>WHICH PROVIDES ELECTRICAL FIXTURES AND REPAIRS </p><p>AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT FOR THE AREA\'S COMMERCIAL FARMS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ACCORDING TO THESE BUSINESSPEOPLE AND COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS: </p><p> </p><p>-- COMMERCIAL AND COMMUNAL FARM WORKERS ARE FORCED TO </p><p>ATTEND ALL NIGHT ZANU-PF POLITICAL RALLIES AND BEATEN </p><p>FOR ANY SIGNS OF RESISTANCE OR OPPOSITION PARTY SUPPORT. </p><p>WHILE THOSE BEATINGS OCCURRED ON ALL OCCUPIED </p><p>PROPERTIES, THE CURRENT STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON THE MORE </p><p>ISOLATED WORKERS IN THE COMMUNAL AREAS, TEACHERS AND </p><p>NURSES; </p><p> </p><p>-- MANY FARM WORKER WOMEN HAVE BEEN RAPED ON THE FARMS, </p><p>AS WELL AS AT LEAST ONE MDC SUPPORTER WHO WAS TAKEN TO A </p><p>NOW NOTORIOUS HOTEL IN KARIBA, THE ZAMBEZI VALLEY HOTEL, </p><p>WHERE SHE WAS GANG RAPED BY ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS.  THE </p><p>FEMALE MAYOR OF KARIBA AND HER HUSBAND, WHO WERE FORCED </p><p>TO ALLOW THEIR PREMISES TO BE USED BY ZANU-PF THUGS, </p><p>REPORTEDLY OWN THIS HOTEL.

(C) THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAS BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY </p><p>ORGANIZED BY KEY ZANU-PF OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>GOVERNOR FOR MASHONALAND CENTRAL, BORDER GEZI, WHO HAS </p><p>BEEN IN COMPETITION WITH THE MASHONALAND WEST GOVERNOR, </p><p>PETER CHANESTA, AND THE MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND </p><p>TECHNOLOGY, IGNATIUS CHOMBO, FOR TURF AND POLITICAL </p><p>FAVOR WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE, ACCORDING TO THESE </p><p>MASHONALAND BUSINESSPEOPLE.  CONSEQUENTLY, GEZI HAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03078  02 OF 04  071608Z </p><p>PERSONALLY SPEARHEADED VIOLENCE ON THE BORDER OF THE TWO </p><p>PROVINCES, WHICH HAS SPILLED OVER TO RAFFINGORA AND </p><p>CENTENARY, SITES OF THE MOST BRUTAL POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p>IN THE AREA.  THE OTHER RULING PARTY POLITICIANS, WHILE </p><p>NOT AS VIOLENT AS GEZI, HAVE ENCOURAGED THEIR SUPPORTERS </p><p>TO FORCEFULLY ASSURE THE PARTY\'S VICTORY IN THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  THE MANAGER OF THE BANKET </p><p>FARMERS\' CENTER GAVE US A COPY OF A LETTER WRITTEN BY A </p><p>LOCAL CATHOLIC PARISH PRIEST TO THE ZANU-PF CANDIDATE </p><p>FOR BANKET, PLEADING WITH HIM TO STOP ADVOCATING </p><p>VIOLENCE, SPECIFICALLY THE CANDIDATE\'S CALL FOR DEATH TO </p><p>MDC SUPPORTERS.  THE BUSINESSPEOPLE URGED OUR STRONG </p><p>SUPPORT FOR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ELECTION MONITORS </p><p>TO ENSURE THAT THE VOTE WAS NOT STOLEN. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE BANKET MANAGER TOLD US THAT DESPITE THE VIOLENCE </p><p>AND INTIMIDATION, HE AND OTHER WHITE BUSINESSMEN </p><p>CONTINUED TO SUPPORT THE MDC.  HE SAID HE HELPED MDC </p><p>CANDIDATES GET ON THE BALLOT FOR THE PARLIAMENTARY VOTE </p><p>AND SOLICITED FUNDS FOR THE OPPOSITION PARTY.  THE MDC </p><p>OFFICIAL WHO WAS TO APPROVE THE CANDIDACY OF MDC </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES AT THE NOMINATING CENTER ON JUNE 3 WAS </p><p>RUN OFF THE ROAD THAT MORNING, BUT SURVIVED AND ARRIVED </p><p>IN TIME TO ENSURE THE REGISTRATION OF THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY CANDIDATES, HE INFORMED.  BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF </p><p>EACH CONSTITUENCY IN THE AREA, THE MDC ORGANIZER </p><p>ESTIMATED THAT THE MDC WOULD TAKE BETWEEN 75 TO 80 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE KEY AREAS IN MASHONALALAND WEST, WITH THE </p><p>EXCEPTION OF ZVIMBA SOUTH, MUGABE\'S HOME AREA.  MDC </p><p>CANDIDATES IN THE AREA CANNOT CAMPAIGN, HOWEVER, BECAUSE </p><p>OF THE THREATS AGAINST THEM AND THEIR SUPPORTERS BY WAR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03078  02 OF 04  071608Z </p><p>VETERANS, ACCORDING TO THIS BUSINESSMAN. </p><p> </p><p>REGISTRATION AND CAMPAIGN CONCERNS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) ALL THE BUSINESS PEOPLE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT </p><p>WHETHER THEY WOULD BE INCLUDED ON THE VOTERS\' ROLLS. </p><p>THEY NOTED THAT NO REGISTRATION RECEIPTS HAD BEEN </p><p>ISSUED, AS WAS THE NORM IN PREVIOUS ELECTIONS.  THERE IS </p><p>HOWEVER, NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO ISSUE SUCH RECEIPTS SO </p><p>COURT CHALLENGES TO THE OMISSION OF THEIR NAMES WOULD BE </p><p>DIFFICULT.  ADDITIONALLY, IT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO REMOVE EUROPEAN SOUNDING NAMES </p><p>FROM THE ROLLS, AND HAS STATED THAT IT WILL UNILATERALLY </p><p>STRIKE THE NAMES OF ANYONE BELIEVED TO STILL HOLD A </p><p>BRITISH PASSPORT.  SOME OF THE WHITE BUSINESS PEOPLE </p><p>SAID THEIR NAMES WERE NOT ON THE ROLLS WHEN THEY </p><p>INSPECTED IT RECENTLY, DESPITE HAVING SIGNED UP ALONG </p><p>WITH ALL THEIR BLACK EMPLOYEES AT THEIR WORK PLACE. </p><p>THESE WHITES SAID THE INSPECTION OFFICIALS SAID THEY </p><p>COULD NOT VOTE IN THE UPCOMING PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION </p><p>AND THAT ANY CORRECTION WOULD ONLY APPLY TO FUTURE </p><p>ELECTIONS.  THIS INFORMATION CONTRADICTS THE REGISTRAR </p><p>GENERAL\'S PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE VOTERS\' ROLLS, </p><p>WHICH ARE OPEN FOR INSPECTION FORM JUNE 1 TO 13 ACROSS </p><p>THE COUNTY, WILL BE AMENDED DURING THE ELEVEN DAYS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7574 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  03078  03 OF 04  071608Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00 </p><p>      COME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  ANHR-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /011W </p><p>                  ------------------602F6D  071609Z /38 </p><p>P 071612Z JUN 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6237 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 HARARE 003078 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/07/00 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, KDEM, EAGR, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: POLITICALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE: SHOCKING </p><p>PERSONAL TESTIMONIALS FROM COMMERCIAL FARMERS, </p><p>BUSINESSPEOPLE, AND MDC ACTIVISTS </p><p> </p><p>BEFORE VOTING TO CORRECT OMISSIONS.  THERE HAS ALSO BEEN </p><p>ONLY A LIMITED CAMPAIGN ON THE NEED FOR ALL VOTERS TO </p><p>INSPECT THE ROLLS, CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS HARD TO TELL AT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03078  03 OF 04  071608Z </p><p>THIS POINT HOW WIDESPREAD VOTER DISENFRANCHISEMENT MAY </p><p>BE OR WHETHER PEOPLE ARE BEING ALLOWED TO CORRECT </p><p>ERRORS.  EVEN SOME MDC CANDIDATES WERE ORIGINALLY </p><p>OMITTED FROM THE ROLLS AND WERE SUBSEQUENTLY ALLOWED TO </p><p>HAVE THEIR NAMES ADDED.  THIS MAY NOT, HOWEVER, BE THE </p><p>CASE FOR THE AVERAGE VOTER. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) AN MDC EXECUTIVE MEMBER WHO IS EMPLOYED AT ONE </p><p>OF THE COMPANIES WE VISITED TOLD US THAT HIS PARTY IS </p><p>UNABLE TO CAMPAIGN IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, SPECIFICALLY </p><p>MASHONALAND WEST AND CENTRAL, BECAUSE OF THE ATTACKS ON </p><p>THEIR CANDIDATES AND VOTERS.  THE MDC CAN NO LONGER GO </p><p>INTO CERTAIN RURAL AREAS TO ADDRESS THE WIDESPREAD VOTER </p><p>INTIMIDATION OR TO CORRECT MISINFORMATION BEING SPREAD </p><p>ABOUT ITS PARTY, HE ADDED.  THE MDC OFFICIAL THEN </p><p>RECITED A HORRIFIC STORY OF AN MDC ORGANIZER IN KARIBA </p><p>BEING DRAGGED FROM HIS WORKPLACE AND BEATEN TO DEATH BY </p><p>ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS, DRIVEN AROUND TOWN, AND THEN HIS </p><p>CORPSE HAVING BEEN DUMPED AT HIS HOME.  SIMILARLY, THE </p><p>MDC OFFICIAL AND OTHERS IN THE AREA ECHOED STORIES OF </p><p>TORTURE OF OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS AT THE ZAMBEZI VALLEY </p><p>HOTEL IN KARIBA, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A LOCAL WARLORD, </p><p>"REX JESUS."  REX JESUS AND 14 OTHERS WERE ARRESTED FOR </p><p>THE MURDER OF THE KARIBA MDC OFFICIAL, BUT FEW EXPECT </p><p>HIM TO BE PROSECUTED.  THE MDC REPRESENTATIVE SAID EVEN </p><p>SENIOR POLICE OFFICIALS IN KARIBA WERE INVOLVED IN </p><p>COVERING UP THE ATTACKS ON OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN THE </p><p>AREA.  MDC SUPPORTERS WERE EVEN FREQUENTLY BEATEN IN ONE </p><p>POLICE STATION IN KARIBA BY ZANU-PF OFFICIALS, UNTIL </p><p>COMPLAINTS WERE MADE TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS AND THE </p><p>COMMISSIONER, IDENTIFIED BY THE SURNAME "MBUNDU" WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03078  03 OF 04  071608Z </p><p>TRANSFERRED.  THE MDC OFFICIAL SAID THE VICTIMIZATION </p><p>CAMPAIGN HAD SHIFTED FROM GROUPS, I.E., WHITE FARMERS, </p><p>TO INDIVIDUALS FARM WORKERS OR OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS. </p><p> </p><p>SECRECY OF BALLOT QUESTIONED </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) AN ADDITIONAL AREA OF GREAT CONCERN WAS THE </p><p>CONFIDENTIALLY OF THE BALLOT.  SEVERAL OF THE WHITE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BUSINESSMEN EXPRESSED FEARS THAT THE BALLOT PAPERS WOULD </p><p>BE NUMBERED TO CORRESPOND WITH THE NAMES OF THE VOTERS, </p><p>THUS PINPOINTING THEM FOR RETRIBUTION AFTER THE </p><p>ELECTION.  OTHERS NOTED THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND </p><p>RULING PARTY SUPPORTERS WERE TELLING ILLITERATE RURAL </p><p>VOTERS THAT THEIR VOTE WOULD BE MONITORED AND THAT </p><p>ENTIRE COMMUNITIES WOULD BE PUNISHED IF ANY OF ITS </p><p>MEMBERS VOTED FOR THE OPPOSITION.  WHILE SOME CIVIL </p><p>SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS ARE PLANNING A MODEST CIVIC </p><p>EDUCATION EXERCISE TO UNDERSCORE THE SECRECY OF THE </p><p>BALLOT, THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE ELECTRONIC MEDIA, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE STATE-OWNED RADIO, AND WILL HAVE ONLY A </p><p>LIMITED REACH IN THE RURAL AREAS.  THE LEGAL RESOURCES </p><p>FOUNDATION (LRF) IS ONE SUCH GROUP THAT HAS PREPARED A </p><p>MILLION COPIES OF A CARTOON FLYER TO PROMOTE THE SECRET </p><p>BALLOT.  THIS IDEA WAS PROPOSED TO LRF BY CAMBODIAN </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER, DR. KEK GALABRU, ONE OF THE EXPERTS </p><p>WHO VISITED ZIMBABWE LAST MONTH UNDER THE EMBASSY\'S </p><p>"EMINENT PERSONS PROGRAM." </p><p> </p><p>FARM INVASIONS NOT ABOUT LAND REFORM </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03078  03 OF 04  071608Z </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) IN DOMA, THE AMBASSADOR HAD A LUNCHEON WITH </p><p>SEVEN TOBACCO AND OTHER COMMERCIAL FARMERS WHO </p><p>REPRESENTED PROPERTY OWNERS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL AREA </p><p>NORTH OF HARARE, COVERING TWO PROVINCES, AND FROM </p><p>OCCUPIED FARMS IN THOSE AREAS.  THE LUNCHEON HOST\'S FARM </p><p>WAS NOT OCCUPIED, HOWEVER, A FACT THAT HIS FAMILY </p><p>ATTRIBUTED TO LUCK AND PERHAPS A REPUTATION FOR GOOD </p><p>EMPLOYEE RELATIONS, BUT ADMITTED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW </p><p>HOW THEY ESCAPED THE SQUATTERS.  THE UNEQUIVOCAL </p><p>CONSENSUS OF EVERYONE WITH WHOM WE SPOKE WAS THAT THE </p><p>FARM INVASIONS WERE NOT ABOUT LAND REFORM AT ALL, BUT A </p><p>MERE PRETEXT FOR MOVING WAR VETERANS AND ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTERS INTO THE RURAL AREAS TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE </p><p>INTO SUPPORTING THE RULING PARTY DURING THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.

(C) ONE TOBACCO FARMER RECOUNTED HOW HE HAD BEEN </p><p>INVADED AND EVICTED OFF HIS FARM ON THREE SEPARATE </p><p>OCCASIONS BY WAR VETS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF ANOTHER </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  03078  04 OF 04  071609Z </p><p>WARLORD, "JESUS TWO."  DURING THESE SESSIONS, HE WAS </p><p>BEATEN AND DEMEANED.  COMMERCIAL FARMERS NATIONALLY HAVE </p><p>ESTABLISHED A RADIO NET ON WHICH THEY PROVIDE EMERGENCY </p><p>INFORMATION ON OCCUPATIONS AND A NIGHTLY SITUATION </p><p>REPORT.  THE BANKET FARMERS SAID THEIR NET ALONE HAS 200 </p><p>CALL SIGNS.  DURING SEVERAL OCCUPATIONS IN THE AREA, THE </p><p>BESIEGED FARMER WOULD RADIO FOR HELP AND OTHER FARMERS </p><p>CALLED FOR POLICE HELP AND THEN DROVE TO THE LOCATION TO </p><p>MONITOR THE SITUATION AS IT DEVELOPED.  THE ASSISTING </p><p>FARMERS SAID THEY ALWAYS CAME UNARMED AND GENERALLY </p><p>REFRAINED FROM DIRECT INVOLVEMENT, AS THE 100 TO 200 WAR </p><p>VETS WHO COME OUTNUMBER THEM.  ONE OF THE INVADED </p><p>FARMERS TOLD US MOST OF THE OCCUPIERS WERE COMMUNAL FARM </p><p>WORKERS WHO WERE FORCED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INVASIONS </p><p>OUT OF FEAR OF REPRISAL AGAINST THEM.  HE HELD NO ILL </p><p>WILL AGAINST THEM, HE SAID.  THE OCCUPIERS MAKE THEIR </p><p>DEMANDS KNOWN, NEGOTIATE THEIR PRESENCE ON THE LAND </p><p>(I.E., WHAT RATIONS THE FARMER WILL PROVIDE) AND THEN </p><p>RETREAT TO A SECTION OF THE FARM.  THE SUBSEQUENT </p><p>VIOLENCE THAT OCCURS IS ORGANIZED BY A HAND-FULL OF </p><p>"EXCITABLE YOUTH" OR ASPIRING WARLORDS, BUT NOT GENUINE </p><p>WAR VETS.  THE WAR VETS ARE FACTION-RIDDEN, WITH STRONG </p><p>ETHNIC AND ZANU/ZAPU TENSIONS ACCOUNTING FOR THE LACK OF </p><p>ANY CONSISTENT STRATEGY OR STABILITY ON THE OCCUPIED </p><p>FARMS, THE FARMERS ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>THE ECONOMIC FUTURE </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE FARMERS AND BUSINESS PEOPLE DESCRIBED THE </p><p>FINANCIAL LOSSES THEY WERE SUFFERING AS A RESULT OF THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03078  04 OF 04  071609Z </p><p>FARM INVASIONS AND GOVERNMENT PLANS TO ACQUIRE 804 </p><p>PRODUCTIVE FARMS.  THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS URGED THE U.S. </p><p>TO CONSIDER AN ECONOMIC "RECOVERY PLAN" FOR FARMERS </p><p>AFTER THE ELECTION, INCLUDING INTEREST-FREE, OFFSHORE </p><p>LOANS.  AMBASSADOR MCDONALD EXPLAINED THAT SUCH AN </p><p>ARRANGEMENT WOULD NOT HAPPEN, BUT STRESSED THAT WITHIN </p><p>OUR FINANCIAL MEANS THE USG WANTED TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>SUPPORT LAND REFORM. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) AMBASSADOR MCDONALD USED THIS TRIP TO REITERATE </p><p>OUR STRONG CONDEMNATION OF THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND TO </p><p>INFORM THESE ZIMBABWEANS OF OUR SUPPORT FOR DOMESTIC AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MONITORING EFFORTS.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE </p><p>KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT THESE GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS WERE OCCURRING AND HAVE REPORTED THEM, IT IS </p><p>SHOCKING TO HEAR IT FROM THESE PERSONAL TESTIMONIALS. </p><p>IT IS HEARTENING TO KNOW THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN </p><p>VICTIMIZED ARE STILL OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ZIMBABWE\'S FUTURE </p><p>AND INTEND TO STAY.  THE VISIT WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED </p><p>SHORING UP THOSE WE MET AND IS LIKELY TO HAVE THE DUAL </p><p>EFFECT OF APPRISING THE GENERAL ELECTORATE, AS WELL AS </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY </p><p>IS AWARE OF THE STATE-ORCHESTRATED VIOLENCE IN THE </p><p>COUNTRYSIDE.  THE GENERAL SENSE WE GOT WAS THAT DESPITE </p><p>THE PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE THE OPPOSITION REMAINS POISED </p><p>TO TAKE A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF SEATS.  TO DATE, WE HAVE </p><p>CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED AROUND 30 SEATS.  THAT NUMBER </p><p>MAY NEED TO BE REVISED UPWARDS, WITH INDICATIONS THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03078  04 OF 04  071609Z </p><p>MDC COULD GET AS MANY AS 45 TO 55 SEATS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) THERE REMAINS A GREAT CONCERN THAT THE RULING </p><p>PARTY WILL RIG THE VOTE COUNT TO PREVENT ANY MDC </p><p>MAJORITY FROM SITTING IN THE PARLIAMENT.  IF THAT </p><p>HAPPENS, THE BIGGEST THREAT TO PEACE IN THE COUNTRY WILL </p><p>BE THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD WHEN THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>OPPOSITION ARE LIKELY TO DISPUTE THE RESULTS.  NO ONE </p><p>CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THAT POINT, </p><p>BUT THE MILITARY HAS TWICE DISTANCED ITSELF FROM ANY </p><p>PERCEPTION THAT IT HAS AN INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF THE </p><p>ELECTION.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
