<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 001686 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA ASSISTANT SECRETARY BURNS AND S/CT COFER BLACK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FOLLOW UP DEMARCHES TO HOST GOVERNMENTS ON IRAQI </p><p>INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 71552 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  Jordan is a unique case in a number of ways.  Our </p><p>close relationship at the most senior levels enables us to </p><p>maintain a candid and forthright exchange on this specific </p><p>subject -- the expulsion of Iraqi intelligence officers. </p><p>ORCA has and continues to work closely on this matter.  GID </p><p>is closely monitoring IIS agents and emphasized today that </p><p>they have intensified that effort. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  In addition, Ambassador raised this subject in </p><p>his meeting today (March 19) with the King, GID Director </p><p>Kheir, and ORCA representatives.  They told the Ambassador </p><p>that their concerns for what IIS agents might do against both </p><p>Jordanian and American targets was parallel to ours.  They </p><p>added, however, that they have no knowledge of IIS plans to </p><p>conduct retaliatory actions against the U.S. Embassy or </p><p>American personnel in Jordan.  Nevertheless, they had greatly </p><p>expanded their surveillance and were prepared to take </p><p>whatever action might be required in the face of specific </p><p>activities or intelligence.  They remain, however, deeply </p><p>concerned about the international attention given to the </p><p>expulsion of IIS agents by many countries around the world at </p><p>U.S. request.  Such publicity, coupled with the general </p><p>public hostility to U.S. military actions against Iraq, were </p><p>cause for a careful and well-thought plan to deal with IIS </p><p>agents.  They were firmly committed to taking action at the </p><p>right time and that right time is related to the commencement </p><p>of hostilities. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  COMMENT:  The King and GID understand completely </p><p>our concern and have taken expanded measures to protect us </p><p>and enhance their own security.  They are at this point in </p><p>time staying away from expulsions.  In their opinion, such </p><p>actions would signal too early and too clearly either to Iraq </p><p>or their own citizens that they are abetting U.S. military </p><p>actions against Iraq.  We fully expect that they will indeed </p><p>move against IIS agents as necessary in the next few days. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
