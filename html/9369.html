<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004306 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM/A, PRMA/ANE AND NEA/NGA </p><p>INS FOR HQSTA AND HQRIC </p><p>ROME, ATHENS FOR BCIS </p><p>CPA BAGHDAD FOR WYLLIE AND LAPENN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  Some Kurds on Jordan\'s Border Return to Iraq; </p><p>Restored UNHCR Iraq Operations -- Including Resettlement -- </p><p>Required to Convince the Rest </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) Amman 4001 </p><p>      B) Cheyne/Rusch July 10 e-mail </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) This is a joint report from Amman and Cairo </p><p>refcoords and contains an action request in para 8. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Summary and Action Request:  Amman and Cairo </p><p>refcoords traveled to the Jordanian-Iraqi border July 8 to </p><p>meet with Iranian Kurds who seek resettlement in a third </p><p>country.  UNHCR reported that an additional 79 Iranian Kurds </p><p>have left no-man\'s land (NML) for northern Iraq, with </p><p>another five Kurdish families rumored to have left NML for </p><p>Iran.  The number of Kurds in NML is now less than 1,000. </p><p>However, the Kurds who returned to northern Iraq reported </p><p>that UNHCR is unable to provide protection or any form of </p><p>assistance to refugees in the north, discouraging others </p><p>from following them.  The Kurds\' leadership therefore </p><p>continues to insist that they will not leave NML except for </p><p>resettlement in a third country.  Full-scale resumption of </p><p>UNHCR activities in Iraq -- beginning in the north -- </p><p>appears to be the only way to resolve the lingering problem </p><p>at NML. Department\'s guidance on possible DHS resettlement </p><p>processing in northern Iraq is requested.  End summary and </p><p>action request. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Amman- and Cairo-based regional refcoords made a </p><p>joint trip to the Jordanian-Iraqi border on July 8 to meet </p><p>with Iranian Kurds who seek resettlement in a third country. </p><p>As reported ref a, a core group of 1,000 Iranian Kurds from </p><p>Iraq\'s Al Tash refugee camp have been in no-man\'s land (NML) </p><p>at the Iraqi-Jordanian border since April 12, seeking </p><p>temporary asylum in Jordan and resettlement in a third </p><p>country.  UNHCR (correctly, in our opinion) refuses to </p><p>conduct resettlement screening in NML, fearing it would </p><p>create a pull factor for disgruntled refugees and Iraqi </p><p>nationals from throughout Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) During their July 8 meeting, refcoords repeated </p><p>previous assurances that the US would consider the Iranian </p><p>Kurds for resettlement if they would return to Iraq.  The </p><p>Kurds\' leadership flatly rejected even a temporary return to </p><p>Iraq.  Northern Iraq is not their land, the Kurds said, and </p><p>their political affiliations make them vulnerable to cross- </p><p>border threats from Iranian security agents.  The Iran-Iraq </p><p>border is porous, they argued, and coalition forces are </p><p>unable to protect Kurdish political activists from Iranian </p><p>intelligence agents who have a known record of assassinating </p><p>opponents abroad.  The group at NML claims to be composed </p><p>entirely of political activists, with five different </p><p>political movements represented:  the Democratic Party of </p><p>Kurdistan of Iran (DPKI), the Communist Party (Kommula), the </p><p>Constitutionalist Movements, the Mujahadeen-e-Khalq (MEK) </p><p>and Khabat.  The Kurds also claimed that Jalal Talabani and </p><p>the PUK, who have been encouraging the Al Tash Kurds to </p><p>resettle in northern Iraq, are known to have good relations </p><p>with Iran and therefore are not to be trusted. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The Kurds confirmed UNHCR\'s report that 79 </p><p>individuals had left NML for northern Iraq (the village of </p><p>Kallar, near Sulaimaniyah) but denied reports that 5 Kurdish </p><p>families had left NML for Iran.  (UNHCR separately confirmed </p><p>that the number of Kurds in NML is now less than 1,000 but </p><p>said it is unable to provide more precise figures, as it has </p><p>never implemented a camp registration system in NML.) </p><p>According to the NML camp leadership, the Kurds who returned </p><p>to northern Iraq reported that UNHCR is unable to provide </p><p>protection or any form of assistance to refugees in the </p><p>north and have discouraged others from following them. </p><p>Although the KDP and PUK have made good on their promises of </p><p>providing land for the Al Tash Kurds, they cannot provide </p><p>food or humanitarian assistance to the group and UNHCR, the </p><p>Kurds noted bitterly, also is unable to provide any </p><p>assistance.  The camp committee asked refcoords how UNHCR </p><p>and the US could possibly advocate the Kurds\' return to Iraq </p><p>under these circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>6.  In the meantime, protection conditions in the NML camp </p><p>continue to deteriorate.  With hundreds of trucks queued at </p><p>the border crossing every day, UNHCR reports that the NML </p><p>refugees are increasingly engaged in "business," selling </p><p>food and commodities to the truckers waiting to cross the </p><p>borders.  Refugee children are acting as runners for the </p><p>business, darting in and out of traffic all day.  A child </p><p>was hit by a car during the week of June 30 and medevaced to </p><p>Amman with a serious head injury.  Nevertheless, the </p><p>accident did not sway the camp committee\'s position in the </p><p>least. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment:  From our perspective, a full-scale </p><p>resumption of UNHCR activities in Iraq -- beginning in the </p><p>north -- is the only way to resolve the lingering problem at </p><p>NML.  If UNHCR is able to reestablish basic services and </p><p>then move quickly to start resettlement processing, the NML </p><p>Kurds most likely will return voluntarily to northern Iraq. </p><p>However, it is far from certain that UNHCR has agreed upon </p><p>this approach, as there continues to be differences of </p><p>opinion between UNHCR personnel in Geneva, Amman and </p><p>Baghdad.  PRM A/S Dewey\'s July 15-21 visit to the region </p><p>hopefully will provide an opportunity to develop a common </p><p>approach to this problem. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Action Request:  In the meantime, UNHCR/Jordan </p><p>seeks assurances from resettlement countries that they will </p><p>be able to conduct resettlement processing in northern Iraq. </p><p>As requested ref b, refcoords seek guidance on:  whether CPA </p><p>Baghdad and BCIS would consider refugee resettlement </p><p>processing in northern Iraq; and what information and/or </p><p>arrangements BCIS would require to commit to resettlement </p><p>processing in northern Iraq.  We also need to consider which </p><p>Overseas Processing Entity (OPE) -- Istanbul or Amman -- </p><p>would be best equipped to work in northern Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) CPA Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
