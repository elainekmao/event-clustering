<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 GUATEMALA 000933 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SNAR, OVIP, KIPR, PHUM, ELAB, MARR, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND FOREIGN MINISTER DISCUSS </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT AND BILATERAL ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  The Ambassador and Foreign Minister </p><p>Gutierrez met on April 3 to discuss the upcoming visit of the </p><p>Central American presidents to Washington to meet with </p><p>President Bush on CAFTA.  The Ambassador carried out </p><p>demarches on Cuba and Iraq (septels), mentioned upcoming </p><p>visits of USG officials to discuss GSP labor concerns and </p><p>Article 98 Agreement, asked for expedited signing of the new </p><p>IPR law and discussed progress in setting up CICIACS. </p><p>Foreign Minister Gutierrez welcomed the information on the </p><p>Presidential meeting.  He informed us of problems in the </p><p>DECAM (GOG arms and munitions regulatory agency), and </p><p>remedial actions being taken by the GOG to avoid arms being </p><p>held legally by drug-traffickers.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>The April 10 Presidential Meeting </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador met with Foreign Minister Edgar </p><p>Gutierrez at the Foreign Ministry on April 3 to discuss the </p><p>upcoming meeting of the Central American Presidents with </p><p>President Bush.  He said the Presidential meeting reflects </p><p>something much bigger than the sum of our individual </p><p>bilateral issues, but rather the future of the entire </p><p>bilateral relationship and regional integration.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that President Bush would like to focus the </p><p>meeting on free trade (CAFTA), and hoped that the Central </p><p>American presidents would take advantage of this opportunity </p><p>to keep attention focused on that theme.  If, as apparently </p><p>had been agreed in Roatan, the Presidents were going to </p><p>address such subjects as regional integration, agriculture </p><p>and arms reduction, it would be useful to relate them to </p><p>CAFTA and to keep the remarks short and conversational, not </p><p>set-piece speeches.  Gutierrez said, "don\'t worry about us -- </p><p>will keep it short." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The Ambassador noted that other bilateral themes, </p><p>including counter-narcotics cooperation, would be a topic for </p><p>discussion at the April 11 breakfast between President </p><p>Portillo and WHA Acting A/S Struble.  However, the meeting </p><p>with President Bush would not be an appropriate venue for a </p><p>debate on certification.  The Ambassador commented that WHA </p><p>A/S Struble would be holding a tele-briefing for the </p><p>Guatemalan press on April 8 to draw attention to recent </p><p>improvements in Guatemala\'s counter-narcotics cooperation. </p><p>We believe that this will generate a positive climate for the </p><p>Presidential meeting.  The Ambassador noted, however, that </p><p>the USG decision to decertify Guatemala as a cooperating </p><p>partner in the war on drugs would not be reviewed prior to </p><p>the April 10 meeting, and the GOG should not expect action on </p><p>this front prior to the summit.  Gutierrez thanked us for the </p><p>upcoming press briefing by WHA A/S Struble, which he thought </p><p>would be useful for setting a positive tone.  He did not push </p><p>back on our statement that Guatemala would not be recertified </p><p>before the April 10 meeting, and appeared satisfied that the </p><p>USG was pleased with continuing progress and would say so in </p><p>the April 8 press briefing.  He welcomed the April 11 </p><p>breakfast between Portillo and A/S Struble. </p><p> </p><p>Torture of Drug Suspects </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador told Gutierrez that we were concerned </p><p>that state agents may have used torture and illegal detention </p><p>to carry out a drug seizure in Zacapa in March (septels). </p><p>Furthermore, it appears they planted drugs on three suspects </p><p>in order to incriminate them.  The Ambassador said he has </p><p>already talked to the President, the Ministers of Defense and </p><p>Government and the PNC Director about this matter, and </p><p>received their assurances that it would not happen again. </p><p>The Ambassador told Gutierrez that the GOG needed to ensure </p><p>that the drug war is pursued solely by means that are legal </p><p>and that do not violate human rights.  Actions outside the </p><p>law will hurt, not help, re-certification. </p><p> </p><p>Counter-Narcotics Maritime Agreement </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>5. (C) Prior to the discussion of the Struble </p><p>tele-conference, Gutierrez gave the Ambassador a MFA legal </p><p>opinion on our proposed CN Maritime Agreement.  Gutierrez </p><p>said the GOG had gotten hung up for some time on the </p><p>sovereignty issue, but had come up with what he hoped we </p><p>would regard as a creative solution.  We will report this </p><p>issue septel once we have analyzed the GOG proposal. </p><p> </p><p>Article 98 Agreement </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>6. (C) The Ambassador advised Gutierrez of the April 10-11 </p><p>visit to Guatemala of Ambassador Marisa Lino and a team of </p><p>USG negotiators to discuss signing an Article 98 Agreement. </p><p>He asked that the GOG assign the highest level negotiators to </p><p>ensure that the discussions succeed.  Gutierrez noted that he </p><p>had already given instructions for the head of the MFA\'s </p><p>legal department to meet with the USG delegation, and </p><p>lamented that the senior officials who could initial an </p><p>agreement would all be out of the country those dates. </p><p>Gutierrez believes that, despite the absence from the country </p><p>of the senior MFA officials, the discussions of an Article 98 </p><p>Agreement can make progress. </p><p> </p><p>IPR Law </p><p>------- </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador expressed appreciation for the recent </p><p>passage of improved IPR legislation, and said that it was </p><p>important that the law be signed by President Portillo before </p><p>April 8 in order for it to be taken into consideration in our </p><p>Special 301 Review.  The Foreign Minister took note and </p><p>promised to advise us. </p><p> </p><p>GSP Review </p><p>---------- </p><p>8. (C) The Ambassador commented that USTR would decide on </p><p>April 15 whether to accept a GSP petition filed against </p><p>Guatemala, based in large part on violence against labor </p><p>leaders.  The Ambassador noted the April 4 visit of Assistant </p><p>USTR for Labor William Clatanoff and Department of State </p><p>Director of International Labor Affairs George White would </p><p>give the GOG an opportunity to hear USG concerns and provide </p><p>a GOG response.  Gutierrez said that the GOG takes this issue </p><p>seriously, and he had asked Vice Minister Aguilera to </p><p>represent him in meetings with the senior USG visitors, as </p><p>Gutierrez would be in Belize that day. </p><p> </p><p>CICIACS </p><p>------- </p><p>9. (C) In early April, the GOG sent senior Guatemalan </p><p>diplomat Maritza Ruiz de Vielmann to Washington and New York </p><p>to discuss the modalities for OAS and UN participation in the </p><p>commission being established to investigate threats against </p><p>human rights workers (CICIACS).  Specifically, Ruiz was to </p><p>explore UN willingness to have the CICIACS constituted as an </p><p>international mission under UN auspices, like MINUGUA, as </p><p>this was what the Human Rights Ombudsman and the NGO </p><p>community were now demanding.  Gutierrez doubted that the UN </p><p>would want to be responsible for a second international </p><p>mission, but wanted to explore the option as a gesture of </p><p>good faith.  The Ambassador commented that we viewed recent </p><p>GOG flexibility on this matter (together with the GOG </p><p>dropping the idea of CICIACS reporting to the GOG Peace </p><p>Secretariat, to which the Ombudsman objected) as a positive </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>sign, as it had convinced the human rights NGO community that </p><p>the GOG would not obstruct efforts to establish a credible </p><p>investigatory commission.  Gutierrez commented that he had </p><p>placed Ambassador Ruiz de Vielmann in charge of this effort </p><p>to demonstrate the seriousness the GOG assigns to </p><p>establishing a credible mechanism to investigate clandestine </p><p>groups. </p><p> </p><p>DECAM </p><p>----- </p><p>10. (C) Foreign Minister Gutierrez told the Ambassador that </p><p>President Portillo had instructed him to inform us that the </p><p>GOG was investigating "serious abuses" by the DECAM (the </p><p>GOG\'s arms and ammunition regulatory agency belonging to the </p><p>Ministry of Defense).  According to Gutierrez, the GOG found </p><p>out that the DECAM has been issuing assault rifle permits to </p><p>the bodyguards of the major narco-traffickers.  The GOG has </p><p>temporarily invalidated all fire-arms licenses, and will </p><p>carefully review all requests for restoring permits in an </p><p>attempt to more carefully control the issuance of such </p><p>licenses.  Gutierrez promised to keep us informed of progress </p><p>(Note:  Minister of Defense Moran mentioned the same charge </p><p>against the DECAM earlier in the week, and similarly noted </p><p>that the GOG is in the process of cleaning it up. End note). </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>11. (C) The Guatemalans view the upcoming meeting with </p><p>President Bush as very important for generating a modicum of </p><p>domestic credibility for Portillo\'s battered presidency. </p><p>Appearances on April 10 will be as important to them as </p><p>substance.  With the national election campaign only five </p><p>weeks away from officially starting, the perception that the </p><p>U.S. views the Portillo administration negatively has </p><p>implications for his party, the FRG.  This explains why, in </p><p>April 5-6 press coverage, Portillo has stated he will raise </p><p>with the President the statements made by former A/S Reich </p><p>(GOG official corruption) and decertification.  Our </p><p>assessment, however, is that Portillo will be statesman-like </p><p>at the presidential meeting, and will try to convey the </p><p>impression that, despite our doubts about his government\'s </p><p>counter-narcotics cooperation, he is someone we can work with. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
