CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  SADDAM HAS BLINKED:  HOSTILE </p><p>REFERENCES TO KUWAIT HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE </p><p>MEDIA AND IRAQ WILL ATTEND A MEETING WITH </p><p>SENIOR KUWAITI OFFICIALS IN JEDDAH.  BUT </p><p>ANTI-KUWAITI SENTIMENT CONTINUES STRONG HERE </p><p>AT ALL SOCIAL LEVELS, DRIVEN BY JEALOUSY, </p><p>BITTERNESS AND CONTEMPT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>WHAT DISPUTE? </p><p> </p><p>3.  AS FAR AS IRAQ\'S GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED MEDIA </p><p>JULY 26 ARE CONCERNED, THE DISPUTE WITH KUWAIT </p><p>IS A "SUMMER CLOUD."  GONE ARE THE HEADLINES </p><p>OUTLINING KUWAITI MISBEHAVIOUR, GONE ARE THE </p><p>AD HOMINEM ATTACKS ON KUWAIT FONMIN SABAH, </p><p>GONE ARE THE EDITORIALS OUTLINING IRAQ\'S CASE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  INSTEAD, THE MEDIA FOCUS IS BACK ON DOMESTIC </p><p>AFFAIRS (THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION) AND THEY </p><p>HIGHLIGHT CONTINUING DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY: </p><p> </p><p>- SADDAM RECEIVING A PHONE CALL FROM MUBARAK. </p><p>(BUT MUBARAK IS NOT GIVEN CREDIT FOR MEDIATING </p><p>AND THERE IS NO/NO MENTION OF THE UPCOMING </p><p>KUWAIT-IRAQI MEETING IN JEDDAH). </p><p> </p><p>- SADDAM\'S ENVOYS DELIVERING THEIR MESSAGES IN </p><p>THE GULF AND MAGREB. </p><p> </p><p>- SADDAM MEETING WITH ARAB LEAGUE SYG KLIBI TO </p><p>DISCUSS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGION AND </p><p>ARAB ARENA.  (ALTHOUGH A PHOTOGRAPH OF KLIBI </p><p>WITH SADDAM MADE THE FRONT PAGES, THE MEDIA </p><p>(AND THE GOI) DOWNPLAYED HIS VISIT.  HE WAS </p><p>SEEN OFF AT THE AIRPORT BY A MERE MFA UNDER </p><p>SECRETARY.  KLIBI PROVES NOT TO BE A </p><p>MAHMUD RIAD, BUT THEN TUNISIA IS NOT EGYPT). </p><p> </p><p>- SADDAM "SUMMONING" (VICE THE USUAL IRAQI </p><p>WORD "RECEIVING") THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR, </p><p>FEATURED IN ALL THE MEDIA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  SIGNIFICANTLY, THE IRAQI MEDIA HAVE DROPPED </p><p>MENTION OF THE US/UAE JOINT EXERCISES.  THE </p><p>ARMY\'S DAILY "AL-QADISSIYAH" GIVES FRONT PAGE </p><p>COVERAGE TO JORDANIAN PRESS REPORTS LAUDING </p><p>SADDAM\'S IDEA FOR ESTABLISHING AN ARAB FUND </p><p>(WHICH IS POPULAR IN JORDAN, EGYPT AND YEMEN) </p><p>AND CONDEMNING THE US NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE GULF. </p><p>EDITORIALS AND COMMENTARIES RETURN TO EARLIER </p><p>THEMES:  THE DANGER OF SOVIET JEWISH IMMIGRATION </p><p>TO ISRAEL; THE NEED FOR ARAB UNITY; THE USG\'S </p><p>DESIRE FOR HEGEMONY IN THE GULF. </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ BLINKED </p><p> </p><p>6.  THAT SADDAM ACCEPTED MUBARAK\'S MEDIATION </p><p>AND AGREED TO A MEETING OF OFFICIALS IN JEDDAH </p><p>REINFORCES OUR VIEW THAT THE CENTRAL ISSUE FOR </p><p>IRAQ IS REVENUE, NOT THE BORDER.  EVEN BEFORE </p><p>THE OPEC MEETING BEGAN, THE GOI\'S SABER- </p><p>RATTLING HAD BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE SHARP </p><p>RISE IN OIL PRICES.  THEN AT ITS JULY 25 </p><p>SESSION, OPEC REPORTEDLY CAME TOWARD THE IRAQI </p><p>POSITION, AGREEING TO A MINIMUM PRICE OF USD </p><p>20 PER BARREL.  WE EXPECT THE GOI TO BE </p><p>TOUGH DURING THE OPEC MEETING TODAY (JULY 26) </p><p>AND TO STAND OUT FOR USD 25.  BUT HAVING RAISED </p><p>KUWAITI APPREHENSIONS SO HIGH BY CRUDE TACTICS, </p><p>THE GOI MAY HOLD OUT FOR OTHER CONCESSIONS; </p><p>E.G., OPENING OF THE DIRECT AIR ROUTE TO </p><p>KUWAIT. </p><p> </p><p>7.  IRAQ MIGHT ALSO PRESS FOR FORGIVENESS OF </p><p>WAR DEBTS.  THE IRAQIS HAVE TOLD US THAT THE </p><p>GOK (BUT NOT THE SAG) CARRY THESE DEBTS ON THE </p><p>BOOKS THEY SHOW TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  IN FACT, WE HAVE FROM A </p><p>WESTERN EMBASSY, TWO SEPARATE SENIOR SAUDI </p><p>SOURCES SAYING KUWAIT RECENTLY TRIED TO </p><p>COLLECT USD TWO BILLION FROM IRAQ, EVEN </p><p>GIVING IRAQ A JULY 31 DEADLINE.  THIS SURPRISING </p><p>STORY, SHOULD IT PROVE TRUE, WOULD SHED </p><p>CONSIDERABLE LIGHT ON THE IRAQI CONCLUSION </p><p>THAT KUWAIT IS NOT AS SYMPATHETIC TO IRAQI </p><p>FINANCIAL STRAITS AS IT SHOULD BE. </p><p> </p><p>KUWAIT BLINKED, TOO </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE IRAQIS WILL CONCLUDE THAT THE KUWAITIS </p><p>HAVE BLINKED TOO, SINCE ACCORDING TO BBC REPORTS </p><p>TODAY, KUWAIT HAS AGREED NOT/NOT TO ASK FOR </p><p>HIGHER PRODUCTION QUOTAS DURING THE LAST QUARTER </p><p>OF 1990. </p><p> </p><p>EGYPTIAN MEDIATION CONTINUES </p><p> </p><p>9.  EGYPTIAN EMBASSY CONFIDED TO US JULY 26 </p><p>THAT MUBARAK\'S ADVISOR USAMA AL-BAZ HAS </p><p>ARRIVED IN BAGHDAD.  IRAQI MEDIA ANNOUNCED </p><p>THAT HE MET WITH SADDAM JULY 26. </p><p> </p><p>DEEP ANTI-KUWAITI SENTIMENT </p><p> </p><p>10.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE THE DEPTH OF </p><p>ANTI-KUWAITI SENTIMENT IN IRAQ.  THIS IS THE </p><p>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BACKDROP TO CURRENT </p><p>TENSIONS.  THE DISLIKE IS OLD AND DEEP -- NOT </p><p>SOMETHING TRUMPED UP BY THE MEDIA FOR THE </p><p>OCCASION.  EVEN OUR MOST SOPHISTICATED IRAQI </p><p>COLLEAGUES AND CONTACTS BECOME NEANDERTHAL ON </p><p>THE ISSUE OF KUWAITIS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE KUWAITIS WHO COME TO IRAQ WITH POCKETS </p><p>FULL OF IRAQI DINARS (PURCHASED AT THE BLACK </p><p>MARKET RATE WHICH IS LESS THAN ONE-TENTH OF THE </p><p>OFFICIAL RATE) AND WHICH THEY OSTENTATIOUSLY </p><p>SPEND, ARE NOT THE EDUCATED MIDDLE CLASSES -- </p><p>THEY GO TO EUROPE.  IRAQ GETS THE EQUIVALENT OF </p><p>"PO   WHITE TRASH", THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASSES, </p><p>WHO CAN BE SEEN IN BASRA IN THEIR SCORES ON </p><p>A FRIDAY, AND IN THE NORTHERN SUMMER RESORTS, </p><p>OFTEN DRUNK, SOMETIMES DISORDERLY, AND OFTEN </p><p>GAMBLING IN THE OTHERWISE EMPTY CASINOS.  THEY </p><p>ALSO COME TO BAGHDAD IN DROVES, PROVIDING THE </p><p>CLIENTELE FOR CHEAP NIGHTCLUBS AND CALL GIRLS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  IRAQIS DEEPLY FEEL THAT THE KUWAITIS ARE </p><p>IMMENSELY STINGY SHYLOCKS, LIVING HIGH WHILE </p><p>IRAQ, WHICH MADE SUCH TERRIBLE SACRIFICES </p><p>DURING THE WAR, IT STILL SUFFERING.  INDEED, </p><p>WHEN SADDAM MADE THAT POINT TO THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>(BAGHDAD 4237), TWO OF HIS STAFFERS (WHO BOTH, </p><p>WE CAN SAFELY ASSUME, LOST RELATIVES IN THE </p><p>WAR) BURST INTO TEARS.  AND AS A MEASURE OF </p><p>JUST HOW MUCH IRAQIS DISLIKE THE KUWAITIS, </p><p>TWO OTHER IRAQIS ON THAT DAY VOLUNTEERED TO </p><p>US THEIR DISLIKE.  ONE COMPLAINED HIS SISTER </p><p>COULD NOT WALK ALONE IN CENTRAL BAGHDAD </p><p>ANY MORE BECAUSE OF HARRASSMENT FROM KUWAITIS, </p><p>WHILE A SUCCESSFUL IRAQI TRADER COMPLAINED </p><p>BITTERLY ABOUT THE KUWAITI OBSESSION WITH </p><p>MONEY. </p><p> </p><p>13.  IRAQI ATTITUDES TO KUWAITIS CONTRAST </p><p>SHARPLY WITH THEIR ATTITUDE TO MOST OTHER ARABS. </p><p>NO MATTER HOW BAD RELATIONS BECOME WITH, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE JORDAN, THERE IS ALWAYS A FELLOW </p><p>FEELING TOWARDS EAST JORDANIANS, A FEELING </p><p>ABSENT TOWARD KUWAITIS. </p><p> </p><p>ARENS\' PROPAGANDA SUCCESSFUL </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE ISRAELI PRESS AND DEFMIN ARENS HAVE </p><p>SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THE IRAQIS BELIEVE THAT </p><p>ARENS WAS SUMMONED TO WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS </p><p>THE GULF.  CERTAINLY SADDAM EXPRESSED THIS </p><p>VIEW IN HIS JULY 25 MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR </p><p>AND WE INVITE DEPARTMENT\'S ATTENTION TO ARENS\' </p><p>TV INTERVIEW JULY 25 (FBIS TA2507201890) IN </p><p>WHICH HE REFERS TO HIS CONVERSATION WITH </p><p>DEFENSE SECRETARY CHENEY ON THE GULF. </p><p>MILITARY ACTIVITY </p><p> </p><p>15.  JULY 26 IS THE FIRST DAY FOR A WEEK WHEN </p><p>WE HAVE NOT/NOT SEEN RAILWAY CARS LOADED WITH </p><p>MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN THE MARSHALLING YARDS </p><p>IN MANSUR.  THIS COULD MEAN THAT ALL THE </p><p>EQUIPMENT THE GOI FORCES ON THE BORDER NEED IS </p><p>ALREADY IN PLACE, OR THAT NO NEW FORCES ARE </p><p>BEING SENT SOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>GLASPIE </p><p>UNQUOTE </p><p> </p><p>EAGLEBURGER </p><p></p></div>
