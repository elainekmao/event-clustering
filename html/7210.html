<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002254 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PBTS, PHSA, GR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKS: RESOLUTION ON AEGEAN CLAIMS "NOT PRODUCTIVE" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Pol-Mil Counselor Stuart Brown.  Reasons </p><p>1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary.  MFA\'s DDG for Maritime and Aviation </p><p>Affairs, Vakur Gokdenizler, convoked pol-mil counselor to </p><p>tell us that Congress\' adoption of House Concurrent </p><p>Resolution 87 on Aegean claims would be a "symbol of </p><p>deteriorating U.S.-Turkish relations."  He asked that the USG </p><p>do what it could to avoid that, and foresaw that the </p><p>resolution could further strain Turkey\'s relationship with </p><p>the EU and Greece.  Post undertook to make Turkey\'s </p><p>displeasure with the resolution known to the Department. </p><p>Text of the MFA\'s nonpaper on the subject is at para 5.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On April 7, MFA DDG for Maritime and Aviation Affairs </p><p>Vakur Gokdenizler convoked pol-mil counselor to express </p><p>concern regarding House Concurrent Resolution 87.  The </p><p>resolution concerns Aegean claims, mainly regarding the </p><p>Imia/Kardak islets.  Congressman Robert Andrews (D-NJ) is the </p><p>sponsor, with Congressmen James McGovern (D-MA) and Michael </p><p>Bilirakis (R-FL) cosponsoring.  Gokdenizler said that the </p><p>resolution, which Con. Andrews submitted to the House </p><p>Committee on International Relations on March 11, was </p><p>identical to one submitted in 2001. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Mentioning that the GOT saw some "factual errors" in </p><p>the resolution\'s text, Gokdenizler said that the MFA could </p><p>"always get into the details of Aegean problems."  At this </p><p>time, however, he thought that there was a more important </p><p>"political argument" for the US to avoid taking a stand on </p><p>Aegean issues.  Gokdenizler pointed out that Cyprus and </p><p>Aegean issues are "going through a bottleneck in 2004" as the </p><p>EU, Greece, and Cyprus attempt to link Turkish EU membership </p><p>to solutions in both areas.  Asking that the US not aggravate </p><p>either issue, he noted that resolutions like this seem to </p><p>come at "critical times."  He urged us not to let this </p><p>resolution become a "symbol of deteriorating Turkish-U.S. </p><p>relations."  Gokdenizler said the Turkish Embassy in </p><p>Washington was also working the problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Pol-mil counselor replied that Secretary Powell\'s </p><p>April 2 visit had gone a long way toward re-strengthening </p><p>bilateral ties, but that much work remained.  He undertook to </p><p>make the GOT\'s concern regarding the resolution known to the </p><p>Department. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Following is the text of the nonpaper Gokdenizler </p><p>presented: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Hon. Robert Andrew (D-NJ), Hon. McGovern (D-MA) and Hon. </p><p>Bilirakis (R-FL) prepared a concurrent resolution on 11 March </p><p>2003, entitled "Expressing the Sense of Congress regarding </p><p>Turkey\'s claims of sovereignty over islands and islets in the </p><p>Aegean Sea."  The draft resolution was referred to the </p><p>Committee on International relations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- This is not the first draft of its kind.  The Committee </p><p>received a similar one on 4 April 2001 but it did not take </p><p>any action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The content of the draft is unacceptable.  It contains </p><p>one-sided, biased, prejudiced arguments.  It jumps into hasty </p><p>conclusions without any detailed legal basis about the status </p><p>of the Aegean island, islets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- It also contradicts the declared US position on the Aegean </p><p>issues.  The US has exerted important efforts in the past for </p><p>the settlement of these issues and has displayed a balanced </p><p>and evenhanded approach (madrid agreement, bilateral talks, </p><p>etc.)  The US therefore is well aware of the complex and </p><p>interrelated nature of these issues than any other country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Despite these facts, the draft, if accepted, would mean a </p><p>fundamental change in the US position which would have </p><p>negative repercussions on the Turkish-US relations at this </p><p>critical time.  The timing of this renewed attempt therefore </p><p>raises concerns about its real motive as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The draft is also unhelpful and counter productive at a </p><p>time when the Aegean issues are being discussed between </p><p>Turkey and Greece in the form of exploratory contacts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Turkey hopes this draft, as in the past, will not be </p><p>supported in the Committee for further action and the US </p><p>Administration will spare no effort to this end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
