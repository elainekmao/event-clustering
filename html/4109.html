<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 002018 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR SA/FO ROCCA, CAMP </p><p>ALSO FOR SA/INS (FOR JWALLER); SA/PAB SA/RA (FOR SCENSNY) </p><p>ALSO FOR SA/PD LJIRWIN, WREINCKENS, SHOVANEC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KMDR, KPAO, SL, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  LTTE launches Sinhala monthly </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  Colombo 1828 </p><p> </p><p>1.  In recent weeks rumors have circulated in Colombo and </p><p>elsewhere on the Island regarding a Sinhala newspaper to </p><p>be published by the LTTE.  The purpose of the </p><p>publication:  to tell the Tigers\' story to Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>Sinhalese publics.  Its name:  DEDUNNA (or "Rainbow"). </p><p> </p><p>2.  Although DEDUNNA appears to have begun publication in </p><p>August 2002, we were unable to obtain a copy until last </p><p>week when we received the September issue.  According to </p><p>its masthead, DEDUNNA is an "official Sinhala monthly </p><p>publication of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE)."  It is printed by Neela Printers in </p><p>Killinochchi (a village on the Jaffna Peninsula). </p><p> </p><p>3.  The September issue gives front-page prominence to </p><p>Prabhakaran\'s Heroes Day message under the headline "We </p><p>are committed to peace."  It also carries a back-page </p><p>editorial, "Concept of Motherland ... foundation of </p><p>living collectively," a translation of which appears at </p><p>para. 7 below. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Articles in the September issue include: </p><p> </p><p>- "Praise for De-mining Team in Vanni" (which says that </p><p>the USG-funded QRDF project has removed 90,000 landmines </p><p>from the Jaffna Peninsula). </p><p> </p><p>- "Batticaloa fishermen on a protest march requesting </p><p>removal of sanctions ... and return of fishing gear." </p><p> </p><p>- "Allow the returnees to Mannar\' requests Monitoring </p><p>Committee." </p><p> </p><p>- "Parents of disappeared persons in Jaffna to take legal </p><p>action." </p><p> </p><p>5.  The issue also carries a "News Untold" section, </p><p>featuring pieces such as "Navy attacks citizens of </p><p>Karainagar," "Ban on fishing to fishermen of </p><p>Thondamanaru area," "Army obstructs civil life in </p><p>Vadamaarachchi," "20% of students in Vanni are suffering </p><p>from mental stress, "Felling of Palmyrah trees in </p><p>Thoppukadu area," "400 acres of cultivable land </p><p>neglected," and "Obstructions to returnees of Madagal." </p><p> </p><p>6.  Comment.  According to its publishers, DEDUNNA\'s </p><p>purpose is to share the LTTE opinions and policies with </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s Sinhalese-speaking majority.  Specifically, </p><p>it wants to explain LTTE activities, to nudge forward the </p><p>"normalization of relationships between two major ethnic </p><p>groups," and, when necessary, to "highlight lapses on </p><p>the part of the governments past and present."  The </p><p>September -- and, perhaps, the August -- issue attempts </p><p>to highlight the Tigers\' story.  Unfortunately, DEDUNNA </p><p>is circulated so inefficiently that even a major foreign </p><p>mission such as our own finds it difficult to obtain </p><p>copies.  How much less likely must it be for the average </p><p>Sinhalese reader -- not to mention the Island\'s large </p><p>anti-LTTE element -- to read DUDUNNA.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Block excerpts from editorial:  "Concept of </p><p>Motherland.  Foundation of living collectively": </p><p> </p><p>... What do Tamils mean when they talk about their </p><p>motherland?  Why do they need such a motherland?  Is a </p><p>Tamilese motherland against the rights of the Sinhalese? </p><p>Answers are required to set aside misunderstanding and </p><p>clear minds ... </p><p> </p><p>It is true that this island belongs to everyone, but </p><p>Sinhalese culture has been preserved and nurtured in the </p><p>South and Tamil culture in the Northeast.  Likewise </p><p>Veddahs (aborigines) live in Dambana and Bintenna as </p><p>suits their culture...  When people of different </p><p>ethnicity live in different places ... how can their </p><p>right to a motherland be denied? </p><p> </p><p>Tamils have lived in North and East for centuries.  They </p><p>like to be tied to the nature and environment of their </p><p>birthplace.  Our concept of motherland is a birthplace </p><p>with such ties.  Such ties can be neither made nor </p><p>denied. </p><p> </p><p>The connection between birthplace and culture, language </p><p>and lifestyle is unbreakable.  When others want to </p><p>encroach upon their lifestyle people fight against it. </p><p>Veediya Bandara (Sinhala King) and King Sangiliyan (Tamil </p><p>King) fought against Portuguese, Veera Puran Appu </p><p>(Sinhalese), and Bandara Vanniyan (Tamil) fought against </p><p>British, all to safeguard their birthplace (or </p><p>motherland). </p><p>Why do Sinhalese people demonstrate against airport </p><p>expansion and the development of highways.  Why do their </p><p>farmers protest against the sale of phosphate deposits in </p><p>Eppawala?  It is to protect their birthplace and the </p><p>lifestyle that they love.  Tamil people think the same </p><p>way.  When 27 Grama Seva Niladhari divisions (administrative </p><p>units ... managed by government officials) are brought under </p><p>the Palali Army Complex, do not the farmers of that area, </p><p>whose cultivation, land, lifestyle is lost, have the right </p><p>to protest?  Don\'t people who lose their property, churches, </p><p>schools, etc., have the right to fight against such losses? </p><p> </p><p>The birthplace of one ethnic group is not a no-go-zone </p><p>for another.  Motherland (birthplace) is the land where </p><p>ancestors toiled and died, a land fertilized by the sweat </p><p>of ancestors, where one likes to live with his/her kith </p><p>and kin and die in peace.  Don\'t environmentalists fight </p><p>for the rights of animals when their habitats are </p><p>destroyed?  Shouldn\'t the Tamil-speaking people of North </p><p>and East enjoy the same liberty?  Is that a denial of </p><p>other peoples\' rights?  How can the struggle for one\'s </p><p>rights be terrorism? </p><p> </p><p>Anger between Tamils and Sinhalese is a very recent </p><p>thing; their friendship has a long history...  That </p><p>friendship was safe because diversity was safeguarded. </p><p>The fisher folk of Negombo fished the seas of Mullaitivu, </p><p>not under government sponsorship or under the security of </p><p>defense forces but through trust and friendship.  Once </p><p>the defense forces came in ... the friendship was broken. </p><p>Aren\'t your doors open to your brother?  But will you </p><p>accept those who enter your house forcibly? </p><p> </p><p>A lasting solution will require new political thinking </p><p>and new political structures.  Their basis should be </p><p>equality and diversity.  Accepting the rights of a Tamil </p><p>motherland means accepting equality and diversity.  It is </p><p>not something to be afraid of.  Rather, it is an </p><p>experiment in coexistence. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
