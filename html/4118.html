<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 002981 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EB, DRL/IL, WHA/PPC, WHA/EPSC, AND WHA/CEN </p><p>STATE PASS AID FOR LAC/CEN </p><p>DOL FOR ILAB </p><p>DOL PASS BLS </p><p>COMMERCE FOR CENSUS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, ECON, SOCI, PHUM, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAS ISSUES 2001 CENSUS FIGURES; POPULATION </p><p>TOPS 6.5 MILLION </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) On October 18, National Institute of Statistics (INE) </p><p>Director Magdalena Garcia presented the numbers from the 2001 </p><p>census to Acting President Vicente Williams.  The last census </p><p>in Honduras was conducted in 1988 and INE utilized the 1988 </p><p>statistics during the presentation as a reference point for </p><p>comparisons.  Projected numbers for 2015 were also featured. </p><p> (Note: The following statistics are the national average </p><p>unless specified.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The population of Honduras is currently 6,535,344, up </p><p>from 4,614,377 in 1988, with 44.8 percent of the people </p><p>living in urban areas.  A growth rate of 2.64 percent per </p><p>year (down from a 3.11 rate of growth in 1988) leads INE to </p><p>estimate the population to reach approximately 8,958,301 in </p><p>the year 2015.  Average life expectancy has increased from 65 </p><p>years in 1988 to 71 years in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) To determine the poverty level, the definition of </p><p>people with "unsatisfied basic necessities" was utilized. </p><p>From this, INE determined that 65.5 percent are living in </p><p>poverty while 47.4 percent are living in extreme poverty.  In </p><p>the eastern department of Gracias a Dios on the Caribbean </p><p>coast, almost 90 percent of the people are living at or below </p><p>the poverty level.  Teenage mothers have increased in number </p><p>from 20,113 in 1988 to 32,475 in 2001.  On the positive side, </p><p>the literacy rate of persons 15 years old and above has </p><p>jumped from 66 percent in 1988 to 80 percent in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Other census statistics are currently being processed </p><p>and finalized.  For further information, refer to the INE </p><p>website at http://www.ine.online.hn. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Comment: PolOffs previously met October 16 with </p><p>Garcia to discuss Honduran statistical issues as they related </p><p>to labor and human rights issues.  Garcia, who is  favorably </p><p>known to Post and has a strong background as a statistician, </p><p>was confident that the census figures were accurate.  This </p><p>was despite the fact that the numbers were gathered by a </p><p>temporary executive branch agency established solely for the </p><p>census that left the raw data for INE to tabulate and </p><p>analyze.  Garcia said she had been besieged by requests from </p><p>congressmen for detailed census information and that she was </p><p>determined to put everything on the Internet to have the </p><p>information available to all (and to reduce requests on her </p><p>relatively small staff).  INE also collaborates with the </p><p>Honduran Central Bank on economic statistical issues.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Post will be sending septel in the coming month with a </p><p>more detailed USAID analysis of the 2001 census, including </p><p>more comparisons to the 1988 census. </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
