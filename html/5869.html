NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: TSVANGIRAI TRIAL: BEN-MENASHE CROSS-EXAMINATION </p><p>CONTINUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 313 </p><p>     B. HARARE 259 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER KIMBERLY JEMISON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) A </p><p>ND (D). </p><p> </p><p> Summary.  1.  (C) The treason trial of Movement for </p><p>Democratic Change (MDC) officials Morgan Tsvangirai, Welshman </p><p>Ncube, and Renson Gasela entered its fourteenth day on </p><p>February 20.  Since February 12, defense counsel has </p><p>continued its intensive cross-examination of the state\'s star </p><p>witness, Ari Ben-Menashe.  Lead defense attorney George Bizos </p><p>tried to discredit Ben-Menashe by highlighting the </p><p>inconsistencies in his testimony about his U.S. contacts, </p><p>financial transactions between Dickens & Madson (DM) and the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ), details of the second and third </p><p>meetings with the defendants, and the legitimacy of DM. </p><p>Presiding Judge Paddington Garwe has tried to assert his </p><p>authority more by cutting short Ben-Menashe,s tirades and </p><p>ordering him to listen to and answer Bizos,s questions </p><p>succinctly.  Nonetheless, Ben-Menashe has continued to engage </p><p>in outrageous behavior in court, dismissing questions he did </p><p>not want to answer and using inappropriate language.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Financial Transactions </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Bizos resumed his cross-examination on the afternoon </p><p>of February 12, after the issue of the contract with the </p><p>Government of Zimbabwe was resolved that same morning (see </p><p>reftel).  Bizos began by asking Ben-Menashe whether he had </p><p>received payment for the videotape of the third meeting, a </p><p>charge Ben-Menashe vehemently denied, claiming he never </p><p>received money "personally".  Ben-Menashe maintained that he </p><p>passed on the money to the people who were in charge of </p><p>creating the videotape.  Bizos also asked if Ben-Menashe had </p><p>received money from the GOZ before signing the January 10, </p><p>2002 contract.  Ben-Menashe maintained that he had had no </p><p>contact with the GOZ prior to the contract. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) On February 19, Bizos revisited the issue of payment </p><p>when he asked Ben-Menashe about several documents (financial </p><p>account statements, contracts, and certificate of </p><p>registration) the defense asked him to produce for the court. </p><p> Ben-Menashe had none of the documents, claiming that some of </p><p>the finacial account information, which might have shown </p><p>financial transactions between DM and the GOZ, had been </p><p>destroyed.  He also claimed he could not get some of the </p><p>requested bank information because of pending lawsuits </p><p>against DM by the MDC and an Australian company. </p><p> </p><p>Discrediting Ben-Menashe and Dickens & Madson </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Throughout the week, Bizos chipped away at </p><p>Ben-Menashe,s credibility.  On February 13, Bizos attempted </p><p>to introduce evidence that would attest to Ben-Menashe,s </p><p>soiled reputation and lack of credibility.  The evidence was </p><p>a list of documents from press sources and a former employee. </p><p> The prosecutor tried to get the court to limit challenges to </p><p>Ben-Menashe,s credibility.  The judge entertained arguments </p><p>from both sides as to the various pieces of evidence </p><p>submitted by the defense and called for a recess about one </p><p>hour into the hearing.  Court reconvened after lunch and the </p><p>documents were not entered into evidence. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On February 19, Bizos began his attack of DM by asking </p><p>for copies of the certificates of registration and </p><p>questioning Ben-Menashe about the principal officers in the </p><p>company.  Ben-Menashe told Bizos that he would not provide </p><p>documents that are available in the public domain.  Bizos </p><p>informed Ben-Menashe that the defense could not find the </p><p>certificates.  Bizos said he had reason to believe DM was not </p><p>registered.  Bizos asked the judge to invoke a section of the </p><p>Crimanl Procedure and Evidence Act that gives the judge power </p><p>to commit a witness to prison for failing to answer questions </p><p>or failing/refusing to produce documents without a just </p><p>excuse.  Bizos has said that if the certificate of </p><p>registration, financial account statements, and a list of </p><p>employees were not produced, then the defense would oppose </p><p>Ben-Menashe\'s requests to leave the country prior to </p><p>completion of his testimony. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Bizos,s next line of questioning concerned the </p><p>principal officers in DM.  According to Ben-Menashe, there </p><p>are only four high-level people in the company: Alexander </p><p>Legault as shareholder and financial officer, David Sullivan </p><p>as accountant, Ben-Menashe as shareholder, and Francis Lang </p><p>as director.  When asked to explain the day-to-day activities </p><p>of the person in the directorship position, Ben-Menashe could </p><p>not provide an answer. </p><p>U.S. Contacts </p><p>------------- </p><p>7.  (U) During the afternoon session on February 13, Bizos </p><p>began to question Ben-Menashe about his contacts in the US </p><p>Government and about the various meetings with the MDC. </p><p>Ben-Menashe first claimed to know a high-level person in the </p><p>State Department but refused to name the person.  Later he </p><p>denied knowing anyone in the State Department, claiming he </p><p>only knew a high-level U.S. government official.  Bizos </p><p>resumed this line of questioning during the February 14 </p><p>afternoon session but Ben-Menashe avoided answering the </p><p>questions.  Ben-Menashe maintained that Tsvangirai claimed to </p><p>have contacted and won the support of the U.S. Government and </p><p>the CIA in the coup plot.  Bizos asked Ben Menashe that if </p><p>Tsvangirai had already contacted the U.S. and taken other </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>preparatory steps, then contracting DM was unnecessary. </p><p>Ben-Menashe had no comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Second and Third Meetings </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>8.  (U) On February 18, Bizos focused on a fifteen-page typed </p><p>transcript of the audio recording of the second meeting </p><p>between Tsvangirai and Ben-Menashe in London, prepared by DM </p><p>employee Tara Thomas, who was in attendance.  To 90 percent </p><p>of Bizos,s questions, Ben-Menashe responded that he did not </p><p>remember if the cited text was said.  Perhaps embarrassed by </p><p>the fact that Tsvangirai not once discussed Mugabe\'s </p><p>assassination in the transcript, Ben-Menashe discredited </p><p>Thomas,s transcript, saying she picked out words here and </p><p>there but that the tape was inaudible and the transcript did </p><p>not reflect the totality of the meeting.  (NOTE: On February </p><p>13, Ben-Menashe claimed he could not remember whom in the GOZ </p><p>he had given the audiotape to nor could he remember who had </p><p>transcribed the tape. END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) On February 20, Bizos again asked Ben-Menashe </p><p>questions about the third, infamous meeting in Montreal.  In </p><p>response to Bizos\'s questions, Ben-Menashe\'s standard answer </p><p>was that he did not remember.  When asked if the purpose of </p><p>the third meeting was to furnish evidence of a planned coup </p><p>d\'etat, Ben-Menashe responded in the affirmative.  On </p><p>February 13, Ben-Menashe maintained that he was never </p><p>interested in having the MDC as a client and that he only met </p><p>with them because he wanted to report the plot to the </p><p>appropriate authorities in the U.S., Canada, and Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>Ben-Menashe, Garwe, and Bizos\'s Conduct </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Ben-Menashe continues to act outrageously in the </p><p>witness box, regularly denigrating Bizos when asked questions </p><p>he doesn\'t want to answer, interrupting Garwe and Bizos, and </p><p>demonstrating a short fuse. Garwe appears to be getting tired </p><p>of Ben-Menashe,s antics and has begun directing him to </p><p>answer questions directly and precisely.  Garwe even shook </p><p>his head after he had to stop Ben-Menashe in the middle of a </p><p>tirade to ask him to answer the question, to which </p><p>Ben-Menashe asked, "What was the question?" </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Bizos is also playing to the court.  He frequently </p><p>turns towards the journalists when Ben-Menashe goes off on a </p><p>tangent and he has turned towards his clients and smiled when </p><p>Ben-Menashe gets unnerved.  Garwe cautioned Bizos against </p><p>unnecessarily provoking Ben-Menashe. </p><p> </p><p>Access </p><p>------ </p><p>12.  (U) It appears as though most interested parties are </p><p>being admitted to the courtroom to witness the trial. </p><p>Diplomats and independent journalists are present for every </p><p>session, and members of the general public are still being </p><p>granted access.  The standing room only crowds have dwindled </p><p>somewhat, and there are a few empty seats at each session. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
