<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002346 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT U. S. UNDER FIRE; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Bush wants to create space for </p><p>      decision strike on Iraq" the October 28 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "The Herald" carried the </p><p>      following op-ed by Chinondidyachii Mararike on page 8: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Will the U.S. go ahead and launch military </p><p>      strikes against Iraq or will Saddam Hussein comply </p><p>      with Bush\'s ultimatum that `Iraq complies with all the </p><p>      relevant UN resolutions.?\'  Surely these are not the </p><p>      right questions to ask.  What is right to ask is why </p><p>      now, and after months of dilly-dallying, has Bush seen </p><p>      it fit to seek UN approval for America\'s so-called war </p><p>      on terrorism?  Is the issue simply that of weapons </p><p>      inspections or is there a greater and even more </p><p>      sinister agenda than the inarticulate Bush is either </p><p>      able or willing to articulate? </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .The point then is that Bush\'s 12 September </p><p>      2002 speech to the 190-member UN General </p><p>      Assembly was intended to provide international </p><p>      cover for American unilateralism, and thus give </p><p>      legitimacy to Bush\'s need for a regime change </p><p>      not only in Iraq but in other states that stand </p><p>      up against U.S. domination and control. </p><p> </p><p>      ". . .Surely if Bush had concern for upholding </p><p>      human rights then his government would not </p><p>      support, arm and underwrite the Israeli army to </p><p>      mount military campaigns against innocent </p><p>      Palestinians.  And if America has respect for </p><p>      the rule of law then it would understand the </p><p>      Zimbabwean government\'s commitment to correcting </p><p>      the injustices of colonialism and contemporary </p><p>      U.S.-supported neo-colonialism and not impose </p><p>      punitive sanctions against our entire </p><p>      leadership.  I think it\'s time somebody reminded </p><p>      Bush, and his `blind\' Caucasian American </p><p>      followers, that America is not the only </p><p>      superpower in the world but that people in </p><p>      countries continuously resisting U.S. </p><p>      imperialism are in fact the superpowers. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
