(U) THE HOLY SEE, CATHOLIC DIOCESES WORLDWIDE, </p><p>AFFILIATED NGO\'S AND CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS ORDERS ARE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT, IF OFTEN OVERLOOKED, PLAYERS IN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AND HUMANITARIAN RELIEF EFFORTS.  THE CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCH IS IN EFFECT THE WORLD\'S LARGEST INTERNATIONAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AGENCY: SOME FOUR MILLION LAY PEOPLE, SISTERS, </p><p>MONKS, PRIESTS AND BISHOPS WORKING IN VARIOUS FORMS OF </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY MAKE A CONTRIBUTION WORTH BILLIONS OF </p><p>DOLLARS IN HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS, UNIVERSITIES, TECHNICAL, </p><p>AGRICULTURAL AND VOCATIONAL FACILITIES, AND SOCIAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPING WORLD. THIS </p><p>"COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE" IS DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE CHURCH\'S </p><p>SOCIAL DOCTRINE, WHICH HAS BEEN EXPANDED AND INTENSIFIED IN </p><p>THE POST-VATICAN II PERIOD WHEN THE CHURCH FIRST LINKED </p><p>WORLD PEACE TO HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. FOR THE HOLY SEE, THE </p><p>INHERENT AND INALIENABLE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON FORMS </p><p>THE CORE OF ITS DEVELOPMENT POLICY; PEOPLE MATTER, AND THEIR </p><p>SPIRITUAL, SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING IS AT THE HEART OF </p><p>THE HOLY SEE\'S APPROACH TO FOREIGN POLICY.

(U) THE HOLY SEE IS AN ACTIVE "HANDS ON" PLAYER IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHOSE ROLE IS NOT LIMITED TO </p><p>TEACHING AND ENCOURAGING CHARITY. IN FACT, THE HOLY SEE </p><p>OPERATES A GLOBAL RELIEF AGENCY, IS PRESENT IN THE MOST </p><p>REMOTE AND BADLY AFFLICTED CRISES AREAS IN THE WORLD, AND </p><p>CARES FOR 25 PERCENT OF ALL HIV/AIDS VICTIMS WORLDWIDE. IN </p><p>SOME COUNTRIES, CATHOLIC AGENCIES ARE AMONG THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELD OF </p><p>EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE.  THE HOLY SEE\'S DEVELOPMENT </p><p>AGENCIES AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS ARE OPEN TO PARTNERING </p><p>WITH THE USG, AND EMBASSY BELIEVES THERE IS SCOPE FOR CLOSER </p><p>COORDINATION IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ON HUMAN AND </p><p>SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  DESPITE SOME SKEPTICISM OF </p><p>COMMERCIAL MOTIVES BEHIND CERTAIN U.S. INITIATIVES AND </p><p>APPROACHES TO DEVELOPMENT, THE HOLY SEE\'S VIEWS ON </p><p>DEVELOPMENT HAVE MOVED CLOSER TO U.S. VIEWS IN RECENT TIMES </p><p>REGARDING THE NEED FOR RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT IN DEVELOPING </p><p>COUNTRIES (REFTEL). WE BELIEVE THE HOLY SEE WILL PROVE TO BE </p><p>AN INCREASINGLY USEFUL ALLY IN PROMOTING THESE VIEWS </p><p>WORLDWIDE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) HOLY SEE CABINET-LEVEL DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENTS </p><p>(DICASTRIES), WHICH FUNCTION AS THINK TANKS AND POLICY </p><p>MAKING AGENCIES, ARE INFLUENTIAL IN SHAPING A GLOBAL </p><p>CONSENSUS ON DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES FOR A RANGE OF ISSUES </p><p>INCLUDING HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, MIGRATION, GLOBALIZATION, </p><p>AND HEALTH.

CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS </p><p>ORDERS SUCH AS THE JESUITS, FRANCISCANS AND DOMINICANS, AND </p><p>NATIONAL BISHOPS CONFERENCES WORLDWIDE, ENGAGE IN </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, OFTEN IN COLLABORATION WITH UN </p><p>AGENCIES AND INTERNATIONAL NGOS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>THE STRUCTURES OF COMPASSION AND CHARITY: PONTIFICAL </p><p>COUNCILS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>4.

THESE INCLUDE RELIGIOUS ORDERS AND SEMI-OFFICIAL </p><p>BODIES SUCH AS CARITAS INTERNATIONAL, THE SANT\'EGIDIO </p><p>COMMUNITY, AND PRIVATE AGENCIES.  THE HOLY SEE HAS </p><p>ESTABLISHED PARTNERSHIPS FOR DEVELOPMENT WITH UNITED NATIONS </p><p>AGENCIES AND OTHER SECULAR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AS </p><p>WELL AS NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONFRONT POVERTY, UNDER- </p><p>DEVELOPMENT, REFUGEE CRISES, PANDEMICS AND FAMINE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.   (U) THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE (PCJP) </p><p>FOSTERS DEVELOPMENT OF NEEDY REGIONS AND PROMOTES SOCIAL </p><p>JUSTICE (SOCIAL EQUITY) INTERNATIONALLY. ITS BRIEF INCLUDES </p><p>LABOR ISSUES, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, DEVELOPMENT POLICY, </p><p>AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. IT ALSO PROMOTES REFLECTION ON </p><p>ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMS -- INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF </p><p>GLOBALIZATION -- PRODUCING IN 1999 FOR EXAMPLE, A REFLECTION </p><p>ON TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN PREPARATION FOR THE WTO </p><p>"MILLENNIUM ROUND."  THE COUNCIL ALSO ADDRESSES </p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES. THE PCJP, OFTEN </p><p>ON BEHALF OF THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, TREATS A BROAD </p><p>RANGE OF ISSUES RELATED TO WAR, DISARMAMENT AND THE ARMS </p><p>TRADE, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, AND VIOLENCE IN ALL ITS </p><p>MANIFESTATIONS -- INCLUDING TERRORISM AND XENOPHOBIC </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00283  02 OF 05  241034Z </p><p>NATIONALISM. IT IS A FOCAL POINT FOR THE CHURCH\'S HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS POLICY, DEVELOPING ITS PLACE IN CHURCH TEACHING, </p><p>ANALYZING ISSUES UNDER DISCUSSION IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, </p><p>AND PROVIDING ADVOCACY FOR VICTIMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>VIOLATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>6.   (U) THE PCJP ALSO EXAMINES POLITICAL SYSTEMS AND THE </p><p>ROLE OF CATHOLICS IN POLITICS IN LIGHT OF THE CHURCH\'S </p><p>DESIRE TO WALK THE PHILOSOPHICAL TIGHTROPE BETWEEN RELIGIOUS </p><p>BELIEF AND SECULAR POLITICS.  SINCE THE EARLY 1960\'S THE </p><p>HOLY SEE HAS JUDGED SOME POLITICAL SYSTEMS AS CLOSER TO </p><p>CHURCH THINKING THAN OTHERS: ATHEISTIC COMMUNISM HAS BEEN </p><p>FLATLY REJECTED, RIGHT-WING MILITARY REGIMES SEVERELY </p><p>CRITICIZED, AND LIBERAL CAPITALIST SYSTEMS TOLERATED BUT </p><p>MONITORED CLOSELY FOR INCLUSION OF SOCIAL WELFARE </p><p>PROVISIONS.  A KEY ISSUE FOR THE COUNCIL IS HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>WHICH IT TREATS IN THREE DISTINCT WAYS: DEVELOPING ITS PLACE </p><p>IN CHURCH TEACHING, ANALYSIS OF ISSUES UNDER DISCUSSION IN </p><p>INTERNATIONAL FORA, PROVIDING ADVOCACY FOR VICTIMS OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  PCJP OFFICIALS REPRESENT THE HOLY SEE AT </p><p>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL OR DISARMAMENT </p><p>CONFERENCES.  THE PROMOTION OF FORMER HOLY SEE PERMANENT </p><p>OBSERVER TO THE UN, ARCHBISHOP RENATO MARTINO, TO HEAD THE </p><p>PCJP AUGERS WELL FOR A MORE ACTIVIST PCJP AND FOR EVEN </p><p>CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND THE USG ON MANY </p><p>DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.  MARTINO LIVED IN THE U.S. FOR 18 YEARS </p><p>AND UNDERSTANDS US VALUES AND POLICY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER </p><p>NON-AMERICAN AT THE HOLY SEE.  WHILE NOT ALWAYS IN AGREEMENT </p><p>WITH THE US, MARTINO HAS SPOKEN OUT IN FAVOR OF BIOTECH </p><p>FOODS TO AVERT STARVATION, ASSERTING THE ISSUE IS MORE </p><p>POLITICAL THAN SCIENTIFIC. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  00283  02 OF 05  241034Z </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR MIGRANTS AND ITINERANT PEOPLES </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.   (U) PCMIP FOCUSES ON PEOPLE ON THE MOVE INCLUDING </p><p>REFUGEES, ECONOMIC MIGRANTS, INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS </p><p>AND NOMADIC PEOPLES SUCH AS ROMA AND SINTI.  THE COUNCIL </p><p>WORKS IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CATHOLIC </p><p>MIGRATION COMMISSION, CARITAS INTERNATIONALIS AND THE JESUIT </p><p>REFUGEE SERVICES, WHICH IN TURN OPERATE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL </p><p>IN PLACES SUCH AS KOSOVO AND AFRICA\'S GREAT LAKES REGION </p><p>PROVIDING HEALTH CARE, ADVOCACY SERVICES AND REPATRIATION </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  THE PCMIP SEEKS TO ENSURE HOLY SEE POLICY AND </p><p>SENSIBILITIES ARE RESPECTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.  RECENTLY </p><p>PARTNERSHIPS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AT THE ECUMENICAL AND </p><p>INTER-RELIGIOUS LEVEL IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHAD, ANGOLA AND </p><p>MACEDONIA TO ENSURE A GREATER OUTREACH TO REFUGEES AND </p><p>INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE.  PCMIP WORKS CLOSELY WITH UNHCR </p><p>ON MORAL AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ISSUES, AND IN AN ADVOCACY </p><p>ROLE FOR PARTICULAR GROUPS -- ROMA/GYPSIES FOR EXAMPLE.  THE </p><p>HOLY SEE IS A MEMBER OF THE UNHCR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND </p><p>FOSTERS PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN UNHCR AND CATHOLIC CHURCH-BASED </p><p>AGENCIES.

A FURTHER EXAMPLE OF THE </p><p>EXTENT OF JESUIT INVOLVEMENT IN SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS IN </p><p>INDIA WHERE THE JESUIT INDIAN SOCIAL INSTITUTE WORKS WITH </p><p>SOME 5000 VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS TO COORDINATE AND NETWORK </p><p>FOR THE SOCIAL-CULTURAL RIGHTS OF THE POOR AND MARGINALIZED. </p><p>SIMILAR EFFORTS ARE CARRIED OUT WORLDWIDE BY HUNDREDS OF </p><p>RELIGIOUS ORDERS.  SIMILAR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE </p><p>CONDUCTED BY OTHER RELIGIOUS ORDERS INCLUDING FRANCISCANS </p><p>AND DOMINICANS. </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U) NATIONAL GROUPINGS OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS ALSO ENGAGE </p><p>IN DEVELOPMENT WORK, OFTEN THROUGH SPECIFICALLY CONSTITUTED </p><p>AGENCIES. THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN BISHOPS CONDUCT HUNDREDS OF </p><p>EDUCATION, PREVENTION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA, NAMIBIA, LESOTHO, SWAZILAND AND BOTSWANA, MAKING IT </p><p>ONE OF THE KEY AGENCIES IN A REGION WHERE CATHOLICS ARE A </p><p>MINORITY.  THE US BISHOPS ARE SIMILARLY ACTIVE IN CENTRAL </p><p>AMERICA. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00283  05 OF 05  241035Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU) THE HOLY SEE ITSELF APPEARS TO HAVE MADE A </p><p>PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT IN RECENT YEARS ON ITS APPROACH TO </p><p>DEVELOPMENT.  WHILE MANY POSITION PAPERS STILL CARRY MORE </p><p>THAN A HINT OF A DEVELOPMENT MESSAGE ROOTED IN THE HALCYON </p><p>DAYS OF LIBERATION THEOLOGY AND THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENT THEORY OF THE LATE 1960S, RECENT STATEMENTS -- </p><p>AT THE JOHANNESBURG SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE -- REFLECT A POSITION CLOSER TO THAT OF THE USG. </p><p>RECIPIENTS OF DEVELOPMENT AID ARE ASKED TO BECOME </p><p>PROTAGONISTS AND PARTNERS IN THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT. CONCEPTS </p><p>SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY, GOOD GOVERNANCE, ACCOUNTABILITY AND </p><p>MARKET LIBERALIZATION NOW PROVIDE A COUNTERBALANCE TO </p><p>BLAMING "UNJUST STRUCTURES" OR "UNBRIDLED CAPITALISM" FOR </p><p>THE WORLD\'S WOES.  THE POPE HAS REINFORCED THESE CONCEPTS IN </p><p>RECENT MESSAGES AND STATEMENTS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE NEW </p><p>PERSPECTIVE WILL TRICKLE DOWN FROM THE DICASTERIES TO </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES TO SHAPE THEIR POLICIES AND STRATEGIES. </p><p>GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VATICAN\'S VOICE THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>DEVELOPING WORLD. EMBASSY BELIEVES USG DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES </p><p>SHOULD SEEK TO BROADEN CONTACTS WITH THE HOLY SEE TO BUILD </p><p>SUPPORT FOR OUR DEVELOPMENT POLICIES AND INITIATIVES AND TO </p><p>DEVELOP SYNERGIES WITH THE MANY VATICAN-RELATED DEVELOPMENT </p><p>AGENCIES.
