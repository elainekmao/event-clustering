<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003044 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/10/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETTC, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN\'S ECONOMIC OLD GUARD FLEXES MUSCLES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 1721 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 2334 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Anti-normalization, pro-Iraq, and anti-reform </p><p>elements in Jordan\'s business community are trying to </p><p>re-establish themselves in the kingdom\'s economic </p><p>decision-making arena.  These recidivist groups have been </p><p>encouraged by an increase in anti-American, and hence </p><p>anti-globalization, feeling since Israeli incursions into </p><p>Palestinian areas stepped up earlier this year.  While their </p><p>strengthened influence is probably temporary, it could </p><p>complicate the GOJ\'s progress on promoting economic openness </p><p>in the short term.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>POWER PLAY IN AMMAN CHAMBER OF INDUSTRY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (c)  The Amman Chamber of Industry (ACI) announced in </p><p>late April that 10 of the 12 members of its board of </p><p>directors had resigned.  Officially, this followed an </p><p>expression of no confidence by the majority of board members </p><p>in ACI Chairman Othman Bdeir\'s ability to manage the </p><p>chamber\'s interests.  Unofficially, the move is believed to </p><p>be a power play by influential businessmen who sell their </p><p>products to Iraq under the bilateral oil and trade protocols </p><p>(led by former ACI chairman Khaldoun Abu Hassan) to regain </p><p>control of the ACI and re-energize and re-orient its </p><p>political activities.  The two remaining board members are </p><p>also pro-Iraq, and have ties to Abu Hassan and to PM Abul </p><p>Ragheb and former Trade Minister Wasef Azar (all of whom are </p><p>seen as supporters of the Iraq trade).  We have also heard </p><p>from government contacts that one of the reasons for the </p><p>resignations was a belief by some members that the ACI was </p><p>not doing enough to advocate for a boycott of US products. </p><p>It is unclear at this point if the interim board appointed by </p><p>Trade Minister Bashir and that includes a number of </p><p>forward-thinking businessmen will be able to solidify its </p><p>position and remain in place, or if Abu Hassan will succeed </p><p>in re-taking control of the ACI. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>NEW CHAMBERS LAW WORRIES PRO-QIZ GROUPS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (c)  Meanwhile, Irbid Chamber of Industry (ICI) chairman </p><p>Maher al Nasser told us recently that a law reforming the </p><p>operations of Jordan\'s three local chambers of industry is </p><p>currently under consideration in the cabinet.  Nasser worried </p><p>that the law is a bid by the ACI to merge the chambers into a </p><p>single chamber under its control.  Nasser called this </p><p>potentially disastrous, as the ACI is dominated by </p><p>Palestinian Jordanians who, he said, want to politicize the </p><p>chambers.  He said ACI members want other chambers to support </p><p>a boycott of U.S. products, support "anti-normalization" </p><p>efforts (i.e. oppose doing business with Israel), and give </p><p>assistance to the Palestinian cause.  An East-Banker and </p><p>chairman of a chamber that has many QIZ exporters as members </p><p>(and hence does extensive business with Israel), Nasser said </p><p>the impact of such a law on the ability of the chambers in </p><p>Irbid and Zarqa to pursue liberal trade practices could be </p><p>severe. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (c)  In a separate conversation, Trade Ministry Secretary </p><p>General Samer Tawil told Econ chief that the proposed law </p><p>would not subsume the other chambers under the ACI, but would </p><p>instead establish an additional body, a national federation </p><p>of chambers of industry, as an umbrella group.  The local </p><p>chambers would retain their separate identities.  He said a </p><p>federation would function similarly to the existing </p><p>federation of chambers of commerce (note: this body is a </p><p>highly politicized, but largely ineffective and essentially </p><p>marginal grouping of equally ineffective local chambers of </p><p>commerce.  End note.).  Tawil said the current system, which </p><p>dates from 1949, was in dire need of reform to help Jordanian </p><p>companies upgrade their standards and market themselves to be </p><p>able to take advantage of opportunities under the FTA and </p><p>other new trade programs - rather than continue to rely on </p><p>the Iraqi market.  He was, however, worried that a new law </p><p>would require new chamber elections that in the current </p><p>political environment could put anti-normalizers and pro-Iraq </p><p>elements in control.  Thus, he said he would advocate </p><p>delaying chamber elections if the new law is enacted. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (c)  The dramatic worsening of the situation in the West </p><p>Bank over the past two months created an opening for </p><p>old-guard elements of the business community to re-insert </p><p>their agendas into the economic policy debate in the kingdom. </p><p> They hope to take advantage of an increase in popular </p><p>displeasure with the GOJ\'s relationships with Israel and the </p><p>U.S. to push a politicized economic agenda focused on </p><p>monopolizing government contracts, trade with Iraq, and </p><p>anti-normalization.  Such efforts by economic reactionaries </p><p>are reflective of ongoing tensions between different segments </p><p>of Jordan\'s business community -- between old guard, </p><p>subsidy-dependent industrialists and new economy businessmen, </p><p>and between "pure" private sector business interests and </p><p>those who wish to tie economic decisions to political stands </p><p>on Iraq and Palestine. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (c)  Although distracted by the regional political </p><p>situation in recent months (ref a), the GOJ commitment to </p><p>reform highlighted in the King\'s recent visit to Washington </p><p>means the momentum for economic liberalization will continue. </p><p> Indeed, senior GOJ officials tell us they are finalizing a </p><p>number of new economic reform bills, for which they expect to </p><p>secure cabinet approval before the end of June (septel).  In </p><p>the short run, though, the momentum of reform will be slowed </p><p>to the extent that the old guard is able to capitalize on </p><p>political developments to advance their self-interested </p><p>agenda. </p><p>Gnehm </p><p></p></div>
