Reasons </p><p>1.5 (c) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Polmiloff met MFA Disarmament Second Secretary Aykut </p><p>Kumbaroglu on April 16 and delivered ref a demarche. </p><p>Kumbaroglu welcomed the clarification on Iran\'s nuclear </p><p>program and promised to convey the information at once to the </p><p>Turkish Mission in Vienna as well as other relevant GOT </p><p>offices.  Kumbaroglu agreed that Iran\'s becoming a party to </p><p>the Additional Protocol would be a "positive step," but by no </p><p>means indicated transparent compliance or proof of Iran </p><p>having abandoned its nuclear weapons program.  He both hopes </p><p>and expects the IAEA will seek a more complete clarification </p><p>about Iran\'s program and continue to monitor the situation on </p><p>an urgent basis.  Kumbaroglu said that Turkey\'s non-permament </p><p>term on the IAEA Board will expire in 2003 and that Ankara </p><p>hopes the USG will continue to share as much information </p><p>about Iran\'s nuclear efforts as it can. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
