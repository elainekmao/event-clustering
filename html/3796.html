REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Once dismissed as another hollow </p><p>threat by a feckless National Assembly, the ongoing </p><p>impeachment drama is now the central political issue </p><p>in Nigeria, eclipsing even voter registration. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s removal from office remains unlikely </p><p>however the odds against him are stronger than last </p><p>month when the impeachment threat was first issued. </p><p>With many in the once pro-Obasanjo Senate allying with </p><p>the President\'s foes in the Lower House, the plot has </p><p>developed into a serious effort to derail Obasanjo\'s </p><p>quest for a second term. The aim of most Assembly </p><p>Members is not Obasanjo\'s immediate removal from </p><p>office but to weaken him so that he drops his </p><p>reelection bid or fails at the PDP convention. At </p><p>first slow to respond, Obasanjo has begun some catch- </p><p>up politicking to solidify his remaining support. </p><p>Still, members of his staff privately worry the threat </p><p>cannot be easily extinguished because powerful anti- </p><p>Obasanjo interests are behind the effort. Legislators </p><p>claim good faith guides them but their critics assert </p><p>they are after Obasanjo because he opposes their </p><p>reelections and thus refused to fund "constituency </p><p>projects" Assembly incumbents had sought to bolster </p><p>their electoral prospects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary Cont: Concerned the National Assembly </p><p>did not fully appreciate the effect its move would </p><p>have on Nigeria\'s political stability, traditional </p><p>rulers, state governors, and religious leaders have </p><p>waded into the maelstrom, attempting to reconcile the </p><p>two sides, to little avail thus far. The impeachment </p><p>saga has brought the ethnic electoral battlements into </p><p>sharper focus. Almost all leaders from the Southwest </p><p>oppose impeachment while many Northern politicians </p><p>support the move, an ironic role reversal from the </p><p>1999 election in which Obasanjo\'s support base was the </p><p>North with the Southwest voting overwhelmingly for the </p><p>opposition. Clearly, the impeachment drama has </p><p>increased political tensions. A quick resolution where </p><p>Obasanjo acknowledges the need for a working </p><p>partnership with the National Assembly and the </p><p>Assembly drops the impeachment threat is in Nigeria\'s </p><p>best interests. This will require a spirit of </p><p>compromise heretofore lacking, particularly in the </p><p>Assembly. If this crisis continues, it will only </p><p>reinforce the zero-sum mentality that shapes too much </p><p>of political conduct in Nigeria. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>PRESIDENT VS HOUSE -- TRYING TO UNBALANCE THE OTHER </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The impeachment crisis primarily is the result </p><p>of four factors: 1) Obasanjo\'s unpopularity and </p><p>truncating political strength, 2) Assembly Members\' </p><p>own electoral uncertainties, 3) Obasanjo\'s </p><p>unwillingness to implement politically popular deficit </p><p>spending on capital projects, and 4) Three and one- </p><p>half years of feuding and acrimony between the </p><p>President and the National Assembly, particularly the </p><p>House. There have been previous impeachment threats </p><p>against the President, each easily defused through a </p><p>combination of presidential cajolery, intimidation and </p><p>horse-trading, with some money changing hands as well. </p><p>These prior attempts were tactical designs to show </p><p>displeasure with the President\'s cursory treatment of </p><p>the National Assembly and to extract a few concessions </p><p>from him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The current impeachment saga also revolves </p><p>around money, but the stakes are higher. The </p><p>impeachment threat has graduated from an avenue to </p><p>gain lucre to a zero-sum electoral survival strategy </p><p>pitting the President against the National Assembly. </p><p>Thus, the price for ending this challenge will be more </p><p>costly and politically more labor intensive than the </p><p>resolutions that came before. It all boils down to </p><p>timing. With elections over the horizon, many National </p><p>Assembly members are struggling for their political </p><p>lives and sense President Obasanjo opposes their </p><p>reelection.  In some cases, he has even worked within </p><p>the party to stifle their re-election bids; this is a </p><p>reason that the strongest advocates of impeachment </p><p>come from the President\'s own party. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Viewing the President\'s actions through their </p><p>narrow electoral optic, Assembly members did not see </p><p>Obasanjo\'s refusal to finance budget-busting capital </p><p>projects as fiscal virtue; they saw the refusal as a </p><p>betrayal of the President\'s earlier pledge to funds </p><p>such projects and as a mortal blow to their reelection </p><p>strategies. Many of these Assembly Members correctly </p><p>sensed that Obasanjo\'s image was tarnished and his </p><p>armor had serious chinks: he is neither as strong nor </p><p>as popular as even one year ago. The best defense </p><p>against the attack of a weakened opponent is the </p><p>counterattack, they figured. Members claimed concerned </p><p>that Obasanjo\'s unpopularity would further diminish </p><p>their reelection chances should they be forced to </p><p>campaign with him on the party ticket. Thus, Assembly </p><p>Members came to view impeachment not as a means of </p><p>upholding the constitution but as a fight for their </p><p>political lives.  In the Members\' zero sum world, </p><p>Obasanjo\'s political survival equals their political </p><p>extinction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Because this is an election year and the </p><p>topography of the electoral playing field is at stake, </p><p>many influential and would be influential actors are </p><p>now interested in the National Assembly\'s battles with </p><p>the President. They are stoking the National </p><p>Assembly\'s ardor from behind the scenes. These players </p><p>are not champions of the National Assembly and largely </p><p>indifferent whether Obasanjo violated the </p><p>constitution. They are students of Machiavelli whose </p><p>political calculations will be maximized if Obasanjo </p><p>is further weakened or knocked out of the picture. </p><p>With Obasanjo sidelined, the playing field opens up. </p><p>These real and ersatz king-makers could then advance a </p><p>malleable presidential ticket more to their liking. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Overestimating his own personal authority and </p><p>popularity as well as being inured by the prior </p><p>impeachment tempests that quickly receded, Obasanjo </p><p>was slow to recognize the severity underlying the </p><p>current threat. Underestimating the disruptive role an </p><p>incensed, unified and somewhat desperate House could </p><p>play, he waited several weeks before moving to protect </p><p>his flank. Once aware of the danger, he has conferred </p><p>several times with governors and other opinion leaders </p><p>from various parts of the country, including key </p><p>traditional rulers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) He has also taken a carrot and stick approach </p><p>to the National Assembly. Wielding the hard wood, the </p><p>Presidency iterated the months-old threat of auditing </p><p>the Assembly\'s finances. A pro-Obasanjo House Member </p><p>petitioned the ICPC (anti-corruption commission) to </p><p>investigate implacable Obasanjo foe, House Speaker </p><p>Ghali Na\'Abba. The petition against Na\'Abba has some </p><p>traction, with the ICPC determining that the </p><p>allegations are plausible and that the Speaker must </p><p>respond. He is scheduled for questioning on September </p><p>24 but has also filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the </p><p>ICPC investigation. Further, there are credible </p><p>reports that Obasanjo is also trying to dislodge </p><p>Senate President Anyim from his leadership of the </p><p>upper Chamber. (Comment: If rumors are true, Na\'Abba </p><p>may have cause to worry.  He reportedly is a liberal </p><p>spender who has dipped into House coffers to reward </p><p>and maintain support within and beyond the House. He </p><p>also has been accused of unwarranted spending in order </p><p>to maintain the pomp and surroundings he feels befit </p><p>his high office. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Dangling the carrot, Obasanjo recently sent a </p><p>supplemental budget to the House releasing funds for </p><p>"constituency projects," the very type the lawmakers </p><p>clamored for prior to their impeachment threat. To </p><p>shore Obasanjo\'s image with the public, the government </p><p>released civil servant back salaries for July and </p><p>August.  He has also forwarded a bill to the Assembly </p><p>that would resolve the highly contentious oil resource </p><p>allocation dispute by eliminating the offshore/onshore </p><p>dichotomy currently on the books.  This would restore </p><p>the revenue stream to South-South states, increasing </p><p>his stock in that key area and making it  difficult </p><p>for the region\'s Assembly Members to vote against him. </p><p>He also reached a widely publicized agreement with the </p><p>National Labor Congress for a 12.5 percent pay raise </p><p>to begin next year.  Now, organized labor should want </p><p>to keep him around to honor this personal pledge. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Behind the scenes, Obasanjo spoke with </p><p>potential rival and former military Head of State </p><p>Ibrahim Babangida. According to a Babangida ally, </p><p>Babangida was deeply annoyed that Obasanjo summoned </p><p>him from Minna to Abuja only to accuse him of funding </p><p>the impeachment threat. Babangida\'s annoyance grew </p><p>when Obasanjo switched from tendering accusations to </p><p>entreating him to talk to rebellious House members. </p><p>Babangida reportedly told Obasanjo that it was the </p><p>President\'s responsibility to visit he House and break </p><p>bread with its leadership; he should not deploy </p><p>emissaries to conduct his bidding.  Since this August </p><p>encounter, Babangida has made a few characteristically </p><p>nebulous public comments, the latest being that this </p><p>Executive-Legislative standoff was a healthy sign for </p><p>Nigeria\'s young democracy. (Comment: Both the French </p><p>Ambassador and British Deputy High Commissioner have </p><p>told Ambassador Jeter that the President\'s political </p><p>advisors continue to lament that Babangida is </p><p>directing the impeachment drive and that they are at a </p><p>loss as to stopping him. End Comment) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>TRADITIONAL LEADERS AND THE PDP -- CAN THEY FIX IT? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) Obasanjo\'s appeal for support apparently fared </p><p>better with the traditional rulers than with the </p><p>former military Head of State. The Emir of Kano, one </p><p>of the North\'s two most influential rulers, made </p><p>statements opposing the impeachment. Recently, a group </p><p>of Nigeria\'s most respected traditional rulers </p><p>gathered in Abuja.  Emerging from three days of </p><p>marathon sessions, the Ooni of Ife told Ambassador </p><p>Jeter that the rulers have reconciled the sides and </p><p>that the impeachment threat soon would fizzle. </p><p>(Comment. The preeminent Yoruba traditional leader, </p><p>the Ooni did not give the Ambassador details of the </p><p>alleged workout. The Ooni is a savvy veteran of the </p><p>Nigerian political trenches whose insider information </p><p>cannot be discounted; however, but he could be looking </p><p>at this through a decidedly pro-Obasanjo, Yoruba </p><p>prism. In any event, he told the Ambassador that the </p><p>ongoing move against Obasanjo was "all about money and </p><p>graft." Traditional rulers, he said, would not let </p><p>that happen. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Given that the impetus for the impeachment </p><p>comes from PDP Assembly Members, the party\'s national </p><p>leadership has also the tried to reconcile what have </p><p>become the Presidential and Legislative factions of </p><p>the party.  Thus far, these efforts have not born </p><p>visible fruit. Most Governors have also sided with </p><p>Obasanjo on this issue, some fearing the unwanted cue </p><p>their State Assemblies could take from this federal </p><p>episode; but the Governors can little influence the </p><p>Assembly. Assembly Members, particularly, Senators, </p><p>warily view their State\'s Executives, believing (often </p><p>accurately) the President and Governors are conspiring </p><p>to keep them from being reelected. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (C) Meanwhile, many groups and organizations have </p><p>added their respective wisdom or lack thereof to the </p><p>debate. How Nigerians view impeachment has largely </p><p>been a measure of whether or not they support </p><p>Obasanjo. Thus, with the exception of human rights </p><p>lawyer Gani Fawahenmi who offered pro bono legal </p><p>services to help the House against Obasanjo, the </p><p>strongest criticism of the impeachment has arisen from </p><p>the Yoruba Southwest, Obasanjo\'s ethnic home. Much of </p><p>the North and particularly members of the influential </p><p>Arewa Consultative Forum, whose opposition to Obasanjo </p><p>needs little introduction, have praised the House for </p><p>obeying its duty of protecting the country and the </p><p>constitution from Presidential arrogation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) No one has been able to bridge the differences </p><p>between the President and National Assembly </p><p>leadership, particularly Speaker Na\'Abba and more </p><p>recently Senate President Anyim. One of the problems </p><p>has been the propensity of both sides to talk </p><p>moderately in private but let rhetorical excess get </p><p>the better of their public statements.  A few days </p><p>after a conciliatory private session with House </p><p>Members, Obasanjo publicly lambasted the effort </p><p>against him as a joke run amok and belittled the </p><p>Members as "jokers." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (C) Many House members were not in a joking mood </p><p>after Obasanjo\'s remarks.  For them, Obasanjo\'s </p><p>stinging remarks came as a surprise after their </p><p>private session, obliterating any goodwill he wanted </p><p>to build. For a growing number, both Obasanjo\'s biting </p><p>comments and his conciliatory overtures were </p><p>immaterial. For this expanding circle of PDP hard- </p><p>liners, the Rubicon was passed the day they published </p><p>the seventeen charges against Obasanjo.  Members of </p><p>the opposition ANPP support the impeachment efforts </p><p>because fits their party\'s interests and because there </p><p>so no downside for them individually. Many members of </p><p>the Southwest-dominated AD oppose the impeachment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) House Spokesman, Rep. Farouk Lawan, announced </p><p>last week that 200 members had signed the 17-point </p><p>list of accusations against the President, with a goal </p><p>of 300 signatures. Lawan said that the House would be </p><p>prepared to pass the list of charges to the Senate by </p><p>September 20. (NOTE:  157 signatures are required to </p><p>initiate the procedure.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (C) While formal transmission of the House charges </p><p>to the Senate is still pending, the Senate is already </p><p>is on stage and involved in the drama. Most likely the </p><p>House would not have embarked on this collision course </p><p>with the President unless assured of support by Senate </p><p>President Anyim, once a close presidential ally.  A </p><p>few months ago, Obasanjo jeopardized his "governance </p><p>strategy" of maintaining a divided National Assembly </p><p>to advance an "electoral strategy" of allegiance with </p><p>State governors. Anyim and the Ebonyi State Governor </p><p>Sam Egwu were battling for control of the State PDP </p><p>apparatus.  Obasanjo characteristically sided with the </p><p>Governor, and Anyim fell out with Obasanjo. Since </p><p>then, the Senate President has moved progressively </p><p>closer to Obasanjo nemesis, House Speaker Na\'Abba. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18. (C) Anyim\'s feud with Egwu reflects the </p><p>adversarial relationship between many Senators and </p><p>their State Governors. In many States, Senators and </p><p>Governors have locked horns over control of the State </p><p>party machinery or who will be the next Governor. </p><p>Thus, an electoral strategy that aligns him with the </p><p>Governors has puts Obasanjo in ill humor with the </p><p>Senators. Furthering the acrimony between the </p><p>President and Senate, allies of President have been </p><p>accused of bribing Senators to oppose impeachment. </p><p>There have been media reports of Senators returning </p><p>the alleged bribes after being pressured by anti- </p><p>Obasanjo colleagues to come clean. A veteran </p><p>journalist recounted being told by Senator Jonathan </p><p>Zwingina that numerous Senators admitted to taking the </p><p>one million Naira payoffs. Nevertheless, Zwingina </p><p>claimed that most of those who accepted the bribes </p><p>would eventually vote against Obasanjo when the time </p><p>was ripe. Some claim that over 80 of the 109 Senators </p><p>now oppose Obasanjo. The Presidency has denied the </p><p>bribery charge. The Senate has established an ad hoc </p><p>committee to investigate the allegations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>OBASANJO RISES TO HIS OWN DEFENSE </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19. (U) On September 11, explicitly recognizing that </p><p>the impeachment drive had gathered unexpected </p><p>momentum, President Obasanjo issued a detailed defense </p><p>against the 17 charges brought against him. Obasanjo </p><p>explained he never deliberately violated the </p><p>constitution or used his office to enrich himself. </p><p>Obasanjo presented his response to a committee of PDP </p><p>members established to resolve this rift threatening </p><p>the basic unity of the party. Members of the PDP </p><p>committee indicated to us that they were unsatisfied </p><p>with his response.  He refused to meet us for two </p><p>weeks, one member complained.  His change of heart, </p><p>according to another, came only with the indication </p><p>that the House was moving ahead with the process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>MOMENTUM FOR IMPEACHMENT GROWING </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>20. (C) A presidential advisor recently told </p><p>Ambassador Jeter the situation was increasingly </p><p>disturbing.  While discounting a genuine legal basis </p><p>for impeachment, the advisor noted the President was </p><p>enmeshed in a political struggle, not a legal affair. </p><p>It boiled down to a matter of numbers, not </p><p>constitutionality or legality.  Although he felt </p><p>Obasanjo would survive, the advisor predicted the </p><p>impeachment drive would not end soon. He saw </p><p>influential powerbrokers at the controls of this </p><p>attack. Moreover, he claimed clear evidence of vast </p><p>sums of money changing hands to finance the </p><p>impeachment move. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) In short, the advisor maintained impeachment </p><p>was all about money and reelection not breaches of the </p><p>constitution. By not playing pork-barrel politics, </p><p>i.e. earmarking funds for "constituency projects" the </p><p>Representatives could point to garner votes in the </p><p>upcoming elections, Obasanjo was harpooning their </p><p>reelection bids.  Other Representatives knew they </p><p>would not win the party nomination again; they not </p><p>only wanted money but to extort Obasanjo into </p><p>supporting their re-nomination. Being sure losers </p><p>otherwise, they had nothing to lose by threatening </p><p>Obasanjo, There was little downside to this vindictive </p><p>misadventure, the advisor concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>22. (C) During an extended discussion at the </p><p>Ambassador\'s residence, British Deputy High </p><p>Commissioner Charles Bird stated that venality and </p><p>personal electoral considerations of House members, </p><p>not conscience, were the authors of the move to oust </p><p>Obasanjo.  Like us, Bird felt the impeachment </p><p>initially was intended to weaken Obasanjo politically </p><p>and perhaps dissuade him from seeking the PDP re- </p><p>nomination. However, he claimed, the longer the threat </p><p>hovered, the more it assumed a life of its own.  Now, </p><p>it has an independent momentum.  Many members of the </p><p>House were now seized by the prospect of toppling </p><p>Obasanjo, rendering this the most serious of the </p><p>several impeachment threats Obasanjo has faced and the </p><p>most serious legislative challenge to the primacy of </p><p>the Executive since the 1999 return of civilian rule. </p><p>After the dust has settled, there would likely be a </p><p>tectonic shift in the power relationship between the </p><p>Executive and the Legislature, Bird thought.  Either a </p><p>strengthened Legislature would achieve par with a </p><p>weakened Presidency or the current situation of a </p><p>powerful Presidency and a laconic Assembly would be </p><p>reinforced, he contended. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>23. (C) What Bird did not say was that if Obasanjo </p><p>should ultimately surrendered to the demands of a </p><p>rent-seeking legislature, corruption and graft will </p><p>have carried the day. However, if Obasanjo prevails, </p><p>his antagonists in both Chambers will quickly become </p><p>political relics in 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>VICE PRESIDENT ATIKU -- THE PASSIVE BENEFICIARY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>24. (C) VP Atiku is the primary beneficiary of the </p><p>impeachment drama. Initially, Atiku was being fingered </p><p>as the hand behind the scenes; that charge has not </p><p>stuck, with Obasanjo\'s people increasingly seeing </p><p>Babangida as the culprit. Nursing strong presidential </p><p>ambitions of his own, Atiku can watch passively from </p><p>the sidelines as the Assembly seeks to destroy </p><p>Obasanjo. Because their relationship has cooled, Atiku </p><p>longer feels impelled to energetically support </p><p>Obasanjo.  Given Atiku\'s power within the party and </p><p>his popularity within the National Assembly, his </p><p>active support might have helped defuse the standoff. </p><p>However, Atiku knows he is next in line should </p><p>Obasanjo fall. Even if he survives, Obasanjo would be </p><p>too weak to fire Atiku as his running mate.  Moreover, </p><p>Obasanjo might be injured to the extent that Atiku </p><p>could risk challenging him for the PDP nomination. </p><p>Thus, Atiku seems content to let others do the </p><p>fighting while he positions himself to take advantage </p><p>of whatever unfolds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>25. (C) Like most political phenomena, impeachment is </p><p>subjective; its propriety lies in the eye of the </p><p>beholder. Those who support Obasanjo, decry the </p><p>impeachment; those who decry Obasanjo, generally </p><p>support the impeachment. Despite their protestations </p><p>to the contrary, the legislators\' motives are suspect. </p><p>What started the process was Obasanjo\'s reluctance to </p><p>open the government coffers so  House members could </p><p>spread largesse come election time. Objectively, </p><p>perhaps the most serious allegation against the </p><p>President is his role in doctoring the 2001 electoral </p><p>law.  This indiscretion is included in the bill of </p><p>particulars against the President but the House has </p><p>not focussed much attention on this charge. The </p><p>inattention is partially because some Senate and House </p><p>leaders were accomplices in this misdeed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>26. (C) House leaders claim over 200 Members have </p><p>signed the petition; only 157 signatures are needed to </p><p>initiate formal impeachment process. Two weeks after </p><p>the process is initiated, the constitution requires a </p><p>two-thirds vote of both Houses to advance the process </p><p>to a three-month investigation followed by another </p><p>two-thirds vote in both chambers if the investigation </p><p>supports the charges. It is still unlikely the pro- </p><p>impeachment forces can must two separate super- </p><p>majorities in both Houses. If they start the process </p><p>but do not garner enough votes, their threat vanishes </p><p>completely in two weeks. Obasanjo, while crippled, </p><p>would have his pyrrhic victory and could begin to lick </p><p>his wounds. By temporizing, they can keep the shadow </p><p>of uncertainty over Obasanjo until the PDP convention. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>27. (C) By sustaining this threat over Obasanjo, </p><p>however, the House is steering Nigeria into a period </p><p>of deepening political instability at a time when </p><p>"normal electoral preparations" provide more than </p><p>enough anxiety. Nigeria would be best served by a </p><p>quick resolution where the President acknowledges his </p><p>"mistakes" and recognizes the need to have a strong </p><p>partnership with the legislature, thereby bolstering </p><p>the role of the Assembly and the principle of checks </p><p>and balances. In exchange, the legislators would agree </p><p>to bury the impeachment hatchet and let Obasanjo\'s </p><p>fate be decided at the party convention or by the </p><p>electorate. If so, the politicians would have </p><p>succeeded in snatching an important victory from the </p><p>jowls of this crisis. Since Obasanjo\'s opponents would </p><p>feel no compunction about rigging an election, they </p><p>also believe that he is unhindered by any moral </p><p>restraint about cheating (for himself or against </p><p>them). Because both sides mistrust each other, </p><p>conditions do not favor a statesmanlike compromise, </p><p>unfortunately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>28. (C) Since 1999, Nigeria has experienced too many </p><p>impeachment threats against the President and too much </p><p>presidential interference with the inner workings of </p><p>the National Assembly. These confrontations are </p><p>indicative of the inexperience and fragility of </p><p>Nigeria\'s democratic process, with one branch of </p><p>government jockeying to dominate the other. Thus, </p><p>should this crisis linger and deteriorate, it would </p><p>reinforce the belief that political differences are </p><p>not to be resolved by compromise but by marginalizing </p><p>and even removing opponents from office.  The harmful, </p><p>zero-sum nature of Nigerian politics would persist, </p><p>further impeding the country\'s democratic development. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
