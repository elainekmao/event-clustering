(U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Following the U.S. detention of Turkish special </p><p>forces in </p><p>northern Iraq, the GOT closed the lone Turkey - Iraq  border </p><p>crossing at </p><p>Habur to U.S. contractors.  UN traffic has also been </p><p>impacted.  Kellogg, </p><p>Brown and Root\'s (KBR\'s) representative in Adana told us that </p><p>the border </p><p>closed to KBR shipments into Iraq as of 18:00 on July 4, </p><p>though the GOT </p><p>is allowing empty trucks with Turkish drivers to return to </p><p>Turkey.  KBR </p><p>stopped loading benzine and LPG on July 5.  About 1000 trucks </p><p>are now </p><p>idling, and another 200 to 300 are loaded with benzine and </p><p>LPG and </p><p>waiting at the border for permission to cross.  KBR told us </p><p>that Baghdad </p><p>is out of LPG, though the situation is not as dire for </p><p>benzine.  The </p><p>World Food Program\'s (WFP) Ankara representative told us that </p><p>the border </p><p>is not formally closed to humanitarian aid shipments, but the </p><p>flow has </p><p>slowed dramatically to 20 to 30 trucks daily.  Empty trucks </p><p>are being </p><p>permitted to cross back into Turkey.  WFP has not stopped </p><p>loading its </p><p>trucks, but might take this step on July 7, as it is </p><p>concerned about </p><p>possible demurrage charges by Turkish trucking companies. </p><p>WFP advised </p><p>that it plans to raise these issues with the Turkish MFA at a </p><p>meeting </p><p>scheduled for July 7. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
