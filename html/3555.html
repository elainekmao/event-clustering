(U) This message highligts significant events in the </p><p>Maoist insurgency since July.  On August 21 the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) attacked a Maoist training camp in Rolpa, </p><p>reportedly killing 30 insurgents.  Maoists continue to attack </p><p>civilians and rural infrastructure, but staged no large-scale </p><p>attacks on RNA or police during the period.  Pledging to </p><p>disrupt national elections in November, the insurgents have </p><p>begun a campaign of threats and intimidation in some areas. </p><p>The Government of India continues its cooperation in cracking </p><p>down on Maoists believed to be operating in its territory. </p><p>Interpol issued an international alert on several wanted </p><p>Maoists.  On August 19 a member of the Maoists\' Joint </p><p>Revolutionary Council surrendered to the National Human </p><p>Rights Commission.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>RNA OFFENSIVE IN ROLPA </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Acting on intelligence in the largest offensive </p><p>engagement since an attack on a Maoist training camp in </p><p>Salyan on June 12 (Ref A), on August 21 the Royal Nepal Army </p><p>(RNA) attacked a Maoist base in Thawang, Rolpa--the heartland </p><p>of the insurgency--with two company-sized units </p><p>(approximately 300 soldiers).  According to initial reports, </p><p>the RNA suffered one soldier killed in action and three </p><p>wounded.  At least 30 Maoists were reported killed, and five </p><p>Enfield 303 rifles and large quantities of rice were </p><p>recovered from the site.  From July 1 to August 22, 2002, the </p><p>Ministry of Defense reports a total of 193 Maoists killed by </p><p>security forces. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>MAOIST ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN TARGETS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Although the Maoists have not staged any large-scale </p><p>attacks on the security forces since May, the insurgents\' </p><p>campaign against civilian targets continues.  Most observers </p><p>expect the level of violence to increase as September 16--the </p><p>date of a Maoist-proclaimed general strike--approaches (Ref </p><p>C).  Maoists reportedly have killed at least 18 civilians </p><p>during the period, including three teachers, one newspaper </p><p>editor, and 10 mainstream party activists.  On July 10 a </p><p>horde of several hundred Maoists attacked a village in </p><p>southwestern Nepal, killing two men suspected of being </p><p>informants and beating other villagers with iron rods. On </p><p>August 1 Maoists abducted three Nepali civilians, including </p><p>an employee of the British Gurkha Welfare organization and a </p><p>radio announcer, from a bus in Rolpa.  Other passengers were </p><p>beaten and robbed.  To date, the kidnapping victims\' </p><p>whereabouts remain unknown.  On August 12 in southern Nepal </p><p>insurgents killed former Maoist Tek Bahadur Thapa Magar, who </p><p>had surrendered to the authorities.  On August 16, a band of </p><p>Maoists in western Nepal hacked to death Manohar Pratap </p><p>Malla, the son of a former minister during the Panchayat </p><p>regime.  On August 20 Maoists killed Nawaraj Sharma, editor </p><p>of a local newspaper in the mid-west district of Kalikot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) The insurgents continue violent activities within the </p><p>capital, albeit with more limited effect.  On July 5 Maoists </p><p>set off a bomb at the Prime Minister\'s Nepali Congress party </p><p>office (Ref B), injuring ten, and at a private business </p><p>college--owned by the Press Secretary for the Royal </p><p>Palace--August 8, injuring six (Ref E).  The insurgents have </p><p>also kept up their attacks on local infrastructure, destoying </p><p>the only Sanskrit school in eastern Nepal\'s Taplejung </p><p>District with a socket bomb August 12.  They disrupted </p><p>transportation between the remote northern districts of Humla </p><p>and Mugu with the destruction of a suspension bridge.  On </p><p>August 15 Maoists blew up the only power station in the </p><p>capital of far northwestern Darchula District, leaving nearly </p><p>1500 families with no electricity and crippling the local </p><p>economy. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ANTI-ELECTORAL ACTIVITIES </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  The Chief District Officers (CDO) of Pyuthan and </p><p>Gorkha Districts in Nepal\'s mid-western hill region report </p><p>Maoists have begun propagating anti-election slogans in local </p><p>villages, spreading terror among the residents.  The CDO in </p><p>Nawalaparasi District in southern Nepal reports similar </p><p>activities in the northern hilly belt of his jurisdiction. </p><p>The level of actual intimidation is undoubtedly much higher. </p><p>In the Kathmandu Valley, for example, one resident of </p><p>Lalitpur District told emboff that Maoists had visited every </p><p>household in his electoral ward to warn residents not to vote </p><p>in the November 13 national elections. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>INDIAN COOPERATION </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Critical to the Government of Nepal\'s (GON) </p><p>relative success in countering the Maoists has been </p><p>increasing and long-needed support from India, which shares </p><p>1600 km of border with Nepal (Ref D).  The Indian government </p><p>has banned the All Indian-Nepali Unity Society, an </p><p>organization affiliated with Nepali Maoists, and in July </p><p>cooperated in the arrest and extradition of nine Maoists </p><p>wanted in Nepal.  On July 10 the Indian Charge told the </p><p>Nepal-India Friendship Association that his government will </p><p>deploy members of India\'s Special Service Bureau to patrol </p><p>the border in an effort to control Maoist and other </p><p>cross-border criminal activities. On August 10 the Nepali </p><p>press reported Indian schools in some districts along the </p><p>Nepali border had been instructed not to register Nepali </p><p>students who lack GON-issued identification.  The Indians </p><p>also staged a raid on a Maoist-occupied apartment in </p><p>Darjeeling. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>INTERPOL COOPERATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  At the request of the GON, Interpol issued an </p><p>all-points bulletin against eight Maoists, including top </p><p>leaders Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai and head of the </p><p>Maoist student group Debendra Parajuli.  (The Nepali press </p><p>noted the Interpol website had inadvertently transposed </p><p>Bhattarai\'s and Prachanda\'s pictures.)  Also on the list: </p><p>Agni Sapkota, one of the insurgents\' negotiators who met with </p><p>GON representatives three times during the 2001 ceasefire. </p><p>Nepali police said they have asked Interpol to add other </p><p>names to the list, including that of the Maoists\' putative </p><p>military commander, Ram Bahadur Thapa (a.k.a. "Badal"). </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>NOTABLE SURRENDER </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Mukti Pradhan, on the GON\'s most-wanted list as a </p><p>member of the Maoists\' Joint Revolutionary Council, </p><p>surrendered to the National Human Rights Commission on August </p><p>19 (Ref F).  Pradhan\'s surrender is the first by a suspect on </p><p>the most-wanted list.  The GON had offered a USD 45,000 </p><p>reward for information leading to his arrest.  In all, the </p><p>GON reports that nearly 16,000 former Maoists have </p><p>surrendered.  (Note:  It seems likely that a good number of </p><p>those who surrendered were not armed militants but rather </p><p>former members of "people\'s governments" in areas previously </p><p>under Maoist control.  End note.)  About 5400 suspected </p><p>Maoists are reported to be in GON custody. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The general perception within the GON and among many </p><p>observers is that the Maoists, who have staged no major </p><p>action against the security forces since May, are on the </p><p>defensive.  Cooperation from neighboring India has been </p><p>particularly significant in helping the clampdown and in </p><p>ratcheting up the pressure on the insurgents\' leadership. </p><p>Most observers expect the Maoists\' small-scale attacks </p><p>against civilian targets, including bombings and possible </p><p>assassination attempts against senior government offials, to </p><p>increase in tempo as the dates of the September 16 general </p><p>strike and the November 13 national elections near.  The </p><p>Rolpa operation indicates the RNA\'s evolving ability to use </p><p>intelligence successfully and to seize the offensive from the </p><p>Maoists. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
