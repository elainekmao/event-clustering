<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001568 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S , AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: JOURNALIST\'S TRIAL POSTPONED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   The trial of "Daily News" reporter Lloyd Mudiwa </p><p>    has been postponed.  Mudiwa was charged on April 30 </p><p>    with "publishing falsehoods" because of his report </p><p>    about a woman supposedly beheaded by ruling party </p><p>    supporters.  That story has since been disproved.  On </p><p>    June 20 Mudiwa presented himself to the Harare </p><p>    Magistrates\' Court as ordered, but was told to return </p><p>    on July 22. </p><p> </p><p>2.   According to "Daily News" Assistant Editor Bill </p><p>    Saidi, the trial was postponed because the government </p><p>    decided to charge "Daily News" editor-in-chief Geoff </p><p>    Nyarota and reporter Collin Chiwanza with the same </p><p>    offense and try all three journalists at the same </p><p>    time.  The government, apparently, needs additional </p><p>    time to draw up the charges against Nyarota and </p><p>    Chiwanza. </p><p> </p><p>3.   Developing charges against Chiwanza may involve </p><p>    some interesting legal contortions.  He and Mudiwa </p><p>    were arrested together on April 30 and spent two </p><p>    nights in jail, joined by Amcit journalist Andrew </p><p>    Meldrum on May 1. Harare magistrate Lillian Kudya, </p><p>    however, withdrew the charges against Chiwanza on May </p><p>    7, stating that he "did not contribute to the initial </p><p>    false publication."  In a society in which rule of law </p><p>    prevailed, charging Chiwanza with the same offense for </p><p>    a second time would likely be seen as double jeopardy. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
