<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ACCRA 000585 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USDA PLEASE PASS FAS/ITP PSHEIKH AND EPURDY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, GH, WTO, AGRICULTURE </p><p>SUBJECT: AGRICULTURE REPS BRING MESSAGE TO GHANAIANS: SPEAK </p><p>UP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: USDA representatives met with numerous Ghanaian </p><p>officials to seek support for the US position on food aid and </p><p>market access in the WTO Agricultural Negotiations, to </p><p>highlight US efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa and to confirm </p><p>invites to the Ministerial Conference and Expo on </p><p>Agricultural Science and Technology. With the March 31 </p><p>deadline for modalities on the agriculture agreement, USG </p><p>officials urged the Ghanaians to move on these issues before </p><p>time runs out. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. Patricia Sheikh, Deputy Administrator of International </p><p>Trade Policy at the USDA, Emiko Purdy and Joseph Lopez, </p><p>International Trade Policy economists and Jamie Rothschild, </p><p>the Regional Foreign Agricultural Service Officer, held </p><p>bilateral discussions with GoG officials in Accra on March </p><p>17. The session was opened by Deputy Minister of Agriculture </p><p>Dr. M.K. Antwi, who stated that Ghana needed to be allowed </p><p>further access to outside markets. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>WTO Negotiations </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. Sheikh, Purdy and Lopez were focused on delivering the USG </p><p>message on current WTO Agricultural Negotiations, </p><p>specifically, concerning the strengthening of the modalities </p><p>proposed by Stuart Harbinson, the chair of the agricultural </p><p>negotiations. Ghana has not stated its position on food aid. </p><p>Patricia Sheikh suggested that as a recipient of food aid, </p><p>Ghana should use its influence in the Africa group to support </p><p>the US suggestion that non-governmental organizations and </p><p>legitimate government-to-government food aid be allowed to </p><p>continue. Essentially, if Ghana derives some benefit from </p><p>food aid, its WTO representative should speak up in support </p><p>of food aid. Sheikh carefully pointed out that the US </p><p>supports preventing food aid from displacing commercial sales </p><p>and disrupting local production. However, the experts in Rome </p><p>at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United </p><p>Nations are those best equipped to determine whether and what </p><p>kind of food aid is market-distorting, not the WTO. Ghanaian </p><p>officials appeared seized by the idea and promised to </p><p>carefully consider the US position on the issue. </p><p> </p><p>4. Harmonization is key to the US position on domestic </p><p>support and market access and the Harbinson text is not </p><p>ambitious enough. Too much trade distorting domestic support </p><p>is allowed for many countries (i.e. the EU) and the tariff </p><p>reduction formula does not address the high protection levels </p><p>of tariffs. Domestic supports reduction should be reworked to </p><p>address the serious disparity between the EU and the rest of </p><p>the world. Regarding tariff rediction, USDA officials </p><p>supported the Swiss formula for cutting tariffs which would </p><p>bring tariffs down to no more than 25 percent. The Ghanaians, </p><p>while agreeing with the need to reduce domestic supports that </p><p>rich countries give their farmers, quickly pointed out </p><p>tariffs are the only option they have to protect their </p><p>domestic farm industry. US negotiators then pointed out that </p><p>the bottom line on the two issues is--for the US to give up </p><p>something, other countries must do their share and give up </p><p>something too. The EU must be able to move on the domestic </p><p>support issue. Poor countries should be able to move on the </p><p>tariff issue. Otherwise, negotiations will not go forward. </p><p>Ghanaian officials said they would rely on their Geneva </p><p>colleagues (one of whom was present) to provide further </p><p>guidance on the two issues. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>US Assistance </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. In response to the need expressed by the Ghanaian </p><p>contingent for assistance in improving sanitary and </p><p>phyto-sanitary regulations, Purdy pointed to the nine </p><p>regional training and information seminars that the USDA had </p><p>conducted in sub-Saharan Africa over the past two years. She </p><p>also told Ghanaian officials that an Animal and Plant Health </p><p>Inspection Service (APHIS) agent being assigned to Accra. The </p><p>agent will be a part of the West African Trade Hub and will </p><p>assist with technical assessment of agricultural products </p><p>destined to the US. USDA cautioned that the due diligence on </p><p>marketing will not be done by the APHIS agent. That, Sheikh </p><p>said, is up to the Ghanaians. Assessing their own </p><p>competitiveness on a given product should be carefully </p><p>considered when developing agricultural exports for the US </p><p>market. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Ministerial Conference </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. US Agriculture officials also clarified the schedule of </p><p>activities and logistics for the upcoming Ministerial </p><p>Conference and Expo on Agricultural Science and Technology to </p><p>be held in Sacramento June 23-25 and hosted by Agriculture </p><p>Secretary Ann Veneman. Ghanaian officials wanted further </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>details on the schedule of events in order to determine which </p><p>Ministers would derive the most benefit in attending. They </p><p>promised to inform the Embassy who will attend before the May </p><p>registration deadline. </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
