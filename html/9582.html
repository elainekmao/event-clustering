<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004613 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE E, EB/IFD AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, PREL, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S FAREWELL CALL ON STATE MINISTER </p><p>BABACAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  In a July 22 farewell call on State </p><p>Minister Ali Babacan, Ambassador noted market concerns about </p><p>delays in the IMF program and possible 2004 financing </p><p>difficulties, and stressed the need for the GOT to move </p><p>vigorously to complete the economic reform program.  He also </p><p>urged the GOT to promote the strongest possible business </p><p>links with Iraq, noting that strong commercial ties could </p><p>promote prosperity in both countries while also enhancing the </p><p>security environment.  Babacan emphasized the government\'s </p><p>commitment to the reform program.  He blamed delays in </p><p>completing the Fifth IMF Review on the legislative process, </p><p>but acknowledged that those delays -- combined with unhelpful </p><p>talk about following the Malaysia model of working without </p><p>the IMF -- had made markets nervous.  He predicted growing </p><p>market confidence into the Fall, and discounted rumors that </p><p>Turkey would need additional financing, saying Treasury\'s </p><p>debt rollover rate would actually decline significantly in </p><p>the second semester.  Babacan did not raise the issue of U.S. </p><p>financial assistance.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Ambassador paid a farewell call July 22 on State </p><p>Minister for the Treasury Ali Babacan, at the latter\'s </p><p>request.  Ambassador welcomed Turkey\'s good progress with the </p><p>IMF in recent days, but noted that interest rates remained </p><p>stubbornly high.  He asked Babacan to comment on suggestions </p><p>coming out of the Istanbul financial community that (a) the </p><p>government is taking advantage of recent market buoyancy to </p><p>slow the pace of reforms, and (b) there will be a need for </p><p>additional financing come this Fall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Babacan responded that markets had been </p><p>understandably nervous ahead of the Fourth Review, because </p><p>the government was new, the number of prior actions was </p><p>substantial, there were many disagreements between the GOT </p><p>and Fund staff, and the specter of war in Iraq made it </p><p>difficult to predict the economy\'s trajectory.   In the case </p><p>of the Fifth Review, however, there were few problems.  The </p><p>government believed in reforms, and certainly had not </p><p>intentionally delayed completion of the review.  Instead, the </p><p>delay was the result of longer-than-expected parliamentary </p><p>deliberations.  The government did not want to intrude too </p><p>aggressively into the parliamentary process, as it believed </p><p>full deliberation and debate was healthy and would bring a </p><p>sense of ownership to the Parliament.  He added that Turkey </p><p>had learned that rushing legislation -- such as the 15 laws </p><p>in 15 days under Minister Dervis -- produced "defective" </p><p>legislation that needed subsequent amendment.  (Comment:  In </p><p>fact, the delay has been the result of GOT difficulties in </p><p>agreeing to new fiscal measures, along with the slow </p><p>legislative process.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Babacan agreed, nonetheless, that the delay in </p><p>completing the review, combined with unhelpful comments about </p><p>Turkey following the Malaysian model (i.e. not working with </p><p>the IMF) had rattled the markets, which had prevented </p><p>interest rates from falling as fast as he had hoped.  Looking </p><p>forward, however, he predicted market confidence would </p><p>increase as the GOT moved ahead with the reform program. </p><p>Ambassador asked if that meant the GOT would complete the </p><p>Sixth and subsequent reviews more quickly; Babacan replied "I </p><p>guess so." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Babacan also discounted concerns about future </p><p>financing. saying he saw no reasons for the markets to be </p><p>nervous.  He pointed out that the GOT and IMF had done a </p><p>series of financial projections during recent discussions, </p><p>and saw no financing gap going forward.  In fact, the </p><p>government expects to reduce its domestic debt rollover rate </p><p>from 96 percent (for the first half of 2003) to 80 percent </p><p>(in the second half).  He does not think the economy risks </p><p>overheating, as domestic demand is moderate, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) On the fiscal side, Babacan said the government has </p><p>agreed to measures to close the budget gap, projected at 0.7 </p><p>percent of GNP.  Eighty percent of the savings will come from </p><p>the expenditure side, mostly via a reduction in public </p><p>investment.  The remainder will come from the revenue side. </p><p>Babacan acknowledged that expenditures in the first semester </p><p>had been higher than expected, while the much-touted tax </p><p>amnesty had brought in considerably less than the GOT had </p><p>hoped.  Babacan indirectly chided Finance Minister Unakitan, </p><p>saying his early, rosy estimates of significant additional </p><p>revenue from the tax amnesty had led other ministers to rush </p><p>to the Prime Minister with new spending projects.  From now </p><p>on, Babacan said, the GOT will have to be very careful on the </p><p>fiscal side. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Shifting to Iraq, Ambassador argued that Turkey had </p><p>a great opportunity to build on historic and existing trade </p><p>and assistance links to build a strong commercial </p><p>relationship with the new Iraq, particularly the more stable, </p><p>prosperous north.  Already, the UN is shipping huge </p><p>quantities of food and other supplies to Iraq, and U.S. </p><p>forces there are buying millions of dollars worth of fuel and </p><p>other items from Turkey.  Unfortunately, some in Turkey were </p><p>instead alleging that the U.S. and Turkey had conflicting </p><p>security interests in Iraq, causing doubt and hesitation </p><p>among Turkish business executives.  Ambassador urged Babacan </p><p>to work within the government in favor of an aggressive, </p><p>business-oriented approach that would build prosperity on </p><p>both sides of the border, which in turn would promote </p><p>Turkey\'s security.  Babacan agreed, and suggested that </p><p>government needed only to stay out of the way of Turkish </p><p>businessmen, removing any obstacles to trade and investment. </p><p>Ambassador rejoined that a neutral government approach </p><p>probably would not be sufficient; Turkey needed to actively </p><p>promote full economic and commercial ties with the new Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Of note, Minister Babacan did not raise the issue </p><p>of U.S. financial assistance to Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
