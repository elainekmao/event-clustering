<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004246 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/10/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: COMPOSITION OF NEW JORDANIAN PARLIAMENT, </p><p>ALLEGATIONS OF IRREGULARITIES AND POST-ELECTION CLASHES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (B)&(D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) The new Jordanian Parliament elected June 17 is </p><p>better-educated and somewhat younger than its predecessor, </p><p>and includes a large number of former ministers, lawyers, </p><p>engineers and medical doctors.  PolOff has been meeting with </p><p>newly elected MPs and political analysts to discuss their </p><p>views -- ranging from optimism to cynicism -- about the </p><p>elections and the incoming Parliament.  Reports of election </p><p>irregularities, as well as stories of clashes between </p><p>supporters of losing candidates and security forces, have </p><p>generated continued public attention to the electoral process </p><p>and the upcoming legislative session.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>THE NEW PARLIAMENT ) A NEW BREED OR MORE OF THE SAME? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) King Abdullah has scheduled a special session of the </p><p>newly elected Parliament to convene on July 15, although the </p><p>official opening of the regular session will not occur until </p><p>the fall.  The members of this new Parliament are, overall, </p><p>more educated and younger than members of previous </p><p>Parliaments.  The 110 deputies in the lower house include 10 </p><p>former ministers, 12 lawyers, 12 medical doctors, 12 retired </p><p>army officers, and 12 engineers.  Ten of the new MPs hold </p><p>PhDs, while ten more have earned Master\'s degrees and another </p><p>21 hold Bachelor\'s degrees. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Despite the improved educational credentials, </p><p>political analyst Jamal Refai and new parliamentarian Raed </p><p>Qaqish expressed to PolOff concern about the Parliament\'s </p><p>willingness to effect change and to discuss new ideas to </p><p>address Jordan\'s economic and social problems. </p><p>Interestingly, PolOff had met with Qaqish a few days prior to </p><p>the election and was impressed with his enthusiasm and zeal </p><p>for becoming an MP and tackling Jordan\'s ills.  Since the </p><p>elections, however, Qaqish had become discouraged and </p><p>disappointed at what he described as a group of MPs that is </p><p>only interested in the perks of the position and the prestige </p><p>associated with it.  Although he had made a strong effort to </p><p>meet with his counterparts and share his ideas, Qaqish said </p><p>he discovered that his innovative agenda faced an uphill </p><p>battle in a Parliament where two-thirds of the seats were won </p><p>by tribal and pro-government independent figures. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Similarly, at a luncheon hosted by the CAO for leading </p><p>journalists, participants described the new MPs as an </p><p>unfocused group with disparate interests and, with the </p><p>notable exception of the Islamic Action Front (IAF), no clear </p><p>agenda or goals.  They further noted the lack of expertise </p><p>needed to deal with complicated legislative issues, and the </p><p>shortage of parliamentary resources such as knowledgeable </p><p>staffers and research services. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) On a more positive note, MP and former lower house </p><p>speaker Saad Heil Srour told PolCouns that he was pleased </p><p>with the youth, education, and energy he has noticed in the </p><p>newly elected deputies with whom he has spoken in the last </p><p>week.  Several &young8 and/or female MPs had impressed him </p><p>in particular, and he believed they would bring new life to </p><p>the Parliament.  Several new, younger and Western-educated </p><p>MPs attended the official July 4th celebration and expressed </p><p>a desire to support an active reform agenda in Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>ELECTION IRREGULARITIES OR SOUR GRAPES? </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Jordan\'s three main newspapers reported that as of the </p><p>July 2 deadline to contest the results of the June 17 polls, </p><p>54 complaints were filed pending review by the newly elected </p><p>Parliament.  Among the main complaints are allegations of </p><p>vote buying by individual candidates, persons voting more </p><p>than once by ironing out the star-shaped mark stamped on all </p><p>voter ID cards, and voters using ID cards without district </p><p>stamps (anyone holding a card without designation of a </p><p>district number -- a replacement for a "lost" card -- was </p><p>ineligible to vote).  Embassy contact Sheikh Hamad Abu Zeid, </p><p>running in Amman\'s fourth district, recounted how two ballot </p><p>boxes allegedly appeared at the central election center </p><p>stuffed with voter ballots.  (Comment: Given that under the </p><p>electoral regulations all ballots should have been counted at </p><p>polling places in the presence of candidates\' </p><p>representatives, this should be a fairly easy allegation to </p><p>verify or disprove.  End comment) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Some losing candidates told PolOff that they would not </p><p>"waste their time" filing a complaint since the newly elected </p><p>Parliament, which is charged with reviewing all such </p><p>complaints, has a vested interest in legitimizing the </p><p>results.  They argued that an independent review committee </p><p>should be formed before the next elections in 2007 to give </p><p>the electoral process an acceptable level of credibility and </p><p>independence. </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>POST ELECTION CLASHES </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Al Arab al Yawm reported on June 20 that supporters of </p><p>unsuccessful candidates had clashed with public security </p><p>forces in the area of Na\'ur -- between Amman and the Dead Sea </p><p>) with crowds firing guns into the air, setting fire to </p><p>garbage containers, vehicles and shops, and damaging water </p><p>tanks.  As a result, the road leading to the Jordan Valley </p><p>was temporarily closed.  (Note: The road closure forced the </p><p>motorcade of Secretary Powell, which was driving from the </p><p>airport to the World Economic Forum, to divert to an </p><p>alternate route.) </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The Amman Governor imposed a curfew and sought the </p><p>assistance of local candidates and community leaders to </p><p>restore law and order.  Embassy contacts also reported that </p><p>the protests and vandalism that occurred in the Na\'ur area </p><p>were primarily directed at the local Palestinian origin </p><p>population.  Supporters of a losing tribal candidate </p><p>reportedly blamed the Palestinian community for backing the </p><p>victorious candidate -- from another tribe with ties to the </p><p>South.  In the northern governorate of Irbid, protesters </p><p>clashed with governorate employees requiring the intervention </p><p>of riot police and resulting in the arrest of 20 individuals. </p><p> Scant coverage of these events appeared in the press and </p><p>Jordan TV has ignored them altogether. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) With the exception of the allegation of two "new" </p><p>ballot boxes appearing in one district, we tend to discount </p><p>allegations of large-scale voting abuse as sour grapes. </p><p>Embassy and other diplomats who observed the polling saw no </p><p>evidence of such abuses and, in fact, saw several instances </p><p>in which election officials blocked attempts at voting fraud. </p><p> Nevertheless, widespread coverage of the allegations may </p><p>cause a skeptical public to closely scrutinize the new </p><p>Parliament. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) The post-election clashes are disturbing, but were </p><p>caused by local politics and tribal rivalries. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
