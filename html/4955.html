<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000014 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INR/R/MR </p><p>INFO AF/PDPA DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS; AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: HIV/AIDS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Why the world watches as Africans die </p><p>      of Aids" the independent "Daily News" dedicated its January </p><p>      4 editorial to urging African leaders to be at the </p><p>      forefront in the fight against the HIV/Aids pandemic in </p><p>      their countries.  Using Uganda as an example, the editorial </p><p>      underscored the importance of a collective approach to </p><p>      solving a problem, saying: "If people are united, if they </p><p>      all appreciate the enormity of their problem and how only </p><p>      unity can vanquish it, the chances of success are enhanced </p><p>      a thousand-fold."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "Stephen Lewis, the United Nations Secretary-General\'s </p><p>      Special Envoy on HIV/Aids, has recently condemned the </p><p>      international community for watching while Africans die of </p><p>      HIV/Aids.   He has compared the world\'s lack of enthusiasm </p><p>      to help Africa with vital but inexpensive drugs to </p><p>      alleviate the scourge to its readiness to finance a large- </p><p>      scale invasion of Iraq.  While Lewis displays the sort of </p><p>      sympathy for the continent that gives some African leaders </p><p>      grist for their criticism of the evils of globalization, he </p><p>      could be accused of taking a rather simplistic position. </p><p>      Africa\'s begging bowl has become an almost permanent </p><p>      appendage of its image. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   "The continent is the worst affected by the HIV/Aids </p><p>      pandemic, yet most of its governments evince little </p><p>      of the desperation that made Yoweri Museveni\'s </p><p>      government in Uganda act so decisively to engage the </p><p>      disease as if it was an alien invasion force. </p><p>      Uganda has not repelled the enemy entirely, but </p><p>      nobody in sub-Sahara Africa can argue that among the </p><p>      countries that have set an example worth emulating </p><p>      in the fight against HIV/Aids, Uganda must come near </p><p>      the top of the list.  By all accounts, foreign help, </p><p>      while it had an impact, was not the final </p><p>      determinant in the struggle.  The government and the </p><p>      people themselves recognized from the beginning that </p><p>      this was their fight and would be won only if they </p><p>      are united.  So it is with everything else in </p><p>      Africa.  If people are united, if they all </p><p>      appreciate the enormity of their problem and how </p><p>      only unity can vanquish it, then chances of success </p><p>      are enhanced a thousand-fold. </p><p> </p><p>  4.   " Against the HIV/Aids pandemic, many African </p><p>      governments stood idly while their people died </p><p>      hideous deaths. . .Lewis has toured Africa and his </p><p>      attitude has been generally sympathetic to the </p><p>      governments.  But some of this sympathy is </p><p>      misplaced: many of the governments become actively </p><p>      engaged in promoting anti-HIV/Aids programs only on </p><p>      World Aids Day in December. . .This attitude among </p><p>      African governments to seek international help with </p><p>      what are essentially their own problems has blighted </p><p>      the continent\'s relations with the donor community, </p><p>      introducing the world to donor fatigue. . .But what </p><p>      Africa needs urgently are leaders who can inspire </p><p>      their people to help themselves before they appeal </p><p>      for help from the rest of the world. . .African </p><p>      governments need to learn that freedom from </p><p>      colonialism does not automatically translate into </p><p>      freedom from poverty, hunger and disease." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
