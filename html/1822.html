<p>UNCLAS STATE 126951 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPDC, PREL, TX </p><p>SUBJECT: SECRETARY\'S LETTER TO NEW FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>1. CHARGE IS REQUESTED TO DELIVER THE LETTER IN PARA TWO </p><p>BELOW TO NEW FOREIGN MINISTER RASHID MEREDOV AT THE </p><p>EARLIEST APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY. NO SIGNED ORIGINAL WILL </p><p>FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>2. BEGIN TEXT: </p><p> </p><p>DEAR MR. MINISTER: </p><p> </p><p>MY SINCEREST CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AS </p><p>TURKMENISTAN\'S NEW FOREIGN MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>THE UNITED STATES WAS AN EARLY AND FIRM SUPPORTER OF </p><p>TURKMENISTAN\'S INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY, AND WE REMAIN </p><p>COMMITTED TO BUILDING A STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO </p><p>COUNTRIES. WE SHARE MANY INTERESTS, ESPECIALLY BUILDING </p><p>PROSPEROUS, STABLE SOCIETIES IN CENTRAL ASIA, COMBATING </p><p>NARCOTICS AND TERRORISM, AND DEVELOPING THE HYDROCARBON </p><p>RESOURCES OF THE CASPIAN REGION. IT HAD BEEN OUR BELIEF </p><p>THAT TURKMENISTAN WAS ONE OF THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS </p><p>BEST PLACED TO MAKE THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY AND TO A </p><p>MARKET ECONOMY, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS THE BEST GUARANTOR OF </p><p>STABILITY. YOUR COUNTRY IS BLESSED WITH BOTH ABUNDANT </p><p>NATURAL RESOURCES, AND HARD-WORKING, WELL-EDUCATED, </p><p>TALENTED PEOPLE. WE HAD HOPED TO HELP THAT TRANSITION AND </p><p>TO SEE OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS BECOME EVER CLOSER. WE </p><p>REGRET THAT THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE. FOR OUR PART, WE </p><p>WOULD LIKE TO TURN THIS SITUATION AROUND. </p><p> </p><p>WE BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES AND TURKMENISTAN CAN FIND </p><p>SPECIFIC AREAS OF COOPERATION THAT CAN HELP TURKMENISTAN </p><p>ACHIEVE ITS GOALS AND THAT WILL LEAD TO PRODUCTIVE </p><p>RELATIONS. AS ONE EXAMPLE, WE VIEW PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE TIES </p><p>AS A NECESSARY AND POWERFUL PRELUDE TO BROADER GOVERNMENT- </p><p>TO-GOVERNMENT TIES. OUR CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE </p><p>PROGRAMS SERVE TO INCREASE THE TURKMEN PEOPLE\'S </p><p>UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE AMERICAN </p><p>PEOPLE\'S UNDERSTANDING OF TURKMENISTAN. WE CAN ALSO </p><p>CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR ECONOMY AND YOUR </p><p>POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS BY PROVIDING NEEDED LANGUAGE AND </p><p>ECONOMIC SKILLS. </p><p> </p><p>IT IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT </p><p>PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE EXIT VISAS IN A TIMELY AND IMPARTIAL </p><p>MANNER. MORE TO THE POINT, WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF TURKMENISTAN DO AWAY WITH EXIT VISAS </p><p>ALTOGETHER. THEY ARE A LEGACY OF THE SOVIET PAST THAT </p><p>PRESENT AN IMPEDIMENT TO OUR TIES. THERE ARE MANY OTHER </p><p>MEASURES BEYOND THESE IMMEDIATE ISSUES THAT WE CAN </p><p>UNDERTAKE. I WOULD WELCOME YOUR THOUGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>IN CLOSING, I WISH YOU EVERY SUCCESS IN YOUR NEW </p><p>POSITION AND TO REITERATE UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR </p><p>TURKMENISTAN\'S INDEPENDENCE AND FOR ITS FUTURE PROSPERITY. </p><p> </p><p>SINCERELY, </p><p> </p><p>COLIN L. POWELL </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>POWELL </p><p></p></div>
