<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002259 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, PREL, ASEC, CASC, CVIS, EFIN, ETRD, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: AMMAN SITREP 36 (4/14 1700 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) FBIS GMP20030413000213 (B) FBIS </p><p>     GMP20030413000152 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Amman and the rest of Jordan is calm.  No reports of </p><p>any demonstrations anywhere in the Kingdom April 14.  Embassy </p><p>operated on a normal business schedule today.  Movements of </p><p>American personnel remain restricted.  Activities at the </p><p>American Language Center and Peace Corps offices remain </p><p>suspended. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) See para 9 below. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In an April 13 meeting with visiting UN Humanitarian </p><p>Coordinator for Iraq Ramiro Lopes de Silva, King Abdullah </p><p>affirmed the importance of the UN role in Iraq, particularly </p><p>its delivery of assistance and basic social services to the </p><p>Iraqi people.  The King indicated that Jordan is prepared to </p><p>coordinate with the UN in helping Iraq with necessary relief </p><p>supplies, and reportedly said that two Jordan army field </p><p>hospitals will soon be sent to Iraq. (Jordan Times 4/14) </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Minister of Information Muhammad al-Adwan in an April </p><p>13 statement to the Jordanian Arabic daily Al-Arab Al-Yawm </p><p>"emphasized that the government will deal with the new </p><p>administration in the interim period in Iraq in a manner that </p><p>benefits the Iraqi people."  The paper said that Al-Adwan </p><p>also stated that "the Central Bank (of Jordan) has frozen the </p><p>official Iraqi assets in licensed banks in Jordan and that </p><p>these assets would remain frozen until the situation becomes </p><p>clearer and a new Iraqi government is formed." (ref A) </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) In an April 13 statement to the official Petra News </p><p>Agency, Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Mohammad </p><p>Batayneh announced that a ship carrying 100,000 tons of Saudi </p><p>oil recently arrived in Aqaba.  (ref B) </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) No new issues. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Economic and Trade Developments </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Nasri Nowar, Director of Queen Alia International </p><p>Airport, confirmed that KLM and British Airways had resumed </p><p>service to Amman this week.  He said they would offer limited </p><p>service the next two weeks, but said that most European </p><p>carriers intended to resume normal service by the end of the </p><p>month.  Nowar added that current passenger loads were down </p><p>40% from this period last year. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  Traffic flow at the Sheikh Hussein bridge in northern </p><p>Jordan appears to be returning to normal.  Authorities at the </p><p>bridge report volumes at about one-half of normal levels for </p><p>the past two days, an improvement from the previous week. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) 108 people are being held in no-man\'s land at the </p><p>Jordanian-Iraqi border, 96 of whom are the Iranians that </p><p>arrived on April 12.  Representatives from the German embassy </p><p>are meeting with purported German document holders today; </p><p>conoff will meet with purported US document holders on April </p><p>15.  GOJ officials confirmed that the person who claimed to </p><p>be an Amcit did not possess a US passport; UNHCR separately </p><p>reported that the individual returned to Baghdad this </p><p>morning.  The additional 28-30 Iranians have not yet arrived </p><p>at the border. </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) UNHCR confirmed that nine Iraqis currently are </p><p>being held at no-man\'s land.  Some of them are laborers who </p><p>were deported on April 7 from Aqaba and subsequently returned </p><p>to the Jordanian border; others are ethnic Iraqis without any </p><p>travel documentation. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The 200 Syrian Ba\'athists and Muslim Brotherhood </p><p>supporters, rumored yesterday to be en route to the Trebil </p><p>border crossing, have not yet materialized.  UNHCR reports </p><p>that one Syrian family, carrying Iraqi passports, arrived at </p><p>the Jordanian border yesterday but were denied entry by GOJ </p><p>officials. The family was sent back into Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) UNHCR is extremely concerned about the burgeoning </p><p>population in no-man\'s land.  Although UNHCR Rep Sten Bronee </p><p>had told the press that conditions in no-man\'s land are </p><p>"squalid," UNHCR\'s senior logistics officer reports that the </p><p>space & facilities available can accommodate the current </p><p>population but would be taxed if the population reaches 200. </p><p>More importantly, UNHCR is beginning to see this as a serious </p><p>protection issue and a violation of the GOJ\'s agreements with </p><p>UNHCR.  UNHCR believes that, at a minimum, the Iranians </p><p>should be admitted to the TCN transit camp and Iraqis without </p><p>documentation who seek UNHCR protection should be allowed </p><p>into the UNHCR refugee camp.  Given GOJ views that the </p><p>Iranians are MEK members, we doubt that the GOJ will allow </p><p>any Iranians to leave the border unless they have proven </p><p>claims to residency in another country -- and are escorted by </p><p>their respective embassies to the airport.  Refcoord will </p><p>accompany conoff on the April 15 border visit and will </p><p>provide a full report on conditions. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) In the late afternoon of April 14, a number of </p><p>journalists contacted Embassy Press office reporting that a </p><p>convoy of journalists on the Amman-Baghdad highway may have </p><p>been attacked or ambushed between Ramadi and Baghdad.  The </p><p>journalists reported seeing one car apparently which had </p><p>rolled over after apparently being shot at.  Reports indicate </p><p>that one or possibly two journalists -- both of Argentinean </p><p>nationality -- may have been killed.  No further </p><p>identification was provided.  We will follow up as additional </p><p>details become available. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
