<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001806 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DRL A/S CRANER AND DWALTERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, EAID, KJUS, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: SUPPORT REQUEST FOR HUMAN RIGHTS PROSECUTOR </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 GUATEMALA 3269 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is an action request for DRL.  See para 8. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Summary:  Attorney General Carlos De Leon has requested </p><p>USG support for the Public Ministry\'s Office of the Special </p><p>Prosecutor for Crimes Against Human Rights Workers.  De Leon </p><p>cited the Public Ministry\'s resource constraints and the </p><p>critical role the Special Prosecutor\'s office is playing in </p><p>defense of human rights workers.  Thelma Pelaez De Lam, the </p><p>new Special Prosecutor, has also expressed concern that she </p><p>does not have adequate funding to achieve her mission of </p><p>bringing to justice those who threaten the lives of human </p><p>rights workers.  We consider De Lam an energetic new GOG ally </p><p>in the fight against impunity and believe providing USG </p><p>support to her office could significantly improve the climate </p><p>of human rights in Guatemala.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  At a meeting with the Ambassador on June 27, Attorney </p><p>General Carlos De Leon requested USG support for the work of </p><p>newly named "Special Prosecutor For Crimes Against Human </p><p>Rights Groups, Indigenous Groups, Civil Society and NGOs," </p><p>Thelma Pelaez Pineda De Lam.  De Leon noted that De Lam\'s </p><p>energy and courage had already led to successful </p><p>investigations and the arrest of suspects in the case of </p><p>murdered human rights activist, Manuel Garcia de La Cruz </p><p>(Reftel), and that her investigations into the murders of </p><p>three other human rights workers unveiled suspicions of </p><p>police involvement in the crimes.  De Leon said that De Lam </p><p>is exposed, and his office doesn,t even have funds to </p><p>adequately meet the equipment needs she has to carry out the </p><p>job.  He asked that the USG give consideration to providing </p><p>equipment support to her office. </p><p> </p><p>4.  In meetings with HROff on June 10 and 23, De Lam said she </p><p>had initially operated with a staff of only three until early </p><p>June when her staff jumped to 24.  However, De Lam had yet to </p><p>receive a paycheck and her staff had not been reimbursed for </p><p>investigation expenses. She lacks computers, adequate </p><p>transportation, and support from auxiliary prosecutors.  By </p><p>virtue of her sensitive position, De Lam,s security is in </p><p>jeopardy and she is regularly escorted by a three-person </p><p>security detail. </p><p> </p><p>5.  De Lam gave HROff a list of items that would aid her </p><p>office in successfully prosecuting human rights violators. </p><p>The list included:  four 4x4 vehicles in order for her to </p><p>carry out investigations simultaneously in rural areas; three </p><p>laptop computers and a printer to document and report </p><p>information while on the road and before rural tribunals; ten </p><p>desktop computers with printers for the office; and various </p><p>courses in investigations, ballistics, criminology, </p><p>pathology, crime scenes, interrogation, and others for her </p><p>team. </p><p> </p><p>6.  NAS has agreed to include De Lam\'s investigators in </p><p>training program as appropriate and USAID is also seeking </p><p>funding to support De Lam,s office. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Lack of resources impedes this key GOG office from </p><p>conducting thorough investigations, handling evidence, and </p><p>successfully prosecuting human rights violators. </p><p>Nevertheless, De Lam has indeed been making credible progress </p><p>in important investigations.  Increased funding and resources </p><p>would enable the Special Prosecutor to investigate and </p><p>prosecute more cases and thereby advance our human rights </p><p>agenda here by bringing to justice those who threaten or take </p><p>the lives of human rights defenders. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ACTION REQUEST:  Embassy requests special Department </p><p>funding to provide material support requested by De Lam in </p><p>para 5.  We estimate that at relatively low cost to the USG, </p><p>we can help the GOG achieve disproportionate results.  We </p><p>estimate that providing all the material requested would cost </p><p>$200,000.  However, lower levels of support would also </p><p>substantially add to the Special Prosecutor\'s investigative </p><p>and prosecutorial productivity. </p><p> </p><p>9.  For example, with a USG grant of $85,000, De Lam could </p><p>purchase 2 vehicles ($35,000 ea.), 3 laptops ($2000 ea.), 7 </p><p>desktop computers ($1000 ea.), 4 printers ($300 ea.), and </p><p>$800 worth of training materials and classes.  This level of </p><p>support would permit De Lam and her team to conduct </p><p>simultaneous investigations (versus the current serial </p><p>efforts she is making) in rural areas where 90% of crimes </p><p>again human rights workers take place. </p><p> </p><p>10.  A lesser grant of $45,000 would purchase one vehicle, 2 </p><p>laptops, 5 desktops, 3 printers, and leftover funds for </p><p>classes and training materials. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
