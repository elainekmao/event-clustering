IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE ZIMBABWE FOREIGN MINISTRY\'S DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>AFRICA, GODFREY MWEDZI, SPOKE TO POLOFF ON MAY 10 ABOUT </p><p>RWANDAN PRESIDENT KAGAME\'S ONE-DAY VISIT TO HARARE ON </p><p>MAY 7.  MWEDZI STATED THAT KAGAME\'S LUNCH MEETING WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS "EXCLUSIVELY BETWEEN THEM" AND DID </p><p>NOT INCLUDE ANY MINISTERS OR OTHER GOZ OFFICIALS.  ONLY </p><p>ON ONE OCCASION DID KAGAME BRIEFLY MEET WITH ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>MINISTERS.  THE ZIMBABWEAN DIPLOMAT STATED THAT </p><p>DEBRIEFINGS ON WHAT WAS DISCUSSED HAD NOT YET TRICKLED </p><p>DOWN TO HIS LEVEL (WHICH IS JUST BELOW THAT OF PERMANENT </p><p>SECRETARY).  MWEDZI STATED THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETING </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WAS CORDIAL, AND THEY SURELY DISCUSSED THE DRC, BUT IT </p><p>WOULD BE "PURE SPECULATION" ON HIS PART TO OFFER ANY </p><p>DETAILS OF THE DISCUSSION.  MWEDZI TRIED TO DOWNPLAY THE </p><p>SIGNIFICANCE OF KAGAME\'S VISIT, STATING THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p>AND RWANDA WERE NOT AT WAR, AND THEY CONTINUED TO </p><p>MAINTAIN NORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS; RWANDA DID SO </p><p>THROUGH ITS MISSION IN PRETORIA. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT: DESPITE THE DIPLOMAT\'S DOWNPLAYING, IT </p><p>IS SIGNIFICANT THAT KAGAME WOULD COME TO HARARE, HIS </p><p>FIRST PUBLIC VISIT HERE SINCE THE WAR IN THE DRC BROKE </p><p>OUT IN 1998 (KAGAME MADE A SURREPTITIOUS VISIT BROKERED </p><p>BY SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT MBEKI IN 1999).  WE CAN </p><p>SURMISE THAT KAGAME SOUGHT TO BREAK SOME OF THE ICE THAT </p><p>HAS FORMED IN THE RWANDAN-ZIMBABWEAN RELATIONSHIP, AND </p><p>ALSO TO SHOW THAT HE CAN BE A REASONABLE STATESMAN WHO </p><p>IS NOT INTERNATIONALLY ISOLATED.  IN ADDITION, KAGAME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01572  101616Z </p><p>UNDOUBTEDLY WANTED TO ENSURE THAT RWANDAN INTERESTS, </p><p>SUCH DISARMING THE INTERAHAMWE IN THE DRC, ARE TAKEN </p><p>INTO ACCOUNT BY ZIMBABWE AT THIS CRUCIAL JUNCTURE IN THE </p><p>DRC PEACE PROCESS.  NOT TO BE OUTDONE, THE UGANDANS SENT </p><p>A SPECIAL ENVOY WITHIN 24 HOURS OF KAGAME\'S DEPARTURE. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
