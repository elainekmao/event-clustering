<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000828 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR AF/FO, AF/RA, AF/S AND AF/W </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 032/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, NI, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA TO "TARRY" BEFORE PRONOUNCING ON ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: BELLAMY/JETER EMAIL 12 March </p><p>     HARARE 657 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS.  REASON: 1.5(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  MFA PermSec says Nigeria will avoid a </p><p>rush to judgment on the Zimbabwe election.  Abuja will </p><p>consult with Pretoria and Canberra, as well as various </p><p>observer groups, before developing a position.  The GON </p><p>might even await the results of electoral challenges.  DCM </p><p>urged the GON, consonant with its leading regional role, to </p><p>stake out a position in support of democratic principles. </p><p>Nigeria\'s position would be "principled," Hart responded; </p><p>should the elections turn out to have been fundamentally </p><p>flawed, however, Nigeria would speak out, and Mugabe would </p><p>not escape criticism.  Comment at para 8 and action request </p><p>in para 9.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) President Obasanjo was out of the country in the </p><p>days before the Ambassador\'s departure for London.  FM Sule </p><p>Lamido was also unavailable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DCM 12 March engaged MFA Permanent Secretary T.D. </p><p>Hart on Zimbabwe.  The 40-minute discussion afforded an </p><p>opportunity to deploy all of ref talking points.  DCM gave </p><p>the Secretary\'s letter to Hart for onward transmission to </p><p>Lamido and provided Hart with a copy of the letter. </p><p>Earlier, PolCouns had delivered a copy of the letter to the </p><p>National Security Adviser\'s Military Assistant, LTC Idris, </p><p>to pass to the President. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Hart provided a thorough explanation of Nigeria\'s </p><p>approach to Zimbabwe, stating at several intervals that the </p><p>GON intended to "tarry" before making any pronouncement on </p><p>the election\'s legitimacy.  Abuja would "eschew any rush to </p><p>judgment."  It was necessary to hear from "our observers on </p><p>the ground" before even beginning to draw conclusions.  The </p><p>GON\'s principal source of information on Zimbabwe was CNN, </p><p>Hart noted, commenting the CNN was "an American source" and </p><p>its reporting had to be viewed in that light. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) DCM reiterated that the purpose of meeting with </p><p>Hart was to give the GON a heads-up on the direction in </p><p>which U.S. thinking was trending.  No decisions had been </p><p>taken and none would be until sufficient evidence was in </p><p>place to draw a conclusion.  Hart said that the USG had </p><p>faster access to far more information than did the GON. </p><p>President Obasanjo would consult with President Mbeki and </p><p>PM Howard and the GON would review all information coming </p><p>to its attention before drawing a conclusion about the </p><p>legitimacy of the election.  Hart thought Nigeria would </p><p>also consult with SADC.  The GON position would be built on </p><p>this base and would be consistent with Harare Principles. </p><p>Hart went on to discuss at some length the history of the </p><p>Harare Principles, recalling Abacha-era FM Tom Ikimi\'s </p><p>frequent remonstrations with Zimbabwe\'s Stan Mudenge when </p><p>Nigeria\'s status in the Commonwealth was in question:  "Tom </p><p>told him to be careful about trying to use the Harare </p><p>Principles for sanctions against one country because you </p><p>don\'t know; it might be your own [country] tomorrow." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) DCM re-emphasized the importance of Nigeria taking </p><p>a position in defense of democratic principles consistent </p><p>with its role as Africa\'s most important state.  Hart stood </p><p>firm against "acting precipitously" but averred that the </p><p>GON would not silently condone an illegitimate electoral </p><p>outcome.  Disturbingly, Hart suggested that Abuja might </p><p>await the outcome of legal challenges before taking a </p><p>stance.  However, he insisted that, if the case was clearly </p><p>made that Mugabe had stolen the election, Nigeria would say </p><p>so and deny Mugabe support.  While Hart did not say that </p><p>Nigeria would then urge Mugabe to step aside, he did offer </p><p>that President Obasanjo was increasingly frustrated with </p><p>Mugabe and his tactics and that Obasanjo had made this </p><p>point to Mugabe on at least one occasion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Hart did not think that Mugabe\'s popularity in some </p><p>Nigerian quarters would preclude a firm GON stance if the </p><p>evidence warranted it.  It was "well-known," said Hart, </p><p>that Mugabe was brutally repressive.  Many years ago, when </p><p>he was a Nigerian diplomat in Harare, Hart had seen Mugabe </p><p>dispatch troops to violently quell such minor unrest as </p><p>student strikes, with deaths a usual consequence.  Mugabe </p><p>"never brooked dissent," Hart commented, noting how </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s ruler had politically vanquished Joshua Nkomo, </p><p>the "father of the liberation struggle." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.   (C) Comment: Sufficiency of evidence is in the eye of </p><p>the beholder, and the beholder may wish to wear blinders or </p><p>rose-colored glasses.  Nigeria\'s long and strong support </p><p>for liberation in southern Africa and Obasanjo\'s personal </p><p>role in establishing that support has formed a strong bond </p><p>between Obasanjo and Mugabe and given Mugabe great stature </p><p>among the many Nigerians who resent what they perceive as </p><p>Western meddling in African affairs.  Moreover, widespread </p><p>fraud marred the 1999 election that brought Obasanjo to </p><p>power, but most observers thought the electoral malfeasance </p><p>affected Obasanjo and his opponent (Olu Falae) more or less </p><p>equally; the fraud on one side cancelled out the fraud on </p><p>the other, resulting in popular will being respected in the </p><p>overall result if not in every part of the country.  Today, </p><p>an Obasanjo whose popularity seems to diminish a bit more </p><p>with each passing day is clearly trying to preserve his </p><p>options.  His advisers, most of whom desperately want him </p><p>to remain in power (in order to retain its perquisites for </p><p>themselves), will likely discourage him from being forward- </p><p>leaning on Zimbabwe. </p><p>9.  (C) Recommendation:  We should help those in the GON </p><p>who want Nigeria to stand firmly in support of Zimbabwean </p><p>democracy.  Insufficiency of evidence is likely to be the </p><p>basis for an eventual decision either to let others take </p><p>the lead or to oppose criticizing Mugabe firmly.  We ask </p><p>that we be provided as much specific evidence of ZANU-PF/ </p><p>GOZ rigging and malfeasance as can be released to the GON. </p><p>The GON will then have a difficult time pleading ignorance </p><p>of the facts or insufficiency of evidence.  Such support by </p><p>us will encourage the GON to do what many know must be done </p><p>but find so hard to do. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
