<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002039 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH ECONOMY MARCH 28: CONTINUING PROBLEMATIC </p><p>GOT ACTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary: Markets remained quiet on March 28 am, </p><p>with T-bill yields weakening slightly to 65.7 percent.  Two </p><p>economic policy developments in the past day, however, </p><p>indicate that AK continues to take actions that won\'t improve </p><p>its credibility gap with the markets.  First, according to </p><p>press reports, AK deputies introduced a floor amendment to </p><p>the 2003 budget bill which excludes energy contracts from the </p><p>new Public Procurement Law.  Second, the Government appointed </p><p>a new state bank board, replacing experienced and respected </p><p>bankers with AK friends from the tiny and less reputable </p><p>Islamic banks.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Weaken Slightly </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) In morning trading March 28, yields on lira T-bills </p><p>rose one percentage point to 65.7 percent compounded.  The </p><p>lira was stable at TL 1,720,000.  The Istanbul Stock Exchange </p><p>100 index close down 1.3 percent.  Analysts expect markets to </p><p>remain quiet through Monday, March 31, the end of the first </p><p>quarter, when publicly traded banks will file reports and </p><p>want to limit the losses from their T-bill holdings. </p><p>Thereafter, however, markets expect T-bill yields to rise </p><p>ahead of the large April 8 T-bill auction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  T-bill trader Gumisdis of JP Morgan pointed us to </p><p>three key areas uncertainty:  "IMF Review uncertain, U.S. aid </p><p>uncertain, Northern Iraq situation uncertain.  It\'s </p><p>impossible to predict where markets will be on April 8 </p><p>without the Government providing clarity on these three </p><p>areas." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Surprise Amendment to the 2003 Budget </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) According to press reports March 28, AKP </p><p>parliamentary deputies submitted a floor amendment to the </p><p>2003 budget bill.  The budget is now slated to be voted (and </p><p>passed) on Saturday, March 29.  The amendment reportedly says </p><p>state enterprises in the energy sector are excluded from the </p><p>provisions of the Public Procurement Law which went into </p><p>effect January 1, 2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Comment:  The Public Procurement Law is a key </p><p>reform under both the IMF and EU Accession programs, and the </p><p>proposed amendment looks like bad news.  It appears to breach </p><p>a key commitment in the draft LOI, para 21:  "We will </p><p>steadfastly implement the new Public Procurement Law....If </p><p>improvements are deemed necessary, we will consult with World </p><p>Bank and IMF staff on possible amendments."  In separate </p><p>conversations March 28, Finance Ministry DDG for the Budget </p><p>Kesik and World Bank economist Arslan told us of an informal </p><p>GOT commitment to the IFIs to not change the Public </p><p>Procurement for one year, i.e., until next January.  AK </p><p>members have complained about this law, which requires open </p><p>bidding procedures and makes it more difficult to simply </p><p>award contracts to friends. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New State Bank Board - Not Confidence Enhancing </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) On March 27, the Government replaced the entire </p><p>11-person board of the two giant state banks (Ziraat and </p><p>Halk), at the state banks\' regularly scheduled annual </p><p>meeting.  Markets expected AKP-related figures to be </p><p>appointed.  However, the names appointed to run the two </p><p>largest deposit-taking banks in Turkey are raising questions. </p><p> The new Chairman of the State Bank Board, replacing the </p><p>respected Istanbul banker Safa Ocak, is Zeki Sayin - a </p><p>"right-hand man" of PM Erdogan when Erdogan served as mayor </p><p>of Istanbul. Sayin managed the Istanbul muncipality-owned </p><p>supermarket chain Belpa, and later served on the board of the </p><p>Islamic bank Family Finans.  The new GM of Ziraat Bank, Can </p><p>Caglar, was formerly GM of Family Finans and assistant GM of </p><p>Egebank (the latter went bankrupt in the year 2000 amidst </p><p>criminal embezzlement charges and some prison sentences.) </p><p>The new GM of Halk Bank  is the 35-year old Tevik Bilgin, a </p><p>sworn bank auditor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment: Islamic banks (which give depositors a </p><p>share of equity returns rather than interest) represent less </p><p>than five percent of banking assets in Turkey, and have a </p><p>reputation for poor management.   Many former Islamic bank </p><p>managers (e.g., MinFinance Unakitan and MinIndustry Coskun) </p><p>have ended up in GOT leadership positions.  Putting AKP </p><p>friends with questionable banking credentials in charge of </p><p>the two state banks at this sensitive time, however, is not </p><p>helping the pessimistic mood in the markets.  Market </p><p>expectations are that the new managers will attempt, despite </p><p>legal reforms, to revert to the old ways of using the state </p><p>banks as funnels for providing off-budget subsidies for </p><p>populist and political reasons. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
