(U) SUMMARY: CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR ANTONIO FAZIO </p><p>HAS HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT FOR FAILURE TO </p><p>REIN IN THE PUBLIC DEFICIT, WHICH HAS BALLOONED TO </p><p>NEAR E41 BILLION. THE CRITICISM, THE FIRST OPENLY SOUR </p><p>NOTE BETWEEN THE CENTRAL BANK AND THE GOVERNMENT, WAS </p><p>MADE AT THE BANK OF ITALYS ANNUAL MEETING ON MAY 31. </p><p>REACTING QUICKLY TO THE CRITICISM, FINANCE MINISTRY </p><p>TREMONTI DEFENDED THE GOVERNMENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM. </p><p>DESPITE CONCEDING THAT THE DEFICIT WAS UP AND GROWTH </p><p>STAGNATING, TREMONTI SAID THERE WOULD BE NO MID-YEAR </p><p>CORRECTIVE BUDGET. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) ON MAY 31, THE BOI GOVERNOR ANTONIO FAZIO, AT </p><p>THE PRESENTATION OF THE BANKS ANNUAL REPORT, RAISED </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE PUBLIC DEFICIT, WHICH HAS INCREASED </p><p>BY E4 BILLION OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD OF 2001. HE </p><p>ARGUED FOR A SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET PACKAGE TO BRING </p><p>PUBLIC FINANCES MORE IN LINE WITH THE STABILITY PACT </p><p>TARGETS. WARNING THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE FAILING </p><p>HEALTH OF THE PENSION SYSTEM, HE UNDERSCORED THE </p><p>URGENT NEED FOR REFORM. HE ALSO CALLED FOR </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF AN AMBITIOUS INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN, A </p><p>CORNERSTONE OF THEN-CANDIDATE SILVIO BERLUSCONIS </p><p>CAMPAIGN IDEAS TO JUMPSTART THE ECONOMY, AND THE </p><p>ACCELERATION OF PRIVATIZATION.  FAZIO URGED THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT TO MOVE FORWARD ON TAX REFORM. THE BOI </p><p>GOVERNOR WAS NOT SANGUINE ABOUT GDP GROWTH, PREDICTING </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02694  060232Z </p><p>A GROWTH RATE OF 1.5 PERCENT IN 2002.  HE DID </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GDP GROWTH COULD EXCEED 1.5 PERCENT, </p><p>IF INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING WENT UP IN THE LATTER HALF </p><p>OF THE YEAR. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) ON JUNE 3, ECONOMY MINISTER TREMONTI REITERATED THAT </p><p>THERE WOULD BE NO MID-YEAR CORRECTIVE BUDGET, AND TERSELY </p><p>ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY PASSED NEEDED </p><p>STRUCTURAL REFORMS. TREMONTI DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GROWTH </p><p>PREDICTIONS OF 2.2 PERCENT ARE OPTIMISTIC.  HE CONCEDED </p><p>THAT IN THE MOST PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO, GDP GROWTH IN 2002 </p><p>WOULD BE JUST 1.3 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) COMMENT:  THE BOI GOVERNORS WARNING FLAGS ABOUT </p><p>THE ITALIAN ECONOMY ARE ONES WE SHARE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>FAILED TO ENACT FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC REFORMS AND ITS QUICK </p><p>POLICY FIXES HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE A STRONG ECONOMIC </p><p>STIMULUS (TO BE REPORTED SEPTEL.) ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS </p><p>THE HARSHNESS OF THE GOVERNORS CRITICISM.  A YEAR AGO, </p><p>WHEN THE BERLUSCONI GOVERNMENT TOOK OFFICE, THE GOVERNOR </p><p>WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND ITS WILL TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT ITS AMBITIOUS ECONOMIC PROGRAM. FAZIOS CRITICISM </p><p>IS LEGITIMATE IN LIGHT OF ITALYS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. BUT </p><p>IT ALSO MAY BE A BIT OF POLITICAL MANEUVERING. EARLIER THIS </p><p>YEAR, MEMBERS OF THE MAJORITY COALITION PROPOSED TO </p><p>PARLIAMENT A BILL THAT WOULD TURN THE BANK OF ITALY INTO A </p><p>RESEARCH INSTITUTION AND TRANSFER ITS FUNCTIONS TO </p><p>INDEPENDENT AUTHORITIES. FAZIOS STRONG WORDS MAY BE HIS </p><p>RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>POPE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02694  060232Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02694 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
