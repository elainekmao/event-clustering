<p>S E C R E T STATE 374256 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER, LY </p><p>SUBJECT:   LIBYAN OFFICIALS INDICTED FOR BOMBING PAN 103 </p><p> </p><p>1. S - ENTIRE TEXT.  THE PAPER IS EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE </p><p>AND IS CLASSIFIED SECRET UNTIL THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 14 AT </p><p>1530 (GMT).  AFTER THAT POINT THE WHITE PAPER IS </p><p>DECLASSIFIED AND SHOULD BE SHARED WIDELY WITH HOST </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p></p><p>2.  AS DISCUSSED IN SEPTEL (MESSAGE REFERENCE NUMBER NOT </p><p>YET AVAILABLE) THE DEPARTMENT HAS PREPARED A WHITE PAPER </p><p>ENTITLED QUOTE LIBYA\'S CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM </p><p>UNQUOTE.  THE TEXT OF THAT PAPER BEGINS WITH PARAGRAPH </p><p>THREE. </p><p></p><p>3.  TITLE:  LIBYA\'S CONTINUING RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>TERRORISM </p><p></p><p>BEGIN TEXT.  INTRODUCTION </p><p></p><p>THIS WHITE PAPER IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR THE </p><p>ALLEGATIONS IN THE US AND SCOTTISH INDICTMENTS OF LIBYAN </p><p></p><p>NATIONALS FOR THE BOMBING OF PAN AM FLIGHT 103 IN </p><p>DECEMBER 1988.  TO THIS END, THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE </p><p>ATTITUDE OF THE QADHAFI GOVERNMENT TOWARD TERRORISM AND </p><p>OUTLINES LIBYAN OFFICIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERRORIST </p><p>ACTS. </p><p></p><p>BASED ON ANALYSIS OF LIBYAN BEHAVIOR OVER MANY YEARS, ON </p><p>THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATING THE BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 </p><p>SINCE 1988, AND ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE LIBYAN REGIME </p><p>AND THE RELATIONS AMONG LEADING OFFICIALS IN THAT </p><p>REGIME, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 WAS </p><p>NOT AN ABERRATION AND WAS AN ACTION AUTHORIZED BY THE </p><p>LIBYAN GOVERNMENT.  LIBYA\'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM BEGAN </p><p>IN THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THE QADHAFI REGIME.  AS EARLY AS </p><p>1972, LIBYAN LEADER MU\'AMMAR QADHAFI PUBLICLY OFFERED TO </p><p>HELP EXTREMIST MOVEMENTS -- INCLUDING THE PROVISIONAL </p><p>IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY AND THE BLACK POWER MOVEMENT IN </p><p>THE UNITED STATES -- AND TO SUPPORT ANY GROUP IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST WILLING TO ATTACK ISRAEL.  QADHAFI </p><p>DISPATCHED TERRORISTS TO ITALY IN 1973 TO SHOOT DOWN AN </p><p>ISRAELI AIRLINER, AND AT LEAST AS EARLY AS 1975 ORDERED </p><p>THE MURDER OF LIBYAN DISSIDENTS LIVING ABROAD.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>DISSIDENTS HISTORICALLY HAVE POSED LITTLE -- IF ANY -- </p><p>THREAT TO QADHAFI\'S RULE, THE LIBYAN LEADER HAS </p><p>CONCENTRATED ON ELIMINATING THEM.  ASSASSINATIONS TOOK </p><p>PLACE IN THE EARLY AND MID-1980S AND INCLUDED TWO </p><p>ATTEMPTS (ONE OF THEM SUCCESSFUL) AGAINST LIBYAN </p><p>STUDENTS IN THE U.S. </p><p></p><p>LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN AND SUPPORT OF TERRORISM EXPANDED </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE EARLY 1980S.  TRIPOLI PROVIDED PASSPORTS </p><p>TO ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION MEMBERS WHO ATTACKED THE EL AL </p><p>TICKET COUNTER AT THE VIENNA AIRPORT IN DECEMBER, 1985. </p><p>LIBYA ALSO SPONSORED THE BOMBING OF THE LA BELLE DISCO </p><p>IN BERLIN IN APRIL 1986 THAT KILLED THREE PEOPLE, </p><p>INCLUDING TWO US SERVICEMEN. </p><p></p><p>OVER THE YEARS  EVEN AS LIBYAN AGENTS AND THEIR PROXIES </p><p>PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ATTACKS, QADHAFI </p><p>REGULARLY SOUGHT TO CALM INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS THROUGH </p><p>PUBLIC DENUNCIATIONS OF TERRORISM.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1977 </p><p>QADHAFI PLOTTED TO ASSASSINATE A US AMBASSADOR, JUST </p><p>AFTER ASSURING PRESIDENT CARTER THAT HE SOUGHT GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  MOVEOVER, QADHAFI </p><p>PERIODICALLY HAS ISSUED PUBLIC DENIALS OF HIS </p><p>INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM WHILE HIS INTELLIGENCE </p><p>APPARATUS WAS PREPARING FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM.  LIBYAN </p><p>ACTION HAS NOT BEEN LIMITED TO ISRAELI AND WESTERN </p><p>TARGETS.  IN THE MID-1980\'S LIBYA BACKED PLOTS AGAINST </p><p></p><p>PRESIDENT MUBARAK OF EGYPT, FORMER PRESIDENT NIMEIRI OF </p><p>SUDAN, PRESIDENT MOBUTU OF ZAIRE\' FORMER TUNISIAN </p><p>PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA, AND FORMER PRESIDENT HABRE OF </p><p>CHAD.  IN ADDITION TO USING AND SUPPORTING TERRORISM, </p><p>QADHAFI ALSO HAS A LONG HISTORY OF TRYING TO SUBVERT </p><p>GOVERNMENTS IN AFRICA, ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>THE RECORD OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p></p><p>THE 1986 AIRSTRIKE ON LIBYA BY THE UNITED STATES, </p><p>COMBINED WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES, DID NOT END </p><p>TRIPOLI\'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM.  FOLLOWING THE AIR </p><p>ATTACK, QADHAFI BEGAN TO USE FRONT COMPANIES AND OTHER </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS TO HIDE LIBYA\'S HAND.  IN ADDITION, </p><p>QADHAFI HAS PLACED A PREMIUM ON MASKING LIBYA\'S SUPPORT </p><p>FOR TERRORISM IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID JEOPARDIZING </p><p>LIBYA\'S ECONOMIC LINKS TO HIS AFRICAN NEIGHBORS AND </p><p>MAJOR EUROPEAN TRADING PARTNERS. </p><p></p><p>THE LIBYANS SPONSORED A SERIES OF ANTI-US OPERATIONS </p><p>IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE US AIRSTRIKES IN APRIL, 1986. </p><p>TRIPOLI WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHOOTING OF A US EMBASSY </p><p>COMMUNICATOR IN SUDAN ON 15 APRIL 1986 AND FOR THE </p><p>SHOOTING OF ANOTHER EMBASSY COMMUNICATOR IN SANAA, NORTH </p><p>YEMEN, ON 25 APRIL 1986.  IN ADDITION, TWO LIBYANS WERE </p><p>APPREHENDED ON 18 APRIL 1986 AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO ATTACK </p><p>THE US OFFICERS CLUB IN ANKARA WITH GRENADES OBTAINED </p><p>FROM THE LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S BUREAU THERE.  THE LIBYANS </p><p>CONFESSED THAT THEY WERE ORDERED TO CAUSE THE MAXIMUM </p><p>NUMBER OF CASUALITIES, PARTICULARLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN. </p><p></p><p>WE BELIEVE THAT LIBYA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF PAN AM FLIGHT 103 OVER LOCKERBIE. </p><p>SCOTLAND, ON 21 DECEMBER 1988, AND THAT SENIOR </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN PREVIOUS TERRORIST </p><p>ATTACKS AROUND THE WORLD ORCHESTRATED THE OPERATION. </p><p>FORENSIC EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE BOMB\'S TIMER WAS </p><p>UNIQUE TO LIBYAN INVENTORIES, AND AN OFFICIAL OF THE </p><p>LIBYAN NATIONAL CARRIER, LIBYAN ARAB AIRLINES, USED HIS </p><p>CREDENTIALS TO CIRCUMVENT SECURITY PROCEDURES IN MALTA </p><p>TO ASSIST IN THE OPERATION. </p><p></p><p>OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, LIBYA HAS PROVIDED </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS, ENABLING THEM TO </p><p>LAUNCH ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL AND WESTERN TARGETS: </p><p></p><p>-- IN MAY 1990, PALESTINE LIBERATION FRONT MEMBERS </p><p>ATTEMPTED A SEABORNE RAID ON ISRAEL; THE OPERATION </p><p>FAILED, AND FOUR TERRORISTS WERE KILLED AND 12 </p><p>CAPTURED.  LIBYA PROVIDED THE GROUP WITH TRAINING, </p><p>SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT, WEAPONRY, AND THE MOTHERSHIP </p><p>USED IN THE OPERATION. </p><p></p><p>-IN JULY 1988, ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION (ANO) OPERATIVES </p><p>ATTACKED THE GREEK CRUISE SHIP THE CITY OF POROS, </p><p>KILLING NINE AND WOUNDING OVER 100 PEOPLE.  LIBYA </p><p>PROVIDED THE WEAPONS USED IN THIS OPERATION. </p><p></p><p>LIBYA HAS REGARDED AFRICA AS AN ATTRACTIVE ENVIRONMENT </p><p>FOR ITS OPERATIONS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL </p><p>ATTACKS THERE: </p><p></p><p>--ON 30 OCTOBER 1991, A FRENCH JUDGE ISSUED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANTS, CHARGING FOUR LIBYAN </p><p>OFFICIALS WITH INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOMBING OF UTA FLIGHT </p><p>772 IN SEPTEMBER 1989. </p><p></p><p>--IN MARCH 1990, LIBYAN DIPLOMATS WERE EXPELLED FROM </p><p>ETHIOPIA AFTER A BOMB EXPLODED IN THE HILTON HOTEL IN </p><p>ADDIS ABABA, IN AN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO KILL THE ISRAELI </p><p>AMBASSADOR WHO WAS STAYING THERE. </p><p></p><p>--IN FEBRUARY 1988, TWO KNOWN LIBYAN TERRORISTS WERE </p><p>ARRESTED IN DAKAR, SENEGAL, IN POSSESSION OF EXPLOSIVES </p><p>AND WEAPONS. </p><p></p><p>--IN OCTOBER 1987, A BOMB EXPLODED IN THE OFFICE OF </p><p>WORLD VISION, A PRIVATE RELIEF ORGANIZATION OPERATING IN </p><p>MOUDOU, CHAD.  LIBYAN DIPLOMATS BASED IN COTONOU, BENIN, </p><p>ASSISTED THE TERRORISTS WHO CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK. </p><p></p><p>--IN MARCH 1987, A BOMB EXPLODED AT THE CAFE </p><p>"L\'HISTORIL" IN DJIBOUTI, KILLING 11 AND WOUNDING 50. </p><p>THE LIBYANS ORDERED A PALESTINIAN GROUP, THE POPULAR </p><p>STRUGGLE FRONT, TO CONDUCT THE ATTACK OR RISK LOSING </p><p>TRIPOLI\'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT. </p><p></p><p>THE LIBYANS HAVE SUPPORTED TERRORIST GROUPS IN EUROPE, </p><p>PARTICULARLY THE PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY </p><p>(PIRA), WHICH COLONEL QADHAFI HAS CALLED A "POPULAR" </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT.  THROUGHOUT THE MID-1980S </p><p>LIBYA PROVIDED THE GROUP WITH ARMS.  LIBYA\'S HAND WAS </p><p>OPENLY REVEALED IN OCTOBER 1987, WHEN FRENCH AUTHORITIES </p><p>INTERCEPTED A FREIGHTER, THE EKSUND, OFF THE COAST OF </p><p>FRANCE AND SEIZED 150 TONS OF WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES </p><p>DESTINED FOR THE PIRA.  LIBYA HAS ALSO PROVIDED </p><p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE PIRA. </p><p></p><p>SINCE APRIL 1986, LIBYAN ASSASSINS HAVE MURDERED THREE </p><p>ANTI-QADHAFI LIBYAN DISSIDENTS RESIDING IN GREECE, </p><p>ITALY, AND FRANCE.  TRIPOLI HAS CONTINUED TO TARGET </p><p>OTHER EXILES DEEMED "OPPONENTS" OF THE LIBYAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>CURRENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p></p><p>DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, </p><p>LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM TODAY REMAINS </p><p>EXTENSIVE.  TRIPOLI IS ONE OF THE LARGEST FINANCIERS OF </p><p>TERRORISTS WORLDWIDE, AND IT CONTINUES TO PERMIT </p><p>TERRORIST GROUPS TO OPERATE AT CAMPS THROUGHOUT LIBYA. </p><p></p><p>IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE LIBYANS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A </p><p>WIDE RANGE OF TERRORIST GROUPS: </p><p></p><p>--THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION (ANO) -- WHICH HAS </p><p>CONDUCTED OVER 100 TERRORIST ATTACKS RESULTING IN THE </p><p>DEATHS OF MORE THAN 280 PEOPLE AND THE WOUNDING OF OVER </p><p>650 SINCE ITS FOUNDING -- CONTINUES TO RECEIVE </p><p>SIGNIFICANT LIBYAN SUPPORT.  THE GROUP IS HEADQUARTERED </p><p>IN TRIPOLI, AND LIBYA PROVIDES THE ANO WITH MAJOR </p><p>TRAINING FACILITIES AND SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. </p><p></p><p>--QADHAFI PROVIDED WELL OVER 1 MILLION DOLLARS TO AHMED </p><p>JABRIL\'S POPULAR FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF </p><p>PALESTINE-GENERAL COMMAND IN 1990.  THE GROUP WAS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMBINGS OF TWO US MILITARY TRAINS </p><p>IN GERMANY IN 1987 AND 1988. </p><p></p><p>--ELEMENTS OF THE PALESTINE LIBERATION FRONT (PLF) </p><p>REMAIN BASED IN LIBYA AND RECEIVE FINANCIAL AND LOGISTIC </p><p>SUPPORT FROM THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT.  THE GROUP HAS A </p><p>LONG HISTORY OF TERRORIST ATTACKS, INCLUDING THE </p><p>HIJACKING OF THE CRUISE SHIP ACHILLE LAURO IN OCTOBER </p><p>1985, WHICH RESULTED IN THE MURDER OF A WHEELCHAIR-BOUND </p><p>AMERICAN TOURIST ON BOARD, AND THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED </p><p>ATTACK ON A TEL AVIV BEACH. </p><p></p><p>--LIBYA ALSO FUNDS SA\'IQA AND ELEMENTS OF THE PALESTINE </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD. </p><p></p><p>LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR NON-PALESTINIAN GROUPS HAS BECOME </p><p>INCREASINGLY SELECTIVE.  THE MAIN CRITERION APPEARS TO </p><p>BE THE DEGREE TO WHICH A GROUP DEMONSTRATES A CAPABILITY </p><p>AND WILLINGNESS TO ATTACK LIBYA\'S ENEMIES WORLDWIDE, </p><p>INCLUDING US AND OTHER WESTERN TARGETS. </p><p></p><p>IN EUROPE, LIBYA MAINTAINS TIES TO THE PROVISIONAL IRISH </p><p>REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) DESPITE QADHAFI\'S CLAIM EARLIER </p><p>THIS YEAR TO HAVE ENDED SUPPORT FOR THE GROUP.  THE </p><p>LIBYANS HAVE CONTACT WITH THE KURDISH SEPARATIST GROUP, </p><p>THE PKK, WHICH HAS CONDUCTED NUMEROUS TERRORIST ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST TURKISH TARGETS. </p><p></p><p>A PRINCIPAL RECIPIENT OF LIBYAN FINANCING IN ASIA IS THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE PHILIPPINES (CPP) AND ITS </p><p>MILITARY WING, THE NEW PEOPLE\'S ARMY (NPA)  WHICH HAS </p><p>KILLED 10 AMERICANS SINCE 1987.  THE LIBYANS HAVE </p><p>PROVIDED AT LEAST 7 MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CPP/NPA SINCE </p><p>1987. </p><p></p><p>IN LATIN AMERICA, THE LIBYANS CONTINUE TO SEARCH OUT </p><p>GROUPS WILLING TO KILL AMERICANS.  FOR EXAMPLE, LAST </p><p>YEAR TRIPOLI PAID THE HAITIAN LIBERATION ORGANIZATION </p><p>OVER 20,000 DOLLARS TO CARRY OUT AN ATTACK AGAINST THE </p><p>US EMBASSY IN PORT-AU-PRINCE; THE GROUP, HOWEVER FAILED </p><p>TO ACCOMPLISH ITS MISSION.  LIBYA HAS UNSUCCESSFULLY </p><p>TRIED TO RECRUIT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION </p><p>FRONT IN EL SALVADOR TO CONDUCT ANTI-WESTERN ATTACKS IN </p><p>RETURN FOR MONEY. </p><p></p><p>THE LIBYANS ALSO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH OTHER TERRORIST </p><p>GROUPS IN THE REGION, INCLUDING THE COSTA RICAN JUAN </p><p>SANTA MARIA PATRIOTIC ORGANIZATION, TUPAC AMARU </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN PERU, AND THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ </p><p>PATRIOTIC FRONT IN CHILE. </p><p></p><p>THE ANTI-IMPERIALISM CENTER (AIC) -- ALSO KNOWN AS </p><p>MATHABA -- IS USED BY THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT </p><p>TERRORIST NETWORKS AND THUS PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN </p><p>QADHAFI\'S TERRORISM STRATEGY.  ESTABLISHED IN 1982 TO </p><p>SUPPORT "LIBERATION AND REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS," THE AIC </p><p>HAS SPONSORED A NUMBER OF STRIDENTLY ANTI-WESTERN </p><p>CONFERENCES IN TRIPOLI.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE AIC\'S </p><p>MISSION IS TO IDENTIFY AND RECRUIT REVOLUTIONARIES FOR </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL AND MILITARY TRAINING IN LIBYA.  DURING </p><p>THEIR TRAINING AT AIC CAMPS, INDIVIDUALS ARE SELECTED </p><p>FOR ADVANCED TRAINING, INCLUDING WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES, </p><p>AND INDOCTRINATION. </p><p></p><p>THE AIC IS HEADED BY MUSA KUSA, A QADHAFI CONFIDANT WHO </p><p>IS ALSO LIBYA\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER.  WITH </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES IN MANY LIBYAN EMBASSIES WORLDWIDE, THE </p><p>AIC RUNS ITS OWN INDEPENDENT CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS AND </p><p>DISBURSES PAYMENTS TO TERRORIST, INSURGENT, AND </p><p>SUBVERSIVE GROUPS. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>TRAINING </p><p>-------- </p><p></p><p>COLONEL QADHAFI CONTINUES TO TRAIN MIDDLE EASTERN, </p><p>AFRICAN, ASIAN, AND LATIN AMERICAN TERRORIST AND </p><p>DISSIDENT ORGANIZATIONS AT CAMPS IN LIBYA, INCLUDING </p><p>TRIPOLI.  THE LARGEST TRAINING CAMPS INCLUDE: </p><p></p><p>--AL QALAH.  ABOUT 100 KILOMETERS SOUTHWEST OF TRIPOLI, </p><p>IT IS THE PRINCIPAL ANO FACILITY IN LIBYA.  OVER THE </p><p>PAST YEAR THE ANO HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE SIZE OF </p><p>THE CAMP. </p><p></p><p>--SEVEN APRIL TRAINING CAMP.  LOCATED ABOUT NINE </p><p>KILOMETERS FROM TRIPOLI  THE FACILITY PROVIDES TRAINING </p><p>IN TERRORISM AND SUBVERSION TO AFRICANS AND LATIN </p><p>AMERICANS, AS WELL AS TO LIBYAN MILITARY PERSONNEL. </p><p></p><p>--SIDI BILAL PORT FACILITY.  TERRORISTS WHO CARRIED OUT </p><p>THE MAY 1990 SEABORNE ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL WERE TRAINED </p><p>HERE. </p><p></p><p>-BIN GHASHIR.  JUST SOUTH OF TRIPOLI, IT HAS BEEN USED </p><p>TO TRAIN DISSIDENTS FROM AFRICA, ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA </p><p>IN TERRORIST/GUERRILLA TACTICS. </p><p></p><p>--RAS AL HILAL.  PALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE </p><p>TRAINED AT THIS FACILITY. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>OUTLOOK FOR INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p></p><p>TERRORISM IS AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT OF LIBYAN FOREIGN </p><p>POLICY.  LIBYA WILL USE TERRORISM TO FURTHER ITS AGENDA, </p><p>PARTICULARLY WHEN COLONEL QADHAFI BELIEVES HE CAN </p><p>PLAUSIBLY DENY INVOLVEMENT.  QADHAFI\'S USE AND SUPPORT </p><p>OF TERRORISM AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POLICY BELIE EFFORTS TO </p><p>PERSUADE THE WORLD THAT HE DOES NOT SPONSOR TERRORIST </p><p>ACTS.  LIBYAN OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF </p><p>TERRORISM REMAIN IN SENIOR GOVERNMENT POSITIONS.  LAST </p><p>YEAR QADHAFI APPOINTED IBRAHIM BISHARI, THE HEAD OF THE </p><p>LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND A KEY PLAYER IN LIBYAN </p><p>TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE 1980S. AS LIBYA\'S FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>THE CASE OF UTA 772 </p><p>------------------- </p><p></p><p>ON 30 OCTOBER 1991, A FRENCH MAGISTRATE ISSUED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST FOUR LIBYAN </p><p>OFFICIALS FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE BOMBING OF UTA FLIGHT </p><p>772 IN SEPTEMBER 1989.  THE FLIGHT, WHICH WAS BOUND FROM </p><p>BRAZZAVILLE, CONGO TO PARIS VIA NDJAMENA, CHAD EXPLODED </p><p>OVER THE DESERT IN SOUTHEASTERN NIGER, KILLING ALL 171 </p><p>PASSENGERS AND CREW MEMBERS.  SEVEN AMERICANS, INCLUDING </p><p>THE WIFE OF THE US AMBASSADOR TO CHAD, WERE AMONG THE </p><p>PASSENGERS.  IN ADDITION TO THE WARRANTS AGAINST </p><p>ABADALLAH SANUSSI (A RELATIVE OF QADHAFI AND </p><p>SECOND-IN-COMMAND OF LIBYA\'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICES), </p><p>NAYLI IBRAHIM (ONE OF SANUSSI\'S SUBORDINATES), ABD </p><p>AL-AZRAGH, AND ABBAS MUSBAH (A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE </p><p>LIBYAN SERVICES IN BRAZZAVILLE), THE JUDGE ISSUED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LOOKOUT NOTICES AGAINST MUSA KUSA (HEAD OF </p><p>THE AIC AND DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER) AND ABD AL-SALAM </p><p>ZADMA.  ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES, AL-AZRAGH, FIRST </p><p>SECRETARY AT THE LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S BUREAU IN BRAZZAVILLE, </p><p>CONGO, RECRUITED THREE CONGOLESE TO PLANT A SUITCASE </p><p>BOMB ON THE FLIGHT AND PROVIDED THEM WITH THE DEVICE. </p><p>TWO OF THE THREE ARE NOW IN JAIL, ONE IN THE CONGO AND </p><p>ONE IN ZAIRE. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>THE LIBYAN USE OF TERRORIST FRONTS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p></p><p>BECAUSE OF PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF THE ROLE OF LIBYAN </p><p>PEOPLE\'S BUREAUS (LPBS) IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN </p><p>THE EARLY 1980S, LIBYA HAS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS </p><p>SHIFTED SOME OF ITS TERRORIST SUPPORT OPERATIONS TO </p><p>OTHER INSTITUTIONS.  THESE INSTITUTIONS INCLUDE THE </p><p>ISLAMIC CALL SOCIETY, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS AND </p><p>FRIENDSHIP SOCIETIES, AND LIBYAN FRONT COMPANIES.  BY </p><p>USING MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS, LIBYA IS ABLE TO CONTINUE </p><p>ITS ACTIVITIES EVEN IF ONE GROUP IS EXPOSED. </p><p></p><p>FRONT COMPANIES PROVIDE LIBYAN OPERATIVES WITH COVER AND </p><p>DECEPTION CAPABILITIES.  SOME OF THESE COMPANIES </p><p>PROBABLY WERE ESTABLISHED AS LEGITIMATE CORPORATIONS, </p><p>BUT THEY HAVE BEEN BLACKMAILED INTO COOPERATING WITH THE </p><p>LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  THE FRONT COMPANIES </p><p>TYPICALLY ESTABLISH A PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL NATIONALS </p><p>TO ENHANCE THEIR COVER.  THE COMPANIES\' PARTNERS RARELY </p><p>KNOW THAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE </p><p>OFFICERS OR LIBYAN BUSINESSMEN TAKING ORDERS FROM THE </p><p>LIBYAN GOVERNMENT. </p><p></p><p>LIBYAN FRONT COMPANIES KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY OR </p><p>INDIRECTLY INVOLVED IN TERRORIST OPERATIONS OVER THE </p><p>PAST DECADE INCLUDE EXO-COMMERCE AND SARRA OR SARRAH. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER THE GUISE OF A "LEGITIMATE" BUSINESS, </p><p>THE BENIN-BASED SARRAH COMPANY INFILTRATED ARMS AND </p><p>EXPLOSIVES INTO NEIGHBORING AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR </p><p></p><p>TERRORIST ACTS IN THE LATE 1980S.  ANOTHER FRONT </p><p>COMPANY, THE GREEK-BASED GERMA SHIPPING AND STEVEDORING </p><p>COMPANY, OWNED THE TINY STAR, THE MOTHERSHIP USED IN THE </p><p>30 MAY 1990 PLF ATTACK ON ISRAEL, LAUNCHED FROM A LIBYAN </p><p>PORT. </p><p> </p><p>IN ADDITION, OTHER BUSINESSES ARE SURROGATES OF THE </p><p>LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.  NEUTRON INTERNATIONAL IS </p><p>RUN BY MUSBAH WARFALLI, AN ARCHITECT OF LIBYAN ATTACKS </p><p>AGAINST LIBYAN DISSIDENTS IN THE EARLY 1980S.  THE </p><p>LIBYAN ARAB FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANY, OR LAFICO, IS </p><p>WHOLLY OWNED BY THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT AND IS SOMETIMES </p><p>USED BY THE LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE FOR COVER </p><p>PURPOSES.  THE GENERAL ARAB AFRICAN COMPANY IS A MAJOR </p><p>TRADING COMPANY SERVING AS A FRONT FOR LIBYAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE THROUGHOUT SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. </p><p></p><p>EVEN LIBYAN BUSINESSMEN NOT READILY IDENTIFIED WITH THE </p><p>LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE OR A FRONT COMPANY HAVE BEEN </p><p>USED IN OPERATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN JANUARY 1991, THE </p><p>CHADIAN GOVERNMENT ARRESTED TWO LIBYAN AGENTS POSING AS </p><p>BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE APPARENTLY ATTEMPTING TO SMUGGLE </p><p>EXPLOSIVES INTO NDJAMENA.  WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE </p><p>THAT MANY OTHER LIBYAN BUSINESSMEN AND BUSINESSES </p><p>WORLDWIDE ARE LINKED TO THE LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. </p><p></p><p>LIBYAN ARAB AIRLINES (LAA) IS THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED </p><p>NATIONAL FLAG CARRIER, PROVIDING SCHEDULED PASSENGER AND </p><p>CARGO SERVICE TO EUROPE, AFRICA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST. </p><p>ALTHOUGH IT CONDUCTS LEGITIMATE ACTIVITIES, LAA HAS BEEN </p><p>USED TO TRANSPORT ARMS, EXPLOSIVES, AND TERRORISTS. </p><p>AMONG THE LIBYANS IMPLICATED IN SUPPLYING ARMS TO THE </p><p>PIRA FROM 1985 TO 1987 WAS AN LAA EMPLOYEE.  AN LAA </p><p>FLIGHT WAS USED IN THE AUGUST 1986 ESCAPE OF SIX </p><p>TERRORISTS BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 3 AUGUST </p><p>ATTACK ON THE BRITISH BASE AT AKROTIRI, CYPRUS.  THE SIX </p><p>WERE DISGUISED AS AIRLINE CREW MEMBERS, AND THE CAPTAIN </p><p>MADE FALSE STATEMENTS TO AIRPORT AUTHORITIES ABOUT THE </p><p>CREW\'S SIZE TO DISGUISE THEIR PRESENCE.  THE AIRLINE </p><p>REMAINS WELL POSITIONED TO ASSIST IN AN ATTACK, </p><p>PARTICULARLY SINCE AT LEAST 30 PERCENT OF LAA EMPLOYEES </p><p>POSTED ABROAD ARE LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS. </p><p></p><p>THE ISLAMIC CALL SOCIETY (ICS), CREATED BY THE LIBYANS </p><p>TO PROPAGATE ISLAM, IS USED FOR LEGITIMATE RELIGIOUS </p><p>PURPOSES, BUT QADHAFI ALSO EXPLOITS THE ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>PHILANTHROPIC REPUTATION TO ADVANCE HIS TERRORIST </p><p>AGENDA.  THE ICS OFFICE IN CURACAO ASSISTED SEPARATISTS </p><p>WHO BOMBED A GOVERNMENT OFFICE IN CAYENNE, FRENCH </p><p></p><p>GUYANA, IN JANUARY, 1987.  FOR MUCH OF THE 1980S TRIPOLI </p><p>USED ITS CALL SOCIETY OFFICE IN CONTONOU, BENIN, TO </p><p>RECRUIT AND FUND TERRORISTS IN THE REGION. </p><p></p><p>THE LIBYANS ALSO USE TRAVEL AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD TO </p><p>FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF LOCAL TERRORISTS TO LIBYA FOR </p><p>ADVANCED TRAINING.  THE AGENCY NORMALLY BOOKS </p><p>DISSIDENTS/TERRORISTS FOR TRAVEL THROUGH THIRD COUNTRIES </p><p>SO THEIR ULTIMATE DESTINATION -- LIBYAN TERRORIST </p><p>TRAINING CAMPS -- GOES UNDETECTED. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>COMPARING QADHAFI\'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON TERRORISM WITH </p><p>THE FACTS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p></p><p>THE FICTION:  LIBYA DENOUNCES THE PROVISIONAL IRISH </p><p>REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) BOMBING IN ENNISKILLEN, NORTHERN </p><p>IRELAND, IN WHICH 11 DIED AND 65 WERE INJURED.  JANA 10 </p><p>NOVEMBER 1987. </p><p></p><p>THE FACT:  FRENCH AUTHORITIES INTERCEPTED A SHIP </p><p>CARRYING 150 TONS OF ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES PROVIDED BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA AND DESTINED FOR PIRA IN IRELAND, 31 </p><p>OCTOBER 1987.  FOUR EARLIER SHIPMENTS SUCCESSFULLY </p><p>ARRIVED AT THEIR DESTINATION. </p><p></p><p>THE FICTION:  "THE GREAT JAMAHIRIYAH DOES NOT PRACTICE </p><p>TERRORISM, NOR DOES IT SUPPORT IT."  COLONEL QADHAFI, 11 </p><p>FEBRUARY 1988. </p><p></p><p>THE FACT:  PAN AM 103 EXPLODED OVER SCOTLAND  KILLING </p><p>259 PERSONS ON BOARD, AND 11 CITIZENS OF LOCKERBIE ON </p><p>THE GROUND.

VIRTUALLY ALL TERRORIST </p><p>OPERATIVES WHO ARE TRAINED IN LIBYA RECEIVE, AT A </p><p>MINIMUM, TRAVEL MONEY AND A SMALL STIPEND FOR </p><p>PERSONAL EXPENSES. </p><p></p><p>--  LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S BUREAUS AND THE ANTI-IMPERIALISM </p><p>CENTERS ARE USED TO TRANSFER FUNDS TO TERRORISTS. </p><p></p><p>--  RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUPS OFTEN RECEIVE LIBYAN </p><p>FUNDING THROUGH BANK ACCOUNTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST. </p><p></p><p>--  ON RARE OCCASIONS THE LIBYANS HAVE USED COURIERS TO </p><p>DELIVER MONEY TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS;  THE </p><p>TRANSFER USUALLY OCCURS IN A THIRD COUNTRY. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>LIBYAN TRAINING CAMPS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p></p><p>LIBYA HAS TRAINED PALESTINIAN AND OTHER TERRORISTS IN </p><p>COUNTRY SINCE THE EARLY 1970S.  IN ADDITION TO THE </p><p>PRINCIPAL FACILITIES IN AND AROUND TRIPOLI, OVER THE </p><p>PAST TWO DECADES THE LIBYANS HAVE OPERATED SMALLER </p><p>TRAINING CAMPS DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THEIR COUNTRY.  ON </p><p>SOME OCCASIONS, TERRORISTS ARE TRAINED AT LIBYAN </p><p>MILITARY BASES.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1988 MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUP, THE POPULAR STRUGGLE FRONT, </p><p>TRAINED AT AN AIR FORCE BASE IN THE AOUZOU REGION. </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE PFLP-GC ALSO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE TRAINED IN </p><p>LIBYAN MILITARY CAMPS. </p><p></p><p>NON-PALESTINIAN GROUPS THAT HAVE RECEIVED TRAINING IN </p><p>LIBYA IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDE THE ECUADORIAN ALFARO </p><p>VIVE, CARAJO ORGANIZATION, COLOMBIA\'S M-19  THE HAITIAN </p><p>LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, THE CHILEAN MANUEL RODRIGUEZ </p><p>PATRIOTIC FRONT, THE ARMENIAN SECRET ARMY FOR THE </p><p>LIBERATION OF ARMENIA, AND THE JAPANESE RED ARMY. </p><p></p><p>TRAINEES FROM ASIA, LATIN AMERICA, AND AFRICA OFTEN GO </p><p>TO LIBYA LEGALLY, USUALLY PRETENDING TO BE STUDENTS. </p><p>SOMETIMES, THIRD WORLD NATIONALS TRAVEL TO LIBYA FOR </p><p>WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE LEGITIMATE SCHOOLING, SUCH AS </p><p>TECHNICAL OR RELIGIOUS TRAINING.  WHEN THEY ARRIVE, </p><p>HOWEVER, THEY FIND THEMSELVES MET AT THE AIRPORT BY </p><p>SOLDIERS, PLACED ON A TRUCK, AND TRANSPORTED TO A </p><p>TERRORIST/DISSIDENT TRAINING CAMP.  THOSE STUDENTS </p><p>HOSTILE TO LIBYAN OVERTURES ARE SUMMARILY DEPORTED AND </p><p>BRANDED AS UNWORTHY STUDENTS. </p><p></p><p>EXTREMISTS TRAVEL TO LIBYA USING OTHER METHODS AS WELL. </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, RADICALS FROM MAURITIUS TRAVELED TO TRIPOLI </p><p>IN 1987 OSTENSIBLY TO ATTEND A YOUTH CONFERENCE. </p><p>INSTEAD, THEY WENT TO A TERRORIST TRAINING CAMP. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>QADHAFI AND KIDNAPPING </p><p>----------------------- </p><p></p><p>THE HOLLOWNESS OF QADHAFI\'S RHETORIC IS BEST ILLUSTRATED </p><p>BY LIBYA\'S LONGSTANDING INVOLVEMENT IN KIDNAPPING, </p><p>DESPITE HIS REGULAR DENUNCIATIONS OF SUCH ACTS.  IN 1978 </p><p>LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS KIDNAPPED IMAM MUSA SADR, </p><p>THE SPIRITUAL LEADER OF THE LEBANESE SHIA COMMUNITY, </p><p>JUST AFTER HE ARRIVED IN TRIPOLI.

THE HOSTAGES--BELGIAN AND FRENCH </p><p>NATIONALS--WERE RELEASED IN STAGES, WITH THE LAST </p><p>DETAINEES FREED JANUARY 1991.  THE YACHT WAS SEIZED BY </p><p>ANO ELEMENTS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE LIBYAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, AND SOME OF THE HOSTAGES WERE EVEN </p><p>HELD ON LIBYAN SOIL.
