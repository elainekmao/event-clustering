<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008859 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH HEAD  SCARF DEBATE: "THE TURBAN IS A MORAL </p><p>ISSUE" </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter. </p><p>Reason:  1.5(b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: As Turkey watchers speculate about </p><p>newly-elected Justice and Development (AK) Party leader Recep </p><p>Tayyip Erdogan\'s political priorities, university professor </p><p>Huseyn Bagci, an academic advisor to Erdogan, shared his </p><p>views on a variety of issues.  Bagci affirmed "The turban </p><p>(head scarf) is a moral issue.  It will be dealt with at the </p><p>right time."  Bagci\'s views more nearly parallel those of the </p><p>average Turk, rather than those of other academics and </p><p>writers and reflect what we have heard from within AK </p><p>regarding the timing of its agenda.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) As part of a round of post-election discussions with </p><p>Turkish academics, Poloff called on Middle East Technical </p><p>University international relations professor Dr. Huseyn Bagci </p><p>December 3.  Bagci, who earned his Ph.D. from Bonn University </p><p>in 1988 when he was 29 years old, specializes in </p><p>Turkish-European, particularly French and German, relations </p><p>and often provides international political commentary for </p><p>Turkish print and electronic media.  Very much the senior </p><p>academic running a graduate-level seminar, Bagci shared his </p><p>views on a variety of contemporary issues with Poloff: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- on Afghanistan:  "Turkey has a cultural and historical </p><p>obligation to take care of the people of Afghanistan." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- on imperialism:  "France, Britain and Germany were great </p><p>imperial powers.  Britain\'s imperialism has left us with four </p><p>major problems today:  Ireland, Kashmir, Turkey and Greece, </p><p>and Israel and Palestine." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- on Iraq:  "No Turkish sultan would have stopped at the </p><p>borders of Kuwait (as the U.S. did during the Gulf War).  He </p><p>would have gone directly to Baghdad and gotten Saddam. </p><p>Turkish history is filled with pashas (generals) such as </p><p>Mehmet Ali, who ignored commands from sultans.  The U.S. is a </p><p>second-tier imperialist for not having gone after Saddam." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- on Turkey\'s elections;  In contrast to other academics </p><p>Poloff has canvassed, asked whether he falls into the </p><p>category that thinks Erdogan (AK Party) was elected because </p><p>Turkish voters really like his program or the group that </p><p>thinks Erdogan won because large numbers stayed away from the </p><p>polls, Bagci responded easily, "the former group."  He </p><p>considers Erdogan a charismatic leader whose visits with </p><p>European leaders resulted in his passing his first test with </p><p>flying colors.  Again in contrast to other academics, Bagci\'s </p><p>opinions about Turkish politics and the elections more nearly </p><p>parallel those held by the average Turk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- on whether he is a friend of Erdogan\'s:  Bagci responded </p><p>no, but asserted that he is a "close advisor."  Erdogan knows </p><p>him and follows his advice, he averred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- and most important, the turban (Islamist head scarf): </p><p>Bagci replied that it is a "moral issue.  The question is </p><p>when is it appropriate to defend a moral issue?"  Answering </p><p>his own question, Bagci stated, "It will happen when the time </p><p>is right, just as the fruit of a tree should not be picked </p><p>before it is fully ripe."  Bagci is the first academic Poloff </p><p>has talked to who acknowledges the moral aspect to the turban </p><p>issue and who believes it will be dealt with once other </p><p>important issues, such as the economy and admission to the </p><p>European Union are resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Comment:  Academics and columnists have speculated </p><p>about the implications, symbolism and appropriateness of </p><p>turban-wearing wives and staffers of senior officials, such </p><p>as Prime Minister Abdullah Gul.  While Bagci is the only </p><p>academic we know who has described the turban as a "moral </p><p>issue," his observations are important because they openly </p><p>affirm what the average Turk is saying, which is very </p><p>different from what has been offered so far by other </p><p>academics and intellectuals.  His observations on the timing </p><p>of AK Party\'s moves to overcome the ban on wearing of head </p><p>scarves tracks with what we hear from AK Party headquarters. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
