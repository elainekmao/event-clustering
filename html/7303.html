<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 000626 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, IO/SHA, WHA/CCA, DRL/MLA </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  04-10-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, CE, CU, UNCHR-1 </p><p>SUBJECT:  Ambassador presses Foreign Minister to support </p><p>UNCHR resolution re Cuba </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) State 91613; (B) State 91349 (All Notal) </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Ambassador Wills spoke to Sri Lankan Foreign </p><p>Minister Tyronne Fernando this morning (April 10) and </p><p>urged the GSL to support the resolution re Cuba now </p><p>before the UNCHR.  Fernando remarked that Sri Lanka had </p><p>traditionally abstained on the Cuba vote.  The </p><p>Ambassador reviewed Ref A talking points, underscoring </p><p>that the Castro regime\'s latest activities were </p><p>especially egregious and that Sri Lanka, as a new member </p><p>of the UNCHR, could play a key role on this vital human </p><p>rights matter.  Fernando replied that he would consider </p><p>the issue with his advisers in the next day and then get </p><p>back in touch with us. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) COMMENT:  Our guess is that it will be very </p><p>tough to move the GSL from an abstention to a "yes" </p><p>vote.  The Sri Lankan MFA is full of NAM-type thinking, </p><p>which gets in the way of sound policy judgments.  That </p><p>said, the current government has taken a somewhat better </p><p>tack re international organization matters, so it is </p><p>very much worth a try.  In addition to the meeting with </p><p>Ambassador Subasinghe, we suggest that Department raise </p><p>this matter with Minister Milinda Moragoda, who will be </p><p>in Washington for the April 14 seminar on Sri Lanka. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
