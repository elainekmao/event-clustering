<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 003715 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 12/13/11 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ECON, PHUM, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  AGOA DECISION CONVEYED TO GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 211333 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF MATT HARRINGTON. </p><p>REASONS:  1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF DELIVERED REFTEL TALKING </p><p>POINTS ON DECEMBER 13 TO MINISTRY OF FINANCE PERMANENT </p><p>SECRETARY NICHOLAS NCUBE.  POLCHIEF REPORTED THAT ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR AGOA BENEFITS IN 2002, DESCRIBED THE </p><p>REASONS ELABORATED IN REFTEL, AND LEFT NCUBE WITH A NON- </p><p>PAPER.  HE STRESSED THAT THIS WAS NOT A PERMANENT DECISION. </p><p>WE CONDUCT AN ELIGIBILITY REVIEW ANNUALLY, AND SIGNIFICANT </p><p>PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING USG CONCERNS WOULD STRENGTHEN </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S CHANCES FOR ELIGIBILITY IN 2003. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) THE DECISION WAS NOT A SURPRISE TO NCUBE.  WHILE HE </p><p>WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A DIFFERENT OUTCOME, HE DESCRIBED THE </p><p>USG DETERMINATION AS "STRAIGHTFORWARD, BASED PRIMARILY ON </p><p>GOOD GOVERNANCE CONCERNS."  HE LAMENTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAS BEEN IN ELECTION MODE FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS, BEGINNING </p><p>WITH THE FAILED CAMPAIGN FOR A NEW CONSTITUTION IN 1999. </p><p>DURING THAT PERIOD, ALL GOZ POLICIES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED </p><p>WITH THE NEED TO WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN MIND.  HE </p><p>AND FINANCE MINISTER MAKONI HAVE BEEN RESTRICTED PRIMARILY </p><p>TO DAMAGE CONTROL -- HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AT SOME OF THE </p><p>PROPOSALS THAT HAVE LANDED ON HIS DESK -- BUT HE HOPED </p><p>THAT, ONCE THE ELECTION IS OVER, HE AND HIS BOSS CAN BEGIN </p><p>TO NURSE ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMY BACK TO HEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: LIKE HIS BOSS, SIMBA MAKONI, NCUBE IS A </p><p>FRANK INTERLOCUTOR WHO IS USUALLY HONEST ABOUT HIS </p><p>UNHAPPINESS OVER THE NATIONAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HERE. </p><p>IN THIS MEETING, HE WAS MOST FRUSTRATED THAT ZANU-PF\'S </p><p>DETERMINATION TO WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAS </p><p>PREVENTED HIS MINISTRY FROM ADDRESSING THIS COUNTRY\'S </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  03715  131614Z </p><p>SERIOUS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, AND HE WAS RESIGNED TO THE FACT </p><p>THAT THIS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE UNTIL THE ELECTION. </p><p>WE HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE AGOA DECISION, FOLLOWING SO </p><p>CLOSELY ON THE HEELS OF ZDERA\'S PASSAGE, WILL LEAD THE GOZ </p><p>TO MOVE US UP A NOTCH OR TWO ON THE ENEMIES LIST AND TO </p><p>SUBJECT US TO FURTHER ROASTING FROM THE GOVERNMENT- </p><p>CONTROLLED PRESS -- LED BY INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN </p><p>MOYO. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
