<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L COLOMBO 001121 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>OFFICIAL INFORMAL </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS </p><p> </p><p>E.O.  12958:  DECL: 06-26-13 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, CE, MV </p><p>SUBJECT:  OFFICIAL INFORMAL NUMBER 96  (06-26-03) </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Donald A. Camp, Charge d\'Affaires, </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>CONTENTS:  MALDIVES\' GRADUATION FROM LDC STATUS </p><p>-          DRAFT PROPOSAL TO TIGERS WITHIN TWO WEEKS </p><p>-          PRESIDENT KUMARATUNGA IN THE PRESS </p><p>-          REQUEST RE FMF REAPPORTIONMENT </p><p>-          MFA UPSET RE CLOSING OF LOCAL IRAQI MISSION </p><p> </p><p>MALDIVES\' GRADUATION FROM LDC STATUS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>1.  (U) Today we received an advance copy of a </p><p>letter(faxed to desk) from Fathulla Jameel, Minister of </p><p>Foreign Affairs, to Secretary Powell, seeking US support </p><p>for the deferment of the Maldives\' graduation from LDC </p><p>status at the July ECOSOC meeting.  Previously, we </p><p>supported the Maldives maintaining LDC status, and it </p><p>required considerable coordination in WDC.  Please raise </p><p>this issue with the relevant offices (EB, IO) and some </p><p>potential supporters (S.Donnelly and AmbDes.Lunsted) to </p><p>begin formulating the US position.  This is a key issue </p><p>for the Maldives, a firm friend that asks little of the </p><p>US.  Charge\' Camp hopes to visit July 13 and this will </p><p>surely be a prime topic on their agenda.  (ECON) </p><p> </p><p>DRAFT PROPOSAL TO TIGERS WITHIN TWO WEEKS </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (C) News reports are giving wide play to a comment by </p><p>key government advisor G.L. Peiris during his June 26 </p><p>weekly press briefing re a draft proposal for an interim </p><p>administration.  Peiris is reported to have said that the </p><p>GSL would be submitting to the Tigers a draft interim </p><p>administration proposal for the north and east within two </p><p>weeks.  These comments are not unexpected, just the </p><p>latest in ongoing attempts by the GSL to woo the Tigers </p><p>into resuming talks.  Further, during Charge\'s June 26 </p><p>meeting with Ports Minister and leader of the Sri Lanka </p><p>Muslim Congress, Rauf Hakeem, we learned that Hakeem </p><p>expected to be briefed by Peiris that evening on the </p><p>GSL\'s draft proposal.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT KUMARATUNGA IN THE PRESS </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>3. (C) There was ample press speculation here June 26 </p><p>that President Kumaratunga might be plotting a takeover </p><p>of the Defense and Interior Ministries.  During a follow </p><p>up call with her spokesman, he assured us that Her </p><p>Excellency has no plans to annex those two key </p><p>ministries.  He added that the president remains </p><p>concerned over the status of military readiness and the </p><p>state of law and order in the island.  This lack of </p><p>takeover intent on the part of the president was seconded </p><p>today when the Opposition Leader Mahinda Rajapakse met </p><p>with Charge today (June 26).  Rajapakse confirmed that </p><p>fellow politicians in the president\'s party were making </p><p>noise re this issue, but that the president did not </p><p>intend to make any ministerial move without public </p><p>support.  It is noteworthy, however, that Kumaratunga </p><p>waited until the PM was out of the country to have her </p><p>spokesman hold a press conference.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>REQUEST RE FMF REAPPORTIONMENT </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>4.  (C) Ref Colombo 1063 re $5 million USD of Foreign </p><p>Military Funding allocated to India, Post wishes to </p><p>reiterate its interest in seeing if this could be </p><p>reallocated to Sri Lanka, if spurned by GOI.  Could you </p><p>please provide us with some kind of update re this issue? </p><p>Thanks.  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>MFA UPSET RE CLOSING OF LOCAL IRAQI MISSION </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>5.  (C) Foreign Secretary Nihal Rodrigo called the Charge </p><p>today (June 26) to express his concern over the planned </p><p>closing of the Iraqi mission in town, per the decision of </p><p>the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad.  His </p><p>concern stemmed from the trade relationship -- export of </p><p>significant quantities of Sri Lankan tea -- between the </p><p>two countries.  While Rodrigo is going to send a formal </p><p>note, could Washington provide us with some insight re </p><p>the rationale for closing the Iraqi mission here (and in </p><p>some 30 other countries) to pass on to him?  (POL) </p><p> </p><p>CAMP </p><p></p></div>
