MPP UMBRELLA THEME;  THE PROGRAM SUPPORTED MPP OBJECTIVE </p><p>ON "DEMOCRACY AND FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION." </p><p> </p><p>6.  RESULTS AND IMPACT:  DESPITE BEING QUITE INTENSIVE, MS. </p><p>ABDUL HAQ AND MS. AL HADIDI FOUND THE TOUR EXCELLENT AND </p><p>VERY USEFUL AS IT PROVIDED THEM WITH WORTHWHILE INSIGHT ON </p><p>U.S. ECONOMIC POLICY AND ECONOMIC/BUSINESS REPORTING. BOTH </p><p>REPORTERS WERE VERY PLEASED WITH ALL THE MEETINGS SCHEDULED </p><p>IN THEIR TOUR. THEY APPRECIATED THE GOOD EFFORTS EXERTED IN </p><p>SETTING UP MEETINGS, HOPING THAT FUTURE PARTICIPANTS WILL </p><p>HAVE MORE TIME BETWEEN EACH MEETING OR EVENT TO ORGANIZE </p><p>THEIR THOUGHTS AND TO REFLECT ON THE OUTCOME.

ABDUL HAQ AND MS. AL HADIDI WOULD HAVE LIKED TO MEET </p><p>WITH U.S. GROUPS AND FIGURES THAT OPPOSE U.S. POLICY IN THE </p><p>MIDDLE EAST TO GET THE FULL PICTURE ON HOW PEOPLE VIEW THIS </p><p>MATTER. THEY ALSO QUESTIONED THE SELECTION OF SEVERAL OF THE </p><p>PARTICIPANTS, NOTING THAT TWO OF THEM WERE NOT ECONOMIC AND </p><p>BUSINESS REPORTERS, AND DID NOT APPEAR TO RELATE TO THE </p><p>CONTENTS OF THE TOUR. </p><p> </p><p>BOTH REPORTERS WERE NOT TOO HAPPY BY WHAT THEY VIEWED AS </p><p>STRICT SECURITY MEASURES, PARTICULARLY THE PHYSICAL </p><p>INSPECTIONS THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH AT U.S. AIRPORTS. </p><p>HOWEVER, THEY WERE WELL AWARE THAT THOSE MEASURES ARE VERY </p><p>IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF CITIZENS AND </p><p>VISITORS ALIKE. </p><p> </p><p>MEDIA COVERAGE:  DURING THE TOUR, MS. ABDUL HAQ FILED FIVE </p><p>STORIES IN ARABIC, ALL OF WHICH WERE PUBLISHED IN AL-ARAB AL- </p><p>YAWM.  MS. AL HADIDI FILED SIX STORIES IN ARABIC.
