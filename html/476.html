ZIMBABWE\'S RESPONSE TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>6.  DURING AND AFTER THE CONFLICT IN THE GULF, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE PROVIDED ARMED SECURITY PERSONNEL </p><p>TO PROTECT MANY EMBASSIES, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN </p><p>MISSION.  TWO IRAQIS SUSPECTED OF PLOTTING A TERRORIST </p><p>ACT AGAINST THE AMERICAN EMBASSY WERE DEPORTED BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN JANUARY. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ONLY ONE TERRORIST INCIDENT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE IN 1991.  A SMALL BOMB EXPLODED INSIDE THE </p><p>HARARE SHERATON HOTEL ON JULY 20, CAUSING EXTENSIVE </p><p>DAMAGE TO THE HOTEL\'S FIRST THREE FLOORS, WHICH HOUSE </p><p>RESTAURANTS, CONFERENCE ROOMS, AND SHOPS.  THREE PEOPLE </p><p>WERE INJURED, TREATED AT LOCAL HOSPITALS, AND RELEASED. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE SUSPECTS THAT SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>ELEMENTS OR MIDDLE EASTERN GOVERNMENT AGENTS CARRIED OUT </p><p>THE BOMBING.  THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SUSPECTS THAT </p><p>THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT WAS INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  TWO LIBYANS WERE DEPORTED FROM ZIMBABWE IN 1991. </p><p>ACCORDING TO AN ARTICLE IN THE NOVEMBER 3 EDITION OF THE </p><p>HARARE SUNDAY TIMES, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE DEPORTED </p><p>THE TWO LIBYANS IN AUGUST 1991 FOR "SECURITY REASONS." </p><p>THE MEN--ABDUSSALIM ELGMATT, AN EDITORIAL COORDINATOR OF </p><p>THE WORLD MATHABA MAGAZINE, AND ALI KHALEF, A </p><p>CLERK--WERE DEPORTED ON AUGUST 22.  ELGMATT HAD PLANNED </p><p>TO CONDUCT INTERVIEWS WITH AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE, </p><p>INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUGABE, AND LEADERS OF SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICAN LIBERATION MOVEMENTS.  THE ZIMBABWEAN EMBASSY IN </p><p>TRIPOLI ISSUED THE TWO MEN VISAS.  IN JUNE 1989, THE </p><p>THEN LIBYAN AMBASSADOR, MOHAMMED ISAMADAH, WAS ALSO </p><p>EXPELLED FOR SECURITY REASONS. </p><p> </p><p>E. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1991 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>9.  ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO CROSS BORDER ATTACKS IN 1991, </p><p>FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THE MOZAMBICAN NATIONAL RESISTANCE </p><p>(MNR OR RENAMO) HAS OPERATED ACROSS THE </p><p>MOZAMBIQUE-ZIMBABWE BORDER, COMMITTING ATROCITIES ON </p><p>BOTH SIDES.  THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE RESPONDED BY </p><p>DEPLOYING TROOPS ALONG THE EASTERN BORDER AND INTO PARTS </p><p>OF MOZAMBIQUE TO COMBAT THE BANDITS.  IN SEPTEMBER 1991, </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND USAID AGREED TO JOINTLY </p><p>PROGRAM UP TO US$500,000 TO CONSTRUCT RECEPTION CENTERS </p><p>FOR REFUGEES FLEEING THE CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>F. ZIMBABWEAN SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>10.  ZIMBABWE DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE PLO IS ACCORDED FULL DIPLOMATIC STATUS WITH </p><p>AN ACCREDITED AMBASSADOR WHO IS THE DEAN OF THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS.  THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES THE </p><p>SO-CALLED STATE OF PALESTINE. </p><p> </p><p>G. PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>11.  ALTHOUGH ZIMBABWE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH CUBA, </p><p>IRAN, NORTH KOREA, AND THE PLO, IT HAS NOT MADE ANY </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING </p><p>COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>12.  THE GULF WAR HAS LED THE GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE ITS </p><p>ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM AND TERRORIST-SUPPORTING </p><p>STATES OVER THE PAST YEAR.  RELATIONS WITH IRAQ, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, HAVE COOLED, AS HAVE RELATIONS WITH CUBA AND </p><p>LIBYA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SNIDER </p><p></p></div>
