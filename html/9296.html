<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001206 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: APGA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OJUKWU MEETS </p><p>AMBASSADOR </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5 (B & D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY: Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, APGA\'s </p><p>Presidential candidate in the recent elections and </p><p>leader of Biafra\'s failed secession in the sixties, </p><p>met Ambassador Jeter at his residence on June 25 to </p><p>discuss the Nigeria\'s elections, his observations on </p><p>Obasanjo, and the way forward for Nigeria.    End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, APGA\'s 2003 Presidential </p><p>candidate and leader of the East\'s (Biafra) failed </p><p>secession in the sixties, requested a meeting with </p><p>Ambassador to discuss current issues in Nigeria. </p><p>Ojukwu commented that rigging had been expected but </p><p>that what the governing PDP and Obasanjo did went </p><p>beyond the pale of even Nigeria\'s permissible limits, </p><p>forcing the opposition to contest the results. </p><p>"Obasanjo is the incumbent and if he had rigged 10 </p><p>percent, no one would have complained.  Even if he </p><p>only took 25 percent, we could have accepted it, </p><p>Ojukwu claimed.  However, Obasanjo "provoked" us and </p><p>"rode roughshod" over the process to gain his re- </p><p>election, Ojukwu declared.  "I hold the President </p><p>personally responsible for the failure of the </p><p>elections," Ojukwu stated.  Ojukwu said that he had </p><p>told Obasanjo that he was his friend but, nonetheless, </p><p>had to take responsibility.  When Ambassador Jeter </p><p>asked how Obasanjo responded, Ojukwu said simply, "he </p><p>did not." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Ambassador Jeter asked Ojukwu if he would </p><p>pursue his case to the Supreme Court and commented </p><p>that the quality of the electoral tribunals should not </p><p>be pre-judged before the tribunals had actually </p><p>finished their hearings.  Ojukwu confirmed that he was </p><p>committed to following the legal process to its </p><p>conclusion, saying that it was the opposition\'s "only </p><p>alternative."  The Ambassador pointed to the </p><p>computerized voters list and the guidelines for </p><p>registering parties as positive outcomes from the 2003 </p><p>elections, adding, moreover, that there had been no </p><p>suggestion of military intervention.  Ojukwu responded </p><p>that talk of military intervention was present, and, </p><p>indeed, increasing due to Obasanjo\'s hubris. </p><p>(Comment.  We have no indication that this is true; in </p><p>fact, Obasanjo has pretty much neutralized a </p><p>politicized military.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>ON OBASANJO </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Ojukwu commented on conversations held with </p><p>the President since the elections.  Ojukwu </p><p>characterized Obasanjo as someone who feels he has </p><p>"conquered" the country.  Obasanjo pointed out that no </p><p>leader in Nigeria\'s history had his level of control </p><p>over the Middle Belt, the East, the Southwest and the </p><p>National Assembly at the same time.  Ojukwu says that </p><p>he warned Obasanjo that this is not good politics and </p><p>that Obasanjo\'s political barometer was off kilter. </p><p>Ojukwu told Obasanjo that the Middle Belt is in arms, </p><p>the East is in arms and, worse, the North is in arms. </p><p>Ojukwu warned the President that he was making the </p><p>same mistake that Gideon Orka made in 1990.  (NOTE: </p><p>The 1990 "Orka Coup" was unsuccessful.  If it ever had </p><p>a chance for success, Orka\'s coup became doomed when </p><p>he announced his intent to excise the northern states </p><p>from Nigeria, prompting a backlash from other officers </p><p>dedicated to keeping Nigeria together.  END NOTE.) </p><p>Ojukwu recounted Obasanjo responding that "if they </p><p>(the North) try anything, I will deal with them." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The Ambassador asked if Obasanjo had made </p><p>efforts to balance representation in the government, </p><p>pointing out that Obasanjo\'s Ministerial appointments </p><p>come from every part of the country.  Ojukwu responded </p><p>that any balance in appointments was superficial.  He </p><p>said that a "bigger Yoruba presence, an angry North </p><p>and an East cut out of the system" does not constitute </p><p>balance.  Commenting that Obasanjo is viewed as a </p><p>"Yoruba President," Ojukwu said that the main problem </p><p>is that he "draws lines without regard for the </p><p>people."  Ojukwu dismissed the Igbo appointees to the </p><p>new Cabinet as politicians "unacceptable to the East." </p><p>"I object to the feeling of conquest," Ojukwu </p><p>complained.  He said that Nigeria needed </p><p>"accommodating politics" instead of confrontation, and </p><p>that Obasanjo\'s pursuit of a Yoruba agenda was </p><p>detrimental.  Ojukwu commented that "public posturing </p><p>does not solve problems" and stated that "we (Igbos) </p><p>have always complained about being ruled by the North, </p><p>but now we know it was infinitely better than </p><p>Obasanjo." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Ambassador Jeter asked if Ojukwu did not </p><p>believe that the President would work harder this time </p><p>to make the 2007 elections better in order to ensure </p><p>his legacy.  Ojukwu agreed that Obasanjo wanted a </p><p>legacy but questioned whether Obasanjo\'s legacy was to </p><p>seek immortality. </p><p>------------------ </p><p>ON THE WAY FORWARD </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Ojukwu identified Nigeria\'s three major </p><p>problems: 1) a crippled economy, 2) increased </p><p>corruption, and 3) an extremely agitated North.  He </p><p>commented that he worries when the North is upset </p><p>because "they follow no middle ground;" for them it is </p><p>either acquiescence or an all-out fight.  The </p><p>Federation is faulty, Ojukwu claimed and stressed that </p><p>Nigerians should not be over-emphasizing the divisions </p><p>that already exist, as Ojukwu believed Obasanjo is </p><p>doing.  He said that Shari\'a and Islamic </p><p>"fundamentalism" are on the rise because of the other </p><p>things going wrong.  Instead of ignoring the problems, </p><p>Ojukwu suggested that Nigerians should discuss </p><p>specific limits and include them in the Constitution. </p><p>"Instead, we don\'t talk about the problems, especially </p><p>those related to Nigeria\'s unity," he averred. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Ojukwu said that three weeks ago he advised </p><p>Obasanjo to tell Nigerians that the Presidency was </p><p>aware of the problems with the elections and assure </p><p>the public of the Government\'s support for democracy. </p><p>He proposed that Obasanjo call publicly for a National </p><p>Conference and make sure that no one tampers with its </p><p>decisions.  He said Obasanjo should also clean up the </p><p>problems with INEC.  Ojuwku said that the President\'s </p><p>first step should be to "sack the entire Commission" </p><p>and institute policies to improve the independence of </p><p>elections in Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) As the meeting drew to a close, Ambassador </p><p>reminded Ojukwu that a cardinal principle of U.S. </p><p>policy on Nigeria was to maintain the country\'s </p><p>territorial integrity.  That policy had not changed, </p><p>and we would oppose efforts, from any quarter, that </p><p>sought to fragment the country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Despite Ojukwu\'s claim of friendship with </p><p>Obasanjo, there is a history of enmity between them. </p><p>Ojukwu threw Nigeria into a costly, tragic civil war </p><p>that claimed at least a million lives and ended when </p><p>Biafra surrendered to the GON\'s commanding general, </p><p>Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  Obasanjo considers himself Nigeria\'s </p><p>foremost nationalist while he sees Ojukwu as Nigeria\'s </p><p>worst secessionist.  If Ojukwu has somehow managed to </p><p>like Obasanjo, we doubt if that feeling is </p><p>reciprocated.  Moreover, it is true that secessionist </p><p>embers die hard and still burn in Ojukwu\'s chest. </p><p>Nevertheless, his influence and popularity among the </p><p>Igbo are unassailable.  For many, he symbolizes the </p><p>Igbo\'s unrequited aspirations for national leadership </p><p>in Nigeria or in a republic they can call their own. </p><p>Because of his special status, he helped attract </p><p>significant support to APGA in the April elections. </p><p>But for vote manipulation in the five Southeastern </p><p>states, APGA probably might have won numerous National </p><p>Assembly seats and 1 to 3 gubernatorial races (Enugu, </p><p>Anambra and Imo). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  The election also gave Ojukwu a new lease on </p><p>political life that he is exploiting with flare.  He </p><p>has now added the sobriquet of "wronged Presidential </p><p>candidate" to his litany of perceived injustices by </p><p>the GON.  Pointing to the legitimate flaws in the </p><p>election in the Southeast, Ojukwu is attempting to </p><p>stoke Igbo sentiment by publicly claiming Obasanjo\'s </p><p>election is illegitimate.  He and other Igbo leaders </p><p>are also contemplating establishing a shadow </p><p>government, a move that will worsen his relations with </p><p>Abuja and likely alienate other parts of the country. </p><p>13.  (C) Many of Ojukwu\'s moves and utterances are </p><p>bombastic.  Yet much of it reflects genuine </p><p>frustration among the Igbo that the election results </p><p>were excessively tampered.  Because the electoral </p><p>tribunals will overturn very few, if any, of the </p><p>Southeast races and because Obasanjo has dismissed the </p><p>idea of reaching a "political solution" with Igbo </p><p>moderates to allow APGA to reclaim some seats, many </p><p>Igbo politicians who otherwise would have kept their </p><p>distance have rallied around Ojukwu.  Now the question </p><p>is will Ojukwu fizzle out in time or will he continue </p><p>to agitate.  While widespread violence and unrest is </p><p>unlikely from this quarter, continued Ojukwu posturing </p><p>could keep political tension in the Southeast high. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
