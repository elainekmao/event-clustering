(C) ICTY ZAGREB RESREP THOMAS OSORIO TOLD US MAY 5 THAT </p><p>THE GOC HAS IMPROVED COOPERATION IN THE MONTH FOLLOWING THE </p><p>VISIT OF OTP CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE TO ZAGREB.  THE GOC </p><p>LARGELY HAS FULFILLED OUTSTANDING DOCUMENT REQUESTS AND </p><p>APPEARED SOMEWHAT MORE PROACTIVE IN THE GOTOVINA CASE -- IT </p><p>IS SET TO ISSUE A REWARD FOR HIS ARREST ON MAY 10.  THE IVICA </p><p>RAJIC TRANSFER TO ICTY CUSTODY APPEARED TO BE MOVING AHEAD AS </p><p>WELL AS THE GOC INVESTIGATION AGAINST THOSE THAT SHELTERED </p><p>AND SUPPORTED HIM AND OTHER CROATIAN PIFWCS.  THE ONLY BLACK </p><p>CLOUD FOR OSORIO WAS DEL PONTE\'S POOR HANDLING OF A ZAGREB </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS REQUEST FOR AN "ICTY ISSUES CHECKLIST." </p><p>DESPITE OSORIO\'S WARNINGS, DEL PONTE CIRCULATED A </p><p>POORLY-CRAFTED DOCUMENT THAT -- IF LEAKED -- COULD CLOUD </p><p>GOC-ICTY RELATIONS.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>IMPROVED COOPERATION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) ON MAY 5, ICTY ZAGREB RESREP THOMAS OSORIO TOLD US </p><p>THAT THE GOC -- FOR NOW -- HAS BEEN LIVING UP TO THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01037  01 OF 02  091539Z </p><p>COMMITMENTS PM RACAN MADE WHEN OTP CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE </p><p>VISITED ZAGREB A MONTH EARLIER (REF B): </p><p> </p><p>-- THE OTP RECEIVED THE BULK OF THE RAW CENSUS DATA IT </p><p>REQUESTED.  WHILE SOME DATA ARE MISSING, OSORIO -- AT THIS </p><p>POINT -- CONSIDERS THIS TO BE A TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT ON THE </p><p>PART OF THE GOC CENSUS BUREAU AND NOT A GOC ATTEMPT TO </p><p>OBFUSCATE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE OTP IS WORKING WITH STATE PROSECUTOR BAJIC TO DEVELOP </p><p>THE EXACT LANGUAGE THAT HE WOULD USE TO OBTAIN CROATIAN COURT </p><p>PERMISSION TO ACCESS PRIVREDNA BANKA RECORDS RELATED TO GOC </p><p>FINANCING OF THE WAR IN BOSNIA. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE OTP RECEIVED OVER 1100 PAGES OF PERSONAL DOCUMENTS OF </p><p>THE FORMER GOC MINISTER OF DEFENSE GOJKO SUSAK, A KEY OTP </p><p>DOCUMENT REQUEST.  OTP INVESTIGATORS ARE CLOSELY ANALYZING </p><p>THE FILES, WHICH COULD HAVE BEARING ON A WIDE RANGE OF ICTY </p><p>CASES, INCLUDING THE BLASKIC APPEAL. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE OTP ALSO WAS GIVEN ACCESS TO THE MILITARY ARCHIVES OF </p><p>THE SEVEN CROATIAN ARMY BRIGADES THAT OPERATED IN BOSNIA FROM </p><p>1992 TO 1994. </p><p> </p><p>GOTOVINA </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) OSORIO SAID THAT, IN EARLY MAY, THE HEAD OF THE GOC </p><p>OFFICE FOR COOPERATION WITH ICTY REASSURED HIM THAT THE GOC </p><p>DECISION TO ISSUE A REWARD FOR ICTY FUGITIVE ANTE GOTOVINA </p><p>WAS IRONCLAD.  IN A MEETING WITH US ON MAY 8, DIRECTOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01037  01 OF 02  091539Z </p><p>GENERAL OF POLICE RANKO OSTOJIC CONFIRMED THAT THE GOC WOULD </p><p>ISSUE THE GOTOVINA REWARD ON MAY 10 IN THE AMOUNT OF 350,000 </p><p>KUNA (USD 55,000).  THAT AMOUNT, SAID OSTOJIC, IS AT LEAST </p><p>SEVEN TIMES HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER REWARD ISSUED IN CROATIAN </p><p>HISTORY.  OSTOJIC ALSO TOLD US THAT POLICE IN THE ZADAR AREA </p><p>-- CENTRAL DALMATIA -- HAVE BEEN GIVEN SPECIFIC ORDERS TO </p><p>TAIL AND SURVEIL GOTOVINA FAMILY MEMBERS AND KNOWN </p><p>SYMPATHIZERS. </p><p> </p><p>IVICA RAJIC </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ON APRIL 30, THE ZAGREB COUNTY COURT RULED THAT THE </p><p>ICTY HAS JURISDICTION OVER IVICA RAJIC AND APPROVED HIS </p><p>TRANSFER TO THE HAGUE.  RAJIC\'S LAWYERS APPEALED THE DECISION </p><p>TO THE CROATIAN SUPREME COURT, BUT LEGAL EXPERTS TOLD US THE </p><p>APPEAL HAS NO CHANCE OF PROSPERING.  RAJIC SHOULD BE IN ICTY </p><p>CUSTODY NO LATER THAN THE END OF MAY. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) OSORIO TOLD US THAT DEL PONTE, DURING HER MEETING WITH </p><p>PM RACAN, MADE IT CLEAR THAT SHE WANTS ALL INFORMATION THAT </p><p>THE GOC DEVELOPS ON HOW RAJIC LIVED FREELY (UNDER ALIAS) IN </p><p>CROATIA FOR SEVEN YEARS AFTER HIS OTP INDICTMENT.  RACAN </p><p>REPORTEDLY PROMISED HER THAT A "FULL REPORT WOULD BE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4223 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  01037  02 OF 02  091539Z </p><p>ACTION SWCI-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AF-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EAP-00   EUR-00   FBIE-00 </p><p>      VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   DHS-00   CAEX-00  PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SSO-00 </p><p>      SS-00    TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00 </p><p>      DRL-01   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /005W </p><p>                  ------------------62A3DF  091540Z /38 </p><p>P 091526Z MAY 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0156 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE PRIORITY </p><p>DEPT OF JUSTICE WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USNATO PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USOSCE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 001037 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR S/WCI, EUR/SCE, INL/AAE, AND EUR/ACE </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE/WHEATON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KAWC, KJUS, PREL, UNSC, ICTY, HR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  01037  02 OF 02  091539Z </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTY/CROATIA: IMPROVING GOC COOPERATION, RAJIC </p><p>CASE MOVING AHEAD </p><p> </p><p>FORTHCOMING." </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) OSTOJIC AND BAJIC TOLD US THAT THE GOC STILL IS </p><p>PIECING TOGETHER THE COMPLEX NETWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE </p><p>FORMER HDZ GOVERNMENT THAT PROTECTED IVICA RAJIC AND OTHER </p><p>ICTY PIFWCS.  THEY PLAN TO INDICT ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN THE </p><p>ILLEGAL "OPERATION HAAG," CODE NAME FOR PROGRAM THAT </p><p>SHELTERED PIFWCS AND RAN INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS AGAINST </p><p>ICTY, SFOR, AND OTHERS (REF A). </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) OSTOJIC TOLD US THAT THE EFFORT TO PROTECT RAJIC WAS </p><p>MASTERFUL:  WHEN HIS SPECIAL POLICE UNIT BEGAN ITS </p><p>INVESTIGATION IN MID-2002, THERE WAS NO RECORD IN THE GOC TO </p><p>INDICATE THAT AN IVICA RAJIC OFFICIALLY EVER EXISTED IN </p><p>CROATIA.  CRITICALLY, ALL COPIES OF RAJIC\'S FINGERPRINT FILES </p><p>HAD BEEN DESTROYED.  OSTOJIC SAID THAT THE POLICE WERE ABLE </p><p>TO GET A COPY OF RAJIC\'S FINGERPRINTS FROM BIH GOVERNMENT </p><p>AUTHORITIES WITHOUT TIPPING THEIR HAND TO THE ONGOING </p><p>INVESTIGATION.  WITHOUT THOSE PRINTS, THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE </p><p>BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY CONCLUSIVELY THE PIFWC, WHO, WHEN </p><p>ARRESTED, WAS LIVING IN A SUBURB OF SPLIT UNDER THE NAME OF </p><p>JAKOV KOVAC. </p><p> </p><p>CDP "NON PAPER:" GOOD IDEA, POOR EXECUTION </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) OSORIO SAID THAT DEL PONTE\'S POOR HANDLING OF A </p><p>REQUEST FROM THE ZAGREB DIPLOMATIC CORPS FOR A "COOPERATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01037  02 OF 02  091539Z </p><p>CHECK LIST" MARRED WHAT OTHERWISE HAS BEEN A GOOD MONTH FOR </p><p>GOC-ICTY COOPERATION.  (DURING HER VISIT TO ZAGREB, IC REPS </p><p>REQUESTED THAT THE OTP GENERATE AN "ISSUES CHECK LIST" THAT </p><p>THEY COULD USE WHEN ENGAGING THE GOC ON COOPERATION WITH ICTY </p><p>(REF B)).  ON APRIL 24 OSORIO GAVE US AN ADVANCE COPY OF AN </p><p>OTP "NON-PAPER," SAYING THAT THIS WAS WHAT DEL PONTE PROPOSED </p><p>DISTRIBUTING TO THE IC (DOCUMENT POUCHED TO S/WCI AND </p><p>EUR/SCE). </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) WE TOLD OSORIO THAT WHILE THE IDEA OF A BASIC </p><p>CHECKLIST HAD MERIT, THE OTP "NON-PAPER" WAS FAR TOO LONG, </p><p>DENSE AND "PREACHY."  WE SUGGESTED TO OSORIO THAT THE OTP\'S </p><p>SUBMISSION SHOULD BE SHORTER AND STRICTLY FACTUAL, OUTLINING </p><p>AREAS OF NON-COOPERATION AND WHAT THE GOC MUST DO TO MEET OTP </p><p>REQUESTS. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) OSORIO SAID HE SHARED OUR VIEW (AS DID THE LOCAL OSCE </p><p>MISSION, WHICH ALSO WAS GIVEN AN ADVANCE COPY OF THE </p><p>"NON-PAPER"), AND HELD OFF ON DELIVERING THE DOCUMENT TO THE </p><p>LOCAL EU TROIKA, DESPITE EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS FROM DEL </p><p>PONTE.  HE TOLD US THAT ON APRIL 29 HE CALLED DEL PONTE TO </p><p>EXPRESS HIS RESERVATIONS.  HE SAID THAT SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT </p><p>THE DOCUMENT WAS FLAWED, BUT ORDERED HIM TO GIVE IT TO THE </p><p>ZAGREB EU TROIKA AND THE U.S. EMBASSY ANYWAY; SHE PERSONALLY </p><p>HAD GIVEN THE DOCUMENT TO SOLANA, PATTEN AND PRODI THE </p><p>PREVIOUS DAY DURING A VISIT TO BRUSSELS.  SHE TOLD OSORIO </p><p>"WE\'LL GET IT RIGHT NEXT TIME."  OSORIO SAID THAT HE WAS </p><p>CONVINCED THAT THE GOC WOULD GET ITS HANDS ON THE DOCUMENT, </p><p>WHICH IT WOULD LEAK TO THE PRESS -- AT A TIME OF ITS CHOOSING </p><p>-- TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE OTP IS NOT SINCERE IN ITS EFFORTS </p><p>TO BUILD A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01037  02 OF 02  091539Z </p><p>MOON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
