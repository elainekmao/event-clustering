<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 001315 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, PINR, NP, Political Parties, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Bomb Explodes at PM\'s Party Headquarters </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) Kathmandu 1309, B) Kathmandu 1198 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) A bomb exploded July 5 at the newly-opened </p><p>Kathmandu office of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba\'s </p><p>faction of the Nepali Congress Party (NCP) around 10:45 </p><p>a.m. local time.  Police sources confirmed ten people </p><p>injured and hospitalized.  One remains in critical </p><p>condition.  Security forces immediately cordoned off the </p><p>area, a business district in southeastern Kathmandu. </p><p>Police suspect that the explosion, in a ground-floor </p><p>reception area, was caused by a timed device.  So far no </p><p>one has claimed responsibility and no arrests have been </p><p>made. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Minister for Physical Planning and Works </p><p>Chiranjibi Wagle--the second-ranking figure in Nepal\'s </p><p>government--reportedly was in the building when the blast </p><p>went off but escaped injury.  Prime Minister Deuba was not </p><p>present.  Reached by telephone after the incident, the PM </p><p>told Ambassador that any help the USG could offer in </p><p>carrying out the investigation of the blast would be </p><p>welcome.  [Note:  For two months previous to the July 5 </p><p>bombing, Kathmandu had seen only one act of political </p><p>violence, the June 17 attempted firebombing of the home of </p><p>a high-ranking army officer (Ref B).  End Note.] </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Comment:  Although no party has yet claimed </p><p>responsibility for the attack, it likely was the work of </p><p>Maoist insurgents rather than Deuba\'s political rivals. </p><p>So far the two NCP factions look content to litigate their </p><p>differences.  Embassy is alert to the possibility that </p><p>this bombing could signal the resumption of Maoist attacks </p><p>in the capital, but likely was designed to underline </p><p>Maoist opposition to promised national parliamentary </p><p>elections.  Nepali Maoist leader Pachandra recently issued </p><p>a broadside threatening to prevent the election (Ref A). </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
