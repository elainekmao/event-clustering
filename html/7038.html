<p>UNCLAS COLOMBO 000561 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR D, A/S ROCCA, USAID/AA/ANE WENDY CHAMBERLIN AND IRAQ </p><p>TASK FORCE </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAID, ECON, EAGR, IZ, CE, UN, External Relations, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01: SRI LANKA PROPOSES TO SELL THE U.S. TEA FOR </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AID TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request, please see para. 8. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The government of Sri Lanka (GSL) has proposed </p><p>selling the USG about USD 2 million in tea to include in US </p><p>humanitarian aid to the people of Iraq.  Minister of </p><p>Plantation Industries Lakshman Kiriella made the pitch to </p><p>the Ambassador on April 2, outlining GSL\'s rationale for the </p><p>proposal.  Sri Lanka, he said, has traditionally supplied </p><p>tea to Iraq, most recently under the UN\'s Oil for Food </p><p>program.  When conflict broke out two weeks ago, Sri Lankan </p><p>tea sales to Iraq halted, with a devastating effect on the </p><p>local tea industry - particularly on the "low-grown" teas </p><p>traditionally sold to Iraq.  Large quantities of "low-grown" </p><p>went unsold at the March 25 tea auction, prompting the GSL </p><p>make this request.  Kiriella made the pitch for the U.S. to </p><p>make this USD 2 million purchase at the next scheduled tea </p><p>auction on April 8. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Kiriella emphasized that "low-grown" tea is </p><p>typically farmed by small landholders (about 260,000 people </p><p>working one acre or so each), who are more susceptible to </p><p>market disruptions than large plantation companies. </p><p>Furthermore, "low-grown" tea is farmed mainly in regions of </p><p>Sri Lanka\'s south where the left-wing JVP party is active. </p><p>GSL is particularly worried that a prolonged downturn in </p><p>"low-grown" tea sales will increase JVP support in the </p><p>region.  A large US tea purchase now, Kiriella said, would </p><p>help dampen this effect. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The Ambassador listened politely, but cautioned </p><p>Kiriella that his proposal was not likely to be a winning </p><p>one, particularly on short notice. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Kiriella added that GSL intends to make its own </p><p>humanitarian grant of tea to Iraq.  But the amount GSL can </p><p>afford to give (about USD 50,000) will neither meet Iraqi </p><p>demand nor bring an appreciable benefit to affected farmers. </p><p>GSL therefore is requesting US assistance to buy a much </p><p>larger amount of tea, about USD 2 million worth. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Post is, of course, not recommending that the U.S. </p><p>purchase Sri Lankan tea in order to neutralize an upswing in </p><p>support for the opposition JVP.  Still, it is true that a </p><p>large-scale surge in support for the JVP could threaten a </p><p>delicate peace process.  Post believes the GSL is right to </p><p>be concerned about the effect of the war in Iraq on its </p><p>economy and, by implication, the nation\'s prospects for </p><p>peace. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Post further recognizes that the Department is </p><p>consumed with pressing humanitarian concerns in Iraq, and </p><p>that consumption of tea is not a matter of life and death </p><p>for the people of Iraq.  Nonetheless, the GSL proposal does </p><p>present an opportunity to offer comfort food to the people </p><p>of Iraq, while addressing a critical threat to the Sri </p><p>Lankan economy.  Post presents the proposal for the </p><p>Department\'s consideration as what would be a very small </p><p>part of the overall humanitarian assistance package for </p><p>Iraq.  If the Department is interested in this </p><p>unconventional idea, then it is true that a salutary effect </p><p>could be achieved by purchasing the tea at the April 8 </p><p>auction. </p><p> </p><p>Action Request </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Post requests the Department to examine whether a USD </p><p>2 million tea purchase from Sri Lanka fits into our overall </p><p>humanitarian assistance strategy for Iraq. Please advise. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
