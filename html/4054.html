<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002323 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037 DIEMOND </p><p>PASS USTR ROSA WHITAKER </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER AND CWILKENSON </p><p>USAID FOR MAJORIE COPSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Nearly 1,000 Zimdollar = 1 $US </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: Zimbabwe\'s currency has been falling.  At almost </p><p>Z$ 1,000/1 $US in parallel markets, the weak Zimdollar is </p><p>exacerbating the GoZ\'s forex crunch. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Buying Frenzy in Harare\'s Streets </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>2. The Zimdollar has been shedding a weekly 8-10 percent </p><p>lately, a far more pronounced decline than earlier this </p><p>year.  While the official rate of 55:1 has hardly budged, </p><p>the Zimdollar has lost most of its value in the last half- </p><p>year.  The Embassy cashier\'s rates, which reflect parallel </p><p>Zimdollar out-of-country amounts, tell the story: </p><p> </p><p>     Monthly Averages: </p><p>     Oct/2001       302/$US </p><p>     Jan/2002       316/$US </p><p>     April/2002     330/$US </p><p>     July/2002      685/$US </p><p> </p><p>     Weekly Rates: </p><p>     Oct 3, 2002    780/$US </p><p>     Oct 10,2002    860/$US </p><p>     Oct 17,2002    950/$US </p><p> </p><p>In the more desperate climate of Harare\'s streets, a US </p><p>dollar is now fetching around Z$ 1,200. </p><p> </p><p>3. We attribute the U.S. dollar\'s 215 percent appreciation </p><p>since October 2001 to the following: </p><p> </p><p>- Monetary Policy.  Money supply has grown by 102 percent </p><p>since October 2001, accounting for half the appreciation in </p><p>proportional terms (i.e., 2 Zimdollars/2002 supplanting 1 </p><p>Zimdollar/2001). </p><p> </p><p>- Expectations.  Zimbabwe\'s economy is projected to shrink 5- </p><p>10 percent in 2003 with no prospect of recovery.  The GoZ is </p><p>not expected to curb spending, tighten monetary policy, </p><p>devalue the official rate or eliminate price controls when </p><p>it unveils its 2003 budget proposal next month. </p><p> </p><p>- Safe Haven.  Bank accounts as well as short-term </p><p>government bonds pay only 25-40 percent interest, versus a </p><p>conservative inflation rate of 140 percent.  U.S. dollars </p><p>are an appealing defensive investment for small savers, who </p><p>are bidding up the price of the greenback. The mood is so </p><p>somber that psychological factors may be causing modest </p><p>short-term overshooting. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. As the de facto market-determined regime, the parallel </p><p>rate is trying to find equilibrium.  The official rate is </p><p>permanently in disequilibrium, since the GoZ does not </p><p>support it with foreign reserves or other means.  55:1 is a </p><p>theoretical (read: wishful) rather than fixed rate in any </p><p>conventional sense. </p><p> </p><p>5. The parallel Zimdollar\'s swift descent spells further </p><p>trouble for the GoZ, which desperately needs forex to buy </p><p>food, fuel and pharmaceuticals.  It makes imports </p><p>inaccessible for most Zimbabweans, causing reverberations </p><p>throughout the economy (e.g., 300 of 400 taxis with one </p><p>major company are presently grounded because car-owners </p><p>cannot afford imported replacement parts).  And it drives </p><p>down the U.S. dollar-denominated price of the country\'s </p><p>assets, diminishing the GoZ\'s yield when it barters or sells </p><p>shares in state holdings. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
