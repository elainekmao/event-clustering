Under headline "U.N. must stop murder of innocent </p><p>      civilians" the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" </p><p>      used its April 4 editorial to label President Bush and </p><p>      Tony Blair as "the real terrorists."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .It is sad that the American and British </p><p>      invasion forces have taken it upon themselves to kill </p><p>      civilians under the guise of pursuing democracy.  What </p><p>      democracy?  America is clearly after the resources of </p><p>      the Iraqi people and this is further heightened by the </p><p>      threats now being made on Iran and Syria.  We believe </p><p>      that the world cannot stand by and watch the senseless </p><p>      massacre of women and children by lunatics who have </p><p>      been allowed to hold weapons of mass destruction.  It </p><p>      is our view that the people who should be targeted for </p><p>      persecution in pursuit of peace in the world are the </p><p>      real terrorists - George Bush and his Chihuahua, Tony </p><p>      Blair.  We want to know where the United Nations is </p><p>      while all this is happening.  Members of the U.N. </p><p>      cannot be held to ransom by two countries that enjoy </p><p>      stronger economies. The world body has failed in its </p><p>      role as a watchdog. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
