<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 AMMAN 001495 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL, NEA/ARN, </p><p>NICOSIA PLEASE PASS TO COUNTRY ATTACHE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, JO, SANR </p><p>SUBJECT: 2002 INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL STRATEGY </p><p>REPORT FOR JORDAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  EMBASSY AMMAN\'S SUBMISSION FOR THE INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS </p><p>CONTROL STRATEGY REPORT (INSCR) FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>PART I:  SUMMARY </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  JORDAN REMAINS PRIMARILY A TRANSIT COUNTRY FOR ILLICIT DRUGS </p><p>BECAUSE OF ITS GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION BETWEEN DRUG PRODUCING </p><p>COUNTRIES TO THE NORTH AND DRUG CONSUMING COUNTRIES TO THE </p><p>SOUTH AND WEST.   IN THE PAST JORDANIANS THEMSELVES DID NOT </p><p>PRODUCE NOR CONSUME SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF ILLICIT DRUGS. </p><p>HOWEVER, JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE NOTED AN INCREASE IN THE </p><p>USE OF ILLICIT DRUGS IN JORDAN.  THE PRIMARY DRUG OF CHOICE IN </p><p>JORDAN IS HEROIN SMUGGLED IN FROM TURKEY.  THE TARGET </p><p>CONSUMER IS YOUNG UNIVERSITY AND HIGH SCHOOL AGED </p><p>INDIVIDUALS.  THOUGH THE AMOUNTS BELIEVED TO BE CONSUMED ARE </p><p>STILL RELATIVELY SMALL IN COMPARISON TO OTHER COUNTRIES, THE </p><p>AUTHORITIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIRECTION THIS NEW TREND </p><p>IS TAKING AND REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE </p><p>PROBLEM.  COOPERATION BETWEEN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, </p><p>PARTICULARLY LEBANON AND SYRIA IS ONGOING AND GROWING. </p><p>CONVERSELY, COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL IS DECREASING DUE TO THE </p><p>CONTINUING HOSTILITIES IN THE WESTBANK.  JORDAN IS A PARTY TO THE </p><p>1998 UN DRUG CONVENTION, ENFORCES STRICT ANTI-DRUG LAWS AND </p><p>CONTINUES TO RECEIVE VARYING DEGREES OF COOPERATION FROM </p><p>BORDERING STATES IN NARCOTICS INTERDICTION EFFORTS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>PART II:  STATUS OF COUNTRY </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT JORDAN WILL CHANGE FROM A </p><p>NARCOTICS TRANSIT COUNTRY TO A NARCOTICS PRODUCING COUNTRY </p><p>IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  STATISTICS PROVIDED BY THE PSD ANTI- </p><p>NARCOTICS DEPARTMENT SEEM TO CONFIRM THIS ASSESSMENT.  JORDAN </p><p>CONTINUES TO BE A TRANSIT COUNTRY FOR NARCOTICS, AND REMAINS </p><p>VULNERABLE TO ILLICIT DRUG SMUGGLING THROUGH ITS VAST DESERT </p><p>BORDERS.  JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE INCREASE IN HEROIN </p><p>USE AND SALES ARE DRIVEN BY YOUNG PEOPLE SUPPORTING THEIR </p><p>HABITS AND NOT NECESSARILY A PROFIT MAKING VENTURE. </p><p> </p><p>4. AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS, JORDAN REMAINS A COUNTRY WITHOUT </p><p>NARCOTICS RELATED MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS.  THE CENTRAL BANK </p><p>HOWEVER, HAS INFORMED LOCAL BANKS REGARDING MONEY </p><p>LAUNDERING SCHEMES.  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS FEAR THE LACK </p><p>OF SUCH LAWS WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO MORE AGGRESSIVE </p><p>TRAFFICKING WITH POTENTIAL FOR MONEY LAUNDERING. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>PART III: COUNTRY ACTIONS AGAINST DRUGS IN 2002 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>5.  POLICY INITIATIVES: </p><p> </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASED USAGE OF HEROIN AMONG SCHOOL AND </p><p>UNIVERSITY AGED INDIVIDUALS, JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE </p><p>LAUNCHED A WIDE SPREAD AWARENESS CAMPAIGN IN AN ATTEMPT TO </p><p>EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE PERILS OF DRUG USE.  LAST YEAR OVER </p><p>300 PRESENTATIONS WERE MADE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AT SCHOOLS </p><p>AND UNIVERSITIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN\'S PUBLIC SECURITY DIRECTORATE (PSD) MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE </p><p>ANTI-NARCOTICS AND COUNTERFEITING BUREAU.  IN 2002 THE BUREAU </p><p>ADDED AN ADDITIONAL 16 OFFICERS TO HELP COMBAT THE CONTINUING </p><p>NARCOTICS TRANSIT SITUATION AND INCREASING HEROIN USAGE </p><p>PROBLEM.  FURTHERMORE, THE PSD ARE HOPING TO HOST A REGIONAL </p><p>ANTI-NARCOTICS TRAINING SEMINAR IN JULY OF 2003 </p><p> </p><p>THOUGH PSD STATISTICS INDICATE A REDUCTION IN HEROIN SEIZURES </p><p>AND AN INCREASE IN OPIUM SEIZURES, OFFICIALS ARE CLEARLY MORE </p><p>CONCERNED WITH AN INCREASE IN HEROIN USAGE, ESPECIALLY IN THE </p><p>MORE AFFLUENT AREA OF AQABA, RAMTHA AND WEST AMMAN. </p><p>OFFICIALS REPORT THAT ALTHOUGH THE USAGE OF HEROIN IS STILL </p><p>WELL BELOW THAT OF OTHER COUNTRIES, THE TREND IS OBVIOUS AND </p><p>THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE PROBLEM.  ONE </p><p>STATISTIC THAT APPEARS TO JUSTIFY THEIR CONCERN INDICATES THAT </p><p>TEN YEARS AGO, NO OVERDOSE DEATHS WERE REPORTED IN JORDAN.  IN </p><p>2002, THERE WERE MORE THAN 20 DEATHS ATTRIBUTED TO DRUG OVER </p><p>DOSE. </p><p> </p><p>THE PSD MAINTAINS LIAISON CHANNELS WITH COUNTER-NARCOTICS </p><p>OFFICERS IN LEBANON AND SYRIA TO INTERCEPT TRANSITIONAL </p><p>SHIPMENTS OF DRUGS.  THE PSD NARCOTICS LIAISON OFFICER DETAILED </p><p>TO THE JORDANIAN EMBASSY IN SAUDI ARABIA CONTINUES TO </p><p>COORDINATE NARCOTICS INVESTIGATIONS WITH SAUDI COUNTER- </p><p>NARCOTICS AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  CORRUPTION: </p><p> </p><p>JORDANIAN OFFICIALS REPORT NO NARCOTIC RELATED CORRUPTION OR </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD.  THERE IS CURRENTLY NO </p><p>EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT SENIOR LEVEL OFFICIALS ARE INVOLVED IN </p><p>NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING. </p><p>8.  AGREEMENTS AND TREATIES: </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN REMAINS COMMITTED TO EXISTING BILATERAL AGREEMENTS </p><p>PROVIDING FOR SOME COUNTER-NARCOTICS COOPERATION BETWEEN </p><p>SYRIA, LEBANON, IRAQ, SAUDI ARABIA, TURKEY, EGYPT, PAKISTAN AND </p><p>HUNGARY.  JORDAN IS A PARTY TO THE WORLD CUSTOMS </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE FOR THE PREVENTION, INVESTIGATION </p><p>AND REPRESSION OF CUSTOMS OFFENSES (NAIROBI CONVENTION), ANNEX </p><p>X ON ASSISTANCE IN NARCOTICS CASES. </p><p> </p><p>9. CULTIVATION AND PRODUCTION: </p><p> </p><p>EXISTING LAWS PROHIBIT THE CULTIVATION AND OR PRODUCTION OF </p><p>NARCOTICS IN JORDAN.  THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVELY </p><p>ENFORCED. </p><p> </p><p>10.  DRUG FLOW AND TRANSIT: </p><p> </p><p>JORDAN HAS BEEN AND REMAINS PRIMARILY A NARCOTICS TRANSIT </p><p>COUNTRY.  JORDAN IS BORDERED BY NARCOTICS PRODUCING COUNTRIES </p><p>TO THE NORTH AND NARCOTICS CONSUMING COUNTRIES TO THE SOUTH </p><p>AND WEST.  JORDAN\'S PRIMARY CHALLENGE IN STEMMING THE FLOW OF </p><p>NARCOTICS THROUGH THE COUNTRY REMAINS THE REMOTE, LONG AND </p><p>OPEN BORDERS WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  WHILE LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS CONFIRM SUBSTANTIAL COOPERATION WITH </p><p>IT\'S NEIGHBORS, THE VAST AND DESOLATE BORDER REGIONS AND THE </p><p>NOMADIC TRIBES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRAFFICKING OF NARCOTICS </p><p>MAKES INTERDICTION EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.  NONE OF THE NARCOTICS </p><p>TRANSITING JORDAN ARE BELIEVED TO BE DESTINED FOR THE UNITED </p><p>STATES. </p><p> </p><p>11.  DOMESTIC PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p>JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES ARE FOCUSED ON AWARENESS AND </p><p>EDUCATION, INTERDICTION AND REHABILITATION.  JORDANIAN </p><p>OFFICIALS HAVE INSTITUTED A ROBUST AWARENESS PROGRAM LARGELY </p><p>IN RESPONSE TO THE APPARENT INCREASE IN HEROIN USE.  JORDANIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES ARE ALSO INCREASING REHABILITATION ABILITIES.  WITH </p><p>UNITED NATIONS ASSISTANCE, JORDAN IS MODERNIZING ITS DRUG </p><p>TREATMENT CENTERS TO INCLUDE PRIVATE HOSPITALS. </p><p> </p><p>IN 2001, THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH OPENED ITS SECOND REHABILITATION </p><p>CENTER, THE NATIONAL REHABILITATION CENTER, IN SHAFRA BEIDA, A </p><p>SUBURB OF AMMAN.  THE NEW FACILITY OFFERS BEDS FOR THE </p><p>TREATMENT OF 60 ADDICTS.  FURTHERMORE, INDIVIDUALS TREATED IN </p><p>THE FACILITIES WILL NOT BE PROSECUTED ON NARCOTICS RELATED </p><p>CHARGES. </p><p> </p><p>FURTHERMORE, CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS NORMS CANNOT BE RULED </p><p>OUT AS A FACTOR IN THE HELP TO CONTROL DRUG USE.  THE ANTI- </p><p>NARCOTICS UNIT WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>MUSLIM AFFAIRS AND HOLY PLACES, WHICH DIRECTS RELIGIOUS </p><p>SPEECHES, LESSONS AND LECTURES ON AWARENESS OF DRUGS AND </p><p>THEIR EFFECTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>PART IV:  USG POLICY INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  POLICY INITIATIVES: </p><p> </p><p>CREATING AN EFFECTIVE JORDANIAN INTERDICTION FORCE REMAINS A </p><p>PRIMARY GOAL OF U.S.-JORDAN COOPERATION.  THE JORDANIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO ITS EFFORTS TO COMBAT PRODUCTION, </p><p>TRAFFICKING AND ABUSE OF NARCOTICS.  JORDANIAN OFFICIALS ALSO </p><p>CONFIRM THE GOVERNMENTS COMMITMENT TOWARDS PREVENTION AND </p><p>TREATMENT IN ORDER TO STEM THE SPREAD OF NARCOTICS IN JORDAN. </p><p> </p><p>13.  BILATERAL COOPERATION: </p><p> </p><p>DEA COUNTRY ATTACHI IN CYPRUS AND NARCOR HAVE A CLOSE </p><p>WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH JORDAN AUTHORITIES ON NARCOTICS </p><p>RELATED MATTERS.  THE UNITED STATES AND JORDAN DO NOT HAVE A </p><p>BILATERAL NARCOTICS AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE ROAD AHEAD: </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY OFFICIALS EXPECT CONTINUED COOPERATION WITH </p><p>JORDANIAN OFFICIALS IN ANTI-NARCOTICS RELATED ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>PART V:  STATISTICAL TABLES </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  AS JORDAN DOES NOT GROW NOR PRODUCE ILLICIT DRUGS. </p><p>THERE ARE NO STATISTICS REGARDING THE CULTIVATION AND </p><p>ERADICATION OF ILLICIT DRUGS </p><p> </p><p>CALENDAR YEAR       -- 2000          -- 2001          -- 2002 </p><p>SEIZURES: </p><p> </p><p>A.  HASHISH               298.456KG   788.731KG    866.407KG </p><p>B.  HEROIN                 127.713KG    35.528KG     14.666KG </p><p>C.  OPIUM                    41.150KG     0.327KG       19.326KG </p><p>D.  COCAINE               0.804KG       0.203KG       0.188KG </p><p> </p><p>CASES:            851                 1241             128 </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>MONEY LAUNDERING </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  MONEY LAUNDERING AS RELATED TO NARCOTICS IS NOT A CRIME IN </p><p>JORDAN.  JORDANIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS REMAIN </p><p>SUPPORTIVE OF SUCH LEGISLATION. HOWEVER, OFFICIALS DO NOT </p><p>BELIEVE JORDAN IS CURRENTLY A COUNTRY TARGETED BY MONEY </p><p>LAUNDERS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  THERE ARE NO LAWS COMPELLING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO </p><p>ADVISE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OF LARGE CURRENCY DEPOSITS </p><p>OR OTHER SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS IN RELATION TO NARCOTICS </p><p>CRIMES.  HOWEVER, JORDANIAN SOURCES REPORT SOME COOPERATION </p><p>BETWEEN PROSECUTORS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CONCERNING </p><p>REQUESTS FOR FINANCIAL DATA RELATED TO NARCOTICS CRIMES. </p><p>JORDAN IS NOT CONSIDERED A REGIONAL FINANCIAL CENTER. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>CHEMICAL CONTROL </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  THERE IS NO CONFIRMED PRODUCTION OF PRECURSOR OR ESSENTIAL </p><p>CHEMICALS IN JORDAN.  THERE WERE NO REPORTED SEIZURES OF </p><p>CHEMICALS OR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN 2002. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
