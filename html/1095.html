SUMMARY: VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE VIETNAMESE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY PHAN QUANG CALLED IN THE AMBASSADOR MAY 18 TO </p><p>PROTEST HOUSE RESOLUTION 295, WHICH CRITICIZED VIETNAM FOR </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND POLITICAL REPRESSION.  ON BEHALF </p><p>OF THE ASSEMBLY, QUANG "REJECTED" THE RESOLUTION, AND IN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01193  01 OF 02  010957Z </p><p>PARTICULAR CONGRESSIONAL CRITICISM OF ARTICLE 4 OF THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE CONSTITUTION, WHICH ENSHRINES THE COMMUNIST PARTY </p><p>AS THE COUNTRY\'S ONLY POLITICAL PARTY.  QUANG SAID THE </p><p>RESOLUTION "HINDERED THE PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION OF </p><p>RELATIONS" BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM.  FOLLOWING THE </p><p>MEETING, VIETNAMESE MEDIA WIDELY REPORTED HIS REMARKS, IN A </p><p>MUCH MORE STRIDENT TONE THAN GIVEN BY QUANG.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>REITERATED THAT IN THE UNITED STATES, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS </p><p>FREELY EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND THAT THE U.S. WOULD CONTINUE </p><p>TO WORK FOR NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.  HE AGREED HE WOULD </p><p>PASS ON QUANG\'S VIEWS TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR CALLED IN TO PROTEST HOUSE RESOLUTION </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>2. PHAN QUANG, ONE OF THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY, REQUESTED A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR MAY 18 TO </p><p>PROTEST HOUSE RESOLUTION 295, "RELATING TO CONTINUING HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND POLITICAL REPRESSION IN THE SOCIALIST </p><p>REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM."  THE RESOLUTION PASSED MAY 3 BY A VOTE </p><p>OF 415 TO 3.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE RESOLUTION CALLS ON </p><p>THE PRESIDENT TO "RESTATE AND MAKE CLEAR" TO VIETNAMESE </p><p>LEADERS THAT "THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FIRMLY COMMITTED TO </p><p>POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM" FOR VIETNAM\'S </p><p>CITIZENS.  QUANG SAID A NUMBER OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>DELEGATES, WHO ARE MEETING FOR ONE OF THEIR TWO MONTH-LONG </p><p>SESSIONS DURING MAY, HAD EXPRESSED ANGER WITH THE </p><p>RESOLUTION, AND HE HAD BEEN ASKED TO SHARE THESE CONCERNS </p><p>WITH THE AMBASSADOR. </p><p> </p><p>3. THOUGH QUANG WAS POLITE AND MILD-MANNERED DURING HIS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01193  01 OF 02  010957Z </p><p>REMARKS, HE READ FROM A PREPARED TEXT IN STRONGLY </p><p>CRITICIZING THE U.S. CONGRESS FOR "BRAZEN INTERFERENCE" IN </p><p>VIETNAM\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS.  QUANG CLAIMED THAT </p><p>"REGRETTABLY, THE MOVE OF THE (HOUSE) HAS, FAR FROM MAKING </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS, HINDERED THE PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION OF </p><p>RELATIONS" BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM.  HE CLAIMED VIETNAM </p><p>HAS NO POLITICAL PRISONERS OR "PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE," AS </p><p>NOTED IN THE RESOLUTION; HE SAID ALL OF THOSE IMPRISONED IN </p><p>VIETNAM HAD BEEN CONVICTED ACCORDING TO VIETNAMESE LAW. </p><p> </p><p>4. QUANG SAID ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WERE PARTICULARLY ANGERED BY </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL CRITICISM OF ARTICLE 4 OF THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>CONSTITUTION, WHICH ENSHRINES THE COMMUNIST PARTY (CPV) AS </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S ONLY POLITICAL PARTY.  (NOTE: 85 PERCENT OF </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY ARE CPV MEMBERS.)  QUANG SAID THE </p><p>CPV HAD PLAYED THE LEADING ROLE IN VIETNAM\'S STRUGGLE FOR </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, FREEDOM AND REUNIFICATION, AND IN CARRYING OUT </p><p>"DOI MOI" (RENOVATION) REFORMS SINCE THE MID-1980\'S.  HE </p><p>CLAIMED THE RESOLUTION\'S CALL FOR VIETNAM TO HOLD "FREE AND </p><p>HONEST ELECTIONS" WAS NOT SOMETHING DEMANDED BY THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, SINCE THE PEOPLE HAD SHOWN THEIR SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE CVP SINCE THE "NATIONAL LIBERATION" STRUGGLE.  HE </p><p>SAID THIS WAS A "GROSS VIOLATION" OF THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE\'S </p><p>RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF CHOICE AS EXPRESSED IN LAST NOVEMBER\'S </p><p>NATION-WIDE GENERAL ELECTIONS FOR PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL SEATS. </p><p>(COMMENT: THOSE ELECTIONS, PARTICIPATION IN WHICH WAS </p><p>MANDATORY FOR CITIZENS, WERE CONDUCTED WITH NO TRANSPARENCY </p><p>IN THE VOTE COUNTING.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>5. THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT IN THE UNITED STATES </p><p>MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE FREE TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND THAT </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01193  01 OF 02  010957Z </p><p>THIS RESOLUTION WAS ADOPTED BY MANY MEMBERS.  HE SAID THAT, </p><p>DESPITE THE CRITICAL TONE OF THE RESOLUTION, MOST AMERICANS </p><p>AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WERE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK </p><p>FOR FULL NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.  HE NOTED THE U.S. </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>6. AFTER THE MEETING, THE EMBASSY WAS INFORMED THAT THE </p><p>MEETING WOULD BE PUBLICIZED IN THE PRESS.  OVER THE NEXT </p><p>SEVERAL DAYS, VIETNAMESE STATE-CONTROLLED NEWSPAPERS, RADIO </p><p>AND PRIME-TIME EVENING NEWS ON TELEVISION USED THE MEETING </p><p>TO BLAST THE CONGRESS FOR THE RESOLUTION.  THE CPV </p><p>MOUTHPIECE "NHAN DAN" (THE PEOPLE) AND OTHER PAPERS BLASTED </p><p>THE "ARROGANT INTERVENTION" AND "ABSURD DEMANDS" OF THE </p><p>RESOLUTION. </p><p> </p><p>7. COMMENT: VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT AND CPV CRITICISM OF THE </p><p>U.S. OVER ACTIVISM ON HUMAN RIGHTS IS PAR FOR THE COURSE IN </p><p>HANOI, THOUGH THIS PROTEST WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG.  PART OF </p><p>THE REASON IS THAT CRITICIZING THE LEADING ROLE OF THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY GOES WHERE NO VIETNAMESE IS ALLOWED TO GO. </p><p>SUCH CRITICISM IS SEEN AS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE, SINCE IN </p><p>VIETNAM THE CPV\'S "LEADING ROLE" IS SACROSANCT.  ALSO A "HOT </p><p>BUTTON" ISSUE IS SRV CONCERN OVER THE RESOLUTION\'S APPROVING </p><p>WORDS ABOUT THE INITIATION IN WESTMINSTER, CALIFORNIA OF A </p><p>MEMORIAL TO AMERICAN AND SOUTH VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS WHO </p><p>"SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES FOR THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM DURING THE </p><p>VIETNAM WAR."  AS NOTED EARLIER SEPTEL, LIKE THE PARTY\'S </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01193  02 OF 02  010957Z </p><p>LEADING ROLE, THE OFFICIAL VIEW OF THE "NATIONAL LIBERATION" </p><p>VICTORY IS A THIRD RAIL OF VIETNAMESE POLITICS.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. ACTION REQUEST: QUANG ASKED THE AMBASSADOR TO SHARE HIS </p><p>MESSAGE WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, AND WE REQUEST H TO SHARE </p><p>THIS MESSAGE WITH INTERESTED MEMBERS AND STAFF. </p><p>PETERSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
