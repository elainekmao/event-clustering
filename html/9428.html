As requested reftel, post </p><p>has also sent the ICS via email to EB/IFD/OIA. </p><p> </p><p>2.Begin text of the 2003 Investment Climate Statement </p><p>for Vietnam: </p><p> </p><p>INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT - 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>A1. Openness to Foreign Investment </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. Vietnam, in principle, maintains a policy of </p><p>encouragement of foreign investment.  A crucial element in </p><p>its long-term development strategy is the continued ability </p><p>to attract and utilize relatively large amounts of overseas </p><p>capital, both foreign direct investment (FDI) and official </p><p>development assistance (ODA).   (Vietnam does not yet allow </p><p>any significant foreign portfolio investment.)  For the </p><p>2001-2005 period, the Government of Vietnam (GVN) has </p><p>established targets for FDI at US$ 11 billion in </p><p>disbursements from existing and newly licensed foreign </p><p>investments and for approximately US$ 10-11 billion in ODA </p><p>disbursed by foreign donors, for a total of US$ 21-22 </p><p>billion from foreign sources, the levels of FDI and ODA it </p><p>estimates are required to support the government\'s GDP </p><p>growth target of 7.5 percent per year. </p><p> </p><p>2.  By April 2003, Vietnam had attracted nearly US$ 39 </p><p>billion in investment commitments since the country was </p><p>opened to foreign investment in 1988.  Approximately US$22 </p><p>billion, or 56 percent, of that amount has been disbursed </p><p>in more than 3,897 projects.   Sixty-four percent of </p><p>disbursed investment was made into projects concentrated in </p><p>or near the two major cities of Ho Chi Minh City in the </p><p>south and Hanoi in the north.  U.S. businesses have </p><p>received 163 investment licenses for projects worth US$ </p><p>1,128 million and have injected US$563 million thus far </p><p>into Vietnam.  Significant additional U.S. investment is </p><p>counted as investment from third countries in cases where, </p><p>for example, the investment involves a third-country </p><p>subsidiary of a U.S. company. </p><p> </p><p>3.  As the GVN continues to proceed with its long-standing </p><p>policy of reform of the economy, openness to foreign </p><p>business, and integration of the nation into the world </p><p>economy, Vietnam\'s rapidly growing population of 79 million </p><p>should become an increasingly attractive investment </p><p>destination.  Vietnam entered into the Asia-Pacific </p><p>Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in late 1998.  It is </p><p>committed to enter into and fully comply with its </p><p>obligations under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) by 2006. </p><p>In addition, it is currently engaged in negotiations to </p><p>join the World Trade Organization (WTO).  Perhaps the </p><p>strongest recent signals of the country\'s commitment to </p><p>economic reform and improving business climate were entry- </p><p>into-force of the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement </p><p>(BTA) in December 2001 and completion of agreements on </p><p>economic reform with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) </p><p>and World Bank also in 2001.  In light of Vietnam\'s strong </p><p>macroeconomic performance despite the global economic </p><p>downturn and continued progress on economic reform, </p><p>Standard and Poor\'s assigned Vietnam\'s foreign and local </p><p>currency bonds a BB minus long term and a B minus short </p><p>term rating and labeled the long term outlook stable. </p><p>Moody\'s assigned Vietnam a B1 long-term rating and, in June </p><p>2002, labeled  its outlook  positive.  These developments, </p><p>taken together with the country\'s relatively low-wage work </p><p>force and natural resource base, are convincing foreign </p><p>investors to consider Vietnam when looking for their next </p><p>investment location </p><p> </p><p>4. However, despite an official policy encouraging foreign </p><p>investment and a solid economic performance, Vietnam </p><p>remains a difficult investment environment and potential </p><p>investors should carefully scrutinize any investment plans. </p><p>Currently in a period of transition from a command economy </p><p>to a \'state-supervised\' market economy in which the state </p><p>sector retains a \'leading role,\' Vietnam is implementing a </p><p>series of gradual reforms that will enable the economy to </p><p>function more efficiently.  As the GVN engages in this </p><p>complex process, foreign investors must cope with a wide </p><p>range of problems and costs.  These include poorly </p><p>developed infrastructure, underdeveloped and cumbersome </p><p>legal and financial systems, an unwieldy bureaucracy, non- </p><p>transparent regulations, high start-up costs, arcane land </p><p>acquisition and transfer regulations and procedures, and </p><p>shortage of trained personnel.  Issuance of investment </p><p>licenses can be a lengthy process.  Moreover, investment </p><p>projects in both pre- and post-establishment phases must </p><p>cope with frequent changes in the investment environment in </p><p>areas such as taxes, tariffs, import and export policies </p><p>and procedures.  Additionally, the Vietnamese courts have </p><p>so far proved unwilling or unable to enforce laws related </p><p>to investor protections, in particular, the enforcement of </p><p>arbitral awards.  Finally, investors cite official </p><p>corruption as a significant problem in establishing and </p><p>running their business.  In particular, investments </p><p>involving joint ventures with State-owned enterprises have </p><p>proven especially vulnerable to corruption and abuse. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Foreign investment in Vietnam is regulated by the </p><p>Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) through the Law </p><p>on Foreign Investment (LFI) and related implementing </p><p>regulations, decrees, and circulars.   It was first </p><p>introduced in 1989 when the country was opened up to </p><p>investment and was followed by a series of amendments and </p><p>supplements in order to improve the climate for foreign </p><p>investors.  The latest guiding regulation is Governmental </p><p>Decree Number 27 issued in March 2003.  It provides </p><p>amendments of and to the 2000 Decree Number 24, which </p><p>promulgated detailed regulations on the implementation of </p><p>the LFI.  It includes an explicit pledge against </p><p>expropriation , guarantees the right to repatriate profits, </p><p>and states the GVN\'s intent to treat private and State </p><p>sectors equally.  The law provides significant fiscal and </p><p>tax incentives to attract foreign capital. </p><p> </p><p>6. There are four primary forms of investment for </p><p>foreigners in Vietnam: </p><p> </p><p>a)  Joint venture (JV) agreements  pair foreign and local </p><p>companies sharing capital and profits.  The contribution of </p><p>the local company, typically a State-owned enterprise </p><p>(SOE), to the JV frequently consists solely of land use </p><p>rights.  The minimum percentage of foreign involvement in a </p><p>JV is 30 percent, but examples of JVs where the foreign </p><p>partner is not a majority shareholder are rare.  The </p><p>minority partner retains veto power over the majority </p><p>partner concerning selection of senior management and </p><p>changes in the JV charter.  However, under the BTA these </p><p>rights will be phased out within three years of entry into </p><p>force of the agreement for U.S. investors.  Joint ventures </p><p>account for the majority of foreign investment to date  as </p><p>many investors find JVs attractive because they can benefit </p><p>from the assistance of an established Vietnamese firm in </p><p>dealing with bureaucratic and administrative procedures. </p><p>They also provide  foreign investors access to land which </p><p>may otherwise be difficult to secure.  Some investors </p><p>complain the government allows local partners to overvalue </p><p>their land use rights. </p><p> </p><p>b)  Business Cooperation Contracts (BCC) permit a foreign </p><p>firm to pursue business interests in cooperation with a </p><p>Vietnamese firm by investing capital and sharing revenues </p><p>without conferring the right of establishment or ownership. </p><p>In many respects, it is the most flexible arrangement </p><p>Vietnam offers to foreign investors.  However, a BCC </p><p>license typically does not contain tax holidays or </p><p>concessions given to other types of foreign investments. </p><p>BCC\'s have predominated in the telecommunications sector </p><p>and, as production sharing contracts, in the petroleum </p><p>sector, where the government limits foreign involvement in </p><p>operations and management. </p><p> </p><p>c)  100-percent Foreign-Owned Enterprises have become more </p><p>popular recently, as investors have learned to navigate the </p><p>local system on their own.  The GVN has shown increasing </p><p>willingness to permit them on a case-by-case basis, </p><p>particularly in industrial production for export. </p><p> </p><p>d)  Build-operate-transfer (BOT) agreements are the least </p><p>commonly used form of foreign investment.  While authorized </p><p>under the LFI and specific BOT legislation, the legal, </p><p>regulatory, and financial framework for BOT\'s remains </p><p>incomplete. The LFI also recognizes build-operate-own </p><p>(BOO), build-transfer-operate (BTO), and build-transfer </p><p>(BT) forms of investment.  Under a BOT agreement the </p><p>investor builds an infrastructure project, operates it for </p><p>an agreed period of time to recover the investment and earn </p><p>a profit, and then cedes it to the government without </p><p>further compensation.  Several foreign-invested BOT </p><p>licenses have been granted, but many others have been held </p><p>up in protracted negotiations.  The most intractable BOT </p><p>issues have been financing, product pricing and government </p><p>regulatory and cost-recovery guarantees. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Foreign investors have pressured the Vietnamese </p><p>government for years to expand the permissible forms of </p><p>foreign investment.  The Ministry of Planning and </p><p>Investment (MPI) has submitted to the Government the final </p><p>draft of the decree providing for the establishment of new </p><p>foreign invested shareholding companies (FISCs) and the </p><p>conversion of existing foreign invested enterprises into </p><p>FISCs, in which both foreign and Vietnamese investors may </p><p>purchase shares (subject to maximum 30% foreign </p><p>shareholding). Currently 24 foreign invested enterprises </p><p>operating in Vietnam are seeking permission to convert to a </p><p>FISC, though it not known in which sectors FISCs will be </p><p>permitted. However no approval has been issued to date. </p><p> </p><p>Recent reforms under the Government Decree Number 27 issued </p><p>in March 2003 include: </p><p> </p><p>A new 100% Foreign Owned Enterprise (FOE) may now be formed </p><p>between an existing FOE and (i) another existing FOE and/or </p><p>(ii) new foreign investor(s); </p><p>A Business Cooperation Contract may now be established by </p><p>an existing joint venture enterprise or an existing FOE </p><p>with another foreign organization or individual; </p><p>A new Joint Venture Enterprise (JVE) may now be established </p><p>between an existing FOE and a Vietnamese enterprise or </p><p>between an existing FOE and an existing JVE. However, a JVE </p><p>may not be established between an existing FOE and a </p><p>foreign investor or an overseas Vietnamese investor. </p><p> </p><p>Decree 27 also abolishes the restriction that any legal </p><p>capital (equity) in the form of technology transfer must </p><p>not exceed 20% of legal capital, and is subject only to </p><p>agreement by the parties of the company. </p><p> </p><p>8.  At present the Government maintains an extensive </p><p>investment licensing process which is characterized by </p><p>stringent and time-consuming requirements that are </p><p>frequently used to protect domestic interests, limit </p><p>competition and allocate foreign investment rights among </p><p>various countries.   The Ministry of Planning and </p><p>Investment (MPI) is the primary point of contact for most </p><p>foreign investors.  But Vietnam currently does not offer a </p><p>\'one-stop shop\' for investment negotiation and approval. </p><p>Foreign investors typically must contact and obtain support </p><p>and/or approvals from a number of national and local </p><p>agencies; indeed, licensing approval is required from other </p><p>ministries or government bodies which regulate particular </p><p>sectors, especially oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, financial </p><p>services.  In addition, investors may not always be aware </p><p>of all regulatory requirements for licenses, which has led </p><p>at times to complaints of unfair or discriminatory </p><p>treatment.   Licensing is required not only for </p><p>establishment, but also in order to make significant </p><p>changes to an operating concern such as increase investment </p><p>capital, restructure the company by changing the form of </p><p>investment or investment ratios between foreign and </p><p>domestic partners, or add additional business activities. </p><p> </p><p>9.   In the early 1990\'s, all foreign investment projects </p><p>required approval by the Prime Minister.  Overtime, in an </p><p>effort to reduce obstacles to foreign investment, this list </p><p>of projects subject to approval at the highest levels was </p><p>reduced.  At present, Prime Ministerial approval is </p><p>required for investment licenses for the following: </p><p> </p><p>projects with investment capital in excess of US$ 40 </p><p>million in electricity; mining, metallurgy, cement, </p><p>mechanical engineering, manufacture, chemicals, hotels, </p><p>apartments for lease, tourism and entertainment; </p><p>projects of any value in the following sectors: </p><p>Infrastructure construction of industrial zones (IZ) and </p><p>export processing zones (EPZ), urban areas, build-operate- </p><p>transfer, build-transfer-operate and build-transfer </p><p>projects; </p><p>Construction and operation of seaports and airports; </p><p>operation of sea and air transportation; </p><p>Oil and gas; </p><p>Post and telecommunications services; </p><p>Culture; including publishing, press; radio and television </p><p>broadcasting; medical examination and treatment </p><p>establishments; education and training; scientific research </p><p>and production of medicine for human diseases; </p><p>Insurance, finance, auditing and inspection; </p><p>Exploration and exploitation of rare and precious natural </p><p>resources; </p><p>Construction of residences for sale; and, </p><p>National defense and security projects. </p><p> </p><p>projects that use five hectares or more of urban land or 50 </p><p>hectares or more of rural land. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Vietnamese authorities evaluate investment license </p><p>applications using a number of criteria including: </p><p> </p><p>the legal status and financial capabilities of the foreign </p><p>and Vietnamese investors; </p><p>the project\'s compatibility with Vietnam\'s \'Master Plan\' </p><p>for economic and social development; </p><p>the benefits accruing to the government or to the </p><p>Vietnamese party, especially acquisition of new production </p><p>capabilities, industries, technologies, expansion of </p><p>markets; and job creation; </p><p>projected revenue; </p><p>technology and expertise; </p><p>efficient use of resources; </p><p>environmental protection; </p><p>plans for land use and land clearance compensation; </p><p>project incentives including tax rates and land, water, and </p><p>sea surface rental fees. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Overtime, the GVN has gradually but steadily improved </p><p>its investment licensing regime.  Greater authority over </p><p>investment licensing has been devolved to provinces, </p><p>municipalities, and investment zones.   Provincial People\'s </p><p>committees now have authority to issue investment licenses </p><p>for projects not subject to Prime Ministerial approval </p><p>which do not exceed US$ 5 million in invested capital, or </p><p>US$ 10 million in invested capital in the areas of Hanoi </p><p>and Ho Chi Minh City.   MPI may also authorize Provincial </p><p>Industrial and Export Processing Zone Management Boards to </p><p>issue investment licenses for projects those projects which </p><p>are not subject to approval by the Prime Minister and not </p><p>exceeding US$ 40 million.   Several provincial committees </p><p>and IZ management boards have significantly streamlined </p><p>licensing procedures in their jurisdictions, reducing the </p><p>time to days if not hours in some cases.  While this </p><p>decentralization is frequently in the foreign investor\'s </p><p>favor, it has also given rise to considerable regional </p><p>differences in procedure and interpretation of relevant </p><p>investment law and regulation. </p><p> </p><p>12.   In addition, the 2000 amendment to the LFI added a </p><p>"Registration" licensing procedure where previously only an </p><p>"evaluation" or approval procedure had existed.  Under </p><p>Registration procedures:  projects cannot be refused a </p><p>license so long as all the necessary documents have been </p><p>submitted; the applicants are not required to submit a </p><p>detailed feasibility study; and the review time limit is </p><p>only 15 days compared to the 45-day period mandated for the </p><p>licensing via the Evaluation procedure.  Registration </p><p>procedures are only open to those projects which are not </p><p>subject to prime ministerial approval and/or environmental </p><p>impact assessment.  Furthermore, projects submitted for </p><p>Registration must satisfy at least one of the following </p><p>conditions: </p><p> </p><p>Export all products; </p><p>Invest in an IZ and satisfy all relevant export </p><p>requirements; or </p><p>Invest in the manufacturing sector, with invested capital </p><p>less than or equal to US$ 5 million and export at least 80% </p><p>of production. </p><p> </p><p>13.   Because it recognizes the need for increased foreign </p><p>direct investment if Vietnam is to reach the ambitious </p><p>development goal set out in the 2001-2010 Socio-Economic </p><p>Development strategy, the GVN has a policy of  trying to </p><p>improve the climate for investment, although that policy </p><p>does not always translate into concrete action.  Perhaps </p><p>the single most important event in Vietnam\'s recent </p><p>economic history is the entry-into-force of the U.S.- </p><p>Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA).   As Vietnam\'s </p><p>commitments in the BTA are implemented, it will help ensure </p><p>fair access and treatment for U.S. investment, goods and </p><p>services.   The BTA provides a broad range of benefits for </p><p>U.S. investment in Vietnam that should significantly </p><p>enhance the investment environment for U.S. firms.   A </p><p>major part of the BTA is devoted to investment which: </p><p>provides national and most-favored-nation treatment, except </p><p>where explicit exceptions have been made; guarantees access </p><p>to third-party investor-state dispute settlement; </p><p>disciplines trade-related investment measures; ensures </p><p>treatment of expropriation consistent with international </p><p>standards.  In addition, other chapters of the BTA will </p><p>reduce tariffs and quantitative restrictions on U.S. </p><p>investor\'s imports; permit U.S. investors to engage </p><p>directly in trade; require the government to operate more </p><p>transparently; open sectors of interest to U.S. business </p><p>including banking, insurance, professional services, </p><p>telecommunications, distribution, etc.; and provide </p><p>protection consistent with World Trade Organization (WTO)- </p><p>standards for U.S. investors\' intellectual property. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Also, a number of important policy decisions and legal </p><p>changes have been made which are intended to create a more </p><p>open, business friendly investment climate for foreign and </p><p>domestic private investment alike.  On December 25, 2001, </p><p>the National Assembly adopted changes to the Constitution </p><p>of 1992 which contained several business related items in </p><p>Articles 15 and 16.  One provided the constitutional basis </p><p>for Vietnam\'s integration into the international economy. </p><p>Another formally recognized the foreign direct investment </p><p>and the domestic private sectors as components within the </p><p>Vietnamese economy in addition to the already recognized </p><p>sector comprising SOEs.  Previously, the approach under </p><p>Vietnamese law was to permit business to only engage in </p><p>those activities for which they had explicit permission. </p><p>The amendment package formally stated the principle that </p><p>businesses could engage in all activities except those </p><p>prohibited by law.   These constitutional changes codified </p><p>at the Constitutional level, changes in approach with </p><p>respect to foreign and domestic private sector investment </p><p>contained in the economic reforms of the 1990\'s, lending </p><p>them a level of permanence that they had heretofore not </p><p>enjoyed. </p><p> </p><p>15.  In addition, in 2001-2002, hs, both the Government and </p><p>the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) issued policy </p><p>documents supportive of the private sector, domestic and </p><p>foreign.  In August 2001, the Government signaled its </p><p>intent to continue to improve the climate for foreign </p><p>investment when it issued a resolution calling for </p><p>continued efforts to improve Vietnam\'s attractiveness to </p><p>foreign investment in the next five years by: </p><p> </p><p>expanding of the sectors open to foreign investment, to </p><p>include the real estate, import services and domestic </p><p>distribution; </p><p>easing the conditions for foreign-ownership of equitized </p><p>state-owned enterprises; </p><p>permitting foreign invested enterprises (FIE\'s) to issue </p><p>stock to be sold on the local stock exchange; </p><p>facilitating foreign investors\' participation in BOT\'s; </p><p>narrowing the list of prohibited FIE exports; </p><p>establishment of a level playing field among foreign, </p><p>domestic private and state-owned enterprises; and </p><p>continuing reform of law and regulation on foreign </p><p>investment. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Perhaps more significantly, the CPV issued a </p><p>resolution in March 2002 clearly stating its support for a </p><p>mixed economy with equal treatment of foreign, private </p><p>domestic and state-owned enterprises.  In this document, </p><p>the CPV made several important recommendations which, when </p><p>translated into actual policy, will provide significant </p><p>support for the private sector in the future including: </p><p>continuing reforms to make it easier to do private </p><p>businesses; eliminating discriminatory treatment of </p><p>domestic or foreign private sector activity; making clear </p><p>distinctions between civil and criminal offenses so as to </p><p>avoid the prevalent criminalization of certain commercial </p><p>decisions and disputes; simplified lending procedures to </p><p>give private enterprise greater access to domestic credit; </p><p>and amendment of existing accounting procedures to </p><p>encourage private enterprise to perform financial audits </p><p>and disclose the results annually. </p><p> </p><p>17.   The above actions strongly indicate the Vietnamese </p><p>leadership\'s intention to continue to improve the country\'s </p><p>foreign investment climate, even if its efforts sometimes </p><p>fall short.  This effort began in 1989 when the country </p><p>adopted the Law on Foreign Investment (LFI) and has </p><p>continued with four major amendments of the LFI, the most </p><p>recent in 2000, and the issuance and amendment of numerous </p><p>implementing regulations.   Most recently, the GVN has </p><p>issued laws and regulations intended to facilitate foreign </p><p>investment by reducing or eliminating discrimination </p><p>against foreign investors in pricing for goods and </p><p>services, transfer requirements, use of land use rights for </p><p>mortgaging purposes, unanimity rules applying to certain </p><p>decisions made by joint venture boards, rights of first </p><p>sale and many others.   Many of these changes were mandated </p><p>under the BTA. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Nonetheless, many additional official measures that </p><p>discriminate against foreign investment  persist.  These </p><p>can be found listed among the permanent exceptions to the </p><p>non-discrimination obligations contained in the BTA </p><p>investment chapter. Some must be eliminated at a later date </p><p>under the BTA; others will remain indefinitely. </p><p>Additionally, Vietnam continues to impose unofficial and </p><p>arbitrary measures that negatively affect foreign investors </p><p>and in some cases, threaten their capital investments. </p><p> </p><p>19.  At present, most foreign importers are barred from </p><p>direct participation in Vietnam\'s distribution system, </p><p>although foreign investors have the right to sell, market, </p><p>and distribute what they manufacture locally.  Foreign </p><p>investors have the right to import goods needed for their </p><p>investment projects, provided this right is included in </p><p>their investment licenses, however, they must import the </p><p>goods through licensed Vietnamese import/export firms.  An </p><p>exception is made for foreign manufacturers importing </p><p>inputs directly to production when such import rights are </p><p>explicitly included in their investment licenses.  Under </p><p>the BTA, trading rights and market access in distribution </p><p>services for foreign investors will be gradually expanded. </p><p>While Vietnam has greatly expanded in recent years the </p><p>number of Vietnamese firms permitted import/export rights, </p><p>the vast majority of general import/export companies remain </p><p>SOE\'s. </p><p> </p><p>20.  The GVN holds regular \'business forum\' meetings with </p><p>domestic and foreign business associations to discuss </p><p>issues of importance to the private sector.  Foreign </p><p>investors use these meetings to draw attention to </p><p>impediments to investment and commerce imposed by </p><p>Vietnamese law and regulation as well as by improper </p><p>implementation.  These fora, together with frequent </p><p>dialogues between GVN officials and foreign investors held </p><p>between the semi-annual fora, have led to improved </p><p>communication and have sometimes allowed foreign investors </p><p>to make timely comments on and influence legal and </p><p>procedural reforms. </p><p> </p><p>21.  Foreign enterprises also have the right to apply to the </p><p>Ministry of Trade or the Service of Trade in Hanoi or Ho </p><p>Chi Minh City for a representative office license, which </p><p>gives foreign firms the right to conduct market research </p><p>and to pursue business interests, short of actually selling </p><p>products and services in Vietnam.  Foreign banks must apply </p><p>to the State Bank of Vietnam for representative office or </p><p>bank branch licenses. </p><p> </p><p>22. Previosly, Vietnam applied different corporate income </p><p>tax rates to foreign investors and to domestic enterprises </p><p>(being 25% and 32% respectively). The National Assembly in </p><p>its May 2003 session approved the Ministry of Finance </p><p>amendments to the Law on Corporate Income Tax, w.  which </p><p>provide for a uniform rate of 28% applied to foreign </p><p>invested and domestic businesses, representing a 3% </p><p>increase for foreign invested enterprises and a 4% </p><p>reduction for domestic companies. Tax incentives will also </p><p>be the same for both foreign invested and domestic </p><p>enterprises and will be offered to investors in selected </p><p>priority sectors and in remote areas. The Amended Law on </p><p>Corporate Income Tax is takes effects 1 January 2004. The </p><p>Ministry of Finance also proposed to abolish profit </p><p>remittance tax for foreign invested enterprises.    Foreign </p><p>investors have sought changes to the high personal income </p><p>tax rates for Vietnamese national employees in the higher </p><p>pay scales, which significantly increases the gross salary </p><p>employers must pay to maintain competitive and reasonable </p><p>take home salaries. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>A2.

Vietnam\'s foreign exchange regime has been </p><p>significantly improved with the amendments to the LFI (the </p><p>2000 Governmental Decree Number 24 and 2003 Decree Number </p><p>27), which explicitly gave foreign investors the right to </p><p>exchange local currency for foreign currency for the </p><p>purpose of meeting certain current transactions or </p><p>remitting certain categories of earnings.  In addition, </p><p>conversion of Vietnamese dong into hard currency no longer </p><p>requires a foreign exchange license.  Despite these </p><p>significant improvements, various subsequent decrees and </p><p>circulars issued by the State Bank continue to stipulate </p><p>conditions on, among other things, the opening of bank </p><p>accounts, conversion of Vietnamese Dong into foreign </p><p>currency, documentation requirements, and remittance of </p><p>foreign currency in and out of the country. </p><p> </p><p>24.  Foreign businesses are allowed to remit profits, </p><p>shared revenues from joint-ventures, incomes from services </p><p>and technology transfers, legally-owned capital and </p><p>properties in hard currency.  Foreigners also are allowed </p><p>to remit abroad royalties and fees paid for the supply of </p><p>technologies and services, principal and interest on loans </p><p>obtained for business operations, and investment capital </p><p>and other money and assets under their legitimate </p><p>ownership.  But their ability to convert dong into hard </p><p>currency is subject to availability, causing Foreign- </p><p>invested-enterprises (FIEs) to experience problems in </p><p>securing hard currency.  No information on average delays </p><p>in remitting investment returns is available.  Approval by </p><p>investment authorities is needed to increase or decrease </p><p>the capital of a foreign-invested business. </p><p> </p><p>25.  In principle, most FIEs are expected to be \'self- </p><p>sufficient\' for their foreign exchange requirements, </p><p>although this sometimes proves impractical.  Government of </p><p>Vietnam guarantees to assist in the balancing of foreign </p><p>currency for foreign invested enterprises and foreign </p><p>business cooperation parties that invest in the </p><p>construction of infrastructure and certain other important </p><p>projects in the event that banks permitted to trade foreign </p><p>currency are unable to fully satisfy their foreign currency </p><p>demand. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>A.3. Expropriation and Compensation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>26.  The U.S. Embassy knows of no recent instances of </p><p>expropriation of a foreign investment by the Government of </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>27.  Under the BTA, in any future case of expropriation or </p><p>nationalization of U.S. investor assets, Vietnam will be </p><p>obligated to apply international standards of treatment - </p><p>that is taking such an action for a public purpose; in a </p><p>non-discriminatory manner; in accordance with due process </p><p>of law; and with payment of prompt, adequate and effective </p><p>compensation. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>A.4. Dispute settlement </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>28. Vietnam\'s legal system, including dispute and claims </p><p>settlement mechanisms, remains underdeveloped and sometimes </p><p>biased against foreign entities.  Negotiation between the </p><p>concerned parties is the most common and preferred means of </p><p>dispute resolution.  Although contracts are extremely </p><p>difficult to enforce in Vietnam, particularly if one party </p><p>to a dispute is a foreigner, investors generally should </p><p>negotiate and include dispute resolution procedures in </p><p>their contracts.  However, even with such provisions, </p><p>resolution is not guaranteed. </p><p> </p><p>29.  In the event of an investment dispute, there are a </p><p>number of domestic avenues available.  Economic courts, in </p><p>addition to hearing bankruptcy cases, also have </p><p>jurisdiction over cases involving business disputes. </p><p>Administrative courts hear cases that concern alleged </p><p>infractions of administrative procedures by government </p><p>authorities.  In such cases, the plaintiff must pay a bond </p><p>to the court, half of which is forfeited if the dispute is </p><p>resolved before the beginning of court proceedings.  Also, </p><p>the court proceedings must begin within six months of the </p><p>date of the dispute.  Many international investors express </p><p>concerns about the ability of the court system to </p><p>impartially and promptly render a decision that accurately </p><p>reflects the facts and properly interprets the relevant </p><p>Vietnamese law and/or international law and practice. </p><p>Thus, they prefer to have other options available to them. </p><p>According to Vietnamese press accounts, many court </p><p>judgments on business issues are ignored because the </p><p>affected party can use "influence" to forestall the </p><p>application of the judgment. </p><p> </p><p>30.  Outside of the court system, economic arbitration </p><p>centers operate in a number of provinces and cities. </p><p>However, it is not clear if these centers are legally </p><p>competent to settle disputes involving foreign parties. The </p><p>second type of arbitration institution in Vietnam is the </p><p>Vietnam International Arbitration Center (VIAC), which </p><p>operates in close coordination with the Vietnam Chamber of </p><p>Commerce and Industry (VCCI).  It has authority to settle </p><p>disputes arising from international economic transactions </p><p>including contracts on foreign trade and investment. </p><p>However, it is not clear if investors would be free to </p><p>choose foreign arbitrators.  Nor can international standard </p><p>arbitration rules, such as those of the International </p><p>Chamber of Commerce (ICC) or the United Nations Commission </p><p>on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), be used.  The </p><p>decisions of the VIAC are final and cannot be appealed to </p><p>any domestic court. The center does not yet have an </p><p>established track record for competence or impartiality, </p><p>and questions have been raised about the enforceability of </p><p>its awards. The Government is scheduled to submit an </p><p>Ordinance on Commercial Arbitration to the National </p><p>Assembly in 2002, which may improve the domestic commercial </p><p>arbitration system.  But for now, most foreign parties </p><p>choose to stipulate "third party" arbitration in their </p><p>contracts with Vietnamese parties and the government. </p><p> </p><p>31.  Foreign and domestic arbitral awards are technically </p><p>legally enforceable in Vietnam.  Vietnam acceded to the New </p><p>York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of </p><p>Foreign Arbitral Awards in 1995, meaning that foreign </p><p>arbitral awards rendered by a recognized international </p><p>arbitration institution must be respected by Vietnamese </p><p>courts without a review of the case\'s merit.  In practice, </p><p>however, the U.S. Embassy is aware of contradicting </p><p>judgments and decisions by different Vietnamese courts with </p><p>regards to a foreign arbitral award for a case between a </p><p>subsidiary of a U.S. firm and an Australian-Vietnamese </p><p>joint venture.  The foreign arbitral award was recognized </p><p>by a municipal Economic Court, but was subsequently </p><p>reversed by the Supreme Court (the highest judicial level) </p><p>upon appeal.  The Supreme Court rearbitrated the case in </p><p>Vietnam (contrary to the agreed upon procedures in the </p><p>contract) and ruled that as a construction contract did not </p><p>fit the narrow definition of commercial contract found in </p><p>the Commercial Code, a foreign arbitral award relating to </p><p>it could not be enforced in Vietnam. The results of this </p><p>case indicated that the enforceability of a foreign </p><p>arbitral award in Vietnam currently remains questionable. </p><p>In February 2003, the Government tried to address some of </p><p>the issues addressed by this case through an Ordinance on </p><p>Commercial Arbitration.  The ordinance defines "commercial </p><p>activities" more broadly to include, inter alia, leasing, </p><p>construction, consultancy, licensing, investment, </p><p>financing, banking, insurance, exploration, mining </p><p>activities and transportation.  But, it is not clear </p><p>whether this change will positively affect the way courts </p><p>address these issues. </p><p>32.   Under the investment chapter of the BTA, Vietnam </p><p>gives U.S. investors the right to choose a variety of third </p><p>party dispute settlement mechanisms in the event of an </p><p>investment dispute with the GVN.  Vietnam has not yet </p><p>acceded to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment </p><p>Disputes between States and Nationals of other States </p><p>(ICSID), but has asked the U.S. to provide advice in this </p><p>area as part of the U.S. technical assistance program </p><p>designed to assist Vietnam to fully implement the BTA. </p><p> </p><p>33.  For the time being, exit strategies for foreign </p><p>investors remain limited and problematic.  GVN permission </p><p>is required to liquidate an investment or business venture </p><p>and is sometimes hard to get.  At present, the bankruptcy </p><p>process can be quite complicated and often takes more than </p><p>a year to complete.  The Bankruptcy Law applies to all </p><p>domestic and foreign-invested companies except national </p><p>defense and public service organizations, but since its </p><p>enactment only a small number of firms have been put into </p><p>bankruptcy proceedings and declared bankrupt. In addition, </p><p>if the partner is a state-owned enterprise, it remains </p><p>unclear who is ultimately assumes the debts of the SOEs. </p><p>To date, the Government asserts that it is not financially </p><p>responsible for SOE debts unless it has pledged a sovereign </p><p>guarantee. </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>A.5. Performance Requirements/Incentives </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>34.   While Vietnam is not yet a member of the World Trade </p><p>Organization (WTO), under the BTA Vietnam is obligated to </p><p>gradually discontinue application of any trade-related </p><p>investment measures (TRIMS) or performance requirements </p><p>inconsistent with the WTO TRIMS agreement.  Vietnam </p><p>currently does impose a number of performance requirements </p><p>with respect to the establishment of an investment and/or </p><p>the receipt of a benefit or incentive.  The BTA stipulates </p><p>Vietnam must phase out several TRIMS-inconsistent local </p><p>content requirements within five years or less of the BTA\'s </p><p>entry-into-force.  Vietnam has eliminated trade-balancing </p><p>requirements previously imposed through restrictions on the </p><p>importation of goods used for production by foreign </p><p>investors.  In the same vein, it has removed foreign </p><p>exchange balancing requirements.  Under the BTA, Vietnam is </p><p>also obligated to refrain from imposing requirements to </p><p>transfer technology as a condition for the establishment, </p><p>expansion, acquisition, management, conduct or operation of </p><p>an investment. </p><p> </p><p>35. The GVN employs an extensive range of incentives in an </p><p>attempt to attract foreign investment into certain priority </p><p>sectors or geographical regions.  The LFI and subsequent </p><p>decrees authorize MPI to \'encourage investment in </p><p>mountainous and remote areas\' of the country and in regions </p><p>with \'difficult economic and social conditions\'.  MPI also </p><p>encourages investment in export production, agricultural </p><p>and forestry production, high technology, ecology, research </p><p>and development, labor-intensive processing of raw </p><p>materials, and large industrial and/or infrastructure </p><p>projects.  The law also favors, to a lesser degree, </p><p>investments in metallurgy, basic chemicals, petrochemicals, </p><p>fertilizer manufacture, manufacturing (especially </p><p>electronic components and car and motorbike parts), and </p><p>planting industrial crops.  Under Circulars 1817 and 1818 </p><p>(1999), the Ministry of Science, Technology, and </p><p>Environment (MOSTE) also encourages projects in the areas </p><p>of treatment of environmental pollution and waste, </p><p>production of new or rare and precious materials, </p><p>application of new biological technology, application of </p><p>new technology for manufacturing communication and </p><p>telecommunication equipment, and electronic and informatics </p><p>technology.  More recently, the GVN opened the healthcare </p><p>and education sectors more widely to foreign investment and </p><p>began providing a variety of incentives for such </p><p>investment.   Although the GVN encourages investment in the </p><p>provinces, enforcement of investor protections and BTA </p><p>rights with Provincial Authorities has proven difficult at </p><p>best.  Investors should use due diligence when working at </p><p>the Provincial or local levels. </p><p> </p><p>36.  Under the LFI, the standard rate of corporate income </p><p>tax rate is 25%, with preferential rates for designated </p><p>project categories.  However, various tax reforms are </p><p>proposed for 2003, including applying the same corporate </p><p>income tax rate (28%) and tax incentives to both domestic </p><p>and foreign-invested enterprises. </p><p> </p><p>37.  Depending on the sector, FIEs and foreign parties to a </p><p>BCC may be exempted from profits tax for a maximum period </p><p>of two years commencing from the first profit-making year </p><p>and may be allowed a 50 percent reduction of profits tax </p><p>for a maximum period of two consecutive years.  Certain </p><p>\'encouraged\' projects may be exempted from profit tax for </p><p>up to four years from their first profitable year and may </p><p>be allowed a 50 percent reduction of profits tax for a </p><p>further four years.  Where the investment is \'especially </p><p>encouraged,\' the maximum period of tax exemption shall be </p><p>eight years.  Such exemptions are generally written into a </p><p>company\'s investment license. </p><p> </p><p>38. The law on export and import duties specifies the rates </p><p>which FIEs and parties to BCC\'s must pay on exports and </p><p>imports.  Equipment, machinery, specialized means of </p><p>transportation, components and spare parts for machinery </p><p>and equipment, raw materials and inputs for manufacturing, </p><p>and construction materials that cannot be produced </p><p>domestically, which are imported to Vietnam to form fixed </p><p>assets of an FIE or a BCC are exempted from import duties. </p><p>Other exemptions or reductions of import and export duties </p><p>can be stipulated by the GVN for \'encouraged\' projects and </p><p>are also generally contained in an enterprise\'s investment </p><p>license </p><p> </p><p>39. Other special incentives are available to foreign </p><p>investors in build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects and </p><p>projects located in export processing zones (EPZ) and </p><p>industrial zone (IZ).  BOTs may be joint ventures or 100% </p><p>foreign-owned.  They are exempt from land tax and from </p><p>payment of duties on goods imported to implement the </p><p>contracts.  They enjoy a lower profits tax rate (10%), a </p><p>five percent withholding tax rate (the lowest normal rate), </p><p>an eight-year tax holiday starting from the first </p><p>profitable year, and a government guarantee for conversion </p><p>of revenue from local to foreign currency.  The term of a </p><p>BOT can extend to 50 years, after which project ownership </p><p>reverts to the government. </p><p> </p><p>40.  Projects in EPZs are entitled to profit tax rates of </p><p>10-12% for the duration of the investments.  EPZs were the </p><p>first production zones developed in Vietnam, but interest </p><p>in them has been less than anticipated due to inadequate </p><p>infrastructure and a requirement that these firms export </p><p>100% of their product.  Ho Chi Minh City\'s Tan Thuan Zone </p><p>is Vietnam\'s largest EPZ, while others are planned or in </p><p>operation in Danang, Can Tho, Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh City. </p><p>Export-producing firms wishing to operate in an EPZ apply </p><p>for licenses and pay taxes directly to the EPZ management </p><p>boards, which streamlines the process.  Imports of </p><p>machinery and raw materials enter the zones duty-free, and </p><p>EPZ firms sometimes also benefit from lower rents, fewer </p><p>regulations, and a variety of tax incentives. </p><p> </p><p>41.  IZs are open to companies engaged in construction, </p><p>manufacturing, processing or assembly of industrial </p><p>products, and service to support industrial production. </p><p>Companies submit license applications and pay taxes </p><p>directly to the IZ management boards.  IZ firms also are </p><p>eligible for certain tax benefits, including a 10% profit </p><p>tax for the duration of the investment.  Companies that </p><p>reinvest profits may be eligible for refund of profit </p><p>taxes.  Foreign-invested automobile manufacturing projects </p><p>are subject to local content requirements in their </p><p>investment licenses. </p><p> </p><p>42.  Vietnam has also instituted a number of incentives </p><p>designed to attract investment from foreign investors of </p><p>Vietnamese origin.  They are allowed to choose to operate </p><p>under domestic, as opposed to foreign, business licenses, </p><p>although they may choose to operate as a foreign business </p><p>where doing so would be advantageous to them.   The land </p><p>law has also been amended to permit limited categories of </p><p>these investors to buy land use rights to build homes, </p><p>which other foreigners are not permitted to do.  However, </p><p>the GVN often does not recognize the adopted nationality of </p><p>many Vietnamese origin persons unless they have formally </p><p>renounced their Vietnamese citizenship and may consider </p><p>them to be Vietnamese nationals.  U.S. investors of </p><p>Vietnamese origin should consult the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi </p><p>or the U.S Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City for more </p><p>information. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>A.6. Right to Private Ownership and Establishment </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>43.  Until the late-1980\'s, the Vietnamese economy was </p><p>organized according to principles of socialist central </p><p>planning.  Since then, the government has moved to develop </p><p>a market-oriented economy and has formally recognized the </p><p>existence of the private sector.  In recent years, the </p><p>private sector, foreign and domestic and, to a lesser </p><p>extent, a small collective sector have begun to play </p><p>greater roles in the economy, although current policy </p><p>dictates that the state sector will continue to "play a </p><p>leading role" in the economy. </p><p> </p><p>44.  SOEs continue to dominate the industrial economy of </p><p>Vietnam.  A large majority of these SOEs suffer from weak </p><p>finances, high debt, obsolete plant and equipment, poor </p><p>management, poorly trained staff, low labor productivity, </p><p>and low product quality.   According to the World Bank, </p><p>Vietnam has approximately 5,600 SOEs, down from around </p><p>12,000 in the early 1990\'s.  At least 60 percent of the </p><p>remaining SOEs are incurring losses, and some estimates </p><p>indicate this number may even be higher. </p><p> </p><p>45.  As part of its 2001 economic reform agreement with the </p><p>World Bank and the IMF, the GVN has committed to equitize </p><p>roughly one-third of the current SOEs over three years and </p><p>ensure that those remaining become competitive.  However, </p><p>actual implementation of the reform program has been slower </p><p>than planned.  In addition, many international observers </p><p>expressed disappointment that the government did not agree </p><p>to completely dismantle its SOE sector over time. </p><p>Especially disconcerting to these observers is the Socio- </p><p>economic strategy for 2001-2010 which reconfirms the </p><p>"leading role" of the state enterprise sector and instructs </p><p>the government to strengthen SOE operations in broad range </p><p>of sectors which hold considerable interest for the </p><p>international investor, including telecommunications, </p><p>banking, insurance, petroleum and more. </p><p> </p><p>46.   A vibrant private sector is emerging in Vietnam. </p><p>Dozens of large-scale Vietnamese private enterprises and </p><p>tens of thousands small and medium sized firms now exist. </p><p>The single most crucial GVN action in supporting of the </p><p>development of the domestic private sector was the </p><p>enactment, in January 2000, of the Enterprise Law, which </p><p>provided, for the first time, simplified domestic business </p><p>registration rather than discretionary government approval </p><p>and licensing.  At the end of 1999, official statistics </p><p>counted 28,000 companies in the formal domestic private </p><p>sector.  Since, then almost 55,000 enterprises have been </p><p>registered, the large majority of which are new </p><p>enterprises.  The rest were previously existing firms that </p><p>moved from the informal to the formal sector.   Also, as </p><p>part of implementation of the new law, the GVN has moved to </p><p>abolish nearly 200 "unnecessary" permits required by </p><p>various ministries and localities for operation of a </p><p>business.  Unfortunately, these agencies keep adding to the </p><p>list of these "baby permits" in an effort to re-establish </p><p>control over issues they previously influenced via the </p><p>licensing system.   Domestic private enterprises have </p><p>created substantial new employment in Vietnam, while </p><p>employment in the state sector has been stagnant or </p><p>declining. </p><p> </p><p>47.   Private firms, however, continue to be severely </p><p>disadvantaged relative to SOEs in terms of access to credit </p><p>and land, and in legal and regulatory treatment.  Private </p><p>firms face restrictions in using land use rights for joint </p><p>ventures with foreign investors.  SOEs also receive most of </p><p>the lending from state-owned banks, which dominate the </p><p>banking sector.  In general, despite these restrictions, </p><p>the relatively larger private firms that are emerging in </p><p>Vietnam operate with better management and greater </p><p>efficiency than the SOEs.   Moreover, high-ranking </p><p>government officials have stated the GVN\'s intention to put </p><p>foreign and domestic investment on more or less even </p><p>footing with SOEs with respect to access to credit, legal </p><p>and regulatory treatment, pricing, and fees.  However, SOEs </p><p>are likely to retain better access to land and will </p><p>continue to be expected to "dominate" in key sectors as </p><p>identified by the political leadership. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>A.7. Protection of Property Rights </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>48.  The Vietnamese legal system is in a state of </p><p>transition to support a more market-oriented economy and </p><p>undergoes frequent and at times significant change.  The </p><p>rudiments of a legal system that protects and facilitates </p><p>property rights have been established.  But much more work </p><p>needs to develop the laws and enforcement mechanisms needed </p><p>to adequately protect property rights in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>49.  All land in Vietnam belongs to "the people", </p><p>administered or managed by the State.  Private land use </p><p>rights (LURs) were established for the first time in 1988. </p><p>A LUR is a State-granted right to use land for a specific </p><p>purpose.  The 1992 constitution granted stronger land </p><p>rights to individuals, including rights over commercial and </p><p>personal property.  LURs may be granted for up to 50 years, </p><p>depending on the specific use of the land.  Individual </p><p>holders of LURs can sell them if they move to a new </p><p>location, change jobs, or are unable to work.  In 1998 </p><p>several changes to the land law were enacted, primarily to </p><p>distinguish between corporate leaseholders, who can use </p><p>their land for domestic or foreign joint ventures, and </p><p>individual leaseholders who are not permitted to enter </p><p>joint ventures with foreign entities.  In the 1993 land </p><p>law, the National Assembly broadened LURs to include rights </p><p>to exchange, transfer, rent, inherit, and mortgage land. </p><p>Additional amendments to the land law in 2001 and </p><p>subsequent implementing regulations decentralized authority </p><p>for leasing land to businesses and permitted local </p><p>officials to lease land to foreign organizations, </p><p>individuals and overseas Vietnamese.  Still, foreign </p><p>investors can currently only lease land from the Government </p><p>or in industrial parks.  These limitations may soon be </p><p>lifted.  The Government issued Resolution Number 2 in </p><p>January 2003, proposing allowing domestic private companies </p><p>with long-term land use rights to lease their land to </p><p>foreign investors, provided that the lease is not longer </p><p>than the rights held by the leaser.  The Ministry of </p><p>Natural Resources and Environment has been tasked with </p><p>formulating regulations to be issued in the second quarter </p><p>of 2003. </p><p> </p><p>50.  Vietnamese LUR-holders have the right to mortgage </p><p>them, but Vietnamese banks generally value land at a </p><p>maximum of 70 percent of the total rent already paid on the </p><p>property, not the property\'s appraised value.  As </p><p>organizations only were obliged to begin paying rent in </p><p>February 1995, the values of mortgages on land are not </p><p>large, which limits their usefulness for property-based </p><p>project finance.  The amended LFI permits foreign banks </p><p>branches to accept mortgages of land use rights.  But to </p><p>date, widespread use of collateralized bank loan actions </p><p>have been hampered by a lack of central registration for </p><p>mortgaged assets.  Foreign banks also want to see an </p><p>amendment to the land law to permit them to take possession </p><p>of the land after a foreclosure, and amendments to banking </p><p>regulations.  In March 2002, a good first step was made </p><p>when the New National Register for Secured Transactions </p><p>opened for business in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.   But </p><p>the registry does not have jurisdiction over land-use </p><p>rights or buildings, assets that remain under the control </p><p>of local authorities and the enforceability of collateral </p><p>in the form of LUR and property remains uncertain. </p><p>51.  Vietnam is a member of the World Intellectual Property </p><p>Organization (WIPO) and is a signatory to the Paris </p><p>Convention for Industrial Property.  It has acceded to the </p><p>Patent Cooperation Treaty and the Madrid Agreement.  While </p><p>not yet a party to the Berne Convention, Vietnam agreed </p><p>under the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Copy Right agreement to </p><p>provide U.S. copyrights protection on national treatment </p><p>basis in accordance with the terms of that convention. </p><p>Under the terms of the BTA, Vietnam is obligated, within </p><p>two years, to make its system for protecting intellectual </p><p>property rights (IPR), including enforcement, consistent </p><p>with the WTO TRIPS agreement.  Considerable progress had </p><p>been made over the past several years, with new regulations </p><p>expanding legal protection to areas previously not covered, </p><p>such as business secrets and new plant varieties, for </p><p>example, protection of which were the subject of new </p><p>regulations issued within the past 12 months. </p><p> </p><p>52.  However, in June 2003,  the GVN announced that it </p><p>planned to change the way intellectual property rights are </p><p>handled in Vietnam and as of this writing, the situation is </p><p>in flux.  Previously trademark registration in Vietnam was </p><p>relatively straightforward.  However, the GVN has proposed </p><p>to remove responsibility for trademarks from the National </p><p>Office of Industrial Property (Patents and Trademarks) and </p><p>move just the registration function to the Ministry of </p><p>Trade, although not the research or adjudication function. </p><p>If the GVN implements the changes as planned, Vietnam may </p><p>have a much more incoherent system of IPR protection, in </p><p>particular,  trademark protection will be more difficult </p><p>and foreign trademark holders, as well as domestic </p><p>trademark holders, will be more vulnerable to infringement. </p><p>IPR infringement continues to be widespread and enforcement </p><p>of administrative orders and court decisions finding IPR </p><p>infringement remains problematic.  Vietnam\'s laws offer </p><p>some protection for foreign patent holders, but there are </p><p>infringements.  Potential investors should contact the U.S. </p><p>Embassy in Hanoi or the Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh </p><p>City for the latest information regarding the ongoing </p><p>changes  to IPR protection in Vietnam.  Obtaining </p><p>expeditious adjudication and administrative enforcement of </p><p>patent and trademark violations remains difficult and may </p><p>get worse with the proposed changes.   Vietnam\'s copyright </p><p>office is under the control and supervision of the Ministry </p><p>of Culture and Information.  Significant progress has been </p><p>made putting in place the laws protect copyrights including </p><p>those belonging to foreigners but  enforcement is almost </p><p>non-existent. </p><p> </p><p>53.  Enforcement of IPR remains weak and violations of IPR </p><p>are rampant and may get worse under the proposed changes. </p><p>While Vietnam recently has conducted considerable </p><p>administrative and law enforcement actions against IPR </p><p>violations, IPR enforcement remains the exception rather </p><p>than the rule.  For some types of products, such as PC </p><p>software, music and video CDs, VCDs and DVDs, as well as </p><p>brand trademark violations, such as logos on t-shirts and </p><p>other consumer items, IPR enforcement is virtually non- </p><p>existent.  Industries estimates of piracy rates for </p><p>software, music and video, run as high as 99 percent. </p><p>Local police authorities often are slow to act on </p><p>administrative orders finding infringement and court </p><p>decisions.  Violators sometimes negotiate with plaintiffs, </p><p>demanding payoffs to stop producing pirated material. </p><p>However, there is the beginning of some progress with </p><p>increased awareness of the need for effective IPR </p><p>enforcement to foster investment, both foreign and </p><p>domestic, in sectors such as software development and the </p><p>arts.  In addition, Vietnamese authorities are becoming </p><p>increasingly concerned that the proliferation of pirated </p><p>products also undermines their ability to prevent the </p><p>distribution of pornography and other illegal content. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>A8. Transparency of the Regulatory System </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>54.  As Vietnam undergoes a transition to a more market- </p><p>oriented economy, the legal system is changed frequently, </p><p>and at times, significantly.  Vietnamese officials have </p><p>limited experience drafting legislation, and new laws and </p><p>regulations sometimes are contradictory or unclear.  Not </p><p>all officials, especially those at the provincial and local </p><p>levels, are fully up-to-date on all the new laws and </p><p>regulations which impact on their work.  Nor are all laws </p><p>and regulations readily available to business and the </p><p>public.  Different officials, sometimes within the same </p><p>agency, may interpret laws differently.  There is a </p><p>shortage of practicing lawyers, law-graduate judges, and </p><p>law professors.  Substantial foreign assistance is being </p><p>devoted to assist Vietnam to establish a legal structure </p><p>compatible with international standards. </p><p>55.  Although the Vietnamese government has begun to </p><p>streamline and rationalize the investment licensing process </p><p>over the past year, MPI and other national, provincial, and </p><p>local government agencies retain a great deal of </p><p>discretionary authority.  U.S. and other investors </p><p>frequently encounter the need for further negotiation and </p><p>administrative processes after the licensing process has </p><p>been completed.  A general lack of transparency in law and </p><p>regulation make it difficult not only to exercise rights, </p><p>but to even be aware of what rules apply to an investment. </p><p>In recent years, Vietnam has improved its process for </p><p>making and publicizing laws, but beyond major national laws </p><p>and regulations, much rule-making affecting foreign </p><p>investors still occurs at the ministerial, sub-ministerial </p><p>and local levels, without any regular process for public </p><p>notification and little possibility for advance warning of </p><p>changes in rules or for public input during the rule-making </p><p>process. </p><p> </p><p>56.   Under the BTA, Vietnam is obligated to promptly </p><p>publish all existing and future laws, regulations and </p><p>administrative procedures which might affect any matter </p><p>covered under the agreement including investment and trade </p><p>in goods and services.  The BTA further commits Vietnam to </p><p>enforce only laws, regulations or administrative practices </p><p>that have been so published and to publicize such laws in </p><p>sufficient advance of their effectiveness to ensure U.S. </p><p>investors have adequate time to adjust their operations </p><p>accordingly. Vietnam has committed to provide a process by </p><p>which the U.S. Government and U.S. nationals have the </p><p>ability to provide their views to the GVN on any such laws, </p><p>regulations or administrative practices while they are </p><p>still being formulated.  Finally, U.S. nationals have the </p><p>right to appeal administrative action relating to matters </p><p>relating to the agreement.  In December 2002, the National </p><p>Assembly passed the "Law on Legal Normative Documents". </p><p>Although this Law meets some of its BTA commitments, the </p><p>GVN is not yet in full compliance with these obligations, </p><p>in particular regarding prior notice and consultation on </p><p>proposed regulatory and legal changes... </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>A.9. Efficient Capital Markets/Portfolio Investment </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>57.  Vietnam\' financial system is in the early stages of </p><p>reform and is not yet an efficient allocator of financial </p><p>resources.  At least 50% of personal savings are held as </p><p>cash, gold, or other assets outside the banking system. </p><p>However, as part of its World Bank/IMF program, the GVN </p><p>adopted a comprehensive banking reform program that relies </p><p>on market-based action which is intended to ensure the </p><p>stability of the banking system, and in the medium-to-long </p><p>term, promote better mobilization of domestic resources by </p><p>improving allocation of those resources to commercially </p><p>viable activities, and expand banking services throughout </p><p>Vietnam.  Raising capital for development is one of </p><p>Vietnam\'s main economic priorities. </p><p> </p><p>58.  Foreign investors generally meet their foreign </p><p>currency credit needs offshore or with foreign bank </p><p>branches, although availability of foreign exchanges to </p><p>convert dong assets to cover dollar liabilities can be, at </p><p>times, uncertain.  Foreign banks are severely limited in </p><p>their right to take dong deposits and frequently encounter </p><p>difficulties meeting customer\'s dong cash and credit needs. </p><p>However, under the BTA, U.S. banks now enjoy more a more </p><p>liberal policy on dong deposits.   The State Bank and the </p><p>Ministry of Finance have conducted sales of state bonds </p><p>denominated in local currency, but Vietnam only has an </p><p>informal secondary market for such instruments. </p><p> </p><p>59. The banking industry in Vietnam is characterized by its </p><p>small size in terms of deposits and loans and by the </p><p>relatively large number of banks, both foreign and </p><p>domestic.  However, the four state-owned banks -- the </p><p>Vietnam Bank of Foreign Trade (Vietcombank), the Vietnam </p><p>Industrial and Commercial Bank (Incombank), the Bank for </p><p>Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Vietnam </p><p>Investment Bank -- still dominate domestic banking </p><p>activity, providing an estimated 70 percent of all lending. </p><p>Most local banks are under-capitalized, particularly when </p><p>non-performing loans are taken into account.  Most are also </p><p>weakened by state-directed lending under non-commercial </p><p>criteria.  Furthermore, local banks, including the four </p><p>state-owned banks, hold a large number of non-performing </p><p>loans, mainly to SOEs.    IMF staff estimate that non- </p><p>performing loans are roughly 30% of outstanding loans. </p><p> </p><p>60.  In 1997, the government introduced a new accounting </p><p>standard, the \'Vietnamese accounting system.\'  The Ministry </p><p>of Finance continues to refine and amend this standard to </p><p>bring it into consistency with international accounting </p><p>standards.   After several years of grace period, foreign </p><p>banks and companies are now required to comply fully with </p><p>its parameters.  A number of major international accounting </p><p>firms have opened offices in Vietnam and, unlike foreign </p><p>law firms (which are subjected to restrictions including </p><p>advising clients on Vietnamese law and hiring Vietnamese </p><p>lawyers), can provide advice on accounting and business </p><p>issues directly to foreign clients in Vietnam. </p><p>Nonetheless, a continued lack of financial transparency and </p><p>compliance with internationally accepted standards among </p><p>Vietnamese firms continues to pose problems for the </p><p>government\'s plan to expand stock and securities markets to </p><p>raise capital internally. </p><p> </p><p>61.  Despite these challenges and after years of discussion </p><p>and planning, Vietnam opened a stock market in July 2000. </p><p>A total of 21 joint stock companies, primarily former SOE\'s </p><p>now under a restructuring/equitization program, have listed </p><p>on the exchange.  Several more are expected to do so soon, </p><p>and before the end of the year, experts anticipate that </p><p>there will be 20-25 listed companies. Under current market </p><p>regulations, share prices of a listed company cannot </p><p>increase or decrease by more than five percent per trading </p><p>session.   To date, with its small trading volume, and </p><p>restrictive rules on both listing and investor </p><p>participation, the nascent market has yet to become a real </p><p>source for financing or intermediation. </p><p> </p><p>62.  Foreign organizations and individuals can only hold a </p><p>maximum of 30% of total shares issued by a listed company, </p><p>of which a single foreign organization may hold a maximum </p><p>of seven percent and a single foreign individual may hold a </p><p>maximum of three percent.  MPI maintains a list of sectors </p><p>and business lines in which foreigners may purchase shares </p><p>in Vietnamese private enterprises in an effort to encourage </p><p>private domestic enterprises to list and foreign investors </p><p>to buy shares.   In April 2002, the latest version of this </p><p>list was issued.  It includes selected commercial </p><p>activities in five broad areas: agriculture, forestry and </p><p>aquaculture; industry and processing; hotels and </p><p>restaurants; transport, warehousing and communications; and </p><p>science, technology, health care and education. </p><p> </p><p>63.  In March 2003, the Government issued Decision 36/QD- </p><p>BKH revising the regulations on foreign shareholdings in </p><p>Vietnamese companies, which are not listed on the Vietnam </p><p>stock market.  The new Decision governs purchase of shares </p><p>and capital contribution by the following foreign </p><p>investors: </p><p> </p><p>?Foreign economic and financial organizations </p><p>established pursuant to foreign law and conducting </p><p>business overseas or in Vietnam; </p><p>?Non-resident foreigners in Vietnam; </p><p>?Foreigners who reside, earn their living and live </p><p>long-term in Vietnam; </p><p>?Overseas Vietnamese </p><p> </p><p>An important reform is that Prime Minister\'s approval is no </p><p>longer required for the sale of shares to foreign </p><p>investors.  However the maximum level of capital </p><p>contribution and purchase of shares by any one or more </p><p>foreign investor in Vietnamese companies is still capped at </p><p>30% of the charter capital of the Vietnamese companies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>64.  A handful of regional and Vietnam-specific investment </p><p>funds were set up to invest in Vietnam following the </p><p>lifting of the U.S. trade embargo in 1994, but their </p><p>results have mostly been poor.  After promising beginnings </p><p>in 1995, by 1998 shares in some of the funds were trading </p><p>at an average discount of nearly 50 percent, and some were </p><p>ere </p><p>forced significantly to write down the value of their </p><p>portfolios, while most failed to fully invest the funds </p><p>raised for Vietnam due to a dearth of attractive </p><p>opportunities.  The continuing lack of a developed stock </p><p>market means funds do not have access to portfolio </p><p>investment. </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>A.10. Political Violence </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>65. Vietnam is undertaking an ambitious course of </p><p>transition both domestically and internationally, but </p><p>remains essentially stable under the continued leadership </p><p>of the CPV.  As the country proceeds with its transition </p><p>from a centrally-directed economy to a more genuinely </p><p>market-based economy, a process which began in the late </p><p>1980\'s, the GVN and the CPV have, at the same time, reduced </p><p>official interference in private lives of citizens and have </p><p>permitted a broad expansion of personal liberties.  But the </p><p>GVN remains a one-Party state that brooks no overt </p><p>criticism of the GVN or CPV and continues to restrict </p><p>freedoms of religion, speech, assembly, and press, while </p><p>denying true choice of political system or leaders.  There </p><p>are no signs of active opposition to the GVN or CPV, </p><p>however, and most Vietnamese appear satisfied with the </p><p>economic and social improvements of the last 16 years. </p><p>There have nonetheless been isolated protests, such as </p><p>large demonstrations by ethnic minorities in the Central </p><p>Highlands in 2001 and smaller gatherings at the semi-annual </p><p>meetings of the National Assembly by a variety of </p><p>disaffected individuals. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>A.11. Corruption </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>66.   U.S. and other foreign firms as well as domestic </p><p>private sector firms,  have identified corruption in </p><p>Vietnam in all phases of business operations as an obstacle </p><p>to their business activities.  Vietnam scored a 2.4 out of </p><p>a possible high score of 10 points on Transparency </p><p>International\'s Corruption Perception Index behind </p><p>neighbors Malaysia and Thailand but above Indonesia.  In </p><p>large part due to a lack of transparency, accountability, </p><p>and media freedom, widespread official corruption and </p><p>inefficient bureaucracy remain serious problems that even </p><p>the CPV and GVN admit they must address squarely and soon. </p><p>Competition among government agencies for control over </p><p>business and investments has created a confusion of </p><p>overlapping jurisdictions and bureaucratic procedures and </p><p>approvals which in turn create opportunities for </p><p>corruption.  Low pay for government officials and woefully </p><p>inadequate systems for holding officials accountable for </p><p>their actions compound the problems.  Implementation the </p><p>GVN\'s Public Administration Reform, developed in with the </p><p>assistance of the World Bank, and the country\'s obligations </p><p>under the transparency provisions of the BTA promise some </p><p>improvement in the situation.  But it appears unlikely that </p><p>they will be successful in this effort to eliminate </p><p>corruption the near term. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>B. Bilateral Investment Agreements </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>67.  Vietnam has 45 bilateral investment agreements with </p><p>the following countries and territories: Algeria, </p><p>Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium </p><p>and Luxembourg, Bulgaria, Burma, Chile, China, Cuba, Czech </p><p>Republic, Cambodia, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, </p><p>Germany, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Italy, Laos, </p><p>Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mongolia, Netherlands, North </p><p>Korea, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, </p><p>South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tajikistan, </p><p>Thailand, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Uzbekistan. Vietnam </p><p>has not concluded a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with </p><p>the U.S., but the BTA contains an investment chapter which </p><p>closely resembles U.S. BITs and contains most of the </p><p>principal obligations common to such agreements Vietnam </p><p>also does not have bilateral taxation treaty with the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>C. OPIC and other investment insurance programs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>68.  According to U.S. law, the Overseas Private Investment </p><p>Corporation (OPIC) may not operate in Vietnam until the </p><p>President determines the country is in compliance with the </p><p>emigration standards of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the </p><p>1974 Trade Act, or waives compliance as being in the </p><p>national interest, and until OPIC certifies that Vietnam is </p><p>making adequate progress toward protection of workers\' </p><p>rights.  In March 1998, the President executed a Jackson- </p><p>Vanik waiver and OPIC and Vietnam signed a bilateral </p><p>agreement to enable OPIC to begin operations in Vietnam. </p><p>The waiver for Vietnam, and therefore continued </p><p>availability of OPIC services to U.S. business in Vietnam, </p><p>is subject to annual renewal and has been renewed each year </p><p>since the waiver was first issued.  As of May 2003, OPIC </p><p>had signed one active insurance contract in Vietnam.  OPIC </p><p>is reviewing several applications to support other </p><p>potential projects. </p><p> </p><p>69.  In the event OPIC should pay an inconvertibility claim </p><p>in the future, the U.S.  Embassy estimates its total annual </p><p>local currency disbursements to be approximately 51 </p><p>trillion Vietnamese dong (VND), or about US$ 3.3 million </p><p>(June 2003). The exchange rate on June 20, 2002 stood at </p><p>15,480 VND/USD.  The value of the Vietnamese dong </p><p>depreciated 1.4 percent over the past year, and is expected </p><p>to gradually depreciate at approximately the same or slower </p><p>rate over the next year. </p><p> </p><p>70. Vietnam joined the Multilateral Investment Guarantee </p><p>Agency (MIGA) in 1995. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>D. Labor </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>71.  One of Vietnam\'s principal attractions for foreign </p><p>investors has been its large, relatively well-educated (the </p><p>GVN reports a literacy rate of over 90%), and inexpensive </p><p>labor force.  Now estimated at nearly 40 million, the labor </p><p>pool continues to increase by up to 1.5 million workers </p><p>annually due to the post-war population explosion. </p><p> </p><p>72.  Despite its attractions, labor in Vietnam poses some </p><p>problems for foreign investors.  There is a shortage of </p><p>managerial talent and skilled workers, resulting in higher </p><p>salaries for those employees.  Another factor raising the </p><p>cost of skilled and managerial workers is Vietnam\'s sharply </p><p>progressive personal income tax system, resulting in labor </p><p>costs for relatively high-paid local staff to be 2-3 times </p><p>higher than in other Asian countries.  One western manager </p><p>estimated that if he wanted one of his engineers to receive </p><p>a net salary of US$ 2,000 per month, the gross cost to his </p><p>firm for wages, taxes, and benefits would exceed US$ 9,000 </p><p>per month.  In some cases, he said, it would be less </p><p>expensive to employ an expatriate worker. </p><p> </p><p>73.  Under two 1999 directives, foreign organizations, </p><p>including FIEs, must recruit and hire staff through state- </p><p>owned employment bureaus, a requirement many investors find </p><p>onerous.  Under amendments to the Labor Lawthat entered </p><p>into force on January 1, 2003, FIEs  and foreign business </p><p>cooperation parties are now allowed to directly recruit </p><p>Vietnamese workers and foreigners.  However, the </p><p>requirement to use such employment service agencies will </p><p>continue to apply to branches and representative offices of </p><p>foreign companies, foreign non-governmental organizations </p><p>and foreign diplomatic missions. </p><p> </p><p>74.  Employers are required by law to establish labor </p><p>unions within six months of establishment of the company. </p><p>All labor unions must be members of the Vietnam General </p><p>Confederation of Labor, an organization under the Communist </p><p>Party-affiliated Fatherland Front.  There were, 79 labor </p><p>strikes in 2002, that latest statistics available.  Strikes </p><p>took place in SOEs, FIEs, and domestic private companies. </p><p>There were no known strikes at U.S.-invested companies. </p><p>Most of the strikes involved labor-management disputes over </p><p>health, safety, or other working conditions, work hours, or </p><p>late payment of wages, and were settled quickly. </p><p>75.  Vietnam is a member of the International Labor </p><p>Organization (ILO).  As of May 2003, it had ratified three </p><p>of the eight core labor conventions: 100 (Equal </p><p>Remuneration); 111 (Non-discrimination in Employment); and </p><p>182 (Worst Forms of Child Labor).  Vietnam ratified the </p><p>first two conventions on October 7, 1997 and the last on </p><p>December 19, 2000.  Vietnam has not ratified ILO </p><p>Conventions on freedom of association, protection of the </p><p>right to organize and collective bargaining.  However, </p><p>under the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights </p><p>to Work, all ILO members, including Vietnam, have pledged </p><p>to respect and promote all the core ILO labor standards, </p><p>including those on association, right to organize and </p><p>collective bargaining.  A number of technical assistance </p><p>projects in the field of labor sponsored by foreign donors </p><p>are underway in Vietnam, including work by the ILO and the </p><p>U.S. Department of Labor. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>E. Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>76.  Companies may choose to produce within an export </p><p>processing zone (EPZ) to take advantage of exemptions from </p><p>customs duties for equipment, raw materials, and </p><p>commodities imported into the zones, and for finished goods </p><p>and products exported from the zones, subject to specific </p><p>provisions regulating EPZs.  All of the production within </p><p>an EPZ must be exported.  Industrial zones (IZs) have been </p><p>developed to offer tax advantages for establishing </p><p>factories within the zones.  Companies can produce within </p><p>an IZ for the domestic market or for export.  The companies </p><p>pay no duties when importing raw materials, if the end </p><p>products are exported. </p><p> </p><p>77.  From the establishment of its first EPZ in 1991 through </p><p>March 2003, Vietnam established a total of 73 IZs and 3 </p><p>EPZs.   As of March 2003, there were 1,253foreign invested </p><p>enterprises licensed in the zones with a total registered </p><p>capital of US$ 10.85 billion, of which over US$ 4.5 billion </p><p>has been realized.Many foreign investors commented that it </p><p>is faster and more convenient to implement their projects </p><p>in the industrial zones than outside the zones as the land </p><p>is already planned and they do not have to be involved in </p><p>site clearance, compensation works and the construction of </p><p>necessary infrastructure, which are time consuming and </p><p>sometimes causes headaches. Foreign investment in the </p><p>industrial zones currently concentrates on light industry </p><p>projects, such as textile and garments, food processing. </p><p>The number of projects in heavy industry is still modest. </p><p> </p><p>78.  The operation of customs warehouses was approved in </p><p>1994.  There are bonded warehouses in Can Tho, Haiphong, Ho </p><p>Chi Minh City, Mong Cai, Quang Ninh, Binh Duong, Dong Nai </p><p>and Vung Tau.  Entities permitted to lease customs bonded </p><p>warehouses are foreign enterprises, individuals, and </p><p>overseas Vietnamese; Vietnamese import-export license </p><p>companies; and FIEs licensed to perform import-export </p><p>activities.  Most goods pending import and domestic goods </p><p>pending export can be deposited in bonded warehouses under </p><p>the supervision of the provincial customs office.  The </p><p>exceptions are goods prohibited from import or export, </p><p>Vietnamese-made goods with fraudulent trademarks or labels, </p><p>goods of unknown origin, and goods dangerous or harmful to </p><p>the public or environment. </p><p> </p><p>79.  The lease contract must be registered with the customs </p><p>bond unit at least 24 hours prior to the arrival of goods </p><p>at the port.  Documents required are a notarized copy of </p><p>authorization of the holder to receive the goods, a </p><p>notarized copy of the warehouse lease contract, the bill of </p><p>lading, a certificate of origin, a packing list, and </p><p>customs declaration forms.  Owners of the goods pay import </p><p>or export tax when the goods are removed from the bonded </p><p>warehouse. </p><p> </p><p>80.  Customs warehouse keepers can provide transportation </p><p>services and act as distributors for the goods deposited. </p><p>Additional services relating to customs declaration, </p><p>appraisal, insurance, reprocessing or packaging require the </p><p>approval of the provincial customs office.  In practice the </p><p>level of service needs improvement.  The time involved for </p><p>clearance and delivery can be lengthy and unpredictable. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>F.

According to the Ministry of Planning </p><p>and Investment, as of April 2003, Vietnamese businesses had </p><p>invested in 78 projects worth about US$ 187.3 million in </p><p>Russia, Singapore, Laos, Japan, Hong Kong, Cambodia, </p><p>Tajikistan, the Middle East, the United States, Uzbekistan, </p><p> the Middle East, the United States, Uzbekistan, </p><p>and Taiwan.  These investments were concentrated in the </p><p>following sectors:  transport, communications, </p><p>construction, food processing, oil and gas, hotel, </p><p>restaurant, and agriculture sectors.  Vietnamese businesses </p><p>have two investment projects worth US$260,000 in the United </p><p>States. One Vietnamese government-owned telecommunications </p><p>firm established an office in California.  There are no </p><p>Vietnamese government regulations on investment overseas. </p><p> </p><p>Note:  Statistics, including those on investment, are often </p><p>difficult to come by and are generally based on definitions </p><p>that differ from internationally-accepted standards.  Those </p><p>published in government statistical surveys are generally </p><p>incomplete and often inconsistent from publication to </p><p>publication and over time.  It is the policy of the </p><p>Ministry of Planning and Investment to respond only to </p><p>written requests for statistics or information on how they </p><p>are compiled and calculated, a process that is cumbersome </p><p>and very time consuming.  Additional statistical data is </p><p>often released in the local press but is difficult to </p><p>confirm and update year-to-year, because it is not also </p><p>provided in a database, which is readily available to the </p><p>public. </p><p> </p><p>3.End text of the 2003 Investment Climate Statement for </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
