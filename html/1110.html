<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 THE HAGUE 001679 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR S/WCI - SCHEFFER/WARRICK, S/SA - O\'BRIEN, </p><p>DRL - KOH/SPENCER, L - ANDREWS/MATHESON, L/EUR - LAHNE, </p><p>S/CT - SHEEHAN/BAIR, INR/WCAD - DONAHUE/MORIN, EUR/SCE - </p><p>COUNTRYMAN; </p><p>KIGALI FOR PAGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 FIVE YEARS AFTER CLOSURE ICTY </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, HR, SR, NL, ICTY, ICTR </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTY: JORDA PROPOSES "AD LITEM" JUDGES TO SPEED </p><p>TRIBUNAL\'S WORK </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY:  ALLEN S. WEINER, LEGAL COUNSELOR. </p><p>REASONS:  1.5(B), (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  SUMMARY:  JUDGE CLAUDE JORDA, PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA </p><p>(ICTY), VISITED AMBASSADOR ON TUESDAY, MAY 30, TO PREVIEW </p><p>PROPOSALS HE INTENDS TO MAKE BEFORE THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO </p><p>IMPROVE THE ICTY\'S CAPACITY TO TRY CASES MORE SWIFTLY.  THE </p><p>KEY PROPOSALS ARE FOR: (1) THE USE OF "AD LITEM" JUDGES TO </p><p>TRY CASES THAT ARE READY FOR TRIAL; AND (2) DELEGATION OF </p><p>CERTAIN PRE-TRIAL MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES TO SENIOR LEGAL </p><p>OFFICERS.  JORDA INTENDS FORMALLY TO MAKE HIS PROPOSALS </p><p>BEFORE THE SECURITY COUNCIL IN THE SECOND HALF OF JUNE. </p><p>EMBASSY BELIEVES JORDA\'S PROPOSALS ARE A SENSIBLE MEANS OF </p><p>ADDRESSING AN INCREASINGLY SEVERE BACKLOG PROBLEM, AND </p><p>RECOMMENDS THAT WASHINGTON SERIOUSLY CONSIDER SUPPORTING THE </p><p>PROPOSALS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ICTY PRESIDENT CLAUDE JORDA VISITED AMBASSADOR ON </p><p>TUESDAY, MAY 30, TO PREVIEW HIS REPORT ON THE OPERATION OF </p><p>THE TRIBUNAL.  AFTER BECOMING PRESIDENT IN NOVEMBER 1999, </p><p>JORDA INITIATED A REVIEW INTO THE TRIBUNAL\'S OPERATIONS AND </p><p>WAYS OF ENHANCING ITS EFFICIENCY, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, OF </p><p>ACCELERATING THE RATE AT WHICH TRIALS ARE CONDUCTED.  JORDA </p><p>SUBMITTED THE REPORT ON BEHALF OF THE ICTY\'S JUDGES TO U.N. </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL ANNAN ON MAY 12.  JORDA SAID THAT HE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>INTENDS FORMALLY TO MAKE HIS PROPOSALS BEFORE THE SECURITY </p><p>COUNCIL IN THE SECOND HALF OF JUNE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  IN HIS MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR, JORDA SAID THAT THE </p><p>JUDGES HAD REVIEWED THE TRIBUNAL\'S EXISTING METHODS OF WORK </p><p>AND HAD CONSIDERED CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE\'S ESTIMATES OF </p><p>THE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS SHE INTENDS TO PURSUE AND THE </p><p>ADDITIONAL INDICTMENTS SHE INTENDS TO SIGN.  JORDA NOTED THAT </p><p>DEL PONTE HAD INFORMED THE JUDGES AT A PLENARY SESSION THAT </p><p>THE OFFICE OF THE PROSECUTOR (OTP) INTENDS TO CONDUCT 36 NEW </p><p>INVESTIGATIONS THAT WILL CULMINATE IN 29 SEPARATE TRIALS </p><p>COVERING SOME 150 INDIVIDUALS.  THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE </p><p>TRIALS OF THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY IN CUSTODY AND THOSE WHO HAVE </p><p>BEEN INDICTED BUT REMAIN AT LARGE.  THE ICTY\'S CURRENT </p><p>STRUCTURE, WITH THREE TRIAL CHAMBERS, LIMITS THE TRIBUNAL\'S </p><p>ABILITY TO TRY CASES RAPIDLY.  BASED ON THE RATE OF ICTY </p><p>TRIALS TO DATE AND DEL PONTE\'S ESTIMATES, JORDA ESTIMATES </p><p>THAT THE ICTY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE TRIALS (EXCLUDING </p><p>APPEALS) OF ALL INDICTEES UNTIL LATE 2016. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  MOREOVER, JORDA INDICATED, THE PROBLEM OF LENGTHY </p><p>PRE-TRIAL DETENTION OF INDICTEES AWAITING THE START OF THEIR </p><p>TRIALS IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY SEVERE.  HE ESTIMATED THAT </p><p>WITHOUT CHANGES IN THE ICTY\'S MEANS OF OPERATING, THE TRIAL </p><p>OF THE MOST RECENT INDICTEE BROUGHT INTO CUSTODY, DRAGAN </p><p>NIKOLIC, WOULD NOT START UNTIL THE SECOND HALF OF 2002 AT THE </p><p>EARLIEST.  JORDA ALSO SAID THE ICTY HAD POSTPONED PRE-TRIAL </p><p>MANAGEMENT PROCEEDINGS IN THE CASE AGAINST MOMCILO KRAJISNIK </p><p>BECAUSE THERE IS NO AVAILABLE TRIAL CHAMBER; THE JUDGES DID </p><p>NOT WANT TO GET THE CASE READY FOR TRIAL, ONLY TO FIND THAT </p><p>THEY WERE UNABLE TO COMMENCE THE TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT TRIALS WERE TAKING TOO </p><p>LONG.  THIS IS THE FAULT OF BOTH DEFENSE COUNSEL, WHO JORDA </p><p>SAID HAVE INCENTIVES TO EXTEND THE LENGTH OF TRIALS BECAUSE </p><p>THEY ARE BEING WELL PAID UNDER U.N. SCALES, AND THE </p><p>PROSECUTORS, WHO ARE TOO "PERFECTIONIST" IN THE WAY THEY </p><p>CONDUCT TRIALS.  JORDA EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THE EXPERIENCE </p><p>THE JUDGES HAD GAINED BOTH WITH THE ICTY\'S RULES OF PROCEDURE </p><p>AND EVIDENCE, AS WELL AS THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNDERLYING </p><p>CONFLICT IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, WOULD MAKE FUTURE TRIALS </p><p>GO FASTER.  THE JUDGES WOULD ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK TO </p><p>ACCELERATE THE PACE OF TRIALS THROUGH STRENGTHENED RELIANCE </p><p>ON PRE-TRIAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  NEVERTHELESS, SOMETHING MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO </p><p>ADDRESS THE GROWING CASE BACKLOG PROBLEM.  JORDA TOLD </p><p>AMBASSADOR THAT THE JUDGES HAD REVIEWED A FULL RANGE OF </p><p>OPTIONS FOR TRYING CASES MORE SWIFTLY, INCLUDING HOLDING </p><p>TRIALS BEFORE A SINGLE JUDGE, HOLDING TRIALS IN ABSENTIA, </p><p>TRANSFERRING TRIALS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, OR ADDING A NEW TRIAL </p><p>CHAMBER.  WITH RESPECT TO MOST, THE DISADVANTAGES OUTWEIGHED </p><p>THE ADVANTAGES.  THE JUDGES HAD CONCLUDED, HOWEVER, THAT TWO </p><p>PROPOSALS COULD EFFECTIVELY ENHANCE THE ICTY\'S TRIAL </p><p>OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  FIRST, THE JUDGES RECOMMEND DELEGATING TO ICTY </p><p>SENIOR LEGAL OFFICERS SOME PRE-TRIAL MANAGEMENT </p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES, SUCH AS SETTING DEADLINES AND HEARING </p><p>WITNESS TESTIMONY BY DEPOSITION.  CORE LEGAL ISSUES WOULD NOT </p><p>BE HANDLED BY SENIOR LEGAL OFFICERS, AND A JUDGE WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO SUPERVISE THE WORK OF EACH SENIOR LEGAL OFFICER. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THIS WOULD PERMIT JUDGES TO DEVOTE A GREATER </p><p>PORTION OF THEIR TIME TO TRIAL WORK. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U)  SECOND, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE JUDGES HAVE </p><p>RECOMMENDED THE USE OF "AD LITEM" JUDGES, I.E., JUDGES DRAWN </p><p>FROM A POOL OF ELIGIBLE CANDIDATES WHO COULD SERVE FOR A </p><p>SINGLE CASE ONCE IT WAS READY FOR TRIAL.  THIS PROPOSAL WOULD </p><p>BE FLEXIBLE, AND AD LITEM JUDGES WOULD WORK ONLY ON AN </p><p>AS-NEEDED BASIS.  COUNTRIES COULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT EITHER </p><p>BY DESIGNATING JUDGES FOR THE POOL, OR BY MAKING VOLUNTARY </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF AD </p><p>LITEM JUDGES.  (JORDA\'S REPORT SPECIFICALLY REJECTS THE </p><p>NOTION OF COUNTRIES MAKING AD LITEM JUDGES AVAILABLE ON A </p><p>"GRATIS PERSONNEL" BASIS, IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY OF THE JUDGES.) JORDA NOTED </p><p>THAT THE JUDGES WERE DIVIDED ON WHETHER THE AD LITEM JUDGES </p><p>SHOULD SIT TOGETHER WITH EXISTING TRIBUNAL JUDGES, OR WHETHER </p><p>ENTIRE AUTONOMOUS AD LITEM PANELS SHOULD BE CONSTITUTED, </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE INDICATED HE FAVORED THE LATTER APPROACH TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT EXISTING JUDGES WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THEIR OWN </p><p>TRIALS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  JORDA INDICATED THAT THE PROPOSALS WOULD REQUIRE </p><p>SOME "MINOR" REVISIONS TO THE ICTY\'S STATUTE.  HIS REPORT </p><p>INCLUDES AS AN ANNEX THE CHANGES TO THE STATUTE THAT WOULD BE </p><p>NECESSARY TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE JUDGES\' PROPOSALS.  JORDA\'S </p><p>REPORT ALSO NOTES THAT USE OF AD LITEM JUDGES WOULD REQUIRE </p><p>ADDITIONAL RESOURCES, BUT INDICATES THAT SINCE FINANCING </p><p>QUESTIONS ARE NOT WITHIN THE JUDGES\' PURVIEW, THEY HAVE MADE </p><p>NO RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT POINT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U)  ACCORDING TO JORDA, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME </p><p>DIVISIONS AMONG THE JUDGES ABOUT THE PRECISE MODALITIES OF </p><p>THE AD LITEM PROPOSAL (E.G., WHETHER AD LITEM JUDGES SHOULD </p><p>BE ELECTED OR APPOINTED, WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE INTEGRATED </p><p>INTO EXISTING TRIAL CHAMBERS OR SERVE ON AUTONOMOUS TRIAL </p><p>CHAMBERS), THE BASIC RECOMMENDATIONS WERE UNANIMOUSLY </p><p>SUPPORTED BY THE JUDGES.  HE NOTED THAT CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL </p><p>PONTE ALSO HAD EXPRESSED HER APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSALS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  JORDA SAID THAT IF THE JUDGES\' RECOMMENDATIONS WERE </p><p>ADOPTED, THE ICTY WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLETE ITS TRIALS </p><p>BETWEEN 2007 AND 2009, RATHER THAN LATE 2016. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U)  JORDA\'S REPORT ALSO ADDRESSES POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS </p><p>TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THE APPEALS CHAMBER.  JORDA\'S REPORT </p><p>RECOMMENDS ADDING TWO NEW JUDGES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA (ICTR) TO THE APPEALS CHAMBER. </p><p>JORDA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE APPEALS CHAMBER WOULD </p><p>CONTINUE TO SIT AS A FIVE-JUDGE PANEL, BUT UNDER THE PROPOSAL </p><p>WOULD HAVE A POOL OF SEVEN JUDGES TO DRAW FROM IN </p><p>CONSTITUTING SUCH A PANEL.  (COMMENT: THIS ASPECT OF THE </p><p>PROPOSAL, HOWEVER, IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE WRITTEN REPORT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U)  THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED JORDA FOR THINKING </p><p>AHEAD ON THE ISSUE OF THE ICTY\'S CAPACITY TO MANAGE ITS </p><p>CASELOAD.  SHE AND LEGAL COUNSELOR CAUTIONED THAT IN VIEW OF </p><p>THE SEVERE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS FACING THE UNITED NATIONS, THE </p><p>ADDITIONAL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH AD LITEM JUDGES WAS </p><p>LIKELY TO PRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HURDLE TO THE </p><p>PROPOSAL.  NEVERTHELESS, THE FLEXIBLE NATURE OF THE AD LITEM </p><p>JUDGES PROPOSAL WAS AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE, SINCE JUDGES </p><p>WOULD ONLY BE PAID AS NECESSARY TO HANDLE CASES.  AMBASSADOR </p><p>REITERATED THE USG\'S STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE ICTY AND SAID THE </p><p>TRIBUNAL\'S MANY FRIENDS IN THE USG WOULD WANT TO PLAY A </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT ICTY </p><p>EFFORTS TO STRESS THE SEVERITY OF THE ICTY\'S BACKLOG COULD </p><p>WORK AGAINST THE PROSECUTOR\'S PUSH FOR MORE ARRESTS OF </p><p>AT-LARGE INDICTEES.  IN THAT REGARD, JORDA NOTED THAT DEL </p><p>PONTE FULLY SUPPORTS THE REPORT.  HE ALSO COMMENTED THAT </p><p>APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE ICTY\'S INDICTEES ARE STILL AT </p><p>LARGE.  "IF THAT WERE THE SITUATION IN ANY NATION," HE </p><p>COMMENTED, "THERE WOULD BE A REVOLUTION" IN THAT COUNTRY. </p><p>THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION, HE SAID, THAT ALL INDICTEES MUST BE </p><p>BROUGHT TO THE HAGUE, EITHER BY VOLUNTARILY SURRENDER OR </p><p>ARREST.  DEVELOPING A PROCESS FOR EXPEDITING TRIALS MIGHT </p><p>ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY SURRENDERS.  JORDA MENTIONED THAT </p><p>REPUBLIKA SRPSKA PRIME MINISTER DODIK, DURING HIS RECENT </p><p>VISIT TO THE CITY, SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE MORE </p><p>VOLUNTARY SURRENDERS BUT CANNOT GIVEN THE LENGTHY PRETRIAL </p><p>DELAYS FACED BY THOSE IN CUSTODY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (U)  COMMENT:  THE PROPOSAL FOR AD LITEM JUDGES COULD BE </p><p>AN EFFECTIVE AND RELATIVELY COST-EFFICIENT SOLUTION TO THE </p><p>GROWING BACKLOG PROBLEM AT THE ICTY.  PARTICULARLY IF THE </p><p>PROPOSAL ENABLES THE ICTY TO COMPLETE ITS MANDATE SOONER, IT </p><p>WOULD ACTUALLY RESULT IN LONG-TERM SAVINGS TO U.N. MEMBER </p><p>STATES.  AS SUCH, EMBASSY RECOMMENDS THAT WASHINGTON GIVE </p><p>SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO SUPPORTING JUDGE JORDA\'S PROPOSALS. </p><p>EMBASSY BELIEVES, HOWEVER, THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR AD </p><p>LITEM JUDGES TO BE INTEGRATED INTO PANELS WITH REGULAR ICTY </p><p>JUDGES.  OTHERWISE, THE AD LITEM TRIAL CHAMBERS WOULD NOT BE </p><p>ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE IMPORTANT EXPERIENCE THE PERMANENT </p><p>JUDGES HAVE GAINED WITH THE ICTY\'S RULES OF PROCEDURE AND </p><p>EVIDENCE AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONFLICT IN THE FORMER </p><p>YUGOSLAVIA.  EMBASSY CAUTIONS, HOWEVER, THAT FOR THE APPROACH </p><p>TO BE VIABLE, THE U.N. WILL NEED TO FUND MORE THAN THE </p><p>SALARIES OF THE AD LITEM JUDGES.  ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR </p><p>LEGAL ASSISTANTS, SECRETARIES, AND REGISTRY COURTROOM STAFF </p><p>WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED.  DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF TRIAL </p><p>CHAMBERS OPERATING AT ANY GIVEN TIME, IT MAY ALSO BE </p><p>NECESSARY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COURTROOM CAPACITY TO THE </p><p>ICTY.  ON THIS SCORE, JORDA MENTIONED THE POSSIBILITY OF </p><p>USING THE COURT FACILITIES AT CAMP ZEIST CURRENTLY BEING USED </p><p>FOR THE LOCKERBIE TRIAL, ONCE THOSE PROCEEDINGS ARE </p><p>COMPLETED.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17.  (U)  A COPY OF JUDGE JORDA\'S REPORT HAS BEEN FAXED TO </p><p>THE DEPARTMENT (S/WCI - SCHEFFER).  HARD COPY HAS BEEN SENT </p><p>TO THE DEPARTMENT (S/WCI - SCHEFFER, VIA L/CID) BY COMMERCIAL </p><p>COURIER. </p><p>FENDRICK </p><p></p></div>
