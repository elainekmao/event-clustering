<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000747 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOIST CASUALTIES IN DANG REPORTEDLY HIGH; </p><p>COCA-COLA FACTORY IN TERAI BOMBED AGAIN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 0737 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 0439 </p><p>     C. (C) KATHMANDU 0209 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  The Chief District Officer (CDO) in Dang </p><p>told the Embassy that he has seen "hundreds" of bodies of </p><p>Maoist dead in shallow graves in the vicinity of the April 11 </p><p>attacks on police and Armed Police Force posts (Ref A). </p><p>According to local press reports, some of those dead may be </p><p>villagers conscripted as cannon fodder, possibly used as </p><p>human shields, in the hours leading up to the attacks.  A </p><p>total of five civilians, including two small children, were </p><p>killed in recent explosions in two other districts.  No </p><p>injuries were reported after suspected Maoists set off </p><p>explosive devices for the second time at the Coca-Cola </p><p>bottling factory in Narayangadh (Ref C).  We expect the </p><p>violence to continue as the Maoists gear up for the general </p><p>strike called for April 23-27.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Ministry of Defense spokesman Tana Gautam has </p><p>confirmed that the bodies of 54 Maoist insurgents killed in </p><p>the April 11 attacks on the civilian police post at Lamahi </p><p>and the Armed Police Force (APF) post at Satbariya in Dang </p><p>district (Ref A) have been found in the vicinity around the </p><p>posts.  (Note:  Maoist combatants typically transport bodies </p><p>of their dead from battle sites.  End note.)   Gautam said </p><p>the number of Maoist dead could rise as the search for bodies </p><p>continues.  (Note: A PACOM assessment team is currently </p><p>visiting division headquarters in Nepalgunj and may learn </p><p>further details.  End note.)  The official casualty count for </p><p>Government of Nepal (GON) security forces in the attacks has </p><p>been revised to 10 regular police and 37 APF personnel.  Four </p><p>civilians on a night bus in the vicinity were also killed. </p><p>Dang Chief District Officer (CDO) Mathur Prasad Yadav told </p><p>Embassy April 15 that he had been out to the battle sites </p><p>that morning and estimated he had seen "hundreds" of bodies </p><p>of insurgents in shallow graves in the forest and along the </p><p>river bank.  He speculated that the Maoist casualty count </p><p>could reach as high as 500, although he was unable to say </p><p>exactly how many had been officially counted.  The police are </p><p>still in the process of digging up the graves to determine </p><p>the number of Maoist casualties, Yadav said. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) According to local press reports, the Maoists </p><p>impressed local residents of villages close to Satbariya to </p><p>serve as human shields shortly before the attack.  Relatives </p><p>of the men, who have been missing since April 11, reportedly </p><p>traveled to Satbariya to see if they could identify any of </p><p>the bodies discovered in the makeshift graves.  Local human </p><p>rights group INSEC said it has heard similar reports from the </p><p>field and is sending an assessment team to Nepalgunj to </p><p>investigate. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) On April 12 an improvised explosive device, </p><p>presumably planted by insurgents, killed two children in </p><p>Aakhibhuin, Sankhuwasabha, a remote district in northeastern </p><p>Nepal.  The CDO in Bajura District in northwestern Nepal told </p><p>Embassy that three civilians in Lanten Bazaar attempting to </p><p>defuse a pressure cooker bomb, apparently left by Maoists, </p><p>were killed when the device exploded early in the morning of </p><p>April 14. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  At about 7:45 p.m. April 14 five armed insurgents </p><p>entered the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Narayangadh in the </p><p>south-central Terai region and set off an explosive device. </p><p>No casualties were reported.  N.N. Singh, the Managing </p><p>Director of Coca-Cola in Nepal, traveled to Narayangadh April </p><p>15 to assess the damage to the plant.  This latest attack </p><p>marks the second time Maoists have targeted the Narayangadh </p><p>plant (Ref C) and the third time they have set off explosive </p><p>devices at a Coca-Cola facility in Nepal. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  According to Singh, the Nepali police did not </p><p>adequately increase the presence of armed police around the </p><p>plant, despite his own and the Ambassador\'s requests to do so </p><p>(Ref B).  Singh said he is convinced his plants are being </p><p>targeted as symbols of corporate America and asked the </p><p>Embassy to press the GON for augmented security around his </p><p>Kathmandu and Narayangadh facilities. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  Comment:  While we think it is unlikely that there </p><p>are "hundreds" of Maoist dead, it seems apparent that </p><p>casualties are higher than initially thought.  At this point </p><p>there is no telling how many of the bodies now turning up in </p><p>makeshift graves are actual Maoist cadre and how many may be </p><p>unfortunate villagers impressed into temporary and unwilling </p><p>service by the insurgents.  As the date of the general strike </p><p>called by the Maoists for April 23-27 draws nearer, we expect </p><p>the insurgents to increase the tempo of violence in a bid to </p><p>intimidate the general population into observing the </p><p>otherwise unpopular shutdown.  The Embassy will continue to </p><p>monitor the situation, and will hold an EAC meeting the day </p><p>before the strike in order to assess our security posture and </p><p>review any increased threat to the larger American community. </p><p> End comment. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
