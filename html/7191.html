<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002243 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EB AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR EDSON, FRIED, QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/07/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, EAID, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TRANCHING AND CONDITIONING OF U.S. ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>TURKEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U)  Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: </p><p>1.5(b,d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Assuming Congress approves $1 billion in ESF </p><p>assistance for Turkey, we expect the Turkish Government to </p><p>leverage that money into the largest possible package -- $8.5 </p><p>billion in long-term loans.  Prime Minister Erdogan has </p><p>stated this intention publicly, and numerous lower level </p><p>officials have confirmed it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) We understand Washington agencies are considering how </p><p>best to tranche and condition this assistance so that it both </p><p>enables Turkey to minimize the risk of short-term financial </p><p>instability and provides the strongest possible incentive for </p><p>the government to implement the sound policies necessary for </p><p>medium and long-term growth and debt sustainability. </p><p>(Normally, we would link disbursements to a financing gap. </p><p>In this case, there may be a balance of payments gap, but the </p><p>more urgent issue is a possible budget gap.  Unfortunately, </p><p>since that gap depends so much on market sentiment (and thus </p><p>interest rates), it is impossible to say now how large it </p><p>will be.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) From our perspective, it would be wise to spread the </p><p>disbursements out in four equal tranches, over 18 months, and </p><p>to link them as closely as possible to IMF and World Bank </p><p>programs.  Here\'s why: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- This government has clearly demonstrated that it will only </p><p>implement sound policies and structural reforms when it is </p><p>under clear pressure from its debt structure, the markets, </p><p>the IFIs or other international authorities, and that -- when </p><p>it comes to meeting IMF or World Bank conditions -- it will </p><p>delay policy decisions and implementation until the last </p><p>possible moment before a disbursement.  We can assume the </p><p>government will do little that is positive in between </p><p>IMF/WB/USG reviews and disbursements, so it is in our </p><p>interest not to allow too much time between those </p><p>disbursements; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Providing the assistance in less than four disbursements </p><p>would reduce the pressure on the GOT to perform.  First, it </p><p>would suggest a large initial disbursement of nearly $3 </p><p>billion (assuming three disbursements) -- enough in our view </p><p>to encourage GOT complacency.  Second, it would mean at least </p><p>a nine-month gap between disbursements.  Given the way this </p><p>government works, that would effectively mean no pressure to </p><p>perform (beyond the quarterly IMF reviews) for 6-8 months at </p><p>a stretch; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Although it is not practical for the U.S. to review and </p><p>disburse on a quarterly basis, we could manage semi-annual </p><p>disbursements while also using the IMF\'s quarterly reviews as </p><p>a proxy.  We might, for example, make clear to the GOT that </p><p>its successful completion of the 5th and 6th IMF reviews </p><p>(scheduled for August and October 2003) will be of paramount </p><p>importance in our decision about whether and when to release </p><p>our next tranche of assistance.  Such an approach would give </p><p>added weight to IMF performance criteria and maintain the </p><p>pressure on the GOT to perform, while still preserving our </p><p>ability to make independent disbursement decisions, including </p><p>by being firmer or more lenient than the IMF on specific </p><p>structural reforms; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- An explicit, close IMF link will enhance market </p><p>confidence, given the nearly complete lack of investor </p><p>confidence in this government\'s economic policies; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- While some may argue that Turkey needs a larger up-front </p><p>disbursement to calm financial markets, our sense from </p><p>talking to the investment community is that it is sound </p><p>government policy -- much more than additional international </p><p>borrowing -- that is key to short-term stability.  Moreover, </p><p>investors tell us that it is the fact of U.S. support, not </p><p>the absolute amounts, that has bolstered confidence in recent </p><p>days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The IMF program is scheduled to last another 18 months, </p><p>which matches nicely with what we understand to be the period </p><p>of disbursement for our assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) The GOT is likely to press for more money up-front </p><p>and for less IMF-related conditionality.  Again, from our </p><p>perspective, we have no reason to make concessions on these </p><p>points.  A disbursement schedule that spreads the assistance </p><p>out evenly over time and is closely linked to performance </p><p>under the IMF-backed program is far more likely to be </p><p>effective than the approach the GOT no doubt would favor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
