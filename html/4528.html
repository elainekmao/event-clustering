<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 002264 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, MOPS, ECON, PGOV, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  ARMY PLAN TO INITIATE INDUSTRIAL SECURITY </p><p>FORCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: KATHMANDU 2169 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In a November 21 meeting with Ambassadors and Nepali </p><p>business leaders, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen. Pyar Jung </p><p>Thapa announced plans to form a 3,000-man "industrial </p><p>security force" within the Royal Nepal Army (RNA).  If </p><p>approved by the Cabinet, this new force, which he expects to </p><p>be operational with the next six months, will be dedicated to </p><p>providing security for sensitive business and industrial </p><p>operations.  The General also discussed the possible creation </p><p>of "village defense forces," or local militias, in remote </p><p>areas, a proposal not favored by other senior military </p><p>leaders.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>INDUSTRIAL SECURITY FORCE ANNOUNCED </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  On November 21 Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen. Pyar </p><p>Jung Thapa briefed business leaders, heads of binational </p><p>Chambers of Commerce, and foreign ambassadors on plans to </p><p>form an "industrial security force" within the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA).  The mission of the new unit will be to provide </p><p>security to sensitive business and industrial establishments. </p><p>  Thapa proposed that 3,000 of the 10,000 new RNA recruits </p><p>will form the core of the new force.  The new force could be </p><p>trained and ready for deployment by May.  The proposal to </p><p>form the force is now before the Cabinet, he said. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  According to the proposal, the RNA will provide </p><p>the manpower, training and equipment for the force, Thapa </p><p>said, but private businesses benefiting from the enhanced </p><p>protection will be expected to provide food, uniforms, and </p><p>housing for the troops.  Thus all new business projects </p><p>should factor security costs into their budgets, he </p><p>cautioned.  (Note:  He did not provide estimated annual costs </p><p>for maintaining the force.  End note.)  Despite being tied </p><p>down with the tasks of providing security to 75 district </p><p>headquarters, sensitive infrastructure like airports and </p><p>hydroelectric plants, and key personnel and facilities within </p><p>the capital, the RNA must take on this additional role </p><p>because the civil police and Armed Police Force (APF) are </p><p>unable to do so at this time.  The RNA does not enjoy </p><p>performing such "peripheral duties," but recognizes its duty </p><p>to do so, Thapa said, noting the Army\'s patrolling of customs </p><p>checkpoints had resulted in a 30-40 percent increase in </p><p>revenue collection. The RNA will begin the task of protecting </p><p>businesses; the civil police and APF will then pick up their </p><p>share of the burden later as their capability improves.  The </p><p>RNA can advise investors and entrepreneurs on site selection </p><p>for new projects, he added.  Ambassador Malinowski suggested </p><p>that the RNA designate a point of contact for businessmen </p><p>with questions or concerns regarding security.  Thapa agreed </p><p>to do so. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>VILLAGE DEFENSE FORCES </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)   The military alone, stretched as it is with </p><p>"peripheral duties" and maintaining security at key sites, </p><p>cannot counter the insurgency, Thapa warned.  The APF is not </p><p>yet adequately trained, and is "only taking up resources </p><p>right now."  The RNA is thus considering developing "a new </p><p>strategy" of employing "village defense forces" to supplement </p><p>security in remote areas.  Villagers would be trained and </p><p>armed with shotguns and muskets.  The villagers would be the </p><p>first line of defense under this strategy, while the RNA </p><p>would provide "a reaction force."  Members of the new </p><p>militias could also provide information on Maoist activities </p><p>and plans so the RNA could mount large-scale attacks.  For </p><p>this strategy to work, formation of the militias must also be </p><p>linked up with solid rural development plans for these areas, </p><p>Thapa noted.  The UK Ambassador suggested that his goverment </p><p>might be able to provide some experts on civil defense forces </p><p>to assist with this strategy. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>HOW ARE THE MAOISTS DOING? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The Maoists\' savage tactics have eroded their </p><p>erstwhile popular support, Thapa declared.  Only about 20-30 </p><p>percent of their current forces are "hard-core," he </p><p>estimated, while another 50 percent may have been conscripted </p><p>forcibly into their ranks.  Rural areas have been depopulated </p><p>as one-time residents flee forced conscription.  The Maoists\' </p><p>new strategy is to target schoolchildren for recruitment, </p><p>Thapa said. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The RNA controls the headquarters of all 75 </p><p>districts.  Outside district headquarters, however, is </p><p>another matter, Thapa acknowledged.  Some districts, such as </p><p>Rolpa, are almost completely Maoist.  He speculated that the </p><p>Maoists may be attempting to move south of their original </p><p>power base in Rukum-Rolpa-Jajarkot, where most of the people </p><p>are ethnic Magar, toward Dang, where much of the population </p><p>are disaffected Tharus and Kamaiyas, the former bonded </p><p>laborer class.  The Maoists appear better armed than before, </p><p>he continued, and undoubtedly have better weapons and </p><p>training than the civilian police.  In the battle in Jumla, </p><p>for example (Reftel), they fired 81 mm mortars at close </p><p>range.   The insurgents occupied civilian homes in their </p><p>effort to take the district headquarters, making it difficult </p><p>for the RNA to return fire.  Nonetheless, the RNA battalion </p><p>succeeded in turning back a Maoist attack at the brigade </p><p>level.  The RNA had improved perimeter defenses around the </p><p>headquarters.  In the past, the Maoists have successfully </p><p>used hooks to pull apart barbed wire defenses.  In Jumla, </p><p>however, the RNA had used double and triple strands of barbed </p><p>wire that the Maoists had been unable to penetrate. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The Maoists are not sincere about dialogue, Thapa </p><p>asserted, adding the RNA had captured Maoist documents </p><p>indicating that talks were to be used only as a ploy. </p><p>Nonetheless, talks can be a good thing, he suggested, and the </p><p>Government must remain open to them.  Altogether, 16,000 </p><p>Maoists have surrendered, he noted, but the Government still </p><p>lacks an effective program for their rehabilitation.  Right </p><p>now, surrendered Maoists are put on parole, whence they </p><p>frequently disappear.  Thapa said he has raised with the </p><p>Government the possibility of setting up rehabilitation </p><p>camps, as had been operational in Sri Lanka.  Such camps </p><p>could also be a magnet to draw in others debating whether to </p><p>surrender, he said. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The business community, caught between frequent </p><p>general strikes and even more frequent extortion demands, has </p><p>been pleading with the RNA to augment its protection of key </p><p>business and investment enterprises.  The RNA, strapped for </p><p>both human and financial resources, is clearly looking to the </p><p>business community to fill at least part of the budgetary </p><p>shortfall.  Gen. Thapa\'s presentation is the first indication </p><p>of any RNA enthusiasm we have heard for the concept of local </p><p>militias.  Clearly a village defense force is a difficult </p><p>program to implement successfully for a variety of reasons, </p><p>including caste and educational disparities, logistical </p><p>factors, and security concerns.  The RNA and the Government </p><p>will have to plan very carefully how to train, equip, and </p><p>employ this local militia, lest it become a hapless victim of </p><p>the Maoists and a source of additional weapons for them. </p><p>Other senior military leaders have told us that they have </p><p>serious doubts about this proposal. When informed of the </p><p>concept, IGP Shrestha of the APF quipped that it would be </p><p>better to supply the villagers with cell phones (which </p><p>Shrestha knows would not work in most of Nepal) than arms. </p><p>What the Government most needs from the villagers is timely </p><p>intelligence, Shrestha said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
