O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimdollar Tumbles Further </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: The Zimdollar has fallen another 25 percent </p><p>from Z$3350 to 4200:US$1.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. In early May, the Zimdollar still traded at </p><p>Z$1450:US$1, so the three month devaluation stands at </p><p>around two-thirds.  While a number of factors are </p><p>weakening the Zimdollar, oil parastatal NOCZIM has been </p><p>aggressively selling 91-day bonds and converting the </p><p>proceeds into U.S. dollars for fuel purchases.  (Even so, </p><p>NOCZIM is only supplying subsidized fuel to the GOZ\'s own </p><p>vehicles and some commuter vans.)  The largest Zimbabwean </p><p>note is now worth 12 US cents.  A Z$ 1 coin, still widely </p><p>circulated, exchanges for US$.0002.  If you carry 42 of </p><p>these bulky coins in your pocket, you have one US cent. </p><p> </p><p>3. Comment: Through accelerating inflation and a </p><p>weakening Zimdollar, the GOZ is confronted with its </p><p>failed economic policies.  The Zimdollar has nearly </p><p>fallen below the Zambian Kwacha, currently trading at </p><p>4560:US$1, a psychological barrier for a country that </p><p>once looked down its nose at poorer neighbors. </p><p> </p><p>Whitehead </p><p></p></div>
