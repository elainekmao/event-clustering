<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004834 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/31/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH PARLIAMENT PASSES NSC REFORM PACKAGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 4804 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 4544 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass. Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Parliament late July 30 unanimously approved </p><p>the AK Government\'s seventh EU-related reform package.  As </p><p>noted in reftels, the most important -- and controversial -- </p><p>aspects of the package concerned changes to the National </p><p>Security Council (NSC).  Though limited in scope, the NSC </p><p>reforms -- if enacted and implemented -- are a positive step </p><p>toward increasing elected civilian authority in Turkey.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>The Package </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The law includes the following provisions: 1) the NSC </p><p>SecGen will be assigned by the prime minister with the </p><p>approval of the president, and will report to a Deputy P.M. </p><p>rather than directly to the P.M. -- a move widely understood </p><p>as diminishing the SecGen\'s political status; 2) the NSC </p><p>shall meet every two months, or at the discretion of the </p><p>prime minister or president; and 3) making the NSC agenda and </p><p>procedures/guidelines less formally peremptory.  In addition </p><p>to these changes, the package also contained reforms designed </p><p>to ease restrictions on freedom of expression and expedite </p><p>torture cases in the courts.  The final version does not, </p><p>however, bring military spending under Parliamentary </p><p>supervision, as AK had initially wanted.  Instead, the </p><p>expenditures of all "public and private institutions" will be </p><p>subject to review by the Court of Accounts (Sayistay).  The </p><p>package pointedly notes that "the supervision of the assets </p><p>of the Armed Forces will be made in line with the principle </p><p>of secrecy as required by the national defense services," </p><p>which in practice will severely limit civilian </p><p>governmental/parliamentary oversight of the military. </p><p>Moreover, the presidency will also remain exempt from </p><p>Sayistay review. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>Support from Both Sides of the Aisle </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) During the debate on the floor, former Foreign </p><p>Minister and AK deputy Yasar Yakis stressed that the latest </p><p>reforms are "only one phase of harmonization with EU </p><p>regulations" and that the GOT\'s efforts will continue. </p><p>Justice Minister and Government Spokesman Cemil Cicek added </p><p>that "Turkey has taken an important step on the way to </p><p>joining the EU and toward more healthy democracy and more </p><p>open society."  Although opposition CHP leader Baykal had </p><p>expressed publicly some reservations about the need for </p><p>further reform, all CHP deputies apparently endorsed the </p><p>package.  M.P. and Deputy Group Chairman Ozyurek stated that </p><p>his party supported the laws not to gain entry into the EU, </p><p>but for the benefit of the Turkish people.  Retired </p><p>Ambassador and CHP deputy Onur Oymen cautioned the GOT not to </p><p>pursue, as part of the EU-related packages, reforms beyond </p><p>the scope of what was required by the EU.  Oymen pointed out </p><p>that holding NSC meetings every two months, for example, was </p><p>not part of the Copenhagen criteria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Back-Stage Views </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Privately to us just after the vote, comments by </p><p>senior and other prominent AK M.P.s -- including party Vice </p><p>Chairman Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat (Mersin), the ethnically </p><p>Kurdish de facto Number Two in the Party organization and </p><p>director of AK\'s outreach to the Kurds; Human Rights </p><p>Commission member Ersonmez Yarbay (Ankara); Eyyup Sanay </p><p>(Ankara), an AK founding member and Foreign Affairs </p><p>Commission Spokesman; and Zulfukar Izol (Sanliurfa), scion of </p><p>a leading Kurdish tribe -- ranged from modest pleasure to </p><p>mild disappointment with what they regarded as a diluted </p><p>final package.  Yarbay explained that the time simply was </p><p>"not right" to push comprehensive steps to redress </p><p>civilian-military relations; he noted that the Government is </p><p>contemplating when/how to put on its agenda more wide-ranging </p><p>measures, including the related issues of budgeting and </p><p>corruption in the military.  In this regard, Istanbul AK M.P. </p><p>Mehmet Denizolgun, whose family heads the wealthy and </p><p>politically influential Suleymanci tarikat (nominally illegal </p><p>sufi order), offered to us privately on July 31 that the </p><p>upcoming meeting of the Supreme Military Council (YAS) will </p><p>be critical in determining whether moderate TGS Chief Ozkok </p><p>can push aside the hard-liners in the senior ranks who have </p><p>been resisting reform. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CHP M.P. Bulent Tanla, who is close to Party chief </p><p>Deniz Baykal, sounded a more positive note.  The reforms are </p><p>a very positive step that should be viewed favorably by the </p><p>EU, he told us July 31.  However, Necdet Budak, a CHP M.P. </p><p>from Edirne who is a strong supporter of Kemal Dervis\'s calls </p><p>for intraparty reform, took a more cautious stance. </p><p>Implementation will be "extremely important" in determining </p><p>whether the laws will have any effect, he said.  "There is an </p><p>entrenched system, and whether the changes will be accepted </p><p>by that system remains to be seen." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Though the reforms are limited in scope and received </p><p>unanimity support in the Parliament, it is an open question </p><p>whether President Sezer, who has 15 days to deliberate, will </p><p>approve the law.  Sezer\'s track record is characterized by </p><p>repeated efforts to obstruct and delay the AK reform program </p><p>in the interest of the status quo; he vetoed AK\'s sixth EU </p><p>package, dealing in part with reforms to stringent </p><p>anti-terror laws, despite unanimous support from both sides </p><p>of the aisle. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The NSC reforms -- if enacted and implemented -- are a </p><p>positive step toward increasing elected civilian authority in </p><p>Turkey, although AK did not get everything it wanted, </p><p>particularly in the crucial area of military budget </p><p>oversight.  Moreover, as reported reftels, Erdogan is trying </p><p>to avoid confrontation with the TGS before the YAS, and is </p><p>particularly interested in making it easier on Ozkok, who in </p><p>recent weeks has been under considerable pressure from </p><p>military hard-liners.  Such restraint can be laudable, given </p><p>the potential for overreaction from Establishment circles. </p><p>Nevertheless, it carries with it an inherent risk of </p><p>undermining reform momentum and preserving hard-line equities </p><p>in NSC-related and other matters. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
