(SBU) DepEconCouns delivered reftel points on September 18  to </p><p>Dr. Nike-Catherine Koutrakou, Director of Emergency Humanitarian </p><p>and Food Aid Programs at Hellenic Aid (HA).  On September 23, Dr. </p><p>Koutrakou advised DepEconCouns that the GoG has made Ethiopia and </p><p>Somalia two of its highest priority countries for assistance (in </p><p>addition to Afghanistan and the Palestinian Authority).  While </p><p>Kenya is not one of Greece\'s high priority countries, the GoG has </p><p>allocated assistance funding to it and will continue to do so.  In </p><p>addition, Koutrakou has proposed to HA\'s leadership that Kenya be </p><p>added to Greece\'s list of high priority countries.  Koutrakou </p><p>advised that to date in 2009, HA has given to the World Food </p><p>Program (WFP) EUR450,000 for Ethiopia, EUR150,000 for Somalia, and </p><p>EUR300,000 for Kenya.  In response to the most recent humanitarian </p><p>appeal, Koutrakou told DepEconCouns that she has proposed to </p><p>Ambassador Mercourios Karafotias, Director General of Hellenic Aid, </p><p>that Greece donate an additional EUR300,000 for these three </p><p>countries through the WFP.  No decision, however, can be made on </p><p>whether and when to provide this additional assistance until a new </p><p>Greek government assumes power [Note: Greece\'s Prime Minister </p><p>recently called snap elections, which will take place on October 4. </p><p>End Note].  Reiterating statements made by Ambassador Karafotias to </p><p>DepEconCouns in the past, Koutrakou emphasized that Foreign </p><p>Minister Dora Bakoyannis wants HA, which falls under the MFA, to </p><p>support USG assistance priorities whenever possible.  While </p><p>Koutrakou is not sure whether this policy will be continued under a </p><p>new government, if the MFA\'s new political leaders are put in place </p><p>in a timely fashion and agree, HA could be in a position to donate </p><p>the EUR300,000 to the WFP by mid-November. </p><p>Speckhard </p><p></p></div>
