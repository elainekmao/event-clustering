<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 VATICAN 001124 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), IO/UNP, AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PHUM, VT, VTPREL, religious freedom </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE TO FOCUS ON HUMAN DIGNITY, RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM AT 59TH UNHRC </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) SECSTATE 64728 </p><p> </p><p>     B. B) VATICAN 531 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION, BRENT HARDT.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01124  01 OF 02  190648Z </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION TO THE 59TH UN HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>COMMISSION CONVEYED TO EMBASSY ITS WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH </p><p>US TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF MUTUAL INTEREST, PARTICULARLY </p><p>ECONOMIC AND DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND </p><p>MIGRATION.  HOLY SEE DELEGATE TO THE UNHRC, BISHOP DIARMUID </p><p>MARTIN, SITS ON THE WORKING GROUP ON TRIPS AND PUBLIC HEALTH, </p><p>AND CAN BE EXPECTED TO PRESS THE HOLY SEE\'S POSITION THAT </p><p>DEVELOPED COUNTRIES MUST SHOW GREATER SOLIDARITY WITH THE </p><p>POOR.  THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION, THOUGH NON-VOTING, IS WILLING </p><p>TO WORK BEHIND THE SCENES ON COUNTRY RESOLUTIONS, WITH THE </p><p>PROVISO THAT SUCH RESOLUTIONS ARE "CONSTRUCTIVE."  THEY </p><p>SPECIFICALLY OFFERED TO WORK WITH US ON THE BELARUS </p><p>RESOLUTION.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>AVOIDING POLARIZATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  POLOFF AND POLINTERN MET MARCH 17 WITH THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S DIRECTOR FOR UN ISSUES, MSGR. ETTORE BALESTRERO TO </p><p>REVIEW THE U.S. POSITIONS ON KEY UNHRC ISSUES AND SOLICIT </p><p>VATICAN SUPPORT FOR OUR APPROACH.  WHILE NOTING THAT THE HOLY </p><p>SEE DOES NOT VOTE ON THE COMMISSION, BALESTRERO SAID IT TAKES </p><p>THE COMMISSION\'S WORK SERIOUSLY AND WILL ENGAGE ACTIVELY AT </p><p>THE HRC, BOTH BEHIND THE SCENES AND OCCASIONALLY OPENLY WITH </p><p>PARTNERS, TO ADVANCE ITS HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA.  THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>GENERAL APPROACH AT THE 59TH UNHRC WOULD BE TO SEEK WHAT THEY </p><p>REGARD AS "CONSTRUCTIVE" HRC RESOLUTIONS THAT OFFER COUNTRIES </p><p>THE OPPORTUNITY TO "GO STRAIGHT" RATHER THAN SIMPLY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01124  01 OF 02  190648Z </p><p>CONDEMNING AND PUNISHING THEM.  BALESTRERO SAID THEY WOULD </p><p>URGE THE HRC TO BE SENSITIVE TO SIGNALS FROM COUNTRIES TRYING </p><p>TO DEVELOP, YET NOT FULLY IN LINE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>STANDARDS.  BALESTRERO STRESSED SEVERAL TIMES THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>WISH THAT THE HRC NOT BECOME POLITICIZED -- A DISTINCT </p><p>POSSIBILITY GIVEN THE COUNTRIES NOW SITTING ON THE </p><p>COMMISSION.  HE SPECIFICALLY NOTED THE LIBYAN CHAIRMANSHIP AS </p><p>POTENTIALLY POLARIZING, AND NEEDING CAREFUL TREATMENT TO </p><p>ENSURE CONSTRUCTIVE OUTCOMES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>AREAS OF COOPERATION </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  TURNING TO AREAS FOR POTENTIAL U.S.-HOLY SEE </p><p>COOPERATION AT THE HRC, MSGR. BALESTRERO FIRST NOTED THAT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE LANGUAGE OF BEIJING  5, AND </p><p>THAT WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO INSERT MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL </p><p>LANGUAGE ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH TO THE DRAFT TEXT.  SECONDLY, </p><p>HE EXPLAINED THE HOLY SEE\'S DESIRE TO MONITOR CLOSELY THE </p><p>RESOLUTION ON AIDS FOR LANGUAGE WHICH MIGHT CREATE PROBLEMS </p><p>FOR BOTH OF US.  READING FROM THE DRAFT AGENDA, BALESTRERO </p><p>LISTED FOUR ADDITIONAL AREAS IN WHICH THE HOLY SEE AND USG </p><p>COULD COOPERATE:  RACISM; GLOBALIZATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS; </p><p>RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE AND MIGRATION.  AS FOR COUNTRY </p><p>RESOLUTIONS, HE OFFERED BELARUS AS ONE COUNTRY WHERE THE HOLY </p><p>SEE DELEGATION WILL TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN NEGOTIATING A </p><p>RESOLUTION.  THOUGH HE ADMITTED THE 2002 BELARUS LAW ON </p><p>RELIGIONS IS NOT SPECIFICALLY A ROMAN CATHOLIC ISSUE, IT DOES </p><p>HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CHURCH IN BELARUS.  MOREOVER, THE </p><p>HOLY SEE IS COMMITTED TO PROMOTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        VATICA  01124  01 OF 02  190648Z </p><p>EVERYWHERE.  PRESSED ON THE CUBA RESOLUTION, BALESTRERO NOTED </p><p>HOLY SEE CONCERNS AT THE LACK OF PROGRESS ON HUMAN AND </p><p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CUBA, BUT DID NOT COMMIT TO ACTIVELY </p><p>WORKING ON THE RESOLUTION.  HE URGED USDEL TO BE IN CONTACT </p><p>WITH THE HOLY SEE\'S PERMANENT OBSERVER, BISHOP DIARMUID </p><p>MARTIN, AND WELCOMED THE OPPORTUNITY OF FURTHER CONSULTATIONS </p><p>AND DISCUSSION OF TEXTS OF RESOLUTIONS DURING THE SESSION. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>DOHA TRIPS, ECONOMIC, DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS IN FOCUS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) BALESTRERO SIGNALED TO EMBOFF\'S THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>CONTINUING CONCERN THAT THE U.S. WAS BACKING AWAY FROM ITS </p><p>PREVIOUS STRONG SUPPORT OF THE DOHA DECLARATION ON TRIPS AND </p><p>PUBLIC HEALTH.  POLOFF EXPLAINED THE USG VIEW THAT AT DOHA </p><p>AGREEMENTS WERE LIMITED TO CERTAIN COMMUNICABLE DISEASE </p><p>EMERGENCIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, AND THAT A NUMBER OF </p><p>COUNTRIES NOW APPEARED TO WANT TO EXPAND THE DOHA AGREEMENT </p><p>BEYOND THE AGREED FRAMEWORK.  AS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY CONVEYED </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9242 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        VATICA  01124  02 OF 02  190648Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AMAD-00  EVG-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      MED-07   NSAE-00  OIC-02   PA-00    SSO-00   SS-00    R-00 </p><p>      EPAE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-01   SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------46C134  190648Z /38 </p><p>O 190644Z MAR 03 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY VATICAN </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>INFO HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION COLLECTIVE PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 VATICAN 001124 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), IO/UNP, AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: HOLY SEE TO FOCUS ON HUMAN DIGNITY, RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM AT 59TH UNHRC </p><p> </p><p>TO THE HOLY SEE (REF B), THE U.S., FAR FROM BACKING AWAY, HAD </p><p>UNILATERALLY DECLARED A MORATORIUM ON CERTAIN PATENT </p><p>ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IN ORDER TO ENSURE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO </p><p>CRITICAL MEDICINES FOR THE POOREST COUNTRIES AND CONTINUED TO </p><p>WORK TO ACHIEVE AN AGREED FRAMEWORK.  BALESTRERO INDICATED </p><p>THAT BISHOP MARTIN, WHO SITS ON THE HRC WORKING GROUP THAT </p><p>WILL ADDRESS THIS AND OTHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES, </p><p>CONTINUED TO BELIEVE THAT THE USG WAS BACKING AWAY FROM A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  01124  02 OF 02  190648Z </p><p>DOHA UNDERTAKING TO ENSHRINE THE TRIPS MORATORIUM IN THE WTO. </p><p> THE HOLY SEE, BELIEVING THE RIGHT TO MEDICAL CARE IS A CORE </p><p>HUMAN RIGHT, WILL WORK TO HAVE THE PRINCIPLE MADE PART OF THE </p><p>WTO FRAMEWORK, HE ADDED. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  THE HOLY SEE CONTINUES TO REGARD THE RIGHT TO </p><p>DEVELOPMENT AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, AND CAN THEREFORE BE </p><p>EXPECTED TO SEEK TO PUSH THE ENVELOP ON THESE ISSUES FURTHER </p><p>THAN WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE.  BALESTRERO OBSERVED THAT THE U.S. </p><p>APPEARS TO THE HOLY SEE AT TIMES AS FOCUSING TOO MUCH ON </p><p>POLITICAL AND CIVIC RIGHTS AT THE EXPENSE OF SOCIAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS.  POLOFF REITERATED THE U.S. VIEW </p><p>THAT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT COULD ONLY TAKE PLACE IN </p><p>AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE POLITICAL RIGHTS WERE GUARANTEED AND </p><p>THERE WAS RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW.  FURTHERMORE, POLOFF </p><p>NOTED THAT DEVELOPMENT ISSUES WERE BEST ADDRESSED IN OTHER UN </p><p>FORA. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAQ </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IN A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN </p><p>IRAQ, BALESTRERO CALLED THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THAT </p><p>COUNTRY "CATASTROPHIC," AND EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT THE </p><p>SITUATION WILL BE SOLVED WITHOUT RESORTING TO VIOLENCE.  HE </p><p>WAS OPEN TO WORKING ON AN EVENTUAL RESOLUTION, WHILE NOTING </p><p>THAT THE SITUATION IS NOW SO FLUID THAT ALL COUNTRIES WILL </p><p>HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  01124  02 OF 02  190648Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) THE HOLY SEE IS CLEARLY A WILLING PARTNER ON MOST </p><p>ISSUES FACING THE UNHRC.  THOUGH WE DISAGREE WITH THEIR </p><p>DESIRE TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC AND DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS IN THIS </p><p>FORUM, ON OTHER ISSUES BEFORE THE COMMISSION, OUR VIEWS ARE </p><p>CLOSE AND COOPERATION IS POSSIBLE.   BISHOP DIARMUID MARTIN, </p><p>FORMER SECRETARY OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND </p><p>PEACE (AND 1980\'S INTERNATIONAL VISITOR TO THE U.S.), WILL BE </p><p>A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR CORE HOLY SEE VIEWS IN THE </p><p>SOCIAL/ECONOMIC REALM AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY PUSH FOR THOSE </p><p>ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED AND \'CONSTRUCTIVELY\' RESOLVED AT THIS </p><p>YEAR\'S COMMISSION. (THIS CABLE WAS DRAFTED BY POLITICAL </p><p>SECTION INTERN MATT TAYLOR). </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2003VATICA01124 </p><p></p></div>
