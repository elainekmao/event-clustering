<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000653 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/W, AF/EPS AND EB/TPP </p><p>SATE PASS COMMERCE FOR ITA/MAC </p><p>STATE PASS USTR </p><p>CAIRO FOR MAXSTADT </p><p>PARIS FOR OECD/IEA </p><p>TASHKENT FOR BURKHALTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EPET, ENRG, EINV, PGOV, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DELTA OIL CRISIS MAY PINCH THE ECONOMY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: LAGOS 731 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p>1. News that Chevron returned to Escravos to gradually resume </p><p>oil production is encouraging. Shell also may soon return. </p><p>However, armed local groups remain a wild card. Their ability </p><p>to foil resumption of oil production is all too real as </p><p>evidenced by the April 6 pipeline disruption only a few days </p><p>after Chevron announced the resumption plan. Even under the </p><p>most roseate projections for resumption of oil production at </p><p>the sites, financial damage has been done to the GON and, by </p><p>extension, the national economy. Deputy Director of the </p><p>Central Bank Research Department Olekah told Econoff on April </p><p>5 that the ongoing crisis in Warri (reftel.) would affect GON </p><p>finances and macroeconomic policy. The hit taken by the oil </p><p>sector, combined with the related domestic gasoline shortage, </p><p>will stifle economic output and activity during the first </p><p>half of 2003 and maybe the third quarter as well. This is bad </p><p>news for President Obasanjo\'s reelection prospects. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Government Spending Likely to Fall </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>2. About 90 percent of government revenues are derived from </p><p>profits on oil sales. Deputy Director of the Central Bank </p><p>Research Department Olekah told Econoff on April 5 that with </p><p>fixed costs for oil production unchanged, the 40 percent cut </p><p>in oil output could translate into an even larger cut in </p><p>Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) profits </p><p>remitted to GON accounts. (Comment: The story is the same </p><p>even for a 25 percent cut in output, as would be the case if </p><p>Chevron\'s Escravos facility does come back online soon. </p><p>Meanwhile, falling world oil prices could compound the </p><p>problem. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. GON spending is difficult to track, but Olekah says </p><p>spending increased somewhat over the first quarter of 2003, </p><p>the run-up to elections in April. That spending was financed </p><p>by larger than expected profits on oil, as prices reached a </p><p>high of $35/barrel for Bonny Light and Nigeria pumped about </p><p>2.08 million bpd., well above GON budget estimates of </p><p>$18/barrel for 1.8 million bpd. (Comment: Given the </p><p>significant drop in revenue, the GON\'s spend-as-you-earn </p><p>budget rule could put a break on spending during or shortly </p><p>after this crucial election period, unless the GON decides to </p><p>abandon its 12.5 percent cap on deficit financing. State and </p><p>local government spending, with more limited access to </p><p>deficit financing, may be forced to cut spending even more </p><p>than the federal government. In particular, southern states </p><p>that benefit from the GON oil derivation rule may be hard </p><p>hit. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Downward Pressure on the Naira </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>4. Nearly all foreign exchange earnings are derived from NNPC </p><p>oil sales. Consequently, Olekah admitted, foreign exchange </p><p>reserves are taking a hit because of the crisis. He could not </p><p>provide current figures, but said depletion of the reserves </p><p>could be significant if the crisis continues, unless the GON </p><p>decides to devalue the naira. (Comment: The GON will be </p><p>reluctant to devalue the naira--devaluation is a policy tool </p><p>of last resort here. It is more likely that the GON will tap </p><p>into its foreign currency holdings over the next couple </p><p>months to maintain current import levels while also propping </p><p>up the inflated naira. Should the crisis linger, however, </p><p>that option would prove unsustainable, and a substantial </p><p>devaluation--popular or not--would be the only option left. </p><p>Over the last three weeks, the exchange rate has held steady </p><p>at 127 naira/dollar. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment: Macroeconomic Impact Could be Far-Reaching </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>5. The oil sector accounts for about 12.5 percent of Nigerian </p><p>GDP, so we can expect to see economic growth take a </p><p>noticeable hit as a result of this crisis. Oil service </p><p>companies and other companies dependent on oil production </p><p>will suffer most. The government also will be hamstrung in </p><p>meeting cash calls for joint-venture production agreements, </p><p>which, in turn, will slow further investment in the oil </p><p>sector. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. However, direct losses sustained by the oil sector are </p><p>only part of the equation--the other is the economic impact </p><p>of gasoline shortages (reftel.). The transportation system is </p><p>grinding to a halt, delaying and increasing the costs of the </p><p>movement of goods (food, for example) and services (labor) </p><p>and causing employers to scramble for inputs--especially </p><p>diesel needed to run generators that augment unreliable power </p><p>provided by NEPA. In addition, with the oil crisis </p><p>constraining government spending at all levels, fiscal policy </p><p>will be unavailable as a tool to cushion the blow. It is too </p><p>early to tell what impact this economic slowdown will have on </p><p>President Obasanjo\'s reelection prospects for April 19. End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment: Gasoline Price Controls </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>7. If there is any silver lining to this clouded scenario, it </p><p>is that the GON can mitigate some of the oil crisis\' impact </p><p>on the average Nigerian by removing price controls on </p><p>gasoline. After suffering through hours-long gas lines for </p><p>several weeks now, many consumers would be willing to spend </p><p>more than the 26 naira/liter service stations now charge. </p><p>Black market fuel sells for between 120 and 150/liter, and </p><p>people are paying the higher price. However, there are </p><p>political concerns about increasing gasoline prices during </p><p>the election period; also, influential vested interests whose </p><p>profiteering in the black market would be diminished should </p><p>market forces be allowed to determine domestic gas prices </p><p>would oppose lifting controls.
