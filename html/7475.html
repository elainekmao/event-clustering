<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000691 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA/INS AND DS/IP/SA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/15/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS TO MEET EMBOFFS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 0677 </p><p> </p><p>     B. (B) STATE 90666 </p><p>     C. (C) STATE 74113 </p><p>     D. (D) KATHMANDU 0621 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Following Ref C guidance, on April 16 poloff </p><p>contacted known Maoist sympathizer Padma Ratna Tuladhar to </p><p>convey Embassy agreement to meet at the First Secretary level </p><p>with Maoist representatives.  Poloff advised Tuladhar that </p><p>the RSO will also participate in the meeting, which has been </p><p>tentatively scheduled for the afternoon of Friday, April 25, </p><p>at the Embassy. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Poloff stipulated that the meeting will be </p><p>contingent upon Maoist conduct during the upcoming strikes </p><p>scheduled by various student unions (Ref A).  Tuladhar </p><p>protested that the Maoists are not sponsoring the strikes and </p><p>cannot be held accountable for them.  Poloff countered that </p><p>the Embassy will indeed hold the Maoists responsible for the </p><p>behavior of its affiliated student union and reminded him </p><p>that Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai had been quoted in the </p><p>press as saying the Maoists "support" the strikes.  She added </p><p>that there must be no press coverage of the meeting. </p><p>Tuladhar agreed that the appointment would be kept </p><p>"confidential."  He promised to contact poloff with the names </p><p>and dates of birth of the proposed participants. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Comment:  It remains to be seen whether Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai will accept a meeting held at the more modest level </p><p>of First Secretary, rather than Ambassador.  Tuladhar\'s </p><p>dissembling notwithstanding, we expect the Maoists will </p><p>attempt to exploit any meeting for publicity purposes.  If </p><p>so, we will use the press guidance provided in Ref B. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
