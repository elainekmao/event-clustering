<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 003619 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/06/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: (U) KUWAITI SHI\'IS DESCRIBE TRIP TO NAJAF AND </p><p>KARBALA, OFFER ADVICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: ADCM John G. Moran for reasons 1.5 (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  A group of prominent Kuwaiti Shia </p><p>businessmen recently briefed the Ambassador on their visit to </p><p>the Shia spiritual centers of Najaf and Karbala.  The group </p><p>met with Shia leaders who shared their concerns that the </p><p>security situation in the holy cities had still not been </p><p>properly addressed.  The Shia leaders, who included Grand </p><p>Ayatollah Ali Sistani and Mohammed Bahr Al-Oloum, also gave </p><p>the Kuwaitis advice to pass on to the USG on how to stabilize </p><p>the situation in Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) The Ambassador met with prominent Kuwaiti businessmen </p><p>Jawad Bukhamseen and Abdul Ilah Marafie on July 18. Also </p><p>present were two of Bukhamseen\'s sons, Anwar and Raed, and </p><p>Poloff (notetaker).  Bukhamseen and Marafie had recently </p><p>returned from a trip which took them into the Shia holy </p><p>cities of Najaf and Karbala.  There, they met with Shia </p><p>clerics Mohammed Bahr Al-Oloum, Mohammed Baquer Al-Hakim, </p><p>Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, Sayed Mohmammed Saeed Al-Hakim </p><p>and Shaikh Ishaq Al-Fadhli and discussed with them the </p><p>current situation in Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Increasing Security </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Bukhamseen said all of the clerics expressed their </p><p>gratitude to the coalition for its liberation of Iraq, but </p><p>were deeply troubled that the security situation had not </p><p>markedly improved since the officially declared end of major </p><p>combat operations.  For example, despite issuing fatwahs </p><p>calling on his followers not to commit acts of violence </p><p>against coalition forces and reminding them that they "are </p><p>not allowed to take revenge," i.e fatwahs aimed at </p><p>maintaining stability, Grand Ayatollah Sistani has found the </p><p>security situation so threatening that he has stopped </p><p>attending Friday prayers. Bukhamseen said the clerics </p><p>proposed that the provision by the coalition of forces </p><p>specifically charged with guarding religious shrines and the </p><p>lives of religious leaders would do much to restore stability </p><p>to the region. </p><p> </p><p>Remove all Ba\'athis </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In addition, the clerics were concerned that coalition </p><p>forces were installing and/or empowering local officials who </p><p>were at best, not accountable to the people, or at worst </p><p>Ba\'athi officials from the old Saddam regime.  The clerics </p><p>urged coalition forces to conduct thorough background checks </p><p>on all officials being installed and to increase the security </p><p>of the holy cities. </p><p> </p><p>Countering Satellite Stations </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Bukhamseen said Bahr Al-Oloum was distraught at the </p><p>seeming inability of the coalition to counter Arab satellite </p><p>channels, although the cleric understands that much has been </p><p>asked of the coalition in a very short period of time.  Bahr </p><p>Al-Oloum told the visitors he and his colleagues constantly </p><p>try to reinforce to their followers that the stations are </p><p>working against their interests as Iraqis, but they are </p><p>fighting an uphill battle.  Bukhamseen suggested to the </p><p>Ambassador that the USG should offer key Iraqi journalists </p><p>the opportunity to visit the U.S.  This, he said, might be an </p><p>effective way to garner their goodwill, as well as educate </p><p>them. </p><p> </p><p>Encouraging the return of the Diaspora </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Both Bukhamseen and Marafie made suggestions about </p><p>what the USG and the CPA could do to further their goals in </p><p>Iraq.  For example, they said, the goal of growing the </p><p>economy and encouraging investment in Iraq would be made much </p><p>easier if exiled Iraqis were given preferential tax treatment </p><p>to return and invest in the country.  In addition to helping </p><p>grow the economy, this would bring back many Iraqis who have </p><p>been exposed to Western ideas about justice and democracy, </p><p>which they said, are bound to rub off. </p><p> </p><p>Addressing Psychological Trauma </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Marafie said it was also important for the CPA to </p><p>begin addressing the psychological trauma of the Iraqi people </p><p>by building memorials to those who had fallen during the </p><p>Saddam Hussein era.  The Ambassador agreed this was a good </p><p>idea, and suggested that local exhibits featuring names </p><p>and/or photos of dead and/or missing loved ones would be a </p><p>good way to go about this task. </p><p> </p><p>Building economic ties through trade shows </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Bukhamseen, who already has plans to build two hotels </p><p>in Najaf and Karbala as well as a re-bar factory and a </p><p>bottling plant in Basra, and has already started distributing </p><p>boxed juices in Iraq (via his company, ABC), said that the </p><p>security sitaution in Iraq was prohibiting even small-scale </p><p>trade and barter.  He proposed that a secure exhibition space </p><p>be developed near Baghdad, where local Iraqi companies could </p><p>come to do business with Kuwaiti and American firms. </p><p>Bukhamseen said he would periodically organize armed convoys </p><p>to protect shipments of goods to the exhibition area. </p><p>Bukhamseen said the exhibition areas would serve the dual </p><p>purposes of supplying the existing huge demand in Iraq, and </p><p>allowing companies a foothold in the Iraqi market. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Both Marafie and Bukhamseen are very successful </p><p>Kuwaiti Shia businessmen with strong historical ties to the </p><p>Shia community of southern Iraq.  Marafie\'s grandfather </p><p>gilded the dome of the Imam Ali mosque, and built many other </p><p>mosques in Southern Iraq.  They are clearly well connected </p><p>and not afraid to take risks in Iraq for their own benefit </p><p>and to create employment for Iraqis.  They are exactly the </p><p>kind of entrepreneurs we should encourage to enter the Iraqi </p><p>market -- preferably with U.S. partners. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
