<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ROME 001516 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>CAIRO FOR HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICER MICHELLE DUNNE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/26/2007 </p><p>TAGS: KIRF, PHUM, KPAL, EG, IS, IT, UN </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN SCIENTOLOGIST REQUESTS (FURTHER) USG HELP </p><p>FOR TWO MEMBERS ARRESTED IN EGYPT </p><p> </p><p>REF: CAIRO 2089 </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01516  261024Z </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: LABCOUN JAMES EHRMAN.  REASON 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p>1.  (C) A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY IN </p><p>ITALY VISITED US 3/25, SEEKING FURTHER USG HELP IN BEHALF OF </p><p>TWO SCIENTOLOGY MEMBERS CURRENTLY IMPRISONED IN EGYPT.  HE </p><p>HOPED FURTHER USG HELP WOULD BE DECISIVE AND SWAY GOE </p><p>AUTHORITIES TO DEPORT THE TWO.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) FABIO AMICARELLI, PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR </p><p>SCIENTOLOGY (ITALY), VISITED EMBASSY 3/25 TO REQUEST USG HELP </p><p>ON BEHALF OF CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY MEMBERS MAHMOUD MASARWA </p><p>AND WIFE (WAFAA YASIM), ARRESTED IN CAIRO 12/24/01 (REFTEL). </p><p>ACCORDING TO AMICARELLI, MASARWA IS AN ISRAELI ARAB, MUSLIM </p><p>BY BIRTH AND SCIENTOLOGIST BY CONVICTION.  YASIM IS </p><p>PALESTINIAN AND HOLDS PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND JORDANIAN </p><p>TRAVEL DOCUMENTS.  BOTH ARE MEMBERS OF THE TEL AVIV </p><p>SCIENTOLOGY COMMUNITY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) AMICARELLI IS BASED IN MILAN.  HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH </p><p>THIS MATTER STEMS FROM HIS POSITION AS SCIENTOLOGY\'S PUBLIC </p><p>AFFAIRS DIRECTOR IN ITALY, MASARWA\'S LEGAL RESIDENCE IN MILAN </p><p>(SINCE 1999), AND MASARWA\'S EMPLOYMENT BY MILAN-BASED NEW ERA </p><p>PUBLICATIONS ITALY (PUBLISHING HOUSE LINKED TO SCIENTOLOGY). </p><p>MASARWA/YASIM WENT TO EGYPT TO PROMOTE "DIANETICS," AUTHORED </p><p>BY SCIENTOLOGY FOUNDER L.RON HUBBARD.  THE BOOK, ACCORDING TO </p><p>AMICARELLI, HAD BEEN CLEARED BY EGYPTIAN CENSORS AND IS NOT </p><p>RELIGIOUS IN NATURE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) AMICARELLI ATTRIBUTES THE ARREST TO DISINFORMATION ON </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01516  261024Z </p><p>SCIENTOLOGY EMANATING FROM GERMANY AND FRANCE WHICH, HE </p><p>SUSPECTS, PROVOKED A NERVOUS REACTION AMONG EGYPTIAN CENSORS, </p><p>WHO HAD SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT HAVING APPROVED "DIANETICS." </p><p>IT WAS NOT UNTIL THREE WEEKS AFTER THEIR ARREST THAT MASARWA </p><p>AND YASIM WERE CHARGED WITH CONTEMPT OF RELIGION.  A 60-DAY </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE HOLDING PERIOD ENDED 2/26/02, AT WHICH TIME </p><p>PROSECUTORS SOUGHT A 45-DAY EXTENSION.  THE COURT GRANTED AN </p><p>EXTENSION, BUT LIMITED IT TO 30 DAYS, I.E., A DEADLINE THAT </p><p>IS IMMINENT.  AT THE END OF THIS PERIOD, AMICARELLI SAID, </p><p>EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES WILL EITHER HAVE TO REQUEST A FURTHER </p><p>EXTENSION OF THE HOLDING PERIOD, SEND THE CASE TO TRIAL, OR </p><p>FREE (AND PRESUMABLY DEPORT) THE TWO. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) AMICARELLI SAID FOREIGN INTERVENTION HELPED BRING </p><p>THIS MATTER TO THE ATTENTION OF HIGHER GOE AUTHORITIES, FOR </p><p>WHOM IT REPRESENTS AN EMBARRASSMENT.  INFORMAL GOI INTEREST, </p><p>HE SAID, WAS PROBABLY STIMULATED BY THE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT OF </p><p>EMBASSY CAIRO HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICER MICHELLE DUNNE.  HE SAID </p><p>HE HOPED TO PROD OFFICIAL GOI INTERVENTION (BASED ON THE </p><p>EFFORTS OF AN ITALIAN PUBLISHER TO PROMOTE COMMERCIAL SALES </p><p>IN EGYPT) THAT COULD SWAY EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES TO RELEASE OR </p><p>DEPORT THE TWO WHEN THE CURRENT 30-DAY HOLDING PERIOD ENDS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT: WHILE AMICARELLI UNDERSTANDS THE USG HAS </p><p>LIMITED GROUNDS ON WHICH TO INTERVENE (AS MASARWA AND YASIM </p><p>ARE NOT AMCITS OR RESIDENT IN THE U.S., AND THEIR EMPLOYER IS </p><p>NOT AN AMERICAN FIRM), HE NEVERTHELESS ATTRIBUTES TO THE U.S. </p><p>AN INFLUENTIAL ROLE IN EGYPT THAT COULD BE DECISIVE.  (AMONG </p><p>OTHER DOCUMENTS, HE LEFT US A 2/22/02 LETTER ON THE CASE FROM </p><p>HOUSE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE MEMBER REP. BENJAMIN </p><p>GILMAN TO EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR NABIL FAHMY.)  AMICARELLI HOPED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01516  261024Z </p><p>HIS VISIT TO AMEMBASSY ROME WOULD TRIGGER A FURTHER EFFORT BY </p><p>EMBASSY CAIRO, TIMED TO COINCIDE WITH THE CURRENT 30-DAY </p><p>HOLDING PERIOD\'S EXPIRATION. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME01516 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
