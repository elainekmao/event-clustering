<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABU DHABI 002370 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR G/TIP, NEA/ARP AND NEA/RA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/17/08 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: UAEG CONSIDERING RATIFICATION OF OPTIONAL </p><p>PROTOCOLS TO RIGHTS OF CHILD CONVENTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 126276 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Acting Deputy Chief of Mission </p><p>Thomas E. Williams for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) On 17 March, Poloff delivered reftel demarche </p><p>to MFA Legal Affairs Deputy Director Yacub Al-Hosani </p><p>and encouraged the UAEG to consider ratifying the two </p><p>Optional Protocols to the Rights of the Child </p><p>Convention -- one on the involvement of children in </p><p>armed conflict, the other on the sale of children, </p><p>child prostitution and child pornography.  (Note: The </p><p>UAEG ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the </p><p>Child on 3 January 1997.  In addition, the UAEG </p><p>ratified ILO Convention 182 Concerning Worst Forms of </p><p>Child Labor on 28 June 2001.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Poloff encouraged the UAEG to ratify both </p><p>Optional Protocols, noting that UAEG ratification of </p><p>the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child </p><p>Prostitution and Child Pornography would constitute </p><p>another effort of the UAEG to monitor and combat </p><p>trafficking in persons.  Al-Hosani noted that the MFA </p><p>had recommended to the Ministry of Justice that these </p><p>two optional protocols be considered for ratification. </p><p>He continued that the UAEG was against the actions </p><p>condemned in the two Optional Protocols and indicated </p><p>that UAE law already criminalized the subject matter </p><p>of the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, </p><p>Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.  Al-Hosani </p><p>undertook to follow-up on the status of the Ministry </p><p>of Justice\'s action on the MFA\'s recommendation.  We </p><p>will forward the UAEG\'s response when received. </p><p> </p><p>ALBRIGHT </p><p></p></div>
