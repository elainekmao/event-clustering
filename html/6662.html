<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 001835 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PRM/ANE, EUR/SE AND NEA/NGA </p><p>DEPT PASS USAID FOR BHA/OFDA - WGARVELINK AND FFP </p><p>EUCOM FOR JE, JR, J5, SOJ7 AND POLAD </p><p>GENEVA FOR RMA </p><p>CENTCOM FOR J3, J5 AND POLAD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, IZ, MOPS, PREF, PREL, TU, WFP </p><p>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE:  MFA, UN AND </p><p>TURKISH RED CRESCENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1799 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Emboffs met with MFA, Turkish Red Crescent and UN </p><p>officials just before and after the start of military </p><p>operations in Iraq to gauge preparedness and review </p><p>humanitarian assistance issues.  MFA told us it is willing </p><p>to host a coordination mechanism involving the USG and UN </p><p>agencies, pending final GOT interagency approval of PRM A/S </p><p>Dewey\'s March 12 proposal.  UN agencies noted a range of </p><p>bureaucratic and other difficulties in channeling </p><p>assistance, but said that it was slowly working through </p><p>these problems with the GOT.  However, UN Turkey is </p><p>concerned about Turkish intentions to set up camps in </p><p>northern Iraq, and told us it would not provide any </p><p>assistance to the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) if it crossed </p><p>the border in violation of international mandates on </p><p>relief.  TRC\'s General Director told us the organization </p><p>was prepared to deal with flows of displaced persons and </p><p>would like to act in accordance with international- </p><p>recognized mandates in providing relief.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MFA on Coordination and NGO Registration </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Econ Counselor and Mission Disaster Relief Officer </p><p>(MDRO) met with Tunc Ugdul, MFA Deputy Director General for </p><p>International Political Organizations, and Feza Ozturk, </p><p>Head of Department and manager of the MFA Iraq Crisis </p><p>Center on March 20.  Ugdul told us that MFA is interested </p><p>in hosting an ad hoc coordination mechanism for </p><p>humanitarian assistance which would include USG civilian </p><p>and UN agency representatives, but that a final, </p><p>interagency-cleared decision is still pending.  MFA\'s does </p><p>not plan to include NGOs in the initial meetings.  Econ </p><p>Counselor clarified that the USG has not/not set up a </p><p>Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Center (HACC) in </p><p>Diyarbakir and has not taken a decision to request GOT </p><p>permission to do so.  On siting of Humanitarian Daily </p><p>Rations (HDRs), MFA expects to have a final, positive </p><p>answer for the USG shortly.  However, he asked that, in the </p><p>future, we consider purchasing locally-produced HDRs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Ozturk confirmed that the GOT is now looking at </p><p>NGO applications for registration to work in Turkey and for </p><p>transit to Iraq on an expedited basis.  He said that MFA </p><p>has received 14 applications from NGOs seeking to provide </p><p>aid in Turkey, but none from NGOs seeking to transport aid </p><p>to Iraq through Turkey.  He clarified that the latter group </p><p>would need to submit a detailed request to MFA for the </p><p>first shipment of aid to be transported.  The first </p><p>application would be reviewed carefully, but subsequent </p><p>ones could be handled quickly.  Note:  Per reftel, several </p><p>international NGOs told us they plan to apply for transit </p><p>permits, but as we understand, they have not submitted </p><p>specific requests as yet.  End Note.  In response to a </p><p>question from Econ Counselor, Ugdul stated that MFA in </p><p>principle had no problems in allowing AID DART members to </p><p>cross the Turkish - Iraqi border, but that MFA would need a </p><p>request in writing to authorize this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UN Agencies on Cooperation with the GOT </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Econ Counselor, MDRO, and DART member meet with UN </p><p>Resident Coordinator Alfredo Witschi-Cestari and </p><p>representatives of UNICEF, WFP and UNHCR on March 20. </p><p>Witschi-Cestari opined that the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) </p><p>would like to cross the border, and warned that UN agencies </p><p>would have to freeze cooperation with TRC, in a very public </p><p>way, if TRC were to set up camps in Iraq.  Under a new </p><p>agreement worth USD 150,000, UNHCR is providing relief </p><p>goods to TRC. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Security Concerns:  Witschi-Cestari indicated that </p><p>all UN international staff have been evacuated from Iraq. </p><p>Witschi-Cestari said a decision to return staff would be </p><p>based in part on USG views on the security situation and </p><p>asked Embassy personnel to share as much information as </p><p>possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Coordination with Turkish Officials:  Witschi- </p><p>Cestari and his team said that the GOT was cooperating with </p><p>UN activities, but not very efficiently.  In particular, UN </p><p>staff indicated customs and other difficulties at the port </p><p>of Mersin, at warehouses, and along the road to Silopi. </p><p>Current indications from UN staff in Silopi are that 20 to </p><p>30 trucks are crossing the border per day.  Trucks are </p><p>being completely unloaded, taking an average of 30 minutes </p><p>per truck.   UN contingency plans call for 150 to 200 WFP </p><p>trucks to cross per day, and the UN is very concerned </p><p>about the reluctance of the GOT to facilitate the customs </p><p>process at the border.  UNHCR indicated that, as recently </p><p>as March 19, UNHCR staff were unable to reach Silopi due to </p><p>Turkish checkpoints refusing to allow access to the area. </p><p>UN staff were able to cross the checkpoint several hours </p><p>later, but the situation seems to be hit or miss. </p><p>Additionally, </p><p>the UN stated that they have had difficulty in coordinating </p><p>with Turkish military officials.  Note:  In a subsequent </p><p>conversation, Witschi-Cestari told Econ Counselor that </p><p>several of these issues had been addressed by MFA.  End </p><p>Note. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) NGO Coordination:  UN remains reluctant to </p><p>coordinate NGO meetings in Turkey, because of concerns that </p><p>it may be taking responsibility for the activities of </p><p>unregistered NGOs in the country, but it is still </p><p>considering this issue.  UNHCR stated that it is willing to </p><p>help NGOs which will be implementing partners in the </p><p>registration process for work in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Coordination Mechanism:  Econ Counselor raised the </p><p>tripartite aid coordination mechanism raised by A/S Dewey </p><p>on March 12.  UN officials were receptive to the concept, </p><p>provided that the GOT were to host these meetings </p><p>and provided they did not a priori exclude other donors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish Red Crescent Says It Wants to Work Within </p><p>International Mandates </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Econ Counselor, Mission Disaster Relief Officer </p><p>(MDRO) and Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) </p><p>Leader discussed contingency planning and preparedness with </p><p>Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) Director General Fatih Evren </p><p>on March 19.  Evren told us that contrary to some press </p><p>reports, TRC had not moved into northern Iraq, nor had it </p><p>set up displaced person (DP) camps.  TRC wanted to act in </p><p>accordance with internationally-recognized mandates and </p><p>principles in providing relief, and TRC, MFA and the ICRC </p><p>are discussing the issue of mandates.  Evren added that </p><p>there had been no significant population movements toward </p><p>Turkey\'s border thus far.  He maintained that TRC had </p><p>asked for supplies from NATO, EU and UN agencies, but had </p><p>not received any assistance thus far.  Nonetheless, he </p><p>said TRC was ready to cope with a crisis.  Evren stated </p><p>that the possible use of chemical or biological weapons </p><p>in Iraq was his principal concern. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
