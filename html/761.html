BENKOVAC FELL TO HV FORCES AT 17:55 LOCAL. </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF HRVOJE SARINIC EXPRESSED </p><p>CONDITIONAL GOC INTEREST IN STOPPING ALL MILITARY </p><p>OPERATIONS AND CONDUCTING POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH SERB </p><p>INTERLOCUTORS, INCLUDING BABIC.  HE SAID THAT THE GOC </p><p>CONSIDERED SERBS ATTACKS ON DUBROVNIK AND EASTERN SLAVONIA </p><p>TO BE ONLY PROVOCATIONS, AND THAT THE HV WOULD NOT BE </p><p>DRAWN INTO OPENING ANOTHER FRONT WITH THE SERBS.  SERB </p><p>FORCES WERE PRESENTING MOST RESISTANCE IN SECTOR NORTH, </p><p>AROUND SLUNJ, AND THE HV EXPECTS TO HAVE THIS TERRITORY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02986  01 OF 05  052147Z </p><p>UNDER CONTROL WITHIN A FEW DAYS.

GENERAL CERMAK NAMED BY TUDJMAN TO BE THE </p><p>CHIEF MILITARY COMMANDER IN THE NEWLY-LIBERATED TERRITORY. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>KNIN FALLS </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  SARINIC CONFIRMED TO THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE HV NOW </p><p>HAD COMPLETE CONTROL OVER KNIN.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE KNIN </p><p>CIVIL AUTHORITIES HAD FLED THE CITY IN A PANIC AND HAD NO </p><p>TIME TO CARRY WITH THEM OR DESTROY GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS </p><p>AND RECORDS, ALTHOUGH HE SAID IT WAS TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT </p><p>REMAINED.  SERB RESISTANCE WAS STILL HOLDING OUT IN THE </p><p>TOWNS OF BENKOVAC AND OBROVAC IN WESTERN PART OF SECTOR </p><p>SOUTH.  HOWEVER, HE CONFIRMED THAT HV FORCES HAD </p><p>PENETRATED TO THE CROATIAN INTERNATIONAL BORDER AND HAD </p><p>LINKED UP WITH ABH FIFTH CORPS TROOPS AT KOSTAJNICA. </p><p>(NOTE: THE HV COMMANDER IN OGULIN SAID THAT HIS FORCES </p><p>PLANNED TO LINK UP WITH FIFTH CORPS NEAR RAKOVICA ON </p><p>AUGUST 6.)  EARLIER IN THE DAY, SARINIC SAID HE HAD </p><p>PROMISED SRSG AKASHI AND UNPF COMMANDER JANVIER THAT UNCRO </p><p>WOULD BE ALLOWED TO PATROL KNIN AND CONTINUE OPERATIONS </p><p>THERE, BUT ONLY AFTER SAFETY CONDITIONS ALLOWED UNCRO TO </p><p>RETURN.  HE INSISTED THAT IT WOULD BE PSYCHOLOGICALLY </p><p>IMPORTANT TO THE REMAINING SERBS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY TO MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN THE TOWN. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02986  01 OF 05  052147Z </p><p>THE ABDIC FACTOR </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  SARINIC CLAIMED THAT OVER SIX HUNDRED TROOPS LOYAL TO </p><p>RENEGADE MUSLIM LEADER FIKRET ABDIC HAD QUICKLY SHIFTED </p><p>LOYALTIES TO THE HV AND THE ABH 5TH CORPS AS THESE TWO </p><p>ARMIES CONSOLIDATED THEIR GAINS IN SECTOR NORTH AND THE </p><p>BIHAC POCKET.  ABDIC, SARINIC OPINED, WAS A "NORMAL GUY, </p><p>NOT A FUNDAMENTALIST," DESPITE HIS OPPORTUNISTIC </p><p>ASSOCIATION WITH MARTIC.  HE POSED NO PROBLEMS FOR THE </p><p>GOC, PER SE.  YET THE GOC COULD NOT RISK ITS RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH IZETBEGOVIC ON ABDIC\'S ACCOUNT.  HOWEVER, IN RECENT </p><p>CONVERSATIONS WITH TUDJMAN, SARINIC WAS SURPRISED THAT </p><p>IZETBEGOVIC APPEARED TO BE FLEXIBLE CONCERNING ABDIC. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>UNCRO TROOP PRESENCE AND CASUALTIES </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  SARINIC COULD NOT CONFIRM THE CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>SURROUNDING THE DEATHS OF TWO CZECH UNMOS EARLIER TODAY. </p><p>HE HAD HIMSELF ONLY LEARNED THE NEWS FROM AKASHI A FEW </p><p>HOURS EARLIER.  REGARDING THE DANISH UNMO KIA, SARINIC </p><p>SAID HE HAD CREDIBLE, THOUGH UNCONFIRMED, INFORMATION THAT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ5451 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5451 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02986  02 OF 05  052148Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  A-00     CA-02    CCO-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  CTME-00  OASY-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-01    FBIE-00 </p><p>      FBO-01   H-01     IMMC-01  TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-06    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-01     ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00  OCS-03   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPR-01   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01     SCT-00   SP-00 </p><p>      SSO-00   SS-00    STR-01   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  USSS-00 </p><p>      ASDS-01  SNIS-00  NISC-01  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRME-01  PRMC-01 </p><p>      DRL-09   G-00       /040W </p><p>                  ------------------E0A550  052148Z /38 </p><p>O 052234Z AUG 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6761 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J-5PMA/J21// </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>COMSIXTHFLT //N2// </p><p>USCINCEUR VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5/ECPOLAD// </p><p>JAC MOLESWORTH RAF MOLESWORTH UK </p><p>CINCUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5/POLAD// </p><p>CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XOX/IN/POLAD// </p><p>DIA WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02986  02 OF 05  052148Z </p><p>AMCONSUL MUNICH </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 05 ZAGREB 002986 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRUSSELS ALSO FOR USEU </p><p>USVIENNA ALSO FOR USDEL CSCE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 8/5/00 </p><p>TAGS:  MOPS PHUM PREL PGOV HR BK UN </p><p>SUBJECT:  CROATIA SITREP NO. 9 - AUGUST 5, 2130 HRS LOCAL </p><p> </p><p>THE DANE HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY THE SERBS AND THE HV HAD </p><p>FOUND HIM WITH HIS HANDS TIED WITH WIRE.  TH </p><p>E "ARSK" HAD </p><p>USED HIM AS A HUMAN SHIELD DURING THE HV ATTACK ON THEM. </p><p>SARINIC SAID THE DANE HAD DIED DURING THE RESCUE FLIGHT </p><p>BACK TO THE MASH AT PLESO AIRPORT IN ZAGREB.  A POLISH </p><p>UNMO (KOVALESKY - NFI) HAD DIED IN SERB-HELD TERRITORY, </p><p>SARINIC SAID, BECAUSE THE SERBS HAD REFUSED TO ALLOW HIM </p><p>ON A UN HELICOPTER TO PLESO THAT THE UN HAD ARRANGED AND </p><p>CLEARED WITH THE CROATS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AMBASSADOR GALBRAITH UNDERSCORED THAT THE SECURITY OF </p><p>UN FORCES WAS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY.  HV FORCES MUST GO AROUND UN OBSERVATION POSTS </p><p>(UNOPS), HE SAID, NOT THROUGH THEM.  SARINIC RESPONDED </p><p>THAT AKASHI AND JANVIER HAD ASKED THAT UN COMPOUNDS NOT BE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02986  02 OF 05  052148Z </p><p>VIOLATED.  THESE COMPOUNDS NOW HELD FOUR HUNDRED UN </p><p>PERSONNEL AND THREE HUNDRED SERBS SEEKING REFUGE.  THESE </p><p>SERBS WOULD BE FREE TO REMAIN IN CROATIA OR LEAVE FOR </p><p>SERB-HELD B-H IF THEY SO WISHED.  THE CROATIAN AMNESTY LAW </p><p>WOULD APPLY TO ALL WHO STAYED EXCEPT THOSE "SPECIAL CASES" </p><p>GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES, HE ASSERTED.  THE UN WOULD BE </p><p>ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ITS WORK IN KNIN, HE CONTINUED, AS </p><p>SOON AS THE SECURITY RISK SITUATION ALLOWED THEM TO DO SO. </p><p>KNIN WAS CURRENTLY UNDER A GENERAL AIR SIREN WARNING, HE </p><p>SAID, BECAUSE SINCE 1430 LOCAL TIME, IT WAS BEING SHELLED </p><p>FROM OBROVAC AND BENKOVAC. </p><p> </p><p>7.  SARINIC INSISTED THAT NOT A SINGLE HV SHELL HAD HIT </p><p>THE KNIN UN COMPOUND.  IT WAS LOCATED OUT OF TOWN, AND THE </p><p>HV FORCES HAD STRICT INSTRUCTIONS NOT TO TOUCH IT.  HE </p><p>SAID ONE SHELL HAD FALLEN IN FRONT OF THE COMPOUND </p><p>ENTRANCE.  CONFLICTING INFORMATION CONTINUED TO ARRIVE </p><p>CONCERNING THE SITUATION INSIDE KNIN.  IN SARINIC\'S TALKS </p><p>WITH THE UNPF LEADERS, GENERAL JANVIER HAD SAID THAT </p><p>BODIES HAD LINED THE STREETS OF KNIN, YET AKASHI HAD </p><p>CLAIMED THAT THERE WERE ONLY A FEW CASUALTIES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>CONTINUED MILITARY ACTIVITY </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE SERBS CONTINUED TO MOUNT THE STRONGEST RESISTANCE </p><p>IN SECTOR NORTH, HE SAID, BETWEEN GLINA AND PETRINJA.  HE </p><p>EXPECTED OPERATIONS THERE TO CONTINUE ANOTHER 24-48 HOURS. </p><p>ONE DOZEN TANKS STILL HELD OUT IN THE AREA.  THEY WERE </p><p>UNABLE TO MOVE DUE TO MECHANICAL FAILURES, YET THEIR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02986  02 OF 05  052148Z </p><p>CANNONS STILL FUNCTIONED WELL.  TWO HV INFANTRY ATTACKS </p><p>HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL AT TAKING THEM OUT, SO THE ARMY HAD </p><p>SURROUNDED THE TANKS AND WOULD NOT RISK FURTHER INFANTRY </p><p>CASUALTIES. </p><p> </p><p>9.  AKASHI AND JANVIER HAD PROPOSED TO SARINIC A CESSATION </p><p>OF HOSTILITIES AND WOULD PRESENT A PAPER TO SARINIC LATER </p><p>THIS EVENING AT 1800.  SARINIC SAID THE GOC WOULD ONLY </p><p>ACCEPT PROPOSALS THAT INCLUDED THE COMPLETE SURRENDER AND </p><p>DISARMAMENT OF RSK FORCES IN BOTH THE SECTORS.

HOWEVER, HE MAINTAINED THAT THE </p><p>GOC WOULD ONLY AGREE TO NEGOTIATE WITH BABIC AS LONG AS </p><p>FIGHTING STILL CONTINUED.  SHOULD THE "ARSK" NOT SURRENDER </p><p>AND THE HV TAKE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE TERRITORY </p><p>MILITARILY, NEGOTIATIONS WITH BABIC WOULD NO LONGER BE AN </p><p>OPTION.

BABIC HAD TO BE CONTACTED THAT SAME EVENING ABOUT </p><p>CEASEFIRE NEGOTIATIONS, SARINIC INSISTED, FOR THIS IDEA TO </p><p>BE AT ALL SUCCESSFUL.  THE AMBASSADOR AGREED TO BE THE </p><p>POINT OF INITIAL CONTACT WITH BABIC, AND WOULD PLAY AN </p><p>ADDITIONAL ROLE AS REQUESTED BY THE PARTIES, SUBJECT TO </p><p>WASHINGTON\'S APPROVAL.

SARINIC WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT </p><p>BABIC\'S ABILITY TO DELIVER ON THE MILITARY FRONT, BUT </p><p>AGREED.  THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED THAT SUCH A SETTLEMENT </p><p>MUST MAKE LOCAL SERBS FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN THEIR </p><p>CHOICE TO REMAIN IN KRAJINA.  BABIC WAS AN IDEAL </p><p>INTERLOCUTOR BECAUSE HE HAD POPULAR SUPPORT AMONG THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF KRAJINA.  THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS ESSENTIAL IN GAINING THE </p><p>CONFIDENCE OF THE LOCAL SERBIAN POPULATION.  A POSITIVE </p><p>RESOLUTION IN THE KRAJINA ALSO HELD SIGNIFICANT </p><p>IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN SECTOR EAST. </p><p> </p><p>12.  SARINIC REPLIED THAT CROATIA WOULD BE PREPARED TO </p><p>DISCUSS ISSUES OF CIVILIAN AUTHORITY AND CULTURAL </p><p>AUTONOMY, AS WELL AS COUNTY TERRITORIAL BOUNDARIES.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT DISCUSSIONS WITH BABIC BE HELD </p><p>IN ZAGREB AT A LOCATION OF THE GOC\'S CHOOSING, PREFERABLY </p><p>NOT IN SECRET.  HE SUGGESTED OTHER INTERLOCUTORS THE GOC </p><p>MIGHT WISH TO CONSIDER MIGHT BE VOJNOVIC, AND RADOVAN </p><p>JOVIC, A RECENT USIS IV RECIPIENT.  SARINIC URGED THAT </p><p>SUCH DISCUSSION START IMMEDIATELY.  AS SOON AS MILITARY </p><p>ACTION FINISHED, CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE KRAJINA WOULD </p><p>CHANGE, AND HE WOULD NO LONGER BE AMENABLE TO HOLDING </p><p>DISCUSSIONS WITH BABIC. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>KRAJINA MUST RETAIN A SERBIAN POPULATION </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13.

AT A TELEVISED MOD PRESS CONFERENCE AT 1800 LOCAL, </p><p>THE SPOKESMAN, GENERAL IVAN TOLJ, CONFIRMED THAT BENKOVAC </p><p>HAD FALLEN AT 17:55.  HE SAID THE HV OPERATION WAS </p><p>PROCEEDING TWICE AS FAST AS THEY HAD EXPECTED AND THAT </p><p>EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE TASK HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.   THE HV </p><p>HAD CUT SEVERAL SERB COMMUNICATION LINES (DRNIS-KNIN, </p><p>OBROVAC-GRACAC, GOSPIC-LJUBOVO, GOSPIC-GRACAC, AND DUBICA- </p><p>KOSTAJNICA).  THE HV HAD ENGAGED THE FORCES OF THE 7TH </p><p>KNIN CORPS (10,000 TROOPS) AND 15TH ILJICKI CORPS (15,000 </p><p>TROOPS) IN THE SOUTH, AND THE 21ST AND 39TH CORPS IN THE </p><p>NORTH.  TOLJ OPINED THAT "TODAY WAS AN HISTORICAL DAY FOR </p><p>CROATIA, EUROPE AND THE WORLD." </p><p> </p><p>19.  REFUSING TO GIVE NUMBERS, TOLJ INSISTED THAT THE HV </p><p>HAD SUFFERED MINIMAL CASUALTIES, AND DID NOT HAVE </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY SERB TROOPS HAD FLED TO BOSNIA. </p><p>THE HV COMMANDER IN OGULIN TOLD POLOFF AND DATT THAT 40 </p><p>PERCENT OF HIS CASUALTIES WERE CAUSED BY MINEFIELDS.  HE </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT SERB GUERRILLA ACTIONS CONTINUED IN THE </p><p>SLUNJ AREA OF SECTOR NORTH, BUT INSISTED THAT THE HV WAS </p><p>UNCONCERNED THAT THE "ARSK" AND THE BSA MIGHT LAUNCH A </p><p>COUNTER-OFFENSIVE FROM BOSNIA IN THE COMING DAYS.
