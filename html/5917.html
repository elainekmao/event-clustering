ETHIOPIA HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN SUB-SAHARAN </p><p>AFRICA AND AN ANNUAL PER CAPITA INCOME OF ONLY U.S. 100 </p><p>DOLLARS. THE COUNTRY IS ONCE AGAIN FACED WITH THE THREAT OF </p><p>FAMINE.

SECURING A SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY OF FOOD FOR ITS PEOPLE HAS </p><p>BEEN A PRIORITY OF THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT AND DONORS FOR </p><p>20 YEARS. IN SPITE OF GOOD EFFORTS, FOOD INSECURITY REMAINS </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S MOST DEEP-ROOTED PROBLEM. THE CATASTROPHIC </p><p>FAMINE OF 1984-85 WAS FOLLOWED BY SERIOUS FOOD SHORTAGES IN </p><p>1992, 1994, 2000 AND 2002. (THERE HAVE BEEN 15 DROUGHTS </p><p>SINCE 1965.)
