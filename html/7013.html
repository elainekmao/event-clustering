<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 002480 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KRIM, SNAR, CA, Crime </p><p>SUBJECT: ORGANIZED CRIME CONTINUES TO THRIVE IN CANADA </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: In its latest report on organized crime </p><p>activity, Criminal Intelligence Service Canada indicates that </p><p>organized criminal groups in Canada are increasingly </p><p>utilizing emerging technology to commit crimes such as fraud </p><p>and money laundering, and that they are extensively involved </p><p>in the large-scale cultivation and trafficking of </p><p>residentially-grown marijuana. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Criminal Intelligence Service Canada collects </p><p>intelligence and raw data from the criminal intelligence </p><p>units of law enforcement agencies across Canada. The staff of </p><p>the Central Bureau of CISC is located in Ottawa, and is made </p><p>up of employees of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and </p><p>personnel detailed from other police departments and </p><p>government agencies.  CISC prepares and publishes an annual </p><p>report on organized crime in Canada; the most recent report, </p><p>covering activity through May 16, 2003, was released August </p><p>25. The report presents an overview of the current activities </p><p>of five broad organized crime groups in Canada: Aboriginal </p><p>based, Asian based, Eastern European-based, outlaw motorcycle </p><p>gangs, and Traditional (Italian-based). Organized crime at </p><p>Canada\'s marine ports, in which all of the major crime groups </p><p>are involved, is discussed. The report also evaluates trends </p><p>in certain criminal activities in Canada:  contraband tobacco </p><p>and alcohol, organized crime and the diamond industry, the </p><p>illicit movement of firearms, technology and crime, the </p><p>sexual exploitation of children, and street gangs. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The report describes some victories by law </p><p>enforcement, including operations targeting outlaw motorcycle </p><p>gangs and narcotics seizures at the Port of Halifax. But the </p><p>report makes it clear that organized criminal activity </p><p>continues throughout Canada, and that organized criminal </p><p>groups are constantly seizing on new targets of opportunity </p><p>and branching into new criminal ventures. While the Canadian </p><p>press has reported that organized crime is on the rise in </p><p>Canada, Shawn Scromeda, counsel in Justice Canada\'s Criminal </p><p>Law Policy Section who works on organized crime issues, </p><p>described that view as "alarmist." Scromeda told poloff that </p><p>Canada lacks baseline indicators with which to measure </p><p>whether organized crime is increasing or decreasing, and said </p><p>the CISC report is intended to serve as a "snapshot" of </p><p>current organized crime activity. Scromeda noted that the </p><p>Canadian Parliament approved several significant amendments </p><p>to the criminal code in December 2001 which target organized </p><p>crime, and he believes the impact of these amendments is just </p><p>beginning to be felt. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The complete text of the 2003 Annual Report on </p><p>Organized Crime in Canada can be found at the following </p><p>internet address:  www.cisc.gc.ca. </p><p> </p><p>Visit Canada\'s Classified Web Site at </p><p>http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/wha/ottawa </p><p> </p><p>KELLY </p><p></p></div>
