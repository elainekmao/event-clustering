<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001285 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/27/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  BUHARI STILL STANDING </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter.  Reasons:  1.5 (B </p><p>& D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  Poloff met General Muhammadu Buhari, </p><p>ANPP presidential candidate, to discuss his assessment of </p><p>Nigeria and his future plans.  Buhari commented that he had </p><p>no faith in Obasanjo because the "four failed years has </p><p>only emboldened him."  Buhari criticized the electoral </p><p>tribunals for lack of fairness and warned that Nigeria\'s </p><p>relative quiet did not signify acquiescence, but rather it </p><p>was the silence that often comes before something dramatic </p><p>happens.  He asserted that the ongoing arrests of </p><p>opposition activists and the continued shortfalls of </p><p>funding for the military would create more tension and </p><p>uncertainty.  While appearing tired, he did not seem </p><p>frustrated.  Rather, he seemed impatient, as if he was </p><p>merely marking time until a political opening was </p><p>presented. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ON OBASANJO </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Buhari remains critical of President Obasanjo and </p><p>his government.  He complained about increasing corruption </p><p>and groused that the Administration\'s privatization efforts </p><p>only transferred national assets into the hands of regime </p><p>insiders.  He alleged that this rising corruption and </p><p>nepotistic privatization were indicative of "Obasanjo\'s </p><p>legacy of failure."  Commenting that the previous four </p><p>years has only emboldened Obasanjo, Buhari pointed to the </p><p>widespread irregularities of the 2003 elections and the use </p><p>of security services to ensure a "mandate for continuity" </p><p>as Obasanjo\'s only success.  He said that Obasanjo\'s style </p><p>of governance continues to alienate people throughout the </p><p>country.  While raising expectations that he would appoint </p><p>a stellar, reformist cabinet, Obasanjo\'s Ministerial </p><p>selections are a combination of recycled failures and </p><p>nobodies, Buhari remarked.  He predicted that corruption </p><p>and mismanagement will continue unabated, and, if Obasanjo </p><p>lasts a whole term, will culminate in elections in 2007 </p><p>"even worse than 2003." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ON TRIBUNALS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Buhari stated flatly that the tribunals were a </p><p>waste, but said that he had promised to seek redress </p><p>through the tribunals and would see this pledge through </p><p>because "I am a man of my word."  He said that he only </p><p>committed to go along with the process for appearances </p><p>sake.  Buhari claimed the majority of cases were thrown out </p><p>for "technical" reasons and said "everyone knows" the </p><p>judges were bribed and coerced to maintain the status quo. </p><p>When asked about his prospects, Buhari stated that he </p><p>expected little from the Federal Court of Appeals (which </p><p>sits as the initial Presidential Tribunal), but would </p><p>follow the process through to the Supreme Court.  When </p><p>asked what he expected from highest court, Buhari </p><p>responded, "I know (Chief Justice) Uwais and he will behave </p><p>honorably." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ON SECURITY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Buhari lamented Nigeria\'s continued insecurity, </p><p>claiming "more people have been killed under this regime </p><p>than under Abacha."  He alleged the detention of thousands </p><p>of political activists, saying this was a symptom of </p><p>Obasanjo\'s intellectual and moral bankruptcy.  He remained </p><p>concerned that the potential for violence is great </p><p>throughout Nigeria.  He claimed that people throughout the </p><p>country are frustrated and angry and are agitating to </p><p>attack the "so-called legitimacy" of this regime.  Buhari </p><p>said that if Obasanjo was aware of the "lengths we are </p><p>going to in ensuring calm," he would be frightened by the </p><p>potential for upheaval."  "Quiet is not acquiescence; the </p><p>tendency is to take the fight to the streets," he averred. </p><p>Buhari was also concerned that the military is demoralized </p><p>and has been woefully underfunded.   As an institution, the </p><p>military has been in a state of decline throughout </p><p>Obasanjo\'s term and its members are suffering </p><p>disproportionately to the rest of society, Buhari claimed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Buhari, far from frustrated, seemed a man who is </p><p>confident that he will continue to play a large role in </p><p>national politics and that it will not exclusively be as an </p><p>opposition figure.  He continues to attract large crowds to </p><p>many places he travels and enjoys the limelight.  While </p><p>keeping his own plans close to his chest, he did appear </p><p>impatient with having to go through the electoral tribunal </p><p>process which he labeled ineffective.  It remains ironic </p><p>that among the former coupists claiming to be born-again </p><p>democrats, Buhari\'s claims of reform have strengthened and </p><p>he is increasingly viewed by the public as the (self- </p><p>proclaimed) leading political opposition figure and, most </p><p>strongly in the North, a primary defender of democracy and </p><p>electoral fairness. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
