<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001188 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>ENERGY FOR SCHEINMAN </p><p>VIENNA FOR GOLDMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:N/A </p><p>TAGS: KNNP, PARM, PTER, SENV, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION SEEKS U.S. ASSISTANCE </p><p>FOR RADIATION PORTALS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary. In a 20 February meeting, Jordan Atomic Energy </p><p>Commission DG Kodah made a strong pitch for U.S. technical and </p><p>financial assistance in the operation of Jordan\'s five radiation </p><p>portals.  In addition, Kodah is keen for his staff to participate </p><p>in upcoming EXBS training on export controls and identification </p><p>of possible dual-use items transiting Jordan.  The DG bemoaned </p><p>his agency\'s lack of funding and the insufficient staff to man </p><p>the portals effectively.  While he greatly appreciated IAEA </p><p>support, including the recent furnishing of two additional </p><p>portals and training, Kodah suggested that an annual $140,000 </p><p>commitment is needed to get all Jordanian portals up and running </p><p>in an efficient manner.  That said, no official cooperative </p><p>mechanism currently exists among the JAEC, customs, and </p><p>intelligence services to ensure proper coordination at Jordan\'s </p><p>borders.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) In a call by Econ Counselor and NEA Regional Environment </p><p>Officer on the Director General of the Jordan Atomic Energy </p><p>Commission (JAEC), Dr. Ziad Kodah, we heard a refrain of his </p><p>September 2002 plea to visiting DOE, Customs, and State </p><p>Department non-proliferation officials:  His fledgling </p><p>independent agency has insufficient resources--financial, </p><p>technical, and human--to effectively monitor the transit of </p><p>radioactive material through Jordan.  Kodah explained that the </p><p>JAEC was responsible for the five portals in the country; two had </p><p>just been received from the IAEA and are scheduled to be </p><p>"operational" sometime in March.  The challenge, he explained, is </p><p>the JAEC\'s manpower shortage, a function of its small size, </p><p>relative youth, and inability to eke out a larger budget from an </p><p>already strapped government. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Kodah defined the JAEC portal mission as one originally </p><p>keyed to identifying imported radioactive material; however, that </p><p>is expected to evolve to also include exported and smuggled </p><p>material.  JAEC only received the mandate to operate these </p><p>radiation detection units in August 2002.  Despite the inability </p><p>of the JAEC to adequately staff its current five portals, he </p><p>lamented the fact that the number Jordan has is probably </p><p>insufficient to do the job.  With eight official ports of entry, </p><p>the five clearly cannot cope with all of the traffic, Kodah </p><p>added.  To combat this shortfall, Jordan has chosen to deploy the </p><p>portals in the following priority manner:  of the three purchased </p><p>by the JAEC (Canadian manufactured "Exploronium" gamma-only </p><p>variety), one each is stationed at the Jaber border with Syria, </p><p>the Iraqi border, and Sheikh Hussein Bridge border with Israel; </p><p>the two recent IAEA machines (Yantar II variety) are deployed at </p><p>Aqaba port and the Iraqi border. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) At the Iraqi border, the portal has only been </p><p>operational for the past four months after the unit was </p><p>redeployed from the Israel/Sheikh Hussein Bridge.  General </p><p>Intelligence Directorate (GID) officers, who, Kodah believed, are </p><p>insufficiently trained in its operation, man it.  Also, Kodah </p><p>admitted that the unit is exclusively looking at material </p><p>imported to Jordan.  No checks of material departing the country </p><p>are currently being conducted using the portals.  As Kodah </p><p>commented, "we\'ve been working on the assumption that there is no </p><p>unaccounted for radioactive material in Jordan, so we\'re only </p><p>interested in that which is being smuggled into the country." </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) When asked if there was close coordination among the </p><p>JAEC, Jordanian intelligence services and customs authorities, </p><p>Kodah regretted that there was "no official cooperation" and no </p><p>committee to jointly discuss issues of cross-cutting concern.  He </p><p>explained that the current system allowed for customs officers to </p><p>identify a suspect shipment, alert the GID, which in turn sends </p><p>the material in question to JAEC labs.  Kodah was confident of </p><p>his staff\'s abilities to correctly identify the material. </p><p>Although he had no idea of the percentage of traffic searched, he </p><p>was able to share with us that about 300 "hits" had occurred that </p><p>warranted further investigation and testing.  Most, he confided, </p><p>were of a "natural radioactivity," such as in sulfur or cuprite </p><p>shipments, as well as individuals who were taking iodine for </p><p>thyroid therapy.  While the lab tests are ongoing, as a </p><p>regulatory agency JAEC has the legal ability to detain </p><p>questionable vehicles. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) During the course of our conversation, Kodah returned </p><p>often to what was obviously troubling him about JAEC--its </p><p>shortage of manpower and funding.  Without these two critical </p><p>elements sufficiently addressed, he argued, the JAEC didn\'t have </p><p>the tools to implement its mission.  Kodah estimates that about </p><p>35 new personnel, at an annual cost of about $140,000, would be </p><p>needed to fully staff all of the portals.  In addition, he added </p><p>to his wish list mobile labs to test suspect material quickly on- </p><p>site. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Background on the JAEC:  The JAEC, established in </p><p>September 2001, is an outgrowth of the Ministry of Energy.  It is </p><p>an independent regulatory agency with a staff of about 50, five </p><p>of whom have nuclear engineering degrees.  The JAEC currently </p><p>comprises five departments--licensing and inspection, calibration </p><p>and radiation protection, nuclear applications and research, </p><p>administration and finance, and international cooperation and </p><p>public information.  A sixth department will be formed once the </p><p>calibration element is broken out of its current configuration. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
