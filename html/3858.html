<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 005653 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR JANEAN MANN AND ANTONIA CHAMBERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, ASEC, KCRM, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: FTOS: QUARTERLY REVIEW </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 179250 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Per reftel, a number of foreign terrorist </p><p>organizations (FTOs)--mostly Palestinian rejectionist </p><p>groups--maintain a clandestine presence in Jordan.  Those </p><p>that qualify under the FTO status are HAMAS, PFLP, PFLP-GC, </p><p>PIJ, Abu Nidal, and Hizballah.  Although DFLP no longer </p><p>qualifies as an FTO, they too maintain a presence in Jordan. </p><p>To our knowledge, these groups are not currently involved in </p><p>targeting U.S. or Jordanian interests, but use Jordan as a </p><p>base for propaganda, fund-raising, and political purposes. </p><p>These groups probably also provide some support </p><p>infrastructure--including weapons smuggling--for anti-Israeli </p><p>operations inside Israel and the West Bank. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) We believe al-Qa\'ida also has a presence in Jordan. </p><p>Two cells affiliated with the al-Qaida organization were </p><p>arrested in 1999 for plotting to carryout attacks against </p><p>hotels catering to Westerners and at Christian religious </p><p>sites within Jordan.  A recent thread of reporting indicating </p><p>that al-Qa\'ida members may have planned to conduct kidnapping </p><p>operations against American businessmen in Jordan suggests </p><p>al-Qa\'ida continues to consider Jordan as a platform for its </p><p>anti-American operations. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) There are also a unknown number of Islamic extremists </p><p>in Jordan who sympathize with Bin Ladin\'s anti-American </p><p>message or related extremist idelogies.  Jordanian officials </p><p>recently arrested a number of these sympathizers who may have </p><p>been planning to target Americans in West Amman, the area </p><p>where the U.S. Embassy is located.  We continue to monitor </p><p>these Islamists to see if they coalesce into an organized </p><p>group that would qualify as an FTO. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The GOJ continues to aggressively pursue </p><p>counterterrorist operations against all these groups.  The </p><p>GOJ also vigilantly patrols their borders and has </p><p>successfully disrupted several attempts to smuggle personnel </p><p>and weapons to Palestinian rejectionist groups in Israel and </p><p>the West Bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
