<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 002235 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CAN, WHA/PDA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE PASS NSC/WEUROPE; NSC/WHA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, KMDR, OPRC, CA, TFUS01, TFUS02, TFUS03,  OIIP </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: MIDDLE EAST; IRAQ; </p><p>          AFGHANISTAN; TERRORISM </p><p> </p><p>MIDDLE EAST </p><p>1.   "Stumbling block on road to peace" </p><p>The liberal Toronto Star opined (8/5): "...Bush has </p><p>been pressing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to </p><p>divert the path of the barrier so it consumes less West </p><p>Bank territory. But Sharon last week dismissed Bush\'s </p><p>request to dismantle or move the fence.... Israel has </p><p>every right to build a security fence, or wall, along </p><p>its borders. Many countries have such barriers. The </p><p>U.S. has built high-tech fences, complete with barbed </p><p>wire, along much of its border with Mexico. Washington </p><p>even flirted with the idea of a similar security fence </p><p>along parts of its border with Canada after the World </p><p>Trade Center terrorist attack. But it is a mistake to </p><p>build the fence on land that might become part of a </p><p>separate Palestinian state, or be controlled by </p><p>Palestinians, if the current Mideast peace process is </p><p>successful. Sharon </p><p>knows the fence won\'t stop terrorists determined to </p><p>attack Israel.... However, Bush must continue to </p><p>pressure Sharon to dismantle the fence. At the least, </p><p>the U.S. president must demand it follow the Green </p><p>Line. Sharon needs to be told firmly that he cannot </p><p>indirectly annex parts of the West Bank. To do so will </p><p>damage this oh-so-fragile peace process." </p><p> </p><p>IRAQ </p><p>2.   "U.S. wants Saddam, but dead - not alive" </p><p>Contributing foreign editor Eric Margolis wrote in the </p><p>conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (8/3): "...Chances are </p><p>Saddam, like his sons, will be killed in a Bonnie and </p><p>Clyde-style shootout. He is unlikely to be captured, </p><p>unless incapacitated. The Bush administration will be </p><p>delighted not to put Saddam on public trial. Dead </p><p>dictators tell no tales.... Saddam should be handed </p><p>over by the U.S. to the UN War Crimes Tribunal in The </p><p>Hague that is trying Serbia\'s Slobodan Milosevic and </p><p>other accused Balkan war criminals. After all, it was </p><p>Washington that engineered Milosevic\'s delivery to The </p><p>Hague, an act for which the U.S. deserves high praise. </p><p>What applies to Milosevic applies equally to Saddam </p><p>Hussein. In fact, it would be better for the Iraqi </p><p>leader to stand trial at the newly constituted </p><p>International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. But the </p><p>Bush administration, in one of its most </p><p>shameful acts, has refused to join this tribunal or co- </p><p>operate with it. Should Saddam be gunned down, like his </p><p>two sons, there will be glee among many Americans and </p><p>rejoicing in the White House. But Saddam Hussein is not </p><p>John Dillinger or a prize elk. However odious, he was </p><p>the leader of a sovereign nation and a government </p><p>recognized by the U.S. Killing foreign </p><p>heads of state violates international law and the </p><p>directives made by three American presidents.... </p><p>America, the world\'s greatest democracy, has no </p><p>business murdering foreign leaders. Such behaviour is </p><p>criminal, immoral, undemocratic and reeks of the law of </p><p>the jungle. Past U.S. attempts to murder foreign </p><p>leaders have proved self-defeating.... George Bush may </p><p>yearn to drape the body of Saddam over his Jeep and </p><p>show it off to the folks around Crawford, Texas, but he </p><p>should be forcefully reminded that the president </p><p>represents the laws of the land. Bad enough the White </p><p>House waged a totally unnecessary, unprovoked, </p><p>undeclared war on Iraq based on spurious charges. This </p><p>egregious offence should not be compounded by cold- </p><p>blooded murder, no matter how odious the intended </p><p>victim." </p><p> </p><p>AFGHANISTAN </p><p>3.   "The Afghan trenches" </p><p>Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le </p><p>Devoir (8/4): "The UN report on Afghanistan says the </p><p>present climate of danger is seriously threatening the </p><p>peace process.... [Afghanistan] is a general state of </p><p>chaos accompanied by an increase in violence.... The </p><p>vast and essential demining program has been suspended </p><p>in more than ten provinces.... The burka is now almost </p><p>as visible as in the days of the Taliban. Women in fear </p><p>of men remain basically prisoners in their own </p><p>homes.... This general degradation is due to two </p><p>political factors: The first is that the foreign </p><p>countries involves, mainly the U.S. and Europe hesitate </p><p>to order additional deployment of troops.... The </p><p>other...is Iraq. Several American analysts have stated </p><p>that the preparation of the war in Iraq guaranteed that </p><p>the Afghan file would be relegated to the background by </p><p>the Bush administration." </p><p> </p><p>TERRORISM </p><p>4.   "Bush\'s Cassandras" </p><p>Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le </p><p>Devoir (8/5): "President Bush does not want to </p><p>declassify that famous chapter the senators wrote on </p><p>Saudi Arabia despite the demands of these senators and </p><p>the Saudi Government itself. According to information </p><p>revealed by elected officials who worked on the report, </p><p>Saudi agents informed their government about the </p><p>intentions of the perpetrators of September 11.  If the </p><p>Saudi government is so intent on having the chapter </p><p>concerning itself made public, why is Bush refusing? Is </p><p>it to protect the CIA and the FBI. Is it not to hurt </p><p>some Saudi sensitivities.... While we wait for an end </p><p>to this confusion...we can only observe that the war </p><p>against Iraq has indeed slowed down the war on </p><p>terrorism on its most delicate front: the reform of the </p><p>intelligence services." </p><p> </p><p>5.   "U.S. must take hard look at Saudi alliance" </p><p>The conservative Montreal Gazette opined (8/6): "The </p><p>American reluctance to confront its relationship with </p><p>this quaintly pathological kingdom is perhaps </p><p>understandable. Through the vicissitudes of Mideast </p><p>power politics, the Saudis have been one of the few </p><p>constants, a reliable if eccentric ally and a </p><p>dependable source of crude oil. But the time has come </p><p>for the U.S. to start at least questioning its links to </p><p>the world\'s most medieval monarchy. Releasing those 28 </p><p>pages would make a good start." </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
