<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 TEGUCIGALPA 003418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR EB/TPP/MTA/MST </p><p>USTR FOR GBLUE </p><p>GENEVA FOR USTR </p><p>GUATEMALA FOR COMMATT:DTHOMPSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, EFIN, ECON, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAS NATIONAL TRADE ESTIMATE REPORT 2003 </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 225281 </p><p> </p><p>1.  The text of the 2003 National Trade Estimate report for </p><p>Honduras follows. </p><p> </p><p>TRADE SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (Note that the following paragraph to be updated by </p><p>Washington with USDOC statistics).  In 2001, the U.S. trade </p><p>deficit with Honduras was $690 million, an increase of $183 </p><p>million from the U.S. trade deficit of $506 million in 2000. </p><p>U.S. goods exports to Honduras were $2.4 billion, a decrease of </p><p>$147 million (5.7 percent) from the level of U.S. exports to </p><p>Honduras in 2000.  Honduras was the United States\' 40th largest </p><p>export market in 2001.  U.S. imports from Honduras were $3.1 </p><p>billion in 2001, an increase of $36 million (1.2 percent) from </p><p>the level of imports in 2000. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (We also understand that this paragraph will also be updated </p><p>with USDOC statistics).  The stock of U.S. foreign direct </p><p>investment (FDI) in Honduras in 2000 amounted to $115 million, a </p><p>decrease of 8.7 percent from the level of U.S. FDI in 1999.  U.S. </p><p>FDI is concentrated largely in the manufacturing sector. </p><p> </p><p>IMPORT POLICIES </p><p> </p><p>Tariffs </p><p> </p><p>4.  In 1995, Honduras and other members of the Central American </p><p>Common Market (CACM) agreed to reduce and harmonize the common </p><p>external tariff (CET) at zero to 15 percent, but allowed each </p><p>member to determine the timing of the reductions.  Honduras has </p><p>reduced its tariffs to one percent on capital goods, medicines, </p><p>agricultural inputs, and raw materials for those imports produced </p><p>outside of the CACM.  Tariffs on non-CACM final goods were </p><p>reduced to 16 percent on December 31, 2000.  Honduras intends to </p><p>reduce its non-CACM external tariffs for other goods </p><p>(intermediate and finished) over the next several years to </p><p>between 10 percent and 15 percent.  Per the tax reform law of </p><p>June 2002, import tariffs on cars were reduced from 40 percent to </p><p>15 percent ad valorem.  Vehicles older than seven years are no </p><p>longer allowed entry to Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>Non-tariff Measures </p><p> </p><p>5.  Honduras was obligated to implement the WTO Customs Valuation </p><p>Agreement on January 1, 2000.  WTO records show that Honduras has </p><p>not yet notified its legislation nor the Customs Valuation </p><p>Checklist to the WTO Committee on Customs Valuation.  In November </p><p>1999, the WTO Committee on Customs Valuation granted Honduras\' </p><p>request to use minimum values for certain used clothing products </p><p>until January 1, 2002, and for certain tires, appliances, and </p><p>used vehicles until January 2, 2003. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Honduras implements a price band mechanism for imports of </p><p>yellow corn, sorghum, and corn meal.  This price band is </p><p>calculated from a time series of international prices on a given </p><p>product for the prior 60 months.  The 15 highest and lowest </p><p>monthly prices are eliminated, with the remaining highs and lows </p><p>establishing the price band.  Imports entering with values within </p><p>the defined band are assessed a 20 percent tariff.  Imports </p><p>entering with prices above the band are assessed duties at a rate </p><p>lower than 20 percent, according to a predetermined schedule; </p><p>those imports priced below the band are assessed a tariff higher </p><p>than 20 percent.  However, the government also maintains a </p><p>seasonal restriction on the price band.  From September to </p><p>January the minimum allowable duty is 20 percent for corn and 15 </p><p>percent for cornmeal and sorghum.  From February to August, </p><p>duties are allowed to fluctuate according to the predetermined </p><p>duty tables for each commodity.  This seasonal restriction has </p><p>been added to provide additional protection to local grain </p><p>farmers during the main harvest season.  In addition to the </p><p>above, the Government of Honduras, farm groups, and importers </p><p>have agreed to a quasi-tariff-rate quota in which the price band </p><p>remains in effect until local grain supplies are exhausted, after </p><p>which a one percent duty is applied to imports.  The United </p><p>States has strongly opposed the Honduran policies on corn and </p><p>sorghum as limiting access for U.S. agricultural products. </p><p> </p><p>STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING AND CERTIFICATION </p><p> </p><p>7.  Honduras has had a ban on U.S. raw poultry imports for some </p><p>time.  USDA FAS estimates that if Honduran restrictions on U.S. </p><p>raw poultry and poultry parts were lifted, U.S. producers could </p><p>export an additional USD 10 million of poultry products to </p><p>Honduras, annually.  The Embassy has received a series of </p><p>complaints in 2002 from local importers regarding import </p><p>restrictions, difficult certification requirements and other </p><p>obstacles to the importation of U.S. pork, poultry and dairy </p><p>products.  Honduran food safety officials have restricted the </p><p>imports of U.S. chicken and pork products citing sanitary </p><p>concerns.  Local importers charge that Honduran officials are </p><p>using sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures to block U.S. imports </p><p>to protect local producers and in some cases to promote diversion </p><p>of trade to other Central American countries.  Changes in </p><p>sanitary and phyto-sanitary requirements are seldom reported to </p><p>the WTO as required, and create uncertainty among U.S. suppliers </p><p>and Honduran importers.  The Honduran government requires that </p><p>sanitary permits be obtained for all imported foodstuffs. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT </p><p> </p><p>8.  Under the new State Contracting Law, which entered into force </p><p>in October 2001, all public works contracts over $63,000 must be </p><p>offered through public competitive bidding.  Public contracts </p><p>between $31,000 and $63,000 can be offered through a private bid </p><p>and contracts less than $31,000 are exempt from the bidding </p><p>process.  To participate in public tenders, foreign firms are </p><p>required to act through a local agent.  Local agency firms must </p><p>be at least 51 percent Honduran-owned, unless the procurement is </p><p>linked to a national emergency.  While foreign firms are granted </p><p>national treatment for public bids, some still complain of </p><p>mismanagement and lack of transparency in the bid processes. </p><p>Government purchases and project acquisitions are generally </p><p>exempted from import duties. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Honduras is not a signatory of the WTO Government Procurement </p><p>Agreement.  In the past, the United States has raised concerns </p><p>regarding Honduras\' lack of cooperation in the WTO Working Party </p><p>on Transparency in Government Procurement.  In recognition of </p><p>increased cooperation in the WTO Working Party on Transparency in </p><p>Government Procurement, the United States reinstated a waiver of </p><p>"Buy America Act" provisions in 2002 which had previously been </p><p>suspended for Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION </p><p> </p><p>10.  Honduras largely has complied with the WTO Agreement on </p><p>Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), </p><p>through legal revisions enacted in December 1999.  The Honduran </p><p>Congress still must, for instance, adopt reforms related to </p><p>integrated circuit designs and plant variety protection to be in </p><p>full compliance with TRIPS. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Honduras and the U.S. initialed a Bilateral Intellectual </p><p>Property Rights (IPR) Agreement in March 1999.  Final signature </p><p>of this agreement is still pending.   Honduras became a member of </p><p>the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 1983. </p><p> </p><p>Copyrights </p><p> </p><p>12.  Honduras\' copyright law, updated in 1999, added more than 20 </p><p>different criminal offenses related to copyright infringement and </p><p>established fines and suspension of services that can be levied </p><p>against offenders.  The piracy of books, sound and video </p><p>recordings, compact discs, and computer software is still </p><p>widespread in Honduras, however, due in part to limited </p><p>enforcement capacity.  U.S. companies are concerned that recent </p><p>attempts to prosecute computer software infringement cases have </p><p>been met with resistance by officials in the Ministry of Industry </p><p>and Trade\'s IPR Division and the Attorney General\'s office. </p><p> </p><p>Patents and Trademarks </p><p> </p><p>13.  Honduras ratified the Paris Convention for the Protection of </p><p>Industrial Property in 1994.  The Honduran Congress enacted a </p><p>1999 Law of Industrial Property to provide improved protection </p><p>for both trademarks and patents.  To be protected under Honduran </p><p>law, patents and trademarks must be registered with the Ministry </p><p>of Industry and Trade. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Recent modifications to the Patent Law of 1993 include </p><p>patent protection for pharmaceuticals, and extend the term of </p><p>protection for a patent from seventeen to twenty years from the </p><p>date of filing to meet WTO standards.  The term for cancellation </p><p>of a trademark for lack of use has been extended from one year to </p><p>three years.  Trademarks are valid for up to 10 years from the </p><p>registration date.  The illegitimate registration of well-known </p><p>trademarks has, however, been a persistent problem in Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>15.  A U.S. pharmaceutical company has complained that the </p><p>Ministry of Health, in approving a competing company\'s </p><p>pharmaceutical product, did not respect their data exclusivity </p><p>rights as guaranteed in article 77 of Honduras\' Industrial </p><p>Property Law and article 39 of the WTO TRIP\'s agreement.  The </p><p>Ministry of Health approved the competing pharmaceutical product, </p><p>despite communication from Honduras\' IPR Division that the U.S. </p><p>company\'s research and data were protected under Honduran law. </p><p>The U.S. company argues that in order for the competing product </p><p>to be legally registered with the Ministry of Health, the company </p><p>needs to provide the research and data to support their </p><p>application.  Honduran law provides five-year exclusive use of </p><p>data provided in support of registering pharmaceutical products. </p><p> </p><p>SERVICES BARRIERS </p><p> </p><p>16.  Special government authorization must be obtained to invest </p><p>in the tourism, hotel and banking services sectors.  Foreigners </p><p>may not hold a seat in Honduras\' two stock exchanges or provide </p><p>direct brokerage services in these exchanges.  Honduran </p><p>professional bodies heavily regulate the licensing of foreigners </p><p>to practice law, medicine, engineering, accounting, and other </p><p>professions. </p><p> </p><p>INVESTMENT BARRIERS </p><p> </p><p>17.  The Constitution of Honduras requires that all foreign </p><p>investment complement, but not substitute for, national </p><p>investment.  Companies that wish to take advantage of the </p><p>Agrarian Reform Law; engage in commercial fishing, forestry, or </p><p>local transportation activities; serve as representatives, </p><p>agents, or distributors for foreign companies; or operate radio </p><p>and television stations must be majority-owned by Hondurans. </p><p>Government authorization is required for both foreign and </p><p>domestic investors in basic health services; telecommunications; </p><p>generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity; air </p><p>transport; and mining. </p><p> </p><p>18.  In addition, special government authorization is required </p><p>for foreign investment in the following sectors: forestry, </p><p>telecommunications, basic health, air transport, fishing and </p><p>aquaculture, mining, insurance and financial services, private </p><p>education, and those agricultural and agro-industrial activities </p><p>exceeding land tenancy limits established by law. </p><p> </p><p>19.  Small-scale commercial and industrial activities with an </p><p>investment less than 150,000 lempiras (about $9,000), excluding </p><p>land, buildings, and vehicles, are reserved exclusively for </p><p>Honduran nationals.  For all investments, at least 90 percent of </p><p>a company\'s labor force must be Honduran, and at least 80 percent </p><p>of the payroll must be paid to Hondurans. </p><p> </p><p>20.  Foreign ownership of land within 40 km of the coastlines and </p><p>national boundaries is constitutionally prohibited, though </p><p>tourism investment laws allow for certain exceptions. Inadequate </p><p>land title procedures have led to numerous investment disputes </p><p>involving U.S.-citizen landowners. </p><p> </p><p>21.  Historically, U.S. firms and private citizens have found </p><p>corruption to be a problem and a constraint on foreign direct </p><p>investment.  Corruption appears to be most pervasive in the </p><p>following areas: government procurement, performance </p><p>requirements, the regulatory system, and the buying and selling </p><p>of real estate, particularly land title transfers.  Honduras\' </p><p>judicial system is easily influenced; investment and business </p><p>disputes involving foreigners have rarely been resolved in a </p><p>transparent manner.  In 2002, however, the Honduran Supreme </p><p>Court, the appeals court and the executive branch have looked </p><p>into some of these specific problems and been helpful in pushing </p><p>delayed cases toward resolution.  The Honduran government also </p><p>has plans to submit a small number of land expropriation cases to </p><p>arbitration. </p><p> </p><p>22.  On July 12, 2001, a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) </p><p>between the U.S. and Honduras entered into force.  The treaty </p><p>provides for equal protection under the law for U.S. investors in </p><p>Honduras and permits expropriation only in accordance with </p><p>international legal standards and accompanied by adequate </p><p>compensation.  U.S. investors in Honduras also have the right to </p><p>submit an investment dispute to binding international </p><p>arbitration.  Honduras has taken the following limited exceptions </p><p>to its BIT national treatment obligation: properties on cays, </p><p>reefs, rocks, shoals or sandbanks or on islands or on any </p><p>property located within 40 km of the coastline or land borders of </p><p>Honduras; small scale industry and commerce with total invested </p><p>capital of no more than $40,000 or its equivalent in national </p><p>currency; ownership, operation and editorial control of broadcast </p><p>radio and television; ownership, operation and editorial control </p><p>of general interest periodicals and newspapers published in </p><p>Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
