(U) This message is sensitive, but unclassified.  Please </p><p>handle accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) This message was prepared with assistance from </p><p>Amconsul Calgary. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Critical infrastructure protection is among the areas </p><p>listed for bilateral action in the Ridge-Manley Smart Border </p><p>plan.  Canada is the United States\' largest foreign supplier </p><p>of energy, supplying over 15 percent of U.S. natural gas </p><p>consumption and about 10 percent of U.S. consumption of oil </p><p>and oil products.  After two decades of strong expansion, </p><p>Canada\'s energy pipeline industry expects to see on the </p><p>order of US$6 billion in additional new facilities </p><p>constructed in the coming decade. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) This industry appears very well prepared to respond </p><p>to accidents/attacks at its facilities.  Time frames for </p><p>pipeline firms\' "patch and repair" operations are from a few </p><p>hours to a few days.  The built-in redundancy of pipeline </p><p>systems (multiple pipes, storage facilities, interconnects, </p><p>back-up compressors) mean that actual disruptions of supply </p><p>(at least beyond the local level or for short periods) are </p><p>considered unlikely. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) While the incidence of accidental events has been </p><p>reduced to a very low level, pipeline industry security </p><p>experts are less confident of their ability to anticipate or </p><p>prevent deliberate attacks.  It is in this area that they </p><p>are most receptive to government support - and most </p><p>interested in clear, timely information flow.  Given their </p><p>degree of professional competence and accountability, and </p><p>since they provide information "up" to government whenever </p><p>asked, they want to share more fully in the flow of </p><p>information "down" from federal level security agencies. </p><p>One provincial government security official said it has been </p><p>a "major achievement" to get the RCMP (federal police) to </p><p>allow even the unclassified versions of threat assessments </p><p>to be distributed to selected private sector players.  END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>INDUSTRY STRUCTURE </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Most of Canada\'s oil and gas pipeline network </p><p>originates in the province of Alberta (with fingers into </p><p>British Columbia, Saskatchewan and the Northwest </p><p>Territories) and transports products southward and/or </p><p>eastward to the United States and central/eastern Canada. </p><p>The industry is collectively represented by the Canadian </p><p>Energy Pipeline Association (cepa.com), based in Calgary. </p><p>Mission economic staff interviewed industry and government </p><p>representatives on critical infrastructure protection issues </p><p>in Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton during January 2003. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) The following two firms respectively claim to operate </p><p>the world\'s longest natural gas and oil pipeline systems. </p><p> </p><p>TRANSCANADA PIPELINES LIMITED (transcanada.com) operates the </p><p>largest portion of the natural gas system.  From southern </p><p>Alberta it exports gas to the Pacific Gas Transmission </p><p>Company, the Montana Power Company, and the Alliance </p><p>Pipeline (which runs southeast through Iowa and Illinois). </p><p>Its "Canadian mainline" (actually a group of parallel lines) </p><p>carries gas eastward across Saskatchewan and Manitoba to the </p><p>Winnipeg area, where the line splits into a U.S. portion </p><p>(continuing across Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan) and a </p><p>Canadian portion (continuing across Ontario to Montreal, </p><p>Toronto and other urban areas). </p><p> </p><p>ENBRIDGE PIPELINES INC. (enbridge.com) operates key oil and </p><p>oil products pipelines.  Its main crude oil line runs from </p><p>Edmonton (mid-Alberta) southeastward to Wisconsin, where the </p><p>line divides to pass both north and south of Lake Michigan. </p><p>This system serves key oil storage and </p><p>refinery/petrochemicals complexes in Edmonton, Sarnia </p><p>(Ontario) and Montreal (Quebec) as well as in the United </p><p>States. </p><p> </p><p>PAST INCIDENTS WERE ACCIDENTAL </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) Emergency planning necessarily makes heavy use of the </p><p>analysis of past incidents.  However, in Canada\'s pipeline </p><p>industry, past incidents have been due to material failures </p><p>- notably stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in pipe walls and </p><p>disintegration of blades in compressor turbines.  The </p><p>frequency of these problems has been systematically reduced </p><p>through innovation, inspection and maintenance but they </p><p>still occur, and there are older facilities in use which may </p><p>be at higher risk.  On the positive side, these older </p><p>facilities represent part of the built-in redundancy which </p><p>the system uses to continue service when a failure occurs. </p><p> </p><p>PIPELINE FIRMS LEAD ON-THE-GROUND RESPONSE </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Most pipeline facilities are buried, and the force </p><p>of an explosion/rupture tends to go upward, so damage seldom </p><p>extends to neighboring pipes.  Automatic "block valves" </p><p>immediately shut off flow through the ruptured segment(s). </p><p>Neighboring facilities are also shut off until they can be </p><p>inspected (operating them at very low pressure is also an </p><p>option). </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) Pipeline firms say they maintain close </p><p>relationships with landowners, municipalities, and volunteer </p><p>fire departments along their routes in order to enhance both </p><p>monitoring of the pipeline, and emergency response.  Company </p><p>employees help to train local firefighters, and these two </p><p>groups in combination are the "first responders" to pipeline </p><p>emergencies. </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) Typical time to patch a pipeline rupture is one to </p><p>two days and typical time for restoration of full service is </p><p>three to four days.  Due to system redundancy and storage, </p><p>service to end users is unlikely to be affected in the </p><p>meanwhile.  If necessary, a "bypass" around a damaged </p><p>segment can be built in about four days.  If a compressor is </p><p>affected, a temporary replacement can be moved and installed </p><p>in a day or two, though permanent replacement takes much </p><p>longer -- one to two years -- due to long delivery times </p><p>from the manufacturers (GE and Rolls-Royce). </p><p> </p><p>PREVENTION/MITIGATION </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) While a few politically motivated attacks on oil </p><p>and gas facilities have occurred, neither of the major </p><p>pipeline systems has significant experience of being </p><p>deliberately attacked.  Many of their monitoring activities </p><p>- such as "flying the line" by helicopter at low altitude </p><p>and "sniffing" for leaks - are oriented toward accidental </p><p>events.  With facilities crossing thousands of miles in very </p><p>remote areas, corporate security experts admit that there is </p><p>little they can do to protect all this pipe from deliberate </p><p>sabotage.  Obvious key points (such as compressors, storage </p><p>facilities, and refineries where an attack could be more </p><p>disruptive) fortunately are exceptions which can be </p><p>protected to some degree by conventional security methods. </p><p> </p><p>PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT ROLE:  "SECURITY TEMPLATES" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>13. (U) The Alberta provincial government requires each of </p><p>311 municipalities to identify a full-time employee as </p><p>Director of Disaster Services.  This employee is empowered </p><p>to declare a state of local emergency, can conscript local </p><p>resources and labor, and is partially protected from </p><p>litigation arising from actions taken during a state of </p><p>emergency. </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Alberta\'s "Critical Infrastructure Protection </p><p>Plan" is based in part on methods developed by the American </p><p>Petroleum Institute, and has recently been applied to ten </p><p>key industries, beginning with oil.  Industry and government </p><p>worked together to classify facilities by level of </p><p>"criticality."  Information such as the list of participants </p><p>in this process and the list of facilities determined </p><p>"critical" is not made public.  Provincial Disaster Services </p><p>staff visit each of these facilities, collect contact </p><p>information, and make recommendations based on "security </p><p>templates." </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Levels of "alert" (none, low, medium, high, </p><p>imminent) are also determined from time to time, based on </p><p>threat assessments received from federal agencies.  The </p><p>"security template" applied to each facility depends on that </p><p>facility\'s combination of criticality and threat level, and </p><p>is based on "best practices."  Provincial government </p><p>officials say that their recommendations represent "minimum </p><p>expectations" and that operators are driven by insurance </p><p>concerns to meet or exceed these standards. </p><p> </p><p>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ROLE:  THREAT ASSESSMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Observers and security officials unanimously agree </p><p>that the GOC\'s two-year-old Office of Critical </p><p>Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness </p><p>(OCIPEP) is not as far advanced as Alberta Disaster Services </p><p>in its state of readiness, nor in its close ties to </p><p>industry.  OCIPEP relies on line departments such as Natural </p><p>Resources Canada (NRCan) to liaise with industry.  Mission </p><p>will examine OCIPEP\'s broader role and functions in coming </p><p>months. </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) From the perspective of industry and </p><p>local/provincial security officials, the GOC\'s crucial role </p><p>is as the source (or at least the conduit) for intelligence </p><p>information on which "declarations of alert" must be based. </p><p>Apart from OCIPEP, key agencies here are the Canadian </p><p>Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the Royal Canadian </p><p>Mounted Police (RCMP - Canada\'s federal police service). </p><p>Our contacts expressed various uncertainties and </p><p>dissatisfactions surrounding such intelligence.  For </p><p>example: </p><p> </p><p>-- What intelligence do RCMP and CSIS want from the private </p><p>sector and the public?  One industry leader complained, "We </p><p>give the police lots of information and they tell us </p><p>nothing."  Potential suppliers of information need to know </p><p>whether or not what they provided in the past was considered </p><p>useful.  (COMMENT:  While our contacts were careful not to </p><p>criticize the GOC, we sensed that they would like to be </p><p>reassured about the effectiveness of federal agencies, i.e. </p><p>whether information reaches analysts and is duly </p><p>incorporated into threat assessments, and whether different </p><p>parts of the GOC are sharing information with each other. </p><p>END COMMENT). </p><p> </p><p>-- How much detail will be disseminated?  Currently, RCMP </p><p>and CSIS prepare both classified and unclassified versions </p><p>of threat assessments; only the latter is shared with </p><p>provincial governments and industry representatives.  Also, </p><p>in their support of intelligence gathering, firms provide </p><p>RCMP and CSIS with commercially sensitive information from </p><p>time to time, and they do not want such information re- </p><p>appearing in their competitors\' offices. </p><p> </p><p>-- How often will threat assessments be issued?  This is </p><p>currently undetermined.  Our contacts opined that they </p><p>should be issued regularly, even if unchanged, in order to </p><p>remind users of their existence. </p><p> </p><p>-- How widely will threat assessments be disseminated?  A </p><p>provincial government security official (who is a former </p><p>RCMP officer) said it was a "major achievement" to persuade </p><p>the RCMP to allow even unclassified versions of threat </p><p>assessments to be shared with industry security officials </p><p>(rather than only government agencies). </p><p> </p><p>-- Who bears responsibility for formally declaring states of </p><p>alert?  This raises real issues of legal liability. </p><p>According to our contacts in the Alberta government, the </p><p>Solicitor General of Alberta (the senior provincial law </p><p>enforcement officer) currently holds this responsibility </p><p>(despite having limited access to intelligence information) </p><p>and no office in the GOC will make a commitment to this </p><p>function. </p><p> </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS WITH USG </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) Among our contacts, mentions of dealings with the </p><p>USG on safety/security matters were strongly positive.  The </p><p>U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and </p><p>Department of Transportation (DOT) investigate pipeline </p><p>accidents which occur within the U.S., where both Enbridge </p><p>and TransCanada have many facilities.  In mid-2002 a rupture </p><p>in Minnesota led to NTSB investigators paying an extended </p><p>visit to Enbridge corporate headquarters in Edmonton.  The </p><p>report is still pending, but according to Enbridge the firm </p><p>was commended for their quick response to the incident. </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) Industry security officials say they receive </p><p>regular notices from the FBI\'s National Infrastructure </p><p>Protection Center.  One industry association leader told us </p><p>his organization has a "very valuable relationship with the </p><p>FBI" and that "we get better information from the FBI than </p><p>from the RCMP."  Our contacts also said they receive useful </p><p>security-related information from the U.S. Department of </p><p>Energy\'s Office of Energy Assurance and also from the </p><p>American Petroleum Institute. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU) The federal Government of Canada\'s Office of </p><p>Critical Infrastructure Protection and Emergency </p><p>Preparedness (OCIPEP) is relatively new and is still </p><p>establishing itself in many areas of its mandate.  While </p><p>Mission staff are developing our relationship with and </p><p>understanding of OCIPEP, we see great value in continuing to </p><p>foster close cooperation with Provincial government </p><p>authorities and private sector entities, such as the major </p><p>pipeline and energy firms, who are now and will likely </p><p>remain the first responders in an emergency. </p><p> </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
