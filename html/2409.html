<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 000326 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>EUR/WE (MENNUTI), NEA/IAI (SELDOWITZ) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/22/2012 </p><p>TAGS: IS, PREL, VT, MEPP, terrorism </p><p>SUBJECT: PRESSING VATICAN ON PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) STATE 6165 B) FROWICK/MENNUTI/SELDOWITZ </p><p> </p><p>        EMAILS 1/18/02 </p><p>     B. C) MERANTE/SILBERMAN EMAIL 1/18/02 D) STATE 3410 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON, REASON E.O. 12958 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  AMBASSADOR TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A FRIDAY, 01/18 MEETING </p><p>WITH VATICAN FM EQUIVALENT JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN TO PRESS REFTEL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  00326  221703Z </p><p>POINTS ON THE ZINNI MISSION AND TO ASK TAURAN TO REQUEST </p><p>PRESIDENT ARAFAT TO HALT THE VIOLENCE AND TAKE STEPS TO </p><p>PROSECUTE THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KARINE A WEAPONS </p><p>SHIPMENT.  TAURAN, WHO IN THE PAST HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE </p><p>PROPONENT OF THE HOLY SEE\'S "TILT" TOWARD THE PALESTINIANS </p><p>AND OF VATICAN INTERESTS IN PROTECTING THE HOLY SITES IN </p><p>JERUSALEM, TOOK THE POINTS ON BOARD, SAYING ARAFAT "WILL HEAR </p><p>FROM US."  TAURAN ASKED THE AMBASSADOR WHETHER HE PERSONALLY </p><p>KNEW GEN. ZINNI.  (NOTE: WE TAKE ALL THIS TO MEAN A) THAT </p><p>SOMEONE IN THE VATICAN WILL SPEAK DIRECTLY EITHER TO ARAFAT </p><p>OR TO ONE OF HIS PEOPLE AND B) THE VATICAN WOULD BE </p><p>INTERESTED IN MEETING WITH GEN. ZINNI). </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) IN THE MEANTIME, AT HIS WEEKLY ANGELUS MESSAGE THE </p><p>POPE REFERRED TO THE "DEAD END" INTO WHICH THE CONFLICTING </p><p>PARTIES HAVE FOUGHT THEMSELVES AND CALLED FOR THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NOT TO ABANDON THEM TO THEIR FATE. </p><p>THIS FALLS ON THE HEELS OF HIS ANNUAL ADDRESS TO THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS IN WHICH HE DEFENDED ISRAEL\'S RIGHT TO </p><p>SECURITY WHILE DECRYING THE "FIFTY YEARS OF OPPRESSION" WHICH </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS HAVE SUFFERED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ON A SOMEWHAT RELATED ISSUE, THE EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR </p><p>TO THE HOLY SEE, FAROUK RAAFAT, DROPPED IN TO SEE THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR FRIDAY.  RAAFAT ASKED IF THE USG WAR ON TERRORISM </p><p>WOULD TURN NEXT TO IRAQ.  HIS DCM MET SEPARATELY ON THE SAME </p><p>ISSUE WITH EMBASSY VATICAN DCM THE DAY BEFORE. BOTH PRESSED </p><p>FOR THE USG TO TAKE IT SLOW ON IRAQ -- AND SEE WHETHER WE </p><p>COULD "WAIT SADAAM OUT." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  COMMENT:  CLEARLY THE VATICAN WILL SEEK TO DEFEND ITS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  00326  221703Z </p><p>OWN INTERESTS IN THE ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN CONFLICT (THE RIGHTS </p><p>OF CHRISTIANS ABOVE ALL). BUT A FUNDAMENTAL VATICAN INTEREST </p><p>IS SEEING AN END TO THE VIOLENCE COMMITTED AGAINST BOTH </p><p>SIDES.  WITH THAT IN MIND WE REQUEST DEPARTMENT CONSIDER A </p><p>ZINNI DROP BY DURING ONE OF HIS FUTURE VISITS TO THE REGION. </p><p>WE BELIEVE THE POPE WOULD WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM DIRECTLY ABOUT </p><p>POSSIBLE PATHS TO PEACE.  ON IRAQ, WE NOTE THAT THE VATICAN </p><p>HAS NOT BEEN VOCAL ABOUT SANCTIONS IN RECENT WEEKS, INCLUDING </p><p>DURING THE POPE\'S ANNUAL ADDRESS.  FROM THE VATICAN </p><p>PERSPECTIVE, SANCTIONS ARE ALWAYS BAD; FAR WORSE, HOWEVER, </p><p>WOULD BE A MILITARY STRIKE.  IF THE USG WERE TO INITIATE A </p><p>BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN IRAQ, THE VATICAN WOULD MOVE FROM ITS </p><p>FIRM SUPPORT OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO FAR IN AFGHANISTAN TO </p><p>VIGOROUS AND PUBLIC OPPOSITION. END COMMENT. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2002VATICA00326 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
