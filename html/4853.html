THE QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPED FOR THE PDM WAS APPROVED </p><p>BY THE GOI.

EVEN SO, THE SURVEY HAS PROVIDED WFP WITH </p><p>SOME GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT VULNERABILITY.  IN THE NORTH, THE </p><p>SURVEY WAS MORE SOPHISTICATED AND WAS MODELED AFTER  SAVE THE </p><p>CHILDREN HOUSEHOLD FOOD ECONOMY METHODOLOGY, WHEREBY FAMILIES </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  06133  03 OF 05  241417Z </p><p>ARE DIVIDED INTO ONE OF FOUR INCOME GROUPS:  RICH, </p><p>MIDDLE-INCOME, POOR, AND VERY POOR. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE GREATEST VULNERABILITY IN THE </p><p>COUNTRY, DUE SAID THAT THOSE LIVING IN THE BASRA REGION IN </p><p>THE SOUTH ARE THE POOREST IN THE COUNTRY AND VERY VULNERABLE, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN OIL-RICH AREA.  DUE SAID THAT OTHER THAN </p><p>BASRA, THE VULNERABLE ARE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  70 </p><p>PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IN CENTRAL/SOUTH LIVE IN THE </p><p>CITIES, BUT DUE DOES NOT FEEL THAT THE URBAN POPULATION IS </p><p>NECESSARILY MORE VULNERABLE THAN SOME IN RURAL AREAS.  SOME </p><p>30 TO 35 PERCENT OF IRAQIS MAKE UP THE POOREST OF THE POOR, </p><p>SAYS DUE, AND THEY SELL PART OF THE MONTHLY RATION IN ORDER </p><p>TO COME UP WITH THE 250 DINARS PER PERSON (EQUAL TO 0.12 USD) </p><p>NEEDED TO PURCHASE THE NEXT MONTH\'S RATION. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) DUE ALSO STATED THAT EVEN THOUGH BENEFICIARIES </p><p>RECEIVED A TWO-MONTHS RATION IN NOVEMBER AND IN DECEMBER, </p><p>WHICH IN THEORY WOULD PROVIDE FOOD UNTIL THE END OF MARCH, </p><p>THE POOREST WOULD ONLY HAVE FOOD UP TO LATE FEBRUARY OR EARLY </p><p>MARCH IN A BEST-CASE SCENARIO.  SOME WILL HAVE SOLD PART OF </p><p>IT FOR OTHER NEEDED ITEMS OR CASH.  IN ADDITION, THE PDM </p><p>VISITS SHOW THAT THE RATION LASTS ABOUT 20-25 DAYS RATHER </p><p>THAN A FULL MONTH.

SECURITY COUNCIL GIVE WFP LEGAL </p><p>OWNERHSIP OF THE OIL FOR IRAQ PROGRAM (OIP) FOOD CONTRACTS. </p><p>THIS LEGALITY IS VITAL TO ENSURING THAT THERE IS ENOUGH FOOD </p><p>IN THE PIPELINE TO FEED THE CURRENT NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>STAFF PREPARATIONS </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>15.

FIVE NATIONAL </p><p>STAFF RECENTLY ATTENDED WFP\'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAINING </p><p>COURSE HELD IN SWEDEN, AND 60 NATIONAL STAFF WILL SOON BE </p><p>TRAINED IN ASSESSING HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY.  LASTLY, WFP </p><p>HUMAN RELATIONS IS DEVELOPING A TRAINING ENTITLED "JUST IN </p><p>TIME" WHICH WILL BE READY BY JANUARY 17 AND MADE AVAILABLE TO </p><p>WFP IRAQ NATIONAL STAFF.  THIS TRAINING CONTAINS SEVERAL </p><p>DIFFERENT MODULES PERTAINING TO WFP FIELD OPERATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>                          SECRET </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  06133  04 OF 05  241418Z </p><p>16.  (C) DUE SAID THAT IF THE MOT STAFF COULD NOT CONTINUE </p><p>THEIR CURRENT FUNCTIONS AND WFP HAD TO PLAY THOSE ROLES, WFP </p><p>WOULD NEED APPROXIMATELY 2,600 ADDITIONAL NATIONAL STAFF AND </p><p>150 TO 200 INTERNATIONAL STAFF.  (COMMENT.  FINDING 150 TO </p><p>200 EXPERIENCED EMERGENCY WFP INTERNATIONAL STAFF, WHILE </p><p>MAINTAINING ITS CURRENT WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS, WOULD BE A </p><p>MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR WFP.

(S) WHEN ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT THE GOI MIGHT DO IF </p><p>ATTACKED THAT WOULD INHIBIT WFP\'S OPERATION, DUE SAID THAT </p><p>SADDAM MIGHT BLOW UP PORT UMM QASR, AS WELL AS THE MAJOR BULK </p><p>WHEAT STORAGE AND MILLING INSTALLATION ALSO LOCATED AT THE </p><p>PORT.  THE PORT MUST BE CLEANED DAILY DUE TO THE SAND/SILT </p><p>THAT COLLECTS EACH DAY, SO THAT LARGE SHIPS CAN DOCK.  ANY </p><p>EXPLOSION WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR SHIPS TO DOCK AT THE </p><p>PORT UNTIL NEW DREDGES ARRIVED TO RE-START THE DAILY DREDGING </p><p>OPERATION.
