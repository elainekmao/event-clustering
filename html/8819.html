<p>UNCLAS HANOI 001533 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV and DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  NA </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PGOV, PINS, VM, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT:  Thirteen-Year Sentence for Pham Hong Son </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  This is an action request.  See paragraph 7. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Summary:  The Hanoi People\'s Court sentenced Pham </p><p>Hong Son to thirteen years in prison followed by 3 years </p><p>administrative probation after a trial that lasted several </p><p>hours on June 18.  The conviction appears to have been for </p><p>"espionage" under Article 80 of the SRV Criminal Code.  The </p><p>charge against him does not specifically mention his </p><p>translation and distribution of "What is Democracy."  His </p><p>wife, Vu Thuy Ha, was allowed into the trial, but poloff and </p><p>other foreign observers were barred, despite persistent </p><p>official requests to attend.  Embassy requests clearance of </p><p>suggested press guidance.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Poloff obtained what appears to be a translation </p><p>of the charge against Son.  The specific crime cited is: </p><p>"Providing or collecting secret information belonging to the </p><p>Government to foreign countries; collecting other documents </p><p>forward (sic) the purpose of using for foreign countries </p><p>against the Government of the Socialist Republic of </p><p>Vietnam."  The charges mention no specific "countries," but </p><p>connect Son with Nguyen Gia Kieng, "a suspected leader of </p><p>Thong Luan\'s group in France."  Embassy is not familiar with </p><p>this person or this group. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  According to a journalist who arrived early at </p><p>the court, Ms. Ha, Son\'s wife, was allowed into the court, </p><p>but her brother was not.  The journalist said a few other </p><p>Vietnamese persons entered the court at that time, but he </p><p>did not recognize any of them, having expected to see some </p><p>of the activists who had appeared outside the court during </p><p>Le Chi Quang\'s trial in November 2002. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  Court officials did not allow poloff or any other </p><p>of eight foreign diplomats and journalists present to enter </p><p>the court.  The Hanoi People\'s Court did not answer </p><p>Embassy\'s written request for permission to attend the </p><p>trial, although it had promised a reply by June 12.  Embassy </p><p>phoned the court repeatedly beginning June 12, but court </p><p>officials invariably said that the Deputy Chief Judge -- who </p><p>alone had authority to answer -- was busy and/or </p><p>unavailable. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  Five other Western embassies submitted requests </p><p>to attend the trial, some through the Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs\' (MFA) Consular Department.  None received a formal </p><p>response before the trial began.  After repeated follow-up </p><p>phone calls, the Consular Department informed one Western </p><p>diplomat waiting outside the court over an hour after the </p><p>trial began that MFA would be informing the court that </p><p>"there was no need for foreigners to attend Son\'s trial." </p><p>The Canadian Embassy subsequently received a fax (Para 8) </p><p>from the MFA explaining the decision. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Suggested press guidance: </p><p> </p><p>We strongly condemn this harsh sentence on Pham Hong Son and </p><p>remain convinced than no one should be imprisoned even for </p><p>one day for the peaceful expression of non-violent views. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Canadian Embassy unofficial translation of MFA </p><p>Consular Affairs fax: </p><p> </p><p>"Pham Hong Son is a Vietnamese citizen who has violated </p><p>Vietnamese laws.  The trial of (his) case is the internal </p><p>affairs of the Court.  In addition, to date the People\'s </p><p>Court of Hanoi has not arranged for any representatives of </p><p>any foreign countries to attend a trial of a Vietnamese </p><p>citizen.  Therefore it is regrettable that the People\'s </p><p>Court of Hanoi is not in a position to meet the request of </p><p>the Embassy." </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
