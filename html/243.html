THE FIRST CONCERNED </p><p>SIX INDIVIDUALS ACCUSED OF A STRING OF SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>DIRECTED BOMBINGS OF SUSPECTED ANC TARGETS IN HARARE AND </p><p>BULAWAYO OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.  THE SECOND WAS THE </p><p>CASE OF A MOZAMBICAN NATIONAL ACCUSED OF BEING A RENAMO </p><p>TERRORIST. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ONE OF THE SIX ALLEGED SOUTH AFRICAN AGENTS, RORY </p><p>MAGUIRE, WAS CONVICTED AND SENTENCED IN JULY TO SEVEN </p><p>YEARS FOR HIS ROLE IN THE BOMBINGS.  THREE OTHERS-- </p><p>KEVIN WOODS, MICHAEL SMITH AND PHILLIP CONJWAYO--ARE </p><p>BEING TRIED AT PRESENT.  TWO--BARRY BAWDEN AND GUY </p><p>BAWDEN--STILL AWAIT TRIAL. </p><p> </p><p>4.

MATAVEYA KILLED TWO CIVILIANS, </p><p>INCLUDING A YOUNG BOY, IN APRIL 1987.  HIS WAS THE FIRST </p><p>TRIAL IN ZIMBABWEAN COURTS OF AN ALLEGED RENAMO </p><p>TERRORIST. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PLO STATUS </p><p>---------- </p><p>5.  THE PLO IS ACCORDED FULL DIPLOMATIC STATUS INCLUDING </p><p>AN ACCREDITED AMBASSADOR.  THIS IS UNCHANGED SINCE 1987. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>6.  NONE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN 1988 </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>7.  THE MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM ACTIONS THIS YEAR HAVE </p><p>BEEN: </p><p> </p><p>-- CONTINUING EFFORTS TO COUNTER AND CONTAIN RENAMO </p><p>INCURSIONS INTO EASTERN ZIMBABWE AND ESPECIALLY RENAMO </p><p>ATTACKS ON BORDER CIVILIAN POPULATIONS.  THOUGH THE </p><p>LEVEL OF SUCH RENAMO ACTIVITY MAY HAVE DROPPED, </p><p>CIVILIANS ALONG THE BORDER ARE STILL SUBJECT TO MURDER, </p><p>MUTILATION AND DISAPPEARANCE. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE ARREST AND ELIMINATION OF A MAJOR NETWORK OF </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN AGENTS APPARENTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL </p><p>BOMBING ATTACKS AGAINST SUSPECTED ANC TARGETS IN RECENT </p><p>YEARS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE AMNESTY DECLARED IN APRIL WHICH, ALONG WITH THE </p><p>UNITY AGREEMENT BETWEEN ZANU AND ZAPU, EFFECTIVELY ENDED </p><p>DISSIDENT VIOLENCE IN MATABELELAND.  113 DISSIDENTS </p><p>TURNED THEMSELVES IN ACCOUNTING FOR MOST ALL THOSE </p><p>BELIEVED TO BE OPERATING IN THE BUSH. </p><p> </p><p>RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>8.

SO FAR THIS YEAR THERE HAVE </p><p>BEEN TWO CONVICTIONS, AS OUTLINED ABOVE, WHILE OTHER </p><p>TRIALS ARE STILL UNDER WAY. </p><p> </p><p>SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>9.  ZIMBABWE ACCORDS THE ANC REPRESENTATIVE IN HARARE </p><p>OFFICIAL STATUS AND SUPPORTS THE ANC\'S POLITICAL GOAL OF </p><p>AN END TO APARTHEID.  SOME 250 SOUTH AFRICAN EXILES FIND </p><p>REFUGE IN ZIMBABWE.  IN THE PAST, THE SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS CHARGED THAT THE ANC HAS LAUNCHED ATTACKS </p><p>WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA FROM ZIMBABWEAN TERRITORY.  BUT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT MAKES A GENUINE EFFORT TO CONTROL </p><p>ANC ACTIVITY ON ZIMBABWEAN TERRITORY.  THERE IS NO </p><p>EVIDENCE OF ANY PERMANENT ANC MILITARY PRESENCE IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RAWLINGS </p><p></p></div>
