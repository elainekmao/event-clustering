LEBANON\'S MOST PROMINENT SUNNI RELIGIOUS </p><p>LEADER CALLED UPON THE ISLAMIC WORLD TO SUPPORT THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS WHILE WAGING JIHAD TO PROTECT THE HOLY </p><p>SITES IN JERUSALEM.  FORCED TO WATCH THE INTIFADA FROM </p><p>THE SIDELINES, LEBANON\'S PALESTINIANS VENTED THEIR </p><p>FRUSTRATIONS THOUGH A WEEK-LONG SERIES OF MARCHES AND </p><p>RALLIES IN REFUGEE CAMPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  THE AL- </p><p>AQSA MARTYRS BRIGADE, A RADICAL OFFSHOOT OF FATAH, </p><p>WARNED OF ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELI AND U.S. TARGETS. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) GOVERNMENT SPEAKS UP.  KNOWN FOR EXPRESSING </p><p>ONLY THE MOST PERFUNCTORY SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>CAUSE, THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT FELT COMPELLED TO SPEAK </p><p>OUT AFTER LAST WEEK\'S VIOLENCE IN JERUSALEM, THE WEST </p><p>BANK, AND GAZA.  IN WHAT WAS FOR HIM A RARE PUBLIC </p><p>EXPRESSION ON THE MATTER, PM HARIRI KICKED OFF THE </p><p>WAVE OF GOL CRITICISM, CALLING ISRAEL\'S JULY 29 </p><p>"ASSAULT" ON THE AL-AQSA MOSQUE "AN ATTEMPT TO EXPUNGE </p><p>THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC IDENTITY" FROM THE SITE. </p><p>RETURNING TO A MORE MUTED TONE, PM HARIRI RESPONDED TO </p><p>THE JULY 31 ATTACK IN NABLUS BY WARNING, "THE FLOW OF </p><p>BLOOD IS ABOUT TO THREATEN THE WHOLE REGION," AND </p><p>CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO STOP THE </p><p>MASSACRE OF PALESTINIANS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) SPEAKER/AMAL LEADER NABIH BERRI DELIVERED A </p><p>HARSHER DENUNCIATION, CALLING THE ISRAELI ACTION "THE </p><p>HIGHEST LEVEL OF STATE TERRORISM."  SEEKING TO BOLSTER </p><p>AMALQS POSITION IN THE UPCOMING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN </p><p>THE SOUTH, BERRI TOOK A SWIPE AT THE U.S., POINTEDLY </p><p>NOTING THAT THE ISRAELIS "USED THE MOST SOPHISTICATED </p><p>AMERICAN WEAPONS."  ALONE OF THE TROIKA, PRESIDENT </p><p>LAHOUD MADE NO COMMENT ON THE NABLUS ATTACK. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) HIZBALLAH LASHES OUT AT U.S.  HIZBALLAH </p><p>RESPONDED TO THE UPSURGE IN VIOLENCE WITH A VOLLEY OF </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIANS.  CALLING THE DEFENSE OF </p><p>JERUSALEM "A SACRED RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY MUSLIM AND </p><p>ARAB," HIZBALLAH ARRANGED MARCHES AND PROTESTS ALONG </p><p>THE LEBANON-ISRAEL BORDER TO PRESS THEIR PONT HOME. </p><p>AFTER THE NABLUS KILLINGS, HOWEVER, HIZBALLAH LAUNCHED </p><p>A FIERY ASSAULT AGAINST THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, </p><p>CLAIMING IT BEARS "DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY" FOR THE </p><p>KILLINGS "THROUGH THE SUPPORT IT EXTENDS TO THE </p><p>ZIONIST ENTITY, AND THE JUSTIFICATION IT PROVIDES FOR </p><p>THEIR CRIMES."  ALTHOUGH ACKNOWLEDGING SECRETARY </p><p>POWELL\'S CRITICISM OF ISRAEL\'S POLICY OF TARGETED </p><p>KILLINGS, SHIA CLERIC HUSAYN FADLALLAH IMPLIED THAT </p><p>U.S. CONCERN WAS NOT GENUINE BECAUSE "U.S. VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY DESCRIBED THE MASSACRES AS SELF </p><p>DEFENSE BY THE ISRAELIS... AND PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH </p><p>CALLED FOR SELF-RESTRAINT AS IF THE PALESTINIANS WERE </p><p>EQUALLY THE SOURCE OF THE VIOLENCE."  REITERATING HIS </p><p>CALL FOR AN ECONOMIC BOYCOTT ON THE U.S., FADLALLAH </p><p>ALSO CALLED UPON THE ARABS TO "EXERT PRSSURE ON </p><p>AMERICAN TROOPS IN THE GULF TO MAKE WASHINGTON </p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT ITS POLICIES AND INTERESTS IN THE ARAB </p><p>AND MUSLIM WORLDS." </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) PUNDITS ALSO BLAME US, EXPECT WIDER CONFLICT. </p><p>CRITICIZING THE NABLUS ATTACK AS A "BLOODY MASSACRE" </p><p>MANY LEBANESE NEWSPAPERS CARRIED GRUESOME CLOSE-UP </p><p>PHOTOS OF THE CHILDREN KILLED IN THE ISRAELI </p><p>OPERATION.  ALTHOUGH THE SECRETARY\'S CRITICISM OF THE </p><p>ATTACK DREW FRONT-PAGE COVERAGE, EDITORIALISTS TENDED </p><p>TO BLAME THE U.S. FOR WHAT THEY SEE AS A WORSENING </p><p>CRISIS.  IN AN EDITORIAL ENTITLED, "THE REGION IS </p><p>ABOUT TO EXPLODE" PRO-LAHOUD DAILY, AL-BAYRAQ WROTE, </p><p>"SHARON WILL BE SATISFIED WITH HIS JOB AS LONG AS HE </p><p>RECEIVES AMERICAQS BLESSING... THE ATMOSPHERE OF WAR </p><p>IS GETTING HEAVIER AND... SHARON IS PUSHING THE REGION </p><p>TOWARDS THE ABYSS... HOWEVER, ONLY WASHINGTON IS </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SITUATION." </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) SUNNIS JOIN THE FRAY.  AS THE WEEK DREW TO A </p><p>CLOSE, THE HIGHEST-RANKING SUNNI FIGURE IN LEBANON, </p><p>GRAND MUFTI SHAYKH MOHAMED RASHID QABBANI, ADDRESSED A </p><p>GROUP OF 500 DEMONSTRATORS TO GARNER SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  DEPICTING THE CURRENT VIOLENCE AS A </p><p>FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF MUSLIM SITES, QABBANI CALLED UPON </p><p>ALL MUSLIMS TO JOIN THE JIHAD AGAINST ISRAEL BECAUSE </p><p>IT "INTENDS TO DESTROY THE AL-AQSA MOSQUE IN ORDER TO </p><p>BUILD ITS ALLEGED TEMPLE ON TOP OF IT."  QABBANI </p><p>PROMISED THAT "WHEN THE TIME COMES, WE WILL JOIN YOU </p><p>IN UPROOTING THE ISRAELI STATE.  WHEN THAT DAY COMES, </p><p>NEITHER THEIR HELICOPTERS, NOR THEIR FLEETS NOR </p><p>SUPPORTING POWERS WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE THEM." </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) PALESTINIAN PROTESTS.  PALESTINIANS IN LEBANON </p><p>STAGED A SERIES OF PROTESTS AND SIT-INS THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>WEEK.  THE OCCUPANTS OF THE AYN AL-HELWEH CAMP STAGED </p><p>THE LARGEST DEMONSTRATION ON AUGUST 1, WITH NEARLY </p><p>5,000 REFUGEES -- SOME 100 OF THEM REPORTEDLY ARMED -- </p><p>TAKING TO THE STREETS OF THE CAMP.  THEY CHANTED DEATH </p><p>THREATS TO SHARON, BURNT ISRAELI AND AMERICAN FLAGS, </p><p>AND CARRIED BANNERS THREATENING TO "LIQUIDATE" </p><p>PALESTINIAN COLLABORATORS.  SMALLER DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>WERE HELD IN SHATILA, BADDAWI AND RASHIDIYEH CAMPS, </p><p>WHERE PROTESTORS CALLED FOR AN ESCALATION OF THE </p><p>INTIFADA AND DEMANDED THAT THE ARAB STATES FULFILL </p><p>THEIR COMMITMENTS TO THE PALESTINIANS. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) RADICALS THREATEN THE U.S.  THE AL-AQSA MARTYRS </p><p>BRIGADE, A RADICAL OFF-SHOOT OF FATAH, DELIVERED A </p><p>LETTER TO THE AFP OFFICES IN BEIRUT ON AUGUST 1 </p><p>CLAIMING THEIR "FIGHTERS\' WEAPONS WOULD BE POINTED </p><p>TOWARDS TARGETS INSIDE THE ZIONIST ENTITY AND IN ALL </p><p>PLACES WHERE ITS AMERICAN ALLIES ARE."  THE GROUP </p><p>PROMISED TO INFLICT A "BLOODY INTERNATIONAL PUNISHMENT </p><p>ON PRESIDENT BUSH\'S ZIONIST CLIQUE TO MAKE IT PAY FOR </p><p>ITS SUPPORT TO SHARON." </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT: WHILE SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIANS </p><p>REMAINS (AT BEST) LETHARGIC IN LEBANON, PUBLIC </p><p>SYMPATHY FOR THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE IS ON THE RISE </p><p>GIVEN THE PAST WEEK\'S ENDLESS STREAMS OF MEDIA </p><p>COVERAGE DEPICTING THE VICTIMS OF ISRAELI ROCKET, TANK </p><p>AND SHOOTING ATTACKS.  CONFLICT AT AL-AQSA ALSO HITS A </p><p>POPULAR CHORD IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY, RALLYING </p><p>POLITICIANS AND RELIGIOUS FIGURES TO TAKE A STRONG </p><p>PUBLIC STAND -- OR RISK BEING LEFT BEHIND. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HALE </p><p></p></div>
