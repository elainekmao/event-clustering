<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 03703 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PTER TU SY </p><p>SUBJECT:  SYRIA AND NEWS OF A "NEW AND GRAVE MOVE BY </p><p>THE PKK" </p><p> </p><p>REF:  STATE 208025 </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  REFTEL IS DEAD RIGHT TO SEEK ALL THE </p><p>INFORMATION WE CAN GET ON A PKK ATTACK ON U.S. FACILITIES </p><p>IN TURKEY.  IF WE FIND SYRIA IS INVOLVED, WE SHOULD </p><p>PROTEST HERE STRONGLY -- BARRING TURKISH OBJECTIONS TO </p><p>SUCH A U.S. MOVE.  BUT WE SEE SYRIA AS LARGELY -- IF NOT </p><p>ENTIRELY -- ABANDONING   TERRORISM FOR A VARIETY OF </p><p>REASONS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  PKK ATTACKS SUCH AS THE ONE ALLEGED IN THE TURKISH </p><p>PRESS ACCOUNT MENTIONED IN REFTEL MUST BE PURSUED BUT WE </p><p>NO LONGER REFLEXIVELY ASSUME THAT SYRIA PROMOTED OR </p><p>CONDONED THE ATTACK.  THE PKK HAS NOT BEEN TOTALLY </p><p>UPROOTED HERE LIKE ABU NIDAL, BUT IT HAS BEEN RESTRICTED. </p><p>IT WON\'T BE COMPLETELY UPROOTED, IN OUR VIEW.  KURDS FORM </p><p>ONE OF THE IMPORTANT MINORITIES OF SYRIA AND THE RULING </p><p>ALAWIS  HAVE REACHED OUT TO THEM -- AS TO MINORITY </p><p>CHRISTIANS, DRUZE AND ISMAILIS -- TO FORM THE COALITION </p><p>WHICH IS NEEDED TO OFFSET THE GREAT MAJORITY OF SYRIANS, </p><p>WHO ARE SUNNI ARABS, THE TRADITIONAL RULING CLASS.  KURDS </p><p>ARE THE LEAST PROMINENT PART OF THE COALITION,  PARTLY </p><p>BECAUSE THEY ARE SUNNI, AND ARE IN NO WAY IN A POSITION T </p><p>ASSERT A RIGHT TO CROSS-BORDER OPERATIONS WHICH COMPLICAT </p><p>SYRIAN RELATIONS WITH A RESURGENT TURKEY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  WE CONTINUE TO DOUBT THAT SYRIA IS ENCOURAGING, RATHE </p><p>THAN DISCOURAGING, ANY SUCH ATTACKS.  SYRIA HAS CLAMPED </p><p>DOWN ON ASALA -- THE ARMENIAN BISHOP HERE SAYS IT HAS </p><p>BEEN THROWN OUT -- AND HAS MOVED PKK CAMPS OUT OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY.  THE REASONS ARE MANY:  BLOWN OPERATIONS, </p><p>EUPHRATES WATER, A SKILLFUL TURKISH DIPLOMACY WHICH </p><p>COMBINES THE CARROT WITH THE STICK.  OPERATIONS CONTINUE, </p><p>BUT IRAQI AND IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR SUCH OPERATIONS -- TO </p><p>EMBARRASS SYRIA AND EMBROIL IT WITH TURKEY -- REMAIN </p><p>PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR US.  BUT WE MUST FOLLOW UP </p><p>SUCH GOSSAMER  POSSIBILITIES AS REFTEL - BUT - ALTHOUGH WE </p><p>HAVE A LEGITIMATE INTEREST IN RAISING KURDISH TERRORISM </p><p>AGAINST U.S. FACILITIES, THE TURKS WILL NOT RPT NOT </p><p>WELCOME OUR DOING SO WITH SYRIANS IN THE CASE OF PKK. </p><p>THE TURKS PROBABLY WILL WANT US NOT TO GET INVOLVED AT </p><p>ALL, IN FACT -- EVEN IF IT IS PROVED THAT THE ALLEGED PKK </p><p>ATTACKERS CAME FROM SYRIA. </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDERGIRDING THIS NOW IS OUR FEELING THAT A BROAD </p><p>AND DISPARATE NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENTS -- WITH THE WEST, </p><p>TURKEY, MODERATE ARABS, IRAQ, IRAN, AND THE DOMESTIC </p><p>ECONOMY HAVE FORCED A TURN-AROUND HERE ON TERRORISM.  EVE </p><p>SYRIA\'S MUCH PUBLICIZED SUPPORT FOR ITS OWN SUICIDE </p><p>BOMBERS IN SOUTH LEBANON HAS ALL BUT HALTED IN THE PAST </p><p>YEAR.  ASAD IS WEAK AND WANTS NO PROBLEMS WITH ISRAEL. </p><p>WE DON\'T EXPECT ATTACKS ON ISRAELI TARGETS TO BE </p><p>DISCARDED ENTIRELY; AFTER ALL, SMALL SCALE, DENIABLE </p><p>ATTACKS ARE THE WEAPON OF THE WEAK.  IN ADDITION, ASAD </p><p>BELIEVES HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO SUPPORT "NATIONAL </p><p>RESISTANCE" INSIDE ISRAELI-OCCUPIED TERRITORY AGAINST </p><p>CERTAIN TARGETS.  (THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR US.  THE ISRAELI </p><p>DEFINITION OF "TERRORISM" ON THE WEST BANK AND SOUTHERN </p><p>LEBANON APPEARS DIFFERENT FROM OURS -- UNDERSTANDABLY, </p><p>SINCE WE CHAMPION FOES OF OCCUPATION IN AFGHANISTAN, NIC- </p><p>ARAGUA, ANGOLA, CAMBODIA, AND ELSEWHERE, WHILE THE </p><p>ISRAELIS ARE OCCUPIERS WITH NO LARGE STAKE BEYOND THEIR </p><p>BORDER.)  THUS, ASAD MAY TOSS MOST PALESTINIANS OUT OF </p><p>DAMASCUS, BUT HE WILL HOLD OUT A REMNANT TO FRONT FOR </p><p>HIS TOTTERING POLICY OF "ARMED CONFRONTATION" WITH ISRAEL </p><p>HE SIMILARLY WANTS TO USE HIZBALLAHIS AGAINST ISRAEL\'S </p><p>OCCUPATION AND WON\'T HESITATE, WE THINK, TO TAKE ON </p><p>CERTAIN LEBANESE GROUPS WHICH PUSH HIM TOO FAR; THE </p><p>LEBANESE ARE WEAKER THAN SYRIA, AND USE TERRORISM EVERY </p><p>DAY THEMSELVES.  WITNESS KARAMI, AND MANY OTHERS OF EVERY </p><p>CONFESSION.  ANYWAY, SYRIA ISN\'T OUT OF THE TERRORISM </p><p>BUSINESS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ONLY TIME WILL TELL WHETHER ASAD HAS REDUCED </p><p>TERRORISM AS MUCH AS WE THINK.  "YOU WON\'T BELIEVE ME," </p><p>SHRUGGED ASAD, AFTER TELLING ONE AMERICAN VISITOR THAT </p><p>THERE WOULD BE NO TERRORIST OPERATION RUN OUT OF </p><p>SYRIA IN THE FUTURE, "BUT IT IS USEFUL TO SAY SO, TO </p><p>CLOSE THE DOSSIER."  WE MUST BE ALERT TO EVERY </p><p>INCIDENT--BUT NOT IGNORE THE SIGNS OF A BASIC CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RANSOM </p><p></p></div>
