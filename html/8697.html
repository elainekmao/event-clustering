<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 OTTAWA 001668 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR OES/IHA, OES/PCI, WHA/CAN (RUNNING) </p><p> </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR OSTP </p><p> </p><p>HHS FOR OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, OFFICE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (STEIGER) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TBIO, EAID, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: Canadians Pleased with President\'s AIDS </p><p>Initiative </p><p> </p><p>Ref.  SECSTATE 146483 </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Summary and Action Request </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. This cable contains an action request (para.9). </p><p> </p><p>2. ESTH Counselor and ESTH Specialist called on Ed </p><p>Aiston, Director General for International Affairs, and </p><p>Martin Methot, his deputy, in the Canadian Health </p><p>Ministry to discuss the President\'s AIDS initiative. </p><p>Aiston said the Canadian Government is very pleased </p><p>with the new USG funding to fight HIV/AIDS, and he </p><p>praised the leadership shown by the U.S. on this issue. </p><p>Aiston and Methot asked whether the new AIDS/HIV funds </p><p>will have any conditions on their disbursement, such as </p><p>a requirement for matching funds from host governments </p><p>or other sources.  Canadian financial commitments to </p><p>the global fight against AIDS/HIV amount to C$470 </p><p>million (about US$347 million) between 2000 and 2005. </p><p>The Canadian federal budget of February 2003 indicates </p><p>an 8 percent increase in the International Assistance </p><p>budget, and it is likely that AIDS/HIV funding will </p><p>receive a boost over the coming few years from this </p><p>source.  Aiston said that Secretary Thompson\'s </p><p>announcement of the new AIDS funding at the recent </p><p>World Health Assembly, along with the surprise USG </p><p>support for the adoption of the Framework Convention on </p><p>Tobacco Control, set the right tone for the recent </p><p>World Health Assembly and contributed significantly to </p><p>its success.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Canadians very pleased with USG AIDS Initiatives </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>3. Ed Aiston, Director General of International Affairs </p><p>at Health Canada was effusive in his praise for the new </p><p>USG funding initiative signed into law by the President </p><p>on May 27th.  Aiston noted that Secretary Thompson\'s </p><p>announcement of the new funds, made at the World Health </p><p>Assembly (WHA) in Geneva, was "very, very, very well- </p><p>received". </p><p> </p><p>4. Aiston, along with Martin Methot, Director of the </p><p>International Health Division at Health Canada posed </p><p>some questions to the EST Counselor and ESTH Specialist </p><p>regarding the new funds.  Specifically, Aiston and </p><p>Methot inquired whether USG funding for AIDS programs </p><p>will require matching funds from other donors or </p><p>whether any other conditions may apply.  Methot also </p><p>asked whether U.S. programs for AIDS included funds for </p><p>development of an AIDS vaccine.  Post would appreciate </p><p>any clarification that WASHDC agencies could provide on </p><p>these two questions.  See para.8. </p><p> </p><p>5. Aiston took the opportunity of the meeting with </p><p>Emboffs, to note that Secretary Thompson\'s support for </p><p>the adoption of the FCTC was extremely well-received by </p><p>the assembled Health Ministers at the WHA.  He praised </p><p>the Secretary\'s actions as a very strong example of </p><p>leadership, which generated enormous goodwill and </p><p>helped create a very positive tone for the Assembly. </p><p>Aiston remarked also that Secretary Thompson\'s </p><p>statement on the need for a strong and robust Global </p><p>Public Health Surveillance system was an idea that was </p><p>very well received at the WHA, and that Canada is eager </p><p>to learn more detail about this proposal. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>Canadian Funding for Global fight against AIDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>6. In the global fight against AIDS, Canada\'s </p><p>contribution, on a per capita basis, is significant. </p><p>Between 2000 and 2005 the GoC will invest C$270 million </p><p>(about US$198 million) in the global fight against </p><p>AIDS, via the Canadian International Development Agency </p><p>(CIDA), the Canadian equivalent of USAID.  CIDA </p><p>programs focus on working with community groups and </p><p>local organizations to provide reproductive health </p><p>services, training, education and counseling.  (CIDA </p><p>often contracts with Health Canada to execute their </p><p>programs, especially those involving capacity building </p><p>because Health Canada has 75 to 100 staff members with </p><p>clinical and public health expertise pertaining to </p><p>HIV/AIDS, whereas CIDA has only a small policy planning </p><p>staff managing the AIDS/HIV file.)  Methot told Embassy </p><p>officers that Canadian AIDS funds support programs in </p><p>India, China, Central and Eastern Europe, Africa and </p><p>the Caribbean. </p><p> </p><p>7. In addition, Canada has committed C$150 million </p><p>(about US$110 million) to the Global Fund to fight </p><p>AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.  The GoC has also </p><p>committed C$50 million (about US$37 million) to the </p><p>International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.  Canadian funds </p><p>have been used to build labs in Kenya and Uganda, with </p><p>additional labs planned for Rwanda, Zambia and </p><p>Cameroon. </p><p> </p><p>8. Aiston noted to Emboffs that the GoC Budget of </p><p>February 18th, 2003 indicated that the federal </p><p>government plans to increases Canada\'s International </p><p>Assistance budget by 8 per cent in FY2003-2004 and </p><p>again in FY 2004-05, this translates into an increase </p><p>of C$1.4 billion (about US$1 billion).  Aiston </p><p>anticipates that the GOC\'s AIDS funding will be </p><p>augmented as a result, but no details are yet </p><p>available.  Emboffs will be meeting with officials from </p><p>CIDA on June 19 to discuss CIDA\'s role in GoC AIDS/HIV </p><p>activities, and will seek their views on how much of </p><p>the new International Assistance funding will be </p><p>directed toward AIDS/HIV programs. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Action Request </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. Action request: Post would appreciate clarification </p><p>on whether under the President\'s initiative on AIDS, </p><p>the U.S. will require matching funds from other donors </p><p>or whether any other forms of conditionality may apply </p><p>to disbursement of the funds.  Canadian officials are </p><p>also interested in knowing to what extent the U.S. </p><p>provides funding for the AIDS vaccine initiative. </p><p>Response may be sent by email to ESTH Counselor Curt </p><p>Stone at stonec@state.gov or to ESTH Specialist </p><p>Locklear at locklearl@state.gov. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
