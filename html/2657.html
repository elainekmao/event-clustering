SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p></p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE MDC SHARPLY DEFINED ITS WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO ENGAGE IN FACILITATED DIALOGUE WITH ZANU-PF AS </p><p>LIMITED TO A TRANSITIONAL FORMULA TOWARD NEW ELECTIONS </p><p>AND REJECTED A UNITY GOVERNMENT.  THIS PUTS THEM ON A </p><p>CONFLICTING COURSE WITH ZANU-PF WHICH SEEKS TO FORCE MDC </p><p>AND THE NATION TO ACCEPT MUGABE\'S LEGITIMACY AS </p><p>PRESIDENT.  WE URGE DIRECT AND INDIRECT US EFFORTS TO </p><p>HIGHLIGHT AND PRESS FOR AN END TO STATE-SPONSORED </p><p>VIOLENT RETRIBUTION AGAINST OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MDC MP DAVID COLTART ASKED TO SEE THE BRITISH </p><p>HIGH COMMISSIONER AND THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR THE </p><p>EVENING OF MARCH 19 TO BRIEF ON RESULTS OF THE MDC </p><p>NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETING HELD THAT DAY. </p><p>COLTART SAID THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS UNITED IN OPPOSITION </p><p>TO MDC PARTICIPATION IN A NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT. </p><p>GRASSROOTS SENTIMENT WAS EXTREMELY STRONG BECAUSE PEOPLE </p><p>IN THE COUNTRYSIDE WERE BEING BEATEN UP AND KILLED BY </p><p>ZANU-PF, THE ARMED FORCES AND THE POLICE FOR HAVING </p><p>SUPPORTED THE MDC.  THE REQUIREMENT TO PUBLISH THE NAMES </p><p>AND ADDRESSES OF MDC POLLING AGENTS WAS NOW BEING USED </p><p>AS A WAY TO PERSECUTE AND PUNISH MDC SUPPORTERS. </p><p>COLTART SAID THAT SHOULD THE MDC LEADERSHIP SEEK TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN A UNITY GOVERNMENT, THEIR FOLLOWERS WOULD </p><p>REVOLT.  MDC ANALYSIS WAS THAT PRESIDENTS MUGABE WAS </p><p>SEEKING TO BUY TIME BY ENTERING "RECONCILIATION TALKS" </p><p>IN THE HOPE THAT PRESSURE ON HIM WOULD BE RELIEVED AND </p><p>HE WOULD GET SOME FOOD, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND FUEL </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN RETURN.  MDC BELIEVED THAT PRESIDENT MBEKI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00731  01 OF 02  201318Z </p><p>HAD HIS OWN REASONS FOR BUYING TIME TO PUT OFF A CRISIS </p><p>AND DIMINISH PRESSURE ON SOUTH AFRICA TO RESOLVE THE </p><p>CRISIS. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) COLTART SAID THAT MDC WOULD ENTER INTO </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS BEING ENCOURAGED BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>PRESIDENTS ONLY IF THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE BASED ON THE </p><p>FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES: </p><p> </p><p>-- THEY WOULD BE HELD UNDER THE MEDIATION OF AN </p><p>ACCEPTABLE NEUTRAL AFRICAN.  THE MDC LATER TOLD THE </p><p>NIGERIAN HC THAT THEY COULD NOT ACCEPT CHIEF SHONEKAN\'S </p><p>DESIGNATION IN THAT ROLE BECAUSE OF HIS ACCEPTANCE OF </p><p>THE ELECTION RESULT.  PRESIDENT OBASSANJO INSTEAD NAMED </p><p>PROFESSOR ADEDEJE(SPELLING ?), WHO SERVED FOR TEN YEARS </p><p>AS REPRESENTATIVE TO THE ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR AFRICA </p><p>IN ADDIS.) </p><p> </p><p>-- MBEKI AND OBASSANJO MUST COMMIT TO A FINITE, TIME- </p><p>LIMITED NEGOTIATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE GOZ MUST RELEASE ALL MDC SUPPORTERS ARRESTED </p><p>DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND SUSPEND PROSECUTION OF </p><p>MDC LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE OBJECTIVE OF NEGOTIATIONS IS NOT A UNITY </p><p>GOVERNMENT, BUT A GOVERNMENT OF TRANSITION FOR NO MORE </p><p>THAN SIX MONTHS LEADING TO NEW ELECTIONS HELD UNDER </p><p>UNITED NATIONS OR COMMONWEALTH AUSPICES AND HELD UNDER </p><p>THE NORMS AND STANDARDS FOR ELECTIONS SET FORTH BY THE </p><p>SADC-PARLIAMENTARY FORUM. (COLTART, A LAWYER, SAID THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00731  01 OF 02  201318Z </p><p>NO CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION WAS NECESSARY SINCE PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE HAD FREQUENTLY DEMONSTRATED THAT HE COULD DECREE </p><p>ANYTHING HE WISHED WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE PARLIAMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>-- MINISTERS IN SUCH A TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE </p><p>DIVIDED IN PROPORTION TO THE RESULTS OF THE 2000 </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION(ALMOST EVENLY SPLIT) AND EACH </p><p>SIDE\'S MINISTERS SHALL BE CHOSEN BY THEIR OWN </p><p>PARTY.(THIS TO BLOCK THE ONGOING ZANU-PF EFFORT TO PICK </p><p>OFF JUNIOR MDC PARLIAMENTARIANS AND ENTICE THEM INTO </p><p>ZANU-PF.) </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COLTART SAID THAT THE MDC WOULD SUPPORT THE </p><p>ZIMBABWE CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS(ZCTU) CALL FOR A </p><p>THREE-DAY STAY-AWAY MARCH 20-22 BECAUSE IT WAS IMPORTANT </p><p>TO MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON THE GOZ. HE SAID THAT </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS AND MASS ACTION NEEDED TO BE MAINTAINED. </p><p>BUT HE SAID THAT TSVANGIRAI HAD CAUTIONED HIS OWN </p><p>RADICALS TO AVOID VIOLENCE, WHICH WOULD BE USED TO </p><p>REPRESS THEM.  COLTART NOTED THAT THE NEW PUBLIC ORDER </p><p>AND SECURITY ACT SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED "STAY-AWAYS" </p><p>AND THE POSSIBILITY OF CONFRONTATION WAS HIGH.  HE ALSO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8832 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00731  02 OF 02  201319Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00   USNW-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      DS-00    VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    VCE-00   M-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   SSO-00   SS-00    DSCC-00  DRL-02 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /004W </p><p>                  ------------------77F3D8  201319Z /38 </p><p>O 201304Z MAR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1280 </p><p>INFO USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ABUJA PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000731 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/FO AND AF/S, DRL FOR A/S CRANER, S/WCI FOR </p><p>AMBASSADOR PROSPER </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR AFRICA SR DIR FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MDC WILL ONLY TALK TRANSITION </p><p> </p><p>SAID THAT IF PARTICIPATION WAS HIGH, IT MIGHT CONTINUE </p><p>BEYOND THE THREE DAYS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COLTART ASKED FOR ASSURANCES THAT THE UK AND US </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00731  02 OF 02  201319Z </p><p>WERE NOT PUSHING A UNITY GOVERNMENT, BUT TRANSITION TO A </p><p>NEW ELECTION, ASSURANCES WHICH WE PROVIDED.  HE ALSO </p><p>EXPRESSED EXTREME DISTRUST THAT MUGABE WAS USING TIME- </p><p>TESTED METHODS OF SEEKING TO CRUSH OR ABSORB THE MDC BY </p><p>A COMBINATION OF PERSECUTION AND INCORPORATION OF TOKEN </p><p>MDC ELEMENTS.  HE ASKED FOR PRESSURE THROUGH MBEKI AND </p><p>OBASSANJO IN PARTICULAR FOR AN END TO THE POLICY OF </p><p>RETRIBUTION AGAINST MDC SUPPORTERS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. </p><p>HE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THE UK OR ANOTHER SIGNATORY </p><p>COUNTRY SURFACE THE POSSIBLIITY OF INVOKING THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE. (US IS NOT A </p><p>SIGNATORY.) </p><p> </p><p>6. COMMENT: ZANU HAS BEEN USING HEAVY PUBLIC PRESSURE </p><p>DIRECTLY AND THROUGH AFRICAN FRIENDS TO GET THE MDC TO </p><p>BUY INTO A RECONCILIATION PROCESS WHICH LEGITIMATES </p><p>MUGABE\'S VICTORY AND RELIEVES PRESSURE ON THE GOZ FROM </p><p>THE BAD ELECTION PROCESS.  FORMAL CHARGES AGAINST </p><p>TSVANGIRAI ON MARCH 20, HARASSMENT AND RETRIBUTION </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AGAINST MDC SUPPORTERS AND HEAVY-HANDED RHETORIC ABOUT </p><p>THE MDC\'S NEED TO BE PATRIOTIC ARE ALL PART OF THAT </p><p>PRESSURE.  THE ALWAYS HEAVY-HANDED INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO WAS AT IT AGAIN IN A MARCH 20 </p><p>"HERALD" ARTICLE, SAYING THAT TSVANGIRAI IS SOUNDING </p><p>LIKE A CRIMINAL (IN CALLING FOR AN ELECTION RE-RUN) </p><p>BENT ON SUBVERTING ZIMBABWE\'S CONSTITUTION AND LAWS. </p><p>(REF B) THUS, THE AGENDAS FOR ZANU-PF AND THE MDC ARE </p><p>RADICALLY DIFFERENT WITH ZANU-PF OFFERING A FEW CRUMBS </p><p>AT MOST AND MDC SEEKING A NEW ELECTION. THE NIGERIANS </p><p>AND SOUTH AFRICANS PLAN TO BEGIN THE PROCESS ON </p><p>THURSDAY, BUT WILL HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY RECONCILING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00731  02 OF 02  201319Z </p><p>THE TWO WILDLY DIFFERENT AGENDAS. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>7. ACTION REQUESTS: 1.) WE RECOMMEND THAT WE DO </p><p>EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO HIGHLIGHT AND BRING PRESSURE </p><p>AGAINST THE GOZ\'S CAMPAIGN OF POST-ELECTION REPRESSION, </p><p>INCLUDING URGING THE NIGERIANS AND SOUTH AFRICANS TO </p><p>BRING PRESSURE ON THE GOZ.  2.) WE ASK WHETHER THE </p><p>DEPARTMENT CAN OPEN OR STIMULATE THE OPENING A PUBLIC </p><p>INVESTIGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MANY ACTS OF </p><p>MURDERS, BEATINGS, TORTURE AND RAPE REPORTED IN THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESS AND MANY ELECTION OBSERVER REPORTS </p><p>DURING THE PRE- AND NOW POST-ELECTION PERIODS. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
