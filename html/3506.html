<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001839 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, INR/R/MR </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KMDR, KPAO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Retaliatory sanctions welcome" the </p><p>      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" dedicated its </p><p>      August 14 editorial to backing Mr. Robert Mugabe\'s </p><p>      "retaliatory sanctions" against the United States, European </p><p>      Union and other Western countries that have imposed travel </p><p>      restrictions on Mugabe\'s administration.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "There is an adage that says: if you sow wind, you </p><p>      reap the whirlwind, and when this happens, you will </p><p>      have only yourself to blame.  The European Union and </p><p>      the United States have imposed what they prefer to </p><p>      call smart sanctions on 72 senior government and </p><p>      ZANU PF officials for giving land to the black </p><p>      majority. . .What these nations forgot was that they </p><p>      have no monopoly in imposing sanctions against any </p><p>      nation, no matter how small it might be. . .We </p><p>      welcome the President\'s announcement and hope that </p><p>      it will send the right message to the British and </p><p>      their MDC messengers who appear to be basking in the </p><p>      misguided notion that they are immune to </p><p>      sanctions. . .Zimbabwe is not a punch bag for </p><p>      bullies from the Western world who, while preaching </p><p>      democracy, have autocratic foreign policies. </p><p>      President Mugabe has already made it clear that the </p><p>      time to hit back has come and we hope that those who </p><p>      got the ball rolling will not cry foul when we </p><p>      retaliate. . .The Tony Blairs and the George Bushes </p><p>      of this world need to be reminded that Zimbabwe is </p><p>      no longer a colony that is told what to do at every </p><p>      turn.  They should leave the country\'s leaders to go </p><p>      about their business in this global village without </p><p>      hindrance." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
