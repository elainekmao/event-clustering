<p>S E C R E T ABU DHABI 002170 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP AND NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  ADNAN PACHACHI IS BAGHDAD BOUND </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Former Iraqi foreign minister Adnan Pachachi </p><p>contacted the Ambassador over the local weekend </p><p>with the news that he will be flying into Baghdad </p><p>on Tuesday, May 6 aboard a UAE Air Force C-130 with </p><p>a small group of his supporters.  MFA Minstate </p><p>Hamdan bin Zayid and Armed Forces Chief of Staff </p><p>Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid separately told the </p><p>Ambassador that the UAEG is supporting the </p><p>establishment of an office for Pachachi in Baghdad </p><p>and providing him with security, until he has set- </p><p>up his own Iraqi security detail. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Comment:  Pachachi believes he has much to </p><p>contribute in the evolving dialogue on the future </p><p>Iraqi government.  The octogenarian statesman has </p><p>spent the last several weeks touring various Arab </p><p>capitals briefing leaders, including Hosni Mubarak </p><p>and King Abdullah, on his vision, and soliciting </p><p>their advice.  Here in Abu Dhabi, where he has </p><p>resided with his wife since the early 1970s, </p><p>Pachachi has been hosting informal diwans where </p><p>Iraqi expats of all stripes have been airing their </p><p>concerns about the current state of affairs and </p><p>presenting suggestions on how to shape the new </p><p>government.  For the Emiratis, Pachachi\'s </p><p>moderation, his message of inclusion and his strong </p><p>pan-Arab credentials are an important balance to </p><p>what they view as the alarming emergence of Shi\'a </p><p>sectarianism coupled with signs of Iranian meddling </p><p>in Iraqi affairs.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
