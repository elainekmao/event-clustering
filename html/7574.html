<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0114 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          APRIL 21, 2003 </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for April 21, 2003.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Bolge: A visible decrease is seen in the </p><p>number of US military vehicles and equipment </p><p>deployed at Iskenderun port as more of them are </p><p>being sent back to other destinations.  A </p><p>freighter named "Cape Ducato" docked at the port </p><p>yesterday for onward shipment of US military </p><p>vehicles and equipment.  The part of the port </p><p>known as the "chrome area" has been totally </p><p>cleared of military equipment.  A group of US </p><p>military officials and Turkish port authorities </p><p>are working on an inventory to assess the </p><p>maintenance, repair, and renovation works made at </p><p>the port. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Bolge: Following the ending of Operation </p><p>Northern Watch (ONW), some of the US troops </p><p>deployed at Incirlik AFB have already left the </p><p>country, and the ones who have remained are </p><p>conducting war-games exercises for security </p><p>purposes.  The ONW mission deployed at Incirlik </p><p>AFB was jointly fulfilled by US and British </p><p>troops with a December 25, 1996 decision by the </p><p>Turkish National Assembly, and ended on March 19, </p><p>2003.  During the scheduled exercises, gas-masked </p><p>and armed US soldiers defended hangers </p><p>successfully against possible attacks.  Turkiye </p><p>reported that Washington was going to minimize </p><p>its military presence in Turkey and Jordan, and </p><p>planned to establish four permanent military </p><p>bases in Iraq while evacuating Incirlik AFB. </p><p>Thus, the US aimed to control the Middle East, </p><p>Southeastern Asia, and the Indian Ocean from the </p><p>Mediterranean against potential threats. </p><p>Accoringtothi pan,th USwll set up its </p><p>new air bases in Baghdad, Tali in outher </p><p>Nairiye,the Bahur reio innothrn ra, ad </p><p>aoter nein thedesertregionto conrol oil </p><p>pipes close to Jordan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Evrensel: Zehra Barin, a women with three </p><p>children who was seriously wounded as a result of </p><p>an explosion of a land mine while picking wild </p><p>cardoons (an edible root plant) in a village of </p><p>Sirnak, died at the university hospital in </p><p>Diyarbakir.  Mrs. Barin said she was picking </p><p>cardoons during the early morning in a fenced </p><p>area where some villagers were grazing their </p><p>cows.  She said her three-year-old nephew </p><p>accompanied her and she thought soldiers would </p><p>warn them if that area had been a military zone. </p><p>Her husband, Nurettin Barin, said that although </p><p>they were made to wait at two jandarma stations, </p><p>one in the village and another one at Kasrik </p><p>Pass, for a total of about two hours, her health </p><p>worsened after she was given anesthesia at the </p><p>hospital.  The President of HRA\'s Diyarbakir </p><p>Chapter, Selahattin Demirtas, held the military </p><p>responsible for the land mines, and said they </p><p>would conduct the necessary investigations and </p><p>would apply to the European Human Rights Court </p><p>after all the domestic legal avenues had been </p><p>exhausted.  He added that the problem of land </p><p>mines would not diminish unless the Kurdish issue </p><p>was resolved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Milliyet/Evrensel/Bolge/Cumhuriyet/Sabah/Hur </p><p>riyet: The Governor of Hatay, Ismet Gurbuz </p><p>Civelek, passed away due to a heart attack he had </p><p>in Izmir yesterday. His body was sent to Ankara </p><p>for burial. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Turkiye/Cumhuriyet: A mysterious e-mail </p><p>dated March 11, 2003 from Germany, which read </p><p>"Only 70 days are left for the happening of the </p><p>most important event in 2003," put the Turkish </p><p>National Police (TNP) and other intelligence </p><p>units on alert.  The security officials believe </p><p>that the message hinted a likely terrorist </p><p>attack. Taking the e-mail message into account, </p><p>an Anti-Terror Directorate circular ordered the </p><p>related security agencies to revise their </p><p>protections for primarily the airports and other </p><p>sensitive buildings and facilities, and be </p><p>extremely vigilant during and after May 19, the </p><p>National Sports and Youth Day. It is speculated </p><p>that the Islamist radical group in Germany known </p><p>as "Kaplancilar" may have sent the message. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Evrensel:  According to the studies made by </p><p>Woman\'s Status and Problems (WSP), and Woman\'s </p><p>Social Status Research and Examination </p><p>Association, the difficulty of being a women in </p><p>Turkey varied from region to region. The result </p><p>of research conducted in 19 provinces revealed </p><p>that 45.8 percent of women have not enjoyed any </p><p>education at all, 4.3 percent have left school </p><p>without completing their elementary school </p><p>education, while only 33.5 percent had completed </p><p>the five-year compulsory elementary schooling. </p><p>Of the educated women in Turkey, 81 percent are </p><p>graduates of junior high schools, 5.8 percent of </p><p>senior high schools and only 2.6 percent are of </p><p>universities.  Thirty-nine point six (39.6) </p><p>percent of educated women between the ages of 15 </p><p>and 24 are unemployed nationwide.  The ratio of </p><p>unemployed women in urban centers is reported to </p><p>be around 37.4 percent while it is 45.3 percent </p><p>in rural areas. The Secretary for Teachers Union </p><p>Women\'s Organization, Senay Ozmen, said the main </p><p>problem the women faced in the region was that </p><p>the girls were not sent to schools for education, </p><p>and remarked that the economic and social </p><p>dimensions of the issue were parallel.  Because </p><p>the girls were married at a very young age, they </p><p>were deprived of their rights, and the girls </p><p>constituted 2/3rds of the uneducated children in </p><p>Turkey.  Ms. Ozmen said the girls were used in </p><p>the fields and gardens in the rural areas, and </p><p>because of that they were unable to express </p><p>themselves in any subject and unable even to help </p><p>their children when they got married. As a </p><p>sample, she said, 51 percent of Diyarbakir\'s </p><p>population was made up of males, and the </p><p>education ratio among them was 30 percent while </p><p>this ratio was 19 percent among the female </p><p>inhabitants.  Finally, she said that development </p><p>could not take place unless regional differences </p><p>were eradicated. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
