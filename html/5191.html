<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 TEGUCIGALPA 000131 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>GUATEMALA FOR COMATT: DTHOMPSON </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EINV, ECON, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: MINISTRY OF TOURISM BUILDS ON HONDURAS\' STRENGTHS </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary.  President Maduro came into office intent on </p><p>nurturing the fledgling tourism industry in Honduras.   By </p><p>tapping successful businessman (and Maduro cousin) Thierry </p><p>de Pierrefeu to serve as Tourism Ministry, he assured that </p><p>there would be a no-nonsense business approach to this </p><p>priority sector.  Pierrefeu has, in fact, focused on the key </p><p>problems highlighted in Embassy\'s previous reporting on the </p><p>tourism sector, at the end of the Flores administration (see </p><p>reftels).  He is focusing on marketing by advertising </p><p>integrated tourism products (Caribbean vacations, Mayan </p><p>ruins, and eco-tourism), opening tourism promotion offices </p><p>in the U.S and a website, and seeking strategic partners. </p><p>Juridical and personal security are being addressed with </p><p>land titling projects and tourism police units. </p><p>Infrastructure projects include plans for an airport in </p><p>Copan, enhancements to attract the cruise ship trade in </p><p>Roatan, and tourist information centers in inland tourist </p><p>destinations.  A new Honduran airline, Sol Air, has helped </p><p>bring down airfares from the U.S. and Central America, and </p><p>Pierrefeu is urging new routes by U.S. airlines as well. </p><p>Honduras still faces stiff competition for the tourism </p><p>trade, but the GOH does appear to be on the right track. </p><p>End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Ministry of Tourism has an annual budget of 156.6 </p><p>million dollars.  It has designated 194 million lempira </p><p>(11.5 million dollars) for projects already approved.  By </p><p>moving more towards environmentally friendly tourism </p><p>projects, exploiting Honduras\' natural resources, flora and </p><p>fauna, and concentrating on "High End Luxury Tours," the </p><p>Ministry hopes to increase visitors by 20 percent yearly, </p><p>and introduce an anticipated increase to Honduras\' economy </p><p>of 350 million dollars. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) President Maduro and his cabinet have designated </p><p>tourism as one of a small number of priority sectors likely </p><p>to create a substantial number of jobs and economic growth. </p><p>The Ministry of Tourism\'s strategies to increase tourism </p><p>include </p><p> -- Developing tourism products for high end visitors </p><p>(quality vacations versus quantity of visitors) </p><p> -- Creating a national cadaster with an actual folio real </p><p>to improve the investment climate for foreign investment, </p><p>building on the only experience gained in surveying the Bay </p><p>Islands </p><p> -- Drafting a convention between Honduras and Guatemala </p><p>(and other central American countries) to allow for a more </p><p>free flow of visitors to the various Maya ruins sites to </p><p>meet the demands of tourists </p><p> -- Increasing the number of cruise ship docks on the </p><p>Atlantic coast; the inauguration of an expected dock on the </p><p>island of Roatan is already resulting in a large increase in </p><p>the number of tourists </p><p> -- Constructing a new airstrip near the Copan ruins to </p><p>allow for day-trips for cruise line passengers from Roatan </p><p> -- Implementing a new tourist police force, this has </p><p>already been accomplished in the cities of Tela and La Ceiba </p><p> -- Opening Honduran markets internationally via the </p><p>internet (www.letsgohonduras.com) </p><p> -- Reforming the Tourism Incentives Law which allows for </p><p>the approval of 43 hotel projects, various restaurants, </p><p>recreation centers and car rental centers </p><p> -- Building municipal tourist centers in the western, </p><p>southern and central parts of Honduras, to complement the </p><p>existing tourist attractions on the north coast </p><p> -- Developing alternate sources of income for rural areas </p><p>with high ecotourism potential </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Pierrefeu, (a businessman, cousin of the President </p><p>and organizer of the inauguration) has directed his staff to </p><p>focus on three clear project goals.  Each of these projects, </p><p>referred to as "tourism products" contains several smaller </p><p>clusters of projects.  These products are titled "A </p><p>Caribbean Creation", "Maya Renaissance", and "Tropical </p><p>Nature Adventure." None of the projects will be marketed for </p><p>high-density tourism. The GOH is trying to promote what </p><p>Pierrefeu calls high quality, sustainable tourism. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>A Carribean Creation </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The Caribbean Creation project involves encouraging </p><p>tourism development in the Bay Islands and the northern </p><p>coast of Honduras, focusing on beaches and reefs.  There are </p><p>plans to build two thousand hotel rooms in Tela Bay and to </p><p>promote La Ceiba as an ecotourism center with the already </p><p>strong infrastructure of airports, hotels and national </p><p>parks. For the Tela and La Ceiba areas, the goal is a mid to </p><p>low-density crowd based on eco-tourism as well as the north </p><p>coast beaches. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) The goal for the Bay Islands is to develop very high- </p><p>end (costly) low-density tourism with new resorts that have </p><p>a more intimate ambiance such as the proposed Caribe Point </p><p>Rosewood and Ritz Carlton projects set for Roatan.  The </p><p>Caribe Point Rosewood will require an estimated investment </p><p>of over USD 47 million.  The Ritz Carlton is looking to </p><p>develop a private resort with personalized bungalows set </p><p>along a winding river so that each cabin has a private deck </p><p>and swimming area.  A German chain is planning a similar </p><p>exclusive resort called Iguana Bay on Guanaja Island. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Maya Renaissance </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) This project is about Honduras\' wealth of archaeology </p><p>and consists of a complete Mayan Route from Copan to other </p><p>lesser known ruins and archaeological sites.  It will be </p><p>geared towards a mid-density eco-tourism crowd. A primary </p><p>improvement in the infrastructure of the area is a new, </p><p>(unpaved) runway near the Copan ruins that will allow local </p><p>commuter airlines to transport tourists from Guatemala and </p><p>Roatan (targeted at the cruise ship tourists) for visits to </p><p>the ruins at Copan.  The Ministry has plans to eventually </p><p>construct an airport nearby to replace the airport that was </p><p>closed due to its damaging proximity to the ancient ruins. </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) As for the south coast of Honduras, the Ministry has </p><p>plans for improvements in Ampala, Cedeo, Punta Raton and </p><p>Choluteca.  Choluteca will be part of a "Colonial Route" </p><p>consisting of Gracias, Santa Rosa de Copan, Comayaqua, </p><p>Tegucigalpa and Choluteca. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Tropical Nature Adventure </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) Tropical Nature Adventure includes the marketing and </p><p>developing of eco-tourism on the north shore, in the </p><p>national parks and in the Copan ruins area.  The Ministry is </p><p>also exploring an extension of eco-tourism towards high-end </p><p>clients who wish to participate in scientific exploration. </p><p>On a recent trip to New York, Ministry representatives met </p><p>with people from the World Wildlife Federation, the </p><p>Smithsonian, the Audubon, and Conservancy International and </p><p>Counterpart International (the last two work together in </p><p>unified projects) and National Geographic.  All responded </p><p>favorably to the idea of participating in field studies in </p><p>Honduras which will certify the quality of Honduras\' natural </p><p>attractions. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>Honduras\' Crown of Five Ecotourism Jewels </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) The five ecotourism attractions in Honduras include </p><p>the dolphin zone, the coral zone, the Quetzal zone, the </p><p>Liquid mbar zone (Liquid mbar refers to a tree resin), and </p><p>the Pipante (a small native canoe) zone.  Each of these five </p><p>fits into one of the Ministry\'s aforementioned three main </p><p>projects. </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) The dolphin zone includes the north coast from the </p><p>city of Trujillo westward to Puerto Cortes.  The principal </p><p>tourist attractions include the national park "Janet Kawas" </p><p>and the botanical gardens in Tela; the wilderness reserves </p><p>around the Cuero and Salado rivers and the national park </p><p>"Pico Bonito" in La Ceiba. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) The coral zone is also associated with the Carribean </p><p>Creation, consisting of the three main islands of Utila, </p><p>Roatan and Guanaja in Honduras\' Bay Islands.  The islands </p><p>contain the second largest coral reef in the world, second </p><p>only to the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia. </p><p>Main attractions include the Marine Reserve at Sandy Bay, </p><p>the Institute of Marine Science and the Roatan Museum, along </p><p>with the marine reserves in West End and Turtle Harbor. </p><p> </p><p>13. (U) The Quetzal zone relates to archaeology - Maya Route </p><p>project and covers the western part of Honduras.  It </p><p>encompasses the Copan ruins, and sites from Lake Yojoa to </p><p>Omoa.  The zone includes the key economic city of San Pedro </p><p>Sula and Honduras\' principal port city, Puerto Cortes.  Main </p><p>attractions include the nightlife of San Pedro Sula, the </p><p>national park "El Cusco", Pulhapanzak waterfalls, the ruins </p><p>of Copan and Lake Yojoa, Honduras\' largest freshwater lake. </p><p> </p><p>14. (U) Within the context of the Tropical Nature Adventure </p><p>project, the Liquidambar zone encompasses the central region </p><p>of Honduras, including the principal areas of Tegucigalpa, </p><p>San Lorenzo and the Gulf of Fonseca.  The Gulf area includes </p><p>several small volcanic islands stretching up into well known </p><p>mountain peaks such as the cloud forest called "La Tigra" </p><p>near Tegucigalpa and the well known mountainous coastal area </p><p>of "Zacate Grande" near Choluteca in the south. </p><p> </p><p>15. (U) The last "jewel", definitely for the dedicated </p><p>nature adventure lover, is the Pipante zone.  Named after </p><p>the small canoe typically used by the locals, the areas of </p><p>Olancho and Gracias a Dios are known as the most bio-diverse </p><p>regions in the country.  Here, the largest and most </p><p>developed protected areas such as the biosphere of the Rio </p><p>Platano are the main attraction.  This is where the most </p><p>adventurous tourists will seek to vacation. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Encouraging Foreign Investment </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16. (U) In order to better attract foreign investment, the </p><p>Tourism Ministry has pushed for a new land titling </p><p>initiative.  As part of an IDB (Inter-American Development </p><p>Bank) project on sustainable development, three </p><p>international companies worked with the GOH to complete </p><p>surveys of the Bay Islands via satellite, airplanes, and </p><p>global positioning system (GPS) technologies.  They made </p><p>topographical maps and a computerized registry of every </p><p>piece of property in the islands.  The GOH believes this </p><p>will simplify future land purchases, ensure future </p><p>undisputed ownership rights to land (an important </p><p>consideration for foreign investors such as hotel and resort </p><p>entrepreneurs), and fortify the municipalities\' ability to </p><p>collect local taxes. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Protecting Honduras\' Visitors </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17. (U) In an attempt to better ensure the safety of </p><p>Honduras\' visitors, the development of a tourism police </p><p>force is underway.  The first unit was created in the city </p><p>of Tela.  Within the next six months, the Ministry intends </p><p>to activate units in the Bay Islands, La Ceiba and La Tigra </p><p>National Park in Tegucigalpa.  Units in Copan and the Copan- </p><p>San Pedro Sula route will follow shortly thereafter. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (U) Comment: Pierrefeu brings a fresh business </p><p>perspective into the arena of tourism planning which gives </p><p>him a different perspective on investments than former </p><p>tourism heads.  Pierrefeu reports that the number of </p><p>tourists is at its highest level ever with thirty six </p><p>percent of the tourists coming from the U.S.  In order to </p><p>increase that number to fifty percent, Pierrefeu\'s staff is </p><p>working to build alliances with US travel agencies such as </p><p>Conde Nast and American Express.  They are also opening new </p><p>tourism promotion offices in Washington, Houston, San </p><p>Francisco and Chicago to compliment the office already </p><p>servicing Miami.  The Minister has found his job to be more </p><p>challenging than expected, but is determined to continue </p><p>finding new, innovative ways to attract additional tourism </p><p>to Honduras.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
