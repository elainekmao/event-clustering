<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 001680 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE PLEASE PASS OPIC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, BEXP, EFIN, ELTN, PGOV, PBTS, HR, Refugee </p><p>SUBJECT: REFUGEE RETURN ISSUES AND OPIC ROAD FINANCE; THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR CALLS ON RECONSTRUCTION MINISTER CACIC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR RALPH FRANK FOR REASONS 1.5 (B), AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>    SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON JULY 21, THE AMBASSADOR PAID AN INTRODUCTORY CALL </p><p>ON RADOMIR CACIC, CROATIA\'S MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS, </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD CACIC HE </p><p>WAS PLEASED WITH RECENT GOC INITIATIVES AIMED AT SPEEDING UP </p><p>THE PACE OF REFUGEE RETURNS.  HE ENCOURAGED CACIC AND HIS </p><p>MINISTRY TO MOVE FORWARD ON OTHER KEY ELEMENTS INCLUDING </p><p>REPOSSESSION AND RECONSTRUCTION.  REGARDING THE STATUS OF AN </p><p>OPIC GUARANTEE FOR FINANCING OF A HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION </p><p>PROJECT, THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT THE GUARANTEE WAS </p><p>STILL UNDER REVIEW IN WASHINGTON.  CACIC REACTED STRONGLY TO </p><p>THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE GUARANTEE MIGHT NOT BE APPROVED. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>PROGRESS ON RETURNS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) IN HIS INTRODUCTORY CALL ON JULY 21, THE AMBASSADOR, </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY USAID DIRECTOR, TOLD MINISTER CACIC THAT </p><p>REFUGEE RETURNS REMAIN AN IMPORTANT CONCERN IN THE REGION FOR </p><p>THE USG.  THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED SATISFACTION THAT THE GOC </p><p>HAD MADE GREAT STRIDES IN RECENT MONTHS IN APPROVING POLICIES </p><p>RELATED TO REFUGEE RETURNS.  THE GOC\'S MOST RECENT </p><p>INITIATIVE, ANNOUNCED ON JUNE 12, AIMED AT PROVIDING A </p><p>HOUSING SOLUTION TO THOSE WHO LOST TENANCY RIGHTS DURING THE </p><p>WAR WAS ALSO WELCOME.  THE AMBASSADOR URGED THE GOC TO FOCUS </p><p>ITS ATTENTION NOW ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW POLICY IN </p><p>ORDER TO PRODUCE QUICK RESULTS.  AS THE EU AND NATO GAUGE </p><p>CROATIA\'S PROGRESS TOWARD MEMBERSHIP, THEY WILL BASE THEIR </p><p>    JUDGMENTS ONLY ON RESULTS ON THE GROUND, NOT GOVERNMENT </p><p>ANNOUNCEMENTS.  THE AMBASSADOR ALSO URGED THE GOC TO EXPEDITE </p><p>THE PACE OF OTHER KEY MEASURES ALREADY UNDERWAY, ESPECIALLY </p><p>THE REPOSSESSION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF PROPERTY. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CACIC THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS ASSESSMENT, </p><p>SAYING IT WAS "RIGHT ON THE MARK."  HE SAID THAT HIS MINISTRY </p><p>IS FOCUSING ITS ATTENTION ON IMPLEMENTATION, WHICH HAS BEEN </p><p>SLOWED SOMEWHAT BY THE LACK OF PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES. </p><p> FINANCES WERE NOT A PROBLEM.  CACIC TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT </p><p>5,000 TO 7,000 HOUSES WILL BE BUILT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. </p><p>HE CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, THAT ONLY A SMALL PORTION (ABOUT </p><p>5,000) OF THE ALMOST 20,000 APPLICANTS WILL QUALIFY FOR </p><p>HOUSING ASSISTANCE.  MANY OF THE APPLICANTS DO NOT MEET THE </p><p>CRITERIA AND WILL NOT RECEIVE A POSITIVE DECISION. </p><p>REPOSSESSION OF PROPERTY IS PROCEEDING SMOOTHLY.  HE </p><p>PREDICTED THAT ONLY ABOUT 1,500 CASES, OUT OF A TOTAL OF </p><p>20,000, WILL NOT BE RESOLVED BY THE END OF THE YEAR.  THE </p><p>OWNERS OF THOSE PROPERTIES WILL BE PAID RENT UNTIL THEY </p><p>ASSUME CONTROL OF THEIR PROPERTY.  THE HOME IMPROVEMENT LOAN </p><p>PROGRAM BACKED BY USAID CREDIT GUARANTEE WILL HAVE A BIG </p><p>IMPACT ON HELPING RESOLVE THE HOUSING ISSUE, SAID CACIC. </p><p> </p><p>NO DECISION ON OPIC FINANCING </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) RESPONDING TO A JULY 17 QUERY TO THE EMBASSY ABOUT THE </p><p>ISSUE OF AN OPIC GUARANTEE OF CROATIAN SOVEREIGN DEBT FOR A </p><p>HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, THE AMBASSADOR TOLD CACIC SAID </p><p>THAT THE GUARANTEE PROPOSAL WAS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION IN </p><p>WASHINGTON.  THIS WAS PART OF THE INTERAGENCY PROCESS, AND A </p><p>    FINAL DECISION WAS AT LEAST SEVERAL WEEKS AWAY.  THE DELAY </p><p>WAS NOT CROATIA-SPECIFIC.  SINCE APPROVAL WAS NOT GUARANTEED, </p><p>ALL OPTIONS SHOULD STILL BE LEFT OPEN.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>REITERATED THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS HIGHWAY </p><p>PROJECT IN OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) CACIC REACTED STRONGLY TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S SUGGESTION. </p><p> HE SAID THAT BECHTEL HAD PLEDGED TO HELP RAISE FUNDING IN </p><p>THE AMOUNT OF 250 MILLION USD FOR A PORTION OF THE PROJECT. </p><p>THE GOC HAD ALREADY ASSUMED SIGNIFICANT COST OVERRUNS FOR THE </p><p>PROJECT.  HE LATER WENT ON TO EXPLAIN HOW HE HAD TURNED DOWN </p><p>FINANCING FROM THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT, WHICH WANTED TO </p><p>INVEST IN CROATIA.  A NEGATIVE DECISION ON THE OPIC GUARANTEE </p><p>WOULD NOT GO OVER WELL WITH THE GOC AND COULD BE A "PUBLIC </p><p>DISASTER" FOR THE U.S. IF SUCH A DECISION WERE TO REACH THE </p><p>CROATIAN PRESS.  THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE FOR THE GOC ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE, PARTICULARLY SINCE ELECTIONS ARE A FEW MONTHS AWAY. </p><p>CACIC SAID HE WOULD TRY TO WORK WITH OTHER KEY MINISTRIES IN </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROBLEMS ARISE.  (COMMENT:  WE DO NOT </p><p>SHARE CACIC\'S VIEW.  WHILE THE GOC MAY BE UPSET IF IT HAS TO </p><p>SETTLE FOR MORE EXPENSIVE FINANCING, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT </p><p>ANY CRITICISM OF A POSSIBLE NEGATIVE DECISION ON AN OPIC </p><p>GUARANTEE WOULD GAIN MUCH TRACTION IN THE PRESS.  END COMMENT. </p><p>) </p><p>FRANK </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
