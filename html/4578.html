END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>PRIORITY ON PAPER </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.

IN PRINCIPLE, ACCORDING TO THE </p><p>ETHNIC MINORITIES COMMISSION, EDUCATION AT THE ELEMENTARY- </p><p>LEVEL SHOULD BE BOTH IN THE LOCAL LANGUAGE AND VIETNAMESE, </p><p>WHILE SWITCHING EXCLUSIVELY TO VIETNAMESE AT THE JUNIOR HIGH </p><p>SCHOOL-LEVEL AND ABOVE. </p><p> </p><p>4.

THERE ARE ALSO "SPECIAL COURSES" TO </p><p>HELP THEM PREPARE BOTH FOR THE EXAMINATIONS AND FOR </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02885  02 OF 04  030745Z </p><p>UNIVERSITY CURRICULUM, ACCORDING TO MOET.  MOET\'S HOPE, </p><p>ACCORDING TO ITS STUDENT AFFAIRS OFFICIALS, IS THAT ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY STUDENTS WILL RETURN TO THEIR HOME AREAS ONCE THEY </p><p>HAVE GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL OR UNIVERSITY, IN MOST CASES </p><p>TO BECOME LOCAL CADRES. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U)  OFFICIALS AT THE ETHNIC MINORITIES COMMISSION NOTED </p><p>THAT CAO BANG PROVINCE HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY RESIDENTS -- 96.07 PCT OF THE POPULATION -- WHILE </p><p>ANOTHER EIGHT PROVINCES HAD MORE THAN 50 PCT ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>POPULATIONS.  (ALL ARE IN THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST HIGHLANDS, </p><p>EXCEPT KON TUM IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, WHERE THE </p><p>POPULATION IS 53.02 PCT ETHNIC MINORITIES). THEY CONFIRMED </p><p>THAT ONLY ABOUT 80 PCT OF ELEMENTARY-AGE STUDENTS IN THESE </p><p>TWO PROVINCES ATTEND SCHOOL SO FAR, WHILE CLAIMING THAT ALL </p><p>VILLAGES IN CAO BANG AND BAC KAN NOW HAVE ELECTRICITY AND </p><p>HEALTH CENTERS (AS IMPROBABLE AS THIS SOUNDS), WITH ABOUT 90 </p><p>PCT OF VILLAGES REACHABLE BY ROAD AND HAVING POST OFFICES. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>ON THE GROUND REALITIES:  CAO BANG </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  ACCORDING TO CAO BANG PROVINCIAL VICE CHAIRMAN </p><p>HOANG VAN KHOI, THE PROVINCE WAS "VERY CONCERNED" WITH </p><p>EDUCATION, AND HAD REACHED UNIVERSAL ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN </p><p>1979 (CONTRARY TO ASSERTIONS IN HANOI -- SEE ABOVE).  HE </p><p>ADMITTED THAT ONLY ABOUT 37 PCT OF JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AGE </p><p>RESIDENTS WERE IN SCHOOL AS OF 2002, HOWEVER.  HE DESCRIBED </p><p>THE SYSTEM OF SIX BOARDING SCHOOLS -- FIVE AT THE JUNIOR </p><p>HIGH SCHOOL-LEVEL AND ONE AT THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL-LEVEL  - </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02885  02 OF 04  030745Z </p><p>- THAT PROVIDE FREE EDUCATION, ROOM, BOARD, BOOKS, </p><p>NOTEBOOKS, AND OTHER SUPPLIES TO THEIR STUDENTS.

(U)  DESPITE CONSTITUTIONAL AND OTHER ADMONITIONS TO </p><p>EMPLOY LOCAL LANGUAGES WHEN POSSIBLE, CAO BANG ONLY HAS </p><p>"SOME" ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THAT OFFER THE DUAL LANGUAGE </p><p>TRACK, KHOI (HIMSELF AN ETHNIC TAY) ADMITTED.  HE CLAIMED </p><p>THAT CHILDREN COULD "LEARN THEIR LOCAL LANGUAGE AT HOME." </p><p>TEACHERS WHO DO NOT COME FROM THE SAME LOCAL ETHNIC MINORITY </p><p>ARE NOT GIVEN LANGUAGE TRAINING, BUT "PICK UP THE LOCAL </p><p>LANGUAGE ON THEIR OWN," HE ADDED.  HE NOTED THAT MALE/FEMALE </p><p>STUDENT RATIOS WERE ABOUT EVEN, AND CLAIMED THAT ATTITUDES </p><p>TOWARD THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION DEPENDED LESS ON ETHNIC </p><p>MINORITY THAN ON ECONOMIC/EDUCATIONAL STATUS: BETTER OFF, </p><p>BETTER EDUCATED RESIDENTS OF ALL ETHNIC GROUPS TENDED BETTER </p><p>TO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U)  AS ELSEWHERE IN VIETNAM, VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IS </p><p>BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT IN CAO BANG.  VICE CHAIRMAN KHOI </p><p>SAID THAT THE PROVINCE NOW HAS THREE VOCATIONAL TRAINING </p><p>CENTERS -- TWO AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL, AND ONE IN THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL CAPITAL -- BUT ADDED THAT REGULAR SCHOOLS </p><p>INCREASINGLY ALSO OFFERED CRAFT TRAINING SUCH AS CARPENTRY, </p><p>SEWING, ELECTRICITY, ETC. </p><p> </p><p>11.

TEACHERS ARE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE, </p><p>HOWEVER.  ABOUT 30 PCT GO ON TO STUDY AT THE UNIVERSITY </p><p>LEVEL, WITH ABOUT 5-7 PCT AT ONE OF THE THREE CENTRAL-LEVEL </p><p>UNIVERSITIES.  "ALMOST ALL" STUDENTS EVENTUALLY RETURN TO </p><p>THEIR HOME AREAS, HE CLAIMED, ALTHOUGH MANY MIGHT RATHER </p><p>STAY IN THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL OR ANOTHER LARGER CITY BUT </p><p>CANNOT FIND EMPLOYMENT. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (U)  THE CAO BANG SCHOOL BEGAN TEACHING ENGLISH IN </p><p>1997, BUT STILL DOES NOT OFFER ANY COMPUTER TRAINING; THE </p><p>ONLY COMPUTER IS IN THE MAIN SCHOOL OFFICE, THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>ADMITTED.
