<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000464 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/ARP, NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, EAID, ECON, IZ, JO, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  (C) JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR PROVIDES </p><p>          READOUT ON ABDULLAH\'S VISIT; DUBAI </p><p>          INVESTORS\' CONFERENCE A BUST </p><p> </p><p>REF:  Dubai 381 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) SUMMARY: Jordanian Ambassador to the UAE, </p><p>Turki Khreisheh provided the Ambassador a brief </p><p>readout on King Abdullah\'s January 20-22 visit to </p><p>the UAE.  Khreisheh noted that for the first time, </p><p>Abdullah -- accompanied only by intel chief Saad </p><p>Kheir -- met privately with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince </p><p>and Zayid successor Shaykh Khalifa.  The primary </p><p>topic of this meeting was Jordan\'s difficult </p><p>internal situation and steps the UAE could possibly </p><p>take to alleviate Jordan\'s economic woes. </p><p>Khreisheh also briefed that the Jordan investment </p><p>conference held in Dubai was not a success (see </p><p>reftel), in part due to disconnects on the Jordanian </p><p>side as well as the fact that a looming military </p><p>conflict with Iraq made for a poor investment </p><p>climate in Jordan.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p>GETTING TO KNOW YOU:  ABDULLAH AND KHALIFA MEET PRIVATELY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to Jordan\'s ambassador to the UAE, Turki </p><p>Khreisheh, King Abdullah\'s recent visit here was "very good" </p><p>because he finally had a long, private session with Abu </p><p>Dhabi Crown Prince Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayid Al-Nahyan, de </p><p>facto ruler of Abu Dhabi and Zayid\'s likely successor as UAE </p><p>President.  Khreisheh commented that Abdullah managed to </p><p>conduct the entire meeting -- which went for an hour and a </p><p>half -- in Arabic.  (Note:  Khalifa speaks almost no </p><p>English.  End Note.)   Khreisheh said he personally did not </p><p>mind not being in attendance at the meeting as it is </p><p>essential to have the King and the Crown Prince build a </p><p>personal relationship, particularly in light of the fact </p><p>that Khalifa calls the shots on the Abu Dhabi (and hence </p><p>UAE) budget and, by extension, the UAE\'s foreign assistance </p><p>programs.   While the King enjoys excellent relations with </p><p>UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Shaykh Muhammad Bin Zayid </p><p>Al-Nahyan, who is a great supporter of Jordan (the two, </p><p>having attended Sandhurst together, have been close personal </p><p>friends for a number of years), making the Khalifa </p><p>connection is critical at this particular juncture, </p><p>Khreisheh commented, given Jordan\'s dire economic situation. </p><p>Attending Abdullah at the meeting was Jordan\'s intelligence </p><p>chief, Saad Kheir, who according to Khreisheh provided the </p><p>briefing on the internal situation in Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>Dubai Investment Conference Yields Disappointing Results </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The much ballyhooed January 20 Jordan Investment </p><p>Conference in Dubai, attended by King Abdullah, was not a </p><p>success, Khreisheh briefed, at least in part because of poor </p><p>coordination among the Jordanian organizers.  In Khreisheh\'s </p><p>view, there are too many "economic" departments within the </p><p>Jordanian government -- in addition to those directly </p><p>connected to the court.  These various bodies were not in </p><p>full coordination with the economic advisor to the court, </p><p>who had overall responsibility for the conference.  At any </p><p>rate, Khreisheh questioned the timing of the conference, </p><p>noting that most investors will wait until "after Iraq" to </p><p>decide on whether and where to put their money.  The </p><p>Jordanian envoy noted that most of the big private sector </p><p>investors invited to the Dubai affair had initially </p><p>regretted and then half-heartedly attended only after the </p><p>Jordanian organizer enlisted the personal support of Dubai </p><p>Crown Prince Shaykh Muhammad Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum (MBR). </p><p>According to this version, those who showed up from the </p><p>Dubai business elite only did so because it was a command </p><p>performance.  As Khreisheh put it to the Ambassador, "you </p><p>cannot force investors to put their money down on the eve of </p><p>a war." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
