USAID STAFF FROM THE U.S. MISSION IN ROME AND </p><p>FOOD FOR PEACE/WASHINGTON TRAVELED TO GUINEA, SIERRA </p><p>LEONE, AND LIBERIA JANUARY 27 THROUGH FEBRUARY 7 TO </p><p>REVIEW THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION FOR REFUGEES, </p><p>INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS), AND RESIDENTS </p><p>OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY INFLUXES OF </p><p>EITHER GROUP.  THIS REPORT FOCUSES ON LIBERIA SOLELY. </p><p>SIERRA LEONE AND GUINEA ARE REPORTED IN SEPTELS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  FOR THE LAST YEAR IN LIBERIA, PEOPLE FROM THE </p><p>NORTHERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE SUFFERED </p><p>DISPLACEMENT FROM THEIR HOMES.  IN THE LAST MONTH, </p><p>THE PACE OF DISPLACEMENTS HAS INTENSIFIED, WITH SOME </p><p>PEOPLE NOW BEING DISPLACED FOR THE FOURTH TIME.  IT </p><p>IS UNCLEAR WHICH ORGANIZATIONS OR GROUPS ARE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR CAUSING THE DISPLACEMENT.  THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY IS ENCOUNTERING OBSTACLES IN </p><p>TRYING TO ACCESS SOME OF THE DISPLACED AND TO PROVIDE </p><p>ASSISTANCE. A UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE/HUMANITARIAN </p><p>COORDINATOR IS </p><p>DESPERATELY NEEDED IN LIBERIA TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF </p><p>THE IDPS, AND WFP NEEDS TO EXPEDITE THE PLACEMENT OF </p><p>ITS COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVE.  THE U.N. FOOD AND </p><p>AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION (FAO) MUST CONTINUE TO PUSH </p><p>THE LOCAL AND NATIONAL AUTHORITIES TO PROVIDE PARCELS </p><p>OF LAND TO THE IDPS AND REFUGEES SO THEY CAN FARM. </p><p>THE U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS </p><p>ARE GOING WELL, BUT NEED TO INCORPORATE MORE WOMEN </p><p>INTO THE WORK. NO POST-DISTRIBUTION FOOD MONITORING </p><p>HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN THE REFUGEE CAMPS SINCE </p><p>DECEMBER 2000 AND WAS NEVER BEGUN IN THE IDP CAMPS. </p><p>THIS TASK NEEDS TO BE REINSTATED.  CONTINGENCY </p><p>PLANNING MEASURES HAVE JUST BEGUN.  NGOS AND U.N. </p><p>AGENCIES HAVE LITTLE SUPPORT FROM THE DONOR COMMUNITY </p><p>AND MORALE IS LOW.  THE FOOD PIPELINE FOR LIBERIA IS </p><p>DUE TO BREAK IN JULY 2002.  NEW DONATIONS ARE </p><p>URGENTLY NEEDED.  SEE PARA 35 FOR RECOMMENDATIONS. </p><p>END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  JANUARY 27 THROUGH FEBRUARY 7, SENIOR EMERGENCY </p><p>COORDINATOR (SEC) IN THE U.S. MISSION/ROME REGINA </p><p>DAVIS AND DALE SKORIC, USAID/DCHA/FOOD FOR PEACE </p><p>OFFICER (FFPO), TRAVELED TO LIBERIA, GUINEA, AND </p><p>SIERRA LEONE TO REVIEW THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION </p><p>FOR REFUGEES, INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS), </p><p>AND RESIDENTS WHOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY </p><p>INFLUXES OF EITHER GROUP.  WFP\'S DEPUTY FOR THE WEST </p><p>AFRICA REGION, ARNOLD VERCKEN, ACCOMPANIED THE USAID </p><p>TEAM TO ALL THREE COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN LIBERIA JANUARY 31 THROUGH FEBRUARY 2, THE </p><p>TEAM MET WITH WFP/LIBERIA, FAO, THE U.N. HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR), THE U.N. SECURITY </p><p>OFFICER, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS), GOL </p><p>OFFICIALS, AND VISITED IDP CAMPS IN BONG COUNTY AND </p><p>KLAY JUNCTION, AS WELL AS THE SINJE REFUGEE CAMPS, </p><p>LOCATED VERY CLOSE TO PUJEHUN DISTRICT OF SIERRA </p><p>LEONE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  INTERNAL DISPLACEMENTS BEGAN IN LIBERIA ONE YEAR </p><p>AGO IN FEBRUARY, WHEN TOWNS IN UPPER LOFA COUNTY WERE </p><p>THE TARGETS OF SPORADIC FIGHTING AND CROSS-BORDER </p><p>INSURGENCY FROM GUINEA AND SIERRA LEONE.  THE </p><p>IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ATTACKS WAS </p><p>UNCLEAR.  THE IDPS FLED EAST AND SOUTH AND SETTLED IN </p><p>BONG COUNTY IN MAY, IN ONE OF FOUR CAMPS:  CARI I AND </p><p>II, TV TOWER, AND BELEFANAI.  CURRENTLY, THESE ARE </p><p>THE ONLY IDP CAMPS RECOGNIZED BY THE GOL.  LAST </p><p>SUMMER ADDITIONAL OUTBREAKS OF VIOLENCE OCCURRED IN </p><p>GBARPOLU COUNTY (FORMERLY KNOWN AS LOWER LOFA COUNTY) </p><p>AND AGAIN IN LOFA COUNTY.  NEW IDPS GROUPED AT </p><p>JENEMENA AND BOPOLU.  THOSE CAMPS SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>EMPTIED LAST FALL WITH THEIR INHABITANTS FLEEING </p><p>FURTHER SOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ON SATURDAY NIGHT, JANUARY 26, CAMP POPULATIONS </p><p>IN SAW MILL, LOCATED IN WESTERN LIBERIA, ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY THE TOWNSPEOPLE OF TUBMANBERG (ALSO KNOWN AS BOMI </p><p>HILLS) FLED TOWARDS KLAY JUNCTION.  BECAUSE THE </p><p>MOVEMENT OCCURRED DURING THE NIGHT AND WAS EXTREMELY </p><p>RUSHED, MANY ARRIVED WITH VERY LITTLE.  THE EXACT </p><p>IMPETUS FOR FLIGHT IS AGAIN UNCLEAR OTHER THAN THE </p><p>STATED SOUND OF GUNFIRE.  THE TEAM VISITED KLAY </p><p>JUNCTION ON FEBRUARY 2 AND TALKED WITH IDPS, WHERE </p><p>ABOUT 9,000 HAD GATHERED.  FIVE DAYS LATER, ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 7, KLAY JUNCTION WAS ATTACKED, FORCING THE </p><p>RECENT ARRIVALS TO TAKE FLIGHT ONCE AGAIN--THE FOURTH </p><p>TIME FOR SOME.  MOST FLED TOWARDS MONROVIA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>SITES OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.  AT LEAST 28,500 IDPS ACCOMMODATED IN THE FOUR </p><p>CAMPS IN BONG COUNTY (SEE PARA 5 ABOVE) RECEIVE </p><p>MONTHLY FOOD ASSISTANCE FROM WFP.  THE OPERATION HAS </p><p>BEEN ONGOING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, AND THUS FAR, HAS </p><p>BEEN RUNNING QUITE SMOOTHLY.  DURING THE TEAM\'S </p><p>VISIT, THERE WERE REPORTS OF AN ADDITIONAL 5,291 IDPS </p><p>THAT HAD ACCUMULATED NEAR THE TOWN OF GBONOTA, WEST </p><p>OF BELAFANAI.  THERE WERE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF </p><p>OTHER SMALL GROUPINGS OF IDPS IN OTHER VILLAGES CLOSE </p><p>TO GBONOTA, AND IT WAS THOUGHT THERE WERE ADDITIONAL </p><p>IDPS NORTH OF THE LARGE GROUP MOVING SOUTH.  THE NGOS </p><p>AND U.N. AGENCIES WERE BEING DENIED ACCESS TO THESE </p><p>NEW POPULATIONS; THE IDP FIGURE CAME FROM A CONCERNED </p><p>CITIZEN WHO HAD DECIDED TO REGISTER THEM.  THERE WERE </p><p>ALSO REPORTS THAT GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAVE BEEN </p><p>PREVENTING IDPS FROM CONGREGATING IN OR TRAVELLING IN </p><p>LARGE NUMBERS.  IN THE PREVIOUS THREE WEEKS, CARI I </p><p>AND II HAD ABSORBED MORE THAN 1,000 IDPS.  ACTION </p><p>CONTRE LA FAIM (ACF) AND MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES </p><p>(MSF) ARE WORKING IN THE TWO CAMPS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ADDITIONAL GROUPINGS OF IDPS LOCATED AT KLAY </p><p>JUNCTION, SINJE REFUGEE CAMP, AND IN HAINDII AS OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 2 WERE ESTIMATED TO TOTAL 14,300.  GIVEN </p><p>RECENT ATTACKS, IT IS BELIEVED THIS NUMBER HAS RISEN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  IT IS UNKNOWN WHERE THE GOVERNMENT\'S LIBERIA </p><p>REFUGEE, REPATRIATION AND RESETTLEMENT COMMISSION </p><p>(LRRRC) WILL RESETTLE THE NEWLY DISPLACED RECENTLY </p><p>PASSING THROUGH KLAY JUNCTION AND POINTS ONWARDS. </p><p>THERE IS DISCUSSION OF PUTTING THEM INTO AN OLD CAMP </p><p>IN A SUBURB OF MONROVIA KNOWN AS PERRY TOWN.  IDPS IN </p><p>HAINDII AND GBONOTA (LOCATED IN BONG COUNTY) MAY BE </p><p>ACCOMMODATED IN THE CURRENT FOUR IDP CAMPS IN THE </p><p>BONG AREA, OR IN AN ALTERNATIVE SITE THAT </p><p>ACCOMMODATED REFUGEES DURING THE EARLY 1990S, NEAR </p><p>THE TOWN OF TOTATA.  THE LATTER IS NOT PREFERRED BY </p><p>WFP OR OTHER NGOS DUE TO ITS DISTANCE FROM THE </p><p>CURRENT LOGISTICS SET-UP IN THE BONG AREA AND POOR </p><p>ROAD ACCESS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON THE IDPS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE GOL MINISTER OF PLAN TOLD THE USAID TEAM </p><p>THAT THE IDPS IN BONG COUNTY HAD ACCESS TO LAND FOR </p><p>PLANTING.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE TEAM ARRIVED IN THE BONG </p><p>CAMPS, THE AMOUNT OF LAND AVAILABLE TO THE IDPS </p><p>SEEMED TO BE QUITE SMALL.  CARI I AND II CAMPS ARE </p><p>LOCATED AT THE SITE OF THE ONCE-FUNCTIONING </p><p>AGRICULTURAL STATION AND THE IDPS ARE FARMING SOME </p><p>BITS OF LAND HERE AND THERE INSIDE THE CAMP.  THE </p><p>LRRRC HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH THE LAND </p><p>OWNERS TO PROVIDE PARCELS OF LAND TO THE IDPS FOR </p><p>FARMING, BUT ITS EFFORTS HAVE YIELDED LITTLE PROGRESS </p><p>THUS FAR. </p><p> </p><p>11.  WFP SHOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH FAO TO FOLLOW UP ON </p><p>THE ACCESSIBILITY OF FARMLAND TO IDPS IN BONG COUNTY. </p><p>IF IT IS FOUND THAT LAND HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED TO THE </p><p>IDPS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES, WHICH THE USAID TEAM </p><p>STRONGLY SUSPECTS, FAO SHOULD LOBBY STRONGLY WITH THE </p><p>LOCAL AND NATIONAL AUTHORITIES TO ATTAIN THE </p><p>NECESSARY LAND.  DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDERWAY; IT IS JUST </p><p>NOT CLEAR HOW SOLID THE COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN.  AS </p><p>THE PLANTING SEASON FOR THE MAIN RICE CROP BEGINS IN </p><p>MAY, THE NEED TO SOLIDIFY COMMITMENTS IS CRITICAL. </p><p>THE TEAM MADE THIS POINT WITH THE FAO REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>BEFORE ITS DEPARTURE.  FAO IS IN THE PROCESS OF </p><p>DEVELOPING AN EMERGENCY PROJECT TO PROVIDE SEED RICE, </p><p>ASSORTED VEGETABLE AND GROUNDNUTS SEED, AND CASSAVA </p><p>PLANTING MATERIALS TO IDP FAMILIES IN BONG COUNTY. </p><p> </p><p>12.  IN ADDITION, THE LOCAL POPULATION IN BONG IS </p><p>DEVELOPING HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE IDPS, AS IT WAS </p><p>REPORTED THAT LOCALS HAD RECENTLY TAKEN 50 MACHETES </p><p>FROM THE IDPS IN AN EFFORT TO STOP THE IDPS FROM </p><p>CUTTING DOWN TREES.  THE U.N. SECURITY OFFICER ALSO </p><p>TOLD THE TEAM THAT THE GOL SECURITY FORCES IN THE </p><p>AREA, OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIETIES, SEVERELY </p><p>RESTRICT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF THE IDPS OUTSIDE THE </p><p>CAMP, ESPECIALLY THE MEN.  IF A PERSON WANTS TO </p><p>TRAVEL FAR FROM THE CAMP, IT MUST BE DONE </p><p>CLANDESTINELY.  THE TEAM ALSO HEARD REPORTS OF IDPS </p><p>BEING BEATEN WHO WERE FOUND OUTSIDE THE CAMP.  IT </p><p>SHOULD BE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT TAYLOR\'S FARM IS IN </p><p>CLOSE PROXIMITY TO CARI AND TV TOWER CAMPS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  AS BONG AND LOFA COUNTIES ARE CONSIDERED THE </p><p>BREAD BASKETS FOR THE COUNTRY, THE UPROOTING OF THE </p><p>POPULATION IN THESE TWO COUNTIES WILL MOST LIKELY </p><p>HAVE LONG-TERM RAMIFICATIONS ON THE FOOD SECURITY OF </p><p>THE COUNTRY.  ALL EFFORTS NEED TO BE MADE TO DIMINISH </p><p>THE IMPACT TO ENSURE THE COUNTRY DOES NOT SLIP BACK </p><p>INTO FOOD AID DEPENDENCY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>LACK OF ACCESS TO NEW IDPS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  AS STATED IN PARA 7 ABOVE, THE GOL HAS BEEN </p><p>DENYING ACCESS TO NEWLY DISPLACED POPULATIONS, UNDER </p><p>THE RUBRIC OF SECURITY, SAYING THE GOL IS RETRIEVING </p><p>STOLEN ASSETS OR THE AREA IS TOO INSECURE TO ALLOW </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES ACCESS.  IN THE LAST FEW </p><p>MONTHS, THE GOL SECURITY FORCES ALSO REPORTEDLY </p><p>PREVENTED MOVEMENT OF IDPS FROM THE BOPOLU AND </p><p>GBARPOLU CAMPS TO AREAS FURTHER SOUTH.  THE IDPS </p><p>DESIRED TO RELOCATE BECAUSE OF RUMORS OF THE FRONT </p><p>LINES MOVING THEIR WAY.  THESE ACTIONS, OF COURSE, </p><p>VIOLATE THE TENETS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW. </p><p>THE NGOS AND U.N. AGENCIES ARE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED </p><p>BY THE GOL\'S POLICIES AND FEEL THEY ARE BEING </p><p>MANIPULATED.  THEY ARE CAUGHT IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN </p><p>THE GOL\'S HESITANCY/UNWILLINGNESS TO ESTABLISH CAMPS </p><p>AND THEIR DESIRE TO TRY TO ASSIST VULNERABLE </p><p>POPULATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>15.  COORDINATION MEETINGS CHAIRED BY THE LRRRC ARE </p><p>TAKING PLACE IN MONROVIA.  THE USAID TEAM MET WITH </p><p>ITS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SAMUEL BROWN, AND MET MANY </p><p>LRRRC STAFF WHILE MAKING CAMP VISITS.  ALTHOUGH LRRRC </p><p>STAFF SEEM TO BE MAKING AN HONEST EFFORT TO ASSIST </p><p>THE IDPS, THE TEAM WAS TROUBLED TO LEARN THAT THE </p><p>LRRRC FALLS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>JUSTICE (MOJ).  THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE SERVES AS THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT SECURITY COMMISSION THAT MAKES </p><p>THE DECISIONS REGARDING ACCESS.  THE TEAM FOUND THIS </p><p>TO BE A SERIOUS CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR THE PLIGHT </p><p>OF THE IDPS.  ANY DECISION RELATED TO HUMANITARIAN </p><p>ACCESS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE MOJ, WHILE AT THE SAME </p><p>TIME, THE LRRRC IS SUPPOSEDLY LOBBYING ITS BOSS FOR </p><p>ACCESS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CAMPS.  THUS FAR, THE </p><p>GOL HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO ESTABLISH IDP CAMPS NEAR </p><p>MONROVIA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS FOR THE IDPS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  WFP\'S IMPLEMENTING PARTNER IN BONG COUNTY FOR </p><p>THE DISTRIBUTIONS IS THE LIBERIAN NATIONAL RED CROSS </p><p>(LNRC).  THERAPEUTIC AND SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING IS </p><p>PROVIDED BY ACF, TARGETING APPROXIMATELY 450 </p><p>MALNOURISHED IDP CHILDREN.  WFP PROVIDES THE FOOD </p><p>COMMODITIES TO ACF.  WFP HAS DETERMINED THAT THE IDPS </p><p>IN BONG COUNTY HAVE SOME COPING MECHANISMS AND ARE </p><p>THEREFORE PROVIDED WITH A GENERAL MONTHLY RATION OF </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 1,800 KILOCALORIES (KC) PER DAY PER </p><p>BENEFICIARY, RATHER THAN THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD </p><p>OF 2,100 KC. </p><p> </p><p>17.  THE TEAM WAS RATHER SURPRISED TO FIND THAT </p><p>REGISTERED IDPS RECEIVE RATIONS USING THE CLUSTER </p><p>METHOD, WHEREBY A GROUP LEADER RECEIVES THE FOOD ON </p><p>BEHALF OF HIS/HER GROUP AND FOOD COMMODITIES ARE </p><p>DIVIDED AMONG THE GROUP.  A GROUP IS COMPOSED OF </p><p>SEVERAL FAMILIES, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 17 FAMILIES. </p><p>WFP HAD BEEN SCOOPING SEPARATELY TO FAMILIES, BUT IN </p><p>JANUARY DECIDED TO SWITCH TO THE CLUSTER METHOD. </p><p>(NOTE:  INTERESTINGLY, WFP/GUINEA HAS JUST MADE THE </p><p>OPPOSITE SWITCH BECAUSE OF THE FRAUD THAT HAD BEEN </p><p>TAKING PLACE USING THE CLUSTER METHOD IN THE REFUGEE </p><p>CAMPS IN GUINEA.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>18.  IN STABLE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS REASONABLE </p><p>SOCIAL COHESION, THE CLUSTER SYSTEM USUALLY WORKS </p><p>WELL AND CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE AND INEXPENSIVE. </p><p>HOWEVER, IT REQUIRES TRAINING AND SUPERVISION. </p><p>FOLLOWING A DISTRIBUTION ASSESSMENT BY THE SEC AND </p><p>FFPO IN BONG, THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE CASE. </p><p>WHILE NOT CHAOTIC, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER ACTUAL </p><p>DISTRIBUTIONS ARE MADE ACCORDING TO HOUSEHOLD SIZE OR </p><p>IF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING THEIR </p><p>ENTITLEMENTS. THE USAID TEAM RAISED ITS RESERVATIONS </p><p>ABOUT THIS SYSTEM WITH WFP, AND THE WFP ACTING </p><p>COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVE PROMISED TO REVIEW ITS </p><p>EFFECTIVENESS FOLLOWING THE MARCH DISTRIBUTION AND </p><p>REPORT TO THE TEAM. </p><p> </p><p>19.  FOR ACCOUNTABILITY PURPOSES, THE PRESENCE OF </p><p>MONITORS DURING DISTRIBUTION NEEDS TO BE AUGMENTED, </p><p>POST-DISTRIBUTION MONITORING NEEDS TO BE INITIATED, </p><p>AND REGULAR REPORTING NEEDS TO SYSTEMATIZED.  AT THE </p><p>SAME TIME, NEW BENEFICIARY CARDS, POSSIBLY LAMINATED, </p><p>NEED TO BE ISSUED AS THE CURRENT ONES ARE OLD AND ARE </p><p>DETERIORATING. </p><p> </p><p>20.  IT WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE TEAM THAT WOMEN WERE </p><p>NOT EQUALLY REPRESENTED AS GROUP LEADERS NOR AS HEADS </p><p>OF HOUSEHOLDS ON BENEFICIARY LISTS.  WFP NEEDS TO </p><p>ENSURE THAT GENDER CONSIDERATIONS FIGURE PROMINENTLY </p><p>IN ITS FOOD ASSISTANCE TO IDPS.  TO WFP\'S CREDIT, </p><p>THIS UNDER-REPRESENTATION WAS ALSO ABUNDANTLY CLEAR </p><p>TO WFP\'S WEST AFRICA REGIONAL DEPUTY, VERCKEN, WHO </p><p>POINTEDLY CLARIFIED WFP\'S GENDER POLICY TO THE </p><p>LIBERIA WFP TEAM.  WFP AND ITS IPS NEED TO </p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO ARE </p><p>SERVING AND ARE RECEIVING THE FOOD IN RECOGNITION OF </p><p>THEIR ROLE IN HOUSEHOLD FOOD MANAGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>21.  TO LOWER THE LIKELIHOOD THAT NEWLY DISPLACED </p><p>RESIDING OUTSIDE OF GOL-RECOGNIZED CAMPS WILL BE </p><p>ATTACKED, WFP HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTING WEEKLY FOOD </p><p>RATIONS TO NEW IDPS, WHEN POSSIBLE, UNTIL THEY CAN BE </p><p>RELOCATED TO MORE SECURE SITES.  ONCE THEY ARE </p><p>RELOCATED TO A SECURE SITE, FOOD RATIONS WILL BE </p><p>REGULARIZED AND PROVIDED MONTHLY BY WFP, AS THEY ARE </p><p>FOR IDPS LOCATED IN THE FOUR CAMPS IN BONG COUNTY. </p><p>REMOTE AREAS AND DIFFICULT CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE </p><p>THAT ASSISTANCE BE PROVIDED TO NEWLY DISPLACED BEFORE </p><p>DETAILED NEEDS ASSESSMENTS CAN BE COMPLETED, AS FOOD </p><p>WILL REMAIN A HIGH PRIORITY.  SUCH AN INITIAL </p><p>RESPONSE WOULD NOT OBVIATE THE NEED FOR SUCH AN </p><p>ASSESSMENT AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p></p><p>REFUGEE OPERATIONS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>22.  WFP CURRENTLY PROVIDES FOOD ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 38,000 SIERRA LEONEAN REFUGEES WHO ARE </p><p>ACCOMMODATED IN SIX CAMPS - SINJE 1 & 2 ALONG THE </p><p>SIERRA LEONE AND LIBERIA BORDER IN GRAND CAPE MOUNT </p><p>COUNTY AND FOUR CAMPS IN MONTSERRADO COUNTY NEAR </p><p>MONROVIA. </p><p> </p><p>23.  WFP, THROUGH THE LIBERIAN ISLAMIC UNION FOR </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (LIURD), PROVIDES A </p><p>RATION OF APPROXIMATELY 1,800 KC PER DAY PER REFUGEE. </p><p>DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE REFUGEES ARE ALSO USING THE </p><p>CLUSTER SYSTEM (SEE PARA 17 ABOVE).  THE DISTRIBUTION </p><p>SYSTEM WAS RECENTLY CHANGED FROM SCOOPING TO CLUSTERS </p><p>BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE BENEFICIARIES </p><p>THEMSELVES TO THE REFUGEES\' CENTRAL MANAGEMENT </p><p>COMMITTEE (CMC) COMPOSED OF REFUGEES. </p><p> </p><p>24.  BOTH WFP AND UNHCR SEEM COMFORTABLE WITH THE NEW </p><p>DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND THE USAID TEAM GOT A VERY </p><p>POSITIVE RESPONSE WHEN IT ASKED THE CMC IF THE </p><p>WEAKEST IN THE CAMP WERE RECEIVING THEIR RATIONS.  AT </p><p>THIS POINT HOWEVER, THERE IS NO WAY OF REALLY KNOWING </p><p>IF THE MOST VULNERABLE REFUGEES/HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVE </p><p>THEIR ENTITLEMENTS BECAUSE NO POST-DISTRIBUTION </p><p>MONITORING (PDM) HAS BEEN DONE SINCE DECEMBER 2000. </p><p>THIS POSES SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS TO THE USAID TEAM. </p><p>IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT PDM BE REINSTATED AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE, AND THAT INDEPENDENT MONITORING BY WFP AND </p><p>NGO PARTNERS DURING AND AFTER DISTRIBUTION BE </p><p>IMPROVED.  WHILE THE GLOBAL MEMORANDUM OF </p><p>UNDERSTANDING (MOU) BETWEEN WFP AND UNHCR DOES NOT </p><p>SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT A TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT IN THE </p><p>CHOICE OF IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS (IPS) FOR PDM IS </p><p>REQUIRED, THE TEAM RECOMMENDED THAT IN LINE WITH THE </p><p>SPIRIT OF THE MOU, A JOINT AGREEMENT SHOULD BE </p><p>REACHED SOON IN CHOOSING AN IP FOR PDM. </p><p> </p><p>25.  AS WITH THE IDP FOOD DISTRIBUTION, IT WAS </p><p>RECOGNIZED THAT WOMEN WERE NEITHER EQUALLY </p><p>REPRESENTED AS GROUP DISTRIBUTORS NOR AS HEADS OF </p><p>HOUSEHOLDS ON BENEFICIARY LISTS.  AGAIN, WFP AND </p><p>LIURD NEED TO ENSURE THAT GENDER CONSIDERATIONS </p><p>FIGURE PROMINENTLY IN ITS FOOD ASSISTANCE TO </p><p>REFUGEES. </p><p> </p><p>26.  AN EARLIER SURVEY BY UNHCR HAD SHOWN THAT UP TO </p><p>70% OF THE SINJE REFUGEE POPULATION MAY WISH TO </p><p>RETURN TO SIERRA LEONE.  WITH THE RECENT ATTACKS ON </p><p>KLAY JUNCTION, THE DESIRE TO REPATRIATE TO SIERRA </p><p>LEONE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER HAS INCREASED.  THOSE </p><p>PROVIDED WITH FOOD ASSISTANCE IN JANUARY IN SINJE I </p><p>AND II TOTALLED 16,280.  ON FEBRUARY 4, UNHCR STARTED </p><p>AN ACCELERATED REGISTRATION PROCESS FOR THOSE </p><p>REFUGEES WHO MAY WISH TO RETURN TO SIERRA LEONE. </p><p> </p><p>27.  FOR THOSE REFUGEES WHO CHOOSE TO REMAIN IN </p><p>LIBERIA, FAO AND WFP SHOULD JOINTLY UNDERTAKE AN </p><p>ASSESSMENT TO EXAMINE COPING MECHANISMS, ASSET LEVELS </p><p>AND FACTORS AFFECTING ACCESS TO FOOD AND LOCAL LAND </p><p>FOR THE RESIDUAL REFUGEE POPULATION.  THE RESULTS MAY </p><p>INFLUENCE THE LEVEL OR TYPE OF FOOD ASSISTANCE </p><p>REQUIRED FOR THIS CASELOAD. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>STAFFING </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>28.  ALTHOUGH THE WFP SENIOR PROGRAM OFFICER IS DOING </p><p>A FINE JOB AS THE ACTING WFP COUNTRY DIRECTOR IN </p><p>LIBERIA, WFP NEEDS TO PLACE A MORE SENIOR </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN THE COUNTRY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>MORALE OF THE HUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>29.  THE USAID TEAM WAS QUITE TAKEN WITH THE LOW </p><p>MORALE OF THE HUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY.  THE U.N. </p><p>COUNTRY TEAM AND THE NGOS SEEM TO BE COMPLETELY </p><p>DEMORALIZED FROM LACK OF FUNDING, LACK OF DONOR </p><p>INTEREST, LACK OF ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS, AND </p><p>NOW BY THE DETERIORATING SECURITY SITUATION COUPLED </p><p>WITH THE ONGOING DIFFICULTY OF WORKING WITH THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT.  WITH THAT SAID, HOWEVER, THE LEVEL OF </p><p>COMPETENCE AMONG THE WFP, FAO, AND UNHCR IS QUITE </p><p>ACCEPTABLE, AND THE USAID TEAM ENCOURAGED THEM TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO PUSH THE GOVERNMENT ON HUMANITARIAN </p><p>PRINCIPLES.  LACK OF VISITORS AND DONOR SUPPORT DO </p><p>HAVE THEIR EFFECT, HOWEVER, IN HOW ENTHUSIASTICALLY </p><p>AND AGGRESSIVELY THEY APPROACH THEIR WORK. </p><p> </p><p>30.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THERE IS NO/NO UNDP RESIDENT </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE/HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR IN LIBERIA TO </p><p>WORK WITH THE GOL IN ADDRESSING THE HUMANITARIAN </p><p>NEEDS OF THE IDPS.  THE U.N. PROPOSED TWO CANDIDATES </p><p>WHO WERE BOTH REJECTED BY THE GOL.  A THIRD HAS NOW </p><p>BEEN APPROVED.  THE NEED FOR THE SWIFT ARRIVAL OF THE </p><p>NEW RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE AT THIS PERILOUS MOMENT </p><p>CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANNING </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>31.  DURING THE SEC\'S AND FFPO\'S VISIT, IT WAS </p><p>RECOGNIZED THAT THERE IS A TREMENDOUS NEED FOR </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND PREPAREDNESS AS THE CURRENT </p><p>CRISIS DEEPENS AND POPULATION DISPLACEMENT INCREASES. </p><p>IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO THE UN COUNTRY TEAM THAT </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANNING MEASURES BE UNDERTAKEN </p><p>IMMEDIATELY TO ENSURE READINESS FOR POTENTIAL </p><p>EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AND AN ABILITY TO COPE WITH A </p><p>VARIETY OF SCENARIOS. AN ANALYSIS OF THE REGIONAL </p><p>DYNAMICS AND AN EXAMINATION OF RESOURCE IMPLICATIONS </p><p>SHOULD BE INCLUDED.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE TEAM\'S VISIT, </p><p>THE U.N. OFFICE FOR THE COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN </p><p>AFFAIRS (OCHA) DEPLOYED AN OFFICER TO LIBERIA TO </p><p>BEGIN THE CONTINGENCY PLANNING PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>FOOD SECURITY FORUM </p><p></p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>32.  AN INTER-AGENCY FOOD SECURITY FORUM (FSF) HAS </p><p>BEEN ACTIVE IN MONROVIA WITH THE AIM TO DEVELOP </p><p>COMMON APPROACHES TO FOOD INTERVENTIONS, FOOD </p><p>SECURITY ASSESSMENTS AND MONITORING.  THE FSF MEETS </p><p>ON A MONTHLY BASIS WITH A ROTATING CHAIR OF </p><p>PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS.  GIVEN THE CURRENT IN- </p><p>COUNTRY SITUATION, THE FSF WILL PROVIDE A GOOD VENUE </p><p>IN WHICH TO PLAN, TARGET, AND EVALUATE EMERGENCY FOOD </p><p>INTERVENTIONS AND SHOULD BE SUPPORTED AS SUCH. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>PIPELINE </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>33.  UNDER ITS CURRENT PRRO, WFP/LIBERIA REQUIRES </p><p>25,637 METRIC TONS (MT) FOOD AID TO PROVIDE TARGETED </p><p>FOOD ASSISTANCE TO A MONTHLY AVERAGE OF 108,550 </p><p>BENEFICIARIES (JANUARY - DECEMBER 2002).  FY 2002 </p><p>USAID/DCHA/FFP TITLE II EMERGENCY CONTRIBUTIONS TO </p><p>LIBERIA CURRENTLY AMOUNT TO 2,650 MT FOOD COMMODITIES </p><p>OR 1.4 MILLION USD, REPRESENTING ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF </p><p>THE TOTAL PRRO FOOD REQUIREMENTS.  WFP/LIBERIA FACES </p><p>AN 83 PERCENT SHORTFALL OF ITS TOTAL FOOD PROGRAM </p><p>REQUIREMENTS FOR 2002.  AS IS, THE WFP/LIBERIA </p><p>PIPELINE WILL START TO RUN DRY AS OF JULY 2002. </p><p>ADDITIONAL DONATIONS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>LOGISTICS </p><p></p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>34.  SINCE 2001 WFP HAS REDUCED ITS TRANSPORT, </p><p>STORAGE AND HANDLING (ITSH) RATE FOR LIBERIA BY USD 7 </p><p>PER MT.  IT IS HOPED THAT GIVEN THE WFP REGIONAL </p><p>LOGISTICS EXERCISE TO BE CONDUCTED IN MARCH 2002 THAT </p><p>THE ITSH RATE COULD BE REDUCED FURTHER. THIS TAKES </p><p>INTO CONSIDERATION THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF </p><p>NATIONAL LOGISTICS STAFF, THE POSSIBLE CLOSURE OF THE </p><p>EDP LOCATED IN HARPER, AND THE PARTIAL RELEASE OF THE </p><p>WFP DEDICATED FLEET NOW OPERATIONAL OUT OF THE PORT </p><p>OF MONROVIA. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>35.  RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-  THE U.N. NEEDS TO SPEED THE DEPLOYMENT OF A STRONG </p><p>UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE/HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR </p><p>WHO CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE IDPS WITH THE GOL.  A </p><p>WHOLE RANGE OF HUMANITARIAN ISSUES AND PRINCIPLES </p><p>REGARDING THE IDPS ARE IN QUESTION. </p><p> </p><p>-  WFP SHOULD DO ALL IT CAN TO SEE THAT THE PROPOSED </p><p>COUNTRY DIRECTOR BE APPROVED POST-HASTE BY THE GOL SO </p><p>HE CAN BE DEPLOYED SOONEST. </p><p> </p><p>-  WFP NEEDS TO DEVELOP A CLEAR POLICY ABOUT WHEN AND </p><p>HOW IT PROVIDES FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS TO NEWLY-DISPLACED </p><p>POPULATIONS.  THIS POLICY SHOULD BE SHARED WITH ALL </p><p>RELEVANT PARTIES. </p><p> </p><p>-  GIVEN CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS, WFP SHOULD CONTINUE TO </p><p>IMPROVE ITS STRATEGIES AS THE LEAD AGENCY FOR FOOD </p><p>COORDINATION REGARDING THE EMERGENCY SITUATION AND </p><p>CONTINUE TO BASE ITS INTERVENTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL </p><p>FOOD AND NUTRITION ASSESSMENTS INVOLVING OTHER </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS.  IN THIS REGARD, THE FOLLOWING NEEDS </p><p>TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS: </p><p> </p><p>A.   POST-DISTRIBUTION MONITORING NEEDS TO BE </p><p>REINSTATED IMMEDIATELY IN THE REFUGEE CAMPS, GUIDED </p><p>BY A TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT AMONG WFP, UNHCR, AND THE </p><p>IP.  WFP SHOULD BEGIN PDM IN THE IDP CAMPS, AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>B.   WOMEN NEED TO BECOME A MORE INTEGRAL PART OF THE </p><p>DISTRIBUTION PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>C.   USE OF MONITORS DURING THE DISTRIBUTION NEEDS TO </p><p>BE INCREASED. </p><p> </p><p>D.   THE CLUSTER METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION NEEDS TO BE </p><p>ANALYZED AFTER THREE TO FOUR MONTHS OF USE IN THE IDP </p><p>AND REFUGEE CAMPS TO ENSURE THAT THE WEAKEST AND MOST </p><p>VULNERABLE ARE RECEIVING THE INTENDED RATION. </p><p> </p><p>E.   WFP NEEDS TO CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT TO EXAMINE </p><p>COPING MECHANISMS, ASSET LEVELS, AND FACTORS </p><p>AFFECTING ACCESS TO FOOD AND LOCAL LAND FOR THE IDPS </p><p>IN BONG COUNTY AND FOR THE REFUGEES.  APPROPRIATE </p><p>ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RATION LEVEL SHOULD THEN BE </p><p>IMPLEMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>-  FAO SHOULD LOBBY STRONGLY WITH THE LOCAL AND </p><p>NATIONAL AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE LAND FOR AGRICULTURE </p><p>PRODUCTION FOR THE IDPS IN BONG COUNTY AND REMAINING </p><p>REFUGEES IN SINJE IS PROVIDED.  AS THE PLANTING </p><p>SEASON FOR THE MAIN RICE CROP BEGINS IN MAY, MOVING </p><p>SWIFTLY WITH SOLID AGREEMENTS IS CRITICAL. </p><p> </p><p>-  A DEMARCHE TO KEY DONORS HIGHLIGHTING THE </p><p>DETERIORATING SITUATION IN LIBERIA MIGHT BE HELPFUL </p><p>IN FILLING THE ANTICIPATED PIPELINE BREAK IN JULY. </p><p> </p><p>36.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.  HEILEMAN </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
