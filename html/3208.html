<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001913 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/27/2005 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, KCRM, PINS, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN READOUT TO G-7 AMBASSADORS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1597 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS.  REASON 1.5(B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary: The GON feels Africa needs more carrots and </p><p>fewer sticks to advance development, NPC Commissioner Isaac </p><p>Aluko Olokun told G-7 Heads of Mission in late May.  He urged </p><p>greater understanding for Nigeria\'s institutional flaws and </p><p>argued that NePAD should be a process, not an institution. </p><p>He said African countries needed easier access to developed </p><p>country markets and brushed aside our point about slow GON </p><p>progress toward fulfilling AGO textile requirements, saying </p><p>the West had "given" Nigeria democracy and would have to live </p><p>with the results.  The GON clearly feels that we should not </p><p>press it (or Africa as a whole) for immediate concrete steps. </p><p> Instead, the GON wants a dialogue in which the G-8 countries </p><p>offer both incentives and a sympathetic ear.  Transmission of </p><p>this message was inadvertently delayed.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Ambassador Isaac Aluko-Olukun 24 May briefed G-7 </p><p>Heads of Mission or charges (Russia not present) on the </p><p>Maputo NePAD/G-8 discussions.  He was unhappy with G-8 </p><p>resistance to discussion of middle income country debt </p><p>relief, the big issue for President Obasanjo.  He stressed </p><p>that NePAD (New Partnership for African Development) should </p><p>be a process, not an institution.  The issue of "NePAD </p><p>compliance" made many Africans uncomfortable; they felt </p><p>Baroness Amos\'s push for dealings only with those countries </p><p>that are "compliant" was out of place.  President Obasanjo </p><p>believed that Africa needed carrots, carrots, carrots, stick, </p><p>but the G-8 seemed to have sticks, sticks, sticks, carrot in </p><p>mind.  Africa also wanted more funds for infrastructure, </p><p>Aluko-Olukun said. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) British Acting High Commissioner Charles Bird bluntly </p><p>addressed the inadequacy of GON social spending (health and </p><p>education) and pushed pack hard against the NePAD desire for </p><p>"huge" infrastructure projects.  These had in the past </p><p>generated "huge corruption."  Aluko-Olukun responded in very </p><p>general terms ways and averred that the fight against </p><p>corruption was a priority for the Obasanjo administration. </p><p>He likened Nigeria to a loaded supertanker.  So many years of </p><p>military rule had jaded the body politic and diminished its </p><p>understanding of democratic mores.  The supertanker could not </p><p>change course nimbly.  The G-8 should observe and appreciate </p><p>the small signs of course adjustment, not expect new </p><p>directions immediately. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Changing the metaphor to foot travel, I commented </p><p>that the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single </p><p>step.  As diplomats and official visitors to Nigeria\'s </p><p>capital observed life, corruption (allocation of parkland to </p><p>officials and political figures) and waste (convoys of </p><p>14-plus vehicles ferrying governors around town) were daily </p><p>evident.  These were powerful, negative symbols.  Could </p><p>Aluko-Olukun offer one or two examples of what the GON was </p><p>doing to combat corruption and eliminate waste?  Aluko-Olukun </p><p>spoke eloquently but unspecifically about Obasanjo\'s strong </p><p>opposition to corruption.  When Aluko-Olukun wound down, Bird </p><p>repeated the earlier question.  The Nigerian official became </p><p>defensive, but he eventually cited the establishment of the </p><p>Independent Corrupt Practices Commission.  Huge gubernatorial </p><p>convoys were wasteful, he agreed, but they were a product of </p><p>gubernatorial vanity and excess.  The Federal Government </p><p>could not be held responsible.  There needed to be "fiscal </p><p>federalism" (compelling the states to generate more revenue </p><p>internally) in order to instill responsibility, Aluko-Olukun </p><p>concluded. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) COMMENT: The ICPC is underfunded, lacks prosecutorial </p><p>powers and depends (for now) on U.S.-funded training for its </p><p>staff.  In fact, the GON has taken a useful step to constrain </p><p>corruption, the establishment of a value-for-money audit of </p><p>major contracts called "due process."  Nevertheless, corrupt </p><p>allocation of land within Abuja is an expensive and glaringly </p><p>obvious symbol of the Obasanjo Administration\'s inability to </p><p>get at the root of corruption.  Aluko-Olukun briefly sought </p><p>to defend the practice, saying that Nigerian civil servants </p><p>lacked adequate pensions and needed some means to support </p><p>themselves in retirement.  He dropped that tack when body </p><p>language made it clear that the diplomats around him were not </p><p>sympathetic.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Aluko-Olukun said there would be a gathering on the </p><p>margins of the AFDB annual meeting in Addis Ababa to advance </p><p>discussion on both the political and economic peer review </p><p>mechanisms.  He did not suggest that final consensus would be </p><p>reached.  He complained that Libya\'s Qadhafi was inciting </p><p>other African Heads of State against Obasanjo\'s efforts to </p><p>introduce greater transparency by caviling that they were </p><p>stalking horses for neocolonialism.  Obasanjo needed strong </p><p>support, not questions and skepticism, in order to make the </p><p>peer review mechanism a reality. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Africa civil society groups were also bedeviling the </p><p>NePAD Heads of State, Aluko-Olukun continued.  They generally </p><p>opposed engagement with the G-8.  Most Heads of State had the </p><p>electoral mandates the NGOs lacked and were resolute about </p><p>pursuing engagement, however.  Bird encouraged continued </p><p>engagement with, and education of, the NGOs.  Aluko-Olukun </p><p>agreed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Aluko-Olukun raised market access issues, worrying </p><p>that increased U.S. farm subsidies could eventually reduce </p><p>markets for African goods.  I pointed out that Nigeria\'s </p><p>national legislature needed to make one minor change to a law </p><p>in order to take an important step toward AGOA eligibility. </p><p>Aluko-Olukun riposted that "you gave us democracy" and so had </p><p>to live with the results.  Another participant asked what the </p><p>GON was doing to educate legislators.  Aluko-Olukun replied </p><p>that efforts were in train but that few Nigerian legislators </p><p>were interested in NePAD.  South Africa was having a bit more </p><p>success because its parliamentarians understood the potential </p><p>of NePAD. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) COMMENT:  Many Nigerian Senators and House Members </p><p>pursue personal interests to the near-exclusion of concern </p><p>for the welfare of their fellow citizens -- a trait they </p><p>share with many officials of the Executive Branch.  As </p><p>Aluko-Olukun\'s brief foray into justifying nontransparent </p><p>land-allocation practices suggests, changing these attitudes </p><p>will indeed take time.  The GON apparently feels, probably </p><p>from its very top, that the G-8 countries should demand fewer </p><p>and less difficult concrete steps of struggling African </p><p>countries.  Instead, we are asked to lend a sympathetic </p><p>listening ear and to provide carrots (incentives) rather than </p><p>to wield sticks.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) NOTE:  This message was prepared on May 28, 2002. </p><p>Post regrets that an oversight inadvertently delayed its </p><p>transmission. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
