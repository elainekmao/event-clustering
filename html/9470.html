<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001823 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR DS/ICI/PII, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/IP/EUR, DS/ICI/CI, </p><p>DS/IP/FPO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ASEC, PTER, NL </p><p>SUBJECT:  SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY NEAR AM CON GEN AMSTERDAM ON </p><p>07/15/03 </p><p> </p><p>1.   (SBU) At approximately 1555 hrs on 07/15/2003 The Royal </p><p>Marechaussee (KMAR) Anti Terror Unit, deployed inside the </p><p>fence line at the consulate, noted a suspicious individual </p><p>on the Museumplein (public park area)just beyond the second </p><p>fence line who appeared to be paying particular attention to </p><p>their activity inside the grounds. The subject was carrying </p><p>what has been described as a "jerry can". The subject walked </p><p>around the immediate area and then approached the outer </p><p>fence line not far from the Amsterdam Police fixed post, set </p><p>down his container and walked away. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) The KMAR unsuccessfully attempted to notify the </p><p>Amsterdam Police Post outside. The Police have </p><p>responsibility for activity outside the fence line.  The </p><p>KMAR made radio contact with the adjoining Amsterdam Police </p><p>mobile unit but by the time response elements arrived the </p><p>subject had left the area and was not located. The </p><p>responding units found that the container bore the marking </p><p>sulfuric acid/battery acid.  The area surrounding the </p><p>container was roped off and the fire department responded </p><p>and declared the contents to be a 51% solution of battery </p><p>acid.  The fire department tested the solution, however, the </p><p>can was left for another city department to collect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.   (SBU) The subject is described as a white male, </p><p>probably Dutch, wearing a yellow tee shirt.  He was </p><p>variously described as middle aged or elderly.  No further </p><p>description. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) The police established a clear zone around the </p><p>jerry can but took no steps to clear the park or evacuate </p><p>the Consulate.  Since there was no apparent threat or </p><p>political motivation the authorities are not taking this as </p><p>a threat to the consulate or an attempt to injure any person </p><p>or property. </p><p> </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
