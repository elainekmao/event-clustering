This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for December 19, 2002.  Please note that Turkish </p><p>press reports often contain errors or </p><p>exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch </p><p>for the accuracy of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  TGS: NO WAR PREPARATIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST </p><p>(All papers)  Regarding the reports of deployment </p><p>of Turkish soldiers along the Iraqi border, the </p><p>Chief of General Staff denied having made </p><p>comprehensive build-up and taken extraordinary </p><p>measures, other than "routine preparations toward </p><p>possible developments in the region." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  CALL FOR ACTION AGAINST WAR </p><p>(Evrensel)  A group of intelligentsia and authors </p><p>who met for an activity organized by the </p><p>Diyarbakir chapter of Human Rights Association </p><p>(HRA) called on the public, mass organizations </p><p>and political parties to oppose the possible U.S. </p><p>attack on Iraq.  They pointed to "hard-to-repair </p><p>wounds" in case of such a war and underscored the </p><p>need to disrupt the war plans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  ADANA HRA:  U.S. CENTER OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS </p><p>(Evrensel)  In a (December 18) press conference, </p><p>Adana Human Rights Association (HRA) members </p><p>pointed to continued rights violations, saying </p><p>those who filled the earth with blood, tears, </p><p>fire and gunpowder are now warmongering.  They </p><p>described the U.S. as the center of human rights </p><p>violations, torture and dirty war methods.  Anti- </p><p>war slogans were shouted during the conference. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  KURDISH SONGS NOT SEPARATIST </p><p>(Radikal)  The trial of nine people, including </p><p>seven teachers, indicted for "assisting and </p><p>abetting the PKK" by forming a band and singing </p><p>"separatist" (Kurdish-language) songs at the </p><p>ordinary Congress of the Diyarbakir chapter of </p><p>the Teachers Union Egitim-Sen is scheduled to </p><p>continue on December 19.  The court reportedly </p><p>received an expert witness report from the state- </p><p>run Turkish Radio and Television (TRT), which </p><p>made an analysis of the recordings of the songs, </p><p>saying that all the songs were about love, nature </p><p>and longing.  TRT also provided the court with a </p><p>translation of the songs as well.  The National </p><p>Education Ministry had dismissed five of the </p><p>seven teachers.  The teachers for whom prison </p><p>terms of three years and nine months are </p><p>requested may now be reinstated.  The other two </p><p>suspects, Hayrettin Altun and Medeni Alpkaya, are </p><p>charged with "delivering speeches in support of </p><p>the PKK\'s Kurdish-language education campaign and </p><p>displaying pro-mother tongue education banners." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  RUSSIAN INVESTMENT IN KILIS </p><p>(Turkiye)  Russian firm Kornet and the Kilis </p><p>Governor\'s Office signed a protocol agreement to </p><p>establish a factory that will produce champagne </p><p>and wine.  Kilis Governor Aslan Kutuk said the </p><p>factory, which is expected to go on line within </p><p>two years, would cost USD 20 million to build and </p><p>create 400 new jobs.  Kornet\'s Turkish partner </p><p>Alaattin Sucu indicated the factory would process </p><p>100,000 tons of fresh grapes annually. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  REPAIR OF ADANA AIRPORT IMPACTS PROVINCIAL </p><p>ECONOMY </p><p>(Bolge)  Adana Tourism Director Zeki Yilmaz </p><p>predicted the closure of the Adana Airport to </p><p>flights due to repair and maintenance would cause </p><p>the provincial economy to suffer a loss of TL 1 </p><p>trillion (approx. USD 625,000).  The airport, </p><p>which went under renovation on November 4, is </p><p>expected to go back in service in mid-January. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.
