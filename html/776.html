TALKS WERE HELD OCTOBER 6-8 BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE </p><p>B-H, CROATIAN, AND TURKISH GOVERNMENTS TO ESTABLISH THE </p><p>FRAMEWORK FOR A TRILATERAL ENTITY THAT WOULD MONITOR THE </p><p>RIGHTS OF REFUGEES (ABDIC SUPPORTERS) WHO RETURN FROM </p><p>CROATIA TO THE VELIKA KLADUSA AREA.  TURKISH DELEGATION </p><p>HAS RETURNED TO ANKARA TO SEEK APPROVAL FOR PARTICIPATION </p><p>IN SUCH AN EFFORT.  SEVERAL DETAILS REMAIN UNSETTLED, BUT </p><p>ALL THREE GOVERNMENTS ARE WORKING QUICKLY TO GET THE ISSUE </p><p>RESOLVED SO THE REFUGEES CAN RETURN HOME BEFORE WINTER </p><p>SETS IN.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>TRYING TO BUILD TRUST </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE THE 22,000 REFUGEES FROM </p><p>VELIKA KLADUSA TO RETURN HOME VOLUNTARILY, THE CROATIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS DEVELOPED FURTHER ITS EARLIER IDEA TO </p><p>ESTABLISH A MONITORING FORCE COMPRISED OF POLICE FROM </p><p>TURKEY, CROATIA, AND BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA (FROM AN AREA </p><p>OUTSIDE OF BIHAC).  REPRESENTATIVES OF THE THREE </p><p>GOVERNMENTS MET IN CROATIA AND IN VELIKA KLADUSA OCTOBER </p><p>6-8 TO WORK OUT THE MODALITIES OF SUCH A MONITORING FORCE. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  03944  01 OF 02  101335Z </p><p> </p><p>3. ACCORDING TO THE PLAN, THE B-H GOVERNMENT WOULD AGREE </p><p>TO REMOVE THE V CORPS FROM THE AREA, PROVIDE WRITTEN </p><p>GUARANTEES OF THE RIGHTS THAT WILL BE GRANTED TO </p><p>RETURNEES, PARTICIPATE IN THE TRILATERAL MONITORING </p><p>EFFORT.  IT IS THE HOPE OF ALL PARTIES THAT WITH SUCH </p><p>PROVISIONS IN PLACE THE REFUGEES WILL VOLUNTARILY RETURN </p><p>TO THEIR HOMES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>RESULTS OF TRILATERAL DISCUSSIONS </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  ACCORDING TO THE TURKISH EMBASSY IN ZAGREB, THE TALKS </p><p>WERE BASICALLY POSITIVE, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NUMEROUS </p><p>DETAILS STILL TO BE DECIDED.  THE GROUPS DISCUSSED THE </p><p>MANDATE, DURATION, AND SIZE OF THE FORCE, AND IT WAS </p><p>DECIDED THAT </p><p> </p><p>-- THE PARTICIPANTS WILL ONLY MONITOR; THEY ARE NOT IN A </p><p>POSITION TO ENFORCE.  VIOLATIONS WOULD BE REPORTED TO THE </p><p>B-H GOVERNMENT; ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTION WOULD BE THE </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE RATIO WILL BE 50 PERCENT BOSNIAN, 25 PERCENT </p><p>CROATIAN, AND 25 PERCENT TURKISH. </p><p>-- THE TERRITORY TO BE COVERED IS APPROXIMATELY 400 SQUARE </p><p>KILOMETERS, INCLUDING VELIKA KLADUSA AND SEVERAL VILLAGES </p><p>NEAR CAZIN. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  03944  01 OF 02  101335Z </p><p>ISSUES STILL PENDING </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE SIZE OF THE FORCE HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED, BUT </p><p>POSSIBILITIES RANGED FROM 100 TO 200 POLICE OFFICERS.  (WE </p><p>HAD HEARD ORIGINALLY THAT THE FORCE WOULD CONSIST OF ABOUT </p><p>150 INDIVIDUALS.) </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE LARGEST UNRESOLVED ISSUE, HOWEVER, IS THE MATTER </p><p>OF WRITTEN, ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS FROM THE B-H GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THE REFUGEES ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE AMNESTY THAT HAS </p><p>BEEN ANNOUNCED BY SARAJEVO.  THEY WANT SPECIFIC GUARANTEES </p><p>IN WRITING THAT COVER SUCH TOPICS AS NO PROSECUTION FOR </p><p>WAR CRIMES, NO CONSCRIPTION INTO THE MILITARY, RETURN OF </p><p>ALL PROPERTY THAT HAS BEEN SEIZED BY OTHERS (REFUGEES FROM </p><p>BANJA LUKA WHO WERE BUSED INTO THE BIHAC AREA BY THE </p><p>CROATIAN GOVERNMENT), EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, ETC. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>THE NEED FOR SPEED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ2215 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ2215 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  03944  02 OF 02  101336Z </p><p>ACTION PRM-10 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-01  CA-02    CIAE-00  OASY-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      ANHR-01  SRPP-00  EUR-01   OIGO-01  HHS-01   TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-00    L-01     ADS-00   NSAE-00  OIC-02   DRL-09     /029W </p><p>                  ------------------F4B75F  101336Z /38 </p><p>O 101330Z OCT 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 7554 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USLO SKOPJE </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 003944 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR PRM, IO/PHO, EUR/EEA, EUR/SCE </p><p> </p><p>STATE ALSO PASS AID </p><p> </p><p>AID FOR AA/BHR, ENI, BHR/FFP, AND BHR/OFDA/DRD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PREF, PHUM, BK, HR, TU, UNHCR </p><p>SUBJECT:  REFUGEES FROM VELIKA KLADUSA - SLOW PROGRESS ON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  03944  02 OF 02  101336Z </p><p>ESTABLISHING SAFEGUARDS FOR RETURN </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7.
