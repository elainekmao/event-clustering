<p>UNCLAS STATE 184826 </p><p> </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </p><p> </p><p>INFORM CONSULS, PASS PAO\'S, CENTCOM FOR POLAD LOWRIE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:        OPRC, PTER, LE </p><p>SUBJECT:     BACKGROUND BRIEFING ON TWA HIJACKING </p><p>             MONDAY, JUNE 17, 1985, </p><p> </p><p>1.  FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF BACKGROUND BRIEFING ON TWA </p><p>HIJACKING ON JUNE 17 GIVEN BY ROBERT OAKLEY: </p><p></p><p>BEGIN TEXT: </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL:  I\'M GOING TO HAVE TO BE </p><p>VERY, VERY BRIEF BECAUSE WE HAVE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO, </p><p>AND I\'VE GOT SOME OTHER MEETINGS TO GO TO.  AND, </p><p>OBVIOUSLY, OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO DO EVERYTHING WE </p><p>CAN TO GET THESE PEOPLE LOOSE, WHICH ALSO WILL HAVE </p><p>SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT HOW MUCH I CAN RESPOND TO YOUR </p><p>QUESTIONS. </p><p></p><p>LET ME OPEN BY REPEATING THE STATEMENT WHICH YOU ALL HAVE </p><p>HEARD FREQUENTLY, INCLUDING FROM LARRY SPEAKES THIS </p><p>MORNING: </p><p></p><p>WE DO NOT MAKE CONCESSIONS TO TERRORISTS.  WE DO NOT ASK </p><p>OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO DO SO -- ISRAEL, KUWAIT, WHOEVER </p><p>THEY MAY BE.  WE ARE CONTINUING OUR INTENSIVE EFFORTS TO </p><p></p><p>SECURE THE RELEASE OF ALL THE PASSENGERS TAKEN HOSTAGE IN </p><p>LAST FRIDAY\'S HIJACKING.  WE\'RE GRATEFUL TO THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF ALGERIA FOR THEIR EXTENSIVE EFFORTS WHICH </p><p>HAVE RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF 87 OF THE HOSTAGES. </p><p></p><p>DISCUSSIONS WERE HELD YESTERDAY AND RESUMED THIS MORNING </p><p>BETWEEN THE HIJACKERS AND LEBANESE JUSTICE MINISTER NABIH </p><p>BERRI, WHO IS ALSO THE HEAD OF THE SHI\'A AMAL GROUP. </p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR BUD MCFARLANE HAS BEEN IN </p><p>TELEPHONE CONTACT WITH MINISTER BERRI.  OUR AMBASSADOR TO </p><p>BEIRUT, REG BARTHOLOMEW, HAS ALSO BEEN IN FREQUENT TOUCH </p><p>WITH MINISTER BARRI, AND OTHER RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS OF </p><p>THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT AND VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT </p><p>HAVE INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>THE PURPOSE OF THESE CONTACTS IS TO OBTAIN THE IMMEDIATE </p><p>RELEASE OF ALL THE REMAINING PRISONERS; THOSE WHO WERE </p><p>TAKEN OFF THE PLANE EARLIER, THOSE WHO APPEAR TO HAVE </p><p>BEEN TAKEN OFF THE PLANE LAST NIGHT, ALL THE REMAINING </p><p>PRISONERS WHO HAVEN\'T ALREADY BEEN RELEASED WHO WERE ON </p><p>THAT PLANE WHEN IT WAS HIJACKED. </p><p></p><p>WE\'VE ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH A VARIETY OF OTHER </p><p>GOVERNMENTS AND PARTIES TO ENLIST THEIR ASSISTANCE IN </p><p>SECURING THE SAFE RELEASE OF ALL THE HOSTAGES.  WE HOPE </p><p>THIS TRAGIC SITUATION WILL BE RESOLVED AS SOON AS </p><p>POSSIBLE BY THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.  ITS </p><p>CONTINUATION DOES NO ONE ANY GOOD.  THE INNOCENT VICTIMS </p><p>OF THIS ACT OF TERRORISM ARE SUFFERING NEEDLESSLY AS ARE </p><p>THEIR FAMILIES. </p><p></p><p>THE HIJACKERS ARE NOT GETTING SYMPATHY FOR THEIR </p><p>DEMANDS.  INDEED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE HIJACKING, AND </p><p>THE WAY IN WHICH THEY HAVE LINKED THE RELEASE OF THE </p><p>FORMER ANSAR PRISONERS, MAY DELAY THE PREVIOUSLY PLANNED </p><p>RELEASE OF THESE PRISONERS, AS STATED BY ISRAEL. </p><p></p><p>WELL, THAT\'S MY STATEMENT.  I\'LL BE HAPPY TO TRY TO </p><p>ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS. </p><p></p><p>Q.  HOW MANY HOSTAGES ARE THERE NOW, INCLUDING THE CREW, </p><p>AND DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WE DO NOT KNOW PRECISELY </p><p>WHERE THEY ARE.  I\'LL HAVE TO GET YOU THE PRECISE FIGURE </p><p>ON THE NUMBER OF HOSTAGES. </p><p></p><p>Q.  YOU\'VE MENTIONED ONE THING -- THE PRISONERS THAT WERE </p><p>TAKEN OFF THE PLANE FRIDAY, AND THOSE, YOU SAID, APPEAR </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF TODAY. </p><p>DO WE NOT KNOW FOR SURE THAT THEY ARE IN NABIH BERRI\'S -- </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WE THINK THAT THEY HAVE </p><p>BEEN TAKEN OFF THE PLANE.  WE HAVE NO INDEPE DENT </p><p>CONFIRMATION, BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE.  THERE\'S BEEN </p><p>NO ACTIVITY ON BOARD THE PLANE, AND WE THINK THEY\'RE </p><p>OFF.  WE CAN\'T SAY FOR SURE THAT THEY\'RE ALL OFF.  I\'LL </p><p>JUST SAY IT\'S A QUESTION OF NOT HAVING INDEPENDENT </p><p>CONFIRMATION.  WE BELIEVE THEY\'RE OFF. </p><p></p><p>Q.  WHAT DOES BERRI TELL YOU ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE THEY\'RE </p><p>SUPPOSED TO BE UNDER HIS CONTROL, ARE THEY NOT? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  BARRY SAYS THEY\'RE UNDER </p><p>HIS CONTROL. </p><p></p><p>Q.  IF THEY ARE, HOW DOES THIS COMPLICATE THINGS? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  EXCUSE ME? </p><p></p><p>Q.  IF THEY ARE OFF THE PLANE, IF ALL THE PRISONERS OR </p><p>ALL THE HOSTAGES ARE OFF THE PLANE, FROM OUR POINT OF </p><p>VIEW, HOW DOES THIS COMPLICATE THINGS OR DOES IT </p><p>COMPLICATE THINGS? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THE QUESTION IS NOT SO </p><p>MUCH WHERE THEY ARE.  THE QUESTION IS, ARE THEY GOING TO </p><p>BE RELEASED?  IF BERRI HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>THEM, THIS IS FINE.  IT\'S NICE TO SEE SOMEONE IN A </p><p>POSITION OF RESPONSIBILITY STEP FORWARD AND ACCEPT IT. </p><p></p><p>OUR POSITION IS, THAT BEING THE CASE THE PRISONERS -- THE </p><p>HOSTAGES SHOULD BE RELEASED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE; NOT </p><p>BEING HELD UP FOR SOME SORT OF NEGOTIATION, CONCESSIONS, </p><p>TRADE OR HAGGLING. </p><p></p><p>Q.  IS IT YOUR INFORMATION THAT BERRI KNEW ABOUT THIS </p><p>OPERATION BEFORE IT STARTED, OR WAS HE PART OF THE </p><p>PLANNING OF IT? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THOSE OF WHO HAVE BEEN </p><p>FOLLOWING THIS THING, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE </p><p>BEEN OUT TO BEIRUT AT ONE TIME OR OTHER, KNOW JUST HOW </p><p>DIFFICULT IT IS TO SAY WHO KNEW WHAT, WHEN, I JUST CAN\'T </p><p> </p><p>ANSWER THAT QUESTION. </p><p></p><p>Q.  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE ONES WHO WERE TAKEN OFF THE </p><p>PLANE IN ITS SECOND STOP IN BEIRUT AND THOSE WHO APPEAR </p><p>TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF LAST NIGHT ARE NOW TOGETHER?  DO </p><p>YOU HAVE ANY INDICATION FROM BERRI THAT THEY\'VE BEEN </p><p>REUNITED? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WE DON\'T KNOW EXCEPT </p><p>BERRI\'S STATEMENT, THAT HE IS ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR </p><p>ALL OF THEM.  WHETHER THEY\'RE ALL PHYSICALLY TOGETHER OR </p><p>NOT, I COULDN\'T TELL YOU. </p><p></p><p>Q.  WHAT ABOUT THE ONES THAT WERE THERE PREVIOUSLY, THE </p><p>NINE OR - </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THERE\'S NO REASON TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER WITH THE PEOPLE </p><p>WHO WERE ON THE TWA FLIGHT.  SO FAR THE - THERE HAS BEEN </p><p>NO MENTION OF THE DAWA PRISONERS IN KUWAIT IN CONNECTION </p><p>WITH THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE TWA FLIGHT. </p><p></p><p>Q.  WHEN THE ISRAELIS TRANSFERRED THOSE DETAINEES, THE </p><p>LEBANESE SHI\'ITES, TO ISRAEL, WE INFORMED THEM THAT THEY </p><p>WERE IN VIOLATION, I THINK, OF INTERNATIONAL LAW -- I </p><p>THINK THE FOURTH GENEVA PROTOCOL.  WHAT WOULD BE SO WRONG </p><p>WITH JUST REMINDING THEM AGAIN THAT THEY ARE HOLDING </p><p>THOSE DETAINEES IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  OUR POSITION HAS NOT </p><p>CHANGED.  THAT THEY WERE TRANSFERRED FROM ISRAEL TO </p><p>LEBANON.  IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE OPPOSED AS </p><p>INCONSISTENT WITH THE FOURTH GENEVA CONVENTION.  BUT WE </p><p>DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY REASON TO LINK THESE TWO </p><p>QUESTIONS.  INDEED, WE OPPOSE SUCH LINKAGE.  AND, AS I\'VE </p><p>SAID, THE PRACTICAL EFFECT IS GOING TO BE, WE THINK, TO </p><p>DELAY THE RELEASE WHICH THE ISRAELIS HAD PREVIOUSLY </p><p>PLANNED. </p><p></p><p>Q.  IF WE WON\'T ASK THE ISRAELIS TO LET THEM GO, AND THE </p><p>ISRAELIS WON\'T LET THEM GO UNTIL WE ASK THEM TO DO IT, </p><p>DON\'T THE HOSTAGES SUFFER IN THE MEANTIME WHILE WE TRY </p><p>AND WORK OUT A FACE-SAVING COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE TWO </p><p>POSITIONS? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WELL, OUR POSITION, AS I </p><p>SAID, IS QUITE CLEAR AND WE\'RE NOT CHANGING IT. </p><p></p><p>Q.  TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE, ARE THE PEOPLE -- </p><p></p><p>Q.  HAD WE KNOWN BEFORE THE HIJACKING THAT THE ISRAELIS </p><p>PLANNED TO RELEASE THESE SHI\'ITE PRISONERS? </p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THE ISRAELIS HAVE </p><p>CONSISTENTLY SAID THAT THEY INTENDED TO RELEASE THESE </p><p>FORMER PRISONERS OF THE ANSAR CAMP OVER TIME, AS THE </p><p>SECURITY SITUATION IN SOUTHERN LEBANON IMPROVES. </p><p></p><p>Q.  TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE, ARE ALL THE </p><p>REMAINING HOSTAGES AMERICAN?  AMAL WAS SAYING THERE </p><p>WERE FOUR GREEK CITIZENS WITH THEM.  DO YOU HAVE ANY </p><p>IDEA ON THE NATIONALITY BREAKDOWN? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I\'LL HAVE TO GET THAT </p><p>FOR YOU.  WE DO HAVE THAT INFORMATION SOMEWHERE AND WE </p><p>CAN GET IT. </p><p></p><p>Q.  IN THE COURSE OF YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH BERRI, </p><p>DOES HE SAY, DOES HE REPEAT THE DEMANDS OF THE </p><p>HIJACKERS? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WE\'RE NOT NEGOTIATING </p><p>WITH BERRI.  I BELIEVE THAT HE HAS POINTED OUT THE </p><p>DEMANDS OF THE HIJACKERS, AT LEAST; WHETHER HE HAS </p><p>ENDORSED THEM OR NOT, I\'M NOT QUITE SURE.  BUT OUR </p><p>POSITION ON THAT REMAINS VERY CLEAR. </p><p></p><p>Q.  WELL IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU\'RE SAYING THAT IF </p><p>BERRI HAS CONTROL OF THESE PEOPLE, THEN IT WOULD BE </p><p>WITHIN HIS POWER TO RELEASE THEM, RIGHT? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  BERRI - </p><p></p><p>Q.  SO IF HE DOES NOT RELEASE THEM, HE IS MAKING </p><p>DEMANDS UPON THE UNITED STATES, IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. </p><p>COULD YOU CITE WHAT THOSE DEMANDS ARE? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THE ONLY DEMANDS THAT </p><p>HAVE BEEN MADE, SO FAR AS I KNOW, ARE FOR THE RELEASE </p><p>OF THE FORMER ANSAR PRISONERS, AND OUR ANSWER IS VERY </p><p>CLEAR, "WE DON\'T GIVE IN TO TERRORIST DEMANDS." </p><p>ON THE OTHER HAND, AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT, THERE WAS A </p><p>TIMETABLE FOR THEIR RELEASE.  UNFORTUNATELY, THESE TWO </p><p>THINGS HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER AND THEY SHOULDN\'T BE PUT </p><p>TOGETHER.  THE PRISONERS SHOULD BE RELEASED AT ONCE. </p><p></p><p>Q.  TO CLARIFY THAT, ARE YOU SAYING THAT BERRI </p><p>SPECIFICALLY HAS ASKED FOR THE RELEASE OF THE 766 </p><p>HIMSELF? </p><p> </p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THAT I\'LL HAVE TO </p><p>CHECK. </p><p></p><p>Q.  HAVE YOU ASKED BERRI -- SINCE HE ASSUMES </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY -- HAVE YOU ASKED HIM SPECIFICALLY TO </p><p>PLEASE GET THE PRISONERS RELEASED? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THAT WAS THE THRUST OF </p><p>THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN MCFARLANE AND BERRI. </p><p></p><p>Q.  AND WHAT DID BERRI REPLY TO THAT, SINCE HE SAYS HE </p><p>HAS RESPONSIBILITY? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I CAN\'T GET INTO THE </p><p>DETAILS OF THE CONVERSATION, BUT THAT INDEED OBVIOUSLY </p><p>THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED. </p><p></p><p>Q.  IS IT CLEAR TO YOU THROUGH TALKS WITH MR. BERRI </p><p>THAT HE IS TALKING TO YOU IN HIS CAPACITY AS A LEADER </p><p>OF AMAL, OR IN HIS CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF THE LEBANESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  SO FAR AS I KNOW, HE </p><p>HASN\'T MADE THE DISTINCTION.  FORTUNATELY, IN TERMS OF </p><p>ACCEPTING SOME RESPONSIBILITY, HE HAS BOTH POSITIONS, </p><p>SO HE IS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS </p><p>A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SHI\'A COMMUNITY.  AND LET ME </p><p>REMIND YOU, THE SHI\'A </p><p>A COMMUNITY HAS SUFFERED ENORMOUSLY OVER MANY YEARS OF </p><p>VIOLENCE AND CONFLICT AND DEPRIVATION. </p><p></p><p>THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS SUPPORTED </p><p>POLITICAL RECONCILIATION AND REFORM AMONG THE LEBANESE </p><p>COMMUNITIES, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE ALL OF THEM WITH </p><p>EQUITABLE POLITICAL DISTRIBUTION.  SO NABIH BERRI, AS A </p><p>RESPONSIBLE  LEADER OF THE SHI\'A COMMUNITY, HAS OUR </p><p>APPRECIATION.  NABIH BERRI, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS ACCEPTED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE PRISONERS, HAS </p><p>DONE SOMETHING WE CONSIDER TO BE POSITIVE.  BUT NOW WE </p><p>CALL UPON HIM, AS WE HAVE, TO BRING ABOUT THEIR RELEASE. </p><p></p><p>Q.  THE SITUATION, IN LIGHT OF YOUR ANSWERS IN THE LAST </p><p>FEW QUESTIONS, SEEM TO HAVE CHANGED -- IT\'S NO LONGER A </p><p>HIJACKING; IT IS A SITUATION IN WHICH A LEBANESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL IS CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE </p><p>POSSESSION OR THE CARE-TAKING OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES. </p><p>HAS THIS CHANGED THE SITUATION IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>VIEW?YOU\'RE NOW DEALING WITH ANOTHER GOVERNMENT THAT </p><p>HAS CONTROL OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES.  IS THIS IN ANY WAY </p><p>SIMILAR TO THE GOVERNMENT-TO"GOVERNMENT SITUATION THAT </p><p>OCCURRED IN IRAN? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THIS GETS BACK TO THE </p><p>PREVIOUS QUESTION, WHICH I COULDN\'T ANSWER, IS THE WAY </p><p>IN WHICH NABIH BERRI IS SPEAKING AS A LEADER OF THE </p><p>SHI\'A COMMUNITY OR AS A MEMBER OF THE LEBANESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT?  AND IT\'S A VERY INTERESTING SITUATION.  I </p><p>CAN\'T SPEAK TO WHAT DEGREE HE\'S SPEAKING AS ONE; TO </p><p>WHAT DEGREE HE\'S SPEAKING AS ANOTHER.  BUT YOU ALL </p><p>UNDERSTAND THE VERY LIMITED CONTROL WHICH THE LEBANESE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, AS AN INSTITUTION, HAS OVER WEST BEIRUT. </p><p></p><p>Q.  DO YOU KNOW WHETHER BERRI ACTUALLY DOES HAVE </p><p>CONTROL OVER THE HOSTAGES? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  NO. </p><p></p><p>Q.  IN LIGHT OF THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE PAST 24 HOURS, </p><p>WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS "MORE OPTIMISTIC" OR </p><p>"LESS OPTIMISTIC" ABOUT GETTING THESE HOSTAGES SAFELY </p><p>RELEASED? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I WOULD DESCRIBE </p><p>MYSELF AS NEITHER.  I HAVEN\'T BEEN MORE OR LESS.  AND </p><p>ALL WE CAN DO IS WORK AT IT WITHOUT MAKING ANY VALUE </p><p>JUDGMENTS UNTIL THEY\'RE RELEASED.  THEN -- </p><p></p><p>Q.  THIS CHANGE MEANS NOTHING IN TERMS OF IT BEING MORE </p><p>LIKELY THAT THESE PEOPLE WILL BE RELEASED SAFELY? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  ONE CAN DEDUCE A WHOLE </p><p>HOST OF ARGUMENTS POINTING BOTH WAYS, PLUSES AND </p><p>MINUSES, IF YOU WILL.  YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THEY ARE </p><p>SAFER AT THE MOMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT DOES NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY MEANS THAT THEIR RELEASE IS MORE LIKELY. </p><p></p><p>Q.  WHAT\'S THE DIFFERENCE IN PRINCIPLE BETWEEN THE </p><p>ISRAELI RELEASE OF A BUNCH OF CONVICTED TERRORISTS AND </p><p>GANGSTERS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND THIS OPERATION? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THAT\'S SOMETHING </p><p>YOU\'LL HAVE TO ASK THE ISRAELIS, NOT ME. </p><p></p><p>Q.  SIR, CAN I GO BACK TO MY QUESTION ABOUT MR. BERRI\'S </p><p>CONTROL FOR A MOMENT? </p><p> </p><p>Q.  SIR, COULD YOU TELL ME IF THE UNITED STATES OPPOSES </p><p>HAVING ISRAEL RELEASE THESE PRISONERS WHILE AMERICAN </p><p>HOSTAGES ARE STILL BEING HELD? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  OUR POSITION, I THINK, </p><p>IS VERY CLEAR.  WE DO NOT MAKE CONCESSIONS TO </p><p>TERRORISTS.  WE DO NOT ENCOURAGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO </p><p>DO SO.  THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT PREVIOUSLY HAD A PLAN </p><p>FOR THE RELEASE OF THE TERRORIST -- NOT OF THE </p><p>TERRORISTS, BUT OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE FORMER ANSAR </p><p>CAMP. </p><p></p><p>Q.  DOES -- </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WHAT IT DOES, WE WILL </p><p>SEE. </p><p></p><p>Q.  DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE UNITED STATES DOES OPPOSE </p><p>HAVING ISRAEL RELEASE THESE PRISONERS WHILE THE </p><p>HOSTAGES ARE -- </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  NO.  I DIDN\'T SAY </p><p>THAT.  I JUST REPEATED OUR POSITION. </p><p></p><p>Q.  COULD YOU SAY IF THE UNITED STATES DOES OPPOSE IT, </p><p>SIR? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  OUR POSITION IS VERY </p><p>CLEAR.  WE DO NOT MAKE CONCESSIONS WITH TERRORISTS.  WE </p><p>DON\'T ENCOURAGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO DO SO. </p><p></p><p>Q.  BUT IF THE ISRAELIS WERE INDEPENDENTLY TO DECIDE </p><p>NOW TO RELEASE THOSE HOSTAGES, WOULD YOU OPPOSE THAT? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  IF THEY WERE TO </p><p>INDEPENDENTLY DECIDE TO DO SO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR </p><p>PLAN PREVIOUSLY, IT WOULD PRODUCE PERHAPS A DIFFERENT </p><p>SITUATION, IF IT WERE NOT LINKED TO THE QUESTION OF THE </p><p>TERRORISTS.  BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE HIJACKERS SHOULD </p><p>DROP THEIR DEMANDS FOR -- WHICH INCLUDE THE LINKAGE </p><p>HERE. </p><p></p><p>Q.  HAVE WE TOLD BERRI THAT THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THE </p><p>HOSTAGE SITUATION IS TO DELAY THE RETURN OF THE </p><p>PRISONERS IN ISRAEL?  DID WE ACTUALLY TELL HIM THAT? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  IF YOU LISTENED TO THE </p><p>(SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL) BACKGROUNDER THIS </p><p>MORNING, HE TALKS ABOUT THAT.  HE SAYS THAT IF THE </p><p>HOSTAGE SITUATION WERE TO BE CLEARED UP, IT MIGHT BE </p><p>POSSIBLE FOR THE ISRAELIS TO PROCEED ON THEIR </p><p>PREVIOUSLY PLANNED RELEASE OF THE LEBANESE PRISONERS. </p><p></p><p>Q.  BUT DID WE TELL BERRI THIS? </p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  (SENIOR ADMINISTRATION </p><p>OFFICIAL) WAS TALKING ABOUT MCFARLANE\'S CONVERSATION </p><p>WITH BERRI. </p><p></p><p>Q.  YOU, A FEW MINUTES AGO, TALKED ABOUT THE PLUSES AND </p><p>MINUSES OF THE NEW SITUATION.  DOESN\'T THE FACT THAT </p><p>THEY\'RE OFF THE PLANE AND SOME PLACE THAT WE DON\'T KNOW </p><p>WHERE THEY ARE, MEAN THAT THEY COULD BE SUSTAINED FOR A </p><p>LONGER PERIOD OF TIME, SEPARATED PERHAPS -- </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  MY COMMENT, I SAID IN </p><p>SOME WAYS THEY MAY BE SAFER, IN OTHER WAYS IT DOES NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEIR RELEASE IS MORE IMMINENT. </p><p>BUT YOU COULD TURN IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND AND SAY THAT </p><p>NABIH BERRI AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER OF THE SHI\'A </p><p>COMMUNITY AS WELL AS A MINISTER HAS ACCEPTED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY.  THEREFORE, IF HE IS WILLING TO </p><p>EXERCISE THAT RESPONSIBILITY, THIS COULD LEAD TO THEIR </p><p>EARLY RELEASE RATHER THAN DEALING WITH A BUNCH OF </p><p>HIJACKERS WHO HAVE NO SUCH PERSON IN A POSITION OF </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY.  THAT\'S WHY I SAID YOU GOT PLUSES AND </p><p>MINUSES. </p><p></p><p>Q.  FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS A COUNTER-TERRORIST </p><p>OFFICIAL -- </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I DON\'T WANT TO GET IN </p><p>ANY SORT OF VALUE JUDGMENTS. </p><p></p><p>Q.  WELL, WHAT IS EFFECTIVELY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN </p><p>BERRI HOLDING AMERICAN PASSENGERS AS HOSTAGES TO </p><p>CERTAIN POLITICAL DEMANDS AND THE ORIGINAL HIJACKERS </p><p>HOLDING THE AMERICAN PASSENGERS HOSTAGE -- </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  OUR POSITION -- </p><p></p><p>Q.  -- TO THE SAME DEMAND? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  MARVIN, OUR POSITION </p><p>IS EXACTLY THE SAME.  WE WANT THEM RELEASED AT ONCE, NO </p><p>CONDITIONS ASKED. </p><p></p><p>Q.  YOU ARE AT THE SAME TIME REFERRING TO BERRI AS A </p><p>RESPONSIBLE SHI\'ITE LEADER. </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  YES. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>Q.  HOW RESPONSIBLE IS HE IF HE IS IN FACT, IN EFFECT, </p><p> PERFORMING THE SAME FUNCTION AS THE ORIGINAL HIJACKERS? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  MARVIN, THAT\'S WHY WE </p><p>HAVE SAID, IN OUR VIEW RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT MERELY TO </p><p>KEEP THEM SAFE BUT TO RELEASE THEM AT ONCE. </p><p>Q.  AS A FOLLOW-UP TO THE "- </p><p></p><p>Q.  THEN DOES THE PRESIDENT\'S THREAT TO FREE THE </p><p>HOSTAGES FOR THE UNSAFETY OF THOSE HOLDING THEM STILL </p><p>HOLD? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THAT\'S A SUBJECT THAT </p><p>I REALLY CAN\'T COMMENT ON, GIVEN THE SENSITIVITY OF THE </p><p>SITUATION WE\'RE IN. </p><p></p><p>Q.  HAVE YOU MADE CLEAR TO MR. BERRI THAT WE WANT ALL </p><p>OF THE HOSTAGES RELEASED, AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WITHOUT </p><p>DISTINCTION BETWEEN OFFICIALS, NON-OFFICIALS, MILITARY, </p><p>NON-MILITARY, JEW, NON-JEW? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  YES. </p><p></p><p>Q.  AND SO THAT INCLUDES THE SIX OR EIGHT THAT WERE </p><p>TAKEN OFF THE PLANE - </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  INDEED. </p><p></p><p>Q.  - FRIDAY NIGHT.  IT DOES NOT - </p><p></p><p>Q.  MR. -- </p><p></p><p>Q.  BUT JUST TO UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY, IT DOES NOT </p><p>NECESSARILY INCLUDE THE SEVEN AMERICANS WHO ARE -- </p><p>STILL REMAIN HOSTAGE IN SOME OTHER PART OF LEBANON? </p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  BERRI HAS CLAIMED NO </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM.  WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH </p><p>BERRI, WITH ALL OF THE RESPONSIBLE OR INFLUENTIAL, IF </p><p>YOU WANT TO PUT IT THAT WAY, LEADERS IN LEBANON ON THE </p><p>SUBJECT OF THE OTHER HOSTAGES OVER A LONG PERIOD OF </p><p>TIME.  BUT THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THIS, ALTHOUGH HE IS </p><p>ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE\'VE TALKED TO ABOUT THIS ABOUT </p><p>THE OTHER PROBLEM. </p><p></p><p>Q.  WHAT ROLE SYRIA PLAYS SINCE THEY ARE KNOWN FOR </p><p>THEIR GOOD RELATIONS WITH NABIH BERRI? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I DON\'T WANT TO </p><p>COMMENT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SYRIA AND NABIH </p><p>BERRI -- </p><p></p><p>Q.  HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO -- </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  -- EXCEPT THAT WE </p><p>THINK, REFERRING TO PRESIDENT ASSAD\'S STATEMENT, PUBLIC </p><p>STATEMENT OF LAST WEEK, HE HAS TALKED ABOUT HIS VIEWS </p><p>ON THE HOSTAGES, ON THE WHOLE IDEA OF HOSTAGE-TAKING </p><p>AND KIDNAPPING AND TERRORISM, WHERE HE SAYS HE OPPOSES </p><p>IT. </p><p></p><p>MR. DJEREJIAN:  WE\'RE GOING TO TAKE TWO MORE QUESTIONS. </p><p></p><p>Q.  HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO PRECISELY DEFINE THE </p><p>AFFILIATION OF THE HIJACKERS? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  NO. </p><p> </p><p>Q.  JUST A MINOR CLARIFICATION:  DOES THE UNITED STATES </p><p>HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT BERRI HAS INFLUENCE OVER </p><p>THE SIX TO TEN PEOPLE THAT WERE INITIALLY REMOVED OFF </p><p>THE PLANE? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  BERRI HAS CLAIMED </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF THEM.  THEREFORE, WE DO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT BERRI HAS INFLUENCE.  CONTROL, INFLUENCE. </p><p>THE DEGREE OF CONTROL, THE DEGREE OF INFLUENCE, IS </p><p>SOMETHING THAT\'S VERY HARD TO SAY. </p><p></p><p>Q.  HOW MUCH BERRI HAS INFLUENCE ON THE HIJACKERS? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  EXCUSE ME? </p><p></p><p>Q.  HOW MUCH BERRI HAS INFLUENCE ON THE HIJACKERS? </p><p></p><p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THAT\'S WHAT I SAID. </p><p>HOW MUCH IS HARD TO TELL. </p><p></p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>SHULTZ </p><p></p></div>
