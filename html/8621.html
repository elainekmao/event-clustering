<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 002545 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT:  KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION SPECIAL, JUNE 10: GOVERNMENT </p><p>FILES CHARGES AGAINST EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF LEADING DAILY </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT (C)02293 </p><p> </p><p>1.    SUMMARY: All media report that Mohammed al-Jassim, the </p><p>liberal editor-in-chief of Kuwaiti Arabic daily "Al Watan," </p><p>was summoned to the office of the public prosecutor and </p><p>charged with "contesting the authority of the Amir," a </p><p>charge that can carry a five-year prison term, before being </p><p>released on bail.  Media reports allege that al-Jassim </p><p>accused the ruling Al-Sabah family of interfering in the run- </p><p>up to the July 5 parliamentary elections. In a front-page </p><p>editorial in al-Watan, al-Jassim denies the charges as </p><p>politically motivated. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Jassim has led local media opposition to a proposed press </p><p>law that would give the government wide powers to fine or </p><p>close newspapers (reftel.) The charges against him have </p><p>predictably unleashed a torrent of criticism by liberals and </p><p>conservatives against the government, led by al-Jassim </p><p>himself.  "Referring me to the Public Prosecutor gives me </p><p>the freedom to express my opinion, " he writes in al-Watan. </p><p>"I want this to be an opportunity to judge the current </p><p>political situation in this country." END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: All newspapers report on June 9 that </p><p>editor-in-chief of Arabic daily Al-Watan and Arabic </p><p>Newsweek, Mohammed Abdul-Qader Al-Jassim, was referred to </p><p>the Public Prosecutor following statements he made in the </p><p>diwaniya [men\'s gathering] of MP Jassim Al-Omar criticizing </p><p>the ruling Al-Sabah family\'s alleged intervention in the run- </p><p>up to the July 5 parliamentary elections. </p><p> </p><p>On June 10, all newspapers report that Al-Jassim was </p><p>released on bail. Al-Jassim is accused of contesting the </p><p>authority of the Amir, a crime punishable by five years </p><p>imprisonment. Al-Jassim denies the charges against him. </p><p> </p><p>On Al-Watan\'s June 10 front page, Al-Jassim says in </p><p>addressing the Amir: "I apologize to you for a crime that I </p><p>have not committed." </p><p> </p><p>Al-Rai Al-Am front pages on June 10 the Minister of </p><p>Information, Ahmed Al-Fahd\'s comment on Al-Jassim\'s referral </p><p>to the Public Prosecutor: "[Al-Jassim\'s referral] was not </p><p>for an `opinion crime,\' and does not pertain to the press </p><p>law, [but rather] to criminal issues that concern the </p><p>Ministry of Interior." </p><p> </p><p>Following are reported reactions by prominent Kuwaitis: </p><p> </p><p>--Secretary General of the Islamic Constitutional Movement, </p><p>Essa Majed Al-Shaheen argues that the decision "reflects the </p><p>government\'s impatience with opposing views and leads us to </p><p>fear for the future of freedom in Kuwait." </p><p> </p><p>--Spokesman of the conservative Islamist Salafi Movement, </p><p>Abdul-Razzak Al-Shayji, warns against government </p><p>intervention in the elections, and states that the decision </p><p>to prosecute Al-Jassim violates rights to free expression. </p><p> </p><p>--Islamist MP Waleed Al-Tabtabaie feared that the decision </p><p>would be the first step towards "muffling mouths," and </p><p>called on the government to retract its decision. </p><p> </p><p>--Liberal MP Abdul-Wahab Al-Haroun called the decision "a </p><p>blatant violation of the constitution." </p><p> </p><p>-- The Committee for the Defense of Freedom of Expression at </p><p>the Kuwait Graduates\' Society denounced the referral of Al- </p><p>Jassim to the public prosecution on June 10. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>2.  "To Sheikh Sabah, with Best Regards" </p><p>Liberal Editor-in-Chief of Arabic daily Al-Watan and Arabic </p><p>Newsweek, Mohammad Al-Jassim, wrote (6/9):  "I understand </p><p>the `political\' reasons which forced the government to refer </p><p>me to the Public Prosecutor. It is, however, a decision in </p><p>my favor, since I will use it to stir public debate about </p><p>what is happening in Kuwait. I did not violate any laws </p><p>during the two seminars I participated in. I do admit, </p><p>however, that my `sin\' is having said something that </p><p>displeased [Acting Prime Minister] Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad and </p><p>those around him. The government wants to instill fear in my </p><p>heart, and the hearts of others, in order to stop us from </p><p>disclosing the ongoing machinations. If reforming the </p><p>country could be accomplished by referring me to the Public </p><p>Prosecutor, I would not mind if Sheikh Sabah referred me </p><p>there ten times daily. Violating laws and listening to those </p><p>with ill intentions is the road to destruction, not reform. </p><p>I do not fear the Public Prosecutor\'s investigations or the </p><p>courts, for I have spent over seventeen years in these same </p><p>courts defending others. In fact, I feel homesick for this </p><p>setting where one enjoys freedom of expression without </p><p>political grudges. Referring me to the Public Prosecutor </p><p>gives me the freedom to my opinion. I want this to be an </p><p>opportunity to judge the current political situation in this </p><p>country. I will say what my conscious dictates, without </p><p>hesitation, regardless of who is pleased or displeased." </p><p> </p><p>4.  "No To Violating Freedom of Expression" </p><p>Liberal Editor-in-Chief of Arabic daily Al-Qabas, Waleed Al- </p><p>Nesf wrote (6/9): "We did not expect the government to take </p><p>such severe action against the freedom of expression and </p><p>opinion. Regardless of our differences of opinion with Al- </p><p>Jassim. we strongly reject any infringement on the right to </p><p>free expression. In real democratic countries, elections are </p><p>the most important occasion for candidates and voters to </p><p>express their opinions on the future of their country. We </p><p>hope the government has not taken such action against a </p><p>citizen just for expressing his opinion. Such an action is </p><p>wrong and unjustified." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Do Not Make It a Prison Without Walls" </p><p>Fouad Al-Hashem wrote in independent Al-Watan (6/9):  "The </p><p>referral of Al-Jassim to the Public Prosecutor. is the </p><p>result of the . newly proposed press law. What Al-Jassim </p><p>said does not constitute a quarter of what is said in the </p><p>diwaniyas [weekly men\'s gatherings]. What has happened to </p><p>us? Have we lost our patience [with differing opinions]? The </p><p>free world is watching, so don\'t make these nations regret </p><p>having shed blood for our freedom, and for having stood up </p><p>to dictators to preserve our democracy. Don\'t turn Kuwait </p><p>into a prison without walls." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "President Bush, Thanks For Not Visiting Us" </p><p>Liberal Managing Editor Waleed Al-Jassim wrote in </p><p>independent Al-Watan (6/9):  "Thank you Mr. President for </p><p>not visiting us. We hope that you won\'t visit us any time </p><p>soon. Some may believe that I have suddenly turned against </p><p>America, but this is not true. Had the President visited </p><p>Kuwait. he would have heard about the government\'s attempts </p><p>to prevent freedom of expression, even during election </p><p>seminars-- one of the few remaining forms of democracy. </p><p>What Al-Jassim said is what people say in their homes and at </p><p>diwaniyas.  The government\'s calculations are mistaken, as </p><p>usual, for this decision is turning into a public call for </p><p>freedom of expression." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "The Smell of Injustice Will Not Spread" </p><p>Liberal Editor-in-Chief of Arabic daily Al-Watan and Arabic </p><p>Newsweek, Mohammad Al-Jassim, wrote (6/10):  "Kuwait today </p><p>is different from what people knew in the past because </p><p>politics have contaminated [the country] and the smell of </p><p>injustice had spread. The accusations against me can create </p><p>a bad image of Kuwait. However, Kuwait\'s image will not </p><p>change. and balance will be restored. With the return of the </p><p>political balance, the dust of agitation and hypocrisy that </p><p>obstructs vision will subside." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "Refer Us All To The Prosecutor" </p><p>Mubarak Al-Hajiri wrote in independent Al-Watan (6/10):  "At </p><p>the same time as Kuwait is hosting the first Arab Media </p><p>Forum [held in Kuwait from June 7-10], we notice that our </p><p>government has disregarded transparency and is extending its </p><p>long arm to muffle mouths of people who are attempting to </p><p>find remedies for [Kuwait\'s] chronic sickness. We do not </p><p>want to be afraid to express our opinions, especially if our </p><p>opinions are aimed at reform. We stand beside Al-Jassim and </p><p>reject and condemn such actions against him." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
