(U) Classified by Acting DCM Thomas E. Williams, </p><p>for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) UAE Ministry of Petroleum Director of Economic </p><p>Affairs and OPEC delegate Hamdan Al-Akbari told Acting </p><p>DCM June 9 that he believes oil market supply and </p><p>demand are balanced, current pricing is "adequate," </p><p>and cuts in OPEC quotas are not required at this time. </p><p>Almost all OPEC members which have the capacity to do </p><p>so continue to overproduce their quotas, despite the </p><p>last OPEC meeting\'s decision to raise quotas in hopes </p><p>members would curb output in accordance with the new </p><p>agreed output levels. (Note: Indeed, open source </p><p>reports indicate that the UAE is overproducing its </p><p>quota by as much as 130,000 barrels per day.  End </p><p>note.)  Al-Akbari thought it very possible that the </p><p>session would leave current quota levels untouched, </p><p>but might once again call on members to bring actual </p><p>production back into line with the agreed levels.  The </p><p>Emirati official suggested that concern about non-OPEC </p><p>market share would likely militate against any cut in </p><p>quotas. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) According to Al-Akbari, the June 11 meeting </p><p>was scheduled because of concerns about potential wild </p><p>price fluctuations resulting from the Iraq war (A/DCM </p><p>agreed that pessimists had predicted prices would </p><p>reach 40 USD a barrel during the war, and might crash </p><p>to 7-8 USD once the conflict ended).  While Iraq\'s </p><p>future impact on the oil market remains a concern, Al- </p><p>Akbari thought that the June 11 meeting would be </p><p>guided more by stock levels in the United States and </p><p>Europe, Venezuela\'s return to production, and would </p><p>focus on potential near-term downward pressures on </p><p>prices.  Iraq will likely become a major factor later </p><p>this year when its oil capabilities and production </p><p>schedule become clearer. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) A/DCM noted that with much of the OECD still </p><p>struggling to sustain positive economic growth, and </p><p>with the advent of the summer driving season in the </p><p>United States, it would be helpful if OPEC could </p><p>refrain from actions or statements that could </p><p>jeopardize the modest recovery which appears to be </p><p>underway.  While the oil intensity of OECD economies </p><p>has diminished markedly over the past decades, oil </p><p>prices continued to have a psychological impact on </p><p>consumer and even market sentiment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
