<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 002548 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR PM/CPP SWEBERG/ROSATI </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KSPR, MARR, MCAP, MOPS, PINS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR ASSESSMENT OF ENHANCED </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING CAPABILITIES (EIPC) PROGRAM IN </p><p>JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 99396 </p><p> </p><p>(U) The following answers are keyed to reftel questions A1-12. </p><p> </p><p>(A1) To date, 22 Jordanian trainers have been trained at CCMR </p><p>through the EIPC program.  Of this total, 15 received </p><p>training in 2001, 3 received training in 2002, and 4 received </p><p>training in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>(A2) The "train the trainer" concept has been successful. </p><p>The 22 trainers noted above have been able to deliver </p><p>improved training to 1,944 Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF) </p><p>personnel who have passed through its Peacekeeping Center </p><p>during the past year.  To our knowledge, all the individuals </p><p>who received CCMR training are currently serving as </p><p>instructors at the JAF Peacekeeping Center. </p><p> </p><p>(A3) Jordan has long been an enthusiastic participant in </p><p>international PKOs.  EIPC support -- by outfitting the JAF </p><p>Peacekeeping Center with computers, English language training </p><p>labs, and other training aids and equipment, and by improving </p><p>the curriculum of the instructors -- has ensured that </p><p>Jordanian Peacekeepers arrive in the field better prepared </p><p>for their mission than had been the case prior to the </p><p>beginning of this program. </p><p> </p><p>(A4) Jordan currently has 1,200 personnel deployed in UN </p><p>peacekeeping missions around the world, including in Eritrea, </p><p>Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone, and Georgia.  Additionally, </p><p>Jordan has deployed an additional 900 personnel to staff </p><p>field hospitals in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the West Bank which </p><p>are not part of UN PKOs. </p><p> </p><p>(A5) The JAF has said it would welcome additional EIPC funds </p><p>that would allow for training in the U.S. or other countries </p><p>that have state-of-the-art PK training facilities.  It also </p><p>had previously requested that EIPC funds be made available </p><p>for construction of a new building at its Peacekeeping </p><p>Center.  After being informed that EIPC funds could not be </p><p>used for that purpose, Jordan used national funds to </p><p>construct the building. </p><p> </p><p>(A6) Jordan would welcome ways for EIPC funds to be used to </p><p>enhance its role as a regional peacekeeping center, such as </p><p>funding training of other Middle East countries\' PK students </p><p>at the JAF training facility. </p><p> </p><p>(A7) Jordan has committed virtually all of its EIPC </p><p>allocations to training and purchases of equipment for its </p><p>Peacekeeping Center.  The Jordanians have complained, </p><p>however, about the extended time it takes to purchase and </p><p>deliver the equipment they have requested. </p><p> </p><p>(A8) No, Jordan has very limited resources to spend on </p><p>peacekeeping.  Jordan wants to become a regional PK training </p><p>center, but needs our help to achieve this goal. </p><p> </p><p>(A9) The JAF believes that it has developed a cadre of </p><p>well-trained Peacekeepers who have earned the professional </p><p>respect of counterparts around the world.  That said, given </p><p>Jordan\'s perennially strapped finances, access to future EIPC </p><p>funding would help ensure that the Jordanians continue to </p><p>benefit from up-to-date training techniques, curricula and </p><p>equipment. </p><p> </p><p>(A10) No, Jordan does not use FMS, EDA, IMET or other </p><p>non-EIPC security assistance funds to support its </p><p>peacekeeping activities. </p><p> </p><p>(A11) As noted above, Jordan sees itself as a regional leader </p><p>in the field of Peacekeeping and has long wanted to transform </p><p>its PK training facilities into a regional center that would </p><p>train personnel from other Middle East countries.  EIPC </p><p>support has helped that process along.  Regarding </p><p>deployments, EIPC support has bolstered and encouraged </p><p>Jordan\'s willingness to participate in PKOs around the world, </p><p>including in Eritrea, East Timor, Sierra Leone and Bosnia, </p><p>along with the more recent deployments of field hospitals in </p><p>Afghanistan and post-Saddam Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>(A12) N/A. </p><p> </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
