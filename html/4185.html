O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EPET, EFIN, ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe May Scrap Fuel Support </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified.  Protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: Reportedly smarting from a first-hand </p><p>encounter with dry fuel pumps, President Mugabe has </p><p>suggested parastatal NOCZIM may relinquish the job of </p><p>importing fuel to the private sector, bringing an end to </p><p>a costly and self-defeating fuel subsidy.   This would </p><p>require huge price increases at the pump, and let the GoZ </p><p>scapegoat foreign multinationals since it is </p><p>inconceivable that anyone would import anything at the </p><p>current GoZ-imposed price.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>A failed model </p><p>----------------- </p><p>2.  (U) Through NOCZIM, the GoZ has for years bought and </p><p>bartered for fuel abroad, then sold it to downstream </p><p>operators for a fraction of its value.  Foreign and </p><p>national oil firms are allowed a modest profit to </p><p>distribute the fuel.  In effect, the GoZ has been </p><p>underwriting NOCZIM\'s operating loss to keep fuel </p><p>artificially cheap (less than US$ .20/gallon at present). </p><p>With an accelerating Zimdollar devaluation and rampant </p><p>fuel smuggling to neighboring markets, the GoZ has run </p><p>out of foreign exchange to import fresh supplies.  So </p><p>desperate is the GoZ has kept the country running of late </p><p>by cutting off commercial over retail customers, </p><p>illegally pilfering Independent Petroleum Group (IPG) </p><p>fuel stored in Zimbabwe and pondering the sale of Air </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s fleet to raise hard currency. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  Mugabe has now hinted at scrapping this </p><p>unsustainable model.  Reportedly, he was enraged because </p><p>he was unable to find fuel for his own armored Mercedes </p><p>limousine while on a recent trip to Gweru.  He announced </p><p>last Thursday: </p><p> </p><p>"The fuel comes in the name of the government . . . We </p><p>call on multinational companies.  They sell and make </p><p>profits.  Government does not make any profit . . . [The </p><p>companies] don\'t suffer from the headaches and stomach </p><p>aches I suffer from . . . [Now] they must import and not </p><p>wait for the government to do it for them.  They have the </p><p>foreign exchange." </p><p> </p><p>Anti-profit and self-pity hyperbole aside, Mugabe is </p><p>admitting the GoZ can no longer cover NOCZIM\'s losses. </p><p>Although he does not address pricing, we assume - or at </p><p>least hope - the President appreciates that private </p><p>companies will not import fuel at a loss. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>----------- </p><p>4. (U) If Mugabe is serious, the GoZ is taking a </p><p>significant step forward by tacitly conceding that market </p><p>forces rather than price controls better serve the </p><p>country\'s future fuel needs (not to mention food and </p><p>exchange requirements).   But there\'s a problem:  The GoZ </p><p>is hard-pressed to justify steep hikes in fuel and </p><p>transport costs to an already pauperized population. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) A solution?  Mugabe could scapegoat foreign </p><p>firms - including Mobil and Caltex.  Word in the sector </p><p>is that new national companies close to the government </p><p>are anxious to gain market-share from better-established </p><p>multinationals.  (With many new indigenous operators </p><p>entering the sector, the number of downstream firms has </p><p>grown from 5 to 22 since 1999.)   In this worst-case </p><p>scenario, Mugabe would castigate multinationals for </p><p>higher fuel prices, just as he has blamed them for </p><p>shortages, then expropriate or force sale of their </p><p>assets.   He may have been laying this groundwork when he </p><p>bemoaned in the same remarks that "government cracks to </p><p>make [foreign oil companies] rich."  Mugabe has similarly </p><p>vilified and threatened to nationalize National Foods </p><p>over food shortages.  (The CEO of parent Anglo American </p><p>told us last week he is looking for an indigenous partner </p><p>to insulate National Foods from expropriation.)   In any </p><p>event, Mugabe may be coming to the view that expensive </p><p>fue </p><p></p></div>
