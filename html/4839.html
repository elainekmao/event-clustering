On December 22, EconChief and Econoff visited the offices </p><p>of Gulf and Middle East Technological Solutions (GMETS) to </p><p>verify that the company had received one chem/bio personal </p><p>protective kit (export license 05-870417), per reftel </p><p>instructions.  Econoffs met with the company\'s managing </p><p>director, John Middleton, who showed them the protective kit, </p><p>which he said arrived last week.  Middleton said he received </p><p>the product via Federal Express from two representatives of </p><p>US Cavalry Company, which sells the protective kits.  The </p><p>representatives sent him the product from the United Arab </p><p>Emirates, where they were on a training assignment. </p><p> </p><p>2. Middleton confirmed that the protective kit is being used </p><p>as a sample for evaluation by the Kuwaiti Ministry of </p><p>Interior (MOI) through its General Department of Civil </p><p>Defense.  Middleton said that he has been dealing directly </p><p>with officials at Civil Defense, a department within MOI, and </p><p>that he received the kit under an export license for sample </p><p>only.  He said that MOI granted his company approval to sell </p><p>the protective kits in Kuwait as the lone authorized importer </p><p>of the product.  Middleton added that he intends to obtain a </p><p>license to import additional protective kits for sale in </p><p>Kuwait, while the sample kit will be retained for personal </p><p>use by his company. </p><p> </p><p>3. GMETS appears to be a legitimate company with a range of </p><p>business activities in Kuwait and the region.  Middleton said </p><p>the company has active contracts with the GOK, the Government </p><p>of Bahrain, and a number of defense contractors.  Middleton </p><p>is also the Managing Director of International Vehicle and </p><p>Cargo Inspection Systems Company (IVACIS), which is pursuing </p><p>a contract to distribute large-scale electrical generators to </p><p>the US Military at Camp Doha.  Middleton said his company </p><p>previously sold "clamshell" shelters to the US Military </p><p>during Desert Storm. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
