(C) SUMMARY: ON JANUARY 31, THE PARLIAMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE PASSED THE DECEPTIVELY-NAMED ACCESS TO </p><p>INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY ACT AFTER THREE </p><p>WEEKS OF DEBATE.  THE ACT, WHICH HAS YET TO BE SIGNED BY </p><p>THE PRESIDENT AND GAZETTED INTO LAW, ESSENTIALLY PLACES </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS AND MEDIA COMPANIES </p><p>UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTROL AND RESTRICTS THE OPERATION OF </p><p>FOREIGN JOURNALISTS AND MEDIA IN ZIMBABWE.  AFTER THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL COMMITTEE (PLC) ISSUED AN ADVERSE </p><p>REPORT ON THE BILL, ABOUT HALF OF THE ORIGINAL BILL\'S </p><p>CLAUSES WERE AMENDED IN BEHIND-THE-SCENES WRANGLING </p><p>BETWEEN JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA AND PLC </p><p>CHAIRMAN EDDISON ZVOBGO.  MEDIA WATCHER ORGANIZATIONS </p><p>CALLED THE CHANGES "INSIGNIFICANT" AND SAID THE FINAL </p><p>VERSION OF THE ACT IS STILL REPRESSIVE.  PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE MAY DELAY IMPLEMENTING THE ACT TO AVOID FURTHER </p><p>RECRIMINATIONS FROM WESTERN COUNTRIES PLANNING TO SEND </p><p>ELECTION OBSERVERS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>CONTENTIOUS DEBATE ON CONTROVERSIAL BILL </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ON JANUARY 31, THE PARLIAMENT OF ZIMBABWE PASSED </p><p>THE DISINGENUOUSLY-NAMED ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND </p><p>PROTECTION OF PRIVACY ACT AFTER THREE WEEKS OF DEBATE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00345  01 OF 04  071444Z </p><p>AND UNEXPECTED DELAY.  MOST OF THE CONTENTION IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT OCCURRED NOT BETWEEN THE RULING ZANU-PF AND </p><p>MDC, BUT BETWEEN MEMBERS OF ZANU-PF.  THE TROUBLE BEGAN </p><p>WHEN ZANU-PF MP AND CHAIRMAN OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LEGAL </p><p>COMMITTEE (PLC) EDDISON ZVOBGO FOUND THE INFORMATION </p><p>BILL UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ISSUED AN ADVERSE REPORT ON IT </p><p>IN EARLY JANUARY.  ZANU-PF LIKELY INTENDED TO IGNORE THE </p><p>REPORT, AS IT HAS DONE WITH OTHER UNFAVORABLE ONES, AND </p><p>RUSH THE BILL THROUGH.  HOWEVER, WHEN ZVOBGO REPEATEDLY </p><p>REFUSED TO APPEAR IN PARLIAMENT TO PRESENT THE REPORT, A </p><p>REQUIREMENT FOR THE BILL TO PROCEED, ZANU-PF FOUND </p><p>ITSELF STUCK.  JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK CHINAMASA (AND </p><p>LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY) APPROACHED ZVOBGO ON </p><p>WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET THE BILL THROUGH.  THIS </p><p>RESULTED IN NEARLY TWO WEEKS OF BEHIND-THE-SCENES </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN CHINAMASA AND THE PLC.  INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO, AUTHOR OF THE BILL AND MUCH </p><p>DESPISED IN HIS OWN PARTY, WAS VISIBLY EMBARRASSED.  ON </p><p>THE NIGHT OF THE BILL\'S PASSAGE, CHINAMASA REPORTEDLY </p><p>REBUFFED MOYO ON THE HOUSE FLOOR, MUCH TO THE AMUSEMENT </p><p>OF THE MDC MEMBERS.  THE BILL FINALLY RECEIVED THE PLC\'S </p><p>ASSENT WITH 50 OUT OF 103 CLAUSES AMENDED OR DELETED; </p><p>THE MDC DID NOT CONTEST ITS PASSAGE. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>AMENDMENTS ARE MOSTLY MINOR </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) MOST OF THE AMENDMENTS WRITTEN INTO THE ACT BY </p><p>THE PLC ARE RELATIVELY MINOR OR COSMETIC.  ONE OF THE </p><p>MORE SIGNIFICANT IS A PROVISION FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00345  01 OF 04  071444Z </p><p>JOURNALISTS AND MEDIA HOUSES TO NOMINATE AT LEAST THREE </p><p>MEMBERS TO THE MEDIA AND INFORMATION COMMISSION THAT </p><p>WILL BE REGULATE JOURNALISTS AND MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p>PREVIOUSLY, THE INFORMATION MINISTER WOULD HAVE </p><p>APPOINTED ALL FIVE TO SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION. </p><p>SOME OF THE OTHER CHANGES: </p><p> </p><p>-- FOREIGN INVESTORS WILL BE PERMITTED TO OWN MINORITY </p><p>SHARES OF ZIMBABWEAN MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS RATHER THAN </p><p>BEING BANNED ALTOGETHER.  HOWEVER, THIS CLAUSE IS NOT </p><p>RETROACTIVE, AND OWNERSHIP OF MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS AS OF </p><p>JANUARY 31, 2002 WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO CHANGE. </p><p> </p><p>-- ALL JOURNALISTS WITH PRESS CREDENTIALS BEFORE THE ACT </p><p>IS GAZETTED WILL BE DEEMED REGISTERED WITH THE </p><p>COMMISSION UNTIL THE END OF 2002 INSTEAD OF BEING </p><p>REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF THE ACT\'S </p><p>GAZETTING. </p><p> </p><p>-- DISPUTES OVER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE BILL WILL BE </p><p>REFERRED TO THE COURTS RATHER THAN THE INFORMATION </p><p>MINISTER. </p><p> </p><p>-- FOREIGN JOURNALISTS MAY APPLY TO WORK IN ZIMBABWE FOR </p><p>"A LIMITED PERIOD" RATHER THAN "A FEW DAYS." </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ7054 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00345  02 OF 04  071444Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  AS-01    CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  WHA-00   SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      OIGO-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /011W </p><p>                  ------------------6380E0  071445Z /38 </p><p>P 071427Z FEB 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0897 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>AMEMBASSY KINGSTON </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 04 HARARE 000345 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR CHARLES NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR TERRY PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/07/12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT PLACES </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00345  02 OF 04  071444Z </p><p>INDEPENDENT PRESS UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTROL </p><p> </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN JOURNALISTS MAY NOW REPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>MEDIA, IN ADDITION TO THEIR ZIMBABWEAN MEDIA EMPLOYER, </p><p>PROVIDED THEY HAVE THE PERMISSION OF THE EMPLOYER. </p><p> </p><p>-- MAXIMUM FINES FOR MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS IN VIOLATION OF </p><p>THE ACT WERE REDUCED FROM $Z 1 MILLION (US$3,300) TO </p><p>Z$300,000 (US$1,000). </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>ACT PLACES NUMEROUS GOVERNMENT CONTROLS ON MEDIA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>4.
