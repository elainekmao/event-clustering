<p>UNCLAS OTTAWA 001304 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR IO/T (BLACKWOOD), WHA/CAN (RUNNING) </p><p> </p><p>HHS FOR OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, OFFICE OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS (STEIGER) </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR HOHMAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: AORC, PREL, CA, WHO, Health </p><p>SUBJECT: Framework Convention on Tobacco Control </p><p>(FCTC): Canadian response to demarche </p><p> </p><p>Ref. SECSTATE 106632 </p><p> </p><p>1. Health Canada\'s response concerning reftel demarche </p><p>was unequivocal: Canada will not support deletion of </p><p>FCTC Article 30 at the upcoming World Health Assembly </p><p>(WHA).  In Canada\'s view, the text of the Convention is </p><p>now in its final form and it is too late in the process </p><p>to revisit the text and remove the reservations clause. </p><p>End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  Health Canada\'s Director General of International </p><p>Affairs, Ed Aiston, delivered an unequivocal message to </p><p>ESTH Counselor and ESTH Specialist on the question of </p><p>Canadian support for our proposal to delete article 30 </p><p>of the FCTC.  The Canadian position is: The text of the </p><p>Convention is now final; Canada will not support </p><p>opening of the text and deletion of Article 30. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Aiston remarked that delegates at the WHA are </p><p>generally not those officials who negotiated the FCTC. </p><p>As a consequence, opening the text and managing the </p><p>consequences in this different milieu, is of concern to </p><p>Canada.  Aiston noted in particular that the text </p><p>contains a number of fragile compromises that Canada </p><p>would not want to have reexamined and possibly </p><p>subjected to change at the WHA.  Aiston also pointed </p><p>out that Canada has concerns that removal of the </p><p>reservations clause could allow some countries to </p><p>dilute the impact of the FCTC.  (Aiston made clear to </p><p>us that he would not put the United States in that </p><p>group.)  Finally, the draft final text has already been </p><p>submitted to the relevant ministers for their review. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The prior delivery of the demarche to officials at </p><p>the Department of Foreign Affairs and International </p><p>Trade (DFAIT) yielded a polite audience.  They </p><p>indicated that generally the GoC was flexible on the </p><p>issue of reservations.  But they made it clear that </p><p>Health Canada is where the decision resides on the </p><p>FCTC.  Ross Snyder, Deputy Director of UN Specialized </p><p>Agencies Division, and Shelley Whiting, Deputy Director </p><p>of the United Nations, Human Rights and Economic Law </p><p>Division, received our demarche, but noted that they </p><p>believe that the current draft final text contains </p><p>references to constitutional limits in Article 13 that </p><p>address USG concerns about infringement of </p><p>Constitutionally-guaranteed rights.  They also noted </p><p>their worry that our effort to revisit Article 30 could </p><p>embolden Germany to once again raise its concerns with </p><p>the advertising proscriptions of the FCTC. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Comment: Although Aiston delivered an unwelcome </p><p>message from the GoC, he prefaced it with remarks that </p><p>one of Canada\'s objectives had been to see the United </p><p>States sign and ratify the FCTC.  Canada, he noted, had </p><p>worked hard in the negotiations as a good faith partner </p><p>and had made compromises to achieve results amenable to </p><p>American participation.  Indeed, Aiston added, Canada </p><p>had made its best efforts during the negotiations phase </p><p>to get rid of the reservations clause.  That effort </p><p>was, however, unsuccessful and Canada considers it is </p><p>now too late to revisit the issue.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
