THEY HAD BEEN IN DETENTION SINCE 1998. </p><p>SPECULATION IS THAT CUBA DECIDED TO TRY THE THREE IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF THE 9/11 ATTACKS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW CUBA HAS ALSO </p><p>BEEN A VICTIM OF TERRORISM. </p><p> </p><p>D) IN 2001, THE GOC DID NOT REQUEST THE EXTRADITION TO CUBA </p><p>OF ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS, NOR THE USG REQUESTED THE </p><p>EXTRADITION OF ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FROM CUBA FOR </p><p>PROSECUTION IN THE U.S.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE U.S.-CUBA </p><p>EXTRADITION TREATY WAS SUSPENDED FOLLOWING THE BREAK IN </p><p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS IN 1961.
