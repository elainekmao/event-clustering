TRAN DUC LUONG, PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF </p><p>VIETNAM </p><p>MR. PHAN VAN KHAI, PRIME MINISTER OF THE SOCIALIST </p><p>REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM </p><p>MR. NONG DUC MANH, CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF </p><p>THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM </p><p> </p><p>DEAR SIRS: </p><p> </p><p>FOR GENERATIONS, THE CONCEPT OF FILIAL PIETY - CHILDREN\'S </p><p>AFFECTION, LOVE, RESPECT, AND CARE FOR THEIR PARENTS - HAS </p><p>BEEN THE WAY OF LIFE OF OUR SOCIETY.  EVEN AFTER REACHING </p><p>ADULTHOOD, VIETNAMESE PEOPLE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SERVE AND TAKE </p><p>CARE OF THEIR ELDER PARENTS. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00631  01 OF 02  250206Z </p><p>I DARE SAY THAT EVEN YOU WOULD NOT ABANDON THIS </p><p>TRADITIONAL PRACTICE, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR ELDER PARENTS </p><p>WERE IN A POOR STATE OF HEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>MY PURPOSE HERE IS NOT TO PRY INTO YOUR PERSONAL FAMILY </p><p>AFFAIRS, BUT TO DEMONSTRATE IN A PERSONAL MANNER THE </p><p>GRIEVOUS ANXIETY THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF BUDDHIST </p><p>BELIEVERS FEEL ABOUT THEIR SPIRITUAL LEADER, THE MOST </p><p>VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG, THE PATRIARCH OF THE UNIFIED </p><p>BUDDHIST CHURCH OF VIETNAM (UBCV). </p><p> </p><p>THE MOST VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG, BIRTH NAME LE DINH </p><p>NHAN, 83, WAS ARRESTED AND PUT UNDER DETENTION BY THE HO </p><p>CHI MINH CITY POLICE IN 1982 IN AN ABANDONED PAGODA IN </p><p>NGHIA HANH DISTRICT, QUANG NGAI PROVINCE.  HE HAS BEEN </p><p>DETAINED THERE FOR 19 YEARS, BUT HAS NEVER BEEN CHARGED </p><p>WITH A CRIME.  BESIDES OLD AGE AND WEAKNESS, THE MOST </p><p>VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG SUFFERS MANY SERIOUS </p><p>ILLNESSES.  ONE PERSON COMES TO COOK FOR HIM IN THE </p><p>MORNING, BUT LEAVES IN THE AFTERNOON.  IN THE EVENING, NO </p><p>ONE IS THERE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.  OVER THE PAST 19 YEARS, </p><p>THE POLICE HAVE HARASSED HIM HUNDREDS OF TIMES.  THIS HAS </p><p>MADE HIM EXCLAIM, "I HAVE NO HOME TO LIVE IN, NO GRAVE TO </p><p>DIE IN, NO ROAD TO WALK UPON, AND NO CRIME TO JUSTIFY THIS </p><p>INTERMINABLE IMPRISONMENT." </p><p> </p><p>ON NOVEMBER 28, 1997, THE POLICE OF QUANG NGAI PROVINCE </p><p>CAME TO HIM AND READ OUT A STATE DECISION DECLARING THAT </p><p>HIS TERM OF DETENTION WAS OFFICIALLY CONCLUDED.  THEY READ </p><p>IT TO HIM, BUT WOULD NOT HAND THE DOCUMENT OVER TO HIM AS </p><p>REQUIRED BY LAW.  IN DECEMBER OF THAT YEAR, THE POLICE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00631  01 OF 02  250206Z </p><p>CAME BACK TO FORCE HIM TO REGISTER AND HAVE HIS </p><p>IDENTIFICATION CARD SHOW HIS OFFICIAL RESIDENCE AS CHO </p><p>CHUA COMMUNE, NGHIA HANH DISTRICT, QUANG NGAI PROVINCE. </p><p>BUT HE REFUSED TO SIGN THE DOCUMENTS.  HE STATED THAT </p><p>BECAUSE HE WAS ARRESTED IN SAIGON, WHEN HIS TERM OF </p><p>DETENTION IS CONCLUDED, HE SHOULD BE PROVIDED AN OFFICIAL </p><p>RELEASE ORDER TO ALLOW HIM TO RETURN TO HIS PREVIOUS </p><p>RESIDENCE AT AN QUANG PAGODA.  THE POLICE OFFICER LEFT </p><p>WITHOUT RESPONDING TO THIS STATEMENT, AND THE AUTHORITIES </p><p>OF QUANG NGAI HAVE YET TO FREE THE PATRIARCH. </p><p> </p><p>UNDER THE GOVERNMENT DECREE ON HOUSEHOLD REGISTRATION AND </p><p>MANAGEMENT NUMBERED 51/CP, DATED MAY 10, 1997, HO CHI MINH </p><p>CITY RESIDENTS WHO ARE SENT TO PRISON OR WHO SUBMIT TO </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE PUNISHMENTS AT REEDUCATION CAMPS OR MEDICAL </p><p>TREATMENT CENTERS ARE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO AND RESIDE IN </p><p>HO CHI MINH CITY ONCE THEIR TERM OF DETENTION HAS </p><p>CONCLUDED.  WE ASK WHY THE POLICE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES OF </p><p>QUANG NGAI HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THIS DECREE, WHICH IS CLEAR </p><p>AND SPECIFIC. </p><p> </p><p>CURRENTLY, THE MOST VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG\'S HEALTH </p><p>IS DETERIORATING.  OUR ENTIRE CHURCH AND ITS BUDDHIST </p><p>BELIEVERS ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED.  THIS IS WHY I AM </p><p>WRITING TO REQUEST YOUR URGENT ACTION.  I RESPECTFULLY </p><p>REQUEST YOU TO ISSUE A LETTER TO THE PROVINCE OF QUANG </p><p>NGAI SO THAT THE MOST VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG MAY BE </p><p>FREED TO RETURN TO HIS PERMANENT RESIDENCE IN HO CHI MINH </p><p>CITY AS REGULATED BY DECREE 51/CP. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00631  02 OF 02  250206Z </p><p> </p><p>IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE A REPLY OR IF YOU DO NOT ISSUE ANY </p><p>LETTER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE REQUEST OF OUR CHURCH BY EARLY </p><p>JUNE, I WILL HEAD A DELEGATION OF MONKS, NUNS AND </p><p>BELIEVERS TO QUANG NGAI TO ESCORT THE MOST VENERABLE THICH </p><p>HUYEN QUANG BACK TO SAIGON.  HIS HEALTH CONDITION NOW IS </p><p>SUCH THAT HE NEEDS REGULAR CARE AND TREATMENT BY NURSES </p><p>AND ATTENDANTS ON A DAILY BASIS. </p><p> </p><p>THE EXILE TO A REMOTE, MOUNTAINOUS AREA OF AN ORDINARY, </p><p>GOOD MAN SPARKS ANGER IN HUMANITY.  THE EXILE OF THE </p><p>PATRIARCH WHO REPRESENTS MILLIONS OF BUDDHIST BELIEVERS IS </p><p>EVEN MORE OF AN AFFRONT TO MANKIND. </p><p> </p><p>IF THE MOST VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG PASSES AWAY, I </p><p>SINCERELY WOULD NOT WANT THE PARTY AND THE STATE TO BE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE TO HISTORY AND TO THE CONSCIENCES OF TENS OF </p><p>MILLIONS OF VIETNAMESE BUDDHIST BELIEVERS. </p><p> </p><p>THAT IS THE REASON I WRITE THIS URGENT, HUMANE REQUEST. </p><p> </p><p>RESPECTFULLY YOURS, </p><p> </p><p>BUDDHIST MONK THICH QUANG DO </p><p>HEAD OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE </p><p> </p><p>CC: THE MOST VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG </p><p>OFFICE II OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE </p><p>UBCV AT ALL LEVELS DOMESTIC AND ABROAD </p><p>HEAD OF AN QUANG PAGODA </p><p>INTERNATIONAL BUDDHIST INFORMATION BUREAU IN PARIS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00631  02 OF 02  250206Z </p><p> </p><p>END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>RAY </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
