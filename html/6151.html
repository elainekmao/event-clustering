<p>UNCLAS ROME 000923 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, OPRC, PGOV, IZ, IT, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALIAN RIGHTS GROUP PUBLICIZES NEW EVIDENCE OF </p><p>IRAQI BRUTALITY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. SUMMARY:  A PROMINENT ITALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION </p><p>PUBLISHED FEBRUARY 28 A NEW REPORT ON VIOLENCE COMMITTED </p><p>AGAINST POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND PRISONERS BY SADDAM HUSSEIN </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  00923  061433Z </p><p>AND HIS REGIME. ITALIAN MEDIA PUBLISHED EXCERPTS, PROVIDING </p><p>ITALIANS SOME UNCOMFORTABLE (BUT TIMELY) REMINDERS OF THE </p><p>LIKELY CONSEQUENCES OF SADDAM\'S CONTINUATION IN POWER.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. ON FEBRUARY 28, "HANDS OFF CAIN" (NESSUNO TOCCHI CAINO), </p><p>A HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH THE SMALL, INDEPENDENT </p><p>RADICAL PARTY, PRESENTED TO THE PRESS A NEW REPORT, "THE </p><p>DEATH PENALTY AND MORE UNDER SADDAM HUSSEIN." (FULL TEXT </p><p>AVAILABLE AT WWW.HANDSOFFCAIN.ORG)  THE ORGANIZATION\'S </p><p>GENERAL SECRETARY, SERGIO D\'ELIA, SAID THE GROUP WAS </p><p>PUBLISHING THE REPORT IN ADVANCE OF ITS ANNUAL GLOBAL SURVEY </p><p>OF THE DEATH PENALTY BECAUSE "AWARENESS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>SITUATION - IN PARTICULAR THE WIDESPREAD USE OF THE DEATH </p><p>PENALTY - IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO CONSIDER IN THE CURRENT </p><p>DEBATE ON THE IRAQ CRISIS." THOUGH IT FAVORS COMPLETE </p><p>ABOLITION OF THE DEATH PENALTY, THE GROUP GENERALLY PROVIDES </p><p>A SOPHISTICATED, NUANCED ANALYSIS OF ITS USE IN THE U.S. </p><p> </p><p>3. THE TEXT CONTAINS A COLLECTION OF EPISODES ALREADY </p><p>GATHERED IN THE REPORTS ISSUED LAST YEAR BY THE BRITISH </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND BY THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND NEW </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES OF VIOLENCE INFLICTED ON IRAQIS. THE CASES </p><p>PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITALY REGARD A LONG LIST OF </p><p>EXECUTIONS OF PRESUMPTIVE POLITICAL OPPONENTS AS WELL AS </p><p>MORE THAN TWENTY ARMY AND AIR FORCE OFFICERS CONDEMNED FOR </p><p>TREASON, MONITORED BY ARAB MEDIA AND BBC INTERNATIONAL. </p><p>HANDS OFF CAIN COUNTED 214 EXECUTIONS IN 2002 THROUGH </p><p>REPORTS BY VARIOUS IRAQI MEDIA AND OPPOSITION SOURCES. IN </p><p>2001, THE TOTAL WAS 179. THESE TOTALS DO NOT TAKE INTO </p><p>ACCOUNT UNCONFIRMED MASS EXECUTIONS REPORTED BY DISSIDENTS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00923  061433Z </p><p> </p><p>4. THE REPORT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS NEW DEATH PENALTY  PROVISIONS </p><p>ADDED IN THE MILITARY CRIMINAL CODE RELATED TO AIR DEFENSE </p><p>FORCE AND DISCLOSED BY THE IRAQI COMMUNIST PARTY. CAPITAL </p><p>PUNISHMENT COULD BE INFLICTED NOT ONLY FOR DAMAGING WEAPONS </p><p>AND MILITARY EQUIPMENT BUT ALSO FOR "REVEALING SECRETS AND </p><p>INFORMATION ON CASUALTIES TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE THEIR UNIT AND </p><p>THE SPREADING OF RUMORS WITHIN THEIR UNIT." THE VAGUENESS OF </p><p>THE REGULATIONS COULD LEAD TO OTHER ABUSES, HANDS OFF CAIN </p><p>EMPHASIZED. </p><p> </p><p>5. AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE MFA UNDERSECRETARY MARGHERITA </p><p>BONIVER STATED THAT THE GOI WAS WILLING TO PLAY AN ACTIVE </p><p>ROLE IN ORDER TO STOP THE MASSACRE OF MANY INNOCENTS. </p><p>SEVERAL NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS AND TELEVISION NEWS COVERED THE </p><p>EVENT WITH ARTICLES AND INTERVIEWS.  HAND OFF CAIN IS ONE OF </p><p>ITALY\'S MOST ACTIVE HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCACY GROUPS; IT HAS </p><p>PROMOTED INITIATIVES AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY AND IN FAVOR </p><p>OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.  IT WAS CREATED IN 1993 </p><p>BY A GROUP OF ACTIVISTS OF THE RADICAL PARTY, A SMALL, </p><p>INDEPENDENT, CLASSICALLY LIBERAL PARTY FOUNDED BY MARCO </p><p>PANNELLA.  THE RADICAL PARTY IS GENERALLY OPEN AND PRO- </p><p>AMERICAN IN ITS OUTLOOK. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENT:  WHILE THE GROUP\'S REPORT IS UNLIKELY TO CAUSE </p><p>A SEA CHANGE IN ITALIAN PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT MILITARY </p><p>ACTION, IT IS A TIMELY REMINDER, NONETHELESS, OF THE </p><p>PROBLEMS INSIDE IRAQ ABOVE AND BEYOND THOSE OF WEAPONS OF </p><p>MASS DESTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00923  061433Z </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2003ROME00923 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
