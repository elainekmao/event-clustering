<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000283 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KDEM, PGOV, PREL, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MEETING ON DEPLOYMENT OF ELECTION </p><p>MONITORS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY: The Embassy convened a meeting with U.S. </p><p>NGOs and others on January 30 to discuss numbers and </p><p>deployments of election monitors for Nigeria\'s April </p><p>national elections.  Given the size of Nigeria and the </p><p>number of polling stations, the international monitor </p><p>presence will be relatively small, but nevertheless </p><p>difficult to coordinate.  There are serious deficiencies in </p><p>the current domestic monitoring framework; the Mission is </p><p>trying to address them.  Additional training resources may </p><p>be urgently required (see para 5).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) NDI/Carter Center expects 25-30 monitors for the </p><p>April 12 National Assembly elections (possibly led by </p><p>former Secretary Albright) and an additional 30 (for a </p><p>minimum total of 50) for the April 19 presidential election </p><p>(possibly led by FPOTUS Carter and former Namibian Prime </p><p>Minister Hage Geingob).  IRI expects 50 monitors (10 will </p><p>be here for National Assembly elections), split into 15 </p><p>field teams of three and an Abuja-based headquarters </p><p>component.  The BHC, speaking on behalf of the EU and the </p><p>Commonwealth, expects 106 monitors from the EU for both </p><p>elections and 15-25 from the Commonwealth.  The BHC </p><p>representative understood that the Japanese might also send </p><p>monitors.  It is probable that there will be other </p><p>monitoring groups, perhaps from the AU, ECOWAS and SADC. </p><p>The likely minimum number of international monitors is 215, </p><p>and the maximum is not likely to exceed 250.  A UNEAD </p><p>official commented repeatedly that each group should engage </p><p>in an "internal dialogue" before there could be an inter- </p><p>group discussion of coordinating deployments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The Independent National Electoral Commission is </p><p>hosting a meeting February 14 for international monitors to </p><p>discuss accreditation and expectations.  An INEC meeting </p><p>for domestic groups interested in monitoring was postponed </p><p>from February 4 to the week of February 10 (two days during </p><p>that week are likely to be Nigerian national holidays). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The presence of international monitors will be </p><p>important but the amount of coverage they will provide will </p><p>be limited.  With some 120,000 polling places, </p><p>comprehensive international monitoring could never be a </p><p>realistic prospect.  Unfortunately, each of the various </p><p>monitoring groups appears inclined to attempt "national" </p><p>coverage with their respective 25-100 monitors.  Among </p><p>them, however, only NDI had a basic concept in place.  The </p><p>danger is that each group might visit the same states, or </p><p>even the same Local Government Areas.  A second meeting </p><p>will be held the week of February 18, and the groups have </p><p>been invited to produce a document similar to NDI\'s, as </p><p>well as a summary explanation for their proposed </p><p>deployments.  The assembled groups will then attempt to </p><p>work out specific places of deployment to minimize </p><p>redundancy and maximize spread of coverage.  (COMMENT: </p><p>Notwithstanding the UNEAD official\'s harping on the need </p><p>for each group to have an "internal dialogue" on deployment </p><p>before discussing coordination and his thought that </p><p>coordination might ultimately prove impossible.  We are </p><p>optimistic that a useful level of coordination can be </p><p>attained.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) All participants in the January 30 meeting agreed </p><p>that, even if international monitors coordinate well, a </p><p>heavy burden for assessing the conduct of the electoral </p><p>process would fall on the domestic monitors. </p><p>Unfortunately, the Transition Monitoring Group (TMG - whose </p><p>credibility was damaged by its inability to field the </p><p>promised number of monitors for the September 2002 </p><p>registration process) and the Justice Development and Peace </p><p>Committee (JDPC - affiliated with the Catholic Church), the </p><p>two major domestic monitoring groups, are barely talking </p><p>with each other.  Moreover, both groups draw their strength </p><p>from southern Nigeria and the peoples indigenous to the </p><p>South.  The Mission is trying to encourage groups with </p><p>Northern roots that might be able to deploy large numbers </p><p>of monitors to consider attending the INEC meeting for </p><p>domestic monitors.  We are making progress on this </p><p>objective, and may need additional training resources </p><p>urgently. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
