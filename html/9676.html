(SBU) Summary: Despite continued public awareness about </p><p>the likelihood of a major earthquake in the next 30 years, </p><p>Istanbul remains ill-prepared for a major natural disaster. </p><p>To the extent that municipal and state officials have begun </p><p>to focus on this critical issue, the bulk of their attention </p><p>has been on response efforts and not the more difficult </p><p>mitigation efforts.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Waiting for the Big One... </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>2. (U) Lying just off of the Northern Anatolian fault line, </p><p>Istanbul (and its prior incarnations as Constantinople and </p><p>Byzantium) has experienced major earthquakes every 100 to 150 </p><p>years during its long history.  The question is not whether </p><p>an earthquake will occur, but rather when and how damaging it </p><p>will be.  A sequential westward progression of major </p><p>earthquakes this century has led experts to believe that </p><p>there is now a 65 percent probability of a major earthquake </p><p>near Istanbul in the next 30 years.  What troubles these </p><p>experts and municipal authorities is the fact that modern </p><p>Istanbul has grown in population from under a million to </p><p>approximately 12 million in just two generations.  Most of </p><p>this vast expansion has taken place in the absence of </p><p>sensible land-use planning and earthquake-resistant </p><p>construction.  These same problems led to the tens of </p><p>thousands of deaths in the 1999 Kocaeli/Izmit earthquake, </p><p>whereas similar magnitude earthquakes in developed countries </p><p>with modern urban planning and construction cause relatively </p><p>less damage (49 deaths in San Francisco/Oakland in 1989). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Recent studies (including one funded by the American </p><p>Red Cross) indicate that a major earthquake (7.5 on the </p><p>Richter scale) in the immediate vicinity of Istanbul is </p><p>expected to claim 40-50,000 lives and cost USD 11-12 billion </p><p>in direct building damages (not including other property </p><p>damage, secondary losses in productivity, and a million or </p><p>more homeless).  Severe shaking during the 1999 Izmit quake </p><p>claimed almost a thousand lives and damaged over 23,000 </p><p>buildings in the Istanbul neighborhood of Avcilar (over 80 km </p><p>from the epicenter but consisting mostly of unstable land) </p><p>and forced Istanbul residents to flee their houses and </p><p>prompted many to sleep in the streets for days.  Recent polls </p><p>suggest that the psychological damage has endured: 58 percent </p><p>of the city\'s residents are expecting a major earthquake, 29 </p><p>percent have moved (or plan to move) to "safer" </p><p>neighborhoods, and 40 percent say that only their work </p><p>prevents them from leaving the city altogether.  As recently </p><p>as July 9, rumors of an impending earthquake panicked </p><p>Istanbul residents until the Kandilli Observatory and </p><p>municipal authorities debunked the scare. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Challenges to Disaster Preparedness </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>4. (U) WHO\'S IN CHARGE?: The problems and challenges involved </p><p>in preparing for an earthquake are considerable.  They begin </p><p>with the question of authority.  Outdated laws from the 1950s </p><p>(when Turkey was predominantly rural) formally delegate </p><p>disaster response to the national government and to its </p><p>representatives around the country (i.e., state-appointed </p><p>governors).  The Civil Defense Directorate of the Ministry of </p><p>Interior employs 2000 people around the country, but their </p><p>mandate and training deal primarily with the Cold War threat </p><p>of nuclear attack, not disaster preparedness.  Although an </p><p>Emergency Management Agency was created several years ago, </p><p>its role vis-a-vis other disaster management agencies remains </p><p>undefined.  The scale of the problem in large urban areas, </p><p>moreover, is far beyond the capacity of local governors and </p><p>has been unable to attract sufficient resources from a </p><p>government preoccupied with an ongoing economic crisis.  In </p><p>the absence of a national response on this issue of critical </p><p>concern, the Istanbul municipal authorities have stepped into </p><p>the vacuum, working closely with the governor\'s office and </p><p>local organizations to coordinate unified earthquake </p><p>preparations.  But tension between municipal and state </p><p>authorities has created major problems, obstacles, and delays </p><p>in advancing the city\'s level of preparedness.  Schools, </p><p>hospitals, and cultural heritage fall directly under state, </p><p>not municipal, control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) RESPONSE VERSUS MITIGATION: Earthquake preparations </p><p>fall into two general categories: response and mitigation. </p><p>Major steps have already been taken with regard to upgrading </p><p>and reinforcing the city\'s ability to respond to an </p><p>earthquake (training rescue teams and firefighters, </p><p>pre-positioning supplies), but the much larger and more </p><p>expensive mitigation efforts have only just begun.  The </p><p>Istanbul Muncipality, Turkish Red Crescent (with American Red </p><p>Cross assistance), and others have upgraded their response </p><p>preparations.  Prof. Nuray Aydinoglu, head of the Kandilli </p><p>Observatory (Turkey\'s premier earthquake research institute) </p><p>told us that the response to the June 2003 Bingol earthquake </p><p>showed that the response situation had improved considerably </p><p>in the last five years, but added that mitigation efforts </p><p>were few and unorganized.  Nasuh Mahruki, Chairman of AKUT (a </p><p>search-and-rescue NGO that achieved national fame for their </p><p>work after the 1999 Izmit earthquake), sardonically confirmed </p><p>to us that the city and other organizations seem to have </p><p>focused on the "glamorous" response preparations at the </p><p>expense of the more important preventive mitigation efforts. </p><p>Another earthquake engineer living in Bursa noted a similar </p><p>tendency on the part of municipal authorities there.  Even </p><p>response preparedness has focused disproportionately on </p><p>"heavy" search and rescue (using machinery to save people in </p><p>collapsed buildings) instead of "light" search and rescue </p><p>(where neighbors and local communities pull victims from </p><p>rubble), which typically accounts for 80 percent of those </p><p>rescued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) BUILDING CODES, TESTING, INSURANCE: Ironically, Turkey </p><p>adopted modern building codes (judged to have up-to-date </p><p>seismic design provisions by the USGS) shortly before the </p><p>devastating Izmit earthquake.  The new code, the product of </p><p>five years of work by expert commissions, was prompted by the </p><p>1992 Erzincan earthquake and largely tracked advances in U.S. </p><p>codes.  Aydinoglu, who was also the primary author of the new </p><p>code, told us that he is primarily concerned with his failure </p><p>since the 1980s to get Turkey to strengthen the legislation </p><p>regarding testing and enforcement of building codes. </p><p>Currently, the professional qualification requirements for </p><p>those testing designs and examining buildings are extremely </p><p>low.  An independent earthquake engineer told us separately </p><p>that the software that is used by architects to design </p><p>earthquake-resistant buildings is outdated and that engineers </p><p>testing the designs on behalf of the authorities use the same </p><p>software.  Although earthquake insurance is mandatory, only </p><p>25 percent of buildings are believed to be insured and </p><p>insurance companies have yet to develop any expertise or </p><p>experience examining buildings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) UNCHECKED AND UNPLANNED GROWTH: Despite the persistent </p><p>problems in design, however, the biggest problems for </p><p>municipal authorities are caused by poor land-use planning </p><p>and inferior construction.  Both problems have been </p><p>exacerbated by the massive and largely uncontrolled waves of </p><p>rural-to-urban migration that have made Istanbul Europe\'s </p><p>largest city at approximately 12 million people.  Municipal </p><p>authorities have been unable to cope with the flood of </p><p>immigrants, many of whom began their new lives in Istanbul </p><p>building unlicensed squatter (gecekondu, literally "landed by </p><p>night") settlements, often in "forest" or "state" lands. </p><p>Although a series of property amnesties has legalized many of </p><p>these buildings and neighborhoods, between 60 to 65 percent </p><p>of Istanbul\'s 1 million or so buildings were built without </p><p>proper construction permits (i.e., not according to the </p><p>approved plan or without a permit altogether).  Government </p><p>plans for yet another property amnesty could spur another </p><p>wave of illegal construction and vastly complicate municipal </p><p>efforts to prepare for an earthquake (see septel) (Embassy </p><p>Comment: At the same time, these plans may be driven by solid </p><p>political reasons. End Comment). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) EARTHQUAKE VULNERABILITY: One of the major challenges </p><p>in Istanbul relates to the construction style and lack of </p><p>building expertise.  Due to the ready availability of </p><p>affordable wood, most residences in California are built on </p><p>wooden frames, making them more ductile and </p><p>earthquake-resistant (although they are also more susceptible </p><p>to fires).  Due to a scarcity of wood, most Turkish </p><p>residences are built on relatively more static reinforced </p><p>concrete frames.  Furthermore, a lack of knowledge and </p><p>expertise regarding the proper use of transverse bars, </p><p>correctly-mixed concrete, and techniques to minimize moisture </p><p>and corrosion have made many of these structures </p><p>fundamentally unsound.  These simple problems have greatly </p><p>increased Turkey\'s vulnerability to earthquake damage. </p><p>Statistics from the losses in past earthquakes indicate that </p><p>for every life lost in California, 10 are lost in similar </p><p>earthquakes in Japan, and 100 in Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) CROOKED CONTRACTORS AND DEATH-BY-"PANCAKE": Endemic </p><p>corruption on the part of both building contractors and </p><p>municipal authorities has given rise to thousands of </p><p>sub-standard buildings that could become literal "death </p><p>traps" in the event of a major earthquake.  According to one </p><p>expert, authorities simply are not sufficiently well trained </p><p>and paid to be able to resist corruption and properly enforce </p><p>building codes.  The most common pattern of residential </p><p>construction has been for self-financing contractors to </p><p>conclude deals with land owners for permission to build in </p><p>return for handing over a specified number of the future </p><p>building\'s apartments.  With municipal authorities already on </p><p>the take to overlook the illegal construction, the </p><p>contractors have little incentive to comply with costly </p><p>building codes.  Instead, they cut corners, using inferior </p><p>materials and adding on unstable floors, to increase their </p><p>overall profits.  It is these reinforced concrete, 4- to </p><p>10-story, static or non-ductile apartment buildings that are </p><p>at the greatest risk of damage or even "pancake"-style </p><p>collapse that has claimed the most lives in previous </p><p>earthquakes.  Studies predict that a major earthquake in </p><p>Istanbul could result in between 5,000 and 6,000 such </p><p>pancaked buildings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) PUBLIC FACILITIES: In the event of an earthquake, the </p><p>safety of schools, hospitals, and other government buildings </p><p>will be critical to minimizing damages and coordinating </p><p>assistance.  These facilities, too, have yet to be thoroughly </p><p>examined and reinforced.  One World Bank-funded study </p><p>examined 26 hospitals and determined that 86 percent of them </p><p>needed major repairs and reinforcements.  The former Director </p><p>of the Kandilli Observatory and the then-Minister of Health </p><p>got into a nasty public quarrel over the failure to follow </p><p>through on the needed repairs.  The Ministry of Education </p><p>inspected the local schools, evacuated a few of the most </p><p>unsafe, and is engaged in reinforcing many others.  An </p><p>official from a major teachers\' union told us, however, that </p><p>the examinations were cursory at best.  Some cultural </p><p>heritage sites and museums have also begun to prepare for an </p><p>earthquake, but there is very little public funding available </p><p>for this work.  The director of Topkapi Palace, for example, </p><p>has obtained corporate sponsorship and has implemented a </p><p>program, but the Hagia Sophia (which is expected to suffer </p><p>serious damage in a major earthquake) has yet to do more than </p><p>study the issue. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mitigation: Step By Small Step... </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>11. (U) Despite the challenges, in addition to the </p><p>considerable work and organization that has been done on </p><p>disaster response preparations, municipal authorities have </p><p>also taken early steps to launch more comprehensive </p><p>mitigation programs.  After overcoming obstacles and delays </p><p>imposed by state authorities, the city conducted a loss </p><p>estimation study and a geological survey with Japanese </p><p>assistance to identify the areas and neighborhoods in </p><p>Istanbul that are at greatest risk in an earthquake.  A </p><p>consortium of universities, including Bogazici, Istanbul </p><p>Technical, Yilidiz Technical, and Middle East Technical </p><p>Universities, is set to complete a major study of economic, </p><p>legal, technical, and sociological factors to determine the </p><p>outlines for a mitigation project that will put all of </p><p>Istanbul\'s buildings through a screening process to identify </p><p>those that are at highest risk.  Istanbul officials estimate </p><p>that the process will take about 10 years and cost as much as </p><p>USD 10 billion.  A pilot project is due to begin shortly in </p><p>the Zeytinburnu district of Istanbul.  Separately, a contract </p><p>has also been awarded for retrofitting Istanbul\'s bridges. </p><p>Perhaps the most encouraging steps with regard to mitigation </p><p>have been taken by individuals sensitized to the dangers by </p><p>recent earthquakes.  Although municipal authorities are still </p><p>powerless to strictly enforce land-use plans and building </p><p>codes, several earthquake experts have noted that individual </p><p>land-owners and contractors are much less likely now to build </p><p>in unsafe neighborhoods or to cut corners in construction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Much Left to Do.... </p><p>------------------- </p><p>12. (U) Although much of what remains to be done will take </p><p>time and resources, there is also much that can be done at </p><p>relatively low cost.  The American head of a 3-year old </p><p>USAID/OFDA disaster awareness project believes that one of </p><p>the key issues is to educate renters, property owners, and </p><p>builders on how to construct earthquake-safe buildings. </p><p>Simple measures and techniques that cost no more than 10 </p><p>percent of the construction cost could make new buildings </p><p>much safer.  Another potentially productive area of education </p><p>is non-structural mitigation efforts (properly fastening </p><p>shelves and objects within buildings).  Fifty percent of </p><p>earthquake injuries and 10 percent of deaths are attributable </p><p>to non-structural causes.  The USAID/OFDA project (with only </p><p>USD 530,000) has implemented a sustainable basic disaster </p><p>awareness program for teachers and students, but has been </p><p>unable to fully address these other critical education and </p><p>awareness problems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>13. (U) Because of the terrifying enormity of its scale and </p><p>cost, preparing for a major earthquake is the proverbial </p><p>elephant in the room that nobody in Istanbul really wants to </p><p>talk about.  While the city does seem to have finally </p><p>acknowledged its presence, the bulk of its early efforts have </p><p>focused on the relatively easier and more glamorous task of </p><p>response preparations instead of the more difficult and </p><p>costly mitigation efforts.  Bottom line: Istanbul remains </p><p>woefully unprepared for an earthquake.  Inshallah (God </p><p>Willing), there will be enough time to advance major </p><p>mitigation and educational efforts before the big one hits. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
