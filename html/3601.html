Prior to that, Midzi served as </p><p>ambassador to the U.S. from 1993 to 1999 and Ambassador to </p><p>Cuba from 1987 to 1993.

He was also a </p><p>member of the ZANU-PF Central Committee from 1984-89. </p><p> </p><p>Midzi began his studies at the University of Rhodesia in 1974 </p><p>but was subsequently arrested for participation in liberation </p><p>activities and spent 3 years in political detention.  Midzi </p><p>later returned to the University and received a degree in </p><p>sociology in 1979.  He was born on July 4, 1952.  He is </p><p>married (Alice) and has three children.  He is a member of </p><p>the Zezuru ethnic group*the same as Mugabe. </p><p> </p><p>Reuben Marumahoko, Deputy Minister:  Reuben Marumahoko was MP </p><p>for Hurungwe East before becoming Deputy Minister.  His seat </p><p>was one challenged and won by the MDC in the High Court but </p><p>no by-election has yet been held.    He is a businessman and </p><p>is married.  He is a ZANU-PF branch political commissar.  He </p><p>has an O level education and a diploma in business </p><p>management.  Marumahoko was born on April 4, 1948. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprise Development </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Sithembiso Nyoni is the Minister of this newly created </p><p>Ministry.  Mugabe elevated the former Informal Sector </p><p>department in the president,s office, which Nyoni headed, to </p><p>a full ministry in order to boost the informal sector with </p><p>facilities and financial support. </p><p> </p><p>Nyoni is from Bulawayo\'s Makokoba constituency and was born </p><p>on 20 September 1949.  She is married.  Prior to being </p><p>elected to Parliament in 1994, she was a teacher, development </p><p>consultant, and a lecturer.

Its focus is to resuscitate </p><p>closed mines and assist those facing operational </p><p>difficulties.  The Ministry will also ensure that small-scale </p><p>miners (gold panners) are organized, do not damage the </p><p>environment, and sell their product to the Reserve Bank and </p><p>not on the black market.  It will also explore marble, </p><p>granite, diamond, and platinum mining.  Chindori-Chininga\'s </p><p>wife, Linda, is an American citizen from Houston. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>Ministry of State for Special Affairs </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>John Landa Nkomo, an Ndebele, is the head of this newly </p><p>formed sub-ministry.  There is no indication of what his new </p><p>responsibilities will be but Brian Raftopoulos, one of </p><p>Zimbabwe,s most perceptive political analysts, thought the </p><p>assignment could be a prelude to the Vice Presidency.  It </p><p>could be a way to disengage him from day-to-day ministerial </p><p>responsibilities and give him a chance to acquire a broader </p><p>perspective in preparation for his new duties.  Nkomo was the </p><p>Minister of Home Affairs prior to this appointment.  He is </p><p>still the ZANU-PF National Chair.  John Nkomo was born on </p><p>August 22, 1934 and is married. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Ministry of State, Science and Technology Development </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p>Olivia Muchena is the Minister of this new office created to </p><p>help the government address the development of science and </p><p>technology.

She has spent a large part of her </p><p>career in education and working in the NGO world.  In the </p><p>past, she was considered a respected technocrat with </p><p>political savvy and a sensible proponent of indigenization </p><p>and economic liberalization, but we have had little recent </p><p>contact with her. </p><p> </p><p>Muchena participated in the liberation struggle both as a </p><p>student activist at the University of Rhodesia and as a </p><p>member and chairperson of ZANU branches in Edinburgh (UK) and </p><p>Rochester-Syracuse-Ithaca, New York. </p><p> </p><p>She received a Ph.D. in Agricultural Education (extension) </p><p>from Iowa State University in 1990, a M.S. in Extension and </p><p>Rural Development from Cornell in 1977, and a B.A. from </p><p>University College of Rhodesia in 1970.

He is currently in the middle of an ongoing </p><p>murder investigation involving his wife,s &alleged8 lover. </p><p> Some within law enforcement and the victim,s family feel </p><p>the investigation will be undermined because Mohadi is now in </p><p>charge of the police force.
