<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001407 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE PASS USAID/DCHA/OFDA </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p>MANILA FOR OFDA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, CASC, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: Press Release Shows Maoists Feeling Heat </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) In a July 18 press release, Prachanda, President </p><p>of Nepal\'s Maoist Central Committee, called for a </p><p>political solution to the present conflict in the form of </p><p>a new interim government and expressed the Maoists\' </p><p>willingness to be flexible.  Making what appears to be a </p><p>pitch to mainstream political parties, Prachanda </p><p>criticized Nepal\'s monarchy and its military, but stated </p><p>that a recent split in the ruling party was not part of a </p><p>"conspiracy" against democracy.  The statement is negative </p><p>on the national elections slated for later this year, but </p><p>leaves open the possibility of elections if the Maoists </p><p>decide the political environment has improved, i.e., if an </p><p>interim government is formed to oversee elections. </p><p>Notably, the statement makes no mention of the Maoists\' </p><p>demands for a republic and a constituent assembly. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Observers viewed the message as a rehash of past </p><p>Maoists statements, and only "a little bit new."  All </p><p>agreed that the ongoing mobilization of Nepal\'s military </p><p>and, more directly, recent efforts by India to crack down </p><p>on Maoists operating on its territory, had begun to put </p><p>the squeeze on the insurgents.  One local editor suggested </p><p>that Maoist leaders living in India expect to be taken </p><p>next. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The release is widely considered genuine, but one </p><p>observer commented that he would wait a few days--to see </p><p>if the Maoists publish a retraction--before passing </p><p>judgement on its authenticity. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Post\'s unofficial translation of the release </p><p>follows. </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) </p><p>Central Committee </p><p> </p><p>Press statement </p><p> </p><p>The string of events from the time of the Palace massacre </p><p>to the present have made clear the fact that the feudal </p><p>regressive elements, on the backing and directions of </p><p>foreign reactionaries, under a planned conspiracy, have </p><p>been attempting to unleash extreme tyranny against Nepal </p><p>and the Nepali people.  Taking advantage of the weaknesses </p><p>of the political parties that participated in the historic </p><p>1990 People\'s Movement, the feudal regressive elements one </p><p>after another have been attacking the people\'s civil and </p><p>political achievements.  Now it is becoming clearer and </p><p>clearer that the fictitious dissolution of the Parliament </p><p>and the announcement of the so-called mid-term elections, </p><p>when the country has been in a very difficult and adverse </p><p>situation, are nothing but the conspiracy\'s final moves. </p><p>The plan to hold elections on a mountain of corpses and in </p><p>pools of blood, not providing a positive political </p><p>solution for millions of Nepali people struggling for a </p><p>progressive transformation of Nepali society under the </p><p>flags of the Maoist movement, is in itself a wicked </p><p>conspiracy.  When all the political parties both in and </p><p>outside parliament, intellectual society, and all the </p><p>people, unite against the emergency and for talks and a </p><p>positive political solution, right at that point the </p><p>Parliament was dissolved in the middle of the night, as if </p><p>by a criminal.  This has amplified many times the </p><p>seriousness of the conspiracy.  We have, very seriously, </p><p>been making it clear that the feud between Girija Prasad </p><p>Koirala and Sher Bahadur Deuba are not the reason behind </p><p>this, but rather that the feudal palace and the Royal Army </p><p>headquarters have raised arms against the people. </p><p> </p><p>In this situation, to think that it will be fruitful to </p><p>take part in the so-called mid-term elections, instead of </p><p>raising the voices of all the political parties, </p><p>intellectual society and the people, in a united manner, </p><p>against the so-called emergency and for the creation of an </p><p>appropriate environment for a positive political solution </p><p>and proper elections, and against the feudal regressive </p><p>elements, will be nothing but something like putting </p><p>oneself in the nets of an extremely cruel hunter.  In our </p><p>view, if all the pro-people forces side with the nation </p><p>and the people in a united order, without being </p><p>destabilized by the intimidation and conspiracy of the </p><p>feudal regressive forces, and make just one step forward, </p><p>doors to solving all the problems of the country will </p><p>simultaneously open.  Opposition to the so-called </p><p>emergency, talks for the positive political solution, </p><p>dialogue, interim government, and the agreed-upon election </p><p>procedures can, under its leadership, be the minimum basis </p><p>for the resolution of the problems for now.  The fact that </p><p>we are ready to resolve the existing problems of the </p><p>country in a flexible manner in accordance with talks, </p><p>dialogue and consensus with all the political parties and </p><p>pro-people powers, was made clear by the letter that we </p><p>had sent to all the political parties, both in and outside </p><p>parliament, and intellectuals before the so-called </p><p>emergency reached the six-month point.  We are still firm </p><p>today on those kind of initiatives as well as a political </p><p>solution. </p><p> </p><p>But if someone seeks security in the web of the feudal </p><p>regressive elements, they betray the country and the </p><p>people at this difficult and sensitive historical moment, </p><p>and the result of that will be decided by history.  We </p><p>don\'t consider entangling [oneself] in the web and thereby </p><p>staining history anything other than a highly despicable </p><p>act.  Therefore, we in total seriousness strongly appeal </p><p>to all the pro-people forces in the country to unite </p><p>against the so-called emergency and for a positive </p><p>political solution. </p><p> </p><p>Shrawan 2, 2059 (July 18, 2002) </p><p> </p><p>Prachanda, President, Central Committee, NCP (Maoist) </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
