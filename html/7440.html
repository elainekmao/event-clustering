<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000739 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S </p><p>USTR PASS PCOLEMAN, WJACKSON </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Zimbabwe\'s Lack of Progress Toward AGOA </p><p>Qualifications </p><p> </p><p>Ref: State 53658 </p><p> </p><p>Zimbabwe remains unqualified for AGOA.  We address the 6 </p><p>broad areas from reftel below: </p><p> </p><p>1) AGOA Trade and Investment:  N/A  Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>sophisticated textile sector is clearly losing business </p><p>to AGOA-qualified countries. </p><p> </p><p>2) Market Economy/Economic Reform/Elimination of Trade </p><p>Barriers: Zimbabwe\'s economic decline accelerated in </p><p>2002.  Gross Domestic Product lost about 12 percent.  The </p><p>Government\'s land redistribution demolished Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>agricultural sector, which traditionally accounted for </p><p>half of exports.  The country\'s infrastructure is </p><p>collapsing, with basic commodities increasing </p><p>unavailable.  Foreign direct investment is nearly zero. </p><p> </p><p>3) Rule of Law/Political Pluralism/Anti-Corruption: In </p><p>the aftermath of the deeply flawed March 2002 </p><p>presidential election, which most serious observer groups </p><p>dismissed as unfree and unfair, Government intensified </p><p>its repression of the opposition, the judiciary, and the </p><p>independent press.  President Mugabe regularly disparaged </p><p>the principal opposition party -- which, by the </p><p>Government\'s count, won 1.2 million of the 2.8 million </p><p>votes cast in the presidential election -- as a puppet of </p><p>the United Kingdom which should be crushed.  Corruption </p><p>at all levels of government appears to be increasing -- </p><p>exacerbated by the economy\'s implosion.  A government- </p><p>sanctioned audit of the chaotic land redistribution </p><p>program - the centerpiece of the ruling party\'s political </p><p>agenda -- revealed widespread abuse of the announced </p><p>resettlement rules by ruling party cronies, who benefited </p><p>handsomely from a policy bearing large responsibility for </p><p>Zimbabwe\'s rapid economic contraction. </p><p> </p><p>4) Poverty Reduction: Poverty expanded rapidly. </p><p>Zimbabweans have had increasingly difficulty affording </p><p>food, health-care and transport.  In 2002, the U.S. </p><p>contributed over US$ 120 million in food aid. </p><p> </p><p>5) Human Rights/Labor/Child Labor:  Zimbabwe\'s human </p><p>rights record continued to worsen, as an increasingly </p><p>unpopular government escalated its repression of </p><p>suspected opposition supporters.  In 2002, there were </p><p>1397 reported cases of torture, unlawful arrest, murder, </p><p>rape, and other politically-motivated crimes.  More than </p><p>90 percent of these attacks were perpetrated by ruling </p><p>party supporters and security services, according to </p><p>reputable human rights organizations.  The Government </p><p>frequently singled out labor leaders for intimidation. </p><p> </p><p>6) AGOA Outreach: N/A </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
