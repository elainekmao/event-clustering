IN AN APRIL 12 MEETING, CROATIA\'S CARDINAL KUHARIC </p><p>APPEALED TO THE AMBASSADOR FOR HELP FOR PERSECUTED </p><p>MINORITIES IN THE BANJA LUKA REGION.  DISCUSSING THE </p><p>SITUATION IN CROATIA, THE CARDINAL ADVOCATED "EQUALITY" </p><p>FOR THE SERBIAN POPULATION BUT WAS UNABLE TO COMPREHEND </p><p>WHY SERBS MIGHT NOT ALWAYS FEEL THEY ARE TREATED "EQUALLY" </p><p>IN CROATIA.  BIO NOTE:  KUHARIC TURNED 75 ON APRIL 15, </p><p>1995 AND, ACCORDING TO CANON LAW, SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO </p><p>AUTOMATIC RETIREMENT.  HOWEVER, IT APPEARS THAT THE POPE </p><p>WANTS HIM TO STAY ON, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING.  THERE </p><p>ARE NO CLEAR FAVORITES TO SUCCEED HIM.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p>LAST CHANCE TO HALT ETHNIC CLEANSING IN NORTHERN BOSNIA </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  ON APRIL 12 THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH FRANJO CARDINAL </p><p>KUHARIC WHO MADE AN APPEAL ON BEHALF OF THE LONG-SUFFERING </p><p>MINORITIES IN BANJA LUKA, NOW UNDER EVEN GREATER PRESSURE </p><p>AS A RESULT OF CROATIA HAVING RETAKEN SECTOR WEST AND </p><p>OTHER MILITARY REVERSES SUFFERED BY THE SERBS.  THE </p><p>CARDINAL ESTIMATED THAT IN THE NORTHERN BOSNIA AREA THERE </p><p>ONLY REMAIN 30,000 MUSLIMS AND 20,000 CROATS "SLEEPING IN </p><p>THE WOODS" (FROM A PRE-WAR POPULATION OP 356,000 MUSLIMS </p><p>AND 181,000 CROATS).  HE SOUGHT A CLEARLY WORDED STATEMENT </p><p>PROM THE WEST TO PUT THE SERBS ON NOTICE THAT ETHNIC </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02326  01 OF 03  161531Z </p><p>CLEANSING MUST CEASE IMMEDIATELY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED SYMPATHY POR THE CARDINAL\'S </p><p>CONCERNS BUT QUESTIONED WHETHER MORE WORDS WOULD MAKE ANY </p><p>DIPFERENCE.  HE NOTED THAT THE WORLD HAD ALREADY MADE </p><p>CLEAR TO THE SERB AUTHORITIES THAT THEY WOULD BE HELD </p><p>ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN BANJA LUKA AND ELSEWHERE. </p><p>HE CITED THE WORK OF THE INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL </p><p>AND THE EFFORTS BY THE USG TO COLLECT EVIDENCE OP WAR </p><p>CRIMES AND ATROCITIES.  YET IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE SERBS </p><p>ONLY UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF PORCE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ASKED IP HE SAW ANY CHANCE THAT THE SERBIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>CHURCH MIGHT PLAY A ROLE IN BRINGING ABOUT A PEACE </p><p>SETTLEMENT, KUHARIC REPLIED THAT SERBIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH </p><p>WAS A NATIONAL CHURCH.  ALTHOUGH THERE EXISTS MORE THAN </p><p>ONE CURRENT, AND SOME MODERATES ARE INCLINED TOWARD A JUST </p><p>SOLUTION, THE LEADERSHIP VIEWS THE WAR AS A "FIGHT AGAINST </p><p>ISLAM IN EUROPE AND CATHOLICISM IN THE BALKANS."  THEY </p><p>EMBRACE THE RIGHT OF ALL SERRS TO LIVE IN ONE STATE AND AS </p><p>SUCH ARE ALIGNED WITH THE MORE RADICAL POLITICAL ELEMENTS </p><p>SUCH AS KARADZIC. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p>CARDINAL STILL FIGHTING OLD BATTLES TO "CORRECT" HISTORY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  TURNING TO CROATIA, THE AMBASSADOR OPINED THAT A PEACE </p><p>PROCESS WAS POSSIBLE BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE CROATS TO </p><p>RETHINK HOW THEY VIEW SERBS.  REPEATED REFERENCES TO SERBS </p><p>AS A "MINORITY" MAKE THEM FEEL UNWELCOME AND INFERIOR. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02326  01 OF 03  161531Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  KUHARIC REPLIED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE SERBS HAVE ALWAYS </p><p>BEEN A MINORITY IN CROATIA, THEY FORMERLY FUNCTIONED AS A </p><p>MAJORITY.  AFTER RULING FOR 75 YEARS THEY DO NOT WANT TO </p><p>ACCEPT MERE "EQUALITY."  FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SERBS ARE LAID </p><p>OFF FROM A JOB THEY CLAIM DISCRIMINATION, IGNORING THE </p><p>FACT THAT THOUSANDS OF CROATS ARE LAID OFF AS WELL. </p><p>KUHARIC THEN RECITED THE FAMILIAR LITANY OF SERB ABUSES </p><p>AGAINST THE CROATIAN PEOPLE BEGINNING IN 1918 WHEN A GROUP </p><p>OF CROATS PROTESTING THE CREATION OF YUGOSLAVIA WERE FIRED </p><p>UPON IN ZAGREB\'S MAIN SQUARE AND ENDING WITH THE JNA </p><p>ARMING THE LOCAL MILITIAS IN 1991.  HE ARGUED THAT "THOSE </p><p>WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FREE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY </p><p>OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SLAVES." </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE AMBASSADOR COMMENTED THAT A SERB MIGHT RECITE A </p><p>SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT HISTORY OF YUGOSLAVIA, FOCUSSING MORE </p><p>ON THE WWII NDH GOVERNMENT AND THE JASENOVAC CONCENTRATION </p><p>CAMP. </p><p> </p><p>9.  THIS COMMENT LED THE CARDINAL TO DECLARE THAT, WHILE </p><p>"IT WOULD BE A CRIME IF JUST ONE MAN WAS KILLED AT </p><p>JASENOVAC," THE CHARGE THAT 700,000 WERE SLAUGHTERED COULD </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ6587 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6587 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02326  02 OF 03  161532Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-01   OASY-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  FBIE-00  INLB-01  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-08 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-01     ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01     SP-00    SS-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-01  PMB-00   PRMC-01 </p><p>      DRL-09   G-00       /031W </p><p>                  ------------------D096C1  161621Z /38 </p><p>R 161609Z JUN 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6155 </p><p>INFO USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAKU </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ZAGREB 002326 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROME ALSO FOR VATICAN </p><p>BAKU FOR DCM FINN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 06/15/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, HR, (KUHARIC, F) </p><p>SUBJECT:  CROATIA\'S CARDINAL UNABLE TO ESCAPE HISTORY </p><p> </p><p>NOT BE TRUE OR THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY SERBS LEFT IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02326  02 OF 03  161532Z </p><p>CROATIA.  HE CITED NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF WWII ATROCITIES </p><p>COMMITTED AGAINST CROATS.  HE EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>"PITY OVER EVERY TOMB" BUT REFUSED TO ACCEPT "HALF A </p><p>CENTURY OF UNJUST PROPAGANDA AND LIES."  HE INSISTED THAT </p><p>ONE CANNOT CONDEMN AN ENTIRE NATION FOR CRIMES COMMITTED </p><p>BY ITS LEADERS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>PRINCIPLES CLEAR BUT RECONCILIATION WILL BE LONG </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT WAS PRECISELY THE POINT. </p><p>IF PEOPLE INSIST ON FIGHTING THE BATTLES OF THE PAST THERE </p><p>CAN BE NO FUTURE.  CROATIA, AS A NEW, INDEPENDENT STATE, </p><p>CAN AFFORD TO BE GENEROUS TO THE SERBS WHO LIVE HERE. </p><p>SUCH A POLICY IS NOT ONLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO, IT ALSO </p><p>MAKES SENSE IN THE QUEST FOR PEACE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE CARDINAL RESPONDED SAYING THE SERBS DO NOT WANT </p><p>PEACE AND THAT IS WHY THEY STARTED THE WAR.  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT IN 1991 IT WAS NOT THE SERBIAN </p><p>PEOPLE BUT THE YUGOSLAV NATIONAL ARMY AND CERTAIN LEADERS </p><p>IN KNIN WHO CHOSE TO FIGHT AGAINST AN INDEPENDENT CROATIA. </p><p>THE MAJORITY OF SERBS CHOSE TO REMAIN IN CROATIA AND NOW </p><p>THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT MUST CONVINCE THESE PEOPLE TO </p><p>ACCEPT REALITY AND MAKE THEM FEEL WELCOME. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE CARDINAL EXPRESSED HIS AGREEMENT SAYING THAT THE </p><p>PRINCIPLES ARE CLEAR BUT THE PROCESS WILL BE LONG AND </p><p>HARD.  ONE MUST UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE VICTIMS, </p><p>THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT A SERB AFTER HE HAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02326  02 OF 03  161532Z </p><p>DESTROYED YOUR HOUSE AND MURDERED YOUR FAMILY.  TO WHICH </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR REPLIED THAT THE ANGER MUST BE DIRECTED </p><p>TOWARD THE CRIMINAL, NOT TOWARD ALL SERBS. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  KUHARIC IS CLEARLY WELL-INTENTIONED AND HAS TRIED TO </p><p>PUT INTO PRACTICE THE TOLERANCE THAT HE PREACHES.  ON </p><p>NUMEROUS OCCASIONS HE HAS REACHED OUT TO CROATIA\'S OTHER </p><p>RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES.  DURING THE WAR IN 1991 HE VISITED </p><p>AN ORTHODOX CHURCH NEAR THE FRONTLINES AND SPOKE OUT </p><p>AGAINST ANY ATTEMPTS TO TAKE REVENGE ON CROATIA\'S ORTHODOX </p><p>COMMUNITY.  HE HAS STEADFASTLY SUPPORTED A UNITED BOSNIA </p><p>AND CAME UNDER STRONG CRITICISM IN OFFICIAL CIRCLES AND </p><p>EVEN AMONG HIS OWN CLERGY WHEN HE PROTESTED CRIMES </p><p>COMMITTED AGAINST MUSLIMS DURING THE CROAT-MUSLIM CONFLICT </p><p>IN B-H.  FORMER "HERCEG-BOSNA PRESIDENT" MATE BOBAN WROTE </p><p>AN OPEN LETTER ACCUSING KUHARIC OF "BETRAYING THE </p><p>INTERESTS OF THE CROATIAN PEOPLE." </p><p> </p><p>14.  BUT, LIKE SO MANY CROATS (ESPECIALLY OF HIS </p><p>GENERATION), HE APPEARS UNABLE TO SHAKE THE DUST OF </p><p>HISTORY OFF HIS FEET AND GIVE UP THE OLD BATTLES OF WHO </p><p>DID WHAT TO WHOM AND WHEN.  ALSO, LIKE MOST CROATS, HE IS </p><p>UNABLE TO PUT HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF OTHERS AND SEE WHAT </p><p>DAILY LIFE AND ECONOMIC PROSPECTS MUST LOOK LIKE TO THE </p><p>AVERAGE SERB LIVING IN CROATIA.  ISOLATED BECAUSE OF HIS </p><p>POSITION, HE FINDS IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SERBS ARE NOT </p><p>ALWAYS TREATED "EQUALLY" IN CROATIAN SOCIETY.  SO, WHILE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02326  02 OF 03  161532Z </p><p>HE CAN PROBABLY BE COUNTED ON TO SPEAK UP IN THE FACE OF </p><p>BLATANT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, HE IS NOT LIKELY TO PLAY </p><p>A FORCEFUL LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF NATIONAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>BIO NOTE </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  FRANJO CARDINAL KUHARIC TURNED 75 ON APRIL 15, 1994 </p><p>AND, ACCORDING TO CANON LAW, SHOULD BE FACING MANDATORY </p><p>RETIREMENT.  HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGN THAT THE </p><p>CARDINAL IS ABOUT TO STEP DOWN NOR HAS A COADJUTOR BEEN </p><p>NAMED.  GIVEN THAT NOTHING WAS SAID ON THE SUBJECT DURING </p><p>THE VISIT OF POPE JOHN PAUL II TO ZAGREB LAST SEPTEMBER, </p><p>IT IS GENERALLY FELT THAT THE CARDINAL WILL BE ALLOWED TO </p><p>REMAIN ON FOR AT LEAST A FEW MORE YEARS. </p><p>- </p><p> </p><p>16.  THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OPEN SPECULATION OVER KUHARIC\'S </p><p>POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS.  THOSE MOST FREQUENTLY MENTIONED ARE </p><p>HIS SECRETARY, STJEPAN KOZUL; ZAGREB\'S ASSISTANT BISHOPS </p><p>MARKO CULEJ AND JURAJ JEZERINAC (RECENTLY RETURNED FROM </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNNPTQ6593 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6593 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02326  03 OF 03  161532Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-01 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-01   OASY-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  FBIE-00  INLB-01  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-08 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-01     ADS-00   M-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-01    PM-00    PRS-01   P-01     SP-00    SS-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  SNIS-00  NISC-01  PMB-00   PRMC-01 </p><p>      DRL-09   G-00       /031W </p><p>                  ------------------D096CD  161621Z /38 </p><p>R 161609Z JUN 95 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6156 </p><p>INFO USLO SKOPJE </p><p>AMEMBASSY BAKU </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY SARAJEVO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>NATO EU COLLECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 ZAGREB 002326 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ROME ALSO FOR VATICAN </p><p>BAKU FOR DCM FINN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: 06/15/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, HR, (KUHARIC, F) </p><p>SUBJECT:  CROATIA\'S CARDINAL UNABLE TO ESCAPE HISTORY </p><p> </p><p>CANADA); THE BISHOP OF SIBENIK, SRECKO BADURINA; CARITAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02326  03 OF 03  161532Z </p><p>DIRECTOR MONSIGNOR VLADIMIR STANKOVIC AND SARAJEVO </p><p>ARCHBISHOP VINKO PULJIC PRIOR TO HIS BEING MADE A CARDINAL </p><p>IN HIS OWN RIGHT IN NOVEMRER OF LAST YEAR.  ALL ARE </p><p>RELATIVELY YOUNG (LATE 40\'S EARLY 50\'S) EXCEPT BADURINA </p><p>WHO IS ALSO SAID TO BE IN POOR HEALTH. </p><p> </p><p>17.  KUHARIC APPEARS TO ENJOY EXCELLENT HEALTH AND IS </p><p>THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE THE RIGHT PERSON TO GUIDE THE </p><p>REGION\'S CATHOLIC POPULATION THROUGH THESE TROUBLED TIMES. </p><p>THE CARDINAL IS VALUED AS A MEDIATOR.  HE HAS KEPT HIS </p><p>LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN WITH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH.  IN </p><p>MAY OF 1994 KUHARIC MET IN SARAJEVO WITH SERBIAN ORTHODOX </p><p>PATRIARCH PAVLE AND RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH ALEKSEJ II. </p><p>TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN HE MET WITH JOVAN PAVLOVIC, </p><p>METROPOLITAN FOR CROATIA, SLOVENIA AND ITALY (RESIDENT IN </p><p>LJUBLJANA).  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR LEFT HIS OFFICE, VELJKO </p><p>KNEZEVIC, THE HEAD OF THE FRY\'S LIAISON OFFICE IN ZAGREB </p><p>WAS WAITING IN THE ANTEROOM. </p><p> </p><p>18.  AFTER THROWING THE CHURCH\'S UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT </p><p>BEHIND THE HDZ DURING CROATIA\'S STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE, </p><p>KUHARIC WAS QUICK TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM TUDJMAN AND THE </p><p>OFFICIAL PARTY AFTERWARDS.  HE HAS OPENLY OPPOSED THE IDEA </p><p>OF CROATIAN STATE IN WHICH CROATS WOULD HAVE GREATER </p><p>RIGHTS THAN OTHER NATIONALITIES.  IN AUGUST OF 1993, AFTER </p><p>THE FEAST OF THE ASSUMPTION ON WHICH TUDJMAN DELIVERED A </p><p>POLITICAL ADDRESS IN A DALMATIAN CHURCH, THE CARDINAL </p><p>STRICTLY FORBID THAT ANY POLITICIAN BE PERMITTED SPEAK ON </p><p>CHURCH PREMISES.  HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH TUDJMAN HAS BEEN </p><p>COOL.  A TUDJMAN AIDE REPORTEDLY ASKED ONCE, "WHY DOESN\'T </p><p>THE CARDINAL INVITE THE PRESIDENT IN FOR A COFFEE WHEN HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02326  03 OF 03  161532Z </p><p>COMES TO MASS IN THE CATHEDRAL?" </p><p> </p><p>19.
