<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 009045 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS USTR </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA/MAC/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, KIPR, TU </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOT Response on Doha Declaration on TRIPS and </p><p>Public Health </p><p> </p><p>Ref: State 245178 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Oya Karakas, Head of Department in the MFA General </p><p>Directorate of Multilateral Economic Affairs, sent </p><p>Embassy the following reply on the issue of compulsory </p><p>pharmaceuticals licensing for countries facing public </p><p>health crises.  The Turkish position notes that these </p><p>provisions are aimed at the least developed countries, </p><p>but does not positively respond to the U.S. proposal </p><p>that OECD countries opt out of the right to become a </p><p>beneficiary importer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Begin Text MFA Reply: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>No. CEGY-I </p><p>December 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The  relationship between the TRIPS Agreement and public </p><p>health is an important issue. Given the pressing urgency </p><p>of  the public health problems of certain countries  and </p><p>the   potential  threats  faced  by  some   others,   an </p><p>expeditious  solution  should  be  found  as   soon   as </p><p>possible,  as foreseen in the paragraph 6  of  the  Doha </p><p>Ministerial Declaration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We  recognize  the importance of public health  and  the </p><p>legitimate  concerns  of some countries  in  this  area. </p><p>Public health cannot be discussed only in terms of trade </p><p>concerns   and  economic  interests,  its   social   and </p><p>humanitarian dimension should also be taken into account </p><p>properly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However,  this issue should not either be a  pretext  to </p><p>undermine  the  protection of patent rights.  We  attach </p><p>great   importance  to  the  principles  of  the   TRIPS </p><p>Agreement  and the international norms in the  field  of </p><p>intellectual property protection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As  we  have expressed on several occasions, we  believe </p><p>that  the  TRIPS Agreement provides members with  enough </p><p>room  for  flexibility in case of emergency  situations. </p><p>Therefore,  while conducting negotiations to fulfil  the </p><p>mandate  of  paragraph 6, existing possibilities  within </p><p>the Agreement should be taken into account and examined. </p><p>In  case  of  a deficiency, further measures  should  be </p><p>sought in order to enable these countries to solve their </p><p>public  health  problems. Nevertheless,  these  measures </p><p>should also contain safeguards to prevent abuse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As  a  developing country, we have certain sensitivities </p><p>regarding  public health and developing  countries  have </p><p>different concerns regarding their public health policy. </p><p>These  concerns  should be addressed in  a  satisfactory </p><p>manner. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In  our view, the development aspect is one of the  main </p><p>elements of the WTO negotiations; therefore the concerns </p><p>of  developing  countries  should  be  given  sufficient </p><p>attention.   Needless   to  say,   the   least-developed </p><p>countries are the primary focus of our task and at  this </p><p>stage there should not be discrimination among them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While   conducting  negotiations  on  this  issue,   the </p><p>existing  WTO  framework and structure should  be  taken </p><p>into  account  and we should not create new  categories. </p><p>Currently,  WTO members are classified in three  groups: </p><p>namely   developed,   developing   and   least-developed </p><p>members. We are against creation of new categories, such </p><p>as OECD countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>If developing members with high income per capita are to </p><p>be granted certain flexibilities as the outcome of these </p><p>negotiations,  other  developing members  with  a  lower </p><p>level of income per capita cannot be excluded from  this </p><p>scheme. </p><p>End Text. </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
