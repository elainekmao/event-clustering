(SBU)  Summary: Our forecast for Germany for this </p><p>year and next is for continued slow growth with a </p><p>modest pick up in 2004 driven by net exports.  While </p><p>1.3% real growth in 2004 might be deemed a "recovery" </p><p>after 0.1% growth in 2003 it is mostly closing a part </p><p>of the output gap that has opened during three years of </p><p>stagnation.  Unemployment will remain in the 10.7% </p><p>range and the government deficit will remain above 3% </p><p>of GDP.  This forecast incorporates possible effects of </p><p>structural reforms announced in the agenda 2010 package </p><p>(reftel), but these are likely to cause a drag on </p><p>growth in their first year of implementation, with </p><p>positive effects following in 2005 and later.  End </p><p>Summary </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Risks to this forecast are principally on the </p><p>downside - that is the balance of risks suggest that </p><p>the actual situation is more likely to worsen than </p><p>improve.  The absence of robust bank lending, weaker </p><p>external demand, faster appreciation of the euro </p><p>against the USD are some of the risks.  Deflation is </p><p>another, which we give only an outside chance of </p><p>materializing next year. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  This forecast incorporates budget data from </p><p>the Government\'s recently released 2004 budget, </p><p>including bringing income tax cuts a year forward from </p><p>January 2005 to January 2004.  We have not yet </p><p>estimated the possible effects on growth, although </p><p>other estimates range from 0.3 to 0.6 percentage points </p><p>of higher growth.  Stimulus from income tax cuts could </p><p>help offset some of the drag from structural reforms </p><p>but carry other risks, e.g. higher deficits and debt </p><p>service. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Taking a broader view, investment will be a </p><p>key to turning over Germany\'s growth engine.  Declining </p><p>investment has been a contributing factor to Germany\'s </p><p>lackluster growth performance in the 1990\'s. </p><p>Investment growth could be supported by relatively </p><p>lower price and wage increases in Germanythan in its </p><p>euro area partners and lower non-wage labor costs </p><p>promised by structural reforms. Combined with income </p><p>tax reductions, the announcement effect of such a </p><p>comprehensive program on investors as well as consumers </p><p>could be positive.  This, then, would be the upside </p><p>risks to the forecast. </p><p> </p><p>Growth Prospects for 2003 and 2004: Slow Growth, Modest </p><p>Recovery </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Seasonally adjusted real GDP is likely to grow </p><p>slower than previously forecast:  0.1% in 2003, down </p><p>from 0.7% and 1.3% in 2004 down from 1.8%.  The first </p><p>quarter\'s unexpected   0.2% decline compared to the </p><p>fourth quarter last year has made even modest growth </p><p>improbable for 2003. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) After years of flat growth a modest pick up in </p><p>net exports in 2004 should spark growth of 1.3%, hardly </p><p>a recovery as the economy has been stagnating and the </p><p>output gap between actual performance and potential has </p><p>widen.  2004 growth on a non-seasonally adjusted basis </p><p>should improve to 1.8% due to four more working days in </p><p>the calendar year. </p><p> </p><p>Indicators and Sentiment Show No Sign of Recovery </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  Business climate indicators do not signal any </p><p>significant upswing.  The ZEW indicator has flattened </p><p>after rising for six months and is still will below its </p><p>historical average.  The ifo index rise in May, the </p><p>first up tick since January, was weak, driven by </p><p>expectations. But the assessment of current economic </p><p>conditions remains poor.  The economic sentiment </p><p>indicator (ESI) for Germany from the EU Business and </p><p>Consumer Survey shows stagnation at a very low level. </p><p>Expectations concerning production, unemployment and </p><p>the general economic situation over next 12 months have </p><p>deteriorated, underpinning our forecast for continued </p><p>stagnation in 2003. </p><p> </p><p>Is there evidence that something will trigger a change </p><p>in current trends? At the moment we do not see any. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  The increase in private consumption  in  the </p><p>first  quarter was unique and will not continue in  the </p><p>next  three  quarters (see below).  One factor  driving </p><p>weak  private consumption is a lack of confidence in  a </p><p>better   outlook.   New  paper  reports  suggest   that </p><p>consumers are wary and anxious about high unemployment, </p><p>climbing  social taxes, financial difficulties  of  the </p><p>Government   and   states  and  that  the   operational </p><p>effectiveness of economic politics has declined. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  Recapturing the population\'s trust will not </p><p>be easy.  The controversy over economic reforms that </p><p>began last September shows no sign of abating.   Clear </p><p>outcomes that could contribute to more confidence , as </p><p>well as a conviction that a comprehensive economic </p><p>program is being put into place, could help restore </p><p>consumers\' trust and interest. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  On the business side the sentiment  is  not </p><p>any  better.  Entrepreneurs have been coping with  high </p><p>non-wage labour costs and structural restraints. Agenda </p><p>2010   reforms  should  help  somewhat,  provided   the </p><p>promised  reforms are put into place.   Heated  debates </p><p>over  the reforms, and rumors of possible tax hikes  to </p><p>ease the government budget deficit, put into doubt what </p><p>the government will actually end up doing, contributing </p><p>to  uncertainty  and  delays in  investment  decisions. </p><p>Enterprises  place their hope, once again,  on  foreign </p><p>demand.  Such demand will be only slightly affected  by </p><p>the  euro appreciation as most German exports go to the </p><p>euro area; imports should pick up, leaving a small  net </p><p>trade  surplus to drive recovery in 2003 and  a  larger </p><p>one in 2004. </p><p> </p><p>First Quarter of 2003: False Start - Domestic Demand </p><p>Not Sustainable </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU)  Analysts note that despite the first quarter </p><p>decline, the composition of demand was encouraging. </p><p>Domestic demand grew while net exports declined, a </p><p>potential sign that Germany could begin to grow its own </p><p>way of economic stagnation rather than relying on a </p><p>revival of external demand.  We are not so optimistic. </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU)  First quarter dynamics were attributable  to </p><p>one-off factors that will reverse in the course of  the </p><p>year.   The savings rate was drawn down from  10.6%  to </p><p>10.4% and net disposable incomes were higher due  to  a </p><p>raise  in  entrepreneurial and  interest  income.   Net </p><p>income actually shrank by 0.4% compared to the previous </p><p>quarter  due  to January\'s increases in  payroll  taxes </p><p>(higher pension contributions (from 19.1% to 19.5%) and </p><p>health insurance (from 14.1% to 14.4%) and higher taxes </p><p>on  petroleum, electricity, (i.e. the next step of  the </p><p>"Eco-tax" reform) and tobacco. </p><p> </p><p>Other elements of domestic demand provide little </p><p>comfort. </p><p> </p><p>13. (SBU)  Investment declined significantly by 1.7% in </p><p>the   first  quarter  due  to  a  tremendous  fall   in </p><p>construction  investment. Taking into account  capacity </p><p>utilization,  production and order entries,  investment </p><p>is   unlikely   to  advance  in  the  second   quarter. </p><p>Manufacturing capacity utilization is still  under  its </p><p>long-term average, although the trend is up. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU)  Construction decreased in the first quarter </p><p>by  3.3%  due  in part to the extremely  cold  weather. </p><p>Even  though  the  sector continues  to  work  off  its </p><p>overcapacity, a gleam of hope in the first quarter  was </p><p>an  increase  in  building permits. This  rise  may  be </p><p>attributed  to  the heated political  discussion  about </p><p>cutting housing subsidies, provoking an unusual  amount </p><p>of  applications  for  permits.   Those  with  building </p><p>permits  would be entitled to the subsidy. Low interest </p><p>rates  provide an incentive for immediate  construction </p><p>even  though  the  building permit is  valid  for  five </p><p>years.  Thus, construction in the housing sector should </p><p>rise  in  the  second and third quarters.  Nonetheless, </p><p>continued  reduction  in overall  capacity  will  still </p><p>result in a drag on GDP growth. </p><p> </p><p>Government  consumption, constrained by  rising  budget </p><p>deficits, will remain modest. </p><p> </p><p>The Story is Still External Led Growth </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU)  The base scenario of the forecast remains </p><p>for net exports to drive a gradual recovery in 2004: </p><p>the rest of Euro area - taking 54.7% of German exports </p><p>-- will grow faster than Germany.  Thus, German exports </p><p>are insulated to a significant extent from much of the </p><p>effects of the euro\'s appreciation.  In nominal terms, </p><p>the euro is up 16.5% against the USD during the first </p><p>half of 2003.  A revival of foreign demand in 2004 both </p><p>inside and outside the euro area should help override </p><p>some of the price effects of more dear euro outside the </p><p>euro area as German exports compete in high-end, </p><p>quality and custom markets and between related firms </p><p>where product substitution is difficult. </p><p> </p><p>Fiscal Deficit: Over Maastricht Threshold </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU)  The Government deficit will climb to 3.9% of </p><p>GDP in 2003.  Revenue is likely to decline as suggested </p><p>by the results of the May tax estimate and our new GDP </p><p>forecast. The result: a fiscal deficit of euro 41 </p><p>billion. For 2004 the deficit will continue to be </p><p>driven by revenue losses and draws by social insurance </p><p>programs.  The planned 2004 budget contains euro 15.9 </p><p>billion in measures to reduce the deficit to around </p><p>euro 26 billion.  However, bringing forward the income </p><p>tax cut would add another euro 7 billion to the Federal </p><p>deficit and the same amount to the state deficits and </p><p>around euro 2.5 billion deficit at the local levels. </p><p>Thus, the overall government deficit will stay around </p><p>3.8% of GDP.  Germany would neither meet its political </p><p>commitment to reduce the nominal deficit below 3% in </p><p>2003 nor in 2004, the year in which Germany\'s excessive </p><p>deficit is to be corrected under the rules of the EU </p><p>Stability and Growth Pact. </p><p> </p><p>CPI: Practically Price Stability </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU)  Consumer price increases will remain </p><p>subdued, even declining on a quarterly basis for some </p><p>of the year due to the euro appreciation and lower oil </p><p>prices, but rising overall at an annual average rate of </p><p>0.8% in 2003 and 0.9% in 2004 as demand begins to rise. </p><p> </p><p>18.  (SBU)   Consumer prices rose in the first  quarter </p><p>2003  by  0.7% over the previous quarter  and  by  1.1% </p><p>compared  to  a year ago.  In April and in  May  prices </p><p>declined  slightly  on a monthly basis  due  to  strong </p><p>price  declines  in  heating oil and  gas  (oil  prices </p><p>decreased  immediately after the end of the  Iraq  war; </p><p>the price decline was reinforced by Euro appreciation). </p><p>These  effects will continue throughout the year (basis </p><p>effects), partially offset by rises in services prices. </p><p> </p><p>Unemployment: No Cause for Joy </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU)  The number of unemployed will increase by </p><p>9.8% in 2003 and decline by 1.6% in 2004 as economic </p><p>growth picks up.   The unemployment rate will remain </p><p>around 10.7%. </p><p> </p><p>Forecast Risks:  On the Downside </p><p> </p><p>20. (SBU)  Risks remain as in the previous forecast, </p><p>principally on the down side: lack of robust bank </p><p>lending, weaker external demand, faster and higher </p><p>appreciation of the euro/USD exchange rate. </p><p> </p><p>21. (SBU)  The lack of clear, fully agreed government </p><p>fiscal and reform policies or actions with attendant </p><p>political uncertainties weighs on consumer confidence - </p><p>a factor that could continue into 2004.  Deflation is </p><p>not a feature in our forecast but is an outside risk </p><p>toward the latter part of the forecast horizon, </p><p>particularly if the anticipated upswing does not take </p><p>hold. </p><p> </p><p>A Broader View: Growth, Deflation and Fiscal Expansion </p><p> </p><p>22. (SBU)  This forecast has been composed in a period </p><p>of fluidity: the government has announced a major </p><p>structural reform initiative, subsidy cuts, and </p><p>significant tax reductions by bringing forward to 2004 </p><p>income tax cuts scheduled for 2005.  This section takes </p><p>a step back and seeks to discern a line of logic in </p><p>these measures that could give a basis for a more </p><p>optimistic scenario than we have assumed. One way to </p><p>look at what is going on is that relatively low </p><p>inflation and structural reforms with tax cuts could </p><p>help counter act the weak investment performance that </p><p>has plagued Germany for nearly a decade. Both these </p><p>mechanisms, structural reforms and relative price </p><p>adjustments, are the "tools" now available to Germany </p><p>in the monetary union to adapt to "shocks" it has </p><p>suffered during reunification. </p><p> </p><p>Why Weak Growth? </p><p> </p><p>23. (SBU)  The European Commisson\'s 2002 "Review of </p><p>Germany\'s Growth Performance" points to several factors </p><p>that account for Germany\'s prolonged low growth and </p><p>vulnerabilities to external developments.  Low growth </p><p>stems from weak domestic demand: weak consumption and </p><p>investment, including in the construction sector. </p><p> </p><p>24. (SBU)  Large financial transfers to the new states, </p><p>around 4% of GDP annually, initially financed by larger </p><p>deficits, now are financed by higher taxes diverting </p><p>funds from social funds.  These funds, in turn, have </p><p>had to increase their contribution rates.  Higher taxes </p><p>and social charges crowd out private investment as </p><p>expected profits are reduced and adversely effect </p><p>employment, in the Commission\'s assessment.  Low </p><p>construction investment is the product of working off </p><p>excess capacity in both the new States and the West </p><p>from the heady early 1990 days of reunification and </p><p>high immigration. </p><p> </p><p>25. (SBU)  The recently released Bank for International </p><p>Settlements\' Annual Report also highlights the decline </p><p>in investment as "the strongest sign (if not cause) of </p><p>the underperformance of the German economy."  The BIS </p><p>believes that while partially cyclical, the low </p><p>propensity to invest is due to fundamental or </p><p>structural factors such as low rates of return, low </p><p>corporate profits, and product and labor market </p><p>rigidities. </p><p> </p><p>26. (SBU)  A study by Goldman Sachs suggests that the </p><p>massive cost shock from higher wages in the new states </p><p>and the West associated with reunification encouraged </p><p>firms to substitute capital for labor. Lower </p><p>profitability reduced the incentive to invest. The BIS </p><p>notes that since the early 1990\'s net investment in </p><p>Germany has fallen sharply.  Goldman Sachs points out </p><p>that compared to 1991 the real level of investment is </p><p>only 6.5% higher in Germany while in the rest of the </p><p>euro area it is 23% higher. In 2001 and 2002 investment </p><p>continued to decline, as we forecast it will this year. </p><p> </p><p>27. (SBU)  Lower inflation in Germany relative to that </p><p>in its main European trading partners suggests that its </p><p>external competitiveness will increase, supporting </p><p>exports and growth. This relative price adjustment is </p><p>one way regions experiencing relatively slower economic </p><p>activity in a monetary union can adjust.  Thus, </p><p>relatively lower inflation could benefit Germany. </p><p>However, it also raises the risk of deflation. </p><p> </p><p>The "D" Word </p><p> </p><p>28. (SBU)  While we have not found any economists to </p><p>declare that deflation is occurring in Germany, most </p><p>all will admit that there are risks, even the usually </p><p>reserved Bundesbank.  This is playing it safe.  There </p><p>is a general suspicion that, as the BIS explains, "a </p><p>seemingly benign low-inflation environment can turn </p><p>into one with disruptive deflation." Deflation can be </p><p>there before you know it.  Moreover, the costs are </p><p>high, more disruptive than inflation.  Many of these </p><p>adverse effects bear directly on investment. </p><p> </p><p>29. (SBU)  One definition of deflation is a decline in </p><p>the general price level on a sustained basis that </p><p>reduces demand.  This definition would rule out the </p><p>more benevolent form of price decreases due to supply </p><p>shocks, like new sources of supply or higher </p><p>productivity, that can drive down prices but contribute </p><p>to faster economic growth. Deflation that is pernicious </p><p>constricts investment: firms hold off investment as the </p><p>real cost of credits increase and profits are squeezed </p><p>because consumers hold off purchases and nominal wages </p><p>are "sticky," keeping production costs higher than </p><p>otherwise. </p><p> </p><p>30. (SBU)  It takes more than low inflation to move to </p><p>deflation, but Germany has a number of those other </p><p>necessary attributes.  A growing output gap, weak </p><p>credit growth, and soft equity prices are fertile </p><p>ground in Germany for deflation, according to a recent </p><p>IMF staff assessment. Nonetheless, the IMF paper </p><p>concluded that "mild deflation is likely to take hold" </p><p>but that "the risks of pernicious deflation are low." </p><p> </p><p>31. (SBU)  Deutsche Bank research developed its own </p><p>"scoreboard" of 10 indicators that gave Germany a 0.5 </p><p>compared to 0.7 in Japan where deflation has taken hold </p><p>and 0.4 in the US.  While they see some negative </p><p>inflation during the year, they give a 20-30% </p><p>probability that deflation could last for more than a </p><p>year, and a lower probability to dangerous deflation </p><p>taking hold.  This would require continued stagnation </p><p>in economic growth, continued low credit growth, a </p><p>substantial further appreciation of the euro to around </p><p>1.40/usd, inflation expectations would have to fall (no </p><p>signs yet that consumers expect lower prices - just </p><p>stable prices) and inflation in the euro area would </p><p>have to fall below 1%. </p><p> </p><p>32. (SBU)  This last point is worth noting.  The </p><p>European Central Bank asserts that price developments </p><p>in Germany cannot be considered in isolation from price </p><p>developments in the rest of the EMU.  The ECB considers </p><p>average euro area inflation and pitches its monetary </p><p>policy for price stability, i.e. price increases of 2% </p><p>or less, but still close to 2% to protect against </p><p>possible deflation (this latter point is an important </p><p>clarification recently issued by the ECB).  With Euro </p><p>area inflation still running around 2% and Germany\'s </p><p>inflation at 0.7%, that means other countries are </p><p>running substantially higher inflation than Germany. </p><p>As noted above, this should improve Germany\'s </p><p>competitive position within the euro area. </p><p> </p><p>33. (SBU)  Deutsche Bank research provides an </p><p>illustrative example.  The posit that if euro area </p><p>inflation were to remain around 2% (the ECB\'s </p><p>definition of price stability), Germany, with a weight </p><p>of 30% of the monetary union, would have to have </p><p>negative 1% inflation and the rest of the Euro area </p><p>would average 3.5% inflation - a gap of 4.5 percentage </p><p>points.  At such a spread there should be opportunities </p><p>for pricing arbitrage for tradable goods, raising </p><p>demand in Germany. </p><p> </p><p>Role of Fiscal Policy and Reforms </p><p> </p><p>34. (SBU)  Another way to counter the price shocks </p><p>adversely affecting investment could be reductions in </p><p>taxes and non-wage labor costs that have restrained </p><p>demand for labor and investment.  The Finance Minister </p><p>has politically linked advancing the income tax </p><p>reductions to adoption of structural reforms and a </p><p>trimmed 2004 deficit that is less than planned </p><p>investment.  In addition, some short-term stimulus to </p><p>economic growth from the tax reductions, estimated to </p><p>range from 0.3-0.6 percentage points, could help offset </p><p>the drag on growth from the early stages of structural </p><p>reforms. </p><p> </p><p>35. (SBU)  At a time when there is a risk of deflation </p><p>and confidence is fragile, the Government appears to be </p><p>seeking to take economic matters into its own hands. </p><p>This, Finance Ministry officials agree, should help </p><p>instill confidence in consumers and investors. </p><p> </p><p>36. (SBU)  The BIS suggests in its annual report that a </p><p>counter cyclical fiscal policy combined with an </p><p>expansionary monetary policy and other reforms would </p><p>provide a "more potent cocktail" of stimulus to deter </p><p>the threat of deflation.  However, in Germany a recent </p><p>survey (Infratest) suggests, that still 81% of </p><p>respondents were less satisfied or not at all satisfied </p><p>with the government\'s economic policies.  81% of the </p><p>respondents opposed taking on new debt to pay for </p><p>bringing forward the income tax cuts. This suggests </p><p>that rather than spending the savings from tax </p><p>reductions, many might save them in anticipation of </p><p>higher taxes in the future to help  reduce the debt. </p><p> </p><p>                   Forecast- Germany </p><p>     (Percent Increases - Unless Noted Otherwise) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                    2002         2003        2004 </p><p>               ACTUAL     FORECAST  FORECAST </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p>GDP :                0.2         0.1       1.8 </p><p> </p><p>CONSUMPTION:        -0.6         0.5       0.9 </p><p> </p><p>GOV.
