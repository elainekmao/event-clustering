<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EUR AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PREL, TU, Istanbul </p><p>SUBJECT: ISTANBUL ECONOMIC ANALYSTS: LOOKING FOR A LIFELINE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Pol/Econ Chief Stuart Smith.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  Summary: After a rocky start to the week on Monday, </p><p>word that the U.S. Iraq supplemental contains 1 billion USD </p><p>for Turkey has been seized on as a lifeline by Istanbul </p><p>markets and analysts.  Concern persists about the </p><p>sustainability of Turkey\'s debt, however.  Analysts suggest </p><p>any problem is unlikely to emerge immediately, as banks will </p><p>remain in the market and move to shore up their balance </p><p>sheets at the end of the quarter and cooperate with the </p><p>government to bring interest rates down.  The key wildcard </p><p>that could hinder that effort: individual bank\'s dollar </p><p>liquidity.  One banking contact estimates that 5 percent of </p><p>the system\'s 44 billion USD in assets has been withdrawn or </p><p>transferred overseas in recent days, a figure confirmed in </p><p>Ankara by BRSA sources (septel).  Other banks report that </p><p>after an initial "leakage" on the first day of hostilities, </p><p>the situation has stabilized.  Banking industry leaders </p><p>reviewed the situation in Ankara on March 26 with the </p><p>Treasury, Central Bank and BRSA.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) No credibility: Our contacts in Istanbul\'s financial </p><p>community are extremely critical of the AK government and its </p><p>mishandling of U.S. relations on Iraq.  Its mixed signals on </p><p>reintroducing the motions to support the U.S., and the </p><p>perception that State Minister Babacan deliberately misled </p><p>the markets before the Treasury\'s last debt auction, have </p><p>left its credibility in shreds.  The distrust was evident </p><p>over the weekend as Prime Minister Erdogan\'s message of </p><p>commitment to economic reform failed to sway market </p><p>sentiment.  Analysts at Bender Securities argue that "this </p><p>government is finished."  But, of equal concern, many </p><p>perceive that the problem extends beyond the government. </p><p>Yapi Kredi\'s Huseyin Imece characterizes the failure as one </p><p>in which the entire Turkish state shares responsibility, from </p><p>the President and military through the oppositin as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Isolation: Beyond the loss f American financial </p><p>assistance, which some see s survivable (Finansbank\'s Kerim </p><p>Kemahli notes tat Turkey was expected to muddle through </p><p>before he package appeared, and can still do so), concern </p><p>among Istanbul observers focused especially on a erception </p><p>that Turkey\'s bridges to the West and articularly to the </p><p>U.S. have been cut.  EU warnigs on Cyprus, coupled with </p><p>warnings from all quaters against Turkish intervention in </p><p>Northern Ira ("the last error remaining for Turkey to </p><p>commit" in Imece\'s description), shook the markets and </p><p>contributed to </p><p>nday\'s sharp sell-off.  Tuesday\'sreport of </p><p>a new and more modest U.S. assistance ackage has thus been </p><p>seized on as a lifeline.  Analysts recognize that the amount </p><p>(in the Turkish ontext) is relatively insignificant, and </p><p>congresional approval by no means assured, but nonetheless, </p><p>in Kemahli\'s and others\' view, the aid is an important signal </p><p>that the U.S. administration is not abandoning Turkey. </p><p>(Garanti Bank\'s Baris Kokoglu argued that even a promise of </p><p>billions from the EU would have less market impact than the </p><p>U.S. billion.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Debt Sustainability: All observers are now focused </p><p>on interest rates, Turkey\'s key economic indicator.  While </p><p>pessimism is marked at local brokerages (Bender\'s Murat </p><p>Gulkan and Emin Ozturk see an economy trying to navigate </p><p>between muddling through and "doomsday," with no real </p><p>upside), some bankers are more sanguine.  Kemahli argues that </p><p>the "moderate" reaction of the past week shows that the </p><p>Turkish economy has matured since the 2001 crisis, and will </p><p>weather the storm.  The banking sector is strong, he argues, </p><p>with banks liquid and without exposure to short positions on </p><p>the dollar.  Banks are taking paper losses because current </p><p>high rates negatively impact their balance sheet, but he and </p><p>his colleague Ozlem Cinemre characterize this more as an </p><p>"opportunity cost," in that deposit rates are so low the </p><p>banks are still making money on their entire portfolio. </p><p>Garanti\'s Kokoglu agrees, noting further that the banks have </p><p>no alternative but to stay in the bond market.  There is no </p><p>demand in the real sector for loans, reserve requirements </p><p>provide an incentive for bond holdings over loans in any </p><p>case, and other securities (such as U.S. bonds) do not offer </p><p>a high enough return to cover Turkish deposit rates.  Bender </p><p>analysts characterize the situation as a "Hotel California," </p><p>where all players are enjoying good profits, but cannot exit </p><p>the game. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Dollar liquidity: Given that ten banks constitute </p><p>the key market for Turkish t-bills, their liquidity is </p><p>critical to debt turnover.  On this issue, we are hearing </p><p>mixed messages.  Yapi\'s Huseyin Imece warned that "leakage" </p><p>from the system has reached 5 percent of its 44 billion USD </p><p>in total dollar assets, a figure confirmed by BRSA\'s Engin </p><p>Akcakoca, who told Embassy Ankara (see Ankara septel) that FX </p><p>withdrawals from March 14-15 totaled 1.8 billion USD.  Not </p><p>all banks are being equally affected, however.  Cinemre and </p><p>Kemahli noted that while there were some withdrawals on the </p><p>first day of military operations in Iraq (2 percent of the </p><p>Finansbank\'s 1.8 billion USD holdings), the situation had </p><p>since stabilized and that on Wednesday there was even a 20 </p><p>million USD inflow.  They noted too that withdrawals were not </p><p>driven by panic, as they were 2 years ago (when Finans was </p><p>forced to turn to merchants in the Grand Bazaar and its </p><p>German branches for stopgap liquidity), but by large </p><p>depositors comparison shopping in pursuit of increased </p><p>returns.  Kokoglu reported a similar pattern at Garanti. </p><p>However, he confirmed that the CEO\'s of major banks were </p><p>meeting in Ankara on March 26 with the BRSA, Central Bank, </p><p>and Treasury to review the situation and emphasized the </p><p>importance of Turkey\'s continued commitment to its reform </p><p>program.  The government no longer has any margin for error, </p><p>he stressed, and the markets will "swiftly punish" any </p><p>missteps. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Comment: From the Istanbul perspective, what started </p><p>as an extremely problematic week has been salvaged by the </p><p>public perception that the U.S. is not abandoning Turkey. </p><p>Analysts are united in their belief that to further soothe </p><p>the markets Turkey should avoid raising tensions by going </p><p>into Northern Iraq.  After the announcement of U.S. </p><p>assistance, they also see value in a reciprical goodwill </p><p>gesture by Turkey--such as opening airbases-- without seeking </p><p>a quid pro quo.  Most of all, they are looking for actions </p><p>rather than words from the government on the economy.  We </p><p>were struck, however, by the dividing line between the views </p><p>of Istanbul\'s bankers and stock market analysts.  While the </p><p>latter are uniformly gloomy, some of the former were more </p><p>sanguine--convinced that Turkey has seen worse before and </p><p>will ultimately weather the crisis, provided the war is short </p><p>and the government continues to follow IMF guidance.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
