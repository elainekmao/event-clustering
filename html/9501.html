<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 BRASILIA 002231 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR SCRONIN, KLEZNY </p><p>DEPT FOR E:ALARSON; WHA:CSTRUBLE, SPINKHAM; EB:BMANOGUE </p><p>NSC FOR JOANNA WALLACE </p><p>USDA FOR JBPENN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, BR, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) </p><p>SUBJECT: BRAZIL\'S ARSLANIAN: FTAA COMPROMISE POSSIBLE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Janice Fair, Economic Officer for Reason Section 1.5 (b) </p><p> and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary.  In an informal discussion with econoff on </p><p>July 13, Regis Arslanian, the GOB\'s new director of FTAA and </p><p>Mercosul-EU negotiations, acknowledged that Mercosul was </p><p>disappointed with the reaction it received during the San </p><p>Salvador TNC meeting to its proposal for restructuring the </p><p>FTAA negotiations and suggested that Brazil could accept a </p><p>compromise reformulation with the United States.  According </p><p>to Arslanian, a bilateral structure for market access </p><p>discussions is a key element for the GOB.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On July 13, while traveling back to Brasilia from the </p><p>FTAA Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) meeting in San </p><p>Salvador (July 8-11), econoff discussed Mercosul\'s take on </p><p>the meeting with Regis Percy Arslanian.  Arslanian has been </p><p>advisor to Itamaraty Secretary-General Pinheiro Guimaraes, </p><p>but told Econoff that he has been chosen to replace </p><p>Ambassador Carlos Simas Magalhaesas as Head of the </p><p>International Negotiations Department (FTAA and Mercosul-EU </p><p>negotiations) under Ambassador Luiz Filipe Macedo Soares, who </p><p>is Under Secretary for South America and Brazil\'s lead FTAA </p><p>negotiator at the Vice-Minister level.  Earlier, econoff was </p><p>told by Tovar da Silva Nunes, the GOB\'s FTAA Coordinator, </p><p>that Simas had been sacked on July 4 for not being in-sync </p><p>with Itamaraty FTAA policy directives. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) According to Arslanian, Mercosul was extremely </p><p>disappointed by the reaction it received at the TNC meeting </p><p>to its three-track proposal for restructuring the FTAA. </p><p>Roughly speaking, the three tracks refer to: Track 1- </p><p>bilateral market access negotiations (industrial and </p><p>agricultural goods, services, and investment) carried out </p><p>under the FTAA umbrella; Track 2- minimal rules to support </p><p>market access such as dispute settlement, rules of origin, </p><p>civil society, institutional issues, Hemispheric Cooperation </p><p>Program, etc.; and Track 3 - rules for services and </p><p>investment, intellectual property, competition policy, market </p><p>access and rules for government procurement, domestic </p><p>support, and trade remedies, all of which would be considered </p><p>only in the WTO. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Mercosul presented its proposal in the TNC plenary, </p><p>but the bulk of discussion took place in an informal session </p><p>during which most countries expressed concern with, and to a </p><p>certain extent criticism of, Mercosul\'s intention to reduce </p><p>the scope of the FTAA.  Arslanian said that the United States </p><p>and other countries did not fully appreciate the intense </p><p>domestic political and social pressure the GOB is under, and </p><p>reiterated that it would be impossible for Brazil/Mercosul to </p><p>complete the FTAA negotiations as currently structured. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) While other countries have suggested that a </p><p>comprehensive FTAA in both market access and rules is </p><p>necessary to foster economic integration and prosperity in </p><p>the region by encouraging strategic hemispheric partnerships </p><p>and attracting foreign direct investment, Brazil sees its </p><p>strategic needs differently.  Arslanian emphasized two </p><p>points:  the importance of the U.S. market for Brazilian </p><p>goods; and the importance of bilateral market access </p><p>negotiations as envisioned in Mercosul\'s three-track </p><p>proposal. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Arslanian stressed the GOB\'s interest in negotiating </p><p>access to the U.S. market within the FTAA.  However, he </p><p>registered disbelief that the U.S. is serious about giving </p><p>duty-free treatment to certain sensitive products, citing </p><p>orange juice and steel, in particular.  Econoff rebutted that </p><p>in the initial U.S. goods offer every tariff item was within </p><p>one of the four product baskets, each of which is slated to </p><p>go to zero-duty at some time, but pointed out that with </p><p>Mercosul\'s proposed wholesale removal of a number of issues </p><p>of interest to the United States from the FTAA, the U.S. </p><p>would undoubtedly have difficulty justifying such a </p><p>comprehensive market opening.  In response, Arslanian said </p><p>Mercosul would be willing to negotiate market access in </p><p>financial services and telecommunications with the United </p><p>States as trade-offs.  Pressed on whether Mercosul would </p><p>really be offering anything new in these areas, he answered </p><p>emphatically in the affirmative. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In explaining Brazil\'s rationale for seeking a </p><p>bilateral negotiating structure, Arslanian said that Brazil </p><p>believes other countries in the region (Central Americans, </p><p>etc.) are willing to give away much more than Brazil is in </p><p>market access for services and investment to gain an opening </p><p>of the U.S. goods market.   He reiterated several times that </p><p>Brazil will not "level" its interests to those of other </p><p>countries and would not accept a structure that would force </p><p>Brazil to make concessions based on other countries\' </p><p>willingness to "give away the store."  Echoing comments made </p><p>by Mercosul\'s Uruguayan lead during the TNC, Arslanian also </p><p>said that a bilateral process could focus the negotiation </p><p>more specifically on the interests of the parties involved </p><p>and make it easier to identify for political leaders and </p><p>society at large the trade-offs that are made to reach an </p><p>agreement.  He claimed that Mercosul will not submit any </p><p>offers in services, investment and government procurement </p><p>until a bilateral negotiating structure is approved. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Arslanian asked why the U.S. delegation to the TNC did </p><p>not discuss a baseline agreement approach that he believed </p><p>the USG had contemplated.  Econoff responded simply that the </p><p>USG did not have an official proposal to put forward. </p><p>Arslanian bemoaned the lack of such a discussion, opining </p><p>that between the three-track proposal and a baseline </p><p>agreement approach, a compromise could probably be reached, </p><p>as long as it includes a bilateral market access structure. </p><p>He intimidated that Mercosul could agree to include </p><p>government procurement market access under the FTAA and that </p><p>the negotiating forum for rules in services and investment, </p><p>and IPR could be revisited.  Arslanian also wondered aloud </p><p>about the possibility of a two-stage process, with deepening </p><p>(read as rules) coming in stage two, but was silent when </p><p>asked by econoff what guarantee the U.S. would have that </p><p>Brazil would undertake stage two negotiations if it obtained </p><p>the market access for goods that it wanted in stage one. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Comment:  Arslanian seemed eager to encourage a dialog </p><p>with the United States to develop a vision for the FTAA that </p><p>would satisfy both countries\' needs.  Given his past position </p><p>in the Itamaraty Secretary-General\'s Office and his new </p><p>position specifically overseeing the FTAA negotiations, we </p><p>are inclined to view his statements on GOB priorities and </p><p>possible flexibilities as credible.  See septel for Mission\'s </p><p>overview and analysis of factors affecting the GOB\'s latest </p><p>formulation of its FTAA policy.  End Comment. </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
