<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 ABUJA 000387 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR A/S WALTER KANSTEINER FROM AMBASSADOR JETER </p><p>ALSO FOR DS/IP/AF, DS/DSS/ITA, DS/ICI/PII AND AF/EX </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X1 </p><p>TAGS: AMGT, AEMR, ASEC, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ADDITIONAL CONTINGENCY PLANNING </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A. STATE 44229 </p><p>     B. B. ABUJA 339 </p><p>     C. C. 02 ABUJA 3332 </p><p>     D. D. 02 ABUJA 3333 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Ambassador Howard F. Jeter; Reason 1.5 (G). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Per ref A, Abuja and Lagos EACs met separately to </p><p>examine their respective security postures, including a </p><p>review of the possibility of reducing dependents and </p><p>non-essential personnel. The following are the results of </p><p>those deliberations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>EMBASSY ABUJA THREAT ASSESSMENT </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) There was unanimous agreement among Abuja EAC members </p><p>that as the likelihood of a conflict with Iraq increases, </p><p>large and possibly violent anti-American demonstrations will </p><p>occur in Nigeria, with a possibility of violent protests in </p><p>Abuja itself. There was also agreement that anti-American </p><p>demonstrations could serve as a catalyst to violence in </p><p>cities with existing ethnic or religious fault lines.  The </p><p>threat is mitigated somewhat by the GON,s recent success in </p><p>pre-empting two planned anti-American demonstrations. </p><p>However, the GON\'s ability to respond effectively to a truly </p><p>spontaneous protest was rated as questionable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S/NF) ORCA, DAO, and RSO were in agreement that there are </p><p>no new terrorist threats targeting American facilities or </p><p>personnel in Nigeria.  Existing threats were reported </p><p>previously.  A variety of multi-source reporting outlines </p><p>these threats. Although Nigeria was mentioned in a recent </p><p>public statement attributed to Usama bin Ladin, there was </p><p>agreement that there is no evidence of an increased terrorist </p><p>threat in Nigeria beyond that which already exists against </p><p>all American facilities worldwide. Moreover, the purported </p><p>UBL threat seemed to be directed against the GON. </p><p>Additionally, members agreed that the threat of Iraq </p><p>exploiting its official presence to conduct offensive </p><p>activity against Americans is heightened as the potential </p><p>conflict nears. The GON is aware of this potential threat and </p><p>are monitoring their activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>HOST COUNTRY CAPABILITIES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) There was unanimous agreement that the Government of </p><p>Nigeria (GON) has the political will to protect USG personnel </p><p>and property against attacks.  The GON recently pre-empted </p><p>two planned anti-American demonstrations in Abuja, deploying </p><p>significant additional security forces in the capital to </p><p>accomplish this task.  Embassy liaison activities indicate </p><p>that GON intelligence services are focusing on identifying </p><p>radical Islamic elements in-country and attempting to deter </p><p>violent anti-American protests.  The GON is also making a </p><p>concerted effort to educate the public about the nature of </p><p>the conflict in the Gulf, i.e., that it is political and not </p><p>directed at Islam. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Despite the GON,s strong political will, there was </p><p>unanimous agreement that without advance notice of protest, </p><p>the police likely cannot immediately control large </p><p>anti-American demonstrations. Violent demonstrations in </p><p>November 2002 related to the Miss World beauty pageant ended </p><p>the aura of immunity from political violence that the capital </p><p>had previously enjoyed. However, it was the Abuja EAC,s </p><p>assessment that the GON would use deadly force and deploy the </p><p>military to protect American personnel and property, if the </p><p>use of lethal force became necessary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANNING </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) With two exceptions, Abuja EAC members thought that an </p><p>authorized departure in anticipation of adverse reactions in </p><p>Nigeria was not appropriate under present circumstances.  One </p><p>of the two in favor stated that he was not unusually </p><p>concerned about official Americans but hoped that the </p><p>Mission\'s invocation of authorized departure would encourage </p><p>private Americans to depart Nigeria, reducing the target </p><p>profile of the relatively large American community presence. </p><p>The EAC examined the Abuja tripwires established in December </p><p>2002, shortly after the Miss World riots (ref C) and </p><p>determined that none of them had been crossed.  A canvass of </p><p>Mission employees revealed no &fear and apprehension in the </p><p>official American community" that had "risen to a point that </p><p>community members are interested in authorized departure8. </p><p>In fact, the responses were the opposite, with a significant </p><p>portion of Mission members expressing concern over being </p><p>unable to return to Nigeria if they use their recently </p><p>approved special R&R in the near future.  Several said they </p><p>would forego the special R&R if taking it seriously risked </p><p>precluding their return to Post. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) At this time the Abuja EAC agreed that the updated </p><p>Nigeria trip wires, Ref C, were still valid for Abuja and </p><p>endorsed the following immediate measures to increase the </p><p>overall security of American personnel and facilities in </p><p>Nigeria: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Restrict Mission visitors to those conducting "business </p><p>essential to the pursuit of priority USG objectives."  This </p><p>will reduce workload on the Mission and, in particular, will </p><p>allow ADM & RSO to focus on key infrastructure and security </p><p>issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Impose further travel restrictions on USG personnel, </p><p>including requiring a 48-hour advance notification and RSO </p><p>approval for non-emergency travel outside the capital city. </p><p>Travel to and through major Northern population centers would </p><p>be given special scrutiny. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Use of early PCS travel and liberal use of the special R&R </p><p>for non-essential personnel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Implementation of flexible work schedules. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Issuance of a stronger travel advisory (recommending that </p><p>non-essential travel to Nigeria be deferred). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Recommending to the COM that the third floor of the new </p><p>Chief of Mission Residence (not yet occupied) be designated </p><p>and prepared as Post,s new alternate command center. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The Abuja EAC endorsed the following measures to be </p><p>implemented upon the eventual onset of hostilities in Iraq: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Convening an EAC to assess host country response and </p><p>consider additional security measures. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Closure of the Embassy and USAID for an initial period of </p><p>two days. USAID will consider utilizing alternate work sites </p><p>such as employee residences, and the Embassy will be staffed </p><p>only by essential personnel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Non-essential employees and dependents will be instructed </p><p>to stay at home and monitor their Embassy-issued radio for </p><p>situation updates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Recommend closure of the American International School for </p><p>two days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- A warden message to private Americans advising of the </p><p>outbreak of hostilities, Embassy closure, and recommendations </p><p>on security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>CONSULATE GENERAL LAGOS THREAT ASSESSMENT </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S)  The Lagos Emergency Action Committee met February 21 </p><p>and voted with near unanimity against recommending authorized </p><p>departure at the present time.  Participants agreed that </p><p>there are currently no new or specific terrorist threats </p><p>against official Lagos personnel.  With one exception, EAC </p><p>members opposed authorized departure status. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (S) Participants acknowledged that the impending war </p><p>with Iraq may provoke reaction on the part of some Nigerians, </p><p>given the sympathy many Nigerian Muslims have for Iraq as a </p><p>Muslim nation and recent protests regarding Islamic </p><p>sensitivities (e.g. the Miss World riots in Abuja).  The EAC </p><p>agreed on the need to monitor events closely and review our </p><p>security assessment as the Iraq situation evolves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>HOST COUNTRY CAPABILITIES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>11.  (S)  In discussions with the police, RSO has learned </p><p>that the police intend to establish a road block at the </p><p>entrance to Walter Carrington Crescent to prevent </p><p>demonstrations from reaching the US Consulate and/or the </p><p>British Deputy High Commission.  That said, this action might </p><p>not take place faster than a demonstration could materialize. </p><p> However, several large contingents of police and private </p><p>security guards could be mobilized to protect their own </p><p>properties as well as ours, and could engage any </p><p>demonstrators that became violent.  A small military </p><p>contingent is situated at a Nigerian Army Post Exchange </p><p>across from the Consulate but the Exchange personnel are not </p><p>sufficient in number to provide significant security </p><p>assistance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>CONTINGENCY PLANNING </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (S) EAC explored potential alternatives to authorized </p><p>departure for those employees who feel threatened on an </p><p>individual basis.  Sections should be encouraged to </p><p>accommodate personnel who wish to: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---take R&R or personal leave; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---take other authorized leave; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---utilize Separate Maintenance Allowance status for EFMs; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---initiate early departure for non-essential employees </p><p>and/or early pack-out dates for employees scheduled for </p><p>Permanent Change of Station in the near future; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---consider early departure for PCS family members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To facilitate these options, Post Admin will continue to make </p><p>dollars available to those who elect to travel on personal </p><p>leave, and may request permission to increase the amount of </p><p>cash kept on-site for personnel access. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (S) The Lagos EAC recognized the fluid security </p><p>environment may require frequent reassessment meetings as </p><p>events unfold in the coming weeks.  Separately, POL and PAS </p><p>will explore additional strategies to positively impact the </p><p>security environment by countering the development of </p><p>anti-U.S. sentiment in Lagos.  Admin already has pro-forma </p><p>evacuation orders prepared for personnel in the event of any </p><p>move to departure status. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.  (S)  At this time, the Lagos EAC concluded that </p><p>previously established tripwires for Lagos are still valid. </p><p>However, as the Nigeria travel advisory applies to all parts </p><p>of Nigeria, members raised the potential need to review </p><p>and/or revise the advisory should U.S. military actions in </p><p>Iraq affect the local security environment.  Members agreed </p><p>that the local American public be duly notified via warden </p><p>message and travel advisory of known changes to their </p><p>security situation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.  (S)  To date, ConGen Lagos has </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---Increased visual presence of the guard force REACT at the </p><p>American Guest Quarters; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---Permanently assigned one member of the surveillance </p><p>detection unit at the American International School; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---Met with Public Affairs Section Employees to review their </p><p>security status; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---Briefed mailroom employees on procedures in the event of a </p><p>suspected chem/bio attack. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16.  (S) The EAC noted that the security situation might </p><p>differ for Abuja and Lagos should hostilities begin.  The </p><p>Lagos Consulate General recommends the following measures to </p><p>be implemented upon the eventual onset of hostilities in Iraq: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---Ask Nigerian authorities to immediately increase security </p><p>on Walter Carrington Crescent; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---Convene an EAC to assess host country response and </p><p>consider additional security measures; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---Close the Consulate General to all non-official visitors </p><p>with the exception of those requesting American citizen </p><p>services.  Close the Public Affairs Section on Lagos Island </p><p>for an initial period of one day until the security situation </p><p>is reassessed; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---Non-essential employees and dependents will be instructed </p><p>on further action via the radio network; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---Maintain close contact with the American International </p><p>School and recommend action based on the prevailing situation </p><p>in Lagos at the time; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---Send a warden message to private American citizens </p><p>advising them of the outbreak of hostilities, and provide </p><p>recommendations on security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>17. (SBU) The COM has reviewed this message and concurs with </p><p>the EAC,s recommendations. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
