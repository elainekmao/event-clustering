Taylor indicated an initial </p><p>interest in each of the five areas enumerated in reftel, </p><p>particularly the women and political participation issue.  He </p><p>stated, however, that Canada\'s interest in women\'s issues </p><p>extended beyond political participation into other arenas as </p><p>well. Taylor also said that he wanted to run the initiatives </p><p>past DFAIT\'s relevant functional bureaus before commenting </p><p>too extensively.  He promised to get back shortly with more </p><p>comments after conferring with his colleagues. </p><p> </p><p>2.(C)  Taylor indicated that Canada had not yet identified </p><p>its top priorities for  UNGA 58.  In addition, Taylor </p><p>admitted that Canada is unlikely to compile a cohesive list </p><p>of objectives having never done so previously.  He agreed, </p><p>however, to pass on pertinent information when it becomes </p><p>available. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
