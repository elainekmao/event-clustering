<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 JERUSALEM 002191 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PHUM, KISL, KWBG, IS </p><p>SUBJECT: IDF KILLS WANTED HAMAS ACTIVIST IN HEBRON </p><p> </p><p>REF: A.) JERUSALEM 2175; B.) JERUSALEM 1350; C.) </p><p>JERUSALEM 1357; D.) JERUSALEM 1855 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY.  A WANTED HAMAS IZZ ED-DIN AL-QASSAM </p><p>CELL MEMBER, TAHIR QAFISHA, WAS AMBUSHED AND SHOT </p><p>DEAD BY AN UNDERCOVER UNIT OF THE ISRAELI BORDER </p><p>POLICE JUNE 29 AT THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO HEBRON. </p><p>TWO HOMES IN WHICH QAFISHA ALLEGEDLY HID WERE </p><p>DEMOLISHED, AS WELL AS A STABLE AND MORE THAN 100 </p><p>TREES IN THE AREA (REFTEL A).  ISRAELI MILITARY </p><p>SOURCES SAID QAFISHA WAS THE LAST KNOWN MEMBER OF A </p><p>HEBRON IZZ ED-DIN AL-QASSAM CELL ALLEGEDLY </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF AT LEAST SIX ISRAELIS </p><p>IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS OVER THE PAST YEAR.  THE </p><p>DEMOLITIONS HAVE ANGERED HEBRONITES, WHO REMAIN </p><p>UNDER CURFEW AS A RESULT OF THE OPERATION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, AN UNDERCOVER UNIT </p><p>OF THE ISRAELI BORDER POLICE ACTING ON INTELLIGENCE </p><p>INFORMATION SURROUNDED A HOUSE AT THE NORTHERN </p><p>ENTRANCE OF HEBRON AT 3:30 AM JUNE 29 IN WHICH </p><p>WANTED HAMAS ACTIVIST TAHIR QAFISHA WAS REPORTEDLY </p><p>HIDING.  HEBRONITES SAID AN ISRAELI HELICOPTER </p><p>HOVERED OVER THE AREA SHINING A SEARCH LIGHT AS THE </p><p>OPERATION WAS CONDUCTED.  IDF SOURCES SAID QAFISHA </p><p>REFUSED TO SURRENDER.  IT IS UNCLEAR WHO FIRED </p><p>FIRST, BUT SHOOTING BROKE OUT BETWEEN THE SOLDIERS </p><p>AND QAFISHA, WHO SERIOUSLY WOUNDED A SOLDIER IN THE </p><p>HEAD BEFORE HE WAS SHOT DEAD AS HE TRIED TO BREAK </p><p>THROUGH THE CORDON OF SOLDIERS SURROUNDING HIM. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALTHOUGH THE OPERATION WAS OVER BY 5:30 AM, </p><p>ACCORDING TO UNRWA SOURCES, THE SOLDIERS CONTINUED </p><p>TO SWEEP THE AREA FOR ADDITIONAL SUSPECTS MANY </p><p>HOURS AFTER.  PRESS FOOTAGE SHOWED SOLDIERS COMBING </p><p>ORCHARDS AND BEATING AN UNARMED MAN AS THEY TOOK </p><p>HIM AWAY FOR QUESTIONING.  THE TWO HOUSES IN WHICH </p><p>QAFISHA REPORTEDLY HID--OWNED BY THE FAMILIES OF </p><p>UTHMAN AL-FALAH AND MUHAMMAD DANHASH--WERE HIT WITH </p><p>MISSILES AND THEN BULLDOZED.  THE FAMILY MEMBERS </p><p>WERE REPORTEDLY EVICTED WEARING ONLY THEIR NIGHT </p><p>CLOTHES AND WERE FORBIDDEN TO TAKE ANYTHING WITH </p><p>THEM.  A STABLE FILLED WITH SHEEP BELONGING TO THE </p><p>DANHASH FAMILY WAS ALSO HIT WITH MISSILES AND THEN </p><p>BULLDOZED, AND A NEARBY GROVE OF ABOUT 100 GRAPE </p><p>VINES WERE PLOWED UNDER. </p><p> </p><p>5.  ACCORDING TO PRESS, THE HEBRON AREA COMMANDER </p><p>SAID DESTROYING THE HOMES AND TREES WAS STANDARD </p><p>PRACTICE BECAUSE THE TROOPS SUSPECTED MORE GUNMEN </p><p>COULD BE HIDING THERE.  THE FALAH AND DANHASH </p><p>FAMILIES REJECTED THAT, SAYING THEIR HOMES WERE NOT </p><p>HIT WITH MISSILES UNTIL QAFISHA WAS CONFIRMED TO BE </p><p>DEAD AND HIS BODY WAS TAKEN AWAY.  THEY TOLD ARAB </p><p>JOURNALISTS THAT QAFISHA WAS NEVER IN THEIR HOMES </p><p>BUT WAS INSTEAD SLEEPING IN THE VINEYARD. </p><p>ACCORDING TO UNRWA SOURCES JUNE 30, HEBRON IS STILL </p><p>CLOSED AND UNDER CURFEW. </p><p> </p><p>6.  IDF SOURCES TOLD THE PRESS THAT QAFISHA WAS THE </p><p>LAST KNOWN REMAINING MEMBER OF A HEBRON MAMAS CELL </p><p>THAT WAS ALLEGEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF AT </p><p>LEAST SIX ISRAELIS IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS IN HEBRON </p><p>OVER THE PAST YEAR AS WELL AS THE WOUNDING OF </p><p>SEVERAL SOLDIERS IN SHOOTING ATTACKS ON VEHICLES </p><p>AND THE ATTEMPTED KIDNAPPING OF A SETTLER.  THE </p><p>FOUR OTHER KNOWN CELL MEMBERS WERE TRACKED DOWN AND </p><p>KILLED IN TWO SEPARATE OPERATIONS BY UNDERCOVER </p><p>ISRAELI SECURITY UNITS OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS </p><p>(REFTELS B, C AND D).  ACCORDING TO PRESS, MILITARY </p><p>SOURCES ESTIMATE TWO OTHER MAMAS CELLS WITH A TOTAL </p><p>OF FIVE MEMBERS ARE STILL AT LARGE IN HEBRON. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT.  THE IDF OPERATION, ESPECIALLY THE </p><p>DEMOLITION OF TWO HOMES, HAS CREATED ANGER IN </p><p>HEBRON WHERE THE POPULATION IS ALREADY CRITICAL OF </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS AND SEES LITTLE CHANCE FOR ANY </p><p>IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR SITUATION IN THE NEAR TERM. </p><p>ALTHOUGH UNDERCOVER KILLINGS OF THE OTHER MEMBERS </p><p>OF THIS CELL DID NOT PROVOKE A RETALIATORY ATTACK </p><p>BY MAMAS MEMBERS--PROBABLY AS A RESULT OF HEAVY </p><p>PRESSURE FROM THE PA TO STOP ATTACKS AND PUBLIC </p><p>AVERSION TO SUCH ATTACKS--ONE CAN NOT RULE OUT A </p><p>RETALIATORY ATTACK AGAINST ISRAELIS AT THIS </p><p>CRITICAL TIME, ON THE EVE OF WHAT MANY PALESTINIANS </p><p>CONSIDER TO BE A DEADLINE, NOT A TARGET DATE, FOR A </p><p>REDEPLOYMENT AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT CONTINUED.  ALTHOUGH THE IDF CLAIMED </p><p>THAT QAFISHA REFUSED TO SURRENDER--AND HE HAS </p><p>CLEARLY ARMED AND APPARENTLY SHOT A </p><p>SOLDIER--ISRAELI UNDERCOVER UNITS ON OPERATIONS TO </p><p>FIND WANTED MEN HAVE GENERALLY MADE LITTLE ATTEMPT </p><p>TO ARREST OR BRING TO TRIAL THEIR TARGETS.  THE </p><p>FOUR OTHER ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THIS MAMAS CELL, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, WERE ALL KILLED ON SITE EVEN THOUGH SOME </p><p>WERE UNARMED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ABINGTON </p><p></p></div>
