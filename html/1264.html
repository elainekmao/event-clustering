(C) ON AUGUST 23 AMBASSADOR AND ECONOFF MET WITH CARL </p><p>PETERSON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, GERALD METALS INC., (A </p><p>STAMFORD CONNECTICUT-BASED PRECIOUS METALS DEALER AND </p><p>MERCHANT BANK) TO DISCUSS CONDITIONS IN ZIMBABWE, THE </p><p>STATUS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT, AND </p><p>TO LEARN MORE OF GERALD METALS\' DEALINGS AND RELATIONSHIP </p><p>WITH ZIMBABWE\'S RESERVE BANK.  THE MEETING WAS THE FIRST </p><p>TIME WE HAD HEARD OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO, AND </p><p>THIS MESSAGE PROVIDES DETAILS ON THE JOINT HISTORY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) ACCORDING TO PETERSON THE RELATIONSHIP BEGAN WHEN </p><p>THE RESERVE BANK CHOSE GERALD METALS TO PROVIDE PRE-EXPORT </p><p>FINANCING OF GOLD SALES IN 1984 WHEN ZIMBABWE HAD A NEED </p><p>FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY CAUSED BY DROUGHT CONDITIONS.  IN </p><p>1988, THE U.S. FIRM HELPED THE RESERVE BANK SETUP A GOLD </p><p>JEWELRY MANUFACTURING FACILITY TO BOOST THE REVENUE </p><p>RECEIVED FROM GOLD SALES.  AT ITS PEAK, WE WERE TOLD, THE </p><p>PLANT EMPLOYED 2,000, THOUGH THAT IS NOW DOWN TO ABOUT </p><p>1,200.  LAST YEAR THE WORKSHOP PRODUCED ABOUT 70,000 </p><p>OUNCES OF GOLD JEWELRY (ALL SOLD IN THE U.S. MARKET), OR </p><p>ABOUT 8 PERCENT OF 1999 GOLD PRODUCTION.  THE BUSINESSMAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04821  301431Z </p><p>TOLD US THAT THEIR INTRODUCTION OF AN ISRAELI MANAGER WHO </p><p>OVERSAW STARTUP AND PRODUCTION FOR THE FIRST EIGHT YEARS </p><p>OF THE JEWELRY OPERATION WAS THE IMPETUS BEHIND THE </p><p>OPENING OF AN ISRAELI EMBASSY HERE ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO. </p><p>WHEN WE POINTED OUT THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST WE HAD HEARD </p><p>OF SUCH AN OPERATION, HE EXPLAINED THAT THE RESERVE BANK </p><p>WAS VERY PROTECTIVE AND SECRETIVE ABOUT IT, AS THEY </p><p>REALIZED THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE OPERATION WOULD BRING </p><p>ATTENTION, AND LIKELY, DEMANDS FOR A PIECE OF THE ACTION. </p><p>REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP IN GENERAL BETWEEN GERALD </p><p>METALS AND THE RESERVE BANK PETERSON NOTED THAT, "I HAVE </p><p>ALWAYS FOUND THE RESERVE BANK TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY HONEST </p><p>AND TRUSTWORTHY, AND THEY HAVE ALWAYS PAID AND HONORED </p><p>THEIR COMMITMENTS COMPLETELY AND ON TIME."  HE POINTED TO </p><p>THE EARLY PAYBACK OF A 12 MONTH USD 150 MILLION FACILITY </p><p>AS EVIDENCE OF THIS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) DESCRIBING THIS TRANSACTION, PETERSON TOLD US THAT </p><p>IT WAS GERALD METALS THAT ARRANGED THE USD 150 MILLION </p><p>FORWARD GOLD SALE IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR (HE TERMED IT PRE- </p><p>EXPORT FINANCING), AND EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS A 12 MONTH </p><p>CREDIT, IT HAD ALL BEEN PAID BACK BY LAST MONTH.   HE WAS </p><p>UNWILLING TO SHARE DETAILS ON WHY THIS OCCURRED, GIVEN </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S DIRE NEED FOR HARD CURRENCY, STATING ONLY THAT </p><p>DELIVERY OF BULLION TO NEW YORK HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO PAY </p><p>OFF THE LOAN.  HE WAS ALSO UNWILLING TO PROVIDE DETAILS OF </p><p>THE CREDIT, SUCH AS THE INTEREST RATE AND PARTICIPANTS, </p><p>SAYING ONLY THAT A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN AND ONE JAPANESE </p><p>BANK HAD PARTICIPATED IN THE LENDING SYNDICATE.  HE DID </p><p>TELL US THAT ALL OF THESE BANKS HAD RECENTLY EXPRESSED NO </p><p>INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING IN ANY NEW ZIMBABWE CREDITS AT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04821  301431Z </p><p>THIS TIME. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) PETERSON SAID THAT HIS FIRM\'S LATEST TRANSACTION </p><p>WAS A $10 MILLION PRE-EXPORT LINE OF CREDIT TO BE USED BY </p><p>THE RESERVE BANK TO FUND THE FOREIGN CURRENCY ACCOUNTS NOW </p><p>ABLE TO BE HELD BY GOLD PRODUCERS (REFTEL).  HE STATED </p><p>THAT THE RESERVE BANK WOULD LIKE THIS INCREASED IN OCTOBER </p><p>OR NOVEMBER BY ANOTHER USD 10 TO 15 MILLION, BUT TO DO SO </p><p>HE WOULD NEED THE PARTICIPATION OF COMMERCIAL BANKS.  "WE </p><p>HANDLED THE $10 MILLION OURSELVES", HE STATED, "BUT THAT\'S </p><p>ABOUT AS BIG AS WE, AS A PRIVATE COMPANY, CAN GO." ECONOFF </p><p>SHARED OUR VIEW OF THE VERY SERIOUS BALANCE OF PAYMENTS </p><p>SITUATION FACING ZIMBABWE, AND HE ADMITTED THAT NEW CREDIT </p><p>EXTENSION BY COMMERCIAL BANKS WOULD GROW MORE DIFFICULT IF </p><p>NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO SECURE AS THE YEAR WORE ON. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, HE WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE EXCELLENT, AND </p><p>PROFITABLE, WORKING RELATIONSHIP GERALD METALS HAD </p><p>DEVELOPED WITH THE RESERVE BANK.  IN CLOSING WE OFFERED </p><p>OUR ASSISTANCE GOING FORWARD, AND OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE </p><p>INFORMATION PETERSON SHARED WITH US. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
