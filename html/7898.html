<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ADANA 0132 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          MAY 7, 2003 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary </p><p>for May 7, 2003.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy </p><p>of the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  Cumhuriyet: Turkish President Ahmet Necdet </p><p>Sezer\'s visit to Bingol with the Head of TGS, </p><p>Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, caused a protocol crisis. </p><p>Bingol\'s DEHAP Mayor, Feyzullah Karaaslan, went </p><p>to the 49th Domestic Security Brigade Command to </p><p>welcome the president on behalf of the people of </p><p>Bingol, but was denied access to the military </p><p>compound.  Bingol\'s Governor, Huseyin Avni Cos, </p><p>seeing that the mayor was denied entry to the </p><p>military compound, did not intervene in the case. </p><p>After Mayor Karaaslan returned to his tent in the </p><p>park to continue his activities, he received a </p><p>call from a captain saying there had been a </p><p>misunderstanding and invited him back to the </p><p>Brigade Command, but Mayor Karaaslan refused to </p><p>go. Mayor Karaaslan said he would not go to the </p><p>place he had been dismissed from. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Cumhuriyet/Evrensel/Milliyet: Bingol\'s DEHAP </p><p>Mayor, Feyzullah Karaaslan, complained that all </p><p>the humanitarian relief items sent to the </p><p>municipality following the earthquake were seized </p><p>by the governor\'s office.  Mayor Karaaslan said </p><p>the municipality tried to cooperate with all </p><p>government agencies in town from the very </p><p>beginning of the earthquake, but because of the </p><p>governor\'s efforts to render the municipality </p><p>ineffective, the municipality decided to withdraw </p><p>from the "Crisis Table" headed by the governor. </p><p>He stated that the needy people did not get the </p><p>relief items, adding the "Crisis Table" seized </p><p>all the relief assistance coming to the town and </p><p>stored them in military facilities, a gymnasium, </p><p>and in an orphanage.  He also claimed the Crisis </p><p>Table was prevented from receiving humanitarian </p><p>assistance sent by other municipalities in the </p><p>region. In addition, Karaaslan said that rather </p><p>than supplying the needs of the people, the </p><p>Crisis Organization Center and its officials </p><p>drove their cars and APCs against the people, and </p><p>responded with gunfire by Special Operation </p><p>Teams.  He further claimed yesterday police </p><p>seized food and shelter materials sent by </p><p>Kigi/Yayladare Assistance and Solidarity </p><p>Association. The police, taking the relief </p><p>materials to the Security Directorate, denied the </p><p>request of association officials for the delivery </p><p>of the material. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  Cumhuriyet: 800 students boarding at Kozluk </p><p>Regional Boarding School in Batman are being </p><p>evacuated from the school because of the cracks </p><p>formed in the building after the earthquake in </p><p>Bingol. It has been determined that already part </p><p>of the school slid. The school was built on a </p><p>salt rock foundation four years ago. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  Milliyet: Hamdiye Aslan, a woman arrested and </p><p>allegedly tortured by police in Kiziltepe of </p><p>Mardin on the charges of assisting and harboring </p><p>the PKK, claimed she recognized the policewoman </p><p>who had maltreated her, Hanife Sennur Pat, and </p><p>sued.  Police said Aslan rolled herself on the </p><p>ground and traces were left on her body when they </p><p>grabbed her by the arm to lift her from the </p><p>ground.  Aslan claimed she was tortured </p><p>constantly while under detention, but could not </p><p>see the faces of the male police officers because </p><p>of black plastic bags put on her head.  She said </p><p>four to five policemen beat her all the time, and </p><p>she tried to remove the plastic bag when she was </p><p>out of breath. Aslan said it was at that time </p><p>that she saw the policewoman who tortured her. </p><p>The court adjourned the hearing to an unspecified </p><p>date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  Bolge:  The following four members of the DYP </p><p>party resigned from their positions yesterday: </p><p>1) DYP\'s Adana Provincial Chairman, Yavuz Tekeli; </p><p>2) the chairman for Yuregir District; 3) the </p><p>chairman of Seyhan District; 4) the chairman of </p><p>Kozan District; and 5) the chair of the Youth and </p><p>Women Organization of the party.  Tekeli was </p><p>elected to the office at DYP\'s Adana Provincial </p><p>Convention on June 22, 2002. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  Milli Gazete: Approximately eight thousand </p><p>students left school before the completion of the </p><p>academic year in Siverek township of Sanliurfa in </p><p>order to work as seasonal- farm-workers for six </p><p>months with their families during the harvesting </p><p>period. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
