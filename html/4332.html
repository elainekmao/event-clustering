<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 KATHMANDU 002168 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AIDAC </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR G/TIP-SALLY NEUMANN AND SA/RA-DENISE MARSH; </p><p>USAID FOR ANE-LYNN SAULS AND EGAT-K. BLAKESLEE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, PHUM, SMIG, PREL, ELAB, EAID, KSEP, ASEC, KPAO, SNAR, NP, Trafficking in Persons </p><p>SUBJECT: U.S. GOVERNMENT ANTI-TRAFFICKING STRATEGY FOR </p><p>NEPAL </p><p> </p><p>REF.: STATE 219965 </p><p> </p><p>1.   Post hereby submits its anti-trafficking strategy as </p><p>requested reftel.  This document provides information on </p><p>both ongoing and proposed programs and some results to </p><p>date. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Background of Situation </p><p> </p><p>Nepal is a source country for trafficking of children and </p><p>women mainly to India. Internal Trafficking is on the </p><p>rise. Trafficking has been largely for prostitution, </p><p>domestic and other forms of exploitative labor, and in a </p><p>few cases for organ transplants. </p><p> </p><p>Estimates on the extent and magnitude of Nepal\'s problem </p><p>of trafficking vary from source to source.  A study done </p><p>by the International Labor Organization/International </p><p>Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (ILO/IPEC) in </p><p>2001 estimates the number of trafficking victims to be </p><p>12,000 per year in contrast to the 5,000-7,000 quoted in </p><p>earlier publications. The Ministry of Women, Children and </p><p>Social Welfare (MWCSW) has identified twenty-six of </p><p>Nepal\'s seventy-five districts as trafficking-prone. </p><p>Those at highest risk of being trafficked are from the </p><p>hill ethnic groups and lower castes, but members of </p><p>higher castes have also been trafficked. As awareness and </p><p>surveillance activities in former source districts have </p><p>made trafficking from them more difficult, a geographic </p><p>shift in the activities of traffickers has been observed. </p><p>Girls as young as nine years old have been trafficked. An </p><p>increase in cross-border trafficking of boys for </p><p>exploitative labor has recently been discovered. </p><p> </p><p>A recent study by Nepal\'s Integrated Institute for </p><p>Development Studies (IIDS) has identified forty-six NGOs </p><p>and twenty INGOs and Donors working in the area of </p><p>trafficking in and outside Kathmandu. Few organizations </p><p>provide rehabilitation services. Maiti Nepal has a Child </p><p>Protection and Women Rehabilitation Home in Kathmandu, </p><p>Hospices in Kakarbhitta and Jhapa, nine transit homes in </p><p>the five development regions of Nepal, and three </p><p>prevention homes in the central region. ABC Nepal runs </p><p>four transit homes in Janakpur (1), Biratnagar (1) and </p><p>Kathmandu (2). WOREC has a transit home in Dhanusha and </p><p>community safe houses in Udaipur. A Skill Training Center </p><p>is operated by MWCSW for the at risk groups. </p><p> </p><p>Three networks actively working against trafficking are </p><p>the National Network Against Girl Trafficking (NNAGT), </p><p>Alliance Against Trafficking of Women in Nepal (AATWIN) </p><p>and Network against Trafficking of Women and Children in </p><p>Nepal (NATWC). </p><p> </p><p>3.   U.S. Government\'s Response </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government began to assist anti-trafficking </p><p>efforts in Nepal in 1997.  Programs supported have been </p><p>in the areas of Prevention, Protection and Prosecution. </p><p>U.S. Government Agencies supporting anti-trafficking </p><p>activities in Nepal are the U.S. Embassy Political </p><p>Section and Public Diplomacy Office, Peace Corps, </p><p>Department of Defense, Department of Labor, State </p><p>Department and U.S. Agency for International Development </p><p>(USAID). A Mission Anti-Trafficking Committee has been </p><p>established to coordinate initiatives and to prepare the </p><p>annual Trafficking in Persons Report. In addition, USAID </p><p>has a South Asia Regional Program being implemented by </p><p>the United Nations Fund for Women (UNIFEM). The program </p><p>implementing organizations (U.S. funded) are </p><p>International Labor Organization, World Education, Center </p><p>for Population and Development Activities (CEDPA), The </p><p>Asia Foundation (TAF), UNICEF and Nepali non-governmental </p><p>organizations. The U.S. Department of Labor, USAID and </p><p>he State Department fund these programs. The Mission </p><p>Anti-Trafficking Committee has developed the following </p><p>strategy to guide our efforts based on the three themes </p><p>of Prevention, Protection and Prosecution and is closely </p><p>integrated with the development assistance programs in </p><p>the area of democracy, governance and health.  This </p><p>strategy includes both bilateral and regional activities. </p><p> </p><p>4.   Program Area: Prevention </p><p> </p><p>Target audiences: The target audiences for prevention </p><p>programs are vulnerable women and children, government </p><p>anti-trafficking task force members, police, immigration </p><p>and law enforcement agencies, courts, influential </p><p>community groups, transport workers, elected women </p><p>leaders, students, teachers and adolescent girls. </p><p> </p><p>The Mission\'s strategy places primary emphasis on </p><p>prevention. Priority activities under the prevention </p><p>program are increasing awareness of trafficking by target </p><p>groups and providing skill training to vulnerable groups </p><p>to make meaningful alternative life choices; training NGO </p><p>workers, community groups and police; conducting literacy </p><p>programs for out of school girls; researching and </p><p>studying migration policies; developing Information </p><p>Education Communication (IEC) messages and a national </p><p>communication strategy; establishing a Documentation </p><p>Information Communication (DIC) system; publishing </p><p>newsletters; strengthening advocacy and co-ordination </p><p>capacity of NGO network and improving the capacity of </p><p>district, municipality and village task forces to combat </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Ongoing or Recently Completed Activities </p><p> </p><p>Awareness raising and information dissemination: The Asia </p><p>Foundation (TAF) with current USAID assistance (2001- </p><p>2004) under its Democracy and Governance program is </p><p>conducting awareness activities in five districts </p><p>(Dhading, Nawalparasi, Banke, Chitwan and Dhanusha) </p><p>identified by the Ministry of Women Children and Social </p><p>Welfare (MWCSW) as trafficking prone districts. TAF\'s </p><p>local district partners are The Women Rehabilitation </p><p>Center (WOREC), Center for Legal Research and Resource </p><p>Documentation (CeLRRD), Center for Victims of Torture </p><p>(CVICT), Agro-forestry, Basic Health and Cooperatives, </p><p>Nepal (ABC Nepal), Maiti Nepal, Forum for Women, Law and </p><p>Development (FWLD), National Network against Girl </p><p>trafficking (NNAGT) and NGO Federation. NGO Federation </p><p>and TAF are facilitating meetings with district, </p><p>municipality and village level task forces that have </p><p>cross-sectoral composition for co-ordination to combat </p><p>trafficking. UNIFEM is working with various local </p><p>organizations to raise awareness. ILO/IPEC works through </p><p>\'Vigilant Groups\' at the community level in the bordering </p><p>districts of Parsa, Jhapa, Rupandehi and Banke to raise </p><p>awareness and share information on the content of ILO </p><p>Convention 182, Child Rights Convention (CRC) and other </p><p>trafficking related issues. Information regarding policy </p><p>issues is shared at the District Development Committee </p><p>level. </p><p> </p><p>To educate Nepal\'s semi-literate audience, a comic book </p><p>\'Our Decision, Our Protection\' was published under the </p><p>Frights, Responsibility and Advocacy\' component of </p><p>USAID\'s Women\'s Empowerment Program in April 2000. </p><p>200,000 copies of the book were distributed in the </p><p>seventy-five districts of the country. </p><p> </p><p>The Public Diplomacy Office under the International </p><p>Visitor Program sponsors exposure visits of NGO and Govt. </p><p>professionals working on anti-trafficking issues to the </p><p>U.S., and invites speakers from the U.S. to provide </p><p>orientation to their Nepali counterparts on policies and </p><p>regulations adopted by the U.S. Government. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Research and Study: Nepal\'s Institute for Integrated </p><p>Development Studies (IIDS) has conducted a study entitled </p><p>\'Status and Dimension of Trafficking within Nepal\' with </p><p>UNIFEM support under the South Asia Regional Initiative </p><p>for Gender Equity (SARI/Equity) program in 2002. Under </p><p>the TAF supported activity, CeLRRD has completed a </p><p>baseline survey in five districts to assess the situati </p><p>on </p><p>of trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>Research and studies for better understanding the problem </p><p>of trafficking have been conducted by ILO/IPEC in 2000- </p><p>01. The four studies are entitled 1. Trafficking in Girls </p><p>with Special Reference to Prostitution: A Rapid </p><p>assessment, 2. Trafficking and Sexual Abuse among Street </p><p>Children in Kathmandu, 3. Cross Border Trafficking of </p><p>Boys and 4. Internal Trafficking among Children Engaged </p><p>in Prostitution. </p><p> </p><p>7.   Development of IEC Messages and National IEC </p><p>Strategy: CEDPA has prepared a compendium of IEC </p><p>materials. From the review of the materials, a list of </p><p>messages and associated behaviors have been drafted that </p><p>will form the basis for developing the National IEC </p><p>Strategy. Establishment of a Documentation Information </p><p>Center (DIC) within the ministry to collect and </p><p>disseminate information on trafficking has enhanced the </p><p>capacity of Ministry of Women Children and Social Welfare </p><p>(MWCSW). The aspect of information collection and </p><p>documentation has been strong but the present situation </p><p>of security has resulted in weak dissemination of </p><p>information, as the DIC is not easily accessible. </p><p> </p><p>8.   Publication of Newsletter: With the objective of </p><p>raising awareness on various topics, four volumes of the </p><p>\'Combat\' newsletter have been published by </p><p>MWCSW/ILO/CEDPA since 2000, two more volumes will be </p><p>published within 2002. The focus topics of the newsletter </p><p>are health, education, legislation and enforcement, </p><p>income generation, and employment generation and </p><p>promoting anti trafficking behaviors. Similarly NNAGT </p><p>publishes a regular newsletter to disseminate information </p><p>related to trafficking activities. </p><p> </p><p>9.   Training and Capacity Building: Under the current </p><p>TAF program, specific training is being provided to </p><p>selected target groups. WOREC provided rights based </p><p>training to senior level staff and community level </p><p>trainers of partner organizations to improve knowledge </p><p>within communities and among government personnel of the </p><p>problem of trafficking in their respective districts. A </p><p>training manual on \'Safe Migration Alternatives\' was </p><p>prepared in consultation with Ministry of Labor and </p><p>Transportation (Molt) and overseas employment agencies. </p><p>Training is being provided to partner organizations using </p><p>this manual to enable them to deal/orient potential </p><p>migrants on issues related to safe migration. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Strengthening Advocacy and Co-ordination Capacity of </p><p>NGO Networks: Training and orientation provided regularly </p><p>by NNAGT is strengthening advocacy and co-ordination </p><p>capacity of the NGO networks and its members to combat </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>In June 2000, UNIFEM initiated the formation of the South </p><p>Asia Forum against Human Trafficking (SAFAHT) to </p><p>strengthen the regional network. The second regional </p><p>meeting of SAFAHT was conducted in May 2001. </p><p> </p><p>11.  Improving the Capacity of District, Municipality and </p><p>Village Task Forces: Nepal\'s District, Municipality and </p><p>Village Task Forces (DTF, MTF, VTF) are being </p><p>strengthened for cross-sectoral co-ordination to combat </p><p>trafficking by implementing/enforcing the existing </p><p>National Plan of Action. ILO/IPEC is working with the </p><p>DTF, MTF and VTFs in four districts, Jhapa, Parsa, </p><p>Rupandehi and Banke and TAF in the selected five </p><p>districts. </p><p> </p><p>12.  Literacy Programs: World Education initiated the </p><p>Girls Access to Education (GATE) program (2001-2002) to </p><p>prevent trafficking by educating "out of school" </p><p>adolescent girls and preparing them for the challenges of </p><p>womanhood. 7,500 "out of school" girls from seven </p><p>districts were the target audience of this program. An </p><p>impact evaluation of the GATE program in the first year </p><p>showed a considerably high percentage of increase in </p><p>knowledge amongst the girls regarding trafficking and </p><p>about preventive measures. USAID/Nepal has extended </p><p>support to GATE activity for another year through SO2 </p><p>Health Program. </p><p> </p><p>World Education, through its current \'Brighter Future </p><p>Program\' aims to provide literacy to 17,000 children in </p><p>the ag  group of 10-14 who are engaged in the \'worst form </p><p>of child labor\' and 65,000 \'children at risk\' in twenty- </p><p>two districts of Nepal over a period of four years (2002- </p><p>2006). World Education will be working in the same </p><p>districts as ILO/IPEC for their Time Bound Program (2000- </p><p>2005)to eliminate child labor. Trafficking is one of the </p><p>focus areas of this program. ILO/IPEC initiated provision </p><p>of non-formal and formal education in 45 Village </p><p>Development Committees (VDCs) of three districts, which </p><p>are Chitwan, Makwanpur and Nawalparasi. The target </p><p>audience for the awareness program through education is </p><p>4,500 school children and equal number of adults. </p><p> </p><p>13.  Budget </p><p> </p><p>Approximately US DOLS 1,233,816 has been obligated for </p><p>the prevention programs by USAID/Nepal and Washington. </p><p>UNIFEM is funded under the South Asia Regional Initiative </p><p>for Gender Equality (SARI/Q) programs of USAID and has a </p><p>funding for approximately US DOLS 3.1 million for the </p><p>whole region. World Education has been granted US DOLS </p><p>4,000,000 in 2002 by Department of Labor for expanding </p><p>literacy and other skill development programs for </p><p>occupational reintegration. ILO/IPEC has been granted US </p><p>DOLS 5,000,000 in 2002 by Department of Labor to </p><p>implement the Time Bound Program. </p><p> </p><p>14.  Proposed Activities </p><p>Some of the proposed activities for prevention are </p><p>continuation of awareness programs on trafficking and </p><p>safe migration, setting up information booths for migrant </p><p>workers, setting up micro-enterprise activities for </p><p>meaningful employment opportunities for at risk groups, a </p><p>regional study on demand and supply for trafficking, and </p><p>support to strengthen the Government\'s Village and </p><p>District Task forces. Estimated cost for these programs </p><p>is DOLS 1,002,000.  ILO/IPEC will replicate the ongoing </p><p>activities in four cluster districts of the eastern </p><p>region in the near future. </p><p> </p><p>15.  Indicators for Program Monitoring </p><p> </p><p>-    Mechanisms for cooperation on anti trafficking </p><p>activities between government and NGOs established and </p><p>operational. </p><p>-    Sustainable NGO networks working against </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>-    Increased anti-trafficking advocacy and services by </p><p>organizations and networks already mobilized around other </p><p>women\'s and children\'s issues. </p><p> </p><p>-    Increased knowledge of trafficking and preventive </p><p>measures by target groups. </p><p> </p><p>16.  Program Area: Protection (Rescue/Rehabilitation) </p><p> </p><p>Target audiences: The target audiences for protection </p><p>(rescue/ rehabilitation) are victims of trafficking, some </p><p>at risk girls and women, police, and NGOs assisting </p><p>victims. </p><p> </p><p>Priority and funded activities for protection are </p><p>sensitization programs for service providers and law </p><p>enforcing government agencies, support to transit homes, </p><p>research-study on best practices for alternative </p><p>livelihood strategies and training for gainful employment </p><p>opportunities. </p><p> </p><p>17.  Ongoing or Recently Completed Activities </p><p> </p><p>Sensitization Program: UNIFEM and UNICEF sensitize police </p><p>at border crossings in handling rescued/repatriated </p><p>victims. US Embassy/State and the Immigration and </p><p>Naturalization Service (INS) conducts anti-fraud training </p><p>for immigration and customs officers. The last training </p><p>was conducted in 2001 and included a presentation on </p><p>trafficking by ABC Nepal. Other governmental officials, </p><p>NGO representatives and third-country Embassy personnel </p><p>also attended. NGOs and community groups have been </p><p>sensitized to the issues of HIV/AIDS and its relation to </p><p>trafficking and the need to rehabilitate returnees of </p><p>trafficking under USAID/Nepal\'s Health program. </p><p> </p><p>18.  Training: CVICT has provided training to strengthen </p><p>the capacity of NGOs providing rehabilitation and </p><p>counseling for trafficking victims, abused women and </p><p>children, and at risk groups. CVICT has also assisted </p><p>partner organizations to set up a case study </p><p>documentation system and establish local referral </p><p>practices. UNICEF is supporting training of the police </p><p>for investigative crime scene management. ILO/IPEC </p><p>sup </p><p>ported developing the curriculum for the counseling </p><p>training and is coordinating efforts to take this manual </p><p>to the regional level. ILO/IPEC will build capacity of </p><p>NGOs to promote national standardized guidelines on </p><p>childcare facilities. </p><p> </p><p>19.  Research-study: WOREC/TAF are conducting a study on </p><p>best practices for alternative livelihood strategies. </p><p>UNIFEM/Sarthak carried out a need assessment study to </p><p>review the existing status of socio-psycho counseling </p><p>expertise in Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>20.  Gainful Employment Opportunities: UNIFEM has </p><p>supported \'Shakti Samuha\' (a group of fifteen returned </p><p>victims) with occupational reintegration by assisting in </p><p>the establishment of a photocopier business center. </p><p>Three members of  \'Shakti Samuha\' are undergoing skill </p><p>training to handle the business efficiently.  Maiti Nepal </p><p>and TAF are working for an effective scheme for job </p><p>placement of returnees. World Education under the </p><p>\'Brighter Future Program\' will have a component on </p><p>occupational reintegration.  ILO/IPEC will provide </p><p>proffessionalised training to the affected group for </p><p>occupational reintegration. </p><p> </p><p>21.  Transit homes: ILO/IPEC has supported Maiti Nepal to </p><p>establish transit homes in Kakarbhitta and Bhairahawa. </p><p>UNIFEM has supported ABC Nepal to establish a transit </p><p>home in Delhi. International Organization on Migration </p><p>(IOM) has supported ABC Nepal and WOREC to establish </p><p>transit homes in Kathmandu and Dhanusha.  Besides these </p><p>organizations \'Karuna Bhawan\' and \'Shanti Rehabilitation </p><p>Center\' also assist the returnees. </p><p> </p><p>22.  Budget </p><p> </p><p>Approximately US DOLS 112,000 has been obligated for the </p><p>ongoing programs by USG funded UNIFEM program. </p><p> </p><p>23.  Proposed Activities </p><p> </p><p>Proposed protection activities (rescue/rehabilitation) </p><p>are continuation of the sensitization program, operating </p><p>the counseling program, and enhancing the capability of </p><p>the rescued girls for meaningful employment through </p><p>occupational training and job placement. Estimated cost </p><p>for the proposed programs is US DOLS 350,000. </p><p> </p><p>24.  Indicators </p><p> </p><p>-    Innovative rehabilitation and reintegration </p><p>strategies ready for replication </p><p> </p><p>-    More and higher counseling services available to </p><p>trafficking survivors </p><p> </p><p>-    Increased employment options for trafficking </p><p>survivors </p><p> </p><p>25.  Program area: Prosecution </p><p> </p><p>Target audiences: The target audiences for prosecution </p><p>are law enforcement agencies. </p><p> </p><p>Priority funded activities under prosecution are </p><p>technical assistance and advocacy for adoption of a new </p><p>anti-trafficking law, improved enforcement of legislation </p><p>and creation of missing persons\' components in the Nepal </p><p>National Police information and criminal investigation </p><p>system. The other activities are sharing information with </p><p>destination country police, prosecutors\' workshop on case </p><p>management and successful prosecution, improvement of </p><p>court procedures to protect victims. </p><p> </p><p>26.  Ongoing Activities </p><p> </p><p>Advocacy for Adoption of New Anti-Trafficking Law: TAF </p><p>and UNIFEM/FWLD reviewed the existing anti-trafficking </p><p>law, provided recommendations for amendment and advocated </p><p>and lobbied for the passage of the new anti-trafficking </p><p>law. The Lower House of Parliament passed the bill </p><p>introduced by the MWCSW in the Twenty First Parliamentary </p><p>Session. </p><p> </p><p>27.  Improved Enforcement of Laws: UNICEF supports </p><p>training for basic investigative and crime scene </p><p>management techniques for prosecutors and judges, </p><p>prosecutor\'s workshop on case management and successful </p><p>prosecution, and improvement of court procedures to </p><p>protect victims. UNIFEM supports initiatives to share </p><p>information with destination country police. </p><p> </p><p>28.  Missing Person\'s Inventory: A missing person\'s </p><p>inventory is being created by the Nepal National Police </p><p>Information and Criminal Investigation system with UNICEF </p><p>support. </p><p> </p><p>29.  Budget </p><p>Approximately US DOLS 75,000 has been obligated for the </p><p>ongoing activities by INL/UNIFEM. </p><p> </p><p>30.  Proposed Activities </p><p> </p><p>Proposed activities for effective pr </p><p>osecution are </p><p>training on new legislation for effective enforcement, </p><p>establishment of improved court structures for protection </p><p>of the victims and strengthening the capacity of women </p><p>cells of police and training at border crossings. The </p><p>estimated cost of approximately US DOLS 220,000 for the </p><p>proposed programs has been provided by INL.  UNICEF has </p><p>been contacted regarding implementation of the program. </p><p> </p><p>31.  Indicators </p><p> </p><p>-    Legal framework that better protects the rights of </p><p>women and girls </p><p> </p><p>-    Increase in the number of traffickers arrested </p><p> </p><p>-    Increase in the number of traffickers convicted </p><p> </p><p>32.  Conclusion </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Government Agencies in Nepal are highly committed to </p><p>the prevention of trafficking and protection of its </p><p>victims. Comprehensive programs have been initiated to </p><p>reduce vulnerability of women and children from being </p><p>trafficked by raising awareness, increasing </p><p>literacy/educational level and providing skill training </p><p>for occupational reintegration. Counseling capacity has </p><p>been improved through training and best rehabilitation </p><p>practices are being replicated for the protection of </p><p>victims. Legal bodies, Government task forces at </p><p>different levels, and law enforcing agencies are being </p><p>trained/oriented for proper enforcement of laws and </p><p>policies and to take necessary actions against the </p><p>traffickers. Similarly, existing laws and policies are </p><p>being reviewed for necessary amendments. </p><p> </p><p>However, minimum coordination amongst supporting agencies </p><p>and lack of unity among NGOs is an obstacle to achieving </p><p>desired result. Lack of comprehensive baseline study is </p><p>another hindrance to measuring the success of activities </p><p>implemented. Other factors that provide a nurturing </p><p>ground to trafficking of women and children in Nepal are </p><p>weak law enforcement system and high level of corruption </p><p>among law enforcement bodies. A lack of political will to </p><p>place the issue in the national priority agenda, the open </p><p>border with India and the need for a study regarding the </p><p>demand (India) and supply (Nepal, Bangladesh) aspects of </p><p>the problem are other dimensions to the issue. The </p><p>holistic approach and programs supported by the USG in </p><p>Nepal and the region are expected to address these gaps. </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
