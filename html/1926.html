<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002179 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/31/2011 </p><p>TAGS: NI, PHUM, PREL </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: U.S. PRESENCE AT DURBAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 151077 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Timothy D. Andrews.  Reason:  1.5(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) DCM delivered reftel points to MFA Permanent </p><p>Secretary Ambassador T.D. Hart shortly before 0700 EDT on </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Friday, August 31.  Hart was aware that the Secretary would </p><p>not attend; he had seen the Secretary on CNN earlier.  Hart </p><p>regretted that the U.S. might not participate at all and </p><p>offered that Nigeria hoped circumstances would change such </p><p>that U.S. attendance would be assured.  Hart said he would </p><p>travel to Durban "to look in" on the WCAR and then return to </p><p>Nigeria late in the week.  President Obasanjo was already in </p><p>southern Africa and would attend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Nigeria was displeased, Hart continued, that no </p><p>agreement could be reached on the Middle East language. </p><p>"There is a sense in which (this language) removes focus and </p><p>attention from the purpose (of the WCAR)," Hart added, </p><p>emphasizing, "We did our best to restrain the Palestinians, </p><p>...but some people will use any forum to press the points </p><p>near and dear to their hearts." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Hart said Nigeria would use the margins to continue </p><p>its efforts to find a compromise that would allow the U.S. </p><p>delegation in Durban to join the WCAR.  If the U.S. did not </p><p>participate, it would be a "big loss" for what is "supposed </p><p>to be a world conference."  Nigeria felt the WCAR should look </p><p>forward.  It was right to redress the current impact of past </p><p>injustice but not helpful to revisit the past. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
