SUMMARY:  U.S. WARNINGS TO SYRIA, U.S. CONTROL OF IRAQ, AND </p><p>TODAY\'S MEETING IN NASSERIYA FOR IRAQI COMMUNITY LEADERS </p><p>DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA.  UAE COLUMNIST AYSHA SULTAN </p><p>WROTE IN "AL BAYAN" THAT SYRIA IS NOT THE ONLY TARGET.  AN "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL DESCRIBED THE IRAQI OPPOSITION MEETING AS "A </p><p>TRUE TEST."  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" CARRIED </p><p>A FIRST PAGE ARTICLE PUBLISHED BY LONDON BASED "SAWT AL OROBA." </p><p>THE ARTICLE INCLUDED A STATEMENT BY AN AMERICAN OFFICIAL ABOUT A </p><p>DEAL BETWEEN U.S. FORCES AND IRAQI ARMED FORCES THAT LED TO THE </p><p>FALL OF BAGHDAD.  FURTHER DETAILS WERE REPORTED IN AN INTERNAL </p><p>ARTICLE IN "AL BAYAN."  THE ARTICLE CLAIMED THAT THE DEAL WAS </p><p>CONTINGENT UPON THE BOMBING OF AL JAZEERA AND ABU DHABI TV AT THE </p><p>PALESTINE HOTEL TO PROHIBIT MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE DEAL. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ABU DHABI TV AIRED A TWO-HOUR PROGRAM LAST NIGHT THAT DEVOTED </p><p>ONE WHOLE HOUR TO DISCUSSING THE THEORY OF OIL BEING THE MAIN </p><p>OBJECTIVE FOR U.S.\'S WAR AGAINST IRAQ.  THE PROGRAM CORRESPONDENT </p><p>JASSEM AZZAWI INTERVIEWED THE FORMER SAUDI OIL MINISTER, MOHAMMED </p><p>ZAKI AL YAMANI, WHO DEEPENED THIS IDEA AND NOTED THAT HE </p><p>PREDICTED THIS WAR IN 1996. </p><p> </p><p>4.  SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" CARRIED THE </p><p>ATTACHED CARTOON, FOR WHICH THE CAPTION READS:  "DON\'T MAKE A </p><p>MISTAKE ... THERE\'S A BIG DIFFERENCE ... I AM NOT LIKE HIM ... </p><p>HULAGU DROWNED THE BAGHDAD LIBRARY ... I BURNED IT!!!"  (NOTE: </p><p>HULAGU KHAN IS THE MONGHOL EMPEROR WHO SACKED AND BURNED BAGHDAD </p><p>IN 1258.  DURING HIS DESTRUCTION OF BAGHDAD, HULAGU ORDERED THE </p><p>BOOKS OF THE BAGHDAD LIBRARY THROWN INTO THE TIGRES RIVER TO </p><p>SYMBOLIZE HIS DESTRUCTION OF NOT ONLY THE CITY BUT A CULTURE, A </p><p>CIVILIZATION, AND A PEOPLE\'S HISTORY.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  ENGLISH-LANGUAGE EXPATRIATE-ORIENTED GULF NEWS CARRIED FRONT- </p><p>PAGE A FRENCH PRESS AGENCY (AFP) WIRE ARTICLE ON THE SELECTION OF </p><p>U.S. AMBASSADOR TO MOROCCO MARGARET TUTWILER TO SUPERVISE PUBLIC </p><p>RELATIONS FOR THE OFFICE OF HUMANITARIAN AND RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>ASSISTANCE IN IRAQ. </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENTING ON THE EXPECTED IRAQI OPPOSITION MEETING TODAY IN </p><p>NASSERIYA, SEMI-OFFICIAL ABU DHABI-BASED ARABIC DAILY "AL- </p><p>ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 4/15: </p><p> </p><p>"... THIS MEETING IS A TRUE TEST FOR OPPOSITION MEMBERS OF </p><p>VARIOUS LOYALTIES, ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN MANY DOUBTS ARE </p><p>RISING, IN ADDITION TO THEIR VARIOUS LOYALTIES, THEIR </p><p>CONNECTIONS, AND THEIR ABILITY TO EXPRESS THEIR PEOPLE\'S </p><p>INTERESTS TRULY ... WILL THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ, WHO ARE NOT IN THE </p><p>OPPOSITION ANYMORE, SUCCEED IN BECOMING A PART OF THE PRESENT AND </p><p>FUTURE OF THE NEW IRAQ?" </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN A CLOSING STATEMENT, SALEM WROTE IN "AL-KHALEEJ" ON 4/15: </p><p> </p><p>"... WE ALL REMEMBER THE OUTCRY THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE WHOLE </p><p>WORLD WHEN THE TALIBAN SOME YEARS AGO DESTROYED THE \'BUDDHA\' </p><p>STATUE IN AFGHANISTAN.  ONE OF THE COUNTRIES THAT DISAPPROVED OF </p><p>THIS WAS OF COURSE THE U.S., WHO IS CONCERNED, AS IT CLAIMS, WITH </p><p>HUMANITY, CIVILIZATION, AND HERITAGE.  BUT WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING </p><p>IN BAGHDAD, BASRA, AND MOSUL OF THE LOOTING OF MUSEUMS (INCLUDING </p><p>AN INHERITANCE DAITING MORE THAN 5 THOUSAND YEARS) UNDER THE EYES </p><p>OF THE U.S. TROOPS, ASSERTS THAT THE U.S. IS USING HUMANITY, </p><p>CIVILIZATION, AND HERITAGE AS A \'RASPBERRY LEAF\' TO COVER THEIR </p><p>BARBARISM."  (NOTE:  CERTAIN RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS CLAIM RASPBERRY </p><p>LEAVES WERE USED BY ADAM AND EVE TO COVER THEMSELVES UPON THE </p><p>REALIZATION OF THEIR NAKEDNESS IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN.  END NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>8.  RESPONDING TO U.S. WARNINGS TO SYRIA, UAE COLUMNIST AYSHA </p><p>SULTAN WROTE IN "AL BAYAN" ON 4/15: </p><p> </p><p>"THE QUESTION ON EVERYONE\'S MIND IN THE ARAB WORLD IS SUMMARIZED </p><p>IN THREE WORDS:  WHOSE TURN IS IT?  THIS MEANS THE NEXT U.S. </p><p>TARGET AFTER IRAQ!  THE QUESTION IS VERY CRUEL AND PAINFUL BUT </p><p>THE ANSWER IS NOT AS EASY AS PEOPLE THINK.  UK FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>JACK STRAW STATED THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT ABOUT A LIST AND THAT </p><p>SYRIA IS NOT THE NEXT TARGET.  YES, THE ISSUE IS NOT A LIST </p><p>BECAUSE EVERYONE IS A TARGET AND THE NEXT TARGET IS NOT ONLY </p><p>SYRIA.  WHAT THIS MEANS IS NOT ONLY THE REGIMES, EVERYONE IS </p><p>GOING TO FACE THIS WHIRLWIND:  REGIMES AND PEOPLE, </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS AND LIBERALS, ARAB NATIONALISTS AND MUSLIMS ... </p><p>EVERYONE WILL FACE THIS WHIRLWIND!!" </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
