BROWNE; REASONS 1.5 (B) AND </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) The ad-hoc inter-ministerial committee tasked by </p><p>President Obasanjo to review our proposed Article 98 </p><p>agreement met Tuesday, June 17.  According to a source from </p><p>the Foreign Ministry who attended the session, committee </p><p>members decided to recommend to President Obasanjo that </p><p>Nigeria conclude an Article 98 agreement with the U.S.  We </p><p>were informed that a position paper was being prepared, </p><p>forwarding the committee\'s positive recommendation to </p><p>Obasanjo.  While the recommendation was positive, the </p><p>committee\'s report would also present some questions about </p><p>Article 98 that committee members believed needed to be </p><p>addressed before Nigeria signed an agreement.  We were not </p><p>told what those questions might be, but understand that the </p><p>GON would forward the questions to us once Obasanjo has </p><p>reviewed the committee\'s report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) We do not know if the committee\'s report has been </p><p>forwarded to the President, but the Nigerians are well </p><p>aware of the July 1 deadline. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In our recent meeting with President Obasanjo, he </p><p>reiterated his desire to see the issue "behind him." </p><p>Obasanjo also asserted that if Article 98 could protect a </p><p>Nigerian peacekeeper being brought before the ICC he would </p><p>support signing an agreement.  While the Nigerians have not </p><p>provided formal notification that they would sign an </p><p>Article 98 agreement, the news of the committee\'s </p><p>recommendation and its consistency with the President\'s </p><p>statements of support make the prospects for a timely </p><p>Article 98 agreement look significantly better than they </p><p>did several weeks ago. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
