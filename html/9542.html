<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004550 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/28/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: MFA DISCUSSES ARMENIA, CAUCASUS ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary:  MFA officials have provided us with the </p><p>latest GOT thinking on developments regarding Armenia and the </p><p>Caucasus, including efforts to reach out to the Armenian </p><p>Diaspora in the U.S. and elsewhere, and heightened attention </p><p>to the strategic situation in the Caucasus region in the wake </p><p>of the Iraq war.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>Diaspora, NK </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Ecvet Tezcan, DG for Intelligence and Research, told </p><p>us following his recent visits with the Armenian Diaspora </p><p>that he is trying to put together a package that combines </p><p>improving access to Armenian religious sites in Turkey with </p><p>improved Turkish-Armenian state relations as a way to move </p><p>past the "genocide" issue.  On the Diaspora issue, Tezcan </p><p>said that the GOT is exploring identifying the Armenian </p><p>religious sites at Ani and Akdamar Island in Lake Van as </p><p>World Patrimony, conducting restoration work and promoting a </p><p>visit to these sites by leading Armenian Patriarchs.  During </p><p>such a visit Turkish authorities would be prepared to express </p><p>sorrow at the tragedy of 1915-1918 events.  The opening of </p><p>the sites would be accompanied by establishment of reciprocal </p><p>academic institutes -- for Armenian and Turkish scholars in </p><p>Yerevan to access relevant archives and study the events to </p><p>provide greater historical perspective. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) On the state side Tezcan suggested that he believed </p><p>the Diaspora could support a package of measures yielding </p><p>Turkish-Armenian rapprochement if delivered from </p><p>Nagorno-Karabakh (NK).  He suggested Armenia could recognize </p><p>the existing border indirectly, either by confirming </p><p>pre-existing treaties or accepting the OSCE resolution on the </p><p>inviolability of Soviet borders.  The Armenians might also </p><p>withdraw from a limited number of occupied areas whole </p><p>keeping others linked to the NK dispute.  In exchange Turkey </p><p>would be able to open the Armenian border and pursue further </p><p>rapprochement, without linkage to NK.  Tezcan suggested he </p><p>had found significant support for this approach in the </p><p>Diaspora as he portrayed an opening with Turkey as the only </p><p>way to avoid further deterioration in Armenia and greater </p><p>dependence on Russia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Strategic Considerations </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In a July 16 meeting MFA Caucasus DDG Ertan Tezgor </p><p>related to A/POL that discussions with Armenian officials at </p><p>and since the Madrid Summit have focused on a package of </p><p>issues aimed at normalizing GOT-GOA relations, including: 1) </p><p>efforts to elicit Armenian acceptance of Turkish territorial </p><p>integrity and existing borders; 2) the matter of "Armenian </p><p>genocide" and the Diaspora; and 3) resolution of the NK </p><p>conflict -- with Tezgor asserting that, in the GOT view, an </p><p>NK settlement, while important, is "no longer a precondition" </p><p>for improving bilateral ties.  According to Tezgor, Armenian </p><p>F.M. Ozkanian is pleased with the fact that NK is not, </p><p>strictly speaking, a quid pro quo, adding that while the </p><p>Turks expect continuing good faith efforts to solve the </p><p>problem, the change in attitude paves the way for progress on </p><p>the other fronts.  A solution to NK, Tezgor said, is "crucial </p><p>for the Armenians"; Yerevan has its own domestic political </p><p>and other reasons to press ahead.  The problem is that GOA </p><p>policy making is dominated by ethnic NKers, who look to </p><p>Russia for support.  Ozkanian, meanwhile, is trying to make </p><p>sure that Armenia\'s ties to the West are not undercut. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Tezgor went on at length about the Russians, who he </p><p>said in the aftermath of the Iraq war are increasingly </p><p>exhibiting a "Czarist mentality."  Moscow is seeking to </p><p>exploit a power and interest vacuum caused in part by the </p><p>diversion of USG attention elsewhere.  The Iranians are also </p><p>increasingly active, for similar reasons.  Tezgor admonished </p><p>that the USG and Turkey "should work together" against these </p><p>challenges.  He elaborated that Russia in particular is </p><p>trying to drag Turkey into diplomatic initiatives, along with </p><p>Iran, that are designed in part to undercut USG influence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) A/Pol queried whether, given the MFA\'s careful </p><p>attention to domestic political developments on this front in </p><p>Armenia, Russia and even the USG, Tezgor could provide a </p><p>similar analysis about the lay of the land in Ankara.  This </p><p>would be helpful, given that we have heard public comments on </p><p>occasion from officials who take a far more benign view of </p><p>Russia and others in the region -- notably Gen. Tuncer </p><p>Kilinc, current SecGen of the powerful Turkish NSC.  Tezgor </p><p>acknowledged that there are different views and considerable </p><p>sensitivities in Ankara, but that his view, not Kilinc\'s, is </p><p>the dominant one.  That said, Tezgor also asserted that </p><p>tensions in USG-GOT mil-mil relations since the Iraq war -- </p><p>and particularly since the July 4 incident involving the </p><p>brief detention of Turkish soldiers by U.S. forces in </p><p>Suleimaniyah -- have created opportunities for "mischief" </p><p>(yaramazlik) in the Caucasus and elsewhere by casting a </p><p>shadow over the bilateral military relationship. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Tezgor noted that he would be traveling to the </p><p>Caucasus on July 20, and will be in Yerevan at the Yerevan </p><p>hotel July 21-22.  He would be more than happy to discuss the </p><p>issues with Ambassador Ordway if the opportunity presents </p><p>itself, he noted. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
