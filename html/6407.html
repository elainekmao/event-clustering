<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 000944 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/M, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, IIP/G/NEA- </p><p>SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, MARCH 16: IRAQ; FRENCH </p><p>OPPOSITION TO WAR; ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p> </p><p>REF: KUWAIT 00900 </p><p> </p><p>1.   Summary: Kuwaiti commentators lash out at France as the </p><p>embodiment of opposition to war against Saddam\'s regime. The </p><p>Arab League delegation to the US, and possibly to Baghdad, </p><p>is derided as a "tour group." In an op/ed entitled "A Leader </p><p>is Needed at the White House," one commentator remarks </p><p>baldly: "President Bush can regain (his) leadership by </p><p>giving the order to start the war." </p><p> </p><p>Strong criticism of US policy remains, however, with </p><p>Secretary Rumsfeld being branded as a "criminal" for </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>"providing Saddam with WMD during Iraq\'s war against Iran." </p><p>Another writer states, "the demonstrations around the world </p><p>may not prevent the US from starting the war, but America </p><p>has lost many of its supporters because of the way it treats </p><p>other nations." </p><p> </p><p>The radical Islamist "Salafist" group in Kuwait defends its </p><p>opposition to what they term a "new Crusade" in Iraq </p><p>(reftel) as "no different from the official Kuwaiti </p><p>position." End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of </p><p>Foreign Affairs Shaikh Sabah Al-Ahmad stated ruled out any </p><p>possibility for a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis, </p><p>and said that Kuwait\'s participation in the reconstruction </p><p>of Iraq would be discussed later. </p><p> </p><p>The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Interior for Security </p><p>Services and State Security Major General Abdullah Al-Faris </p><p>denied that the Ministry tortures those who object to the </p><p>American presence in Kuwait as reported in the Arab </p><p>Committee for Human Rights report. </p><p> </p><p>Public prosecution has ordered the detention of five men </p><p>accused of plotting sabotage extended for 21 more days. </p><p> </p><p>Assistant Secretary General for Media Affairs of the </p><p>Scientific Salafi Movement, Dr. Sajed Al-Abdali defended </p><p>their strongly worded position statement of last week </p><p>(reftel) against US military action by saying that it is no </p><p>different from the official Kuwaiti position. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassah reports that Kuwaitis have opened accounts in </p><p>the Iraqi currency in Jordanian banks. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan reports that four GCC soldiers in Kuwait as part of </p><p>the common defense "Peninsula Shield" forces have resigned </p><p>in accordance with a fatwa forbidding support for an </p><p>American-led war on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "French Justifications" </p><p>MP Ahmad Al-Rubei wrote in independent Al-Qabas (3/15):  "It </p><p>is very obvious that the French position is the main reason </p><p>for Iraq\'s stubbornness for not complying with the </p><p>international community demand to eliminate WMD. If France </p><p>is against the war, then why does not it use its good </p><p>relations with Saddam to tell him that he is the core of the </p><p>problem?" </p><p> </p><p>4.  "Great France and the Late Adulthood" </p><p>Adel Al-Khudari wrote in independent Al-Watan (3/16):  "I </p><p>believe that the reason behind France\'s threat to use the </p><p>veto is because France may not get the lion\'s share of the </p><p>contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq.  France\'s attempt </p><p>to defend the most worthless dictator on earth would damage </p><p>its reputation because by doing so, it ignores the Iraqi </p><p>opposition and human rights." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Who Dares to Say?" </p><p>Former MP Ahmad Al-Baghli wrote in independent Al-Qabas </p><p>(3/13):  "The Arab League delegation formed after the Sharm </p><p>El-Shaikh Arab Summit is no more than a tour group. The only </p><p>American official who met with them was Secretary of State </p><p>Powell. [and] they met with him so they can say that they </p><p>have done something. The same delegation stated that they </p><p>would also visit Iraq to meet with Saddam to convince him to </p><p>step down from power. [but] would any member of this </p><p>delegation, namely [Arab League Secretary General] Amr </p><p>Moussa, dare to tell Saddam to step down.?" </p><p> </p><p>6.  "Saddam\'s Initiative for Bush to Step Down" </p><p>Abdelrahman Al-Ajmi wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/13): </p><p>"Should Bush respond to Saddam Hussein\'s proposal and submit </p><p>his resignation, this will not be met with satisfaction by </p><p>the American electorate, because it is the people who elect </p><p>their president. But, if Saddam relinquishes power, the </p><p>Iraqis will be overjoyed." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "A Leader is Required at the White House" </p><p>Abdelameer Al-Turkei wrote in independent Al-Seyassah </p><p>(3/16):  "We are not advising President Bush to be a leader, </p><p>but rather want to remind him of John Kennedy, who was able </p><p>to eliminate the dangers of Soviet missiles in Cuba. </p><p>President Bush can regain this leadership by giving the </p><p>order to start the war. The moment he does that, all who </p><p>object to his policies will retreat." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "Protests Will Not Stop the War" </p><p>Ahmad Al-Jarallah wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (3/16): </p><p>"Focusing on these [anti-war] protests results in </p><p>obstructing the views of people who support a war against </p><p>Iraq, and who constitute a majority among Arab decision- </p><p>makers and Westerners. The US has pledged to establish a new </p><p>democratic regime in Iraq by giving Iraqis the freedom to </p><p>elect their regime and to take control over their country\'s </p><p>resources. Some parts of the Arab world are arranging such </p><p>protests on the presumption that Saddam Hussein will defeat </p><p>the US. </p><p> </p><p>9.  "Even You, Annan" </p><p>Salah Al-Fadhli wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (3/16): </p><p>"Even Kofi Annan, who is America\'s man at the United </p><p>Nations, stated that any military action without UN approval </p><p>would be considered a violation of the UN convention. </p><p>America has crossed all the red lines, and has no </p><p>consideration for anybody. The demonstrations around the </p><p>world may not prevent the US from starting the war, but </p><p>America has lost many of its supporters because of the way </p><p>it treats other nations." </p><p> </p><p>10.  "Halabja and Rumsfeld" </p><p>Ahamd Al-Daieen wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (3/16): </p><p>"Fifteen years after the massacre at Halabja in Iraq in </p><p>which Saddam used WMD against his own people, Secretary of </p><p>Defense Rumsfeld is leading an unprecedented military </p><p>campaign to topple Saddam and to disarm Iraq. Ironically, </p><p>Rumsfeld\'s name is associated with the Halabja massacre. He </p><p>was involved in providing Saddam with WMD during Iraq\'s war </p><p>against Iran during the Regan Administration. Saddam Hussein </p><p>and Ali Hassan Majeed [the Iraqi military governor of Kuwait </p><p>during the 1990-91 occupation]. are not the only criminals." </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
