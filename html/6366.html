<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001632 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/14/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, TU, UNHRC-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: 59TH COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS DEMARCHE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 64728 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Poloff March 13 discussed reftel talking points with </p><p>Kaan Esener, head of the MFA Council of Europe Department, </p><p>and his deputy, Serhat Aksen.  Esener and Aksen noted that </p><p>Turkey will participate as an EU candidate country in certain </p><p>EU coordination meetings at the Commission.  They said the </p><p>GOT looked forward to working with the USG.  In general, </p><p>Esener said, the GOT is sensitive about "sometimes unfair" </p><p>international criticism of its own human rights record, and </p><p>therefore tends to favor thematic resolutions rather than </p><p>country-specific resolutions.  However, he said, the GOT </p><p>recognizes there is often broad support for country-specific </p><p>resolutions and does not rule out support. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Aksen said Turkey is close to both the Western and </p><p>Islamic Commission members, and can sometimes help bridge </p><p>gaps.  He said the GOT shares the USG view that resolutions </p><p>on the Arab-Israeli conflict should be balanced.  Esener said </p><p>in the past Western Commission members have undermined their </p><p>own good efforts by failing to consult with others on the </p><p>Commission before introducing resolutions.  He said the GOT </p><p>will try to prevent this from happening during the next </p><p>session. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
