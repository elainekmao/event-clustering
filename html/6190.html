<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 001470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/07/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: HADEP: KURDS FEAR IRAQ WAR WILL LEAD TO CRACKDOWN </p><p>IN SOUTHEAST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 1362 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 1341 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 1303 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter.  Reason: 1.5(b) and </p><p>(d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Ahmet Turan Demir, chairman of the pro-Kurdish HADEP </p><p>Party, and Nazmi Gur, HADEP international relations advisor, </p><p>told us March 4 anti-war sentiment in the southeast is fueled </p><p>primarily by Kurdish fear of the Turkish military.  Many </p><p>Turks might oppose a war on principle, or out of concern that </p><p>Turkey will be attacked or suffer economic setbacks.  But </p><p>Kurds in the southeast worry the Turkish military will use a </p><p>war as justification to restrict freedoms and provoke a </p><p>violent conflict. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Demir and Gur repeated concerns expressed by other </p><p>Embassy contacts (reftels) that elements of the military were </p><p>isolating jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and recommending </p><p>that the GOT impose a war-related state of emergency in the </p><p>southeast as part of a broad effort to increase pressure on </p><p>the Kurds.  Gur said he noticed Jandarma tightening controls </p><p>at roadway checkpoints during a recent trip to the region. </p><p>Even the retrial of four Kurdish former MPs is a potential </p><p>source of conflict, as the HADEP leaders shared concerns </p><p>(reported reftel A) that the court is biased against the </p><p>defendants.  Demir said the combined force of these pressures </p><p>could cause a conflict between the Turkish military and the </p><p>broader Kurdish community, not just KADEK (formerly PKK). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Comment: The HADEP leaders\' comments represent the </p><p>latest example of a consistent message we are hearing from </p><p>all our Kurdish contacts of differing political persuasions. </p><p>Deep-rooted mistrust of the GOT (particularly the military) </p><p>is causing anti-war sentiment among a population otherwise </p><p>inclined to support the U.S. view that Saddam Hussein is a </p><p>threat, and one that may stand to gain economically from a </p><p>war. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
