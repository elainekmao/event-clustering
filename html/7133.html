<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L OTTAWA 000985 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, PREL, MARR, CA, NATO </p><p>SUBJECT: ISAF: CANADIAN RECONNAISSANCE TEAM VISIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: OTTAWA 540 AND PREVIOUS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, </p><p>Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: Canada remains committed to providing a </p><p>battle group and brigade headquarters to ISAF IV and V, but </p><p>is making clear to potential partners that it will not serve </p><p>as a lead or co-lead nation.  While hoping for a substantial </p><p>NATO role, Canada expects that Germany will end up as lead </p><p>nation for ISAF IV, and is discussing division of labor with </p><p>the Bundeswehr.  Canada expects its area of responsibility to </p><p>be western Kabul, the most insecure of the sectors now being </p><p>patrolled by ISAF and the expected site of the constitutional </p><p>Loya Jirga in October.  For sustainment purposes, Canada may </p><p>need to shift its transport aircraft in theater from </p><p>Operation Enduring Freedom to ISAF.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) A Canadian "strategic reconnaissance team" visited </p><p>Afghanistan and Germany in late March to look at the security </p><p>and political environment in which ISAF operates, and to </p><p>discuss Canada\'s contributions to ISAF IV and V.  The </p><p>Canadian team was led by BGEN Andrew Leslie and included </p><p>representatives from National Defense (DND), Foreign Affairs </p><p>(DFAIT), and International Development (CIDA). </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Wendy Gilmour, DFAIT Deputy Director for Regional </p><p>Security and Peacekeeping and a member of the Canadian team, </p><p>told us on April 4 that they stressed with all interlocutors </p><p>that Canada will not/not be lead or co-lead nation for ISAF </p><p>IV and V.  Canada remains committed to being a "substantial </p><p>partner" for those phases of ISAF, to include a battle group, </p><p>a brigade headquarters, and a flag officer plus staff for </p><p>ISAF headquarters, a total of 1500  personnel.  But the </p><p>Canadian Forces do not have the resources to take on other </p><p>tasks - e.g., airport operations and field hospitals - should </p><p>gaps emerge, and therefore the GoC does not want to cast </p><p>itself as a lead nation.  That said, Afghan officials and </p><p>ISAF participants were delighted that Canada will be </p><p>providing more boots on the ground.  German leadership has </p><p>increased ISAF patrols this year, but this remains a deficit </p><p>area. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Gilmour said that the German/Dutch Corps headquarters </p><p>will depart ISAF in August in order to meet its NATO </p><p>commitments.  While the Dutch expect to maintain little or no </p><p>personnel for ISAF IV, the Germans will maintain a </p><p>substantial presence.  Gilmour said that while both Canada </p><p>and Germany hope NATO will play an increased role, the </p><p>Bundeswehr believes it will fall to Germany to be the lead </p><p>nation for ISAF IV.  GEN Reichman, head of Bundeswehr </p><p>Operational Command, told the Canadians that his "emergency </p><p>contingency plan" was for a divisional headquarters within </p><p>the German/U.S. Corps to take the lead for ISAF IV.  Gilmour </p><p>recognized that the German government has not yet made a </p><p>decision about ISAF IV, and that the German MFA has not yet </p><p>accepted the need for continuity of command. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) German military officials were initially resistant to </p><p>a Canadian brigade headquarters, given that Germany had </p><p>planned to maintain their current brigade headquarters into </p><p>ISAF IV.  But as the likelihood grows of serving as lead </p><p>nation for ISAF IV, Gilmour said, the Germans have become </p><p>more receptive to handing over the brigade headquarters </p><p>function.  The Bundeswehr is sending a team to Canada on </p><p>April 15 to discuss the requirements for transfer of brigade </p><p>leadership. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Gilmour said that a decision brief on Canada\'s force </p><p>composition for ISAF will be presented to Chief of Defense </p><p>Staff GEN Henault the week of April 7.  In order to be </p><p>available in Afghanistan in August, Canadian military </p><p>equipment will need to set sail by the end of May.  Gilmour </p><p>also noted that given sustainment challenges, Canada may need </p><p>to re-assign three Hercules transport aircraft currently in </p><p>Operation Enduring Freedom to ISAF.  We told her that </p><p>Canadian Forces planners should discuss this possibility with </p><p>U.S. military counterparts. </p><p>CELLUCCI </p><p></p></div>
