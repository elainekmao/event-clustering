SUMMARY:  THE SHARM AL SHEIKH AND AQABA SUMMITS, THE US </p><p>"FAILURE" TO FIND WMD IN IRAQ, AND ISRAEL\'S ATTACK ON HAMAS </p><p>LEADERS GENERATED EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL PRINT </p><p>AND SATELLITE MEDIA.  AN "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL COMMENTED ON </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S "ANNOYANCE" AT THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON </p><p>HAMAS LEADER ABDULAZIZ AL RANTEESI YESTERDAY.   UNDER THE "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" HEADLINE, "FUTURE OF IRAQ," DR. SHAMLAN AL EISSA </p><p>COMMENTED ON THE CURRENT SITUATION IN IRAQ.  ANOTHER "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIAL CLAIMED THAT THE U.S. "FAILURE" TO FIND WMD IN IRAQ IS </p><p>A "STORM" IN THE FACE OF PRESIDENT BUSH AND PM BLAIR.  AN "AL </p><p>KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL ASSERTED THAT THE U.S. IS NOT ALLOWING OTHER </p><p>PARTIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROADMAP.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL BAYAN" CARRIED </p><p>A TWO-PART INTERVIEW WITH FORMER IRAQI REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UN </p><p>MOHAMMED AL DOURI.  DURING HIS INTERVIEW, HE CRITICIZED THE </p><p>PREVIOUS REGIME AND ALL THE CRIMES COMMITTED DURING THAT ERA. </p><p>MR. AL DOURI ALSO CLAIMED THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING IN IRAQ, </p><p>INCLUDING THE LOOTING, WAS PLANNED BY THE U.S. AND THAT U.S. </p><p>POLICY IN IRAQ MIGHT LEAD TO A CIVIL WAR. </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENTING ON THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT OF ABDULAZIZ AL </p><p>RANTEESI YESTERDAY AND ON PRESIDENT BUSH\'S "ANNOYANCE" TOWARDS </p><p>WHAT HAPPENED, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 6/11: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE GOAL BEHIND THIS ATTEMPT IS OBVIOUS ... THAT IS WHY IT </p><p>DESERVES THE AMERICAN ANGER THAT WAS RIGHT ON TIME ... ISRAEL </p><p>SHOULD STOP ITS POLICY OF DELUDING THE WORLD AND SHOULD REALIZE </p><p>THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO REALLY JOIN A SERIOUS AND JUST PEACE </p><p>PROCESS WHICH HAS LONG BEEN AWAITED IN THE REGION." </p><p> </p><p>4.  CRITICIZING ISRAEL\'S ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON AL RANTEESI, </p><p>SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 6/11: </p><p> </p><p>"... THERE IS NO SOLUTION WITH THESE ASSASSINS.  AFTER 55 YEARS </p><p>OF \'ATTEMPTING\' THEM, IT IS TIME FOR THE CONCERNED PEOPLE IN </p><p>PALESTINE AND THE ARAB COUNTRIES TO STOP THESE \'ATTEMPTS\' AND </p><p>\'TESTS\' THAT MIGHT LEAD TO THE SURRENDER OF THE WHOLE REGION, NOT </p><p>ONLY PALESTINE, TO THOSE \'NAZIS\' AND ALL WHO SUPPORT THEM AND </p><p>COVER UP FOR THEIR MASSACRES ..." </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "WHO WILL STOP SHARON," ABU DHABI-BASED </p><p>PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIALIZED 6/11: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE GOVERNMENT OF SHARON WILL NOT MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>EMPHASIZE ITS HOSTILITY TOWARDS PEACE AND ITS INSISTENCE ON </p><p>BURYING ANY CHANCE FOR THIS PROCESS (PEACE).  THE OBLIGATION OF </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS TO EXPRESS ITS REFUSAL OF THIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S HOSTILE AND IMMORAL BEHAVIOR ..." </p><p> </p><p>6.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "MOTHER OF SCANDALS," "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 6/10: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE SCANDALS OF ATTACKS AND OCCUPATION WILL NOT END, THE </p><p>WEAPONS ISSUE IS A LIE, THE UNNEEDED DEMOCRACY, HANDING OVER THE </p><p>POSTPONED ADMINISTRATION TO IRAQIS, THE OIL THAT IS BEING STOLEN, </p><p>AND THE INSECURITY AND INSTABILITY ARE ALL INITIAL INDICATIONS OF </p><p>THE \'MOTHER OF SCANDALS\'." </p><p> </p><p>7.  UNDER THE HEADLINE, "FUTURE OF IRAQ," DR. SHAMLAN AL EISSA </p><p>WROTE IN "AL ITTIHAD" ON 6/08: </p><p> </p><p>"... NO ONE CAN DENY THAT THE U.S. TROOPS OCCUPYING IRAQ HAVE </p><p>PARTICIPATED LARGELY IN THE DETERIORATION OF THE SITUATION ... </p><p>MOST IMPORTANTLY IS THE POLITICAL FUMBLING OF THE U.S. IN IRAQ </p><p>THROUGH THE GOVERNOR OF BAGHDAD ... WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR THE </p><p>IRAQI PEOPLE AFTER ITS LIBERATION?  THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND THE </p><p>NATIONAL POWERS ARE STILL IN CONFLICT REGARDING A CLEAR WORK </p><p>PROGRAM, THAT IS WHY IT WILL BE A MESS IF THE AMERICANS LEAVE </p><p>IRAQ BEFORE STARTING A NEW FOUNDATION OPERATING IN DEMOCRACY, </p><p>DIVERSITY, AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ... THE IRAQI PEOPLE </p><p>SHOULD INSIST ON REQUESTING THAT THE OCCUPYING TROOPS ORGANIZE </p><p>THE SITUATION IN IRAQ ... THE GULF COUNTRIES HAVE A BIG </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY IN HELPING THE IRAQI PEOPLE OVERCOME THEIR CRISIS. </p><p>HUMANITARIAN AID AND PARTICIPATING IN RECONSTRUCTION ARE TWO </p><p>POSITIVE STEPS, BUT WHAT IS ALSO NEEDED IS THAT THE GULF </p><p>COUNTRIES, THROUGH THEIR SATELLITE TV CHANNELS, SHOULD CALM </p><p>THINGS DOWN AND NOT MOBILIZE THE ARAB STREET AGAINST THE U.S ..." </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENTING ON THE U.S. TAKING SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE </p><p>ROADMAP, "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 6/07: </p><p> </p><p>"... FOR THE U.S. TO BE THE ONLY DECISION MAKER, THIS WILL NOT </p><p>FULFILL THE DESIRED LASTING SOLUTION AND FAIR RESPONSIBILITY IN </p><p>THE LEAST, SINCE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION </p><p>MINIMIZES ANY HOPE OF A JUST SOLUTION.  AGAIN THE U.S., </p><p>\'VICTORIOUS\' IN IRAQ, IMPOSED ITS REGIONAL AGENDA BY DOMINATING </p><p>THE DECISION FOR A SOLUTION TO THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE ON THE BASIS </p><p>OF GUARANTEEING THE \'ZIONIST COUNTRY\'S\' SECURITY, EVEN IF THIS </p><p>MEANS CREATING A PALESTINIAN CIVIL WAR SEEDED AT BOTH THE SHARM </p><p>AL SHEIKH AND AQABA SUMMITS." </p><p> </p><p>9.  URGING THAT ALL CONFLICTS AMONG PALESTINIANS BE OVERCOME, "AL- </p><p>BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 6/07: </p><p> </p><p>"... WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE AGAINST PALESTINIAN AND ARAB BENEFITS, </p><p>WHICH IS WHY ALL PALESTINIAN SIDES SHOULD REACH A UNIFIED VISION </p><p>IN ORDER TO OVERCOME ALL CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES THAT THE </p><p>OCCUPATION IS TRYING TO PUT BEFORE THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ..." </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENTING ON THE U.S. "FAILURE" TO FIND WMD IN IRAQ AS A </p><p>"STRONG" IN BUSH AND BLAIR\'S FACES BUT ASSERTING THAT THE ISSUE </p><p>FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE WAS NOT WMD BUT GETTING RID OF THE REGIME, </p><p>"AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED ON 6/06: </p><p> </p><p>"... ALTHOUGH BUSH AND BLAIR FAILED TO FIND EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY </p><p>THEIR WAR, THE IRAQI PEOPLE ARE SCORING SUCCESS EACH DAY BY </p><p>REVEALING THE CRIMES OF THE PREVIOUS REGIME ... SO THE ISSUE FOR </p><p>THE IRAQI PEOPLE WAS NOT FINDING THE WMD ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ITS </p><p>FIRST VICTIMS, BUT THE ISSUE WAS GETTING RID OF THE REGIME THAT </p><p>MADE IRAQ A PRISON ..." </p><p> </p><p>11.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "NOT FOR PEACE," "AL KHALEEJ" </p><p>EDITORIALIZED 6/05: </p><p> </p><p>"... THROUGH A THOROUGH READING OF WHAT WAS ANNOUNCED FOLLOWING </p><p>THE SHARM AL SHEIKH AND AQABA SUMMITS, WE COULD SIMPLY UNDERSTAND </p><p>THE INDICATION THAT THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM- WHATEVER ITS </p><p>MOTIVES AND REASONS- MEANS THE PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE AND NO ONE </p><p>ELSE, AND WHICH MEANS THAT WHAT ISRAEL COMMITS AGAINST THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN PEOPLE DOES NOT FALL UNDER THIS DESCRIPTION </p><p>(TERRORISM) ... PRESIDENT BUSH\'S CONCERN IS NOT PEACE WITHIN ITS </p><p>TRUE MEANING, BUT HIS CONCERN IS TO INSURE AMERICAN PEACE IN THE </p><p>REGION AFTER OCCUPYING IRAQ, IN ADDITION TO GUARANTEEING ISRAEL\'S </p><p>SECURITY EVEN IF THROUGH A PALESTINIAN CIVIL WAR, AND ALSO </p><p>PLACING SYRIA AND LEBANON ON THE SHELF UNTIL THEIR TURN COMES </p><p>FOLLOWING THE END OF THE PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE, SINCE THE </p><p>REQUEST IS THE SAME: ERASING ANY RESISTANCE AND ANY STAND THAT </p><p>MAY STOP AGREEMENTS WITH ZIONIST CONDITIONS." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
