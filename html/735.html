THE SAME DAY, ALL OF THE MEN OVER 55 AND UNDER 20 </p><p>HAD BEEN RELEASED, NINETY-THREE IN TOTAL.  THE POLICE THEN </p><p>BEGAN TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE IDENTITIES OF THE REMAINING </p><p>439 DETAINEES THROUGH DOCUMENT CHECKS, PHOTOGRAPHS, AND </p><p>FINGERPRINTING.  THESE MEN WERE THEN CHECKED AGAINST </p><p>CROATIAN GOVERNMENT RECORDS FOR ANY EVIDENCE OF "WAR </p><p>CRIMES." </p><p> </p><p>3. FROM MAY 6 UNTIL MAY 13 (WHEN THE CENTER WAS CLOSED), </p><p>THE LOCAL POLICE PROCESSED ALL THE REMAINING SERBS. OF THE </p><p>439 DETAINEES, 206 WERE RELEASED DIRECTLY BACK TO PAKRAC, </p><p>AND 219 WERE SENT FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION BY MILITARY </p><p>INVESTIGATIVE COURTS.  NINETY PERCENT OF THE LATTER WERE </p><p>SENT TO THE MILITARY COURT IN BJELOVAR.  THE REMAINING </p><p>FOURTEEN MEN WERE TRANSFERRED TO BJELOVAR TO GIVE </p><p>TESTIMONY AS WITNESSES AGAINST THEIR FELLOW DETAINEES.

THE MEN WERE ALL LYING ON MATTRESSES </p><p>ON THE MAIN GYM FLOOR.  FOR TWO MEALS A DAY AND SMOKING </p><p>PRIVILEGE, WEATHER PERMITTING, THE MEN WERE TAKEN EN MASSE </p><p>TO AN OUTDOOR PLAYGROUND.  INTERROGATIONS WERE HELD IN </p><p>UPSTAIRS OFFICES.  THE INTERROGATIONS WERE SAID TO TAKE ON </p><p>AVERAGE ONE TO TWO HOURS PER PERSON.  THEY WERE ONLY DONE </p><p>DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS.

AFTER A BRIEF TOUR OF THE GYM, POLOFF WAS ALLOWED TO </p><p>SPEAK IN PRIVATE (OUTDOORS) WITH DETAINEES THAT HE CHOSE </p><p>AT RANDOM FROM THE GROUP.  FIVE SEPARATE DETAINEES </p><p>DESCRIBED LIVING CONDITIONS AS SATISFACTORY.  THEY SAID </p><p>THE FOOD WAS SUFFICIENT AND OF GOOD QUALITY.  THEY HAD </p><p>BEEN VISITED BY BOTH ICRC AND THE UN.

NONE OF THE DETAINEES REPORTED SEEING ANY OTHERS </p><p>EVER TAKEN AWAY ALONE FROM THE GROUP, EXCEPT WHEN GOING UP </p><p>TO THE INTERVIEW ROOMS.  NONE RECALLED ANY DETAINEES NOT </p><p>RETURNING FROM THEIR INTERROGATIONS, OR COMING BACK WITH </p><p>OBVIOUS INJURIES OR BLEEDING. </p><p> </p><p>6. ASKED IF THERE HAD BEEN BEATINGS OR MISTREATMENT, NONE </p><p>OF THE PRISONERS CITED ANY SPECIFIC CASES.  THEY ALL </p><p>REPORTED THEY HAD SUFFERED NO ILL TREATMENT (ONE ADDED, </p><p>"GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES").  BUT THEY COULD NOT, OR WOULD </p><p>NOT, SAY THAT NO BEATINGS HAD TAKEN PLACE.  ONE MAN SAID, </p><p>"YOU WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO OTHERS TO FIND OUT," BUT WOULD </p><p>NOT PROVIDE ANY FURTHER DETAILS.  ASKED IF THEY WERE </p><p>AFRAID, THEY ALL SAID THEIR REAL FEAR WAS CAUSED BY THE </p><p>UNCERTAINTY OF WHERE THEY WERE GOING.  (NOTE: OF THE 139 </p><p>STILL THERE THAT DAY, THE CROATIANS SAY THEY TRANSFERRED </p><p>74 TO BJELOVAR AS POSSIBLE SUSPECTS.) </p><p>- </p><p>7. ASKED IF THEY PLANNED TO REMAIN IN CROATIA AFTER THEIR </p><p>RELEASE, ALL OF THE DETAINEES SAID THAT THEY WOULD MAKE </p><p>THAT DECISION BASED ON CONDITIONS BACK IN PAKRAC ONCE THEY </p><p>REACHED THERE. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. LIVING CONDITIONS AT THE DETENTION CENTER WERE NOT </p><p>UNBEARABLE, ALTHOUGH THEY MUST HAVE BEEN WORSE WHEN THE </p><p>CENTER WAS MORE CROWDED.  THE MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE, </p><p>HOWEVER, IS WHETHER VIOLENCE WAS USED AGAINST THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  01908  02 OF 03  171640Z </p><p>DETAINEES.  DESPITE RUMORS PICKED UP BY INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS OF PRISONERS BEATEN IN VARAZDIN, POLOFF </p><p>FOUND NO HARD EVIDENCE ON THE SCENE MAY 12 TO INDICATE </p><p>THIS WAS THE CASE.  IN WALKING THROUGH THE ROWS OF </p><p>DETAINEES, POLOFF COULD NOT EASILY SEE ANY SIGNS OF WOUNDS </p><p>OR BEATINGS.  (NOTE: IN PAKRAC MAY 16, EMBOFFS FOUND 2 </p><p>SERBS RECENTLY RELEASED FROM BJELOVAR WHO SHOWED US </p><p>BRUISES THEY CLAIMED TO HAVE RECEIVED IN VARAZDIN.  SEE </p><p>SEPTEL). </p><p> </p><p>9. THE ATTITUDE AND COMMENTS OF THE LOCAL POLICE, HOWEVER, </p><p>SUGGEST THAT THERE MAY WELL HAVE BEEN ROUGH TREATMENT OF </p><p>THOSE DETAINEES WHO THE POLICE BELIEVED HAD PARTICIPATED </p><p>IN ATROCITIES.  THE POLICE DREW A CLEAR DISTINCTION </p><p>BETWEEN THOSE DETAINEES WHO HAD NOT PARTICIPATED IN CRIMES </p><p>AGAINST CROATIA OR CIVILIANS, OR HAD MERELY FOLLOWED </p><p>ORDERS DURING MILITARY SERVICE, AND THOSE DETAINEES WHO </p><p>WERE BELIEVED TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN OR ORDERED </p><p>ATROCITIES.

BUT FOR THE LATTER GROUP (OR THOSE EVEN SUSPECTED OF </p><p>BELONGING TO THE LATTER GROUP), THE ATTITUDE WAS MUCH MORE </p><p>HARD-NOSED.  THE POLICE WERE CATEGORICAL THAT ANYONE WHO </p><p>WAS GUILTY OF "WAR CRIMES," AS DEFINED BY THE CROATIAN </p><p>AUTHORITIES, SHOULD BE HELD, PROSECUTED, AND PUNISHED, </p><p>REGARDLESS OF THE TERMS OF THE CEASEFIRE IN SECTOR WEST. </p><p>THERE WAS NO RECEPTIVENESS TO THE SUGGESTION THAT, UNDER </p><p>THE TERMS OF THE CEASEFIRE, THE POLICE SHOULD NOT HAVE </p><p>BEEN INVESTIGATING THE DETAINEES OR HOLDING SUSPECTED WAR </p><p>CRIMINALS.  AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THE POLICE </p><p>WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACT WITH ANY TENDERNESS OR CARE </p><p>TOWARD SUCH SUSPECTS.  OUR GUESS IS THAT THE MORE SERIOUS </p><p>THE CRIME A DETAINEE WAS SUSPECTED OF, THE ROUGHER HIS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  01908  03 OF 03  171640Z </p><p>TREATMENT BY THE POLICE DURING INTERROGATION. </p><p> </p><p>11. THE GUARDED COMMENTS OF THE DETAINEES ("OUR TREATMENT </p><p>IS SATISFACTORY, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES"), AND THE </p><p>APPEARANCE OF THOSE STILL IN THE SPORTS HALL, HOWEVER, </p><p>SUGGESTED THAT WHATEVER ROUGH TREATMENT BY THE POLICE </p><p>OCCURRED WAS NOT SYSTEMATIC AND WAS LIMITED (I.E., NO </p><p>MURDERS, DISAPPEARANCES, OR INJURIES SERIOUS ENOUGH TO </p><p>REQUIRE MEDICAL TREATMENT).  FINAL CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING </p><p>POLICE TREATMENT OF DETAINEES WILL REQUIRE FURTHER </p><p>INVESTIGATION, ESPECIALLY OF THE DETAINEES SUSPECTED OF </p><p>THE MOST SERIOUS CRIMES, WHO ARE NOW HELD IN THE MILITARY </p><p>PRISON IN BJELOVAR.  EMBASSY ALSO INTENDS TO PUSH THE </p><p>CROATIAN GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW FULLER ACCESS TO ICRC, WHICH </p><p>HAS COMPLAINED TO US OF LIMITS IMPOSED ON IT BY THE GOC. </p><p> </p><p>GALBRAITH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
