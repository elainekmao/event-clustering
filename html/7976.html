<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002775 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR L/UNA AND EB/ESC </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/11/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, IZ, JO, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQ SANCTIONS IMPLEMENTATION UNDER JORDANIAN LAW </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 123640 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: A/DCM Doug Silliman, reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (c)  Embassy has consulted with Trade Ministry and </p><p>Foreign Ministry officials to obtain answers to reftel </p><p>questions regarding sanctions implementation.  Answers keyed </p><p>to reftel questions: </p><p> </p><p>--  UNSCR 661 was implemented in Jordan by Prime Ministerial </p><p>decree.  Within the context of the sanctions regime, Jordan </p><p>has maintained a trade relationship with Iraq throughout the </p><p>sanctions period.  Jordan has exported to Iraq since 1991 </p><p>through the OFF program, through small-scale private </p><p>sector-to-private sector trade (primarily in agricultural </p><p>products and detergents), and through a bilateral oil and </p><p>trade protocol under which Jordan imported free and </p><p>subsidized oil from Iraq in return for a similar value of </p><p>commercial goods.  Jordan also imported small volumes of </p><p>agricultural products (primarily barley) from private </p><p>traders, and imported sulfur on a government-to-government </p><p>basis during the sanctions period.  The U.N. "took note" of </p><p>the oil and trade protocols in its resolutions establishing </p><p>sanctions on Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>--  Domestic measures to implement sanctions resolutions </p><p>consist of the aforementioned Prime Ministerial decree, and </p><p>could be reversed relatively easily.  The PM would issue a </p><p>decree voiding trade restrictions.  Such decrees implementing </p><p>UNSCR\'s are normal procedure for the GOJ, and would likely be </p><p>issued in a matter of days at most, according to our contacts. </p><p> </p><p>--  Since a decree was needed to operationalize the UNSCR </p><p>imposing sanctions, a second decree would be necessary to </p><p>operationalize any new UNSCR lifting sanctions - the </p><p>resolution would not in itself be sufficient to begin </p><p>large-scale imports of Iraqi products.  However, in light of </p><p>past behavior noted above, import of Iraqi goods prior to </p><p>issuance of such a decree would probably be tolerated. </p><p> </p><p>--  As noted above, a decree reversing sanctions could be </p><p>issued "virtually overnight" if the cabinet so chose. </p><p> </p><p>--  Not applicable. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
