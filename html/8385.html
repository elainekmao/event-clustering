<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000468 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV; DRL </p><p>PLEASE PASS TO CIRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O.12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, KIRF, SOCI, VM, RELFREE, HUMANR </p><p>SUBJECT: THE YIN AND YANG OF THE SEA STAR CATHOLIC SEMINARY </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 Ho Chi Minh City 1304 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Ambassador met with Father Tran </p><p>Thanh Phong, director of the Nha Trang Sea Star Seminary </p><p>during a visit to Khanh Hoa province, May 15-17.  During </p><p>the discussion, which took place in a large, well- </p><p>maintained reception hall, Father Phong was careful not to </p><p>explicitly criticize the GVN, but he did comment that it </p><p>might be difficult for Western logic to comprehend "the </p><p>convolutedness" of the Seminary/Catholic Church\'s </p><p>relationship with the Vietnamese Government.  Father Phong </p><p>painted a picture of a Catholic diocese that has made its </p><p>peace with the GVN, reconciled to enjoying some freedoms </p><p>while operating within certain restrictions.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Ambassador Raymond F. Burghardt and the Consul </p><p>General met for over an hour with Father Tran Thanh Phong. </p><p>Father Phong described the Sea Star Seminary as responsible </p><p>for training priests for three dioceses: Nha Trang (Khanh </p><p>Hoa province and Phan Rang in Ninh Thuan province); Buon Me </p><p>Thuot (Dak Lak province and part of Binh Phuoc province); </p><p>and Quy Nhon (Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, and Quang Ngai </p><p>provinces).  Six seminaries Q in Nha Trang, Hue, Hanoi, </p><p>Thanh Hoa, Ho Chi Minh City, and Can Tho Q are officially </p><p>recognized by the GVN.  Nha Trang was recognized ten years </p><p>ago.  (Prior to 1975, the Sea Star Seminary was a minor </p><p>one.  The major seminaries were those in Dalat and Saigon.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) According to Father Phong, Sea Star Seminary </p><p>currently has 84 seminarians who follow a six-year course </p><p>of study.  Every two years, each diocese is permitted to </p><p>select 10 candidates who have graduated from university. </p><p>The "ideal" candidate is about 25 years-old, has a </p><p>bachelor\'s degree, and gets the stamp of approval from the </p><p>local People\'s Committee and Ministry of Public Security </p><p>(MPS) for having a "sound mind" (here the priest smilingly </p><p>tapped his head). </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The six-year training program includes two years </p><p>of philosophy and four years of theology, as well as </p><p>courses on politics and economics Q taught by professors </p><p>assigned by the local authorities.  There is about a ten </p><p>percent drop out rate, but usually not due to a diagnosis </p><p>of wrong-headedness by the MPS.  The Ministry of Public </p><p>Security and the local government make their appearance </p><p>again at graduation, when they "check" the seminarians to </p><p>ensure they are still of "sound mind." </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) After graduation, the seminarians are usually </p><p>assigned as assistants for a two-year internship to </p><p>ordained priests.  After a successful internship (and by </p><p>that time, over the age of 30, the minimum age to become a </p><p>priest in Vietnam), they are ordained.  The diocese then </p><p>decides which parish to send the newly-ordained priest to - </p><p>as a junior priest, who will eventually take over as the </p><p>full parish priest.  There are currently 120 priests in the </p><p>Nha Trang diocese, according to Father Phong, many of whom </p><p>are old and infirm.  "We need a younger generation," he </p><p>emphasized.  Since the Sea Star Seminary is limited in its </p><p>intake of seminarians, Father Phong was asked whether any </p><p>devout Catholics go overseas to pursue their theological </p><p>studies.  He noted that they could go overseas as regular </p><p>students, but not as seminarians.  Only priests who are </p><p>trained and ordained in Vietnam can serve here. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Father Phong said that he and the Seminary get </p><p>along with the provincial government, but are required to </p><p>get permission from the authorities whenever they wanted to </p><p>travel or meet with outsiders Q including priests and </p><p>believers from other towns and diocese.  Local authorities </p><p>must approve the Seminary\'s training curriculum, the </p><p>professors/priests who will teach the classes, and their </p><p>lesson plans.  There have been no foreign priests as </p><p>teachers; the Seminary has never asked for permission </p><p>because it "knows the request will not be approved." (Post </p><p>Note: Demonstrating that situations are relative and vary </p><p>from province to province, it would appear Khanh Hoa </p><p>province exercises stricter control over the Catholic </p><p>Church than Ho Chi Minh City does.  The Catholic hierarchy </p><p>in HCMC generally travels unimpeded and simply notifies </p><p>local authorities of their plans Q sometimes after the </p><p>fact.  They also meet with ConGenoffs and other "outsiders" </p><p>without asking permission.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) However, Sea Star Seminary has been able to send </p><p>some faculty members to study in Rome, Paris, and the U.S. </p><p>Right now, bioethics is a sensitive issue, and regional </p><p>priests attended classes led by the Bishop of Can Tho </p><p>earlier this month.  In response to a question from the </p><p>Ambassador, Father Phong indicated that the Seminar </p><p>receives some financial assistance from Rome and its own </p><p>parishioners.  Individual overseas Vietnamese also donate, </p><p>but on a case-by-case basis. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) During a brief tour of the Seminary, the </p><p>Ambassador stopped by a darkened room with several </p><p>computers.  Father Phong explained that while seminarians </p><p>have access to the Internet, they are forbidden by the </p><p>provincial government to download any files.  (Post Note: </p><p>While we do not know specifically about the Catholic </p><p>seminary in HCMC, in cities like HCMC and Danang, the </p><p>internet cafes and universities can download from any </p><p>website that is not firewalled by the government.  End </p><p>note.)  The Sea Star Seminary itself is built on land </p><p>granted to it in compensation for the old building (now a </p><p>teachers\' college) in a different location.  Father Phong </p><p>ruefully chuckled when he related that the local government </p><p>said it was giving the Church a "good deal." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Comment:  Father Phong was an informative </p><p>interlocutor who became more animated as the discussion </p><p>progressed.  He acknowledged that Catholic life had been </p><p>difficult after the war, but said things had improved over </p><p>the past 10 years.  His statement that contemporary </p><p>Vietnamese society is deteriorating because people say the </p><p>right things, but do not act on principle or with virtue </p><p>could be interpreted as an oblique criticism of Vietnam\'s </p><p>current political system.  Although a priest, Father Phong </p><p>seemed to place some faith in the "yin" and "yang" of life, </p><p>and accept that in return for certain freedoms, there would </p><p>be certain restrictions on the Catholic Church in Khanh Hoa </p><p>province.
