<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 002257 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, JO, UNGA </p><p>SUBJECT: JORDAN SUGGESTS EUROPEAN INTERVENTION WITH ARAB </p><p>GROUP TO MODERATE LANGUAGE ON SPECIAL SESSION ON CHILDREN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. AMMAN 2222 </p><p> </p><p>     B. USUN 1154 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA Gregory L. Berry for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Responding to our earlier demarche (ref a), Acting </p><p>Foreign Minister Shaher Bak told the Charge and PolCouns May </p><p>8 that Jordan does not want the UN Special Session on </p><p>Children to be "hijacked" by radical language from the Arab </p><p>Group.  He said that PM Ali Abul Ragheb had instructed the </p><p>head of Jordan\'s delegation, Social Development Minister </p><p>Taman al-Ghul, to moderate the language of the conference and </p><p>keep the session focused on children\'s issues to the extent </p><p>possible.  He said, however, that if there was "unanimous </p><p>agreement" from other members of the Arab group on insertion </p><p>of language about the plight of Palestinian children, there </p><p>would be nothing Jordan could do to oppose it. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Bak suggested that the U.S. ask key European </p><p>countries to approach Arab Group members and argue against </p><p>inclusion of such language.  Coming from the Europeans, Bak </p><p>argued, such a message would have greater impact.  Such </p><p>European action, Bak concluded, might help Jordan to moderate </p><p>Arab Group language.  He promised that he would stay in touch </p><p>with delegation leader al-Ghul throughout the conference, and </p><p>said the Jordanian delegation would be willing to work with </p><p>the U.S. delegation to produce a positive outcome. </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
