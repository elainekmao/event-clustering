<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 KUWAIT 003402 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR INR/R/MR, NEA/ARP, NEA/PPD, PA, INR/NESA, </p><p>IIP/G/NEA-SA, INR/B </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESS OFFICE </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH, PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>CINCCENT FOR CCPA </p><p>USDOC FOR 4520/ANESA/ONE/FITZGERALD-WILKS </p><p>USDOC FOR ITA AND PTO/OLIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KU, KDMR </p><p>SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION, JULY 26-28: ISLAMIC </p><p>CHARITIES; DEATHS OF UDAY AND QUSAY HUSSEIN; IRAQI WMD </p><p> </p><p>1.   SUMMARY: All newspapers report government initiatives </p><p>to oversee Islamic charitable donations, including formation </p><p>of a joint committee to "inspect" charitable organizations </p><p>and a proposed ministerial department to monitor Shiia </p><p>charitable funds, leading to denunciations by Shiia MPs. One </p><p>liberal commentator blames "governmental mismanagement and </p><p>the absence of monitoring" for the diversion of funds to </p><p>terrorist organizations. </p><p> </p><p>On Iraq, reaction to the deaths of Uday and Qusay is </p><p>predictably positive, although one commentator criticizes US </p><p>forces for allowing Saddam\'s wife and former Minister of </p><p>Information Mohammad Al-Sahaf to remain free.  A noted </p><p>liberal says that the fact that President Bush and PM Blair </p><p>are facing heat on the Iraqi WMD issue is a positive example </p><p>of how US and British leaders are held to account by their </p><p>people. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.   News Stories: Minister of Interior Sheikh Nawaf Al- </p><p>Ahamd denied that there are Kuwaitis among the nineteen </p><p>persons apprehended recently in Saudi Arabia for suspicion </p><p>of carrying out terrorist acts. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassah reports that the new Minister of Awqaf and </p><p>Islamic Affairs, Abdullah Al-Matouq, is considering </p><p>establishment of a Shiia department at the Ministry to </p><p>monitor Shiia funds and donations. Al-Matouq stated that </p><p>"it is vital to have bodies to organize collection and </p><p>spending of Awqaf funds and donations to keep these </p><p>activities beyond suspicion." Shiia MPs accuse the Minister </p><p>of harboring "bad intentions" against the Shiia, Al-Seyassah </p><p>reports. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Qabas reports that an official source at the Ministry of </p><p>Labor and Social Affairs stated that the Ministry has </p><p>contacted the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Commerce </p><p>and the Kuwait City Municipality in order to form a </p><p>committee to inspect the work of charitable organizations. </p><p> </p><p>Al-Seyassah reports on July 28 that the government called on </p><p>the Ministry of Labor and Social affairs to remove all </p><p>unlicensed charity booths in Kuwait </p><p> </p><p>Al-Watan reports that a conservative MP, Jassim Al-Kandari, </p><p>has reiterated opposition to granting women their political </p><p>rights by warning against "submission to any foreign </p><p>intervention, especially American pressure." </p><p> </p><p>The Assistant Undersecretary for Scholarship at the Ministry </p><p>of Higher Education Ahmad Al-Duwaisan responding in Al-Qabas </p><p>to criticism of US student visa procedures stated that, "The </p><p>Ministry fully understands the security situation of each </p><p>country. and [the US Embassy] has denied only a limited </p><p>number of applicants due to specific reasons." </p><p> </p><p>Editorials: </p><p> </p><p>3.  "Kuwait, Enjoy the Occasion" </p><p>Waleed Al-Jassim wrote in independent Al-Watan (7/26): </p><p>"Kuwait, you have the right to enjoy the deaths of Udai and </p><p>Qusai. Four months after their escape from one den to </p><p>another in women\'s clothes, they were finally killed. Now, </p><p>the journey is over and the allied forces succeeded in </p><p>chopping off Saddam\'s wings. If Saddam is lucky, he will end </p><p>up. running and hiding from one place to another. The other </p><p>option, which most people wish, is see him in custody and </p><p>put on trial for all the crimes he has committed." </p><p> </p><p>4.  Nabil Al-Fadel wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam </p><p>(7/26):  "It is acceptable for the American forces to kill </p><p>Udai and Qusai for what they did to the Iraqi people. </p><p>However, we cannot understand why American forces leave </p><p>Saddam\'s wife and daughters free despite knowing their </p><p>whereabouts. It is not also acceptable to allow [former </p><p>Minister of Information Mohammad] Al-Sahaf to leave Iraq, </p><p>knowing that he defended Saddam\'s regime. Allowing Al-Sahaf </p><p>to remain free is not fair to the Iraqi people because it </p><p>encourages supporters of Saddam\'s regime to continue the </p><p>struggle against [coalition] forces in Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>5.  "Financing Terrorism" </p><p>Dr. Shamlan Al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (7/27): </p><p>"We cannot rule out the possibility that [terrorists] </p><p>exploit governmental mismanagement and the absence of </p><p>monitoring to finance the young generation who volunteer to </p><p>fight abroad. In other words, some governments, political </p><p>movements, charitable organizations and religious movements </p><p>which work under various covers contribute in the financing </p><p>of terrorism." </p><p> </p><p>6.  "Iraq and the Upcoming Danger" </p><p>Mubarak Al-Hajiri wrote in independent Al-Watan (7/26): </p><p>"Wherever you go, you keep hearing about the failure of </p><p>America in Iraq. Personally, I do not see any American </p><p>failure in Iraq, despite the daily human losses there. On </p><p>the contrary, I believe that the coalition forces have </p><p>succeeded in achieving their objectives. [However] any </p><p>success will not be achieved without the support of the </p><p>Iraqis themselves. Unless the coalition forces find a </p><p>political solution to that which Iraq suffers from, the </p><p>danger will remain." </p><p> </p><p>7.  "America\'s Milking Cow" </p><p>Dr. Sami Khalifa wrote in independent Al-Rai Al-Aam (7/26): </p><p>"America\'s interests are only based on shallow self- </p><p>interest. [which] has made the American administration act </p><p>in such a way as both small and great nations must follow </p><p>the will of the US or face economic or political sanctions. </p><p>The US has based its policies. on discrimination according </p><p>to color, religion and cultures." </p><p> </p><p>8.  "Arabs and Iraq" </p><p>Dr. Shamlan al-Essa wrote in independent Al-Seyassah (7/28): </p><p>"Arab intellectuals who criticize the coalition are </p><p>demanding the establishment of a democratic system in Iraq </p><p>that is based on freedom and justice among all parties, but </p><p>how many Arab countries have a real democratic regime? We </p><p>are very confused by the Arabs because they are demanding </p><p>Iraq\'s sovereignty and at the same time demand the departure </p><p>of coalition forces from Iraq. There is no doubt that this </p><p>would cause a civil war in Iraq. I tell the Arabs to be </p><p>merciful with us and with the people of Iraq, because Iraq </p><p>needs stability and security now. What the coalition forces </p><p>are doing in Iraq now is correct and the reconstruction of </p><p>Iraq will take time, so please keep your hands out of Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>9.  "Great Nations" </p><p>Dr. Ahmad Al-Baghdadi wrote in independent Al-Seyassah </p><p>(7/28): "The great victory of the US and Britain in Iraq did </p><p>not protect Bush and Blair, because they did not tell the </p><p>truth about the reasons behind sending their armies to Iraq. </p><p>The weapon inspectors have not found [WMD] in Iraq since the </p><p>end of the war, meaning that Bush and Blair lied to their </p><p>people and may end up paying dearly by losing in the next </p><p>elections. Great people, like the people of America and </p><p>Britain, are not concerned about the personal lives of their </p><p>leaders, but they are concerned about honesty. Such ethics </p><p>and the accountability of officials is what made them great </p><p>nations, and this is the difference between them and us." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
