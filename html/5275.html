<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000553 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/SE, EB/TRA </p><p>ROME FOR FAA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ASEC, ATRN, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH RESPONSE TO FAA REQUEST FOR CONSULTATIONS </p><p>ON AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 7574 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This cable contains an action request.  See paras 2 </p><p>and 8. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Summary and action request.  EconCouns delivered </p><p>reftel points to senior GOT officials January 21-22.  The </p><p>Director General of the Civil Aviation Authority (DGCA) </p><p>acknowledged that the DGCA had not yet implemented all the </p><p>recommendations in the 2001 ICAO report, but emphasized that </p><p>he was now working hard to do so in the coming months.  He </p><p>noted that the DGCA was also working to prepare for the March </p><p>5 ICAO audit, and requested that FAA schedule its </p><p>consultations after March.  Post requests that FAA propose a </p><p>way forward to the GOT given their concerns, and that FAA </p><p>consider providing the DGCA with informal assistance and/or </p><p>training prior to the March 5 ICAO audit.  End summary and </p><p>action request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) EconCouns and econoff delivered reftel points to GOT </p><p>officials January 21-22, including:  Director General of the </p><p>Civil Aviation Authority (DGCA) Serdar Cebeci, Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs Deputy Director General for Aviation Vakur </p><p>Gokdenizler, and Ministry of Transportation Deputy </p><p>Undersecretary Tahir Dengiz.  DG Cebeci acknowledged that the </p><p>DGCA was still working on implementing the recommendations of </p><p>the 2001 ICAO report.  He emphasized that he was personally </p><p>committed to resolving all outstanding issues related to </p><p>safety oversight procedures, and that he had made this point </p><p>several times to various FAA officials. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Cebeci noted that, although the DGCA had received </p><p>the ICAO report well over a year ago, the "political </p><p>situation" as well as his taking over as DG had slowed down </p><p>the reform process.  Still, he said, serious efforts were </p><p>underway to address the ICAO concerns.  New legislation </p><p>proposing changes to the civil aviation code was currently </p><p>pending in Parliament.  Cebeci said this legislation would </p><p>resolve all the remaining problems, but it may not pass until </p><p>summer given that the Parliament was new. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Cebeci told EconCouns he was "very disappointed" by </p><p>the tone of reftel points, which he perceived to be a threat. </p><p> He said he understood from previous conversations with FAA </p><p>officials that FAA was willing to offer "informal </p><p>consultations and training" to help the DGCA prepare for the </p><p>March 2003 ICAO audit.  However, he said, FAA now seemed to </p><p>be proposing its own audit, which could result in an IASA </p><p>reassessment taking place within strict time deadlines. </p><p>EconCouns emphasized that the points were not meant to be </p><p>threatening; rather, he believed it was FAA\'s intention to </p><p>engage the GOT in order to resolve the outstanding safety </p><p>oversight issues as soon as possible in a manner that would </p><p>benefit both the United States and Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Although clearly disturbed by the timing, Cebeci </p><p>admitted that the FAA "was right" in pursuing the concerns </p><p>raised by the ICAO, noting that U.S. pressure would help him </p><p>move the government to accomplish the tasks at hand.  Cebeci </p><p>noted that the ICAO audit had been moved up to March 5; </p><p>therefore, the DGCA would be extremely busy in the next </p><p>several months preparing for that visit.  He suggested that </p><p>the FAA wait to see the results of the ICAO audit rather than </p><p>performing its own review.  If, however, FAA insisted on </p><p>scheduling consultations now, late April or May 2003 would be </p><p>better for the GOT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Ministry of Transportation Deputy U/S Dengiz echoed </p><p>Cebeci\'s comments, stating that the GOT would prefer to </p><p>schedule the FAA consultations after the ICAO visit in March. </p><p> He emphasized that the GOT was working hard to meet the </p><p>recommendations in the ICAO report, noting that most of the </p><p>deficiencies had already been corrected, or would be by </p><p>end-March.  The one pending item was the new civil aviation </p><p>code, which was pending with the new parliament.  MFA Deputy </p><p>DG Gokdenizler, while deferring to DGCA on timing, also </p><p>indicated a preference for scheduling the consultations after </p><p>March. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Comment and action request:  Post supports moving </p><p>ahead.  As Director General Cebeci admits, the DGCA has had </p><p>the ICAO recommendations for almost two years and still has </p><p>not resolved all of the ICAO concerns.  On the other hand, we </p><p>think a bit of flexibility on timing makes sense, given the </p><p>apparently sincere GOT efforts underway to address the </p><p>problems.  It would have been useful to pursue the informal </p><p>advice Cebeci had been led to expect.  It could be, however, </p><p>counter-productive to overload the DGCA in the run-up to the </p><p>March ICAO inspection.  Post requests that FAA propose a way </p><p>forward to the GOT given their concerns.  Further, post </p><p>recommends that FAA consider whether it would be possible to </p><p>provide the DGCA with informal training and/or assistance </p><p>prior to the March 5 ICAO audit.  End comment and action </p><p>request. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
