There remains considerable political support for a </p><p>mandatory labeling scheme by many Liberal party </p><p>backbench Members of Parliament.  This fact, coupled </p><p>with the news that the effort to produce a voluntary </p><p>biotech labeling standard is moribund may lead to a </p><p>recrudescence of the issue and new pressure for </p><p>government mandated action.  But an about face in </p><p>Canadian government policy is unlikely since the PM and </p><p>his cabinet continue to support voluntary, rather than </p><p>mandatory, labeling. End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Government and Parliamentary Activity </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. Prime Minister Chrtien, his senior advisors and the </p><p>members of the Cabinet (in particular the ministers of </p><p>Health, Agriculture and Industry) support voluntary </p><p>labeling.  They remain engaged on this file and are </p><p>aware of USG concerns and implications of divergent </p><p>labeling policies.  Despite the Cabinet agreement on </p><p>this issue, there remains significant support for </p><p>mandatory labeling among the rank and file members of </p><p>the Liberal caucus.  (Ref A) </p><p> </p><p>3. Indeed, another mandatory labeling bill (Bill C-220) </p><p>was introduced in the House of Commons in October 2002. </p><p>A reincarnation of Charles Caccia\'s Bill C-287, which </p><p>caused so much concern in autumn 2001 (Ref B), the bill </p><p>was spiked when it passed through a government- </p><p>controlled committee in parliament who decided it did </p><p>not meet the criteria to be eligible for a vote in </p><p>parliament (among other things, it would have had to </p><p>have been a revenue neutral proposition and not </p><p>disruptive to reigning government policy).  This bill </p><p>cannot be resubmitted for the rest of this </p><p>parliamentary session (which will conclude only at the </p><p>next election probably about 24 months from now). </p><p> </p><p>4. With respect to parliamentary committee action, the </p><p>House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture and </p><p>Agri-food released its report examining the impact of </p><p>mandatory and/or voluntary labeling of transgenic foods </p><p>on farmers and the agri-food industry in June 2002. </p><p>The brief report\'s four recommendations support the </p><p>maintenance of a voluntary labeling approach toward </p><p>biotech foods (Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>5. The Standing Committee on Health, however, which had </p><p>the initial ministerial mandate to study this issue, </p><p>had suspended its investigation into this matter in mid- </p><p>April 2002 due to other more pressing commitments.  The </p><p>Committee recommenced its study on March 26, 2003. The </p><p>Health committee has been less receptive to the </p><p>voluntary approach.  Its final report (due possibly </p><p>before the Codex Committee on Food Labeling in Ottawa </p><p>in May) will likely be less consistent with the USG </p><p>position than the Agriculture Committee report. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Voluntary labeling standard appears moribund </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. The government has from the start hoped that a </p><p>voluntary standard developed by a broad array of </p><p>stakeholders will serve to diffuse the pressure for </p><p>mandatory labeling found among many the rank and file </p><p>Liberal members of parliament.  The voluntary labeling </p><p>initiative has, however, been a slow and unsteady </p><p>process.  And things continue to unravel in the three </p><p>and a half year old process, which was anticipated to </p><p>require only 18 months to conclude (it began in </p><p>September 1999). </p><p> </p><p>7. Doryne Peace, chairwoman of the Canadian General </p><p>Standards Board (CGSB) committee on voluntary labeling </p><p>has warned that her committee may have to throw in the </p><p>towel for lack of progress.  Consensus on the proposed </p><p>standard has not been achieved and no party is willing </p><p>to budge from their entrenched positions to accommodate </p><p>a successful resolution to the impasse. </p><p> </p><p>8. Observers agree that a failure of the voluntary </p><p>standard effort will likely reinvigorate the effort </p><p>within the backbench ranks of the Liberal caucus to </p><p>establish a mandatory labeling law, nevertheless every </p><p>indication is that the government will continue to </p><p>oppose a mandatory labeling policy. </p><p> </p><p>Cellucci </p><p></p></div>
