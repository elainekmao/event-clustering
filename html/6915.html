On 27 March, the DART, with assistance from Coalition </p><p>forces, conducted an assessment of the food, water, and </p><p>health situation in Umm Qasr.  With regard to the Coalition </p><p>military presence in Umm Qasr, the DART was impressed by the </p><p>priority being placed on providing security to the </p><p>community, involving the community in security and </p><p>assistance decisions, and respecting the local population\'s </p><p>desire to help themselves.  While there are no urgent, life- </p><p>threatening needs at the moment, the population of Umm Qasr </p><p>is lacking protein-rich food and is dependant on water </p><p>distributions.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>OVERVIEW </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  Although the atmosphere in Umm Qasr is marked by </p><p>wariness, by the afternoon, people were out on the streets. </p><p>The Coalition forces report that trust is improving daily, </p><p>but it is obvious that the community, with the events of </p><p>1991 in clear memory, is waiting for proof that the regime </p><p>is, in fact, finished. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>SECURITY AND ACCESS </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  The DART was repeatedly assured by Coalition forces that </p><p>security in Umm Qasr was under control and a humanitarian </p><p>presence was welcomed by the military.  However, presently </p><p>there is no means to coordinate humanitarian assistance from </p><p>Kuwait City at the Kuwait - Iraq border.  This issue needs </p><p>to be addressed immediately. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>PORT </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>4.  Heavy silting was visible in an aerial photograph of the </p><p>New Port waterway.  Two dredgers were located that, while </p><p>not seriously damaged, are currently inoperable.  However, </p><p>parts appear to be available on site and repairs are </p><p>underway.  Lack of dredgers will not affect the arrival of </p><p>the Sir Galahad, which has a shallow draft.  The Sir Galahad </p><p>is scheduled to arrive on 28 March following a one-day delay </p><p>due to the discovery of mines in the waterway at the lower </p><p>end of the Old Port.  The ship is carrying approximately 230 </p><p>metric tons of food and nonfood commodities. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Two back-up generators appear to be of sufficient power </p><p>to establish a separate electrical grid for the entire port. </p><p>They are not yet operational, due to a lack of ignition </p><p>capability.  The Coalition forces are working to resolve the </p><p>issue. </p><p> </p><p>6.  There are five mobile vacuators at the port.  The main </p><p>(silo) vacuator appears undamaged.  Two appear to be </p><p>inoperable, but the remainder appear to have been used </p><p>within the past few weeks.  They are diesel operated and as </p><p>of 27 March have not been operated. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The approximately 24 port silos have been swept for </p><p>mines and are reportedly empty.  The warehouses have also </p><p>been swept and reported to be empty with the exception of </p><p>approximately 200 bags of sugar and salt. </p><p> </p><p>---- </p><p>FOOD </p><p>---- </p><p> </p><p>8.  Despite the frenzy that accompanied Kuwaiti </p><p>distributions in Safwan on 26 March, Coalition forces and </p><p>local residents report that food is not an urgent need at </p><p>this time.  Households reportedly have up to six-month </p><p>stores of staple commodities (flour/rice).  However, there </p><p>is a need for canned meat.  The Coalition forces described </p><p>Umm Qasr\'s population as "protein-starved". </p><p> </p><p>9.  Kuwaiti food boxes delivered to Umm Qasr were warehoused </p><p>by the Coalition forces.  They have worked to establish an </p><p>organized community-based distribution process, entailing </p><p>one community representative from each of Umm Qasr\'s 85 </p><p>neighborhoods.  The representatives will collect food and </p><p>distribute it in their specific blocks.  The Coalition </p><p>forces are working closely with four community leaders, </p><p>including a schoolteacher and the hospital\'s medical </p><p>director.  It is hoped that this system might provide a more </p><p>accurate head count in the town.  If the 85 community heads </p><p>represent the entire town, then there would be between 470 </p><p>and 530 people living in each, if the total population of </p><p>Umm Qasr is between 45,000 to 50,000, as has been reported </p><p>to the Coalition forces. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Forty Public Distribution System (PDS) agents are </p><p>reported to have either fled Umm Qasr, or are laying low. </p><p>The DART was unable to obtain community-level verification </p><p>of the status of the PDS agents.  The Coalition forces have </p><p>been told that the distribution agents were members of the </p><p>Baath Party and not trusted by the population.  It is not </p><p>clear if community distrust applies to all agents, but the </p><p>Coalition forces indicated that they were not pursuing the </p><p>re-establishment of the PDS system. </p><p> </p><p>11.  The Coalition forces have supplied water to town </p><p>residents for the past two days via two mobile tankers, </p><p>which drive to different parts of the city for distribution. </p><p>Bottled water is opened prior to distribution to limit the </p><p>possibility that it is re-sold.  The Coalition forces appear </p><p>willing to continue water distributions until the pipeline </p><p>is turned on, but welcomed the possibility of tankers </p><p>organized by UNICEF taking over until the water pipeline </p><p>comes on line. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  A preliminary health assessment of the hospital in the </p><p>town of Umm Qasr revealed adequate pharmaceutical stocks for </p><p>three months, with the exception of medicines for certain </p><p>chronic care diseases.  Patients who need more treatment are </p><p>referred elsewhere. The hospital sees approximately 10 </p><p>malnourished children each week, although the staff did not </p><p>specify their diagnosis criteria.  While the severe </p><p>malnutrition cases are referred to Basra, moderate or mild </p><p>cases are treated with commercial infant formula.  At the </p><p>time of the DART visit, there were four inpatients, two </p><p>recovering from war-wounds.  Of the seven doctors at the </p><p>hospital, only four remain. Similarly, 45 of the 70 nurses </p><p>are still at the hospital.  The facility is dirty, poorly </p><p>equipped, and operating off a generator.  The hospital staff </p><p>requested protein-enhanced canned food.  The administrator </p><p>seemed to be caught between the need to reinforce the </p><p>regime\'s assertion that three months\' medical stores had </p><p>been provided and the desire to wait two to three weeks to </p><p>let things settle down before putting together a list of the </p><p>hospital\'s needs. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>ELECTRICITY </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>13.  There are several large generators in Umm Qasr town, </p><p>which combined with the generators at the port, may be </p><p>sufficient to provide electricity to most of the town, </p><p>according to the Coalition forces.  The town\'s main power </p><p>source is Umm Qasr, but residents reported a deterioration </p><p>of service in past months.  There is evidence that many </p><p>residents are hooked into existing generators, but the </p><p>Coalition forces say they will not know the coverage until </p><p>the generators are turned on.  The main hospital has a </p><p>functioning generator, and the Coalition forces reported </p><p>that there has not been a request for fuel from the </p><p>hospital. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SCHOOLS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  At least 23 schools (18 primary) exist in Umm Qasr. </p><p>Many were being used for storage, and the Coalition forces </p><p>are in the process of clearing out large amounts of </p><p>ordinance.  Community leaders are being encouraged to re- </p><p>open schools as they are cleared. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>PROTECTION </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  General unrest after the fighting in Umm Qasr was </p><p>dominated by looting of government and regime supporter </p><p>properties.  The Coalition forces believe that </p><p>revenge/retribution beatings and killings are probably </p><p>occurring, although no physical evidence has yet been </p><p>encountered.  Baath Party members have been arrested and/or </p><p>are surrendering to the Coalition forces.  The hospital </p><p>director either did not understand the protection questions </p><p>being put to him or did not feel comfortable discussing the </p><p>subject. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>CONCLUSIONS </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>16.  The DART identified the following challenges for </p><p>providing humanitarian assistance in Umm Qasr: shortage of </p><p>local interpreters, especially female; reaching vulnerable </p><p>populations; ensuring proper representation in </p><p>leadership/contacts; establishing a new system/staff for </p><p>World Food Program distribution; managing a possible </p><p>migration from Basra if distribution begins in Um Qasr and </p><p>people able to leave Basra. </p><p> </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
