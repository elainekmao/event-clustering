<p>S E C R E T ANKARA 008639 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FOR NEA/NGA AND EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/26/2012 </p><p>TAGS: OREP, ASEC, AFIN, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: NORTHERN IRAQ:  TURKS GIVE CONDITIONAL "GREEN </p><p>LIGHT" TO CODEL BIDEN\'S REQUEST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 8638 B) STATE 241093 C) ANKARA 7563 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. </p><p>Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 4. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) MFA DG for Middle Eastern Affairs Burcuoglu notified </p><p>DCM November 26 that the GOT had approved Codel Biden\'s </p><p>request to travel to northern Iraq via Turkey December 4-5 </p><p>(refs a-b).  However, given the Ramadan holiday (December 4 </p><p>at 1300 through December 7), Burcuoglu said that appropriate </p><p>GOT officials would not be available to meet with the Codel </p><p>December 6 upon its return from northern Iraq.  Burcuoglu </p><p>stressed the importance the GOT attaches to meeting with </p><p>visiting USG officials and Codels, and expressed hope the </p><p>Codel could adjust its schedule to arrive in Ankara in time </p><p>to meet with GOT officials December 4 in the morning (before </p><p>the start of the holiday.)  Despite the busy schedule that </p><p>day (UK FM Straw, Greek FM Papendreau, other USD </p><p>distinguished visitors), Burcuoglu said they would arrange </p><p>appropriate meetings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Burcuoglu reminded the DCM of the preconditions </p><p>attached to the GOT\'s approval for Staffdel Talwar to travel </p><p>to northern Iraq via Turkey in October -- one-time deal and </p><p>no publicity (ref b) -- and said these conditions still </p><p>applied.  Recognizing that it would be difficult to avoid </p><p>publicity given the Codel\'s visibility, Burcuoglu expressed </p><p>hope that the visit could be handled in such as a way as to </p><p>avoid negative reactions in the Turkish press and additional </p><p>requests to travel to northern Iraq via Turkey by other US </p><p>and European VIPs or interested individuals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Action request:  Embassy requests that the Department </p><p>advise Codel Biden of the "conditions" that the MFA attached </p><p>to its approval for the visit (i.e. one-time deal and no </p><p>publicity).  Embassy also asks that the Department inform the </p><p>Codel that GOT officials would only be available December 4 </p><p>in the morning.  We believe it is important for the Senators </p><p>to hold these meetings.  If the Codel concurs, the Embassy </p><p>will officially request appointments with appropriate GOT </p><p>officials. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
