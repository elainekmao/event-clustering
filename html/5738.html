<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 AMMAN 000980 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PGOV, PREL, ASEC, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PILLARS OF THE REGIME PART III OF IV: JORDAN\'S </p><p>ARMED FORCES AND SECURITY SERVICES </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) As Jordan prepares to face a possible war on its </p><p>Eastern border, and then looks beyond the immediate crisis to </p><p>longer term challenges, the Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF), </p><p>General Intelligence Directorate (GID) and Public Security </p><p>Directorate (PSD) will serve as key pillars ensuring the </p><p>stability of the monarchy.  Throughout its modern history, </p><p>Jordan\'s military and internal security services -- drawn </p><p>predominantly from its East Bank and Circassian populations </p><p>-- have been a loyal and dependable source of support </p><p>countering any threats to the regime, whether from within or </p><p>without.  While the immediate and looming crisis with Iraq </p><p>will test the strength and cohesiveness of these </p><p>institutions, we expect that they will rise to the occasion </p><p>-- as they have during every previous crisis in the nation\'s </p><p>history.  Over the longer term, the GOJ will face potential </p><p>stresses on these pillars from government reforms, economic </p><p>changes and social pressures.   End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Always There When It Counts </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Throughout Jordan\'s modern history, the Hashemite </p><p>Monarchy has depended on its military, intelligence and </p><p>security forces to protect the kingdom from external threats, </p><p>to infiltrate groups before they could act on their </p><p>anti-regime ambitions and to maintain order when popular </p><p>passions threatened to boil over.  At each critical juncture </p><p>in Jordan\'s recent -- and not so recent -- past, these </p><p>pillars have protected the stability of the Kingdom and </p><p>guaranteed the continued rule of the Hashemites. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Over the past several years, with increased Al-Qaeda </p><p>activity in Jordan, a public inflamed by the Intifada next </p><p>door, and now a war with Iraq looking ever more probable, the </p><p>preparedness and effectiveness of all three of these </p><p>organizations -- the GID, JAF and PSD -- have never been more </p><p>critical. </p><p> </p><p>--- </p><p>GID </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) The GID is undoubtedly the most powerful of these </p><p>three key organizations -- in the eyes of most Jordanians, </p><p>the real "power behind the throne."  The GID maintains a </p><p>mystique among the general population as the institution that </p><p>"knows where all the skeletons are hidden."  Responsible both </p><p>for internal and external intelligence, the GID\'s presence </p><p>can be found in all corners of society.  Traditionally, </p><p>Jordan\'s small but very Hashemite-loyal Circassian minority </p><p>has played an outsized role in the organization, along with </p><p>other East Bankers.  The GID has always been well-funded, </p><p>something that has allowed it to successfully recruit many of </p><p>the country\'s best and brightest into its service.  Family </p><p>tradition also serves as a strong motivating force for </p><p>service.  The GID\'s influence, always substantial under King </p><p>Hussein, has grown even stronger since the accession to power </p><p>of King Abdullah.  Its present Director, General Sa\'ad Kheir, </p><p>is arguably the King\'s closest advisor and confidant.  Using </p><p>an array of sophisticated tools and methods, the GID keeps </p><p>close tabs on groups and individuals that may pose threats to </p><p>the regime. </p><p> </p><p>--- </p><p>JAF </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The present-day JAF is a direct descendent of the </p><p>legendary Arab Legion, and officers and enlisted soldiers </p><p>alike who serve in the nation\'s armed forces are proud of </p><p>this lineage.  Like the GID, the vast majority of Jordan\'s </p><p>armed forces are East Bankers.  Entering the JAF or the RJAF </p><p>(Royal Jordanian Air Force) is seen as a career commitment, </p><p>with most soldiers and airmen serving twenty-year stints. </p><p>For many East Bankers of modest backgrounds, getting into the </p><p>military has been, and continues to be, seen as an </p><p>opportunity to gain steady employment, learn marketable </p><p>skills, access the networks of "wasta" (connections) that are </p><p>crucial in Jordanian society, serve their country, and -- for </p><p>some -- be sent to the U.S. for training.  The primary </p><p>mission of the armed forces is to protect the Kingdom\'s </p><p>borders, whether from an invading army or from individuals </p><p>and groups that would seek to use Jordan to smuggle weapons </p><p>or drugs, or engage in acts of terror.  On those few </p><p>occasions when unrest has turned bad -- such as the Black </p><p>September civil war or (on a much smaller scale) unrest in </p><p>Ma\'an in late 2002 -- the JAF has been called in to assist </p><p>police in restoring order. </p><p> </p><p>--- </p><p>PSD </p><p>--- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The PSD is among the most professional and competent </p><p>police forces in the Arab world.  The PSD\'s responsibilities </p><p>include investigating crimes; protecting the Royal Family, </p><p>senior government officials, foreign diplomats and other </p><p>dignitaries; border crossing point security; and -- the one </p><p>with the greatest potential for internal political </p><p>repercussions -- crowd control and suppression of civil </p><p>disturbances.  Drawing almost exclusively from Jordan\'s East </p><p>Bank populations, the PSD -- like the GID and JAF -- has long </p><p>been seen as an avenue of opportunity for young men </p><p>(primarily) from modest backgrounds to serve their country </p><p>and provide reliable income for their families. Under the </p><p>leadership of its current Director, former JAF Lt. General </p><p>(and U.S. Army Ranger-trained) Tahseen Shurdom, the PSD has </p><p>embarked on a coordinated effort to upgrade its training and </p><p>technological capabilities (much of it supported through the </p><p>DOS\'s Anti Terrorism Assistance (ATA) program).  General </p><p>Shurdom is not the only military general to join PSD\'s ranks </p><p>recently.  There is a clear desire to infuse PSD with </p><p>military quality training and discipline for the events </p><p>coming soon. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>The Immediate Challenges Ahead </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) The possible war with Iraq will provide an immediate </p><p>test of the capabilities and loyalty of these three key </p><p>organizations.  While there are clear differences in the </p><p>missions of each, they would be united in carrying out GOJ </p><p>policies that -- at least in the beginning -- would not be </p><p>popular with many Jordanians seeking to demonstrate pan-Arab </p><p>solidarity with Iraq.  That said, if coalition forces are </p><p>welcomed as liberators in Baghdad and relatively little blood </p><p>is spilled, this initial burst of pro-Iraqi sentiment may </p><p>lose much of its anti-American flavor and could transform </p><p>into something potentially positive.  If, however, military </p><p>action results in prolonged combat and high numbers of Iraqi </p><p>civilian casualties -- and Jordanians see their government as </p><p>complicit in this action -- the potential for anti-American, </p><p>and possibly anti-Hashemite, popular unrest could grow </p><p>appreciably.  The GOJ leadership fears that such an outcome </p><p>-- coinciding with a spike in the Israeli-Palestinian </p><p>conflict and/or acts of violence perpetrated by Iraqi agents </p><p>or al-Qaeda inside Jordan -- could pose challenges of a </p><p>unique magnitude for the state. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  While various "nightmare" scenarios can be </p><p>envisioned, the behavior of the security forces over the past </p><p>2 1/2 years provide some indication of their current state of </p><p>readiness.  Since the Intifada began in September 2000, the </p><p>PSD has improved its crowd control techniques, recruited over </p><p>1,200 new riot control police officers and, except in a </p><p>limited number of occasions, been able to avoid the use of </p><p>force to maintain order.  The PSD would seek to use this </p><p>experience to defuse situations before they result either in </p><p>violent confrontations with demonstrators or, equally as bad, </p><p>the unwillingness of its forces to confront mobs.  Until now, </p><p>PSD cohesion has been firm, even in the face of difficult </p><p>situations. </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) For example, in April 2002, following the IDF\'s </p><p>assault on Jenin, the fiercely loyal Badia police were </p><p>deployed in Amman to prevent large-scale demonstrations.  The </p><p>Badia\'s presence was a clear signal to protest organizers </p><p>"not to cross red lines" and proved an effective deterrent to </p><p>large rallies.  Even though the vast majority of Jordanians </p><p>(and probably security officers themselves) agreed with most </p><p>of the protest organizers\' views, planned actions to "march </p><p>to the Israeli Embassy and burn it down" were canceled and </p><p>the most virulent calls by opposition groups dissipated </p><p>significantly soon thereafter. The November 2002 standoff in </p><p>Ma\'an with Salafist Islamic extremists provided another test </p><p>of the PSD\'s readiness to protect the regime.  While there </p><p>has been criticism of the GOJ\'s handling of this situation </p><p>(specifically that the PSD\'s approach, in this case, was too </p><p>confrontational), the PSD did what was asked of it by the </p><p>political leadership.  PSD was actively supported by JAF and </p><p>RJAF forces in Ma\'an. </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) The JAF, in the immediate period ahead, will be </p><p>focused on protecting Jordan\'s borders, responding to any </p><p>humanitarian crisis that might arise should there be an </p><p>influx of Iraqi refugees, and if required, bolstering the PSD </p><p>to ensure calm and order within the Kingdom.  The JAF has </p><p>earmarked the entire special operations command for </p><p>suppression of possible internal turbulence in Amman and </p><p>Zarqa.  The King, PM, FM and other senior GOJ officials have </p><p>repeatedly told the Jordanian public that the JAF will not be </p><p>involved in any military action against Iraq. While there </p><p>have been reports of lower level JAF personnel airing </p><p>personal views sometimes sympathetic to Saddam or even Bin </p><p>Laden, there is no indication that this has become widespread </p><p>or problematic for JAF operations.  That said, soldiers in </p><p>the JAF are not immune to the sentiments of frustration with </p><p>U.S. policy prevalent in Jordanian society as a whole. </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) While the GID\'s immediate tasks are formidable, many </p><p>of the threats that it is working to root out have foreign </p><p>connections, a factor that makes it less likely to have </p><p>domestic political ramifications.  Going after Iraqi agents </p><p>and Al-Qaeda cells who would seek to commit acts of violence </p><p>and destabilize the Kingdom is something most Jordanians see </p><p>as fully justifiable. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Over The Longer Term </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12. (C) Assuming the GID, JAF and PSD handle the near-term </p><p>challenges successfully, all three institutions (but </p><p>particularly the JAF and PSD) will still face longer term </p><p>structural issues in the years ahead.  On a philosophical </p><p>level, there is the question of how, or if, more Jordanians </p><p>of Palestinian origin can be incorporated into these </p><p>organizations.  Memories of "Black September" in 1970 and </p><p>questions of loyalty still deter the GOJ from allowing </p><p>significant numbers of Palestinians to serve in sensitive </p><p>positions.  It is likely that until some solution is found to </p><p>the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Jordan will be unable to </p><p>resolve its own internal tensions between East and West </p><p>Bankers and the ethnic makeup of these institutions will </p><p>remain essentially unchanged. </p><p> </p><p>13. (C)  On a more concrete level are questions of salaries, </p><p>expertise and talent.   Given the limited job opportunities </p><p>for young Jordanians in provincial East Bank communities, the </p><p>numbers seeking entrance into the military or PSD greatly </p><p>outstrips available slots.  In an average year, for instance, </p><p>18,000 Jordanians will apply to fill the roughly 2,000 new </p><p>available slots in the JAF.  Typically, meritocratic criteria </p><p>have played a less important role in the selection process </p><p>than tribal or other "wasta" factors.  These patterns, which </p><p>may have been acceptable in the past, will prove more </p><p>problematic as the JAF (in particular) becomes a more </p><p>technology-based force that demands selection more on </p><p>qualifications than on connections. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) A related issue concerns the JAF\'s ability to attract </p><p>and retain individuals with high-tech aptitudes and skills to </p><p>a military career at low pay when such skills will be in high </p><p>demand at better pay in the private sector.  As it currently </p><p>stands, the majority of career soldiers earn very modest </p><p>incomes.  Army Captains, for instance, earn about 208 JD (USD </p><p>291) per month.  (Note: Jordanian soldiers earn substantially </p><p>more when serving overseas in international peacekeeping </p><p>operations, an important factor in the GOJ\'s strong support </p><p>and involvement in such missions.  End Note.)  The PSD will </p><p>face similar issues as it too has embarked on an ambitious </p><p>program to upgrade the technological component of its work. </p><p>The GID, because of its traditionally higher salaries, faces </p><p>less pressures from this direction. </p><p> </p><p>15. (C)  Another challenge will be finding a politically </p><p>acceptable way to reform the overly generous military pension </p><p>system, which the IMF has said places the largest burden on </p><p>the government budget and largest impediment to the </p><p>government\'s goal of reducing debt and reliance on foreign </p><p>aid.  The military pension system currently runs a deficit </p><p>equivalent to 3.2 percent of GDP and will peak at 4.5 percent </p><p>of GDP over the next 15 years.  Pension benefits provide an </p><p>important unearmarked source of income, particularly to the </p><p>tribal and rural areas from which the military recruits. </p><p>Government proposals, supported by the IMF, to reduce </p><p>benefits and increase contributions and length of service </p><p>requirements are likely to be a major bone of contention in </p><p>relations with the military and security services over the </p><p>next few years. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>16. (C) Like the other "pillars" of the regime -- the tribes </p><p>and the economic elite -- Jordan\'s military, intelligence and </p><p>security forces have benefited from the more than eight </p><p>decades of Hashemite rule.  To ensure the loyalty and </p><p>effectiveness of these institutions in the years ahead, the </p><p>GOJ will need to ensure that it targets its resources </p><p>properly so that those who are tasked with carrying out </p><p>sometimes unpopular actions are provided the tools, training </p><p>and compensation to do so effectively and enthusiastically. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
