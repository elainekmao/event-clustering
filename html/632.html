(U)  THIS EMBASSY CONTINUES TO NOTE THE ROLE OF THE </p><p>LOCAL MEDIA IN HEIGHTENING ETHNIC TENSIONS.  GOVERNMENT </p><p>OWNED AND CONTROLLED CROATIAN TV (HTV) ON SATURDAY, </p><p>JAN. 29, BROADCAST TWO UNSCHEDULED DOCUMENTARIES </p><p>BACK-TO-BACK IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EVENING NEWS.  THE </p><p>FIRST WAS A TWENTY MINUTE FILM CALLED "THE ROAD TO </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00467  01 OF 02  021626Z </p><p>CENTRAL BOSNIA" AND THE SECOND WAS A LONGER FEATURE </p><p>CALLED "THE CHRONOLOGY OF MUSLIM WAR CRIMES AGAINST </p><p>CROATS IN B-H."  THE EVENING MOVIE WAS DELAYED AN HOUR </p><p>IN ORDER TO AIR THESE DOCUMENTARIES.  THE TV SPECIALS </p><p>WERE NOT ON THE DAILY TV SCHEDULE BUT HAD BEEN WELL </p><p>ADVERTISED DURING THE DAY ON HTV.  AS THE TITLES </p><p>INDICATE, THEY FOCUSED ON MUSLIM MISDEEDS IN CENTRAL </p><p>B-H.  BOTH DOCUMENTARIES APPEARED HASTILY PUT TOGETHER, </p><p>AND WERE POORLY PRODUCED.  NEITHER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A </p><p>NARRATED SCRIPT AND BOTH CONSISTED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY </p><p>OF AMATEUR FOOTAGE AND TAPED INTERVIEWS WITH LOCAL </p><p>BOSNIAN CROATS DESCRIBING MUSLIM ATROCITIES.  THERE WAS </p><p>LITTLE DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED AS TO THE TIME AND PLACE </p><p>OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  "THE ROAD TO CENTRAL BOSNIA" INCLUDED </p><p>INTERVIEWS WITH CROAT RESIDENTS OF CENTRAL BOSNIA (ALL </p><p>EXPRESSING FEAR OF MUSLIM FORCES) AND CROAT SOLDIERS. </p><p>THE OVERALL MESSAGE WAS "THE ENEMY IS COMING AND WE ARE </p><p>PREPARED."  "THE CHRONOLOGY OF WAR CRIMES" WAS MORE </p><p>POWERFUL WITH GRAPHIC PICTURES OF CORPSES AND WEEPING </p><p>SURVIVORS, MOSTLY WOMEN.  IN ALL CASES, MUSLIMS WERE </p><p>NAMED AS THE PERPETRATORS OF THE MASSACRES.  MOST OF </p><p>THE FOOTAGE CLEARLY DATED FROM THE FALL OR BEFORE. </p><p>- </p><p>3. (C)  ONE EMBARRASSED PROFESSIONAL TV JOURNALIST </p><p>COMPLAINED TO OUR PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER THAT THIS LINE </p><p>OF TV PROGRAMMING WAS DIRECTED BY THE HEAD OF HTV, </p><p>ANTON VRDOLJAK.  VRDOLJAK IS A HIGHLY UNPOPULAR, BUT </p><p>INFLUENTIAL, MEMBER OF THE RULING PARTY AND THE </p><p>CROATIAN PARLIAMENT.  ACCORDING TO THE JOURNALIST, THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00467  01 OF 02  021626Z </p><p>PROGRAMMING CHIEF AT HTV WAS AFRAID OF VRDOLJAK AND </p><p>WOULD NEVER RESIST WHAT THE "BIG MAN" DIRECTED. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  THESE TV BROADCASTS CONTRAST TO THOSE IN THE </p><p>AUTUMN WHICH DEPICTED GRAPHICALLY (USING CNN FOOTAGE) </p><p>STARVING MUSLIMS IN THE HVO-RUN DETENTION CAMPS AND THE </p><p>HVO\'S DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD BRIDGE IN MOSTAR.  HTV HAS </p><p>ALSO AIRED SHOWS WITH SURPRISINGLY CANDID CRITICISM </p><p>FROM OPPOSITION LEADERS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S B-H </p><p>POLICY.  THUS, THESE CRUDE PROPAGANDIST EFFORTS </p><p>REPRESENT A BACKWARD STEP FOR HTV, AS WELL AS A SIGN OF </p><p>A DEGENERATING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  ANXIETY AMONG MUSLIM RESIDENTS OF ZAGREB WAS </p><p>EXPRESSED BY THE WIFE OF A LEADING MUSLIM HUMANITARIAN </p><p>AID WORKER WHO IS ALSO A PROFESSIONAL.  SHE DECLINED AN </p><p>INVITATION FOR A PRESTIGIOUS USIA VISITORS\' PROGRAM </p><p>BECAUSE OF FEAR THAT HER EMPLOYER WOULD FIRE HER IF SHE </p><p>WAS ABSENT FROM HER JOB.  OBVIOUSLY AGITATED AND </p><p>FRUSTRATED SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD BEEN WARNED FOUR TIMES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  00467  02 OF 02  021626Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-01   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  C-01     OASY-00  DOEE-00 </p><p>      EB-01    EUR-01   HA-09    H-01     IMMC-01  TEDE-00  INR-00 </p><p>      IO-16    LAB-01   L-01     ADS-00   NEA-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   PA-01    PM-01    PRS-01   P-01     RPCS-01  SCT-03 </p><p>      SIL-00   SNP-00   SP-00    SR-00    SSO-00   STR-01   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     RPE-01   SNIS-00  NISC-02    /049W </p><p>                  ------------------20F10F  021627Z /38 </p><p>O 021620Z FEB 94 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 0729 </p><p>INFO SECDEF WASHDC//ISA/ISP// </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ3/ECJ4/ECJ5/ECPOLAD// </p><p>CINCUSAFE RAMSTEIN AB GE//DO/LG/XP/IN/POLAD// </p><p>CINCUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GE//J3/J4/J5/POLAD// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>COMSIXTHFLT NAPLES IT//N2// </p><p>USIA WASHDC 4220 </p><p>USEC BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>AMEMBASSY WARSAW </p><p>AMEMBASSY TIRANA </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY SOFIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>497IG AMHS BOLLING AFB DC//INAGE// </p><p>HQ JTF PP NAPLES IT//CA/POLAD// </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRAGUE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00467  02 OF 02  021626Z </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY LJUBLJANA </p><p>JOINT STAFF WASHDC//J5-PMA/J2I// </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUCHAREST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 ZAGREB 000467 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO FOR EMBASSY BOSNIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, HR, BK </p><p>SUBJECT: TFSROL: THE MEDIA WAR:  CROAT-MUSLIM </p><p>         NAME-CALLING </p><p> </p><p>THAT HER PERFORMANCE WAS BEING CLOSELY MONITORED.
