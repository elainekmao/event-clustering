<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ACCRA 000611 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, GH </p><p>SUBJECT: IMF REP\'S PRIMARILY POSITIVE READOUT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Mary Carlin Yates for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p> and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Ambassador Mary Carlin Yates and econoff </p><p>visited Enrique de la Piedra, the IMF Resident Representative </p><p>on March 20. De la Piedra offered a positive readout of the </p><p>Budget now under Parliamentary review and Multiple Donor </p><p>Budget Support. The Resident Representative finds affinity </p><p>with his working level colleagues and leadership in the Bank </p><p>of Ghana and the Ministry of Economic Planning and Regional </p><p>Cooperation, finds it occasionally difficult to work with the </p><p>Ministry of Finance and is wary of the messages put out by </p><p>the Minister of Trade and Industry.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>The Budget </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Despite the surprise tariff increases, de la Piedra </p><p>was very positive about the Budget (septel). The IMF was </p><p>looking for adequate revenue mobilization (i.e. taxes) effort </p><p>and zero domestic debt financing. The IMF also is seeking </p><p>better expenditure controls.  There are revenue enhancement </p><p>measures in the budget that please the IMF. He also noted </p><p>that the government understands that it cannot encourage </p><p>investment if banks realize bigger gains assuming government </p><p>debt instead of lending to local businesses. The GoG\'s </p><p>spending will have to come under control. De la Piedra was </p><p>slightly concerned about timing, as control of domestic debt </p><p>and expenditure and revenue mobilization are usually more </p><p>difficult in an election year. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>Multi Donor Budget Support </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The Ambassador asked about Multi Donor Budget Support </p><p>(MDBS) in Ghana and pointed out that better coordination </p><p>between donors is a logical step.  The Resident </p><p>Representative sees Multi Donor Budget Support as an overall </p><p>plus for both sides. The Government of Ghana saves on </p><p>transaction costs for financing projects and the donors </p><p>increase their clout in Ghana and the region. De la Piedra </p><p>cautioned that the only way MDBS will work is if the GoG uses </p><p>the funds adequately to address the needs of the Ghanaian </p><p>people. The money will not be available in the future if the </p><p>funds are misused now. The Ambassador did not share the </p><p>current position of USAID that the USG will not be able to </p><p>sign this framework agreement but this was stated at the </p><p>March 24 Mini-CG held in Accra. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Bank of Ghana </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) De la Piedra, The International Monetary Fund Resident </p><p>Representative, described himself as a link between the IMF </p><p>team in Washington, the Government of Ghana and the donor </p><p>partners. He has good relations with his interlocutors at the </p><p>Bank of Ghana (BOG), noting that Bank Governor Paul Acquah </p><p>and his special assistant, Mahamadou Bawumia speak the same </p><p>language as the IMF. He commented that the Bank Governor is </p><p>doing well in a difficult job. De la Piedra noted how the </p><p>tables have turned for Acquah, a 20-year veteran of the IMF, </p><p>now answering to Ghana\'s market and political pressures as </p><p>well as the donor community. Overall, de la Piedra believes </p><p>the BOG is on the right track. It is keeping monetary policy </p><p>under tight control and working to improve the financial </p><p>market (i.e., Acquah\'s work to improve the FOREX market). </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The more difficult issue, according to de la Piedra, </p><p>is restructuring the Bank of Ghana itself. Ambassador Yates </p><p>noted Acquah\'s concern about capturing more of the funds that </p><p>are currently outside the banking system. De la Piedra </p><p>responded, saying that the primary concern should be the </p><p>market itself, i.e., what is in the banking sector, not what </p><p>is not. The Bank needs to create incentives for people to </p><p>bring their money into the formal banking sector. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p>Ministry of Economic Planning and Regional Cooperation </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) De la Piedra\'s primary concern is the linking of the </p><p>Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy to the Budget, a difficult </p><p>task due to the internal wrangling between Minister of </p><p>Economic Planning and Regional Cooperation Paa Kwesi Nduom </p><p>and the Minister of Finance, Yaw Osafo-Maafo. De la Piedra </p><p>also confided that there is some suspicion that Nduom, a </p><p>minority party candidate (Convention People\'s Party) from </p><p>Cape Coast, was awarded his position because he was "robbed" </p><p>of the Parliamentary seat. Nevertheless, Nduom is doing well </p><p>with a small but talented staff. De la Piedra also weighed in </p><p>the Cabinet shake-up rumors that have plagued the Kufuor </p><p>Administration for the last year and half by noting that </p><p>Nduom has been mentioned as a replacement Minister of Finance </p><p>should Osafo-Maafo stumble. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Ministry of Finance </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) While he found the BOG pragmatic, he observed the </p><p>Minister of Finance Osafo-Maafo and his Special Assistant </p><p>Tony Osei to be primarily politically motivated. De la Piedra </p><p>noted that during the rocky period between the IMF and the </p><p>GoG last fall, it was difficult to get on the same page as </p><p>the Finance Minister regarding the problems with the budget </p><p>overruns. </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Ministry of Trade and Industry </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>8. (C) Most worrying to de la Piedra is the Minister of Trade </p><p>and Industry Kofi Konadu Apraku. De la Piedra sees a trend in </p><p>Apraku\'s public speeches and comments that is not good. De la </p><p>Piedra saw the rice and chicken tariff increases in the </p><p>budget as the handiwork of Minister Apraku. De la Piedra </p><p>warned that we (the international donor community) need to </p><p>apply more pressure on the tariff issue to ensure that Ghana </p><p>does not go that route. (Note: The Ambassador raised the </p><p>issue and our concerns about the augmented tariffs on rice </p><p>and poultry with the Minister of Agriculture on March 26, but </p><p>with little satisfaction.) The domestic content bill is </p><p>another example of Apraku\'s artful vilification of trade </p><p>liberalization policies. While the bill will conform in </p><p>language to Ghana\'s bi- and multi- lateral contractual </p><p>obligations, domestic firms will be given more help </p><p>(unspecified). </p><p>YATES </p><p></p></div>
