(SBU) Canada\'s economy is like the "Energizer Bunny" - </p><p>it just keeps going and going.  Canada should post a </p><p>solid 3.3 percent annual increase in real GDP in 2002, </p><p>which is more than double the 1.5 percent gain recorded </p><p>in 2001.  All components of real GDP contributed to the </p><p>increase with the exception of business investment in </p><p>plant and equipment.  Positive business sentiment and an </p><p>economy moving toward full capacity should reverse the </p><p>trend in plant and equipment investment this year and </p><p>next.  Other contributors to future growth include new </p><p>spending by the government on health, the environment and </p><p>defense - fueled by stronger tax revenues, and a recovery </p><p>in the U.S. resulting in Canadian exports to more than </p><p>double this year and continue to grow in 2004.  More </p><p>balanced increases in investment, plus ongoing gains in </p><p>consumer spending, round out the picture for why Canada\'s </p><p>real economic growth should improve to 3.5 percent in </p><p>2003 -- with the outlook for 2004 now estimated at 4.3 </p><p>percent.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Introduction </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.   (SBU) Canada\'s economy grew at an annualized rate of </p><p>3.1 percent in the third quarter of 2002, a sharp drop </p><p>from the robust growth of 5.7 and 4.4 percent recorded in </p><p>the first two quarters, respectively.  Exports </p><p>contributed strongly to growth in IIIQ 2002, as did </p><p>business investment in residential construction and in </p><p>capital equipment.  However, growth was dampened by a </p><p>slowdown in consumer spending (primarily in autos) and in </p><p>the pace of inventory accumulation.  Following the </p><p>anticipated 3.3 percent growth in 2002, we expect the </p><p>Canadian economy to grow by 3.5 percent in 2003, and 4.3 </p><p>percent in 2004.  Domestic demand should stay strong over </p><p>the forecast period, and solid growth estimates for the </p><p>U.S. economy bode well for Canada\'s external sector.  We </p><p>anticipate a tighter monetary policy beginning in late </p><p>2003 and early 2004 as the Canadian economy reaches full </p><p>capacity, which should slow quarterly growth rates in all </p><p>sectors of the economy in the second half of 2004. </p><p>Canada\'s inflation rate should remain in the upper end of </p><p>the Bank of Canada\'s 1-3 percent target band, and the </p><p>unemployment rate should stay at around 7.6 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Assumptions </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) We assume the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Real U.S. growth rates of 2.3 percent in 2002, 2.8 </p><p>percent in 2003, and 3.4 percert in 2004 (ref A). </p><p> </p><p>-- Real G-7 growth rates of 2.2 percent this year and 2.7 </p><p>percent next year (ref A). </p><p> </p><p>-- No major shocks in the oil and gas sector.  We assume </p><p>that a `war premium\' has already been built in. </p><p> </p><p>-- The GOC will introduce a stimulative budget in </p><p>February 2003, implementing many of the recommendations </p><p>of the November, 2002 Romanow Report on reforming </p><p>Canada\'s health care system, providing incentives to meet </p><p>the targets of the Kyoto Accord, and replacing outdated </p><p>military equipment. </p><p>-- The GOC will uphold its promises to the Canadian oil </p><p>and gas sector made in exchange for their grudging </p><p>support for Kyoto Accord ratification. </p><p> </p><p>-- Ontario, Canada\'s largest province demographically, </p><p>will maintain its cap on residential electricity prices. </p><p>(After the cap on electricity prices was lifted, </p><p>residential electricity bills soared by 50 percent and </p><p>more.  Ontario\'s Premier quickly reinstated the price cap </p><p>late last year, and Ontarians have received C$75 per </p><p>household rebate checks, which we assume were spent in </p><p>December 2002 and are included in our IVQ 2002 forecast.) </p><p> </p><p>Risks </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Risks to the forecast include: </p><p> </p><p>-- Sluggish growth in the U.S. economy (with special </p><p>concern about flat employment growth); </p><p> </p><p>-- A longer-than-anticipated war with Iraq. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Domestic Demand: Full Steam Ahead! </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) We forecast annualized quarterly growth rates </p><p>between 2.8 and 4 percent in both private consumption and </p><p>government spending over most of the forecast period. </p><p>Domestic demand will be fuelled by the record 560,000 net </p><p>new jobs in 2002.  Corporate profits and business </p><p>investment intentions suggest aggregate employment should </p><p>continue to grow this year and next (albeit not at the </p><p>same rate as in 2002).  This translates into sizeable </p><p>increases in consumer spending and a hefty boost for </p><p>government tax revenues.  Business investment in non- </p><p>residential construction and machinery/equipment is </p><p>forecast to rise, while investment in residential </p><p>construction should moderate after rising by over 15 </p><p>percent in 2002, the highest annual growth rate in 15 </p><p>years.  Pent-up demand and high vacancy rates accounted </p><p>for the steep increase in residential construction in </p><p>2002. </p><p> </p><p>New Spending On Health, Environment, Military Equipment </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) In FY2001-2002, Canada\'s net federal debt was </p><p>C$536.5 billion, for a debt-to-GDP ratio of just over 49 </p><p>percent (down from almost 71 percent six years earlier). </p><p>The debt reduction saves the GOC C$3 billion annually in </p><p>interest payments, and provides increased fiscal </p><p>flexibility.  In addition, strong employment growth </p><p>points to larger-than-expected surpluses.  The Conference </p><p>Board of Canada predicts possible GOC fiscal surpluses of </p><p>almost C$20 billion in FY2002-2003 and FY2003-04, almost </p><p>double the C$11 billion that Finance Minister Manley </p><p>predicted in his fiscal update in October (ref B). </p><p>However, we expect the GOC to respond to political </p><p>pressure to spend part of the surplus on health care, the </p><p>environment, and military equipment, with the remainder </p><p>dedicated to further debt reduction, producing a balanced </p><p>budget for FY2003-2004.  Manley has made it quite clear </p><p>that the GOC will cut spending rather than risk a budget </p><p>deficit. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Incremental spending increases introduced in </p><p>FY2000 (on health care, defense spending, infrastructure, </p><p>innovation, the environment, cities and aboriginal </p><p>affairs) will continue this fiscal year and next. </p><p>However, increased spending on health care and the </p><p>environment seem likely in the upcoming federal budget. </p><p>The GOC-commissioned Romanow Report recommends a C$15 </p><p>billion increase in health care spending over the next </p><p>three fiscal years (in increments of C$3.5 billion, C$5 </p><p>billion, and C$6.5 billion).  Costs of ratification and </p><p>implementation of the Kyoto Accord are unclear, but the </p><p>GOC, to placate Canada\'s oil and gas sector,  has </p><p>promised that the sector\'s contribution to meeting </p><p>emission targets in the first commitment period of the </p><p>Accord will be limited to C$15 per tonne. </p><p> </p><p>And Don\'t Rule Out The External Sector! </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Canada\'s global merchandise trade surplus </p><p>dropped by an estimated C$10 billion in 2002, to C$54 </p><p>billion (US$34.4 billion) from the previous year, as </p><p>demand softened from Canada\'s major trading partners, in </p><p>particular, the United States.  This resulted in a S$9.6B </p><p>(US$6.1B) drop in Canada\'s global current account </p><p>balance.  However, given U.S. and G-7 growth projections </p><p>for the forecast period, Canadian exports should grow at </p><p>a respectable rate, outpacing increases in investment- </p><p>related imports.  In particular, energy exports should </p><p>remain strong and so should exports of consumer durables </p><p>and office machinery and equipment.  We forecast that </p><p>Canada\'s global merchandise trade surplus will rise only </p><p>slightly in 2003, to C$54.5B (US$34.7B), before climbing </p><p>to C$66.9B (US$42.6B) in 2004.  The improvement is in </p><p>line with the ongoing strength in the global and U.S. </p><p>economies. </p><p> </p><p>Inflation </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU)  Canada\'s inflation rate, as measured by the </p><p>year-over-year percent change in the All-Items Consumer </p><p>Price Index, jumped to 4.3 percent in November 2002. </p><p>However, Statistics Canada attributes the large increase </p><p>to a sharp decline in the base used for comparison.  For </p><p>example, the All-Items CPI fell by an unusually steep </p><p>monthly 0.9 percent between October and November 2001, </p><p>so without a similar drop in the index in 2002, the year- </p><p>over-year percent change is exaggerated.  (Note: The </p><p>monthly decline in November 2001 was attributed to a </p><p>steep drop in energy prices and traveler accommodation. </p><p>The same factors caused the All-Items CPI to drop by 0.5 </p><p>percent in October 2001 from the previous month.)  We </p><p>expect Canada\'s inflation rate to remain at the upper </p><p>end of the Bank of Canada\'s 1-3 percent target band. </p><p>However, there is a risk of higher inflation in the </p><p>second half of 2003 as the Canadian economy reaches full </p><p>capacity. </p><p> </p><p>Monetary Policy </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The Bank of Canada (BOC) is still looking for </p><p>an opportunity to take back some of the low-interest </p><p>stimulus that it pumped into the Canadian economy last </p><p>year.  While the BOC continues a "made in Canada" </p><p>monetary policy, i.e., not following the Fed in lockstep, </p><p>we believe that monetary policy will tighten later this </p><p>year once the Canadian economy reaches full capacity.  We </p><p>expect the spread between U.S. and Canadian short-term </p><p>interest rates to remain at roughly 175 basis points in </p><p>favor of Canada.  While we do not forecast exchange </p><p>rates, we believe the Canadian dollar will continue </p><p>trading in the upper-63 cents range vis--vis the U.S. </p><p>dollar.  Any appreciation linked to tighter monetary </p><p>policy will be erased as the Fed increases U.S. interest </p><p>rates.  While the weaker dollar is a boon for Canadian </p><p>exporters, it makes investment-related imports and </p><p>consumer durables much more expensive. </p><p> </p><p>TABLE 1.
