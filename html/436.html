<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MOGADISHU 11232 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, SO </p><p>SUBJ:  DECEMBER 22, 1990 MEETING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p> </p><p>REF:  MOGADISHU 08583 </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2. SUMMARY:  THE PRIME MINISTER ACCEPTED STOICALLY </p><p>NOTIFICATION OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF FUEL, EQUIPMENT AND USG </p><p>CONTRACT PERSONNEL FROM BERBERA.  INITIALLY UPSET </p><p>ABOUT THE EVACUATION OF USG PERSONNEL AND DEPENDENTS </p><p>FROM MOGADISHU, HE CONCEDED THAT WE HAD THE RIGHT TO </p><p>TAKE WHAT SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WE FELT APPROPRIATE. </p><p>ASKED WHAT GAMEPLAN HIS GOVERNMENT HAD FOR POLITICAL </p><p>RECONCILIATION FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF THE </p><p>CAIRO CONFERENCE, HE COULD NOT IDENTIFY ONE.  THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER DID PLEA FOR FOOD AID AND REQUESTED OUR </p><p>INTERCESSION WITH THE IBRD.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  INTRODUCTION:  CALLED DECEMBER 22, 1990 ON PRIME </p><p>MINISTER MOHAMED HAWADLE MADAR TO OFFICIALLY NOTIFY </p><p>THE GSDR OF THE SUSPENSION OF OUR ASSISTANCE PROGRAM </p><p>AND THE WITHDRAWAL OF PERSONNEL, FUEL AND EQUIPMENT </p><p>FROM BERBERA.  I INFORMED THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR </p><p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF OUR VOLUNTARY DEPARTURE STATUS </p><p>DECEMBER 8.  BUT I SUBSEQUENTLY DELAYED TELLING THE </p><p>GSDR WE HAD MOVED TO AN ORDERED DEPARTURE, AND OF THE </p><p>CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, UNTIL OUR </p><p>FILIPINO CONTRACTORS LEFT THE COUNTRY.  I WAS AFRAID </p><p>THE GSDR MIGHT COMPEL THEM TO REMAIN, IN ORDER TO KEEP </p><p>ITS PEACE CUBE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK FUNCTION- </p><p>ING.  MADAR MET ME WITHOUT A NOTETAKER OR OTHER AIDE. </p><p>I WAS UNACCOMPANIED. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>4.  EVACUATION:  INITIATING THE DISCUSSION, I </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THE CONTINUED DETERIORATION OF </p><p>THE SECURITY SITUATION HAD LED TO A USG DECISION </p><p>TO WITHDRAW ALL AMERICAN GOVERNMENT DEPENDENTS AND </p><p>NON-ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL FROM SOMALIA.  UNFORTUNATELY, </p><p>THIS STEP WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY TO SUSPEND OUR CIVIL </p><p>AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.  THESE WOULD RESUME </p><p>WHEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN SECURITY CONDITIONS PERMITTED </p><p>THE RETURN OF THE PERSONNEL NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THEM. </p><p>THE FUEL AND EQUIPMENT STORED AT BERBERA ARE NEEDED </p><p>BY U.S. FORCES IN THE GULF, I TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER. </p><p>THESE COMMODITIES, AND THE AMERICAN AND FILIPINO </p><p>CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO BERBERA, WOULD BE REMOVED </p><p>WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, I EXPLAINED. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>5.  RESPONDING FIRST ON THE SUBJECT OF EQUIPMENT IN </p><p>BERBERA, THE PRIME MINISTER SAID SIMPLY, "IT BELONGS </p><p>TO YOU.  IF YOU NEED IT ELSEWHERE, TAKE IT."  ON THE WITH- </p><p>DRAWAL OF USG DEPENDENTS AND STAFF FROM MOGADISHU, MADAR </p><p>FIRST REGISTERED UNHAPPINESS AT THE "UNILATERAL" AMERICAN </p><p>DECISION.  BUT AS WE TALKED IT THROUGH, AND I REMINDED </p><p>HIM HOW OFTEN I HAD TOLD SENIOR GSDR OFFICIALS THAT OUR </p><p>PERSONNEL WOULD BE REDUCED IF THE SECURITY PICTURE </p><p>BECAME BLEAKER, THE PRIME MINISTER BACKED DOWN.  HE </p><p>FINALLY STATED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD MY FIRST CONCERN HAD </p><p>TO BE THE WELFARE OF MY COLLEAGUES.  HE THEN ADMITTED </p><p>HIS BASIC CONCERN WAS THAT THE REGIME\'S OPPONENTS HAVE </p><p>BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE PARTIAL EVACUATION OF THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS NO NEED </p><p>TO NEGOTIATE WITH HIS GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE IT IS ON ITS </p><p>LAST LEGS.  I ASSURED MADAR THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING </p><p>TO DISCOURAGE SUCH UNFOUNDED CONCLUSIONS BY TELLING THE </p><p>OPPOSITION IT SHOULD TALK WITH THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE </p><p>THE REGIME HAS CONSIDERABLE STAYING POWER. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>6.  RECONCILIATION:  EXPRESSING REGRET AT THE </p><p>COLLAPSE OF THE CAIRO CONFERENCE, I ASKED THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER TO OUTLINE THE GSDR\'S NEXT STEPS </p><p>TOWARD A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF ITS DIFFERENCES </p><p>WITH ITS OPPONENTS.  IN RESPONSE, AN EXTREMELY </p><p>DEFENSIVE MADAR SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ARREST OF THE MANIFESTO GROUP MEMBERS, INSISTING THAT </p><p>THE GSDR SHOULD NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE POSTPONE- </p><p>MENT OF THE CONFERENCE BECAUSE IT HAD ARRESTED TWO </p><p>MEN GUILTY OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.  RATHER THAN ENGAGE </p><p>IN FRUITLESS DEBATE ON THAT ISSUE, I AGAIN ASKED THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER TO OUTLINE WHAT STEPS THE GSDR NEXT </p><p>INTENDS TO TAKE TO REACH A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT WITH </p><p>ITS OPPONENTS.  MADAR STATED THAT THE GSDR STANDS </p><p>READY TO GO TO CAIRO OR TO MEET IN MOGADISHU WITH </p><p>ANYONE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COUNTRY\'S FUTURE.  IT ALSO </p><p>MIGHT TRY TO HOST A CONFERENCE OF TRADITIONAL LEADERS, </p><p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND INTELLECTUALS IN MOGADISHU, </p><p>HE SAID.  HOWEVER, MADAR HAD NO STRATEGY TO DESCRIBE. </p><p>IN FACT, HE ASKED ME TO SUGGEST ONE TO HIM.  HE PROVED </p><p>UNFAMILIAR WITH HICKS\' SPEECH ON FEDERALISM AND </p><p>SKEPTICAL OF ITS THESIS WHEN I DESCRIBED IT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>7.  FOOD AID:  LABELING HIS GOVERNMENT AS THE FIRST </p><p>CIVILIAN REGIME IN 21 YEARS, THE PRIME MINISTER SAID </p><p>HE WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT HIS PROVISIONAL </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSTITUTION, UNDERTAKEN AT </p><p>THE URGING OF WESTERN EMBASSIES, HAD NOT TRIGGERED THE </p><p>RESUMPTION OF WESTERN ASSISTANCE HE EXPECTED.  THE </p><p>WEST RISKS SEEING ANOTHER MILITARY REGIME IN SOMALIA </p><p>HE INSISTED.  MADAR THEN TOOK ME TO TASK FOR THE </p><p>ALLEGED REFUSAL OF THE USG TO PROVIDE FOOD AID TO </p><p>SOMALIA, AT A TIME WHEN IT IS FURNISHING HOSTILE </p><p>REGIMES IN ETHIOPIA AND MOZAMBIQUE WITH MASSIVE FOOD </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  MADAR LISTENED PATIENTLY AS I EXPLAINED </p><p>THE APOLITICAL NATURE OF USG EMERGENCY RELIEF PROGRAMS, </p><p>INFORMED HIM THAT USG COMMODITIES ARE BEING DELIVERED </p><p>TO THE ICRC AT BERBERA FOR USE IN THE NORTH, AND GAVE </p><p>HIM A STATUS REPORT ON OUR PROPOSAL FOR 5 MILLION USDOLS </p><p>IN EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR THE MOGADISHU AREA. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>8.  PETROLEUM SHORTAGE:  BEFORE I COULD LEAVE, THE </p><p>PRIME MINISTER ASKED THAT THE USG INTERCEDE WITH THE </p><p>IBRD TO OBTAIN RELEASE OF THE THIRD TRANCHE </p><p>OF THE AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM.  HE </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT  THE GSDR WAS COUNTING ON IT TO FINANCE </p><p>PETROLEUM IMPORTS FOR WHICH IT HAS NO OTHER FUNDS.  AS </p><p>JUSTIFICATION, HE MENTIONED SEVERAL REFORMS THE GSDR </p><p>HAS TAKEN SINCE THE RECENT DEPARTURE OF THE IBRD </p><p>AGRICULTURAL TEAM.  IN RESPONDING TO MADAR, I GAVE </p><p>HIM NO BASIS FOR ENCOURAGEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>- </p><p>9.  COMMENT:  THE PRIME MINISTER\'S INABILITY TO </p><p>IDENTIFY A STRATEGY FOR POLITICAL RECONCILIATION </p><p>REFLECTS MORE, I SUSPECT, THE NEAR PARALYSIS </p><p>AFFLICTING SIAD BARRE\'S GOVERNMENT THAN ANY </p><p>WIDESPREAD BELIEF THAT GENERAL MORGAN\'S ONGOING </p><p>MILITARY CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO CHECKMATE THE REGIME\'S </p><p>ARMED  OPPONENTS.  MADAR\'S DEFENSIVENESS AND LACK OF </p><p>A POLITICAL GAMEPLAN WERE ECHOED AT LUNCH DECEMBER 23 </p><p>BY REGIME LOYALIST BASHIR FARAH KAHIE, MADAR\'S </p><p>MINISTER OF COMMERCE. </p><p> </p><p>BISHOP </p><p></p></div>
