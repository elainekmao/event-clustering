(C) Summary:  On September 29 an all-party meeting </p><p>recommended that national parliamentary elections, originally </p><p>scheduled to begin November 13, be postponed.  The </p><p>recommendation--reached just one day after the Election </p><p>Commission finally announced the long-awaited schedule for </p><p>the polls--was made after the parties reached a consensus </p><p>that the deteriorating security situation warrants postponing </p><p>the elections.  A Cabinet meeting September 30 decided that </p><p>the Government should discuss a possible new date for polls </p><p>and the make-up of a suggested all-party government with </p><p>political party leaders.  If the Prime Minister decides to </p><p>take the recommendation to the King, the decision would give </p><p>the monarch the all-party, public consensus he required </p><p>before invoking his Constitutional authority to postpone the </p><p>polls (Ref B). End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On September 29 an all-party meeting at the </p><p>residence of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba recommended </p><p>that the Prime Minister ask King Gyanendra to postpone </p><p>mid-term parliamentary elections, originally scheduled to </p><p>begin November 13, because of the uncertain security </p><p>environment.  The meeting proposed that a new interim </p><p>all-party government, with representation from each party in </p><p>the former Parliament, be formed until elections can take </p><p>place.  The meeting did not address fixing a date for the </p><p>deferred elections.  A Cabinet meeting September 30 decided </p><p>that the Government should continue discussion of the matter, </p><p>including a time-frame for the deferred election and the </p><p>make-up of an interim government, with political party </p><p>leaders. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Hom Nath Dahal, a former MP and now spokesman for </p><p>PM Deuba\'s newly formed Nepali Congress (Democratic) Party </p><p>(Ref A), said that the PM and his party were the only </p><p>participants in the meeting urging that elections take place </p><p>as scheduled.  When it became apparent, however, that the </p><p>other parties were strongly in favor of postponement, the NC </p><p>(Democratic) had to go along with the consensus, Dahal said. </p><p>He suggested that the new interim all-party government would </p><p>likely be headed by Deuba. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  The decision to postpone elections comes just one </p><p>day after the Election Commission finally announced a </p><p>schedule--pending since the dissolution of Parliament May </p><p>22--for phased polling throughout the country.  The Election </p><p>Commission timetable called for polling to occur in six </p><p>discrete phases, extending from November 13 to January 10. </p><p>Filing of cadidacies was to have begun October 5. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Despite the all-party consensus, there are a few </p><p>voices of dissension.  Former MP Narayan Singh Pun, who left </p><p>the Nepali Congress to form his own political party to </p><p>contest the November elections (and thus did not attend the </p><p>September 29 meeting), complained that postponing the polls </p><p>in response to Maoist terrorism amounts to an admission of </p><p>defeat by the Government.  We are ceding the ground to the </p><p>Maosits and letting them win, he argued.  If the mainstream </p><p>political parties show they are too afraid to campaign and </p><p>shut themselves up in Kathmandu, the Maoists will fill the </p><p>vacuum left in the districts and become stronger, rather than </p><p>weaker, in the interim until elections, he predicted.  He </p><p>expressed great disappointment with his political colleagues\' </p><p>timidity, adding that no one will ever be able to guarantee </p><p>an environment of complete safety--even six months or one </p><p>year from now--for elections.  He said that many of his </p><p>former party workers when he was in the Nepali Congress have </p><p>become so disenchanted that they have joined the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  Comment:  Although few people we have talked to over </p><p>the past six weeks expected the elections to proceed as </p><p>scheduled, no political leader seemed willing to say so in </p><p>public.  As long as the Election Commission delayed </p><p>publishing the schedule--and as long as no one had to file </p><p>for candidacy and show up in any potentially dangerous </p><p>constituencies--the various parties seemed willing to </p><p>continue the increasingly implausible charade that voting </p><p>would take place on November 13.  But less than 24 hours </p><p>after the long-delayed schedule was finally announced, the </p><p>leaders of seven different parties had  hammered out, in </p><p>uncharacteristically short order, a consensus that they </p><p>didn\'t want to have the elections after all.  Whatever its </p><p>timing, the recommendation seems to fulfill the two </p><p>conditions for a request for royal intervention--that it </p><p>arise from consensus and be made in public--that King </p><p>Gyanendra had stipulated he was looking for before invoking </p><p>his constitutional authority to postpone elections (Ref A). </p><p>We expect the Prime Minister will forward the request to the </p><p>King--along with his own recommendations for the composition </p><p>of a caretaker government--soon. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
