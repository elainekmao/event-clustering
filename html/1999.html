<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 002347 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DRL FOR KEIZER, ACCRA FOR KAMINSKI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/18/2006 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, PREF, CASC, MOPS, KIRF, KISL, EAID, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: JOS CONFLICT ASSESSMENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) ABUJA 2290 (B) SECSTATE 160413 (C) ABUJA </p><p>     2258 (D) ABUJA 2255 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SUBJECT: ASSESSMENT OF CONFLICT IN JOS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U)  Summary.  A team of officials from the U.S., U.K. and </p><p>Netherlands diplomatic missions in Abuja drove to Jos on </p><p>Friday, September 14, to meet with their nationals and to </p><p>assess the situation there following the ethnic and religious </p><p>conflict that began on September 7.  It appears that over </p><p>2,300 people may have lost their lives in the conflict in the </p><p>immediate vicinity of Jos, while a significant but unknown </p><p>number of casualties also occurred in outlying villages and </p><p>towns.  Calm was restored following a flare-up of violence on </p><p>September 12, and only two Amcit and two British families </p><p>elected to depart Jos temporarily with the diplomatic convoy. </p><p>We have not heard of further violence in the countryside. </p><p>However the diplomatic team did not venture outside of town. </p><p>Consular issues pertaining to the American community in Jos </p><p>will be reported in septel.  President Obasanjo has put </p><p>pressure on Governor Dariye of Plateau State to take </p><p>corrective measures to reconcile the two sides, but Dariye\'s </p><p>government, through its pro-Christian partisanship, may have </p><p>already forfeited its ability to be a fair arbiter for peace. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Background </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U)  American citizen, governmental and private sources </p><p>emphasized to Poloff that tensions had been building in Jos </p><p>for months for several reasons.    Primary among these was </p><p>the influx of new residents from Kaduna and Kano in the </p><p>aftermath of last year\'s crises there, which resulted in a </p><p>near doubling of Jos\' population.  The immigrants included </p><p>many ethnic Ibgos, Yoruba and other non-Muslim ethnic groups </p><p>from Kaduna and Bauchi, but many others were Hausa.  The </p><p>influx of new residents sparked competition for state </p><p>resources; chief among these was access to state and federal </p><p>government positions in Plateau State.  Even though Jos </p><p>itself was initially founded largely by Hausa-Fulani families </p><p>around the turn of the century, the non-Muslim ethnic groups </p><p>indigenous to the surrounding area have refused to accord </p><p>them the status of "indigenes," which Nigerians understand to </p><p>mean a group possessing the right to lay claim to government </p><p>resources and patronage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U)  While the status of its Hausa population has remained </p><p>unsettled for years, the descendants of the early Hausa </p><p>families in Jos have long dominated the city\'s economic </p><p>life--provoking a certain amount of envy among their </p><p>"indigenous" neighbors.  The recent influx of Hausa-Fulani </p><p>immigrants from elsewhere in the North, economic stagnation, </p><p>and the introduction of different versions of criminal </p><p>Shari\'a law in the North, have all contributed to rising fear </p><p>and resentment among major indigenous ethnic groups in </p><p>northern Plateau State: the Birom, Anaguta, Jarawa and </p><p>Niango.  The recurring conflict between urban Hausa-Fulani </p><p>Muslims in Tafawa Balewa in southern Bauchi, nearly 100 </p><p>kilometers from Jos, and "indigenous" ethnic groups </p><p>surrounding it, has also contributed to rising tensions in </p><p>Plateau State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U)  Against this backdrop, Alhaji Mukhtar Mohammed was in </p><p>mid-August appointed to head the National Poverty Eradication </p><p>Program (NPEP) for the Jos North Local Government Area. </p><p>(Note: Jos is divided into two LGA\'s, North and South.  Jos </p><p>North contains most of the Hausa/Muslim population of the </p><p>city, roughly 40%.  End Note.)  Mukhtar\'s appointment was </p><p>strongly opposed by the non-Hausa-Fulani residents of Jos </p><p>North.  This appointment sparked a battle of increasingly </p><p>strident ethnic and religious rhetoric between two youth </p><p>organizations, the Jasawa Development Association for the </p><p>predominantly Muslim Hausa-Fulani, and the Plateau Youth </p><p>Council for the predominantly Christian other indigenous </p><p>ethnic groups.  Contacts in Jos have reported that both </p><p>organizations consist of unemployed, uneducated and/or </p><p>impoverished youth, seeking to create--and to capitalize </p><p>upon--ethnic and religious conflict. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U)  As tensions rose in Jos, rumors began spreading of </p><p>men having their genitals magically removed or shrunken by </p><p>shaking hands with ill-intentioned magicians from the </p><p>opposing ethnic groups.  Christians also appear to have </p><p>believed that a well-armed invasion of Muslim hordes from the </p><p>core North, Niger and Chad was imminent.  Oblivious to the </p><p>potential for unrest, or perhaps relying on the fact that Jos </p><p>had never suffered ethnic conflict, Governor Joshua Dariye </p><p>left for the U.S. nearly one week prior to the outbreak of </p><p>violence and was not present for the slaughter that ensued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>The Conflict </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U)  There are many stories about how the fighting was </p><p>triggered.  We have strong confidence in none of them, but </p><p>most credible overall involved the attempt by a Christian </p><p>woman to drive through a street near the Central Mosque, </p><p>which was closed due to overflow crowds at Juma\'at prayers on </p><p>Friday, September 7.  (Note: When urban mosques overflow on </p><p>Friday, surrounding streets may be closed for 45-60 minutes, </p><p>as worshippers roll out prayer mats and listen to the Imam on </p><p>loudspeakers.  End Note.)  Both sides claim that the other </p><p>had planned the violence--Muslims claiming that after the </p><p>woman left they were attacked while at prayer, Christians </p><p>claiming that the Muslims used this as an excuse for "jihad." </p><p> It appears that members of the youth organizations on both </p><p>sides--the JDA and the PYC--took the lead in initiating and </p><p>expanding the violence. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U)  Unlike Kaduna, where there was mass destruction of </p><p>property, the destruction in Jos was selective, and localized </p><p>largely in Jos North and Bukaru, a southern suburb.  The </p><p>houses and businesses of the old Hausa families were </p><p>particularly targeted by Christians, while Muslims also </p><p>killed Christians and destroyed their property in </p><p>Hausa-dominated neighborhoods.  Throughout the town Poloff </p><p>observed burned-out tanker trucks and other large transport </p><p>vehicles, as well as burned fuel stations and car lots--all </p><p>businesses associated with Hausa traders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>The Military </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U)  The Third Armored Infantry Division, joined by some </p><p>personnel from the local Air Force base, were brought in  to </p><p>restore order on Saturday, September 8 (Ref C).  Reports of </p><p>their performance were largely positive.  It appears that </p><p>they did not use excessive lethal force, but were unable to </p><p>immediately stop the violence, since much of it was </p><p>surreptitious ethnic cleansing within neighborhoods rather </p><p>than large mob action.  Most sources report that by Sunday, </p><p>September 9, the killings had ceased in Jos.  On Wednesday, </p><p>September 12, some youths apparently took advantage of a </p><p>substantial downpour to loot shops in the market.  The </p><p>military were allegedly given the order on that day to shoot </p><p>to kill, and began a massive display of firepower that began </p><p>around 9:00 a.m. and ended around 3:00 p.m.  This effectively </p><p>stopped the looting.  Forces are reported to have fired their </p><p>weapons into the air, as well as into abandoned buildings, </p><p>while Jos residents cowered in their homes.  There were few </p><p>casualties reported by hospitals on Wednesday, including five </p><p>or six people injured by stray bullets.  Some Christians </p><p>reported that the flare-up on Wednesday was in response to </p><p>"jubilation" among Jos Muslims about the attack on the U.S. </p><p>on September 11.  This macabre claim, reported in some </p><p>newspapers as fact, was not borne out by our investigation. </p><p>Either false or wildly exaggerated, such stories are </p><p>indicative of the extent to which some predominantly </p><p>Christian ethnic groups, who are opposed to Islam and its </p><p>Hausa-speaking adherents, have seized on events in the U.S. </p><p>in an attempt to discredit their Muslim compatriots, and to </p><p>exacerbate conflict.  See septel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Casualties </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU)  Post has received reliable reports that the death </p><p>toll in Jos exceeds 2300, not counting what may have occurred </p><p>in surrounding areas.  Amcits confimed the large number of </p><p>casualties with eyewitness accounts of bodies being hauled </p><p>out of town in open-top cattle trucks, about the size of a </p><p>standard American semi-trailers, after the curfew was </p><p>imposed.  A colleague at the German Embassy reported that </p><p>Julius Berger Nigeria reported to him that they provided </p><p>earth-moving equipment to the military for digging mass </p><p>graves.  (Note: Nigerian officials, and the Army, have had </p><p>plenty of experience with the danger of bodies being </p><p>transported to other states, where they become the trigger </p><p>for reprisals and counter-reprisals.  In this case it was </p><p>prudent from a security standpoint to bury all bodies as soon </p><p>as possible, preventing them from being transported elsewhere </p><p>for burial, but also preventing an accurate assessment of the </p><p>loss of life.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C)  One Amcit missionary who works as a medical doctor </p><p>at the Jos University Teaching Hospital, one of two large </p><p>hospitals in town, reported that roughly eighty percent of </p><p>the casualties were Hausa, and the rest were spread among the </p><p>other ethnic groups.  Some Amcits reported pogroms against </p><p>Hausa-Fulani living in villages outside of Jos, where entire </p><p>village populations were murdered and their villages were </p><p>burned down.  Underlining the ethnic, rather than religious </p><p>nature of the conflict, one Amcit reported that he witnessed </p><p>Muslim Yoruba participating in killing their Hausa-Fulani </p><p>co-religionists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>Governmental Response </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (C)  Contacts in the Plateau State Government, including </p><p>Deputy Governor Michael Botmang, Secretary to State </p><p>Government Ezekiel Gomos, and the Permanent Secretary for </p><p>Security Matters, Robert Taple, all revealed strongly </p><p>pro-Christian biases regarding the violence in their </p><p>discussions with Poloff.  All repeated what can be called the </p><p>Christian exculpatory story: the Hausa were planning this, </p><p>they wanted to bring Shari\'a law to Plateau, they brought in </p><p>armed Muslim fighters from Niger and Chad to attack </p><p>Christians and take over Jos.  Unfortunately, this version of </p><p>events did not square with what the delegation from Abuja </p><p>witnessed on the ground, and the lack of objectivity on the </p><p>part of Plateau State\'s Christian-dominated government was </p><p>frankly disturbing.  Permanent Secretary Taple went so far as </p><p>to claim that a helicopter landed on the Bauchi Road (Jos </p><p>North) to supply weapons to the Muslims.  (Note:  Operation </p><p>Focus Relief has the only functioning helicopters in Nigeria </p><p>at the moment.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U)  Amcits complained of a lack of food in Jos, and said </p><p>that the food security problem was exacerbating the larger </p><p>security problem.  The delegation noted bags of corn, rice </p><p>and gari at Government House, which was to be distributed to </p><p>the hungry.  On Friday, September 14, there was no fuel to be </p><p>found in Jos, as the Hausa fuel distributors would not risk </p><p>sending another tanker truck after so many had been burned. </p><p>President Obasanjo visited Jos on Saturday, September 15, and </p><p>issued a press statement deploring the violence, and </p><p>instructing Governor Dariye that he would be "watching </p><p>closely" to see how things were handled by the current </p><p>Government there.  During a September 16 service at the </p><p>Presidential Villa commemorating the dead in New York, </p><p>Washington and Jos, Obasanjo talked of seeing evidence that </p><p>human beings had been eviscerated like animals.  The </p><p>President said the humanity of persons who could commit such </p><p>atrocities must be questioned. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (U)  Comment:  While the world\'s attention has been </p><p>understandably focused elsewhere, Nigeria has suffered its </p><p>worst bout of ethnic violence since the events in Kaduna in </p><p>Fegruary, 2000.  The death toll in Jos could well exceed </p><p>one-half of those killed in the U.S. in the attacks on New </p><p>York and Washington.  President Obasanjo\'s personal attention </p><p>to the situation in Plateau, although somewhat belated, was </p><p>encouraging.  Governor Ahmed Makarfi of Kaduna State reported </p><p>to Poloff that he and his colleagues in the North were </p><p>growing increasingly angry at what they perceive to be </p><p>Dariye\'s mishandling of the situation in Plateau, which may </p><p>have prompted the President\'s trip to Jos, and his warning </p><p>for the Governor.  Dariye\'s government has already lost </p><p>credibility as an impartial arbiter that can lead the way to </p><p>reconciliation, as was done in Kaduna, and his actions do not </p><p>appear to have slowed the pace of Hausa-Fulani refugees </p><p>departing Plateau State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (C)  Comment continued: Concern by both the Federal and </p><p>State governments over this crisis reflects long experience </p><p>with the cycle of ethnic reprisal and revenge in Nigeria. </p><p>The only way forward in Jos is for both sides to accept </p><p>responsibility and to work toward reconciliation.  The </p><p>Christians--in and out of Government--cling fiercely to the </p><p>notion that the Muslims planned this, started it </p><p>intentionally, and that Christians merely </p><p>responded--inflicting an 80 percent casualty rate on their </p><p>Hausa neighbors.  Irrespective of who started it, this does </p><p>not lay the foundation for reconciliation.  Unlike in Kaduna, </p><p>where losses were roughly equal and both sides quickly moved </p><p>to acknowledge their own responsibility, the unrest in Jos </p><p>has the appearance of ethnic cleansing, with the Hausas </p><p>taking the worst hit.  Because Hausa Muslims across the North </p><p>feel that their people were victimized in Jos, this conflict, </p><p>if not adequately addressed, will lay the foundation for </p><p>later Hausa reprisals, in Jos or elsewhere.  Many Nigerians </p><p>are worried, with good reason, that if this kind of carnage </p><p>can be triggered in traditionally peaceful Jos over the </p><p>appointment of a minor official, what will happen in hotspots </p><p>when campaigning for 2002 and 2003 elections begin in </p><p>earnest.  End Comment. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
