<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MANILA 013414 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, KISL, RP </p><p>SUBJECT:  DISCUSSION ON THE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT IN THE </p><p>-         PHILIPPINES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  MANILA 2840 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  DURING JULY 12 LUNCHEON MEETING WITH POLOFF, </p><p>RETIRED DE LA SALLE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR JOEL DE LOS </p><p>SANTOS DESCRIBED THE FUTURE PROSPECTS OF PEACE WITH THE </p><p>MUSLIM COMMUNITY AS LESS THAN ENCOURAGING.  HE FELT THAT A </p><p>MAIN PROBLEM WAS THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF MUSLIM </p><p>CULTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INDIGENOUS MUSLIM </p><p>SOCIETIES ON THE PART OF MAIN-LINE POLITICAL LEADERS, BOTH </p><p>MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN.  DE LOS SANTOS WAS AWARE OF HOUSE </p><p>SPEAKER DE VENECIA\'A EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF COL. QADHAFI AND </p><p>CLAIMED THAT LIBYA HAD DIRECTED FUNDS TO PRESIDENT RAMOS\' </p><p>1992 CAMPAIGN.  HE SAID HE HAD COMPLETED A STUDY OF THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS COMMISSIONED BY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR </p><p>JOSE ALMONTE, AND CONCLUDED THAT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE </p><p>MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (MNLF) WOULD PROBABLY NOT </p><p>PRODUCE A LASTING PEACE WITH THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. END </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>3.  POLOFF INVITED DE LOS SANTOS TO LUNCH TO CONTINUE AN </p><p>ACQUAINTANCE BEGUN THE PREVIOUS WEEK AT THE FIRST </p><p>CONFERENCE ON THE MUSLIM FUTURE (SEE REFTEL).  DE LOS </p><p>SANTOS IS A FORMER PROFESSOR AT DE LA SALLE UNIVERSITY </p><p>SPECIALIZING IN ISLAMIC AFFAIRS WHO NOW WORKS AS A </p><p>CONSULTANT.  HE CLAIMED TO BE CLOSE TO ALL FACETS OF THE </p><p>MUSLIM COMMUNITY, INCLUDING "BOTH ABOVE GROUND AND </p><p>UNDERGROUND" SECTORS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  DISCUSSING THE CONTINUING PROBLEM WITH AN EXTREMIST </p><p>INSURGENCY IN THE SOUTH, DE LOS SANTOS SAID THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAD LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS REALLY </p><p>HAPPENING IN THE MUSLIM REGIONS.  THE INSURGENTS HAVE BEEN </p><p>LABELED "ABU SAYYAF" BY THE MEDIA, BUT THAT ORGANIZATION </p><p>IS JUST THE SURFACE MANIFESTATION OF A MORE PROLONGED </p><p>PROCESS OF THE INSEEPAGE OF ISLAMIC THINKING BOTH AMONG </p><p>THE MUSLIM POPULATION AND ITS POLITICAL LEADERS.  THE </p><p>TENDENCY TO BRAND ALL ENEMIES WITH THE SAME BRUSH FAILED </p><p>TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE MANY DIFFERENCES WITHIN ISLAM; FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, HE SAID THAT THE LIBYAN BRAND OF "LITTLE GREEN </p><p>BOOK ISLAM" IS REGARDED WITH CONTEMPT BY PHILIPPINE </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISTS AS WELL AS MANY OF THEIR MUSLIM BRETHREN </p><p>IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  HE REFERRED TO THE LARGER PHENOMENON </p><p>OF INCREASED ISLAMIC CONSCIOUSNESS AND BUILDING OF </p><p>FUNDAMENTALIST MUSLIM COMMUNITIES AS AS THE "MOVEMENT" AND </p><p>SAID IT WAS CONNECTED TO THE EGYPTIAN-BASED MUSLIM </p><p>BROTHERHOOD SINCE 1988.  EXPOSURE TO ISLAMIC CULTURE </p><p>THROUGH EXPOSURE TO AND EDUCATION IN MUSLIM COUNTRIES HAS </p><p>SINCE THE 1960\'S AWAKENED THE PREVIOUSLY SLEEPY ISLAMIC </p><p>CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE BANGSA MORO (MUSLIM PEOPLE) OF THE </p><p>PHILIPPINES. </p><p> </p><p>5.  THERE WERE ALSO HUNDREDS OF MUSLIM TEACHERS WORKING AS </p><p>"TABLEEGH" -- IN ESSENCE, ISLAMIC MISSIONARIES -- ALL OVER </p><p>MINDANAO.  SEVERAL HUNDRED SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN HAVE ALSO </p><p>BEEN SENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS OF TRAINING IN ARAB </p><p>COUNTRIES.  THE GENERAL TREND WAS AWAY FROM SECULARIZATION </p><p>-- PRECISELY THAT TENDENCY REPRESENTED BY THE MORO </p><p>NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (MNLF) WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>WAS CONDUCTING PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.  IN HIS ESTIMATION, </p><p>ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF TODAY\'S MUSLIM COMMUNITY REFLECTS </p><p>"FUNDAMENTALIST" VIEWS, ABOUT 20 PERCENT SECULAR ONES, AND </p><p>THE REMAINDER IS IN THE MIDDLE.  IN COMPARISON, HE </p><p>ESTIMATED THE MUSLIM LEADERSHIP AS DIVIDED ABOUT 40 </p><p>PERCENT EVENLY BETWEEN SECULARISTS AND FUNDAMENTALISTS, </p><p>WITH THE REMAINDER IN THE MIDDLE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACCORDING TO DE LOS SANTOS, A NUMBER OF MUSLIMS SENT </p><p>TO ASSIST THE "MOVEMENT" WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED BY POLICE </p><p>AND IDENTIFIED AS "JORDANIANS" ARE ACTUALLY PALESTINIANS, </p><p>AND THOSE PARTIAL TO HAMAS RATHER THAN THE PLO.  HE IS IN </p><p>TOUCH WITH SOME OF THEIR COMPATRIOTS IN MANILA WHO ARE </p><p>DEGREE CANDIDATES AT LOCAL UNIVERSITIES.  THEY ARE PART OF </p><p>A GROWING WORLD-WIDE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT THAT SEEKS TO CREATE </p><p>MUSLIM COMMUNITIES GOVERNED BY MUSLIM LAW.  DE LOS SANTOS </p><p>SAID THAT THE ULTIMATE GOAL DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A SEPARATE </p><p>MUSLIM STATE.  THE MOVEMENT HAS SET UP A NUMBER OF LOCAL </p><p>SELF-HELP ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES WHERE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IS WEAK, SUCH AS LOCAL HEALTH CARE. MONEY FOR </p><p>THEIR ACTIVITIES WAS "NO PROBLEM." </p><p> </p><p>7.  DE LOS SANTOS DISCLOSED THAT JOSE ALMONTE, THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, HAD ASKED HIM LAST </p><p>FEBRUARY TO WRITE AN ANALYSIS OF THE PEACE PROCESS AND </p><p>WHERE IT WAS HEADING.  HE SAID ALMONTE IS A CLOSE FRIEND </p><p>WHO WAS A MEMBER OF THE SAME UNIVERSITY GRADUATING CLASS. </p><p>ALMONTE\'S LETTER, THE ORIGINAL OF WHICH DE LOS SANTOS </p><p>SHOWED POLOFF, ASKED HIM TO ANALYZE THE BASIC POLITICAL </p><p>STRUCTURES IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY, LIKELIHOOD OF COMING </p><p>TO AN AGREEMENT, AND STEPS THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT TAKE.  DE </p><p>LOS SANTOS TOOK SEVERAL MONTHS TO COMPLETE THE STUDY, BUT </p><p>SAID HE PULLED SOME OF HIS PUNCHES IN THE FINAL REPORT. </p><p>SUMMARIZING HIS FINDINGS, HE EXPRESSED DOUBTS THAT THE </p><p>MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (MNLF) WOULD BE COMPETENT </p><p>ENOUGH TO HOLD POWER IF GRANTED IT THROUGH THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS, AND DOUBTED THAT THE MNLF IN ANY CASE COULD </p><p>NEGOTIATE PEACE ON BEHALF OF ALL FILIPINO MUSLIMS, SINCE </p><p>THE MNLF IS REALLY "PAST HISTORY" THAT IS BECOMING </p><p>INCREASINGLY IRRELEVANT AND LOOKED UPON AS A SURROGATE FOR </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>8. IN DISCUSSING HOUSE SPEAKER JOSE DE VENECIA, DE LOS </p><p>SANTOS HAD STRONG WORDS FOR THIS "DEMAGAGOIC POLITICIAN." </p><p>HE SAID DE VENECIA HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN SHADY DEALINGS IN </p><p>BOTH LIBYA AND IRAQ INVOLVING CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS FOR </p><p>HIS FIRM, AND HAD TRIED TO "REPAY" HIS LIBYAN BENEFACTORS </p><p>BY ACTING AS THEIR FRONT MAN AND ERRAND BOY.  THE LIBYANS </p><p>THOUGHT THEY COULD USE DE VENECIA\'S AID IN ENLISTING </p><p>PRESIDENT FIDEL RAMOS, WITH HIS EXCELLENT AMERICAN </p><p>CONTACTS, AS A WEDGE IN HELPING END LIBYA\'S DIPLOMATIC </p><p>ISOLATION IN THE WEST.  (EMBASSY HAS REPORTED EXTENSIVELY </p><p>ON DE VENECIA\'S EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF COL. QADHAFI).  IT </p><p>WAS A WELL-KEPT SECRET, ACCORDING TO DE LOS SANTOS, THAT </p><p>RAMOS HAD RECEIVED FIVE MILLION PESOS (ABOUT DOLS 200,000) </p><p>FROM THE LIBYANS TO FINANCE HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN </p><p>1992. </p><p> </p><p>9.  ACCORDING TO DE LOS SANTOS, MOST RESIDENT AMBASSADORS </p><p>OF ISLAMIC COUNTRIES ARE MODERATES, INCLUDING LIBYAN RAJAB </p><p>ABDULAZIZ AZZAROUQ, WHO HE SAID IS A CANDIDATE FOR THE </p><p>PH.D. DEGREE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE </p><p>PHILIPPINES.  HE SAID THAT ABOUT A QUARTER OF LIBYAN </p><p>LARGESSE TO THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY COMES THROUGH THE "BACK </p><p>DOOR." </p><p> </p><p>10.  COMMENT:  DE LOS SANTOS\' VIEWS REPRESENT THOSE OF A </p><p>MUSLIM INTELLECTUAL WITH CLOSE TIES TO NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>ADVISOR ALMONTE.  HIS NEGATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CHANCES </p><p>FOR SUCCESS IN THE PEACE PROCESS WITH THE MNLF IS NOT </p><p>REFLECTED IN THE PROGRESS BEING SHOWN TO DATE, ALTHOUGH </p><p>THE QUESTION WHICH HE ADDRESSES -- WHETHER A SUCCESSFUL </p><p>NEGOTIATION WITH THE MNLF WILL USHER IN A LONG-TERM PERIOD </p><p>OF PEACE WITH THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY -- IS ONE THAT NEEDS TO </p><p>BE ADDRESSED.  HIS WARNING ABOUT THE TREND AWAY FROM </p><p>SECULARIZATION AND TOWARD TRADITIONALISM BY YOUNG MUSLIMS </p><p>IS A POINT WE HAVE HEARD BEFORE.  HOWEVER, THE VIEW HELD </p><p>BY MANY OF OUR INTERLOCUTORS IS THAT THE TREND IS TOWARD </p><p>INCREASING RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS RATHER THAN VIOLENT </p><p>FUNDAMENTALISM.  THIS TREND OBVIOUSLY DESERVES CAREFUL </p><p>WATCHING, AS DO THE DEVELOPING TIES BETWEEN FILIPINO </p><p>MUSLIMS AND THEIR BRETHREN IN OTHER COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
