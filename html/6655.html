THE MAIN ELEMENTS WERE THE </p><p>FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE START AND PROGRESS OF THE "PRINCIPAL AIR AND </p><p>LAND ATTACK ON IRAQ," ACCORDING TO SEMI-OFFICIAL </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI AND CENTER-LEFT, </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-DUSTOUR, WHICH </p><p>INDEPENDENT, MASS-APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM </p><p>REFERRED TO AS: "BARBARIC BOMBING SETS BAGHDAD\'S NIGHT </p><p>ABLAZE." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE DEMONSTRATIONS IN JORDAN, WHICH RESULTED IN </p><p>SOME INCIDENTS WITH THE POLICE IN AMMAN, WHEN </p><p>DEMONSTRATORS CHANTED: "SO WHERE IS THE ARAB ARMY?" </p><p>[THE OFFICIAL NAME OF THE JORDANIAN ARMED FORCES,] AND </p><p>IN THE TRIBAL CITY OF MA\'AN.  THE KING GAVE AN ADDRESS </p><p>IN WHICH ASSURED JORDANIANS THAT: "OUR SENTIMENTS ARE </p><p>IDENTICAL TO YOURS" AND ENJOINED THEM TO EXPRESS THEIR </p><p>SENTIMENTS IN A PEACEFUL AND CIVILIZED MANNER.  IN </p><p>COVERING THE DEMONSTRATIONS, THE DAILIES USED THE TERM </p><p>"AGGRESSION AGAINST IRAQ" IN DESCRIBING THE CONFLICT. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS STATED THAT JORDAN </p><p>HAS NOT RECEIVED A REQUEST FROM THE U.S. TO EXPEL </p><p>IRAQI DIPLOMATS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE REFUGEE CAMPS AT RUWEISHED, WHERE REFUGEES </p><p>(NON-IRAQI ) PRAISED THE JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES FOR </p><p>RECEIVING THEM. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE POSITIONS OF DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS, MAINLY </p><p>THOSE OF FRANCE AND RUSSIA, AS WELL AS THE VATICAN. </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL COMMENTARY </p><p>-- THE MOST DANGEROUS FOR WORLD PEACE </p><p>LEADING DAILY COLUMNIST FAHED AL-FANEK WROTE IN SEMI- </p><p>OFFICIAL INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON MARCH 22: </p><p>"ALTHOUGH AMERICAN IMPERIALISM WAS AN ACCUSATION </p><p>LEVELED AGAINST THE U.S. DURING THE COLD WAR, IT HAS </p><p>NOW DEVELOPED INTO AN OPEN CALL BY THE NEO- </p><p>CONSERVATIVES, WHO WANT THE U.S. TO TAKE THIS UNIQUE </p><p>HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY FOR DOMINATING THE FIVE </p><p>CONTINENTS WITH A MILLION-MAN ARMY, AND TO ASSUME THE </p><p>RIGHT TO REPLACE REGIMES THAT IT DOES NOT LIKE, WITH </p><p>LACKEYS.  THE WORLD, THEREFORE, STARTED TO SEE BUSH AS </p><p>THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN FOR WORLD PEACE, AND THE U.S. </p><p>AS THE MOST DANGEROUS STATE TO WORLD PEACE.  EVENTS </p><p>NOW PROVE THIS OUTLOOK." </p><p> </p><p>-- THE TRINITY OF LOBBIES IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST MALIK ATHAMNEH WROTE IN SEMI-OFFICIAL </p><p>INFLUENTIAL ARABIC DAILY AL-RAI ON MARCH 22: "BUSH AND </p><p>BIN LADEN ARE ALIKE ON ONE VERY CRUCIAL POINT, THEIR </p><p>WILL TO DIVIDE THE WORLD INTO TWO CAMPS, \'WITH US AND </p><p>AGAINST US.\'  THIS LEAVES MOST OF US ON THE MARGIN OF </p><p>EVENTS, IN THE EPICENTER OF CONFLICT.  THERE IS A </p><p>DIABOLICAL ALLIANCE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION COMPOSED </p><p>OF THE TRINITY OF ZIONIST CHRISTIAN EVANGELISM, THE </p><p>GIANT ECONOMIC LOBBY, AND THE EVER-PRESENT ZIONIST </p><p>LOBBY THAT SERVES ONLY ISRAEL." </p><p> </p><p>-- OBSERVATIONS ON THE MARGIN OF STEADFASTNESS </p><p>DAILY COLUMNIST NAHED HATTAR WROTE IN INDEPENDENT, </p><p>MASS-APPEAL ARABIC DAILY AL-ARAB AL-YAWM ON MARCH 22: </p><p>"WHAT MATTERS NOW IS THAT THERE ARE MEN WHO ARE </p><p>FIGHTING TO DEFEND THE TERRITORY, DIGNITY, AND FUTURE </p><p>OF IRAQ AND ALL THE ARABS.  THE WILL TO FIGHT IS THE </p><p>ONLY HOLY THING AT A HISTORIC MOMENT THAT WILL STAY </p><p>WITH US FOR A LONG TIME YET.  THIS MESSAGE WILL NOT </p><p>REACH THE AMERICANIZED AND RUSTY HEARTS AND MINDS OF </p><p>THE PSEUDO-INTELLECTUALS WHO THEORIZE TO JUSTIFY </p><p>SURRENDER AND SLAVERY, BUT IT HAS REACHED THE HEARTS </p><p>AND MINDS OF THE CHILDREN OF EGYPT.  SO FAR THERE HAS </p><p>NOT BEEN A SINGLE OFFICIAL CONDEMNATION OF THE </p><p>AGGRESSION AGAINST IRAQ.  NOT A SINGLE CALL, OR AT </p><p>LEAST A PLEA TO STOP THE MILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST </p><p>OUR BROTHERS.  NOT A SINGLE HINT THAT THE ANGLO- </p><p>AMERICAN WAR ON IRAQ IS BEING CONDUCTED OUTSIDE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY.  COULD WE NOT AT LEAST </p><p>REGURGITATE THE DECLARATIONS OF THE ARAB SUMMIT AT </p><p>SHARM EL-SHEIKH, WHICH WE APPROVED?" </p><p> </p><p>-- THE AGGRESSION HAS STARTED </p><p>ATEF AL-JOLANI, CHIEF EDITOR OF ASSABEEL (INDEPENDENT </p><p>WEEKLY REFLECTING THE VIEWS OF THE ISLAMIC ACTION </p><p>FRONT) WROTE ON MARCH 22: "THE AGGRESSION HAS STARTED, </p><p>AND THE RABID AMERICAN MISSILES WERE LAUNCHED AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ, TO DESTROY IT AND KILL ITS PEOPLE BEFORE </p><p>OCCUPYING IT.  THE IRAQI PEOPLE STAND ALONE FACING THE </p><p>AGGRESSION, AND WE REGRET THAT WE CAN DO NOTHING BUT </p><p>WATCH, OBSERVE, AND STAY MESMERIZED BEFORE SATELLITE </p><p>TV STATIONS TO FOLLOW THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS OF THE </p><p>AGGRESSION.  OF COURSE, ARAB LEADERS ARE IN THE SAME </p><p>BOAT, EXCEPT THAT WE HOPE AND PRAY THAT BUSH AND BLAIR </p><p>WILL PAY FOR THEIR WICKED DEEDS, WHILE OUR LEADERS </p><p>HOPE AND PRAY THAT THE PROBLEM OF IRAQ WILL BE OUT OF </p><p>THE WAY VERY SOON.
