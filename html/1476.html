<p>S E C R E T KINSHASA 000300 </p><p> </p><p>KUALA LUMPUR PLEASE PASS TO AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/17/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: GDRC CLAIMS KABILA ALIVE </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA BARRIE WALKLEY FOR REASONS 1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS WAS SUMMONED TO THE OAU VILLAGE </p><p>EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON OF JANUARY 17. PRESIDENTIAL CHEF DE </p><p>CABINET GEORGES BUSE PRESIDED OVER THE MEETING AND READ A </p><p>SHORT COMMUNIQUE; HE WAS FLANKED BY GENERAL EDDY KAPEND AND </p><p>KABILA ADVISOR AND COUNSEL JEAN MBUYU. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) BUSE SAID KABILA WAS WOUNDED IN THE JANUARY 16 </p><p>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, GIVEN INITIAL MEDICAL TREATMENT IN </p><p>KINSHASA AND THEN FLOWN "OUT OF THE COUNTRY" FOR ADDITIONAL </p><p>MEDICAL TREATMENT, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS DOCTOR AND THE MINISTER </p><p>OF HEALTH. (NOTE: BUSE DID NOT IDENTIFY THE DESTINATION, BUT </p><p>EVERYONE ASSUMES IT TO HAVE BEEN HARARE.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) THE GDRC HAD THIS MORNING DECIDED IN AN EXTRAORDINARY </p><p>SESSION OF MINISTERS, BUSE SAID, THAT UNTIL KABILA IS ABLE TO </p><p>RETURN, HIS SON -- GENERAL JOSEPH KABILA -- WOULD ACT AS </p><p>COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) BUSE SAID THE GDRC URGED CALM AND A RETURN TO </p><p>NORMALCY.  THE GDRC CONSEQUENTLY HAD TAKEN TWO DECISIONS: THE </p><p>AIRPORTS WILL BE REOPENED AND THE CURFEW RELAXED (NEW CURFEW </p><p>HOURS ARE TO BE 2200-0500). </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) BUSE CONCLUDED HIS REMARKS BY SAYING THE GDRC WISHES </p><p>KABILA A PROMPT RECOVERY. </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) AT THE END OF THE MEETING, THE DIPS WERE LINED UP AND </p><p>IN WALKED JOSEPH KABILA TO SHAKE EVERYONE\'S HAND.  CHARGE </p><p>TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT HIS HAND ON KABILA\'S </p><p>SHOULDER; HE DID NOT APPEAR INJURED IN ANY WAY (CONTRARY TO </p><p>SOME RUMORS THAT HE HAD BEEN SHOT). </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) WHEN CHARGE WAS WALKING OUT, HE WAS APPROACHED </p><p>SEPARATELY BY JEAN MBUYU AND VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>ILUNGA AWAN.  BOTH DISCREETLY SAID THAT JOSEPH KABILA SEEKS A </p><p>PRIVATE MEETING WITH CHARGE THIS AFTERNOON OR EVENING (TIME </p><p>NOT YET IDENTIFIED) AND ASKED THAT THIS BE KEPT IN </p><p>CONFIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: IT IS DIFFICULT AT THE MOMENT TO DETERMINE </p><p>THE TRUTH.  IS KABILA ALIVE, OR IS THIS SIMPLY A CYNICAL GDRC </p><p>LINE DESIGNED TO EARN ADDITIONAL TIME FOR MANEUVER? </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: WHATEVER THE TRUTH ABOUT KABILA\'S </p><p>CONDITION, THE CHOICE OF JOSEPH KABILA AS INTERIM HEAD OF </p><p>GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE AN ASTUTE MOVE.  NO DOUBT THOSE </p><p>BEHIND THE SCENE SEE HIM AS A MALLEABLE FIGUREHEAD WHO IS </p><p>PRESENTABLE TO THE PEOPLE (AND WHO, FOR THE TIME BEING AT </p><p>LEAST, MAKES POSSIBLE A PUBLIC PAPERING-OVER OF THE SERIOUS </p><p>MILITARY AND POLITICAL SPLITS IN THE GDRC). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WALKLEY </p><p></p></div>
