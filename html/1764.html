HAMILTON FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5(B) AND 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: ALEJANDRO TOLEDO WAS TENACIOUS IN HIS </p><p>STRUGGLE TO REACH THE PRESIDENCY AND WILL APPLY THE SAME </p><p>TENACITY TO SUCCEED IN OFFICE.  HE COMES TO OFFICE WITH NO </p><p>GOVERNMENT OR MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE, HOWEVER, AND HIS </p><p>PROPENSITY TO BE A ONE-MAN SHOW CAN BE A NAGGING </p><p>SHORTCOMING.  NONETHELESS, IN OUR VIEW, HE WILL ULTIMATELY </p><p>EXERCISE SOUND JUDGMENT.  HE FACES THE PRESSURE OF </p><p>EXORBITANT CAMPAIGN PROMISES, EXPECTATIONS THAT A VICTORY </p><p>FOR DEMOCRACY CAN SPEEDILY RESOLVE PERU\'S ILLS, AND </p><p>POLITICAL DEBTS.  HE ALSO FACES DIFFICULT ECONOMIC </p><p>CONDITIONS.  IT IS THE ECONOMY WHERE HE WILL FOCUS, WHILE </p><p>TRYING TO GIVE OTHER PRIORITIES, SUCH AS JUDICIAL AND </p><p>MILITARY REFORM, THEIR DUE.  INTERNATIONALLY, HE WILL </p><p>PURSUE AN INDEPENDENT COURSE, WHICH NEVERTHELESS WILL BE IN </p><p>ACCORD WITH US MUCH OF THE TIME, AND BE LESS CONCERNED </p><p>ABOUT BEING IN LOCKSTEP WITH PERU\'S NEIGHBORS.  WHETHER HIS </p><p>GOVERNMENT SUCCEEDS OR FAILS WILL ALSO BE SEEN AS A TEST </p><p>FOR DEMOCRACY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>GOVERNING STYLE </p><p>=============== </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        LIMA  03418  01 OF 03  191454Z </p><p>2.  (C) WHEN ALEJANDRO TOLEDO ASSUMES THE PRESIDENCY JULY </p><p>28, HE WILL BRING TO OFFICE A STRONGLY PERSONAL ONE-MAN </p><p>STYLE.  DECISION-MAKING WILL RESIDE WITH HIM AS IT HAS </p><p>DURING THE CAMPAIGN.  ALTHOUGH HE TALKS A GOOD GAME ABOUT </p><p>EMPOWERING HIS MINISTERS, TOLEDO HAS NOT PROVEN ABLE TO </p><p>DELEGATE AUTHORITY.  A SOLITARY LEADER, HE DOES NOT EASILY </p><p>EXTEND HIMSELF OR HIS TRUST TO OTHERS.  CLOSEST TO HIM IS </p><p>HIS WIFE, ELIANE KARP.  NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF HER </p><p>INFLUENCE HAVE LED THE TOLEDO CAMP TO LOWER HER PROFILE </p><p>TEMPORARILY, BUT HER INFLUENCE IS SIGNIFICANT AND WILL </p><p>LIKELY GROW. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) ALSO AFFECTING TOLEDO\'S PERSONAL STYLE IS HIS NEED </p><p>FOR AFFIRMATION, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL.  AT HOME, THIS </p><p>CHARACTERISTIC, ACCORDING TO CRITICS, BRINGS HIM TO THE </p><p>BORDERS OF A MESSIANIC COMPLEX.  AFTER THE VINDICATION OF </p><p>HIS ROLE IN RETURNING DEMOCRACY TO PERU, TOLEDO NOW SEES </p><p>HIMSELF AS SINGLE-HANDEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR LIFTING PERU OUT </p><p>OF POVERTY OR, AT A MINIMUM, OUT OF ECONOMIC RECESSION. </p><p>THE TEST OF THE TOLEDO GOVERNMENT ON ECONOMIC ISSUES IS </p><p>ALSO THE TEST OF TOLEDO THE MAN - HIS PERSONAL SUCCESS OR </p><p>FAILURE BOUND UP WITH THAT OF HIS GOVERNMENT.  ON THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SCENE, TOLEDO\'S NEED FOR APPROVAL INFLUENCES </p><p>HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE USG.  HE HARBORS SOME RESENTMENT, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WE DID NOT BACK HIM OPENLY WHEN HE </p><p>OPPOSED FUJIMORI AND SOUGHT INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION.  HE </p><p>WILL EXPECT TO BE TREATED ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH WORLD </p><p>LEADERS, INCLUDING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, AND WILL USE THE </p><p>ATTENTION ACCORDED HIM BY OTHERS, REGARDLESS OF THE MERITS </p><p>OF THE COMPARISON, AS A BASELINE. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        LIMA  03418  01 OF 03  191454Z </p><p>4.  (C) THE POSITIVE SIDE OF TOLEDO\'S INDIVIDUALISM IS HIS </p><p>TENACITY AND HIS DETERMINATION TO SUCCEED.  HE IS PROUD OF </p><p>BEING A FIGHTER, DEMONSTRATED IN HIS TWO-YEAR STRUGGLE TO </p><p>GET TO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.  HE COMES TO THE JOB, </p><p>HOWEVER, WITH NO EXPERIENCE AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL OR IN </p><p>MANAGEMENT.  THIS SHORTCOMING WILL MAKE THE DECISION-MAKING </p><p>PROCESS IN TOLEDO\'S GOVERNMENT APPEAR DYSFUNCTIONAL, BUT WE </p><p>BELIEVE TOLEDO\'S DECISIONS ON THE KEY ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE </p><p>TO THE U.S. WILL ULTIMATELY BE THE RIGHT ONES. </p><p> </p><p>PRESSURES </p><p>========= </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) CHIEF AMONG THE PRESSURES TOLEDO WILL FACE ARE THE </p><p>EXPECTATIONS HE HAS RAISED WITH HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES. </p><p>NEWSPAPERS HAVE PUBLISHED LISTS OF THEM AND THERE ARE MANY </p><p>THAT WILL BE KEEPING SCORE.  ONE ANTI-TOLEDO DAILY, FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, DID NOT WAIT A DAY AFTER THE JUNE 3 ELECTIONS TO </p><p>HIGHLIGHT THAT TOLEDO ADVISORS HAD ALREADY BACKTRACKED ON </p><p>TWO PROMISES RELATED TO TAXES.  TOLEDO\'S POPULAR SUPPORT </p><p>WILL HELP HIM WEATHER MUCH OF THE CRITICISM, AT LEAST IN </p><p>THE FIRST THREE TO SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE.  HE IS AWARE THAT </p><p>HE HAS TO BE PUBLICLY AGGRESSIVE IN REDUCING THOSE </p><p>EXPECTATIONS, AND HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO DO SO, SPEAKING OF </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8213 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        LIMA  03418  02 OF 03  191454Z </p><p>ACTION WHA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00 </p><p>      H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OIG-03   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00 </p><p>      PC-01    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      NFAT-00  SAS-00     /013W </p><p>                  ------------------FAC8F9  191454Z /38 </p><p>P 191453Z JUN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY LIMA </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0718 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ASUNCION </p><p>AMEMBASSY BOGOTA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRASILIA </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUENOS AIRES </p><p>AMEMBASSY CARACAS </p><p>AMEMBASSY GUATEMALA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LA PAZ </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMEMBASSY MEXICO </p><p>AMEMBASSY MONTEVIDEO </p><p>AMEMBASSY QUITO </p><p>AMEMBASSY SANTIAGO </p><p>USCINCSO MIAMI FL </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 LIMA 003418 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        LIMA  03418  02 OF 03  191454Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/11/06 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, PHUM, KDEM, PHUM, KDEM, PE, PEPGOV, PEPGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: TOLEDO AT THE HELM </p><p> </p><p>THE NEED FOR PATIENCE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THERE IS ALSO THE QUESTION OF WHAT HE MAY OWE </p><p>POLITICALLY TO HIS CAMPAIGN\'S SUPPORTERS.  WITH ONLY </p><p>RUDIMENTARY CAMPAIGN FINANCING RULES, THERE IS LITTLE </p><p>INFORMATION ABOUT POSSIBLE FINANCIAL BACKERS AND THEIR </p><p>INTERESTS.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS </p><p>GEORGE SOROS\' OPEN SOCIETY PROVIDED FOR THE JULY 2000 ANTI- </p><p>FUJIMORI PROTESTS (CUATRO SUYOS), ONLY MEDIA BUSINESSMAN </p><p>BARUCH IVCHER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A CONTRIBUTOR.  THERE </p><p>ARE RUMORS THAT ANOTHER, SOMEWHAT UNSAVORY BUSINESSMAN, </p><p>LEON RUPP, HAS BEEN A MAJOR BACKER.  RAUL DIEZ CANSECO, THE </p><p>FIRST VP FROM AN OLD, WEALTHY LIMA FAMILY, ALSO HELPED TO </p><p>BANKROLL TOLEDO\'S CAMPAIGN. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) TOLEDO\'S MOST PROMINENT POLITICAL DEBT IS TO </p><p>MORALIZING INDEPENDENT FRONT (FIM) LEADER FERNANDO OLIVERA. </p><p>FIM PLAYED THE CAMPAIGN ATTACK DOG AGAINST APRA\'S ALAN </p><p>GARCIA AND PLEDGED ITS ELEVEN LEGISLATORS TO BACK TOLEDO IN </p><p>THE CONGRESS.  OLIVERA, HOWEVER, IS NOT VIEWED AS A </p><p>RELIABLE POLITICAL PARTNER (REFTEL).  THE KEY FOR TOLEDO </p><p>WILL BE TO BALANCE ANY REWARDS FOR OLIVERA AGAINST </p><p>MAINTAINING COHESION IN HIS OWN PARTY\'S RANKS.  WITHOUT THE </p><p>FIM, THE ONLY OTHER SUBSTANTIAL CONGRESSIONAL BLOC TOLEDO </p><p>HAS SUCCESSFULLY COURTED, TOLEDO\'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA MAY </p><p>SUFFER. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        LIMA  03418  02 OF 03  191454Z </p><p>YES, IT\'S THE ECONOMY </p><p>===================== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) TOLEDO WILL FOCUS HIS ENERGIES ON THE ECONOMY, </p><p>WHERE HE IS DESPERATE TO GET POSITIVE GROWTH FAST.  HE HAS </p><p>STAKED MUCH ON REVITALIZING THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR, </p><p>GENERATING EMPLOYMENT AND BRINGING PERU OUT OF RECESSION. </p><p>HE HAS A SOLID, IF SOMEWHAT ECLECTIC, ECONOMIC TEAM AND IS </p><p>BANKING ON THE LYNCHPIN CABINET APPOINTMENT OF WELL KNOWN </p><p>INVESTMENT BANKER PEDRO PABLO KUCZYNSKI.  HIS TWO VICE </p><p>PRESIDENTS, RAUL DIEZ-CANSECO AND DAVID WAISMAN, BRING </p><p>BUSINESS EXPERIENCE TO THE LEADERSHIP TEAM. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) THE ANTENNAE ARE OUT, HOWEVER, FOR POSSIBLE TURNING </p><p>POINTS IN HOW TOLEDO HANDLES ECONOMIC MATTERS WHEN THESE </p><p>ARE TOUGH ISSUES AND POTENTIALLY COMPETING ADVICE AND </p><p>INTERESTS.  ONE FEAR IS THAT HE MAY RESORT SIMPLY TO HIS </p><p>OWN ECONOMICS EXPERTISE RATHER THAN RELYING ON OR LISTENING </p><p>TO ADVISORS.  ANOTHER IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE MAY BEGIN </p><p>TO PURSUE POPULIST MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO SOCIO-ECONOMIC </p><p>PRESSURES AS HIS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM EITHER TAKES </p><p>LONGER THAN EXPECTED OR DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) NON-DOMESTIC FACTORS, BEYOND TOLEDO\'S CONTROL, </p><p>WILL ALSO INFLUENCE HOW HE DOES ON THE ECONOMY.  ON A </p><p>MACRO-LEVEL, A SLOW DOWN IN THE U.S. AND WORLD ECONOMIES </p><p>WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT.  IF THE U.S. ECONOMY </p><p>SLIDES, EVEN GOOD DECISIONS MAY NOT HAVE THE DESIRED </p><p>EFFECT.  WORLD PRICES FOR PERU\'S COMMODITIES AND THE </p><p>POSSIBLE RETURN OF THE DESTRUCTIVE EL NINO WEATHER PATTERN </p><p>ARE ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT PERU\'S GROWTH IN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        LIMA  03418  02 OF 03  191454Z </p><p>THE COMING YEARS.  MORE SPECIFICALLY, HOW THE ANDEAN TRADE </p><p>PREFERENCES ACT (ATPA) FARES IN THE U.S. CONGRESS WILL ALSO </p><p>BE IMPORTANT. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMY, WE CAN EXPECT TOLEDO </p><p>TO DEVOTE ATTENTION TO JUDICIAL REFORM AND TO THE MILITARY. </p><p>THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY HAS RECEIVED A STRONG </p><p>BOOST UNDER THE PANIAGUA GOVERNMENT AND IT IS LIKELY TO </p><p>REMAIN ON THE SAME TRACK UNDER TOLEDO.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>ALTHOUGH JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE HAS BEEN LARGELY RESTORED TO </p><p>THE STATUS QUO ANTE FUJIMORI, THE PERUVIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM </p><p>REMAINS IN DIRE NEED OF RADICAL REFORM AND MODERNIZATION. </p><p>THE MILITARY, DISCREDITED FOR ITS CORRUPT LINKS TO FORMER </p><p>INTELLIGENCE ADVISOR VLADIMIRO MONTESINOS, FACES AN </p><p>UNSYMPATHETIC MASTER IN TOLEDO.  HE HAS PUT THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES ON NOTICE ABOUT PURSUING CORRUPTION AND ABUSES, </p><p>FAVORS MILITARY BUDGET CUTS AND WILL PRESS FOR GREATER </p><p>CIVILIAN CONTROL. </p><p> </p><p>TOLEDO ON THE WORLD STAGE </p><p>========================= </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) TOLEDO IS UNLIKELY TO PURSUE POLICIES INIMICAL TO </p><p>THE UNITED STATES.

IN COUNTER NARCOTICS, FOR EXAMPLE, </p><p>TOLEDO WILL LIKELY SUPPORT COCA ERADICATION, BUT HE WILL </p><p>INSIST ON CREATING JOBS FOR FORMER COCA GROWERS.  TO ASSIST </p><p>THESE FARMERS, TOLEDO WILL LIKELY ARGUE FOR TRADE </p><p>PREFERENCES ON TEXTILES AND OTHER PRODUCTS.  IN SUPPORTING </p><p>ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT, TOLEDO WILL FAVOR ALTERNATIVE </p><p>CROPS, BUT HE MAY PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL PRICE SUPPORTS. </p><p>OVERALL, TOLEDO HAS INDICATED HE WILL TAKE A HARD LINE </p><p>AGAINST NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) UNLIKE THE INTERIM PANIAGUA GOVERNMENT, WHICH </p><p>FAVORED WORKING IN CONSENSUS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS REGARDLESS </p><p>OF DIFFERENCES, TOLEDO WILL PLAY A MORE INDEPENDENT ROLE IN </p><p>REGIONAL RELATIONS.  LINKS WITH BRAZIL WILL NEED REPAIR </p><p>AFTER THE RECENT HISTORY OF BRAZILIAN FAVORING OF FUJIMORI </p><p>AND OF ONE OF TOLEDO\'S FIRST ROUND OPPONENTS, LOURDES </p><p>FLORES NANO.  SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO LOVE LOST WITH </p><p>VENEZUELA\'S HUGO CHAVEZ, REGARDED BY TOLEDO AND MANY IN HIS </p><p>CAMP AS THE ANTI-DEMOCRAT.  IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE </p><p>COMMON PERCEPTION THAT, IN PART THANKS TO CHAVEZ, </p><p>MONTESINOS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REMAINING A FUGITIVE. </p><p> </p><p>BOTTOM LINE </p><p>=========== </p><p> </p><p>14.

BUT </p><p>THERE IS MORE AT STAKE IN PERU THAN WHETHER TOLEDO SUCCEEDS </p><p>OR FAILS.  THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS GAVE PERUVIANS A CHOICE </p><p>BETWEEN TWO -- FOR MANY UNPALATABLE -- CANDIDATES.  HOW </p><p>WELL TOLEDO FARES WILL ALSO BE SEEN AS A TEST FOR DEMOCRACY </p><p>IN PERU AND THE REGION. </p><p> </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
