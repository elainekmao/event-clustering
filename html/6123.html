<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 001406 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR U/S TAYLOR AND OASIA - MILLS </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY\'S ECONOMY MARCH 5 AM:  MARKETS BEGIN TO </p><p>RALLY ON HOPES OF SECOND RESOLUTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1378 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified, and not for internet </p><p>distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Turkish financial markets improved </p><p>throughout the morning of March 5, and at mid-day appeared </p><p>poised to continue a rally.  Yields on T-bills strengthened </p><p>five percentage points in morning trading.  This positive </p><p>market sentiment is based on two statements indicating that </p><p>the GOT will seek a second parliamentary resolution.   First, </p><p>on March 4 evening, AK Chairman Erdogan told the AK </p><p>parliamentary group that "daily emotions" should not be the </p><p>basis of national decision-making, and that the MPs should </p><p>take decisions based on the country\'s future.  Second, at </p><p>mid-day March 5, TGS Chief of Staff Ozkok told the press the </p><p>military had the same view as the GOT regarding the </p><p>parliamentary resolution on troop deployments.  Also on March </p><p>5, Deputy PM Sener defended the 2003 budget macro-economic </p><p>targets, especially the 5 percent growth target, against </p><p>press criticism.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Markets Up On Erdogan and Ozkok Statements </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  At mid-day March 4, Turkish markets had rebounded </p><p>from the lows of Monday morning March 3 and appeared poised </p><p>to continuing strengthening. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The benchmark T-bill (maturity of March 3, 2004) </p><p>strengthened 5 percentage points in morning trading, from </p><p>yesterday\'s 62.5 percent to 57 percent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The lira appreciated about one percent, closing at TL </p><p>1,621,000 to the dollar. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The Istanbul stock exchange was flat in morning trading, </p><p>but analysts say it will jump up following the noon lunch </p><p>break. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Chief of Staff Ozkok Statement Supportive of GOT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Before meeting with Northern Cyprus leader Rauf </p><p>Denktas in early afternoon March 5, TGS Chief of Staff Hilmi </p><p>Ozkok issued a press statement that addressed in part the </p><p>troop deployment parliamentary resolution.  Ozkok said: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "The Turkish military\'s view is the same as the </p><p>Government\'s view as reflected in our government\'s resolution </p><p>submitted to our parliament." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Erdogan\'s General Statements Underpin </p><p>Local Market Optimism </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Behind market optimism lies AK chairman Erdogan\'s </p><p>statements on the evening of March 4 to his parliamentary </p><p>group.  These general statements, well covered on TV and </p><p>newspapers March 5, are being interpreted by markets here as </p><p>indicating his intention to force a second parliamentary vote </p><p>once he becomes PM.  Locals see an implied threat that those </p><p>AK MPs who don\'t vote with him will "not be fulfilling the </p><p>responsibilities placed on us by the people." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) Following are the parts of Erdogan\'s speech to the AK </p><p>parliamentary group reported in local press as "on the </p><p>subject of the second parliamentary resolution": </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "Those who hold positions of responsibility must not rely </p><p>on daily emotions when making steps forward.  It is </p><p>imperative to take decisions aimed at managing the country\'s </p><p>future." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "I also understand my friends\' hesitations.  But if we </p><p>don\'t look at issues from all perspectives, we can\'t fulfill </p><p>the responsibilities placed on us by the people and we can\'t </p><p>do our duties." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Erdogan also had an implied warning for the U.S., per the </p><p>local press, when he told press before the Group meeting, </p><p>"For Turkey\'s own security and the territorial integrity of </p><p>Iraq, we will not remain observers.  ON the subject of </p><p>intervening to address problems, which method will be applied </p><p>will be decided in the coming days." </p><p>Deputy PM Sener Defends Macro Targets </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) On March 5 morning, Deputy Prime Minister Sener </p><p>defended the 2003 budget\'s macro-economic targets against </p><p>recent press criticism.  He stressed there is no plan to </p><p>revise the 5 percent growth or other targets.  Speaking </p><p>before the Ankara Chamber of Industry, he said: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  The fiscal saving measures announced by the government </p><p>(note:  a total of TL 15.8 quadrillion or nearly $10 billion, </p><p>reftel) will not lead to a contraction of domestic demand and </p><p>will not slow the growth rate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  "There is no problem in reaching the year-end inflation </p><p>targets" (note:  targets are 20 percent CPI and 17.4 percent </p><p>WPI, though first two months WPI is already over 8 percent.) </p><p>WPI will drop in coming months, he predicted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--  Asked about the high interest rates in the March 4 </p><p>Treasury debt auctions, he said expects rats to decline in </p><p>coming months and not to present debt roll-over problems. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
