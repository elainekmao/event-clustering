SUMMARY: AN UNDATED WHITE PAPER ENTITLED </p><p>"TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS AND AGRICULTURE: A TIME </p><p>FOR CHOICES" WAS PUT INTO CIRCULATION IN </p><p>ITALY AFTER MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE GIANNI </p><p>ALEMANNO PRESENTED AN OUTLINE OF THIS </p><p>STRATEGY AT AN AGRICULTURAL FAIR IN THE </p><p>SECOND WEEK OF MARCH. THIS PAPER RECOUNTS THE </p><p>HISTORY OF AND DEFENDS THE ITALIAN BAN ON </p><p>FOUR EU-APPROVED GM CORN VARIETIES AND </p><p>SUGGESTS IT BE CONTINUED UNDER PLANNED EU </p><p>RULE CHANGES. FURTHERMORE, THE PAPER SUGGESTS </p><p>NATIONAL LEGISLATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED </p><p>THAT WOULD RESTRICT THE ITALIAN MARKET TO </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY BEYOND PROPOSED EU NORMS. IT </p><p>EMPHASIZES THE NEED FOR TRACEABILITY AND </p><p>LABELING LAWS. </p><p>2.  THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE UNIQUE </p><p>GEOGRAPHY OF ITALY, THE SMALL AGRICULTURAL </p><p>LAND HOLDINGS WHICH BORDER ON ONE ANOTHER AND </p><p>THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, AND THE NEED TO </p><p>PRESERVE REGIONAL AND TYPICAL PRODUCTS OF </p><p>HIGH VALUE IN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MARKETS </p><p>MEANS THAT THE MARKET NICHE HELD BY ITALIAN </p><p>QUALITY PRODUCTS COULD BE DAMAGED BY THE </p><p>INTRODUCTION OF BIOTECHNOLOGY.  CONVERSELY, A </p><p>DECISION TO MAKE ITALIAN AGRICULTURE GMO </p><p>FREE, COULD STRENGTHEN THE NICHE MARKET </p><p>OCCUPIED BY ITALIAN QUALITY PRODUCTS.

THE PAPER CAME TO US FROM ASSOBIOTEC AND </p><p>MONSANTO, ORIGINATING FROM THE MINISTRY OF </p><p>AGRICULTURE U/S AMBROSIO. WE UNDERSTAND THAT </p><p>THE PAPER WILL BE USED TO INITIATE A PUBLIC </p><p>DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT TOWARD THE END OF APRIL. </p><p>COMMENT: BECAUSE THERE ARE FEW POLITICIANS </p><p>WHO WILL RISK TAKING A POSITION AGAINST THE </p><p>ANTI-BIOTECH CROWD, ONCE DEBATED PUBLICLY IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT IT WILL BE HARD TO ENLIST SUCH </p><p>SUPPORT. IF DEBATE TRANSFORMS THE PAPER INTO </p><p>GOI POLICY BY LEGISLATION OR DECREE, IT </p><p>THREATENS, AT A MINIMUM, U.S. SOY AND CORN </p><p>SEED IMPORTS, AND SOYBEAN AND MEAL IMPORTS, </p><p>WORTH ABOUT DOLS 150 MILLION, OR ABOUT ONE </p><p>FOURTH OF THE VALUE OF U.S. FOOD AND FEED </p><p>EXPORT MARKET TO ITALY. END COMMENT.  EMBASSY </p><p>ROME IS CONFERRING WITH INTERLOCUTORS AND IN </p><p>A SEPTEL WILL REPORT THE REACTION OF FARM </p><p>INTEREST GROUPS. POST HAS EXPRESSED CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT THE PAPER TO THE PRIME MINISTER\'S </p><p>OFFICE AND HAS RECEIVED ASSURANCES THAT THOSE </p><p>CONCERNS WILL BE ADDRESSED. </p><p> </p><p>4. THE PAPER STATES THAT EU LEGISLATION DOES </p><p>NOT SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICT GMO "CONTAMINATION" </p><p>FROM ENTERING THE FOOD CHAIN. COMMENT: THIS </p><p>IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC PAPER. IN FACT THIS WHITE </p><p>PAPER REBUFFS SCIENTIFIC REASONING ON AG </p><p>BIOTECH AS USELESS AND REPETITIVE.

BY </p><p>OMITTING ANY SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS OR </p><p>CONSIDERING THE BENEFITS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, </p><p>THE PAPER IS ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A SIMPLISTIC </p><p>ARGUMENT WHICH PORTRAYS BIOTECHNOLOGY AS A </p><p>THREAT TO ITALIAN HIGH VALUE PRODUCTS, AND </p><p>THAT BY EXCLUDING THEM ITALY WILL PURSUE AN </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE ITALY\'S INTERNATIONAL </p><p>REPUTATION. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT </p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY HOLDS NO PROMISE, AND INDEED IS </p><p>A THREAT TO ITALIAN CONSUMERS, THE ITALIAN </p><p>ECONOMY, AND ITALIAN FOOD PRODUCERS.  THE </p><p>PAPER\'S INTENT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE TITLE, </p><p>IS TO ESTABLISH A NEED FOR NATIONAL </p><p>REGULATIONS TO FURTHER RESTRICT EU </p><p>LEGISLATION ON BIOTECH TOLERANCES, TO OPPOSE </p><p>BIOTECH APPROVALS, AND TO ENHANCE </p><p>TRACEABILITY AND LABELING.

INCREASING YIELDS MAKES SENSE </p><p>ON A GLOBAL SCALE, BUT IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE </p><p>IN EVERY AGRICULTURAL SETTING. IN THE ITALIAN </p><p>AGRICULTURAL COMPLEX, BIOTECH SHOULD BE </p><p>SCRUTINIZED ACCORDING TO ITALY\'S </p><p>CHARACTERISTICS: ITS PREDILECTION FOR NICHE </p><p>PRODUCTS, THE TOPOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT; </p><p>SOCIAL ASPECTS INCLUDING HOW CONSUMERS VIEW </p><p>AGRICULTURE, THE PRESENCE OF BIOTECH IN FEED </p><p>INGREDIENTS, THE ROLE OF RESEARCH AND </p><p>EXPERIMENTATION; AND EU LEGISLATIVE NORMS, </p><p>ESPECIALLY THOSE REGARDING THE SEED REGIME. </p><p>AGRICULTURE IN THE EU COMMUNITY IS ALLOWING A </p><p>PROGRESSIVE PENETRATION BY BIOTECHNOLOGY </p><p>WHICH WILL DEPRIVE CITIZENS AND THOSE WHO </p><p>WORK IN AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES FROM A CHOICE </p><p>TO REMAIN GMO-FREE. </p><p> </p><p>7. QUALITY FOOD </p><p>THE FOOD AND BEVERAGE INDUSTRY SECTOR </p><p>CONTRIBUTES 23 PERCENT TO ITALIAN GNP. THE </p><p>"QUALITY" OR "TRADITIONAL" FOOD PRODUCTS HAVE </p><p>EARNED ITALY A REPUTATION THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>WORLD. HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS UNDER PROTECTION </p><p>OF GEOGRAPHIC INDICATIONS OR OTHER </p><p>DESIGNATIONS REPRESENT 15 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01457  02 OF 04  211633Z </p><p>VALUE OF TOTAL FOOD PRODUCTION. THESE COULD </p><p>BE THE ENGINE FOR MORE VALUE ADDED IF THE </p><p>EXPORT OF "QUALITY" PRODUCTS EXPANDS. THERE </p><p>ARE 114 PRODUCTS UNDER EU PROTECTION BY </p><p>DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN, GEOGRAPHICAL </p><p>INDICATION, OR TRADITIONAL SPECIALTY.  ADD TO </p><p>THIS 440 WINES WITH VARIOUS DESIGNATIONS. BY </p><p>GETTING MORE PRODUCTS TO COME UNDER PROTECTED </p><p>DESIGNATIONS, WHETHER BY VIRTUE OF ITALY\'S </p><p>AGRICULTURAL TRADITIONS OR BY THE OTHER </p><p>DEFINITIONS, ITALY COULD BOOST THE </p><p>UNPROTECTED INTO THE REALM OF THE PROTECTED. </p><p>GLOBALIZATION HAS THE OPPOSITE POTENTIAL;  IT </p><p>COULD DEGRADE THESE UNIQUE PRODUCTS INTO THE </p><p>REALM OF THE COMMONPLACE AND BORING. THE </p><p>OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF </p><p>ITALIAN PRODUCTION BY PROMOTING ITALIAN </p><p>PRODUCTS OF HIGH, GMO-FREE QUALITY. </p><p> </p><p>8. DOWNSIDE POTENTIAL ON IMAGE OF ITALIAN </p><p>PRODUCTS </p><p>ANYTHING NEGATIVE THAT MIGHT DETRACT FROM THE </p><p>WHOLESOMENESS OR THE QUALITY OF A PRODUCT </p><p>SHOULD BE AVOIDED. BIOTECHNOLOGY COULD MAR </p><p>THE BIOLOGICAL PATRIMONY OF THE AGRICULTURAL </p><p>COMPLEX. ITALIAN CONSUMERS ARE INCREASINGLY </p><p>SENSITIVE TO TYPICAL PRODUCTION AND </p><p>HEALTHFULNESS OF FOOD, NOT JUST DUE TO FOOD </p><p>EMERGENCIES. THIS IS ALSO THE RESULT OF </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE INCREASED </p><p>CONSUMERS\' DISPOSABLE INCOME AND </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01457  02 OF 04  211633Z </p><p>SOPHISTICATION. THERE IS NO TURNING BACK FROM </p><p>THIS INCREASED AWARENESS. AGRICULTURE IS NO </p><p>LONGER SOLELY THE PROVIDER OF SUSTENANCE, IT </p><p>ALSO PROVIDES PEOPLE WITH COLLECTIVE GOODS </p><p>SUCH AS CONSERVATION OF NATURE AND THE </p><p>ENVIRONMENT, OF THE COUNTRYSIDE AND FOOD </p><p>TRADITIONS.  SOCIETY LOOKS TO AGRICULTURE TO </p><p>SATISFY ITS NEED FOR QUALITY OF LIFE. </p><p> </p><p>9. BIODIVERSITY AND GENE FLOW </p><p>ITALY\'S HILLY TOPOGRAPHY AND ITS AGRICULTURE </p><p>GIVE IT UNIQUE TERRITORIAL CHARACTERISTICS. </p><p>THE MIX OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL </p><p>ENVIRONMENTS MEANS THAT THEY SHARE BORDERS </p><p>WHICH WOULD HAVE EFFECTS ON EACH OTHER. ALSO, </p><p>THE DIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURE WITHIN SMALL </p><p>TERRITORIAL CONFINES COULD BE EFFECTED BY THE </p><p>CHOICE OF BIOTECH PRODUCTION. IN ITALY IT </p><p>WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ISOLATE METHODS OF </p><p>CULTIVATION BY DISTANCES BETWEEN THE </p><p>DIFFERENT TYPES, INCLUDING ORGANIC </p><p>AGRICULTURE. ITALY\'S ORGANIC FOOD INDUSTRY, </p><p>THE LARGEST IN EUROPE, CANNOT PERMIT </p><p>CONTAMINATION BY BIOTECH PRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>10.

ITALIAN </p><p>AGRICULTURE\'S OBJECTIVE IS NOT TO INCREASE </p><p>PRODUCTION. IT IS TO PRODUCE QUALITY </p><p>PRODUCTS. ITALIAN CITIZENS DON\'T BELIEVE THEY </p><p>ARE GOING TO FACE ANY GAPS BETWEEN FOOD </p><p>SUPPLY AND DEMAND. REFERENCE IS MADE TO AN </p><p>OCTOBER 2001 OPINION POLL WHICH IS GIVEN AS </p><p>EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE HOPE FOR BIOTEC </p><p>H </p><p>ONLY IN MEDICINE AND SCIENCE OR IF IT COULD </p><p>BE USED TO ADDRESS FAMINE. AS FOR ITALIAN </p><p>CONSUMERS, BIOTECH SHOWS PROMISE FOR </p><p>EXPERIMENTATION OUTSIDE OF AGRICULTURE OR TO </p><p>RESOLVE PROBLEMS WHICH ITALIANS DON\'T FACE. </p><p>THE SAME STUDY IS CITED AS SAYING THAT THE </p><p>MINORITY WHO FAVOR BIOTECH LOOK AT </p><p>QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE LINKED TO INCREASES IN </p><p>YIELDS OR REDUCTIONS IN THE COST OF </p><p>PRODUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>11. SEEDS FOR PLANTING </p><p>WHEN ACCIDENTAL CONTAMINATION IS IN SEEDS FOR </p><p>PLANTING, THESE ARE PARTICULARLY THREATENING. </p><p>THIS CAN LEAD TO A LACK OF CONTROL OVER </p><p>PROPAGATED SPECIES. THE LACK OF NATIONALLY </p><p>PRODUCED SEEDS FREE FROM GMOS MEANS ITALY </p><p>MUST RELY ON IMPORTED SEED. THIS IS TRUE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01457  03 OF 04  211633Z </p><p>ESPECIALLY FOR SOY AND CORN. NATIONAL </p><p>PRODUCTION ONLY COVERS 30 PERCENT AND 50 </p><p>PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE DEMAND FOR </p><p>THESE SEEDS.  TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT IN </p><p>SEED PRODUCTION WOULD REQUIRE THAT SEED </p><p>PRODUCTION MUST INCREASE. ALTERNATIVELY, </p><p>ITALY COULD LOOK FOR SEED SOURCES FROM </p><p>COUNTRIES WHICH CAN GUARANTEE GMO-FREE SEEDS. </p><p>THE USE OF UNPOLLUTED-BY-BIOTECH SEEDS SHOULD </p><p>BE ASSURED. </p><p> </p><p>12. VULNERABILITY FROM FEED IMPORTS; THE AIMS </p><p>OF EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL POLICY </p><p>THE WORLD\'S EXPANSION OF ACREAGE UNDER </p><p>BIOTECH PRODUCTION IS IN A FEW COUNTRIES AND </p><p>CONCERNS ONLY A HANDFUL OF CROPS. OF THESE </p><p>ITALY IS MOST "VULNERABLE" TO CONTAMINATION </p><p>FROM SOY AND CORN. MOST BIOTECH CROPS ARE </p><p>HERBICIDE RESISTANT OR INSECT RESISTANT, </p><p>CHARACTERISTICS THAT AIM TO INCREASE </p><p>PRODUCTION AND LOWER COST. IN CONTRAST, </p><p>EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED </p><p>TO LIMIT PRODUCTION AND TO IMPROVE QUALITY. </p><p>MOREOVER, ITALIAN AGRICULTURE IS THE CHIEF </p><p>PROVIDER OF ORGANIC PRODUCTION IN THE EU. </p><p>EUROPEAN CONSUMERS WANT HIGH QUALITY, </p><p>HEALTHFUL, GENUINE FOOD. ITALIAN PRODUCTS </p><p>SHOULD AIM TO SATISFY THAT CONSUMER DEMAND. </p><p> </p><p>13.

BIOTECH RESEARCH </p><p>IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO ADVANCED BIOTECH </p><p>RESEARCH EVEN WITHOUT PRODUCING TRANSGENIC </p><p>ORGANISMS.  PUBLIC RESOURCES CAN BE USED FOR </p><p>PRUDENT RESEARCH, TO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE </p><p>WITHOUT GOING INTO THE REALM OF AGRICULTURAL </p><p>RISK.  THIS CALL TO CAUTION, COMBINED WITH </p><p>THE ABSENCE OF NEED TO INCREASE ITALIAN </p><p>YIELDS OR LOWER COSTS, CALLS INTO QUESTION </p><p>FURTHER DEBATE BY SCIENTISTS. A HYPOTHETICAL </p><p>RESEARCH PLAN SHOULD HAVE THREE PRIORITIES: </p><p>PROTECTING AND IMPROVING THE BEST VARIETIES, </p><p>EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF TRANSGENIC </p><p>ORGANISMS, AND PROTECTING THE CONSUMER. </p><p> </p><p>15.
