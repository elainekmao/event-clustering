(C)  ON A MARCH 11-12 VISIT TO ROME, SA/PAB DEPUTY </p><p>DIRECTOR STEVE MCGANN MET WITH MFA OFFICIALS, REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>OF FORMER AFGHAN KING ZAHIR SHAH, AND ZAHIR SHAH HIMSELF. </p><p>MCGANN AND SA/PD DEPUTY DIRECTOR SUSAN HOVANEC CLOSED OUT AN </p><p>ESF GRANT OFFERED TO THE KING\'S ASSOCIATION TO PROMOTE THE </p><p>EMERGENCY LOYA JIRGA, DEMOCRACY, AND WOMEN\'S PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN (REFS A, B), RETURNING SOME $280,000 TO THE USG </p><p>FOR FURTHER ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY IN AFGHANISTAN. </p><p>DURING THE MEETING WITH THE FORMER KING, ZAHIR SHAH ALLUDED </p><p>TO EVOLVING EXPECTATIONS OF THE ROLE HE WOULD PLAY UPON HIS </p><p>RETURN TO AFGHANISTAN, PORTRAYING HIMSELF -- "IF THE AFGHAN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01644  01 OF 03  030823Z </p><p>PEOPLE WANT IT" -- AS POSSIBLY A HEAD OF STATE A LA THE </p><p>FRENCH PRESIDENT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>CHANNEL MONEY INSIDE AFGHANISTAN </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>2.  (SBU)  IN THEIR MEETING WITH MFA COORDINATOR FOR </p><p>AFGHANISTAN ENRICO DI MAIO, MCGANN AND HOVANEC DISCUSSED THE </p><p>NEED FOR THE USG TO RE-PROGRAM REMAINING MONEYS FROM A GRANT </p><p>AWARDED TO THE ZAHIR SHAH ASSOCIATION FOR PEACE AND </p><p>SELF-DETERMINATION IN AFGHANISTAN FOR FURTHER WORK INSIDE </p><p>AFGHANISTAN TOWARD THE SAME PURPOSES -- DEMOCRACY BUILDING </p><p>AND INCREASED CIVIL PARTICIPATION BY AFGHAN WOMEN.  DI MAIO </p><p>SAID THE GOI WOULD LET THE KING\'S ASSOCIATION TAKE ANYTHING </p><p>USEFUL PROVIDED BY THE GOI, SUCH AS COMPUTERS, WITH THEM TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN, BUT ITALY, TOO, WAS PLANNING ON ENDING DIRECT </p><p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE KING AND HIS ASSOCIATES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  DI MAIO SAID THE REALITY IN AFGHANISTAN WAS THAT </p><p>THOSE WHO CONTINUED TO RECEIVE OUTSIDE SUPPORT, SUCH AS </p><p>FORMER PRESIDENT RABBANI, WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO </p><p>SEEK -- AND OBTAIN -- INSIDE SUPPORT:  SIMPLY PUT, TO BUY </p><p>LOYA JIRGA (LJ) VOTES.  IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE AIA </p><p>CHAIRMAN KARZAI ALSO HAD ACCESS TO FUNDS, AT LEAST THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT FUNDS AVAILABLE TO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT.  THE </p><p>PROPER DEPLOYMENT OF THOSE FUNDS BY THE AIA WOULD </p><p>LEGITIMATELY STRENGTHEN KARZAI\'S POSITION.  MCGANN CONVEYED </p><p>THE USG INTENT TO SUPPORT PREPARATION AND HOLDING OF THE LJ, </p><p>BUT NOTED THAT OTHER COUNTRIES MUST SHARE COSTS WHICH COULD </p><p>BE SIGNIFICANT.  DI MAIO SAID THE GOI HAD NOT YET CONSIDERED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01644  01 OF 03  030823Z </p><p>FUNDING OF THE LJ, BUT HE HOPED TO BRING THIS UP FOR </p><p>FINANCING CONSIDERATION.  ITALY, TOO, MUST PAY ITS SHARE, HE </p><p>SAID; "WITH YOU, WE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA."  HE SUGGESTED </p><p>THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ALSO CONSIDER USING FOREIGN </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO ENCOURAGE THE KIND OF COOPERATION THAT BEGAN IN </p><p>BONN.  AIA DEFENSE MINISTER FAHIM, INTERIOR MINISTER QANOONI, </p><p>AND FOREIGN MINISTER ABDULLAH SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED, IF NEED </p><p>BE UNDER THREAT OF AN END TO FINANCIAL SUPPORT, TO TELL </p><p>RABBANI TO STOP INTERFERING IN EFFORTS TO SET UP THE LOYA </p><p>JIRGA. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  DI MAIO UNDERSCORED ITALY\'S INTEREST IN FUNDING </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF AFGHANISTAN\'S ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, </p><p>PREFERABLY IN COORDINATION WITH THE USG.  "NO ONE ELSE BUT </p><p>THE TWO OF US IS THINKING ABOUT THIS," HE ASSERTED.  HE </p><p>MENTIONED THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT LAW INSTITUTE (IDLI) </p><p>AS A POSSIBLE VEHICLE.  HOVANEC NOTED THERE SHOULD BE GROWING </p><p>INTEREST IN SUCH WORK AMONG NGO\'S; REPORTING ON PROBLEMS IN </p><p>THIS SPHERE HAS INCREASED.  IN RESPONSE TO MCGANN\'S QUERY, DI </p><p>MAIO CLARIFIED THAT ITALY WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE THE LEAD </p><p>IN JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENT.  (N.B.  THE IDLI CONTINUES ITS WORK </p><p>ON A DATABASE AND ANALYSIS OF PAST AFGHAN CONSTITUTIONS AND </p><p>CODES; SEE REF C.) </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ4228 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  01644  02 OF 03  030823Z </p><p>ACTION SA-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   MFA-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EAP-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00 </p><p>      PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   DRL-02   G-00 </p><p>      SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------7E3AEE  030824Z /40 </p><p>P 030659Z APR 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 3066 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY ISLAMABAD PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY KABUL PRIORITY </p><p>AMCONSUL PESHAWAR PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ALMATY </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ASHGABAT </p><p>AMEMBASSY BEIJING </p><p>AMEMBASSY BERLIN </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY NEW DELHI </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY TASHKENT </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  01644  02 OF 03  030823Z </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 001644 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>ALMATY FOR EMBASSY DUSHANBE </p><p>NSC FOR KHALILZHAD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/02/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, EAID, AF, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN:  ZAHIR SHAH\'S FUTURE PLANS, CLOSING </p><p>OUT ESF GRANT TO ZAHIR SHAH FOUNDATION </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  AS A RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN </p><p>MCGANN AND ZALMAI RASSOUL (THE FORMER KING\'S EXECUTIVE </p><p>SECRETARY AND AIA AVIATION MINISTER), GRANT EXPERTS MUELLER </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>AND SNEARLY WORKED WITH ZAHIR SHAH\'S REPRESENTATIVES TO BEGIN </p><p>AUDITING EXPENDITURES UNDER THE ORIGINAL GRANT AND DETERMINE </p><p>THE AMOUNT OF MONEY REMAINING.  THE  ASSOCIATION  RETURNED </p><p>UNUSED FUNDS IN THE AMOUNT OF $117,675 TO THE USG AND URGED </p><p>THAT THESE MONEYS BE USED "TO PURSUE THE FULL PARTICIPATION </p><p>OF AFGHAN WOMEN IN ALL ASPECTS OF CIVIL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC </p><p>AND SOCIAL LIFE IN AFGHANISTAN."  THE AGREEMENT FURTHER </p><p>SPECIFIES THAT, "IN LIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY\'S IMMINENT RETURN TO </p><p>AFGHANISTAN AND THE CESSATION OF THE ASSOCIATION\'S ACTIVITIES </p><p>IN ROME, ITALY," THE REMAINING FUNDS "BE USED TO COMMENCE </p><p>WORK WITHIN AFGHANISTAN." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>KING\'S PLANS FOR HIS RETURN </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>6.  (C)  DCM, MCGANN, AND HOVANEC MET WITH FORMER KING ZAHIR </p><p>SHAH ON MARCH 12 TO CONFIRM THE DECISION TO CLOSE OUT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  01644  02 OF 03  030823Z </p><p>GRANT AND DISCUSS THE KING\'S FUTURE PLANS.  BOTH SIDES SHARED </p><p>APPRECIATION FOR THEIR ONGOING COOPERATION TO LIBERATE </p><p>AFGHANISTAN FROM THE SCOURGE OF TERRORISM AND EXTREMISM AND </p><p>TO BUILD A DEMOCRATIC AND PROGRESSIVE ISLAMIC STATE.  MCGANN </p><p>NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF NEXT STEPS IN IMPLEMENTING THE BONN </p><p>AGREEMENT AND OF THE SYMBOLIC ROLE THE KING WOULD PLAY IN </p><p>OPENING THE LOYA JIRGA.  HE ASKED WHAT THE KING WOULD </p><p>PERCEIVE AS A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME FROM THE LJ.  THE KING </p><p>REPLIED THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN FAR AWAY, THE AFGHAN PEOPLE </p><p>HAD MAINTAINED CONFIDENCE IN HIM.  HE HOPED TO BE OF USE TO </p><p>HIS COUNTRYMEN IN FULFILLING THEIR ASPIRATIONS.  HIS MOST </p><p>IMPORTANT EFFORT WOULD BE TO MAINTAIN HARMONY AND HELP TO </p><p>PROVIDE SECURITY AND PEACE TO THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN.  HE </p><p>HOPED TO BRING UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN DIFFERENT ETHNIC </p><p>ELEMENTS AND AFGHANS PURSUING "DIFFERENT POLICIES."  "I OFFER </p><p>MYSELF IN SERVICE TO THE AFGHAN NATION IN ANY ROLE OR SERVICE </p><p>THE PEOPLE WANT, AS DETERMINED BY THE LOYA JIRGA," ZAHIR </p><p>CONCLUDED. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  MCGANN NOTED THAT THE KING HAD SAID HE DID NOT </p><p>INTEND TO SEEK A ROLE IN GOVERNMENT OR TO PLAY A ROLE IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN\'S TRANSITIONAL AUTHORITY.  WAS THIS STILL HIS </p><p>PERSPECTIVE?  GENERAL WALI, THE KING\'S SON-IN-LAW AND </p><p>INTERPRETER (COMMENT:  SOMETIMES SUSPECTED OF INSERTING HIS </p><p>OWN VIEWS IN THE TRANSLATIONS), ASKED WHETHER THIS QUESTION </p><p>REFERRED TO THE KING\'S PLAYING AN EXECUTIVE ROLE, SUCH AS A </p><p>PRIME MINISTER OR FOREIGN MINISTER, OR A HEAD OF STATE ROLE, </p><p>SUCH AS THE BRITISH KING OR THE FRENCH PRESIDENT.  HOW DOES </p><p>THE KING SEE HIMSELF, MCGANN REPEATED.  THE KING AND/OR WALI </p><p>HEDGED, BUT THROUGH THE COURSE OF DISCUSSION REVEALED AN </p><p>EVOLUTION IN THE KING\'S -- OR HIS ENTOURAGE\'S -- PERCEPTION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  01644  02 OF 03  030823Z </p><p>OF HIS ROLE TO INCLUDE CONSIDERATION OF HIS POSITION AS A </p><p>RELATIVELY ACTIVE HOS WITH NOT INSIGNIFICANT AUTHORITY TO </p><p>REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL CREATION OF A PERMANENT GOVERNMENT.  BY </p><p>THE END OF THE CONVERSATION, THE KING WAS QUITE CLEAR HE </p><p>WOULD CONSIDER A FUTURE HOS ROLE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE </p><p>FRENCH PRESIDENT. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  DCM ASKED THE KING WHETHER HE BELIEVED OUTSIDE </p><p>INTERFERENCE CONTINUED TO BE A PROBLEM IN AFGHANISTAN.  ZAHIR </p><p>SHAH NOTED THAT INTERFERENCE BY IRAN, PAKISTAN, THE UK UNDER </p><p>THE TIMES OF BRITISH INDIA, HAD ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  HE WELCOMED MCGANN\'S REFERENCE TO THE </p><p>SIX-PLUS-TWO\'S REAFFIRMATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF </p><p>NON-INTERFERENCE, BUT SAID IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED </p><p>AND OBSERVED.  RELATIONS WITH IRAN HAD IMPROVED, BUT NOW </p><p>SEEMED ON THE BASIS OF REPORTS HE RECEIVED FROM INSIDE </p><p>AFGHANISTAN TO BE DETERIORATING AGAIN. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  MCGANN RETURNED TO THE KING\'S ROLE IN THE LJ.  THE </p><p>USG APPRECIATED THE KING\'S STATEMENTS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>WOMEN IN AFGHANISTAN\'S RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION.

THE KING "AGREED ENTIRELY."  HE </p><p>THEN REPEATED THE SHOCK HE HAD FELT AT THE TALIBAN\'S </p><p>DESTRUCTION OF THE BAMIYAN BUDDHAS, A GESTURE WHICH "HURT THE </p><p>WHOLE CIVILIZED WORLD."  THE BLOWING UP OF THE STATUES WAS </p><p>MORE THAN CULTURAL DESTRUCTION, MCGANN ADDED.  IT REPRESENTED </p><p>INTOLERANCE.  THE USG HOPED THE KING WOULD ALSO USE HIS </p><p>INFLUENCE TO EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR TOLERANCE AND RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM.  "WE HAVE SO MANY IMPORTANT PROBLEMS TO SOLVE," </p><p>ZAHIR SHAH AGREED.  "THAT IS WHY I RETURN, TO ENCOURAGE THAT </p><p>THESE PROBLEMS BE SOLVED IN A CIVILIZED WAY."  AFGHANS WERE </p><p>ALWAYS A TOLERANT PEOPLE, HE EXPLAINED, WHO WERE ONLY MISLED </p><p>BY POOR AND INTOLERANT EDUCATION.  HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT HE </p><p>COULD HELP TO RECTIFY MISTAKES MADE (UNDER THE TALIBAN </p><p>REGIME, ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SAY SO DIRECTLY.) </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  ZAHIR SHAH REITERATED HIS APPRECIATION FOR U.S. </p><p>SUPPORT, SAYING THE U.S. "STOOD UP SO OFTEN WHEN THE WORLD </p><p>WAS IN DANGER."  THE U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN IS </p><p>WELCOME; AFGHANS APPRECIATE THOSE WHO ARE FIGHTING AND HAVE </p><p>SHED THEIR BLOOD FOR AFGHANISTAN.
