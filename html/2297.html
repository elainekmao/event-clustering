<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 006470 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); NEA/NGA </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN MESSAGE NO. 219/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/11/11 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, RM, VT </p><p>SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON\'S MEETING WITH PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE </p><p> </p><p>REF: VATICAN 06036 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  06470  131632Z </p><p>(A) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) AMBASSADOR PAID COURTESY CALL ON THE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOG, </p><p>CARDINAL FRANCIS ARINZE.  CARDINAL ARINZE IS ONE OF ONLY </p><p>TWO BLACK AFRICANS IN THE ROMAN CURIA (REF).  THE </p><p>CARDINAL DISCUSSED THE COUNCIL\'S COORDINATION OF DIALOG </p><p>WITH ALL NON-CHRISTIAN RELIGIONS.  THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS </p><p>DIALOG WITH THE JEWISH COMMUNITY, WHICH ALONG WITH NON- </p><p>CATHOLIC CHRISTAN DENOMINATIONS, IS CONDUCTED BY THE </p><p>COUNCIL FOR CHRISTAN UNITY.  ARINZE FURTHER EXPLAINED </p><p>THAT THE COUNCIL GREW OUT OF THE SECOND VATICAN COUNCIL </p><p>IN WHICH IT WAS DECIDED TO TRY TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER </p><p>RELIGIOUS BODIES TO FOSTER BETTER UNDERSTANDING BY </p><p>EMPHASIZING WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON, AND HOW THEY CAN </p><p>BETTER SERVE MANKIND JOINTLY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CARDINAL ARINZE\'S BIGGEST ACCOUNT IS DIALOG WITH </p><p>THE MUSLIMS.  THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY, WITH 18% OF THE </p><p>WORLD\'S POPULATION, IS THE SECOND LARGEST WORLD RELIGION </p><p>AFTER CHRISTIANITY WHICH COMPOSES 33%. HE STATED THAT TWO </p><p>AREAS IN WHICH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WISHES TO CHANGE </p><p>CURRENT MUSLIM THINKING IS THAT OF 1)EDUCATION AND </p><p>2)RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  THE VATICAN IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT </p><p>THE MUSLIM RELIGIOUS EDUCATION SYSTEM WHICH PORTRAYS </p><p>CHRISTIANS AS THE "ENEMY"; AND WITH THE LACK OF RELIGIOUS </p><p>FREEDOM IN MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES. </p><p>3. (C) THE CARDINAL USED THE OCCASION TO AGAIN EXPRESS </p><p>HIS CONDOLENCES FOR THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACK.  HE SAID IT </p><p>WOULD BE A "DISASTER" IF THE CONCEPT OF HUNTINQTON\'S </p><p>"CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS" WERE TO BECOME A REALITY.  HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  06470  131632Z </p><p>WENT ON TO STATE, HOWEVER, THAT THE U.S. MUST REALIZE </p><p>THAT IF THE PALESTINIAN/ISRAELI CONFLICT WERE SETTLED AND </p><p>IF THE EMBARQO AQAINST IRAQ WERE LIFTED, MUCH OF THE </p><p>AQENDA OF THE FUNDAMENTALISTS WOULD "EVAPORATE".  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR EXPLAINED WHY IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THE </p><p>EMBARQO ON SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S REQIME.  THE CARDINAL REPLIED </p><p>THAT EVEN IF THE CASE HAS MERIT, THE IMAQES IN WHICH THE </p><p>MUSLIM WORLD SEES ARE THOSE OF "DYING BABIES", DUE TO </p><p>HARD-HEARTED, MEAN AMERICANS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CARDINAL ARINZE SPOKE BRIEFLY ABOUT HIS COUNCIL\'S </p><p>ROLE IN ORGANIZING THE JANUARY 24 INTER-RELIGIOUS </p><p>CONFERENCE IN ASSISI.  HE SAID THAT HE EXPECTED </p><p>APPROXIMATELY 50 U.S. RELIQIOUS LEADERS TO BE INVITED. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR REQUESTED THAT HE SHARE THE INVITATION </p><p>LIST WITH THE EMBASSY AS SOON AS IT IS FINALIZED. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT: THE JANUARY 24 CONFERENCE, ALTHOUGH </p><p>OSTENSIBLY A RELIGIOUS CONFERENCE, HAS THE POTENTIAL OF </p><p>PRODUCING POLITICAL STATEMENTS.  IT IS LIKELY THAT ONE </p><p>SUCH STATEMENT WILL BE A CONDEMNATION OF THE EMBARQO IN </p><p>IRAQ.  POST WILL MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS LEADINQ TO THE </p><p>CONFERENCE, AS WELL AS ATTEND IN AN OBSERVER CAPACITY. </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA06470 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
