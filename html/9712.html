<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 BRASILIA 002364 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR SCRONIN, KLEZNY </p><p>DEPT FOR E:ALARSON; WHA:CSTRUBLE, SPINKHAM; EB:BMANOGUE </p><p>NSC FOR JOANNA WALLACE </p><p>USDA FOR JBPENN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, BR, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) </p><p>SUBJECT: BRAZIL: NO PUBLIC SIGN OF RETREAT FROM FTAA </p><p>PROPOSAL </p><p> </p><p>REF: BRASILIA 2231 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary.  Following the FTAA Trade Negotiating </p><p>Committee meeting in San Salvador July 8-11, during which </p><p>Mercosul unveiled Brazil\'s 3-track proposal for restructuring </p><p>negotiations to unenthusiastic Vice-Ministers, public debate </p><p>in Brazil over the FTAA has been unusually quiet.  Itamaraty </p><p>officials have generally declined comment.  In responding to </p><p>questions after the swearing-in ceremony of Ambassador Luiz </p><p>Macedo Soares as Under Secretary for South America on July </p><p>21, Foreign Minister Amorim stated that the GOB\'s intention </p><p>is to continue pushing the proposal, but signaled a possible </p><p>opening for compromise on the specifics.  Comments by Amorim </p><p>on the same occasion regarding the desirability of more </p><p>commitment to the pursuit of current GOB policies among, at </p><p>least, the top diplomatic echelon of the Ministry, prompted a </p><p>public rebuke by former Foreign Minister Lafer.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND - THE PUBLIC UNVEILING </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) On the eve of the FTAA Trade Negotiating Committee </p><p>(TNC) meeting in San Salvador July 8-11, Foreign Minister </p><p>Amorim wrote an op-ed in which he publicly unveiled Brazil\'s </p><p>Mercosul proposal to transform the FTAA by establishing three </p><p>paths or "tracks" for considering various elements of the </p><p>current negotiation, including moving some elements to the </p><p>WTO (see reftel).  Amorim argued that a new approach was </p><p>needed because within the FTAA, Brazil was "encountering a </p><p>negotiating context that is complex from the standpoint of </p><p>Brazilian interests,"  and that the FTAA project as currently </p><p>envisioned goes far beyond the meaning of "free trade" in its </p><p>strict sense since it includes rules for services, </p><p>investment, government procurement, and intellectual property </p><p>rights, which have a "direct effect on the regulatory powers </p><p>of the countries concerned."  He depicted the proposal as one </p><p>that would create an "FTAA that is possible"  by balancing </p><p>Brazil\'s (offensive) interests with compromises on its </p><p>ability to design and execute policies for social, </p><p>environmental, technological and other types of development. </p><p> </p><p>STANDING FIRM </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Following the less than enthusiastic response the </p><p>proposal received from Vice-Ministers attending the TNC </p><p>meeting, public discussion in Brazil of the FTAA and the </p><p>proposal has been unusually quiet.  One press source claimed </p><p>that he was trying to write an article about the FTAA </p><p>proposal, but was unable to find Itamaraty officials willing </p><p>to be interviewed.  However, answering questions after the </p><p>swearing-in ceremony of Ambassador Luiz Macedo Soares as </p><p>Under Secretary for South America (and FTAA lead negotiator) </p><p>on July 21, Minister Amorim stated that the GOB\'s intention </p><p>is to continue pushing the 3-track proposal.  Amorim said the </p><p>GOB\'s position had not changed "by so much as a dot."  He </p><p>went on to claim that the current format of the negotiations </p><p>among the 34 FTAA countries "does not suit the United States </p><p>just as it does not suit us."   The article reported that </p><p>according to a government source, the U.S. negotiators at the </p><p>TNC meeting had maintained complete silence, which prompted </p><p>Amorim to comment that "silence gives consent." </p><p> </p><p>COMPROMISE ON THE DETAILS? </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Amorim sought to distance himself somewhat from the </p><p>specifics of the proposal by stating that he does not plan to </p><p>involve himself in a debate over "formalities."  According to </p><p>press reports, he said that Brazil might even accept </p><p>"agreements on investments and other systemic topics (in the </p><p>FTAA path) provided they do not go beyond the WTO\'s current </p><p>guidelines."  Amorim also again stated a preference for a </p><p>focus within the FTAA on a market access agreement between </p><p>the United States and Mercosul. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) In late June, the Lula administration came under </p><p>sharp criticism from anti-FTAA forces for supposedly </p><p>providing unwarranted impetus to the negotiations by </p><p>re-committing to their conclusion by January 2005 as part of </p><p>the U.S.-Brazil presidential summit.  Now, Itamaraty is </p><p>facing criticism from the opposite direction.  Press has </p><p>suggested that some ministries fear Itamaraty may have </p><p>imparted a "less palatable" tone to the proposal during the </p><p>TNC meeting, leading to a lack of support.  According to </p><p>press reports, the National Confederation of Industries </p><p>(CNI), which advises the GOB on trade policy through </p><p>coordination of the Brazilian Business Coalition, also has </p><p>noted concern that the current 3-track proposal is </p><p>considerably less ambitious for achieving integration than </p><p>the present FTAA scope.  However, this concern is coupled </p><p>with an acknowledgment by CNI that different economic and </p><p>political circumstances in Brazil warrant some change to the </p><p>FTAA. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Note.  In describing the tit-for-tat approach of </p><p>"moving" elements for negotiation from the FTAA to the WTO, </p><p>Brazilian officials, industry representatives and press </p><p>continue to erroneously characterize USG and GOB motives as </p><p>each taking "sensitive" issues to the WTO.  No </p><p>differentiation is made between the "sensitive" nature of </p><p>investment or intellectual property rights for Brazil, and </p><p>the structural difficulty of negotiating domestic support in </p><p>a regional forum because of domestic agricultural support </p><p>programs being global versus country specific, with two of </p><p>the three major users of such programs (EU and Japan) not </p><p>located within the hemisphere.   End Note. </p><p> </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL LITMUS TEST </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Minister Amorim stirred up a separate debate this </p><p>week when he, as one journalist characterized, "broke with </p><p>the maxim that a diplomat is an official of the State, and </p><p>therefore, will be above the ideological directives of the </p><p>(Presidential) Planalto Palace and everyday political games." </p><p> As part of his official address during Macedo Soares </p><p>swearing-in, Amorim said that in making appointments, two </p><p>things should be considered: professional competence and the </p><p>person\'s "natural affinity with the orientation of the </p><p>Government, the President of the Republic, and the Minister." </p><p> He went on to say that the professional (diplomatic) corps </p><p>ought to be "enthusiastically engaged" with certain political </p><p>lines and "orientations" and claimed that Macedo Soares </p><p>fulfilled these requirements.  His comments drew a swift </p><p>rebuke from former Foreign Minister Lafer in the form of an </p><p>op-ed in which Lafer insisted that a diplomat\'s duty is </p><p>simply to serve Brazil. </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
