<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000161 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/15/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: VISIT TO MUTARE AND MANICALAND </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN FOR REASONS 1.5B/D </p><p> </p><p>1. C) SUMMARY: A BRIEF JANUARY 10-11 VISIT TO MUTARE IN </p><p>MANICALAND PROVINCE CONFIRMED THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM </p><p>THAT ZANU/PF IS FACING DIFFICULTIES IN THE CITY OF </p><p>MUTARE AND SURROUNDING AREAS AND IS VULNERABLE IN ALL </p><p>BUT THE MOST RURAL AREAS. THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH ACTING </p><p>PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATOR MBETSA IN THE ABSENCE OF THE </p><p>GOVERNOR, MAYOR LAWRENCE MUDEHWE, A GROUP OF COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS AND BISHOPS FROM THE CATHOLIC, ANGLICAN, </p><p>EVANGELICAL AND PRESBYTERIAN CHURCHES. HE ALSO VISITED A </p><p>USAID FUNDED VOLUNTARY COUNSELING AND TESTING CENTER AND </p><p>A PRIMARY SCHOOL RECONSTRUCTED FROM DEVASTATING </p><p>HURRICANE ELAINE WITH DOD HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FUNDS. </p><p>THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC DECLINE, PROVOKED BY BAD ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICIES AND LAND INSTABILITY, WAS MUCH IN EVIDENCE. </p><p>POLITICAL VIOLENCE, ORGANIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT, WAS A </p><p>MAJOR CONCERN OF CHURCH LEADERS.  BUT MOST INTERLOCUTORS </p><p>THOUGHT THAT ECONOMIC HARD TIMES AND ZANU-PF INATTENTION </p><p>TO MANICALAND MADE PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S ELECTION PROSPECTS </p><p>IN THE PROVINCE POOR, A PERCEPTION WHICH THE OPPOSITION </p><p>MDC SHARES. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>ECONOMY AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION DOWN </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) MUTARE AND MANICALAND PROVINCE ARE FEELING THE </p><p>IMPACT OF ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, WITH TIMBERLAND, </p><p>AGRO-INDUSTRY AND COMMERCIAL FARMING NEGATIVELY AFFECTED </p><p>BY LAND INSTABILITY AND OCCUPATIONS.  CLOSE PROXIMITY TO </p><p>THE MOZAMBIQUE BORDER HAS ALSO SPAWNED A FLOURISHING </p><p>CLANDESTINE TRADE OF PRICE-CONTROLLED ITEMS FROM </p><p>ZIMBABWE TO MOZAMBIQUE WHERE TRADERS ARE ABLE TO REALIZE </p><p>A HANDSOME PROFIT.  CONSUMERS IN ZIMBABWE FEEL THE </p><p>EFFECT IN SHORTAGES OF THESE BASIC COMMODITIES.  CHURCH </p><p>LEADERS SAID THEIR POOREST CONSTITUENTS ARE FACING REAL </p><p>HUNGER BUT THAT GOVERNMENT DELAYS IN RECOGNIZING </p><p>SHORTAGES MEANT THAT THE CHURCHES DID NOT APPEAL TO </p><p>SUPPORTING INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN A TIMELY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00161  01 OF 02  160830Z </p><p>FASHION.  PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES CLAIMED THAT THE IMPACT </p><p>OF LAND REDISTRIBUTION WAS MINIMAL ON TIMBER, COFFEE AND </p><p>FRUIT AGRO-INDUSTRY, A CLAIM CONTESTED BY PRIVATE </p><p>FARMERS.  ALL AGREED THAT THE EFFECT WAS FELT MOST IN </p><p>SMALL AND MID-SIZED COMMERCIAL FARMS.  AFFECTED </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THEY HAD ALL BEEN </p><p>AFFECTED IN VARIOUS WAYS.  THE FARMER WHO HAD QUICKLY </p><p>SURRENDERED ONE OF HIS TWO FARMS WITHOUT CONTESTATION </p><p>FARED BEST, WHILE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO MADE THE MOST NOISE </p><p>AND WAS CONTESTING IN COURT WAS SUFFERING THE MOST.  BUT </p><p>IN EVERY CASE, PRODUCTIVITY WAS SUFFERING GREATLY WITH </p><p>CROPS OR DAIRY PRODUCTION ON COMMERCIAL FARMS REDUCED </p><p>SUBSTANTIALLY AND FARM OCCUPIERS WITH LITTLE KNOW-HOW </p><p>AND FEW INPUTS, PRODUCING AT MOST A FEW SUBSISTENCE </p><p>CROPS.  IN MANY CASES, THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE A-2 </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARM DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM HAVE BEEN URBAN </p><p>DWELLERS PICKING UP A PIECE OF PROPERTY FOR THE WEEKEND </p><p>WITH LITTLE EXPERIENCE OR PROSPECTS IN SUCCESSFUL </p><p>FARMING.  MUTARE MAYOR MUDEHWE WAS A PLEASANT EXCEPTION </p><p>TO THE TENDENCY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LAND </p><p>DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WHILE THE GETTING WAS GOOD. </p><p>DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS OWN LAND IN THE COMMUNAL AREAS </p><p>HAS INSUFFICIENT WATER FOR PRODUCTIVE FARMING, HE DID </p><p>NOT APPLY FOR A FARM IN THE A-2 PROGRAM TO AVOID THE </p><p>APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE VISIT TO THE DOD-REHABILITATED SCHOOL IN </p><p>ROWA, JUST 20 MINUTES OUTSIDE MUTARE IN A COMMUNAL AREA, </p><p>WAS INSTRUCTIVE.  THE SCHOOLED WAS BASIC BUT </p><p>SERVICEABLE. THE PRIMARY SCHOOL STUDENTS, PRESENT DURING </p><p>THE SCHOOL HOLIDAYS PERFORMING THEIR MANDATORY GROUNDS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00161  01 OF 02  160830Z </p><p>MAINTENANCE CHORES, WERE DRESSED POORLY BUT ADEQUATELY </p><p>AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF HUNGER OR MALNUTRITION.  THE </p><p>REHABILITATION PROJECT WAS WELL EXECUTED AND A REAL </p><p>CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMUNITY, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE </p><p>PARTICIPATION OF OFFICIALS FROM THE SCHOOL, THE </p><p>PROVINCE, THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND THE PARENTS\' </p><p>ASSOCIATION IN THE BRIEF CEREMONY. </p><p> </p><p>VIOLENCE AND POLITICS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) IN TWO SEPARATE MEETINGS, THE CATHOLIC AND </p><p>PROTESTANT CLERGYMEN COMPLAINED OF FREQUENT POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE ORCHESTRATED BY ZANU/PF AND THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>THE PROTESTANT CLERGY COMPLAINED THAT THE STATE MEDIA </p><p>HAD DISTORTED THEIR RECENT MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>TO CLAIM THAT IT FOCUSED ON THEIR SUPPORT FOR GOVERNMENT </p><p>LAND REFORM.  THEY HAD PUT OUT SUBSEQUENT STATEMENTS </p><p>CLARIFYING THAT THEIR FOCUS HAD BEEN AN APPEAL FOR NON- </p><p>VIOLENCE.  THEY SAID THAT ALL RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN THE </p><p>PROVINCE WERE UNITED IN THIS APPEAL.  THEY DID NOT </p><p>BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT VIOLENCE WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN </p><p>MANICALAND, EXCEPT IN THE MOST RURAL PARTS OF THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ6260 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00161  02 OF 02  160830Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AF-00    AID-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00 </p><p>      AC-01    NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   PA-00    PM-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00 </p><p>      T-00     USIE-00  PMB-00   PRM-00   G-00     SAS-00     /007W </p><p>                  ------------------5867DB  160830Z /40 </p><p>P 160752Z JAN 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 0729 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK PRIORITY </p><p>HQ USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GE//ECJ4-HA// </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 000161 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/15/2007 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, EAID, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: VISIT TO MUTARE AND MANICALAND </p><p> </p><p>PROVINCE, WHERE THE OPPOSITION WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY </p><p>GETTING ITS MESSAGE OUT.  THEY PLANNED TO ORGANIZE MORE </p><p>PRESSURE AGAINST VIOLENCE IN THE WEEKS AHEAD.  CATHOLIC </p><p>BISHOP MUTUME ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN AT POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE IN THE PROVINCE AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>UNWILLINGNESS TO CURB IT.  HE DID NOT THINK THAT THIS </p><p>VIOLENCE WOULD BENEFIT THE RULING PARTY, HOWEVER, AS </p><p>PEOPLE KNEW WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VIOLENCE AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00161  02 OF 02  160830Z </p><p>ECONOMIC HARD TIMES.  AS THE AMBASSADOR ARRIVED IN </p><p>MUTARE, HE ENCOUNTERED A GROUP OF 100 GREEN-UNIFORMED </p><p>YOUTH BRIGADE GRADUATES BEING SWORN IN AND WELCOMED BACK </p><p>TO MUTARE TO CARRY OUT THEIR SERVICE.  ASKED WHAT WORK </p><p>THEY WOULD BE DOING IN MUTARE, THE ACTING PROVINCIAL </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR SAID THEY WOULD BE CARRYING OUT CIVIC </p><p>PROJECTS. (COMMENT: WOULD THAT IT WERE SO.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) LAWRENCE MUDEHWE, WHO HAS BEEN ELECTED MAYOR OF </p><p>MUTARE TWICE, NOTWITHSTANDING THE OPPOSITION OF HIS OWN </p><p>ZANU-PF PARTY, WAS FRANK ABOUT ZANU_PF WEAKNESS IN </p><p>MANICALAND.  HE NOTED THE POOR REPRESENTATION OF </p><p>MANICALAND IN THE ZANU-PF LEADERSHIP AND THE TENDENCY OF </p><p>HARARE PARTY HEADQUARTERS TO SEEK TO IMPOSE ITS </p><p>DECISIONS ON LOCAL PARTY STRUCTURES.  HE BELIEVED THAT </p><p>POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE ECONOMIC </p><p>POLICIES WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT AT THE POLLS AND </p><p>THAT ZANU-PF WOULD NOT DO WELL IN MANICALAND PROVINCE. </p><p> </p><p>HIV-AIDS: A GROWING COMMUNITY FOCUS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) IN MEETINGS WITH CHURCH BISHOPS, HIV-AIDS WAS A </p><p>MAJOR CONCERN.  THE CATHOLIC BISHOP, WHO HAS HAD </p><p>SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT IN HIS OUTREACH PROGRAMS FROM THE </p><p>CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICE, SAID THAT HE NO LONGER NEEDED </p><p>TO PLEA FOR SUPPORT FROM COMMUNITY LEADERS.  EVERYONE </p><p>HAS BEEN TOUCHED BY THE DISEASE, EVEN IN THE MOST RURAL </p><p>PARTS OF HIS DIOCESE.  VILLAGE CHIEFS WERE ANXIOUS TO </p><p>HELP AND TO HAVE THE CHURCH\'S ASSISTANCE IN CONFRONTING </p><p>THE PROBLEM. BISHOP MUTUME SAID THAT THE CHURCH HAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00161  02 OF 02  160830Z </p><p>SOUGHT TO ASSIST IN THE FAMILY CARE OF THOSE AFFECTED, </p><p>BUT THEN TO HELP TRANSPORT THE ILL TO THEIR RURAL </p><p>VILLAGES BEFORE DEATH IN ORDER TO SPARE THE FAMILY </p><p>EXPENSIVE FUNERAL COSTS.  BISHOP MUTUME AND THE OTHER </p><p>BISHOPS WERE ALL FOCUSED ON BEHAVIOR CHANGE AS A KEY TO </p><p>ATTACKING HIV-AIDS.  THEY WERE PLEASED TO LEARN MORE </p><p>ABOUT THE NEW START VOLUNTARY COUNSELING AND TESTING </p><p>CENTER WHICH IS FUNCTIONING IN MUTARE IN CONJUNCTION </p><p>WITH THE MUTARE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE RED CROSS. THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR VISITED THE MUTARE NEW START CENTER, WHICH </p><p>HAS SEEN IMPRESSIVE GROWTH IN ITS USAGE, PARTICULARLY </p><p>SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF QUICK TESTING KITS. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
