THE CITIZENS WERE UNPREPARED FOR THE </p><p>SERBIAN OCCUPATION BECAUSE YUGO ARMY REPRESENTATIVES </p><p>HAD PROMISED OVER THE RADIO SECURITY AND PEACE JUST </p><p>THREE DAYS BEFORE THE OCCUPATION.

THESE GROUPS OF LUNATICS AND </p><p>PSYCHOPATHS GO FROM APARTMENT TO APARTMENT, CELLAR TO </p><p>CELLAR, AND, HIDDEN BEHIND THICK WALLS, COMMIT CRIMES </p><p>AGAINST THE POWERLESS CIVILIANS.  UNDER THESE </p><p>CIRCUMSTANCES, GOING TO THE YUGO ARMY BARRACKS SEEMED </p><p>LIKE A BETTER CHANCE TO LEAVE THIS TOWN IN WHICH ONE </p><p>COULD ALREADY SMELL DEATH. </p><p> </p><p>UPON OUR ARRIVAL AT THE BARRACKS, WE REALIZED WE WERE </p><p>ALL IN A TRAP BECAUSE THERE, TOGETHER WITH THE </p><p>REGULAR ARMY, WERE CHETNIKS AND OTHER SERBIAN REFUSE. </p><p>THEY OFFERED TO GIVE US RIFLES IF WE WOULD FIGHT </p><p>AGAINST OUR OWN PEOPLE FOR THE SERBIAN CAUSE.  THE </p><p>MUSLIMS AND CROATS SILENTLY REFUSED.  OUR WIVES AND </p><p>CHILDREN WERE PUT ON A BUS AND WERE TAKEN TO AN </p><p>UNKNOWN DESTINATION. </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                   LIMITED OFFICIAL USE </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02532  02 OF 04  301526Z </p><p>AT GUNPOINT, WE MEN WERE ALSO PUT ON A BUS.

FOR THE </p><p>COUPLE HUNDRED OF US WHO WERE LOCKED UP, THE LONG </p><p>HOURS OF TORTURE BEGAN.  DURING THIS TIME, VARIOUS </p><p>PEOPLE IN UNIFORM LOOKED US OVER, EXPECTING TO FIND </p><p>CERTAIN IMPORTANT PEOPLE AMONG US.  ALONG WITH THE </p><p>USUAL WEAPONS IN THEIR BELTS, THESE UNIFORMED PEOPLE </p><p>ALSO CARRIED BIG KITCHEN KNIVES.  WE KNEW THEIR </p><p>PURPOSE AND EXPECTED THE WORST. </p><p> </p><p>THE TORTURE STARTED WITH ORAL THREATS.  THE SERBS </p><p>WOULD SING SONGS DEDICATED TO DRAZA MIHAJLOVIC, THE </p><p>CHETNIK LEADER IN WORLD WAR TWO.  SOME OF US, </p><p>THREATENED BY EXECUTION, HAD TO LEARN THE SONGS BY </p><p>HEART.  THE SERBS ENJOYED OUR FEAR AND MADE FUN OF </p><p>US.  THEN THEIR BEARDED LEADER STARTED TO RECITE THE </p><p>ORTHODOX LORD\'S PRAYER.  WE HAD TO LISTEN TO IT WHILE </p><p>STANDING AND THEN END HIS CLOSING WORDS WITH AMIN </p><p>(THE ORTHODOX AMEN). </p><p> </p><p>NEXT THE SERBS STARTED SLAPPING US, HITTING US WITH </p><p>BOXES AND FEET.  WHEN THIS ENDED, THEY TOOK FOUR OF </p><p>US OUT FOR EXECUTION.  WE WERE SELECTED BY RANKO </p><p>CESIC, KNOWN PREVIOUSLY AS A CRIMINAL AND A VIOLENT </p><p>PERSON.  I TRIED TALKING TO THE SERBS, EXPLAINING </p><p>THAT I HAD COME TO THE BARRACKS WITH MY WIFE AND </p><p>CHILDREN AFTER HEARING THE APPEAL OVER THE RADIO, BUT </p><p>THEY DID NOT CARE.

I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER </p><p>SEE EITHER MY CHILDREN OR MY FAMILY AGAIN AND THAT </p><p>ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME WAS DEFINITELY NOT A </p><p>DREAM BUT A HORRID REALITY.  MY EYES CLOSED, I LOST </p><p>CONSCIOUSNESS, AND MY BODY CRUMBLED ONTO PIECES OF </p><p>GLASS.  MY FAINTING AWAKENED A BIT OF HUMANITY IN THE </p><p>SERBS\' LEADER.  HE ORDERED THEM TO BRING ME BACK TO </p><p>THE HALL, WHERE I COULD REST A LITTLE.  ONE OF THE </p><p>SERBS TOOK SATISFACTION IN REMOVING MY GLASSES AND </p><p>BREAKING THEM. </p><p> </p><p>THE OTHER THREE MEN WERE KILLED IN THE MOST CRUEL </p><p>MANNER.

THEN THE THREE </p><p>MEN WERE HELD BY THEIR LEGS AND BEATEN WHILE AGAINST </p><p>THE WALL OF THE BUILDING WHERE WE WERE IMPRISONED. </p><p>WITH ABOUT TWENTY MORE SHOTS, THE SERBS ASSURED THE </p><p>THREE MEN\'S DEATH. </p><p> </p><p>THE NEXT AFTERNOON, FOUR OF US MANAGED TO GET SOME </p><p>SYMPATHY FROM ONE OF THE SERBIAN POLICEMEN.  HE LET </p><p>US GET ON A BUS GOING TO BIJELJINA, ON WHICH THERE </p><p>WAS A GROUP OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.  FROM THERE I </p><p>LUCKILY MANAGED TO ESCAPE, EVEN FROM BIJELJINA, WHERE </p><p>THE SERBIAN AUTHORITIES STILL TAKE PEOPLE FROM THEIR </p><p>HOMES, USUALLY DURING THE NIGHT, WHO NEVER RETURN.  I </p><p>MANAGED TO GET TO THE FREE PART OF CROATIA THROUGH </p><p>HUNGARY AND SLOVENIA. </p><p> </p><p>ALL THAT I HAVE WRITTEN HERE CAN BE CONFIRMED BY </p><p>THREE OTHER WITNESSES WHO ALSO MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM </p><p>THAT HELL.  I THINK WE WERE LUCKY THAT WE WENT </p><p>THROUGH ALL THIS IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THE SERBIAN </p><p>OCCUPATION, WHILE THE SERBIAN KILLING MACHINERY WAS </p><p>NOT SO WELL DEVELOPED YET.  I DO NOT KNOW THE DESTINY </p><p>OF THE OTHERS WHO REMAINED THERE.  A FEW GYPSIES </p><p>ACCEPTED THE SERBIAN OFFER TO JOIN THEIR ARMED FORCES </p><p>AND THUS SAVED THEIR NECKS FROM THE CHETNIKS... </p><p> </p><p>I AM NOT SUCH A GREAT WITNESS SINCE I WITNESSED ONLY </p><p>FOUR KILLINGS, OF WHICH THREE INDIVIDUALS I KNEW </p><p>PERSONALLY.
