<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 001740 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR WHA/CEN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KCRM, KJUS, SNAR, PINR, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW HONDURAN LEGISLATION SEEKS TO CURB ARMS </p><p>TRAFFICKING AND VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SUMMARY:  On July 2, the Honduran National Congress </p><p>added Article 332 to the Honduran Penal Code.  This article </p><p>calls for the collection of assault weapons and stricter </p><p>punishment for trafficking and possession of outlawed </p><p>weapons.  Article 332 comes at a time when Ministry of Public </p><p>Security reports show that possession of assault weapons and </p><p>their use in violent crime has been increasing steadily over </p><p>the past several years in Honduras. END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>Origins and Trends </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On July 2, the Honduran National Congress added </p><p>Article 332 to the Honduran Penal Code.  This article calls </p><p>for the collection of assault weapons and stricter punishment </p><p>for trafficking and possession of outlawed weapons.  As </p><p>reported by the Honduran press, approximately 82 percent of </p><p>all deaths in Honduras are caused by firearms (of which 90 </p><p>percent are from AK-47s).  Even more alarming are reports </p><p>that 80 percent of these victims are minors. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The availability of AK-47s and other automatic assault </p><p>weapons in Honduras stems largely from the Contra period of </p><p>the 1980s.  While estimates vary, it is believed that between </p><p>400,000 and 500,000 arms illegally circulate in Honduras, of </p><p>which 200,000 are AK-47s.  In addition to the lack of </p><p>effective laws and regulations surrounding the trafficking </p><p>and possession of arms, it is very easy and inexpensive to </p><p>acquire them.  Press reports state that an AK-47 can be </p><p>purchased at the El Salvadoran and Nicaraguan borders for as </p><p>little as USD 20.  Furthermore, a recent trend has shown an </p><p>increase in drugs-for-arms exchanges occurring among </p><p>traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Article 332 </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) The newly passed Article 332 of the Honduran Penal </p><p>Code makes the possession of the following arms illegal: </p><p>AK-47s, Falks (FAL and FAP), UZI sub-military machine guns, </p><p>M16s, M60s, Galils, G3s, Beretas, M21s, and any other </p><p>fabricated arms.  The collection and destruction of these </p><p>items is slated to begin with a 90 day arms-for-money </p><p>exchange program.  Those persons turning over weapons will </p><p>receive approximately USD 68 per item and will not face any </p><p>criminal charges.  Another aspect of Article 332 calls for </p><p>harsher punishment for those possessing and/or trafficking </p><p>illegal weapons.  Such actions will carry a six-to-nine year </p><p>prison sentence and possible fines of between USD 580 and USD </p><p>1,162.  (COMMENT: It is hoped that this new legislation will </p><p>give a boost to earlier attempts by the National Arms </p><p>Registry (RNA) to register personal small firearms.  Under </p><p>current law, each Honduran citizen is allowed up to five </p><p>weapons, a large amount for a country facing such high rates </p><p>of violence. END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) President of Congress, Pepe Lobo, has called for all </p><p>members of Congress to set an example by turning over their </p><p>own personal weapons.  (COMMENT:  Currently, many political </p><p>figures and prominent businessman hire private security </p><p>personnel, the majority of which use AK-47s.  It is likely </p><p>that certain private security companies and individuals will </p><p>be given waivers from the new law.  END COMMENT) </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>A Step In the Right Direction </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) COMMENT: Congressional passage of Article 332 is a </p><p>positive step towards reducing the trafficking and possession </p><p>of automatic assault weapons such as the AK 47.  It remains </p><p>to be seen, however, whether the government of Honduras has </p><p>the political fortitude, and makes available the necessary </p><p>resources, to fully enforce this new legislation.  According </p><p>to government statistics, the number of homicides increased </p><p>in 2002 despite the military\'s augmentation of the police </p><p>force, and the homicide closure rate in Honduras remains at </p><p>only one to two percent.  Moreover, in recent months the </p><p>local media has given extensive coverage to stories involving </p><p>assault weapon related violence.  Violent crime is a high </p><p>profile public issue.  If this legislation proves effective </p><p>in reducing homicides and arms trafficking, President </p><p>Maduro\'s Administration will have won a significant </p><p>legislative success at a time when public confidence in the </p><p>Administration\'s ability to deliver on campaign promises of </p><p>increased public security is faltering.  END COMMENT </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
