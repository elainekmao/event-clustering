<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 PRETORIA 20502 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR MCKINLEY; PARIS FOR FENDRICK </p><p>NSC FOR ROBERT FRASURE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SF </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE SAG-ANC RELATIONSHIP: A YEAR END PERSPECTIVE </p><p> </p><p>1. C - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  A NEW MOOD OF UNCERTAINTY HAS SETTLED OVER SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA FOLLOWING A YEAR OF UNPRECEDENTED POLITICAL </p><p>CHANGE.  AFTER A PROMISING START, NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ANC HAVE BOGGED DOWN.  DISTRUST </p><p>HAS DEEPENED, FUELED BY ANC SUSPICIONS THAT THE SAG IS </p><p>TRYING TO PROFIT FROM ESCALATING TOWNSHIP VIOLENCE. </p><p>FOR ITS PART, THE SAG BLAMES THE LACK OF MOVEMENT </p><p>TOWARDS CONSTITUTIONAL NEGOTIATIONS ON THE ANC\'S LACK </p><p>OF ORGANIZATION AND ON DIVISIONS INSIDE THE MOVEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  THESE PROBLEMS ARE MANAGEABLE PROVIDED THE TWO </p><p>SIDES DEVELOP A RENEWED SENSE OF URGENCY AND COMMON </p><p>PURPOSE EARLY IN THE NEW YEAR.  THAT IMPERATIVE IS </p><p>UNDERSTOOD AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE ANC AND THE </p><p>SAG, WE BELIEVE.  AT LOWER LEVELS THE PERSPECTIVE IS </p><p>LESS CLEAR.  MANY ANC MILITANTS BELIEVE THEY HAVE </p><p>CONCEDED A GREAT DEAL, ESPECIALLY IN AGREEING TO </p><p>SUSPEND THE ARMED STRUGGLE, AND OBTAINED LITTLE FROM </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN THE TALKS THUS FAR:  E.G., THE PRISONERS </p><p>ARE STILL NOT FREE, THE EXILES NOT YET HOME, AND </p><p>UNPRECEDENTED LARGESCALE VIOLENCE IS CONTINUING. </p><p>THE "COMRADES" ARE DEMANDING A MORE AGGRESSIVE ANC </p><p>STANCE IN THE YEAR AHEAD.  IN THE SAG THERE ARE </p><p>ELEMENTS EAGER TO EXPLOIT SUPPOSED SCHISMS IN THE </p><p>ANC-SACP-COSATU ALLIANCE.  OTHERS APPEAR READY TO CAST </p><p>ABOUT FOR DIFFERENT BLACK INTERLOCUTORS AND NEGOTIATE </p><p>A NEW CONSTITUTION WITH THEM REGARDLESS OF THE ANC. </p><p> </p><p>4.  BOTH SIDES CAN TAKE SOME SMALL COMFORT PERHAPS IN </p><p>THAT EXTREMIST CHALLENGES FAILED TO MATERIALIZE IN </p><p>1990.  TO THE RIGHT, THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS LOSING </p><p>GROUND.  THE PAN AFRICANIST CONGRESS (PAC) DOES NOT </p><p>APPEAR TO BE PULLING MILITANTS AWAY FROM THE ANC AS </p><p>MANY PREDICTED IT WOULD.  WHILE THERE IS PROMISE FOR </p><p>PROGRESS IN 1991, THE YEAR IS ENDING ON A LESS </p><p>OPTIMISTIC NOTE THAN THE EVENTS OF FEBRUARY 1990 MIGHT </p><p>HAVE LED ONE TO EXPECT.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>DE KLERK\'S THREE-PRONGED OFFENSIVE </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THREE DISTINCT PROCESSES WERE EITHER INITIATED OR </p><p>INTENSIFIED BY DE KLERK IN 1990: </p><p> </p><p>-- POLITICAL LIBERALIZATION.  THE UNBANNING OF THE ANC </p><p>AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF </p><p>EMERGENCY, THE REMOVAL OF RESTRICTIONS ON POLITICAL </p><p>ACTIVITY, AND THE RELEASE OF NELSON MANDELA AND MANY </p><p>POLITICAL DETAINEES COMPLETELY CHANGED THE NATURE OF </p><p>SOUTH AFRICAN POLITICS.  DE KLERK HAS, IN EFFECT, </p><p>GIVEN THE ANC, THE SACP, THE PAC AND OTHERS </p><p>UNPRECEDENTED ROOM TO MANUEVER -- AND TO COMMIT </p><p>MISTAKES -- WHILE REAPING INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION </p><p>FOR HIS BOLD REFORMISM.  CONTROL OF THE LIBERALIZATION </p><p>AGENDA, AND THE CONTENT AND TIMING OF REFORMS, HAS </p><p>REMAINED ENTIRELY IN GOVERNMENT\'S HANDS. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE SCRAPPING OF APARTHEID.  HERE TOO DE KLERK HAS </p><p>DICTATED THE PACE OF REFORM.  IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT </p><p>BY MID-1991 ALL THE MAIN PILLARS OF APARTHEID, </p><p>POSSIBLY EVEN THE POPULATION REGISTRATION ACT, WILL </p><p>HAVE BEEN LEGISLATED OUT OF EXISTENCE.  WHITES HAVE </p><p>ADJUSTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED (SO FAR, AT LEAST) TO </p><p>THE REMOVAL OF RACIAL BARRIERS, ALTHOUGH 1991 IS </p><p>LIKELY TO SEE EFFORTS TOWARD LOCAL AND INFORMAL FORMS </p><p>OF DISCRIMINATION. </p><p> </p><p>-- NEGOTIATIONS FOR A NEW CONSTITUTION.  AT THE </p><p>PRETORIA SUMMIT AUGUST 6, THE SAG AND ANC DELEGATIONS </p><p>DECLARED THAT THE WAY WAS OPEN FOR THE START OF </p><p>SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS.  ALMOST IMMEDIATELY </p><p>THEREAFTER, THE SAG-ANC DIALOGUE BOGGED DOWN, AND FOR </p><p>THE PAST FOUR MONTHS THE SAG HAS VACILLATED BETWEEN </p><p>DIALOGUE WITH THE ANC AND MEASURES TO WEAKEN THE ANC. </p><p>DE KLERK CAN PRESS FORWARD ON REFORM AND LIBERALIZE </p><p>UNILATERALLY IN 1991, BUT HE WILL AT SOME POINT COME </p><p>UNDER PRESSURE TO BEGIN SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS, </p><p>EVEN WITHOUT ANC PARTICIPATION (WHICH IN OUR VIEW </p><p>WOULD BE A GRAVE ERROR).  THE ANC WILL CLAIM </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS CANNOT BEGIN UNTIL PRE-CONDITIONS AND </p><p>"STUMBLING BLOCKS" HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND, IN THIS </p><p>RESPECT, HAS GIVEN THE SAG UNTIL APRIL 30 TO REMOVE </p><p>THEM.  IF THEY ARE NOT REMOVED, THE ANC HAS SAID IT </p><p>WILL RECONSIDER ITS COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATIONS AND THE </p><p>SUSPENSION OF THE ARMED STRUGGLE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS BOGGED DOWN </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  IT IS THE STALLED NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS WHICH MOST </p><p>WORRIES OBSERVERS.  BEHIND IT LIES AN EROSION OF TRUST </p><p>BETWEEN SAG AND ANC NEGOTIATORS AND, TO A LESSER </p><p>EXTENT PERHAPS, BETWEEN MANDELA AND DE KLERK </p><p>PERSONALLY.  THIS EROSION BEGAN IN AUGUST AND IS </p><p>CONTINUING.  IT IS LINKED TO THE TOWNSHIP VIOLENCE, </p><p>WHICH MOST ANC LEADERS FIRMLY BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>IS EXPLOITING FOR ITS OWN POLITICAL ENDS.  MANDELA NOW </p><p>CLAIMS THERE IS A SAG "DOUBLE AGENDA" -- NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>TO PLACATE PUBLIC OPINION COUPLED WITH A CONSPIRACY TO </p><p>DIVIDE AND WEAKEN THE ANC.  FROM A SAG PERSPECTIVE, </p><p>THE PROBLEM IS THE ANC\'S DISORGANIZATION, ITS </p><p>INABILITY TO CONTROL ITS FOLLOWERS AND, ULTIMATELY, </p><p>ITS RELUCTANCE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND STICK WITH THEM. </p><p>RESTORING A MEASURE OF COMMON PURPOSE AND INSTILLING A </p><p>NEW SENSE OF URGENCY WILL BE ESSENTIAL IN THE EARLY </p><p>MONTHS OF 1991 IF THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS IS TO BE </p><p>KEPT ON TRACK. </p><p> </p><p>7.  MODERATES ON BOTH SIDES REALIZE THAT THERE IS NO </p><p>LONG-RUN ALTERNATIVE TO NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT </p><p>POWER-SHARING.  THERE IS NO "RETURN TO THE LAAGER" </p><p>OPTION FOR WHITE SOUTH AFRICA.  THERE IS NO REAL ARMED </p><p>STRUGGLE OPTION FOR THE ANC.  IN THAT SENSE, POLITICAL </p><p>CHANGE IN SOUTH AFRICA IS TRULY IRREVERSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  WHAT HAS BECOME LESS CLEAR IN THE FINAL MONTHS OF </p><p>1990 IS WHETHER THE SOUTH AFRICA\'S TWO MAIN PLAYERS </p><p>WILL RE-ENGAGE PROMPTLY IN EARLY 1991 OR WHETHER THE </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON HOLD.  FOR </p><p>THE ANC, RIDDLED WITH ORGANIZATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND </p><p>CONSTITUENT PROBLEMS, THERE WILL BE A STRONG EFFORT TO </p><p>REFOCUS ITS RESOURCES ON REBUILDING ITS NEGLECTED TIES </p><p>TO GRASSROOTS SUPPORTERS AND PROMOTING BLACK UNITY, </p><p>ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE WEEKEND\'S CONSULTATIVE </p><p>CONFERENCE.  "MASS ACTION" PROTEST WILL FIGURE </p><p>PROMINENTLY IN SUCH A STRATEGY.  MANY IN THE ANC, AND </p><p>MORE ESPECIALLY IN THE SACP, APPEAR TO BELIEVE THAT </p><p>SUCH MUSCLE-FLEXING IS ESSENTIAL IF THE ANC IS TO HAVE </p><p>ANY CLOUT AT ALL AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  THE SAG, </p><p>FOR ITS PART, WILL DEMAND THAT THE ANC DISTANCE ITSELF </p><p>FROM BOYCOTTS, STRIKES AND STAYAWAYS WHICH HAVE </p><p>VIOLENT POTENTIAL.  IF A SPIRIT OF COOPERATION CAN BE </p><p>ENGENDERED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANC ACTION COULD BE </p><p>CHANNELED THOUGHTFULLY INTO PEACEFUL MASS </p><p>DEMONSTRATIONS, ALLOWING THE ANC TO FLEX ITS MUSCLE </p><p>AND PLACE PRESSURE ON THE SAG, WITHOUT UNDERMINING THE </p><p>PROCESS.  BUT THIS WOULD REQUIRE ENORMOUS RESTRAINT ON </p><p>BOTH SIDES. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>NO REAL CHALLENGE TO THE NATS AND THE ANC </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  DESPITE THESE UNCERTAINTIES, BOTH THE ANC AND SAG </p><p>HAVE AT LEAST ONE IMPORTANT SUCCESS TO CELEBRATE AS </p><p>THE YEAR DRAWS TO A CLOSE.  POLITICAL THREATS FROM </p><p>BOTH THE FAR RIGHT AND FROM THE FAR LEFT PROVED MUCH </p><p>LESS FORMIDABLE THAN ORIGINALLY FEARED.  THIS VICTORY, </p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, IS PARTLY OFFSET BY UNPRECEDENTED </p><p>VIOLENCE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  A SERIOUS CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHALLENGE TO DE </p><p>KLERK HAS YET TO MATERIALIZE.  CP LEADERS HAVE FAILED </p><p>TO COME UP WITH PRACTICAL ALTERNATIVES TO DE KLERK\'S </p><p>REFORMS.  OCTOBER POLLS SHOW THE CP SLIPPING BACK TO </p><p>ONLY 25 PERCENT OF THE WHITE VOTE WHILE THE NATIONAL </p><p>PARTY SUPPORT ROSE TO SLIGHTLY OVER 50 PERCENT.  IN A </p><p>PINCH, DE KLERK COULD PROBABLY COUNT ON THE BACKING OF </p><p>ALMOST ALL THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY VOTES.  HIS </p><p>POSITION VIS-A-VIS THE WHITE ELECTORATE, AND WITHIN </p><p>THE NATIONAL PARTY, IS STRONGER THAN EVER. </p><p> </p><p>11.  SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT CLAIMS </p><p>THAT THE ANC IS LOSING SUPPORT TO MORE MILITANT BLACK </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS ON THE LEFT SUCH AS THE PAC.  WHILE THE </p><p>ANC HAS DOUBTLESS LOST SOME SUPPORT (RECENT </p><p>INDEPENDENT AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED POLLS BOTH </p><p>INDICATE THAT BLACK SUPPORT FOR THE ANC HAS SOFTENED </p><p>CONSIDERABLY), THESE APPEAR TO BE LOSSES TO APATHY OR </p><p>INDIFFERENCE, NOT DEFECTIONS TO THE PAC.  DESPITE </p><p>THESE SETBACKS, THE ANC\'S PRE-EMINENCE AMONG </p><p>OPPOSITION GROUPS REMAINS UNQUESTIONED.  MOREOVER, ANC </p><p>LOSSES CAN BE MADE UP QUICKLY.  OPTIMAL FROM MANDELA\'S </p><p>POINT OF VIEW WOULD BE A STRATEGY WHICH TRANSFORMS </p><p>PEACEFUL MASS ACTION INTO INCREASED LEVERAGE AT THE </p><p>NEGOTIATING TABLE. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>SAG SCORES IN WORLD CAPITALS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  IN ONE CRITICAL AREA IN 1990, SAG GAINS WERE ANC </p><p>LOSSES.  FOR MANY YEARS THE DIPLOMATIC QUARANTINE OF </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA BY MOST OF THE THE THIRD WORLD AND </p><p>COMMUNIST BLOC WAS A KEY INGREDIENT IN </p><p>ANC-ORCHESTRATED PRESSURE ON PRETORIA.  IN 1990 THE </p><p>QUARANTINE CRUMBLED.  THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN </p><p>AFFAIRS CLAIMS IT IS UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE MANY </p><p>CONTACT OPPORTUNITIES ON OFFER.  THE LOSS OF ITS VETO </p><p>OVER MANY FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL CONTACT WITH PRETORIA </p><p>IS A BLOW TO THE ANC.  THE LIFTING OF AT LEAST SOME </p><p>SANCTIONS BY WESTERN DEMOCRACIES IS AN INEVITABLE NEXT </p><p>STEP IN 1991, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE WEEKEND\'S EC </p><p>DECISION TO LIFT THE BAN ON INVESTMENT IN SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA.  THE ANC HAS NOT MOVED DECISIVELY TO SET NEW </p><p>TERMS UNDER WHICH IT WOULD APPROVE A LIFTING OF </p><p>SANCTIONS, AN OMISSION WHICH FURTHER REDUCES ITS </p><p>LEVERAGE WITH THE SAG.  (OLIVER TAMBO WAS OBVIOUSLY </p><p>AWARE OF THIS WHEN HE ASKED THE ANC CONSULTATIVE </p><p>CONFERENCE TO REVIEW THE ENTIRE SANCTIONS ISSUE, BUT </p><p>THE MILITANT ASSEMBLY, WEARLY OF TOWNSHIP VIOLENCE AND </p><p>DISTRUSTFUL OF THE SAG, REJECTED ANY SUGGESTION OF </p><p>LIFTING SANCTIONS.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>13.  NO ONE EXPECTED THE SAG AND ANC TO BE ON A QUICK </p><p>AND STRAIGHT COURSE TOWARDS POWER-SHARING NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>BY THE END OF 1990.  THE LOSS OF BOTH MOMENTUM AND A </p><p>CLEAR SENSE OF DIRECTION IS NEVERTHELESS A </p><p>DISAPPOINTMENT.  IF THIS DEADLOCK PERSISTS BEYOND </p><p>MID-1991, THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT THAT THIS UNEASY </p><p>PARTNERSHIP WILL TURN OPENLY CONFRONTATIONAL.  THE </p><p>MAIN REASON FOR OPTIMISM IS THAT NEITHER THE SAG NOR </p><p>THE ANC HAS ANY PLAUSIBLE LONG-TERM OPTION OTHER THAN </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS.  WE STILL BELIEVE THEY WILL SEIZE THIS </p><p>OPTION, BUT THE WAY AHEAD WILL BE ROUGH.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWING. </p><p></p></div>
