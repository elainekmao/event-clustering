<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 PRETORIA 006905 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR YOUNG; PARIS FOR MORAN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS:     KWMN, PHUM, SADC, SF </p><p>SUBJECT:  STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE SADC REGION:  SOUTH </p><p>          AFRICA </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) STATE 112270         B) STATE 36753 </p><p>      C) CAPE TOWN 00363      D) STATE 39368 </p><p> </p><p>1.  ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS CABLES HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED SOME </p><p>OF THESE ISSUES, FOLLOWING ARE GENERAL RESPONSES TO </p><p>QUESTIONS POSED REF A.  SEPTELS ON SPECIFIC ISSUES (LAND, </p><p>HOUSING, TRADITIONAL/CUSTOMARY LAW) AS WELL AS SEPTEL </p><p>ADDRESSING POST\'S ACTIONS TO PROMOTE GENDER EQUALITY WILL </p><p>FOLLOW. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY: SINCE THE 1994 ELECTIONS, THE SAG HAS BEEN </p><p>QUITE COMMITTED TO THE RECOGNITION AND AMELIORATION OF </p><p>THE PLIGHT OF SOUTH AFRICAN WOMEN.  IT HAS RECENTLY </p><p>SUCCEEDED IN CARRYING OUT SEVERAL OF ITS SPECIFIC POST- </p><p>BEIJING PLANS (SEE REF. B) INCLUDING RATIFICATION OF THE </p><p>UN CEDAW IN JANUARY 1996, PROVISION OF FREE HEALTH CARE </p><p>FOR PREGNANT WOMEN, AND THE PASSAGE OF THE COMMISSION ON </p><p>GENDER EQUALITY ACT 39 OF 1996.  NEVERTHELESS, IN MANY </p><p>AREAS, THE SAG, THOUGH PUBLICLY COMMITTED TO REFORM, IS </p><p>SLOW TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS/LAW </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>3.  THE NEW CONSTITUTION, ADOPTED IN MAY OF THIS YEAR, </p><p>GUARANTEES EQUALITY, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, FREEDOM AND </p><p>SECURITY OF PERSON, AND HOUSING, HEALTH CARE, FOOD, WATER </p><p>AND SOCIAL SECURITY.  EQUALITY CLAUSE 9.3 IN THE BILL OF </p><p>RIGHTS IS QUITE EXTENSIVE, PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION ON </p><p>THE GROUNDS OF GENDER, SEX, PREGNANCY, MARITAL STATUS, </p><p>AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  INEVITABLY </p><p>HOWEVER, DISCREPANCIES STILL EXIST BETWEEN LAW AND </p><p>PRACTICE.  ALTHOUGH CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OVERRIDES ANY </p><p>POTENTIALLY DISCRIMINATORY CUSTOMARY LAWS, IT IS </p><p>QUESTIONABLE HOW COGNIZANT WOMEN IN TRADITIONAL SOCIETIES </p><p>ARE OF THEIR RIGHTS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>DOCUMENTS WHICH PROVIDE GENDER EQUALITY FRAMEWORK </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>4.  IN GENERAL, SEVERAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK </p><p>FROM WHICH THE SAG, NGO\'S, GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS CAN </p><p>IMPLEMENT PROMOTION OF GENDER EQUALITY.  THE </p><p>COMMONWEALTH\'S "INTER-PARLIAMENTARY COUNCIL\'S PLAN OF </p><p>ACTION TO CORRECT PRESENT IMBALANCES IN THE PARTICIPATION </p><p>OF MEN AND WOMEN IN POLITICAL LIFE," ADOPTED IN MARCH OF </p><p>1994, IS USED WITHIN PARLIAMENT.  DOCUMENTS INFLUENCING </p><p>EXTERNAL LEGISLATION INCLUDE THE "CHARTER FOR EFFECTIVE </p><p>EQUALITY," PRODUCED BY THE WOMEN\'S NATIONAL COALITION AND </p><p>PRESENTED IN AUGUST OF 1994; THE BEIJING PLATFORM FOR </p><p>ACTION; THE UNCEDAW; AND THE DRAFT POLICY FOR WOMEN\'S </p><p>EMPOWERMENT, FORMULATED BY THE NOW DEFUNCT RECONSTRUCTION </p><p>AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (RDP). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>PARLIAMENT AS INSTITUTION </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>5.  THE MARCH 1996 "REPORT ON WHAT THE S. AFRICAN </p><p>PARLIAMENT HAS DONE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND </p><p>STATUS OF WOMEN IN S.A." COVERS BOTH EXTERNAL LEGISLATION </p><p>AND CHANGES WITHIN PARLIAMENT ITSELF TO PROMOTE GENDER </p><p>EQUALITY SINCE THE 1994 ELECTIONS.  S. AFRICA RANKS 7TH </p><p>IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN </p><p>PARLIAMENT, WITH 101 WOMEN OUT OF 400 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </p><p>MEMBERS, AND 16 OUT OF 90 SENATORS.  15 OUT OF 60 CHAIRS </p><p>OF COMMITTEES ARE WOMEN, AND A WOMEN\'S CAUCUS EXISTS. </p><p>GENERALLY, WOMEN REPRESENT ABOUT 26OF PARLIAMENT (THE </p><p>ANC CALLED FOR 33REPRESENTATION).  HOWEVER, THE REPORT </p><p>NOTES THAT IN SPITE OF THESE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS, WOMEN </p><p>ARE STILL NOT SPEAKING OUT TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL, AND </p><p>PARLIAMENT REMAINS A MALE-DOMINATED INSTITUTION.  TO </p><p>RECTIFY THIS, THE WORKING HOURS OF PARLIAMENT ARE BEING </p><p>RE-EXAMINED IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE "MANY WOMEN MP\'S WHO </p><p>HAVE DOMESTIC AND CHILD-CARE RESPONSIBILITIES."  THE </p><p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE FOR THE SUPPORT STAFF ARE </p><p>ALSO BEING RE-EXAMINED, AS WOMEN IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN </p><p>DISPROPORTIONATELY GIVEN SHORT TERM CONTRACTS WITH NO </p><p>BENEFITS. FINALLY, A CRECHE/NURSERY HAS RECENTLY BEEN </p><p>CREATED IN PARLIAMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>LEGISLATIVE ADVANCES </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>6.  THE UN CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF </p><p>DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW) WAS RATIFIED IN </p><p>JANUARY 1996, MAKING SOUTH AFRICA THE 131ST NATION TO </p><p>SIGN THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT.  THEN IN MARCH 1996, AN </p><p>OFFICE ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE.  THESE FOLLOWED PREVIOUS MEASURES TO </p><p>EMPOWER WOMEN INCLUDING THE 1994 ESTABLISHMENT OF AUGUST </p><p>9 AS NATIONAL WOMEN\'S DAY, AND THE 1995 INCOME TAX ACT </p><p>NO. 21, WHICH REPEALS THE DISCRIMINATORY TAX BURDEN ON </p><p>MARRIED WOMEN BY APPLYING A SINGLE INCOME TAX RATE TO ALL </p><p>INIVIDUALS, IRRESPECTIVE OF GENDER OR MARITAL STATUS. </p><p> </p><p>7.  TO ADDRESS SHORTCOMINGS IN RECENT HOUSING AND LAND </p><p>ACTS WHICH FAIL TO CONSIDER THE PROBLEMS THAT WOMEN </p><p>SPECIFICALLY MAY ENCOUNTER IN ACCESSING LAND OR HOUSING, </p><p>THE INTERIM PROTECTION OF INFORMAL LAND RIGHTS ACT (1996) </p><p>PROTECTS PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM ARE WOMEN, WHO HAVE </p><p>INSECURE AND INFORMAL RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN LAND. </p><p>SIMILARLY, THE COMMUNAL PROPERTY ASSOCIATIONS BILL, IF </p><p>PASSED, WOULD PROVIDE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH THE </p><p>COLLECTIVE ABILITY TO ACQUIRE, HOLD AND MANAGE PROPERTY. </p><p> </p><p>8.  THE WATER RATIONALISATION AND AMENDMENT ACT (1994) </p><p>CALLS FOR WOMEN TO COMPRISE ONE-THIRD OF LOCAL WATER </p><p>SUPPLY AND SANITATION COMMITTEES, THUS ENABLING THEM TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN THE PLANNING, DESIGN, AND CONTROL </p><p>OF WATER SCHEMES.  THE SOCIAL ASSISTANCE ACT AND </p><p>AMENDMENT ACTS (1992/94) PROVIDE FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, </p><p>MAINTENANCE GRANTS TO PARENTS FOR THE CARE OF THEIR </p><p>CHILDREN.  HOWEVER, THE AGED PERSONS AMENDMENT ACT (1994) </p><p>GENERALLY HURTS WOMEN BY DOING JUST THE OPPOSITE, </p><p>REPEALING AN ATTENDANT\'S ALLOWANCE FOR HOME-CARE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  LABOR ACTS:  THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>LABOUR COUNCIL ACT 35 BROADENED THE DEFINITION OF FARM </p><p>WORKER TO INCLUDE DOMESTIC WORKERS ON FARMS; THIS </p><p>BENEFITTED SOME WOMEN, BUT IT EXCLUDED SEASONAL AND </p><p>CASUAL FARM LABOURERS, OFTEN WOMEN AS WELL.  SIMILARLY, </p><p>THE LABOUR RELATIONS ACT OFFERS JOB SECURITY FOR DOMESTIC </p><p>WORKERS AND PROHIBITS SEXUALLY DISCRIMINATORY CLAUSES IN </p><p>A UNION\'S CONSTITUTION, BUT VIOLATIONS STILL OCCUR, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE JUNE 17 JOHNNESBURG DAILY "SOWETAN."  IN </p><p>TERMS OF BUSINESS, A RECENTLY PASSED SMALL BUSINESS BILL </p><p>BENEFITS WOMEN BY CREATING AN INSTITUTIONAL AND </p><p>REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROMOTION OF SMALL, MEDIUM </p><p>AND MICRO-ENTERPRISES. </p><p> </p><p>10.  BUDGET:  THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE IN </p><p>CONJUNCTION WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR A DEMOCRATIC </p><p>ALTERNATIVE IN SOUTH AFRICA (IDASA) SPONSORED A WOMEN\'S </p><p>BUDGET INITIATIVE IN MARCH 1996 TO IDENTIFY THE BUDGETARY </p><p>CHANGES NECESSARY TO IMPACT ON SPECIFIC WOMEN\'S LIVES. </p><p>DURING THE 1996 PARLIAMENTARY DELIBERATIONS ON THE BUDGET </p><p>A NUMBER OF OFFICIALS DID PROVIDE INFORMATION ASSESSING </p><p>GENDER-SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR BUDGETS, AS WELL AS </p><p>THEIR DEPARTMENTS\' EFFORTS TO PROMOTE WOMEN. </p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p>HEALTH </p><p>------ </p><p>11. ABORTION BILL:  ON JULY 3 1996, THE CABINET APPROVED </p><p>A BILL WHICH WOULD LIBERALIZE CURRENT ABORTION LAWS AND </p><p>PROVIDE MORE EQUAL ACCESS TO HELP.  (SEE SEPTEL) </p><p> </p><p>12.  FREE HEALTH CARE:  A PRESIDENTIAL LEAD PROJECT </p><p>SPEARHEADED UNDER THE FORMER RECONSTRUCTION AND </p><p>DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (RDP) IS PROVIDING FREE HEALTH CARE </p><p>FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN UNDER SIX. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>13.  NEWSPAPERS REPORT THAT EVERY SIX DAYS, A WOMAN IS </p><p>KILLED IN S. AFRICA BY HER HUSBAND OR BOYFRIEND.  THE </p><p>PREVENTION OF FAMILY VIOLENCE ACT OF 1993 MAKES IT EASIER </p><p>FOR WOMEN TO OBTAIN INTERDICTS AGAINST THIER ABUSIVE </p><p>HUSBANDS AND PARTNERS.  THIS LAW ALSO DEFINES MARITAL </p><p>RAPE AS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. CHERYL CAROLUS, ACTING ANC </p><p>SECRETARY-GENERAL, TOLD EMBASSY OFFICIALS THAT ALTHOUGH </p><p>THIS LAW IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE IN THE </p><p>WORLD, TO DATE FEWER THAN TEN WOMEN HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE </p><p>OF IT.  GIVEN THE HIGH INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF </p><p>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN S. </p><p>AFRICA, THE SAG HAD COMMITTED SPECIFICALLY TO </p><p>ESTABLISHING MORE CENTERS FOR BATTERED WOMEN, YET TO WHAT </p><p>EXTENT THIS IS BEING IMPLEMENTED IS UNCLEAR. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>WATCHDOG INSTITUTIONS </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>14.   A HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION WHICH INVESTIGATES </p><p>VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT ON MEASURES NEEDED TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>IS UP AND RUNNING. FOLLOWING IN ITS FOOTSTEPS, THE </p><p>COMMISSION ON GENDER EQUALITY ACT OF MID-1996, WILL </p><p>ESTABLISH A COMMISSION TO PROMOTE GENDER EQUALITY AND TO </p><p>ADVISE/MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PARLIAMENT OR ANY OTHER </p><p>LEGISLATURE AFFECTING WOMEN. </p><p> </p><p>15.  CONFERENCES:  MANY FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES TO BEIJING </p><p>HAVE TAKEN PLACE BOTH IN GOVERNMENT AND THROUGH NGO\'S </p><p>WHICH ILLUSTRATE S. AFRICA\'S COMMITMENT TO REFORM </p><p>BENEFITTING WOMEN. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND </p><p>SUPPORT THE SAG\'S INITIATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>CLAPP </p><p></p></div>
