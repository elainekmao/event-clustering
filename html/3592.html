(C)  SUMMARY:  A PROTESTANT PASTOR FROM DAK LAK </p><p>PROVINCE RECENTLY MET WITH CONGENOFFS TO DISCUSS THE </p><p>CURRENT SITUATION THERE, WHICH HE CHARACTERIZED AS THE </p><p>PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTING TO "ERADICATE" </p><p>PROTESTANTISM.  HE SAID PROTESTANT FAMILIES WERE NOW </p><p>FORBIDDEN TO WORSHIP TOGETHER IN GROUPS AND HAD BEEN </p><p>TOLD - AT LEAST IN ONE VILLAGE -- THEY COULD NOT </p><p>TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE PROVINCE.  HE BELIEVES IT IS </p><p>BECAUSE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES FEAR THESE VILLAGERS </p><p>WILL TRAVEL TO HO CHI MINH CITY TO TELL THE CONSULATE </p><p>GENERAL ABOUT THEIR SITUATION.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE </p><p>- NO BEATINGS, BROKEN FINGERS, ETC., AS WE HAVE HEARD </p><p>IN OTHER CENTRAL HIGHLANDS CASES.  THE PASTOR WAS </p><p>AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE VALUE OF USG TRAVEL TO THE </p><p>HIGHLANDS, NOTING "IT INCREASES PROBLEMS FOR US."  AT </p><p>THE CONCLUSION OF THE 90-MINUTE MEETING, THE PASTOR </p><p>ASKED CONGEN FOR "FUNDS" TO HELP DEFRAY THE COST OF </p><p>HIS TRIP TO HO CHI MINH CITY TO IMPART THIS </p><p>INFORMATION.  END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  PASTOR Y SIOK NIE (ALSO CALLED BY HIS </p><p>CHRISTIAN NAME, "STEVENS") WAS INTRODUCED TO </p><p>CONGENOFFS BY A HO CHI MINH CITY CONTACT, DR. SIU YA </p><p>KOP (ALSO CALLED BY HIS CHRISTIAN NAME, "DR. JAKUB"), </p><p>WHO IS FAIRLY WELL KNOWN TO POST.   JAKUB SAID THE </p><p>PASTOR WAS HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02090  01 OF 02  271016Z </p><p>3.  (C)   ACCORDING TO PASTOR STEVENS, RECENTLY DAK </p><p>LAK PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES AT ALL LEVELS (PROVINCIAL, </p><p>DISTRICT, COMMUNE, VILLAGE, HAMLET) HAVE CRACKED DOWN </p><p>ON PROTESTANTS WHO ARE PRACTICING OUTSIDE THE "LEGAL" </p><p>BOUNDARIES OF A RECOGNIZED RELIGION.  CURRENTLY, ONLY </p><p>TWO (ONE ETHNIC MINORITY AND ONE VIETNAMESE KINH) </p><p>PROTESTANT CHURCHES OUT OF THE 400-PLUS CONGREGATIONS </p><p>WERE APPROVED.  STEVENS IMPLIED, BUT DID NOT </p><p>SPECIFICALLY STATE, THAT THIS WAS BY CHOICE OF THE </p><p>CHURCH/CONGREGATION, NOT BECAUSE THE COMMITTEE FOR </p><p>RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS OR ANY GOVERNMENT ENTITY HAD </p><p>REJECTED AN APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL.   PROTESTANT </p><p>FAMILIES HAVE BEEN WARNED BY AUTHORITIES NOT TO </p><p>WORSHIP TOGETHER AT HOUSE CHURCHES OR IN TRADITIONAL </p><p>"RONG" MEETING HOUSES.  BUT IN FACT, STEVENS SAID THEY </p><p>CONTINUED TO DO SO WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  PASTOR STEVENS ALSO TURNED OVER VIETNAMESE- </p><p>LANGUAGE DOCUMENTS, WHICH WERE TESTIMONIES FROM OTHER </p><p>PROTESTANT BELIEVERS ABOUT THEIR TREATMENT BY THE </p><p>POLICE.  WHILE ALL THE INDIVIDUALS ALLEGED HARASSMENT </p><p>- PHONE CALLS, VISITS TO THEIR HOMES OR WORKPLACES, </p><p>PRESSURE TO RENOUNCE THEIR FAITH OR ACKNOWLEDGE THAT </p><p>IT IS ILLOGICAL, CONFISCATION OF RELIGIOUS ITEMS - </p><p>THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS OF PHYSICAL HARM.  OTHER </p><p>DOCUMENTS WERE LETTERS OF PROTEST SENT TO VARIOUS </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY AND GVN AGENCIES, NOTABLY THE CENTRAL </p><p>PROPAGANDA COMMITTEE, THE COMMITTEE ON RELIGIOUS </p><p>AFFAIRS, THE DAK LAK PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, </p><p>AND THE DAK LAK PROVINCIAL COMMITTEE ON RELIGIOUS </p><p>AFFAIRS.  THE WRITERS HAD RECEIVED EITHER NO RESPONSE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02090  01 OF 02  271016Z </p><p>OR A RESPONSE DIRECTING THEM TO MAKE A POLICE REPORT, </p><p>ACCORDING TO STEVENS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ONE UNSIGNED DOCUMENT, PERHAPS A PAGE TAKEN </p><p>FROM A SCHOOL NOTEBOOK, CONTAINED NOTES FROM A COURSE </p><p>CONDUCTED BY THE PROVINCIAL COMMUNIST PARTY\'S </p><p>PROPAGANDA COMMITTEE.   THE WRITER SAYS THAT OPPONENTS </p><p>OF THE VIETNAMESE REGIME ARE "PUPPETS OF THE AMERICAN </p><p>EMPIRE."  FURTHER, THE OPPONENTS\' GOAL IS TO DIVIDE </p><p>VIETNAM INTO FOUR PARTS - H\'MONG, DEGA, KHMER KROM, </p><p>AND CHAMPA.  THE GVN IS "AWARE THAT THE DEGA </p><p>PROTESTANTS CHANGED THEIR NAME TO TAY NGUYEN </p><p>PROTESTANTS AFTER THE FEBRUARY 2001 DISTURBANCES." </p><p>THE GVN\'S OBJECTIVE IS TO ERADICATE PROTESTANTISM BY </p><p>2005, ACCORDING TO THESE NOTES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  PASTOR STEVENS CLAIMED THAT EA KAR VILLAGERS </p><p>HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE DAK LAK PROVINCE. </p><p>HE HIMSELF HAD OBTAINED PERMISSION TO TRAVEL TO HCMC </p><p>UNDER THE GUISE OF VISITING HIS SON HERE.  HE SAID HE </p><p>SUSPECTED THE REAL REASON AUTHORITIES DID NOT WANT </p><p>VILLAGERS TO TRAVEL TO HCMC WAS BECAUSE THEY FEARED </p><p>THEY WOULD GO TO THE CONSULATE AND RELATE THEIR </p><p>SITUATION. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ5574 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  02090  02 OF 02  271017Z </p><p>ACTION EAP-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  DOEE-00  PERC-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    ED-01 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    HHS-01   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-00   DRL-02 </p><p>      G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /011W </p><p>                  ------------------DE7B02  271017Z /38 </p><p>R 271003Z AUG 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 7386 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY PHNOM PENH </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENTIANE </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 002090 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV, PRM, AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  PASTOR STEVENS ALSO ASKED CONGENOFFS WHY THEY </p><p>WERE NOT ABLE TO COME TO AN EASTER SUNRISE SERVICE AT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  02090  02 OF 02  271017Z </p><p>HIS CHURCH JUST OUTSIDE BUON ME THUOT, THE DAK LAK </p><p>PROVINCIAL CAPITAL.  HE SAID THAT CONGREGATION MEMBERS </p><p>HAD BEEN INFORMED OF THE VISIT AND HAD PREPARED A </p><p>WELCOME.  ON EASTER MORNING, THEY WERE TOLD THAT </p><p>CONGENOFFS WERE "DELAYED", BUT THEY WAITED UNTIL </p><p>MIDNIGHT JUST IN CASE.  [CONGEN NOTE: PER REFTEL, </p><p>AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT, CG, AND CONGENOFFS TRAVELED TO </p><p>THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OVER THE EASTER WEEKEND OF MARCH </p><p>30-31.  THE EXTERNAL RELATIONS OFFICE IN HCMC HAD </p><p>INFORMED CONGEN THAT KON TUM PROVINCE WOULD RECEIVE </p><p>THEM FOR AN EASTER CHURCH SERVICE, BUT TO SPLIT UP THE </p><p>GROUP BETWEEN KON TUM AND BUON ME THUOT (FIVE HOURS </p><p>APART BY CAR) WOULD BE A LOGISTICAL PROBLEM.  WHETHER </p><p>THIS DECISION WAS EVER CONVEYED TO DAK LAK PROVINCE </p><p>AUTHORITIES, OR WHETHER THERE IS A MORE NEFARIOUS </p><p>REASON BEHIND THIS BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATION, WE DO </p><p>NOT KNOW.  END NOTE.]   CONGENOFFS APOLOGIZED FOR THE </p><p>MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISAPPOINTMENT, WHILE EXPRESSING </p><p>SURPRISE, SINCE WE HAD BEEN INFORMED OF THE KON TUM </p><p>DECISION TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE TRIP TOOK PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  COMMENT:  CONGEN NOTES THAT THESE ABOVE </p><p>STORIES OF HARASSMENT ARE SIMILAR, THOUGH LESS </p><p>DRAMATIC, THAN PREVIOUS ONES THAT WE HAVE REPORTED ON. </p><p>THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT RELIGIOUS HARASSMENT </p><p>CONTINUES IN SOME PARTS OF THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. </p><p>HOWEVER, THE PASTORS AND BELIEVERS THERE SEEM TO </p><p>CONSIDER ALL HARASSMENT - AS ABHORRENT AS IT MAY BE - </p><p>TO BE PERSECUTION.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE VALUE OF USG </p><p>VISITS TO THE TROUBLED PROVINCES, PASTOR STEVENS WAS </p><p>FORTHRIGHT:  "YOUR VISITS CREATE MORE PROBLEMS FOR US, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  02090  02 OF 02  271017Z </p><p>BUT WE REALIZE IT IS PART OF YOUR DUTY TO GO </p><p>INVESTIGATE SITUATIONS."  WHEN PRESSED AS TO WHETHER </p><p>HE MEANT WE SHOULD MAKE NO FURTHER VISITS, STEVENS </p><p>BECAME AMBIVALENT:  "WELL, THEY WILL NEVER ALLOW YOU </p><p>TO SEE THE TRUTH, BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO </p><p>MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION ABOUT THE VALUE OF A VISIT." </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  OF FURTHER CONCERN WAS THE REQUEST FOR MONEY. </p><p>THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT ANY OF OUR FIRST OR </p><p>SECONDHAND SOURCES HAD REQUESTED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>FOR THEIR "TRAVEL COSTS." CONGEN UNDERSTANDS THAT LIFE </p><p>IS HARD FOR HOUSE CHURCH PASTORS, ESPECIALLY IF THEIR </p><p>CONGREGATION\'S NUMBERS ARE DIMINISHING DUE TO </p><p>HARASSMENT.  HOWEVER, THE REQUEST FOR USD$33 FOR </p><p>TRAVEL EXPENSES WAS HIGH - FOR A PROVINCE WHERE THE </p><p>AVERAGE PER CAPITA INCOME IS UNDER USD$250. </p><p>CONGENOFFS EXPLAINED THEY COULD NOT PAY FOR TRAVEL </p><p>COSTS, AND IN ANY CASE WOULD NOT WANT ANY SUGGESTION </p><p>OF AN APPEARANCE OF THE USG PAYING FOR INFORMATION. </p><p>CONGENOFFS URGED PASTOR STEVENS TO FOLLOW HIS OWN </p><p>CONSCIENCE ON PROVIDING INFORMATION TO US.  CONGENOFFS </p><p>ALSO SAID THEY COULD NOT SET A PRECEDENT BY DONATING </p><p>PERSONAL MONIES TO THE PASTOR.  CONGEN CONTINUES TO </p><p>BELIEVE THAT RELIABLE SECONDHAND INFORMATION AND </p><p>DOCUMENTS CARRIED DOWN FROM THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS ARE </p><p>VALUABLE REPORTING MATERIALS, AND WOULD BE DISMAYED IF </p><p>THESE SOURCES DRIED UP.  DR. JAKUB EXPRESSED SHOCK AT </p><p>HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW\'S REQUEST, AND EMPHATICALLY TOLD </p><p>CONGENOFFS AFTER THE MEETING AND IN A FOLLOW UP PHONE </p><p>CALL THAT HE HAD HAD NO IDEA PASTOR STEVENS WOULD ASK </p><p>FOR MONEY. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  02090  02 OF 02  271017Z </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, CONGENOFFS HAVE </p><p>RECEIVED A NUMBER OF E-MAIL AND FAX MESSAGES FROM </p><p>PROTESTANT PASTORS ABOUT EVERY POLICE DETENTION (SOME </p><p>LASTING AN HOUR OR LESS), "INVITATION TO APPEAR AT THE </p><p>POLICE STATION," HOUSE SEARCH (THE POLICE SOMETIMES </p><p>CARRY AWAY TELEVISION SETS, RADIOS, ETC.), OR PHONE </p><p>CALL WARNING PEOPLE "NOT TO FOLLOW DANGEROUS/ILLEGAL </p><p>RELIGIONS."  MESSAGES SOMETIMES COME ANONYMOUSLY VIA </p><p>THE MESSAGING DEVICE ON CONGENOFFS MOBILE PHONES.  CG </p><p>HCMC IS SYMPATHETIC TO THESE CONCERNS, BUT LACKS THE </p><p>RESOURCES TO FOLLOW UP ON EACH REPORT OR TO TRACK DOWN </p><p>THE ANONYMOUS ONES.  THESE INCIDENTS ARE ALL RECORDED, </p><p>AND WILL BE REFLECTED IN OUR ANNUAL FREEDOM OF </p><p>RELIGION REPORT. </p><p> </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
