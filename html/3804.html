<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 005527 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: HAMZA MANSOUR AND THE IAF/MB:  MODERATE LEADERSHIP </p><p>STRETCHED BETWEEN ITS FOLLOWING AND THE GOJ </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 04236 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM.  REASONS: 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1 (C) SUMMARY.  Since his July 17 meeting with R Special </p><p>Coordinator Christopher Ross (reftel), Islamic Action Front </p><p>Secretary General Sheikh Hamza Mansour has endured harsh </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>criticism from those in and around the IAF/Muslim Brotherhood </p><p>for "speaking with the enemy."  Mansour\'s recent appearances </p><p>and press interviews, combined with information from embassy </p><p>sources, indicate that he is making an effort to remain in </p><p>line (at least publicly) with the more radical views of the </p><p>rank and file MB membership.  His position appears to be </p><p>representative of the MB leadership\'s increasingly </p><p>uncomfortable relationship with the more militant MB </p><p>membership.  There are also rumors of a power struggle within </p><p>the "moderate" leadership of the MB, and Mansour may be </p><p>attempting to assure his internal leadership position by </p><p>maintaining his support from the rank and file.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>FALLOUT FROM MEETING WITH ROSS </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  On July 17 Ambassador Ross met with Mansour and two </p><p>other Islamic Action Front leaders (reftel).  In recent </p><p>memory, Mansour has been the only member of the IAF </p><p>leadership to meet with embassy officials.  Despite his </p><p>public invectives against the USG, Mansour has consistently </p><p>affirmed the value of dialogue between the USG and the MB. </p><p>In the face of harsh criticism in the local media by MB </p><p>commentators, Mansour has been publicly unapologetic for </p><p>"meeting with the enemy behind the back of the GOJ." </p><p> </p><p>3. (C)  Notwithstanding his defense of the July 17 meeting </p><p>with USG officials, Mansour spoke at a rally at the MB center </p><p>in early August.  According to London based Al-Sharq </p><p>Al-Awsat, Mansour told the crowd that the "operation" (i.e. </p><p>suicide bombing) against the Hebrew University (which killed </p><p>eight, including four AMCITS) cost USD 50,000 and that such </p><p>large costs necessitate giving large financial aid to the </p><p>Palestinian people to carry out similar operations in the </p><p>future.  (Note:  The article did not directly quote Mansour, </p><p>but paraphrased him.  Post has had no contact with Mansour </p><p>since his July 17 meeting with Ambassador Ross, and has </p><p>therefore not been able to express outrage at such comments </p><p>directly or get his version of what was actually said). </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>"MANSOUR DIDN\'T MEAN IT" </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On August 18, poloff met with Ibrahim Gharaibeh </p><p>(strictly protect) an East Banker and former member of the </p><p>MB.  Gharaibeh, currently in a master\'s degree program that </p><p>focuses on elderly care, said that he left the MB because it </p><p>"stopped focusing on charity and became a movement purely </p><p>concerned with politics."  According to Gharaibeh, the MB </p><p>leadership is "very smart, and wiser than its following," and </p><p>is pursuing a (comment: relatively) moderate course on </p><p>domestic and foreign politics.  Gharaibeh said that, within </p><p>the leadership, Mansour is more moderate than most.  In order </p><p>to keep his support among the ranks of the MB however, he </p><p>makes speeches "on a hot level," that feed the rank and </p><p>file\'s appetite for invective against the USG.  In the end, </p><p>according to Gharaibeh, Mansour "doesn\'t always mean" what he </p><p>is saying publicly.  "If the moderate leaders spoke their </p><p>true thoughts to the average MB member, they would be </p><p>burned," Gharaibeh said. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)  Gharaibeh said the current MB leadership has adopted </p><p>short-term strategies to maintain control of the organization </p><p>in the face of formidable extremist sentiment within the MB. </p><p>Privately, moderates are debating the merits and morality of </p><p>suicide bombings.  Publicly, they are lambasting the USG and </p><p>supporting "martyrdom" operations against Israel.  While </p><p>Gharaibeh does not believe that the moderates, as a group, </p><p>are in serious danger of losing control of the MB, he does </p><p>believe that some "moderates" are tarring others with the </p><p>pro-USG brush in an attempt to gain rank and file support. </p><p>This, he says, is the kind of dynamic that creates an </p><p>environment in which Mansour publicly praises the Hebrew </p><p>University attack. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>MB LEADERSHIP\'S LONG-STANDING COOPERATION </p><p>WITH GOJ BECOMING TOO HEAVY A BURDEN? </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  On September 22 poloff met with human rights </p><p>advocate Sa\'eda Kilani.  (Note: although Kilani is a human </p><p>rights advocate, her family is well-connected within the </p><p>judiciary and security services here).  Kilani\'s commentary </p><p>on Mansour echoed that of Gharaibeh\'s.  "The IAF and MB </p><p>leadership have cooperated with the government regarding </p><p>extremists, such as Ba\'athists and communists, for decades, </p><p>but the (IAF/MB) leadership is stressed right now." </p><p>7.  (C) One root cause of this "stress" Kilani noted, is the </p><p>lack of channels through which the MB leadership can get out </p><p>its message.  "Right now, the only political organizations </p><p>left are the professional associations," Kilani said, "and </p><p>that is not enough. The opposition are left more frustrated </p><p>and are losing faith in their leaders." </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  The MB leadership\'s inner-workings are not always </p><p>easy to understand, but the recent activity by Mansour seems </p><p>to indicate that the "moderate" leadership of the MB/IAF is, </p><p>at the least, having difficulty managing its increasingly </p><p>frustrated following. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
