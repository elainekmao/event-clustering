<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001595 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KAMPALA FOR AID-D. LIBERI </p><p>RIYADH FOR POL- R. HANKS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12598:N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ASSOCIATIONS CHALLENGE ELECTORAL </p><p>COMMISSION\'S AMENED REGISTRATION GUIDELINES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REFTEL: AUBJA 1496 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary: The thirty-three political associations railed </p><p>against party registration guidelines the Independent </p><p>National Electoral Commission (INEC) revised on 5/17, </p><p>arguing that the amended guidelines were as unconstitutional </p><p>as the ones they rejected earlier this month (reftel). </p><p>Though the association plans to meet INEC\'s May 28 </p><p>application deadline, they are threatening to take INEC to </p><p>court over provision they believe contravene the 1999 </p><p>Constitution. This is the latest in the volley in the </p><p>running feud between the yet to be registered associations </p><p>and INEC. While some of what we see is theatrics, this </p><p>episode demonstrates the lack of confidence the association </p><p>has in INEC. They continue to believe that the "I" in INEC </p><p>does not stand for "independent" but "instrument" of the </p><p>President. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>Associations challenge INEC draft guidelines </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. Thirty-three political associations seeking party </p><p>registration unanimously rejected the amended draft </p><p>guidelines INEC issued on May 7. INEC had amended the </p><p>guidelines after a stormy meeting with representatives of </p><p>the association on May 17. The association argues vehemently </p><p>that the provisions of the guidelines exceed constitutional </p><p>requirements. The associations claim that INEC cannot impose </p><p>requirements not specifically contained in sections 222, </p><p>223, and 224 of the 1991 constitution-the sections relating </p><p>to political parties. Section 222 (c) requires parties to </p><p>provide INEC with one copy of their constitution, but INEC </p><p>wants twenty copies. Section 222 (a) requires parties </p><p>provide INEC names and address of the political parties </p><p>national officers; however, INEC requires signatures and </p><p>"state and local government area of origin" for all party </p><p>members. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. INEC Chairman Dr. Abel Guobadia asserts that sections </p><p>relied on by the associations are just minimal standards </p><p>that the constitution contemplate and that the National </p><p>Assembly and INEC will produce additions and laws of </p><p>regulation, respectively. Guobadia cites Section 228 of the </p><p>Constitution as giving INEC the power to register parties </p><p>and establish regulations beyond what is specifically </p><p>contained in the Constitution so long as INEC does not </p><p>isolate provisions of the Constitution. The parties want the </p><p>courts to decide on whether the guidelines are </p><p>constitutional. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment: Many of the issues raised by the association </p><p>seem unimportant. However, the associations contend that </p><p>they must fight the Electoral Commission in these minor, </p><p>alleged constitutional violations. If they acquiesce, they </p><p>fear they will be in a weaker position to argue with INEC on </p><p>more serious arrogation of authority in the future. Again </p><p>this fear that INEC is setting to entrap them illustrates </p><p>how much the association distrusts INEC. End Comment </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>The 10/24 rule and the Election Law </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. The most controversial provision of the May guidelines </p><p>required that parties win 10% of the seats in local </p><p>elections in 24 states to be eligible to participate in </p><p>state and federal elections. The amended guideline makes no </p><p>explicit reference to this requirement. Some observers </p><p>believe this omission means that INEC will no longer hold </p><p>parties to any requirement. However, others point to the </p><p>fact that the amended guideline states that comply with the </p><p>2001 electoral act which still includes the 10/24 threshold. </p><p>They believe that INEC has not dropped the 10/24 threshold </p><p>but was trying to use subterfuge and indirection to sneak </p><p>through the backdoor a provision the association openly </p><p>railed against. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>INEC: Partial to the Presidency? </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. The association has also excoriated INEC for basing its </p><p>guidelines on the discredited 2001 election law. The </p><p>National Assembly amended the law and measures are now </p><p>awaiting President assent. INEC\'s critics state the body </p><p>should have based its registration guidelines on the 2002 </p><p>measure not its tainted predecessor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. The association seems intent on bullying INEC inch-by- </p><p>inch. This means that there will be other issues the </p><p>association will bring to court. Resorting to the court is a </p><p>function of the association\'s suspicion. Some of their </p><p>doubts are exaggerated; some are well founded. While the </p><p>courts can have a salutary effect in resolving some issues, </p><p>the judiciary cannot cure what requires a political remedy- </p><p>the perception that INEC is an appendage and not an </p><p>independent entity.  In the end, INEC has to do a much </p><p>better job consulting with the political associations and </p><p>civil society and take action to demonstrate its </p><p>impartiality. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
