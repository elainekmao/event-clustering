<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 06 PRAGUE 11316 </p><p> </p><p>FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </p><p> </p><p>VIENNA ALSO HOLD FOR BRATISLAVA </p><p> </p><p>USVIENNA FOR USDEL CSCE AND UNVIE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:N/A </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, CZ </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE CZECH CONSTITUTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS VIENNA AU, SERIAL NO. AU2412060192 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  THE CZECH REPUBLIC (CR) CONSTITUTION (FULL </p><p>TEXT REFTEL), WHICH WILL TAKE EFFECT JANUARY 1, IS </p><p>EXPLICITLY PART OF THE CR\'S EFFORT TO PROJECT ITSELF </p><p>RAPIDLY AND FULLY INTO THE "FAMILY OF EUROPEAN AND WORLD </p><p>DEMOCRACIES."  THE FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUENT UNIT IS NOT </p><p>THE CZECH PEOPLE AS A GROUP, BUT RATHER THE INDIVIDUAL </p><p>CITIZEN OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC, WHOSE HUMAN AND CIVIL </p><p>RIGHTS ARE ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEED AND PROTECTED BY AN </p><p>INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY, INCLUDING A CONSTITUTIONAL COURT </p><p>AND SUPREME COURT.  THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF MINORITY VIEWPOINTS, BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE </p><p>THE PRINCIPLE THAT NATIONAL OR ETHNIC MINORITIES HAVE </p><p>SPECIAL RIGHTS BY VIRTUE OF THEIR NATIONAL OR ETHNIC </p><p>DISTINCTIVENESS. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE INDEPENDENT CZECH REPUBLIC WILL BE A </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, WITH A BICAMERAL LEGISLATURE </p><p>(CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND SENATE).  THE PRIME MINISTER, </p><p>HIS DEPUTIES, AND OTHER MINISTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE TO THE </p><p>CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  A MAJOR FUNCTION OF THE SENATE IS </p><p>TO ENSURE CONTINUITY WHEN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES CANNOT </p><p>FULFILL ITS RESPONSIBILITIES; OTHERWISE, IT IS FAR LESS </p><p>POWERFUL THAN THE CHAMBER.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>REPUBLIC IS ELECTED BY BOTH CHAMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, AND </p><p>EXERCISES POWERS SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER THAN THOSE OF THE </p><p>GERMAN PRESIDENT, BUT LESS THAN THOSE OF THE PRESIDENT </p><p>OF FRANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE, </p><p>AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES, THE CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHES A </p><p>SUPREME INSPECTION OFFICE (SOMEWHAT COMPARABLE TO THE </p><p>GAO) AND THE CZECH NATIONAL BANK.  THE CONSTITUTION ALSO </p><p>PROVIDES FOR WHAT IS TERMED "TERRITORIAL </p><p>SELF-ADMINISTRATION" AT THE LEVEL OF MUNICIPALITIES AND </p><p>OF REGIONS OR LANDS, BUT DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE </p><p>MUNICIPAL OR REGIONAL AUTONOMY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>BASIC PRINCIPLES </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  ACCORDING TO THE PREAMBLE, IT IS THE "CITIZENS OF </p><p>THE CZECH REPUBLIC IN BOHEMIA, MORAVIA, AND SILESIA" WHO </p><p>ADOPT THE CONSTITUTION, THROUGH THEIR FREELY ELECTED </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES.  THE PREAMBLE AND CHAPTER ONE, "BASIC </p><p>PROVISIONS," REFER AT SEVERAL POINTS TO THE CR AS A </p><p>"STATE OF LAWS", BASED ON THE EQUALITY OF ALL CITIZENS </p><p>AND RESPECT FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN DIGNITY, </p><p>FREEDOM, AND HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS.  INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ACCORDS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS TO </p><p>WHICH THE CR HAS COMMITTED ITSELF ARE BINDING AND TAKE </p><p>PRECEDENCE OVER NATIONAL LAW, AND THE </p><p>POST-VELVET-REVOLUTION CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND </p><p>FREEDOMS IS DEFINED AS PART OF THE "CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER </p><p>OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC."  THE CONSTITUTION FORBIDS ANY </p><p>CHANGES IN THE ESSENTIAL ATTRIBUTES OF THE CR AS A </p><p>DEMOCRATIC STATE OF LAWS, AND FORBIDS THE INTERPRETATION </p><p>OF LEGAL NORMS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO THREATEN THE </p><p>FOUNDATIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ALL STATE POWER DERIVES FROM THE PEOPLE, AND THE </p><p>POWER OF THE STATE IS DEFINED AS SERVING ALL CITIZENS. </p><p>THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IS BASED ON FREE COMPETITION OF </p><p>POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH MUST RESPECT FUNDAMENTAL </p><p>DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND REJECT FORCE AS A MEANS OF </p><p>ADVANCING THEIR INTERESTS.  WHILE THE WILL OF THE </p><p>MAJORITY, EXPRESSED THROUGH THE FREE BALLOT, IS THE </p><p>BASIS OF POLITICAL DECISIONS, THE CONSTITUTION STATES </p><p>EXPLICITLY: "DECISIONS BY THE MAJORITY PROVIDE FOR THE </p><p>PROTECTION OF MINORITIES." </p><p> </p><p>THE LEGISLATURE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR A BICAMERAL </p><p>LEGISLATURE:  A 200-MEMBER CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES </p><p>(SUCCESSOR TO THE CZECH NATIONAL COUNCIL) AND AN </p><p>81-MEMBER SENATE.  THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, BY FAR THE </p><p>MORE POWERFUL OF THE TWO HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, IS </p><p>ELECTED EVERY FOUR YEARS, UNDER A SYSTEM OF PROPORTIONAL </p><p>REPRESENTATION.  ELECTIONS TO THE SENATE WILL TAKE PLACE </p><p>EVERY TWO YEARS, WITH ONE THIRD OF THE SEATS BEING </p><p>FILLED EACH TIME.  (THE TERM FOR SENATORS IS SIX </p><p>YEARS.)  SENATORS WILL BE ELECTED FROM SINGLE-MEMBER </p><p>DISTRICTS.  WHILE DEPUTIES NEED ONLY BE TWENTY-ONE YEARS </p><p>OLD, SENATORS MUST BE AT LEAST FORTY. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THOUGH SIMILAR IN THEIR ARRAY OF OFFICERS, COMMITTEE </p><p>STRUCTURES, AND THE IMMUNITIES OF THEIR MEMBERS, THE TWO </p><p>HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT HAVE SOME RATHER DIFFERENT </p><p>FUNCTIONS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE ONLY TO THE </p><p>CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, AND ONLY THE CHAMBER CAN APPROVE </p><p>THE BUDGET AND THE FINAL YEAR-END ACCOUNTING.  ON THE </p><p>OTHER HAND, THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC CAN DISSOLVE </p><p>THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES UNDER CAREFULLY DEFINED </p><p>CONDITIONS OF LEGISLATIVE GRIDLOCK. (SEE PARA 13.)  WHEN </p><p>THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES IS DISSOLVED, THE SENATE STEPS </p><p>IN AND CAN APPROVE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES PROPOSED BY THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT, OTHER THAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS, THE STATE </p><p>BUDGET, ELECTION LAWS, OR INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ON </p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, WHICH HAVE THE </p><p>FORCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.  (IN ORDER TO RETAIN ITS </p><p>VALIDITY, HOWEVER, A MEASURE PASSED BY THE SENATE MUST </p><p>BE CONFIRMED BY THE CHAMBER WHEN IT MEETS AGAIN.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND THE </p><p>SENATE IS REQUIRED TO DECLARE WAR OR APPROVE THE </p><p>STATIONING OF FOREIGN TROOPS ON CZECH SOIL.  (A SIMPLE </p><p>MAJORITY OF ALL DEPUTIES AND ALL SENATORS IS REQUIRED.) </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS REQUIRE </p><p>3/5 OF ALL DEPUTIES AND 3/5 OF ALL SENATORS PRESENT FOR </p><p>THE GIVEN VOTE.  REGULAR LAWS ONLY REQUIRE SIMPLE </p><p>MAJORITIES OF ALL DEPUTIES OR SENATORS PRESENT FOR THE </p><p>VOTE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  IN FACT, WHEN IT COMES TO REGULAR LAWS, THE CHAMBER </p><p>OF DEPUTIES IS FIRMLY IN THE DRIVER\'S SEAT.  ALL DRAFT </p><p>LAWS ARE INTRODUCED IN THE CHAMBER.  IF THE CHAMBER </p><p>APPROVES A LAW, IT PASSES IT TO THE SENATE.  IF THE </p><p>SENATE REJECTS A LAW PASSED IN THE CHAMBER, THE LAW GOES </p><p>INTO EFFECT IF THE CHAMBER APPROVES IT AGAIN BY A SIMPLE </p><p>MAJORITY OF ALL DEPUTIES.  A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF ALL </p><p>DEPUTIES IS ALSO SUFFICIENT TO OVERTURN A VETO BY THE </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC. </p><p> </p><p>9.  WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THE SENATE </p><p>DOES HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES COMPLETELY DISTINCT FROM </p><p>THOSE OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  THE SENATE MUST </p><p>APPROVE THE PRESIDENT\'S APPOINTEES TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>COURT, AND HAS THE POWER TO STRIP CONSTITUTIONAL COURT </p><p>JUDGES OF THEIR IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION.  IT IS ALSO </p><p>THE SENATE THAT HAS THE POWER TO INDICT THE PRESIDENT </p><p>FOR TREASON, THE ONLY CRIME FOR WHICH THE PRESIDENT MAY </p><p>BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED. </p><p> </p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  CHAPTER 3 OF THE CONSTITUTION DEFINES EXECUTIVE </p><p>BRANCH POWERS.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC (MINIMUM </p><p>AGE 40) IS THE CHIEF OF STATE, ELECTED AT A JOINT </p><p>SESSION OF THE TWO HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT FOR A FIVE-YEAR </p><p>TERM.  (THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT SERVE MORE THAN TWO </p><p>CONSECUTIVE TERMS.)  A SINGLE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAN </p><p>INCLUDE AS MANY AS THREE ROUNDS.  THE FIRST ROUND </p><p>REQUIRES A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF ALL DEPUTIES AND A SIMPLE </p><p>MAJORITY OF ALL SENATORS.  IN THE SECOND ROUND, A SIMPLE </p><p>MAJORITY OF DEPUTIES PRESENT AND OF SENATORS PRESENT IS </p><p>SUFFICIENT.  IN THE THIRD ROUND, A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF </p><p>ALL DEPUTIES AND SENATORS, TAKEN AS A WHOLE, IS </p><p>SUFFICIENT.  DESPITE ELECTION BY PARLIAMENT, HOWEVER, </p><p>THE PRESIDENT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE TO PARLIAMENT FOR THE </p><p>EXERCISE OF HIS OFFICE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE PRESIDENT\'S EXCLUSIVE POWERS ARE AS FOLLOWS: </p><p> </p><p>-- APPOINTS, DISMISSES, AND ACCEPTS THE RESIGNATION OF </p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>AND EMPOWERS A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS RESIGNED OR BEEN </p><p>DISMISSED TO EXERCISE ITS FUNCTIONS TEMPORARILY; </p><p> </p><p>-- APPOINTS JUDGES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN AND DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE SUPREME COURT, THE </p><p>PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME INSPECTION </p><p>OFFICE, AND THE MEMBERS OF THE BANK COUNCIL OF THE CZECH </p><p>NATIONAL BANK; </p><p> </p><p>--  CONVENES SESSIONS OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES OR </p><p>DISSOLVES THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES UNDER SPECIFIED </p><p>CONDITIONS; </p><p> </p><p>--  SIGNS LAWS, OR CAN RETURN TO PARLIAMENT LAWS IT HAS </p><p>PASSED, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS; </p><p> </p><p>--  ISSUES PARDONS, COMMUTES SENTENCES, ORDERS THAT </p><p>CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS NOT BE OPENED OR BE DISCONTINUED, </p><p>ERASES CONVICTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE PRESIDENT ALSO EXERCISES A NUMBER OF POWERS </p><p>JOINTLY WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OR OTHER AUTHORIZED </p><p>MINISTERS, IN THE SENSE THAT PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONS IN </p><p>THESE AREAS REQUIRE THE SIGNATURE OF THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>OR OTHER GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE TO TAKE EFFECT: </p><p> </p><p>--  REPRESENTS THE STATE IN EXTERNAL AFFAIRS, ACCREDITS </p><p>AND RECALLS HEADS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS, RECEIVES HEADS </p><p>OF FOREIGN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS; </p><p> </p><p>--  NEGOTIATES AND RATIFIES INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, OR </p><p>TRANSFERS SUCH RESPONSIBILITY TO THE GOVERNMENT; </p><p> </p><p>--  CALLS ELECTIONS TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND </p><p>SENATE; </p><p> </p><p>--  SUPREME COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES, APPOINTMENT AND </p><p>PROMOTION OF GENERALS; </p><p> </p><p>--  CONFERS STATE DECORATIONS; </p><p> </p><p>--  APPOINTS JUDGES; </p><p> </p><p>--  GRANTS AMNESTY. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE PRESIDENT IS EMPOWERED TO DISSOLVE THE CHAMBER </p><p>OF DEPUTIES, IF IT IS CLEARLY DEADLOCKED OR OTHERWISE </p><p>INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING ITSELF.  SPECIFICALLY, THE </p><p>PRESIDENT MAY ACT WHEN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES VOTES </p><p>NO-CONFIDENCE IN A GOVERNMENT WHOSE PRIME MINISTER WAS </p><p>NAMED BY THE PRESIDENT AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE CHAIRMAN </p><p>OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  (NOTE: AFTER TWO FAILED </p><p>ATTEMPTS TO WIN CONFIDENCE FOR A PRIME MINISTER OF HIS </p><p>OWN CHOOSING, THE PRESIDENT IS REQUIRED TO NOMINATE A </p><p>PRIME MINISTER PROPOSED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAMBER </p><p>OF DEPUTIES.)  DISSOLUTION ALSO IS POSSIBLE IF THE </p><p>CHAMBER IS ADJOURNED FOR LONGER THAN PERMISSIBLE (120 </p><p>DAYS), HAS NO QUORUM FOR THREE MONTHS, OR FAILS FOR </p><p>THREE MONTHS TO EXPRESS ITSELF ON A GOVERNMENT DRAFT LAW </p><p>ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS PLACED THE QUESTION OF </p><p>CONFIDENCE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE PRESIDENT HAS A LIMITED VETO POWER.  HE CAN </p><p>RETURN UNSIGNED A LAW OTHER THAN A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, </p><p>PROVIDING THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES WITH AN EXPLANATION. </p><p>THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES VOTES AGAIN ON THE LAW, WITH NO </p><p>AMENDMENTS ALLOWED, AND A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF ALL </p><p>DEPUTIES IS SUFFICIENT TO OVERTURN THE VETO. </p><p> </p><p>15.  WHEN THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC IS </p><p>VACANT OR THE INCUMBENT CANNOT EXERCISE HIS OFFICE, THE </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES EXERCISES MOST OF </p><p>THE FUNCTIONS IN PARA 11, MOST IMPORTANTLY THOSE HAVING </p><p>TO DO WITH APPOINTING AND DISMISSING THE GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>CONVENING OR DISSOLVING THE CHAMBER.  THE PRIME MINISTER </p><p>EXERCISES MOST OF THE FUNCTIONS IN PARA 12, INCLUDING </p><p>THE CONDUCT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND COMMAND OF THE ARMED </p><p>FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE ARTICLES DEFINING THE POWERS OF THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>ARE MUCH LESS DETAILED THAN THOSE ON PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>POWERS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE TO THE CHAMBER OF </p><p>DEPUTIES, AND AUTOMATICALLY OFFERS ITS RESIGNATION AFTER </p><p>THE CONSTITUENT SESSION OF A NEWLY-ELECTED CHAMBER OF </p><p>DEPUTIES.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC NAMES THE PRIME </p><p>MINISTER, AND, AT HIS SUGGESTION, APPOINTS THE OTHER </p><p>MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT MAKES ITS </p><p>DECISIONS AS A BODY, ON THE BASIS OF A VOTE BY A SIMPLE </p><p>MAJORITY OF ALL MEMBERS. </p><p> </p><p>THE JUDICIARY </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE </p><p>COURTS AND OF INDIVIDUAL JUDGES.  IT PROVIDES FOR A </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF FIFTEEN JUDGES, APPOINTED FOR </p><p>TEN-YEAR TERMS BY THE PRESIDENT WITH THE CONSENT OF THE </p><p>SENATE.  THE JUDGES ARE BOUND ONLY BY CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, AND THEIR MAIN </p><p>FUNCTION IS TO REVIEW LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL REGULATIONS </p><p>TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEY ARE AT VARIANCE WITH </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OR A BINDING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>AGREEMENT.  THEY ALSO RULE IN CASES WHERE STATE BODIES </p><p>ARE ACCUSED OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTS. </p><p> </p><p>18.  UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, THE PRIMARY ROLE OF THE </p><p>COURTS IS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS TO CITIZENS.  THE </p><p>REGULAR JUDICIARY CONSISTS OF THE SUPREME COURT, THE </p><p>SUPREME ADMINISTRATIVE COURT, HIGH, REGIONAL, AND </p><p>DISTRICT COURTS.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC APPOINTS </p><p>JUDGES FOR AN UNLIMITED TERM.  THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT </p><p>SPECIFY IN WHICH CASES JUDGES MAKE THEIR DECISIONS AS A </p><p>PANEL, IN WHICH CASES JUDGES MAKE THEIR DETERMINATIONS </p><p>INDIVIDUALLY, AND HOW CITIZENS OTHER THAN JUDGES MAY </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN COURT DELIBERATIONS.  THESE MATTERS ARE </p><p>LEFT TO DEFINITION BY SUBSEQUENT LAWS.  THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>GUARANTEES EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.  COURT RULINGS ARE </p><p>ALWAYS ANNOUNCED IN PUBLIC, AND COURT PROCEEDINGS ARE AS </p><p>A RULE PUBLIC.  EXCEPTIONS CAN BE SPECIFIED BY LAW.  THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION ALSO REFERS TO A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR\'S </p><p>OFFICE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE PUBLIC IN CRIMINAL </p><p>PROCEEDINGS, BUT DOES NOT DEFINE THE STATUS AND </p><p>JURISDICTION OF THE OFFICE, LEAVING THAT TO SUBSEQUENT </p><p>LAWS. </p><p> </p><p>OTHER INSTITUTIONS </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>19.  THE CONSTITUTION ALSO PROVIDES FOR A SUPREME </p><p>INSPECTION OFFICE, DEFINED AS AN INDEPENDENT BODY WHICH </p><p>PERFORMS INSPECTIONS OF THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE PROPERTY </p><p>AND FULFILLMENT OF THE STATE BUDGET.  THE PRESIDENT OF </p><p>THE REPUBLIC, UPON PROPOSAL OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, </p><p>APPOINTS THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME </p><p>INSPECTION OFFICE.  THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT, HOWEVER, </p><p>FURTHER ADDRESS THE ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE </p><p>OFFICE, LEAVING THAT TO SUBSEQUENT LAWS. </p><p> </p><p>20.  THE CZECH NATIONAL BANK, I.E. THE CENTRAL STATE </p><p>BANK, RECEIVES SIMILAR TREATMENT.  THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>DEFINES THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE BANK AS THE </p><p>MAINTENANCE OF A STABLE CURRENCY, AND STATES IT IS </p><p>POSSIBLE TO INTERVENE IN THE BANK\'S ACTIVITIES SOLELY ON </p><p>THE BASIS OF LAW.  THE PRESIDENT APPOINTS THE MEMBERS OF </p><p>THE BANK COUNCIL.  OTHER ASPECTS ARE LEFT TO BE </p><p>DETERMINED BY SUBSEQUENT LAWS. </p><p> </p><p>TERRITORIAL SELF-ADMINISTRATION </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>21.  THE MUNICIPALITY (OBEC) IS THE BASIC UNIT OF </p><p>TERRITORIAL SELF-ADMINISTRATION, WITH LANDS (ZEME) OR </p><p>REGIONS (KRAJE) AS HIGHER UNITS.  THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>ITSELF DOES NOT LAY OUT THE SIZE AND BOUNDARIES OF THESE </p><p>UNITS.  (NOTE: USE OF THE TERM "LAND" IS A SMALL </p><p>CONCESSION TO MORAVIAN AND SILESIAN DESIRES FOR SOME </p><p>RECOGNITION OF THE DISTINCT HISTORICAL STATUS OF THEIR </p><p>AREAS.  IT IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT, FOR THE DRAFTERS OF </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION, THE "LANDS" TO ALL INTENTS AND </p><p>PURPOSES WILL BE ANALOGOUS TO THE ALREADY EXISTING </p><p>"REGIONS", RATHER THAN TO LARGER HISTORIC AREAS SUCH AS </p><p>MORAVIA OR SILESIA.)  THE UNITS OF TERRITORIAL </p><p>SELF-ADMINISTRATION ELECT THEIR OWN BOARDS OF </p><p>REPRESENTATIVES FOR FOUR-YEAR TERMS, AND CAN OWN </p><p>PROPERTY AND "ENGAGE IN MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO THEIR </p><p>OWN BUDGETS."  THE CONSTITUTION OTHERWISE LEAVES THE </p><p>EXACT AUTHORITY OF THE BOARDS OF REPRESENTATIVES TO BE </p><p>DEFINED BY SUBSEQUENT LAWS. </p><p> </p><p>TEMPORARY PROVISIONS AND ENTRY INTO FORCE </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>22.  THE CONSTITUTION TAKES EFFECT JANUARY 1, 1993.  ON </p><p>THAT DATE, THE CZECH NATIONAL COUNCIL, THE CURRENT </p><p>REPUBLIC PARLIAMENT, WILL BECOME THE CHAMBER OF </p><p>DEPUTIES, WITH ITS TERM TO END ON JUNE 6, 1996.  THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION STATES THAT A PROVISIONAL SENATE WILL BE </p><p>CONSTITUTED TO COVER THE PERIOD UNTIL REGULAR SENATE </p><p>ELECTIONS ARE HELD.  UNTIL A PROVISIONAL SENATE IS IN </p><p>PLACE, THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES WILL PERFORM THE </p><p>FUNCTIONS OF THE SENATE.  (NOTE: A LAW TRANSFORMING THE </p><p>CZECH DEPUTIES FROM THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY INTO A </p><p>PROVISIONAL SENATE FAILED TO PASS THE CZECH NATIONAL </p><p>COUNCIL.  A SOMEWHAT MODIFIED VERSION OF THE LAW WILL </p><p>COME UP AGAIN, BUT PERHAPS NOT UNTIL MID-JANUARY.) </p><p> </p><p>EMBASSY COMMENT </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>23.  IN ITS FUNDAMENTAL PROVISIONS, THE CZECH </p><p>CONSTITUTION CLEARLY REFLECTS THE "CIVIC PRINCIPLE" </p><p>CENTRAL TO THE IDEOLOGY OF THE CZECH GOVERNING COALITION </p><p>PARTIES, ESP. THE CIVIC DEMOCRATIC PARTY (ODS) AND THE </p><p>CIVIC DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE (ODA). .THE RIGHTS SPECIFIED </p><p>IN THE CONSTITUTION ARE THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS OF A </p><p>POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND THE RIGHTS THOSE CITIZENS DERIVE </p><p>FROM THEIR BASIC HUMANITY.  THE GOVERNING COALITION </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY RESISTED OPPOSITION EFFORTS TO INCLUDE THE </p><p>CZECHOSLOVAK CHARTER OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS </p><p>DIRECTLY IN THE CONSTITUTION, PUTTING THE CHARTER </p><p>IMPLICITLY ON A SOMEWHAT LOWER LEVEL AS PART OF THE CR\'S </p><p>"CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER."  THE CHARTER INCLUDES SOCIAL AND </p><p>ECONOMIC GUARANTEES, E.G. TO EMPLOYMENT AND PENSIONS, </p><p>VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE BASIC CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS THE </p><p>GOVERNING PARTIES FOCUS ON.  IT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT THAT </p><p>THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES THE EQUALITY OF CITIZENS AS </p><p>INDIVIDUALS, WITHOUT SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO RIGHTS OF </p><p>GROUPS SUCH AS NATIONAL OR ETHNIC MINORITIES.  THE </p><p>INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS THAT THE CONSTITUTION DOES GUARANTEE </p><p>ARE GUARANTEED UNEQUIVOCALLY, WITH NO ROOM FOR </p><p>EXCEPTION, AND PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND </p><p>REGULAR JUDICIARY.  THE CITIZEN HAS AMPLE RECOURSE </p><p>AGAINST VIOLATIONS OF HIS RIGHTS BY THE INSTRUMENTS OF </p><p>STATE POWER. </p><p> </p><p>24.  THE CZECH CONSTITUTION IS FULLY COMPARABLE TO THE </p><p>CONSTITUTIONS OF CONTINENTAL WEST EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>DEMOCRACIES, AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE 1920 CONSTITUTION </p><p>OF DEMOCRATIC CZECHOSLOVAKIA IS EVIDENT.  THE POWERS OF </p><p>THE PRESIDENT MAY BE SLIGHTLY GREATER THAN THE CURRENT </p><p>WEST EUROPEAN AVERAGE, REFLECTING BOTH THE TRADITION OF </p><p>FIRST REPUBLIC CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND THE EFFORTS OF VACLAV </p><p>HAVEL TO ENSURE THAT THE OFFICE HE HOPES TO HOLD WILL BE </p><p>GENUINELY SUBSTANTIVE.  (CZECH PRIME MINISTER KLAUS, A </p><p>STRONG ADVOCATE OF THE PARTY-BASED PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT, WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A SOMEWHAT WEAKER </p><p>PRESIDENCY, BUT HAS LITTLE REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED.) </p><p> </p><p>25.  THE ONLY VISIBLE CONCESSION TO THE DEMANDS OF THE </p><p>MORAVIAN AND SILESIAN AUTONOMISTS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>USE THE TERM "LAND" (ZEME) FOR THE HIGHER UNITS OF </p><p>TERRITORIAL SELF-ADMINISTRATION, AND THE RIGHT FOR THE </p><p>BOARDS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THOSE HIGHER UNITS TO </p><p>PROPOSE LEGISLATION TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  THIS </p><p>FALLS FAR SHORT OF WHAT THE MORAVIANS HOPED FOR. </p><p>CONCESSIONS TO THE GREENS WERE SIMILARLY MODEST. </p><p>ARTICLE 7 ONLY REQUIRES THE STATE TO "SEE TO THE </p><p>CAUTIOUS USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND TO THE PROTECTION </p><p>OF NATURAL WEALTH."  THE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT A </p><p>SUBSEQUENT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CAN ESTABLISH WHEN THE </p><p>PEOPLE MAY EXERCISE STATE POWER DIRECTLY, I.E. BY MEANS </p><p>OF A REFERENDUM, BUT THIS DOES NOT GO NEARLY AS FAR AS </p><p>THE DEMOCRATIC LEFT OPPOSITION HAD HOPED. </p><p> </p><p>26.  IN SUM, THE CZECH GOVERNING PARTIES HAVE REASON TO </p><p>BE QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE CONSTITUTION.  THE SAME </p><p>SHOULD BE TRUE FOR THE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES.  THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION APPEARS TO US TO INCLUDE ALL THE NECESSARY </p><p>GUARANTEES OF POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND OF CIVIL AND HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS.  ALSO, WHILE THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT REFER </p><p>SPECIFICALLY TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, IT IS CLEARLY THE </p><p>PRODUCT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DEVOTED TO FREE-MARKET </p><p>PRINCIPLES AND DO NOT WANT TO CONDITION PEOPLE\'S </p><p>ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR AND LIMIT OPPORTUNITIES BY </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL MEANS. </p><p> </p><p>BASORA </p><p></p></div>
