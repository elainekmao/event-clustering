(SBU) Summary: The Appeals Chamber of the International </p><p>Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) confirmed </p><p>on June 5 that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over indictee </p><p>Dragan Nikolic, who has claimed since his arrest in April </p><p>2000 to have been detained unlawfully by SFOR (refs A and B). </p><p> In its opinion, the Tribunal recognized that cross-border </p><p>apprehensions of alleged war criminals without the consent of </p><p>the host state may be acceptable (at least relative to ICTY </p><p>jurisdiction), "particularly when the intrusion occurs in </p><p>default of the State\'s cooperation."  While this ruling </p><p>provides greater latitude for persons-indicted-for-war-crimes </p><p>(PIFWC) apprehension efforts, it also places a marker that </p><p>the Court will continue to carefully review allegations "that </p><p>the rights of the accused were egregiously violated in the </p><p>process of his arrest."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) In April 2000, SFOR apprehended Dragan Nikolic, </p><p>indicted for crimes against humanity and war crimes for his </p><p>role as commander of the Susica detention camp in </p><p>Northeastern Bosnia (ref a).  Nikolic\'s counsel claimed that </p><p>he was forcibly and illegally abducted from his home in </p><p>Serbia. For the limited purpose of resolving whether the </p><p>circumstances of his arrest could divest the ICTY of </p><p>jurisdiction, the Prosecution and Defense agreed to a </p><p>stipulated set of facts suggesting that Nikolic\'s </p><p>apprehension was forcible and, in some respects, harsh.  The </p><p>trial chamber noted that the Prosecution and Defense agreed </p><p>"at least" that the accused was forcibly taken from his home </p><p>in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) by unknown </p><p>individuals having no connection with SFOR or the Tribunal. </p><p>Further, Nikolic asserted that he was transported to Bosnia </p><p>in handcuffs in the trunk of a car.  The court did not </p><p>question those facts and sought no testimony as proof of </p><p>them.  Last October, the trial chamber rejected the defense\'s </p><p>main claims that the ICTY lacked jurisdiction because, one, </p><p>Nikolic\'s abduction from Serbia was a violation of FRY </p><p>sovereignty, and two, he was mistreated during the arrest and </p><p>initial detention (ref B).  The appeals chamber upheld the </p><p>trial chamber decision. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Two aspects of the opinion are noteworthy.  First, </p><p>after finding support that state courts are likely to place </p><p>great weight on the nature of the offense at issue when </p><p>cross-border apprehensions are challenged, the appeals </p><p>chamber notes that "the damage caused to international </p><p>justice by not apprehending fugitives accused of serious </p><p>violations of international humanitarian law is comparatively </p><p>higher than the injury, if any, caused to the sovereignty of </p><p>a State by a limited intrusion in its territory, particularly </p><p>when the intrusion occurs in default of the State\'s </p><p>cooperation."  In a forward-leaning statement of ICTY </p><p>judicial policy, the Appeals Chamber says that it "does not </p><p>consider that in cases of universally condemned offences </p><p>(i.e., genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes), </p><p>jurisdiction should be set aside on the ground that there was </p><p>a violation of the sovereignty of a State, when the violation </p><p>is brought about by the apprehension of fugitives from </p><p>international justice, whatever the consequences for the </p><p>international responsibility of the State or organization </p><p>involved."  Further, "the exercise of jurisdiction should not </p><p>be declined in cases of abductions carried out by private </p><p>individuals whose actions, unless instigated, acknowledged or </p><p>condoned by a State, or an international organization, or </p><p>other entity, do not necessarily in themselves violate State </p><p>sovereignty."  Even assuming intrusive action by the captors </p><p>that could be attributed to SFOR, the chamber found "no </p><p>basis, in the present case, upon which jurisdiction should </p><p>not be exercised." </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Second, it is clear that the Tribunal -- especially </p><p>absent stipulated facts as in this case -- will review </p><p>allegations of mistreatment during apprehension and </p><p>detention.  This could involve requests to hear testimony of </p><p>or obtain statements from those involved in apprehensions, a </p><p>risk that is significantly increased when the Office of the </p><p>Prosecutor (OTP) has been involved closely in those efforts. </p><p>At the same time, however, the decision suggests strongly </p><p>that an accused must show a very high level of abuse in order </p><p>to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.  The trial chamber </p><p>had noted that "in a situation where an accused is very </p><p>seriously mistreated, maybe even subjected to inhuman, cruel </p><p>or degrading treatment, or torture, before being handed over </p><p>to the Tribunal, this may constitute a legal impediment to </p><p>the exercise of jurisdiction over such an accused."  The </p><p>appeals chamber cited this language approvingly, though it </p><p>may have sown some confusion by suggesting that the standard </p><p>is whether "the rights of the accused were egregiously </p><p>violated in the process of his arrest."  Whether there is any </p><p>light between "very seriously mistreated" and "egregiously </p><p>violated," the clear conclusion that may be drawn is that, </p><p>except in very grave cases of mistreatment, the Tribunal is </p><p>unlikely to divest itself of jurisdiction over an accused. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) That said, the appeals chamber hints that in a case </p><p>where the mistreatment of an accused or violation of state </p><p>sovereignty reaches a very high degree of seriousness, it </p><p>will "determine whether the underlying violations are </p><p>attributable to SFOR and by extension to the OTP."  In other </p><p>words, even if the misconduct is carried out by persons other </p><p>than SFOR/KFOR or OTP, the Tribunal may look to determine </p><p>whether that misconduct is attributable first to SFOR or KFOR </p><p>and second to OTP and could therefore deprive the ICTY of </p><p>jurisdiction.  Neither the appeals nor trial chambers found </p><p>it necessary to address when such attribution would be </p><p>possible, but the trial chamber\'s more expansive opinion </p><p>leaves open the possibility that SFOR or KFOR involvement in </p><p>an unlawful apprehension or detention -- such as procuring </p><p>others\' illegal actions or carrying them out directly -- </p><p>could bring into question the Tribunal\'s jurisdiction. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Comment: The appeals chamber has handed OTP and SFOR </p><p>an important victory that closes the chapter on Nikolic\'s </p><p>apprehension.  Perhaps more important, however, it highlights </p><p>the importance the chambers attach to apprehensions of PIFWCs </p><p>-- essentially, it says that the importance of apprehensions </p><p>trumps state sovereignty concerns.  This is a remarkable </p><p>statement for the Tribunal to make and may be seen as a green </p><p>light for the international community to take aggressive </p><p>action to capture fugitives.  (NB: The tone and substance </p><p>echo comments Embassy legal officers have heard directly from </p><p>President Theodor Meron (American), who signed the opinion.) </p><p>There is a caveat, of course; a complaint by a state </p><p>concerned could weigh against the legitimacy of a </p><p>cross-border apprehension.  But even in such a situation the </p><p>Tribunal suggests that the value of international justice is </p><p>more important than such a limited injury to state </p><p>sovereignty.  We also see this statement of the chamber as </p><p>another signal of cooperation issues moving into the judicial </p><p>sphere (ref c). </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment, cont\'d: It should also be recognized that the </p><p>Tribunal keeps open the possibility that indictees in custody </p><p>may challenge the means by which they were apprehended and, </p><p>in the most serious cases, potentially gain release.  We </p><p>suspect that few cases, if any, will lead a chamber to find </p><p>that it lacks jurisdiction over an accused.  However, in </p><p>cases where OTP and the defense cannot agree to stipulated </p><p>facts (as they did here), trial chambers dealing with </p><p>challenges to the circumstances of an arrest are likely to </p><p>feel it necessary to explore the details of apprehensions. </p><p>In such cases, the more the apprehension effort is </p><p>intertwined with the OTP, the greater the risk that </p><p>apprehension forces may be asked to explain to the court the </p><p>circumstances of the arrest.  End comment. </p><p>SOBEL </p><p></p></div>
