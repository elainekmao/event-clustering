<p>UNCLAS VATICAN 006026 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT. FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI), EUR/PD/PA (HILTON) </p><p> </p><p>FROM EMBASSY VATICAN MESSAGE NUMBER 204/01 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PINR, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: AGE PREVENTS POPE TRAVELING TO OCEANIA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   POPE JOHN PAUL II\'S INCREASING INFIRMITY HAS PREVENTED </p><p>HIM TRAVELING TO OCEANIA TO PROMULGATE A NEW CHURCH DOCUMENT </p><p>FOR THE REGION. THE VATICAN CITED DISTANCE AND THE EFFECT OF </p><p>THE FLIGHT ON THE POPE\'S HEALTH AS THE REASONS FOR ISSUING THE </p><p>DOCUMENT IN ROME, NOVEMBER 22, VIA INTERNET (A FIRST FOR THE </p><p>VATICAN). IN THE RECENT PAST, THE POPE HAS CONDUCTED THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  06026  231203Z </p><p>PRESENTATION CEREMONIES IN THE REGIONS THAT WERE THE SUBJECT </p><p>OF PREVIOUS DOCUMENTS: THE AMERICAS, AFRICA, EUROPE AND ASIA. </p><p> </p><p>2.   POPE JOHN PAUL II IS 81. HE IS BECOMING FRAILER WITH EACH </p><p>PASSING YEAR. IT IS NO SECRET THAT THE POPE SUFFERS FROM A </p><p>NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, PROBABLY PARKINSON\'S. THE VATICAN HAS </p><p>INSTITUTED VARIOUS PROCEDURES AND TOOLS TO MAKE LIFE EASIER </p><p>FOR THE PONTIFF - A SPECIAL LECTERN ON HIS CHAIR FOR THE PAGES </p><p>OF HIS SPEECHES BECAUSE TREMORS PRECLUDE HIM HOLDING THE TEXT; </p><p>A WHEELED PLATFORM TO MOVE HIM UP THE AISLE OF SAINT PETER\'S </p><p>BASILICA. (THE AISLE IS 211 METERS LONG). POPE JOHN PAUL NOW </p><p>WEARS A HEARING AID, ALTHOUGH HE DOES NOT REQUIRE SPECTACLES </p><p>TO READ, AND OFTEN USES A CANE WHEN WALKING. </p><p> </p><p>3.   COMMENT: THE VATICAN IS ADAPTING ITSELF TO THE NEEDS OF </p><p>THE AGING AND INCREASINGLY FRAIL POPE. THE PONTIFF INSISTS ON </p><p>PERFORMING AS MANY OF HIS DUTIES AS POSSIBLE. ALTHOUGH HIS </p><p>SCHEDULE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THE ESSENTIAL, IT WOULD BE </p><p>DEMANDING FOR ANY OCTOGENARIAN. WHILE THE POPE\'S BODY MAY BE </p><p>SLOWING DOWN, ALL THOSE WHO MEET WITH THE POPE SAY HIS MIND </p><p>REMAINS ACTIVE AND ALERT. THE VATICAN WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>ACCOMMODATE THE AGING PONTIFF SO THAT THE DIGNITY AND MORE </p><p>IMPORTANTLY, THE PUBLIC NATURE OF THE OFFICE IS MAINTAINED FOR </p><p>AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. END COMMENT. NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA06026 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
