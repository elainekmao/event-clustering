<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000312 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/20/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PGOV, NP, Political Parties, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS MEET MAINSTREAM PARTY LEADERS IN </p><p>KATHMANDU </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) KATHMANDU 0292 </p><p>     B. (B) KATHMANDU 0262 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Two members of the Maoist Central Committee have </p><p>been meeting individual leaders of mainstream political </p><p>parties in Kathmandu over the past few days to seek their </p><p>support before negotiations with the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON).  Party sources contacted have been noncommittal about </p><p>the tenor of the meetings and continue to express skepticism </p><p>of the Maoists\' true aims.  Narayan Singh Pun, Minister for </p><p>Physical Planning and the GON\'s point man for communicating </p><p>with the Maoists, told the Ambassador that he believes that </p><p>international pressure was crucial in persuading the Maoists </p><p>to agree to a ceasefire and contemplate formal peace </p><p>negotiations.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>MAOISTS MEET PARTY LEADERS IN OPEN </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  The local press has reported that Maoist Central </p><p>Committee members Krishna Mahara and Dinanath Sharma have </p><p>been holding a series of individual meetings with mainstream </p><p>party leaders in Kathmandu since February 18.  The pair also </p><p>reportedly met with Padma Ratna Tuladhar, a putative human </p><p>rights activist with close and long-standing covert links to </p><p>the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Nepali Congress (NC) General Secretary Sushil </p><p>Koirala confirmed that NC President G.P. Koirala had met the </p><p>pair on Feb. 18.  He characterized the meeting as a first </p><p>attempt by the Maoists to establish pre-dialogue lines of </p><p>communication with the party.  The NC continues to insist </p><p>that Parliament must be reinstated as a first step toward any </p><p>resolution of the "current crisis." Koirala was unable or </p><p>unwilling to characterize any Maoist response to this </p><p>position. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  According to Communist Party of Nepal - United </p><p>Marxist-Leninist (UML) Central Committee Member Bharat Mohan </p><p>Adhikari, the two Maoists met with UML leader Madhav Kumar </p><p>Nepal on Feb. 18 as well.  Adhikari characterized the meeting </p><p>as "interesting and useful," but added that it produced </p><p>"nothing concrete" regarding Maoist demands or intentions. </p><p>The pair had claimed to Nepal that the Maoists are not </p><p>against multiparty democracy and realize that the parties </p><p>must be included in a successful negotiation process.  The </p><p>Maoists want to have good relations with all the parties, </p><p>they stated.  This first meeting they described as an </p><p>"opening" toward dialogue with the parties.  The Maoists are </p><p>not ignoring the parties by dealing with the Government of </p><p>Nepal (GON), they emphasized; hence their desire to meet </p><p>party leaders before sitting down formally with the GON.  The </p><p>two reportedly told the UML leader that "progess with the </p><p>government is not running smoothly," but added that the </p><p>insurgents will soon meet with the GON regarding a code of </p><p>conduct for the ceasefire. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  Adhikari said Nepal, in response to the pair\'s </p><p>assertions about wanting good relations with the parties, </p><p>complained about Maoist killings of UML activists, especially </p><p>during the past year.  The Maoists disingenuously disputed </p><p>that their cadre had been killing UML members, and proposed </p><p>setting up a "commission" to "inquire" into the incidents. </p><p>The Maoists implied during the meeting that they no longer </p><p>oppose the constitutional monarchy, Adhikari observed, </p><p>although he cautioned that they did not say so explicitly. </p><p>The Maoists also said nothing about whether they will insist </p><p>on dealing with an all-party government instead of the </p><p>current interim government appointed by the King, Adhikari </p><p>reported, although such comments have been attributed to them </p><p>in the media. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  In the UML view, the party "cannot rely too much" on </p><p>the Maoists\' newly expressed support for multiparty democracy </p><p>since their actions belie those claims.  The party continues </p><p>to be suspicious of the insurgents\' true aims in seeking </p><p>dialouge, Adhikari stated, adding that any sincere effort </p><p>toward dialogue must include the parties\' participation. </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE KEY TO CEASEFIRE </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Narayan Singh Pun, Physical Planning Minister and </p><p>GON point man for dealing with the Maoists, confirmed to the </p><p>Ambassador Feb. 20 that he had "flown in" four Maoist leaders </p><p>to Kathmandu on his helicopter.  (Note:  A former Army pilot, </p><p>Pun now owns a private helicopter company.  End note.)  Pun </p><p>cited four factors that he believes motivated the Maoists to </p><p>agree to a ceasefire and consider negotiations.  First, the </p><p>counterinsurgency capability of the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) </p><p>has improved over the past year, resulting in a "balanced </p><p>situation" between the sides.  Second, international support </p><p>for the GON (including USG security assistance and the </p><p>possibility that the USG might place the Maoists on a </p><p>terrorist list) had weakened the Maoists\' position.  Third, </p><p>India had stepped up pressure on Maoists crossing its borders </p><p>and residing in its territory.  Fourth, the Maoists are </p><p>experiencing significant difficulty in procuring new </p><p>recruits, supplies, equipment, ammunition and food. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The UML is prudent in suspecting the depth of the </p><p>Maoists\' near-overnight conversion to the virtues of </p><p>multiparty democracy; we have some of the same reservations. </p><p>That said, the Maoists are meeting with the parties, even if </p><p>only to offer perfunctory lip service to democracy.  Based on </p><p>what we have heard, the meetings seem short on substance, but </p><p>may nonetheless salve the wounded pride of political leaders </p><p>who feel increasingly left out in the cold by the Palace. </p><p>While the political leaders may suspect the Maoists\' motives, </p><p>they will certainly welcome their attention and seek to keep </p><p>open channels of communication.  This could serve to muddy </p><p>already murky waters for the Palace, which prides itself on </p><p>maintaining a single line of contact with the Maoist </p><p>leadership.  The Palace, which also has frequently expressed </p><p>its support for multiparty democracy, would be well advised </p><p>to open more active dialogue with the major parties before </p><p>sitting down to talks with the Maoists. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
