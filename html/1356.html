(C) THE GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED "THE HERALD" </p><p>NEWSPAPER\'S NOVEMBER 21 EDITION REPORTED THAT HIGH COURT </p><p>JUDGE PRESIDENT JUSTICE GODFREY CHIDYASIKU ISSUED A </p><p>PROVISIONAL ORDER IN CHAMBERS NOVEMBER 20 WHICH SOUGHT </p><p>TO PREVENT THE GOVERNMENT FROM EXPELLING "RESETTLED </p><p>FARMERS," IN ACCORDANCE WITH A SUPREME COURT CONSENT </p><p>ORDER (REFTEL).  FOLLOWING AN APPLICATION BY THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION, THE SUPREME COURT ISSUED A </p><p>CONSENT ORDER ON NOVEMBER 10 FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>FOLLOW ALL NECESSARY LEGAL REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF THE </p><p>LAND ACQUISITION ACT BEFORE RESETTLING PEOPLE.  ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 20 THE HIGH COURT GRANTED ONE SAMSON MHURIRO </p><p>PERMISSION TO REPRESENT RURAL PEASANT FARMERS ON ALL </p><p>OCCUPIED FARMS IN A CONSTITUTIONAL APPLICATION, IN TERMS </p><p>OF THE CLASS ACTION ACT AND GAVE HIM FIFTEEN DAYS TO DO </p><p>SO.  THE GOVERNMENT, CFU AND THE POLICE, WHO WERE CITED </p><p>AS RESPONDENTS, WERE GIVEN TEN DAYS TO OPPOSE THE </p><p>PROVISIONAL ORDER.  IF THEY FAIL TO DO SO, THE ORDER </p><p>WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CONFIRMED.  MHURIRO, WHO WAS </p><p>RESETTLED AT VICTORY FARM IN MASHONALAND EAST IN 1998, </p><p>FILED HIS APPLICATION LAST WEEK FOR LEAVE TO SEEK A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06547  211631Z </p><p>REVIEW, SCRAPPING AND OR VARIATION OF THE SUPREME COURT </p><p>ORDER.  HE ALLEGED THAT UP TO 26,000 FAMILIES CURRENTLY </p><p>ON FARMS WOULD BE AFFECTED BY EVICTIONS, AS THEY HAVE NO </p><p>PLACE TO GO.  MHURIRO FURTHER STATED THAT HE BELIEVED </p><p>THEIR RESETTLEMENT WAS DONE IN TERMS OF THE LAW, AND WAS </p><p>CONSTITUTIONALLY ENTITLED TO SECURE PROTECTION OF THE </p><p>LAW, AS HE WAS NOT PARTY TO THE SUPREME COURT ORDER. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CONTACTED FOR COMMENT ON NOVEMBER 21, THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (FU) VICE PRESIDENT FOR </p><p>REGIONS, WILLIAM HUGHES, SAID HIS ORGANIZATION COULD NOT </p><p>UNDERSTAND HOW THE HIGH COURT CAN OVERRULE THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT.  OUR LEGAL ADVISOR, ROBERT STUMBLES, TELLS US </p><p>THAT ALTHOUGH LOWER COURTS HAVE RESPECT FOR HIGHER COURT </p><p>JUDGMENTS AND SUPREME COURT RULINGS ARE BINDING ON LOWER </p><p>COURTS, A LOWER COURT JUDGE CAN DISTINGUISH A CASE </p><p>BEFORE HIM AS BEING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE INTENT </p><p>OF A PARTICULAR SUPREME COURT RULING.  IT APPEARS TO </p><p>HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS CASE, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS UNCLEAR </p><p>WHETHER CHIDYAUSIKU HAS THE AUTHORITY TO STOP </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSENT ORDER BASED ON A CASE THAT </p><p>OCCURRED TWO YEARS PRIOR TO THE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES </p><p>THAT SPARKED THE SUPREME COURT RULING IN THE FIRST </p><p>PLACE.  THE CFU VICE PRESIDENT SAID HIS LAWYERS WOULD BE </p><p>LOOKING INTO THE CASE.  THEY HAVE LEARNED THAT JUSTICE </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU WOULD CLARIFY THE SITUATION SHORTLY, BUT IN </p><p>THE EVENT CHIDYAUSIKU DOES NOT WITHDRAW HIS ORDER ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 22, THEY WILL PREPARE A LEGAL RESPONSE. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: TO US THIS APPEARS LIKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT </p><p>BY THE GOVERNMENT TO DISCREDIT THE JUDICIARY.  SUPREME </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06547  211631Z </p><p>COURT CHIEF JUSTICE, WHO ISSUED THE CONSENT ORDER ON </p><p>NOVEMBER 10, IS WHITE AND RECENTLY HAS BEEN VILIFIED BY </p><p>THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT FOR BEING A BRITISH PAWN.  JUSTICE </p><p>CHIDYAUSIKU IS WIDELY KNOWN TO BE A ZANU-PF SYMPATHIZER </p><p>AND ALREADY HAS TAKEN ACTIONS TO THWART THE OPPOSITION, </p><p>FOR EXAMPLE, DELAYING THE CONSIDERATION OF URGENT </p><p>APPLICATIONS BY THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE TO </p><p>OVERTURN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION RESULTS IN VARIOUS </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES CHARACTERIZED BY INTIMIDATION OR RIGGING. </p><p>IF CHIDYAUSIKU STANDS BY HIS RULING, THE CFU, THE MOST </p><p>AFFECTED PARTY, COULD WELL APPEAL IT TO THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT, A FACT THAT WILL DELAY THE RESTORATION OF THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW TO THE COMMERCIAL FARMS. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
