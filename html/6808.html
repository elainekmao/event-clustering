<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 001964 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, KWMN, SMIG, KFRD, PREF, ELAB, TU, TIP IN TURKEY </p><p>SUBJECT: GOT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR 2003 TIP </p><p>REPORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. (A) ANKARA 1396 </p><p>     B. (B) BOILER-LERNER 3/24 FAX </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Action request--para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. March 24 MFA DDG for Consular Affairs Firat Topcuoglu </p><p>provided us additional information for 2003 TIP report: (1) </p><p>GOT TIP National Action Plan (NAP) and (2) GOT responses to </p><p>TIP-related questions from post (ref B).  Both have been sent </p><p>ref (B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. Under the impact of her attendance at G/TIP-sponsored </p><p>conference in Washington in February 2003, Topcuoglu said the </p><p>entertainment and transportation sectors are key areas for </p><p>future GOT anti-trafficking initiatives.  Her office has </p><p>asked for preliminary data from a survey recently sent to all </p><p>prosecutors and courts regarding prosecutions under new </p><p>anti-TIP legislation passed in August 2002.  While she does </p><p>not expect many cases have been opened yet, she hopes the USG </p><p>will recognize the acceleration of efforts in this regard, </p><p>since normally such statistics would not have been available </p><p>before summer.  Estimating that the statistics may be </p><p>available at the end of April, she requested a firm deadline </p><p>from Washington for submission in order to make the 2003 </p><p>report. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The Turkish NAP entered into effect March 6.  It </p><p>emphasizes inter-agency coordination and highlights victim </p><p>services.  It calls for the establishment of shelters, safe </p><p>return of victims, establishment of emergency TIP hot-lines </p><p>for victims, protection of witnesses or victims during court </p><p>cases, treatment and rehabilitation of victims, establishment </p><p>of a fund to help aid victims, and the launch of an awareness </p><p>campaign.  It further stresses governmental initiatives aimed </p><p>to reduce TIP and prosecute and punish TIP organizers.  These </p><p>actions include the centralization of the issuance of work </p><p>permits in the Ministry of Labor, improved participation of </p><p>key law enforcement personnel in TIP training seminars, </p><p>amendment to marriage and citizenship laws to hinder fake </p><p>marriages, an increase in anti-TIP NGOs, and compilation of </p><p>statistics related to TIP crimes by MOJ.  Topcuoglu </p><p>highlighted three NGOs in Bursa, Istanbul, and Ankara trying </p><p>to open shelters for women seeking to escape the sex trade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Topcuoglu indicated two GOT initiatives that resulted from </p><p>conversations with regional colleagues during the February </p><p>2003 G/TIP-sponsored conference in Washington: taking </p><p>preventative measures in the entertainment sector and working </p><p>with transportation officials to identify potential victims </p><p>and traffickers en route to Turkey.  Conversations with </p><p>Ukrainian, Moldovan, Georgian, Romanian, and Slovenian </p><p>participants strengthened GOT resolve to raise work standards </p><p>for the entertainment sector.  Topcuoglu said she is also </p><p>going to pursue talks with the Ministry of Transportation </p><p>regarding holding bus companies accountable for knowing who </p><p>their passengers are on routes between Georgia and Turkey and </p><p>Azerbaijan and Turkey.  (Comment: While these initiatives are </p><p>in the planning stages, they highlight Topcuoglu\'s </p><p>commitment, as TIP coordinator, to think beyond the normally </p><p>narrow GOT bureaucratic approach.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. Action request: Department to provide firm date to GOT on </p><p>when 2002 statistical data regarding TIP and TIP-related </p><p>crimes must be provided in order to be considered for </p><p>inclusion in this year\'s TIP report. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
