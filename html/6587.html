<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000579 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AID/W FOR AFR/SD/HRD, G/PHN/DAA, G/PHN/POP, </p><p>G/PHN/HN, G/PHN/HN/HIV, G/PHN/HN/HPSR, </p><p>G/PHN/HN/EH, G/PHN/HN/CS </p><p>AFR/SA, MARJORIE COPSON, VERNITA FORT </p><p>State/AF, MIKE RAYNOR </p><p> </p><p>MISSIONS FOR: PHN OFFICERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KHIV, ZI, HIV/AIDS </p><p>SUBJECT:  HIV/AIDS MESSAGES REACH MILLIONS OF </p><p>YOUTH </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary:  USAID/Zimbabwe is making creative </p><p>use of television to reach millions of youth </p><p>with HIV/AIDS messages.  Adolescence is a period </p><p>of dynamic change and although many youth are </p><p>healthy, they face the risks of unwanted </p><p>pregnancies, HIV/AIDS and other sexually </p><p>transmitted diseases. In Zimbabwe, as elsewhere </p><p>in Africa, more than 50% of all new HIV </p><p>infections occur in young people under the age </p><p>of 25. As part of USAID/Zimbabwe\'s overall </p><p>effort to address this problem, we recently </p><p>launched a TV soap opera and a TV talk show that </p><p>are entertaining young viewers while </p><p>simultaneously educating them about HIV/AIDS and </p><p>delivering strong behavior change messages. The </p><p>soap opera, named Studio 263, has quickly become </p><p>the number one TV show in the country.  The two </p><p>shows offer a broad range of HIV/AIDS prevention </p><p>messages with the long format allowing for more </p><p>in-depth treatment of such nuanced subjects as </p><p>abstinence. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. In September 2002, USAID/Zimbabwe launched a </p><p>TV soap opera, named Studio 263 after Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>international dialing code, that airs in half- </p><p>hour episodes three times a week.  The show </p><p>deals with day-to-day issues confronting young </p><p>Zimbabweans. It provides choices, solutions and </p><p>ideas that help young people think about the </p><p>future they want for themselves. </p><p> </p><p>3. Studio 263 is the story of Vimbayi, a </p><p>beautiful young woman from a lower-middle-class, </p><p>high-density suburb of Harare.  After winning </p><p>the Miss Harare beauty pageant, Vimbayi decides </p><p>to go for the prestigious Miss Zimbabwe pageant. </p><p>Financially constrained, she meets a rich young </p><p>man who offers to help her. She becomes pregnant </p><p>just before the contest and loses the </p><p>opportunity to realize her dream. With the man </p><p>refusing to accept the child, she decides to </p><p>take control of her life, completes her </p><p>education and finds a good job. Trying to manage </p><p>her own family as well as help her parents, </p><p>Vimbayi goes on to become a successful, married </p><p>career woman. Her relentless struggle to </p><p>overcome various obstacles at home and work, </p><p>while dealing with relationships with </p><p>boyfriends, family members and friends, and her </p><p>eventual emergence as a confident, woman of </p><p>substance, become the main focus of the story. </p><p> </p><p>4. A variety of evolving situations and </p><p>circumstances are threaded through different </p><p>characters and relationships surrounding </p><p>Vimbayi, her life, her ambition, dreams and </p><p>career.  These stories are designed to help </p><p>Zimbabwean youth understand the risks associated </p><p>with early sexual activity, especially HIV/AIDS </p><p>and unwanted pregnancy.  The program educates </p><p>youth on the choices available to them in </p><p>overcoming such risks.  It provides social </p><p>support for the choice of delayed sexual </p><p>activity and living a healthy life.  By offering </p><p>role models that young people can emulate, the </p><p>serial drama aims at improving the physical, </p><p>mental and social well-being of Zimbabwean </p><p>youth. </p><p> </p><p>5. When it was launched in September 2002, 1.6 </p><p>million viewers tuned into the first episode of </p><p>Studio 263, making it the second most widely </p><p>viewed program on television, after the 8 p.m. </p><p>news.  Since the beginning of the year, the </p><p>number of viewers has grown rapidly to 2 million </p><p>per episode, making Studio 263 the most popular </p><p>show ever on Zimbabwean TV.  While young adults </p><p>remain the core audience, the program also </p><p>attracts older family members with its social </p><p>relevance and family appeal. "Studio 263 has </p><p>become a cult," says a professor from the </p><p>University of Zimbabwe. A twenty-year old woman </p><p>in Chegutu reveals, "Vimbayi, Beverley, Jabu, </p><p>James, and Tendai - they are all household names </p><p>today. We look at ourselves through them. If </p><p>anything happens to Vimbayi, I feel as if it\'s </p><p>happening to me. It\'s so real. I love it." </p><p> </p><p>6. While Studio 263 connects with the youth </p><p>through its emotional drama and identifiable </p><p>characters, This is Life is an edu-taining talk- </p><p>show of one hour duration, aimed at generating </p><p>debate and discussion in Zimbabwean society by </p><p>providing more detailed information on HIV/AIDS- </p><p>related issues in an interactive, informed </p><p>manner. Topics are chosen for their relevance to </p><p>youth.  They are discussed at length under the </p><p>guidance of experts with both a studio audience </p><p>and people on the street. The show is co-hosted </p><p>by two well-known Zimbabwean presenters. </p><p> </p><p>7. Launched in June 2002, This is Life commands </p><p>a viewership of more than 1.5 million young </p><p>people per episode. Popular for its frank, bold </p><p>approach and treatment, This is Life deals with </p><p>some of the most difficult issues surrounding </p><p>HIV/AIDS prevention: abstinence -- and </p><p>strategies for achieving it; fidelity; the risks </p><p>of serial monogamy - a common characteristic </p><p>among youth; the trusted-partner myth; condom </p><p>efficacy; alcohol, sex and HIV; money, sex and </p><p>HIV; living positively with HIV -- providing </p><p>support encouragement and information; stigma </p><p>and discrimination; teenage pregnancy; rape; </p><p>children affected by AIDS; and the scapecoat of </p><p>"African culture" as an excuse for sexual </p><p>promiscuity. </p><p> </p><p>8. Both Studio 263 and This is Life are scripted, </p><p>directed and produced by Zimbabweans with oversight </p><p>from USAID\'s contractor, Population Services </p><p>International (PSI), for message content and </p><p>quality. Studio 263 and This is Life, together with </p><p>a CDC/Zimbabwe-sponsored radio serial drama (Mopani </p><p>Junction), have set a new direction for HIV </p><p>prevention communications in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
