<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002022 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WSSD; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Following are excerpts of editorials carried in </p><p>      the September 4 editions of the independent daily "The </p><p>      Daily News" and the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>      Herald" on Robert Mugabe\'s speech to the WSSD: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   Under headline "As millions face starvation, </p><p>      Mugabe scolds Tony Blair," the "Daily News" (09/04) </p><p>      comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "Zimbabweans will have reacted differently to </p><p>      President Mugabe\'s emotional address to the WSSD </p><p>      in Johannesburg on Monday.  Some will praise it </p><p>      for its blunt warning to the British Prime </p><p>      Minister, Tony Blair, to stop what Mugabe </p><p>      believes is his interference in Zimbabwean </p><p>      politics. . .  Others will rank it as a rather </p><p>      unfortunate speech which did not address the </p><p>      nitty-gritty issue of the summit\'s agenda - </p><p>      sustainable development.  They will regret </p><p>      Mugabe\'s preoccupation with Tony Blair to the </p><p>      exclusion of the number one subject among the </p><p>      people today - starvation. . .  So, while it may </p><p>      be possible that there are those who feel the </p><p>      President\'s speech to the Earth Summit hit the </p><p>      right note, there may be others who feel </p><p>      strongly that by taking his brawl with Tony </p><p>      Blair to such a world forum, Mugabe did not </p><p>      enhance his international reputation one whit. </p><p>      Certainly, they would not feel that the speech </p><p>      would do much to help the six million people </p><p>      threatened with starvation.  They would counsel </p><p>      against the confrontational stance of the </p><p>      government, while the country is in such dire </p><p>      need of food aid." </p><p> </p><p>  3.   Under headline "President\'s speech should </p><p>      invigorate us" the government-controlled daily "The </p><p>      Herald" (09/04) comments: </p><p> </p><p>      "President Mugabe\'s speech at the WSSD on Monday </p><p>      has been hailed by most well-meaning people </p><p>      throughout the world for speaking on behalf of </p><p>      the poor.  The thunderous applause he got during </p><p>      and after his address said it all.  This was </p><p>      probably his finest moment in history as he </p><p>      hogged international limelight on all major </p><p>      television networks, newspapers, radio talk </p><p>      shows and news agency reports.  In just 10 </p><p>      minutes he had devastated the entire Western </p><p>      coalition against Zimbabwe and given the Third </p><p>      World a new voice to speak with boldness against </p><p>      neo-colonialism being brought in the name of </p><p>      globalization and democracy. . . Although he did </p><p>      not insult anyone, British Prime Minister Tony </p><p>      Blair particularly felt the sting of his candid </p><p>      speech. . .  What the speech has achieved more </p><p>      than anything else is the message that firstly, </p><p>      Zimbabwe is a truly free country and will die </p><p>      protecting its sovereignty.  Secondly, the land </p><p>      reform program is here to stay.  This is the </p><p>      message the world needed to hear. . . </p><p>      Zimbabweans should find new vigor and strength </p><p>      from the President\'s boldness and forthrightness </p><p>      to push on the land agenda and support this </p><p>      courage by making the agrarian reforms a </p><p>      success. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
