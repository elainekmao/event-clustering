<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 001775 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR/WE MENNUTI, WHA/CCA, AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/28/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, CU, VT </p><p>SUBJECT: POPE DECRIES EXECUTIONS AND ASKS CASTRO FOR </p><p>CLEMENCY FOR DISSIDENTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) VATICAN 1406 </p><p>     B. B) VATICAN 1401 </p><p>     C. C) VATICAN 1137 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON.  REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) SEE ACTION REQUEST PARA. 5. </p><p> </p><p>    2.  (U) IN A DEPARTURE FROM THE HOLY SEE\'S NORMALLY CAUTIOUS </p><p>APPROACH TO CUBA, POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS PUBLICLY DECRIED THE </p><p>EXECUTION OF THREE HIJACKERS AS WELL AS THE HARSH SENTENCES </p><p>RECENTLY HANDED DOWN AGAINST CUBAN DISSIDENTS.  THE POPE\'S </p><p>APRIL 13 APPEAL, WRITTEN ON HIS BEHALF BY SECRETARY OF STATE </p><p>CARDINAL ANGELO SODANO, WAS RELEASED BY THE VATICAN APRIL 26 </p><p>FOLLOWING CASTRO\'S APPARENT FAILURE TO RESPOND.   THE LETTER </p><p>CONVEYED THE POPE\'S "DEEP PAIN" OVER THE RECENT EXECUTIONS </p><p>AND HEAVY SENTENCES GIVEN TO DISSIDENTS.  IN THE LETTER, THE </p><p>POPE CALLED ON CASTRO TO MAKE A "SIGNIFICANT GESTURE OF </p><p>CLEMENCY," ADDING THAT SUCH A GESTURE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO </p><p>GREATER HARMONY AMONG THE CUBAN PEOPLE.  THE POPE CONCLUDED </p><p>BY SUGGESTING HE WAS SURE THAT CASTRO SHARED THE CONVICTION </p><p>THAT ONLY SINCERE AND CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN CITIZENS </p><p>AND CIVIL AUTHORITIES CAN GUARANTEE THE ADVANCEMENT OF A </p><p>MODERN AND DEMOCRATIC STATE, IN A MORE UNITED AND FRATERNAL </p><p>CUBA. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) EMBASSY CONTACTED HOLY SEE OFFICIALS APRIL 28 TO </p><p>EXPLORE THE BACKGROUND BEHIND THE VATICAN\'S RELEASE OF THE </p><p>LETTER AND ITS UNUSUAL DIRECT APPEAL TO CASTRO.  COUNTRY </p><p>DIRECTOR FOR CUBA, MONSIGNOR GIORGIO LINGUA TOLD POLOFF THAT </p><p>THE POPE HAD DECIDED TO SEND THE LETTER (DELIVERED TO CUBA\'S </p><p>AMBASSADOR TO THE HOLY SEE) AFTER THE HOLY SEE\'S "QUIET </p><p>DIPLOMACY BEHIND THE SCENES" HAD FAILED TO EVOKE ANY RESPONSE </p><p>FROM CUBA.  LINGUA UNDERSCORED THAT THE LETTER WAS MEANT TO </p><p>PROTEST BOTH THE EXECUTIONS AND THE HARSH SENTENCES RECENTLY </p><p>IMPOSED ON THE SEVENTY-PLUS CUBAN DISSIDENTS.  HE WOULD NOT </p><p>CHARACTERIZE THE STRONGLY WORDED LETTER AS A NEW DIRECTION IN </p><p>THE HOLY SEE\'S CUBA APPROACH, BUT RATHER HE SAID IT WAS </p><p>NATURAL TO "STEP UP THE VOLUME" AFTER THE CASTRO REGIME\'S </p><p>    SUDDEN RATCHETING UP OF REPRESSION AGAINST POLITICAL </p><p>DISSIDENTS, MANY OF WHOM ARE PRACTICING CATHOLICS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) DCM ALSO QUERIED VATICAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>PIETRO PAROLIN AS TO WHAT HAD PROMPTED THE PAPAL APPEAL. </p><p>PAROLIN SAID THE DECISIONS TO APPROACH CASTRO DIRECTLY AND TO </p><p>RELEASE THE LETTER WERE TAKEN AT THE REQUEST OF THE CUBAN </p><p>BISHOPS, WHO HAD CONVEYED TO THE HOLY SEE THAT A PAPAL </p><p>INTERVENTION WOULD BE TIMELY AND HELPFUL IN THE FACE OF THE </p><p>CUBAN GOVERNMENT ACTIONS.  DCM WELCOMED THE HOLY SEE\'S </p><p>ENGAGEMENT AND ENCOURAGED CONTINUED EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE </p><p>DISSIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST:  EVEN THOUGH THE HOLY SEE </p><p>IS RELUCTANT TO CHARACTERIZE THE PAPAL LETTER AND PUBLIC </p><p>RELEASE AS A NEW APPROACH IN ITS RELATIONS WITH CUBA, THE </p><p>ACTIONS DO REPRESENT A DEPARTURE FROM THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH </p><p>OUTLINED TO US ONLY A MONTH AGO WHEN LINGUA SPOKE OF THE HOLY </p><p>SEE\'S NEED TO PROTECT THE "VULNERABLE" CHURCH PRESENCE IN </p><p>CUBA (REF A).  THERE IS ALSO LITTLE DOUBT THAT DIRECT APPEALS </p><p>TO THE POPE FROM THE SPOUSES OF DETAINED DISSIDENTS, COMBINED </p><p>WITH QUESTIONING LAST WEEK IN THE ITALIAN PRESS ABOUT THE </p><p>HOLY SEE\'S SILENCE IN THE FACE OF THE CUBAN REPRESSION HELPED </p><p>EVOKE THE LETTER\'S RELEASE.  ALTHOUGH THE VATICAN\'S NATURAL </p><p>PREDILECTION IS ALWAYS TO WORK BEHIND THE SCENES, THE SUCCESS </p><p>OF THE POPE\'S JANUARY BROADSIDE AGAINST RUSSIAN RESTRICTIONS </p><p>ON CATHOLIC PRIESTS (REF C) HAS PERHAPS GIVEN ADDED </p><p>SUSTENANCE TO THE VATICAN\'S REGARD FOR THE POTENTIAL OF </p><p>STRONG, PUBLIC ACTIONS IN THE FACE OF INJUSTICE.  WE WILL </p><p>CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE HOLY SEE\'S ENGAGEMENT TO EFFECT THE </p><p>RELEASE OF THE DISSIDENTS, AND WOULD WELCOME ANY ADDITIONAL </p><p>    POINTS THAT MIGHT BE OF USE TO SHARE WITH THE VATICAN. </p><p> </p><p>NICHOLSON </p><p> </p><p>NNN </p><p></p></div>
