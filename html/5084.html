<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 000252 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/13/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, SNAR, KCRM, NO, NL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MULLAH KREKAR:  JORDAN UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO MEET </p><p>DUTCH REQUESTS FOR MORE EVIDENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) STATE 9307 </p><p>     B. B) AMMAN 150 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  Charge and PolCouns delivered ref a points January </p><p>13 to Ali al-Ayed, personal assistant to Foreign Minister </p><p>Muasher, and Samer Naber, MFA Legal Advisor.  Charge </p><p>encouraged the GOJ to provide to the Dutch as much as </p><p>possible of the additional evidentiary and legal information </p><p>they have requested, and to continue to consult with the </p><p>Dutch on how to build the strongest possible legal case for </p><p>extradition.  He also offered additional USG assistance if </p><p>the GOJ thought it would be helpful.  The best outcome for </p><p>both Jordan and the U.S., he stressed, would be Krekar\'s </p><p>extradition to Jordan.  Jordan should do as much as possible </p><p>to achieve that goal.  Even if Jordan is not able to respond </p><p>to all of the GONL\'s requests for further information, the </p><p>Charge stressed, it should provide at least a partial </p><p>response.  He emphasized that any additional Jordanian </p><p>information would have to be supplied in the next few days to </p><p>be of use in the scheduled January 23 extradition hearing. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Ayed, recalling that the Minister and the Ambassador </p><p>had discussed this a few days ago (ref b), responded that he </p><p>would pass our comments on to FonMin Muasher.  Jordan, he </p><p>continued, had received and studied the December 19, 2002 </p><p>Dutch request for further information on the Krekar case. </p><p>However, again citing the Minister\'s earlier conversation, </p><p>Ayed said he did not believe that the GOJ would be in a </p><p>position to provide to the Dutch "what they want" (i.e. </p><p>additional intelligence evidence on which the narcotics </p><p>charges are based).  He said that FonMin Muasher had conveyed </p><p>this point to Dutch Ambassador Marjanne de Kwaasteniet in </p><p>Amman this week. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  ROAL separately make a parallel presentation to </p><p>the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate. </p><p> </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
