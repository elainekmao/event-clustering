<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 RANGOON 000757 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP AND INL </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p>DEA FOR OF,OFF </p><p>CDR USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SNAR, KCRM, BM </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S COUNTERNARCOTICS PERFORMANCE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 100273 </p><p>     B. STATE 153955 </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The Burmese government (GOB) has reduced opium </p><p>cultivation, cooperated with the United States, Australia, </p><p>China, Thailand, and other states on a series of major </p><p>narcotics cases, and continued to prosecute traffickers.  It </p><p>has failed in regard to its new money laundering law, whose </p><p>implementation has been delayed by the collapse of Burma\'s </p><p>private banking system.  The GOB has deliberately chosen to </p><p>give the Wa and other former insurgent groups time to exit </p><p>the narcotics trade - the last of these grace periods expires </p><p>in 2005.  The GOB has cracked down whenever former insurgent </p><p>groups have broken their pledges and, after 2005, the United </p><p>Wa State Army, like all other groups in Burma, will be fair </p><p>game for government enforcement actions.  Burma\'s current </p><p>narcotics legislation (basically the 1993 Law on Narcotic </p><p>Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) is more than adequate for </p><p>the investigation and prosecution of major drug offenses.  It </p><p>has been used already to put more than 10,000 felons behind </p><p>bars with sentences in excess of ten years each.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. The paragraphs below are keyed to the criteria outlined in </p><p>our counternarcotics demarche (reftel A). </p><p> </p><p>3. Facilitate the participation of independent monitors to </p><p>verify poppy eradication and other counternarcotics efforts. </p><p> </p><p>Burma cooperates with the United States on its annual opium </p><p>yield survey and UNODC on census surveys of opium production. </p><p> In fact, all recent estimates of opium and heroin production </p><p>in Burma have been compiled by the United States and the </p><p>United Nations on the basis of these surveys.  According to </p><p>the United States, Burma reduced opium production by more </p><p>than three-quarters between 1996 and 2002.  According the </p><p>United Nations, Burma reduced its opium production by more </p><p>than half over the same period.  The results of the U.S. </p><p>survey in 2003 is not yet available.  According to the United </p><p>Nations, Burma reduced its opium fields by a further 24 </p><p>percent in 2003, despite good weather.  By their estimate, </p><p>the acreage under opium cultivation in Burma in 2003 declined </p><p>to only 62,200 hectares, down more than 100,000 hectares from </p><p>the area under cultivation in 1996. </p><p> </p><p>Burma cooperates closely with the United States\' Drug </p><p>Enforcement Administration and the Australian Federal Police </p><p>on narcotics enforcement activities.  Both DEA and AFP </p><p>maintain active offices in Burma.  Both offices have </p><p>maintained detailed records of the Burmese government\'s </p><p>seizures, arrests, and other law enforcement operations in </p><p>recent years.  DEA\'s file, compiled and verified by agents </p><p>who have been involved in investigations in Burma, is </p><p>available in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>4. Arrest and prosecute the senior leadership of heroin and </p><p>methamphetamine trafficking organizations. </p><p> </p><p>Burma has arrested over 90,000 persons on drug-related </p><p>charges over the past 15 years.  Through the end of 2002, 42 </p><p>persons were sentenced to death for drug-related offenses in </p><p>Burma, and another 37 were imprisoned for life.  During the </p><p>same period, more than 12,500 persons were sentenced to </p><p>prison for ten years or more for narcotics-related offenses. </p><p>These arrests and prosecutions continued in 2003.  While </p><p>statistics on prosecutions are not yet available, preliminary </p><p>data indicate that Burma arrested more than 700 suspects in </p><p>drug-related cases during the first three months of 2003. </p><p> </p><p>Many of these arrests and convictions involved major drug </p><p>syndicates.  Many also involved close cooperation with the </p><p>United States, Australia, and other western law enforcement </p><p>agencies.  Among the most notable were the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Cooperation with the United States and China in the </p><p>investigation of the "1-2-5" syndicate, which led to the </p><p>arrest of 28 persons in the United States, Hong Kong, China, </p><p>and India in May 2003.  Reportedly, this group had been </p><p>responsible for the export of more than $100 million in </p><p>heroin to the United States since 2000. </p><p> </p><p>-- Cooperation with China in a series of arrests and seizures </p><p>that have continued throughout 2001 and 2002 all along the </p><p>Chinese border following the signature of a Chinese/Burmese </p><p>MOU on counternarcotics operations in January 2001.  Since </p><p>then, Burma has turned over 60 fugitives to China, including </p><p>members of one group (Tan Xiao Lin and company) which China </p><p>described as the "largest armed drug-trafficking gang in the </p><p>Golden Triangle." </p><p> </p><p>-- Cooperation with Thailand in the seizure of 116 kilograms </p><p>of heroin and 7.8 million methamphetamine tablets in February </p><p>2002.  Two of the principals behind this shipment were also </p><p>eventually convicted in Rangoon and sentenced to "indefinite" </p><p>(i.e., unending) terms in prison. </p><p> </p><p>-- Cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement </p><p>Administration and the Australian Federal Police in the </p><p>seizure of 357 kilograms of heroin in Fiji in October 2000. </p><p>Death sentences were eventually handed down in Rangoon for </p><p>two drug kingpins connected with this case. </p><p> </p><p>5. Establish a mechanism for reliable measurement of </p><p>methamphetamine production and demonstrate progress in </p><p>reducing production and increasing seizures. </p><p> </p><p>There is no mechanism for reliably measuring illicit </p><p>methamphetamine production in any country, including the US. </p><p>The most commonly used procedure is to take seizures and </p><p>multiply by 10.  If applied to Burma, that measure would </p><p>suggest production of 320 million tablets in 2001, 94 million </p><p>tablets in 2002, and 19 million tablets during the first </p><p>three months of 2003.  However, the GOB believe that this </p><p>reduction in seizures is due more to changing patterns of </p><p>methamphetamine production and trafficking than it is to the </p><p>overall reduction in production.  Since 2002, under pressure </p><p>from the GOB, more traffickers have taken to mixing chemicals </p><p>at sites along the Chinese/Burmese border and then shipping </p><p>the product in powder or crystal form along the Mekong River </p><p>to plants in Laos, Thailand, and Burma where the drug is </p><p>flavored for local markets and stamped into tablets.  The net </p><p>result is that the product spends far less time in Burma than </p><p>before; hence, the lower seizures. </p><p> </p><p>6. Establish an effective program for the control of </p><p>precursor chemicals. </p><p> </p><p>Burma does not have a precursor chemical industry; nor does </p><p>it produce any of the precursor chemicals used in the </p><p>manufacture of heroin, amphetamine-type stimulants, or other </p><p>synthetic drugs.  All chemicals used for the production of </p><p>narcotics in Burma (with the exception of opium itself) are </p><p>imported from China, India, Thailand, and other states.  None </p><p>are produced locally. </p><p> </p><p>Burma has outlawed 25 precursor chemicals, including </p><p>ephedrine, acetic anhydride, and even caffeine (in bulk). </p><p>However, it has not yet been able to stem trafficking from </p><p>neighboring countries, despite seizures in 2002 which </p><p>amounted to 2,900 liters of acetic anhydride, 26,000 liters </p><p>of chemical liquids, 4,800 kilograms of chemical powders, and </p><p>1,700 kilograms of ephedrine.  On the other hand, it has </p><p>begun to build the international cooperation that is required </p><p>to control this trade.  In January 2003, Burma held its first </p><p>trilateral conference with India and China on precursor </p><p>chemicals, and in March met bilaterally with India on the </p><p>same topic.  As a result of those meetings, India is now </p><p>considering creating a 100-mile wide exclusion zone along its </p><p>border with Burma within which any possession of ephedrine </p><p>would be illegal.  A similar zone on the Indian frontier </p><p>already exists for acetic anhydride. </p><p> </p><p>7.  Create a special task force of police and prosecutors to </p><p>target and investigate high-level drug traffickers and drug </p><p>trafficking groups. </p><p> </p><p>Drug enforcement efforts in Burma are led by the Central </p><p>Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), which is comprised </p><p>of personnel from the police, customs, military intelligence, </p><p>and the army.  CCDAC now has 21 drug-enforcement task forces </p><p>around the country, with most located in major cities and </p><p>along key transit routes near Burma\'s borders with China, </p><p>India, and Thailand.  CCDAC\'s units are underfunded and badly </p><p>equipped.  Nevertheless, they are bringing narcotics </p><p>traffickers to heel and securing convictions.  As noted </p><p>above, more than 90,000 persons have been arrested for </p><p>narcotics-related offenses in Burma over the past 15 years </p><p>and more than 10,000 have sentenced to 10 years or more in </p><p>prison.  CCDAC has also developed arrangements for </p><p>cooperation with the United States, China, Thailand, and </p><p>India, among others, that have allowed law enforcement agents </p><p>around the world to move effectively against major drug </p><p>cartels. </p><p> </p><p>Burma, in short, has an organization that has already proved </p><p>that it can move effectively against high-level drug </p><p>traffickers and drug trafficking groups.  What it does not </p><p>have is a political situation that will allow it to move </p><p>aggressively against former insurgent groups, like the United </p><p>Wa State Army and others implicated in the drug trade, for </p><p>fear of reigniting the insurgencies that devastated eastern </p><p>Burma for so many decades before 1989.  Burma has </p><p>deliberately chosen to slowly wean these former insurgent </p><p>groups from their dependence on the narcotics trade, while </p><p>building power at the center to use when the grace periods it </p><p>has allowed these groups run out.  In 1997, the Eastern Shan </p><p>State Army of Sai Lin promised to end opium production in its </p><p>cease-fire area and did so.  In 2000, the Kokang Chinese of </p><p>Pen Kya Shin broke their pledge to end opium production and, </p><p>since 2001, have been raked by counter-narcotics operations </p><p>that have been mounted by both the Burmese and Chinese </p><p>governments.  In 2003, as a result, opium production in the </p><p>Kokang Chinese capital district of Lawkai was a mere fraction </p><p>(20 percent) of its level two years earlier.  In 2005, the </p><p>United Wa State Army is scheduled to end opium production. </p><p>If it fails, it will get the same treatment from the Chinese </p><p>and Burmese that the Kokang Chinese have already tasted. </p><p> </p><p>8.  Fully implement and enforce Burma\'s money-laundering </p><p>legislation. </p><p> </p><p>The GOB enacted new and relatively powerful money laundering </p><p>legislation in June 2002.  That legislation criminalizes </p><p>money laundering in connection with virtually every kind of </p><p>serious criminal activity and levies heavy responsibilities </p><p>on banks in regard to reporting.  Penalties are also </p><p>substantial.  Implementation of the new legislation has </p><p>lagged, however.  While the government held training seminars </p><p>on money laundering, started several investigations, and </p><p>seized assets in connection with several major narcotics </p><p>cases, it has not yet prosecuted these cases as violations of </p><p>the money-laundering law.  Neither has it published </p><p>regulations to guide bank reporting in regard to suspicious </p><p>transactions. </p><p> </p><p>The net result is that the government is effectively working </p><p>only with the asset seizure provisions of its 1993 narcotics </p><p>law.  Perhaps deterred by a banking system crisis which </p><p>ripped through the country in February 2003, it has not </p><p>really yet put its money laundering legislation to work. </p><p> </p><p>9.  Take effective measures to stem the flow of illicit drug </p><p>money into the banking system and economic enterprises and to </p><p>end joint economic ventures with the leaders of drug </p><p>trafficking organizations. </p><p> </p><p>Money, illicit or otherwise, is not flowing into Burma\'s </p><p>banking system, which collapsed in February 2003.  Since then </p><p>deposits at Burma\'s banks have declined by estimated 40 </p><p>percent, with the hardest hit banks being those, like the </p><p>Asia Wealth Bank, Myanmar Mayflower Bank, and Myanmar </p><p>Oriental Bank, that were rumored to have connections with </p><p>criminal elements.  The GOB has not attempted to bail the </p><p>banks out of their current predicament; rather, it has let </p><p>them slowly collapse as monuments to bad banking. </p><p> </p><p>A variety of factors contributed to this banking system </p><p>crash, including a long-standing climate of financial </p><p>repression, the collapse of Burma\'s informal financial </p><p>institutions, and the introduction of Burma\'s new money </p><p>laundering law, which required bank depositors to prove, if </p><p>challenged, the legal origin of their funds.  Since accurate </p><p>record-keeping is a rarely practiced art in Burma, many </p><p>businessmen reacted to the new legislation, and the </p><p>possibility that the government might seize their funds, by </p><p>withdrawing their deposits.  This was probably not the </p><p>primary cause of the crash, but was one of the straws that </p><p>broke the back of Burma\'s banks. </p><p> </p><p>The GOB does not have joint ventures with the leaders of drug </p><p>trafficking organizations.  Rather, it has given corporations </p><p>like the United Wa State Party\'s Hong Pang Company outright </p><p>concessions for the operation of a variety of businesses </p><p>which range from farms to ranches to ruby mines and other </p><p>trading and industrial establishments.  This has been </p><p>controversial, both in Burma and abroad, but the GOB has </p><p>argued that it is necessary, for two reason: (1) to give </p><p>known narcotics trafficking groups an alternative source of </p><p>income; (2) to tie these groups more closely to the Burmese </p><p>economy.  The Burmese view is that these former insurgents </p><p>are less likely to go back into rebellion if they have </p><p>interests in the Burmese economy. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Amend Burma\'s substantive and procedural criminal laws </p><p>to facilitate effective investigation and prosecution of </p><p>major drug traffickers. </p><p> </p><p>With UNODC\'s assistance, Burma has recently completed the </p><p>draft of a new mutual legal assistance law which will </p><p>facilitate legal and judicial cooperation with other </p><p>countries.  Reportedly, this draft legislation will be made </p><p>law later this year.  The legal regime will also be helped by </p><p>the final publication of the rules and regulations for the </p><p>2002 money laundering law.  However, with the banking system </p><p>now imploding, that is not a critical issue. </p><p> </p><p>Otherwise, Burma\'s current narcotics legislation (basically </p><p>the 1993 Law on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) </p><p>is more than adequate for the investigation and prosecution </p><p>of major drug offenses.  It is completely in compliance with </p><p>the recommendations of the 1988 UN Drug Convention and has </p><p>been used already to put more than 10,000 felons behind bars </p><p>with sentences in excess of ten years each. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
