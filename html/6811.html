(U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) COM convened Abu Dhabi\'s Iraq Task Force/Core </p><p>Emergency Action Committee (EAC) at 1000 local time, Wednesday </p><p>3/26.  Embassy Abu Dhabi, FCS (located outside of the Embassy </p><p>compound), and the USGS office in Al Ain are open 3/26 with full </p><p>staffing. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The consular section is open for visa services and </p><p>American Citizen Services.  The American community remains calm; </p><p>CONS has not received calls from worried AMCITs. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) CONS proposed and Task Force approved, issuance of a </p><p>warden update to alert Americans in the UAE that there have been </p><p>minor disruptions in air traffic in and out of the UAE.  The </p><p>message, in an effort to counteract rumors, also informs that </p><p>there have been no hostile actions against Americans or U.S. </p><p>interests in the UAE.  The message urges Americans to remain </p><p>vigilant. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) American business community contacts continue to report </p><p>that private American citizens and U.S. companies located here </p><p>have not departed the UAE on a large scale.  RSO reported that </p><p>the Abu Dhabi Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) </p><p>continues to meet on a daily basis. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------ </p><p>DUBAI TELETHON RAISES $13 MILLION FOR IRAQI HUMANITARIAN RELIEF </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) ECON noted that the 12-hour telethon conducted </p><p>yesterday on Dubai TV and radio raised DHS 49 million ($13.3 </p><p>million) for humanitarian relief in Iraq.  Sponsored by Dubai </p><p>Crown Prince Muhammad bin Rashid Al-Maktoum\'s Charitable and </p><p>Humanitarian Foundation, the telethon featured appearances by </p><p>local and Arab notables, including outspoken Dubai Police Chief </p><p>General Dhahi Khalfan, who sharply criticized coalition military </p><p>actions in Iraq and called on the American and British </p><p>Ambassadors to the UAE to "honestly report to their governments </p><p>the strong anti-war sentiments of the public."  Also making </p><p>appearances were an Iraqi Sunni cleric, Shaykh Ahmed Al-Qubaisi, </p><p>and "Raghda," a Syrian actress well-known for her close ties to </p><p>the Iraqi regime (many in the Iraqi expat community here claim </p><p>she is one of several Arab entertainers on Saddam\'s payroll). </p><p>Al-Qubaisi called on Arabs to rise up against the </p><p>American/British "ijtiyah" (invasion) and at one point, </p><p>collapsed into tears, predicting that the U.S. is "redrawing the </p><p>map of the Arab world with Iraqi blood."  (Comment:  This </p><p>telethon, like the emotionally-charged one held in April 2002 </p><p>during the Israeli incursion into Jenin, is seen by the </p><p>leadership as an effective tool for containing public anger and </p><p>frustration.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ECON also reported that hawala remittances to Iraq from </p><p>UAE residents had stopped due to difficulties in transferring </p><p>money since the onset of hostilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Currently on spring break vacation, the American </p><p>Community School will resume classes on Saturday 3/29.  The RSO </p><p>reported that the buses used for ferrying Embassy children will </p><p>not be used for four days after class resumption as a </p><p>precautionary measure.  On the fifth day, the buses will be </p><p>used, but will be switched on a regular basis to alter busing </p><p>patterns. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) RSO reported that on 3/25, two journalists from the </p><p>country of Georgia were questioned by local police after they </p><p>attempted to photograph the Embassy compound.  The RSO informed </p><p>the journalists that photographs of the Embassy were not </p><p>permitted and referred them to the UAE Ministry of Information. </p><p>10.  (S/NF) ORCA reported that there continue to be reports of a </p><p>possible chemical attack on Americans or U.S. interests </p><p>worldwide.  Although reporting specific to the Gulf continues, </p><p>there have been no threat reports specific to the UAE. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>Local Media </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (U) PAO reported that Abu Dhabi TV will feature a live </p><p>interview with Secretary Powell this evening conducted by </p><p>correspondents from Abu Dhabi TV, Al-Jazeera and Egyptian </p><p>Satellite TV. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) PAO indicated that, with the exception of Abu Dhabi </p><p>government-owned Al-Ittihad, the local Arabic papers are not </p><p>balanced in their reporting on the war.  PAO will engage with </p><p>the press to encourage more balanced coverage. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Abu Dhabi Iraq Task Force/EAC will reconvene at </p><p>1000 local time, Saturday 3/29. </p><p> </p><p>14.  (U) Iraq Task Force/EAC members in attendance included </p><p>AMB, DCM, RSO, DAO, P/M, POL, ECON, CONS, MSG, PAO, </p><p>ADMIN, and USLO. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
