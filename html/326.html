END SUMMARY. </p><p></p><p>2.  BEGIN TEXT: </p><p></p><p>MR. CHAIRMAN: </p><p></p><p> I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A PROCEDURAL POINT.  THE U.S. </p><p>IS VERY PLEASED THAT THE OUTLAW REGIME OF NORIEGA HAS </p><p>GIVEN WAY TO A GOVERNMENT THAT REFLECTS THE WILL OF THE </p><p>PANAMANIAN PEOPLE. </p><p></p><p> I THINK WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT THERE IS A RAPIDLY CHANGING </p><p>AND VERY COMPLEX SITUATION IN PANAMA.  THE ORIGIN AND </p><p>NATURE OF THIS CRISIS NEED TO BE EXPLORED.  IN THE VIEW OF </p><p>MY GOVERNMENT, THE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE OF PANAMA IS </p><p>NOT PRESENT HERE IN THIS MEETING. </p><p></p><p> THE PRESIDENT THIS MORNING DIRECTED UNITED STATES </p><p>MILITARY FORCES TO EXECUTE AT 1:00 AM THIS MORNING </p><p>MISSIONS IN PANAMA DESIGNED TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES AND </p><p>TO DEFEND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES.  IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE CHARTER OF THIS </p><p>ORGANIZATION, AND OF ARTICLES 51 AND 52 OF THE CHARTER OF </p><p>THE UNITED NATIONS, I HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO BRIEF YOU ON </p><p>THIS ACTION OF THE UNITED STATES. </p><p></p><p> UNITED STATES FORCES HAVE EXERCISED THEIR INHERENT RIGHT </p><p>OF SELF-DEFENSE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW BY TAKING ACTION </p><p>IN PANAMA IN RESPONSE TO ARMED ATTACKS BY FORCES UNDER THE </p><p>DIRECTION OF MANUEL NORIEGA. </p><p></p><p> THE SITUATION IN PANAMA UNDER NORIEGA HAD BECOME </p><p>UNSUSTAINABLE.  35,000 CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES LIVE </p><p>IN PANAMA.  THEIR LIVES WERE SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED.  THE </p><p>INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES WAS AT RISK AS THE </p><p>RESULT OF THE PRESSURES, ABUSES, AND -- YES -- FORCE OF A </p><p>MAN WHO IS UNDER INDICTMENT FOR DRUG-RELATED CHARGES.  THE </p><p>PRESIDENT MADE EVERY EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION </p><p>PEACEFULLY THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AND LATIN AMERICAN </p><p>LEADERS.  MR. NORIEGA REJECTED ALL THESE EFFORTS. </p><p></p><p> I AM CERTAIN THAT MANY OF YOU HEARD PRESIDENT BUSH AT </p><p>7:20 AM THIS MORNING.  I ASK YOUR INDULGENCE: </p><p></p><p> BEGIN QUOTE: </p><p></p><p> MY FELLOW CITIZENS, LAST NIGHT I ORDERED U.S. MILITARY </p><p>FORCES TO PANAMA.  NO PRESIDENT TAKES SUCH ACTION </p><p>LIGHTLY.  THIS MORNING, I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT I DID AND </p><p>WHY I DID IT. </p><p></p><p> FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS, THE UNITED STATES, NATIONS OF LATIN </p><p>AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO RESOLVE </p><p>THE CRISIS IN PANAMA.  THE GOALS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE </p><p>BEEN TO SAFEGUARD THE LIVES OF AMERICANS, TO DEFEND </p><p>DEMOCRACY IN PANAMA, TO COMBAT DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO </p><p>PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY.  MANY </p><p>ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS THROUGH </p><p>DIPLOMACY AND NEGOTIATIONS.  ALL WERE REJECTED BY THE </p><p>DICTATOR OF PANAMA, GENERAL MANUEL NORIEGA, AN INDICTED </p><p>DRUG TRAFFICKER. </p><p></p><p> LAST FRIDAY, NORIEGA DECLARED HIS MILITARY DICTATORSHIP </p><p>TO BE IN A STATE OF WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES AND </p><p>PUBLICLY THREATENED THE LIVES OF AMERICANS IN PANAMA.  THE </p><p>VERY NEXT DAY, FORCES UNDER HIS COMMAND SHOT AND KILLED AN </p><p>UNARMED AMERICAN SERVICEMAN, WOUNDED ANOTHER, ARRESTED AND </p><p>BRUTALLY BEAT A THIRD AMERICAN SERVICEMAN, AND THEN </p><p>BRUTALLY INTERROGATED HIS WIFE, THREATENED HER WITH SEXUAL </p><p>ABUSE. </p><p></p><p> THAT WAS ENOUGH. </p><p></p><p> GENERAL NORIEGA\'S RECKLESS THREATS AND ATTACKS UPON </p><p>AMERICANS IN PANAMA CREATED AN IMMINENT DANGER TO THE </p><p>35,000 AMERICAN CITIZENS IN PANAMA.  AS PRESIDENT, I HAVE </p><p>NO HIGHER OBLIGATION THAN TO SAFEGUARD THE LIVES OF </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS.  AND THAT IS WHY I DIRECTED OUR ARMED </p><p>FORCES TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF AMERICAN CITIZENS IN PANAMA </p><p>AND TO BRING GENERAL NORIEGA TO JUSTICE IN THE UNITED </p><p>STATES.  I CONTACTED THE BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP OF CONGRESS </p><p>LAST NIGHT AND INFORMED THEM OF THIS DECISION, AND AFTER </p><p>TAKING THIS ACTION, I ALSO TALKED WITH LEADERS IN LATIN </p><p>AMERICA, THE CARIBBEAN, AND THOSE OF OTHER U.S. ALLIES. </p><p></p><p> AT THIS MOMENT, U.S. FORCES, INCLUDING FORCES DEPLOYED </p><p>FROM THE UNITED STATES LAST NIGHT, ARE ENGAGED IN ACTION </p><p>IN PANAMA.  THE UNITED STATES INTENDS TO WITHDRAW THE </p><p>FORCES NEWLY DEPLOYED TO PANAMA AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. </p><p>OUR FORCES HAVE CONDUCTED THEMSELVES COURAGEOUSLY AND </p><p>SELFLESSLY.  AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, I SALUTE EVERY ONE OF </p><p>THEM AND THANK THEM ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY. </p><p></p><p> TRAGICALLY, SOME AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES ALREADY </p><p>IN DEFENSE OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS, IN DEFENSE OF </p><p>DEMOCRACY.  MY HEART GOES OUT TO THEIR FAMILIES.  WE ALSO </p><p>REGRET AND MOURN THE LOSS OF INNOCENT PANAMANIANS. </p><p></p><p> THE BRAVE PANAMANIANS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE IN THE </p><p>ELECTIONS HELD LAST MAY -- PRESIDENT GUILLERMO ENDARA AND </p><p>VICE PRESIDENTS CALDERON AND FORD -- HAVE ASSUMED THE </p><p>RIGHTFUL LEADERSHIP OF THEIR COUNTRY.  YOU REMEMBER THOSE </p><p>HORRIBLE PICTURES OF NEWLY-ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT FORD, </p><p>COVERED HEAD TO TOE WITH BLOOD, BEATEN MERCILESSLY BY </p><p>SO-CALLED "DIGNITY BATALLIONS."  WELL, THE UNITED STATES </p><p>TODAY RECOGNIZES THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>PRESIDENT ENDARA.  I WILL SEND OUR AMBASSADOR BACK TO </p><p>PANAMA IMMEDIATELY. </p><p></p><p> KEY MILITARY OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED.  MOST </p><p>ORGANIZED RESISTANCE HAS BEEN ELIMINATED.  BUT THE </p><p>OPERATION IS NOT OVER YET.  GENERAL NORIEGA IS IN HIDING. </p><p>AND NEVERTHELESS, YESTERDAY, A DICTATOR RULED PANAMA; AND </p><p>TODAY, CONSTITUTIONALLY ELECTED LEADERS GOVERN. </p><p></p><p> I HAVE TODAY DIRECTED THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY AND </p><p>THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO LIFT THE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS WITH </p><p>RESPECT TO THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>PANAMA, AND IN COOPERATION WITH THAT GOVERNMENT, TO TAKE </p><p>STEPS TO EFFECT AN ORDERLY UNBLOCKING OF PANAMANIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT ASSETS IN THE UNITED STATES.  I AM FULLY </p><p>COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES AND TO </p><p>TURN OVER THE CANAL TO PANAMA IN THE YEAR 2000. </p><p></p><p> THE ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN AND THE COOPERATION OF A NEW </p><p>DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN PANAMA WILL PERMIT US TO HONOR </p><p>THESE COMMITMENTS.  AS SOON AS THE NEW GOVERNMENT </p><p>RECOMMENDS A QUALIFIED PANAMANIAN CANDIDATE TO BE </p><p>ADMINISTRATOR OF THE CANAL AS CALLED FOR IN THE TREATIES, </p><p>I WILL SUBMIT THIS NOMINEE TO THE SENATE FOR EXPEDITED </p><p>CONSIDERATION. </p><p></p><p> I AM COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE </p><p>DEMOCRATIC NATIONS OF THIS HEMISPHERE.  I WILL CONTINUE TO </p><p>SEEK SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS OF THIS REGION THROUGH </p><p>DIALOGUE AND MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY. </p><p></p><p> I TOOK THIS ACTION ONLY AFTER REACHING THE CONCLUSION </p><p>THAT EVERY OTHER AVENUE WAS CLOSED AND THE LIVES OF </p><p>AMERICAN CITIZENS WERE IN GRAVE DANGER.  I HOPE THAT THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF PANAMA WILL PUT THIS DARK CHAPTER OF </p><p>DICTATORSHIP BEHIND THEM AND MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER AS </p><p>CITIZENS OF A DEMOCRATIC PANAMA WITH THIS GOVERNMENT THAT </p><p>THEY, THEMSELVES, HAVE ELECTED. </p><p></p><p> THE UNITED STATES IS EAGER TO WORK WITH THE PANAMANIAN </p><p>PEOPLE IN PARTNERSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP TO REBUILD THEIR </p><p>ECONOMY.  THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE WANT DEMOCRACY, PEACE, AND </p><p>THE CHANCE FOR A BETTER LIFE IN DIGNITY AND FREEDOM.  THE </p><p>PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES SEEK ONLY TO SUPPORT THEM IN </p><p>PURSUIT OF THESE NOBLE GOALS. </p><p></p><p> END QUOTE. </p><p></p><p>MR. CHAIRMAN: </p><p></p><p> PRESIDENT BUSH TOOK THIS ACTION ONLY AFTER EXHAUSTING </p><p>EVERY AVAILABLE DIPLOMATIC AND MULTILATERAL MEANS TO </p><p>RESOLVE THIS CRISIS.  FROM THE MOMENT NORIEGA HAD BRUTALLY </p><p>ANNULLED THE MAY 7 ELECTIONS, PRESIDENT BUSH SUPPORTED THE </p><p>ARDUOUS EFFORTS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES TO </p><p>RESOLVE THE CRISIS BY FACILITATING A PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF </p><p>POWER THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. </p><p></p><p> DESPITE THE MOST DEDICATED EFFORTS OF THE TWENTY-FIRST </p><p>MEETING OF CONSULTATION OF FOREIGN MINISTERS, NORIEGA </p><p>STEADFASTLY DENIED THE RIGHTS OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE TO </p><p>CHOOSE A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.  INSTEAD, HE FLOUTED THE </p><p>DECISIONS OF THE MEETING OF CONSULTATION AS WELL AS THE </p><p>CONSTITUTION OF PANAMA, WHICH CALLED FOR A TRANSFER OF </p><p>POWER, THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS, BY SEPTEMBER 1. </p><p></p><p> NORIEGA\'S SYSTEMIC AND SYSTEMATIC VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF PANAMA PROMPTED THE OAS GENERAL </p><p>ASSEMBLY LAST MONTH TO TAKE THE UNUSUAL STEP OF </p><p>SPECIFICALLY ENDORSING THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE SPECIAL </p><p>REPORT ON PANAMA OF THE INTER-AMERICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN </p><p>RIGHTS, A REPORT THAT CAN ONLY BE CHARACTERIZED AS </p><p>"DEVASTATING" IN ITS IMPACT.  THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED A </p><p>RESOLUTION WHICH RESOLVES "TO EXPRESS ITS DEEP CONCERN FOR </p><p>THE SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES </p><p>IN PANAMA, ESPECIALLY THOSE BEARING ON THE FULL OBSERVANCE </p><p>OF CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, AS THE INTER-AMERICAN </p><p>COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS HAS STATED IN ITS SPECIAL </p><p>REPORT ON THAT COUNTRY." </p><p></p><p> IN RECENT DAYS, THE CRISIS HAS GROWN FAR MORE DANGEROUS. </p><p>NORIEGA HAS ACTED IN AN INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE, </p><p>UNPREDICTABLE, AND DANGEROUS MANNER.  FIRST HE DECLARED </p><p>HIMSELF "MAXIMUM LEADER" LAST FRIDAY, THEN HE DECLARED A </p><p>STATE OF WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.  FOLLOWING THAT </p><p>DECLARATION OF WAR, THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES FELT </p><p>FREE TO FIRE AT MILITARY PERSONNEL OF THE UNITED STATES </p><p>STATIONED IN PANAMA UNDER THE CANAL TREATIES. </p><p></p><p> THE VIOLENT INCIDENTS WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF AN </p><p>UNARMED MILITARY OFFICER OF THE UNITED STATES AND PHYSICAL </p><p>ATTACKS ON OTHER U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL PROVOKED FEARS OF </p><p>NEW, MORE THREATENING ACTS OF VIOLENCE DIRECTED AGAINST </p><p>OUR CITIZENS IN PANAMA. </p><p></p><p> NOW THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS ACTED, UNITED STATES FORCES </p><p>WILL TAKE ONLY THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO ASSURE THE SAFETY </p><p>OF AMERICANS AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL </p><p>TREATIES.  ALL FEASIBLE MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO </p><p>MINIMIZE THE RISK OF CIVILIAN DAMAGE OR CASUALTIES.  THE </p><p>U.S. HOPES TO WITHDRAW ITS FORCES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. </p><p></p><p> THE UNITED STATES IS FULLY COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE </p><p>PANAMA CANAL TREATIES.  INDEED, AN ADDITIONAL REASON THE </p><p>PRESIDENT WAS FORCED TO ACT WAS TO SAFEGUARD THE CANAL AND </p><p>UPHOLD THE LONG-TERM INTEGRITY OF THE TREATIES UNDER </p><p>STEADY ATTACK FROM THE DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY </p><p>NORIEGA. </p><p></p><p> THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED </p><p>GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ENDARA.  IT IS IMPORTANT, IN </p><p>PARTICULAR, THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RALLY AROUND </p><p>THE NEW DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA, JUST AS IT DID </p><p>WHEN INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS SUPPORTED ENDARA, ARIAS </p><p>CALDERON, AND FORD WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED AND BRUTALIZED </p><p>FOLLOWING THE MAY 7 ELECTIONS. </p><p></p><p> WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT OUR ACTIONS </p><p>AS DOES THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA, </p><p>WHICH WE CONSULTED AND WHICH SUPPORTS OUR ACTION.  WE </p><p>PLEDGE OUR SUPPORT FOR A COMPLETE TRANSITION TO ELECTED </p><p>DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN PANAMA, TO THE FULL PROTECTION OF </p><p>THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE, AND TO THE </p><p>ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY.  WE ARE </p><p>DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED AND COMPLEX </p><p>SITUATION AND FAST BREAKING DEVELOPMENTS. </p><p></p><p> THE UNITED STATES WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THE COUNCIL </p><p>INFORMED AS EVENTS DEVELOP. </p><p></p><p> THANK YOU. </p><p></p><p>3.  END TEXT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BAKER </p><p></p></div>
