<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 001430 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, PD </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY, NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: PUBLIC RELEASE OF RECOMMENDED STATEMENT </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, ASEC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: (C) NEPAL: PROPOSED PUBLIC STATEMENT CONDEMNING </p><p>MAOIST ACTIONS LEADING TO BREAK IN CEASE-FIRE </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) KATHMANDU 1413 (B) KATMANDU 1416 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b,d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In view of increased tension between the Government of </p><p>Nepal and the Maoist leadership (reported reftels) and the </p><p>extreme pressure the Maoists have placed on the already </p><p>fragile cease-fire, Post recommends that the Department </p><p>release a public statement should the cease-fire break and </p><p>hostilities resume in Nepal.  Post suggests the following </p><p>language be included in such a statement: </p><p> </p><p>-- Strongly condemn Maoist actions systematically violating </p><p>the code of conduct for the cease-fire and precipitating the </p><p>resumption of violence in Nepal.  The Maoists\' unrealisitic </p><p>pre-conditions for a third round of talks derailed the peace </p><p>process and ignored the Government of Nepal\'s efforts to </p><p>pursue a constructive dialogue. </p><p> </p><p>-- Urge the Maoists to accept the Government of Nepal\'s </p><p>invitation to return immediately to the negotiating table.  A </p><p>military solution to the conflict is not possible.  The U.S. </p><p>Government believes that only a peacefully negotiated </p><p>settlement will resolve the conflict. </p><p> </p><p>-- Urge both sides to respect international standards for </p><p>human rights, including the prohibition against recruiting </p><p>child soldiers, and to uphold international norms prohibiting </p><p>the use of torture. </p><p> </p><p>-- The Maoists must stop the use of terror as a means to </p><p>achieve political goals. </p><p> </p><p>-- Further violence in Nepal will contribute to the </p><p>displacement of the Nepalese people and push back further the </p><p>country\'s economic and social development.  In the end, the </p><p>only losers in this conflict will be the Nepali people </p><p>themselves. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
