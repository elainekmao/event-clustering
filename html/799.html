<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L LONDON 015945 </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR NEA/ENA AND S/CT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/28/05 </p><p>TAGS:  PTER PREL PGOV KISL LY UK </p><p>SUBJECT:  MURDER OF QADHAFI OPPONENT IN LONDON </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY:  MICHAEL J. HABIB, </p><p>MINISTER-COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS.  REASON: 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, AN EXILED OPPONENT </p><p>OF QADHAFI\'S REGIME WAS FOUND STABBED TO DEATH IN HIS </p><p>WEST LONDON GROCER\'S SHOP ON SUNDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER </p><p>26.  FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS OF ALI MEHMED ABU ZEID HAVE </p><p>BEEN QUICK TO SUGGEST THAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED </p><p>BY LIBYAN SECURITY AGENTS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, ABU ZEID WAS FORCED </p><p>TO LEAVE LIBYA ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO AFTER SERVING </p><p>EIGHT MONTHS IN PRISON FOR ACTIVITIES HOSTILE TO THE </p><p>LIBYAN GOVERNMENT.  A SPOKESMAN FOR SCOTLAND YARD SAID </p><p>INVESTIGATORS WERE "KEEPING AN OPEN MIND" ABOUT THE </p><p>OTIVE WHILE NOTING THAT THE CRIME DID NOT APPEAR TO </p><p>INVOLVE BURGLARY.  HOWEVER, A POLICE SOURCE TOLD THE </p><p>PRESS THAT A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED KILLING WOULD MORE </p><p>LIKELY HAVE INVOLVED A SHOOTING OR BOMBING, AND NOT, AS </p><p>IN THIS CASE, A GRUESOME MULTIPLE STABBING.  (ACCORDING </p><p>TO TABLOID ACCOUNTS, ABU ZEID WAS STABBED IN THE BACK AT </p><p>HIS STORE\'S ENTRANCE AND THEN DISEMBOWELED OVER THE </p><p>HALAL MEAT COUNTER AT THE REAR OF THE SHOP.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  A CONTACT ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIBYAN OPPOSITION </p><p>TOLD POLOFF ON NOVEMBER 28 THAT ABU ZEID WAS AN </p><p>EXTREMELY WELL-LIKED FIGURE IN THE LOCAL LIBYAN </p><p>COMMUNITY.  HE CLAIMED THAT ABU ZEID WAS NOT INVOLVED IN </p><p>THE EMOTIONAL INTERNECINE DISPUTES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE </p><p>LIBYAN OPPOSITION MOVEMENT AND THAT HE MAINTAINED GOOD </p><p>RELATIONS WITH EVERYONE.  ABU ZEID HAD NOT BEEN </p><p>POLITICALLY ACTIVE SINCE THE LATE EIGHTIES AND HE HAD </p><p>"NO ENEMIES EXCEPT THE QADHAFI REGIME". </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  OUR SOURCE CLAIMED THAT ABU ZEID HAD RECENTLY </p><p>RECEIVED THREATENING PHONE CALLS AND HAD MOVED HIS </p><p>FAMILY WITHIN THE LAST TEN DAYS.  HE HAD TOLD FRIENDS </p><p>THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HIM, LIBYAN SECURITY </p><p>OFFICIALS WERE TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.  LIBYAN </p><p>OPPOSITIONISTS WERE CONVINCED ABU ZEID HAD BEEN TARGETED </p><p>PRECISELY BECAUSE HE WAS WELL-KNOWN AND WIDELY LIKED AND </p><p>THUS HIS MURDER, PARTICULARLY WHEN CARRIED OUT IN SUCH A </p><p>BRUTAL FASHION, WOULD HAVE A DEEPLY CHILLING EFFECT ON </p><p>LIBYAN EXPATRIATES EVERYWHERE. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  SCOTLAND YARD WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FOLLOW ANY LEAD </p><p>SUGGESTING A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED CRIME.  POST WILL </p><p>REPORT ANY INDICATION OF OFFICIAL LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>THE MURDER OF ABU ZEID. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CROWE </p><p></p></div>
