<p>UNCLAS THE HAGUE 001959 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>State for EB/ESC/ESP, S/CT, EUR/ERA, EUR/WE, EUR/UBI, INR/EC </p><p> </p><p>Treasury for Aufhauser, Zarate, Fox </p><p> </p><p>Justie for OIA/Friedman </p><p> </p><p>Brussels also for Legatt </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958 N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETTC, PTER, SP, NL, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE: ETA YOUTH DEMONSTRATE IN </p><p>AMSTERDAM DESPITE EU DESIGNATION </p><p> </p><p>1.  The Basque youth movement Segi held a small </p><p>demonstration in the Netherlands this weekend despite its </p><p>being designated by the EU as a terrorist organization </p><p>"internal" to Europe and by the Dutch government under its </p><p>national sanctions law as a group with whom financial </p><p>transactions are prohibited and accounts blocked.  Segi held </p><p>demonstrations and information evenings in Nijmegen and </p><p>Amsterdam on Saturday, August 2.  On Sunday, it demonstrated </p><p>at the prison in Alphen aan de Rijn, where alleged ETA </p><p>activist Alexander Akarregi is awaiting extradition to </p><p>Spain.  The demonstrations occurred without incidents. </p><p> </p><p>2.  The Amsterdam Public Prosecutors Office said that it </p><p>could take no action to stop the demonstration under the </p><p>Dutch sanctions law unless the group was receiving financial </p><p>contributions.  The Dutch also investigated whether it could </p><p>take action against individuals who may have accepted </p><p>financial transactions from the group in return for goods </p><p>and services.  Dutch authorities could make no case because </p><p>the demonstrators traveled here by minibus from Spain and </p><p>lodged in squatters\' housing.  Thus, the only expenses the </p><p>demonstrators incurred in the  Netherlands were for small </p><p>purchases of food and gasoline - transactions that would be </p><p>difficult to prosecute. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Some political leaders, Christian Democratic MP Camille </p><p>Eurlings and Liberal Party floorleader in the Amsterdam city </p><p>council Frits Huffnagel, criticized the "lenient" attitude </p><p>of the Dutch prosecutor\'s office.   "The meeting in </p><p>Amsterdam should have been discouraged by way of making </p><p>clear that Segi is not welcome here," said Eurlings.  "I </p><p>plan on asking the government how the prosecutor\'s office\'s </p><p>position tallies with the government\'s intention to ban </p><p>organizations listed on the EU list."  Huffnagel opined that </p><p>the meeting should have been banned.  "If it had been a </p><p>meeting of the youth organization of the Flemish Bloc, they </p><p>certainly would have taken action.  Now that it is a leftist </p><p>group, all kinds of legal obstacles are suddenly raised." </p><p> </p><p>Russel </p><p></p></div>
