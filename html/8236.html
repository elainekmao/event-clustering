<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 KATHMANDU 000961 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/22/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, NP, Political Parties </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  KING KEEPS PARTIES AT BAY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 0942 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 0814 </p><p>     C. KATHMANDU 0684 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS.   REASON:  1.5 (B,D). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) His public and private statements of support for the </p><p>principle of multiparty democracy notwithstanding, King </p><p>Gyanendra continues to hold mainstream political parties at </p><p>arm\'s length.  Contrary to recent widespread expectations, he </p><p>has taken no visible steps to form an all-party government. </p><p>Instead, Cabinet ministers have continued--presumably with </p><p>royal sanction--to criticize the behavior and past </p><p>performance of party leaders.  The political parties, </p><p>meanwhile, remain unable to shape a persuasive argument for </p><p>their inclusion in an interim Cabinet or a coordinated </p><p>political platform, and their joint protests so far have </p><p>attracted scant popular support.  Political and diplomatic </p><p>contacts are uncertain why the King continues to resist </p><p>making an overture to the parties.  Some sources suggest that </p><p>Maoist insurgents may have told the Palace that they will </p><p>break off dialogue if an all-party government is appointed. </p><p>Alternatively, the King may believe that the ceasefire and an </p><p>ongoing anti-corruption campaign (septel) are gaining him </p><p>sufficient popular good will to put off dealing with the </p><p>parties for the time being.  Long-standing mutual distrust </p><p>between the parties and the Palace is undoubtedly a factor as </p><p>well.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>PARTIES\' PROLONGED "JOINT STIR" </p><p>CAUSES LITTLE COMMOTION </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Five mainstream political parties continued their </p><p>combined protest program, or "joint stir," for the third week </p><p>(Ref B) to little apparent avail. (Note:  The parties have </p><p>pledged to continue the protests until the Constitution is </p><p>"reactivated" by the appointment of an all-party interim </p><p>government with full executive authority.  End note.)  The </p><p>demonstrations have remained largely peaceful, although </p><p>police reportedly baton charged participants in a May 18 </p><p>protest in Kathmandu.  Although party officials routinely </p><p>declare each daily program a grand success, so far the </p><p>protests appear to have attracted little popular support or </p><p>participation beyond professional party activists and members </p><p>of affiliated student wings.  The Maoists have not taken part </p><p>publicly in any of the daily demonstrations, and the Maoist </p><p>student wing has been busy conducting its own independent </p><p>protest campaign against private schools.  (Note:  No </p><p>international schools have been targeted in this campaign. </p><p>End note.)  Despite their consecutive protests, the parties, </p><p>moreover, remain unable to articulate either a persuasive </p><p>public argument for their inclusion in an interim Cabinet or </p><p>a coordinated political platform. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>NO TEA, NO SYMPATHY </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The tepid turnout at their protest rallies is not the </p><p>only disappointment for the parties, however.  The leaders of </p><p>the largest political parties--as well as members of several </p><p>diplomatic missions, including the generally well-informed </p><p>Indians--were expecting, based on firm indications from </p><p>well-placed Palace sources, King Gyanendra to take steps to </p><p>form an all-party government in early May.  (Note:  Party </p><p>leaders in both the Communist Party of Nepal - United Marxist </p><p>Leninist and the Nepali Congress have indicated to us that </p><p>they were led to expect a similar development on at least two </p><p>previous occasions in December and February.  End note.) </p><p>Some of the leaders reportedly were told to expect an </p><p>invitation to a Palace "tea party" o/a May 2 (the vernacular </p><p>press was even reporting the invitations as faits accomplis) </p><p>in which the King was supposed to ask them to form a new </p><p>interim government.  Some party sources say that leaders of </p><p>the two largest parties had already agreed among themselves, </p><p>if asked, that UML Secretary Madhav Nepal would head the new </p><p>government.  Instead of the anticipated invitations to tea </p><p>and royal reconciliation, on May 2 the parties heard a </p><p>televised address by Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand </p><p>that chastised them for their poor performance over the past </p><p>twelve years of democracy.  The failure of the rumored </p><p>rapprochement to materialize as expected has only increased </p><p>the party leaders\' mistrust of the Palace. </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>WHY KEEP THE PARTIES OUT? </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>4.  (C)  Given the several occasions that the Palace has been </p><p>rumored to be on the brink of forming an all-party </p><p>government, and given the likely political and diplomatic </p><p>support for such a step, the question arises why nothing has </p><p>happened. (Note:  The King so far has never granted the </p><p>parties\' long-standing request for a joint meeting.  The </p><p>Prime Minister, on the other hand, continues to invite them </p><p>to all-party meetings--most recently on May 23--which they </p><p>consistently boycott in protest of the "unconstitutionality" </p><p>of his government.  End note.)  Citing the King\'s frequent </p><p>public statements of support for multi-party democracy and </p><p>his desire to remain no more than a constitutional monarch, a </p><p>UML source noted that there is no ostensible philosophical </p><p>difference between the King and the parties on how the </p><p>interim government should be constituted.  Moreover, being </p><p>left out in the cold for more than seven months has </p><p>transformed long-time rivals G.P. Koirala, head of the Nepali </p><p>Congress, and Madhav Nepal, leader of the UML, into </p><p>temporary, if unlikely, allies, thereby belying the King\'s </p><p>original justification for bypassing the parties--their </p><p>inability to agree on a single candidate. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  One theory holds that the Maoists, whose strategy </p><p>appears to hinge on keeping the parties and the Palace </p><p>divided, may have secretly told the Palace that they will not </p><p>negotiate with an all-party government.  In particular, the </p><p>Maoists are widely believed to oppose a government led by the </p><p>UML, which they consider a rival for leftist support.  Since </p><p>the members of the current interim Cabinet were all </p><p>hand-picked by the King and are widely assumed to work in </p><p>close consultation with him, the Maoists may reason that </p><p>negotiating with the current Cabinet is the closest they can </p><p>get to negotiating directly with the King.  The Palace may be </p><p>unwilling to jeopardize the little progress made to date </p><p>toward dialogue with the insurgents by introducing a less </p><p>predictable, less pliable, and more partisan Cabinet at </p><p>mid-stream.  Both the Government of Nepal (GON) and the </p><p>Maoists may have decided, some believe, that retaining the </p><p>Chand Cabinet during the negotiations is the simplest </p><p>alternative available, at least for the near term. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Most political sources, however, believe the King has </p><p>not brought the parties on board because he wants a more </p><p>active role in governing.  Sources who knew the monarch as a </p><p>businessman describe him as a "hands-on" manager, unlikely to </p><p>be content with the detached role and circumscribed powers of </p><p>his late brother.  These sources interpret several of the </p><p>King\'s moves since October, including a royal ordinance </p><p>limiting government oversight of the Palace budget; the </p><p>appointment of Sharad Chandra Shah, a notorious anti-democrat </p><p>from the autocratic Panchayat era as advisor to the PM; the </p><p>PM\'s uncompromising, critical speech of May 2; and the recent </p><p>anti-corruption drive (septel) as virtual "in-your-face" </p><p>challenges to the parties, and thus evidence of this </p><p>purported ambition. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The King may also believe that he is better able to </p><p>address the many challenges besetting Nepal than the feckless </p><p>democratic leaders.  He could argue that he has been able to </p><p>respond to the two most pressing public concerns--peace and </p><p>corruption--by securing a ceasefire, resuming dialogue with </p><p>the Maoists, and initiating an intensive anti-corruption </p><p>campaign (septel).  In addition, the GON can point with pride </p><p>to a number of reforms (many of which were initiated, </p><p>however, under earlier democratic governments) that have </p><p>earned it high praise--and increased levels of funding--from </p><p>international financial institutions (Ref A).  Adding to his </p><p>confidence may be the parties\' failure so far to generate </p><p>greater public support for their protests, contrasted with </p><p>the relatively large (if equally stage-managed) reception to </p><p>his own public appearances (Ref C). </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) There are a number of plausible reasons why the King </p><p>has not yet made an overture to include the parties. </p><p>Possible Maoist objection to an all-party government, coupled </p><p>with the precarious nature of the peace process, may be the </p><p>most persuasive.  The absence of public indignation (and, in </p><p>some quarters, the appearance of tacit support) at his </p><p>actions since dismissing the Deuba government on October 4 </p><p>may also influence his thinking.  But the number of rumored </p><p>false starts, in which the parties were apparently led to </p><p>believe an all-party government was imminent, is disturbing </p><p>and can only contribute to the atmosphere of debilitating </p><p>mutual distrust.  Inserting himself so near the forefront of </p><p>government operations also carries an implicit risk for the </p><p>King, making him more visibly responsible for both its </p><p>successes and failures.  Any lasting political resolution to </p><p>the insurgency will, moreover, require the support of the </p><p>political parties.  The King should enlist the support of all </p><p>the legal and democratic forces--including the all-too-often </p><p>difficult and intractable political parties--in the GON </p><p>effort to craft a workable resolution to the conflict.  Some </p><p>contacts tell us that the King is torn by conflicting advice </p><p>within the Palace, but his current lack of initiative may </p><p>prove to be a regrettable squandering of political </p><p>opportunity. </p><p>BOGGS </p><p></p></div>
