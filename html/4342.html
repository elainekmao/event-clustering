Erdogan will meet with TGS Chief </p><p>General Ozkok Friday afternoon.  Papers remind that the </p><p>"caretaker" Prime Minister appointed by Sezer will remain in </p><p>office until Erdogan enters the parliament via by-elections </p><p>before March.  Papers see AKP deputy chairman Abdullah Gul </p><p>as the strongest candidate for the post of Prime Minister. </p><p>Erdogan is due to travel to the TRNC this weekend, and will </p><p>commence his European tour next week. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: Dailies report that UN Secretary General Annan has </p><p>sent a letter to Cypriot leaders Denktas and Clerides, </p><p>urging them to compromise before the EU Copenhagen Summit, </p><p>and advising them to discuss `details of secondary </p><p>importance\' in February.  TGS Chief General Ozkok said </p><p>Turkey would not allow developments that would threaten </p><p>peace and tranquility in Cyprus, reports say.  Ozkok warned </p><p>that Greek Cypriots\' EU accession would harm peace and </p><p>stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.  "Cumhuriyet" </p><p>carries an extensive front-page article about TGS concerns </p><p>about the  Cyprus plan: TGS believes that territorial </p><p>concessions expected from the Turkish side are too big, that </p><p>the settlement of Greek Cypriots in Turkish territory will </p><p>gradually transform Cyprus into a Greek Cypriot island, and </p><p>that the displacement of about 80,000 Turkish Cypriots will </p><p>damage the social and economic structure of the island, </p><p>Cumhuriyet stresses.  In a last minute `hawkish struggle,\' </p><p>outgoing Foreign Minister Gurel strongly criticized the UN </p><p>Cyprus plan, saying that aspects of the plan dealing with </p><p>territory and the return of displaced Cypriots were </p><p>unacceptable, papers report.  Gurel blamed the UN for </p><p>allegedly preparing the plan together with the Greek </p><p>Cypriots.  "Sabah" finds such as  intervention by the </p><p>outgoing government to be unacceptable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Dailies report that the international community was </p><p>`temporarily relieved\' by Saddam Hussein\'s unconditional </p><p>acceptance of UNSC Resolution 1441 for arms inspection in </p><p>Iraq.  Papers report the UN inspection team headed by Hans </p><p>Blix will go to Baghad on Monday to begin the `largest </p><p>weapons inspection operation in history.\'  Two Turkish </p><p>officers will take part in the delegation, reports say. </p><p>Meanwhile, dailies report that visiting Northern Iraqi </p><p>Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Talabani was </p><p>unable to get an appointment with AKP leader Erdogan and CHP </p><p>leader Baykal.  "Cumhuriyet" reports  that KDP leader </p><p>Barzani has turned down Ankara\'s invitation for </p><p>consultations, saying he had a pre-scheduled program in </p><p>Syria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Pearson on TDN: The English daily Turkish Daily </p><p>News (TDN) carries an op-ed by the U.S. Ambassador to </p><p>Ankara, Robert Pearson on U.S.-Turkey relations.  In his </p><p>article `American-Turkish relations after November 3: </p><p>Continuity and partnership,\'  Ambassador Pearson briefly </p><p>outlines the evolution of bilateral relations, and discussed </p><p>the key policy issues for Turkey such as the EU, Cyprus, </p><p>Iraq, political and economic reforms, and human rights. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Cyprus Peace Plan </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Kofi Annan\'s Cyprus Plan" </p><p>Kamuran Ozbir wrote in nationalist Ortadogu (11/15): </p><p>"Sources close to diplomatic circles tell us that the </p><p>initial evaluation of Kofi Annan\'s Cyprus plan was deemed </p><p>positive, particularly because of its recognition of the </p><p>Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  There are, however, </p><p>certain elements which cause serious concern, such as </p><p>territorial concessions, property issues, and demographic </p><p>movements.  . It seems that the Turkish Foreign Ministry </p><p>will have to conduct a comprehensive study of the plan, </p><p>which might take at least a couple of days, and leave the </p><p>matter for a final decision at the upcoming National </p><p>Security Council meeting at the end of November." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Style is important on the Cyprus issue" </p><p>Ferai Tinc wrote in mass appeal Hurriyet (11/15): "The </p><p>current situation calls for a diplomatic juggling act.  . </p><p>The upcoming Copenhagen summit is not only going to evaluate </p><p>the Cyprus situation in light of current developments, but </p><p>also make more binding decisions for Turkey.  The EU\'s </p><p>Accession Partnership Document clearly draws a direct link </p><p>between Turkey\'s EU process and Cyprus issue. . We do not </p><p>mean to say `let\'s give away Cyprus and get rid of this </p><p>issue.\'  Yet we don\'t have to reject efforts for a </p><p>settlement with crude rhetoric either.  The Turkish side </p><p>should announce its readiness to negotiate the Annan plan." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What is Ankara\'s position?" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (11/15): "There are </p><p>certain parts to which the Turkish side would object, such </p><p>as the territorial concessions and demographic movements. </p><p>Yet the plan, very positively, verifies the equality and </p><p>sovereignty of the two sides -- something that we have been </p><p>working for years to achieve.  Now is the time to think </p><p>realistically and act pragmatically.  Rejection of the plan </p><p>will definitely work against the interests of Turkey as well </p><p>as Turkish Cypriots." </p><p></p></div>
