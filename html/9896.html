<p>UNCLAS  ROME 003542 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR NSF REP SCHINDEL </p><p>DEPT FOR OES/STC AND STAS, EUR/WE </p><p> </p><p>FOR OES/IHA JKAUFMAN/TGALLAGHER </p><p>WHITE HOUSE FOR OSTP </p><p>USDOC FOR TA MILLICK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: TSPL, KSCA, TBIO, IT, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: US-ITALY HEALTH COOPERATION:  A 25 MILLION DOLLAR </p><p>UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary.  The US and Italy have long shared strong </p><p>medical and health research collaborations, but this </p><p>relationship has expanded and deepened in the last year. On </p><p>April 17, Health Minister Sirchia and Secretary of Health </p><p>and Human Services Thompson signed in Rome a Memorandum of </p><p>Understanding, focused on rare diseases, oncology, and </p><p>responses to bioterrorism. The MOU was amplified by the </p><p>signing of a technical annex in Washington, last June. The </p><p>Italian contribution will be up to 17.5 million USD. A </p><p>Letter of Intent between NIH and the Superior Institute of </p><p>Health (ISS) signed on July 28, opened the cooperation to a </p><p>broad range of diseases, including cardiovascular and </p><p>neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson\'s and </p><p>Alzheimer\'s.  The Italian contribution will be about 7.5 </p><p>million USD.  Making new Italian commitments worth some USD </p><p>25 million.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  To overcome its lack of R and D funds, the GOI included </p><p>in the 2003 Budget law a provision for a 20-cent increase in </p><p>cigarette prices.  In this way, the GOI would collect about </p><p>435 million Euro and fund health research and universities. </p><p>The price increase began last March, and the GOI has </p><p>allocated funds to both national and international research </p><p>programs and cooperation. The first GOI health priority has </p><p>been to fund the US-Italy collaboration. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>HHS Secretary Thompson and MOH Sirchia MOU </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3.  On April 17, Health Minister Sirchia and Secretary of </p><p>Health and Human Services Thompson signed in Rome a </p><p>Memorandum of Understanding.  This agreement focused on rare </p><p>diseases, oncology, and responses to bioterrorism. To </p><p>further define work programs pursuant to the implementation </p><p>of MOU, US and Italian health experts met during the seventh </p><p>biennial review of the US-Italian Agreement on Scientific </p><p>and Technological Cooperation, June 17-18. The experts </p><p>concurred on the elaboration of two (Rare Diseases, and </p><p>Bioterrorism Preparedness) out of three topics included in </p><p>the MOU.  The third topic - Oncology - was discussed by Min. </p><p>Sirchia and Dr. Andrew Von Eschenbach, director of the </p><p>National Cancer Institute, in Milan on June 16. Those </p><p>discussions produced a Technical Annex, which was signed by </p><p>HHS Secretary Thompson and Health Minister Sirchia on June </p><p>23 in Washington. </p><p> </p><p>4.  In particular, the two sides agreed to exchange </p><p>information on programs and activities, exchange scientists, </p><p>provide and strengthen research training including </p><p>standardization of guidelines, and identify opportunities </p><p>for collaborative research consistent with the peer reviewed </p><p>scientific application process of both countries. Research </p><p>areas of particular interest included the development of new </p><p>or improved diagnostic tests, drugs, vaccines and other </p><p>prevention products, clinical trials and epidemiology </p><p>research. The following amounts have been identified by the </p><p>Italian side for the three topic areas: oncology, 10 million </p><p>USD; rare diseases, 5 million USD; and, bioterrorism </p><p>preparedness, 2.5 million USD. </p><p> </p><p>5.  On June 25 and 26, Dr. Joe Harford, National Cancer </p><p>Institute Director for International Affairs continued </p><p>discussion with Minister Sirchia and Italian cancer experts </p><p>to further develop a bilateral research plan on Oncology </p><p>issues. It was decided to organize a bilateral technical </p><p>meeting on Pharmacogenomics on July 30-31 in Bethesda. </p><p>President of the Superior Institute of Health (ISS) Prof. </p><p>Enrico Garaci led the Italian team. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>NIH-ISS Letter of Intent </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>6.  Last May, during his visit to the US, Prof. Enrico </p><p>Garaci, President of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita\' (ISS) </p><p>agreed in principle on a research cooperation agreement with </p><p>NIH Director Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni.   The agreement - a non- </p><p>binding Letter of Intent - has been strongly supported by </p><p>Congressman and House Appropriations Chairman Bill Young. </p><p>Taking advantage of CODEL Young\'s visit to Rome, Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister Fini and U/S Letta hosted the signature </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ceremony at Palazzo Chigi on July 28. Several Italian </p><p>ministers - Sirchia, Tremonti (Treasury), Tremaglia </p><p>(Italians Abroad), and Urso (Foreign Trade) - and </p><p>Congressman Young and his entire delegation attended. </p><p> </p><p>7.  The Letter opened the cooperation to a broad range of </p><p>diseases, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative </p><p>diseases, like Parkinson\'s and Alzheimer\'s. The cooperation </p><p>will also focus on vaccine development, especially for </p><p>HIV/AIDS. The Italian contribution will be about 7.5 million </p><p>USD.  Note.  The US and Italy are the two largest </p><p>contributors to the Global Fund - the Fund to fight AIDS, </p><p>Malaria and Tuberculosis.  This bilateral cooperation in </p><p>vaccine development is a logical extension of, and a </p><p>complement to, the broader international effort through the </p><p>Global Fund, and to president Bush\'s new initiative to </p><p>combat HIV/AIDS in Africa.  End note. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Potential for a joint US-Italy Bone Marrow Registry </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  During a visit to Rome by Congressman Young and his </p><p>staff in spring 2002, the possibility of linking the US and </p><p>Italian national bone marrow registries was suggested as a </p><p>further means of health cooperation between Italy and the </p><p>US.  This linkage would allow each country to have instant </p><p>access to the other\'s registry.  The current system involves </p><p>Italian officials faxing a request for a donor, a search is </p><p>performed on the U.S. registry, and then a response is sent </p><p>back to Italy with a match. </p><p> </p><p>9.  during the July 2003 visit of Chairman Young, and to </p><p>facilitate this new venture, Embassy contacted the National </p><p>Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), which referred us to Captain </p><p>Robert Hartzman of the US Navy Medical Command and Director </p><p>of the C.W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Program. On July 28, </p><p>Capt. Hartzman, a member of the Congressman Young\'s </p><p>delegation, and Dr. Alessandro Nanni-Costa, head of the </p><p>National Organ Transplantation Center at ISS, met to discuss </p><p>the potential for the joint registry and how to move forward </p><p>on the project.  They agreed to create a working group </p><p>comprised of the staff from the Italian Bone Marrow Registry </p><p>(IBMR) in Genova, members of ISS, the NMDP staff, and </p><p>himself in order to facilitate the best solution for Italy </p><p>in this endeavor.  Dr. Nanni-Costa also announced that ISS </p><p>would be actively involved in this new venture and would </p><p>send a representative to Genova to work with the Registry. </p><p>The two sides agreed that the next step would be a meeting </p><p>between the two registries, themselves, sometime in the fall </p><p>of 2003.  Capt. Hartzman and Dr. Nanni-Costa will be the </p><p>points of contact and facilitators for this meeting. </p><p> </p><p>10.  Comment:  It\'s unusual for Italy, with chronic under- </p><p>funding of research, to fund USD 25 million for new </p><p>cooperation.  The choice of the US is one more clear signal </p><p>of the importance of the US to Italy, and the high quality </p><p>of medical research in both countries.  It\'s a good </p><p>partnership, and well worth strengthening.  End comment. </p><p>Sembler </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p>	2003ROME03542 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
