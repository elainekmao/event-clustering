At least 29 students </p><p>are reported dead, and 98 are still under the rubble where a </p><p>dormitory building housing primary school children </p><p>collapsed.  Initial reports said cries of children could be </p><p>heard from beneath the shattered masonry.  All dailies were </p><p>in furious agreement that the high death toll was the </p><p>outcome of a crime committed by `politicians, bureaucrats </p><p>and contractors\' who have allowed unlawful construction. </p><p>"Radikal" says the boarding school was constructed as an </p><p>`election bribe\' in 1994.  "Hurriyet" compares the </p><p>`contractor\'s crime\' that killed many primary school </p><p>children to the 1995 bomb attack in Oklahoma which has </p><p>claimed 168 lives.  In a striking front page layout, the </p><p>paper displays photos of rescuers carrying children out of </p><p>the rubble of the Oklahoma attack and Bingol quake, </p><p>stressing that the results have been exactly the same.  The </p><p>paper also reminds that Timothy McVeigh was executed in the </p><p>States two years ago.  The theme equates the </p><p>contractors/politician with terrorists - same results. </p><p>Greece has been among the first countries to extend a </p><p>helping hand to Turkey by sending 300,000 Euros and a 25 </p><p>strong rescue team to Turkey, reports note.  Broadcasters </p><p>said on Friday morning that Cochairman of Turkey, U.S. </p><p>Caucus, Robert Wexler has applied to the Congress to </p><p>consider disaster aid for Turkey. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: Dailies echo President Bush\'s remarks announcing the </p><p>`end of major conflicts,\' and the `beginning of </p><p>reconstruction\' in Iraq.  Reports cite "Newsweek" that Bush </p><p>was intending to assign former State Department official </p><p>Paul Bremer, a close friend of Secretary Rumsfeld, to </p><p>administer post-war Iraq.  Papers also quote U.S. Assistant </p><p>Secretary of Commerce Grant Aldonas as denying reports that </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Turkish companies would be given no deals in Iraq\'s </p><p>reconstruction.  Aldonas said Turkish firms offering </p><p>suitable prices with high quality service guarantees would </p><p>stand a chance to grab a share as subcontractors, papers </p><p>note.  Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of Treasury John Snow said </p><p>the American grant of $1 billion for Turkey would be </p><p>conditioned to Ankara\'s adherence to the IMF economic </p><p>program.  Ankara prefers the grant to be freed of IMF </p><p>conditions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish giants hopeful of Iraqi market: Turkey\'s leading </p><p>business group, Koc Holding Group of Companies\' owner Rahmi </p><p>Koc said U.S. and British giants would extend business </p><p>opportunities to Turkish companies in reconstruction of </p><p>Iraq, "Milliyet" says.  Koc said his group would get some </p><p>construction jobs through its partner the British Balfour </p><p>Beatty Co.  He added that Ezcacibasi Corp., Turkey\'s leading </p><p>pharmaceutical  firm could sell medicine to Iraq at lower </p><p>prices than U.S. and UK. Firms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. Istanbul Consulate compound for lease: "Hurriyet" says </p><p>that the U.S. Consulate building in Istanbul would be sold </p><p>or rented after the Consulate staff moves to its newly built </p><p>compound in Istinye.  There are many private companies and </p><p>institutions interested in the historical complex, but </p><p>contrary to press reports ("Milliyet" focusing on a group of </p><p>anti-war intellectuals protesting accepting a donation from </p><p>America in light of the looting of cultural treasures in </p><p>Iraq) on Thursday, Americans were not planning to donate it </p><p>to the Istanbul Arts and Culture Foundation, and that the </p><p>decision would be made by the U.S. State Department, the </p><p>paper underlines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ONW `nearing end\': Operation Northern Watch (ONW) </p><p>reconnaissance flights  operated from Incirlik AB to </p><p>Northern Iraq since the First Gulf War in 1991.  ONW was </p><p>"deactivated" with a ceremony held at the base on Thursday. </p><p>In attendance were Turkey\'s Air Force Commander Gen. Cumhur </p><p>Asparuk and U.S. EUCOM Vice Commander Gen. Charles Wald, </p><p>"Radikal" reports.  Gen. Wald reportedly said 1400 of the </p><p>14,500 troops will remain in the base, indicating Incirlik </p><p>will go back to its pre-1991 status. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>`Kurds at the table, Turkomans excluded\': "Cumhuriyet" </p><p>reports that the Turkomans were left out of the group </p><p>convoked by the U.S. in Baghdad to establish an interim </p><p>government for Iraq.  Iraqi Turkoman Front (ITF) complained </p><p>that the Turkoman have been offered one seat instead of the </p><p>expected six at the committee set up for Kirkuk\'s </p><p>administration.  Cumhuriyet worte that the ITC complained </p><p>that Kurds have occupied many Turkoman zones including </p><p>Kirkuk, attempting to annex it to the illegal Kurdish </p><p>administration set up in Irbil and Sulaimanija. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>a) Middle East Roadmap </p><p>b)   Restructuring Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Middle East peace" </p><p>Erdal Guven wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal (5/2): </p><p>"The US is very determined not to see a repeat of any 9/11 </p><p>type events. Thus the roadmap for the Middle East is one of </p><p>efforts to prevent this from happening.  The Bush </p><p>administration formed a Palestine leadership, which is </p><p>supposed to comprehend as well as implement the peace plan. </p><p>The naming of a new Palestinian PM as well as the isolation </p><p>of Arafat are all part of this effort. . However, Arafat\'s </p><p>isolation is not sufficient to bring peace because there are </p><p>some other important obstacles, such as Palestinian </p><p>fundamentalist organizations and right wing Israeli </p><p>political parties. . The concerned parties that are supposed </p><p>to take action based on the roadmap are not providing strong </p><p>hopes for the future either.  Mahmoud Abbas is regarded as a </p><p>US puppet and is not viewed as a strong leader by the </p><p>Palestinians.  As for Sharon, there is no need even to </p><p>repeat the list of question marks about him. . The plan </p><p>draws a basic framework, yet it fails to provide guidance </p><p>for the settlement of the major issues, such as the </p><p>Jerusalem issue, ultimate borders and the fate of </p><p>Palestinian refugees.  The peace in the Middle East is once </p><p>again is a very tough mission to accomplish." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What type of regime in Iraq?" </p><p>Sami Kohen noted in mass appeal Milliyet (5/2): "As declared </p><p>by President Bush, the military operation part of the Iraq </p><p>war has ended.  It is now time to rebuild Iraq.  The US won </p><p>this war rather easily. However as Americans also </p><p>acknowledge, winning the peace might be a more difficult </p><p>mission to achieve.  In this new period, the US has set </p><p>three main targets for success.  The first is to establish </p><p>peace and security in Iraq.  The second is to revitalize </p><p>Iraq\'s economy and infrastructure.  The third is to </p><p>revitalize Iraq\'s political system, in other words, to </p><p>establish a democratic regime, which will unite the people </p><p>of Iraq. . Regarding the very last part of the mission, </p><p>which is the most difficult one, we keep hearing different </p><p>tunes from the US officials.  Is Washington really going to </p><p>accept an Islamic regime in Iraq if it turns out to be the </p><p>choice of the masses?  That is the main issue to answer. </p><p>Jay Garner is saying that the US will not impose any type of </p><p>regime and will respect the people\'s decision.  However, </p><p>some other US administration officials, including Secretary </p><p>Rumsfeld, state that the US will not allow an Iranian style </p><p>regime in Iraq." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
