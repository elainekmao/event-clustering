<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 000808 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLAD AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: ARINC FLEXING PARLIAMENT\'S MUSCLES </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 8252 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 7682 </p><p>     C. ANKARA 8873 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by PolCouns John Kunstadter.  Reason: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The growing popular desire in Turkey for </p><p>comprehensive, systemic change and a more open society gives </p><p>Parliament, under leadership of AK Party heavyweight Bulent </p><p>Arinc, room to assert itself and its constitutional </p><p>prerogatives.  In principle the process should be a boon to </p><p>democratization.  At the same time, partly owing to the </p><p>inexperience of the large majority of M.P.\'s, it is likely to </p><p>promote strains among leading AK figures and complicate GOT </p><p>decision making.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>The Old Paradigm </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) As in western parliamentary democracies, Turkey\'s </p><p>Parliament has the formal power to make law and declare war. </p><p>Nevertheless, parliamentary primacy in Ankara has long been </p><p>figurative.  Real power traditionally has been exercised </p><p>largely through a network of enduring, if informal, </p><p>arrangements and relationships so ubiquitous as to confound </p><p>the formal governing process.  Indeed, historically, Turkey\'s </p><p>Kemalist state apparatus, laws that perpetuate a top-down </p><p>political party structure, and the natural Turkish cultural </p><p>tendency toward authoritarianism all too often have vitiated </p><p>not only the role of Parliament but the power of elected </p><p>civilians to make decisions on national security and other </p><p>policy issues (refs A, B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>AK\'s Rise -- and Parliament\'s? </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The growing popular desire for comprehensive, systemic </p><p>change and a more open society -- reflected both in </p><p>widespread support for EU membership and the landslide Nov. 3 </p><p>election victory of the Justice and Development (AK) Party -- </p><p>opens the way for Parliament to reassert its constitutional </p><p>prerogatives.  AK came to power not only as the first </p><p>single-party government in 15 years.  Replacing the </p><p>fragmented legislatures of previous years, AK controls an </p><p>overwhelming parliamentary majority of 362 (of 550) </p><p>legislative seats, just short of a majority sufficient to </p><p>amend the constitution and far outstripping the opposition </p><p>pro-Establishment Republican People\'s Party (CHP), with 177 </p><p>seats.  Numerous AK contacts have described to us their </p><p>intentions of promoting Parliament as an "independent" actor </p><p>and as the ultimate repository of the national will. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>The Arinc Factor </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The most vigorous proponent of Parliament\'s primacy is </p><p>its ambitious Speaker, Bulent Arinc.  An AK heavyweight, </p><p>Arinc was not the choice of either AK Chairman Erdogan or </p><p>P.M. Gul, who preferred more nondescript and </p><p>non-confrontational figures for the job.  Rather than </p><p>allowing himself to be bypassed, however, Arinc muscled his </p><p>way into the post by promoting his own candidacy and drawing </p><p>on his own considerable support among the AK grassroots and </p><p>more ideological elements of the Parliamentary Group.  While </p><p>Erdogan, Gul, and Arinc profess to be working together -- and </p><p>share the same overall commitment to AK policy goals -- the </p><p>manner of Arinc\'s election as Parliament President has </p><p>established him as a force to be reckoned with.  AK </p><p>Parliamentary Group leaders assert to us that as Speaker, </p><p>Arinc has left day-to-day AK affairs behind him. </p><p>Nevertheless, they laud him both as a comrade and as a </p><p>promoter of Parliament\'s interests and responsibilities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Arinc is rhetorically reaffirming the Speaker\'s </p><p>traditional role above the fray of partisan politics, partly </p><p>to demonstrate his independence from Erdogan and Gul.  Even </p><p>so, he is using his position as a bully pulpit to promote his </p><p>ideological and personal power interests in ways that have </p><p>generated considerable controversy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Shortly after assuming office, Arinc took the highly </p><p>symbolic step of having his headscarf-clad wife join him to </p><p>see off President Sezer on a mid-November trip abroad, </p><p>prompting mainstream criticism of Arinc and AK for allegedly </p><p>promoting an "anti-secularist" agenda and bringing to the </p><p>fore ideological issues that Erdogan and Gul had hoped to </p><p>downplay early on (ref C).  With Sezer out of town, Arinc </p><p>received Speaker Hastert in the Presidential Palace, </p><p>emphasizing his role as "Acting President." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Arinc has publicly offered the cryptic comment that he </p><p>"will not support the mistakes of Erdogan," a criticism </p><p>apparently designed to show the voters that he (unlike P.M. </p><p>Gul) is not beholden to the AK Chairman.  Arinc\'s January </p><p>visit to northern Cyprus, according to several contacts, was </p><p>not coordinated with either Erdogan or the Gul government. </p><p>Arinc is now expressing support for "TRNC President" Denktas </p><p>even as AK and Erdogan publicly take Denktas, his cronies, </p><p>and the Turkish Establishment to task for promoting </p><p>corruption on the island and foot-dragging in the UN Cyprus </p><p>talks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The effort by the Arinc-led Parliament to assert </p><p>itself is likely to have considerable impact on USG equities </p><p>here.  A stronger Parliament would be a boon for </p><p>democratization, and could help break down the life-and-death </p><p>control of party leaders over their subordinates -- a </p><p>process, already underway in AK, which accounts in part for </p><p>AK\'s "multi-headed" government (septel).  A more assertive </p><p>Parliament will help redress the perceived imbalance between </p><p>the State -- unelected bureaucrats and others long accustomed </p><p>to wielding nearly independent power -- and elected civilians </p><p>by promoting responsibility and accountability in the </p><p>political class.  However, the new Parliament is full of </p><p>inexperienced legislators whose ability to handle the rigors </p><p>of legislative action is questionable.  And to the extent the </p><p>current Parliament breaks with the rubber-stamp practices </p><p>traditionally associated with Turkish legislative activity, </p><p>it will also promote strains among AK\'s leading figures -- </p><p>particularly Erdogan, Arinc, and Gul -- and thus complicate </p><p>GOT decision making. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
