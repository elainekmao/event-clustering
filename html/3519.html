<p>S E C R E T HARARE 001874 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE DEPORTS LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: political section chief Matt Harrington. </p><p>Reasons: 1.5 (B) and (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) According to almost identical press reports in both </p><p>the state-owned "Herald" and the independent "Daily News," </p><p>the Zimbabwean government deported prominent Libyan resident </p><p>Yousef Murgham on August 15 for engaging in (unspecified) </p><p>activities that posed a threat to national security.  Murgham </p><p>was escorted under the heavy guard of  Central Intelligence </p><p>Organization (CIO) agents to Harare International Airport and </p><p>placed aboard an Air Zimbabwe flight bound for Nairobi, and </p><p>he was expected to catch connecting flights to Cairo and </p><p>Tripoli.  CIO officers apparently prevented Murgham\'s wife </p><p>from serving the escorts with a copy of a High Court order </p><p>preventing the deportation.  The state-controlled daily </p><p>described Murgham as a former intelligence officer at the </p><p>Libyan embassy from 1986 until the early 1990\'s who still </p><p>"was using the cover of contacts he made within the ruling </p><p>ZANU-PF party and Government while a diplomat."  According to </p><p>the same article, Murgham\'s relationship with the Libyan </p><p>ambassador was "frosty."  His Zimbabwean wife, Jean, told </p><p>journalists he had resigned from the Libyan government in </p><p>1993 but had preferred to remain in Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S) Comment: Murgham\'s activities as an intelligence </p><p>officer under non-official cover, and the internal GOZ </p><p>machinations which preceded the deportation, have been </p><p>well-documented in ORCA channels.  A relative of Libyan </p><p>leader Khadafy, Murgham has been the primary architect of the </p><p>close relationship between the Zimbabwean and Libyan </p><p>governments, as well as of closer Libyan relations with much </p><p>of southern Africa.  Khadafy\'s failure to stop in Zimbabwe </p><p>during his recent road trip through the region, on his return </p><p>from the African Union inauguration, was likely related to </p><p>the Murgham uncertainty.  It is noteworthy that the GOZ has </p><p>taken a step likely to irritate its benefactor in Tripoli, </p><p>and we are interested to see whether the deportation has a </p><p>deleterious impact on the warming Zimbabwe-Libya </p><p>relationship.  More context is available in ORCA channels. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
