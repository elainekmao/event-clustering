O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EINV, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: Haphazard Economic Reform </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: The GOZ\'s rigidly statist economic policy </p><p>has metamorphosed into a hodgepodge approach since </p><p>January.  Yet the Government still lacks commitment, </p><p>consensus and leadership to see through broad economic </p><p>liberalization. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>The Low Point </p><p>------------- </p><p>2. (U) Last November 14 was 9/11 for Zimbabwe\'s business </p><p>community.  Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa unveiled a </p><p>breathtakingly interventionist budget that: </p><p> </p><p>- controlled almost every retail price, often below </p><p>production cost. </p><p> </p><p>- reaffirmed the Grain Marketing Board (GMB)\'s monopoly </p><p>on maize. </p><p> </p><p>- taxed export revenue indirectly at over 90 percent. </p><p> </p><p>- made market-based currency trading illegal, shutting </p><p>down hundreds of exchange agencies. </p><p> </p><p>The budget alleviated none of the country\'s gaping </p><p>macroeconomic distortions.  Unable to secure a continued </p><p>supply of nearly free fuel from Libya, Zimbabwe was </p><p>marching rapidly toward economic meltdown by the year\'s </p><p>end. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Since January, however, GOZ moderates have </p><p>implemented a string of reform measures. The GOZ devalued </p><p>its still arbitrary official exchange rate from Z$ 55 to </p><p>824/US$, eliminated most indirect export taxes, reduced </p><p>its fuel subsidy from around 88 to 25 percent and began </p><p>to negotiate dollarized energy tariffs.  Last week the </p><p>GOZ loosened the GMB\'s control, permitting the free </p><p>barter of small maize quantities. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>4. (SBU) In spite of these overdue reforms, there is no </p><p>hint of economic revival.  With the recent arrival of </p><p>energy rationing, in fact, the economy has lurched closer </p><p>to meltdown. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Why no progress despite a positive policy shift? </p><p>First, reforms have been haphazard and narrow, probably </p><p>reflecting conflicting views within a GOZ that still </p><p>enforces unsustainable price controls and negative </p><p>interest rates.  Second, the GOZ has made no effort to </p><p>undo damage to the economy\'s infrastructure - i.e., rail </p><p>transport, coal extraction, power generation, steel </p><p>production, large-scale agriculture - so businesses now </p><p>contend with costly inefficiencies.  Third, the private </p><p>sector will not invest in an economy run by an unstable </p><p>and bumbling Government.  For example, the GOZ is so </p><p>inept at calculating revenue inflows that it raised the </p><p>leaded fuel price from Z$ 74 to 450 without dedicating </p><p>funds for the procurement of less-subsidized fuel, </p><p>gaining nothing but an enraged population.  Even when </p><p>trying, this GOZ does not appear up to the task of </p><p>leading Zimbabwe down a reform path. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
