<p>S E C R E T COLOMBO 000277 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 2-18-13 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PARM, PTER, ETTC, CE, MV </p><p>SUBJECT:  MANPADS:  Information for possible bilateral </p><p>discussions with Sri Lanka and the Maldives </p><p> </p><p>Ref:  State 36352 </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) Per Reftel, Mission\'s input for the request for </p><p>information on Man Portable Air Defense Systems </p><p>(MANPADS) follows.  Responses are keyed to the questions </p><p>in Reftel Paras 7-13. </p><p> </p><p>Sri Lanka </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>-- General Information:  To our knowledge, the </p><p>Sri Lankan military does not have any MANPADS.  The </p><p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is believed to </p><p>have SA-14s that were made in Bulgaria.  By law, all </p><p>weapons going into and leaving Sri Lanka must be </p><p>approved by the Ministry of Defense.  The LTTE </p><p>circumvents these laws on a regular basis by smuggling </p><p>arms into Sri Lanka. </p><p> </p><p>-- Government Cooperation:  Mission expects that the GSL </p><p>will cooperate with the USG on MANPADS issues.  (Note: </p><p>The GSL has allowed access to captured LTTE SA-14s in </p><p>the past and has requested US assistance in identifying </p><p>weapon origins.) The government\'s export control laws </p><p>appear to be adequate, but the GSL is unable to enforce </p><p>them re the LTTE. </p><p> </p><p>-- Feasible Arguments:  Mission believes the GSL would </p><p>be receptive to an approach based on the need for </p><p>responsible action to deal with MANPADS.  The GSL is </p><p>aware of the magnitude of the liability of an attack </p><p>against civil aviation using MANPADS.  (Note:  Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s international airport was attacked by the LTTE </p><p>in July 2001 and four of the national air carriers\' </p><p>aircraft were destroyed.  The nearby military airport </p><p>was also attacked, and many planes and helicopters were </p><p>destroyed in the incident.)  Mission believes that the </p><p>GSL would be responsive to any security-related approach </p><p>regarding control of access to MANPADS. </p><p> </p><p>-- Financial Incentives:  Mission believes this section </p><p>is not applicable.  The GSL is not known to have any </p><p>MANPADS and Mission believes the GSL would be responsive </p><p>to USG concerns on the issue because of its own national </p><p>interest in controlling access to MANPADS. </p><p> </p><p>-- Other Incentives:  Mission believes this section is </p><p>not applicable.  The GSL is not known to have any </p><p>MANPADS and Mission believes the GSL would be responsive </p><p>to USG concerns on the issues because of its own </p><p>national interest in controlling access to MANPADS. </p><p> </p><p>-- Government Contacts and Engagement Opportunities: </p><p>Mission can contact key Ministers in the GSL and key </p><p>individuals in the GSL\'s MFA and MoD on this issue.  GSL </p><p>interlocutors are available at the United Nations. </p><p>Mission recommends initiating any dialogue with the </p><p>government in Colombo, however. </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>Maldives </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Begin Text: </p><p> </p><p>-- General Information:  To our knowledge, the Maldivian </p><p>government does not have any MANPADS and would be </p><p>receptive to initiatives on controlling access to </p><p>MANPADS by the USG. </p><p> </p><p>-- (Note:  Mission believes the remaining sections are </p><p>not applicable to the Maldives.) </p><p> </p><p>End Text. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
