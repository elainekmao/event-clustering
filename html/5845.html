<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001092 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TRIBAL SHEIKHS JAILED FOR SADDAM-SPONSORED IRAQ </p><p>VISIT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GMP20030110000138 B. GMP20030203000056 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>SHEIKHS PAID BY BAGHDAD TO ACT AS "HUMAN SHIELDS" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) A delegation calling itself the League of Arab and </p><p>African tribes consisting of Jordanian "tribal sheikhs" </p><p>visited Baghdad in mid-January and pledged the group would </p><p>act as human shields in Iraq.  The visiting delegation was </p><p>well covered in Iraqi press (ref A), but were arrested upon </p><p>their return to Jordan (ref B). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Although several of the family names mentioned in the </p><p>press reports are associated with prominent tribes, none of </p><p>the individual tribe members are known to Post or have any </p><p>known position of authority within the tribe.  Two of the </p><p>family names mentioned in Ref B--al-Khaza\'ilah and </p><p>al-Ghuwayri--are part of the Bani Hassan tribe, the largest </p><p>tribe in Jordan and one with many tribal links in Iraq. </p><p>President of the Senate Zeid Rifai (please protect) told the </p><p>Ambassador on February 6 that Iraq paid the tribal members </p><p>roughly $50,000 each to go to Baghdad.  Rifai said all were </p><p>still being detained and that the GOJ is demanding that all </p><p>members turn over the money to the government. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) It is likely that we will see further attempts by Iraq </p><p>to influence major elements of Jordanian society--including </p><p>the tribes.  This attempt, however, attracted little </p><p>attention in Jordan and the "sheikhs" who participated will </p><p>likely be brought back in line by their tribes...once they </p><p>are released from jail. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
