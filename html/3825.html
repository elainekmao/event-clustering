<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 002763 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/27/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MOPS, MASS, NI, IV </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ROE FOR NIGERIAN FORCES IN COTE D\'IVOIRE </p><p> </p><p> Classified by DCM Andrews for reasons 1.5 (a), (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C/NF) DCM and POL/MILOFF met with the Minister of State </p><p>for Defense (Army) Malam Lawal Batagarawa morning of </p><p>September 27 to discuss ROE for NAF units in Cote d\'Ivoire. </p><p>Batagarawa seemed taken by surprise when told of the </p><p>deployment of three NAF Alpha Jets, two MI-35 attack </p><p>helicopters, weaponry and support personnel to Abidjan.  DCM </p><p>told Batagarawa that NSA Aliyu Mohammed had informed him of </p><p>the deployment on 25 September.  Batagarawa then said that </p><p>the MI-35s would assist with evacuation efforts and that the </p><p>Alpha Jets were there to provide air cover for them.  He then </p><p>said that the ROE directed NAF forces to act only in </p><p>self-defense and to take no other action without specific </p><p>authorization from the NCA in Abuja. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C/NF) DATT sources at the MOD, Defense Headquarters, </p><p>Nigerian DIA and NAF indicate that the orders to deploy the </p><p>NAF to Cote d\'Ivoire did not pass through Defense </p><p>Headquarters, but went straight to the NAF from the </p><p>Presidency.  These sources were unaware of the issuance of </p><p>any specific ROE.  Their orders directed the NAF to deploy to </p><p>Cote d\'Ivoire with a mission to provide close air support to </p><p>the GOCI forces in their operations against the rebels. </p><p>These sources indicated NAF assets in Cote d\'Ivoire were </p><p>directed to take their orders from the GOCI and that the GOCI </p><p>was responsible for coordinating operations with any other </p><p>country. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) NOTE: DATT believes it is possible that verbal </p><p>instructions may have been given to the NAF commander to </p><p>check with the GON before taking any action, and that the </p><p>various military headquarters were left out of the loop.  END </p><p>NOTE. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
