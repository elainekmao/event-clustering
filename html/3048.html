On May 29 Bornwell Chakaodza, editor of the </p><p>    independent weekly "Standard," was arrested for the </p><p>    fifth time in less than two weeks.  The May 29 arrest </p><p>    was, like the May 28 arrest, sparked by a story in the </p><p>    Standard detailing conditions Chakaodza and two of his </p><p>    colleagues encountered in the Harare jail when they </p><p>    were held overnight on May 16.  The May 29 arrest, </p><p>    however, was for violating a ban on "revealing </p><p>    internal police matters." </p><p>2.   Chakaodza\'s previous arrests were on May 16, 22, </p><p>    23 and 28.  He has not been mistreated by police and, </p><p>    after the initial arrest on May 16, has not been held </p><p>    overnight. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
