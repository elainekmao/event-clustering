<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001543 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ETRD, EAID, BEXP, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR\'S CALL ON MINISTER OF </p><p>COMMERCE: WORK REMAINS ON AGOA AND PROCTER & GAMBLE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> --------------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Ambassador Jeter met June 26 with Minister of </p><p>Commerce Bello for a discussion of U.S.-Nigeria trade </p><p>relations.  He stressed the need for Nigeria to take </p><p>advantage of AGOA\'s benefits quickly.  Minister Bello </p><p>concurred and thanked the U.S. for its capacity-building and </p><p>technical assistance efforts on AGOA.  He noted that the GON </p><p>will promote the sale of inputs, mainly textiles to countries </p><p>already AGOA-certified while developing Nigeria\'s own </p><p>finished-product export capacity.  Minister Bello was unclear </p><p>on AGOA statutory requirements regarding plant inspections </p><p>and records keeping.  Econ Chief noted those points and will </p><p>work closely with Ministry staff to ensure they are properly </p><p>reflected in the final Custom Code revisions presented to </p><p>USTR for certification.  Ambassador Jeter also raised Procter </p><p>& Gamble\'s interest in a differentiated tariff structure </p><p>designed to provide tariff relief for P&G while </p><p>simultaneously protecting Nigeria\'s domestic detergent </p><p>producers.  Although the proposal was not accepted </p><p>immediately, we will continue to push this idea at all levels </p><p>of the Ministry.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Ambassador Jeter, USAID Abuja Chief Economist Aulakh </p><p>and Embassy Economic Section Chief Carrig met June 25 with </p><p>Minister of Commerce Mustafa Bello, Permanent Secretary Amuna </p><p>Lawal Ali and six of the Ministry\'s Directors at the </p><p>Minister\'s Federal Secretariat office for a discussion of </p><p>U.S.-Nigerian trade relations.  Members of the press covered </p><p>the Ambassador\'s initial courtesy call. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) Ambassador Jeter opened by noting the importance of </p><p>commerce to our developing bilateral relationship, citing the </p><p>critical necessity to move "from aid to trade" as the basis </p><p>for our cooperative efforts.  He congratulated Bello on the </p><p>Commerce Ministry\'s progress in preparing Nigeria for full </p><p>participation in the export opportunities offered by the </p><p>Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>AGOA Preparations </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Noting that the "Asian Tigers" owe much of their </p><p>current prosperity to the preferential tariff structure </p><p>programs now available to Nigeria, Ambassador Jeter stressed </p><p>the importance of bringing Nigeria "on line" as quickly as </p><p>possible, given the time limit on Generalized System of </p><p>Preferences status for eligible AGOA countries. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) He continued that the current terms of trade are </p><p>overwhelmingly in Nigeria\'s favor and that the USG wants to </p><p>address that imbalance in a positive manner designed to </p><p>provide increased wealth and an improved standard of living </p><p>for all Nigerians.  That, the Ambassador noted, is the only </p><p>sure route to a meaningful "democracy dividend."  Ambassador </p><p>Jeter\'s remark that "We, the United States, want for </p><p>Nigerians what Nigerians want for themselves: prosperity and </p><p>a rightful place in global trade," drew spontaneous applause </p><p>from the Minister, his staff, and the press as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Minister Bello thanked Ambassador Jeter for his </p><p>observations on the signal importance of our trade relations </p><p>and praised the efforts of USAID and Embassy staff to </p><p>increase Nigeria\'s capacity to trade in world markets.  With </p><p>respect to AGOA, Bello outlined the GON\'s preparatory steps </p><p>that have included a November 2000 day-long joint </p><p>Embassy/Ministry of Commerce "AGOA Sensitization Seminar" for </p><p>the 36 State Commissioners of Commerce meeting at Jos, </p><p>Plateau State; combined GON/Embassy AGOA road shows; and the </p><p>GON\'s creation of AGOA committees at the State, Ministerial </p><p>and Presidential levels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Bello was particularly supportive of the </p><p>participation of USAID and Embassy officers as non-voting </p><p>members of key Presidential level committees, assisting in </p><p>developing products lines for export to the United States. </p><p>Ambassador Jeter reiterated the importance of moving quickly </p><p>to take advantage of Nigeria,s duty-free status for </p><p>thousands of products and commended Minister Bello,s </p><p>strategy to provide inputs to nations already AGOA compliant </p><p>on textiles (e.g. Mauritius, South Africa, and Lesotho) while </p><p>simultaneously ramping up Nigeria,s own export </p><p>infrastructure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) Bello also praised the Embassy\'s efforts to assist </p><p>GON officials in bringing Nigeria\'s Customs regulations and </p><p>criminal penalties for textile visa circumvention into line </p><p>with AGOA requirements.  He said he appreciated the Embassy\'s </p><p>offer of support for a Ministry-organized AGOA Sensitization </p><p>Seminar for key members of the National Assembly to acquaint </p><p>them with the changes needed in Nigeria\'s criminal code. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (U) Ambassador Jeter commented that the Embassy was ready </p><p>to assist the Ministry in the U.S. as well.  He noted that </p><p>Mr. Carrig, the Embassy,s AGOA coordinator, would be in </p><p>Washington during the month of July and was prepared to (a) </p><p>discuss the GON,s textile visa proposals with USTR and (b) </p><p>initiate coordination with prospective investors and buyers </p><p>of priority products lines identified by the Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Bello made a miss step, however, when he described </p><p>two key provisions of the AGOA statute ensuring Nigeria is in </p><p>compliance with the textile visa requirements as optional. </p><p>Speaking of the need to keep the Customs Code clutter-free so </p><p>as not to complicate trade relations with other countries (he </p><p>mentioned Japan), Bello suggested that Nigeria could ignore </p><p>-- in rewriting its regulations -- the AGOA requirement that </p><p>textile plants are subject to inspection by U.S. Customs.  He </p><p>also opined that Nigerian firms need not keep all the </p><p>"voluminous records" mandated by AGOA. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>Assistance to Procter & Gamble </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. (U) Ambassador Jeter reviewed for Minister Bello our </p><p>continuing efforts in support of Procter & Gamble\'s request </p><p>for tariff reductions on its Ariel soap powder in exchange </p><p>for a substantial increase in P&G\'s already sizeable </p><p>investment in Nigeria.  Nigerian producers fear competition </p><p>from cheap imports should the tariff barrier be lowered </p><p>across the board. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Ambassador and Econ Chief outlined the latest P&G </p><p>proposal, which calls for a differentiated tariff structure </p><p>based on the quality of the detergent product, in this case </p><p>its enzyme load.  In its elementary form, the P&G proposal </p><p>would have duties inversely proportional to quality - the </p><p>higher the quality, the lower the tariff.  This approach </p><p>could give P&G a break on tariffs for its high quality </p><p>product without necessarily endangering the lower end of the </p><p>market that domestic detergent producers fear they would lose </p><p>were the tariff barrier removed for all qualities of </p><p>detergent. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Minister Bello was not immediately supportive of the </p><p>idea.  He noted that P&G could relocate its Ariel production </p><p>facilities to Nigeria and benefit from Nigeria\'s export </p><p>promotion regime, perhaps saving the firm more money than a </p><p>cut in tariffs could provide.  The Minister\'s staffers in </p><p>early conversations with EconChief had also suggested that </p><p>P&G would be unlikely to get the tariff concessions it seeks </p><p>without: (a) agreeing to a price undertaking that would limit </p><p>competition with domestic products; and (b) a sunset </p><p>provision providing a date-certain by which the special </p><p>differentiated tariff structure would expire. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14. (SBU) Minister Bello, however, did not assert that any of </p><p>these suggestions were absolute or non-negotiable.  He </p><p>offered to convene a roundtable of the appropriate </p><p>decision-makers to listen directly to proposals by P&G </p><p>representatives and to have that group then make appropriate </p><p>recommendations to the Presidency.  (Comment.  Three times we </p><p>have scheduled just such a roundtable discussion.  Each time </p><p>one or another of the proposed participants, i.e., Commerce, </p><p>Finance, Office of the Vice President, Office of the Chief </p><p>Economic Advisor, Nigerian Export Promotion Council, and </p><p>Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission, has had to withdraw </p><p>at the last minute, scuttling the session.  We will continue </p><p>our efforts, however.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) Comment.  Minister Bello,s remarks about </p><p>Nigeria,s presumed capacity to negotiate the terms of AGOA </p><p>regarding record-keeping and U.S Customs access to Nigerian </p><p>textile factories surprised us.  We have been in close </p><p>contact with the Minister and his staff for months regarding </p><p>the provisions of AGOA.  Perhaps, his comment may have been </p><p>more directed to the press present in the room than to us. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Comment Continued: In a pull aside following the </p><p>meeting, EconChief mentioned to Bello that the provisions for </p><p>AGOA textile certification are not opening bids for bilateral </p><p>negotiations; rather, they are integral components of the </p><p>AGOA legislation, non-negotiable and applied equally to all </p><p>nations asking for AGOA benefits.  In subsequent </p><p>conversations with Bello,s staff, EconChief was assured that </p><p>the GON,s textile visa submission would be virtually </p><p>identical to that of South Africa,s already approved Customs </p><p>Code.  End Comment. </p><p>Jeter </p><p></p></div>
