<p>UNCLAS ABU DHABI 003209 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP, G/IWI AND DRL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KWMN, PHUM, PGOV, SCUL, PREL, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: NUMBER OF UAE WOMEN DIPLOMATS ON THE RISE </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT: The UAE female diplomatic </p><p>corps increased to 16 yesterday with the swearing in </p><p>of 8 more women diplomats.  An initiative of MFA </p><p>MinState Shaykh Hamdan, the MFA began accrediting </p><p>women as diplomats, with the ability to serve in </p><p>embassies overseas, in 2001.  The Ambassador has </p><p>encouraged Hamdan to increase the number of women </p><p>diplomats on a number of occasions, and we hope to see </p><p>an even greater number sworn in next year.  We will </p><p>support and encourage the development of women </p><p>diplomats through training opportunities in the U.S. </p><p>and participation in International Visitor programs </p><p>when possible.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  On 8 July, MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al </p><p>Nahyan swore in this year\'s crop of new diplomats. </p><p>Significantly, the class of 23 new diplomats contains </p><p>eight women, including Sheikha Nejla Al-Qassimi, </p><p>member of the Ras Al-Khaimah ruling family, MFA </p><p>Americas Desk Officer and one of our primary working- </p><p>level MFA contacts. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Al-Qassimi told Poloff on July 9 that the number </p><p>of female UAE diplomats now stands at 16.  In 2001, </p><p>the first two women diplomats were sworn in, and in </p><p>2002, six more took the oath.  She noted that prior to </p><p>2001, women worked in the MFA as staff members but </p><p>were not allowed to be diplomats because they were </p><p>women.  For example, two of the women sworn in last </p><p>year -- and attending UNGA this fall -- had been </p><p>working in the MFA Administrative Affairs Department </p><p>as staff, although they functioned as diplomats, for </p><p>six or seven years.  Al-Qassimi commented that the </p><p>initiative to accredit women as diplomats is being </p><p>pushed by Hamdan and is supported strongly by his </p><p>mother, UAE First Lady Shaykha Fatima Bint Mubarak. </p><p> </p><p>4.  In August, an 11-member working-level MFA </p><p>delegation, four of them women, will attend the UN </p><p>General Assembly.  Al-Qassimi stated that the MFA </p><p>endeavors to send junior diplomats to UNGA to gain </p><p>experience -- both in the U.S. and in diplomacy.  This </p><p>will be the first visit to the U.S. for many of the </p><p>junior diplomats attending UNGA this year.  Upon </p><p>arrival in New York, the working-level delegation will </p><p>attend a two-week course on the UN, then assist the </p><p>UAE Permanent Representative by sitting in on </p><p>committee meetings, taking notes, and giving daily </p><p>briefings. </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
