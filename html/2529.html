REASON:  1.5(B,D). </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a Feb. 26 meeting with the Ambassador, Inspector </p><p>General of Police Pradip SJB Rana blamed previous Nepali </p><p>Congress Party governments for creating circumstances that </p><p>led to the current Maoist insurgency.  Rana said he welcomed </p><p>the deployment of the Royal Nepal Army in fighting the </p><p>insurgency, but blamed the Home Ministry for not sufficiently </p><p>supporting the police.  He requested USG assistance, </p><p>including funding for training and equipment for a new </p><p>hospital, to help the police meet the increased challenges </p><p>they face.  He promised to increase security around the </p><p>Coca-Cola facilities in Kathmandu and Narayangadh.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>RANA THANKS AMBASSADOR FOR SUPPORT; </p><p>NOTES LACK OF SAME FROM GON </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  In a Feb. 26 meeting with the Ambassador, Inspector </p><p>General of Police Pradip SJB Rana expressed gratitude for the </p><p>Ambassador\'s speech the previous day, which received </p><p>front-page coverage in the local press (septel), condemning </p><p>Maoist attacks against security forces in Achham and Salyan </p><p>Districts (Refs A and B).  Rana told the Ambassador his </p><p>remarks had given a "real morale boost" to the dispirited </p><p>police, who lost 111 of their colleagues in the attacks.  The </p><p>Ambassador extended his condolences for the men lost to the </p><p>IGP, but noted that the police in both districts had fought </p><p>bravely against overwhelming numbers of attackers from the </p><p>other side.  In the past, Rana said, Maoists would typically </p><p>overrun isolated police posts, either killing or forcing the </p><p>surrender of all policemen at the site.  Over the past few </p><p>months, however, the police have had some victories, either </p><p>holding out (as in Salyan District) against the assault, or </p><p>repelling the attackers (as in Panchthar District - Ref C). </p><p>He added that while police had sustained heavy casualties </p><p>during the Achham attack, police fighting in the District </p><p>police headquarters were able to hold out against their </p><p>attackers until morning. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Rana said it had been agreed that the Royal Nepal </p><p>Army (RNA) will be given responsibility for coordinating all </p><p>actions taken by all three branches of Nepal\'s security </p><p>forces--the RNA, the Armed Police Force, and the civilian </p><p>police.  Rana described cooperation received by the RNA so </p><p>far as very good, contrasting it unfavorably with the </p><p>perceived lack of support from his own Home Ministry.  He </p><p>said he welcomed the involvement of the RNA in fighting the </p><p>insurgency since the Nov. 26 declaration of the state of </p><p>emergency.  Before the emergency, the Government of Nepal </p><p>(GON) viewed the insurgency as strictly a police problem. </p><p>"We were fighting alone for six years," he said, noting that </p><p>655 policemen have died since the onset of the insurgency. </p><p>Now, however, with the RNA and APF sharing responsibility for </p><p>addressing the insurgency, it is now recognized as what it </p><p>always was--a national problem. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  In fact, Rana charged, the roots of the Maoists\' </p><p>uprising are political, arising from "the misbehavior of the </p><p>government against them."  Some of the present-day Maoists, </p><p>like Baburam Bhattarai, had tried participating in mainstream </p><p>politics (Note:  as part of the United People\'s Front) in the </p><p>early 1990s, but Nepali Congress harassment of UPF activists </p><p>after they won nine seats in the 1991 elections drove them </p><p>underground. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Rana expressed frustration with the attitude </p><p>displayed by civilian government employees during the Feb. </p><p>22-23 nationwide strike declared by the Maoists (Ref B). </p><p>High-ranking GON officials had criticized him for his failure </p><p>to stop observance of the strike (or "bandh"), even though </p><p>they themselves complied with the Maoist-imposed bans </p><p>vehicular travel those days.  How are the police to </p><p>discourage general observation of the strike when prominent </p><p>Secretaries and Joint Secretaries of GON ministries </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>themselves were seen walking, rather than driving, to work on </p><p>bandh days, he wondered.  Although the police cannot force </p><p>people to drive or to open their shops, senior GON employees </p><p>could play a role by setting an example for the rest of the </p><p>population, he suggested.  He agreed that an overall sense of </p><p>fear in the wake of the violent attacks in Achham and Salyan </p><p>had likely been critical in influencing the general </p><p>public--including GON officials--to observe the strike. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>AID NEEDED </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  The GON has set up a provident fund for survivors </p><p>of slain policemen that includes schooling for two children </p><p>and a payment of USD 9,000 for the widow.  (Note:  The </p><p>typical policeman\'s salary is approximately USD 54 dollars a </p><p>month.)  Individual policemen also contribute out of their </p><p>own pocket to a benevolent fund for families of policemen </p><p>killed or injured in the line of duty.  Rana said he had </p><p>already built a police hospital in Nepalgunj with the funds. </p><p>Since his  resources covered only construction costs, </p><p>however, the building is virtually empty, with little to no </p><p>equipment or furniture.  He asked if the USG might be able to </p><p>provide funding for this effort.  The Ambassador said he </p><p>would look into the matter.  Rana also asked for continued </p><p>USG support for police training, adding that no Nepali </p><p>candidates have been given a seat at the FBI Academy over the </p><p>past five years. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>MORE SECURITY FOR COCA-COLA </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  Rana reported little progress in tracking down the </p><p>perpetrators of two minor bombing incidents at Coca-Cola </p><p>facilities in Kathmandu and Narayangadh (Ref D and previous). </p><p> He said he had recommended to the Managing Director that he </p><p>hire ex-police or former RNA soldiers as security guards, </p><p>rather than the inexperienced young men now employed.  The </p><p>GON is also considering plans to provide an "industrial </p><p>security police force" to businesses threatened by the </p><p>insurgency.  At the Ambassador\'s request, he agreed to </p><p>increase police security around the two facilities. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  Rana seemed to take great pains to discount rumors </p><p>of tensions--many of them due to competition for scarce </p><p>budgetary resources--between the RNA and the civilian police, </p><p>emphasizing instead his disenchantment with the GON.  His </p><p>comments decrying the lack of civilian leadership, especially </p><p>during the recent bandh, make him sound increasingly like his </p><p>RNA counterpart, Chief of Army Staff Prajwalla SJB Rana. </p><p>Reports of human rights violations by police have declined </p><p>significantly since the IGP\'s sixteen-month tenure--a </p><p>tangible indication that he is trying hard to improve the </p><p>quality of an under-equipped, inadequately trained police </p><p>force that has lost much of the public\'s esteem over the six </p><p>years of the Maoist insurgency.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
