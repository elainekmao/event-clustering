<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 001431 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS, SA/RA AND S/CT </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/GURNEY </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, CASC, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL:  MAOISTS ANNOUNCE THEIR RETURN TO TALKS, </p><p>BUT THREATS TO AMERICAN INTERESTS INCREASE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. KATHMANDU 1418 </p><p>     B. KATHMANDU 1423 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b) and </p><p> (d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In the afternoon of July 31, the Maoists announced </p><p>that they would sit for a third round of peace talks on the </p><p>condition that the third round would address political, </p><p>rather than technical matters.  The Nepalese police have </p><p>received reports from villagers that British and American </p><p>trekkers in two northern districts could be kidnapped or </p><p>killed.  Save the Children U.S., was ordered to shut down its </p><p>development projects in three districts immediately north of </p><p>Kathmandu under threat of "severe action."  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>Maoists to Sit for Third Round of Talks </p><p>========================================= </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) At 1630 on July 31, the Embassy received from </p><p>Government of Nepal sources a copy of a public statement </p><p>accredited to Maoist supremo Prachanda, stating that the </p><p>Maoists have decided to sit for the third round of peace </p><p>talks.  The statement continued by demanding that the next </p><p>round should focus on political matters, rather than </p><p>technical or procedural issues.  Although unsigned, the </p><p>statement matches previous public announcements in form and </p><p>content.  The head of the government-run media quoted the </p><p>government\'s lead negotiator, Minister Kamal Thapa, as saying </p><p>the talks would be held.  The Embassy has learned also that </p><p>due to claimed security concerns, the Maoists will likely </p><p>return Maoist ideologue and chief negotiator Baburam </p><p>Bhattarai and an additional, unnamed negotiator to Kathmandu </p><p>from their current sanctuaries in India. </p><p> </p><p>Threats to American and British Trekkers </p><p>========================================= </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The ARSO received a report today from the Nepalese </p><p>police that trekkers in Manang and Mustang (north-central </p><p>Nepal) are being stopped and shaken down for money.  Once the </p><p>Maoists established that the trekkers were not from the U.S. </p><p>or Britain, they were allowed to pass.  Local villagers </p><p>quoted the Maoists with saying that it was a good thing that </p><p>the trekkers were not from America or Britain because </p><p>otherwise they would be kidnapped or killed. </p><p> </p><p>Threats to Save the Children U.S. </p><p>================================== </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) On July 29, the Maoists posted notices in the </p><p>districts of Nuwakot, Rasuwa, and Sindhupalchok (the three </p><p>districts immediately north of Kathmandu).  The Embassy spoke </p><p>with the Country Director of Save the Children U.S., who </p><p>reported that they are evaluating the safety of their four </p><p>Nepali staff members in Nuwakot and may consider withdrawing </p><p>them.  The Director reported that his staff in the field has </p><p>not yet been approached directly by the Maoists. </p><p> </p><p>Begin text of the Maoist notice: </p><p> </p><p>Notice of Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) of Nuwakot, Rasuwa </p><p>and Sindhupalchok </p><p> </p><p>1.  The justice loving public is heartily requested to help </p><p>fully close the NGO and INGO run by the American </p><p>imperialists, and not to support or work in such </p><p>organizations. </p><p> </p><p>2.  It is found that Save the Children run by the American </p><p>Imperialists is carrying out its activities under the cover </p><p>of the Red Cross.  A pious institution like Red Cross is </p><p>requested not to run the programs of Save the Children under </p><p>its cover. </p><p> </p><p>3.  All the temporary teachers should be made permanent </p><p>without condition, and request the school management and the </p><p>principal not to appoint or let the so-called permanent </p><p>teachers attend school, except those who are presently </p><p>working. </p><p> </p><p>4.  All justice loving members of the public are heartily </p><p>requested to implement the above notice. </p><p> </p><p>The Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) will be compelled to take </p><p>severe action if any activities are carried out ignoring this </p><p>notice. </p><p> </p><p>With revolutionary greetings </p><p>Thanks! </p><p> </p><p>End text. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Peace Talks:  The Maoists\' decision to return to the </p><p>negotiating table is a welcome relief for the government </p><p>(refs A & B).  However, the government\'s concessions to save </p><p>peace talks have rewarded the Maoists\' brinkmanship, </p><p>increasing the likelihood that the Maoists will try this </p><p>tactic again. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Threats to Americans:  The threats made against Save </p><p>the Children echo earlier reports on Maoist efforts to limit </p><p>U.S.-funded development programs.  The head of Nepal\'s </p><p>National Planning Commission, Shanker Sharma, told the </p><p>Ambassador today that Maoists in a number of districts are </p><p>increasing pressure on foreign supported NGOs in general, but </p><p>are being more tolerant of Nepali NGOs.  The threats to </p><p>American and British travelers is a new and troubling </p><p>development.  In the past, Maoists have issued public </p><p>statements welcoming tourists to Nepal and assuring them that </p><p>their struggle was with the Government of Nepal only.  Post </p><p>will follow up on this report to determine whether it is </p><p>repeated. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
