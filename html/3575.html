<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004829 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARN, NEA/PA, NEA/AIA, INR/NESA, R/MR, </p><p>I/GNEA, B/BXN, B/BRN, NEA/PPD, NEA/IPA FOR ALTERMAN </p><p>USAID/ANE/MEA </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH </p><p>PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p>USCINCCENT//CCPA, USCENTCOM REAR MACDILL AFB FL </p><p>STATE PASS TO AID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS: KMDR JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON MIDDLE EAST ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>                        Summary </p><p> </p><p>-- All Jordanian dailies on August 25 highlighted the </p><p>upcoming visit by Deputy Assistant Secretary </p><p>Satterfield to the region to "sell" the idea of </p><p>"diminishing" Arafat\'s authority by appointing a </p><p>Palestinian Prime Minister.  Wire service reports </p><p>quote an unidentified high-level Israeli official as </p><p>saying that the United States is sending DAS </p><p>Satterfield to "urge the Palestinians to appoint a </p><p>Prime Minister."  The same reports quote chief </p><p>Palestinian negotiator Sa\'eb Ureikat to the London- </p><p>based Al-Hayat newspaper as saying that the </p><p>Palestinians had earlier rejected a U.S. proposal to </p><p>appoint a Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p>Another major story today highlights reports about an </p><p>Iraqi diplomatic campaign to be launched soon to </p><p>explain to the Arab world the "dangers of American </p><p>threats against Iraq". </p><p> </p><p>One columnist criticized a U.S. "plan" to provide </p><p>genetically-modified foods as part of its assistance </p><p>to developing countries, arguing that this is a </p><p>"vicious" plan to destroy agriculture in developing </p><p>countries. </p><p> </p><p>                 Editorial Commentary </p><p> </p><p>-- "Israel reneges on its pledges" </p><p> </p><p>Center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(08/25) editorializes:  "It was no surprise to hear </p><p>Israel\'s announcement about breaking its pledge of </p><p>withdrawal from the Gaza area.  This brings to mind </p><p>the long series of Israeli non-compliance from </p><p>international accords signed with the Palestinian </p><p>Authority.  It also confirms that no pledge or </p><p>understanding or agreement signed or reached with the </p><p>Hebrew state is to be trusted.  We view this Israeli </p><p>step as further proof that the Sharon government does </p><p>not have a political alternative to this crisis, and </p><p>that the military escalation is the only approach this </p><p>extremist, right-wing government has opted for." </p><p> </p><p>-- "American contradictions" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Mazen Saket writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(08/25):  "The United States, the richest, most </p><p>advanced and powerful country in the world, is the </p><p>sole representative and leader of the new world order, </p><p>is currently assuming the mantle of a colonialist </p><p>regime these days.  The question that needs to be </p><p>asked is why have international relations taken a back </p><p>seat to colonialism?  The only answer I can find - </p><p>other than interests and the imbalance of power -- is </p><p>related to culture and civilization.  U.S. society is </p><p>unable to respond to the culture and civilizations of </p><p>(other) peoples and nations; it rather wants to </p><p>nullify them and replace them." </p><p> </p><p>-- "New American blackmail: famine or genetically- </p><p>modified food products" </p><p> </p><p>Daily columnist Bater Wardam writes on the op-ed page </p><p>of center-left, influential Arabic daily Al-Dustour </p><p>(08/25):  "Six African countries out of seven, </p><p>currently suffering from famine, have agreed to </p><p>receive American food assistance in the form of </p><p>genetically-modified products, manufactured by U.S. </p><p>companies.  The Americans are taking advantage of </p><p>Africa\'s famine in order to force these countries to </p><p>receive only  genetically-modified food products.  It </p><p>is part of a scheme to eliminate the agriculture </p><p>sector not only in Africa but in all the world.  It is </p><p>another vicious American policy that seeks to benefit </p><p>its own companies, causing the destruction of </p><p>agricultural capabilities in developing countries." </p><p>BERRY </p><p></p></div>
