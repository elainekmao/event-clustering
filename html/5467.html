Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C/NF) SUMMARY:  The Ambassador met with Minister </p><p>Milinda Moragoda on February 1.  Moragoda set low </p><p>expectations for the February 7-8 GSL-LTTE talks in </p><p>Berlin and expressed concerns about Tamil Tiger </p><p>activities.  He also elaborated on his efforts to </p><p>convince India to engage more re the peace process.  On </p><p>the domestic front, he did not think parliamentary </p><p>elections were in the immediate offing, but thought it </p><p>possible that the president might try for elections in </p><p>selected localities to test the GSL.  While he was not </p><p>hitting the panic button, our sense was that Moragoda </p><p>felt the government had its hands full.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>=========================== </p><p>Low Expectations for Berlin </p><p>=========================== </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C/NF) The Ambassador and DCM met February 1 with </p><p>Milinda Moragoda, the GSL Minister of Economic Reform </p><p>and a key player on peace process issues.  Moragoda set </p><p>low expectations for the GSL talks with the Liberation </p><p>Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) slated to take place in </p><p>Berlin, February 7-8.  (Note:  The Berlin talks will </p><p>constitute the fifth round of talks held between the two </p><p>sides since September 2002.)  He said he did not expect </p><p>any breakthroughs in Berlin.  That was unfortunate </p><p>because the peace process could use the additional </p><p>momentum, he remarked.  (Note:  According to most </p><p>reports, the Berlin talks are slated to focus mainly on </p><p>human rights and humanitarian issues.) </p><p> </p><p>================================ </p><p>Deepening Worries about the LTTE </p><p>================================ </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C/NF) Moragoda expressed deep concern about LTTE </p><p>activities, seeing the group as becoming increasingly </p><p>aggressive.  In particular, the situation in the multi- </p><p>ethnic east was a real problem, as the LTTE worked to </p><p>expand its influence there.  The pattern of Tiger </p><p>activities, in turn, was leading to more extremism among </p><p>Muslims, forcing the government to watch the potentially </p><p>combustible situation in the east very closely.  He </p><p>added that LTTE eastern leader Karuna was proving not to </p><p>be very cooperative with the GSL.  He wondered whether </p><p>the LTTE high command in the north had any real control </p><p>over its eastern command, given that the LTTE leadership </p><p>had repeatedly said it wanted its cadre to work with the </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C/NF) As an example of problems with the LTTE in </p><p>the east, Moragoda reviewed an incident that received a </p><p>lot of local press coverage last week.  During a late </p><p>January visit to Batticaloa, Moragoda related that he </p><p>had come across a large billboard (a "hoarding" as </p><p>Moragoda called it) at the entrance to the city.  The </p><p>sign carried a blatantly pro-LTTE message.  Noting that </p><p>the sign was on government property, Moragoda told the </p><p>police to tear it down, which they did, but the next day </p><p>pro-LTTE Tamils put it back up.  Acting at Moragoda\'s </p><p>instructions, the police then tore it down again and </p><p>destroyed it.  Moragoda noted that the police had acted </p><p>reluctantly in dealing with the matter. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C/NF) Trying to explain the dynamics of the </p><p>situation in the east, Moragoda commented that several </p><p>factors seemed to be underlying the pattern of LTTE </p><p>misbehavior.  First, the Tigers were a "wild bunch" in </p><p>general and it would take a long time to "domesticate" </p><p>them.  Second, the LTTE was clearly taking advantage of </p><p>lax law enforcement by the police and military. </p><p>Moragoda said he had spoken with security force </p><p>officials in the east about this, advising them to </p><p>enforce all laws (see Batticaloa sign incident above). </p><p>The officials responded that they were worried about </p><p>doing this due to the potential ramifications for the </p><p>peace process should they come down hard on the LTTE. </p><p>Moragoda said he told them just to do their jobs. </p><p>Third, Moragoda said the Tigers were clearly "hedging </p><p>their bets" out of a deep concern that anti-peace </p><p>process elements could gain the upper hand in the south </p><p>(see Paras 10-11).  All that said, Moragoda stressed </p><p>that the government had to let the LTTE know there were </p><p>"boundaries" that it could not cross. </p><p>6.  (C/NF) In other comments re the Tigers, Moragoda </p><p>related that the group did not seem to have any </p><p>intention of moving to stop its use of child soldiers </p><p>(see Reftels).  In fact, Moragoda remarked, the LTTE\'s </p><p>positioning on the issue seemed to be getting worse.  In </p><p>the past, the group denied that it was recruiting </p><p>children, but now it was basically admitting that it </p><p>did, but saying "so what."  Explaining this phenomenon, </p><p>Moragoda said he thought that many of the Tigers had </p><p>been brought into the group basically as children and </p><p>saw no problem with that fact.  (Note: UNICEF Executive </p><p>Director Carol Bellamy met with the LTTE last week and </p><p>pressed the group on the forced child recruitment issue. </p><p>As they have in the past, the Tigers essentially </p><p>promised to do better, without making any firm </p><p>guarantees.) </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C/NF) Returning to a theme he has touched on </p><p>previously (see Reftels), Moragoda said he was deeply </p><p>concerned for the future of the peace process if chief </p><p>LTTE negotiator Anton Balasingham left the scene.  He </p><p>said Balasingham was very ill, much more so than many </p><p>people thought (see Reftels), and it was questionable </p><p>whether he could remain involved in the talks.  (Note: </p><p>The February talks were recently shifted to Berlin from </p><p>Bangkok at the LTTE\'s request, so they could be held </p><p>closer to Balasingham\'s London home.)  If anything </p><p>happened to Balasingham, Moragoda said he was not sure </p><p>whom in the LTTE had the ability to replace him as chief </p><p>LTTE negotiator.  S.P. Thamilchelvam, the political </p><p>assistant to LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran, did not, nor </p><p>did Karuna, the LTTE leader in the east. </p><p> </p><p>======== </p><p>Re India </p><p>======== </p><p> </p><p>8.  (S/NF) Shifting focus, Moragoda related that he </p><p>continued to try to get India more involved in Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s peace process.  (Note:  Moragoda wanted his </p><p>comments on this matter to be kept strictly </p><p>confidential.)  Re the GoI situation, Moragoda said he </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>was convinced that there was a split between the </p><p>National Security Adviser\'s office and RAW on one hand, </p><p>and the Ministry of External Affairs on the other, with </p><p>the former wanting to assume a more activist posture on </p><p>Sri Lanka than the latter. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (S/NF) Moragoda said he was urging RAW to get more </p><p>involved and he had heard that the agency was thinking </p><p>of trying to make contact with the LTTE.  In fact, RAW </p><p>might try to contact Balasingham during the LTTE </p><p>negotiator\'s planned visit to LTTE-controlled northern </p><p>Sri Lanka later this month.  Moragoda noted that he </p><p>planned to visit India later in February with Prime </p><p>Minister Wickremesinghe.  On that trip, he (Moragoda) </p><p>planned to meet with Sonia Gandhi, the Congress Party </p><p>leader, at the request of National Security Adviser </p><p>Mishra.  The idea was to brief her on the peace process </p><p>and try to moderate her strongly anti-LTTE views. </p><p>(Note:  Mrs. Gandhi\'s husband, former Prime Minister </p><p>Rajiv Gandhi, was assassinated by the LTTE in 1991.) </p><p> </p><p>================== </p><p>Domestic Situation </p><p>================== </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C/NF) In regard to the domestic political </p><p>situation, Moragoda said he did not expect President </p><p>Kumaratunga to dissolve Parliament and call new </p><p>elections soon.  (Note:  Per Reftels, Kumaratunga and </p><p>other politicians from her People\'s Alliance party have </p><p>recently raised the idea of early elections in various </p><p>public statements.)  Explaining why she might not do so, </p><p>Moragoda advised that in his estimation the president </p><p>and the PA did not want early elections because they </p><p>would probably lose seats, with the United National </p><p>Front (UNF) governing coalition at least holding its </p><p>own.  If elections were held, he also predicted that the </p><p>Tamil National Alliance and the radical Janantha </p><p>Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party would gain seats (the JVP </p><p>gaining at the expense of the PA).  He added that he </p><p>thought that early elections would decimate the Sri </p><p>Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), which was seriously </p><p>hobbled by fierce party infighting. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C/NF) Although early parliamentary elections were </p><p>probably not in the cards, Moragoda said Kumaratunga </p><p>might call provincial elections in order to "test" the </p><p>GSL\'s popularity.  (Note:  The PA controls most of Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s provincial councils, which are elected bodies.) </p><p>In particular, she might try to call an election for the </p><p>Southern Province, an area where the PA might be </p><p>expected to do well.  (Note:  The PA has traditionally </p><p>been quite strong in the mainly Sinhalese Buddhist south </p><p>of the country.)  Moragoda noted that he had picked up </p><p>some rumblings that Buddhist monks and others were not </p><p>happy with the peace process, feeling that the </p><p>government was giving too much to the LTTE.  If this was </p><p>the case, the GSL could be becoming politically exposed </p><p>in the south. </p><p> </p><p>======= </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C/NF) While he was not hitting the panic button, </p><p>our overall sense from the discussion with Moragoda was </p><p>that he was worried that the government was drifting a </p><p>bit and must work harder to keep the initiative.  In </p><p>particular, he felt that the Tigers were a big problem, </p><p>and the GSL had to find a way to engage the group firmly </p><p>and effectively, so that the peace process was not </p><p>disrupted.  At the same time, the GSL was under pressure </p><p>on the domestic front, with the president proving non- </p><p>cooperative on the peace process and in regard to </p><p>economic reform.  Although she might not call elections </p><p>soon, Moragoda said she was looking for every </p><p>opportunity to slam the government.  Given this tricky </p><p>confluence of factors, Moragoda was clearly sweating it </p><p>out a bit, but was seemingly hopeful that more Indian </p><p>involvement could bring pressure on the LTTE and help </p><p>the GSL\'s peace initiative.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
