(SBU) In a recent address to the Indian Business </p><p>and Professional Group, UAE Labor Undersecretary </p><p>Khalid Al-Khazraji said all the right things. First, </p><p>he confirmed that the UAE will continue to import </p><p>multiethnic labor, primarily from the Indian </p><p>subcontinent (something that no doubt went down well </p><p>with his hosts), but added that the UAE would seek to </p><p>diversify away from over reliance on any one labor </p><p>source. He went on to say that the government would </p><p>require higher educational qualifications for visa </p><p>recipients and generally make work permits more </p><p>difficult to obtain for unskilled workers. Second, Al- </p><p>Khazraji reiterated the government\'s commitment to </p><p>increasing employment for nationals in the private </p><p>sector -- sixty percent of whom are under the age of </p><p>23 and will be entering the labor market in the near </p><p>future.  Al-Khazraji estimated that 10,000 nationals </p><p>would graduate and enter the work force this year and </p><p>he expected that all would find jobs -- without the </p><p>sort of coercive nationalization programs for the </p><p>private sector prevalent in other GCC countries. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Yet, despite Al-Khazraji\'s focus on a policy </p><p>of importing "high value" skilled expatriate labor, </p><p>the reality is quite different.  Last year, the UAE </p><p>issued 330,000 work permits -- a six percent increase </p><p>from the previous year -- and most were for low-skill </p><p>construction and maintenance jobs (45% went to </p><p>Indians). Though the UAE has heavily publicized an </p><p>amnesty encouraging illegal laborers to leave the </p><p>country, and trumpets its future economy as being </p><p>cutting edge high-tech and modern, it continues to </p><p>remain heavily dependent upon low-wage, unskilled </p><p>workers. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) With regard to increasing the number of </p><p>Emiratis in the private sector, there is a clear and </p><p>abiding divergence between what nationals expect and </p><p>what their skills can reasonably command in an open </p><p>economy.  To its credit, the UAEG has opened a number </p><p>of colleges of higher technology to develop a more </p><p>sophisticated national workforce, focusing more on </p><p>developing useful skill sets in young Emiratis rather </p><p>than forcing private employers to hire nationals. </p><p>However, Emiratis who seek jobs in the private sector </p><p>expect starting salaries of 8,000-10,000 dirhams a </p><p>month (? $2100-$2700) upon graduation in a society </p><p>where they pay no taxes, and receive free health care, </p><p>car benefits, and housing subsidies (a comparable U.S. </p><p>wage would be $50,000-$60,000). Given their lack of </p><p>experience and higher salary demands, businesses </p><p>understandably prefer to hire better educated, more </p><p>seasoned expatriates willing to work harder for less </p><p>money and who can more easily be fired if thing don\'t </p><p>work out. No matter how good a job the UAE does in </p><p>training its people, it is distinctly unlikely that </p><p>their salary expectations will ever be reached in the </p><p>marketplace absent government intervention. </p><p> </p><p>Albright </p><p></p></div>
