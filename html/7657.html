<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 000791 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/24/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, AO, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ANGOLAN FOREIGN MINISTER\'S VISIT TO ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Joseph G. Sullivan for reasons 1.5(b/d) </p><p> </p><p> 1. (C) Summary: Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda </p><p>visited Zimbabwe March 22-24 and met with Government and MDC </p><p>leaders.  Miranda, who will chair the SADC Task Force on </p><p>Zimbabwe visit next month told us that the clear focus of his </p><p>visit was on Zimbabwe\'s crisis, although he met GOZ denial </p><p>and ambivalence about facing up to the problems. Miranda was </p><p>whisked on a magical mystery tour by the GOZ, but saw the </p><p>effective work stayaway for himself. We believe that Miranda </p><p>gathered a very good appreciation for the depth of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>problems and for the critical need to address Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>political crisis.  Miranda for the most part abstained from </p><p>public remarks during his visit. His visit will provide </p><p>useful input for President Dos Santos who will open the </p><p>Zimbabwe Trade Fair next week. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.(c) Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda visited Zimbabwe </p><p>for less than 48 hours and the GOZ sought to monopolize his </p><p>time, even taking him on a 6-hour trip to Manicaland to view </p><p>"successful" examples of the land redistribution exercise. </p><p>Accompanying Agriculture Minister Made claimed to Miranda </p><p>that corn production this year would be 1.4 million metric </p><p>tons (unlikely). Having had his previously scheduled meeting </p><p>time with MDC President Tsvangirai pre-empted, Miranda met </p><p>with Tsvangirai on the morning of April 24, as well as with </p><p>President Mugabe. </p><p> </p><p>3.(c)  The Ambassador met with Miranda on the evening of </p><p>April 23 at the Angolan Ambassador\'s residence.  Miranda </p><p>described his GOZ hosts as ambivalent over whether to </p><p>confront their own crisis or to pretend that the crisis would </p><p>go away and that their excuses for inability to compromise </p><p>were real.  Miranda met with President Mugabe, parliamentary </p><p>speaker Mnangagwa, Foreign Minister Mudenge, and Agriculture </p><p>Minister Made.  Miranda had noted how effective the ZCTU work </p><p>stayaway was and believed that Zimbabwe\'s crisis required a </p><p>political solution.  He had encouraged his hosts to drop the </p><p>treason case against Tsvangirai, and when they claimed </p><p>juridical impediments, suggested amnesty. Miranda told us </p><p>that he did not think that an election rerun was an answer, </p><p>but agreed that Mugabe was an impediment to a solution and </p><p>that it was inconceivable to imagine Mugabe serving out his </p><p>full term. Miranda was also disinclined to favor an interim </p><p>government because of African history of such governments </p><p>remaining indefinitely.  We encouraged Miranda to think of a </p><p>package, including Mugabe\'s resignation at an early date, </p><p>coupled with agreement with the opposition on a new election </p><p>date and a transitional government while election procedures </p><p>are corrected and the rule of law is restored.  Miranda was </p><p>inclined to press the MDC to drop its election suit, but </p><p>seemed to accept that it would be more practical to expect </p><p>such action in the context of a global agreement. </p><p> </p><p>4. (c) Miranda told us that he was letting his GOZ hosts know </p><p>that regional backing only extended so far and that the </p><p>region was becoming impatient with Zimbabwe\'s crisis and the </p><p>GOZ\'s unwillingness to face it.  He said that South African </p><p>and Angolan(Miala) intelligence services were now working </p><p>well together and that Zimbabwe\'s problems were the principal </p><p>topic among them.  Because we were not sure how much the </p><p>Angolans have been briefed, we did not raise the now </p><p>postponed visit of Presidents Muluzi and Mbeki. </p><p> </p><p>5. (c) Miranda was very conscious of his hosts\' tendency to </p><p>manipulate any comments by visitors into signs of support. </p><p>He consequently refrained from public comment for the most </p><p>part and called on all political parties and social forces to </p><p>work together to overcome Zimbabwe\'s problems. Asked about </p><p>the agrarian project he had seen, Miranda gave away the least </p><p>possible, calling it "a good start." As a sure sign of state </p><p>media frustration, ZBC reporters took to reporting what they </p><p>would have liked Miranda to say. </p><p> </p><p>6. (c)  Angolan President Dos Santos is scheduled to visit </p><p>Zimbabwe next week to open the Zimbabwe trade fair in </p><p>Bulawayo, although Dos Santos has a history of canceling </p><p>planned travel at the last minute. (The trade fair itself </p><p>will be even less impressive than a year ago.) </p><p> </p><p>7. (c) Comment: We are confident that Miranda gained a solid </p><p>appreciation for the depth of Angola\'s crisis and expect that </p><p>he will have an opportunity to brief President Dos Santos </p><p>prior to his visit next week.  Whether the </p><p>non-confrontational Dos Santos is willing to deliver any hard </p><p>messages remains to be seen and whether Mugabe would be </p><p>inclined to listen to such messages is also in doubt. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
