THE CODEL TOURED THE </p><p>MASSIVELY OVERCROWDED FACILITY, VIEWING SLEEPING ROOMS </p><p>WITH WALL-TO-WALL AND FLOOR-TO-CEILING BEDS, SEVERELY </p><p>TAXED SANITATION FACILITIES, HALLWAYS SO CRAMMED WITH </p><p>STILL-TRAUMATIZED MEN THAT MOVEMENT WAS NEXT TO </p><p>IMPOSSIBLE, AND UNDERSTAFFED ICRC AND UNHCR </p><p>CONTINGENTS ENGAGED IN A VALIANT, SUPERMHUMAN EFFORT </p><p>TO MEET THE EX-DETAINEES BASIC NEEDS.

SENATOR DECONCINI TOLD PRESIDENT TUDJMAN THAT THE </p><p>U.S. CONGRESS REMAINED VERY CONCERNED ABOUT EVENTS IN </p><p>THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.  HE NOTED HIS JUST-CONCLUDED </p><p>VISIT TO THE EX-DETAINEE TRANSIT CAMP AND THE UGLY </p><p>STORIES THAT HE HAD HEARD THERE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  TUDJMAN WELCOMED THE DELEGATION AND REITERATED </p><p>CROATIA\'S COMMITMENT TO DEVELOP A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. </p><p>HE NOTED THAT HE HAD WON A MANDATE IN HIS RE-ELECTION </p><p>AS PRESIDENT IN AUGUST.  HE RECALLED THAT THE ELECTION </p><p>CAMPAIGN HAD BEGUN WITH CONCERN THAT EXTREMISTS OF </p><p>THE RIGHT AND LEFT -- THE CROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHT AND </p><p>THE EX-COMMUNISTS CROATIAN PARTY OF RENEWAL -- WOULD </p><p>EACH GARNER SOME 15 PERCENT OF THE VOTE.  IN THE </p><p>EVENT, EACH EXTREME WON ONLY 3-5 PERCENT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>CROATIA\'S ECONOMIC PLIGHT </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  TUDJMAN SAID THAT CROATIA FACED SERIOUS ECONOMIC </p><p>PROBLEMS AS IT MADE THE TRANSITION FROM A SOCIALLY- </p><p>OWNED TO A FREE-MARKET ECONOMY.  INFLATION IS </p><p>CLIMBING, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE </p><p>FORMER YUGOSLAV MARKET AND THE BURDEN OF MILITARY </p><p>DEFENSE EXPENDITURES.  THE WAR DESTROYED A GREAT PART </p><p>OF CROATIA\'S PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. . </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02517  02 OF 06  271302Z </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02517  03 OF 06  271305Z </p><p>ACTION H-06 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   DS-00    EUR-01   IO-19    ADS-00   OIC-02   SS-00 </p><p>        /028W </p><p>                  ------------------7F56E8  271305Z /38 </p><p>P 271307Z NOV 92 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 2833 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION USVIENNA </p><p>USIA WASHDC 2475 </p><p> COMSIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GM//ECJ3/ECJ5// </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02517  03 OF 06  271305Z </p><p>CTF SIXZERO//N2// </p><p>CTF SIXONE//N2// </p><p>CTF SIXTWO//N2// </p><p>CTF SIXSEVEN//JOCC// </p><p>FOSIF ROTA SP </p><p>USEC BRUSSELS </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC 1097 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 06 ZAGREB 02517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR USDEL ICFY - JACKOVICH </p><p> </p><p>CROATIA SUPPORTED SOME 300,000 DISPLACED CROATS AND </p><p>450,000 REFUGEES FROM BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA (B-H).  THIS </p><p>WAS BEYOND CROATIA\'S ABILITY TO COPE.  INTERNATIONAL </p><p>HELP FOR THE REFUGEES HAD BEEN INSUFFICIENT.  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S AIM WAS TO CONTROL INFLATION SUFFICIENTLY </p><p>TO MOVE TO CURRENCY CONVERTIBILITY IN 1993. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>UNPROFOR AND THE UNPAS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>- </p><p>7.  TUDJMAN SAID UNPROFOR MUST COMPLETE ITS MISSION, </p><p>WHICH IS TO IMPLEMENT THE VANCE PLAN FULLY.  HE ASKED </p><p>RHETORICALLY WHY, IF UNPROFOR WERE UNABLE TO </p><p>IMPLEMENT THE VANCE PLAN BY MARCH 1993, IT SHOULD BE </p><p>EXTENDED.  HE SAID CROATIA WANTED TO SEE:  1) THE </p><p>RETURN OF THE DISPLACED PERSONS; 2) DISARMING OF THE </p><p>SERBIAN PARAMILITARIES; AND 3) REOPENING OF </p><p>TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION LINKS THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02517  03 OF 06  271305Z </p><p>COUNTRY.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THE SERBS IN THE UNITED </p><p>NATIONS PROTECTED AREAS (UNPAS) ARE ONLY A SMALL </p><p>PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SERBS IN CROATIA. </p><p>BUT PROGRESS IN THESE AREAS WAS CRITICALLY DEPENDENT </p><p>ON RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT IN BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>CROATIA\'S ACTIONS IN BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  TUDJMAN SAID CROATIA HAD A VITAL INTEREST IN </p><p>PEACE IN B-H, WITHOUT WHICH THERE COULD NEVER BE </p><p>PEACE ALONG CROATIA\'S BORDERS WITH B-H.  CROATIA </p><p>WANTS B-H TO REMAIN A SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT </p><p>NATION OF ITS THREE CONSTITUENT PEOPLES, TUDJMAN </p><p>STATED.  B-H\'S POLITICAL ORGANIZATION MUST BE BASED </p><p>ON THE RIGHTS OF ALL THREE PEOPLES.  IN B-H, THE TWO </p><p>KEY PROBLEMS ARE:  HOW TO STOP SERBIAN AGGRESSION AND </p><p>HOW TO GET THE MUSLIMS TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. </p><p> </p><p>9.  SENATOR DECONCINI NOTED THAT VARIOUS CRITICISMS </p><p>WERE OFTEN LEVELLED AGAINST CROATIA IN THE U.S.  HE </p><p>ASKED TUDJMAN HOW ONE OUGHT TO RESPOND TO CHARGES </p><p>THAT THE CROATS TOO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN ATROCITIES IN </p><p>DETENTION CAMPS THEY RAN IN B-H AND THAT CROATIA HAD </p><p>TERRITORIAL DESIGNS ON PARTS OF B-H.  THE SENATOR </p><p>ADDED THE QUESTION WHETHER, IF CROATIA WERE FIXED ON </p><p>A "THREE PEOPLES" APPROACH TO B-H, IT WOULD BE </p><p>POSSIBLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT A DIVISION OF </p><p>B-H TERRITORY. </p><p>- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ZAGREB  02517  03 OF 06  271305Z </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ZAGREB  02517  04 OF 06  271306Z </p><p>ACTION H-06 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   DS-00    EUR-01   IO-19    ADS-00   OIC-02   SS-00 </p><p>        /028W </p><p>                  ------------------7F56FF  271306Z /38 </p><p>P 271307Z NOV 92 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ZAGREB </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 2834 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY BELGRADE </p><p>AMEMBASSY ANKARA </p><p>AMEMBASSY ATHENS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BONN </p><p>AMEMBASSY BRUSSELS </p><p>AMEMBASSY BUDAPEST </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY MADRID </p><p>AMEMBASSY MOSCOW </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE </p><p>AMEMBASSY VIENNA </p><p>USMISSION USNATO </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION USVIENNA </p><p>USIA WASHDC 2476 </p><p> COMSIXTHFLT//N2// </p><p>CINCUSNAVEUR LONDON UK//N2/N22// </p><p>USEUCOM VAIHINGEN GM//ECJ3/ECJ5// </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ZAGREB  02517  04 OF 06  271306Z </p><p>CTF SIXZERO//N2// </p><p>CTF SIXONE//N2// </p><p>CTF SIXTWO//N2// </p><p>CTF SIXSEVEN//JOCC// </p><p>FOSIF ROTA SP </p><p>USEC BRUSSELS </p><p>WHITE HOUSE WASHDC 1098 </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 04 OF 06 ZAGREB 02517 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>GENEVA FOR USDEL ICFY - JACKOVICH </p><p> </p><p>10.  TUDJMAN SAID THE BOSNIAN CROATS HAD TAKEN UP </p><p>ARMS BECAUSE THEY FELT THREATENED BY SERBIAN </p><p>AGGRESSION AND BECAUSE THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN </p><p>SARAJEVO HAD NOT PREPARED ADEQUATELY TO DEFEND THEM. </p><p>THE BOSNIAN CROATS INITIALLY FELT SO ENDANGERED THAT </p><p>MANY OF THEM WERE ADVOCATING SECESSION AND JOINING </p><p>CROATIA.  IT WAS THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT, TUDJMAN </p><p>SAID, WHICH HAD BLUNTED THE SECESSION MOVE AND </p><p>STRONGLY URGED BOSNIAN CROATS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE </p><p>B-H INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM.  ULTIMATELY, BOSNIA\'S </p><p>CROATS WERE THE FIRST TO OPPOSE SERBIAN AGGRESSION. </p><p>ONLY LATER HAD THE MUSLIMS JOINED IN IN A SIGNIFICANT </p><p>WAY. </p><p> </p><p>11.  TUDJMAN SAID CATEGORICALLY THAT THERE WERE NO </p><p>CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN CROATIA AND, AS FAR AS HE </p><p>KNEW, NONE IN THE CROATIAN-DEFENDED AREAS OF B-H. </p><p>DURING THE WAR WITH THE YUGOSLAV ARMY LAST YEAR, </p><p>CROATIA HAD HAD SEVERAL POW CAMPS BUT THOSE WERE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02517  04 OF 06  271306Z </p><p>CLOSED WHEN THE PRISONERS WERE EXCHANGED.  TUDJMAN </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE HAD BEEN INDIVIDUAL CASES OF </p><p>VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CROATIA BY EXTREMISTS, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAD CALLED ON THE </p><p>PEOPLE TO ACT RESPONSIBLY.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY </p><p>WAS STRICT RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL THE PEOPLE </p><p>OF CROATIA.  LATER IN THE CONVERSATION, DEPUTY </p><p>PREMIER GRANIC CLARIFIED THAT THE BOSNIAN CROATS </p><p>MAINTAINED THREE DETENTION CAMPS, ALL OF WHICH HAD </p><p>BEEN VISITED BY THE ICRC.  MATE BOBAN, AT "GENEVA\'S" </p><p>REQUEST, HAD ORDERED ALL THREE CLOSED.  GRANIC SAID </p><p>CROATIA HAD ONLY SOME 30 SERBIAN PRISONERS, WHO HAD </p><p>BEEN AWAITING EXCHANGE WITH SERBIA -- BUT PANIC HAD </p><p>BEEN UNABLE TO DELIVER. </p><p> </p><p>12.  TUDJMAN STATED THAT CROATIA HAD NO TERRITORIAL </p><p>DESIGNS ON B-H.  HOWEVER, CROATIA IS VITALLY </p><p>INTERESTED IN B-H DEVELOPMENTS928,& 59 &39-POLITICAL </p><p>AND HISTORICAL REALITIES.  A B-H SOLUTION BASED ON </p><p>THE THREE CONSTITUENT PEOPLES DID NOT MEAN DIVISION </p><p>INTO THREE TERRITORIAL UNITS.

GRANIC SAID CROATIA WAS </p><p>EXTREMELY PERPLEXED BY CRITICISM OF CROATIA\'S </p><p>SUPPOSEDLY CLOSED BORDERS.  THE FACT IS THAT </p><p>CROATIA\'S ARE THE ONLY OPEN BORDERS IN THE REGION. </p><p>SINCE CROATIA HAD INSTITUTED ITS BORDER "CONTROLS" ON </p><p>JULY 13, SOME 100,000 BOSNIAN REFUGEES HAD ARRIVED IN </p><p>CROATIA AND ANOTHER 100,000 HAD TRANSITTED.  CROATIA </p><p>IS ALSO TAKING IN HUNDREDS OF EX-DETAINEES FROM THE </p><p>SERBIAN PRISON CAMPS IN B-H.  GRANIC REITERATED </p><p>CROATIA\'S APPRECIATION FOR THE MATERIAL HELP IT HAD </p><p>RECEIVED, BUT HE STRESSED THAT CROATIA ALSO NEEDS </p><p>MONEY TO PAY FOR ELECTRICITY, GASOLINE AND OTHER </p><p>REFUGEE-RELATED DIRECT COSTS -- NOW RUNNING AT 110 </p><p>MILLION DOLLARS PER MONTH. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ZAGREB  02517  06 OF 06  271309Z </p><p>RELATIONS WITH CROATIANS OF SERBIAN NATIONALITY </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>19.  CROATIA WANTS TO SEE AN END TO AGGRESSION AND A </p><p>RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE, INCLUDING NORMALIZATION OF </p><p>RELATIONS WITH SERBS IN CROATIA, TUDJMAN SAID.  HE </p><p>POINTED OUT THAT CROATIA HAD PASSED LAWS ON ABOLITION </p><p>(FOR THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE WAR AGAINST </p><p>CROATIA BUT DID NOT COMMIT WAR CRIMES) AND AMNESTY </p><p>(FOR THOSE ALREADY INDICTED OR SENTENCED FOR NON-WAR </p><p>CRIMES ACTS COMMITTED IN THE WAR).  HE EMPHASIZED THE </p><p>EFFORTS HIS GOVERNMENT WAS MAKING TOWARD RESTORATION </p><p>OF LAW AND ORDER THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  THE </p><p>CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAD WORKED TO REIN IN CROATIAN </p><p>EXTREMISTS AND HAD SEVERAL OF THEM WERE UNDER </p><p>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.  VICE PRESIDENT OF THE </p><p>PARLIAMENT DUKIC, A SERBIAN HIMSELF, POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>THE SERBS IN THE UNPAS ARE UNDER THE DOMINATION OF </p><p>THE 5-10 PERCENT EXTREMISTS WHO ARE CONTROLLED BY </p><p>BELGRADE. </p><p> </p><p>20.  IN CONCLUSION, PRESIDENT TUDJMAN TOLD THE CODEL </p><p>THAT CROATIA IS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY AND TO </p><p>A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, INCLUDING A FREE PRESS. </p><p> </p><p>NEITZKE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
