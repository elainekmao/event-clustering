<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001414 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/19/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ASEC, IZ, VM, YM </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN: FORMER IRAQI AMBASSADOR TO VIETNAM ARRIVES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 163627 </p><p> </p><p>     B. SANAA 1351 </p><p>     C. SANAA 1260 </p><p>     D. SANAA 1259 </p><p>     E. SANAA 1139 </p><p>     F. SANAA 898 </p><p>     G. STATE 102827 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Charges D\'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer for Reasons 1.5 ( </p><p>b,c,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF)  On June 18, before a meeting with FM Qirbi (see </p><p>septels), Charge </p><p>delivered the USG response to the ROYG request for </p><p>information on Salah </p><p>al-Muktar, the Saddam-era Iraqi Ambassador to Vietnam, to </p><p>Abdul Hakim </p><p>al-Iryani, Advisor to Foreign Minister Qirbi.  Iryani noted </p><p>that the text (see </p><p>para 4) appeared rather ambivalent, and did not explicitly </p><p>answer the key </p><p>question on Muktar\'s affiliation with the Iraqi Intelligence </p><p>Service. </p><p>Iryani also confirmed that Muktar arrived in Sanaa on Monday, </p><p>June 16, and </p><p>is in the care of a group of Iraqis living in Sanaa. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF)  FM Qirbi opened the 6/18 meeting with a plea for </p><p>a quicker response </p><p>to ROYG\'s requests for information.  Qirbi noted that some </p><p>Iraqi officials </p><p>whose names ROYG submitted to the U.S. for vetting (see </p><p>septels) have since </p><p>pulled their applications for asylum in Yemen, but did not </p><p>offer specifics. </p><p>ROYG faces a potential problem, said Qirbi, because some </p><p>Iraqis are coming into </p><p>the country without advising ROYG in advance -- Iraqis, like </p><p>some other Arab </p><p>nationals, do not require visas to enter Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF)  During a telcon with PolOff on 6/16, Iryani said </p><p>the next request </p><p>for USG vetting would include a high-level diplomat </p><p>(Ambassador or </p><p>DCM-equivalant) from Azerbiajan.  Post expects to receive the </p><p>new list, as well </p><p>as contact information for the ROYG mission in Baghdad, on </p><p>Saturday, June 21. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S rel Yemen)  Text delivered to ROYG on 6/18: </p><p> </p><p>(Begin text) </p><p> </p><p>We conducted traces on Salah al-Mukhtar, an Iraqi who has </p><p>requested asylum from </p><p>the Government of Yemen.
