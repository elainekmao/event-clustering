<p>S E C R E T SANAA 001879 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PTER, ASEC, MARR, PARM, PGOV, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM, ECON/COM, ENERGY, TERFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: SALEH DEMARCHE ON AL-MOAYED AND CT SUPPORT </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, Reasons 1.5 (b and d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (S) SUMMARY:  President Saleh July 30 pressed Ambassador </p><p>and Legatt-designate for an arrangement on al-Moayed to avoid </p><p>political embarrassment to Yemen.  Legatt briefed Saleh on </p><p>FBI proposal for Yemeni investigators to come to New York and </p><p>cooperate on al-Moayed case.  Saleh also pressed for </p><p>additional CT resources.  Ambassador briefed Saleh on pending </p><p>contract for Marib power plant that would adversely affect </p><p>American investment in Yemen.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) At President Saleh\'s request, Ambassador, ORCA Chief </p><p>and Legatt-designate met with him July 30.  Ambassador </p><p>presented Saleh initially with chart that depicted history of </p><p>American company Delma\'s effort to win contract for Marib </p><p>power plant.  Chart outlined steps since 1998 that Delma had </p><p>taken in accordance with Yemeni contracting procedure only to </p><p>be informed recently that a Yemeni company (NATCO) was to be </p><p>awarded the contract on the basis of its bid which appeared </p><p>to be based on and marginally improved Delma\'s offer. </p><p>Ambassador emphasized that virtually no American business </p><p>would be interested in investment in Yemen if Delma\'s </p><p>multi-million dollar effort was frustrated due to </p><p>irregularities in the Yemen bid process.  Saleh took the </p><p>point and phoned the Minister of Electricity to direct that </p><p>all documents be forwarded to the President\'s office for </p><p>review. </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Saleh then raised next tranche of ORCA support for </p><p>Yemen\'s counter terrorism effort.  ORCA chief briefed Saleh </p><p>on recent discussions with PSO Chief Gamish and reiterated </p><p>documentation required.  It was agreed that Yemeni government </p><p>would provide bank statements as needed. </p><p> </p><p>4. (S) Saleh then turned to al-Moayed case and reviewed his </p><p>telcon with FBI Director Mueller and "understanding" that US </p><p>and Yemen would cooperate in resolving the issue.  Saleh </p><p>argued that al-Moayed was an unimportant personality, unlike </p><p>other al-Qa\'ida figures like Nashiri, and that political cost </p><p>to ROYG and US of his extradition outweighed potential CT </p><p>gain.  In response, Legatt-designate briefed Saleh on letter </p><p>now being translated from him to Interior Minister Alimi </p><p>which would provide basis of US case and an invitation to </p><p>three Yemeni officials to come to New York to work with the </p><p>prosecutors and FBI case agents, on al-Moayed\'s case. </p><p>Legatt-designate stressed importance of al-Moayed and </p><p>corroborating evidence from several sources of his </p><p>association with Al-Qa\'ida.  Ambassador noted that </p><p>al-Moayed\'s crime involved collecting funds in the US and </p><p>from Americans which reinforced US determination to pursue </p><p>his case vigorously. </p><p> </p><p>5. (S) Saleh agreed that Interior Minister Alimi, </p><p>Legatt-designate and Ambassador should work further to </p><p>determine how to deal with the issue. He emphasized the </p><p>political embarrassment the ROYG will suffer if al-Moyad is </p><p>extradited.  He agreed to study the FBI invitation but did </p><p>not commit to sending a Yemeni team.  Ambassador noted that </p><p>al-Moayed was associated with the Islah party which had </p><p>several suspect associations including Sheikh Abdul Magid </p><p>Zindani with al-Qa\'ida and the Al Aqsa fund which financed </p><p>Hammas.  Within Palestinian circles, it was known that Islah </p><p>fundraising for Palestine was rife with corruption.  ROYG </p><p>should not associate itself with the Islah party and </p><p>specifically al-Moayed, Ambassador advised. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) Legatt-designate briefed Saleh on ongoing training of </p><p>Interior Ministry officials on crime scene investigation and </p><p>conveyed personal greetings from FBI Director Mueller.  Saleh </p><p>expressed interest and appreciation for the training and </p><p>reciprocated Muller\'s greetings. </p><p> </p><p>7. (S) COMMENT:  Saleh remains personally engaged on the </p><p>al-Moayed case.  The sheikh\'s charitable works in Sana\'a have </p><p>made him a popular figure here.  Saleh continues to hope that </p><p>his extradition to the US can be avoided and it will take </p><p>continuing effort on our part to get the ROYG to acquiesce </p><p>and work with the USG.  Ambassador and Legatt-designate will </p><p>follow up with Interior Minister and try to move toward </p><p>US-Yemeni cooperation rather than confrontation. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
