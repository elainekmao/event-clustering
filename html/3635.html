<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002016 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR PA/OBS/P (NANCY RILEY) </p><p> </p><p>INFO AF/PD (COX), AF/S (SCHLACHTER), AF, EB </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC </p><p>SUBJECT: RESULTS REPORT: AUGUST 30 INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH U/S ALAN LARSON </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   This program was extremely useful and successful -- </p><p>    one of the best interactive programs we have had.  U/S </p><p>    Larson\'s hard-hitting yet respectful exegesis on the </p><p>    biotech issue was absolutely on target.  We were </p><p>    particularly impressed with Larson\'s quick and thoughtful </p><p>    reaction when one of our panelists tried to inject out-of- </p><p>    context information into his comment/question.  U/S </p><p>    Larson\'s firm but polite clarification of the real issue at </p><p>    hand, the complete absence of scientific evidence that </p><p>    biotech maize carries health risks, was perfect. </p><p> </p><p>2.   Our audience of about 30 included journalists, a </p><p>    representative from the Zimbabwean Ministry of Agriculture, </p><p>    a representative from one of Zimbabwe\'s leading seed </p><p>    companies, agricultural researchers from the University of </p><p>    Zimbabwe, an official from the Zimbabwe Bureau of </p><p>    Standards, and a farmer.  Before the program the audience </p><p>    was roughly one-third pro-biotechnology, one third anti- </p><p>    biotechnology, and one-third wait-and-see.  By the </p><p>    program\'s end, the "wait-and-see" members of our audience </p><p>    were largely persuaded that biotech food does not present a </p><p>    health risk and should be used to meet Zimbabwe\'s food </p><p>    crisis.  As seems common, the anti-biotechnology people </p><p>    were not terribly interested in scientific data. </p><p> </p><p>3.   We used the technical pause at the beginning of the </p><p>    program to begin a dialogue with our audience that </p><p>    continued after the program ended.  In that discussion the </p><p>    pro-biotechnology people were categorical about the need </p><p>    for Zimbabwe to make a policy decision on BT food, a </p><p>    decision they hoped would provide food for the nation\'s </p><p>    hungry.  Their arguments were well constructed, echoed what </p><p>    U/S Larson had said and, in our opinion, carried the field. </p><p>    Our anti-biotechnology participants could do no better than </p><p>    to fall back on the argument that BT crops would "put small </p><p>    Zimbabwean farmers at the mercy of international seed </p><p>    companies."  Fortunately, one of the agricultural </p><p>    researchers pointed out that Zimbabwe has been using hybrid </p><p>    maize seed, purchased from seed companies, for 60 years. </p><p>    In the end, the pro- and anti-biotechnology factions simply </p><p>    had to agree to disagree.  Significantly, the issue of </p><p>    biotech safety was not a major point of argument in the </p><p>    post-program discussion. Score one point for science. </p><p> </p><p>4.   The program\'s effectiveness was enhanced by an article </p><p>    carried in the September 1 Sunday Mirror (independent, pro- </p><p>    government weekly).  The article accurately quoted U/S </p><p>    Larson and dispassionately presented US policy on </p><p>    biotechnology and agricultural development in Africa. </p><p> </p><p>5.   Post made further use of the program by distributing </p><p>    the transcript to Zimbabwean editors and other opinion </p><p>    leaders on September 2.  We will report further use of the </p><p>    transcript as it occurs. </p><p> </p><p>6.   Two factors made this program especially successful: </p><p>    The skill and expertise of U/S Larson and the active </p><p>    participation of only two posts.  In spite of the time lost </p><p>    at the top of the program, the participation of only two </p><p>    posts allowed our audience and panelists a thorough </p><p>    discussion of the topic at hand.  Many thanks for an </p><p>    excellent program. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
