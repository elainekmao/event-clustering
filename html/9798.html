<p>UNCLAS AMMAN 004761 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: BEXP, ETRD, KPAO, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEET U.S. FOLLOW-UP:  JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: USDOC 3592 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (u)  Embassy appreciates DOC feedback from the first MEET </p><p>U.S. conference.  Regarding the proposed issue areas for </p><p>future MEET U.S. programs listed reftel, we believe it will </p><p>be easy to find a solid group of qualified applicants for </p><p>virtually any sector-specific program.  Reftel suggestions </p><p>for education services, health technologies, irrigation and </p><p>water treatment technologies, airport and port management, </p><p>hotel management, and hospitality/tourism would all be </p><p>welcome programs in Jordan.  We might expand the irrigation </p><p>proposal to include environmental technologies more broadly </p><p>(in keeping with the Environmental provisions of the </p><p>Jordan-U.S. FTA), and would add banking/financial services </p><p>and health sector services/hospital management to the list. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (u)  Regarding format options, Embassy would be happy to </p><p>continue recruitment of participants for group programs.  We </p><p>would also be willing to support an internship program as </p><p>outlined reftel.  Support for either, as noted reftel, would </p><p>be dependent on available MEPI funding. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (u)  Embassy looks forward to working with DOC on the </p><p>MEET U.S. program as it develops. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
