<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 15380 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, KPAL, KISL, IS </p><p>SUBJECT:  ISLAMIC JIHAD:  TOTAL REJECTION OF PEACE </p><p>          PROCESS BUT NO VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p>REF:  TEL AVIV 15327 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY  AN ISLAMIC JIHAD ACTIVIST LAID OUT AN </p><p>UNCOMPROMISING VIEW OF HIS ORGANIZATION\'S OPPOSITION TO </p><p>THE PEACE PROCESS AND FUTURE AIMS.  WHILE CRITICAL OF </p><p>PALESTINIANS ENGAGED IN THE CURRENT DIALOGUE, THE </p><p>ACTIVIST ASSERTED THAT HIS GROUP WOULD NOT EMPLOY </p><p>VIOLENCE TO STOP THE PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  IN THE EMBASSY\'S FIRST CONTACT WITH ISLAMIC JIHAD, </p><p>POLOFF MET WITH ACTIVIST "MAHMOUD" DURING A NOVEMBER 21 </p><p>VISIT TO GAZA.  THE MEETING WAS ARRANGED THROUGH AN </p><p>EMBASSY JOURNALIST CONTACT WHO HAS LINKS TO BOTH ISLAMIC </p><p>JIHAD AND "HAMAS."  POLOFF\'S JOURNALIST CONTACT TOLD </p><p>POLOFF THAT HE HAD TRIED TO SET UP MEETINGS WITH ISLAMIC </p><p>JIHAD REPRESENTATIVES BUT THAT THE ORGANIZATION HAD </p><p>REFUSED TO MEET WITH AMERICANS.  UNBEKNOWNST TO POLOFF </p><p>AND GAZA JOURNALIST CONTACT, THE ISLAMIC JIHAD ACTIVIST </p><p>SHOWED UP AT THE JOURNALIST\'S OFFICE AFTER POLOFF AND </p><p>CONTACT HAD RETURNED FROM MEETING "HAMAS" LEADER MAHMOUD </p><p>AL-ZAHAR.  POLOFF TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO </p><p>PROBE ABOUT ISLAMIC JIHAD POLICY TOWARD THE PEACE </p><p>PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>4.  REFUSING TO DIVULGE HIS REAL NAME OR THE BRANCH OF </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD HE BELONGED TO, "MAHMOUD" SAID HIS </p><p>ORGANIZATION TRADITIONALLY SAW NO BENEFIT TO MEETING </p><p>WITH USG REPRESENTATIVES GIVEN THE "CRIMINAL" APPROACH </p><p>THE US HAS TAKEN TOWARD THE ARAB/ISRAELI DISPUTE AND THE </p><p>ISLAMIC WORLD.  NONETHELESS, HE AGREED TO LAY OUT </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD\'S POSITION ON THE CURRENT PEACE PROCESS </p><p>LEST THERE BE ANY MISUNDERSTANDING.  THROUGHOUT THE </p><p>SESSION, "MAHMOUD" REMAINED CORDIAL AND CALM, ALLOWING </p><p>POLOFF TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>NO COMPROMISE </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  IN A GIVE-AND-TAKE THAT LASTED ONE-HALFHOUR, </p><p>"MAHMOUD" OFFERED A SCATHING INDICTMENT OF CURRENT US </p><p>EFFORTS TO DIVIDE THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND OFFER NOTHING </p><p>MORE THAN "CRUMBS" TO PALESTINIANS IN THE FORM OF </p><p>AUTONOMY AND PERHAPS EVENTUAL CONFEDERATION WITH </p><p>JORDAN.  ISLAMIC JIHAD, HE SAID, TOTALLY REJECTS ANY </p><p>APPROACH THAT LEAVES ISRAEL IN CONTROL OF ANY </p><p>"PALESTINIAN TERRITORY-"  ISLAMIC JIHAD\'S GOAL IS AN </p><p>ISLAMIC STATE ENCOMPASSING ALL OF THE WEST BANK, GAZA, </p><p>AND ISRAEL IN WHICH ISRAELI JEWS WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE </p><p>AS "PROTECTED SUBJECTS" AS THEY HAD UNDER MUSLIM RULE </p><p>FOR CENTURIES. </p><p> </p><p>6.  "MAHMOUD" ASSERTED THAT, IF NECESSARY, HIS CHILDREN </p><p>AND GRANDCHILDREN COULD LIVE WITH THE STATUS QUO. </p><p>ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC JIHAD, THE END OF ISRAEL AS A </p><p>JEWISH STATE IS INEVITABLE.  HE SAID MUSLIMS HAVE ONLY </p><p>TO LOOK TO THE END OF THE BRITISH, IRANIAN, AND SOVIET </p><p>EMPIRES FOR RECENT EXAMPLES OF EVENTS THAT WERE ONCE </p><p>THOUGHT "UNIMAGINABLE."  MUSLIMS RETAIN THE KORAN AS AN </p><p>UNCHANGING LODESTONE AND CAN BE VERY PATIENT, HE SAID. </p><p> </p><p>NO VIOLENCE TO OPPOSE PEACE PROCESS </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. ASKED IF ISLAMIC JIHAD WOULD USE VIOLENCE AGAINST </p><p>THOSE PALESTINIANS ENGAGED IN THE CURRENT DISCUSSIONS </p><p>WITH ISRAEL, "MAHMOUD" SAID ISLAMIC JIHAD, WHILE </p><p>CONTINUING TO CRITICIZE CURRENT EFFORTS, WOULD NOT </p><p>ACTIVELY OPPOSE PALESTINIAN EFFORTS TO GET A SOLUTION. </p><p>HE SAID THE ORGANIZATION, IN ANY CASE, WOULD NOT USE </p><p>VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHER PALESTINIANS.  HOWEVER, IF </p><p>PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATIVES DID ANYTHING THAT SMACKED OF </p><p>A SELLOUT OF ANY ASPECT OF PALESTINIAN INTERESTS, </p><p>ISLAMIC JIHAD WOULD BRING TO BEAR "ALL OTHER INFLUENCES </p><p>IT HAD."  HE REPEATED THAT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD IS NOT </p><p>A COURSE ISLAMIC JIHAD WOULD PURSUE. </p><p> </p><p>8.  COMMENT:  THE COMMENTS BY THIS ISLAMIC JIHAD </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE LEAVE NO ROOM FOR COMPROMISE, IN CONTRAST </p><p>TO THE BIT OF DAYLIGHT SUGGESTED BY "HAMAS" LEADER </p><p>AL-ZAHAR (REF).  DESPITE STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE </p><p>CURRENT PEACE EFFORTS, BOTH ISLAMIC ORGANIZATIONS HAVE </p><p>TOLD US THEY WILL NOT USE VIOLENCE TO STOP THE PROCESS. </p><p>WHETHER THOSE DISAVOWALS HOLD UP IN THE FACE OF PROGRESS </p><p>IN THE NEGOTIATIONS REMAINS TO BE SEEN. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BROWN </p><p></p></div>
