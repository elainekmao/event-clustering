CLASSIFIED BY ECON/C CLAIRE PIERANGELO, REASONS 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY: DURING RECENT MEETINGS AND </p><p>CONVERSATIONS WITH VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS, U.S. TECHNICAL </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01384  01 OF 02  301039Z </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS, AND OTHER LEGAL AND ECONOMIC EXPERTS, </p><p>WE HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES WE SEE </p><p>UNDERWAY THAT CAN BE DIRECTLY CREDITED TO THE NEED TO </p><p>FULFILL COMMITMENTS UNDER THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT </p><p>(BTA) AND WHICH ARE BEING MADE POSSIBLE WITH THE HELP USG </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.  THESE CHANGES ARE BUILDING </p><p>ON THE CHANGES UNDERWAY IN VIETNAM\'S OVERALL ECONOMIC </p><p>REFORM EFFORTS. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE MISSION\'S AND </p><p>WASHINGTON AGENCIES\' WORK IS BEGINNING TO PAY OFF, </p><p>SOMETIMES IN OBVIOUS WAYS BUT ALSO IN MORE SUBTLE WAYS. </p><p>THIS CABLE FOCUSES ON THE LEGAL REFORM EFFORT AND THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, IN PARTICULAR, HOW THE BTA HAS BECOME </p><p>A TOOL FOR THE MOJ TO EFFECT CHANGE WITHIN THE MINISTRY AS </p><p>WELL AS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT. MINISTER OF JUSTICE NGUYEN </p><p>DINH LOC IS TRAVELING TO THE U.S. JUNE 1-8 FOR MEETINGS </p><p>WITH USG AND PRIVATE SECTOR OFFICIALS AS PART OF A JOINT </p><p>U.S.-VIETNAM TRADE COUNCIL-UNDP SPONSORED TRIP.  A SEPARATE </p><p>CABLE WILL REPORT ON CHANGES UNDERWAY IN THE STATE BANK OF </p><p>VIETNAM.  END INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE BTA AS A TOOL OF CHANGE </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE IS A NEW BODY, HAVING BEEN </p><p>ABOLISHED BY THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT IN THE LATE 1970\'S </p><p>AND WAS ONLY RE-ESTABLISHED 10 YEARS AGO.  MINISTER LOC HAS </p><p>BEEN AT THE HELM THROUGHOUT. MOJ\'S POWER BASE AND POSITION </p><p>WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE ARE SLOWLY EVOLVING.  AT </p><p>THE RECENT MEETING OF THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL TRADE </p><p>AGREEMENT JOINT COMMITTEE IN HANOI, DELEGATION MEMBERS WERE </p><p>CLEARLY IMPRESSED BY THE WELL-PREPARED, PROFESSIONAL AND </p><p>FRANK PARTICIPATION BY MOJ OFFICIALS.  EVEN MORE STRIKING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01384  01 OF 02  301039Z </p><p>WAS THE CLEAR LINK THAT MOJ AND OTHER MINISTRIES\' OFFICIALS </p><p>MADE BETWEEN THEIR WORK ON IMPLEMENTING THE LEGAL AND OTHER </p><p>COMMITMENTS IN THE BTA, THE HELP OF THE ONGOING USG </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN THESE AREAS, AND THE MORE </p><p>GENERAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM EFFORTS UNDERWAY IN </p><p>VIETNAM TODAY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) THE BTA, BY VIRTUE OF THE LEGAL COMMITMENTS IT </p><p>CONTAINS, IS BEING USED BY THE MOJ (AND OTHER MINISTRIES) </p><p>TO PROMOTE CHANGE WITHIN THEIR OWN ORGANIZATIONS. IT IS NO </p><p>COINCIDENCE THAT MOJ, PREVIOUSLY A MORIBUND AGENCY WITH </p><p>LIMITED AUTHORITY AND A LIMITED MANDATE, IS NOW IN THE </p><p>CENTER OF THE BTA IMPLEMENTATION EFFORT.  CLEARLY THE </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BTA AND THE INCREASED TECHNICAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY THE U.S. AND OTHER DONORS ARE </p><p>CONTRIBUTING TO THE GREATER ENTHUSIASM, COMPETENCE, </p><p>AUTHORITY, AND IMPORTANCE OF THE MOJ.  THIS IS A POSITIVE </p><p>MOVE TOWARD THE RULE BY LAW IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>NEW RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MOJ LEADING TO GREATER INFLUENCE </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS OF THE BTA, THE MOJ HAD </p><p>ONLY LIMITED INPUT.  HOWEVER, AFTER THE BTA WAS SIGNED </p><p>(JULY 2000), THE PRIME MINISTER INSTRUCTED MOJ TO BEGIN A </p><p>REVIEW OF ALL LEGAL DOCUMENTS (LAWS, DECREES, ORDINANCES, </p><p>ETC.) IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY WHICH ONES NEEDED TO BE REVISED </p><p>IN ORDER TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BTA.  AFTER THE </p><p>REVIEW, WHICH INCLUDED 148 LEGAL DOCUMENTS, MOJ SUGGESTED </p><p>REVISIONS TO 24, PROPOSED 39 NEW DOCUMENTS, AND RECOMMENDED </p><p>9 TO BE CANCELLED.  MOJ HAS NOW BEEN ASKED TO REVIEW LOCAL </p><p>LEVEL LEGAL DOCUMENTS IN THE SAME MANNER.  ALTHOUGH A </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HANOI  01384  01 OF 02  301039Z </p><p>SIMPLE SOUNDING OPERATION, PRIOR TO THAT TIME MOJ HAD NOT </p><p>BEEN GIVEN AUTHORITY TO REVIEW LEGAL DOCUMENTS PROMULGATED </p><p>BY OTHER MINISTRIES AND HAD NO MANDATE TO REVIEW LEGAL </p><p>DOCUMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, EVEN IF JUST TO ENSURE </p><p>CONSISTENCY WITH NATIONAL LAW.  MINISTRIES, AGENCIES, </p><p>PROVINCES, AND COMMUNES TRADITIONALLY CAN PROPOSE LAWS TO </p><p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND ISSUE DECREES, ORDINANCES, ETC. </p><p>ON THEIR OWN AUTHORITY. SOME MINISTERIAL OR PROVINCIAL </p><p>DECREES AND ORDINANCES NEED THE PRIME MINISTER\'S APPROVAL </p><p>BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE CLEARANCE OR CONCURRENCE OF OTHER </p><p>MINISTRIES OR AGENCIES.  AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, OFTEN THERE IS </p><p>NO REVIEW OR APPROVAL PROCESS AT ALL.  THIS LACK OF REVIEW </p><p>CONTRIBUTES TO OVERLAPPING, CONTRADICTORY, AND INCONSISTENT </p><p>LEGAL DOCUMENTS.  THIS YEAR, MOJ WAS ALSO PUT IN CHARGE OF </p><p>A MAJOR EFFORT CALLED THE "LEGAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT", A 10- </p><p>YEAR PLAN ON THE FULL RANGE OF LEGAL REFORMS NEEDED IF </p><p>VIETNAM INTENDS TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY INTO THE REGIONAL </p><p>AND WORLD ECONOMY, INCLUDING POSSIBLE WTO ACCESSION.  THIS </p><p>ASSESSMENT GOES BEYOND JUST BTA IMPLEMENTATION AND </p><p>ADDRESSES A WIDE RANGE OF LEGAL ISSUES IN VIETNAM. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ9249 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HANOI  01384  02 OF 02  301039Z </p><p>ACTION SS-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   ANHR-00  TEDE-00  JUSE-00  STR-00   SAS-00 </p><p>        /000W </p><p>                  ------------------B59E1D  301040Z /38 </p><p>O 301026Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 6624 </p><p>INFO ASEAN COLLECTIVE </p><p>DEPT OF JUSTICE WASHDC </p><p>USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPTTREAS WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HANOI 001384 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR DEPSEC ARMITAGE </p><p>STATE PASS USTR FOR HUNTSMAN/IVES/BRYAN </p><p>STATE PASS USAID FOR BALLANTYNE </p><p>JUSTICE FOR AAG VIET DINH </p><p> </p><p>THE VALUE-ADDED FROM USG TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) THE USG\'S DAY TO DAY WORK ON LEGAL REFORM EFFORTS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HANOI  01384  02 OF 02  301039Z </p><p>IN VIETNAM IS NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS TO OTHER DONORS OR THE GVN </p><p>BUT FROM WHAT WE ARE SEEING, WE BELIEVE THAT THE EFFECT IS </p><p>REAL AND GOES BEYOND THE MERE ECONOMIC. THE ISSUE OF </p><p>TRANSPARENCY IS A CASE IN POINT.  THE GVN IS IN THE PROCESS </p><p>OF AMENDING ITS "LAW ON LAWS" ("THE LAW ON PROMULGATION OF </p><p>LEGAL DOCUMENTS") WHICH GUIDES THE OVERALL PROCESS FOR </p><p>LEGISLATION AND RULEMAKING IN ALL AREAS FOR VIETNAM.  THIS </p><p>EFFORT HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN AS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS IN THE BTA.  THE USG AT SEVERAL </p><p>LEVELS - EMBASSY, WASHINGTON AGENCIES AND USG-FUNDED </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE - IS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN THIS </p><p>EFFORT THROUGH CONSULTATION AND GUIDANCE.  WHILE THE </p><p>EMBASSY\'S AND WASHINGTON AGENCIES\' EFFORTS ARE SIGNIFICANT, </p><p>PERHAPS THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK COMES FROM THE </p><p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED THROUGH TWO USAID-FUNDED </p><p>PROGRAMS - THE STAR PROJECT AND U.S.-VIETNAM TRADE COUNCIL </p><p>PROGRAM.  THESE PROGRAMS HAVE GIVEN US ADDITIONAL ACCESS </p><p>ROUTES TO THE GVN, ESPECIALLY IN SOME SENSITIVE AREAS.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, WE WERE ABLE TO OFFER ONLY GENERAL COMMENTS TO THE </p><p>GVN REGARDING OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR TRANSPARENCY PROVISIONS </p><p>IN THE AMENDED LAW ON LAWS, BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE </p><p>THE DRAFT IN PROGRESS.  HOWEVER, THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TURNED TO THE STAR PROJECT FOR </p><p>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT AND GAVE STAR A COPY. THUS STAR WAS </p><p>ABLE TO COMMENT ON SPECIFICS OF THE LAW, IN PARTICULAR, </p><p>WHETHER THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS GO FAR ENOUGH TOWARD </p><p>MEETING VIETNAM\'S COMMITMENTS ON TRANSPARENCY UNDER THE </p><p>BTA.  WHILE THAT LAW IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS, WE FEEL </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT ALL THESE EFFORTS WILL HAVE A POSITIVE </p><p>IMPACT ON THE FINAL LAW AND ON GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN </p><p>VIETNAM. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HANOI  01384  02 OF 02  301039Z </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT OF OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE </p><p>ON LEGAL REFORM ISSUES IS EXPOSING VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS TO </p><p>THE U.S. AND U.S. OFFICIALS.  THE U.S.-VIETNAM TRADE </p><p>COUNCIL AND THE UNDP ARE JOINTLY SPONSORING THE U.S. VISIT </p><p>OF JUSTICE MINISTER LOC JUNE 1-8.  LOC WILL BE ACCOMPANIED </p><p>BY SOME OF HIS BEST STAFF AND WILL BE LOOKING AT LOCAL </p><p>ENFORCEMENT ISSUES AS WELL AS DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES </p><p>BETWEEN FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  THE LACK OF </p><p>CLEAR JURISDICTION AND DIVISION OF AUTHORITY IS A MAJOR </p><p>OBSTACLE TO LEGAL REFORM IN VIETNAM AND THIS VISIT WILL </p><p>HELP PROVIDE SOME NEW IDEAS ON HOW TO APPROACH THIS </p><p>DIFFICULT AND POLITICALLY SENSITIVE ISSUE. </p><p> </p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) LEGAL REFORM IN VIETNAM IS AN ONGOING EFFORT, BUT </p><p>ONE IN WHICH THE BTA AND USG TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ARE </p><p>PLAYING A POSITIVE AND IMPORTANT ROLE.  THE MORE WE CAN DO </p><p>TO ASSIST VIETNAM IN THIS AREA, THE MORE WE WILL BE ABLE TO </p><p>INFLUENCE THE PACE AND DIRECTION OF REFORM, WHICH WILL HAVE </p><p>POSITIVE EFFECTS ACROSS THE LEGAL SPECTRUM. </p><p>PORTER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
