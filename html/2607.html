<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 000820 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, KWMN, PHUM, IT, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  ITALY DEPORTS 152 TIP VICTIMS </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 358 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> 1.(SBU) The Italian Government on March 1 forcibly </p><p>repatriated 152 trafficking victims using two chartered </p><p>aircraft flown into Lagos.  RNLEO was at the Lagos airport </p><p>for oversight of NDLEA drug interdiction efforts and was able </p><p>to witness the arrival of the first Italian plane carrying 36 </p><p>women and girls.  Using two of the buses recently donated to </p><p>the Nigerian police by the Italian government (reftel), the </p><p>Anti-TIP Task Force received the returnees and transported </p><p>them to a temporary holding facility in Ikoyi, Lagos.  This </p><p>was soon after by the arrival of the second charter flight </p><p>carrying 116 women and girls.  These receptions required </p><p>heavy police security as traffickers and victims\' relatives </p><p>were at the airport attempting to gain access to the </p><p>trafficking victims. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(SBU) On March 4 INL FSN visited the police holding </p><p>facility and met with Superintendent of Police Joseph </p><p>Famakin, who works on the Police Anti-TIP Task Force. </p><p>Famakin, who had organized the police reception of the </p><p>returnees at the Lagos airport, claimed that the TIP victims </p><p>would be released shortly, into the custody of either </p><p>confirmed relatives or, if relatives were not located, to </p><p>liaison officers of their home state.  As is the norm with </p><p>the trafficking of Nigerian women and girls to Europe, the </p><p>vast majority of this group are from Edo State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(SBU) Famakin told INL FSN that screening of the deported </p><p>TIP victims had started almost immediately upon their arrival </p><p>at the police holding center -- screening for identities and </p><p>location of relatives, compulsory HIV/AIDS testing, and </p><p>interviews for possible criminal evidence to be used in </p><p>prosecuting the Nigerian traffickers responsible for the </p><p>large exodus of women and girls to brothels in Europe. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(SBU) Famakin stated that a particular challenge in this </p><p>screening process was determining a girl\'s or woman\'s true </p><p>identity since most traveled to Europe on fake or forged </p><p>documents given them by traffickers.  The returned </p><p>trafficking victims were also extremely reluctant to give </p><p>disclose the identities of their traffickers, as they </p><p>believed that voodoo rituals and native medicine they </p><p>submitted to prior to being trafficked would curse them and </p><p>result in their death or maiming if they gave criminal </p><p>information to the police.  Though the deported girls and </p><p>women were considered "victims" under the UN Protocol\'s </p><p>definition, most were witting of their future as prostitutes </p><p>in Europe when they depart Nigeria, claimed Famakin.  This </p><p>further hinders the returnees\' willingness to cooperate with </p><p>law enforcement authorities.  He expressed hope, however, </p><p>that the enactment of Nigeria\'s first TIP law (a draft bill </p><p>is being reviewed by the National Assembly) would make </p><p>prosecution of trafficking crimes easier, though he did not </p><p>elaborate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.(SBU) When contacted by RNLEO March 7, Famakin confirmed </p><p>that the last of the group of deportees had left the </p><p>detention facility for their homes in Edo State on March 6. </p><p>Girls and women who tested positive for HIV/AIDS were </p><p>released but ordered to present themselves to their state\'s </p><p>Health Department, purportedly for treatment and counseling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.(SBU) Comment:  The Federal Government has yet to match its </p><p>impressive anti-TIP rhetoric with adequate funds for even the </p><p>short-term care needed to cope with groups of rescued and </p><p>returned trafficking victims.  Longer-term shelter and </p><p>vocational training remains unavailable.  Therefore, on </p><p>average over half of returned TIP victims are re-trafficked </p><p>to Europe within weeks of being released from government </p><p>custody. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
