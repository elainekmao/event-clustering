<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001292 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ZIM CRISIS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "Pretoria becomes chief stumbling </p><p>      block", the independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated </p><p>      its June 24 editorial to encouraging South African </p><p>      President Thabo Mbeki to stop obstructing international </p><p>      efforts meant to resolve the deepening political and </p><p>      socioeconomic crisis in Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "After years of refusing to act on Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>      deepening political and economic crisis, the South African </p><p>      government is increasingly showing where its loyalties lie: </p><p>      with the Harare government.  At almost every international </p><p>      forum where the crisis is debated and solutions to it are </p><p>      sought, it is none other than Pretoria which always comes </p><p>      forward to blunt international pressure for the tough </p><p>      action to be taken against a rogue government that has </p><p>      rightly become a pariah in the world. . .While we accept </p><p>      that it is South Africa\'s right to chart a foreign policy </p><p>      of its choice, it is unacceptable that Pretoria should, on </p><p>      one hand, refuse to act against naked and widening </p><p>      injustices while, on the other hand, it also undermines </p><p>      every effort by others who want to end the madness. . .If </p><p>      Mbeki wants to be taken seriously by anyone on NEPAD, he </p><p>      must begin to show resolute and impartial action in </p><p>      resolving a long-festering problem right on his doorstep, </p><p>      or simply let those who have the wherewithal to get on top </p><p>      of an intolerable situation that is worsening by the hour. </p><p>      . .Mbeki must decide. . .whether he is for or against the </p><p>      struggle for democracy by the people of Zimbabwe.  In any </p><p>      struggle against tyranny and dictatorship, there should </p><p>      never be fence-sitters, and Mbeki would do well to decide </p><p>      where he </p><p>      belongs. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
