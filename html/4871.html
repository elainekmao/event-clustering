ON THE OTHER HAND, OUR PRINCIPAL </p><p>CONTACT AT THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT HAS SUGGESTED THAT A </p><p>WTO CASE MIGHT BE THE ONLY WAY TO RAISE THE ATTENTION OF EU </p><p>MEMBER STATES.  THIS OFFICIAL FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT A WELL </p><p>THOUGHT OUT CONSULTATIONS PERIOD COULD PROVE USEFUL IN ITALY </p><p>BECAUSE IT WOULD ENGAGE THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS ELEMENTS OF THE </p><p>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE PROBLEM.  VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN </p><p>TRADE URSO IS ALREADY EMERGING AS A VOCAL AND PUBLIC OPPONENT </p><p>OF AG MINISTER ALEMANNO, AND A WTO "THEATER" MIGHT USEFULLY </p><p>AMPLIFY HIS INFLUENCE. </p><p> </p><p>14. (C) EMBASSY RECOMMENDATION: WHETHER OR NOT WASHINGTON </p><p>DECIDES TO PURSUE A CASE IN THE WTO, WE RECOMMEND TESTING THE </p><p>LIMITS OF THE GOI\'S ABILITY TO PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE ON </p><p>BIOTECH DURING ITS EU PRESIDENCY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF </p><p>2003.  SPECIFICALLY, WE RECOMMEND A MARCH VISIT BY A HIGH </p><p>LEVEL USTR-STATE-USDA TEAM TO RAISE THE PROFILE OF BIOTECH ON </p><p>OUR BILATERAL AGENDA AND PRESS FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN </p><p>LONGSTANDING IRRITANTS, SUCH AS THE AMATO DECREE, IN ADVANCE </p><p>OF ITALY\'S ASSUMING THE EU PRESIDENCY.  WE WERE TOLD BY THE </p><p>MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT ON DECEMBER 4 THAT ITALY MAY HOLD A </p><p>EUROPEAN LEVEL CONFERENCE ON BIOTECHNOLOGY DURING ITS </p><p>PRESIDENCY, WHICH SUGGESTS A TIMELY USG VISIT COULD BE </p><p>PRODUCTIVE. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></div>
