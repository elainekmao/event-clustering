<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002998 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, TU, OSCE </p><p>SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS ASSOCIATION: "POLICE RAID A WARNING </p><p>TO KURDS AND TO GOT" </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 1624 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons 1.5 b and d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Police May 6 raided the Ankara offices of the </p><p>Human Rights Association (HRA), seizing records and computers </p><p>as part of an investigation of alleged support for terrorism. </p><p> The HRA President believes the action is an attempt to warn </p><p>NGOs and the GOT against supporting a planned conference on </p><p>the Kurdish problem.  Prosecutors have repeatedly taken the </p><p>HRA to court over the years, but have failed to prove ties to </p><p>terrorism.  GOT reaction will be reported septel.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Police Seize Records from Ankara Offices </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) On May 6 Ankara police raided both the national </p><p>headquarters and the branch office of the HRA, hauling away </p><p>numerous paper files, computer discs, and computers.  HRA </p><p>President Husnu Ondul told us 15 police and a State Security </p><p>Court prosecutor entered the headquarters shortly after 9 </p><p>a.m. and began searching and seizing documents.  He said the </p><p>prosecutor claimed the raid was part of an investigation of </p><p>the HRA for providing aid and shelter to an illegal </p><p>organization (Note: presumably referring to the terrorist </p><p>PKK. End Note).  Police later searched the Ankara branch </p><p>office.  Ondul claimed police did not keep detailed records </p><p>of the seized documents.  He said they include reports of </p><p>human rights violations by security officials, some of which </p><p>may reveal the names of the accusers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Raid Coincides with Meeting on EU Reform </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Ondul believes the action was staged by nationalist </p><p>elements of the military and intelligence services (i.e. the </p><p>Deep State) as a warning to the Kurdish community and the </p><p>GOT.  He noted that the raid took place on the same day he </p><p>and other NGO leaders were scheduled to meet with FM Gul to </p><p>discuss the GOT\'s plan for enacting human rights reform in </p><p>order to meet EU membership criteria.  Ondul averred that the </p><p>timing was no coincidence, and speculated that the raid was a </p><p>reaction to the well-known plans of the pro-Kurdish Democracy </p><p>People\'s Party (DEHAP) to organize a national conference on </p><p>the Kurdish problem.  DEHAP is seeking broad sponsorship for </p><p>the conference, which would include on its agenda the </p><p>possibility of an amnesty for PKK supporters and other </p><p>"political" prisoners.  Ondul believes the police action was </p><p>a warning to the GOT and NGOs against participating in the </p><p>conference or supporting any reform proposals it might </p><p>generate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>HRA Frequently Harassed, Attacked Over Years </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Ondul noted that over the years police and prosecutors </p><p>have frequently raided HRA offices and taken the organization </p><p>to court, but each closure case has ended in acquittal.  He </p><p>averred that this raid was yet the latest example of State </p><p>harassment; no legitimate evidence will be found and there </p><p>will be no convictions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) The HRA is Turkey\'s largest human rights organization, </p><p>with an estimated 14,000 members and 34 branches nationwide. </p><p>More than 400 court cases have been opened against the HRA </p><p>over the past two years.  In August, prosecutors indicted </p><p>Ondul and 46 other HRA leaders in an ongoing case tied to a </p><p>January 2001 raid of HRA headquarters.  Since the 1990s, 14 </p><p>HRA officials have been killed under suspicious </p><p>circumstances.  In 1998, then HRA President Akin Birdal was </p><p>shot and critically wounded in his Ankara office; a former </p><p>Jandarma sergeant was among those later convicted for the </p><p>attack. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (C) We think the timing of this raid is not a coincidence, </p><p>and it does appear to be a warning from nationalist elements </p><p>of the State.  This tactic is all too common in Turkey -- </p><p>reftel reports on the nearly simultaneous March 13 </p><p>announcements of the closing of the pro-Kurdish HADEP party </p><p>and the launching of a closure case against DEHAP.  Like the </p><p>HRA, HADEP and DEHAP have repeatedly been accused of </p><p>supporting terrorism.  However, despite intense scrutiny, </p><p>prosecutors have not been able to prove these charges in </p><p>court.  We will raise this issue with the Foreign, Justice, </p><p>and Interior ministries and report septel. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
