<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L BEIJING 15390 </p><p> </p><p>NIACT IMMEDIATE FOR CHINA WATCH </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR DOUG PAAL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, CH </p><p>SUBJECT:  SITREP NO. 28:  TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND </p><p>ARMED TROOPS STOPPED AT CITY PERIMETER BY HUMAN AND </p><p>BUS BARRRICADES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  BEIJING 15383 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND HELMETED, ARMED TROOPS </p><p>MOVED TOWARD BEIJING DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY </p><p>EVENING HOURS OF JUNE 3.  AS OF 1930, LARGE CONVOYS </p><p>HAVE BEEN STOPPED AS BEFORE BY BUS AND HUMAN </p><p>BARRICADES.  THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF TROOP </p><p>TRUCKS IS ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE CITY IN FRONT </p><p>OF THE NEW WORLD TRADE CENTER, ABOUT 5-6 KILOMETERS </p><p>FROM TIANANMEN SQUARE.  EMBOFFS SAW AT LEAST TWENTY </p><p>TRUCKS THERE, BUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED HAD BEEN </p><p>SEEN HEADING TOWARD THE CITY ON THAT ROUTE, SO WE </p><p>ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED PLUS TROOP </p><p>TRUCKS AT THAT LOCATION.  THE TROOPS ARE HELMETED </p><p>AND ARE CARRYING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.  MOST OF THEM </p><p>SEEM TO BE STAYING IN THEIR TRUCKS FOR THE TIME </p><p>BEING.  MORE THAN 35 TRUCKS FILLED WITH HELMETED, </p><p>ARMED TROOPS ARE STOPPED AT THE SECOND RING ROAD </p><p>OVERPASS, DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE JIANGUOMENWAI </p><p>DIPLOMATIC HOUSING COMPOUND.  THERE ARE REPORTEDLY </p><p>82 TRUCKS BLOCKED BY FOUR LARGE DUMP TRUCKS ALONG </p><p>THE ROAD TO CAPITAL AIRPORT.  WE ALSO HAVE REPORTS </p><p>OF TWENTY SIX TRUCKS STOPPED AND SURROUNDED BY CITY </p><p>RESIDENTS BETWEEN THE LIDO HOTEL AND THE GREAT WALL </p><p>HOTEL IN THE NORTHEASTERN SUBURBS.  THERE ARE ABOUT </p><p>TWO THOUSAND TROOPS JUST WEST OF THE GREAT HALL OF </p><p>THE PEOPLE IN A STANDOFF WITH CITY RESIDENTS WHICH </p><p>HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE EARLY AFTERNOON.  THE </p><p>POPULATION APPEARS HOSTILE TO PLA MOVEMENTS INTO THE </p><p>CITY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ELITE AIRBORNE TROOPS ARE MOVING FROM THE SOUTH </p><p>AND TANK UNITS HAVE BEEN ALERTED TO MOVE.  DAO </p><p>OFFICERS ARE OUT CHECKING THE WESTERN SUBURBS.  DAO </p><p>IS REPORTING FURTHER DETAILS TO WASHINGTON.  ALL </p><p>EMBASSY INFORMATION SO FAR SUGGESTS THAT THE UNITS </p><p>OTHER THAN THE AIRBORNE TROOPS ARE FROM THE 39TH </p><p>ARMY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  THE TROOPS HAVE OBVIOUSLY NOT YET BEEN GIVEN </p><p>ORDERS PERMITTING THEM TO USE FORCE.  THEIR LARGE </p><p>NUMBERS, THE FACT THAT THEY ARE HELMETED, AND THE </p><p>AUTOMATIC WEAPONS THEY ARE CARRYING SUGGEST THAT THE </p><p>FORCE OPTION IS REAL. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LILLEY </p><p></p></div>
