<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KHARTOUM 00185 </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/SPG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL:03/02/13; </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, SU, AL, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT:    SUDAN\'S POSITION ON IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: KHARTOUM 178 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION MARGUERITA RAGSDALE. </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAS FORMALLY </p><p>SPELLED OUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S VERY GENERALIZED AND </p><p>NON-CONFRONTATIONAL POSITION ON IRAQ WHICH PUTS KHARTOUM BEHIND </p><p>THE UNSC RESOLUTION AND THE WORK OF THE INSPECTORS.  THE </p><p>POSITION IS MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM VIEWS EXPRESSED BY SUDAN\'S </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER DAYS EARLIER AT THE ARAB LEAGUE MINISTERIAL </p><p>MEETING IN CAIRO. IN THE MEANTIME, PRESIDENT BASHIR DECLINED TO </p><p>ATTEND THE SHARM AL-SHEIKH SUMMIT IN ORDER TO ADDRESS PRESSING </p><p>ISSUES AT HOME.  LOCAL PUBLIC OPINION APPEARS TO AGREE WITH </p><p>BASHIR\'S CHOICE OF PRIORITIES. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE AMERICAS </p><p>DEPARTMENT AMBASSADOR MOHAMED AL-AMIN AL-KARIB CONVOKED DCM </p><p>03/01 TO CONVEY A PAPER OUTLINING SUDAN\'S POSITION ON THE ISSUE </p><p>OF IRAQ.  REFTEL NOTES THE CONCERTED EFFORT OF SUDAN\'S FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER DR. MUSTAPHA ISMAIL TO REPAIR DAMAGE CAUSED BY HIS </p><p>REMARKS AT THE ARAB LEAGUE MINISTERIAL IN CAIRO.  IN THOSE </p><p>COMMENTS, ISMAIL CAME OUT AGAINST ARAB STATES ALLOWING BASES AND </p><p>FACILITIES IN THEIR COUNTRIES TO BE USED IN AN ATTACK AGAINST </p><p>IRAQ.  THE MINISTER\'S SUBSEQUENT STATEMENTS INDICATED THAT HE </p><p>HAD BACKED AWAY FROM THAT POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF THE POSITION PAPER READ BY AL-KARIB </p><p>AND HANDED OVER TO DCM AS A NON-PAPER. IT STATES THAT SUDAN\'S </p><p>STANCE ON IRAQ IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING: </p><p> </p><p>A. FIRM COMMITMENT TO THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS </p><p>SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE NECESSITY OF FULL COOPERATION BETWEEN </p><p>IRAQ AND THE INSPECTORS, AS THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO AVOID WAR. </p><p> </p><p>B. WEAPONS INSPECTORS ARE THE CONCERNED BODY THAT WILL DECIDE </p><p>WHETHER IRAQ HAS FULLY COMPLIED WITH SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>RESOLUTIONS; </p><p> </p><p>C. IT IS THE HOPE OF SUDAN THAT ALL WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION </p><p>BE REMOVED FROM IRAQ WITHOUT WAR; </p><p> </p><p>D.  THIS SUDANESE POSITION WILL BE VOICED OUT IN ALL REGIONAL </p><p>FORUMS SUCH AS THE ARAB LEAGUE, NAM, AND OIC.  AS WELL, SUDAN </p><p>WILL ABIDE BY THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE REGIONAL FORUMS ON THE </p><p>ISSUE; </p><p> </p><p>E.  IF THERE IS ANY SPECIFIC VIEWPOINT FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>THE UNITED STATES ON THE ISSUE, THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT WILL BE </p><p>READY TO HEIR THAT VIEW. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR ASSIM TOLD CHARGE MILLINGTON THAT </p><p>SUDAN\'S FM REVERSED HIS POSITION ON IRAQ "BECAUSE SUDAN IS </p><p>IRRELEVANT AS FAR AS IRAQ IS CONCERNED" AND BECAUSE THE COUNTRY </p><p>RISKED LOSING CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT POTENTIAL FROM GULF STATES </p><p>SUCH AS KUWAIT, THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND SAUDI ARABIA. </p><p>THESE COUNTRIES HAD ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO INITIATE SERIOUS </p><p>INVESTMENT OPTIONS HERE SINCE THEIR BREAK WITH SUDAN FOLLOWING </p><p>THE 1991 GULF WAR. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) COMMENT:  SUDAN\'S PRESIDENT OMAR BASHIR DECLINED TO </p><p>PARTICIPATE IN THE ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT AT SHARM AL-SHEIKH, CITING </p><p>"INTERNAL ISSUES RELATED TO PEACE AND SECURITY IN SUDAN." </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER ISMAIL LED SUDAN\'S DELEGATION AND READ A </p><p>STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT BASHIR THAT DID NOT GO BEYOND THOSE </p><p>INNOCUOUS REMARKS QUOTED ABOVE.  PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN SUDAN </p><p>GENERALLY SUPPORTED BASHIR\'S DECISION NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE </p><p>ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT.  WHILE THERE IS WIDESPREAD PUBLIC OPPOSITION </p><p>TO A U.S.-LED ATTACK AGAINST IRAQ, MOST SUDANESE APPEAR TO AGREE </p><p>WITH BASHIR\'S POSITION THAT THERE ARE MORE PRESSING ISSUES THAT </p><p>NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AT HOME. END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MILLINGTON </p><p></p></div>
