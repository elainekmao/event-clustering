<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 004744 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/19/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAL, IS, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: MEETING WITH STEAMED FORMER PRIME MINISTER TAHIR </p><p>AL-MASRI </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) In a meeting with former Prime Minister Tahir al-Masri </p><p>on August 18, a visibly angry al-Masri complained about the </p><p>recent U.S. treatment of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and </p><p>encouraged the U.S.--before any movement against Iraq--to </p><p>pressure the Israelis to withdraw from Areas A and improve </p><p>the humanitarian situation on the ground for the </p><p>Palestinians.  We report al-Masri\'s comments as illustrative </p><p>of an emerging theme in Jordan -- that the U.S. is "targeting </p><p>a number of Arab countries with large populations or economic </p><p>importance," in the words of one editorial.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING YOUR ALLIES? </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Al-Masri started the meeting by asking Poloff why the </p><p>U.S. is attacking two of its closest allies--Egypt and Saudi </p><p>Arabia.  Al-Masri pointed to two recent issues that have made </p><p>the press here--the lawsuit launched against several Saudi </p><p>NGOs and members of the Royal family, and the U.S. decision </p><p>not to request supplemental funds for Egypt because of the </p><p>case of human rights activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim.  Al-Masri </p><p>refused to believe Poloff\'s explanation that the USG had no </p><p>control over the civil lawsuit launched by private Amcits, </p><p>saying that the USG could have done something for the Saudis. </p><p> As further evidence of hostile U.S. intentions towards Saudi </p><p>Arabia, he showed Poloff a Salon.com article which portrays </p><p>the administration as only slightly less antagonistic towards </p><p>Saudi Arabia than Iraq.  On the Saad Eddin Ibrahim issue, </p><p>al-Masri complained that the U.S. is putting both countries </p><p>in a terrible position vis a vis Iraq and the Palestinian </p><p>situation. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p>PALESTINE: PLEASE DO SOMETHING BEFORE YOU HIT IRAQ </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Al-Masri calmed down a bit to talk about the issue of </p><p>Iraq.  Al-Masri told Poloff he was convinced that the U.S. </p><p>intends to launch an attack--it was a question of when, not </p><p>if.  Al-Masri suggested that to temper the reaction in Jordan </p><p>to U.S. military action, the U.S. should pressure the </p><p>Israelis to withdraw from Area A and improve the humanitarian </p><p>situation on the ground in the West Bank (i.e. lift the </p><p>curfew).  Al-Masri predicted that by doing so, "it will be </p><p>much easier for the U.S. to go after Iraq." </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Al-Masri became riled again discussing the </p><p>deteriorating situation in the West Bank, particularly the </p><p>declining living conditions which were "taking a terrible </p><p>toll on everyone."  He reiterated his support for the </p><p>President\'s June 24 speech, but doubted Sharon\'s commitment </p><p>to the President\'s goal of a two-state solution and believed </p><p>Sharon was doing all he could to undermine the peace effort. </p><p>Since the speech, according to al-Masri, "the Palestinians </p><p>have done everything the U.S. has asked of them...but each </p><p>time Sharon says no."  Al-Masri commented that Palestinian </p><p>Jordanians were seething about recent Israeli actions in the </p><p>West Bank, but had no outlet to express their emotions. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Al-Masri, who is often acerbic but seldom emotional, </p><p>was striking a theme which we are hearing in the press and </p><p>from a variety of sources -- that the U.S. is "targeting" a </p><p>number of Arab countries, including allies like Egypt and </p><p>Saudi Arabia, as part of a strategy for the region.  In the </p><p>words of an editorial in "Dustour," "All this means...a </p><p>serious negative turning point in the course of Arab-American </p><p>relations, especially in the Arab countries that are </p><p>classified as allies of the United States...The only </p><p>beneficiary" is Israel, which supposedly is encouraging an </p><p>attack on Iraq and "instigating" the U.S. against Egypt and </p><p>Saudi Arabia.  To some degree, this perspective is simply a </p><p>variant on the widespread perception that the U.S. has a </p><p>fundamentally anti-Arab bias in policy.  To the extent, </p><p>however, that Jordanians come to believe that the U.S. is </p><p>dismissive even of its friends in the Arab world, American </p><p>credibility suffers across the board. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
