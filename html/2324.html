<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L VATICAN 006539 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE (MENNUTI); DRL/IRF (FARR) </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/18/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, CH, VT, TA </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH VATICAN CHINA EXPERT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR R.J. NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 </p><p>(A) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON CALLED ON ARCHBISHOP MARIA CELLI, </p><p>SECRETARY OF THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE PATRIMONY OF THE </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>APOSTOLIC SEE, ON DECEMBER 14.  ALTHOUGH CELLI, IN HIS </p><p>CURRENT POSITION AS CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR OF VATICAN PROPERTIES </p><p>DOES NOT HAVE A DIRECT FOREIGN POLICY ROLE, HE IS OFTEN </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        VATICA  06539  191519Z </p><p>CALLED UPON BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY TO ADVISE AND ASSIST ON </p><p>CHINA POLICY. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CELLI SAID THAT THE VATICAN ACCEPTS THAT THERE WILL BE </p><p>NO IMPROVEMENT IN CHINA/VATICAN RELATIONS UNTIL AT LEAST THE </p><p>COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS IN MARCH, 2002.  THE CURRENT </p><p>DIRECTOR OF THE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS BUREAU IN BEIJING IS AN </p><p>"OLD MAOIST".  ACCORDING TO CELLI, THE POWER OF THE RELIGIOUS </p><p>AFFAIRS BUREAU IS A MAJOR REASON THAT BEIJING REFUSES TO </p><p>BEGIN DISCUSSIONS ON NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.  CELLI </p><p>EXPLAINED THAT THE BUREAU IS A MAJOR BUREAUCRACY WHICH IS </p><p>FIGHTING HARD TO PROTECT ITS POWER, PERKS, AND PERSONNEL. THE </p><p>HEAD OF THE PATRIOTIC CATHOLIC CHURCH, THE BISHOP OF BEIJING, </p><p>IS COMPLACENT WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION AND HE TOO DEPENDS </p><p>ON THE BUREAU FOR HIS POWER AND POSITION. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) AMBASSADOR ASKED IF THE POPE\'S RECENT OVERTURE TO </p><p>BEIJING HAS HAD ANY EFFECT.  CELLI REPLIED THAT THE VATICAN </p><p>IS NOW ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOT.  HE WENT ON TO SAY </p><p>THAT CHINA IS A "BIRD CAGE" AND THAT THE VATICAN\'S GOAL IS </p><p>NOT TO BREAK DOWN THE "CAGE" BUT TO WIDEN IT.  THE VATICAN </p><p>DOES NOT EXPECT FULL FREEDOM OF RELIGION IN CHINA ANY TIME IN </p><p>THE NEAR FUTURE, AND IS THEREFORE WILLING TO ACCEPT A </p><p>"DECENT" LEVEL.  THE AMBASSADOR INQUIRED IF VATICAN RELATIONS </p><p>WITH TAIWAN IS AN OBSTACLE TO NORMALIZATION.  CELLI SAID THAT </p><p>BEIJING KNOWS "PERFECTLY WELL" THAT TAIWAN IS NOT AN ISSUE. </p><p>ACCORDING TO CELLI, BEJING USES THE TAIWAN ISSUE AS AN EXCUSE </p><p>TO PREVENT DISCUSSION ON THE REAL ISSUE-- THE RIGHT OF THE </p><p>CATHOLIC CHURCH TO NAME ITS OWN BISHOPS. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CELLI SAID THAT THE VATICAN KNOWS PRESIDENT BUSH MADE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        VATICA  06539  191519Z </p><p>AN INTERVENTION ON ITS BEHALF IN SHANGHAI, AND THAT IT IS </p><p>VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.  THIS TYPE OF HELP IS NEEDED AS THE </p><p>CATHOLIC COMMUNITY IN CHINA IS SUFFERING.  CELLI POINTED TO </p><p>THE FACT THAT WITHIN FIVE OR SIX YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF THE </p><p>ELDERLY BISHOPS WILL PROBABLY DIE.  AS THERE WAS A LONG </p><p>PERIOD IN WHICH THERE WERE NO ORDINATIONS OF PRIESTS AND </p><p>BISHOPS, THESE DYING BISHOPS WILL BE REPLACED BY VERY YOUNG, </p><p>INEXPERIENCED CHURCHMEN.  THUS, THE VATICAN\'S GOAL IS TO </p><p>NORMALIZE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH BEIJING BEFORE THIS OCCURS. </p><p>THIS WOULD ALLOW THE VATICAN TO GUIDE THE TRANSITION. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) AMBASSADOR ASKED CELLI FOR HIS VIEWS ON VIETNAM. </p><p>CELLI SAID THAT HE IS NO LONGER INVOLVED ON THE VIETNAM </p><p>ISSUE.  THAT SAID, HE BELIEVED THAT THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY </p><p>WAS SOMEWHAT IMPROVED THAN WHEN HE WAS LAST THERE FIVE YEARS </p><p>AGO.  AT THAT TIME, HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO VISIT ANY CATHOLIC </p><p>CHURCHES IN HANOI. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) COMMENT:  THE VATICAN IS RESIGNED TO THE FACT THAT THE </p><p>POPE\'S OVERTURE IN OCTOBER FELL ON DEAF EARS.  IT IS NOW </p><p>WAITING UNTIL AFTER MARCH TO RESUME ITS DIPLOMATIC PUSH.  IT </p><p>IS LIKELY FOR THE VATICAN TO MAKE SOME CONCESSIONS TO BEIJING </p><p>TO REESTABLISH ITSELF BEFORE THE END OF THIS DECADE. </p><p>NICHOLSON////////// </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> 2001VATICA06539 - Classification: CONFIDENTIAL </p><p></p><p></p></div>
