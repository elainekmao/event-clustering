<p>S E C R E T AMMAN 002467 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR DAUFHAUSER/BFOX/BMURDEN/JZARATE/PASHIN </p><p>NSC FOR JMYERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/23/2008 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ETTC, JO, IZ, UNSC </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZ01:TRACKING IRAQI ASSETS IN JORDAN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 98752 </p><p>     B. AMMAN 1914 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (s)  The GOJ has agreed to receive a small team of U.S. </p><p>Treasury experts.  Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb told the </p><p>Ambassador on April 23 that Central Bank Governor Umayya </p><p>Toukan would cooperate and work closely with the team to the </p><p>extent consistent with Jordanian law.  Abu Ragheb stressed </p><p>that the visit would have to be very discreet and that there </p><p>could be no publicity inside or outside of Jordan. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (s)  Adding that he had consulted with Toukan (ECON/C had </p><p>previously passed the contents of the request to Toukan), Abu </p><p>Ragheb said there were portions of our request that they </p><p>could certainly support.  He thought, however, that it might </p><p>not be possible to satisfy all of the expectations in reftel. </p><p> In particular, the types of action against Iraqi front </p><p>companies suggested in reftel might pose domestic legal </p><p>complications.  Interviews with non-GOJ officials might also </p><p>be difficult to arrange.  Nonetheless, Toukan and his </p><p>associates would be ready to discuss these issues with the </p><p>team. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (s)  The embassy is likewise ready to work with a </p><p>Treasury team.  Please advise on expected arrival dates via a </p><p>country clearance request.  This request should also provide </p><p>security level information for team members and fiscal data </p><p>to cover the team\'s expenses (e.g., transportation, mobile </p><p>phones).  We can provide temporary office space to accomodate </p><p>2-3 people in the economic section.  The Jordanian workweek </p><p>is Sunday-Thursday.  Please note that Sunday, April 27 is the </p><p>local Easter holiday during which Jordanian offices and the </p><p>embassy will be closed. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
