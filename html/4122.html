Not for Internet posting. </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary:  The heads of 8 large corporations in </p><p>Zimbabwe are banking that their new association can engage </p><p>the Government of Robert Mugabe in a non-threatening manner </p><p>and help the country stave off deeper recession. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Will Mugabe listen? </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU) In funding Business Initiative Zimbabwe (BIZ), the </p><p>company chiefs have declared that "we in the business </p><p>community cannot stand by while 90 percent of the population </p><p>sinks below the poverty datum line."  This is the business </p><p>community\'s most organized effort to build a dialogue with </p><p>the Mugabe government.  Founders hope to win the President\'s </p><p>trust by underwriting numerous projects that he approves of, </p><p>such as a young farmers program.  (Member corporations agree </p><p>to pledge .35 percent of revenue to assist small </p><p>entrepreneurs.)  Ultimately, they seek to leverage any good- </p><p>will into restored influence with the GoZ. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p>3. (SBU) Given the GoZ\'s distrust of the private sector and </p><p>entrenched statist mindset, this is a tough sell.  After a </p><p>recent two-day Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries </p><p>symposium where business leaders gently challenged </p><p>government ministers, the GoZ had the CZI head dismissed. </p><p>Furthermore, it does not help that some BIZ members </p><p>represent British multinationals.  However, the CEOs of </p><p>Standard Chartered and Anglo American, both prominent black </p><p>Zimbabweans, have told us they see little to gain through </p><p>confrontation.  BIZ founders, a collection of Zimbabwe\'s </p><p>most prominent movers-and-shakers, have tried unsuccessfully </p><p>for months to secure a meeting with Mugabe.  Meanwhile, they </p><p>hope to recruit Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa as an </p><p>honorary board member.  BIZ already includes several </p><p>Zimbabwe-owned companies, such as PG, and members want to </p><p>add a couple dozen more.  Standard Chartered CEO Washington </p><p>Masaira, the first BIZ chairman, told us the organization </p><p>will strive to be assertive but unthreatening - a very fine </p><p>line coming from reps of Western corporate interests in </p><p>today\'s Zimbabwe.  Masaira is not confident he will succeed, </p><p>but believes this may be the business community\'s last </p><p>chance to help salvage what\'s left of Zimbabwe\'s economy. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
