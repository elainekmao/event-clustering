<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001273 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR INR/MR, I/RW, I/REC; PA </p><p>SA/INS (CAMP, WALLER), SA/PD (SCHWARTZ, BRENNIG, SCENSNY), </p><p>SSA/PAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OPRC, KMDR, OIIP, CE </p><p>SUBJECT:  Media Play:  "Mystery American" attends Sri </p><p>Lankan intelligence meetings? </p><p> </p><p>1. On Sunday, 7/14, readers of the SUNDAY TIMES </p><p>(independent English weekender), one of Sri Lanka\'s mass </p><p>circulation newspapers, woke up to front-page, above-the- </p><p>fold headlines:  "Mystery American at government </p><p>intelligence meetings."  The gist of the allegation:  an </p><p>AmCit had participated in meetings of the GSL\'s </p><p>intelligence community.  "This ... poses threats to their </p><p>own sources of intelligence," a "highly agitated source" </p><p>said, and "raises very serious questions over national </p><p>security...."  The story played throughout the week and </p><p>into the following weekend.  By 7/20 the AmCit had become a </p><p>CIA agent named Bruce Hoffman, and had been joined by one </p><p>or more colleagues from India and the UK.  President </p><p>Kumaratunga, furious at the discovery, had instructed </p><p>senior officials to close intelligence meetings to </p><p>foreigners.  Senior officials, in turn, had admitted the </p><p>presence of the AmCit but had insisted that his presence </p><p>was important to the "restructuring of the intelligence </p><p>unit."  Kumaratunga\'s Peoples Alliance (PA) maintained that </p><p>his presence was evidence of "increasing interference" by </p><p>the USG as well as a "threat to the security of the </p><p>President and our neighbor India."  Finally, weekend </p><p>reports had the PM\'s United National Party (UNP) declaring </p><p>it "normal practice to obtain the services of foreign </p><p>experts," but saying that the Prime Minister would send the </p><p>foreigners home "if local intelligence officers think that </p><p>foreign expertise is unnecessary."  Meanwhile, other </p><p>headlines had the foreigners leaving on their own volition, </p><p>saying that they would "refuse to get involved in further </p><p>activities," while at least one Sinhala daily reported that </p><p>the visit had fallen prey to an LTTE plot to curtail the </p><p>consultations. </p><p> </p><p>2. Comment.  As often happens in Sri Lankan politics, the </p><p>"mysterious American" quickly became a cohabitation </p><p>football, with the President\'s PA alliance "strongly </p><p>oppos[ing] the presence of outsiders at such important </p><p>meetings" and the PM\'s UNP insisting that "training of </p><p>intelligence personnel by foreign experts has been carried </p><p>out for a long time, even during the time of the PA </p><p>government."  He also became fodder for Sri Lanka\'s pro- </p><p>LTTE interests, most vehemently in the pro-LTTE Tamil </p><p>daily, SUDAR OLI, which called him "clear proof that </p><p>Premier Ranil\'s government is being caught in the American </p><p>net, little by little" and argued that the government, </p><p>while engaged in peace talks for a permanent solution, is </p><p>preparing to suppress the liberation war of the Tamils </p><p>militarily by strengthening its forces.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>3.

Commentary. </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>5. On 7/18, under the headline "American invasion of </p><p>intelligence services," the pro-LTTE SUDAR OLI (independent </p><p>Tamil daily) called the alleged incident "clear proof" of </p><p>U.S. meddling and the insincerity of the GSL as a peace </p><p>partner: </p><p> </p><p>"This is a clear proof that Premier Ranil\'s government is </p><p>being caught in the American net, little by little. </p><p> </p><p>"The Government, while engaged in peace talks for a </p><p>permanent solution, is preparing to suppress the liberation </p><p>war of the Tamils militarily by strengthening its forces. </p><p> </p><p>"As a step in the implementation of this plan, the </p><p>government is seeking the fullest support of the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>"Bringing American officers into the intelligence services </p><p>is a part of the government\'s plan to obtain U.S. support </p><p>for joint military exercises, sea operations, and weaponry. </p><p> </p><p>"This attempt of the government to pawn the country to a </p><p>superpower will lead to further complications, from which </p><p>the country will not be able to escape. </p><p> </p><p>"National forces should rise against such government </p><p>actions. Will these forces wake up?" </p><p> </p><p>6. On 7/20 the SUNDAY ISLAND (independent English </p><p>weekender), whose ruling editorial assumption is that the </p><p>GSL is being hoodwinked by the LTTE, said under the </p><p>headlines "spectres of indifference," that it found </p><p>"utterly incomprehensible the inability or unwillingness of </p><p>... officials to protest an act which violates the </p><p>constitution of Sri Lanka and endangers her national </p><p>security.  The total silence of the Minister of Defence ... </p><p>is hardly surprising since he has proven beyond reasonable </p><p>doubt that his job is not to defend the national interests </p><p>of the state of Sri Lanka.  However what about the </p><p>President, the SLFP and those patriots par excellence, the </p><p>JVP?  How come they are yet to say a word about this </p><p>incident?" </p><p> </p><p>7. In contrast, the SUNDAY OBSERVER (government-owned </p><p>English weekender) took a more sardonic tone.  In its </p><p>regular "Periscope" column it wondered:  "Where else can an </p><p>aspiring 007 learn his ropes than at the feet of our </p><p>masters!  What a privilege he had accorded to our </p><p>intelligence gurus.  We should have more disciples like </p><p>this to strengthen our team.  Viva! big brothers and \'big\' </p><p>sisters."  However, "Periscope" also made mention of "U.S. </p><p>intelligence success at disrupting the [LTTE\'s] Cambodian </p><p>operation" of arms smuggling, which, "Periscope" said, was </p><p>"another \'thorn\' in the side [which] further reduces the </p><p>efficacy of their \'weapons transfer system.\'" </p><p> </p><p>ENTWISTLE </p><p></p></div>
