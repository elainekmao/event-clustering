Speaking at `Forum Istanbul 2003\', Perle stressed </p><p>that Turkey missed big opportunities in Iraq and the </p><p>relations between Turkey and the US was damaged but </p><p>continues.  Mending Turco-American bilateral ties depended </p><p>on Turkey\'s cooperation on Syria and Iran policy.  "Zaman" </p><p>reports that US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher </p><p>in turn stressed that Richard Perle is a private citizen and </p><p>he does not speak for the U.S. Government.  "Zaman" also </p><p>reports (inaccurately - Ed.)US Ambassador Robert Pearson </p><p>saying that `the ties between Turkey and the US would not be </p><p>the same anymore after the crisis faced during the Iraq war. </p><p>The article further alleges that the Ambassador said that </p><p>Turkey had disappointed the US with its stance during the </p><p>war and that relations between the two countries needed </p><p>mending.\'  "Hurriyet" and "Milliyet" report that President </p><p>Bush, in order to ease the tension between the two </p><p>countries, gave a guarantee to President Sezer on Iraq\'s </p><p>integrity, during his condolence call after the Bingol </p><p>earthquake. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PKK: "Sabah" reports that Turkey and the US decide to take </p><p>new steps against the PKK.  While US issues a call to </p><p>surrender to PKK militants, Turkey, as it was discussed at </p><p>the last NSC meeting, debates on a "repentance plan" </p><p>(limited amnesty) for PKK militants.  "Hurriyet" columnist </p><p>Sedat Ergin writes that `The PKK-KADEK is in the US\' </p><p>terrorist organizations list, among others.  He adds that if </p><p>Turkey had not rejected the motion for cooperation with the </p><p>US, Turkish army would be given the right to fight against </p><p>PKK in Northern Iraq.  The refusal of the motion left the </p><p>control of 5.000 PKK-KADEK militants to fellow Kurds, </p><p>Barzani and Talabani.  It is clear that Turkey has not given </p><p>any intelligence reports to the US about the PKK and the </p><p>Turkish side complains that so far US had given Ankara no </p><p>details about its plan on this issue.  The US might issue a </p><p>call for surrender to the militants, and Turkey might pass </p><p>the repentance law.  In this case PKK militants will have to </p><p>choose between taking advantage of the repentance law and </p><p>incurring US reactions. The PKK-KADEK issue will become a </p><p>new test for Turco-American relations.  Mass appeal </p><p>Milliyet\'s Fikret Bila noted the intention as well as the </p><p>efforts for alternate solutions to the PKK/KADEK issue, in </p><p>Turkey\'s military and civilian authority.  One of the ideas </p><p>is to announce a `repentance law\' to have the PKK militants </p><p>to put down their arms and give in. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>AWACS: All papers report that Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul </p><p>denied the press reports that Turkey had bought AWACS just </p><p>to please US.  He said that the government had decided to </p><p>approve the purchase because the General Staff had indicated </p><p>that it needed the AWACS systems. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IMF:  "Radikal" covers the meetings with IMF deputy director </p><p>Ann Krueger and the Turkish government officials.  Krueger </p><p>warned the officials on two issues; the money collected in a </p><p>recent tax amnesty campaign has to be used for debt </p><p>repayments and Turkey should avoid the changes in the public </p><p>tender law.  Krueger warned the government against the </p><p>bureaucratic reshuffle and added that the government should </p><p>carry out reforms in social security. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus:  All papers and TV channels cover Prime Minister </p><p>Erdogan\'s visit to Cyprus today.  He is expected to </p><p>undertake new moves on the Cyprus issue.  "Zaman" describes </p><p>the visit as "critical" and NTV reports that Erdogan\'s visit </p><p>can trigger the tensions with TRNC President Denktas by </p><p>issuing a message for resuming Cyprus talks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  US-Turkey </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wolfowitz pushed the heads out of the sand" </p><p>Mass appeal daily Hurriyet\'s Fatih Altayli notes that </p><p>Wolfowitz was forced to be blunt on Turkey (5/9): "Both the </p><p>Wolfowitz and Grossman remarks came as no surprise.  These </p><p>views reflect the press commentaries in the near past </p><p>because, from the very beginning, Americans did not conceal </p><p>their thoughts.  The comments were  necessary for putting </p><p>the bilateral relations back into track.  Yet the Turkish </p><p>side deliberately ignored or avoided the facts.  Foreign </p><p>Minister Gul, for instance, did nothing but repeat the same </p><p>line as `our relations with the US are going well.\'  When </p><p>pressed, he acknowledged the differences about Turkey within </p><p>Pentagon and State Department, but he ended his statement </p><p>with an optimistic tone.  Now Wolfowitz is applying `shock </p><p>therapy\' in order to stop the never-ending `putting heads in </p><p>the sand\' policy." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The way to repair the damage" </p><p>Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (5/9): "Both sides </p><p>have made mistakes in the course of the Iraq war.  And it </p><p>should be for the experts and concerned officials to work on </p><p>the mistakes and make sure they will not happen again.  Yet </p><p>in the meantime, both sides should refrain from making </p><p>provocative remarks and sending messages via the media.  If </p><p>this happens to be the case, then the damage will be easier </p><p>to repair. . The way out of the crisis is to take lessons </p><p>from the past and move on together. . There are some areas, </p><p>which make the cooperation easy, such as Iraq\'s economic </p><p>restructuring.  Yet there are some other areas, which seem </p><p>to be tough on reaching consensus, such as policies on Syria </p><p>and Iran.  The best way is, regardless of tough or easy </p><p>issues, to ensure a good way of communication.  And it is </p><p>better to discuss projects rather than focusing on polemical </p><p>rhetoric." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Turkey has to decide" </p><p>Erdal Guven argued in liberal-intellectual Radikal (5/9): </p><p>"There is no need to fool ourselves.  Turkey has never been </p><p>a strategic partner of the US in genuine terms.  The US has </p><p>two strategic partners, UK and Israel, and that\'s all. . </p><p>This does not necessarily mean that the US cannot engage in </p><p>strategic cooperation or cannot form strategic alliances </p><p>with the others, including Turkey.  A strategic alliance </p><p>with Turkey is regional and multi-faceted.  But the Iraq </p><p>issue caused mistrust, and the bilateral relations are going </p><p>through a trust test right now. . Actually Wolfowitz is </p><p>clearly telling us that `you have made a mistake but it can </p><p>be made up.\'  Thus the decision is to us." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
