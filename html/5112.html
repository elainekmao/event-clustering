<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 000127 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/14/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PTER, PREL, KJUS, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM, TERFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: YEMEN GENERAL AND ISLAH PARTY REACTION TO ARRESTS </p><p>IN GERMANY;  GERMAN VIEWS </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 7011 </p><p>     B. BERLIN 131 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> 1.  (S)  Summary:  The arrest of al-Moayed in Frankfurt has </p><p>surprised many in Yemen, and public reaction is extremely </p><p>negative.  He is a well-known humanitarian to Yemenis, and </p><p>many have expressed shock about a possible connection to </p><p>al-Qaeda.  The Islah party is particularly concerned, and </p><p>similarly rejects the possibility that al-Moayed has an </p><p>al-Qaeda connection.  Negative public reaction to the </p><p>arrests, possibly including demonstrations, is likely.  The </p><p>Yemeni government continues to low key the issue and press </p><p>the FRG for repatriation.  Embassy is assessing security </p><p>implications.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Negative Popular Reaction </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S)  Moayed is a Islah party Shura Council member and </p><p>formerly a probable candidate for the parliamentary elections </p><p>in April.  Media reports (confirmed by PolFSN) noted that a </p><p>petition with 1000 signatures calling for his release was </p><p>circulated in Moayed\'s neighborhood in Sanaa, where he is </p><p>regarded as a humanitarian who is against terrorism. The </p><p>media has reported that the Islah party plans to provide </p><p>lawyers to those arrested.  Prominent Yemeni interlocutors </p><p>confirmed to the DCM that Moayed is a noted humanitarian, </p><p>active in aiding the poor in general -- particularly via the </p><p>provision of free food to thousands of low-income Sanaa </p><p>residents.  Embassy contacts also recall that he was "the </p><p>leading recruiter in Sanaa" for volunteers to fight the </p><p>Soviets in Afghanistan.  One (pro-U.S.) Yemeni NGO official </p><p>described Moayed as "a big mouth" who sometimes rants about </p><p>U.S. policy.  Nevertheless, a range of contacts agree that </p><p>his sermons also oppose anti-Western terrorism, and uniformly </p><p>view him as an extremely unlikely candidate for al-Qaeda </p><p>terrorist affiliation. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>Islah Approach </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S)  Urgent requests for a meeting with PolOff were made </p><p>by members of the Islah, and PolOff met with Islah Political </p><p>Director Mohamed Qahtan on January 12.  Qahtan, a well-known </p><p>moderate, said that he is convinced that al Moayed could have </p><p>nothing to do with al-Qaeda, and noted that in his last </p><p>mosque speech he condemned terrorism strongly with specific </p><p>references to the incidents in Jibla and against Jarallah </p><p>Omar.  He also described al Moayed\'s humanitarian work on </p><p>behalf of the poor, and expressed concern about his health </p><p>while in custody.  Qahtan said that while he would not be </p><p>shocked by some people being definitively linked with </p><p>al-Qaeda, the alleged links between Moayed and al-Qaeda were </p><p>unbelievable as he was not an extremist personality.  Qahtan </p><p>asked for evidence of such links, and said that if such </p><p>evidence were provided his party would support the arrest </p><p>because Islah is totally against al-Qaeda.  (Comment:  Not </p><p>true, especially Islah\'s Zindani wing.  End Comment)  Qahtan </p><p>said that Islah feels strongly enough to offer to take </p><p>responsibility for al Moayed and provide guarantees unless </p><p>clear evidence emerged to prove links to al-Qaeda. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  PolOff said that the two arrested were being held in </p><p>Germany pending a court hearing, and that details about the </p><p>criminal case would become public as the legal process </p><p>continued.  PolOff noted that there was evidence linking al </p><p>Moayed to al-Qaeda financing.  Qahtan asked about whether al </p><p>Moayed\'s fundraising for Hamas via al-Aqsa would also be part </p><p>of the court case, noting that while "everyone was against </p><p>al-Qaeda, support for Palestinians is another matter." </p><p>PolOff emphasized a focus on links to al-Qaeda and allowing </p><p>due process to take its course.  PolOff said that these </p><p>arrests should not become a political issue between Islah and </p><p>the U.S., and restraint in politicizing the arrests within </p><p>Yemen would be prudent to avoid inflaming the situation. </p><p>Qahtan agreed to advise restraint and said he hoped that the </p><p>dialogue on this issue will continue. </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>German Assessment </p><p>----------------- </p><p>5.  (S)  German Ambassador to Yemen Werner Zimprich told </p><p>Ambassador Hull January 14 that he has received several </p><p>"grass roots" appeals from Yemeni beneficiaries of </p><p>al-Moayed\'s charity to return him to Yemen.  ROYG Interior </p><p>Minister Alimi, who enjoys significant credibility, also </p><p>argued strongly, in support of Yemen\'s case, with Ambassador </p><p>Zimprich that al-Moayed has no links to terrorism.  The </p><p>German Ambassador is re-assessing security for German </p><p>citizens, including many development assistance workers.  As </p><p>yet, he has not decided on a formal drawdown, but some </p><p>Embassy employees have been encouraged to extend leaves </p><p>outside Yemen. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S)  Comment:  Several contacts have told Post they </p><p>expect an active negative public reaction, including possible </p><p>demonstrations.  The course of the German extradition process </p><p>and subsequent U.S. prosecution will be followed closely by </p><p>many Yemenis and will influence the shape of popular reaction </p><p>in Yemen.  Embassy will assess security ramifications for </p><p>Amcits at an EAC January 14.  As we proceed with extradition, </p><p>U.S. public diplomacy should stress fair legal processes, </p><p>al-Qaeda links and appropriate humanitarian treatment, e.g. </p><p>medical care for any health problems.  End Comment. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
