<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000779 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, DRL </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/21/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: FUEL PRICE INCREASE TRIGGERS ZCTU CALL FOR MASS </p><p>ACTION </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. A) HARARE 752 </p><p> </p><p>     B. B) HARARE 550 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Laboff KRBel for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  After the GOZ unilaterally authorized a 300% </p><p>increase in gasoline prices outside the Tripartite </p><p>Negotiating Forum (TNF) framework (ref a), the Zimbabwe </p><p>Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has retaliated by calling for </p><p>a three-day mass stayaway and announcing its immediate </p><p>withdrawal from the TNF process (ref b).  Despite ZCTU claims </p><p>that it is coordinating efforts with other segments of civil </p><p>society, the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change </p><p>(MDC) reports that it is not playing an active role.  Initial </p><p>assessments indicate that the level of traffic around town is </p><p>extremely low, with very few commuter omnibuses plying the </p><p>usual routes; banks are closed throughout Harare, and up to </p><p>90% of Harare businesses are closes in industrial zones. </p><p>Ironically, the GOZ\'s incremental efforts to inch the economy </p><p>toward a sustainable position are likely to push labor more </p><p>firmly into open cooperation with the opposition.  End </p><p>summary. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>Labor\'s Response to Fuel Increases </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>2. (SBU)  The ZCTU called a General Council meeting on April </p><p>16 to consider its reactions to the hefty increase in fuel </p><p>prices, which still remain heavily subsidized.  Some transit </p><p>operators responded to the price increase by increasing the </p><p>fare for a one-way trip into Harare to Zim $500 (US $.37), </p><p>despite GOZ regulations fixing the price at around Zim $200. </p><p>Even though the fuel price increase is one of the few </p><p>positive economic moves initiated by the GOZ, the economic </p><p>reality -- wherein many workers earn around $25,000 per </p><p>month, yet transport costs now total $5,000 per week -- is </p><p>unsustainable for the majority.  The ZCTU General Council </p><p>demanded that the GOZ immediately rescind the price increase, </p><p>failing which they would call for unspecified action. </p><p>Predictably, the GOZ ignored the call, and ZCTU called for a </p><p>three-day stayaway beginning April 23. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Initial assessments indicate that many are heeding </p><p>the call.  Street traffic is considerably lower volume, and </p><p>the level of people on the streets is similar to that during </p><p>the March MDC stayaway.  Most banks are closed throughout </p><p>Harare, although some shops and grocery stores are still </p><p>open.  Between 70% and 90% of businesses are shut down in </p><p>Harare\'s industrial zones.  The majority of businesses still </p><p>open seem to be informal traders and smaller, owner-operator </p><p>type businesses, with the exception of three or four notable </p><p>giants -- including Coca-Cola, Chibuku Breweries, and several </p><p>export-oriented businesses.  If the most recent stayaway is </p><p>any indication, participation could build over the next two </p><p>days to the point that all businesses are brought to a </p><p>virtual standstill. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Contacts within labor report that the ZCTU is </p><p>coordinating this stayaway with other groups within civil </p><p>society.  Although some labor leaders would rather have </p><p>waited a few weeks to call for mass action, others -- whose </p><p>constituents demanded immediate action to address the </p><p>worsening transport crisis, as well as the GOZ\'s perceived </p><p>perfidy in raising prices unilaterally -- carried the day. </p><p>Labor leaders now hope to initiate protest action which can </p><p>be continued, in turn, by other groups opposed to the Zanu-PF </p><p>leadership during the following weeks.  Labor leaders have no </p><p>illusions about the GOZ\'s likely response to this call, and </p><p>are prepared to be arrested.  Several leaders reportedly </p><p>joked, with gallows humor, that given the notorious prison </p><p>conditions under which opposition leaders are commonly held, </p><p>they deliberately wore suits (for the added warmth from the </p><p>suit coats) to work.  Their main request, voiced through the </p><p>Solidarity Center rep, is that the international community </p><p>continue to focus attention on their plight should the </p><p>expected brutal retaliation materialize. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>MDC Supportive, But Not Involved In Organizing </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>5.(C) The MDC has publicly offered moral support to ZCTU for </p><p>the stayaway, and according to Gandi Mudzingwa, MDC special </p><p>assistant to the President, the MDC has also offered the </p><p>assistance of its structures to help mobilize people.  The </p><p>ZCTU has, however, not requested any assistance.  Mudzingwa\'s </p><p>thought was that with the lead time ZCTU has given itself, </p><p>they have not done sufficient organizing to ensure the </p><p>success of this stayaway; leaflets have not been printed, </p><p>other potential partner organizations have not been roped in </p><p>firmly.  If it succeeds, it will be due to people\'s </p><p>frustration rather than ZCTU planning.  Also, if it succeeds </p><p>it will help gel momentum for the MDC\'s own mass action </p><p>planned for about May 13, and perhaps open a key second front </p><p>in the fight against ZANU-PF.  If it fails, it will not hurt </p><p>the MDC\'s plans because there is widespread belief that </p><p>regime change will not occur through a stayaway alone, but </p><p>rather through more direct public action.  (Note: The MDC </p><p>originally planned for their next mass action to start on May </p><p>6, but Mudzingwa said on April 22 that another week was </p><p>likely going to be necessary to organize.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p>6. (C)  This development tallies with previous indications </p><p>that the ZCTU was "going through the motions" with the TNF </p><p>until the GOZ committed some error so gross that the labor </p><p>constituency (up to one-third of which comprises Zanu-PF </p><p>supporters) demanded mass action.  Although the TNF process </p><p>has dragged laboriously on, a signed agreement endorsing the </p><p>basic goals of the process -- increasing the minimum wage, </p><p>establishing a price control board to review price increases </p><p>in relation to inputs, and committing the GOZ to various </p><p>measurable goals such as reducing inflation -- never quite </p><p>materialized.  Ironically, the GOZ is countering the ZCTU </p><p>call for action with a front-page Herald article claiming </p><p>that the ZCTU actually "played a full part in the (TNF) talks </p><p>that resulted in the new fuel prices..."  This claim is </p><p>disingenuous at best, considering that no TNF agreement has </p><p>been finalized and no price control board has yet been </p><p>established.  The conundrum is that the reduction of the fuel </p><p>subsidy and subsequent price increase, in itself, is the type </p><p>of economic tough-love necessary to get the country back on a </p><p>realistic and stable footing.  The two mutually exclusive </p><p>goals -- labor\'s attempts to shield workers from their own </p><p>poverty, and the GOZ\'s attempts to inch the country toward </p><p>economic viability -- seem destined to push labor into the </p><p>camp of those alienated by the GOZ\'s economic and political </p><p>mismanagement. </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Comment continued: Although ZCTU contacts have said </p><p>this action is being coordinated with other civil society </p><p>groups, it appears the MDC has not been asked to play a </p><p>participatory role.  Even if the level of groundwork the ZCTU </p><p>has done is unclear, many people are away from work this week </p><p>due to the Easter holiday, and building frustration with fuel </p><p>and other shortages could combine to make a successful work </p><p>stoppage.  If some level of good participation is achieved, </p><p>we would expect the GOZ to react with a heavy hand toward </p><p>anyone perceived to be involved in planning this effort and </p><p>will monitor closely who takes the heat, and any effect this </p><p>stayaway has on the MDC\'s plans.  The Embassy\'s liberal leave </p><p>policy will be in effect for the relevant days.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
