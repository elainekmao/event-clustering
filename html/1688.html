On May 7, EconOff spoke with Mr. Stephen Oshungboye, </p><p>Director of Foreign Operations at the Central Bank of </p><p>Nigeria, who said he had no records regarding the MPRI </p><p>payment.  EconOff faxed Oshungboye copies of the April 18 </p><p>letter from the Minister of Defense to the CBN requesting </p><p>electronic transfer of USD 3.2 million.  Post obtained a copy </p><p>of the letter from the Minister of State for Army\'s office </p><p>shortly after it was sent.  (COMMENT: The letter from the </p><p>Minister of Defense was originally directed to Oshungboye. </p><p>END COMMENT.)  According to materials supplied Post by the </p><p>Ministry of Defense, the remainder (approximately USD </p><p>300,000) of the USD 3.5 million is pending foreign exchange </p><p>approval from the Ministry of Finance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  On May 8, Oshungboye informed EconOff that the check, </p><p>which had accompanied the April 18 letter, had not been </p><p>endorsed properly by the Ministry of Defense and had been </p><p>returned to the Ministry for correction.  When asked how </p><p>quickly the payment could be transferred once the corrected </p><p>check is received, Oshungboye said that could take 24 to 48 </p><p>hours.  Subsequently, EconOff called Lawal Balarabe, Special </p><p>Assistant to the Minister of State for the Army, who promised </p><p>to expedite correction of the check that same day (May 8). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Post will inform Department once the GON advises that the </p><p>transfer has been effected. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
