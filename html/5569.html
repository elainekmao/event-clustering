(C) Summary:  The Turkish Petroleum Agency (TPAO) is </p><p>optimistic about business opportunities in a post-sanctions </p><p>Iraq.  TPAO Vice President Bakiler believes TPAO will be </p><p>well-placed to sign exploration and production agreements </p><p>that the company has been negotiating for years with Iraq, </p><p>and to finalize the 1997 "Agreement on Iraq Natural Gas </p><p>Exports to Turkey."  TPAO has no current business activity in </p><p>Iraq, other than three rigs and 15 employees still in-country </p><p>after recently completing a drilling contract.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Turkish Petroleum Agency (TPAO) Vice President Can </p><p>Bakiler told econoff February 4 that TPAO is optimistic about </p><p>business opportunities in a post-sanctions Iraq.  Bakiler </p><p>said that, after U.N. sanctions were lifted, TPAO should be </p><p>in a good position in three particular areas:  exploration, </p><p>production, and realization of the Iraq-Turkey Natural Gas </p><p>Project (reftel).  On exploration, Bakiler said, TPAO had </p><p>been in discussions with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil since 1994 </p><p>to form a joint venture for hydrocarbon exploration in Iraq. </p><p>Although they had never finalized a contract, the basis of an </p><p>agreement existed.  Bakiler opined that, once sanctions were </p><p>lifted, TPAO should be well-placed to begin exploration </p><p>activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Bakiler reported that TPAO had also negotiated with </p><p>the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for years on development of the </p><p>Gharraf Oil Field.  Again, a contract had never been signed, </p><p>but the groundwork for an agreement had been completed. </p><p>Bakiler noted that the 1997 "Agreement on Iraq Natural Gas </p><p>Exports to Turkey" called for the development of five Iraqi </p><p>gas fields for the purpose of export to Turkey (reftel). </p><p>Bakiler said TPAO hoped to move forward with Iraq on the gas </p><p>deal, as well as the exploration and production agreements, </p><p>immediately after sanctions were lifted. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Commenting on TPAO\'s current activities in Iraq, </p><p>Bakiler stated that the international subsidiary of the </p><p>company, TPIC, had recently completed a U.N.-approved turnkey </p><p>contract to drill 20 wells in northern Iraq, in the region </p><p>between Kirkuk and Mosul.  Most of the 45 TPAO employees </p><p>working on this contract had left Iraq, with only about 15 </p><p>personnel remaining.  (Note:  Bakiler noted that only retired </p><p>TPAO employees working on contract were sent to Iraq.)  In </p><p>addition, three of TPAO\'s oil rigs still remained in Iraq, </p><p>near the site where the drilling work was done.  Bakiler </p><p>claimed that TPAO had not yet decided whether to evacuate its </p><p>personnel or the rigs.  The rigs were about 25 years old, and </p><p>therefore only worth about USD 1-2 million each; therefore, </p><p>they likely would remain in Iraq.  Bakiler asked econoff if </p><p>the U.S. could confirm whether oil rigs in the region between </p><p>Kirkuk and Mosul had a high risk of being destroyed in the </p><p>case of a military operation. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
