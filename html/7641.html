<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001066 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>HARARE FOR BRUCE WHARTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, PREL, PGOV, SNAR, GT, CU </p><p>SUBJECT: CUBA VOTE PROVOKES LARGELY POSITIVE REACTIONS IN </p><p>GUATEMALA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Summary: Unlike previous years, Guatemala\'s vote in </p><p>favor of the 2003 Cuba resolution at the UN Human Rights </p><p>Commission drew favorable editorials in the press.  Cuba\'s </p><p>repression of dissidents and the execution of the three </p><p>hijackers led to a steady stream of press criticism of </p><p>Castro\'s regime in the lead up to the vote. The only public </p><p>criticism of the GOG vote came from some human rights leaders </p><p>who oppose US policy in Cuba, and are prepared to be more </p><p>tolerant of the situation of human rights on the island. End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Leading daily Prensa Libre carried two editorials </p><p>April 21, entitled "Guatemala Sided with the Good Guys in </p><p>Geneva," and "The Pathetic Case of Fidel Castro," which </p><p>praised the GOG\'s decision to take a stand against recent </p><p>human rights violations in Cuba.  With reference to the </p><p>recent crackdown, the latter editorial stated, "In these </p><p>circumstances, to remain quiet in the face of unfair </p><p>practices is to become an accomplice to an old man who has </p><p>lost his mind...and leaves the door open for chaos in Cuba </p><p>when he dies."  The press, which is largely anti-government, </p><p>accused the Portillo government of being spineless in the </p><p>days before the UNCHR vote, when insinuations that the GOG </p><p>was going to abstain in Geneva were appearing on the same </p><p>pages as reports of new egregious actions by the Cubans to </p><p>repress dissent.  The press, which in previous years had </p><p>editorialized against the GOG\'s vote in favor of the Cuba </p><p>resolution as a sell-out to the USG, called on the GOG to </p><p>vote for the resolution this year and then praised the GOG </p><p>for voting in a principled manner.  We attribute part of this </p><p>change to the press\' favorable analysis of the USG\'s </p><p>criticism of GOG corruption and abuses in the last year. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) At the Ambassador\'s request, Human Rights Officer </p><p>engaged leaders of the human rights community in the weeks </p><p>previous to the vote to seek public support for imprisoned </p><p>Cuban dissidents.  Some said they would "ask the Cuban </p><p>Embassy privately for an explanation of the recent crackdown </p><p>against dissidents," but none engaged the press before the </p><p>vote.  After the vote, in an op-ed in daily El Periodico, </p><p>human rights activist Miguel Angel Albizures wrote that, </p><p>while the role of the USG in determining international policy </p><p>towards Cuba is condemnable, that is no excuse for the Castro </p><p>regime\'s brutal crackdown against dissidents.  Other human </p><p>rights leaders openly opposed the vote, however.  In Siglo </p><p>Veintiuno, Orlando Blanco, director of CONADEHGUA, a leading </p><p>human rights NGO, said, "it is important to guard the rights </p><p>of the Cubans.  Guatemala caved in to American pressures in </p><p>order to help with recertification efforts." </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) COMMENT: While the GOG had argued that voting in </p><p>favor of the Cuba resolution at the UNCHR would have a </p><p>political cost, in fact public opinion as measured in the </p><p>press was clearly shocked by Castro\'s recent human rights </p><p>crackdown and called on the GOG to punish Castro with its </p><p>vote.  With the exception of a couple of human rights leaders </p><p>who have long opposed our policies in Cuba, Guatemalans have </p><p>reacted positively to their government\'s principled vote in </p><p>Geneva. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
