<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L HARARE 002782 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PREL, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATIONS INCREASE - NOT CRITICAL MASS YET </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (U) On November 30 the National Constitutional Assembly </p><p>(NCA) staged demonstrations in five cities to pressure the </p><p>GOZ for a more democratic constitution.  Police arrested NCA </p><p>staff members and demonstrators, seized demonstration </p><p>materials and denied permission for the march in a sixth </p><p>city.  A well-respected political analyst said these </p><p>bi-weekly demonstrations are unlikely to be effective unless </p><p>they are coordinated with other civic organizations and </p><p>initiatives, and we would agree.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On November 30 the National Constitutional Assembly </p><p>(NCA), an umbrella organization of 104 civic organizations </p><p>comprising members from all over the country working for </p><p>constitutional reform, staged 3-hour demonstration marches in </p><p>Harare, Bulawayo, Mutare, and Gweru to pressure the GOZ for a </p><p>more democratic constitution.  According to an NCA spokesman, </p><p>a demonstration was also planned for Masvingo, but police </p><p>refused to permit that march. </p><p> </p><p>Police Response </p><p>--------------- </p><p>3. (U) One day before the event, armed with a search warrant, </p><p>police raided NCA offices in Harare and arrested seventeen </p><p>NCA staff members including acting National Coordinator, </p><p>Ernest Mudzenge, and acting Information Officer, Tsitsi </p><p>Mutongi.  During the raid, police confiscated lists of NCA </p><p>committee members with phone numbers, financial records, </p><p>banners, t-shirts, pamphlets and other march materials.  Five </p><p>people were also arrested during the march in Bulawayo.  Riot </p><p>police dispersed demonstrators in Mabvuku and Mbare West in </p><p>Harare, and also at the demonstrations in Bulawayo and </p><p>Mutare, but in other places the marches proceeded without </p><p>incident. </p><p> </p><p>Numbers Involved </p><p>---------------- </p><p>4. (U) According to NCA Chairman Lovemore Madhuku, 250 - 300 </p><p>people attended each of the demonstrations in Highfield, </p><p>Zengeza, Kuwadzana, Glen Norah, Mabvuku and Mbare (all </p><p>suburbs of Harare), and Bulawayo, Mutare and Gweru.  NCA has </p><p>been holding bi-weekly demonstrations in selected areas for </p><p>the past year generally involving about 150 - 200 people, and </p><p>plans to continue to organize them.  (Note: One NCA estimate </p><p>puts the number of participants at 8000 nationwide for this </p><p>latest march, but 2500 is a more likely estimate.  End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>Need to Coordinate Efforts </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>5. (U) According to Brian Raftopoulos, Coordinator of the </p><p>Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition and a well-respected political </p><p>analyst, although NCA was able to increase the numbers for </p><p>these demonstrations, alone they are unlikely to have much </p><p>effect.  He said "the people" have not yet taken ownership of </p><p>NCA\'s demonstrations, and the effort is too narrow. </p><p>Raftopoulos, whose Crisis group is sponsoring a major </p><p>conference with churches and civic groups in Bulawayo on </p><p>December 14 to discuss land reform, governance, human rights, </p><p>justice, HIV, and regional solidarity, recommended that NCA </p><p>coordinate its demonstrations with the efforts and issues of </p><p>other civic groups to support a broader approach to problems </p><p>in Zimbabwe.  He said this was the only way to be effective. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>6. (C) Although NCA\'s demonstrations may have involved a </p><p>total of 2-3000 people, we are inclined to agree with </p><p>Raftopoulos\' assessment that "the people" have not taken </p><p>ownership of them yet.  Other civic leaders have suggested </p><p>that public confrontations with government are forthcoming, </p><p>but our sense is that the anger of most Zimbabweans at their </p><p>government is currently outweighed by the day-to-day need to </p><p>put food on the table, coupled with the fear of retribution. </p><p>The success of a national stayaway planned for December 10 by </p><p>the NCA and other civic groups, in conjunction with the MDC, </p><p>will be a revealing test of whether Zimbabweans have </p><p>concluded that confrontation with the GOZ and its security </p><p>forces is the only means of changing their lives for the </p><p>better.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
