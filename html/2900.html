<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001117 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD (COX AND ROBERTSON), AF/S (KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER), AF/RA (DIPALMA), INR/R/MR </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS FACE TRIAL OVER </p><p>"BEHEADING" STORY </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING </p><p> </p><p>1.   (U) A magistrate in Harare has ruled that two of the </p><p>    three journalists arrested last week for violating the </p><p>    Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) </p><p>    must stand trial.  American citizen Andrew Meldrum, local </p><p>    correspondent for the "Guardian," and "Daily News" reporter </p><p>    Lloyd Mudiwa are free on what amounts to a personal </p><p>    recognizance bond (no bail), but will have to return to </p><p>    court on May 22.  Mudiwa is accused of writing a false </p><p>    story about a woman allegedly beheaded by ruling party </p><p>    supporters.  Meldrum is charged with repeating the story in </p><p>    the "Guardian."  Both acts are illegal under Section 80 (1) </p><p>    b of the AIPPA.  The magistrate dismissed similar charges </p><p>    against another "Daily News" reporter, Colin Chiwanza. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) In a related development, on May 7 "Daily News" </p><p>    columnist Pius Wakatama was detained and questioned by </p><p>    police in connection with an opinion piece he wrote about </p><p>    the alleged beheading.  Wakatama was "warned and cautioned" </p><p>    and released on his own recognizance.  He will likely have </p><p>    to appear in court later this month on charges of violating </p><p>    AIPPA. </p><p> </p><p>3.   (U) One of the laws being used against journalists, </p><p>    AIPPA (the other is the Public Order and Security Act -- </p><p>    POSA), faces a legal challenge.  Jan Raath (correspondent </p><p>    for Times Group of Newspapers of London, South Press </p><p>    Association and Newsweek), Andrew Meldrum (The Guardian) </p><p>    and Peta Thornycroft (Daily Telegraph) have filed a suit </p><p>    that seeks to have certain sections of the AIPPA declared </p><p>    unconstitutional. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (SBU) Comment: This flurry of legal activity is </p><p>    symptomatic of the continuing pressure the Government of </p><p>    Zimbabwe is bringing to bear against the privately owned </p><p>    and international media.  The draconian AIPPA and POSA give </p><p>    the GoZ a remarkably broad array of options for harassing </p><p>    and intimidating the media.  In interviews and opinion </p><p>    pieces over the May 3-5 weekend, Minister Moyo made clear </p><p>    his attitude toward independent journalists and his </p><p>    intention to bring them into conformity with his view of </p><p>    the appropriate role of the media.  In a television </p><p>    interview, Minister Moyo said that the people arrested in </p><p>    connection with the "beheading" story were "criminals," not </p><p>    journalists.  He went on to say that the government\'s </p><p>    action in this case offered proof that Zimbabwe is </p><p>    determined to apply the rule of law "even to Americans." </p><p> </p><p>5.   (SBU) Comment continued: Government-owned May 3-5 </p><p>    weekend newspapers were full of news reports and opinion </p><p>    pieces supporting Minister Moyo\'s Orwellian view of press </p><p>    freedom.  News articles about police investigations into </p><p>    "false" stories were joined by opinion pieces calling for </p><p>    the ban of independent newspapers.  If we were more </p><p>    cynical, we would suspect Minister Moyo of colluding with </p><p>    the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) to </p><p>    provide concrete evidence of CPJ\'s May 3 assessment that </p><p>    Zimbabwe is one of the world\'s 10 worst places to be a </p><p>    journalist.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
