<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000784 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/S RAYNOR, AF/PDPA DALTON, ECA/A/S/A PIVES, </p><p>APRINCE, JFRISBIE, ECA/A/E/AF AMARTIN </p><p> </p><p>ACCRA FOR REAC NKETEKU </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, OEXC, SCUL </p><p>SUBJECT: UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE REOPENS BUT STUDENTS </p><p>ARE SLOW TO RETURN </p><p> </p><p>REF: A: HARARE 781 </p><p> </p><p>B: HARARE 752 </p><p>C: HARARE 729 </p><p> </p><p>1. The University of Zimbabwe (UZ) officially re- </p><p>opened Tuesday April 22, 2003 and most professors </p><p>returned to work.  Many students, however, have yet to </p><p>arrive on campus, delaying the start of classes.  The </p><p>Ministry of Higher Education closed UZ in February </p><p>2003 in response to a strike by academic staff.  No </p><p>regularly scheduled classes or exams have taken place </p><p>since November 2002, when the faculty members began </p><p>the strike in protest against low salaries and lack of </p><p>benefits. </p><p> </p><p>2. The Ministry of Higher Education announced on </p><p>Thursday April 17 that all University of Zimbabwe </p><p>academic staff would be granted a retention allowance </p><p>valued at 30% of their salaries.  This allowance is to </p><p>be backdated to January 2003.  The 30% retention </p><p>allowance was promised to all lecturers during </p><p>negotiations in December, but was at first only </p><p>granted to staff at the Medical School and not to </p><p>other departments.  The Association of University </p><p>Teachers (AUT, the collective bargaining unit for </p><p>university academic staff) discovered in February 2003 </p><p>that the retention allowance was only paid to Medical </p><p>School staff.  AUT members outside of the Medical </p><p>School then refused to give undergraduate lectures to </p><p>protest the salary discrepancy.  The Ministry of </p><p>Higher Education responded by closing down UZ and </p><p>threatening to fire and replace all the striking </p><p>academics. </p><p> </p><p>3. After announcing the 30% retention allowance, </p><p>University of Zimbabwe Vice-Chancellor Levy Nyagura </p><p>proclaimed that classes would resume on Tuesday April </p><p>22 (after the long Easter holiday weekend) and that </p><p>all students and staff should plan to return to </p><p>campus.  Nyagura explained that a revised schedule </p><p>would be implemented in order to make up for class </p><p>time missed since the university was shut down in </p><p>November 2002.  Classes will now be held from April 22 </p><p>until May 5 when exams originally scheduled for </p><p>December 2002 will be held.  The second semester will </p><p>begin on May 19 with classes running until the middle </p><p>of July and final examinations ending in early August. </p><p>The next academic year will begin in September, </p><p>switching UZ back to an American-style school </p><p>calendar. </p><p> </p><p>4. Press reports on April 23 indicated that although </p><p>many teachers returned to campus, most students did </p><p>not.  Classes therefore did not resume April 22 as </p><p>most lecture hall seats were empty.  Some students may </p><p>not have heard that the campus had reopened and </p><p>classes resumed, as a large number of UZ students come </p><p>from rural areas of Zimbabwe with limited access to </p><p>news.  Other students have undoubtedly been delayed by </p><p>transport problems.  The price of fuel more than </p><p>doubled in Zimbabwe last week (Ref B), causing </p><p>commensurate changes in bus fares.  Some students may </p><p>not have the money on hand to pay for the long journey </p><p>to Harare.  Others may simply be unable to find a </p><p>functioning bus, as Zimbabwe\'s severe fuel shortages </p><p>continue despite the price increase.  Finally, </p><p>politics may play a role in student attendance.  The </p><p>Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) called for a </p><p>3-day stay-away this week to protest against the fuel </p><p>price hike (Ref A).  Some university students may be </p><p>staying home in solidarity with the ZCTU protest. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Comment:  The Government of Zimbabwe seems to have </p><p>appeased the UZ professors\' salary demands, at least </p><p>in the short term.  However, contacts at the </p><p>university have told us that conditions are now ripe </p><p>for student unrest and that further disruptions to the </p><p>semester are likely.  Most students receive loans from </p><p>the government to cover tuition, accommodation, and </p><p>living expenses.  After paying their fees to the </p><p>university, they are left with about z$60,000 (about </p><p>US$43 at current market rates) per year to pay for </p><p>food, transport, books, and other expenses.  This </p><p>means that a student is expected to live on z$5000 </p><p>(about US$3.50) per month.  Bread, for example, now </p><p>costs z$300 per loaf.  A medium-sized pizza is z$2000. </p><p>A round-trip bus ticket to Harare\'s high-density </p><p>suburbs costs over z$1000.  A weekly newspaper costs </p><p>z$500.  It is clear that students will be hard-pressed </p><p>to survive on z$5000 per month, and student protests </p><p>to demand higher government stipends are possible. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
