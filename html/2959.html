SUMMARY: THE SECOND CONSULTATION SESSION ON THE SIXTH </p><p>REPLENISHMENT OF RESOURCES FOR THE INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR </p><p>AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT (IFAD) WAS HELD APRIL 18-19, </p><p>2002 IN ROME.  MARK JASKOWIAK (DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF </p><p>SPECIALIZED DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTIONS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF </p><p>TREASURY) REPRESENTED THE UNITED STATES AT THE </p><p>CONSULTATION AND AT RELATED CONSULTATIONS HELD WITH LIST </p><p>A (DONOR MEMBER COUNTRIES) AND IFAD MANAGEMENT.  ISSUES </p><p>OF IMPORTANCE THAT WERE DISCUSSED INCLUDED A PROPOSAL BY </p><p>MANAGEMENT ENTITLED ""OPERATIONALIZING IFAD\'S STRATEGIC </p><p>FRAMEWORK;"" A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC POLICY ISSUES SUCH AS </p><p>IFAD\'S FIELD PRESENCE, PERFORMANCE-BASED LENDING SYSTEM, </p><p>RESULTS-ORIENTED ACTION PLANS; AND VARIOUS REPLENISHMENT- </p><p>LEVEL SCENARIOS INCLUDING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE USE OF </p><p>ADVANCE COMMITMENT AUTHORITY AND LENDING LEVELS.  THE </p><p>NEXT CONSULTATION WILL BE HELD JULY 2-3, 2002. END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>OPERATIONALIZING IFAD\'S STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK:.     PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED </p><p>IFAD\'S PROPOSED STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AND COMMENDED THE </p><p>EFFORT OF BOTH STAFF AND MANAGEMENT.  THE CONSENSUS </p><p>HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DOCUMENT AND THE NEED </p><p>TO FURTHER DEVELOP IT AS A STRATEGIC TOOL TO GUIDE THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION\'S ACTIVITIES AND RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS. </p><p>DELEGATES FROM THE NETHERLANDS, UNITED KINGDOM, AND </p><p>SWITZERLAND WERE AMONG THOSE DELEGATIONS THAT CALLED FOR </p><p>MORE DETAILED INFORMATION (I.E., SIMILAR TO A CORPORATE </p><p>PLAN) IN THE REPORT. ERITREA, MEXICO, BRAZIL AND ITALY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02415  01 OF 02  161556Z </p><p>SUPPORTED BOTH THE DOCUMENT AND THE REGIONAL ALLOCATION </p><p>SYSTEM.  USDEL OUTLINED ITS POLICY PRIORITIES FOR THE </p><p>REPLENISHMENT, INCLUDING: 1) THAT THE DOCUMENT INCLUDE </p><p>MORE DETAILS WITH RESPECT TO THE FOLLOWING: THE CURRENT </p><p>ALLOCATION PROCESS, REGIONAL STRATEGIES, AND THE NEED TO </p><p>DEVELOP A PERFORMANCE-BASED ALLOCATION SYSTEM FOR IFAD; </p><p>2) THE NEED FOR MORE QUANTIFIABLE MEASURES TO PREDICT AND </p><p>ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF IFAD AND ITS PROJECTS; AND 3) </p><p>IFAD\'S CATALYTIC ROLE WITH OTHER MDBS, GOVERNMENTS AND </p><p>THE PRIVATE SECTOR, SHOULD BE FURTHER ARTICULATED.  THE </p><p>U.S. WILL CIRCULATE A MORE DETAILED PAPER ON POLICY </p><p>REFORM BEFORE THE NEXT REPLENISHMENT MEETING IN JULY. </p><p>MANAGEMENT WILL REDRAFT THIS STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT </p><p>FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION DURING THE JULY 2002 </p><p>REPLENISHMENT CONSULTATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>FIELD PRESENCE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  THE ISSUE OF IFAD\'S FIELD PRESENCE WAS RAISED BY MANY </p><p>DELEGATIONS DURING THE COURSE OF DELIBERATIONS. </p><p>DISCUSSIONS IN SUPPORT OF THIS ISSUE WERE FOCUSED ON </p><p>IMPROVING IFAD\'S ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN POLICY </p><p>DIALOGUE, ADVOCATE FOR POLICY CHANGE, BUILD STRONGER </p><p>PARTNERSHIPS, AND CO-FINANCE PROJECTS.  MOST DELEGATIONS </p><p>AGREED THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE IFAD\'S PERFORMANCE </p><p>AT THE COUNTRY-LEVEL, BUT WERE SOMEWHAT RESERVED IN THEIR </p><p>SUPPORT OF FIELD PRESENCE.  USDEL SUGGESTED THAT IN ORDER </p><p>TO HAVE A MORE MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION ON FIELD PRESENCE, </p><p>MORE INFORMATION WAS NEEDED REGARDING THE DEFINITION OF </p><p>FIELD PRESENCE AND LONG-TERM BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  02415  01 OF 02  161556Z </p><p>USDEL ALSO STRESSED THAT SINCE FIELD PRESENCE RELATES TO </p><p>IFAD\'S ORIGINAL MANDATE AS A NON-IMPLEMENTING AGENCY, ANY </p><p>PROPOSED POLICY CHANGE WOULD REQUIRE APPROVAL BY THE </p><p>GOVERNING COUNCIL IF NOT A CHARTER REVISION AS WELL. </p><p>MANAGEMENT WILL PROVIDE A PAPER ON IFAD FIELD PRESENCE </p><p>FOR DISCUSSION AT THE NEXT REPLENISHMENT CONSULTATION IN </p><p>JULY 2002. </p><p> </p><p>PERFORMANCE-BASED LENDING </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF BETTER UTILIZING IFAD\'S SCARCE </p><p>RESOURCES AND ITS SPECIAL MANDATE TO REDUCE POVERTY AMONG </p><p>THE RURAL POOR, THE USDEL EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF A PERFORMANCE-BASED SYSTEM OF ALLOCATING </p><p>LOANS.  SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD HAVE THE SAME OVERALL GOAL AS </p><p>MODELS CURRENTLY IN USE AT OTHER IFIS, BUT WOULD BE </p><p>TAILORED TO IFAD\'S PARTICULAR MISSION, SIZE, AND </p><p>CAPACITY.  ALLOCATIONS BASED ON COUNTRY PERFORMANCE WOULD </p><p>BETTER ENABLE IFAD TO TARGET LIMITED RESOURCES MORE </p><p>EFFECTIVELY.  MOST DELEGATIONS, WHILE EXPRESSING GENERAL </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE CONCEPT OF PERFORMANCE-BASED LENDING, </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ3551 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  02415  02 OF 02  161556Z </p><p>ACTION IO-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  COME-00  CTME-00 </p><p>      DODE-00  ITCE-00  SRPP-00  EB-00    EXME-00  EUR-00   UTED-00 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   NSAE-00  OES-01   OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00  SAS-00     /006W </p><p>                  ------------------AF7E79  161602Z /38 </p><p>R 161542Z MAY 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 3782 </p><p>USMISSION USUN NEW YORK </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p>INFO USDA FAS WASHDC 2135 </p><p>DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 ROME 002415 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR WSCHUERCH, MJASKOWIAK, JP PASSINO </p><p>USDA FOR FAS/LYNN REICH AND DAVID WINKELMAN </p><p>STATE FOR IO/EDA ROSE BERSTEIN </p><p>USAID FOR AA/PPC;DAA/G/EGAD;AFS </p><p> </p><p>FROM FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS:  AORC, IFAD, EAID </p><p>SUBJECT:  REPORT OF IFAD SECOND CONSULTATION ON THE SIXTH </p><p>REPLENISHMENT </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  02415  02 OF 02  161556Z </p><p>EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THIS COULD BE VIEWED AS PUNITIVE </p><p>TO THOSE IN MOST NEED.  THEY WOULD PREFER TO USE THE </p><p>CURRENT REGIONAL SYSTEM OF ALLOCATIONS, WHICH STAFF </p><p>DESCRIBED AS BASED LARGELY ON NEED (NOT PERFORMANCE) AND </p><p>WHICH HAS NOT BEEN UP-DATED SINCE 1997, DESPITE AGREEMENT </p><p>DURING THE LAST REPLENISHMENT THAT IT NEEDED </p><p>MODIFICATIONS.  UNDER THIS APPROACH, PERFORMANCE WOULD BE </p><p>CONSIDERED PRIMARILY AT THE PROJECT LEVEL.  AT THE </p><p>REQUEST OF THE USDEL, MANAGEMENT WILL PROVIDE BOTH A </p><p>REPORT ON THE CURRENT ALLOCATION PROCESS USED BY IFAD AND </p><p>A PROPOSAL FOR A NEW ALLOCATION SYSTEM BASED ON </p><p>PERFORMANCE FOR DISCUSSION AT THE JULY MEETING. </p><p> </p><p>REPLENISHMENT LEVEL SCENARIOS </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  NO SPECIFIC LEVEL OF COMMITMENT WAS MADE BY ANY </p><p>COUNTRY DURING THIS SESSION AND NO CONSENSUS WAS REACHED </p><p>ON THE OVERALL LEVEL OR ON TARGET LENDING PROGRAMS.  MANY </p><p>COUNTRIES EXPRESSED GENERAL SUPPORT FOR BOTH, HOWEVER. </p><p>MEMBERS WERE PROVIDED WITH A SERIES OF REPLENISHMENT </p><p>LEVEL SCENARIOS FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES.  THE SCENARIOS </p><p>SHOWED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FUND\'S LENDING </p><p>PROGRAM AND ITS INVESTMENT INCOME AND DIFFERENT </p><p>REPLENISHMENT LEVELS.  CONCERN WAS EXPRESSED BY THE USDEL </p><p>AND OTHER MEMBERS REGARDING IFAD\'S INCREASING RELIANCE ON </p><p>ADVANCE COMMITMENT AUTHORITY (ACA).  USDEL STATED THAT </p><p>ACA SHOULD BE USED CAUTIOUSLY FOR TEMPORARY SHORTFALLS </p><p>ONLY AND THAT IT IS FINANCIALLY UNSOUND TO BASE </p><p>REPLENISHMENT PROPERTIES ON A PERMANENT AND RISING LEVEL </p><p>OF ACA.  THE USDEL CALLED FOR ILLUSTRATIVE TABLES ON </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  02415  02 OF 02  161556Z </p><p>COUNTRY-SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS FOR REPLENISHMENT LEVELS </p><p>INCLUDING FLAT (SAME AS IFAD V) AND SEVERAL INCREASED </p><p>LEVELS (E.G., 10, 25, AND 50 PERCENT). OTHER MEMBERS ALSO </p><p>REQUESTED INFORMATION ON ACA USE IN OTHER INTERNATIONAL </p><p>FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND A TECHNICAL NOTE ON THE PERIOD </p><p>TO BE USED FOR SETTING THE EXCHANGE RATES FOR </p><p>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SIXTH REPLENISHMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MOST DELEGATIONS NOTED THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE </p><p>SECRETARIAT IN MOBILIZING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR IFAD\'S </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>PARTICIPATION IN THE DEBT INITIATIVE FOR HEAVILY INDEBTED </p><p>POOR COUNTRIES (HIPC).  USDEL, WHILE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE </p><p>OF ANY PROSPECTIVE BILATERAL CONTRIBUTIONS DONORS MIGHT </p><p>ELECT TO MAKE FOR THIS PURPOSE, CONSIDERED THAT SUPPORT </p><p>FOR THE HIPC TRUST FUND WAS UNLIKELY GIVEN ITS EXISTING </p><p>USD $700M SHORTFALL. IFAD MANAGEMENT COMMITTED TO </p><p>PROVIDING MEMBERS WITH UPDATED INFORMATION ON HIPC FOR </p><p>THE JULY 2002 REPLENISHMENT NEGOTIATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>7. THE NEXT CONSULTATION WILL BE HELD JULY 2-3, 2002. </p><p>HEILEMAN </p><p> </p><p>END </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME02415 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
