<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 009181 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB AND EUR/SE </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/OEURA/CDP/DDEFALCO </p><p>STATE PASS USTR - NOVELLI AND BIRDSEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EINV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKISH GOVERNMENT FULLY RESOLVES CITIBANK TAX </p><p>PROBLEM </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 8255 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Citibank General Manager for Turkey Mark Robinson </p><p>informed us December 23 that Turkish Finance Minister Kemal </p><p>Unakitan reversed a Finance Ministry tax assessment of </p><p>Citibank and its foreign clients who invest in Turkish </p><p>T-bills through Citibank.  As described reftel, a Finance </p><p>Ministry tax inspector had earlier denied Citibank\'s clients </p><p>the preferred foreign investor tax rate on T-bill income (11 </p><p>percent versus the normal rate of 44 percent), and made an </p><p>enormous assessment of back taxes.  Citibank received the </p><p>formal MinFin letter canceling this assessment December 28. </p><p>Robinson thanked us for Embassy\'s help in resolving this tax </p><p>problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Comment:  A Victory, But Also An Explanation </p><p>for Turkey\'s Risk Premium </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Unakitan\'s action to cancel this tax assessment </p><p>averts potential damage to the T-bill market. Citibank wanted </p><p>this claim resolved before year-end, at which time fund </p><p>managers would have had to disclose this tax claim to their </p><p>investors.  Unakitan\'s action also gives us an early example </p><p>of the new GOT\'s interest in helping to resolve foreign </p><p>investment tangles with the Turkish bureaucracy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Nevertheless, as Citibank country risk manager </p><p>Peter Rossiter commented, this kind of outrageous tax </p><p>assessment helps explain why there is a large risk premium on </p><p>Turkish T-bills. Unpredictability of regulatory and legal </p><p>treatment is a big factor.  Rossiter said Citibank would </p><p>follow up this victory by working with the Turkish Ministry </p><p>of Finance to clarify the tax regulatory treatment of foreign </p><p>investors and thus ensure that such assessments won\'t be </p><p>levied in the future. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
