<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 004849 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, KISL, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: POLL RESULTS REFLECT GROWING POPULAR DESIRE FOR </p><p>POLITICAL PARTICIPATION </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman, per Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Summary </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  A Jordanian pollster who has conducted a number of </p><p>studies in the country over the past several years believes </p><p>that there is a growing disconnect between government </p><p>pronouncements on democracy and the popular perception of </p><p>Jordanian "half-democracy."  In a recent conversation with </p><p>Pol Intern, he discussed a variety of issues including:  rule </p><p>of law and justice; the persistence of elements of </p><p>authoritarianism; the role and durability of parliamentary </p><p>blocs; controversial "temporary laws;" and municipal </p><p>elections.  His research points to the conclusion that </p><p>Jordanians desire a more inclusive and open political sphere </p><p>that promotes a real program of democratization. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  With the end of the war in Iraq and violence down in </p><p>the West Bank, Jordanians are now more likely to turn their </p><p>attention to domestic issues.  Embassy contacts echo what we </p><p>have heard anecdotally from both government officials and </p><p>non-governmental leaders, and the pollster\'s conclusions </p><p>bolster what seems to be a rise in popular calls for greater </p><p>participation.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>Polls Not Always Pleasant </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  Pol Intern met July 17 with Dr. Fares Braizat, </p><p>coordinator of the Center for Strategic Studies\' Opinion </p><p>Polling Unit at the University of Jordan.  Braizat earned a </p><p>Ph.D. in politics and government from the University of </p><p>Canterbury, England, and has published a number of studies on </p><p>politics, culture, and democratization.  He claimed that he </p><p>and his colleagues at the Center have come under government </p><p>fire in the past for poll results which did not mesh with the </p><p>government\'s desired results.  On more than one occasion, he </p><p>claimed, the Center was on the verge of being shut down. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>Anti-Government Forces </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  In three recent polls, Braizat surveyed random </p><p>samples of people nationally, in Palestinian refugee camps </p><p>and in the conservative city of Ma an.  While there is some </p><p>measure of discontent with the government and pace of </p><p>democratization across the board, Ma an was statistically </p><p>worse than the other two samples.  Its population\'s generally </p><p>pessimistic attitudes toward the central government, which </p><p>boiled over into streets protests in 1989, the mid-1990s, and </p><p>2002, were reflected in the way the Ma an community ranked </p><p>Jordanian democracy behind all countries in the region, </p><p>including Israel and Saudi Arabia.  Surveying attitudes of </p><p>the residents of Ma an, Braizat found that most do not </p><p>believe the government does enough to promote </p><p>democratization, the rule of law, and a fair system of </p><p>justice.  Rather, they seem to believe that the grievances </p><p>they hold today are essentially those which first sparked </p><p>violence fourteen years ago. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  With no generally recognized channel of </p><p>communication with the central government and a system of </p><p>patronage that does not seem to reach all sectors of Ma an\'s </p><p>conservative society, people there will continue to feel </p><p>isolated and resentful of governmental operations nationally, </p><p>Braizat posited.  He suspects that if the trend of general </p><p>dissatisfaction with community-government relations and the </p><p>perceived lackluster performance of MPs continues, Jordan </p><p>could see "more Ma ans" in the future.  In particular, he </p><p>points to the Bani Hamida community in central, rural Jordan, </p><p>as the most likely new candidate for unrest in the next two </p><p>years.  While dissatisfaction does not necessarily mean </p><p>violence is likely, Braizat did suggest that the same </p><p>conditions exist today between Bani Hamida and the government </p><p>as they did between Ma an and Amman.  (Comment:  An academic </p><p>told PolCouns recently that the Bani Hamida had elected three </p><p>young and well educated MPs, and he expected that they would </p><p>press Bani Hamida interests in Parliament -- perhaps reducing </p><p>some of this pressure.  End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Popular Concerns </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  In general, according to Braizat, the optimism that </p><p>greeted the ascension of King Abdullah II in 1999 has faded. </p><p>Also in decline is the percentage of people who feel their </p><p>civil and political rights are safeguarded by the state </p><p>(hovering around 15 percent).  The vast majority of </p><p>Jordanians, he said, feel that their fiscal contributions to </p><p>the government benefit an elite 10 percent of the population. </p><p> In addition, Braizat said most people report eroding respect </p><p>for the institutions of governance since the early 1990s: </p><p>for example, more than 50 percent of the population believe </p><p>it is difficult to find justice in Jordanian courtrooms.  The </p><p>population also feels its government has corrupted and </p><p>systematically undermined Parliament through rewarding MPs </p><p>with automobiles and other fringe benefits, Braizat claimed. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>The Persistence of the Political System </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  Foreign aid programs, argued Braizat, are failing to </p><p>create a new democratic structure for Jordan; rather, they </p><p>reinforce "authoritarian patterns."  In terms of the King\'s </p><p>own approach to development in tribal areas, Braizat </p><p>criticized the government\'s distribution of money to satisfy </p><p>short-term "begging letters" (individual and tribal petitions </p><p>to the King) from Bedouins and instead advocated a more </p><p>sustainable approach to development in those areas of the </p><p>country most dependent on governmental support. </p><p> </p><p>------------------- </p><p>Parliamentary Blocs </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  According to polling done in the past, Braizat found </p><p>15 percent of Jordanians feel the Islamic Action Front (IAF) </p><p>represents their political, social, and economic aspirations. </p><p> The next most popular party, former Parliament speaker Abdul </p><p>Hadi Majali\'s Constitutional Bloc, garnered only one percent. </p><p> The remaining 74 percent of the population is tribal in its </p><p>orientation and represents a significant swing-vote for </p><p>Jordanian lawmakers. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>Mechanisms of Governance </p><p>------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C)  Braizat\'s polling data suggests that while </p><p>Jordanians are on the whole dissatisfied with certain aspects </p><p>of their political system, they are eager to work within it </p><p>to produce change.  Citizens are less impressed with </p><p>individual political actors then with their Parliament and </p><p>other mechanisms of governance. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C)  That said, he believes that the large number of </p><p>laws promulgated by the government (including 17 in the days </p><p>before parliamentary elections), appointment of half of city </p><p>council members, and other government steps contribute to the </p><p>popular perception that Jordan is "half-democratic."  He </p><p>concluded that transparency and accountability are not only </p><p>necessary in Jordanian politics today, but are also </p><p>increasingly demanded by a frustrated population. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C)  As the war in Iraq recedes and the Middle East </p><p>peace process shows signs of real progress (especially a </p><p>reduction of violence in the West Bank), many Jordanians are </p><p>likely to focus on concerns even closer to home such as the </p><p>economy and political participation.  Breizat\'s unreleased </p><p>polling research confirms what we are hearing anecdotally </p><p>from a growing number of our contacts -- members of </p><p>Parliament, political analysts, pundits, and the press:  that </p><p>Jordanians want to feel more included in the process of </p><p>government.  Several MPs and senior staff at the Palace have </p><p>mentioned to us recently their recognition of a growing </p><p>popular desire for more democracy.  Whether the government </p><p>and Palace respond with concrete progress remains to be seen, </p><p>but the return of Parliament is a good first step. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C)  The opening of Parliament has already widened the </p><p>space for political discourse in Jordan.  Along with this </p><p>increase in politics is likely to come an increase in the </p><p>number and volume of gripes and complaints against the </p><p>government.  The government will have to thicken its skin to </p><p>this noise if it is going to pursue greater participation. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
