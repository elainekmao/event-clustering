PROTEST ACTIVITY </p><p>IS SPREADING, BUT THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR (MOI) HAS </p><p>IMPLEMENTED A GOOD SECURITY PLAN TO ENSURE THE SAFE PASSAGE </p><p>OF ONE REMAINING TRAIN, SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE AT CAMP DARBY ON </p><p>FEBRUARY 27.  THE GOI HAS MADE CLEAR ITS INTENT TO DEPLOY ALL </p><p>MEANS NECESSARY--INCLUDING THE USE OF FORCE AGAINST THOSE </p><p>BREAKING THE LAW--TO COUNTER THE "TRAINSTOPPING" ACTIVISTS. </p><p>IN THE EVENT THREATENED DOCKWORKER STRIKES MATERIALIZE AT </p><p>LIVORNO, A COMMERCIAL PORT NEAR DARBY, U.S. MILITARY </p><p>OFFICIALS BELIEVE THEY SHOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH EVENTUAL </p><p>LOADING OF EQUIPMENT ON SHIPS BOUND FOR SW ASIA.

SETAF HAS STRICTLY FOLLOWED </p><p>NOTIFICATION CHAINS AND IS WORKING INTENSIVELY WITH LAW </p><p>ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO ENSURE SAFE AND TIMELY MOVEMENT OF </p><p>THE TRAINS, WHICH ARE TRAVELING WITH U.S. SERVICEMEN AND </p><p>ITALIAN CARABINIERI ABOARD.  ODC ROME IS COORDINATING CLOSELY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  00810  01 OF 02  261816Z </p><p>WITH THE MOI ON STRATEGY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) THE MOI\'S DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SECURITY HAS SET UP A </p><p>CRISIS CENTER TO MONITOR EVENTS AND WORK TACTICS TOGETHER </p><p>WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE NATIONAL RAILROAD (FERROVIE DI </p><p>STATO).  A SYSTEM OF COUNTERMEASURES HAS BEEN ACTIVATED WHICH </p><p>INCLUDES HEAVY SURVEILLANCE OF THE PROTESTER\'S </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS, DEPLOYMENT OF HUNDREDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT </p><p>OFFICERS AT KEY POINTS ALONG TRAIN ROUTES, AND MOVING </p><p>EQUIPMENT BY NIGHT.  THE GOI, BY PLAYING A CAT AND MOUSE GAME </p><p>WITH THE TRAINS--OFTEN SHIFTING ROUTES ON SHORT NOTICE--HAS </p><p>BEEN ABLE KEEP THE PROTESTERS OFF BALANCE. </p><p> </p><p>4.

ACTIVISTS </p><p>BLOCKING CIVILIAN TRAIN LINES ARE SUBJECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>FINES OF UP TO 10,000 EUROS, BUT COULD ALSO BE ACCUSED OF </p><p>"PROHIBITING A PUBLIC SERVICE," WHICH IS PUNISHABLE BY UP TO </p><p>ONE YEAR IN PRISON.  BLOCKING THE MOVEMENT OF A "MILITARY </p><p>TRAIN" IS A FELONY FOR WHICH A PERPETRATOR, IF FOUND GUILTY, </p><p>WOULD FACE A MINIMUM OF EIGHT YEARS IN PRISON.  DURING THE </p><p>"TRAINSTOPPINGS" THAT BEGAN ON FEBRUARY 21, NO ACTIVIST HAS </p><p>YET BEEN CHARGED WITH COMMITTING AN ILLEGAL ACT. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  ON FEBRUARY 25, SETAF, AFTER CONSULTING WITH LOCAL </p><p>LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES, DECIDED TO DELAY THE LOADING OF </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  00810  01 OF 02  261816Z </p><p>TWO TRAINS THAT HAD BEEN SCHEDULED FOR THE MORNING OF </p><p>FEBRUARY 26.  ODC ROME SUBSEQUENTLY INFORMED MOI ABOUT THE </p><p>DELAY.  SETAF MADE THE DECISION AFTER BEING APPRISED THAT A </p><p>LARGE DEMONSTRATION AT THE GRISIGNANO DI ZOCCO STATION (NEAR </p><p>VICENZA) WAS LIKELY AT THE SAME TIME LOADING WAS TO HAVE </p><p>BEGUN (NOTE: THE DEMONSTRATION CONSISTING OF SOME TWO-HUNDRED </p><p>ACTIVISTS UNFOLDED AS EXPECTED).  MOREOVER, A "NATIONAL DAY </p><p>OF ACTION" TO INCLUDE WIDESPREAD SIT-INS ON TRACKS THROUGHOUT </p><p>NORTHERN ITALY IS BEING STAGED WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 26 BY THE </p><p>SOCIAL FORUM, A COALITION OF "NO GLOBAL" GROUPS, AND THE </p><p>"DISOBEDIENTS" (REF B).  THE TWO TRAINS WILL NOW BE MERGED </p><p>INTO ONE LONGER TRAIN AND LOADED AT 2100 ON FEBRUARY 26.
