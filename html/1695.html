REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE VIOLENCE REPORTED REFTEL HAS CONTINUED </p><p>UNABATED IN MASVINGO TOWN IN THE RUNUP TO THE MAYORAL </p><p>ELECTION MAY 12-13, WITH CONTINUING SKIRMISHES BETWEEN </p><p>SUPPORTERS OF THE RULING ZANU-PF AND THOSE OF THE </p><p>OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC). </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS," ZANU-PF </p><p>MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT AND WAR VETERAN LEADER CHENJERAI </p><p>"HITLER" HUNZVI IS CIRCULATING WITH AN AK-47 RIFLE, </p><p>ACCOMPANIED BY OTHER ARMED WAR VETERANS, AS HE </p><p>SUPERVISES THE LATEST CHAPTER IN THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ONGOING TERROR CAMPAIGN AGAINST OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS. </p><p>GANDI MUDZINGWA, PERSONAL ASSISTANT TO MDC PRESIDENT </p><p>MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, TOLD POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF ON MAY </p><p>11 THAT POLICE HAVE ESTABLISHED A HEAVY PRESENCE ON </p><p>ALL ROADS INTO MASVINGO, AND ARE SEARCHING ALL </p><p>VEHICLES CARRYING MORE THAN FIVE PASSENGERS.  A SENIOR </p><p>POLICE OFFICIAL IN MASVINGO CONFIRMED TO JOURNALISTS </p><p>THAT SOME POLICE OFFICERS WERE BEING INVESTIGATED FOR </p><p>PARTICIPATING ACTIVELY IN ZANU-PF\'S "CAMPAIGN TEAMS." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) ZANU-PF SUPPORTERS REPORTEDLY ORDERED ALL </p><p>BUSINESSES IN TOWN TO CLOSE ON MAY 10 SO THAT WORKERS </p><p>COULD ATTEND CAMPAIGN RALLIES ADDRESSED BY VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENTS SIMON MUZENDA AND JOSEPH MSIKA, AND OTHER </p><p>SENIOR ZANU-PF OFFICIALS.  ONE BUSINESSMAN CONDEMNED </p><p>THE ACTION, SAYING "IT IS IRRATIONAL FOR A PARTY TO </p><p>ORDER THE CLOSURE OF ALL BUSINESSES WHEN THE ECONOMY </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01584  01 OF 02  111109Z </p><p>OF THE COUNTRY IS AILING."  ANOTHER SAID HE HAD BEEN </p><p>THREATENED BY WAR VETERANS WITH DEATH IF HE DID NOT </p><p>CLOSE SO HAD HAD NO OTHER CHOICE.  MEANWHILE, 18 MDC </p><p>SUPPORTERS APPEARED IN COURT ON MAY 11 ON CHARGES OF </p><p>INCITING VIOLENCE AND WERE RELEASED ON BAIL, WHILE </p><p>FOUR REMAINED IN DETENTION BECAUSE THEY HAD VIOLATED </p><p>PREVIOUS BAIL RESTRICTIONS.  ACCORDING TO PRESS </p><p>REPORTS, NOT A SINGLE ZANU-PF SUPPORTER OR WAR VETERAN </p><p>HAS BEEN ARRESTED OR CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE </p><p>VIOLENCE WHICH HAS MARRED THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF THE </p><p>MAYORAL CAMPAIGN, ALTHOUGH FOLLOWERS OF BOTH OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S LARGEST PARTIES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN </p><p>SKIRMISHES. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) LONGTIME ZANU-PF POLITICIAN EDDISON ZVOBGO -- </p><p>WHO HAILS FROM MASVINGO PROVINCE AND RETAINS </p><p>SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE THERE -- PREDICTED TO CHARGE ON </p><p>MAY 10 THAT NEITHER ZANU-PF NOR THE MDC WOULD WIN THE </p><p>MAYORAL ELECTION.  RATHER, INDEPENDENT FEMIAS </p><p>CHAKABUDA WAS THE BEST-KNOWN CANDIDATE IN MASVINGO AND </p><p>WOULD  LIKELY BE THE VICTOR.  CURRENTLY HEAD OF THE </p><p>CITY\'S TAXPAYERS\' ASSOCIATION, CHAKABUDA HAD </p><p>LONGSTANDING TIES TO ZANU-PF AND HAD SERVED ON THE </p><p>CITY COUNCIL FOR TWENTY YEARS, BUT LEFT THE RULING </p><p>PARTY IN DISGUST A YEAR AGO TO JOIN THE MDC.  HE HAD </p><p>INTENDED TO RUN ON THE MDC TICKET FOR MAYOR, BUT HIS </p><p>CANDIDACY WAS NIXED BY THE PARTY\'S NATIONAL </p><p>LEADERSHIP, WHICH DISTRUSTED HIM BECAUSE OF HIS </p><p>PREVIOUS POLITICAL AFFILIATION.  CHAKABUDA THEN </p><p>DECIDED TO STAND AS AN INDEPENDENT. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01584  01 OF 02  111109Z </p><p>4.  (C) ZVOBGO TOLD CHARGE THAT HE HAD TURNED DOWN A </p><p>REQUEST FROM VICE-PRESIDENT MSIKA TO CAMPAIGN FOR THE </p><p>ZANU-PF CANDIDATE.  HE POINTED OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN </p><p>ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN EVERY ELECTION IN MASVINGO SINCE </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, SO HIS STANDING ON THE SIDELINES IN THIS </p><p>CASE WAS IN ITSELF A TELLING STATEMENT.  A ZANU-PF </p><p>LOSS IN THE MAYORAL ELECTION, ZVOBGO ANTICIPATED, </p><p>WOULD SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE TO THE RULING PARTY\'S </p><p>OLD GUARD THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER "IMPOSE" CANDIDATES </p><p>AND LEADERS ON THE ZIMBABWEAN PUBLIC.  THE PEOPLE OF </p><p>MASVINGO, ZVOBGO SAID, ARE "ENORMOUSLY DISENCHANTED" </p><p>WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE, WHO COULD LOSE THE PROVINCE IN </p><p>THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) WE ARE NOT SURPRISED BY THE FERVOR WITH WHICH </p><p>ZANU-PF AND THE MDC ARE CONTESTING THIS MUNICIPAL </p><p>ELECTION.  THE POLITICAL STAKES ARE VERY HIGH IN </p><p>MASVINGO, WHICH MOST OBSERVERS CONSIDER THE KEY </p><p>BATTLEGROUND PROVINCE IN NEXT YEAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.  AS WE INDICATED IN REFTEL, ZANU-PF WANTS TO </p><p>PROVE IT CAN CARRY AN URBAN AREA, AND THE WINNING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8135 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01584  02 OF 02  111109Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DINT-00  DODE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------EA50DA  111109Z /38 </p><p>P 111117Z MAY 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8851 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001584 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 05/07/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINS, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MASVINGO TENSE AS CITY BRACES FOR MAYORAL </p><p>ELECTION </p><p> </p><p>PARTY WILL TRUMPET A VICTORY AS PROOF THAT IT HAS THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  01584  02 OF 02  111109Z </p><p>MOMENTUM HEADING INTO 2002.
