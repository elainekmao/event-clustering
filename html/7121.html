<p>UNCLAS ROME 001443 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>TSA HDQRS FOR OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>BRUSSELS FOR TSA </p><p></p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, ECON, IT, AVIATION, FAA </p><p>SUBJECT: BRITISH AIRWAYS FACING HEIGHTENED SECURITY </p><p>MEASURES IN ITALY </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  DURING THE WEEK OF MARCH 24-27, ECONOFF </p><p>SPOKE WITH THE BRITISH EMBASSY TRANSPORTATION OFFICER </p><p>REGARDING HEIGHTENED SECURITY MEASURES IMPOSED ON BRITISH </p><p>AIRWAYS BY THE TURIN AND MALPENSA AIRPORTS.  ALTHOUGH </p><p>UNLIKELY, U.S. CARRIERS COULD FACE AN ADDITIONAL RESTRICTION </p><p>BANNING CELL PHONES AND LAPTOPS IN THE CABIN.  BRITISH </p><p>AIRWAYS REMAINS THE ONLY AIR CARRIER SUBJECT TO A BAN ON CELL </p><p>PHONES AND UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ITS HEIGHTENED SECURITY STATUS </p><p>IN ITALY.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  A BRITISH EMBASSY TRANSPORTATION OFFICER CALLED </p><p>ECONOFF ON MARCH 24 TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER ITALIAN AIRPORT </p><p>POLICE HAD ORDERED AMERICAN CARRIERS TO BAN LAPTOPS AND CELL </p><p>PHONES IN THE CABIN, WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>ENAC\'S (ITALY\'S CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY) NATIONAL SECURITY </p><p>PROGRAM, SCHEDULE 4, PARAGRAPH 5.1.7, ELECTRONIC APPARATUS, </p><p>INCLUDING CELL PHONES AND LAPTOP COMPUTERS, CAN BE BANNED </p><p>FROM THE CABIN AS LONG AS THE AIR CARRIER HAS BEEN ELEVATED </p><p>TO A "SENSITIVE CARRIER" SECURITY STATUS AND THE LOCAL </p><p>AIRPORT SECURITY AUTHORITIES VOTE TO IMPLEMENT THIS </p><p>RESTRICTION.  THE BRITISH OFFICIAL STATED THAT DESPITE THE </p><p>FACT THAT AMERICAN, ISRAELI AND BRITISH AIR CARRIERS ARE </p><p>LABELED "SENSITIVE CARRIERS," THE AIRPORT IN TURIN IS THE </p><p>ONLY AIRPORT TO IMPLEMENT THIS REGULATION, AND AGAINST ONLY </p><p>ONE AIR CARRIER - BRITISH AIRWAYS.  BRITISH AIRWAYS DOES NOT </p><p>    BAN CELL PHONES AND LAPTOPS FROM ITS LONDON TO TURIN FLIGHTS. </p><p> THE OFFICIAL QUESTIONED WHETHER THIS MIGHT BE A PLOY ON THE </p><p>PART OF THE LOCAL TORINESE AIRPORT AUTHORITY TO INCREASE </p><p>ALITALIA\'S COMPETITIVENESS.  HE WANTED TO RAISE THIS POINT </p><p>WITH THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN CASE SUCH MEASURES WERE </p><p>SUMMARILY APPLIED TO AMERICAN CARRIERS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  ECONOFF THEN SPOKE WITH A DELTA REPRESENTATIVE </p><p>FAMILIAR WITH SCHEDULE 4, PARAGRAPH 5.1.7 WHO STATED THAT TO </p><p>THEIR KNOWLEDGE, THIS REGULATION HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT </p><p>AIRPORTS WITH AN AMERICAN CARRIER PRESENCE, INCLUDING </p><p>FIUMICINO (ROME), MALPENSA (MILAN) AND VENICE.  THE DELTA </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMED THAT PASSENGERS WOULD RIOT IF THIS BAN </p><p>WERE TO BE IMPLEMENTED. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  THE BRITISH OFFICIAL ALSO MENTIONED THAT MALPENSA </p><p>AIRPORT AUTHORITIES HAVE ORDERED BRITISH AIRWAYS TO MOVE ITS </p><p>TICKET COUNTERS NEXT TO THE AMERICAN CARRIERS TICKET </p><p>COUNTERS.  WHILE THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY AGENCY (TSA) </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE IN ROME SUPPORTS THE GROUPING OF "SENSITIVE </p><p>CARRIERS" BECAUSE OF INCREASED MEASURES TO SECURE THAT PART </p><p>OF THE TERMINAL, THE BRITISH OFFICIAL EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT </p><p>CONCENTRATING "COALITION" TICKET COUNTERS IN ONE AREA CREATES </p><p>AN EASIER TARGET.  ADDITIONAL PROBING REVEALED THAT THIS </p><p>OFFICIAL AND THE BRITISH AIRWAYS STAFF SIMPLY DO NOT WANT TO </p><p>BE SITUATED NEXT TO THE AMERICAN CARRIERS AND DO NOT BELIEVE </p><p>THAT THEIR "SENSITIVE CARRIER" STATUS IS JUSTIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U)  OFFICIALS FROM ENAC EXPLAINED THAT THE AIRPORT </p><p>SECURITY COMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY THE AIRPORT DIRECTOR, </p><p>DETERMINES WHICH SECURITY MEASURES SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AT </p><p>    THAT PARTICULAR AIRPORT.  THEY CONFIRMED THAT MALPENSA HAS AN </p><p>AREA DEDICATED TO "SENSITIVE CARRIERS" AND BRITISH AIRWAYS </p><p>WAS ASKED TO MOVE TO THAT AREA TO BENEFIT FROM ADDITIONAL </p><p>SECURITY MEASURES.  THE ENAC OFFICIALS SUGGESTED THAT THE </p><p>AIRPORT SECURITY COMMITTEE IN TURIN MIGHT HAVE FELT THE NEED </p><p>TO IMPLEMENT STRICTER SECURITY MEASURES THAN IS THE NORM AT </p><p>OTHER AIRPORTS BUT WERE UNABLE TO OFFER ANY ADDITIONAL </p><p>INSIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  COMMENT.  THE BRITISH OFFICIAL HAS REQUESTED USG </p><p>SUPPORT IN ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM TO THE GOI.  WHILE WE ARE </p><p>SYMPATHETIC AND WILLING TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO OUR GOI </p><p>CONTACTS, WE REMAIN NEUTRAL IN THE FACE OF AN ISSUE ISOLATED </p><p>TO HMG AND LOCALIZED AIRPORTS.  THE TSA REPRESENTATIVE IS IN </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH, AND SUPPORTS, THE SECURITY MEASURES IN PLACE. </p><p> WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS SITUATION.  END COMMENT. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p> 2003ROME01443 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
