(SBU) SUMMARY: The UAEG\'s much-hyped amnesty </p><p>program has thus far not been as successful as </p><p>government officials had predicted. The amnesty, which </p><p>began on January 1, 2003, and will terminate on April </p><p>30, 2003, will exempt workers from payment of fines or </p><p>other legal liabilities related to their illegal </p><p>immigration status.  Up to 300,000-350,000 illegal </p><p>laborers were originally expected to leave the </p><p>country, but only 30,000 workers have applied so far. </p><p>Though immigration officials still expect a total of </p><p>100,000 illegals to depart the country before the end </p><p>of the program, the UAEG is extremely disappointed </p><p>that the amnesty has not been as successful as </p><p>expected.  The amnesty has been beset by numerous </p><p>problems, including onerous application requirements, </p><p>extensive bureaucratic delays in the processing of </p><p>applications, and fear of a permanent ban from the UAE </p><p>on part of undocumented illegals.  Many workers also </p><p>doubt the seriousness of  the government in cracking </p><p>down on illegal labor after the termination of the </p><p>amnesty period, while others plan to apply just before </p><p>the deadline to make as much money as possible before </p><p>leaving the UAE. To demonstrate its commitment -- and </p><p>encourage wavering illegals to make the right choice - </p><p>- the government recently launched publicized raids to </p><p>arrest illegals and threatened to end visit visas for </p><p>certain nationalities. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE AMNESTY PROGRAM </p><p>------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The government\'s stated purpose in issuing an </p><p>amnesty was to regulate and stabilize the labor market </p><p>by removing marginal and ineffective manpower. An </p><p>estimated 500,000 unemployed or intermittently </p><p>employed expatriates live in the UAE, the vast </p><p>majority of whom are Indian, Filipino, Pakistani, </p><p>Bangladeshi, Iranians and Sri Lankan. Most are blue- </p><p>collar workers. By removing a substantial portion of </p><p>this population, the government intends to correct the </p><p>serious demographic imbalance of the country, </p><p>perceived to be a security risk as well as an actual </p><p>social problem. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The current amnesty is the second such program </p><p>announced by the UAEG to deal with illegal workers in </p><p>the last seven years. (See refs A and B). The 1996 </p><p>Amnesty resulted in 250,000 illegals departing the </p><p>country, but was fraught with confusion and ultimately </p><p>ineffective.  The UAEG failed to track those who left, </p><p>and many workers simply regularized their status and </p><p>returned after a brief stay abroad.  Like the 1996 </p><p>program, the current amnesty exempts workers from </p><p>payment of fines or other legal liabilities related to </p><p>their illegal immigration status, but attempts to </p><p>close the loopholes that made the previous amnesty </p><p>ineffective. </p><p> </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMNESTY FLAWED </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) Labor Attaches of the Embassies of India, Sri </p><p>Lanka, Bangladesh and the Philipines told Econoff that </p><p>illegals generally fall into one of three categories: </p><p>foreigners who entered the UAE illegally, those who </p><p>entered on a legitimate work visa but have overstayed, </p><p>and those who entered on a visitor or transit visa. </p><p>Upon receiving amnesty, individuals in the first </p><p>category are  permanently banned from the UAE, those </p><p>in the second are banned for one year, and those in </p><p>the final category are only required to pay a fine </p><p>upon departure. </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) The Labor Attaches were unanimous in their </p><p>opinion that the primary flaws in the amnesty are </p><p>overly onerous application requirements, bureaucratic </p><p>delays on part of the UAEG, and fear of a permanent </p><p>ban from the UAE on part of undocumented illegals. </p><p>Many workers who have attempted to apply for amnesty </p><p>have been stonewalled by the application process which </p><p>requires them to present an original or a copy of </p><p>their passport, national identity cards (NICs), </p><p>expired visas, and other identifying information. </p><p>Many laborers however, were forced to submit these </p><p>documents to their sponsors and/or employers when they </p><p>arrived in the UAE and failed to regain possession of </p><p>their papers as they either absconded from their </p><p>original employment or moved on to different jobs. </p><p>Illegals are also required to complete a form </p><p>detailing their stay in the country, how they got in, </p><p>who assisted them and how they transferred money out. </p><p>All amnesty seekers are fingerprinted and required to </p><p>submit to a retinal scan. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) This complicated process has resulted in many </p><p>laborers being forced to return to processing centers </p><p>numerous times where they are subject to long waits </p><p>and constant equipment failure.  Since the vast </p><p>majority of amnesty seekers work long hours at low- </p><p>paying, labor intensive jobs, it is neither economical </p><p>nor practical for them to take off the needed hours to </p><p>complete the amnesty process. Those unable to prove </p><p>that they entered legally are permanently banned from </p><p>the UAE at the time they are granted amnesty.  For </p><p>these workers, along with those who entered the UAE </p><p>illegally, there is no incentive to apply for amnesty </p><p>as they will never be allowed to return and their job </p><p>prospects in the UAE are superior to anything they </p><p>will find in their native lands. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) The Labor Attaches also noted that many </p><p>workers were likely waiting until the last possible </p><p>moment before applying for amnesty. The vast majority </p><p>of illegals are males supporting families back in </p><p>their native countries and accordingly will try to </p><p>maximize the amount of money they earn in the UAE </p><p>before returning home. The Attaches also reported that </p><p>many laborers do not believe the authorities will </p><p>crack down on illegal workers as many UAE companies -- </p><p>especially in the construction industry -- depend on </p><p>such workers to keep costs to a minimum. </p><p> </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDS </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) The UAEG has clearly been disappointed that </p><p>more illegals have not taken advantage of the program </p><p>and left the country.  Daily news reports trumpet the </p><p>amnesty program with admonitions from government </p><p>officials warning illegals they will face severe </p><p>penalties, including prison, if they do not apply and </p><p>leave. The government has recently opened more amnesty </p><p>centers and attempted to stream-line the process by </p><p>issuing exit visas within a week of application, but </p><p>officials are still requiring amnesty seekers to file </p><p>the proper paperwork, get fingerprinted and submit to </p><p>a retinal scan. (Note:  The UAE has decided to extend </p><p>the visas -- no matter the type -- of Iraqi nationals </p><p>because they are unable to return to their country due </p><p>to the war.  End note.) </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Though the numbers of amnesty seekers are </p><p>considerably less than expected, UAE officials still </p><p>believe that up to 100,000 workers will depart before </p><p>the program ends.  They have warned illegals not to </p><p>wait until the last minute to apply, but concede that </p><p>is what is most likely happening. The government has </p><p>also launched a series of well-publicized raids </p><p>targeting hide-outs and residences of illegal migrants </p><p>demonstrating its commitment to solving the problem. </p><p>Authorities promise to embark on a large-scale </p><p>operation targeting all areas housing illegals once </p><p>the amnesty program ends. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (U) The government is also planning to introduce </p><p>curbs on visit visas for certain nationalities, though </p><p>no plan has been formally announced. The authorities </p><p>will most likely limit the overall number and create a </p><p>means test for tourist visas for nationals from </p><p>Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the </p><p>Philippines. </p><p>11. (SBU) COMMENT: The UAEG is clearly committed to </p><p>decreasing the number of illegal workers in the </p><p>country and has done an excellent job of marketing the </p><p>amnesty and encouraging individuals to step forward. </p><p>However, in an attempt to correct the mistakes of the </p><p>last amnesty, the government has implemented an </p><p>extremely complicated and difficult process which has </p><p>deterred amnesty seekers from completing their </p><p>applications. Others simply have no incentive to apply </p><p>knowing they will be permanently banned from </p><p>returning.  No matter the success or failure of the </p><p>current amnesty program, the UAEG\'s commitment to </p><p>reducing the population of illegals will be determined </p><p>by its dedication to reducing the exploitation of the </p><p>visa/sponsorship process by Emirati nationals who </p><p>derive significant income from it.  (Ref C).  Last </p><p>year the Ministry of Labour issued 260,000 employment </p><p>visas even though, according to its own assessment, </p><p>approximately half the companies in country are </p><p>fictitious.  As long as a large domestic constituency </p><p>distributes employment visas for their own financial </p><p>benefit, the UAE will continue to have a large illegal </p><p>work force. End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
