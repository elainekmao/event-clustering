<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 000147 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>USCDR PACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: KNNP, PARM, MARR, BM, IAEA, BNUC, RU </p><p>SUBJECT: RUSSIAN MIGS AND REACTORS </p><p> </p><p>REF: 02 RANGOON 942 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Russia now has the only bilateral military </p><p>and technical cooperation agreement with Burma, according to </p><p>a Rangoon-based Russian diplomat. A draft agreement for the </p><p>sale of a 10 megawatt research reactor was approved by the </p><p>Russian government last year and is now under study by the </p><p>GOB.  Twelve MIG-29s have also been delivered though they </p><p>remain bare of weapons packages. End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Military and Technical Cooperation  Agreement </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  A Russian emboff told Poloff on January 30 that </p><p>Russia is the only country that has a military and technical </p><p>cooperation agreement with Burma.  Supposedly, that agreement </p><p>was worked up to provide a framework for the sale of the </p><p>nuclear reactor.  A first set of consultations under the </p><p>agreement was held in Russia in 2002.  The next set will take </p><p>place in Rangoon this year. </p><p> </p><p>Nuclear Reactor </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Russia has approved a "draft agreement" for the sale </p><p>of a 10 megawatt research reactor to Burma, but has still not </p><p>received a response from the GOB, which has been studying the </p><p>agreement since last year.  The Russian officer believes that </p><p>money is the problem; the GOB does not have the $150 million </p><p>that would be required to complete the whole project. </p><p>Nevertheless, it is locked in to working with Russia.  Six </p><p>hundred Burmese students (350 in 2001 and 250 in 2002) have </p><p>already been sent to Moscow for training on all aspects of </p><p>uranium mining and processing, and on reactor operation and </p><p>research.  Once trained on Russian reactors, they\'re not </p><p>going to be able to work on anything else. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) As for uranium, the Russian said that the Burmese have </p><p>identified four deposits and sent samples to Pakistan for </p><p>assessment last year.  Reportedly, the assessment was </p><p>positive; the ore is suitable for processing into reactor </p><p>fuel.  However, it is still not clear how much uranium is </p><p>available in each site.  For that, some further geological </p><p>investigations will be necessary. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) Asked why the GOB would want to spend $150 million of </p><p>money they don\'t have on a reactor, the emboff said that he </p><p>believed the GOB\'s ultimate objective was to become an </p><p>exporter of reactor fuel "in 10 to 20 years."  In any case, </p><p>he insisted that the reactor (a 10 megawatt, light water </p><p>system) was not suitable for the production of weapons.  He </p><p>also said that the North Koreans were not involved in the </p><p>reactor project.  The North Koreans wanted to sell Burma two </p><p>submarines, he said, adding that he did not think they were </p><p>looking to transfer any nuclear technology. </p><p> </p><p>MIG-29s </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Burmese have taken delivery of 12 MIG-29s, but </p><p>have not paid anything other than the initial down payment, </p><p>according to the Russian.  The remaining payments have been </p><p>rescheduled over four years.  Nevertheless, Russia is ready </p><p>to be patient.  MIG-29s have an operational life of about 40 </p><p>years, and the GOB will require spare parts, training, </p><p>maintenance, and upgrades for as long as they maintain their </p><p>MIG fleet.  In other words, the Russians feel they have the </p><p>Burmese hooked and are content to wait for payment on the </p><p>original purchase, so long as that purchase continued to </p><p>throw up opportunities for further sales.   Reportedly, the </p><p>MIG-29s are so far bare of any weapons packages.  The Russian </p><p>Emboff speculated that they may have some political value to </p><p>the GOB, as indicators of the GOB\'s long-term ambitions for </p><p>the air force, but right now were essentially useless as </p><p>weapons of war.  (DAO note:  Some MIG-29 training is in </p><p>process.  The Burmese are also reportedly negotiating with </p><p>Ukraine for air-to-air missiles though there are no confirmed </p><p>reports of deliveries as yet.) </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
