MYERS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, TC </p><p>SUBJECT: THE MONEY PIT: FISCAL IRREGULARITIES IN THE UAE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U) Classified by Charge D\'Affaires Tom Williams for reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) The UAE federal government\'s top financial control body -- the </p><p>Abu Dhabi </p><p>Audit Department -- announced publicly on February 1 that the federal </p><p>coffers had </p><p>received only USD $107,000 of the USD $9 million in fees expected to be </p><p>collected by </p><p>the federal ministries and other official departments in 2002.  The </p><p>Audit Department </p><p>noted that the Interior and Economy Ministries, in particular, failed </p><p>to collect and </p><p>transfer significant revenues from fees of government services </p><p>rendered. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) The Audit Department cited the Ministry of Economy for failing </p><p>to collect </p><p>fines from foreign companies that delayed the registration or renewal </p><p>of their </p><p>commercial licenses in violation of federal law.  The Ministry of </p><p>Interior also did </p><p>not collect fines paid for traffic violations from the individual </p><p>Traffic and Civil </p><p>Defense Departments in the northern emirates.  For its part, the </p><p>Ministry of Health </p><p>increased its fee schedule for services at some health centers in </p><p>mid-2002, but did </p><p>not collect the amended fees from patients for the latter half of the </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U) In contrast, the Audit Department noted that some departments </p><p>of </p><p>Naturalization and Residency did collect the appropriate fees in 2002, </p><p>but </p><p>"accidentally" transferred the funds to local governments instead of </p><p>the federal </p><p>government. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: Although an Audit Department official intimated that </p><p>theft and </p><p>embezzlement were suspected in some of the cases in the northern </p><p>emirates (he noted </p><p>that these cases had been referred to the Attorney-General) the fiscal </p><p>irregularities </p><p>probably owe more to the confederation\'s institutional inability to </p><p>systematically </p><p>collect and transfer revenue to the feds, rather than malfeasance.  It </p><p>is unusual for </p><p>the government to publicize such derogatory information; we can only </p><p>surmise that Abu </p><p>Dhabi, which foots the bill for the increasingly large federal budget, </p><p>would like to </p><p>see federal institutions do a better job -- however small and symbolic </p><p>-- of helping </p><p>pay their way.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Williams </p><p></p></div>
