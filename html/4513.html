While noting that Turkey\'s ongoing financial crisis made </p><p>it difficult for the government to provide assistance, Paksut </p><p>said he would consult within the MFA and with the Turkish Red </p><p>Crescent to see what might be possible.  One option would be </p><p>for the Red Crescent to provide a small amount of cash.  If, </p><p>as suggested in reftel, the international donor community is </p><p>able to come up with funds to cover transportation, Turkey </p><p>might be able to provide surplus grain.  Paksut promised to </p><p>update Embassy following his internal consultations. </p><p>Meanwhile, Embassy will raise the issue in its next meeting </p><p>with the Red Crescent. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
