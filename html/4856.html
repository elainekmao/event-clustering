<p>UNCLAS ADANA 0427 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PINS, PGOV, PHUM, TU, IZ, Press Summaries, ADANA </p><p>SUBJECT:  SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY, </p><p>          DECEMBER 23, 2002 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for </p><p>December 23, 2002.  Please note that Turkish press </p><p>reports often contain errors or exaggerations; </p><p>AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for the accuracy of </p><p>the reports summarized here. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  ANTI-WAR RALLY IN ADANA </p><p>(Evrensel/Milli Gazete/Bolge)  On December 22, nearly </p><p>500 workers, laborers and youths who were members of </p><p>the Labor Party (EMEP), the Freedom and Solidarity </p><p>Party (ODP), the TKP (Turkish Communist Party) and the </p><p>Public Training Centers, all components of the Adana </p><p>War Opponents Platform, gathered in Adana\'s Ugur Mumcu </p><p>Square to protest the December 19 decision by the </p><p>Adana Governor\'s Office to postpone until February the </p><p>proposed anti-war rally the Platform wanted to </p><p>organize on December 22.  "We do not want to become </p><p>U.S. puppets," the protestors said.  Yasin Aytac of </p><p>the Haber-Sen in Adana read a press release on behalf </p><p>of the platform characterizing the postponement as </p><p>"the throwing backward of humanitarian values."  Aytac </p><p>said he did not want the Governor\'s Office and the </p><p>Incirlik Air Base to become the center of war and the </p><p>U.S. Consulate a war representation.  Aytac added the </p><p>U.S. did not have the right to teach anyone the lesson </p><p>of human rights and democracy because none of the </p><p>Middle Eastern administrations which the U.S. </p><p>supported were democratic.  He also criticized the </p><p>U.S. stance on Israel\'s attitude toward Palestine. </p><p>"We reject a war decision by the government, which </p><p>acts like a satellite or a colonial governor of the </p><p>U.S., on our behalf," he indicated.  A similar </p><p>demonstration was held in Izmir, where hundreds of </p><p>thousands of people protested government practices </p><p>thus far and its pro-war attitude.  Turkiye reported </p><p>nearly 1,500 people, including children, attended the </p><p>anti-war rally in Adana, carrying banners and shouting </p><p>slogans that were critical of war and the U.S. </p><p>[Consulate personnel observed only 150-200 people.] </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  NINE KADEK MEMBERS ARRESTED IN MARDIN </p><p>(Turkiye)  Mardin police arrested nine KADEK (PKK) </p><p>members who admitted having come from Istanbul to </p><p>carry out KADEK activities in rural Nusaybin (Mardin). </p><p>A pistol, a cartridge clip and ten rounds of </p><p>ammunition were seized in the search of one arrestee\'s </p><p>home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  THREE SUSPECTS ORDERED HELD FOR MEMBERSHIP IN PKK </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Van State Security Court ordered three </p><p>of the six people arrested in an anti-KADEK (PKK) </p><p>operation in Van for preparing to join the PKK to </p><p>remain in custody for "membership in the </p><p>organization."  The remaining three arrestees, all </p><p>under 18 years of age, were sent to the Van Security </p><p>Directorate\'s Children\'s Department to be handed over </p><p>to their families. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  PETITION DRIVE FOR A NEW CONSTITUTION </p><p>(Evrensel)  The Adiyaman Democracy Platform launched a </p><p>"Hand in Hand for a New Constitution" petition drive, </p><p>claiming the 1982 Constitution fails to meet the needs </p><p>of the Turkish society. </p><p>HOLTZ </p><p></p></div>
