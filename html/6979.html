<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000594 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PASSES 2003 BUDGET </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) 02 Abuja 1194 </p><p>     (B) 01 Lagos 2367 </p><p>     (C) 01 Abuja 997 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Summary. On March 5, Nigeria\'s National Assembly passed </p><p>the fiscal year 2003 budget, after increasing allocations </p><p>by 28 percent with respect to the initial estimates </p><p>submitted by President Obasanjo. The legislators proposed </p><p>larger capital expenditures and more funding for the </p><p>forthcoming elections, especially the budgetary allocations </p><p>for security and the electoral commission (INEC). $1.8 </p><p>billion (naira 225 billion) was allocated to service </p><p>foreign debt. Obasanjo has merely stated that "the </p><p>government will continue to make debt service payments." </p><p>Although the President has not signed the bill, we believe </p><p>he will, if only to sustain executive-legislative comity </p><p>during the last three weeks preceding the presidential </p><p>election.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>The President\'s Budget Estimates, Targets, and Priorities </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. President Obasanjo presented the fiscal year 2003 budget </p><p>to a joint session of the National Assembly on November 19, </p><p>2002. Total budgetary expenditures were estimated at $6 </p><p>billion (naira 765.1 billion). Recurrent expenditures were </p><p>put at $4 billion (naira 508.8 billion) comprising </p><p>personnel charges ($2.7 billion - naira 343.3 billion) and </p><p>administrative charges ($1.3 billion - naira 165.4 </p><p>billion). Capital expenditures were set at $2 billion </p><p>(naira 256.4 billion). The projected federally-collectible </p><p>government revenue from crude oil was $8.8 billion (naira </p><p>1,120.2 billion), predicated on a crude oil price of $21 a </p><p>barrel and an OPEC quota of 1.7 million barrels per day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Comment.  Although these figures in the sentence </p><p>immediately above were derived from Obasanjo\'s budget </p><p>submission speech, the data do not immediately add up.  The </p><p>Presidency estimated that gross federally collectible </p><p>revenue would total $14.3 billion (1.819 trillion naira) in </p><p>2003; this is the revenue to be shared among the federal, </p><p>state, and local governments. (Reftels provide details on </p><p>Nigeria\'s revenue sharing within the federation.) Of this </p><p>$14.3 billion, the Presidency estimated that $8.8 billion </p><p>would accrue from crude oil sales.  But this figure </p><p>apparently should be $13 billion (21 x 365 x 1.7 million). </p><p>Moreover, $8.8 billion equals 62 percent of $14.3 billion </p><p>whereas the federal government\'s share of federally </p><p>collectible revenue is 46.6 percent of total revenue </p><p>collectible.  Forty-six point six percent of $14.3 equals </p><p>$6.7 billion.  The discrepancy may be simply apparent if </p><p>the difference between $8.8 billion and $6.7 billion is </p><p>funding for cash calls.  This $2.1 billion would comprise </p><p>the federal government\'s share of the costs of running the </p><p>joint venture oil operations.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. The President\'s announced macroeconomic targets included </p><p>an exchange rate of naira 126 to the U.S. dollar, real GDP </p><p>growth of 5 percent, inflation at 9 percent, unemployment </p><p>at 13 percent, and non-oil export growth at 10 percent. </p><p>Obasanjo\'s priority is infrastructure: roads, airports, </p><p>energy and water supply, telecommunications, maritime ports </p><p>and railways. His other priorities are enhancement of the </p><p>security environment, revitalization of manufacturing, and </p><p>promotion of technology, particularly information and </p><p>communications technology. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>National Assembly\'s Version of the 2003 Budget </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  More than three months after Obasanjo submitted his </p><p>2003 budget to the National Assembly, the legislators </p><p>passed their amended version of the bill.  (Nigeria\'s </p><p>fiscal year is January 1 - December 31.)  Their gross </p><p>expenditures estimate totaled $7.7 billion (naira 976.3 </p><p>billion), and comprised recurrent expenditures of $4.7 </p><p>billion (naira 594 billion) and capital expenditures of $3 </p><p>billion (naira 382.4 billion). The Assembly\'s estimate of </p><p>federally collectible government revenue totaled $19 </p><p>billion (naira 2,433.0 billion), predicated on a crude oil </p><p>price of $22 a barrel. This $19 billion comprises $16.8 </p><p>billion in oil revenue and $2.2 billion in non-oil revenue. </p><p>The national legislature\'s priorities also include </p><p>infrastructure, security, and funding for INEC.  While the </p><p>legislators would allocate $1.8 billion (naira 225 billion) </p><p>to service foreign debt, Obasanjo merely stated in his </p><p>budget submission speech that "the government will continue </p><p>to make debt service payments.  However, debt payments as a </p><p>share of government revenue will be in line with the share </p><p>of expenditures on key social amenities and services." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Why the Change In Budget Estimates? </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. On March 13, EconOff met with the Chairman of the House </p><p>of Representatives Committee on Appropriation, Jubrin </p><p>Barau. He confirmed that the National Assembly\'s changes in </p><p>expenditure estimates were based on its view that Nigeria\'s </p><p>roads, electric power, telecommunications facilities, and </p><p>water supply need to be improved in order to reduce the </p><p>cost of doing business and attract domestic and foreign </p><p>investment. This need justified, he said, larger </p><p>allocations for the Ministries of Water Resources, Power </p><p>and Steel, and Works and Housing, from $197 million (naira </p><p>25.1 billion) to $354 million (naira 45 billion), $241 </p><p>million (naira 30.6 billion) to $319 million (naira 40.6 </p><p>billion), and $307 million (naira 38.9 billion) to $464 </p><p>million (naira 59 billion), respectively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. Barau asserted that the National Assembly believes--as </p><p>does the Presidency--that enhancement of personal and </p><p>physical security should be the government\'s top priority, </p><p>especially prevention of political assassinations, in the </p><p>run-up to the April national, state, and local elections. </p><p>The Assembly, he said, allocated more funding for INEC to </p><p>ensure a hitch-free election. The allocation for the police </p><p>forces was increased from $377 million (naira 47.9 billion) </p><p>to $519 million (naira 65.9 billion), while INEC\'s was </p><p>raised from $15 million (naira 1.9 billion) to $105 million </p><p>(naira 13.4 billion). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. Barau explained that the National Assembly raised </p><p>Nigeria\'s estimated oil reference price to $22 per barrel </p><p>because the Assembly believes the price of oil will not </p><p>fall soon below $25 a barrel on the international market. </p><p>Barau opined that the time lag associated with post-war </p><p>Iraqi oil\'s reemergence on the market will keep the price </p><p>of oil above $22 per barrel for some time.  He also </p><p>asserted that OPEC will modify its quotas during the year </p><p>to ensure that the price does not fall below $25 a barrel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>Barau\'s Fears </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. Barau disclosed that he shares the public\'s pessimism </p><p>that the budget will not be properly implemented following </p><p>its enactment.  (Comment. To Barau, proper implementation </p><p>of the budget means appropriating and obligating budgetary </p><p>funds as deemed fit by the National Assembly.  Neither the </p><p>international financial institutions nor we subscribe to </p><p>this view.  Government budget planning in Nigeria is </p><p>rightly considered an academic exercise, in large part </p><p>because the state and federal legislatures have encouraged </p><p>unsustainable budgets. If Barau is pessimistic about the </p><p>proper implementation of the fiscal year 2003 budget, he </p><p>and his peers should work to ensure fiscal discipline.  End </p><p>Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>Will the President Sign the Budget? </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. Reflecting his deep cynicism, Barau said Obasanjo </p><p>should sign the budget bill as is.  Because elections are </p><p>fast approaching, he said the President should not repeat </p><p>last year\'s disagreement with the National Assembly. </p><p>Obasanjo could express his reservations later, which could </p><p>lead to re-prioritization of projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  At a press conference on March 18, Magnus Kpakol, the </p><p>President\'s Chief Economic Advisor, stated that Obasanjo </p><p>might not sign the bill before the end of March because the </p><p>National Assembly and the Presidency are trying to </p><p>harmonize their budget estimates. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. Uppermost on the President\'s mind is winning the April </p><p>2003 elections. Obasanjo will thus likely sign the 2003 </p><p>budget bill to avoid another dispute that could affect his </p><p>electoral fortunes. Another compelling reason to sign the </p><p>bill is that the budget is of little significance.  What </p><p>counts are expenditure obligations, and the President has </p><p>demonstrated, time and again, that he can keep expenditures </p><p>down when revenue falls short of expectations.  Whether he </p><p>will do this in 2003 is an open question. End Comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
