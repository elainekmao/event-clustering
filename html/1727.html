IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) SUMMARY: THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE HAS </p><p>VIGOROUSLY DISPUTED A MAY 29 ARTICLE IN THE BRITISH </p><p>"GUARDIAN" NEWSPAPER THAT STATES THAT ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>MILITARY OFFICERS ARE PLANNING A COUP AGAINST PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE.  WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CORROBORATE THE </p><p>SUBSTANCE OF THE REPORT.  THE GOZ\'S INITIAL DENIALS </p><p>RELIED EXCLUSIVELY ON COMMENTS BY SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>OFFICIALS DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE STORY, FOLLOWED </p><p>ONLY A SECOND DAY BY THE ZIMBABWEAN DEFENSE FORCE </p><p>COMMANDER AWKWARDLY DISMISSING THE REPORT.  THE </p><p>"GUARDIAN\'S" HARARE STRINGER INFORMED US THAT THE OFF- </p><p>THE-RECORD SOURCE FOR THE STORY WAS PRESIDENT THABO </p><p>MBEKI.  THE VEHEMENCE OF THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>REACTION REFLECTS THE INCREASING PARANOIA WITHIN THE </p><p>RULING PARTY FOLLOWING THE RECENT DEATHS OF TWO </p><p>MINISTERS IN CAR ACCIDENTS -- HISTORICALLY A FAVORITE </p><p>ZANU-PF METHOD OF ASSASSINATION -- AND GROWING CONCERNS </p><p>ABOUT THE LOYALTY OF THE MILITARY RANK-AND-FILE.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) AN ARTICLE WRITTEN BY HUGO YOUNG IN THE MAY 29 </p><p>EDITION OF THE "GUARDIAN" NEWSPAPER REPORTING THAT </p><p>SENIOR ZIMBABWE MILITARY OFFICERS WILL LAUNCH A COUP </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01751  01 OF 02  311430Z </p><p>AGAINST PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS STRUCK A RAW NERVE IN </p><p>HARARE.  THE ARTICLE ALLEGES THAT ZIMBABWEAN MILITARY </p><p>COMMANDERS INFORMED THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT THAT </p><p>THEY EXPECT A FOOD CRISIS LATER THIS YEAR WILL PROVE A </p><p>FLASH POINT THAT COULD RESULT IN FOOD RIOTS.  THE ARMY </p><p>WOULD BE FORCED TO INTERVENE IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICE, </p><p>BUT WOULD NOT USE FORCE AGAINST ORDINARY ZIMBABWEANS, </p><p>THE ARTICLE CONTINUES.  IF THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT ORDERS </p><p>THE MILITARY TO SHOOT, IT WOULD INSTEAD OPT TO TAKE </p><p>POWER, THE "GUARDIAN" STORY ALLEGES, AND SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT SENIOR ZIMBABWEAN MILITARY </p><p>OFFICERS ALREADY HAVE MADE PLANS TO DO SO.  THE BRITISH </p><p>NEWSPAPER CONTINUED THAT, ACCORDING TO SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>INTELLIGENCE, THE COUP LEADER WOULD BE THE COMMANDER OF </p><p>THE AIR FORCE, AIR MARSHAL PERENCE SHIRI. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) HARARE STRINGER FOR THE "GUARDIAN" NEWSPAPER, </p><p>ANDREW MELDRUM, TOLD CHARGE ON MAY 30 THAT YOUNG HAD </p><p>NONE OTHER THAN THABO MBEKI AS HIS OFF-THE-RECORD </p><p>SOURCE.  DIANE CORNER, THE BRITISH DEPUTY HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER IN HARARE, DESCRIBED YOUNG AS A LEADING </p><p>POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND, INDEED, ONE OF THE MOST </p><p>INFLUENTIAL JOURNALISTS IN BRITAIN.  SHE CONTINUED THAT </p><p>WHILE FOREIGN AFFAIRS IS NOT YOUNG\'S USUAL BEAT, THE </p><p>"GUARDIAN" FELT IT HAD TO SEND ONE OF ITS TOP PEOPLE TO </p><p>SECURE AN INTERVIEW WITH MBEKI PRIOR TO THE SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN PRESIDENT\'S VISIT TO LONDON IN JUNE.  WE HAVE </p><p>CHECKED OUT THE STORY WITH CONTACTS IN THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>MILITARY, INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>HIGH COMMISSION, BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CORROBORATE THE </p><p>SUBSTANCE OF THE REPORTS.  MOREOVER, THE MAY 30 EDITION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  01751  01 OF 02  311430Z </p><p>OF THE "GUARDIAN" GAVE PROMINENT PLAY TO STRONG DENIALS </p><p>FROM SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT THEY HAD </p><p>ANY KNOWLEDGE OF A COUP PLOT. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT HAS DENIED THIS </p><p>SPECULATIVE STORY WITH VIGOR.  GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED </p><p>RADIO, TELEVISION AND PRINT MEDIA HAVE DISMISSED THE </p><p>ALLEGATIONS WITH CONTEMPT AND QUOTED THE SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>LEADERSHIP AS DISTANCING ITSELF FROM THE STORY.  ON MAY </p><p>31 THE PRO-GOVERNMENT "HERALD" NEWSPAPER QUOTED THE </p><p>INARTICULATE AND NORMALLY RECLUSIVE DEFENSE FORCE </p><p>COMMANDER, GENERAL VITALI </p><p>S ZVINAVASHE, AS MALADROITLY </p><p>DISMISSING THE COUP PLOT REPORTS.  "IT IS NOT TRUE," THE </p><p>PAPER CITES THE GENERAL AS HAVING SAID, "BECAUSE THAT </p><p>TYPE OF THING IS NOT BEING EXPECTED IN THIS COUNTRY.  I, </p><p>AS THE COMMANDER, WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE COUP.  IT </p><p>IS NOT TRUE."  "THE HERALD" ALSO RAN A SCURRILOUS </p><p>ARTICLE IN ITS MAY 30 EDITION ALLEGING THAT THE </p><p>"GUARDIAN" PIECE WAS ANOTHER STEP IN THE BRITISH PLOT TO </p><p>DESTABILIZE AND DISCREDIT PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S GOVERNMENT. </p><p>WE NOTED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT THE "HERALD\'S" INITIAL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8893 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  01751  02 OF 02  311430Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   ACQ-00   CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00 </p><p>      DS-00    FBIE-00  VC-00    TEDE-00  INR-00   LAB-01   VCE-00 </p><p>      NSAE-00  PM-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   USIE-00  PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   NFAT-00  SAS-00     /004W </p><p>                  ------------------F2C324  311430Z /38 </p><p>O 311412Z MAY 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 9000 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PRIORITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI PRIORITY </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 001751 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SA - C.

(C) COMMENT: THE "GUARDIAN" STORY APPEARED AT A TIME </p><p>WHEN SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT ARE </p><p>FEELING MORE PARANOID THAN EVER.  IN THE SPACE OF ONE </p><p>MONTH, TWO CABINET MINISTERS HAVE.PERISHED IN CAR </p><p>ACCIDENTS, A POLITICAL ASSASSINATION METHOD THAT HAS </p><p>BEEN USED BY ZANU-PF IN THE PAST.  MANY ZIMBABWEANS WITH </p><p>WHOM WE SPEAK ASSUME THAT THE TWO MINISTERS WERE VICTIMS </p><p>OF A HIT.  THE MOST COMMON SPECULATION IS THAT 36 YEAR- </p><p>OLD YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, GENDER, AND EMPLOYMENT CREATION </p><p>MINISTER BORDER GEZI WAS KILLED BY ORDER OF THE RULING </p><p>PARTY\'S OLD GUARD, WHO BELIEVED HE HAD ACQUIRED TOO MUCH </p><p>INFLUENCE TOO QUICKLY.  IN RETURN, ACCORDING TO THIS </p><p>LINE OF SPECULATION, GEZI\'S SUPPORTERS DECIDED TO SEND A </p><p>MESSAGE BY PLANNING THE MURDER OF MAHACHI, A LEADING </p><p>MEMBER OF THE OLD GUARD.  WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE, HOWEVER, </p><p>THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE DEATHS OF THE TWO MINISTERS </p><p>WERE ANYTHING OTHER THAN TRAGIC ROAD ACCIDENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: THE GOVERNMENT\'S RABID </p><p>RESPONSE TWO DAYS RUNNING TO THE COUP STORY REVEALS ITS </p><p>VULNERABILITY AND PERCEPTION THAT IT IS UNDER SIEGE. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  01751  02 OF 02  311430Z </p><p>THE VEHEMENT DENIALS MIGHT ALSO REFLECT A CONCERN ABOUT </p><p>THE LOYALTY OF THE MILITARY\'S RANK-AND-FILE.  IN </p><p>ADDITION, THE MILITARY IS SOMETHING OF AN OFF-LIMITS </p><p>TOPIC FOR THE PRESS HERE.  IN JANUARY 1999, AFTER THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT "THE STANDARD" NEWSPAPER RAN A STORY ABOUT A </p><p>COUP PLOT, THE ARMY ABDUCTED THE NEWSPAPER\'S EDITOR AND </p><p>THE STORY\'S WRITER, HOLDING THEM INCOMMUNICADO FOR A </p><p>WEEK DURING WHICH TIME SOLDIERS TORTURED THEM.  IN MARCH </p><p>1999 POLICE ARRESTED THE PUBLISHER AND REPORTER OF "THE </p><p>MIRROR," AN OSTENSIBLY INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER, FOR A </p><p>STORY IT RAN ON A HEADLESS BODY OF SOLDIER HAVING BEEN </p><p>RETURNED FROM THE CONGO.  THE BACKLASH FROM THE HARARE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC CORPS AND WORLD PRESS FRATERNITY MADE THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HERE LOOK RIDICULOUS AND TAUGHT IT TO TREAD </p><p>LIGHTLY WITH THE SCRIBES.  RATHER THAN REMAIN IN </p><p>SECLUSION AND MOURNING FOR HIS DEAD COMRADE IN ARMS, THE </p><p>LATE DEFENSE MINISTER MOVEN MAHACHI, PRESIDENT MUGABE </p><p>BARELY BURIED THE MAN BEFORE JETTING OFF TO JAKARTA FOR </p><p>THE.G-15 MEETING, AS IF TO SHOW HIS CONTEMPT FOR THE </p><p>"GUARDIAN\'S" ACCOUNT.  WE ALSO TAKE MUGABE\'S DEPARTURE </p><p>FOR JAKARTA AS A POSITIVE SIGN: THE PRESIDENT\'S </p><p>CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS </p><p>BETTER NEWS FOR ZIMBABWE THAN HIS WITHDRAWAL INTO A </p><p>FRIGHTENED AND PARANOID COCOON HERE IN HARARE.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
