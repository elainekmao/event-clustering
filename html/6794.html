<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 TEGUCIGALPA 000753 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SECSTATE please pass USAID for CJohnson </p><p>STATE FOR OES/ETC Eskewes and FWS/DMA PThomas </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: SENV, ETRD, ECON, HO </p><p>SUBJECT: GOH PREPARATION FOR CITES II LISTING OF BIGLEAF </p><p>MAHOGANY </p><p> </p><p>REF: SECSTATE 16166 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary. The scientific authority in Honduras, made </p><p>up of both governmental and private entities, is preparing </p><p>for the Appendix II listing of Bigleaf Mahogany to the </p><p>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species </p><p>(CITES).  While Honduras does have some administrative and </p><p>legal structure already in place, it lacks the additional </p><p>technical training and funding to make their counter </p><p>trafficking efforts and overall forestry management efforts </p><p>fully successful.  Issues Honduras would like raised at the </p><p>next Mahogany Working Group include certification, </p><p>financing, information exchange, management issues and </p><p>attracting private investment for plantations.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The scientific authority in Honduras, comprised of </p><p>the Panamerican Agricultural School, the National Forestry </p><p>Science School, the National Autonomous University of </p><p>Honduras, and the National Forestry Department (COHDEFOR) </p><p>meets monthly to discuss and give technical and scientific </p><p>opinions on use of and exportation of CITES species. In </p><p>previous administrations, the meetings were strictly run by </p><p>the Honduran National Forestry Department, COHDEFOR.  The </p><p>Office of Biodiversity in the Ministry of Natural Resources, </p><p>SERNA, is currently the leading scientific authority for the </p><p>group. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) COHDEFOR is responsible for management of national </p><p>forests, the land from which the largest portion of mahogany </p><p>is harvested and exported.  COHDEFOR sells the wood by board- </p><p>feet to agro-forestry groups and private businesses.  Agro- </p><p>forestry groups and private businesses do the actual </p><p>industrial transformation; both internal commercialization </p><p>and export of industrialized products. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) COHDEFOR has provided the following answers to </p><p>specific questions raised in paragraph 4 of Secstate 16166: </p><p> </p><p>a) What is the host country outlook for implementing the </p><p>Apendix II listing? </p><p> </p><p>The AFE-COHDEFOR is creating a special action plan in order </p><p>to implement the requirements for the commerce of mahogany </p><p>in accordance with the proposed Apendix II listing in CITES </p><p>for bigleaf mahogany.  This process includes: </p><p> </p><p>-- Revision of the technical, regulatory and administrative </p><p>norms and control mechanisms in the management plan. </p><p>-- Training in a wide range of related subjects. </p><p>-- Methods of control over illegal cutting in the forests </p><p>and roadways, coordinated with the district attorney\'s </p><p>office for environmental affairs, the Attorney General\'s </p><p>office of environmental affairs, municipalities, organized </p><p>civil society, the National Police, and the army. </p><p>Additionally there is a need for controls in industrial </p><p>centers. </p><p>-- Measures to achieve a certification of forestry </p><p>management. </p><p>-- Continue the implementation of the certification program </p><p>for forestry plantations. </p><p>-- Intensify the efforts of mahogany plantations and other </p><p>valuable species on national lands, community lands and </p><p>private lands. </p><p> </p><p>Measures for the filing, collection and processing of </p><p>documents required by CITES is more problematic. </p><p> </p><p>The GOH has encountered serious difficulties in the </p><p>verification of the place of origin for mahogany, when </p><p>applications for exportation of furniture and "transformed </p><p>or semi-transformed" wood are presented. </p><p> </p><p>There are no means or mechanisms in place for export control </p><p>(beside the fact that exports of mahogany are authorized, </p><p>Honduras does not appear on the list of exporters of this </p><p>species.) </p><p> </p><p>Due to the aforementioned and other situations, the </p><p>feasibility of implementation of methods of control for the </p><p>trafficking and sale of mahogany is low without the </p><p>strengthening of the issues pointed out in the following </p><p>responses listed below in numbers 3, 4 and 5. </p><p> </p><p>b) Will implementation fit into an existing system for </p><p>sustainable management of forests and monitoring of trade? </p><p> </p><p>The implementation of CITES requirements falls under the </p><p>current system for sustainable management in accordance with </p><p>criteria and indicators already established. </p><p> </p><p>c) In what areas will the government need to build new </p><p>capacity in order to implement the listing?  Do they appear </p><p>to have the resources (financial, technical) and legislative </p><p>framework to do so? </p><p> </p><p>The Government of Honduras needs to strengthen the </p><p>systematic examination of biological information about the </p><p>wild populations and/or plantations of the species.  This </p><p>can be improved through the strengthening of the </p><p>institutions that make up the scientific authority. </p><p> </p><p>Honduras also needs to improve public awareness and </p><p>promotion of the certification of wood (environmental and </p><p>social) as well as strengthen the mechanisms of </p><p>administration of the Management Plan and control of illegal </p><p>trafficking. </p><p> </p><p>The GOH and the scientific authority realize they need to </p><p>develop a specific educational plan for: </p><p> </p><p>- Public defenders, attorney general\'s offices </p><p>- Technical advisors working on Forestry Management </p><p>- Customs Officials </p><p>- National Police Officials </p><p>- Organized Agro-Forestry groups </p><p>- Private Companies: Forest owners, lumberjacks, wood </p><p>     processors / finishers, exporters </p><p>- Administrative authorities </p><p> </p><p>A national norm pertaining to the implementation of CITES </p><p>(i.e. adaptation of the existing technical norms agreed to </p><p>in the CITES) needs to be created. </p><p> </p><p>The legal instruments at the national level for the </p><p>implementation of CITES is the CITES convention itself which </p><p>Honduras has ratified.  Honduras also has forestry and </p><p>environmental laws which provide institutions with clear </p><p>legal mandates for the implementation of CITES. </p><p> </p><p>The technical capacity for the implementation of CITES </p><p>exists both within and outside of Government agencies, but </p><p>it requires up-to-date training. There is a lack of </p><p>technical training of the management and use of plantations </p><p>and natural forests for peasant groups involved in the </p><p>exploitation of colored wood (such as mahogany) and the </p><p>industrial or institutional technicians who act in </p><p>compliance with scientific and administrative authorities. </p><p> </p><p>There is a lack of financial resources to carry out studies </p><p>of wild populations (inventories, distribution, etc.)  There </p><p>need to be more public awareness campaigns at a national </p><p>level. </p><p> </p><p>d) What specific issues would the host government like to </p><p>see addressed at the meeting of the Mahogany Working Group? </p><p> </p><p>Themes the GOH would like to discuss in the Mahogany working </p><p>group are: </p><p> </p><p>-- Certification of forestry management and forestry </p><p>products </p><p> </p><p>-- Financing for certain aspects of trafficking control, </p><p>such as identification guides for CITES species of wood (for </p><p>customs officials). </p><p> </p><p>-- Exchange of experiences and information between countries </p><p>who have common interests (countries that share natural </p><p>distribution of mahogany) </p><p> </p><p>-- Management and protection projects for natural forests. </p><p> </p><p>-- Programs for the attraction of private investment for </p><p>plantations </p><p> </p><p>PALMER </p><p></p></div>
