<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 COLOMBO 001828 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NOFORN </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR SA, SA/INS, S/CT </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR E. MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  DECL:  10-01-12 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINS, PINR, PREL, CE, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT:  LTTE Update:  Tigers reportedly have success </p><p>in recruiting; Divisions in the LTTE re peace process? </p><p> </p><p>Refs:  (A) Colombo 1815 </p><p> </p><p>-      (B) Colombo 1299, and previous </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by W. Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of </p><p>Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) This update of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam </p><p>(LTTE) activities reviews the following: </p><p> </p><p>-- Tigers reportedly having success recruiting </p><p> </p><p>-- Divisions in the LTTE regarding the peace process?? </p><p> </p><p>-- LTTE spokesman Balasingham said to be "obsessed" with </p><p>the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>-- In a first, Tigers publish a newspaper in Sinhala, </p><p>the language of the majority community </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>Reported Success in Recruiting </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The LTTE seems to be having some success in </p><p>recruiting.  According to various contacts, the LTTE may </p><p>have added several hundred new cadre since the peace </p><p>process started in December 2001.  (Note:  The LTTE is </p><p>variously estimated to have approximately 8,000-12,000 </p><p>personnel.)  Jehan Perera, the head of a local think- </p><p>tank, told us that he had heard that the LTTE was urging </p><p>Tamils to join by asserting that "we have won the war, </p><p>and now need supporters to help administer the north and </p><p>east."  Perera said this type of pitch was reportedly </p><p>effective, especially in Jaffna District, where </p><p>government security forces have eased their long- </p><p>standing clampdown, allowing the LTTE to emerge from the </p><p>shadows. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) In addition to its calibrated pitch, the LTTE\'s </p><p>recruiting drive seems quite sophisticated and </p><p>extensive.  Tamil politicians report that trained LTTE </p><p>recruitment teams have spread out across the north and </p><p>the east.  The teams show videos of past LTTE </p><p>military/terrorist exploits, hand out pamphlets, and </p><p>then try to sign up volunteers on the spot.  To stay on </p><p>cue, the teams are given prepared answers to possible </p><p>questions from event attendees.  (Note:  While the </p><p>recruitment drive events are intensive, G. Ponnambalam, </p><p>a senior Tamil National Alliance MP, told us that they </p><p>are much more low-key than the pro-LTTE "Pongu Tamil" </p><p>festivals held earlier this year.  These events involved </p><p>mammoth crowds surrounded by large posters of LTTE </p><p>leader V. Prabhakaran and included ritualistic pledges </p><p>in support of LTTE goals.) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Comment:  With the peace process moving at full </p><p>tilt, the LTTE is apparently searching for a different </p><p>type of recruit.  In the past, the vast majority of the </p><p>recruits were earmarked to join the LTTE\'s military </p><p>wing.  Contacts report, however, that the LTTE\'s new </p><p>focus is on recruiting for political and administrative </p><p>positions in the expectation that the LTTE will soon be </p><p>in the de facto position of governing the north and </p><p>east.  This is not to say that military recruitment is </p><p>not going on:  LTTE Trincomalee military chief Paduman </p><p>recently officiated at a widely publicized "graduation </p><p>ceremony" for about a hundred armed "cadets."  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Divisions re Peace Process? </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S/NF) Tentative reports are emerging of divisions </p><p>in the LTTE regarding the direction of the peace </p><p>process.  Milinda Moragoda, a key Sri Lankan government </p><p>official involved in peace process issues (Amcit--pls </p><p>protect), told us that the GSL had intercepted LTTE </p><p>communications indicating that there was some dissonance </p><p>toward LTTE spokesman Anton Balasingham\'s management of </p><p>the peace process.  While it was not clear, Moragoda </p><p>continued, the feeling among some in the LTTE (NFI) was </p><p>that Balasingham was taking too soft a line toward the </p><p>GSL. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (S/NF) Meanwhile, other contacts report that </p><p>regional tensions in the LTTE remain a factor, with </p><p>leaders in the east (Karuna, Karikalan) more hard-line </p><p>than most of the leadership in the north.  That said, </p><p>there are reports of hard-liners in the north, too: </p><p>Ponnambalam told polchief that Colonel Banu, a high- </p><p>level military official based at LTTE headquarters in </p><p>Kilinochchi, was known to be quite apprehensive about </p><p>the peace process and what he saw as its negative effect </p><p>on the LTTE\'s military preparedness. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (S/NF) Comment:  Little is known about the nature of </p><p>the LTTE decision-making process, except that </p><p>Prabhakaran seems firmly in charge.  Thus, the real </p><p>issue is who has influence on Prabhakaran.  What we are </p><p>hearing is a bit fuzzy, but it potentially may indicate </p><p>that a hard-line, irreconcilable element may be trying </p><p>to marginalize Balasingham in order to slow down the </p><p>peace process.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>Balasingham said to be "Obsessed" with the U.S. </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Despite the lack of direct contact, the LTTE </p><p>seems to maintain a deep interest in the U.S.  Based on </p><p>his recent meetings with Balasingham at the September </p><p>peace talks in Thailand, Milinda Moragoda reported that </p><p>the Tiger spokesman peppered him with questions on where </p><p>the U.S. stands with regard to the conflict.  Moragoda\'s </p><p>impression was that Balasingham was "obsessed" on the </p><p>subject.  In one conversation, for example, when </p><p>Moragoda noted that he was going to the U.S. after the </p><p>conclusion of the talks, Balasingham sniffed, "What for? </p><p>To buy arms?"  Moragoda said he had jokingly replied </p><p>that he had done that during his last visit. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Comment:  In comments tending to back up </p><p>Moragoda\'s report, we have heard from other contacts </p><p>that the LTTE is very worried about the stance of the </p><p>U.S. toward the group.  This concern seems to have </p><p>spiked in the aftermath of September 11 and continued on </p><p>from that date.  At the heart of the LTTE\'s interest </p><p>seems to be a nagging fear that the U.S. may one day </p><p>directly confront the LTTE.  Many Sri Lankans, including </p><p>Moragoda, believe that this concern about the U.S. and </p><p>its reaction is one of the factors driving the LTTE\'s </p><p>continued involvement in the peace process.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>LTTE Publishes in Sinhala </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) For the first time in its history, the LTTE </p><p>has published a paper in Sinhala, the language of Sri </p><p>Lanka\'s majority Sinhalese community.  The first edition </p><p>of "Dedunna" ("Rainbow") was published in September. </p><p>The paper is a weekly and is published in Kilinochchi. </p><p>It is not clear how many copies of the paper the LTTE is </p><p>distributing.  It seems to be free and is of relatively </p><p>high quality with colored photos. </p><p>11.  (C) Comment:  In publishing the paper, the LTTE </p><p>seems to be making an effort to reach out and explain </p><p>its positions to the Sinhalese south.  For many years, </p><p>the LTTE has been active in publishing with front </p><p>organizations putting out Tamil- and English-language </p><p>periodicals.  Of late, websites have also been </p><p>established.  The LTTE has never published in Sinhala, </p><p>however.  If the first edition is anything to go by, it </p><p>is doubtful that the weekly will go over that well in </p><p>the south:  its huge photo of Prabhakaran will probably </p><p>not be a big draw, nor will photos of children in </p><p>uniforms dancing under the sinister, North Korea-like </p><p>slogan "peace through freedom."  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>12. (U) Minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
