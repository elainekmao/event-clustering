<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001448 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>TREASURY FOR AKIFYAT </p><p>DOC FOR JFERNANDEZ, ASTERN </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 08/06/12 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PREL, ETRD, CE, ECONOMICS </p><p>SUBJECT:  ECONOMIC REFORMS </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Colombo 561 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Summary: In its eight months in power, Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>UNF government has made measurable progress on one of its </p><p>main goals, economic reform, with efforts starting to show </p><p>real results over a broad range of promised actions.  The </p><p>true tests will be action on pending economic legislation </p><p>and implementation of difficult measures.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>THE MEANS </p><p>--------- </p><p>2. (U) To spark growth and rein in the deficit, the UNF\'s </p><p>March 2002 budget incorporated tax reforms, realignment of </p><p>investment incentives, privatization, removal of subsidies, </p><p>deregulation, and pension and labor reforms (reftel).  New </p><p>laws are required for many proposed measures, and economic- </p><p>related drafts comprise the majority of the thirty-six new </p><p>bills on the docket for an extended August/September </p><p>parliamentary session.  Parliament will consider laws or </p><p>amendments on fiscal responsibility, revenue authority, bank </p><p>rescue, IPR, financial sector revamping, the monetary law, </p><p>the electricity act, and pension supervision, among others. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U) To carry out economic reform measures, the </p><p>government is using a variety of tactics.  Leading the </p><p>effort is the Policy Development and Implementation </p><p>Ministry, a small group headed by the Prime Minister, that </p><p>operates largely behind the scenes with personnel brought in </p><p>from UNF\'s previous administrations and foreign (including </p><p>US) advisors.  Also, experienced Sri Lankans have been lured </p><p>back from abroad to take key governmental positions.  After </p><p>conferences on two major issues, deregulation and financial </p><p>sector reform, public/private sector working groups were </p><p>established to advise on implementation.  In some cases, </p><p>consultations are held with involved parties, e.g., the </p><p>Minister of Employment and Labor met regularly with </p><p>employers, unions and government officials before drafting </p><p>wide reaching reform legislation.  The government has also </p><p>contracted world class marketing firms for a public </p><p>information campaign to sell its most controversial (e.g., </p><p>privatization and tax) measures. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>TO THESE ENDS </p><p>------------- </p><p>4.  (U) The GSL has already implemented promised changes in </p><p>many areas.  It has made upward adjustments of utility, </p><p>transport, wheat flour and fuel prices, eliminating </p><p>subsidies.  One hundred percent foreign ownership is now </p><p>allowed in sectors formerly restricted, including banking, </p><p>insurance, finance, and supply of water, mass transport, </p><p>telecom and professional services.  Long term debt </p><p>instruments have been added, increasing the maximum term </p><p>treasury bonds from 6 years to 12 years.  Incentives offered </p><p>to investors under the Board of Investment were restructured </p><p>and reduced.  Civil service recruitment is frozen. </p><p>Licensing controls on rice, potatoes and onions were </p><p>removed, leaving these food items with only a duty. </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Privatization: Real progress has been made in </p><p>privatization of state-owned enterprises.  The government is </p><p>moving to reach its goal of Rps. 21 billion (approx. $219 </p><p>million) in privatization proceeds by year\'s end.  The </p><p>largest privatization this year was the sale of Lanka Marine </p><p>Services, the bunkering arm of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, </p><p>for Rs. 1.2 billion (approx. $12.5 million).  The government </p><p>has sold the residual stakes of two regional plantation </p><p>companies through the Colombo Stock Exchange.  Two sugar </p><p>mills were sold to local investors, and a Cabinet decision </p><p>is pending on a third.  The results of a tender to privatize </p><p>50 percent of the bus transport system are expected in early </p><p>September.  The GSL has announced the sale of two insurance </p><p>companies, including Sri Lanka Insurance Company, the </p><p>largest player in the market.  There are plans to sell an </p><p>additional 15 percent of Sri Lanka Telecom (out of the 65 </p><p>percent still government-held) in October.  The GSL\'s 49 </p><p>percent equity in Shell Gas Lanka will also be sold later </p><p>this year. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Tax reforms: Major tax reform was implemented with </p><p>the introduction of a Value Added Tax (VAT) on August 1. </p><p>The VAT replaces the GST of 12.5 percent and the National </p><p>Security Levy of 6.5 percent, and is expected to simplify </p><p>the tax system and improve tax administration.  Local </p><p>wholesale and retail activities, and exports are exempt from </p><p>VAT.  The VAT has reduced the number of exemptions under the </p><p>former system, expanding its regime, but a significant </p><p>portion of private consumption is still protected.  In </p><p>addition to VAT, the GSL introduced a 0.1 percent tax on </p><p>bank debits, and a 10 percent tax on interest.  The import </p><p>duty surcharge was reduced from 40 to 20 percent, a 25 </p><p>percent customs fee was lifted, and the one percent stamp </p><p>duty was eliminated.  The cost to the government of VAT </p><p>exemptions was recently estimated at Rps. 800 million ($8.33 </p><p>million).  The revenue from the tax on interest payments, </p><p>however is expected to net Rs. 5.7 billion ($59.4 million) </p><p>more than forecast. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) International Financing Institutions\' support for the </p><p>government\'s reforms efforts is strong.  The ADB and World </p><p>Bank have programs in Central Bank restructuring, legal and </p><p>judicial reforms, economic reforms technical assistance, and </p><p>public sector resources management.  USAID-funded </p><p>consultants are providing assistance in the public </p><p>information campaign, and in economic and productivity </p><p>policy development.  Support is also seen from local firms, </p><p>who are beginning to upgrade and expand, after a period of </p><p>subdued activity preceding and following the December </p><p>elections. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) Comment: The way forward for the GSL is clear, but </p><p>will not be smooth.  The government has already felt </p><p>compelled to respond to public complaints about the rising </p><p>cost of living associated with the removal of subsidies, by </p><p>lifting a cost-recovery charge on fuel.  The hinted-at </p><p>restructuring of a state-owned bank has provoked protests </p><p>from unions, as have some privatization plans.  If the GSL </p><p>does follow through on these plans, and the proposed labor </p><p>reforms, a stronger social safety net to help those </p><p>displaced by these measures must be in place. </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Comment continued: Political will to carry through </p><p>reforms seems firm at the top, and is the key reason for </p><p>results achieved so far.  US support for continued strong </p><p>leadership on economic reforms could strengthen the GSL\'s </p><p>resolve.  Lack of technical expertise, a bloated and </p><p>inefficient public sector and the entrenched culture of </p><p>delays, opacity and personal agendas hinder the efforts in </p><p>implementation.  More importantly, a derailment of the peace </p><p>process or political disruption caused by infighting in the </p><p>government could stop the momentum.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Wills </p><p></p></div>
