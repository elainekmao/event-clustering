(C) BOTH THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED AND INDEPENDENT </p><p>PRESS REPORTED IN THEIR MARCH 5 EDITIONS THAT ON MARCH </p><p>4, GLORIA OLDS, A 72-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WHITE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMER, WAS KILLED AMBUSH STYLE AS SHE WAS APPROACHING </p><p>THE SECURITY GATE TO HER FARM, LOCATED NEAR THE TOWN OF </p><p>NYAMANDLOVU, ABOUT ONE HOUR BY ROAD NORTHWEST OF </p><p>BULAWAYO.  THE PRESS REPORTS SPECULATED THAT OLDS WAS </p><p>KILLED AT 6:30 A.M., SINCE THIS IS WHEN SHE REGULARLY </p><p>OPENED THE SECURITY GATES TO HER FARM.  HER BODY WAS </p><p>DISCOVERED BY HER SON DAVID, WHO WENT TO THE FARM AT 9 </p><p>A.M., AFTER FAILING TO REACH HIS MOTHER BY PHONE. </p><p>GLORIA OLDS WAS THE MOTHER OF COMMERCIAL FARMER MARTIN </p><p>OLDS, WHO WAS KILLED ON HIS FARM BY "WAR VETS" LAST </p><p>APRIL 18, ZIMBABWE\'S INDEPENDENCE DAY.  A PICK-UP TRUCK </p><p>BELONGING TO GLORIA OLDS WAS TAKEN BY THE ASSASSINS </p><p>AFTER SHE WAS KILLED, LEADING THE POLICE TO SPECULATE </p><p>THAT ROBBERY WAS THE MOTIVE BEHIND HER KILLING. </p><p>HOWEVER, COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) OFFICIALS </p><p>DISPUTE THIS THEORY, STATING THAT MONEY AND OTHER </p><p>VALUABLES WERE NOT TAKEN FROM GLORIA OLDS\' FARMHOUSE, </p><p>EVEN THOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY ENTERED THE </p><p>FARMHOUSE TO GET THE KEYS TO THE PICK-UP. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>KILLING WAS A COLD-BLOODED AMBUSH </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) ON MARCH 5, ECONOFF SPOKE WITH MAC CRAWFORD, </p><p>PRESIDENT OF THE MATABELELAND REGION OF THE CFU, </p><p>REGARDING THE KILLING OF GLORIA OLDS (OLDS\' FARM IS </p><p>LOCATED IN MATABELELAND NORTH.)  CRAWFORD STATED THAT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00919  01 OF 03  051615Z </p><p>THE KILLING OF OLDS WAS AN AMBUSH-STYLE ASSASSINATION, </p><p>SIMILAR TO THAT OF ANOTHER WHITE FARMER, HENRY ELSWORTH </p><p>(REFS C AND D), LAST DECEMBER.  ACCORDING TO CRAWFORD, </p><p>OLDS WOULD GO OUT AND OPEN THE SECURITY GATE TO HER FARM </p><p>EACH DAY AT 6:30 A.M.  THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AT THE </p><p>SCENE OF THE KILLING INDICATES THAT OLDS WAS ABOUT A </p><p>METER FROM THE GATE, WHEN SHE WAS FIRST SHOT.  SHE THEN </p><p>TURNED, BLEEDING, IN AN ATTEMPT TO RETURN TO HER </p><p>FARMHOUSE.  SHE WAS THEN SHOT AGAIN.  THE ASSAILANTS </p><p>THEN SHOT THE LOCK OFF THE SECURITY GATE, SHOT THREE OF </p><p>OLDS\' DOGS, AND THEN APPROACHED OLDS\' BODY.  HOVERING </p><p>OVER HER, THEY SHOT HER A FEW MORE TIMES AT CLOSE RANGE. </p><p>CRAWFORD SAID THAT FIFTEEN SPENT BLACK AND GOLD </p><p>CARTRIDGES FROM AK-47 RIFLES WERE FOUND AT THE SCENE OF </p><p>%GEUNKQIQTHE CRIME, INDICATING THAT AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT </p><p>WEAPONS MAY HAVE BEEN USED.  CRAWFORD ADDED THAT THE </p><p>CARTRIDGES WERE NEW, AS IF THEY HAD JUST COME OUT OF AN </p><p>ARMORY.  WHEN ECONOFF ASKED HOW HE WAS SURE THAT THE </p><p>WEAPONS USED WERE AK-47S, AND THAT THE CARTRIDGES WERE </p><p>FROM TWO GUNS AND WERE NEW, CRAWFORD STATED THAT HE HAD </p><p>BEEN IN THE MILITARY, AND HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH SUCH </p><p>WEAPONRY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ROBBERY: A POSSIBLE MOTIVE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2669 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00919  02 OF 03  051619Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  BBG-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------CDCC4A  051619Z /38 </p><p>P 051606Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8355 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000919 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/11 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, EAGR, PGOV, EAID, PINR, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00919  02 OF 03  051619Z </p><p>SUBJECT: SEVENTY-TWO YEAR OLD FEMALE COMMERCIAL FARMER </p><p>KILLED AMBUSH STYLE IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CRAWFORD DISPUTES THE POLICE THEORY THAT OLDS\' </p><p>KILLING WAS THE RESULT OF A ROBBERY.  WHILE HER TOYOTA </p><p>HILUX 4X4 WAS TAKEN BY THE KILLERS, THEY DID NOT STEAL </p><p>OTHER VALUABLES FROM THE FARMHOUSE.  THE KILLERS ENTERED </p><p>OLDS\' FARMHOUSE, AND TOOK HER PURSE CONTAINING THE PICK- </p><p>UP KEYS, AS WELL AS SOME CHILDRENS\' CLOTHES FROM A </p><p>CLOSET.  HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT TAKE A PILE OF CASH THAT </p><p>WAS SITTING ON THE KITCHEN TABLE, MADE NO EFFORT TO OPEN </p><p>A SAFE THAT HAD THE KEYS IN THE DOOR, TOOK NONE OF THE </p><p>WEAPONS THAT OLDS KEPT IN HER BEDROOM, OR APPARENTLY ANY </p><p>OTHER VALUABLES.  WHEN ASKED WHAT OTHER MOTIVE THERE </p><p>MIGHT BE FOR HER KILLING, CRAWFORD STATED THAT OLDS WAS </p><p>IN THE PROCESS OF EVICTING A FEMALE SHOPKEEPER WHO </p><p>FAILED TO PAY RENT FROM A BUILDING SHE OWNED.  THE </p><p>SHOPKEEPER\'S HUSBAND IS A FORMER ZIMBABWE PEOPLES </p><p>REVOLUTIONARY ARMY (ZIPRA) FIGHTER FROM THE INDEPENDENCE </p><p>STRUGGLE.  THERE HAD RECENTLY BEEN A DEMONSTRATION IN </p><p>NYMANDLOVU BY THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION GROUP (AAG), A </p><p>PRO-ZANU-PF CIVIL SOCIETY GROUP THAT ARGUES FOR GEATER </p><p>BLACK OWNERSHIP OF COMPANIES, DIRECTED AGANST OLDS </p><p>BECAUSE OF THE SHOPKEEPER\'S PLIGHT.  HOEVER, CRAWFORD </p><p>DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS SITUATIO WOULD HAVE LED </p><p>ANYONE TO BRUTALLY GUN DOWN MRS.OLDS IN COLD BLOOD AT </p><p>HER FARM. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>OR: INTIMIDATION </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00919  02 OF 03  051619Z </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C)CRAWFORD SPECULATED THAT GLORIA OLDS WAS KILLED </p><p>O SEND A SIGNAL TO THE WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMING </p><p>CMMUNITY.  HE BELIEVED THAT THE MURDER OF A 72-YEAROLD </p><p>FEMALE WIDOW WAS MEANT TO SHOW THAT EVEN ELDRLY OR </p><p>FEMALE FARMERS ARE NOT SAFE ON THEIR FARC.  CRAWFORD </p><p>ALSO BELIEVED THAT OLDS WAS SINGLED UT FOR </p><p>ASSASSINATION BECAUSE SHE WAS THE MOTHER O MARTIN OLDS. </p><p>HER KILLING WOULD RE-IGNITE IN THEMINDS OF WHITE </p><p>FARMERS THE KILLINGS AND VIOLENCETHAT PREVAILED IN THE </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION PEROD.  CRAWFORD LINKED THIS </p><p>KILLING TO THE UPCOMIN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT PRESS-TOUTE DIVISIONS WITHIN THE CFU (REFS A </p><p>AND B). </p><p> </p><p>6. C) ZANU-PF HAS BEGUN A CAMPAIGN BY "WAR VETS" IN </p><p>MATABELELAND, A STRONGHOLD OF THE OPPOSITION MOVEMNT </p><p>FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC), TO INTIMIDATE MD </p><p>SUPPORTERS.  AS PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN, A GROUP O 15 TO </p><p>20 "WAR VETS" HAS BEEN GOING RECENTLY FRO FARM TO FARM </p><p>BEATING UP FARM WORKERS AND THREATNING FARMERS SO THAT </p><p>THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THE MDC IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION.  CRAWFORD ADDED THAT THE MATABELELAND REGION </p><p>OF THE CFU WAS ONE OF THE MOST UNITED REGIONS IN ITS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR THE CFU EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP AND ITS </p><p>STRATEGY OF CHALLENGING THE GOZ "FAST-TRACK" </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM THOUGH THE COURTS.  AT THE RECENT </p><p>CFU COUNCIL MEETING IN HARARE, CRAWFORD REVEALED THAT IT </p><p>WAS THE MATABELELAND REGION OF THE CFU THAT UNITED THE </p><p>COUNCIL BEHIND THE EMBATTLED CFU EXECUTIVE, AND WARDED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00919  02 OF 03  051619Z </p><p>OFF THE CHALLENGE OF NICK SWANEPOEL AND OTHER RENEGADE </p><p>CFU MEMBERS (REF A).  CRAWFORD WAS ADAMANT THAT IT IS </p><p>FOR THESE REASONS, AND NOT A SIMPLE ROBBERY, THAT GLORIA </p><p>OLDS WAS BRUTALLY KILLED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) WE ARE VERY SKEPTICAL THAT GLORIA OLDS WAS KILLED </p><p>IN THE COURSE OF A ROBBERY.  ONE DOES NOT NEED TO SHOOT </p><p>A 72-YEAR-OLD UNARMED GRANDMOTHER MULTIPLE TIMES WITH </p><p>AUTOMATIC RIFLES IN ORDER TO TAKE HER VEHICLE.  WE </p><p>SIMILARLY DOUBT THAT SHE WAS MURDERED AS A RESULT OF THE </p><p>COURT PROCEEDING TO EVICT THE SHOPKEEPER FROM A BUILDING </p><p>SHE OWNED.  WHAT WE DO FIND CREDIBLE IS THAT SHE WAS </p><p>KILLED, IN A BRUTAL AND COLD-BLOODED MANNER, IN ORDER TO </p><p>SOW FURTHER FEAR IN THE WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMING </p><p>COMMUNITY.  THIS COULD INCLUDE THE GOAL OF CAUSING MORE </p><p>FARMERS TO ABANDON THEIR FARMS AND LEAVE ZIMBABWE OUT OF </p><p>FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES AND FAMILY\'S SAFETY.  IT COULD ALSO </p><p>AIM TO CREATE FURTHER DIVIDES IN THE CFU, LEADING TO ITS </p><p>ULTIMATE BREAK-UP.  ONE THING THAT WE ARE FAIRLY SURE OF </p><p>IS THAT THIS KILLING WILL JOIN THE LIST OF THE OTHER SIX </p><p>MURDERED WHITE COMMERCIAL FARMERS WHOSE KILLERS HAVE </p><p>NEVER BEEN APPREHENDED OR PROSECUTED SINCE THE FARM </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ2641 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00919  03 OF 03  051616Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  INL-00   DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EB-00    EUR-00   FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00 </p><p>      ACE-00   P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  BBG-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /010W </p><p>                  ------------------CDCB97  051616Z /38 </p><p>P 051606Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 8356 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000919 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/11 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, EAGR, PGOV, EAID, PINR, ZI </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00919  03 OF 03  051616Z </p><p>SUBJECT: SEVENTY-TWO YEAR OLD FEMALE COMMERCIAL FARMER </p><p>KILLED AMBUSH STYLE IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>VIOLENCE BEGAN IN FEBRUARY 2000.
