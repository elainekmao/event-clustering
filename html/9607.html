<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001478 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PDPA FOR DALTON, MITCHELL AND SIMS </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH\'S VISIT TO AFRICAL; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "U. S. crop subsidies disadvantage </p><p>      African farmers" the July 20 edition of the </p><p>      government-controlled Bulawayo-based weekly "Sunday </p><p>      News" carried the following article by Mbongeni </p><p>      Mguni, in which he criticizes President George W. </p><p>      Bush for dodging the issue of crop subsidies during </p><p>      his visit to Africa, charging that the current </p><p>      system of crop subsidies portray "a racist agenda by </p><p>      the Republican regime to entrench agricultural </p><p>      hegemony over Africa."  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   "President George W. Bush of the United States, whose </p><p>      country has stubbornly refused to scrap the trillion-dollar </p><p>      crop subsidies for U. S. farmers that disadvantage African </p><p>      farmers, remained mum on the controversial issue during his </p><p>      just-ended whirlwind tour of the continent.  This has </p><p>      thrown a damper on export farming in Africa. . .With </p><p>      federal government backing, farmers in America are able to </p><p>      under-price their crop exports, cutting deeply into export </p><p>      markets, where African farmers are struggling to gain a </p><p>      foothold. . .Cotton, coffee, wheat and other cash crop </p><p>      farmers in southern Africa were hoping that Mr. Bush would </p><p>      use his African safari to announce a downward review of </p><p>      subsidies to farmers in America.  However, the American </p><p>      President neatly skirted the issue of crop subsidies, </p><p>      focusing his energies on persuading African farmers and </p><p>      governments to import genetically modified crop products </p><p>      and allow the wide-scale use of biotechnology in </p><p>      agriculture. . .Other international groups, mostly based in </p><p>      America, believe the system of crop subsidies is part of a </p><p>      racist agenda by the Republican regime to entrench </p><p>      agricultural hegemony over Africa. . . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
