He said the next key </p><p>steps for restoring confidence are structural reform, and he </p><p>believes that an IMF program with significant structural </p><p>reform commitments would generate political opposition and be </p><p>counter-productive.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) In a June 3 meeting with IMF Resident </p><p>Representative Rogerio Zandamela, econoff asked whether </p><p>Brazil\'s IMF program would be renewed when it expires at the </p><p>end of the year.  (Note:  When an IMF mission visited Brazil </p><p>in early May for the third review, a local paper carried a </p><p>story that the GOB had already decided not to renew the </p><p>program, which was quickly denied by the Ministry of Finance. </p><p> Later, when Anne Krueger, the IMF\'s First Deputy Managing </p><p>Director, visited Brazil on May 19-20, she told the media </p><p>that the question of renewing the agreement had not been </p><p>discussed with the GOB.) </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Zandamela said the there had been internal IMF </p><p>discussions about a follow-on program during the May 19-20 </p><p>visit.  Anoop Singh, Director of the IMF\'s Western Hemisphere </p><p>Department, had accompanied Krueger and had been interested </p><p>in exploring another IMF program.  However, according to </p><p>Zandamela, Krueger\'s initial reaction was negative.  Krueger </p><p>evidently said that the IMF should declare its current </p><p>program a success and when it is over, step to the side and </p><p>be available to help when and if necessary. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Econoff asked if the GOB had the resources to repay </p><p>its current IMF obligations without a new IMF agreement, and </p><p>how the market would react if there were no IMF program. </p><p>Zandamela said that gross reserves are high enough that </p><p>Brazil could repay its obligations and still have a cushion, </p><p>particularly if the GOB continues to issue bonds in the </p><p>international market.  (Note:  Gross reserves were $43.3 </p><p>billion as of June 6, while net reserves (minus IMF funding) </p><p>are approximately $17.0 billion.) </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Regarding the private sector reaction, Zandamela said </p><p>that he is not concerned.  He continued that the key next </p><p>step for the government is implementing its reform program </p><p>(notably tax and pension reform, but also Central Bank </p><p>autonomy and bankruptcy law reform).  Featuring structural </p><p>reform in an IMF program would be difficult and maybe </p><p>counter-productive, he said.  The administration cannot </p><p>guarantee that congress will act on its reform proposals, and </p><p>an IMF program conditioned on congressional action would </p><p>probably generate political resistance in congress. </p><p>(Typically, in Brazil\'s IMF programs, the administration </p><p>commits to present legislation to congress but is silent on </p><p>the question of approval.)  Therefore Zandamela has his </p><p>doubts as to what a notional next IMF program should look </p><p>like. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Econoff asked whether the IMF would consider a </p><p>monitoring program in the absence of a formal stand-by </p><p>arrangement.  Zandamela said that he doubts the GOB would </p><p>submit itself to a special review regime without the </p><p>financial support of a regular program, given that the IMF </p><p>missions are very time-consuming for the GOB.  He added, </p><p>though, that even without an IMF program, the Fund would </p><p>undertake twice-yearly reviews, compared to four times a year </p><p>under a stand-by program. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Zandamela cautioned that it is too soon to talk about </p><p>a "virtuous circle."  However, he added that by the end of </p><p>the year the government\'s economic policies, combined with </p><p>falling inflation, may open the way for a cycle of growing </p><p>confidence, falling inflation, lower interest rates, </p><p>accelerating economic growth, and reasonable capital inflows. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Comment.  It\'s a bit early to make any judgment on </p><p>whether Brazil should renew its IMF program at the end of the </p><p>year, but Krueger\'s and Zandamela\'s comments provide a useful </p><p>perspective on why a program may not be necessary.  In </p><p>general, Zandamela is on target in his assessment that </p><p>Brazil\'s economic success depends far more on GOB action </p><p>rather than an IMF program.  However, we are less sanguine </p><p>than Zandamela about market confidence in the absence of an </p><p>IMF program, since a program would provide a buffer against </p><p>balance of payment pressure as well as valuable benchmarks to </p><p>measure the government\'s macroeconomic effort. </p><p> </p><p>Hrinak </p><p></p></div>
