<p>UNCLAS KATHMANDU 000080 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SA/INS FOR EKPUK </p><p>LONDON FOR POL - REIDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, SOCI, NP </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPAL COMPARES FAVORABLY IN CORRUPTION SURVEY </p><p> </p><p>REF: 2002 KATHMANDU 2467 </p><p> </p><p>1. In December 2002, Transparency International-Bangladesh </p><p>(TIB) completed a citizen survey of five South Asian </p><p>countries on the incidence of corruption in accessing and </p><p>using government services in education, health, power, land </p><p>administration, taxation, police, and the judiciary.  In </p><p>almost all categories, Nepalis reported relatively low levels </p><p>of corruption compared with those of their neighbors.  In </p><p>fact, reports in most categories rate corruption in </p><p>government services one-third to one-half of Nepal\'s South </p><p>Asian neighbors. </p><p> </p><p>2. The survey reported the incidence of corruption for: </p><p>-- Education at 25 percent (the lowest in the region); </p><p>-- Health Services at 18 percent (the second lowest, behind </p><p>India); </p><p>-- Power at 12 percent (the lowest in the region); </p><p>-- Land Administration at 17 percent (the lowest in the </p><p>region); </p><p>-- Tax Administration at 25 percent (the second lowest in the </p><p>region, behind India); </p><p>-- Police Services at 48 percent (the lowest in the region); </p><p>and </p><p>-- Judiciary at 42 percent (the lowest in the region). </p><p> </p><p>3. The survey does not give Nepal a clean slate and, in fact, </p><p>finds that requested bribes are exceptionally high--USD 180 </p><p>for health services and USD 160 for tax administration--when </p><p>compared with Nepal\'s per capita GDP of USD 220.  The survey </p><p>also asked respondents to rank the the government\'s services </p><p>according to their perception of corrupt practices.  Nepalis </p><p>rated the police as the most corrupt, followed by the </p><p>judiciary, with education and tax administration tying for </p><p>third. </p><p> </p><p>4. Comment. Virtually all analyses of the Maoist insurgency </p><p>in Nepal rank governmental corruption high as a root cause. </p><p>If the survey results summarized above are valid, corruption </p><p>in public administration may be a less salient cause of </p><p>general discontent than other factors, such as the virtual </p><p>absence of in many remote areas of any effective government </p><p>services.  Perhaps the survey could have been more insightful </p><p>if it had assessed the incidence of political corruption. </p><p>End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>5. TIB\'s report, Corruption in South Asia: Insights and </p><p>Benchmarks from Citizen Feedback Surveys in Five Countries, </p><p>can be found at http://www.ti-bangladesh.org/.  The study </p><p>acknowledges a grant from USAID in making the effort possible. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
