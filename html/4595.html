(SBU) Summary:  Chiquita and its union have begun </p><p>case-by-case discussions over the contentious issue of </p><p>alleged absenteeism by a high percentage of its workforce. </p><p>EmbOffs recently toured Chiquita\'s plantation and met with </p><p>both management and labor.  EmbOffs urged them to continue </p><p>dialogue.  Both sides are seeking a mutually agreeable </p><p>solution to the problem using procedures set forth in the </p><p>collective bargaining agreement.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) Ambassador, EconOffs, and LabAtt visited Chiquita\'s </p><p>Honduran subsidiary, Tela Railroad Company, November 26 </p><p>during Ambassador\'s first trip to San Pedro Sula.  EmbOffs </p><p>met with several Chiquita representatives, including VP </p><p>Fernando Sanchez (a former Foreign Service Officer) and GM </p><p>Jose Luis Valverde, toured the plantation and packing </p><p>facility, and met with several Union of Tela Railroad Company </p><p>Workers (SITRATERCO) representatives including Secretary </p><p>General Eduardo Rivas (SITRATERCO President Oscar Amaya was </p><p>out of the country).  SITRATERCO is part of the United </p><p>Confederation of Honduran Workers (CUTH), led by Israel </p><p>Salinas.  The CUTH is one of three labor confederations in </p><p>Honduras and does not have an international affiliation. </p><p> </p><p>Chiquita and Union both on Downward Trend in Honduras </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The banana sector has long been a key aspect of U.S. </p><p>investment in Honduras, a critical part of the economy, and </p><p>the backbone of the organized labor movement.  This has all </p><p>been on a downward trend hastened by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 </p><p>that destroyed Honduras\' banana crops.   Chiquita has since </p><p>replanted 67 percent of the land that was previously </p><p>cultivated.  Production, which was once at 35 million </p><p>boxes/year in the 1980s, is now at 12-14 million boxes/year, </p><p>but since Mitch Chiquita has been able to boost productivity </p><p>through investment and a higher yield from its smaller amount </p><p>of land.  (Chiquita currently has 5,000 hectares under </p><p>cultivation in Honduras.)  SITRATERCO once had approximately </p><p>18,000 members, but now has only approximately 2,200 members </p><p>as the workforce has shrunk dramatically over the years. </p><p>Chiquita suffered a brief wildcat strike in June (reftel) </p><p>which, combined with pest problems, kept 2002 production </p><p>levels lower than Chiquita\'s goal.  One issue related to a </p><p>pest problem, the application of pesticide-treated bags </p><p>around bananas on the plants, was solved this summer after an </p><p>independent panel ruled the practice safe and Chiquita raised </p><p>the pay for workers involved in the process. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) SITRATERCO workers receive on average USD 8/day </p><p>(which is almost double the USD 4.5 minimum wage in the </p><p>export sector) plus at least that much in benefits.  The </p><p>company has plans to reduce expenses related to its benefits </p><p>package by switching from company-owned housing to subsidized </p><p>bank loans for employees to buy their own homes built by the </p><p>company on land provided by Chiquita and the GOH.  The </p><p>employees will pay approximately 25-30 percent of the actual </p><p>cost of the house and land and can continue to make payments </p><p>toward the title even if they stop working for Chiquita.  The </p><p>houses are not on the plantation, thus ending the company </p><p>town and reducing health risks from pesticide application </p><p>near housing.  Chiquita is also considering transferring the </p><p>company hospital (built in 1951) to the GOH\'s social security </p><p>system, and grandfathering current employees who have </p><p>generous health plans.  Chiquita has not yet discussed the </p><p>hospital issue with the union and asked EmbOffs to remain </p><p>silent on the issue. </p><p> </p><p>Both Sides Agree Absenteeism a Problem but Disagree on Size </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Chiquita is currently suffering problems over </p><p>alleged absenteeism by a relatively large percentage (15 </p><p>percent) of its workforce.  Ambassador and PolCouns discussed </p><p>the issue November 20 with Minister of Labor German </p><p>Leitzelar, LabAtt spoke to both management and labor November </p><p>21, and EmbOffs discussed the issue again during the November </p><p>26 visit to Chiquita.  Chiquita recently ran a full-page ad </p><p>in Honduran newspapers that detailed management\'s point of </p><p>view.  Chiquita management says it has faced the issue of </p><p>absenteeism for quite some time and could not afford to </p><p>postpone dealing with it any longer.  Productivity is low and </p><p>the Honduras operation has been losing money since 1994, said </p><p>Sanchez.  Management has two lists of employees with alleged </p><p>absenteeism problems: one list of 350-400 workers with a high </p><p>level of absenteeism that do not/not have legitimate health </p><p>problems, and another list of 350 workers with a high level </p><p>of absenteeism that do have legitimate health problems. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The union conceded to EmbOffs that absenteeism was a </p><p>problem but disputed the extent it had negatively impacted </p><p>production, and claimed management was downplaying problems </p><p>with the fruit and infrastructure.  (Chiquita management </p><p>recently funded a trip for labor representatives to travel to </p><p>Florida to meet with Chiquita customers and to hear </p><p>complaints about the quality of the bananas coming from </p><p>Honduras.)  The union also believes that some of the workers </p><p>on the list either were on vacation, maternity leave, or </p><p>extended recuperation time during their alleged absenteeism, </p><p>and that others on the list no longer work for Chiquita. </p><p>Both sides agreed that press coverage of the issue had been </p><p>erroneous. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Rivas said that the union had received the lists </p><p>from management November 21 and that a tripartite committee </p><p>comprised of management, labor, and the medical office of the </p><p>company had begun to meet November 25 to deal with the </p><p>problem on a case-by-case basis.  According to both sides, </p><p>management and labor have fifteen days to determine a final </p><p>disposition in each case of workers with a high level of </p><p>absenteeism and that do not/not have legitimate health </p><p>problems.  Management has pledged that any workers laid off </p><p>will receive their full severance pay in accordance with </p><p>Honduran law.  Cases involving workers with a high level of </p><p>absenteeism that do have legitimate health problems will take </p><p>several months to resolve.  Sanchez said that workers with </p><p>legitimate health problems will either be reintegrated into </p><p>the workforce or will receive some sort of disability </p><p>benefits.  Sanchez emphasized that this was not a ploy to </p><p>reduce the workforce and that adult dependents of those laid </p><p>off will have first shot at filling the vacant positions. </p><p>EmbOffs encouraged the sides to talk to each other to resolve </p><p>this issue directly (and not via the press) in a fair manner. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Sanchez called LabAtt November 27 to follow-up on </p><p>EmbOffs visit to Chiquita.  LabAtt urged Chiquita management </p><p>to continue to work with SITRATERCO according to the </p><p>collective bargaining agreement to resolve the cases of </p><p>alleged absenteeism.  Sanchez said he would keep the Embassy </p><p>up to date on how the process went. </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Urges Continued Dialogue </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (SBU) Comment:  Ambassador and LabAtt underlined the </p><p>importance of U.S. investment in the banana sector to </p><p>Honduras\' economic growth as well as the importance of trade </p><p>unions in Honduras to both management and labor.  Ambassador </p><p>reiterated that the Embassy\'s role was to promote the </p><p>observation of core labor rights throughout Honduras and to </p><p>help facilitate dialogue between labor and management. </p><p>EmbOffs made clear that the Honduran Ministry of Labor had </p><p>jurisdiction over labor-management problems in Honduras. </p><p>Neither side has asked for the Embassy\'s intervention to help </p><p>resolve the issue.  Post is guardedly optimistic that the two </p><p>sides will be able to resolve the majority of the cases of </p><p>alleged absenteeism through the established procedures. </p><p>However, the fact that the potential number of employees to </p><p>be dismissed is a significant percentage of the union\'s </p><p>membership could make it more difficult.  This issue of </p><p>medical care, however, could be an even more contentious </p><p>issue in the future.  End Comment. </p><p> </p><p>PIERCE </p><p></p></div>
