<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002204 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02204  01 OF 02  241241Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/24/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ZI, US, SF, WA, MZ, ZA, PGOV </p><p>SUBJECT: PROPOSAL FOR POTUS TO ENGAGE MUGABE BY </p><p>TELEPHONE ON CURRENT DISTURBANCES IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR TOM MCDONALD FOR REASON 1.5 </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) RECENT, PRESIDENTIALLY DIRECTED EVENTS HAVE </p><p>TAKEN ZIMBABWE TO THE VERGE OF CRISIS.  WE BELIEVE A </p><p>STRONG AND HIGH-LEVEL MESSAGE APPEALING FOR CALM, </p><p>RESTRAINT AND A RETURN TO DEMOCRACY AND RESPECT FOR THE </p><p>RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IS CRITICAL.  IN THIS </p><p>CONNECTION, I STRONGLY URGE THAT PRESIDENT DELIVER SUCH </p><p>A MESSAGE VIA A TELEPHONE CALL AT THE EARLIEST </p><p>OPPORTUNITY TO PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) WITH THE PROBABILITY OF BEING DRIVEN FROM OFFICE </p><p>BY THE FIRST VIABLE OPPOSITION CHALLENGE IN TWENTY </p><p>YEARS, ROBERT MUGABE HAS UNLEASHED A REIGN OF TERROR </p><p>AGAINST THE RIVAL MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) </p><p>AND THIS COUNTRY\'S WHITE FARMERS.  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE </p><p>BELIEVES THE LATTER TO BE BANKROLLING THE OPPOSITION </p><p>PARTY AND HELPING TO RECRUIT AND ORGANIZE ITS RURAL </p><p>CONSTITUENCY.  MUGABE HAS USED MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>LIBERATION WAR VETERANS\' ASSOCIATION AND THE STATE </p><p>SECURITY APPARATUS TO PERPETRATE THE VIOLENCE.  IT IS A </p><p>HARDLY SPONTANEOUS OR NATIONAL MOVEMENT; MOST RIGHT- </p><p>THINKING ZIMBABWEANS ARE REPELLED BY THE FARM </p><p>OCCUPATIONS.  WITHIN THE LAST SEVEN DAYS TWO MDC PARTY </p><p>OPERATIVES WERE KILLED IN A FIREBOMB ATTACK ON THEIR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02204  01 OF 02  241241Z </p><p>VEHICLE, TWO WHITE FARMERS WERE FATALLY SHOT, A SCORE </p><p>WERE BEATEN TO WITHIN AN INCH OF THEIR LIVES, AND </p><p>OSTENSIBLE WAR VETERANS RAPED A PAIR OF WHITE WOMEN IN </p><p>THEIR FARMHOUSE NEAR HARARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.  THE </p><p>"WAR VETERANS" HAVE BATTERED HUNDREDS OF BLACK FARM </p><p>WORKERS; STOLEN OR DESTROYED THEIR PROPERTY, AND KILLED </p><p>AN UNKNOWN NUMBER.  TO THEIR CREDIT, THE COMMERCIAL </p><p>FARMERS UNION HAS INSTRUCTED ITS MEMBERS NOT TO RESORT </p><p>TO VIOLENCE, TAKING SOME OF THE POTENTIAL FOR EXPLOSION </p><p>OUT OF THE OPERATION, AND MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE </p><p>OBJECTIVE VIEWER TO DECIDE WHO IS AT FAULT.  THE POLICE, </p><p>AT MUGABE\'S INSTRUCTION, HAVE LARGELY STOOD ON THE </p><p>SIDELINES AND PASSIVELY WATCHED THE SPECTACLE OF INJURY </p><p>AND DESTRUCTION. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) WHILE MUGABE AND THE LEADERS OF THE RULING ZANU- </p><p>PF PUT THE VIOLENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF REMOVING THE LAST </p><p>AND MOST UNJUST VESTIGE OF COLONIAL RULE, THE OWNERSHIP </p><p>OF THE LAND, IN OUR JUDGMENT THE STRUGGLE IS ALL ABOUT </p><p>POWER: WHO GETS IT AND WHO KEEPS IT.  THE PRESIDENT </p><p>STANDS TO LOSE SOME OF IT IN THE STILL UNSCHEDULED </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION.  IF THE RULING PARTY LOSES </p><p>ENOUGH SEATS, SAY OVER 50 PERCENT, MDC LEADER MORGAN </p><p>TSVANGIRAI TELLS US THAT MUGABE WOULD STEP DOWN, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>UNACCUSTOMED TO GOVERNING WITH AN OPPOSITION THAT WOULD </p><p>ACT AS A REAL CHECK TO UNTRAMMELED EXECUTIVE POWER. </p><p>MUGABE\'S VIEW OF POWER IS MANICHEAN: EITHER YOU HAVE IT </p><p>ALL OR YOU HAVE NOTHING.  MOREOVER, THE ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>PRESIDENT MUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH </p><p>PEOPLE IN ZIMBABWE WITH A GOOD REASON TO KILL HIM, AND </p><p>THAT AS AN EX-PRESIDENT HE WOULD NOT LAST LONG, AT LEAST </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  02204  01 OF 02  241241Z </p><p>STAYING IN THE COUNTRY HE HELPED FOUND.  THEREFORE, WE </p><p>THINK THAT HE WILL NOT CALL FOR AN ELECTION UNTIL HE IS </p><p>CERTAIN THAT HE WILL WIN IT OVERWHELMINGLY.  IF HIS </p><p>POLITICAL NOSE TELLS HIM THAT CONDITIONS DO NOT EXIST </p><p>FOR THAT OUTCOME TO OCCUR WITHIN THE TIME FRAME </p><p>PRESCRIBED BY THE CONSTITUTION, THERE IS SUFFICIENT </p><p>TURMOIL IN THE COUNTRY FOR HIM TO DECLARE MARTIAL LAW OR </p><p>A STATE OF EMERGENCY, WHICH HE COULD USE TO SCRUB THE </p><p>ELECTION AND RULE BY DECREE. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) WE HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF DEMARCHES TO MINISTERS </p><p>AND EVEN TO PRESIDENT MUGABE HIMSELF TO ENFORCE THE LAW. </p><p>I HAVE PURSUED OUR DONOR COLLEAGUES WITH VIGOR TO WEIGH </p><p>IN JOINTLY WITH US TO THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT, BUT </p><p>HAVE HEARD NOTHING BUT DEMURRALS, TEMPORIZING, AND EVEN </p><p>A CLEAR "NO;" THEY ALL WANT THEIR CAPITALS TO TAKE THE </p><p>LEAD.  I THINK THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO RATCHET </p><p>UP THE PRESSURE UNILATERALLY.  THE NEXT STEP, IN MY </p><p>VIEW, IS TO REQUEST THE PRESIDENT TO MAKE A TELEPHONE </p><p>CALL TO MUGABE.  I MUST STRESS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE </p><p>NOTHING LESS THAN A TELEPHONE CALL, AS A LETTER COULD </p><p>VERY WELL BE IGNORED (MUGABE WOULD KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN </p><p>DRAFTED BY A SUBORDINATE AND LIKELY NOT EVEN SEEN BY THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTO6697 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  02204  02 OF 02  241241Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    ACQ-00   CIAE-00  SMEC-00  INL-01   DODE-00 </p><p>      DOEE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EUR-01   FBIE-00  VC-01    H-01 </p><p>      TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00    L-00     AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    IRM-00   SSO-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  R-00     PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------4F2F90  241241Z /38 </p><p>O 241244Z APR 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5826 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>AMEMBASSY PRETORIA </p><p>AMCONSUL CAPE TOWN </p><p>AMEMBASSY MAPUTO </p><p>AMEMBASSY WINDHOEK </p><p>AMEMBASSY LUSAKA </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 HARARE 002204 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  02204  02 OF 02  241241Z </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/24/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ZI, US, SF, WA, MZ, ZA </p><p>SUBJECT: PROPOSAL FOR POTUS TO ENGAGE MUGABE BY </p><p>TELEPHONE ON CURRENT DISTURBANCES IN ZIMBABWE </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT.  ALSO, THE CLEARANCE PROCESS MAY RESULT IN A </p><p>MESSAGE THAT IS EITHER EQUIVOCAL OR TOOTHLESS.  WHAT IS </p><p>OCCURRING HERE DEMANDS MORE.  WHILE POTUS HAS NOT </p><p>DIRECTLY ENGAGED MUGABE IN THE PAST, I BELIEVE THAT HIS </p><p>PERSONAL WARMTH, STYLE, AND DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO </p><p>AFRICA WILL GO A LONG WAY.  IF THE PRESIDENT IS </p><p>UNAVAILABLE, THEN STRONG CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN </p><p>TO ASKING VICE PRESIDENT GORE TO PLACE THE CALL. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE PRINCIPAL PITFALL IN A TELEPHONE CALL IS </p><p>THAT MUGABE WILL MAKE AN EFFORT TO DRAW THE PRESIDENT </p><p>INTO A DEBATE ON THE LAND ISSUE IN ZIMBABWE, AND THE </p><p>USG\'S OSTENSIBLE OBLIGATIONS IN THAT REGARD.  WE WOULD </p><p>URGE THAT THE PRESIDENT STEER AWAY FROM THE TOPIC TO THE </p><p>EXTENT POSSIBLE, AND FOCUS ON THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY\'S VIEW OF RECENT EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE AND WHAT </p><p>IT COULD MEAN DOWN THE ROAD.  WITHOUT MINCING WORDS, THE </p><p>BEST TACTICAL APPROACH IN THIS CONVERSATION WOULD BE TO </p><p>EMPHASIZE HISTORY\'S VIEW OF LEADERS: THE LAURELS FOR </p><p>THOSE WHO ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO RISE TO THE DEMANDS OF A </p><p>SITUATION, VERSUS BRICKBATS OR OBLIVION FOR THOSE WHO </p><p>HAVE BEEN BLINDED BY SHORT-TERM CIRCUMSTANCE.  MUGABE </p><p>VALUES HIS LEGACY AND MAY WELL PROVE MOST RECEPTIVE TO </p><p>AN APPROACH ALONG THESE LINES.  THE PRESIDENT SHOULD </p><p>STRESS TO MUGABE THAT: </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  02204  02 OF 02  241241Z </p><p>-- WHILE NOT PULLING PUNCHES WITH REGARDS TO U.S. </p><p>CONCERNS ABOUT SUCH ISSUES AS THE GOZ\'S FAILURE TO </p><p>UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW AND MUGABE\'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS </p><p>THAT CAN BE READ AS AN INCITEMENT TO RACIAL OR POLITICAL </p><p>VIOLENCE, WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR DESIRE TO WORK WITH </p><p>ZIMBABWE BOTH TO ADDRESS THE STILL-UNRESOLVED LAND </p><p>ISSUE, AND TO HELP HALT THE COUNTRY\'S DOWNWARD ECONOMIC </p><p>AND POLITICAL SPIRAL; </p><p> </p><p>-- AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE, </p><p>MUGABE\'S FIRST RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ENSURE THAT THE RULE </p><p>OF LAW IS UPHELD; </p><p> </p><p>-- THE U.S. VIEWS ZIMBABWE AS A FELLOW DEMOCRACY, AND </p><p>THAT IN DEMOCRACIES PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT AND FREEDOM TO </p><p>CHANGE THEIR GOVERNMENT VIA THE BALLOT BOX; AND </p><p> </p><p>-- THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC </p><p>MORASS, SINCE FARMERS, ESPECIALLY NEW ONES, NEED PEACE, </p><p>PREDICTABILITY AND BANK LINES TO PLOW THEIR FIELDS AND </p><p>REAP THE FRUITS OF THEIR EFFORTS. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
