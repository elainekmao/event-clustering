<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 PRETORIA 17357 </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR MCKINLEY; PARIS FOR FENDRICK </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINS, SF </p><p>SUBJECT:  THABO MBEKI ON THE STATE OF PLAY </p><p> </p><p>REF:  (A) STATE 340610             (B) PRETORIA 16918 </p><p>      (C) PRETORIA 17247 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  IN A TWO HOUR MEETING WITH DCM MCCALLIE, ANC </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR THABO MBEKI OUTLINED </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS IN ANC-INKATHA PEACE TALKS, CONTINUING SIGNS </p><p>OF FOUL PLAY BY SECURITY FORCE ELEMENTS, AND THE STATUS OF </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SAG.  OF KEY IMPORTANCE, MBEKI SAID: </p><p> </p><p>  --  ANC AND INKATHA HAVE AGREED TO COOPERATE ON LOCAL </p><p>PEACE TREATIES IN THE NATAL AREAS MOST AFFECTED BY </p><p>VIOLENCE, LEADING TO A SUMMIT MEETING OF TOP OFFICIALS </p><p>FROM EACH SIDE, INCLUDING MANDELA AND BUTHELEZI. </p><p> </p><p>  --  EVIDENCE, THOUGH NOT FIRM PROOF, CONTINUES TO </p><p>SURFACE THAT ELEMENTS OF THE SECURITY FORCES ARE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR INCITING BLACK-ON-BLACK VIOLENCE; </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE TO ACT AGAINST THESE ELEMENTS OR </p><p>APPOINT A JUDICIAL ENQUIRY AGGRAVATES ANC MISTRUST. </p><p> </p><p>  --  THE ANC IS PREPARED TO EXPLORE CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>MATTERS WITH THE SAG IN THE APPROPRIATE WORKING GROUP, BUT </p><p>THE SAG HAS STALLED THESE DISCUSSIONS UNTIL VIOLENCE IS </p><p>DOWN AND MORE PROGRESS IS REGISTERED IN THE ARMED-ACTIONS </p><p>WORKING GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  DCM MCCALLIE AND POLOFF LUCAS CALLED ON ANC </p><p>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT CHIEF THABO MBEKI AND </p><p>FELLOW NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE (NEC) MEMBER AZIZ </p><p>PAHAD OCTOBER 21 AT THE LATTER\'S TEMPORARY RESIDENCE IN </p><p>MAYFAIR, JOHANNESBURG.  DURING THE TWO-HOUR DISCUSSION, </p><p>THE DCM PRESENTED REF A DEMARCHE (WHICH HE INDICATED HAD </p><p>ALSO BEEN DELIVERED TO BUTHELEZI - REF B) AND COVERED A </p><p>RANGE OF OTHER TOPICS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>NATAL PEACE:  WORKING FROM THE GROUND UP </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  IN RESPONSE TO OUR POINTS ON ENDING ANC-INKATHA </p><p>CONFLICT, MBEKI EXPLAINED THAT THE JOINT ANC-INKATHA </p><p>COMMITTEE ON VIOLENCE HAD REACHED AGREEMENT TO PURSUE </p><p>SERIATIM LOCAL PEACE TREATIES IN THE MOST VOLATILE AREAS </p><p>OF NATAL AS A WAY OF LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR A </p><p>MANDELA-BUTHELEZI SUMMIT.  THE SIDES HAD AGREED, MBEKI </p><p>CLAIMED, THAT A FAILED SUMMIT -- ONE WHICH DID NOTHING TO </p><p>HALT THE VIOLENCE -- WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD.  THE </p><p>INKATHA DELEGATION, LED BY FRANK MDLALOSE, SEEMED </p><p>GENUINELY COMMITTED TO THE PEACE PROCESS AND APPARENTLY </p><p>HAD BUTHELEZI\'S FULL BLESSING.  FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF </p><p>THE EMPANGENI (OR NORTHERN NATL) ACCORD, LOCAL AGREEMENTS </p><p>WERE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED IN MPUMALANGA, NDWEDWE AND </p><p>ELSEWHERE.  TYPICALLY, ANC AND INKATHA MEMBERS OF THE </p><p>JOINT COMMITTEE WOULD TRAVEL TOGETHER TO THE AFFECTED </p><p>AREAS, CALL TOGETHER LOCAL LEADERS FROM BOTH FACTIONS, AND </p><p>HELP BROKER A PEACE TREATY. </p><p> </p><p>5.  MBEKI HOPED THIS PROCESS WOULD EVENTUALLY SUCCEED IN </p><p>HALTING VIOLENCE, BUT WARNED THAT PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND </p><p>INKATHA SHOWED SIGNS OF DIVISION.  SOME ELEMENTS WISHED TO </p><p>DERAIL THE ADMITTEDLY DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS.  INKATHA </p><p>JOINT COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE SOMETIMES RELUCTANT TO DEFY </p><p>THESE ELEMENTS OPENLY.  RUMORS HAD IT IN ONE CASE THAT </p><p>BUTHELEZI HIMSELF INCITED LOCAL CHIEFS TO OPPOSE ANC PEACE </p><p>INITIATIVES.  HARD WORK WOULD BE REQUIRED TO KEEP THE </p><p>PROCESS ON TRACK AND SUSTAIN MOMENTUM, MBEKI SAID; BOTH </p><p>SIDES NEEDED TO DESIGNATE OFFICIALS WHO COULD DEVOTE FULL </p><p>TIME TO IT. </p><p> </p><p>6.  MBEKI SAID THIS PROGRESS ON THE GROUND WOULD HELP </p><p>ENSURE A PRODUCTIVE SUMMIT MEETING.  THE (##) EXECUTIVE </p><p>COMMITTEE (NEC) AND INKATHA\'S </p><p>CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  THE INKATHA LEADERSHIP WAS NO LONGER </p><p>INSISTING EXCLUSIVELY ON A ONE-ON-ONE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN </p><p>MANDELA AND BUTHELEZI, NOR WAS MANDELA REFUSING TO MEET </p><p>BUTHELEZI, MBEKI STATED.  DATES FOR THE AGREED GATHERING </p><p>WOULD BE SET ONCE MANDELA RETURNS FROM ABROAD.  (NOTE: </p><p>REF C REPORTS AN OCTOBER 22 ANC STATEMENT WHICH PROPOSES A </p><p>MEETING OF TOP ANC AND INKATHA OFFICIALS, INCLUDING </p><p>MANDELA AND BUTHELEZI, "WITHIN THE NEAR FUTURE."  END </p><p>NOTE.) </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>REEF VIOLENCE:  SECURITY FORCE ELEMENTS </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS, MBEKI STOOD BY THE FAMILIAR </p><p>ANC VIEW THAT "ELEMENTS OF THE SECURITY FORCES" ARE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR INCITING VIOLENCE IN REEF TOWNSHIPS.  "WE </p><p>ARE QUITE SURE THE VIOLENCE IS NOT SPONTANEOUS," HE SAID, </p><p>BUT INSTIGATED IN ORDER TO "DISCREDIT THE MOVEMENT AND </p><p>WEAKEN THE ANC."  EVIDENCE INCRIMINATING WHITE POLICE </p><p>OFFICERS, FORMER RENAMO AGENTS, AND CCB-STYLE OPERATIVES </p><p>CONTINUES TO MOUNT.  INKATHA ELEMENTS, PROBABLY RECRUITED </p><p>DIRECTLY BY SOUTH AFRICAN SECURITY SERVICES, ARE ALSO </p><p>INVOLVED, MBEKI CLAIMED. </p><p> </p><p>8.  MBEKI ADMITTED THAT MOST LEADS IN ANC\'S POSSESSION </p><p>COULD NOT PASS FOR PROOF IN A COURT OF LAW.  HE ARGUED, </p><p>HOWEVER, THAT THE ANC -- IN ITS CURRENT "UNDERSTAFFED, </p><p>UNDERFINANCED" STATE -- CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP SUCH </p><p>INFORMATION.  ONLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESOURCES TO DO </p><p>SO.  THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE (NIS) CONCEDES THIS </p><p>POINT, BUT LAW AND ORDER MINISTER VLOK AND HIS POLICE </p><p>OFFICIALS STILL INSIST THAT THE ANC MUST PROVIDE MORE </p><p>INFORMATION BEFORE THEY CAN ACT.  THIS ATTITUDE, TOGETHER </p><p>WITH DE KLERK\'S REFUSAL TO LAUNCH A JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION </p><p>INTO THE CAUSES OF THE VIOLENCE, CREATES AN IMPRESSION IN </p><p>ANC RANKS THAT PRETORIA HAS A HIDDEN AGENDA TO UNDERMINE </p><p>ANC SUPPORT.  MBEKI WONDERED WHETHER THE SAG MIGHT ALSO </p><p>FEAR REPERCUSSIONS FROM THE SECURITY FORCES IF STRONG </p><p>ACTION IS TAKEN AGAINST ROGUE ELEMENTS.  HE LAMENTED THE </p><p>FACT THAT ANC\'S SHORTAGE OF MANPOWER HAD PREVENTED THE </p><p>ORGANIZATION FROM THOROUGHLY CANVASSING BLACK TOWNSHIP </p><p>POLICEMEN, MANY OF WHOM HAVE INFORMATION ON THE IMPROPER </p><p>ACTIVITIES OF THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>PROGRESS TOWARD NEGOTIATIONS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS WORKING GROUP.  ASKED WHEN THE </p><p>ANC-SAG DIALOGUE WOULD BE BROADENED TO INCLUDE OTHER </p><p>POLITICAL ACTORS, MBEKI EXPLAINED THAT MUCH WORK STILL </p><p>NEEDED TO BE DONE BILATERALLY.  THE SAG AGREES THAT A </p><p>WORKING GROUP SHOULD CONSIDER CONSTITUTIONAL MATTERS, BUT </p><p>VILJOEN HAS DECLINED TO PURSUE THESE MATTERS BEYOND A </p><p>SINGLE MEETING (WITH THABO MBEKI) WHICH DID NO MORE THAN </p><p>SET AN AGENDA FOR ANC-SAG EXPLORATORY TALKS.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>MBEKI, CONSTITUTIONAL PLANNING MINISTER VILJOEN HAS PLACED </p><p>TWO CONDITIONS ON FURTHER CONSTITUTIONAL DISCUSSIONS:  A </p><p>DECREASE IN VIOLENCE COUNTRYWIDE AND MORE PROGRESS IN THE </p><p>ARMED-ACTIONS WORKING GROUP. </p><p> </p><p>10.  "THE SAG HAS STALLED THE PROCESS," MBEKI ASSERTED, BY </p><p>LINKING PROGRESS IN VARIOUS WORKING GROUPS.  THE ANC </p><p>ARGUES THT THE DIFFERENT TRACKS SHOULD BE PURSUED </p><p>SIMULTANEOUSLY, NOT SEQUENTIALLY.  THE ANC BELIEVES THE </p><p>WORKING GROUP ON CONSTITUTIONAL MATTERS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY </p><p>TAKE UP CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AND NEGOTIATION </p><p>PROCESSES WITH A VIEW TO REPORTING AREAS OF AGREEMENT AND </p><p>DISAGREEMENT TO THE NEXT ANC-SAG SUMMIT, "GROOTE SCHUUR </p><p>III."  THE QUESTION OF WHO SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL NEGOTIATIONS AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE </p><p>SELECTED NEEDS TO BE THRASHED OUT BEFORE THE TALKS CAN BE </p><p>BROADENED. </p><p> </p><p>11.  ARMED ACTIONS WORKING GROUP.  IN THIS FORUM, MBEKI </p><p>COMPLAINED, THE SAG WAS ATTEMPTING TO CONVERT THE ANC\'S </p><p>COMMITMENT TO SUSPEND ARMED ACTIONS INTO AN ABANDONMENT OF </p><p>THE ARMED STRUGGLE.  PRETORIA CHOOSES TO INTERPRET "ARMED </p><p>ACTIONS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES" (SEE THE PRETORIA MINUTE) </p><p>VERY BROADLY TO INCLUDE RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING OF MK </p><p>SOLDIERS.  FOR THE ANC\'S PART, IT IS WILLING TO END </p><p>VIOLENT ACTS, INFILTRATION OF MEN AND ARMS, AND IN-COUNTRY </p><p>TRAINING, BUT WOULD CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A FIGHTING FORCE </p><p>OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  FURTHER, THE ANC FEELS IT HAS NO </p><p>OBLIGATION TO TURN OVER WEAPONS ALREADY STOCKPILED IN </p><p>SOUTH AFRICA. </p><p> </p><p>12.  POLITICAL OFFENSES WORKING GROUP.  MBEKI SAID </p><p>PROBLEMS IN THE POLITICAL OFFENSES WORKING GROUP ARE </p><p>MANAGEABLE.  THE GROUP\'S FOLLOW-UP REPORT, DUE FOR RELEASE </p><p>THIS WEEK, WOULD CLARIFY CERTAIN AMBIGUITIES, E.G., HOW TO </p><p>APPLY FOR SUSPENSION OF POLITICAL TRIALS IN PROGRESS, AND </p><p>WHO MUST COMPLETE THE EXILES\' QUESTIONNAIRE.  THERE IS </p><p>ANC-SAG AGREEMENT THAT THE BULK OF SECURITY PRISONERS </p><p>WOULD BE FREE BY YEAR\'S END; "THERE SHOULD BE NO ONE ON </p><p>ROBBEN ISLAND BY JANUARY 1," MBEKI SAID.  COMPLICATED </p><p>SECURITY CASES, AND THOSE INVOLVING PUBLIC VIOLENCE FOR </p><p>POLITICAL REASONS, WOULD BE REVIEWED BY COMMITTEE BEFORE </p><p>THE END OF APRIL, ACCORDING TO THE PRETORIA MINUTE. </p><p> </p><p>13.  ON A PHILOSOPHICAL NOTE, MBEKI IDENTIFIED THE SOURCE </p><p>OF MUCH ANC-SAG DISAGREEMENT AS A DIFFERENCE IN </p><p>MIND-SETS.  THE ANC ASSUMES THAT ACCORDS REACHED BETWEEN </p><p>THE TWO PARTIES SHOULD OVERRIDE EXISTING LAW.  MEANWHILE, </p><p>THE SAG SEEMS INCLINED TO SEEK CHANGES IN ANC-SAG </p><p>AGREEMENTS IF THEY COME INTO CONFLICT WITH STANDING </p><p>LEGISLATION.  THUS, THOUGH THE ARMED-ACTIONS WORKING GROUP </p><p>HAS BEEN MANDATED TO DISCUSS THE DISPOSITION OF ANC </p><p>WEAPONRY, SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE STILL INSIST ON THE </p><p>ILLEGALITY OF ARMS CACHES.  SIMILAR CONFUSION HAS ARISEN </p><p>BECAUSE THE LAW STIPULATES THAT APPLICATIONS FOR INDEMNITY </p><p>MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE STATE PRESIDENT, YET THE </p><p>POLITICAL OFFENSES WORKING GROUP AGREED TO INDEMNIFY WHOLE </p><p>CLASSES OF EXILES EN MASSE.  FINALLY, THE SAG INSISTS ON </p><p>USHERING IN THE NEW CONSTITUTION THROUGH EXISTING </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURES, WHILE THE ANC THINKS A GENERAL </p><p>REFERENDUM WOULD SERVE TO LAUNCH A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT. </p><p>IN ANY CASE, MBEKI SAID, DE KLERK SEEMS CONFIDENT THAT HE </p><p>CAN WIN APPROVAL FOR THE RESULTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL </p><p>NEGOTIATIONS, AND PREVENT THE RIGHT WING FROM BLOCKING AN </p><p>AGREEMENT. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  IN STARK CONTRAST TO BUTHELEZI\'S DEFENSIVENESS (REF </p><p>B), MBEKI\'S RESPONSE TO OUR INTEREST IN ANC-INKATHA </p><p>RAPPROCHEMENT WAS A DISPASSIONATE, UPBEAT EXPLANATION OF </p><p>ONGOING EFFORTS, SPRINKLED WITH WARNINGS ABOUT THE </p><p>DELICACY AND VULNERABILITY OF THE PROCESS.  WE AGREE THAT </p><p>PROGRESS TOWARD PEACE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WILL IMPROVE </p><p>PROSPECTS FOR A FRUITFUL SUMMIT AND BELIEVE A CAREFULLY </p><p>TIMED JOINT MEETING OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES, LED BY </p><p>BUTHELEZI AND MANDELA, COULD BE PRODUCTIVE. </p><p> </p><p>15.  MBEKI\'S SUGGESTION THAT THE SAG HAS INTRODUCED </p><p>LINKAGE INTO THE WORKING GROUP EXERCISE MERITS </p><p>INVESTIGATION.  IF TRUE, IT IS IRONIC THAT AS THE ANC </p><p>MOVES AWAY FROM THE RIGID, SEQUENTIAL PROGRAM OUTLINED IN </p><p>THE HARARE DECLARATION, THE SAG MAY HAVE BECOME LESS </p><p>FLEXIBLE IN ITS APPROACH TO THE JOINT WORKING GROUPS. </p><p> </p><p>16.  CONSISTENT WITH ITS SELF-IMAGE AS THE PRIME </p><p>OPPOSITION FORCE, THE ANC PROBABLY SEEKS TO ESTABLISH THE </p><p>LARGEST POSSIBLE AREA OF AGREEMENT WITH THE SAG ON </p><p>CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES BEFORE OTHER PARTIES JOIN THE </p><p>DISCUSSION.  THE SAG, ON THE OTHER HAND, MIGHT NOW WISH TO </p><p>LIMIT THE CONSTITUTIONAL DIALOGUE UNTIL OTHER PARTIES </p><p>CLOSER TO PRETORIA\'S THINKING ARE BROUGHT ON BOARD.  END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>SWING. </p><p></p></div>
