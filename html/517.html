<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 02619 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/TB AND INM/AMB BORG </p><p>CINCPAC ALSO FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PINR, BM </p><p>SUBJECT:  BURMA\'S APRIL 23 "PALACE COUP" </p><p> </p><p>REF:  RANGOON 2558 (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p>1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  ON MAY 6-7, TWO SOURCES WITH UNUSUALLY GOOD </p><p>ACCESS TO BURMA\'S MILITARY LEADERSHIP PROVIDED CHARGE </p><p>WITH A TOUR D\'HORIZON ON RECENT POLITICAL </p><p>DEVELOPMENTS HERE.  BOTH CONFIRMED OUR INITIAL </p><p>ASSESSMENT OF BURMA\'S APRIL 23 "PALACE COUP" WHEREIN </p><p>FORMER HEAD OF STATE AND ARMED FORCES COMMANDER SAW </p><p>MAUNG CEDED PLACE TO GENERAL THAN SHWE WHILE </p><p>INTELLIGENCE KHIN NYUNT REMAINED "DE FACTO PRIME </p><p>MINISTER" AND BEARER OF NE WIN\'S EPISODIC POLICY </p><p>SUGGESTIONS (REFTEL).  CONCURRING THAT SAW MAUNG WAS </p><p>GONE FOREVER DESPITE FACESAVING OFFICIAL RHETORIC TO </p><p>THE CONTRARY, THEY NOTED THAT HIS SECURITY </p><p>DETACHMENTS (ABOUT 1300 SOLDIERS IN ALL) HAD BEEN </p><p>TRANSFERRED WITHIN 24 HOURS.  AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER </p><p>HAVE ALSO BEEN DETAINED FOR QUESTIONING BY MILITARY </p><p>INTELLIGENCE (DDSI).  ADDITIONALLY, THE DDSI IS </p><p>CLOSELY MONITORING ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF TIN 00 AND </p><p>SEVERAL OTHER SENIOR MILITARY WHO HAD ARGUED FOR </p><p>KEEPING SAW MAUNG IN POWER DURING SEVERAL MID-APRIL </p><p>SLORC STRATEGY SESSIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ONE SOURCE, A LONGTIME NE WIN CONFIDANTE, SAID </p><p>THAT SAW MAUNG\'S RETIREMENT, WHILE PRECIPITATED BY A </p><p>SHARP DECLINE IN HIS HEALTH IN EARLY APRIL, HAD </p><p>ACTUALLY BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. </p><p>IMPARTING MESSAGES VIA KHIN NYUNT, NE WIN HAD AT </p><p>LEAST TWICE PUT OUT THE WORD THAT IT WAS TIME FOR THE </p><p>AILING SENIOR GENERAL TO CONSIDER STEPPING DOWN. </p><p>COMMENT:  THIS TRACKS WITH EARLIER AARO/RANGOON </p><p>REPORTING AND OTHER EMBASSY INTELLIGENCE.  HOWEVER, </p><p>IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE INITIAL IMPETUS CAME FROM </p><p>NE WIN OR FROM THAN SHWE/KHIN NYUNT WHO HAD EARLIER </p><p>PUSHED SAW MAUNG UNSUCCESSFULLY TO INITIATE SOME </p><p>POLITICAL/ECONOMIC REFORMS.  IN THIS REGARD, OUR </p><p>OTHER SOURCE -- THE ONLY FOREIGNER GENUINELY CLOSE TO </p><p>THE JUNTA -- ALLOWED THAT IT WAS DISTINCTLY POSSIBLE </p><p>THAT KHIN NYUNT HAD PRESENTED NE WIN WITH REASONS FOR </p><p>LEVERING SAW MAUNG OUT OF POWER.  THESE MAY THEN HAVE </p><p>BEEN PLAYED BACK, WITH NE WIN\'S IMPRIMATUR, TO THE </p><p>COLLECTIVE SLORC IN MID-APRIL. </p><p> </p><p>4.  ONE INFORMANT NOTED THAT WHILE THE SLORC HAD </p><p>COLLECTIVELY AGREED THAT SAW MAUNG SHOULD STEP DOWN, </p><p>THE FINAL PUSH CAME VIA A FOLLOW-UP LETTER FROM NE </p><p>WIN.  QUOTING SAW MAUNG\'S SON AND STAFF AIDE AS HIS </p><p>SOURCES, OUR INTERLOCUTOR SAID THE LETTER HAD BEEN </p><p>HAND DELIVERED BY A "WEEPY" KHIN NYUNT.  REACTING </p><p>ANGRILY -- "NE WIN COULD HAVE TOLD ME PERSONALLY" -- </p><p>SAW MAUNG THEN DESPATCHED HIS SON TO NE WIN\'S </p><p>RESIDENCE WITH A RECLAMA, WHICH PROVED UNSUCCESSFUL. </p><p>THEREAFTER, SAW MAUNG WAS UNDER HEAVY SEDATION MIXED </p><p>WITH PULLS FROM THE BOTTLE, AND ALL BUT INERT ON </p><p>APRIL 23. </p><p> </p><p>5.  LOOKING AHEAD, BOTH SOURCES SAID THAT THE NEW </p><p>REGIME\'S RECENT POSITIVE STEPS DID NOT PRESAGE A </p><p>WHOLESALE LIBERALIZATION OF BURMA.  THE MILITARY </p><p>MIND-SET THAT PERCEIVES THE ARMY AS "INDISPENSIBLE TO </p><p>A BELEAGUERED, FRAGILE NATION" IS STILL THERE.  THAT </p><p>SAID, THEY EXPECTED AT LEAST HALTING PROGRESS TOWARDS </p><p>A COSMETIC DEMOCRACY AND TRUE ECONOMIC REFORM.  TO </p><p>THESE ENDS, SENIOR REGIONAL COMMANDERS ARE TO BE </p><p>CALLED IN WITHIN A WEEK OR SO TO DISCUSS BANKING </p><p>LIBERALIZATION, CURRENCY RATE READJUSTMENT AND WAYS </p><p>TO BUILD ON THE RECENT GOB CEASE-FIRE VIS-A-VIS THE </p><p>KAREN INSURGENTS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  AS FOR THE STABILITY OF BURMA\'S REVISED MILITARY </p><p>LEADERSHIP, NEITHER FORESAW AN/ SPECIFIC IMPENDING </p><p>PROBLEMS.  THAN SHWE, THOUGH NOT PARTICULARLY CLOSE </p><p>TO THE OLDER MEMBERS OF THE SLORC, ENJOYS GENERALLY </p><p>GOOD TIES WITH THE KEY UPCOUNTRY COMMANDERS AND </p><p>ACCEPTABLE WORKING RELATIONS WITH KHIN NYUNT AND </p><p>OTHER MAJOR PLAYERS IN RANGOON.  ALSO, LEST THE </p><p>WATERS BE UNDULY ROILED (AND TO CONCENTRATE HIS OWN </p><p>POWER), THE NEW HEAD OF STATE PLANS FOR NOW TO LEAVE </p><p>THE DEPUTY ARMED FORCES COMMANDER AND ARMY CINC </p><p>POSITIONS VACANT.  COMMENT:  WE HAVE ALSO HEARD </p><p>INDICATIONS THAT THAN SHWE HAS ABOLISHED OR WILL SOON </p><p>ABOLISH THESE POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HUDDLE </p><p></p></div>
