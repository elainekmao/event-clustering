<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ISTANBUL 000127 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/29/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAO, PTER, KISL, TK </p><p>SUBJECT: RISING ANTI-AMERICAN SENTIMENT AND U.S. POLICY </p><p>TOWARDS IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ISTANBUL 108 AND 114 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 549 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Widespread and increasingly vocal opposition </p><p>to a possible war against Iraq is on the verge of evolving </p><p>into a more general anti-American backlash in Istanbul.  Our </p><p>observations, Istanbul contacts, and recent polls and surveys </p><p>lead us to believe that anti-American sentiment is sharply </p><p>rising in Istanbul.  "sessiz Although much of this opposition is </p><p>directed primarily at our policies in Iraq, the overall </p><p>climate provides fertile ground for extremists hostile </p><p>towards the United States.  Some leftist groups (including </p><p>terrorist groups DHKP-C and KADEK) and the populist media </p><p>tycoon and would-be politician Cem Uzan are seizing the </p><p>opportunity to stir up trouble and rally support to their </p><p>causes.  U.S. reassurances of its commitment to Iraq\'s </p><p>territorial integrity and support for an economic assistance </p><p>package are helping to address Turkish concerns.  However, </p><p>sustained public diplomacy in Istanbul -- with 15% of the </p><p>country\'s population and key opinion makers in media, higher </p><p>education, and business -- remains critical to winning the </p><p>Turkish public\'s support for our goals in Iraq.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) We have been following with concern the fervent and </p><p>widespread opposition in Istanbul to U.S. policy in Iraq. </p><p>Recent polls (E.G., the Pew Global Attitudes Project and </p><p>local polls) affirm that up to 90% of Turks oppose U.S. </p><p>military action against Iraq and that anti-American sentiment </p><p>is on the rise in Turkey.  We have observed that Istanbul </p><p>reflects those trends.  In recent months, ConGen Istanbul has </p><p>consistently found Turks to be much more vocal and critical </p><p>of U.S. policies towards Iraq and the Middle East.  "No to </p><p>War" bumper stickers and placards have been plastered across </p><p>the city, and the Consulate has received dozens of virulent, </p><p>even threatening, anti-war letters. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The frequency and attendance of anti-war </p><p>demonstrations have been steadily increasing over the last </p><p>month.  In the largest demonstration so far, over 5000 </p><p>protesters gathered in Beyazit square on January 26 </p><p>brandishing placards reading "Damn U.S. Imperialism" and "We </p><p>Won\'t Be The U.S. Soldiers" (ref A) (Note: Press reports </p><p>indicate that there was a much larger demonstration in the </p><p>southeastern city of Mersin on the same day.  End Note).  A </p><p>meeting of over 2000 organizational representatives on </p><p>January 25 was held in Istanbul to plan for even larger </p><p>demonstrations in the coming weeks.  Demonstrators dumped a </p><p>(presumably) American military uniform and boots on the steps </p><p>of a prominent Turkish business association last week to </p><p>protest the chairman\'s recent "hawkish" public remarks. </p><p>Turkish police sources told us last week that they suspect </p><p>that these demonstrations are being secretly sponsored by </p><p>various anti-American leftist groups, including DHKP-C, MLKP </p><p>(Marxist Leninist Communist Party), and KADEK (formerly the </p><p>PKK) terrorist cells. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Others are also seizing the opportunity to fan the </p><p>flames of anti-Americanism and gather personal support. </p><p>Recent spurious allegations that the U.S. has had official </p><p>contacts with KADEK/PKK in northern Iraq have received </p><p>considerable Istanbul-based national press coverage (ref B). </p><p>Additionally, media tycoon and Youth Party leader Cem Uzan </p><p>has reached out to all of Istanbul (as well as the rest of </p><p>Turkey) over the last week with an enormous anti-American </p><p>media campaign  (Note: Uzan\'s Youth Party emerged just a few </p><p>months before last year\'s November 3 elections and captured </p><p>over 7 percent of the national vote with its anti-American, </p><p>anti-Western populist rhetoric.  End Note).  Using print, </p><p>radio, and television, Uzan has put out a well-crafted, </p><p>populist, anti-war message under the title "Who is the U.S. </p><p>Attacking?"  Uzan\'s message strikes popular chords by </p><p>touching on themes like "Turkey should make its own decision </p><p>on war," "The U.S. has not kept its promises to compensate </p><p>Turkey for $100 billion in damages from the Gulf War," and </p><p>"Who will suffer from this anti-Muslim U.S. aggression?"  Not </p><p>content with using his private media outlets, Uzan has bought </p><p>air and radio time as well as entire pages in all of the </p><p>major newspapers.  Local staff tells us that this campaign is </p><p>unprecedented in its coverage and cost. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) All of this is troubling to Americans who know Turkey </p><p>well.  Turkish hospitality is unstinting and Turkish-American </p><p>friendship runs deep.  Additionally, U.S. "soft power" in </p><p>Turkey appears alive and well. Turkey sends over 10,000 </p><p>students to study at American universities every year </p><p>(placing it in the top ten countries worldwide).  Turkish </p><p>television routinely features American programs (current fare </p><p>includes Friends, Ally McBeal, Dawson\'s Creek, and NYPD Blue) </p><p>in prime time network slots, and NBC and CNN also have </p><p>popular local franchises.  American films dominate local </p><p>theaters, and American pop music has made significant inroads </p><p>in local radio programming.  U.S. products, from McDonald\'s </p><p>and Coca-Cola to Ford automobiles and Boeing aircraft, are </p><p>commonplace. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) Nonetheless, our sense is that the reservoir of good </p><p>will towards the United States is gradually being depleted. </p><p>Simple opposition to U.S. policies (i.e. "what we do") among </p><p>the large majority of Turks who are generally sympathetic to </p><p>the U.S. is spilling over and contributing to the small core </p><p>of anti-American Turks who dislike "who we are."  The Pew </p><p>Project found that only 31 percent of Turks had a positive </p><p>view of "Americans" (versus 30 percent of the U.S.), 78 </p><p>percent viewed the spread of U.S. ideas and customs </p><p>negatively, and 46 percent disliked American popular culture. </p><p> The timing and the discrepancy between the intensely </p><p>pro-American mood in late 1999 and early 2000 (following </p><p>former President Clinton\'s November 1999 visit to Turkey) and </p><p>the generally pessimistic mood last summer during the waning </p><p>months of the unpopular Ecevit government may have </p><p>exaggerated these numbers.  But this cannot fully account for </p><p>the sharp turn in public opinion against the United States </p><p>that we observe in Istanbul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Most Istanbul Turks continue to value the </p><p>U.S.-Turkey strategic alliance and enjoy American products. </p><p>Adversely affected by the ongoing economic crisis, however, </p><p>many in this group mistakenly blame the IMF (and, by </p><p>extension, the U.S.) for the country\'s crushing debt and the </p><p>current strict economic program.  Initially sympathetic to </p><p>the U.S.\'s war on terrorism, most of them have since come to </p><p>believe that the operations directed against Afghanistan and, </p><p>now, Iraq are heavy-handed personal American vendettas and </p><p>perhaps even anti-Islamic in nature.  They feel that the U.S. </p><p>has its priorities confused (i.e., Iraq before </p><p>Israel/Palestine) and is bent on pursuing its goals </p><p>unilaterally with little regard for international, and </p><p>particularly Turkish, opinion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Comment: Our contacts in Istanbul, like embassy </p><p>contacts elsewhere in the country, have never been fond of </p><p>Saddam Hussein; most recognize that he represents a threat to </p><p>regional stability, and many even admit that he probably does </p><p>have biological and/or chemical weapons.  Nonetheless, there </p><p>is a strong, widespread Turkish desire to preserve stability </p><p>in the region - critical for Turkey\'s economic and political </p><p>development.  Much of the opposition to an operation against </p><p>Iraq rests with our contacts\' pessimistic predictions of the </p><p>duration of hostilities, an unstable post-war power vacuum, </p><p>and the possible disintegration of the Iraqi state into </p><p>several components, including a Kurdish north.  CONGEN </p><p>reassurances -- that we would prefer a peaceful solution to </p><p>war, that we will continue to seek wide international support </p><p>for any necessary military operation, that we are committed </p><p>to Iraqi territorial integrity and long-term regional </p><p>stability, and that we are prepared to help Turkey weather </p><p>the negative economic shocks of a war -- have gone a long way </p><p>towards addressing these concerns.  Continued multilateral </p><p>diplomacy and public diplomacy efforts to address these basic </p><p>concerns will be critical to winning the Turkish public\'s </p><p>support for our goals in Iraq.  End Comment. </p><p>ARNETT </p><p></p></div>
