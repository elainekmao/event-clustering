<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001156 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/18/2011 </p><p>TAGS: PHUM, SOCI, NI, UNHRC-1 </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIAN RESPONSE TO WCAR DEMARCHE (ROUND TWO) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: (A) STATE 086714 (B) ABUJA 0967 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA Andrews, reason 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) In the absence of the Charge from Abuja, Acting </p><p>Polcouns delivered the World Conference Against Racism (WCAR) </p><p>demarche on the proposed language on the Middle East for the </p><p>WCAR Declaration.  A/Polcouns spoke with Olusegun Akinsanya, </p><p>Director of the UN 2nd Unit (which among other matters, </p><p>handles human rights issues), and, separately, with Christy </p><p>Mbonu, Minister-Counselor in the UN 2nd Unit, who generally </p><p>takes the lead on human rights issues.  While Mrs. Mbonu was </p><p>non-committal on the demarche, requesting time to review the </p><p>talking points and speak with her colleagues, Mr. Akinsanya </p><p>was both more forthcoming and more sympathetic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U) Akinsanya broadly agreed on the need to avoid </p><p>distracting and polarizing issues.  "We want to focus on the </p><p>main themes of the conference," he said.  While stressing his </p><p>own wish to review the "harmonized" language of the draft </p><p>Declaration (which he believed might have already dispensed </p><p>with the proposed Middle East language), he said that </p><p>"extraneous" items should be avoided.  "There are more </p><p>important problems and more fundamental issues to address," </p><p>he emphasized. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (U)  Unfortunately from the USG perspective, these </p><p>"fundamental" discussions, according to Akinsanya, should </p><p>include reparations and restitution for colonial-era slavery. </p><p> In this he echoed the sentiments of Mrs. Mbonu in our </p><p>earlier demarche (REF B). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Akinsanya finished by stating he would "study" our </p><p>talking points, and looked forward to exploring the issues </p><p>with the USG delegation at the May 21 PrepComm in Geneva.  He </p><p>will not be accompanied by Mrs. Mbonu, probably a plus for </p><p>us, given her sometimes doctrinaire attitude on human rights </p><p>issues of concern to NAM and G-77 nations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment.  While the Nigerians may well support us on </p><p>the Middle East language issue, when it comes to the question </p><p>of reparations/restitution for colonial-era slavery, for </p><p>domestic political reasons as well as notions of solidarity </p><p>with other African and third world countries, the GON may </p><p>prove rather intransigent.  End comment. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
