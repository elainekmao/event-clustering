<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 05 YEKATERINBURG 0043 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p> </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, RS </p><p>SUBJECT:  THE SUPREMACY OF "STATE POWERS" </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A) 95 YEKATERINBURG 74 B) 96 YEKATERINBURG 72 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  THE LOCAL CONFLICT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR OF SVERDLOVSK </p><p>AND THE MAYOR OF YEKATERINBURG IS MORE THAN A PERSONAL </p><p>DISPUTE, REVEALING AS IT DOES A FUNDAMENTAL RUSSIAN </p><p>DISTINCTION BETWEEN "STATE POWERS" AND "LOCAL SELF- </p><p>ADMINISTRATION" THAT IS OFTEN LOST IN TRANSLATION.  FROM </p><p>THIS PERSPECTIVE, DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS AT THE MUNICIPAL </p><p>LEVEL DO NOT CONFER A LEGITIMACY TO EXECUTE MANY OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS WE TAKE FOR GRANTED.  THE LATTER </p><p>ARE CONSIDERED "STATE POWERS," INHERENT TO THE FEDERAL AND </p><p>OBLAST LEVELS, BUT ONLY DELEGATED TO MUNICIPALITIES AT THE </p><p>PLEASURE OF THE "STATE."  MANY REPUBLICS AND OBLASTS IN </p><p>EFFECT VIEW THE DEVOLUTION OF THE FORMERLY CENTRALIZED </p><p>"STATE POWERS" FROM MOSCOW TO THEM AS SIMPLY MULTIPLYING </p><p>THE NUMBER OF "KREMLINS" IN EXISTENCE, NOT CHANGING THE </p><p>NATURE OF THIS POWER OR GIVING IT TO THE PEOPLE.  THE </p><p>MUNICIPALITIES ARE CONTESTING THIS CONCEPT, BUT ARE </p><p>USUALLY PLAYING FROM A WEAKER HAND.  THE OUTCOME OF THIS </p><p>STRUGGLE WILL TO A LARGE PART DETERMINE THE FATE OF TRUE </p><p>DEMOCRACY IN RUSSIA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>A MISLEADING PREMISE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE ONGOING DECENTRALIZATION OF POWER FROM MOSCOW IS </p><p>OFTEN SEEN AS A CONTINUING RIPPLE THAT IS FINALLY REACHING </p><p>TO THE LOWEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.  THE PROCESS OF </p><p>ELECTING OFFICIALS AT EVERY LEVEL IS OFTEN ASSUMED TO BE </p><p>SOMEWHAT IN ACCORD WITH THE AMERICAN VIEW THAT GOVERNMENT </p><p>AUTHORITY SHOULD REST AT THE LOWEST LEVEL POSSIBLE, WHERE </p><p>THE ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE MOST RESPONSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE. </p><p>THE RUSSIAN FEDERAL AND OBLAST LAWS PROVIDING FOR THIS </p><p>LOCAL DEMOCRACY USE THE TERM "MESTNO-SAMOUPRAVLENIYE," </p><p>WHICH IS PRECISELY TRANSLATED AS "LOCAL SELF- </p><p>ADMINISTRATION" BUT OFTEN MISTAKENLY ASSUMED TO MEAN </p><p>"LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT," A VERY DIFFERENT THING INDEED. </p><p> </p><p>3.  MANY OF THE BASIC PREMISES OF THE ABOVE RUSSIAN </p><p>CONCEPT OF GOVERNMENT ARE REFLECTED IN AMERICAN PRACTICE. </p><p>THE IDEA OF "STATE POWERS" WHICH DO NOT, INDEED CANNOT, </p><p>EXIST AT ALL THREE LEVELS OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT--FEDERAL, </p><p>STATE, AND LOCAL--IS SEEN IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO </p><p>RAISE ARMIES AND ORGANIZE THE MILITIA.  THE CONCEPT THAT </p><p>ALL MUNICIPALITIES ARE CONSTRUCTS OF STATE LEGISLATURES </p><p>IS ANOTHER SHARED PREMISE.  THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN ALMOST </p><p>EVERY CASE, HOWEVER, EVEN WHERE THE BASIC AMERICAN AND </p><p>RUSSIAN CONCEPTS ARE SIMILAR, IS THE FAR MORE SWEEPING </p><p>AUTHORITY ACCORDED TO THE UPPER LEVELS OF RUSSIAN </p><p>GOVERNMENT, NOT BECAUSE THE EXERCISE OF THIS AUTHORITY MAY </p><p>BE MORE EFFECTIVE THERE BUT BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE </p><p>AUTHORITY IS HELD TO COME FROM.  POLITICAL POWER IN RUSSIA </p><p>DOES NOT, AND NEVER HAS, ORIGINATED FROM THE BOTTOM, AS IN </p><p>THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE WHERE CITIES MAY PREDATE STATES </p><p>AND STATES PREDATE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  IN THE RUSSIAN </p><p>SENSE, ELECTIONS THUS DO NOT DELEGATE THE POWER INHERENT </p><p>IN THE PEOPLE TO THE VARIOUS LAYERS OF GOVERNMENT, BUT </p><p>MERELY CONFER A LEGITIMACY TO THE ELECTEES TO EXERCISE </p><p>CERTAIN "STATE POWERS" THAT ALREADY EXIST, INDEPENDENT OF </p><p>THE PEOPLE AND DERIVED FROM THE EXISTENCE OF STATE ITSELF. </p><p>IN THIS SENSE, THESE "STATE POWERS" DO NOT, AND CANNOT, </p><p>EXIST AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>THE SUPREMACY OF THE STATE </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  HISTORICALLY, MOSCOVY HAD DEVELOPED AS THE EXTREME </p><p>EXAMPLE OF THE CENTRALLY-ORGANIZED STATE.  THE CZAR WAS </p><p>NOT ONLY THE RULER OF HIS EMPIRE BUT ITS "GOSUDAR\'," OR </p><p>LITERAL "SOVEREIGN" OWNER, EXERCISING "GOSUDARSTVENNIYE </p><p>VLASTI" ("GOSVLASTI" FOR SHORT) OR "STATE POWERS."  THESE </p><p>POWERS REFLECTED THE AUTHORITY AND LEGITIMACY INHERENT IN </p><p>A SOLE PROPRIETOR, WHICH COULD NEITHER BE FURTHER DIVIDED </p><p>NOR ALIENATED AND WHICH DID NOT REPRESENT ANY AUTHORITY OR </p><p>LEGITIMACY CONFERRED UPON THE PROPRIETOR BY ANYONE ELSE. </p><p>THESE "STATE POWERS" HAD ONE ORIGIN, AND WERE LITERALLY </p><p>SOVEREIGN.  THE COMMUNIST STRUCTURE THAT FOLLOWED </p><p>EXHIBITED IN MANY RESPECTS THE SAME THEORETICAL AND </p><p>PRACTICAL SUPREMACY OF THE CENTER. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>THE TREND TOWARDS REGIONALIZATION OF "STATE POWERS" </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN SOMETHING NOT EXISTENT IN </p><p>RUSSIA SINCE THE TIME OF INDIVIDUAL PRINCIPALITIES OR THE </p><p>ANOMALOUS CITY-STATE OF NOVGOROD, I.E., AN INDEPENDENT </p><p>SOURCE OF "STATE POWERS" OUTSIDE OF THE CAPITAL, BE IT </p><p>MOSCOW OR ST. PETERSBURG.  THIS INITIALLY OCCURRED DE </p><p>FACTO, BUT HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED, IN MANY </p><p>CASES, DE JURE.  SVERDLOVSK OBLAST, FOR EXAMPLE, CLAIMS </p><p>"STATE POWERS" IN ITS CHARTER, AND POINTS TO THE </p><p>AGREEMENTS SIGNED BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>SVERDLOVSK OBLAST IN JANUARY 1996 AS A RECOGNITION OF ITS </p><p>SOVEREIGNTY BY MOSCOW.  IT CAN THUS LEGITIMATELY CLAIM </p><p>THAT IT ITSELF NOW HAS THE ATTRIBUTE OF "STATE POWERS" </p><p>FORMALLY ONLY HELD BY CZAR OR COMMUNIST CENTRAL COMMITTEE. </p><p>CURRENT RUSSIAN FEDERALISM, IN THIS SENSE, IS THE </p><p>REPRODUCTION OF THE FORMER CENTRALIZED "STATE POWERS" OF </p><p>THE KREMLIN IN THE EIGHTY-NINE "SUBJECTS OF THE RUSSIAN </p><p>FEDERATION," BE THEY OBLASTS, REPUBLICS, OR AUTONOMOUS </p><p>OKRUGS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  WHILE MOSCOW AND THE REPUBLICS OR OBLASTS, IN </p><p>ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANY AND VARIED TREATIES NOW SIGNED </p><p>BETWEEN THEM, MAY HAVE DIVIDED THESE "STATE POWERS" </p><p>BETWEEN THEM, THE REPUBLICS AND OBLASTS ARE NOT ABOUT TO </p><p>FURTHER DIVIDE IT WITH THE MUNICIPALITIES.  THEY WILL </p><p>DELEGATE CERTAIN "GOSUDARSTVENNIYE POLNOMOCHIYE" OR "STATE </p><p>PLENETARY POWERS" TO THE MUNICIPALITIES BY DECREE OF THE </p><p>GOVERNOR OR BY LAW OF THE OBLAST LEGISLATURE, BUT CAN </p><p>QUITE AS EASILY TAKE THEM AWAY.  "LOCAL SELF- </p><p>ADMINISTRATION," FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW, THUS DOES NOT </p><p>MEAN THAT THE SUBORDINATE MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ANY INHERENT </p><p>"STATE POWERS" OF THEIR OWN.  THE LATTER CAN MERELY USE </p><p>THEIR DISCRETION IN THE EXECUTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE </p><p>OBLAST\'S "STATE POWERS." </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>SVERDLOVSK\'S "KREMLIN" ON THE RIVER ISET </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN GOVERNOR EDUARD ROSSEL OF </p><p>SVERDLOVSK AND MAYOR ARKADIY CHERNETSKIY OF YEKATERINBURG </p><p>HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF PREVIOUS CABLES (REFTELS).  THIS </p><p>PREVIOUSLY HAD SEEMED TO US MORE OF A CONFLICT OF </p><p>PERSONALITIES THAN OF IDEOLOGIES, AS THEIR TWO PARTY </p><p>PROGRAMS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY SIMILAR.  IF ONE INCLUDES THE </p><p>CONCEPTUAL DISTINCTION NOTED ABOVE, HOWEVER, THE CONFLICT </p><p>TAKES ON A DIFFERENT, MUCH DEEPER NATURE.  THAT THIS </p><p>CONCEPT OF "STATE POWERS" IS INDEED DRIVING THE OBLAST IS </p><p>APPARENT IN A WHOLE SERIES OF RECENT ACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>8.  ONE ASPECT OF THIS DIVISION OF SOVEREIGNTY IS THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF MANY SENIOR FEDERAL OFFICIALS, WHO ARE </p><p>SUPPOSED TO BE NOMINATED BY THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES IN </p><p>AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR AND CONFIRMED BY THE OBLAST </p><p>LEGISLATURE.  (COMMENT: SHADES OF THE LONG STRUGGLE </p><p>BETWEEN SECULAR MONARCHS AND THE PAPACY OVER THE </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF BISHOPS.  END COMMENT)  THIS LIST INCLUDES </p><p>THE MVD CHIEF, AND LOTS OF GRUMBLING WAS RECENTLY HEARD IN </p><p>THE LEGISLATURE WHEN A DEPUTY MINISTER FROM MOSCOW CAME </p><p>OUT AND PRESENTED THE NEW OBLAST UVD HEAD BEFORE ANY VOTE </p><p>ON HIM WAS UNDERTAKEN IN THE OBLAST LEGISLATURE.  EVEN THE </p><p>FEDERAL OFFICIALS WHO CAN BE APPOINTED BY MOSCOW WITHOUT </p><p>REFERENCE TO THE OBLAST, SUCH AS THE MILITARY DISTRICT </p><p>COMMANDER OR THE FSB CHIEF, HAVE BEEN COOPTED BY BEING </p><p>INCORPORATED IN THE GOVERNOR\'S OWN "SECURITY COUNCIL." </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE OBLAST\'S CLAIM TO SOVEREIGNTY WAS CLEAR WHEN THE </p><p>DUMA PASSED A LAW, SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR ON 24 DECEMBER </p><p>1996, "ON THE CONFERRING OF DELEGATED STATE PLENETARY </p><p>POWERS TO THE ORGANS OF SELF-ADMINISTRATION OF MUNICIPAL </p><p>STRUCTURES IN SVERDLOVSK OBLAST," IN WHICH IT LAID OUT </p><p>EIGHT SPECIFIC AREAS IN WHICH THE MUNICIPALITIES CAN </p><p>PARTICIPATE WITH THE OBLAST IN PROGRAMS ON THE USE OF </p><p>LAND; THE USE OF MINERAL RIGHTS; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; </p><p>EDUCATION; CULTURE; PUBLIC HEAL; THTHE :  THE OBLAST </p><p>PROGRAM ON THE USE OF LAND;  . </p><p> </p><p>10.  PERTINENT EXAMPLES OF THIS LINE OF THINKING WERE </p><p>REVEALED IN THE OBLAST DUMA\'S DEBATE ON 17-18 FEBRUARY ON </p><p>THE LAW CREATING THE EASTERN "OKRUG," ONE OF THE SIX NEW </p><p>PREFECTURAL DISTRICTS LONG DESIRED BY THE GOVERNOR AS A </p><p>STATED MEANS OF BRINGING THE OBLAST ADMINISTRATION CLOSER </p><p>TO THE PEOPLE AND OF MAKING IT MORE EFFICIENT.  THE DRAFT </p><p>WAS SURPRISINGLY DEFEATED, WITH SOME LOCAL DEPUTIES SAYING </p><p>THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE AREA NEITHER UNDERSTOOD NOR FELT </p><p>THE NEED FOR SUCH A NEW BUREAUCRATIC ENTITY AND SUGGESTING </p><p>THAT A REFERENDUM SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.  THE SPEAKER OF </p><p>THE DUMA, VLACHESLAV SURGANOV, IN TURN STATED THAT THE </p><p>NEED FOR THIS NEW LEVEL OF OBLAST GOVERNMENT STEMMED FROM </p><p>THE FACT THAT THE "ORGANS OF LOCAL SELF-ADMINISTRATION DO </p><p>NOT CORRELATE THEIR ACTIVITIES WITH THE OBLAST </p><p>ADMINISTRATION AND SHOW TOO MUCH INITIATIVE." </p><p> </p><p>11.  THE REACH OF THE OBLAST POWERS WAS EVIDENCED IN THE </p><p>OPINIONS OF "REVIVAL OF THE URALS" DEPUTY VENIAMIN </p><p>GOLUBITSKIY, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DUMA COMMITTEE ON </p><p>ECONOMIC POLICY, BUDGET, FINANCES, AND TAXES, WHO SAID </p><p>THAT THE LAW WAS ABOUT "IMPROVING THE STRUCTURE OF THE </p><p>"UPRAVLENIYE" (DIRECTION OR ADMINISTRATION) OF THE OBLAST. </p><p>JUST AS WE (THE DUMA) DO NOT DISCUSS CONCRETE TASKS GIVEN </p><p>BY THE HEAD OF THE OBLAST TO HIS DEPUTIES BECAUSE THEY ARE </p><p>AN INTERNAL MATTER OF THE OBLAST, BY THE SAME TOKEN WE </p><p>SHOULD NOT DISCUSS THIS.  AND WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?  WE </p><p>ARE DISCUSSING THE \'POLNOMOCHIYE\' (AUTHORITY) WHICH THE </p><p>OBLAST ANYWAY POSSESS.  IT IS ONLY A QUESTION OF HOW THIS </p><p>\'POLNOMOCHIYE\' MATERIALIZES."  (COMMENT:  THE HEAD OF THE </p><p>DUMA BUDGET COMMITTEE CANNOT BE TALKING ABOUT THE CREATION </p><p>OF GOVERNMENT POSITIONS, SINCE HE HAS TO PAY FOR THEM, AND </p><p>LOGICALLY CAN ONLY MEAN THE AUTHORITY INHERENT IN THE </p><p>GOVERNOR\'S POSSESSION OF "STATE POWERS."  END COMMENT.) </p><p>GOLUBITSKIY THOUGHT THE PROPOSED IDEA OF A REFERENDUM ON </p><p>THE NEW PREFECTURAL DISTRICT RIDICULOUS, SINCE THE PEOPLE </p><p>WERE UNINFORMED ON SUCH ISSUES. </p><p> </p><p>12.  THE NORTHERN PREFECTURE HAS ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED, </p><p>AND A GUBERNATORIAL DECREE WAS ISSUED STATING THAT ITS </p><p>STAFF WOULD CONSIST OF 49 PERSONNEL, TO BE TRANSFERRED </p><p>FROM THE STAFFS OF THE MUNICIPALITIES CONTAINED THEREIN. </p><p>WHEN THE CG ASKED YEKATERINBURG MAYOR CHERNETSKIY HOW THE </p><p>GOVERNOR COULD SO TRANSFER MUNICIPAL PERSONNEL, THE MAYOR </p><p>REPLIED "HE CAN\'T.."  ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE OBLAST </p><p>EXECUTIVE\'S EXERCISE OF "STATE POWERS" IN THE PERSONNEL </p><p>AREA WAS A GUBERNATORIAL DECREE DECLARING THAT THE HEADS </p><p>OF AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENTS OF MUNICIPALITIES AND RAIONS, </p><p>CLEARLY ORGANS OF LOCAL SELF-ADMINISTRATION, WERE NO </p><p>LONGER TO BE APPOINTED BY THE ELECTED MAYORS OR RAION </p><p>HEADS OF ADMINISTRATION, BUT BY THE GOVERNOR. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF THIS THINKING IS THE OBLAST </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S DRAFT OF A LAW ON THE STATUS OF YEKATERINBURG </p><p>AS THE OBLAST CAPITAL.  MAYOR CHERNETSKIY, AS A MEMBER OF </p><p>THE LEGISLATURE, SUBMITTED HIS OWN VERSION.  THE DUMA </p><p>COMMITTEE CONSIDERING THESE TWO VERSIONS HAS PRODUCED A </p><p>COMPROMISE, NOTING THAT IT USED CHERNETSKIY\'S DRAFT AS THE </p><p>MORE WORKABLE BASIS.  THE GOVERNOR\'S REPRESENTATIVE TO THE </p><p>DUMA HAS HOWEVER DECLARED THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL NOT </p><p>ACCEPT ANY COMPROMISE. </p><p> </p><p>14.  THE KEY ITEM IN THE GOVERNOR\'S PROPOSAL IS THAT, </p><p>BECAUSE OF YEKATERINBURG\'S STATUS AS THE "ADMINISTRATIVE </p><p>CENTER OF THE OBLAST," ITS MAYOR SHOULD BE PROPOSED BY THE </p><p>GOVERNOR AND ELECTED BY THE CITY DUMA.  IN ADDITION, THIS </p><p>STATUS MEANS THAT MANY OF THE FUNCTIONS NORMALLY ASCRIBED </p><p>TO LOCAL SELF-ADMINISTRATION MUST NOW BE CONSIDERED AS </p><p>"STATE POWERS," TO BE EXECUTED BY THE EXECUTIVE ORGAN OF </p><p>THE "CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE DISTRICT." </p><p> </p><p>15.  CHERNETSKIY HAS ALSO BEEN UNDER ATTACK OF LATE BY A </p><p>NUMBER OF THE OFFICIALS AND DUMA MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNOR\'S </p><p>PARTY FOR BEING TOO CONCERNED ABOUT POLITICS AND NOT </p><p>PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THE GOOD HUSBANDRY OF THE CITY. </p><p>(COMMENT:  THIS IDEA THAT THE MAYOR SHOULD BE A NON- </p><p>POLITICAL FIGURE IS A CLEAR CONFIRMATION OF THE </p><p>SUBORDINATE ROLE FORESEEN FOR THE ORGANS OF LOCAL SELF- </p><p>ADMINISTRATION, HOLDING AS IT DOES THAT POLITICS IS </p><p>SOMETHING APPROPRIATE ONLY AT THE OBLAST LEVEL, THE TRUE </p><p>REPOSITORY OF POLITICAL POWER.  THE DE FACTO REALITY OF </p><p>THIS, FELT BY VOTERS IN THEIR BONES, MAY WELL ACCOUNT FOR </p><p>THE LATTER\'S RELATIVE INDIFFERENCE TO MANY ELECTIONS AT </p><p>THE LOCAL LEVEL.   END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p>UDMURTIA\'S "KREMLIN" ON THE RIVER IZH </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>16.  THE UDMURT REPUBLIC IS GOVERNED BY A "GOSSOVIET," OR </p><p>STATE SOVIET, THE CHAIRMAN OF WHICH, ALEXANDR A. VOLKOV </p><p>SERVES AS THE HEAD OF THE REPUBLIC GOVERNMENT.  THE STATE </p><p>SOVIET ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF "STATE POWERS" </p><p>AND "LOCAL SELF-ADMINISTRATION" IN APRIL 1996 BY SIMPLY </p><p>PASSING A LAW ABOLISHING THE POSITIONS OF THE ELECTED </p><p>MAYORS.  ALL OF THESE MAYORS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF </p><p>ANATOLIY I. SALTYKOV, THE MAYOR OF THE CAPITAL, ISHEVSK, </p><p>ACCEPTED THE LAW AND BECAME GOVERNMENT-APPOINTED </p><p>OFFICIALS.  DURING THE CG\'S VISIT TO UDMURTIA LAST </p><p>NOVEMBER, THERE WERE THUS TWO MAYORS OF ISHEVSK, THE OLD </p><p>POPULARLY-ELECTED ONE, SALTYKOV, AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT- </p><p>APPOINTED ONE, YURIY S. PITKEVICH, WITH THE CITY </p><p>GOVERNMENT AT A STANDSTILL.  VOLKOV AND PITKEVICH, OVER </p><p>THE USUAL SUMPTUOUS LUNCH, ATTEMPTED TO CONVINCE THE CG </p><p>THAT DEMOCRACY HAD TO BE ESTABLISHED ONLY SLOWLY IN THE </p><p>REPUBLIC, AND THAT THE UDMURT POPULATION WAS ONLY READY TO </p><p>ELECT OFFICIALS AT THE SUB-MUNICIPAL LEVEL.  THE SMALL </p><p>SIZE OF THE REPUBLIC, AND THE DOMINANT POSITION OF </p><p>ISHEVSK, MEANT THAT A UNIFIED GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO THE </p><p>NECESSARY DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY WAS IMPOSSIBLE WITH </p><p>AN ELECTED MAYOR IN THE CAPITAL WHO PURSUED HIS OWN </p><p>POLICIES. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>THE CITIES FIGHT BACK </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>17.  THIS VIEW OF THE SUPREMACY OF THE REPUBLICS AND </p><p>OBLASTS IS NOT SURPRISINGLY REJECTED BY MUNICIPAL LEADERS, </p><p>WHO ARE SEEKING REAL GOVERNMENTAL POWER.  SALTYKOV TOOK </p><p>THE UDMURT REPUBLIC TO THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN </p><p>NOVEMBER, AND EFFECTIVELY WON THE CASE AT THE END OF </p><p>JANUARY.  WHILE THE COURT AGREED THAT THE REPUBLIC HAD THE </p><p>RIGHT TO STRUCTURE THE LOCAL ORGANS OF SELF-ADMINISTRATION </p><p>ANY WAY IT WISHED, INCLUDING HAVING APPOINTED HEADS OF </p><p>ADMINISTRATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, IT STIPULATED THAT ONCE </p><p>THE PEOPLE OF THESE LOCAL ENTITIES HAD EXPRESSED THE </p><p>POPULAR WILL THROUGH ELECTIONS FOR THE THEIR MAYORS OR </p><p>HEADS OF ADMINISTRATION, FUTURE CHANGES COULD ONLY BE </p><p>EFFECTED THROUGH POPULAR WILL.  THE EXISTING POSITIONS </p><p>COULD THUS ONLY BE ABOLISHED BY A REFERENDUM, NOT BY ANY </p><p>ACTION OF THE STATE COUNCIL. (COMMENT:  THIS CAVEAT WAS SO </p><p>HARD TO DISCERN FROM THE REPUBLIC-CONTROLLED MEDIA THAT </p><p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT LATER HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE TO </p><p>"CLARIFY" THE OFFICIAL REPUBLIC INTERPRETATION.  END </p><p>COMMENT)  THE STATE COUNCIL IN UDMURTIA IS NOW LOOKING AT </p><p>HOLDING REFERENDUMS ON ABOLISHING THE OFFICES OF ELECTED </p><p>MAYORS, AND APPEARS TO BE CONFIDENT THAT IT COULD WIN IN </p><p>MOST CASES. </p><p> </p><p>18.  THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT\'S DECISION WAS SEEN AS A </p><p>GREAT VICTORY BY THE CITY OF YEKATERINBURG.  ONE OF ITS </p><p>DEPUTY MAYORS, ALEXANDR G. KOBERNICHENKO, COMMENTED TO THE </p><p>CG THAT THE DECISION HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED JUST BEFORE A </p><p>MEETING OF THE "UNION OF CITIES OF RUSSIA" ATTENDED BY </p><p>CHERNOMRYDIN AND CHUBAIS.  KOBERNICHENKO NOTED THAT THE </p><p>UNION, WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION OF THE LARGER CITIES OF </p><p>RUSSIA, IS APPARENTLY NOW BEING SEEN BY THE CENTER AS A </p><p>USEFUL ALLY.  ITS MEMBERS CONTAIN SOME 48 PERCENT OF THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S VOTERS AND, UNLIKE MANY OF THE OBLAST GOVERNORS </p><p>AND REPUBLIC HEADS, THE CITY HEADS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN </p><p>BRINGING ABOUT ANY GREAT DIMINUTION OF THE AUTHORITY OF </p><p>THE FEDERATION.  IN ANY GIVEN INSTANCE, HOWEVER, THE </p><p>CITIES ARE GENERALLY PLAYING THE WEAKER HAND.  IN </p><p>YEKATERINBURG, THE MAYOR HAS TO CONTINUALLY FEND OFF </p><p>ATTACKS INITIATED BY THE OBLAST, INCLUDING SUCH EXTREMES </p><p>AS THE GOVERNOR\'S SECURITY COUNCIL INVESTIGATION OF THE </p><p>CITY TELEPHONE RATES IN THE NAME OF "ECONOMIC SECURITY." </p><p></p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>19.  THE OUTCOME OF THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER BETWEEN THE </p><p>OBLASTS AND REPUBLICS AND THE MUNICIPALITIES AND THEIR </p><p>EQUIVALENT RAIONS, MOST CLEARLY REPRESENTED IN SVERDLOVSK </p><p>AND UDMURTIA BUT ONGOING IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IN MOST OF </p><p>THE SUBJECTS OF THE FEDERATION IN OUR CONSULAR DISTRICT, </p><p>WILL HAVE A DECISIVE EFFECT ON THE EVOLUTION OF A REAL </p><p>DEMOCRACY IN THE REGION.  IF THE CONCEPT OF THE SUPREMACY </p><p>OF "STATE POWERS" PREVAILS, THE LOCUS OF POWER MAY HAVE </p><p>CHANGED BUT ITS NATURE WILL BASICALLY REFLECT THE </p><p>CENTURIES-OLD CONCEPT OF A SOCIETY RUN FROM THE TOP DOWN. </p><p>THE VIEW FROM THE URALS IS THAT, IN THIS RESPECT, ONE </p><p>OUGHT TO BE ROOTING FOR THE MUNICIPALITIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STEERS </p><p></p></div>
