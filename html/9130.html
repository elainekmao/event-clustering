<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 SANAA 001586 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR L/LEI, S/CT, DOJ FOR DAAG BRUCE SWARTZ, </p><p>RIYADH FOR LEGATT </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KJUS, PTER, ASEC, MARR, PARM, PGOV, GM, YM, COUNTER TERRORISM, TERFIN </p><p>SUBJECT: FM QIRBI AND AMBASSADOR DISCUSS PALESTINIAN </p><p>ASSISTANCE, AL-MOAYED AND OTHER ISSUES </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. SECSTATE 181245 </p><p>     B. SANAA 1544 </p><p>     C. SANAA 1455 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  Summary:  The Ambassador called on Foreign Minister </p><p>Qirbi July 2 upon the FM\'s return from Germany and France. </p><p>He urged increased assistance to the Palestinian Authority </p><p>per reftel A.  They discussed the al-Moayed case, current </p><p>Coast Guard training in Aden, the impressive role of the </p><p>U.S.-trained Central Security Forces (CSF) in the Abyan </p><p>operation (ref B) and other topics.  The Ambassador also met </p><p>with Qirbi one-on-one to discuss terrorist financing </p><p>(septel).  A/DCM and Acting Pol/Econ Chief accompanied the </p><p>Ambassador.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p>Middle East Peace Negotiations:  Secretary\'s Message </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Ambassador delivered Secretary\'s message in reftel </p><p>A.  He also highlighted the encouraging progress recently and </p><p>the ongoing U.S. high-level engagement.  Qirbi responded that </p><p>there was a dispute between the ROYG and the Arab League </p><p>regarding Yemen\'s assessment.  Before unification in 1990, </p><p>North Yemen and South Yemen each contributed 1% of the Arab </p><p>League budget, for a total of 2%.  After 1990, the ROYG </p><p>maintained that its proper assessment is still 1% while the </p><p>Arab League maintains 2%.  Assistance to Palestine is based </p><p>on the Arab League assessment.  Hence, the ROYG feels it has </p><p>fully paid while the Arab League considers it only 50% paid. </p><p>The Ambassador said that this was not a usual time in the </p><p>peace process, progress was becoming possible and the ROYG </p><p>should increase its contribution regardless of any dispute. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The Ambassador cautioned Qirbi on contributions to </p><p>Hamas and other radical Palestinian groups, noting that the </p><p>ROYG needs to make sure that contributions, both official and </p><p>non-official, go to the right place.  Ambassador said that </p><p>contributions are vitally needed to buttress Abu Mazen and </p><p>other legitimate charity groups such as the Red Crescent </p><p>Society.  Qirbi said it was a contentious issue, saying that </p><p>Hamas had recently showed flexibility and "we need to exert </p><p>pressure" on them to support Abu Mazen.  He referenced a </p><p>British House of Commons report that claimed that 80-90% of </p><p>Hamas funding was used for legitimate charity.  Qirbi said </p><p>the impetus should be on how to influence its military wing </p><p>to stop attacks. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Qirbi noted that Yemen has established a committee </p><p>to handle official and public contributions for the </p><p>Palestinians, headed by Deputy Prime Minister (and </p><p>MinFinance) al-Salami and composed of NGO representatives and </p><p>ROYG officials.  This committee has already changed emphasis </p><p>to increased aid to the PA, therefore reducing contributions </p><p>to Hamas.  The Ambassador said he would discuss this issue </p><p>with the Deputy PM and encouraged the ROYG to study further </p><p>efforts to give Abu Mazen the strongest possible hand. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p>President Saleh\'s visit to Germany -- al-Moayed </p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C)  The Ambassador and FM discussed the upcoming </p><p>resolution to the al-Moayed case in Germany, including the </p><p>timing of extradition and the potential appeals process.  The </p><p>Ambassador noted that we need to work together on managing </p><p>public sentiment at extradition, particularly regarding </p><p>security issues.  Qirbi agreed that the "security, public </p><p>responses and political impact" should be discussed and </p><p>managed.  Qirbi said he did not know if an appeals process </p><p>was beneficial or not, but noted that delaying the </p><p>extradition would "give us a chance to work out a mechanism" </p><p>by which al-Moayed can cooperate and give information.  He </p><p>said that Yemen needs to be convinced of his culpability, and </p><p>wondered if the Yemeni people would accept the situation </p><p>otherwise if the case was not made. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>Coast Guard Training in Aden; </p><p>Central Security Forces (CSF) </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  The Ambassador informed Qirbi about the Coast Guard </p><p>training in Aden, noting its importance as part of ongoing CT </p><p>cooperation.  He also congratulated Qirbi on the performance </p><p>of the U.S.-trained CSF forces in the Abyan operation (ref B) </p><p>and the visit by CSF commander to Tampa and Washington in </p><p>August. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>Other Issues:  U/S Bolton Visit; Car Exemptions; </p><p>Ambassador\'s Washington Consultations </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C)  The Ambassador thanked Qirbi for meeting with </p><p>UnderSecretary Bolton June 17 (ref C).  He said it was a </p><p>productive visit, particularly the discussions on Article 98 </p><p>and the DPRK.  Qirbi expressed appreciation when the </p><p>Ambassador informed him of the recent release of humanitarian </p><p>demining funds as a tangible result of the UnderSecretary\'s </p><p>visit.  A/DCM mentioned that he was working the issue of car </p><p>exemptions with the MFA head of protocol, where several </p><p>armored and regular vehicles were being held up in </p><p>bureaucratic delays.  Qirbi indicated that he expected the </p><p>issue to be expedited.  The Ambassador briefed Qirbi on his </p><p>recent Washington consultations.  He told Qirbi that he </p><p>discussed his idea of a strategic dialogue with Washington </p><p>officials, and that the suggestion was to focus on a </p><p>substantive agenda. The Ambassador suggested two important </p><p>topics, arms flows and money flows, and suggested they </p><p>discuss it further. </p><p>HULL </p><p></p></div>
