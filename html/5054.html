<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 000065 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>FOR WHA/PDA,(MBUCKLEY, MPROCTOR, WWANLUND); IIP/G/WHA </p><p>DIPASQUALE; PA/OBS/P (DSCHACKNER); EB/EPPD DCLUNE, </p><p>MDEUTSCHER; USTR AGASH </p><p>EMBASSIES FOR PAOS, IOs </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OPRC, KPAO, OIIP, HO, ETRD, USTR </p><p>SUBJECT: EVALUATION OF AETN DIALOGUE ON "WTO AGRICULTURAL </p><p>INITITATIVE" - JANUARY 08, 2003, 1800-1900 UTC </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Description of the activity: A one-hour interactive AETN </p><p>Dialogue on the "WTO Agricultural Initiative." </p><p> </p><p>2.  Date: January 8, 2003; Fiscal year: FY-03, QTR 1 </p><p> </p><p>3.  Objective:  To provide the local media an opportunity to </p><p>discuss the issues of the new U.S. Agricultural Initiative </p><p>with Alan Larson, Under Secretary for Economic, Business and </p><p>Agricultural Affairs, and Ambassador Allen F. Johnson, Chief </p><p>Agriculture Negotiator for the Office of the U.S Trade </p><p>Representative (USTR). </p><p> </p><p>4.  MPP Goal: Regional Economic Development </p><p> </p><p>5.  Audience reached: 30 guests, including Honduran media, </p><p>the trade advisor for the Central American Economic </p><p>Integration Agency (SIECA), and USAID and Economic officers. </p><p> </p><p>6.  Result/Impact: Excellent. The program met post\'s </p><p>objective of providing an opportunity for the media to focus </p><p>attention on the U.S. agricultural initiative and making a </p><p>pitch for Honduras to become active in WTO initiatives to </p><p>remove subsidies. The local media responded with enthusiasm </p><p>and the program received excellent press coverage. We expect </p><p>to see more reports this week. </p><p> </p><p>7. The panelists were Sammy Castro, economic journalist from </p><p>the daily "El Heraldo;" Leonila Madrid, economic journalist </p><p>from a leading TV news program, "Abriendo Brecha;" and </p><p>Sandra Moreno from the nightly news program, "Telenoticias". </p><p> </p><p>Tegucigalpa\'s participation in the January 8th AETN dialogue </p><p>on subsidy reductions with U/S Larson and Johnson served to </p><p>explain the importance to WTO negotiations of achieving </p><p>subsidy reductions and alerted the media to the historic </p><p>importance of the launch of CAFTA negotiations in </p><p>Washington. </p><p> </p><p>Ambassador Johnson and U/S Larson\'s strong pitch for </p><p>Honduras to become active in the WTO initiatives to remove </p><p>subsidies grabbed the attention of the reporters covering </p><p>the AETN dialogue. "La Tribuna" carried banner headline: </p><p>"United States seeks to eliminate subsidies"; daily "Tiempo" </p><p>headlined:" CAFTA negotiations will bump agricultural </p><p>products". The AETN program appeared on major Honduran </p><p>national television news programs. Abriendo Brecha and </p><p>Telenoticias\' nightly news gave full coverage to the AETN </p><p>dialog with Larson and Johnson. Other national news programs </p><p>including TV-11, TV-63 and Radio HRN (nation-wide) provided </p><p>excellent coverage of the program. </p><p> </p><p>After the AETN dialogue was over, journalists took the </p><p>opportunity to interview USAID Agricultural Officer Raymond </p><p>Waldron and Director of Economic Development Programs Duty </p><p>Green and Alvaro Sarmiento, trade advisor for the Central </p><p>American Economic Integration Agency (SIECA). </p><p>Both USAID Officers pointed out the success Honduras has had </p><p>in developing new products for export to the US. Sarmiento </p><p>stressed the importance of the integration and harmonization </p><p>of standards and laws governing export products. This </p><p>discussion focused on the issues raised by the AETN dialogue </p><p>and the relationship of these issues to the CAFTA launch. </p><p>The three panelists here in Honduras energetically supported </p><p>the AETN panelists by emphasizing the importance of </p><p>Honduras\' supporting the US position at the WTO on subsidy </p><p>reductions. </p><p> </p><p>PAS provided a copy of the AETN dialogue to the Minister of </p><p>Agriculture, the Minister of Commerce, the Honduran </p><p>Counselor for Private Enterprise (COHEP), the Animal and </p><p>Plant Health Inspection Service (SENASA), and the Inter- </p><p>American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA). </p><p> </p><p>8.  Non-USG sources of funding:  None </p><p> </p><p>9.  Quality of USG support:  Excellent.  Post would like to </p><p>thank EB/EPPD Daniel Clune and Martha Deutscher, WHA/PDA </p><p>Martha Buckley and William Wanlund, and PA/OBS/P Debra </p><p>Schackner for this initiative and for facilitating a </p><p>flawless program. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer. </p><p></p></div>
