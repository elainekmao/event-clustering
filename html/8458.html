<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 NASSAU 001066 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/30/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, BF, Bahamian Politics </p><p>SUBJECT: POWERS BEHIND THE THRONE IN THE PLP GOVERNMENT - </p><p>PROTIGIS OF THE                    COUNTRY\'S FIRST PRIME </p><p>MINISTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert M. Witajeski, Reason 1.5 (B) and </p><p>(D). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) In two separate meetings May 27 and 28, DCM and </p><p>POL/ECON section chief met the two individuals outside of the </p><p>Bahamian government considered to have the most influence on </p><p>Prime Minister Perry Christie\'s government.  Wealthy </p><p>businessman Frankie Wilson, a prominent campaign contributor </p><p>and friend of the Prime Minister\'s, offered us a spirited </p><p>defense of the former Pindling administration\'s drug record, </p><p>gave his perspective on various recent ambassadors, and </p><p>defended the Christie administration\'s record of inaction by </p><p>saying repeatedly, "But you have to understand where we have </p><p>come from."  Bishop Neil Ellis, the controversial pastor of a </p><p>large evangelical church whom Christie refers to as his </p><p>"spiritual adviser", expressed his desire for closer </p><p>relations with the Embassy, bemoaned his treatment in the </p><p>press, and offered a fascinating intimate account of how he </p><p>came to publicly endorse Christie in the last election.  Both </p><p>power brokers humbly -- and unconvincingly -- denied having </p><p>or wanting any real influence.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Frankie Wilson </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Frankie Wilson is The Bahamas\' most prominent, and </p><p>probably wealthiest, black businessman.  The owner of Arawak </p><p>Homes and Sunshine Insurance Company, as well as many other </p><p>businesses, is an original member of the "Sunshine Group", a </p><p>group of black businessmen who were actively supported by </p><p>former Prime Minister Sir Lynden Pindling as they created </p><p>their empires in the 1970s and 1980s.  Pindling supported </p><p>them as a way to break the economic power held by the "Bay </p><p>Street Boys" (the country\'s traditional white elite), who </p><p>with the support of the United Bahamas Party (UBP) had ruled </p><p>The Bahamas both politically and economically for decades </p><p>until majority rule arrived in 1967.  Wilson is very proud of </p><p>his rise to meteoric wealth and, during the course of the </p><p>meeting, repeatedly referred to his humble past, when, as the </p><p>youngest of 11 children in a working class family, he had to </p><p>sleep on the floor until his older sisters grew up and moved </p><p>out of the house and a bed opened up for him.  He is </p><p>fanatically devoted to Pindling, who identified him, became </p><p>his godfather, and opened the doors that allowed Wilson to be </p><p>successful.  That loyalty has transferred to Pindling\'s </p><p>Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), and today Wilson is a major </p><p>financial contributor to the party and close adviser to Prime </p><p>Minister Perry Christie.  In fact, when we arrived, Wilson </p><p>summoned his own son and Perry Christie\'s son (both of whom </p><p>work for him) into the office for the meeting.  Wilson, who </p><p>served for the PLP in Parliament from 1992-1997, was defeated </p><p>in 1997, has declined to take several positions offered to </p><p>him by the Pindling administration, insisting they would take </p><p>too much time from his business concerns. </p><p> </p><p>Pindling the Hero </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Wilson, a bombastic speaker who frequently cuts </p><p>others off in conversation, spent much of the hour and half </p><p>meeting offering a passionate defense of the record of Sir </p><p>Lynden Pindling.  He insisted that allegations of narcotics </p><p>corruption against Pindling were completely unfounded and </p><p>claimed that the Commission of Inquiry bore him out on this </p><p>point.  He brushed aside questions about how Sir Lynden had </p><p>amassed his obvious wealth during his years in office and the </p><p>influence of notorious Colombian narcotics kingpin Carlos </p><p>Lehder, and said that the stories about Pindling were the </p><p>result of jealousy and ingratitude, a plot orchestrated by </p><p>former U.S. Ambassador Carol Boyd Hallett and former Prime </p><p>Minister Hubert Ingraham who "wouldn\'t have been anything </p><p>without Pindling."  Wilson claimed "no one has cooperated </p><p>more" with the U.S. on drug interdiction than Pindling, and </p><p>said that seizure statistics bear him out on this assertion. </p><p>He expressed great scorn toward Hubert Ingraham for betraying </p><p>Pindling and then setting out to destroy his reputation after </p><p>Ingraham became Prime Minister, which Wilson claimed </p><p>destroyed Pindling\'s health and led to his death (this is </p><p>also the opinion of Lady Pindling, Sir Lynden\'s widow). </p><p>Wilson said that only when Pindling neared his death did </p><p>Ingraham "repent" and seek reconciliation with Pindling on </p><p>the latter\'s death bed.  Wilson claimed that the impressive </p><p>sendoff given to Pindling by Ingraham\'s government when he </p><p>died in 2000 was proof that Ingraham felt "remorseful" about </p><p>what he had done to Pindling\'s reputation.  (Ingraham would </p><p>say that the impressive funeral was appropriate for the man </p><p>who, whatever his faults, was the country\'s "founding </p><p>father", and that the kind words offered by Ingraham then </p><p>were simply an example of not speaking poorly of the dead.) </p><p>Wilson believes that the seeds of the PLP\'s 2002 election </p><p>victory were laid at that funeral, as the state ceremony and </p><p>effusive eulogies allowed the PLP to escape from its image of </p><p>corruption. </p><p> </p><p>Wilson\'s Take on Diplomacy </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  Wilson offered his opinion on the performance of </p><p>former U.S. ambassadors here.  He singled out Ambassador </p><p>Carol Hallett for scorn, blaming her for demonizing Pindling </p><p>and dragging his reputation through the mud.  He said that </p><p>she "played the game" politically and was very shrewd, but </p><p>that he despised her for her actions.  Wilson alleged that </p><p>she interfered directly in Bahamian internal politics for </p><p>reasons he failed to understand, offering tangible support to </p><p>Hubert Ingraham and the FNM - support Wilson claims they </p><p>could not have won the election without.  He reserved his </p><p>highest praise for Ambassador Sydney Williams, saying that he </p><p>had a quiet style and didn\'t make waves.  Wilson said that </p><p>Bahamians prefer that style of diplomacy, and do not like </p><p>confrontation. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Wilson also pleaded with us to engage constructively </p><p>with The Bahamas and support Foreign Minister Mitchell\'s </p><p>desire to play a more prominent role on the world stage.  He </p><p>said that, as a country with shared democratic and capitalist </p><p>values, the Bahamas could help the United States a good deal </p><p>in international fora, and that the U.S. should take </p><p>advantage of that. </p><p> </p><p>"To Understand Where We Are, You Have to Understand From </p><p>Where We\'ve Come" </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) In response to various questions about issues of </p><p>concern in The Bahamas, such as overcrowding, lack of </p><p>investment and urban planning, Wilson kept coming back to the </p><p>same theme.  Essentially, he dismissed current problems by </p><p>saying that regardless of their gravity, The Bahamas, and </p><p>more specifically, black people in The Bahamas, have come a </p><p>very long way since majority rule.  He spoke proudly of the </p><p>way the Pindling administration broke first the political and </p><p>then the economic monopoly on power of the Bay Street Boys, </p><p>and declared his optimism about the future.  He dismissed </p><p>foreign investor concerns about the PLP\'s program of </p><p>"Bahamianization" saying you had to view it in the context of </p><p>Bahamian history, and that the PLP government welcomed </p><p>foreign investment, pointing to the recent signing of the </p><p>Atlantis expansion deal.  He wondered why it was a South </p><p>African who brought that kind of investment to The Bahamas, </p><p>rather than an American. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Wilson confidently predicted the PLP would win </p><p>election again in 2007, and dismissed the FNM as disorganized </p><p>and poorly led.  He also said that for the first time in </p><p>2002, the PLP was "competitive" in terms of campaign </p><p>financing.  According to Wilson, the PLP spent approximately </p><p>$7 million on the 2002 campaign (the FNM claims to have spent </p><p>about $4 million, but neither is required to provide any </p><p>accounting for campaign contributions or expenditures, so </p><p>both figures are suspect).  That would amount to close to $70 </p><p>per registered voter.  He dismissed questions about whether </p><p>or not this was an excessive amount for such a small country, </p><p>and did not elaborate on where all this money came from. </p><p> </p><p>Bishop Neil Ellis </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Bishop Ellis, the pastor of a large Baptist church </p><p>(6400 members) in a working class neighborhood of southern </p><p>Nassau, is one of The Bahamas\' most controversial figures. </p><p>He publicly endorsed Perry Christie during the 2002 campaign </p><p>and reportedly told his congregation from the pulpit during a </p><p>religious service that they must support Christie if they </p><p>wished to remain members of his church.  Ellis also held a </p><p>huge religious revival featuring a renowned U.S. evangelist </p><p>that was a magnet for criticism about the reported </p><p>"greediness" of its fundraising appeal.  (Establishment </p><p>religious figures now sometimes preface fund-raising remarks </p><p>by noting that the funds "will not be used to build a </p><p>vacation house in Bimini" to distinguish themselves from the </p><p>self-proclaimed bishop.  The press hounds him constantly </p><p>about his flamboyant personal lifestyle and open political </p><p>preferences.  Ellis was another protigi of Sir Lynden </p><p>Pindling, who identified him as a promising young man growing </p><p>up on the small island of Bimini and brought him to Nassau to </p><p>complete his education.  He is affiliated with the Full </p><p>Gospel Baptist Church headquartered in New Orleans, and is </p><p>its "bishop" for international churches, theoretically having </p><p>all Full Gospel Baptist churches in The Bahamas under his </p><p>leadership.  Prime Minister Christie has openly referred to </p><p>Ellis as his spiritual adviser, and many Bahamians assume </p><p>that his influence runs deep within the administration. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) POL/ECON section chief arrived at Ellis\' Mt. Tabor </p><p>Full Gospel Baptist Church, and was met by the first of </p><p>Ellis\' personal assistants, who passed me to the second, who </p><p>entertained him while Ellis finished a meeting with his seven </p><p>associate pastors.  Ellis then received Emboff in his nicely </p><p>appointed (bordering on lavish, but not quite passing over </p><p>into poor taste) office.  He was dressed in a loud magenta </p><p>clerical shirt with gold and diamond cufflinks, a thick gold </p><p>chain, several large gold rings and a gold Rolex watch. </p><p>Ellis is a thin, energetic man of middling height, in his </p><p>early forties.  He is married and has three adopted </p><p>daughters. </p><p> </p><p>Anointing of the King </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p> 9.  (C) Ellis described for POL/ECON section chief the </p><p>remarkable story of how he came to endorse Perry Christie in </p><p>the 2002 elections.  According to Ellis, he barely knew </p><p>Christie before the run up to the election in 2001.  At that </p><p>time, he says Christie began seeking an appointment with him, </p><p>saying he needed to speak with him for several hours.  Ellis </p><p>says that he kept putting Christie off, both because he </p><p>didn\'t have that time to spare and because he had a bad </p><p>initial impression of him.  Ellis said that this bad opinion </p><p>dated from the PLP leadership battle Christie won against </p><p>B.J. Nottage after the death of Lynden Pindling.  Nottage was </p><p>a friend and former congregation member of Ellis and harbored </p><p>a lot of ill will toward Christie because of his loss. </p><p>Christie was persistent in his pursuit of Ellis, whose church </p><p>membership has definite PLP leanings (Three PLP MPs, </p><p>including two Cabinet ministers, call it their home church), </p><p>however.  Finally, according to Ellis, he agreed to take </p><p>Christie along with him on an evangelical trip to the U.S., </p><p>promising that if Christie attended all he services he </p><p>preached at, Ellis would give him the time in between to </p><p>listen to his appeal.  Ellis said that, when given the </p><p>opportunity, Christie and Ellis spoke for 13 hours straight, </p><p>about both secular and spiritual matters and that Ellis </p><p>progressively became more convinced that Christie had been </p><p>"sent by God" to lead The Bahamas.  The meeting ended, </p><p>according to Ellis, in a scene reminiscent of the Biblical </p><p>story of Samuel\'s anointing of Saul, with Christie coming </p><p>around the table they were seated at, going to his knees and </p><p>requesting a blessing from Bishop Ellis.  At that time, Ellis </p><p>reported "the Spirit came upon him" and told him that he had </p><p>to endorse Christie. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Ellis, on the one hand, denied having or wanting any </p><p>political influence with Christie, but on the other hand went </p><p>to great lengths to explain how close their relationship is </p><p>and how often Christie calls on him for spiritual guidance. </p><p>For example, Ellis recounted that Christie had presented him </p><p>with the names of his Cabinet nominees before they were </p><p>announced and asked for him to pray over them and give his </p><p>opinion.  Ellis says that, although Christie has offered him </p><p>several government positions (most recently The Bahamas\' </p><p>Ambassador for Religious Tourism) and other rewards such as </p><p>free government land to build a new church, he has turned it </p><p>all down and wants nothing from Christie or the government </p><p>(or at least nothing they\'ve offered yet). </p><p> </p><p>It\'s All Just Jealousy </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) Ellis claims that, ever since Mt. Tabor started to </p><p>grow and he began to be seen as a successful pastor, he has </p><p>come under attack by others, including other pastors, who are </p><p>jealous of his success.  As a result, Ellis claims he has </p><p>been unfairly vilified in the press, particularly the </p><p>scandal-mongering tabloid The Punch.  Ellis says that during </p><p>one stretch The Punch printed negative articles about him in </p><p>95 consecutive editions, beginning with an unsubstantiated </p><p>rumor that he was carrying on a homosexual affair with a </p><p>member of his congregation.  In addition, Ellis has received </p><p>heavy criticism for the large salary he draws (reportedly a </p><p>tax-free $180,000 a year), and his penchant for luxurious </p><p>living.  Recently attention has focused on the impressive </p><p>house he is building for himself in one of Nassau\'s more </p><p>exclusive neighborhoods, reportedly costing $1 million. </p><p>Ellis claimed that the stories were exaggerated, but made no </p><p>excuses for his lifestyle, implying it was only fitting for </p><p>the pastor of such a large and thriving church. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) The one press story that he claimed hurt him the </p><p>most, however, was the one published by leading daily The </p><p>Tribune shortly before the election, claiming that Ellis had, </p><p>from the pulpit, instructed his congregation to vote for the </p><p>PLP, saying that if they didn\'t, they should "haul hip" out </p><p>of his church.  Ellis said he was most hurt by the fact the </p><p>Tribune did not contact him prior to publishing the story for </p><p>his version of events.  According to Ellis, a rival pastor, </p><p>Bishop Simeon Hall, a strong FNM supporter, was the source of </p><p>the story.  He sent a tape recording of some of Ellis\' </p><p>sermons to all of the papers.  Ellis admits that the tape -- </p><p>which he claims contains selectively edited portions of three </p><p>different sermons -- could easily lead you to believe he had </p><p>instructed his church how to vote, but he denies this. </p><p>According to Ellis, his comments were taken out of context, </p><p>and that while he did officially endorse Christie and the PLP </p><p>from the pulpit on several occasions (doing as he says the </p><p>Holy Spirit moved him to do), he never tried to tell others </p><p>how to vote or threatened anyone if they didn\'t vote for the </p><p>PLP.  He blames the whole issue on poor journalism and the </p><p>jealousy of other, less successful pastors.  Ellis claims the </p><p>Tribune is biased against him because he signed an exclusive </p><p>deal with the rival Nassau Guardian for all of the church \'s </p><p>considerable printing business, in exchange for a full-page </p><p>platform in the weekly religious section. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (C) As a consequence of his on-going bad press, Ellis </p><p>has vowed not to respond to any of the allegations against </p><p>him.  Doing so, he said, just legitimizes those allegations </p><p>and gives them more life.  Many in his congregation, he says, </p><p>have disagreed with this policy and urge him to publicly lash </p><p>out at his critics, which he admits is tempting, but he </p><p>continues to maintain his silence, preferring to let the </p><p>criticism pass. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>14.   (C) Wilson and Ellis, each in a different way, wield </p><p>considerable influence in the Christie government, despite </p><p>not being members of that government.  Wilson is one of the </p><p>financial mainstays of the party, and the PLP needs his money </p><p>to counteract the FNM\'s traditional fundraising advantage </p><p>with the traditional white business elite.  Ellis openly uses </p><p>his pulpit in one of Nassau\'s largest and fastest growing </p><p>churches to advance the PLP\'s political agenda, and by </p><p>allying himself so closely with Christie, has surpassed many </p><p>of his more established (and perhaps more respectable) </p><p>religious brethren in influence.  Both are outspokenly </p><p>passionate in their support for the party, having been </p><p>nurtured by Lynden Pindling from an early age, and both will </p><p>probably remain active and influential in PLP circles for </p><p>many years to come.  Both have substantial power, profound </p><p>influence, and no accountability. </p><p>BLANKENSHIP </p><p></p></div>
