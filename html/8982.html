<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004072 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, EB, NEA/NGA, EUR/SE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/25/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, MARR, MOPS, PTER, ASEC, TU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: KURDISH GROUPS\' UNILATERAL ACTIONS CONTINUE TO </p><p>OBSTRUCT FLOW OF ASSISTANCE AND TRADE TO IRAQ </p><p> </p><p>REF: A) ANKARA 3922 B) ANKARA 3794 C) ANKARA 3731 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary and action request:  Reftels report the KDP\'s </p><p>practice of charging taxes/fees for goods crossing the </p><p>Turkish-Iraqi border.  Reports from GOT officials, local </p><p>businessmen, and UN officials indicate that the KDP continues </p><p>to charge fees for certain goods and vehicles.  UN and MFA </p><p>officials also complain of long delays on the Iraqi side of </p><p>the border.  This situation is disrupting the flow of </p><p>assistance to Iraq and hampering our overall reconstruction </p><p>efforts.  Ref A recommends that the USG devise (with the KDP </p><p>if necessary) a more equitable, transparent system for </p><p>processing the movement of people and goods to/from Iraq. </p><p>Post looks forward to Department\'s guidance on this issue. </p><p>End summary and action request. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>KDP Still Charging Fees, Reports of Delays at Border </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Reports from GOT officials, local businessmen, and UN </p><p>officials indicate that the KDP continues to charge fees for </p><p>certain goods and vehicles crossing the Turkish-Iraqi border </p><p>(reftels).  U.N. World Food Program (WFP) Ankara </p><p>representative David Schaad told us June 25 that the KDP was </p><p>still charging the WFP $20/truck.  Schaad said he was also </p><p>concerned about the long wait at the border (which he claimed </p><p>was up to 25 km of trucks on either side of the border), </p><p>which he attributed mainly to bottlenecks on the Iraqi side. </p><p>Schaad noted, however, that the GOT was also slowing traffic </p><p>by meticulously checking incoming trucks to ensure they were </p><p>not smuggling cheap fuel into Turkey.  Schaad also complained </p><p>that the Iraqi side was giving priority to U.S. contractors\' </p><p>trucks, which further delayed WFP trucks.  Alp Ay of the </p><p>MFA\'s Multilateral Political Organizations office also told </p><p>us June 25 the border was congested primarily due to </p><p>technical and administrative bottlenecks on the Iraqi side. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) An official from USG military contractor Kellogg, </p><p>Brown, and Root (KBR) told us June 25 that the KDP had </p><p>stopped charging KBR trucks several weeks ago; however, he </p><p>said, he had heard that other vehicles entering Iraq from </p><p>Turkey were still routinely being charged taxes/fees.  (Note: </p><p> as reported ref C, local KDP rep Safeen Dizayee told us June </p><p>9 that the KDP would exempt U.S. military and UN shipments.) </p><p>The Vice President of Delta Petroleum, a private Turkish </p><p>company engaging in barter trade with SOMO (septel), told us </p><p>June 25 that the KDP had not charged the Delta trucks </p><p>entering Iraq with benzine and LPG.  However, the Delta </p><p>official said, he had just learned that Delta trucks </p><p>attempting to enter Turkey with Iraqi fuel oil were being </p><p>charged a USD 120 per truck "export tax" by the KDP.  Delta\'s </p><p>trucks were currently stuck at the border while the company </p><p>decided what to do about this tax. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Security Concerns Increasing for Truckers </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The WFP and KBR officials with whom we spoke </p><p>complained that the security situation in Iraq was </p><p>deteriorating, particularly near and to the south of Baghdad. </p><p> WFP\'s Schaad said that security concerns were deterring </p><p>Turkish truckers from driving WFP supplies south of Baghdad; </p><p>the KBR official said he was also having trouble getting </p><p>truckers to go near or to the south of Baghdad, adding that </p><p>his trucks were routinely returning from Iraq with bullet </p><p>holes, and one of his drivers had recently been shot (but </p><p>appeared to be recovering). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Action Request </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The KDP\'s continued practice of charging a range of </p><p>taxes/fees for goods crossing the Turkish-Iraqi border is </p><p>disrupting the flow of assistance to Iraq and hampering our </p><p>overall reconstruction efforts.  Post will continue to press </p><p>the GOT to reduce all unnecessary obstacles to the flow </p><p>across its border to facilitate fully the two-way trade.  On </p><p>the Iraqi side, we reiterate the recommendation in Ref A: </p><p>that the USG devise (with the KDP if necessary) a more </p><p>equitable, transparent system for processing the movement of </p><p>people and goods to/from Iraq.  Post looks forward to early </p><p>Department guidance on this issue. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
