<p>UNCLAS HARARE 001032 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>AF/PD FOR COX AND ROBERTSON, AF/S FOR KRAFT AND </p><p>SCHLACHTER, AF/RA FOR DIPALMA, INR/R/MR, NSC FOR </p><p>JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ZI, PREL, PHUM </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION DROC PEACE TALKS; HARARE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   Under headline "DRC dialogue, the Sun City </p><p>   Agreement holds," the independent weekly "The Zimbabwe </p><p>   Mirror" dedicated its April 26 editorial to urging DRC </p><p>   talks facilitator, Sir Ketumile Masire, to "persuade </p><p>   RCD-Goma (Rally for Congolese Democracy)" to accept </p><p>   the partial peace settlement reached at Sun City in </p><p>   South Africa, in order to promote peace in the </p><p>   Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>2.   ". . .The hope for lasting peace in the DRC was </p><p>   rekindled by the UN announcement on 24 April that </p><p>   the UN Security Council supports the partial </p><p>   agreement between the Kinshasa government of Joseph </p><p>   Kabila and one rebel group, the MLC (Congolese </p><p>   Liberation Movement) </p><p>   . . .The Kabila government has announced that they </p><p>   are happy with a partial deal that they say is </p><p>   better than no deal at all.  To all positive </p><p>   thinking people, the political cup of the DRC is </p><p>   now half full, and not half empty. . .  Another </p><p>   disturbing signal coming from Sun City is the </p><p>   unfortunate position taken by the talks\' </p><p>   facilitator, Sir Ketumile Masire.  Masire was </p><p>   reported to have decided to side with RCD-Goma in </p><p>   refusing to accept the partial deal. . .  It is </p><p>   baffling to see the mediator of a potentially </p><p>   explosive situation such as that of the DRC, siding </p><p>   with the groups that are calling for a return to </p><p>   war. . .  Any positive move, no matter how small, </p><p>   should be clutched and guarded jealously.  And, the </p><p>   deal between the Kabila government and the MLC is </p><p>   not a small deal at all. </p><p> </p><p>   "It seems as if by refusing to accept that deal, </p><p>   the facilitators had missed one of the highlights </p><p>   of the Congolese Internal Dialogue.  We therefore </p><p>   congratulate the UN for the timely statement </p><p>   released by the President of the Security Council. </p><p>   . .in support of the DRC partial agreement.  This </p><p>   is the first time that the UN has acted swiftly and </p><p>   timely since the DRC conflict started in 1998.  It </p><p>   could be another sign that Africa is back on the </p><p>   \'world\' agenda!  It is our hope that Sir Ketumile </p><p>   Masire would now persuade RCD-Goma to join the </p><p>   transitional government in order to promote peace </p><p>   not only in the DRC, but in the whole of Southern </p><p>   Africa." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
