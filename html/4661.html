<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002784 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PHUM, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZCTU LEADERS ARRESTED IN ADVANCE OF FIZZLED </p><p>NCA/MDC-SPONSORED STAYAWAY </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 02620 </p><p>     B. HARARE 02726 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING </p><p> </p><p>1.(SBU)  Summary.  Reports indicate that eleven senior </p><p>members of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) were </p><p>arrested by Zimbabwean police the day before a planned </p><p>mass-action stayaway which the ZCTU had not even endorsed. </p><p>Participation in the stayaway has been sporadic -- possibly </p><p>because the ZCTU failed to support the stayaway call, which </p><p>originated from the leadership of the National Constitutional </p><p>Assembly (NCA) and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). </p><p>Anecdotal reports indicate that while traffic on Harare </p><p>streets is only marginally lighter than normal, at most only </p><p>25-30% of workers have actually heeded the call to stay home </p><p>from work within the capital city, and 20% may have </p><p>participated nationwide -- figures that may well prove </p><p>optimistic.  The ultimate success or failure of eventual mass </p><p>action could depend upon the evolving situation of the ZCTU\'s </p><p>detained leadership, who ironically chose not to support the </p><p>abortive stayaway.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>ZCTU Leaders Pay the Political Price Despite Attempts to </p><p>Distance Themselves </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Wellington Chibebe, secretary general of the ZCTU </p><p>and a very recent IVP visitor to the US, along with ten other </p><p>high-level ZCTU leaders, was picked up by the police late in </p><p>the evening of December 9 at a labor seminar sponsored by the </p><p>AFL-CIO\'s Solidarity Center.  According to reports, the </p><p>eleven were removed from the seminar by police although there </p><p>is no indication that they were charged with any criminal </p><p>activity.  Attorneys are urgently attempting to locate the </p><p>eleven as well as obtain their release through the courts. </p><p>In typical GOZ fashion, the eleven detainees were not </p><p>immediately taken to a police station or charged, although </p><p>our contacts have heard unconfirmed reports that they are </p><p>currently being kept in two separate police stations in the </p><p>Mbare high-density area.  Solidarity Center contacts state </p><p>that attorneys have not been granted access to the detainees </p><p>and have received no report on their condition.  When (and </p><p>if) charges are actually brought, the eleven detainees are </p><p>likely to be charged with violating the repressive Public </p><p>Order and Security Act (POSA).  The ZCTU has been very wary </p><p>of endorsing a mass-action stayaway without clear support </p><p>from the rank-and-file membership, reftel b, and they have </p><p>neither advised their membership to participate nor to flout </p><p>the call for a stayaway.  Despite this public neutrality, the </p><p>GOZ has chosen the ZCTU as the most visible target of its </p><p>official displeasure at the call for mass action. </p><p> </p><p>NCA Estimates 20% Nationwide Participation </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU)  Dr. Lovemore Madhuku, chairperson of the NCA, </p><p>confirmed that he was aware of the ZCTU arrests, and stated </p><p>that he is currently in hiding due to reports that the GOZ is </p><p>also searching for the NCA\'s leaders.  Madhuku believes that </p><p>they have achieved 25-30% participation in the stayaway among </p><p>workers in the Harare area, although the response outside of </p><p>Harare is believed to be much lower.  Currently, the NCA\'s </p><p>reports indicate 10% participation in Bulawayo and 20% </p><p>participation in Mutare, Gweru and Masvingo.  Overall, </p><p>Madhuku estimates a 20% participation rate nationwide. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU)  Madhuku speculated on several causes which might </p><p>have had an impact on participation.  He stated that (as with </p><p>the failed ZCTU stayaway in March) a lack of clear </p><p>communication may have limited worker response.  Madhuku also </p><p>theorized that some employers may have refused to grant </p><p>absence without pay, which could have dampened the enthusiasm </p><p>of some workers in this harsh economic climate, especially as </p><p>the expensive outlays of the annual holiday season approach. </p><p>One strategy contemplated by the NCA was to have youths stand </p><p>at commuter omnibus stops to prevent workers from boarding </p><p>public transport.  However, due to reported police presence </p><p>at some bus stops this morning, that strategy apparently </p><p>failed.  There are unconfirmed reports of protests in some of </p><p>the high density areas, including reports that a commuter </p><p>omnibus was set on fire by youths in the Kuwadzana area. </p><p>(Comment:  Kuwadzana was the former seat of recently deceased </p><p>MDC parliamentarian Learnmore Jongwe.  This area, which will </p><p>be strongly contested by ZANU-PF in the upcoming by-election, </p><p>has been the recipient of massive political attention -- </p><p>including reports of food distributions solely benefitting </p><p>ZANU-PF cardholders -- in recent weeks.  End comment.) </p><p> </p><p>Companies Report Little Impact </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU)  Although many employers are reluctant to give much </p><p>information over the phone due to fears of GOZ retribution, </p><p>several firms with American ties report little impact from </p><p>the stayaway.  While most companies are open for business, </p><p>several have reported that some workers were late but ascribe </p><p>this to the ever-present transport difficulties. </p><p> </p><p>Street Traffic Lighter, Security Presence Heavier than Usual </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU)  The traffic on the streets -- both pedestrian and </p><p>vehicular -- is somewhat lighter than usual, although there </p><p>are several alternative explanations.  Zimbabwean schools are </p><p>not in session, which generally means less omnibus traffic. </p><p>In the downtown area, anecdotal reports indicate that in </p><p>areas where parking spaces were completely occupied by 0830 </p><p>yesterday morning, only about 2/3 were occupied at the same </p><p>time this morning.  While some observers attribute this to </p><p>the fuel shortage rather than participation in the stayaway, </p><p>others note that those who drive private vehicles -- managers </p><p>and professionals -- would be less likely to support a mass </p><p>action stayaway than the rank-and-file workers, who are more </p><p>likely to commute via commuter omnibus. </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU)  There is an increased military and police presence </p><p>on the streets, although even the MDC concedes that this is </p><p>"nothing too significant."  Laboff and visiting Deskoff, </p><p>returning from an offsite meeting, noticed a passing </p><p>transport truck loaded with police decked out in riot gear. </p><p>Despite the increased security presence, there have been no </p><p>reports of confrontations between security forces and </p><p>stayaway supporters in the business districts.  However, two </p><p>separate sources have reported confrontations with police in </p><p>Chitungwiza and Mabvuku, high-density areas surrounding </p><p>Harare, in which people stoned vehicles including public </p><p>transport buses. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU)  Consistent with previous expectations, see reftels </p><p>a and b, there was little hope of widespread participation in </p><p>this stayaway without massive buy-in from labor groups as </p><p>well as other members of civic society.  Although the NCA and </p><p>the MDC were hoping for support from the ZCTU, the labor </p><p>organization has never publicly endorsed the calls for mass </p><p>action optimistically scheduled for this week.  The ZCTU has </p><p>been very reluctant to call for participation in an action </p><p>which was not widely communicated and clearly destined to </p><p>succeed.  The GOZ\'s actions in pre-emptively arresting the </p><p>ZCTU\'s leadership, however, speak loudly to the nervousness </p><p>of ZANU-PF.  These arrests, ironically, may well spur the </p><p>ZCTU to a more aggressive response than they would otherwise </p><p>have chosen.  With eleven top ZCTU elected officials arrested </p><p>despite their failure to endorse a mass stayaway, the GOZ may </p><p>have forced the ZCTU into a corner from which calls for mass </p><p>action are the only legitimate response. </p><p>WHITEHEAD </p><p></p></div>
