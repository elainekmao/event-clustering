A) STATE 64055 </p><p>     B. B) 01 ABUJA 2856 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Overview: Nigeria is yet to generate any significant new </p><p>export activity under AGOA.  Main reasons for this lack of </p><p>progress appear to be Nigeria\'s unfavorable exchange rate and </p><p>investment climate.  Moreover, the Government of Nigeria and </p><p>USG have been unable to finalize the visa regime that would </p><p>allow exports under the textile and apparel provisions of </p><p>AGOA.  This is a joint Lagos/Abuja message.  End Overview. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.    Market Economy/Economic Reform/Elimination of Barriers </p><p>to U.S. Trade: The Government of Nigeria, under </p><p>democratically elected President Olusegun Obasanjo, has </p><p>repeatedly stated its commitment to the free market and </p><p>economic reform.  With assistance from donors and the </p><p>International Monetary Fund (IMF), the GON initiated a </p><p>program of deregulation and privatization. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  Notwithstanding the efforts toward privatization and </p><p>deregulation, the Government\'s overall economic policies have </p><p>often been inconsistent with the putative goals of reform and </p><p>opening its markets.  In late 2001, the formal program with </p><p>the IMF was terminated because Nigeria did not meet key </p><p>macro-economic targets established under that program.  In </p><p>early 2002, the Government suspended implementation of an </p><p>informal IMF program that sought more liberal exchange rate </p><p>policies and fiscal restraint.  The Nigerian Government </p><p>continues to support a fixed and arguably overvalued exchange </p><p>rate and high protective tariffs that restrict export </p><p>competition.  Policies that keep the Naira overvalued also </p><p>effectively subsidize imports, penalize non-oil exports, and </p><p>contribute to widespread currency arbitrage.  Deficit fiscal </p><p>spending forces the Central Bank of Nigeria to employ harsh </p><p>monetary policy in an effort to mop up excess liquidity. </p><p>This activity contributes to extremely high real interest </p><p>rates and the unavailability of affordable credit for long </p><p>term investment.  Nigeria\'s erratic tariff regime seeks to </p><p>protect domestic industry but discourages investment in </p><p>productive activity, depresses market competition, and leads </p><p>to the institutionalization of "tariff avoidance" behavior by </p><p>importers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.    The country\'s telecom sector experienced dramatic </p><p>development resulting from the introduction of GSM service. </p><p>Other aspects of Nigeria\'s infrastructure witnessed only </p><p>modest improvement in 2001.  Notwithstanding the recent </p><p>collapse of the effort to privatize NITEL, the Government </p><p>continues to move forward with privatization.   But Nigeria\'s </p><p>investment promotion efforts are unable to overcome valid </p><p>perceptions of corruption, security problems, fraud, and </p><p>bureaucratic red tape.  The development of capital markets, </p><p>including a vibrant stock exchange, and a renewed focus on </p><p>capitalizing and assisting small and medium-size enterprises, </p><p>may offer hope for catalyzing domestic investment.  Nigeria\'s </p><p>financial institutions, however, remain almost exclusively </p><p>focused on foreign exchange transactions.  The domestic banks </p><p>seem unable, at least in the short run, to provide sufficient </p><p>capital to rejuvenate the country\'s declining industrial and </p><p>agricultural sectors. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.    Nigeria is party to numerous conventions and agreements </p><p>regarding patent, trademark, and copyright protection; the </p><p>country\'s laws generally favor protection of intellectual </p><p>property owners and provides criminal penalties for violation </p><p>of their rights.  Regarding licensed information technology </p><p>such as software, limited progress is being made, primarily </p><p>through the efforts of the private sector.   However, </p><p>enforcement of existing IPR laws is weak because of limited </p><p>resources.   Piracy (counterfeiting of protected intellectual </p><p>rights) remains commonplace, and the courts do not have the </p><p>expertise to enforce the anti-piracy laws. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.    Nigeria does not discriminate against U.S. goods or </p><p>services and allows for the free movement of foreign exchange </p><p>into and out of the country. However, U.S. firms have </p><p>sometimes encountered difficulties obtaining government </p><p>procurement contracts or taking advantage of trade </p><p>opportunities.  Some U.S. bidders allege foreign competitors </p><p>are engaged in non-transparent lobbying practices that </p><p>undercut U.S. corporations, even when the U.S. firm enjoys a </p><p>financial or technical advantage.  U.S. firms also complain </p><p>of foreign competitors utilizing fraudulent import </p><p>documentation schemes to avoid payment of tariffs. </p><p>Sensitive to these allegations, the Nigerian Government has </p><p>issued concise procurement guidelines and has begun a due </p><p>diligence process for capital expenditures over 5 million </p><p>Naira (about USD 45,000) and 100 percent customs inspection </p><p>of goods entering the country. </p><p>7.  Rule of Law/Political Pluralism/Anti-Corruption: The May </p><p>1999 inauguration of a democratically-elected president ended </p><p>nearly sixteen consecutive years of military rule.  During </p><p>these years of military rule, the institutions of government </p><p>were mismanaged and allowed to atrophy.  Since the return of </p><p>democracy, these institutions have begun to rebound. </p><p>National and state assemblies are functioning.  There are </p><p>three recognized political parties and several others that </p><p>are seeking to register with the Electoral Commission. </p><p>Opposition politicians and the media openly criticize the </p><p>Government and are free to express differing points of view. </p><p>In 2003, democratization in Nigeria will pass another </p><p>milestone with the holding of national and state elections. </p><p>Free and fair elections will help consolidate democracy, </p><p>opening the door to more political and economic reform. </p><p>8.  Respect for the rule of law has improved since the 1999 </p><p>return of democratic government.  For example, the Supreme </p><p>Court recently made landmark decisions that affirm its role </p><p>as the final arbiter of the national constitution and help </p><p>define the contours of Nigerian federalism.  However, the </p><p>judicial system overall faces a lack of resources and </p><p>inadequate administration that delay resolution of cases. </p><p>There is a widespread perception that many lower level judges </p><p>and magistrates are susceptible to inducements.  This </p><p>perception affects investor confidence in the court system\'s </p><p>ability to safeguard intellectual and other property rights </p><p>and the courts\' ability to provide equal protection under the </p><p>law.  Efforts to reform the judiciary are underway, but </p><p>comprehensive reform will be a long process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.    Corruption is a problem not only in the courts, but </p><p>throughout government and society.  President Obasanjo has </p><p>publicly committed to fight corruption, calling this one of </p><p>his top priorities.  Pursuant to this commitment, the </p><p>Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences </p><p>Commission (ICPC) was founded to investigate official </p><p>corruption.  The ICPC receives some training assistance from </p><p>the U.S. Department of Justice.  Despite ICPC and other </p><p>initiatives to eliminate corruption in the federal </p><p>government\'s contracting processes, corruption remains a </p><p>persistent problem. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  Poverty Reduction: Poverty reduction is the stated </p><p>lodestar of the Government,s economic agenda, but progress </p><p>has been minimal.  While greater attention has been placed on </p><p>provision of basic services such as education and health, </p><p>there has been little effective reform in these areas. </p><p>Efforts in poverty reduction, including education and health </p><p>care, have lacked cohesion and direction with many programs </p><p>competing for limited international donor and GON resources. </p><p> Government is engaged with the World Bank and International </p><p>Monetary Fund, supported by USAID and other donors, to </p><p>develop a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.  The most </p><p>effective poverty reduction approach might be to focus on </p><p>per-capita economic growth, industrial capacity utilization, </p><p>gainful employment and support for a heretofore shrinking </p><p>Nigerian middle class.  For poverty reduction to take root, </p><p>government policies must be revised as the overall effect of </p><p>its macroeconomic and investment policies appear to retard </p><p>the economic growth and investment needed to spur poverty </p><p>reduction. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11. Labor/Child Labor/Human Rights: Nigeria has a small but </p><p>influential organized labor movement.  Except for members of </p><p>the armed forces and certain essential government security </p><p>personnel, Nigerian workers may join trade unions and strike. </p><p> The Government of Nigeria is engaged in addressing the </p><p>problems of child labor and is a participant in efforts to </p><p>eliminate trafficking in women and children.  Worker rights </p><p>and child labor laws are on the books but law enforcement is </p><p>weak.  Although its position on human rights is a vast </p><p>improvement over the former military regimes, the </p><p>Government\'s record on human rights is mixed.  While civil </p><p>liberties and political rights are well respected, security </p><p>forces have often employed excessive force to quell civil </p><p>unrest.  Extra-judicial killings have been committed by </p><p>security forces in their attempt to control outbreaks of </p><p>communal tensions which escalated during 2001.  Although they </p><p>do so less frequently than they did during military rule, </p><p>security officials still beat detainees, and arbitrarily </p><p>arrest and detain suspects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12. AGOA Trade and Investment: Interest in the tariff </p><p>benefits offered by AGOA remains high among Nigeria\'s </p><p>business community, but the GON and the Nigerian private </p><p>sector have been unable to develop an AGOA-related export </p><p>sector to date.  Nigerians are increasingly aware they are </p><p>unprepared to exploit AGOA.  To our knowledge, Nigeria has </p><p>been unable to generate any new AGOA-related </p><p>investment/exports.  Growth in foreign direct investment in </p><p>Nigeria\'s non-oil sector, while positive, is disappointing </p><p>and well below the GON\'s stated goals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.    AGOA Outreach/Technical Assistance: The U.S, Mission </p><p>in Nigeria is highly engaged in promoting AGOA throughout the </p><p>country. </p><p>-- In 2001, the Economic and Commercial Counselors </p><p>participated in AGOA workshops sponsored by the Nigerian </p><p>Economic Summit Group and the Nigerian Association of </p><p>Chambers of Commerce of Industry, Mining, and Agriculture. </p><p>-- The Public Diplomacy office is enlisting a speaker to </p><p>address processing exports and will send two AF/PD-sponsored </p><p>AGOA Interns to the U.S. for training. </p><p>-- The Foreign Commercial Service is working closely with the </p><p>Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce, the Nigerian Stock </p><p>Exchange, and other Nigerian entities to facilitate business </p><p>outreach and the development of strategic commercial </p><p>partnerships. </p><p>-- The U.S. Agency for International Development is promoting </p><p>agricultural exports, specifically working on gum Arabic, </p><p>sesame seeds, cashews, and other products.  In addition, all </p><p>USAID efforts to influence economic policy take into the </p><p>account the importance of AGOA and other export </p><p>opportunities.  Examples of  2001/2002 USAID reports and </p><p>studies that include AGOA are: </p><p>     "Comparative Evaluation of Draft Trade and Industrial </p><p>Policies". </p><p>     "Constraints to Investment and Exporting in Nigeria: </p><p>Towards An Agenda for Donor Intervention". </p><p>     "Implementing Nigeria\'s Export Promotion Policy". </p><p>     "Comments on Draft Trade Policy". </p><p>     "WTO Membership Obligations: Nigeria in Comparison to a </p><p>New Member". </p><p>     "Implementing Trade Policy in Nigeria: Findings and </p><p>Recommendations". </p><p>     "Nigerian Tariff Liberalization and Nigerian Exports: </p><p>Analysis and Comparative Performance". </p><p>     "Issues in Harmonizing the Structure of Protection in </p><p>ECOWAS: The Case of Nigeria". </p><p>     "Proposed National Framework: Trade and Commercial </p><p>Policy". </p><p>     "Cassava Export Potential". </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>14.    Led by the Ministry of Commerce, Nigeria has </p><p>established an inter-agency AGOA committee that has received </p><p>USAID assistance.  USAID is also working to strengthen </p><p>individual textile firms that could benefit from AGOA when </p><p>the textile visa system is operative.  Both the Ministry and </p><p>the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission have AGOA </p><p>offices.  Legislation to allow a needed increase in the </p><p>penalty for transshipment is caught in the political </p><p>stalemate that has affected almost all legislation in the </p><p>National Assembly, and the GON has been responsive to </p><p>numerous suggestions from the USTR on its AGOA-related </p><p>regulations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>15.    Host Country Trade Capacity Building Needs: Due to the </p><p>country\'s constrained infrastructure capacity, particularly </p><p>an erratic power supply, Nigerian businessmen claim they face </p><p>a cost disadvantage of at least 25 percent compared with </p><p>foreign competition.  In some less serviced parts of Nigeria, </p><p>they assert this figure climbs to 50 percent.  Although </p><p>infrastructure difficulties are real, a more important </p><p>obstacle is probably macro-economic mismanagement that has </p><p>led to high inflation and a non-competitive exchange rate. </p><p>With the loss of cash crop production during the last 30 </p><p>years, the agriculture sector currently is unable  to exploit </p><p>AGOA on large scale.  A few products such as ginger, gum </p><p>Arabic, and frozen prawns have possibilities for establishing </p><p>niche markets in the U.S. under AGOA, and USAID is working </p><p>with potential exporters.  Nigeria\'s reputation for </p><p>corruption, criminal activity, and financial fraud serves as </p><p>a disincentive for many potential U.S. importers and keeps </p><p>them from engaging local entrepreneurs directly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>16. Misguided macro-economic policies and a deficient </p><p>infrastructure prevent Nigeria from taking advantage of AGOA. </p><p> Government completion of agreements on textile and apparel </p><p>provisions will allow these items to benefit from AGOA </p><p>tariff-free treatment, but without improved macroeconomic </p><p>conditions Nigeria may not be competitive with its African </p><p>neighbors who started much earlier.  Another question is </p><p>whether Nigeria can jumpstart its Free Trade Zones where red </p><p>tape and other negatives are minimized.  These, too, however, </p><p>are subject to infrastructure deficiencies and exchange rate </p><p>difficulties and so far have not met expectations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
