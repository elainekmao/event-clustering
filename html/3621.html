Summary: Sri Lanka plans extensive reforms in the </p><p>telecommunications sector with the aim of developing a </p><p>technology-neutral, open and convergent telecommunications </p><p>market.  One of the most significant developments will be </p><p>the opening of international voice services.  Other planned </p><p>reforms include liberalization of all market segments, and </p><p>deregulation of tariffs and controls on cross ownership of </p><p>services.  A National Communications Policy (NCP) containing </p><p>these reforms is to be adopted by the Government soon. </p><p>These reforms will change the telecommunications landscape </p><p>of the country and help implement an ambitious ICT sector </p><p>strategy.  The reforms, if completed, will also enable Sri </p><p>Lanka to meet its WTO commitments.  End Summary </p><p> </p><p>2.  The ending of a 5-year monopoly in August 2002 in </p><p>international voice services enjoyed by Sri Lanka Telecom </p><p>(SLT) has presented an opportunity for extensive reforms in </p><p>the telecommunications sector.  Sri Lanka will adopt a new </p><p>National Communications Policy (NCP) that seeks to promote </p><p>the establishment of a technology-neutral, open and </p><p>convergent telecommunications market structure with minimal </p><p>restrictions and regulations.  The policy, the development </p><p>of which was sponsored through a World Bank consultancy, was </p><p>drafted with extensive industry and public input.  It covers </p><p>fixed and mobile telephone services, data and internet </p><p>services, satellite phone services, cable TV and </p><p>broadcasting services, and tries to meet requirements of </p><p>technological developments in these markets.  The GSL also </p><p>plans to introduce a new Convergence Act covering ICT, </p><p>broadcast, media and telecommunications by December 2002. </p><p>This act will replace the various laws and regulations </p><p>governing these services. </p><p> </p><p>Opening of international voice services </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>3.  One of the most important reforms is the proposed </p><p>opening of international voice telephone services.  The move </p><p>will allow fixed voice, mobile and data operators to operate </p><p>international voice services, and enable Sri Lanka to meet </p><p>its WTO obligations to liberalize international voice </p><p>telecommunications (due on December 31, 1999).  The new </p><p>policy will lift current entry barriers to technologies such </p><p>as Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) and also remove </p><p>approvals now needed for satellite connections.  In </p><p>addition, it promises a review of the current de facto </p><p>monopoly of SLT on underground international cables with a </p><p>view to ending the monopoly. </p><p> </p><p>4. While the GSL plans to fully open the international </p><p>sector with no predetermined limits on licenses, existing </p><p>private fixed line telecom operators who have invested </p><p>heavily on network expansion have warned against a "big </p><p>bang" opening of the market.  Instead, they have urged the </p><p>government to adopt an incremental approach for the </p><p>international gateway liberalization by limiting the number </p><p>of players to two initially.  The Government is unlikely to </p><p>accede to this request.  A top government telecom official </p><p>recently signaled that it would not establish a duopoly, </p><p>saying that such an arrangement would lead to illegal bypass </p><p>by other operators. </p><p> </p><p>5.  Prior to opening the sector, the GSL is hoping to </p><p>establish a strong interconnection environment and has </p><p>invited consultants to advise on three areas - comparative </p><p>models in international telecom services markets, </p><p>interconnection agreements, and licensing agreements for new </p><p>players entering the international voice market.  The </p><p>interconnection agreements will also seek to establish a </p><p>calling party pay (CPP) system for mobile users, which will </p><p>significantly boost mobile services. </p><p> </p><p>Opening of other markets </p><p>------------------------ </p><p>6.  In addition to the liberalization of the international </p><p>gateway, the NCP will allow access by new entrants to fixed </p><p>wire line and mobile services, and permit cross ownership of </p><p>multiple networks and services.  At present, mobile </p><p>operators cannot operate fixed lines and fixed line </p><p>operators cannot operate mobile services.  For an initial </p><p>period of 12 months, the ownership of multiple services will </p><p>be allowed only in demarcated low-density areas.  Despite </p><p>the market opening, complete liberalization of wireless </p><p>services will be delayed until 2005 due to an exclusivity </p><p>clause in the licenses of the current operators. </p><p> </p><p>Regulation: Communications Regulatory Commission </p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- </p><p>7.  Under the new policy, the Telecommunications Regulatory </p><p>Commission (TRC) will be named Communications Regulatory </p><p>Commission (CRC) and will play the role of an independent </p><p>regulator to create an open and fair environment in line </p><p>with requirements of WTO\'s telecommunications services </p><p>agreement.  CRC\'s regulatory authority is expected to ensure </p><p>competition in all markets. </p><p> </p><p>8. One of the most significant regulatory changes will be </p><p>the deregulation of tariffs.  Under the policy, CRC will </p><p>regulate tariffs only in cases of services provided by </p><p>dominant or monopoly operators, where market forces are </p><p>insufficient to constrain service pricing.  The policy </p><p>contains safeguards to ensure fair competition in the use of </p><p>infrastructure including restrictions on operators that have </p><p>significant market power or control bottleneck facilities. </p><p>Also in the cards is a review of spectrum management with a </p><p>view to introducing a transparent spectrum allocation and </p><p>pricing system.  CRC will also be responsible for ensuring </p><p>access to space management through Intelsat or other </p><p>satellite systems. </p><p> </p><p>Business opportunities </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>9.  The opening of the telecommunications sector, which is </p><p>the fastest growing sector in the economy with a growth rate </p><p>of over 25 percent in 2001, will present significant trade </p><p>and investment opportunities.  Sri Lanka imports various </p><p>telecommunications equipment from abroad, including the US, </p><p>to support network expansion.  The services to be opened for </p><p>investment include domestic and international telephone </p><p>services, leased circuits and dedicated telecommunications </p><p>networks and services. </p><p> </p><p>10. According to the new policy, CRC may entertain </p><p>applications without regard to the nature of technology, </p><p>including fixed wire line or Internet Protocol.  Additional </p><p>licenses will also be issued for mobile and paging services, </p><p>depending upon the availability of radio frequencies. </p><p>Investors are likely to enjoy low license fees designed to </p><p>promote market entry.  CRC will also evaluate the </p><p>feasibility of introducing next generation communication </p><p>services.  Another area to be liberalized is public access </p><p>services on a resale basis such as public pay phones and </p><p>tele-centers.  The government will also encourage cable TV </p><p>and other multimedia broadband services. </p><p> </p><p>Expansion of rural services </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>11.  The National Universal Access Policy (NUA) contained in </p><p>the NCP seeks to promote the expansion of information and </p><p>communication technology in rural areas not serviced by </p><p>suppliers on a commercial basis.  The services include </p><p>conventional telephone, Internet and email facilities and </p><p>establishment of community tele-centers.  All </p><p>telecommunications operators and service providers will be </p><p>obliged to contribute to the achievement of "national </p><p>universal access" (NUA) objectives as a condition of their </p><p>license. </p><p> </p><p>e-Lanka Vision </p><p>-------------- </p><p>12.  The GSL is planning in the next few weeks to launch a </p><p>comprehensive ICT road map that details an e-lanka vision </p><p>for Sri Lanka.  Sri Lanka has sought the assistance of </p><p>various partners such as USAID, the World Bank and the </p><p>Government of India for the development of the ICT road map. </p><p>Sri Lanka intends to use ICT as a lever for overall social </p><p>and economic development in the country.  The new NCP is </p><p>expected to lay the foundation for the implementation of the </p><p>ICT roadmap by unshackling the sector and opening it for </p><p>private investment and competition. </p><p>Amselem </p><p></p></div>
