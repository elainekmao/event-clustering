<p>UNCLAS HARARE 002316 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AF/PD, AF/S, AF/RA </p><p>NSC FOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KPAO, KMDR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON THE U.S., UN AND IRAQ; </p><p>HARARE </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Under headline "U.S. drums of war silenced - for </p><p>      now" the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" </p><p>      dedicated its October 21 editorial to applauding the </p><p>      recent United Nations resolution regarding arms </p><p>      inspection in Iraq. Excerpts: </p><p> </p><p>  2.   ". . .While we applaud the new UN resolution that </p><p>      does not call for the automatic use of force against </p><p>      Iraq if it does not meet the terms of the deal, we </p><p>      are, however, concerned that the U.S. is threatening </p><p>      to flout the UN resolution, thus seriously undermining </p><p>      the world body and bringing into question its </p><p>      relevance in world affairs. . .  This shows that the </p><p>      U.S. does not feel bound by UN resolutions, and we do </p><p>      not think the world body would be in a position to </p><p>      censure the </p><p>      U.S. in the event of unsanctioned military </p><p>      strikes. . .  We believe the step taken by the </p><p>      UN to force the U.S. into backtracking on the </p><p>      threatened use of force against Baghdad is in </p><p>      the right direction since it sends a clear </p><p>      message to countries in the habit of meddling in </p><p>      others\' affairs that the world will not tolerate </p><p>      that. . ." </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
