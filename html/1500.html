REASONS: 1.5 </p><p>(B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>REF:  HARARE 507 </p><p> </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF ZIMBABWE\'S SUPREME COURT, </p><p>ANTHONY GUBBAY, TOLD CHARGE ON JANUARY 26 THAT ZANU-PF </p><p>WANTS TO FIND A WAY TO FORCE HIM AND HIS FOUR COLLEAGUES </p><p>OFF THE COURT.  IN A MEETING SEVERAL DAYS EARLIER, VICE </p><p>PRESIDENT MUZENDA REPORTEDLY ACCUSED GUBBAY, WHO IS WHITE, </p><p>OF BEING A RACIST BECAUSE HE HAS RULED AGAINST THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT IN KEY CASES.  THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO DISMISSED </p><p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE\'S REQUEST FOR PROTECTION AGAINST </p><p>INCREASING HARASSMENT BY SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS.  GUBBAY </p><p>WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE PRACTICAL AND MORAL SUPPORT HE HAS </p><p>RECEIVED FROM THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY, BUT EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN THAT ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT MIGHT BE </p><p>COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.  THE DEPARTMENT MAY WISH TO CONSIDER </p><p>APPROPRIATE WAYS IN WHICH WE MIGHT SIGNAL INTERNATIONAL </p><p>CONFIDENCE IN THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, FOR NOW </p><p>THE LAST CHECK ON PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S EXERCISE OF </p><p>UNTRAMMELED POWER.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) CHARGE, ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF, CALLED ON ZIMBABWEAN </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE ANTHONY GUBBAY ON JANUARY 26.  CHARGE </p><p>EXPRESSED U.S. CONCERN ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH\'S </p><p>INCREASING CRITICISM OF THE JUDICIARY, AND INTIMIDATION AND </p><p>HARASSMENT OF ITS JUSTICES BY SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS, AND </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00538  01 OF 03  261215Z </p><p>ASKED HOW GUBBAY WAS HOLDING UP.  GUBBAY SAID THE SUPREME </p><p>COURT HAS ALWAYS RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FROM THE </p><p>UNITED STATES AND ITS EMBASSY IN HARARE, AND HE WAS </p><p>GRATEFUL.   HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS INCREASINGLY </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR THE COURT\'S JUSTICES TO DO THEIR WORK UNDER </p><p>CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. </p><p> </p><p>MEETING WITH VICE PRESIDENT MUZENDA </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  GUBBAY SAID HE HAD BEEN TERRIBLY UPSET AFTER HIS </p><p>MEETING ON JANUARY 22 WITH VICE PRESIDENT MUZENDA.  (NOTE: </p><p>GUBBAY HAD SOUGHT THE MEETING TO REQUEST PROTECTION AGAINST </p><p>INCREASING INTIMIDATION BY WAR VETERANS.  IN NOVEMBER, A </p><p>GROUP OF ANGRY VETERANS INVADED THE SUPREME COURT TO </p><p>PROTEST THE COURT\'S RULING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAST </p><p>TRACK RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  IN DECEMBER, WAR VETERANS </p><p>ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WOULD BE </p><p>ATTACKED IN THEIR HOMES IF THEY DID NOT RESIGN WITHIN TWO </p><p>WEEKS.  END NOTE.)  MUZENDA REPORTEDLY REFUSED TO TAKE </p><p>STEPS TO IMPROVE THE SECURITY OF THE COURT AND ITS </p><p>JUSTICES, SAYING IT WAS THE WAR VETERANS WHO FELT </p><p>THREATENED BY THE COURT.  GUBBAY WAS SURPRISED AT MUZENDA\'S </p><p>DEEP ANTAGONISM AGAINST HIM.  THE VICE-PRESIDENT ACCUSED </p><p>GUBBAY, WHO IS WHITE, OF BEING RACIST, BLAMED HIM FOR ALL </p><p>THE SIGNIFICANT CASES THE GOVERNMENT HAS LOST, AND SAID </p><p>GUBBAY\'S RETIREMENT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION BY THE CABINET. </p><p> </p><p>DETERMINED TO REMAIN FIRM </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00538  01 OF 03  261215Z </p><p>4.  (C)  GUBBAY SAID HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES ON THE COUNTRY\'S </p><p>HIGHEST BENCH WORK WELL TOGETHER.  NONE OF THEM RENDER </p><p>JUDGMENTS BASED ON POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS, HE INSISTED, </p><p>BUT RULE AS THEY THINK IS FAIR AND JUST.  HE IS CONVINCED </p><p>THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WANTS HIM AND THE COURT\'S FOUR </p><p>OTHER JUSTICES OUT, AND THAT MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND </p><p>PUBLICITY JONATHAN MOYO AND JUSTICE MINISTER PATRICK </p><p>CHINAMASA ARE LEADING THE CHARGE.  (NOTE:  CHINAMASA </p><p>RECENTLY TOLD JOURNALISTS THE JUSTICES SHOULD BE REPLACED </p><p>BECAUSE THEY WERE COLONIALIST HOLDOVERS FROM THE IAN SMITH </p><p>REGIME.  END NOTE.)  GUBBAY AND HIS FELLOW, JUSTICES, </p><p>HOWEVER, ARE "DETERMINED TO REMAIN FIRM AND BATTLE ON." </p><p>GUBBAY NOTED THAT HE REACHES HIS MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE </p><p>OF 70 IN APRIL 2002.  HE MIGHT TAKE FOUR MONTHS OF </p><p>ACCUMULATED LEAVE PRIOR TO THAT DATE, HOWEVER, MEANING A DE </p><p>FACTO DEPARTURE FROM THE COURT AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. </p><p>GUBBAY NOTED, WITHOUT ELABORATING, THAT TWO OTHER JUSTICES </p><p>MIGHT ALSO CHOOSE TO STEP DOWN BY THE END OF 2001. </p><p> </p><p>REMOVING A JUDGE NOT EASY </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) GUBBAY EXPLAINED THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO </p><p>REMOVE A JUDGE PRIOR TO THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE OF 70. </p><p>HE CITED THE ABSENCE OF A JUDICIAL CODE OF CONDUCT AS THE </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0480 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00538  02 OF 03  261215Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------BBF1A1  261215Z /38 </p><p>O 261212Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8105 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000538 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 01/26/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZIMBABWEAN SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE HOLDS FIRM </p><p>IN FACE OF INTIMIDATION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00538  02 OF 03  261215Z </p><p>PRINCIPAL GUARANTEE OF THE JUDGES\' TENURE.  IN FACT, IN </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S HISTORY, ONLY ONE MEMBER OF THE BENCH HAS BEEN </p><p>EXPELLED FOR MISCONDUCT.  IF ANY JUDGE BELOW THE CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE IS ACCUSED OF MALFEASANCE, THE PRESIDENT CANNOT </p><p>TAKE ANY ACTION UNLESS THE CHIEF JUSTICE REQUESTS THAT HE </p><p>APPOINT A SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE TRIBUNAL.  IF THE CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE HIMSELF IS ACCUSED OF MISCONDUCT, THE PRESIDENT CAN </p><p>TAKE THE INITIATIVE IN APPOINTING THE TRIBUNAL, WHICH </p><p>NORMALLY COMPRISES A SENIOR JUDGE FROM A NEIGHBORING </p><p>COUNTRY AND TWO JURISTS RECOMMENDED BY THE NATIONAL LAW </p><p>SOCIETY OF ZIMBABWE.  BOTH THE TRIBUNAL AND THE JUDICIAL </p><p>SERVICES COMMISSION, ON WHICH GUBBAY SITS, MUST RECOMMEND A </p><p>JUDGE\'S REMOVAL IN ORDER FOR THE PRESIDENT TO TAKE SUCH A </p><p>STEP. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) GIVEN THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS AVENUE, GUBBAY </p><p>SURMISED THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE MIGHT TRY TO FORCE THROUGH </p><p>PARLIAMENT A RECENTLY-INTRODUCED BILL CALLING FOR THE CHIEF </p><p>JUSTICE\'S IMPEACHMENT, BUT HE WAS DISMISSIVE OF SUCH AN </p><p>EFFORT, STATING THAT THE LEGISLATIVE BODY HAS NO </p><p>JURISDICTION OVER THE SUPREME COURT.  GUBBAY SAID HE WAS </p><p>PROUD OF HIS RECORD AS CHIEF JUSTICE, AND THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO MANUFACTURE EVIDENCE IF IT </p><p>INTENDED TO TRY TO ACCUSE HIM OF MISCONDUCT. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY HIS MAIN CONCERN </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) GUBBAY SAID HIS MAIN WORRY FOR NOW IS PROTECTING </p><p>THE SECURITY OF THE COURT AND ITS JUSTICES.  ASKED WHETHER </p><p>THE GOZ PROVIDES A BODYGUARD FOR HIM, HE SAID NO, AND HE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00538  02 OF 03  261215Z </p><p>WAS NOT INTERESTED IN ONE, AS SUCH PROTECTION CERTAINLY </p><p>WOULD BE PROVIDED BY AN AGENT OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZATION (CIO).  INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS ARE POSTED </p><p>AT EACH OF THE JUSTICES\' HOUSES, BUT THEY ARE YOUNG AND </p><p>WOULD BE UNABLE TO PREVENT AN INVASION BY GROUPS SEEKING TO </p><p>DO HARM.   GUBBAY NOTED THAT THE SEVERAL DEMONSTRATIONS </p><p>HELD BY SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS IN FRONT OF THE COURT WERE </p><p>EXTREMELY WELL-ORGANIZED, CONSISTED OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER </p><p>OF ILLITERATE WOMEN BUSED IN FROM THE HIGH-DENSITY SUBURBS, </p><p>WITH LITTLE IDEA WHY THEY WERE THERE, HOLDING UP </p><p>PROFESSIONALLY-PRINTED PLACARDS. </p><p> </p><p>WHY NOT JUST IGNORE JUDICIAL RULINGS </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) CHARGE ASKED WHY THE GOVERNMENT FELT IT NECESSARY </p><p>TO GO BEYOND MERELY IGNORING THE SUPREME COURT\'S RULINGS -- </p><p>ON THE FAST TRACK RESETTLEMENT EXERCISE, FOR EXAMPLE -- TO </p><p>QUESTIONING THE MOTIVES OF ITS JUSTICES AND SUBJECTING THEM </p><p>TO AN APPARENTLY ORCHESTRATED CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATION. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT, GUBBAY REPLIED, WOULD MUCH PREFER TO HAVE </p><p>THE JUDICIARY ENDORSE THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAST TRACK PROGRAM </p><p>AS CONSISTENT WITH ZIMBABWEAN LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION, </p><p>WHICH IT IS NOT.  JUDICIAL RULINGS THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S </p><p>ACTIONS ARE UNLAWFUL OR UNCONSTITUTIONAL GIVES IT A </p><p>TERRIBLE IMAGE IN THE EYES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. </p><p>NO SENSIBLE PERSON OPPOSES LAND REFORM, GUBBAY INSISTED, </p><p>BUT WHO, HE ASKED, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DELAY?  THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS HAD 20 YEARS TO IMPLEMENT A FAIR PROCESS, </p><p>BUT HAS FAILED TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00538  02 OF 03  261215Z </p><p>ZANU-PF WILL REFUSE TO GO EVEN IF IT LOSES IN 2002 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) GUBBAY CONFIRMED THAT THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL </p><p>ELECTION MUST BE HELD BETWEEN JANUARY 1 AND MARCH 31, 2002. </p><p>ASKED WHETHER THE PRESIDENT COULD RESIGN AND LEGALLY CALL A </p><p>SNAP ELECTION LATER THIS YEAR, THE CHIEF JUSTICE WAS </p><p>UNSURE, WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STUDY, WHETHER THE CONSTITUTION </p><p>WOULD PERMIT SUCH A MOVE.   GUBBAY (STRICTLY PROTECT) </p><p>OFFERED HIS PERSONAL VIEW THAT, EVEN IF ZANU-PF LOSES THE </p><p>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE PARTY WILL NOT AGREE TO HAND </p><p>OVER POWER. </p><p> </p><p>U.S. ASSISTANCE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) CHARGE PRAISED GUBBAY\'S COURAGE DURING THESE </p><p>TRYING TIMES, AND ASKED HOW THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE OF </p><p>ASSISTANCE.  GUBBAY WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE OFFER, BUT ASKED </p><p>THAT THE U.S. NOT ISSUE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT, </p><p>AS THIS WOULD ONLY OPEN US UP TO CRITICISM THAT WE WERE </p><p>TAKING SIDES.   HE EXPRESSED GENUINE APPRECIATION FOR THE </p><p>OUTSTANDING SUPPORT THE JUDICIARY HAS RECEIVED FROM THE </p><p>DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY HERE, AND NOTED THAT HE HAS RECEIVED </p><p>LETTERS OF ENCOURAGEMENT FROM AROUND THE WORLD. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0481 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00538  03 OF 03  261215Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00  INL-00 </p><p>      DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00 </p><p>      FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    DCP-01   NSAE-00  OIC-02   OMB-01 </p><p>      OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00     SP-00 </p><p>      IRM-00   SSO-00   STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  PMB-00   DSCC-00 </p><p>      PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00   SWCI-00    /010W </p><p>                  ------------------BBF1AD  261215Z /38 </p><p>O 261212Z JAN 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 8106 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC IMMEDIATE </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000538 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR </p><p>LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR WILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL. 01/26/11 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, PINS, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  ZIMBABWEAN SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE HOLDS FIRM </p><p>IN FACE OF INTIMIDATION </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00538  03 OF 03  261215Z </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11. (C) GUBBAY WAS APPOINTED CHIEF JUSTICE BY PRESIDENT </p><p>MUGABE IN 1990.  HE IS A THOUGHTFUL, WELL-RESPECTED JURIST, </p><p>WHO, AS ONE OBSERVER RECENTLY COMMENTED, DOES NOT HAVE A </p><p>POLITICAL BONE IN HIS BODY.  THE GOVERNMENT\'S ORCHESTRATED </p><p>EFFORTS TO INTIMIDATE AND SMEAR GUBBAY AND OTHER JUSTICES </p><p>CLEARLY TROUBLE HIM, BUT WE ARE IMPRESSED BY HIS </p><p>DETERMINATION NOT TO GIVE IN TO SUCH HARASSMENT.  VICE- </p><p>PRESIDENT MUZENDA\'S RIDICULOUS COMMENT THAT WAR VETERANS </p><p>FEEL THREATENED BY THE COURT\'S RULINGS AND HIS REFUSAL TO </p><p>AUTHORIZE INCREASED SECURITY FOR GUBBAY AND HIS COLLEAGUES </p><p>SUGGEST THAT WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE CONTINUING ATTACKS ON THE </p><p>JUDICIARY.  GIVEN THE DIFFICULTY OF REMOVING SITTING </p><p>JUDGES, MUGABE\'S GOAL APPEARS TO BE TO TRY TO HOUND GUBBAY </p><p>AND OTHER INDEPENDENT-MINDED JUDGES INTO RESIGNING SO THAT </p><p>HE CAN REPLACE THEM WITH THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO DO HIS </p><p>BIDDING. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) THE DEPARTMENT MAY WISH TO CONSIDER CONVEYING </p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE IN THE SUPREME COURT\'S </p><p>INDEPENDENCE, IN A WAY THAT BOTH BOLSTERS THE BESIEGED </p><p>JUSTICES AND SENDS A MESSAGE TO ZANU-PF THAT ITS ATTACKS ON </p><p>THE JUDICIARY HAVE NOT GONE UNNOTICED.   GIVEN GUBBAY\'S </p><p>CONCERN THAT A PUBLIC STATEMENT ALONG THESE LINES MIGHT BE </p><p>COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, PERHAPS A LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM U.S. </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST TO GUBBAY MIGHT BE AN EFFECTIVE </p><p>APPROACH. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00538  03 OF 03  261215Z </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
