<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 002315 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS AND LEICHTER </p><p>NSC FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/08/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: ECONOMIC MINISTERS BATTLE FOR INFLUENCE AS ERDOGAN </p><p>APPOINTS LOYALISTS TO SENIOR POSITIONS IN BUREAUCRACY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5(b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  Infighting among economic ministers is </p><p>hindering the Government\'s efforts to coordinate policy </p><p>around an economic "super-minister."  Deputy PM Sener, who </p><p>was supposed to lead the economic team, appears to be losing </p><p>influence to Finance Minister Unakitan, while State Minister </p><p>Babacan\'s clout remains limited.  Meanwhile, PM Erdogan is </p><p>replacing a number of key technocrats with people loyal to </p><p>him, in many cases from Istanbul municipality and/ or Islamic </p><p>financial institutions.  The lack of a clear policy </p><p>coordination mechanism, combined with the latest personnel </p><p>reshufflings, is adding to investor concerns about this </p><p>government\'s willingness and ability to implement its </p><p>economic program effectively.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The AK Party took the reins of government late last </p><p>year intending to coordinate economic policy through an </p><p>economic "super minister" who would oversee Treasury, </p><p>Finance, and other key agencies.  Initial power struggles </p><p>resulted in half a loaf:  Abdullatif Sener was named Deputy </p><p>Prime Minister responsible for overall economic coordination, </p><p>with direct responsibility for the Privatization </p><p>Administration, Banking Regulatory and Supervision Agency </p><p>(BRSA), and State Planning Organization, but without direct </p><p>control over the Treasury or Finance Ministry. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) The months since then have witnessed constant </p><p>infighting among the ministers that has hindered policy </p><p>coordination and coherence.  According to senior Treasury </p><p>officials, Sener has been battling, unsuccessfully, to assert </p><p>greater control over economic policy.  He refused for two </p><p>months to sign a cabinet circular naming State Minister for </p><p>the Treasury Ali Babacan to chair the interagency committee </p><p>on improving the foreign investment environment.  He finally </p><p>was instructed to sign the circular, but the delay meant that </p><p>the committee did not even meet until February.  Sener </p><p>continues to wage the battle for management of foreign </p><p>investment policy through the State Planning Organization, </p><p>which is trying to wrest control of the issue from Treasury. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Other senior officials have told us that both Babacan </p><p>and Finance Minister Kemal Unakitan have largely ignored </p><p>Sener, reporting directly to the Prime Minister.  In recent </p><p>weeks, according to government officials and some Istanbul </p><p>analysts, Unakitan appears to have gained greater influence </p><p>at Sener\'s expense, as evidenced by the government\'s recent </p><p>decision to shift control of the Privatization Administration </p><p>from Sener to the Finance Ministry; Sener also lost his role </p><p>as government spokesman.  There have been unsubstantiated </p><p>press reports that Sener is frustrated and may be considering </p><p>resigning.  Analysts speculate that Unakitan\'s rise is due to </p><p>(a) his closer personal relationship to PM Erdogan (since </p><p>they worked together in Istanbul), and (b) his talent as a </p><p>pragmatic problem solver.  The consensus is that Babacan\'s </p><p>clout remains limited. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Erdogan\'s assumption of the Prime Ministry also has </p><p>led to the long-expected replacement of a number of senior </p><p>economic bureaucrats.  In the past two weeks, the government </p><p>has replaced the entire board of the two state banks, along </p><p>with two senior Privatization Administration officials. It </p><p>has also fired the head of the State Gas Pipeline Company </p><p>(BOTAS) and the State Electricity Trading Company TETTAS, </p><p>both of whom had reputations for competence.  This week, </p><p>markets are awash with rumors that Treasury U/S Faik Oztrak </p><p>will be replaced in the very near future, perhaps by Istanbul </p><p>Deputy Secretary General for Finance Mesut Pektas.  (Note: </p><p>Oztrak told us late April 8 that he had told Minister Babacan </p><p>that he could not continue as a "lame duck"; the government </p><p>needed either to replace him or back him fully.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) European diplomats argued to us April 7 that Erdogan </p><p>appears to be appointing new people to these key bureaucratic </p><p>positions based more on their loyalty to him than on their </p><p>competence or credibility with the markets.  For example, the </p><p>new Chairman of the State Bank Board, replacing respected </p><p>banker Safa Ocak, is Zeki Sayin, who managed the Istanbul </p><p>municipality-owned supermarket and then served on the board </p><p>of Islamic bank Family Finans.  Can Caglar, the new general </p><p>manager of state-owned Zirat bank, also was an executive at </p><p>Family Finans.  Istanbul investment bankers and analysts with </p><p>whom we met on April 3 were harshly critical of these </p><p>appointments, saying the new board members lacked experience </p><p>and credibility.  They and others in the financial markets </p><p>with whom we have spoken say they know little about Mesut </p><p>Pektas, Faik Oztrak\'s rumored replacement, who worked for the </p><p>Islamic finance house Al-Baraka Turk (as did Kemal Unakitan) </p><p>before working with Erdogan in the Istanbul municipality. </p><p>Faruk Demir, a leading national security analyst and </p><p>Executive Director of the Advanced Strategy Center, argues </p><p>that Pektas has a reputation for probity, credibility with </p><p>the capital markets, and is one of the few men close to </p><p>Erdogan who can give him the unvarnished truth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Comment:  To regain market confidence, this </p><p>government needs not only to implement its economic reform </p><p>program, but to avoid mistakes and unhelpful signals. </p><p>Unfortunately, the lack of policy coordination and discipline </p><p>within the government means populists such as Energy Minister </p><p>Hilmi Guler and Industry Minister Ali Coskun can continue to </p><p>make unhelpful public statements that rattle the markets.  It </p><p>also means that the business community -- as well as the IFIs </p><p>and foreign diplomats -- does not know where to turn for </p><p>support of sound economic policy.  (Note:  When we made this </p><p>complaint to Faik Oztrak April 8, he said "now you know my </p><p>problem.")  The government\'s replacement of competent </p><p>technocrats with people who are either unknown or do not </p><p>inspire confidence compounds the problem. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
