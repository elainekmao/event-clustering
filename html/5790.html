US sources are saying that </p><p>"Turkey better come up with a decision on whether to allow </p><p>US troops, or we will implement a Plan B."  Mass appeal </p><p>Hurriyet\'s Washington reporter also quotes a "high level and </p><p>very important US official" as saying that Turkey will have </p><p>to pay the consequences if it fails to permit US troops, and </p><p>that the US will never forget Turkey\'s decision.  Turkish </p><p>officials are reportedly "waiting for the right time" to </p><p>make their case to the parliament.  Most papers conclude </p><p>that Turkey has forwarded more demands to the US in order to </p><p>satisfy Turkish public opinion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hurriyet" outlined an agreement which is "close to being </p><p>concluded" between the US and Turkey regarding possible </p><p>military cooperation.  Turkey will keep 15,000 soldiers in </p><p>the oil-rich areas of Iraq in order to establish a buffer </p><p>zone.  Another 25-35,000 Turkish troops will be joining US </p><p>troops for joint action elsewhere in northern Iraq.  There </p><p>will be a co-command authority, with one Turkish and one US </p><p>general, Hurriyet reports. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, all papers and TV channels cover the ongoing </p><p>discussions between the US and Turkey on political, military </p><p>and economic issues.  "Zaman" reports that after parliament </p><p>speaker Bulent Arinc announced that the decision regarding </p><p>US troop deployments in Turkey would not be discussed in </p><p>parliament today, concerns have been raised about US-Turkish </p><p>ties.  Most weekend papers evaluated FM Yakis and State </p><p>Minister Babacan\'s sudden trip to the US as a "fruitless </p><p>visit."  Both ministers stated on their return that no </p><p>agreement had been reached on the economic package, even </p><p>after a  meeting with President Bush.  "Yeni Safak" reports </p><p>that Turkey had asked the US for written guarantees on </p><p>political, economic and military issues.  The US\' </p><p>unwillingness to make any commitments about Turkish losses </p><p>caused deep concern on the Turkish side. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cyprus: All papers cover the election results in Cyprus. </p><p>"Vatan" says that the Turkish Cypriots are upset about the </p><p>election victory of Tasos Papadopulos, a former EOKA </p><p>activist.  "Milliyet" reports that the victory of </p><p>Papadopulos had caused worries about the future of the </p><p>Cyprus talks.  "NTV" quoted TRNC president Denktas as saying </p><p>that "the solution to the Cyprus issue can hardly can be </p><p>worked out with Papadopulos, who already declares himself </p><p>president of the whole island." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iraq </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"US: Better make up your mind immediately" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand noted in mass appeal Posta (2/18): "After </p><p>spending some time in Washington, it seems to me that the </p><p>Bush administration is very determined to go ahead with the </p><p>Iraq operation with or without another UN resolution.  It </p><p>does not matter how strongly the Europeans oppose the U.S., </p><p>and it does not matter whether Turkey is involved or not. </p><p>The Iraq operation will be carried out and Saddam will be </p><p>toppled. . Given the circumstances, the nature of the </p><p>Turkish parliament\'s decision becomes historically important </p><p>regarding Turkish-American relations.  The US </p><p>administration, feeling stabbed in the back by France and </p><p>Germany, is now keeping a keen eye on Turkey.  Americans are </p><p>clearly warning that `time is almost up,\' and that Turkey </p><p>should come up with a decision. The Americans view it this </p><p>way: `We did our best to meet Turkey\'s expectations, and </p><p>that\'s it.\'  It seems that Ankara will have to produce a </p><p>parliamentary decision in the end whether it likes it or </p><p>not." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The American megalomania" </p><p>Ahmet Tasgetiren argued in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak </p><p>(2/18): "Turkey is facing a US threat based on messages </p><p>coming from Washington: `Unless the Turkish parliament </p><p>approves US military movements from Turkey to Iraq, a Plan B </p><p>will be implemented.\'  If this message is about `paying the </p><p>consequences,\' it is not only Turkey but also the US that </p><p>will pay a price.  The US is currently facing a world-wide </p><p>`common sense\' opposition, and Washington has been aiming to </p><p>tarnish Turkish common sense and pride." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Puzzle-ridden bargain between the US and Turkey" </p><p>Sedat Ergin reviewed the latest developments in the US- </p><p>Turkey negotiations under the following categories: </p><p>A) Political document </p><p>Turkey and the US are now debating a critical text related </p><p>to the future of Iraq. </p><p>Turkish and US officials continue to make adjustments in the </p><p>draft. The document will contain a series of principles </p><p>regarding the structure of a post-war Iraq.  The document </p><p>will regulate critical issues like the political and </p><p>constitutional structure of Iraq, the status of the </p><p>Turkomen, control of oil-rich areas, and the transfer of oil </p><p>to international markets. It is not yet clear whether the </p><p>document will come into effect through an exchange of </p><p>letters between the US President and the Turkish Prime </p><p>Minister, or will be prepared as a memorandum of </p><p>understanding. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B) Economic agreement </p><p>This document will include pledges for the compensation of </p><p>possible Turkish losses in the war by the US administration. </p><p>There are serious differences between the parties on this </p><p>issue. The US has increased the amount of proposed grants </p><p>for Turkey from $4 billion to $6 billion. Half of this </p><p>amount will be used to erase Turkey\'s military debt. In a </p><p>meeting with Turkish ministers last week, President Bush </p><p>stressed that the possible grant figure cannot go beyond the </p><p>current US proposal.  In addition, Washington is considering </p><p>a proposal to give Turkey credits instead of grants. The US </p><p>has offered to give Turkey up to $15 billion in credits. </p><p>However, Turkey is cool to this formula because it would </p><p>place an additional burden on the shoulders of Turkish </p><p>taxpayers.  Ankara is pushing for an increase in the grant </p><p>figure.  The US says that the Turkish estimate of $80 </p><p>billion in losses for a five-year period after the war is </p><p>not realistic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C) Agreement about the deployment of troops </p><p>This agreement is related to the stationing of US troops in </p><p>Turkey, their transition to northern Iraq and cooperation </p><p>between Turkish and US troops in northern Iraq. The number </p><p>of US troops to come to Turkey and the command of US and </p><p>Turkish troops in northern Iraq is under discussion within </p><p>this framework. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D) Other protocols </p><p>In addition to the main agreements, there is also bargaining </p><p>about some other protocols as well as certain secret </p><p>documents to be signed by the two parties.  All the </p><p>agreements are linked to each other. Progress in one of the </p><p>issues might positively impact the others.  If Turkey is not </p><p>satisfied on the political issues, it might decline to meet </p><p>US demands for military cooperation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E) Parliamentary permission </p><p>The most important move to influence the outcome of the </p><p>complicated bargaining is the pending parliamentary </p><p>permission for the deployment of US troops in Turkey.  The </p><p>permission will come to parliament\'s agenda if a </p><p>breakthrough is achieved in the bargaining process. At the </p><p>same time, the parliamentary permission for the deployment </p><p>of US troops will help progress on the other issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F) US vessels waiting off Turkish territorial waters </p><p>US vessels waiting off Turkish waters are an element of </p><p>pressure in the bargaining. </p><p>Washington says that the vessels will be sent to the </p><p>southern front unless the Turkish parliament issues the </p><p>necessary permission for the deployment of US troops today. </p><p>Ankara assumes that the US cannot afford to abandon its </p><p>plans for fighting on a northern front, and that the US is </p><p>bluffing in its threat to send the vessels to the Persian </p><p>Gulf.  Turkey is using parliamentary permission for the </p><p>deployment of US troops to exert pressure on the US. . </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In sum, the point where the parties stand right now </p><p>indicates a deadlock." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
