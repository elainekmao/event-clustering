<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 RANGOON 000235 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EB </p><p>COMMERCE FOR ITA JEAN KELLY </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA JEFF NEIL </p><p>USPACOM FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/23/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EFIN, PREL, ECON, BM, Economy </p><p>SUBJECT: BURMA\'S BANKS: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. RANGOON 225 </p><p> </p><p>     B. RANGOON 214 </p><p>     C. RANGOON 213 </p><p>     D. RANGOON 30 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The GOB has finally made a public statement </p><p>(on February 21) and committed to a strategy that will </p><p>hopefully spark a turnaround and begin to reshape the private </p><p>banking sector.  As the crisis enters its second week, we can </p><p>only await the effect of the GOB\'s strategy on depositors, </p><p>industry, and wage earners.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>S-1: Go About Your Business </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Secretary One (S-1), General Khin Nyunt, made the </p><p>first public GOB statement on the banking crisis on Friday </p><p>the 21st.  To ensure its readers would not skip over the </p><p>important message, which was buried toward the end of a </p><p>ponderous speech on the economy, the SPDC mouthpiece "The New </p><p>Light of Myanmar" printed in bold type (in both the English </p><p>and Burmese language editions) S-1\'s brief statement on the </p><p>banks. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The comment, surprisingly measured, called on people </p><p>to "do their work as usual without any worry concerning the </p><p>banks."  The causes for the current crisis were not </p><p>"destructionist elements," but negative "rumors" about the </p><p>safety of the banks.  S-1 assured listeners that money is </p><p>safer in the banks than outside, and that "banks guarantee </p><p>the safety of the savings."  While not going so far as to </p><p>extend a GOB guarantee of people\'s savings, S-1 did say that </p><p>"the government is rendering assistance for the convenience </p><p>of the people." </p><p> </p><p>Assistance Being Rendered </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In fact, the GOB did start off the week with some </p><p>efforts to get the crisis under control.  Bankers and other </p><p>businessmen corroborated a rumor we\'d been hearing that the </p><p>Central Bank had extended lines of credit worth 25 billion </p><p>kyat (about $25 million) to the three largest private banks </p><p>-- AWB, Yoma, and KBZ -- and between 10 billion and 20 </p><p>billion kyat total to three other private banks -- MOB, MUB, </p><p>and Mayflower.  As mentioned in Ref A, this money is being </p><p>offered only to banks that can provide collateral (real </p><p>assets) both on their books and in their possession.  At the </p><p>end of business on February 24, limits on withdrawals were </p><p>still in place and most private banks still were offering </p><p>only 100,000 kyat (about $100) per week to depositors. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) We\'ve also heard that the quasi-governmental </p><p>association overseeing Burma\'s industrial zones has </p><p>instructed garment factory owners to discuss with their </p><p>bankers the lifting, if need be, of withdrawal ceilings to </p><p>allow for factories to meet payroll requirements on February </p><p>28.  The details and background of this order are unclear, </p><p>but the businessmen posited that the regime had ordered </p><p>private banks to support factory payroll operations as part </p><p>of the deal for additional loans from the Central Bank. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Trading companies and other firms needing to meet </p><p>payroll have not received similar instructions.  However, one </p><p>large trader with whom we spoke said that he expected banks </p><p>to offer some sort of preferential system of withdrawals for </p><p>corporate customers as payday draws near. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The GOB appears to be stumbling toward a reasonable, </p><p>market-based solution to the current banking crisis.  It </p><p>hasn\'t provided an across-the-board guarantee of deposits, </p><p>and has required the banks to cough up real collateral in </p><p>return for the additional liquidity they require.  The </p><p>collateral will help ensure banks retire their borrowings </p><p>from the Central Bank as soon as they can, while the lack of </p><p>a deposit guarantee will leave the onus on depositors, if and </p><p>when they do get access to their accounts, to choose the best </p><p>bank for any return deposits they make.  Some banks -- </p><p>basically the worst of them -- will go under, but that\'s the </p><p>price of bad operations.  Only if all banks threaten to sink </p><p>will the GOB have to do more. End comment. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
