<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 02676 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356:  DECL:  OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PREL, KPAL, PREF, JO </p><p>SUBJECT:  JORDAN\'S REFUGEE CAMPS:  ARAFAT SHINES AGAIN </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C - ENTIRE TEXT) </p><p>- </p><p>2.  UNRWA\'S JORDAN FIELD DIRECTOR HALLQVIST SAID HE </p><p>AND THE CAMP DIRECTORS HAVE DETECTED A STRIKING </p><p>TRANSFORMATION IN ATTITUDES TOWARD ARAFAT AND </p><p>THE PLO AMONG PALESTINIAN REFUGEES IN THE WEEKS </p><p>FOLLOWING KING HUSSEIN\'S FEBRUARY 19 ADDRESS. </p><p>IN THE LATTER HALF OF 1985, THE PLO\'S IMAGE IN </p><p>THE CAMPS SANK TO A LOW EBB WITH RESIDENTS COMPLAINING </p><p>ABOUT PLO INTERNECINE RIVALRY AND CORRUPTION, </p><p>ARAFAT\'S WEAK LEADERSHIP AND DOUBLETALK, AND, </p><p>PARTICULARLY, THE DRYING UP OF PLO MONEY (FOR </p><p>SCHOLOARSHIPS, WIDOWS\' PENSIONS, PERSONAL LOANS, </p><p>ETC.).  THE DEPRESSED FORTUNES OF THE PLO WERE </p><p>VISIBLE IN MANY WAYS:  FATAH ACTIVISTS AMONG THE </p><p>REFUGEES KEPT A LOW PROFILE, TWO UNRWA UNIONS </p><p>OUSTED THEIR PRO-FATAH CHAIRMEN, AND THE NUMBER </p><p>OF DELEGATIONS TO PLO OFFICES DROPPED TO A TRICKLE. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, KING HUSSEIN GAINED RESPECT FOR </p><p>HIS PEACE EFFORTS.  REGARD FOR HASHEMITE RULE </p><p>VIVIDLY MANIFESTED ITSELF IN NOVEMBER 1985 WHEN </p><p>CROWN PRINCE HASSAN PAID AN UNANNOUNCED OFFICIAL </p><p>VISIT TO THE AMMAN NEW CAMP (POLITICALLY THE MOST </p><p>ACTIVE REFUGEE CAMP) THE DAY ARAFAT ARRIVED IN </p><p>AMMAN.  HASSAN QUICKLY ATTRACTED A LARGE AND </p><p>FRIENDLY CROWD (ALBEIT WITH THE HELP OF THE EVER </p><p>PRESENT SECURITY FORCES).  CAMP NOTABLES AT THE </p><p>TIME PLEDGED SUPPORT FOR THE HASHEMITES, POINTEDLY </p><p>IGNORING MENTION OF THE PLO, AND RESIDENTS SPOKE </p><p>WARMLY ABOUT THE VISIT FOR WEEKS AFTERWARD. </p><p>- </p><p>3.  THIS MOOD HAS CHANGED MARKEDLY.  CAMP RESIDENTS </p><p>INITIALLY WERE INDIFFERENT TO THE KING\'S SUSPENSION </p><p>OF RELATIONS WITH THE PLO.  THE ANTI-PALESTINIAN </p><p>OUTBURST OF MANY EAST BANKERS HOWEVER AFFECTED </p><p>THE EMOTIONS OF CAMP REFUGEES AS WELL AS OTHER </p><p>PALESTINIANS.  REFUGEES ALSO RESENTED THEIR </p><p>ENFORCED APPEARANCES AT THE PALACE TO DEMONSTRATE </p><p>"SUPPORT" FOR THE KING.  SOME CAMP NOTABLES SAID </p><p>SECURITY OFFICERS CAME TO THEIR HOMES DEMANDING </p><p>THEIR ATTENDANCE EVEN BEFORE THE KING\'S SPEECH </p><p>WAS BROADCAST.  FURTHERMORE, CAMP RESIDENTS HAVE </p><p>NOT MISSED HUSSEIN\'S LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THE </p><p>ARAB WORLD FOLLOWING HIS SPEECH AND HAVE ALSO </p><p>NOTED AN APPARENT LACK OF RESULTS IN THE KING\'S </p><p>EFFORTS WITH SYRIA:  ASSAD HAS YET TO VISIT AMMAN. </p><p>A SENSE HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS </p><p>THAT HUSSEIN HAS LOST ARAB BACKING, THAT HE HAS </p><p>WRONGED ARAFAT, AND THAT HE HAS TRIED TO EXPLOIT </p><p>THE PALESTINIANS. </p><p>- </p><p>4.  HALLQVIST VISITED DOZENS OF NOTABLES AT EACH </p><p>OF THE CAMPS DURING THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS.  ALMOST </p><p>ALL EXPRESSED ADMIRATION AND SUPPORT FOR ARAFAT, </p><p>SOMETHING ONE DID NOT HEAR A MONTH AGO.  "ARAFAT </p><p>IS OUR LEADER," MOST SAID SIMPLY.  HALLQVIST ASKED </p><p>A NOTABLE IN IRBID WHAT HOPE FOR PEACE HE COULD </p><p>EXPECT FROM ARAFAT.  "THERE IS NO HOPE FOR PEACE </p><p>IN THIS GENERATION, BUT ARAFAT IS RIGHTLY EXPRESSING </p><p>OUR JUST CAUSE," HE WAS TOLD. </p><p>- </p><p>5.  COMMENT:  THE SHIFT IN ATTITUDES IN THE </p><p>PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS MIRRORS, TO A GREAT </p><p>EXTENT, THE SHIFT IN THE PALESTINIAN </p><p>COMMUNITY AT LARGE.  IN SUM, HUSSEIN\'S </p><p>IMPLICIT CHALLENGE TO PALESTINIAN NATIONALISM </p><p>CAUSED THE PALESTINIANS IN THE CAMPS TO CIRCLE </p><p>THE WAGONS AROUND ARAFAT, DESPITE THEIR EARLIER </p><p>IRRITATION WITH SOME ASPECTS OF THE PLO\'S </p><p>PERFORMANCE. </p><p> </p><p>BOEKER </p><p></p></div>
