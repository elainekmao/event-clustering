<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 009071 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/20/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, ECON, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: SEZER VETO CALLS SIIRT ELECTIONS INTO QUESTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by acting Politcal Counselor Nicholas S. Kass. </p><p>Reason: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) President Sezer\'s Dec. 19 veto of a constitutional </p><p>amendment package, which is designed to reinstate AK Leader </p><p>Erdogan\'s political rights and clear the way for his entry </p><p>into government (septel), calls into question the date for </p><p>the "new" elections in Siirt Province and Erdogan\'s immediate </p><p>political future. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Pursuant to a petition by AK, the Nov. 3 national </p><p>election results in Siirt had been invalidated Dec. 9 by the </p><p>Supreme Election Board (YSK), due to local electioneering </p><p>shenaningans.  AK had seen Siirt as an opportunity to elect </p><p>Erdogan to the Parliament, from where he could formally </p><p>assume the duties of Prime Minister. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Now, however, whether Erdogan would stand for </p><p>elections in Siirt is an open question, made more complex by </p><p>both the veto and the evolving political situation on the </p><p>ground there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Given the uncertainty surrounding the constitutional </p><p>amendment package, the YSK never officially announced an </p><p>election date and calendar, though the virtual effect of its </p><p>Dec. 9 decision to invalidate the Siirt results was to </p><p>establish a Feb. 9 date. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The constitutional package includes a provision that would </p><p>have pushed the Siirt poll back to March 9.  By late </p><p>February, Erdogan\'s 3-year ban from "active" politics will </p><p>have run its course, allowing him to appeal for reinstatement </p><p>of his legal rights: enacting the package would improve </p><p>Erdogan\'s prospects for success. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- If a referendum on the vetoed package is called by Sezer, </p><p>its timing could be critical.  The Siirt option could be </p><p>denied to Erdogan if the elections are held Feb. 9, without </p><p>the adoption of constitutional changes and while Erdogan\'s </p><p>ban still holds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- According to press, some polls are showing Siirt voters </p><p>are miffed that AK had the provincial election results </p><p>annulled.  Moreover, several sources tell us CHP is trying to </p><p>cut a deal with the pro-Kurdish DEHAP (Democratic People\'s </p><p>Party), which is far and away the most popular party in the </p><p>province. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) AK is currently scouring the legal system for other </p><p>ways to get Erdogan into the legislature.  According to </p><p>press, one possibility involves amending and expanding the </p><p>amnesty provisions in the Turkish Press Law.  AK submitted a </p><p>draft to the TGNA President\'s Office Dec. 19, concerning the </p><p>law on "postponement of court cases and punishments related </p><p>to crimes committed through press and publications" (AKA Law </p><p>No. 4454). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- AK\'s draft proposes that those who have been convicted, </p><p>and who have served their sentences, for crimes under Turkish </p><p>Penal Code Art. 312 should be treated as if they never </p><p>committed the crime in question -- provided that they do not </p><p>commit the same crime again before the amendment is formally </p><p>enacted.  Erdogan was convicted and stripped of his political </p><p>rights under art. 312 (inciting religious/ethnic hatred) in </p><p>1999.  Current law could be read to make him ineligible to </p><p>run for office even after his ban ends. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- One Parliamentary expert expressed to us his doubts that </p><p>such a proposal would be workable absent constitutional </p><p>amendments.  Given Sezer\'s veto of the constitutional package </p><p>on grounds that it was geared toward one person -- Erdogan -- </p><p>we expect the President would oppose such a plan. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
