<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000278 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR SA/INS AND DS/OP/NEA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:    N/A </p><p>TAGS: NP, PTER, PGOV, CASC, ASEC, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS KILL 16 POLICE; CALL FOR NATIONWIDE </p><p>STRIKE </p><p> </p><p>REF(S):  (A)  KATHMANDU 0184; (B) 01 KATHMANDU 2388 </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Maoist insurgents continued their attacks </p><p>against police with a deadly assault on a police post in </p><p>Kavre District the morning of February 5.  On February 4 </p><p>Maoists also attacked an airport and guest house in the </p><p>popular tourist area of Lukla, Solukhumbu District, </p><p>causing property damage but no injuries.  To celebrate </p><p>the seventh anniversary of the insurgency February 13, </p><p>the Maoist leadership has called for a series of local </p><p>strikes (bandhs) across the country, culminating in a </p><p>nationwide bandh February 22-23.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p>ANNIVERSARY PREPARATIONS </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  Maoist violence--especially against the police- </p><p>-is increasing as the February 13 date marking the </p><p>seventh anniversary of the Maoist insurgency approaches. </p><p>The Maoists\' number-two leader, Dr. Baburam Bhattarai </p><p>(who has appended a new title--Coordinator of the United </p><p>Revolutionary People\'s Council--to his official </p><p>communications) has called for a series of local strikes </p><p>(bandhs) across the country from Feb. 7-21, culminating </p><p>in a nationwide bandh Feb. 22-23 in honor of the </p><p>anniversary. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------- </p><p>POLICE TARGETED AGAIN </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Although attacks against civilians in remote </p><p>areas continue, the Maoists appear once again to be </p><p>targeting police.  In addition to the eight policemen </p><p>killed in two separate attacks Jan. 23 and 28 (Ref A), </p><p>two more policemen were killed in a targeted landmine </p><p>explosion on a major highway near Pokhara January 31. </p><p>In the single most lethal attack against security forces </p><p>since the imposition of the state of emergency November </p><p>26, in the early morning hours of February 5 insurgents </p><p>attacked a police post along the highway in Bhankunde, </p><p>Kavre District, approximately 50 km south of Kathmandu. </p><p>After killing 16 policemen and injuring 4, the Maoists </p><p>carted away 39 rifles, 4 shotguns, and 10 pistols.  The </p><p>attack apparently lasted several hours (from 1:00 a.m. </p><p>to 5:00 a.m., according to one report); there were no </p><p>reports of Maoist casualties.  Despite the ferocity of </p><p>the assault and its proximity to Kathmandu, the local </p><p>press--both vernacular and English--carried no stories </p><p>of the attack. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The police post is located directly in front </p><p>of a project camp for Nepali laborers and staff building </p><p>a new highway funded by the Japanese government. </p><p>According to a Japanese embassy official, the Maoists </p><p>made no attempt to enter the project site or to take any </p><p>equipment from the site.  (Note:  Japanese project staff </p><p>live in Dhulikhel and were not present at the time of </p><p>the attack.  End note.)  The Japanese Embassy views the </p><p>incident as an attack against the police, rather than </p><p>the project, and intends to continue work on the road. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------- </p><p>GROUNDED IN LUKLA </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.   (U) Maoists also set off a small pressure cooker </p><p>bomb at the airport in Lukla, Solukhumbu District, at </p><p>about 11:00 p.m. February 4, blasting out several </p><p>windows and slightly damaging a tower.  A similar bomb </p><p>exploded at a guest house in the town. No injuries were </p><p>reported as a result of either blast.  The timing of the </p><p>attacks appears to have been designed to avoid </p><p>casualties. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  According to the Flight Operations Director </p><p>at Lukla Airport, airport staff had been receiving </p><p>threats for several days leading up to the attack and </p><p>had closed down the airport Feb. 2, pending the arrival </p><p>of Royal Nepal Army (RNA) troops to protect the </p><p>facility.  Airport staff confirmed helicopter-borne RNA </p><p>troops arrived the afternoon of Feb. 5--after the attack- </p><p>-and said flights out of Lukla will most likely resume </p><p>Feb. 6.  (Note:  With an airport as the entry point for </p><p>most tourists to the Mount Everest Base Camp, Lukla is a </p><p>popular tourist destination, although it sees little </p><p>tourist traffic at this time of year.  End note.)  The </p><p>Consular section has received no requests for assistance </p><p>from Amcits, although we understand that at least one </p><p>American may be in Lukla. </p><p> </p><p>--------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>--------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU)  The Maoists are stepping up their violent </p><p>activities just as Parliament is preparing to consider </p><p>an extension of the emergency.  The nationwide bandh the </p><p>Maoists had called for December 7 fizzled (Ref B); </p><p>whether the Feb. 22-23 bandh will be a similar non-event </p><p>remains to be seen.  With or without a strike, however, </p><p>the Maoists are increasing their pressure on the </p><p>government in the run-up to the anniversary of the </p><p>movement.  The police have long borne the brunt of the </p><p>Maoists\' campaign against the government.  During the </p><p>first ten months of 2001 the Maoists killed twice as </p><p>many police as in the previous year, while the number of </p><p>Maoists killed by police fell by almost 50 percent from </p><p>2000 levels.  Maoist violence against security forces </p><p>declined sharply after the imposition of the emergency </p><p>and deployment of the RNA November 26.   The recent </p><p>uptick in violence against police--and the resumption of </p><p>the time-tested tactic of overrunning police posts and </p><p>making off with the arsenal--suggests that the Maoists </p><p>may have rethought the wisdom of taking on the RNA.  To </p><p>celebrate their anniversary, the insurgents seem to be </p><p>once again focusing their efforts on their habitual, </p><p>tried-and-true targets--the police--with disturbing </p><p>success so far.  The Embassy will continue to monitor </p><p>the situation as more information--including whether </p><p>flights from Lukla resume Feb. 6 as planned--becomes </p><p>available. </p><p> </p><p>Malinowski </p><p></p></div>
