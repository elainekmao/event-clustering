<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008873 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CENTCOM AND EUCOM: PLEASE PASS TO POLADS AND J-5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/09/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: DECISION-MAKING IN TURKEY: AK\'S INTRODUCTION TO </p><p>THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 8252 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 8586 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by CDA a.i. Robert Deutsch.  Reasons: 1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: As disparate and well-placed sources had </p><p>predicted, Islam-influenced AK Party government received a </p><p>lecture on the dangers posed by "reactionary" Islam at the </p><p>Nov. 29 meeting of the National Security Council (NSC), the </p><p>first since AK assumed power. (On Dec. 9, AK P.M. Gul was </p><p>treated to another briefing on the "reactionary threat" and </p><p>other issues during a courtesy call on Gen. Ozkok, the TGS </p><p>Chief.)  This lecture illustrates a facet of Turkish </p><p>decision-making between elected governments and powerful </p><p>elements of the State which has a direct bearing on how </p><p>Turkey will respond on Cyprus, Iraq, reform and other issues </p><p>of central interest to the U.S.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) According to reports we have heard, at the Nov. 29 </p><p>meeting the military, seconded by President Sezer, made clear </p><p>to AK its view that the discussion whether to lift the ban </p><p>against Turkish civil servants\' wearing the headscarf is a </p><p>non starter.  "The discussion is over," Sezer reportedly told </p><p>P.M. Gul.  Before the meeting, Chief of the General Staff </p><p>Gen. Hilmi Ozkok and the other TGS commanders limited to an </p><p>abrupt three (3) minutes their "courtesy" call on new Speaker </p><p>of Parliament Arinc, who had generated controversy when he </p><p>had his headscarf-clad wife join him to see off Sezer on a </p><p>trip abroad late last month.  Official photos showed a </p><p>somewhat stiff, seated Arinc flanked on either side by Ozkok </p><p>and others.  The visit stood in marked contrast to an earlier </p><p>20 minute call on Gul, whom the military and other elements </p><p>of the Establishment see as relatively more pragmatic and </p><p>sensible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) The NSC, which according to the constitution has only </p><p>an advisory role (ref A), is customarily the formal venue at </p><p>which the Turkish military sets guidelines and, if deemed </p><p>necessary, issues warnings to the elected government about </p><p>what is fair or foul in Turkish politics.  For instance, </p><p>after the rise to power of Turkey\'s Islamist Refah Party-led </p><p>government in 1996, the NSC let it be known publicly that </p><p>Islamic "reactionaries" constituted a primary threat to </p><p>national security (alongside the then-active armed insurgency </p><p>of the PKK).  A similar warning about the threat of </p><p>"nationalist mafia" was issued in 1999, after the Nationalist </p><p>Movement Party (MHP) joined the coalition then led by Bulent </p><p>Ecevit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) A former NSC staffer, who also served with the </p><p>military\'s West Working Group that helped execute the </p><p>"postmodern" coup against the Refah government in 1997, </p><p>underscored what many others are also telling us: the </p><p>military is especially concerned that AK might try to amend </p><p>or re-write the 1982 constitution to change the "unamendable" </p><p>preamble and articles 1-4, which are designed to freeze </p><p>Turkey within narrow, if ambiguously defined,"secular" and </p><p>Ataturkist bounds.  Our contact vividly described the </p><p>atavistic fear among Turkish General Staff officers he knows </p><p>that AK, rather than accommodating to the military and </p><p>remainder of the Establishment, will try to transform THEM in </p><p>an Islamist way. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) A long-serving Justice of the Turkish Constitutional </p><p>Court (the Turkish Supreme Court) spoke similarly about the </p><p>approach of the military and other Establishment elements to </p><p>AK.  According to the Justice, the biggest problem in trying </p><p>to set guidelines lies in the ambiguous core of "secularism" </p><p>and Ataturk\'s principles.  The military\'s broad-brush </p><p>approach to defining (or avoiding definition of) its terms </p><p>runs the risk of creating a crisis; AK could, in theory, </p><p>cross a military "red line" without knowing where it is. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) The Justice noted that such "guidance" runs contrary </p><p>to democratic values and has an enormous impact not only on </p><p>the elected political class but on judicial decisionmaking, </p><p>which tends to focus more on preserving the ideological </p><p>status quo than on individual rights and political liberty. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) In assessing the developing relationship between AK </p><p>and the military, the Ozkok factor will be as significant as </p><p>the character of Erdogan.  Ozkok is reportedly among the more </p><p>open-minded military leaders (among other things, he fasts </p><p>during Ramazan).  Since 1996 Turkish dialogue between Prime </p><p>Ministers and TGS Chiefs has been limited.  Despite the </p><p>difficulty of establishing such a dialogue, it would be to </p><p>Turkey\'s benefit if AK and Turkey\'s military leadership could </p><p>establish an easier dialogue.  In that context, some AK </p><p>leaders recognize that Arinc\'s actions -- designed to </p><p>demonstrate not only his support for grassroots interests but </p><p>his independence as Speaker from party leader Erdogan and AK </p><p>government policies -- were ill-timed.  The headscarf flap </p><p>not only stimulated angst among the generals, it also handed </p><p>military hardliners an issue right at the gate. </p><p>8. (C) AK sees itself as representing the aspirations of the </p><p>majority of Turks for cleaner and more just governance, </p><p>including on social policies.  AK also wants to get away from </p><p>what it has characterized as an ingrained preference for a </p><p>"no solution" approach on Cyprus and other foreign policy </p><p>questions.  In the latter regard, Turkey seemed to take an </p><p>initial step forward on the UN\'s Cyprus plan because AK </p><p>leader Erdogan was willing to take a fresh look at what had </p><p>become "policies of the State" in the MFA spokesman\'s words, </p><p>i.e., policies which no government should touch.  AK is </p><p>rapidly finding out that moving the entrenched interests of </p><p>the Establishment is not easy and it remains to be seen </p><p>whether AK can forge an active approach on reform, Cyprus, </p><p>and other issues of central concern to the U.S. which is </p><p>digestable by the military and other elements of the State. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
