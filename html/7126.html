<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ZAGREB 000756 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EUR, EUR/SCE AND S/WCI </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR JOHNSON/KAYE/WHEATON </p><p> </p><p>    E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/04/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, HR, ICTY, War Crimes </p><p>SUBJECT: ICTY/CROATIA: CROATIA APPEARS TO MEET COOPERATION </p><p>DEADLINES </p><p> </p><p>REF: ZAGREB 717 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF ROB SILBERSTEIN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ICTY ZAGREB RESREP THOMAS OSORIO TOLD US LATE APRIL 4 </p><p>THAT THE GOC APPEARS TO HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE HAGUE\'S APRIL </p><p>4 DEADLINES TO SERVE THE SEPTEMBER 2002 INDICTMENT ON GENERAL </p><p>JANKO BOBETKO OR HIS LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE AND TO HONOR OTP </p><p>DOCUMENT REQUESTS.  OSORIO SAID HE WAS INFORMED THAT </p><p>OFFICIALS FROM THE GOC OFFICE FOR COOPERATION WITH THE </p><p>TRIBUNAL SERVED THE INDICTMENT ON BOBETKO\'S ATTORNEY.  THE </p><p>CROATIAN AMBASSADOR IN THE HAGUE HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED TO </p><p>INFORM THE ICTY REGISTRAR OF CROATIA\'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE </p><p>ICTY JUDGE\'S ORDER ON THE BOBETKO CASE.  THE GOC DECISION TO </p><p>SERVE THE INDICTMENT CAME AFTER THE PRESIDING JUDGE IN THE </p><p>ZAGREB COUNTY COURT, CITING BOBETKO\'S SEVERE MEDICAL </p><p>CONDITION, REFUSED TO SERVE THE INDICTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) OSORIO ALSO CONFIRMED THAT AMBASSADOR KRNIC, HEAD OF </p><p>THE GOC OFFICE FOR COOPERATION, TRANSMITTED LATE APRIL 4 A </p><p>THICK SET OF DOCUMENTS ON CROATIAN MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN </p><p>BOSNIA DURING THE WAR.  THE PACKAGE ALSO CONTAINED A LETTER </p><p>OF COMMITMENT, BINDING THE GOC TO PROVIDE OUTSTANDING BANKING </p><p>DOCUMENTS.  OSORIO SAID THAT THE OTP HAS INFORMED THE GOC </p><p>THAT CHIEF PROSECUTOR DEL PONTE HAS ACCEPTED THE GOC OFFER TO </p><p>VISIT ZAGREB.  DEL PONTE HAS PROPOSED APRIL 17 FOR THE VISIT. </p><p></p><p>3. (C) BARRING A MIRACULOUS RECOVERY BY THE 83-YEAR OLD </p><p>GENERAL, THE GOC\'S SERVING OF THE INDICTMENT EFFECTIVELY </p><p>CLOSES THE BOBETKO CASE.  ALTHOUGH THE GOC APPEARS TO HAVE </p><p>RESPONDED ADEQUATELY TO THE OTP DOCUMENT DEADLINE, THE DEVIL </p><p>IS IN THE DETAILS.  OSORIO SAID THAT THE  TRIBUNAL </p><p>INVESTIGATORS NOW MUST ANALYZE THE CONTENTS OF THE GOC </p><p>SUBMISSION.  A PACKAGE OF DOCUMENTS THAT OSORIO HAD REVIEWED </p><p>INFORMALLY ON APRIL 1 AT CROATIAN MOD ARCHIVES DID NOT </p><p>FULFILL OTP NEEDS.  THE OTP WOULD COMPLETE ITS ANALYSIS OF </p><p>THE GOC SUBMISSION BY APRIL 10. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) ACCORDING TO OSORIO, THE GOC\'S SERVING OF THE </p><p>INDICTMENT, PARTICULARLY AFTER MAINTAINING THAT THIS WAS THE </p><p>ROLE OF THE CROATIAN COURTS, IS SIGNIFICANT.  BY DOING SO -- </p><p>IN OSORIO\'S VIEW -- THE GOC ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE TRIBUNAL </p><p>HAS PRIMACY OVER THE RULINGS OF CROATIAN COURTS.  TIME WILL </p><p>TELL AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE GOC AGREES THAT ITS ACTION IS </p><p>PRECEDENT SETTING.  WHAT IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, IS THAT WITH THE </p><p>U.S. AND EU MAKING IT CLEAR THAT ICTY COOPERATION IS A SIN </p><p>QUA NON FOR EURO-ATLANTIC INTEGRATION, AND WITH PM RACAN </p><p>SCHEDULED TO TRAVEL TO ATHENS ON APRIL 15 TO GET THE EU\'S </p><p>"AVIS," THE ICTY/OTP FIRM DEADLINES NO DOUBT SPURRED A </p><p>RELUCTANT GOC TO ACT. </p><p>ROSSIN </p><p> </p><p>NNNN </p><p></p></div>
