<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 000516 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR J. FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR C. GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR C. NEARY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR T. PFLAUMER </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/01/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, ASEC, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: BOMB ATTACKS PLANNED: LOW-LEVEL MDC INTELLIGENCE </p><p>OFFICIAL </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d </p><p> </p><p>Summary: </p><p>-------- </p><p>1. (S) Charles Mutama, Harare regional coordinator for </p><p>intelligence for the MDC, reported to Poloff that the </p><p>Security, Intelligence, and Youth branches of the MDC are </p><p>planning bomb attacks on police stations, militia bases, and </p><p>ZANU-PF-owned shops and gas stations in five cities around </p><p>the country in the coming weeks.  While Mutama has in the </p><p>past been a reliable source, we have no independent </p><p>confirmation that the MDC leadership authorizes the plan, and </p><p>no information on the capability of anyone in the MDC to </p><p>execute such attacks.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Charles Mutama, who identifies himself as Harare </p><p>regional coordinator for intelligence for the MDC, reported </p><p>to Poloff today that the Security, Intelligence, and Youth </p><p>branches of the MDC are planning dynamite and petrol bomb </p><p>attacks on police stations, militia bases, and ZANU-PF-owned </p><p>shops and gas stations in five cities around the country in </p><p>the coming weeks. </p><p> </p><p>Long-time Contact </p><p>----------------- </p><p>3. (S) Mutama, who has been known to the Political Section </p><p>for some time, was recruited into the MDC from the student </p><p>movement in 2000, along with MP Job Sikhala.  He said he </p><p>received training in Uganda around that time, but did not </p><p>describe the training.  He was tortured along with Job </p><p>Sikhala on January 14--the resulting burns and scars are </p><p>still visible.  Mutama said he reports to the number two in </p><p>MDC Intelligence, who in turn reports to MDC Intelligence </p><p>Head Solomon Chikowero.  He said Chikowero was briefing MDC </p><p>Deputy Secretary General Gift Chimanikire on the planned </p><p>attacks. </p><p> </p><p>Call to Action Misinterpreted as Call to Attack ? </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>4. (S) We have heard from a variety of MDC sources that there </p><p>are plans to organize mass action for as early as March 13, </p><p>but more likely about two weeks later due to incomplete </p><p>planning.  Mutama said that the Intelligence, Security, and </p><p>Youth branches are interpreting the call to mass action as a </p><p>call for confrontational activities such as attacking the </p><p>types of targets listed above.  His particular role was to </p><p>identify targets in Harare.  He said that plans for the </p><p>Harare activities were incomplete, but in good shape, however </p><p>he was not sure of the status of plans for attacks in </p><p>Bulawayo, Mutare, Gweru and Masvingo. </p><p> </p><p>Targets Identified but Plans Incomplete </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>5. (S) He said he had identified 41 police stations, several </p><p>businesses from a list of ZANU-PF-owned businesses supplied </p><p>by the MDC Information Department, including several gas </p><p>stations in Harare owned by ZANU-PF officials.  He mentioned </p><p>that the planning for attacks on most police stations in the </p><p>Harare area were in good shape except for several police </p><p>stations in the low-density suburbs, as MDC youths were not </p><p>well represented in those areas.  He mentioned specifically </p><p>that a gas station in Harare suburb of Highfield owned by </p><p>ZANU-PF former Harare mayor Solomon Tawengwa, and a slew of </p><p>Exor gas stations in the Harare area owned by ZANU-PF MP </p><p>Savior Kasukuwere, were on the list, as well as other ZANU-PF </p><p>owned shops.  He also mentioned that employees of the Tel-One </p><p>central telephone switch house on Samora Machel Ave. and 2nd </p><p>Street in downtown Harare had identified phone circuits </p><p>associated with police stations and senior ZANU-PF officials, </p><p>and would disable those circuits at a critical moment.  He </p><p>said that most of the more senior people involved in the </p><p>planning had police or military backgrounds, but that the </p><p>actual attacks would be carried out by MDC youths. </p><p> </p><p>6. (S) He commented that while plans were well underway, </p><p>preparations were nevertheless incomplete, or at least he was </p><p>unaware of all the details.  He said he thought the MDC </p><p>leadership planning the attacks had not thought through the </p><p>whole scenario very well; for example, he anticipated there </p><p>would be reprisals by GOZ authorities, but no one had </p><p>suggested a plan for dealing with those.  He said the goal of </p><p>the activities was to pressure the GOZ to hold fresh </p><p>elections, to re-open negotiations with the MDC leadership, </p><p>and to galvanize the public behind the MDC.  He said he </p><p>thought the MDC leadership was motivated to plan such </p><p>activities by recent press reports criticizing Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai for taking an ineffective armchair approach in </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>comparison to the more confrontational approach of National </p><p>Constitutional Assembly (NCA) Director Lovemore Madhuku, </p><p>Harare MDC Mayor Elias Mudzuri, and maverick MDC MP Job </p><p>Sikhala. </p><p> </p><p>USG Would Not Condone Violence </p><p>------------------------------ </p><p>7. (S) Poloff responded that the Embassy and USG would not </p><p>support any violent activities, that such activities would </p><p>not motivate the GOZ to re-open negotiations with the MDC and </p><p>instead would most likely justify a violent crackdown against </p><p>the party.  Poloff said the Embassy would support peaceful </p><p>mass action involving as many Zimbabweans as possible, and </p><p>that this represents the democratic process.  Violent actions </p><p>by a few individuals does not represent democracy, would </p><p>jeopardize all that the MDC stood for, and was a bad idea. </p><p>Mutama responded that while he was involved in the planning, </p><p>he didn\'t think he could head off the initiative, which he </p><p>suggested had wide appeal. </p><p> </p><p>8. (S) Mutama is a longtime Embassy contact who called on </p><p>Poloff to ask his advice on whether he should accept an </p><p>invitation to go to South Africa for torture counseling at </p><p>this critical moment.  Poloff\'s questions about why the </p><p>moment was critical lead to Mutama revealing the above. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: </p><p>-------- </p><p>9. (S) Mutama is a fairly low-level MDC official, but </p><p>nevertheless levelheaded and soft-spoken, almost bookish.  He </p><p>is not one of the ones who would actually carry out the </p><p>attacks, but his sincerity suggests he is describing a </p><p>planning process that is actually under discussion.  We are </p><p>aware that he may be testing the waters for this plan on </p><p>behalf of either the CIO (in the wake of his torture) or the </p><p>MDC, and will make discreet inquiries as to his legitimacy. </p><p>It is very likely that some members of the MDC are frustrated </p><p>and angry and would like to bomb ZANU-PF facilities, but we </p><p>have no independent confirmation that the MDC leadership </p><p>authorizes the plan.  We also doubt that the MDC is actually </p><p>capable of executing such attacks, especially on the scale </p><p>that Mutama described.  Similar past warnings by anti-Mugabe </p><p>individuals that violent anti-government actions were </p><p>imminent have not panned out.  We are dubious that this one </p><p>will either, but will continue to follow this threat as </p><p>closely as discretion permits and will urge the MDC at </p><p>multiple levels not to engage in violent acts.  End Comment. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
