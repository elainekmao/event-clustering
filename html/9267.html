<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 004299 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/09/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: PRESS BEGINS TO QUESTION TURKISH MILITARY </p><p>ACTIVITIES IN IRAQ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. ANKARA 4278 </p><p>     B. ANKARA 4240 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason:1.5(b)(d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Turkish press\' sensationalist reaction to July </p><p>4 U.S. arrest (and subsequent release) of Turkish special </p><p>forces soldiers in Iraq shifted somewhat July 9.  Even </p><p>mainstream secularist journalists have begun to  question what </p><p>the Turkish military is or may have been doing in Iraq. </p><p>Responding to harsh criticism of the AK Government for its </p><p>supposed "submissive" stance toward the U.S. (ref A), F.M. Gul </p><p>sounded a slightly tougher note; privately, AK officials </p><p>assert to us that the incident is clarifying the need to rein </p><p>in the TGS/military and bring it under civilian control. </p><p>Establishment standard-bearer "Cumhuriyet," well-connected to </p><p>senior military leadership, highlights what it calls a </p><p>growing </p><p>"crisis" between the relatively conciliatory AK and the TGS. </p><p>Meanwhile, press conspiracy spinners continue to allege USG </p><p>ties to the terrorist PKK/KADEK.  Papers also note that the </p><p>"Armenian genocide" issue is likely to further aggravate U.S. </p><p>-Turkey relations.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Gen. Jones\' Visit </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The press characterized the July 8 visit of SACEUR/ </p><p>CINCUSEUR General Jones as an effort to "mollify" the Turks. </p><p>The press also reported that the contentious issue of </p><p>representation on the joint fact-finding commission (TGS </p><p>rejected the U.S.\'s initial candidate) had been resolved.  All </p><p>papers report that the commission will begin its work in </p><p>Ankara </p><p>July 9.  The Ambassador\'s comments to the Anatolian Press </p><p>Service reinforcing the U.S. commitment to a quick, fair, and </p><p>transparent inquiry and describing the Jones visit as a </p><p>positive </p><p>step received wide and accurate coverage. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p>Establishment Press Suspicions About the Turkish Military </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------------ </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Leading columnists are beginning to question the nature </p><p>of Turkish Special Forces\' (TSF) activities in Iraq and their </p><p>role in the current situation.  "Hurriyet" editor-in-chief </p><p>Ertugrul Ozkok, who had previously condemned the U.S. action </p><p>in </p><p>the strongest terms, today acknowledged that the Turks have </p><p>some explaining to do.  Ozkok questioned why explosive </p><p>material </p><p>was discovered in the Special Forces office and why members </p><p>of </p><p>the unit generally wore civilian clothes.  The pro-West </p><p>liberal </p><p>Cuneyt Ulsever, another widely-followed "Hurriyet" columnist, </p><p>raised similar questions and cast doubt on whether the AK </p><p>Government was aware of what the TSF were doing.  Muharrem </p><p>Sarikaya, center-left "Sabah" Ankara bureau chief and a </p><p>staunch </p><p>supporter of the military, also raised the alleged presence </p><p>of </p><p>explosives in the local TSF office, and asserted that the </p><p>"mystery" behind the crisis will now be solved in Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Secularist establishment standard-bearer "Cumhuriyet" </p><p>ran a front-page story on "the Gul crisis," noting the </p><p>divergence of statements by TGS Chief General Ozkok, who, the </p><p>paper points out, said he does not believe the action was a </p><p>"local event" (ref B), and F.M. Gul, who has repeatedly </p><p>asserted that Washington had no prior knowledge of the action. </p><p>Center-left "Milliyet" achieved the same purpose of </p><p>highlighting the different approaches of the TGS and AK </p><p>Government by putting an angry threat of revenge from the </p><p>military and the government\'s cool-handed approach on facing </p><p>center-fold pages. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Most papers carried FM Gul\'s subsequent comments on the </p><p>floor of Parliament, offered in respose to a query from the </p><p>opposition pro-Establishment CHP, which asserted that AK </p><p>Government had hurt "Turkish national honor."  Gul replied </p><p>that </p><p>"it is ridiculous to think that the Turkish Armed Forces are </p><p>involved in terrorist activity."  He added that "it is the </p><p>United States, not Turkey, that has lost" from this incident. </p><p>Separately, papers quoted P.M. Erdogan as saying simply that </p><p>the incident was "unfortunate." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) In private meetings with us, AK officials continue to </p><p>seek USG moral support and underscore the need to improve </p><p>bilateral ties.  AK Diyarbakir M.P. Cavit Torun approached us </p><p>July 9 asking what "we" -- AK and the USG -- "could do about </p><p>the Turkish military."  Separately, AK M.P. Irfan Gunduz, a </p><p>personal friend of Gul and like him a representative of </p><p>Kayseri (Gul\'s geographic political base), asserted to us </p><p>that, in fact, the Turkish military would suffer in the eyes </p><p>of the public for what it had done in Iraq.  Moreover, Gunduz </p><p>added, the latest incidents make it even more imperative that </p><p>AK pursue its reform agenda and end the military\'s unchecked </p><p>dominance over the Turkish State by bringing it under real </p><p>civilian control. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>No U.S. Apology, Plenty of Conspiracy Theories </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Both "Hurriyet" and "Radikal" carried articles </p><p>suggesting that the United States is neither backing off its </p><p>claims that the operation was justified nor preparing to </p><p>apologize.  "Hurriyet" cited U.S. officials in Washington who </p><p>state that Turkey has not been a reliable NATO partner. </p><p>Inaccurately, the paper asserts the officials claim that the </p><p>Turks refused to grant emergency landing permission to a U.S. </p><p>plane struck by enemy fire.  Islam-oriented "Yeni Safak" </p><p>latched on to the conspiracy theory that the U.S. action was </p><p>intended to protect the PKK from Turkish Special Forces and </p><p>then use the PKK against the Iranian regime.  Conspiratorial </p><p>thinking was also evident in reports of an assassination </p><p>attempt yesterday against the Governor of the southeastern </p><p>province of Tunceli.  "Hurriyet" noted on its front page that </p><p>"while the U.S. claims that Turks plotted to kill a Kurdish </p><p>governor, the PKK/KADEK carried out an attack against the </p><p>governor of Tunceli."  "Cumhuriyet" juxtaposed the story of </p><p>the failed assassination with a claim that the source of the </p><p>current controversy in Iraq stems from the U.S. failure to </p><p>deal effectively with the PKK threat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>Detentions over, "Genocide" Coming... </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) All papers reported that the current crisis is likely </p><p>to deepen this week with the likely passage of an Armenian </p><p>genocide resolution by the U.S. Senate.  As a headline in </p><p>"Milliyet" put it, "Detentions are Over, but Genocide is </p><p>Coming." </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
