<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 COLOMBO 001995 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR D, P, T AND SA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/25/2012 </p><p>TAGS: MARR, PREL, MASS, PGOV, PTER, PHUM, CE, Human Rights, LTTE - Peace Process </p><p>SUBJECT: ENGAGING THE SRI LANKAN MILITARY AFTER DOD </p><p>ASSESSMENTS </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR E.A. WILLS; REASONS 1.5 (b, d) </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S)  DOD has just completed three major assessments of </p><p>the SL military.  These assessments make plain that the Sri </p><p>Lankan military forms a central component of the GSL\'s </p><p>strategy to secure peace in the country after 20 years of </p><p>civil war.  The GSL needs the support of the military to make </p><p>peace work here.  The GSL, in turn, wants and needs American </p><p>engagement with the military to help ensure that support, and </p><p>to make Sri Lanka\'s armed services more professional, more </p><p>respectful of human rights and less vulnerable to the </p><p>blandishments of Sinhalese extremists.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  Over the past several weeks, three separate DOD </p><p>assessment teams have visited Sri Lanka:  NDU, which looked </p><p>at military education; PACCOM, which assessed operational and </p><p>equipment matters; and DPE, which evaluated doctrinal issues. </p><p>Although we await submission of the teams\' final reports, </p><p>some dominant themes have emerged from the preliminary </p><p>assessments as they were briefed to the CT: </p><p> </p><p>--  the GSL has no national security or national military </p><p>strategy; </p><p> </p><p>--  the military has pursued a war-fighting strategy almost </p><p>devoid of accurate, real-time tactical intelligence; </p><p> </p><p>--  widespread recognition exists that the SL military has </p><p>followed outdated doctrines and a defensive strategy, </p><p>including maritime interdiction, for which it is ill-equipped </p><p>and undermanned; </p><p> </p><p>--the military has been severely handicapped by the lack of a </p><p>merit-based personnel system and by very limited professional </p><p>education opportunities. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  As we have noted in our prior reporting, the </p><p>military plays a key role in the GSL\'s ongoing peace effort. </p><p>The military\'s support of or at least acquiescence to the </p><p>ceasefire, negotiations with the LTTE, and loosening of the </p><p>once-restrictive security environment that characterized Sri </p><p>Lanka is essential for the GSL to keep the Sinhalese majority </p><p>on-side.  The GSL, again as we have reported at length, has </p><p>come to us for help in maintaining the military\'s support, by </p><p>holding out to it the hope of having its serious deficiencies </p><p>rectified.  The GSL wants a modern, confident military </p><p>willing to take a chance on peace because it knows it could </p><p>prevail, or come a lot closer to prevailing than it ever has </p><p>before, if war resumed.  In addition, of course, the presence </p><p>of such a military induces the LTTE to continue down the path </p><p>of peace.  Velluparai Prabhakaran only respects strength and </p><p>exploits weakness.  Thus, it is in the GSL\'s interest, and </p><p>ours, to have a strong Sri Lankan military. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (S)  If we intend to help the GSL modernize and </p><p>professionalize its military, we need to respond to </p><p>reasonable requests for military assistance.  The ongoing and </p><p>very effective JCET and other exercise/training/education </p><p>programs, including in human rights, need to continue and </p><p>even pick up.  But even more critical, we will need to help </p><p>the military deal with at least some of the deficiencies our </p><p>assessment teams have identified.  Most of those deficiencies </p><p>have to do with structure, doctrine, and training.  To </p><p>address some, however, the SL military needs modern military </p><p>equipment, some of which the US is best positioned to </p><p>provide.  In particular, the Navy needs a variety of gear </p><p>that will enable it to patrol and protect the country\'s </p><p>coastline and territorial waters from poachers, smugglers, </p><p>and LTTE resupply efforts.  The Air Force and Navy need </p><p>proper training and equipment to conduct SAR operations in </p><p>case of a downed aircraft (military or civilian) or a </p><p>foundered ship. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (S)  There are many, many more examples of potential </p><p>equipment needs that the assessment report from PACCOM will </p><p>cite.  We know that we cannot address all of the deficiencies </p><p>and that the GSL military will never become a "Mini-Me" </p><p>version of the US military.  We do, however, think that with </p><p>appropriate help from us (and, perhaps others) the SL </p><p>military can continue to evolve into a pro-American </p><p>institution that respects human rights and is ready, willing </p><p>and able to play a full and effective role in Sri Lanka\'s </p><p>national security strategy and, later on, in international </p><p>peacekeeping efforts. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C)  As soon as we have received all the assessments we </p><p>would like to re-engage with Washington agencies on how best </p><p>to address the SL military\'s pressing needs.  We understand </p><p>the the 04 budget allotments for FMF for Sri Lanka are fixed. </p><p> But we wonder whether an 03 supplemental could include </p><p>additional FMF funds to permit the USG to engage with the GSL </p><p>military. </p><p>WILLS </p><p></p></div>
