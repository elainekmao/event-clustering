<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L AMMAN 001981 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TFIZO1: 104 (LESS PROMINENT) JORDANIANS SIGN </p><p>SECOND LETTER SUPPORTING KING ABDULLAH\'S ANTI-WAR EFFORTS </p><p> </p><p>REF: AMMAN 1954 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>DUELING LETTERS </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C)  On April 2nd, Al Arab Al Yawm newspaper published a </p><p>second letter addressed to King Abdullah.  The letter </p><p>contains one basic point -- the signatories support the </p><p>King\'s handling of the war and his continuing efforts to stop </p><p>the "aggression" against Iraq.  The letter also praises the </p><p>King\'s wise and brave leadership.  The letter\'s signatories </p><p>include both prominent and lesser known Jordanians, but the </p><p>list generally lacks the luster of those who signed the March </p><p>31 letter (reftel).  Among the signers are ex </p><p>parliamentarians, a former speaker of the Lower House, </p><p>businessmen and prominent tribal leaders.  We note that, </p><p>while this letter calls for efforts to stop the war, it does </p><p>not mention the U.S. or UK. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>IT\'S ABOUT THE KING\'S LEGITIMACY </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C)  PolCouns spoke April 2 with Naif Mawla, former MP </p><p>and signatory of the second letter.  Mawla said that he had </p><p>been shown the draft of the first letter, but -- although he </p><p>opposes the war in Iraq -- had declined to associate himself </p><p>with it because of its implied questioning of the King\'s </p><p>legitimacy.  After the publication of the first letter, Mawla </p><p>said, he and several other pro-Hashemite politicians -- we </p><p>suspect in cooperation with the Palace -- decided to draft a </p><p>second letter to show their support for the King\'s stand. </p><p>Mawla, at several points during the conversation, said he </p><p>hoped that Jordan would be able to benefit economically in </p><p>the new Iraq.  No one will miss Saddam Hussein, he assured </p><p>us. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  King Abdullah, while never directly addressing the </p><p>first letter, expressed April 1 his support for the measures </p><p>undertaken by the government during the "difficult </p><p>circumstances" in the region.  The King expressed "deep </p><p>concern" over the rise in civilian casualties and called upon </p><p>the government to make every effort to guarantee the </p><p>protection of Iraqi civilians.  Lastly, the King praised </p><p>Jordanians for how "responsible" they have been during past </p><p>demonstrations. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The appearance of the second letter -- whether </p><p>orchestrated by the Palace or not -- should reduce the sting </p><p>of the first letter somewhat.  The King\'s April 1 statement </p><p>in support of the government\'s efforts seems designed to </p><p>counter the idea that the government is not doing anything to </p><p>act on the rage and sorrow felt by most Jordanians.  We </p><p>expect to see other such statements in the days ahead. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
