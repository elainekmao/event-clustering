<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KATHMANDU 000477 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR SA/INS </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/ERIEDEL </p><p>NSC FOR MILLARD </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/12/2008 </p><p>TAGS: PINS, PTER, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: MAOISTS IN WESTERN NEPAL DISCUSS TERMS OF </p><p>CEASE-FIRE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Robert K. Boggs for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p>Summary </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) On March 4, a non-governmental organization held a </p><p>meeting with Maoist, government, and social organization </p><p>representatives in Jumla, a district headquarters in Nepal\'s </p><p>mid-western hills.  The Maoists tentatively agreed to end </p><p>extortion and allow for the free movement of political </p><p>parties and the resumption of development programs, although </p><p>these concessions must be approved by top Maoist leaders </p><p>before being operative.  The Maoists refused to put aside </p><p>their arms or to quit holding mass meetings, while the army </p><p>and police refused to return to their barracks.  Notably, </p><p>local government and Maoist representatives agreed to resolve </p><p>potential flash-points through discussion, although the </p><p>details of this mechanism have yet to be finalized.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Talks on Talks: INSEC Brings 25 Parties to the Table in Jumla </p><p>============================================= ================ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) On March 4, Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), </p><p>a non-governmental organization (NGO) affiliated with the </p><p>Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (UML), held </p><p>a meeting with a regional Maoist leader and 25 government and </p><p>social organizations.  The meeting was held in the Local </p><p>Development Office in Jumla district headquarters.  A </p><p>spontaneous crowd of 200 people gathered at the site to watch </p><p>the interaction.  (Note: The police speculate that armed </p><p>Maoist security personnel were hiding among the spectators.) </p><p>Econoff arrived the following day and was able to talk with </p><p>many of the participants, including the Local Representative </p><p>of INSEC and organizer of the meeting; the Chief District </p><p>Officer (CDO); the Deputy Superintendent of Police; and a </p><p>local spokesperson for the UML.  The Maoists were represented </p><p>by the Chief of the District Intellectual Committee. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The INSEC organizer reported that it had taken him </p><p>ten days to forge an agreement to meet between the Maoists </p><p>and the Chief District Office.  Most of that time was spent </p><p>in working through the hierarchy of Maoist contacts.  An </p><p>agenda was not approved in advance, and the INSEC forum was </p><p>open for all participants to air their grievances. </p><p> </p><p>Local Code of Conduct: A Reflection of National Debate </p><p>============================================= ========= </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) During his opening remarks, the Maoists\' </p><p>representative objected to the presence of an armed police </p><p>officer, but agreed to proceed.  (Note: The meeting was held </p><p>100 feet from the officer\'s home and adjacent to the police </p><p>headquarters.)  The attendees then presented a list of </p><p>demands to the Maoists, including: </p><p>-- Freedom of movement for mainstream political party members; </p><p>-- Non-interference with development projects; and </p><p>-- An end to Maoist extortion, carrying of arms, and mass </p><p>meetings. </p><p>The Maoists in response requested that the Royal Nepal Army </p><p>(RNA), not represented at the meeting, and the police return </p><p>to their barracks and allow the Maoists free movement in all </p><p>areas of the district. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (U) The UML representative demanded an apology from the </p><p>Maoists for the November attack on Jumla and an explanation </p><p>of what the Maoists had expected to gain.  His request was </p><p>met by silence.  The representative of the lower castes took </p><p>the opportunity to protest the Maoist practice of impressing </p><p>low-caste people into work as porters.  If people do not </p><p>agree to work for the Maoists, they will be killed; if they </p><p>do, they could be shot by security forces as Maoist </p><p>sympathizers, he complained.  The Maoist representative </p><p>stated only that there was no longer a need for porter </p><p>services during the cease-fire. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) According to the INSEC organizer, the Maoists </p><p>conceded in principle to the free movement of political party </p><p>members; to non-interference in development projects, if they </p><p>are given sufficient notice; and to stop fund raising. </p><p>However, the Maoist refused to put aside weapons or stop </p><p>organizing mass meetings.  Most importantly, the police and </p><p>the Maoists agreed to put in place a mechanism through which </p><p>disputes in the field can be resolved through dialogue rather </p><p>than violence.  The details of the mechanism, including the </p><p>forum, ground rules, and representatives, have yet to be </p><p>established.  The Maoist told the other participants that the </p><p>concessions requested of them must be reviewed by the central </p><p>Maoist leadership before agreement could be confirmed.  He </p><p>would schedule a mass meeting the next week, he said, to </p><p>announce the decisions of the Maoist party. </p><p> </p><p>UML Touting the Party Line Despite Threats </p><p>========================================== </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The UML representative told econoff that during the </p><p>meeting the Maoists demonstrated flexibility, while the </p><p>government did not.  He accused the local government </p><p>representatives and the King of undermining the cease-fire by </p><p>not taking "positive steps."  When asked what those steps </p><p>were, he repeated the UML\'s standard demand for an all-party </p><p>interim government to replace the "illegitimate" government </p><p>of Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand.  Both the UML and </p><p>INSEC representatives related that the Maoists accused the </p><p>UML of undermining the peace process.  The Maoists reportedly </p><p>expect to become more powerful politically than the UML </p><p>through negotiations.  The Maoists suspect that the only way </p><p>for the UML to prevent this outcome is for the UML to </p><p>undermine the cease-fire.  The UML representative said he </p><p>fears for his life and the lives of UML cadre; therefore UML </p><p>cadres no longer venture outside Jumla and have developed </p><p>plans to leave the district if the cease-fire breaks down. </p><p> </p><p>More to Come </p><p>============ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) The INSEC organizer was very happy with the outcome </p><p>of the March 4 session and is working with the regional INSEC </p><p>office in Nepalgunj in the southwestern lowlands to organize </p><p>a mass interaction after the first round of anticipated peace </p><p>talks in Kathmandu.  The purpose will be to air the </p><p>grievances of all parties affected by the conflict in order </p><p>to make the peace agreement as broad based as possible. </p><p> </p><p>Comment </p><p>======= </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) Since the January 29 announcement of the cease-fire, </p><p>local Maoist representatives have held meetings with </p><p>politicians and members of civil society in a number of </p><p>districts as a way to improve their public image, which had </p><p>been badly damaged by a year of violent excesses.  The March </p><p>4 meeting in Jumla, although organized by an NGO, is another </p><p>example of the Maoists\' efforts to project themselves as a </p><p>responsible political party.  It is unlikely that the </p><p>discussions in Jumla have any implications for talks at the </p><p>national level, as many of the concessions reached in Jumla </p><p>had already been agreed to by the central Maoist leadership. </p><p>Too little time has elapsed to evaluate whether the </p><p>concessions on mass meetings and extorting funds will hold. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) Despite speculation by the vernacular press and </p><p>Embassy contacts of emerging political factions within the </p><p>Maoist movement, the near mirror-image demands of the Maoists </p><p>at local and national levels and the need for the local </p><p>representative to refer back to the center for approval </p><p>demonstrate a highly centralized political organization. </p><p>Whatever initiatives may be developed at the local level, </p><p>little progress can be made without the imprimatur of the </p><p>Maoist political hierarchy.  In any case, this example of </p><p>peaceful interaction between local Maoists and their recent </p><p>victims bears testimony to Maoist seriousness so far about </p><p>above-ground negotiations. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
