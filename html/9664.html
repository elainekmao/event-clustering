MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5 (D) </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 2. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Summary:  In order to expand its democracy training </p><p>and outreach, Embassy proposes to establish an American </p><p>Center Teaching Annex in Mandalay (see reftels), Burma\'s </p><p>second largest city and its geographic and cultural center. </p><p>The American Center Teaching Annex would enable post to </p><p>include significantly larger numbers of those supporting </p><p>political change in these regions in public diplomacy </p><p>outreach programs fostering democracy and civil society, a </p><p>core MPP goal.  The most recent GOB crackdown on opposition </p><p>parties throws into stark relief the need and utility of </p><p>another outreach channel to those organizations and </p><p>individuals. </p><p> </p><p>An OIG team visiting post in February applauded post,s plans </p><p>to expand outreach beyond the capital.  Among its draft key </p><p>judgments:  "The (Public Diplomacy) section continues to make </p><p>significant strides in its outreach efforts and conducts a </p><p>highly successful educational program in Rangoon."  The OIG </p><p>recommended that Post provide for the Department an analysis </p><p>of alternatives for establishing an outreach center in </p><p>Mandalay. </p><p> </p><p>Post herein offers an assessment of three possible options </p><p>for the establishment of the Mandalay outreach center: </p><p> </p><p>A) Opening an American Center Teaching Annex in USG-owned </p><p>property: Utilize former Mandalay Consulate property for the </p><p>Center and begin the program with four FSNs and two AmCit </p><p>grantees; </p><p> </p><p>B) Leasing the USG property to an Educational NGO to perform </p><p>outreach programs under a grant agreement: Have an American </p><p>educational NGO provide program activities similar to Public </p><p>Diplomacy programs at the USG-owned property; and </p><p> </p><p>C) Opening an American Center Teaching Annex as a Tenant in </p><p>Commercial Space: Rent commercial space in Mandalay, sell the </p><p>USG-owned property, and begin the program with four FSNs and </p><p>two AmCit grantees. </p><p> </p><p>Funding would need to come from a variety of sources, but </p><p>could include ESF from the "Burma Earmark" for democracy </p><p>programs.  In making this assessment, site visits to Mandalay </p><p>were conducted by the COM, DCM, PAO, GSO, and RSO, as well as </p><p>by two DS Regional Security Engineers, an OBO architect, and </p><p>the OIG team. </p><p> </p><p>ACTION REQUEST:  that the Department review the options and </p><p>select which, if any, it deems most appropriate and name a </p><p>point of contact to work with Post to implement the proposal. </p><p> End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>THE NEED FOR AN AMERICAN CENTER TEACHING ANNEX, MANDALAY </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Even before the May 30 ambush on Aung San Suu Kyi\'s </p><p>motorcade and the subsequent arrests of hundreds of democracy </p><p>supporters, Burma was a country subject to Orwellian </p><p>censorship and control by the military dictatorship.  There </p><p>is no free press, free speech, or right of assembly.  The </p><p>universities, historically a source of political activism, </p><p>have been virtually dismantled by the regime.  Graduating </p><p>high school students must wait more than a year before space </p><p>opens for them in a university "distance learning" program. </p><p>Thus, at precisely the time they are making life decisions </p><p>and are perhaps most open to influence, thousands of young </p><p>adults are turning to the American Center in Rangoon each </p><p>month to use the Library/Information Resource Center (IRC), </p><p>attend films or lectures, or join English language classes. </p><p>These English language classes have a high content of civil </p><p>society training, such as critical thinking, expressing </p><p>opinions and persuading others, mediating disputes and </p><p>conflicts, etc.  A number of the students in the English </p><p>language classes are former political prisoners, or </p><p>representatives of opposition political parties or minority </p><p>ethnic groups, who have been granted tuition waivers for the </p><p>classes. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) For the past year, through an ESF Burma Earmark grant, </p><p>post has been providing governance training and English </p><p>classes (eight hours a week) for seven to twelve opposition </p><p>leaders.  The program was begun at the request of opposition </p><p>leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the participants are her </p><p>hand-picked representatives -- predominantly MP\'s elected in </p><p>1990, but never seated -- her shadow Ministers and successors </p><p>to the aging party leadership.  Because of the importance of </p><p>this program to ASSK, she asked that the training be </p><p>continued for a second year.  During the first year of the </p><p>program, ASSK also sought to include party leaders and MP\'s </p><p>from other provinces.  A group of three Mandalay MP\'s moved </p><p>to Rangoon for two six week sessions, but were unable to keep </p><p>up with the main cohort because they could not be away for </p><p>long from party responsibilities in Mandalay.  Another group </p><p>including a Shan, a Mon, and a Karen party member were able </p><p>to come for just one session.  A clear benefit to </p><p>establishing a public diplomacy facility in Mandalay would be </p><p>to extend activities like this high priority (but stealth) </p><p>training program to NLD leadership in Mandalay and </p><p>neighboring states and divisions.  This is one reason ASSK </p><p>herself has endorsed establishing an American Center Teaching </p><p>Annex in Mandalay. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The enthusiastic reception ASSK received in Mandalay </p><p>and neighboring divisions, which led directly to the SPDC\'s </p><p>dastardly May 30 ambush and crackdown on the National League </p><p>for Democracy party leadership, demonstrates that there is a </p><p>groundswell of popular support for political change in these </p><p>regions.  All offices of the NLD (the only place party </p><p>members can legally assemble) have been closed.  If the GOB </p><p>experimentation with a longer leash for the opposition </p><p>parties is indeed over, and the NLD\'s freedom of activity is </p><p>curtailed, their ability to operate in the Mandalay region </p><p>and beyond will be severely restrained.  Post can best aid </p><p>democratization efforts, and our core MPP goal of a return to </p><p>democracy, by increasing the capacity (widening the pipeline) </p><p>to deliver training and information about the outside world </p><p>to these supporters of political change. </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The American Center Teaching Annex in Mandalay need </p><p>not be an open-ended commitment.  In the period before </p><p>democracy returns to Burma, and in the transition period, it </p><p>would be in a unique position to provide valuable training </p><p>for civil society organizations, particularly the democratic </p><p>opposition.  Once democracy returns, the USG could </p><p>investigate deeding the facility and its apparatus to a local </p><p>institution as a democracy think tank or an American Studies </p><p>Institute, as was done with many USIS libraries during the </p><p>1990\'s. </p><p> </p><p>OPTION A  OPENING AN AMERICAN CENTER ANNEX IN USG-OWNED </p><p>PROPERTY (FORMER MANDALAY CONSULATE) </p><p> </p><p>7. (SBU) Reftel A provided post,s rationale for opening an </p><p>American Center Annex at the former consulate building </p><p>Mandalay.  Reftels B and C, reported on the RSO,s security </p><p>survey of the site and on probable costs associated with </p><p>opening an American Center Annex there. </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) To recap, under Option A, the Teaching Annex would </p><p>be staffed by a combination of LES (4) in the </p><p>Library/Information Resource Center, and English </p><p>teachers/trainers (2) hired through a grant agreement, with </p><p>supervision from the PAO in Rangoon.  The former Consulate </p><p>building offers approximately 3700 square feet well </p><p>configured to function as a small American Center.  It could </p><p>include two teaching classrooms and a language/computer lab </p><p>in the upstairs rooms, and a Library reading room, reference </p><p>section, and office space in the downstairs rooms.  An OBO </p><p>architect, concluding a site visit in May, reported: "The </p><p>property is in excellent condition and would be well-suited </p><p>for use as an American Center," citing the building\'s </p><p>excellent location, accessibility, and setback. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS </p><p>9. (SBU) The RSO determined (see Ref B) that the building is </p><p>&in good to excellent condition8 has &excellent setback </p><p>and reasonably effective safe area/office complex.8  &Basic </p><p>structures are fundamentally sound and could be made </p><p>operational with appropriate upgrades and DS exceptions to </p><p>specific standards.8 </p><p> </p><p>10. (SBU) According to 12 FAH-6, H-020, Definition of Terms </p><p>the Annex would be a Public Office Facility. ("Facility, </p><p>which exists for public use or functions, such as libraries </p><p>and cultural centers.  It is located in a commercial or </p><p>residential building not collocated with the chancery or </p><p>consulate.  No classified material is maintained.  U.S. </p><p>Government may or may not be sole occupant.")  Thus it would </p><p>be governed by the physical security standards for "Public </p><p>Office Facilities" as provided by regulation 12 FAH-6, </p><p>H-111.8, Physical Security (Public Office Facilities - Such </p><p>as Libraries and Commercial Offices). </p><p> </p><p>11. (SBU) The current property was acquired prior to 1991 and </p><p>therefore falls in the category of an Existing Office </p><p>Building, 12 FAH-5, H-111, Differentiation Between Existing </p><p>and New Buildings; 12FAH-5, H-112, Existing Office Building </p><p>(EOB).  Thus, no waiver for collocation or setback is </p><p>required, according to SECCA, 1999, A.1, 00 State 82682.  ("A </p><p>quick reference checklist for waiver requirements involving </p><p>building collocation and setback follows: A. No waiver </p><p>required: 1) Existing U.S. diplomatic facilities as of 29 </p><p>November 1999....") </p><p> </p><p>12. (SBU) If this option is chosen, RSO is ready to prepare a </p><p>formal Site Survey and Security Upgrade Plan for the facility </p><p>utilizing 12 FAH-5 and 12 FAH-6 as specific guidelines. </p><p>These reports would provide DS the exact site layout, </p><p>recommended security upgrades, and define those physical </p><p>security standards that are not feasible as defined per </p><p>regulation.  This would satisfy the requirement of 12 FAH-5, </p><p>H-121.2, Exceptions to Standards, and serve as the </p><p>documentation to support a funding request for security </p><p>upgrades, 12 FAH-5, H-121.1, Applicability. </p><p> </p><p>FUNDING CONSIDERATIONS </p><p>13. (SBU) Reftel C discussed post,s estimates of funding </p><p>needs for this option.  Post estimated approximately $200,000 </p><p>in non-recurring expenses and about $95,000 in recurring </p><p>costs, including salaries for locally engaged staff.  English </p><p>teachers/trainers would be recruited through a grant to an </p><p>educational NGO, at additional cost.  (A similar grant </p><p>arrangement using Burma Earmark ESF is under consideration </p><p>this fiscal year to assist the Rangoon American Center\'s </p><p>English Teaching Program.) </p><p>14. (SBU) In Ref D, AID indicated to State Desk Officer its </p><p>estimation, after consultation with its Legal office, that of </p><p>the $295,000 post estimated would be needed for year one, </p><p>most could be covered by ESF.  (This may include costs for </p><p>furnishings, computers and telecommunications, generator, </p><p>electrical upgrade and maintenance costs, program materials, </p><p>books, janitorial, grounds keeping, utilities, and fuel.) </p><p> </p><p>15. (SBU) AID advised that non-project costs, such as raising </p><p>the perimeter fence and providing security guards, could not </p><p>be allocated to ESF.  Funds for this, which post estimated at </p><p>$45,000, will need to be found elsewhere.  Some recurring </p><p>costs such as LES salaries ($37,000) should come from PD </p><p>allotment.  PAO would request an increase in PD allotment </p><p>from EAP/PD to meet this new cost. </p><p> </p><p>OPTION B: LEASING THE USG PROPERTY TO AN EDUCATIONAL NGO TO </p><p>PERFORM OUTREACH PROGRAMS UNDER A GRANT AGREEMENT </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) The USG property (former Consulate Building) could </p><p>be leased to an international NGO active in Education </p><p>programs to run programs similar to Public Diplomacy </p><p>programs, but not under the direction of the country PAO. </p><p>Funds from the Burma earmark, with appropriate notification </p><p>to Congress, could be used in a multiyear grant to pay for </p><p>most startup and recurring costs associated with the project. </p><p> Security upgrades would not be required by law. </p><p> </p><p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POST AND GRANTEE </p><p>17. (SBU) The grantee NGO would administer a program with </p><p>aims similar to the country public diplomacy program, but </p><p>would not be under the supervision of the country PAO.   In </p><p>accordance with grants policy, the PAO could function as a </p><p>program officer to the grant, ensuring that the program is </p><p>being run in good faith, but could not provide day-to-day </p><p>direction.  PAS Rangoon could cooperate on programs and could </p><p>provide some materials and assistance to the grantee, as it </p><p>does to other local organizations </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) As part of the grant agreement, the USG could lease </p><p>the former consulate building to the NGO for a nominal fee of </p><p>$1 per year.  The facility would not be a diplomatic </p><p>installation, but may have a status equivalent to the British </p><p>Council, which has quietly operated a small reading room in </p><p>Mandalay for two years.  Post hopes that the grantee would </p><p>enjoy protection from GOB harassment because of its </p><p>affiliation with a diplomatic entity.  The NGO would have to </p><p>register with the Government of Burma. </p><p> </p><p>19. (SBU) The grantee could recruit and provide </p><p>teacher/trainers for the English language programs, and could </p><p>locally recruit a reference librarian and other clerical </p><p>support staff.  The grantee,s program could host speaker and </p><p>cultural presentations from PAS Rangoon on a quarterly basis. </p><p> The grantee could network with other civil society </p><p>organizations in Mandalay and help the PAO to identify </p><p>exchange participants from Mandalay and northern Burma.  The </p><p>grantee,s library staff could help disseminate PAS </p><p>Rangoon,s publications and products. </p><p>20. (SBU) The grantee could not be expected to perform the </p><p>policy advocacy role of a State Department public diplomacy </p><p>program. </p><p> </p><p>21. (C) In addition, without the diplomatic cover of the USG, </p><p>it is unclear whether the grantee could effectively run the </p><p>stealth governance program described in paragraph 4 above. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS </p><p>22. (SBU) By leasing the property to the NGO, the USG is no </p><p>longer obligated by regulation to bring the property up to </p><p>security standards mandated for USG diplomatic installations. </p><p> However, because the site has strong association with the </p><p>United States, and because American citizens may be among the </p><p>grantee,s staff, the place may run some risks of being a </p><p>target of terrorism, as do many American NGO\'s around the </p><p>world.  The Department will have to decide whether it has a </p><p>perceived obligation to provide the same security upgrades it </p><p>would to an American Center. </p><p>FUNDING CONSIDERATIONS </p><p>23. (SBU) By AID,s estimation, in consultation with its </p><p>Legal office, costs for furnishings, computers and </p><p>telecommunications, generator, electrical upgrade and </p><p>maintenance costs, program materials, books, annual staffing </p><p>costs, janitorial, grounds keeping, utilities, and fuel could </p><p>be covered by ESF.  Although most of the above will be </p><p>provided by the grantee, it might be expedient for post </p><p>(still using ESF) to provide procurement and importation of </p><p>furniture, computers, and other aspects of the facilities </p><p>upgrade. </p><p> </p><p>24. (SBU) AID advises that non-project costs, such as raising </p><p>the perimeter fence and providing security guards, could not </p><p>be allocated to ESF.  If these are deemed necessary, funds </p><p>will need to be found. </p><p>FINDING THE RIGHT GRANTEE </p><p>25.  (SBU) In preliminary discussions, post has not found a </p><p>grantee willing to take on such a novel arrangement.  The </p><p>representative of one large Educational NGO with extensive </p><p>worldwide experience, already in grant relationships with </p><p>both AID and State, has told PAO they would be willing to </p><p>provide English teachers to a USG operated facility in </p><p>Mandalay (as per Option A or C).  But the representative said </p><p>they would not be interested in taking on a challenge like </p><p>Option B &on our own.8  The well-known difficulties of </p><p>establishing a relationship with the GOB, together with the </p><p>controversy inherent in teaching English with a democracy </p><p>bent, apparently makes the risks outweigh the benefits for </p><p>this organization.  While there may be more zealous or less </p><p>experienced organizations willing to take up the challenge, </p><p>post would need to weigh the judiciousness of entering into a </p><p>close programming association with them. </p><p> </p><p>OPTION C OPENING AN AMERICAN CENTER ANNEX AS A TENANT IN </p><p>COMMERCIAL SPACE </p><p> </p><p>26. (SBU) In May, GSO, PAO, and RSO, accompanied by regional </p><p>Security Engineers, visited several commercial properties </p><p>available for rent in Mandalay.  GSO and PAO identified two </p><p>as best meeting requirements for the proposed program in </p><p>acceptable downtown mixed retail/residential areas. </p><p>Available commercial space affords no setback from road or </p><p>neighbors, and is often adjacent to open sewers or other </p><p>eyesores.  While rents are not high, there would be costs </p><p>associated with security upgrades and other modifications. </p><p> </p><p>27. (SBU) Property One is a new, four-story, reinforced </p><p>concrete structure, currently configured as living space, </p><p>sharing one half of the ground floor with a fast food retail </p><p>shop.  The ground floor hall has ample room to install a PAC. </p><p> With some modifications, the upper three floors could be </p><p>configured to serve as classrooms, office space, library </p><p>reading room, and event space.  Rent was quoted at </p><p>$1,000/month for 5880 square feet. </p><p> </p><p>28. (SBU) Property Two is a three-story space in a row of </p><p>similar shops in a new, reinforced concrete structure.  Most </p><p>are not yet occupied but are designed for street-level </p><p>retail, and mixed retail/residential above.  The first floor </p><p>could accommodate a PAC and office space, and the upper two </p><p>floors could accommodate a 1500 square foot library reading </p><p>room and two English teaching classrooms. Rent was quoted at </p><p>$2000/month for 4536 square feet.  There are many similar </p><p>rental spaces available in this newly redeveloped quarter of </p><p>Mandalay, which is a joint venture of the local government </p><p>and some (Chinese) businessmen. </p><p> </p><p>29. (SBU) In the interests of thoroughness, GSO and PAO also </p><p>investigated commercial space in Mandalay,s centrally </p><p>located hotels, but found nothing appropriate.  The Sedona </p><p>Hotel offered space configured as serviced apartments and </p><p>space designed for their own administrative offices </p><p>accessible only through a service stairway.  Access and space </p><p>configurations were problematic in both.  The Mandalay Swan </p><p>Hotel offered four adjoining shops spaces adjacent to the </p><p>hotel with a very pleasant entrance off quiet 68 th street. </p><p>The total space, under 1500 square feet, could accommodate </p><p>the teaching classrooms but the associated </p><p>library/information resource center program. </p><p> </p><p>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS </p><p>30. (SBU) As with every commercial property examined, there </p><p>is no setback from the street, or from neighboring buildings, </p><p>which are as near as six inches away.  Because of the high </p><p>price of land in central Mandalay, new structures are built </p><p>on their entire allowable footprint (and possibly beyond it). </p><p> The facility would be governed by the physical security </p><p>standards of 12 FAH-6, H-111.7 - Physical Security Tenant of </p><p>Commercial Office Space.  Collocation and setback waivers </p><p>would have to be sought. </p><p> </p><p>FUNDING CONSIDERATIONS </p><p>31. (SBU) Startup and recurring costs and possible sources of </p><p>funding would be similar to Option A, with the addition of </p><p>annual rent of $12,000 to $24,000.  Also, security upgrades </p><p>will be at least as expensive as for Option A, and possibly </p><p>higher. </p><p>THREE OPTIONS: PRO\'S AND CON\'S WEIGHED </p><p> </p><p>32. (SBU) Option A Pro,s and Con,s: </p><p>Pro,s: </p><p> </p><p>--  The attractive USG-owned facility is in good to excellent </p><p>repair, requiring little upgrading (other than security) and </p><p>reconfiguration. </p><p> </p><p>--  On a large parcel of land, it has excellent setback and </p><p>could be brought up to security standards with some outlay. </p><p> </p><p>--  USG-owned means no delay or harassment from local </p><p>authorities, also no additional recurring costs from rent </p><p>($12,000 ) $24,000/year). </p><p> </p><p>--  American Center Teaching Annex (vs. grant agreement with </p><p>NGO) means mission has control over all program content. </p><p> </p><p>--  Prime location for reaching target groups </p><p> </p><p>Con,s: </p><p> </p><p>--  Post will have large initial outlays for start-up and </p><p>security upgrade (but not necessarily larger than with other </p><p>options). </p><p> </p><p>33. (SBU) Option B Pro,s and Con,s </p><p>Pro\'s: </p><p> </p><p>--  No legal requirement for security upgrade. </p><p> </p><p>--  NGO programming would share most Country PD goals. </p><p> </p><p>--  More recurring costs, such as salaries, could be covered </p><p>by ESF through the grant agreement. </p><p> </p><p>Con\'s: </p><p> </p><p>--  Mission would not have supervisory role or control over </p><p>all program content. </p><p> </p><p>--  NGO could not play Policy Advocate role of PD. </p><p> </p><p>--  Without diplomatic or USG employee status, NGO, program, </p><p>and participants may be subject to more harassment by GOB and </p><p>local authorities. </p><p> </p><p>34. (SBU) Option C Pro,s and Con,s </p><p>Pro,s: </p><p> </p><p>--  The commercial space identified, though in some ways </p><p>inferior to the USG owned property in Mandalay, could be made </p><p>as serviceable. </p><p> </p><p>--  Locations are as good as the USG owned property. </p><p> </p><p>Con,s: </p><p> </p><p>--  Being a "tenant in commercial space" is meant to lower </p><p>the facility\'s desirability as a terrorism target because it </p><p>would entail too much collateral damage to other tenants. </p><p>But crowded urban locations afford more chances for </p><p>terrorists to hide.  With no setback from neighbors or the </p><p>street, these locations may be less secure than the USG owned </p><p>property set apart on a large parcel of land. </p><p> </p><p>--  Post will have to spend the same amount of dollars, if </p><p>not more, for necessary security upgrades on the rental </p><p>properties as on USG-owned property. </p><p> </p><p>--  Post will have to secure a setback waiver and other </p><p>waivers for the rental properties. </p><p> </p><p>--  With a rental property, post gives GOB and local </p><p>authorities an entry point for harassment.  The authorities </p><p>may use threats or pressure on the landlord to cause delays </p><p>or interference with services to the PD program.  The </p><p>landlord of the current American Center in Rangoon was jailed </p><p>before the Center opened in 1991.  And Mandalay authorities </p><p>used threats to hotel employees to disrupt a PD cultural </p><p>program in January 2003 (Rangoon 00134).  Post may even spend </p><p>funds on security upgrades only to find the landlord renege </p><p>on the contract because of pressure from authorities. </p><p> </p><p>--  Implicit in this option is post\'s disposal of the USG </p><p>property, i.e., sell it back to the despotic Burmese regime </p><p>for what was paid for it (now worth $75), leading to a huge </p><p>windfall for the Generals, and a public affairs embarrassment </p><p>for the Department. </p><p> </p><p>35.
