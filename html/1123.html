REASON: 1.5 (B) AND (D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C)  SUMMARY:  DOMESTIC ELECTION MONITORS HAVE EXPRESSED SERIOUS </p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION THAT UN ACCREDITATION OF </p><p>INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS WILL BE APPROVED BY AN INTER-MINISTERI </p><p>AL </p><p>GOVERNMENT BODY, RATHER THAN BY THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION </p><p>(ESC), AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST.  (THE SHIFT, RUMORED FOR WEEKS </p><p>, WAS </p><p>MADE OFFICIAL IN AMENDED ELECTION REGULATIONS GAZETTED JUNE 7.)  THE </p><p>DOMESTIC MONITORS, WHO VIEW THE ESC AS MORE INDEPENDENT, SEE THIS AS PA </p><p>RT OF </p><p>A BROADER EROSION OF THE ROLE OF THE ESC (TO WHICH THEY REPORT).  THEY </p><p>HAVE </p><p>SAID THAT THEY MAY REFUSE TO WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS IF T </p><p>HEY </p><p>ACCEPT ACCREDITATION THROUGH A GOVERNMENT BODY OTHER THAN THE ESC. </p><p>OBSERVER DELEGATIONS ARE WORKING HARD TO FIND A FORMULA TO PRESERVE THE </p><p>IR </p><p>RELATIONS WITH DOMESTIC OBSERVERS WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THEIR OWN EFFORT </p><p>S. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>DOMESTIC OBSERVERS\' CONCERNS </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.

IN THE PAST, THIS ROLE WAS PLAYED BY THE </p><p>ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION, WHICH THE NGO\'S VIEW AS MORE </p><p>INDEPENDENT.  THE PRIMARY SPOKESMAN FOR THE DOMESTIC OBSERVERS HAS BEEN </p><p> </p><p>ISAAC MAPOSA, COORDINATOR OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY (NCA) </p><p>, </p><p>WHICH IS A MEMBER ORGANIZATION IN THE ELECTION SUPPORT NETWORK, A </p><p>CONSORTIUM OF NGO\'S INVOLVED IN ELECTION MONITORING. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) AFTER WEEKS OF UNCERTAINTY OVER WHO WOULD APPROVE ACCREDITATION </p><p>OF INTERNATIONAL MONITORS, THE GOVERNMENT GAZETTED AMENDMENTS TO </p><p>ELECTORAL REGULATIONS ASSIGNING THIS TASK TO "THE ELECTION DIRECTORATE, </p><p> ON </p><p>THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS."  THE ROLE OF </p><p>ACCREDITING DOMESTIC MONITORS REMAINS WITH THE ESC.  AMONG THE OTHER </p><p>PROVISIONS OF THE AMENDED REGULATIONS ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- A PROHIBITION AGAINST MEMBERS OF POLITICAL PARTIES ACTING AS ELECTIO </p><p>N </p><p>MONITORS AT POLLS WHERE A MEMBER OF THEIR PARTY IS CONTESTING (NOTE: ZA </p><p>NU- </p><p>PF AND THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) ARE CONTESTING IN ALL </p><p>CONSTITUENCIES.  END NOTE.); </p><p> </p><p>-- A PROVISION ALLOWING THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL TO REQUIRE DOMESTIC MONIT </p><p>ORS </p><p>TO ATTEND A TRAINING COURSE; </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  03098  01 OF 02  090725Z </p><p>-- A USD 100 ACCREDITATION FEE FOR INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS. </p><p> </p><p>SINCE THERE IS NO SITTING PARLIAMENT, THE LEGISLATION ENTERS INTO EFFEC </p><p>T </p><p>IMMEDIATELY. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  THE DOMESTIC OBSERVERS HAVE TOLD THE UN AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>OBSERVERS THAT THEY VIEW THE TRANSFER OF ACCREDITATION APPROVAL TO THE </p><p>ELECTION DIRECTORATE AS ONE OF A NUMBER OF STEPS THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT </p><p> </p><p>HAS TAKEN TO SIDELINE THE ESC, TO WHICH THE DOMESTIC OBSERVERS REPORT, </p><p>AND </p><p>CENTRALIZE CONTROL OVER THE ELECTION PROCESS.  IN A JUNE 2 MEETING WITH </p><p> THE </p><p>EUROPEAN COMMISSION OBSERVER DELEGATION, REPRESENTATIVES OF HUMAN RIGHT </p><p>S </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER CIVIL SOCIETY NGO\'S ECHOED THESE CONCERNS. </p><p> </p><p>THE UN\'S STANCE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.
