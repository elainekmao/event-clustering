<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 000039 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>S/CT FOR REAP </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PTER, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 201772 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Post provides the following input for the 2002 Annual </p><p>Terrorism Report.  The information is keyed to the questions </p><p>asked in REFTEL: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A. (U) Civilian rule returned to Nigeria with the </p><p>inauguration </p><p>of Olusegun Obasanjo as President in May 1999.  Since his </p><p>inauguration, President Obasanjo has pursued an active </p><p>international agenda commensurate with Nigeria\'s perception </p><p>of </p><p>its role as a leader in both continental and world affairs. </p><p>As </p><p>such, Nigeria has established a balanced foreign policy that </p><p>coincides with USG interests in many important respects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U)   President Obasanjo\'s government was among the first to </p><p>send condolences after the September 11 attacks.  More </p><p>importantly, Nigeria  steadfastly and publicly lent its </p><p>diplomatic support to Coalition efforts against the Taliban </p><p>and </p><p>Al Queda despite the domestic political ramifications of </p><p>being </p><p>home to Africa\'s second largest Muslim population. The GON </p><p>backed UN Resolutions 1267, 1333 and 1368 and has initiated </p><p>legislative and regulatory steps to shore up its anti-money </p><p>laundering regime in order to fight terrorism. The New </p><p>Partnership for African Development (NePAD), an organization </p><p>founded by Obasanjo and other African Heads of State, has </p><p>condemned terrorism and called for concrete measures to be </p><p>taken </p><p>by African states to combat the scourge. Nigeria is signatory </p><p>to </p><p>three UN counter-terrorism conventions and is reviewing other </p><p>UN </p><p>conventions with the view of acceding to these instruments. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Nigeria also has taken on a leading role in making </p><p>counter- </p><p>terrorism an important issue in West Africa, the sub-region </p><p>where Nigeria\'s diplomatic and political influence is most </p><p>pronounced. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B. (U) Judiciary: There have been no known acts of terrorism </p><p>nor </p><p>criminal prosecutions of terrorists during the year. While </p><p>current criminal law does not contain many specific anti- </p><p>terrorism provisions, the penal code does proscribe acts of </p><p>violence, which includes terrorism. Because President </p><p>Obasanjo </p><p>has given terrorism a high priority, the GON is moving </p><p>quickly </p><p>to draft improved terrorism legislation.  Likewise, the </p><p>judiciary probably would prosecute diligently any cases of </p><p>terrorism and would cooperate with the USG in prosecution </p><p>despite some of the institutional shortcomings of the </p><p>judiciary, </p><p>i.e. understaffing, corruption, lack of equipment, large </p><p>caseloads and inadequate pay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>C. (U) Extradition: The GON did not extradite any suspected </p><p>terrorists or request extradition of any terrorists during </p><p>the </p><p>year. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. (U) Possible Impediments to Prosecution/ Extradition: </p><p>There </p><p>are no known legal impediments to prosecution or extradition </p><p>of </p><p>suspected terrorists.  However, members of both the police </p><p>force </p><p>and the judiciary have been susceptible to corruption in the </p><p>past. Given the high-level GON focus on counter-terrorism, it </p><p>would be difficult for corrupt practices to impede the </p><p>prosecution or extradition of any high-visibility terrorism </p><p>cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E. (U) Other Responses: The GON has enacted legislation, the </p><p>Anti-Terrorism, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Act, </p><p>containing explicit criminal sanctions against both terrorism </p><p>and terrorist financing.  Not only does the Act expressly </p><p>prohibit terrorism; it establishes an inter-agency commission </p><p>with the mandate to coordinate GON anti-terrorist activities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In view of Nigeria\'s importance as an oil exporter, the </p><p>establishment of the Niger Delta Security Commission (NDSC) </p><p>was </p><p>aimed to protect important American and other foreign </p><p>economic </p><p>interests in Nigeria.  The NDSC\'s mission is to enhance the </p><p>security of oil installations against possible terrorist </p><p>attacks. While the NSDC\'s mandate is laudable, the </p><p>effectiveness </p><p>of the Commission is uncertain. </p><p>(U) The Central Bank of Nigeria has been helpful in </p><p>circulating </p><p>lists of terrorist organizations.  The CBN has promised to </p><p>confiscate terrorist assets should they be discovered.  To </p><p>date, </p><p>no terrorist assets have been discovered.  Unfortunately, </p><p>institutions with responsibilities for fighting terrorist </p><p>financing are weak. In December, under pressure from the </p><p>Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the GON enacted several </p><p>new </p><p>laws to strengthen regulatory institutions.   Although the </p><p>threat of imminent FATF sanctions was necessary to push the </p><p>National Assembly into action, the legislation demonstrates </p><p>the </p><p>GON\'s commitment to fighting money laundering and other </p><p>financial crimes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>F.  (U) International Fora: The GON has given clear </p><p>diplomatic </p><p>support in the UN and within the Economic Community of West </p><p>African States to counter-terrorism. President Obasanjo also </p><p>worked to include anti-terrorism as a major aspect of the New </p><p>Partnership for African Development (NePAD). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>G. (U) The GON does not support international terrorism or </p><p>terrorists. The GON clearly and repeatedly has condemned </p><p>terrorism and followed up with concrete actions. However, </p><p>some </p><p>individuals and private groups in Nigeria have ties to and </p><p>perhaps receive funding from sources in Sudan, Iran, Pakistan </p><p>and Libya.  It is possible that some of these individuals or </p><p>groups may have indirect links with extremist or terrorist </p><p>organizations.  There has been one report of a Nigerian </p><p>national </p><p>fighting for the Taliban/Al-Qa\'ida in Afghanistan. The GON </p><p>does </p><p>not condone any such ties to terrorist groups. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>H. (U) Public Statements: The GON has made no public </p><p>statements </p><p>supporting terrorism or any terrorist group.  All GON </p><p>statements </p><p>have been against terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I. (U) Change in Posture: The GON has continued to be vocal </p><p>in </p><p>its opposition to terrorism. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>J. (U) Bilateral Cooperation: The Central Bank of Nigeria </p><p>(CBN) </p><p>responded quickly to USG requests to identify and freeze </p><p>terrorist assets if found in Nigeria.  The CBN issued a Call </p><p>Circular requiring all banks to identify any terrorist </p><p>entities </p><p>listed in Executive Order 13224.  The CBN has amended the </p><p>list </p><p>several times to reflect USG additions. Although no assets </p><p>have </p><p>been found to date, the CBN requires banks within its </p><p>jurisdiction to continuously monitor accounts.  The CBN also </p><p>has </p><p>implemented stricter customer identification procedures that </p><p>require banks to maintain sufficient information about </p><p>customers </p><p>and correspondent financial institutions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) By establishing the NDSC to protect oil installations </p><p>from </p><p>terrorist activity the GON is protecting U.S. economic and </p><p>commercial interests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) In general, the Nigerian Police and other security forces </p><p>have cooperated, within the limitations of their </p><p>capabilities, </p><p>in combating terrorism and in protecting American citizen </p><p>residents, USG personnel and USG installations. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>K. (U) The U.S. Government has not sought the cooperation of </p><p>the </p><p>GON in the investigation or prosecution of an act of </p><p>international terrorism in the past five years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>L. (U) Prevention of Terrorism: As stated in section J, GON </p><p>security agencies have cooperated in protecting U.S. citizens </p><p>and interests from possible acts of terrorism.  For example, </p><p>the </p><p>GON has provided enhanced and ongoing security for the </p><p>Embassy </p><p>and its related agencies and has given high priority to </p><p>information sharing for security purposes. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
