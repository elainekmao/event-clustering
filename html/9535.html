EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS AND PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The government has taken a number of important steps in </p><p>recent years to strengthen and better regulate the banking </p><p>system, whose weaknesses had contributed to macroeconomic </p><p>instability over the previous decade. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Parliament passed a law in June 1999 creating an independent </p><p>agency, the Banking and Regulation and Supervision Agency </p><p>(BRSA), to monitor and supervise Turkey\'s banks.  BRSA is </p><p>headed by a board whose seven members would be appointed by </p><p>the cabinet for six-year terms.  The law\'s provisions also </p><p>toughen conditions for establishing new banks or branches, </p><p>set credit limits to protect bank solvency, and strengthen </p><p>regulatory and sanctioning powers, including authorizing the </p><p>board to merge weak banks with stronger ones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The State Deposit Insurance Fund, under BRSA\'s management, </p><p>has taken over 21 undercapitalized or failing  banks, </p><p>including Imar Bankasi which was taken over on July 4, 2003. </p><p>It has recapitalized these banks, and has been selling or </p><p>liquidating them </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BRSA launched an auditing and recapitalization program in </p><p>early 2002 that resulted in increased transparency and </p><p>better accounting for non-performing loans  The BRSA also </p><p>has issued regulation limiting the extent of connected </p><p>lending (between a bank and related corporate entities) and </p><p>requiring frequent BRSA on-site monitoring. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>One of the most significant achievements of the reform </p><p>program has been to restructure the state banks, which </p><p>continue to control more than one-half of Turkish banking </p><p>assets.  The government liquidated one state bank (Emlak </p><p>Bank), is trying to privatize another (Vakif Bank), and has </p><p>significantly downsized (Ziraat Bankasi and Halkbank). </p><p>Also, it largely eliminated state bank duty losses - </p><p>unreimbursed subsidized loans from these banks - which had </p><p>created an enormous financial hole that helped bring about </p><p>the most recent financial crisis </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Because of high local borrowing costs (real interest rates </p><p>can exceed 25 percent), short repayment periods, and limited </p><p>liquidity condition during the current economic crisis, both </p><p>foreign and local investors frequently seek credit from </p><p>international markets to finance their activities.  As of </p><p>July 2003, there were 51 commercial banks (including 14 </p><p>foreign banks) and  14 development or investment banks </p><p>operating in Turkey.   Total sectoral assets were </p><p>approximately USD 130.1 billion, or about 75 percent of GNP, </p><p>as of July 2003 according to data from the Banking </p><p>Regulation and Supervision Board.  The three state-owned </p><p>commercial banks and the top six privately capitalized banks </p><p>hold approximately 69 percent of total assets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There is a regulatory system established to encourage and </p><p>facilitate portfolio investments, though it needs </p><p>improvements in transparency, accounting, and enforcement </p><p>provisions to bring it up to EU and US standards.  The </p><p>Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE), formed in 1986, is becoming </p><p>one of the major players among emerging markets.  As of end- </p><p>2001, 310 companies were listed on the exchange. However, </p><p>Turkey has yet to develop other capital markets.  The </p><p>Capital Markets Board is responsible for overseeing the </p><p>activities of capital markets, including activities of ISE- </p><p>quoted companies, and securities and investment houses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish private sector is dominated by a number of large </p><p>holding companies, whose upper management is controlled by </p><p>prominent families.  Most large businesses continue to float </p><p>publicly only a minority portion of company shares in order </p><p>to limit outside interference in company management. </p><p>Hostile takeovers are unknown in Turkey.  There has been no </p><p>attempt at a hostile takeover by either international or </p><p>domestic parties in recent memory. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are no laws or regulations that specifically authorize </p><p>private firms to adopt articles of incorporation or </p><p>association to limit or prohibit foreign investment, </p><p>participation, or control.  Neither is there any attempt by </p><p>the private sector or government to restrict foreign </p><p>participation in industry standard-setting consortia or </p><p>organizations. </p><p>10.  POLITICAL VIOLENCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The general security situation throughout Turkey is stable, </p><p>but sporadic incidents involving terrorist groups have </p><p>occurred.  The Turkish government is committed to </p><p>eliminating terrorist groups such as the Kurdistan Workers\' </p><p>Party (PKK - now renamed Kadek) and various other militant </p><p>groups. These groups have used terrorist activity to make </p><p>political statements, particularly in Istanbul and other </p><p>urban areas of Turkey.  In 2000 and 2001, terrorists </p><p>targeting Turkish officials and various civilian facilities, </p><p>such as fast food restaurants, in Istanbul were responsible </p><p>for the deaths and injuries of several dozen people.  In </p><p>2002 and 2003, civilian venues such as fast food restaurants </p><p>have been the targets of minor bomb attacks.  Operation </p><p>Iraqi Freedom triggered largely peaceful demonstrations in </p><p>most major Turkish cities, but a series of bombings also </p><p>occurred in several of Turkey\'s larger cities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although the Turkish government takes air safety seriously </p><p>and maintains strict controls, particularly on international </p><p>flights, hijacking attempts have occurred as recently as </p><p>2003.  In 2001, a flight attendant was killed during a </p><p>hijacking by Chechen terrorists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.  CORRUPTION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CORRUPTION IS PERCEIVED TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM IN </p><p>TURKEY BY PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. </p><p>THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED TWO SIGNIFICANT ANTI- </p><p>CORRUPTION OPERATIONS IN 2001, ONE IN THE ENERGY </p><p>MINISTRY AND THE OTHER IN THE PUBLIC WORKS MINISTRY. </p><p>SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WERE CHARGED WITH CORRUPTION AND </p><p>WRONGDOING IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACT TENDERS.  THE </p><p>OPERATIONS RESULTED IN THE RESIGNATION OF BOTH </p><p>MINISTERS AND THE ARREST OF MANY HIGH-LEVEL </p><p>OFFICIALS.  PARLIAMENT CONTINUES TO PROBE CORRUPTION </p><p>IN THE ENERGY MINISTRY AND OTHER GOVERNMENT BODIES. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Corruption is reputedly a serious  problem in public </p><p>procurement, with frequent allegations that contracts are </p><p>awarded on the basis of personal and political relationships </p><p>of businesspersons and government officials.  The judicial </p><p>system is also perceived to be susceptible to external </p><p>political and commercial influence to some degree. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkish legislation outlaws bribery and some prosecutions of </p><p>government officials for corruption have taken place, but </p><p>enforcement is uneven. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey ratified the OECD antibribery convention, and passed </p><p>implementing legislation in January 2003 to provide that </p><p>bribes of foreign officials, as well as domestic, are </p><p>illegal and not tax deductible.  Bribes cannot be deducted </p><p>from taxes as a business expense. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Turkish government became a party to three conventions </p><p>of the Council of Europe in 2001: the Strasbourg Convention </p><p>on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the </p><p>Proceeds from Crime; the Criminal Law on Corruption; and the </p><p>Civil Law on Corruption. By becoming a party to these </p><p>conventions, the Turkish government agreed to define </p><p>corruption as a predicate offense for money laundering and </p><p>to address private sector corruption, as well as public </p><p>sector corruption, as a crime.  The Turkish government has </p><p>signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized </p><p>Crime in 2001 and has submitted a draft proposal to become a </p><p>party to the UN Convention Against Corruption. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>U.S. firms have sometimes alleged that corruption, or at a </p><p>minimum nontransparent practices, have been a barrier to </p><p>direct foreign investment.  American companies operating in </p><p>Turkey have complained about contributions to the community </p><p>solicited, with varying degrees of pressure, by municipal or </p><p>local authorities. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Prime Ministry\'s Inspection Board, which advises a new </p><p>Corruption Investigations Committee, is responsible for </p><p>investigating major corruption cases.  Nearly every state </p><p>agency has its own inspector corps responsible for </p><p>investigating internal corruption.  The National Assembly </p><p>can establish investigative commissions to examine </p><p>corruption allegations concerning Cabinet Ministers for the </p><p>Prime Minister; a majority vote in the parliament is needed </p><p>to send these cases to the Supreme Court for further action. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Transparency International has an affiliated NGO in </p><p>Istanbul. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  BILATERAL INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since 1985, Turkey has been negotiating and signing </p><p>agreements for the reciprocal promotion and protection of </p><p>investments.  Turkey has signed or initiated negotiations on </p><p>bilateral investment treaties with 79 countries.  Forty- six </p><p>of these agreements are now in force, including with the </p><p>United States, United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, </p><p>Belgium Luxembourg, Denmark, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, </p><p>Spain, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Tunisia, Kuwait, </p><p>Bangladesh, China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Croatia, </p><p>Cuba, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Russian Federation, </p><p>Kazakhstan, Georgia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, </p><p>Belarus, Macedonia, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Moldova, </p><p>Kyrgyzstan, Albania, Bulgaria, Argentina, Bosnia, Malaysia, </p><p>Egypt, Mongolia, Greece and Israel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey\'s bilateral investment treaty with the United States </p><p>came into effect on May 18, 1990.  A bilateral tax treaty </p><p>between the two countries took effect on January 1, 1998. </p><p>Turkey has signed avoidance of double taxation agreements </p><p>with 59 countries; 39 of these are in force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13.  OPIC AND OTHER INVESTMENT INSURANCE PROGRAMS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) offers a </p><p>full range of programs in Turkey, including political risk </p><p>insurance for U.S. investors, under its bilateral agreement </p><p>with Turkey.  OPIC is also active in financing private </p><p>investment projects implemented by U.S. investors in Turkey. </p><p>OPIC-supported direct equity funds, including the USD 200 </p><p>million Soros Private Equity Fund can make direct equity </p><p>investments in private sector projects in Turkey.  Small- </p><p>and medium-sized U.S. investors in Turkey are also eligible </p><p>to utilize the new Small Business Center facility at OPIC, </p><p>offering OPIC finance and insurance support on an expedited </p><p>basis for loans from USD 100,000 to USD 10 million.  In </p><p>1987, Turkey became a member of the Multinational Investment </p><p>Guarantee Agency (MIGA). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The U.S. Government annually purchases approximately USD 19 </p><p>million of local currency.  Embassy purchases are made at </p><p>prevailing market rates, which fluctuate in accordance with </p><p>Turkey\'s free floating exchange rate regime. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pearson </p><p></p></div>
