<p>UNCLAS HO CHI MINH CITY 000491 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, VM, KIRF, ETMIN, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT: INVITATIONS TO "DISCUSS" RELIGION IN DAK LAK PROVINCE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU)  On May 29, ConGen Poloff and Pol/Econ assistant met </p><p>with a reliable contact regarding the situation of unregistered </p><p>religious minority groups in Dak Lak province.  The contact </p><p>gave ConGenoff a collection of written materials -- some </p><p>official-looking original documents and several photocopied </p><p>"invitations" from district and commune police offices in Dak </p><p>Lak.  There were also photocopies of "invitations" from a local </p><p>Fatherland Front Committee.  The invitations ask the </p><p>individuals to meet with officials to discuss GVN policy on </p><p>religious affairs.  According to our contact, however, during </p><p>these meetings each individual was asked to sign a document </p><p>saying s/he would disband the unrecognized church council to </p><p>which they belonged.  The documents originate in either Krong </p><p>No District or Truong Xuan Commune (Dak Song District).  Poloff </p><p>was unable to verify the authenticity of these documents but </p><p>has no reason to doubt the source\'s sincerity. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Post\'s contact indicated that the invitations were </p><p>given to individuals he personally knew in Dak Lak province. </p><p>He received the documents from the pastors to whose </p><p>congregations these individuals belong -- with the agreement to </p><p>protect the information and bring it to the USG and other </p><p>groups concerned about the treatment of unrecognized religious </p><p>minorities in the Central Highlands. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The invitations are dated between January 18 and May </p><p>2 and were addressed to the following people: </p><p> </p><p>Y\'Chroih </p><p>Y Chroih Bap Rok </p><p>Y Chroih Ma Roc (a.k.a. Y Chroih Ma Roh) </p><p>Y Tai "Ma Jay" (a.k.a. Y Tai Ma Jani) </p><p>Y Son </p><p>H\'Pleh (Ami Vol) </p><p>Y\'Hoan B\'Krong </p><p>Y Duc K Man </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) The invitations originating with the police in Krong </p><p>No District requested the individuals to meet with officers at </p><p>the police station to "work".  This verb is commonly taken to </p><p>mean that the invited person will have to discuss certain </p><p>subjects with the police. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) The invitations originating with the Chairman or </p><p>Vice-Chairman of the Fatherland Front Committee of Truong Xuan </p><p>Commune, Dak Song District, state the purpose of the meeting is </p><p>"to review Decision No. 26/ND-CP regarding religious affairs, </p><p>as per step 2 of the plan to disband the Protestant Church </p><p>Council", or "to discuss the religious situation". </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) According to Post\'s contact, the pastors of these </p><p>individuals reported that each time the individual arrived at </p><p>the required time and place, s/he would be lectured by the </p><p>official on the law relating to the recognition of churches in </p><p>Vietnam.  Then the individual would be asked to sign a paper </p><p>agreeing to disband the lay church council of the unrecognized </p><p>Protestant church to which s/he belonged.  If the individual </p><p>did not agree to sign, s/he had to stay in the office until </p><p>close of business.  Post\'s contact said that sometimes this </p><p>daily summons and "office detention" would continue for up to </p><p>two weeks. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) Comment: This is the first time Post has seen what </p><p>appears to be an  official paper request to disband a house </p><p>church council.  As far as we know, the GVN\'s official </p><p>recognition of the Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam </p><p>(SECV) did not stipulate a limit on the number of churches that </p><p>could be recognized within each district within a province.  In </p><p>previous discussions with the Ethnic Minority and Religious </p><p>Affairs Committees of Dak Lak and Gia Lai Provinces, committee </p><p>members never mentioned a limit on the number of churches, but </p><p>did say each "sub-association" seeking recognition as a church </p><p>should have a minimum of about 100 members.  However, Post\'s </p><p>contact has indicated that when his pastor friends discussed </p><p>applying for official GVN recognition through the SECV, they </p><p>were told by district officials there could only be one </p><p>recognized Protestant church -- of any denomination --  per </p><p>district.  Post\'s contact said that believers of all sects have </p><p>been told they must consolidate with the the single recognized </p><p>Protestant church in their district in order to be considered </p><p>legal.  (All house churches and their church councils remain </p><p>technically illegal.)  ConGenoffs will pursue this issue with </p><p>provincial officials and reliable contacts.  End comment. </p><p>YAMAUCHI </p><p></p></div>
