At the </p><p>beginning of his European tour Erdogan argued that the </p><p>Cyprus issue should be separated from Turkey\'s membership </p><p>issue.  However, in recent statements Erdogan has said that </p><p>Turkey will agree to discuss the UN Cyprus plan if the EU </p><p>sets a date for Turkey at the Copenhagen Summit.  "Radikal" </p><p>reports that Erdogan has denied allegations that he has </p><p>changed course, saying that he has not backed away from his </p><p>offer to tackle EU entry together with the Cyprus issue and </p><p>ESDP.  However, solving all of these problems at the same </p><p>time is not possible, according to Erdogan.  "Cumhuriyet" </p><p>criticizes Erdogan for making statements on behalf of Turkey </p><p>despite the fact that he has no official position in the </p><p>government.  "Hurriyet" reports that TRNC President Denktas </p><p>has prepared an alternative plan on Cyprus and conveyed his </p><p>proposal to Ankara.  After evaluating the plan, MFA will </p><p>send it to UN General Secretary Annan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Iraq: "Hurriyet" reports that the German Customs directorate </p><p>has arrested the leaders of a smuggling ring that was </p><p>importing 6 million bottles of Vodka and 2 million liters of </p><p>beer to Iraq through Mersin.  Citing the German magazine </p><p>`Focus,\' `Hurriyet\' reports that these bottles were </p><p>transported from Hamburg and Belgium to Saddam\'s palaces and </p><p>various Iraqi cities through the harbour at Mersin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Constitutional Debate in Parliament: All papers report that </p><p>during yesterday\'s parliamentary debate, discussions focused </p><p>mainly on constitutional reforms.  "Cumhuriyet" gives </p><p>extensive front-page coverage to warnings issued by Baykal </p><p>and DSP leader Ecevit.  During his speech in parliament, </p><p>Baykal said that he was deeply disappointed by AKP efforts </p><p>to amend the constitution and the failure to tackle the </p><p>issue of parliamentary immunity.  In response to Baykal\'s </p><p>criticism, PM Gul said that the government would seek </p><p>constitutional changes through compromise.  Gul also said </p><p>that AKP had no secret intention to change the regime. </p><p>ISAF: "Hurriyet" reports that ISAF commander General Zorlu </p><p>said that the US will give the promised $228 million in </p><p>assistance not in cash, but in military equipment.  Gen. </p><p>Zorlu added that Turkish troops\' six months duty in </p><p>Afghanistan will not have negative effects on the Turkish </p><p>economy.  Zorlu said that the duty in Afghanistan had given </p><p>a rich experience to Turkish troops. </p><p>Amb. Pearson visit to PM Gul:  "Cumhuriyet" reports that </p><p>American Ambassador W. Robert Pearson visited PM Gul </p><p>yesterday.  Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Amb. </p><p>Pearson confirmed what had been announced on all TV networks </p><p>yesterday, that Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz  and </p><p>Assistant Secretary of State Grossman will be coming to </p><p>Turkey next Tuesday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDITORIAL OPINION: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"In the case of war" </p><p>Fikret Ertan wrote in Islamic-intellectual Zaman (11/27): </p><p>"After the Gulf war the casualty figure for the US side was </p><p>reported to be 613.  The figure for Iraq, however, has never </p><p>been made public, and even 12 years later we still don\'t </p><p>have a clear and precise figure regarding Iraq\'s losses and </p><p>casualties.  Although Iraq never announced its casualty </p><p>count, most estimates are around 200,000. . Since the world </p><p>is on the eve of a second Gulf war, it really makes me sad </p><p>to think about the very likely additional casualties that </p><p>the Iraqi people will have to suffer. . According to a </p><p>report by British-based `Medact,\' Iraq will experience </p><p>colossal losses as a result of its devastated health system </p><p>after 12 years of UN sanctions.  In the event of a US strike </p><p>against Iraq, the picture will be much worse than in 1991. </p><p>It will involve not only the total destruction of Iraq, but </p><p>also will pose a serious risk to regional economies, </p><p>including Turkey\'s.  May God save the world from this war." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Denktas more flexible, and ESDP is solved" </p><p>Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in mass appeal-sensational Posta </p><p>(11/27): "Following his meeting with Turkish Foreign </p><p>Minister Yakis in New York, the Turkish Cypriot leader has </p><p>showed a more flexible approach.  Denktas has indicated that </p><p>he would give a positive reaction to the Annan package, just </p><p>as Clerides has done.  However, he still wants to announce </p><p>that he considers the package merely `negotiable\' rather </p><p>than announcing that it `constitutes a platform for </p><p>negotiations\'. The discussions are continuing. Denktas is </p><p>expected to give a reply by the end of the week.  There is </p><p>important progress on the ESDP/EU issue as well.  According </p><p>to EU officials, Turkish officials and Javier Solana have </p><p>reached an agreement. According to the formula, Cyprus and </p><p>Malta will be kept outside the ESDP mechanism. For now, the </p><p>agreement is being examined by Greece. If the Greeks go </p><p>along, the problem will be solved.  . We are about to </p><p>resolve the 28-year-old Cyprus problem, and are preparing to </p><p>take some very important steps toward EU membership. This </p><p>situation is playing havoc with the society\'s habits, vision </p><p>and capacity for perception.  Everything has been crammed </p><p>into the next few weeks. Whatever will happen, will happen. </p><p>Besides, these issues are interrelated. If the EU gives a </p><p>negotiation date, Turkey will display flexibility on Cyprus. </p><p>If Turkey displays flexibility on Cyprus, this will </p><p>encourage the EU to give a `date\'.  Currently, a tremendous </p><p>amount of bargaining is taking place. The parties concerned </p><p>are not willing to reveal the cards in their hands. They </p><p>make a point of concealing their real approach. Both the </p><p>Turkish side and EU officials are even providing misleading </p><p>information from time to time. Therefore, if I were you I </p><p>would not believe these statements at all. I would continue </p><p>to be skeptical until the evening of December 12." </p><p></p></div>
