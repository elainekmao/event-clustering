<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001429 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT PLEASE PASS TO FAA AND NTSB AND DOT </p><p>DOT FOR KEVIN SAMPLE AND B ALLEN </p><p>STATE ALSO FOR AF, AF/W, AF/PAS </p><p>NSC FOR AF DIRECTOR MICHAEL MILLER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/08/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EAIR, CASC, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AIR ACCIDENT KILLS OVER 100 IN KANO </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5(B) AND </p><p>(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) This report is being sent to give Washington the latest </p><p>information we have about the May 4 airplane crash in Kano. </p><p>According to our best information, all but two of the eighty </p><p>people aboard the plane died in the crash which occurred </p><p>shortly after the Lagos-bound EAS aircraft took off from </p><p>Kano\'s airport. The crash took place in a residential </p><p>neighborhood, and an estimated range of thirty to seventy </p><p>local residents were also killed.  Because of the lack of </p><p>forensic expertise and local records, ascertaining the exact </p><p>number of deaths will be difficult. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.(U) Among the victims are Minister of Sports I.M. Aku, </p><p>General N.T.H. Bozingha and the wife and son of influential </p><p>retired General Jerry Useni, former Minister for the Federal </p><p>Capital Territory under Sani Abacha. The brother of the </p><p>Embassy\'s FSN Political Assistant Mukhtari Shitu was also one </p><p>of the victims, therefore the tragedy of the crash struck </p><p>close to home for all Mission personnel, both Americans and </p><p>FSNs alike. There apparently were no AMCITS on board the </p><p>flight, though the possibility cannot yet be totally ruled </p><p>out.  The EAS passenger manifest, which lists victims and </p><p>survivors only by the first initial and surname, contains </p><p>possible hits on our American Citizen Services Warden </p><p>database.  We continue to check  to ensure none of these </p><p>victims were United States Citizens.  Two Frenchmen were </p><p>confirmed killed in the crash.  Bodies of victims who could </p><p>not be identified were buried in a mass grave in Kano on May </p><p>7. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) This crash highlights the precarious state of many of </p><p>Nigeria\'s domestic airlines. The use of old, poorly </p><p>maintained craft, heightens the danger of a fatal accident. </p><p>This crash has increased the already high degree of wariness </p><p>of the expatriate community about domestic air travel in </p><p>Nigeria. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.(U) The crash occurred approximately three minutes after </p><p>takeoff from Kano Airport at about 1:30 p.m., Saturday May 4. </p><p> The aircraft originated in Lagos, flew to Jos, made a stop </p><p>in Kano with a return flight to Lagos. The plane went down in </p><p>the residential area of Gwamaja, destroying many residences, </p><p>two schools, and reportedly two small neighborhood mosques. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) President Obasanjo cut short a trip to Southern Africa </p><p>to respond to the emergency.  He visited the site Monday </p><p>morning and then prayed with the Emir of Kano for the repose </p><p>of the souls of the dead.  He declared a two-day period of </p><p>national mourning and committed N10,000,000 ($870,000) in </p><p>relief assistance to the victims. (Comment: President </p><p>Obasanjo seems to have learned a public relations lesson </p><p>after the Ijeka Cantonment explosions in late January.  Then, </p><p>Obasanjo was accused of being callous and insensitive to </p><p>victims and their families after the explosions claimed over </p><p>1,000 lives.  This time, Obasanjo responded quickly to the </p><p>disaster, with both words of condolence and aid to the </p><p>victims. Several of his supporters, especially the Governor </p><p>of Bauchi State, urged him to do so. Although some still </p><p>complain that his visit to the crash site was too short, that </p><p>he neglected to meet with the victim\'s families, and that the </p><p>relief funds were too meager, Obasanjo\'s response showed </p><p>greater human and political sensitivities than he did four </p><p>months ago. End Comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U) Theories about the cause of the crash abound.  EAS is </p><p>reported by the media as notorious for its aged fleet, poor </p><p>maintenance record, and financial difficulties.  Although no </p><p>report specifically mentions the age of the crashed </p><p>BAC1-11-500 jet, there is speculation that the plane was </p><p>nearly thirty years old. Moreover, the Subcommittee Chairman </p><p>of the House of Representatives Committee on the Nigeria </p><p>Civil Aviation Authority, Ned Nwoko, has hinted of a law </p><p>already in the works which would make it compulsory for </p><p>aircraft older than 25 to be grounded.  The Ministry of </p><p>Aviation had proposed a ban on aircraft over 22 years, but at </p><p>the time of the accident it was being contested by the </p><p>Private Airline Association.  If this law were already on the </p><p>books the plane would have been offline and the tragedy </p><p>averted. (The modus operandi of many Nigerian airlines is to </p><p>purchase, at relatively low costs, aged planes deemed too old </p><p>and taken offline by carriers in other countries. Further </p><p>cost-cutting measures by some carriers include using </p><p>reconditioned rather than new parts when carrying out </p><p>repairs.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) EAS management publicly contend the aircraft was in </p><p>perfect mechanical order before the flight,  but other </p><p>reports claimed the same aircraft was involved in a near </p><p>accident only a week ago during the same flight.  The </p><p>National Chairman of the Alliance For Democracy political </p><p>party told PolCouns that he was told by a local official in </p><p>Kano that the  pilot who flew the plane from Jos to Kano </p><p>refused to fly the  aircraft to Lagos because of its </p><p>condition.  The AD chairman said that EAS had to find a </p><p>willing pilot at the last minute. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (U) There are reports that the crash was caused when a </p><p>wing fell off the plane; other reports claim that there was </p><p>an engine explosion. Still other reports blamed the runway, </p><p>claiming that the main runway is under repair and the one </p><p>used Saturday was too short. One "black box" has been found, </p><p>while the other is still missing. The government has grounded </p><p>all BAC1-11-500 aircraft in Nigeria and has promised a full </p><p>investigation. In a conversation with Ambassador, the </p><p>Minister of Aviation has asked for technical assistance to </p><p>help establish a program to investigate the crash as as well </p><p>as help it establish better criteria for purchasing and </p><p>maintaining commercial aircraft (septel). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) While the crash has shaken many people and caused them </p><p>to lament the state of the domestic airlines, some Nigerians </p><p>feel stung by the international media attention the crash has </p><p>generated.  During a May 7 meeting with the Ambassador, </p><p>Foreign Minister Lamido stated that CNN and BBC were overly </p><p>critical, making it appear that Nigerians and the GON were </p><p>totally irresponsible.  He remarked that airplane crashes </p><p>were inevitable in any country if enough flights were </p><p>attempted but CNN and the BBC were trying to make Nigerian </p><p>skies look especially dangerous.  Yet, almost in the same </p><p>breath, Lamido castigated the domestic air carriers and </p><p>admitted trepidation when flying on some domestic airlines. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) This air crash is the latest event in a string of </p><p>tragedies that have befallen Nigeria in the past eight </p><p>months.  Because of the nature of this particular tragedy </p><p>everyone has had to sheathe their political swords, if only </p><p>for the moment.  There will be collective mourning and the </p><p>grief will be genuine.  There will be calls for reform and </p><p>these calls will be sincere as well.  The Ambassador received </p><p>an urgent appeal from the Nigerian Minister of Aviation Kemi </p><p>Chikwe for assistance to investigate the crash and to help </p><p>Nigeria get a better handle on its domestic airlines </p><p>(septel).  We have long maintained that most domestic </p><p>commercial airlines in Nigeria are unsafe.  A thorough </p><p>investigation into aircraft procurement and maintenance </p><p>practices is long overdue. However, there is danger that this </p><p>somber moment will recede and that business as usual will </p><p>resume unless momentum to launch a serious investigation is </p><p>maintained.  Our positive response to the Aviation Minister\'s </p><p>reuest could help sustain that moment.  It would be a compund </p><p>tragedy if this crash crash does not compel greater airline </p><p>safety. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
