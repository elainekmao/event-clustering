<p>UNCLAS RANGOON 001211 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREF, PREL, BM, BG, IN, UNHCR, Human Rights, Ethnics </p><p>SUBJECT: ROHINGYA REFUGEE UPDATE </p><p> </p><p>1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Government of Burma has unofficially </p><p>told UNHCR that it would accept 5,000 of the remaining </p><p>22,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.  That would leave a </p><p>residual 17,000 people in Bangladesh to be locally settled </p><p>or otherwise accommodated.  UNHCR Rohingya repatriation </p><p>assistance will cease as of June 30, 2003.  40,000 potential </p><p>asylum seekers from Burma\'s Chin state are presently in </p><p>India\'s Mizoram state.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) Hitoshi Mise, the UNHCR\'s deputy director for the </p><p>EAP region, briefed the diplomatic corps in Rangoon June 18 </p><p>on his discussions with the GOB about Rohingya refugees. </p><p>Mise said he found the Deputy Minister of Immigration </p><p>"unusually flexible" and secured GOB agreement on three </p><p>logistical issues regarding Rohingya refugee repatriation. </p><p>The Deputy Minister, speaking off the record, told UNHCR </p><p>that the GOB would consider accepting up to 5,000 of the </p><p>22,000 refugees still in Bangladesh. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) Mise noted that this would leave some 17,000 </p><p>Rohingyas in Bangladesh.  He said UNHCR might have to re- </p><p>verify their refugee status, as many of the individuals left </p><p>Burma in 1991 or 1992.  Local settlement in Bangladesh might </p><p>be a likely prospect for the residual 17,000, Mise mused </p><p>aloud, while noting he planned to travel to Dhaka shortly to </p><p>discuss these issues with the Government of Bangladesh. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) The governments of Burma and Bangladesh have agreed </p><p>that UNHCR repatriation assistance to Rohingya refugees </p><p>would cease on June 30, 2003, Mise reported.  UNHCR reps </p><p>added that the resettlement assistance programs for the </p><p>232,000 returned Rohingya refugees would continue beyond </p><p>that date. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) UNHCR representatives at the briefing reported </p><p>that some 40,000 dislocated people from Chin state are </p><p>currently in Mizoram.  As the UNHCR has no presence in </p><p>Mizoram (individuals seeking refugee status must apply in </p><p>New Delhi) and with the Mizo/Zomi ethnic group straddling </p><p>the India - Burma border, Mise said it is very difficult for </p><p>these folks to establish refugee status.  Resident UNHCR </p><p>head Rajiv Kapur commented that the numbers of Burmese </p><p>applying for refugee status in New Delhi are small but </p><p>growing (about 700 over the last three months).  He also </p><p>commented that the official residence of Indian Defense </p><p>Minister George Fernandes is currently being used to house </p><p>large numbers of displaced Burmese. </p><p></p></div>
