<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 001701 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 3/20/2003 </p><p>TAGS: AEMR, AMGT, CASC, CVIS, IZ, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: TF1ZO1: AMMAN SITREP 3 (3/20 2000 LOCAL) </p><p> </p><p>REF: FBIS GMP20030320000185 </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY:AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM. REASONS 1.5(B,D) </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>General Overview </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) As of 2000 local time (1800 GMT) the situation in </p><p>Jordan remains calm.  A steady rain throughout the day has </p><p>kept many people off the streets.  A   demonstration not </p><p>sanctioned by the GOJ (numbering in the low hundreds) has </p><p>begun at the Professional Associations Complex in the </p><p>Shmeisani area of Amman and is continuing at this time. </p><p>According to an Embassy contact and a media report (which the </p><p>PSD has not confirmed), there were some scuffles between the </p><p>protesters and GOJ security during the course of the protest. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  The Director of the GOJ\'s Karameh crossing with Iraq </p><p>told the official Petra News Service that the flow of </p><p>travelers from Iraq has been "within normal rates," and </p><p>totaled about 4,200 for the day, mostly Jordanians and </p><p>individuals from other Arab countries (ref).  UNHCR reports </p><p>that as of 1600 (local), 350 third country nationals (TCNs) </p><p>had crossed into Jordan from Iraq.  The MFA believes a </p><p>Jordanian taxi driver, Ahmad Walid Ragheb, was killed in </p><p>Western Iraq.  Oil tanker truck traffic appears to be slowing </p><p>significantly.  During a 2 1/2 hour period 3/20, a DATT </p><p>officer sighted only 21 trucks crossing the border, 1/3 to </p><p>1/2 of the rate on a normal day.  The GOJ has set up </p><p>approximately 15 checkpoints on the road from Azraq to the </p><p>border, and declared the Eastern Zone within the Ruweished </p><p>District a closed  zone.  No access into the region will be </p><p>allowed without a permit from the Crisis Management Center of </p><p>the Interior Ministry. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Consular Issues </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) As of 2000, we have not received any reports of Amcits </p><p>crossing into Jordan from Iraq.  GOJ border officials have </p><p>told UNHCR officials at the border that Amcits with proper </p><p>identification would be allowed to travel directly to Amman. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>GOJ Actions/Statements </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) King Abdullah chaired a meeting of the State Security </p><p>Council at the General Intelligence Directorate (GID) </p><p>Headquarters during the afternoon.  According to the official </p><p>Petra News Service, the King told the council "what worries </p><p>us most is the suffering of the Iraqis and the catastrophic </p><p>situation they are passing through . . . we will not spare </p><p>any effort to shoulder our humanitarian duties towards the </p><p>Iraqi people with a view to ease their suffering and overcome </p><p>the effects of war."  PM Abul Ragheb affirmed that the GOJ </p><p>will enforce the law and will not allow anyone to violate it. </p><p> </p><p>-------- </p><p>Security </p><p>-------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C)  Cooperation with all GOJ security agencies continues </p><p>to be excellent.  Additional security measures around the </p><p>Embassy remain in place. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Refugee/Humanitarian Issues </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) UNHCR Senior Logistics Officer Douglas Osmond reports </p><p>that 350 TCNs (mostly Sudanese and a few Egyptians) have been </p><p>screened, identified, placed on buses with police escorts and </p><p>taken directly to the IOM/JRCS transit camp in Ruweished.  No </p><p>Iraqi asylum seekers have thus far sought to enter Jordan. </p><p>Of the 34 TCNS (again mostly Sudanese) that were detained at </p><p>the border during the course of the day due to inadequate </p><p>documentation, 15 were later cleared for entry into Jordan </p><p>(to the Ruweished TCN transit camp) and 19 are still under </p><p>review.  UNHCR has set up three tents at the border for these </p><p>individuals and IOM is providing them with food and water. </p><p>UNHCR also reports that approximately 100 meters beyond the </p><p>last GOJ border post (and still within no-man\'s land), the </p><p>GOJ has leveled off an area that could be used for a </p><p>campsite.  The JRCS has erected 10 tents there and is putting </p><p>in latrines and a water supply.  As of this report, UNHCR did </p><p>not know the purpose for this new campsite.  UNHCR has been </p><p>very satisfied with its degree of access at the border. </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Press </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) IO attended opening of UK government\'s press </p><p>information center at an Amman hotel.  FCO briefer and UK </p><p>Ambassador provided official statements and some background </p><p>commentary to assembled international press.  Separately, the </p><p>UN opened a briefing press briefing center, which intends </p><p>daily briefings for international press on regional UN </p><p>activities.  The majority of international press (including </p><p>representatives of all major US TV and print media) resident </p><p>in Jordan have relocated from Amman to Ruweished near the </p><p>Iraqi border.  The GOJ has allowed journalists to operate </p><p>there and to cover humanitarian and refugee issues at the </p><p>Iraq/Jordan border.  The interest of the great majority of </p><p>these journalists remains, however, gaining access to Iraq at </p><p>such a time that it becomes safe to do so. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
