(C) IN A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR ON AUGUST 16, </p><p>NEW HOME AFFARIS MINISTER -- AND ZANU-PF CHAIRMAN -- JOHN </p><p>NKOMO PROVIDED A CONFUSING AND SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY </p><p>ACCOUNT OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S NEXT STEPS ON LAND REFORM. </p><p>HIS COMMENTS CONFIRMED THE CLEAR ABSENCE OF ANY </p><p>SYSTEMATIC RESETTLEMENT PLAN.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT OLD </p><p>GUARD MEMBERS LIKE NKOMO ARE CONTINUING TO FIGHT THE </p><p>GUERRILLA STRUGGLE AGAINST WHITES THROUGH LAND REFORM. </p><p>ACCORDING TO NKOMO, ALL 3,000 FARMS IDENTIFIED FOR </p><p>SEIZURE WOULD BE GAZETTED BY AUGUST 18 (ALTHOUGH WE WERE </p><p>INFORMED SUBSEQUENTLY BY THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION </p><p>THAT THIS DID NOT OCCUR), BUT THERE MIGHT BE A NEED FOR </p><p>ADDITIONAL LAND IN THE FUTURE.  OWNERS OF FARMS WILL HAVE </p><p>30 DAYS TO APPEAL AND, IF SUCCESSFUL, WILL BE TAKEN OFF </p><p>THE LIST.  NKOMO AGREES THAT PRODUCTIVE FARMS SHOULD BE </p><p>REMOVED.  OTHER FARMS WOULD THEN HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) NKOMO DENIED THE EXISTENCE OF SIGNIFICANT </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04627  01 OF 03  211754Z </p><p>LAWLESSNESS ON COMMERCIAL FARMS, AND REITERATED THAT THE </p><p>WAR VETERANS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN WHERE THEY ARE </p><p>PROVIDED THEY DO NOT ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE ACKOWLEDGED THAT FARM OCCUPATIONS WERE </p><p>CAUSING ECONOMIC DAMAGE, NKOMO INSISTED THAT SOME </p><p>DISRUPTIONS MAY BE NECESSARY TO CORRECT THE INJUSTICE OF </p><p>CURRENT LAND OWNERSHIP.  NKOMO CALLED THE NEW PARLIAMENT </p><p>"AMATEURS" AND DENIED THE EXISTENCE OF FACTIONS WITHIN </p><p>CABINET.  THE EMBASSY HAD A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>NKOMO WHEN HE WAS MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND </p><p>HOUSING, AND WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A POSITIVE DIALOGUE </p><p>WITH HIM IN HIS NEW PORTFOLIO.  WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY </p><p>DEPARTURES FROM THE GOVERNMENT\'S DISASTROUS POLICIES, </p><p>INCLUDING ON LAND, AND LIKELY WILL SEE MORE OF THE SAME </p><p>IN RURAL AREAS.    END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) THE AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFFS, CALLED </p><p>AUGUST 16 ON NEW HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER, AND ZANU-PF </p><p>CHAIRMAN, JOHN NKOMO.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE HAD ENJOYED </p><p>WORKING WITH NKOMO IN HIS PREVIOUS POSITION AS LOCAL </p><p>GOVERNMENT AND HOUSING MINISTER, AND HE LOOKED FORWARD TO </p><p>CONTINUING A PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AT HOME </p><p>AFFAIRS. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>CONFUSING NEXT STEPS ON LAND </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04627  01 OF 03  211754Z </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSED SERIOUS CONCERN THAT THE </p><p>VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION ON COMMERCIAL FARMS HAD </p><p>CONTINUED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE JUNE ELECTIONS, AND </p><p>ASKED WHAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDED TO DO ABOUT IT. NKOMO </p><p>BEGAN BY CLAIMING THAT THE 3,000 FARM FIGURE WAS </p><p>CONSISTENT WITH THE AMOUNT OF LAND TO BE TRANSFERRED AS </p><p>AGREED AT THE SEPTEMBER 1998 DONORS CONFERENCE.  804 </p><p>FARMS, HE SAID, HAD ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR </p><p>RESETTLEMENT, AND THE REMAINING APPROXIMATELY 2200 WOULD </p><p>BE GAZETTED ON AUGUST 18.  (NOTE: WE WERE SUBSEQUENTLY </p><p>INFORMED BY THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION ON AUGUST 21 </p><p>THAT NO FARMS WERE GAZETTED ON AUGUST 18.  229 FARMS WERE </p><p>IDENTIFIED FOR SEIZURE IN THE GOVERNMENT-INFLUENCED </p><p>NEWSPAPER "THE HERALD," BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN LISTED IN </p><p>THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT GAZETTE.  END NOTE.)  NKOMO </p><p>CLAIMED THAT ALL OWNERS HAVE 30 DAYS TO APPEAL; </p><p>PRODUCTIVE FARMS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE LIST.  ASKED </p><p>WHETHER NEW FARMS WOULD THEN HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED, NKOMO </p><p>SAID YES, BUT A NEW PROCESS WOULD BE REQUIRED.  HE ADDED </p><p>CRYPTICALLY THAT THE GOVERNMENT LIKELY WOULD ALLOW SOME </p><p>FARMERS TO STAY ON THEIR FARMS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, BUT </p><p>WOULD TELL THEM THAT THEIR LAND WOULD BE ACQUIRED AT SOME </p><p>POINT IN THE FUTURE.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT SUCH AN </p><p>ILLEGAL, UNCLEAR AND INCONSISTENT APPROACH CREATED </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ANXIETY AMONG FARMERS AND WREAKED HAVOC ON </p><p>THE ECONOMY. </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ8623 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  04627  02 OF 03  211219Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   ACQ-00   CEA-01   CIAE-00 </p><p>      SMEC-00  COME-00  CTME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOEE-00  DOTE-00 </p><p>      SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00    EUR-00   EXIM-01  E-00     FAAE-00 </p><p>      FBIE-00  VC-00    FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      ITC-01   LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00  OIC-02 </p><p>      OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00   P-00 </p><p>      SP-00    SSO-00   SS-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  T-00     USIE-00 </p><p>      PMB-00   DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /013W </p><p>                  ------------------7BF9DC  211220Z /38 </p><p>P 211217Z AUG 00 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 6882 </p><p>INFO SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY LONDON </p><p>AMEMBASSY PARIS </p><p>NSC WASHDC </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 004627 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF, AF/S, AF/EPS, EB/IFD/ODF, EB/TPP/ODC </p><p>TREASURY FOR ED BARBER, GRACE SONE, AND HOFFMAN BARAK </p><p>USDOC FOR 2037/ERIC HENDERSON </p><p>STATE PASS USTR/RWHITTAKER </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR GAYLE SMITH </p><p>LONDON FOR CHARLES GURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BISA WILLIAMS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  04627  02 OF 03  211219Z </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/17/05 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ECON, EFIN, EAGR, PINR, PHUM, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: NEW HOME AFFAIRS MINISTER IS STILL FIGHTING </p><p>GUERRILLA STRUGGLE THROUGH LAND REFORM </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED ABOUT THE PROPOSAL OF THE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) TO SELL FARMS IN PHASES </p><p>OVER SEVERAL YEARS.  NKOMO REPLIED THAT HE WAS IN DAILY </p><p>CONTACT WITH THE CFU, WHICH HAD OFFERED TO RELINQUISH 200 </p><p>FARMS NOW, AND OTHER FARMS IN BETWEEN PLANTING SEASONS. </p><p>HE PROVIDED NO ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THE CFU PROPOSAL, </p><p>WHICH HE SAID HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE MINISTERIAL GROUP </p><p>OVERSEEING THE FAST-TRACK RESETTLEMENT EFFORT. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>VIOLENCE?  WHAT VIOLENCE? </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) NOTING THAT THE EMBASSY IS RECEIVING MANY REPORTS </p><p>OF CONTINUING FARM VIOLENCE, THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHEN </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE PLANNED TO ORDER THE WAR VETERANS OFF </p><p>THE FARMS.  THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT, NKOMO REPLIED.  HE </p><p>HIMSELF WAS DEALING WITH THE VETERANS.  IN FACT, HE HAD </p><p>MET WITH THEM IN HIS OFFICE ON AUGUST 13.  SO LONG AS </p><p>THEY ARE NOT ENGAGING IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, THEY WILL BE </p><p>PERMITTED TO REMAIN ON THE FARMS.  HE DISAGREED THAT </p><p>THERE WAS WIDESPREAD LAWLESSNESS, INSISTING THAT </p><p>"MALICIOUS PEOPLE" WERE THE SOURCE OF SUCH REPORTS.  HE </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED ONLY THE EXISTENCE OF "CRIMINAL ELEMENTS" </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04627  02 OF 03  211219Z </p><p>WHO HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION, BUT INSISTED </p><p>THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED WHEN IDENTIFIED.  THE WAR VETERANS </p><p>HAD BEEN TOLD TO BE PREPARED TO MOVE TO LAND IDENTIFIED </p><p>FOR THEM AS SOON AS THEY RECEIVED THE WORD, BUT NKOMO </p><p>COULD NOT SAY WHEN THAT WOULD HAPPEN.  NKOMO THOUGHT THE </p><p>QUESTION OF LAWLESSNESS AND CRIMINAL ACTIVITY HAD BEEN </p><p>ADDRESSED ADEQUATELY.  THE GOVERNMENT WAS CERTAINLY </p><p>TRYING ITS BEST. </p><p> </p><p>7.  THE AMBASSADOR STRONGLY DISAGREED THAT THE PROBLEM </p><p>HAD BEEN RESOLVED.  HE SAID THAT THE VIOLENCE AND </p><p>INTIMIDATION WERE WRONG AND MUST BE STOPPED BY THE GOZ. </p><p>HE HAD TRAVELLED PERSONALLY TO AREAS AFFECTED BY LAND- </p><p>RELATED VIOLENCE, AND REPORTS OF VIOLENCE FROM RELIABLE </p><p>SOURCES WERE CONTINUING.  THE AMBASSADOR AND OTHERS HAVE </p><p>THAT PERCEPTION, NKOMO SAID, BECAUSE THEY HEAR FROM </p><p>PEOPLE LIKE CFU OFFICIAL DAVID HASLUCK, WHOSE NEGATIVE </p><p>RHETORIC MADE THE SITUATION WORSE.  TURNING EMOTIONAL, </p><p>NKOMO SAID ANGRILY THAT HE HAD FOUGHT IN THE INDEPENDENCE </p><p>WAR AND SUSTAINED INJURIES IN ORDER TO GET THE VOTE, AND </p><p>HAD LOST EVERYTHING IN THE PROCESS.  THE FARMERS WERE THE </p><p>ONES HE HAD FOUGHT AGAINST AND WHO HAD LOCKED HIM UP </p><p>DURING THE COLONIAL DAYS.  HIS FATHER HAD BEEN FORCED OFF </p><p>HIS LAND BY WHITES EARLY LAST CENTURY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>DISRUPTIONS NECESSARY TO CORRECT INJUSTICE </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) WAS NKOMO CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE </p><p>CAUSED BY THE LAWLESSNESS?  YES, HE REPLIED, BUT IT WAS </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  04627  02 OF 03  211219Z </p><p>ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE IT WAS IMPORTANT TO CORRECT A GLARING </p><p>INJUSTICE.  WHEN A WHITE FARMER HAS 20,000 HECTARES OF </p><p>LAND ACROSS A FENCE FROM BLACK ZIMBABWEANS HUDDLED IN </p><p>CONGESTED POVERTY, "THE SITUATION MUST BE PUT RIGHT," </p><p>NKOMO SAID.  IT IS ONLY HUMANE TO ADDRESS THIS </p><p>DISCREPANCY, AND SOME DISRUPTIONS MAY BE UNAVOIDABLE </p><p>ALONG THE WAY.  THE MINISTER WAS INCREDULOUS AT THE NERVE </p><p>OF IAN SMITH, WHO HE SAID CALLS HIM EVERY DAY ABOUT THE </p><p>STATUS OF HIS FARM.  HE CRITICIZED WHITE FARMERS FOR </p><p>BEING TOO HARDLINE AND REFUSING TO ACCEPT ANY OF THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT\'S PROPOSALS.  EVINCING SIGNIFICANT DISLIKE FOR </p><p>CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE WHITE COMMUNITY, NKOMO INSISTED </p><p>THAT ONE COULD NOT "TEACH OLD DOGS NEW TRICKS."  THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS HAD DRAGGED </p><p>THEIR FEET OVER THE YEARS, BUT THE GOVERNMENT ALSO HAD </p><p>ITS HARDLINERS.  NKOMO REPLIED THAT PERHAPS IT IS AN </p><p>ADVANTAGE TO HAVE THEM, AS THEY REMIND THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>THE NATURE OF THE "OTHER SIDE."  HE URGED THE UNITED </p><p>STATES TO LET ZIMBABWE RESOLVE THIS ISSUE ON ITS OWN. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>9.

THE ZDA IS EVIDENCE OF </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN ABOUT THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE, </p><p>AND THE EMBASSY SHARES THAT CONCERN.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS COULD DISCUSS </p><p>OUR DIFFERENCES CONSTRUCTIVELY.  NKOMO TERMED THE ZDA </p><p>"UNFORTUNATE," BUT AGREED WITH THE AMBASSADOR\'S POINT. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>PARLIAMENT AND CABINET </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) NKOMO DESCRIBED PARLIAMENT AS A "BUNCH OF </p><p>AMATEURS."  THAT WAS THE CASE ON BOTH SIDES, BUT HE ADDED </p><p>THAT HE AND OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS HAD ALL BEGUN THEIR </p><p>POLITICAL CAREERS AT THE SAME STAGE.  HE CRITICIZED THE </p><p>NEW MPS FOR FOCUSING THEIR EFFORTS ON PERSONAL ATTACKS </p><p>RATHER THAN ISSUES.  NKOMO DENIED THAT THE CABINET HAD </p><p>SPLIT INTO FACTIONS, CLAIMING THAT CABINET MEMBERS WERE </p><p>UNITED IN THEIR DESIRE TO GET ZIMBABWE BACK ON THE RIGHT </p><p>TRACK. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  04627  03 OF 03  211220Z </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>11.  (C) THE EMBASSY HAD A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH </p><p>NKOMO WHEN HE WAS MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AND WE </p><p>INTEND TO MAINTAIN A POSITIVE DIALOGUE WITH HIM.

WE SHOULD </p><p>NOT EXPECT ANY DEPARTURES FROM THE GOVERNMENT\'S RECENT </p><p>MISGUIDED POLICIES, HOWEVER.  NKOMO IS A ZANU-PF STALWART </p><p>WHO TOES THE PARTY LINE ON LAND REFORM AND OTHER KEY </p><p>ISSUES.  HIS CONFUSING, SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY COMMENTS </p><p>ON LAND CONFIRMED THE CLEAR ABSENCE OF ANY SYSTEMATIC </p><p>RESETTLEMENT PLAN.  JUDGING FROM NKOMO\'S COMMENTS, THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HAS NO INTENTION OF MOVING THE WAR VETERANS </p><p>OFF THE FARMS IN THE NEAR TERM NOR OF SERIOUSLY </p><p>ADDRESSING THE HAVOC THEY ARE WREAKING IN RURAL AREAS AND </p><p>IN UNDERMINING THE ECONOMY.  NKOMO\'S ATTITUDE ON LAND </p><p>REFORM IS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY LINGERING </p><p>RESENTMENT AGAINST THE WHITE FARMERS AS WELL AS, WE </p><p>BELIEVE, THE CALCULATION THAT THIS IS A WINNING POLITICAL </p><p>ISSUE FOR ZANU-PF. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
