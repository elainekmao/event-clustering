(SBU) Summary:  The Ambassador told Labor Minister Victor </p><p>Moreira during a courtesy call March 3 that there is </p><p>heightened USG interest in labor rights in Guatemala in the </p><p>context of CAFTA negotiations, and urged Moreira to address </p><p>cases in outstanding GSP petitions.  Moreira said that his </p><p>priorities include steps to prevent similar cases of labor </p><p>rights violations from arising in future, but that more </p><p>ambitious reforms will not be possible in an election year. </p><p>Investigating violence against union leaders, reforming the </p><p>labor justice system, and reinstating illegally fired workers </p><p>are not directly under the labor ministry\'s jurisdiction. </p><p>Nevertheless, at President Portillo\'s insistence, Moreira </p><p>said he would use the urgency of CAFTA negotiations to spur </p><p>what progress he could.  In a separate meeting, labor union </p><p>leaders urged the Ambassador to include strong labor </p><p>protections in CAFTA.  We will continue to press for GOG </p><p>measures that respond to GSP conditions and report on </p><p>progress before April 15.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>Our Labor Rights Agenda </p><p>----------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU) The Ambassador told Moreira that the GSP review </p><p>decision is pending, and there is heightened interest in the </p><p>petition in the context of CAFTA negotiations.  USG concerns </p><p>include: 1) the urgent need for more effective investigation </p><p>of violence against unionists, especially cases of killings </p><p>of labor leaders, to end the climate of impunity for </p><p>anti-union violence; 2) the need to streamline and strengthen </p><p>the labor justice system; and 3) the need for better </p><p>enforcement of labor court rulings.  Should Guatemala be put </p><p>under review, the Ambassador said, Guatemala\'s labor rights </p><p>protections will come under intense scrutiny by U.S. </p><p>officials; loss of GSP privileges would affect prospects for </p><p>a successful CAFTA negotiation. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) The Ambassador acknowledged that some of these </p><p>issues fall outside the jurisdiction of the labor ministry, </p><p>and mentioned his own efforts to enlist the cooperation of </p><p>other GOG leaders on labor rights, including President </p><p>Portillo (Ref b), the Attorney General (Refs a & d) the </p><p>President of the Supreme Court (Ref c), and the Economy </p><p>Minister (Ref e).  The Ambassador also raised with Morales </p><p>the case of workers at Finca Maria Lourdes, which is </p><p>highlighted in the AFL-CIO GSP petition.  This case involves </p><p>a coffee plantation in Quetzaltenango department where 55 </p><p>workers were illegally fired in 1995 after organizing a </p><p>union.  The labor courts ruled in favor of the workers and </p><p>ordered reinstatement of the workers.  Finca owners have </p><p>repeatedly refused entry to police attempting to serve the </p><p>court order.  LabAtt expressed appreciation for the efforts </p><p>by Moreira\'s predecessors to resolve difficult cases, and </p><p>urged that he consider doing so in this case. </p><p> </p><p>Moreira\'s Priorities </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) Moreira said that he intended to use the attention </p><p>to labor rights in the CAFTA talks to justify his own planned </p><p>initiatives to meet ILO standards, as follows: </p><p> </p><p>--  Resolve the teachers strike.  (Note: The GOG made the </p><p>teachers an offer on February 28 and teachers have rejected </p><p>the offer but will meet with GOG negotiators (Moreira, the </p><p>Education and Finance Ministers) under the facilitation of </p><p>Archbishop Quezada Toruno on March 4.  End Note.) Moreira </p><p>said that his predecessor, ex-minister Victor Hugo Godoy, was </p><p>dismissed at the Vice President\'s request over collusion </p><p>between ministry workers and the leaders of the teachers\' </p><p>strike. </p><p> </p><p>--  Legislation:  Introduce new child labor protections; </p><p>unprecedented sexual harassment legislation; a universal </p><p>"no-fault" severance system (which would help unclog the </p><p>labor courts, where workers unjustly fired must petition for </p><p>severance);" and reforms to permit social security coverage </p><p>for domestic workers (paid for by workers, not employers); </p><p> </p><p>--  Labor Justice:  Moreira said that President Portillo had </p><p>just called and asked him to emphasize the need for all three </p><p>branches of government to cooperate to address labor rights </p><p>issues.  Moreira is seeking a meeting with the Supreme Court </p><p>president to discuss the need for labor justice streamlining </p><p>(which will require legislation) and cooperation on specific </p><p>cases cited by the GSP petitions (e.g. Finca Maria Lourdes); </p><p> </p><p>--  Minimum Wage-Setting Process:  Review the current system </p><p>for fixing the minimum wage, which has been criticized by the </p><p>private sector as being unilateral on the part of the </p><p>Executive; </p><p> </p><p>--  Internal Reforms:  He has named a third vice minister, </p><p>for administrative affairs, and plans new internal </p><p>regulations.  Also hopes to achieve a collective bargaining </p><p>agreement with ministry workers.  He wants to develop a 3-5 </p><p>year plan which includes budgetary needs to address the needs </p><p>of the informal sector, CAFTA and longer-term necessary </p><p>reforms to the labor code; </p><p> </p><p>--  Civil Service Reform:  Analyze the problems of multiple </p><p>government personnel systems, and recommend reforms for the </p><p>next government to consider; </p><p>--  Public Employee Recreation Fund:  He hopes to spin this </p><p>off to an autonomous institute; and, </p><p> </p><p>--  Union Registration:  He will offer an amnesty for fines </p><p>during a six-month transition period. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU) Moreira agreed that the Finca Maria Lourdes case, </p><p>like the DYMEL case resolved in 2002, is emblematic of </p><p>egregious non-enforcement of court decisions.  Responsibility </p><p>for addressing these cases lies in the jurisdiction of the </p><p>courts.  He will discuss the case with the president of the </p><p>Supreme Court.  Moreira said his goal as Labor Minister is to </p><p>make key reforms to prevent similar cases from arising in the </p><p>future.  Vice Minister Antonio Monzon told the Ambassador </p><p>that there had been an agreement between local authorities, </p><p>fired Maria Lourdes workers and the plantation owner for </p><p>talks about how to resolve the situation, in which the labor </p><p>ministry is participating. </p><p> </p><p>Biographic Information and Comment </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Moreira is a former labor leader (Secretary General </p><p>of the state electricity utility union, STINDE, in the </p><p>mid-90\'s) who was named on January 30 to replace ex-minister </p><p>Victor Hugo Godoy, now rumored to be named Guatemala\'s next </p><p>Ambassador to the OAS.  Like Godoy, Moreira owes his </p><p>allegiance directly to Portillo.  (Note:  Godoy resigned </p><p>under pressure from the Vice President, after enduring </p><p>constant potshots from the VP inside the Cabinet.  End Note.) </p><p> Moreira\'s relations with Reyes Lopez and Rios Montt are not </p><p>known. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) Prior to becoming minister, Moreira was serving as </p><p>Portillo\'s private sub-secretary after being named in June </p><p>2001 as GOG Commissioner for the Promotion of Transparency </p><p>and Against Corruption (he complained publicly about lack of </p><p>funding for that commission in February 2002, but retains the </p><p>title).  At the outset of the Portillo Administration Moreira </p><p>served as sub-secretary of Strategic Analysis under </p><p>now-Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez.  He is a close friend </p><p>of the First Lady. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU) In May 2002, Moreira was arrested and jailed for </p><p>contempt of court after failing to appear at an earlier </p><p>hearing on charges which dogged him from his position as head </p><p>of the business department of the electricity institute (he </p><p>pleaded illness).  He was released on bail after three weeks </p><p>and later acquitted.  (He joked to the Ambassador that given </p><p>the difficulty of resolving the teachers\' strike, he was </p><p>better off in jail.)  Moreira is reportedly a former member </p><p>of the Guatemalan Workers Party (PGT) and a former member of </p><p>a Marxist group called "January 6th."  An economist and </p><p>social scientist by training, Moreira worked on the </p><p>Historical Memory Project under assassinated Bishop Gerardi </p><p>and also worked for the Myrna Mack foundation.  Moreira is 38 </p><p>years old and his wife is half-British. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU) Moreira\'s feisty ministerial approach has already </p><p>raised hackles in both CACIF and organized labor.  CACIF is </p><p>privately furious that, after giving lip service to dialogue, </p><p>he referred to management\'s representatives on the board of </p><p>the national training institute (INTECAP) as hypocritical for </p><p>being "bloodily repressive" to their own workers and </p><p>characterizing the private sector in general as a "genocidal </p><p>oligarchy."  An intense man, Moreira gives the impression </p><p>that he is spoiling for the fight with the private sector, </p><p>which seems inevitable in an election year.  His earlier, </p><p>more ambitious legislative package, outlined to LabAtt on </p><p>February 4, seemed designed to provoke that fight, and CACIF </p><p>vows to reverse anything the FRG passes that it does not </p><p>like. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Meanwhile, Moreira\'s relations with organized </p><p>labor are not looking much better.  Union leaders believe he </p><p>was named to replace Godoy because Godoy refused to use tough </p><p>tactics to bring the striking teachers to heel:  the ministry </p><p>has processed thousands of penalties against individual </p><p>teachers for absenteeism during the strike, and labor courts </p><p>have ruled the strike illegal, making strikers liable to lose </p><p>their jobs and even pay damages (unlikely to enforced).  Top </p><p>labor leaders are also unhappy with Moreira\'s autocratic </p><p>manner and lack of respect in tripartite meetings, and are </p><p>particularly concerned about his inclusion of "no-fault" </p><p>severance pay in his legislative priorities.  They worry that </p><p>management will use this tool to rid employee ranks of union </p><p>members. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) Moreira strikes us as serious about protecting </p><p>labor rights, but politically vulnerable and wholly dependent </p><p>on Portillo\'s support.  Clearly smarting from the bruising </p><p>(and ongoing) teachers\' strike and the cool reception from </p><p>organized labor and private sector members of the tripartite </p><p>labor policy commission, Moreira has already scaled back his </p><p>agenda in the short time since taking office.  We will </p><p>continue to press the minister to take steps to meet GSP </p><p>labor conditions, but will also need to look elsewhere for </p><p>stronger allies to be assured of progress. </p><p> </p><p>Union Leader Concerns </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) The Ambassador also discussed labor rights and the </p><p>GSP petitions February 13 with four prominent labor leaders: </p><p>Jose Pinzon, Secretary General of the CGTG industrial union </p><p>and leader of the main labor federation (UGT); Nery Barrios, </p><p>Secretary General of the other main federation (UASP); Julio </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>Coj, Secretary of the independent UNSITRAGUA federation, and </p><p>Carlos Mancilla, Secretary General of the CUSG federation, </p><p>also a member of the UGT.  The union leaders complained about </p><p>the lack of political will to support freedom of association; </p><p>urged the USG to incorporate strong labor protections into </p><p>the CAFTA to replace those under GSP, and thanked the USG for </p><p>applying GSP conditions to leverage progress from the GOG in </p><p>the past.  In response to the Ambassador\'s question, the </p><p>union leaders said U.S. multinational firms are no better </p><p>than local ones at respecting the right to association (he </p><p>cited the maquila sector, Coke, and Pepsi, specifically). </p><p>(Note:  Working conditions, including salaries, are </p><p>significantly better than average in U.S. operations than </p><p>elsewhere here.  End Note.) </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
