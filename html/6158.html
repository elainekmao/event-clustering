(C) Summary:  BP and BOTAS General Manager Bildaci are </p><p>still concerned that BOTAS does not have sufficient authority </p><p>to meet its obligations under the BTC turnkey contract.  BP </p><p>has sent a letter to Energy Minister Guler requesting his </p><p>personal intervention on this issue; Bildaci is raising it </p><p>directly with Guler and Foreign Minister Yakis March 6.  TPAO </p><p>is still waiting for a response from the World Bank on </p><p>applicability of the negative pledge clause; officials may </p><p>raise this issue with CBED Amb. Mann during his March 12 </p><p>visit to Ankara.  Bildaci expects BOTAS and DEPA to sign the </p><p>Turkey-Greece Interconnector sales purchase agreement in </p><p>March, prior to which he will seek Amb. Mann\'s help in </p><p>increasing the volumes to which DEPA commits.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Oil Pipeline </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Although BTC construction in Turkey is on schedule and </p><p>on budget, there is still concern that BOTAS does not have </p><p>sufficient authority to make and implement key operational </p><p>decisions, which could ultimately slow construction and lead </p><p>to cost overruns (ref b).  BP Associate President Woodward </p><p>told us he raised this issue with Energy Minister Guler </p><p>during their February 7 meeting, emphasizing that BOTAS must </p><p>have sufficient authority to carry outs its responsibilities </p><p>under the BTC turnkey contract.  (Note, however, that </p><p>Woodward also told us that Turkey was in "very good shape" on </p><p>the technical side of BTC.)  BP then followed up with a </p><p>letter from BTC CEO Townshend to the Minister specifically </p><p>requesting that Guler give the BOTAS General Manager the </p><p>authority to enter into and manage contracts under USD 10 </p><p>million, and that he instruct the BOTAS Board of Directors </p><p>that BTC funds should be managed like those of a private </p><p>venture. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) A BP executive told econoff that GM Bildaci, at some </p><p>personal risk, was doing his best to meet BOTAS\'s obligations </p><p>under the contract, but was obstructed by other government </p><p>agencies at every turn.  For example, the Treasury had </p><p>recently requested an investigation into the BOTAS BTC </p><p>Directorate\'s budget based on a reported increase in </p><p>management costs of the project.  The BP exec said this </p><p>investigation was laughable, since BOTAS is installing the </p><p>BTC pipe in Turkey at a cost far below the world average. </p><p>For example, he said, the average cost of installed pipe in </p><p>Georgia was USD 46/meter, in Azerbaijan USD 27/meter, and in </p><p>Turkey about USD 14/meter.  Instead of taking up precious </p><p>time with a useless investigation, the exec argued, Treasury </p><p>should be commending BOTAS on its success in shrewdly </p><p>negotiating the BTC sub-contracts and in keeping management </p><p>costs as low as they are. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) BOTAS General Manager Bildaci shares BP\'s frustration. </p><p> He told econoff March 5 that Minister Guler repeatedly </p><p>claimed to "support" BOTAS; however, Bildaci said, he needed </p><p>freedom more than support.  In order to manage an </p><p>international, USD 1.4 billion contract on a strict deadline </p><p>and budget, he could not apply to 5 different government </p><p>agencies for approval every time he wanted to hire new </p><p>personnel, conduct a feasibility study, or pay for </p><p>consultants.  Bildaci said he was meeting with the Energy </p><p>Minister and Foreign Minister on March 6 to discuss the BP </p><p>letter.  He would argue at that meeting that BOTAS should be </p><p>removed from the decree that oversees state entities. </p><p>Otherwise, it would be very difficult to meet the </p><p>requirements of the BTC turnkey contract. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Shah Deniz Gas Pipeline/TPAO Financing </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) Ministry of Energy and BOTAS officials are pleased </p><p>about the recent sanction of Shah Deniz, but are seeking </p><p>details about plans for a sanction ceremony in Baku in March </p><p>or April, claiming that they have no definitive information </p><p>regarding an event.  The MENR Pipelines Department Head had </p><p>not been informed that President Sezer had been invited to </p><p>Baku, although this may be due to a lack of internal </p><p>coordination. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) The Turkish Petroleum Agency (TPAO) continues to </p><p>assess its financing options for Shah Deniz and its other </p><p>Caspian projects.  TPAO still has not received a definitive </p><p>response from the World Bank regarding applicability of the </p><p>negative pledge clause to TPAO, although TPAO officials told </p><p>econoff there have been "indications" that the response will </p><p>be negative.  GOT officials may raise the negative pledge </p><p>clause issue with CBED Amb. Mann during his March 12 visit to </p><p>Ankara. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Turkey-Greece Interconnector </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) BOTAS General Manager Bildaci told econoff that he had </p><p>accompanied Minister Guler to Athens for the signing of the </p><p>intergovernmental agreement for the Interconnector </p><p>Turkey-Greece, or "ITG" (ref a).  Like DEPA officials (ref </p><p>a), Bildaci expects that DEPA and BOTAS will sign the gas </p><p>sales purchase agreement (SPA) in March.  Bildaci noted that </p><p>DEPA wanted to modify 12 articles in the draft SPA, but said </p><p>the changes should not be deal breakers.  Now that Shah Deniz </p><p>had been sanctioned, Bildaci said, BOTAS had more flexibility </p><p>on price as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Bildaci said he would be seeking CBED Ambassador </p><p>Mann\'s support in encouraging DEPA to commit to taking 2-3 </p><p>bcm of gas annually through the ITG, ramping up over several </p><p>years from the 1/2 bcm to which DEPA is currently committed </p><p>to taking.  BOTAS had the right to re-export all the Shah </p><p>Deniz gas it would import under that sales purchase </p><p>agreement, so he hoped to export more of it to Greece. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) Bildaci noted that BOTAS, DEPA, and the Italian </p><p>company Edison had recently had good negotiations in </p><p>Istanbul, where they had discussed Edison eventually </p><p>importing 8 bcm annually from Turkey through Greece.  The </p><p>next step, he said, was to conduct a feasibility study of a </p><p>Greece-Italy line. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
