<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ABUJA 001190 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>THE HAGUE FOR OPCW DEL (MIKULAK); LONDON FOR GURNEY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: 15 APR 2012 </p><p>TAGS: PARM, PREL, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA ON BUSTANI -- HELP US CONVINCE AFRICA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>ABUJA 1160 AND PREVIOUS (NOTAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY CDA ANDREWS.  REASON:  1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) DCM April 16 spoke with Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, </p><p>Chairman of Nigeria\'s National Council on the OPCW. </p><p>Baba-Ahmed said Nigeria intended to vote for Bustani\'s </p><p>removal and that he saw little likelihood of that </p><p>position changing.  However, taking this stance had </p><p>put Nigeria "far from [its] natural allies...in the </p><p>African Group." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) Baba-Ahmed thought a "well-packaged approach" </p><p>in support of Bustani\'s removal "targeted at African </p><p>and Asian countries without a strategic interest in </p><p>OPCW" would reduce resistance to the USG initiative. </p><p>As leader of the African Group in the OPCW, Nigeria </p><p>now needed to bring along other countries.  While </p><p>Nigeria had no strategic interest in the OPCW, it had </p><p>a strong strategic interest in sustaining its regional </p><p>leadership role and could not afford to be too far out </p><p>in front of too many other African countries, Baba- </p><p>Ahmed continued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Nigeria, through Ambassador Dosunmu-Awolowo in </p><p>The Hague, was endeavoring to convince other Africans </p><p>that Africa had nothing to gain by Bustani\'s retention </p><p>and that OPCW would face severe difficulties if the </p><p>U.S. were to withdraw support, Baba-Ahmed said. </p><p>Nigeria hoped that the USG would continue to lobby </p><p>other Africans energetically, highlighting that those </p><p>programs from which Africa benefits (international </p><p>cooperative assistance, training, recruitment of </p><p>staff, etc.) would suffer no negative impact from </p><p>Bustani\'s removal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C) Baba-Ahmed also asked DCM if there were </p><p>"strategic reasons" other than those outlined in </p><p>previous demarches for U.S. opposition to Bustani. </p><p>DCM briefly recapitulated our concerns, said he was </p><p>unaware of other considerations, and suggested that he </p><p>(Baba-Ahmed) or Dosunmu-Awolowo contact USDEL experts </p><p>if Nigeria had specific questions.  Baba-Ahmed </p><p>reiterated that Nigeria had announced its position in </p><p>favor of removing Bustani and would be most unlikely </p><p>to change it.  But the GON would have an additional </p><p>level of comfort if it felt certain it understood all </p><p>the issues, he added. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Comment: There is a tendency here to look for </p><p>hidden agendas; USDEL may wish to seek out Baba-Ahmed </p><p>in The Hague (he plans to arrive morning of April 20). </p><p>Having taken a decision to support the USG on Bustani, </p><p>Nigeria is unlikely to change course.  However, the </p><p>possibility cannot be ruled out completely if fellow </p><p>African countries exert strong pressure in the other </p><p>direction. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
