SUMMARY: Systematic UN monitoring of humanitarian </p><p>assistance flows in Zimbabwe appears--finally--to be on the </p><p>verge of proceeding.  Two of the expatriate staff who will </p><p>conduct this effort are on the ground, and plan shortly to </p><p>open the first of five offices.  Limited monitoring will </p><p>begin in February, although it is unclear how successful the </p><p>new unit will be in monitoring government-controlled food </p><p>deliveries.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p>INITIAL NEGOTIATIONS DELAYED START UP </p><p>------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  On January 9, PolOff spoke with George Olesh, head of the </p><p>UN Relief and Recovery Unit (RRU) Relief and Information </p><p>Verification Office (RIVO) to discuss its status. The RIVO </p><p>was created to provide regular, unbiased reports on food aid </p><p>distributions by both donors and government.  Serious </p><p>discussions between the UN and donors began several months </p><p>ago, and the EU agreed to partially fund the office, but </p><p>final contract resolution was bogged down in EU bureaucracy, </p><p>and until the final document was signed with the EU in early </p><p>January 2003, the UN RRU only had a verbal agreement.  The </p><p>rest of the RRU funding came from the U.S. Britain, Sweden, </p><p>and Canada.  In early November, donors were concerned about </p><p>RRU management and its ability to handle an additional </p><p>caseload such as the RIVO.  In addition to the funding </p><p>constraints, the RRU was extremely understaffed with three </p><p>people doing the work of seven.  (See Reftels). </p><p> </p><p>3.  Without a firm commitment from the EU, which the RRU </p><p>received verbally in late November/early December, the RRU </p><p>could not initiate hiring from the main UN Volunteers office </p><p>in Bonn, Germany.  RIVO finally received two of the requested </p><p>six International UN Volunteers field monitors (UNVs) in </p><p>mid-December--a Malawian woman who previously worked in </p><p>Myanmar, and a Kenyan man who was in East Timor.  To date, </p><p>these two new expatriate staff members have been working </p><p>exclusively in Harare to get them up to speed on the </p><p>situation and also because the unit just received on/about </p><p>January 10 the two vehicles it purchased in October. </p><p>According to Olesh, the vehicles will be licensed and insured </p><p>by the end of next week and Olesh plans to take the UNVs to </p><p>Mutare soon thereafter.  (NOTE: The vehicles had been stuck </p><p>at the Beitbridge border post since early December. END </p><p>NOTE.)  Olesh told us he will need to ask Bonn for additional </p><p>CVs to review for the remaining four slots.  RIVO has only </p><p>just begun advertising for local hire positions. </p><p> </p><p>-------------- </p><p>MODUS OPERANDI </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. The RIVO plans to set up its first field office in Mutare </p><p>in Manicaland, near the Mozambique border.  Olesh told us </p><p>they decided on Mutare because of the extensive cross-border </p><p>traffic, the nearby commercial farms and displaced </p><p>farmworkers, an increase in cholera and malaria in the area, </p><p>and a provincial governor who is more inclined to work with </p><p>the UN than her counterparts in other provinces.  Olesh </p><p>indicated that if Governor Oppah Muchinguri cooperates and </p><p>facilitates the acquisition of office space, the collection </p><p>of Grain Marketing Board information, and the disclosure of </p><p>GOZ food-for-work programs, the RIVO might be able to use the </p><p>Manicaland experience as positive leverage in other </p><p>provinces.  For each office, the RIVO needs to install office </p><p>equipment, procure transportation and information technology </p><p>(VHF radios, phone and internet connections, satellite </p><p>phones, digital cameras), and recruit program and support </p><p>staff.  The RIVO plans to open offices in Masvingo </p><p>(February/March), Bulawayo (January/February), and Chinhoyi </p><p>(February/March) and to deploy the UNVs at the provincial </p><p>level to work in collaboration at the district level with all </p><p>stakeholders in monitoring beneficiary targeting and </p><p>assessment, data collection, verification and monitoring of </p><p>humanitarian assistance flows. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>MANY OBSTACLES TO SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>5.  Olesh told us that one of the biggest challenges his </p><p>office will face in the field is assuaging the concerns of </p><p>government officials that the RRU/RIVO are conducting </p><p>subversive activities.  To guard against this, the RIVO will </p><p>be as open and transparent as possible, providing provincial </p><p>governors with exhaustive documents explaining the RIVO\'s </p><p>purpose and activities.  Lower level government officials </p><p>will receive a one-page tri-fold color pamphlet conveying the </p><p>same information. The RRU hopes that a continued dialogue and </p><p>field presence will facilitate the release of government </p><p>data. </p><p> </p><p>6.  According to the UN RRU RIV Section Workplan 2003 </p><p>distributed to government and donor stakeholders, the RIVO </p><p>faces many obstacles to accomplishing its sensitive tasks </p><p>given the  difficult operating environment within many parts </p><p>of rural Zimbabwe.  Among these are the scale of the crisis, </p><p>polarization, distrust between donors and government, </p><p>reluctant collaboration of government with NGOs and donors, </p><p>poor transparency of government food policies, personnel </p><p>security, lack of international media presence, and </p><p>sensationalized local media reporting. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  It seems the long-awaited "independent" capacity for </p><p>monitoring food aid flows in Zimbabwe is finally ready to </p><p>proceed.  The UN/RRU RIVO represents the best mechanism </p><p>available under the circumstances for obtaining objective, </p><p>reliable information on this important subject.  The </p><p>obstacles to successful unit operations are real in the </p><p>highly charged and controlled operating environment in </p><p>Zimbabwe today.  The UN believes it has the mandate to </p><p>monitor all food deliveries--including those provided by </p><p>government--but the GOZ will not be an enthusiastic partner </p><p>in this endeavor.  However, with the collective support of </p><p>the greater UN and international donor community and close </p><p>collaboration with established international and local NGO </p><p>networks already engaged in similar monitoring activities, we </p><p>are hopeful that the unit will be able to proceed with its </p><p>sensitive task.  (See septel for government reaction to donor </p><p>suggestions for UN monitoring of GMB food deliveries.) END </p><p>COMMENT. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
