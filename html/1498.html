<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KINSHASA 000461 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/26/2010 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, CG </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH JOSEPH KABILA </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS </p><p>1.5(B)(D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>1. (C) SUMMARY: </p><p>------------------ </p><p> </p><p>AMBASSADOR SWING MET WITH PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE JOSEPH KABILA </p><p>FOR AN HOUR LATE AFTERNOON OF JANUARY 25 AT KABILA\'S OAU </p><p>VILLAGE OFFICE.  THE AMBASSADOR PRESENTED KABILA WITH </p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE AND OFFERED HIS OWN </p><p>VERBAL CONDOLENCES ON THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA. </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR ALSO GAVE KABILA THE INVITATION TO THE </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST ON FEBRUARY 1; KABILA </p><p>SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTICIPATING AND </p><p>PROMISED HIS ANSWER JANUARY 26.  THE AMBASSADOR OUTLINED THE </p><p>CONSIDERATIONS UNDERLYING THE EMBASSY\'S DRAWDOWN.  KABILA </p><p>STRESSED THROUGHOUT THE TALK HIS PREOCCUPATION WITH THE WAR </p><p>AND THE SUFFERING OF THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE; APPEALED FOR MONUC </p><p>TO DEPLOY AND FOR RWANDAN AND UGANDAN TROOPS TO DEPART. </p><p>KABILA GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING SEIZED WITH THE HEAVY </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY HE HAS INHERITED, AND ACUTELY AWARE OF THE </p><p>LEGITIMACY ISSUE POSED BY HIS SELECTION, WHICH SEEMS TO </p><p>INCLINE HIM TOWARD A POLICY OF GREATER OPENNESS WITH REGARD </p><p>TO THE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p>2. (C) A "PATRIOT WHO SYMBOLIZED OUR HOPES" </p><p>-------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR, UNACCOMPANIED, MET WITH JOSEPH KABILA FOR AN </p><p>HOUR ON JANUARY 25.  FOREIGN MINISTER OKITUNDU, PRESIDENT </p><p>CABINET DIRECTOR GEORGES BUSE AND STATE SECURITY COUNCIL </p><p>CHIEF NONO LUTULA WERE ALSO PRESENT. </p><p> </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR BEGAN BY PRESENTING PRESIDENT BUSH\'S </p><p>CONDOLENCE MESSAGE TO KABILA, FOR WHICH KABILA EXPRESSED WARM </p><p>APPRECIATION.  IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MESSAGE AND </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR\'S VERBAL CONDOLENCES, JOSEPH KABILA DESCRIBED </p><p>HIS LATE FATHER AS A "PATRIOT WHO SYMBOLIZED THE CONGOLESE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS WHICH WE MUST NOW SHOULDER." </p><p>THIS WILL NOT BE EASY, HE SAID, BUT "WE ARE BOUND BY THE </p><p>REALITIES WE FACE TO FIND SOLUTIONS." </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p>3. (C) KNITTING THE CONGO BACK INTO THE </p><p>       WORLD\'S FABRIC </p><p>----------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE KABILA EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF </p><p>"MAKING CONTACTS" WITH A WORLD "THAT IS CHANGING FAST."  IN </p><p>THIS REGARD HE SAID THAT ALREADY SINCE HIS FATHER\'S DEATH AND </p><p>PARTICULARLY AT THE FUNERAL THIS WEEK, HE HAD SPOKEN WITH </p><p>"MANY" FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVES, EACH WITH A SOMEWHAT </p><p>DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT ON HOW BEST TO ADDRESS CONGO\'S PROBLEMS. </p><p>FOR HIMSELF, THE MOST ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IS TO FIND A WAY TO </p><p>END THE WAR.  THIS MEANS GETTING THE OCCUPYING ARMIES OUT OF </p><p>THE DRC, AND IN THIS REGARD THE WORLD COMMUNITY, AND MOST </p><p>ESPECIALLY THE U.S. AS ITS STRONGEST MEMBER, HAVE A SPECIAL </p><p>RESPONSIBILITY.  EARLY ELECTIONS, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO </p><p>DEMOCRACY, ARE BEING DELAYED BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS </p><p>"OCCUPIED." </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p>4. (C) WAR\'S FRUITS:  "MAYHEM, </p><p>       DESTRUCTION AND REFUGEES" </p><p>--------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE DRC HAS NOW BEEN UNDER "OCCUPATION," HE CONTINUED, FOR </p><p>NEARLY THREE YEARS.  AS A RESULT, THERE HAS BEEN "MUCH MAYHEM </p><p>-- DESTRUCTION, MURDER, AND THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES AND </p><p>INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS."  THERE WERE NO CONGOLESE </p><p>REFUGEES BEFORE THE WAR, HE ASSERTED, BUT TODAY CONGOLESE ARE </p><p>FLEEING FROM BUNIA, FOR EXAMPLE, INTO UGANDA. </p><p> </p><p>RWANDA AND UGANDA JUSTIFY THE PRESENCE OF THEIR ARMIES IN THE </p><p>CONGO ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY MUST COMBAT THE SECURITY </p><p>THREAT WHICH THE INTERAHAMWE POSES, KABILA SAID.  THE </p><p>INTERAHAMWE ARGUMENT CANNOT BE USED, HOWEVER, TO EXPLAIN WHY </p><p>RWANDAN AND UGANDAN FORCES ARE SO DEEP INSIDE CONGOLESE </p><p>TERRITORY, MORE THAN A THOUSAND KILOMETERS FROM THEIR </p><p>BORDERS; NOR WILL THE INTERAHAMWE CLAIM ADEQUATELY JUSTIFY </p><p>RWANDA\'S AND UGANDA\'S "RIPPING OFF" THE DRC\'S NATURAL </p><p>RESOURCES FOR WHICH, HE OBSERVED, A SPECIAL UN COMMISSION OF </p><p>INQUIRY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p>5. (C) RAISING CONGO WAR\'S PROFILE </p><p>----------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE WORLD SPEAKS ONLY OF THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE, BUT DOES NOT </p><p>MENTION THAT 1.7 MILLION CONGOLESE ARE SAID TO HAVE DIED IN </p><p>THE CONGO AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT WAR.  "LET\'S NOT LET </p><p>LAURENT KABILA DIE FOR NOTHING."  RATHER, HE SAID, KABILA\'S </p><p>LIFE AND DEATH WERE A "PEACE OFFERING."  HE URGED THE U.S TO </p><p>LOOK AT THE CONGO "IN A WIDER CONTEXT OF THE GREAT LAKES </p><p>SUB-REGION," WHICH, HE SAID, IS WHAT HIS LATE FATHER WAS </p><p>DOING  "LET JUSTICE BE DONE," HE SAID.  FOR THIS TO HAPPEN, </p><p>THE U.S. MUST TAKE ITS CONGO POLICY TO A "HIGHER LEVEL." </p><p> </p><p>WHEN THEY MET, KABILA SAID HE HAD ASKED UN SRSG MORJANE WHERE </p><p>THE UN TROOPS ARE.  FROM LATTER\'S RESPONSE, KABILA SAID, HE </p><p>HAD THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE STILL A LONG WAYS OFF.  KABILA </p><p>APPEALED TO THE AMBASSADOR FOR THE U.S. TO PUT "PRESSURE" ON </p><p>RWANDA, UGANDA AND BURUNDI TO WITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS FROM THE </p><p>DRC.  THEY SHOULD BE CONFRONTED AS TO WHY THEIR TROOPS ARE IN </p><p>THE CONGO, THEN TOLD THAT EITHER THEY LEAVE, OR RISK </p><p>INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p>6. (C) POSSIBLE PRAYER BREAKFAST </p><p>       PARTICIPATION </p><p>-------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE KABILA EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE </p><p>CONGRESSIONAL INVITATION TO THE ANNUAL NATIONAL PRAYER </p><p>BREAKFAST ON FEBRUARY 1.  HE AGREED THAT THIS REPRESENTS A </p><p>UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY, TOO GOOD TO BE PASSED UP.  ON THE OTHER </p><p>HAND, HE POINTED OUT THAT HIS PRIMARY CONCERN AT THE MOMENT </p><p>IS FOR THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OF THE CONGO.  THEREFORE, </p><p>HE WOULD HAVE TO CONSULT WITH HIS CABINET COLLEAGUES; HE SAID </p><p>THEY WOULD NEED TWELVE HOURS IN ORDER "TO STUDY" THE </p><p>INVITATION.  HE ASKED FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THE PROGRAM AND </p><p>A LIST OF THE OTHER FOREIGN HEADS OF STATE INVITED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p>7. (C) EMBASSY DRAWDOWN PRECAUTIONARY </p><p>       AND TEMPORARY </p><p>--------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THE </p><p>CONSIDERATIONS UNDERLYING THE EMBASSY\'S CURRENT DRAWDOWN OF </p><p>ITS PERSONNEL COMPLEMENT.  HE DESCRIBED THE DRAWDOWN AS A </p><p>"PRECAUTIONARY, PRUDENT" MEASURE.  THE DRAWDOWN IS TEMPORARY, </p><p>NOT PERMANENT, AND IS NOT AN EVACUATION.  THE AMBASSADOR </p><p>EMPHASIZED THAT THIS ACTION DOES NOT IN ANY WAY REFLECT ANY </p><p>LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS </p><p>HANDLED THE AFFAIRS OF STATE SINCE KABILA\'S DEATH; IN FACT, </p><p>HE SAID, HE AND THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY GENERALLY HAD BEEN </p><p>IMPRESSED WITH THEIR SMOOTH HANDLING OF THE TRANSITION. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>8. (C) COMMENT: </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>ON THE EVE OF HIS OFFICIAL INAUGURATION AS PRESIDENT AND </p><p>SUCCESSOR TO HIS SLAIN FATHER, JOSEPH KABILA, WHOM THE </p><p>AMBASSADOR HAD LAST SEEN IN NOVEMBER, MADE THE IMPRESSION OF </p><p>ONE WHO SENSES THAT, INEXORABLY, THE COMPLEX BURDENS OF THIS </p><p>VAST, BELEAGUERED COUNTRY ARE COMING TO REST ON HIS </p><p>SHOULDERS.  VARIOUS INTERESTS WITHIN THE DISPARATE, </p><p>INTERNALLY-COMPETING AND OFTEN CONTRADICTORY POWER STRUCTURE </p><p>ARE ALREADY VYING FOR HIS TIME AND ATTENTION AS THEY SEEK AT </p><p>LEAST TO RETAIN, AND TO INCREASE IF POSSIBLE WHATEVER </p><p>INFLUENCE THEY MAY HAVE HAD WITH HIS FATHER -- HENCE, THE </p><p>THREE SENIOR PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEETING, FOR EXAMPLE.  THIS </p><p>PERHAPS ALSO EXPLAINS JOSEPH KABILA\'S INSISTENCE ON USING </p><p>ENGLISH THROUGH MOST OF THE CONVERSATION (A LANGUAGE IN WHICH </p><p>NONE OF THE OTHER THREE PARTICIPANTS IS VERSED), ALTHOUGH HIS </p><p>FRENCH IS FLUENT. </p><p> </p><p>ALTHOUGH AT FIRST IMPRESSION SHY, THE PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE IS </p><p>SOFT-SPOKEN, BUT SELF-ASSURED AND ARTICULATE.  HE PROJECTS </p><p>THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE AN APPEALING, PROFESSIONAL IMAGE FOR </p><p>HIS COUNTRY.  HIS ACUTE AWARENESS OF THE LEGITIMACY ISSUE AND </p><p>HIS OWN LIMITED EXPERIENCE MAY WELL INCLINE HIM TO REACH OUT </p><p>AND OPEN UP THE POLITICAL PROCESS, SET A REASONABLE DATE FOR </p><p>ELECTIONS, EVEN THOUGH MAKING THESE CONTINGENT UPON ALL OF </p><p>THE BELLIGERENTS AND THE "INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S" </p><p>SUCCESSFULLY SUING FOR PEACE AND A WITHDRAWAL OF RWANDAN AND </p><p>UGANDAN FORCES. </p><p> </p><p>KABILA IMMEDIATELY GRASPED THE IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY WHICH </p><p>THE PRAYER BREAKFAST INVITATION REPRESENTS FOR THE DRC.  HE </p><p>IS AGONIZING, HOWEVER, OVER THE DILEMMA OF SQUARING THIS </p><p>TRIP, LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER HIS INAUGURATION, WITH HIS TOP </p><p>IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE OF MAINTAINING STABILITY AND CALM IN THE </p><p>WAKE OF FATHER LAURENT KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION. </p><p> </p><p>SWING </p><p></p></div>
