<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 002007 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, ECON, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: ZARQA BUSINESS COMMUNITY EYES PARLIAMENTARY </p><p>ELECTIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sensitive but unclassified; please protect accordingly. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1.  (sbu)  Although they doubt elections will occur as </p><p>scheduled on June 17, business leaders in Jordan\'s main </p><p>industrial center believe a new parliament will redress the </p><p>balance of political power in Jordan, giving areas outside </p><p>Amman a greater voice in policy decisions.  While a new </p><p>parliament may complicate the economic reform process, giving </p><p>elected representatives more say should serve to strengthen </p><p>economic performance over time as the development of </p><p>democratic institutions and formal, constructive channels for </p><p>dissent gives investors greater confidence in the continuity </p><p>of the application of rule of law in Jordan.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS - DOUBTS ON TIMING </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>2.  (sbu)  In a March 19 meeting, Board members of the Zarqa </p><p>Chamber of Industry welcomed the King\'s announcement that </p><p>parliamentary elections would be held in June.  They doubted, </p><p>though, that elections would actually be held at that time. </p><p>They noted that "no one is paying any attention" to the </p><p>prospect of elections or campaigning by candidates, as most </p><p>Jordanians have been riveted instead to the (then) prelude to </p><p>war in Iraq and, to a lesser extent, ongoing Arab-Israeli </p><p>violence.  Indeed, they said most candidates for </p><p>Zarqa-designated seats were not campaigning vigorously, </p><p>calculating that the effort would be wasted on a target </p><p>population that was seemingly uninterested and distracted by </p><p>more immediate concerns. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (sbu)  Mohammed Arsalan, Board Secretary and a candidate </p><p>himself for the "Chechen" seat for Zarqa, echoed these </p><p>remarks, noting he had put his own campaigning activity on </p><p>hold for the time being.  He said it had become increasingly </p><p>difficult to solicit endorsements (including, he winked, from </p><p>the Chamber of Industry), since key interest groups were </p><p>unwilling to commit to a candidate without sizing up their </p><p>options, something they had no time for as war loomed. </p><p>Arsalan and the other Board members predicted elections would </p><p>more likely be postponed until the fall, to allow for </p><p>sufficient campaigning time between the shake-out of Iraq and </p><p>election day.  They agreed that such a delay would not cost </p><p>the government any real political capital, since Jordanians </p><p>have come to expect such things, and noted that such a delay </p><p>might benefit more moderate candidates, who would be able to </p><p>put time between the elections and any remaining raw emotions </p><p>as a result of the war. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE ANTICIPATED </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  (sbu)  Once parliament is convened, though, the board was </p><p>optimistic about its role in governing Jordan.  They saw the </p><p>parliament playing an important role as a sounding board for </p><p>popular and regional concerns about government policies, </p><p>which would - they hoped - prompt the government to be more </p><p>responsive to constituent concerns.  They were specifically </p><p>NOT worried about the prospects of Islamist control of </p><p>parliament, either directly through blocs of IAF-controlled </p><p>seats, or indirectly through election of Islamic sympathizers </p><p>to regional seats.  They pointed out that, even at their </p><p>height, Islamists held less than 20% of all seats in </p><p>parliament.  Indeed, some Board members thought seats in </p><p>parliament might serve to moderate the Islamic opposition, </p><p>giving them a voice in government that had lately been denied </p><p>to them. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (sbu)  More importantly, the Zarqa Chamber\'s leaders saw </p><p>a new parliament as a vehicle to move some decision-making </p><p>power on economic issues out of Amman.  Board members have </p><p>long complained (along with their colleagues in Irbid) that </p><p>government policy is too Amman-centric, rarely taking into </p><p>account the concerns of large communities outside the </p><p>capital.  They saw influence with MP\'s as a way to redress </p><p>this imbalance, notably by educating and encouraging regional </p><p>MP\'s to ask for amendments to new legislation - like the new </p><p>Chambers of Industry Law - that negatively impacted the </p><p>regions but was drafted by and for Amman business leaders. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (sbu)  Arsalan noted that parliament gave interest groups </p><p>a unique opportunity to influence policy.  Most MP\'s, he </p><p>said, are very weak on substantive issues - especially in the </p><p>economy - but are willing and eager to accept advice and </p><p>guidance from constituents.  In the last parliament, for </p><p>example, he said he fed his MP talking points by mobile phone </p><p>on an economic issue while the issue was being debated on the </p><p>floor - points the MP repeated verbatim during the debate. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p>CHANGES TO TEMPORARY LAWS UNLIKELY </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7.  (sbu)  The Board noted that, while they expected to have </p><p>some entree on new legislation, their ability to effect </p><p>changes to temporary laws already passed by the government </p><p>during the parliament\'s absence was much more restricted. </p><p>They did not expect a new parliament to attempt to amend any </p><p>temporary laws brought forward by the government that touched </p><p>on any of the King\'s priorities - including most economic </p><p>reform legislation. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (sbu)  In a similar vein, since the government controls </p><p>the order in which temporary laws are brought to the </p><p>parliament for formal ratification, the board thought it </p><p>likely that the government would simply back-load any </p><p>potentially controversial temporary laws until they had time </p><p>to discuss these laws informally with MP\'s or until future </p><p>elections brought more like-minded MP\'s to the fore.  With </p><p>the raft of temporary laws passed during parliament\'s </p><p>absence, the Board said it would in any case be years before </p><p>any potentially contentious temporary laws made it to the </p><p>floor. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9.  (sbu)  The Zarqa Chamber is one of Jordan\'s more </p><p>forward-looking business bodies and is broadly supportive of </p><p>the King\'s economic agenda.  Most members support QIZ </p><p>activity and the FTA and actively participate in trade </p><p>relation-building events with the Embassy and Jordan\'s </p><p>AmCham.  They pride themselves on separating business from </p><p>politics, unlike their sister Chamber in Amman, they claim. </p><p>They are, however, ritually concerned about center-periphery </p><p>relations both in politics and economics (despite most of </p><p>them maintaining residences in Amman), as they have benefited </p><p>greatly from economic reform policies that have put </p><p>relatively more economic control into the hands of the </p><p>private sector - and hence of the regions. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (sbu)  The Chamber\'s thoughts on the potentially </p><p>constructive role for a new parliament is an interesting </p><p>counterpoint to those who believe parliament will create more </p><p>opportunities for vested interests to block or slow down </p><p>economic reforms.  We agree with the assessment that a new </p><p>parliament is unlikely to try to reverse progress made under </p><p>temporary laws over the past three years.  However, bringing </p><p>new legislation before parliament will provide an excellent </p><p>opportunity for a host of vested interest groups - many with </p><p>"old-economy" ties - to use parliamentary procedures to slow </p><p>the pace of reform, in particular by distorting individual </p><p>reform initiatives. </p><p> </p><p>11.  (sbu)  Even a flawed economic reform process, though, </p><p>would likely serve to legitimize the parliament and Jordan\'s </p><p>democratization efforts.  A meaningful democratic process </p><p>would, in turn, enhance investor confidence in the </p><p>application of the rule of law in Jordan, and thus provide a </p><p>long-term boost to the country\'s economic process.  It would </p><p>also force MP\'s to take responsibility for economic decisions </p><p>instead of criticizing from the sidelines, thereby moderating </p><p>some of the anti-government rhetoric often displayed by </p><p>Islamists and other opposition groups. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
