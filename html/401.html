<p>S E C R E T KUWAIT 04871 </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356 DECL OADR </p><p>TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: TFKU01: CONTACT WITH KUWAITI RESISTANCE </p><p> </p><p>1. EMBASSY RECEIVED A FAX THIS MORNING, AUGUST 28, FROM "A KUWAITI </p><p>CITIZEN" PROPORTING TO REPRESENT THE KUWAITI RESISTANCE.  THE FAX </p><p>WAS ON LETTERHEAD FOR "TECHNICAL CENTRE FOR COMPUTER CONSULTING AND </p><p>SERVICES".  PAGE TWO OF FAX WAS ON LETTERHEAD OF "UNIVERSAL BUREAU </p><p>FOR ECONOMIC CONSULTANT".  NEITHER LETTERHEAD GAVE PHONE NUMBER OR </p><p>ADDRESS, ALTHOUGH FAX NO. FOR TECHNICAL CENTER WAS WRITTEN IN AS: </p><p>2423952.  NO FAX NUMBER WAS GIVEN FOR THE UNIVERSAL BUREAU, EMBASSY </p><p>WAS ALERTED THAT NEXT FAX WOULD BE ON THAT LETTERHEAD. </p><p> </p><p>2. TEXT OF FAX MESSAGE:  I AM CONTACTING YOU ON BEHALF OF DAVID MAC </p><p>(SIC) AND MR. KOBAIY (COVEY?) FROM THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS </p><p>OF U.S. WHOM ALREADY TALKED TO THE AMBASSADOR (SIC).  I HAVE BEEN </p><p>ASKED TO CONTACT YOU CONCERNING WEAPONS.  PLEASE REPLY TO THIS FAX </p><p>(5759348) AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. (SIGNED) KUWAITI RESISTANCE, FOLLOWED </p><p>BY ILLEGIBLE ARABIC SIGNATURE.  END TEXT.  FAX WAS SENT TO THE </p><p>ATTENTION OF "MRS. BARBAR BOADIEN". </p><p> </p><p>3.  COMMENT:  WE PRESUME THIS FAX COMES FROM ONE OF SAUD NASSER\'S </p><p>CONTACTS, BUT WE HAVE NO REASONABLE WAY TO CONFIRM THAT.  WE FIND IT </p><p>DISTURBING THAT A MESSAGE AS OVERT AS THIS WAS SENT VIA FAX LINES. </p><p>WHILE THE IRAQIS MAY HAVE LIMITED CAPABILITY TO INTERCEPT FAXES, </p><p>SINCE THEY PROHIBIT THEM IN IRAQ, WE CANNOT DISCOUNT THAT </p><p>POSSIBILITY OUTRIGHT.  WE ALSO FIND IT DISTURBING THAT THREE USG </p><p>OFFICIALS, ONE STILL IN KUWAIT, ARE IDENTIFIED AS CONTACTS WITH THE </p><p>RESISTANCE ON WEAPONS. </p><p> </p><p>4. ACTION REQUEST:  WE STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT SAUD NASSER BE ADVISED </p><p>TO HAVE HIS CONTACTS CEASE FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS OF THIS SORT, AT </p><p>LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING.  AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME, SUCH </p><p>COMMUNICATIONS ONLY JEOPRADIZE THOSE SENDING, AND THOSE RECEIVING, </p><p>THE MESSAGES TO NO PRACTICAL EFFECT.  SO LONG AS THIS EMABSSY IS </p><p>SEALED OFF TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD, WE CANNOT HELP OR BE HELPED BY </p><p>THOSE OUTSIDE.  SHOULD THERE BE GENERAL DISORDER, THEN PERHAPS THE </p><p>ACTIVE ASSISTANCE FROM AND PROTECTION BY LOCAL ELEMENTS WOULD BE </p><p>USEFUL AND PRACTICAL, BUT NOT NOW.  TO BE HONEST, AT THIS STAGE WE </p><p>ARE MORE IN NEED OF FUEL OR A COVERT POWER LINE INTO THE EMBASSY </p><p>COMPOUND THAN ANYTHING ELSE. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HOWELL </p><p></p></div>
