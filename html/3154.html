<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ABUJA 001807 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT PASS TO USTR FOR WHITAKER AND COLEMAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2012 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, PGOV, EINV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  2002 BUDGET DEBATE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>REF: ABUJA 1194 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary and background.  The Financial Year 2002 </p><p>Budget entered the political spotlight last week as President </p><p>Obasanjo met legislators and the Nigerian Federal Executive </p><p>Council debated the subject.  Obasanjo\'s original budget for </p><p>USD $7.10 billion (848 billion Naira) went to the legislature </p><p>last November. The National Assembly nearly doubled capital </p><p>expenditures, passing a budget totaling USD $8.83 billion </p><p>(1.06 trillion Naira) this March.  In April, the Supreme </p><p>Court decision on the allocation of oil revenue pronounced </p><p>many of the revenue allocation mechanisms unconstitutional. </p><p>In response to the Supreme Court decision on revenues, the </p><p>GON set up two special committees: one to handle technical </p><p>changes mandated by the decision; and a second to reach a </p><p>political compromise to alleviate losses that oil-producing </p><p>states will experience with their loss of 13% of off-shore </p><p>oil revenues.  Technical fixes are taking longer than </p><p>expected and the latter committee is reportedly deadlocked </p><p>because states without oil and other elements in the GON do </p><p>not want to restore the losses to the oil-producing in this </p><p>zero-sum exercise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary continued.  On the expenditure side, Obasanjo </p><p>has maintained a steady public campaign of refusing to spend </p><p>all of the monies budgeted by the National Assembly.  For </p><p>their part, legislators protest the executive\'s </p><p>"unconstitutional" refusal to execute the budget.  A motion </p><p>to impeach Obasanjo has been filed in the Senate.  In the </p><p>meantime, as contractors curtail operation, politicians </p><p>within Obasanjo\'s own government want to open the spigot, </p><p>particularly from the capital projects budget. They have </p><p>formed a committee within the Federal Executive Council (GON </p><p>Cabinet equivalent) purportedly to pressure the president to </p><p>spend more.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>The FEC Budget Review Panel </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) The 2002 budget was the subject of discussion at the </p><p>weekly FEC on June 5.  The group set up seven-person Budget </p><p>Review Panel headed by the Minister of State for Finance, </p><p>Jubril Martins-Kuye.  Ostensibly, the panel would review </p><p>shortfalls in revenue earnings that might affect budget </p><p>implementation.  The GON has been disappointed by the lack of </p><p>privatization of government parastatals like the Nigerian </p><p>Telecommunications Limited (NITEL) and the National Electric </p><p>Power Authority (NEPA), where the GON had budgeted receipts </p><p>of USD 1.7 billion.  With the NITEL sale going sour and NEPA </p><p>not ready to be placed on the auction block, the actual </p><p>revenue will be a far cry from the budget projection. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Other less charitable sources claim the Ministers are </p><p>frustrated by the impasse with the legislature because they </p><p>have been unable to spend as much as they would like, </p><p>particularly during this election year.  GON and donor </p><p>sources estimate FY02 Naira 100 billion is available for </p><p>capital projects but remains unspent, with Naira 25 billion </p><p>still for projects from 2001.  While some ministries have </p><p>projects waiting for funding, others appear so frustrated by </p><p>the time consuming process of gaining due process approval, a </p><p>warrant from the Accountant General of the Federation (AGF), </p><p>and finally confirmation from the Central Bank that funds are </p><p>available in their account that they have been unable to </p><p>spend the money that is waiting there for them.  As reported </p><p>Ref (A), this new process helps to reduce the manner of and </p><p>spending on questionable capital projects.  It has the </p><p>additional effect of slowing down the pace expenditures.  A </p><p>moderate reduction in velocity of spending or capital project </p><p>may have a salutary effect, but too much of a slowdown </p><p>encourages perception of inefficiency, may cause a reduction </p><p>in social services and economic activity, thus engendering a </p><p>degree of political anxiety. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p>Let Us Find A Common Ground -- Sounds Good </p><p>------------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) On June 4, President Obasanjo held a meeting with the </p><p>leadership of the National Assembly to resolve differences on </p><p>the 2002 budget.  President Obasanjo explained to the </p><p>legislators that inadequate revenue made implementing the </p><p>budget impossible.  Obasanjo asked both parties to prioritize </p><p>the budget, dropping some items that could be agreed upon </p><p>mutually. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (U)  Media reports the leadership of the National </p><p>Assembly and President Obasanjo were not able to agree on </p><p>these priority areas.  While President Obasanjo wanted to </p><p>focus on Energy and Water Resources, the legislators insisted </p><p>on Agriculture and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). </p><p>Though both parties were unable to agree on areas of </p><p>priority, they agreed to continue meeting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Sources within the GON contend the legislators are </p><p>less interested in increasing spending on federal capital </p><p>projects than in winning control of special constituency </p><p>funds for each member to spend in his or her district.  Such </p><p>funds -- or a variation of them -- have been proposed by the </p><p>legislature continually since the National Assembly first </p><p>began meeting in the summer of 1999.  As in the past, the </p><p>President reportedly opposed this fund. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p>Implement As Agreed - or else? </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C)  On June 6, several disgruntled senators proposed </p><p>formal investigation of budget implementation from May 29, </p><p>1999 to the present.  Senator Idris Abubakar said that the </p><p>Senate would first ascertain whether the constitutional </p><p>budget process has been violated, and whether or not </p><p>President Obasanjo could be impeached because of such </p><p>violations.  Hearings on the motion have been fixed for </p><p>Wednesday, June 12. (Comment: This is the latest of many </p><p>impeachment "scares" Obasanjo has had to face during his </p><p>tenure.  Most likely this will fail like the others. </p><p>However, a new development this time around is the apparent </p><p>support Senate President Anyim has lent the proceedings. </p><p>Anyim, who has been a staunch Obasanjo loyalist is apparently </p><p>bitter that Obasanjo is not fully supporting Anyim,s bid to </p><p>run for governor (Ebonyi) of his home state in 2003, instead </p><p>Obasanjo seems to be backing the incumbent. End comment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) No experienced political practitioner or observer </p><p>expects the 2002 budget to be implemented as passed by the </p><p>National Assembly.  As in years past, the actual expenditure </p><p>will most likely reflect the President,s aims.  At the same </p><p>time, most observers are surprised by how parsimonious the </p><p>president has been, having expected him to loosen the purse </p><p>strings more than he has to date. (We are hearing that </p><p>government contracts are drying up and construction firms </p><p>whose livelihood is government projects are preparing to </p><p>lay-off workers and downsize.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (C) Last week\'s public and private debates on the budget </p><p>was the first such discussion since the Supreme Court </p><p>Resource Allocation Decision in April.   The results confirm </p><p>the previous balance of power regarding implementation of the </p><p>budget.  President Obasanjo is in the driver seat and the </p><p>National Assembly is the loquacious back seater.  For the </p><p>time being, Obasanjo has decided to hold tight the reins of </p><p>spending, for commendable as well as baser political reasons. </p><p> Capital projects show less expenditure compared to this time </p><p>last year, while the unexpectedly high price of oil has </p><p>brought in more funds.  Thus, the short-term outlook for </p><p>containing inflation and stabilizing expenditures has </p><p>improved.  However, pressure to spend will be unrelenting and </p><p>there always exists the possibility that Obasanjo will give </p><p>in when he believes the time is right politically.  End </p><p>Comment. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
