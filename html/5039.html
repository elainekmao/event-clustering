(C) Concern and frustration with Zimbabwe\'s worsening </p><p>economic and other crises are mounting among senior ZANU-PF </p><p>officials, many of whom blame Robert Mugabe.  No one appears </p><p>willing or able to nudge the Zimbabwean President into </p><p>retirement, however.  Internal discussions of succession </p><p>scenarios focus predominantly on how to preserve the ruling </p><p>party\'s hold on power in a post-Mugabe era, and none that we </p><p>know of envision a voluntary retirement by Mugabe prior to </p><p>2005, or reconciliation and cooperation with the opposition </p><p>MDC.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>DISSENSION WITHIN ZANU-PF </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) In a January 8 conversation with ruling party </p><p>politburo member Solomon Mujuru, the Ambassador asked about </p><p>recent public allegations by opposition leader Morgan </p><p>Tsvangirai that armed forces chief Vitalis Zvinavashe was </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>working with the British and South African governments on a </p><p>plan to replace Mugabe with Speaker of Parliament Emmerson </p><p>Mnangagwa.  Mujuru said he doubted that Zvinavashe would have </p><p>done anything more than informally sound out ideas with </p><p>Tsvangirai through Colonel Dyck, and that Mugabe certainly </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>would not have made proposals for succession without first </p><p>vetting it through the appropriate ZANU-PF channels.  Mujuru, </p><p>who is close to the armed forces and opposed to Mnangagwa\'s </p><p>ambitions, declined to comment on Mnangagwa\'s future role. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) Asked to predict how the political situation would </p><p>unfold, Mujuru surmised that parliamentary elections in 2005 </p><p>would likely go ahead as scheduled.  He was confident that </p><p>ZANU-PF would regain a two-thirds majority, then move to </p><p>change the constitution to allow the President to appoint a </p><p>successor who would serve out the remainder of his mandate </p><p>(the constitution currently provides that an election must be </p><p>held within 90 days of the presidency being vacated.). </p><p>Shortly thereafter, Mujuru thought Mugabe would appoint a new </p><p>vice-president or two, then step down.  If the constitution </p><p>were not amended, Mujuru believed Mugabe would step down </p><p>anyway and would allow the required election to proceed </p><p>within 90 days.  Even if Morgan Tsvangirai and the opposition </p><p>MDC won, Mujuru pointed out,  they would likely have to work </p><p>with a ZANU-PF majority in Parliament.  Mujuru acknowledged </p><p>that further economic deterioration would be inevitable in </p><p>the two years until then and that risks of a political </p><p>explosion were growing, but he appeared stymied by Mugabe\'s </p><p>own objections to addressing the political crisis at this </p><p>time. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) In a separate meeting, senior ZANU-PF parliamentarian </p><p>and elder party statesman Eddison Zvobgo confirmed to us the </p><p>existence of a group of dissatisfied party cadres, comprising </p><p>both young and more longstanding members, including himself, </p><p>that is trying to distance itself from Mugabe. Zvobgo implied </p><p>that their goal is forcing Mugabe out, but they have not </p><p>devised any plan to accomplish this and their uncertainty </p><p>about the sort of political dispensation that would obtain </p><p>after Mugabe\'s departure is giving many of them pause.  In </p><p>any case, Zvobgo plans a trip soon to Atlanta, Chicago, and </p><p>New York to raise funds for this dissident group, presumably </p><p>to give them some flexibility and financial heft. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) ZANU-PF deputy political commissar Sikhanyiso Ndlovu </p><p>confirmed to polchief on January 2 that resentment with </p><p>Mugabe\'s leadership is growing among politburo members, </p><p>including himself.  He said he was increasingly concerned </p><p>about Zimbabwe\'s economic implosion and its impact on the </p><p>educational institutes he owns around the country, and he did </p><p>not want his reputation tarred by some of the GOZ\'s decisions </p><p>and policies.  At the same time, Ndlovu said a new election </p><p>was out of the question, and he dismissed the MDC as a </p><p>British puppet organization.  Many of his politburo </p><p>colleagues, he continued, simply want Mugabe out of office, </p><p>but they have not contemplated who or what might follow him. </p><p>Ndlovu claimed that strong U.S. criticism of Mugabe makes the </p><p>Zimbabwean leader more determined to hold on to power, as </p><p>Mugabe is afraid that we would press for his prosecution if </p><p>he leaves office.  Ndlovu asked whether the USG would be </p><p>willing to fund creation of something like a prestigious </p><p>educational foundation and support Mugabe to head it, if such </p><p>an arrangement might convince the Old Man to step down. </p><p>Polchief was noncommittal. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>Reconciliation Talks </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>6. (C) With the Ambassador, Mujuru repeated the common ruling </p><p>party refrain that Zimbabwe\'s disagreements with the United </p><p>Kingdom were at the root of this country\'s problems, and that </p><p>normalization of that relationship would make the internal </p><p>political crisis easier to resolve.  The Ambassador replied </p><p>that he could not speak for the British, but emphasized that </p><p>it would not be possible to come to an understanding with the </p><p>United States unless Zimbabwe\'s political crisis and the </p><p>other crises which flowed from it were addressed in a way </p><p>acceptable to most Zimbabweans. </p><p>7. (C) Asked whether resumption of the dialogue between </p><p>ZANU-PF and the MDC was possible, Mujuru noted the high level </p><p>of distrust between the parties and parroted the party line </p><p>that dialogue would be difficult so long as the MDC continues </p><p>to pursue its court challenge of the presidential election </p><p>results.  In addition, convincing Mugabe to resign, the MDC\'s </p><p>publicly stated precondition for any political solution, </p><p>would be "the hardest part." </p><p> </p><p>----------------- </p><p>Food distribution </p><p>----------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  The Ambassador commented to Mujuru that ZANU-PF has </p><p>believed that controlling distribution of scarce food </p><p>supplies is a huge political advantage, but he noted </p><p>increased infighting within the party over access to -- and </p><p>authority to distribute -- those supplies.  A strong GOZ move </p><p>to facilitate food distributions on an impartial basis would </p><p>make a favorable impression with the international community </p><p>and could help restore trust within Zimbabwe.  Some steps, </p><p>the Ambassador suggested, might include allowing private </p><p>sector food imports, inviting the United Nations to monitor </p><p>Grain Marketing Board distributions, and involving the MDC in </p><p>monitoring food distributions.  Mujuru was noncommittal. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>9. (C) An increasing number of ruling party insiders are </p><p>beginning to acknowledge the depths of Zimbabwe\'s political </p><p>and economic crises and are increasingly convinced that </p><p>Mugabe\'s departure is the solution.  Recognizing the </p><p>existence of a problem is, of course, the first step to </p><p>resolving it.  It is clear, however, that the growing </p><p>frustration among those party cadres appears motivated not by </p><p>a genuine concern for the welfare of their once prosperous </p><p>country but, rather, by the deleterious impact on their </p><p>continued access to the gravy train.  Our sense is that those </p><p>around Mugabe are scrambling to figure out a way to get rid </p><p>of the Old Man without jeopardizing ZANU-PF\'s maintenance of </p><p>power.  None of the discussions of which we are aware have </p><p>focused on the need for political reconciliation and </p><p>cooperation with the MDC. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
