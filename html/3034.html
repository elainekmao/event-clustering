ON MAY 23, UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP) </p><p>RESIDENT COORDINATOR (RESREP) J. VICTOR ANGELO HOSTED AN </p><p>"INFORMAL" MEETING WITH SENIOR-LEVEL GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE </p><p>(GOZ) OFFICIALS, REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST RESIDENT MISSIONS </p><p>OF THE ORGANIZATION OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT </p><p>(OECD), AND SELECTED REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE SOUTHERN </p><p>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) AND G-77 COUNTRIES TO </p><p>DISCUSS POLICY CONSTRAINTS PREVENTING AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE </p><p>TO ZIMBABWE\'S SERIOUS FOOD CRISIS.  ALTHOUGH THREE GOZ </p><p>MINISTERS WERE INVITED TO THE MEETING, ONLY FINANCE AND </p><p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (MOF) MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI SHOWED UP. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. FOLLOWING A BRIEF INTRODUCTION BY RESREP ANGELO, MINISTER </p><p>MAKONI PROCEEDED TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY REPORT OF THE CURRENT </p><p>COUNTRY SITUATION AND THE PLANNED GOZ RESPONSE.  A </p><p>"DIALOGUE" ON POLICY ISSUES RELATED TO THE CRISIS AND </p><p>RESPONSE FOLLOWED.  WHILE MINISTER MAKONI MADE A VALIANT </p><p>STAB AT DEFENDING OFTEN INDEFENSIBLE GOZ POLICIES, THE </p><p>MEETING UNDERSCORED PAST AND PRESENT GOVERNMENT PROBLEMS IN </p><p>WORKING WITH DONOR COUNTRIES.  MAKONI\'S GOOD INTENTIONS </p><p>ASIDE, THE MEETING PROVIDED LITTLE REASSURANCE THAT THERE IS </p><p>SUFFICIENT GOZ POLITICAL WILL TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS ISSUES </p><p>SURROUNDING FOOD SECURITY IN A TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. </p><p>SEPARATE, FOLLOWING CONVERSTIONS WITH RESREP ANGELO PROVIDED </p><p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON HOW THE UN HOPES TO KEEP THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE ON TRACK.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>------------- </p><p>INTRODUCTION </p><p>------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. OF THE THREE MINISTERES INIVTED BY UNDP RESREP J. VICTOR </p><p>ANGELO TO THE "INFORMAL" MAY 23 MEETING ON FOOD IDSSUES ONLY </p><p>MOF MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI SHOWED UP.  PERMANENT SECRETARY </p><p>(PMS) MUSEKA OF THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SERVICE, LABOR AND </p><p>SOCIAL WELFARE (M/SW) REPRESENTED MINSITER JULY MOYO; AND </p><p>MINISTER OF STATE SECURITY, NICHOLAS GOCHE, INVITED IN HIS </p><p>CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE MAIZE IMPORT TASK FORCE, FAILED </p><p>TO SHOW UP DESPITE ANGELO\'S EXPECTATION THAT HE WOULD BE </p><p>THERE.  GOCHE\'S ASSISTANT DID ARRIVE MID-MEETING TO SILENTLY </p><p>REPRESENT HIS MINISTER\'S INTERESTS, IN THE LATTER\'S ABSENCE. </p><p>END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>GOZ SITUATION UPDATE </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. FOLLOWING AN INTRODUCTION BY RESREP ANGELO, WHO STRESSED </p><p>THE CLOSED NATURE OF THE MEETING TO PROMOTE "FRANK" </p><p>DISCUSSION, MINISTER MAKONI THANKED THE DONOR COUNTRIES </p><p>PRESENT FOR ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO DATE IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.  NOTING THAT THIS WAS THE </p><p>THIRD SUCH MEETING ON THIS SUBJECT SINCE THE LAUNCH OF THE </p><p>U.N.\'S HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE RELIEF PROGRAMME (HARP) FOR </p><p>ZIMBABWE IN DECMEBER 2001 (REFTEL B) THE MINISTER PROCEEDED </p><p>TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY REPORT OF THE CURRENT COUNTRY SITUATION </p><p>AND THE GOZ RESPONSE. HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>A. TO DATE, THE GOZ HAS APPROVED A TOTAL OF 400,000 METRIC </p><p>TONS (MT) OF MAIZE IMPORTS, OF WHICH APPRXIMATELY 240,000 MT </p><p>HAS BEEN PURCHASED, WITH SOME 200,000 MT PROCURED FROM SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE SHORTAGES HAVE IMPEDED THE </p><p>COMPLETION OF THESE PROCUREMENTS, WITH MINISTER MAKONI </p><p>NOTING THAT "WE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND THE FUNDS" FOR THE </p><p>REMAINDER OF THESE COMMERCIAL PURCHASES. </p><p> </p><p>B. APPROXIMATELY 140,000 MT (OF 240,000 MT) OF MAIZE </p><p>PROCUREMENTS HAVE ARRIVED IN COUNTRY TO DATE, WITH </p><p>DELIVERIES SUFFERING SERIOUS DELAYS DUE TO "BOTTLENECKS" </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE FOOD IMPORT AND DISTRIBUTION TRANSPORT CHAIN, </p><p>E.G., INSUFFICIENT RAIL CAPACITY, AND INSUFFICIENT DOMESTIC </p><p>TRUCK TRANSPORT RESOURCES, BOTH FROM THE BORDER TO GRAIN </p><p>MARKETING BOARD (GMB) DEPOTS AND FROM THE DEPOTS TO THE </p><p>FINAL DISTRIBUTION SITES.  MAKONI SAID THAT THERE WAS "TALK </p><p>ABOUT" MOBILIZING ADDITIONAL PRIVATE TRANSPORT CAPCITY TO </p><p>OVERCOME THESE CONSTRAINTS. </p><p> </p><p>C. THE NATIONAL CROP FORECASTING COMMITTEE ESTIMATED 600,000 </p><p>MT OF MAIZE PRODUCTION THIS YEAR, LEAVING A 1.2 MILLION MT </p><p>DEFICIT (FOR PROJECTED HUMAN CONSUMPTION).  HE NOTED, </p><p>HOWEVER, GOVERNMENT CONCERNS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THIS </p><p>ESTIMATE, SINCE "THE SYSTEM" HAD NOT YET ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT </p><p>FOR THE CHANGED AGRICULTURAL SITUATION, ESPECIALLY MAIZE </p><p>PRODUCTION ON THE NEWLY RESETTLED "FAST-TRACK" LANDS.  HE </p><p>ALSO NOTED THAT FINAL FIGURES WERE EXPECTED BY END-MONTH. </p><p>NOTE:  FEWSNET HAS ALREADY PROVIDED A FINAL FIGURE FOR TOTAL </p><p>MAIZE PRODUCTION OF 500,000 MT -- 100,000 MT LESS THAN </p><p>MINISTER MAKONI\'S ESTIMATE, WHICH WAS BASED ON THE CROP </p><p>ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED TWO MONTHS AGO.  THE JOINT FOOD AND </p><p>AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION AND WORLD FOOD PROGRAM FOOD AND </p><p>CROP ASSESSMENT MISSION (REFTEL A) CONCLUDED EARLIER THIS </p><p>MONTH SUPPORTES THE FEWSNET FIGURE. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>D. THE MINISTER PROCEEDED TO OUTLINE CURRENT GOZ PLANS FOR </p><p>ADDRESSING THIS SITUATION THROUGH AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM </p><p>TARGETING 7.8 MILLION ZIMBABWEANS FOR FOOD ASSISTANCE OVER </p><p>18 MONTHS.  THE MAJOR PROGRAM COMPONENTS WOULD INCLUDE CASH- </p><p>FOR-WORK (Z$1,500/HOUSEHOLD/MONTH) FOR THE ABLE-BODIED, </p><p>TARGETED FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED, </p><p>AND SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN UNDER FIVE </p><p>YEARS OF AGE (TWO KILOGRAMS (KG.) OF "NUTRIMEAL" FOR EACH </p><p>CHILD PER MONTH) AND THREE KG/CHILD/MONTH FOR SOME OF THE </p><p>MOST NEEDY CHILDREN UNDER NINE YEARS OF AGE. </p><p> </p><p>E. STATING THAT FOOD IMPORT REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS PROGRAM </p><p>WOULD COST Z$31 BILLION OVER 12 MONTHS FROM THE BEGINNING OF </p><p>THIS CALENDAR YEAR (DECEMBER 2001), MAKONI NOTED THAT ONLY </p><p>Z$20.7 BILLION WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS </p><p>CALENDAR YEAR (TO DECEMBER 2002), ALLOWING FOR THE </p><p>FUNDS/TIME WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR SINCE </p><p>JANUARY.  NOTE:  THESE FIGURES ARE MUCH LOWER THAN THOSE </p><p>FROM AN APRIL GOZ DRAFT STRATEGY PAPER, WHICH PROJECTED </p><p>Z$102 BILLION FOR FOOD REQUIREMENTS OVER 18 MONTHS. END </p><p>NOTE.  THE MINISTER ADDED THAT THE GOZ WAS REVIEWING HOW TO </p><p>FIT THESE REQUIREMENTS INTO THE CURRENT YEAR\'S BUDGET. </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGING THAT INTERNATIONAL DONOR SUPPORT WOULD BE </p><p>REQUIRED, HE GAVE THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION THAT THE MAJORITY </p><p>COULD BE MET FROM THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET, IN COMBINATION WITH </p><p>THIS YEAR\'S HARVEST.  HE CONCLUDED THAT NEXT YEAR\'S FOOD </p><p>REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE INCLUDED IN NEXT YEAR\'S BUDGET </p><p>(OCTOBER/NOVEMBER, AND WOULD DEPEND ON THE FINAL CROP </p><p>PRODUCTION ESTIMATE, NEXT YEAR\'S RAINFALL, AND OTHER SALIENT </p><p>FACTORS. </p><p> </p><p>5. PMS MUSEKA FOLLOWED MINISTER MAKONI, BRIEFLY ELABORATING </p><p>ON THE CURRENT SERIOUS CONSTRAINTS THE PROGRAM WAS FACING, </p><p>SUCH AS THE "ACUTE TRANSPORT PROBLEM" (INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY </p><p>AND/OR FUNDS TO HIRE TRUCKS), STAFFING CONSTRAINTS (BOTH FOR </p><p>FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS AND CASH-FOR-WORK PROGRAMS), FUNDING </p><p>CONSTRAINTS (LIMITING THE "POPULAR" CASH-FOR-WORK PROGRAM, </p><p>AND NOTING SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS HAD </p><p>NOT BEEN PAID FOR COMPLETED WORK).  MUSEKA ALSO NOTED THE </p><p>INADEQUACY OF OLD AND UNRELIABLE CENSUS DATA, WHICH MADE </p><p>PROGRAM DESIGN AND TARGETING DIFFICULT.  THE PERMSEC ALSO </p><p>NOTED THE GROWING PROBLEM OF DISPLACED FARM WORKERS BECAUSE </p><p>OF THE ON-GOING FAST-TRACK LAND REDISTRIBUTION EXERCISE. </p><p> </p><p>------------------ </p><p>"POLICY DIALOGUE" </p><p>------------------ </p><p>6. RESREP ANGELO OPENED THE FLOOR FOR QUESTIONS.  THE </p><p>FOLLOWING ISSUES WERE RAISED: FOOD DISTRIBUTION "PROBLEMS"; </p><p>PARTISAN DISTRIBUTION OF RELIEF ASSISTANCE; THE </p><p>COMMICATIONS/DIALOGUE "GAP" BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND DONOR </p><p>COUNTRIES; PRIVATE SECTOR AND NGO PARTICIPATION IN THE </p><p>CRISIS; THE IMPACT OF PRICE CONTROLS AND THE EXCHANGE RATE </p><p>ON THE PROVISION OF FOOD RELIEF; THE IMPACT OF THE FAST- </p><p>TRACK EXERCISE ON THE CURRENT FOOD/AGRICULTURAL SITUATION; </p><p>CLARIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY FOOD SITUATION; FOOD </p><p>TRADE/SALES/MARKETING RESTRICTIONS; (COMMERCIAL) FARMING </p><p>ASSURANCES/SECURITY; PRICE CONTROLS; THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE </p><p>REGIME; AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE IMPORT AND DISTRIBUTION OF </p><p>FOOD COMMODITIES CONTAINING GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS </p><p>(GMO).  THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT 10,00 MT OF </p><p>AMERICAN MAIZE WERE DIVERTED TO OTHER SOUTH AFRICAN </p><p>COUNTRIES BECAUSE OF ZIMBABWE\'S FAILURE TO WAIVE GMO </p><p>RESTRICTIONS.  HE STATED THAT CONTINUATION OF GMO </p><p>RESTRICTIONS WOULD SEVERLY LIMIT USG ABILITY TO HELP. </p><p> </p><p>7. MAKONI RESPONDED BY DENYING KNOWLEDGE OF A COMMUNICATION </p><p>GAP, CITING PAST INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP MEETINGS ON THIS </p><p>SUBJECT, AND ASSURING DONORS OF HIS CONTINUING WILLINGNESS </p><p>TO MEET AT ANY TIME TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES NOTED ABOVE WITH </p><p>DONOR COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES. </p><p> </p><p>8. ON THE ISSUE OF POLITICAL DISCRIMINATION IN FOOD/RELIEF </p><p>PROGRAMS, THE MINISTER STATED THAT HE HAD HEARD ALLEGATIONS </p><p>BUT WAS UNAWARE OF ANY ACTUAL INCIDENTS OF SUCH ABUSE.  HE </p><p>SAID THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION (NAMES, NUMBERS, LOCATIONS, </p><p>ETC.) WOULB BE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM; GENERAL </p><p>ALLEGATIONS WERE NOT USEFUL.  HE STRESSED THAT LOCAL NGOS, </p><p>TRADITIONAL LEADERS, AND OTHERS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROGRAM </p><p>IMPLEMENTATION HAD NOT REPORTED SUCH INCIDENTS IN RESPONSE </p><p>TO HIS OWN HOME-DISTRICT QUERIES ON THE ALLEGATIONS.  THIS </p><p>INFORMATION LED HIM TO QUESTION THE EXTENT OF THIS PROBLEM - </p><p>- HE UNDERSCORED THAT THIS TYPE OF ABUSE IS NOT SOMETHING </p><p>THAT HAPPENS IN ZIMBABWEAN SOCIETY, IN THAT IT IS CULTURALLY </p><p>UNACCEPTABLE (A SINGULARLY CURIOUS STATEMENT, FROM OUR POINT </p><p>OF VIEW).  HOWEVER, HE WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT ANY PROBLEM SO </p><p>THAT IT COULD BE PROMPTLY.  PMS MUSEKA SECONDED MAKONI\'S </p><p>STATEMENTS, REITERATING THAT IT WAS THE COMMUNITIES </p><p>THEMSELVES THAT MADE BENEFICIARY DECISIONS AND IMPLEMENTED </p><p>THE PROGRAM.  HE ADDED THAT HIS MINISTRY HAD RECEIVED NO </p><p>REPORTS OF SUCH ABUSE TO DATE AND, THEREFORE, HE WAS </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT "THE SYSTEM IS WORKING WELL." </p><p> </p><p>9.  THE MINISTER SUGGESTED THAT THE CONSTRAINTS ON PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR ACCESS AND INVOLVEMENT WERE MORE ARTIFICIAL THAN </p><p>ACTUAL, CITING SEVERAL POSITIVE STEPS IN THIS AREA.  THESE </p><p>INCLUDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PRIVATE SECTOR TRUST FUND BY </p><p>LOCAL BUSINESSES TO ASSIST THE RELIEF EFFORT, AND THE </p><p>REMOVAL OF ANY DUTY ON GRAIN IMPORTS (INCLUDING 25 PERCENT </p><p>DUTY FOR NON-SADC IMPORTS).  HE ADDED THAT THE STATUTORY </p><p>INSTRUMENT BANNING PRIVATE SECTOR IMPORTS/SALES OF BASIC </p><p>CEREALS WAS, IN REALITY, BEING IGNORED, CITING NUMEROUS </p><p>INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES WHERE IMPORT PERMITS HAD BEEN GRANTED </p><p>TO PRIVATE SECTOR SUPPLIERS.  HE STATED HIS WILLINGNESS TO </p><p>CONTINUE TO DEAL FAVORABLY WITH SUCH PRIVATE SECTOR REQUESTS </p><p>"PRACTICALLY", ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, AS OPPOSED TO </p><p>GETTING BOGGED DOWN IN POLITICS BY ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE </p><p>FORMAL LEGISLATION OR POLICY ON THIS SUBJECT (WHICH IS </p><p>CLEARLY BEYOND HIS POWER TO DO).  PRESSED, MAKONI </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS PRIVATE SECTOR RELIEF APPLIED ONLY TO </p><p>PRIVATE SECTOR IMPORTS FOR DONATIONS TO THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES </p><p>AND HAD NO RELEVANCE TO PRIVATE SECTOR IMPORTS FOR MARKET </p><p>SALES, WHICH WERE IMPRACTICAL, GIVEN THE LOW FIXED PRICE FOR </p><p>MAIZE MEAL. </p><p> </p><p>10. ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, MAKONI LARGELY REITERATED </p><p>WHAT WE ALL ALREADY KNEW - WHILE HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO </p><p>ADDRESS IT, THIS WAS A DIFFICULT POLITICAL ISSUE WHICH WAS </p><p>BEYOND HIS POWER ALONE TO CORRECT.  WHILE HE REMAINED </p><p>OPTIMISTIC, NO RESOLUTION HAD YET BEEN CONCLUDED ON THIS </p><p>ISSUE.  THE MINISTER ALSO NOTED HIS CONCERNS REGARDING THE </p><p>MEDIA\'S TREATMENT OF THESE ISSUES AS ONLY SERVING TO </p><p>EXACERBATE PROBLEMS AND MAKE HIS ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THEM </p><p>MORE DIFFICULT. </p><p> </p><p>11. ON THE ISSUE OF PRICE CONTROLS, THE MINISTER REITERATED </p><p>THE SAME GENERAL LINE.  CITING SEVERAL RECENT INSTANCES </p><p>WHERE PRICES ON BASIC GOODS AND SERVICES HAD BEEN ADJUSTED, </p><p>HE ENCOURAGED REPORTING/PRESENTATION OF COMMODITY-SPECIFIC </p><p>INSTANCES OF PROBLEMS THAT COULD BE DEALT WITH ON A CASE-BY- </p><p>CASE BASIS (AS OPPOSED TO FORMALLY CHANGING THE RELEVANT </p><p>LAWS OR POLICIES ON THIS SUBJECT).  HE EXPRESSED HIS </p><p>WILLINGNESS TO ATTMEPT TO DEAL WITH ANY SUCH SPECIFIC </p><p>INSTANCES AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>12. MAIKONI ACKNOWLEDGED A "DOWNSIDE TO MAJOR AGRARIAN </p><p>REFORM" - THE FAST TRACK PROGRAM -- IN ZIMBABWE OVER THE </p><p>PAST SEVERAL YEARS.  HE CONCEDED THAT DISTURBANCES ON FARMS </p><p>RESULTING FROM FAST TRACK WERE AT LEAST PARTLY RESPONSIBLE </p><p>FOR THE CURRENT FOOD CRISIS.  NOTING THAT THE LAND </p><p>REDISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WAS NOW ALMOST COMPLETE, HE URGED </p><p>ASSISTANCE TO ALL FARMERS -- INCLUDING FAST-TRACK RESETTLERS </p><p>-- TO STIMULATE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.  HE FURTHER URGED </p><p>THE DONORS TO "FORGET ABOUT HOW/WHY WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE", </p><p>THAT "WE MUST WORK WITHIN THE CURRENT REALITY," THAT THERE </p><p>WAS NO BENEFIT TO BE DERIVED FROM "RE-HASHING OLD ISSUES", </p><p>AND THAT WE SHOULD, THEREFORE, "GET ON WITH WHAT\'S LEFT." </p><p> </p><p>13. ON FARMER SECURITY/ASSURANCES, THE MINISTER NOTED THAT </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT WAS ENCOURAGING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN </p><p>RESPONSE TO THE GROWING FOOD CRISIS.  HE CHARACTERIZED THE </p><p>CURRENT FARMING SITUATION AS "IN TRANSITION", WITH </p><p>GOVERNMENT NOW TRYING TO "REGULARIZE" FAST TRACK AND THUS </p><p>ENSURE FARM/ER SECURITY.  HE STATED HIS BELIEF THAT THE </p><p>SECURITY SITUATION ON COMMERCIAL FARMS HAD IMPROVED OVER THE </p><p>PAST FIVE WEEKS; BUT ALSO THAT FOR A PROGRAM OF THIS </p><p>MAGNITUDE, SUCH ACTIONS TAKE TIME. </p><p> </p><p>14. HE ACKNOWLEDGED HAVING HEARD OF THE GMO ISSUE BUT </p><p>EXPRESSED IGNORANCE ABOUT THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICS.  HE </p><p>PLANNED TO CONVENE A MEETING WITH THE BIO-SAFETY BOARD (THE </p><p>ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR GOVERNMENT POLICY ON GMOS) IN AN </p><p>ATTEMPT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE.  HE SUGGESTED THAT </p><p>ONE POSSIBLE CONCERN WAS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON BEEF </p><p>EXPORTS TO CERTAIN TRADING PARTNERS (THE EUROPEAN UNION) </p><p>FROM GMO-FED LIVESTOCK.  NOTE: MISSION/WFP HAS INFORMATION </p><p>THAT STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT GMO-FED LIVESTOCK IS NOT A </p><p>SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR THE EU/EC.  END NOTE.  THE MINISTER </p><p>EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN THIS </p><p>ISSUE TO COORDINATE.  WHILE ADMITTING THE GOZ\'S ATTENTION TO </p><p>THIS ISSUE CAME LATE, HE CONCLUDED WITH "BETTER LATE THAN </p><p>NEVER." </p><p> </p><p>15. AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN\'S REQUESTED CLARIFICATION ON THE </p><p>CURRENT FOOD SITUATION -- INITIALLY, MINISTER MAKONI </p><p>APPEARED TO SUGGEST THAT THE NATION\'S FOOD NEEDS FOR THE </p><p>REMAINDER OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR COULD ADEQUATELY BE MET FROM </p><p>GOVERNMENT IMPORTS AND THIS YEAR\'S HARVEST (STRONGLY </p><p>IMPLYING THAT NO INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE REQUIRED, </p><p>AT LEAST OVER THIS PERIOD).  HOWEVER, IN RESPONSE TO </p><p>SPECIFIC FOLLOW-UP QUERIES ON THIS SUBJECT BY THE BRITISH </p><p>HIGH COMMISSIONER, THE MINISTER RETRACTED THIS POSITION, </p><p>STATING, "OF COURSE WE WILL NEED INTERNATIONAL/EXTERNAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE."  HE HAD APPARENTLY DOUBTED-COUNTED PURCHASES </p><p>MADE THIS YEAR, THEREBY MAXIMIZING GOZ RESOURCES. </p><p>ADDITIONAL ATTEMPTS TO CLARIFY THE FIGURES SPAWNED </p><p>CONFUSION, WITH THE MINISTER FINALLY STATING THAT HE WOULD </p><p>NEED TO "REVIEW THE FIGURES", AND THAT HE WOULD GET BACK TO </p><p>THE AUDIENCE WITH THE CORRECT POSITION ON THIS SUBJECT AS </p><p>SOON AS POSSIBLE. </p><p> </p><p>16. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEETING, THE MALAWIAN HIGH </p><p>COMMISSIONER TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOTE THE GREATER </p><p>REGIONAL NATURE OF THE PROBLEM.  SHE HIGHLIGHTED HER OWN </p><p>COUNTRY\'S DESPERATE SITUATION, CITING ONE PRESS REPORT </p><p>INDICATING THAT ONE IN FIVE MALAWIANS WERE UNDER SEVERE </p><p>THREAT OF DYING FROM STARVATION.  SHE EXPRESSED HER </p><p>COUNTRY\'S GRATITUDE FOR DONOR ASSISTANCE PLEDGED/PROVIDED TO </p><p>DATE, AND ENDORSED THIS TYPE OF CONSULTATIVE EXCHANGE AS THE </p><p>ONLY WAY TO PROPERLY ADDRESS A SERIOUS CRISIS OF THIS SCOPE </p><p>AND MAGNITUDE. </p><p> </p><p>17. AT A PRIVATE LUNCH IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MEETING, </p><p>UNDP RESREP ANGELO ELABORATED ON A FEW OF MAKONI\'S REMARKS </p><p>AND TOOK ABOARD A FEW SUGGESTIONS FROM THE AMBASSADOR ON </p><p>POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS.  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CONVERSATION </p><p>INCLUDED: </p><p> </p><p>-- THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR </p><p>THE UN TO ORGANIZE FIELD VISITS BY DIPLOMATS AND </p><p>INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS TO FOOD DISTRIBUTION SITES, BOTH </p><p>TO PUBLICIZE THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND TO DISCOURAGE ANY </p><p>TEMPTATION FOR ANYONE TO MANIPULATE FOOD DISTRIBUTION FOR </p><p>POLITICAL ENDS.  ANGELO AGREED THAT DIPLOMATIC VISIST WERE </p><p>DESIRABLE BUT OPINED THAT JOURNALISTS WOULD BE MORE </p><p>COMFORTABLE FENDING FOR THEMSELVES.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED </p><p>THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THE MEDIA BE ALLOWED TO VIEW THE </p><p>SITUATION CLOSE UP. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT THE PRESENCE OF INDEPENDENT </p><p>MONITORS OF WFP FOOD AID WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT GOZ PARANOIA </p><p>AND TAKE A BURDEN OFF THE UN.  HE SAID THAT HE WAS CERTAIN </p><p>THAT DONOR SUPPORT FOR SUCH AN EFFORT WOULD BE FORTHCOMING. </p><p>ANGELO ACCEPTED THAT SGS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING </p><p>ORGANIZATIONS WOULD BE WELL PLACED TO TACKLE SUCH AN </p><p>ASSIGNMENT. </p><p> </p><p>-- THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE </p><p>RELIEF EFFORT DEPENDED UPON STRAIGHTFORWARD PRESENTATION OF </p><p>THE FACTS, INCLUDING THE CAUSES OF THE PROBLEM.  IT WOULD BE </p><p>NECESSARY TO PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FLAWED GOZ POLICIES, </p><p>AND NOT JUST DROUGHT, HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRISIS.  ANGELO </p><p>AGREED. </p><p> </p><p>-- ANGELO SAID THAT THE GOZ HAS FINALLY TAKEN THE LID OFF </p><p>THE PLIGHT OF FARM WORKERS.  A UNDP TEAM IS CURRENTLY IN THE </p><p>FIELD ATTEMPTING TO TAKE THE MEASURE OF THIS VERY </p><p>COMPLICATED SITUATION.  HE HOPED TO HAVE A CLEARER PICTURE </p><p>OF NUMBERS, LOCATIONS, AND NEEDS SOON. </p><p> </p><p>-- ANGELO SAID THAT THE UNSYG HAD MET WITH MUGABE TWICE </p><p>DURING MUGABE\'S RECENT VISIT TO NEW YORK.  THE FIRST MEETING </p><p>FOCUSSED ON TECHNICAL/HUMANITARIAN ISSUES, WITH MUGABE </p><p>APPEARING LARGELY BLANK ON THE DIMENSIONS OF THE FOOD CRISIS </p><p>DESPITE THE FACT THAT NIGERIAN MEDIATOR ADEDEJI HAD GIVEN </p><p>HIM A PAPER (DRAFTED BY ANGELO) DESCRIBING THE SITUATION. </p><p>MUGABE PAID LIP SERVICE TO RETURNING TO ABUJA, BUT LITTLE </p><p>ELSE.  THE SECOND MEETING FOCUSED ON THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE </p><p>AND WAS SINGULARLY UNPRODUCTIVE.  MUGABE FEIGNED SURPRISE </p><p>THAT THE INTER-PARTY TALKS, WHICH HE TERMED AS "TECHNICAL," </p><p>HAD COLLAPSED AND SAID THAT THIS INITIATIVE WAS THE CONCERN </p><p>OF HIS SUBORDINATES AND THAT HE WAS NOT INVOLVED. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>18. MAKONI MADE HIS USUAL VALIANT EFFORT TO DEFEND OFTEN </p><p>INDEFENSIBLE GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND ACTIONS VIS A VIS THE </p><p>HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.  HOWEVER, THE MEETING MOSTLY </p><p>UNDERSCORED PAST AND PRESENT GOVERNMENT PROBLEMS IN WORKING </p><p>WITH DONOR COUNTRIES INVOLVED.  THE RECURRING PROBLEMS OF </p><p>RELATIVE PRIORITIES, INTERMINISTERIAL ACCOUNTABILITY, AND </p><p>POLITICAL INTRANSIGENCE ALL MANIFESTED THEMSELVES IN VARIOUS </p><p>STAGES OF THE PROCEEDINGS.  MAKONI HAS NEVER BEEN THE </p><p>PROBLEM, NOR THROUGH ANY FAULT OF HIS OWN THE FIX, BUT </p><p>DESPITE HIS BEST INTENTIONS THE OUTCOME OF THE MEETING WAS </p><p>LESS THAN SATISFACTORY.  INDIVIDUAL CASE-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS </p><p>WILL SIMPLY NOT SUFFICE IN ADDRESSING A CRISIS OF THIS </p><p>MAGNITUDE, DEMANDS SERIOUS POLICY REFORM ARE REQUIRED.  THE </p><p>FINANCE MINISTER\'S APPARENT CONFUSION OVER ACTUAL COUNTRY </p><p>NEEDS AND DONOR REQUIREMENTS WAS PARTICULARLY DISTRESSING IN </p><p>THE CONTEXT OF A NATIONAL FOOD CRISIS OF HISTORICAL </p><p>DIMENSIONS.  IT PROVIDED LITTLE REASSURANCE THAT THE </p><p>POLITICAL WILL AND WHEREWITHALL EXIST WITHIN GOVERNMENT TO </p><p>ADDRESS THESE SERIOUS POLICY CONCERNS IN A TIMELY AND </p><p>EFFECTIVE MANNER.  HIS "LET BYGONES BE BYGONES" RHETORIC, </p><p>IMPLYING THAT THE DONORS SHOULD SUFFER COLLECTIVE AMNESIA </p><p>ABOUT THE ABUSIVE GOZ LAND GRAB PRESENTLY ONGOING, AND GET </p><p>ON WITH FORKING OVER TO THE GOZ WHAT IT THINKS IT NEEDS TO </p><p>REBUILD THE COUNTRY ANEW IN ITS OWN ZANU-PF IMAGE, MERITS NO </p><p>FURTHER COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
