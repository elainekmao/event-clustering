<p>UNCLAS GUATEMALA 001805 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PINR, PREL, MOPS, PHUM, KDEM, GT </p><p>SUBJECT: CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECLARES RIOS MONTT ELIGIBLE </p><p>TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. GUATEMALA 1774 </p><p> </p><p>     B. GUATEMALA 1760 </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) By a vote of 4 to 3, the Constitutional Court issued a </p><p>decision on the evening of July 14 striking down the earlier </p><p>findings of the Registry of Persons, the Supreme Electoral </p><p>Tribunal and the Supreme Court (reftels), which had found </p><p>that former de facto President Efrain Rios Montt was not </p><p>eligible to be a candidate for President, based on Article </p><p>186 of the Constitution.  The Constitutional Court decision </p><p>goes against a 1990 decision by the Constitutional Court and </p><p>a 1995 decision by the Supreme Court (Note: In 1995 the </p><p>appeal was not raised to the Constitutional Court. End note), </p><p>which found that Article 186 of the Constitution did apply to </p><p>Rios Montt, and that he could not be a candidate. </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) The Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) must now register </p><p>Rios Montt as a candidate.  Some civil society leaders and </p><p>representatives of some opposition political parties have </p><p>called on the TSE to refuse to register Rios Montt, arguing </p><p>that they can not be compelled to carry out an instruction </p><p>that violates the law.  Others, however, have said that the </p><p>Constitution does not allow for an appeal to the </p><p>Constitutional Court\'s decision, and say that rebellion by </p><p>the TSE would only compound the damage to Guatemala\'s fragile </p><p>democratic process begun by the questionable decision of the </p><p>Constitutional Court. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Reaction to the widely anticipated decision was swift. </p><p> Rios Montt ran a paid add on TV only minutes after the </p><p>announcement of the decision in which he heralded the </p><p>Constitutional Court finding as a victory for the rule of </p><p>law, and called on FRG members to refrain from celebrating in </p><p>the streets.  Nobel Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu told </p><p>reporters that the Supreme Court decision had been a </p><p>"constitutional coup."  Private Sector leader Dionisio </p><p>Gutierrez said the Court\'s decision had wrought "irreparable </p><p>damage on Guatemala\'s democratic institutions."  GANA </p><p>presidential candidate Oscar Berger called on all Guatemalans </p><p>to defeat Rios Montt once and for all at the ballot box.  The </p><p>Ambassador used the Department\'s previously cleared press </p><p>guidance on the morning of July 15: basically, that while the </p><p>decision is final, we are perplexed by a decision that, in </p><p>the absence of new facts, runs counter to two previous </p><p>findings on the issue. </p><p> </p><p>4. (SBU) Comment: The decision, while following the </p><p>procedures outlined in the law, goes against the previous </p><p>findings of the Court and smacks of partisan manipulation. </p><p>Opponents of the FRG view the decision as the opening act of </p><p>electoral fraud in the current election campaign, and are </p><p>expressing concern that it sets a precedent for the ruling </p><p>FRG to perpetrate "further fraud" during the elections.  OAS </p><p>election observation chief Paniagua, in town on an initial </p><p>visit, told the Ambassador (when he phoned to ask that we </p><p>lobby other donors for financing) that he did not plan to </p><p>comment until he was better grounded in the situation here. </p><p>HAMILTON </p><p></p></div>
