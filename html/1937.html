<p>UNCLAS ABUJA 002224 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR INL/AAE--PRAHAR AND FLOOD AND FOR AF/W-BOOTH </p><p>DOJ FOR OIA-JASON CARTER </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KCRM, SNAR, PGOV, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: PLANNING A USG-GON EXTRADITION EXCHANGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is an action message:  Action request for INL/AAE in </p><p>para 5. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. Several discussions with Nigeria\'s Attorney General and </p><p>his staff over the past three months have produced agreement </p><p>on the terms of an extradition exchange or consultations to </p><p>be funded by INL and implemented by DOJ\'s Office of </p><p>Prosecutorial Development and Training (OPDAT) program. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. The consultations by visiting DOJ/OPDAT prosecutors, will </p><p>involve 10-15 Nigerian public prosecutors and up to five high </p><p>court judges in a frank and open discussion of the US and </p><p>Nigerian processes in handling extradition requests.  The </p><p>main goal of this activity is to identify obstacles to </p><p>effecient extraditions in Nigerian law and procedures and </p><p>either correct these or find ways to mitigate them.  Also </p><p>attending will be a few special advisors to the Attorney </p><p>General and, Mission hopes, the recently retired director of </p><p>Public Prosecutions, Mrs. Malouku, who has extensive </p><p>experience in handling past USG extradition requests.  The </p><p>Attorney General\'s office agrees with our desired priority in </p><p>selecting public prosecutors who have prior experience in </p><p>extradition cases. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. The Attorney General has explicitly pledged to form a </p><p>prosecutorial extradition unit from the pool of public </p><p>prosecutors participating in this exchange.   This unit would </p><p>consist of four or five prosecutors dedicated to handling </p><p>extradition cases.  Once a new Chief Judge is named to head </p><p>the Federal High Court, the Attorney General will seek his </p><p>cooperation in designating one High Court judge to handle </p><p>extradition cases exclusively. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. Post has proposed, and the Attorney General\'s office </p><p>endorses, a mid-October timeframe for the four or five day </p><p>exchange in Abuja.  Post\'s RNLEO would assist OPDAT with the </p><p>selection of a suitable site for these consultations as well </p><p>as all necessary logistical arrangements.  The AG\'s office </p><p>has not asked for any per diem for participating MOJ </p><p>prosecutors or High Court judges, though we anticipate </p><p>funding per diem for Mrs. Malouku and a few participating </p><p>prosecutors who work in High Court venues outside of Abuja </p><p>(e.g. Lagos and Kaduna). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. Action Request for INL/AAE:  Please coordinate a formal </p><p>response with DOJ\'s Office of International Affairs (POC: </p><p>Jason Carter, 616-3073) indicating OPDAT and DOJ prosecutors\' </p><p>availability to travel to Abuja for a week in mid-October. </p><p>This activity will draw on existing and unused FY2000 INL </p><p>funds ($75,000) already obligated to OPDAT for extradition </p><p>training. </p><p>Andrews </p><p></p></div>
