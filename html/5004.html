<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 ABU DHABI 000112 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/ARP (LMALENAS), NEA/P (ACASPER), NEA/PPD </p><p>(JDAVIES, CBOURGEOIS), INR </p><p>SECDEF FOR OASD/PA </p><p>USCINCCENT FOR POLAD </p><p>LONDON FOR GOLDRICH; PARIS FOR O\'FRIEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: OIIP, KMDR, TC </p><p>SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  DEMOCRACY AND WOMEN\'S PARTICIPATION IN </p><p>UAE POLITICS MEPI IRAQ NORTH KOREA AFGHANISTAN </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  SUMMARY:  DEMOCRACY AND THE PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN </p><p>POLITICAL LIFE WERE THE DOMINANT ISSUES IN THE UAE MEDIA.  WHILE </p><p>NOTING THE UAE PEOPLE ARE ENTHUSIASTIC AND INTERESTED IN </p><p>DEMOCRACY, UAE COLUMINST MOHAMMED AL HAMADI ARGUED IN "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" THAT THERE IS A NEED TO LEARN DEMOCRACY BEFORE </p><p>PRACTICING IT.  AS FURTHER SUPPORT, A RECENT POLL BY THE "AL </p><p>KHALEEJ" SHOWED 83% OF NATIONALS SUPPORT INCREASED PARTICIPATION </p><p>FOR WOMEN IN UAE POLITICAL LIFE, AND 96% AGREE ON THE ENTRY OF </p><p>WOMEN IN THE LABOR MARKET. </p><p> </p><p>2.  AT THE SAME TIME, IN AN "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL, NAEEM QADAH </p><p>DESCRIBED MEPI AS A CONSPIRACY TO ACHIEVE ISRAELI AMBITIONS. </p><p>COMPARING THE MOVE TOWARDS WAR WITH IRAQ WHILE NEGOTIATING WITH </p><p>NORTH KOREA, AN "AL BAYAN" EDITORAL ASKED THE U.S. TO DEAL WITH </p><p>IRAQ LIKE NORTH KOREA AND DEMONSTRATE JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS IN ITS </p><p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.  FINALLY, IN A GULF NEWS FEATURE ARTICLE </p><p>ENTITLED "HELPING AFGHAN WOMEN," KAVITHA DANIEL REVIEWS THE </p><p>EFFORTS OF WOMEN FOR WOMEN, AN AMERICAN VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION, </p><p>TO HELP AFGHAN WOMEN FIND A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES DESPITE </p><p>THE LACK OF INTERNATIONAL FUNDING FOR RECONSTRUCTION.  END </p><p>SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  REFERRING TO DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON MEPI, UAE COLUMNIST </p><p>MOHAMMED AL HAMADI WROTE IN ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-OFFICIAL "AL </p><p>ITTIHAD" ON 1/8: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE UAE PEOPLE ARE ENTHUSIASTIC AND INTERESTED IN DEMOCRACY, </p><p>THE SAME AS OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ... I BELIEVE THERE IS A </p><p>BIG GAP BETWEEN THE PRACTICE OF DEMOCRACY ON THE GROUND AND THE </p><p>DESIRE TO DO SO.  IN THE UAE AND OTHER GULF COUNTRIES, APPLYING </p><p>DEMOCRACY SUDDENLY AND IMMEDIATELY IS NOT THE CORRECT CHOICE. </p><p>BESIDES, IT IS A DANGEROUS STEP, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS NOT THE </p><p>REAL DESIRE OF THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE AT THE MOMENT, THOUGH THERE </p><p>ARE MANY WHO INSIST IT IS.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN PEOPLE DO NOT WANT </p><p>DEMOCRACY, BUT BECAUSE MANY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT." </p><p> </p><p>4.  SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" PUBLISHED THE RESULTS OF </p><p>A POLL BY ITS STUDIES UNIT ON THE PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN </p><p>POLITICAL LIFE ON 1/8.  THE POLL SURVEYED 700 NATIONALS AND </p><p>SHOWED 83% AGREE ON THE PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN POLITICS: </p><p> </p><p>"... 7 OUT OF 10 NATIONALS BELIEVE TRADITIONS AND CUSTOMS ARE THE </p><p>BIGGEST OBSTACLES TO WOMEN FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE NATIONAL COUNCIL </p><p>OR A MINISTERIAL POSITION ... 20% OF NATIONALS BELIEVE THERE IS </p><p>DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN ... THE UAE SOCIETY TODAY IS </p><p>MORE WILLING TO ACCEPT THE EXPANSION OF THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN </p><p>POLITICAL LIFE; ONE-THIRD OF NATIONALS BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT </p><p>WOMEN MUST TAKE A LEADING POLITICAL POSITION WHERE AS HALF OF </p><p>NATIONALS BELIEVE WOMEN MUST HAVE A PRESENCE IN POLITICS ... 68% </p><p>OF NATIONALS AGREE ON WOMEN TAKING A MINISTERIAL POSITION ... 81% </p><p>OF NATIONALS SUPPORT THE MEMBERSHIP OF WOMEN IN THE NATIONAL </p><p>COUNCIL.  59% ALSO AGREE ON WOMEN TAKING A LEADING POSITION IN </p><p>DIPLOMACY ... 65% OF NATIONALS DO NOT AGREE ON WOMEN BEING </p><p>JUDGES, 28% AGREE AND 13% STRONGLY AGREE ... THE ENTIRE UAE </p><p>POPULATION AGREES WOMEN SHOULD JOIN THE LABOR MARKET WITH ONLY A </p><p>MINOR EXCEPTION.  53% STRONGLY AGREE ON WOMEN\'S WORK, 43% AGREE </p><p>IN PRINCIPLE, AND ONLY 4% DISAGREE, I.E., 96% OF NATIONALS AGREE </p><p>ON THIS ISSUE ... THE ENTRY OF WOMEN INTO THE LABOR MARKET IS ONE </p><p>OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SOLUTIONS TO THE CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC </p><p>IMBALANCE.  IT WILL REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE HIGH RATE </p><p>OF FOREIGN LABOUR IN VITAL AND SENSITIVE SECTORS OF THE NATIONAL </p><p>ECONOMY." </p><p> </p><p>5.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "THE U.S. INITIATIVE IS A CONSPIRACY TO </p><p>ACHIEVE ZIONIST AMBITIONS," NAEEM QADAH WROTE IN "AL KHALEEJ" ON </p><p>1/7: </p><p> </p><p>"... THE WORLD DOES NOT HATE THE U.S.  IT HATES CONTRADICTION, </p><p>DOUBLE STANDARDS, AND AN IMMORAL BIAS ... LINKING POWELL\'S </p><p>PROJECT OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS IN THE ARAB WORLD WITH </p><p>REFURBISHING THE U.S. IMAGE IN THE REGION MEANS THE SUCCESS OF </p><p>THE PROJECT IS LINKED WITH A BETTER IMAGE.  FACTS INDICATE THIS </p><p>IS IMPOSSIBLE AS LONG AS U.S. POLICY IN THE REGION IS SUBJECT TO </p><p>ISRAELI POLICY ... ALL EVIDENCES AND INDICATIONS FROM WASHINGTON </p><p>IMPLY THE U.S. WILL NEVER CONSIDER ANY SUGGESTION OR COMMENT </p><p>AFFECTING ISRAELI INTERESTS.  IF THE U.S. IS REALLY KEEN ON </p><p>PROMOTING REAL DEMOCRACY, IT WILL WORK TO REMOVE OBSTACLES TO </p><p>PEACE ... ONE QUESTION MUST BE ADDRESSED BY COLIN POWELL:  WHO </p><p>WILL BE CONVINCED OF WHAT YOU SAY, SECRETARY, WHEN THEY SEE THE </p><p>DAILY ORGANIZED KILLING OF PALESTINIAN CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND </p><p>ELDERS DURING THEIR SLEEP, OR WHEN THEY SEE THE U.S. AND U.K. </p><p>MILITARY BUILD-UP PLANNING TO CONSUME IRAQI OIL AND RE-OCCUPY THE </p><p>REGION IN 19TH-CENTURY STYLE?" </p><p> </p><p>6.  COMMENTING ON U.S. DOUBLE STANDARDS TOWARDS NORTH KOREA AND </p><p>IRAQ, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED ON </p><p>1/8: </p><p> </p><p>"... NOBODY WANTS THE AMERICANS TO TREAT NORTH KOREANS IN THE </p><p>SAME HORRIBLE MANNER THEY DO IN IRAQ.  WE ASK AMERICANS TO TREAT </p><p>IRAQIS IN RECIPROCAL WAY (LIKE NORTH KOREA).  THIS IS THE MINIMUM </p><p>AMOUNT OF JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS WE CAN ASK FOR INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RELATIONS..." </p><p> </p><p>7.  ASSESSING THE SUCCESS OF AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN, A SPECIAL FEATURE ENTITLED </p><p>"HELPING AFGHAN WOMEN" BY KAVITHA DANIEL IN THE ENGLISH DAILY </p><p>GULF NEWS COVERS THE WORK OF WOMEN FOR WOMEN, AN AMERICAN </p><p>VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION, TO TRAIN AFGHAN WOMEN TOWARDS SELF- </p><p>SUSTAINABILITY WHILE COMMENTING ON THE LACK OF IMPROVEMENT IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  EXCERPTS INCLUDE: </p><p> </p><p>"...IN ITS INTERACTION WITH THE 1,200 WOMEN RECRUITED OFF THE </p><p>STREETS OF KABUL, THE GROUP FOUND THESE ILLITERATE, UNSKILLED, </p><p>AND SOMETIMES DISPLACED, WOMEN WILLING TO BE TRAINED FOR ANY </p><p>ACTIVITY TO EARN MONEY, SAYS (LINA) ABIRAFEH (COUNTRY DIRECTOR OF </p><p>WOMEN FOR WOMEN), WHO IS IN THE UAE TO MEET DONORS AND </p><p>PHILANTHROPISTS TO RAISE AWARENESS AND FUNDS..." </p><p> </p><p>"...ACCORDING TO HER (ABIRAFEH), DESPITE A YEAR OF </p><p>RECONSTRUCTION, THERE ARE NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT IN </p><p>AFGHANISTAN.  INCREASED RATES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN HOUSEHOLDS </p><p>HAS BEEN A FALLOUT OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS..." </p><p> </p><p>"A HOST OF OTHER WOMEN\'S ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALSO WORKING TO </p><p>IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS, BUT LACK OF FUNDS HAS FORCED THEM TO WORK </p><p>FROM PROJECT TO PROJECT, SAYS ABIRAFEH." </p><p> </p><p>WAHBA </p><p></p></div>
