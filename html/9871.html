<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 08 FRANKFURT 006409 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR HADDA </p><p>TREASURY FOR OASIA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EUN </p><p>SUBJECT: Stability and Growth Pact: Listerine Syndrome; </p><p>Striving to Do Good, Good Enough? Key Word - </p><p>Flexibility </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>T-IA-F-03-0040 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  1.   Summary:  "The taste people hate, twice a day." </p><p>     Wretchedly-tasking Listerine\'s old advertising slogan </p><p>     is akin to the criticism of the EU Stability and Growth </p><p>     Pact (SGP): we don\'t like these rules, but we need </p><p>     rules at least twice a year when budget results are </p><p>     issued.  When Europe was growing, budgets were not </p><p>     under strain.  The rules were tolerable.  Slow growth </p><p>     has changed all that.  Calls for the SGP to be </p><p>     suspended or modified, however, are likely to go </p><p>     unheeded.  Where does that leave this debate? </p><p> </p><p>  2.   One way to approach the debate would be to </p><p>     distinguish between the "letter" of the SGP and its </p><p>     "spirit."  The letter of the Pact is popularly </p><p>     distilled into one number, the reference value that </p><p>     deficits exceeding 3% of GDP are "excessive."  If an </p><p>     excessive deficit were not corrected in the year after </p><p>     which it was identified, the member state concerned </p><p>     could be subject to sanctions.  The spirit of the Pact </p><p>     essentially is that governments should work hard to </p><p>     avoid any excessive deficit and, once it occurs, work </p><p>     hard to get it back under control.  Economies and </p><p>     budgets, being less than clock-work like in their </p><p>     predictability, often incur surprises or "exceptional" </p><p>     or "special circumstances." Bad things happen. </p><p> </p><p>  3.   At this writing, the outlook seems rather clear </p><p>     that Portugal, Germany and France will not abide by </p><p>     Ecofin\'s recommendations to bring their budgets under </p><p>     3% value (for Germany and France in 2004) or keep them </p><p>     there (Portugal in 2003).  Sanctions, however, are not </p><p>     automatic.  Instead, a question EU Finance Ministers </p><p>     will collectively decide is whether the member state </p><p>     concerned is failing to take necessary corrective </p><p>     action. This, necessarily, is a political as well as an </p><p>     economic question. </p><p> </p><p>  4.   Flexibility is the word of the day in the SGP </p><p>     debate.  Flexibility exists in the rules.  Exercising </p><p>     this flexibility responsibility will be a challenge for </p><p>     the European Commission and Ecofin.  Being flexible by </p><p>     ignoring the rules is one thing.  Being flexible by </p><p>     taking into account measurable efforts to get the </p><p>     structural deficit under control, including through </p><p>     structural reforms, would be quite another.  Such </p><p>     efforts could mean brighter growth and budget </p><p>     performance.  That, after all, is the point of the SGP. </p><p>     End Summary </p><p> </p><p>  SGP:  Storm and Drang Amounting to Very Little </p><p> </p><p>  5.   The SGP is getting its share of hits in the press. </p><p>     As the euro area slogs through its third year of </p><p>     sluggish economic growth, government budget deficits </p><p>     are rising.  Goldman Sachs estimates that for the euro </p><p>     area these deficits will increase from 2.2% of GDP in </p><p>     2002 to 2.7% in 2003.  Portugal, Germany and France </p><p>     have been found to have "excessive deficits," well </p><p>     above the 3% of GDP reference value of the Treaty. </p><p>     Ecofin has issued all three recommendations to reduce </p><p>     their deficits below 3% and keep them there.  Pro- </p><p>     cyclical budget policy seems counter-intuitive. </p><p>     Wouldn\'t tightening fiscal policy risk slowing an </p><p>     already crawling economy?  Calls for suspending the </p><p>     SGP, revising it, or abolishing it seem to be a steady </p><p>     diet of some financial journalists.  They are likely to </p><p>     amount to nothing. </p><p> </p><p>  SGP Rules: The Basics, Revisited </p><p> </p><p>  6.   Many economists of the euro area agree that fiscal </p><p>     rules are necessary for the European Monetary Union. </p><p>     The basic argument is to contain the "spillover" </p><p>     effects from a country with a high deficit and growing </p><p>     debt on interest rates and, consequently, on the </p><p>     financing costs of other countries in the union. </p><p>     Higher interest rates could put pressure on the </p><p>     European Central Bank (ECB) to lower rates, potentially </p><p>     conflicting with its primary objective of maintaining </p><p>     price stability.  A framework of rules to coordinate </p><p>     and discipline 12 national fiscal policies with a </p><p>     single monetary policy is designed to avoid such </p><p>     spillover effects. </p><p>  7.   Even Belgian economist Paul De Grauwe, often a </p><p>     critic of the EMU, admits that some rules are </p><p>     necessary.  Nonetheless, in his "Economics of Monetary </p><p>     Union" published in 2000 he criticized the SGP as being </p><p>     "unbalanced" imposing strict rules at the expense of </p><p>     flexibility.  He points out that during the 1991-93 </p><p>     recession six EU countries had government deficits of </p><p>     over 3% of GDP.  So why impose such a strict rule if it </p><p>     is bound to be broken? To do so risks breaking the </p><p>     rules and diminishing the value of the pact. </p><p>  8.   Such criticism is, at least to date, misplaced. </p><p>     This is the first time the excessive deficit procedures </p><p>     (EDP) have been invoked.  It is difficult to know </p><p>     beforehand how they will be applied, particularly </p><p>     during this period of prolonged economic slowdown. </p><p>     Commented a senior Finance Ministry official who </p><p>     participated in the drafting of the SGP, the authors </p><p>     did not foresee such a long period of stagnation. </p><p> </p><p>  Why 3%? </p><p> </p><p>  9.   3% of GDP reference value seems to be a bit of a </p><p>     rough rule.  Yet it does have its logic. If trend real </p><p>     economic growth were 3% (the high side of the euro </p><p>     area\'s growth potential), inflation were 2% (the </p><p>     European Central Bank\'s definition of price stability) </p><p>     this would imply nominal growth trend of 5% per year </p><p>     (which was the average nominal growth rate for the Eu- </p><p>     15 during 1991-2000).  If the stock of Euro area debt </p><p>     were 60% of GDP (which it was for the Euro area 11 </p><p>     years ago when the basic rules were being written), </p><p>     then a 3% of GDP government deficit would imply no </p><p>     increase in the debt relative to GDP.  That is, a </p><p>     steady state. </p><p> </p><p>  10.  The rough rule is even a bit rougher in reality. </p><p>     As of 2002 the Euro 12 have a debt stock of 69% of GDP. </p><p>     Nominal growth has been trending below 4%, likely to be </p><p>     closer to 3% this year.  The higher debt stock and </p><p>     lower growth imply a deficit of around 2.7% to avoid a </p><p>     further increase in debt as a share of GDP.  For </p><p>     countries with higher than average debt (Italy) and </p><p>     average or below average growth (German), surpluses </p><p>     would be in order to reach a sustainable level.  Not </p><p>     doing so can put pressure on interest rates and strain </p><p>     on monetary policy, as noted above.  No wonder small </p><p>     countries that have moved close to budget surplus </p><p>     during the cyclical upswing are displeased with the </p><p>     larger countries that did not (France, Germany) or who </p><p>     did not bring down their overall debt levels (Italy). </p><p>     France is a special case: debt level around 60% and </p><p>     growth rates around average. </p><p> </p><p>  11.  The 3% reference value also is attractive because </p><p>     it is relatively easy to explain and as transparent as </p><p>     Eurostat can make it.  More sophisticated measurements </p><p>     of cyclically adjusted numbers are used by the </p><p>     Commission to monitor trends.  These lack clarity </p><p>     (assumptions could vary) and simplicity. </p><p> </p><p>  12.  The rules are unlikely to change.  The recent </p><p>     draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe </p><p>     incorporated the SGP rules, without substantive change. </p><p>     Similarly, in its May 2003 Concluding Statement of its </p><p>     Article IV consultations on the Euro Area Policies, the </p><p>     IMF mission stated that the 3% limit "is and must </p><p>     remain one of the key references values of the monetary </p><p>     union."  "An Agenda for a Growing Europe" issued by an </p><p>     Independent High-Level Study Group chaired by Belgian </p><p>     economist Andre Sapir in July 2003, argued that the 3% </p><p>     of GDP upper limit should be kept to "steer fiscal </p><p>     discipline." Nonetheless, there is another way to </p><p>     approach the issue, namely, flexibly. </p><p> </p><p>  Need for Flexibility </p><p> </p><p>  13.  De Grauwe\'s view on flexibility has become the </p><p>     keyword of the day.  Sapir\'s High Level Study Group </p><p>     pleas for more differentiation in applying the SGP, </p><p>     taking into account a country\'s debt level, and for </p><p>     more flexibility in the case of severe cyclical </p><p>     downturns.  For the latter, the High Level Study Group </p><p>     recommended changing the definition of the term </p><p>     "exceptional circumstances" to be defined as simply a </p><p>     negative annual growth rate rather than a 2 percent </p><p>     decline.  This would require a change in the Treaty. </p><p>     Others, such as the ECB, argue that the SGP already has </p><p>     sufficient flexibility.  Which is correct? </p><p> </p><p>  Rules of the Game:  Economists As Wanna-be Lawyers </p><p> </p><p>  14.  To understand the debate, familiarity with the </p><p>     rules of the game is helpful.  This can be a chore. </p><p>     The SGP is not one tidy document, but is composed of </p><p>     Treaty Articles and Protocols and Council Regulations </p><p>     and Resolutions.  Article 104(2) of the Treaty states </p><p>     that the Commission is to monitor member states\' </p><p>     budgetary situation and whether they comply with the 3% </p><p>     reference value unless the excess over 3% is declining </p><p>     close toward 3% or is "only exceptional and temporary." </p><p>     Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 </p><p>     ("the Council Regulation") defines "exceptional and </p><p>     temporary" as resulting from an unusual event outside </p><p>     the control of the member state concerned and which has </p><p>     a major impact on the financial position of the general </p><p>     government or when resulting from a severe economic </p><p>     downturn.  A severe economic downturn is exceptional </p><p>     only if there is an annual fall of real GDP of at least </p><p>     2%, according to Article 2(2). </p><p> </p><p>  15.  Article 2(3) refines the point by allowing the </p><p>     Commission to examine "other supporting evidence" that </p><p>     would suggest an exceptional circumstance, even if the </p><p>     decline is less than 2%.  Such evidence includes the </p><p>     abruptness of the downturn or the accumulated loss of </p><p>     output relative to past trends.  The Resolution of the </p><p>     European Council on the SGP ("the Council Resolution") </p><p>     further commits member states not to invoke the </p><p>     benefits of Article 2(3) unless they are in a "severe </p><p>     recession," further defined as an annual fall in real </p><p>     GDP of at least 0.75%. </p><p> </p><p>  16.  For Portugal, Germany and France, the Commission </p><p>     considered whether exceptional circumstances were at </p><p>     play and, at the time it was preparing its report, </p><p>     decided in the negative.  Thus, it issued a report that </p><p>     these countries\' deficits were excessive.  Ecofin </p><p>     agreed and issued recommendations to each of these </p><p>     countries to "bring the situation to an end."  As </p><p>     provided for under the Council Regulation, Ecofin gave </p><p>     the Member country concerned four months to take </p><p>     effective action.  Article 3(4) of the Council </p><p>     Regulation states that the deadline for the correction </p><p>     of the excessive deficit "should be completed in the </p><p>     year following its identification unless there are </p><p>     special circumstances."  Under the Council Resolution, </p><p>     member states have committed themselves to this action. </p><p>     The phrase "special circumstances" is not defined </p><p>     either in the Council Regulation or Council Resolution. </p><p> </p><p>  17.  What happens if the deficit is not corrected? </p><p>     Article 104(9) of the Treaty states that: "If a Member </p><p>     State persists in failing to put into practice the </p><p>     recommendations of the Council, the Council may decide </p><p>     to give notice to the Member State to take, within a </p><p>     specified time-limit, measures for the deficit </p><p>     reduction which is judged necessary by the Council in </p><p>     order to remedy the situation."  If the Member State is </p><p>     not implementing the recommendations or the measures </p><p>     are inadequate, Ecofin is to take action, on the basis </p><p>     of a recommendation from the Commission, either under </p><p>     Article 104(9), that is give a (or another) notice or </p><p>     under Article 104(11), resort to sanctions.  Or if the </p><p>     excessive deficit has not been corrected within the </p><p>     time limits specified either in the initial EDP or a </p><p>     notice issued under 104(9), Ecofin can again issue </p><p>     another notice under 104(9) or move to sanctions. </p><p> </p><p>  18.  Sanctions can be invoked "as long as a Member </p><p>     State fails to comply with a decision taken in </p><p>     accordance with" 104(9).  Thus, a Member State would </p><p>     have to "fail to put into practice the recommendations" </p><p>     of Ecofin and would have to fail to comply with </p><p>     recommendations in any follow-up notice.  In short, be </p><p>     incorrigible. </p><p>  Sanctions:  Deterrent or Admission of Failure? </p><p> </p><p>  19.  For the record, sanctions themselves are also a </p><p>     drawn out affair.  When Ecofin takes a decision under </p><p>     104(11) a non-interest-bearing deposit is to be </p><p>     required.  This would consist of a 0.2% of GDP fixed </p><p>     component and a variable component of one-tenth of the </p><p>     difference between the deficit as a percentage of GDP </p><p>     and the 3% reference value.  The total deposit cannot </p><p>     exceed 0.5% of GDP. </p><p> </p><p>  20.  The deposit is converted into a fine if two years </p><p>     after the deposit was required the excessive deficit </p><p>     had not been corrected. A German Finance Ministry </p><p>     official admitted that just how the fine would be </p><p>     imposed has not been thought through.  "You see, when </p><p>     we drafted these provisions, they were not meant to be </p><p>     used, but to serve as a deterrent. " </p><p> </p><p>  21.  Article 104(11) includes other possible measures: </p><p>     require the member state concerned to publish </p><p>     additional information before issuing bonds and </p><p>     securities or invite the European Investment Bank to </p><p>     reconsider its lending policy to the Member State </p><p>     concerned. </p><p> </p><p>  Now we turn to the application of the rules to the </p><p>  "live cases" of Portugal, Germany and France. </p><p> </p><p>  Portugal: Brightness Before the Burn Out? </p><p> </p><p>  22.  In November 2002, Ecofin decided that Portugal\'s </p><p>     2001 deficit of 4.1% was excessive.  The Council\'s </p><p>     recommendation called for (a) putting an end to the </p><p>     excessive deficit as rapidly as possible (i.e. the year </p><p>     following its identification, 2002); (b) implementing </p><p>     budget plans for 2002 that would bring the deficit down </p><p>     to 2.8%; and (c) implementing necessary measures to </p><p>     ensure the 2003 budget is below 3%. </p><p> </p><p>  23.  The GOP went through hell and high water to meet </p><p>     (a) and (b).  In the event, the deficit came in at </p><p>     2.8%.  In March 2003, however, the Council did not </p><p>     "abrogate" their excessive deficit decision.  Rather, </p><p>     they wanted to assess the sustainability of the deficit </p><p>     remaining below 3%.  According to Commission officials, </p><p>     prospects are not good. </p><p> </p><p>  24.  Portugal\'s economy is contracting and the deficit </p><p>     may well shoot up to 5% of GDP, according to Commission </p><p>     experts. UBS Warburg suggests part of the contraction </p><p>     was due to budget consolidation, between 0.7% to 1.3%. </p><p>     In September Eurostat will give its assessment of the </p><p>     budget outlook for 2003.  The Commission is likely to </p><p>     make an assessment either in September or shortly after </p><p>     the final 2003 budget numbers are published in March </p><p>     2004.  The Commission is likely to make a report with </p><p>     recommendations to Ecofin. </p><p> </p><p>  25.  How might this case be handled by the Commission </p><p>     and Ecofin?  Under the "letter" of the rules, the </p><p>     Commission is considering whether, in fact, there are </p><p>     "special circumstances" given the decline in GDP.  As </p><p>     noted above, the phrase "special circumstances" under </p><p>     the Council Regulation regarding the correction of the </p><p>     deficit (Article 3(4)) is not defined. This contrasts </p><p>     with the phrase "exceptional" under Article 2(3) of the </p><p>     Council Regulation when the Commission makes its </p><p>     initial assessment of whether a deficit is excessive. </p><p> </p><p>  26.  With regard to the "spirit" of the rules, the GOP </p><p>     probably can make a good case that they have complied </p><p>     as much as possible with the Ecofin recommendations. </p><p>     They pushed the deficit below 3% in 2002, as </p><p>     recommended, and are committed to achieve a sustainable </p><p>     deficit under the 3% reference value.  Ecofin noted </p><p>     that the GOP is moving to improve the collection and </p><p>     processing of government data, reinforce mechanisms to </p><p>     coordinate budgetary policy, and implement policies to </p><p>     foster growth, employment and competitiveness. </p><p>     Whatever the Commission and Ecofin do on Portugal will </p><p>     set a precedent for the German and French cases to </p><p>     follow. </p><p>  Germany:  Miss America on Your Arm or Egg in Your </p><p>  Face </p><p> </p><p>  27.  In January 2003 Ecofin determined that Germany had </p><p>     an excessive deficit.  They recommended that the German </p><p>     government (a) put an end to the excessive deficit as </p><p>     rapidly as possible in accordance with Council </p><p>     Regulation Article 3(4) (i.e. the year after the </p><p>     deficit was identified, 2004); and (b) implement their </p><p>     budget plans for 2003 which, on the basis of German GDP </p><p>     growth projections of 1.5% in 2003, aim at reducing the </p><p>     deficit in 2003 to 2.75% of GDP by adopting budgetary </p><p>     measures of 1% of GDP.   Ecofin "noted" the commitment </p><p>     of German authorities to implement structural reforms </p><p>     and to reduce the underlying budgetary deficit by more </p><p>     that 0.5% of GDP per year, with the exception of 2005 </p><p>     due to the introduction of income tax reforms. </p><p> </p><p>  28.  The German government\'s budget plan for 2003 </p><p>     achieves a budget deficit reduction of almost 1%, in </p><p>     structural terms, at least on paper.  This plan passed </p><p>     muster in the four month review of German budget </p><p>     performance in May.  However, the decline in growth, </p><p>     probably close to zero this year, will help push the </p><p>     deficit close to 4% in 2003.  Under the "letter" of the </p><p>     rules, the deficit need not be corrected until 2004. </p><p> </p><p>  29.  Unfortunately, 2004 doesn\'t look much better. </p><p>     Germany has announced that it will bring forward the </p><p>     income tax cut scheduled for 2005 to January 2004, and </p><p>     implement income tax cuts that had been postponed from </p><p>     January 2003.  Combined this would amount to a revenue </p><p>     loss of around 1.3% of GDP,  only part of which would </p><p>     be financed through reduced expenditures.  Goldman </p><p>     Sachs estimates that the deficit will linger around 4%. </p><p> </p><p>  30.  The German Finance Ministry differs.  It hopes </p><p>     that income tax cuts combined with structural reforms </p><p>     and structural budget consolidation through subsidy </p><p>     reductions will give a boost to economic growth to </p><p>     around the Finance Ministry\'s assumption of 2%.  This </p><p>     should help push the deficit toward the 3% level. </p><p> </p><p>  31.  This strategy is risky, in the view of a senior </p><p>     ECB official.  The income tax cuts may be pocketed by </p><p>     politicians without making the important structural </p><p>     reforms and subsidy cuts.  Finance Ministry officials </p><p>     admit that there are risks.  It is a package deal - no </p><p>     structural reforms or subsidy cuts - then no income tax </p><p>     cuts in 2004.  Success would be a "great step forward." </p><p>     Failure would be "catastrophic," in the words of a </p><p>     senior Finance Ministry official.  Miss America on your </p><p>     arm or egg on your face. </p><p> </p><p>  32.  Under the SGP rules, German Finance Ministry </p><p>     officials say they will argue "letter" and "spirit." </p><p>     Like the case of the Portuguese, they will argue that </p><p>     not realizing their assumed growth projections and the </p><p>     prolonged economic stagnation are  "special </p><p>     circumstances" that have prevented correction of the </p><p>     deficit by 2004.  As noted above, this phrase is </p><p>     undefined.  German Finance Ministry officials hope the </p><p>     Commission will exercise some discretion.  German </p><p>     Finance Ministry officials explain that they will keep </p><p>     to the commitment of an average annual reduction of its </p><p>     structural deficit of 0.5%, with a pause in 2004, due </p><p>     to the income tax cuts, rather than in 2005 when these </p><p>     cuts were originally scheduled to be implemented. </p><p> </p><p>  33.  With respect to "spirit," Ministry officials say </p><p>     they will point out that the government followed </p><p>     Ecofin\'s recommendation to stick to their 2003 </p><p>     reduction plan, e.g. reduction of the structural </p><p>     deficit by nearly 1%.  Rather than boosting confidence, </p><p>     as the Commission and ECB had suggested it might, </p><p>     confidence languished.  The announced program of </p><p>     structural reforms and bringing forward the tax cuts </p><p>     has provided the sweetener to push through subsidy cuts </p><p>     envisaged in the budget consolidation program.  The </p><p>     idea of advancing the income tax cuts, they will argue, </p><p>     is to bolster confidence while keeping their </p><p>     commitments to Ecofin to cut the deficit over time and </p><p>     undertake structural reforms.  After all, getting below </p><p>     the 3% reference value depends as much on the </p><p>     denominator as the numerator, that is, on growth as </p><p>     much as the absolute size of the deficit. </p><p> </p><p>  34.  Commission officials privately are not convinced </p><p>     by the "special circumstances" arguments.  In a speech </p><p>     in Berlin on July 1 European Commissioner Solbes was </p><p>     "quite clear": "the Commission expects that Germany </p><p>     will respect the EMU policy framework.  A general </p><p>     government deficit above 3% of GDP in 2004, for the </p><p>     third year in a row, would be incompatible with our </p><p>     common budgetary rules." </p><p>  35.  At the conclusion of the Fund\'s Article IV </p><p>     Consultation with German authorities, the Fund mission </p><p>     expressed support for the strategy of packaging </p><p>     structural reforms, budget consolidation through </p><p>     reduced expenditures, and advancing income tax cuts. </p><p>     The mission conceded, however, that advancing the </p><p>     income tax cuts "will make the fiscal arithmetic for </p><p>     2004 difficult," and that getting below the 3% </p><p>     reference value will "be a challenge" in 2004.  But </p><p>     overall, the mission sensed that "the prospect for </p><p>     meaningful structural change is finally in the air. If </p><p>     proposed reforms are implemented and fiscal </p><p>     consolidation put on firmer ground, we are optimistic </p><p>     that Germany\'s economy can put a long period of weak </p><p>     performance behind it."  Testimony on behalf of </p><p>     Germany. </p><p> </p><p>  36.  The first indications of the budget for 2004 will </p><p>     be in the budget plan to be agreed by the end of this </p><p>     year in Germany.  If the budget plan has a deficit of </p><p>     3% for 2004, perhaps with the help of "aggressive </p><p>     assumptions" on growth and revenues, the first real </p><p>     evidence of actual results will appear only in </p><p>     September 2004 when Eurostat publishes its preliminary </p><p>     estimates.  Final figures for 2004 will be available </p><p>     only in March 2005.  On each of these dates, the </p><p>     Commission could launch a report with recommendations </p><p>     to Ecofin. </p><p> </p><p>  France:  Unique, naturalement </p><p> </p><p>  37.  In June Ecofin determined that France had an </p><p>     excessive deficit.  They recommended that the French </p><p>     authorities (a) put an end to the excessive deficit as </p><p>     rapidly as possible and by "2004 at the latest;" (b) </p><p>     achieve a "significantly larger improvement in the </p><p>     cyclically adjusted deficit in 2003 than currently </p><p>     planned," and (c) implement measures to ensure that the </p><p>     cumulative improvement in 2003-2004 is enough to bring </p><p>     the nominal deficit "below 3% in 2004 at the latest." </p><p>     Ecofin noted the commitment of French authorities to </p><p>     ensure tighter control of expenditures and to achieve </p><p>     pension reform. </p><p> </p><p>  38.  As reported septel, this decision was not </p><p>     supported unanimously, the Dutch and the Danes </p><p>     dissenting.  Ecofin had issued an "early warning" to </p><p>     the French in January calling for "at least 0.5 </p><p>     percentage point of GDP" improvement in its cyclically- </p><p>     adjusted budgetary position.  In March the French </p><p>     government\'s official forecast showed only a 0.1 </p><p>     percentage point improvement.  It seemed that the </p><p>     French had not taken to heart Ecofin\'s earlier </p><p>     recommendation. </p><p> </p><p>  39.  Reiterating the call for a 0.5 percentage point </p><p>     cut in June when half the budget year was over seemed </p><p>     unrealistic, according to Commission experts.  Thus, </p><p>     the formula was agreed that there should be an average </p><p>     reduction of 0.5 percentage points annually over the </p><p>     two years, 2003-2004.  This suggests a one percentage </p><p>     point cut in 2004. Moreover, Commission experts expect </p><p>     the French deficit to be close to 4% of GDP in 2003. </p><p>     Thus, a percentage point reduction in the deficit would </p><p>     be necessary in 2004 in any case.  Commission staff </p><p>     consider such a deep cut problematic.  German Finance </p><p>     officials consider it the maximum possible. </p><p> </p><p>  40.  The next step for France will come on October 3. </p><p>     Under the SGP rules, this will be the four month </p><p>     deadline by which time French authorities must explain </p><p>     the measures they will take to comply with Ecofin\'s </p><p>     recommendations.  This will be a time of testing of </p><p>     whether France is serious about respecting the SGP, at </p><p>     least on paper. </p><p> </p><p>  41.  German Finance Ministry officials, while quick to </p><p>     emphasize their wonderful working relationship with </p><p>     France, just as quickly distinguish their position on </p><p>     the SGP from France\'s.  They assert that they are </p><p>     sticking by the rules, if not the letter at least the </p><p>     spirit.  In their view, France is doing neither. </p><p> </p><p>  42.  The IMF also has supported the French Government\'s </p><p>     basic economic strategy, in particular "the structural </p><p>     orientation of policies and the intention to resume </p><p>     fiscal adjustment." In its Article IV Consultation </p><p>     Concluding Statement issued in June, the IMF mission </p><p>     praised the legislation of the "key and difficult </p><p>     milestone" of pension reform.  The Fund notes that the </p><p>     2003 deficit will be more than one percentage point </p><p>     higher than planned and supports the objective of </p><p>     reducing the underlying general government budget </p><p>     deficit by 0.5 percentage points in 2004.  Such a </p><p>     modest reduction would not be in line with Ecofin\'s </p><p>     recommendation. </p><p> </p><p>  43.  The Fund mission goes on to point out that the </p><p>     "credibility of the government\'s fiscal and economic </p><p>     policy strategy hinges crucially on its ability to </p><p>     reduce the share of public spending in GDP."  Notably, </p><p>     it points out that priority structural areas identified </p><p>     by the government for reform (pension, health care, </p><p>     reform of the state, and decentralization) will help </p><p>     reduce expenditures as a share of GDP and "illustrate </p><p>     the synergies between budgetary reform and possible </p><p>     increases in potential growth."  Here, as in the case </p><p>     of Germany and Portugal, is the connection between </p><p>     fiscal discipline, structural reforms and growth.  An </p><p>     argument that France is operating within the "spirit" </p><p>     of the SGP.  Moreover, France could argue that its past </p><p>     growth rates and debt position suggest that its deficit </p><p>     is sustainable - at least for a while - and not putting </p><p>     pressure on the euro system. </p><p> </p><p>  Growth and the SGP </p><p> </p><p>  44.  The stated objective of the SGP is "sound </p><p>     government finances as a means of strengthening the </p><p>     conditions for price stability and for strong </p><p>     sustainable growth conducive to employment creation." </p><p>     This suggests that discretionary fiscal policies should </p><p>     be avoided so as not to burden monetary policy, and </p><p>     foster low interest rates that are conducive to long- </p><p>     term planning and investment.  For most EU countries </p><p>     this means cutting expenditures to achieve a more </p><p>     sustainable level of debt or to avoid increased in debt </p><p>     in order to ensure its sustainability when increased </p><p>     expenditures become unavoidable due to aging </p><p>     populations. </p><p> </p><p>  45.  In its June 2003 report on "Public Finances in the </p><p>     EMU," the Commission notes that budgetary consolidation </p><p>     "often acts as a catalyst for structural reforms." </p><p>     Structural reforms can boost growth and growth </p><p>     potential.  As the Commission notes in that report, </p><p>     "the effect of budgetary consolidation on output could </p><p>     be reinforced, and even positive, in the short-run if </p><p>     fiscal consolidation is combined with structural reform </p><p>     of factor and product markets and accompanied with an </p><p>     accommodating monetary stance." </p><p> </p><p>  46.  So that\'s the deal for growth: budget </p><p>     consolidation, structural reform, accommodative </p><p>     monetary policy.  Interest rates are at record lows. </p><p>     Pressure has grown for structural reforms due to budget </p><p>     pressures.  It would be more than a pity to relieve </p><p>     that pressure now.   No wonder Dutch Finance Minister </p><p>     Zalm, noted for his tough stance on deficits, has </p><p>     called for fines for France and Germany if they fail to </p><p>     get their finances in order next year. </p><p> </p><p>  47.  How could flexibility be applied without </p><p>     sacrificing the rules? One point is that when Ecofin </p><p>     made its recommendations for all three countries, the </p><p>     Commission\'s and ECB\'s forecast was for much more </p><p>     robust growth than has occurred.  Thus, the rising </p><p>     deficits could be due, in part, to cyclical factors. </p><p>     In November 2002 the European Commission agreed to give </p><p>     importance to cyclically adjusted budget balances in </p><p>     its surveillance and ensure a cyclically-adjusted </p><p>     budget position of at least 0.5% of GDP and more </p><p>     emphasis on the quality of public expenditures that are </p><p>     conducive to growth and employment. </p><p> </p><p>  48.  The IMF Mission on Euro Area policies has praised </p><p>     these measures.  Specifically the Fund staff liked the </p><p>     notion that countries with excessive deficits make </p><p>     adjustments of at least 0.5% of GDP per year in </p><p>     cyclically adjusted terms and that multi-year </p><p>     consolidation plans should aim at curbing expenditures. </p><p>     The Fund staff admits, however, that these steps will </p><p>     not ensure deficits drop immediately below 3%. </p><p>     Nonetheless, they argue that those countries that </p><p>     follow these guidelines of "0.5 percent high quality </p><p>     multi-year adjustment" should be "considered on a </p><p>     sustainable path toward compliance with the Pact." </p><p>     Striving to do good should be good enough. </p><p> </p><p>  49.  Maintaining a judicious balance between enforcing </p><p>     the letter of the SGP while safeguarding the spirit </p><p>     will be the next challenge for the Commission and </p><p>     Ecofin.  No one said that coordinating 12 national </p><p>     budgets during a prolonged economic downturn would be </p><p>     easy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  50.
