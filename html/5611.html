<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 BRASILIA 000439 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR WHA/EPSC BBOWIE-WHITMAN </p><p>DEPT PLEASE PASS TO USTR FOR RSMITH, SCRONIN </p><p>USDA FOR JBPENN US/FFAS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ETRD, BR, Fee Trade Agreement of America (FTAA) </p><p>SUBJECT: BRAZIL SWAYS MERCOSUL ON FTAA OFFERS </p><p> </p><p>REF: BRASILIA 00356 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Following through on its rhetoric to strengthen and </p><p>unify Mercosul, Brazil\'s new government has acted forcefully </p><p>and decisively to forge consensus with its Mercosul partners </p><p>over FTAA initial offers.  Foreign Minister Amorim, first </p><p>securing the Argentine pledge of solidarity in Buenos Aires </p><p>on February 4 was able to bring Uruguay and Paraguay into the </p><p>fold during a February 5 Ministerial meeting in Montevideo. </p><p>A week earlier, there had been dissension in the Mercosul </p><p>ranks at Brazil\'s insistence that investment and government </p><p>procurement offers from the group be delayed beyond the </p><p>February 15 deadline (reftel). </p><p> </p><p>Where the Offers Stand </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>-- Goods </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) As previously reported (reftel), Mercosul plans to </p><p>submit by February 15 a consolidated offer as a group; the </p><p>list will cover industrial and agricultural products. A </p><p>chapeau for the offer will present some general conditions </p><p>including reference to a single-undertaking, balance between </p><p>commitments in market access with obligations in other areas, </p><p>GATT, etc.  In a February 7 discussion with econoff, Tovar da </p><p>Silva Nunes, head of Itamaraty\'s FTAA Coordinating Office </p><p>(COALCA), provided the following rough breakdown of the </p><p>Mercosul goods offer as a percentage of Mercosul-FTAA trade: </p><p> </p><p>Category A (immediate duty-free): 18 percent </p><p>Category B (tariff elimination in 5 years): 3 percent </p><p>Category C (tariff elimination 5-10 years): 18 percent </p><p>Category D (tariff elimination over 10 years): 60 percent. </p><p> </p><p>Product coverage of the offer is comprehensive (total above </p><p>is less than 100 percent due to rounding error).  NOTE: local </p><p>press reported incorrectly that the above percentages refer </p><p>to number of products.  According to Da Silva Nunes, the </p><p>number of tariff lines relating to categories A, B, and C </p><p>combined is roughly 54 percent.  END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Da Silva Nunes claimed that Brazil\'s offer had been </p><p>more ambitious before the Mercosul consolidation process. </p><p>Given the disparity in the productive structure of the </p><p>Mercosul partners, he explained that the general rule used to </p><p>produce a joint list was to adopt the most cautious position </p><p>presented by one of the Mercosul partners.  So, if three </p><p>countries had placed a product in the A category, but the </p><p>fourth had it in Category C, it was placed in Category C on </p><p>the combined list.  Apparently this process had to be applied </p><p>to over 7,000 tariff lines, he noted, not always with a </p><p>result that made sense for Brazilian business. </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) Brazil\'s decision-making body for foreign trade </p><p>issues, CAMEX, met yesterday to approve the offer.  According </p><p>to press reports, the Ministries of Fazenda and Agriculture </p><p>had wanted a more ambitious offer, but Itamaraty and the </p><p>Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade (MDIC) prevailed </p><p>with the Mercosul offer as agreed to in Montevideo. </p><p> </p><p>-- Services </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) According to Da Silva Nunes, Mercosul continues to </p><p>plan to present services offers by February 15, but that </p><p>decision is still not final since ministerial consultations </p><p>within the GOB are on-going.  In addition, the GOB is </p><p>evaluating whether recent changes in its civil code will </p><p>require slight revisions to its offer (a new civil code which </p><p>passed at the beginning of the year includes several </p><p>provisions relating to the establishment of businesses).  The </p><p>services submission will be under a Mercosul chapeau, with </p><p>separate, positive lists attached (reftel).  As Da Silva </p><p>Nunes explained, Mercosul countries have to supply separate </p><p>offers because GATS plus for one would not necessarily be </p><p>GATS plus for another. (Note: Brazil had indicated that its </p><p>offer will only apply to commitments at the central or </p><p>federal level.  Da Silva Nunes said that Paraguay has asked </p><p>Brazil to consider whether, as negotiations proceed, it would </p><p>be willing to make commitments at the sub-federal level.) </p><p> </p><p>-- Investment and Government Procurement </p><p> </p><p>6. (SBU) While no time-line for submission of investment and </p><p>government procurement offers has been decided, Da Silva </p><p>Nunes suggested that Mercosul would definitely want to submit </p><p>these offers in advance of the Trade Negotiating Committee </p><p>(TNC) meeting April 9-11.   He claimed Mercosul will want to </p><p>be in a strong position in the TNC meeting to argue for the </p><p>establishment of certain modalities and would not want its </p><p>position undermined by not having submitted offers in all of </p><p>the market access areas. </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Da Silva Nunes stressed that these are initial offers </p><p>and that once offers are on the table, Mercosul will evaluate </p><p>whether or not it has to quickly improve its offers to be </p><p>compatible with what others have presented. </p><p> </p><p>Public Access to Information on Offers </p><p> </p><p>8. (SBU) Econoff inquired as to GOB plans regarding public </p><p>dissemination of information contained in FTAA offers.  Da </p><p>Silva Nunes said no decision has been made yet.  He said that </p><p>the GOB will probably release all the details of its own </p><p>offers.  He noted that it would be helpful to know what other </p><p>FTAA partners are planning or would prefer in terms of </p><p>treatment of their offers.  He believed the GOB would act </p><p>according to the wishes of each of its FTAA partners. </p><p>HRINAK </p><p></p></div>
