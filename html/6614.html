<p>UNCLAS HARARE 000584 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR AF/S, DRL </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p> </p><p>E. O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, ELAB, PGOV, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT:  GOZ BACKS AWAY FROM CONFRONTATION WITH ZCTU? </p><p> </p><p>Ref: Harare 550 </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  An interesting exchange between the Minister of </p><p>Labor, July Moyo, and an employers\' representative </p><p>reportedly took place in a recent Tripartite Negotiating </p><p>Forum meeting.  When the employers\' rep asked the Minister\'s </p><p>view on whether or not his association should be dealing </p><p>with the GOZ-created shell labor organization Zimbabwe </p><p>Federation of Trade Unions (ZFTU), Moyo replied, "There is </p><p>only one king at a time..."  Employer and labor reps both </p><p>took this as an indication that the GOZ was backing away </p><p>from its previous heavy-handed support of the group it </p><p>created to challenge the primacy of the internationally- </p><p>recognized (and opposition aligned) Zimbabwe Congress of </p><p>Trade Unions (ZCTU). </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU)  Comment:  Whether this position reflects the GOZ\'s </p><p>formal strategy is unclear.  There is no doubt that the GOZ </p><p>has gained much useful propaganda (as well as an increased </p><p>veneer of legitimacy) from its very public "consultations" </p><p>with the ZCTU in the TNF meetings (ref).  Last year, the GOZ </p><p>actually paid for the rival ZFTU to attend and "advise" at </p><p>the International Labor Organization\'s (ILO\'s) annual </p><p>convention in Geneva -- although it ultimately granted the </p><p>ZCTU formal recognition as the accredited labor </p><p>representative -- where the government gained widespread </p><p>international condemnation for its campaign against </p><p>organized labor in general and the ZCTU in particular. </p><p>Whether or not the GOZ insists on ZFTU participation in this </p><p>year\'s ILO conference in May may well indicate its long-term </p><p>intentions towards the ZCTU.  End comment. </p><p> </p><p>Sullivan </p><p></p></div>
