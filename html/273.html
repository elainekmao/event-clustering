<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 BEIJING 14047 </p><p> </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12356: DECL:OADR </p><p>TAGS:  PGOV, PHUM, SOCI, CH </p><p>SUBJECT:  SITREP NO. 6:  THE SCENE ON TIANANMEN, THE </p><p>          MILITARY SITUATION, POSSIBLE CENTRAL </p><p>          COMMITTEE MEETING, CHINESE PRESS PLAY </p><p> </p><p>REFS.:  A.  BEIJING 14038  B.  BEIJING 14039 </p><p>-       C.  BEIJING 14037  D.  BEIJING 14029 </p><p>-       E.  BEIJING 14019 </p><p> </p><p>1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. </p><p> </p><p>2.  SUMMARY:  BETWEEN 10 AND 20,000 STUDENTS OCCUPIED </p><p>TIANANMEN SQUARE AT NOON ON MAY 21.  THE ATMOSPHERE </p><p>WAS FESTIVE AND THEY APPEARED CONFIDENT.  ONLOOKERS </p><p>NEAR THE SQUARE NUMBERED BETWEEN 50,000 AND 80,000. </p><p>ACCORDING TO A STUDENT ON THE SQUARE, 100-200 HUNGER </p><p>STRIKERS REMAIN.  STUDENTS CONTINUE TO CONTROL MUCH </p><p>OF CENTRAL BEIJING IN THE AREA OF TIANANMEN.  THEY </p><p>CONTROL ACCESS TO THE CITY THROUGH AN ELABORATE </p><p>SYSTEM OF BLOCKADES.  STUDENT ORGANIZERS APPEAR TO BE </p><p>IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH DEMONSTRATORS MANNING THE </p><p>ROADBLOCKS AND CAN DISPATCH REINFORCEMENTS TO WEAK </p><p>POINTS.  THIS SUGGESTS TO US THAT DEMONSTRATORS MAY </p><p>BE GETTING SUPPORT FROM NEIGHBORHOOD PARTY AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  AT 11:00 PM, MAY 20, A POLITICAL DECISION WAS </p><p>MADE TO MOVE TROOPS INTO TIANANMEN AT 2:00 AM, </p><p>MAY 21.  THE ORDER WAS RESCINDED BETWEEN 1:00 AM AND </p><p>2:00 AM, ACCORDING TO DAO BEIJING.  AT PRESENT, </p><p>STUDENTS APPEAR TO FEAR AN ASSAULT ON THE SQUARE </p><p>EITHER FROM BEIJING\'S TUNNEL SYSTEM OR VIA MILITARY </p><p>TRAIN INTO THE CITY. </p><p> </p><p>4.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HELD A </p><p>MEETING BETWEEN MAY 19 AND MAY 21 AT WHICH AT LEAST </p><p>ONE MEMBER STRONGLY OBJECTED TO MARTIAL LAW.  WE HAVE </p><p>BEEN UNABLE TO CONFIRM THIS.  PEOPLE\'S DAILY COVERAGE </p><p>OF THE EVENTS OF THE LAST TWO DAYS SUGGESTS CONTINUED </p><p>RESISTANCE TO LI PENG IN THE MEDIA.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE SCENE ON TIANANMEN AS OF 12:15 PM, MAY 21 </p><p>--------------------------------------------- </p><p>5.  STUDENTS REMAIN IN CONTROL OF CENTRAL BEIJING. </p><p>ACCORDING TO POLOFFS ON TIANANMEN SQUARE, THE NUMBER </p><p>OF ONLOOKERS IN THE AREA ROSE BETWEEN 10:00 AM AND </p><p>NOON.  APPROXIMATELY 50-80,000 ONLOOKERS CROWD </p><p>CHANGAN AVENUE FROM THE BEIJING HOTEL IN THE EAST TO </p><p>THE WEST SIDE OF THE SQUARE.  POLOFFS HAVE REPORTED </p><p>THAT STUDENTS ON THE SQUARE ITSELF NUMBER BETWEEN 10 </p><p>AND 20,OOO.  A STUDENT GUARD ON THE SQUARE TOLD </p><p>POLOFFS THAT BETWEEN 100 AND 200 HUNGER STRIKERS </p><p>REMAIN.  THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE SQUARE IS FESTIVE. </p><p>MANY ONLOOKERS STROLL ABOUT IN THEIR SUNDAY BEST. </p><p>STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS APPEAR CONFIDENT, POLOFFS </p><p>REPORTED. </p><p> </p><p>6.  THE PATTERN OF ACTIVITY ON THE SQUARE HAS </p><p>REMAINED FAIRLY CONSTANT OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. </p><p>GENERALLY, THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AT TIANANMEN DWINDLE </p><p>THROUGHOUT THE MORNING AND BEGIN TO RECOVER DURING </p><p>THE AFTERNOON.  CROWDS BEGIN ARRIVING DURING THE </p><p>EVENING BETWEEN 7:00 PM AND 8:00 PM AND PEAK IN THE </p><p>LATE EVENING. </p><p> </p><p>ABOUT BARRICADES </p><p>---------------- </p><p>7.  AS REPORTED EARLIER, STUDENTS APPEAR TO CONTROL </p><p>ACCESS TO THE CENTRAL PART OF THE CITY THROUGH A </p><p>SYSTEM OF BARRICADES AROUND THE SECOND AND THIRD RING </p><p>ROADS AND AT OTHER MAJOR ROAD APPROACHES TO THE </p><p>CITY.  AT TIMES, WE HAVE SEEN BARRICADES OF PEOPLE OR </p><p>VEHICLES ON THE CLOSER APPROACHES TO TIANANMEN SQUARE </p><p>AS WELL. </p><p> </p><p>8.  POLOFF VISITING ONE SUCH ROADBLOCK AT THE </p><p>INTERSECTION OF THE THIRD RING ROAD AND JIANGUOMENWAI </p><p>AVENUE REPORTED THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 50 BUSSES IN </p><p>THE AREA.  FOURTEEN BUSSES BENEATH THE JIANGUOMENWAI </p><p>AVENUE OVERPASS CONTROL PASSAGE ON THE THIRD RING </p><p>ROAD, WHICH RUNS NORTH-SOUTH.  THE BUSSES HAVE LEFT A </p><p>ONE LANE OPENING ALONG THE ROAD AND CAN EASILY BLOCK </p><p>TRAFFIC BY DRIVING INTO THE LANE.  SEVERAL OTHER OF </p><p>THE BUSSES BLOCK BOTH ENDS OF THE OVERPASS.  MANY OF </p><p>THE REMAINING BUSSES PARKED ALONG JIANGUOMENWAI UP TO </p><p>XIDAWANG ROAD COULD BE PULLED INTO THE AVENUE TO </p><p>BLOCK TROOPS, ACCORDING TO POLOFF. </p><p> </p><p>9.  POLOFF REPORTED THAT CITY BUS DRIVERS ARE </p><p>RESPONSIBLE FOR MOVING THEIR VEHICLES AT THIS </p><p>BARRICADE.  ONE APPARENTLY FEARLESS DRIVER WITH WHOM </p><p>POLOFF TALKED STATED THAT HE AND HIS FELLOWS ARE </p><p>CONFIDENT THAT THEIR BLOCKADES WILL STOP PLA TANKS. </p><p>(BUT WE DOUBT IT.)  HE ADDED THAT DRIVERS INTEND TO </p><p>REMAIN AT THE INTERSECTION AND WILL NOT RETURN TO </p><p>WORK ON MAY 22. </p><p> </p><p>10.  ACCORDING TO A STUDENT AT QINGHUA UNIVERSITY WHO </p><p>SPOKE WITH AN EMBASSY FCS OFFICER PRESENT AT THE </p><p>CAMPUS THIS MORNING, STUDENTS ON CAMPUS ARE IN CLOSE </p><p>TOUCH WITH DEMONSTRATORS MANNING THE BARRICADES AND </p><p>ARE ABLE TO DISPATCH REINFORCEMENTS TO WEAK SPOTS IN </p><p>THE SYSTEM.  EMBOFFS HAVE WITNESSED LARGE CONVOYS OF </p><p>CIVILIAN MOTORCYCLES ON CHANGAN AVENUE.  IT IS </p><p>POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS ONE METHOD OF COMMUNICATION </p><p>BETWEEN STUDENT ORGANIZERS AND DEMONSTRATORS. </p><p>APPARENTLY STRONG COOPERATION AMONG WORKERS, </p><p>STUDENTS, AND OTHERS AT THE BLOCKADES SUGGESTS TO US </p><p>THAT DEMONSTRATORS MAY BE GETTING SUPPORT FROM </p><p>NEIGHBORHOOD PARTY AND GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>MILITARY SITUATION </p><p>------------------ </p><p>11.  DAO HAS REPORTED EXTENSIVELY ON THE MILITARY </p><p>SITUATION  (REFS. B-E).  BASED ON DAO OBSERVATIONS OF </p><p>PLA ACTIVITIES AND ON DAO CONVERSATIONS WITH MILITARY </p><p>PERSONNEL, AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 PM, MAY 20, A </p><p>POLITICAL DECISION WAS MADE TO MOVE ON TIANANMEN AT </p><p>2:00 AM.  THE ORDER APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN RESCINDED </p><p>BETWEEN 1:00 AM AND 2:00 AM ON MAY 21.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>DAO OBSERVERS, TROOPS AT GUCHENG, ON THE WESTERN SIDE </p><p>OF THE CITY, STOOD DOWN FROM THEIR TRUCKS AND BEGAN </p><p>MINGLING WITH THE LOCAL POPULACE AT ABOUT 8:15 AM. </p><p>IT IS RUMORED THAT AT ABOUT 6:15 AM ON MAY 21 LI PENG </p><p>ANNOUNCED THAT THE ORDER HAD BEEN RESCINDED. </p><p> </p><p>12.  AS OF LATE MORNING, PLA TRUCKS CONVOYING </p><p>SOLDIERS AT GUCHENG HAD TURNED AROUND TO PARK FACING </p><p>IN A DIRECTION AWAY FROM THE CITY.  STUDENTS AT </p><p>TIANANMEN SQUARE AND AT BEIJING UNIVERSITIES </p><p>REPORTEDLY FEAR THAT THE PLA WILL ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE </p><p>SQUARE TONIGHT VIA BEIJING\'S UNDERGROUND TUNNEL </p><p>NETWORK OR VIA A MILITARY TRAIN THROUGH BEIJING </p><p>STATION. </p><p> </p><p>13.  AN AMERICAN CITIZEN REPORTED TO EMBASSY </p><p>AFTERNOON OF MAY 21 THAT  PLA TROOPS HAD TAKEN OVER </p><p>BEIJING\'S CENTRAL RAILWAY STATION.  POLOFF WHO </p><p>SUBSEQUENTLY WENT TO THE STATION SAW NO SIGNS OF A </p><p>PLA PRESENCE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE STATION.  HE </p><p>DID NOT, HOWEVER, OBSERVE THE PLATFORM AREAS, WHICH </p><p>REQUIRE A TICKET TO ENTER.  ALTHOUGH CHINESE STUDENTS </p><p>IN THE VICINITY OF THE STATION ASSURED HIM THAT THE </p><p>SOLDIERS WERE THERE, THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY HAD </p><p>NOT THEMSELVES SEEN THEM.  ONE STUDENT ON TIANANMEN </p><p>SQUARE REPORTED THAT TROOPS HAD ALREADY LEFT THE </p><p>STATION. </p><p> </p><p>14.  AN AMERICAN STUDENT AT BEIJING UNIVERSITY </p><p>REPORTED TO EMBASSY THAT HE WITNESSED TANKS AND PLA </p><p>SOLDIERS AT AN INTERSECTION IN THE VICINITY OF </p><p>BEIJING UNIVERSITY ON THE MORNING OF MAY 21. </p><p>STUDENTS WERE CIRCULATING AMONG THE SOLDIERS, </p><p>ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN.  HE DID NOT SAY HOW MANY </p><p>TANKS WERE PRESENT.  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM </p><p>THIS REPORT.  THE FCS OFFICER AT QINGHUA REPORTED </p><p>WITNESSING LARGE CROWDS OF STUDENTS AT THE GATES OF </p><p>BEIJING AND PEOPLE\'S UNIVERSITIES.  HE DID NOT REPORT </p><p>HAVING SEEN ANY PLA TROOPS IN THE VICINITY OF </p><p>BEIJING\'S UNIVERSITY DISTRICT, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p>ANONYMOUS CALLER REPORTS CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>15.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PARTY CONVENED A CENTRAL </p><p>COMMITTEE (CCPCC) MEETING SOMETIME BETWEEN THE NIGHT </p><p>OF MAY 19 AND EARLY THIS MORNING AT WHICH MEMBERS </p><p>DISSENTED WITH THE DECISION TO EMPLOY THE PLA TO </p><p>RESTORE ORDER IN BEIJING.  AN ANONYMOUS CALLER WHO </p><p>PHONED CONGEN SHENYANG ON THE MORNING OF MAY 21 SAID </p><p>THAT THE PARTY HAD CONVENED A CCPCC MEETING AND THAT </p><p>CHAIRMAN OF THE ALL CHINA FEDERATION OF LABOR UNIONS </p><p>NI ZHIFU CONDEMNED THE DECISION TO IMPOSE MARTIAL LAW. </p><p> </p><p>16.  ACCORDING TO THE CALLER, NI DEMANDED AN END TO </p><p>MARTIAL LAW AND A POSITIVE REASSESSMENT OF THE </p><p>STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS.  HE ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE </p><p>GOVERNMENT HOLD TALKS WITH STUDENT LEADERS.  THE </p><p>CALLER CLAIMED THAT NI THREATENED TO LEAD A GENERAL </p><p>STRIKE IF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE FAILED TO ACCEPT HIS </p><p>DEMANDS.  THE CALLER DID NOT STATE WHEN OR WHERE THE </p><p>MEETING WAS HELD OR IF OUT-OF-TOWN MEMBERS ATTENDED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PEOPLE\'S DAILY COVERAGE SUGGESTS LI PENG GOVERNMENT </p><p>HAS INCOMPLETE CONTROL OVER PRESS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ </p><p>17.  THE MAY 20 AND 21 EDITIONS OF THE PEOPLE\'S DAILY </p><p>INDICATE THAT LI PENG MAY NOT HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER </p><p>THE PRESS.  THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MAY 20 EDITION </p><p>SHOWS COVERAGE OF THE LI PENG AND YANG SHANGKUN </p><p>SPEECHES OF MAY 19.  IT SHOWS PICTURES OF YANG AND </p><p>LI.  HOWEVER, THE UPPER RIGHT SIDE OF THE FRONT PAGE </p><p>DISPLAYS A LARGER PICTURE OF ZHAO ZIYANG ADDRESSING </p><p>STUDENTS AT TIANANMEN ON THE MORNING OF MAY 19. </p><p>BENEATH A HEADLINE STATING THAT ZHAO AND LI PENG </p><p>VISITED THE STUDENTS, BOLDFACED CHARACTERS ANNOUNCE </p><p>THAT "PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY ZHAO SINCERELY HOPES </p><p>THAT STUDENTS WILL LIVE TO SEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF </p><p>THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS." </p><p> </p><p>18.  THIS EDITION MUST HAVE BEEN PRINTED AFTER ZHAO\'S </p><p>RUMORED RESIGNATION/REMOVAL AND AFTER LI AND YANG </p><p>DELIVERED THEIR MAY 19 CALLS FOR THE RESTORATION OF </p><p>ORDER IN THE CAPITAL.  THE COVERAGE OF ZHAO\'S VISIT </p><p>TO TIANANMEN, AS WELL AS THE USE OF HIS FORMAL TITLE </p><p>FURTHER CLOUD THE QUESTION OF ZHAO\'S PRESENT STATUS </p><p>AND WHEREABOUTS. </p><p> </p><p>19.  THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MAY 21 EDITION OF THE </p><p>PEOPLE\'S DAILY HEADLINES THE IMPOSITION OF MARTIAL </p><p>LAW AND THE ISSUANCE OF BEIJING MUNICIPAL </p><p>IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, A SMALL BOX </p><p>IN THE LOWER LEFT OF THE PAGE HEADLINED "THE FIRST </p><p>DAY OF MARTIAL LAW" REPORTS THAT AS OF 4:30 AM, MAY </p><p>21, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS CONTINUED TO </p><p>OCCUPY TIANANMEN SQUARE AND THAT MARCHERS STILL ENTER </p><p>THE SQUARE DURING THE DAY.  WE READ THIS ARTICLE AS A </p><p>SIGNAL TO PROVINCIAL READERS THAT MARTIAL LAW HAS SO </p><p>FAR FAILED TO CONTROL THE SITUATION IN BEIJING. </p><p>CONGENS SHANGHAI AND GUANGZHOU HAVE REPORTED THAT </p><p>THERE IS A NEWS BLACKOUT ON EVENTS IN BEIJING IN </p><p>THESE CITIES.  WE DO NOT KNOW IF TODAY\'S EDITION OF </p><p>THE PEOPLE\'S DAILY HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE OF </p><p>BEIJING, HOWEVER. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>LILLEY </p><p></p></div>
