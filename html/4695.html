<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L ANKARA 008956 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/12/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINS, TU, CY </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: OPPOSITION CHP CAUTIOUSLY HARDLINE ON </p><p>CYPRUS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by acting Political Counselor Nicholas S. </p><p>Kass; reasons: 1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Establishment standard-bearer Republican People\'s </p><p>Party (CHP) has hardened its Cyprus rhetoric during the EU </p><p>summit in Copenhagen.  CHP leader Baykal Dec. 11 publicly </p><p>endorsed President Sezer\'s "protest" decision not to go to </p><p>Copenhagen, claiming the EU wanted to extract concessions </p><p>from Turkey on Cyprus and to present Ankara with a "fait </p><p>accompli" (echoing MFA talking points verbatim). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Our contacts throughout the party are echoing Baykal\'s </p><p>skepticism.  On the one hand, they recognize that the Cyprus </p><p>issue needs to be solved now, given imminent Greek Cypriot </p><p>accession into the EU.  On the other hand, they have not as </p><p>yet shown that they are willing </p><p>to base any solution on current UN plans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Head of CHP\'s women\'s auxiliary group and M.P. Guldal </p><p>Okutucu Dec. 12 told poloffs forcefully that CHP "cannot </p><p>accept the revised plan" submitted by UNSYG Annan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- CHP deputy Yilmaz Ates explained to us that CHP will not </p><p>agree to the Annan plan.  CHP fears that it invites eventual </p><p>Greek domination of the island.  Ates then lambasted the </p><p>ruling AK (Justice and Development) Party for its willingness </p><p>earlier to push for a solution in the run-up to the summit. </p><p>However, according to Ates, after CHP leaders and MFA </p><p>officials had "educated" AK and the Government of PM Abdullah </p><p>Gul, "now they understand." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>Comment </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Cyprus is a neuralgic issue for Turks, particularly </p><p>for those who support the political-bureaucratic </p><p>Establishment\'s point of view.  CHP is positioning itself as </p><p>pro-EU in principle.  It is also trying to burnish its </p><p>Establishment credentials, and position itself for any </p><p>perceived slip by AK, by harping on the dangers of accepting </p><p>the Cyprus plan. </p><p>DEUTSCH </p><p></p></div>
