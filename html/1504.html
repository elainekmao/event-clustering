CALLS FOR JOSEPH KABILA </p><p>TO BE GIVEN MORE TIME, COUPLED WITH THE ABSENCE OF AN </p><p>UNDERPINNING STRATEGY ON THE WAY FORWARD AND AN </p><p>UNWILLINGNESS OR INABILITY TO DEAL WITH THE NEW </p><p>SITUATION IN KINSHASA SUGGEST TO US THE ZIMBABWEANS\' </p><p>PRESENCE IN THE CONGO WAS TIED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE PERSON </p><p>OF LAURENT KABILA.

AJELLO </p><p>CAME AWAY FROM THE MEETING WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE WOULD RESPECT THE LUSAKA ACCORDS IN THE DRC. </p><p>MUGABE TOLD HIM THAT ZIMBABWE WANTS TO GIVE JOSEPH </p><p>KABILA ENOUGH TIME TO ESTABLISH HIS GOVERNMENT AND ITS </p><p>LEGITIMACY, ACCORDING TO SCHOULGIN.  AJELLO PRESENTED </p><p>THE MAIN POINTS REACHED IN THE EU COUNCIL\'S DECLARATION </p><p>ON THE DRC, WHICH CONDEMNED THE ASSASSINATION OF LAURENT </p><p>KABILA AND URGED ALL THE PARTIES IN THE DRC TO ABIDE BY </p><p>THE LUSAKA AGREEMENT.  AJELLO IS TRAVELING TO SOUTH </p><p>AFRICA JANUARY 31 TO EXPAND THE EU\'S DIALOGUE WITH OTHER </p><p>PLAYERS IN THE REGION, THE SWEDISH POLITICAL COUNSELOR </p><p>STATED. </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) BRITISH DEPUTY HIGH COMMISSIONER IAN HAY-CAMPBELL </p><p>(PROTECT) GAVE CHARGE ON JANUARY 31 A READOUT OF </p><p>AJELLO\'S BRIEFING TO EU HEADS OF MISSION OF HIS MEETING </p><p>WITH ZIMBABWEAN FOREIGN MINISTER STANISLAUS MUDENGE THE </p><p>DAY BEFORE.  AJELLO KICKED OFF HIS PRESENTATION SAYING </p><p>THAT AT THE END OF THE MEETING HE WAS NO WISER ON WHAT </p><p>ZIMBABWE WANTS WITH RESPECT TO THE CONGO AND THAT THE </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER\'S ACCOUNT WAS "MUDDLED AND FULL OF </p><p>CONTRADICTIONS."  INDEED THE EU SPECIAL ENVOY OBSERVED, </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S CURRENT POLICY WAS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE </p><p>ONE IT HAD PRIOR TO THE ASSASSINATION. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) MUDENGE SAID THAT INTERNAL DIALOGUE IN THE CONGO </p><p>WAS ESSENTIAL, BUT THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE ARMED </p><p>OPPOSITION WANTED POWER SHARING WITH THE UNARMED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00603  01 OF 02  311347Z </p><p>OPPOSITION, AN ARRANGEMENT THE FOREIGN MINISTER RECKONED </p><p>WOULD PRODUCE "TEN YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP."  THE </p><p>ZIMBABWEAN POLITICO EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT RWANDA WOULD </p><p>GET OUT OF PWETO SOON OR "WE WILL HELP THEM OUT." </p><p>AJELLO WARNED MUDENGE THAT IF ZIMBABWE WENT ON THE </p><p>OFFENSIVE THEN RWANDA WOULD RESPOND BY MOVING ON </p><p>LUBUMBASHI.  THE ZIMBABWEAN FOREIGN MINISTER THEN WENT </p><p>ON TO LIST A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES IN PLAY, WHICH </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE REITERATED TO AJELLO THE NEXT DAY.  HE </p><p>CONFIRMED THAT THE THREE ALLIES AND KABILA WOULD MEET IN </p><p>KINSHASA AT AN UNSPECIFIED DATE, BUT NOT BEFORE ANGOLAN </p><p>PRESIDENT DOS SANTOS RETURNED FROM THE FAR EAST. </p><p>ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT CHILUBA WOULD CHAIR A REGIONAL MEETING </p><p>AT SOME UNSPECIFIED DATE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND SOUTH </p><p>AFRICAN PRESIDENT MBEKI WOULD CONVENE A MAPUTO III </p><p>SUMMIT, ALTHOUGH THE ZIMBABWEAN FOREIGN MINISTER GAVE NO </p><p>DETAILS ABOUT IT.  MUDENGE SAID THE POLITICAL COMMITTEE </p><p>WOULD MEET IN HARARE PRIOR TO THE FEBRUARY 21 UNSC </p><p>MEETING IN NEW YORK.  AJELLO COMMENTED THAT THE SURFEIT </p><p>OF MEETINGS AND INITIATIVES LACKED AN UNDERPINNING </p><p>STRATEGY AND RECOMMENDED THAT THE UNITED NATIONS TAKE </p><p>THE INITIATIVE TO DIRECT THE PEACE PROCESS. </p><p> </p><p>5.

THEY APPEARED TO BE IN CHARGE IN </p><p>KINSHASA WITH 5,000 ELITE TROOPS THERE PLUS TANKS AND </p><p>HELICOPTERS.  THE EU SPECIAL ENVOY REPORTED THAT FOREIGN </p><p>MINISTER MIRANDA TOLD HIM THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE </p><p>LEADERSHIP OF THE DRC WAS THAT IT DID NOT LISTEN TO WHAT </p><p>OTHERS HAD TO SAY.  THE ANGOLAN FOREIGN MINISTER </p><p>BELIEVED THAT ANGOLA HAD THE GREATEST FREEDOM TO </p><p>MANEUVER IN THE CONGO AS IT HAD NO ECONOMIC INTERESTS </p><p>THERE, WHILE ZIMBABWE\'S WERE "DEEP AND SERIOUS."  THE </p><p>ANGOLAN FOREIGN MINISTER RELATED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS </p><p>UNCLEAR AS TO ZIMBABWE\'S REACTION TO THE RECENT EVENTS </p><p>IN THE CONGO, POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE ZIMBABWEANS </p><p>THEMSELVES WERE UNCLEAR ON IT.  THE ANGOLANS HAD IN THE </p><p>PAST BEEN FED UP WITH ZIMBABWE, AS EVERY TIME THEY TRIED </p><p>TO PRESSURE KABILA TO ADHERE TO THE LUSAKA PROCESS, </p><p>ASSUMING ZIMBABWEAN SUPPORT, THE ZIMBABWEANS WOULD TAKE </p><p>AN EXTREME POSITION SIDING WITH KABILA.  THE ANGOLAN </p><p>FOREIGN MINISTER THOUGHT THE LATE CONGOLESE PRESIDENT </p><p>HAD BOUGHT OFF THE ZIMBABWEANS AT THE LAST MOMENT. </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) AJELLO CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT ONE CANNOT IGNORE </p><p>THE ECONOMIC INTEREST OF THE PARTIES AND HE THOUGHT THEY </p><p>WERE MAKING ATTEMPTS TO GUARANTEE THOSE INTERESTS AFTER </p><p>THE WAR.  MUDENGE CONCLUDED THE MEETING BY MAKING IT </p><p>CLEAR TO AJELLO THAT ZIMBABWE\'S TROOPS HAD TO BE OUT OF </p><p>THE CONGO BEFORE THE 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00603  02 OF 02  311347Z </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) COMMENT: PRESIDENT MUGABE\'S REPORTED COMMENT TO </p><p>AJELLO THAT ZIMBABWE WANTS TO GIVE JOSEPH KABILA TIME TO </p><p>ESTABLISH HIS LEGITIMACY HAS BECOME A COMMON REFRAIN </p><p>FROM ZIMBABWEAN OFFICIALS SINCE THE ASSASSINATION.  WE </p><p>BELIEVE IT SUGGESTS A GENUINE UNCERTAINTY AND CONCERN </p><p>ABOUT WHETHER THE NEW CONGOLESE PRESIDENT WILL </p><p>SUFFICIENTLY PROTECT ZIMBABWE\'S ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN </p><p>THE DRC, AND IMPLIES THAT ZIMBABWE\'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE </p><p>DRC WAS TIED DIRECTLY TO THE PERSON OF LAURENT KABILA. </p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS A GROWING PERCEPTION WITHIN </p><p>THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY HERE THAT THE GOZ HAS NOT MOVED </p><p>AGGRESSIVELY TO TRY TO ENSURE A SYMPATHETIC SUCCESSOR TO </p><p>THE ASSASSINATED PRESIDENT BECAUSE IT IS NOT </p><p>SUFFICIENTLY FAMILIAR WITH THE INTERNAL DYNAMICS WITHIN </p><p>THE GDRC.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
