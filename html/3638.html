<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 HARARE 002021 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>USAID FOR ANDREW NATSIOS </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JENDAYI FRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PARIS FOR NEARY </p><p>ROME FOR FODAG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PGOV, PREL, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE\'S BIOTECH BROUHAHA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Political Officer Kimberly Jemison for reasons 1.5 (b) a </p><p>nd (d). </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary.  On 1 September, while attending the WSSD in </p><p>South Africa, Lands, Agriculture, and Rural Resettlement </p><p>Minister Joseph Made proclaimed that Zimbabwe would not </p><p>accept food aid containing genetically modified organisms. </p><p>He also said there was nothing to discuss with the U.S. since </p><p>the Zimbabwean people would not be used as guinea pigs.  The </p><p>latest development in the biotechnology-derived food aid saga </p><p>is not surprising, but does stymie our efforts to get food </p><p>into Zimbabwe.  This latest contradiction between Agriculture </p><p>Minister Joseph Made and Social Welfare Minister July Moyo </p><p>suggests a lack of consensus and objectives within the </p><p>Cabinet on the issue of food.  The ambiguity over </p><p>biotechnology-derived foods, in addition to Zimbabwe not </p><p>signing the memorandum of understanding with the WFP for a </p><p>17500 MT maize swap, puts into question the GOZ,s commitment </p><p>to securing and providing food for its people and forces us </p><p>to consider alternatives, such as providing wheat in lieu of </p><p>maize.  Before that though, WFP Director James Morris arrives </p><p>in Zimbabwe today,September 4, for meetings with Zimbabwean </p><p>officials that, we hope, will lead to a clear GOZ decision to </p><p>go forward with the maize swap arrangement.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>MADE REJECTS BT FOOD </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (U) On 1 September, while attending the WSSD in South </p><p>Africa, Lands, Agriculture, and Rural Resettlement Minister </p><p>Joseph Made proclaimed that Zimbabwe would not accept food </p><p>aid containing genetically modified organisms.  He also said </p><p>there was nothing to discuss with the U.S. since the </p><p>Zimbabwean people would not be used as guinea pigs.  While we </p><p>have not seen a full text of Made\'s remarks, other press </p><p>accounts made it seem that he was referring only to unmilled </p><p>biotechnology-derived (BT) maize. </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) Until this outburst, Zimbabwean officials had only </p><p>rarely cited human health regarding the import of BT food, </p><p>and never in their discussions with us.  Zimbabwe,s </p><p>scientific community had already approved the use of BT foods </p><p>for human consumption but had reservations about BT seed </p><p>germination, cross-pollination, and its potential effect on </p><p>the environment as well as commercial trade with the E.U. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>MOYO ACCEPTS BT FOOD </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) On 29 August, Regional WFP Coordinator Judith Lewis </p><p>told USAID that she had spoken with July Moyo, Minister of </p><p>Public Service, Labor, and Social Welfare, and he indicated </p><p>that he would get the maize swap completed quickly.  He also </p><p>said he was not aware of any problems and thought the </p><p>transfer was a done deal.  In addition to Moyo accepting BT </p><p>foods as safe, Health Minister David Parirenyatwa began his </p><p>speech at a World Health Organization technical meeting of </p><p>health ministers in Harare last week, with comments that BT </p><p>foods are very safe for human consumption.  More recently on </p><p>September 3, Moyo stated to U.N./WFP officials that Made,s </p><p>statements at the Summit do not necessarily reflect final GOZ </p><p>policy on this subject.  NOTE. Minister July Moyo had offered </p><p>in writing to swap 17,500 tons of U.S. BT, whole-kernel maize </p><p>for an equivalent amount of maize in its own reserves.  The </p><p>GOZ would then mill and distribute the U.S. maize while WFP </p><p>would distribute the Zimbabwe maize.  This was intended to be </p><p>a one-time deal but would most likely set a precedent for </p><p>potential future swaps. END NOTE. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) In spite of Moyo,s stated willingness to accept the </p><p>maize swap, Zimbabwe has not signed the memorandum of </p><p>understanding with the WFP, according to Victor Angelo, the </p><p>UN Resident Representative. In a meeting with the Ambassador </p><p>on September 1, Angelo also denied press reports that the GOZ </p><p>has stopped efforts to import grain and would rely solely on </p><p>donated food. </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>ALTERNATIVES TO MAIZE </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) If the issue of BT maize cannot be resolved, we will </p><p>need to consider other alternatives.  Judith Lewis has </p><p>suggested an alternative to maize in the form of an exchange </p><p>of U.S. Emerson Trust wheat with the GOZ for maize for WFP. </p><p>Under such an arrangement, the wheat would go to private </p><p>sector millers and be distributed through the local market </p><p>channels.  We understand why WFP would want to secure the </p><p>swapped maize for distribution but question if this might be </p><p>an unnecessary wrinkle.  Transferring the maize from the GOZ </p><p>to WFP does nothing to address the overall maize deficit but </p><p>may help circumvent grain trading restrictions.  In this </p><p>zero-sum game simply providing U.S. wheat through private </p><p>sector channels might be the best recourse, and at least </p><p>close the gap in urban areas, but we would have to look </p><p>closely at how this would effect local markets and </p><p>competition.  Given that wheat and bread are running out in </p><p>urban areas and that the October wheat harvest will be far </p><p>below average (Made admitted this in an August 30 </p><p>conversation with Victor Angelo), provision of wheat would be </p><p>addressing an increasing food security concern. </p><p> </p><p>7.  COMMENT.  (C) Over the last year, Zimbabwean Cabinet </p><p>ministers have frequently contradicted one another.  On top </p><p>of this, there now appears to be a stalemate within the </p><p>Zimbabwe Cabinet regarding either accepting outside, BT, or </p><p>U.S. donated food aid.  There are clearly those who want as </p><p>little outside food as possible so that GOZ can control the </p><p>distribution.  There could also be a contingent that is </p><p>blocking approval to burnish their anti-imperialist </p><p>credentials. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Even if the GOZ finally signs the MOU and allows the </p><p>17500 MT swap, Zimbabwe will still need 1 million tons of </p><p>maize over the next several months to avert widespread </p><p>starvation.  The GOZ has not done enough to facilitate these </p><p>imports and there are certainly "radicals" in the Cabinet and </p><p>ZANU-PF who prefer to minimize the internationally donated </p><p>food so that ZANU-PF and the GOZ control the bulk of food </p><p>deliveries to the population.  The Government is also under </p><p>pressure to cover petrol imports and other obligations, and </p><p>the little foreign exchange that is available will not be </p><p>able to cover everything.  If Zimbabwe ultimately rejects the </p><p>swap, the likelihood that the country would accept further </p><p>donations of BT maize in the near term is remote, and we </p><p>would have to pursue alternative actions, such as the Emerson </p><p>Trust wheat possibility. END COMMENT. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
