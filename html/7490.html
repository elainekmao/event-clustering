<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KUWAIT 001468 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR NEA/FO </p><p>STATE PASS USAID </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/16/2013 </p><p>TAGS: EAID, PREL, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: ARAB FUND MEETING APRIL 22-23: REQUEST FOR URGENT </p><p>DEMARCHE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reason 1.5 (D). </p><p> </p><p>1.(U) This is an action request -- see paragraph 5. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) At an April 16 meeting with Ambassadors Raphel and </p><p>Carney of the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian </p><p>Assistance (ORHA), AbdulLatif Al-Hamad, Director General of </p><p>the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD) </p><p>pointed out that Iraq\'s membership in the Fund had been </p><p>suspended since 1992, on the basis of some KD 15 million </p><p>(approximately USD 50 million) of arrears Iraq owes to AFESD. </p><p> Each year, the Board of Governors meets to review AFESD </p><p>operations, and each year since 1992 a resolution is adopted </p><p>to continue its suspension  (under current rules the only </p><p>other option is to remove Iraq from the Fund).  Al-Hamad </p><p>explained that he, as Director General, cannot legally </p><p>reengage Iraq to work out a plan to address its arrears </p><p>problem and consider providing any lending or grants for any </p><p>reconstruction in Iraq until the Board of Governors </p><p>(comprising the Finance Ministers of Arab League states) </p><p>approves such an approach. </p><p> </p><p>3.(C) Al-Hamad then noted that the next Board of Governors </p><p>meeting was scheduled for April 22-23 in Abu Dhabi, and that </p><p>the Board only meets once a year.  If the Governors do not </p><p>approve AFESD involvement in Iraq next week, he said, it will </p><p>be a full year before they can revisit the decision (as the </p><p>AFESD charter apparently has no mechanisms for extraordinary </p><p>Board of Governors meetings). </p><p> </p><p>4.(U) Other topics discussed during the meeting are reported </p><p>septel. </p><p> </p><p>5.(C) Action Request:  Given the potential importance of </p><p>AFESD involvement over the next 12 months in Iraq\'s </p><p>reconstruction, Embassy Kuwait and ORHA suggest the following </p><p>points be delivered ASAP in Arab League capitals: </p><p> </p><p>-- The Board of Governors of the Arab Fund for Economic and </p><p>Social Development will meet April 22-23 in Abu Dhabi. </p><p> </p><p>-- We understand that one agenda item will be whether to </p><p>renew Iraq\'s suspension from the organization for non-payment </p><p>of arrears, or to dismiss it from the organization </p><p>altogether. </p><p> </p><p>-- We believe the Arab Fund can and should play an important </p><p>role in the reconstruction of Iraq. </p><p> </p><p>-- We strongly encourage you to introduce and/or approve a </p><p>Board of Governors resolution to authorize the Directors of </p><p>the Arab Fund to engage with Iraq on a plan to address its </p><p>arrears to the Fund and to resume grant and lending </p><p>operations with Iraq. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
