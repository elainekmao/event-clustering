<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 KUWAIT 001813 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/02/2013 </p><p>TAGS: PREL, KU, IZ </p><p>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S APRIL 30 MEETING WITH MINSTATE </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. STATE 103736 B. KUWAIT 1759 </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: The Ambassador met with Minister of State for </p><p>Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah on April 30th. </p><p>Among the issues discussed were Kuwaiti POWs, the future of </p><p>Kuwait\'s fuel donations to coalition forces and the status of </p><p>ongoing efforts to secure an Article 98 agreement with </p><p>Kuwait.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>(C) WAR ISSUES: POWs AND FUEL </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Dr. Mohammed began by raising the issue of Kuwaiti </p><p>POWs, with some of whose families he had met the previous </p><p>night.  Echoing their frustration that coalition forces had </p><p>not encountered any Kuwaiti POWs in Iraq, he relayed the </p><p>concern that coalition forces make every effort to </p><p>interrogate all enemy prisoners of war (EPW\'s) for possible </p><p>information about Kuwaiti POWs.  He said that such </p><p>interrogations were especially significant to the GOK\'s </p><p>ongoing efforts to establish war crimes cases against the </p><p>former Iraqi regime. (Note: The GOK has been pursuing the </p><p>cases of 572 Kuwaitis and 33 persons of other nationalities, </p><p>missing since the Iraqi occupation.  This is a highly </p><p>sensitive issue in Kuwait. End Note.) </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Dr. Mohammed also told the Ambassador that Kuwait </p><p>would soon have to start scaling back its in-kind fuel </p><p>assistance to coalition forces, as the conflict was drawing </p><p>to a close and the GOK was facing budgetary pressures.  He </p><p>noted that coalition fuel requirements were significantly </p><p>less, now that the air campaign is over.  As an aside, he </p><p>also mentioned rumors he had heard that some fuel Kuwait had </p><p>supplied was being sold on the black market in Iraq.  In </p><p>response to the Ambassador\'s questions, Dr. Mohammed said it </p><p>was unclear to him whether this was fuel supplied to the </p><p>coalition or for humanitarian purposes.  He had no further </p><p>information.  The Ambassador urged him to bring any </p><p>information suggesting diversions from coalition stocks to </p><p>U.S. attention at once. </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The Ambassador assured the Minister that coalition </p><p>forces were, in fact, doing everything possible to elicit </p><p>information from EPW\'s, and coordinating very closely with </p><p>GOK bodies charged with Kuwait\'s POW efforts.  He also asked </p><p>him to give the USG as much advance warning as possible about </p><p>any GOK decision to cut back on fuel assistance. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) The Ambassador also gave Dr. Mohammed a readout on the </p><p>4/28 Baghdad meeting of Iraqi political figures.  Dr. </p><p>Mohammed listened intently and asked the Ambassador if the US </p><p>would be advising SCIRI\'s Mohammed Bakr Al-Hakim to be </p><p>present at the group\'s planned future meeting.  SCIRI, he </p><p>said, had been represented at the 3/28 meeting by a lower </p><p>level representative.  They also discussed the possibility of </p><p>Shi\'a cleric Mohammed Bahr al-Oloum\'s returning to Iraq, with </p><p>the Ambassador pointing out the difficulty of the U.S. </p><p>playing a prominent role. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(C) ARTICLE 98 </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C)  The Ambassador delivered Ref A talking points and </p><p>confirmed for Dr. Mohammed that Egypt had concluded an </p><p>Article 98 agreement with the U.S.; the proposed agreement </p><p>with Kuwait extends coverage to all Americans and TCN\'s while </p><p>in U.S. military service, but not civilian contractors.  Dr. </p><p>Mohammed indicated this might be acceptable to Kuwait, and </p><p>asked whether the agreement would cover Free Iraqi Forces </p><p>(FIF), implying that Kuwait would object to this since the </p><p>GOK was still attempting to bring war crimes charges against </p><p>some officials of the former Iraqi regime.  The Ambassador </p><p>explained that the FIF were not technically part of the U.S. </p><p>military, it was doubtful they would be covered by the </p><p>agreement and in any event, the period of coverage would be </p><p>very limited.  Ambassador Babtain from the America\'s </p><p>Department suggested that we should receive an MFA response </p><p>very soon on the latest U.S. draft. </p><p> </p><p>(C) TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) The Ambassador thanked Ambassador Babtain for having </p><p>provided the embassy with copies of Kuwaiti laws prohibiting </p><p>trafficking in persons (Ref B).  However, he stressed, the </p><p>basis upon which the USG would be preparing its </p><p>congressionally-mandated report would be the actual practices </p><p>in Kuwait, not the legal framework.  The Ambassador suggested </p><p>that an extension of Kuwait\'s labor laws to include coverage </p><p>for domestic servants would be one way the GOK could show </p><p>progress on the issue of trafficking in persons.  He </p><p>underscored the embassy\'s desire to continue working urgently </p><p>with the GOK on this issue. </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Comment: The GOK has provided as Assistance-In-Kind </p><p>nearly $200 million in fuel this year.  The need to increase </p><p>security measures in conjunction with Operation Iraqi Freedom </p><p>and the noncomitant terrorist threat forced the GOK to seek a </p><p>supplemental budget allocation of over $1.6 billion; about </p><p>$2000 per Kuwaiti. </p><p>JONES </p><p></p></div>
