(C) DURING THE COURSE OF A CONVERSATION ON ANOTHER </p><p>MATTER NOVEMBER 20, MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE </p><p>PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TOLD AMBASSADOR MCDONALD </p><p>THAT HIS PARTY HAD MADE NO DECISION REGARDING PLANS FOR </p><p>MASS ACTION IN DECEMBER.  HE SAID THAT THE PARTY\'S </p><p>EXECUTIVE WAS SCHEDULED TO MEET ON NOVEMBER 24 AND THAT </p><p>[THE DECISION TO ENGAGE IN MASS ACTION] "WON\'T BE </p><p>CONCRETIZED THEN."  THE AMBASSADOR URGED AGAINST THIS </p><p>COURSE OF ACTION BECAUSE IT WOULD RESULT IN A LIKELY </p><p>LOSS OF LIFE, AND CAUSE PRESIDENT MUGABE TO LASH OUT, </p><p>ALTHOUGH HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE PARTY HAD TO BE TRUE TO </p><p>ITS SUPPORTERS.  TSVANGIRAI REPLIED THAT HE WAS </p><p>"CONSCIOUS OF THE SENSITIVITIES" OF THE INTERNATIONAL </p><p>COMMUNITY AND PROMISED TO WORK TO CHANNEL HIS </p><p>SUPPORTERS\' ANGER PRODUCTIVELY.  HE BLAMED THE PRESS </p><p>BECAUSE IT "WHIPS UP ANGER," ADDING THAT HE WOULD "TAKE </p><p>OUR PEOPLE INTO OUR CONFIDENCE" SO THAT THEY MIGHT </p><p>"ARRIVE AT THE RIGHT CONCLUSION." </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) TSVANGIRAI THEN COMMENTED ON THE WEEKEND FRACAS </p><p>BETWEEN SUPPORTERS OF THE RULING ZANU-PF AND THE MDC IN </p><p>RURAL BEATRICE, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE </p><p>MARONDERA WEST BY-ELECTION.  HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN </p><p>SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS A RALLY THERE, BUT UPON RECEIVING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  06459  201536Z </p><p>INFORMATION OF THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND DECIDED NOT </p><p>TO DO SO.  MDC SUPPORTERS WHO WENT TO BEATRICE TRIED TO </p><p>HOLD A RALLY, BUT FOUND WAR VETERANS AT THEIR CHOSEN </p><p>LOCATION.  THE MDC SUPPORTERS TOLD THE VETERANS TO MOVE, </p><p>AS THEY HAD BOOKED THE SPOT, AT WHICH POINT SHOOTING </p><p>ENSUED.  NO ONE WAS HIT, BUT AT LEAST ONE ZANU-PF </p><p>SUPPORTER WAS RUN OVER IN THE CONFUSION, AS THEY TRIED </p><p>TO BLOCK IN THE MDC SUPPORTERS.  TSVANGIRAI ADMITTED </p><p>THAT SOME MDC MEMBERS WERE BOOKED BY THE POLICE AND WERE </p><p>ANSWERING CHARGES.  HE CONTINUED THAT, "THE WAR VETERANS </p><p>AND MUGABE WON\'T ABANDON VIOLENCE," AND REPORTED THAT </p><p>THERE WERE TWO BY-ELECTIONS COMING UP, ONE IN MARONDERA </p><p>WEST AND THE OTHER IN BIKITA, NEAR MASVINGO.  "I WILL </p><p>NOT BE CAMPAIGNING THERE [IN MARONDERA WEST]," THE MDC </p><p>PRESIDENT STATED.  HE EXPLAINED THAT HIS SUPPORTERS TOLD </p><p>HIM THEY WOULD VOTE FOR THE MDC AND IF HE CAME THEY </p><p>WOULD ATTEND THE RALLY, BUT HIS PRESENCE IN THE DISTRICT </p><p>WOULD ONLY INFLAME THE WAR VETERANS, WHO WOULD COME </p><p>AFTER THEM IN THE NIGHT. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: WE WELCOME THE NEWS ON THE AS YET NOT </p><p>DECIDED-FOR MASS ACTION PLAN.  MASS ACTION IS A BLUNT </p><p>TOOL TO BE USED WITH EXTREME CARE AND WITH GOOD </p><p>PLANNING, NEITHER OF WHICH ELEMENT THE MDC IS EXERCISING </p><p>IN ABUNDANCE OUTSIDE OF PARLIAMENT.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE </p><p>THAT PUBLIC SENTIMENT IS YET AT THE POINT WHERE IT WOULD </p><p>BRING ABOUT THE DESIRED RESULT, FROM EITHER A NUMERIC OR </p><p>PASSION STANDARD.  IN ADDITION, THOUGH HE AND THE PARTY </p><p>HAVE MUCH ON THEIR PLATE, TSVANGIRAI AND THE MDC\'S TOP </p><p>LEADERSHIP APPEAR, AT TIMES TO US, TO BE MORE DISTRACTED </p><p>AND UNFOCUSED THAN WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE.  NEVERTHELESS, </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  06459  201536Z </p><p>THE AMBASSADOR\'S WORDS AND THOSE OF AF ASSISTANT </p><p>SECRETARY RICE AND AF/S DIRECTOR RENDER URGING CAUTION, </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>GIVEN THAT THEY ARE PLAYING WITH FIRE (AND LIVES), SEEM </p><p>TO HAVE HAD SOME EFFECT.  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p>MCDONALD </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
