SUMMARY:  PROVINCIAL PLAINCLOTHES POLICE PREVENTED </p><p>POLOFF FROM MEETING WITH A DISSIDENT HOA HAO MONK IN AN </p><p>GIANG PROVINCE IN THE MEKONG DELTA.  POLICE SAT IN ON </p><p>POLOFF\'S MEETING WITH ANOTHER DISSIDENT MONK IN THE </p><p>SAME PROVINCE, BUT FAILED TO INTIMIDATE HIM OR STOP HIM </p><p>FROM SPEAKING HIS MIND.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>THE MAN WHO CLIMBED THE TREE </p><p>---------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. ON JUNE 24, POLOFF ATTEMPTED TO VISIT HOA HAO MONK </p><p>NAM LIEM (VO THANH LIEM) AT HIS RESIDENCE IN CHO MOI </p><p>DISTRICT, AN GIANG PROVINCE.  NAM LIEM HAD GAINED LOCAL </p><p>CELEBRITY IN 1994, WHEN HE CLIMBED A TALL PINE TREE IN </p><p>HIS BACKYARD TO ESCAPE POLICE WHO HAD COME TO ARREST </p><p>HIM.  AFTER FOUR DAYS, HE CAME DOWN FROM THE TREE, WAS </p><p>ARRESTED, AND SPENT THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IN PRISON. </p><p>POLOFF HAD VISITED HIM AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON IN </p><p>1999 (REF D). </p><p> </p><p>3. IN NOVEMBER 2001, LOCAL POLICE CAME TO TEAR DOWN HOA </p><p>HAO FLAGS THAT LIEM HAD DISPLAYED INSIDE HIS PRIVATE </p><p>PAGODA.  WHILE POLICE WERE INSIDE, LIEM LOCKED THE DOOR </p><p>FROM THE OUTSIDE.  MORE POLICE CAME TO ASSIST, AND LIEM </p><p>WENT UP THE TREE AGAIN.  UPON HIS DESCENT THIS TIME, </p><p>ACCORDING TO HOA HAO SOURCES, THE POLICE GAVE HIM A </p><p>STERN LECTURE, BUT DID NOT ARREST HIM.  DOZENS OF </p><p>LIEM\'S PERSONAL FOLLOWERS CONTINUE TO VISIT HIS PRIVATE </p><p>PAGODA EACH DAY (REFS B AND C). </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00719  01 OF 02  190741Z </p><p>4. WHEN POLOFF ARRIVED AT THE BRICK ENTRYWAY LEADING TO </p><p>NAM LIEM\'S PAGODA ON JUNE 24, THREE YOUNG MEN BLOCKED </p><p>THE WAY.  SEVERAL OTHER MEN WHO APPEARED TO BE WITH </p><p>THEM STOOD ON THE LAWN OF A NEIGHBORING TEA SHOP.  ONE </p><p>OF THE YOUNG MEN WAS HIGHLY AGITATED AND WARNED POLOFF </p><p>TO GO AWAY.  HE SAID THE PEOPLE IN THE AREA DID NOT </p><p>WELCOME AMERICANS AND "DID NOT WANT ANY AMERICANS TO </p><p>DISTURB THE MONK AT THE PAGODA."  POLOFF SAID HE HAD </p><p>VISITED AND HAD BEEN WELCOMED THERE THREE YEARS AGO, </p><p>AND FOUND THE PEOPLE OF THE AREA TO BE FRIENDLY. </p><p>POLOFF INDICATED HE WOULD TURN BACK, HOWEVER, IF </p><p>AUTHORITIES OFFICIALLY HAD PLACED THE LIEM UNDER HOUSE </p><p>ARREST OR OFFICIALLY RESTRICTED VISITORS TO THE PAGODA. </p><p>THE YOUNG MAN, NOW ANGRY AND USING VULGAR LANGUAGE, </p><p>DENIED HE WAS A POLICE OFFICER AND SAID THE MONK WAS </p><p>NOT UNDER ANY RESTRICTIONS.  HE REPRESENTED THE </p><p>COMMUNITY, HE SHOUTED, AND THE COMMUNITY DID NOT WANT </p><p>ANY AMERICANS IN THE VICINITY. </p><p> </p><p>5. POLOFF NOTICED MORE PEOPLE APPROACHING AS THE </p><p>EXCHANGE CONTINUED.  SEVERAL HOA HAO FOLLOWERS </p><p>(DISTINCTIVE BY THEIR HAIR BEING TIED BACK IN A BUN AND </p><p>THEIR WEARING OF PLAIN BLACK OR GRAY TUNICS) LISTENED </p><p>INTENTLY, THEN SOME OF THEM BEGAN ARGUING WITH THE </p><p>YOUNG MEN WHO HAD BLOCKED THE ROAD.  BECAUSE A PHYSICAL </p><p>ALTERCATION APPEARED TO BE IN THE WORKS, POLOFF DECIDED </p><p>TO RETURN TO HIS VEHICLE AND DRIVE AWAY.  POLOFF DROVE </p><p>BY SIX HOURS LATER AND SAW THE SAME GROUP OF YOUNG MEN </p><p>LYING IN WAIT. </p><p> </p><p>6. ONE WEEK LATER, A HOA HAO ELDER IN HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00719  01 OF 02  190741Z </p><p>WENT TO VISIT NAM LIEM.  HE LATER TOLD POLOFF THAT LIEM </p><p>WAS MORTIFIED AT THE LOCAL POLICE TREATMENT OF POLOFF </p><p>AND ASSURED HIM HE WOULD WELCOME VISITS BY POLOFF OR </p><p>ANY OTHER AMERICAN DIPLOMAT.  THE HOA HAO ELDER ALSO </p><p>SAID THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY WAS INFURIATED WHEN THEY </p><p>DISCOVERED THE PLAINCLOTHES POLICE HAD SAID AMERICANS </p><p>WERE UNWELCOME THERE.  RELATIONS BETWEEN THE POLICE AND </p><p>THE COMMUNITY WERE NOW VERY TENSE. </p><p> </p><p>COURAGEOUS EX-PRISONER </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p>7. AFTER BEING TURNED BACK AT THE HOME OF NAM LIEM, </p><p>POLOFF WENT TO TRY TO VISIT ANOTHER DISSIDENT HOA HAO </p><p>MONK, TU TRIET (LE MINH TRIET).  IN OCTOBER 1993, </p><p>AUTHORITIES IN AN GIANG PROVINCE\'S CHO MOI DISTRICT HAD </p><p>ORDERED TU TRIET TO DEMOLISH HIS HOME BECAUSE HE HAD </p><p>BUILT IT IN A PAGODA STYLE WITHOUT GOVERNMENT </p><p>PERMISSION.  HE REFUSED, BUT THEY DEMOLISHED THE HOUSE </p><p>AND CAME TO ARREST HIM.  AS A FUGITIVE, HE WROTE TO THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL MEDIA AND TO THE OVERSEAS HOA HAO </p><p>COMMUNITY SEEKING ASSISTANCE.  FINALLY ARRESTED IN </p><p>MARCH 1994, HE WAS CHARGED AND FOUND GUILTY OF </p><p>"CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW" AND OF "COOPERATING WITH FOREIGN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ5110 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HO CHI  00719  02 OF 02  190741Z </p><p>ACTION DRL-02 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   AMAD-00  CIAE-00  DODE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EB-00    UTED-00  H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   IO-00 </p><p>      LAB-01   L-00     NSAE-00  NSCE-00  OIC-02   OPIC-01  PER-00 </p><p>      PRS-00   P-00     SCT-00   SP-00    SS-00    STR-00   TEST-00 </p><p>      TRSE-00  USIE-00  DSCC-00  PRM-00   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------CD664C  190742Z /38 </p><p>R 190629Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMCONSUL HO CHI MINH CITY </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 6537 </p><p>INFO AMEMBASSY HANOI </p><p>USMISSION GENEVA </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 02 HO CHI MINH CITY 000719 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/BCLTV AND EAP/PD/KFOSTER </p><p>DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>AGENTS WITH THE PURPOSE OF HARMING THE NATIONAL </p><p>INTEREST."  HE WAS SENTENCED TO EIGHT YEARS </p><p>IMPRISONMENT; HE COMPLETED HIS TERM AND WAS RELEASED AT </p><p>THE END OF MARCH 2002. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HO CHI  00719  02 OF 02  190741Z </p><p> </p><p>8. POLOFF HAD DIRECTIONS TO TU TRIET\'S BROTHER\'S HOME </p><p>WHERE TRIET CURRENTLY RESIDES, BUT HAD TO ASK FOR </p><p>SPECIFICS AFTER ARRIVING IN THE GENERAL VICINITY. </p><p>RECEIVING CONTRADICTORY DIRECTIONS FROM DIFFERENT </p><p>PERSONS IS NOT UNUSUAL IN RURAL VIETNAM.  HOWEVER, WITH </p><p>FOUR PLAINCLOTHES POLICE FOLLOWING CLOSELY ON </p><p>MOTORCYCLES, POLOFF WAS CONVINCED THAT NEIGHBORS HAD </p><p>BEEN INSTRUCTED TO GIVE THE WRONG DIRECTIONS.  POLOFF </p><p>HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP WHEN HE NOTICED ONE POLICEMAN WHO </p><p>HAD BEEN FOLLOWING HIM SITTING ON A PORCH NEXT TO A MAN </p><p>CLAD IN WHITE.  THE MAN IN WHITE WAS TRIET. </p><p> </p><p>9. TU TRIET SMILED BROADLY AS POLOFF SAT DOWN.  THREE </p><p>PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMEN SAT DOWN WITH THEM.  THEY </p><p>LISTENED, BUT DID NOT INTERFERE IN THE CONVERSATION. </p><p>TRIET RECOUNTED THE STORY OF HOW AND WHY HE HAD BEEN </p><p>ARRESTED.  HE SAID HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED VISITORS WHILE </p><p>IN PRISON AND HAD BEEN TREATED NO WORSE THAN THE OTHER </p><p>PRISONERS.  HE IS CURRENTLY UNDER A TWO-YEAR </p><p>ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION AND IS NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE </p><p>THE VILLAGE WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE LOCAL POLICE. </p><p> </p><p>10. TU TRIET SAID THAT AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF PRISON, THE </p><p>THING THAT MOST SURPRISED HIM WAS THE DEGREE OF FREEDOM </p><p>OF WORSHIP ENJOYED BY HOA HAO BELIEVERS. (REF A </p><p>DESCRIBES IMPROVEMENTS FOR HOA HAO FREEDOM OF WORSHIP </p><p>SINCE THE GVN RECOGNIZED THE SECT IN 1999.)  TRIET SAID </p><p>HE HOPED TO SEE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS, BUT GLANCING AT </p><p>THE POLICEMAN WHO SAT AT ARM\'S LENGTH AWAY, HE SAID HE </p><p>WAS NOT OPTIMISTIC. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HO CHI  00719  02 OF 02  190741Z </p><p> </p><p>11. TRIET SAID HE OPPOSED THE GVN-SANCTIONED HOA HAO </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE BECAUSE HE BELIEVED ITS </p><p>OFFICERS WERE SELECTED IN A SHAM ELECTION AT A HOA HAO </p><p>CONGRESS THAT WAS DOMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  NOTING </p><p>HIS OWN PAGODA HAD BEEN DESTROYED IN 1994, HE DOUBTED </p><p>HE WOULD RECEIVE PERMISSION TO REBUILD.  POLOFF HAD </p><p>JUST VISITED A NEWLY-CONSTRUCTED HOA HAO PAGODA (REF A) </p><p>AND SUGGESTED TRIET MIGHT TRY MEETING WITH THE </p><p>REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE, EXPLAIN HIS CASE, AND SEE IF </p><p>THEY WOULD SUPPORT HIS BUILDING A NEW PAGODA.  TRIET </p><p>LAUGHED AT FIRST, THEN SEEMED INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA. </p><p> </p><p>12. ASKED IF THERE WAS A MESSAGE TO CONVEY TO THE USG, </p><p>TRIET REPLIED THAT HE GREATLY APPRECIATED U.S. EFFORTS </p><p>ON HIS BEHALF AND "FOR ALL PERSONS WHO HAVE SUFFERED </p><p>ILL-TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF THE GVN."  HE SAID THE </p><p>U.S. WAS A MODEL OF FREEDOM AND THAT THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>WOULD DO WELL TO LOOK AT AMERICA AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE </p><p>POTENTIAL OF A FREE SOCIETY.  (COMMENT: POLOFF FELT </p><p>THAT TU TRIET\'S REMARKS -- IN FRONT OF THREE SULLEN </p><p>POLICEMEN -- WERE THEMSELVES A MODEL OF BRAVERY IN THE </p><p>FACE OF REPRESSION.) </p><p> </p><p>MESSAGE TO THE POLICE </p><p>--------------------- </p><p> </p><p>13. POLOFF ALSO HAD A MESSAGE TO DELIVER, REPEATED </p><p>TWICE DURING THE CONVERSATION.  POLOFF TOLD TRIET HE </p><p>WAS GLAD "OTHERS" PRESENT WERE LISTENING.  NOW THEY </p><p>WOULD KNOW THIS WAS NOT A DANGEROUS/SUBVERSIVE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HO CHI  00719  02 OF 02  190741Z </p><p>CONVERSATION.  POLOFF WOULD REPORT ON HIS MEETING WITH </p><p>TRIET AND ON THE IMPROVEMENTS SEEN OVER THE YEARS IN </p><p>THE HOA HAO SITUATION.  HE WOULD ALSO REPORT THAT </p><p>POLICE HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM MEETING WITH DISSIDENT </p><p>HOA HAO MONK NAM LIEM.  THERE WAS NOTHING LIEM COULD </p><p>HAVE SAID THAT WOULD MAKE THE GVN LOOK WORSE THAN THE </p><p>POLICE THUGS PHYSICALLY BLOCKING THE ROAD TO HIS HOUSE. </p><p>POLOFF SAID HE WAS WORRIED THAT ANY INCREMENTAL </p><p>IMPROVEMENTS THE GVN WAS MAKING IN RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </p><p>WOULD BE OVERSHADOWED BY ITS CONTINUED HARASSMENT OF </p><p>PERSONS WITH DIFFERING VIEWS.
