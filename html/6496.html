<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ANKARA 001720 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR E, P, EUR/SE AND EB; TREASURY FOR OASIA - MILLS </p><p>AND LOEVINGER; USDOC FOR 4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/DDEFALCO; NSC </p><p>FOR QUANRUD AND BRYZA </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/17/2008 </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, PGOV, PREL, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: AK ECONOMIC POLICY:  REFORM ONLY AS A LAST RESORT </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5(b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (C) Summary:  New Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan\'s </p><p>decision not to make any changes in the AK economic team </p><p>suggests he is unlikely to break sharply with the Gul </p><p>government\'s economic appraoch.  That is unfortunate.  In its </p><p>four months in office, the AK leadership has proven that it </p><p>neither understands economics nor embraces reform, and will </p><p>implement sound policies only if the markets give it no </p><p>alternative.  In that sense, the Gul-Erdogan Government is </p><p>similar to the Ecevit government, with the exception that it </p><p>has no Kemal Dervis to provide leadership.  Abdullah Gul won </p><p>some praise from senior bureaucrats, but was not been able to </p><p>provide sufficient economic leadership.  The prospect of a </p><p>large U.S. financial package has supported financial markets </p><p>in recent weeks, but in doing so also has prevented the </p><p>markets from delivering a tough message to the government, </p><p>which misread market stability as an indication of confidence </p><p>in AK leadership.  Now that the bilateral package is off the </p><p>table, we can expect the markets to send a clear signal to </p><p>the Erdogan government on the need for sound policy.  End </p><p>Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) The AK Party came into office in mid-November with a </p><p>mixed message on the economy that attempted to please </p><p>everybody.  To the financial markets and the international </p><p>community, AK espoused a strong commitment to fiscal </p><p>discipline, and to improving the investment climate via </p><p>reforms.  To the Turkish electorate, and especially to core </p><p>constituents among small and medium business people, the </p><p>message was "the new government will stimulate growth and </p><p>create more demand for you."  These contradictory goals are </p><p>evident in AK\'s pre-  and immediate post-election programs, </p><p>including the "Emergency Action Plan" adopted in November. </p><p>The AK government was going to increase social spending, </p><p>stimulate growth, keep a tight budget and accelerate </p><p>disinflation, all at the same time.  But the programs never </p><p>spelled out how. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU) In our early meetings with AK leaders, it was clear </p><p>that despite the pro-reform rhetoric, the heart of AK\'s </p><p>economic policy was with those wanting the GOT to spend its </p><p>way out of recession, "pump priming" as Ali Coskun (AK vice </p><p>chairman for economics and now Minister of Industry) </p><p>repeatedly told us.  It was not enough for AK that exports </p><p>and stock rebuilding in 2002 had resulted in over 6 percent </p><p>growth.  Domestic demand, the key for AK\'s business </p><p>supporters, remained fairly weak in many sectors going into </p><p>2003. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C)  The rhetoric, however, remained firmly pro-reform, </p><p>buttressed by the market friendly utterances of State </p><p>Minister for the Treasury Ali Babacan (an MBA in marketing </p><p>from Northwestern University), and crafted also by AK Vice </p><p>Chairman for media Murat Mercan (a public relations professor </p><p>at Bilkent University).  This rhetoric, and the prospect that </p><p>the first one-party government in 20 years would be able to </p><p>implement the rhetoric, fueled a six-week post-election </p><p>market rally and raised hopes that Turkey could begin to move </p><p>away from the financial precipice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Although much of AK\'s rhetoric has remained </p><p>reform-minded, its actions have not.  In its few months in </p><p>office, the government has engaged in populist measures </p><p>(nearly $3 billion in new spending), publicly undermined </p><p>independent regulatory agencies, tried to gut a </p><p>critically-important public procurement law, and passed an </p><p>unwise tax amnesty law.  Even in the area of privatization, </p><p>where AK\'s public statements have been very positive, the </p><p>government has moved at a snail\'s pace.  AK has stalled on </p><p>IMF and World Bank conditions, including enactment of a sound </p><p>budget.  Moreover, it has alienated both the Fund and the </p><p>Bank by failing to consult with them before announcing key </p><p>actions, and -- in the case of the IMF -- accusing the Fund </p><p>of being "unfair."  As was clear in our bilateral </p><p>negotiations, the government sees possible U.S. assistance as </p><p>an alternative - not a complement -- to sound policy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) The only time the Gul government showed serious </p><p>interest in taking much-needed fiscal measures was when </p><p>markets threatened.  On January 7, weak interest in a large </p><p>Treasury T-bill auction (a 45 percent roll-over rate) led </p><p>Prime Minister Gul to call an emergency meeting and to </p><p>announce significant new fiscal saving measures.  Similarly, </p><p>after dithering with the IMF team for weeks in February, the </p><p>government quickly accepted difficult new taxes and budget </p><p>cuts March 2, immediately after Parliament\'s rejection of the </p><p>troop deployment (and the corollary U.S. financing package) </p><p>threatened a market meltdown.  IMF Mission Chief complained </p><p>to us that, in the month he was here to conclude an LOI, the </p><p>only days in which the GOT worked seriously were March 2 and </p><p>March 9 (after he informed the GOT he was returning to </p><p>Washington with little progress to report.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) The obvious question is why AK has failed to take the </p><p>measures most outside observers believe are essential to </p><p>avoid renewed crisis, despite the fact that the party came in </p><p>on the back of a big electoral win.   Part of the answer lies </p><p>in the demands of the many small entrepreneurs and </p><p>shopkeepers in its constituency, who want continued </p><p>government support, easy credits and protection from big-time </p><p>competition, foreign or Turkish.  There is also a widely held </p><p>perception that AK politicians, having been out of office for </p><p>so long, want to enjoy the spoils the existing system offers. </p><p> This would explain, for example, AK\'s desire to gut the new </p><p>public procurement law.  Another, factor has been the </p><p>perception that further fiscal austerity measures would not </p><p>help AK\'s chances in future elections (including Tayyip </p><p>Erdogan\'s election March 9, and nation-wide local elections </p><p>next year).  Moreover, few if any in AK understand </p><p>macroeconomics, so -- per Central Bank Governor Serdengecti </p><p>-- they are blissfully unaware of the consequences of their </p><p>poor policies (and in some cases believe the U.S. will bail </p><p>Turkey out if necessary).  A senior economic official </p><p>confided to us that the Cabinet as a whole still views the </p><p>economic program as something imposed on the government by </p><p>the IMF.  Finally, the markets have been artificially buoyed </p><p>by the prospect of a large U.S. financial assistance package, </p><p>and thus have failed to send the warning signals one normally </p><p>would expect in the face of bad policies. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C)  In some ways, the AK government has been similar to </p><p>its predecessor, the Ecevit government, which implemented </p><p>reforms only under intense IMF and market pressure.  One </p><p>important difference, however, is that the Ecevit government </p><p>-- while hardly full of economic wizards -- included Kemal </p><p>Dervis, who understood the need for reform and used the </p><p>leverage provided by the IMF to force through </p><p>politically-unpalatable reforms.  In contrast, AK\'s State </p><p>Minister for the Treasury, Ali Babacan, has failed to push </p><p>through reforms.  According to one international reporter, </p><p>Babacan has been mainly interested in enhancing his standing </p><p>in the Party by demonstrating his toughness in negotiations </p><p>with the IMF and the U.S.  He is, in that sense, striving to </p><p>be the "anti-Dervis."  IMF Mission Chief said March 7 that </p><p>Babacan had not even read the draft Letter of Intent that he </p><p>supposedly is negotiating on behalf of his government. </p><p>Others, including Treasury U/S Faik Oztrak, claim that </p><p>Babacan has advocated sound policies in Cabinet meetings, but </p><p>has lacked the clout to push them through. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9.  (C) The rest of the economic team is no better than </p><p>Babacan, and possibly worse.  At least Babacan understands </p><p>the need to communicate to the markets.   IMF Mission Chief </p><p>(strictly protect) called the team "totally incompetent" and </p><p>a "hopeless bunch."  Central Bank Governor Serdengecti (also </p><p>strictly protect) said it was like having a bunch of </p><p>small-town politicians run a government.  Deputy Prime </p><p>Minister Abdullatif Sener, who is responsible for economic </p><p>issues, is best known for having advocated abolition of </p><p>interest rates during his tenure as Finance Minister during </p><p>the Erbakan government.  He has been such an enigmatic figure </p><p>in meetings with us and other foreign diplomats that none of </p><p>us can say with any confidence that we know where he stands </p><p>on any issue.  Finance Minister Kemal Unakitan (a former tax </p><p>inspector who became a consultant and reportedly has a </p><p>pending tax fraud case)  also appears to be in over his head. </p><p> Central Bank Governor Sureyya Serdengecti told us recently </p><p>that Unakitan dismissed the Banks highly-praised inflation </p><p>expectation surveys, asking how a survey of only 50-100 </p><p>people in a country of 67 million could be useful.  IMF </p><p>sources say Unakitan "doesn\'t get it."  State Minister for </p><p>Trade Kemal Tuzmen is a bombastic self-promoter who sees </p><p>Turkey\'s future in trade with Iraq, Algeria, and other nearby </p><p>states and who has no apparent understanding of economics. </p><p>European diplomats believe Industry Minister Ali Coskun, who </p><p>has long advocated populist spending and was a strong </p><p>proponent of the government\'s tax amnesty, is exercising </p><p>significant, negative behind-the-scenes influence with </p><p>Erdogan.  The opposition CHP, including Kemal Dervis, has </p><p>failed to offer useful criticism or policy alternatives. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10.  (C) As Prime Minister, Abdullah Gul received relatively </p><p>good marks from economic bureaucrats, who say he had the best </p><p>understanding of the economic picture of anyone in the </p><p>cabinet.  However, Gul was so busy with other issues that he </p><p>was not been able to provide steady economic leadership. </p><p>Moreover, he was often undermined by others within AK. </p><p>Tayyip Erdogan, for example, committed the government to high </p><p>hazelnut support prices, and has supported other populist </p><p>measures.  Per IMF sources, when Gul (at urging of Treasury </p><p>U/S Oztrak) agreed to some key budgetary and regulatory steps </p><p>during Ali Babacan\'s absence, Babacan returned, complained to </p><p>Erdogan, and took back the measures to which Gul had agreed. </p><p>(Gul subsequently announced these same measures, and others, </p><p>on March 3, in the aftermath of Parliament\'s negative vote on </p><p>troop deployment.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.   (C) The case for optimism rests not with the new </p><p>Erdogan government, which appears likely to continue the </p><p>policies of the Gul government.  Rather it is with the </p><p>continuation of certain structural reforms already enacted </p><p>(e.g., Central Bank independence, and reductions in banking </p><p>sector exposure to foreign exchange risk), the current set of </p><p>senior economic bureaucrats (particularly Central Bank </p><p>Governor Serdengecti and Treasury U/S Oztrak), and with the </p><p>prospect that -- with the U.S. economic package off the table </p><p>-- markets will begin to deliver a clear message on the need </p><p>for sound policy. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
