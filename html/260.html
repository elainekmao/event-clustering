SUMMARY:  HUN SEN\'S PRECEDENT SETTING VISIT TO </p><p>BANGKOK REVEALED NO NEW PRK FLEXIBILITY ON THE KEY </p><p>ASPECTS OF AN INTERNAL SETTLEMENT.  HE REMAINS OPPOSED TO </p><p>AND INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING FORCE AND TO SIHANOUK\'S </p><p>PROPOSALS.  IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM, THE THAI </p><p>APPARENTLY FOCUSED ON THE EXTERNAL ASPECTS OF A </p><p>SETTLEMENT (AND BUISNESS DEALS) AFTER BEING REBUFFED WHEN </p><p>THEY RAISED THE INTERNAL ISSUES.

END SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>ARRIVAL </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  PRK PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN ARRIVED HERE YESTERDAY </p><p>MORNING ON A SPECIAL THAI AIR FORCE FLIGHT FROM </p><p>VIENTIANE.  HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A 22-MEMBER ENTOURAGE </p><p>INCLUDING:  HIS WIFE; GENERAL TIE BANH, VICE CHAIRMAN OF </p><p>THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND DEFENSE MINISTER; KONG </p><p>SAM-OL, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS; DIT </p><p>MUNTI, FIRST DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS; CHAM </p><p>PRASIT, DEPUTY MINISTER ATTACHED TO THE COUNCIL OF </p><p>MINISTERS; AND LONG KEM, PRK AMBASSADOR TO LAOS. </p><p> </p><p>3.  HUN SEN WAS ESCORTED ON THE FLIGHT FROM VIENTIANE BY </p><p>TWO OF PRIME MINISTER CHATCHAI\'S ADVISERS -- M.R. </p><p>SUKHUMPHAN BORIPHAT AND DR. SURAKIAT SATHIRATHAI.  ON </p><p>ARRIVAL HE WAS GREETED AT THE AIRPORT BY PM\'S OFFICE </p><p>MINISTER ANUWAT WATTANAPONGSIRI.  THE PM\'S SON, KRAISAK, </p><p>AND THE HEAD OF HIS PRIVATE ADVISORY GROUP, PHANSAK </p><p>WINYARAT WERE ON HAND TO GREET HIM ON ARRIVAL AT THE </p><p>HYATT CENTRAL PLAZA HOTEL. </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>PRESS CONFERENCE </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.  AFTER LUNCH, HUN SEN GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE AT WHICH </p><p>HE ACCUSED THE THREE RESISTANCE FACTIONS OF BEING </p><p>INFLEXIBLE AND REITERATED HIS DETERMINATION TO PREVENT </p><p>POL POT FROM COMMING BACK.  HE ALSO CONDITIONED HIS </p><p>SUPPORT FOR A SEPTEMBER WITHDRAWAL OF THE VIETNAMESE </p><p>FORCES ON A "POLITICAL SOLUTION" BEING "ATTAINED," </p><p>INCLUDING CESSATION OF INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE </p><p>THREE KHMER RESISTANCE GROUPS.  HE DID, HOWEVER, OFFER </p><p>THAT THE PRK WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN INTERNATIONAL </p><p>ASSISTANCE CUT OFF AT THE SAME TIME AS THE OTHER FACTIONS. </p><p> </p><p>5.  HUN SEN ENDORSED AN INTERNATIONAL CONTROL COMMISSION </p><p>TO VERIFY THE VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL, TO OVERSEE THE </p><p>CESSATION OF AID AND TO "MONITOR" THE GENERAL ELECTION. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE REJECTED AN INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING FORCE </p><p>ARGUING THAT "WE PEOPLE CAN PROTECT OUR OWN PEACE IF THE </p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY STOPS SUPPORTING POL POT.  IF </p><p>FOREIGN COUNTRIES STOP SUPPORTING POL POT, I CAN </p><p>GUARANTEE HE CAN NOT RETURN TO POWER IN KAMPUCHEA." </p><p> </p><p>6.  HUN SEN ALSO SAID THAT THE PRK HAD ALREADY RELEASED, </p><p>FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS, MORE THAN 200 THAI CAPTURED IN </p><p>CAMBODIA AND THAT ANOTHER 300 WOULD SOON BE RELEASED. </p><p>MOST OF THESE PEOPLE WERE ALLEGEDLY FORTUNE-HUNTERS </p><p>DIGGING GEMSTONES IN WESTERN CAMBODIA. </p><p> </p><p>7.  ON REFUGEE ISSUES, HE SAID THAT HE HAD ALREADY SIGNED </p><p>AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED NATION HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR </p><p>REFUGEES ON "PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES" FOR REPATRIATING </p><p>REFUGEES.   HE ANTICIPATED DISCUSSING THIS PROBLEM WITH </p><p>PM CHATCHAI.  "WE ARE WILLING TO WELCOME REFUGEES WHO </p><p>WANT TO GO HOME, IF THAILAND COOPERATES AND AN AGREEMENT </p><p>IS REACHED." </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>MEETING AT PM\'S RESIDENCE </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>8.  FOLLOWING THE PRESS CONFERENCE, HUN SEN PROCEEDED IN </p><p>THE LATE AFTERNOON TO THE PM\'S RESIDENCE FOR TWO HOURS OF </p><p>TALKS.  GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SUWIT YOTMANI SAID THAT THE </p><p>TALKS, WHICH WERE "FRANK AND FRIENDLY," INCLUDED FM </p><p>SITTHI, RTA CINC GENERAL CHAWALIT AND PM\'S SECRETARY </p><p>GENERAL PANYA SINGSAKDA.  ALSO PARTICIPATING FROM THE MFA </p><p>WERE PERMSEC KASEM, POLITICO-MILITARY COORDINATOR LT GEN </p><p>CHARAN, POLITICAL DEPARTMENT DG THEP, AND AMBASSADOR AT </p><p>LARGE SARASIN.  MILITARY REPRESENTATION INCLUDED RTA </p><p>DEPUTY CINC GENERAL WANCHAI, RTA CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL </p><p>CHARUAY AND SUPREME COMMAND CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL SUNTHON. </p><p> </p><p>9.  FM SITTHI REPORTEDLY LEFT THE MEETING ONE HOUR BEFORE </p><p>IT ADJOURNED, AND HE DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE </p><p>SUBSEQUENT DINNER CRUISE. </p><p> </p><p>10.  REPORTS OF WHAT TRANSPIRED IN THE MEETING ARE </p><p>SKETCHY, BUT ACCORDING TO "THE NATION," THERE WERE SOME </p><p>TENSIONS WHEN THAI DELEGATES RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE </p><p>"MODALITY" OF CONSTITUTING A RECONCILIATION GOVERNMENT. </p><p>HUN SEN BRIDLED AT THIS, ARGUING IT SHOULD BE LEFT FOR </p><p>THE FOUR CAMBODIAN FACTIONS TO DISCUSS.  CHATCHAI </p><p>REPORTEDLY DROPPED THE SUBJECT, AND THE TALKS CONTINUED </p><p>IN A MORE RELAXED ATMOSPHERE.  FM SITTHI HAD SAID EARLIER </p><p>THAT THE THAI WOULD NOT "BARGAIN" WITH HUN SEN (OVER </p><p>INTERNAL ISSUES), BECAUSE "WE ARE NOT KHMERS."  IN THE </p><p>SAME VEIN, GENERAL CHAWALIT SAID THAT THAILAND WILL LEAVE </p><p>THE KHMER FACTIONS TO RESOLVE THEIR INTERNAL CONFLICT. </p><p>BUT HE ADDED THAT THAILAND HAD TO INVOLVE ITSELF IN THE </p><p>PEACE PROCESS WHICH MAY STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. </p><p> </p><p>11.  ONE SOURCE SITED IN "THE NATION" CLAIMED THAT BOTH </p><p>SIDES HAD AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO THE GRADUAL REDUCTION OF </p><p>EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE RIVAL KHMER FACTIONS WHILE THE </p><p>VIETNAMESE TROOPS ARE WITHDRAWN.  BOTH PROCESSES WOULD BE </p><p>SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY AN INTERNATIONAL MECHANISM YET </p><p>TO BE ESTABLISHED.  OTHER "NATION" SOURCES, HOWEVER, WERE </p><p>"MORE CAUTIOUS" AND SAID ONLY THAT HUN SEN HAD NOT </p><p>SOFTENED HIS POSITIONS. </p><p> </p><p>12.  HUN SEN REPORTEDLY PROPOSED REGULAR CONSULTATIONS </p><p>BETWEEN THE RTG AND PHNOM PENH.  ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT </p><p>SPOKESMAN SUWIT, PM CHATCHAI AGREED TO THIS PROPOSAL. </p><p>THE GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THAT PM CHATCHAI "WILL </p><p>TRY TO DO WHATEVER HE COULD" WITH REGARD TO HUN SEN\'S </p><p>SUGGESTION THAT THAILAND HOST FOUR-PARTY KHMER PEACE </p><p>TALKS.  HOWEVER, IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN UNTIL AFTER JIM 2 IN </p><p>JAKARTA IN FEBRUARY. </p><p> </p><p>13.  THAI ARMY TEVEVISION COVERAGE HAD HUN SEN SAYING </p><p>THAT HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT SIHANOUK\'S PROPOSALS DEALING </p><p>WITH A JOINT ARMY AND GENERAL ELECTIONS.  HE INSISTED </p><p>THAT THE PRK MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO UNTIL AN ELECTION IS </p><p>HELD TO DETERMINE WHO WOULD GOVERN THE COUNTRY. </p><p> </p><p>14.  ONE BANGKOK POST SOURCE SAID THAT HUN SEN REITERATED </p><p>MANY OF THE POINTS HE MADE IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT </p><p>HE ALSO DISCUSSED THE OPENING OF TRADE LINKS WITH </p><p>THAILAND.  HUN SEN SAID THE TWO COUNTRIES COULD DO </p><p>BUSINESS IN FISHING, LOGGING AND GEMS, RESOURCES WHICH </p><p>REMAIN PLENTIFUL IN THE WAR-TORN COUNTRY.  ACCORDING TO </p><p>ONE ACCOUNT, KONG SAM-OL, HUN SEN\'S VICE PRIME MINISTER, </p><p>WAS TO HOLD TALKS WITH SENIOR THAI OFFICALS ON WAYS TO </p><p>DEVELOP TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. </p><p> </p><p>----------- </p><p>SOCIALIZING </p><p>----------- </p><p> </p><p>14.  FOLLOWING THE MEETING, PM CHATCHAI AND KHUNYING </p><p>BOONRUEN HOSTED HUN SEN AND WIFE TO A DINNER CRUISE WHERE </p><p>TALKS CONTINUED UNDER TIGHT SECURITY FROM AN ARMADA OF </p><p>POLICE BOATS.  MFA PERMSEC IS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT THE </p><p>INTERNAL ASPECTS OF A SETTLEMENT REMAINED UNRESOLVED.  FM </p><p>SITTHI DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE SOCIAL EVENT AT ALL. </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>OPEN ENDED </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  PM CHATCHAI AND HUN SEN CONTINUED THEIR TALKS AT A </p><p>WORKING BREAKFAST TODAY AT HUN SEN\'S HOTEL BEFORE </p><p>CHATCHAI DEPARTED FOR THE PHILIPPINES.  ACCORDING TO ONE </p><p>REPORT, THE PM\'S ADVISORS MAY HAVE PERSUADED HUN SEN TO </p><p>EXTEND HIS VISIT AN ADDITIONAL DAY AND TO LEAVE FOR PHNOM </p><p>PENH TOMORROW, AND ALL ACCOUNTS AGREE THAT HE COULD SO </p><p>EXTEND HIS VISIT IF HE WISHED. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>O\'DONOHUE </p><p></p></div>
