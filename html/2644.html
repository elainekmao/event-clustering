<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L KATHMANDU 000570 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>LONDON FOR POL/RIEDEL </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/18/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PTER, ASEC, PHUM, PREL, PINR, NP, Maoist Insurgency </p><p>SUBJECT: NEPALESE ARMY ROUTS MAOIST TRAINING CAMP; BANDH </p><p>PREPARATIONS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: AMBASSADOR MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI, REASONS 1.5(B),(D) </p><p> </p><p>Army Takes Out Terrorist Training Camp </p><p>-------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Sixty-five Maoist insurgents were killed in a joint </p><p>Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) and Armed Police Force (APF) </p><p>operation March 17 against a suspected Maoist training camp </p><p>in Gumsa, Rolpa district, about 300 miles northwest of </p><p>Kathmandu, the head of the APF confirmed to Post March 19. </p><p>No prisoners were taken.  A police source told us that after </p><p>the operation musket guns and homemade explosives had been </p><p>confiscated from the training camp. </p><p> </p><p>RNA: Offensive to Continue </p><p>-------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) An RNA contact judged the operation a success, and </p><p>pointed out that it resulted in the death of Maoist leaders </p><p>and trainers.  He indicated that follow-up operations will </p><p>continue and similar operations would be conducted in the </p><p>future in order to exert pressure on the Moaists in Rolpa and </p><p>other areas they control.  The operation demonstrated the </p><p>need to conduct joint operations with the police, served to </p><p>improve the police\'s morale, and showed that the unified </p><p>command concept was working.  Our contact added that the RNA </p><p>did not just want to rely on helicopters, and wanted to </p><p>develop its capacity to conduct operations on foot. </p><p>(Comment:  The RNA recognizes that the summer monsoon will </p><p>hamper heliborne operations, and that offensive operations </p><p>will of necessity involve infantry on foot.) </p><p> </p><p>Preparations for Upcoming Bandh </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) At a meeting at the Home Ministry March 19, the head </p><p>of the APF told A/DCM and Poloff that the government had </p><p>instructed public servants to report to work during the April </p><p>2-6 general strike ("bandh") called by the Maoists. </p><p>Government vehicles would be out on the roads.  The Home </p><p>Ministry would issue directives and public notices to </p><p>encourage people to conduct business as usual, and police </p><p>personnel would be "vigilant" in apprehending agitators who </p><p>attempted to shut down shops, offices or schools.  RNA </p><p>officers informed Post separately that they would step up </p><p>vigilance and urge the government to carry on as normal. </p><p> </p><p>Comment: Boxing Days </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The RNA\'s apparently successful operation against the </p><p>training camp - smack in the middle of the Maoists\' </p><p>stronghold - gives a boost to the security forces just as </p><p>they had begun to feel the rope against their backs.  The </p><p>Maoists\' may have thought that they could go ten rounds and </p><p>win on a split decision.  Having seen the security forces\' </p><p>right jab in Rolpa, they may now be revisiting that strategy. </p><p> Resource contraints and a lack of trained reserves will </p><p>continue to hold back the army.  However - and hopefully - </p><p>our RNA contact\'s statement about not relying on helicopters </p><p>may mean that the military is finally taking the war to the </p><p>insurgents - on the guerillas terms. </p><p>MALINOWSKI </p><p></p></div>
