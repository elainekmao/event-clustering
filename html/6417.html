(U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright for reasons 1.5 (b) </p><p>       and (d). </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Summary and comment: Following his return from the WTO </p><p>services negotiations in Geneva, UAE Ministry of Economy </p><p>Director of WTO Affairs (and head of the UAE\'s delegation) </p><p>Saeed Al-Nasibi confirmed to Econoff on March 15 that the </p><p>UAE will submit an initial offer on services commitments -- </p><p>but not by March 31 -- and is unlikely to consider </p><p>liberalization of service sectors in the near future. Al-Nasibi </p><p>also said that the UAEG would not support recent U.S. proposals </p><p>on Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on Public Health and </p><p>Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA).  Although Al- Nasibi </p><p>articulated clearly the UAEG\'s position on these issues, he and </p><p>his staff could benefit from a better understanding of our </p><p>proposals and how they factor into the dynamics of WTO </p><p>negotiations.  End summary and comment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>UAE Will Not Open Services Sectors </p><p>---------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Al-Nasibi confirmed that the UAE will submit an initial </p><p>GATS offer on services commitments, but "like almost everyone </p><p>else in the WTO," will not meet the March 31 deadline.  Our </p><p>interlocutor acknowledged the benefits of liberalization of </p><p>services (per ref A), but said that the UAE is not ready for </p><p>foreign competition. Despite calls for liberalization from </p><p>business-minded Dubai, Al-Nasibi intimated that conservative </p><p>elements within the Abu Dhabi Government opposed any moves </p><p>to open most services sectors.  He speculated that financial </p><p>services would be the first area the UAEG would eventually open </p><p>to foreigners. </p><p> </p><p>No Support For U.S. Moratorium On TRIPs... </p><p>------------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) Al-Nasibi also confirmed that the UAE would not add its </p><p>name to the list of countries to voluntarily "opt out" of the </p><p>compulsory licensing mechanism should a public health crisis </p><p>arise (ref B).  He noted that any solution under the Doha </p><p>Declaration should be made available to all WTO members </p><p>regardless of their development status; the UAE is not poor in </p><p>terms of revenue, but has a great need to develop its domestic </p><p>manufacturing capabilities.  Al-Nasibi also said that the U.S. </p><p>definition of "public health crisis" is too narrow, and the UAEG </p><p>should be allowed to determine its own public health situation </p><p>and make vital medicines available to all. The UAE position -- </p><p>which is congruent with the EU proposal on Paragraph 6, </p><p>according to Al-Nasibi -- is that WTO Members should consult </p><p>with the World Health Organization to find a permanent solution. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>...Or The U.S. Proposal On NAMA </p><p>------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) In response to the U.S. proposal on non-agricultural </p><p>market access submitted to the WTO in December (ref C), </p><p>Al-Nasibi complained that the timetable for the reduction of </p><p>tariffs to 5 percent by 2010, and elimination of tariffs by </p><p>2015, was entirely too long.  The UAE already has an applied </p><p>external tariff of 5 percent and is willing to reduce that </p><p>further through multilateral negotiations and in conjunction </p><p>with the GCC Customs Union.  While the UAEG supports the </p><p>spirit of our proposal, Al-Nasibi said they could not support </p><p>the current language and favor a more aggressive timetable for </p><p>the elimination of non-agricultural tariffs. </p><p> </p><p>Wahba </p><p></p></div>
