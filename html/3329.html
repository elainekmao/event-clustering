SUMMARY. ITALY IS UNLIKELY TO ELIMINATE ITS DEFICIT </p><p>BEFORE 2005, ACCORDING TO THE GOI\'S RECENTLY RELEASED </p><p>FOUR-YEAR BUDGET PLAN (DPEF).  GOI PLANS FOR SUBSTANTIAL </p><p>TAX CUTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT, COMBINED WITH </p><p>LESS OPTIMISTIC ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS, LIKELY RULE OUT A </p><p>BALANCED BUDGET BEFORE 2005.  AN EU OFFICIAL EXPRESSED </p><p>CONCERN, AS DID SOME ITALIAN ECONOMISTS, THAT ITALY HAD </p><p>POSTPONED THE BALANCED BUDGET BY ONE YEAR. NONETHLESS, </p><p>THE GOI EXPECTS THE TAX CUTS AND INVESTMENT TO GENERATE </p><p>ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND ANTICIPATES STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN </p><p>FISCAL AND OTHER ECONOMIC INDICATORS OVER THE NEXT </p><p>SEVERAL YEARS.  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  THE GOVERNMENT OF ITALY\'S FOUR-YEAR BUDGET PLAN </p><p>(DPEF), WHICH OUTLINES BUDGET PRIORITIES AND </p><p>ASSUMPTIONS, WAS APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS ON </p><p>JULY 5 AND PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT ON JULY 10. THE </p><p>DOCUMENT MUST BE REVIEWED BY PARLIAMENT BEFORE THE </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03551  01 OF 03  180615Z </p><p>SUMMER RECESS IN LATE JULY OR EARLY AUGUST.  THE DPEF </p><p>PREVIEWS THE 2003 FINANCIAL LAW THAT WILL BE PRESENTED </p><p>TO PARLIAMENT IN LATE SEPTEMBER. </p><p> </p><p>3.  ITALY WILL NOT REACH ITS BALANCED BUDGET TARGET BY </p><p>2004, BUT INSTEAD IN 2005.  PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI </p><p>RECENTLY ANNOUNCED GOVERNMENT PLANS TO REDUCE CORPORATE </p><p>AND PERSONAL INCOME TAXES BY SEVEN BILLION EURO IN 2003. </p><p>THE DPEF DOES NOT INDICATE SPECIFIC SPENDING CUTS TO </p><p>OFFSET THIS LOSS IN TAX REVENUE, BUT MENTIONS A DEFICIT </p><p>REDUCTION PACKAGE "AROUND ONE PERCENT OF GDP", EQUAL TO </p><p>EURO 12.5 BILLION. THE GOI EXPECTS THE DEFICIT/GDP RATIO </p><p>TO BE 1.1 PERCENT AT THE END OF 2002 AND TO DECLINE TO </p><p>0.8 PERCENT AT END-2003. </p><p> </p><p>DPEF 2003-1006 </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>4.   THE KEY ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS IN THE DPEF ARE: </p><p> </p><p>-- REAL GDP GROWTH OF 1.3 PERCENT IN 2002, 3 PERCENT IN </p><p>2003-2004 AND 3.1 PERCENT IN 2005-2006;  (NOTE: THIS MAY </p><p>BE TOO OPTIMISTIC.  THE LATEST CONSENSUS FORECAST </p><p>ASSUMES 1.2 PERCENT GROWTH IN 2002. A HIGHER LEVEL WOULD </p><p>REQUIRE A STRONG RECOVERY IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2002.) </p><p> </p><p>-- DEBT FALLING STEADILY FROM 109.4 PERCENT OF GDP IN </p><p>2001 TO 95 PERCENT IN 2006, AS PART OF A LONG-TERM PLAN </p><p>TO REACH THE EMU TARGET OF 60 PERCENT BY 2011;  (NOTE: </p><p>THE 2001 DPEF, FOR 2002-2005, ASSUMED A 95 PERCENT </p><p>TARGET IN 2004.) </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03551  01 OF 03  180615Z </p><p> </p><p>-- TAX BURDEN FALLING, AS A PERCENT OF GDP, FROM 42.4 </p><p>PERCENT IN 2001 TO 39.8 PERCENT IN 2006, MOSTLY IN FAVOR </p><p>OF LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED </p><p>COMPANIES. </p><p> </p><p>-- TAX CUTS, THE FIRST TRANCHE OF WHICH EXEMPTS FROM </p><p>TAXES INCOMES BETWEEN 6,197 EURO (3,098 EURO FOR SELF- </p><p>EMPLOYED) TO 10,329 EURO, AND REDUCES TAX RATES FROM 24- </p><p>32 PERCENT TO 23 PERCENT (FOR INCOMES RANGING FROM </p><p>10,329 TO 30,987 EURO). </p><p> </p><p>-- INFLATION BELOW 2 PERCENT PER YEAR, DECELERATING FROM </p><p>2.7 PERCENT IN 2001, TO 1.7 PERCENT IN 2002, 1.4 PERCENT </p><p>IN 2003 AND 1.2 PERCENT IN 2006;  (NOTE:  A 1.7 PERCENT </p><p>INFLATION RATE FOR 2002 WOULD BE 50 BASIS POINTS BELOW </p><p>THE JUNE LEVEL OF 2.2 PERCENT, 70 BASIS POINTS BELOW THE </p><p>2.4 AVERAGE FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2002 AND 60 BASIS </p><p>POINTS BELOW THE LATEST CONSENSUS ESTIMATES OF 2.2 </p><p>PERCENT FOR 2002.) </p><p> </p><p>-- INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT INCREASING, PRIMARILY IN </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1434 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03551  02 OF 03  180615Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     UTED-00  FOE-00   VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  FMP-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------CCD00A  180615Z /20 </p><p>P 180531Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC 4945 </p><p>INFO USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2745 </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 02 OF 03 ROME 003551 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA, EB/IFB/OMA </p><p>LABOR FOR ILAB </p><p>PARIS ALSO FOR USOECD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03551  02 OF 03  180615Z </p><p>TREAS FOR OASIA -HARLOW, JONES </p><p>STATE PASS CEA </p><p>STATE PASS FRB FOR GUST </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR WALLAR </p><p>USDOC 6800/ITA/TD/OTEA/TISD/HSCHULTZ AND </p><p>4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, KPRP, ELAB, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY: 4-YEAR FINANCIAL PLAN 2003-2006 </p><p> </p><p>THE SOUTH; PUBLIC INVESTMENT SPENDING WILL BE ACCOUNTED </p><p>OFF BUDGET THROUGH A NEWLY-ESTABLISHED AUTONOMOUS </p><p>CONTRACTING FIRM FOR LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. </p><p> </p><p>-- UNEMPLOYMENT, RESULTING FROM ECONOMIC RECOVERY </p><p>COMBINED WITH MEASURES TO INCREASE FLEXIBILITY IN THE </p><p>LABOR MARKET; FALLING FROM 9.5 PERCENT IN 2001 TO 9.1 </p><p>PERCENT IN 2002 AND TO 6.8 PERCENT IN 2006.

A RECENT RULING IN BRUSSELS MAY CHANGE GROWTH </p><p>ESTIMATES. IN EARLY JULY, EUROSTAT (THE EUROPEAN BUREAU </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03551  02 OF 03  180615Z </p><p>OF STATISTICS) DECLARED THAT ITALY MAY NOT USE </p><p>BORROWINGS AGAINST FUTURE PROPERTY SALES AND LOTTERY </p><p>REVENUES TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT FIGURE.  AS A RESULT, </p><p>THEY STATED, THE GDP DEFICIT FOR 2001 MUST BE REVISED </p><p>UPWARD - FROM 1.6 TO 2.2 PERCENT OF GDP.  THE RULING </p><p>AGAINST THESE ACCOUNTING METHODS ALSO PUTS PRESSURE ON </p><p>FUTURE TARGETS. </p><p> </p><p>6.  ACCORDING TO MARCELLO MESSORI, ECONOMIST AND </p><p>PRESIDENT OF MEFOP (THE GOI INSTITUTION FOR PENSION </p><p>FUNDS), THE EUROSTAT DECISION WILL MAKE IT MORE </p><p>DIFFICULT FOR THE GOI TO SELL SECURITIES BACKED BY </p><p>FUTURE INCOME.  MESSORI  TOLD US THAT THE EUROSTAT </p><p>DECISION HAD BEEN EXPECTED, BUT THAT MOST ITALIAN </p><p>ANALYSTS EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD BE LIMITED TO THE </p><p>SECURITIZATION OF LOTTERY PROCEEDS. </p><p> </p><p>7. FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI HAS AFFIRMED THAT THE GOI </p><p>WILL CONTINUE TO SELL ASSET-BACKED BONDS, VALUED AT </p><p>CLOSE TO SEVEN BILLION EURO, TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT.  THE </p><p>GOI WILL MODIFY THE WAY IT SELLS ASSET-BACKED DEBT, </p><p>WHICH WILL LIKELY BE BACKED BY FEWER PROPERTIES.  (NOTE: </p><p>PREVIOUSLY, THE FACE VALUE OF ASSETS WAS LOWER THAN THE </p><p>VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL-BACKING SUCH ASSETS.  FOR </p><p>EXAMPLE, IN 2001, THE GOI RAISED 2.3 BILLION EURO BY </p><p>SELLING A BOND BACKED WITH 3.2 BILLION EURO IN REAL </p><p>ESTATE.) </p><p> </p><p>PRIVATIZATIONS </p><p>-------------- </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03551  02 OF 03  180615Z </p><p>8. THE GOI WILL PROCEED WITH PRIVATIZATIONS TO OFFSET </p><p>THE BUDGET SHORTFALL.  ACCORDING TO THE DPEF AND </p><p>GOVERNMENT STATEMENTS, THE FIRST TO BE PRIVATIZED WILL </p><p>BE THE RESIDUAL STAKE OF TELECOM ITALIA (3.46 PERCENT), </p><p>ETI (ENTE TABACCHI ITALIANI  - ITALY\'S NATIONAL TOBACCO </p><p>COMPANY) AND 85 PERCENT OF TIRRENIA (MARITIME </p><p>TRANSPORTATION), AS WELL AS ANOTHER TRANCHE OF ENEL </p><p>(ELECTRICITY CONGLOMERATE), TERNA (100 PERCENT ENEL- </p><p>OWNED ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION COMPANY) AND GESTORE </p><p>DELLA RETE (100 PERCENT ENEL-OWNED ELECTRICITY NETWORK </p><p>MANAGEMENT COMPANY). THE GOI ALSO PLANS TO REDUCE ITS </p><p>STAKE IN ALITALIA OVER THE NEXT 18 MONTHS, "BUT NOT </p><p>BELOW 30 PERCENT".  THE FINANCE MINISTRY OWNS 67.58 </p><p>PERCENT OF ENEL AND 62.4 PERCENT OF ALITALIA. </p><p> </p><p>9. UNCERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE, HOWEVER, RAISED </p><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT BOTH HOW FAST THE GOI WILL PROCEED WITH </p><p>THESE PRIVATIZATIONS AND THE REVENUES THAT WILL BE </p><p>REALIZED.  WHEN THE MARKET RECOVERS, THE GOVERNMENT </p><p>HOPES SALES OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED ENTITIES AND SHARES WILL </p><p>BRING IN 20 BILLION EURO. </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>                           UNCLASSIFIED     PTQ1423 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        ROME  03551  03 OF 03  180613Z </p><p>ACTION EUR-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   AID-00   CIAE-00  CTME-00  DODE-00  ITCE-00  WHA-00 </p><p>      EAP-00   EB-00    EXME-00  E-00     UTED-00  FOE-00   VC-00 </p><p>      FRB-00   H-01     TEDE-00  INR-00   ITC-01   VCE-00   AC-01 </p><p>      NSAE-00  OMB-01   OPIC-01  ACE-00   SP-00    SSO-00   STR-00 </p><p>      TEST-00  TRSE-00  USIE-00  FMP-00   DRL-02   G-00     SAS-00 </p><p>        /007W </p><p>                  ------------------CCCFD6  180613Z /20 </p><p>P 180531Z JUL 02 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY ROME </p><p>TO DEPT OF TREASURY WASHDC PRIORITY </p><p>SECSTATE WASHDC 4946 </p><p>INFO USDOC WASHDC </p><p>DEPT OF LABOR WASHDC </p><p>EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE </p><p>AMEMBASSY OTTAWA </p><p>USEU BRUSSELS 2746 </p><p>AMEMBASSY TOKYO </p><p>AMCONSUL MILAN </p><p>AMCONSUL FLORENCE </p><p>AMCONSUL NAPLES </p><p>AMCONSUL FRANKFURT </p><p> </p><p>UNCLAS SECTION 03 OF 03 ROME 003551 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR EUR/WE, EUR/ERA, EB/IFB/OMA </p><p>LABOR FOR ILAB </p><p>PARIS ALSO FOR USOECD </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        ROME  03551  03 OF 03  180613Z </p><p>TREAS FOR OASIA -HARLOW, JONES </p><p>STATE PASS CEA </p><p>STATE PASS FRB FOR GUST </p><p>FRANKFURT FOR WALLAR </p><p>USDOC 6800/ITA/TD/OTEA/TISD/HSCHULTZ AND </p><p>4212/ITA/MAC/OEURA/CPD/DDEFALCO </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958:  N/A </p><p>TAGS: ECON, EFIN, KPRP, ELAB, IT </p><p>SUBJECT: ITALY: 4-YEAR FINANCIAL PLAN 2003-2006 </p><p> </p><p>THE DPEF DEBATE </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  THE EU COMMISSION HAD BEEN KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON </p><p>ITALY\'S BUDGET AND HAD SAID REPEATEDLY THAT IT EXPECTED </p><p>A GOI BUDGET CLOSE TO BALANCE IN 2003 AND IN BALANCE IN </p><p>2004.  THUS, EU REACTION TO THE DPEF ECONOMIC PLAN WAS </p><p>GENERALLY NEGATIVE.  THE SPOKESPERSON FOR EU </p><p>COMMISSIONER FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS PEDRO SOLBES SAID THAT </p><p>THE GOI\'S 0.8 PERCENT DEFICIT/GDP TARGET FOR 2003 WAS </p><p>TOO HIGH TO BE CONSIDERED "CLOSE TO BALANCE" AS AGREED </p><p>IN THE LAST EU MEETING IN SEVILLE. </p><p> </p><p>11.  FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI RESPONDED UNEQUIVOCALLY </p><p>THAT "WE ARE ABSOLUTELY IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE </p><p>STABILITY PACT."  PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI AGREED, </p><p>DECLARING THAT "I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY </p><p>CONCERN REGARDING MINISTER TREMONTI\'S DPEF, WHICH I </p><p>BELIVE RESPECTS COMPLETELY THE MAASTRICHT PARAMETERS, AS </p><p>WELL AS A FLEXIBLE INTERPRETATION OF THE LIMITS </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        ROME  03551  03 OF 03  180613Z </p><p>INDICATED BY ECOFIN IN MADRID AND THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL </p><p>IN SEVILLE." </p><p> </p><p>12.  ON JULY 15, DURING THE PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW OF THE </p><p>DPEF, THE PRESIDENT OF THE "CORTE DEI CONTI" (ITALY\'S </p><p>SUPREME AUDIT COURT) STATED THAT THE GOI WOULD NEED A </p><p>DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE OF E19 BILLION TO BRING THE </p><p>DEFICIT/GDP RATIO TO 0.8 PERCENT IN 2003.  THIS IS WELL </p><p>ABOVE THE E12.5 BILLION LEVEL GIVEN BY DEPUTY FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER BALDASSARRI. </p><p> </p><p>13. FORMER TREASURY MINISTER VISCO, OF THE OPPOSITION </p><p>CENTER-LEFT, ECHOED THE CRITICISM, STATING "IT WILL BE A </p><p>HUGE MANEUVER, ALMOST 2 PERCENT OF GDP". </p><p> </p><p>14.  CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR ANTONIO FAZIO ALSO COMMENTED </p><p>TO PARLIAMENT ON THE DPEF.  FAZIO AGREED WITH THE GOI </p><p>THAT TAX CUTS WERE ESSENTIAL AND THAT A GOI PUBLIC WORKS </p><p>PROGRAM SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY.  HOWEVER, HE </p><p>ALSO DECLARED THAT THE GOI NEEDED TO ACT URGENTLY TO CUT </p><p>HEALTH AND SOCIAL SECURITY EXPENDITURES, INCREASE THE </p><p>RETIREMENT AGE AND, DEVELOP SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION FUNDS. </p><p>FAZIO ALSO CALLED FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF ONE-TIME BUDGET </p><p>MEASURES (SUCH AS ASSET SALES) WITH DURABLE BUDGET </p><p>MEASURES TO CONTROL SPENDING AND ASSURE STABLE REVENUES. </p><p>REGARDING THE DPEF\'S MACRO ASSUMPTIONS, FAZIO SAID THAT </p><p>THE 1.3 PERCENT GROWTH THIS YEAR ASSUMES A DRAMATIC FOUR </p><p>PERCENT ACCELERATION DURING THE LAST TWO QUARTERS OF </p><p>2002. SUCH GROWTH RATES ARE POSSIBLE ONLY IF A FIVE </p><p>BILLION EURO INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PROGRAM IS </p><p>IMPLEMENTED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2002. </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        ROME  03551  03 OF 03  180613Z </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>15.  THE DPEF ASSUMPTIONS OF HIGHER GROWTH AND LOWER </p><p>INFLATION DURING 2002 MAY BE OPTIMISTIC, AND SOME </p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL SPENDING CUTS MAY BE NECESSARY, BUT FINANCE </p><p>MINISTER TREMONTI HAS CREATED A REASONABLY REALISTIC </p><p>DOCUMENT IN HIS 2002 DPEF.  FACED WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN </p><p>BALANCING THE BUDGET BY 2003 OR IMPLEMENTING PROMISED </p><p>TAX CUTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT, TREMONTI HAS </p><p>CHOSEN THE LATTER.  HE INSISTS, AND CENTRAL BANK </p><p>PRESIDENT FAZIO AGREES, THAT THESE MEASURES ARE </p><p>NECESSARY FOR LONG TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH AND A FISCAL </p><p>BALANCE THAT CAN BE SUSTAINED ONCE REACHED.  FAZIO IS ON </p><p>TARGET WITH HIS CALL FOR FURTHER MEASURES, INCLUDING </p><p>PENSION REFORM, AND DEEPER SPENDING CUTS.  MINISTER </p><p>TREMONTI HAS TOLD US THAT HE AGREES AND HOPES TO CARRY </p><p>THESE OUT IN THE LONGER TERM. </p><p>SEMBLER </p><p> </p><p>                       UNCLASSIFIED </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p> 2002ROME03551 - Classification: UNCLASSIFIED </p><p></p><p></p></div>
