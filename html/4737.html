<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 ANKARA 008994 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/16/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINS, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: TURKEY: CONTROVERSIAL MEHMET AGAR REPLACES TANSU </p><p>CILLER AT HELM OF CENTER-RIGHT DYP </p><p> </p><p>REF: ANKARA 2431 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter.  Reason: </p><p>1.5 (b,d) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) Summary: Mehmet Agar, elected in November as in </p><p>independent M.P. and a notorious figure in the Susurluk </p><p>"State-Mafia" scandal of the mid-1990s, is the new leader of </p><p>center-right DYP, elected to replace former P.M. Tansu Ciller </p><p>at Dec. 14 DYP Convention in Ankara.  Agar will likely steer </p><p>DYP along a more nationalistic course.  While running counter </p><p>to prevailing popular interest in a more open and modern </p><p>society, such a course may help the party draw support from </p><p>disaffected youth and other elements that went for the </p><p>upstart Genc Party in November.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Agar In... </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) Poloffs Dec. 14 attended the center-right True Path </p><p>Party\'s (DYP) extraordinary congress, held to elect a leader </p><p>to replace Tansu Ciller after the party\'s bitter defeat in </p><p>the Nov. 3 national elections. (After DYP just missed passing </p><p>the 10 percent national vote barrier, Ciller declared her </p><p>intention to step aside).  Mehmet Agar, who in the mid-1990s </p><p>served as then P.M. Ciller\'s Interior Minister, won a </p><p>landslide victory, tallying 815 of some 1109 valid delegate </p><p>votes.  Ilhan Kesici, though Ciller\'s favorite and a former </p><p>DYPer who returned to the party after the elections, finished </p><p>a distant second with 227 votes.  One senior DYP official and </p><p>close Embassy contact claimed Ciller was busy parleying with </p><p>Kesici up to the last minute in a failed effort to keep Agar </p><p>from the top spot.  She failed; with the handwriting on the </p><p>wall, she delivered a tearful farewell speech to the </p><p>assembled host. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------- </p><p>...The Dragon Lady Out </p><p>---------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) Although Ciller had announced that she would not stand </p><p>for party chairman again, she apparently had tried to </p><p>engineer a comeback at the convention.  Before the </p><p>convention, some DYP contacts noted that, given the </p><p>"extraordinary" nature of the proceedings the party did not </p><p>have time to draw up a new slate of delegates and instead </p><p>relied on a cadre long cultivated and controlled by Ciller. </p><p>In the event, DYP\'s defeat at the polls Nov. 3 had burst the </p><p>Ciller balloon, sending even loyal associates scrambling for </p><p>safe haven.  Party Vice Chairman M. Selim Ensarioglu, until </p><p>virtually the last minute a key Ciller backer, told </p><p>D/Polcouns Dec. 12 that Agar was likely to win -- and that an </p><p>Agar victory would mean the end of Ciller.  Ensarioglu, a </p><p>Kurd, said he opposed the more aggressive, police-oriented </p><p>nationalism espoused by Agar, but was leaning toward him for </p><p>practical political reasons.  In the event, Ensarioglu held </p><p>on to his Vice Chairmanship.  Ciller advisor Omer Barutcu </p><p>told poloff Dec. 13 that if Agar won, Ciller would have "no </p><p>chance" to return to the Party helm in the future, though he </p><p>added that she is too ambitious to simply go quietly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p>Agar Hams It Up at "Funereal" Convention </p><p>---------------------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) The convention was poorly organized and devoid of the </p><p>usual enthusiasm and fanfare -- in the words of one DYPer, </p><p>"more like a funeral" than a party assembly.  Ankara\'s </p><p>Ataturk Sports Hall, long a venue for such events, was </p><p>stifling even by normal sweat-house Turkish standards; the </p><p>intense cigarette smoke caused two elderly women to pass out </p><p>and the Master of Ceremonies to plead twice for attendees to </p><p>refrain from lighting up their cheap Turkish cigarettes. </p><p>Signs at the gates admonished those present to leave their </p><p>guns and other weapons at home, though many apparently </p><p>decided to ignore the advice.  (Several senior DYP officials </p><p>had expressed concern before and during the conference that </p><p>given the high stakes involved, the event could turn </p><p>violent).  The usually simple task of choosing the party </p><p>board turned into an hours-long and contentious process </p><p>because proper ballot cards had not been printed.  Despite </p><p>their overwhelming numbers, Agar supporters could muster only </p><p>a few half-hearted "Prime Minister Agar" cheers. </p><p>5. (C) In his acceptance speech, Agar declared his goal is to </p><p>"unite the right" by first imposing unity and discipline on </p><p>the (moribund) DYP.  Apparently inspired by a line attributed </p><p>to Cardinal Richelieu in Dumas\' "The Three Musketeers," Agar </p><p>defended the 1996 "Susurluk" scandal -- the shadowy nexus </p><p>among senior officials of the military and Security Forces, </p><p>"mainstream" politicians, and criminal gangs involved in </p><p>fighting terror with terror and turning drug profits in the </p><p>Kurdish southeast (reftel and previous) -- asserting that </p><p>"whatever was done was done for the good of the State" and </p><p>not for personal gain. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>Bio: Agar Takes DYP Rightward </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) Agar, a former Governor of Erzurum and Chief of the </p><p>Turkish National Police, is best known for his role with </p><p>Ciller at the epicenter of Susurluk.  While Ciller tried to </p><p>defend these actions and Susurluk perpetrators, she also </p><p>eventually tried to dump her one-time confidant Agar, who as </p><p>a DYP Member of Parliament was never tried for his alleged </p><p>crimes.  Agar was reelected 1999 and again in 2002 as an </p><p>independent from his home province of Elazig in </p><p>east-southeastern Turkey.  Claiming to be of Turkish origin, </p><p>Agar reportedly speaks the Zaza dialect of Kurdish that is </p><p>widespread in the region; according to one former Elazig </p><p>M.P., local Kurdish tribes have long supported Turkish </p><p>ultranationalist figures against rival tribal and other </p><p>organizations.  Agar\'s strength lies in his reputation as a </p><p>man of the people with strong interpersonal skills and a </p><p>godfather-like presence.  A graduate of Ankara University\'s </p><p>prestigious Political Science Faculty, Agar is married with </p><p>two children.  Another child died of an illness in the late </p><p>1990s. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) Agar has some advantages.  DYP\'s electoral defeat </p><p>prompted it to clean house.  The new party leadership roster </p><p>is comprised of little-known and indeed some shadowy figures. </p><p> According to several sources, Agar\'s political eminence </p><p>grise is Ramazan Emre, an elderly man listed only as a member </p><p>of the Central Administrative Board but whom we have seen </p><p>making the rounds of Ankara tea-houses and back-room </p><p>establishments with an entourage fit for a kingmaker.  Also, </p><p>despite its electoral defeat DYP tallied nearly 10 percent of </p><p>the vote, which if handled correctly could provide it with a </p><p>suitable base upon which to rebuild -- particularly given the </p><p>near obliteration of DYP\'s rivals, the Nationalist Movement </p><p>(MHP) and center-right Motherland (ANAP) parties.  Ensarioglu </p><p>averred to us that Agar\'s presence in DYP will help reform </p><p>the hard right along more center-right lines.  Others, </p><p>including a former DYP M.P. now an AK (Justice and </p><p>Development) Party member, worry that Agar will "MHP-ize" his </p><p>party: transform DYP into a carbon copy of the </p><p>ultranationalists. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) Agar\'s major liability is his association with </p><p>Susurluk in the eyes of a public eager for an end to </p><p>corruption in politics and the State, and a nationalism that </p><p>runs counter to the prevailing interest in a more open, </p><p>democratic society -- but which might win it enough </p><p>additional votes from erstwhile Genc (Youth) Party supporters </p><p>next time around.  As Ensarioglu told us Dec. 12, "if there </p><p>was a national election on the horizon, Kesici would have </p><p>been the better man.  But with the ruling AK holding a </p><p>commanding majority and in no danger of early elections, Agar </p><p>is the better man.  At least, he\'s still in Parliament" as </p><p>the only DYP M.P.  Asked whether the new DYP leader would be </p><p>a place-holder or the party leader into the next election </p><p>cycle, Barutcu speculated that the new DYP boss will face a </p><p>challenge if the party fails to do well in the next municipal </p><p>elections.  Our contacts note that those polls must be held </p><p>no later than the spring of 2004, but could come early next </p><p>year. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
