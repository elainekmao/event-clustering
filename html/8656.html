ABUJA 205 </p><p>     B. ABUJA 743 </p><p>     C. ABUJA 989 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) </p><p>AND (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  (S/NF) SUMMARY: June 7 DCM paid a farewell call on </p><p>former Minister of Defense LTG (ret.) T.Y. Danjuma. </p><p>Danjuma did not expect the GON to conclude an Article 98 </p><p>agreement and doubted the Commission of Inquiry\'s report on </p><p>the October 2001 Benue massacre would satisfy the U.S. </p><p>Congress since the report failed to identify culpable </p><p>individuals.  Danjuma also expressed frustration with </p><p>endemic corruption in the GON. END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------- </p><p>Article 98 </p><p>---------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (S/NF) Former Defense Minister Danjuma (strictly </p><p>protect) strongly doubted Nigeria would sign an Article 98 </p><p>agreement.  Reiterating what he had told us in prior </p><p>meetings, Danjuma said that Nigeria would likely mirror </p><p>South Africa\'s decision - a refusal to conclude an </p><p>agreement.  An inter-ministerial committee had met to </p><p>develop a recommendation for President Obasanjo; the </p><p>members were Danjuma, (former) Foreign Minister Sule </p><p>Lamido, (former) Attorney General Kanu Agabi and another </p><p>Minister who Danjuma could not recall.  On the date of the </p><p>meeting, Danjuma had been ill, so Agabi (chair) called to </p><p>seek his views.  Danjuma advised that Nigeria should stay </p><p>in step with South Africa; he personally thought Article 98 </p><p>agreements "would weaken the UN" and thus had reservations. </p><p>He counseled again that the committee should learn why </p><p>South Africa had declined to sign before making a final </p><p>recommendation to President Obasanjo.  Danjuma said Agabi </p><p>voiced surprise since he expected Danjuma to be more </p><p>positive about Article 98.  He stated that the other three </p><p>members had reached the same conclusion.  Danjuma said that </p><p>he believed a recommendation along these lines had already </p><p>gone to Obasanjo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3.  (S/NF) COMMENT: During a May 12 meeting with Ambassador </p><p>Jeter (REF C), Danjuma made similar comments regarding </p><p>Article 98.  During that meeting, however, Danjuma said he </p><p>would "try" to persuade Obasanjo to sign the agreement.  By </p><p>his own account, he did not make the effort.  There remains </p><p>a possibility that Nigeria could be encouraged to sign an </p><p>Article 98, possibly as a "deliverable" should President </p><p>Bush visit in the near future.  However, (assuming </p><p>Danjuma\'s account is accurate) in doing so, Obasanjo would </p><p>have to disregard the advice of the committee he </p><p>established on the subject, a move not unprecedented if </p><p>Obasanjo holds his own strong counsel on an issue (e.g. The </p><p>2001 Racism Resolution).  Obasanjo indicated he might do </p><p>just that in a June 11 meeting with Ambassador (reported </p><p>SEPTEL).  END COMMENT. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>----- </p><p>Benue </p><p>----- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4.  (C/NF) Turning to the October 2001 Benue incident, </p><p>Danjuma said he doubted that Senator Feingold would be </p><p>satisfied with the Commission of Inquiry\'s report (REF A). </p><p>Danjuma had read the report cover-to-cover, and the </p><p>Commission had not tried to identify responsible </p><p>individuals.  He commented that the military could convene </p><p>a Board of Inquiry and easily determine those within the </p><p>units who were responsible; the commander certainly knew </p><p>which elements had gone into the area. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Defense Minister </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5.  (C) Danjuma said Salihu Ibrahim would not/not be the </p><p>next Defense Minister; his successor would be a civilian, </p><p>Danjuma predicted.  Danjuma also offered that during his </p><p>second Administration, President Obasanjo would assume much </p><p>of the MOD\'s portfolio himself, possibly to the extent of </p><p>becoming the de facto Minister.  (COMMENT: Previous DAO </p><p>reporting had indicated Salihu Ibrahim would be the next </p><p>MOD (REF B).  If a civilian, we predict that Lawal </p><p>Batagarawa, former Minister of State for Defense (Army), </p><p>would be the likely candidate.  A northerner, Batagarawa </p><p>has Obasanjo\'s confidence and worked ardently for the </p><p>President\'s re-election.  END COMMENT.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>Frustration with Corruption </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6.  (C) Danjuma said, "The last four years have been the </p><p>most frustrating years of my life; there was no money."  He </p><p>opined that money was leaking from the system at every </p><p>joint in the plumbing, most particularly from the Ministry </p><p>of Finance and the CBN.  His Ministry had caught three </p><p>instances of double payment, and he thought the double </p><p>payments were intentional and contrived with the support of </p><p>Finance Ministry officials.  If the same sort of thing was </p><p>replicated elsewhere, the impact could be substantial.  He </p><p>said that corruption was particularly bad at the state </p><p>level.  He noted that roughly half the road-building </p><p>projects in Nigeria were stalled and that a third or more </p><p>of the local construction firms were either bankrupt or </p><p>nearly so because they had taken high-interest loans to </p><p>start projects for which they were not being paid. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>---------------- </p><p>Political Reform </p><p>---------------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7.  (C) Danjuma said he had tried to present some thoughts, </p><p>particularly on corruption and political reform, during his </p><p>final meeting with Obasanjo as Defense Minister.  But, he </p><p>commented wryly, "the President is not a very good </p><p>listener."  Danjuma had, he said, broached several topics - </p><p>- the most important of which he thought was improving </p><p>relations with the National Assembly -- but Obasanjo had </p><p>not let him say very much before offering his own opinions. </p><p>Danjuma said he hoped to get some more of his points across </p><p>in the coming days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8.  (C) Danjuma is a close confidant of the President.  His </p><p>negative assessment of Article 98 and that of the others on </p><p>the inter-ministerial committee tasked with examining the </p><p>issue will influence Obasanjo\'s ultimate decision. </p><p>However, in the past, Obasanjo has overruled his advisors </p><p>on issues about which he felt strongly and, possibly, this </p><p>could be one.  Indications from the Ambassador\'s June 11 </p><p>meeting with Obasanjo (SEPTEL) imply that Obasanjo may have </p><p>already come to a different conclusion from his advisors. </p><p>END COMMENT. </p><p>JETER </p><p></p></div>
