(SBU) Summary: On January 21, 2003, the Vietnamese </p><p>Supreme Court reversed a May 2002 landmark decision by the </p><p>Ho Chi Minh City Economic Court that would have recognized </p><p>an international arbitral award for the first time in that </p><p>city.  The Mission has been assisting Tyco Services </p><p>Singapore since 2001 in its attempts to get two awards </p><p>enforced in Vietnam.  Mission has also worked with the </p><p>Ministry of Justice, which had reviewed the case and issued </p><p>an advisory opinion to the Courts in support of Tyco\'s </p><p>position.  The case was perhaps deceptively simple - the </p><p>court was asked to enforce a legitimate international </p><p>arbitration award, not reopen or reargue the original </p><p>dispute.  However, at the real heart of this case is the </p><p>current lack of understanding at the highest judicial levels </p><p>of modern, market-based normal business transactions as well </p><p>as a continuing lack of transparency. </p><p>2.  (SBU) Summary cont\'d:  The Supreme Court\'s reversal is </p><p>particularly disheartening in light of the earlier decision </p><p>by the HCMC Economic Court, which helped Vietnam garner much </p><p>positive international press and good will last summer.  In </p><p>fact, the presiding judge from the Economic Court presented </p><p>a case-study at a USG-sponsored seminar that brought </p><p>together all Supreme Court judges from around the country to </p><p>discuss their important role in Vietnamese legal reform and </p><p>implementation of the BTA.  Clearly, this decision, whether </p><p>overturned on review or not, will have a negative impact on </p><p>Vietnam\'s international reputation and its ability to </p><p>attract foreign investment.  It casts further doubt on the </p><p>transparency and fairness of the legal process and raises </p><p>additional questions about Vietnam\'s ability to live up to </p><p>its obligations under the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade </p><p>agreement and the New York Convention.  Mission recommends </p><p>that this issue be raised in the context of the BTA Joint </p><p>Committee meeting, not to argue the merits of the case but </p><p>to stress our expectation that U.S. businesses will be </p><p>treated fairly by the Judicial system and that international </p><p>commitments will be respected.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p>BACKGROUND ON THE CASE AND THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) The Mission has been working with Tyco Services </p><p>Singapore Pte Ltd., a subsidiary of U.S. firm Tyco </p><p>International regarding Tyco\'s attempts to get two </p><p>Australian arbitral awards enforced in Vietnam. We had also </p><p>consulted the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to express our </p><p>interest and concerns regarding the case, the absolute need </p><p>for transparency of the hearing and the decision making </p><p>process, and the need for a full and fair hearing for the </p><p>U.S. company, especially in light of Vietnam\'s commitments </p><p>in the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade agreement (BTA).  The </p><p>Ministry of Justice had reviewed the case and had issued an </p><p>advisory opinion to the HCMC Court in support of Tyco\'s </p><p>position.  The case was perhaps deceptively simple - the </p><p>courts were asked to enforce a legitimate international </p><p>arbitration award, not reopen, review, or reargue the </p><p>original case. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU) However, at the real heart of this case is the </p><p>current lack of understanding of modern, market-based normal </p><p>business transactions by a generally unprepared and </p><p>untrained legal and judicial system.  The Vietnamese </p><p>judiciary consists of the Supreme People\'s Court, the local </p><p>people\'s courts, military tribunals, and other tribunals </p><p>established by law. The Supreme Court, which has three </p><p>regional seats - Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Danang - is </p><p>the highest court of appeal and review.  The Ministry of </p><p>Justice administers most district and provincial courts, and </p><p>the National Assembly administers the Supreme Court. The </p><p>judiciary also has Economic Courts and other specialized </p><p>courts that resolve disputes in specific fields.  The </p><p>Economic Courts have addressed few cases since their </p><p>creation in 1995.  Cases are rarely appealed to the Supreme </p><p>Court, where the judges have little experience and training </p><p>in economics, trade and finance.  In fact, most judges and </p><p>lawyers received their legal training in Socialist legal </p><p>systems and are ill-equipped to deal with market-based </p><p>concepts.  In particular, the distinction between trade in </p><p>goods and trade in services is not well understood in </p><p>Vietnam.  The MOJ attempted to clarify for the courts both </p><p>this difference as well as Vietnam\'s obligations under the </p><p>UN Convention of the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign </p><p>Arbitral awards (the New York Convention). (Vietnam is not </p><p>yet a party to ICSID, but we are actively working with the </p><p>GVN towards this goal in which the GVN has expressed </p><p>interest.) </p><p> </p><p>5. (SBU) In 1995, Tyco had provided construction services </p><p>for the Furama Resort Hotel in Danang for Hai Van Thiess </p><p>(HVT), now know as Leighton Contractors Ltd, an Australian- </p><p>Vietnamese joint venture construction company.  Tyco never </p><p>received full payment and went to arbitration in Queensland, </p><p>Australia as specified in their agreement with HVT.  In </p><p>2000, Tyco won that case, as well as a subsequent appeal by </p><p>HVT in Australia.  When HVT refused to pay the arbitral </p><p>award ($2.2 million), Tyco filed an application in 2001 with </p><p>the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice to have the award </p><p>enforced in Vietnam under the Ordinance on Recognition and </p><p>Enforcement of Foreign Arbitration Awards.  MOJ sent the </p><p>case to Danang.  However, in July 2001, the Danang Court </p><p>determined that it did not have the authority to hear the </p><p>case because the company, HVT, had moved its headquarters to </p><p>HCMC, reorganized its ownership and renamed the firm </p><p>Leighton Contractors.  In August 2001, MOJ sent the case to </p><p>the Economic Court of the HCMC People\'s Court. </p><p> </p><p>THE FIRST CASE - THE GOOD.. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU) Tyco finally had its day in court in May 2002.  In </p><p>its petition to the court to reject Tyco\'s claim, </p><p>HVT/Leighton attempted to reopen the validity of the </p><p>original arbitral award.  They argued that the application </p><p>for enforcement be denied based on the allegation that the </p><p>original Consortium agreement was invalid because it had not </p><p>been certified by the Ministry of Planning and Investment </p><p>(MPI), Tyco did not have license for foreign contractors </p><p>from the Ministry of Construction, the consortium agreement </p><p>was not a "commercial" agreement and so was not governed by </p><p>the Ordinance on Economic Contracts or the Ordinance Foreign </p><p>Arbitration, the Queensland arbitrator had violated </p><p>procedures in settling the claims, and finally, the arbiters </p><p>were biased and unfair. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (U) In its clear, well-written, and focused May </p><p>decision, the HCMC Economic Court looked at each of these </p><p>issues in a fair and legalistic manner.  The Judges Panel </p><p>confirmed that under the Arbitration ordinance, they were </p><p>not allowed to re-arbitrate the dispute and thus dismissed </p><p>the argument that the agreement was invalid.  However, the </p><p>Court went further in its decision and explored the argument </p><p>on its merits.  HVT/Leighton argued that the agreement was </p><p>invalid because the Ministry of Planning and Investment </p><p>(MPI) had not certified it and Tyco did not have the legal </p><p>capacity to sign because it did not have a license for </p><p>foreign contractors issued by the Ministry of Construction. </p><p>This argument hinges on an interpretation of the Ordinance </p><p>on Economic Contracts, which only covers agreements signed </p><p>between Vietnamese entities and foreign organizations in </p><p>Vietnam.  As the agreement was for construction services, it </p><p>was not necessary for Tyco to have a presence in Vietnam. </p><p>The Panel found that the agreement was not governed by the </p><p>Ordinance since Tyco did not have offices in Vietnam. </p><p>Therefore, the agreement could not be found invalid under </p><p>that law.  Going further, they found that even if the </p><p>Ordinance did apply, the agreement clearly stated that the </p><p>agreement would be interpreted and governed by Queensland </p><p>law in the case of disputes.  Finally, even if Vietnamese </p><p>civil law did apply, HVT would have had to take Tyco to </p><p>court within one year of its signing in order to have the </p><p>agreement invalidated.  Thus, the court ruled that Leighton, </p><p>on its own, cannot declare the agreement to be invalid in </p><p>order to avoid enforcement in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U) The second argument that the agreement was not a </p><p>"commercial relationship" and thus the arbitral award could </p><p>not be recognized or enforced in Vietnam.(previous sentence </p><p>is missing a verb or something)  This point is more </p><p>technical.  However, in sum, HVT referred to a definition in </p><p>the 1998 Commercial law that the Panel ruled it did not </p><p>apply in this case, because it was not in effect at the time </p><p>the agreement was signed. </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) The third argument that the Queensland arbitrator had </p><p>violated procedures in settling the claims was based on a </p><p>claim by HVT/Leighton that a decision by the arbiters had </p><p>added a clause to the agreement related to bank guarantees. </p><p>However, the Panel determined that this argument relates to </p><p>the substance of the dispute, and the Panel did not have the </p><p>authority to re-arbitrate the dispute. </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Regarding the fourth argument that the arbitral </p><p>decision was biased and unfair toward HVT/Leighton, the </p><p>Panel examined the arguments and found that the charge was </p><p>groundless and that the awards were issued in accordance </p><p>with Australian law, per the agreement.  Thus, HVT/Leighton </p><p>was instructed to pay the award.  HVT/Leighton promptly </p><p>filed an appeal to the Supreme Court. </p><p> </p><p>THE SECOND CASE - THE BAD? </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU) The appeal of the Economic Court\'s decision was </p><p>originally scheduled to be heard before the Supreme Court in </p><p>HCMC on August 27, 2002.  However, HVT/Leighton succeeded in </p><p>obtaining delays by changing lawyers several times, dragging </p><p>it out by almost 6 months.  The Embassy weighed in with the </p><p>Ministry of Justice to express our concern over the delays </p><p>and the fact that the Court had actually exceeded its normal </p><p>statutory time to hear the case.  When the case was finally </p><p>heard on January 21, 2003, the Supreme Court overturned the </p><p>earlier decision by the Economic Court, finding that the </p><p>arbitral award was not enforceable in Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU) Although we do not yet have the written decision, </p><p>EconOff HCMC attended the January 21 appeal hearing and </p><p>provided a preliminary readout of the proceeding.  The </p><p>presiding judge stated in the initial oral decision that - </p><p>contrary to the lower court\'s decision - the court did not </p><p>have the authority to enforce the arbitral award due to two </p><p>factors.  First, Tyco failed to apply for a license from the </p><p>GVN for its activities in Vietnam during the relevant </p><p>period.  Therefore, it was operating outside the body of </p><p>commercial law that could be used to enforce the award (N.B. </p><p>We assume he means that Tyco, as a sub-contractor for </p><p>services, was not covered under HVT/Leighton\'s construction </p><p>license).  In particular, under Vietnamese law, Tyco\'s scope </p><p>of work fell under "construction" rather than "commercial" </p><p>(i.e. service) activity, requiring a separate foreign </p><p>contractor\'s license.  Thus the Panel apparently ruled in </p><p>favor of HVT/Leighton\'s original argument (see above) and </p><p>found the agreement invalid, and thus unenforceable, under </p><p>Vietnamese law.  In essence, they ignored the arbitral award </p><p>and re-arbitrated part of the original case.  They also </p><p>apparently largely ignored the MOJ\'s advisory opinion. </p><p> </p><p>AND THE UGLY. </p><p> </p><p>13.  (SBU) Tyco\'s local attorneys told Econoff HCMC that </p><p>they were offered an opportunity to "become a friend of the </p><p>court."  (N.B. We assume that\'s codeword for a payoff.) </p><p>They declined the offer (but would not supply specifics as </p><p>to who approached them) and lost the case.  The local </p><p>attorneys believe - not provable, they note - that Leighton </p><p>took up a similar offer.  The lawyers stressed that only </p><p>strong political pressure can counterweigh any payoff that </p><p>they believe was made. (Embassy Note:  In December when we </p><p>were discussing our approach to the GVN on this issue, the </p><p>local lawyers pushed hard for the Embassy to write to the </p><p>Prime Minister, i.e. a political approach.  It was and is </p><p>our position that in light of our attempts to reform the </p><p>judicial system in Vietnam, such an approach that bypassed - </p><p>and urged the GVN to bypass - normal legal channels was </p><p>inappropriate.  We addressed this as a legal issue with the </p><p>Ministry of Justice, which we knew was also in agreement on </p><p>the legal facts of the case. End note.) </p><p> </p><p>14.  (SBU) However, Tyco\'s Hanoi-based representative was </p><p>disappointed that their local lawyers had missed several </p><p>important opportunities to clarify the legal nuances before </p><p>the Supreme Court.  He noted that he "could have done a </p><p>better job (of lawyering) himself."  (HCMC Econoff likewise </p><p>was unimpressed by the Tyco attorneys\' performance in </p><p>court.)  For example, when the Panel raised the issue of </p><p>whether Tyco required a license, the lawyers did not refute </p><p>the assumption that a license was necessary (as the Economic </p><p>Court had).  Instead, the lawyer replied that Leighton </p><p>should have told them if it were necessary.  A more </p><p>responsive answer arguing the law might have allayed some of </p><p>the court\'s concerns. </p><p> </p><p>SUPREME COURT DECISION MAY BE REVIEWED </p><p> </p><p>15. (U)  Although, the Supreme Court is the final Court of </p><p>Appeal in Vietnam, the MOJ confirms information conveyed to </p><p>Econ FSN by one local judicial contact:  Tyco can still </p><p>petition the case\'s review by senior judges in Hanoi. </p><p>However, review is case by case, and there is no mechanism </p><p>for automatic review. </p><p> </p><p>16. (SBU) Tyco clearly regards the decision as a major </p><p>setback.  As Tyco reviews its options, it has asked for </p><p>further Mission assistance in urging the GVN to enforce the </p><p>arbitral award.  We will review with Tyco their analysis of </p><p>the Supreme Court decision, in light of the earlier Economic </p><p>Court decision, and explore appropriate options for action. </p><p> </p><p>COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>17.  (SBU) This decision is particularly disheartening in </p><p>light of the earlier and much touted decision by the HCMC </p><p>Economic Court.  Vietnam garnered much positive </p><p>international press and good will last summer regarding this </p><p>landmark case, the first international arbitral award to be </p><p>enforced in Vietnam.  (N.B.  There are several other cases </p><p>before the Hanoi Courts but none is final or involves a U.S. </p><p>company.) For once, Vietnam was praised for a legal </p><p>decision. In fact, the presiding judge from the HCMC </p><p>Economic Court was invited by the GVN to present a case- </p><p>study at a USAID-STAR project seminar that brought together </p><p>Supreme Court judges from around the country to review legal </p><p>reform and BTA implementation.  When the Ambassador </p><p>addressed the Supreme Court judges at the opening of the </p><p>seminar, he stressed their important role in Vietnamese </p><p>legal reform and implementation of the BTA. </p><p> </p><p>18. (SBU) Clearly, this decision, whether overturned on </p><p>review or not, will have a negative impact on Vietnam\'s </p><p>international reputation and its ability to attract foreign </p><p>investment.  It casts further doubts on the transparency and </p><p>fairness of the legal process and also raises additional </p><p>questions on Vietnam\'s ability to live up to its obligations </p><p>under the BTA Investment Chapter.  International arbitration </p><p>clauses are a key component of any business contract signed </p><p>by foreign parties in Vietnam.  The Tyco case was the first </p><p>"successful" attempt by a U.S. firm to have an international </p><p>arbitral award enforced in Vietnam.   The high court\'s </p><p>ruling - for whatever reason - will certainly cause many </p><p>here and abroad to rate Vietnam a bit higher on the </p><p>commercial risk scale. </p><p> </p><p>19.  (SBU) Mission recommends that this issue be raised in </p><p>the context of the BTA Joint Committee meeting, not to argue </p><p>the merits of the case but to stress our expectation that </p><p>U.S. businesses will be treated fairly by the Judicial </p><p>system and that international commitments will be respected. </p><p>PORTER </p><p></p></div>
