<p>UNCLAS TEGUCIGALPA 003492 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>GUATEMALA FOR COMMATT:DTHOMPSON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: EPET, ENRG, HO, VE </p><p>SUBJECT: HONDURAS\' PETROLEUM MARKET STABLE FOR NOW, DESPITE </p><p>EVENTS IN VENEZUELA </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU) Econoff approached Texaco Caribbean General Manager </p><p>Richard Ritter (please protect) on December 30 to discuss </p><p>the effect of the oil strike in Venezuela on Honduras\' </p><p>petroleum and energy needs.  Honduras, which is party to an </p><p>agreement signed between Venezuela and other countries in </p><p>the region to purchase oil at a preferential basis, imports </p><p>approximately 50 percent of its fuel needs from Venezuela. </p><p>Texaco, which through a fuel port facility at Puerto Cortes, </p><p>is responsible for bringing in 65 to 70 percent of all the </p><p>petroleum products imported into Honduras. </p><p> </p><p>2. (SBU) Ritter confided that December has been a terrible </p><p>month for Texaco\'s operation in Honduras and that the oil </p><p>strike in Venezuela has caused Texaco since November to </p><p>reroute at least five vessels destined for Venezuela to the </p><p>Gulf of Mexico to buy crude oil on the spot market.  So far, </p><p>Texaco has not passed the increased costs to Honduran </p><p>consumers.  There have been recent price increases at the </p><p>gasoline pumps related to the rising cost of oil on world </p><p>markets, but Texaco\'s actions are absorbing some of the </p><p>costs.  Electricity prices, which are based on a formula </p><p>using oil prices from two months earlier, are actually </p><p>expected to fall in January. </p><p> </p><p>3. (SBU) Ritter affirmed Texaco\'s commitment to meeting all </p><p>of Honduras\' fuel and energy needs and will continue to </p><p>absorb the extra costs through the month of January.  Ritter </p><p>warned though, that he does not know if Texaco will be able </p><p>to continue the practice after January if the situation in </p><p>Venezuela worsens and/or events in Iraq lead to further </p><p>spikes in world oil prices. </p><p> </p><p>Palmer </p><p></p></div>
