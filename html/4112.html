<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L RANGOON 001387 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV </p><p>CINCPAC FOR FPA </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/04/2012 </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PHUM, BM, NLD </p><p>SUBJECT: NLD EXPANDS RESIDUAL PARLIAMENTARY BODY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen FOR REASON 1.5(D). </p><p> </p><p>1. (SBU)  On October 23 the Committee Representing the </p><p>Peoples, Parliament (CRPP) announced that it was appointing </p><p>four new ethnic members and inviting other political parties </p><p>to join.  The CRPP was created by the NLD and ethnic parties </p><p>in September 1998 to represent the Parliament that was </p><p>elected in 1990 but never allowed to take power.  The parties </p><p>represented by the CRPP won approximately ninety percent of </p><p>the seats in the 1990 elections.  When the Committee was </p><p>created in 1998 the regime responded harshly, arresting more </p><p>than 200 activists and Members of Parliament-elect. </p><p> </p><p>2. (C)  Expanding the CRPP at this time is an important step </p><p>in publicly consolidating ethnic support behind the NLD and </p><p>improving communications and coordination between ethnic </p><p>groups (which the junta attempts to keep isolated and </p><p>factionalized).  It also creates a good mechanism for </p><p>incorporating ethnic concerns into any NLD dialogue with the </p><p>SPDC on national reconciliation, should that occur.  The big </p><p>question is whether these actions by the CRPP will also serve </p><p>to prod the SPDC toward a dialogue or just lead to another </p><p>crackdown.  The ethnic political leaders tell us they believe </p><p>this was "the right card to play" as MP-elects with a </p><p>responsibility to show the people that they are concerned for </p><p>their well-being.  SNLD Chairman Hkun Htoon Oo also said, </p><p>however, that Military Intelligence had already contacted him </p><p>warning that he and the other ethnic groups are being </p><p>"confrontational" by officially joining the CRPP, which the </p><p>military has always viewed as a slap at its rule. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C)  The CRPP could figure in a future political </p><p>transitional phase, but the potential clout of this largely </p><p>moribund committee is difficult to judge. </p><p>Martinez </p><p></p></div>
