<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 HANOI 001932 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>DEPT FOR AEPEAP/BCLTV AND DRL/IRF </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KIRF, PHUM, PGOV, PREF, SOCI, KIRF, VM, ETMIN, HUMANR, RELFREE </p><p>SUBJECT:  RELIGIOUS FREEDOM THRU THE LENS OF A DAK LAK VILLAGE </p><p>REP </p><p>1.  (U)  This is a joint Hanoi/HCMC reporting cable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2.  (SBU)  Summary:  On July 25, during an otherwise tightly </p><p>controlled visit to the Central Highlands (septels), the </p><p>Ambassador, Emboffs, and ConGenoffs made an unscripted visit </p><p>to a mostly Protestant ethnic minority M\'nong village along </p><p>the road from Buon Ma Thuot to Dalat.  A local resident told </p><p>of some continuing government efforts to limit Protestant </p><p>worship, including the destruction of some churches and </p><p>prohibitions on worship as a community.  At the same time, </p><p>the resident specifically dismissed allegations of forced </p><p>renunciations, "invitations" to meet with police, and </p><p>arrests, and we were able to visit one apparently active </p><p>unofficial house church.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  Following official meetings with Dak Lak </p><p>provincial authorities, Ambassador and delegation traveled </p><p>by car along National Highway 27, where nearly 29,000 ethnic </p><p>minority M\'nong Protestants reportedly face restrictions on </p><p>their ability to worship, according to HCMC-based Protestant </p><p>contacts.  While the police escort preferred to remain </p><p>parked along the side of the main road, the Ambassador and </p><p>delegation ventured for an hour down a muddy path into Buon </p><p>Biap Xa Yang Tao village, Lak District, Dak Lak Province. </p><p> </p><p>4.  (SBU)  Almost immediately after entering the village, </p><p>the Ambassador encountered an ethnic M\'nong Protestant and </p><p>former USAID employee, who, with only some initial </p><p>trepidation, agreed to escort the Ambassador on a tour of </p><p>the village. </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  The village contains approximately 1000 residents </p><p>in about 100 households, often consisting of three </p><p>generations under the same roof.  While appearing generally </p><p>poor and often dressed in worn western clothing, villagers </p><p>had few real complaints about their material lives, </p><p>according to our guide.  Most children were now able to </p><p>attend grades 1-5 in the neighborhood school, although very </p><p>few made it to the provincial capital to attend high school. </p><p> </p><p>6.  (SBU)  According to this source, police destroyed the </p><p>local village "church" late last year and forbade the </p><p>predominantly Christian villagers to worship any more.  The </p><p>police had told them the church was "illegal" and would not </p><p>allow them to build a replacement.  (He said that he had </p><p>heard of other churches destroyed elsewhere, but made clear </p><p>he had not seen this for himself.  He indicated that police </p><p>directed most of their attention to houses/churches that </p><p>openly displayed a cross on the outside, or had a sign </p><p>proclaiming the location of a church.)  Worship had become </p><p>"more difficult" over the past year, but people nonetheless </p><p>continued to gather in small groups in their homes, he </p><p>claimed.  They were not allowed to worship in the community </p><p>"rong" house or school, however. </p><p> </p><p>7.  (SBU) While police had sometimes tried to make local </p><p>Christians sign documents renouncing their faith, nobody </p><p>ever complied, according to our source.  (Sources in HCMC </p><p>had earlier confirmed that there had been fewer </p><p>"invitations" from local police and fewer attempts at forced </p><p>renunciations of late.)  He said that he had heard of </p><p>ceremonies where villagers were required to drink pig\'s </p><p>blood to show they had renounced Christianity, but that this </p><p>had not happened not in this village.  Asked about </p><p>restrictions on travel, he noted that most people were too </p><p>poor even to contemplate leaving the village. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (SBU)  Our contact attributed government mistrust of </p><p>ethnic minority Christians in the Central Highlands to GVN </p><p>officials\' confusion over the term "Dega," which means </p><p>simply "people of the mountains."  He opined that the GVN </p><p>regarded his own ethnic minority group as U.S. spies. </p><p>Describing events related to the ethnic unrest of 2001, he </p><p>claimed that 10 to 20 villagers had been arrested and not </p><p>heard from since.  Their families knew where they were held, </p><p>but were not allowed to visit them, he added.  No one from </p><p>this village had escaped to Cambodia, and no one had come to </p><p>the village encouraging them to do so, he noted.  No foreign </p><p>religious workers had ever come to the village, either. </p><p>Even after facing repression, he said, "no one" in this </p><p>village supported an autonomous state.  While there were no </p><p>military units in the village on a daily basis, there was a </p><p>steady police presence to keep an eye on them, he said. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Our guide escorted Ambassador and delegation into </p><p>an ordinary wooden home, which was unmarked from the outside </p><p>but was clearly being used as a place of worship on the </p><p>inside, with rows of wooden pews, an altar with a cross, one </p><p>Bible (in Ede, a language related to M\'nong), and hymnals. </p><p>He claimed that every village had a "secret" place like this </p><p>for worship.  Formal services are held one Sunday a month, </p><p>when a pastor comes from a neighboring village, but </p><p>villagers worship in this house church or in their homes at </p><p>other times.  Lamenting insufficient supplies of ethnic </p><p>minority language Bibles, he asked for the Ambassador\'s </p><p>assistance in obtaining additional Bibles from the U.S. </p><p>Outside another nearby house, a board displayed two lines of </p><p>biblical scripture written in an ethnic minority language. </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU) Comment:  While one village cannot be seen as </p><p>truly representative of the complex picture of religious </p><p>life in the Central Highlands, it was striking how </p><p>Protestant religious life continues to flourish, despite </p><p>apparent official efforts to crack down on "illegal </p><p>activities."   Authorities must be aware of the ongoing </p><p>services, travels by pastors, existence of ethnic language </p><p>Bibles, etc., but yet appear willing to turn a blind eye in </p><p>this village as long as the residents do not attempt to step </p><p>beyond certain bounds to "flaunt" their unregistered </p><p>religious activities.  Similarly, at least in this village, </p><p>there appear to have been few if any consequences to </p><p>individuals for declining to renounce their faith. Even the </p><p>relatively tolerant official treatment of this village is </p><p>somewhat offset, however, by our guide\'s account of house </p><p>church destruction, arrests, and pervasive suspicion. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
