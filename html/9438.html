<p>UNCLAS ANKARA 004464 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PGOV, PREL, KPAO, IZ, TU </p><p>SUBJECT: IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL: TURKS UNHAPPY WITH </p><p>TURKMEN REPRESENTATION </p><p> </p><p>REF: STATE 202537 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5, b/d. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) After several unsuccessful attempts to schedule a </p><p>joint US/UK meeting to deliver reftel points to MFA\'s Iraq </p><p>department at the working level, UK Ambassador Westmacott </p><p>reportedly raised the points with MFA U/S Ziyal and DG </p><p>Burcuoglu July 15 during a previously scheduled meeting.  The </p><p>UK Ambassador described the discussion as "extremely </p><p>unrewarding" in that he received a long tirade from Ziyal and </p><p>Burcuoglu about the Turkmen situation in Iraq in general. </p><p>Westmacott tried to emphasize the positive aspects of the </p><p>GC\'s composition, including the fact that the Turkmen </p><p>representative was an Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) member and </p><p>the sole representative from Kirkuk.  When the Turks noted </p><p>peevishly that she was not on the leadership council of the </p><p>ITF, Westmacott reportedly retorted that, were there any </p><p>"constructive" candidates on ITF\'s leadership council, they </p><p>might have been considered.  After some prodding, the Turks </p><p>said they might consider issuing a statement supportive of </p><p>the GC, but would possibly include that they had concerns </p><p>about the composition of the council.  DCM also raised the </p><p>issue of the Council with Burcuoglu at a luncheon July 15. </p><p>Burcuoglu similarly objected to the number of Turkmen as well </p><p>as the absence of clear ITF leadership.  He said the MFA was </p><p>meeting later that day to decide how to react to the Council. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (S) Comment: The UK Embassy assessed that the Turks are </p><p>still smarting far too much from the July 4 incident to have </p><p>a productive dialogue on this topic now.  The points have </p><p>been raised, and we agree it would be best to let this topic </p><p>rest until some of the emotion fades. </p><p>PEARSON </p><p></p></div>
