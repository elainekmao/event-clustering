END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>2.  On July 10, DCM delivered Reftel demarche to Tadeous </p><p>Chifamba, Director of Multilateral Affairs in Zimbabwe,s </p><p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who had no objections to any of </p><p>the U.S. initiatives. PolOff and Chifamba,s assistant Winnie </p><p>Moyo were note takers. </p><p> </p><p>3. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responses to each </p><p>initiative follow: </p><p> </p><p>A. Women & Political Participation: Chifamba indicated that </p><p>Zimbabwe would support any initiative that empowers women to </p><p>become meaningful participants in the political process.  He </p><p>cited Zimbabwe as one of the leaders in sub-Saharan Africa on </p><p>this score. </p><p> </p><p>B. HIV/AIDS Resolution: Chifamba indicated that Zimbabwe did </p><p>not object to this initiative but then groused about </p><p>Zimbabwe,s exclusion from President Bush,s $15 billion AIDS </p><p>initiative.  He expressed concern that access to HIV/AIDS </p><p>funds not be politicized, arguing that HIV/AIDS does not </p><p>respect borders and could easily spread from a funded country </p><p>to a non-funded country.  He said to exclude a country from </p><p>receiving funds is not humanitarian. </p><p> </p><p>C. Second Committee Reform: Chifamba said Zimbabwe had no </p><p>problems with reform but argued that the pledged Monterrey </p><p>funds were inadequate to meet the Summit,s objectives.  He </p><p>also said that although ODA and FDI are welcome, increased </p><p>market access would do more to aid development.  DCM </p><p>mentioned that AGOA had been successful for participating </p><p>countries but that it was up to Zimbabwe to meet the </p><p>eligibility requirements associated with AGOA. </p><p> </p><p>D. Cyber-Crime/Cyber-Security: Chifamba indicated that </p><p>Zimbabwe was neutral on this issue but he expressed concern </p><p>over the digital divide and ways to increase connectivity </p><p>within Zimbabwe. </p><p> </p><p>E. Cloning: Chifamba said Zimbabwe was in &100 percent </p><p>agreement8 with the U.S. on banning human embryonic cloning </p><p>but would like to go beyond that to ban cloning of all life </p><p>forms.  He did not comment to co-sponsorship of a resolution. </p><p> </p><p>F. UN Budget Discipline: Chifamba agreed that the UN needs to </p><p>exercise some budgetary discipline particularly in the realm </p><p>of the UN specialized agencies (eg. WFP, UNDP, FAO), which </p><p>often engage in money-wasting identical projects, but would </p><p>not agree with the U.S. beyond this area.  He said the reform </p><p>of UNSC membership and rules was a top priority for Zimbabwe, </p><p>as far as U.N. reform is concerned. </p><p>SULLIVAN </p><p></p></div>
