<p>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ABUJA 001606 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/29/2012 </p><p>TAGS: EIND, PGOV, EFIN, ECON, NI </p><p>SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON CORRUPTION REDUCED BUT FAR FROM </p><p>ELIMINATED BY PRESIDENT OBASANJO\'S DUE PROCESS INITIATIVE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1. (U) Classified by Charge Timothy D. Andrews; Reasons 1.5 </p><p>(b) and (d). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. (S) Summary. Due Process Certification is the Obasanjo </p><p>Administration\'s most effective anti-corruption measure to </p><p>date.  The process requires what appears to be a cost-benefit </p><p>analysis for all GON capital expenditures over N1 million </p><p>and, according to the Presidential Special Advisors in charge </p><p>of the process, it has saved the GON billions of Naira the </p><p>past six months alone.  Executive branch officials, including </p><p>the Minister of Solid Minerals, have commented that Due </p><p>Process Certification has tightened belts, forcing Ministers </p><p>to apply rational pricing and transparency to their </p><p>contracting practices.  However effective this process may </p><p>be, it only governs the contract award phase of the project. </p><p>There is not a similar oversight mechanism for project </p><p>implementation.   The President\'s Chief Economic Advisor </p><p>Magnus Kpakol (strictly  protect) has admitted that </p><p>significant corruption still occurs during the contract </p><p>implementation phase.  End Summary. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>3. (U) In mid-2001, President Obasanjo established the Budget </p><p>Price Monitoring and Investigation Unit (BMPI), mandated with </p><p>reviewing on all national capital expenditures over N1 </p><p>million (USD 8600.00).  In October 2001, the GON formalized </p><p>this procedure, termed Due Process Certification, in a </p><p>Circular issued by the Accountant General of the Federation. </p><p>Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili, Special Advisor to the President, </p><p>oversees the BPMI Unit and was eager to convey its success at </p><p>having saved the GON billions of Naira. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4. (U) All federal capital projects over N1 million Naira </p><p>must undergo three stages of certification: (1) Budget </p><p>Preparation Certification, (2) Contract Award Process </p><p>Certification, and (3) Work Completion Certification. </p><p>According to Ezekwesili, all capital projects contained in </p><p>the 2002 Budget had been subject to the first of the three </p><p>stages.  Each Ministry must submit its project proposals for </p><p>consideration by the President.  Every proposal must include </p><p>a feasibility study on the availability of the site, building </p><p>materials, labor and external services, such as water and </p><p>power supply, as well as an articulation of demand for the </p><p>project.  BMPI bases its decision to grant certification on </p><p>whether the project will have a positive impact on </p><p>employment, increase efficiency and productivity and improve </p><p>service to the public.  Budget Preparation Certification is </p><p>granted if the project is determined to: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Be well aligned with GON strategic and sectoral priorities; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Be adequately prepared technically and financially; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Contain reasonable cost estimates consistent with </p><p>international practice; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Include detailed project designs with appropriately </p><p>packaged components for procurement purposes; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Include detailed and realistic financing, procurement and </p><p>implementation plans; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Identify adverse environmental and social effects where </p><p>these exist; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Include an assessment of future operation and maintenance </p><p>requirements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>5. (U) Projects are granted Category 1, or full, </p><p>certification if they meet all the above criteria.  Category </p><p>2 certification is granted to projects not fully prepared but </p><p>which could be completed within the next budget cycle. </p><p>Category 3 projects are denied certification because they are </p><p>significantly flawed or incomplete. Only Category 1 projects </p><p>were included in the draft 2002 Budget the President </p><p>submitted to the National Assembly. According to Ezekwesili, </p><p>the Assembly inserted several non-certified projects prior to </p><p>the budget\'s final approval. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>6. (U) Once the budget is approved by the legislature, the </p><p>BMPI works closely with each Ministry\'s finance office on the </p><p>second stage of certification, Contract Award Certification. </p><p>Before a contract can be awarded, the following conditions </p><p>must be met: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Tender documents are prepared in line with GON guidelines; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Tender process is conducted in line with GON guidelines; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Pre-qualification criteria for contractors are </p><p>appropriate, clearly stated and fully complied with; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The lowest/best-evaluated bidder is recommended or if </p><p>management approves a different bidder, reasons for that </p><p>recommendation have been provided; </p><p>-- Contract price is comparable with international </p><p>experience; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- The successful bidder continues to meet pre-qualification </p><p>requirements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Only after the BMPI has issued the Contract Award </p><p>Certification can the Ministry sign the contract and begin </p><p>mobilizing the funds through the Accountant General and </p><p>Central Bank. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>7. (U) Any project that requires more than one release of </p><p>funds must receive a Work Completion Certification from BMPI </p><p>before the relevant Ministry is able to access additional </p><p>funds.  To receive that certification, the project must meet </p><p>the following conditions: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Earlier funds have been fully utilized; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Site visit has been carried out to assess progress; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Contract work is being carried out as agreed in contract; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Percentage of work completed is commensurate with funds </p><p>spent; and </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-- Anticipated project results are being achieved. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>8. (C) BMPI uses specialists from outside the career </p><p>government service )- sometimes even expatriates -- to </p><p>conduct these reviews.  Ezekwesili admitted, however, that </p><p>finding technically proficient and honest specialists has </p><p>been difficult.  She requested assistance from USAID in </p><p>locating and funding outside specialists, particularly for </p><p>infrastructure projects, such as roads, water and seaports. </p><p>USAID has agreed to provide this assistance to BMPI. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>9. (U) She believes strongly that, through the BMPI, </p><p>President Obasanjo has greatly reduced federal level </p><p>corruption and that, through due process, oversight over </p><p>contract procurement has been greatly enhanced.  "We have </p><p>taken meat from the table of those who normally eat pork," </p><p>she said.  Ezekwesili praised the work of the BMPI as </p><p>compared to the Anti-Corruption Commission, which she said </p><p>lacks teeth.  Inflated contracts, patronage and </p><p>misappropriation of federal resources were common occurrences </p><p>before, but no longer, she averred.  As an example, </p><p>Ezekwesili cited a project proposed by the Ministry of Power </p><p>and Steel that was going at a price well above the lowest </p><p>bidder. Certification was not granted until the contract </p><p>amount was reduced, saving the GON roughly N2 billion (USD 17 </p><p>million).  On buildings and road projects alone, she </p><p>estimated that roughly N9.7 billion (USD 83 million) had been </p><p>saved in the past six months alone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>10. (U) Ezekwesili emphasized that President Obasanjo has </p><p>given his full support to the certification process.  In </p><p>early April, she said the President informed all Ministers </p><p>during the weekly Executive Council meeting, that none of </p><p>them should bother submitting a project for the Council\'s </p><p>approval without a due process evaluation.  The Minister of </p><p>Solid Minerals Adelaja (and former Minister of State for </p><p>Defense), during a farewell dinner for the DATT on April 23, </p><p>commented that the due process exercise was extremely </p><p>positive, ensuring Executive branch contracts were rational </p><p>in scope and cost.  When some expressed concern over </p><p>potential delays due to the process, Adelaja countered that </p><p>minor delays were a small price to pay to prevent corrupt </p><p>contracting and to ensure rational projects. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>11.   (U) When asked about specific projects that are often </p><p>criticized as wasteful, such as the Abuja stadium and </p><p>National Identification Program, Ezekwesili explained these </p><p>programs pre-dated the establishment of BMPI, and were driven </p><p>by political concerns.  BMPI audited the Stadium construction </p><p>and concluded, "this project has serious deviations from due </p><p>process.  This is of particular concern bearing in mind the </p><p>huge amount of expenditure anticipated, some N38 Billion, or </p><p>$300 million equivalent.  However, given the delicate </p><p>international aspects of the project and the need for Nigeria </p><p>to demonstrate its ability to host the All African Games and </p><p>provide a sufficient range of facilities and accommodation to </p><p>do so, it would be politically impossible to recommend the </p><p>project be reviewed or delayed in any way." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>12.  (C) Comment.  We join the IMF and World Bank in giving </p><p>the GON good marks for institutionalizing due process </p><p>regarding federal capital expenditures, and will continue to </p><p>give the BMPI project support as it moves into the Ministry </p><p>of Finance Budget Office.  This project has certainly limited </p><p>the mischief in the award of government contracts.  However, </p><p>just as water will find its way  through stone, so too will </p><p>creative GON officials continue to find ways to manipulate </p><p>the contracting process for personal gain.  Moreover, as long </p><p>as the Anti-Corruption Commission "lacks teeth" (i.e., </p><p>sufficient authority and funding) and the Code of Conduct </p><p>Tribunal lacks independence, few will be punished for </p><p>engaging in (or attempting to engage in) corrupt practices. </p><p>Ezekwesili may have saved the GON USD 17 million in the case </p><p>she cited, but no heads rolled at Power and Steel because of </p><p>it.  In addition, allowing politics to override due process </p><p>is a slippery slope. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>13. (S) In a private conversation, the President\'s Chief </p><p>Economic Advisor, Magnus Kpakol, admitted that while BMPI has </p><p>reduced malfeasance, plenty of opportunities for Ministers </p><p>and other high-level GON officials to manipulate the system </p><p>still exist.  While the BMPI may ensure that contracts are </p><p>awarded at an appropriate price to an appropriate bidder, </p><p>there is no mechanism in place (except if the project has </p><p>several stages and must go through the Work Completion </p><p>Certification) to ensure that the contract is fulfilled.  The </p><p>way the BMPI is structured may actually encourage schemes </p><p>that pay the full contract amount up front thus avoiding the </p><p>site visit and work percentage requirements of the work </p><p>completion certification (see para 6).  Additionally, clever </p><p>operators can break a large project into several discrete </p><p>contracts with each less than one million Naira in order to </p><p>fall below BMPI\'s regulatory radar screen.  Several GON </p><p>insiders give much credit to President Obasanjo\'s leadership </p><p>against corruption and cite BMPI as an example.  Although a </p><p>successful step forward, BMPI\'s due process certification has </p><p>its gaps that are almost assuredly being exploited by corrupt </p><p>officials.  To further the fight against misconduct in </p><p>government contracting practices, an important step the GON </p><p>should explore is improving its oversight of the actual </p><p>performance of government contracts. End Comment. </p><p>ANDREWS </p><p></p></div>
