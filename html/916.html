<p>C O N F I D E N T I A L STATE 230033 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>USTR FOR CASSIDY/CHENG </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/08/08 </p><p>TAGS: PINR, KN, PGOV, PREL      - </p><p>SUBJECT: // INR ASSESSMENT // -   DPRK: QUACKS LIKE CAPITALISM </p><p> </p><p>DOD/ISA/AP FOR SCHRIVER; NSC FOR KRISTOFF/BADER, NSA FOR </p><p>KILMER, DIA FOR NIXON, LONDON FOR HALL, ROME PLEASE PASS </p><p>EMBASSY VATICAN </p><p> </p><p>THE FOLLOWING INR ASSESSMENT WAS PRODUCED BY THE OFFICE OF </p><p>EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC ANALYSIS AND IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR </p><p>INFORMATION AND COMMENT </p><p> </p><p>CLASSIFIED BY ROBERT CARLIN, DIVISION CHIEF INR/EAP/NA. </p><p>REASON: 1.5   (D) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.   (C) EVEN AS PYONGYANG CONTINUES TO EXCORIATE CAPITALISM </p><p>AND INSIST THAT THE NORTH WILL "NEVER CHANGE," THERE ARE   - </p><p>SIGNS THAT SOME IN THE REGIME ARE INCREASINGLY OPEN TO </p><p>EXPERIMENTING WITH CAPITALIST PRINCIPLES.    BUT CONSERVATIVE </p><p>OPPOSITION AND BUREAUCRATIC INERTIA ARE STRONG, AND THE </p><p>NORTH\'S LIMITED MEASURES THUS FAR WILL NOT BRING NEEDED </p><p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT. </p><p> </p><p>2.   (U) THIS SPRING AN OFFICIAL ECONOMIC JOURNAL CARRIED </p><p>SEVERAL ARTICLES STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH MARKET- </p><p>RELATED ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES AS COMPETITION, AUTONOMOUS </p><p>DECISION-MAKING, AND INCENTIVES.   THE ARTICLES ARGUED THAT </p><p>THE DPRK MUST MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE CAPITALIST MARKET </p><p>THROUGH MARKET RESEARCH,  STUDY OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR, PROPER </p><p>PRICING, QUALITY CONTROL, AND ADVERTISING.   THEY DISCUSSED </p><p>IN FAVORABLE TERMS JOINT-VENTURE CONTRACTS AND PROFIT- </p><p>SHARING ARRANGEMENTS, EMPHASIZING THAT FOREIGN DIRECT </p><p>INVESTMENT WOULD PROMOTE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND </p><p>IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DOMESTIC PRODUCTS.   INCENTIVES, THE </p><p>JOURNAL EMPHASIZED, ARE KEY; INCREASED PAY "INCREASES </p><p>ZEAL," AND AUTONOMY SPURS INITIATIVE. </p><p> </p><p>-THE DEBATE JOINED </p><p> </p><p>3.   (C) THE DAY THE ARTICLES APPEARED, THE PARTY NEWSPAPER </p><p>CARRIED AN AUTHORITATIVE COMMENTARY CITING THE ALBANIAN </p><p>EXPERIENCE AS A WARNING AGAINST ABANDONING SOCIALISM. </p><p>THOUGH PROBABLY NOT WRITTEN DIRECTLY IN RESPONSE TO THE </p><p>ARTICLES, THE COMMENTARY REFLECTED SERIOUS CONCERN AMONG </p><p>CONSERVATIVES THAT THE IDEOLOGICAL DIKES WERE BEGINNING-TO </p><p>LEAK. </p><p> </p><p>4.   (C) THERE ARE SIGNS THAT MORE THAN THEORETICAL JOUSTING </p><p>IS GOING ON.   HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS FAVORING PRAGMATIC </p><p>ECONOMIC MEASURES REPORTEDLY WERE DISPATCHED TO THE NORTH\'S </p><p>NAJIN-SONBONG FREE TRADE ZONE TO INVESTIGATE THE NEED FOR </p><p>NEW MEASURES.   IN JUNE, FOLLOWING UP THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS, </p><p>PYONGYANG IMPLEMENTED LIMITED STEPS TO PROMOTE MARKET </p><p>PRACTICES.   THESE INCLUDED EXPANDING THE RANGE OF ECONOMIC </p><p>ACTIVITY AUTHORIZED IN THE ZONE AND ALLOWING NORTH KOREANS- </p><p>NOT JUST FOREIGNERSWRO ENGAGE IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE RANGING </p><p>FROM SELLING SURPLUS FARM GOODS TO OPENING RESTAURANTS. </p><p> </p><p>5.   (C) THE PROCESS TOOK ANOTHER STEP FORWARD IN AUGUST </p><p>WITH PUBLICATION OF A KIM JONG IL THESIS ON REUNIFICATION. </p><p>SOUTH KOREAN FIRMS HAVE TOLD EMBASSY SEOUL THEIR DEALINGS </p><p>IN THE DPRK HAVE BECOME-MORE BUSINESSLIKE SINCE THE KIM </p><p>THESIS, WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE GIVEN NORTHERNERS AN </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL BASIS TO DEAL WITH THE SOUTH. </p><p> </p><p>COLD COMFORT </p><p> </p><p>6.   (C) IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE LIMITED REFORM MEASURES </p><p>UNDERTAKEN WOULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT WITHOUT KIM JONG </p><p>IL\'S BLESSING.   NONETHELESS, UNLESS KIM EXPLICITLY STATES </p><p>THE NEED FOR BROAD ECONOMIC REFORMS, THE PROCESS WILL MOVE </p><p>SLOWLY, ALWAYS UNDER COVER OF A PRUDENT-IF TATTERED </p><p>IDEOLOGICAL VEIL.   IDEOLOGICAL COVER IS NECESSARY TO </p><p>PROTECT THE REFORMERS, ALLOWING THEM TO ACCOMMODATE MARKET </p><p>ACTIVITIES AND PURSUE NEW MEASURES FOR DEVELOPMENT WHILE </p><p>PAYING PROPER OBEISANCE TO ORTHODOX BELIEFS.   THESE SUBTLE </p><p>SHIFTS IN PYONGYANG\'S ECONOMIC LINE WILL PROVIDE COLD </p><p>COMFORT TO POTENTIAL WESTERN INVESTORS.   BUT THEY HAVE </p><p>ALREADY STRUCK A RESPONSIVE CHORD AMONG SOME SOUTH KOREAN </p><p>FIRMS AND PROMISE TO ENCOURAGE NEW ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR IN THE </p><p>NORTH.  (JBADER) (CONFIDENTIAL) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PICKERING </p><p></p></div>
