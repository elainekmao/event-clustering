IRVING FOR </p><p>REASONS 1.5 (B/D). </p><p> </p><p>REF: A. HARARE 815, B. HARARE 743 </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>SUMMARY </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>1. (C) ON FEBRUARY 28, ECONOFF MET WITH COLLIN CLOETE, </p><p>VICE-PRESIDENT FOR COMMODITIES OF THE COMMERCIAL FARMERS </p><p>UNION (CFU), TO DISCUSS THE UPCOMING MARCH 21 CFU </p><p>SPECIAL CONGRESS AND REPORTS OF VEHEMENT DISAGREEMENTS </p><p>AT THE UNION\'S TOP LEADERSHIP LEVEL.  CLOETE, A KEY </p><p>MEMBER OF THE CFU EXECUTIVE, TOLD US THAT THE SPECIAL </p><p>CONGRESS WILL CENTER ON CONSIDERING WAYS THAT THE CFU </p><p>CAN BROADEN ITS MEMBERSHIP AND INTEGRATE BETTER INTO </p><p>ZIMBABWE\'S BLACK MAJORITY SOCIETY, AS WELL AS TO </p><p>CONSIDER DIFFERENT WAYS TO ENGAGE THE GOVERNMENT OF </p><p>ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ON LAND REFORM.  CLOETE CLAIMED, NOT </p><p>ENTIRELY CONVINCINGLY, THAT THE CONGRESS WILL NOT </p><p>CONSIDER A WHOLESALE CHANGE IN THE CFU LEADERSHIP.  HE </p><p>STATED THAT THE CFU COUNCIL HAS ALREADY AGREED THAT THE </p><p>CURRENT LEADERSHIP WILL REMAIN UNTIL THE ANNUAL CFU </p><p>ELECTIONS IN AUGUST, AND ADDED THAT THE SPECIAL CONGRESS </p><p>WILL NOT ENDORSE THE GOZ "FAST-TRACK" RESETTLEMENT </p><p>PROGRAM.  CLOETE INDICATED THAT THE ALLEGED DIVISIONS IN </p><p>THE CFU MANAGEMENT THAT WERE RECENTLY COVERED IN THE </p><p>PRESS WERE THE RESULT OF A FORMER CFU PRESIDENT, NICK </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00898  01 OF 03  031504Z </p><p>SWANEPOEL, ATTEMPTING TO CUT A SECRET DEAL WITH THE GOZ </p><p>ON THE LAND ISSUE (REF A).  END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>THE NEED TO INTEGRATE THE CFU </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2. (C) CLOETE SAID THAT THE CFU NOW RECOGNIZES THAT IT </p><p>WAS A MISTAKE NOT TO HAVE INTEGRATED ITS MEMBERSHIP BY </p><p>MERGING WITH THE INDIGENOUS COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION </p><p>(ICFU), WHICH REPRESENTS BLACK COMMERCIAL FARMERS.  THE </p><p>SPECIAL CONGRESS IS GOING TO CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF </p><p>FORMALLY APPROACHING THE ICFU TO BEGIN MERGER TALKS. </p><p>CLOETE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE SPECIAL CONGRESS WILL </p><p>CONSIDER WAYS FOR THE CFU TO BROADEN ITS OUTREACH AND </p><p>LINKS TO BLACK ZIMBABWEAN CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p>CHANGING THE LAND DEBATE TO THE COMMUNAL LANDS </p><p>--------------------------------------------- - </p><p> </p><p>3. (C) CLOETE INDICATED THAT THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF THE </p><p>SPECIAL CONGRESS WILL BE TO BRAINSTORM ON WAYS TO ENGAGE </p><p>THE GOZ AND ZIMBABWE\'S BLACK MAJORITY ON THE LAND ISSUE. </p><p>THIS EFFORT WILL CENTER ON HOW TO HELP MAKE THE </p><p>COUNTRY\'S COMMUNAL FARMING AREAS AND COMMUNAL FARMERS </p><p>MORE PRODUCTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL.  CLOETE POINTED OUT THAT </p><p>COMMUNAL LANDS COMPRISE 42 PERCENT OF ZIMBABWE\'S TOTAL </p><p>LAND, AND CONTRARY TO WHAT THE GOZ STATES, THE MAJORITY </p><p>OF THIS LAND IS NOT UNSUITABLE FOR AGRICULTURE, CATTLE </p><p>OR GAME RANCHING.  RATHER, WHAT IS NEEDED IS FOR </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00898  01 OF 03  031504Z </p><p>COMMUNAL FARMERS TO BE GIVEN THE TRAINING, </p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE AND INPUTS THAT ARE NEEDED TO MAKE THESE </p><p>LANDS PRODUCTIVE AND TO MOVE THEM FROM SUBSISTENCE TO </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMING.  CLOETE BLAMED THE GOZ FOR NOT DOING </p><p>THIS IN THE PAST, BECAUSE IT WANTED TO KEEP COMMUNAL </p><p>FARMERS POOR AND WHOLLY DEPENDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT. </p><p>HOWEVER, HE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE CFU SHOULD HAVE </p><p>TAKEN THE LEAD IN THIS ENDEAVOR WHEN THE GOZ ABDICATED </p><p>ITS RESPONSIBILITY.  THE SPECIAL CONGRESS WILL ALSO </p><p>CONSIDER HOW THE CFU CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN ORGANIZING A </p><p>COALITION OF NGOS, INTERNATIONAL DONORS, AND HOPEFULLY </p><p>THE GOZ, TO WORK ON THE ISSUE OF THE PRODUCTIVITY AND </p><p>PRESERVATION OF THE COMMUNAL LANDS. </p><p> </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p>DIVISIONS REVEALED IN THE CFU </p><p>----------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>4. (C) CLOETE STATED THAT A FEBRUARY 17 ARTICLE IN THE </p><p>GOZ-CONTROLLED "THE HERALD" DESCRIBING A SPLIT IN THE </p><p>CFU WAS INACCURATE (REF A).  ACCORDING TO CLOETE, NICK </p><p>SWANEPOEL (A FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CFU), WITHOUT THE </p><p>KNOWLEDGE OR APPROVAL OF THE CFU EXECUTIVE, CONTACTED </p><p>THE GOZ TO OFFER A DEAL TO BREAK THE IMPASSE ON THE LAND </p><p>ISSUE.  AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOZ, SWANEPOEL </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0200 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00898  02 OF 03  031505Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   OIGO-00  FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  BBG-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------CD2CE5  031505Z /38 </p><p>R 031502Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8338 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 03 HARARE 000898 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/02/11 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, PHUM, EAID, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: A LOOMING SPECIAL CONGRESS COULD DETERMINE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00898  02 OF 03  031505Z </p><p>FATE OF ZIMBABWE\'S COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION </p><p> </p><p>REQUESTED THE CFU EXECUTIVE TO CONVENE A SPECIAL COUNCIL </p><p>MEETING, WHICH WAS HELD ON FEBRUARY 13.  AT THE MEETING, </p><p>SWANEPOEL REVEALED THE DEAL THAT HE HAD PRESENTED TO THE </p><p>GOZ (REF A).  THE COUNCIL DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE </p><p>INDEPENDENT AND UNAUTHORIZED APPROACH WERE QUITE WIDE- </p><p>RANGING AND ANIMATED, AND INCLUDED THE WITHDRAWAL OF CFU </p><p>AND INDIVIDUAL FARMER LAWSUITS AGAINST THE GOZ, PUBLICLY </p><p>ENDORSING "FAST-TRACK", AND LOBBYING INTERNATIONAL </p><p>DONORS TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM FINANCIALLY, ACCORDING TO </p><p>CLOETE.  SWANEPOEL THEN DROPPED THE OTHER SHOE, </p><p>REVEALING THAT THE DEAL ALSO ENTAILED THE RESIGNATION OF </p><p>THE CFU EXECUTIVE AND THE CHANGING OF THE NAME OF THE </p><p>CFU. </p><p> </p><p>5. (C) THIS LED TO A VERY HEATED DISCUSSION, WHERE </p><p>CERTAIN COUNCIL MEMBERS, LED BY SWANEPOEL, CRITICIZED </p><p>THE CURRENT CFU EXECUTIVE FOR BEING PART OF THE PROBLEM </p><p>FARMERS FACE IN REACHING A DEAL WITH THE GOZ TO DEFUSE </p><p>THE LAND CRISIS.  SWANEPOEL SINGLED OUT CFU PRESIDENT </p><p>TIM HENWOOD, DIRECTOR DAVID HASLUCK, AND VICE-PRESIDENT </p><p>FOR REGIONS WILLIAM HUGHES AS PEOPLE WHO HAD TO GO. </p><p>AFTER AN HOUR OF HEATED DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN AND AMONGST </p><p>THE COUNCIL AND EXECUTIVE MEMBERS, THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>DECLARED THAT IF THEY WERE PART OF THE PROBLEM, AND DID </p><p>NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE COUNCIL, THEY WOULD ALL </p><p>RESIGN.  THE EXECUTIVE MEMBERS THAN ALL WALKED OUT, AND, </p><p>ACCORDING TO CLOETE, LEFT THE COUNCIL MEMBERS STUNNED. </p><p>AN HOUR LATER, THE COUNCIL PHONED ALL THE EXECUTIVE </p><p>MEMBERS AND REQUESTED THAT THEY RETURN TO CFU </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00898  02 OF 03  031505Z </p><p>HEADQUARTERS.  WHEN THE EXECUTIVE WAS ALL PRESENT, THE </p><p>COUNCIL INFORMED THEM THAT THEY DID NOT ACCEPT THEIR </p><p>RESIGNATIONS AND THAT THEY CONTINUED TO RECEIVE THE FULL </p><p>SUPPORT AND BACKING OF THE COUNCIL.  WITH THIS VOTE OF </p><p>CONFIDENCE, THE UNION LEADERSHIP DECIDED TO MOVE AHEAD </p><p>BY CALLING A SPECIAL CONGRESS TO CONSIDER THE STEPS </p><p>ALREADY DESCRIBED. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p>THE MACHIAVELLIAN MANEUVERS OF A FORMER PRESIDENT </p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---- </p><p> </p><p>6. (C) CLOETE STATED THAT THE DIVISIONS IN THE CFU WERE </p><p>THE RESULT OF THE MACHIAVELLIAN MANEUVERS OF SWANEPOEL. </p><p>HIS DEAL WITH THE GOZ WAS INDEPENDENT OF THE PRIVATE </p><p>SECTOR INITIATIVE (REF B) THAT THE CFU EXECUTIVE </p><p>SUPPORTS, AND ALSO WENT BEYOND THE EXECUTIVE\'S </p><p>APPOINTMENT OF A SMALL GROUP OF CFU MEMBERS TO ENGAGE </p><p>THE GOZ.  CLOETE ALLEGED THAT SWANEPOEL HAS A HISTORY OF </p><p>CONNIVING AGAINST CFU EXECUTIVES WITH WHOM HE DOES NOT </p><p>AGREE.  CLOETE CITED AN INCIDENT WHEN SWANEPOEL </p><p>CONVINCED THE COUNCIL TO REMOVE A CFU PRESIDENT SO </p><p>SWANEPOEL COULD COMPLETE THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM. </p><p>ACCORDING TO CLOETE, SWANEPOEL TOLD THE COUNCIL AT THE </p><p>FEBRUARY 13 MEETING THAT HE WAS GOING TO THE UNITED </p><p>STATES TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT BUSH OVER HIS DEAL, AND HE </p><p>WOULD BE RETURNING WITH US $60 MILLION TO FUND LAND </p><p>REFORM.  HE ALSO ALLEGEDLY SAID THAT HE WAS AVAILABLE TO </p><p>TRAVEL ANYWHERE IN ZIMBABWE TO MEET WITH FARMERS WHO </p><p>WANTED TO DISCUSS HIS PLAN BECAUSE HE HAD ACCESS TO THE </p><p>HELICOPTER OF ZIMBABWE ARMS DEALER JOHN BREDENKAMP. </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00898  02 OF 03  031505Z </p><p>CLOETE ASSERTED THAT SWANEPOEL HAS ALWAYS MAINTAINED </p><p>CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ZANU-PF POLITICIANS, SOCIALLY </p><p>AND OTHERWISE.  WE HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER SOURCES THAT </p><p>SWANEPOEL IS PERHAPS THE ONLY COMMERCIAL FARMER WHOM </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE TRUSTS.  ACCORDING TO CLOETE, SWANEPOEL </p><p>TOLD THE CFU COUNCIL THAT ONE OF HIS ZANU-PF CONTACTS </p><p>HAD TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS TIME TO MAKE A DEAL WITH THE </p><p>GOZ ON LAND, OR THERE SOON WOULD BE 300 WHITE FARMERS </p><p>ROUNDED UP AND KILLED.  SWANEPOEL WOULD NOT TELL THE </p><p>COUNCIL WHO HAD TOLD HIM THIS OR WHO WOULD DO THIS, ONLY </p><p>THAT HE WAS THE MESSENGER. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>7. (C) ALTHOUGH CLOETE TOLD US THAT THE COUNCIL ENDED UP </p><p>BACKING THE CURRENT EXECUTIVE, HIS DEMEANOR AND DELIVERY </p><p>LEFT US LESS THAN WILLING TO BET THE FARM ON ITS </p><p>CONTINUING TO DO SO.  WE ASSESS SWANEPOEL\'S EFFORT TO </p><p>CUT A SECRET DEAL WITH THE GOZ AS ILL-TIMED AND ILL- </p><p>ADVISED AND ONE THAT COULD UNDERMINE THE CFU AS AN </p><p>INSTITUTION.  THE CFU\'S EFFORTS TO ASSIST AND ALIGN </p><p>ITSELF MORE CLOSELY TO THE BLACK FARMING COMMUNITY, BOTH </p><p>COMMERCIAL AND COMMUNAL, IS, AT THIS STAGE, LIKELY TOO </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>                           CONFIDENTIAL     PTQ0201 </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 01        HARARE  00898  03 OF 03  031505Z </p><p>ACTION AF-00 </p><p> </p><p>INFO  LOG-00   NP-00    AGRE-00  AID-00   AMAD-00  ACQ-00   CIAE-00 </p><p>      COME-00  DINT-00  DODE-00  DOTE-00  SRPP-00  DS-00    EB-00 </p><p>      EUR-00   OIGO-00  FAAE-00  FBIE-00  VC-00    H-01     TEDE-00 </p><p>      INR-00   IO-00    LAB-01   L-00     VCE-00   AC-01    NSAE-00 </p><p>      OIC-02   OMB-01   OPIC-01  PA-00    PM-00    PRS-00   ACE-00 </p><p>      P-00     SP-00    STR-00   TRSE-00  USIE-00  BBG-00   PMB-00 </p><p>      DSCC-00  PRM-01   DRL-02   G-00     NFAT-00  SAS-00     /010W </p><p>                  ------------------CD2CE9  031505Z /38 </p><p>R 031502Z MAR 01 </p><p>FM AMEMBASSY HARARE </p><p>TO SECSTATE WASHDC 8339 </p><p>INFO NSC WASHDC </p><p>SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY </p><p>AMEMBASSY NAIROBI </p><p> </p><p>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 03 HARARE 000898 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR JFRAZER </p><p>LONDON FOR CGURNEY </p><p>PARIS FOR BWILLIAMS </p><p>NAIROBI FOR PFLAUMER </p><p>PASS USAID FOR AFR/SD - DWELLER, AFR/SA - CPALMA, </p><p>NNEWMAN, AA/AFR - VDICKSON-HORTON </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/02/11 </p><p>TAGS: EAGR, PGOV, PHUM, EAID, PINR, ZI </p><p>SUBJECT: A LOOMING SPECIAL CONGRESS COULD DETERMINE THE </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 02        HARARE  00898  03 OF 03  031505Z </p><p>FATE OF ZIMBABWE\'S COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION </p><p> </p><p>LITTLE AND TOO LATE TO REDUCE THE GOZ PRESSURE ON WHITE </p><p>COMMERCIAL FARMERS, BUT NEVERTHELESS A MOVE THAT SHOULD </p><p>BE ENCOURAGED. </p><p> </p><p>8.

WE BELIEVE THE UPCOMING </p><p>CONGRESS MAY BE A WATERSHED EVENT, NOT FOR BREAKING THE </p><p>IMPASSE WITH MUGABE OVER LAND, BUT IN DETERMINING </p><p>WHETHER THE CFU REMAINS A UNITED ORGANIZATION </p><p>REPRESENTING COMMERCIAL FARMERS, OR ENDS UP COLLAPSING </p><p>INTO DISSENTING FACTIONS THAT WILL TRY TO CUT INDIVIDUAL </p><p>DEALS WITH THE GOZ TO SAVE THEMSELVES.
