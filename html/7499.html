<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 03 HANOI 000956 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>SENSITIVE </p><p> </p><p>STATE FOR EAP/BCLTV, EAP/J </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: PREL, ETRD, EAID, ECON, PGOV, JA, VM </p><p>SUBJECT:  VIETNAM\'S PRIME MINISTER VISITS JAPAN: </p><p>--          NO SURPRISES </p><p> </p><p>REF:  A.  02 Hanoi 1124  B.  02 Hanoi 2493 </p><p> </p><p>1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  Prime Minister Phan Van Khai\'s recent </p><p>visit to Japan avoided potentially controversial political </p><p>issues such as Iraq and North Korea, instead focusing on </p><p>economic relations and aid.  There is optimism that a </p><p>bilateral investment agreement may be signed by the "end of </p><p>this year" but many doubt whether it will have much real </p><p>positive impact on attracting new investment.  Vietnam </p><p>pledged to use Japan\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) </p><p>more effectively.  Khai\'s trip was probably aimed at </p><p>reassuring both domestic audiences concerned about the </p><p>economy and foreign audiences wondering about a simultaneous </p><p>visit to Beijing by the Vietnamese Communist Party chief. </p><p>END SUMMARY. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p>IN LINE WITH TRADITION. . . </p><p>--------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  (U)  PM Khai visited Japan April 6 - 12 in the latest of </p><p>several high-level bilateral exchanges.  Communist Party of </p><p>Vietnam (CPV) General Secretary Nong Duc Manh visited last </p><p>October (ref b); Manh had been to Japan in 1995 in his </p><p>previous role as National Assembly chairman.  Then-CPV </p><p>General Secretary Do Muoi and then-Prime Minister Vo Van </p><p>Kiet visited in 1995 and 1993, respectively.  Japanese Prime </p><p>Minister Junichiro Koizumi came to Vietnam in April 2002 </p><p>(ref a).  Key officials accompanying Khai on this trip </p><p>included: </p><p> </p><p>--Minister of Planning and Investment Vo Hong Phuc; </p><p>--Minister of Trade Truong Dinh Tuyen; </p><p>--Office of the Government Director Doan Manh Giao; </p><p>--Minister of Industry Hoang Trung Hai; </p><p>--Minister of Post and Telecommunications Do Trung Ta; and, </p><p>--leaders from 12 provinces. </p><p>In addition to the GVN officials, about 60 business people, </p><p>from both state-owned and private enterprises, accompanied </p><p>Khai. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (SBU)  While PM Khai was in Japan, CPV General Secretary </p><p>Manh was visiting the PRC (septel).  Tran Quang Minh, </p><p>Assistant Director of the Japan Studies Center of Vietnam\'s </p><p>National Center for Social Sciences and Humanities, </p><p>downplayed the nearly simultaneous timing of the visits, </p><p>noting that "this was not the first time" that Vietnam\'s top </p><p>leadership had been out of the country simultaneously. </p><p>According to Japanese emboffs, PM Khai\'s visit was arranged </p><p>with relatively little lead time, with the GVN suddenly </p><p>announcing its desired dates.  (Note:  GVN high-level visits </p><p>to the U.S. frequently unfold in a similar manner.  End </p><p>note) </p><p> </p><p>4.  (U)  Khai spent most of his time in Tokyo, but did spend </p><p>part of a day in Fukuoka, where he held meetings with local </p><p>officials and participated in ceremonies marking the opening </p><p>of a new air route to Ho Chi Minh City.  He then spent his </p><p>last day in Osaka, meeting with civic and business leaders, </p><p>before returning to Vietnam.  In addition to meeting with </p><p>his counterpart in Tokyo, Khai held "about 20 separate </p><p>meetings" with Japanese ministers for finance, economy, </p><p>trade, and industry, as well as parliamentarians and </p><p>business leaders, according to press reports.  Matsushita </p><p>and the GVN\'s Ministry of Planning and Investment signed a </p><p>memorandum of understanding for the company\'s plans to </p><p>establish home appliance manufacturing facilities in </p><p>Vietnam. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------- </p><p>AVOIDING POLITICAL ISSUES </p><p>------------------------- </p><p> </p><p>5.  (SBU)  According to Japanese emboffs, there were no </p><p>genuinely substantive discussions of political issues, </p><p>especially given that the large meeting in which the two </p><p>prime ministers participated lasted only about fifty </p><p>minutes, including time for interpretation.  Emboffs </p><p>recounted that, prior to the visit, a Ministry of Foreign </p><p>Affairs Deputy Director General responsible for the Middle </p><p>East had sought reassurances that the Japanese side was not </p><p>planning to raise Iraq; he was clearly concerned of the </p><p>possibility that the two sides would openly disagree.  As a </p><p>result, neither side discussed the situation in Iraq or the </p><p>Middle East. </p><p>6. (SBU)  Regarding North Korea, PM Khai reiterated </p><p>Vietnam\'s policy in favor of a nuclear-free Korean </p><p>Peninsula, while PM Koizumi expressed concern about recent </p><p>developments and called upon all those with good relations </p><p>with Pyongyang to weigh in with the DPRK leadership.  PM </p><p>Khai responded that Vietnam\'s ability to influence the </p><p>situation in the Korean Peninsula was "very limited," and </p><p>suggested instead that the PRC and Russia had more influence </p><p>with Pyongyang.  At a subsequent press conference, PM Khai </p><p>reiterated publicly Vietnam\'s view that the United Nations </p><p>should have a central role in Iraq\'s reconstruction.  He </p><p>also pleaded for more international assistance to help </p><p>Vietnam "overcome the effects of Agent Orange." </p><p>--------- </p><p>TRADE/ODA </p><p>--------- </p><p>7.  (SBU)  Vietnamese media highlighted PM Khai\'s discussion </p><p>of a long-awaited bilateral investment agreement, which the </p><p>two sides agreed in principle during the visit to complete </p><p>by the end of 2003.  The Japan Studies Center\'s Minh said </p><p>that "technical" sticking points revolve around finance, </p><p>banking, and insurance.  According to Japanese emboffs, </p><p>however, the GOJ had proposed such an agreement in 1999 but </p><p>were now no longer particularly interested, nor did they </p><p>believe it would make much difference to Japanese investors. </p><p>At this point, Japanese investors are more concerned about </p><p>the larger investment environment, and the need for </p><p>increased "transparency and predictability," they noted. </p><p>They cited in particular recent problems caused by "sudden </p><p>and unexpected" tariff increases imposed on imported </p><p>Japanese motorbike kits (and auto kits), an issue that also </p><p>came up during General Secretary Manh\'s visit last April. </p><p>Japanese businesses also want to see more open markets, the </p><p>emboffs added.  Separately, Japanese Embassy Econ/C </p><p>confirmed that Japan was seeking "BTA MFN" for Japan </p><p>investors, i.e., service sector market access. </p><p> </p><p>8.  (U)  Also during the visit, the two sides agreed to </p><p>establish a Vietnam - Japan Joint Committee to study the </p><p>investment climate in Vietnam.  The Committee will be co- </p><p>chaired by Vietnam\'s Minister of Planning and Investment, </p><p>Vietnam\'s ambassador to Japan, Japan\'s ambassador to </p><p>Vietnam, and the head of the Japan - Vietnam Committee. </p><p>Japanese emboffs said that the two sides hope that this </p><p>committee will improve the overall economic relationship and </p><p>investment environment in Vietnam.  Separately, the Japan </p><p>Studies Center\'s Minh opined that the GVN hopes to </p><p>"reassure" the Japanese business community that Vietnam is a </p><p>"reliable investment partner."  Japan is the third-largest </p><p>investor (after Singapore and Taiwan); Japanese emboffs </p><p>expressed puzzlement that PM Khai had claimed publicly </p><p>during his visit that Japan was the leading foreign </p><p>investor.  Japan has 364 projects capitalized at just over </p><p>USD 4.2 billion to date, covering industry, agriculture, </p><p>forestry, post and telecommunications, and hotel services. </p><p>Japan is also Vietnam\'s largest trading partner, with two- </p><p>way trade valued at almost USD five billion in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>9.  (SBU)  Japan is Vietnam\'s largest ODA (much or most of </p><p>it in the form of soft loans, rather than grants, however) </p><p>donor and had pledged USD 8.2 billion from 1999 - 2002, </p><p>according to press reports.  For the current fiscal year, </p><p>Japan has pledged about USD 783 million.  Japan represents </p><p>about 40 percent of Vietnam\'s total ODA.  Despite Japan\'s </p><p>difficult economic situation, Vietnam was one of the few ODA </p><p>recipients not to suffer funding cuts this year, according </p><p>to Japanese emboffs.  Japanese officials emphasized to PM </p><p>Khai and his delegation that Vietnam needs to use Japan\'s </p><p>ODA "more effectively."  PM Khai, for his part, thanked </p><p>Japan for its assistance and pledged that Vietnam would use </p><p>its reform process to maximize Japan\'s assistance. </p><p> </p><p>------- </p><p>NO SARS </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>10.  (SBU)  According to Japanese emboffs, neither side </p><p>discussed the SARS outbreak in Vietnam or the region.  Japan </p><p>has neither attempted to limit Vietnamese tourists or </p><p>workers from coming to Japan, nor issued any travel warnings </p><p>to Japanese citizens coming to Hanoi.  About 220,000 </p><p>Japanese tourists visited Vietnam in 2002. </p><p> </p><p>------------ </p><p>WHAT\'S NEXT? </p><p>------------ </p><p> </p><p>11.  (SBU)  The next big event on the horizon is the 30th </p><p>anniversary of bilateral relations in September 2003. </p><p>Celebrations are planned in both countries.  However, they </p><p>are likely to be modest, emboffs predicted, since Japan has </p><p>a "limited budget" to fund such events.  While Vietnam is </p><p>hoping for an imperial visit, emboffs predicted that this </p><p>was "unlikely."  The two Prime Ministers will visit each </p><p>other\'s country to participate in multilateral fora such as </p><p>the Asia-Europe Meeting in Hanoi in 2004 and the ASEAN + </p><p>Japan Commemorative Summit scheduled for December 2003 in </p><p>Japan.  One of Vietnam\'s deputy prime ministers will likely </p><p>visit Tokyo during the 30th anniversary celebration. </p><p>------- </p><p>COMMENT </p><p>------- </p><p> </p><p>12.  (SBU)  For such a meaty bilateral relationship, this </p><p>visit was surprisingly weak on substance.  PM Khai\'s goals </p><p>may have been two-fold:  to demonstrate to folks back home </p><p>the personal efforts he is making to energize one of </p><p>Vietnam\'s most important economic relationships, and to </p><p>counterbalance in the minds of Japanese and other </p><p>international observers any perceived tilt toward Beijing </p><p>potentially implied by the rival visit of GS Manh to the new </p><p>PRC leadership. </p><p>BURGHARDT </p><p></p></div>
