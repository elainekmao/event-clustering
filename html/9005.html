<p>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 AMMAN 003838 </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p> </p><p>E.O. 12958: N/A </p><p>TAGS: KPAO, ECON, OVIP, JO </p><p>SUBJECT: PA AMMAN\'S WEF COVERAGE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>1.  Summary:  The June 21-23 Extraordinary Meeting of the </p><p>World Economic Forum at the Dead Sea provided the USG an </p><p>unprecedented opportunity to highlight for much of the </p><p>world\'s media  -- and, in particular, the usually </p><p>ultra-critical Arab satellite TV channels -- positive </p><p>messages and new foreign policy intiatives toward the nations </p><p>of the Middle East.  The main achievement was getting out our </p><p>MEFTA and MEPI messages as well as U.S. dedication to the </p><p>Road Map through the Arab satellites and regional as well as </p><p>local print media.  This was in vivid contrast to the </p><p>skeptical or outright accusatory prism through which Arab </p><p>media often portray U.S. policies towards the region.  U.S. </p><p>delegates to the Forum put on a media blitz, ensuring the </p><p>fullest possible coverage of U.S. initiatives, and marking a </p><p>major step forward in laying out both the broad vision as </p><p>well as the details of the Administration\'s Middle East </p><p>policy.  PA Amman thanks all delegation members and their </p><p>staffs for their willingness to cooperate in these </p><p>activities, appearing willingly under the lights for multiple </p><p>television, radio, print and electronic media sessions </p><p>throughout the conference.  PA Amman also thanks NEA/PD and </p><p>IIP for their excellent support by providing critical TDY </p><p>personnel, without which our efforts could not have been </p><p>carried out.  End summary. </p><p> </p><p>--------------- </p><p>Deeds and Words </p><p>--------------- </p><p> </p><p>2.  The WEF Dead Sea meeting was a major media event.  With </p><p>over 400 journalists accredited to cover the conference, it </p><p>offered the USG an unprecedented platform from which to </p><p>highlight a number of positive U.S. initiatives towards the </p><p>Middle East.  Building a strong and coherent message of hope </p><p>and opportunity around the President\'s proposal of a U.S. - </p><p>Middle East Free Trade Area and his personal commitment to </p><p>implementation of the Roadmap, U.S. proposals dominated </p><p>discussion at the Forum, and the media reporting that </p><p>followed.  The strongest message of all, however, was sent by </p><p>the sheer size and seniority of the U.S. delegation.  The </p><p>image of Secretary Powell, USTR Zoellick, Ambassador Bremer, </p><p>USAID Administrator Natsios, U/S Larson, A/S Burns, DAS </p><p>Cheney, senior House and Senate delegations and many other </p><p>senior USG officials participating in sessions and appearing </p><p>before the media conveyed a message of confidence in a new, </p><p>integrated U.S. approach to this troubled region which </p><p>addresses not only its conflicts but the desire for </p><p>prosperity, freedom and hope.  The decision to embrace this </p><p>Forum and to use it as an opportunity to convey this </p><p>integrated U.S. approach made for a powerful message. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Over a week prior to the conference, NEA/PD forwarded to </p><p>PA Amman a memo laying out a pre-conference press plan of </p><p>speeches, DVC\'s and on-the-record briefings that would set </p><p>the stage for the U.S. messages to be delivered at the </p><p>conference.  These included U/S Larson\'s appearance at the </p><p>Foreign Press Center and the IIP-drafted op-ed for </p><p>Ambassadors that Amman placed locally on June 21.  These </p><p>efforts provided post a basis upon which to prepare a media </p><p>strategy for the period covering the Forum.  Without </p><p>confirmation of availability or willingness of Department </p><p>principals to engage media at the conference, PA Amman </p><p>developed a press plan that sought to generate wide exposure </p><p>and understanding of USG initiatives at the WEF.  These </p><p>included the MEFTA, but also MEPI, USAID activities in the </p><p>region, and Iraq rebuilding efforts.  Our proposals were </p><p>forwarded to the Secretary\'s party en route to the conference </p><p>and we received encouragement to engage as many USG delegates </p><p>as possible in support of our media strategy. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p>So Many Messages, So Many Messengers </p><p>------------------------------------ </p><p> </p><p>4.  When we began contacting principals with ideas for media </p><p>appearances, we found near-universal willingness to engage. </p><p>With so many media outlets represented at the Forum, in </p><p>particular among the Arab media, our challenge became not </p><p>convincing USG officials to appear before media, but how to </p><p>choose the appropriate outlets to maximize the impact of </p><p>their time.  And as the conference got underway and USG </p><p>proposals came to dominate the agenda, more and more media </p><p>requests came in.  While we do not have a clear baseline from </p><p>which to measure, we believe that more USG officials engaged </p><p>more Arab media in this 3-day period than may have ever been </p><p>done before.  In addition to plenary addresses and press </p><p>conferences by US delegates to the Forum -- each of which was </p><p>covered extensively by regional and international media, PA </p><p>Amman organized the following media appearances: </p><p> </p><p>-- Secretary Powell one-on-one interviews with Al Jazeera, </p><p>Arabiya and Jordan Television Satellite networks; </p><p> </p><p>-- USTR Zoellick one-on-one interviews with Al Jazeera,Abu </p><p>Dhabi TV, CNBC and Bloomberg News; Radio Interview with Radio </p><p>Sawa; Roundtable with Arab and International Print Media; </p><p> </p><p>-- Ambassador Bremer briefed the US traveling press corps and </p><p>offered exclusive comments to his traveling Iraqi press corps </p><p>following a bilateral meeting with UNSYG Annan; </p><p> </p><p>-- USAID Administrator Natsios briefed Arab Print Media; </p><p> </p><p>-- U/S Larson gave an open press availability to all media </p><p>reps on the first night of the Forum to preview USG </p><p>initiatives and objectives; he then did Abu Dhabi TV and BBC </p><p>Radio; </p><p> </p><p>-- A/S Burns appeared on Al Jazeera and sat for two </p><p>one-on-one interviews with Arab print media outlets. </p><p> </p><p>-- DAS Cheney briefed 12 Arab print journalists on MEPI and </p><p>US economic policy in the region. </p><p> </p><p>-- Ambassador Gnehm appeared on Jordan TV before the </p><p>conference and on Jordan Radio from the Dead Sea during it. </p><p>We also placed the IIP-drafted op-ed under his name in local </p><p>Arabic dailies on the first day of the Forum and provided a </p><p>separate op-ed under his name to a special-edition business </p><p>magazine produced locally for the conference. </p><p> </p><p>5.  We will be sending a separate cable detailing coverage in </p><p>the Jordanian press resulting from the above efforts. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------- </p><p>TDY Support Critical </p><p>-------------------- </p><p> </p><p>6. Post would like to thank NEA/PD and IIP for their advance </p><p>planning in support of the conference, as well as for </p><p>providing critical TDY support, without which we could not </p><p>have provided the coverage needed to take advantage of this </p><p>unique opportunity.  In particular, Jessica Davies did an </p><p>excellent job in coordinating media appearances for US </p><p>delegation members.  We also worked closely with the two IIP </p><p>Wireless File writer/editors sent to cover the event, Berta </p><p>Gomez and Philip Kurata, and commend their hard work in </p><p>covering so many different aspects of the Forum. </p><p>GNEHM </p><p></p></div>
