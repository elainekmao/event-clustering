(C) IN A FEBRUARY 23 MEETING WITH POLITICAL SECTION </p><p>CHIEF, MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) MP AND </p><p>SECRETARY FOR POLICY FORMULATION AND RESEARCH TRUDY </p><p> </p><p>SIPDIS </p><p>STEVENSON EXPRESSED SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT ESCALATING </p><p>HARASSMENT OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY\'S LEADERS.  SHE </p><p>RECOUNTED A TROUBLING CONVERSATION THAT HER MDC MP </p><p>COLLEAGUE, MIKE AURET, SR., HAD HAD RECENTLY WITH AN </p><p>ACQUAINTANCE.  THAT ACQUAINTANCE, WHO APPARENTLY IS WELL- </p><p>CONNECTED TO THE RULING PARTY, WARNED AURET THAT SENIOR </p><p>PEOPLE IN THE ZANU-PF HIERARCHY PLANNED TO "TAKE OUT" A </p><p>PROMINENT WHITE MEMBER OF THE MDC BY THE END OF FEBRUARY. </p><p>STEVENSON, WHO IS WHITE, SURMISED THAT THE PRINCIPAL </p><p>TARGETS WOULD BE AURET AND MP DAVID COLTART, BOTH OF WHOM </p><p>PRESIDENT MUGABE REGULARLY SINGLES OUT FOR CRITICISM, MOST </p><p>RECENTLY IN REMARKS TO THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED PRESS ON FEBRUARY </p><p>21.  STEVENSON FEARED THAT ZANU-PF THUGS COULD INTERPRET THE </p><p>PRESIDENT\'S REMARKS AS A GREEN LIGHT TO HARM AURET OR </p><p>COLTART. </p><p> </p><p>2.  (C) POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF SOUGHT ADDITIONAL DETAILS </p><p>IN A MEETING WITH COLTART ON FEBRUARY 27.  COLTART </p><p>CONFIRMED TRUDY STEVENSON\'S ACCOUNT, SAYING THE MESSAGE TO </p><p>AURET HAD BEEN DELIVERED ON FEBRUARY 21 BY JAMES MUSHURI </p><p>(PHONETIC), A SENIOR OFFICIAL OF THE NATIONAL MERCHANT BANK. </p><p>IN ADDITION, MDC ADVISOR CLIVE PUZEY TOLD COLTART ON FEBRUARY </p><p>22 THAT A LONGTIME CONTACT IN THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE </p><p>ORGANIZATION HAD TOLD PUZEY THAT COLTART IS THE TARGET. </p><p>COLTART IS CONVINCED THAT THE THREAT IS GENUINE, SINCE HE </p><p>RECEIVED SIMILAR INFORMATION FROM TWO UNRELATED </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 03        HARARE  00856  271523Z </p><p>SOURCES.  ASKED WHETHER HE HAS TAKEN ANY ACTION TO </p><p>STRENGTHEN HIS PERSONAL SECURITY, COLTART SHRUGGED, SAYING </p><p>THERE WAS LITTLE HE COULD DO.  HE DOES NOT OWN A HANDGUN, </p><p>FOR INSTANCE, AND HAS NO INTENTION OF PURCHASING ONE. </p><p>ASKED WHETHER THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT COULD DO </p><p>ANYTHING TO BE HELPFUL, COLTART ASKED THAT ANY PUBLIC </p><p>REMARKS CONTAIN A CATALOGUE OF ABUSES BY THE GOVERNMENT, </p><p>RATHER THAN ADDRESS HIS CASE INDIVIDUALLY. </p><p> </p><p>3.  (C) COMMENT: FOR SOME TIME, RUMORS HAVE CIRCULATED HERE </p><p>OF THE EXISTENCE OF A DEATH LIST CONTAINING THE NAMES OF </p><p>MDC MEMBERS.  UNTIL RECENTLY, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL </p><p>THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD GO AS FAR AS ORDERING THE </p><p>ASSASSINATION OF MDC LEADERS, OR COMMIT SUCH INFORMATION TO </p><p>PAPER IF IT TRULY INTENDED TO PROCEED ALONG THIS COURSE. </p><p>NEVERTHELESS, THE MERE RUMOR OF A DEATH LIST WOULD BE AN </p><p>EFFECTIVE TOOL IN INTIMIDATING THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION. </p><p>HOWEVER, GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS THE GOZ HAS GONE </p><p>TO RECENTLY TO SUPPRESS POLITICAL DISSENT AND ALTERNATIVE </p><p>VIEWS -- BOMBING THE "DAILY NEWS" PRINTING PRESS, </p><p>THREATENING JUDGES WITH PHYSICAL HARM AND FORCING OUT THE </p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE, BEATING UP SENIOR MDC OFFICIALS IN THEIR </p><p>HOMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AS WELL AS ORDINARY </p><p>CIVILIANS IN HARARE\'S HIGH DENSITY SUBURBS -- WE FRANKLY </p><p>HAVE STOPPED BEING SURPRISED AT ANYTHING THE MUGABE </p><p>GOVERNMENT DOES.  UNDERSTANDING THE CONSEQUENCES THAT SUCH </p><p>A HIT MIGHT BRING WITH IT, GOVERNMENT OPERATIVES PROBABLY </p><p>WOULD NOT CARRY IT OUT, BUT RATHER WOULD CREATE THE RIGHT </p><p>CLIMATE FOR A FANATIC TO DO SO. </p><p> </p><p>IRVING </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>PAGE 04        HARARE  00856  271523Z </p><p> </p><p>                       CONFIDENTIAL </p><p> </p><p>> </p><p></p></div>
